This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

PREFACE. 



Tbi8 little book is the leiiilt of twenty yean* coqperieiioOj 
on the part of the author, in houaeke^ing. The reoeipta 
wbieh it contains were, in great part, originally written down 
for her own oonyenienoe; others from time to time haye been 
added, with the hope that they mi^t be of seryioe to her 
dan^ters. She has been led to suppose that they mij^t be 
made nsefol to others also; and for this reason, with the 
advice and enoonragement of those on whom she on|^t to rely, 
thej are now published. 

Without comparing this book with *any other works of ft 
similar character, it is thought that it proposes the three &U 
lowing characteristics : 

1. It contains no receipt which the author has not herself 
tried and proved, ezperimentallj, to be good. 

2. It contains a sufficient number of receipts to meet all 
the ordinary wants of a &mily. 

3. A third object kept constantly in view has been to pro* 
vide receipts which will enable one to furnish a table hand- 
somely, at the smallest expense. 

Great attention has been given to the last point. Few per- 
sons are aware what a difference the mode ot cooking makes 
in the cost of a year's housekeeping. Without any increase 
of expenditure, one person, by means of good receipts skil- 
fully used, and by a tasteful arrangement of the table, will 



IV PBEPACB. ' 

make a feast oat of the artioles of food whioh would hare 
hardly soffioed another for the most indifferent meal. There 
are housekeepers whose table, notwithstanding great eztraya- 
gance, is always disorderly and uninviting. They do not 
know how to make use of their materials, and they never get 
beyond a ooarse, uninviting abundanoe. There are others 
who, with the cheapest materials and with very limited means, 
through good taste, good judgment, and good cooking, have 
always a table richly and handsomely furnished. 

In this, and in other respects, the intention has been to 
prepare a work fbr practical use^ One of the greatest con- 
veniences to a young housekeeper is a Cook Book, on the 
excellence of whose directions ^e may rely ; while few things 
embarrass her more than one which is filled, not with a seleo- 
tion, but with an indiscriminate collection, of receipts, good, 
bad, and indifferent, brought together hap-hazard, without any 
reference to their real value. This book has at least the 
negative merit of containing nothing inserted merely to swell 
the size of the volume ; and it is believed that it may claim 
the positive merit of containing good and economical rules, 
sufficient to meet any want^ which are likely to ooour in the 
common round of a housekeeper's life. 



PREFACE 



TO THIS IMPBOV£I> £I>ITION. 



Eight years have elapsed since I published the 
first edition of this Yolmne of receipts. Encoor* 
aged by the very &yorabIe reception it met with, 
and having been frequently solicited to enlarge it, 
I have added largely to the number and variety of 
the receipts, and have changed such as a longer 
experience showed to be susceptible of improve* 
ment. For the purpose of aiding young house* 
keepers, a few bills of &re have been given ; also, 
some suggestions with regard to furnishing the 
kitchen, and other domestic matters. 

Trusting that this work may meet the approba- 
tion of housekeepers, I respectfully submit it to 
their candid consideration.

* All kinds of raised bread or cake rise much quicker in a kitchen 
in the daytime, when the kitchen is warm, than at night, when the 
fire is out. Therefore, five or six hours in the day are equal to twelve 
at night. In winter anything made with yeast should be made 
early in the evening, that it may get started to rise before the kitchen 
is cold. I keep a piece of an old ironing-blanket, kept clean, to fold 
and lay over the cotton or linen bread-cloth, to keep the bread warm 
while rising

SOUP-STOCK, ETC. 



Salt should be rubbed on to meat for making 
i^oups, and the meat be put into cold w^ter, as 
the salt and heating the meat gradually extract its 
juices. Great care should be taken to skim all kinds 
of soup, particularly those made from fresh meats ; 
the scum rises very thick just before the soup be- 
gins to boil; then is the proper time to skim it. 

STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP. 

Put two knuckles or shins of veal, two onions, 
and two table-spoonfuls of salt, into eight quarts of 
water ; boil this six hours ; strain it into a stone jar ; 
keep it in a cool place ; when it is cold, take off the 
fat. The stock of white soups should be seasoned 
with white pepper, salt, a little mace, onions, celery 



BOUFB. 11 

and other vegetablos, not fried, as it is desirable to 
preserve the soup as white as possible. When lemon 
or wine is to be added, it should be put into the tu 
reen, and hot soup turned on to it ; for, if put into 
the soup and boiled, a great part of the flavor is lost 

BROWN STOCK. 

Take two shins of beef, one of veal, one dozen 
cloves, one dozen pepper-corns, two table-spoonfuls 
of salt, and eight quarts of water ; boil this eight 
hours ; strain it into a stone pot ; when cold, remove 
the fat. 

This is a very nice stock for brown soups, or to 
use instead of water in making gravy for any kind 
of dark meats, such as beef, mutton, venison, or 
any kind of wild fowl. All kinds of brown soup 
are better to have a piece of butter, a Uttle flour, 
and onion, browned in the soup-pot, before the water 
or stock is put in. Cloves, allspice, India soy, walnut 
catsup, in fact any kind of dark flavoring or spice, 
may be used in* dressing meats and soups brown. 

If you wish brown or white soup particularly 
clear, after taking oflF the fat, put it to boil ; beat 
up two eggs with the shells; stir them into the 
soup ; let it boil half an hour ; take it from the fire ; 
add a pint of cold water ; let it stand half ai^ hoi^r ; 
then strain it. This will give you a very clear soup. 
Then add vermicelli or macaroni; boil it about 
twenty minutes.

it*j vegetable ; the flavor is a great improvement to 
almost all kinds of meat and fish ; therefore, if liked, 
this vegetable can be added to any kind of dish, 
either as a vegetable or as flavoring. If soup is to 
be strained, merely cut the tomatoes up, and put 
them in with other vegetables ; if not, boil them a 
little, and strain them, before putting them into the 
soup. 

ON BOILING HEATS. 

Ail kinds of fresh meats, intended for the table, 
should be put into boiling water, thereby retaining 
the juices. If you wish to give a salt flavor to 
them, boil a piece of salt pork in the water before 
putting the meat in. A nice piece of boiled salt 
pork is a great addition to all kinds of boiled meats. 

Corned, salt,- or smoked meats should be put into 
cold water to cook. Great care should be taken to 
skim the scum oflf well just before the water boils ; 
for if the thick scum boils into the water, it is im- 
possible to take it all off, and it will adhere to the 
meats. 

Some persons, in boiling a leg of mutton for din- 
ner, add rice and vegetables to make a soup. In 
doing thiS| both are spoiled; the mutton is too 



SOUPS. IS 

mucli cooked, and has the flavor of the vegetables, 
and the soup is too fat. My plan is to boil a leg of 
mutton^ weighing ten pounds, about an hour and a 
half. [To dress it for dinner, see Boiled MuUon.'] 
Set away the water the mutton is boiled in until 
next day ; then take off all the fat ; put the liquor 
into the soup-pot with the bones of the mutton, 
a cup of rice, carrots, turnips, and onions, and 
pieces of the mutton; boil it two hours. This 
makes ^ nice mutton broth. If more of the mutton 
is left than is required to make soup, you can have 
a nice mince, or a mutton pie. 

Any kind of boiled meat is much better served 
in the same manner, and the water and bones used 
for soup the next day. 

If your soup is not very rich with the meat, add 
a dozen tomatoes ; they give a flavor and richness 
to soup. 

MOCK TUBTLE SODP. 

The calf's head should be soaked in cold water, and

the liquor into a stone jar, and set it away to cool 
over night, or until the fat cools ; then skim off the

a quart of cream or milk ; give it one boil) and it is 
ready for the table. 

CHOWDEB. 

Take a cod weighing about six pounds, and a 
haddock weighing four pounds ; cut them in pieces 
about six inches square, wash them clean, and wipe 
them dry, and dredge them with a little flour ; cut 
into slices about a quarter of a pound of salt pork 
and two onions; fry the pork a nice brown in a 
pot large enough to make the soup in ; then take 
out the pork and fiy the onions, and be careful 
not to burn them ; when these are done, put into 
the hot fat a layer of fish; then put in a little of 
the onion, a few bits ol pork, a little pepper and 
salt ; dredge in some flour, and, if you like the 
flavor, put in a little tomato, then another layer of 
fish, and then the seasoning, and continue this until 
the fish and seasoning are all in the pot ; split eight 
hard crackers, dip them into cold water, and lay them 
over the fish ; put in hot water enough to cover the 
fish, and after it begins to boil, let it boil thirty 
minutes. Some like half milk and half water ; it

milk is useAj the tomato should be omitted ; fof 
those who like spice, a little clove and mace, with a 
quart of red wine, is a great improvement. 

cusK 1 LA cr£mb. 

Rub the fish well with salt ; put it into a kettle, 
witiii enough boiling water to cover it ; as soon as it 
boils put it on one side where it will just simmer ; 
let it stand for an hour ; then take it up, and draw 
out all the bones. Put one ounce of flour into a 
saucepan, to which add, by degrees, one quart of 
cream or new milk, mixing it very smoothly ; then 
add the juice of one lemon, one onion chopped fine, 
a bunch of parsley, a little nutmeg, salt and pepper ; 
put this on the fire, stirring till it forms a thick 
sauce ; stir in a quarter of a pound of butter ; 
strain the sauce through a sieve ; put a little on a 
dish ; then lay the fish on to the dish, and turn the 
sauce over it ; beat to a froth the whites of six 
eggs, and spread over the whole ; set in the oven, 
and bake half an hour. Be careful to bake it onlv 
a veiy light color. This is a very handsome dish 
for company ; it is very nice without the eggs, but 
not so handsome. 

BOILED COD. 

The head and shoulders is considered the best to 
boil. Lay it into cold water, with a handful of salt 
and let it remain one hour ; then scrape and wash it 
clean, rub a little salt and cayenne pepper into the 
body, flour a cloth, pin the fish up tight, and put it

into boiling water ; after it begins to boil, let it boil 
thirty minutes, or according to the size of the fish ; 
serve it with drawn butter, with two oc three hard 
boiled eggs chopped fine, or oyster sauce. 

BAKED COD. 

A fish weighing six or eight pounds is a good size 
to bake ; it should be cooked whole to look welL 
Make a dressing of bread-crums, pepper, salt, pars- 
ley, and onion, and a little salt pork chopped fine ; 
mix this up with one egg, fill the body, sew it up, 
lay it into a large pan ; lay across it some strips of 
salt pork to flavor it ; put one pint of water and a 
little salt into the pan; bake it an hour and a half; 
baste it often with butter and flour ; dish the fish ; 
shake into the gravy a little flour, a little butter, 
and two spoonfuls of tomato or walnut catsup ; give 
it one boil, and turn it over the fish. 

BROILED SCROD. 

Take a small cod, or the tail of a large one ; sprin- 
kle a little salt over it, and let it remain over night; 
in the morning wash off the salt, and wipe it dry ; 
set the outside to the fire first, and let it broil 
gently half an hour ; when it is dished, rub it with 
a little butter and a very little pepper ; send it to 
the table very hot. 

HADDOCK. 

Cut into square pieces a haddock ; lay them into 
a saucepan, with a little salt, red pepper, a little

little flour or cracker-crums, and then put in an- 
other layer of fish and seasoning ; cover this tight, 
and let it simmer gently one hour; dish it very 
carefully, and turn the gravy over the fish. 

TO SIEW HADDOCK IN ITS OWN LIQUOR. 

Take a haddock, split it open, and take the bone 
wholly out; then cut the fish into square pieces 
about the length of your finger ; take some pounded 
mace and cayenne mixed, and put it upon the pieces 
of fish with your fingers in spots not quite an inch 
apart upon the inside; then butter the sides and 
bottom of a large stewpan, put the fiah in skin side 
down, close together, but not one upon another. 
The pan must be cold when the fish is put in ; let 
it stew slowly about an hour and a quarter ; just 
before it is quite done, mix some butter and flour 
well together, add a glass of white wine, and, when 
well mixed, turn it into the pan, and let it boil about 
ten minutes ; when ready for serving, take the fish 
out carefiilly in a deep dish, the spiced side up, and 
pour the gravy over it. 

FRIED GOD AND HADDOCK.

it is quite hot, put in the fish, and fry it h light 
brown; dish it with the fried pork; serve with 
drawn bntter in a sauce tureen. 

FBIED SMELTS. 

Split them just far enough to clean them; lay 
them in salt and water, and let them remain an 
hour ; then wash them clean, and wipe them dry ; 
have ready two eggs beat up in a plate, and some 
cracker-crums in another plate ; put about two 
pounds of lard into the frying-pan, set it on the 
fire until it is very hot, dip the smelts into the egg 
roll them in the crums, and put them into the 
boiling fat; fry them a light brown; serve them 
hot, with drawn butter. 

FRIED PERCH. 

Skin them all but the heads ; prepare them the 
same as smelts. They require a longer time to fry 
than smelts, being larger and thicker. 

Fresh cod's tongues, fried in the same way, are 
very nice. 

FRIED SALMON. 

Cut the salmon into slices half an inch thick, 
shake some flour over them, and fry them in butter, 
or in sweet oil, or with egg and crums, as smelts. 

FRIED HALIBUT

32 BBCEIPTS. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Salmon should be well cleansed, but not soaked 
in water; rub a little salt into the body; flour a 
cloth, and pin it up, and put it into boiling water. 
For a piece weighing six pounds, after it begins to 
boil, let it boil about half an hour. Serve it with 
drawn butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or lob- 
ster sauce. 

BROILED SALMON. 

it may be either cut in sjices, as fried salmon, or 
split to the tail; broil it very quick, and when it is 
dished rub some butter over it. 

BOILED HALIBUT. 

Some like the tail best, but tfie next cut is nicest, 
and a much handsomer piece to dish. Bub a little 
salt over it, and lay it in cold water a little while ; 
then wash it, and scrape it very clean ; put it into 
a floured cloth, and then into boiling water. A 
piece weighing eight pounds will require thirty, 
five minutes to cook. 

BROILED HALIBUT. 

The nape, corned, is the best piece for broiling. 
Wash it, and wipe it dry ; sprinkle a little flour over 
it ; put the outside to the fire first, and broil it mod- 
erately half an hour. When it is dished, spread a 
little butter and pepper over it.

Let them lie in salt and water a while. Make a 
dressing of bread-crums, pepper, salt, a little clove, 
a great deal of parsley, one onion, and a little salt 
Y )rk, chopped fine; mix this all up with a little

the pan a pint of water and a pint of red wine ; 
set it into the oven of the range, and do not quite 
close the door; let it stew gently one hour and a 
half; baste it very often with the wine and butter. 
When the fish is done, thicken the gravy with a

and turn it over the fish ; garnish it with slices of 
lemon, or horseradish grated. 

TO BBOIL A BLUB PISH. 

Split it in the back ; set the skin side to the fire 
first ; when done, turn the other side ; a fish weigh- 
ing three pounds requires half an hour to broil; 
when dished, rub over it a little fresh butter, and 
very little pepper and salt. 

BLUE PISH, BOILED. 

A fish weighing seven pounds requires three 
quarters of an hour to boil it. Serve it with drawn 
butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or parsley ai\d 
butter. 

TUBBOT. 

We have a fiat white-fish brought to our market, 
very nearly the same as English turbot. To cook 
them, scrape them clean ; wash in salt and water : 
wipe dry ; lay whole in a long pan ; dredge with a 
little salt and fiour; sprinkle on a little ground 
mace ; pour over it a pint of red wine and a pint of

bakes in about an hour. By putting a fish-drainer 
into the pan under the fish, you can serve it with- 
out breaking. Dish it on a long, fiat dish. Braid a 
Jttle flour into a quarter of a pound of butter ; s1;ir 
it into the gravy with two spoonfuls of anchovy

rub over it a little sweet butter ; send hot. 

After they are skinned, turn boiling water ovei 
them, and let them remain about half an hoar. 
To fry them, cut them up in pieces about six mches 
long, and fry them the same as codfish. 

BAKED EELS. 

Sprinkle some flour over them, and some pieces 
of butter ; put them into a pan with a little water

and bake them half an hour. When they are dished, 
make a gravy in the dish that they were baked in, 
with some butter, flonr, a little water, mustard, and 
catsup. Give it one boil, and turn it on the eels. 

SALT FISH, OB DX7N FISH. 

If you wish to cook a fish whole, put it into the 
fish-kettle with six or eight quarts of water at 
night ; the next morning, wash it clean out of the 
water, wash out the kettle, put in the fish again, 
with as much clean water as at first, and set it so 
near the fire as to scald, but not to boil. One hour 
before dinner-time, take the fish up into a pan of 
clean cold water, wash off all the skin and fins, 
wash out the kettle again, and lay in the fish care- 
fully; add fresh water, and set the kettle on the 
fire to boil thirty minutes ; dish it in a clean nap- 
kin, on a fish-dish ; to eat with drawn butter and 
pork scraps. 

To make what are called scraps, cut a quarter of a 
pound of fat salt pork into very small square pieces ; 
put them into a fi-ying-pan, stirring them frequently 
until the fat is extracted, and the scraps are done 
light brown. 

If you do not wish to cook a whole fish, cut it 
into pieces about eight inches square ; when dished, 
garnish with eggs boiled hard, and cut into slices, 
with boiled beets. Beets should always be served 
with salt fish.

4 DISH OF COLD OYSTERS 

Is very nice in warm weather, to serve before 
meats instead of soup. 

A DISH OP RAW OYSTERS. 

Wash the shells clean with a brush, and wipe dry ; 
lay on a large flat dish, with the deep side down. 
Each person at the table should be supplied with a 
coarse towel and a short knife to open the oysters. 
Some have the top shell taken off in the kitchen ; 
others have the oysters taken out of the shell and 
served in a deep dish. This, I flunk, is the best way ; 
but they should be left until just before serving. A 
lemon, cut in halves, should always be served with 
raw oysters. 

OYSTER PIE.

a teaspoonful of mace, a wineglass full of white 
wine, the juice of a lemon, and a very little flour ; 
give them one scald, stirring aU the time ; fill the 
patties, put on the crust, and send to the table 
immediately, as the crusts should not get soaked 
before using them. 

CURRIED OYSTERS.

MEATS. 



ROAST BEEF. 



A piece of beef weighing ten pounds requires 
two hours to roast. Allow ten minutes to every 
pound over or under this weight. Do not put the 
meat too close to the fire at first. When half done 



14 BECEIFrS. 

turn the fat out of the roaster ; then baste the meat 
with the drippings two or three times. Do not 
salt or flour it until nearly done. Just before 
dishing, dredge on a htde salt and flour, baste it 
well, and set it close to the fire to froth. 

The second cut of the surloin, the second cut Oa 
the ribs, and the back of the rump, are considerea 
the best parts for roasting. 

TO MAKE A GOOD BEEP GEAVT. 

Take the drippings from the meat after the fat hs» 
been turned off; turn into a saucepan, and add a 
cup of boiling water ; shake in a little flour and salt, 
and let it just come to a boil, stirring it all the time ; 
add a table-spoonful of soy or tomato catsup. 

BEEFSTEAK. 

s 

A rump steak is the best ; a surloin is the next 
best To broil a steak requires a quick fire. If 
cooked by a range, it should be put in front, and 
not on the top. Never use a fork to turn the steak, 
nor salt it while cooking. 

A steak half an inch thick requires ten minutes, 
and one an inch thick requires fifteen minutes. 
Have ready a hot dish ; put the steak upon it, and a 
little butter upon both sides ; salt and pepper to suit 
the taste ; adding a little tomato catsup to the gravy 
improves it. 

Waterman's patent gridiion is the best to use with 
a range.

little flour, pepper, and salt; cut up a tomato (if 
you have it), or onion chopped very fine; then 
another layer of beef and seasoning, and so on 
until the dish is filled. If you have any beef gravy, 
put it in ; if not, a little beef drippings, and water 
enough to make sufficient gravy. Have ready one 
dozen potatoes, well boiled and mashed, half a

of olives; lay them in a tin pan with a cup of 
brown stock ; sprinkle a little flour over them, and 
tet them in the oven. When half done, baste them 
with a little butter. They require about twenty 
minutes' cooking. Dish your olives; add to the

cup of spice (the spice is not to be ground), a 
piece of saltpetre the size of a nutmeg, broken 
fine ; pack the beef, when prepared, into a keg ; 
add one quart of good vinegar, and enough beef 
brine to cover the beef; let it stand about one 
week, when it will be fit for use. This will keep 
six months or more.

COBNED BEEP. 

The navel end of the brisket is the best piece to 
boil. It should be put into cold water. Just before 
it boils take the scum oflF. A piece of beef weigh- 
ing eight pounds requires five hours' boiling. Be- 
fore sending to the table, the bone should be taken 
out, and the beef pressed half an hour. If done 
so, it looks much nicer, and cuts better. 

EDGE-BONE OF BEEF, 

Weighing ten pounds, should be boiled threo 
hours, as this piece should be a little rare. 

MINCED CORNED BEEP. 

Chop some corned beef, fat and lean together, 
very fine, and as much potato ; mix them together ; 
put them into a fiying-pan with a good-sized piece 
of butter, and a little pepper ; stir it frequently until

beefy and sew it np tight ; flonr a cloth ; pin the 
beef np very tight in it ; boil it five or six hours. 
When it is done take the cloth off, and press it 
until it is cold. This is to be cut in thin slices, and 
eaten cold. 

SALTPETBZa) TONQUB 

Requires five or six hours to boil. When done 
lay it into cold water three minutes ; peel off the 
sbn, beginning at the tip end of the tongue, as it 
comos off much easier.

fiying-pan some bntter, pepper, and salt ; dredge in 
a little flour, half a pint of hot water, and the kid- 
neys ; let them simmer twenty minutes ; stir them 
often ; do not let them fry, because it hardens them. 
This is a very nice dish for breakfaet. 

TRIPE. 

The honey-comb part is the best; it should be 
well boiled. Cut it in square pieces of about six 
inches ; wash it in salt and water ; wipe it dry ; dip 
it in eggs and crums, or batter, and fry it in hot 
fat. Serve it with oyster sauce. After dishing the 
tripe, turn a quart of oyster sauce over it, 

ANOTHER TRIPE. 

Be sure the tripe is well boiled, that is, very ten- 
der ; if not, boil it until it is so ; then cut it in 
pieces about four inches square; let it be quite 
cold ; roll the pieces comerwise ; tie them with a 
thread ; dredge them with a little salt and mace ; 
roll them in egg and crums; fry in fat a nice 
brown ; serve with a gravy of drawn butter, with a 
little lemon and tomato catsup boiled in. 

ROAST LEG OP MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton weighing ten pounds should be 
roasted two hours. When half done turn the fat 
out of the roaster; then baste the meat with 
the drippings. Make the gravy the same as for 



heajB. 63 

roast beef^ or add a few spoonfiils of carrant 
jcUj and a cup of red wine. Ten minutes more 
should be allowed for every extra pound of mutton. 

BOAST SADDLE OF HUTTOK. 

A saddle of mntton, weighing eight pounds, 
requires three quarters of an hour to cook. The 
gravy is made the same as for a leg of mutton. 

A SHOULDER OF MUTTON, 

Weighing six pounds, requires one hour to roast; 
if stuffed, half an hour longer. Before cooking it, 
take out the bone, and fill the space with a dressing 
of bread-crums, pepper, salt, sweet marjoram^ one 
egg, cond a small piece of butter. 

TEG OF MUTTON BOILED. 

A leg of mutton, weighing ten pounds, requires 
an hour and a half to boil. Flour a cloth, tie the 
meat in it very tight, en^ put it into boiling water ; 
when done, put it into a pan, and turn cold water 
over it, and let it remain two minutes before remov- 
ing the cloth; this makes the mutton look very 
white. 

A SHOULDER OF MUTTON BOILED 

Is cooked in the same way as a leg, except that it 
takes half an hour less time to boil.

Take a cold leg of boiled mutton, or a small one 
not boiled, and put it into a saucepan that covers 
close ; cut into dice form two carrots, two turnips, 
and two onions ; put them around or under the mut* 
ton; add eight or ten cloves, pepper, salt, and water 
enough to cover the mutton ; simmer it four hours« 
About half an hour before dishing, add a cup of 
white wine, and two teaspoonfuls of soy. The water 
will waste away, leaving enough to make the gravy. 
After taking out the meat, skim off all the fat you 
can before making the gravy; dish the mutton; stir 
a little flour into the gravy, give it one boil, and 
then turn the vegetables and gravy over the meat. 

MUTTON CHOPS,

Beason them with pepper, salt, and a little butter. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Lay the mutton chops into a pan; dredge a little 
flour over them ; put them into the oven, with the 
door half open. They require about fifteen minutes 
to cook. Have prepared a hot dish ; after you dish 
the chops, dredge a little flour into your gravy, with 
a few spoonfuls of hot water, tomato catsup, pepper 
aad salt ; give it one boil, and turn it over the chops.

trim off the thin fat ; rub them over with yolk of 
egg and bread-crums; broil or fry them. Serve with 
gravy as for other chops. 

MINCE MUTTON. 

Chop the mutton very fine ; put it into a frying- 
pan, with some of the gravy, if you have it; if not, 
put in a little soup stock, just enough to moisten it,

and sweet marjoram, a piece of butter the size of 
an egg, or a little fat pork chopped very fine, and 
one egg ; mix this up well ; skewer the veal tight, 
to keep the dressing in. It adds to the look and 
taste of a fillet of veal to lard it with pork ; if this 
is not done, it should be basted often with butter. 
A piece weighing eight pounds requires four hours 
to roast. 

m 

A LOIN OP VEAL 

Is very nice, roasted plain. It is, however, very 
palatable cooked the same as a fillet of veal, by 
taking out the kidneys, and putting dressing in tJieir 
place. It requires three hours if roasted plain, and

of the above dishes chopped fine, and a little mace ; 
let it boil one hour, add half a tumblerful of red 
wine, and give it one boil ; cut a lemon and two 
hard-boiled eggs in pieces, place them in the bottom 
of the tareen, and pour the soup on to them. 

BOAST LAMB. 

The fore quarter is much the best piece to roast. 
It should be roasted about one hour and a half, and 
frequently basted. To make the gravy, take all the 
dripping from the tin roaster, add a very little water, 
a little salt and flour, and give it one boil. 

MINT SAUCE, 

To serve with roast lamb. Take a bunch of green 
mint, and chop it very fine with a knife ; add a tea- 
cup of fine brown sugar, and a teacup of sharp 
vinegar. Stir this up, and send it to the table in a 
sauce-boat. 

A BOILED LEG OF LAMB.

BOAST TENISON. 

A leg of venison weighing fourteen pounds should 
be roasted one hour if eaten on blazers ; if on hot 
plates, two hours. The dry skin should be taken off 
before roasting, with the fingers, not with a knife. 
The spit should be turned very often. When half 
done, it should be basted with flour, butter, and red 
wine, very frequently, until done. To make the 
gravy, take the shank of the venison, crack the bone, 
a pound of juicy beef, an onion stuck full of cloves, 
a little pepper and salt. Put it into a saucepan with 
two quarts of water, and boil it gently three hours. 
Strain this, and add to it the drippings from the 
venison, with nearly a quarter of a pound of butter; 
braid in two table-spoonfuls of flour, a teacup of red 
wine, and a teacup of currant jelly. Stir it all up, 
and let it boil about five minutes. 

A SADDLE OF VENISON. 

A saddle of venison is much the best piece of the 
deer. It requires but half the time to roast this 
that it does the leg, for it is a much thinner piece. 
Dressed in the same manner as the leg. 

A VENISON STEAK. 

Cut steaks from the leg half an inch thick, broil 
them about five minutes ; season with pepper, salt, 
and butter. If you have it, a cup of the roast veni- 
son gravy, very hot, is very nice poured over it ; or 
half a cup of red 'wine, and half a cup of currant

jelly, thickened with a little flour ar d butter, boiled 
up and turned over the steak. It should be served 
very hot. 

VENISON PIE. 

Take the breast and neck of venison, and cut them 
into small pieces. Season with pepper, salt, and a 
little ground cloves, and dredge it well with flour ; 
put it into the pie-dish as close as possible, fill up 
the dish with some of the roast venison gravy, or 
gravy prepared in the same manner, and cover the 
dish with a nice crust. Bake it half an hoMT. 

ROAST PIG. 

Make a dressing of bread-crums, a little salt, pep- 
per, sage, sweet marjoram, an onion chopped fine, 
butter, two eggs, and a little salt pork, and fry this 
a little ; when cold, stuff" the pig, sew it up, and then 
wash it in salt and water ; baste it often. A pig 
weighing nine pounds requires four hours to roast 

A SPAREBIB OB CHINE OF POBE

Tilth a little pepper, salt, and fine sage. Take all 
the fat out of the roaster when about half done, and 
then with the dripping make the gravy.

pig's head cheese. 

Boil a pig's head until the bone comes out, and 
chop this very fine; pound about eight soft crackers 
very fine, and mix this up well ; add some sweet 
herbs, pepper, scJt, and spices. Put this into a 
mould, and press it for two or three days. It is 
very nice cut into thin slices, and eaten cold. 

ROAST HAM. 

Spit a ham ; set it before a moderate fire to roast 
about two hours, turning the spit frequently ; then 
take it up 6n to a dish, peel off the rind, scrape all 
the fat out of the roaster, put it to the fire to roast 
again about two hours more ; basting it frequently 
in the same way as for beef. To make the gravy; 
put the dripping from the roaster into a saucepan, 
add a cup of water, a little flour, and give it one 
boil. Served in a sauce-tureen. 

A roasted ham is far superior to a boiled one.

BOILED HAH. 

A ham should be put into cold water enough to 
more than cover it, and boiled gently. A ham 
weighing fifteen pounds requires five hours' boiling. 
When about half done, and a part of the water has 
boiled away, add, if approved, a bottle of cham- 
pagne, or a pint of good white wine vinegar ; cover 
the pot close, to keep the flavor of the wine. 

An old ham should be laid in cold water over 
night. 

BOILED LEG OP CORNED PORK.

ROAST TURKEY. 



A TURKET Aould be well singed and cleaned ol 
pin-feathers • then draw the inwards. Be sure you 
take everything out that is inside. Lay the turkey 
into cold water ; clean the gizzards, liver, heart, and

neck; let all soak one hour if you have time. Wash 
a!l very clean, wipe the turkey very dry, inside and 
out. Make a dressing of two cups of bread-crums, 
one teaspoonful of salt, two large spoonfuls of 
sweet marjoram, two spoonfuls of butter, one egg, 
and mix them well together. Cut the skin of the 
turkey in the back part of the neck, that the breast 
may look plump ; fill the breast with the forcemeat, 
and sew it up. If you have any more forcemeat 
than is required for the breast, put the remainder 
into the body, and skewer the vent ; tie the legs 
down very tight, skewer the wings down to the 
sides, and turn the neck on to the back with a 
strong skewer. Baste with salt and water once,^ 
then frequently with butter ; fifteen minutes before 
dishing, dredge with a little salt and fiour, and baste 
with butter for the last time. This will give a fine 
frothy appearance, and add to the flavor of the tur- 
key. 

To make the gravy, put the gizzard, neck, and 
Kver, into a saucepan with a quart of water, a little 
pepper, salt, and mace ; put it on the fire, and let it 
boil to about a half pint. When done, braid up the 
liver very fine with a knife, and put it back into the 
water it has boiled in ; then add the drippings of 
the turkey and a little flour, and give it one boil, 
stirring it all the time. Dish the gizzard with the 
turkey. Allow twelve minutes to a pound for the 
time to roast a turkey.

the dressing. Put in the pork chopped very fine, 
instead of butter. In trussing, turn the wings on 
the back, instead of the sides, as for roasting; flour 
a cloth well ; pin up the turkey tight ; put it into 
boiling water where one or two pounds of salt pork 
have been boiling some time ; let this boil with the 
turkey. Dish the pork with the turkey on a sepa- 
rate dish, with some parsley. Serve with oyster or 
eelery sauce. 

A turkey weighing eight pounds requires an hour 
and a half to boil. 

BOAST CHICKENS. 

Dress and roast the same as a turkey. A pair of 
chickens weighing six pounds require an hour and 
a half to roast. Make the gravy the same as for a 
turkey, except the mace, which is to be omitted. 

BOILED CHICKENS. 

Dressed and boiled the same as a turkey. Some 
cooks do not stuff boiled chickens or turkeys ; but 
the dressing adds as much to the boiled as to the 
roast. Pork boiled with chickens is very necessary 
A pair of chickens require from one to two hourf 
to boil, depending upon the size and age.

CHICKEN OB TUBKET STEWED WITH CELEBT. 

Take a yearling hen-turkey, prepare as for boiling, 
place it in a large saucepan or small soup-pot. Cut 
up a largo head of celery in inch pieces, and one 
onion very fine ; put this, with white pepper, salt^ 
and a large teaspoonful of mace, all round the 
turkey, just cover it with hot water, and let it come 
to a boil; set it a little off the fire, and let it simmer 
two or three hours, depending on the size. Dish 
the turkey; cover it to keep hot while you are 
preparing the gravy. Braid together half a pound 
of butter and two table-spoonfuls of flour, put it 
into the saucepan with the gravy ; add a cup of 
cream, give it one boil ; turn the whole over the 
turkey. Gramish with sprigs of curled parsley. 

Chickens may be dressed in the same way. 

TO BONE AND COOK A BONED TUBKEY. 

Clean the turkey well, lay it on the table, have a 
small, sharp-pointed knife ; begin at the wing, pass 
the knife close to the bone, cut the flesh from the 
bone, and keep the skin as whole as possible ; then 
pass the knife on each side of the breast, and then 
around the legs ; split the back about half way up, 
and draw but the bones. Have ready a stuffing 
made of the meat of a chicken chopped very fine, 
bread-crums, peppe^ salt, mace, sweet marjoram, a 
piece of butter, and two eggs, all well mixed up. 
Fill the turkey, and sew it up, preserving the form.

bones that have been taken out of the turkey put 
into a deep saucepan, with one onion and one carrot 
cut very fine, mace, pepper, salt, and a few cloves. 
Lay the turkey on the bones, and add two quarts of 
water ; cover it tight, and let it simmer three hours ; 
then take out the turkey, flour it, baste it well 
with butter, and set it in the oven to brown. If 
there is not one quart of gravy, add more water, 
and let it boil half an hour. Beat up the whites 
and shells of two eggs, and stir into the gravy, and 
let it boil fifteen minutes ; strain it through a cloth 
into a jelly-mould. When the turkey is cold, and 
the jelly hard, disli the turkey with the jelly on 
the breast, or cut it small, and serve round the 
turkey. 
This is considered a very nice supper dish. 

HASH TURKEY OB CHICKENS.

AS the mongrel has so much flavor, the dressing is 
unnecessary. Without dressing, an hour and a ^df 
will roast a large-sized goose. 

WILD GOOSE. 

A wild goose should be roasted rare ; one hour's 
roasting is sufficient. Add a glass of red wine and 
half a cup of currant jelly to the gravy, which is 
made the same as for the common goose. Boil it 
together, and send it to the table in a sauce-tureen.

ing ; lay five or six slices of salt pork in the bottom 
of the pot ; chop an onion very fine, and fry it in 
the fat to a nice brown ; then put the pigeons into 
the pot quite close, with a little pepper and salt, 
and shake in a little flour ; turn in hot water, or 
brown stock enough to quite cover over the pig-

and bake it about three quarters of an hour, until 
the crust is done. 

PREPARING AND COOKING SMALL BIRDS. 

Some cooks do not take out the entrails of small 
birds ; but the flavor is much nicer to draw all out, 
excepting the heart and liver. This may be done 
by making a small opening in the vent, and drawing 
very carefully. Wild birds should not lie in cold 
water to soak, but should be washed quickly and 
wiped dry. 

QUAILS. 

Tie the legs down to the rump with a strong 
thread, letting the feet be up. Dredge them with 
a little flour, baste them with butter, and roast them

Have any kind of birds prepared the same as a 
turkey, stuflFed and stewed or roasted. Place the 
birds in a mould that will just hold them, breast 
downwards, with the legs down and tied together ; 
prepare the jelly as above. Fill the mould quite 
full ; set it to cool till the next day ; then turn it 
on to the dish, breast up. 

If the jelly is clear this is very handsome for a 
side-dish at dinner, or for a supper table, with the 
colored jelly cut fine and sprinkled round the dish« 
with a little curled parsley.

it with a little butter and salt ; form the rice round 
the dish about three or four inches high, rub it 
over with the yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven 
to brown. When it is done, turn the hash into the 
middle of the dish. This makes a very handsome 
finish to a dish. 

Rice prepared in this way, spread over a pie 
made of cold meat, for the crust, an inch thick, and 
browned, is nice. 

POTATO CRUST OR EDGING. 

Boil one dozen good potatoes, and mash them 
w«ll. Add a piece of butter, a little salt, and half a

The coflfee should be dried in the oven with the 
door open one or two hours before roasting. When 
it is ready to roast, set it on the fire in an iron pan, 
and stir it constantly until it becomes a light brown. 
To two pounds of coflfee add a bit of butter about 
the size of a walnut three minutes before taking it 
from the fire. Coflfee is much better when it is 
roasted, ground, and made within one hour. One 
cup of ground coflfee will make one quart of coflfee. 
To make coflfee in a biggii* put the ground coflfee 
into the filter, wet it with cold water, and let it stand 
five minutes to swell. Put the flilter into the pot 
where it belongs ; fill it up with boiling water, and 
set where it will keep hot, but not boil. When this 
has run through, add water until you have made a 
quart of coflfee. It does not require more than ten 
minutes to make good coflfee.

ground coflfee, and stir in one egg, or a piece of salt 
fish-skin two inches square ; add one quart of water. 
Boil it ten minutes, take it oflf, turn a cupful out at

then roll it out thin again ; roll out the other cake 
of butter, lay it on the paste, dredge on a little more 
flour, and roll it up again. Gut it into as many 
pieces as required. For edging, roll out a piece as 
long as will go around the plate without piecing, as 
it looks much better. The edging should be three 
or four layers of paste rolled very thin, and put on 
the rim of the plate. Use sifted flour to dredge on 
the paste-board, and to roll the butter and paste 
together. This flour is included in the weight of 
the flour for the paste.

one half. 

DIRECTIOKS FOB FBEEZIN6 ICE CBEAMS, WATEB 

ICES, ETC. 

Break the ice in small pieces, — say about the 
size of an egg, or smaller, — and pat some in the 
bottom of a tub ; set the kettle in ; then put in 
about a quart of coarse rock salt ; then two quarts 
of ice ; and so on until the tub is filled up to the 
top of the kettle. Stir it until the cream is frozen. 
In the old-fashioned freezer you must take off the 
cover frequently, and scrape off the cream from the 
sides until it freezes evenly. 

If it is to be put into moulds, fill them quite frill, 
shut them very tight, and put them in the ice and 
salt, covering them entirely ; then throw over a 
piece of carpet to keep the air out. To take them 
out of the mould, have your dish ready, wipe the 
mould, and then turn over it some boiling water, 
wiping it again very quickly ; then turn it on ihe 
dish. Remove the mould very slowly, for fear of 
breaking. When pure essences can be procured, 
they are quite equal to fresh fruits to flavor with. 

N. B. — Good and pure essences and sirups may 
be obtained at Messrs. Smith & Melvin's, at 325 
Washington-street, Boston, who manufacture the 
above-named articles expressly for retailing, and

178 BECEIPTS. 

sugar to a pound of quinces; put the peels and corei 
into a kettle with just water enough to cover thenu 
Let this simmer about two hours ; then strain the 
liquor, put it back into the kettle, and put in as 
many quinces as the liquor will cover; boil them 
until they are tender, take them out, and put them 
on a flat dish to cool; put in more, until all are 
boiled, then put the sugar in, and let it boil until it 
becomes a sirup ; then put in as many quinces as 
ihe sirup will cover; let them boil about thirty 
minutes; put them on a flat dish to cool; and then 
more, until they are all boiled ; then boil the sirup

Wtigh to a pound of peaches a pound of sugar ; 
put the peaches into a preserving-kettlOj and turn 
on boiling water enough to just cover them, and let 
them boil ten minutes. Take them out carefully on 
a flat dish to cool, then peel them with your fingers, 
to keep the shape ; take a little of the water that 
they were boiled in, add the sugar, and let it boil 
until it becomes a sirup. Put in a few peaches at 
a time, so as not to crowd them ; when they are 
done, put them on a dish to cool. Lay them carei 
fully into a jar, boil the sirup a few minutes after 
the peaches are done, and strain it hot over the 
peaches. 

ANOTHEB MODE.

then when they are cold put them into the jar ; 
strain the sirup hot through a fine sieve into the 
brandy, and then put it on the peaches. 

PLUMS. 

Cfreen Gages. — Take a pound of sugar to a pound 
of plums ; make a sirup of the sugar, with a little 
water, just enough to keep the sugar from burning ; 
put in a few plums at a time, boil them until they 
are tender, and take them out on a dish to cool. 
When all are done, put them into jars ; then boil the

APPLE JELLY. 

Take a dozen good tart apples, cat them into 
quarters, add a pint of water, and let them simmer 
about half an hour. Set a sieve over an earthen 
pan, turn the apples into it, and let them drain ; but 
do not stir the apples after the juice is drained out. 
Let it stand and settle about half an hour ; then 
take a pint of juice to a pound of white sugar, boil 
it ten minutes, and strain it into moulds or jars. 

The apple can^e seasoned, and used for apple 
sauce. 

APPLE MABMALADE 

Is made the same as the crab apple, except that 
the apples must be peeJed. 

BASPBEBBY JAM.

them together into the kettle, and boil it gently one 
hour, stirring it frequently. Put it up in jars, and 
let it stand about four days ; if in that time the 
sirup rises at the top, put it in the kettle, and boil 
it half an hour. 

BASPBEBBY OB BLAOKBEBBY JELLY. 

Stew the fruit, strain it through a sieve, measure 
a pint of juice to a pound of sugar, boil it twenty 
or thirty minutes, and then strain it through a very 
fine sieve into the jar while it is hot. Let them 
stand two or three days ; then do them up in the 
same manner as currant jelly. 



PRESERVES. 18S 

PRESERVED BARBERRIES AND SIRIH». 

One pound of sngar, one pound of barberries, one 
half pint of water ; put the sugar and water to boil , 
when boiled enough to skim, put in the barberries ; 
let them boil until the sirup is thick ; skim out the 
barberries into jars, with sirup enough to keep 
them. Strain the rest of the sirup through a cloth ; 
put it into bottles; cork and seal them. This makes 
a very nice drink with ice-water. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

The currants should be ripe, and fresh-picked. 
Put them into a preserving-kettle with a very little 
water, say about a cupful, to prevent them from 
burning. Let them stew gently until the currants 
turn white, then strain them through a sieve ; they 
will not require much squeezing. Take a pint of 
juice to a pound of sugar, put them into the kettle, 
and boil it thirty minutes. Take a spoonful out on 
a plate, and set the plate on ice; if it is done, it will 
stiffen in five minutes. Then strain it through a 
very fine sieve into small glass jars. Set them in 
the sun two days. Put a piece of paper wet with 
brandy on the top, and over this a bladder, and tie 
them up. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Pill a stone jar with fresh-picked ripe currants ; 
set it in a kettle of cold water ; let the watei 
boil until the currants look wh^te, then straiij 



184 RECEIPTS. 

the juice from tham through a towel To a pint of 
juice put a pound of crushed sugar; stir it while 
dissolving ; when it gets to a boil, let it boil fifteen 
minutes; strain into small jars to cool; when cooled, 
secure it from the air. 

PRESERVED CITRON MELON. 

Peel the melon, take out the inside, and cut it in 
such pieces as you like — thin strips, about a quarter 
of an inch thick, I think are the best. Then weigh 
the melon, and take the same weight in fine white 
sugar ; put a little alum in some water, and boil the 
melon in it until it is tender ; take it up on a dish, 
sprinkle the sugar over it, and between the pieces, 
and let it stand over night. Then turn off the 
sirup into the preserving-kettle, and boil until 
clarified ; then put the melon in, and boil it until 
scalded through; take it out on a dish to cool. 
Add to the sirup two lemons and a little preserved 
ginger, to flavor it ; boil the sirup again, until quite 
clear; put the melon up into jars, turn the sirup over 
it, not quite boiling hot ; when cold, seal up your 
jars as for other preserves. 

PINEAPPLE. 

Peel the pineapple, and cut it in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; take a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit; sprinkle the sugar over the apple, 
and let it stand until the next day. Then put it 
into the kettle, and boil it until the apple looks clear. 



PBESEBYES. 18o 

Take out the apple to cool ; give the simp one boil^ 
and then strain it throngh a hair sieve on the fruit. 

PINEAPPLE JAK. 

Peel the apple and weigh it — a pound to a pound 
of sugar ; grate the apple on a coarse grater ; put 
the apple and sugar in the kettle together, and let 
it boil thirty or forty minutes. 

STBAWBEBBIES. 

Weign one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; 
put the sugar into the kettle with just water enough 
to prevent its burning ; boil to a sirup ; then put in 
as many strawberries at a time as will cover the top 
of the sirup without crowding them, and let them 
boil twenty minutes. Take them out carefully, so 
as not to break them, and put them in a dish to cool 
separately. When cold, put them into glass jars, 
and strain the hot sirup through a hair sieve on to 
them. 

The Hovey Seedlings are the best to preserve in 
this manner, as they are very large. If, however, 
they get broken, it would be better to put them 
back into the kettle, and boil them thirty minutes 
for jam. 

ANOTHEB WAY TO PRESEBVE STBAWBEBBIES. 

Weigh a pound of fine loaf sugar to a pound of 
fruit ; sprinkle the sugar over the fruit, and let it 
stand over night. The next day, strain oflf the sirup 

16*

and boil it about ten minutes ; then put in tho frait^ 
and let it boil gently twenty minutes more. Skim 
out the fruit on a flat dish to cool. When cool, pui 
them in jars ; add the sirup, and tie them up tight, 
with paper dipped in brandy, and a bladder over it 

CODDLED APPLES. 

Feel the apples, leaving the stems on, and put as 
many as will stand into the preserving-kettle or 
saucepan ; put in a little water, and let them boil 
until they are tender; take them out carefully; 
allow a cup of sugar to three apples ; put it into the 
water that they were boiled in, and boil it ten min- 
utes. Peel a lemon very thin, in very narrow strips; 
lay them around the stem of the apple ; put them 
into the sirup, and boil them until they are clear. 
Put them into the dish in which you send them to 
the table, and pour the sirup on them. These will 
not keep more than three or four days. 

PEABS. 

Peel the pears, boil them in water until they 
are quite tender, and then take them out on a dish 
to cool. Make a sirup of white sugar. A few 
pieces of ginger and a slice of lemon make a nice 
flavor to the sirup. Put in the pears, and boil them 
gently until they are quite clear ; the time depends 
on the size ; if they are small they require about 
thirty minutes. If to keep all winter, allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit

STEWED PEABS. 

Take large honeyed pears, and peel, core, and 
quarter them. Take two qnarts of the pears, a pint* 
bowl of sugar, a pint of water, and put all this into 
a preserving-kettle or saucepan. Cover it tight

long while, to get off all the fat. 

BEEF JUICE FOB THE SICE. 

Cut one pound of beef into small pieces, put it 
into a bottle and cork it up ; set the bottle into a 
kettle of cold water ; let it stand over the fire until 
the water boils, and longer if the juice is not all out 
of the beef. This is for invalids who can take but 
little liquid at a time, therefore cannot take beef tea. 

ANOTHEB BEEF JUICE. 

Take about a pound of rump of beef; lay it on the 
gridiron ; let it just warm through ; sprinkle a little 
salt over it ; cut it in pieces about the size of half a

INTRODUCTION. 



It is about nine years since I published my last 
book of Receipts for Cooking. Since that time, I 
have been constantly engaged in providing for a 
large, and sometimes for a small, family ; therefore 
I have had opportunity to improve, as practice 
makes perfect in every profession. 

I do not presume to say that I have perfected my 
knowledge ; but nine years have given me so much 
more experience, that I am induced to make addi- 
tions to my book of many receipts that I think will 
be very useful ; and as provisions of all kinds are so 
expensive, all housekeepers are glad to receive any 
suggestions of economy. 

If a lady is convhiced that she can, by her own 
attention to. her housekeeping, make her expenses 
much less and home more comfortable, I think she 
would take as much pride in her well-ordered house- 
hold, 'and well-cooked dishes, as her great-grand- 
mother did of old. It is not .necessary that a lady 
should give up any of her real accomplishments, as 
an educated, refined lady, to attend to her house- 
keeping, for the first requisite is economy of time as 
well as money ; every hour of her day may be spent 

17 ♦ (W7) 



198 INTBODUCTION. 

with profit to herself and to others, thereby receiv* 
ing much, and giving much, pleasure. 

When a young ladj allows herself to be placed at 
the head of her husband's establishment, she is ex- 
pected to preside with dignity and propriety. Is it 
not necessary that she should be capable of directing 
understandingly her household ? To be able to di- 
rect well is necessary, if she expects her orders well 
executed. 

Young people have the idea that they do not wish 
to be troubled with their cooking, therefore they do 
not care to know much about the matter. Tliis is a 
mistaken notion. It is not necessaiy that a lady, to 
have her cooking well done, must with her own 
hands do it. 

I provide, and have a large dinner to attend to, 
every day, but I do not cook it. If I was obliged to 
do so, I should think myself a poor director of my 
business. But it is absolutely necessary that I 
should know how everything in my house is to be 
done, from the cleaning of a knife to the best cooked 
dinner I have served. 

If I should be so situated that I felt it necessary, I 
could go into my kitchen and cook a dinner ; and I 
think that we should have better cooks, and be* bet- 
ter served, if every lady*knew enough of housekeep- 
ing duty to be thus far independent. 

We all know that much of the happiness of a 
family depends on good food, well cooked, and well 
served. Here is another necessity for economy of 



IMTBODlTCnON. . 199 

time — punctuality. If jour time is set for yoni 
meals, you expect jour cook to be punctual, and to 
serve her meeis hot. That jou cannot have, unless 
you are ready yourself to receive them — for if they 
must be kept hot by standing in the oven or on hot 
plates, the dinner will be spoiled — you waste your 
own time, and your servant's too. 

Negligence is very easily learned if you are not 
punctual. Your servants soon learn to think, 
^^ Well, mistress will not be ready ; therefore it is no 
great matter if I am a little late." A half hour late 
here and there soon absorbs our time, which is 
valuable, and whose is not ? 

It is under these impressions that I have set my- 
self to the work of helping the young housekeeper to 
please herself and husband, by her ready use of the 
advice that I have, or can give her.

ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS 

These receipts I give for a small family, for it is 
almost impossible to cook little enough for two with« 
out waste, and I think most people like made dishes 
if well made, and that cannot be without the atten« 
tion of mistress and cook, for made dishes require 
more judgment and attention than a fresh cooked 
joint of meat, although I think all cooking requires 
care. 

A very common fault is, that there is not at- 
tention enough paid to this branch of housekeeping. 
In almost all families the cook is required to take 
a part, and often a large part, of the washing and 
ironing; therefore she will either not do this well, 
or neglect the cooking. A cook who likes her busi- 
ness, and consequently does it well, does not like 
washing and ironing; therefore, if a cook must 
wash, it is best to have a simple dinner on that day, 
and a cold dessert, giving as little cooking as possi- 
ble, if you want both done well. 

BOUILLI BEEF. 

A piece of the round, or shoulder of mutton piece, 
or a part of the face of the rump, makes a very nice 
bouilli. 

Take eight or ten pounds of beef ; put it to boil 
six or eight hours in six quarts of water, with two 



202 ECONOMICAL BECBIPTS. 

onions, two carrots, one dozen cloves, salt, and pep- 
per. Take up the beef; set it away until the next 
day; straia the liquor into the soupjar; the next 
day set on the fire a saucepan that will about hold 
the beef; cut two onions fine, fry them in a little 
butter, dredge in some flour to brown, lay in the 
beef; have ready two carrots, two turnips, two 
onions, a little celery, one leek, all cut in small dice 
form ; lay them round the beef ; then add enough 
of the stock it was boiled in to just cover it. Let it 
cook slowly two hours and a half. Dish the meat ; 
add to the gravy one table-spoonful of mixed mustard, 
one of soy, and a little flour if it has not consistency 
enough ; ^ve it one boil ; turn over the meat the 
vegetables and gravy ; chop fine two pickled cucum- 
bers, and sprinkle them over the top of the meat. 
The water the beef was boiled in may be served as a 
clear beef soup. 
What is left of the bouilli makes a nice 

BEEF PIE. 

Cut the beef in slices ; cut in very thin slices one 
onion ; lay this in the bottom of the pie-dish ; then a 
layer of beef; dredge in a little flour ; then a layer 
df beef, and onion, pepper, salt, and flour, and beef, 
until the dish is full : then add the cold gravy ; if 
not enough, a little stock or water ; scald and peel 
as many tomatoes as will cover the dish ; lay them 
on, pepper, salt, and bread crumbs, a few bits of but- 
ter ; set it into the oven to brown. By the time the 



i 



ECONOMICAL RBCEIFT8. 208 

tomatoes are cooked, the meat is hot. This is a 
very nice dish. 

MUTTON PIB. 

If you have a leg of mutton boiled for dinner, set 
the water away until the next morning ; and also 
the dish that the mutton was served in, just as it 
comes from the table. 

Gut all the mutton from the bone that you will 
use for broth ; cut the mutton in not very thin 
pieces ; cut up an onion ; chop a little parsley. Lay 
into a pie-dish a layer of meat seasoned with a little 
onion (if you like, the onion may be omitted), a little 
parsley, pepper, and salt, and a little of the cold 
drawn butter and dish gravy that was left ; another 
layer of meat and seasoning as before, and so oi^ 
until the dish is nearly full. Have tomatoes enough 
peeled to cover the dish ; sprinkle over some pepper 
and salt; cover all with bread crumbs, and a fe^ 
little bits of butter. Set it into the oven. By the 
time the tomatoes are warm, the mutton is hot. 
This dish saves your cold mutton, and is very nice. 

MUTTON BBOTH. 

Set away the water that the mutton was boiled in, 
in a stone jar, or some kind of earthen dish ; the 
next day take off all the fat ; put the broth into the 
Boup pot, with the bones of the mutton cracked up, 
two onions, two carrots, two turnips, cut small ; let 
|t boil one or two hours ; with a skimmer take out 



204 ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 

the bones ; add half of a large cup of rice ; some 
salt. Let it boil one hour, and you will have a very 
good mutton broth. 

BEEF PIE. 

Cold roast beef (from the bone to* be used for 
soup), cut in not very thin pieces; slice an onion, 
fry it in a little beef drippings ; add a little flour to 
brown; lay this into a pie-dish; then the beef; 
season with pepper and salt ; a few slices of toma- 
io, if you like ; all the beef juice that was left in 
the dish ; as much of the gravy as will nearly fill the 
dish ; add a little water, or beef stock if you have it. 
Boil eight or ten potatoes ; mash them fine ; add a 
little salt, half a cup of cream or butter ; stir this up 
light ; spread it over the pie-dish an inch and a haUT 
thick ; brush it over with a paste brush dipped in a 
beaten egg. Set it into the oven for half an hour 
to brown. 

CHICKEN BBOTH. 

The water chicken was boiled in, set away in a 
cool place, makes a good broth. The next day skim 
off the fat ; take the bones of the chicken ; put into 
the soup-pot with the broth, one onion cut very fine, 
one carrot, one turnip, a small bunch of parsley, a 
little salt, and pepper ; let boil two hours ; with a 
skimmer take out the bones; add a half cup of 
vermicelli ; let boil one hour ; you will have a nice 
chicken broth. 

Take off all the meat you can from the bones. To 



ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS* 205 

make any of these little dishes requires but very lit- 
tle meat. 

CfflCKEN PATES. 

Gold chicken chopped fine makes a nice chicken 
salad ; but if you have not enough for that, season 
the chicken with a very little mace, pepper, salt, 
half a cup of cream ; put it into a saucepan ; let it 
get hot. Have ready a nice paste ; line a few patty- 
pans with it, and bake them ; then fill them with the 
hot chicken. Slip them out of the pans on to a 
small dish. Half a dozen p&tds make a pretty dish. 
All these little things saved help a dinner. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Made of cold roast, or boiled chicken. Skin the 
chicken ; cut it in nice pieces ; lay these in a pie* 
dish ; if you have any of the cold gravy put that in, 
if not, put the chicken bones into a saucepan with 
as much water as you want of gravy ; season with 
pepper, salt, and a very little mace ; boil this until 
all the strength is out of the bones ; put it into the 
dish; cover it with a good paste. Bake it about 
half an hour. 

FRICASSEE OF COLD CHICKEN. 

Skin the breast of the chicken ; cut the rest in 
nice pieces ; lay the breast into the saucepan, with 
the other pieces round it ; dredge in a little flour, 
pepper, salt, mace ; a piece of butter the size of an 

18 



206 . ECONOMICAL BECEIPTS. 

egg, braided with a spoonful of flour, half pint of 
cream or good milk, and half a gill of white stock 
or water ; let it simmer about twenty minutes. 
Dish the breast in the middle, place the other pieceis 
round it, and turn on the gravy. 

YEAL. 

I have it from one of our first physicians, that this 
is not unwholesome when well cooked. This meat 
can be made into many little side dishes. A leg of 
Teal makes a part of four dinners. The shin a soup, 
the next cut a fillet, two slices cut from the round a 
cutlet. The meat that you can take off the shin 
that is boiled for soup, will make as nice a salad as 
chicken, for it is boiled very tender. Chop it very 
fine, and dress it the same as chicken, and many 
would scarcely know the difference. What is left 
of the fillet makes nice croquettes. Or chop it very 
fine, put it into a frying-pan with the cold gravy, and 
let it get very hot, but not fry ; serve it on toast, or 
with toast cut in three-cornered pieces, and set up 
roimd the dish. If you have no gravy, add a piece 
of butter, pepper, salt, and a very little .hot water ; 
Btir it well ; be sure not to let it fry, for that would 
spoil it. 

COLD LOm OP VEAL. 

Cold loin of veal makes the best mince, because it 
has more fat, and is, consequently, less dry than the 
leg. A little of the mince veal makes nice p&t£s as 
chicken in paste. 



ECONOMICAL SBCfilPlS. 207 

ANOTHER TEAL CROQUETTE. 

Chop the veal very fine ; add half as much bread- 
crumbs as veal ; season with mace, pepper, and salt ; 
add one raw egg; roll thin in pieces about three 
inches long ; dip them in egg and crumbs ; fry in 
hot fat. Served in a small flat dish, dressed with 
parsley. 

STEWED BREAST OF VEAL. 

Lay a nice breast of veal in a baking-pan ; turn 
over it one quart of water ; set it into the oven to 
stew about two hours ; then baste it with butter, and 
brown it. Make the gravy with what remains of the 
water it was stewed in ; dredge in a little flour, pep* 
per, salt, a small piece of butter ; give it one boil ; 
send to the table in a gravy-dish. 

VEAL TOT-PIE. 

Take a scrag and knuckle of veal ; fry a few slices 
of pork in the soup-pot ; cut the veal and knuckle in 
small pieces, and put it into the pot ; add pepper 
and salt ; just cover the meat with cold water ; let 
it boil two or three hours ; add six or eight small 
potatoes ; if not seasoned enough, add more pepper 
or salt. Have a nice raised dough ; roll it about 
half an inch thick ; cut it in pieces, and cover the 
meat. Cover the pot tight, and let it stew half an 
hour. When dishing, lay the crust round the dish ; 
put the meat and potatoes in the middle. This is a 
very homely dish, but good and cheap. 



208 ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 

STUFFED LOAF. 

Mince what is left of a leg of veal ; mix with it 
pepper, salt, a little mace, and a little onion if pre- 
ferred. Take a stale baker's loaf (an outside one is 
preferable, as it has more crust) ; cut a hole about 
three inches square in the bottom of it, and scoop 
out all the soft (this can be saved for a bread-pud- 
ding) ; then, after heating the mince in the spider, 
fill the loaf with it ; replace the square piece of crust 
and tie it up ; then put the loaf into the spider in 
hot fat, and turn it over until the whole is a dark 
brown. Garnish the dish, and it will be a very at- 
tractive looking ornament for a table. 

YEAL LOAF. 

Three pounds uncooked veal; half pound salt 
pork chopped fine ; three eggs ; three teaspoonfuls 
of salt, two of pepper ; a handful of cut parsley, 
sweet herbs ; one cup of cracker-crumbs. Bake one 
hour and a half. Basting with butter. Cut in 
slices when cold. 

A SHIN OF BEEF. 

To make a very nice dish to cut cold for lunch, 
tea, or breakfast, with baked potatoes. Put a snin 
of beef to boil in eight quarts of water, with a table- 
spoonful of salt ; just before it comes to a boil skim 
it well ; let it boil all day ; if the water boils away, 
add more, but not too much — just enough to keep 



ECONOMICAL BECEIFTS. 209 

it from burning. When the meat is boiled to 
shreds, turn it out into a pan, that jou may take 
out everj little bit of bone ; put it back into the pot ; 
season it well with pepper, salt, cloves, allspice, and 
a little sweet herbs if you like ; let it simmer half 
an hour ; stir it up well ; turn it into a deep dish ; 
set it away. When it is cold it will be as hard as 
.cheese. Gut it in thin slices ; garnish the dish with 
parsley. This will keep on the ice in summer a 
week, and in winter a month. It is very nourishing, 
as it has all the substance of a shin of beef that 
would be used for two or three days for soup. 

GOLLALU. 

Half a peck of tomatoes ; quarter of a peck of 
ochra ; peel them, and put them on to stew with a 
slice of ham; stew them an hour; then add two 
pounds of hashed meat, and two onions ; season it 
highly with pepper and salt, and let it remain on 
the fire three or four hours. 

AN ENGUSH BOUND OF BEEF. 

Take the top part of a fine fat round of beef, 
weighing about fifteen pounds ; corn it for three or 
four days ; take it out of the pickle ; do not wash 
off all of the salt ; tie it round strong, to keep it in 
a perfect round shape when cooked ; put it to boil 
with not much more water than will cover it ; boil 
with it four carrots and six turnips ; let them boil 
moderately four hours. Serve with it the carrots 

18* 



210 BREAD-MAKING AND BAKING. 

cut lengthwise. Mash the turnips with a little salt 
and butter, a cabbage or^auliflower, and beets. For 
gravy, take three gills of good drawn butter, add one 
large table-spoonful of mixed mustard, one of soy, 
one of vinegar, or the juice of a lemon, or plain 
drawn butter, as you may choose. This is nice cold, 
sliced thin. 



ON BREAD-MAKING AND BAKING. 

As bread is one of the most essential articles of 
food, it is of great importance to have good bread, 
well baked, as a matter of health and economy as 
weU as pleasure. We cannot expect all this with- 
out care and attention. One must have good yeast, 
good flour, and willing, clean, strong hands. 

YEAST. 

This is the first requisite for good bread. You 
can buy yeast at the baker's or brewer's, but home- 
made is better than either. 

Take as many dry hops as you can grasp in your 
hand ; put them into a saucepan ; turn on two 
quarts of boiling water; set them on to boil. In 
another saucepan put eight or ten potatoes to boil ; 
when the potatoes are done, the hops will be boiled 
enough. Mash the potatoes fine ; add two table- 
spoonfuls of salt; strain the hop«water on to the 



BBEAD-MAKINQ AM) BAKINO. 211 

potatoes ; stir in as much flour as will make a thin 
batter ; let it stand to cool ; when cool enough to 
put your hand in, stir in one pint of good jeast, 
either baker's or brewer's ; set it to rise five or six 
hours, or until it is all of a foam ; then strain it 
through a cullender into a stone jug ; stop it tight ; 
keep it in a cool place. This will keep a week. It 
is best to make yeast while you have enough to rise 
a new jug full. 

MAKING DRY YEAST. 

In the country people are frequently troubled to 
get yeast to start with. This is a reliable receipt : 

Take one pound of good dry hops ; put them in a 
pailful of water ; let it boil one hour. Boil one peck 
of good potatoes ; mash them fine ; strain the water 
from the hops on to them ; add one teacup of salt ; 
stir in flour enough to make a thin batter ; let it 
stand to get cool. When cool enough to put your 
hand in, stir in one quart of good fresh yeast ; set it 
to rise six or eight hours ; when it is all of a froth, 
have ready very nice*sifted corn meal ; stir this in 
until it is thick enough to roll out ; roll this about 
a quarter of an inch thick ; cut it into squares about 
four inches. Lay a sheet doWn where the sun is very 
bright ; spread the cakes on it to dry ; turn them 
twice a day until perfectly dry, then pack them away. 
It takes two or three days to make a batch of dry 
yeast. When wanted for use, take a cake, put to it 
half a pint of lukewarm water, a table-spoonful of 



212 BEEAD-MAEING AND BAEINa. 

sugar, a teaspoonful of salt ; stir in flour enough to 
make a thin batter ; set it in a warm place until it 
rises. This will rise four quarts of flour. Mix the 
same as the other yeast bread. 

FOB MAKING LOAF BREAD. 

Sift the flour into a large dry pan ; always sift 
flour before using it, it is much lighter. It is best 
to have it ready before beginning any other prepara- 
tions. Put into a tin pan, or wooden one, two 
quarts of warm water, not hot ; stir in about a quart 
of flour ; stir this up with your hands ; add one cup 
of yeast, one table-spoonful of salt ; keep stirring or 
beating up the mixture ; add more flour, working it 
with both hands, until you get enough to make a 
smooth light dough. Cover it with a clean cloth ; 
set it to rise in a warm place over night. In the 
morning flour the bread-board, turn the dough on to 
it, and knead it well with both hands ; cut it into 
two or three loaves, and knead each one. Bub the 
bread-pans with a little butter ; put in the bread, 
and let it stand to rise thirty or forty minutes, or 
till you see it has risen ; put it into the oven to bake 
three quarters of an hour. When you take it out 
of the oven turn the louf over, and strike it with 
your knuckles ; if it makes a ringing sound, the 
bread is baked, if not, let it bake ten or fifteen 
minutes longer. If the crust seems to have baked 
too hard, take a clean towel, wring it out of cold 
water, roll the bread in it, and let it remain about 



BBEAIX-MAEINQ AND BAKING. 213 

fifteen minutes. It will cut better when the bread 
is cold. 

A little Indian meal in white loaf bread is very 
nice for a variety. Sift and scald, with boiling 
water, a quart of meal ; let it stand until cool ; mix 
this in with the flour. The bread requires a little 
more salt, and a little more baking, than when made 
all flour. 

I use butter to rub on my bread-pans, as any other 
fat might leave an unpleasant taste on the crust. A 
small piece of butter warmed in a saucer, and put 
on to the pans with a clean piece of cloth, is the best 
for buttering pans for baking bread and cake. 

BREAKFAST AND DINNER ROLLS. 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg ; put it 
into a pitcher, *and turn on a pint of boiling water ; 
stir it until the butter is melted ; then add one pint 
of cold milk. Turn this into the bread-pan ; add 
three pints of flour ; stir it up ; then half a cup of 
good yeast, half a cup of white sugar, one spoonful 
of salt ; stir this briskly ; keep adding flour, and 
beating it, till it is of good consistency, neither too 
hard nor too soft, but smooth and light to the hands. 
Cover it with a cloth (in winter put a piece of 
woollen cloth over the bread-cloth to keep it warm, 
that it may rise well). In the morning turn the 
dough on to the bread-board ; knead it well with 
both hands, and roll it out about an inch thick ; cut 
it in equal bits as large as you wish the rolls. Take 



214 BBEAD-MAKIKQ AND BAKINO. 

the bits between your hands, and roll them in long 
rolls of about six inches and two wide ; have the 
bread-pans rubbed with a little butter ; lay the rolls 
in, in even length and shape ; let them rise an hour, 
and bake twenty minutes. When you take the 
rolls from the oven — before you take them from 
the pan, and while they are hot — brush them over 
with a little butter. This adds very much to the 
appearance, making the rolls look smooth and glossy. 
These long rolls are nice for breakfast. For dinner 
make them shorter, about four inches in length, but 
the same width, or roll out the dough, and cut it 
with a common-sized biscuit-cutter ; baked the same 
as the rolls. 

DTSPEPSIA BREAD, WrTHOUT TEAST. 

Take a quart of Oraham flour ; a teaspoonfiil of 
salt ; turn on boiling water ; stir it quickly ; let it 
stand until cool enough to make into cakes. Make 
them up when the meal is as hot as you can handle 
it ; put them into little iron pans ; bake tliem one 
hour. Must be eaten hot. •

CHAi^TER ON SOUP-MAKING. 

Always rub salt into the meat for soap stock ; 
put it into cold water to boil ; just before it comes 
to a boil skim it well, for if allowed to boil before 
that thick scum is taken off, it will boil into the 
soup, and cannot be taken out at all. Spice, pepper, 
and salt may be put into the pot after it is well 
skiramed ; but never put in vegetables when boiling 
stock, for that would cause it to turn sour. After 
soup stock has boiled enough to extract all the juice 
of the meat, and becomes a jelly, it spoils it to boil 
more. So that if you have a good soup stock of 
meat, all that you have to do is to boil your vegeta- 
bles, that you wish to season with, in just water 
enough to cover them ; let them boil enough to ex- 
tract all the flavor. If you put the soup to boil, and 
the vegetables in it, by the time the flavor is ex- 
tracted nearly half the soup will be boiled away. 

Put a piece of butter in the bottom of the soup- 
pot, with one or more onions sliced, according to the 
quantity of soup to be made, allowing one good-sized 
onion to every quart of soup ; fry the onion a nice 
brown ; .dredge in a little flour to brown ; strain the 
water from the vegetables through a cullender into 
the pot ; add as much of meat stock as you wish to 
have soup; stir this up, and boil it about fifteen 
minutes. If you wish to flavor with wine, put it 



BOUP-MAKINO. 219 

into the tureen, and pour !ie hot soup on to it, for 
if 70U put it to boil with the soup the flavor is lost 
It is the same with Catsup or soy, or any seasoning 
of that kind. 

Bread-crumbs, too, should be put into the tureen^ 
as they will become too soft if boiled. 

TO MAKE A SOUP STOCK. 

What I call brown stock, is made of beef shins and 
a piece of coarse beef. White stock is made of veal 
shins, and an old fowl if you choose. 

One hind shin of veal will make three quarts of 
good veal stock ; one hind shin of beef will make 
five quarts of good beef stock ; one beef shin and one 
veal shin together will make eight quarts. - The 
veal and beef together make tlie best soup. You 
can buy half of each, if you do not want as much as 
the whole will make. Wash the shins clean, but do 
not soak them; rub over them a little salt; put 
tliem into an iron pot, and put in twice as much 
water as you expect to have soup. It must be set 
on the fire to come to a boil ; do not forget to skim 
it before it comes to a boil ; then set it back on the 
range, where it will boil gently all day. Keep it 
covered, so that it shall not boil away too fast ; if it 
does boil away too much, add more water, so as to 
keep about the quantity desired. If you require the 
soup to be more meaty or richer, add to the shins a 
good piece of coarse juicy meat, either beef or veal ; 
what ifi called a shoulder-of-mutton piece of beef is 






220 80UP-MAEING. 

very juicy, and about six pounds with the shins will 
make the soup much richer, but the shin is the most 
nutritious in soups. 

All kinds of bones of roast or boiled meat or 
poultry, if boiled long enough, make good soup 
stock. They should be boiled all day to extract the 
substance of the bones as well as the meat, then 
strained into a stone jar or earthen pot, never in tin, 
to stand in a cool place until the fat cools, then take 
that oflF. If this process is observed, you can always 
have a good soup, because you have a good stock to 
begin with ; you can flavor it as you please. 

I have given many receipts for soup, but these re- 
marks are for standard directions. 

ON SOUP-MAKING. 

It is necessary to have a flat-bottomed pot to set 
on, not into, the range, for fear of scorching, as a 
soup is spoiled if it has the slightest taste of being 
burned. It is best to boil the bones in such a pot, 
as they must boil all the time slowly, and a flat- 
bottomed pot can be set back on the range. 

TO DRESS A GBEEN TURTLE FOR SOUP. 

Cut oflF the head, and hang it with the body to 
bleed. When the bleeding has stopped, place the 
turtle on its back ; with a strong sharp knife separate 
the back from the under shell ; take off the fins ; cut 
up the under shell, and put it into a pan with the 
fins ; turn boiling water over them ; let them stand 



i 



80UPMAKIN0. 221 

ten minutes. Take them out; then with your 
fingers and a small knife peel off all the tough skin ; 
throw them into salt and water; take the inwards, 
separate the liver, lights, heart, and sweet-breads 
from the gall ; wash the entrails and inwards very 
clean ; put them into another pan of salt and water 
to soak ; clean the meat and green fat from the top 
shell ; put them all into water, and let them soak 
over night. 

TO MAKE THE SOUP. 

Wash all the turtle ; put it into clear fresn water 
to soak for an hour; leave the liver, lights and 
sweet-breads, heart and green fat, soaking ; the rest 
of the turtle and a calf s head put into about five j 

gallons of water, to boil gently all day (do not use ' 

the haslet with the calfs head) ; tie the liver, lights, 
sweet-bread, and heart, in a cloth ; put them into a « 

pot to boil three hours; take them out to cool to ^ 

make force-meat balls ; strain the soup through a 
coarse cullender ; set it away with the meat in a cool 
place till the next morning. Put about half a pound 
of butter into a l^rge soup-pot, with four large onions 
cut fine ; fry to a nice brown ; take the pot off the 
fire ; add one table-spoonful of ground cloves, one of 
allspice, one of mace, two of grated nutmeg, one of 
pepper, two of salt, two of sweet marjoram, two of 
summer savory, two of chopped parsley ; stir this 
together, then add the soup ; set it to boil ; take 
out with your fingers all the little bones from the 

19 ♦ 



222 SOUP-MAKINO. 

meat ; put all into the soup, adding the green fat ; 
let all boil about four hours. While the soup is 
boiling, chop up very fine the liver, lights, and 
Bweet-bread and heart; add one teacup of bread- 
crumbs, the yolks of four eggs, one teaspoonful 
of ground cloves, one of mace, one of thyme, 
one of sweet marjoram, one of summer savory, 
one of pepper, and two of salt ; drop in two 
raw eggs and half a pound of butter ; mix this all 
up with the hands; make it into balls the size of 
robins' eggs ; roll each in egg and bread-crumbs ; 
fry brown in hot lard ; put up to dry, and keep hot ; 
cut up in small pieces six lemons, six hard-boiled 
eggs ; dividing this into four parts, put one into 
each tureen, with a quarter of the balls in each ; 
then add to the soup one quart of red and one 
of Maderia wine ; give it one boil ; dip it upon the 
lemon, egg, and force-meat balls ; send it to the 
table very hot. This will make four gallons of soup. 
These are directions for a turtle weighing fifty 
pounds in the shell. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

The calfs head should be soaked in cola water one 
hour, and washed very clean. If a large head, allow 
six quarts of cold water ; boil it two hours, then add 
the liver and lights ; tie up the brains in a small 
cloth ; let them boil an hour and a half. Take up 
the head ; strain the liquor into a stone jar ; set it 
away to cool until the next day. When the soup is 



80UP-M1KIN0. 223 

to be made, take off all the fat ; put about one quart 
of the stock, oue quart of cold water to boil, with 
two large onious, two carrots, two turnips, a stalk of 
celery, one dozen cloves, one dozen pepper-corns, 
one table-spoonful of salt ; boil it slowly two hours. 
Have a flat-bottomed soup-pot ; set it on the fire to 
get hot ; put a little butter in it, with two onions cut 
fine, to brown — a nice light brown ; stir them all 
the time to prevent burning; dredge in a little flour. 
Have the calfs head cut in small pieces ; then strain 
the vegetables from the stock ; put all this into the 
soup-pot, and let it boil one hour. If you like the 
soup very dark, add one table-spoonful of allspice. 

TO MAKE THE BALLS. 

Take half a pound of raw veal, and some of the 
liver, lights, and brains ; chop them very fine, and 
season well with pepper, salt, ground cloves, sweet 
herbs ; drop in two raw eggs ; mix this well ; roll it 
into balls the size of a common nut ; roll them in 
egg and crumbs, and fry them in hot lard. 

Boil two eggs hard ; lay them in cold water until 
they are quite cold ; take the yolks, and mash them 
fine ; add half a table-spoonful of flour and a little 
salt ; mix this together ; then take a little into your 
left hand, and rub it with your right into a small 
ball ; make it all up into balls. Cut a lemon in 
small pieces. If the soup does not seem quite rich 
enough, take quarter of a pound of good batter ; 
braid into it a large spoonful of flour ; stir this into 



224 80UP-MAKIN0. 

tho 80iip ; let it boil about five minutes ; add a 
tumblerful of white wiiie. Put the foree-meat balls, 
egg balls, and lemou into the tureen ; turn the hot 
soup on to them. I think this soup as good as a 
turtle soup. 

A CLEAR SOQP. 

Gut up a large shin of beef and one of veal ; put 
them to boil in ten quarts of water ; let it boil all 
day ; do not forget to skim it very well ; put in one 
dozen white pepper-corns, a few bits of mace, three 
bay leaves ; keep the pot covered tight that it may 
r.ot require much more water, that is, that you may 
have about five quarts of soup. Strain it into a 
stone jar, and set it to cool. The next day take off 
all the fat ; you will have a strong jelly ; two hours 
before the soup is wanted, cut up four carrots, four 
turnips, and four onions ; just cover them with hot 
water, and set them on the fire to steep two hours ; 
strain this into the soup-pot ; put in the jelly ; let it 
boil half an hour ; beat up three eggs and shells ; 
stir them in, and let it boil ten minutes ; set it back 
on the range where it will keep hot, but not boil ; 
add one cup of cold water ; if it requires any more 
seasoning, add a little essence of celery or cloves, or 
whatever you prefer, in the tureen. Strain the soup 
through a flannel bag as you would jelly ; if it cools 
it must be put into the soup-pot and heated over, as 
it must be served- very hot. Put a pint of white 
wine in the tureen if you like. 



SOUP-MAKINO. 225 

POTATO SOUP. 

Boil four large mealy potatoes ; mash them fine ; 
add one egg, a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, a little essence of celery. 
Boil one pint of water, and one pint of inilk or 
cream ; turn it on to the potatoes, ^c, boiling hot ; 
stir it well ; strain it, and send to the table immedi- 
ately. 

ANOTHER POTATO SOUP, 

A nice soup with very little expense. If you have 
merely the carcass of any kind of poultry from a 
previous dinner, put it on to boil in about two quarts 
of water, with one large onion cut in small pieces, 
one carrot, one turnip, a little mace, or bay leaf ; let 
this boil three hours. Take six large boiled pota 
toes ; mash them fine ; add one egg, a little salt and 
pepper ; strain the soup on to this. There will be 
about three pints of soup ; add one pint of milk ; 
give it one boil, and send it to the table. 

JULIENNE SOUP. 

Put a piece of butter the size of an egg into the 
soup-pot ; stir it until it melts ; cut three young 
onions fine ; fry them a nice brown ; then put in two 
quarts good veal or white stock, a little mace, pep- 
per, salt, three young carrots, three turnips, a stalk 
of celery, a pint of green peas. Boil it all one hour. 
This is a nice summer soup. 



226 SbUP-MAKINO. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

The same as above, with a young cabbage cut 
fine ; add beef stock, and season with doves instead 
of mace. 

YEllMtCBLLt SOUP 

Boil a shin of veal, two onions, two carrots, two 
turnips cut up, a little salt, in four quarts of water, 
three hours ; strain it ; add two cups of vermicelli ; 
1' t it boil half an hour. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil a shin of veal in four quarts of water four 
hours; add pepper, salt, two onions, two carrots, 
two turnips, two dozen tomatoes ; boil one hour ; 
then strain out all the vegetables. Mix one cup of 
ground rice or arrowroot; stir it into the soup; add 
one cup of sugar ; give it one boil. Send it to table 
very hot. Serve with it toasted bread cut in small 
pieces, and put in a dish to be passed to those who 
like it. 

ANOTHER TOMATO SOUP. 

If you have but little to make soup of, and want 
it without preparing the day before^ put the bones 
into the pot with one onion, one carrot, and one 
dozen tomatoes ; cut the vegetables up ; pepper ; 
half a dozen cloves ; let this boil two or three hours ; 
strain out the bones and tomato seeds ; skim off the 
fat ; turn the soup back into the pot, with a cup of 
cold water, about two table-spoonfuls of arrowroot, 



soup-MAKma. 227 

ground rice or flour ; stir this into the soup ; add 
half a cup of sugar ; let it boil ten minutes. Take 
some toasted bread, cut it into small square pieces, 
put them into the tureen, and dip the soup on to 
them. This, you perceive, posts but little, and helps 
your dinner a great deal. 

OYSTER SOUP WTTHOUT MEAT. 

To two quarts of oysters put one quart of cold 
water ; wash out the oysters clean ; strain the water 
through a fine sieve or cloth. Put a piece of butter 
the size of an egg into a large saucepan ; dredge in 
some flour, a little pepper, and a very little mace ; 
turn in the liquor, and let it come to a boil ; put in 
two large spoonfuls of cracker-crumbs, mixed in a 
little water ; stir this well ; add a piece more butter, 
and then the oysters ; let it boil up once. Have 
ready in the tureen some soft crackers split and 
toasted ; turn the soup in, and add a cup of white 
wine, or a spoonful of good vinegar or lemon juice. 

ANOTHER OYSTER SOUP. 

A very good oyster soup may be made without 
meat. Strain off all the water firom the oysters ; add 
as much hot water as you have oyster water ; add a 
little mace, pepper, and salt ; let it boil five minutes : 
then put in the oysters ; let it boil up once. Have 
ready some toasted crackers buttered } turn the 
soup on to them. 



228 SOUP-MAKING. 

ANOTHER. 

Add to the boiling liquor a few cracker crumbs 
and a piece of butter ; 8tir into the soup ; then put 
in the oysters ; give it one boil. If you like, add a 
glass of white wine or cream. 

A LOBSTEB SOUP 

May be made without meat. Gut the meat of 
lobsters fine. Break up the bones and shell ; boil 
them one hour in about two quarts of water ; strain 
out the bones, and put in the lobster ; boil it half an 
hour. Braid a little flour into a piece of butter the 
size of an egg ; stir this in, and let it boil once ; 
season it with pepper and salt, and a little vinegar 
or wine. 

NOODLES FOB SOUP. 

Beat two or three eggs, add a little salt, and stir 
in flour enough till the mixture is as stifle a paste as 
can be rolled ; flour the rolling-pin and board so as 
to roll it smoothly. Boll it in three strips ; let them 
lay an hour to dry ; roll each piece in a long roll, 
and cut it in slices as thin as possible ; shake them 
apart, and let them lay and dry, as it makes them 
lighter, and prevents their sticking together. After 
the soup is skimmed drop the noodles in, and let 
them boil twenty minutes. These are nice in any 
dark soup. 



FISH. 229 

MULUOATAWNT SOUP. 

Placo in a stew-pau four ounces of butter, four 
large onions cut in slices, one carrot, two heads of 
celery cut small, and fry slowly till the onions are 
nearly melted and of a nice light brown ; then add 
as much flour as will thicken the quantity of soup to 
be made. Stir this over the fire for a few minutes, 
after having first mixed with it two or three table- 
spoonfuls of the best curry powder, and then as much 
consomm^ of veal or white stock as will make a 
sufficient quantity of soup. Now put it on the fire 
and stir till it boils ; then place it by the side of the 
fire to clarify in the usual way. Next rub it through 
a cullender into a pur^e ; pour it into a soup-pot, 
and place it again on the fire ; let it boil ten 
minutes; add the meat of a boiled fowl cut into 
small slices, free from bone, and the juice of two 
lemons ; skim thoroughly ; ascertain that the sea- 
soning is correct, and send to the table with some 
rice in a separate dish. 



FISH. 

CLUB CHOWDEB. 

Have prepared the following : A good stock from 
veal or beef ; water will answer, but the chowder is 
better with stock. Boil twelve potatoes, and mash

230 FISH. 

them. Slice and frj brown six large onions. Soak 
two ship or other hard biscuit soft. Fry four slice? 
of pork cut in small dice. Cut in slices about an 
inch thick eight pounds of fish : cod, sea-bass, had* 
dock, or black fish are the best. Have chopped fine 
three table-spoonfuls of parsley. 

Have a pot capable of holding three gallons, in 
which first put five or six table-spoonfuls of butter ; 
scatter over one half of the fried onions ; add a table- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of black pepper, a tea- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg and ground clove mixed. 
Put in ^ layer of fish, and then a layer of mashed 
potato, and one half the biscuit ; add a bouquet of 
thyme or summer savory ; repeat the same opera- 
tion, leaving out the spice and thyme. Then pour 
in your stock or water, sufficient to cover the fish 
about four inches ; add the parsley, also the juice 
of a lemon, squeezed into a tumbler of water in which 
you have dissolved four or five lumps of sugar. 
Place it on the fire, and let it cook gently an hour 
and a half. Color the chowder a dark brown. It 
should be of the consistency of calf s head soup. If 
too thin, thicken it with a little flour and water. 
The fried pork you can add before it is served, if you 
fancy it. I never use it. Just before serving, add 
a small tumbler of Maderia or sherry. 

Preserved mushrooms, clams, or oysters add to 
tlie flavor. If the quantity of spice does not suit the 
taste, add as much more as you please. 



FISH. 231 

QUiBAUO CH0WDE3. 

The quahaugs should be put into a pot with watef 
enough to half cover thera ; boil them twenty min- 
utes. Then take out the quahaugs, and make it 
the same as clam chowder. 

CLAM CHOWDEB. 

Be very sure that the dams are fresh. One peck 
of clams put into an iron pot to boil with one quart 
of water. Cover very close to keep the steam in ; 
when the clams open, turn them out into a large tin 
pan ; take out all the meat from the shells ; set 
them to cool. Strain the water back into the pot to 
boil ; just before it boils skim it well. Have peeled 
and sliced about six large potatoes; put into the 
water to boil ; fry four slices of nice salt pork ; take 
out the pork ; slice up four onions very fine ; fry 
them slowly until they are soft ; break up nine 
crackers fine ; put to soak in milk ; twenty minutes 
before dinner set the soup-pot on the fire ; put in 
the pork, onions, crackers, pepper, and salt ; turn 
the water and potatoes in ; stir it up ; rub together 
half a cup of fine cracker crumbs, a quarter of a 
pound of butter (having taken the blade heads off 
of the clams) ; stir in the butter and clams ; boil 
slowly fifteen minutes. This makes a very superior 
clam chowder. 

PRIED COD AND HADDOCK. 

Cut the fish in pieces about the size to help to 



232 FISH. 

each person (always wash fish iu salt and water, and 
wipe it dry) ; have ready an egg beat up on ono 
plate, and some fine bread or cracker crumbs on 
another ; lay the fish in the egg, then in the crumbs ; 
have the fat or lard about two inches deep, quite 
hot; fry the fish a light brown. Serve with 
drawn butter. 

FBESH TONGUES AND BOUNDS. 

Fried in the same manner. 

SALT TONGUES AND SOUNDS. 

Put them into cold water, and boil them until 
tender. 

BOILED BASS. 

Scrape off the scales ; wash it in salt and water ; 
lay it into the fish-kettle, with boiling water enough 
to cover it. Boil it half an hour, if weighing six or 
eight pounds. 

BAKED BASS. 

The same as baked cod. 

BAKED PICKEREL. 

The same as above. 

FRIED FLOUNDERS. 

Scrape them clean; take off the heads; wash 
them in salt and water ; wipe them dry ; gash them 
crosswise ; lay them into hot fat. Fry a light brown, 
or broil as codfish. 



FISH. 233 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Get large sized oysters. Have an egg beat up ou 
a plate, and cracker crumbs ou another ; take each 
oyster on a fork ; dip it first in the egg, and then the 
crumbs ; prepare your oysters. Have the fat hot, 
drop in the oysters, and fry them a nice brown. 

SCULLOPS. 

These are best fried. Dip them into egg and 
crumbs ; have ready a deep pan full of hot lard ; fry 
them quickly ; have a small skimmer to take them 
from the fat ; put them into a cullender, and keep 
them hot until all are fried. 

SALMON PIE. 

Three and a half pounds of salmon. Boil as for 
the table. Take out the bones, and mash it fine^ 
Add about one third more mashed potato than fish ; 
quarter pound of butter ; one quart of cream ; salt. 
Fill the pie dish ; brush the top with the yolk of an 
egg, and bake one hour. Serve with it egg sauce, 
or lemon cut in dice form in the sauce. 

Cod can be used instead of salmon. 

STEWED LOBSTER ON TOAST. 

Chop a nice fresh lobster weighing about six 
pounds quite fine; put it into a saucepan, with a 
large cup of cream, a piece of butter the size of a i 

cup, a little salt, and cayenne pepper to flavor pretty \ 

20* 



234 nsH. 

strong ; stir this up ; beat it hot (do not let it stand 
to fry) ; have ready some slices of toast cut rather 
thick, and buttered ; turn the lobster over it, and 
serve it hot. Sprinkle a little coral over it. 

THE CORAL OR ROE OF LOBSTER 

Should be always taken out, washed, and wiped 
dry. Grated fine, it is a great improvement 
sprinkled over any dish made of lobster ; or with 
hard boiled eggs and parsley, for any dish of fish. 

STEWED EELS. 

Gut the eels in pieces about four inches long ; 
wash them clean, and wipe them dry ; sprinkle a 
little salt and pepper over them. Gut three or four 
slices of salt pork, and fry them a nice brown ; slice 
an onion, and fry that brown; dredge in a little 
flour ; lay in the eels, and let them fry a little ; add 
one cup of hot water; cover them close, and let 
them stew twenty minutes. 

SWOBD-FISH 

Is best sliced and boiled, or stewed like tautog. 

SOFT CRAB. 

Wash clean, wipe dry, and lay on to a gridiron ; 
broil about five minutes. 



MEATS. 285 



MEATS. 



BONED TUSKET. 



Take a young hen turkey weighing about ten 
pounds ; clean it well, and wipe it dry ; lay it on a 
meat-board. With a sharp knife split down the 
back ; with a small, sharp-pointed knife take out all 
the bones, beginning at the wing ; press the knife 
close to the bone, cutting slowly ; be careful not to 
cut the skin. After cutting the bones from the 
wings, cut to the breast-bone and draw out the bones 
of the breast and wings ; then cut round the leg. 
After drawing out all the bones, wash the turkey, 
and wipe it dry ; have ready a stuffing made of very 
fine chopped veal, two sausages, bread crumbs, mace, 
pepper, salt, sweet herbs, and a little ham or tongue, 
two raw eggs ; add a few truffles or mushrooms if 
you like (a few strips of cold boiled tongue, a few 
strips of very tender cold veal, laid into the turkey 
lengthwise, intermixed with the dressing, is a great 
improvement to the appearance when cut) ; mix this 
up well ; lay the turkey on the meat-board ; lay the 
dressing on, filling the wings, legs, and breast ; with 
a strong, fine twine and meat-needle sew up the 
turkey. Form it as well as possible with your hands ; 
skewer down the wings, tie down the legs. Break 
up two calFs feet, with the bones of the turkey, a 
little mace, pepper, sialt, a carrot and an onion cut 



236 MEATS. 

into small bits ; put all into a covered saucepan or a 
Boup-pot with two quarts of water ; lay the turkey 
on to the bones; let it boil slowly three hours. 
Take up the turkey, strain out the bones, beat the 
whites of two eggs ; put the liquor back to boil ; add 
the eggs and shells, one lemon cut small, and a cup 
of white wine ; let it boil about five minutes ; set it 
back ; add one cup of cold water ; let it stand fifteen 
minutes; strain the liquor through a flannel bag. 
Put a pint into a small mould to place on the breast 
of the turkey, the rest on a dish ; when cold cut the 
jelly in square pieces, and lay them round the turkey 
to garnish the dish. 

GREEN LEGGED FLOVEB 

Are very fat, and almost as large as partridges. 
They should be roasted or broiled twenty or thirty 
minutes. 

WOODCHUCK 

Should be stuffed, and roasted three quarters 
of an hour. 

HABE OB BABBITS, 

Stuffed and roasted, are very nice ; or fricasseed, 
or made into pie the same as pigeons. 

beab's meat 
Is best roasted or brpiled, like beef or venison. 

CHICKEN PATES. 

Boll a nice puff paste about quarter of an inch 



MEATS. 237 

thick ; cut it with a pretty-shaped paste-cutter ; lay 
it on a tin sheet, put a spoonful of the mince into 
the middle, cut another piece of paste the same size 
and shape and lay over it. Brush this over with the 
white of an egg, and bake it in a quick oven about 
fifteen minutes. 

Six or eight of these make a very pretty dish. 

PATTIES IN PASTE. 

Make a nice puff paste ; roll it very thin ; cut it 
into handsome shapes. Have ready some minced 
chicken or veal, seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, 
and the yolk of an egg ; lay this between two pieces 
of paste ; fry them in hot lard. Serve them stand- 
ing in a dish resting on each other. 

MUTTON CHOP WTTH TOMATOES. 

Take iabout a dozen mutton chops, with the small 
bones in them ; pound them a little with the cleaver 
to make them smooth ; roll them in egg and crumbs ; 
fry them a light brown. Place some baked tomatoes 
in the centre of a dish and the chops round them, 
with the bones meeting over the top. 

BBESLAN OF BEEF. 

Mince some cold roast beef and a little tongue 
very fine ; season it with a little pepper, salt, and 
one egg ; put it into a pretty-shaped mould ; turn it 
out on to a tin sheet ; brush it over with an egg ; set 
it into the oven to brown. 



238 MEATS. 

GBATEO HAM. 

Take the under part of a cold ham, which is rather 
hard to eat, and grate it up like cheese ; put it into 
a stone jar. This is very nice for seasoning. 

DROPPED EGGS WITH HAM. 

Have a small pan of hot water ; drop the eggs in 
carefully so as not to break the yolk ; with a spoon 
dip the hot water on to the yolk until a white skin 
forms over it ; then with an egg-slice take the eggs 
out carefully, one at a time. Drop the eggs on but- 
tered toast ; rub the egg lightly with a little butter ; 
sprinkle over it a little grated ham or flour. Send 
to table plain. 

FBIED HAM AND EGGS 

Have a slice from the middle of the ham ; cut the 
rind, not the fat, off with a sharp knife ; rub the pan 
with a very little butter ; lay the ham in ; it will 
fry in its own fat. When the ham is done, that is, 
when the fat part is brown on both sides, take it up. 
If you have any fat that is dripped from a roast ham 
(that is best), put three or four large spoonfuls of it 
into the frying-pan ; when it is quite hot, break the 
eggs into it very carefully, one at a time ; with a 
spoon dip the fat on to the egg till you see a white 
skin form over it, then with an egg-slice lift it <mt so 
as not to break the egg« Lay the ham on the dish. 



MEATS. 239 

and the eggs roand it. A dish of handsomely fried 
ham and eggs looks very tempting, but if the eggs 
are broken or fried hard, it is scarcely fit to eat 

FRIED OB BBOILED SALT PORK. 

Cut the slices even, not too thick ; cut the rind a 
little about two inches apart ; lay them into a clean 
frying-pan ; fry a nice yellow brown, first on one 
side and then on the other. Or, lay the slices on a 
gridiron, and broil both sides. 

pig's feet stewed. 

Half a dozen pig's feet into a saucepan; cover 
them with water ; season them with pepper and salt, 
and an onion chopped fine, and a table-spoonful of 
vinegar. Stew them half an hour. Serve feet and 
gravy in the same dish. 

beefsteak and onions. 

Out up six onions ; fry them in a saucepan in but- 
ter until a nice brown ; turn in half a cup of hot 
water ; dredge in a little flour, pepper, salt ; broil a 
beefsteak, lay it into the pan with the onions, cover 
it tight, and let it stew about five minutes. Serve it 
very hot. 

beef pudding. 

Line a pudding mould with a good paste crust ; 
scald and skin about a half of a beef kidney ; cut in 



240 SALADS. 

small pieces ; chop fine one onion ; cut not very 
thin slices of tender beefsteak ; season with cavenne 
pepper, salt, a very little cloves ; put into the mould. 
Add a cup of good beef stock ; cover the pudding 
with the crust ; put on the cover of the mould, set 
into the steamer to steam two or three hours, de- , 
pending on the size. 



SALADS. 



CHICKEN SALAD. 



A PAIR of fowl weighing about six pounds will 
make a nice dish of salad. The chickens should be 
well boiled. Take oflF all the skin (some persons do 
not use the dark meat ; it is quite as tender as the 
white, and when dressed, does not show the differ- 
ence) ; chop the meat very fine (be sure to take out 
all the little bits of gristle or sinews). Out up three 
good heads of tennis-ball lettuce into quarters ; wash 
it all clean, and lay it in ice-water for two or three 
hours, that it may be crisp. If celery is used, split it 
fine, and put into ice-water as long as you would the 
lettuce, as it must be brittle to be good. 

LOBSTER SALAD 

Cut the lobster in small pieces, but do not chop it 
Cif there is a roe or coral, as it is called, in the 



SALADS. 241 

lobster, wash it clean in cold water, wipe it dry, and 
grate it on a plate, and use it to ornament the salad). 
Put as much dressing as you think will eat well with 
the lobster ; mix it up well with a fork and spoon ; 
then turn on a very little vinegar ; mix this well, 
and place it on a flat dish. Wipe the celery or 
lettuce as dry as possible, and lay it round the dish. 
This I do for dinner, that persons may be helped 
to either lobster and lettuce, or lobster alone, which 
some prefer. 

CHICKEN SALAD, 

Made by not chopping or cutting the chicken, is 
very nice. Either boiled or roast chicken may be 
skinned, then pull the meat off the bone in small 
pieces, and dress it the same as other chicken salad. 
The chicken must be cooked very tender to pull oflF 
in nice pieces. For evening company it is best to 
cut the lettuce or celery, and mix with the meat or 
lobster, and serve it in a salad bowl. 

TO MAKE THE DRESSING. 

Take two hard-boiled eggs, lay them into cold 
water until quite cold ; put the yolks into a small 
wooden bowl; mash the eggs very fine with the 
back of a spoon (I keep a wooden spoon and bowl 
for this purpose) ; add the yolks of two raw eggs, 
one large teaspoonful of salt, one large table-spoonful 
of dry mustard, a very little cayenne pepper; stir 
this well, always one way ; when well mixed, add a 

21 



242 SALADS. 

very little sweet oil, stirring all the time ; after this 
is mixed well, put in more, verj little at a time, 
until jou have used a third of a bottle ; then add a 
large spoonful of vinegar or lemon juice ; then more 
oil as before, using in all two thirds of a bottle of 
oil ; then another spoonful of vinegar. When well 
mixed, it must be very light and a nice color. Set 
it on the ice for two or three hours. Not more than 
twenty minutes before using the salad mix it, and 
prepare for the table by putting with the meat about 
half of the dressing ; stir it up well ; then turn on to 
the meat one wineglass of the best of vinegar ; stir 
this up well ; it will turn the chicken very white. 
If it requires a little more salt, add it now. Place 
the chicken in the centre of a flat dish large enough 
to lay the lettuce or celery round the meat. Wipe 
the lettuce as dry as you can, and lay it round the 
meat with a spoon ; put the rest of the dressing ou 
the lettuce or celery. 

THE SALAD DBESSIKO 

May be kept a week by putting it into a stone jar 
covered close, and keeping it in the ice-chest. . 

It is very convenient to place a glass jar of the 
dressing on the table with a dish of lettuce and a 
lobster opened,* and served plain ; or if you wish to 
make a salad quickly, in case of unexpected com- 
pany, it helps to enlarge the dinner. . 

Gold boiled potatoes or beets sliced, or a white 
cabbage cut fine and laid in ice-water, all make nice 
salads. 



SALAJDS. 243 

A good dressing may be made without e^s to be 
used immediately, bat will not keep as the other* 
Use two very good boiled mealy potatoes instead of 
eggs ; mix it the same as the egg dressing. 

MOTONAIBS OF SALMON. 

Boil the salmon as you would to serre plain ; take 
up on to a dish ; take out all the bone with a knife ; 
take off all the skin ; put it into a deep dish ; spread 
over it a little pepper, salt, a few cloves ; just cover 
it with vinegar, and let stand until wanted. It is 
better to remain in the spice and vinegar over night. 
Lay on to the dish it is to be served on ; have the 
dressing the same as for lobster ; cover the salmon 
with a plenty of dressing ; have the salad the same 
as for lobster. This is a very nice dish — more of a 
variety than lobster, therefore more fashionable. A 
bass or cusk dressed in the same way is very good. 
Salmon trout is quite as good as salmon. 

Any kind of cold boiled fish left of a previous 
dinner, prepare^ in this way, is a piece of economy. 

A VEAL SALAD. 

Take a shin of veal, put it into an iron pot with 
six quarts of water ; add a little mace, pepper, and 
salt ; let it boil six hours. The water will bo almost 
absorbed ; pick out all the bones, and season it very 
well with ground mace, cinnamon, pepper, and salt ; 
add two teacups of very fine cracker crumbs ; stir 
them up well. Take a melon-shaped mould, cut 



244 TEGSTAmJEflL 

three hard-boiled eggs in strips lengthwfae, rub the 
mould with a little of the juice of the meat, place the 
eggs round the sides of tlie mould, and fill it with 
the mixture, and set it away in a cool place. 

This is a very handsome dish to slice cold for a 
lunch or tea, or to place on a supper table, orna- 
mented with lettuce or celery.

pepper, and flour ; drop a small piece of butter into 
the frying-pan ; when it is hot laj in the plant ; fry 
it a nice brown on both sides. 

EGG PLANT IN BATTER. 

Make a batter with an egg, a cup of flour, a little 
salt, water enough to make a thin batter. Dip the 
slices of plant into the batter, then fry them in hot 
fat a light brown. 

BAKED EGG PLANT. 

Cut off the stalk end about an inch and a half; 
scrape out the inside with a spoon ; mix with this a 
boiled onion chopped fine, a cupful of fine-chopped 
meat of any kind, half a cup of bread crumbs well 
seasoned with pepper, salt, and spice of any kind ; 
drop in one raw egg ; mix this all up well ; fill the 
plant. Bake it half an hour. 

POTATO BICE. 

When boiling potatoes some are apt to get broken ; 
throw the pieces into a cullender ; rub them through 
with a spoon into a dish ; set it into the oven for five 
minutes. Dish as a vegetable, or garnish a tongue 
by laying it round the dish. 



YfiQETiLBLEl^L 247 

Eggs prepared in the same way make a pretty 
garnishing for side dishes of light meats. 

HACCABONI AS A VEGETABLE. 

Break up a vegetable dish half full of maccaroni 
in small pieces. Lay them in a saucepan, just cover

let it boil half an hour ; add a piece of butter half 
the size of an egg, a little salt, if you like, a table- 
spoonful of grated cheese ; stir this up, and serve in 
a vegetable dish. 

PEABS AS VEGETABLES, 

Or used instead of apple or cranoerry sauce. 
Take about two quarts of water that corned beef is 
boiling in ; put it into a saucepan with six good iron 
pears ; boil them an hour and a half. These are 
nice with corned beef* 

POTATO BALLS. 

Mash eight nicely boiled potatoes ; add a little 
salt, butter half the size of an egg, two spoonfuls of 
cream ; stir it well ; roll it with your hands into 
balls ; roll them in egg and crumbs ; fry them in 
hot fat, or brown them in the oven. 

Sweet potatoes should always be baked, as boiling 
in water spoils them. 

TO KEEP TOMATOES FOR WINTER USE. 

Get your tomatoes as soon as well ripened ; put 



248 VEGETABLES. 

tlicm into wooden tubs, turn on boiling water, cover 
them up, and let them stand one hour. Then 
with a knife peel them, and lay them into pans; 
sprinkle in some salt, then some tomatoes and more 
salt ; set them in a cool place over night. In the 
morning turn off the water ; put the tomatoes in the 
preserving kettle to boil ; be sure they boil. Have 
ready the cans, by filling them with hot water until 
hot, then turn out the water. Set them into hot 
water while filling, as it is very important to exclude 
the air entirely. It takes two persons to put them 
up well, one to fill the cans and the other to stop 
them up tight while hot. I use Kuight*s improved 
cans ; they are much less trouble, and if put up 
carefully, I think it as good as soldering. Any kind 
of can is good which keeps out the air entirely. 

PUTTING UP SWEET COBN. 

Use the very best young corn ; put it to boil 
fifteen minutes ; with the handle of an iron spoon 
scrape all tlie corn from the cob ; then put the corn 
to boil with a little water, just enough to keep it 
from burning. When boiling hot, put it into tin 
cans, and seal them immediately. When wanted to 
use, put it into a saucepan with a very little milk, 
butter, and salt ; cook it fifteen minutes. 



PiLSTBT. 249 



PASTRY. 



PUFF PASTE* 



Wash the butter in cold water ; slap it into a tliia 
eake, and lay it on the ice to get perfi^tly cold. To 
a pound of butter take a pound of flour ; mix half 
of the butter with the flour, wet with ice-water just 
enough to stick it together ; rcdl it out to half an 
inch thickness, put on half of the butter that remains 
in small bits ; dredge this with flour ; roll up the 
paste, then roll it out again, thin ; put on the rest of 
the butter ; roll it up and out again three or four 
times. The more it is rolled the more flaky it will 
be. This must be done quickly, taking care not to 
handle it any more than you can possibly help. Put 
it on the ice to keep cool until the filling for the 
pies is prepared. Butter the plates^ then roll out 
the covering of the plates, and put it on them. 
Then roll a long strip to cut for the rims ; brush 
over the rim with cold water, with a paste brush, and 
between each, layer. This makes the paste more 
puffy. Fill tlie pies; cover them with the crust 
rolled quickly ; brush the top with the white of an 
egg beat up. This gives a glossy appearance when 
baked. Bake in a quick oven. 

A PASTE TO KEEP ON HAND. 

Take two cups of butter, one of lard, six cups of 



250 PUDDINGS. 

flour ; with a knife cut the butter and lard into the 
flour; add a little ice-water; keep cutting with a 
knife until you work it into a paste. Sprinkle a lit- 
tle flour on the paste-board, roll out the paste, then 
roll it up ; then roll again ; roll it up in a clean 
cloth, and lay it on the ice to keep. When wanted 
for use, roll out the paste, spread on a little butter, 
dredge on a little flour ; roll it up ; then roll it out 
again. This should be repeated five or six times, 
and you will have a very nice puff paste for vol-au- 
▼ent, patties, or anything that paste is recommended 
for. 



PUDDINGS. 

LEMON PIE, OB PUDDING. 

Take four lemons, grate the rind, squeeze the

BECETPT FOB MAKING BBEAD PUDDING. 

Ill making any kind of a bread pudding, it is much 
nicer to put what eggs you wish to put into the pud- 
ding into the milk ; turn that on to the bread to

PUDDINO. SAUCE. 

Beat to a cream half a pound of butter and half a 
pound of white sugar. It must be well beaten or 
your sauce will not froth. Boil a small tumbler of 
wine and one of water together ; stir this and the 
butter together very quickly ; it will be a perfect 
froth. Send it to the table as soon as made ; add a 
little nutmeg or essence of any kind. Do not put it 
on to the fire after it is mixed, or you will spoil the 
frothy appearance.

are more likelf to hnYe good cake, than if obliged to 
beat a little, and then take your hands out to pre- 
pare other ingredients. Line jour cake pans with 
buttered paper, the cake is not so apt to burn ; it is 
well to have a clean paper ready to put on the top 
if the oven is too hot. In putting the materials to* 
getlier, butter and sugar should be beaten together, 
and eggs beaten separately, as the whites need more 
beating than the yolks. Butter the pans, as any 
other fat may leave an unpleasant flavor. 

ICEINO FOB CAKE.

white sugar, with a very little vanilla or orange 
flower water ; beat them together until very light.

flour into the rest just enough to mix it well. Bake 
it in a quick oven half an hour ; try it with a broom 
straw; if done, the straw will come out clean, if not, 
the cake will stick to the straw. You must not take 
the cake out of the oven to try it, as it will not be 
light if removed from the oven before it is baked 
enough.

PRESERVES. 

BBANDT PEACHES. 

Turn boiling water over the peaches ; let them 
stand, covered up tight, twenty minutes ; with a 
cloth take off all the skin. Have ready a syrup of 
half the weight of fruit ; put just enough peaches to 
swim on the top ; let them boil fifteen minutes ; 
take them out on a dish to cool them. To a quart 
of syrup, put one quart of brandy. Put the peaches 
into the jars ; cover them with the brandy and 
syrup, and cover them very tight, to exclude all the 
air at a time, until you have boiled them. 

APRICOTS AND PLUMS. 

The same as peaches. 
23 



266 PRESERVES. 

BRANDY PEARS. 

Peel them with a knife very nice and even to look 
well ; boil them in water fifteen minutes ; lay them 
on a flat dish to cool. Make a syrup half the weight 
of the fruit ; put the pears in to boil fifteen minutes ; 
let them cool. Put them into the jars ; fill the jars 
half full of syrup and the rest white brandy. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Take a very strong thin cloth ; mash the currants 
with your hands until they are thoroughly broken ; 
then put as many into the cloth as you can squeeze 
by taking each end of the cloth ; wring them very 
liard. Two persons can do much better than one, 
for it requires a great deal of strength. When the 
juice is all extracted, measure a pound of sugar to a 
pint of juice ; let it boil about fifteen minutes ; 
strain it into the jars. Small jars are best for jelly ; 
let them stand uncovered exposed to tlie sun for 
three or four days. Wet a paper with brandy ; lay 
on the top of the jelly. Cut paper large enough to 
tie down round the jar; brush the paper over with 
the white of an egg ; with your finger press it down 
close and tie it tight, — or a bladder is still better. 

CANNING FRUIT, OR PRESERVING PEACHES. 

I always . use . the best of fruit for preserving. 
Take nice firee-stone peaches, rather hard ; lay them 
into a pan ; turn on boiling water enough to cover 
them ; cover them tight to keep the steam in ; lot 



PBESERVES, 267 

tlicm stand until the water is cool enough for you 
to handle them ; peel them with your fingers rather 
than a knife. Allow three pounds of sugar to nine 
pounds of fruit ; put the sugar into the preserving- 
kettle, with one cup of the water that the peaches 
were scalded in ; set it on the fire, and stir it until 
the sugar is melted. Put in as many peaches as the 
svrup will cover ; let them boil about fifteen minutes. 
Rinse the cans out with bpiling water to heat them. 
Put the peaches boiling hot into the cans ; set the 
cans in hot water while filling ; pour the syrup over 
them, and cover them tiglit. These will keep as 
well as if one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 
Any kind of fruit may be done in this way. 

PRESERVED BARBERjBT. 

To a pound of fruit a pound of good brown sugar. 
To a peck, one quart of cold water ; let it boil up 
once ; then set it aside, and let it simmer one hour. 
This is very nice to put into water to drink ; in case 
of sickness it is very cooling. 

EGG PLUMS._ 

Turn on boiling water, and let them stand five 
minutes ; or put them into a cullender, set that into 
a deep pan, then turn on boiling water. As soon as 
the skin cracks, lift out the cullender and peel the 
plums. This will prevent breaking the plums by 
handling or moving them. Then make the syrup, 
pound for pound. Boil the fruit, and when done, 



268 PRESEBVES. 

lay them on a flat dish to cool. Put them into jars, 
and pour the hot syrup over them. Close the jars 
tight. 

DAMSON PLUMS. 

Pick them over ; be sure they are clean ; leave 
the stems on. Make a syrup of one pound of sugar 
to one pound of fruit ; half a gill of water to a pound. 
When the syrup just boils, put in the plums ; let 
them simmer about three Quarters of an hour. Put 
up in glass or china jars; stop tight. All small 
plums may be preserved in the same way. 

HG TOMATOES. 

Get very fine small yellow tomatoes. Make a 
syrup of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; cut 
up one large lemon, or a cup of preserved ginger, to 
every pound. Boil the tomatoes until tender ; lay 
them on a dish to cool ; add the lemon or ginger to 
tlie syrup, and let it boil up once. Put the tomatoes 
in jars ; turn the hot syrup over them, and cover 
them tight. These will keep very well, being better 
the second season than when first done. 

THE STRAWBERRY TOMATOES, 

The same as above. 

STEWING DRIED FRUIT. 

Cover the fruit with cold water ; let it soak three 
or four hours; then let it boil until tender. Add 
sugar to the taste. Do'not stir the fruit much while 
it is stewing, as it would break it, and make it un« 
sightly. 



ICE CBEAM. 269 



ICE CREAM. 



PISTACHIO ICE CREAM. 



Six ounces of pistachio nuts scalded, peeled, and 
pounded fine ; twelve ounces of sugar ; the yolks of 
three eggs well beaten ; one table-spoonful of orange- 
flower water ; a pint and a half of milk, or cream ; 
mix all together, and put it into a saucepan to 
thicken, stirring all the time ; strain it into a bowl. 
Mix together two table-spoonfuls of spinach, greening, 
and half a pint of milk ; stir this into the rest until 
well mixed ; then freeze it like other cream. 

COFFEE ICE CBEAM. 

Half pound of the best of cofiFee ; one quart of 
boiling water turned on to it ; boil it five minutes. 
Stand it off the fire ; add one cup of cold water ; let 
it steep until perfectly clear ; turn this into two 
quarts of boiling milk. Beat up nine eggs with one 
pound of white sugar ; flavor with vanilla. Strain

good milk ; add a pound of sugar ; boil it until dis- 
solved ; stir it on to six well beat eggs, boiling hot. 

23* 



270 ICE CREAM. 

Add three quarts of cream ; flavor with almonds ; 
give it one boil. Strain the whole into the freezer. 
This is a rich ice cream. When frozen, put into 
moulds, and pack it in the ice four or five hours. 

CARAMEL CREAM. 

Put one pound of sugar with one gill of water ; 
boil it and stir it until it gets a light brown color. 
Stir this into one gallon of cream. Add sugar to the 
taste. Freeze this. If the sugar is well browned, 
you will not require any other flavor. 

ICE CREAM MADE OF MILK. 

Boil one quart of milk ; beat up four eggs ; mix 
with them two table-spoonfuls of arrowroot, turning 
the boiled milk into them ; stir it well ; add three 
quarts of cold milk, and two pounds of sugar, and 
the flavoring. The latter should be pretty strong, 
as the freezing destroys it in part. Strain before 
freezing. 

FRESH CURRANTS 

Make a very nice water ice. Take three or four 
quarts of fresh currants ; mash them ; strain out the 
juice ; add to it water and sugar enough to make it 
very rich. Freeze it. 

THE CREAM 

Or custard, for making frozen pudding, should be 
partly frozen before the pudding is put together. 



ICE CREAM. 271 

THE JUICE 

Of any kind of fresh fruit makes a nice water loe. 

FROZEN PUDDING. 

Freeze a cream of any kind as for ice cream," 
about bard enougb to put into a mould (a melon- 
shaped mould is as pretty as any) ; place in the bot- 
tom of the mould any kind of preserved fruit, or 
large strawberries, about an inch apart; then a 
layer of ice cream ; then fruit, and a little pounded 
almonds ; then ice cream, and so on till the mould 
is full ; then cover it with a cloth, and put the tin 
cover on very tight. Pack it in salt and ice for four 
or five hours. 

Brandied fruit of any kind is nice ill these pud« 
dings. 

ESSENCE OF SPINACH. 

Soak half a peck of fresh spinach in water ; drain 
it dry, and pound it well ; put it in a coarse cloth, 
and squeeze the juice into a small saucepan. Wheu 
it is nearly boiling strain it ; add a little fine sugar ; 
stir it until the sugar melts. When cold, bottle it ; 
it will keep some time to use for coloring. 



272 SWEET DISHES. 

SWEET DISHES. 

Cox's gelatine is the best for making wine jelly or 
blanc mange. The directions given by a printed 

paper at the top of each box is very reliable.

of milk to simmer. Beat the yolks of four eggs 
with four ounces of white sugar ; beat the four 
whites to a strong froth ; one pint of thick cream, 
and one wineglass of white wine, to a strong froth. 
When the gelatine is dissolved, stir it into the eggs 
and sugar ; then add the whites, and then the cream, 
and beat them all together. Line the mould with 
lady-fingers, or split a sheet of sponge cake for it ; 
set it on the ice. When the cream is well set, that 
is, when it is a little thick, fill up the mould ; let it 
stand about five hours. Turn it out on to your dish. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM.

Servo with sugar and cream. 

CARAMEL CREAM. 

Put a pound of sugar on to boil until it is almost 
candy ; then let it stand until it turns quite dark ; 
add this to ci'eam as a flavor. It is good to flavor 
custards or blanc mange. Also, with whipped 
cream, it makes an ornament. 

ARROWROOT BLANC MANGE. 

Four even table-spoonfuls of arrowroot wet with a 
little cold water, as in making starch ; turn a pint 
of boiling milk on to it, stirring all the time ;

about two inches ; put it into a bottle, and fill the 
bottle with Maderia wine. This will keep two years.

CUCUMBERS. 



Get very small cucumbers ; wipe them clean, and 
lay them into stone jars. Allow one quart of coarse 
salt to a pail of water ; boil the salt and water til] 



MAKING PICKLES. 275 

the salt is dissolved ; turn it boiling hot on the cu- 
cambers ; cover them up tight, and let them stand 
twenty-four hours. Turn them into a basket to 
drain. Boil as much of the best cider vinegar as 
will cover the cucumbers ; wash out the jars, and 
put the cucumbers into them. Turn the vinegar on 
boiling hot; cover them with cabbage leaves, and 
cover the jars tight. In forty-eight hours they will 
be fit for use. 

Pickles of any kind are good made in the same 
way. 

MANGOES. 

Gut out a small strip at the side, and take out the 
seeds ; fill them with very small onions, horse-radish, 
mustard-seed, cloves, and pepper-corns. Replace 
the piece taken out, and tie them up tight. Prepare 
them the same as cucumbers, only they should 
remain in the salt and, water forty-eight hours in- 
stead of twenty-four. 

PICKLED CABBAGE. 

Take a red cabbage, cut it into thin slices, sprinkle 
it over with a little salt, and cover it with a good 
sharp vinegar. Let it stand two or three days.

minutes put in the fruit, and let it boil till about 
half cooked ; then put them in jars, and cork them 
tight. For peaches a little cinnamon and mace may 
be boiled in the vinegar. For plums, or dark fruit, 
allspice or cloves. 

PICKLED PEACHES. 

Rub the fuzz off the peaches with a coarse towel ; 
stick them full of cloves. Make a syrup, allowing 
half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; let the 
peaches boil in it till they are tender; then put 
them in jars. Add half a pint of good vinegar to a 
quart of syrup, and let it cover the peaches. 

SPICED CURRANTS. 

Seven pounds of currants ; four pounds of brown 
sugar ; six teaspoonfuls of cinnamon ; six teaspoon- 
fuls of cloves ; one pint of vinegar. Dissolve the 
vinegar and sugar ; then put the currants and spices 
in, and let them boil up once or twice, till the cur- 
rants look a little curly. Put them in glass bottles ; 
stop very tight. 

SPANISH PICKLE. 

Take one peck of small green tomatoes (the 
smaller the better) ; slice them rather thin ; lay 
them into a stone jar, in a layer about one inch 
thick ; sprinkle in a little salt, then a layer of to- 
matoes, then salt, and so on. Let them stand over 
night ; turn off the water, and put the tomatoes into 



MAKING PICKLES. 277 

a preserving-kettle; cover them with good cider 
vinegar ; let this boil up once. Slice four ounces 
of horse-radish ; two ounces each of black and white 
mustard-seed and celery-seed ; one ounce of black 
pepper ; a teaspoonful of red pepper ; three quarters

gether while your pickle is hot ; put it into a stone , 
jar ; cover tight, and keep it in a cool place. 

PICKLED WALNUTS. 

Pick the walnuts when green and soft ; prick 
them well with a fork. Boil four pounds of salt to 
a gallon of water ; strain it clear ; put the walnuts 
into a firkin or stone jar ; turn the brine on them 
boiling hot ; let them stand two or three days in the 
sun if you can ; then drain them into a basket. 
Put the nuts back into the jar. Boil as much cider 
vinegar as will cover the pickles ; to every gallon, 
add half an ounce of whole cloves, three ounces of 
horse-radish, half an ounce of mustard-seed tied up 
in a little bit of muslin ; when all is boiling, turn 
it on to the nuts. Cover them tight. In two weeks 
they will be ready for use. 

MABTINOES. 

Wipe them clean, and put them into a firkin. 
Put one quart of coarse strong salt to a pail of 
water ; boil and skim it, until the salt is all melted ; 
put this on to the martinoes, and let it stand two 
days and nights; then drain them off; wash out tlie 

24

278 MAKING PICKLES* 

firkiQ, and put the martinocs into it. Put to boil 
enough vinegar to cover them, and with it a small 
bag of cloves and allspice ; turn the vinegar over tho 
pickles boiling hot, and cover them closely. In two 
weeks they will be fit to eat, but better in two 
months. 

MIKED PICKLES. 

Break up a cauliflower, very tender string beans, 
and some very small onions ; a red pepper cut in 
small pieces ; some little long greea pepper, and 
some little yellow tomatoes ; scald them in salt and 
water, and let them stand twenty-four hours. Drain 
them from that, and put them into a jar or pan ; 
turn boiling vinegar over them ; let them stand 
until cool enough to put into glass bottles ; stop them 
tight. 

In making pickles, the articles must be fresh- 
gathered, and use the best of cider vinegar, or you 
cannot have good pickles. 

PICKLED MACKEREL. 

Take four dozen of small mackerel (what axe 
called tinkers) ; cut them open a little way to clean 
them, and wash them in salt and water ; lay them 
into a baking-pan. Sprinkle a plenty of fine salt, 
pepper, cloves, and allspice ; add vinegar enough to 
bake them in. Bake them about fifteen minutes ; 
lay them into a stone jar ; sprinkle a little salt 
between each layer. Have on the fire vinegar 
enough to cover the mackerel, with whole cloves and 



^' 



HOSIE-UADE WINS. 279 

allspice. When all the fish are baked and in the 
jar, turn the vinegar over them ; cover them tight. 
These are very nice to use as you would sardines for 
lunch. 

POTTED MACKEREL. 

Place a layer of small fish in a stone jar ; then 
sprinkle salt, whole peppers, cloves, and allspice; 
then a layer of fish, and so on till the jar is nearly 
full. Then cover with vinegar, and put a paper over 
the top of the jar, and a paste made of rye meal. 
Bake it slowly four hours. Take off the crust ; do 
not allow any of it to fall into the fish ; keep covered 
close. These will keep six months. 



HOME-MADE WINR 



PINE-APPLE CHAMPAGNE. 



Cut the rind off six good ripe pine-apples ; lay it 
into -a jar with one gallon of cold w^ter ; let it stand 
to ferment ; strain it ; sweeten it with loaf sugar to 
the taste. Bottle it, tie down the corks, and lay the 
bottles on the side. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

Put two quarts of raspberries into one quart of 
the best of wine vinegar ; let it stand in a cool place 
twenty-four hours ; strain it through a cloth to get 



^

280 HOME-MADE WINE. 

all the juice ; put it into a preserving-kettle, and 
when it almost boils skim it well, and add two 
pounds of loaf sugar ; dissolve it and skim it, then 
strain it. Bottle, and cork it tight ; it will keep a 
year. A spoonful of this in a glass of water is very 
cooling in summer. 

CURRANT WINE. 

Mash and squeeze the currants through a coarse 
strong cloth. To a gallon of juice, add one quart 
of water, two pounds of good loaf sugar ; stir this, 
and set it away in a large stone pot ; let it stand two 
weeks. There will be a thick scum ; take this all 
off, and add one pint of good rum or brandy ; put it 
in a demijohn ; stop it tight. 

CHERRY BOUNCE. 

For ten gallons, have a ten gallon keg half full of 
the very best new rum; fill it full of black rum 
cherries fresh picked from the trees ; stop it tight. 
Let it stand until the next spring ; then drain off all 
the juice ; turn out the cherries ; put in two gallons 
of water, and let them soak until the next day. Put 
to the juice two pounds of loaf sugar to a gallon ; 
put it back into the keg. Wash out the cherries 
from the water, and strain it into the keg ; stop it 
tight ; let it stand until fall, and then bottle it. 

UiC brandy instead of rum if you prefer; but I 
think good rum is better than common brandy. 



HOM&MADE WINE. 281 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL. 

Place the berries in a kettle over the fire, with a 
very small quantity of water in the bottom of the 
kettle ; let them boil soft. Then strain them through 
a bag until the juice is all separated from the seed. 
Put the juice on the fire again, and sweeten to the 
taste with white sugar ; throw in a little bag of stick 
cinnamon. Let it boil twenty minutes or half an 
hour; take it off, and stir in the brandy or whiskey, 
making it as strong as desired. Bottle, and seal it 
with wax. 

If it is desired to make jam as well as cordial, 
merely dip or pour off the juice, not quite all, from 
the stewed berries. Then add a little water and 
sugar (brown if you please), and stew them down 
for jam. 

GINGER CORDIAL. 

Pour pounds of red or white currants ; half pound 
of bruised ginger ; two ounces of bitter almonds ; 
the juice of three lemons, and the rind of one lemon. 
Put the above into a gallon of whiskey ; let it stand 
ten days ; then strain it twice, and add five pounds 
of white sugar. Bottle it for use. 

GINGER BEER. 

Two ounces of ginger ; one pint of molasses ; half 
a pint of good yeast; one gallon of warm water. 
Put this into a stone jug ; shake it up well ; set it to 
rise for twelve hours ; then stop it tight, or bottle it. 

24* 



282 MISGELLANEOtrS. 

DANDGUON BEEB. 

To a peck of dandelions, one pail of water ; put it 
into a pot to boil about two hours ; strain it into a 
jug or keg ; add one quart of molasses, and one 
pint of good yeast ; set it to rise twelve hours. Bot- 
tle it, and tie down the cork. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

LARDING. 

Larding is to cut salt pork in fine strips (you 
can find larding-needles at any kitchen furnishing 
store). You can see by that how thick the strips 
are to be, as they are to be put into the needle, and 
drawn through the meat about an inch apart, and 
one inch long. 

CRUMBS FOB SMALL BIRDS. 

Lay some fine crumbs into a baking-pan ; set them 
In the oven ; stir them often until a light brown. 
Take the pan from the oven ; add a little butter, 
stirring all the time until the crumbs have absorbed 
the butter, and look dry. Sprinkle these over any 
kind of small birds, and round them. They garnish 
the dish sufficiently. 



MISCELLANEOUS* 283 

A NICE BROWNING. 

Put a pound of sugar into a saucepan ; let it 
melt, as if to make candy, and brown ; then add a 
pint of water ; stir it for about ten minutes. Turn 
this into a bottle, and stop it tight, and use it instead 
of soy to brown soups or gravies. 

CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

Take half a pound of chestnuts ; break off the 
shells ; turn on to the nuts a quart of boiling water ; 
let it stand ten minutes ; take off the brown skins. 
Put the nuts into a saucepan with a pint of white 
stock ; let them boil an hour and a half, or until soft 
enough to mash through a sieve ; then add a little 
lemon, cayenne, and half a pint of cream; let it 
simmer, but not boil, stirring all the time until 
served. 

CHESTNUT DRESSING FOR TURKEY. 

Boil the chestnuts, peel them, mash them fine, 
and season them the same as dressing made of bread 
crumbs. The French chestnuts are less trouble 
because larger, but no better than any other. 

EGG SAUCE FOR FISH. 

Boil four eggs hard ; drop them into cold water ;

USEFUL HINTS. 285 



USEFXJL fflNTS. 

• 

A. COOK should always, when setting away what is 
h$Tt from dinner, be careful to put each meat by 
itself on a clean dish, and put the gravy with it, in 
order that she may be able to make a nice dish of 
what cold meats she has ; for it is very great economy 
to make a relishing dish of what she has left, without 
as much expense as a plain dish would cost Some 
cooks think they must have all kinds of sauces to 
season a made dish ; but every dish is better to taste 
well of whatever it is made of, without the disguise 
of spices and sauces. I like a bright seasoning of 
onions and vegetables, a little spice, and some sauce, 
but not too much. We have so many vegetables, 
such as celery, parsley, mushrooms, besides so many 
dried sweet herbs, that we cannot be at a loss for 
good flavoring. But all these things must be used 
with good judgment. Some cooks use a great quan- 
tity of buttor, but their cooking is not so good as if 
they used it more prudently ; too much butter spoils 
everything. You should try out the fat of poultry, 
and keep eadh kind by itself to baste with. 

Pieces of stale bread should be kept clean and dry. 
Every two or three days put all the small pieces you 
have on a tin sheet, and set it in the oven with the 
door open to dry. When very dry, pound them fine, 
and sift them through a coarse sieve or fine cul- 



286 USEFUL HINTS, 

lender. The fine crumbs are good to use in frying ; 
the coarse ones are good for puddings. The soft part 
of pieces of bread should be used for dressing for 
meats, which would save cutting a whole loaf for 
that purpose. If care is taken of the pieces of bread 
in a family, a great saving may be made, for bread 
is a large item in family expenses. Soft crackers 
pounded make the best crumbs to use in frying, also 
in scalloping oysters. 

The dripping of beef and pork, clarified, is very 
nice to fry in, instead of lard or butter. To clarify 
it, put the drippings into an iron pot ; to a quart of 
fat allow half a pint of cold water ; let it boil until 
the water is boiled out, which may be known by its 
not bubbling. When the water has evaporated, 
strain it into an earthen pot, and keep it in a cool 
place for use. 

The fat from soup stock, and all other fat that 
with proper care accumulates in a kitchen, may be 
used for making soft soap with but very little trouble, 
and a great saving may be made thereby, as it is 
much better than the soap that you get in exchange 
for your house grease. 

ON ROASTING MEAT. 

When roasting meat, have a clear good fire ; set 
the tin-kitchen back from the fire; turn the spit 



USEFUL mNTS. 287 

often uutil tbo meat gets hot ; then baste with the 
drippings from it, or the fat of the same kind of meat 
that has been clarified, for if you are not particular 
in this you cannot preserve the true flavor of the 
meat. 

Veal may be basted with a little butter for the last 
basting before dishing, as for poultry ; but beef and 
mutton with its own dripping from the tin-kitchen. 
Dredge on a little salt and a little flour, and baste 
well about twenty minutes before dishing, and tho 
meat will have a rich brown frothy appearance. 

FOB BESTOBING MEAT. 

If a little spoiled, lay into a pan ; turn over it 
some good vinegar, rubbing it all over. Let it lay 
one hour ; then wash it out of this ; lay into cold 
Water for one hour ; wipe it dry ; cook it. It will 
be perfectly sweet. 

TO SAVE COOKING FAT. 

Beef, pork, and veal drippings, that is, what you 
turn out of tin-kitchen or meat pan (leaving the last 
drippings to make the gravy for your meats, as I 
have before directed), that is fat. This you keep 
all together in a jar. Once a week put it into a 
saucepan ; add half a pint of cold water. Let it 
boil about twenty minutes, and then strain it into a 
jar. This is very good to use as you would butter, 
or to fry in cooking. 



288 USEFUL HINTS. 

TO SAVE SOAP GREASE, 

Keep a small earthen pot near the sink when you 
wash dishes ; scrape every little bit of fat into it. 
Every day scrape this into a large pot until you get 
it full ; put this into a pot with a pint of cold water, 
and let it boil. Keep the pot covered tight, that 
you may not get the scent of it through the house. 
Keep an old cullender over the top of a firkin where 
the grease is melted; turn it into the cullender. 
When the grease is strained out, put the rough 
grease into another firkin. This clean grease is 
what you may make soft soap with. The rough 
grease sells for six cents per pound, if you do not 
wish to make «oap ; the clean grease may be sold 
for nine cents per pound. You perceive by this lit- 
tle care and trouble, your soap grease is worth half 
as much again as if it was all put into the firkin 
together. 

TO MAKE SOFT SOAP. 

Take seventeen pounds of potash to twenty of 
grease; lay the potash at the bottom of the barrel. 
Boil the grease, and pour it on ; put in two pailfuls 
of scalding water, and stir it all together. Fill up 
the barrel the next morning with cold water ; stir it 
up from time to time, and in three days it will bo 
fit for use. 

ANOTHER SOFT SOAP. 

This answers for common purposes, but not so 
good for clothes as the former : —

water ; two spoonfuls of flour into a cup of water 5 
mix it smoothly, and stir into the boiling sugar and 
water; put in a piece of butter about the size of 
an egg ; give it one boil, and add two spoonfuls of 
good vinegar and a little cinnamon or nutmeg.

DIRECTIONS FOR A YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER 

As much of the comfort of a household depends 
upon the state of the kitchen department, I will 
endeavor to aid the young housekeeper in making 
her arrangements* 

Presuming that a range is in the kitchen, with the 
usual quantity of utensils fitted into it, it is quite 
as necessary to have other articles to be used upon 
it, such as copper saucepans, well lined, with covers, 
from three to six different sizes ; a flat-bottomed 
soup-pot J an upright gridiron ; sheet-iron breadpana 
instead of tin; a griddle; a tin kitchen; Hector's 
double boiler; a- tin coffee-pot for boiling coffee, or 
a filter — either being equally good ; a tin canistei 
to keep roasted and ground coffee in ; a canister for 
tea ; a covered tin box for bread ; one likewise for 
cake, or a drawer in your store-closet, lined with 
zinc or tin ; a bread-knife ; a board to cut bread 
upon ; a covered jar for pieces of bread, and one 
for fine crums; a knife-tray; a spoon-tray; — the 
yellow ware is much the strongest, or tin pans of 
different sizes are economical; — a stout tin pan for 
mixing bread ; a large earthen bowl for beating 
cake ; a stone jug for yeast ; a stone jar for soup 
stock; a meat-saw; a cleaver; iron and wooden 
spoons; a wire sieve for sifting flour and meal; a 
small hair sieve ; a bread-board ; a meat-board ; a 
Ugnum-vitdd mortar, and rolling-pin, Ac. 

Fit your kitchen table with brown table-oloths, or

oiLcloth, and suitable dishes, to induce your cook 
to have her table in good order for the servants ; 
half a dozen rollers, one dozen dish-towels, one 
dozen towels for glasses, dish-cloths hemmed, coarse 
cloths and holders for the range. Keep a small jar 
near the sink, to be sure to save. all the scraps of 
'grease, and once a week boil it up and strain it into 
a firkin; and when you have obtained twenty 
pounds, you can make a barrel of soft soap ; painted 
covered pails and boxes, for all kinds of groceries, 
in the store-closet, so that when anything is brought 
inte the house, it may be put into its proper place 
at once (for if it is put into the closet, in a paper 
bag, it seldom finds its way there); a large tin 
spice-box, or small wooden ones marked for the di& 
ferent spices ; a good painted cover for flour-barrel ; 
a large ice-chest for the cellar, for meats, butter, 
Ac. ; a keg or half-barrel, half filled with good brine 
for salt pork ; one also for salt beef; boxes or has* 
kets for vegetables, which one can easily move when 
sweeping. 

For the washroom, have a place for tubs, pails, 
and baskets ; bags or baskets, for clothes-pins and 
clothes-lines; clothes-horses, large and small; a 
dumb-betty is the best machine in use for washing ; 
an ironing blanket and sheet; a dress-board and 
bosom-board, well covered. 

When the girls have done washing, all the tubs 
and pails should be washed clean and put in their 
proper places, and the wash-room cleaned before th« 
clothes are brought in for folding. 



820 DIBEOTIONB FOB A TOUNG HOUSIXEEPEB. 

See that your store-closet and larder are filled 
with all that is necessary, and then make it a nile 
with your servants, that before any of the different 
articles should be used up, they should report to 
the mistress, as it is very inconvenient, when mak- 
ing preparations for a dinner or other meal, to wait 
until you can replenish whatever is wanted. 

When you have everything arranged, you should 
make it a rule with yourself and servants to keep 
everything clean and in its place ; and therefore it 
is b^st to have a fixed time to perform every duty. 
You must begin systematically yourself, if you 
expect it of others. The best time to arrange your 
household for the day is directly after break&st. 
Consult with your cook ; provide what is wanted 
for dinner. If you have anything left of the day 
before, that will help make it out, arrange it with 
her then. Give your orders decidedly and dis- 
tinctly ; — and now is the best time to say what you 
will have for tea and breakfast, and if anything is to 
be prepared over night for the next day's dinner, as 
this gives the cook time to make all her arrange- 
ments without haste, and leaves the mistress free 
from annoyance the remainder of the day. The 
cook should have regular days, after washing and 
ironing are over, for cleaning her closets, tins, and 
larder, sweeping out her cellar, cleaning her entries 
and cellar-stairs. 

The chambermaid should have her days for wash- 
ing and ironing, sweeping, cleaning windows, silver

Ac. In this way yonr house will be kept in order ; 
everything will be done well and in time. 

The morning is the best time to work; therefore 
if yonr servants know just what they have to do^ 
and if they are faithful, they will set themselves 
about their work earlier than if they were obliged 
to wait for their orders each day ; and each servant 
should know exactly what is expected of them, and 
if left undone, the responsibility will rest with them 
alone. 

If a servant omits his or her duty, it is best to 
speak of it at once, for perhaps they can give a sat- 
isfactory excuse for not having done it; if not, 
reprove them quietly and firmly. If this method 
should be adopted when you first take a servant 
into your employ, in nine cases out of ten you will 
have a good servant in the end; but if you let 
faults pass without reproof, after a time servants 
become careless; you become impatient, change, 
and often do not improve the matter. 

Servants should be treated kindly, but with deci- 
sion. Let them feel that you have confidence in 
them, and that you are careful that every inmate of 
your household is comfortable and well taken care 
of, and that you expect them, in return, to make 
you comfortable by doing their duty promptly and 
cheerfully. When this is understood, more interest 
will be found among servants,, and they will have 
ftdJ credit for their faithfulness. 

Be careAil not to suspect a servant's honesty 
without a good reason for doing so ; for their chav^

acter may be all they have to depend on. But ii 
they are untruthful or dishonest, tell them so plainly 
as it may be the means of saving them from de> 
struction. Be sure that you are truthful with them. 
Be ready to give them a just character when called 
upon. It is a mistaken kindness to keep back a 
servant's real &ults, and a want of candor to the 
person to whom you give their character. If they 
leave, or you send them away for some particular 
fancy of your own, do not prejudice any other person 
against them, for every one does not require tbo 
same services of a servant.

▼ide for, meats that are left from the pailor dimier 
can be served very nicely and to advantage. 

Pieces of cold roast beef laid into a pie-dish with 
a little of the gravy, a dozen tomatoes peeled and 
cut up, then another layer of beef, some nice mashed 
potatoes spread over the top about an inch thick, 
brushed over with egg, set in the oven and browned, 
make a nice, healthy dish. 

A quart of white soup stock, with some tomatoes 
stewed in, and strained to take out the seeds and 
skins ; a cup of rice boiled in this until the soup is 
absorbed ; then some pieces of any kind of tender 
meat put in and covered with rice ; cover the sauce- 
pan tight, and let it stand until the meat is hot. This 
makes a very nice dinner for children. 

Veal minced fine, and warmed with a little butter, 
is nice, if well prepared, to eat with potatoes. 

Fresh fish and potatoes, chopped fine and warmed 
with a little butter, is nice. 

Children are generally very fond of baked beans, 
but they should be very well cooked to be good. 

Any kind of tender meat warmed for a child's 
dinner should not be fried, but heated in a manner 
to keep it moist and tender. Meat or poultry, put 
into a saucepan with a little salt, very little pepper, 
a little butter, and a cup of water, and boiled up, is 
very nice. Rice, macaroni, and vermicelli, are very 
nice, boiled with the meat, for children.

RECEIPTS FOR A PARM-HOUSE 

I give here a few receipts for a gentleman's farn> 
house, or where there are many servants employed 

Monday. — A leg of pork boiled about four hours 
greens of any kind, cabbage-sprouts or beet-tops, 
and potatoes. A good dish of Indian mush and 
molasses. 

Tuesday. — Fried fish, A good cod or haddock, 
cut in nice-shaped pieces, and rolled in Indian meal; 
fry out some salt pork ; add some nice drippings ; 
fry the fish a light brown. Potatoes, pickles, or 
horseradish. For dessert, apple dumplings. 

Wednesday. — Boiled calf's head. Soak a calf's 
head in cold water one hour. Put it to boil, with 
two pounds of rather lean salt pork, in six quarts of 
water; let it boil three or four hours. Take a piece 
of the lights and brains ; chop them all together ; 
put into a saucepan with a quart of the liquor the 
head was boiled in, a little flour, butter, pepper, and 
salt ; give it one boil ; add half a cup of vinegar ; 
dish the head, liver, lights, tongue, and heart, 
all together ; turn the gravy over them. Potatoes 
and parsnips. For dessert, a minute pudding. Put 
two quarts of milk to boil; when boiled, stir in 
flour until it is as thick as batter pudding ; turn it 
into a bowl that has been rinsed with cold milk, to 
prevent the pudding from adhering to it; let it 
stand five minutes ; turn it into a disK. Served 
with sweet sauce. 



CLEANINO. 289 

Take three pots of concentrated Ijre (it comes in 
little tin pots) ; take off the tops, and put them in a 
kettle that will hold three pailfuls ; add eight pounds 
of good grease, and two pailfuls of water ; let it boil 
until all the lye melts out of the cans. Put tliis into 
the soap barrel, and fill it up with hot water. This 
is much cheaper than potash soap. 



CLEANING. 



TO CLEAN HABBLE. 



Take a little soft soap and pumice-stone on a 
flannel ; rub it all over, then wash it off, wipe dry, 
and rub it with a clean cloth. But if it is spotted, 
send it to be repolished. 

TO CLEAN FUBNITUBE. 

For polished furniture : an equal quantity of 
spirits of turpentine, sweet oil, and beeswax, melted 
together. Wipe all the dust off; then rub some of 
this mixture on to a good, stout piece of woollen 
cloth ; rub the article well, and then polish it with 
some old soft silk. For Tarnished furniture : wipe 
the spots with a soft wet cloth; wipe them dry. 
Then with a piece of cotton flannel dipped in a little 
sweet oil, wipe the article ; rub it clean with old 
silk.

Wash them first wlfli warm water and a sponge ; 
then dry them with old Imen, and rub tiiem clear. 
Polish tiiem with old newspaper. 

When cutting up old linen sheets, I take the best 
pieces, about the size of a towel, turn down the edge, 
and run it with a long stitch. It does not take long 
to do this, and it makes nice window cloflis because 
not linty. 

GLBANINO PAINT. 

With warm water, a Kttle soda, soap, and very fine 
pumice-stone and a flannel cloth, rub the paint all 
over; then rinse off the soap well, and wipe it dry. 
Always in cleaning paint rub up and down, not 
crosswise Of round and round. 

CLEANING fflLYEQ PI4ATS. 

Take some good fine whiting wet with water (or 
if much tarnished, use alcohol) ; rub the article all 
over with a »oft cloth dipped in the whiting (use a 
sofk brush fbr the chased work) ; let it dry. Thea^ 
have some hot watw with silver soap, or good so^ 
soap ; with a soft cloth wash off the wMtiiig, and 
with a dean brush wash the whiting out of the 
chased work, and wipe quite dry with a clean old 
soft cloth while hot out of the waters Nothing will 
make silver look as well, and keep cleans as longw 

In cutting up old table clotiis, I h^mb the best 
pieces for wiping silver. The oldest are better f&t 
cleaning it than a sponge.

it run through until t^e grease is out, and then rub 
it dry with a cloth. 

GLEANINa STBAW CARPETS. 

Sprinkle a little Indian meal over the carpet; 
with a flannel cloth and warm water wash the carpet 
clean, and wipe it dry. Do not use much water, 
nor wash straw carpets often, for it softens the stmw. 
They do not wear as well as when wiped over with 
a damp cloth. 

CLEANING SILK. 

One cup of alcohol ; one cup of soft soap ; one cup 
of water; half a cup of molasses; mix this well 
together. With a flannel cloth or nice sponge wipe 
the silk over on both sides ; then with a hot iron 
press it very smooth on the side you' intend to make 
the wrong side. I have only tried this on black 
silk ; it gives it a gopd color and stifihess.

CHILDREN'S TABLS. 

Where there is a family of children, it is desirable 
they should have their meals at an equal division of 
the time of the day i therefore^ if they breakfast at 
seven^ dine between twelve and one, and take tea 
at si^i it is much better for them than late dinners^ 
Children are much better if not allowed to eat at 
aQ times in the day^ If they require anything 
Detweej^ meals, let what they Imve be very simple, 
such a0. an appl^i crackeri or a piece of bread and 
butter ; then they have w appetite for their dinner. 
Their digestive organs should not be kept always 
at work^ If children are allowed to eat at all hours 
in the day^ their stoixtach soon gets out of order, as 
^ natural consequence^ Their food should be good, 
plain, tender meats well cooked* Cooks are rather 
apt to be careless with this early dinner, if not made 
to understand that it is of the utmost importance that 
children should be very well taken care of. Inter^

Cook Books.— We believe most devoutly in this 
class of literature, and feel in duty bound to buy 
every one that issues from a practical housekeeper. 
There are ten or fifteen cook nooks in our kitchen 
library, and all of them are used at one time or 
another. Amonf these most frequently consulted 
are Jennie June's, Mrs. Putnam's, Marion Harland's 
Miss Beecher's, and the Philosophy of Housekeeping. 
All these works are from the pen of women who 
know bow with their own hands to make the best 
of bread, pies, cake, preserves and delicacies, and 
are now or nave been accustomed to doing it as a 
regular thing. " Housekeeperi" will get her money's 
worth in any one of- the works named, t" Mrs. Ran- 
dolph's Virginia Housewife," is probably out of 
print, as we nave tried in vain to procure a copy. 
The recipes in that book are unsurpassed, and trust- 
worthy in every particular.

This little book is the result' of townty years' experience, 
on the part of the authot in ' housekeeping. The receipts! 
whicli it contains were, in ^reat part, ^i^inally written down 
for tier own convenience ; others from time to time have bean 
a<^Jed, with the hope that they might be of service to * her . 
daughters. 'She has been led to suppose that they might be . 
made useful to others also'; and for this reason, with the 
advice and encouragement of those on whom she ought to .rely, 
they are now published. . \ ' ' 

Without comparing this book with any other works of & 
similar character, it is thought that it proposes the three fol- % 
lowing characteristics : 

1. It contains no receipt which the author has not herself 
tyed and proved, experimentally, to be good. 

2. It contains a sufficient number of receipts to meet all 
• the ordinary wants of a family. ' * . 
, 3. A third object kept constantly in view has 'been ip prp- 

• vide receipts which will enable one to furnish a table hand- 
somely, at the smallest expense. 
t Great attention has been given to the last point. "Few per* 

sons are aware what a difference the mode ot cooking makes \ 
in the cost of a year's housekeeping. Without any increase 
of expenditure, one person, by means of good receipts skil- 
fully used, and by a tasteful arrangement of the table, will

XV PREFACE. 



make a feast out of the articles of food which would have 
hardly sufficed another for the most indifferent meal. There 
are housekeepers whose table, notwithstanding great extrava- 
gance, is always disorderly and uninviting. They do not 
know how to make use of tneir materials, and they never get 
beyoad a coarse, uninviting abundance. There are others 
who, with the cheapest materials and with very limited means, 
through good taste, good judgment, and good cooking, have 
always a table richly aJd handsomely furnished. 

In this, and in other respects,; the intention has been to 
prepare a work for practical use^ One of the greatest con- 
veniences to a young housekeeper is a Cook Book, on the 
excellence of whose directions she may rely ; while few things 
embarrass her more than one which is filled, not with a selec- 
tion, but with an indiscriminate collection, of receipts, good, 
bad, and indifferent, brought together hap-hazard, without any 
reference to their real value. . This book has at least the 
negative merit of containing nothing inserted merely to swell 
the size of the volume ; and it is believed that it may claim 
the positive merit of containing good and economical rules, 
sufficient to meet any wants which are likely to occur in the 
common round of a housekeeper's life. 



PREFACE 



TO THE IMPKOVED EDITION. 



Eight years have elapsed since. I published the 
Grst edition of this volume of receipts. Encaur- 
aged by the very favorable reception it met with, 
and having been frequently solicited to enlarge it, 
I have added largely to the number and variety of 
the receipts, and have changed such as a longer 
experience showed to be susceptible of improve- 
ment. For the purpose of aiding young house- 
keepers, a few bills of fare have been given ; also, 
some suggestions with regard to furnishing the 
kitchen, and other domestic matters. 

Trusting that this work may meet the approba- 
tion of housekeepers, I respectfully submit it tc 
their candid consideration.

DIRECTIONS FOR A YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER, 



ILLUSTRATIONS. 



A Surloin Of Beef— Should be cut from point to but-end, 
in rather thin slices, and the tenderloin in the same way, serving 
some of the fat with the lean meat. If the bone at the bur-end 
could be removed before it ia cooked, it would greatly iaciliiata 
the operation of carving. 



A Fillet of Beef or Teal. — Cut off a slice from the top 

about half an inch thick, and then begin to help in long thin 
Bikes, with a little of the fat and stuffing.

A Tongue — Should be cut across, nearly through the middle, 

and thin slices taken from each side. A portion of the fat, which 
is situated at the root of the tongue, being helped if desired. 



A Boasted Leg of Mutton — Should be cut from the 

thick part of the (high first, in rather thin slices, to the bone. 
After that, turn the whole piece orer in the dish, and cut straight 
to the bone, observing the same angle, which cuts the meat across 
Hie grain, as all meats should be cut in course of earring. 

A Leg of Boiled Mutton — Should be cut in rather thin 
ulices through the thickest part to the bone. Helped with a por-

the inner side down. Commence carving by cutting to the bone 
half way down the thigh, and then turn the end of the dish, with 
the point of the leg towards you ; then draw your knife to the 
bone lengthwise about the middle, serving slices from each side 
outwards. 




A Goose Roasted. — Remove the joints in the same way as 
described for the turkey, leaving the entire breast ; then draw the 
knife straight along the breast-bone the entire length of the meat, 
and straight in to the bone ; serving outwardly, and with parts of 
the meat from the thigh. The meat on the drumstick of a goose 
is by some persons preferred to the breast. 



A Roast Duck — Should be carved the same as the goose, 
making allowances for the difference in the size of the birds. 



RECEIPTS. 



PLAIN BREAD AND CAKE 

YEAST. 

One handful of hops, boiled half an hour in two 
quarts of water ; ten good potatoes, boiled half an 
nour, and mashed very fine. Strain the water from 
the hops on to the potatoes, very hot ; stir in two 
table-spoonfuls of salt, and one pint of flour ; set it 
to cool. When lukewarm add one pint of good 
brewer's yeast, and let it rise six hours. Strain at 
through a cullender or sieve ; put into a stone jug 
stopped tight. It will keep three weeks in winter 
and one week in summer. 

BREAD. 

Three quarts of flour ; half a cup of yeast ; one 
lable-spoonful of salt ; warm water enough to make 
it into dough. Knead this until it is perfectly 
smooth. Be sure to get all the flour off the sides 
of the pan ; set it in a warm place to rise at night ; 
in the morning knead the dough well, divide it into 
two loaves, put it into the pans, set it in a warm

place to rise about an hour. Bake it in a tolerably 
hot oven about three quarters of an hour.* 

A pint of Indian meal, scalded, and mixed in wilh 
the flour, is by some persons considered an improve- 
ment, but it will require one hour to bake. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

Pour quarts of unbolted wheat, a teacupful of 
good yeast, half a cup of molasses, and one table- 
spoonful of salt, mixed with warm water enough to 
make a stiff dough ; let it rise six or eight hours ; 
wet your hands in cold water to put it into the pans ; 
let it rise in the pans an hour, or until it rises an 
inch ; bake about two hours. It should be very well 
baked. 

THIRD BREAD. 

One pint of rye meal ; one pint of Indian meal ; 
one pint of wheat flour ; half a cup of yeast ; one 
spoonful of salt ; mix it up with warm water into a 
stiff dough; set it to rise eight hours. Bake it 
either in loaves or biscuit. Wet the hands in cold 

* All kinds of raised bread or cake rise much quicker in a kitchen 
in the daytime, when the kitchen is warm, than at night, when the 
fire is out. Therefore, five or six hours in the day are equal to twelve 
at night. In winter anything made with yeast should be made 
early in the evening, that it may get started to rise before the kitchen 
is cold. I keep a piece of an old ironing-blanket, kept clean, to fold 
and lay over the cotton or linen bread-cloth, to keep the bread warm 
while rising

thick ; cut it into small biscuits, and bake them 
twenty minutes. 

DINNER ROLLS. 

The dough made as above. Cut your dough with 
a small biscuit-cutter, that your rolls may be all of 
one size ; knead them with your fingers, turning the

small ; put them close together in the pan, that they 
may not spread too large. Bake about twenty 
minutes.

BROWN OR WHITE BREAD BREWIS.

an iron saucepan ; put in a table-spoonful of salt, a 
piece of butter as large as an egg, some milk ; sim- 
mer it slowly until it is tender. 



SOUPS. 



SOUP-STOCK, ETC. 



Salt should be rubbed on to meat for making 
rfoups, and the meat be put into cold water, as 
the salt and heating the meat gradually extract its 
juices. Great care should be taken to skim all kinds 
of soup, particularly those made from fresh meats ; 
the scum rises very thick just before the soup be- 
gins to boil ; then is the proper time to skim it. 

STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP. 

Put two knuckles or shins of veal, two onions, 
and two table-spoonfuls of salt, into eight quarts of 
water ; boil this six hours ; strain it into a stone jar ; 
keep it in a cool place ; when it is cold, take off" the 
fat. The stock of white soups should be seasoned 
with white pepper, salt, a little mace, onions, celery 



SOUPS. 11 

and other vegetables, not fried, as it is desirable to 
preserve the soup as white as possible. When lemon 
or wine is to be added, it should be put into the tu- 
reen, and hot soup turned on to it ; for, if put into 
the soup and boiled, a great part of the flavor is lost. 

BROWN STOCK. 

Take two shins of beef, one of veal, one dozen 
cloves, one dozen pepper-corns, two table-spoonfuls 
of salt, and eight quarts of water ; boil this eight 
hours ; strain it into a stone pot ; when cold, remove 
the fat. 

This is a very nice stock for brown soups, or to 
use instead of water in making gravy for any kind 
of dark meats, such as beef, mutton, venison, or 
any kind of wild fowl. All kinds of brown soup 
are better to have a piece of butter, a little flour, 
and onion, browned in the soup-pot, before the water 
or stock is put in. Cloves, allspice, India soy, walnut 
catsup, in fact any kind of dark flavoring or spice, 
may be used in dressing meats and soups brown. 

If you wish brown or white soup particularly 
clear, after taking off the fat, put it to boil ; beat 
up two eggs with the shells; stir them into the 
soup ; let it boil half an hour ; take it from the fire ; 
add a pint of cold water ; let it stand half an hour ; 
then strain it. This will give you a very clear soup. 
Then add vermicelli or macaroni ; boil it about 
twenty minutes. 

The meat that has been boiled for soup makes a 



12 RECEIPTS. 

very nice mince, when well seasoned, and warmed 
with a little of the fat taken from the stock. 

There should not be any vegetable put into soup* 
stock to keep, as it will cause the soup to turn sour. 

Onions, carrots, and celery, are good vegetables 
for all kinds of soup ; tomatoes have become a favor- 
ite vegetable; the flavor is a great improvement to 
almost all kinds of meat and fish ; therefore, if liked, 
this vegetable can be added to any kind of dish, 
either as a vegetable or as flavoring. If soup is to 
be strained, merely cut the tomatoes up, and put 
them in with other vegetables ; if not, boil them a 
little, and strain them, before putting them into the 
soup. 

ON BOILING MEATS. 

,111 kinds of fresh meats, intended for the table, 
should be put into boiling water, thereby retaining 
the juices. If you wish to give a, salt flavor to 
them, boil a piece of salt pork in the water before 
putting the meat in. A nice piece of boiled salt 
pork is a great addition to all kinds of boiled meats. 

Corned, salt, or smoked meats should be put into 
cold water to cook. Great care should be taken to 
skim the scum off well just before the water boils ; 
for if the thick scum boils into the water, it is im- 
possible to take it all off, and it will adhere to the 
meats. 

Some persons, in boiling a leg of mutton . for din* 
ner, add rice and vegetables to make a soup. la 
doing this, both are spoiled; the mutton is too 



soups. 13 

much cooked, and has the flavor of the vegetables, 
and the soup is too fat. My plan is to boil a leg of 
mutton, weighing ten pounds, about an hour and a 
half. [To dress it for dinner, see Boiled Mutton.] 
Set away the water the mutton is boiled in until 
next day ; then take off all the fat ; put the liquor 
into the soup-pot with the bones of the mutton, 
a cup of rice, carrots, turnips, and onions, and 
pieces of the mutton; boil it two hours. This 
makes a nice mutton broth. If more of the mutton 
is left than is required to make soup, you can have 
a nice mince, or a mutton pie. 

Any kind of boiled meat is much better served 
in the same manner, and the water and bones used 
for soup the next day. 

If your soup is not very rich with the meat, add

haddock weighing four pounds ; cut them in pieces 
about six inches square, wash them clean, and wipe 
them dry, and dredge them with a little flour ; cut 
into slices about a quarter of a pound of salt pork 
and two onions ; fry the pork a nice brown in a

the onion, a few bits of pork, a little pepper and 
salt ; dredge in some flour, and, if you like the 
flavor, put in a little tomato, then another layer of 
fish, and then the seasoning, and continue this until 
the fish and seasoning are all in the pot ; split eight 
hard crackers, dip them into cold water, and lay them 
over the fish ; put in hot water enough to cover the 
fish, and after it begins to boil, let it boil thirty 
mmutes. Some like half milk and half water ; if 



28 RECEIPTS. 

milk is used, the tomato should be omitted; fof 
those who like spice, a little clove and mace, with a 
quart of red wine, is a great improvement. 

CUSK I LA CR^ME. 

Bub the fish well with salt ; put it into a kettle, 
with enough boiling water to cover it ; as soon as it 
boils put it on one side where it will just simmer ; 
let it stand for an hour ; then take it up, and draw 
out all the bones. Put one ounce of flour into a 
saucepan, to which add, by. degrees, one quart of 
cream or new milk, mixing it very smoothly ; then 
add the juice of one lemon, one onion chopped fine, 
a bunch of parsley, a little nutmeg, salt and pepper ; 
put this on the fire, stirring till it forms a thick 
sauce ; stir in a quarter of a pound of butter ; 
strain the sauce through a sieve ; put a little on a 
dish ; then lay the fish on to the dish, and turn the 
sauce over it ; beat to a froth the whites of six 
eggs, and spread over the whole ; set in the oven,

a very light color. This is a very handsome dish 
for company ; it is very nice without the eggs, but 
not so handsome. 

BOILED COD. 

The head and shoulders is considered the best to 
boil. Lay it into cold water, with a handful of salt 
and let it remain one hour ; then scrape and wash it

thirty minutes, or according to the size of the fish ; 
serve it with drawn butter, with two or three hard 
boiled eggs chopped fine, or oyster sauce. 

BAKED COD. 

A fish weighing six or eight pounds is a good size 
to bake ; it should be cooked whole to look well. 
Make a dressing of bread-crums, pepper, salt, pars- 
ley, and onion, and a little salt pork chopped fine ; 
mix this up with one egg, fill the body, sew it up, 
lay it into a large pan ; lay across it some strips of 
salt pork to flavor it ; put one pint of water and a 
little salt into the pan; bake it an hour and a half; 
baste it often with butter and flour ; dish the fish ; 
shake into the gravy a little flour, a little butter, 
and two spoonfuls of tomato or walnut catsup ; give 
it one boil, and turn it over the fish. 

BROILED SCBOD. 

Take a small cod, or the tail of a large one ; sprin- 
kle a little salt over it, and let it remain over night ; 
in the morning wash off the salt, and wipe it dry ; 
set the outside to the fire first, and let it broil 
gently half an hour ; when it is dished, rub it with 
a little butter and a very little pepper ; send it to 
the table very hot.

little flour or cracker-crums, and then put in an- 
other layer of fish and seasoning ; cover this tight, 
and let it simmer gently one hour; dish it very 
carefully, and turn the gravy over the fish. 

TO STEW HADDOCK IN ITS OWN LIQUOR. 

Take a haddock, split it open, and take the bone 
wholly out; then cut the fish into square pieces 
about the length of your finger ; take some pounded 
mace and cayenne mixed, and put it upon the pieces 
of fish with your fingers in spots not quite an inch 
apart upon the inside ; then butter the sides and 
bottom of a large stewpan, put the fish in skin side 
down, close together, but not one upon another. 
The pan must be cold when the fish is put in ; let 
it stew slowly about an houi and a quarter ; just 
before it is quite done, mix some butter and flour 
well together, add a glass of white wine, and, when 
well mixed, turn it into the pan, and let it boil about 
ten minutes ; when ready for serving, take the fish 
out carefully in a deep dish, the spiced side up, and 
pour the gravy over it. 

FRIED COD AND HADDOCK. 

Cut the fish in pieces about the size to help at 
table ; wash and wipe them dry ; roll thorn in Indian 
meal. Fry some pieces of salt pork ; take out the 
pork, and put into the frying-pan some lard ; when

brown ; dish it with the • fried pork ; serve with 
drawn butter in a sauce tureen. 

PRIED SMELTS.

them in salt and water, and let them remain an 
hour ; then wash them clean, and wipe them dry ;

cracker-crums in another plate ; put about two 
pounds of lard into the frying-pan, set it on the 
fire until it is very hot, dip the smelts into the egg 
roll them in the crums, and put them into the 
boiling fat; fry them a light brown; serve them 
hot, with drawn butter. 

PRIED PERCH. 

Skin them all but the heads ; prepare them the 
same #s smelts. They require a longer time to fry 
than smelts, being larger and thicker. 

Fresh cod's tongues, fried in the same way, are 
very nice. 

FRIED SALMON.. 

Cut the salmon into slices half an inch thick, 
shake some flour over them, and fry them in butter, 
or in sweet oil, or with egg and crums, as smelts. 

FRIED HALIBUT

32 RECEIPTS. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Salmon should be well cleansed, but not soaked 
in water; rub a little salt into the body; flour a 
cloth, and pin it up, and put it into boiling water. 
For a piece weighing six pounds, after it begins to 
boil, let it boil about half an hour. Serve it with 
drawn butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or lob- 
ster sauce. 

BROILED SALMON. 

it may be either cut in slices, as fried salmon, or 
split to the tail; broil it very quick, and when it is 
dished rub some butter over it. 

BOILED HALIBUT. 

Some like the tail best, but the next cut is nicest, 
and a much handsomer piece to dish. Eub a little 
Bait over it, and lay it in cold water a little while ; 
then wash it, and scrape it very clean ; put it into 
a floured cloth, and then into boiling water. A 
piece weighing eight pounds will require thirty- 
five minutes to cook. 

BROILED HALIBUT. 

The nape, corned, is the best piece for broiling. 
Wash it, and wipe it dry ; sprinkle a little flour over 
it ; put the outside to the fire first, and broil it mod- 
erately half an hour. When it is dished, spread a 
little butter and pepper over it. 



FISH. 33 

BROILED MACKEREL. 

Split it down the back ; sprinkle it with a little 
Bait at night ; the next morning wash off the salt,

fish. 

SALMON TROUT. 

Salmon trout are broiled or fried the same as 
mackerel. Serve it with fish sauce. 

TAUTOG, OR BLACK FISH. 

This fish is very hard to clean. Lay them in a 
pan, and pour boiling-hot water over them; then 
scrape them very hard until you get off* all the 
scales; then wash and clean them in cold water. 
Let them lie in palt and water a while. Make a 
dressing of bread-crums, pepper, salt, a little clove, 
a great deal of parsley, one onion, and a little salt 
Y jrk, chopped fine ; mix this all up with a little 
I utter ; then stuff the fish, and sew it up ; *put it

into an iron pan; lay some strips of salt pork over 
it to flavor it, dredge on a little flour, and put into 
the pan a pint of water and a pint of red wine ; 
set it into the oven of the range, and do not quite 
close the door; let it stew gently one hour and a 
half; baste it very often with the wine and butter. 
When the fish is done, thicken the gravy with a 
little flour and butter ; give it one boil, and turn it 
over the fish. 

TO STEW TAUTOG IN CLARET. 

Cut in small pieces one onion; fry it a nice 
brown; take out the onion; put in the fish; fry it

a little fat pork chopped fine, a plenty of parsley, 
pepper and salt, one egg, mixed well together, and 
stuff the body of the fish, and sew it up. Fry a very 
little pork a nice brown ; add half a teacup of hot 
water; lay the fish in; dredge it well with flour, 
put small pieces of butter on to the fish, and bake 
one hour ; baste it often ; dish the fish ; add a litt e 
more water and flour and butter; give it one boi ,

and turn it over the fish ; garnish it with slices of 
lemon, or horseradish grated. 

TO BROIL A BLUE FISH. 

Split it in the back ; set the skin side to the fire 
first ; when done, turn the other side ; a fish weigh- 
ing three pounds requires half an hour to broil; 
when dished, rub over it a little fresh butter, and 
very little pepper and salt. 

BLUE FISH, BOILED. 

A fish weighing seven pounds requires three 
quarters of an hour to boil it. Serve it with drawn 
butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or parsley ai\d 
butter. 

TURBOT. 

We have a flat white-fish brought to our market, 
very nearly the same as English turbot. To cook 
them, scrape them clean ; wash in salt and water ; 
wipe dry ; lay whole in a long pan ; dredge with a 
little salt and flour; sprinkle on a little ground 
mace ; pour over it a pint of red wine and a pint of 
water ; let it stew until done. A common-sized one 
bakes in about an hour. By putting a fish-drainer 
into the pan under the fish, you can serve it with- 
out breaking. Dish it on a long, flat dish. Braid a 
kittle flour into a quarter of a pound of butter ; stir 
it into the gravy with two spoonfuls of anchovy 
*auce or walnut catsup ; give it one boil ; turn it 
over the fish ; garnish it with lemon.

pepper, salt, and butter ; fill up the shad with the 
stuffing, sew it up, and lay into a baking-pan ; lay on 
it some thin slices of pork or bits of butter ; dredge 
on a little flour ; bake about forty minutes ; when 
done, dish the shad ; then add to the gravy a piece 
of butter, some pepper and salt, and a little hot 
water; give it one boil, and turn over the fish; 
garnish with parsley. 

BROILED SHAD. 

Scrape and scale a shad ; split it down the bacK ; 
wash it clean ; wipe it dry ; lay the flesh side on to 
the gridiron; broil ten or fifteen minutes; then 
turn it skin down; broil ten minutes; dish it, and 
rub over it a little sweet butter ; send hot.

After they are skinned, turn boiling water ovei 
them, and let them remain about half an hour. 
To fry them, cut them up in pieces about six mchea 
long, and fry them the same as codfish. 

BAKED EELS. 

Sprinkle some flour oyer them, and some pieces 
of butter ; put them into a pan with a little water 



pish. 37 

and bake them half an hour. When they are dished, 
make a gravy in the dish that they were baked in, 
with some butter, flour, a little water, mustard, and 
catsup. Give it one boil, and turn it on the eels. 

SALT FISH, OB DUN FISH. 

If you wish to cook a fish whole, put it into the 
fish-kettle with six or eight quarts of water at 
night ; the next morning, wash it clean out of the 
water, wash out the kettle, put in the fish again, 
with as much clean water as at first,, and set it so 
near the fire as to scald, but not to boil. One hour 
before dinner-time, take the fish up into a pan of 
clean cold water, wash off all the skin and fins, 
wash out the kettle again, and lay in the fish care- 
fully; add fresh water, and set the kettle on the 
fire to boil thirty minutes ; dish it in a clean nap- 
kin, on a fish-dish ; to eat with drawn butter and 
pork scraps. 

To make what are called scraps, cut a quarter of a 
pound of fat salt pork into very small square pieces ; 
put them into a frying-pan, stirring them frequently 
until the fat is extracted, and the scraps are done 
light brown. 

If you do not wish to cook a whole fish, cut it 
into pieces about eight inches square ; when dished, 
garnish with eggs boiled hard, and cut into slices, 
with boiled beets. Beets should alwavs be served

meats instead of soup. 

A DISH OP RAW OYSTERS. 

Wash the shells clean with a brush, and wipe dry ; 
lay on a large flat dish, with the deep side down. 
Each person at the table should be supplied with a 
coarse towel and a short knife to open the oysters. 
Some have the top shell taken off in the kitchen ; 
others have the oysters taken out of the shell and 
served in a deep dish. This, I think, is the best way ; 
but they should be left until just before serving. A 
lemon, cut in halves, should always be served with 
raw oysters. 

OYSTER PIE.

season them with pepper, a little mace, a glass of 
white wine; add a cup of very fine cracker-crums,

patties, put on the crust, and send to the table 
immediately, as the crusts should not get soaked 
before using them.

BOAST BEEP. 



A piece of beef weighing ten pounds requires 
two hours to roast. Allow ten minutes to every 
pound over or under this weight. Do not put the 
meat too close to the fire at first. When half done 



44 RECEIPTS. 

turn the fat out of the roaster ; then baste the meat 
with the drippings two or three times. Do not 
salt or flour it until nearly done. Just before 
dishing, dredge on a little salt and flour, baste it 
well, and set it close to the fire to froth. 

The second cut of the surloin, the second cut o* 
the ribs, and the back of the rump, are considereq 
the best parts for roasting. 

TO MAKE A GOOD BEEP GRAVY. 

Take the drippings from the meat after the fat has 
been turned off; turn into a saucepan, and add a 
cup of boiling water ; shake in a little flour and salt, 
and let it just come to a boil, stirring it all the time ; 
add a table-spoonful of soy or tomato catsup. 

BEEFSTEAK. 

A rump steak is the best ; a surloin is the next 
best. To broil a steak requires a quick fire. If 
cooked by a range, it should be put in front, and 
not on the top. Never use a fork to turn the steak, 
nor salt it while cooking. 

A steak half an inch thick requires ten minutes, 
and one an inch thick requires fifteen minutes. 
Have ready a hot dish ; put the steak upon it, and a 
little butter upon both sides ; salt and pepper to suit 
the taste ; adding a little tomato catsup to the gravy 
improves it. 

Waterman's patent gridiron is the best to use with 
a range.

boil. It should be put into cold water. Just before 
it boils take the scum off. A piece of beef weigh- 
ing eight pounds requires five hours' boiling. Be- 
fore sending to the table, the bone should be taken 
out, and the beef pressed half an hour. If done 
so, it looks much nicer, and cuts better. 

EDGE-BONE OF BEEF, 

Weighing ten pounds, should be boiled threo 
hours, as this piece should be a little rare.

well boiled. Cut it in square pieces of about six 
inches ; wash it in salt and water ; wipe it dry ; dip 
it in eggs and crums, or batter, and fry it in hot 
fat. Serve it with oyster sauce. After dishing tho 
tripe, turn a quart of oyster sauce over it. 

ANOTHER TRIPE. 

Be sure the tripe is well boiled, that is, very ten- 
der ; if not, boil it until it is so ; then cut it in 
pieces about four inches square; let it be quite 
cold ; roll the pieces cornerwise ; tie them with a 
thread ; dredge them with a little salt and mace ; 
roll them in egg and crums ; fry in fat a nice 
brown ; serve with a gravy of drawn butter, with a 
little lemon and tomato catsup boiled in. 

. ROAST LEG OP MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton weighing ten pounds should be 
roasted two hours. When half done turn the fat 
out of the roaster; then baste the meat with 
the drippings. Make the gravy the same as for 



MEATS. 53 

roast beefj or add a few spoonfuls of currant 
jelly and a cup of red wine. Ten minutes moro 
should be allowed for every extra pound of mutton, 

BOAST SADDLE OP MUTTON. 

A saddle of mutton, weighing eight pounds, 
requires three quarters of an hour to cook. The 
gravy is made the same as for a leg of mutton. 

A SHOULDER OP MUTTON, 

"Weighing six pounds, requires one hour to roast; 
if stuffed, half an hour longer. Before cooking it, 
tafce out the bone, and fill the space with a dressing 
of bread-crums, pepper, salt, sweet marjoram, one 
ogg, and a small piece of butter. 

TTCO OF MUTTON BOILED. 

A leg of mutton, weighing ten pounds, requires 
an hour and a half to boil. Flour a cloth, tie the 
meat in it very tight, and put it into boiling water ; 
when done, put it into a pan, and turn cold water 
over it, and let it remain two minutes before remov- 
ing the cloth; this makes the mutton look very 
white. 

A SHOULDER OP MUTTON BOILED 

Is cooked in the same way as a leg, except that it 
takes half an hour less time to boil.

54 RECEIPTS. 

HARICOT MUTTON. 

Take a cold leg of boiled mutton, or a small one 
not boiled, and put it into a saucepan that covers 
close ; cut into dice form two carrots, two turnips, 
and two onions ; put them around or under the mut- 
ton; add eight or ten cloves, pepper, salt, and water 
enough to cover the mutton ; simmer it four hours. 
About half an hour before dishing, add a cup of 
white wine, and two teaspoonfuls of soy. The water 
will waste away, leaving enough to make the gravy. 
After taking out the meat, skim off all the fat you 
can before making the gravy; dish the mutton; stir 
a little flour into the gravy, give it one boil, and 
then turn the vegetables and gravy over the meat. 

MUTTON CHOPS, 

If broiled on a gridiron, should be wrapped in 
paper. They require about ten minutes to cook. 
When they are taken out of the papers to be dished, 
season them with pepper, salt, and a little butter. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Lay the mutton chops into a pan; dredge a little 
flour over them ; put them into the oven, with the 
door half open. They require about fifteen minutes 
to cook. Have prepared a hot dish ; after you dish 
the chops, dredge a little flour into your gravy, with 
a few spoonfuls of hot water, tomato catsup, pepper 
and gait ; gi^e it one boil, and turn it over the chops* 



MEATS. 55 

ANOTHER MODE.*' 

Beat up an egg, and season the chops with peppei 
and salt ; dip them in the egg, and then roll them in 
bread-crums ; put them into a pan, and set them in 
the oven; cook them about fifteen minutes. After 
dishing the chops, add to your gravy a little butter 
1 3d wine, and currant jelly ; dredge in a little flour : 
let it boil once, and turn it over the chops. 

MUTTON CHOPS. 

Cut the saddle of mutton, separating each bone, 
trim ofF the thin fat ; rub them over with yolk of 
egg and bread-crums; broil or fry them. Serve with 
gravy as for other chops. 

MINCE MUTTON. 

Chop the mutton very fine ; put it into a frying- 
pan, with some of the gravy, if you have it; if not, 
put in a little soup stock, just enough to moisten it, 
season it with butter, pepper, and salt ; stir it fre* 
quently, that it may not fry, but get very hot. Serve, 
nn slices of toasted bread ; garnish with lemon. 

MUTTON PIE. 

Take cold roast mutton, cut in nice slices; lay 
them in a pie-dish; season them with pepper and salt; 
add the cold gravy and a spoonful of currant jelly ;

paste, or rice, or potato crust. Bake it three qua*, 
ters of an hour. 

ANOTHER, 

Made of cold boiled mutton. Cut all the meat in 
nice slices ; lay them in a pie-dish, with the remains 
of the drawn butter and capers, a little pepper, salt, 
and a cup of white soup stock; cover the pie with 
potato or rice crust. Bake half an hour. 

A FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 

The bone should be taken out; fill the cavity 
with a dressing made of bread-crums, pepper, salt, 
and sweet marjoram, a piece of butter the size of 
an egg, or a little fat pork chopped very fine, and 
one egg ; mix this up well ; skewer the veal tight, 
to keep the dressing in. It adds to the look and 
taste of a fillet of veal to lard it with xpork ; if this 
is not done, it should be basted often with butter. 
A piece weighing eight pounds requires four hours 
to roast. 

A LOIN OF VEAL 

Is very nice, roasted plain. It is, however, very 
palatable cooked the same as a fillet of veal, by 
taking out the kidneys, and putting dressing in their 
place. It requires three hours if roasted plain, and 
three and a half hours with dressing. 



HEATS. 51 

A BREAST OF VEAL BOASTED 

Requires an hour and a half to roast. A few strips

cloth, pin up the head very tight, and put it into six 
or eight quarts of water to boil, with two pounds of 
salt pork. Tie up the brains in a piece of cloth sep- 
arately. Let the head boil about two hours ; then 
add the liver, lights, and brains, and let all boil two 
hours more. Remove the cloth, and the large bones 
will come out very easily from the head ; lay it on a

the head, and send the remainder to table in a gravy- 
dish. Garnish your dish with scraped horseradish 
and lemon sliced. 

TO STEW A CALF'S HEAD. 

Boil the head, so that the large bones can be 
taken out with ease, but not enough for eating ; put 
some butter into a stewpan or baking-kettle ; when 
the butter is melted, put the jelly part of the head 
down with it, so as to brown it handsomely. Move 
it a little while cooking, lest it should stick to the 
bottom. Then turn over the head, dredge flour 
around the kettle enough to thicken the gravy, and 
let it brown a little ; take about a quart of the liquor 
in which the head was boiled, and pour it on the 
head in the kettle; put in half a tumbler of wine,

then take out the large bones, split the feet, and lay 
them into a saucepan ; shake in a little flour, two 
ounces of butter, a little pepper, salt, mace, half a 
teacup of white wine, a table-spoonful of vinegar, 
and two teacups of the liquor in which the feet 
were boiled. Simmer this all together about ten 
minutes, and send it to the table very hot, garnished 
with sliced lemon.

wine, and give it one boil ; cut a lemon and two 
hard-boiled eggs in pieces, place them in the bottom 
of the tureen, and pour the soup on to them. 

ROAST LAMB. 

The fore quarter is much the best piece to roast. 
It should be roasted about one hour and a half, and 
frequently basted. To make the gravy, take all the 
dripping from the tin roaster, add a very little water, 
a little salt and flour, and give it one boil. 

MINT SAUCE,

BOAST VENISON. 

A leg of venison weighing fourteen pounds should 
be roasted one hour if eaten on blazers ; if on hot 
plates, two hours. The dry skin should be taken off 
before roasting, with the fingers, not with a knife. 
The spit should be turned very often. When half 
done, it should be basted with flour, butter, and red 
wine, very frequently, until done. To make the 
gravy, take the shank of the venison, crack the bone, 
a pound of juicy beef, an onion stuck full of cloves, 
a little pepper and salt. Put it into a saucepan with 
two quarts of water, and boil it gently three hours. 
Strain this, and add to it the drippings from the 
venison, with nearly a quarter of a pound of butter, 
braid in two table-spoonfuls of flour, a teacup of red 
wine, and a teacup of currant jelly. Stir it all up, 
and let it boil about five minutes. 

A SADDLE OP VENISON. 

A saddle of venison is much the best piece of the 
deer. It requires but half the time to roast this 
that it does the leg, for it is a much thinner piece. 
Dressed in the same manner as the leg. 

A VENISON STEAK. 

Gut steaks from the leg half an inch thick, broil 
them about five minutes ; season with pepper, salt, 
and butter. If you have it, a cup of the roast veni- 
son gravy, very hot, is very nice poured over it;, or 
half a cup of red wine, and half a cup of currant

jelly, thickened with a little flour and butter, boiled 
up and turned over the steak. It should be served 
very hot. 

VENISON PIE. 

Take the breast and neck of venison, and cut them 
into small pieces. Season with pepper, salt, and a 
little ground cloves, and dredge it well with flour ; 
put it into the pie-dish as close as possible, fill up 
t^ie dish with some of the roast venison gravy, or 
gravy prepared in the same manner, and cover the 
dish with a nice crust. Bake it half an hour. 

ROAST PIG. 

Make a dressing of bread-crums, a little salt, pep- 
per, sage, sweet marjoram, an onion chopped fine, 
butter, two eggs, and a little salt pork, and fry this 
a little ; when cold, stuff the pig, sew it up, and then 
wash it in salt and water ; baste it often. A pig 
weighing nine pounds requires four hours to roast. 

A SPARERIB OR CHINE OP PORK 

Is much nicer if rubbed over, before it is roasted,* 
with a little pepper, salt, and fine sage. Take all 
the fat out of the roaster when about half done, and 
then with the dripping make the gravy. 

PRIED PORK STEAKS. 

Pry a few slices of salt pork, take them out of 
the frj ing-pan, dredge a little flour over the steaks

twenty minutes slowly. Slices of apple fried in the 
fat are very nice tc eai with the pork. 

PHIED PIGS' FEET. 

Make a batter with a little flour, water, a little 
salt, and one egg. Dip the feet in to cover them 
Have your fat hot, and fry them until quite brcwn. 
Make a little drawn butter, and add a spoonful of 
vinegar to serve with them. 

pig's head cheese. 

Boil a pig's head until the bone comes out, and 
chop this very fine; pound about eight soft crackers 
very fine, and mix this up well ; add some sweet 
herbs, . pepper, salt, and spices. Put this into a 
mould, and press it for two or three days. It is 
very nice cut into thin slices, and eaten cold. 

BOAST HAM, 

Spit a ham ; set it before a moderate fire to roast 
about two hours, turning the spit frequently ; then 
take it up on to a dish, peel off the rind, scrape all 
the fat out of the roaster, put it to the fire to roast 
again about two hours more ; basting it frequently 
in the same way as for beef. To make the gravy ; 
put the dripping from the roaster into a saucepan, 
add a cup of water, a little flour, and give it one 
boil. Served in a sauce-tureen. 

A roasted ham is far superior to a boiled one* 



72 XIECEIPTS. 

BOILED HAM. 

A ham should be put into cold water enough to 
more than cover it, and boiled gently. A ham 
weighing fifteen pounds requires five hours' boiling. 
When about half done, and a part of the water has 
boiled away, add, if approved, a bottle of cham- 
pagne, or a pint of good white wine vinegar ; cover 
the pot close, to keep the flavor of the wine. 

An old ham should be laid in cold water over 
night. 

BOILED LEG OP CORNED PORE. 

One weighing ten pounds should be put into cold 
water ; boiled three hours after it begins to boil. 

BROILED CORNED PORK.

out. Make a dressing of two cups of bread-crums, 
one teaspoonful of salt, two large spoonfuls of 
sweet marjoram, two spoonfuls of butter, one egg, 
and mix them well together. Cut the skin of the 
turkey in the back part of the neck, that the breast 
may look plump ; fill the breast with the forcemeat, 
and sew it up. If you have any more forcemeat 
than is required for the breast, put the remainder 
into the body, and skewer the vent ; ' tie the legs 
down very tight, skewer the wings down to the 
sides, and turn the neck on to the back with a 
strong skewer. Baste with salt and water once, 
then frequently with butter ; fifteen minutes before 
dishing, dredge with a little salt and flour, and baste 
with butter for the last time. This will give a fine 
frothy appearance, and add to the flavor of the tur- 
key. 

To make the gravy, put the gizzard, neck, and 
liver, into a saucepan with a quart of water, a little 
pepper, salt, and mace ; put it on the fire, and let it 
boil to about a half pint. When done, braid up the 
liver very fine with a knife, and put it back into the 
water it has boiled in ; then add the drippings of 
the turkey and a little flour, and give it one boil, 
stirring it all the time. Dish the gizzard with the 
turkey. Allow twelve minutes to a pound for the 
time to roast a turkey. 

A turkey weighing ten pounds requires two hours

to roast with a clear fire, not too hot. Turn the 
spit very often. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Is prepared the same as for roasting, except in 
the dressing. Put in the pork chopped very fine, 
instead of butter. In trussing, turn the wings on 
the back, instead of the sides, as for roasting ; flour 
a cloth well; pin up the turkey tight; put it into 
boiling water where one or two pounds of salt pork 
have been boiling some time ; let this boil with the 
turkey. Dish the pork with the turkey on a sepa- 
rate dish, with some parsley. Serve with oyster or 
celery sauce. 

A turkey weighing eight pounds requires an hour 
and a half to boil. 

BOAST CHICKENS. 

Dress and roast the same as a turkey. A pair of 
chickens weighing six pounds require an hour and 
a half to roast. Make the gravy the same as for a 
turkey, except the mace, which is to be omitted. 

BOILED CHICKENS. 

Dressed and boiled the same as a turkey. Some 
cooks do not stuff boiled chickens or turkeys ; but 
the dressing adds as much to the boiled as to the 
roast. Pork boiled with chickens is very necessary. 
A pair of chickens require from one to two hours 
to boil, depending upon the size and age.

CHICKEN OB TURKEY STEWED WITH CELERY. 

Take a yearling hen-turkey, prepare as for boiling, 
place it in a large saucepan or small soup-pot. Cut 
up a large head of celery in inch pieces, and one 
onion very fine ; put this, with white pepper, salt, 
and a large teaspoonful of mace, all round the 
turkey, just cover it with hot water, and let it come 
to a boil; set it a little off the fire, and let it simmer 
two or three hours, depending on the size. Dish 
the turkey; cover it to' keep hot while you are 
preparing the gravy. Braid together half a pound 
of butter and two table-spoonfuls of flour, put it 
into the saucepan with the gravy ; add a cup of 
cream, give it one boil ; turn the whole over the 
turkey. Garnish with sprigs of curled parsley. 

Chickens may be dressed in the same way. 

TO BONE AND COOK A BONED TURKEY. 

Clean the turkey well, lay it on the table, have a 
small, sharp-pointed knife ; begin at the wing, pass 
the knife close to the bone, cut the flesh from the 
bone, and keep the skin as whole as possible ; then 
pass the knife on each side of the breast, and then 
around the legs ; split the back about half way up, 
and draw out the bones. Have ready a stuffing 
made of the meat of a chicken chopped very fine, 
bread-crums, pepper salt, mace, sweet marjoram, a 
piece of butter, and two eggs, all well mixed up. 
Fill the turkey, and sew it up, preserving the form. 
Have two calf'd feet cracked up well and the

bones that have been taken out of the turkey put 
into a deep saucepan, with one onion and one carrot 
cut very fine, mace, pepper, salt, and a few cloves. 
Lay the turkey on the bones, and add two quarts of 
water ; cover it tight, and let it simmer three hours ; 
then take out the turkey, flour it, baste it well 
with butter, and set it in the oven to brown. If 
there is not one quart of gravy, add more water, 
and let it boil half an hour. Beat up the whites 
and shells of two eggs, and stir into the gravy, and 
let it boil fifteen minutes ; strain it through a cloth 
into a jelly-mould. When the turkey is cold, and 
the jelly hard, dish the turkey with the jelly on 
the breast, or cut it small, and serve round the 
turkey. 

This is considered a very nice supper dish. 

HASH TURKEY OR CHICKENS. 

Gut the meat from the bone ; take off the skin ; 
cut the meat into small pieces; put them into a 
saucepan with a little pepper, salt, and, if you have 
it, a little cold gravy ; if not, put in a little butter 
and a cup of hot water. Dredge in a little flour ; 
cover it very tight, and simmer it ten or fifteen 
minutes. Stir it frequently, to prevent from frying. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Gut the chicken into four quarters ; season them 
with pepper, salt, a little mace, and sweet marjo- 
ram; lay the chicken into the dish very close; 



POULTRY. 77

and a cupful of hot water (or veal stock), enough 
to fill the dish. Make a good paste crust ; line the 
sides of the dish and rim; put in the chicken; 
cover it over with the crust ; cut a hole in the top, 
and bake it half an hour. If the chickens are not 
very young, they should be boiled half an hour, after 
they are cut up, with some strips of pork. 

EAST INDIAN CURRY. 

Skin a chicken ; cut it in small pieces ; take two 
table-spoonfuls of flour, and one of curry-powder ; 
stir them together dry ; dip the chicken into it, and 
fry it a fine light brown. It may be fried in pork 
or butter. Put it into a pot, and pour over it boiling 
water enough to cover it ; let it boil slowly until 
tender. Mix the remainder of the flour and curry 
with a little water, and put into the pot, and boil it 
a few minutes more ; salt to the taste. 

To be eaten with rice boiled tender, but dry ; it 
must look like a snowball. 

WHOLE CHICKENS CURRIED. 

Put the chickens whole into a saucepan, with a 
little pepper, salt, and a few pieces of pork ; covet 
them with cold water. When about half done, add 
a cup of rice, and a little more water if required. 
Let it boil until the chicken is quite tender ; then

absorbs the butter ; then turn it on the dish, but do 
not stir it up. Serve it very hot, 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Take a common goose ; clean it well, and wash 
it the same as turkey. Make a dressing of six or 
eight potatoes well boiled and mashed, two onions 
chopped very fine, two teaspoonfuls of sage, one 
of salt, and one of pepper; put it into the body 
of the goose, and sew it up; roast it two hours; 
baste it in its own drippings. When about half

drippings are sufficient for the gravy ; boil the 
liver, <fec., as for turkey. The gravy is made the 
same as for a turkey. 

A MOUNTAIN GOOSE. 

Cleanse it the same as the turkey. Make a dress- 
ing of bread-crums, one onion chopped very fine, 
two spoonfuls of sage, pepper, salt, a little pork

requires two hours. The gravy is made the same 
as for common goose. 



POULTRY. 81 

A MONGREL GOOSE 

Is dressed the same as the common goose ; but, 
as the mongrel has so much flavor, the dressing is 
unnecessary. Without dressing, an hour and a half 
will roast a large-sized goose. 

• 

WILD GOOSE. 

A wild goose should be roasted rare ; one hour's 
roasting is sufficient. Add a glass of red wine and 
half a cup of currant jelly to the gravy, which is 
made the same as for the common goose. Boil it 
together, and send it to the table in a sauce-tureen, 

ROAST DUCKS 

Are dressed in the same way as geese. A large 
pair of tame ducks require one hour to roast, black 
ducks half an hour, and canvas-back twenty-five 
minutes. The gravy made the same as for goose. 

Wild ducks should be roasted after the soup is 
sent to the table. 

ROAST PARTRIDGES. 

Lard them well with fat pork ; tie the legs down 
to the rump, leaving the feet on; while cooking, 
baste them well with butter. They require twenty- 
five or thirty minutes to cook. To make the gravy, 
put the drippings into a saucepan with a piece of 
butter about the size of an egg, and a little flour 
and hot water. Let it boil up once.

tridges are put into the pot. 

TO BROIL PARTRIDGES. 

Split them through the back; broil them fifteen 
minutes; dish them with pepper, salt, and a little 
butter. A piece of salt pork broiled to eat with 
them is a very great improvement. 

GROUSE. 

Grouse should be roasted rare, say about twenty

two eggs. Mix this up well with the hands ; stuflF 
the bodies; sew them up, and truss them very 
tightly. Roast them half an hour ; baste them with 
butter, and a strip of salt pork pinned on to the 
breast with a small needle. For the gravy, take the 
drippings, a cup of meat stock, a piece of butter 
with a little flour ; put in half a glass of red wine, 
and half a teaspoonful of cloves. Give it one boil. 

POTTED PIGEONS. 

Prepare them by the directions given for roast- 
ing ; lay five or six slices of salt pork in the bottom 
of the pot ; chop an onion very fine, and fry it in 
the fat to a nice brown ; then put the pigeons into 
the pot quite close, with a little pepper and salt, 
and shake in a little flour ; turn in hot water,' or 
brown stock enough to quite cover over the pig- 
eons, and stew them gently one hour ; if the water 
boils away, add a little more. Split six crackers; 
dip them in cold water; cover the pigeons over

ing with the meat, mix it up with a spoon ; add a 
little more vinegar, put it into the centre of a flat 
dish ; cut the lettuce in quarters ; dry the lettuce 
in a napkin, and lay it neatly around the meat ; turn 
the remainder of the dressing over the lettuce. It 
may be served the same as the above, or cut the 
celery very fine with a knife, but do not chop it. 
After it is cut, mix it well with the meat. Send it 
to table in a celery bowl. 

LOBSTER SALAD 

Is made the same way as chicken salad, only the 
lobster should be cut into small pieces, and not 
chopped. The row or coral of the lobster should 
be grated fine to garnish the dish. 

SALAD DRESSING* 

Take the yolks of two hard-boiled and two raw 
eggs, put them into a flat dish, with a large spoon- 
ful of fresh mixed mustard, a little salt and Cayenne 
pepper ; stir this well together with a large wooden 
spoon, or an egg-beater ; turn in by degrees half a 
bottle of sweet oil, half a cup of good, sharp vinegai, 
and the juice of a lemon, stirring all the time. I 
sometimes add cream instead of vinegar. 



GARNISHING FOR DISHES. 89

the dish about three or four inches high, rub it 
over with the yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven 
to brown. When it is done, turn the hash into the 
middle of the dish. This makes a very handsome 
finish to a dish. 

Rice prepared in this way, spread over a pie 
made of cold meat, for the crust, an inch thick, and 
browned, is nice. 

POTATO CRUST OR EDGING. 

Boil one dozen good potatoes, and mash them 
well. Add a piece of butter, a little salt, and half a

and pour boiling water over them ; let them stand 
while you fry a few slices of salt pork ; wipe them 
dry, and fry as many at a time as will cover the 
bottom of the pan.

water to cook. Every kind of vegetable, excepting 
green peas, should lie in cold water some time 
before cooking them. 

ANOTHER FRIED POTATOES.

which they are to be boiled. 

TO DRESS PEAS ANOTHER WAY. 

Put them into a saucepan ; place it into another 
vessel of boiling water ; put in a small piece of

rntil they are quite tender; wash them out again, 
and put them into an earthen pot; scald and gash 
one and a half pounds of pork ; place it on top of 
the beans and into them, so as to have the rind of 
the pork even with the beans; fill the pot with 
water in which are mixed two table-spoonfuls of 
molasses. Bake them five or six hours ; if baked 
in a brick oven, it is well to have them stand in 
over night. 

STEWED BEAKS, 

Put a quart of cranberry or white dry beans to 
soak in cold water over night ; wash them out 
of this water, put them into cold water, and set 
them where they will get scalding hot ; wash them 
again, rubbing them through your hands, to take 
off what hulls you can. Put them in three quarts 
of water, where they can simmer three hours. Put 
a piece of rather fat salt pork to boil about one 
hour ; take it up, skin it, and put it in with the beans ; 
let them simmer two hours. Serve the pork with 
the beans.

Dry toast should never be laid one slice upon 
another, but set on the edge to keep it dry. 

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

The coffee should be dried in the oven with the 
door open one or two hours before roasting. When 
it is ready to roast, set it on the fire in an iron pan, 
and stir it constantly until it becomes a light brown. 
To two pounds of coffee add a bit of butter about 
the size of a walnut three minutes before taking it 
from the fire. Coffee is much better when it is 
roasted, ground, and made within one hour. One 
cup of ground coffee will make one quart of coffee. 
To make coffee in a biggm put the ground coffee 
into the filter, wet it with cold water, and let it stand 
five minutes to swell. Put the filter into the pot 
where it belongs ; fill it up with boiling water, and 
set where it will keep hot, but not boil. When this 
has run through, add.water until you have made a 
quart of coffee. It does not require more than ten 
minutes to make good coffee. 

To boil coffee, put into a coffee-pot one cup of 
ground coffee, and stir in one egg, or a piece of salt 
fish-skin two inches square ; add one quart of water. 
Boil it ten minutes, take it off, turn a cupful out at 
the spout, and back again into the pot. Let it stand 
ten minutes. Turn it off into another pot to send 
to table. Boiled cream or milk should always ba 
uorved with coffee.

let it stand about five minutes ; then fill up the tea- 
pot with boiling water. The quantity depends on 
taste. 

TO MAKE SHELLS OR COCOA. 

They require two or three hours to boil. Some 
persons like cocoa roasted and pounded before boi? 
ing it. 

CHOCOLATE. 

To a quarter of a pound of chocolate add two 
quarts of water, stirring it frequently until it is dis- 
solved ; give it one boil, then add one pint of cream 
or one quart of milk, and give it one more boil. 
Sweeten it to your taste.

RICH PUFF PASTE. 



To one pound of flour allow one pound of butter. 
Wash the butter in cold water ; divide it into three 
parts, make it into thin cakes, and lay them on the 
ice to harden. Sift the flour ; take one cake of tho 
butter and rub it well into the flour; mix it up 
lightly with tho tands with cold ice-water ; sprinkle 



116 BECEIPTS. 

a little flour on the paste-board, and roll the crust 
out very thin, rolling from you always. Be careful 
not to break the crust with the rolling-pin. Roll 
out one cake of butter as thin as possible, lay it on 
the paste, dredge on a little flour, roll up the paste, 
then roll it out thin again ; roll out the other cake 
of butter, lay it on the paste, dredge on a little more 
flour, and roll it up again. Cut it into as many 
pieces as required. For edging, roll out a piece as 
long as will go around the plate without piecing, as 
it looks much better. The edging should be three 
or four layers of paste rolled very thin, and put on 
the rim of the plate. Use sifted flour to driedge on 
the paste-board, and to roll the butter and paste 
together. This flour is included in the weight of 
the flour for the paste. 

COMMON PASTE. 

Take one pound of flour, and three quarters of a 
pound of butter ; sift the flour on the paste-board ; 
take two thirds of the butter, cut it with a knife 
into the flour, mix it up with just ice-water enough 
to stick the flour and butter together, and roll it 
out about an inch thick ; put the rest of the butter 
on the paste ; dredge on some flour, roll up the 
paste, flour the board and roll out the paste again 
smooth, and then roll it up again. 

This is a very good paste to line the plates with, 
and use the puff paste for the edging and uppei 
crust.

A VERT GOOD COMMON PASTE. 

To a pound of flour take half a pound of butter 
and a quarter of a pound of lard (this is best in 
winter), or half butter and half lard, allowing a 
pound of flour to three quarters of a pound of 
shortening. Mix the lard and a little salt with the 
flour very lightly and quickly with ice-water ; flour 
the board, roll out the paste about a quarter of an 
inch thick ; put half the butter on with a knife, in 
little bits, dredge on a plenty of flour, roll up the 
paste, then roll it out again ; put the other half of 
the butter on the same as before, and again roll it 
Tip. This is a very nice crust for meat pie. 

VOL-AU-VENT. 

Take rich puff paste, roll it half an inch thick ; cut 
she shape and size to suit the dish it is to be served 
in. Roll the piece of paste left not quite half an 
inch thick ; cut two strips one inch wide ; brush the 
paste on the dish with a little cold water ; lay on a 
rim, brush that over with water; lay on another 
rim ; fill out the paste with pieces of stale bread ; 
roll a cover, place it on top, marking it round the 
size of the inner rim ; brush this over with the 
white of an egg ; set it into a quick oven to bake. 
Be careful that it bakes even ; it may require turn- 
ing, as it must rise even to look well. It will bake 
in about half an hour. When done take off the 
cover with a knife, take out the bread, fill it with 
whatever you please, place the cove r on, and send

it to table. This is a very handsome dish for coin 
pany. 

If the top is brushed over with egg and sugar, 
and sprinkled with pounded almonds, and the vol-au 
vent filled with preserved fruit, it is a very hand- 
some dish for dessert. 

CHEESE CAKE. 

Roll out some nice puff paste, not very thin, brusl 
it over with cold water, spread it half over with 
grated cheese; then lap the other half over, and 
pass the rolling-pin lightly over it; cut into strips 
about four inches long and two wide ; bake in a 
quick oven. These are very nice with dessert. 

APPLE PIE. 

In the fall of the year, when apples are very juicy, 
they make nice pies without stewing. Cut them 
thin; line a deep plate with crust; put in a layer of 
apple, some good brown sugar, a little mace or cin 
namon, grated lemon-peel, and a very small piece of

the eggs, stirring them all the time. Boil it in a 
pitcher, as before directed. 

APPLE FLOAT. 

Stew six large apples; lay them on a sieve to 
drain and cool ; then put them on a flat dish, with 
about two spoonfuls of fine white sugar, a very lit- 
tle essence of lemon, or the juice of one, and the 
whites of two or three eggs. Beat all this to a 
froth with an egg-beater; fill a glass bowl, or custard- 
cups, with soft custard. Lay this froth ou as high 
as it will stand.

SWEET DISHES, OR VARIETIES. 161 

good white wine, and let it stand and absorb the 
wine. Grate on a little nutmeg, a rind of lemon, 
fill the dish two thirds full with soft custard, and 
then lay over the top a whip as high as possible. 

ANOTHER TRIFLE. 

Put sponge cake into a dish, turn over it a tum- 
bler of champagne or white wine ; lay over it some 
kind of preserved fruit about an inch thick, and 
then put over this a colored whip, with^a few bits 
of currant jelly to ornament it.

stand very high. 

WHIPS. 

Take a pint of rich cream, sweeten it not very 
sweet, flavor it with essence to the taste. Put it 
in a shallow dish, set it on the ice a while, and it 
will whip much sooner; place the whip-syringe 
quite to the bottom of the dish, and move it very 
quickly as the froth rises. Lay it on a sieve to 
drain. 

WHIPS IN GLASSES. 

Put a spoonful of jelly or jam in the bottom of 
jelly-glasses, and fill the glasses with the whip made

COLORED WHIPS. 



Add to the cream a few spoonfuls of jelly, or 
mice of any kind of fruit, of the color you prefer. 



A VERY FINE WHIP. 

A pound of sugar, half a pint of wine, the juice 
of four lemons; mix all together; add a quart of 
rich cream, whip it to a strong froth, and serve in 
glasses. 

PINEAPPLE WHIPS. 

Cut up the pineapple, sprinkle a little sugar ovei 
it, and let it stand over night ; strain it through a 
sieve ; add as much sugar as will prevent the cream 
from turning when added to the juice. Add the 
cream, and whip it well. It is a very great addition 
to place a layer of pineapple jam in the bottom 
of the dish. 

AN ORNAMENT FOR SWEET DISHES. 

Beat up to a strong froth the whites of eggs, sift 
on a very little fine sugar, and set it in the oven to 
brown a very little. This laid on the top of cus- 
tards of any kind is a great improvement to ilia 
appearance. 



TCE CREAM. 163 



ICE CREAM. 

MADE OF CREAM. 

To a gallon of cream allow two pounds of loaf 
sugar; flavor it to the taste. The flavoring must 
be quite strong, as the freezing destroys it in part. 

MADE OP MILK. 

To a gallon of milk allow ten eggs. Boil half 
the milk ; beat up the eggs ; turn the boiling milk 
into them, stirring them all the time ; strain it, 
and then add the cold milk, the sugar, and the 
flavoring. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Mix a little milk and four dessert spoonfuls of 
arrowroot; boil two quarts of milk, and stir the 
arrowroot into it; then add two quarts of cold 
milk, the sugar, and flavoring, such as currant, rasp- 
berry, strawberry, plum, peach, pineapple, lemon, 
&o. A quart of the cream, whipped to a strong 
froth, and stirred into the cream when half frozen, 
is an improvement. 

LEMON FLAVOR FOR ICES. 

Rub some lumps of sugar over the outside of 
three good lemons until you extract the essence; 
squeeze the juice, strain it, and add as much sugar 
as the juice will absorb. This will flavor one gallon 
of cream. 



164 RECEIPTS. 

PINEAPPLE FLAVOR. 

Take a ccmmon-sized pineapple; cut it in slices ; 
sprinkle some sugar over it ; cover it up, and let it 
stand over night ; strain it, and add more sugar, if 
necessary, for one gallon of cream. 

PEACH-WATER FLAVOR. 

Take three table-spoonfuls of the water to one 
gallon of cream. 

RASPBERRY FLAVOR. 

Add sugar to the raspberries; mash them, and 
strain the juice. A quart of raspberries will flavor 
a gallon of cream. 

STRAWBERRY FLAVOR. 

Made the same way as the raspberry. 

VANILLA FLAVOR. 

Simmer one bean in half a pint of milk until the 
flavor is extracted, — say two or three hours. 

WATER ICES. 

Take a gallon of ice-water ; sweeten it very sweeti 
and flavor it with any flavor that is agreeable to the 
taste. Freeze it the same as ice cream. 

ROMAN PUNCH. 

Make the punch with wine and brandy, sugar 
and lemon flavor, as for ice cream. It should be 



ICE CREAM. 165 

very strongly flavored, as in freezing it diminishes 
one half. 

DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING ICE CREAMS, WATER 

ICES, ETC. 

Break the ice in small pieces, — say about the 
size of an egg, or smaller, — and put some in the 
bottom of a tub ; set the kettle in ; then put in 
about a quart of coarse rock salt ; then two quarts 
of ice ; and so on until the tub is filled up to the 
top of the kettle. Stir it until the cream is frozen. 
In the old-fashioned freezer you must take off the 
cover frequently, and scrape off the cream from tta 
sides until it freezes evenly.' 

If it is to be put into moulds, fill them quite full, 
shut them very tight, and put them in the ice and 
salt, covering'them entirely ; then throw over a 
piece of carpet to keep the air out. To take them 
out of the mould, have your dish ready, wipe the 
mould, and then turn over it some boiling water, 
wiping it again very quickly ; then turn it on the 
dish. Remove the mould very slowly, for fear of 
breaking. When pure essences can be procured, 
they are quite equal to fresh fruits to flavor with. 

N. B. — Good and pure essences and sirups may 
be obtained at Messrs. Smith & Melvin's, at 325 
Washington-street, Boston, who manufacture the 
above-named articles expressly for retailing, and 
may be relied on.

take a pint of juice to a pound of white sugar, boil 
it ten minutes, and strain it into moulds or jars. 

The apple can be seasoned, and used for apple 
sauce. 

APPLE MARMALADE 

Is made the same as the crab apple, except that 
the apples must be peeled. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

Take a pound of fruit to a pound of sugar ; put 
them together into the kettle, and boil it gently one 
hour, stirring it frequently. Put it up in jars, and 
let it stand about four days ; if in that time the 
sirup rises at the top, put it in the kettle, and boil 
it half an hour. 

RASPBERRY OR BLACKBERRY JELLY. 

Stew the fruit, strain it through a sieve, measure 
a pint of juice to a pound of sugar, boil it twenty 
or thirty minutes, and then strain it through a very 
fine sieve into the jar while it is hot. Let them 
stand two or three days ; then do them up in the 
same manner as currant jelly. 



PRESERVES. 185 

PRESERVED BARBERRIES AND SIRUP. 

One pound of sugar, one pound of barberries, one 
half pint of water ; put the sugar and water to boil , 
when boiled enough to skim, put in the barberries ; 
let them boil until the sirup is thick ; skim out the 
barberries into jars, with sirup enough to keep 
them. Strain the rest of the sirup through a cloth ; 
put it into bottles, cork and seal them. This makes 
a very nice drink with ice-water. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

The currants should be ripe, and fresh-picked. 
Put them into a preserving-kettle with a very little 
water, say about a cupful, to prevent them from 
burning. Let them stew gently until the currants 
turn white, then strain them through a sieve ; they 
will not require much squeezing. Take a pint of 
Juice to a pound of sugar, put them into the kettle, 
and boil it thirty minutes. Take a spoonful out on 
a plate, and set the plate on ice; if it is done, it will 
stiffen in five minutes. Then strain it through a 
very fine sieve into small glass jars. Set them in 
the sun two days. Put a piece of paper wet with 
brandy on the top, and over this a bladder, and tie 
them up. 

ANOTHER WAT. 

Pill a stone jar with fresh-picked ripe currants ; 
set it in a kettle of cold water ; let the water 
boil untfi the currants look white, then strain 



184 RECEIPTS. 

the juice from them through a towel. To a pint of 
juice put a pound of crushed sugar; stir it while 
dissolving ; when it gets to a boil, let it boil fifteen 
minutes; strain into small jars to cool; when cooled, 
secure it from the air. 

PRESERVED CITRON MELON. 

Peel the melon, take out the inside, and cut it in 
Buch pieces as you like-thin strips, about a quarter 
of an inch thick, I think are the best. Then weigh 
the melon, and take the same weight in fine white 
sugar ; put a little alum in some water, and boil the 
melon in it until it is tender ; take it up on a dish, 
sprinkle the sugar over it, and between the pieces, 
and let it stand over night. Then turn off the 
sirup into the preserving-kettle, and boil until 
clarified ; then put the melon in, and boil it until 
scalded through; take it out on a dish to cool. 
Add to the sirup two lemons and a little preserved 
ginger, to flavor it ; boil the sirup again, until quite 
clear; put the melon up into jars, turn the sirup over 
it, not quite boiling hot ; when cold, seal up your 
jars as for other preserves. 

PINEAPPLE. 

Peel the pineapple, and cut it in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; take a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit; sprinkle the sugar over the apple, 
and let it stand until the next day. Then put it 
into the kettle, and boil it until the apple looks clear* 



PRESERVES. 186 

Take out the apple to cool ; give the sirup one boil ; 
and then strain it through a hair sieve on the fruit. 

PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Peel the apple and weigh it — a pound to a pound 
of sugar ; grate the apple on a coarse grater ; put 
the apple and sugar in the kettle together, and let 
it boil thirty or forty minutes. 

STRAWBERBIES. 

Weign one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; 
put the sugar into the kettle with just water enough 
to prevent its burning ; boil to a sirup ; then put in 
as many strawberries at a time as will cover the top 
of the sirup without crowding them, and let them 
boil twenty minutes. Take them out carefully, so 
as not to break them, and put them in a dish to cool 
separately. When cold, put them into glass jars, 
and strain the hot sirup through a hair sieve on to 
them. 

The Hovey Seedlings are the best to preserve in 
this manner, as they are very large. If, however, 
they get broken, it would be better to put them 
back into the kettle, and boil them thirty minutes 
for jam. 

ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh a pound of fine loaf sugar to a pound of 
fruit ; sprinkle the sugar over the fruit, and let it 
stand over night. The next day, strain off the sirup 

16*

and boil it about ten minutes ; then put in the fruit, 
and let it boil gently twenty minutes more. Skim 
out the fruit on a flat dish to cool. When cool, put 
them in jars ; add the sirup, and tie them up tight, 
with paper dipped in brandy, and a bladder over it. 

CODDLED APPLES. 

Peel the apples, leaving the stems on, and put as 
many as will stand into the preserving-kettle or 
saucepan; put in a little water, and let them boil 
until they are tender; take them out carefully; 
allow a cup of sugar to three apples ; put it into the 
water that they were boiled in, and boil it ten min- 
utes. Peel a lemon very thin, in very narrow strips; 
lay them around the stem of the apple ; put them 
into the sirup, and boil them until they are clear. 
Put them into the dish in which you send them to 
the table, and pour the sirup on them. These will 
not keep more than three or four days. 

PEARS. 

Peel the pears, boil them in water- until they 
are quite tender, and then take them out on a dish 
to cool. Make a sirup of white sugar. A few 
pieces of ginger and a slice of lemon make a nice 
flavor to the sirup. Put in the pears, and boil them 
gently until they are quite clear ; the time depends 
on the size ; if they are small they require about 
thirty minutes. If to keep all winter, allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. 



FOR THE SICK. 187 

STEWED PEARS. 

Take large honeyed pears, and peel, core, and 
quarter them. Take two quarts of the pears, a pint, 
bowl of sugar, a pint of water, and put all this into 
a preserving-kettle or saucepan. Cover it tight, 
snr! stew gently one hour. 



FOR THE SICK. 

A DINNER FOR A DYSPEPTIC. 

A fresh cod's head well cleaned; put it intc a 
saucepan with a pint of water, a little salt, and let it 
simmer gently two hours ; dredge in a very little 
flour, a small piece of butter, a little more water if 
necessary, and let it simmer another hour. This is 
very nutricious, and very easy of digestion. 

BEEF TEA. 

Take a slice of beef weighing half a pound, cut it 
in pieces half an inch thick, half broil it, put it on a 
plate, sprinkle it with a little salt, cut it in pieces an 
inch square, put it into a pitcher, and turn in it a 
pint of boiling water. Cover it up tight; let it 
stand fifteen minutes, and strain it into a bowl. 

ANOTHER BEEF TEA. 

Cut in small pieces a pound or more of beefj 



188 RECEIPTS. 

depending upon how much tea you wish to make > 
pat the beef into a pitcher, or any earthen vessel, 
covered tight. To a pound of beef add a little salt 
and a pint of cold water ; let it steep two hours. 
You will have half a pint of tea; set it to cool a 
long while, to get off all the fat. 

BEEF JUICE FOB THE SICE. 

Cut one pound of beef into small pieces, put it 
into a bottle and cork it up ; set the bottle into a 
kettle of cold water ; let it stand over the fire until 
the water boils, and longer if the juice is not all out 
of tho beef. This is for invalids who can take but 
little liquid at a time, therefore cannot take beef tea. 

ANOTHER BEEF JUICE. 

Take about a pound of rump of beef; lay it on the 
gridiron ; let it just warm through ; sprinkle a little 
salt over it ; cut it in pieces about the size of half a 
lemon ; then with a lemon squeezer all the juice can 
bo extracted. 

This is the best and quickest method of getting 
clear beef juice. 

CHICKEN TEA. 

Cut up a fowl in small pieces ; put it into an 
earthen vessel, with some, salt and three pints of 
water ; let it boil three hours ; strain it ; set it to 
cool six or eight hours ; then take off the fat. The 
tea will be like a jelly.

INTRODUCTION. 



It is about nine years since I published my last 
book of Receipts for Cooking. Since that time, I 
have been constantly engaged in providing for a 
large, and sometimes for a small, family ; therefore 
I have had opportunity to improve, as practice 
makes perfect in every profession. 

I do not presume to say that I have perfected my 
knowledge ; but nine years have given me so much 
more experience, that I am induced to make addi- 
tions to my book of many receipts that I think will 
be very useful ; and as provisions of all kinds are so . 
expensive, all housekeepers are glad to receive any 
suggestions of economy. 

If a lady is convinced that she can, by her own 
attention to her housekeeping, make her expenses 
much less and home more comfortable, I think she 
would take as much pride in her well-ordered house- 
hold, and well-cooked dishes, as her great-grand- 
mother did of old. It is not necessary that a lady 
should give up any of her real accomplishments, as 
an educated, refined lady, to attend to her house- 
keeping, for the first requisite is economy of time as 
well as money ; every hour of her day may be spent 

17 * (1»7) 



198 INTRODUCTION. 

-with profit to herself and to others, thereby receiv- 
ing much, and giving much, pleasure. 

When a young lady allows herself to be placed at 
the head of her husband's establishment, she is ex- 
pected to preside with dignity and propriety. Is it 
not necessary that she should be capable of directing 
understandingly her household ? To be able to di- 
rect well is necessary, if she expects her orders well 
executed. 

Young people have the idea that they do not wish 
to be troubled with their cooking, therefore they do 
not care to know much about the matter. This is a 
mistaken notion. It is not necessary that a lady, to 
have her cooking well done, must with her own 
hands do it. 

I provide, and have a large dinner to attend to, 
every day, but I do not cook it. If I was obliged to 
do so, I should think myself a poor director of my 
business. But it is absolutely necessary that I 
should know how everything in my house is to be 
done, from the cleaning of a knife to the best cooked 
dinner I have served. 

If I should be so situated that I felt it necessary, I 
could go into my kitchen and cook a dinner ; and I 
think that we should have better cooks, and be bet- 
ter served, if every lady knew enough of housekeep- 
ing duty to be thus far independent. 

We all know that much of the happiness of a 
family depends on good food, well cooked, and well 
served. Here is another necessity for economy of 



INTRODUCTION. 199 

time — punctuality. If your time is set for your 
meals, you expect your cook to be punctual, and to 
serve her meals hot. That you cannot have, unless 
you are ready yourself to receive them — for if they 
must be kept hot by standing in the oven or on hot 
plates, the dinner will be spoiled — you waste your 
own time, and your servants too. 

Negligence is very easily learned if you are not 
punctual. Your servants soon learn to think, 
" Well, mistress will not be ready; therefore it is no 
great matter if I am a little late." A half hour late 
here and there soon absorbs our time, which is 
valuable, and whose is not ? 

It is under these impressions that I have set my- 
self to the work of helping the young housekeeper to 
please herself and husband, by her ready use of the 
advice that I have, or can give her. 



ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 201 



ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 

These receipts I give for a small family, for it is 
almost impossible to cook little enough for two with- 
out waste, and I think most people like made dishes 
if well made, and that cannot be without the atten- 
tion of mistress and cook, for made dishes require 
more judgment and attention than a fresh cooked 
joint of meat, although I think all cooking requires 
care. 

A very common fault is, that there is not at- 
tention enough paid to this branch of housekeeping. 
In almost all families the cook is required to take 
a part, and often a large part, of the washing and 
ironing ; therefore she will either not do this well, 
or neglect the cooking. A cook who likes her busi- 
ness, and consequently does it well, does not like 
washing and ironing; therefore, if a cook must 
wash, it is best to have a simple dinner on that day, 
and a cold dessert, giving as little cooking as possi- 
ble, if you want both done well. 

BOUILLI BEEF. 

A piece of the round, or shoulder of mutton piece, 
or a part of the face of the rump, makes a very nice 
bouilli. 

Take eight or ten pounds of beef ; put it to boil 
six or eight hours in six quarts of water, with two 



202 ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 

onions, two carrots, one dozen cloves, salt, and pep- 
per. Take up the beef ; set it away until the next 
day ; strain the liquor into the soup-jar ; the next 
day set on the fire a saucepan that will about hold 
the beef ; cut two onions fine, fry them in a little 
butter, dredge in some flour to brown, lay in the 
beef; have ready two carrots, two turnips, two 
onions, a little celery, one leek, all cut in small dice 
form; lay them round the beef; then add enough 
of the stock it was boiled in to just cover it. Let it 
cook slowly two hours and a half. Dish the meat ; 
add to the gravy one table-spoonful of mixed mustard, 
one of soy, and a little flour if it has not consistency 
enough ; give it one boil ; turn over the meat the 
vegetables and gravy ; chop fine two pickled cucum- 
bers, and sprinkle them over the top of the meat. 
The water the beef was boiled in may be served as a 
clear beef soup. 
What is left of the bouilli makes a nice 

BEEF PIE. 

Cut the beef in slices ; cut in very thin slices one 
onion ; lay this in the bottom of the pie-dish ; then a 
layer of beef; dredge in a little flour ; then a layer 
*>f beef, and onion, pepper, salt, and flour, and beef, 
until the dish is full : then add the cold gravy ; if 
not enough, a little stock or water ; scald and peel 
as many tomatoes as will cover the dish ; lay them 
on, pepper, salt, and bread crumbs, a few bits of but- 
ter ; set it into the oven to brown. By the time the

very nice dish. 

mutton pie. * 

If you have a leg of mutton boiled for dinner, set 
' the water away until the next morning; and also 
the dish that the mutton was served in, just as it 
eomes from the table. 

Cut all the mutton from the bone that you will 
use for broth ; cut the mutton in not very thin 
pieces ; cut up an onion ; chop a little parsley. Lay 
into a pie-dish a layer of meat seasoned with a little 
onion (if you like, the onion may be omitted), a little 
parsley,* pepper, and salt, and a little of the cold 
drawn butter and dish gravy that was left ; another 
layer of meat and seasoning as before., and so on 
until the dish is nearly full. Have tomatoes enough 
peeled to eover the dish ; sprinkle over some pepper 
and salt; cover all with bread crumbs, and a few 
little bits of butter. Set it into the oven. By the 
time the tomatoes are warm, the mutton is hot. 
This dish saves your cold mutton, and is very nice. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

Set away the water that the mutton was boiled in, 
in a stone jar, or some kind of earthen dish ; the 
next day take off all the fat ; put the broth into the 
soup pot, with the bones of the mutton cracked up, 
two onions, two carrots, two turnips, cut small ; let 
it boil one or two hours ; with a skimmer take out 



204 ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 

the bones ; add half of a large cup of rice ; seme 
salt. Let it boil one hour, and you will have a very 
good mutton broth. 

BEEF PIE. 

Cold roast beef (from the bone to be used for 
soup), cut in not very thin pieces; slice an onion, 
fry it in a little beef drippings ; add a little flour to 
brown ; lay this into a pie-dish ; then the beef; 
season with pepper and salt ; a few slices of toma- 
to, if you like ; all the beef juice that was left in 
the dish ; as much of the gravy as will nearly fill the 
dish ; add a little water, or beef stock if you have it. 
Boil eight or ten potatoes ; mash them fine ; add a 
little salt, half a cup of cream or butter ; stir this up 
light ; spread it over the pie-dish an inch and a half 
thick ; brush it over with a paste brush dipped in a 
beaten egg. Set it into the oven for half an hour 
to brown. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

The water chicken was boiled in, set away in a 
cool place, makes a good broth. The next day skim 
off the fat ; take the bones of the chicken ; put into 
the soup-pot with the broth, one onion cut very fine, 
one carrot, one turnip, a small bunch of parsley, a 
little salt, and pepper ; let boil two hours ; with a 
skimmer take out the bones; add a half cup of 
vermicelli ; let boil one hour ; you will have a nice 
chicken broth. 

Take off all the meat you can from the bones. To

tle meat. ; 

^ CHICKEN PATES. 

Gold chicken chopped fine makes a nice chicken 
salad ; but if you have not enough for that, season 
the chicken with a very little mace, pepper, salt, 
half a cup of cream ; put it into a saucepan ; let it 
get hot. Have ready a nice paste ; line a few patty- 
pans with it, and bake them ; then fill them with the 
hot chicken. Slip them out of the pans on to a 
small dish. Half a dozen patds make a pretty dish. 
All these little things saved help a dinner. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Made of cold roast, or boiled chicken. Skin the 
chicken ; cut it in nice pieces ; lay these in a pie- 
dish ; if you have any of the cold gravy put that in, 
if not, put the chicken bones into a saucepan with 
as much water as you want of gravy ; season with 
pepper, salt, and a very little mace ; boil this until 
all the strength is out of the bones ; put it into the 
dish; cover it with a good paste. Bake it about 
half an hour. 

PEICASSEE OP COLD CHICKEN. 

Skin the breast of the chicken ; cut the rest in 
nice pieces ; lay the breast into the saucepan, with 
the other pieces round it ; dredge in a little flour, 
pepper, salt, mace ; a piece of butter the size of au

egg, braided with a spoonful of floor, half pint of 
cream or good milk, and half a gill of white stock 
or water ; let it simmer about twenty minutes. 
Dish the breast in the middle, place the. other pieces 
round it, and turn on the gravy. 

teal. 

I have it from one of our first physicians, that this 
is not unwholesome when well cooked. This meat 
can be made into many little side dishes. A leg of 
veal makes a part of four dinners. The shin a soup, 
the next cut a fillet, two slices cut from the round a 
cutlet. The meat that you can take off the shin 
that is boiled for soup, will make as nice a salad as 
chicken, for it is boiled very tender. Chop it very 
fine, and dress it the same as chicken, and many 
would scarcely know the difference. What is left 
of the fillet makes nice croquettes. Or chop it very 
fine, put it into a frying-pan with the cold gravy, and 
let it get very hot, but not fry ; serve it on toast, or 
with toast cut in three-cornered pieces, and set up 
round the dish. If you have no gravy, add a piece 
of butter, pepper, salt, and a very little hot water ; 
stir it well ; be sure not to let it fry, for that would 
r>poil it. 

COLD LOIN OF VEAL. 

Cold loin of veal makes the best mince, because it 
has more fat, and is, consequently, less dry than the 
leg. A little of the mince veal makes nice pate's as 
chicken in paste. 



ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 207 

ANOTHER VEAL CROQUETTE. 

Chop the veal very fine ; add half as much bread- 
crumbs as veal ; season with mace, pepper, and salt ; 
add one raw egg; roll thin in pieces about three 
inches long ; dip them in egg and crumbs ; fry in 
hot fat. Served in a small flat dish, dressed with 
parsley. 

STEWED BREAST OF VEAL. 

Lay a nice breast of veal in a baking-pan ; turn 
over it one quart of water ; set it into the oven to 
stew about two hours ; then baste it with butter, and 
brown it. Make the gravy with what remains of the 
water it was stewed in ; dredge in a little flour, pep- 
per, salt, a small piece of butter ; give it one boil ; 
send to the table in a gravy-dish. 

VEAL POT-PIE. 



-• ^ 



Take a scrag and knuckle of veal ; fry a few slices 
of pork in the soup-pot ; cut the veal and knuckle in 
small pieces, and put it into the pot ; add pepper 
and salt ; just cover the meat with cold water ; let 
it boil two or three hours; add six or eight small 
potatoes ; if not seasoned enough, add more pepper 
or salt. Have a nice raised dough; rollit about 
half an inch thick ; cut it in pieces, and cover the 
meat. Cover the pot tight, and let it stew half an 
hour. When dishing, lay the crust round the dish ; 
put the meat and potatoes in the middle. This is a 
very homely dish, but good and cheap.

\ 



STUFFED LOAF. 



Mince what is left of a leg of veal ; mix with it 
pepper, salt, a little mace, and a little onion if pre* 
ferred. Take a stale baker's loaf (an outside onp is 
preferable, as it has more crust) ; cut a hole about 
three inches square in the bottom of it, and scoop 
out all the soft (this can be saved for a bread-pud- 
ding) ; then, after heating the mince in the spider, 
fill the loaf with it ; replace the square piece of crust 
and tie it up ; then put the loaf into the spider in 
hot fat, and turn it over until the whole is a dark 
brown. Garnish the dish, and it will be a very at- 
tractive looking ornament for a table. 

\ 

VEAL LOAF. 

Three pounds uncooked veal; half pound salt 
pork chopped fine ; three eggs ; three teaspoonfuls 
of salt, two of pepper ; a handful of cut parsley, 
sweet herbs ; one cup of cracker-crumbs. Bake one 
hour and a half. Basting with butter. Cut in 
slices when cold. 

A SHIN OF BEEF. 

To make a very nice dish to cut cold for lunch, 
tea, or breakfast, with baked potatoes. Put a snin 
of beef to boil in eight quarts of water, with a table- 
spoonful of salt ; just before it comes to a boil skim 
it well ; let it boil all day ; if the water boils away, 
add more, but not too much —just enough to keep

it from burning. When the meat is boiled to 
shreds, turn it out into a pan, that you may take 
out every little bit of bone ; put it back into the pot ; 
season it well with pepper, salt, cloves, allspice, and 
a little sweet herbs if you like ; let it simmer half 
an hour ; stir it up well ; turn it into a deep dish ; 
set it away. When it is cold it will be as hard as 
cheese. Cut it in thin slices ; garnish the dish with 
parsley. This will keep on the ice in summer a 
week, and in winter a month. It is very nourishing, 
as it has all the substance of a shin of beef that 
would be used for two or three days for soup. 

COLLALU. 

Half a peck of tomatoes ; quarter of a peck of 
ochra ; peel them, and put them on to stew with a 
slice of ham; stew them an hour; then add two 
pounds of hashed meat, and two onions ; season it 
highly with pepper and salt, and let it remain on 
the fire three or four hours. 

AN ENGLISH BOUND OF BEEF. 

Take the top part of a fine fat round of beef, 
weighing about fifteen pounds ; corn it for three or 
four days ; take it out of the pickle ; do not wash 
off all of the salt ; tie it round strong, to keep it in. 
a perfect round Shape when cooked ; put it to boil 
with not much more water than will cover it ; boil 
with it four carrots and six turnips ; let them boil 
moderately four hours. Serve with it the carrots

cut lengthwise. Mash the turnips with a little salt 
and butter, a cabbage or cauliflower, and beets. For 
gravy, take three gills of good drawn butter, add one 
large table-spoonful of mixed mustard, one of soy, 
one of vinegar, or the juice of a lemon, or plain 
drawn butter, as you may choose. This is nice cold, 
sliced thin.

ON BREAD-MAKING AND BAKING. 

As bread is one of the most essential articles of 
food, it is of great importance to have good bread, 
well baked, as a matter of health and economy as 
well as pleasure. We cannot expect all this with* 
out care and attention. One must have good yeast, 
good flour, and willing, clean, strong hands. 

YEAST. 

This is the first requisite for good bread. Tou 
can buy yeast at the baker's or brewer's, but home- 
made is better than either. 

Take as many dry hops as you can grasp in your 
hand ; put them into a saucepan ; turn on two 
quarts of boiling water ; set them on to boil. In 
another saucepan put eight or ten potatoes to boil ; ' 
when the potatoes are done, the hops will be boiled 
enough. Mash the potatoes fine ; add two table- 
spoonfuls of salt; strain the hop-water on to the 



J 



BftEAD-MAKING AN0 BAKING. 211 

potatoes ; stir in as much flour as will make a thin 
batter ; let it stand to cool ; when cool enough to 
put your hand in, stir in one pint of good yeast, 
either baker's or brewer's ; set it to rise five or six 
hours, or until it is all of a foam ; then strain it 
through a cullender into a stone jug ; stop it tight ; 
keep it in a cool place. This will keep a week. It 
is best to make yeast while you have enough to rise 
a new jug fulL 

MAKING DRY YEAST. 

' In the country people are frequently troubled to 
get yeast to start with. This is a reliable receipt : 

Take one pound of good dry hops ; put them in a 
pailful of water ; let it boil one hour. Boil one peck 
Of good potatoes ; mash them fine ; strain the water 
from the hops on to them ; add one teacup of salt ; 
stir in flour enough to make a thin batter ; let it. 
stand to get cool. When cool enough to put your 
hand in, stir in one quart of good fresh yeast ; set it 
to rise six or eight hours ; when it is all of a froth, 
have ready very nice-sifted corn meal ; stir this m 
until it is thick enough to roll out; roll this about 
ft quarter of an inch thick ; cut it into squares about 
four inches. Lay a sheet down where the sun is very 
bright; spread the cakes on it to dry; turn them 
twice a day until perfectly dry r then pack them away* 
It takes two or three days to make, a batch of dry 
yeast. When wanted for use, take a cake, put to it 
half a pint of lukewarm water, a table-spoonful of 



212 BREAD-MAKING AND BAKING. 

sugar, a teaspoonful of salt ; stir in flour enough to 
make a thin batter ; set it in a warm place until it 
rises. This will rise four quarts of flour. Mix the 
same as the other yeast bread. 

FOB MAKING LOAF BREAD. 

Sift the flour into a large dry pan ; always sift 
flour before using it, it is much lighter. It is best 
to have it ready before beginning any other prepara- 
tions. Put into a tin pan, or wooden one, two 
quarts of warm water, not hot; stir in about a quart 
of flour ; stir this up with your hands ; add one cup 
of yeast, one table-spoonful of salt ; keep stirring or 
beating up the mixture ; add more flour, working it 
with both hands, until you get enough to make a 
smooth light dough. Cover it with a clean cloth ; 
set it to rise in a warm place over night. In the 
morning flour the bread-board, turn the dough on to 
it, and knead it well with both hands ; cut it into 
two or three loaves, and knead each one. Bub the 
bread-pans with a little butter; put in the bread, 
and let it stand to rise thirty or forty minutes, or 
till you see it has risen ; put it into the oven to bake 
three quarters of an hour. When you take it out 
of the oven turn the loaf over, and strike it with 
your knuckles ; if it makes a ringing sound, the 
bread is baked, if not, let it bake ten or fifteen 
minutes longer. If the crust seems to have baked 
too hard, take a clean towel, wring it out of cold 
water, roll the bread in it, and let it' remain about 



BREAD-MAKING AND BAKING. 21 3 

fifteen minutes. It will cut better when the bread 
is cold. 

A little Indian meal in white loaf bread is very 
nice for a variety. Sift and scald, with boiling 
water, a quart of meal ; let it stand until cool ; mix 
this in with the flour. The bread requires a little 
more salt, and a little more baking, than when made 
all flour. 

I use butter to rub on my bread-pans, as any other 

v fat might leave an unpleasant taste on the crust. A 

small piece of butter warmed in a saucer, and put 

on to the pans with a clean piece of cloth, is the best 

for buttering pans for baking bread and cake. 

BREAKFAST AND DINNER BOLLS. 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg ; put it 
into a pitcher, and turn on a pint of boiling water ; 
stir it until the butter is melted ; then add one pint 
of cold milk. Turn this into the bread-pan ; add 
three pints of flour ; stir it up ; then half a cup of 
good yeast, half a cup of white sugar, one spoonful 
of salt ; stir this briskly ; keep adding flour, and 
beating it, till it is of good consistency, neither too 
hard nor too soft, but smooth and light to the hands. 
Cover it with a cloth (in winter put a piece of 
woollen cloth over the bread-cloth to keep it warm, 
that it may rise well). In the morning turn the 
dough on to the bread-board ; knead it well with 
both hands, and roll it out about an inch thick ; cut 
it in equal bits as large as you wish the rolls. Take 



214 BREAD-MAKING AND BAKING. 

the bits between your hands, and roll them in long 
rolls of about six inches and two wide; have the 
bread-pans rubbed with a little butter ; lay the rolls 
in, in even length and shape ; let them rise an hour, 
and bake twenty minutes. When you take the 
rolls from the oven — before you take them from 
the pan, and while they are hot — brush them over 
with a little butter. This adds very much to the 
appearance, making the rolls look smooth and glossy. 
These long rolls are nice for breakfast. For dinner 
make them shorter, about four inches in length, but 
the same width, or roll out the dough, and cut it 
with a common-sized biscuit-cutter ; baked the same 
as the rolls. 

DYSPEPSIA BREAD, WITHOUT YEAST, 

Take a quart of Graham flour ; a teaspoonful of 
skit ; turn on boiling water ; stir it quickly ; let it 
stand until cool enough to make into cakes. Make 
them up when the meal is as hot as you can handle 
it ; put them into little iron pans ; bake them one 
hour. Must be eaten hot.

^ SOUP-MAKING. 



-TEE ON SOUP-MAKING. 

Always rub salt into the meat for soup stock ; 
put it into cold water to boil ; just before it comes 
to a boil skim it well, for if allowed to boil before 
that thick scum is taken off, it will boil into the 
soup, and cannot be taken out at all. Spice, pepper, 
and salt may be put into the pot after it is well 
skimmed ; but never put in vegetables when boiling 
stock, for that would cause it to turn sour. After 
soup stock has boiled enough to extract all the juice 
of the meat, and becomes a jelly, it spoils it to boil 
more. So that if you have a good soup stock of 
meat, all that you have to do is to boil your vegeta- 
bles, that you wish to season with, in just water 
enough to cover them ; let them boil enough to ex- 
tract all the flavor. If you put the soup to boil, and 
the vegetables in it, by the time the flavor is ex- 
tracted nearly half the soup will be boiled away. 

Put a piece of butter in the bottom of the soup- 
pot, with one or more onions sliced, according to the 
quantity of soup to be made, allowing one good-sized 
onion to every quart of soup ; fry the onion a nice 
brown ; dredge in a little flour to brown ; strain the 
water from the vegetables through a cullender into I 

the pot ; add as much of meat stock as you wish to 
have soup; stir this up, and boil it about fifteen 
minutes. If you wish to flavor with wine, put it 



SOUP-MAKINO. 219 

into the tureen, and pour the hot soup on to it, for 
if you put it to boil with the soup the flavor is lost. 
It is the same with catsup or soy, or any seasoning 
of that kind. 

Bread-crumbs, too, should be put into the tureen, 
as they will become too soft if boiled. 

TO MAKE A SOUP STOCK. 

What I call brown stock, is made of beef shins and 
a piece of coarse beef. White stock is made of veal 
shins, and an old fowl if you choose. 

One hind shin of veal will make three quarts of 
good veal stock ; one hind shin of beef will make 
five quarts of good beef stock ; one beef shin and one 
veal shin together will make eight quarts. The 
veal and beef together make the best soup. You 
can buy half of each, if you do not want as much as 
the whole will make. Wash the shins clean, but do 
not soak them ; rub over them a little salt ; put 
them into an iron pot, and put in twice as much 
water as you expect to have soup. It must be set 
on the fire to come to a boil ; do not forget to skim 
it before it comes to a boil ; then set it back on the 
range, where it will boil gently all day. Keep it 
covered, so that it shall not boil away too fast ; if it 
does boil away too much, add more water, so as to 
keep about the quantify desired. If you require the 
soup to be more meaty or richer, add to the shins a 
good piece of coarse juicy meat, either beef or veal ; 
what in called a shoulder-of-mutton piece of beef is 



220 SOUP-MAKING. 

very juicy, and about six pounds with the shins will 
make the soup much richer, but the shin is the most 
nutritious in soups. 

All kinds of bones of roast or boiled meat or 
poultry, if boiled long enough, make good soup 
stock. They should be boiled all day to extract tho 
substance of the bones as well as the meat, then 
strained into a stone jar or earthen pot, never in tin, 
to stand in a cool place until the fat cools, then take 
that off. If this process is observed, you can alwaya 
have a good soup, because you have a good stock to 
begin with ; you can flavor it as you please* 

I have given many receipts for soup, but these re* 
marks are for standard directions, 

ON SOUP-MAKING. 

It is necessary to have a flat-bottomed pot to set 
on, not into, the range, for fear of scorching, as a 
soup is spoiled if it has the slightest taste of being 
burned. It is best to boil the bones in such a pot, 
as they must boil all the time slowly, and a flat- 
bottomed pot can be set back on the range. 

TO DEES3 A GREEN TURTLE FOR SOUP. 

« 

Cut off the head, and hang it with the body to 
bleed. When the bleeding has stopped, place tho 
turtle on its back ; with a strong sharp knife separate 
the back from the under shell ; take off the fins ; cut 
up the under shell, and put it into a pan with tho 
fins ; turn boiling water over them ; let them stand 



SOUP-MAKING. 221 

ten minutes. Take them out; then with your 
fingers and a small knife peel off all the tough, skin ; 
throw them into salt and water ; take the inwards, 
separate the liver, lights, heart, and sweet-breads 
from the gall ; wash the entrails and inwards very 
clean ; put them into another pan of salt and water 
to soak ; clean the meat and green fat from the top 
shell ; put them all into water, and let them soak 
over night. 

* 

TO MAKE THE SOUP. 

Wash all the turtle ; put it into clear fresn water 
to soak for an hour ; leave the liver, lights and 
sweet-breads, heart and green fat, soaking ; the rest 
of the turtle and a calf s head put into about five 
gallons of water, to boil gently all day (do not use 
the haslet with the calf s head) ; tie the liver, lights, 
sweet-bread, and heart, in a cloth : put them into a 
pot to boil three hours; take them out to cool to 
make force-meat balls ; strain the soup through a 
coarse cullender ; set it away with the meat in a cool 
place till the next morning. Put about half a pound 
of butter into a largo soup-pot, with four large onions 
cut fine ; fry to a nice brown ; take the pot off the 
fire ; add one table-spoonful of ground cloves, one of 
allspice, one of mace, two of grated nutmeg, one of 
pepper, two of salt, two of sweet marjoram, two of 
summer savory, two of chopped parsley ; stir this 
together, then add the soup ; set it to boil ; take 
out with your fingers all the little bones from the 

19* 



222 SOUP-MAKING. 

meat ; put all into the soup, adding the green fat ; 
let *11 boil about four hours. While the soup is 
boiling, chop up very fine the liver, lights, and 
sweet-bread and heart; add one teacup of bread- 
crumbs, the yolks of four eggs, one teaspoonful 
of ground cloves, one of mace, one of thyme, 
one of sweet marjoram, one of summer savory, 
one of pepper, and two of salt ; drop in two 
raw eggs and half a pound of butter ; mix this all 
up with the hands; make it into balls the size of 
robins' eggs ; roll each in egg and bread-crumbs ; 
fry brown in hot lard ; put up to dry, and keep hot ; 
cut up in small pieces six lemons, six hard-boiled 
eggs ; dividing this into four parts, put one into 
each tureen, with a quarter of the balls in each ; 
then add to the soup one quart of red and one 
of Maderia wine ; give it one boil ; dip it upon the 
lemon, egg, and force-meat balls ; send it to the 
table very hot. This will make four gallons of soup. 
These are directions for a turtle weighing fifty 
pounds in the shell. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

The calf s head should be soaked in cola water one 
hour, and washed very clean. If a large head, allow 
six quarts of cold water ; boil it two hours, then add 
the liver and lights ; tie up the brains in a small 
cloth ; let them boil an hour and a half. Take up 
the head ; strain the liquor into a stone jar ; set it 
away to cool until the next day. When the soup is 



i 



SOUP-MAKINQ. 223 

to be made, take off all the fat ; put about one quart 
of the stock, one quart of cold water to boil, with 
two large onions, two carrots, two turnips, a stalk of 
celery, one dozen cloves, one dozen pepper-corns, 
one table-spoonful of salt ; boil it slowly two hours. 
Have a flat-bottomed soup-pot ; set it on the fire to 
get hot ; put a little butter in it, with two onions cut 
fine, to brown — a nice light brown ; stir them all 
the time to prevent burning; dredge in a little flour. 
Have the calf s head cut in small pieces ; then strain 
the vegetables from the stock; put all this into the 
soup-pot, and let it boil one hour. If you like the 
soup very dark, add one table-spoonful of allspice. 

TO MAKE THE BALLS. 

Take half a pound of raw veal, and some of the 
liver, lights, and brains ; chop them very fine, and 
season well with pepper, salt, ground cloves, sweet 
herbs ; drop in two raw eggs ; mix this well ; roll it 
into balls the size of a common nut ; roll them in 
egg and crumbs, and fry them in hot lard. 

Boil two eggs hard ; lay them in cold water until 
they are quite cold ; take the yolks, and mash them 
fine ; add half a table-spoonful of flour and a little 
salt ; mix this together ; then take a little into your 
left hand, and rub it with your right into a small 
bull ; make it all up into balls. Cut a lemon in 
small pieces. If the soup does not seem quite rich 
enough, take quarter of a pound of good butter ; 
braid into it a large spoonful of flour ; stir this into 



224 SOUP-MAKING. 

the soup ; let it boil about five minutes ; add a 
tumblerful of white wine. Put the force-meat balls, 
egg balls, and lemon into the tureen ; turn the hot 
soup on to them. I think this soup as good as a 
turtle soup. 

A CLEAB SOUP. 

Cut up a large shin of beef and one of veal ; put 
them to boil in ten quarts of water ; let it boil all 
day ; do not forget to skim it very well ; put in one 
dozen white pepper-corns, a few bits of mace, three 
bay leaves ; keep the pot covered tight that it may 
i:ot require much more water, that is, that you may 
have about five quarts of soup. Strain it into a 
stone jar, and set it to cool. The next day take off 
all the fat ; you will have a strong jelly ; two hours 
before the soup is wanted, cut up four carrots, four 
turnips, and four onions ; just cover them with hot 
water, and set them on the fire to steep two hours ; 
strain this into the soup-pot ; put in the jelly ; let it 
boil half an hour ; beat up three eggs and shells ; 
stir them in, and let it boil ten minutes ; set it back 
on the range where it will keep hot, but not boil ; 
add one cup of cold water ; if it requires any more 
seasoning, add a little essence of celery or cloves, or 
whatever you prefer, in the tureen. Strain the soup 
through a flannel bag as you would jelly ; if it cools 
it must be put into the soup-pot and heated over, as 
it must be served very hot. Put a pint of white 
wine in the tureen if you like. 



SOUP-MAKING. 225 

POTATO SOUP. 

Boil four large mealy potatoes ; mash tbem fine ; 
add one egg, a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, a little essence of celery. 
Boil one pint of water, and one pint of milk or 
cream ; turn it on to the potatoes, &c, boiling hot ; 
stir it well ; strain it, and send to the table immedi- 
ately. 

ANOTHER POTATO SOUP. 

A nice soup with very little expense. If you have 
merely the carcass of any kind of poultry from a 
previous dinner, put it on to boil in about two quarts 
of water, with one large onion cut in small pieces, 
one carrot, one turnip, a little mace, or bay leaf; let 
this boil three hours. Take six large boiled pota 
toes ; mash them fine ; add one egg, a little salt and 
pepper ; strain the soup on to this. There will be 
about three pints of soup ; add one pint of milk ; 
give it one boil, and send it to the table. 

JULIENNE SOUP. 

Put a piece of butter the size of an egg into the 
soup-pot; stir it until it melts; cut three young 
onions fine ; fry them a nice brown ; then put in two 
quarts good veal or white stock, a little mace, pep- 
per, salt, three young carrots, three turnips, a stalk 
of celery, a pint of green peas. Boil it all one hour. 
This is a nice summer soup. * \^ v

226 SOUP-MAKING. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

The same as above, with a young cabbage cut 
fine ; add beef stock, and season with cloves instead 
of mace. 

VERMICELLI SOUP 

Boil a shin of veal, two onions, two carrots, two 
turnips cut up, a little salt, in four quarts of water, 
three hours ; strain it ; add two cups of vermicelli ; 
1* t it boil half an hour. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil a shin of veal in four quarts of water four 
hours; add pepper, salt, two onions, two carrots, 
two turnips, two dozen tomatoes ; boil one hour ; 
then strain out all the vegetables. Mix one cup of 
ground rice or arrowroot ; stir it into the soup ; add 
one cup of sugar ; give it one boil. Send it to table 
yery hot. Serve with it toasted bread cut in small 
pieces, and put in a dish to be passed to those who 
like it. 

ANOTHER TOMATO SOUP. 

If you have but little to make soup of, and want 
it without preparing the day before, put the bones 
into the pot with one onion, one carrot, and one 
dozen tomatoes ; cut the vegetables up ; pepper ; 
half a dozen cloves ; let this boil two or three hours ; 
strain out the bones and tomato seeds ; skim off the 
fat ; turn the soup back into the pot, with a cup of 
cold water, about two table-spoonfuls of arrowroot, 



SOUP-MAKING. 227 

ground rico or flour ; stir this into the soup ; add 
half a cup of sugar ; let it boil ten minutes. Take 
some toasted bread, cut it into small square pieces, 
put them into the tureen, and dip the soup on to 
them. This, you perceive, costs but little, and helps 
your dinner a great deal. 

OYSTER SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

To two quarts of oysters put one quart of cold 
water ; wash out the oysters clean ; strain the water 
through a fine sieve or cloth. Put a piece of butter 
the size of an egg into a large saucepan ; dredge in 
some flour, a little pepper, and a very little mace ; 
turn in the liquor, and let it come to a boil ; put in 
two large spoonfuls of cracker-crumbs, mixed in a 
little water ; stir this well ; add a piece more butter, 
and then the oysters ; let it boil up once. Have 
ready in the tureen some soft crackers split and 
toasted ; turn the soup in, and add a cup of white 
wine, or a spoonful of good vinegar or lemon juice. 

ANOTHER OYSTER SOUP. 

A very good oyster soup may be made without 
meat. Strain off all the water from the oysters ; add 
as much hot water as you have oyster water ; add a 
little mace, pepper, and salt ; let it boil five minutes ; 
then put in the oysters ; let it boil up once. Have 
ready some toasted crackers buttered ; turn the 
soup on to them. 



228 SOUP-MAKING. 

ANOTHER. 

Add to the boiling liquor a few cracker crumbs 
and a piece of butter ; stir into the soup ; then put 
in the oysters ; give it one boil. If you like, add a 
glass of white wine or cream. 

A LOBSTER SOUP 

May be made without meat. Cut the meat of 
lobsters fine. Break up the bones and shell ; boil 
them one hour in about two quarts of water ; strain 
out the bones, and put in the lobster ; boil it half an 
hour. Braid a little flour into a piece of butter the 
size of an egg ; stir this in, and let it boil once ; 
season it with pepper and salt, and a little vinegar 
or wine. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP. 

Beat two or three eggs, add a little salt, and stir 
in flour enough till the mixture is as stiff a paste as 
can be rolled ; flour the rolling-pin and board so as 
to roll it smoothly. Roll it in three strips ; let them 
lay an hour to dry ; roll each piece in a long roll, 
and cut it in slices as thin as possible ; shake them 
apart, and let them lay and dry, as it makes them 
lighter, and prevents their sticking together. After 
the soup is skimmed drop the noodles in, and let 
them boil twenty minutes. These are nice in any 
dark soup.

mulligatawny soup. 

Place in a stew-pan four ounces of butter, four 
large onions cut in slices, one carrot, two heads of 
celery cut small, and fry slowly till the onions are 
nearly melted and of a nice light brown ; then add 
as much flour as will thicken the quantity of soup to 
be made. Stir this over the fire for a few minutes, 
after having first mixed with it two or three table- 
spoonfuls of the best curry powder, and then as much 
consomm£ of veal or white stock as will make a 
sufficient quantity of soup. Now put it on the fire 
and stir till it boils ; then place it by the side of the 
fire to clarify in the usual way. Next rub it through 
a cullender into a pur£e ; pour it into a soup-pot, 
and place it again on the fire ; let it boil ten 
minutes; add the meat of a boiled fowl cut into 
small slices, free from bone, and the juice of two 
lemons ; skim thoroughly ; ascertain that the sea- 
soning is correct, and send to the table with some 
rice in a separate dish. 



FISH. 



CLUB CHOWDER. 



Have prepared the following : A good stock from 
veal or beef ; water will answer, but the chowder is 
better with stock. Boil twelve potatoes, and mash 

20 



230 pish. 

them. Slice and fry brown six large onions. Soak 
two ship or other hard biscuit soft. Fry four slices 
of pork cut in small dice. Cut in slices about an 
inch thick eight pounds of fish : cod, sea-bass, had- 
dock, or black fish are the best. Have chopped fine 
three table-spoonfuls of parsley. 

Have a pot capable of holding three gallons, in 
which first put five or six table-spoonfuls of butter ; 
scatter over one half of the fried onions ; add a table- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of black pepper, a tea- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg and ground clove mixed. 
Put in a layer of fish, and then a layer of mashed 
potato, and one half the biscuit ; add a bouquet of 
thyme or summer savory ; repeat the same opera- 
tion, leaving out the spice and thyme. Then pour 
in your stock or water, sufficient to cover the fish 
about four inches ; add the parsley, also the juice 
of a lemon, squeezed into a tumbler of water in which 
you have dissolved four or five lumps of sugar. 
Place it on the fire, and let it cook gently an hour 
and a half. Color the chowder a dark brown. It 
should be of the consistency of calf s head soup. If 
too thin, thicken it with a little flour and water. 
The fried pork you can add before it is served, if you 
fancy it. I never use it. Just before serving, add 
a small tumbler of Maderia or sherry. 

Preserved mushrooms, clams, or oysters add to 
the flavor. If the quantity of spice does not suit the 
taste, add as much more as you please. 



FISH. 231 

QUAHAUG CHOWDER. 

The quahaugs should be put into a pot with water 
enough to half cover them ; boil them twenty min- 
utes. Then take out the quahaugs, and make it 
the same as clam chowder. 

CLAM CHOWDER. 

Be very sure that the clams are fresh. One peck 
of clams put into £n iron pot to boil with one quart 
of water. Cover very close to keep the steam in ; 
when the clams open, turn them out into a large tin 
pan ; take out all the meat from the shells ; set 
them to cool. Strain the water back into the pot to 
boil ; just before it boils skim it well. Have peeled 
and sliced about six large potatoes; put into the 
water to boil ; fry. four slices of nice salt pork ; take 
out the pork ; slice up four onions very fine ; fry 
them slowly until they are soft ; break up nine 
crackers fine ; put to soak in milk ; twenty minutes 
before dinner set the soup-pot on the fire ; put in 
the pork, onions, crackers, pepper, and salt ; turn 
the water and potatoes in ; stir it up ; rub together 
half a cup of fine cracker crumbs, a quarter of a 
pound of butter (having taken the black heads off 
of the clams) ; stir in the butter and clams ; boil 
slowly fifteen minutes. This makes a very superior 
clam chowder. 

FRIED COD AND HADDOCK. 

Cut the fish in pieces about the size to help to

each person (always wash fish in salt and water, and 
wipe it dry) ; have ready an egg beat up on ono 
plate, and some fine bread or cracker crumbs on 
another ; lay the fish in the egg, then in the crumbs ; 
have the fat or lard about two inches deep, quite 
hot ; fry the fish a light brown. Serve with 
drawn butter. 

FRESH TONGUES AND SOUNDS. 

Fried in the same manner. 

SALT TONGUES AND SOUNDS. 

Put them into cold water, and boil them until 
tender. 

BOILED BASS. 

Scrape off the scales; wash it. in salt and water; 
lay it into the fish-kettle, with boiling water enough 
to cover it. Boil it half an hour, if weighing six or 
eight pounds. 

BAKED BASS. 

The same as baked cod. 

BAKED PICKEREL. 

The same as above. 

FRIED FLOUNDERS. 

Scrape them clean; take off the heads; wash 
them in salt and water ; wipe them dry ; gash them 
crosswise ; lay them into hot fat. Fry a light brown, 
or broil as codfish. 



pish. 233 

PRIED OYSTERS. 

Get large sized oysters. Have an egg beat up on 
a plate, and cracker crumbs oh another; take each 
oyster on a fork ; dip it first in the egg, and then the 
crumbs ; prepare your oysters. Have the fat hot, 
drop in the oysters, and fry them a nice brown. 

SCULLOPS. 

These are best fried. Dip them into egg and 
crumbs ; have ready a deep pan full of hot lard ; fry 
them quickly ; have a small skimmer to take them 
from the fat ; put them into a cullender, and keep 
them hot until all are fried. 

SALMON PIE. 

Three and a half pounds of salmon. Boil as for 
the table. Take out the bones, and mash it fine. 
Add about one third more mashed potato than fish ; 
quarter pound of butter ; one quart of cream ; salt* 
Pill the pie dish ; brush the top with the yolk of an 
egg, and bake one hour. Serve with it egg sauce, 
or lemon cut in dice form in the sauce. 

Cod can be used instead of salmon. 

STEWED LOBSTER ON TOAST, C^ 

Chop a nice fresh lobster weighing about six 
pounds quite fine; put it into a saucepan, with a 
large cup of cream, a piece of butter the size of a 
cup, a little salt, and cayenne pepper to flavor pretty 

20* 



234 fish. 

strong ; stir this up ; heat it hot (do not lot it stand 
to fry) ; have ready some slices of toast cut rather 
thick, and buttered ; turn the lobster over it, and 
serve it hot. Sprinkle a little coral over it. 

THE CORAL OR ROB OP LOBSTER 

Should be always taken out, washed, and wiped 
dry. Grated fine, it is a great improvement 
sprinkled over any dish made. of lobster; or with 
hard boiled eggs and parsley, for any dish of fish. 

STEWED EELS. 

Cut the eels in pieces about four inches long ; 
wash them clean, and wipe them dry ; sprinkle a 
little salt and pepper over them. Cut three or four 
slices of salt pork, and fry them a nice brown ; slice 
an onion, and fry that brown ; dredge in a little 
flour ; lay in the eels, and let them fry a little ; add 
ono cup of hot water; cover them close, and let 
them stew twenty minutes. 

SWORD-PISH 

Is best sliced and boiled, or stewed like tautog. 

SOFT CRAB. 

Wash clean, wipe dry, and lay on to a gridiron ; 
broil about five minutes. 



MEATS. 235 



MEATS- 



BONED TURKEY. 



Take a young hen turkey weighing about ten 
pounds ; clean it well, and wipe it dry ; lay it on a 
meat-board. With a sharp knife split down the 
back ; with a small, sharp-pointed knife take out all 
the bones, beginning at the wing ; press the knife 
close to the bone, cutting slowly ; be careful'not to 
cut the skin. After cutting the bones from the 
wings, cut to the breast-bone and draw out the bones 
of the breast and wings ; then cut round the leg. 
After drawing out all the bones, wash the turkey, 
and wipe it dry ; have ready a stuffing made of very 
fine chopped veal, two sausages, bread crumbs, mace, 
pepper, salt, sweet herbs, and a little ham or tongue, 
two raw eggs ; add a few truffles or mushrooms if 
you like (a few strips of cold boiled tongue, a few 
strips of very tender cold veal, laid into the turkey 
lengthwise, intermixed with the dressing, is a great 
improvement to the appearance when cut) ; mix this 
up well ; lay the turkey on the meat-board ; lay the 
dressing on, filling the wings, legs, and breast ; with 
a strong, fine twine and meat-needle sew up the 
turkey.. Form it as well as possible with your hands ; 
skewer down the wings, tie down the legs. Break 
up two calf's feet, with the bones of the turkey, a 
little mace, pepper, salt, a carrot and an onion cut 



236 toEiTS. 

into small bits ; put all into a covered saucepan or a 
soup-pot with two quarts of water ; lay the turkey 
on to the bones; let it boil slowly three hours. 
Take up the turkey, strain out the bones, beat the 
whites of two eggs ; put the liquor back to boil ; add 
the eggs and shells, one lemon cut small, and a cup 
of whito wine ; let it boil about five minutes ; set it 
back ; add one cup of cold water ; let it stand fifteen 
minutes; strain the liquor through a flannel bag. 
Put a pint into a small mould to place on the breast 
of the turkey, the rest on a dish ; when cold cut the 
jelly in square pieces, and lay them round -the- turkey 
to garnish the dish. 

GREEN LEGGED PLOVER 

Are very fat, and almost as large as partridges. 
They should be roasted or broiled twenty or thirty 
minutes. 

WOODCHUCK 

Should bb stuffed, and roasted three quarters 
of an hour. 

HARE OR RABBITS, 

Stuffed and roasted, are very nice ; or fricasseed, 
or made into Die the same as pigeons. 

bear's meat 
Is best roasted or broiled, like beef or veinson. 

chicken pates. 
Boll a nice puff paste about quarter of an inch 



MEATS. 237 

thick ; cut it with a pretty-shaped paste-cutter ; lay 
it on a tin sheet, put a spoonful of the mince into 
the middle, cut another piece of paste the same size 
and shape and lay over it. Brush this over with the 
white of an egg, and bake it in a quick oven about 
fifteen minutes. 

Six or eight of these make a very pretty dish. 

PATTIES Itf PASTE. 

Make a nice puff paste ; roll it very thin ; cut it 
into handsome shapes. Have ready some minced 
chicken or veal, seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, 
and the yojk of an egg ; lay this between two pieces 
of paste ; fry them in hot lard. Serve them stand- 
ing in a dish resting on each other. 

MUTTON CHOP WITH TOMATOES. 

Take about a dozen mutton chops, with the email 
bones in thorn ; pound them a little vith the cleaver 
to make them smooth ; roll them in egg and crumbs ; 
fry them a light brown. Place some baked tomatoes 
in the centre of a dish and the chops round them, 
with the bones meeting over the top. 

BRESLAN OF BEEF. ' 

Mince some cold roast beef and a little tongue 
very fine ; season it with a little pepper, salt, and 
one egg ; put it into a pretty-shaped mould ; turn it 
out op to a tin sheet ; brush it over with an egg ; set 
it into the oven to brown. 



238 MEATS. 

GRATED HAM. 

Take the under part of a cold ham, which is rather 
hard to eat, and grate it up like cheese ; put it into 
a stone jar. This is very nice for seasoning. 

DROPPED EGGS WITH HAM. 

Have a small pan of hot water ; drop the eggs in 
carefully so as not to break the yolk ; with a spoon 
dip the hot water on to the yolk until a white skin 
forms over it ; then with an egg-slice take the eggs 
out carefully, one at a time. Drop the eggs on but- 
tered toast ; rub the egg lightly with a littje butter ; 
sprinkle over it a little grated ham or flour. Send 
to table plain. 

FRIED HAM AND EGGS. 

Have a slice from the middle of the ham ; cut the 
rind, not the fat, off with a sharp knife ; rub the pan 
with a very little butter ; lay the ham in ; it will 
fry in its own fat. When the ham is done, that is, 
when the fat part is brown on both sides, take it up. 
If you have any fat that is dripped from a roast ham 
(that is best), put three or four large spoonfuls of it 
into the frying-pan ; when it is quite hot, break the 
eggs into it very carefully, one at a time ; with a 
spoon dip the fat on to the egg till you see a white 
skin form over it, then with an egg-slice lift it out so 
as not to break the egg. Lay the ham on the dish, 



MEATS. 239 

and the eggs round it. A dish of handsomely fried 
ham and eggs looks very tempting, but if the eggs 
are broken or fried hard, it is scarcely fit to eat 

FRIED OR BROILED SALT PORK. 

Cut the slices even, not too thick ; cut the rind a 
little about two inches apart ; lay them into a clean 
frying-pan ; fry a nice yellow brown, first on one 
side and then on the other. Or, lay the slices on a 
gridiron, and broil both sides. 

PIG'S FEET STEWED. 

Half a dozen pig's feet into a saucepan; cover 
them with water ; season them with pepper and salt, 
and an onion chopped fine, and a table-spoonful of 
vinegar. Stew them half an hour. Serve feet and 
gravy in the same dish. 

BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS. 

Out up six onions ; fry them in a saucepan in but- 
ter until a nice brown ; turn in half a cup of hot 
water ; dredge in a little flour, pepper, salt ; broil a 
beefsteak, lay it into the pan with the onions, cover 
it tight, and let it stew about five minutes. Serve it 
very hot. 

BEEF PUDDING. 

Line a pudding mould with a good paste crust ; 
scald and skin about a half of a beef kidney ; cut in 



240 SALADS. 

small pieces ; chop fine one onion ; cut not very 
thin slices of tender beefsteak ; season with cayenne 
pepper, salt, a very little cloves ; put into the mould. 
Add a cup of good beef stock ; cover the pudding 
with the crust ; put on the cover of the mould, set 
into the steamer to steam two or three hours, de- 
pending on the size. 



SALADS. 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

A paib of fowl weighing about six pounds will 
make a nice dish of salad. The chickens should be 
well boiled. Take off all the skin (some persons do 
not use the dark meat ; it is quite as tender as the 
white, and when dressed, does not show the differ- 
ence) ; chop the meat very fine (be sure to take out 
all the little bits of gristle or sinews). Out up three 
good heads of tennis-ball lettuce into quarters ; wash 
it all clean, and lay it in ice-water for two or three 
hours, that it may be crisp. If celery is used, split it 
fine, and put into Ice-water as long as you would the 
lettuce, as it must be brittle to be good. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

Gut the lobster in small pieces, but do not chop it 
(if there is a roe or coral, as it is called, in the 



SALADS. 241 

lobster, wash it clean in cold water, wipe it dry, and 
grate it on a plate, and use it to ornament the salad). 
Put as much dressing as you think will eat well with 
the lobster; mix it up well with a fork and spoon ; 
then turn on a veiy little vinegar; mix this well, 
and place it on a flat dish. Wipe the celery or 
lettuce as dry as possible, and lay it round the dish. 
This I do for dinner, that persons may be helped 
to either lobster and lettuce, or lobster alone, which 
some prefer. 

CHICKEN SALAD, 

Made by not chopping or cutting the chicken, is 
very nice. Either boiled or roast chicken may be 
skinned, then pull the meat off the bone in small 
pieces, and dress it the same as other chicken salad. 
The chicken must be cooked very tender to pull off 
in nice pieces. For evening company it is best to 
cut the lettuce or celery, and mix with the meat or 
lobster, and serve it in a salad bowl. 

TO MAKE THE DRESSING. 

Take two hard-boiled eggs, lay them into cold 
water until quite cold ; put the yolks into a small 
wooden bowl; mash the eggs very find with the 
back of a spoon (I keep a wooden spoon and bowl 
for this purpose) ; add the yolks of two raw eggs, 
one large teaspoonful of salt, one large table-spoonful 
of dry mustard, a very little cayenne pepper; stir 
this well, always one way ; when well mixed, add a 

21 



242 SALADS. 

very little sweet oil, stirring all the time ; after this 
is mixed well, put in more, very little at a time, 
until you have used a third of a bottle ; then add a 
large spoonful of vinegar or lemon juice ; then more 
oil as before, using in all two thirds of a bottle of 
oil ; then another spoonful of vinegar. When well 
mixed, it must be very light and a nice color. Set 
it on the ice for two or three hours. Not more thau 
twenty minutes before using the salad mix it, and 
prepare for the table by putting with the mfcat about 
half of the dressing ; stir it up well ; then turn on to 
the meat one wineglass of the best of vinegar ; stir 
this up well ; it will turn the chicken very white. 
If it requires a little more salt, add it now. Place 
the chicken in the centre of a flat dish large enough 
to lay the lettuce or celery round the meat. Wipe 
the lettuce as dry as you can, and lay it round the 
meat with a spoon ; put the rest of the dressing on 
the lettuce or celery. 

THE SALAD DRESSING 

May be kept a week by putting it into a stone jar 
covered close, and keeping it in the ice-chest. 

It is very convenient to place a glass jar of the 
dressing on the table with a dish of lettuce and a 
lobster opened, and served plain ; or if you wish to 
make a salad quickly, in case of unexpected com- 
pany, it helps to enlarge the dinner. 

Cold boiled potatoes or beets sliced, or a white 
cabbage cut fine and laid in ice-water, all make nice 
salads. 



SALADS. 243 

A good dressing may be made without eggs to be 
used immediately, but will not keep as the other. 
Use two very good boiled mealy potatoes instead of 
eggs ; mix it the same as the egg dressing. 

MOYONAIES OP SALMON. 

Boil the salmon as you would to serve plain ; take 
up on to a dish ; take out all the bone with a knife ; 
take off all the skin ; put it into a deep dish ; spread 
over it a little pepper, salt, a few cloves ; just cover 
it with vinegar, and let stand until wanted. It is 
better to remain in the spice and vinegar over night. 
Lay on to the dish it is to be served on ; have the 
dressing the same as for lobster ; cover the salmon 
with a plenty of dressing ; have the salad the same 
as for lobster. This is a very nice dish — more of a 
variety than lobster, therefore more fashionable. A 
bass or cusk dressed in the same way is very good. 
Salmon trout is quite as good as salmon. 

Any kind of cold boiled fish left of a previous 
dinner, prepared in this way, is a piece of economy. 

A VEAL SALAD. 

Take a shin of veal, put it into an iron pot with 
six quarts of water ; add a little mace, pepper, and 
salt ; let it boil six hours. The water will bo almost 
absorbed ; pick out all the bones, and season it very 
well with ground mace, cinnamon, pepper, and salt ; 
add two teacups of very fine cracker crumbs ; stir 
them up well. Take a melon-shaped mould, cut 



244 VEGETABLES. 

three hard-boiled eggs iu strips lengthwise, rub the 
mould with a little of the juice of the meat, place the 
eggs round the sides of the mould, and fill it with 
the mixture, and set it away in a cool place. 

This is a very handsome dish to slice cold for a 
lunch or tea, or to place on a supper table, orna- 
mented with lettuce or celery. 



VEGETABLES. 

CUCUMBERS. 

Peel a fresh cucumber ; cut it in quarters length- 
wise ; roll them in cracker crumbs or flour ; season 
with pepper and salt ; fry them in hot lard. 

boiled cucumbers, 

To imitate asparagus. Gut a good-sized cucumber 
in small strips lengthwise ; lay them into cold water 
till crisp. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water ; 
tie the strips of cucumber together, as you do aspara- 
gus ; lay them into the water ; let it boil fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Dish it on a slice of buttered toast ; 
sprinkle over it a little salt and a little butter. - 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Cut them in two ; sprinkle a little salt over tnem ; 
let them stand two hours ; drain off all the water ; 



VEGETABLES. 24t> 

season with pepper, salt, and a little bit of butter oi> 
each half; set them into the oven to bake about 
half an hour. 

BAKED TOMATOES WITH MEAT DBESSING. 

Cut off the stalk end of the tomato ; with a spoon 
take out the inside ; put it into a small sieve to drain 
out the water, as that is bitter ; add a little veal or 
chicken chopped very fine, or cold sweet-breads, pep- 
per, salt, a very little mace, a little butter, drop in 
one raw egg ; mix this up ; fill the tomatoes ; cover 
each one with bread crumbs ; let them bake about 
twenty minutes. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Pick out the smoothest tomatoes ; cut off the stalk 
end ; take out the pulp with the spoon ; mix it with 
a few bread crumbs, a little salt, pepper, butter, and 
a little sugar if you like ; put this back into the 
skin ; place them in a shallow tin pan ; bake them 
about twenty minutes. 

TOMATO OMELET. 

One quart tomatoes chopped fine (after the skin is 
removed), and put into a saucepan with two finely 
chopped onions, a little butter, salt, and pepper, one 
cracker pounded fine ; cover tight, and let it simmer 
about an hour. Beat five eggs to a froth ; have 
your griddle hot ; grease it well. Stir your eggs 
into the tomato, beat together, and pour on to the 

21* 



246 VEGETABLES. 

griddle ; brown on one side, fold, and brown on the 
other. To be served hot. 

EGG PLANT. 

Cut it in thin slices ; sprinkle with a little salt, 
pepper, and flour ; drop a small piece of butter into 
the frying-pan ; when it is hot lay in the plant ; fry 
it a nice brown on both sides. 

EGG PLANT IN BATTER. 

Make a batter with an egg, a cup of flour, a little 
salt, water enough to make a thin batter. Dip the 
slices of plant into the batter, then fry them in hot 
fat a light brown. 

BAKED EGG PLANT. 

Cut off the stalk end about an inch and a half ; 
scrape out the inside with a spoon ; mix with this a 
boiled onion chopped fine, a cupful of fine-chopped 
meat of any kind, half a cup of bread crumbs well 
seasoned with pepper, salt, and spice of any kind ; 
drop in one raw egg ; mix this all up well ; fill the 
plant. Bake it half an hour. 

POTATO RICE. 

When boiling potatoes some are apt to get broken ; 
throw the pieces into a cullender ; rub them through 
with a spoon into a dish ; set it into the oven for five 
minutes. Dish as a vegetable, or garnish a tongue 
by laying it round the dish.

VEGETABLES. 247 

Eggs prepared in the same way make a pretty 
garnishing for side dishes of light meats. 

MACCARONI AS A VEGETABLE. 

Break up a vegetable dish half full of maccaroni 
in small pieces. Lay them in a saucepan, just cover 
them with water ; when hot, add half a pint of milk ; 
let it boil half an hour ; add a piece of butter half 
the size of an egg, a little salt, if you like, a table- 
spoonful of grated cheese ; stir this up, and serve in 
a vegetable dish. 

PEARS AS VEGETABLES, 

Or used instead of apple or cranoerry sauce. 
Take about two quarts of water that corned beef is 
boiling in ; put it into a saucepan with six good iron 
pears ; boil them an hour and a half. These are 
nice with corned beef. 

POTATO BALLS. 

Mash eight nicely boiled potatoes ; add a little 
salt, butter half the size of an egg, two spoonfuls of 
cream ; stir it well ; roll it with your hands into 
balls ; roll them in egg and crumbs ; fry them in 
hot fat, or brown them in the oven. 

Sweet potatoes should always be baked, as boiling 
in water spoils them. 

TO KEEP TOMATOES FOR WINTER USE. 

Get your tomatoes as soon as well ripened ; put 



248 VEGETABLES. 

them into wooden tubs, turn on boiling water, cover 
them up, and let them stand one hour. Then 
with a knife peel them, and lay them into pans ; 
sprinkle in some salt, then some tomatoes and more 
salt; set them in a cool place over night. In the 
morning turn off the water ; put the tomatoes in the 
preserving kettle to boil ; be sure they boil. .Have 
ready the cans, by filling them with hot water until 
hot, then turn out the water. Set them into hqt 
water while filling, as it is very important to exclude 
the air entirely. It takes two persons to put them 
up well, one to fill the cans and the other to stop 
them up tight while hot. I use Knight's improved 
cans ; they are much less trouble, and if put up 
carefully, I think it as good as soldering. Any kind 
of can is good which keeps out the air entirely. 

PUTTING UP SWEET CORN. 

Use the very best young corn ; put it to boil 
fifteen minutes ; with the handle of an iron spoon 
scrape all the corn from the cob ; then put the corn 
to boil with a little water, just enough to keep it 
from burning. When boiling hot, put it into tin 
cans, and seal them immediately. When wanted to 
use, put it into a saucepan with a very little milk, 
butter, and salt ; cook it fifteen minutes.

Wash the butter in cold water ; slap it into a thin 
cake, and lay it on the ice to get perfectly cold. To 
a pound of butter take a pound of flour ; mix half 
of the butter with the flour, wet with ice-water just 
enough to stick it together ; roll it out to half an 
inch thickness, put on half of the butter that remains 
in small bits ; dredge this with flour ; roll up the 
paste, then roll it out again, thin ; put on the rest of 
the butter ; roll it up and out again three or four 
times. The more it is rolled the more flaky it will 
be. This must be done quickly, taking care not to 
handle it any more than you can possibly help. Put 
it on the ice to keep cool until the filling for the 
pies is prepared. Butter the plates, then roll out 
the covering of the plates, and put it on them. 
Then roll a long strip to cut for the rims ; brush 
over the rim with cold water, with a paste brush, and 
between each layer. This makes the paste more 
puffy. Fill the pies; cover them with the crust 
rolled quickly ; brush the top with the white of an 
egg beat up. This gives a glossy appearance when 
baked. Bake in a quick oven. 

A PASTE TO KEEP ON HAND. 

Take two cups of butter, one of lard, &ix cups of

flour ; with a knife cut the butter and lard into the 
flour ; add a little ice-water ; keep cutting with a 
knife until you work it into a paste. Sprinkle a lit- 
tle flour on the paste-board, roll out the paste, then 
roll it up ; then roll again ; roll it up in a clean 
cloth, and lay it on the ice to keep. When wanted 
for use, roll out the paste, spread on a little butter, 
dredge on a little flour ; roll it up ; then roll it out 
again. This should be repeated five or six times, 
and you will have a very nice puff paste for vol-au- 
vent, patties, or anything that paste is recommended 
for.

LEMON PIE, OB PUDDING. 

Take four lemons, grate the rind, squeeze the 
juice, and chop the pulp very fine ; four teacups of 
sugar, the yolks of six eggs, two teacups of milk, four 
table-spoonfuls of corn starch ; beat these well to- 
gether ; put it into deep pie-plates ; line with puff 
paste; fill, and bake about half an hour. Beat 
the white of the eggs with six table-spoonfuls of 
white sugar to a froth ; when the pies are baked, 
put the froth over them, and set them in the oven 
for five minutes.

Boil one quart of milk, turn it on to the egg ; strain 
it into a pitcher ; set it into a kettle to boil, stirring 
it constantly until it thickens. Turn the pudding 
from the mould into a large pudding-dish ; turn the 
sustard round it. Serve two spoonfuls of custard 
with a slice of pudding. Half this quantity will 
make a good-sized pudding. 

CHOCOLATE CUSTARD. 

Beat separately the whites and yolks of seven 
eggs ; add to the yolks quarter of a pound of white 
sugar; stir the whites into the yolks. Dissolve a 
quarter of a pound of chocolate in a pint of hot milk ; 
add one pint and a half of cream ; give it one boil ; 
turn it on the egg, stirring it all the time. Strain it 
into a pitcher; set the pitcher into boiling water, 
stirring the custard constantly until it thickens. To 
be served in glasses to eat cold.

TO ORNAMENT CHOCOLATE CUSTARDS. 

Boil the milk ; beat up the whites of the eggs ; lay 
it with a spoon in lumps on to the milk ; let it harden 
a little ; skim it off, and put it on a sieve. Make 
your custard with the yolks ; when you turn the 
custard into glasses, lay on to each a spoonful of 
the whites. 

COLD CUSTARD. 

Put a quart of milk to warm ; flavor it with 
vanilla ; add a little sugar ; turn it into a deep dish 
that you wish to serve it in ; add a large spoonful of 
wine that has been prepared with rennet ; stir it up 
well ; let it stand in a cool pl^ce for two hours. 
Served with sugar and cream, this is very healthy 
for children. 

TO PREPARE RENNET. 

Take a dried rennet, wash it clean of the salt ; 
cut in pieces about one inch square ; put it into a 
quart bottle ; fill the bottle with white wine. This 
will keep two years. 

BERRY PUDDING. 

Make some cream of tartar dough the same as for 
biscuits ; roll it very thin ; line the bottom of a pud- 
ding-mould (a Charlotte Russe mould is a very nice 
shape) ; then put in a layer of any kind of berries, 
then another layer of dough, another of berries, and 
so on until the mould is full. Put it into a steamer, 
and let it steam four hours, or according to the size 
of the pudding. Serve it with a rich sweet sauce.

APPLE PUDDING. 

Made the same as above, with stewed apples in- 
stead of berries. 

RECEIPT FOB MAKING BREAD PUDDING. 

In making any kind of a bread pudding, it is much 
nicer to put what eggs you wish to put into the pud- 
ding into the milk ; turn that on to the bread to 
soak until soft. The pudding will be much lighter 
than to soak the bread in milk and then add 
the eggs. 

BOILED BREAD PUDDING. 

Take a stale baker's loaf ; cut it in slices ; lay two 
slices in a pudding-mould, then half a cup of dry 
currants, a layer of bread, then of currants, until the 
mould is nearly full. Beat up six eggs and a cup 
of fine white sugar ; stir them into a quart of cold 
milk ; season with a -little peach or vanilla ; turn 
this on to the bread ; let it stand and soak two or 
three hours, then steam it two hours. Serve with 
hot sweet sauce. 

BAKED BREAD PUDDING. 

Take stale rolls, butter a pudding-dish, lay in as 
many rolls as will fill the dish. Beat up six eggs to 
a quart of milk, a cup of white sugar, a little spice 
of any kind ; turn this into the dish ; lay a plate

over the rolls to press them down into the milk ; let 
them stand four or five hours ; bake about one hour. 
Serve with cold sauce. 

BAKED HUCKLEBERRY PUDDING. 

One quart of huckleberries, one teaspoonful of 
soda dissolved in one pint of molasses, one teaspoon- 
ful each of cloves, allspice, ginger, and cinnamon, 
three cups of flour ; stir all together. Butter a 
dish that will just hold it, and bake it two hours. 
Serve with sweet sauce. 

ANOTHER HUCKLEBERRY PUDDING. 

Make some cream of tartar dough, the same as for 
biscuits ; roll it very thin. Line the bottom of a 
pudding-mould (a Charlotte Russe mould is a very 
nice shape) ; then put in a layer of any kind of 
berries or stewed apple, then another layer of dough, 
then another of berries, and so on until the mould 
is full. Put it into a steamer, and let it steam four 
hours, or according to the size of the pudding. 
Serve it with rich sweet sauce. 

HUCKLEBERRY HOLLOW. 

Make a nice potato paste ; take a pudding-dish, 
lay over it a pudding-cloth, spread the paste in the 
cloth ; pour the berries into the centre of it ; gather 
the cloth in a bunch, tie it, and boil the pudding 
three hours. Serve it hot with a wine sauce.

CORN PUDDING. 

r 

Grate one dozen ears of green corn ; beat into it 
four eggs, one table-spoonful of butter, one quart of 
sweet milk, a little salt and pepper. Put the milk 
in last ; stir well together ; grease the pudding-dish, 
pour in the pudding, and bake it one hour. 

NANTUCKET CORN PUDDING. 

Eight ears of corn grated from the cob ; two soft 
crackers pounded fine; three eggs; one cup of 
sugar ; one pint of milk ; salt to the taste. Bake

crumbs, half cup of suet, two eggs, half tcaspoonful 
of soda, one cup of milk, one table-spoonful of brandy. 
Put this into a mould, and let it steam four hours. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Put six table-spoonfuls of flour into a dish with 
six eggs, a little salt, a gill of milk ; mix these well 
together with a wooden spoon ; add by degrees three 
gills more milk ; mix it up well. Put it in a tin dish 
that will just about hold the batter ; set under a 
piece of beef that is roasting about an hour before 
serving, until it sets and turns rather brown on top ; 
then turn it into the dish you intend to serve it in, 
and set it before the fire to brown on the other 6ide. 



256 CAKES. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLING. 

Boll out either potato or short paste ; cut it large 
enough to cover an apple peeled and cored. . When 
the apple is covered, place the dumpling on a tin 
baking-pan. Set in the oven to hake one hour, and 
served with wine sauce. 

PUDDING SAUCE. 

Beat to a cream half a pound of butter and half a 
pound of white sugar. It must be well beaten or 
your sauce will not froth. Boil a small tumbler of 
wine and one of water together ; stir this and the 
butter together very quickly ; it will be a perfect 
froth. Send it to the table as soon as made ; add a 
little nutmeg or essence of any kind. Do not put it 
on to the fire after it is mixed, or you will spoil the 
frothy appearance. 



CAKES. 



ON CAKE-MAKING. 



Always sift the flour, wash the butter, sift the 
sugar, break the eggs into a cup for fear there may 
be a bad one, stone raisins, wash and dry currants, 
cut citron in small pieces. When commencing, 
have all the materials ready and weighed or meas- 
ured, and the pans buttered, that you may keep 
beating until the cake is ready for the oven ; you 



CAKES. £57 

are more likely to have good cake, than if obliged to 
beat a little, and then take your hands put to pre- 
pare other ingredients. Line your cake pans with 
buttered paper, the cake is not so apt to burn ; it is 
well to have a clean paper ready to put on the top 
if the oven is too hot. In putting the materials to- 
gether, butter and sugar should be beaten together, 
and eggs beaten separately, as the whites need more 
beating than the yolks. Butter the pans, as any 
other fat may leave an unpleasant flavor. 

ICEING FOB .CAKE. 

The whites of two eggs to a pound of very fine 
white sugar, with a very little vanilla or orange- 
flower water ; beat them together until very light. 
Have ready in a cup a little lemon juice. Begin to 
lay on the iceing in a very thin coat with a knife ; 
occasionally dip the knife into the juice ; when it is 
covered, set it in a warm place to harden, then it 
will be ready for the next coating, which will be 
much smoother and whiter than the first. 

ALMOND LOAF CAKE.

butter, beat to a cream ; ten eggs beat separately ; one 
wineglass of brandy ; one nutmeg ; one cup of cream ;

two pounds Smyrna raisins. Bake in small or large 
loaves, and frosted if you like. 

ALMOND CAKE.

butter, beat to a cream ; add the yolks of seven eggs 
well beaten, one wineglass of brandy, a little salt, 
one pound of flour, six ounces of almonds pounded 
very fine, dried and sifted ; beat this all well to- 
gether ; whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, 
and mix with the rest. Put the cake into a tin pan, 
about an inch thick ; bake it a light color. Have 
ready four ounces of almonds chopped fine, two 
ounces of sugar, and the white of one egg beaten to 
a strong froth. When the cake is nearly done 
spread this over the top, and set it back to finish 
baking. 

WEDDING CAKE. 

Fifteen pounds of sugar, fifteen pounds of butter, 
fifteen of flour, fifteen of raisins, one hundred and 
five eggs, thirty pounds of currants, seven pounds of 
citron, five nutmegs, five ounces of mace, five tea- 
spoonfuls of cloves, one pint of molasses, one pint of

bake on tin sheets. 

BERWICK SPONGE CAKE. 

Two cups fine white sugar and seven eggs beaten 
well together ; add one teaspoonful of soda, dissolved 
in a teacupful of cold water; two teaspoonfuls cream 
tartar, stirred into four cups of flour. Stir the 
flour into the rest just enough to mix it well. Bake 
it iii a quick oven half an hour ; try it with a broom 
straw; if done, the straw will come out clean, if not, 
the cake will stick to the straw. You must not take 
the cake out of the oven to try it, as it will not be 
light if removed from the oven before it is baked 
enough. 

GOLD CAKE. 

Three quarters of a pound of butter, one pound 

of fine white sugar, the yolks of sixteen eggs, the 

rind and juice of one lemon, a little mace, one cup

DOUGHNUTS. 

Rub six ounces of butter in two pounds of flour ;

cakes, place them close together in the pans, let 
them rise again until very light. Bake them about 
half an hour. When done, have ready a spoonful 
of milk and molasses mixed ; with a paste brush, 
brush over the bunns while hot, and set them back

this at night ; in the morning put in the eggs and 
sugar, at noon the currants, and make the dough 
into cakes ; then set theqi to rise until time to bake 
for tea. 



PKESERVE& 

BRANDT PEACHES. 

Turn boiling water over the peaches ; let them 
6tand, covered up tight, twenty minutes ; with a 
cloth take off all the skin. Have ready a syrup of 
half the weight of fruit ; put just enough peaches to 
swim on the top ; let them boil fifteen minutes ; 
take them out on a dish to cool them. To a quart 
of syrup, put one quart of brandy. Put the peaches 
into the jars; cover them with the brandy and 
syrup, and cover them very tight, to exclude all the 
air at a time, until you have boiled them. 

APRICOTS AND PLUMS. 

The same as peaches.

266 PRESERVES. 

BRANDY PEARS. 

Peel theni with a knife very nice and even to look 
well ; boil tbem in water fifteen minutes ; lay them 
on a flat dish to cool. Make a syrup half the weight 
of the fruit ; put the pears in to boil fifteen minutes ; 
let them cool. Put them into the jars ; fill the jars 
half full of syrup and the rest white brandy. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Take a very strong thin cloth ; mash the currants 
with your hands until they are thoroughly broken ; 
then put as many into the cloth as you can squeeze 
by taking each end of the cloth ; wring them very- 
hard. Two persons can do much better than one, 
for it requires a great deal of strength. When the 
juice is all extracted, measure a pound of sugar to a 
pint of juice ; let it boil about fifteen minutes ; 
strain it into the jars. Small jars are best for jelly ; 
let them stand uncovered exposed to the sun for 
three or four days. Wet a paper with brandy ; lay 
on the top of the jelly. Cut paper large enough to 
tie down round the jar ; brush the paper over with 
the white of an egg ; with your finger press it down 
close and tie it tight, — or a bladder is still better. 

CANNING FRUIT, OR PRESERVING PEACHES. 

I always use the best of fruit for preserving. 
Take nice free-stone peaches, rather hard ; lay them 
into a pan ; turn on boiling water enough to cover 
them : cover them tight to keep the steam in ; let 



PRESERVES. 267 

tliom stand until the water is cool enough for you 
to handle them ; peel them with your fingers rather 
than a knife. Allow three pounds of sugar to nine 
pounds of fruit ; put the sugar into the preserving- 
kettle, with one cup of the water that the peaches 
were scalded in ; set it on the fire, and stir it until 
the sugar is melted. Put in as many peaches as the 
svrup will cover ; let them boil about fifteen minutes. 
Rinse the cans out with boiling water to heat them. 
Put the peaches boiling hot into the cans ; set the 
cans in hot water while filling ; pour the syrup over 
them, and cover them tight. These will keep as 
well as if one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 
Any kind of fruit may be done in this way. 

PRESERVED BARBERRY. 

To a pound of fruit a pound of good brown sugar. 
To a peck, one quart of cold water ; let it boil up 
once ; then set it aside, and let it simmer one hour. 
This is very nice to put into water to drink ; in case 
of sickness it is very cooling. 

EGG PLUMS. 

Turn on boiling water, and let them stand five 
minutes ; or put them into a cullender, set that into 
a deep pan, then turn on boiling water. As soon as 
the skin cracks, lift out the cullender and peel the 
plums. This will prevent breaking the plums by 
handling or moving them. Then make the syrup, 
pound for pound. Boil the fruit, and when done, 



r 



268 PRESERVES. 

lay thein on a flat dish to cool. Put them into jars, 
and pour the hot syrup over them. Close the jars 
tight. 

DAMSON PLUMS. 

Pick them over ; be sure they are clean ; leave 
the stems on. Make a syrup of one pound of sugar 
to one pound of fruit ; half a gill of water to a pound. 
When the syrup just boils, put in the plums ; let 
them simmer about three quarters of an hour. Put 
up in glass or china jars; stop tight. All small 
plums may be preserved in the same way. 

PIG TOMATOES. 

Get very fine small yellow tomatoes. Make a 
syrup of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; cut 
up one large lemon, or a cup of preserved ginger, to 
every pound. Boil the tomatoes until tender ; lay 
them on a dish to cool ; add the lemon or ginger to 
the syrup, and let it boil up once. Put the tomatoes 
in jars ; turn the hot syrup over them, and cover 
them tight. These will keep very well, being better 
the second season than when first done. 

THE STRAWBERRY TOMATOES, 

The same as above. 

STEWING DRIED FRUIT. 

Cover the fruit with cold water ; let it soak three 
or four hours; then let it boil until tender. Add 
sugar to the taste. Do not stir the fruit much while 
it is stewing, as it would break it, and make it un- 
sightly. 



ICE CREAM. 269 



ICE CREAM. 



PISTACHIO ICE CREAM. 



Six ounces of pistachio nuts scalded, peeled, and 
pounded fine ; twelve ounces of sugar ; the yolks of 
three eggs well beaten ; one table-spoonful of orange- 
flower water ; a pint and a half of milk, or cream ; 
mix all together, and put it into a saucepan to 
thicken, stirring all the time ; strain it into a bowl. 
Mix together two table-spoonfuls of spinach, greening, 
and half a pint of milk ; stir this into the rest until 
well mixed ; then freeze it like other cream* 

COFFEE ICE CBEAM. 

Half pound of the best of coffee ; one quart of 
boiling water turned on to it ; boil it five minutes. 
Stand it off the fire ; add one cup of cold water ; let 
it steep until perfectly clear; turn this into two 
quarts of boiling milk. Beat up nine eggs with one 
pound of white sugar ; flavor with vanilla. Strain 
the whole into the freezer, and when frozen put in 
moulds, and pack it in ice four or five hours. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. 

Dissolve half a pound of chocolate in a quart of 
good milk ; add a pound of sugar ; boil it until dis- 
solved ; stir it. on to six well beat eggs, boiling hot.

270 ICE CREAM. 

Add three quarts of cream ; flavor with almonds ; 
give it one boil. Strain the whole into the freezer. 
This is a rich ice cream. When frozen, put into 
moulds, and pack it in the ice four or five hours. 

CARAMEL CREAM. 

Put one pound of sugar with one gill of water ; 
boil it and stir it until it gets a light brown color. 
Stir this into one gallon of cream. Add sugar to the 
taste. Freeze this. If the sugar is well browned, 
you will not require any other flavor. 

ICE CREAM MADE OF MILK. 

Boil one quart of milk ; beat up four eggs ; mix 
with them two table-spoonfuls of arrowroot, turning 
the boiled milk into them ; stir it well ; add three 
quarts of cold milk, and two pounds of sugar, and 
the flavoring. The latter should be pretty strong, 
as the freezing destroys it in part. Strain before 
freezing. 

FRESH CURRANTS 

Make a very nice water ice. Take three or four 
quarts of fresh currants ; mash them ; strain out the 
juice ; add to it water and sugar enough to make it 
very rich. Freeze it. 

THE CREAM 

Or custard, for making frozen pudding, should be 
partly frozen before the pudding is put together. 



ICE CREAM. 271 

THE JUICE 

Of any kind of fresh fruit makes a nice water ice. 

FROZEN PUDDING. 

Freeze a cream of any kind as for ice cream, 
about hard enough to put into a mould (a melon- 
shaped mould is as pretty as any) ; place in the bot- 
tom of the mould any kind of preserved fruit, or 
large strawberries, about an inch apart; then a 
layer of ice cream ; then fruit, and a little pounded 
almonds ; then ice cream, and so on till the mould 
is full ; then cover it with a cloth, and put the tin 
cover on very tight. Pack it in salt and ice for four 
or five hours. 

Brandied fruit of any kind is nice in these pud- 
dings. 

ESSENCE OP SPINACH. 

Soak half a peck of fresh spinach in water ; drain 
it dry, and pound it well ; put it in a coarse cloth, 
and squeeze the juice into a small saucepan. Wheu 
it is nearly boiling strain it ; add a little fine sugar ; 
stir it until the sugar melts. When cold, bottle it ; 
it will keep some time to use for coloring. 



272 SWEET DISHES. 

SWEET DISHES. 

Cox's gelatine is the best for making wine jelly or 
blanc mange. The directions given by a printed 
paper at the top of each box is very reliable. 

CHARLOTTE BXJSSE. 

Put one ounce of Cox's gelatine to half a pint 
of milk to simmer. Beat the yolks of four eggs 
with four ounces of white sugar ; beat the four 
whites to a' strong froth ; one pint of thick cream, 
and one wineglass of white wine, to a strong froth. 
When the gelatine is dissolved, stir it into the eggs 
and sugar ; then add the whites, and then the cream, 
and beat them all together. Line the mould with 
lady-fingers, or split a sheet of sponge cake for it ; 
set it on the ice. When the cream is well set, that 
is, when it is a little thick, fill up the mould ; let it 
stand about five hours. Turn it out on to your dish. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM. 

Take one quart of milk or cream ; three squares 
of chocolate ; one ounce of gelatine ; half a cup of 
sugar. Scrape the chocolate fine ; stir it into the 
milk ; dissolve the gelatine in a cup of the milk. 
Beat up six eggs ; mix all together ; put it into a 
saucepan. Let it get very hot, but not to boil; stir 
it while heating. Strain it into a mould ; set it to 
cool five or six hours ; when cold, turn it into a dish. 
Whip up half a pint of cream, and lay it round the 
dish. 



BWEET DISHES. * 273 

CHOCOLATE BLANC MANGE. * 

Dissolve one paper of Cox's gelatine in a cup of 
milk ; scrape fine quarter of a pound of chocolate ; 
boil three pints of milk or cream ; stir into this the 
chocolate ; sweeten it to the taste ; add the gelatine. 
Strain it into a mould ; let it stand about four hours. 
Serve with sugar and cream. 

CARAMEL CREAM. 

Put a pound of sugar on to boil until it is almost 
candy ; then let it stand until it turns quite dark ; 
add this to cream as a flavor. It is good to flavor 
custards or blanc mange. Also, with whipped 
cream, it makes an ornament. 

ARROWROOT BLANC MANGE. 

Pour even table-spoonfuls of arrowroot wet with a 
little cold water, as in making starch ; turn a pint 
of boiling milk on to it, stirring all the time ; 
sweeten and flavor it to the taste. Turn it into the 
saucepan ; stir it all the time till it just boils ; then 
turn it into a mould, and set it to cool four or five 
hours. Serve with sugar and cream. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 

One cup of the best tapioca put to soak with a 
pint of cold water ; when perfectly soft, put it into a 
saucepan with one large cup of fine sugar, the rind 
and juice of one lemon, a little salt, one pint more 



274 MAKING PICKLES. 

water. Stir it until it boils ; turn it into a mould ; 
set it to cool five or six hours: Serve it with sugar 
or cream. 

ARROWROOT JELLY 

Is made in the same way, only using water instead . 
of milk. 

SAGO JELLY. 

Made the same as tapioca. 

COLD CUSTARD. 

Warm a quart of milk just milk-warm ; sweeten, 
and flavor it, to your taste. Turn into a dish to send 
to table. Stir into it two table-spoonfuls of rennet 
wine ; let stand about one hour. It is very nice to 
eat with sugar and cream. 

RENNET WINE. 

Get at the market a dried rennet ; cut it in pieces 
about two inches ; put it into a bottle, and fill the 
bottle with Maderia wine. This will keep two years. 



MAKING PICKLES. 



CUCUMBERS. 



Get very small cucumbers ; wipe them clean, and 
lay them into stone jars. Allow one quart of coarse 
salt to a pail of water ; boil the salt and water till 



MAKING PICKLES. 275 

the salt is dissolved ; turn it boiling hot on the cu- 
cumbers ; cover them* up tight, and let them stand 
twenty-four hours. Turn them into a basket to 
drain. Boil as much of the best cider vinegar as 
will cover the cucumbers ; wash out the jars, and 
put the cucumbers into them. Turn the vinegar on 
boiling hot ; cover them with cabbage leaves, and 
cover the jars tight. In forty-eight hours they will 
be fit for use. 

Pickles of any kind are good made in the same 
way. 

MANGOES. 

Gut out a small strip at the side, and take out the 
seeds ; fill them with very small onions, horse-radish, 
mustard-seed, cloves, and pepper-corns. Replace 
the piece taken out, and tie them up tight. Prepare 
them the same as cucumbers, only they should 
remain in the salt and water forty-eight hours in- 
stead of twenty-four. 

PICKLED CABBAGE. 

Take a red cabbage, cut it into thin slices, sprinkle 
it over with a little salt, and cover it with a good 
sharp vinegar. Let it stand two or three days. 

SWEET PICKLES. 

Two pounds of fruit ; one quart of vinegar ; one 
pound of sugar. Put the sugar and vinegar on to 
get hot ; skim it well. When it has boiled fifteen 



276 MAKING PICKLES. 

minutes put in the fruit, and let it boil till about 
half cooked ; then put them in jars, and dork them 
tight. For peaches a little cinnamon and mace may 
be boiled in the vinegar. Ifor plums, or dark fruit, 
allspice or cloves. 

PICKLED PEACHES. 

Rub the fuzz off the peaches with a coarse towel ) 
stick them full of cloves. Make a syrup, allowing 
half a pound of sugar to a pound 6f fruit ; let the 
peaches boil in it till they are tender ; then put 
them in jars. Add half a pint of good vinegar to a 
quart of syrup, and let it cover the peaches. 

SPICED CURRANTS. 

Seven pounds of currants ; four pounds of brown 
sugar ; six teaspoonfuls of cinnamon ; six teaspoon- 
fuls of cloves ; one pint of vinegar. Dissolve the 
vinegar and sugar ; then put the currants and spices 
in, and let them boil up once or twice, till the cur- 
rants look a little curly. Put them in glass bottles ; 
stop very tight. 

SPANISH PICKLE. 

Take one peck of small green tomatoes (the 
smaller the better) ; slice them rather thin ; lay 
them into a stone jar, in a layer about one inch 
thick ; sprinkle in a little salt, then a layer of to- 
matoes, then salt, and so on. Let them stand over 
night ; turn off the water, and put the tomatoes into 



MAKING PICKLES; 277 

a preserving-kettle; cover therm with good cider 
vinegar ; let this boil up once. Slice four ounces 
of horse-radish ; two ounces each of black and white 
mustard-seed and celery-seed ; one ounce of black 
pepper ; a teaspoonful of red pepper ; three quarters 
of a peck of very small onions, sliced. Mix all to- 
gether while your pickle is hot ; put it into a stone 
jar ; cover tight, and keep it in a cool place. 

PICKLED WALffUTS-. 

Pick the walnuts When green and soft; prick 
them well with a fork. Boil four pounds of salt to 
a gallon of water ; strain it clear ; put the walnuts 
into a firkin or stone jar ; turn the brine on them 
boiling hot ; let them stand two or three days in the 
sun if you can ; then drain them into a basket. 
Put the nuts back into the jar. Boil as much cider 
vinegar as will cover the pickles; to every gallon, 
add half an ounce of whole cloves, three oftnees of 
horse-radish, half an ounce of mustard-seed tied up 
in a little bit of muslin ; when all is boiling, turn 
it on to the nuts. Cover them tight. In two weeks 

they will be ready for use. 

/ 

- MAttTlNOES. 

Wipe them clean, and put them into a firkin. 
Put one quart of coarse strong salt to a pail of 
water ; boil and skim it, until the salt is all melted ; 
put this on to the martinoes, and let it stand two 
days and nights ; then drain them off; wash out the 

24 



278 MAKING PICKLES. 

firkin, and put the martinoes into it. Put to boil 
enough vinegar to cover them, and with it a small 
bag of cloves arid allspice ; turn the vinegar over the 
pickles boiling hot, and cover them closely. In two 
weeks they will be fit to eat, but better in two 
months. 

MIXED PICKLES. 

Break up a cauliflower, very tender string beans, 
and some very small onions ; a red pepper cut in 
small pieces; some little long greea pepper, and 
some little yellow tomatoes ; scald them in salt and 
water, and let them stand twenty-four hours. Drain 
them from that, and put them into a jar or pan ; 
turn boiling vinegar over them ; let them stand 
until cool enough to put into glass bottles ; stop them 
tight. 

In making pickles, the articles must be fresh- 
gathered, and use the best of cider vinegar, or you 
cannot have good pickles. 

PICKLED MACKEREL. 

Take four dozen of small mackerel (what are 
called tinkers) ; cut them open a little way to clean 
them, and wash them in salt and water ; lay them 
into a baking-pan. Sprinkle a plenty of fine salt, 
pepper, cloves, and allspice ; add vinegar enough to 
bake them in. Bake them about fifteen minutes ; 
lay them into a stone jar ; sprinkle a little salt 
between each layer. Have on the fire vinegar 
enough to cover the mackerel, with whole cloves and 



HOME-MADS WINE. 279 

allspice. When all the fish are baked and in the 
jar, turn the vinegar over them ; cover them tight. 
These are very nice to use as you would sardines for 
lunch. 9 

POTTED MACKEREL. 

Place a layer of small fish in a stone jar ; then 
sprinkle salt, whole peppers, cloves, and allspice ; 
then a layer of fish, and so on till the jar is nearly 
full. Then cover with vinegar, and put a paper over 
the top of the jar, and a paste made of rye meal. 
Bake it slowly four hours. Take off the crust ; do 
not allow any of it to fall into the fish ; keep covered 
close. These will keep six months. 



HOME-MADE WINE. 

PINE-APPLE CHAMPAGNE. 

Cut the rind off six good ripe pine-apples ; lay it 
into ajar with one gallon of cold water ; let it stand 
to ferment ; strain it ; sweeten it with loaf sugar to 
the taste. Bottle it, tie down the corks, and lay the 
bottles on the side. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

Put two quarts of raspberries into one quart of 
the best of wine vinegar ; let it stand in a cool place 
twenty-four hours ; strain it through a cloth to get 



280 fiOKE-MAM Wffi& 

all the juice ; put it into a prfcserving-kcttle, and 
when it almost boils skim it well, and add two 
pounds of loaf sugar ; dissolve it and skim it, then 
strain it. Bottle, and cork it tight ; it will keep a 
year. A spoonful of this in a glass of water is very 
cooling in summer. 

CURRANT WINS. 

Mash and squeeze the cuirants through a coarse 
strong cloth. To a gallon of juice> add one quart 
of water, two pounds of good loaf sugar ; stir this, 
and set it away in a large stone pot ; let it stand two 
weeks. There will be a thick scum ; take this all 
off, and add one pint of good rum or brandy ; put it 
in a demijohn ; stop it tight. 

CHERRY BOUNCE. 

For ten gallons, have a ten gallon keg half full of 
the very best new rum ; fill it full of black rum 
cherries fresh picked from the trees ; stop it tight. 
Let it stand until the next spring ; then drain off all 
the juice ; turn out the cherries ; put in two gallons 
of water, and let them soak until the next day. Put 
to the juice two pounds of loaf sugar to a gallon ; 
put it back into the keg. Wash out the cherries 
from the water, and strain it into the keg ; stop it 
tight ; let it stand until fall, and then bottle it. 

Uie brandy instead of rum if you prefer; but I 
think good rum is better than common brandy. 



H0MB-*ADE WINE. 281 

BLACKtfEflRt C0&DIAL. 

Place the berries in a kettle over the' fire, with a 
very small quantity of Water in the bottom of the 
kettle ; let them boil soft. Thefl strain them through 
a bag until the juice is all separated from the seed. 
Put the juice on the fire again, andf sweeten to the 
taste with white sugar ; throw in a little bag of stick 
cinnamon. Let it boil twenty minutes or half an 
hour ; take it off, and stir in the brandy or whiskey, 
making it as strong as desired. Bottle, and seal it 
with wax. 

If it is desired to make jam as well as cordial, 
merely dip or pour off the juice, not quite all, from 
the stewed berries. Then add a little water and 
sugar (brown if you please), and. stew them down 
for jam. 

GINGER CORDIAL. 

Pour pounds of red or white currants ; half pound 
of bruised ginger ; two ounces of bitter almonds ; 
the juice of three lemons, and the rind of one lemon. 
Put the above into a gallon of whiskey ; let it stand 
ten days ; then strain it twice, and add five pounds 
of white sugar. Bottle it for use. 

GINGER BEER. 

Two ounces of ginger ; one pint of molasses ; half 
a pint of good yeast ; one gallon of warm water. 
Put this into a stone jug ; shake it up well ; set it to 
rise for twelve hours ; then stop it tight, or bottle it. 

24* 



282 MISCELLANEOUS. 

DANDELION BEER. 

To a peck of dandelions, one pail of water ; put it 
into a pot to boil about two hours ; strain it into a 
jug or keg ; add one quart of molasses, and one 
pint of good yeast ; set it to rise twelve hours. Bot- 
tle it, and tie down the cork. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

LARDING. 

Larding is to cut salt pork in fine strips (you 
can find larding-needles at any kitchen furnishing 
store). You can see by that how thick the strips 
are to be, as they are to be put into the needle, and 
drawn through the meat about an inch apart, and 
one inch long. 

CRUMBS FOR SMALL BIRDS. 

Lay some fine crumbs into a baking-pan ; set them 
In the oven ; stir them often until a light brown. 
Take the pan from the oven ; add a little butter, 
stirring all the time until the crumbs hp,ve absorbed 
the butter, and look dry. Sprinkle these over any 
kind of small birds, and round them. They garnish 
the dish sufficiently.

MISCELLANEOUS. 283 

A NICE BROWNING. 

Put a pound of sugar into a saucepan ; let it 
melt, as if to make candy, and brown ; then add a 
pint of water ; stir it for about ten minutes. Turn 
this into a bottle, and stop it tight, and use it instead 
of soy to brown soups or gravies. 

CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

Take half a pound of chestnuts ; break off the 
shells ; turn on to the nuts a quart of boiling water ; 
let it stand ten minutes ; take off the brown skins. 
Put the nuts into a saucepan with a pint of white 
stock ; let them boil an hour and a half, or until soft 
enough to mash through a sieve ; then add a little 
lemon, cayenne, and half a pint of cream ; let it 
simmer, but not boil, stirring all the time until 
served. 

CHESTNUT DRESSING FOR TURKEY. 

Boil the chestnuts, peel them, mash them fine, 
and season them the same as dressing made of bread 
crumbs. The French chestnuts are less trouble 
because larger, but no better than any other. 

EGO SAUCE FOR FISH. 

Boil four eggs hard ; drop them into cold water ; 
when cold take off the shell ; take out the yolks ; 
chop the whites ; rub the yolks through a wire sievo 
or tin cullender. Put all the eggs into the sauce 
dish ; add one pint of drawn butter, a little pepper, 
salt, and lemon juice. 



284 MISCELLANEOUS. 

TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. 

Two small squares of chocolate ; cut it up fine , 
put into the chocolate pot ; turn on to it two cups 
of boiling water ; stir it up ; set it to boil ; theu add 
two cups of milk ; let it boil up once. Sugar to the 
taste. 

NEW YEAR'S EGG NOGG. 

Beat the yolks of five eggs and five table-spoonfuls 
of sugar together ; grate into this one nutmeg ; add 
half a pint of brandy, stirring constantly. Beat the 
whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and mix them 
nicely with the above ; then stir in one quart of good 
milk ; grate a little nutmeg over the top. 

OMELETTE FOR ONE PERSON. 

Beat three eggs very well, a very iittle salt, a lit- 
tle pepper. Put a bit of butter, not more than a 
tcaspoonful, into the omelette pan ; stir it round 
quickly; as soon as hot turn in the egg; keep the 
pan moving slightly. As soon as the egg is set, 
turn it half over, slip it on to a dish, and send it to 
the table hot. If it stands it is spoiled. 



USEFUL HINTS. 285 



USEFUL HINTS. 

k cook should always, when setting away what is 
hd>Z from dinner, be careful to put each meat by 
itself on a clean dish, and put the gravy with it, in 
order that she may be able to make a nice dish of 
what cold meats she has ; for it is very great economy 
to make a relishing dish of what she has left, without 
as much expense as a plain dish would cost. Some 
cooks think they must have all kinds of sauces to 
season a made dish ; but every dish is better to taste 
well of whatever it is made of, without the disguise 
of spices and sauces. I like a bright seasoning of 
onions and vegetables, a little spice, and some sauce, 
but not too much. We have so many vegetables, 
such as celery, parsley, mushrooms, besides so many 
dried sweet herbs, that we cannot be at a loss for 
good flavoring. But all these things must be used 
with good judgment. Some cooks use a great quan- 
tity of butfrr, but their cooking is not so good as if 
they used it more prudently ; too much butter spoils 
everything. You should try out the fat of poultry, 
and keep eacfc kind by itself to baste with. 

Pieces of staie bread should be kept clean and dry. 
Every two or three days put all the small pieces you 
have on a tin sheet, and set it in the oven with the 
door open to dry. When very dry, pound them fine, 
and sift them through a coarse sieve or fine cul- 



286 



USEFUL HINTS. 



lender. The fine crumbs are good to use in frying ; 
the coarse ones are good for puddings. The soft part 
of pieces of bread should be used for dressing for 
meats, which would save cutting a whole loaf for 
that purpose. If care is taken of the pieces of bread 
in a family, a great saving may be made, for bread 
is a large item in family expenses. Soft crackers 
pounded make the best crumbs to use in frying, also 
in scalloping oysters. 

The dripping of beef and pork, clarified, is very 
nice to fry in, instead of lard or butter. To clarify 
it, put the drippings into an iron pot ; to a quart of 
fat allow half a pint of cold water ; let it boil until 
the water is boiled out, which may be known by its 
not bubbling. When the water has evaporated, 
strain it into an earthen pot, and keep it in a cool 
place for use. 

The fat from soup stock, and all other fat that 
with proper care accumulates in a kitchen, may be 
used for making soft soap with but very little trouble, 
and a great saving may be made thereby, as it is 
much better than the soap that you get in exchange 
for your house grease. 



ON ROASTING MEAT. 



When roasting meat, have a clear good fire ; set » 
the tin-kitchen back from the fire; turn the spit 



USEFUL HINTS. 287 

often until the meat gets hot ; then baste with the 
drippings from it, or the fat of the same kind of meat 
that lias been clarified, for if you are not particular 
in this you cannot preserve the true flavor of the 
meat. 

Veal may be basted with a little butter for the last 
basting before dishing, as for poultry ; but beef and 
mutton with its own dripping from the tin-kitchen. 
Dredge on a little salt and a little flour, and baste 
well about twenty minutes before dishing, and tho 
meat will have a rich brown frothy appearance. 

FOB RESTORING MEAT. 

If a little spoiled, lay into a pan ; turn over it 
some good vinegar, rubbing it all over. Let it lay 
one hour ; then wash it out of this ; lay into cold 
water for one hour ; wipe it dry ; cook it. It will 
\>e perfectly sweet. 

TO SAVE COOKING PAT. 

Beef, pork, and veal drippings, that is, what you 
turn out of tin-kitchen or meat pan (leaving the last 
drippings to make the gravy for your meats, as I 
have before directed), that is fat. This you keep 
all together in a jar. Once a week put it into a 
saucepan ; add half a pint of cold water. Let it 
boil about twenty minutes, and then strain it into a 
jar. This is very good to use as you would butter, 
or to fry in cooking. 



288 USEFUL HINTS. 

TO SAVE SOAP GREASE. 

Keep a small earthen pot near the sink when you 
wash dishes ; scrape every little bit of fat into it 
Every day scrape this into a large pot until you get 
it full ; put this into a pot with a pint of cold water, 
and let it boil. Keep the pot covered tight, that 
you may not get the scent of it through the house. 
Keep an old cullender over the top of a firkin where 
the grease is nielted; turn it into the cullender. 
When the grease is strained out, put the rough 
grease into another firkin. This clean grease is 
what you may make soft soap with. The rough 
grease sells for -six cents per pound, if you do not 
wish tp make soap ; the clean grease may be sold 
for nine cents per pound. You perceive by this lit- 
tle care and trouble, your soap grease is worth half 
as much again as if it was all put into the firkin 
together. 

TO MAKE SOFT SOAP. 

Take seventeen pounds of potash, to twenty of 
grease; lay the potash at the bottom of the barrel. 
Boil the grease, and pour it on ; put in two pailfuls 
of scalding water, and stir it all together. Fill up 
the barrel the next morning with cold water ; stir it 
up from time to time, and in three days it will l# 
fit for use. 

ANOTHER SOFT SOAP. 

This answers for common purposes, but not so 
good for clothes as the former : — 



J 



CLEANING. 289 

Take three pots of concentrated lve (it comes in 
little tin pots) ; take off the tops, ana put them in a 
kettle that will hold three pailfuls ; add eight pounds 
of good grease, and two pailfuls of water ; let it boil 
until all the lye melts out of the cans. Put this into 
the soap barrel, and fill it up with hot water. This 
is much cheaper than potash soap. 



CLEANING. 



TO CLEAN MARBLE. 



tOW\A 



Take a little soft soap and pumice-stone on a 
flannel ; rub it all over, then wash <tt off, wipe dry, 
and rub it with a clean cloth.- But if it is spotted, 
send it to be repolished. 

TO CLEAN FURNITURE. 

For polished furniture : an equal quantity of 
spirits of turpentine, sweet oil, and beeswax, melted 
together. Wipe all the dust off; then rub some of 
this mixture on to a good, stout piece of woollen 
cloth ; rub the article well, and then polish it with 
some old soft silk. For varnished furniture : wipe 
the spots with a soft wet cloth ; wipe them dry. 
Then with a piece of cotton flannel dipped in a little 
sweet oil, wipe the article ; rub it clean with old 
silk. 

25 



290 CLEANING. 

CLEANING WINDOWS. 

Wash them first with warm water and a sponge ; 
then dry them with old linen, and rub them clear. 
Polish them with old newspaper. 

When cutting up old linen sheets, I take the best 
pieces, about the size of a towel, turn down the edge, 
and run it with a long stitch. It does not take long 
to do this, and it makes nice window cloths because 
not linty. 

CLEANING PAINT. 

With warm water, a little soda, soap, and very fina 
pumice-stone and a flannel cloth, rub the paint all 
over ; then rinse off the soap well, and wipe it dry. 
Always in cleaning paint rub up and down^ not 
crosswise or round and round. 

CLEANING SILVER PLATE. 

Take some good fine whiting wet with water (or 
if much tarnished, use alcohol) ; rub the article all 
over with a soft cloth dipped in the whiting (use a 
soft brush for the chased work) ; let it dry. Then 
have some hot water with silver soap, or good soda 
soap ; with a soft cloth wash off the whiting, and 
with a clean brush wash the whiting out of the 
chased work, and wipe quite dry with a clean old 
soft cloth while hot out of the water. Nothing will 
make silver look as well, and keep clean as long. 

In cutting up old table cloths, I hem the best 
pieces for wiping silver. The oldest are better for 
cleaning it than a sponge. 



CLEANING. 2&1 

FOB CLEANING TIN. 

Take fine house sand and soft soap ; a good piece 
of cotton flannel ; have a tub with some hot soap- 
suds and a clean cloth ; take the tins on a table ; 
rub hard with the soap and sand until you remove 
all the dingy appearance. Then put into the tub ; 
wash it clean from the soap and sand. Put them in 
the sun to dry, and when dry, polish with a clean 
cloth and a little dry whiting. 

CLEANING BRASS. 

Nothing so good as fine rotten-stone and sweet 
oil. Bub hard to take off all the spots ; then 'rub 
off all the oil with a clean piece of flannel and dry 
rotten-stone ; polish. 

TO CLEAN CARPETS. 

Have them well shaken, and when nailed down, 
sweep them clean. Take half a pail of warm water, 
half a cup of ammonia ; stir it up ; and then with a 
clean flannel cloth wrung out, wipe the carpet all 
over. Leave the window open to dry a few hours. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT. 

Take a bullock's gall in half a pail of warm water ; 
wring out a flannel cloth, and wipe the carpet all 
over. If you wish to take out grease spots after the 
carpet is shaken before nailing down, place the spot- 
across a tub, or large bowl ; have the water very hot 



292 CLEANING. 

with gall in it ; turn it on to the spot very slow ; let 
it run through until the grease is out, and then rub 
it dry with a cloth. 

CLEANING STRAW CABPETS. 

Sprinkle a little Indian meal over the carpet; 
with a flannel cloth and warm water wash the carpet 
clean, and wipe it dry. Do not use much water, 
nor wash straw carpets often, for it softens the straw. 
They do not wear as well as when wiped over with 
a damp cloth. 

CLEANING SILK. 

One cup of alcohol ; one cup of soft soap ; one cup 
of water ; half a cup of molasses ; mix this well 
together. With a flannel cloth or nice sponge wipe 
the silk over on both sides ; then with a hot iron 
press it very smooth on the side you intend to make 
the wrong side. I have only tried this on black 
silk ; it gives it a good color and stiffness.

children's table. Sll 

If an early dinner is required for adults, what is 
left from the parlor dinner, if enough, can always 
be made good (if properly done) by warming ov6r ; 
and almost all kinds of meat are nice, cut cold, if 
when put away they are put on clean dishes, — not 
all put together, and made unsightly and disagree- 
able by the carelessness of the cook. . 



CHILDREN'S TABLE. 

Where there is a family of children, it is desirable- 
they should have their meals at an equal division of 
the time of the day ; therefore, if they breakfast at * 
seven,. dine between twelve and one, and take tea 
at six, it is much better for them than late dinners. 
Children are much better if not allowed to eat at 
all times in the day. If they require anything 
between meals, let what they have be very simple, 
such as an apple, cracker, or a piece of bread and 
butter ; then they have an appetite for their dinner. 
Their digestive organs should not be kept always 
at work. If children are allowed to eat at all hours 
in the day, their stomach soon gets out of order, as 
a natural consequence. Their food should be good, 
plain, tender meats well cooked. Cooks are rather 
apt to be careless with this eaily dinner, if not made 
lo understand that it is of the utmost importance that 
children should be very well taken care of. Inter- 
est the cook for the children, and one great point is 
gained for your comfort and theirs.

DINNERS. 

Roast beef, not too much done, with dish gravy ; 
boiled potatoes ; a dish of boiled macaroni or rice ; 
a tapioca pudding. 

Fowl, boiled in about three quarts of water, a 
cup of rice, a spoonful of salt, and, if not very 
young children, an onion, two turnips, two carrots, 
boiled in the soup. This is a very nice broth, and, 
with the chickens served separately with drawn 
butter and boiled potatoes, makes a very good 
dinner. If the chickens are very old, boil them two 
hours ; if not, an hour and a half. A good baked 
bread pudding and cold sauce. 

A quarter of roast Iamb ; good potatoes, mashed ; 
green peas, well boiled ; a dish of wine curd. 

A dish of fried or boiled fish is very nice. Al- 
most all children like it. A good sago pudding. 

A small leg of mutton boiled, or roasted, with 
potatoes. Stewed tomatoes are very healthy, and 
some children like them. A dish of blanc mange. 

A broiled beefsteak, with potatoes, peas, and 
beans. A baked rice pudding. 

A veal pie is nice, if well made ; if the meat is 
well cooked, and the crust is made of raised dough, 
it will be very light. A corn-starch pudding. 

If there is not & large family of children to pro 



children's table. 313 

vide for, meats that are left from the pailor dinner 
can be served very nicely and to advantage. 

Pieces of cold roast beef laid into a pie-dish with 
a little of the gravy, a dozen tomatoes peeled and 
cut up, then another layer of beef, some nice mashed 
potatoes spread over the top about an inch thick, 
brushed over with egg, set in the oven and browned, 
make a nice, healthy dish. 

A quart of white soup stock, with some tomatoes 
stewed in, and strained to take out the seeds and 
skins ; a cup of rice boiled in this until the soup is 
absorbed ; then some pieces of any kind of tender 
meat put in and covered with rice ; cover the sauce- 
pan tight, and let it stand until the meat is hot. This 
makes a very nice dinner for children. 

Veal minced fine, and warmed with a little butter, 
is nice, if well prepared, to eat with potatoes. 

Fresh fish and potatoes, chopped fine and warmed 
with a little butter, is nice. 

Children are generally very fond of baked beans, 
but they should be very well cooked to be good. 

Any kind of tender meat warmed for a child's 
dinner should not be fried, but heated in a manner 
to keep it moist and tender. Meat or poultry, put 
into a saucepan with a little salt, very little pepper, 
a little butter, and a cup of water, and boiled up, is 
very nice. Rice, macaroni, and vermicelli, are very 
nice, boiled with the meat, for children.

814 RECEIPTS FOR A FARM-HOUSE. 



RECEIPTS FOE A FARM-HOUSE 

I give here a few receipts for a gentleman's farm- 
house, or where there are many servants employed. 

Monday. — A leg of pork boiled about four hours 
greens of any kind, cabbage-sprouts or beet-tops, 
and potatoes. A good dish of Indian mush and 
molasses. 

Tuesday. — Fried fish. A good cod or haddock, 
cut in nice-shaped pieces, and rolled in Indian meal; 
fry out some salt pork ; add some nice drippings ; 
fry the fish a light brown. Potatoes, pickles, or 
horseradish. For dessert, apple dumplings. 

Wednesday. — Boiled calf's head. Soak a calf's 
head in cold water one hour. Put it to boil, with 
two pounds of rather lean salt pork, in six quarts of 
water; let it boil three or four hours. Take a piece 
of the lights and brains ; chop them all together ; 
put into a saucepan with a quart of the liquor the 
head was boiled in, a little flour, butter, pepper, and 
salt; give it one boil; add half a cup of vinegar; 
dish the head, liver, lights, tongue, and heart, 
all together ; turn the gravy over them. Potatoes 
and parsnips. For dessert, a minute pudding. Put 
two quarts of milk to boil; when boiled, stir in 
flour until it is as thick as batter pudding ; turn it 
into a bowl that has been rinsed with cold milk, to 
prevent the pudding from adhering to it ; let it 
stand five minutes ; turn it into a dish. Served 
with sweet sauce.

nips, carrots, and potatoes, all boiled together ; then 
the vegetables are well seasoned with the meat ; 
beets must be boiled separate. For dessert, boiled 
rice and sirup. 

Tuesday. — A shin-of-beef soup, cooked the same 
day. It is very hearty with the fat on it. Break 
up the shin ; put it to boil early in the morning ; at 
ten o'clock, cut up a white cabbage, three or four 
onions, four carrots, two turnips ; put them into the 
soup, with pepper and salt ; at eleven o'clock, have 
some very light bread dough ; roll it into little balls 
and drop them in; let the soup boil till twelve 
o'clock ; when the meat comes off the bones, put it 
in a dish with the carrots and turnips round it, and 
a dish of potatoes. This is a very nice dinner for 
people that work hard. For dessert, a baked rice 
pudding. Two gills of rice, two cups of molasses, 
two table-spoonfuls of cinnamon, one spoonful of

small strips, salt and pepper, and a dozen potatoes 
peeled ; then, in a quarter of an hour, put in some

half an hour. This will be a dinner for six or eight 
men. For dessert, a dish of apples. 

Friday. — A good chowder. Fry out half a 
pound of pork and two onions ; cut up a cod and 
haddock ; peel and slice a dozen potatoes ; put into

Saturday. — Baked beans and pork; baked In 
dian pudding. 

Sunday. — Roast beef and potatoes ; a nice white 
cabbage cut very fine, roundwise, laid into ice-water

suet chopped fine, a cup of molasses, four or five 
eggs, some dried apples, or a pound of raisins j boil 
four hours. 

FOR BREAKFASTS. 

Meats left from the parlor dinners make a nice 
mince or hash, with sliced potatoes fried ; or cut 
cold, with hot baked potatoes, make a nice breakfast 
for work people. Cold bread is most economical. 

TO MAKE SWEET SAUCE. 

Two cups of sugar put to boil in half a pint of 
water ; two spoonfuls of flour into a cup of water ; 
mix it smoothly, and stir into the boiling sugar and 
water; put in a piece of butter about the size of 
an egg ; give it one boil, and add two spoonfuls of 
good vinegar and a little cinnamon or nutmeg.

818 DIRECTIONS FOB A YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER. 



DIRECTIONS FOR A YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER. 

As much of the comfort of a household depends 
upon the state of the kitchen department, I will 
endeavor to aid the young housekeeper in making 
her arrangements. 

Presuming that a range is in the kitchen, with the 
usual quantity of utensils fitted into it, it is quite 
as necessary to have other articles to be used upon 
it, such as copper saucepans, well lined, with covers, 
from three to six different sizes ; a flat-bottomed 
soup-pot ; an upright gridiron ; sheet-iron breadpans 
instead of tin ; a griddle ; a tin kitchen ; Hector's 
double boiler ; a tin coffee-pot for boiling coffee, or 
a filter — either being equally good ; a tin canister 
to keep roasted and ground coffee in ; a canister for 
tea ; a covered tin box for bread ; one likewise for 
cake, or a drawer in your store-closet, lined with 
zinc or tin; a bread-knife; a board to cut bread 
upon ; a covered jar for pieces of bread, and one 
for fine crums; a knife-tray; a spoon-tray ; -*- the 
yellow ware is much the strongest, or tin pans of 
different sizes are economical; — a stout tin pan for 
mixing bread; a large earthen bowl for beating 
cake ; a stone jug for yeast ; a stone jar for soup

oil-cloth, and suitable dishes, to induce your cook 
to have her table in good order for the . servants ; 
half a dozen rollers, one dozen dish-towels, one 
dozen towels for glasses, dish-cloths hemmed, coarse 
cloths and holders for the range. Keep a small jar 
near the sink, to be sure to save all the scraps of 
grease, and once a week boil it up and strain it into 
a firkin; and when you have obtained twenty 
pounds, you can make a barrel of soft soap ; painted 
covered pails and boxes, for all kinds of groceries, 
, in the store-closet, so that when anything is brought 
mte the house, it may be put into its proper place 
at once (for if it is put into the closet, in a paper 
bag, it seldom finds its way there) ; a large tin 
spice-box, Or small wooden ones marked for the dif- 
ferent spices ; a good painted cover for flour-barrel ; 
a large ice-chest for the cellar, for meats, butter, 
<fcc. ; a keg or half-barrel, half filled with good brine 
for salt pork ; one also for salt beef; boxes or bas- 
kets for vegetables, which one can easily move when 
sweeping. 

For the washroom, have a place for tubs, pails, 
and baskets; bags or baskets for clothes-pins and 
clothes-lines; clothes-horses, large and small; a 
dumb-betty is the best machine in use for washing ; 
an ironing blanket and sheet; a dress-board and 
bosom-board, well covered. 

When the girls have done washing, all the tubs 
and pails should be washed clean and put in their 
proper places, and the wash-room cleaned before the 
clothes are brought in for folding.

320 DIRECTIONS FOB A YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER: 

See that your store-closet and larder are filled 
with all that is necessary, and then make it a rule 
with your servants, that before any of the different 
articles should be used up, they should report to 
the mistress, as it is very inconvenient, when mak- 
ing preparations for a dinner or other meal, to wait 
until you can replenish whatever is wanted. 

When you have everything arranged, you should 
make it a rule with yourself and servants to keep 
everything clean and in its place ; and therefore it 
is best to have a fixed time to perform every duty. 
You must begin systematically yourself, if you 
expect it of others. The best time to arrange your 
household for the day is directly after breakfast. 
Consult with your cook ; provide what ie wanted 
for dinner. If you have anything left of the day 
before, that will help make it out, arrange it with 
her then. Give your orders decidedly and dis- 
tinctly ; — and now is the best time to say what you 
will have for tea and breakfast, and if anything is to 
be prepared over night for the next day's dinner, as 
this gives the cook time to make all her arrange- 
ments without haste, and leaves the mistress freo 
from annoyance the remainder of the day. The 
cook should have regular days, after washing and 
ironing are over, fol* cleaning her closets, tins, and 
larder, sweeping out her cellar, cleaning her entries 
and cellar-stairs. 

The chambermaid should have her days for wash 
ing and ironing, sweeping,-cleaning windows, silver

Ac. In this way your house will be kept in order ; 
everything will be done well and in time. 

The morning is the best time to work ; therefore 
if your servants know just what they have to do, 
and if they are faithful, they will set themselves 
about their work earlier than if they were obliged 
to wait for their orders each day ; and each servant 
should know exactly what is expected of them, and 
if left undone, the responsibility will rest with them 
alone. 

If a servant omits his or her duty, it is best to 
speak of it at once, for perhaps they can give a sat- 
isfactory excuse for not having done it; if not, 
reprove them quietly and firmly. If this method 
should be adopted when you first take a servant 
into your employ, in nine cases out of ten you will 
have a good servant in the end; but if you let 
faults pass without reproof, after a time servants 
become careless; you become impatient, change, 
and often do not improve the matter. 

Servants should be treated kindly, but with deci- 
sion. Let them feel that you have confidence in 
them, and that you are careful that every inmate of 
your household is comfortable and well taken care 
of, and that you expect them, in return, to mako 
you comfortable by doing their duty promptly and 
cheerfully. When this is understood, more interest 
will be found among servants, and they will have 
fuU credit for their faithfulness. 

Bo careful not to suspect a servant's honesty 
without a good reason for doing so ; for their cha*»

actor may be all they have to depend on. But if 
they are untruthful or dishonest, tell them so plainly 
as it may be the means of saving them from de< 
struction. Be sure that you are truthful with them. 
Be ready to give them a just character when called 
upon. It is a mistaken kindness to keep back a 
servant's real faults, and a want of candor to the 
person to whom you give their character. If they 
leave, or you send them away for some particular 
fancy of your own, do not prejudice any other person 
against them, for every one does not require tbo 
same services of a servant.

This is one of the most charming biographies ever written.

This was the great life work of the late Dr. Bethune, and 
will remain a monument of his thorough scholarship, the 
classical purity and beauty of his style, and above all, his 
deep and abiding piety. 

"When the Rev. Dr. Bethune, whose memory is yet green 
and fragrant in the Church, was about to leave this country, 
he committed his manuscripts to a few friends, giving them 
discretionary power with regard to their publication. Among 
them was the great work of his life ; in his opinion the work, 
and that from which he hoped the most usefulness while he 
lived, and after he was dead, if it should then be given to 
the press. This work was his course of lectures on the 
Catechism of the Church in which he was a burning tad 
shining light— ifcw York Obwner.

PREFACE. 



This little book is the result of twenty years' ezperienottj 
on the part of the author, in housekeeping. The receipt! 
which it contains were, in great part, originally written down 
for her own conyenienco ; others from time to time have been 
added, with the hope that they might be of service to her 
daughters. She has been led to suppose that they might be 
made useful to others also; and for this reason, with the 
advice and encouragement of those on whom she ought to rely, 
they are now published. 

Without comparing this book with any other works of a 
similar character, it is thought that it proposes the three foU 
lowing characteristics : 

1. It contains no receipt which the author has not herself 
tried and proved, experimentally, to be good. 

2. It contains a sufficient number of receipts to meet all 
the ordinary wants of a family. 

8. A third object kept constantly in view has been to pro- 
vide receipts which will enable one to furnish a table hand- 
somely, at the smallest expense. 

Great attention has been given to the last point. Few per 
sons are aware what a difference the mode ot cooking makes 
in the cost of a year's housekeeping. Without any increase 
of expenditure, one person, by means of good receipts skii- 
fbUy used, and by a tasteful arrangement of the table, will 



IV PREFACE, 

make a feast oat of the articles of food which would hay« 
hardly sufficed another for the most indifferent meal. There 
are housekeepers whose table, notwithstanding great extrava- 
gance, is always disorderly and uninviting. They do not 
know how to make use of their materials, and they never get 
beyond a coarse, uninviting abundance. There are others 
who, with the cheapest materials and with very limited means, 
through good taste, good judgment, and good cooking, have 
always a table richly and handsomely furnished. 

In this, and in other respects, the intention has been to 
prepare a work for practical use. One of the greatest con- 
veniences to a young housekeeper is a OooK Book, on the 
excellence of whose directions she may rely ; while few things 
embarrass her more than one which is filled, not with a selec- 
tion, but with an indiscriminate collection, of receipts, good, 
bad, and indifferent, brought together hap-hazard, without any 
reference to their real value. This book has at least the 
negative merit of containing nothing inserted merely to swell 
the size of the volume ; and it is believed that it may claim 
the positive merit of containing good and economical rules, 
mfficient to meet any wants which are likely to ooour in tho 
MWimoii iDond of a housekeeper's life. 



PROACE 



TO THE IMPKOVEI> EDITION. 



Eight years have elapsed since I published the 
first edition of this volume of receipts. Encour- 
aged by the very favorable reception it met with, 
and having been frequently solicited to enlarge it, 
I have added largely to the number and variety of 
the receipts, and have changed such as a longer 
experience showed to be susceptible of improve- 
ment. For the purpose of aiding young house- 
keepers, a few bills of fare have been given ; also, 
some suggestions with regard to famishing the 
kitchen, and other domestic matters. 

Trusting that this work may meet the approba- 
tion of housekeepers, I respectfully submit it to 
tiieir candid consideration.

SOUPS. 



SOUP-STOCK, ETC. 



Salt should be rubbed on to meat for making 
rtoups, and tibe meat be put into cold water/ as 
the salt and heating the meat gradually extract its 
juices. Great care should be taken to skim all kinds 
of sonp, particnlarly those made from fresh meats; 
the scum rises very thick just before the soup be- 
gins to boil ; then is the proper time to skim it. 

STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP. 

Put two knuckles or shins of veal, two onions, 
and two table-spoonfuls of salt, into eight quarts of 
water ; boil this six hours ; strain it into a stone jar ; 
keep it in a cool place ; when it is cold, take off the 
fat. The stock of white soups should be seasoned 
irith white pepper, salt, a little mace, onions, celerj 



60m>B. 11 

*nd other vegetables, not fried, as it is desirable to 
preserve the soup as white as possible. When lemon 
of wine is to be added, it should be put into the tu 
reen, and hot soup turned on to it ; for, if put into 
the soup and boiled, a great part of the flavor is lost 

BROWN STOCK. 

Take two shins of beef, one of veal, one dozen 
cloves, one dozen pepper-corns, two table-spoonfuls 
of salt, and eight quarts of water ; boil this eight 
hours ; strain it into a stone pot ; when cold, remove 
the fat. 

This is a very nice stock for brown soti ps, or to 
use instead of water in making gravy for any kind 
of dark meats, such as beef, mutton, venison, or 
any kind of wild fowl. All kinds of brown soup 
are better to have a piece of butter, a little flour, 
and onion, browned in the soup-pot, before the water 
or stock is put in. Cloves, aUspice, India soy, walnut 
catsup, in fact any kind of dark flavoring or spice, 
may be used m dressing meats and soups brown. 

If you wish brown or white soup particularly 
dear, after taking off the fat, put it to boil ; beat 
up two eggs with the shells; stir them into the 
soup ; let it boil half an hour ; take it from the fire j 
add a pint of cold water ; let it stand half an hour ; 
then strain it. This will give you a very clear soup. 
Then add vermicelli or macaroni; boil it about 
twenty minutes. 

The meat that has been boiled for soup maice^ il 



IS RBCEIFTS. 

very nice mince, when well seasoned, and warmed 
with a little of the fat taken from the stock. 

There should not be any vegetable put into soup- 
stock to keep, as it will cause the soup to turn sour. 

Onions, carrots, and celery, are good vegetables 
for all kinds of soup ; tomatoes have become a favor, 
it 9 vegetable ; the flavor is a great improvement tc 
almost all kinds of meat and fish ; therefore, if liked^ 
this vegetable can be added to any kind of dish, 
either as a vegetable or as flavoring. If soup is to 
be strained, merely cut the tomatoes up, and put 
them in with other vegetables ; if not, boil them a 
little, and strain them, before putting them into the 
soup. 

ON BOILING MEATS. 

AJl kinds of fresh meats, intended for the table, 
should be put into boiling water, thereby retaining 
the juices. If you wish to give a salt flavor to 
them, boil a piece of salt pork in the water before 
putting the meat in. A nice piece of boiled salt 
pork is a great addition to all kinds of boiled meats. 

Corned, salt, or smoked meats should be put into 
cold water to cook. Great care should be taken to 
skim the scum off well just before the water boils ; 
for if the thick scum boils into the water, it is im- 
possible to take it all ofl", and it will adhere to the 
taeats. 

Some persons, in boiling a leg of mutton for din* 
ner, add rice and vegetables to make a soup. In 
doiog this, both are spoiled; the mutton is too 



SOUPS. IS 

miicli cjoked, and has the flavor of the vegetables, 
and the soup is too fat. My plan is to boil a leg of 
mntton^ weighing ten pounds, about an hour and a 
half. [To dress it for dinner, see Boiled MuUon.] 
Set away the water the mutton is boiled in until 
next day ; then take off all the fat ; put the Uquor 
into the soup-pot with the bones of the mutton, 
a cup of rice, carrots, turnips, and onions, and 
pieces of the mutton; boil it two hours. This 
makes a nice mutton broth. If more of the mutton 
is left than is required to make soup, you can have 
a nice mince, or a mutton pie. 

Any kind of boiled meat is much better served 
in the same manner, and the water and bones used 
for soup the next day. 

If your soup is not very rich with the meat, add 
a dozen tomatoes ; they give a flavor and richness 
to soup. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

The calf's head should be soaked in cold water, and 
washed very clean. To a large head, take six quarts 
of water ; boil it four hours ; [The head may be 
dressed for dinner by directions on page 38 ;] strain 
the liquor into a stone jar, and set it away to cool 
over night, or until the fat cools ; then skim off the 
Tat ; take two quarts of the liquor, one dozen cloves, 
one dozen pepper-corns, salt, two onions, two car- 
rots, and two turnips cut fine ; boil this two hours

of the eggs, and three table-spoonfuls of soy, into

one dozen tomatoes. Boil this two hours, and 
strain it through a sieve. Toast some pieces of 
bread a light brown, cut them in dice form, and 
put them into the tureen. The soup should be 
turned on to the toast just before it is taken to the 
table, as soaking long spoils it. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

Boil a shoulder of mutton in four quarts of water 
two hours. Add one onion, two turnips, two 
carrots, cut fine, one table-spoonful of salt, and one 
cup of rice. Boil this an hour and a half; cut a

over the top ; set it on the fire ; let it boil thirty 
minutes. 

Then add a quarter of a pound of butter and 
two spoonfuls of flour, braided together ; let it boil 
A few minutes ; if you like, just before dishing, add

CHOWDEB. 

Take a cod weighing about six pounds, and a 
haddock weighing four pounds ; cut them in pieces 
about six inches square, wash them <clean, and wipe 
them dry, and dredge them with a little flour ; cut 
into slices about a quarter of a pound of salt pork 
and two onions ; fry the pork a nice brown in a 
pot large enough to make the soup in ; then take

the hot fet a layer of fish; then put in a little of 
the onion, a few bits ol pork, a little pepper and 
salt ; dredge in some flour, and, if you like the 
flavor, put in a little tomato, then another layer of 
fish, and then the seasoning, and continue this until 
the fish and seasoning are all in the pot ; split eight 
hard crackers, dip them into cold water, and lay them 
over the fish ; put in hot water enough to cover the 
fish, and affcer it begins to boil, let it boil thirty 
Bimutes. Some like half milk and half wat«r ; it

milk is ased, the tomato should be omitted; fof 
those who like spice, a little clove and mace, with a 
quart of red wine, is a great improvement. 

CUSE 1 LA cb£me. 

Bub the fish well with salt; put it into a kettle, 
with enough boiling water to cover it ; as soon as it 
boils put it on one side where it will just simmer; 
let it stand for an hour ; then take it up, and* draw 
out all the bones. Put one ounce of flour into a 
saucepan, to which add, by degrees, one quart of 
cream or new milk, mixing it very smoothly ; then 
add the juice of one lemon, one onion chopped fine, 
a bunch of parsley, a little nutmeg, salt and pepper; 
put this on the fire, stirring till it forms a thick 
sauce ; stir in a quarter of a pound of butter ;

dish ; then lay the fish on to the dish, and turn the 
sauce over it ; beat to a froth the whites of six 
eggs, and spread over the whole ; set in the oven, 
and bake half an hour. Be carefiil to bake it only 
a very light color. This is a very handsome dish 
for company ; it is very nice without the eggs, but 
not so handsome. 

BOILED COD. 

The head and shoulders is considered the best to 
boil. Lay it into cold water, with a handful of salt 
and let it remain one hour ; then scrape and wash it 
dean, rub a little salt and cayenne pepper into the 
bodYi flour a cloth, pin the fish up tight, and put it 



FISH. 29 

into boiling water ; after it begins to boil, let it boil 
thirty minutes, or according to the size of the fish ; 
serve it with drawn butter, with two or three hard 
boiled eggs chopped fine, or oyster sauce. * 

BAKED COD. 

A fish weighing six or eight pounds is a good sizb 
to bake ; it should be cooked whole to look well. 
Make a dressing of bread-crums, pepper, salt, pars- 
ley, and onion, and a little salt pork chopped fine ; 
mix this up with one egg, fill the body, sew it up, 
lay it into a large pan ; lay across it some strips of 
salt pork to fiavor it ; put one pint of water and a 
little salt into the pan ; bake it an hour and a half; 
baste it often with butter and flour ; dish the fish ; 
shake into the gravy a little fiour, a little butter, 
and two spoonfuls of tomato or walnut catsup ; give 
it one boil, and turn it over the fish. 

BROILED SCROD. 

Take a small cod, or the tail of a large one ; spriu* 
kle a little salt over it, and let it remain over night ; 
in the morning wash oS the salt, and wipe it dry ; 
set the outside to the fire first, and let it broil 
gently half an hour ; when it is dished, rub it with 
a little butter and a very little pepper ; send it to 
the table very hot. 

HADDOCK.

mace, and some small pieces of butter ; dredge in a 
little flour or cracker-crums, s^d then put in an 
other layer of fish and seasoning; cover this tight^ 
and let it simmer gently one hour ; dish it very 
carefully, and turn the gmvy over the fish. 

TO STEW HADDOCK IN ITS OWN LIQUOB. 

Take a haddock, split it open, and take the bone 
wholly out; then cut the fish into square pieoes 
about the length of your finger ; take some pounded 
mace and cayenne mixed, and put it upon the pieces 
of fish with your fingers in spots not quite an inch 
apart upon the inside; then butter the sides and 
bottom of* a large stewpan, put the fish in skin side 
down, close together, but not one upon another; 
The pan must be cold when the fish is put in ; let 
it stew slowly about an houi and a quarter ; just 
before it is quite done, mix some butter and flour 
well together, add a glass of white wine, and, when 
well mixed, turn it into the pan, and let it boil about 
ten minutes ; when ready for serving, take the fish 
out carefully in a deep dish, the spiced side up, and 
pour the gravy over it. 

FBIED GOiHaND HADDOCK.

It is quite hot, put in the fish, and fry it u light 
brown; dish it with the fried pork; serve with 
drawn butter in a sauce tureen. 

FRIED SMELTS. 

Split them just far enough to clean them; lay 
them in salt and water, and let them remain an 
hour ; then wash them clean, and wipe them dry ;

cracker-crums in another plate; put about two 
pounds of lard into the frying-pan, set it on the 
fire until it is very hot, dip the smelts into the egg 
roll them in the crums, and put them into the 
boiling fat; fry them a light brown; serve them 
hot, with drawn butter. 

FRIED PERCH. 

Skin them all but the heads ; prepare them the 
same a& smelts. They require a longer time to fry 
than smelts, being larger and thicker. 

Fresh cod's tongues, fried in the same way, are 
very nice. 

FRIED SALMON. 

Gut the salmon into slices half an inch thick, 
shake some flour over them, and fry them in butterj 
or in sweet oil, or with egg and crums, as smelts. 

FRIED HALIBUT

S2 BECEIPTS. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Salinon should be well cleansed; but not soaked 
in water; rub a little salt into the body; flour a 
cloth, and pin it up, and put it into boiling water* 
For a piece weighing six pounds, after it begins to 
boil, let it boil about half an hour. Serve it with 
drawn butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or lob- 
ster sauce. 

BBOILED SALMON. 

Lt may be either cut in slices, as fried salmon, or 
split to the tail; broil it very quick, and when it is 
dished rub some butter over it. 

BOILED HALIBUT^ 

Some like the tail best, but the next cut is nicest, 
and a much handsomer piece to dish. Bub a little 
salt over it, and lay it in cold water a little while ; 
then wash it, and scmpe it very clean ; put it into 
a floured cloth, and then into boiling water. A 
piece weighing eight pounds will require thirty- 
five minutes to cook. 

BROILED HALIBUT. 

The nape, corned, is the best piece for broiling. 
Wash it, and wipe it dry ; sprinkle a little flour over 
it ; put the outside to the fire first, and broil it mod- 
erately half an hour. When it is dished, spread a 
little butter and pepper over it.

TAUTOG, OR BLACK PISH. 

This fish is very hard to clean. Lay them in a 
pan, and pour boiling-hot water over them; then 
scrape them very hard until you get off all the 
scales; then wash and clean them in cold water. 
Let them lie in salt and water a while. Make a 
dressing of bread-crums, pepper, salt, a little clove, 
a great deal of parsley, one onion, and a little salt 
J >rk, chopped fine; mix this aU up with a little 
^ utter ; then stuff the fish, and sew it up ; put it

into an iron pan; lay some strips of salt pork ovei 
it to flavor it, dredge on a little flour, and put into 
the pan a pint of water and a pint of red wine ; 
set it into the oven of the range, and do not quite 
close the door; let it stew gently one hour and a 
half; baste it very often with the wine and butter4i 
When the fish is done, thicken the gravy with a 
little flour and butter ; give it one boil, and turn it 
over the fish. 

TO STEW TAUTOG IN CLABET. 

Gut in small pieces one onion; fry it a nice 
brown ; take out the onion ; put in the fish ; fry it 
enough to brown it in a plenty of pork fat ; take 
out the fish carefully to preserve the form; then 
thicken the gravy with flour, adding a half-pint of 
water and one pint of claret wine, a little mace,

and turn it over the fish; garnish it with slices of 
lemon, or horseradish grated. 

TO BBOIL A BLUE FISH. 

Split it in the back ; set the skin side to the fire 
first ; when done, turn the other side ; a fish weigh* 
ing three pounds requires half an hour to broil; 
when dished, rub over it a little fresh butter, and 
very little pepper and salt 

BLUE FISH, BOILED. 

A fish weighing seven pounds requires three 
quarters of an hour to boil it. Serve it with drawn 
butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or parsley ai%d 
butter. 

TUBBOT. 

We have a fiat white-fish brought to our market, 
very nearly the same as English turbot. To cook 
them, scrape them clean ; wash in salt and water ; 
wipe dry ; lay whole in a long pan ; dredge with a 
little salt and fiour; sprinkle on a little ground 
mace ; pour over it a pint of red wine and a pint of 
water ; let it stew until done. A common-sized one 
bakes in about an hour. By putting a fish-drainer 
into the pan under the fish, you can serve it with- 
out breaking. Dish it on a long, flat dish. Braid a 
Jttle fiour into a quarter of a pound of butter ; si;ir 
it into the gravy with two spoonfuls of anchovy 
Muce or walnut catsup ; give it one boil ; turn i1

pepper, salt, and butter ; fill up the shad with the 
stuffing, sew it up, and lay into a baking-pan ; lay on 
it some thin slices of pork or bits of butter ; dredge 
on a little flour ; bake about forty minutes ; when 
done, dish the shad ; then add to the gravy a piece

the gridiron; broil ten or fifteen minutes; then 
turn it skin down ; broil ten minutes ; dish it, and 
rub over it a little sweet butter ; send hot. 

EELS. 

After they are skinned, tuni boiling water ovei 
them, and let them remain about half an hoar. 
To fry them, cut them up in pieces about six mchea 
long, and fry them the same as codfish. 

BAKED EELS. 

Sprinkle some flour over them, and some pieces 
of butter ; put tibem into a pan with a little water

with some butter, flour, a Kttle water, mustard, and 
catsup. Give it one boil, and turn it on the eels. 

SALT PISH, OB DUN PISH. 

If you wish to cook a fish whole, put it into the 
fish-kettle with six or eight quarts of water at 
night ; the next morning, wash it clean out of the 
water, w|ish out the kettle, put in the fish again, 
with as much clean water as at first, and set it so 
near the fire as to scald, but not to boil. One hour 
before dinner-time, take the fish up into a pan of 
clean cold water, wash ofi* all the skin and fins, 
wash out the kettle again, and lay in the fish care- 
fully; add fresh water, and set ihe kettle on the 
fire to boil thirty minutes ; dish it in a clean nap- 
kin, on a fish-dish ; to eat with drawn butter and 
pork scraps. 

To make what are called scraps, cut a quarter of a 
pound of fat salt pork into very small square pieces ; 
put them into a fiying-pan, stirring them frequently 
until the fat is extracted, and the scraps are done 
light brown. 

If you do not wish to cook a whole fish, cut it 
into pieces about eight inches square ; when dished^ 
garnish with eggs boiled hard, and cut into slices, 
with boiled beets. Beets should always bo served 
with salt fish.

4 DISH OF GOLD OTSTEBS 

Is very nice in warm weather, to serve before 
meats instead of soup. 

A DISH OP RAW OTSTBRS. 

Wash the shells clean with a brush, and wipe dry ; 
lay on a large flat dish, with the deep side down. 
Each person at the table should be supplied with a 
coarse towel and a short knife to open the oysters. 
Some have the top shell taken off in the kitchen ; 
others have the oysters taken out of the shell and 
served in a deep dish. This, I think, is the best way ; 
but they should be left until just before serving. A 
lemon, cut in halves, should always be served with 
raw oysters. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Wash out of the hquor two quarts of oysters 
season them with pepper, a little mace, a glass of 
white wine ; add a cup of very fine cracker-crums, 
and some little bits of butter; put them into the 
pie-dish, lined with paste ; add half the liquor. The 
dish must be quite full, and covered with a rich puff 
paste ; baked until the crust is done. 

ANOTK JR OTSTER PIE. 

Line the pie-dish half way up with crust ; fill the 
dish with pieces of stale bread ; place the cover of

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Line small patty-pans with a good paste ; cut

bake the crust on tin sheets ; wash a quart of oys- 
ters out of the liquor, and put them into a sauce- 
pan ; add a piece of butter the size of an egg, half 
a teaspoonful of mace, a wineglass full of white 
wine, the juice of a lemon, and a very little flour ; 
give them one scald, stirring all the time ; fill the 
patties, put on the crust, and send to the table 
immediately, as the crusts should not get soaked 
before using them.

TO STEW A calf's HEAD. 

Boil the head, so that the large bones can be 
taken out with ease, but not enough for eating ; put 
some butter into a stewpan or baking-kettle ; when 
the butter is melted, put the jelly part of the head 
down with it, so as to brown it handsomely. Move 
it a little while cooking, lest it should stick to the 
bottom. Then turn over the head, dredge flour

BOAST VENISON. 



69 



A leg of venison weighing fourteen pounds should 
be roasted one hour if eaten on blazers ; if on hot 
plates, two hours. The dry skin should be taken off 
before roasting, with the fingers, not with a knife. 
The spit should be turned very often. When half 
done, it should be basted with flour, butter, and red 
wine, very frequently, until done. To m^ke the 
gravy, take the shank of the venison, crack the bone, 
a pound of juicy beef, an onion stuck full of cloves, 
a little pepper and salt. Put it into a saucepan with 
two quarts of water, and boil it gently three hours. 
Strain this, and add to it the drippings from the 
venison, with nearly a quarter of a pound of butter, 
braid in two table-spoonfuls of flour, a teacup of red 
wine, and a teacup of currant jelly. Stir it all up, 
and let it boil about five minutes. 

A SADDLE OP VENISON. 

A saddle of venison is much the best piece of the 
deer. It requires but half the time to roast this 
that it does the leg, for it is a much thinner piece. 
Dressed in the same md^nner as the leg. 

A VENISOIS STEAE. 

Cut steaKs from the leg half an inch thick, broil 

them about five minutes ; season with pepper, salt, 

^nd butter. If you have it, a cup of the roast veni- 

son gravy, very hot, is very nice poured over it ; or 

oalf a cup of red wine, and half a cup . of currant

jelly, thickened with a little flour aid butter, boiled 
up and turned over the steak. It should be served 
very hot. 

• VENISON PIE. 

Take the breast and neck of venison, and cut them 
into small pieces. Season with pepper, salt, and a 
little ground cloves, and dredge it well with flour ; 
put it into the pie-dish as close as possible, fill up 
the dish with some of the roast venison gravy, or 
gravy prepared in the same manner, and cover the 
dish with a nice crust. Bake it half an hour. 

BOAST PIG. * 

Make a dressing of bread-crums, a little salt, pep- 
per, sage, sweet marjoram, an onion chopped fine, 
butter, two eggs, and a little salt pork, and fry this 
a little ; when cold, stuff the pig, sew it up, and then 
wash it in salt and water ; baste it often. A pig 
weighing nine pounds requires four hours to roast 

A SPARERIB OB CHINE OP POBK 

Is much nicer if rubbed over, before it is roasted,

salt, and one egg. Dip the feet in to cover them 
Have your fat hot, and fry them until quite brown. 
Make a little drawn butter, and add a spoonful of 
vinegar to serve with them. 

pig's head cheese. 

Boil a pig's head until the bone comes out, and 
chop this very fine; pound about eight soft crackers 
very fine, and mix this up well ; add some sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt, and spices. Put this into a 
mould, and press it for two or three days. It is 
very nice cut into thin slices, and eaten cold. 

BOAST HAH. 

Spit a ham ; set it before a moderate fire to roast 
about two hours, turning the spit frequently ; then 
take it up on to a dish, peel off the rind, scrape all 
the fat out of the roaster, put it to the fire to roast 
again about two hours more ; basting it frequently 
in the same way as for beef. To make the gravy, 
put the dripping from the roaster into a saucepan, 
add a cup of water, a little flour, and give it one

A roasted ham is far superior to a boiled oua. 



72 BECEIPTS. 

BOILED HAH. 

A ham should be put into cold water enough to 
tiioro than cover it, and boiled gently. A ham 
weighing fifteen pounds requires five hours' boiling. 
When about half done, and a part of the water has 
boiled away, add, if approved, a bottle of cham- 
pagne, or a pint of good white wine vinegar ; cover 
the pot close, to keep the flavor of the wine. 

An old ham should be laid in cold water over 
night. 

BOILED LEG OF CORNED PORE. 

One weighing ten pounds should be put into cold 
water ; boiled three hours after it begins to boil.

ROAST TURKEY. 



A TURKET ihould be well singed and cleaned ot 
pin-feathers ; then draw the inwards. Be sure you 
take everything out that is inside. Lay the turkey 
into cold water ; clean the gizzards, liver, heart, and 



POULTBY. 78 

neck; let all soak one hour if you have time. Wash 
a I very clean, wipe the turkey very dry, inside and 
out. Make a dressing of two cups of bread-cnims, 
one teaspoonful of salt, two large spoonfuls of 
sweet marjoram, two spoonfuls of butter, one egg, 
and mix them well together. Cut the skin of the 
turkey in the back part of the neck, that the breast 
may look plump ; fill the breast with the forcemeat, 
and sew it up. If you have any more forcemeat 
than is required for the breast, put the remainder 
into the body, and skewer the vent ; tie the legs 
down very tight, skewer the wings down to the 
sides, and turn the neck on to the back with a 
strong skewer. Baste with salt and water once, 
then frequently with butter ; fifteen minutes before 
dishing, dredge with a little salt and fiour, and baste 
with butter for the last time. This will give a fine 
frothy appearance, and add to the flavor of the tur- 
key. 

To make the gravy, put the gizzard, neck, and 
liver, into a saucepan with a quart of water, a little 
pepper, salt, and mace ; put it on the fire, and let it 
boil to about a half pint. When done, braid up the 
liver very fine with a knife, and put it back into the 
water it has boiled in ; then add the drippings of 
the turkey and a little flour, and give it one boil, 
stirring it all the time. Dish the gizzard with the 
turkey. Allow twelve minutes to a pound for the 
time to roast a turkey.

the back, instead of the sides, as for roasting ; flour 
a cloth well ; pin up the turkey tight ; put it into 
boiling water where one or two pounds of salt pork 
have been boiling some time ; let this boil with the 
turkey. Dish the^ pork with the turkey on a sepa-

CHICKEN OB TUBKET STEWED WITH CELSBT. 

Take a yearling hen-turkey, prepare as for boiling, 
place it in a large saucepan or small soup-pot. Cut 
up a large head of celery in inch pieces, and one 
onion very fine ; put this, with white pepper, salt 
and a large teaspoonful of mace, all round the 
turkey, just cover it with hot water, and let it come 
to a boil; set it a little off the fire, and let it simmer 
two or three hours, depending on the size. Dish 
the turkey; cover it to keep hot while you are 
preparing the gravy. Braid together half a pound 
of butter and two table-spoonfuls of flour, put it 
into the saucepan with the gravy ; add a cup of 
cream, give it one boil ; turn the whole over the 
turkey. Garnish with sprigs of curled parsley. 

Chickens may be dressed in the same way. 

TO BONE AND COOK A BONED TUBKEY. 

Glean the turkey well, lay it on the table, have a 
small, sharp-pointed knife ; begin at the wing, pass 
the knife close to the bone, cut the flesh from the 
bone, and keep the skin as whole as possible ; then 
pass the knife on each side of the breast, and then 
around the legs ; split the back about half way up, 
and draw out the bones. Have ready a stuflSng 
made of the meat of a chicken chopped very fine, 
bread-crums, peppe^ salt, mace, sweet marjoram, a 
piece of butter, and two eggs, all well mixed up. 
Fill the turkey, and sew it up, preserving, the form* 
Hove two ca]^*d feet cracked up well and th# 



bones that have been taken out o£ the turkey put 
into a deep saucepan, with on^ onion and ono carrot 
cut very fine, mace, pepper, salt, and a few cloves. 
Lay the turkey on the bones, and add two quarts of 
water ; cover it tight, and let it simmer three hours ; 
then take out the turkey, flour it, baste it well 
with butter, and set it in the oven to brown. If 
there is not one quart of gravy, add more water, 
and let it boil half an hour. Beat up the whites 
and shells of two eggs, and stir into the gravy, and 
let it boil fifteen minutes ; strain it through a cloth 
into a jelly-mould. When the turkey is cold, and 
the jelly hard, disJj the turkey with the jelly on 
the breast, or cut it small, and serve round the 
turkey. 
This is considered a very nice supper dish.

PBEPABING AND COOKING SMALL BIRDS. 

Some cooks do not take out the entrails of small 
birds ; but the flavor is much nicer to draw all out, 
excepting the heart and liver. This may be done 
by making a smaU opening in the vent, and drawing 
very carefully. Wild birds should not lie in cold 
water to soak, but should be washed quickly and 
wiped dry.

downwards, with the legs down and tied together ; 
prepare the jelly as above. Pill the mould quite 
full ; set it to cool till the next day ; then turn it 
on to the dish, breast up. 

If the jelly is clear this is very handsome for a

colored jelly cut fine and sprinkled round the dish, 
with a little curled parsley.

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

The coffee should be dried in the oven with the 
djor open one or two hours before roasting. When 
it is ready to roast, set it on the fire in an iron pan, 
and stir it constantly until it becomes a light brown« 
To two pounds of coffee add a bit of butter about 
the size of a walnut three minutes before taking it 
from the fire. Coffee is much better when it is 
roasted, ground, and made witJiin one hour. One 
cup of ground coffee will make one quart of coffee. 
To make coffee in a biggiu put the ground coffee 
into the filter, wet it with co\d water, and let it stand 
five minutes to swell. Put the filter into the pot 
where it belongs ; fill it up with boiling water, and 
set where it will keep hot, but not boil. When this 
has run through, add water until you have made a 
quart of coffee. It does not require more than ten 
minutes to make good coffee. 

To boil coffee, put into a coffee-pot one cup oi 
ground coffee, and stir in one egg, or a piece of salt 
fish-skin two inches square ; add one quart of water. 
Boil it ten minutes, take it off, turn a cupful out at 
the spout, and back again into the pot. Let it stand 
ten minutes. Turn it off into another pot to send 
to table. Boiled cream or milk should always b6 
nerved with coffee.

then roll it' out thin again ; roll out the other cake 
of butter, lay it on the paste, dredge on a little more 
flour, and roll it up again. Cut it into as many 
pieces as required. For edging, roll out a piece as 
long as will go around the plate without piecing, as 
it looks much better. The edging should be three 
or four layers of paste rolled very thin, and put on 
the rim of the plate. Use sifted flour to dredge on 
the paste-board, and to roll the butter and paste 
together. This flour is included in the weight of 
the flour for the paste. 

COMMON PASTE. 

Take one pound of flour, and three quarters oi a 
pound of butter ; sift the flour on the paste-board ;

to stick the flour and butter together, and roll it 
or.t about an inch thick ; put the rest of the butter 
on the paste ; dredge on some flour, roll up the

whites of two eggs, and strajn it as before stated* 
This maybe put into moulds hot, or in glasses when 
it is cold. 

In the winter, when calves' feet are very costly, 
use the shins of veal. Two shins, well soaked in 
cold water two or three hours, will make the same 
quantity as above. When this is done, it wilt make 
two quarts of jelly. 

Pigs' feet, well cleansed, make quite as handsome 
a jelly as calves' feet, and it looks more glassy. Four 
feet will make at least three pints when it is done»

DIBECTIONS FOB FREEZING ICE CREAKS, WATER 

ICES, ETC. 

Break the ice in small pieces, — say about the 
size of an egg, or smaller, — and put some in the 
bottom of a tub ; set the kettle in ; then put in 
about a quart of coarse rock salt ; then two quarts 
of ice ; and so on until the tub is filled up to the 
top of the kettle. Stir it until the cream is frozen. 
In the old-fashioned freezer you must take off the 
cover frequently, and scrape off the cream from the 
sides until it freezes evenly. 

If it is to be put into moulds, fill them quite full, 
shut them very tight, and put them in the ice and 
salt, covering them entirely ; then throw over a 
piece of carpet to keep the air out. To take them 
out of the mould, have your dish ready, wipe the 
mould, and then turn over it some boiling water, 
wiping it again very quickly ; then turn it on the 
dish. Remove the mould very slowly, for fear of 
breaking. When pure essences can be procured, 
they are quite equal to fresh fruits to flavor with.

be obtained ^t Messrs. Smith & Melvin's, at 325

ibove-named articles expressly for retailingi and

put it into bottles, cork and seal them. This make? 
a very nice drink with ice-water. 

CUBBANT JELLY. 

The currants should b6 ripe, and fresh-picked. 
Put them into a preserving-kettle with a very little 
water, say about a cupful, to prevent them from 
burning. Let them stew gently until the currants 
turn white, then strain them through a sieve ; they 
will not require much squeezing. Take a pint of 
juice to a pound of sugar, put them into the kettle^ 
and boil it thirty minutes. Take a spoonful out on 
a plate, and set the plate on ice; if it is done, it will 
stiffen in five minutes. Then strain it through a

PRESEBYED CITRON MELON. 

Peel the melon, take out the inside, and cut it in 
such pieces as you like — thin strips, about a quarter 
of an inch thick, I think are the best. Then weigh 
the melon, and take the same weight in fine white 
sugar ; put a little alum iu some water, and boil the 
melon in it until it is tender ; take it up on a dish, 
sprinkle the sugar over it, and between the pieces, 
and let it stand over night. Then turn off the 
sirup into the preserving-kettle, and boil until 
clarified ; then put the melon in, and boil it until 
scalded through; take it out on a dish to cool. 
Add to the sirup two lemons and a little preserved 
ginger, to flavor it ; boil the sirup again, until quite 
clear; put the melon up into jars, turn the sirup over 
it, not quite boiling hot ; when cold, seal up your 
jars as for other preserves. 

PINEAPPLE. 

Peel the pineapple, and cut it in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; take a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit; sprinkle the sugar over the apple, 
and let it stand until the next day. Then put it 
into the kettle, and boil it until the apple looks dear.

PBESEBYES. l&l 

Take out the apple to cool ; give the sirup one boil; 
and then strain it through a hair sieve on the fruit. 

PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Peel the apple and weigh it — a pound to a pound 
of sugar ; grate the apple on a coarse grater ; put 
the apple and sugar in the kettle together, and let 
it boil thirty or forty minutes. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Weign one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; 
put the sugar into the kettle with just water enough 
to prevent its burning ; boil to a sirup ; then put in 
as many strawberries at a time as will cover the top 
of the sirup without crowding them, and let them 
boil twenty minutes. Take them out carefully, so 
as not to break them, and put them in a dish to cool 
separately. When cold, put them into glass jars, 
and strain the hot sirup through a hair sieve on to 
them. 

The Hovey Seedlings are the bent to preserve in 
this manner, as they are very large. If, however, 
they get broken, it would be better to pnt them 
back into the kettle, and boil t)iem thirty minutes 
for jam. 

ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh a pound of fine loaf sugar to a pound of 
fruit; sprinkle the sugar over the fruit, and let it 
stand over night. The next day, Qti^ain ofif the sirup

with paper dipped in brandy, and a bladder over it. 

CODDLED APPLES. 

Peel the apples, leaving the stems on, and pat as 
many as will stand into the preserving-kettle or 
saucepan ; put in a little water, and let them boil 
until they are tender ; take them out carefully ; 
allow a cup of sugar to three apples ; put it into the 
water that they were boiled in, and boil it ten min- 
utes. Peel a lemon very thin, in very narrow strips; 
lay them around the stem of the apple ; put them 
into the sirup, and boil them until they are clear. 
Put them into the dish in which you send them to 
the tablo, and pour the sirup on them. These will 
not keep more than three or four days. 

PEABS. 

Peel the pears, boil them in water until they 
are quite tender, and then take them out on a dish 
to cool. Make a sirup of white sugar. A few 
pieces of ginger and a slice of lemon make a nice 
flavor to the sirup. Put in the pears, and boil them 
gently until they are quite clear ; the time depends 
on the size ; if they are small they require abou! 
thirty minutes. If to keep all winter, allow a pound 
Af sugar to a pound of fruit.

BEEF JUICE FOB THE SICK. 

Cut one pound of beef into small pieces, put it 
into a bottle and cork it up ; set the bottle into a 
kettle of cold water ; let it stand over the fire until 
the water boils, and longer if the juice is not all out 
of the beef. This is for invalids who can take but 
little liquid at a time, therefore cannot take beef tea. 

ANOTHER BEEF JUICE. 

Take about a pound of rump of beef; lay it on the 
gridiron ; let it just warm through ; sprinkle a little 
salt over it ; cut it in pieces about the size of half a

INTRODUCTION. 



It is about nine years since I published my last 
book of Receipts for Cooking. Since that time, I 
have been constantly engaged in providing for a 
large, and sometimes for a small, family ; therefore 
I have had opportunity to improve, as practice 
makes perfect in every profession. 

I do not presume to say that I have perfected my 
knowledge ; but nine years have given me so much 
more experience, that I am induced to make addi< 
tions to my book of many receipts that I think will 
be very useful ; and as provisions of all kinds are so 
expensive, all housekeepers are glad to receive any 
suggestions of economy. 

If a lady is convinced that she can, by her own 
attention to her housekeeping, make her expenses 
much less and home more comfortable, I think she 
would take as much pride in her well-ordered house- 
hold, and well-cooked dishes, as her great-grand- 
mother did of old. It is not necessary that a lady 
should give up any of her real accomplishments, as 
an educated, refined lady, to attend to her house- 
keeping, for the first requisite is econqmy of time as 
well as money ; every hour of her day may be spent 

17 * (1»7)

198 INTRODUCTION. 

with profit to herself and to others, thereby receiv- 
iug much, and giving much, pleasure. 

When a young lady allows herself to be placed at 
the head of her husband's establishment, she is ex* 
pected to preside with dignity and propriety. Is it 
not necessary that she should be capable of directing 
understandingly her household ? To be able to di- 
rect well is necessary, if she expects her- orders well 
executed. 

Young people have the idea that they do not wish 
to be troubled with their cooking, therefore they do 
not care to know much about the matter. This is a 
mistaken notion. It is not necessary that a'^lady, to 
have her cooking well done, must wit];i her own 
hands do it. 

I provide, and have a large dinner to attend to, 
every day, but I do not cook it. If I was obliged to 
do so, I should think myself a poor director of my 
business. But it is absolutely necessary that I 
ahould know how everything in my house is to be 
done, from the cleaning of a knife to the best cooked 
dinner I have served. 

If I should be so situated that I felt it necessary, I 
fioxild go into my kitchen and cook a dinner ; and I 
think that we should have better cooks, and be bet- 
ter served, if every lady knew enough of housekeep- 
ing duty to be thus far independent. 

We all know that much of the happiness of a 
family depends on good food, well cooked, and well 
served. Here is another necessity for economy of 



J

(imo — punctuality. If your timo is set for youi 
meals, you expect your cook to be punctual, and to 
serve her meals hot. That you cannot have, unless 
you are ready yourself to receive them — for if they 
must be kept hot by standing in the oven or on hot 
plates, the dinner will be spoiled — you waste your 
own time, and your servant's too. 

Negligence is very easily learned if you are not 
punctual. Your servants soon learn to think, 
" Well, mistress will not be ready; therefore it is no 
great matter if I am a little late." A half hour late 
hero and there soon absorbs our time, which is 
valuable, and whose is not ? 

It is under these impressions that I have set my- 
self to the work of helping the young housekeeper to 
please herself and husband, by her ready use of the 
advice tliat I have, or can give her.

ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 

These receipts I give for a small family, for it is 
almost impossible to cook little enough for two with- 
out waste, and I think most people like made dishes 
if well made, and that cannot bo without^ the atten- 
tion of mistress and cook, for made dishes require 
more judgment and attention than a fresh cooked 
joint of meat, although I think all cooking requires 
care. 

A very common fault is, that there is not at- 
tention enough paid to this branch of housekeeping. 
In almost all families the cook is required to take 
a part, and often a large part, of the washing and 
ironing ; therefore she will either not do this well, 
or neglect the cooking. A cook who likes her busi- 
ness, and consequently does it well, does not like 
washing and ironing; therefore, if a cook must 
wash, it is best to have a simple dinner on that day, 
and a cold dessert, giving as little cooking as possi- 
ble, if you want both done well. 

BOUILLI BEEF. 

A piece of the round, or shoulder of mutton piece, 
or a part of the face of the rump, makes a very nice 
bouilli. 

Take eight or ten pounds of beef ; put it to boil 
tsix or eight hours in six quarts of water, with two 



1 



202 ECONOMICAL BECEIPTS. 

onions, two carrots, one dozen cloves, salt, and pe]> 
per. Take up the beef ; set it away until the next 
day ; strain the liquor into the soup-jar ; the next 
day set on tlie fire a saucepan that will about hold 
the beef; cut two onions fine, fry them in a little 
butter, dredge in some flour to brown, lay in the 
beef; liave ready two carrots, two turnips, two 
onions, a little celery, one leek, all cut in small dice 
form; lay them round the beef; then add enough 
of the stock it was boiled in to just cover it. Let it 
cook slowly two hours and a half. Dish the meat ; 
add to the gravy one table-spoonful of mixed mustard, 
one of soy, and a little flour if it has not consistency 
enough ; give it one boil ; turn over the meat the 
vegetables and gravy ; chop fine two pickled cucum- 
bers, and sprinkle them over the top of the meat. 
The water the beef was boiled in may be served as a 
clear beef soup. 
What is left of the bouilli makes a nice 

BEEF PIE. 

Gut the beef in slices ; cut in very thin slices ono 
onion ; lay this in the bottom of the pie-dish ; then a 
layer of beef; dredge in a little flour ; then a layer 
df beef, and onion, pepper, salt, and flour, and beef, 
until the dish is full : then add the cold gravy ; if 
not enough, a little stock or water ; scald and peel 
as many tomatoes as will cover the dish ; lay them 
on, pepper, salt, and bread crumbs, a few bits of but- 
ter ; set it into the oven to brown. By the time the 



EOONOMICAL BBCEIPTS. 208 

lomatocs are cooked, the meat is hot. This is a 
very nice dish. 

MUTTON PIE. 

If you have a leg of mutton boiled ^for dinner, set 
the water away until the next morning ; and also 
the dish that the mutton was served in, just as it 
comes from the table. 

Cut all the mutton from the bone that you will 
use for broth ; cut the mutton in not very thin 
pieces ; cut up an onion ; chop a little parsley. Lay 
into a pie-dish a layer of meat seasoned with a little 
onion (if you like, the onion may be omitted), a little 
parsley, pepper, and salt, and a little of the cold 
drawn butter and dish gravy that was left ; another 
layer of meat and seasoning as before, and so on 
until the dish is nearly full. "Have tomatoes enough 
peeled to cover the dish ; sprinkle over some pepper 
and salt; cover all with bread crumbs, and a few 
little bits of butter. Set it into the oven. By the 
time the tomatoes are warm, the mutton is hot. 
This dish saves your cold mutton, and is very nice. 

MUTTON BBOTH. 

Sot away the water that the mutton was boiled in, 
in a stone jar, or some kind of earthen dish ; the 
next day take off all the fat ; put the broth into tlie 
soup pot, with the bones of the mutton cradsed up, 
two onions, two carrots, two turnips, cut small ; let 
it boil one or two hours ; with a skimmer take out 



1 



204 ECONOMICAL RECEIFTS. 

the bones ; add half of a large cup of rice ; some 
salt. Let it boil one hour, and you will have a verj 
good mutton broth. 

BEEF PIE. 

Gold roast beef (from the bone to be used foi 
soup), cut in not very thin pieces; slice an onion, 
fry it in a little beef drippings ; add a little flour to 
brown; lay this into a pie-dish ; then the beef; 
season with pepper and salt ; a few slices of toma- 
lO, if you like ; all the beef juice that was left in 
the dish ; as much of the gravy as will nearly fill the 
dish ; add a little water, or beef stock if you have it 
Boil eight or ten potatoes; mash them fine ; add a 
little salt, half a cup of cream or butter ; stir this up 
light ; spread it over the pie-dish an inch and a half 
thick ; brush it over with a paste brush dipped in a 
beaten egg. Set it into the oven for half an hour 
to brown. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

The water chicken was boiled in, set away in a 
cool place, makes a good broth. The next day skim 
off the fat ; take the bones of the chicken ; put into 
the soup-pot with the broth, one onion cut very fine, 
one carrot, one turnip, a small bunch of parsley, a 
little salt, and pepper ; let boil two hours ; with a 
sldmmer take out the bones; add a half cup of 
vermicelli ; let boil one hour ; you will have a nice 
chicken broth. 

Take off all the meat you can from the bones« To

ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 20fi 

make anj of these little dishes requires but very lit- 
tle meat. 

CfflCKEN PATES. 

Cold chicken chopped fine makes a nice chicken 
Balad J- but if you have not enough for that, season 
the chicken with a very little mace, pepper, salt, 
half a cup of cream ; put it into a saucepan ; let it 
get hot. Have ready a nice paste ; line a few patty- 
pans with it, and bake them ; then fill them with tlie 
hot chicken. Slip them out of the pans on to a 
small dish. Half a dozen p^tds make a pretty dish 
All these little things saved help a dinner. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Made of cold roast, or boiled chicken. Skin the 
chicken ; cut it in nice pieces ; lay these in a pie- 
dish ; if you have any of the cold gravy put that in, 
if not, put the chicken bones into a saucepan with 
as much water as you want of gravy ; season with 
pepper, salt, and a very little mace ; boil this until 
all the strength is out of the bones ; put it into the 
dish ; cover it with a. good paste. Bake it about 
half an hour. 

FRICASSEE OF GOLD CHICKEN. 

Skin the breast of the chicken ; cut the rest in 
nice pieces ; lay the breast into the saucepan, with 
the other pieces round it ; dredge in a little flour, 
pepper, salt, mace ; a piece of butter the size of an 

18 



206 BOONOMICAL RBCEIPTB. 

3gg, braided with a spoonful of flour, half pint of 
cream or good milk, and half a gill of white stock 
or water ; let it simmer about twenty minutes. 
Dish the breast in the middle, place the other pieces 
round it, and turn on the gravy. 

VEAL. 

I have it from one of our first physicians, that this 
is not unwholesome when well cooked. This meat 
can be made into many little side dishes. A leg of 
veal makes a part of four dinners. The shin a soup, 
the next cut a fillet, two slices cut from the round a 
cutlet. The meat that you can take off the shin 
that is boiled for soup, will make as nice a salad as 
chicken, for it is boiled very tender. Chop it very 
fine, and dress it the same as chicken, and many 
would scarcely know the difference. What is left 
of the fillet makes nice croquettes. Or chop it very 
fine, put it into a frying-pan with the cold gravy, and 
let it get very hot, but not fry ; serve it on toast, or 
with toast cut in three-cornered pieces, and set up 
round the dish. If you have no gravy, add a piece 
of butter, pepper, salt, and a very little hot water ; 
Btir it well ; be sure not to let it fry, for that would 
Bpoil it. 

COLD LOIN OP VEAL. 

Cold loin of veal makes the best mince, because it 
has more fat, and is, consequently, less dry than the 
leg. A little of the mince veal makes nice p&t^s as 
chicken in paste. 



ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 207 

ANOTHER VEAL CROQUETTE. 

Chop the veal very fine ; add half as much bread 
crumbs as veal ; season with mace, pepper, and salt ; 
add one raw egg; roll thin in pieces about three 
inches long ; dip them in egg and crumbs ; fry in 
hot fat. Served in a small flat dish, dressed with 
parsley. 

STEWED BREAST OP VEAL. 

Lay a nice breast of veal in a baking-pan ; turn 
over it one quart of water ; set it into the oven to 
stew about two hours ; then baste it with butter, and 
brown it. Make the gravy with what remains of the 
water it was stewed in ; dredge in a little flour, pep- 
per, salt, a small piece of butter ; give it one boil ; 
send to the table in a gravy-dish. 

VEAL POT-PIE. 

Take a scrag and knuckle of veal ; fry a few slices 
of pork in the soup-pot ; cut the veal and knuckle in 
small pieces, and put it into the pot ; add pepper 
and salt ; just cover the meat with cold water ; let 
it boil two or three hours ; add six or eight small 
potatoes ; it not seasoned enough, add more pepper 
or salt. Have a nice raised dough ; roll it about 
half an inch thick ; cut it in pieces, and cover the 
meat. Cover the pot tight, and let it stew half an 
hour. When dishing, lay the crust round the dish ; 
put the meat and potatoes in the middle. This is a 
very homely dish, but good and cheap. 



208 ECONOMICAL RECEIPTS. 

STUFFED LOAF, 

Mince what is left of a leg of veal ; mix with it 
pepper, salt, a little mace, and a little onion if pro- 
ferred. Take a stale baker's loaf (an outside one is 
preferable, as it has more crust) ; cut a hole about 
three inches square in the bottom of it, and scoop 
out all the soft (this can be saved for a bread-pud- 
ding) ; then, after heating the mince in the spider, 
fill tlie loaf with it ; replace the square piece of crust 
and tie it up ; then put the loaf into the spider in 
hot fat, and turn it over until the whole is a dark 
brown. Garnish the dish, and it will be a very at- 
tractive looking ornament for a table. 

VEAL LOAF. 

Three pounds uncooked veal ; half pound salt 
pork chopped fine ; three eggs ; three teaspoonfals 
of salt, two of pepper ; a handful of cut parsley, 
sweet herbs ; one cup of cracker-crumbs. Bake one 
hour and a half. Basting with butter. Cut in 
slices when cold. 

A SHIN OF aEEF. 

To make a very nice dish to cut cold for lunch, 
tea, or breakfast, with baked potatoes. . Put a snin 
of beef to boil in eight quarts of water, with a table- 
spoonful of salt ; just before it comes to a boil skim 
it well ; let it boil all day ; if the water boils away, 
add more, but not too much — just enough to keep 



i 



ECONOMICAL BECEIFTS. 209 

it from burning. When the meat is boiled to 
Bhreds, turn it out into a pan, that you may take 
out every little bit of bone ; put it back into the pot ; 
season it well with pepper, salt, cloves, allspice, and 
a little sweet herbs if you like ; let it simmer half 
an hour ; stir it up well ;-turn it into a deep dish ; 
set it away. When it is cold it will be as hard aa 
cheese. Cut it in thin slices ; garnish the dish with 
parsley. This will keep on the ice iii summer a 
week, and in winter a month. It is very nourishing, 
as it has all the substance of a shin of beef that 
would be used for two or three days for soup. 

COLLALU. 

Half a peck of tomatoes ; quarter of a peck of 
ochra ; peel them, and put them on to stew with a 
slice of ham ; stew them an hour ; then add two 
pounds of hashed meat, and two onions ; season it 
highly with pepper and salt, and let it remain on 
the fire three or four hours. 

AN ENGUSH BOUND OF BEEF. 

Take the top part of a fine fat round of beef, 
weighing about fifteen pounds ; corn it for three or 
four days ; take it out of the pickle ; do not wash 
off all of the salt ; tie it round strong, to keep it in 
a perfect round shape when cooked ; put it to boil 
with not much more water than will cover it ; boil 
with it four carrots and six turnips ; let them boil 
podt^ratftly four hours. Serve with it the carrots 

18* 



210 BBBAD-MAKINO AND BAKU^O. 

cut lengthwise. Mash the turnips with a little salt 
and butter, a cabbage or cauliflower, and beets. For 
gravy, take three gills of good drawn butter, add one 
large table-spoonful of mixed mustard, ono of soy, 
one of vinegar, or the juice of a lemon, or plaiu 
drawn butter, as you may choose. This is nice cold, 
sliced thin. 



ON BREAD-MAKING AND BAKING. 

As bread is one of the most essential articles of 
food, it is of great importance to have good bread, 
well baked, as a matter of health and economy aa 
well as pleasure. We cannot expect all this wUh- 
oat care and attention. One must have^ood yeast, 
good flour, and willing, clean, strong hands. 

YEAST. 

This is the first requisite for good bread. You 
can buy yeast at the baker's or brewer's, but home- 
made is better than either. 

Take as many dry hops as you can grasp in your 
hand ; put them into a saucepan ; turn on two 
quarts of boiling water; set them on to boil. In 
another saucepan put eight or ten potatoes to boil ; 
when the potatoes are done, the hops will be boiled 
enough. Mash the potatoes fine ; add two table- 
spoonfuls of salt; strain tlio hop-water on to the 



BBBAD-MAKING JlSI> BAKINQ. 211 

potatoes ; stir in as much flour as will make a thio 
batter ; let it stand to cool ; whea cool enough to 
put your hand in, stir in one pint of good yeast, 
either baker's or brewers ; set it to rise five or sii 
hours, or until it is all of a foam ; then strain it 
through a cullender into a stone jug ; stop it tight ; 
keep it in a cool place. This will keep a week. It 
is best to make yeast while you have enough to rise 
a new jug full. 

MAKING DRY YEAST. 

In the country people are frequently troubled to 
get yeast to start with. This is a reliable receipt : 

Take one pound of good dry hops,; put them in a 
pailful of water ; let it boil one hour. Boil one peck 
of good potatoes ; mash them fine ; strain the water 
from the hops on to them ; add one teacup of salt ; 
stir in flour enough to make a thin batter ; let it 
stand to get cool. When cool enough to put your 
hand in, stir in one quart of good fresh yeast ; set it 
to rise six or eight hours ; when it is all of a froth, 
have ready very nice-sifted corn meal ; stir this in 
until it is thick enough to roll out ; roll this about 
a quarter of an inch thick ; cut it into squares about 
four inches. Lay a sheet down wiiere the sun is very 
bright ; spread the cakes on it to dry ; turn them 
twice a day until perfectly dry, then pack them away. 
It takes two or three days to make a batch of dry 
yeast. When wanted for use, take a cake, put to it 
half a pint of lukewarm water, a table-spoonful of 



212 BBBAI^HAEINQ AND BAKOra.' 

sugar, a teaspoonful of salt ; stir in flour enough to 
make a thin batter ; set it in a varm place until it 
rises. This will rise four quarts of flour. Mix tha 
same as the other yeast bread. 

FOB HAEINO LOAF BBEAD. 

Sift the flour into a large drj pan ; always siA 
flour before using it, it is much lighter. It is best 
to have it ready before beginning any other prepara 
tions. Put into a tin pan, or woodea one, two 
quarts of warm water, tiol hot; stir in about a quart 
~-of £our ; stir this up with your hands ; add one cup 
of yeast, one table-spoonful of salt ; keep stirring or 
beating up the mixture ; add more flour, working it 
witli both hands, until you get enough to make a 
smooth light dough. Cover it with a clean cloth ; 
set it to rise in a warm place over sight. In the 
morning flour tlio bread-board, turn the dough on to 
it, and knead it well with both hands ; cut it into 
two or tliree loaves, and knead each one. Kub the 
bread-pans with a little butter ; put in the bread, 
and let it stand to rise thirty or forty minutes, or 
till you see it iias risen ; put it into the oven to bako 
three quarters of an hour. When you take it out 
of the oven turn the loaf over, and strike it with 
your knuckles ; if it makes a ringing sound, tlie 
bread is baked, if not, let it bako ten or fifteen 
minutes longer. If the crust Geems to have baked 
too hard, take a clean towel, wring it out of cold 
water, roll the bread in it, and let it remain about 



BBEAD-MAEING AND BAKING. 213 

fifteen minutes. It will cut better when the bread 
is oold. 

A little Indian meal in white loaf bread is very 
nice for a variety. Sift and scald, with boiling 
water, a quart of meal ; let it stand until cool ; mix 
this in with the flour. The bread requires a little 
more salt, and a little more baking, than when made 
all flour. 

I use butter to rub on my bread-pans, as any other 
fat might leave an unpleasant taste on the crust. A 
small piece of butter warmed in a saucer, and put 
on to the pans with a clean piece of cloth, is the best 
for buttering pans for baking bread and cake. 

BBEAEFAST AND DINNER BOLLS. 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg ; put it 
into a pitcher, and turn on a pint of boiling water ; 
stir it until the butter is melted ; then add one pint 
of cold. milk. Turn this into the bread-pan ; add 
three pints«of flour ; stir it up ; then half a cup of 
good yeast, half a cup of white sugar, one spoonful 
of salt ; stir this briskly ; keep adding flour, and 
beating it, till it is of good consistency, neither too 
hard nor too soft, but smooth and light to the hands. 
* Cover it with a cloth (in winter put a piece of 
woollen cloth over the bread-cloth to keep it warm, 
that it may rise well). In the morning turn the 
dough on to the bread-board ; knead it well with 
both hands, and roll it out about an inch thick ; cut 
it in equal bits as large as you wish the rolls. Take 



1 



214 BREAD-MAKINO AND BASHTG. 

the bits between your hands, and roll them in long 
rolls of about six inches and two wide; have the 
bread-pans rubbed with a little butter ; lay the rolls 
in, in even length and shape ; let them rise an hour, 
and bake twenty minutes. When you take the 
rolls from the oven — before you take them from 
the pan, and while they are hot — brush them over 
with a little butter. This adds very much to the 
appearance, making the rolls look smooth and glossy. 
These long rolls are nice for breakfast. For dinner 
make them shorter, about four inches in length, but 
the same width, or roll out the dough, and cut it 
witli a common-sized biscuit-cutter ; baked the same 
as the rolls.

CHAPTER ON SOUP-MAKING. 

Always rub salt into the meat for soup stock ; 
put it into cold water to boil ; just before it comes 
to a boil skim it well, for if allowed to boil before 
that thick scum is taken off, it will boil into the 
soup, and cannot be taken out at all. Spice, pepper, 
and salt may be put into the pot after it is well 
skimmed ; but never put in vegetables when boiling 
stock, for that would cause it to turn sour. After 
soup stock has boiled enough to extract all the juice 
of the meat, and becomes a jelly, it spoils it to boil 
more. So that if you have a good soup stock of 
meat, all that you have to do is to boil your vegeta- 
bles, that you wish to season with, in just water 
enough to cover them ; let them boil enough to ex- 
tract all the flavor. If you put the soup to boil, and 
tlie vegetables in it, by the time the flavor is ex- 
tracted nearly half the soup will be boiled away. 

Put a piece of butter in the bottom of the soup- 
pot, with one or more onions sliced, according to the 
iquantity of soup to be made, allowing one good-sized 
ouion to every quart of soup ; fry the onion a nice 
brown ; dredge in a little flour to brown ; strain the 
water from the vegetables through a cullender into 
the pot ; add as much of meat stock as you wisJi to 
have soup; stir this up, and boil it about fifteen 
minutes. If you wish to flavor with wine, put it 



80nP-MAKIN0. 219 

into the tureen, and pour the hot soup on to it, fot 
if you put it to boil with the soup the flavor is lost. 
It is the same with catsup or soy, or any seasoning 
of that kind. 

Bread-crumbs, too, should be put into the tureen, 
as they will become too soft if boiled. 

TO MAKE A SOUP STOCK. 

What I call brown stock, is made of beef shins and 
a piece of coarse beef. White stock is made of veal 
shins, and an old fowl if you choose. 

One hind shin of veal will make three quarts of 
t^ood veal stock ; one hind shin of beef will make 
five quarts of good beef stock ; one beef shin and one 
veal shin together will make eight quarts. The 
veal and beef together make tlie best soup. You 
can buy half of each, if you do not want as much as 
the whole will make. Wash the shins clean, but do 
not soak them; rub over them a little salt; put 
them into an iron pot, and put in twice as much 
water as you expect to have soup. It must be set 
on the fire to come to a boil ; do not forget to skim 
it before it comes to a boil ; then set it back on the 
range, where it will boil gently all day. Keep it 
covered, so that it shall not boil away too fast ; if it 
does boil away too much, add more water, so as to 
keep about the quantity desired. If you require the 
soup to be more meaty or richer, add to the shins a 
good piece of coarse juicy meat, either beef or veal ; 
what in called a sboulder-of-mutton piece of beef u 



::20 

very jaicy, and about six pounds wiih the shins will 
make the soup much richer, but the shin is tlie most 
nr.tritious in soups. 

All kinds of bones of roast or boiled meat or 
' poultry, if boiled long enough, make good soup 
stock. They should be boiled all day to extract the 
substance of the bones as well as the meat, then 
strained into a stone jar or earthen pot, never iu tin, 
to stand in a cool place until the fat cools, then take 
that off. If this process is observed, you can always 
have a good soup, because you have a good stock to 
begin with ; you can flavor it as you please. 

I have given many receipts for soup, but these re- 
marks ar^for standard directions. 

ON SOUP-MAKING. 

It is necessary to have a flat-bottomed pot to set 
on, not into, the range, for fear of scorching, as a 
soup is spoiled if it has the slightest taste of being 
burned. It is best to boil the bones in such a pot, 
as they must boil all the time slowly, and a flat- 
bottomed pot can be set back on the range. 

TO DRESS A GBEEN TURTLE FOB S0T7P. 

Gut off the head, and hang it with the body to 
bleed. When the bleeding has stopped, place the 
turtle on its back ; with a strong sharp knife separate 
the back from the under shell ; take off the fins ; cut 
up the under shell, and put it into a pan with the 
6ns ; turn boiling water over them ; let them stand 



Ken minutes. Take them out; then with jour 
fingers and a small knife peel off all the tough skin ; 
throw them into salt and water ; take the inwards, 
separate the liver, lights, heart, and sweet-breads 
from the gall ; wash the entrails and inwards very 
clean ; put them into another pan of salt and water 
to soak ; clean the meat and green fat from the top 
shell ; put them all into water, and let them soak 
over night, 

TO MAKE THB SOUP. 

Wash all the turtle ; put it into clear fre^n water 
to soak for an hour ; leave the liver, lights and 
sweet-breads, heart and green fat, soaking ; the rest 
of the turtle and a calFs head put into about five 
gallons of water, to boil gently all day (do not use 
the haslet with the calfs head) ; tie the liver, lights, 
sweet-bread, and heart, in a cloth ; put them into a 
pot to boil three hours; take them out to cool to 
make force-meat balls ; strain the soup through a 
coarse cullender ; set it away with the meat in a cool 
place till the next morning. Put about half a pound 
of butter into a large soup-pot, with four largo onions 
cut fine ; fry to a nice brown ; take the pot off the 
fire ; add one table-spoonful of ground cloves, one of 
allspice, one of mace, two of grated nutmeg, one of 
pepper, two of salt, two of sweet marjoram, two of 
summer savory, two of chopped parsley ; stir this 
together, then add the soup ; set it to boil ; take 
out with your fingers all the little bones from the 

19 • 



222 80UP-MAKINQ. 

meat ; put all into the soup, adding the green fat ; 
let all bpil about four hours. While the soup is 
boiling, chop up very fine the liver, lights, and 
sweet-bread and heart; add one teacup of bread* 
crumbs, the yolks of four eggs, one teaspoonful 
of ground cloves, one of mace, one of thyme, 
one of sweet marjoram, one of summer savory, 
one of pepper, and two of salt ; drop in two 
raw eggs and half a pound of butter ; mix this all 
up with the hands ; make it into balls the size of 
robins' eggs ; roll each in egg and bread-crumbs ; 
fry brown in hot lard ; put up to dry, and keep hot ; 
cut up in small pieces six lemons, six hard-boiled 
eggs ; dividing this into four parts, put one into 
each tureen, with a quarter of the balls in each ; 
then add to the soup one quart of red and one 
of Maderia wine ; give it one boil ; dip it upon the 
lemon, egg, and force-meat balls ; send it to the 
table very hot. This will make four gallons of soup. 
These are directions for a turtle weighing fifty 
pounds in the shell. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

The calfs head should be soaked in cola water one 
hour, and washed very dean. If a large head, allow 
six quarts of cold water ; boil it two hours, then add 
the liver and lights ; tie up the brains in a small 
cloth ; let them boil an hour and a half. Take up 
the head ; strain the liquor into a stone jar ; set it 
away fx> cool UTitil the next day. When the soup ia 



BOUP-MAEINO. 223 

to be made, take off all the fat ; put about one quart 
of the stock, one quart of cold water to boil, with 
two large onions, two carrots, two turnips, a stalk of 
celery, one dozen cloves, one dozen pepper-corns, 
one table-spoonful of salt ; boil it slowly two hours. 
Have a flat-bottomed soup-pot ; set it on the fire to 
get hot ; put a little butter in it, with two onions cut 
fine, to brown — a nice light brown ; stir them all 
the time to prevent burning ; dredge in a little flour. 
Have the calfs head cut in small pieces ; then strain 
the vegetables from the stock ; put all this into the 
soup-pot, and let it boil one hour. If you like the 
soup very dark, add one table-spoonful of allspice. 

TO MAKE THE BALLS. 

Take half a pound of raw veal, and some of the 
liver, lights, and brains ; chop them very fine, and 
season well with pepper, salt, ground cloves, sweet 
herbs ; drop in two raw eggs ; mix this well ; roll it 
into balls the size of a common nut ; roll them in 
egg and crumbs, and fry them in hot lard. 

Boil two eggs hard ; lay them in cold water until 
they are quite cold ; take the yolks, and mash them 
fine ; add half a table-spoonful of flour and a little 
salt ; mix this together ; then take a little into your 
left hand, and rub it with your right into a small 
ball ; make it all up into balls. Cut a lemon in 
small pieces. If the soup does not seem quite rich 
enough, take quarter of a pound of good butter ; 
braid into it a large spoonful of flour ; stir this into 



224 80UF^MAKIN0« 

tho soup ; let it boil about five minutes ; add a 
tumblerful of wbite wiue. Put the forco-meat balls, 
egg balls, and lemon into tho tureen ; turn the hot 
soup on to them. I think this soup as good as a 
turtle soup. 

A CLEAR SOUP. 

Gut up a largo shin of beef and one of veal ; put 
them to boil in ton quarts of water ; let it boil all 
day ; do not forget to skim it very well ; put in one 
dozen white pepper-corns, a few bits of mace, three 
bay leaves ; keep the pot covered tight that it may 
not require much more water, that is, that you may 
have about five quarts of soup. Strain it into a 
stone jar, and set it to cool. The next, day take off 
all the fat ; you will havo a strong jelly ; two hours 
before the soup is wanted, cut up four carrots, four 
turnips, and four onions ; just cover them with hot 
water, and set them on tho fire to steep two hours ; 
strain this into the soup-pot ; put in the jelly ; let il 
boil half an hour ; beat up three eggs and shells ; 
stir them in, and let it boil ten minutes ; set it back 
on the range where it will keep hot, but not boil ; 
add one cup of cold water ; if it requires any more 
seasoning, add a little essence of celery or cloves, or 
whatever you prefer, in the tureen. Strain the soup 
through a flannel bag as you would jelly ; if it cools 
it must be put into the soup-pot and^ heated over, as 
it must be served very hot. Put a pint of whito 
wine in the tureen if you like. 



80UFMMAKIK0. 22& 

POTATO SOUP. 

Boil four large mealy potatoes ; mash them fine ; 
add oue egg^ a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
tialf a teaspoonful of salt, a little essence of celery. 
Boil one pint of water, and one pint of milk or 
cream ; turn it on to the potatoes, &c., boiling hot ; 
stir it well ; strain it, and send to the table immedi- 
ately. 

ANOTHER POTATO SOUP. 

A nice soup with very little expense. If you have 
merely the carcass of any kind of poultry from a 
previous dinner, put it on to boil in about two quarts 
of water, with one large onion cut in small pieces, 
one carrot, one turnip, a little mace, or bay leaf ; let 
this boil three hours. Take six large boiled pota 
toes ; mash them fine ; add one egg, a little salt and 
pepper ; strain the soup on to this. There will be 
about three pints of soup ; add one pint of milk ; 
give it one boil^ and send it to the table. 

JULIENNE SOUP. 

Put a piece of butter the size of an egg into the 
60up*pot ; stir it until it melts ; cut three young 
onions fine ; fry them a nice brown ; then put in two 
quarts good veal or white stock, a little mace, pep- 
])or, salt, three young carrots, three turnips, a stalk 
f )f celery, a pint of green peas. Boil it all one hour. 
This is a nice summer soup.

TSaSTABLE SOUP. 

The same as above, with a young cabbage cut 
fine ; add beef stock, and season with doves instead 
of mace. 

VEBMICELU SOUP

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil a shin of veal in four quarts of water four 
hours; add pepper, salt, two onions, two carrots, 
two turnips, two dozen tomatoes ; boil one hour ; 
then strain out all the vegetables. Mix one cup of 
ground rice or arrowroot ; stir it into the soup ; add 
one cup of sugar ; give it one boil. Send it to table 
very hot Serve with it toasted bread cut in small 
pieces, and put in a dish to be passed to those who 
like it. 

ANOTHER TOMATO SOUP. 

If you have but little to make soup of, and want 
It without preparing the day before, put the bones 
into the pot with one onion, one carrot, and one 
dozen tomatoes ; cut the vegetables up ; pepper ; 
half a dozen cloves ; let this boil two or three hours ; 
strain out the bones and tomato seeds ; skim off the 
fat ; turn the soup back into the pot, with a cup of 
cold water, about two table-spoonfuls of arrowroot, 



80UP-MAKIN0. 227 

ground rico or flour ; stir this into the soup ; add 
half a cup of sugar ; let it boil ten minutes. Take 
some toasted bread, cut it into small square pieces, 
put them into the tureen, and dip the soup on to 
them. This, you perceive, costs but little, and helps 
your dinner a great deal. 

OYSTER SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

To two quarts of oysters put one quart of cold 
water ; wash out the oysters clean ; strain the water 
through a fine sieve or cloth. Put a piece of butter 
the size of an egg into a large saucepan ; dredge in 
some flour, a little pepper, and a very little mace ; 
turn in the liquor, and let it come to a boil ; put in 
two large spoonfuls of cracker-crumbs, mixed in a 
little water ; stir this well ; add a piece more butter, 
and then the oysters ; let it boil up once. Have 
ready in the tureen some soft crackers split and 
toaisted ; turn the soup in, and add a cup of white 
wine, or a spoonful of good vinegar or lemon juice. 

ANOTHEB OYStEB SOUP. 

A very good oyster soup may be made without 
meat. Strain off all the water from the oysters ; add 
as much hot water as you have oyster water ; add a 
little mace, pepper, and salt ; let it boil five minutes ; 
then put in the oysters ; let it boil up once. Havo 
ready some toasted crackers buttered ; turn the

A LOBSTEB SOUP 

May be made without meat. Cut the meat of 
lobsters fine. Break up the bones and shell ; boil 
them one hour in about two quarts of water ; straia 
out the bones, and put iu the lobster ; boil it half aa 
hour. Braid a little flour into a piece of butter the 
size of an egg ; stir this in, and let it boil once ', 
season it with pepper and salt, and a little vinegai- 
or wine. 

NOODLES FOB SOUP. 

Beat two or three eggs, add a little salt, and stir 
in flour enough till the mixture is as stiff a paste as 
can be rolled ; flour the rolling-pin and board so as 
to roll it smoothly. Boll it in three strips ; let them 
lay an hour to dry ; roll each piece in a long roll, 
and cut it in slices as thin as possible ; shake them 
apart, and let them lay and dry, as it makes them 
lighter, and prevents their sticking together. After 
the soup is skimmed drop the noodles in, and let 
them boil twenty minutes. Tliese are nice in any 
dark soup. 



FISH. 229 

MULLIGATAWNY 9DUP. 

Place in a stew-pan four ounces of butter, four 
large onions cut in slices, one carrot, two heads of 
celery cut small, and fry slowly till the onions are 
nearly melted and of a nice light brown ; then add 
as much flour as will thicken the quantity of soup to 
be made. Stir this over the fire for a few minutes, 
after having first mixed with it two or three table 
spoonfuls of the best curry powder, and then as much 
consomm^ of veal or white' stock as will make a 
sufficient quantity of soup. Now put it on the fire 
and stir till it boils ; then place it by the side of the 
fire to clarify in the usual way. Next rub it through 
a cullender into a pur^e ; pour it into a soup-pot, 
and place it again on the fire; let it boil ten 
minutes ; add the meat of a boiled fowl cut into 
small slices, free from bone, and the juice of two 
lemons ; skim thoroughly ; ascertain that the sea« 
soning is correct, and send to the table with some 
rice in a separate dish. 



FISH. 



CLUE CHOWDER. 



Have prepared the following : A good stock frpm 
veal or beef ; water will answer, but the chowder is 
better with stock. Boil twelve potatoes, and mash 

20 



330 nsH. 

tliom. Slice and fry brown six large onions. Soak 
two ship or other hard biscuit soft. Fry four slices 
of pork cut in small dice. Cut in slices about an 
inch thick eight pounds of fish : cod, sea-bass, had« 
dock, or black fish are the best. Have chopped fine 
three table-spoonfuls of parsley. 

Have a pot capable of holding three gallons, in 
which first put five or six table-spoonfuls of butter ; j 

scatter over one half of the fried onions ; add a table- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of black pepper, a tea- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg and ground clove mixed. 
Put in a layer of fish, and then a layer of mashed 
potato, and one half the biscuit ; add a bouquet of 
thyme or summer savory ; repeat the same opera- 
tion, leaving out the spice and thyme. Then pour 
in your stock or water, sufficient to cover the fish 
about four inches ; add the parsley, also the juice 
of a lemon, squeezed into a tumbler of water in which 
you have dissolved four or five lumps of sugar. 
Place it on the fire, and let it cook gently an hour 
and a half. Color the chowder a dark brown. It 
should be of the consistency of calf s head soup. If 
too thiti, thicken it with a little flour and water. 
The fried pork you can add before it is served, if you 
fancy it. I never use it. Just before serving, add 
a small tumbler of Maderia or sherry. 

Preserved mushrooms, clams, or oysters add to 
the flavor. If the quantity of spice does not suit the 
taste, .add as much more as you please. 



FISH. 23] 

QUAHAUQ CHOWDEB. 

The quahaugs should bo put into a pot with walcf 
enough to half cover them ; boil them twenty min- 
utes. Then take out the quahaugs, and make it 
the same as clam chowder. 

CLAM CHOWDER. 

Be very sure that the clams are fresh. One peck 
of clams put into an iron pot to boil with one quart 
of water. Cover very close to keep the. steam in ; 
when the clams open, turn them out into a large tin 
pan ; take out all the meat from the shells ; set 
them to cool. Strain the water back into the pot to 
boil ; just before it boils skim it well. Have peeled 
and sliced about six large potatoes ; put into the 
water to boil ; fry four slices of nice salt pork ; take 
out the pork ; slice up four onions very fine ; fry • 
them slowly until they are soft ; break up nine 
crackers fine^; put to soak in milk ; twenty minutes 
before dinner set the soup-pot on the fire ; put in 
the pork, onions, crackers, pepper, and salt ; turn 
the water and potatoes in ; stir it up ; rub together 
half a cup of fine cracker crumbs, a quarter of a 
pound of butter (having taken the black heads off 
of the clams) ; stir in the butter and clams ; boil 
slowly fifteen minutes. This makes a very superior 
clam chowder.

Should be always taken out, washed, and wiped 
dry. Grated fine, it is a great improvement 
sprinkled over any dish made of lobster ; or with 
hard boiled eggs and parsley, for any dish of fish. 

STEWED EELS. 

Cut the eels in pieces about four inches long ; 
wash them clean, and wipe them dry ; sprinkle a 
little salt and pepper over them. Cut three or four 
slices of salt pork, and fry them a nice brown ; slice 
an onion, and fry that brown; dredge in a little 
flour ; lay in the eels, and let them fry a little ; add 
one cup of hot water; cover them close, and let 
them stew twenty minutes. 

SWOBD-FISH 

Is best sliced and boiled, or stewed like tautog.

MEATS. 



BONED TUBEEY. 



Take a youug ben turkey weigliing about ten 
pounds ; clean it well, and wipe it dry ; lay it on a 
meat-board. Witb a sharp knife split down the 
back ; with a small, sharp-pointed knife take out all 

m 

the bones, beginning at the wing ; press the knife 
close to the bone, cutting slowly ; be careful not to 
cut the skin. After cutting the bones from the 
wings, cut to the breast-bone and draw out the bones 
of the breast and wings ; then cut round the leg. 
After drawing out all the bones, wash the turkey, 
and wipe it dry ; have ready a stuffing made of very 
fine chopped veal, two sausages, bread crumbs, mace, 
pepper, salt, sweet herbs, and a little ham or tongue, 
two raw eggs ; add a few truffles or mushrooms if 
you like (a few strips of cold boiled tongue, a few 
strips of very tender cold veal, laid into the turkey 
lengthwise, intermixed with the dressing, is a great 
improvement to the appearance when cut) ; mix this 
up well ; lay the turkey on the meat-board ; lay the 
dressing on, filling the wings, legs, and breast ; with 
a strong, fine twine and meat-needle sew up the 
turkey. Form it as well as possible with your hands ; 
skewer down the wings, tie down the legs. Break 
up two calf s feet, with the bones of the turkey, a 
little mace, pepper, salt, a carrot and an onion cui 



286 UMAVk 

into small bits ; put all into a covered saucepan or a 
soup-pot with two quarts of water ; lay the turkey 
on to the bones; let it boil slowly three hours. 
Take up the turkey, strain out the bones, beat the 
whites of two eggs ; put the liquor back to boil ; add 
the eggs and shells, one lemon cut small, and a cup 
of whito wine ; let it boil about five minutes ; set it 
back ; add one cup of cold water ; let it stand fifteen 
minutes; strain the liquor through a flannel bag. 
Put a pint into a small mould to place on the breast 
of the turkey, the rest on a dish ; when cold cut the 
jelly in square pieces, and lay them round the turkey 
to garnish the dish.

it on a tin sheet, put a spoonful of the mince into 
the middle, cut another piece of paste the same size 
and shape* and lay over it. Brush this over with the 
white of an egg, and bake it in a quick oven about 
fifteen minutes. 

Six or eight of these make a very pretty dish. 

PATTIES IN PASTE. 

Make a nice puff paste ; roll it very thin ; cut it 
into handsome shapes. Have ready some minced 
chicken or veal, seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, 
and the yolk of an egg ; lay this between two pieces 
of paste ; fry them in hot lard. Serve them stand* 
ing in a dish resting on each other. 

MUTTON CHOP WitH TOMATOES. 

Take about a dozen mutton chops, with the small 
bones in them ; pound them a little with the cleaver 
to make them smooth ; roll them in egg and crumbs ; 
fry them a light brown. Place some baked tomatoes 
in the centre of a dish and the chops round. them, 
with the bones meeting over the top. 

BBESLAN OF BEEF. 

Mince some cold roast beef and a little tongue 
very fine ; season it with a little pepper, salt, and 
one egg ; put it into a pretty-shaped mould ; turn it 
out on to a tin sheet ; brush it over with an egg; set 
il into the oven to brown. 



288 MEATS. 

GBATED HAM. 

Take the under part of a cold bam, which is rather 
hard to cat, and grate it up like cheese ; put it iata 
a stone jar. This is very nice for seasoning. 

DROPPED EGGS WTTH HAM. 

Have a small pan of hot water ; drop the eggs in 
carefully so as not to break the yolk ; with a spoon 
dip the hot water on to the yolk until a whito skiu 
forms over it ; then with an egg-slice take the eggs 
out carefully, one at a time. Drop the eggs on but- 
tered toast ; rub the egg lightly with a little butter ; 
sprinkle over it a little grated ham or flour. Seud 
to table plain. 

FBIED HAM AND EGGS 

Have a slice from the middle of the ham ; cut the 
rind, not the fat, off with a sharp knife ; rub the pan 
with a very little butter ; lay the ham in ; it will 
fry in its own fat. When the ham is done, that is, 
when the fat part is brown on both sides, take it up. 
If you have any fat that is dripped from a roast ham 
(that is best), put three or four large spoonfuls of it 
into the frying-pan ; when it is quite hot, break the 
eggs into it very carefully, one at a time ; with a 
spoon dip the fat on to the egg till you see a white 
skin form over it, then with an egg-slice lift it out so 
as not to break the egg. Lay the ham on the dish| 



MEATS. 239 

and the eggs round it. A dish of handsomely fried 
ham and eggs looks very tempting, but if the eggs 
are broken or fried hard, it is scarcely fit to eat 

FRIED OR BROILED SALT PORK.. 

Cut the slices even, not too thick;* cut the rind a 
little about two inches apart ; lay them into a clean 
frying-pan ; fry a nice yellow brown, first on one 
side and then on the other. Or, lay the slices on a 
gridiron, and broil both sides. 

pig's feet STEWEP. 

Half a dozen pig's feet into a saucepan ; cover 
them with water ; season them with pepper and salt, 
and an onion chopped fine, and a table-spoonful of 
vinegar. Stew them half an hour. Serve feet and 
gravy in the same dish. 

beefsteak and onions. 

Cut up six onions ; fry them in a saucepan in but- 
ter until a nice brown ; turn in half a cup of hot 
water ; dredge in a little flour, pepper, salt ; broil a 
beefsteak, lay it into the pan with the onions, co^r 
it tight, and let it stew about five minutes. Serve it 
very hot.

Add a cup of good beef stock ; cover tho pudding 
with the crust ; put on the cover of the mould, set. 
into the steamer to steam two or three hours, de- 
pending on the size. 



SALADS. 

CmCKEN SALAD. 

A PAIB of fowl weighing about six pounds will 
make a nice dish of salad. The chickens should be 
well boiled. Take off all the skin (some persons do 
not use the dark meat ; it is quite as tender as the 
white, and when dressed, does not show the differ- 
ence) ; chop the meat very line (be sure to take out 
all the little bits of gristle or sinews). Cut up three 
good heads of tennis-ball lettuce into quarters ; wash 
it all clean, and lay it in ice-water for two or three 
hours, that it may be crisp. If celery is used, split it 
fine, and put into ice-water as long as you would tho 
lettuce, as it must bo brittle to be good. 

LOBSTEB SALAD 

Cut the lobster in small pieces, but do not chop ifc 
Cif there is a roe or coral, as it is called^ in flia 



SALADS. 241 

lobster, wash it clean in cold water, wipt it dry, and 
grate it on a plate, and use it to ornament the salad). 
Put as much dressing as you think will eat well witli 
the lobster ; mix it up well with a fork and spoon ; 
then turn on a very little vinegar ; mix this well, 
and place it on a flat dish. Wipe the celery or 
lettuce as dry as possible, and lay it round the dish. 
This I do for dinner, that persons may bo helped 
to either lobster and lettuce, or lobster alone, which 
some prefer. 

CHICKEN SALAD, 

Made by not chopping or cutting the chicken, is 
very nice. Either boiled or roast chicken may be 
skinned, then pull the meat off the bone in small 
pieces, and dress it the same as other chicken salad. 
The chicken must be cooked very tender to pull off 
in nice pieces. For evening company it is best to 
cut the lettuce or celery, and mix with the meat or 
lobster, and servo it in a salad bowl. 

TO MAEE THE DRESSING. 

Take two hard-boiled eggs, lay them into cold 
water until quite cold ; put the yolks into a small 
wooden bowl; mash the eggs very fine with the 
"back of a spoon (I keep a wooden spoon and bowl 
for this purpose) ; add the yolks of two raw eggs, 
one large teaspoonful of salt, one large table-spoonful 
of dry mustard, a very little cayenne pepper ; stir 
this well, always one way ; when well mixed, add a 

21 



242 SALADS* 

rerj little sweet oil, stirring all the time ; after this 
is mixed well, put iu more, very little at a time, 
until you have used a third of a bottle ; then add a 
large spoonful of vinegar or lemon juice ; then more 
oil as before, using in all two thirds of a bottle of 
oil ; then another spoonful of vinegar. When well 
mixed, it must be very light and a nice color. Set 
it on the ice for two or three hours. Not more than 
twenty minutes before using the salad mix it, and 
prepare for the table by putting with the meat about 
half of the dressing ; stir it up well ; then turn on to 
the meat one wineglass of the best of vinegar ; stir 
this up well ; it will turn the chicken very wliite. 
If it requires a little more salt, add it now. Place 
the chicken in the centre of a flat dish large enough 
to lay the lettuce or celery round the meat. Wipe 
the lettuce as dry as you can, and lay it round the 
meat with a spoon ; put the rest of the dressing on 
the lettuce or celery. 

THE SALAD DBESSINQ 

May be kept a week by putting it into a stone jar 
covered close, and keeping it in the ice-chest. 

It is very convenient to place a glass jar of the 
dressing on the table with a dish of lettuce and a 
lobster opened, and served plain ; or if you wish to 
make a salad quickly, in case of unexpected com- 
pany, it helps to enlarge the dinner. 

Gold boiled potatoes or beets sliced, or a white 
cabbage cut fine and laid in ice-water, all make nioo 
tftlfldfti 



SALADS. 243 

A good dressing may be made without eggs to be 
a^ed immediately, but will not keep as the other. 
Use two very good boiled mealy potatoes instead of 
eggs ; mix it the same as the egg dressing. 

MOTONAIES OF SALMON. 

Boil the salmon as you would to serve plain ; take 
up on to a dish ; take out all the bone with a knife ; 
take off all the skin ; put it into a deep dish ; spread 
over it a little pepper, salt, a few cloves; just cover 
it with vinegar, and let stand until wanted. It is 
better to remain in the spice and vinegar over night. 
Lay on to the dish it is to be served on ; have the 
dressing the same as for lobster ; cover the salmon 
with a plenty of dressing ; have the salad the same 
as for lobster. This is a very nice dish — more of a 
variety than lobster, therefore more fashionable. A 
bass or cusk dressed in the same way is very good. 
Salmon trout is quite as good as salmon. 

Any kind of cold boiled fish left of a previous 
dinner, prepared in this way, is a piece of economy. 

A VEAL SALAD. 

Take a shin of veal, put it into an iron pot with 
six quarts of water ; add a little mace, pepper, and 
salt ; let it boil six hours. The water will bo almost 
absorbed ; pick out all the bones, and season it very 
well with ground mace, cinnamon, pepper, and salt ; 
add two teacups of very fine cracker crumbs ; stir 
them up well. Take a melon-shaped mould, cut 



244 yEGETABLEEL 

three hard-boiled eggs in strips lengthwise, rub tho 
mould with a little of tho juice of the meat, place the 
eggs round the sides of the mould, and fill it with 
the mixture, and set it away in a cool place. ] 

This is a very handsome dish to slice cold for a 
lunch or tea, or to place on a supper table, orna- 
mented with lettuce or celery.

gus ; lay them into the water ; let it boil fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Dish it on a slice of buttered toast ; 
sprinkle over it a little salt and a little butter.

pepper, and flour ; drop a small piece of butter into 
the frying-pan ; when it is hot lay in the plant ; fry 
it a nice brown on botli sides. 

EGO PLANT IN BATTER. 

Make a batter with an egg, a cup of flour, a little 
salt, water enough to make a thin batter. Dip the 
slices of plant into the batter, then fry them in hot 
fat a light brown. 

BAKED EGO PLANT. 

Cut off the stalk end about an inch and a half ; 
scrape out the inside with a spoon ; mix with this a 
boiled onion chopped fine, a cupful of fine-chopped 
meat of any kind, half a cup of bread crumbs well 
seasoned with pepper, salt, and spice of any kind ; 
drop in one raw egg ; mix this all up well ; fill the 
plant. Bake it half an hour. 

POTATO RICE. 

When boiling potatoes some are apt to get broken ; 
throw the pieces into a cullender ; rub them through 
with a spoon into a dish ; set it into the oven for five 
minutes. Dish as a vegetable, or garnish a tongue 
by laying it round the dish. 



VEGBTABLES. 247 

Eggs prepared in the same way make a pretty 
garnishing for side dishes of light meats. 

MACCARONI AS A VEGETABLE. 

Break up a vegetable dish half full of maccaroni 
in small pieces. Lay them in a saucepan, just cover 
them with water ; when hot, add half a pint of milk ; 
let it boil half an hour ; add a piece of butter half 
the size of an egg, a little salt, if you like, a table- 
spoonful of grated cheese ; stir this up, and serve in 
a vegetable dish. 

PEARS AS VEGETABLES, 

Or used instead of apple or cranoerry sauce. 
Take about two quarts of water that corned beef is 
boiling in ; put it into a saucepan with six good iron 
pears ; boil them an hour and a half. These are 
nice with corned beef. 

POTATO BALLS. 

Mash eight nicely boiled potatoes; add a little 
salt, butter half the size of an egg, two spoonfuls of 
cream ; stir it well ; roll it with your hands into 
balls ; roll them in egg and crumbs ; fry them in 
hot fat, or brown them in the oven. 

Sweet potatoes should always bo baked, as boiling 
in water spoils them.

morning turn off the water ; put the tomatoes in tlie 
preserving kettle to boil ; bo sure they boil. Have 
ready the cans, by filling them with hot water until 
hot, then turn out the water. Set them into hot 
water while filling, as it is very important to exchido 
the air entirely. It takes two persons to put them 
up well, one to fill the cans and the other to stop 
them up tight while hot. I use Knight's improved 
cans ; they are much less trouble, and if put up 
carefully, I think it as good as soldering. Any kind 
of can is good which keeps out the air eutirely. 

PUTTING UP SWEET CORN. 

Use the very best young corn ; put it to boil 
fifteen minutes ; with the liandlo of an iron spoon 
scrape all the corn from the cob ; then put the corn 
to boil with a little water, just enough to keep it 
frobi burning. When boiling hot, put it into tin 
cans, and seal them immediately. When wanted to 
use, put it into a saucepan with a very little milk^ 
butter, and salt ; cook it fifteen minutes.

PASTRY. 



PUFF PASTE. 



Wash the butter in cold water ; slap it into a thin 
cake, and lay it on the ice to get perfectly aold. To 
a pound of butter take a pound of flour ; mix half 
of the butter with the flour, wet with ice-water just 
enough to stick it together ; roll it out to half an 
inch thickness, put on half of the butter that remains 
in small bits ; dredge thi3 with flour ; roll up the 
paste, then roll it out again, thin ; put on the rest of 
the butter ; roll it up and out again three or four 
times. The more it is rolled the more flaky it will 
be. This must be done quickly, taking care not to 
handle it any more than you can possibly help. Put 
it on the ice to keep cool until the fiUihg for the 
pies is prepared. Butter the plates, then roll out 
the covering of tlie plates, and put it on them. 
Then roll a long strip to cut for the rims ; brush 
over the rim with cold water, with a paste brush, and 
between each layer. This makes the paste more 
puffy. Fill the pies; cover them with the crust 
rolled quickly ; brush the top with the white of an 
egg beat up. This gives a glossy appearance when 
baked. Bake in a quick oven. 

A PASTE TO KEEP ON HAND. 

Take two cups of butter, one of lard, six cups of

roll it up ; then roll again ; roll it up in a clean 
cloth, and lay it on the ice to keep. Wlien wanted 
for use, roll out the paete, spread ou a little butter, 
dredge on a little flour ; roll it up ; then roll it out

Put six table-spoonfuls of flour into a dish with 
six eggs, a little salt, a gill of milk ; mix these well 
together with a wooden spoon ; add by degrees three 
gills more milk ; mix it up well. Put it in a tin dish 
that will just about hold the batter ; set under a 
piece of beef that is roasting about an hour before 
serving, until it sets and turns rather brown on top ; 
then turn it into the dish you intend to serve it in, 
and set it before the fire to brown on the other side. 



25C CAKES. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLING 

Roll out either potato or short paste ; cut. it large 
enough to cover an apple peeled and cored. When 
the apple is covered, place the dumpling on a tin 
baking-pan. Set in the oven to bake one hour, and 
served with wine sauce. 

PUDDING SAUCE. 

Beat to a cream half a pound of butter and half a 
pound of white sugar. It must be well beaten or 
your sauce will not froth. Boil a small tumbler of 
wine and one of water together ; stir, this and the 
butter together very quickly ; it will be a perfect 
froth. Send it to the table as soon as made ; add a 
little nutmeg or essence of any kind. Do not put it 
on to the (ire after it is mixed, or you will spoil the 
frothy appearance. 



CAKES. 

ON CAKE-MAKING. 

Always sift the flour, wash the butter, sift the 
sugar, break the eggs into a cup for fear there may 
bo a bad one, stone raisins, wash and dry currauts, 
cut citron in small pieces. When commencing, 
have all the materials ready and weighed or meas* 
nred, and the pans buttered, that you may keep 
beating until the cake is ready for the oven ; you 



OAEES. 257 

are more likely to have good cake, than if obliged to 
beat a little, and then take your hands out to pre- 
pare other ingredients. Lino your cake pans with 
buttered paper, the cake is not so apt to burn ; it is 
well to have a clean paper ready to put on the top 
if the oven is too hot. In putting the materials to- 
gether, butter and sugar should bo beaten together, 
and eggs beaten separately, as the whites need more 
beating than the yolks. Butter the pans, as any 
other fat may leavo an unpleasant flavor. 

ICEING FOR CAKB. 

The whites of two eggs to a pound of very fine 
white sugar, with a very little vanilla or orange- 
flower water ; beat them together until very light. 
Have ready in a cup a little lemon juice. Begin to 
lay on tlio iceing in a very thin coat with a knife ; 
occasionally dip the knife into tho juice ; when it is 
covered, set it in a warm place to harden, then it 
will be ready for the next coating, which will be 
much smoother and whiter than the first.

gether ; whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff frotli,

about an inch thick ; bake it a light color. Have

it in a quick oven half an hour ; try it with a broom 
straw; if done, the straw will come out clean, if not, 
the cake will stick to the straw. You must not take 
the cake out of the oven to try it, as it will not be 
light if removed from the oven before it is baked 
enough.

PRESEBVEa 

BBANDT PEACHES. 

Turn boiling water over the peaches ; lot them 
stand, covered up tight, twenty minutes ; with a 
cloth take off all the skin. Have ready a syrup of 
half tho weight of fruit ; put just enough peaches to 
swim on the top ; let them boil fifteen minutes ; 
take them out on a dish to cool them. To a quart 
of syrup, put one quart of brandy. Put the peaches 
into tho jars; cover them with tho brandy and 
syrup, and cover them very tight, to exclude all the 
air 2^t a time, until you have boiled them. 

APBICOTS AND PLUMS. 

The same as peaches. 
23 



268 PBESEnTESL 

BBANDT PEABS. 

Peel tbein with a knifo very nice and oven to look 
well; boil tliein in water fifteen minutes ; lay them 
on a flat dish to cool. Make a syrup half the weight 
of the fruit ; put the pears in to boil fifteen minutes ; 
let them cool. Put them into the jars ; fill the jars 
half full of syrup and the rest white brandy. 

CUttBANT JELLY. 

Take a very strong thin cloth ; mash the currants 
with your hands until they are thoroughly broken ; 
then put as many into tiic cloth as you can squeeze 
by taking each end of the cloth ; wring them very 
hard. Two persons can do much better than one, 
for it requires a great deal of strength. When the 
juice is all extracted, measure a pound of sugar to a 
pint of juice ; let it boil about fifteen minutes ; 
strain it into the jars. Small jara are best for jelly ; 
let them stand uncovered exposed to the sun for 
three or four days. Wet a paper with brandy ; lay 
on the top of the jelly. Cut paper largo enough to 
tie down round the jar ; brush the paper over with 
the white of an egg ; with your finger press it down 
close and tie it tight, — or a bladder is still better. 

CANNING Famr, or preserving peaches. 

I always use the best of fruit for preserving. 
Take nice free-stone peaclies, rather hard ; lay them 
into a pan ; turn on boihng water enough to cover 
them; cover them tight to keep the steam in ; lot 



them stand until the water is cool onough for you 
to liandle them ; peel them with your fingers rather 
than a knife. Allow three pounds of sugar to nine 
pounds of fruit; put the sugar into the preserving- 
kettle, with one cup of the water that the peaches 
were scalded in ; set it on the fire, and stir it until 
the sugar is melted. Put in as many peaches as tlie 
svrup will cover ; let them boil about fifteen minutes. 
Rinse the cans out with boiling water to heat them. 
Put the peaches boiling hot into the cans ; set the 
cans in hot water while filling ; pour the syrup over 
them, and cover them tiglit. These will keep as 
well as if one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 
Any kind of fruit may be done in this way. 

PRESERVED BARBERRT. 

To a pound of fruit a pound of good brown sugar. 
To a peck, one quart of cold water ; let it boil up 
once ; then set it aside, and let it simmer one hour. 
This is very nice to put into water to drink ; in case 
of sickness it is very cooling. 

EGO PLUMS. 

Turn on boiling water, and let them stand five 
minutes ; or put them into a cullender, set that into 
a deep pan, then turn on boiling water. As soon as 
the skin cracks, lift out the cullender and peel the 
plums. This will prevent breaking the plums by 
handling or moving them. Then make the syrup, 
pound for pound. Boil th6 fruity and wb^n done, 



268 PBBSEBTES. 

lay them on a flat dish to cool. Put them into jars, 
and pour the hot sjrup over them. Close the jars 
tight. 

DAMSON PLUMS. 

Pick them over ; be sure they are clean ; leave 
the stems on. Make a syrup of one pound of sugar 
to one pound of fruit ; half a gill of water to a pound. 
When the syrup just boils, put in the plums ; let 
them simmer about three quarters of an hour. Put 
up in glass or china jars; stop tight. All small 
plums may be preserved in the same way. 

no TOMATOES. 

Get very fine small yellow tomatoes. Make a 
syrup of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; cut 
up one large lemon, or a cup of preserved ginger, to 
every pound. Boil the tomatoes until tender ; lay 
them on a dish to cool ; add the lemon or ginger to 
the syrup, and let it boil up once. Put the tomatoes 
in jars ; turn the hot syrup over them, and cover 
them tight. These will keep very well, being better 
the second season than when first done. 

THE STRAWBEBBT TOMATOES, 

The same as above. 

STEWINO DBIED FRUIT. 

Cover the fruit with cold water ; let it soak three 
or four hours; then let it boil until tender. Add 
sugar to the taste. Do not stir the fruit much while 
it is stewiugi as it would break it, and make it un- 
sightly.

Put the nuts back into the jar. Boil as much cider 
vinegar as will cover the pickles ; to every gallon, 
add half an ounce of whole cloves, three ounces of 
horse-radish, half an ounce of mustard-seed tied up 
in a little bit of muslin ; when all is boiling, turn 
it on to the nuts. Cover them tight. In two weeks 
they will be ready for use. 

MABTINOES. 

Wipe them clean, and put them into a firkin. 
Put one quart of coarse strong salt to a pail of 
water ; boil and skim it, until the salt is all melted ; 
put this on to the martinoes, and let it stand two 
days and nights; then drain them off; wash out the 

24 



278 UASINQ PICKLIS. 

firkin, and put ihM martinoes into it. Put to boil 
enough vinegar to cover them, and with it a small 
bag of cloves and allspice; turn the vinegar over the 
pickles boiling hot, and cover them closely. In two 
weeks they will be fit to eat, but better in two 
months. 

HIZED PICELE3. 

Break up i^ cauliflower, very tender string beans, 
and some very small onions ; a red pepper cut in 
small pieces ; some little long green pepper, and 
some little yellow tomatoes ; scald them in salt and 
water, and let them stand twenty-four hours. Drain 
them from that, and put them into a jar or pan ; 
turn boiling vinegar over them ; let them stand 
until cool enough to put into glass bottles ; stop them 
tight. 

In making pickles, the articles must bo freslv 
gathered, and use the best of cider vinegar » or you 
cannot have good pickles. 

PICKLED MACKEREL. 

Take four dozen of small mackerel (what are 
called tinkers) ; cut them open a little way to clean 
them, and wash them in salt and water ; lay them 
into a baking-pan. Sprinkle a plenty of fine salt, 
pepper, cloves, and allspice ; add vinegar enough to 
bake them in. Bake them about fifteen minutes ; 
lay them into a stone jar; sprinkle a little salt 
between each layer. Have on the fire vinegar 
enough to cover the mackerel, with whole cloves and 



HOMEMADE WISE. 270 

allspice. When all the fish are baked and in the 
jar, turn the vinegar over them ; cover them tight 
These are very nice to use as you would sardines for 
luncli. 

POTTED MACKEREL. 

Place a layer of small fish in a stone jar ; then 
sprinkle salt, whole peppers, cloves, and allspice ; 
then a layer of fish, and so on till the jar is nearly 
full. Then cover with vinegar, and put a paper over 
the top of the jar, and a paste made of rye meal. 
Bake it slowly four hours. Take off the crust ; do 
not allow any of it to fall into the fish ; keep covered 
close. These will keep six months. 



HOME-MADE WINE 

PINE-APPLE CHABTPAGNE. 

Cut the rind ofi* six good ripe pine-apples ; lay it 
into a jar with one gallon of cold water; let it stand 
to ferment ; strain it ; sweeten it with loaf sugar to 
the taste. Bottle it, tie down the corks, and lay the 
bottles on the side. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

Put two quarts of raspberries into one quart of 
the best of wine vinegar ; let it stand in a cool place 
twenty-four hours ; strain it through a cloth to get 



280 HOME-MADE WINE. 

all the juice ; put it into a preserving-kettlo, and 
when it almost boils skim it well, and add two 
pounds of loaf sugar ; dissolve it and skim it, tiicn 
strain it. Bottle, and cork it tight; it will keep a 
year. A spoonful of this in a glass of water is very 
cooling in summer. 

GUBBANT VnNB. 

Mash and squeeze the currants through a coarse 
strong cloth. To a gallon of juice, add one quart 
of water, two pounds of good loaf sugar ; stir this, 
and set it away in a large stone pot ; let it stand two 
weeks. There will be a thick scum ; take this all 
off, and add one pint of good rum or brandy ; put it 
in a demijohn ; stop it tight. 

CHEBBY BOUNCE. 

For ten gallons, have a ten gallon keg half full of 
the very best now rum ; fill it full of black rum 
cherries fresh picked from the trees ; stop it tight. 
Let it stand until the next spring ; then drain off all 
tlie juice ; turn out the cherries ; put in two gallons 
of water, and let them soak until the next day. Put 
to the juice two pounds of loaf sugar to a gallon ; 
put it back into the keg. Wash out the cherries 
from the water, and strain it into the keg ; stop it 
tight , let it stand until fall, and then bottle it. 

UiC brandy instead of rum if you prefer ; but 1 
think good rum is better than common brandy. 



HOBIE-HADB WINE. 281 

BLACKBEBRT CORDIAL. 

Place the berries in a kettle over the fire, with a 
vqrj small quantity of water in the bottom of the 
kettle ; let them boil soft. Then strain them through 
a bag until the juice is all separated from the seed. 
Put the juice on the fire again, and sweeten to the 
taste with white sugar ; throw in a little bag of stick 
cinnamon. Let it boil twenty minutes or half an 
hour ; take it off, and stir in the brandy or whiskey, 
making it as strong as desired. Bottle, and seal it 
with wax. 

If it is desired to make jam as well as cordial, 
merely dip or pour off the juice, not quite all, from 
tlie stewed berries. Then add a little water and 
sugar (brown if you please), and stew them down 
for jam. 

GINGER CORDIAL. 

Four pounds of red or white currants ; half pound 
of bruised ginger ; two ounces of bitter almonds ; 
the juice of three lemons, and the rind of one lemon. 
Put the above into a gallon of whiskey ; let it stand 
ten days ; then strain it twice, and add five pounds 
of white sugar. Bottle it for use. 

GINGER BEER. 

Two ounces of ginger ; one pint of molasses ; half 
a pint of good yeast ; one gallon of warm water. 
Put this into a stone jug ; shake it up well ; set it to 
rise for twelve hours ; then stop it tight, or bottle it. 

24* 



382 mscEUiANfiQiTa. 

DANDEUON BfiEB. 

To a peck of dandelions, one pail of water ; put it 
into a pot to boil about t\70 hours ; strain it into a 
jug or keg ; add one quart of molasses, and one 
pint of good yeast ; set it to rise twelve hours. Bo^ 
tie it, and tie down the cork. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

LABDING. 

Labdino is to cut salt pork in fine strips (jon 
can find larding-necdles at anj kitchen furnisliing 
store). You can see by that bow thick the strips 
are to be, as they are to be put into the needle, and 
drawn through the meat about an inch apart, and 
one inch long. 

CRUMBS FOB SMALL BIBDS. 

Lay some fine crumbs into a baking-pan ; set them 
:n the oven ; stir them often until a light brown. 
Take the pan from the oven ; add a little butter, 
stirring all the time until the crumbs have absorbed 
the butter, and look dry. Sprinkle these over any 
kind of small birds, and round them. They garnish 
the dish sufficiently. 



A NICE BROWNING. 

Put a pound of sugar iato a saucepan ; let it 
melty as if to make caudj, and brown ; then add a 
pint of water ; stir it for about ten minutes. Turn 
this into a bottle, and stop it tight, and use it instead 
of soy to brown soups or gravies. 

CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

Take half a pound of chestnuts ; break off the 
shells ; turn on to the nuts a quart of boiling water ; 
let it stand ten minutes ; take off the brown skins. 
Put the nuts into a saucepan with a pint of white 
stock ; let them boil an hour and a half, or until sof/ 
enough to mash through a sieve ; then add a little 
lemon, cayenne, and half a pint of cream; let it 
simmer, but not boil, stirring all the time until 
served. 

CHESTNUT DRESSING FOR TURKEY. 

Boil the chestnuts, peel them, mash them fine, 
and season them the same as dressing made of bread 
crumbs. The French chestnuts are less trouble 
because larger, but no better than any other. 

EGG sauCe for nsH. 

Boil four eggs hard ; drop them into cold water ; 
when cold take off the shell ; take out the yolks ; 
chop the whites ; rub the yolks through a wire sieve 
or tin cullender. Put all the eggs into the sauce 
dish ; add one pint of drawn butter, a little popper, 
salt, and lemon juice. 



284 mSCELLANBOUB. 

TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. 

Two small squares of chocolate ; Ciut it up fine , 
put into the chocolate pot ; turn on to it two cups 
of boiling water ; stir it up ; set it to boil ; then add 
two cups of milk ; let it boil up once. Sugar to the 
taste. 

NEW YEAE'S egg NOGO. 

Beat the yolks of five eggs and five table-spoonfuls 
of sugar together ; grate into this one nutmeg ; add 
half a pint of brandy, stirring constantly. Beat tho 
whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and mix them 
nicely with the above ; then stir in one quart of good 
milk ; grate a little nutmeg over the top. 

OMELETTE FOE ONE PEBSON. 

Beat three eggs very well, a very little salt, a lit- 
tle pepper. Put a bit of butter, not more than a 
teaspoonful, into the omelette pan ; stir it round 
quickly; as soon as hot turn in the egg; keep the 
pan moving slightly. As soon as tho egg is set, 
turn it half over, slip it on to a dish, and send it to 
the table hct. If it stands it is spoiled. 



USEFUL HINTS. 285 



USEFUL HINTS. 

k coiK should always, when setting away what h 
ld?t from dinner, bo careful to put each meat by 
itself on a clean dish, and put the gravy with it, in 
order that she may be able to make a nice dish of 
what cold meats she lias ; for it is very great economy 
to make a relishing dish of what she has left, witliout 
as much expense as a plain dish would cost. Some 
cooks think they must have all kinds of sauces to 
season a made dish ; but every dish is better to taste 
well of whatever it is made of, without the disguise 
of spices and sauces. I like a bright seasoning of 
onions and vegetables, a little spice, and some sauce, 
but not too much. We have so many vegetables, 
such as celery, parsley, mushrooms, besides so many 
dried sweet herbs, that we cannot be at a loss for 
good flavcripg. But all these things must be used 
with good judgment. Some cooks use a great quan- 
tity of butti^r, but their cooking is not so good as if 
they used it aacre prudently ; too much butter spoils 
everything. You should try out the fat of poultry, 
and keep eao^. kind by itself to baste with. 

Pieces of stale bread should be kept clean and dry. 
Every two or three days put all the small pieces you 
Lave on a tin &heet, and set it in the oven with the 
door open to dry. When very dry, pound them fine, 
and sift them, tlirough a coSurso sieve or fine cul« 



288 mtftSL HiNts. 

lender. The fine crumbs arc good to use in frying ; 
the coarso ones are good fcH* puddings. Tiie soft pare 
of pieces of bread should bo used for dressing for 
meats, which would save cutting a whole loaf for 
that purpose. If care is taken of the pieces of bread 
in a family, a great saving may be made, for broad 
is a large item in family expenses. Soft crackers 
pounded make the best crumbs to use in frying, also 
in scalloping oysters. 

The dripping of beef and pork, clarified, is very 
nioo to fry in, instead of lard or butter. To clarify 
it, put the drippings into an iron pot ; to a quart of 
fat allow half a pint of cold water; let it boil until 
the water is boiled out, which may be known by its 
not bubbling. When the water has evaporated, 
strain it into an earthen pot, and keep it in a cool 
place for use. 

The fat from soup stock, and all other fat that 
with proper care accumulates in a kitchen, may be 
used for making soft soap with but very little trouble, 
and a great saving may be made thereby, as it is 
much better than the soap that you get in exchange 
for your house grease. 

ON ROASTING MEAT. 

When roasting meat, have a clear good fire ; set 
tho tin^kitchea back from the fire ; Utrii the -^it 



USEFUL HINTS. 287 

often until the meat gets hot ; then bast6 with the 
drippings from it, or the fat of the same kind of meat 
that has been clarified, for if you are not particular 
in this you cannot preserve tho true flavor of the 
meat 

Veal may be basted with a little butter for the last 
basting before dishing, as for poultry ; but beef and 
mutton with its own dripping from the tin-kitchen. 
Dredge on a little salt and a little flour, and baste 
well about twenty minutes before dishing, and the 
meat will bavo a rich brown frothy appearance. 

FOR RESTORING MEAT. 

If a little spoiled, lay into a pan ; turn over it 
some good vinegar, rubbing it all over. Let it laj 
one hour ; then wash it out of this ; lay into cold 
water for one hour ; wipe it dry ; cook it. It will 
be perfectly sweet. 

TO SAVE COOEINQ FAT. 

Beef, pork, and veal drippings, that is, what you 
turn out of tin-kitchen or meat pan (leaving the last 
drippings to make tho gravy for your meats, as I 
have before directed), that is fat. This you keep 
al] together in a jar. Once a week put it into a 
saucepan ; add half a pint of cold water. Let it 
boil about twenty minutes, and then strain it into a 
jar. Tliis is very good to use as you would butter, 
or to fry in cooking. 



288 USEFUL HINTS. 

TO SAVE SOAP GREASE. 

Keep a small earthen pot near the sink when jou 
wash dishes ; scrape every little bit of fat into it. 
Every day scrape this into a largo pot until you get 
it full ; put this into a pot with a pint of cold water, 
and let it boil. Keep the pot covered tight, that 
you may not get the scent of it through the house. 
Keep an old cullender over the top of a firkin where 
the grease is melted; turn it into the cullender. 
When the grease is strained out, put the rough 
grease into another firkin. This clean grease is 
what you may make soft soap with. The rough 
grease sells for six cents per pound, if you do not 
wish to make soap ; the clean grease may be sold 
for nine cents per pound. You perceive by this lit- 
tle care and trouble, your soap grease is worth half 
as much again as if it was all put into the firkin 
together. 

TO MAKE SOFT SOAP. 

Take seventeen pounds of potash to twenty of 
grease ; lay the potash at the bottom of tho barrel. 
Boil tho grease, and pour it on ; put in two pailfuls 
of scalding water, and stir it all together. Fill up 
tho barrel the next morning with cold water ; stir it 
up from time to time, and in three days it will bo 
fit for use. 

ANOTHER SOFT SOAP. 

This answers for common purposes, but not 
good for clothes as tho former : — 



CLEANING. 289 

Take three pots of concentrated Ive (it comes in 
little tin pots) ; take off the tops, ana put them in a 
kettle that will hold three pailfuls ; add eight pounds 
of good grease, and two pailfuls of water ; let it boil 
until all thp lye melts out of the cans. Put this into 
the soap barrel, and fill it up with liot water. This 
is much cheaper than potash soap. 



CLEANING. 



TO GLEAN MARBLE. 



Take a little soft soap and pumice-stone on a 
flannel ; rub it all over, then wash it off, wipe dry, 
and rub it with a'clean cloth. But if it is spotted, 
send it to be repolished. 

TO CLEAN FURNITURE. 

For . polished furniture : an eqi^al quantity of 
spirits of turpentine, sweet oil, and beeswax, melted 
together. Wipe all the dust off; then rub some of 
this mixture on to a good, stout piece of woollen 
cloth ; rub the article well, and then polish it with 
some old soft silk. For varnished furniture : wipe 
the spots with a soft wet cloth ; wipe them dry. 
Then with a piece of cotton flannel dipped in a little 
sweet oil, wipe the article; rub.it clean with old 
silk. . 

25 



290 CLEANING. 

CLEANING WINDOWS. 

Wash them first with warm water and a sponge ; 
then dry them with old linen, and rub them clear. 
Polish them with old newspaper. 

When cutting up old linen sheets, I take the best 
pieces, about the size of a towel, turn down the edge, 
and run it with a long stitch. It does not take long 
to do this, and it makes nice window cloths because 
not linty. 

CLEANING PAINT. 

With warm water, a little soda, soap, and very fine 
pumice-stone and a flannel cloth, rub the paint all 
over ; then rinse oflF the soap well, and wipe it dry. 
Always in cleaning paint rub up and down, not 
crosswise or round and round. 

CLEANING SILVER PLATE. 

Take some good fine whiting wet with water (or 
if much tarnished, use alcohol) ; rub the article all 
over with a soft cloth dipped in the whiting (use a 
soft brush for the chased work) ; let it dry. Then 
have some hot water with silver soap, or good soda 
soap ; with a soft cloth wash oflF the whiting, and 
with a clean brush wash the whiting out of the 
chased work, and wipe quite dry with a clean old 
soft cloth while hot out of the water. Nothing will 
make silver look as well, and keep clean as long. 

In cutting up old table cloths, I hem the best 
pieces for wiping silver. The oldest are better for 
cleaning it than a sponge. 



CLEANING. 291 

FOB CLEANING TIN. 

Take fine house sand and soft soap ; a good piece 
of cotton flannel ; have a tub with some hot soap- 
suds and a clean cloth ; take the tins on a table ; 
rub hard with the soap and sand until you remove 
all the dingy appearance. Then put into the tub ; 
wash it clean from the soap and sand. Put them in 
the sun to dry, and when dry, polish with a clean 
cloth and a little dry whiting. 

CLEANING BRASS. 

Nothing so good as fine rotten-stone and sweet 
oil. Bub hard to take off all the spots ; then rub 
off all the oil* with a clean piece of flannel and dry 
rotten-stone ; polish. 

TO GLEAN CABPETS. 

Have them well shaken, and when nailed down, 
sweep them clean. Take half a pail of warm water, 
half a cup of ammonia ; stir it up ; and then with a 
clean flannel cloth wrung out, wipe the carpet all 
over. Leave the window open to dry a few hours. 

ANOTHER BECEIPT. 

Take a bullock's gall in half a pail of warm water ; 
wring out a flannel cloth, and wipe the carpet all 
over. If you wish to take out grease spots after the 
carpet is shaken before nailing down, place the spot 
across a tub, or large bowl ; have the water very hot 



292 CLEANINQ. 

with gall in it ; turn it on to the spot Tory slow ; let 
it run through until the grease is out, and then rub 
it dry with a cloth. 

CLEANING STRAW CARPETS. 

Sprinkle a little Indian meal over the carpet; 
with a flannel cloth and warm water wash the carpet 
clean, and wipe it dry. Do not use much water, 
nor wash straw carpets often, for it softens the straw. 
They do not wear as well as when wiped over with 
a damp cloth. 

^ CLEANING SILK. 

One cup of alcohol ; one cup of soft soap ; one cup 
of water ; half a cup of molasses ; mix this well 
together. With a flannel cloth or nice spongo wipe 
the silk over on both sides ; then with a hot iron 
press it very smooth on the side you intend to make 
the wrong side. I have only tried this on blaok 
silk ; it gives it a gogd color and stiffness.

CmLDKEN'^S TABLE. 311 

If an early dinner is required for ddults, what is 
.ftft from the parlor dinner, if enough, can always 
be made good (if properly done) by warming over; 
and almost all kinds of meat are nice, cut cold, if 
when put away they are put on clean dishes, — not 
all put together, and made unsightly and disagree 
able by the carelessness of the cook. 



CHILDREN'S TABLE. 

Where there is a family of children, it "is desirable 
they should have their meals at an equal division of 
the time of the day ; therefore, if they breakfast at 
seven, dine between twelve and one, and take tea 
at six, it is much better for them than late dinners. 
Children are much better if not allowed to eat at 
all times in the day. If they require anything 
between meals, let what they have be very simple, 
such as an apple, cracker, or a piece of bread and 
butter ; then they have an appetite for their dinner. 
Their digestive organs should not be kept always 
at work. If children are allowed to eat at all hours 
in the day, their stomach soon gets out of order, as 
a natural consequence. Their food should be good, 
plain, tender meats well cooked. Cooks are rather 
apt to be careless with this early dinner, if not made 
to understand that it is of the utmost importance that 
children should be very well taken care of. Inter- 
est the cook for the children, and one great point is 
gained for your comfort and theirs.

DINNERS. 

Roast beef, not too much done, with dish gravy ; 
boiled potatoes; a dish of boiled macaroni or rice; 
a tapioca pudding. 

Fowl, boiled in about three quarts of water, a 
cup of rice, a spoonful of salt, and, if not very 
young children, an onion, tvo turnips, two carrots, 
boiled in the soup. This is a very nice broth, and, 
with the chickens served separately with drawn 
butter and boiled potatoes, makes a very good 
dinner. If the chickens are very old, boil them two 
hours ; if not, an hour and a half. A good baked 
bread pudding and cold sauce. 

A quarter of roast lamb ; good potatoes, mashed ; 
green peas, well boiled ; a dish of wine curd. 

A dish of fried or boiled fish is very nice. Al- 
most all children like it. A good sago pudding. 

A small leg of mutton- boiled, or roasted, with 
potatoes. Stewed tomatoes are very healthy, and 
some children like them. . A dish of blanc mange. 

A broiled beefsteak, with potatoes, peas, and 
beans. A baked rice pudding. 

A veal pie is nice, if well made ; if the meat u 
well cooked, and the crust is made of raised dough, 
it will be very light. A corn-starch pudding. 

If there is not a large family of children to pro 



children's tabls. 818 



vide for, meats that are left from the pailor dinner 
can be served very nicely and to advantage. 

Pieces of cold roast beef laid into a pie-dish with 
a little of the gravy, a dozen tomatoes peeled and 
cnt np; then another layer of beef, some nice mashed 
potatoes spread over the top about an inch thick, 
brushed over with egg, set in the oven and browned, 
make a nice, healthy dish. 

A quart of white soup stock, with some tomatoea 
stewed in, and strained to take out the seeds and 
skins ; a cup of rice boiled in this until the soup is 
a|)sorbed ; then some pieces of any kind of tender 
meat put in and covered with rice ; cover the sauce- 
pan tight, and let it stand until the meat is hot. This 
makes a very nice dinner for children. 

Veal minced fine, and warmed with a little butteri 
is nice, if well prepared, to eat with potatoes. 

Fresh fish and potatoes, chopped fine and warmed 
with a little butter, is nice. 

Children are generally very fond of baked beans, 
but they should be very well cooked to be good. 

Any kind of tender meat warmed for a child's 
dinner should not be fried, but heated in a manner 
to keep it moist and tender. Meat or poultry, put 
into a saucepan with a little salt, very little pepper, 
a little butter, and a cup of water, and boiled up, is 
very nice. Rice, macaroni, and vermicell], are very 
nice, boiled with the meat, for children.

DIBECTIONS FOR A YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER 

As much of the comfort of a household depends 
upon the state of the kitchen department, I will 
endeavor to aid the young housekeeper in making 
ber arrangements. 

Presuming that a range is in the kitchen, with the 
usual quantity of utensils fitted into it, it is quite 
as necessary to have other articles to be used upon 
it, such as copper saucepans, well lined, with covers, 
from three to six different sizes ; a flat-bottomed 
80up.pot; an upright gridiron ; sheet-iron breadpana 
instead of tin ; a griddle ; a tin kitchen ; Hector's 
double boiler ; a tin coffee-pot for boiling coffee, or 
a filter — either being equally good ; a tin canistei 
to keep roasted and ground 'coffee in ; a canister for 
tea ; a covered tin box for bread ; one likewise for 
cake, or a drawer in your store-closet, lined with 
sine or tin; a bread-knife; a board to cut bread 
upon ; a covered jar for pieces of bread, and one 
for fine crums; a knife-tray; a spoon-tray; — the 
yellow ware is much the strongest, or tin pans of 
different sizcb are economical; — a stout tin pan for 
mixing bread; a large earthen bowl for beating 
cake ; a stone jug for yeast ; a stone jar for soup 
stock; a meat-saw; a cleaver; iron and wooden 
spoons ; a wire sieve for sifting flour and meal ; a 
small hair sieve ; a bread-board ; a meat-board ; a 
lignum-vitao mortar, and rolling-pin, &o.

uil-clothy and suitable dishes, to lodnce your cook 
to have her table in good order for the servants ; 
half a dozen rollers, one dozen dish-towels, one 
dozen towels for glasses, dish-cloths henuned, coarse 
cloths and holders for the range. Keep a small jar 
near the sink, to be sure to save all the scraps of 
grease, and once a week boil it up and strain it into 
a firkin; and when you have obtained twenty 
pounds, you can make a barrel of soft soap ; painted 
covered pails and boxes, for all kinds of groceries, 
in the store-closet, so that when anything is brought 
inte the house, it may be put into its proper place 
at once (for if it is put into the closet, in a paper 
bag, it seldom finds its way there); a large tin 
6pice-box, or small wooden ones marked for the dif- 
ferent spices ; a good painted cover for flour-barrel ; 
a large ice-chest for the cellar, for meats, butter, 
&c. ; a keg or half-barrel, half filled with good brine 
for salt pork ; one also for salt beef; boxes or bas- 
kets for vegetables, which one can easily move when 
sweeping. 

For the washroom, have a place for tubs, pails, 
and baskets ; bags or baskets for clothes-pins and 
clothes-lines; clothes-horses, large and small; a 
dumb-betty is the best machine in use for washing ; 
an ironing blanket and sheet; a dress-board and 
bosom-board, well covered. 

When the girls have done washing, all the tuba 
and pails should be washed clean and put in their 
proper places, and the wash-room cleaned before tht 
cIotlieB are brought ia for folding* 



S20 DnDBonosB tob ▲ toting houseeebpeb. 

See that your store-closet and larder are filled 
with all that is necessary, and then make it a mle 
with your servants, that before any of the different 
articles should be used up, they should report to 
the mistress, as it is very inconvenient, when mak- 
ing preparations for a dinner or other meal, to wait 
until you can replenish whatever is wanted. 

When yon have everything arranged, you should 
make it a rule with yourself and servants to keep 
everything clean and in its place ; and therefore it 
is best to have a fixed time to perform every duty. 
Tou must begin systematically yourself, if you 
expect it of others. The best time to arrange your 
household for the day is directly after breakfast. 
Consult with your cook ; provide what is wanted 
for dinner. If you have anything left of the day 
before, that will help make it out, arrange it with 
her then. Oive your orders decidedly and dis- 
tinctly ; — and now is the best time to say what you 
will have for tea and breakfast, and if anything is to 
be prepared over night for the next day's dinner, as 
this gives the cook time to make ^1 her arrange- 
ments without haste, and leaves the mistress free 
from annoyance the remainder of the day. The 
cook should have regular days, after washing and 
ironing are over, for cleaning her closets, tins, and 
larder, sweeping out her cellar cleaning her eniriea 
and cellar*8tairs. 

The chambermaid should have her days for wash 
\ag and ironing, sweeping, cleaning window*, ailv^

Ac. In this way your honso will be kept in order ; 
everything will be done well and in time. 

The morning is the best time to work ; therefore 
if your servants know just what they have to do^ 
and if they are faithful, they will set themselves 
about their work earlier than if they were obliged 
to wait for their orders each day ; and each servant 
should know exactly what is expected of them, and 
if left undone, the responsibility will rest with them 
alone. 

If a servant omits his or her duty, it is best to 
speak of it at once, for perhaps they can give a sat* 
isfactory excuse for not having done it; if not, 
reprove them quietly and firmly. If this method 
should be adopted when you first take a servant 
into your employ, in nine cases out of ten you will 
have a good servant in the end; but if you let 
faults pass without reproof, after a time servant* 
become careless; you become impatient, change 
and often do not improve the matter. 

Servants should be treated kindly, but with deci- 
sion. Let them feel that you have confidence in 
them, and that you are careful that every inmate of 
your household is comfortable and well taken care 
of, and that you expect them, in return, to make 
you comfortable by doing their duty promptly and 
cheerfully. When this is understood, more interest 
will be found among servants, and they will have 
fuU credit for their faithfulness. 

Bo careful not to suspect a servant's honesty 
without a good reason for doing so ; for their char

actor may be all tbey have to depend on. But li 
they are untruthful or dishonest, tell them so plainly 
as it may be the means of saving them from de 
^truction. Be sure that you are truthful with them. 
Be ready to give them a just character when called 
upon. It is a mistaken kindness to keep back a 
servant's real faults, and a want of candor to the 
person to whom you give their character. If they 
leave, or you send them away for some particular 
&ncy of your own, do not prejudice any other person 
against them, for every one does not require the 
game services of a servant.
