THE purpose of this book is to assist the 
house-lceeper and hostess in selecting a 
menu suitable for the most elaborate repast 
or the simplest meal ; to enable her to esti- 
mate the cost of either at average market 
prices — allowing for local differences; to 
know how to prepare and serve each dish 
and to provide a quantity sufficient for six 
persons. 

It is not designed to instruct beginners 
in minute details pertaining to the proper 
preparation of dishes in daily use, or the 
entire duties of a waitress. These depart- 
ments have already been ably treated by 
other writers. 

The author's intention is to put before 
her readers a book which will enable them 
to practise both economy and hospitality, 
and to make it possible for the inexperi- 




PREFACE 

enced to calculate exactly the cost of a projected entertaiiimentj 
how to cook it and how to serve it. This may be accomplished 
by learning thoroughly the resources and average prices of local 
markets. 

Many house-keepers with small incomes wish to gather their 
friends around their tables, but hesitate to do so because of the 
incalculable expense of both time and money ; this book has 
been compiled to meet such a difficulty, and to show that 
guests can be lunched or dined in a dainty and charming man- 
ner at a very moderate cost and a small expenditure of time, 
which is of much importance to the busy house-keeper of 
to-day. 

Ordinary dishes are supposed to be familiar to every house- 
keeper, so that directions for many such are here omitted. Re- 
cipes requiring elaborate preparation and much ornamentation 
are either simplified or omitted altogether. 

Effort has been made to give recipes a little out of the ordi- 
nary, such as one may like to place before guests 'who recog- 
nize and appreciate the finer etTects of seasoning and serving. 
Most beginners in house-keeping have been so engrossed with 
school duties and the business of getting an education, that the 
minor details of serving a meal have escaped their observation. 
The few hints about serving contained in this little book will, 
it is hoped, meet this emergency. There is also an attempt to 
assist the novice in selecting recipes which harmonize, where it 
is thought necessary to serve two or more dishes in the same 
course. 

The Index gives the price as well as the name of each dish, 
so that in planning an entertainment one can readily select a 
menu within the sum apportioned.

'pVERY recipe in this hook is sufficient for six per- 
sons, all measurements are level, and one cupful 
is half a pint. 

A " Cover " is the place at table for each guest and should 
consist of the plate, napkin, knives, forks, spoons, and glasses 
necessary for the meal. 

A " Service " plate is placed on the table before guests are 
seated and is not removed until the first hot course after soup. 

Table linen should be laundered without starch and ironed 
while very damp. Table-cloths should be folded once in iron- 
ing and rolled on a stick or laid in loose folds to avoid creases. 
Napkins should be folded four times in ironing, then folded 
once more with the hand to hold the bread or roll, and should 
be placed at the left of the forks. If a service plate is not used, 
put the napkin holding bread in its place directly in front of 
each guest. 

To saute means to cook in a very small amount of butter, 
fat, or oil until brown, in a frying or saute pan. 



HINTS TO THE NOVICE 

To fry means to plunge into deep, hot fat and cook until 
brown. Always use a wire basket for this purpose, only cover 
the bottom of the basket with articles to be fried and do not 
have them touch each other. 

To crumb and fry means to dip in crumbs, which must be 
dry and powdered fine, then in slightly beaten egg mixed with 
very little water and in crumbs again, then plunge into deep, 
hot fat and cook until brown. Test fat by dropping in a small 
piece of bread ; it should brown in 1 minute for uncooked 
mixtures and in 40 seconds for cooked mixtures. 

To crumb means to cover with fine crumbs and bits of 
butter and brown in the oven, or cover with crumbs which 
have been sauted in butter until brown, and place in oven for a 
moment. The proportion to use is ^ c. crumbs to 1 tbsp. 
butter. The latter method is the most satisfactory if done 
properly. 

Use pastry flour for pastry and all baking-powder mixtures ; 
for everything else use bread flour. 

Croutons for soup: Cut buttered bread into ]4-'mch cubes 
and brown in the oven. 

To lard meat, poultry, or sweetbreads : Draw strips of pork 
through meat with larding needle, which may be bought for 
the purpose, or it may be done at the market by an experienced 
butcher. 

Serving from the side means from the butler's pantry or 
from a table behind a screen. 

To marinate means to mix with an oil or vinegar dressing, in 
which the article is left for a certain time. 

Everything pertaining or belonging to one course should be 
removed before the next course is served, except the wine- 
glasses. These should remain on the table from the beginning 



HINTS TO THE NOVICE 

to the end, the only exception being the glasses for cordials and 
liqueurs, which are served after the coffee, which is sometimes 
served in the drawing-room. 

In removing a course take large dishes or platters first, then 
the plates and silver from each "cover." The carving knife 
and fork should be side by side on the platter. 

Every dish should be passed to the left with the handle of 
the serving spoon or fork on the side toward the guest and 
within 4 or 5 inches of the table, so that guests may help them- 
selves without reaching. Plates containing individual portions 
should be placed from the right and removed from the right. 

The foundation of all dinners should be soup, meat, and 
vegetables, salad and dessert. Of luncheons, soup in cups, meat 
or fish entree, salad, and a sweet. All other courses may be 
added at discretion. 

Bread, butter, rolls, bread -sticks, and water should never 
be asked for. A careful waitress will see that these are well 
supplied. 

The hand-tray should be covered with a doily, clean ones 
being at hand to replace soiled ones. This is to avoid the noise 
and clatter of dishes. 

In preparing for an entertainment the hostess would save 
time and avoid confusion by making two copies of the menu, 
one for the butlei 's pantry, containing directions for serving, and 
the other for the kitchen, giving details and recipes for cooking 
and the time each course should be ready for serving. 

Attention is called to the special mention of dishes which 
may be prepared several hours before serving or final cooking, 
thereby enabling the hostess to give the artistic touch which 
would be lost if obliged to crowd them in with the necessary 
things which always seem to multiply at the last moment. 




PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. 

THESE recipes are divided into sections containing ingredi- 
ents required, under the headings A, B, C, etc., followed 
by method or rule for combining, cooking, and serving. In 
many cases the method is given at the beginning of sections 
containing a number of recipes so similar that it would be 
needless to repeat them, as the general directions are sufficient. 
The abbreviations are : 

c. for cupful or >^ pint. tbsp. for tablespoonful. 

qt. for quart. tsp. for teaspoonful. 

pt. for pint. lb. for pound, 

doz. for dozen. m. for minute. 



Wherever possible recipes are represented by measurements.

" With a few friends, and a few dishes dine, 
And much of mirth and moderate wine." 

— Cowley. 



THE FORMAL DINNER 

A DINNER of twelve or more covers, to which formal 
invitations have been sent, should consist of eight to 
twelve courses, rather less than more. Careful atten- 
tion should be given to the selection of each course 
that it will so harmoniously blend with the others 
that the result may be a gastronomic symphony. 

Although violent contrasts must be offered to pique 
the appetite, the dinner should rise from a mild be- 
ginning, gradually increasing in force until the piece 
de resistance^ or roast, is reached, then should dain- 
tily descend to the dessert ; and with the coffee and 
cordials will come the satisfaction to the diner that 
he has been gloriously entertained, but not repleted. 

The fastidious individuality of the hostess should 
always be en evidence, and one with many servants 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

may, with propriety, make this a most elaborate 
affair ; but with a little forethought in selecting a 
menu containing dishes which may be prepared in 
advance, some even the day before, the inexperienced 
house-keeper will be able to offer her guests a dainty 
repast, pleasing to the eye as well as to the palate, 
with a small number of assistants — one to cook, one 
or two to serve, and one to lend a hand will be all 
that are necessary. The experienced house-keeper, 
however, will be equal to the occasion with even less 
assistance if she will give her attention to a few well- 
selected courses cooked to perfection and daintily 
served. Avoid ostentation ; remember that simplicity 
is the ruling spirit of the day. There have been so 
many excellent books written giving directions for 
the care of the dining-room and its accessories that 
many details will not be mentioned here. The writer's 
intention is only to suggest to the young house-keeper 
the best and simplest methods of arranging a table 
and of serving and removing each course. 

The cover and arrangement of the table are of the 
utmost importance, as the slightest departure from 
mathematical regularity and immaculate cleanliness 
is slovenly and must not be tolerated by our hostess 
of to-day. 

A round, square, or oblong table covered with a 
thick cotton-flannel cloth or pad under a fine linen 
damask without crease or wrinkle, and the best you 
can afford, is the first requisite. On rare occasions 
this cloth may be of satin damask or of handsome 
lace over satin, but if this is attempted, all of 



DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS 

the table appointments must be equallj'- "smart," 
and the dinner itself must be an epicure's dream. 
Whether this cloth be simple or sumptuous, it must 
hang over at least a quarter of a yard on every 
side. 

The place for each guest and the necessary plate, 
knives, forks, glasses, etc., constitute the cover. 




The Cover. 



The next consideration is this cover or place for 
each guest. Allow at least twenty inches for every 
person, and more, for elbow room, if you can spare it. 
At each cover place the best ten-inch plate you have ; 
this is called the service-plate and should be placed 
on the table before dinner is announced, to be left on 
until the fish or first hot course after the soup is 
served. It is now considered good form always to 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

have a plate in front of each guest until dessert, but 
this is an unimportant detail and depends somewhat 
upon the number of servants ; the hostess should suit 
her own convenience. The service-plate should be 
placed exactly in the middle of the space allotted to 
each person, and about an inch from the edge of the 
table. Place at the right of the service-plate as many- 
knives as will be required before the dessert, each one 
with the sharp edge turned toward the plate and in 
the order in which they will be needed, beginning at 
the extreme right. At the right of the knives place 
the spoon for soup, which should be a table-spoon or 
soup-spoon, with the inside of the bowl turned up ; 
then the oyster-fork or small fork for canapes. At 
the left place as many forks as will be needed before 
the dessert, unless you are to have many courses, when 
too much small silver would look like display. Place 
forks in the order in which they are to be used, the 
fish-fork at the extreme left and the entree fork next ; 
then the fork for the roast, which, of course, should 
be the largest ; then the fork for game or salad, all 
with the tines turned up, the last fork close to the 
plate. If sherbet is served it is a temptation, if you 
have choice spoons, to place them on the table from 
the beginning, but it is in better taste to have them 
on the plates with the sherbet. If on the table they 
should be outside of the oyster-fork, or for a luncheon 
in front of the service-plate, as there are not so many 
glasses to take the room. If more knives or forks are 
required, they may be quietly placed at the covers 

just before the course needing them is served. If 

4 



DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS 

there are not many courses, the dessert fork and spoon 
may be on the table from the beginning. Place the 
fork next to the plate with the other forks, and the 
spoon in front of the plate beneath the sherbet-spoon 
if it be used. 

At the upper right hand of the plate, near the cen- 
tre, place a goblet for water ; then place the wine- 
glasses in the order in which they are to be used, 
beginning near the points of the knives, reaching to 
the goblet in a semi-circle. If many wines are served, 
a double semi-circle may be formed, beginning with 
the sherry-glass and ending with the goblet. (See 
diagram of cover.) 

The napkins should be large and of fine quality. 
They should be folded in ironing four times ; then 
when ready to use fold them once with the hand, 
slipping between the folds, but in sight, a dinner-roll, 
bread-stick, or piece of bread cat two inches long by 
one and a half thick. Place the napkins at the left 
of the forks if there is space, otherwise place them 
on the service-plate. 

If dinner-cards are used, and they usually are for 
convenience in seating the giiests, they should be 
placed upon the napkin. These cards may be plain 
and small, with only the name of the guest written 
upon them, or they may have also in the upper left- 
hand corner or centre the monogram or initials of 
the hostess, or a dainty hand painting ; any of these 
are correct and in good taste. 

An allowable exception to the general rule of " no 
furbelows" is the name of the guest in silver or gilt 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

lettering on the end of a ribbon. This ribbon may be 
narrow and tied around a bunch of flowers, or it may 
be broad and laid flat between the covers, the other 
end connected with a basket or bunch of flowers, 
these bunches or baskets forming the centre-piece, 
which, of course, is demolished when the repast is 
over. Let it be thoroughly understood, however, that 
these favors are only for ladies. 

Menu-cards are seldom used at small dinners, un- 
less there is an artistic or amusing feature to be illus- 
trated ; men and women are expected to be sufiicient- 
ly entertaining to require no literary or childish aids 
to conversation. The practical object of the menu- 
card is to give guests an opportunity to save capacity 
for specially delectable courses, but this will not be 
necessary in the dainty dinners which our hostess 
will give. 

Much attention should be given to the selection of 
guests and placing of name-cards at the covers to 
insure a successful and harmonious entertainment. 
There should be good listeners as well as fine talkers, 
and here the tact of the hostess is called into play 
to avoid anything like a contretemps. The hostess 
should either tell each gentleman, as he is received, 
the name of the particular lady he is to take out to 
dinner, or the name should be written on a small card 
and placed in an envelope addressed to the gentleman 
and put in a conspicuous place in the dressing-room ; 
R. or L. in corner of card designating the side of table 
on entering room. When dinner is announced, the 
host offers his arm to the lady for whom the dinner is

DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS 

given, or the one who is to be seated at his right, fol- 
lowed by the guests, the hostess closing the procession 
with the gentleman to be honored or the one whom she 
intends seating at* her right hand. 

A few hints regarding the decoration of the table 
must be given here, though the fashion of to-day may 
be out of date to-morrow. Perhaps one feels inclined 
to be in touch with the latest whim, especially if it has 
a raison d'etre. Extreme simplicity, and a desire for 
artistic effect combined with the practical, is the order 
of the day. The appearance of millinery must be 
avoided, consequently lace and ribbon furbelows are 
not used for the adornment of the table. A centre-piece 
of fine linen, or the flowers in the pattern of the table- 
cloth, exquisitely and delicately embroidered— or a fine 
linen, with insertion and border of heavy altar-lace, 
and glass or silver bowls and vases filled with an ar- 
tistic arrangement of flowers and vines — are a sufiicient 
embellishment for the most elaborate feast, although 
small bunches of flowers, or single flowers placed at 
each cover, are a delicate attention much appreciated 
by the ladies, and in perfectly good taste. Let the 
hand of madame be manifest, and beware of the wiles 
of the florist. Small silver or glass dishes, containing 
relishes, bonbons, and salted nuts, are usually placed 
on the table, though fashion decrees now that their 
place is on the side-table ; but with the possession of 
antique silver and Venetian glass one may dare, to be 
a little less up to date. The same may be said of 
choice decanters and coasters — one can hardly be ex- 
pected to put them out of sight. It is scarcely neces- 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

sary to say that butter-plates should, not be placed on 
the table at a formal repast. It is supposed that care 
has been taken to supply each course with all require- 
ments in the way of seasoning and sauces, and condi- 
ments are served as they are needed. 

An important feature of the entertainment is the il- 
lumination, and it requires more serious consideration 
than is usually given it. Unless the hostess is in the 
first flush of youth, and her guests are all equally for- 
tunate, she should eschew all abominations in the way 
of glaring, unshaded ceiling lights, whether of gas or 
electricity. The most effective and artistic illumina- 
tion is a soft light from candles or lamps, not higher 
than the head of the tallest guest, and if this is not 
sufficient, it should come from the sides of the room, 
or from a low, shaded centre chandelier, and never from 
near the ceiling, high over the heads of the guests. 
Such a light, which always throws sad shadows upon 
the faces of beautiful women, makes mournful the 
most joyous occasion. 

There are two ways of serving a formal dinner, both 
equally "good form," and the one chosen should de- 
pend upon the convenience and taste of the hostess. 
The most formal way, and perhaps the most conven- 
ient, if there is the helping hand in the butler's pan- 
try, is to serve each course from the pantry neatly 
arranged on individual plates, the butler or waitress 
having the tray in the left hand, putting the plate con- 
taining the portion upon it, taking it to the right side 
of each guest, and with the right hand placing it upon 
the service plate until after the soup or bouillon course 



DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS 

■which is removed with the service plate, then setting 
it in front of the guest and close to the edge of the 
table. Then, if anything is to be served with the 
course, it should be placed on the tray and passed to 
the left side of each guest, being held low enough to 
enable the guest to help himself with his right hand. 

If it is desired to follow the fashionable method of 
always having a plate before each guest until dessert, 
then the tray should be dispensed with in placing the 
course. Remove from the right with the left hand and 
place the following course or empty plate with the right 
hand also from the right. Guests should be served in 
rotation, beginning alternately at the right and left of 
the host and hostess, going in opposite direction for 
each successive course. 

The other and more simple way of serving is to have 
the course artistically arranged and cut in small pieces 
on a large dish or platter, accompanied by the neces- 
sary serving-spoon, knife, or fork, and put on a tray, 
or, if too large, held in the hands carefully and offered 
to the left of each guest — of course, after plates, knives, 
or forks for the course have been placed. To remove 
each course, wait until everyone has finished, then 
take the tray in the left hand and with the right hand 
remove the plate from the right, placing it on the tray. 
If the knife or fork is accidentally left on the table 
by a thoughtless guest, it should be taken up quietly 
and put on the plate on the tray. Do not remove more 
than one plate at a time, or all belonging to the course 
at each cover. It is very bajd form to pile one plate on 
top of another when clearing the table. If it is not 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

convenient to take so much time, dispense with tlie 
tray and take one plate in each hand, thns removing 
two at a time. Remember this is the formal dinner, 
and there is supposed to be plenty of time and numer- 
ous servants. 

Wine should be poured into the glasses from the 
right, and should follow the serving of each course. 

Black coffee in small cups, followed by cordials in 
tiny glasses, is the last course, and should precede the 
finger-bowls, unless the fashionable method is ob- 
served of serving coffee and cordials to the ladies in 
the drawing-room, while the gentlemen are left at the 
table to become anecdotal over their cigars and their 
liqueurs ; then the finger-bowls should be placed be- 
fore the ladies leave the table. 

It is considered qiiite " smart " in some social circles 
to serve cocktails just before dinner is announced or im- 
mediately after the guests are seated at table, and this 
appetizer is a twin to the fashion of cigarette-smok- 
ing during the dinner and after by the ladies ; but our 
hostess of to-day will lose no friends by excluding this 
pair of bohemians from her dinners and luncheons. 

There are two things to remember — that guests are 
invited for social intercourse, and that the machinery of 
serving should run so smoothly and quietly that there 
will be no interruption to the conversation. The most 
successful entertainment is the one that is so simply 
and quietly served as to be beyond criticism. The nat- 
ural desire to exhibit rare possessions of silver and glass 
should be the only excuse for departing from the fash- 
ion of the hour, which, let me repeat, is simplicity.

DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS 



THE INFORMAL DINNER 

The informal dinner, or the family dinner with the 
addition of two or more guests, should be served almost 
like the formal dinner by the hostess having several 
servants. The few exceptions are that the soup may 
be served by the hostess from a tureen on the table, 
the assistant taking one soup-plate at a time from the 
sideboard, placing it in front of the hostess, then when 
filled placing it on the service-plate of each guest from 
the right. Fish may be served by the host, and passed 
in the same manner as the soup. Large platters should 
always be used when carving is done at the table ; if this 
is not convenient, then a carving-napkin may be on 
the table in front of the host from the beginning, to be 
left on until the table is cleared for dessert. Entrees 
are always served from the side, and the roast is carved 
by the host. All vegetables and sauces are placed on 
the side-table and passed to the left of each guest 
when required. The host or hostess makes the salad, 
and the hostess serves the dessert and pours out the 
coffee. Coffee should be placed at the lower right 
hand of the guest, and cream and sugar passed to the 
left. The bonbons and relishes may be upon the 
table and the number of courses should be less than 
for a formal dinner. Really this is the dinner that 
should be served everj^ day by the ambitious house- 
keeper, no change being necessary for an extra guest 
or two. The service of wine is entirely a matter of 

choice or opinion. Both formal and informal dinners 

11 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

are in equally good taste without wine as with it. As 
very few persons are able to partake of every dish that 
is offered them, the same may be said of wine. Ex- 
perienced diners will always refuse anything that is 
to them especially injurious, and are expected to do 
so, but it is bad form to parade one's objections; a 
quiet refusal by a glance or a motion is all that is 
necessary. 

The suggestions given thus far are for house-keepers 
with more than one servant. Realizing that there are 
many would-be hostesses who are fortunate enough to 
be able to run the domestic machine with one maid- 
of-all-work, the following suggestions are for their 
benefit : 

The table should be set as for the informal dinner, 
but it is well to remember that there is only one pair 
of hands to do both cooking and serving. The service- 
plate should be omitted, all the knives and forks to be 
used may be put on the table, salts and peppers at the 
corners of the table, or one of each for every two per- 
sons. Small round plates for the butter-ball and slice 
of bread or dinner-roll which should be put on be- 
fore dinner is anno^^nced, are placed at the left of 
each cover, and the small butter-knife, if one is used, 
placed on the plate with the bread. Goblets should be 
filled with iced water, and everything needed should 
be on the side table before guests are seated. De- 
canters, bonbons, and relishes may all be on the table 
from the beginning. The plates for each course 
served on the table should be placed in a low pile, 
not more than three or four at a time, in front of 

13 



DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS 

the host or hostess, the maid taking each one as it 
is filled, putting it on her tray and placing it in 
front of each guest from the right with the right 
hand. 

Further suggestions will be given with each course, 
but the writer would advise an ambitious house- 
keeper, who wishes to understand thoroughly all of 
the details of the business of house-keeping, to secure 
some of the books making a specialty of each subject 
and to study them. A particularly good one is 
"The National Cook Book," by Marion Harland and 
Christine Terhune Herrick. 

This work is only an attempt to awaken the average 
house-keeper to the fact that she can serve her family 
and entertain her friends without drudgery and vrith- 
out extravagance. It only requires brain, good taste, 
and tact to make the home a veritable Garden of 
Eden, only our modern Eve sautes or souffles the ap- 
ple before she gives it to Adam. It was undoubtedly 
a fit of indigestion from eating raw food which caused 
the first Adam to " peach." 

THE FORMAL LUNCHEON 

The formal luncheon is served like the formal 
dinner, with the following exceptions : If the table is 
of very handsome wood, without scratch or blemish, 
it may be left bare, using small doilies under the 
plates and dishes, and a centre piece. This is a rare 
opportunity to display artistic embroideries, but the 
fine damask table-cloth is always in good taste and 

13 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

there is a faint rumor that the bare mahogany is 
going out of style. 

When luncheon is announced, the hostess asks her 
friends to follow her to the dining-room, without -for- 
mality. 

The soup is served in two-handled cups, the heavy 
roast or piece de resistance is omitted generally, and 
very few vegetables are served. The hostess may 
serve the salad, the dessert, and the coffee, although 
these are more often served from the side. Wines are 
not always offered, and never more than one or two 
kinds. Sauterne being the favorite wine for ladies' 
luncheons, an opportunity is given to exhibit rare and 
daintily colored glass. A fruit, tea, or wine punch is 
often served in the place of wine. It is poured from 
handsome glass or silver pitchers, and cordials are 
served after the coffee, which is served at table. 

THE INFORMAL LUNCHEON 

This is the ordinary every-day luncheon, and is like 
the informal dinner, except that no roasts are served. 
Tea may be served by the hostess, with the tea-pot, 
sugar-bowl, cream-jug, and cups and saucers neatly 
arranged on a large tray under a cloth, or the tray 
may be omitted, using only the cloth or napkin. 

Two or more courses may be served, all of the 
dishes for the first course neatly arranged on the table 
and the second course, the sweets and cakes, placed 
on the side table ready for use, followed by finger- 
bowls and fruit. These suggestions seem so unneces-

sary and such every-day affairs that many will won- 
der why they are put in this book, but most 
house-keepers will appreciate the fact that these 
simple instructions have to be told over and over 
again to the new waitress or maid-of-all-work, and 
if putting this book into the hands of the pupil 
will save the weary Tiaus-frau a few hours of pre- 
cious time, worthy of something better, its object will 
have been accomplished. 




These dishes are -usually served as a first course 
at dinners or luncheons, and are supposed to be 
appetizers. 

At the formal dinner or luncheon they are placed on 
the service-plate after the guests are seated. At the 
informal meal they may be brought in before the meal 
is announced, or they may be placed after the guests 
are seated. - Only serve one of the dishes in each 
course, and avoid all through the meal repetition 
of food or flavor. 

Canapes are sometimes served instead of oysters, 
but at a formal dinner or luncheon they usually 
precede the oysters, this being the only exception to 
this rule. If you servo oysters as a first course, do 
not serve them again during the dinner 
or luncheon. Tiny sandwiches of entire 
wheat, graham, or brown bread and butter 
or dainty biscuits or crackers are served 
with raw oysters and clams ; also fringed 
celery, trimmed radishes, or cress may ac- 
company "Some Beginnings." 

After this course is served, fill the glasses three- 
quarters full with Sauterne from a glass pitcher or 
decanter.

CANAPES 

Canapes are savories or appetizers usually served before the 
first course at dinners and luncheons, and often in the place 
of oysters or clams. They should be served on very small 
plates and placed at each cover. At d gentlemen's dinner 
they are sometimes served to the guests in the drawing-room 
or library just before dinner is announced, accompanied by a 
glass of sherry or a cocktail, but when ladies are present, this 
attention is quite sensibly omitted. 

Method. 

Cut six thin slices of bread into small oval or oblong pieces, 
toast, fry in hot fat, saute in butter, or dip in melted butter 
and slightly brown in the oven, spread with any of the Fla- 
vored Butters or plain butter, cover with a relish or savory,

At a formal dinner a consomme or light cream soup 
should always be served unless the courses are very 
few and rather light, then a bisque or puree is admis- 
sible. It should be served from the side table or but- 
ler's pantry, in ten-inch soup-plates, a scant ladleful 
in each, a table-spoon or soup-spoon being already on 
the table. Terrapin soup is an exception, as plates 
for terrapin are about eight inches, and a terrapin- 
spoon or dessert-spoon may be used. Chowders and 

oyster soups are often served 
in these small plates, as they 
are- so rich and thick that a 
small quantity suffices. 

At the informal dinner any 
of the soups are served from 
the butler's pantry, or at the 
home dinner by the hostess 
from a tureen on the table, a 
ladleful in each plate. In re- 
moving this course, take the 
tureen first, then the plates. At 
a luncheon, bouillon or any of 
the cream soups, bisques, or purees are served in 
bouillon-cups. They are always served from the

bread-sticks or bread-slices replenished. 

Celery and the salt-cellar, with spoon, may also be 
passed if it is used at all.

Ant number of entree courses may be served, but 
care should be taken, however, not to repeat materials, 
sauces, or flavors. 

One or two entrees are suflBcient unless there are to 
be many courses. They are served from the side with 
a table-spoon of the required sauce on each plate 
which is placed at each cover from the right, or the 
sauce is poured over the whole dish and it is passed 
to the left of each guest. 

After all have finished, remove plates from the 
right. Serve claret from a decanter 
or bottle. 

Many quite palatable entrees may 
be made from "left overs," especially 
if these "remnants" were not too 
much cooked when making their first 
appearance. However, this, at best, 
is only a makeshift, for the perfect 
dish should be pre- 
pared, cooked, and sea- 
soned for the purpose 
for which it is intend- 
ed, if it is to be a " mas- 
terpiece."

poultry for entries : 

CREAMED MEAT OR POULTRY

meat, which is improved by marinating ^ an hour in French 

Dressing N"o. 436. Add seasonings, fill dishes, 

cover with browned crumbs and bake 5 m., or 

crumb and brown in the oven, or fill pdte or 

paper cases and serve hot without crumbs.

Meats, roasts, or poultry, if served from the side, 
should be neatly carved in the butler's pantry and 
placed on the largest-sized dinner-plate, which should 
be very hot. One or two vegetables usually accom- 
pany the roast ; if two, one is of potatoes. A fruit rel- 
ish is often served with the piece de resistance, and 
sometimes Bouchees Savory are served instead of po- 
tatoes. These should be passed to the guests from the 
left, unless they are already put on the plates. If a 
vegetable requires small dishes or plates, place them 
at the left of each cover, but it is considered much 
better form to serve vegetables dry enough to be put 
on the plates with the roast. To remove this course, 
if carved on the table, first place. the carving knife and 
fork carefully on the platter, side by side if the 
carver has neglected to do this ; remove the platter, 
then all the plates or dishes belonging to the course 
from each cover. See that goblets are filled, not too 
full. Pass bread, if it is needed, and serve cham- 
pagne. iJfotice if guests prefer other wine, and keep 
the glasses filled until after dessert is served. 

To serve champagne, cut the wires and draw the 
cork carefully ; have a napkin wrapped around the 
neck of the bottle, and, as soon as the cork is drawn,

pour a very little into the glass of the host to 
giving a guest any particles of cork ; then begin 
right of the host, fill the glasses slowly 
and not too full. Champagne is some- 
times served from a glass pitcher. In 
that case it is not necessary first to pour 
any in the glass of the host. Do not 
serve ice with champagne or with any 
wine, but champagne must be kept on 
ice for several hours before it 
is used, and should be poured 
the instant it is opened. The 
napkin around the bottle is to 
protect the wine from the heat 
of the hands and to protect the 
table-cloth from drops.

Sherbet, sometimes called sorbet, which is a frozen 
punch or ice, is served as a course in the middle of a 
dinner or luncheon. It is supposed to have a stimu- 
lating effect upon the digestive organs, thereby en- 
abling the diner to appreciate what follows after. 
This course always precedes the game or salad, and is 
served in small glasses on a small plate or saucer, with 
a doily between, and a small spoon. These are al- 
ways arranged in the butler's pantry ; a heaping table- 
spoonful of the sherbet, which should not be frozen 
too hard, will be suflScient for each glass. Sometimes 
sherbets are served in candy cups or fancy paper 
cases, but the glasses that are made for the purpose 
are in better taste, unless something very artistic is 
accomplished. These are placed in front 
of each guest from the right and rem oved 
from the right also, unless two servants 
are in attendance, when one should re- 
move the preceding course from the 
left, while the other places the follow- 
ing course from the right. This rule will be found 
convenient in serving all courses.

Game is usually served from the side table or but- 
ler's pantry, unless the host prefers to show his skill 
in carving. The filled plates are placed in front of 
each guest from the right, and the currant jelly or 
fruit relish, which usually accompanies game, is passed 
to the left. If salad is served with game, which is 
customary, unless it follows with cheese as a separ- 
ate course, it is sometimes prepared by the host, and 
should be passed as soon as game is served. Only 
vegetable salad should be served with game. Meat 
salad should not be served at dinner, and is only ad- 
missible at luncheon, when there are few meat courses. 
If the game plates are very hot, place small, cold 
plates at the left of each cover for the salad, but if the 
salad is served on leaves of lettuce to 
protect it from the heat of the plate, it 
will avoid the necessity of the extra 
plate and is better form. 

Remove this course from the right of 
each cover, one at a time or one in each 
hand. If the small plate is used, take 
up the game plate first, then place the 
salad plate upon it. This is the only 
exception to the general rule never to 
pile plates one on top of the other. 

Serve Burgundy.

All salads are suitable for luncheon, but care 
should be taken, however, not to serve meat too often. 
Only vegetable salads should be served at dinner. If 
a French dressing is used, the host or hostess may pre- 
pare the salad on the table, but at formal dinners it 
is usually made in the butler's pantry, just before 
serving ; a French dressing virill not bear vraiting. A 
vegetable salad is usually served virith game and is 
often followed by a hot cheese course. With a heavy 
dinner the light salad is more desirable, and if there 
is no game, the salad may be served with cheese or 
cheese preparations. This is the English way, how- 
ever, and if the hostess prefers to serve cheese and 
wafers after the dessert, it is 
perfectly proper to do so. Serve 
the salad as you do all of the 
other courses, followed by the 
cheese and pulled bread, or wa- 
fers. Remove this course in the 
same manner you have taken 
the others. In the next section. Eggs and Cheese, 

directions are given for clearing the table.

Eggs or cheese dishes, hot or cold, are often used as 
entrees at luncheons, and eggs are usually served 
as a separate course. A delicious friend of a cream 
cheese is a currant preserve put up in tiny glass jars, 
made in France, and called after the name of the 
place. Bar le Due. These jars are always passed on 
a tray, following the cheese, each guest taking a tea- 
spoonful. Of course this should not be served with 
hot-cheese mixtures, which are sometimes served at 
dinners and luncheons, but the Bar le Due and cream 
cheese are suitable for both dinners and luncheons. 
Pulled bread, toasted wafers, crouton or bread-sticks 
are always served with this course. 

To clear the table for dessert, everything in front of 
each guest, except the glasses, should be removed; 
then take everything else from the table, leaving only 
the nuts and bon-bons, the decorations and illumina- 
tions. If there are any crumbs, take a crumb-scraper 
or napkin and quietly dust every vestige into a plate. 
This is rarely necessary at a formal meal, and should 
be avoided if possible. If it is the informal meal re- 
move platters and large dishes first, then the carving 
or tray napkin, if one be used, fold over from the ends 
and take up carefully, then proceed as for the for- 
mal dinner. Fill goblets with water and pour wine. 

When everything is in readiness bring in the dessert.

This department should include the three following 
sections, as a dish from any one of the three would 
be a sufficient dessert for the ordinary dinner or 
luncheon. At the formal dinner a hot dessert may 
be followed by a frozen cream or ice, but the dinner 
or luncheon is quite long enough with one dessert. 
The cold desserts, which are more acceptable, usually, 
may be accompanied by cakes of the daintiest kind, 
though this is almost superfluous, and it is in quite 
as good taste to leave them out. Dessert at formal 
dinners is either served from the butler's pantry or 
is placed on the table before the hostess, and afterward 
passed. Forks should be used whenever it is possible, 
always with frozen pudding or cream. Dessert plates 
should be small and choice. The proper . fork and 
spoon for dessert should be placed at the right and 
left just before the course is served. When at an in-| 
formal dinner every one has finished, remove the 
platter or dish first, if it has been served by the 
hostess, then remove the plates from the right just 
as you have all the others. If cheese has not been in 
the menu it may now be served 
with wafers. Now serve coflfee 
and place the finger bowls ac- 
cording to directions in Coffees 

and Cordials.

After the dessert is removed serve black coflfee, 
which should be clear and very strong. It may be 
poured on the table by the hostess 
or sent in from the butler's pantry. 
The cups, vphich are very small, 
should only be three-quarters full, 
and should be placed in front of 
each guest. Crystal or lump sugar 
should be passed to the left, accompanied by a tiny 
jug of cream, if cream is served. As the object of 
taking black coffee is to aid digestion, the addition of 
cream is injurious, and, therefore, unnecessary. If the 
hostess pours the coffee, the pot containing it and the 
cups should be placed in front of her on a tray. 

Now place a finger-bowl in front of each guest, 
slightly to the left. They should be arranged and 
placed on the side-table before the meal is announced. 
Use the handsomest small plates you possess. Place a 
dainty doily, smaller than the plate and one that will 
wash, upon each plate, under the finger-bowl, which 
should be half -filled with cold water, adding a geran- 
ium-leaf, slice of lemon, or a flower, if yon like. If 
fruit is to be served it should precede the coffee, and 
a small plate, holding a fruit-knife, should be placed 

229 




THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

in front of each guest. Occasionally cheese, wafers, 
and celery are served instead of fruit. Bonbons 
shoTild be served just before guests leave 
the table. 
At a formal dinner the finger-bowls are 
placed directly after the dessert 
or fruit, after which the ladies 
leave the table, the hostess, of 
course, rising first. Then the cof- 
fee is served to the ladies in the drawing-room ; the 
gentlemen remaining at the table are served at the 
same time. Cigars, liqueurs, and cordials in very 
small decanters are then placed on the table for the 
gentlemen to help themselves. A small decanter, con- 
taining cordial, is brought into the drawing-room on 
a tray, accompanied vrith cordial-glasses and a glass 
dish of finely pounded ice. 

Cordials are alcoholic liquors, usually very 
sweet and of high flavor and delicate per- 
fume. They are always served after black 
coffee in tiny glasses holding scarcely more 
than a tablespoonful. In serving any of the 
cremes, the glasses should be filled with ice 
poiinded very fine, as they are rich and 
heavy, and require dilution. The ordi- 
nary cordial or liqueur is served with- 
out ice. Imported cordials are usual- 
ly served, but the recipes given below 
are a good imitation, quite inexpen- 
sive, and may easily be made at home. The fashion of 
serving coflfee and cordials in the drawing-room is one

All of the following accessories should be served 
with their respective courses, except the salted nuts 
or popcorn, bonbons and olives, celery or radishes. 
The three latter should be removed just before dessert 
is served. A few suggestions about bonbons may be 
of some use to the young housekeeper : Brandied 
cherries dipped in fondant, marrons or fruits glace, 
marrons or fruits deguise, or chocolates, any of these 
in tiny paper cases ; or peppermints or small candies 
filled with liqueurs, are the first choice. If these are 
not obtainable, select cheaper candies with artistic 
coloring, but perfectly fresh. 

A new way of preparing almonds is to brown them 
in a syrup made of 1 c. brown sugar to i c. water, and 
serve them as a bonbon.

" Soon at fiye o'clock 
Please you I'll meet you. " 

— Comedy of Errors. 

" Strong tea and scandal — Bless me how refreshing," 

— School for Scandal. 



The five-o'clock function may be four of your 
dear friends in for a chat and a cosy cup of tea, or 
the four hundred of your set to whom you wisli to 
give social recognition, this taking the place of the 
ceremonial visit, the inviter conveying the idea to the 
invited that she wishes to continue the acquaintance. 
For the small reunion of friends the tea should be 
made and served by the hostess in the drawing-room 
or in any living-room but the dining-room, and in 
country houses out of doors, if possible. For this 
delightful occasion only the simplest and daintiest 
sandwiches and cakes are served, with hot tea, coflfee, 
or chocolate, or in hot weather, iced coffee, tea, or 
punch. No service or assistance is necessary, except 
to bring in the required articles ; the hostess or a 

253 



FIVE O'CLOCK FUNCTIONS 

friend makes the tea or pours the beverage, and the 
guests help each other and themselves. For the 
more pretentious affair, the affair of the four hundred, 
the refreshments should be served in the dining-room. 
A very pretty table may be arranged with flowers 
and lights, a friend of the hostess seated at each end 
of the table to serve tea, coffee, bouillon, or ices. At 
very large entertainments the ices and cakes are 
served in another room, another pretty table and more 
friends being called into requisition. The refresh- 
ments for a large afternoon function, besides the 
drinks already mentioned, should consist of dainty 
plates of small sandwiches, olives, fancy cakes, and 
bonbons, all served from the table by waitresses, or 
young ladies, also friends of the hostess. Napkins 
are not always necessary, though they are a protection 
to the gloves and dresses ; the tiny sandwiches and 
the cakes are usually placed on the saucer or a plate 
under it, and are partaken of sparingly. The servants 
needed for this affair are, one at the door, two in the 
kitchen, one in the butler's pantry, and two or three 
in the dining-room, a maid for each dressing-room, 
and perhaps a man to open the carriage-door. Here 
is another opportunity for the artist in entertaining 
to show her best work. A fastidious arrangement of 
flowers all over the house to ciilminate on the dining- 
room table, all of one color, or a harmonious blending 
of colors, gives a fine opportunity for one's love of 
ornamentation to run riot, but here again is a note of 
warning. The simplest entertainment, when accom- 
panied by a charming hospitality, is better appreciated

" This night he makes a supper and a great one, 
To many lords and ladies." 

— Henkt VIII. 



The evening collation is served late, and custom has 
decreed that this repast should consist of the richest 
and most indigestible of foods ; perhaps that is the 
reason why fashion is turning a cold shoulder to the 
old time evening reception when people were invited 
for social intercourse. Whatever the reason, men 
and women of to-day have declined to accept Noah's 
invitation to come in pairs for no other amusement 
than that of each other's society. Now there must be 
something to do for our nervous, excitement-loving 
generation : the younger ones to dance, the older ones 
to play cards, and the musical, artistic, or pedantic 
are invited to enjoy their own specialties. Our busi- 
,ness, however, is to tell the young housekeeper and 
prospective hostess what to have and how to serve it, 
so we will leave the matter of digestion for the doc- 
tor to settle the next day. The little suppers, where 

255 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

guests may be seated at small tables, are the most 
enjoyable. A menu \fhicli includes hot bouillon, hot. 
entrees, light sandwiches, dainty biscuit, cold entrees, 
and salads with thick dressings, coffee with real 
cream, for those who take it, wine or punch, a frozen 
cream or ice, and light fancy cakes, is quite as mucli 
of a "collation" as anyone should indulge in, and 
very much less of a menu would be in better taste 
perhaps. The small tables should be daintily linened 
and flowered, with, a cover for each person consist- 
ing of the necessary number of forks for the differ- 
ent courses, and a napkin and a glass for ice-water. 
These are all that are required besides the service 
plate, unless game is included in the menu, then a 
small silver knife should be in readiness at the right of 
the cover, and a teaspoon for the coffee, which on this 
occasion may be served with the meats or salad if 
there is no wine or punch. Coffee should be served 
in teacups if served with the supper, or in after- 
dinner cups as a last course. Dainty receptacles for 
sugar and cream should be on the table, as this is 
the only occasion when cream is allowable except at 
breakfast. This is undoubtedly to aid in the indi- 
gestible result of the whole affair. Exquisite little 
•i dishes of glass and silver containing salted nuts, bon- 
bons, and olives may also be placed on the small 
tables, for guests to help themselves. As the ambi- 
tious young housekeeper may be inclined to under- 
take a large and elaborate entertainment, in spite of 
advice to the contrary, the following suggestions may 
not be out of place : 

256 



EVENING COLLATIONS 

The table for a large entertainment should be square 
or oblong, covered with a fine damask cloth over one 
of thick cotton flannel. Flovrers and fruit may be 
used in abundance., only avoid over-crowding. Dishes 
may be decorated and placed on the table from the 
beginning of the entertainment. There should be 
only one of each kind, however, more being supplied 
from the butler's pantry when necessary. Piles of 
plates, with folded napkins between, and forks by 
the side of them, are neatly arranged on the side- 
table, and all hot drinks or dishes are served from 
the butler's pantry. At this function guests may help 
themselves, if they are not seated at small tables, so 
that it is not always necessary to have a large corps 
of waiters for either large or small entertainments. 
Punches or frappes are usually served during the 
entire evening at a side-table from a large glass 
bowl with a silver ladle, into small glass cups made 
for the purpose. This service-table gives an oppor- 
tunity to display ingenuity and originality, as the 
artistic decorations and gastronomic creations show to 
great advantage. Good taste demands a little re- 
straint, however, that the hand of the caterer be not 
too apparent. Remember, the keynote to the success 
of the entertainment is individuality and refinement. 

The following list of dishes are suitable for the 
evening collation, recipes for which can be found in

" Not all on books their criticism waste, 
The genius of a dish some justly taste, 
And eat their way to fame." 

— YODNG. 

The chafing-dish, like the bicycle, has pushed itself 
into the best society, and it is quite evident it has 
come to stay. Many years before it became fashion- 
able it was here as the friend of the Bohemian and im- 
pecunious. It was only a cheap metal affair then, 
seeking its abiding-place in out-of-the-way corners ; 
but now it is resplendent in silver and gold, and en evi- 
dence on the smartest occasion. When it first makes 
its appearance in the menage it is quite as tricky 
as its friend the bicycle, and participates in inflicting 
many an unsavory mess upon unsuspecting victims. 
With a little patience and practice, however, it be- 
comes a dainty accessory to my lady's charms, and 
many a manly heart has grown warm and tender un- 
der its gentle auspices. Nevertheless, to be practical, 
there should be a reason for introducing it into good 
society. As every one of the following recipes can be 

359 



THE HOSTESS OF TO-DAY 

made just as well over any fire, the only excuse for its 
appearance should be a complete knowledge on the 
part of the manipulator of the recipes to be used, all 
accessories in readiness, and a circle of intimate friends 
with appreciative appetites. There are a few things to 
remember : To have the lamp well filled and in good 
working order ; to place the standard of the chafing- 
dish on a tray a little larger than the dish to protect 
the table from fire and boiling water. 

Use the hot-water pan only when the preparation 
requires steaming or stewing, or to keep it from burn- 
ing while waiting for other ingredients or toast. 

To cook quickly, use only the blazer and have it 
hot before you begin. Have a handle on the hot- 
water pan as well as on the blazer. Use a chafing-dish 
spoon which' is of silver or metal, with a wooden or 
ivory handle. Have an extra fork and teaspoon to 
try with, if you are not sure of your seasoning, and 
a small napkin. 

Before beginning to cook see that the table is well 
supplied with knives, forks, and napkins for each 
guest, and that all the ingredients needed are prepared 
and neatly arranged around your tray ; to wait for 
one ingredient sometimes means the ruination of the 
whole dish. Only one's intimates should be bidden to 
share the joys of a chafing-dish, and never more than 
ten at a time. The chafing-dish has not yet been made 
that will appease the appetite of more. 

The chafing-dish came as a fancy, and it is staying 
as a fact — but few fashionable fads have been of so 
much benefit to the world. The desire to become an
