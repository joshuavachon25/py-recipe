no department in life wiiere tlie laws of chemist i\ are so signifi-

not so much what shall we eat. as how shall it be cooked y 

Decide as far as po.ssible the night before what shall consti- 
tute the viands for the following day: by observing this rule 
much time can lie saved. Veasl max be used instead of baking 
powder. Have material for soups on hand. Many desserts can 
be prepared the day before. Proi)er judgment must be exercised, 
or food will not contain "very element of nntriment it otlier- 
wise would, however good the cook book, (rood judgment, in 
this direction can only be aci|uii'ed through exiierience. To

to make these formulas explicit and jiiactical. so that any one

BREAD 



Ik'hind the snowy loaf is the mill wheel, behind the mill is 
the wheat field, on the wheat field rests the sunlifiht, aliove 
the sun is God.— [James Kussell Lowell. 



liRE.VI) M.VKIN(;. 

Unless pains l»e taken in iircad making; il is ;i t'ailurt'. The 
art of making ^(K)(l bread slmuld he niasicrcd by lionsekeepers. 
It dei)ends on good Honr. good yeast, strengtli to knead well and 
eareful baking. Tbe tlonr shonld be old and dry. To test good 
flour, squeeze it between the tliuml) and flnger. it should tlien 
show the jirint of the skin. Too little yeast, or jxHir. tliin yeast 
or too short a time foi- raising will cause heavy bi'ead. It al- 
lowed to stand Too long before kneading it will prol)ably ^oiii-. 
Failure also I'esults from putliiig loo much tlonr in the dougli 
or letting it become cold, stale yeast or xcast which has been 
fi'ozen oi' scalded. I; read should be set wliei'e the temi)erat ure is 
warm and even, iieit lier too liot nor too cold. I'Mour enough to 
knead easily and no moi'e should lie used. If the bai'e ai'in can 
be held in the oven i ndiiute only, it is about rigiit temin'rat ure: 
put in the bread and do not increase the h(>at. i'.ake fi'om .')() to 
<)0 mituites. The loaves should be a light l)idwn color, not burnt 
or whitisii. When baked remove from tlie pans while hot. 
moisten the crust slightly and wi-ap in se\ci-al tliicknesses of 
cloth. When i)erfectly cold put into bread jar. in mixing, put 
in al)out s t he (plant ity of tlour and beat to a stift' batter, then 
add all the tioui- gi-aduall\ . mixing and kneading wit h t he hands.

(tRAHAM (IEMS. 

One cup sweet milk. 2 cups cold water, 1 egg. 4 cups (rrahaMi 
rtoiir. Let all these materials l»e of the freshest and coldest. 
Beat the milk, water and egg thoroughly. A Dover egg heater 
is just the thing to use for this purpose. Sift the flour through 
the Angers lighly into this wetting, stirring all the time. When 
the flour is all stirred in. beat all together well and drop into hot 
iron gem pans. , and bake in hot oven 30 miuntes. When baked 
take out of the gem pans immediately and do not cover. 

Remember that to ensure success, j'our dougli must be cold and 
your oven and pans hot. Do not add saltas it has a tendancy to 
make gems heavy, neither use hard water if soft water is attain- 
able. The l)est gem i)ans are of iron with shallow biscuitshaped 
cups. Fill the cups very full as there is no danger of running 
over, and thegeme-; will be nicer. 

(rood (rraham flour is not coarse, but flne and of a creamy

SOUPS 



To i)ro])are good stock, the meat should ])e fresh and juicy to 
make the best soup. If it is to be eaten as soon as it is prepared 
you should remove all the fat ])ossible from the meat, for. there 
is nothing more disagreeable than greasy sou]). If it is to be 
eaten next day or later, stand the stock in a cool i)lace and re- 
move all the grease from the top the next morning. Beef alone 
vi^ith some vegetal)les will make good soup stock, but many think 
that by adding chicken or veal a finer Havor is imparted: others 
think the addition of a ham Vjone an imjn'ovement. Stock can 
be made from trimmings (»f fresh meat or bones of any 
meat or fowl. Having selected your meat, put it in cold 
water, about -l pints to every pound of meat, and let it simmer 
from one side, taking care to remove all scum that rises. 
Alwaj's keep the kettle covered to retain tiie flavor. Put in a 
little salt at first: and add salt, peppei'. etc.. to suit the taste 
when lU'arly done. It usually takes from :{ to ."> hours to cook 
Ihe meat i)roperly. and make good l)roth or stock: when it has 
cooked say three hours, and the scum has been removed, add 1 
or 2 onions fried brown in butter and 1 or 2 carrots or any 
other vegetaV)les that you may prefer. If moi'e water is needed, 
always add boiling water. Stock that is to l)e kept should al- 
ways be strained into an earthen jar as soon as done, as it injures 
1 he coldi' anil flavor to stand in an iron pot : it sliould lie kvpt in 
a cool plact-: it will form a jelly and keep for a week or more. 
By adding macaroni, vermicelli, etc.. to stock, almost any kind 
of SOU]) can be made. Vrvy tine gravy can be made by cutting 
off a piece of stf)ck jelly and heating, thickening and seasoning 
to taste. Savory herbs sliould always be at hand, as they are 
almost indispi'usable to good cooking. The relish of a dish de- 
pends very much u])(ni its tiavoi'. which can be changed infinitely 
by using different savory herbs. Summer savory, sage, thyme, 
sweet majoram. sweet basil. I'ose mary. bay leaves and fennel 
are among the best of liie savory herbs. They can be ])urchase(l 
at a drug store at a slight cost: but many pi'cl'er to raise many of 
them which can be done with little trouble.

MOILING MEAT. 

There is all the ditference between boiling meat which is to be 
eaten and meat whose juices are to be extracted for soiij). If 
the meat is required as nourishment. yf)u wanttlic juices kept in. 
To do this it is necessary to phiuge it into boiling water, whicli 
will cause the albumen to coagulate suddenly and act as a plug 
or stopijer to all the tubes of the meat, and the nourishment will 
be kept in. The temperature should be kept at the boiling point 
for 5 minutes, then add as much cold water as will reduce the 
temperature to 165 degrees. If the hot water is kept at this 
temperature for some hours, we have all the conditions united 
which will give to the flesh the (juality best adai)ted for its use 
as a food. The juices are kept in the meat, and instead of be- 
ing called upon to consume an insipid mass of indigestable ttbers. 
we have a tender piece of meat, from which, when cut, the im- 
]U"isoned juice runs freely. If the meat l)e allowe;! to remain in 
the boiling water, it becomes in a short time altogether cooi<- 
ed l)at it will be almost indigestable and unpalatable. 

Mks. A'estev. 

TO MOIL A ]IA>r. 
Select a ham with a thin, pliable skin, of a clear brown color: 
put int(» suttlcient cold water to cover, and cook slowly. When 
the me;U begins to draw away fi-om the hones, take olf tiie stove, 
and when pailly cool remove from tlie water. lai<e off tiie skin 
and as niucii of the suf|)liis fat as yon wish, slick - doz. cloves in 
tlie meat and liake in t lie oven from ^ to f of an hour. 

ITEM. 

Tiu' fatty portion of the luiin will lie found lo lie in layers, 
the outside is a greasy fat and t he inner ia\ci- a meaty fat. All 
fat meat left from ham may be tried, and i)y cooking sliced 
potatoes in it, be clarilied for fiying ])urposes.

POTATOES. 

"X(» vegetal)les require more careful cooking ttian tlie potato, 
and none are handled more carelessly. If cooked in their jackets 
and peeled before serving, they are of much ))etter Havor than 
wlien pared before cooking. Old potatoes should be pared if too 
.strong rtavored. put into cold water for one or two hours before 
boiling and put on to cook in cold water. When soft enough to 
admit a fork, turn off the boiling water and return in the kettle 
to the tire three minutes, shaking up vigorously tliree or four 
times, which will make them dry and palatable. If you wish to 
mash them use a wire masher or a three fined fork, break them 
thoroughly while steaming hot: add such seasoning as you like. 
and a plentiful sujiply of rich milk and butter, or cream, stir very 
fast with the wire masher two or three minutes, and they will be 
white and light. Serve immediately, at least do not let them 
stand in the kettle as the steaming makes them watery. New 
potatoes should 1)e i)ut into boiling water and taken out as soon 
as they are done. • Mks. J. L. Muuuay. 

SARATOGA CHIPS. 
Pare and slice raw potatoes very thin, eitlier with a sharp 
knife or a vegetable slicer. I'ut in cold water from ten to 
twenty-four hours to draw oul the starch. Di'ain well, ijut a 
pint in frying basket, plunge into l)oiling lard and cook almost 
ten minutes. Have lard veiy hot when potatoes are first put in. 
When potato(>s are doiic. drain, and place upon old cotton to get 
rid of t he grease, salt slight ly. If one has not a liasket they may 
be (li(ip|i('(l iiild the grease and taken out with a skimmer.

Take out the contents of a pint can of best salmon, removing 
all the bits of skin, bone and tluid. I pick from one disli to an-

For a white sauce, heat a pint of milk in double boiler, thicken 
with 2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in cold milk, add 2 table- 
spoons of butter, salt and pepper. Set this aside to get thor- 
oughly cool. 

Prepare 1 pint tine l)read crumbs, by removing all the crusts, 
and cruml)]ing the V)read which must not be dry, between the 
fingers. Put a thin layer of crumbs on the bottom of pudding 
dish, dot with bits of butter, cover with half the prei)ared fish, 
then half the remain ing crumbs, pour over at this stage half the 
sauce or dressing, add the rest of the fish, then the breadcrumbs, 
then the rest of the sauce. Upon the top scatter a very thin 
layer of very fine crumbs, a mere handful, which may be re- 
sei'ved or prepared extra, pressing into the sauce lightly, with 
bowl of spoon: dot finely with butter and bake very slowly for i 
iiour. To be wholly successful, the oven must V)e so mild that 
no crust will form on bottom or sides of dish, and the top will be 
only slightly tinted. It is then a very delicate dish.

Be very careful not to cf»ok too much. If small, tliey may be 
fried in butter or sweet oil. Have the butter or oil hot and do 
not overdo. Try them with a fork. Put no eggs or batter on 
them, they are better plain. They canbeln-oiled by wra])inng- in 
glazed paper' well buttered, sprinkle a very little pe])])er and salt 
on them, put them on the gridiron, and turn them from side to 
side over the hot coals. Season with lemon juice. If your trout 
weighs a pound or more it is better boiled. Use enough, slight- 
ly salted, cold water to cover the fish, let come slowly to a boil, 
and boil from three to five minutes, turn off the water and if 
you are careful the fish will not break and the beautiful colors 
will be as bright as before cooking. Serve plain or with drawn 
butter sauce. It is delicious if not over cooked.

COFFEE. 



First, buy your coffee ^reen and roast it carefully yourself. 
Use equal parts of Mocha and Java. Mocha coffee is a small 
rounding kernel of a yellowish green color, and Java is a large 
kernel of a brownish color. Grind the browned coffee fine in 
order that you may get the full strength. Use earthen or gran- 
ite ware to make your coffee in. and wash the coffee-pot after 
brewing. Allow a tablespoonful to each person, of the ground 
coffee, wet it with cold water and an egg before putting it in the 
coft"ee-i)Ot, 1 egg is sufficient for 1 cup of ground coffee, if less 
coffee is used, use less egg. Tut the wet coffee in the pot and 
pour boiling water on it, let it boil up once then remove to a 
l)lace on the stove where it will be near the boiling point but not 
l)(iil. let stand from 10 to 15 minutes, serve in hot cups with hot 
cream or milk with yolks of eggs beaten together. 1 yolk to 1 cu]) 
milk. If there is coffee left and you wish to save it, pour it off' 
the grounds, if allowed to stand on the grounds the bitter pois- 
on is extracted, and the coffee is spoiled. If you must use tin to 
make coffee in use bright, new tin. but earthen is far preferable 
to anything else. A. C. F. 

COFFEE. 

One cup coffee, add 1 pt. cold water, set on back of stove A 
hour, when nearly ready to serve V)ring forward anil add Vioiling

taste. Mrs. E. W. Thayeh.

CARAMEL COFFEE. 
Take 1 cup oai'h of wliito flour, corn meal, unsifted (Jrahani

ently thin to take u]) all the flour, i or A cu]) cold water may he 
added. Iriake the cakes m an oven until a very dark hrown, al- 
lowing them to hecome slightly scorched. Use 1 cake to each 
cup of cott'ee. jutur cold water on them and steep 20 minutes.

TEA. 

Tea is made variously as the tastes of people require. Black, 
green, Japan and English hreakfast require different methods. 
For green or Japan tea, scald the tea-pot and allow from one- 
half to one teaspoon for each person, as the strength of the herh 
may indicate. Pour over this * cup of boiling water, steep in 
a hot place, but not boil. 10 minutes then turn in boiling water 
in proportion 1 pt. to every 3 persons. For English bre;ikfast or

TEA AND COFFEE FOR CHILDREN. 

Tea and coffee dietary for children is as had in its effects as its- 
use is universal. Dr. Ferguson found that children so fed only 
grow four pounds per annum between the ages of thirteen and 
sixteen; while those that got milk night and morning grew 
fifteen pounds each year. The deteriorated physiques of tea-and- 
coffee-ted children, as seen in their lessened power to resist dis- 
ease, is notorious among the medical men of factory districts.

HOW TO :make :v[rsii. 

A'ery few ])e()i)lo know lUiW to lunke t liis dish as it should be. 
The ingredients for a dish of niusli. are water, salt and corn 
meal. The water should be soft, tlie salt line, and the meal 
of the first (luality. yellow meal gives the best eolor but white 
meal is more easily cooked. The water should be boiling hot at 
commencement, middle and end of operation. The meal should 
be added very slowly, so as to prevent any lumiis forming, stir- 
ring all the time, and should never be in such (luantities as to 
bring down the temperature of the water below the l)oilingpoint. 
Herein lies the secret of making good mush. ^lush should be 
cooked 2 or .'J hours. ' ]SrRs. Geo. Gtllett.

CREAMS AND ICES. 



RUSSIAN CREAM. 

One qiuut of milk. 1 box of gelatine snaked in a i pint of hot 
water, 4 eggs, 1 cup of sngar. Whip yolks and sugar together. 
Let the milk boil and stir in eggs and sngar, and let cook a little, 
last put in gelatine, and stir well. Let cool partly and stir in 
the wliip])ed whites of eggs, and put into moulds. 

Mrs. W. a. SiJ$i,Kv. 

PINEAPPLE BAYARL\N CREAM. 

One can of pineapple. 1 large cu]) of sugar, cook twenl\ min- 
utes or until soft. Add a teaspoonful of lemon juice and slniii; 
through a coarse sieve. Strain into it immediately i box of gel- 
atine which has been soaking 2 hours in a half cu]) of cold water. 
Stir the mixture until it begins to thicken, then put in one i)in( 
of stiff whipped cream, and when well mixed ])ut in a mouki on 
ice. Serve with whii^ped cream. Mrs. W. A. Sirlev. 

SPANISH CREAM. 

Dissolve i package of Cox's gelatine in i pt. of cold milk, sim-

stirring till perfectly dissolved; add the beaten yolks (tf 8 eggs 
and vanilla, as for custard, and let them scald one minute, or a 
little more: when done pour the mixture into a large bowl con- 
taining the beaten whites of 8 eggs, stir briskly for one minute, 
and pour into moulds. It will flU 2 (its. and 1 i)t. Our experience 
leads us to say, that if milknum's milk and cream is used, it is 
lietter not to soak the gelatine in milk, bul water.

Jellios are best made fntiii t lie bones, leys and tendons of

solid portions are eooked into l)its. then strain otV the liciuor 
through a colander, pressing out all tlie juiee: set tliis liciuor 
away, and when solid, which will l)e the next day, remove all the 
fat you can with a knife, jtour a i)int of boiling water over the 
jelly turning it oif (luickly, and with a cloth ab.sorl) all the 
grease. Cut the sediment from the bottom, place on the stove, 
and when melted strain through a cashmere flannel bag, but do 
not s(iueeze at all. return to the bag and strain the second, per- 
hai)s the third time, and your jelly will he clear, which you can 
flavor as you desire. If you use isinglass, the Russian is the best 
though more expensive. For flavoring jellies it is better to use 
the juice of any kind of fruit except currants which are too acid.

PRESERVES.

—[Holland. 



HINTS AP.OUT MAKING rRESEIlVP]S. 

It is tiol gt'iu'rally known that boiling fruit a long linir. and 
skiiuiiiing it well, without sugar and without a covt'r \i> tlic 
preserve pan is an economical way. because the bulk of the scum 
rises from the fruit, and not from the sugar, if the latter is 
good: and boiling it without a cover, allowing th(> eva])oration of 
all the watery particles, the preserves keep tirm and well flavor- 
ed. The proportions are f lb. of sugar to 1 n». of fruit, .lams 
• made in this way of currants, strawberries, and rasplicii'ics ai'e 
excellent. 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR F()l{ 1*RESERVIN(;. 

To each pound of sugar allow- i \)t. of water, for every ;J llis. of 
of sugar, the white of 1 (^ga. ^lix when cold. V)oil a few minutes, 
and skim it. let it stand ten minutes, skim it again and strain 
it. 

IMJESERVEl) PEACH P:S. 

Dress tlic pcaclirs. cut in lialves and add f lb. sugar to eacli 
pound of fruit, let stand 4 or '> iiours in lialt tlic sugar, pour off 
the juice into llic i)i-csci-\ing kettle witb tiie remainder of tlu^ 
sugar, and wlicn scalding lioi add tlic peaches and lioil !.■> 
or 20 minutes, or until I hey look clear. It is better to kee]) 
them in glass. A few luach pits added improve the flavor. 

JELLY OF ("HAI'.AIM'LES. 

To each H. lbs. crab ai)pl(s. 1 pi. watci-. boil gently until they 
are broken. Four tlie whole into a jelly l)ag. and when the juice 
is quite trans])ai'ent weigh it and put it into a preserving pan 
Boil gently Kl minutes, remoxc Irom the tire and poui' into il lo 
oz. of fine sugai- to each pound of juice. Roil gently from 12 to 
15 minutes, skimming it clear, and jjour into moulds. Should 
the quantity be large, boil a few minutes longer before adding 
the sugar.
