E have gathered into this book a few items which we 
believe lovers of art ceramics and those who entertain 
will consider worth perusing and possible preserving for 
future reference, and in offering it to our friends we take advan- 
tage of the opportunity to express our thanks for the sub- 
stantial appreciation which our efforts to please have always 
met at their hands. We have been the pioneers in the importa- 
tion and introduction of many lines of fine goods, which others 
thought would not be appreciated in a comparatively new country 
like the Southwest, but we have found in every case that we did 
not err in our judgment of your taste. In ceramics, as well as in 
men, true merit is not always discerned at first glance it is in 
constant association for many years that worth counts and it is 
gratifying to know that those who allowed themselves to be 
guided by our experience have been more than satisfied with the 
results. 

Over a quarter of a century of study of these wares 
has qualified us to advise, and in the light of past ex- 
perience we feel justified in saying that those in need 
of China, Glassware, Pottery or Ornaments will find 
it to their advantage to consult us before making their 
purchases in these lines. 

Very Respectfully, 

Parmelee-Pohrmann Co. 





FOREWORD 






ERVICE at table demands absolutely spotless linen, care- 

fully laundered and plainly folded. There are of course 
fashions in linen as in other things but the laws governing 
them are sufficiently flexible to accomodate themselves to 
the purse of people of moderate means. Do not place the 
table cloth on the bare wooden top; lay first a covering of 
Asbestos made for this purpose. It deadens the sound and 
gives the linen a firm, and better appearance. 

Do not starch either table cloth or napkins, they must 
fall in soft smooth folds from the edge of the table. 

Knives and forks to be handsome must be of medium 
size, and if the purse permits, have a set for each course. 
It is also necessary to have two, better three, carving sets, 
two large and one small. The large one will be used for 
roasts and turkey; the second size for fowls; the smallest for 
steaks and birds. 

We have in these days many special pieces of silver, 
dainty and convenient, as butter forks, cheese-knives, as- 
paragus tongs, cake knives, pie and ice cream spoons, cold 
meat forks, jelly spoons, et cetera. 

It is generally acknowledged that we are showing the 
largest assortment of popular patterns in plated ware to be 
found in the Southwest. 

We also are showing the latest patterns in Sterling 
Silver. The designs are extremely rich and deep, both in the 
French gray and bright finish. 




TABLB* SBRMCEr' 




'T^HE following very complete de- 
scription of the correct use of China 
and Glass for Breakfast, Luncheon, 
Dinner and Tea is from a booklet on 
the subject by an Eastern authority, 
and is reproduced here for the benefit 
of those to whom a little authentic ad- 
vice on the subject may be acceptable. Before taking up the 
arrangement of the tables for the different meals we would 
like to say that the first thing to be considered in equipping 
your China Closet is the question of where to buy. So 
many nondescript wares, possessing no degree of artistic 
merit, are offered for sale in every city, that the purchaser 
is beset with many difficulties in making his selections. 
To obviate these he should patronize an establishment that 
has absorbed generations of ceramic knowledge, whose 
managers personally conduct its foreign purchases and 
have acquired by long years of experience the ability to dis- 
cern at a glance what is and what is not true art in 
ceramics. In this article the aim has been to give such 
information as will intelligently guide the purchaser in 
selecting a complete table service of China and Glass- 
information obtained by years of practical study and much 
travel in those countries where Ceramic Art is dignified by the 
same rank accorded music, sculpture and painting and justly so, 
for is it not an association of the latter two? 




BREAKFAST 



'Y4$-P C 'T/ 

i^W*.. ^ 



"Small cheer and great welcome 
makes a merry feast."^ _ n _ 

VHE breakfast table should be bright and cheerful, 

with a beautiful china breakfast service in strong 
colors of blue, pink, green or brown, with gold treat- 
ment, which need not entail a great expense. Those 
who have tried the experiment of using an appropriate 
breakfast set will bear witness that it is a great mistake 
to think that "anything will do for breakfast." In many 
cases the family is brought together at only the morning 
and evening meals, and it is therefore important that the 
day should be inaugurated in a pleasant manner. The set 
selected should be bright, fresh and dainty. With many 
people the "Indian Tree" or Japan Bombay is very popu- 
lar, with its inviting blue and red effect. The following con- 
stitutes the complete breakfast service, portions of which 
are, of course, used only at proper seasons of the year: 

Fruit Sets, consisting of a fruit dish or basket and 
individual plates. The plates may or may not be of the 
same design as the fruit dish, though the colors of both 
should harmonize. 

Porridge Sets, consisting of porridge dish and smaller 
individual saucers may be of blue underglazed effects or 
broad floral or geometrical designs. 

Breakfast Cups and Saucers should be of medium 
size, and as they are usually part of the uniform set, 
should be of the same color. 

The Individual Breakfast Plates should be seven and 
one-half inches in diameter. 

The Chop Tray or Round Platter, forming part of the set, 
which should be ten or twelve inches in diameter, according to the 
number of persons at the table, is of a very graceful shape, and its 




BREAKFAST 




N 






size permits greater scope in decorating than is possible 
with many articles in the service. 

The Gravy or Well Dish is an oval or square shaped 
platter for steaks. It is called a "well dish" because in 
one end there is an indentation or "well" into which the 
gravy is drained through several grooves leading from 
the center of the dish. It is a very practical idea, in 
that it is more convenient to serve the gravy from the well. 

The Cassarole or Covered Round Dish gets its name 
from the Italian word "casserola," meaning stew-pan 
or sauce-pan. It is used for chopped beef, creamed 
potatoes, codfish and cream and other articles of food 
which should be kept warm while on the table. 

Open Vegetable Dishes are made in round, oval 
or square shapes and of various sizes. 

Egg Cups are of two shapes, both of which are shown 
in beautiful designs. One kind holds the egg so that it 
may be eaten from the shell, and the other is larger with 
a stand, and is used by those who prefer to break their 
eggs into a cup. 

Toast Racks are used properly only at the morn- 
ing meal. All lovers of dry toast appreciate these be- 
cause there is no other way that the toast can be served 
in such perfection as with the toast rack, which keeps 
the pieces separated and preserves their brittleness. 
Those made of hard metal heavily plated with silver 
have been most practical. 

Wheat Cake Sets consist of a covered muffin dish, 
individual plates, syrup jug, lemon tray and powdered 
sugar bowl, all of which harmonize in their decorations. 
Roll Trays are shown in various pretty designs. Their proper 
use is suggested by the name. 

The Covered Butter dish may be an odd piece either of china 
or of glass. 





Bread and Butter Plates form a practical addition to 
the breakfast set. 

In Coffee Pots the advantages of China or Earthenware 
vessels over metal are well known, and even if the taste were 
not affected their perfect cleanliness should commend their 
use. 

Cocoa Pots may he" had in all sizes for the table and in- 
dividual service, beautifully decorated in flowers or rich 
solid tones with heavy gold treatment. Being odd pieces 
they may also be highly decorative. 

Sugar and Cream Sets and Spoon Trays are made in 
scores of beautiful and quaint shapes of exquisite colors 
and designs. They vie in beauty with the other decorative 
pieces of the breakfast set. 

Water Jugs are of earthenware, china or glass, and 
may be a feature of the set. Those of china are treated 
in figures and colors and those of earthenware display 
novel coloring effects in magnificent relief modeling. 

The Water Carafe idea is of French origin as the name in- 
dicates. They are beautiful pieces of glass, mostly in rich 
cuttings, though some are prettily etched. 

Appollinaris Glasses are fairly large, beautifully light and very 
transparent, and straight_in shape. 

Mineral Water Glasses differ from Appollinaris 
Water glasses only in size, being smaller. 

Table Tumblers, shown hi rich cuttings, also in 
fluted, etched and plain styles, should be large enough 
to hold crushed ice. 

Finger bowls are seen in gilded and enameled glass 
or in rich cut glass. They should be placed on the table 
at the end of each repast as well as after fruit and other 
articles of food which require the touch of one's fingers. 
Ice Tubs for crushed ice are usually of china or 
cut glass. They may be used with or without stands. 





LUNCHEON 

\<Mi 

5E 





T UNCHEON being usually a light repast, principally of 
cold or hot bouillon, cold meats, chops, steaks or other 
meats, salad and vegetables of one or two kinds, it follows 
that the character of the china should be daintier than that 
used for breakfast or dinner. There are to be seen many beau- 
tiful and delicate tints. 

The following is a complete list of the china and glassware 
used at luncheon: 



Bouillon Cups

^THR DINNER TABLE; 





, 



"That all-softening, overpowering knell, 
The tocsin of the soul the dinner bell." 



AT dinner, the principal event of the daily 
routine of home life, all the members of 
the family gather about the board with ap- 
petites stimulated by the day's exertions, and greater prepara- 
1 tions are made than for any other repast. It is therefore fitting 
that there should be a generous welcome for each member of the 
family as well as for guests. 

Beautiful flowers make the most appropriate decorations on 
the ground work of immaculate linen and under the soft rays of 
the candelabra or banquet lamps; and all of these have an influence 
and significance. There is an unspeakable purity in the linen's 
whiteness, and glorious cheer in the mellow light and a balm in the 
blossom's fragrance. The flowers may be arranged in a center 
group of beautiful vases, a cluster of roses or other flowers in a 
single vase, or growing ferns in fern stands may be used. For 
formal dinners a single bud or boutonriiere in a flower tube is 
placed at each service plate. 

After the arrangement of the flower decorations comes the 
placing of the napkins, cutlery, silver and glass according to the 
courses and wines to be served. The wines should be graded up 
from the mild to the better vintages as the dinner progresses, until 
the game and roast courses are reached, when the wines should be 
of the highest grade. 

The following is a list of the indispensable and necessary pieces 
of china and glass for correct dinner service, together with those 
pieces solely employed for decorative effects. They are given 
in the order in which they are placed on the table during dinner.

Having briefly outlined the requirements in the way of china 
and glass used in the correct service of dinner, \ve will now go a 
little deeper into details, as there are many minor points on which 
the reader may still desire information. 

In considering the decoration of the table there are hardly 
any separate articles which alone add such a wealth of brilliancy 
and comfort to the dinner as the artistic electric lamp, or the candel- 
abra. Their soft light on china and linen combines with the floral 
pieces in adding lustre to the occasion. 




DINNBTL 



i The flower vases, tubes and fern stands 

may be of various sizes and shapes in rich deep 
cuttings, simple chaste patterns, or plain crystal 
blown, as well as in rich gold effects of crystal 
or colored glass. It is well to select vases either 
low or very tall, so that they do not obstruct the 
view across the table. 

The service or place plates are purely dec- 
orative, and should be in strong colors and rich gold effects. They 
often bear a distinct design. 

Since the Americans serve bread and butter at every meal, 
the bread and butter plates should not be omitted. People who 
think they are out of fashion are misinformed. On these plates 
one has ample space for both bread and butter. Their convenience 
commends them to permanent use. In decoration they may match 
the roast set, or be of a color harmonizing with all the china, pre- 
ferably in white and gold. 

Olives, radishes and celery are most palatable when served 
cold, consequently the dish for each should be deep enough to hold 
sufficient cracked ice to bed them in. The mistake of serving celery 
in high glass stands is sometimes made, but when served in this way 
it soon wilts and loses its flavor. It should properly be served 
in a tray for that purpose, which, being an odd piece, may be a 
decorative feature of the table. 

Individual Celery Dips for salt are smaller than an ordinary 
salt, and especially adapted to individual use. 

The silver, sterling always preferred, should be neatly de- 
signed. Unplated, steel blade knives, kept sharp, should be used 
for all meats and game. Those with pearl handles are durable and 
in good taste. A special fish knife and fork are made for the fish 
course. The carving knife should always have a keen edge if the 
good nature of the carver is to be preserved. 




DINN 




In can-ing poultry or game a . very practical 
addition to the carving set is the poultry shears, 
for severing joints, etc. They are made of the best 
nickel steel, nickel-plated, are shaped especially for 
the purpose, and their use prevents the dulling or 
nicking of the carving knife on the bones of the fowl. 

The water goblets and wine-glasses for the different courses 
from oysters to dessert should be placed on the table with the 
silver and the napkins. 

The oyster course needs no lengthy comment by reason of 
its simplicity. Oysters and clams should always be served in 
their natural shells, otherwise much of the flavor is lost. There 
are new deep oyster plates in which to imbed shell oysters in 
crushed ice. They are preferable to the plates heretofore made 
for the serving of oysters. The proper wines to serve with the 
oyster course are white wines, either White Bordeaux, White 
Burgundies, Moselle, or Rhine Wines. 

Following the oyster course at American dinners, although 
some famous diners and epicures hold that this order should be 
reversed, comes the soup course. The kind of soup one should 
serve depends on the sumptuousness of the courses that follow it. 
When the dinner courses are light a thick soup should be served 
in goodly portions, but in heavy course dinners a clear soup 
is preferable and should be served in smaller portions. The proper 
way to serve hot or cold bouillon or chicken broth is in a two-han- 
dled cup with saucer, the cup being about the size of an ordinary 
tea cup. Soup plates of the old rim shape are proper for all 
kinds of soups, but some prefer a coupe shape (without the hori- 
zontal rim), and for cream soups two-handled, low-shaped bowls 
with plates are used. The Soup Tureen is an important piece 
and maybe highly decorated. Tureens are made in various shapes 
and sizes. 

Cracker Jars for the oyster or small biscuit are odd pieces, of 
different shapes with wide mouths. Where salted wafers are pre- 



DINNBR 




ferred, very handsome trays may be obtained for them. 
Whichever dish is used should harmonize with the articles of 
the dinner china. With the soup course is served the Sherry 
or Madeira wines. 

The fish set, which next comes into use consists of a 
large fish dish, a sauce boat and individual plates, all usu- 
ally elaborately decorated with scenes from fishdom deftly 
executed. 

When scollop oysters or fish are served, ramekins 
should be used. They are of fire proof china and the scol- 
lop may be baked in them. They are made with saucers 
to match, and are very practical and satisfactory. Choice 
Rhine Wines are properly served with the fish course, they 
being considered by wine authorities as essentially fish wines. 
The entree set consists of individual plates and a round 
dish suitable for serving breaded chops, fricassee of 
chicken, sweetbreads, calves' brains or whatever else the 
entree may be. The individual plates should harmonize in color 
and design with the dish. Red Bordeaux wines may be prop- 
erly served with this course. 

Next follows the roast or heavy course, for which there is a 
special set consisting of a large sized platter, two covered vege- 
table dishes, a gravy tureen and plates to match. The roast course 
is the main feature of the dinner and the china for it should be more 
elaborately decorated than that used for the other courses. A 
very effective dinner service is that in which the decorations of the 
china increase in color and design with the progress of the dinner 
from oysters to roast, the roast set being a fitting climax to the 
preceeding sets in richness of design. The appropriate wines for 
this course are dry Champagnes or rich Red wines, such as Bor- 
deaux, sparkling Burgundies or Clarets, and the glasses used should 
be the most exquisite obtainable. 



i 




DINNER 




When game or fowl follows the roast 
the colors of the service may be as strong as 
those of the roast set, but naturally of a dif- 
ferent character. The game dish and plates 
comprising this set are capable of the finest' decorations on 
china. They usually bear paintings of birds or hunting 
scenes by high-glass artists, no two pieces having the same 
picture. When partridge, quail, chicken or turkey are 
served, Champagnes are proper, and rich Red wines should 
go with Canvas-backs, Mallard and Teal ducks, Wild Boar, 
or Roebuck. 

If cold asparagus is served before the salad, White 
Bordeaux wines may go with it. The set for asparagus con- 
sists of a platter with a drainer, a boat for dressing and 
individual compartment platter, all beautifully decorated 
in rich colors. 

The salad should be served after the roast or game 
courses, but it may be served with roast or fowl when the 
asparagus is r:ot made a separate course. It should be 
dressed at the t ble and never until guests are ready to be 
served, as the lettuce loses its brittleness and becomes less palat- 
able if allowed to remain in the vinegar and oil. The salad may 
be served from a cut glass bowl, or fine porcelain bowl modeled 
for the purpose. Besides the bowl the set consists of individual 
salad plates, mayonnaise bowl, and vinegar and oil cruets of cut 
glass, and servers of ivory, silver or wood. 

On occasions where there are to be toasts and speech-making 
the Champagne is often served with the dessert instead of during the 
roast course. 

For the pudding course, a special dish, sauce boat and in- 
dividual plates are necessary. The pudding dish has been very 
much improved in recent years and is now made with a separate 
fireproof lining in which the baking may be done, in consequence 
of which the dish itself may be beautifully decorated, and run no 
risk of being cracked or stained by the heat of the oven. Rame- 




DINNER 



kins, which are now to be had in the finest dec- 
orations with little plates to match, are often 
used for individual puddings as well as for scol- 
loped oysters, sweetbreads, etc. 

After this course the china and glass are removed, leaving only 
champagne glasses, floral decorations and candelabra or lamp. 

The ice cream set, consisting of a tray, individual plates and 
cake plates may show pleasing contrasts in gold and color. 

Cake plates are very necessaiy adjuncts to the proper serving 
of ice cream. They should blend fittingly with the ice cream set. 

The cheese course is served with a set consisting of a cheese 
dish, individual plates, and cabarets, the latter having three or 
four compartments for radishes, lettuce, celery, water cress or young 
onions. Some kinds of cheese need to be kept moist and should be 
dispensed from a wedge-shaped or round glass stand with a cover, 
made for the purpose. Brie, Camembert, and other like cheese are 
served from a small plate. The custom of serving with the 
cheese, lettuce, radishes, and other vegetables of the same family 
in cabarets, which is popular in England, might well be adopted in 
America, for the combinations of the flavors is quite palatable. 
Dessert knives with silver blades should be used with the course. 

The proper service for the fruit course consists of footed fruit 
comports and footed dishes with plates to match, decorated in rich 
tones in flowers or fruit effects or embellished in encrusted gold. 
Silver dessert knives are to be used with the dessert course. 

The Cafe Noir course is served w r ith a special set consisting of 
a coffee maker or coffee pot, cups, saucers, sugar bowl, and spoon 
tray. Cups of moderate size, admitting of fantastic decorations 
in high colors are most satisfactory. Cognac of fine flavor is fre- 
quently mixed in small portions with the coffee, after the French 
custom. 

The last course is usually a light indulgence in either Liqueurs, 
cordials or Creme de Menthe. At weddings, banquets or state 
dinners, punch is dispensed. 




DINNER, 



*K,sZZ\i 




After this the ladies withdraw, leaving the gen- 
tlemen to enjoy their cigars. Candlesticks and ash 
trays, the later of various shapes and decorations, 
should be placed before each smoker. 

In concluding the description of the correct ser- 
vice of the dinner, a few words in relation to the 
glassware are necessary. For water, goblets, and not tumblers, 
are proper. Tumblers may be used at breakfast and luncheon, 
but the handsome and convenient goblet should be in evidence at 
dinner. American dinners are now usually prefaced with a cock- 
tail, and glasses for this are to be had plain, fancy gilt, or richly cut. 
Saute me, which is served with the oyster course, should be dis- 
pensed from a handless decanter heavily cut or engraved, and the 
glasses used are either with green bowls and crystal stems, or with 
gilt decorations. The decanter for Madeira is finely cut, has no 
handle, and is about the size of those used for claret. The glasses 
are in cut crystal or treated with gold. 

Sherry decanters and glasses are seen in a variety of graceful 
shapes. The popular glass for sherry is the taper shape, slightly 
flared at the top. For Rhine wine, decanter and glasses are shown 
in various colors and the stems and bowls are of quaint shapes, 
sometimes cut and sometimes richly gilded. It is one of the laws 
of the Medes and Persians that the finer the quality of the wines 
the finer and richer the glass in which it is served. Sherbert Cups 
are to be seen in a great variety of decorations in Bohemian gilt, 
and crystal cut effects. 

Although there are pitchers made for serving champagne it 
is most effectively served from the original bottle to the especially 
designed glasses which have a saucer-shaped bowl. Burgundy 
glasses are qf a capacity between those of sherry and claret, and are 
in cut crystal or richly decorated. In serving port wine no colored 
glasses are ever used, the proper glasses being simple crystal or 
adorned with gold. The decanter for this wine is smaller than that 




DINNER 



for claret, and has no handle. Claret decanters 
are beautifully handled and with brilliant lapidary 
stoppers. With this wine, as well as with port, 
colored glasses are not proper, the correct ones being 
either of a dainty goblet shape or with a round 
shaped bowl of simple crystal. Although it is customary 
for the French to drink their claret, much diluted with water, 
from goblets, the best claret should not be diluted. It is only 
ordinary table claret that is treated in this manner. Cognac is 
served in a very small plain or simple cut-glass of special de- 
sign, and from a small handless 'decanter. A special glass is 
made for Creme 'de Menthe, which is properly served in glasses 
filled with shave'd ice. The Creme de Menthe 'decanter is of a 
small size without handle and may be of plain or colored glass 
highly decorated. 

For Liqueurs and cordials the decanter may be fancy-shaped 
but small, in rich cut effects, or in showy gold treatments on 
plain or colored glass. The glasses are small and of numerous 
beautiful designs. They are used for Benedictine, Chartreuse, 
Annisette, Kummel, etc. 

Punch bowls are to be seen in both cut and gilded glass 

and china of rich designs and ornamentation, and the glasses 

are in a variety of fine decorations of crystal and Bohemian 

gilded effects. Iced tea glasses are thin and tall and may be either 

straight or bell-top, holding about a pint, including ice. 

Flemish beer steins are displayed in a great variety as to size, 
color and decoration, and holding from one half pint to a quart. 
They make very attractive dining room ornaments at all times, 
as do also the beer tankards, which are handsome earthen vessels 
sometimes fully thirty inches in height. Beer and ale tumblers 
are light and perfectly straight, those intended for ale being the 
smaller of the two. There are also in use many kinds of mugs made 
of odd Faience, decorated wood, pewter and cut glass. In ale 
jugs many unique and pretty designs are shown. They are small 
and generally of the tankard shape.

A WINE service from our most complete line of 
** Cut Glass enhances the beauty of the table dec- 
oration and also makes the most pleasing setting for 
the wine itself. 

The most important consideration in the serving 
of wines is to see that they are exactly the right tem- 
perature when they come to the table. 

The different wines generally in use should be 
served at the following temperatures: Champagne, 
35; Dry White Wines, Rhines, Moselles or Sauternes, 
45; Sherry, 50; Port, Madeira, Claret or Burgundy 
should be brought into the room where they are to 
be served an hour previous to serving, that they may 
acquire the temperature of the room itself. 

Where it is desired to serve wine with every course 
at a dinner, the most acceptable arrangement of the 
wine is to serve Sauterne with the oysters, Sherry 
with the Soup, Rhine, Moselle, or Dry White Wine 
with fish, Champagne with the Roast, Claret with the 
entree, Burgundy with the game, Port or Madeira with 
the Cheese or Nuts, Brandy or Cognac with the 
Coffee, while the cordial is served last of all. Should 
a less elaborate service of wines be desired, it is per- 
fectly proper to serve Sherry with the soup, Rhine 
wines with the fish, Champagne with the Roast, and 
Brandy with the Coffee. 

A still less formal service consists of Sherry with 
the Soup, Claret with the Roast, and Brandy with the 
Coffee. In a simple dinner where only one wine is 
used, it should be served with the roast of fowl. 







TN Colonial days, when gas and electricity were nu- 
known the candlestick was a necessity, while today 
odd as it may seem, it is a luxury. From a daily need 
to a daily use it has taken its place in the twentieth cen- 
tury as a very pretty bit of home decoration. 

There is, of course, a reason for all this, the reason 
that the soft glow of the candle is incomparable ; it suggests as can 
no other artificial light, atmosphere of peace and ease and comfort, 
and beautiful shades have increased the charm of the candle 
light's natural mellowness quite materially. 

As you know, candles and shades have come very much into 
fashion of late and for decorating the little touch of color they give, 
has made them decidedly popular. 

Simply the price alone sort of tempts one to buy, but should 
you ever start to speculate, where in this room, or that, a candle- 
stick with its candle and shade could be effectively used, you would 
be lost; we are confident you would find the temptation too hard to 
resist. 

Take the Drawing Room for example, when strong lights are 
not needed, what could you find to better set off the beauty of a 
handsome mantel than a pair of quaintly designed candlesticks and 
soft toned shades, or what can you imagine would make a prettier 
ornament for a fine center-table? 

Then in bed-room, boudoir or dressing room what could better 
give an atmosphere of refinement or repose? 

Take the dining room, where it is said, "If a woman has any 
talent it will out on her table." Is there anything, absolutely 
anything, in the way of table decoration you can think of 
that adds so effective a touch. There is an irresistable charm 
the candle-light throws over pure damask or dull polished 
mahogany a charm that transforms and goes forward, inspiring 
hostess and guests gathered around the festive board with that 
delightful spirit of jolity and good cheer. 




O'CLOCK 
TEA 



TX serving refreshments at home at a late Luncheon or 
after the Theatre, a Five O'clock Tea Kettle will be 
found a necessary adjunct to the Chafing Dish in preparing 
a hasty Luncheon. 

The requisites for a Five O'clock Tea Table are the 
brass, copper or silver Tea Kettle, the Tea Pot and Tea 
Ball, Sugar Bowl and Cream Pitcher, Cups and Saucers of 
odd shapes and designs, Small Plates, Cake Plates 
Rum Decanter, Lemon Tray, Spoon Tray and Bon- 
bonniere or Candy Dish. 

For ornamentation, a delicate vase of flowers, or 
a rose bowl and candlesticks of dainty patterns are 
always appropriate.

CHAFING DISH 



}^ i! Y T^HE use of the chafing dish is said to date from 
<1^5v the time of Homer, but never has it been so 
popular or in such general use as at the present day. 
Its popularity is well deserved, however, for those 
who have used it in regular housekeeping, in 
bachelor apartments, in the artists' quarters in 
modern Bohemia, in the house-boat, or in the 
camp, have found it a very useful article either for a 
regular meal or for an impromptu dish in an emergency. 

A complete chafing dish consists of a stand and lamp, 
dish proper, cutlet dish, and hot water pan, and is most 
frequently of brass or copper, nickel-plated; or of German 
silver with a silver plating. When wood alcohol is used, 
fuel is not an expensive item, as it is said that a pint is more 
than sufficient for ten receipts. 

Any light breakfast or luncheon can be prepared on a 
chafing dish, using another spirit lamp for coffee or tea, and 
for late supper for a few, no other way of preparing them is as 
practicable. An entree at dinner may also be attractively served 
in a chafing dish, and any ordinary cooking done in a saucepan on 
the range can be done in one of these. Chops and steaks can be 
daintily done by using a scant amount of butter, and chicken, 
trout, frogs legs, crab, chops, liver and bacon can be done equally 
well. 

For a quick meal on a chafing dish nothing equals one of the 
many preparations of eggs, boiled, poached, fried with bacon, 
scrambled or in one of the many omelettes. Most receipts for the 
chafing dish are best served on fresh toasted bread or crackers. 

Care should be taken to prevent scratching the dish with a 
metal spoon. A wooden one is better. 

We append a few receipes gathered from various competent 
authorities:

SILVERWARE? 




'TpABLE Silver in Sets or separate pieces is al- 
* ways appreciated by the housewife. 

We carry an exceptionally fine assortment in- 
cluding the best productions of Reed & Barton, 
Oneida Community, Rogers Bros. (1847), all of 
whom have a national reputation for quality of 
wares and elegance of designs. 

For weddings, silverware is essential, noth- 
ing is more appropriate or more appreciated. 
Next to the ring itself, it dominates all other gifts. 
It becomes the heirloom of the family. 

CLEANING SILVERWARE 

keep the bright service of silverware free 
from scratches eternal vigilance is necessary. 
Even the fine soft chamois should be kept care- 
fully away from the dust and never used on any- 
thing but the silver. There are many polishing 
powders and silver cleaning compounds on sale, 
the use of which will destroy the bright surface. It is economy 
in the end to consult a silversmith or a dealer in silver who un- 
derstands the care of his wares when purchasing a polishing outfit. 
"Argentala Polish" prepared by Reed & Barton, the well known 
silversmiths of New York is one of the most satisfactory com- 
pounds for this purpose in the market as it produces a brilliant 
polish and is not injurious to the surface. 




PAINTBD 



l*^> 



'TpHERE is scarcely a home of the better 
class without some pieces of hand 
painted china; many families would as soon 
think of being without solid silver spoons. Homes other- 
wise tasteful and elegant sometimes lack color. A few 
touches of color, a beautiful hand painted tankard on the 
buffet, a brilliant vase on the mantel, a few choice pieces 
on the plate rail or the stein rack, these lend color and 
add warmth and life to the home. They go far toward 
making the home beautiful. These pieces will be found 
in the Pickard Hand Painted China. 

A selection of Picard China is one of the most satisfying gifts. 
It is a permanent and always pleasing remembrance. Its intrinsic 
worth makes it a prized gift and its artistic excellence renders it a 
mark of taste and discernment on the part of the giver. It is an 
ideal wedding, birthday and holiday present.

CUT GLASS 






A RTICLES of Cut Glass should be thoroughly 
washed with luke warm soapsuds, using a 
stiff brush in order to reach into all the cuts. 
Then rinse in warm water, hot water is apt to crack 
the glass, and set in box of clean pine sawdust, rubbing 
the sawdust well into the glass. 

After the moisture has been absorbed and the article 
is prefectly dry, brush out the sawdust with a soft brush 
and polish the glass with tissue paper, slightly moistening 
the paper with alcohol, which will heighten the brilliancy 
of the glass.

/CONSIDERABLE care must be exercised in the cleaning 
V^i 

of china on which gilt forms a portion or all of the 

decoration. Strong soaps, soap powder and other washing 
compounds should never be used, and only a minimum 
amount of home made or pure old fashioned soap i.s allow- 
able if any, is used at all. In fact, for the finest pieces it is 
better to use none at all, which is quite possible if the water 
is moderately hot and the china is washed and dried quickly. 
The gilt on china which has been washed without soap 
will last for years and will always be as bright as new.
