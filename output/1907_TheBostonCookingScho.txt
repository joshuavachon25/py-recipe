Google 



This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing tliis resource, we liave taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 
We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain fivm automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attributionTht GoogXt "watermark" you see on each file is essential for in forming people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liabili^ can be quite severe.

Old Time Arts and Crafts 

By Mary H. Northend 



THE arts and crafts movement 
which is so rapidly gaining 
favor with the American peo- 
ple is not, as might be generally sup- 
posed, a modem-day innovation. It 
came into vogue hundreds of years ago, 
under no particular name, it being a 
necesfflty rather than a fad. 

High up in a grimy old building, 
which stands a prominent feature in 
one of our Eastern towns, is carried on 
a co-operative handicraft partnership. 
Originally, this was under the super- 
vision of the Arts and Crafts Society in 



Boston; but, after fostering it for a 
length of time, it was left to be operated 
by three steady work-women, whose 
aim was true craftsmanship and a de- 
velopment of individual character in 
connection with artistic work. 

An American woman is the designer, 
two Finlanders doing the work, while 
at times one finds here a young French- 
man, a wood-carver, who makes ex- 
quisite bits in copper and silver. 

Down in Ipswich, Mass., the art of 
pillow lace is still going on, reviving the 
industry of long years ago. In Scituate 



The Boston Cooking- School Magazine 



dainty picture frames are made, the 
creations of the wizard artist, Watson- 
Da wson. 

Marblehead, the quaint old town, 
noted since early days, has on her shore 
a sanatorium along the arts and crafts 
line. Here nerves are successfully 
treated with work, all of which is but 
a resurrection of an old-time industry. 

Deer field was the spot where this 
work commenced. It was done by 
an organization known as the Society 
in Blue and White Embroidery. They 
taught the old stitches, and used thread 
dyed by a Deerfield inhabitant. 

Let those who have given little 
thought to the subject go back to the 
early days of our country's settlement, 
to the time when our emigrant ances- 
tors, noted housekeepers, plied indus- 
triously the needle and wheel, while 



they looked well to the comforts of 
their households. Specimens of their 
handicraft are carefully treasured to- 
day in the homes of their descend- 
ants, — bits of the old-time industry 
which hold their own by the side of 
the twentieth-century work. 

In imagination we can enter the 
ample kitchen of the log cabin that 
formed the first home of the colonists. 
It was the centre of family life. Here, 
gathered around the cheery blaze, we 
find the household, each one busy with 
his evening task. On the settle placed 
in the most sheltered nook sits the 
revered grandame, busilv plying her 
needles, the long sock of home-made 
wool growing rapidlv under her skilful 
hands. With her foot she gently rocks 
the cradle in which the youngest mem- 
ber of the household lies sleeping. 



Old Time Arts and Crafts 



Around her knee are gathered the little 
ones, who with upturned faces listen 
eagerly to the stories of her childhood 
home, far away in the mother land, 
across the sea. 

Neatly clad in linsey-woolsey gown 
and petticoat of blue, the busy good- 
wife glances approvingly at her little 
flock as she steps lightly back and 
forth, attending to the great wheel. 
The roar of the flames as they dance 
merrily up the chimney throat, prac- 
tically drown the continuous buzz. 
The whir of the flax-wheel harmoni- 
ously hums in unison with the great 
wheel. This is tended by the older 
daughters, who are busy at work, pre- 
paring a stock of linen against their 
wedding day. In preparation for the 
morrow's weaving, the youngsters fit- 
fully rattle the quill wheel as they fill 
the quills for their mother's use. 

Not like to-day are the rooms lighted 
with gas, electricity, or lamps. The 
red light from pine knots, heaped high 



on the glowing fire, throw fantastic 
shadows on dusky walls and closed_ 
shutters. This is a domestic picture 
of the early days when our forefathers 
sought a new land for freedom of re- 
ligious thought. 

Old-time arts and crafts included 
practically all that is manufactured 
at the present day. They comprised 
lace-work, bead-work, embroidery, qiult- 
ing, and rug-making. Each of the 
thrifty New England housekeepers had 
her own particular design for quilts, 
lace, and rugs. These she treasured, 
and they have been handed down 
through successive generations, and 
some of them are still to be found in 
modem homes, used in the arts and 
crafts movement to-day. 

In the manidacture of these articles 
an infinite amount of time and patience 
were required, for machinery had not 
then come into use, so that clothes must 
be homespun, sheets must be woven 
and edging wrought by hand. Calico

and prints were not common during 
the &-st century of our country's ex- 
istence, and pieces left over from dresses 
were much sought after, to help out 
the making of a quilt. The patterns 
were most intricate, and named accord- 
ing to design. There was the "Rising 
Sun," the "Log Cabin," and the "Rose 
of Sharon." One of these quilts still 
treasured in a Salem home is an inter- 
esting old-time production. It was the 
result of a wager between five colonial 
daughters as to who, starting quilts 
the same day, could have hers finished 
first, this one winning the prize. It 
contains 1,152 pieces, each star shaded 
in coloring, and was finished when the 
maker was but fifteen years old. 

Quilting parties constituted one of 
the sources of enjoyment, when our 
country was sparsely settled, and it 
meant a general jollification. The in- 
vitations were sent out often weeks 
beforehand, and its coming off was talked 
of during the long Sunday noonings. 

Everybody from far and near was 
invited to attend the "bee," and you 



may be very sure that few stayed at 
home. Days before the great event the 
old brick oven was brought into requisi- 
tion, and filled to its utmost capacity. 
There were brown bread and beans, 
turkey and hams, squash, mince pies, 
and doughnuts. 

A dozen workers surrounded the 
frame on which a quilt was stretched, 
and, while the needles flew busily, the 
gossip of the day was frequently dis- 
cussed. When the quilts were finished, 
supper was announced, afterwards a 
good time was participated in by all. 
Pompey brought out the fiddle, and to 
sound of its twang old and young joined 
in the Virginia reel, and swung their 
partners with a vigor not to be found 
in the dance of to-day. 

The art of pillow lace was brought 
over from England about 1 790. It 
was begun in Ipswich, where it seemed 
to be a local industry, rising to such 
importance that 4,200 yards of home- 
made lace were wrought in a year. 
For a while this industry died out 
through the innovation of machinery- 
made patterns, but within the last few 
years the fad has revived, and old pil- 
lows relegated to attics have been 
brought forth to do duty again under 
the guidance of the grand-daughters of 
the original owners. Bits of lace made 
in 1763 are still in existence, and are 
said by connoisseurs to excel the finest 
lace of to-day. The pillows on which 
it was made differed from those of 
to-day in that, while the modem are 
square, the old-time are round. They 
were constructed of home-made hnen, 
into which was carefully placed suffi- 
cient hay or bran to give them the 
proper size. In the stuffing the work 
had to be carefully done, that the pat- 
terns of lace might be evenly made. 
There was placed over the first coat 
one of thinner material, elastic in cov- 
ering, while around this was carefully 
laid the parchment, which had been 
cut out of skins by a person who made 
a specialty of this branch of work. 



Old Time Arts and Crafts 



In addition to the cutting of the skins 
to the proper width, she pricked on 
them the patterns to be used. The 
pillow was generally about eighteen 
inches across, although the width of 
the lace governed the size. The vel- 
lum, or parchment, was fastened to 
the centre, and accurately pinned to 
the comers. Pricking had to be done 
with great care lest the design be in- 
jured. 

Elaborate patterns on parchment 
were often colored by the workers 
through a mixture of saffron and gum 
arable, which gave to it a yellow tint. 
This was a great saving to evesight 
when a difficult pattern was in- 
volved. 

The lace fell, when completed, into 
a small bag, which depended at one 
side. The pins used in the work were 
generally imported, as was the thread. 
They had to be of a particular kind of 
steel, very long and sharp. Stuck se- 
curely into the pillow, they held the 
lace firmly in place during the process 
of manufacture. The beginner in this 
branch of arts and crafts was first 
taught the simple chain edging. Later 
on she took up the "fan," "hen's comb," 
"double ten," and, becoming more ex- 
pert, worked out the bull's eye and cat- 
face patterns, — ^fine and delicate in 
their texture. Experts in this particu- 
lar branch of arts and crafts have been 
known to make patterns that required 
the use of one hundred bobbins. . 

Many a romance has been woven into 
a bit of bead-work as the delicate fingers 
of the worker flew in and out, mastering 
a new pattern and forming a bead 
watch chain for her lover. These were 
wrought on an oblong frame of wood, 
by winding the woof in and out of the 
warp, producing dainty clusters of roses 
and other equally attractive decorative 
designs. Bead bags were a popular 
ornament for the fairer sex, more es- 
pecially when the dainty garment 
allowed no place for a pocket. — a neces- 
sary adjunct. Many of these bags or 



pockets were semi-oval in shape and 
elaborate in design. The ground-work 
was varied, some being made with a 
dark background, which showed off 
the light-colored figures to great ad- 
vantage: others had a light back- 
ground, which made an appropriate 
setting for the figures wrought of castles, 
animals, and oft-times initials. 

Long and narrow purses had a slit 
in the middle, and rings on either side 
were used to slip over the purse and 
keep the money in place. They were 
caught together with a steel chain to 
be worn over the arm, crocheted of 
silk made especially for this purpose. 
The beads were carefully strung be- 
forehand according to rule, as a varia- 
tion of even one bead made an irre- 
trievable error in pattern. 

The merchant princes, in the days 
of Salem's commercial prosperity, at 



Colonial Surroundings help the Revival of 
Lacc-making 



The Boston Cooking- School Mi^zine 



the time when the stately minuet was 
in favor, wore ruffled shirts deep in 
rich embroidery, these ruffles falling 
over their shapely hands. 

The modern arts and crafts move- 
ment, which is engrossing the attention 
of the present-day generation, is in 
truth but a revival of the industries 
of our forebears, — a necessity, in the 



early times, when stores were few and 
machinery practically unknown, to-day 
a fad, beneficial in its teachings. 

Most New England women have in- 
herited the deftness of finger of their 
colonial ancestors, and the organiza- 
tions of the twentieth century give 
them many interesting and beautiful 
things to do.

And life is naught but happi

The Servant Question in Holland 

By Miriam Dexter 



HOLLAND is clean, and service 
is cheap, but the path of the 
housewife is not entirely with- 
out difficulties. The careless maid and 
the impertinent maid, the maid who 
breaks dishes, and the maid who leaves 
on half an hour's notice are npt im- 
known, however diligent, faithful, and 
neat they may be as a class. *' Privi- 
leges" are different from those in the 
United States. The Sunday dinner is 
never put in the middle of the day, 
and it is only after this meal, at five 
or half -past, that the maid is- free for 
her "Sunday out," but she is at Uberty 
to go to church at half -past nine in the 
morning, if she desires. Her weekly 
"afternoon out" is rather short, for 
in pne-maid famiUes she is expected 
to be at home in time to get dinner. 
On the other hand, most maids have a 
vacation of two weeks in summer, and 
they receive at Christmas a present 
equal to not less than a tenth of their 
yearly pay. Also they are allowed an 
unlimited amount of evening visiting 
and of friends in the kitchen. 

A yoimg girl who can do plain work, 
and cooking and cleaning under direc- 
tion, can be had for forty to fifty dollars 
a year. A good second maid or "gen- 
eral" in a small family, who does not 
need to be taught by her mistress, ex- 
pects three florins ($1.20) a week. A 
good plain cook, who can order the 
meals and is wilUng to do a large amount 
of cleaning and general housework be- 
sides, can be had for eighty dollars a 
year, and for a hundred to a hundred 
and twenty-five dollars one gets a 
"cook-housekeeper" for a big estab- 
lishment, one who directs the other 
servants, supervises the Unen, does the 
ordering, and attends to much of the 
practical work besides. There is a sys- 
tem of intelligence offices, but they are 
not very reliable, and advertising is 



more common than with us. Engage- 
ments are often made and "notice 
given" weeks or even months in ad- 
vance, so that one may see the follow- 
ing advertisement appearing in August : 

"23 Kaiserstraat. Mevrouw Van 
Loon will require, after November i, 
a cook, willing, also, to do some general 
housework." 

The maids look very neat in their 
black and white or blue and white 
dresses. Black dresses are rare even 
in families where .several servants are 
kept. Caps, however, are always worn, 
immaculate affairs of plaited blond, 
and, as in France, these caps are con- 
sidered sufficient head covering for the 
street. Dutch maids are sent out on 
frequent errands, so much time is saved 
by their not having to make any change 
of costume. The aprons are large, and 
have a second pair of strings some inches 
below the waist. This arrangement 
keeps the apron snugly about the 
figtu'e, and also affords a loop through 
which the girl pulls her skirts up out 
of the dust. 

Gas is delightfully cheap, and in the 
towns that simpUfies the cooking, es- 
pecially where two of the meals of the 
day are light. Heating is a great prob- 
lem. Furnaces are well-nigh unknown. 
Gas and kerosene are used to some 
extent, and in the living-rooms are huge 
stoves burning coal or coke. The halls 
are left cold, and the bedrooms are but 
sHghtly warmed. 

In the summer there is no ice, and 
so no ice-chest is to be taken care of, 
but the food has to be kept down cellar, 
and that mean a great deal of running 
up and down stairs. However, in hot 
weather, — and it is never as hot as it is 
with us, — ever)rthing is bought in small 
quantities and used immediately. The 
Dutch kitchen has no store-closet, 
pantry, or cupboard for kettles. All 



lO 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



the utensils are kept in plain sight, and 
the dry groceries, such as tea, coffee, 
rice, and sugar, are kept in the dining- 
room, under the eye, sometimes under 
the key, of the mistress. No bread is 
ever baked in the house, so there is no 
need of a flour barrel. At one side of 
the kitchen there are a few shelves with 
plates and serving dishes, and aroimd 
the stove, above the sink, and all along 
the walls hang saucepans, spoons, 
kettles, pots, etc., all ready at hand, 
and all shining brightly. In every 
household there are a nimiber of large 
copper utensils, and various small 
pieces, which add much to the ap- 
pearance of the kitchen and much to 
the work of the week. Silver is not 
seen often in the simpler houses. Brass 
and copper may be said to be the na- 
tional metals. Milk is carried about 
the streets in great cans that glitter 
like gold in the sun. In every house 
there are candlesticks with elaborate 
snuffers and snuffer-trays, inkstands, 
coffee-pots, porringers, tea-kettles of 
all sizes, pails, basins, tongs for the 
tea-stove, turf pots, and coal-scuttles. 
No wonder that at least one afternoon 
a week must be devoted to keeping 
them up to the proper standard, which 
is that a pocket handkerchief rubbed 
hard against them will not show the 
slightest trace of soil. 

Besides the baking, the maid is en- 
tirely relieved from the washing. In 
all but the very poorest families the 
whole wash is sent every week to a big 
laundry. It is returned ironed or 
rough dry, as desired, generally the 
latter, as ironing is not considered^hard 
work. The straight pieces are put 
through the mangle. The maid do^s 
ordinary linen, and usually the daugh- 
ters of the family take charge of their 
own blouses and fine articles. The 
sorting, marking, and counting of the 
wash, when sent and when returned, 
is work that the housekeeper looks to 
herself, and she also helps to fold and 
prepare the linen for the mangle. 



The first duty of a servant in this 
very clean land is to scrub, and much 
time and many appliances are allowed 
for the purpose. The one maid in an 
average family has nothing to do for 
breakfast beyond boiling some water 
and setting the table. The mistress 
makes the tea, and, when the meal, 
which almost invariably consists of 
bread and butter with jam, honey, or 
** honey-cake," is over, she washes the 
silver and china on the table, while 
Keetje, or Gretje, is free to begin on 
the bedrooms, with no kitchen work 
to delay her and no cooking dishes to 
be washed. Doing the rooms is no 
small affair. About half an hour is al- 
lowed for each one, besides the hour or 
two of every morning when all Hol- 
land seems to resound with the beat- 
ing of rugs. The floors, bare or cov- 
ered with linoleum, are wiped and 
rubbed by the maid on her knees, the 
rugs are thoroughly cleaned, all the 
woodwork and the walls are gone over 
with cloths kept for the purpose, and 
the glass is dusted. The making of 
the bed is a less serious task. The care 
of the washstand is a fine art. For 
the bowl, pitcher, carafe, etc., the maid 
receives each week five spotless red 
and white plaid cloths, of different sizes 
and patterns, which she must keep 
separate and keep clean, and return at 
the end of the week, when they are 
sent to the laundry with the rest of 
the linen. The staircase is treated like 
the floors, and then Gretje dresses for 
the work of scrubbing the hall, the steps, 
and the sidewalk by putting on her 
wooden shoes and tuddng her skirts 
well up. She scatters fine white sand 
on the stone floor of the hall, and with 
a stiff brush works her way slowly 
along, inch by inch. The haUs, never 
very large, are often paved with marble, 
and the effect of this, scrubbed to a 
dazzling whiteness, is really magnificent. 
She then attends to the steps and the 
sidewalk. One pailful of water after 
another is poured over the latter, and 



Sunshine and Shadow

the scrubbing-brush is replaced by a 
stiff broom. The efforts of the Holland 
housewives to keep their sidewalks 
cleaii are not always seconded by the 
Holland public. Most of the market- 
ing is done from dog-wagons at the 
front door (there is no back door in 
block houses), and vegetables, fruit, 
meat, and fish are weighed out on 
the very doorstep. Many a leaf, stalk, 
and fragment of decaying, fruit mark 
the path of the wagons, besides the un- 
avoidable dirt of the wheels. 

The cleaning over, luncheon, or 
** coffee-drinking, "is to be considered. 
This is another simple meal of coffee 
(and Dutch coffee is delicious) or choc- 
olate, bread and butter, cold meat, or 
cheese, fruit, or jam. In some families 
there is one hot dish. After the meal 
the mistress may again wash the dishes 
or she may leave them to the maid. 
In either case they are well washed 
and well rinsed, and rubbed dry instead 
of being drained. 

Dutch ladies . dislike cooking, and 
spend very little time in the kitchen. 
So the maid prepares the dinner, the 



chief meal of the day, with an occasional 
suggestion from her mistress. It usu- 
ally consists of soup, meat, two vege- 
tables, and a plain pudding or cake, 
and everything is well flavored. The 
maid serves it carefully and neatly and 
changes the plates, but no other table 
service is required of her. As a rule, 
she eats her dinner while the family 
are eating theirs, and then hastens to 
get her kitchen tidy again. An hour 
or so after dinner tea is served in the 
parlor, but for this she has only to 
boil the water and fill the milk pitcher. 
Of course, she has her own cup of tea 
at the same time. There are no people 
so fond of tea as the Dutch, and they 
drink it very strong. Sometimes a 
friend from a neighboring kitchen 
comes in to have it with her, and some- 
times she runs in next door for an hour 
or two. Or, if it is summer, she sits 
on her door-steps and looks at the 
garden. In winter she remains in the 
kitchen with her feet on her beloved 
Uttle foot-stove, to keep them off the 
cold floor. There is nothing more to 
be done until to-morrow morning. 



Sunshine and Shadow 

By Kate Matson Post 



There are two cottages side by side 

In a village that I know, 
On their smooth green lawns long shadows lie, 

And yellow buttercups grow. 

Though the same dark nights and golden days 

Sadden and gladden each one, 
One seems to gather the passing gloom 

And one to bask in the sun. 

For the door of one is always shut, 
And the curtains closely drawn; 

No one within cares that buttercups 
Besprinkle the smooth green lawn. 



The other has windows opened wide 

For the sunshine and the air, 
Like a heart that's ever welcoming 

Whatever is bright and fair. 

For our hearts and homes are much alike. 
We may make them what we will . 

We may darken both with hate and gloom 
Or both with God's sunshine fill. 

Both rain and sunshine are close at hand. 
Both gloom and gladness are near; 

But, when hearths are bright and hearts are 
kind. 
There's naught from the gloom to fear. 



The Valley de la Haute Gourmandise 

By Helen Campbell 



NEVER was valley more truly 
named, nor does it deny its 
other title, ''La Vallfe des 
Gourmands et Gourmets/' for, though 
the two words are often used inter- 
changeably, the gourmand stands for a 
grosser feeder than the goiumet, who 
tastes delicately, and is epicure rather 
than glutton. It is a valley of the 
fairest in a land where all is fair, the 
high valley of Valromey in the moun- 
tains of Ain in France, every foot of it 
under highest cultivation. About the 
vineyards are bands of flax and hemp, 
but, for the most part, it is a vast or- 
chard of choicest fruits, cared for as 
thoroughly as any green-house, the gar- 
dens of small proprietors, planted with 
vegetables equally choice, being another 
feature in the landscape. Beyond are 
forests as well ordered, and green fields 
where sleek cattle graze, and provide 
the butter and cream that are as fa- 
mous as all the other products which 
the population demand. 

It is here that Brillat-Savarin had 
his country home, bringing to his neigh- 
bors the final seal on their own satis- 
faction, since the greatest writer of 
France on culinary matters, authpr of 
the treatise oh **The Physiology of 
Taste," had chosen to become one with 
them, and ate certain local yet famous 
dishes with unfailing zest and satis- 
faction. 

**He has eaten them, and now the 
world will know them," the old gour- 
mets said. - '*Ah! it is much to have 
dishes that are of national fame, and 
that will be even more so. Are there 
also dishes of fame, national dishes, in 
your America? We have not heard." 
The American to whom the question 
was put met the small, twinkhng eyes 
of the old gourmet who waited reply. 
In all the dishes of America Brillat- 
Savarin in his travels there had found 



nothing worthy of minute record but 
the wild turkey on which he had dined 
in Virginia, and he had recorded of the 
singular country and its cuisine, **A 
hundred religions, and only one gravy ! " 

How, then, should the Ainerican speak 
of fish-balls or baked beans, the only 
national dishes which at the moment 
occurred to him? Succotash came to 
mind, but that had been borrowed from 
the Indians. Even pumpkin pie itself 
was evolved from the pumpkins which 
they also provided for the experimental 
Ptuitan matron who dared to produce 
the immortal combination. But there 
certainly were distinctive things that 
every American traveler abroad sighed 
for, witness Mark' Twain and his Ust, in 
*A Tramp Abroad," of all the things 
he proposed to order when once more 
his wandering feet touched his native 
soil. Yet in the whole long list there 
was hardly one item really recognized 
as a legitimate part of a civilized menu. 
Gumbo, for instance, closely akin to 
the Italian minestra, or thick soup, is 
almost never seen outside its natural 
boundary, the Far South. 

**If one comes over here to eat bouil- 
lebaisse, and tries in vain to reproduce 
it at home, wriy should not these brag- 
garts come over to eat gumbo?" the 
American thought, as he shook his 
head mournfully ; for at this time there 
had been no bouillebaisse, the dish that 
Thackeray celebrates in his ballad : — 

"This Bouillebaisse a noble dish is, — 

A sort of soup or broth or brew, 
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes, 

That Greenwich never could outdo. 
Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron, 

Soles, onions, garlic, roach, and dace, 
All these jrou eat at Terre's tavern 

In that one dish of Bouillebaisse. 

"Indeed, a rich and savory stew 'tis; 
And true philosophers, methinks. 
Who love all sorts of natural beauties, 
Should love good victuals and good drinks. 



The Valley de la Haute Gourmandise 



13 



And Cordelier or Benedictine 
Might, gladly sure, his lot embrace, 

Nor find a fast-day too aflSicting 
Which served him up a BotiiUebai^se." 

The American sought to translate the 
ballad, but the old gourmet held up his 
hands in dismay. 

"For sailors, for people on the sea- 
board," he said, "but for us who have 
traditions, never! It is of a common- 
ness." 

It was now that there rose before the 
American, sitting silent on the stone 
bench tmder the great plane-tree by 
the fotmtain, a memory of last days 
on shipboard on the home voyage, 
each man with his declaration of what 
the first meal on shore should include; 
but neither on shipboard nor at any 
spot in America, where easy casual talk 
or narration goes on, could he recall the 
same sort of interest and enthusiasm 
that marks the Frenchman on his na- 
tive soil, above all in this singular little 
community, whose central point is the 
ch&teau of Brillat-Savarin rising among 
the trees almost at the entrance of the 
valley, its two little white towers and 
its slate roof visible from all points. 

Here was a little world of advocates, 
magistrates, vine-growers, and owners 
of estates, where every ancient tradi- 
tion was perpetuated, and receipts for 
famous dishes were handed down from 
father to son, one alone sufficing to 
make the reputation of the table that 
ofFered it. 

"It is true," said the old gourmet. 
"There is probably nowhere else on 
earth where a whole people know so 
well what it is to truly breakfast, to 
dine, to sup." 

"But, my friend," the American said, 
"what do you take it that the rest of 
the world does?" 

"You nourish yourselves. That is 
different." 

"And when we drink?" 

"You quench a thirst or you excite 
yourselves, but drinking is quite an- 
other thing. That is a fine art: it re- 



quires self-possession, even meditation. 
Shall a glass of oiu* vintages be tossed 
down the throat with a recklessness? 
Never. It is drop by drop as it were. 
So with a famous plat. One eats care- 
fully, with solemnity even, since here is 
the garnered, exquisite knowledge of 
generations. Do you know what our 
people said, when the question came of 
a railroad to pass through our cherished 
valley? They said. No, no. We live 
well enough. We have abundance of 
everything and very cheaply. Why 
should a railroad disttu'b us, and carry 
to Paris, to disseminate through the 
whole of France, oiu* trout, oiu* par- 
tridges, our shrimps, and all the rest? 
No, no. We wish it not. But they did 
not listen, and behold it is as we knew." 

The old goiu-met sighed. 

"To-day we have learned the cost of 
.being forced to dispute in the Paris 
Halles a choice fish or a string of 
larks. However, we dine still in spite 
of politics, which also have crept in and 
spoil digestion. But in spite of this 
we dine still I And each year the great- 
nephew of Brillat-Savarin, his heir, re- 
ceives at breakfast every friend, no in- 
vitation sent out. The bust of his 
ancestor presides over the repast: We 
drink the wine of which he was proud, 
and are served with the traditional p&t^, 
named from the beautiful Madame 
Aurore R^amier, 'the ear of the beau- 
tiful Aurore.* But there are other p&t£s 
as famous. Think of one called 'the 
chapeau of Monseigneiu* Gabriel Cor- 
tois de Quinsey,' which is of game, 
and made by a rule that is sacredly 
secret. One never forgets, who once 
has tasted this deUght, and there is 
also another, all of birds, 'the toque 
of the President Adolphe Clerc' Also 
there are other dishes. There is a cake 
of the white Uvers of capons bathed in 
a sauce of shrimps' tails ; there is the 
jugged hare of Diana de Chateau- 
morand ; there are otu* truffles blanched 
d la crhne. There are many memories. 
Monsieur, I have seen gentlemen of

distinction. I recall one in public office, 
who, crowned with roses a salmi of 
wonder, a salmi of woodcock. And 
there was another, a man of distinction, 
also. I myself have seen him take on 
his plate a whole woodcock with a 
glass of burgundy, and cover his head 



with a 'white napkin, that not one deli- 
cious odor from wine or bird be lost. 
Those were gourmets, indeed ! For the 
rest of the world, there are dinners, it 
is true, but elegance of decoration hides 
incredible gastronomic errors. Is it not 
true also for America?" 



Emily Dickinson ias Cook and Poetess 

By Helen Knight Wyman 



"If I can stop one heart from breaking, 

I shall not live in vain; 
If I can ease one life the aching, 

Or cool one pain, 
Or help one fainting robin 

Unto his nest again, 

I shall not live in vain." 

SO sang the Amherst recluse and 
poetess. We think of her as all 
soul and voice; but, as Mr. 
Higginson relates, at their first personal 
interview she said to him that *'she 
made all their bread because her father 
liked only hers; then saying shyly, 
'And people must have pudding!' — 
this very timidly and suggestively, as 
if they were meteors or comets." 

In a favorite cookery-book belonging 
to my mother (an own aunt of Emily 
Dickinson) are many leaves added to 
the quaint pages of the original book, 
pubUshed in 1831. On these were 
copied, or pinned in, recipes given by 
relatives and friends, and proved and 
tried and found good. 

Among these are two from Amherst 
that I trust will prove interesting to 
readers of this magazine, proving that 
she was not altogether 

"A creature all too bright and good 
For human nature's daily food!" 

The following is for a corn-cake, 
being copied by my youngest aunt, 
but signed *' Emily Dickinson." It is 
followed by another, given by a New 



York aunt, and the words are added, 
*'Both are delicious." 

Emily Dickinson's Corn-cakh. 

Wheat flour, two tablespoonfuls. 

Brown sugar, two tablespoonfuls. 

Cream(or melted butter), four tablespoonfuls. 

Salt. 

Eggs, one. 

Milk, one-half pint. 

Indian meal, to make a thick batter. 

On another page is a recipe for rice- 
cake as follows. Rice-cake was con- 
sidered our very best ** company cake" 
in my childhood, being carefully placed 
in a large tin pail, and only used when 
outside persons came to tea. The rule 
was much richer than this, however, 
and it was baked in sheets, very thin, 
and cut into squares after coming 
from the oven. Mace (or nutmeg) was 
the spice always used in it. 

EmUtY Dickinson's Ricb-cakb. 

One cup of ground rice. 

One cup of powdered sugar . 

Two eggs. 

One-half a cup of butter. 

One spoonful of milk with a very little soda 

Flavor to suit. 

Cousin Emily, 

In reading the published letters of 
Miss Dickinson, written to her brother 
when a law student at Harvard College, 
or those to intimate friends, we see 
that her tastes really took a domestic 
turn. Even though her mind might 



Kmily Dickinson as Cook and Poetess 



»S 



be occupied with **all mysteries and all 
knowledge/' including meteors and 
comets, her hands were often busy in 
most humble household ways. 

She was truly original, always some- 
what shy and retiring in disposition. 
This trait grew more and more con- 
spicuous, so that she gradually with- 
drew entirely from public gaze. For the 
last year or more of her Uf e she remained 
secluded in her father's house, though 
heretofore her deUght was to roam 
the old-fashioned garden. It was her 
main resource, next to her books and 
her own mystic thoughts. 

She loved flowers with passion, either 
wild or cultivated, as can be easily seen 
from her poems and published letters. 
Birds were her comrades, or, one might 
say, the pretty "models" who ** posed" 
for her. The sky gave her exquisite 
pleasure, as well as the hills. She 
adored the tints of sunrise or sunset, 
and loved every varying mood of Nature. 

Books were to her loving friends. 
She once wrote Mr. Higginson (as he 
says in an article in the Atlantic Monthly 
of October, 1891), in speaking of her 
father, "He buys me many books, but 
begs me not to read them because he 
fears they joggle the mind!" He need not 
have feared, when her confessed favor- 
ites were: "for poets, Keats and Mr. 
and Mrs. Browning; for prose, Mr. 
Ruskin, Sir Thomas Browne, and the 
Revelations." After recovering the use 
of her eyes, which had been delicate, she 
writes that "she read Shakespere, and 
thought to herself, *^Why is any other 
book necessary ?' " 

It was a frequent custom of hers to 
send thanks, for any little favor or atten- 
tion received, in the form of a tiny poem. 

Two such I have always cherished; 
that were sent to my mother while she 
was receiving treatment for her eyes 
from a Boston oculist. 

I am unable to recall my seeing her 
at that time, although as a little girl 
I do remember her on various visits to 
Amherst. She was a good many years 



older, — a young l^dy when I was a 
mere child. But I recall the soft, 
"tawny" hair (somewhat like the soft 
ears of an Irish setter dog), as it was 
dressed similarly to that of Mrs. Brown- 
ing in the pictures we often see of that 
famous woman. One of her pets was 
a dog named Carlo, of whom she writes 
Mr. Higginson: "I think Carlo would 
please you. He is dumb and brave." 
She complains that men and women 
"talk of hallowed things, aloud, and 
embarrass my dog!" 

In the front of my old house grew 
an immense wistaria, with its fragrant, 
purple clusters. Some of these my 
mother sent to my cousin, and this was 
her acknowledgment, written in her 
quaint handwriting: — 

"The beautiful flowers embarrass me, 
They make me regret I am not a Bee!" 

And at another time, for some favor, 
this little poem (never before published) 
was the sweet response : — 

"The Robin, for the crumbs, 
Returns no syllable; 
But long records the' Lady's name 
In silver chronicle ! " 

Her poem^ abound in sweetest verses 
about the birds. It seems as if she 
felt a kinship with them, so frail and 
"elusive," sprite-like almost was she, 
her soul ever poised for flight into a 
world less material than this. 

In reading them, I am impressed with 
her real genius, her genuine originality 
of conception and expression. And, 
in again perusing her letters collected 
by her friends, Mr. Higginson and Mrs. 
Mabel Loomis Todd, I sighed that I 
never had opportunity to gain access 
to that shy and beautiful soul. Her 
friends were few and choice, and we were 
parted, both by years and space, from 
each other. 

But Over Yonder, "where we shall 
see as we are seen and know as we are 
known," there will be time for many 
things ! 



Social Bribes 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



THOUGH polite society and 
worthy people alike rebel at 
the thought of accepting Li ibes, 
yet both, more or less unconsciously, 
help along such practice under its eu- 
phonious names. In public life we call 
bribes graft, in private intercourse they 
go by the business term of fees, and 
in home life they have the pleasanter 
name of rewards. But they all spring 
from the same source, — the allowing of 
special privileges by the grantor to the 
grantee, who wants to get there first. 

Instead of entering upon the work of 
trying at once to reform public life, in 
which we of course begin with the no- 
tion that others are at fault rather than 
ourselves, would it not be as well to 
start with reforming ourselves as pa- 
rents? Our children bother us, and, 
to keep them still, we bribe them with 
candies or pennies. The bribes, small 
when children are little, grow big as 
they find it pays to make larger de- 
mands upon us, to insure their obedi- 
ence. So the germ of graft has been 
started, which in later life may reach 
full development, while the immediate 
harm lies in the weakening of the child's 
will power to do what is right just be- 
cause it is right. Not that any parent 
wants to overwhelm his Uttle girl with 
weary maxims about the eternal 
ought. Yet, because he need never 
allude to them is no reason why he 
should overlay a child's dawning sense 
of right with the idea that he is never 
going to do anything he does not want 
to do unless he is paid for so doing. 

Because we will neither give bribes 
nor delude ourselves with the fancy 
that, when given, they were offered 
merely as' rewards, it does not follow 
that we cannot give present? most of 
the time, only we will not do so just 
after our big boy or girl has been es- 
pecially good, lest it be considered as 



a reward. Giving to one's children, 
even if they take it for granted we ought 
to do so, is such a pleasure that it is 
a' pity to instil the idea of a kind of un- 
spoken moral bargain into the free-will 
gift of love. 

Yet it well may be asked if these 
nursery bribes and adult rewards do 
not pave the way for fees. In England, 
this year, there has been much discus- 
sion concerning them, not fees alone, 
but discounts, blank invoices, secret 
commissions, considerations. From the 
secrecy involved concerning these 
various forms of bribes, wrong-doing 
is inferred. Hence the English '* Pre- 
vention of Corruption Bill." Though 
it is safer, it is less exciting to hear of 
other wrong-doings than those of our 
own countrymen, so that we still may 
congratulate ourselves that, however 
bad things are **down town," house- 
keepers up town, in this country, are 
not approached with offers for ''con- 
siderations" in their marketing, or that, 
if they are, such offers usually are in- 
dignantly refused. 

What bothers housekeepers is the un- 
certain basis of fees or no fees in pri- 
vate houses. Some hostesses expect 
them to be given, others do not. Some 
guests give a big fee for a trifling ser- 
vice rendered or a short visit made. 
Others expect much attendance upon 
themselves, stay a long time, and give 
nothing. The secfond visit of such a 
guest is often a household disaster. 
Because of fees, it is a current remark 
that it costs more to visit than to go 
to a respectable but not fashionable 
hotel. Perhaps no more embarrassing 
question is ever put to a hostess than 
when a kind guest, who always wants 
to do the right thing, but seldom 
succeeds, asks her whether or not she 
shall fee her maids. On the other 
hand, the kindly tact of some guests 



Social Bribes 



17 



leads them to send Christmas gifts to 
those who have waited upon them 
during their visit. Though there never 
can be any stringent legislation about 
the granting or abolishing of fees, 
guests, at least, can remember that they 
have no right to exact that for which 
they return no equivalent, not even 
that of good manners. 

As for tips at restaurants and on 
sleeping cars, it has become a matter 
of self-protection to pay them, and in 
those cases where wages are openly 
low, because employers expect their 
employees to be feed, it is but fair **to 
give them a lift.*' Yet one may be 
pardoned for his annoyance, if he sees 
his neighbor, who has put out a dollar 
bill, better served than himself, who 
gave but a quarter. This having to do 
a Uttle more than one can afford, in 
order to get something, is the aggrava- 
tion about fees. Yet we do not want 
to cheat the railroad porter. 

Far more difficult to adjust than the 
matter of fees, and more difficult to 
withstand than the bribe of the secret 
commission, is the bribe of social polite- 
ness. You are invited to lunch or 
dinner. You know it was for a pur- 
pose, and yet it is not poUte to assume 
that you are not valued for your own 
sake alone. The giving of dinners and 
luncheons, the sending of flowers and 
bon-bons, are often just ways of getting 
round people so as to get something 
out of them. Still, one cannot resent 
what apparently is offered in cordial 
good will, lest she be mistaken, though 
she learns to beware of accepting it. 

Of course, we all are doing something 
for others and expecting them to do 
for us. That is the equitable tit for 
tat of ordinary social Hfe. When done 
with sincerity and grace, it has the cour- 
tesy of well-bred social Hfe. But, if by 
circuitous methods we bring into this 
exchange the insidiousness of spoken 
bargaining or of silent expectation of 



getting much for little, we take the 
heart out of social intercourse. 

Sometimes we hear that flattery is 
bribery, but it hardly ever is objective 
enough to be so considered. For gen- 
uine praise, genuinely given, never 
hurts any one: and, though injudicious 
praise may make us conceited or lazy, 
it, yet, is not a bargain, tmless a mutual 
admiration society is formed. And, if 
it is, it is soon dissolved. The essence 
of bribery is the bargain involved, not 
as a square deal, but as a roundabout 
way of getting what we want, the one 
who gives being as much injured as the 
one who accepts. 

The following brief anecdotes show 
the pathway in which bribery travels 
imrecognized. A busy mother bribed 
her child with pennies each time it 
hindered her in her housework. At first 
a cent sufficed. That soon became a 
five or ten cent piece, and then a 
quarter, until the mother rebelled. It 
was too late. The child had had his 
own way too long, and long home misery 
resulted. Another mother gave her 
daughter a brooch for her good conduct. 
When, after several months, a second 
present had not followed, the girl asked 
if she had not been as good as before. 
**Yes, indeed," replied her mother. 
**Then why haven't you given me 
something?" was demanded. A lady 
was invited to lunch, and accepted. 
When some time after she decUned to 
do something, debatable, in philan- 
thropic work desired by her hostess, 
she was reminded that she had partaken 
of her hospitaUty. 

Because bribery has assumed various 
forms, ever since Jacob's and Esau's 
unequal division of birthright and 
pottage, is all the more reason why we 
should resist its present inroads into 
simpUcity of motive, and that our home 
life, as well as our pubUc work of every 
kind, should be protected from its 
harmfulness. 



The Art of Packing 

How to have a Comfortable Holiday 

By Katherine Hamilton Hough 



TO pack well is an art few 
women possess. The time is 
fast approaching when one's 
thoughts turn to the summer holiday 
outing, and any skill in the packing line 
is doubly appreciated at this psycho- 
logical moment. In order to feel happy 
on a holiday, one must be well dressed, 
and the way clothes are put into the 
trunk has much to do with bringing 
about this happy estate. One woman 
will pack twice as much in the same- 
sized trunk as her sister who does not 
understand the art, and her clothes, 
too, will "arrive" in better condition. 
In fact, it is the trunk that is most 
closely packed that has the best chance 
of reaching its destination in apple-pie 
order. For the corners are well filled, 
and there is no shaking about of articles, 
once the cover is down. 

From experience I have found that 
it is a good plan to commence a week 
or so before a joturney to jot down the 
articles that will be useful on the trip. 
Memory on the day of packing is apt 
to play traitor. A list of this kind will 
be found of immense assistance, when 
the real work begins. When you get 
up in the morning, ask yourself what is 
the first thing needed for the toilet 
and so on, perform the imaginary 
functions through the day, and so avoid 
the stupid little slips of memory that 
necessitate the starting out on a shop- 
ping expedition as soon as holiday town 
is reached. 

A great deal of the fatigue of packing, 
with many a backache, is spared if the 
trunk is raised a foot or so from the 
floor on a firm foundation. Another 
hint to the uninitiated is to collect the 
articles to be taken, and lay them on 
the chairs, etc., of your bedtoom. In 
this way you can cast your eye over 



them, and decide which is best to 
lay at the bottom of the trunk. This 
simple scheme will avoid a lot of chang- 
ing of plans, and racking of brains at 
the last moment. Every one will say, 
**Of course, heavy things go in the 
bottom of the trunk," but at the same 
time they will throw a forgotten book 
on top of blouses, and then wonder 
why clothes are so unmercifully crushed 
on being unpacked. It is not the 
weight of the book that does the mis- 
chief, but, being heavy, it slides about 
on the lighter clothing, and crushes it. 
All comers of the trunk must be filled, 
if only with soft paper. 

Apropos of blouses, there are envel- 
opes made of muslin, eighteen by 
twenty-two inches, into which the best 
Ungerie is slipped, together with its 
accompanying belt, stock, and pins. 
And a good way to keep dresses 
smooth is to fasten foiu^ rows of hook 
eyes in the inner side of the trunk, four 
inches apart, and draw a tape taut 
through the eyes. When a dress is 
folded and placed in the trunk, pin it 
to the tape with safety-pins. Use 
plenty of tissue paper between the 
gowns and their adornments, and, 
where the material is light and perish- 
able, put extra pieces in the folds. 
StuflF out the sleeves of bodices, and 
baste tissue paper around the collars 
and cuffs, where laces and embroideries 
are used as a trimming. 

In placing waists in the trunk, they 
should be arranged in alternate ways, 
one waist to another's neckband. 

Happy is the woman who has a trunk 
long enough to admit of placing skirts 
at full length, for a skirt can bear much 
folding from side to side, though but 
little from top to bottom. In fact, 
the less folding that is done, the better. 



The Art of Packing 



19 



Never turn a skirt wrong side out. 
The daintier the material, the more 
surely will it lose its freshness. Be- 
tween heavy coats and wraps put 
thicker tissue paper, that of the brown 
variety. 

When a .hat trunk is not in one's 
possession, be careful to fasten securely 
the chapeau in the position in which 
it is to travel. Long millinery pins are 
best for this ptupose, stuck through 
the brim of the hat to the bottom of 
the tray. The hat crown should be 
stuffed with tissue paper, and covered 
with a veil of the paper. Long feathers 
should be detached from the hat, rolled 
in soft silk, and twisted about the shape. 
Boots and shoes are slipped into bags, 
or rolled separately in paper, and laid 
at the bottom of the trunk, stockings 
and other substantial little odds and 
ends fitted in the interstices. 

A large, convenient tray is like a 
trolley car. No matter how crowded 
there is always room for one more. It 
will hold your hats, fans, gloves, hand- 
kerchiefs, everything but gowns and 
lingerie that should have plenty of 
room beneath. 

Most women are called upon to fold 
the wearing apparel of their big brothers 
or husbands, and the service is often 
conducive of coldness between the two, 
at the end of the jotuney. It is most 
difficult to fold trousers so that the 
creases shall be only those put in by 
the tailor. But by placing together 
the two brace buttons the crease will 
fall in the right lines. It is well to 
grasp the trousers by the lower edges, 
and let them fall at full length in the 
original creases. They can then be 
doubled once across without the slight- 
est injury. For folding the coat the 
principal thing to remember is that 
the sleeves should be pulled out slightly 
at the shoulder. The coat is then laid 
in three folds, the back falling between 
the two front breadths, and the second 
fold put in at the waist. 



A safe way to pack small quantities 
of medicine or toilet articles is to put 
them in tiny bottles enclosed in old 
glove fingers, and tie them on. Then 
pack all the bottles in a tin pail without 
a handle, put the top on tightly, and 
bury among the clothing. If bottles 
are carried in the usual way, rubber 
stoppers will be found less likely to 
work put of place than those made of 
cork. When the stopper is well in the 
bottle, give it a twist all the way around, 
and it will not come out till one twists 
it back again. 

Here is a scheme devised by a woman 
who spends much of her time on ocean 
steamers. She finds it much easier to 
carry a suit-case and a telescope bag, 
and to dispense with the steamer trunk. 
Shore clothes are put into the suit- 
case, and the telescope is separated, 
and the two parts placed tmder the 
berth to act as drawers. In one side 
the deck clothes are kept, and in the 
other half night clothes by day and 
day ones by night. In this telescope 
stocks and collars may also be stowed. 
She also hangs her shore hat in a roomy 
bag, and suspends it from the ceiling. 
Toilet articles are most gettable when 
kept in a pocket on the wall. 

The golf girl has a nice little trunk 
designed for her special needs, which 
is quite as convenient for the girl or 
man who is a favorite week-end guest. 
In size it resembles a steamer trunk. 
A compartment is arranged for golf bag 
and sticks; and sections with sliding 
partitions hold shirt-waists and hats. 
In the lid is a long space devoted to the 
packing of skirts. 

For some years it has been consid- 
ered smart and traveled to have one's 
trunk and suit-case and bag plastered 
over with foreign and domestic express 
and hotel labels and stamps. Now 
fashion has changed, and it is thought 
snobbish to display in this poster 
style one's **Httle journeys in the 
world." 



Royal Motherhood 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



ROYAL mothers are often more 
dutiful than some other aspi- 
rants to high positions. True 
womanhood graces many exalted places. 
A little story came to the writer from 
a Danish lady's maid. Once in the 
employ of a countess in Denmark, 
she lived opposite the royal palace in 
Copenhagen, and frequently attended 
her mistress on informal visits to the 
late Queen of Denmark, when often 
much time was given to fine music, 
duets, and social chat over afternoon 
tea. The family life was as simple, re- 
fined, and affectionate as could be 
imagined. The children, who came to 
visit the good queen, we know as the 
dowager empress of all the Russias, 
the lovely Queen Alexandra of Great 
Britain, King George of Greece, and 
Princess Thyra. Once they were all 
there, and also Prince Waldemar's fam- 
ily. One night the chief caretaker of 
the children of Prince and Princess 
Waldemar was taken ill. After seeing 
that she was made comfortable for the 
night, the princess did not leave her 
to the care of others. Early the next 
morning Princess Waldemar stepped 
into her room, and, finding her still 
asleep and the room cold, returned to 
her own room quietly, and brought back 
an armful of wood for the fireplace. 
The noise of the kindling fire awakened 
the nurse, who beheld in astonishment 
the princess, daughter of the old royal 
house of France, hard at work over the 
fire. She was very much touched by this 
kindness, and related it to her friends, 
the employees of the castle; among 
whom was the lady's maid who brought 
the story to this side of the Atlantic. 
It reminds one of the sweet tenderness 
of Saint Elizabeth of Himgary, who 
used to creep out from her castle with 
food for the hungry, in spite of her 
husband's remonstrances. One day, 



so the story goes, when he detected her 
and snatched her apron filled with 
bread, the loaves miraculously turned 
to roses and lilies. 

"That best portion of a good man's life, 
His little, nameless, unremembered acts 
Of kindness and of love." 

This Danish maid thought it strange 
that rough women and girls were chosen 
or taken from necessity as nurses for 
children. In Denmark, she said, nurses 
come from the educated, well-to-do 
middle class, and they are respected 
and suitably treated. 

We have all read of Queen Victoria's 
care for her children and the respect 
they were taught for their governesses. 
There is a school in England, where 
women of good birth, as daughters of 
army officers, are fitted to become in- 
structors to royalty and the nobility. 
Besides having a good education, they 
must be able to teach deportment, 
erect and graceful carriage, and the 
necessary etiquette for all formal oc- 
casions. These ladies are in demand 
in all parts of Europe. The new Crown 
Princess of Germany, CeciUe, had such 
an English governess. The czar sent 
for^ one to take charge of a young 
Georgian princess, really a political 
prisoner, although surrounded by every 
luxury, in St. Petersburg. Until she 
married, this English lady had the en- 
tire charge of her. This governess, 
now in the United States, bewails the 
snobbery and show of many American 
famiUes of large wealth. The constant 
thought of elaborate dress, rather than 
of fine arts and literature and gen- 
eral culture, the hurry and struggle for 
place and precedence, is noticeable, 
she says, also how even Uttle children 
take seats away from older people at 
pubUc resorts and clamor at public 
tables. The fault is in the training 



The Delayed Bloom 



21 



of the little folk, who know no better, 
and it re&ects upon the grasping spirit 
of the country. 

A recent lecturer, speaking of Italian 
gardens and describing the magnificent, 
solemn arches of ilex, tapestried with 
climbing roses, to be seen in the Quirinal 
gardens at Rome, said that one comes 
upon rows of little mud piles, gayly or- 
namented with chicken feathers and 
set to bake in the sun, on the great 
stone seats mossy with age. Just plain 
little mud pies, but made by the dimpled 
hands of sensible Queen Elena's little 
folk. Queen Elena, like the empress 
of Germany, is a devoted mother, busy 
in rearing a happy, healthy flock of 
girls and boys. Little has been pub- 
lished about the girlhood of the fair 
Empress Augusta; but Queen Elena, 
a Montenegrin princess, with her sisters, 
ran wild in the forests, hunting and 
fishing like boys, swimming like mer- 
maids, and riding wild ponies, until in 
their teens, when they were packed off 
to fine schools far away from the little 
mountain principality over which their 
father reigns. 

Bei^g domestic does not mean being 
a stupid drudge. When Mrs. Enid 



Stacy Widrington was lecturing in this 
country, she said enlightened women 
should have no quarrel with the word 
** domestic," as a desirable adjective. 
Taken in its narrowest sense, it may 
seem unpleasant; but, if a woman is 
truly domestic, she will widen the appli- 
cation of the word, until it will mean 
all that her heart can hold or her brain 
plan or her hands execute for those 
dear to her. She will know what a 
home should be, and how a house 
should be built for health, beauty, and 
economy, and what community or 
neighborhood is best, what schools and 
neighbors they will have, how to reg- 
ulate the income and apportion it 
properly, how to make the home a 
spot ever to be remembered when she 
is gone. And for those who do not 
love children the words of an American 
mother may bring a lesson : * 'Suppose 
your children are not all that you hoped 
or dreamed. They are yours; and, if 
they do not meet your expectations 
or fill your heart to overflowing with 
happiness, at least, if your duty be 
done toward them, it wiU so occupy 
your time that you will have no 
thoughts of regret and self-pity." 



The Delayed Bloom 

By Cora A. Matson Dolson 

One spring I set a blue wistaria vine, 

Close to my home, where it might climb and twine 

Upward, to reach the window of my room, 

And there to cheer me with its azure bloom. 

Each year I watched for buds, but none were there; 

Until, at length, I deemed our Northern air 

As alien tp the place where once it grew, 

And prized it merely for the shade it threw. 

But, when its years had grown to perfect seven, 

Across my window, blue as depths of heaven. 

Its clustered buds and blossoms swayed and swung, 

The tossing vines and guarding leaves among. 

My dear wistaria I Doubly dear to me 

Because its flowers I had not hoped to see. 

And so, sometimes, I deem a thought has grown. 

Prized, by two hearts, as Friendship's growth alone. 

When suddenly it bursts its bonds above, 

And, glorified, flames forth to perfect Love I

PROMISES. 

Beneath the cold gray skies of March 
The song- sparrow trilled his cheerful lay, 
A crocus blooming in the grass 
Gave promise bright of coming May. 

One April day a bluebird came, 

A vision of azure scudding by, 

'Neath pale gray clouds that hung below 

The deeper azure of the sky. 

The dandelions came in May, 

The brown thrush piped his cheeriest tune, 

All sound and color blent to make 

A pathway fit for royal June. 

And, when the queen came to her own, 
Rare roses blossomed beneath her feet. 
The lavish sun flung gold galore. 
And all earth rang with bird-notes sweet. 



So life is full of promises. 
Faint touches of beauty here and there, 
Brief strains of music, incomplete. 
Echoing songs of sweetness rare. 

Just urging on our faltering faith 
With glimpses of brightness by the way. 
O'er rough and unfamiliar paths 
That lead us to God's perfect day.

SCIENCE AND TRUTH 

SCIENCE and truth are one. 
For what is science save the 
knowledge of nature's laws, the 
facts of the universe? The lover of 
nature and nature's laws is likewise 
the lover of truth. Why ever the 
tendency among men to oppose the 
acceptance of new truth, to sneer at 
the revelations of science? Unless a 
scientific law or formula be true, it is 
sure to fail and become obsolete. 
Truth only lives. 

"Truth crushed to earth shall rise again: 
The eternal years of God are hers; 
But Error, wounded, writhes with pain, 
And dies among his worshippers." 

The desire for larger truth, wider 
acquaintance with the laws that gov- 
ern the universe, is human. Already 
science has done much for the welfare 
of man. She is destined, perchance, 
to do even more. In household af- 
fairs, especially, the appUcation of 
scientific discovery and invention has 
been of infinite worth. The difference 
between the habitation of the cliff- 
dweller and the modem home, warmed 
by hot water and lighted by elec- 
tricity, is wide, indeed. It is an 
index of the progress of the race thus 
far. 

In every branch of research and 
pursuit of life the scientific spirit is 
the true method of procedure. Hy- 
pothetical truth, if there be any such 
thing, must ever give way to fact and 
law. This is the teaching of history 
and experience. A theory is of no 
good unless it be universally work-

able. Even our faith is subjected 
to the processes of reasoning and the 
understanding. In speaking of the 
unquestioning faith of childhood, the 
editor of the Ouflook says: **The faith 
of manhood is of a different sort. It 
is not an tmquestioning, but a ques- 
tioned faith. It is not fotmded on 
reason; but it dares submit itself to 
all the tests to which reason can sub- 
ject it. The crucible never yet cre- 
ated gold, but it tries the gc4d and 
rejects the dross. Reason never yet 
created faith, but it separates the 
true from the false. After the cru- 
cible appears but little gold, but it is 
pure. After the reason there appears 
a shorter creed, but it is vital. Cre- 
dulity has done the world more harm 
than scepticism. The only way to 
know anything is to dare to question 
everything." 

Above all things, men are fond of 
liberty. They desire to be free, — 
free to live in harmony with the laws 
of nature; that is, in accordance with 
the divine will. *'He is the free man 
whom the truth makes free." 



HOME SANITATION 

IN no other respect is the aver- 
age country home more open to 
adverse criticism than in that of 
its sanitary condition. In city and 
large town, drainage and sewage are 
under control of public officials, and 
in certain fashion all are served alike. 
But in the country these important 
items become a matter of individual 
concern ; and, sad to say, in too many 
cases the drainage is entirely ignored, 
while the sink drain is left on the sur- 
face of the ground, — a constant source 
of menace to the health and comfort 
of every member of the household. 
But it has always been so, the in- 
mates may say, and we have lived 
to good old age. This may be true. 
At the same time it does not seem to 
have occurred to them how many 



cases of illness might have been avoided 
or how much better health they might 
have enjoyed, had the sanitary condi- 
tions of their home been more favora- 
ble. 

Nature does much in way of en- 
vironment for the country home, the 
inland dweller. Can the recipient of 
these favors do less than abstain from 
polluting the earth, and give nature 
a fair chance? As to whatever else 
one may do in way of cultivation and 
improvement, he may rest assured 
nature will respond, '*good measure, 
pressed down, and shaken together, 
and running over"; and, besides, to 
him who really is fond of this grand 
old earth, any defacement or defile- 
ment thereof is not only offensive, 
but positively painful. At any rate, 
in these days of hygienic living the 
sanitary condition, as to the entire 
environment of the home, even in 
minutest detail, must be sedulously 
attended to. 

STRENGTH AND HEALTH 

TO be well, must one be strong 
physically ? This is the dictum 
of G. E. Flint, whose specialty 
is the development of power and the 
maintenance of health through progres- 
sive exercise. He admits that some 
strong men are not healthy, but says 
that their ill-heialth is always due to the 
weakness of some part. **They are 
not entirely strong." But the con- 
verse is equally true: some healthy 
persons are not strong. Professional 
men and statesmen, of slender phys- 
ique, whom many school-boys could 
excel in any feat of physical strength 
or endiu*ance, have lived and worked, 
with scarcely a day's sickness, to a 
ripe old age. It may be said that 
strength is not merely a matter of

which will do perfectly the work put 
upon it, but this is not the ordinary 
imderstanding of strength.

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



However, this writer makes out a 
good case for the superiority of gen- 
eral exercise, like running or walking, 
or of hard work that brings all the 
muscles and organs into play, over 
such gymnasium work as is calcu- 
lated to develop particular muscles 
only. Dumb-bell work, for example, 
to one accustomed to it, does not 
cause the heart to beat or the Itmgs 
to expand, nor compel all the muscles 
and organs of the body to co-operate 
in activity, as does wrestling, boxing, 
or running. That such exercise con- 
duces to brain power, he argues in 
this way: *' Setting the advantages 
of physical evolution aside, so long 
as the brain needs food for its develop- 
ment, and the food to be digested needs 
a good stomach, and the stomach, to 
remain good, needs proper exercises 
of the muscles, so long will the culti- 
vation of physical strength be neces- 
sary for mental evolution." The no- 
tion that hard general work, resulting 
in full muscular development, saps 
vitality, weakens the organs, and is 
a wearying incubus to the individual, 
is dismissed as so illogical as hardly 
to deserve an answer. But those 
who believe it are admonished to 
**pity the wild animals that, guided 
only by an instinctive physiological 
need, run, jump, piu'sue and wrestle 
with one another, thereby using and 
developing fully their whole bodies. 
Strange it is that they are singularly 
free from disease, while man, who 
knows better than to do those things, 
is the most disease-ridden creature 
in existence." — Boston Herald, 



We shall soon enlarge the concep- 
tion of religion till we shall not use the 
term at all in a special or restricted 
sense. We shall see that all lovers 
of truth are lovers of God. When one 
pauses to look at it, what utter selfish- 
ness or selfism Ues at the bottom of 
the old creeds, — the one thought of 
a man to secure bis personal safety 



from some impending danger! The 
soldier who is determined to come out 
of the battle with a whole skin is not 
the ideal soldier. The man of science, 
the truth lover, how much more worthy 
his self-forgetfulness, his renuncia- 
tion, which has in view no personal 
end whatever! The new birth of sci- 
ence, — the dropping of all worldly and 
secondary ends, the absolute devotion 
to the truth for its own sake, — is there 
anything more truly religious than 
this ? — John Burroughs, 



**The home is a tryst, — the place 
where we retire and shut the world 
out. Lovers make a home just as 
birds make a nest; and, unless a man 
knows the spell of the divine passion, 
I can hardly see how he can have a 
home at all. He only rents a room." 

Health is a boon we value most 
When nearly giving up the ghost. 
'Tis only when we feel we're sinking, 
We're satisfied to do some thinking 
Of how we should ourselves behave 
In order best otnselves to save 
From neurasthenia's dire perdition, 
Abysses deep, where no contrition 
Can rescue from the pangs and woes 
Of gout and rheumatismal throes. 
Turn, sinner, while 'tis called to-day, 
Turn quickly from your sins away, 
And follow Nature's laws so true ; 
There's joyous health in store for you. 
Come, turn your steps toward Nature's 

ways, 
And comfort find, and length of days. 

K., — in Good Health. 

**Jdeas grow senile and slimiber and 
sleep, and die and lie in their graves for 
Ages, and come again in the garb of 
Youth to slaughter and slay — ^and in- 
spire and liberate. And this death and 
resurrection goes on Forever. In Time 
there is nothing new nor old. ' ' 



Small kindnesses, small courtesies, 
small considerations, habitually prac- 
tised in our social intercourse, give a 
greater charm to the character than 
the display of great talents and accom- 
plishments. — Kelty.

IN' all redpes where flour isused, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after sifting once. 
Wben flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. 
A tablespoonful or a teaspooi^ul of any desigtiated material is a level spoonful of such material. 



Broiled Scrod 
Dress a plump cod or haddock for 
broiling (so that it may lie flat upon 
the broiler). Put flesh side up in a 
pan, sprinkle generously with salt, 
then cover with cold water. In the 
morning drain, dry on a cloth, and broil 
in a well-oiled broiler over a clear fire. 
Spread with anchovy sauce, and ser\e 
at once. 

Anchovy Sauce for Broiled Scrod 
Pound the flesh of four anchovies, 
preserved in oil, and one-third a cup of 
butter in a mortar. Then press the 
mixture through a fine sieve. Melt one 
level tablespoonful of butter, and in it 
cook a level tablespoonful of flour and 
a few grains, each, of salt and pepper. 
Stir in half a cup of milk or white broth 
until the mixture thickens, then beat in 
the anchovy butter and a tablespoonful 
of lemon juice or vinegar. 



Boiled Salmon 
Take a middle cut of salmon, weighing 
about three pounds. Wash thoroughly, 
then lower into a kettle partly filled 
with lukewarm water. Add a table- 
spoonful of salt and three or four table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. Cover, and let 
heat to the boiling-point. Then let 
simmer nearly half an hour. Drain 
carefully, and set on a platter. Pour- 
over a cup of white sauce, to which a 
few capers and three tables poonfuls of 
butter have been added. Sprinkle the 
top of the fish with more capers. Set 
boiled halves of potatoes at the ends of 
the dish, and serve at once. 

Boiled Salmon with Fish Forcemeat 
Select a piece of salmon just 
below those with central opening.

Joinville Sauce 
Melt three table- 
spoonfuls of butter. 
Cook in this three 
tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and add one 
cup of rich veal broth, 
flavored with vege- 
tables, and herbs, and 
one pint of the hquid in which the fish 
was cooked. Let boll vigorously. Then 
simmer ten minutes. Finish with the 
beaten yolks of three eggs, mixed into 
three tablespoonfuls of creamed butter, 
a tablespoonful of lemon juice, half a 
teaspoonful of paprika, and {if at hand) 
enough lobster coral to give a reddish 
tint to the sauce.

side down, in the dish for cooking. 
With a silver knife spread the side from 
which the skin was taken with a thick 
layer of fish forcemeat. This may be 
made of salmon, halibut, or bass. For 
a more ornamental dish the forcemeat 
may be spread very lightly over the 
surface, and then the rest put in place 
with pastry bag and tube. Ornament 
the forcemeat with figures cut from 
slices of truffle. Set a very thin bit of 
fat salt pork over each piece of truffle. 
Put the fish into a saucepan, add a pint

For a piece of fish of the size given 

above purchase about a pound of fish. 
Remove the skin and bones, 
and scrape the fish from the

chopped meat, one cup of fine bread 

crumbs from the centre of a stale loaf, 

two unbeaten eggs, a teaspoonful of 

salt, a dash, each, of paprika and 

celery salt, a level teaspoonful of sugar, 

and a little fine-chopped parsley. Mix 

the whole together thoroughly, then 

form into balls. Roll these in flour 

to coat them lightly, then set into a 

frying basket, and plunge into a kettle 

of hot fat. Let cook about two 

minutes just long enough 

to coagulate the outside 

and keep the balls in 

shape. Drain on soft 

paper. Have ready, 

very hot, half a can of 

tomatoes, thickened with 

a level tablespoonful of 

flour mixed with half a

vinegar (one cup of 
vinegar to two quarts 
of water), — to which 
onion, carrot, celery, 
parsley, sweet herbs, 
and spices, cooked irt,

in .both directions (see page 338, Feb- 
ruary, 1906, magazine). Have ready 
two cups of boiled water, cooled to a 
lukewarm temperature, and Into this 
put the ball of dough. It will sink to 
the bottom of the dish, but wilfr gradu- 
ally rise as it becomes light. In about 
fifteen minutes it will float upon the 
water, alight, puffy "sponge." Into this 
water and sponge stir a teaspoonful of 
salt and between six and seven cups of 
flour. Knead or pound the dough about 
twenty minutes. Let rise in a tempera- 
ture of about 70° F., until the mass is 
doubled in bulk. Divide into pieces 
weighing about three ounces each 
(there should be about fourteen pieces). 



Rhubarb Fanchonetle* 

Shape these into balls. When all are 
shaped, with a sharp knife, cut down into 
each to make five divisions. Set the 
balls into buttered tins, some distance 



apart, brush over the tops generously 

with melted butter, and set to bake at 

once in a hot oven. Bake twenty or 

twenty- five minutes. 

When nearly baked, 

brush over with the 

beaten white of an 

egg, and return to the 

oven to finish baking. 

'Bake the biscuit as 

soon as they are cut 

and brushed with 

butter. Only by this 

means can the shape 

and fine texture of 

this form of bread be secured. This 

recipe is said, by those who have 

eaten the bread in Vienna, to give a 

near approach to this justly famous 

Vienna bread. The Hungarian wheat 

used in Vienna makes a difference in 

flavor, which cannot be exactly du- 

pUcated in this country. 

Cherry Pie 
Line a plate with pastry, put in as 
many stoned cherries as the pastry 
will conveniently hold, probably about 
a pint measured after stoning, sprinkle 
with half a teaspoonful, scant measure, 
of salt, about two-thirds a cup of sugar, 
and two tablespoonfuls of flour. Dot 
with bits of butter, a 
tablespoonful in all. 
Brush the edge of the 
pastry with cold water, 
and spread over the 
whole an upper crust. 
Press the two crusts to- 
gether closely on the edge, 
and brush the two edges 
with cold water. Bake 
about forty minutes. 
Tart cherries make the 
best pies. A little lemon 
juice improves a pie made 
with sweetish fruit.

ment, then drain, pressing 
out the liquid. Over a 
pint of the rhubarb turn 
a cup of sugar, sifted 
several times with half a 
teaspoonful of salt and 
three level tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir and cook 
until the mixture boils. 
Then add a tablespoonful 
of lemon juice or a grat- 
ing of orange rind and 
the beaten yolk of one 
or two eggs. Mix thoroughly, and set 
aside to become cold. Line small 
brownie or other tins with pastry. Fill

one measure of salt. Have ready a 
three-pint melon mould, partly packed 
in salt and crushed ice. Line the mould 
with the strawberry sherbet, and till 
the centre with a charlotte russe filling. 
Cover the filling with sherbet, filling 
the mould to overflow. Spread paper 
over the whole. Press the cover over 
the paper, and finish packing the mould. 
Let stand about two hours. When un-

with a wreath of spun sugar. 

Charlotte Russe Filling 
Beat one cup of double cream until 
solid to the bottom of the bowl. Beat 
the white of one egg dry ; then beat in 
one-third a cup of sugar and a teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla or two tablespoon fuls of 
wine. Mix the egg mixture with the 
cream, and use at once. 

Spun Sugar 
Cook two pounds and a half of granu- 
lated sugar and half a pound of glucose 
to 285"* F. Set the bottom of the sauce- 
pan in cold water a moment. Then 
remove from the water. Dip a sugar 
spinner into the syrup, and pass it over 
two rods set a Uttle distance apart on a 
table covered with clean paper, letting 
the syrup spin from the wires of the 
spinner in fine threads. If the syrup 



becomes toocold to spin, reheat a little. 
Whenamassof threads has been formed, 
take them from the rods and shape 
into a nest, or nests, of the size desired. 

Cupid's Wells with Ice-cream 

and Strawberries 
Any cake mixture may be used for 
these cases. Those shown in the il- 
lustration were made of cake mixed 
by the recipe for "Sponge Jelly Roll," 
given in the April magazine. This 
recipe calls for one cup of sugar, though 
no sugar was mentioned in the recii>e 
for Sponge Jelly Roll. Beat two eggs 
(without separating the whites and 
yolks) until very light, then beat in one 
cup of sugar and one cup of flour sifted 
several times with two and a half level 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder and one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of salt. Lastly 
beat in a teaspoonful of vanilla ex- 
tract and one-third a cup of hot milk. 
Bake in a shallow tin. When cold, cut 
into rounds. This sheet will make 
six rounds of suitable size. Mark out 
a circle on the top of each round about 
one-fourth an inch from the edge of the 
cake, and cut out the cake inside the 
circle to form cases. Cover the cases 
with white icing, and decorate with light 
green icing. Apply the latter icing 
with tiny round and leaf tubes, form- 
ing a vine with leaves. When ready 
to serve, fill the centres with vanilla 
ice-cream, and decorate with choice 
fresh strawberries.

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 



"The women of the home should so arrange their household duties as to allow time for outdoor 
d some form of healthful recreation — back to nature." — Egg-0-See Company. 



AN old adage nins something 
Uke this : ' 'A workman is known 
_by his tools," No one expects 
a carpenter with dull planes or broken 
saws, and who does not own a glue-pot 
or a spirit-level, to turn out a finished 
job. A woman may use a hair or hat 
pin for a larding-needle and bone a 
chicken or a fish with a knife that will 
not take, much less keep, an edge; 
but she who makes no effort to supply 
herself with fitting implements of her 
trade, certainly has no great love for 
her calling, and is not destined to shine 
therein. The cook who visits the pub- 
lic library to examine dictionaries of 
cooking, in order to discover what a 
certain chef uses in Holtandaise sauce 
to give it an odd and piquant flavor, 
will never beg for work. Her calling 
means more to her than the buying 
power of the money she receives on 
Saturday night. 

Yet, granting that this be true, the 
old adage needs an amendment or an 
addition, for the modem workman is 
known by the disposition he makes of 
his tools. A kitchen pantry has its 
uses, but it is turned from its legiti- 
mate purpose, when it is made into a 
storehouse for the utensils needed at 
the range and sink. Go into your 
kitchen to get breakfast or dinner, and 
coimt the steps you might save, were 
the various saucepans, frying-pans. 



forks, dredgers, etc., needed in the actual 
cooking of the meal, suspended from 
hooks on the wall at the back of the 
range or where the hand can be quickly 
laid upon them. Note the d^tance 
between the stove and sink. In two 
houses lately viated two rooms lay 
between them. Is the refrigerator con- 
veniently placed in reference to the 
pantry or the place where food is pre- 
pared for cooking? Modern houses, 
supposedly, are planned aright, but 
do not go on the supposition that 
whatever is is right. Do not waste 
your strength these bright mornings in 
useless, monotonous walking back and 
forth in the kitchen. Have things 
arranged to save steps, and put in the 
extra time on the veranda or under the 
trees. 

And, be you mistress or maid, pre- 
pare the fresh fruit for the table or 
fresh vegetables for cooldng in the 
same cool place. Do this, even if you 
are working at high pressure. You 
have heard of the woman with so many 
things to do that it was hard to decide 
which to do first, who, after a moment's 
consideration, concluded to do the most 
needful, and so lay down and took a 
nap. 

Simplify the cooking during the hot 
months. Complicated dishes, sauces, 
rich cakes, and pastry are certainly out

of season — to say the least. Fruit and 
berries are always welcome, and, when 
tired of the old way of serving with 
cream and sugar, try them with oil 
and add. Those who are conservative 
lose half the joy of life, and the first 
places where one's conservatism crops 
out is in respect to food. \ Cress or 
lettuce hearts quickly grown, and thus 
tender, harmonize well with fruit, and 
are needful for the perfect fruit salad. 
These need no special dressing, but, 
washed and carefully dried and used 
as a bed for the fruit, will take up a 
sufficiency of the ample supply of 
dressing provided for the fruit. In 
the dressing discard mustard. The 
best ohve oil is the main thing to be 
desired. If the fruit be sweet, lemon 
juice, a tablespoonful to each three -of 
oil, will be needed, with the salt, and 
paprika. For oranges, pineapples and 
berries cut down the quantity of lemon 
juice. In a raspberry salad use cur- 
rant juice rather than the juice of the 
lemon. 

Bread is always in great demand 
throughout the summer. Let it be 
varied in shape, texture, and material. 
Rolls or biscuits are, of course, baked 
more quickly than the same mixture 
in loaves. Mixed at ten o'clock at 
night, in the proportion of one-third 
a yeast cake to a pint of liquid (plus 
half a cup with the yeast), the dough 
will be ready to cut down at five and 
to bake at about seven o'clock in the 
morning. At this season it is no 
hardship to arise at that hour, es- 
pecially if by so doing one may take 
an hour for siesta in the heat of the 
day. 

Our ideas in regard to drinking 
water, food, drainage, and sanitation 
in general, have certainly advanced 



in the last fifty years. We no longer 
believe that sickness is a dispensation 
of providence, but the siu^ result of 
broken laws on the part of some one. 
Given certain conditions, and certain 
results will follow as surely as the night 
follows the day. At all times health 
is the result of eternal vigilance, but 
during the heated season this vigilance 
must be increased. City houses, where 
plumbing has not been lately renewed, 
and country houses, where there is no 
plumbing, alike need constant and 
unremitting supervision. Bad odors 
and bad drinking water are the chief 
sources of malaria, diphtheria, dysen- 
tery, and typhoid fever. All are the 
sure result of carelessness on yoiu* part 
or that of your neighbor. Uncovered 
drains are. a menace to the commu- 
nity. Clear, sparkling, nay, even pleas- 
ant-tasting water may be drawn from 
a well polluted by out-buildings and 
drains. The extent of territory drained 
by a well is larger than the average 
householder would beUeve. 

To-day the relation of food to health 
is recognized by the careful mother; 
and, in seeking to avoid occasion for 
complaints and disorders, common in 
summer, she takes cognizance not only 
of the drinking water, but avoids the 
presentation upon the table of ill- 
cooked vegetables (unsoftened cellu- 
lose), unripe fruit, or stale proteid sub- 
stances. If such disturbances of health 
do occur, rest in bed and fast from food 
are the remedies of the well-informed 
woman ; and, after the trouble is over, a 
hasty return to solid foods is not deemed 
expedient. Well-boiled rice with milk, 
arrowroot, cornstarch, or wheaten gruel, 
are given to tide over the time until 
a complete return to health is assured 
and a slow return to the ordinary diet 
is permissible. 



A Daisy Wedding 

By Inez Redding. 



WHEN the sacred marriage vows 
are pledged, the church seems 
always the fitting place for 
the ceremony, unless there be the 
feeling that some brides cherish, that 
a man should make a woman his wife 
only in the home of her parents, taking 
her therefrom to a home of her own. 
But the church ceremony is always 
sweetly solemn, and most often now 
is the sacred rite performed there. 
Almost every smart wedding has a 
distinctive featiu*e, which gives a name 
to the function. It may be a **noon 
wedding" or a **lily wedding" or a 
"white wedding." The maiden who 
is to take her place at the head of a new 
household in the early summer months 
will select wisely if she elects to have 
a ** daisy wedding." 

Her classmates will see that the 
church is decorated with the dainty 
blossoms. They will bring ferns or 
other fine greenery for the back of 
the altar, and bank it at the back for 
some distance above the head of the 
pastor, when he comes from out the 
side door with the bridegroom to wait 
the coming of the bride. They will 
gather the longest-stemmed daisies and 
weave amid the ferns, so that the rear 
of the altar shall be an immense screen 
of blossom and foliage. They will 
make wreaths or ropes of daisies for 
the front of the gallery. They will 
make gates of daisies and ferns, one of 
which the little flower girls will open to 
receive the wedding party within the 
chancel enclosure, and the other will 
be opened as they pass out after the 
ceremony. They will make a rope of 
daisies for the pews reserved for the 
family and intimate friends, and fasten 
great bunches of the dainty blossoms on 
the comer of each of the reserved pews. 
The church should be opened an hour 
before the time set for the ceremony, 



and the ushers should be in waiting 
at that time. Each usher — and six is 
the proper number, should wear three 
daisies as a boutonni^e. As the guests 
enter, each is escorted to a seat by 
an usher, who offers his right arm, and 
only a most discourteous person will 
indicate a preference in seats. The 
organist plays from the moment the 
doors are opened until the last member 
of the bridal party has left the edifice. 
At the appointed hour all the doors, 
except the one through which the bridal 
party will enter, are closed. And 
through this pass the six ushers and 
the six bridesmaids wearing white 
gowns, and each carrying at her side 
a large bunch of daisies. The hand 
which closes over the stems should be 
held well down and close to the body, 
while the blossoms rest on the corsage. 
The maid of honor following the bride's 
attendants walks alone, and her flowers 
may well be calla lilies, if these are 
easily procurable, or white peonies. 
The bride with her shower bouquet of 
lilies of the valley, her right hand rest- 
ing on the arm of her father, follows, 
and at the altar they meet the waiting 
groom. Softly, very softly, the organ 
is played while the ceremony is being 
performed, and at its close peals out in 
triumphant strains as the bride, taking 
the arm of her husband, passes through 
the gate of flowers, and, preceded by 
the little flower girls with their baskets 
of rose leaves, which they scatter before 
her, passes down the aisle, following 
her attendants, and followed by the 
ushers. 

The moment the party is outside the 
door, each member of the family and 
those occupying reserved seats are 
escorted to the door by the ushers. 
Then the ribbons, which have been 
stretched past the entrances to the pews, 
are removed, and the function is ended. 



How we kept House after the Earthquake 

at San Jose, Cal. 



By Jessie Juliet Knox 



EVEN itt moments of greatest 
terror one must think of the 
ordinary things of life; and 
never before has been so plainly dem- 
onstrated the old saying, ** Self-pres- 
ervation is the first law of nature.*' 

When the great shock came, it was 
just at dawn; and all were asleep. 
No one can ever describe the awful- 
ness of that moment, when the whole 
house and everything in it were shaken. 
We jumped from the bed; but, before 
we could get out of the bedroom door, 
roof and chimney fell in on the bed 
we had just left. It is not pleasant 
to look death in the face in this way. 
In fact, it is the quintessence of hor- 
ror. Before we could get to our one 
child, it seemed a lifetime. At last 
we three together tried — I say tried — 
to go downstairs. Surely, it must 
have been a century before we accom- 
plished that seemingly simple feat. 
For we were knocked down over and 
over again, and beaten and banged 
against the sides of the stairway. We 
felt no physical pain then, however, 
because we were in a trance of mental 

agony. 

When, at last, we succeeded in reach- 
ing the large front door, which is al- 
ways locked, and also has a burglar 
chain, it was wide open. Some people 
could not open their doors at all, but 
had to break a window to get out. 
The great dragon inside the earth is no 
respecter of bolts and bars and burglar 

chains. 

Once outside, in the chill of the 
early morning, we foimd every one 
arrayed in the same airy fashion as 
ourselves. It did not seem at all out 
of place for people to be in the middle 
of the street in night robes, conversing 
m terrified tones about the awful thing 



which had just happened. As soon as 
people could gain courage, they ran 
back into their wrecked homes, if 
possible, and then ran out again with 
anything they could find in the way 
of clothing. They were dressing in 
all the streets and parks, and many 
things happened that would be most 
ludicrous at any other time, but now 
life was too serious a thing. It was 
no time for laughter. 

One man, who was in his bath, 
rushed out into the streets in natural 
state, except that he had picked up 
the only thing he could find, which 
happen^ to be the funny page of a 
Simday paper; and this he had wrapped 
around him. A kind-hearted lady took 
off a short petticoat, and gave it to 
him. The building from which he 
ran was destroyed, and we never heard 
what became of him. 

After the first excitement had some- 
what subsided, people began to feel 
faint, and knew they must make an 
effort to get some breakfast. Now 
began the ordeal of housekeeping under 
difficulties. We never had really ap- 
preciated our blessings until this mo- 
ment. A gas range and every modem 
convenience we had always taken as 
a matter of course ; but now, trembling, 
faint, and desiring a cup of hot coffee 
more than anything else in the world, 
we crept into the kitchen, thinking 
we could, at least, have some coffee, 
and be ready to jump out of the door 
at the slightest tremor. Our first 
glance was into the pantry. When we 
had left it the night before, it had 
been a thing of beauty, from the house- 
wife's view-point ; but now — ah, now ! — 
canned fruit, broken bottles, pickles, 
cornstarch, eggs, molasses, — every- 
thing under the shining heavens (for 



How we kept House after the Earthquake 



41 



the heavens had the audacity to be 
shining even then), — ^were piled up a 
foot deep all over the pantry floor, 
a d had to be removed later with a 
hoe. The neat shelves were a mass 
of ruins. Stepping carefully over the 
nauseous-lookhig heap, we finally suc- 
ceeded in reaching the coffee, which, 
fortunately, had not been thrown 
down. Our mouths fairly watered at 
the prospect. It would only take a 
minute, as one can cook so quickly with 
gas. Striking a match, we turned 
on the — ^what? No gas? Only the 
faintest suggestion of it, and with this 
feeble imitation it took an age to boil 
enough water for coffee. No sooner 
was the coffee fiinished than the gas 
departed entirely. Our menu consisted 
of bread and coffee, and we were lucky 
to get that. 

By this time we began to worry 
about many friends who might even 
now be dead. Hurrying to the 'phone, 
we fotmd that the electricity had been 
shut off all over San Jos6 ; and we could 
not commtmicate with any one. All 
around us we could see houses shat- 
tered like kindUng wood ; but we dared 
not leave home, and otu* neighbors 
were all as one big family. Fences 
were broken down, so that we might 
be sociable. People were now friends 
who had been enemies. Sorrow is a 
great leveller, and knows no caste. 
The men got to work, and built camp 
stoves of brick, either in the streets 
or the yards; for there were brick in 
plenty that day, as every chimney 
in the "garden city" had fallen. 

We were afraid to leave home for 
fear of another shock, so in each block 
of the city, surrounded aUke by beauty, 
ruin, and desolation, huddled fright- 
ened groups of people, ^11 filled with 
the same awful fear, and with love 
for the whole world. 

When the reports from San Fran- 
cisco reached us later on, it seemed 
like a horrible nightmare ; and we could 
not really believe that San Francisco, 



the gay and beautiful and prosperous 
queen of the Pacific, was being de- 
stroyed. But it was true, alas! it 
was true. 

And now came the refugees, by the 
thousand, from 'Frisco. Also came 
the fear of a food famine. We were 
feeding the hungry thousands at the 
depot ; but would there be enough food 
left for ourselves? It was whispered 
everywhere, **You had better lay in 
a supply of provisions while you can, 
as there is going to be a famine." And 
we did so; for very few had cash in 
their pockets, and some dealers would 
not sell on credit. Our home was al- 
most a wreck, so we kept house in 
the orchard. Our camp stove was 
very popular, as we had been fortu- 
nate enough to find an old iron sink 
in the basement; and this, with plenty 
of bricks and a stove-pipe, made a 
splendid stove. We put an awning 
over it, too, — an tunbrella right over 
the stove; but we didn't get the um- 
brella until our breakfast had been 
cooked in the pouring rain. Trifles 
Uke this did not matter in the least, 
though, compared with the magni- 
tude of the sorrow which had come 
upon us. 

In 'Frisco milHonaires were seen 
carrying frying-pans and coffee-pots, 
and cooking on the camp fires, which 
were now made in some of the most 
noted thoroughfares of the dty. Mill- 
ionaires, too, stood in the ''bread 
line," waiting himgrily for a loaf of 
bread, side by side with the "South of 
Market" tough. Nob Hill aristocrats 
were glad to drink from the same cup 
with the painted denizens of Grant 
Avenue; and all forgot to be haughty 
and scornful, only remembered to be 
kind and loving, for all aUke shared 
the common woe, and all alike were 
cold and hungry and thirsty. 

After all, there is so little one really 
needs, — only to be warm, to sleep, and 
drink and eat. 

At the very time when one could 



42 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



not afford to eat, everybody had rav- 
enous appetites, because of being con- 
stantly out of doors, and everything 
t a ste d iike a king's food ; and coffee — 
bracing, hot coffee — sipped out of 
doors, in company with fried corn- 
cakes and green onions, was like the 
ambrosial nectar of the gods. It is 
true we are all as brown as Indians ; but, 
you see, it does not matter now, for we 
realize that such things don*t count. 

All over the * 'garden city*' people still 
are sleeping in tents, — tents in the park, 
tents in the street, tents in the yards, — 



everjrwhere. We have gas now, and 
the telephone; but the camp stove is 
still there, if needed, and we are still 
sleeping in tents. The inside of a 
house, no matter how beautiful, does 
not attract us now; and we live out 
of doors in the sweet spring sunshine, 
and breathe the odor of flowers, which 
are more exquisite and more lavish, 
it seems to us, than they ever were 
before. 

Housekeeping in primitive style is 
not so bad, after all. There are worse 
things. 



The Kitchen Pantry Beautiful 



By a Skilful Artisan 



HERE are some dravdngs of 
boxes reconstructed from 
empty cigar boxes for service 
on the shelves of the kitchen pantry. 
Empty cigar boxes are available in 
every household. If not, the cook or 
some other industrious person about 
the house can visit the nearest cigar 
store, and obtain a collection of empties. 
Of course, the empties are liberally 
decorated with colored labels, and 
these are often pasted on quite securely. 
But a few saturations with a wet sponge 
and a Uttle scraping with a kitchen 
knife will remove the ornamental ad- 
vertising matter. The paper covering 
at the edges answers the purpose of 
holding the seams together to a certain 
extent. But you can strengthen the 
box comers with additional fine nails 
or by means of metal comers or angles. 
Then the partition work put inside 
serves to strengthen the parts. In 
figure I we exhibit the box in condition 
for preparation. The partitioning of 
the box for bottled preserves is done 
as in figure 2. The best way to get 
the stock for making the partitions is 
to break up other cigar boxes, one or 



more. Cut your strip to extend length- 
wise the box, and insert it. Put some 
thin wire nails, or regular cigar box 
nails, through the ends and botto^i, 
into this dividing section. Then cut 
out the cross partitions, and secure 
them in the same way. 

The dousing in moisture, to remove 
the gummy labels from the box, will 
have destroyed the fabric and paper 
hinge of the lid, and therefore you will 
need go to a hardware store and buy 
some very light metal hinges of the strap 
order. These may be connected with 
the cover and body of the box with 
small screws or soft metal nails, which 
may be turned inside, and thereby 
afford a gripping joint. A little piece 
of leather strap and knob on the lid 
and front of box affords a means of 
securing the cover down for closing. 
Of course, you can use the box in this 
order. Or you may do some painting 
or staining. Stains are always appro- 
priate to use. Painting destroys the 
natural color of the wood, and wood 
finishes are not possible. Therefore, 
staining and varnishing usually follow 
next. Some ornamental brass-work

msLy be put on, if desired, and the little 
chest is finished. 

A kindred one, made for keeping 
silver polish in, is shown in figure 3. 
It is best to select a flat, low box for 
this service, as the apartments would 
be too deep for retaining the various 
ingredients used in polishing metals. 

The dainty and orderly cook often 
likes to have several spice boxes on the 
pantry shelves, and we exhibit such a 
box in figure 4. This is made much 
like the silver poUsh box, except that 
the apartments are divided off differ- 
ently, to accommodate the various 
spices. A tray is often handy for ser- 
vice in one of the higher boxes. If a 
deep box is partitioned off, it is diffi- 
cult to get at the bottom of the deep 
places. Therefore, some of the boxes 
are divided off to half the depth of the 
box. Then a tray is made, as in figure 
5, to fit into the upper portion. 

The easiest way to make these trays 
is to measure off on a box the proper 
proportions, and remove the lid. Then 



\the box body is divided into the 
required sections, and it is ready 
for use. In figure 6 is exhibited 
a large-sized spice box for the 
tidy kitchen girl. 

In order to make a box of this 
design, the largest pattern of cigar 
box should be chosen. Owing to 
the large size of the box, some 
additional securing of the comers 
will be required. You can buy 
brass or white metal or common 
iron comers, straps, and the like 
at the dealers in builders' hard- 
ware. The Ughtest of tnetal trim- 
mings are required for the delicate 
wood of the cigar box. No pantry 
is complete without the conven- 
tional tool box. The tool chest'of 
the hardware store is too bulky. 
A very handy Uttle cigar box 
chest for pantry tools can be 
made from a good large cigar box, 
as in figure 7. One-half the box 
should be divided off, and a tray pro- 
vided for tacks, nails, and little hooks, 
devices so convenient to have at hand 
in the kitchen. Then the other divi- 
sion of the box can be used for tools, 
such as a hammer, screw-driver, and 
one or two other useful implements. 
A strap may be nailed across the lid 
inside for holding a few small tools. 
A chest of this kind is of great service.

One cook saved old corks. Figtire 8 
is the way in which the cigar box was 
arranged for this. The lid was taken 
off. Then four pieces of common tele- 
graph wire were cut 8 inches long, each, 
and bent to the form shown. Then 
with Uttle staples the wires were fast- 
ened to the edges of the box. 

Some ingenious pantry maids save 
all pieces of twine for future use. 
In figure 9 is a twine box made of a 
cigar box. The edge trimming is simply 
strips of thin leather tacked on. One- 
half the box is used for pieces of twine, 
and the other for a ball of twine. 
Shears are arranged in a leather loop 
in the lid. Figure 10 is a match safe, 
made by using a very small cigar box. 
The base or back board is made from 
the lid or bottom of a larger box. 
The wood is so soft and thin that the 
pattern work can, as a rule, be cut 
out with a sharp knife. 

Figure 1 1 is a drawing of a series of 
boxes, one above the other, in tier 
form. Three boxes are selected, and 
side boards are utilized for the support 
of the same, as shown. Then the 
boxes are finished off as desired, and 
used for pumice, potash, and soap for 
cleaning purposes. Bills, accounts, 
cards, receipts, etc., are often scattered 
about the shelves of the pantry. Fig- 
ure 12 shows a convenient little cigar 
box on legs for receiving these articles. 
Artistically curved legs are not neces- 
sary. Straight ones are more readily 
made, and will do as well. 

An ornamented pantry shelf box is 
shown in figure 13. It takes time and 
patience to make the cigar box over to 
this form. You can make the orna- 
mental work of wood, fret-sawed out, 
or you can buy decorating sheet metal 
at the hardware store, and secure it to 
the wood surfaces with little nails. 

Many hke growing plants in the 
kitchen. A cigar box for a plant box 
should be square, and deep enough to 
hold plenty of earth. Only light plants 
can be thus accommodated. 





Figure 14 illustrates a good way to 
construct such a box. Then, again, in 
figure 15 we exhibit a combination made 
much like the match device shown 
above. In this polish-box combination 
a back is made for supporting the pohsh 
box, as shown. On the back are brass 
hooks for brush, etc. 



Foreign Pensions 

By Arthur W. Bray ley 



PROBABLY 50 per cent, of 
American visitors to Europe 
stay at pensions. We call them 
boarding-houses in this country, but 
it would never do to refer to them by 
that term in the presence of the pro- 
prietors. Boarders, indeed 1 They may 
take paying guests, but boarders ! Hor- 
rors I 

In London, Bloomsbury, bounded by 
Tottenham Court Road, Euston Road, 
Southampton Row, and New Oxford 
Street, is the great boarding-house dis- 
trict, and is often referred to as Yankee 
land. Within this territory one is al- 
most certain to meet friends from the 
United States. It is safe to say that 
90 per cent, of the buildings within 
this boundary are pensions, and their 
name, often that of some State in 
America, is emblazoned in large brass 
plates or painted over the door. They 
are substantial old-fashioned brick 
structures that will before many years 
'•fall in" to the possession of the owner 
of the land. Should you ask your host 
what is meant by "falling in," you will 
be told that the land on wUch the 
houses rest is owned by some member 
of the Royal house (the holdings of the 
Duke of Bedford being the largest), and 
that at the expiration of the one hun- 
dred years' lease the buildings revert 
to their titled owners, although they 
have not expended one penny on the 
erection or maintenance of the build- 
ings. 

Leasing a building located on this 
land is no trifling matter. I have seen 
one of these leases, and it covered 
twenty closely written sheets of fools- 
cap, and it included every clause that 
would benefit the landlord. Among the 
many items was one specif 3ang that the 
occupant should once in twelve months 
"do up" the interior and exterior of 
the building, by which was meant that 



the interior must be renovated and the 
exterior painted and "pointed." This 
annual painting gives an opportunity 
to the tenant to use his or her individual 
taste as to color, with the result that no 
two houses in the long row of buildings 
on either side of the street are of the 
same color, producing an effect more 
or less startling, to say the least. Jt 
is interesting to note that nearly every 
structure in London is of light-colored 
stone or is painted in the lightest 
shades, — this in a city where the soot 
is so dense that but a few weeks' ex- 
posure is sufficient to give them a coat- 
ing of grimy black. 

A great many of these pensions ad- 
vertise for guests, and are not particu- 
lar as to whom they entertain; but a 
few of the more exclusive have no signs 
on their doors, and will receive only 
those who have letters of introduction. 
The prices vary from thirty-five shil- 
lings up per week, inclusive, according 
to room, which means that you receive 
room, breakfast, luncheon, tea, and 
dinner, although in the off season the 
terms are reduced. This price does not 
include heat. That is paid for at eight- 
pence per scuttle for coal, and the few 
houses that enjoy the luxury of a bath- 
room charge sixpence per bath. Of 
course, you may "tub" in your room as 
much as you wish without charge, ex- 
cept, perhaps, a small tip to the maid 
for fetching water. 

During my two years' stay in London 
I had a rather varied experience in 
domestic economy, having made my 
home in hotel, lodgings, private houses, 
and pension, and thereby come to know 
wherein lie the advantages of the latter. 
Hotel life in London is pretty much 
the same as in all large cities, — is ex- 
pensive and lonely. The lodgings, where 
you order your own food and have it 
cooked by the landlady and served in 



46 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



your rooms, are enough to drive a man 
to dissipation. The private family 
scheme is all right, if you happen in 
with the right family, but that is a 
chance. At last I settled in an exclus- 
ive pension, and rounded out a winter 
and a summer as a "paying guest.*' 
The landlady was a charming English- 
woman who had been mistress of the 
house for twenty years, during which 
time she had endeared herself to hun- 
dreds of American tourists who had 
made her house their home during their 
stay in London. Her house during the 
season always was full, but during the 
winter the long dining table was short- 
ened, and those who found a place at it 
were in the main "permanent" guests. 

There were nine guest-chambers in 
the house, six of them being large 
square rooms, and the working force, 
besides the mistress, consisted of cook, 
** 'tween" girl, chambermaid, and table- 
girl. That no manfolk was included in 
the list of servants was quite exceptional 
in a house of this kind, as almost every 
other pension sheltered one or more 
young men from Germany, France, 
Russia, or other nation, who sought 
employment in these places at a "little 
a week," in order to learn the English 
language ; and it is no uncommon sight 
to see them through the windows on 
warm days, minus coat and waistcoat, 
working in kitchen or dining-room. 

One is never warm in London from 
November until March, except when in 
bed. The poky little fireplace, filled 
with bituminous coal that is supposed 
to heat each room, is well enough, so 
long as you cuddle up to it almost 
within the danger Une, but move a few 
feet away, and one experiences a most 
disagreeable chill. The houses are 
poorly ventilated, necessitating the 
opening of windows, to remedy this 
sanitary defect, but this adds to one's 
discomfort. The natives will smile at 
your congested features and complaints 
of low temperature, and will give you to 
understand that they enjoy the cool 



and breezy rooms. But watch them. 
It is dollars to doughnuts that, when ofif 
guard, they will seek the warmest comer 
and a place nearest the fire. Of course, 
the temperature is not so low as we 
have it in New England. One wishes it 
was, instead of that dreary drizzle, 
searching chill, that reminds a Bos- 
tonian of the east winds of fall or spring 
at home. 

How may one account for this pe- 
culiar and inadequate heating arrange- 
ment? It is not that soft coal is 
cheap : it costs from twenty to thirty 
shillings per ton, and gives but 40 per 
cent, of heat, while we pay $7 per ton, 
and obtain 75 per cent, of heat. The 
American furnace, steam, and hot-water 
apparatus man is in the field, and is 
slowly, very slowly, introducing his 
goods; but even in the newest business 
buildings the old-time fireplace or gas 
radiator is depended upon. In looking 
for office accommodation, I called at a 
large new building in the Strand. It 
was fitted up with "lifts" and other 
modem improvements, and contained 
over four himdred offices, but every one 
of those four himdred rooms had the 
regulation fireplace, and tenants were 
compelled to buy coal by the scuttle 
and have the fires attended to by the 
care-taker. 

But let us back to the pension. The 
menu at the pension where I made my 
home was, I have good reason to believe, 
superior to the majority of houses of its 
class, and was supposed to represent 
good old EngUsh cooking. Because the 
guests were Americans, cereals were 
served at breakfast, but that meal was 
never known to pass without bacon 
and boiled eggs. There were kippered 
herring, steak, and broiled finnan haddie 
for a change ; but bacon and eggs were 
always there . No matter if cold or over 
or under done, it was on hand, and, 
strange to say, I never knew my English 
friends to refuse it. Orange and plum 
marmalade were also a breakfast and 
(Continued on page 54.) 



Economical Suggestions 
" ^T7HAT shall we do with all this 
VV melted ice-cream? What a 
wasteful act to throw it away!" This 
remark was made to my up-to-date 
niece, who promptly answered, "Let 
me take charge of it, for 1 can make 
of it a nice dessert." When a tempt- 
ing mould of cream appeared at dessert, 
she told me it was 

Moss Crbam 

Use one cup and a half of the cream, 
one glass of wine, and the jutce of a 
lemon. Beat thoroughly together. 

Soften one-quarter a box of gelatine 
in one-quarter a cup of cold water. 
Let stand about twenty minutes. Then 
add one-half a cup of boiling water, 
and stir until dissolved. Add one- 
quarter a cup of sugar, and let stand 
until cool. When the mixture begins 
to thicken, add the cream mixture, and 
beat until thoroughly mixed. Then 
put it in the mould. 

Finding this invention of my niece 
so palatable, my ambition was roused 
to see if something equally good could 
be made of the cream in the way of 
cake. I therefore made 

Thin Gingerbread 
Beat two generous tablespoonfuls 
of butter to a cream. Gradually beat 
in two heaping tablespoonfuls of gran- 
ulated sugar. Add one well-beaten 
egg, and then one cup of the cream. 
Sift one cup of pastry flour with two 



teaspoonfuls of yellow ginger and two 
level teaspoonfuls of baking-powder 
together, and stir into it with enough 
more pastry flour to make a dough 
stiff enough to roll out. Roll very 
thin, and cut in fanciful shapes. Have 
at hand a saucer of granulated sugar, 
and, before setting the cakes into the 
baking-pan, press each down firmly 
into the sugar. Bake to a delicate 
brown. c. j. 

* 
Nopals 

USE only the small, tender leaves 
of the nopal, and remove the 
espinas, or thorns, with a pen-knife. 
Cut the leaves in tiny squares, and 
boil in salted water until very tender. 
Put in a cazuela a tablespoonful of 
lard. When hot, add a little chopped 
onion, and fry lightly. Now add about 
a pint of the nopals, well drained, a 
tomato chopped, half a cup of hot 
water, salt to taste, and one dried 
chili. If the tomatoes are juicy, no 
water will be required. Cook half an 
hour, and serve with halves of hard- 
cooked eggs around the dish. An ad- 
dition, much liked by the Mexicans, 
is a few shrimps, either fresh or canned, 
added to the nopals while cooking. 
The dried chiU is prepared by soaking 
in water fifteen minutes, and then 
grinding in a melate. 

Palmetto 

Palmetto is the large bud at the 

extremity of the cabbage palm, and 



48 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



has a delicious nutty flavor. First 
take off the outer covering, or husk, 
then commence to slice very thin. 
After slicing awhile, you will find that 
the outer part becomes tough. Re- 
move it, and slice again, removing the 
successive layers as they become tough. 
When it is all sliced fine, put in a cazuela 
with one-half a chopped onion and 
tomato. Brown slightly, and add a 
little hot water or broth, one-half a 
teaspoonful of salt and a little chili, 
either green or red, if liked. Dried 
meat previously soaked may be added. 
Palmetto makes a nice salad by boil- 
ing, and then using a boiled mayon- 
naise or plain French dressing. Do not 
put any onion with the salad. 

Small green calabasas, or summer 
squash, are superior to egg-plant when 
prepared in the following way: Cut in 
slices, one-fourth an inch thick, put in 
salted water for one hour. Drain, dip 
in flour, and fry in plenty of lard. 

Jirimiquers, which resemble ttunips, 
and are eaten raw, are made into a 
salad by peeling, cutting in slices, add- 
ing sliced oranges and a few seeds of 
chili. Add salt and a little oil and 
vinegar. 

Chiotes are parboiled in their skins, 
then peeled and cooked like turnips 
or fried with onion and tomatoes. 

The combination of onion and to- 
matoes and a little garlic fried together 
and used in nearly every vegetable 
and meat dish is one of the reasons of 
the savoriness of some Mexican cooking. 

Mexican beans, either brown or 
black, are always better if boiled three 
or four hours the day before using. 
Next day put one tablespoonful of 
lard into a cazuela. Make very hot. 
Add a pint of boiled beans, some of 
them partly maished, salt to taste, 
and cook one hour longer. They must 
be very moist when cooked. Mashed 
and fried brown with a little chili 
and onion, they will be found to be 
very nice. Rose RussHtL. 



A FRIEND returning from a six 
weeks' visit to Cuba is enthusi- 
astic over the use of the green pep- 
per and the red sweet peppet or 
pimento there; and now she is de- 
lighting her family by presenting them 
each day with some new dish — new, at 
least, to them, and probably to many 
of the rest of us — ^in which one or the 
other figures. 

She makes a very delicious salad 
by cutting the green peppers in halves, 
removing the seeds and white mem- 
brane, and placing them in a very 
hot oven, just long enough to remove 
the outer tough skin. When cold, 
the peppers are arranged in a flat dish, 
alternately, with slices of fresh tomato; 
and the salad is served with French 
dressing. A very attractive and good- 
tasting salad in which lettuce does not 
appear. 

Another salad served by her at a 
Lenten luncheon was very pretty and 
pleasing to the palate as well. For 
this six eggs were cooked twenty 
minutes. The yolks were removed 
from the whites and put through a 
pur^e sieve. The whites were cut 
into narrow strips, and the pimentos, 
the kind that come in cans, were cut 
into strips as well. Crisp leaves of 
lettuce were arranged in a salad dish. 
Over them were laid the shredded 
whites of the eggs, then the strips of 
pimentos, then the yolks of the eggs, 
and, lastly, a few more pimento strips 
for garnish. A French dressing, of 
course, was used with this, too. 

A very good little entree for a limch- 
eon is made by placing pimentos in 
individual bakers, or ramekins, arrang- 
ing them so that they just fit the dish, 
and lining the sides, leaving a place 
in which an egg is broken. The bakers 
are then placed in a pan of water, 
put in the oven, and allowed to remain 
until the egg is set. A Bechamel 
sauce is poured over, which is a pleas- 
ing addition. 

Rice, chicken, and tomato in cas-

serole is easy to prepare, and usually 
a delight to men. A cup of cold cooked 
chicken, diced, a cup of boiled rice, 
and a green pepper, chopped fine, and 
well seasoned with salt, are arranged 
alternately in the casserole. Over all 
is poured half a can of tomatoes. This 
is baked half an hour, or perhaps a 
little less, if the oven is very hot. 

A slice of ham is given new flavor 
and made delicious by this novel treat- 
ment. Placed in a baking-pan, it is 
covered with one chopped green pep- 
per, half an onion grated. Over all 
is poured half a can of tomatoes. This 
is cooked from thirty-five to forty-five 
minutes in a moderate oven. 

A Cuban canap^, which may not be 
new to all, is so attractive to both the 
eye and the palate that it should be 
included, we think, in this list of Cuban 
dishes. On a rotuld of toast is placed 
a thick slice of tomato, over which is 
poured a teaspoonful of French dress- 
ing. On this is laid a ring of green 
pepper, made by cutting the pepper 
through with a knife, and removing 
the seeds and inner white skin. And 
in the middle a teaspoonful of Par- 
mesan cheese adds greatly to the color 
effect, and taste as well, so that the 
whole is a delicious appetizer and at- 
tractive setting to the table.

A GOOD thing to know is, if you 
place a covered jug of milk or 
cream in a pan of cold water, it will 
not ttun soiu" so quickly as if left 
standing without the water, and, if 
placed in an ice box in this manner, 
will keep during a thunder-storm. 

Mrs. L. C. F. 

TO prevent Oriental or ingrange 
rugs from slipping on hard-wood 
or painted floors, use common felt 
carpet paper, which should be cut in 
strips nearly as long and wide as the 



rug. These strips placed on the floor 
imder the rug will prevent wrinkling 
or sliding, which is such a trial to the 
good housekeeper. • l.

THE smell of fish that is so hard 
to remove from pans and plates 
by washing or soaking will yield to 
lemon skin rubbed over them. This 
will kill the flavor of even salt mackerel 
and salmon in a bake-pan. After 
rubbing with the lemon, let the dish 
stand for a Uttle, then wash in cold 
water, and rinse with hot. 



If you want a shirt-waist box, you 
can fashion one prettier and more 
convenient than those to be bought. 
If the outer surface is smooth, decorate 
it in geometric designs with poker 
work. If this is beyond you, cover 
the box with matting, cretonne, or 
cartridge paper. First line the inside, 
padding it with sheets of wadding, 
between which you have sprinkled 
liberally yoiu" favorite sachet powder. 
Take sheets of board, such as artists 
draw upon, and cover. Attach to the 
ends ribbons for lifting. Use these 
to separate the waists, so that all do not 
have to be handled when you want 
to get one. 

An acceptable present for most 
girls who wear white waists and do 
not Uve at home is a set of irons. 
These come in different shapes for 
fancy ironing. Some are long and 
very narrow, and some are oval. 
Some are made with electric attach- 
ment, and others are heated by being 
placed over gas or regular range. The 
finer waists are easily laundered in 
one's room, and will escape the tears 
and strain that are given them when 
sent out. The same is true of laces. 



For removing stains of fruits and 
vegetables from the hands, there

lemon should be a part of every kitch- 
en's equipment, for there is no mark 
of vegetable origin that cannot be 
removed by this simple agent. Lemons 
can be used like soap to the benefit 
of the skin at all times. 



Where one has Httle closet room, 
the following is an excellent method 
of making it count for more. Across 
from side to side put a pole. A 
broom handle may be cut to fit 
space. Over this, hangers keep gowns 
in better order than when hung from 
hooks. By this arrangement one can 
put twice as much in a closet, and 
keep everything in the best of condi- 
tion. Wire hangers may be bought 
at thirty cents a dozen, and, when 
covered with silk, scented or not, look 
pretty; but they preserve shape of 
coats and gown equally well if not 
padded. Dora May Morrell. 






A Novel " Grab " 

AT oiu^ last fair the **grab" was 
a very clever imitation of a soda 
fountain. It was placed in an alcove, 
and over the entrance hung this sign, 
"The Fountain of Youth." The foun- 
tain itself was just a big box, with its 
lid removed, standing on end on a 
white covered table. This box was 
covered with white tiled paper, and 
on the top stood several potted plants, 
with a mirror behind them. In front 
a number of large holes were bored, 
and over them projected pasteboard 
spouts covered with silver paper. The 
counter in front of the fountain held 
soda-water glasses, straws, a dish of 
lemons, and so on, while signs were 
hung around the walls, advertising 
the various five and ten cent drinks. 
At a little distance the illusion was 
perfect. Two persons managed the 
fountain. One took the money and 
held the glass under a spout, while 
the unseen assistant behind the box 



dropped into the tumbler a suitable 
parcel, five or ten cent, girl's or boy's^ 
as the case might be. 

A Church Calendar 

THREE years ago our parish grew 
tired of the annual fair. It meant 
a great deal of hard work, and the 
money retiuns were most unsatis- 
factory. The chiwch was compara- 
tively poor, and the financial prob- 
lem was a serious one. Finally, we 
tried the calendar plan, which made 
so small a demand on each member 
that every one could contribute to 
the support of the parish. The head 
of the Women's Guild was the **Year." 
She asked twelve other women to 
be ''Months," and each of them found 
four persons who would be ** Weeks." 
Every "Week" secured seven "Days." 
Each was to give ten cents a month. 
On the first day of the month each 
"Day" was requested to pay her dues 
to her "Week," who added her ten* 
cents, and handed the resulting eighty 
cents to her "Month" by the tenth 
of that month. The "Month" added 
her lo cents, and then gave $3.30^ 
to the "Year," who also gave ten cents. 
The exact, figures for a month are as 
follows: twelve "Months" at $3.30 
each, $39.60 plus ten cents from the 
"Year," $39.70, or for the whole 
twelve months of the year, $475.20. 

In asking people to join oiu* calendar, 
we promised that there should be no 
begging for a fair during the year of 
the calendar; and most of them were 
only too glad to escape the greater 
evil by this method. 

It is but fair to add that some mem- 
bers were tardy and irregular in their 
contributions, as might be expected. 
Still, the system has worked so well 
as a whole that on Jan. i, 1907, we 
shall begin on our fourth year under 
the calendar. Ours starts from the 
New Year; but, of course, that is not 
obligatory. Any other time would* 
really do as well.

Testing Water 

RECENTLY I was told (then tried) 
the following test, and thought, 
perhaps, it might interest your readers. 
If you are doubtful as to the purity 
of drinking water, draw a glass from 
the suspected well, spring, or faucet, 
drop in it a large lump of white sugar, 
and allow it to remain in a place of 
about 60® F. over night. In the morn- 
ing, if the water is pure, it will look 
perfectly clear ; but, if it be impure, it 
will have a cloudy, milky appearance, 
and you may beware of germs. Be 
sure to cover the glass. Never allow 
milk or drinking water to stand un- 
covered to catch the dust. Both milk 
and water absorb odors and imptui- 
ties very quickly, and are then unfit 
for use. In fact, a bucket of cold 
water placed in a closed fresh-painted 
room will remove the odor of turpen- 
tine entirely. 

Simple Little Helps 

NEXT time you have an attack of 
headache, neuralgia, ear or tooth 
ache, pain in the stomach, even a 
sprained ankle, and while you are 
waiting for the doctor to arrive, try 
hot-water applications. The very best 
way to do this is to put a piece of 
old flannel in a basin, potu" boiling 
water over it, and let it stand a couple 
of minutes. In the mean time lay 
a clean towel on the table, and with 
a stick (or any convenient article) 
lift the flannel out of the hot water 
onto the towel. Fold the towel over, 
then twist tightly to remove superflous 
water, and apply the flannel as quickly 
as possible to the afflicted part, cov- 
ering it with oiled silk to keep in heat 
and moisture. If oiled silk is not ob- 
tainable, try oiled paper. It will an- 
swer in cases of emergency, and is 
equally good to keep heat in poul- 
tices. Fomentations treated as above 
may be applied much hotter than in 
case you try to wring the flannel with 
the hands. 



Try breathing through the nose as 
a preventive of colds. Also avoid 
colds by keeping your rooms at an 
even temperature. 

Teach children to take pride in ' 
their hands by setting them the exam- 
ple. Provide the Uttle folk with a 
tray (or box) and a few little mani- 
cure tools. If well taken care of, the 
ugliest nails can be improved, and 
made really nice. The cuticle must 
be pushed back daily, immediately 
after the hands are washed and thor- 
oughly dried. It is best to use a soft 
towel, good toilet soap, and an orange- 
wood stick to push back the skin. 
The nails should never be cut. This 
makes them very brittle, and then 
they break so easily. Instead use a 
file. It takes a little longer, perhaps, 
but the result is much more satis- 
factory in the end. l. H. w. 

How to dry Berries 

BLACK raspberries or the purple 
Columbian berry are the best for 
this piu-pose. They should not be 
overripe. 

The fruit should be free from dust 
and gathered by clean hands, so that 
it need not be washed before drying. 

Look over carefully, and spread in 
layers, three berries deep, on earthen 
plates or granite tins. Set in the oven 
or on the back of the stove until brought 
to a scalding-point, then at once re- 
move to a place that is simply warm 
enough to keep the moisture slowly 
evaporating, but where there is no pos- 
sible danger of burning. Stir occa- 
sionally with a spoon. In twelve hotu's 
the fruit should be reduced to one- 
third its original bulk, when three 
plates may be put together, giving 
room for a fresh supply. 

It will take from thirty-six to forty- 
eight hours to remove all the moistiu^e. 
Then the berries will be ready to pack 
away. At the last the berries should 
be again brought to a scalding-point.

to insure freedom from insects. In 
doing this, watch constantly, lest the 
berries burn. 

Pack the fruit in small pails with 
tight covers, or baking-powder cans 
may be used. 

Before putting on the cover, spread 
over the top as many thicknesses of 
clean paper as will shut down with the 
cover, the edge showing below the 
cover when it is on firmly, so as to 
make it moth-proof. 

In a day or two take ofif the cover; 
and, if any moisture appears on the 
paper or sides of the pail, heat enough 
to remove it, and put on a dry paper. 
The dishes may be set in any dry place. 
Fruit dried in this way will keep for 
years; and, although an old-fashioned 
way, it is an agreeable change from 
ordinary canned and preserved fruits. 
It should be carefully washed in luke- 
warm water before using, and stewed 
for a long time in plenty of water, sugar 
to be added just before serving.

A SMALL boy translated these 
letters into the phrase, ** Refresh- 
ments served very promptly." But, 
then, small boys are apt to think of 
good things to eat, and desire them 
served as soon as possible. The cus- 
tomary letters are not always heeded 
as they should be. People forget that 
their hosts may, if regrets be received 
promptly, extend invitations to others, 
and that such failttre to reply may bar 
others from pleasiu-e in a true dog-in- 
the-manger manner, especially if the 
seats be counted for a musicale or if a 
house be small and the list of guests 
long. 

It is not alone the need to know how 
to cater well, though this is a main rea- 
son for the initials. In the matter of 
school receptions those who receive 
cards often lay them aside, and think 
of them only as a form of courtesy 



from a young lady, and that by and 
by in some letter to her mother they 
will express interest, and regret that 
thev could not attend. The fact is 
that at most schools the graduating 
class extends the invitations, which 
are often limited in number, and the 
class settles all bills. Whether their 
friends reply or not makes a difference 
upon each one's share of the bill; for 
unless notes declining the invitations are 
received, then the full price is paid for 
all on the list, as if they had attended. 

At the closing exercises of a large 
private school the graduating class 
sent out handsome cards for an es- 
pecial occasion to be followed by re- 
freshments. Instead of replying to 
the young ladies, one person wrote in 
the correct third person, but addressed 
it to the lady principal, whom she 
knew; and then, as if it were a per- 
sonal letter, she happened to think of 
a request from this same lady principal 
for a good recipe for brown bread, and 
so she added a postscript in off-hand 
fashion on the reverse side of the sheet, 
and appended to it her recipe for good 
brown bread. Whether it was to have 
the matter off her mind, to save a 
stamp, or to convey some useful in- 
formation in addition to what she 
thought needless formality between her 
self and the lady principal, or whether 
she feared the young ladies would not 
survive the summer without the knowl- 
edge of brown-bread making, was never 
explained. 

Lest jocosely inclined readers suggest 
that this woman was from New Eng- 
land, and all that was lacking was an- 
other recipe informing the girls how to 
bake beans, I will add that she was not 
from Boston nor New England.

Wiener Strudel (from a Hungarian 

Cook) 

Supplied by the Loring School 

SIFT one and one-half cups of flour 
on the moulding-board. Make a 
well in the centre. Put in one 
ounce of lard, yolk of an egg, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and water 
enough to "stick." Work all together 
hard. Then slap on the board (this 
is the same movement used in slap- 
ping Baba and French bread). Work 
and slap until the dough will not stick 
to the board. Heat a deep tin pan. 
Put it over the dough, and let it 
stand. Cover a long kitchen table 
with a cloth (white and clean), and 
sprinkle flour all over it. When the 
dough has risen (it takes fifteen or 
twenty minutes under the pan to 
rise), take it out, and pull and stretch 
gently with the hands in all direc- 
tions from the centre. Then place it 
on the middle of the table, and pull 
by the edges until it covers the table, 
and is as thin as a delicate skin. Sprin- 
kle with melted butter, and spread 
with the following filling. Cut off 
any thick edges of dough, if there are 
any. Fold over the edges from the 
ends and sides toward the centre by 
lifting the cloth (you can coax it 
gently into a S)rmmetrical roll). Roll 
from both ends toward the middle until 
they meet. If the roll is too long for 
the buttered pan, cut it. Bake thirty 
minutes. 

Filling for Strudel 
Quarter and core some apples. Slice 



them very thin, and spread over the 
whole surface of the dough, and over 
this sprinkle one cup of chopped nuts 
(pecans are good) and one cup of 
sugar. Sprinkle, when done, with pow- 
dered sugar.

Canning Red Raspberries 

FILL the jars with the fruit, shak- 
ing down well (but do not crush). 
Adjust covers and rubbers, and place 
in a kettle of cold water in the same 
manner as explained. Then bring to 
boiling-point, and boil until the steam 
will issue from the jar of fruit when 
opened. Lift from the kettle, and fill 
to the brim with a hot (boiling) syrup 
made in proportion of one cup of sugar, 
half a cup of water, and, /or a pint can of 
raspberries, add one tablespoonful of cur- 
rant juice. The currant juice gives the 
berries such a rich flavor that those 
canned without it seem flat in comparison. 
All kinds of berries canned in this 
way remain perfectly whole, and re- 
tain a fresh fruit flavor that is lacking

luncheon fixture. Let me emphasize 
the fact that we had delicious coffee. 
This leads me to add a word as to that 
beverage. Why cannot one obtain a 
cup of drinkable coffee in London? 
I have had served some of the queerest 
liquids, when I asked for coffee, that 
ever passed mortal lips. Chicory should 
be asked for, as fully two-thirds of that 
weed is used to one-third of the coffee 
berry. And the English people will 
tell you they prefer it that way. But 
the English are a tea-drinking nation, 
and they surely make up in the ex- 
cellence of that beverage for their 
failure in the other.

QuBRY 1 1 37. — Subscriber, New York City: 
Recipes for chicken and ham mousse, egg 
timbales with bread sauce, lemon dieese 
cakes, cheese sauce, and cheese balls." 

Ham Mousse 

Have a thick slice from the best side 
of the centre of a raw ham. Remove 
all fat and stringy portions, and let 
the ham soak overnight in cold water. 
Change the water once, at least, on 
leaving it for the night, and use a large 
quantity of water compared with the 
size of the piece of ham. Drain the 
ham, wipe dry, and scrape the pulp 
from the fibre with a sharp knife. 
There should be a generous half-pound 
of pulp. Eight ounces (one cup) is 
needed for the dish, and a small por- 
tion will not pass through the sieve, 
and needs be allowed for. Pound the 
ham pulp with a pestle in a mortar 
or wooden bowl. When smooth, add 
the beaten whites of two eggs, and 
potmd the whole tmtil again smooth. 
Have ready a sauce made of two table- 
spoonfuls, each, of butter and flour, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of salt 
and paprika, and one cup of chicken 
stock (broth seasoned with onion, car- 
rot, celery, bay leaf, etc.). When the 
sauce is cold, beat this smoothly into 
the ham mixtiu*e, and press the whole 
through a pur6e sieve. Beat in the 
yolks of two eggs, beaten very light, 
and one cup of cream, beaten firm. 
Add more seasoning, if needed, and 
turn the mixture into a thoroughly 
buttered mould. Cook, set on several 
folds of paper and sturounded with 
hot water, until firm to the touch 
(twenty-five or thirty minutes). Serve 
with a pint of sauce made of chicken

ceed. 

Egg Timbales 

Beat six eggs without separating 
the whites and yolks. Add a scant 
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, a 
teaspoonful of chopped parsley, twenty 
drops of onion juice, and one cup and 
a half of rich milk. Mix thoroughly, 
and pour into well-buttered timbale 
moulds. Cook, set on folds of paper, 
surrounded by hot water, until the 
centres are firm. Turn from the 
moulds onto a hot platter, and sur- 
roimd with 

Bread Sauce 

Put half a cup of fine bread crumbs 
from the centre of a stale loaf, a peeled 
onion into which six cloves have been 
pushed, half a teaspoonful, each, of 
salt and paprika, and one pint of milk 
over the fire in a double boiler. Cover, 
and let cook about one hotu*. Remove 
the onion and cloves. Add two tables 
spoonfuls of butter, and beat thor- 
oughly. Then poiu* over the timbales. 
Half a cup of coarse bread crumbs 
(centre of loaf), browned in three or 
four tablespoonfuls of butter made 
hot in a frying-pan, may be sprinkled 
over the whole. 

Lemon Cheese Cakes 

Press enough cottage cream, or 
NeuchAtel cheese, through a colander 
or potato ricer to make one cup and 
a half of cheese. Add one-third a cup 
of sugar, the grated rind and juice of 
a lemon, two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
one tablespoonful of melted butter, 
one-fourth a cup of sherry wine, and 
four eggs, beaten without separating 
the whites and yolks. At pleasure, 
half a cup of cturants and sliced citron 
may be added. Bake in very small 
tins, lined with rich pastry. Cream 
may be used instead of the wine, and 
pounded almonds instead of the lemon 
rind and juice. 



Lemon Cheese Cakes No. 2 

Put half a cup of butter, two cups 
of sugar, the grated rind and juice of 
three lemons, foiu: whole eggs and the 
yolks of two more, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt into a double boiler,, and 
stir and cook until the mixture becomes 
smooth and thickens to the consistency 
of honey. Store in fruit jars or jelly 
tumblers, or use at once. To use, 
reheat over hot water* add fine maca- 
roon or sponge cake crumbs to secure 
a thicker consistency, and turn into 
hot pastry, baked on small inverted 
tins. Prick the pastry before baking, 
that it may rise uniformly. 

Cheese Sauce 

(For boiled fish, macaroni, cauliflower, aspara- 
gus, etc., and for hominy, macaroni, and rice 

croquettes.) 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Cook in it a tablespoonful of flotir and 
one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of salt 
and paprika. Add one cup of milk 
or well-seasoned chicken or veal broth, 
and stir until boiling. Then set over 
hot water, and beat in from one-fourth 
to pne-half a pound of grated cheese. 
Add salt, mustard and cayenne, at pleas- 
iu*e. When the cheese is melted, beat 
in the yolk of an egg, and serve as soon 
as the egg is set. 

Cheese Balls 

Beat the whites of three eggs until 
dry. Then mix into them one-fourth 
a teaspoonful, each, of salt and paprika, 
mixed with one cup and a half of com- 
mon factory cheese (grated). Shape 
the mixture into small balls, roll in 
sifted cracker crumbs, and fry in deep 
fat to a delicate straw color. The 
balls will cook in about forty seconds. 
Drain on soft paper, and serve at once. 



Query 1138. — L. T., Funchal, Madeira: 
"Recipe for deviled chicken. Should think 
it no more difficult than potted meats which 
I now prepare. Also recipe for pin money 
mangoes." 



58 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



Deviled Chicken 

Prepare the same as potted chicken, 
seasoning very highly with cayenne, 
black pepper, and mustard. 

Melon Mangoes, Pin Money 

Style 

We are unable to give the exact 
recipe for these delicious pickles. Try 
putting up a few mangoes by this rec- 
ipe, then add to or take from the va- 
rious ingredients given, to secure a 
result more nearly in harmony with 
your idea of what the mangoes should 
be. We shall put up some of these 
pickles this season, and thereafter can 
give a more accurate recipe. Take 
any sort of melon, about two inches 
in length, and with a coltunn cutter 
(or, wanting this, use a sharp pen- 
knife) take out a roimd piece at the 
stem end, then remove the soft centre 
where the seeds are forming. Put the 
piece of melon removed from the end 
back in place, securing it with a bit 
of wooden tooth-pick. Make a brine 
of salt and water (a cup of salt to a 
gallon of water), and let the prepared 
melons remain in it over night. The 
next day drain several hottrs. Then 
remove the piece from the end, and 
fill the melons with the following mixt- 
ure, and set into an agate kettle. 
Prepare a syrup in the proportion of 
one pint of sugar to three pints of cider 
vinegar. Poiw this boiling hot over 
the melons. Let stand imtil next day. 
Then drain off the syrup, reheat, and 
pour it over the melons. Repeat this 
process three or four days. Then let 
the whole come to the boiling-point, 
and store in jars as canned fruit. 

Filling for Melon Mangoes 

For each eight or ten mangoes take 
one of the prepared melons. Chop 
rather line, then add rather less than 
the same bulk, each, of cleaned dried 
currants and mixed mustard and cel- 
ery seed. The seeds should first be 



covered with boiling water and left 
fifteen minutes. Then drain thor- 
oughly, and mix with the currants and 
chopped melon. When storing the 
mangoes in the jars, add about a dozen 
and a half of tiny red peppers to the 
vinegar in each jar. For a softer 
pickle, cook the mangpes in weak vine- 
gar before pouring the s)rrup over them. 



QuBRY 1 139. — Mrs. W. A. D., Baltimore, Md. : 
"Kindly repeat a recipe for 'cauliflower au 
gratin/ published some time ago in the 
magazine. The recipe is not given in your 
cook-book. Kindly state in which number 
of the magazine it was originally published." 

Baked Cauliflower 

Boil a cauliflower, taking care that 
it be rather tmder than over done. 
Trim the stalk so that the cauliflower 
will stand level. Do not remove the 
tender leaves. Put in a well-buttered 
baking-dish that may be sent to the 
table, and dust with salt and black 
pepper. Have prepared a cup of sauce 
made of chicken broth. Add two table- 
spoonfuls of thick cream and one- 
foiuth a cup of grated cheese (Ameri- 
can factory or Parmesan). Pour the 
sauce over the cauliflower to fill all 
the crevices. Sprinkle a layer of grated 
cheese over the whole, and bake in 
a rather quick oven ten or fifteen 
minutes. Substitute milk for chicken 
stock, if desired. This recipe was 
published in the August-September 
niunber for 1900. Buttered cracker 
crumbs sprinkled over the layer of 
cheese would improve the dish, and 
also change the name to cauliflower 
au gratin.

She Quit 

But it was a Hard Pull 

It is hard to believe that coffee will 



put a person in such a condition as it 
did a woman of Apple Creek, Ohio. 
She tells her own story : — 

*'I did not believe coffee caused my 
trouble, and frequently said I liked it 
so well I would not quit drinking it, even 
if it took my life ; but I was a misera- 
ble sufferer from heart trouble and 
nervous prostration for four years. 

* ' I was scarcely able to be around at 
all. Had no energy, and did not care 
for anything. Was emaciated, and 
had a constant pain around my heart, 
until I thought I could not endure it. 
For months I never went to bed ex- 
pecting to get up in the morning. I 
felt as though I was liable to die any 
time during the night. 

** Frequently I had nervous chills, 
and the least excitement would drive 
sleep away, and any little noise would 
upset me terribly. I was gradually 
getting worse, until, finally, cne day 
it came over me; and I asked myself. 
What is the use of being sick all the 
time and buying medicine so that I 
can indulge myself in coffee ? 

*'So I thought I would see if I could 
quit drinking coffee, and got some 
Postum Food Coffee to help me quit. 
I made it strictly according to direc- 
tions, and I want to tell you that change 
was the greatest step in my life. It 
was easy to quit coffee because I had 
the Postum which I like better than 
I Uked the old coffee. One by one the 
old troubles left, until now I am in 
splendid health, nerves steady, heart 
all right, and the pain all gone. Never 
have any more nervous chills, don't 
take any medicine, can do all my 
housework, and have done a great deal 
besides. 

"Mv sister-in-law, who visited me 
this summer, had been an invalid for 
some time, much as I was. I got her 
to quit coffee and drink Postum. She 
gained five pounds in three weeks, and 
I never saw such a change in anv one's 
health." 

"There's a reason."

Arc You 
Sure Your 
Vinegar is Pure? 

In no other article that goes on the table 
is there so much dangerous adult^ation as 
in ordinary vinegar. 

And yet the amount of vinegar used in 
any one home is so small that every family 
can afford the finest vinegar made. 

Pure Malt Vinegar 

— the only vinegar of this kind made in the 
United States— is without question the 
purest, most delicious, most healthful vine- 
gar that can be produced. Indeed, it is re- 
c<^nized as the standard by the Gov^nm^t 
pure-food authorities. 

Brewed from selected barley malt by a 
most exact process, it combines with all the 
healthful properties of the grain a flavor 
of rare pungency that makes it invaluable 
for salads and table uses. 

Your grocer sells Hdnz Pure Malt Vine- 
gar in sealed bottles. Include a bottle in 
your next order; if it isn't the finest that 
ever came to yotu* table the grocer will re- 
fund your money.

Query 1142. — Subscriber: "Recipes for 
dis)ies suitable for invalids." 

Dishes Suitable for Invalids 
This query is rather indefinite; for 
the kind of dish needed by a consump- 
tive patient, a dish containing cream, 
oil, or some other form of fat, would 
certainly not be the one to prescribe 
to a person with deranged Uver or 
kidneys. Asparagus could probably be 
eaten by most convalescent patients. 
If the digestion be normal, a consump- 
tive might have it dressed with any 
of the sauces usually accompanying 
the dish. The other class of patients 
designated should confine themselves 
to simply a seasoning of salt, with, 
perhaps, in some cases, a suspicion of 
butter. For the diabetic, yolks of 
eggs in profusion should enrich the 
sauce, and butter should not be spared. 
On account of the seeds, strawberries 
cannot be eaten by those whose di- 
gestion is delicate. For these crush 

(See page xiv.) 



Bread Dyspepsia 

The Digesting Element left out 

Bread Dyspepsia is common. It 
affects the bowels, because white bread 



is nearly all starch; and starch is di- 
gested in the intestines, not in the 
stomach proper. 

Up under the shell of the wheat 
berry. Nature has provided a curious 
deposit, which is turned into diastase 
when it is subjected to the saUva and 
to the pancreatic juices in the human 
intestines. 

This diastase is absolutely necessary 
to digest starch and turn it into grape 
sugar, which is the next form ; but that 
part of the wheat berry makes dark 
flour, and the modem miller cannot 
readily sell dark flour, so Nature's 
valuable digester is thrown out, and 
the human system must handle the 
starch as best it can, without the help 
that Nature intended. 

Small wonder that appendicitis, peri- 
tonitis, constipation, and all sorts of 
trouble exist when we go so contrary 
to Nature's law. The food experts that 
perfected Grape-nuts Food, knowing 
these facts, made use in their experi- 
ments of the entire wheat and barley, 
including all the parts, and subjected 
them to moisture and long-continued 
warmth, which allows time and the 
proper conditions for developing the 
diastase outside of the human body. 

In this way the starchy part is trans- 
formed into grape sugar in a perfectly 
natural manner, without the use of 
chemicals or any outside ingredients. 
The little sparkUng crystals of grape 
sugar can be seen on the pieces of 
Grape-nuts. This food, therefore, is 
naturally pre-digested ; and its use 
in place of bread will quickly correct 
the troubles that have been brought 
about by the too free use of starch in 
the food, and that is very common 
in the human race to-day. 

The effect of eating Grape-nuts ten 
days or two weeks, and the discontinu- 
ance of ordinary white bread, is very 
marked. The user will gain rapidly in 
strength and physical and mental 
health.

Book Reviews 



The Up-to-Date Waitress. By 
Janet M. Hill, author of "Salads, 
Sandwiches, and Chafing-dish Dain- 
ties," "Practical Cooking and Serv- 
ing," etc. i2mo. Illustrated. Cloth, 
extra. $1.50, Boston: Little, Brown 
&Co. 

The readers of this magazine have 
already had an opportunity to read 
some of the papers that compose this 
volume, as they have appeared in suc- 
cessive issues of the magazine in the 
past year or two. The author has pre- 
pared additional chapters, and added 
more than fifty illustrations. These 
are now combined in an attractive, 
tasteful volume, with a handsome or- 
namental cover. 

The book, we believe, is the most 
complete and serviceable that has been 
written on this subject. All the various 
duties of the skilled waitress are treated 
in detail. The care of the dining-room, 
the setting of tables, and the launder- 
ing of table linen, the serving of meals, 
the preparation of certain dishes, the 
proper service of wines, etc., are not 
only carefully described, but also these 
topics are appropriately illustrated by 
half-tone engravings of the very things 
described. 

The book should be of immediate and 
more than passing interest, not only to 
waitresses, but to schools of domestic 



science and in every household where 
maids are employed. 

The International Cook-book. By 
Alexander Filippini. 8vo. Washa- 
ble binding. Price S4.80, net. New 
York: Doubleday, Page & Co. 
This is a large, comprehensive, and 
valuable work. In some respects it 
is unique. The author made a special 
trip around the world for the purp',se 
of collecting material for this book, 
and he has thus enriched his work by 
hundreds of recipes never before pub- 
lished in English. There are nearly 
3,500 recipes in all. These are arranged 
in diary form, with a menu for each 
meal of every day in the year. The 
menus are conservative, and chosen 
with rare taste and judgment. The 
recipes are explicit. The memoranda 
for the meals of each day in the year 
are carefully calculated to be sufficient 
in quantity for six people, — an average 
that can be easily increased or dimin- 
ished. 

The author is an expert cook and a 
cuhnary authority. His book is en- 
tirely practical and reliable. It must 
prove to be an invaluable storehouse of 
information and helpfulness to cook 
and housekeeper. A genuine and sen- 
sible contribution to the art of cook- 
ery.

BoYViLLE. By John E. Giinckel.

75 c-nts.net. Toledo, Ohio: The 

Toledo Newsboys' Association. 

This book is of interest to boys: it 
is also of concern to all those who have 
dealings with boys. It gives the result 
of one man's interest in the boys of his 
own city, — a man who beheves in a 
method of dealing with boys quite 
other than that of force. In short, 
he beUeves that "the best way to correct 
wrong-doing is to prevent it, to warn 
a boy against the evil vices that tend 
to his ruin in Uter years, and that one 
way to prevent crime is to reward 
virtue." 

Those -who have noted the name of 
Hon. Ben. B. Undsey, of Denver, Col., 
and the accounts of his ways in the 
Juvenile Court of that city, will get 
an inkling of the method herein de 
tailed, for his success has been along 
the same self-governing plan as that of 
the Boyville Association of Toledo. 

The book deals with a problem vital, 
far-reaching, — one that confronts the 
thoughtful, philanthropic, patriotic 
citizen in every community of the land. 

President Roosevelt wrote an intro- 
duction to the book.

What to 
Eat in Hot 
Weather 

Q the summer months this is a problem that 
} be solved almost daily, and many a house- 
T will welcome a su^estion, if only for an 
ional meaL 

ot meats on a hot day are both unhealthy and 
undesirable. Cold meats and salads are far preferable, but even 
cold meat means cooking, and a hot fire is just what you most 
want to avoid. 

But there is a very simple way of escape, and here it is : 
Kat Squire's Boiled Ham. 

The cooldng is done in our immense packing plant at Cam- 
bridge, Mass. Only the finest hams are used, and we have 
thousands to select from. The curing is by our own private 
process, used by us for three generations, and the cooking is done 
amid surroundings as inviting as in your own kitchen. 

Each ham is double-wrapped in air-tight, germ-proof parch- 
ment paper, and you can buy from your dealer either a whole 
ham or a single slice. The meat is moist, sweet, tender, and of 
a flavor quite unlike that of ordinary ham. A sandwich made 
with it is good beyond description. 

Don't fail to try this ham. If it happens that your dealer 
does not sell it, please send us his name, and wc will see that 
you are supplied. Our name is on every wrapper,

Outdoor Mushroom Culture 

Few Places in the Country nhere it ii 
Possible Commercially 

After a thorough investigation of 
the possibilities of outdoor mushroom 
culture, the Bureau of Plant Industry 
announces that in this country few 
localities exist where this can be made 
commereially possible, owing to the 
wide range of temperature and large 
variation in moisture conditions that 
normally occur. It is thought that 
the only favorable regions for mush- 
room culture out-of-doors are in Cali- 
fornia, at Eureka and San Francisco. 
One of the results of the Department 
of Agriculture's study of the mush- 
room industry has been the develop- 
ment of a new and scientific method 
of producing mushroom spawn, which 
is now employed by a number of Amer-

Her Thought 



The castle dung to the mountain, 
And looked on the vale below. 

Beneath, it was green with oUves; 
Above, it was white with snow. 

She loalced on castle and mountain. 
And olives and snow and sides. 

Till, bom of her maiden fancy, 
A thought gleamed bright in her eyes. 

I benl to hear her express it, 
Expectant and breathing hard. 

She murmured, "Wouldn't that make a 
Remarkable poMal card?"

The Secretin 
is in 

the Jar 

The real secret of successful 
home preserving lies in the jar. No 
matter how correct the recipe, or 
how faithfully followed, loss of 
good fruit and vegetables is certain 
unless you use a perfect jar. The 
ATIAS Hun w a perfect jar— xo use 
it is to insure the keeping of eveiy

which you prepare for preserving. 

Don't ask your grocer merely for 
a Mason jar— Mason is tiot enough. 
There are good and bad Masons, 
because ihe name is no longer pro- 
tected, and any manufacturer can 
make Mason jars. Remember that

More Eating than Seeing 
George Ade, the humorist and play- 
wright, told a story recently of a farmer 
who went to a lai^ dty to see the 
sights. The rural visitor engaged a 
room at a hotel, and, before retiring, 
asked the clerk about the hours for 
dining. 

"We have breakfast from ax to 
eleven, dinner from eleven to three, 
and supper from three to eight," ex- 
plained the clerk. 

"Wa-al, say," inquired the fanner, 
in surprise, "what time air I goin' ter 
git to see thertown?" — Judge. 



A gentleman went into a restaurant 
and ordered a plate of soup. After 
a long wait, the waiter brought it in, 
and placed it before the diner. After 
examining it, he said to the waiter, 
' ' What do you call this stuff ? " " Bean 
soup, sir," replied the waiter. "Yes, 
I know it's been soup; but what is it 
now?"— Ttftwfa . 

Marjorie had been given some hard 
peppermint candies; and, after hold-

she ran to her mother, and cried, "O 
mother, I swallowed that candy!" 
"Never mind," said her mother, "it 
will not hurt you." "Yes," I know, 
said Marjorie; "but I lost the use of 
it." — Selected.

"For the 
Love of 
the 
Wheat" 



The "June Bride," radiant in roses and wedding gown, is the 
poet's picture of perfect bliss. Her cup of happiness is tilled to the 
brim and running over. All the world tosses bouquets at her feel and 
wishes her "bon voyage." Life seems to her one glad, sweet song. 

Into this dream of bliss there steals some day the demon of indi- 
gestion — and then domestic discord: A little bad cooking and a 
little indigestion will sow dragons' teeth in Fields Elysian. 

Happy the June bride who knows Shredded Wheat, — the 
purest product of sunshine and soil, ready-cooked, ready to serve, a 
delight to the palate, a soothing comforter to jaded stomachs. It is 
made of the choicest wheat, cleaned, cooked, drawn into fine, porous 
shreds, and baked. It is not only delicious for breakfast with milk or 
cream, but with it many dainty and palatable dishes may be made in 
combination with strawberries, creamed vegetables, or meats. 

Triscuit is the Shredded Whole Wheat Wafer. Better than 
bread for toast. Delicious with butter, cheese, or preserves.

Nothing else will take the place of 
good cheer and laughter at meals or 
any other time in the home. There 
is a vital connection between ami- 
ability and digestion, between good 
cheer and assimilation. Laughter is 
the best friend the liver has, and de- 
pression, or melancholia, its worst en- 
emy. Numerous experiments have 
shown that mirth and cheerfulness 
stimulate the secreUon of the gastric 
juice, and are powerful aids to diges- 
tion. Vet. knowing this, many of us 
sit as gloomy and absorbed at the table 
as at a funeral. In many homes 
scarcely a word is spoken at meals, out- 
side of requests for an article of food. 

The meal hour ought to mean some- 
thing besides supplying a mere animal 
function. The bell which calls the fam- 
ily to the table ought to be the signal 
for a good time generally, when alt 
cares should be thrown off and every- 
body appear at his best. It ought to 
signalize the time for mirth and laugh- 
ter. It ought to be looked forward 
to by the members of the family as 
the recess or nooning is looked for- 
ward to by pupils in school, as a let-up 
from the strenuous life. ^Orworf Swell

Professor Maria Mitchell was once 
ordered beer by her physician as a 
tonic. On the way to visit her sister, 
Mrs. Joshua Kendall, of Cambridge. 
Mass., she stopped at a saloon (it was 
before the no-license regime), and 
bought a bottle of beer, which she 
asked her brother-in-law to open for 
her. The Mitchell family spoke the 
'"plain" language among themselves. 
' ' Where did thee get it, Maria ? " 
questioned her sister. "At the saloon 
on the comer," replied Miss Mitchell, 
serenely. '"Why. Maria, doesn't thee 
know respectable women don't go into 
such places?" "Oh." said Miss Mitch- 
ell, in the manner of one who has done 
all that could be required, "I told the 
man he ought to be thoroughly ashamed 
of his traffic."

DufTy's Apple Juice, 1842 

It has long been known that the 
apple contains all of the essential ele- 
ments of food. The free use of apples 
is reccmmended in the best worics on 
hygiene. Physicians have urged the 
eating of apples at night, because they 
supply food that is easily digested and 
allay hunger during the many hours 
of ^eep. 

If the juice of apples be expressed 
when the fruit is fresh, little lemains 
but ash, the juice containing all of 
the essential elements of nourishing 
food. Duffy's Apple Juice, 1842, con- 
tains these elements. Without alco- 
hol, the juice is rendered pure and 
wholesome by clarifying, sterilizing, 
and carbonating. It is agreeable to 
the most delicate stomach. 

An eminent medical authority says 
of this product: "I find your Apple 
Juice to contain malic add, acetic 
add, glycerine, potash, lime, and mag- 
nesia, — all present in small quanti- 
ties, but in a natural union so perfect 
as to produce an ideal, non-alcoholic 
beverage. These are the elements upon 
which the brain, the bones, and the 
muscles are nourished. Duffy's Apple 
Juice, 1842, Supphes the blood with a 
greater abundance of life's actual needs 
than any other of the fluid products 
of the garden or orchard." No other 
beverage is so agreeable to the palate 
and the stomach as Duffy's Apple Juice, 
1842. Carbonating this product im- 
parts UveUness and sparkle that are 
delectable. 

The processes employed in the pro- 
duction of Duffy's Apple Juice, 1842,, 
have overcome every difficulty, pre- 
serving the indescribable flavor of the 
apple in a clarified beverage, without

Greek Bakers change Fuel 

New Bread-making Methods result in 
General Saving 

At th-' suggestion of the Princess 
Sophia the ancient custom of baking 
bread in Greece is being discontinued, 
and the ovens are being remodelled 
on a more modem plan. In the old 
ovens a Are of branches is kindled in 
the compartment where the bread is 
baked, and one of ordinary wood in 
that beneath. When the oven is suffi- 
ciently heated, the brushwood and 
cinders are raked out, and the bread 
put in in its place. The Princess is 
president of the Society for the Pro- 
tection of Forests, and it is in the in- 
terest of this society that her royal 
highness has labored to substitute 
coke and other fuel for wood. There 
are in Athens alone about 200 bakers' 
ovens, and at least 25 of them have 
already been made over. The bakers 
have been jjersuaded to this step by 
arguments of economy. By the old 
system 80 cents' worth of wood was 
required to bake 700 pounds of bread, 
while the necessary amount of coke 
can be purchased for 40 cents. The 
bakers pay for the coke about i cent 
for 2.82 pounds.

The Name of Mennen 
is associated with toilet powder as 
no other name ever has been, because 
its perfect purity has set a standard for 
the world. It is known the world over, 
and is used with coniidence wherever 
it is known. In order that the purity 
of the powder may be pro(ected, and 
Mennen's box be a guarantee of Men- 
nen's Powder inside, Mennen's Borated 
Talcum is now put up in a box thai locks. 
It locks the powder in, and locks the pi- 
rates out. It is a box that can not be 
refilled without mutilating the package. 

Mennen's Borated Talcum has won 
the esteem of those who buy it and the 
trade who supply it by its perfect pu- 
rity and absolute uniformity. In the 
nursery it is supreme, because it is sani- 
tary as well as soothing. For the chaf- 
ing of children, nettle-rash, prickly heat, 
etc., it is healing as well as comforting. 

Mennen's Borated Talcum claims the 
first place on every toilet table by rea- 
son of its multifold usefulness and its 
absolute reliability. Its superiority 
is vouched for by leading medical au- 
thorities. 

People who judge powder by the 
price, and think it's better because it 
costs more, would be surprised to know 
that many of the powders which sell 
so high cost the dealers only half what 
Mennen's Borated Talcum costs. 

For this reason imitations are pushed 
and forced on you by dealers because 
their profit on them is much larger than 
on the genuine article. Purchasers of 
Mennen's Borated Talcum, the origi- 
nal, have absolute protection against 
fraud and . imitation in the new noti- 
retillable box. If it's Mennen's Box, 
it's Mennen's Powder. If it's Mennen's 
Powder, it's the best that's made.

It is too valuable, too dainty, too fragile to be cleansed with any 
other than Ivory Soap. 

The same lemark holds good in the case of a hundred other 
articles — colored goods, wash silks, lawns, dimities, curtains, etc. 
The safest, best, and only right way to launder them is with Ivory 
Soap. 

Ivory Soap — 99''5^o Per Cent. Pure. 



For all Times 

Indoors when you are tired 
and hungry; 

Outdoors, after the romp, the 
run; 

When the blood leaps in the 
veins and it must have food to 
keep it red and firm, then —

are what you need. 

For the dining-room, or the pic-

since they are made of the best. 

Nothing so varied, since there 
are 2 1 kinds to choose from. 

Nothing so quick, since all you 
need do is

VOICES OF NATURE 

By Lucia W. Eames 

I list to the wind soft sighing 

Through leaves of the pine-tree tall, 

And, deep in the heart of the wildwood. 

To the pewee*s plaintive call ; 

To the whip-poor-will's low moaning 

Across the fields at night. 

When the last bright hue of sunset 

Is fading from our sight. 

I hark to the weeping of waters 

Shed on a thirsty land. 

And, oft, to the dull boom of breakers 

Upon the white sea-sand. 

To wind, to wave, and to bird-song. 

To flutter of leaves in the fall. 

But, ah, in my heart there is sounding 

The saddest refrain of all.

Newton Hospital, Musachusclts 



A Modern Hospital Kitchen 

By Mary M. Riddle 



IT not infrequently happens that 
that which is of the most vital 
importance is last to receive at- 
tention. 

It is too often the case that the 
householder builds and equips every 
other part of his house, and puts what 
remains of good or ill into his kitchen. 
A generous benefactor of a hospital 
naturally considers the gift of an elab- 
orate operating room, with its ornate 
display of ^ss and brass and marble, 
or laboratories where scientific re- 
searches may be carried on, or memorial 
window^ "to 'commemorate the work 
and influence of a friend or relative, 



before the domestic needs of the in- 
stitution. 

The Newton Hospital was no ex- 
ception to the genera! rule. -For many 
years it expanded and enlarged and 
extended its work in all departments 
save the domestic. Its kitchen, which 
was built to accommodate the work for 
a family of twenty, was compelled 
many times to provide for one hundred 
and twenty. 

It remained for the women of Newton, 
with a characteristic ability for details, 
to discover the need, and at once 
procure means of relief, to the end that 
we have to-dav the Harriet Gould 



Exterior View of the Kitchen 



One or the StorerooTns 



A Modern Hospital Kitchen 



63 



Paine Domestic Building, containing a 
model kitchen, which, ovring to the 
architects and the Ladies' Hospital Aid 
Association, will be sufficient to meet 
the needs of the hospital for many 
future years. 

Owing to the topography of the land 
and the location of adjoining buildings, 
it seemed a problem to so place it that 
it should in no way overshadow the 
hospiital wards or have its odors wafted 
into them by the prevailing winds. By 
reason of much study on the part of 
those having the matter in charge 
(architects and others), these two great 
dangers were overcome, and the kitchen 
stands as an emblem of modern skill in 
that respect. 

Its greatest length being from north- 
east to south-west, its position is just 
right for the most perfect ventilation, 
which is further secured by the monitor 
roof having on each side nine windows 



that may be opened to an angle of 
thirty degrees, thus giving a perfect 
outlet for the accumulation of vapors 
and heavily loaded air. 

The constructors believed that they 
must build to meet the requirements of 
the present time, when a knowledge of 
hygiene is possessed by all classes, and 
when even laws make it obligatory that 
foods be prepared under the most 
sanitary conditions. They, therefore, 
provided that the interior walls should 
be of tiled brick, which are non-absorb- 
ent and as easily cleansed as any 
piece of china ; that the floor should be 
of slate tiles, set so closely together in 
cement that it is impossible for moisture 
to penetrate; that there should be a 
slight incline in the floor toward a 
perfect drain which carries off water 
used for cleansing the floor as well as 
condensed steam from the steam kettles ; 
that all corners should be rounded and 



Interior or Kitchen showing Ranges 



«4 



The Boston Cooktng-School Magazine 



no angles or ledges left for the collection 
of dust and dirt; that there should be 
many windows, giving opportunity for 
sunshine to enter every nook and comer, 
with the result that nothing can be 
hidden; that partitions should not ex- 
tend quite to the ceiling, thus providing 
further for ventilation and a free cir- 
culation of air; that entrance and exit 
should be easy by means of doors well 
placed ; that perfect sanitation should be 
possible by reason of the best and most 
carefully considered open plumbing. 

Under the same roof and immediately 
adjoining the kitchen, but separated 
from it by one of the lower partitions, 
is the bakery, containing the large oven, 
where are baked all the bread and 
other articles of food used by the hos- 
pital proper as well as by the contagious 
department. It is known as a portable 
oven, with all the advantages of an 
old-fashioned brick oven, but costing 



only about one-half as much and pos- 
sessing some qualities decidedly prefer- 
able to those of a brick oven. It stands 
about two feet from the floor, and thus 
allows an opportunity for cleanliness 
beneath it and all around it. 

One prominent feature of this do- 
mestic building is the scullery, opening 
out of the kitchen, where all the rougher 
work may be done. Here are sinks for 
washing vegetables, a motor for freezing 
ice-cream, and the same possibilities for 
fresh air and sunlight as are found else- 
where. 

The kitchen furnishings and special 
appointments are the simplest possible. 
Everything here found was placed here 
with a due regard for convenience and 
sanitation. 

There are no cupboards where ac- 
cumulation of any kind may be hidden. 
There is one small cupboard, where such 
articles as ought not to be exposed to 



A Modern Hospital Kitchen

the light are kept, and there are a few 
small drawers for linen. The kitchen 
utensils that cannot be hung upon a 
rack are placed upon an open cup- 
board, which is made of iron rods enam- 
elled white. Upon this open cupboard 
are kept such utensils as mi Ik- cans, tea- 
pots, coffee-pots, pitchers, plates, etc. 

The range stands away from the 
wall near themiddle of the floor and in 
line with the steam kettles, so that the 
same hood covers all and the same vent- 
pipe ventilates all. A short experience 
with a range thus placed proves its 
value. It is approachable from either 
side, and the oven doors may be opened 
from either side. 

The refrigerators, three in number, 
constitute the end of the building, and 
are so constructed as to permit a free 
circulation of cold air in eachfrom the 
1 ice chamber, and, yet, not to 



allow a mingling of the air in one with 
that of another. In this way it is 
possible to keep butter and milk sepa- 
rated from meat or any miscellaneous 
collection of food; and the size of the 
refrigerator gives opportunity for storage 
in larger quantities than heretofore, 
and is thereby a means of economy. 

In this kitchen building the hospital 
feels that it has one of the best and most 
efficient means of promoting the welfare 
of the sick who give themselves to its 
care; for we are taught that, "of all the 
means at the command of the physician 
in the treatment of disease, none stands 
higher than a properly selected and 
carefully prepared diet." And surely 
in this kitchen, so adequate as to con- 
veniences for the accomplishment of 
work under the most favorable hygienic 
and sanitary conditions, we should, 
with a proper understanding of food

values and a wise discrimination in 
their selection, be able to meet the 
requirements. 

The kitchen makes the seventeenth 
in the group of the Newton Hospital 
buildings. To many readers of this 
magazine the word "hospital" is not in- 
viting, but suggests operating rooms, 
large cheerless wards, and other feat- 
ures which do not attract. 



In the Newton Hospital it has been 
constantly in mind to furnish a home 
for the sick, to provide quiet surround- 
ings, separate buildings, and every 
facility and convenience needed for 
those who are sick and for those 
who care for the sick. The buildings 
are located on high, dry land in one 
of the most attractive suburbs of 
Boston. 



Twilight Song 



By Eugene C. Dolson 



Now the long, long day is dun< 
Slowly down the west 

Sinks the red and rayiess sun; 

Insect voices, one by one, 

Have their even-song begun,— 
'Tis the hour of rest. 



Sweet forgetfulness will creep 

O'er us by and by. 
Dreamland fancies softly steep 
Weary eyes in peaceful sleep, 
"While the stars in silence keep 

Watch from out the sky. 



The Last of Pea-time 



By Mrs. Charles Norman 



IT was the first garden the Thomp- 
sons had ever had, and though, as 
they said themselves, there were 
many gardens just as good, still no one 
could remember a better one. 

In truth, this was the only garden 
the Thompsons had ever seen, and 
they were to be congratulated upon 
their ability to estimate it so fairly; 
for it was, without doubt, a good gar- 
den. The beans had **come on" by 
the Fourth of July, which was as early 
as any of the neighbors had beans. 
The peas had been plentiful, — ^indeed, 
there were ten times as many as the 
Thompsons could possibly consume,, 
though they were, as the gardener 
said, * 'quite a pea family." Every 
radish had come up. Bach was ex- 
actly two inches from its neighbor, and 
the rows were fifteen inches apart. Mrs. 
Thompson had done the measuring. 
She was very particular about such 
things. If the matter had been left 
to Mr. Thompson or the * 'man, " the 
result would have been quite different. 
The tomatoes did not bear much fruit, 
but they were beautiful plants; and, 
when all the rest of the garden was in 
a state of immaturity, they kept up 
the family's courage, and so were 
counted successful, even if they had 
not fulfilled the promises of youth. 

There was an sesthetic side to this 
garden, too. A stately row of sun- 
flowers served as a wall on all four 
sides, and one long, rectangular space 
was given up to flowers, new-fashioned 
and old-fashioned. 

Mr. Thompson had invited all his 
friends from town out to see his gar- 
den, but by some perversity of fate 
every one had waited till so late in 
summer that the glory of that plot 
of ground was gone and there was ab- 
solutely nothing left but sunflowers. 



If the town people had come out 
when they were asked, they might 
have carried home lettuce by the peck, 
to say nothing of peas and peas and 
peas, — ^for peas were bestowed upon 
all travelers who chanced to pass that 
way. There were peas for the lowly 
and peas for the mighty; and, when 
the harvest was passed and the sum- 
mer ended, there were rows of peas, 
untouched, drying up with their first 
fruit upon them. 

The city people did not dream what 
they were missing. A garden cannot 
always be fresh and charming and full 
of peas. Radishes cannot stand for- 
ever two inches apart. Those that 
are tmused will just lie down and go 
to seed. Potato tops will turn brown 
and wither, flowers will pass into a 
state of decline, and weeds will take 
advantage of the general sickliness 
and get possession of everything. 

However, weeds were not the only 
crop that was coming on now. The 
children had usurped one spot which 
was shaded part of the day by an old 
tree; for children, like weeds, never 
have room enough, and always spread 
out when a clearing is made. 

They had carried to their retreat 
all manner of things, chief of which was 
a' table upon which refreshments were 
served when food of any kind could be 
obtained. The birds soon discovered 
where fragments were to be found, 
and chipping sparrows came thither 
in such friendly fashion that the chil- 
dren quite forgot themselves and began 
catering to the birds. A large pan of 
water that served for drinking and 
bathing was put up in a crotch of the 
apple-tree, fat meat was tied to the 
branches, and the table below was 
spread with goodies. Cats were vio- 
lently excluded. The children them-

selves retired to a near-by stump to 
watch proceedings, and visitors of 
human kind were permitted to enter 
that part of the garden only upon con- 
dition that they sit motionless and 
speechless during the interim of their 
call. 

For a time the garden was a feeding 
place for a large number of birds. 
Then came the season of stillness and 
shyness. Three — only three — interest- 
ing products remained in the Thomp- 
son garden. The goldfinches sang, the 
sunflowers bloomed, and the children 
watched. Sometimes the boy nodded 
a little when entertainment lagged. 
Then again he was all glee, and could 
hardly keep from running after the 
mischievous father goldfinch. 

Never a Sunday passed now but 
somebody came from the city to see 
the Thompson garden. It was em- 
barrassing enough, but, when Major 
Hook's automobile was seen coming 
up the driveway, the situation became 
specially trying, for he shouted, *' Hello, 
Thompson, I've come to see that gar- 
den." 

The children were, however, equal 
to the occasion, and almost before the 
* *good-moming" was said the visitor 
and the family were conducted to the 
observation point, and with pride, 
pomp, and mysterious ceremony they 
were grouped around the stump and 
told to keep perfectly still. 

To the major, this solemn silence 
was a great joke, and he could not in 
the least understand why growing 
vegetables should require such peculiar 
sacrifices; but, whatever it might 
mean, the children were in earnest. So 
he maintained his peace. 

**The birds!" whispered the little 
girl. **Look!" — and the goldfinches 
passed like flickering sunlight, from one 
tall sunflower to another, repeating 
their * 'Dearie !" '*Sweet!" so continu- 
ally that the beholders became inter- 
ested at once. By some good fortune 



two of the birds had brought thither 
their babies, the dearest little creattu'es 
imaginable, who sat upon a sunflower 
and were fed its seed. The great plant 
swayed in the sunshine, the greens, 
browns, and yellows of the gorgeous 
blossoms, matching the greens, browns, 
and yellows of the birds, producing a 
perfect symphony of color. As the 
birds moved from one stmflower to the 
next, it was by a dipping flight, and it 
seemed as if the air were festooned 
with these entrancing hues. Yet, as 
pretty as the pageant was, it appealed 
more to the heart than to the eye, for 
the adult birds led their young ones 
along in the most enticing way, skil- 
fully cracking the seed, dropping the 
husks, and putting the kernels into the 
gaping mouths. At length, as if to 
crown the performance. Father Gold- 
finch, too proud and happy to contain 
himself longer, left his task, threw back 
his jauntily-capped head, and sang his 
wildest, longest, sweetest song. The 
major, weary of city life, its hurly- 
burly and materialism, stared straight 
at the feathered musician, and listened. 
As if out of appreciation for such 
marked attention, the goldfinch came 
nearer and resumed his ecstatic warble. 
It was a moment of enchantment for 
the major, and from that time the 
Thompson' garden became to him a 
never-to-be-forgotten place. 

*'By Jove!" said he, as the song 
ceased. ' 'I wish you had told me 
what it was like. I should have been 
out long ago. Trained canaries in a 
garden! How did you ever manage 
it?" 

As he started home, he began hum- 
ming to himself, absent-mindedly, 



If 



Mistress Mary, quite contrary, 
How does your garden grow?" 



Then, by way of answering and com- 
pleting his own tune, he sang, 

"With Goldfinches sweet, at diildren's feet, 
And sunflowers all in a row." 



Beneficence 

By Harriette Robinson Shattuck 



Why are th^ flowers so varied, 
And not just red and blue? 

Why are the stars in myriad^ 
When we only see a few? 

Why rainbows in the sunrise, 

When dull, plain lines would serve? 

Such limitless profusion 
For the little we deserve? 



For ourselves, — we build a doll's house 1 

A Universe is given ! 
And, spite of earthly failure. 

There's promise true of Heaven. 

Ah ! why indeed, luch bounty 
Showered on us from Above? 

When justice owes us nothing, 
Why this imbounded love ? 



Our Father, in Thy mercy 

Lead us to understand 
This beneficent bestowal 

As the beckoning of Thy hand.

Possibilities

NATION of dyspeptics?" said 
a famous physician the other 
day. * *We have earned the 
title, I admit. The worst sinners, it 
is said, make the best saints, you know, 
and oiu" o.wn dietetic transgressions 
began to bring us to our senses as far 
back as the early forties, and that Amer- 
ican John the Baptist, Dr. Sylvester 
Graham. I'll wager not a third of you 
know it was for him that Graham flour 
was named. But between the Pure 
Pood agitation and faddists of one order 
and another. Uncooked Foodites, vege- 
tarians, and so on, there is more thought 
spent on the matter than ever before. 
Best of all, the women in their clubs 
are trying to settle not only the mean- 
ing and bearing of this Pure Food 
question but of food in general for all 
ages. So I am inclined to think we 
shall presently be the most rationally 
fed nation on the planet, eating far less 
than we have thought necessary, and 
taking more time to it." 



"Fletcherizing!" said one of the 
group about him. * 'Oh, come, doctor! 
I've known you too long to believe 
you'll cut us off from your 'little din- 
ners, ' as you will call them, and the 
sense of peaceful satisfaction left with 
their eaters. Don't do it. It would 
be a crime." 

**It may be, my friend. We shall 
presently have to believe the crime is 
in letting them tempt us beyond rational 
bounds," was the reply. * *But that is 
neither here nor there just now. What 
is certain is that for thinking people 
there is a growing willingness not only 
to question, but to experiment. The 
famous Chittenden Report of the Yale 
University experiment helped the move- 
ment, for even the doctors handle it 
with respect. And now here's the dig- 
nified World's Work with a long ar- 
ticle on 'The Spread of Fletcherism.'" 

"Let that go!" said an impatient 
voice. *'It's true enough, but too 
upsetting to old notions. The Pure

Food people are all right. It's a good 
fight, and yet there's a strong word to 
say for some adulterations. Here's 
Stillman himself, the crack chemist at 
Stevens Institute, who gave a chem- 
ical dinner the other day, you know. 
I mean a dinner at which most of the 
dishes were chemical combinations, 
their nature not given. He declares 
that a good deal of the food adultera- 
tion is not harmful, but, on the whole, 
a benefit to the poor. The reporters 
were after him of course, and here's 
what he said, " — and the speaker took 
a slip from his note-book. ' *I sent my 
boy to the store to buy a pound of the 
cheapest raspberry jelly. The boy 
brought back something which looked 
and tasted Uke raspberry jelly, but 
which never saw a berry. It cost 
twelve cents. The cheapest possible 
cost for raspberry jelly, it has been 
computed, would be thirty cents a 
pound, — the real raspberry jelly, I 
mean. That represents the bed-rock 
cost aside from the labor cost and the 
profits. Now I analyzed that rasp- 
berry jelly, and found that it was made 
of apple pulp after the dder was 
squeezed out, glucose, and a few other 
materials. It is true that it would not 
appeal to the educated palate, but it 
brings the luxury of raspberry jelly 
within the reach of the very poor. It 
was entirely harmless. It was nourish- 
ing. The only harm was the fact that 
it was labeled as an imitation. I could 
give you many other instances of a 
similar kind, but to no different pur- 
pose. Label it properly, and they might 
not buy it, but sweet is a legitimate 
food, and this was good to spread on 
the children's bread. What shall we 
do about it?" 

''Legislation will settle all that," 
said another of the group. **I was 
at that dinner, a most extraordinary 
one, though it tasted all right, plus the 
awful uncertainty in which it left you 
as to what he might be foisting on you. 
The ice-cream was delicious. Sherry 



couldn't beat it, — no, nor that old place 
in Philadelphia that makes the best in 
the world, they say, — Blanck's, you 
know. But this is what Stillman 
evolved. He took some triple refined 
cotton-seed oil, and placed it in a cen- 
trifugal machine, revolving three thou- 
sand times a minute. Something had 
to happen, and it did. Out came a 
beautiful emulsion, which needed only 
to be sweetened and flavored and frozen. 
The sweet was saccharin, and the 
flavor vanillin, glucin, and nitro-benzol. 
Smooth as velvet, and no mortal could 
have told it wasn't pure cream. That 
is a sample of all the other mysteries. 
He said that he had been told ice-cream 
like his compound is made and sold in 
a good many of the Southern States, 
where cotton-seed oil is more abundant, 
and so cheaper than milk or cream. It 
can do no harm, being a perfectly 
healthful combination. It tastes good, 
afid melts much less quickly than the 
real thing. In short, it's a champion 
fraud, like your raspberry-jelly busi- 
ness; but it answers the purpose, so 
what shall we do about it?" 

' 'Thank the powers that the average 
housekeeper doesn't own a centrifugat- 
ing machine and isn't likely to at 
present," said a serious old gentleman, 
who had shaken his head mournfully 
as he listened. "The fact is, between 
the Simple Life people, who send you 
back to barbarism and before, with their 
diet of nuts and fruits, and this new 
terror of one tablet equivalent to a meal 
sounding from the chemical labora- 
tories, we are going to pieces as a peo- 
ple." 

"Never despair!" the first speaker 
said, with a laugh so cheery that the 
old gentleman smiled an uncertain, un- 
accustomed smile. ' 'So long as Dr. 
Hutchinson is in all the public prints 
with his shout for more pork and all 
the things our grandmothers used to 
make, doughnuts and pie included, we 
shall not abolish the kitchens. The 
point is that, if the chemical things are

proved to be really wholesome as well 
as palatable, we are safe against a 
famine. H. G. Wells should have been 
at that dinner, and got a kink or two 
for his new edition of 'Coming Uto- 
pias.'" 

* 'We don't want 'em," said the old 
gentleman, decisively. **I am pretty 
certain the Lord's methods are better 
than the chemist's, and what I eat 
shall have the good brown earth for its 
start, and sun and rain and dew to 



do the rest. Btu-bank has sense. I'll 
stand by him, no matter what tricks 
he plays with sensible vegetables, but 
this chemical nonsense I won't stand." 
And now, as the group laughed, he 
stumped from the room, his cane ac- 
centing the low gnunble of protest still 
on his lips, and went his way to the old- 
fashioned house in which his days went 
by, and from which new theories and new 
methods, no less, were carefully barred 
out. 



A House-warming 

By Mary Barrows 



ONE of the principles underlying 
the revival of the arts and 
crafts is the recognition of the 
human quality of the work, — ^the value 
of its individuality opposed to the 
monotony of the machine-made prod- 
uct, and the consequent joy of the 
workman in toil that has its reward 
in understanding and appreciation, 
and not merely in dollars and cents. 

It is strange that we take so much 
interest in what we put into our houses 
and expend so little thought upon the 
buildings themselves. Many, of course, 
are not able to build their own homes, 
and must make the best of the house 
that is made to rent. But all the 
symposiums in the household maga- 
zines, on building a house with the 
savings from an average working- 
man's income, show that this privilege 
does not - belong to the money kings 
only. 

Does the human quality of work in 
the trades demand less sympathy than 
that in the crafts? Why does the 
owner's thought of his house go to the 
person of the architect and the con- 
tractor, and stop there? The popular 
idea seems to be that a house takes form 
in spite of a horde of warring clans that 



do their worst upon it. The masons 
descend and make a legalized hole that 
will answer to put a building over (at 
least it holds water!), the carpenters 
come, and the plasterers and the steam- 
fitters and the plumbers and the pa- 
perers, each trade fearful that it shall 
do something beyond the bounds of 
its domain. It is not wonderful that 
the parts of a house so built should 
hardly hold together. 

To lay the blame for this on the labor 
unions is a comfortable dismissal of the 
subject. But what is responsible for 
the labor unions, with all their faults? 
Not to enter too deeply into the realms 
of economics and sociology, is it not 
the elimination of the human element 
from the work of the trades that has 
driven them to organization in self- 
defence? As the individual worker 
has not been recognized by the indi- 
vidual for whom the work is done, the 
latter is hoist with his own petard, 
and no consideration is shown for his 
individual taste or demands. 

It is interesting to recall cases in 
which the existence of a personal rela- 
tion between the owner Sid the work- 
man has prevented a * 'scamped job," 
in spite of a contractor who was not 




72 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



above suspicion. One in point was 
that of a young steam-fitter who saw 
to it that his part of the contract was 
carried out according to specifications, 
because he knew the woman for whom 
the house was being built, although 
the architect through slackness or 
graft was neglecting to hold the con- 
tractor to the letter of his contract. 

There are indications that better 
times may come, if we want them. 
The happiest instance in the knowledge 
of the writer is a house-warming that 
took place in one of our American 
cities not long ago. 

It seemed to the gentleman and his 
wife for whom this house had been 
built that, next to themselves, the 
persons most interested in the finished 
and ftunished house were the men who 
had made it. So for the house-warming 
these men and theif wives were the 
chosen guests. Mrs. N. said, * 'Of 
course we knew most of the men by face 
and speech through frequent visits 
to the house while it was building." 
(Can many women say **0f course"?) 
But from the contractors the names and 
addresses were obtained and invita- 
tions were sent out to all, from the 
architect and builder down to the boy 
who carried the water and the old 
man who leveled off the lawn and the 
man who laid the cement walks. 

Friends of the hosts said that the 
invited guests would not come, that 
they would feel patronized, etc., etc. 
But the lady of the house, a noble 
name that has been lightly used — 
said, * *If we do not feel patronizing, I 
don't think there is much danger that 
they will feel patronized." 

They came. About sixty men had 
been employed. These and their wives 
and a few personal friends of the hosts 
brought the number up to a hundred. 
They went all over the house from 
cellar to attic, taking great pride in 
pointing out to their wives their own 
work. ' 'I laid all that mantel face." 



* *I done that." The paperers explained 
with pride how the paper had been 
centred in the big living-room to bring 
the design just right above the fire- 
place. The wood finishers passed their 
hands lovingly over the rubbed doors 
in the library. An old Irishman said 
he * *pit his spade in for the first shovel- 
ful of earth that iver come out of the 
cellar." 

One is inclined to conjecture whether 
these men had ever been given an op- 
portimity to show their wives the kind 
and quality of their daily work, and 
whether it would result in widening 
the range of conversation in the fam- 
ilies. The women, however, were 
naturally most concerned with the 
pictures, curtains, and other furnish- 
ings. 

After the whole house had been in- 
spected, all were seated in the living- 
room. There was singing, a brief 
prayer of dedication, then the little 
daughter lit the fire on the hearth the 
first time, and all sang * *Home, Sweet 
Home." A few short speeches fol- 
lowed, and the more formal exercises 
closed with an expression of gratitude 
from the * host to the men who had 
helped to make the home. 

Then came a Virginia reel, one of 
the family friends, a clergyman, lead- 
ing with the wife of one of the carpen- 
ters; and after the frolic came the 
supper. It was a genuinely good time 
from beginning to end. 

Among the by-products of the even- 
ing has been the naming of a baby 
girl for the hostess and of a fine boy 
for the host ! And, better than this, a 
friendly turning to Mr. N. on the part 
of the men for advice and help. 

The moral of the house-warming 
has many ramifications, but, since it 
was not given to point a moral, far be 
it from the writer to exceed in zeal the 
wise man and woman whose plan it 
was. At least, it affords much food for 
thought. 



A Day in Autumn 

By Eugene C. Dolson 



Bright red-winged blackbirds wheel above 

The reedy pasture land, 
Where, yoked and moveless, in the brook 

Knee-deep the oxen stand. 

Far off you see gray smoke wreaths curl 

Prom chimneys of the mill. 
And noon-time hour comes heralded 

By bell and whistle shrill. 



A waft of air floats up the way, 

The leaves are softly stirred ; 
And deep in woodland shades ring out 

The clear nates of a bird. 

Dear Nature's changing light and gloom- 

Her smiles and solitudes — 
Flit over all the quiet land. 

While dreamful Autumn broods.

Three Hundred Miles of Blackberry Pie 

and Fried Chicken 

A Neutf al, Non-committal Story of a National Episode 

By Felix J. Koch 



NOT so many years ago but 
that those participating in the 
feast still recall it vividly, a 
ride was made by a guerrilla band — 
Morgan's men, to be exact — into the 
border country of North and South, 
which remains unparalleled in history 
for being, as the leader of the pursuers 
claimed, a "ride of blackberry pie 
and fried chicken." 

The story would serve well as a plot 
for a military pastoral. For six full 
months prior to receipt of orders to 
go in pursuit, the home troops had 
had little rest. Now that the recess 
hour had come, they pitched camp 
in a peaceful, rural region, where the 
troops might recuperate at their leisure, 
and incidentally court the pretty 
farmer girls, from among whom many 
a soldier lad, later, chose his wife. 

Then came the eventful day. A 
courier brought the news, — ^the foe was 
close at hand, and the soldiers must be 
off in pursuit within an hour of the 
warning. Two days* rations were to 
be taken, — ^beyond these they must live 



from the country. It was the sort of 
expedition youth delights in most, and 
youth made up the greater part of 
that company. 

How many weary.miles they followed 
the enemy, the heavy dust thrown on 
the herbage by two thousand odd 
steeds plainly marking the way; how 
attempts were made to throw them 
from the trail by cannon fired from 
towns miles to either side; and how the 
farmers, enraged at the theft of their 
horses, valiantly came to the rescue 
by plainly stating the whereabouts 
of the raiders, — is immaterial to the 
story. Suffice it to say that on the 
fourth and then on the fifth of the 
month there were encounters between 
the two legions, and that the one 
started off in wild flight, the other in 
equally hot pursuit. 

Thus opened the ride of pie and 
chickens. 

Early on his mission of pursuit the 
leader, one Colonel Allen, had expressed 
a fondness for these two dainties, del- 
icacies the country-side then afforded 



74 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



in profusion, and this information had 
reached the farmers. Good-hearted, 
kindly folk, as agrarians ever are, they 
resolved to give their champions the 
best they might, and so, over the route 
taken by the pursued, ovens and 
ranges were burdened with chickens 
and pie, in readiness for the pursuer. 

Mile on mile, without end, as the 
troops rode by, bashful little country 
girls took their places at the way- 
side, their heads bowed low, showing 
tousled curls, their arms aloft, bearing 
broad platters, spread with clean 
white napkins, on which rested two, 
three, four luscious blackberry pies, 
from which the ruby juice oozed as the 
sun beat down, trickling out on the 
napkins. Little brothers — barefoot 
and hatless, clad only in jean pants 
and a suspender — ^kept their sisters 
company, with a fried chicken held 
in either hand, ready to be reached to 
the soldiers. At the bend of the road 
father and tmde stood guard over 
trays of fowl, while mothers awaited 
their chance to assist at the serving. 

Nor did the troopers stop to feast. 
It was a mad, wild chase that lay before, 
— 0. chase that would end in victory or 
defeat, according only as the horses 
would last. The enemy, with com- 
mendable shrewdness, had cleared the 
country of steeds of every description, 
so that fresh mounts for the pursuer 
were unobtainable. 

Day in, day out, they must ride and 
ride,— eating as they went. 

Then there began another phase of 
this ride through the land of fowl and 
berry. Music, for accompaniment, was 
also to be provided, and that in a patri- 
otic monotone. One song, and one 
only, had been selected to do them 
honor, and as they rode past lonely 
farms or through hamlets, or passed a 
toll-gate or an inn, every one from the 
township gathered, and sang until they 
disappeared over the horizon. In the 
night-time tired troopers, sleeping, — 
hats tied to their heads to prevent fall- 



ing when nodding, — would suddenly 
awake, as they dashed through a town, 
to be surrounded by a chorus of villagers. 
Sentries in the van, half asleep, would be 
roused to their labors by some family 
group, at an isolated cross-road, like- 
wise singing the paean. At last, as the 
leader of the expedition says, it seemed 
as if the very katydids had taken up the 
refrain, and buzzed it into their ears. 

When they were not eating chicken 
and pie or listening to the music of 
the country-side, and there was a 
chance, the soldiers begged for other 
fare, — ^anything, the very plainest, — 
but it could not be secured. The 
more they begged, the more pie and 
fowl were forthcoming, for the farmers 
mistook their queries as a desire for 
food, and only the best could be given 
the soldiers. And that best was, of 
course, the inevitable! 

Finally, as all things must have an 
end, the guerrillas were overtaken, and 
forced to surrender. The site of the 
capitulation was a pleasant valley, 
watered by a river. Two thousand 
odd troopers on the one side, — none of 
whom had had his clothes off in three 
weeks, — possibly as many on the 
other, pitched their camps beside the 
stream. Then one-half from either 
side plunged into the deep waters, and 
washed away the dust and grime, and, 
in a very distinctly marked half of the 
company, the traces of blackberry pie, 
which had stained their mouths and 
chins. 

After that an old-fashioned dinner 
al fresco was served from the wallets 
and haversacks of either side, and the 
legends of the country go to say that 
many a toothsome fowl and juicy pie, 
baked for the pursuer, now found its 
way into the hands of the enemy. 

So ended the ride of blackberry 
pie and chicken. A little over three 
decades afterward, when the survivors 
of the ride, who had not been num- 
bered among the silent majority, met, 
the defeated of that day the guests

of the victors, recollections of the was that the leader told the tale of 
ride through pie and. chicken land were what he called ' 'Three Hundred Miles 
passed from lip to lip. And then it of Fried Chicken." 



Hospitality made Easy 

By Alice Hussey Gauss 



THE memory of a comfortable 
hearth at the tired end of the 
afternoon, with lounging chairs 
and pleasant lights, where one has 
warmed his heart as well as his feet, 
and where he has been tempted to 
think and talk of the more real things 
of life, is a possession of almost any one 
of us; and I suppose there are few good 
wives and mothers who do not wish 
such happy memories to be carried 
from their homes. Indfeed, hospitality 
is the pride of the young wife; and it 
is only when she is confronted by poor 
help, scant finances, and, perhaps, the 
added care of little babies that she feels 
herself gradually losing her grasp on 
her first ideals, and the * 'dropping in" 
of friends becomes sometimes a pleas- 
ure with a burden. I have myself been 
through the mill, and I have protested 
at every step against the difficulties of 
hospitality, holding firmly to my belief 
that friends were worth far more than 
the conventionalities that made their 
pleasant breaking of bread with us a 
burden. And out of this persistent 
protest has finally come the solution of, 
at least, my own difiiculties. Perhaps 
a few of my devices may prove sugges- 
tive to others. 

One of the first cares of the hostess 
will naturally be the living-room; and 
for one I would say, * *Do not take too 
much care of it!" The chairs and 
tables have a way of arranging them- 
selves sociably in a room that is much 
used, and the housewife will do well to 
take suggestions, at least, from this 



natural arrangement, if she wishes her 
room to be homelike. As for the daily 
dusting, I have found that a few mo- 
ments of attention before breakfast 
did more for the comfort of oiu* house- 
hold and our friends than an hour later 
in the day. It was but a few mo- 
ments' work to lay the fire, freshen the 
rugs with a damp broom, give a few 
touches to the table, — where, by the 
way, only books which we really were 
reading were allowed to remain, — fill 
the lamp, and renew the candles. By 
breakfast time the room itself was a 
sort of invitation, and the nervous fear 
lest some one should come in upon a 
cold hearth and an untidy room was 
over for the day. I speak of this es- 
pecially, because I have tested so thor- 
oughly the value of planning work to 
relieve the nervous strain. My chief 
watchword would be * Tlan." Keep 
at least a day ahead. Whatever is 
going to worry one if it is not done on 
time should be done first. We shall 
catch up with the rest, and keep happy 
withal. 

I spoke a moment ago of candles. 
They may seem an extravagance to 
some, but we found them not to be so, 
even preferring a cheap grade to giving 
them up, so restful is their light. There 
is a time between daylight and dark 
when candle-light seems best to fit the 
mood, the time of the afternoon tea. 
The tea table, by the way, we found to 
be an excellent substitute for a fire- 
place when the latter was an impossi- 
bility. A brass tray with shining cups

and reflected candle-light is almost as 
cheering as the wood flame, and often 
quite as conducive to pleasant exchange 
of thought. At first, preparing for the 
afternoon tea seemed somewhat of a 
burden, as I always waited until the 
time was at hand before getting the 
things ready. But, finally, as a dear 
grandmother said, "I got it into a 
habit." Each day after dinner I set 
the tray, without a doily,— everything 
ready but scalding the tea and filling 
the hot-water pitcher. And so it was 
ready at the boiling of the water, when 
we were all comfortably gathered at 
dusk, and seemed no work at all. On 
Saturdays, too, I had my tea tray in 
mind, and usually added to my baking 
a batch of cookies, though Graham 
wafers are acceptable and much simpler. 

But it was in the matter of meals 
that I was obliged to reduce everything 
to the simplest, and to be most fore- 
handed, not only to be always ready, 
but also to avoid the expense of a 
hurried meal. At the outset I saw 
that the question of fresh table linen 
was a serious one. There is no part 
of the household that so swells the 
laundry account; and I decided that 
linen, all but napkins, must go. I may 
yet abandon even these for paper ones! 
At the small expense of fifteen cents 
per roll I furnished myself with the 
pretty, decorative, crApe paper to be had 
now in all colors and designs. Out of 
one roll there was sufiScient for a strip 
down the centre of the table, six doilies, 
and two candle shades. The idea 
proved most satisfactory, and was in- 
variably appreciated by my guests. 
This use of the doilies instead of a table- 
cloth was quite possible in our own 
case, as we decided to have supper at 
night for the two reasons that it made 
the work in the kitchen much simpler 
and that, as a majority of our guests 
came in the evening, we could enter- 
tain them at the less pretentious meal. 

The next and more important ques- 
tion was that of food; and here I 



soon found what supplies were most 
needed for quick and inexpensive dishes. 
They are simple and ordinary, I admit, 
but it took me some time to learn their 
value, and it may save some one an 
unnecessary expense of spirit, if I give 
a few of my menus for this season and 
a list of the supplies I have found to 
be most helpful. I would say, in pass- 
ing, that the thought and time taken 
to keep a batch of menus on hand and 
to keep my stores filled have been amply 
repaid in the ease of serving quick 
meals and in the saving of grocery bills. 
In so planning, one always finds for odds 
and ends uses which might not suggest 
themselves on the spur of the moment.

wafers (see this magazine, January, 
1906), or any kind of small cakes. A 
few minutes spent on a rainy or quiet 
evening in cracking a few nuts or sort- 
ing a few raisins help very materially 
towards making the baking easy. 

But, again and last, I would say that 
nothing contributes so much to general 
peace of mind — and the cheerful 
hostess must be free of the fetters of 
nervousness — as this planning &head. 
Two hours once a week will do it all. 
And the sense of security, even the 
sense of thrift which it brings, gives to 
the leisure hours of companionship 
with friends and books a freedom with- 
out which there can be no real think- 
ing, no real living. 



Who owns the Farm? 

By Kate M. Post 



We bought the house and the apple-trees, 
And the spring where the cresses grew, 

The old stone wall and the slope of grass 
All studded with violets blue. 

We bought and paid for them honestly, 

In the usual business way: 
Twas settled, we thought, yet there are some 

Who dispute our title each day. 

A phoebe came to the eastern porch. 
Where I loitered one sunny day. 

And told me that porch was hers, not mine. 
Just as plainly as bird could say. 

That she didn't want me prying there 

Into all her family affairs, 
And asked me by pert little gestures, 

If I had no family cares. 

The vireo perched high above me, 
In the great branching apple-tree, 

And said, "I am here, I'm here, I'm here," 
As though 'twere important to me. 



And then he most saucily asked me, 
"Who are you?" in such an odd way 

That I felt quite like an intruder, 
And I hadn't a word to say. 

A pair of robins have made their home 

In that very same apple-tree. 
And they plainly tell me every day 

That they don't care a straw for me. 

And a pair of chippies think the limbs 

Are exactly the proper height ; 
They've been looking round some time, I know. 

For a suitable building site. 

What right have we in this place, think you, 
When the crows make free with our com, 

And the brown thrush says "good-bye" each 
night, 
And the blue jay calls us at mom ? 

The chimney belongs to the swallows, 
The piazza's owned by the wren. 

We'll take care to see our title's clear. 
When we purchase a farm again. 



Simmons College 



First Commencement of the Technical College for Women who Work 

(Press Report) 



ON June 13 Simmons College 
held its first Commencement 
exercises, when thirty-two 
young women received diplomas, having 
completed the four years' coiu-se, and 
twenty-four certificates were given to 
college graduates and others who had 
taken the one-year course. 

President Lefavour opened his ad- 
dress with a brief summary of the life 
of John Simmons, the founder of the 
college, who came to Boston a hundred 
years ago. He said the question of 
intensification of preparation for a live- 
lihood both for men and for women 
had now become acute, and one impor- 
tant step in answer to the challenge 
was a provision in the will of John Sim- 
mons, as a result of which this group of 
students go forth indebted to the gen- 
erosity and wisdom and prescience of 
that Rhode Island boy. 

It is not easy to put into words what 
is meant by civilization, and that we 
cannot as a people be said to have at 
heart a higher standard than that which 
enters into our daily life, measured by 
the general average of our conduct and 
the every-day application of our laws. 
If there is a corrupt municipal govern- 
ment, we have to inquire whether it is 
with the intelligent consent of those 
governed or through their ignorance 
of the far-reaching consequence of 
their votes. If the latter, the result 
is only momentary: if the former, it is 
a measure of the degree of civilization. 
The standard measure of our achieve- 
ment is the common usage of the many. 
We have not the intensity of religious 
faith of the Egyptian nor the perfec- 
tion of art of the Greeks nor the ma- 
jestic beauty of law of the Romans. 
Yet all of the common people of these 
nations had not the freedom which is 
enjoyed by the humblest citizen among 



us to-day. In civilization there is a 
progressive development, not uniform, 
perhaps losing ground in one direction 
as it gains in another, but always with 
a quantitative accumulative freedom 
for the individual to act in accordance 
with one's nattu'al desires, freedom to 
work, to know, to believe, and to make 
use of the talents with which an indi- 
vidual is endowed, be they few or 
many. 

This social evolution is not recent or 
modem, and with each change there 
comes a deeper obligation to insure to 
others a freedom of self-development. 
The hundred years that have elapsed 
since John Simmons came to Boston 
are sufficient to have marked the 
changes. The general average civiliza- 
tion is far higher than then, if the mass 
of people is considered, and not the 
privileged few. 

A few individuals, perhaps, even may 
be at a disadvantage because of these 
changes, but the key to it all lies in the 
possibilities for independence of thought 
and action that obtain for the htunblest 
citizen. I believe that the strongest 
motives that have actuated great 
human crises have been a consciousness 
of the sufferings and wrongs of those 
about us. It is the class wrong that 
has produced rebellion, and the new 
century seems likely to be a period of 
awakening social recognition, that not 
only gives alms and relieves distress, 
seeks to recognize and to remove the 
obstacles that stand in the way of free 
personal development, to deal chari- 
tably and justly, to measure motives 
and to gauge responsibility. 

Education has two large, separate, 
and yet largely interdependent tasks. 
It prepares our youth for life with a 
sharpening of all their faculties and a 
knowledge of the world in which they 



The Path by the Brook 



79 



are to live and of their relations to it. 
It fits our youth also for a life of use- 
fulness, and to give such as need it the 
necessary knowledge of some profession 

or art or craft that shall enable them 

« 

to maintain themselves and to serve 
the world. 

When John Simmons made his will, 
there existed the various parts of a 
complete system for attaining the first 
of these two objects, but the second 
had not been developed so systemati- 
cally, and we are far to-day from hav- 
ing a true polytechnic. It is only with- 
in a few years that the State has 
begun to inquire into the need of tech- 
nical and industrial instruction for the 
trades and crafts. 

In carrying out this practical educa- 
tion, three methods may be used. We 
may complete the general education, 
and then begin the application to some 
definite practical end, or we may begin 
the practical instruction before the 
completion of the general courses, carry- 
ing them both side by side, gradually 
increasing the amount of practical in- 
struction tmtil we reach the climax, — 
the method adopted in Simmons Col- 
lege. It is more and more recognized 
in our training for professional and en- 
gineering vocations, having for its ad- 
vantage that the whole education be- 
comes more intensive, the correlation 
of subjects more apparent, and the in- 
terest of the students more assured. 

The third method, least practicable 
of all, has most to be said for it, — a con- 
current combination of actual work and 
study. In our future social develop- 
ment, then, the signs are not wanting 



that we must prepare for a more inten- 
sive education. 

It will be the duty of each commu- 
nity to offer opportunities to its mem- 
bers for a life of usefulness. Onr 
methods must be improved, that time 
shall not be wasted. I do not need to 
enlarge on the part that women must 
play in this scheme of education. The 
work of most must be in the home, but 
many will be called on to contribute to 
other activities, and our general edu- 
cational plan. must provide equally for 
this. The institution we represent must 
stand for the dignity of labor and for 
the idea of usefulness through educa- 
tion. 

In closing, President Lefavour bade 
the pupils have the word ' ^service*' ever 
on their lips, and to remember that all 
must bear one another's burdens, and, 
so fulfilling the law of Christ, forget 
their own. After music. Miss Sarah 
Louise Arnold, dean of the college, pre-

The Path by the Brook 

By Cora A. Matson Dolson 



Along the slanting brookside grow 
Green hemlocks in a winding row. 
A brown path wanders in and out 
The fragrant hemlock tnmks about. 



Whenever down that path I stray. 
Crowds, fret, and toil move far away. 
While Nature's ever-healing calm 
Seems for all human ills a balm.

THE A. M. A. 

• 

IN June the American Medical As- 
sociation held its annu^ con- 
vention in this dty. The doctors 
came, five thousand strong, held sue- 
cessftd meetings in many sections, and 
-left behind them the impression of 
being an intelligent, earnest, and pro- 
gressive class of men. They placed 
themselves squarely on record as ad- 
vocates of pure chemicals, pure food, 
wholesome diet, and the practice of 
temperance and moderation in all things. 
The latest ways in medicine and surgery 
were exhibited and discussed by them, 
evidently with great interest and profit 
to all concerned. 

Thanks to the scientific methods of 
the doctors, in no line of investigation, 
perhaps, has greater progress been made 
than in that of the healing art. More 
of nattu'e and less of drugs is the keynote 
in all discussions of hygienic living 
to-day. To prescribe improved diet- 
aries, to teach more scientific and sani- 
tary ways of life, is the highest preroga- 
tive of the modem physician. And the 
doctors are trying to keep up with the 
times. What friend more welcome 
ever than a faithful doctor? 

Was it not our own Doctor Franklin, 
though not an M.D., who said long ago, 
"Early to bed and early to rise make 
a man healthy, wealthy, and wise*'? 
Here, again, is another and somewhat 
humorous prescription for wise and 
wholesome living. It is an expression, 
^Iso, of the latest phase of thought on 
this all-important subject: — 

"If you do not want the doctor to 
take your life, keep away from him. 
Dig daily in the dirt ; get on good terms 
with trees and flowers, birds and grass, 
— ^they are your brothers, all; mix more 



Editorials

with animals and less with men; love 
horses and cows and care for them; be 
extravagant only in the use of fresh air; 
eat anything you Uke, but in modera- 
tion; think well of everybody, — even 
doctors, lawyers, and preachers, — ^for 
they are all acting according to their 
highest light. Keep busy: activity is 
life. The genuine jo)rs of life are to be 
gotten from useful effort, and to hunt 
for pleasure is to lose it. Do your work, 
and pleasure will come to you. Health 
is your due, and will flow to you natu- 
rally if you do not get too anxious 
about it. God is on our side." 



HOME-MAKING 

BEFORE the days of great cities 
the people of this land lived 
more largely in their own 
homes. Family Ufe was more signifi- 
cant. In the towns and villages all 
over New England how many old-time 
mansions and farm-houses are pointed 
out where large and noted families once 
lived! Then the family- name was 
cherished and kept unspotted from the 
world. In many cases these places are 
now occupied, if they be frequented at 
all, by strangers and sojourners whose 
chief interests are elsewhere. 

The desirability of building and own- 
ing; one's own home is almost beyond 
comprehension. The home is an ex- 
pression of the hfe and character of 
the builder. It reveals his tastes and 
his ideals. Each of us builds into his 
home what he stands for in life. 

We are glad that a marked tendency 
of the day is a migration from city to 
open country rather than from country 
citywards. The ambition of many 
working people to possess a home of 
their own is indicative, at no distant 
day, of better ways of liviag. City life 
is unnatural and unwholesome. Chil- 
dren especially, like plants, need grow 
up out of doors and in contact with 
earth. Outdoor Ufe, contact with 
nature, are essential to vigor and 



strength, both physical and mental. 
The dty-bred child is limited in his 
activities. The country lad becomes 
adept in many kinds of handicraft. 
His acquaintance with field and wood, 
with bird and animal Ufe, is first hand. 
He learns to face the natural conditions 
of Ufe, and in nine cases out of ten to 
win out. 

In the June Century a writer, in a 
striking article on the negro and the 
South, says: **I confidently venture 
the statement that no man can expand 
to his full possibilities in a rented house. 
The Christian virtue's blossom in their 
perfection about one's own fireside. 
Every lesson of moraUty, every elevated 
thought, doubles there its power and 
influence, and this is true of the 
nomad's tent, the negro's cottage, and 
of the homes of the rich and strong. 
Here is the beginning of aU good govern- 
ment. The family is the type of the 
State. The men who have learned to 
command their own full powers and 
restrain themselves constitute, when 
united, a conununity; and the union of 
communities is the State. As a nation, 
we may bathe our brows in the clouds, 
but we should always warm our feet 
by the fireside of homes." 

In same Une of thought the editor of 
a reUgious w^kly writes: — 

*The resurrection of the home is the 
hope of modem times, and there is 
nothing more deUghtf ul than the present 
social tendency toward more home- 
making. The struggle to escape the 
crowd and get a chance to build a home 
is a marked feature of the times. In 
the dty to create a home is, for the very 
large majority, an impossibiUty. A 
few can command the situation, but 
the rest must get into the shell of some- 
body else, at so much per month. They 
Uve and they work without ever having 
built their thoughts even into a house, 
much less into a garden, an orchard, 
and a home. Every himian being 
should think out, feel out, grow out, a 
house and a home. 



82 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



' *Too little is made of this home-grow- 
ing. The key of heaven is the key to 
one's own house. 

''To build right sort of homes should 
be the first lesson of the education that 
takes hold upon our children. The 
end of school work is not erudition, but 
the natural use of our emotions and the 
right development of our tastes. We 
have got wholesomely by the idea that 
religion is to fit us for golden streets. 
Therefore, religion may now go legiti- 
mately farther, and the pulpit may find 
no better topic than a worldly paradise, 
a beautiful home, where good purposing 
goes with beautiful doing and truthful 
conceiving. We drop the obUgation 
to believe correctly as having no more 
religion in it than saying the multiplica- 
tion table, both essential, but neither of 
them substantial piety. Home is the 
real heaven and the end of right re- 
ligion." 

THE LESSON OF THE HOUR 

WHAT with railroad rebates, 
insurance abuses, food adul- 
terations, meat inspection, 
medical abominations, and the long 
days, the people of this land are passing 
through a very interesting course of 
instruction. Out of it all may much 
good come! Justice and right are of 
far greater consequence than riches and 
power. What people everywhere are 
longing for and ever striving to attain 
to is fair and honest dealing, man with 
man. If this condition does not now 
prevail, if all people do not have fair 
and equal opportunities to gain a 
livelihood, why not, and what is the 
remedy thereof? Politics are not ex- 
actly in our line, though matters per- 
taining to economy are of universal 
concern. It will not be amiss to remind 
our readers of the fact that the exist- 
ing state of affairs, the occasion of so

grown up entirely under our present

for people to look thoroughly into the 
economic policy of the nation, and see 
if aught of mischief or wrong be con-

In Common Things 

Seek not afar for beauty. Lol it glows 
In dew- wet grasses aU about thy feet; 
In birds, in sunshine, childish faces sweet, 

In stars, and mountain summits topped with 
snows. 

Go not abroad for happiness. For, see, 
It is a flower that blossoms by thy door I 
Bring love and justice home, and then no 
more 

Thou'lt wonder in what dwelling joy may be. 

Dream not of noble service elsewhere wrought : 
The simple duty that awaits thy hand 
Is God's voice uttering a divine command; 

Life's common deeds build all that saints 
have thought. 

In wonder-workings, or some bush aflame, 
Men look for God, and fancy him concfaledi 
But in earth's common things he stands 
revealed. 
While grass and flowers and stars spell out 
his name.

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 

IN mil recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after sitting once. 
When 6our is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. 
A tablespoonful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a level spoonful of such material. 



Cream of Lettuce and Green Pea 

Soup 
Select two large heads of lettuce. 
Remove and wash through several 
waters the outer leaves, leaving the 
hearts for salad. Drain the leaves 
carefully on a cloth. Melt two or three 
tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan. 
In it cook the lettuce leaves ten minutes, 
stirring occasionally, then add a quart 
of boiling water, a leek, or a peeled onion 
with three or four cloves pushed into 
it, a stalk of celery, if at hand, a table- 
spoonful of sugar, a teaspoonful of 
salt, and two sprigs of parsley. Cover 
the pan, and let cook half an hour, 
then add a pint of shelled peas, and let 
cook another half-hour, adding more 
water if needed. Press the whole 
through a sieve (first removing the 



onion and parsley). Add one quart 
of broth, and let simmer. Mix one- 
fourth a cup of flour with half a cup 
of milk to a smooth paste, and stir into 
the soup. Stir until boiling, then let 
simmer ten minutes. Finish with half 
or a whole cup of cream. 

Soft-Shell Crabs, Newburgh 
Carefully dress half a dozen soft- 
shell crabs {see magazine for June-July, 
1905). Wash the crabs in very cold 
water, and dry them on a soft cloth, 
then sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Melt three or four tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a frying-pan. Put in the 
crabs, side by side, and let cook with 
strong heat, but without burning, 
three minutes, then turn, and cook the 
other side three minutes. If preferred.

broil the crabs over the coals. Re- 
move to a hot plate. Add more butter, 
if there be not two tablespoonfuls left 



Dispose on a serving-dish. Set above 
each two pieces of tomato, an egg 
carefully poached in salted water, and 
dispose a slice of broiled 
bacon above and below the 
eggs. If preferred, the toma- 
toes may be cooked in the

Breakfast Dish 



in the pan, stir in two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, then, when frothy, add half a 
cup, each, of milk and thin cream. 
Stir until boiling. Let simmer three 
minutes, then add the crabs. Set the 
dish over hot water, and, when the 
crabs are thoroughly heated, stir in the 
yolks of two eggs, beaten and diluted 
with one-fourth a cup of sherry wine. 
Do not break the crabs when stirring in 
the eggs. 

A Late-summer Breakfast Dish 
Peel three tomatoes, and cut out 



Green Corn, Creole Style 

Cut the com from six ears 

of young, tender com, leaving 

as much of the hull on the 

ears as possible. Add half of 

a green pepper, chopped fine, 

a little grated onion, and three 

peeled tomatoes, cut up fine. Heat the 

whole to the boiling-point, then let 

simmer about fifteen minutes or until 

reduced somewhat. Add meanwhile 

half a teaspoonful, each, of salt and 

sugar, and, just before removing from 

the fire, two teaspoonfuls of butter. 

Creamed Green Corn 
Peel back the husks, and remove the 
silk from about eight ears of tender 
sweet com. Replace the husks, and 
set the com to cook in boiling salted 
water. After twenty minutes remove

Chicken Bechamel in 
Potato Patty Cases 
Cot cooked chicken 
into small cubes, and 
season lightly with 
salt, paprika, and 
celery salt. For a cup 
and a third of chicken 
melt two tablespoon fuls of butter, and 
cook in it two tablespoonfuls of flour 
and one -fourth a teaspoonful, each, 
of salt and paprika. When frothy, 
stir in half a cup, each, of cream 
and chicken broth. Stir until boiling, 
then add the chicken, and let stand 
over hot water until ready to serve. 
Have about three cups of mashed 
potato, seasoned with cream or milk 
and butter, salt, and a little pepper. 
The potato should 
not be too moist, 
just moist enough to 
flow through a star 
tube without break- 
ing. On a buttered 
baking-sheet spread 
thin rounds of po- 
tato, then pipe more 
potato on to these to 
form cases. Simply 
build with stars of 
potato, as if using 
burrs for a basket. 
Brush over the cases 
with beaten yolk of 
egg, and set into a 
hot oven until the 
edges are browned. 
Remove with a spatula to individual 
plates, iill with the chicken mixture, 
and serve at once.

powdered sugar over the peaches, and 
serve at once with a pitcher of cream. 

Peach Cup 

Pare and stone enough peaches to 
make a pint of pulp when the fruit is 
pressed through a sieve or potato ricer. 
To this pulp add one cup of sugar, the 
juice of a lemon, and one pint of 
rich cream. Freeze as any ice-cream. 
Have ready, chilled, four or five choice, 
mellow peaches. Pare and* cut these 
in small pieces. Add two oranges, 
chilled, peeled, seeded, and cut in small 
pieces, and two small, very ripe bananas, 
peeled, scraped, and cut in small pieces 
of uniform size. Mix the fruit with one- 
third a cup of sugar. Part of a very 
ripe pineapple may be used instead of 
the bananas. While it adds to the 
expense of the dish, the combination 
of flavors is particularly agreeable. 
Put a tablespoonful of fruit in the bot- 
tom of 3, flaring champagne or a tall 
wine glass, and over it dispose a spoon- 
ful or more of the peach ice-cream. 
Finish with fine-chopped pistachio 
nuts or a maraschino cherry.

Prepare the fruit as above. Make 
a peach sherbet of a cup and a half of 
peach pulp, the juice of three oranges 
and one lemon, and the syrup made by 
boiling one quart of water and one pint 
of sugar twenty minutes. Have the 
syrup cold before the fruit juice is 
added to it. Beat one cup of cream, 
three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a 



teaspoonftd of vanilla until firm. Put 
the fruit in the glass, cover with a large 
spoonful of sherbet, and pipe a liftle of 
the cream above. 

Peach Cocktail 

Have ready choice peaches, thor- 
oughly chilled. Pare, cut into length- 
wise slices, and these into two or three 
pieces. Sprinkle lightly with pow- 
dered sugar, a little syrup from a jar 
of vanilla or lemon marrons or with 
cold, sugar syrup. Add maraschino 
or Kirsch at discretion. Into chilled 
champagne glasses or sherbet cups 
put one preserved chestnut (marron). 
Over this put a spoonful of the pre- 
pared peaches, and serve at once. The 
peaches should not be very sweet. 

Cucumbers Romaine 

Peel two large green cucumbers. 
Cut them in quarters, discarding the 
seed portion, then slice . into salted 
water. Let stand fifteen or twenty 
minutes, then drain, and set to cook in 
boiling water. Prepare a cup of to- 
mato sauce, using two tablespoonfuls, 
each, of butter and flour, one-fourth 
a teaspoonful of salt, and one cup of 
tomato purte. When the cucumbers 
have cooked half an hour, drain, rinse 
in cold water, and drain again. In a 
buttered au gratin dish put a little 
sauce. Add half the cucumbers, 
sprinkle them with salt and pepper, and 
two tablespoonfuls or more of grated 
Parmesan or othei^ cheese. Add a little 
more sauce, the rest of the cucumbers, 
with seasoning and cheese, then the 
rest of the sauce. Stir half a cup of 
cracker crumbs into three tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter, and spread over 
the whole. Let bake about twenty- 
five minutes in a moderate oven. 



Some Mexican Recipes 

By Rose Russeli 



CUT a kid in small pieces, and 
put these into a saucepan in 
which are two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and one of lard made 
very hot. Add two tomatoes and one 
onion chopped very fine, two cloves, 
half a small bay leaf, two teaspoonfuls 
of salt and one of pepper. Cover very 
tight, and let cook until tender, which 
will be in about one hour. Then add 
a cup of hot water, and thicken with 
flour. Serve with boiled rice. If toma- 
toes are not procurable, use about half 
a teaspoonful of vinegar. 

Another good way, which makes a dish 
very like fried chicken, is to cut the kid 
in small pieces, and let soak in strongly 
salted water for an hour; wipe each 
piece carefully, dredge with flour, and 
fry in plenty of lard until a golden 
brown. It must be fried slowly, to be 
cooked thoroughly, and, when served 
with milk gravy, is a perfect substitute 
for fried chicken. Diluted condensed 
cream may be used for the gravy. 

All goat meat, with the exception of 
kid, should be soaked in salted Water, in 
which is a little vinegar, for about an 
hour. Then put on to cook in fresh 
water, in which are a pinch of soda, a 
small stick of cinnamon, and a few 
cloves. By this treatment all the ob- 
jectionable strong flavor is eliminated. 

Goat meat can be cooked in any of 
the ways mutton is cooked except 
roasting. It is too tough for roasting. 
Two very good ways are the pot roast 
and Irish stew. 

For the first about three or four 
pounds of the thick part of the leg is 
best. Put in a saucepan with a whole 
onion, tomato, and piece of garlic. 
Cover close, and let brown on all sides. 



When brown, add enough water to 
nearly cover it, about two teaspoonfuls 
of salt, and a few pepper-corns. Cover, 
and cook until the water is reduced one- 
half. The meat will be tender then. 
Take up the meat, thicken the gravy, 
strain, and pour it over the meat. 

For Irish stew take about three or 
four pounds of the meat, cut in pieces, 
and stew until nearly tender. Add 
about three large potatoes, cut in 
quarters, and two large onions, cut 
small, which have been previously 
boiled in two waters, salt and pepper to 
taste, — also one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
thyme, sage, or marjoram. Marjoram 
is the best, but sage can always be 
procured. 

In these last recipes let it be re- 
membered that the meat must be pre- 
pared first by soaking and boiling a 
little while, as previously indicated. 

When pots are covered, the meat 
becomes tender more quickly. 

The best way to cook dried meat is 
to soak it in water three or four hours. 
Then cut it into two-inch pieces. Stew 
these in a very little water until soft- 
ened ; then shred, put in a frying-pan 
with a little lard or butter, a small 
chopped onion, tomato, and piece of 
green pepper. Brown slightly; add 
suflicient water to moisten well, pepper 
and salt to taste, and cook half an hour. 
Pour over toast or fried bread. A little 
milk, butter, or condensed cream, is an 
addition. 

Another way is to beat three eggs ; 
add one cup of shredded meat, pepper 
and salt, and a little chopped onion. 
Then cook like scrambled eggs. 

In all these recipes, if onions are not 
to be had, use a very little garlic.

After Breakfast Chat 



By Janet M. Hill 



o much the rate of speed in 



s in the ability to make each it 



SOME one writes: ' 'Do tell us how 
to get along without cooking in 
summer. Give us some menus 
for meals that will satisfy our families, 
and yet will not compel us to have a 
fire three times a day." We will try 
and give some suggestions that may 
help lighten summer cooking; but does 
our subscriber really wish to eliminate 
all cooking in summer ? Let her make 
the case her own. If she were going 
away to board for a month in summer, 
where would she choose to go, — to a 
' 'paper-bag housekeeper" or to a place 
where, an ample vegetable garden, 
chickens, and Jerseys were kept? In- 
deed, of two places in the country, 
one with a woodpile in the background, 
the other with yawning woodshed and 
no wood in evidence, which would she 
prefer? 

A young woman of foreign birth, 
wife of an artist, whose ideas on prac- 
tical, every-day matters were extremely 
limited, — noting a private kitchen 
equipped with coal and gas ranges, — said 
in her earnest foreign tone: ' 'You 
have more than your share of cook- 
ing-stoves. I have none." "But you 
board, do you not?" ' 'Oh, no, we live 
in the studio." * 'But how do you 
cook?" "We do not cook: we have 
salads, olive oil, lettuce, and figs; but 
sometimes I do not wish oil, and would 
like to have a stove.' ' 



People do not require as much food 
or as heavy food in summer as in 
winter, but even in the family of two 
the getting of the meals must be made 
the business of some one who will give 
it due amount of attention in winter and 
in summer. 

Give thought to the planning of the 
meals. When a cool day comes, take 
advantage of it. Cook enough for two 
days. For a change make a pie. It 
is not the season for pastry, perhaps, 
but an apple pie made of early August 
apples will be hailed with enthusiasm 
enough to atone for everything. Plan 
to do the cooking as far as it is practical 
in the early morning. Let the break- 
fast be generous, then the other meals 
may be lighter. It does not take long- 
continued heat to broil a steak or 
fish, scramble eggs, or make an omelet. 
Don't forget to include the element of 
surprise in your meals. If hot tea be 
the common occurrence, have well- 
made iced tea (iced by contact with 
ice, not by putting ice into it) when 
a particularly hot day comes. Don't 
ask if it will be acceptable. Unless you 
know it is positively distasteful, try it. 

Bread and biscuit mixed at night, 
using one-third a cake of compressed 
yeast to a pint of liquid, may be baked 
while breakfast is being cooked, and, 
so great is the satisfaction of know- 
ing there is good wholesome bread in

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



the house, one should not begrudge 
the few minutes of time and the fire 
needed to get things ready at night, 
nor the hotu: of baking in the morning. 
A small kerosene stove is not a costly 
article, and it comes in most handily 
when a little milk or water is to be 
heated quickly. After one has become 
accustomed to the use of gas or elec- 
tricity in cooking, the motions necessary 
to produce heat by kindling a wood 
fire seem burdensome, and the time 
consumed makes one question if the 
result be worth while. 

Really the one thing needful is not 
so much menus, which at best can be 
only suggestive, as brains and a willing- 
ness to use them in planning short cuts 
in our work. One should spend many 
hours of these summer days in the open 
air, and it can be done with fourfold 
pleasture, if one be filled with the con- 
sciousness that the meals of the day 
have been fittingly planned for. Of 
course, it takes time to get meals — 
even well-planned ones — onto the 
table. We have heard women say 
that a meal for four people should be 
prepared in twenty minutes; but the 
woman who does her own work, day in 
and day out, and wishes to avoid hurry 
and come to the table in a proper state 
of mind and body to partake of the 
meal which she has prepared, should 
allow one hour for dinner and three- 
quarters of an hour for the other meals 
of the day. Then without undue haste 
(sometimes, not always) the dishes used 
in preparing the m^ can be washed 
while the meal is being prepared, and 
the after-meal work need not be 
dreaded. 

Know what you are going to do before 
you enter the kitchen, then go straight 
to the mark without dallying. Fuel 
and precious time are often wasted, 
while one is trying to make up her mind 
what she will do. Then, worn out in 
trying to find something easy to make, 
calling for nothing tangible in the way 
of ingredients gnd little cooking, the 



matter is given up, and the grocer is 
telephoned to bring something in the 
inevitable paper bag. We fail to see 
any satisfaction in this kind of house- 
keeping. Housekeeping is a business 
to be conducted in summer and in 
winter. To be always equal to it, take 
a holiday often and give the same to 
those in your employ. Ddnot stagnate. 
Initiate new projects in your business. 
Rejoice in it.. Avoid overwork and 
overheat, but keep up your interest . 
We love those people and things for 
which we expend our e£Forts. 



Though August gives us only a hint 
of the good things October has in store 
for us, it is itself a month of volup- 
tuous plenty. The whole country 
revels in tomatoes and peaches, and 
the heat of the summer sun, which 
has given the tomato its vivid red and 
the peach its delicate pink-and-white 
tints, has supplied therein all the cook> 
ing needful. Let the cooking of these 
be but for diversity in serving and for 
preservation, when their season is past. 

Apples — ^August Sweets, Early Au- 
gusts. Marguerites, and Red Astrakhans 
— are ripe, and very welcome are they 
after a long absence. For a ten o'dodc 
luncheon, when the little folk are 
clamoring for a cake, give them nicely 
pared, mellow apples, and at night for 
supper have ready well-prepared apple 
sauce, if heating the oven be an im- 
pediment to baked apples. In the 
country, cottage cheese may be had 
for the making. This che^e, rich in 
protein, with cooked apples and bread, 
and, perchance, a cup of milk or cocoa, 
will furnish many a hearty, tempting 
meal, with a minimiun of work and heat. 
Pears, plums, and grapes, all at their 
best uncooked, tempt us to forget 
for the moment the luscious canta- 
loupe and showy watermelon, now 
in their glory. It were certainly a 
culinary sin to cook any of these al- 
ready ripened to perfection ; for cook- 
ing and hpening are synonymous. In 



My Mother's Cooky Jar

vegetables, celery and sweet pota- 
toes, egg plant, cauliflower, green 
peppers, Lima and cranberry beans,' 
with sweet com, will tempt us to 
light the fire that softens cellulose 
and brings out flavor and richness. 
In September the white-meated par- 
tridge, a favorite bird both in history 
and fiction, though not for sale in the 
^market, is plentiful in the country. 
Who would not build a fire and keep 
it, too (often a more serious matter 
than the building, wood being the fuel 
at hand), when roast partridge are to 
appear as the result of the effort ? In- 
deed, if the partridge be young, 
drawn with care, and kept just the 
right length of time, I fancy you will 
consider it no great labor to select 
your wood with careful eye> and, when 
the flame from the oak or maple sticks 



has passed up the chimney, and left 
a deep bed of glowing coals, you will 
desire to try your hand at broiling. 
If you have rolls and a mayonnaise of 
crisp lettuce and cool tomatoes to eat 
with them, you will not care for soup 
before or dessert after, and will think 
the building of the fire a small matter 
in exchange for such a dinner. 

Partridge with cabbage, a dish of 
much renown, we will show later, 
when the lucky sportsman's bag is 
opened. Partridge pie needs only the 
hand of an ordinary cook. It can 
scarcely be spoiled in the making. 
With young partridge, cream and 
butter a-plenty, even the amateur can 
evolve a masterpiece. For variety, 
Spanish peppers, mushrooms, or truflles, 
— the latter soon to be an every-day 
affair in cookery, — ^may be added. 



My Mother's Cooky Jar 



By A. B. Braley 



In a dim old country pantry where the light 

just sifted through, 
Where they kept the pies and spices and the 

jam and honey, too, 
Where the air was always fragrant with the 

smell of things to eat, 
And the coolness was a refuge from the burn- 
ing summer heat, — 
It was there I used to find it, when I went to 

help myself, — 
That old cooky jar a-setting underneath the 

pantry shdf . 
Talk of manna straight from heaven! Why, it 

isn't on a par 
With those good old-fashioned cookies from 

my mother's cooky jar. 

They were crisp and light and flaky ; they had 
lots of sugar on; 

And I think the way they tasted that the foun- 
tains of the dawn 

Had been robbed to give them flavor, and the 
sweetness of the South 

Had been kneaded in them somehow, for they 
melted in your mouth. 



How I used to eat those cookies when I came 

in from my play! 
Yet the jar was never empty, spite of all I put 

away. 
Oh, the "days that were" were better than 

dyspeptic days that are, 
And I wish I had a cooky from my mother's 

cooky jar! 

I am sick of fancy cooking; I am weary of the 

ways 
Of the butler and the waiters. Give me back 

my boyhood days! 
Give me back the good old kitchen, with its 

roominess and light. 
Where the farm hands did their "sparking" 

almost every winter night! 
Give me back my boyhood hunger and the 

things my mother made! 
Give me back that well-filled pantry where I 

used to make a raid! 
Take me back, as though forgetting all the 

years whidi mark and mar — 
Let me taste once more the cookies from my 

mother's cooky jar! 



School Lunches 



By Kate Gannett Wells 



THE present typical school 
lunch is as much a part of 
hygienic evolution as any other 
vital school improvement. Time was 
when our masculine forbears scorned 
any simple lunch, while our mothers 
secretly stuffed the pockets of their 
children with goodies. But, with the 
paper-bag age, lunches began to im- 
prove, and with the era of cheap paper 
boxes they even took on an air of ele- 
gance. Still, they all had to be carried 
from home, unless the comer grocery 
really was round the comer from school, 
which quite as often was located in a 
clearing. 

Just when or how the school lunch 
began to establish itself in the school 
building no one dares to aver, lest, 
if one city or town claim its origin, 
dispute arise. What matters it if 
the lunch-room and its accessories has 
become universal! 

But it hasn't. It exists only in a few 
big cities, in enterprising towns and 
kindly minded villages. In its best 
estate it is a school adjunct of immense 
importance. First of all, the school 
lunch must have a locality of its own, 
preferably not in the basement, where 
it is generally found for economical 
reasons. It also must have tables 
and seats of its own, and the tables 
should be covered with white enamel 
cloth, and the seats should not be chairs; 
lest their backs get broken! To such 
lunch-room, in some places, the pupils 
bring their own supplies, put up at 
home, while another room may furnish 
only chocolate or soup, and still another 
may have a buffet lunch. Any lunch- 
room, however, in order to fulfil even 
a tithe of its duty, should furnish at 
least a hot cup of — something. Many 
pupils walk quite a distance to school, 
or, if attending a normal or high school 



elsewhere than in their own towns, 
go by train, leaving their homes any- 
where between 6.30 and 7.30 in the 
morning, which in winter is early and 
cold. These pupils need the hot broth 
or broma that in many schools is made 
on gas stoves by special pupils, who 
in this way are glad to earn a little. 
The usual price for a big cup of soup, 
broma, or chocolate, with two Graham 
biscuit, is five cents. The boys and 
girls carry their filled cups to the lunch 
tables, and with the contents of their 
home boxes have a satisfactory lunch, 
unless the chocolate is too watery ! 

The normal school at Worcester 
excels in its provision for keeping things 
hot by having a very large heater sup- 
plied with shelves, where the girls 
can warm over what they bring, or 
cook eggs, heat milk, etc. The care 
of the many tables is assigned to differ- 
ent pupils, who make them attractive 
with flowers or shrubs that afterwards 
can be used in the botanical lesson. 
Most schools prefer to have a regular 
lunch counter from which is dispensed 
the menu of the day. On the gas stove 
is the ubiquitous soup or broma, that, 
with various kinds of bread and fruit, 
sandwiches, and corn-cakes, fturnishes a 
lunch that hungry children will eat, 
but not the appetizing one which older 
pupils prefer. At the Normal Art 
School, Boston, the superintendent of 
the lunch-room sets forth from ten 
to fifteen dishes each day, — always 
chocolate and soup, delicate sandwiches 
of all kinds, fish or meat pie in individ- 
ual dishes, baked tomato or rice, baked 
macaroni, custards, jeUies, delicious 
salads, ice-cream, cake, and fruit. 
Nothing costs more than eight cents, 
most dishes cost but five cents, and one 
has a limch to one's fastidious or hearty 
liking. Many of the Boston schools are 



School Lunches 



lOI 



excellently supplied from the **New 
England Kitchen," thus relieving the 
principal of all care. 

The way in which menus differ ac- 
cording to locaUty is an entertaining 
lesson in nationalities. Ke, however, 
is seldom seen anywhere, though Eclairs 
are in frequent evidence. The thick 
sandwich with its tasteless chicken 
or spiced ham is no longer considered 
"elegant" by girls, while boys yet 
crave them. 

A most perfect equipment of a lunch- 
room is found in the new high school 
at Rochester, N.Y. Almost the whole 
basement is given up to it. Every- 
thing except bread is cooked there, — 
hams and other meats, soups, vege- 
tables, cake, etc. All are admirably 
set forth. The regular corps of cooks 
is present, all and every day, reinforced 
at the noon hour by waitresses and 
special pupils. Twelve or fifteen him- 
dred are served each day, for the ar- 
rangements are so pleasant and the 
food so good that the college boys 
near by lunch at the high school. 
The superintendent oversees each de- 
tail of cooking, serving, book-keeping. 
Accounts, or the making both ends 
meet, present the real problem in 
school lunches. Prices must be low and 
food must taste well, or no one wiU 
partake. Yet, since prices have gone 
up, it is difficult to maintain lunches at 
their former high level. Much depends 
on who manages. When one concern 
sends to many schools, imiformity of 
taste has to be guaranteed, and it can- 
not be. When the Itmch superin- 
tendent runs the limch-room as she 
would her own house, it is on a profit- 
and-loss basis to herself. If she is 
keen at a bargain, sees to the cooking 
herself, offers delightful surprises in 
new dishes, and sells at a minimum, 
she can make from $20 to $30 a 
week, provided she does not pay for 
rent, heat, dishes, or labor, and has at 
least two himdred hungry boys and 
girls to feed. If she has young men 



and women, she will not make as much, 
unless there are five or six hundred 'of 
them, when she will be likely to receive 
a salary. No school should run a 
Itmch-room for its own profit, but it 
may rightly make up losses when ex- 
penses are not met out of receipts. 
Yet a skilled superintendent will not 
let such disaster occur. 

Some persons advocate free lunches, 
at least for little children. No doubt 
they would be better in health for just 
a free glass of milk. But one cannot 
begin on the smallest lunch or cheapest 
free milk without increasing the pater- 
nalism that eventually lessens self-de- 
pendence. Parents already expect too 
much from schools. If health is to be 
added to the education and character 
that they are to supply, clothes will have 
to be bestowed as well as food. They 
are very often, but by individuals, free 
lunches often being thus given. The 
State already provides so much which 
is free that parentage, after all, is not 
as costly as it ought to be, in order to 
make parents realize their responsibil- 
ities. 

The five cents asked for the cup of 
soup or glass of milk has been lowered to 
three and two cents in some schools. 
Better put the price at half a cent or 
two glasses for one cent than give it 
free. 

Women who want to do something 
for the schools could send in home- 
made luxiuies, and women who are on 
school boards or committees will grow 
ingenious in devising plans for school 
lunches. Then there is ever so much 
pleasure in raising the level of taste 
and of good manners at table. Have, 
the lunch crockery pretty, though 
strong. Introduce paper napkins. 
Rebel at orange peel and banana skins 
left on tables. Insist on return of 
forks, spoons, and ttunblers. Do not

gest Cooking-School Magazine ideas to 
the school lunch-room, and see how 
quickly they are adopted because of 
their freshness and economy. 

Then the reward will be in the in- 
creased vigor of the pupils, and the 
committee member will not have to go 



home to dream of tired faces, thin 
frames, and puny wrists. The lunclt-

But keep its menus separate from school

continue on its way rejoicing. 



Aunt Matilda 



Miss Fashion wears a stylish frock, with many 

a plait and frill; 
A myriad tiny tucks display the artist's subtle 

skiU. 
Her outlines shock anatomy, such wondrous 

curves they show, 
And by an eerie miracle she's concave to her 
toe. 
I marvel, but cannot admire : 

My longing fancy flies 
Back to the days of long ago, 
And feasts enamoured eyes 
Upon a form in rich brocade 

That charmed of old the town; 
For art and beauty blent their grace 
In Aunt Matilda's gown« 

Miss Fashion's locks are trussed and pu£fed, 

to heaven they aspire. 
With rolls and cushions underneath they 

scarcely could be higher; 
Yea, oft at balls and operas, although her 

face is fair, 
Her features seem a mannikin's beneath that 
weight of hair. 
It was not so in olden days, 

I would that you could see 
A portrait on my study wall 
That archly smiles at me; 
Two curls that hang on either cheek 

Its dimpled charms caress, — 
No cushion's bulk flamboyant strains 
My Aunt Matilda's tress. 

Miss Fashion's partners hie in throngs; but 

have you seen her dance 
Across the floor, as long as four the two-step's 

dashing prance ? 
Male beauty may be strenuous, but woman 

should not haste, 
And motions so rectangular no maiden ever 

graced. 



Alas! if modem belles and beaux 

A moment could but cast 
Their supercilious eyes behind 

And view the courtly past. 
One guerdon fine the glance would gain 

They never could regret, — 
My stately Aunt Matilda as 

She danced the minuet. 



Miss Fashion hath mudi sprightliness,- 

so, at least, I've heard, — 
Her repartee, as all agree, flits nimble as a 

bird. 
And, though its tone is seldom soft, by mirth 

'tis always crowned: 
Perhaps it is the noise about that makes her 
voice resound; 
I know not. Yet I've known a day — 

Its modes are now disdained — 
When women quite as bright of mind 

Spoke with an accent trained. 
With voice quite low one dame I know 

Whose arrows always hit, 
And troops of gallants sat entranced 
By Aunt Matilda's wit. 

Miss Fashion sports a chafing-dish, and no 

man dare refuse 
The dainties most mysterious that skilfully 

she stews. 
Above the smoking caldron's brim enchant- 

ingly she beams, — 
Who would not brave the contents dire, re- 
gardless of his dreams I 
Alackaday! I call to mind 
In times agone a maid 
The culinary powers of whom 

Far wider art displa3red. 
I doubt not that the olden gods 

Olympus had forsook 
To taste one of the dinners Aunt 
Matilda used to cook. 

Samuel MifUwm Peck, in the Transcript, 



A Good Breakfast Dish 

CODPtSa SUPRBHB 

SHRED fine and free from all bone 
and .- stringy fibre some codfish. 
Freshen to taste by soaking. Drain, 
and press out all the water. 

To a cup of the well-pressed fish add 
a cup of fresh eggs. Beat together 
until they are well mixed. 

Have a skillet or griddle moderately 
hot, with a good spoonful of dripping 
in. If not that, use butter. Drop by 
spoonfuls. Let cook until they will 
turn the same as pancakes. They will 
cook in about the same time as pan- 
cakes, and should be a pale, dainty 
brown. I never have seen any one 
who did not Uke them, even if he did 
not eat codfish in any other form. 

A frying material for this and many 
other things that is economical and 
preferable to butter, as it does not 
scorch so easily, is made by taking the 
fresh fat trimmings from steak or any 
part of beef, the fat of boiled beef, and 
the fat cake from the soup stock made 
the day before the soup is wanted. 
Put all in a skillet, add a cup of water 
or more according to the quantity, and 
let oook slowly until the wat^ is 
boiled away. As soon as it is still, 
so that a drop of water added makes 
it sputter, strain through cheese-cloth, 
and it will be free from all specks and 
ready for use. It must not be fried 
out, or it will have a disagreeable 
flavor, which it will impart to anything 
cooked in it. B. a. s. 



COLD biscuit may be acceptably 
warmed over for lunch as follows : 
Cut in two, butter lightly, and spread 
with grated cheese, seasoned with a 
sprinldingof red pepper. Put together, 
and, without moistening, heat in the 
oven until crisp.

Desserts Made with Gelatine 

FEW housekeepers realize the possi- 
bilities of gelatine,^ what a number 
of easily prepared, delicious, and digest- 
ible desserts may be made from it. 

These may be divided into three 
classes, — the simple jellies, the sponges 
made with eggs, and the various creams. 
Proceed on the genera! principle of a 
tablespoonful of granulated gelatine to 
a pint of Uquid, soaked in enough cold 
water to cover it. Then dissolve by 
the addition of boiling water. 

Let us take a number of desserts that 
may be made with oranges. They are 
not only good, but in the spring, when 
the appetite needs stimulating, they 
are especially tempting. Orange jelly 
is, no doubt, familiar to all. This same 
dish may be changed to a delicate, 
foamy "sponge" by the addition of the 
whites of two eggs to a pint of the jelly. 
They must be added just as the jelly 
begins to thicken. If put in sooner, a 
different effect still is obtained. Two 
layers are shown, the whites rising to 
the top. 

A very different and most deUcious 
sponge is made by the addition of the 
yolks, too. It is so nice, I give the

redpe in full. The juice of six oranges 
and one lemon, four eggs, one cup of 
sugar, half a package of gelatine in a 
cup of water. Squeeze the oranges and 
lemon, and strain the juice on the sugar. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs. Add the 
sugar and orange juice, and cook in 
the double boiler until it begins to 
thicken. Then add the gelatine. Take 
from the fire, and, when the mixture 
begins to thicken, add the well-beaten 
whites of the eggs. When almost too 
thick to pour, turn into a mould that 
has been wet with cold water. It is 
important that the whites be added 
promptly when the mixture cools, 
that it may be smooth and delicate and 
not streaky. ♦ 

These recipes are all good used with 
other fruit juice instead of orange juice. 
A lemon jelly poured over a cup of 
strawberries, left from a previous meal, 
or a mixtiu-e of fruits or even prunes 
makes an economical and simple des- 
sert. 

An almost unlimited number of good 
creams or charlottes may be made with 
gelatine and whipped cream . The cream 
may be flavored with vanilla, sherry, 
fruits, nuts, chocolate, or an3rthing one 
pleases. Proceed as in the foregoing 
recipes. Soak a tablespoonful of gran- 
ulated gelatine for a pint of liquid. 
When dissolved, add enough boiUng 
water to melt it. Some recipes advise 
the use of milk, but water is better, 
as there is no danger of its curdling, and 
the cream will be rich enough, anyway. 
When it is cool, stir it into the wWpped 
cream, sweetened and flavored to taste. 
It may be poured into a large mould or 
into cups or individual moulds, and may 
be garnished or not as one prefers. 
Strawberry cream is very attractive, 
garnished with the whole berries and 
whipped cream, and orange cream with 
sections of the oranges. A spray of 
asparagus is a dainty garnish for the 
white creams, and whipped cream may 
be used with any of them. 

Nuts added to a vanilla cream make 



a deUdous but very rich dessert. 
Shredded pineapple made tart with a 
little lemon juice is a nice flavor. 
Marshmallows and candied cherries are 
not only delidous, but decorative in a 
vanilla or cherry cream. 

Lastly, a combination of two or more 
gelatines may be made, as orange jelly 
and vanilla cream, raspberry and plain 
cream, lemon jelly and pineapple cream, 
the tartness of one combining most 
deUghtfully with the sweetness of the 
other. Allow the first layer to become 
almost soHd before putting on the next, 
which should be thick, but not firm. 
If it should become too firm, melt a 
little by setting over a pan of hot water.

Grape Conserve 

THREE pints of grapes, seeded, eight 
cups of sugar, one-half a pound of 
raisins, the juice of two oranges, one 
pint of water, one cup of EngUsh wal- 
nuts. Pulp the grapes. Cook, and 
remove seeds by pressing through col- 
lander. Then put in all ingredients 
except the walnuts, and cook twenty 
minutes. Add nuts just before taking 
from fire. 

Simple Puddings for Every Day 

Plain Ricb 

PUT two tablespoonfids of washed 
rice, three tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and a little salt into a bean-pot. Add 
one quart of cold milk, and bake, un- 
covered, four or five hours in a good 
oven, or inside the feed door of the 
furnace, with moderate fire. It bakes 
more quickly in the furnace. 

Unsweetened Bread Pudding 

Soak one cup of stale bread 
crumbs (or toast crumbs) in one 
and a half cups of cold milk for half 
an hour. Add salt, one large table- 
spoonful of butter, melted, one quarter 



Home Ideas and Economies

a cup of raisins or chopped dates, 
and one beaten egg. Turn into the 
double boiler, and steam two hours 
or more. Serve with a very sweet 
sauce, as the following, for instance: 
Beat one fresh egg two minutes. Add 
one-half a cup of powdered sugar, and 
beat three minutes more. Flavor with 
one teaspoonful of sherry. This is 
best when made just before serving. 

Hominy 

Let one-half a cup of whole hominy 
soak over night. Cook in the double 
boiler, in three cups of hot water, three 
or more hours. Serve with cream and 
sugar. Pearl barley is very nice cooked 
the same way, only it needs three and a 
half cups of water, as it swells more 
than hominy or rice. SERENa. 






Brown Bread with Nuts for Sand- 
wiches 

I FIND that a cup of walnut meats, 
chopped as for cake and stirred 
into the dough for a loaf of steamed 
brown bread, makes the bread espe- 
cially good for sandwiches. Royal 
cheese, or cooked egg, chopped and sea- 
soned, makes a good filling. 

A New Tomato Jelly 

I heat two cups of a good chili sauce 
with half a cup of hot water, and strain 
over a tablespoonful of gelatine, soft- 
ened in one-fourth a cup of cold water, 
and thus have a very good and quickly 
made tomato jelly.

The Cost of Living 

** T^O you really think it is safe for 
-L/people to marry on a thousand 
or twelve hundred a year?'* asked a 
bright-faced woman at a luncheon 
recently. "Can it be done safely?" 

And the answer came from a quiet, 
thoughtful little woman: **It all de- 



pends upon the view-point of the in- 
terested parties. I have demonstrated 
that it can be done for half that sum, 
and done comfortably and well for a 
family of three. 

'* After several years of study abroad, 
where we had spent considerable money, 
my husband, little boy, and self re- 
turned to our home city. 

* * We werp not ready to build the new 
house, neither could we content our- 
selves in a boarding-house, and we felt 
the need of economizing. 

**I felt that we could Uve on $50 per 
month, and was anxious to make the 
trial. So, taking a small four-room 
flat, for which we paid $25 per month, 
we started in. 

"To be sure, we were well supplied 
with clothing for a year, and our $50 a 
month did not cover amusements or 
books; and, besides, the cost of living 
ten years ago was much less than it is 
to-day. 

"The first week I was restless, but, 
after I had simplified and arranged our 
scale of living, everything moved as 
smoothly as clock-work. 

"Never a week went by in which we 
did not entertain at least one guest 
at dinner or supper, and sometimes 
more; but I never permitted our en- 
tertaining to increase our expenses. 

"It was a most enjoyable experience 
to me, and one that will never be for- 
gotten, for I was able to prove m)^elf 
equal to the emergency."

MY favorite oversleeves for house- 
work are cut from an old under- 
shirt. They cHng well at the wrist, 
stay up well over the sleeve, and are 
easily washed. I save all my under- 
sleeves for this purpose. 

I had a great deal of trouble with 
window screens until a carpenter told 
me to rub the strips well with lard. I 
now anoint all the edges of window

screens and sashes at least once a year, 
and have no more trouble. 

We like oiu: tea and coflfee very hot, 
and always use an English tea-cosey. 
We also use a little pad of felt or flannel 
on the tile, and find it less trouble and 
safer for the table than wanning the 
tile. 

I made an excellent bread rack for 
cooling my bread and cake from a 
narrow window screen, which was never 
really needed for that particular win- 
dow. The frame was firm and strong, 
and I bought four smooth white picture 
knobs and screwed them into the frame, 
one at each comer, for feet, to raise it 
from the table, and thus sectue a 
thorough ventilation of cool air. I 
spread a napkin over the wire, turn my 
bread, cake, etc., directly upon this with 
the most satisfactory results. When 
not in use, the rack hangs on a hook in 
the pantry. 

My pantry window was a problem for 
some time. The sash-blind would blow 
in onto my milk and puddings whenever 
I opened the window, and tacking it 
down at the bottom only served to 
tear the muslin. At last I hit upon the 
plan of sewing the muslin onto the win- 
dow screen, stretching it smoothly 
across, and basting it through the wire 
all around close to the frame. It looks 
neat both outside and in, and serves to 
keep the dust out when the window is 
open. 

I have an insuperable objection to 
the odor of shoes in my closet, and yet 
never found a satisfactory receptacle 
for them tmtil this winter. I searched 
the town till I found a packing-case 
about four feet long by one foot wide 
and deep, with a good cover. My hus- 
band put cleats on the inner side of the 
cover for me, neat little casters under 
each corner, and, after I had covered it, 
hinges at the back. I lined the whole 



box with glazed cambric and covered 
the outside with handsome cretonne, 
to match my room, arranging it in 
box-plaits all along the front and ends, 
leaving the back plain, and tacking it 
on with brass-headed nails. The cover 
is plain, with a Uttle tab at each end 
to lift it by. This pretty shoe box I 
placed at the foot of my bed, and ar- 
ranged the shoes in a row within. Now, 
when I throw back the bedclothes to 
air the bed, they fall harmlessly on the 
nice clean surface of my long box.-

TO avoid monotony and to be eco- 
nomical at the same time is a 
problem which most housewives find 
difficult to solve in making their selec- 
tion of food for the daily menu. Change 
and variety may be acquired, to a great 
extent, by introducing dishes made 
from left-overs. This method is eco- 
nomical also. Some people do not 
believe in buying or preparing food to 
leave any surplus; but the saving house- 
wife often plans her menu so there shall 
be a smplus stock, and uses the same to 
advantage in making up her menu for 
the following day. 

The first set of menus given below 
shows how economy, change, and 
variety were secured by the judicious 
use of left-overs, for it can be seen that 
there was not much extra stuff used in 
preparing Monday's list. 

The chicken left from Sunday's din- 
ner was chopped, a cream gravy made, 
and served on toast for Monday's 
breakfast. 

Salmon croquettes were made from 
the salmon and potatoes that were left 
from Sunday. 

The orange sherbet was made from 
the juice of three oranges left from the 
half-dozen purchased for breakfast the 
previous day. 

Nuts, celery, radishes, and tomatoes 
were prepared for salad. This was put 
on lettuce leaves, and tomato dressing

made from the remainder of a can of 
tomatoes, opened to make the soup, was 
served instead of a mayonnaise. 

To make the berry pudding, a plain 
cornstarch was made, and the juice of 
the preserved berries, put through a 
sieve, was used instead of milk. This 
pudding was served with ' whipped 
cream. 

Even the plain boiled potatoes had 
been cut up into dice, cream being added, 
together with a little flour, thus making 
the delicious creamed potatoes served 
for Sunday night supper. 

The second set of menus was pre- 
pared so there would be scarcely any 
surplus. Everything used to make up 
Monday's list was bought especially for 
that day.

By comparing the sums expended in 
preparing the two sets of menus, it can 
be seen that about 50 cents were saved 
in the set where foods were bought and 
prepared in such quantities as to insure 
a surplus stock, and the same was used 
judiciously. 

Since no menu can be prepared and 
served without having some food left 
over, unless it appears scant and meagre, 
a certain amount of provisions will 
be wasted daily unless left-overs are 
utilized. This seems a small item, but 
at the end of the month it amounts to 
quite a sum. Therefore, it is safe to 
say that a saving of 12 per cent, can be 
made on the menu that is prepared to 
insure a surplus stock, when this is 
used judiciously in the preparation of 
the following day's list.

A Real Watermelon 

LINE a melon mould about one inch 
and a half in depth with pistachio 
ice-cream. Fill the centre with rasp- 
berry or strawberry ice, and arrange 
carefully throughout the ice raisins, 
which have previously been soaked in 
brandy for a few hours, to simulate 
the seeds of the melon. 

Pack for two hours in salt and ice, 
and, when turned from the mould, place 
the flat surface upward. 

The eflFect is startlingly like the 
real melon, and a few of the young 
vine leaves scattered carelessly about 
greatly enhance it. b. p. 

THE following recipe for canning 
small fruits, sent by Grace F. 
DeCamp, Oak Park, 111., deserves a 



trial. We will be pleased to hear of 
results of canning by this method. 

Canning Small Fruits 

Fill jars with perfect fruit and cover 
with cold, boiled water : then seal in tubs 
of water two or three inches under the 
water. After awaiting for all bubbles 
to arise, if any are seen in the jar, open 
and recork, as all of the air must be 
excluded.

Anchovy Paste 

ANCHOVY paste comes now in 
tubes — collapsible tubes — like those 
used for paints and cold cream. An- 
chovy paste is as salt as the Dead 
Sea or Great Salt Lake, but a little of 
it is an appetizer. Especially good is 
it when spread upon crisp buttered 
toast; and often it is used in highly 
seasoned dishes of eggs. Essence of an- 
chovy is used in sauces, and improves 
oyster stews wonderfully. 

The Yale Faculty and the Harvard 
Dental School are favoring Horace 
Fletcher's ideas, and the American 
Magazine has published a life, with a por- 
trait of Mr. Fletcher, who, from being 
a dyspeptic and reftised as a risk by life 
insurance companies, has now become 
a model of health and happiness and 
physical endurance, though almost sixty 
years old. One of his tenets is pro- 
longed mastication. He has elaborated, 
or rather elongated, Gladstone's rule of 
* 'thirty-two chews." The following 
stanzas from the London Punch may 
be based on Fletcher's teachings: — 

The Simplb Lipb. 
There is a road to earthly bliss: 

The secret would you know? 
Five words contain it: it is this, — 

Eat little, and eat slow! 

Or would you that your lot should be 

Celestial happiness? 
'Tis but a question of degree: 

Eat slower still — and less!

QuBRY 1 145. Mrs. E. M. W., Cincinnati, 
Ohio: "When recipes call for 'salt pork,* is 
pickled pork the kind referred to?'' 

" Salt Pork " 

In New England the fat sides of 
pork, cut into strips and cured in a 
brine of salt and water, or salt without 
water, is known as "salt pork." We 
see no reason why the terms "salt" and 
"pickled" pork may not refer to the 
same thing. Especially in the coimtry 
such pork, fifty years ago, was com- 
monly served for breakfast, much as 
bacon is now served. A few small strips 
were cooked with a fricasseed chicken, 
and half a pound or more was cooked 
with corned beef, when a '* boiled din- 
ner" was in progress. 



QuBRY 1 146. — Mrs. . B. S. W., Montana: 
"Give few recipes for canapes. Should they 
be eaten from the fingers or with a knife and 
fork?" 

Lettuce Leaves, Genoese Fashion 

(Appetizer at Dinner or Luncheon) 

Separate the fillets of eight anchovies 
into bits. Add to these two hard- 
cooked eggs, cut in tiny cubes. Season 
with paprika, and mix with enough 
mayonnaise dressing to hold the bits 
together. Select eight small, crisp 
lettuce leaves. (These should not be 
more than two and a half inches in 
length.) Upon ^ach dispose a tea- 



spoonful of the mixture, packing it 
closely, then mask or cover neatly with 
mayonnaise. Decorate with capers, 
chopped beets, and parsley. Serve on 
small plates. If daintily made, these 
are very attractive. 

Sardine or Anchovv flclairs (Cold 
Hors d'CEuvre) 
Prepare choux paste mixture, and, 
using a tube with half-inch opening, 
press the paste on to buttered baking- 
pans in strips about two and one-half 
inches long and three-fourths an inch 
wide. Bake in an oven, with strong 
heat below, tmtil a cake feels light 
when taken up in the hand. When 
cold, split on one side, and fill with the 
following mixture: Pound in a mortar 
half a cup of sardine or anchovy fillets, 
one-fourth a cup of butter, and four 
hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and pass 
through a sieve. Season highly with 
tabasco, salt, if needed, mustard at 
discretion, and a few drops of lemon 
juice, then fold in one-foiu'th a cup 
of whipped cream, measured after 
whipping, and more seasoning, if 
needed. Dip the flat side of each 
6clair into a highly flavored brown or 
tomato chaudfroid sauce, and dec- 
orate with bits of hard-boiled white 
of ^%g or truffle, or with both. Brush 
over with liquid aspic jelly. Serve 
on small plates covered with paper 
doilies.

Ham Croutons (Hot Hors 

d'CEuvrc) 

Stir three-fourths a cup of fine- 
chopped, cold, boiled ham into one- 
third a cup of tomato or Bechamel 
sauce. Add a tablespoonful of butter, 
season highly with tabasco or cayenne, 
mustard, and kitchen bouquet. Spread 
upon small diamonds of hot toast. 
Cover with grated Parmesan cheese, 
surmounted with buttered bread or 
cracker crumbs. Set in a hot oven, to 
brown the crimibs, and serve at once 
'on small plates covered with paper 
doilies. 

Celery Stuffed with Cheese 

A combination of cheeses makes a 
novel stuffing for celery. Equal parts 
of Roquefort, Camembert, and cream 
cheese, are crushed together in a mortar. 
Sherry is added until the mixture is 
of the consistence of thick mayon- 
naise. This is then spread in the 
stalks of celery, which have been previ- 
ously separated and trimmed, if needed,

would have been thought proper some 
years ago. Many canapes cannot be

Boiled Salad Dressing with Whites 

of Egg and Cream 

Mix half a teaspoonful of mustard, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and a gen- 
erous fourth a teaspoonful of paprika. 
Add the yolks of two eggs, and mix 
thoroughly. Add one-fourth a cup of 



butter and one-fourth a cup of dder

Bavarian Cream 

Bavarian creams are complex prep-

and pulp or coffee or milk, flavored 
with caramel, or chocolate. Gelatine, 
and sometimes eggs, also, are used 
for thickening, and whipped cream is 
added in such a manner that the light, 
fluffy texture is retained. Eggs are 
usually employed with a milk founda- 
tion, but may be omitted with milk, 
and used with fruit juice.

To ibis add three-fourths a cup of 
milk. Beat the yolks of three eggs; 
add one-fourth a cup of sugar and a 
few grains of salt, and beat again. 
Then add the hot milk and caramel, 
and stir and cook over hot water until 
the mixture thickens. Add to it half 
a package of gelatine, softened in half 
a cup of cold water. Stir until the gela-

The cream must be added carefully,

cream. 

Pineapple Bavarian Cream 

Scald one pint of grated pineapple. 
Add half a package of gelatine, softened

of half a lemon. Set this mixture into 
a dish of ice and water, and stir until 
it begins to set, then fold in one pint 
of cream, beaten solid, and ttu'n into

cup of cream poured from the top of 
a quart bottle of milk may be used 
for these dishes ; but it will usually take 
longer beating to make these firm than 
when a full pint of thick cream is used. 
The pineapple-gelatine mixture may 
be strained through a cheese-cloth, 
if the pulp be objectionable in the 
dish. 

Cause of Cake Sticking to Sides of 

Pan, etc. 

We see no reason why a cake should 
*' stick" to the sides of the pan if the 
correct proportions of the various in- 
gredients be used, and the pan be well 
buttered. We have seen cakes con- 
taining an excess of sugar and too little 
flour stick to the sides of the pan. 
A cake that is set to bake in too hot an 
oven will crust over before the heat 
has caused the right amotmt of ex- 
pansion. Afterwards, when all the 



batter has been heated, the expansion 
will cause it to puflF up, and burst out, 
perhaps, at the weakest spot, usually 
the middle. Too much flour, by re- 
tarding the passage of heat, will produce 
the same result. 

Pork and Chicken in Chop Suey 

The recipe given in the February, 
1906, magazine was for uncooked meat, 
but, as pork in particular requires long 
cooking, we see no reason why cooked 
meat could not be used. It should, 
however, be left to stand in the sauce, 
over hot water, for an hour or more, 
that it may be thoroughly permeated 
with the flavor of the sauce. When un- 
cooked meat is used, and the dish is 
to be served at noon, the meat must 
be set to cook early in the day.

may be made. Put a few bits of fat 
ham in a frying-pan, let cook slowly 
five or six minutes, then take out the 
soUd pieces, and lay in a slice of tender 
boiled ham. Let cook about two 
minutes or until browned a little. Then 
tiun the ham, and brown the other side 
slightly. Second, put a shce of raw 
ham, from which the skin has been 
taken, in an iron frying-pan, cover it 
with cold water, and let the water 
heat slowly to the boiling-point, then 
drain, and dry the ham on a cloth. 
Dry the frying-pan, and put in the 
ham. Let cook slowly until browned a 
little on one side, then turn the ham to 
brown the other side. Third, put a 
slice of raw ham in a hot frying-pan.

QuBRY 1 1 56. — L. S., Montreal, Canada: 
"Suggestions as to dietary for a man troubled 
with flatulency and uric acid." 

Diet to avoid Flatulency and 

Uric Acid 

Meats — particularly beef — and sweets 
are the chief sources of uric acid. 
Flatulency is largely occasioned (not 
caused) by fried foods, pork in any 
form, red-blooded, salted or smoked 
fish, dried beans, onions, vegetables 
of the cabbage family, pastry, sauces, 
preserves, cheese, and pickles. Coffee, 
particularly when taken with cream 
or sugar, should be added to this list. 
Melons, raspberries, strawberries, and 
tomatoes are among the articles of 
which one can partake and another 
cannot without digestive disturbance. 
Now as to the articles [that may prob- 
ably be eaten: The white varieties 
of fish, broiled or boiled, and sometimes 
baked, if basted with milk or broth 
rather than fat, may be eaten. No 
dressing should be cooked with the 
fish. Use butter melted by the heat of 
the fish for sauce. Eggs carefully 
cooked, but not fried, lamb a year old, 



boiled or broiled and occasi<Mially 
baked, chicken boiled and occasionally 
baked without dressing, are also allow- 
able. The quantity of lamb or chicken 
eaten at one meal should be small. 
Twice a week, at dinner, these, alternated 
with fish as above, will be found ample 
to keep up strength and give variety 
to the dinner. Almonds and pecan 
nuts, if these agree with one, may be 
eaten plain with bread or combined 
with lettuce and fruit with French 
dressing as salad. Oranges, pineapples, 
peaches, dates, figs, cooked prunes 
or pears, or very ripe bananas, may be 
used in these salads. Delicately cooked 
cheese can often be eaten, but do not 
repeat, if the cheese disturbs. Dry 
toast, French bread, Southern beaten 
biscuit, and shredded wheat biscuit, 
toasted, will be found the most satis- 
factory forms of bread. Cereals in 
small quantity can generally be eaten, 
occasionally, if they are well masticated 
and taken without sugar. A little 
cream is better than a quantity of 
milk. Let the cereal be well cooked 
and dry enough to chew. There are 
people who are unable even to taste 
breakfast mushes in any form without 
causing indigestion. 

In vegetables, spinach, lettuce, celery, 
asparagus, green peas, summer squash, 
cooked cucumbers, string beans, and 
white potatoes, baked or boiled, taken 
in moderation, are usually digested 
without trouble. 

Hot water is the best beverage 
for one troubled with flatulency. Sip 
a cup of this half an hour before meals, 
and drink sparingly of it dtu'ing the 
meal.

Didn't Believe 

That Coffee was the Real Trouble 

Some people flounder around, and take 
everything that's recommended, but 
finally find that coffee is the real cause 
of their troubles. An Oregon man says : 

* *For twenty-five years I was troubled 
with my stomach. I was a steady coffee- 
drinker, but didn't suspect that as the 
cause. I took almost anything which 
some one else had been cured with, 
but to no good. I was very bad 
last summer, and could not work at 
times. 

' 'On Dec. 2, 1902, I was taken so bad 
the doctor said I could not live over 
twenty-four hours at the most, and I 
made all preparations to die. I could 
hardly eat anything,— everything dis- 
tressed me ; and I was weak and sick all 
over. When, in that condition, coffee 
was abandoned, and I was put on 
Postum, the change in my feelings 
came quickly after the drink that was 
poisoning me was removed. 

' 'The pain and sickness fell away 
from me, and I began to get well day by 
day, so I stuck to it until now I am 
well and strong again, can eat heartily, 
with no headache, heart trouble, or 
the awful sickness of the old coffee days. 
I drink all. I wish of Postum without 
any harm, and enjoy it immensely. 

' 'This seems like a strong story, but 
I would refer you to the First National 
Bank, the Trust Banking Company, or 
any merchant of Grant's Pass, Ore., 
in regard to my standing; and I will 
send a sworn statement of this if you 
wish. You can also use my name." 
Name given by Postum Company, 
Battle Creek, Mich. 

Still there are many who persistently 
fool themselves by saying, "Coffee 
doesn't hurt me." A ten days' trial of 
Postum in its place will tell the truth 
and many times save life. * 'There's 
a reason."

Set the prepared potatoes, covered 
with cold water, in a cool place for an 
hour or longer. A piece of ice in the 
water is of advantage. When ready to 
fry, drain and dry the potatoes in a soft 
cloth. Fry, a few at a time, to a pale 
amber color. Drain on .soft paper, 
sprinkle with salt, and serve at once. 
The best results will be obtained, other 
things being favorable, when fat that 
has not been previously used for fry-

an attack of what seemed to be la 
grippe, which left me in a complete 
state of collapse, and I suffered for some 
time with nervous prostration. My 
appetite failed, I lost flesh till I was a 
mere skeleton. Life was a burden to me. 
I lost interest in everything and almost 
in everybody save my precious wife. 

' *Then, on the recommendation of 
some friends, I began to use Grape-nuts 
food. At that time I was a miserable 
skeleton, without appetite, and hardly 
able to walk across the room ; had ugly 
dreams at night, no disposition to en- 
tertain or be entertained, and began to 
shun society. 

' 'I finally gave up the regular minis- 
try. Indeed, I could not collect my 
thoughts on any subject, and became 
almost a hermit. After I had been us- 
ing Grape-nuts food for a short time, 
I discovered that I was taking on new 
life, and my appetite began to improve. 
I began to sleep better, and my weight 
increased steadily. I had lost some 
fifty pounds, but under the new food 
regime I have regained almost my 
former weight, and have greatly im- 
proved in every way. 

* 'I feel that I owe much to Grape- 
nuts, and can truly recommend the 
food to all who require a powerful re- 
building agent, delicious to taste, and 
always welcome.'* Name given by 
Postum Company, Battle Creek, Mich. 
A true natural road to regain health or 
hold it is by use of a dish of Grape-nuts 
and cream morning and night. Or 
have the food made into some of the 
many delicious dishes given in the little 
recipe book found in packages. 

Ten days' trial of Grape-nuts helps 
many. * 'There's a reason." 

Look in packages for a copy of the 
famous little book, ' 'The Road to Well- 
ville."

Banana Fritters No. 2 

Sift together one cup and a third of 
flour, one level teaspoonful of baking-

of salt. Beat one egg. Add two- 
thirds a cup of milk, and stir into the 
dry ingredients. Peel and scrape the

Book Reviews 



A Cook-book for Nurses. By Sarah 

C. Hill. Flexible cloth. Price 75 

cents, net. Boston: Whitcomb & 

Barrows. 

Five chapters comprise this manual: 
fluid diet; light, soft diet; soft or con- 
valescent diet; special diets; formulae 
for infant feeding. Menus are given 
for typical diets. 

A condensation of redpes has been 
the author's aim, bringing together in 
tabular form recipes identical in method 
of cooking and dififering in only one or 
two ingredients. 

It may be said of the book that it 
contains neither too much nor too little. 
The author, herself instructor in cooking 
in the Diet School of the Michael Reese 
Hospital of Chicago, prepared the hand- 
book especially for nurses, and it is well 
adapted for the immediate reference 
and use of nurses. 

In no wise, perhaps, is the spirit of 
the age better exemplified than in the 
care of the sick and convalescent. The 
best approved ways in sanitation and 
diet are being widely diffused in hospi- 
tal and home through the land. Books 
on diet, cooking, and hygiene, are of 
steadily increasing importance.

Mrs. Rogen lay in ber bed,

Bandaged and blistered from head to toe, 

Mrs. Rogers was very low. 

Battle and saucers, spoon and cup. 

On the table stood bravely up;

Everything a body could bear 

Excepting light and water and air. 

1 opened the blinds, the day was bright. 

And God gave Mrs. Rogers some light. 

I opened the window, the day was fair. 

And God gave Mrs. Rogers some air. 

Bottles and bhsters, powders and pills. 

Catnip, boneset, syrup and squills. 

Drugs and medicines, high and low, 

I threw them as far as 1 could throw. 

"What are you doingP" my patient cried. 

"Prightemng Death," I coolly replied. 

"You are craiyl" a visitor said. 

I flung a bottle at her bead. 

Deacon Rogers he came to me, 

"Wife is conung round," said he. 

"1 re-lly think she'll worry thru: 

She scolds me just as she used to do. 

All the people have poohed and slurred. 

And the neighbors have had their word : 

'Twaa better to perish, some of 'em say. 

Than be cured in such an irr^idar way." 

"Your wife," said I, "had God's good care. 

And His remedies, — hght, water, and air. 

All the doctors, beyond a doubt. 

Couldn't have cured Mrs. Rogers without." 

The deacon smiled, and bowed his head, 

"Then your bill is nothing," be said.

The Summer Diet 

One reassuring statement as to the 
meat supply coming from Chicago was 
brought out before the agricultural 
committee of the House during the 
recent hearing. This was that none 
of the beef sold while fresh — the 
"cold storage" beef of our summer 
supply — is affected by the improper 
Condi Uons in the packing houses. 
Representative Brooks showed also 
that 92 per cent, of the cattle slaugh- 
tered are sold as fresh meat, leaving 
only 8 per cent, for canning, and that 
practically all the mutton and about 
half the hogs are sold fresh. The 
President's investigators reported 
that the inspection after slaughter 
"appears to be carefully and conscien- 
tiously made." With a little care in 
selecting canned meats there would 
seem to be not much danger in eating 
meat. As a matter of fact, very few 
cases of illness or injury have ever 
been reported from the use of the 
best canned goods, except where 
poison was developed by leaving the 
meat too long in the can after opening. 

But the exposure came at a good 
time, from one point of view. The 
great majority of the city dwellers 
and persons not engaged in hard 
labor out of doors eat much less meat 
in summer than at any other season; 
and many more would no doubt be 
benefited by a less solid and heat- 
producing diet. With the prevalence 
and variety and cheapness of cereals, 
vegetables, and fruit, an abundance 
of fish, fresh and salted, of poultry, 
eggs, milk, and bread, it is not difficult 
to get plenty of agreeable and nourish- 
ing food aside from meat. Persons of 
discernment learn to adapt their diet to 
the state of the weather, as they do 
their clothing. For them there is no 
terror in the "meat scare," which is, 
after all, without substantial founda- 
tion, so far as the great bulk of the 
fresh product consumed by our people 
is concerned, — Boston Herald.

SUMMER 
STRENGTH 

Summer Strewgth comes 
from a summer food — a food 
that supplies in appetizing and 
digestible form the greatest 
amount of nutriment with the 
least tax upon the stomach and 
bowels — a food that is easily 
and quickly prepared in many 
temptmg and dainty ways, giv- 
ing variety to the daily dietary 
at a time when ordinary foods 
pall upon the palate and over- 
tax the digestive powers. 
Such a food is 

Shredded Whole Wheat- 

an all-day food for the invalid, the convalescent, for the outdoor woman and the 
indoor woman, for the woman whose energies have been depleted by the exac~ 
tions of social life or domestic care, for growing children whose bodies demand 
a tissue-building food that does not make them a prey to bowel disorders. 

Shredded Wheat is the cleanest, purest food made on this continent — 
contains more nutriment than meat, is more easily digested, is more economical 
and hence is an ideal summer food. It contains no chemicals or fats, is not 
" treated " or " flavored " with anything ; no " secret process " ; our plant is 
open to the world; over 100,000 visitors last year. 

If you like Shredded Wheat Biscuit for breakfiwt you will like TRISCUIT 
as a Toast for luncheon or for any meal as a substitute for white flour bread. 
An ideal food for flat-dwellers, light-housekeepers, campers, for picnics, for 
excursions on land or on sea. The best of all wafers for chafing dish cookery. 

The "Vital Question Cook Book" is sent free for the asking.

Women Ws^e-eamers 

Most of the ills, real ao<l imaginary, 
with which society k afflicted, have 
been, at one time or another, laid at 
the door of the woman wage-earner. 
Race suicide, the decreasing marriage 
rate, the increasing divorce rate, wife 
desertion, undermined domesticity, even 
the disappearance of the cook, have 
been, among other calamities, ascribed 
to the iniquitous tendency of the modem 
woman toward financial independence 
out^de the home. It is a simple matter 
to make such charges, and under present 
circumstances impossible either to prove 
or disprove them. We have practically 
no data to indicate the effect, social or 
other, which has followed the entrance 
of women into industrialism. 

That important changes have oc- 
curred since women took to working for 
wages instead of their board, no one 
can doubt. It remains to be proved 
that society has suffered. No one but a 
theorizing sentimentaUst ever main- 
tained that women at any period con- 
stituted an idle class. They have, in 
fact, always worked. The share of 
women in the world's toil has probably 
not increased, and there is reason to 
doubt if it has changed radically in 
character. 

!□ a recent number of the Journal 
of Political Economy, two University of 
Chicago women pubHsh a r^um4 of 
that part of the report of the twelfth 
census which deals with women en- 
gaged in gainful occupations. From 
these statistics it appears that more 
than five million women were earning 
money in 1900, and that the rate of in- 
crease, for the decade, of wage-earning 
women was much greater than the cor- 
responding rate for the employment of 
men. The number of women in in- 
dustry actually increased faster than 
the female population. The gain was 
not confined to the East, where im- 
migration might be supposed to have 
caused it, but was marked in all sec- 
tions of the country. The census

scheduled 303 occupations, and women 
appeared in 295 of them. The only 
occupations in which they are not found 
are the United States army and navy, 
the fire departments, and "helpers to 
roofers, slaters, steam boiler- makers, 
and brass workers. ' ' In almost all 
occupations women are increasing. In 
only four important cccupaticns are 
they decreasing, and it is interesting to 
find that the occupations which are be- 
coming unpopular with women are cf a 
character usually described as feminine, 
— dressmakers, seamstresses, servants, 
and waitresses. Women dressmakers 
increased only 17.8 per cent, between 
1890 and 1900; men dressmakers in- 
creased 1 50 per cent. Women milliners 
increased 40.5 percent.; men milliners, 
340 per cent. Men appear also to be 
crowding women out of the saloon 
business, the laundries, the tailor shops, 
and, to a certain extent, the cotton 
milb. But women increased in all 
departments of trade and transportation 
120.3 to men's 37.6 per cent. Women 
distanced men in all but one of the five 
large groups of the census classification. 
The exceptional group was that of do- 
mestic and personal service. 

The census does not give any real 
information as to the competition be- 
tween men and women in trades and 
professions, One is left to infer that 
men and women are performing sub- 
stantially the same tasks, but even su~ 
perficial observation of the facts dis- 
proves this hypothesis. We really do 
not know just how far, if at all, women 
have displaced men in industry; neither 
do we know exactly the extent of direct 
competition between the sexes. The 
subject is of great importance. The 
study published in the Journal of Po- 
litical Economy rightly points out tliat 
"with it is inextricably interwoven the 
vital question of the nature of the work 
to be done by women, the dignity and 
permanence of their position in the 
industrial world, and the effect upon 
them of the work they do." — New York 
Nation.

Malnutrition Cause of Crime 

A simple method of' abolishing vic« 
and crime in large cities is announced 
by Professor Alexander Haig, the dis- 
tinguished English physiologist and 
physician to the Metropohtan HospitaJ 
in London. The cntninal classes, ac- 
cording to him, are recruited from the 
pauper classes, who, after they "lose 
heart," become unemployable, and de- 
generate into chronic loafers, beggars, 
and thieves. Writing to the Medical 
Record of New York on the subject, Dr. 
Haig says : — 

"I beUeve that, when these people 
lose heart, it means that the heart 
muscle is at last sharing with the 
other muscles in the general malnu- 
trition. As the result of this, the heart 
is, perhaps, never again able to keep up 
the same blxid pressure to produce 
the same muscular nutrition, and the 
fonner strength of muscle and nerve, 
or of will power. 

"No doubt, if such a person were 
carefully dieted and rested for months, 
that person would return to a normal 
or approximately normal condition. 
These poor people, however, practically 
never have this chance." 

Professor Haig says it is the duty of 
physiologists to point out to the govern- 
ment the danger of underied classes of 
the population. 



It described his Cheese 

The girl asked the pohte salesman if 
he had good cheese. 

"We have some lovely cheese," was 
the smiling answer. 

"You should not say 'lovely cheese,'" 
she corrected. 

"Why not? It is," he declared. 

' ' Because ' ' — with boarding-school 
dignity — ' * 'lovely ' should be used 
to quahfy only something that is alive." 

"Well," he retorted, "I'll stick to 
'lovely.' " — New York Press.

Lemon Syrup from the Kruit 

To make a rich lemon syrup, select 
eight or ten bright yellow, ripe, juicy 
lemons, and grate off the yellow part 
into a large mortar. Cover the grat- 
ing with about a half-pound of granu- 
lated sugar, and with the pestle rub 
thoroughly together. 

If the mixture is allowed to stand for 
three or four hours, the result is better. 

When ready to finish, cut the lemons 
and extract the juice. Add the juice 
to the grated rind and sugar, and stir 
until it is all, or nearly all, dissolved. 

Now take a one-gallon bottle, and 
with a funnel and piece of cheese-cloth 
strain the liquid into the bottle, agitat- 
ing with a spoon until all the syrup has 
passed through. Pour over the residue 
about eight ounces of boiling hot water. 
This will carry through any surplus 
of sugar, and will soften the rind, which 
should now be thoroughly squeezed, 
to extract the oil and yellow color 
as much as possible. Add a good 
heavy syrup (sugar and water boiled 
together) to nearly fill the bottle, and 
shake up thoroughly. 

No coloring, acid, or foam extract 
should be added. This syrup should be 
used up inside of two days, if possible, 
and it is better to make it every day. 
It can be used in a number of ways, and 
will go quickly. Use in sweetening 
yoiu" lemonades, and see how it will im- 
prove their flavor. — Dr-uggisW Circular.

Against Sarah's Rules 

That Philadelphia conservatism is not 
confined to the "upper classes" is in- 
stanced by the experience of a woman 
from a Western city, who recently came 
to live in Philadelphia. She hired for a 
cook a middle-aged negress: 

One afternoon Mrs. B. went into her 
kitchen, and said: "Sarah, I neglected 
to provide anything in the way of meat 
for tea to-night, but we will have some 
waffles. We are all so fond of them." 
The cook said nothing. 

When the bell rang for tea, the family

tion of any waffles. Mrs. B. sent for 
the cook. 

"Sarah, where are our wafHes?" 

Sarah drew herself up. In a voice 
that trembled with outraged dignity 
she repUed : — 

"Mis' B., I'se done cooked in de first- 
est fam'Ues of Philadelphia for mo' dan 
thirty yeahs, an' I nebber knowed any 
of 'em to hab waffles for tea Sunday 
night. You cain't hab no waffles I " 

And they did not.— Phiiadelphia

A simple and effective way to 
remove fruit or vegetable stains from 
the hands is to use raw tomato. 
When in season, it is much cheaper 
than lemon, and answers the same 
purpose. L.

What is the most impure article 
of /00^ consumed in your home? 

Think before you answer — 

It is one of the necessities of life 
—used by every member of your 
family at every meal — on nearly 
everything eaten — onrf it enters 
into every part of your body. 

That's whyyour health demands 
absolute purity in this article of 
food above all others — 

And yet it is, without donbt, the 
most impure — and thereioro the 
must dangerous — food that you 
taX~i{ you buy the ordinary kind. 

Of couise — it's salt — just plain, 
every-day salt. 

If yon use any salt, except that 
made by our exclusive process, 
you eat disease.

Wben salt has passed throngta oar 
nnique process, it is over 99 per cent 
pure salt. 

Analysis proves that Shaker Salt 
is free of gypsum — tree of all the 
dangerous impurities found In all 

Satt packed in bo^s cannot help 
but become contaminated, because 
salt absorbs impurities almost as 
readily as butter and milk. 

Bag-salt lies- on the grocers' floor 
or shelves—becomes sticky and 
lumpy — becomes tainted with all 
sorts of dirt, odors, impurities and 
disease germs. 

Shaker Salt comes toyouimmacu 
late in its cleanliness and purity. 

Because our carton is made of 
paraffin-coated pure wood flbre — the 
only air-tight, moisture-proof, odor- 
proof, ^erm-proof packai;:e — it iceeps

Rinse the bottles with cold water, wash them inside and out In the

Autumn Days 

By Kate Matson Post 



The summer had been so glad and gay, The squirrels are busy in the trees, 
It had gone at a headlong pace, And the blue jay calls loud and clear, 

Dame Nature adding new charms each day They feast as they gather in their stores, 
To her wild bewitching grace. They know the winter is near. 

We fancied that, when the autumn came, The chestnut burrs hang heavy with nuts, 
The days would be dreary and long. And the coons grow fat on the corn, 

But the rustling wind 'mongst yellow leaves And one is acting a foolish part 
Is sweet as the wild bird's song. The wild folk's wisdom to scorn.

The Public Schools of To-day 

By Mary H. Northend 

TO one not in touch with the the finished product of the high school 

methods of the modem pub- everything tends to an all-round de-

lady if he had mastered "his alphabet," 
fixed an utterly uncomprehending eye 
upon her, looking as nearly blank as it 
is possible for an up-to-date kinder- 
garten child to look. 

Instead of the alphabet, which was 
considered the first proper mental food 
for young children in those dim and 
unenlightened days of which we ourselves 
are a product, one's first taste of educa- 
tion in these days, may we say, is a 
lesson inspiring patriotism by the fol- 
lowing game. The children are formed 
into two Hnes, a "street," while a 
company of children, waving flags and 
led by a captain, march impressively 
down the "street" to inspiring music 
and the cheers of an excited populace. 
Or one's first impressions may be along 
some other line of thought, similarly 
developed. 

The morning talks by the teacher 
on pertinent subjects keep these chil- 



dren informed on subjects of which their 
parents, in some cases, have ideas 
decidedly misty. 

Art, too, has its place in these early 
years. Drawing from life models, the 
model generally being one of the chil- 
dren, is popular. The results in almost 
all instances, while naturally crude, 
show clearly the thought conveyed by 
the pose of the child-model. 

In many schools, sewing is taught 
as one of the regular studies. Beauti- 
ful specimens of embroidery and drawn- 
work are exhibited as the work of the 
children. 

In the tenement districts the teach- 
ing of these branches enables the child, 
even at a tender age, to do much toward 
helping the overworked and often 
ignorant mother to clothe decently a. 
large family. 

The proper cooking of food is also 
taught, and is of inestimable value, par-

ticularly in these same tenement dis- 
tricts. 

The proper ventilation of a room, 
with the care and making of a bed, 
and, in some cases, simple lessons in 
nursing, are doing much to bring 
before parents as well as children 
the necessary laws of health and hy- 
giene. 

Physical culture is taught almost 
from the time the pupil enters school, 
with simple exercises at first up to the 
well-equipped high-school gymnasium, 
from which the pupil, if he has made 
the most of his opportunities, may 
emerge erect, with good red blood 
coursing through his veins. 

For the girl the introduction of 
basket-ball teams has done much, 
giving her a taste for the more ener- 
getic and stimulating exercises of her 
brother. These, with the ball teams 
for the boys, do much in the inter- 



scholastic games to promote loyalty to 
and pride in one's own school. 

Gardening, too, has been introduced 
even into some city schools, where small 
tracts of unused land are being tilled 
by the children. Each child is given 
a small plot on which he may raise his 
own particular choice of crop. 

Manual training is exceedingly pop- 
ular, not only with the boys, but with 
the girls; and it is no unusual sight 
to see a girl, enveloped in a pinafore, 
working at the carpenter's bench. 
Small articles, such as picture frames, 
stools, tabourets, etc., and even articles 
of furniture, beautifully and sohdly 
made, are turned out hy these same 
girls. In some cases such taste and 
skill have been acquired in this work 
that it has been continued after the 
pupil's graduation, one girl making her- 
self an entire set of bedroom furnititfe. 

By the time one has completed a

high-school course he has accom- 
plished much'in the way of art. He Is 
able to draw creditably from the cast, 
and can do color work from the natural 
flower, besides designing wall papers, 
book covers, and other useful objects. 

Pyrography has also become popular, 
the pupil making his own designs for 
burning. Work in wood, copper, and 
brass, the latter being hammered into 
dishes, buckles, and brooches, burnt 
and tooled leather, are some of the 
things included in the study of the arts 
and crafts. 

Music, too, has its place. Songs 
are taught the pupil at the outset of 
his school career. Bv the time the 
pupil leaves the grammar school he 
is able to sing creditably intricate 
part songs, with a knowledge of the 
theory of music. Really difficult music 
is undertaken in the high school. In 
some instances entire oratorios are 
given by he pupils. Many schools 



maintain their own orchestra, some of 
them numbering twenty or more pieces. 
The instruments are played by the 
pupils, who lead in the marching. In 
some cases, concerts have been given, 
netting respectable sums for the school. 
Occasionally in the lowest grades the 
pupils are allowed to bring from home 
their toy trumpets, drums, clappers, 
and other instruments, and form an 
orchestra, led by one of their number. 
This develops a sense of rhythm, if not 
of harmony. Fortunately, at that age 
one's lungs are not robust. 

One may graduate from a high 
school fully equipped to enter the 
business world. Typewriting and 
stenography are thoroughly taught, 
so that a course in these branches at 
a business college is no longer neces- 
sary, A well-equipped bank is main- 
tained in some schools, where by actual 
experience the pupil learns all that is 
to handle properly and care

for such property as he may later 
acquire. 

The teaching of good citizenship is 
taking its place in our schools. 

A proposition of much benefit to the 
schools of a certain city was defeated 
by the ignorant element of the city's 
voters, bringing before the people the 
need of more intelligent citizenship. 
Out of this grew what is known as the 
"School City," an organization of the 



pupils into a city form of government. 
Elections are held, at which the citi- 
zens elect their mayor, judge, and other 
officers, the citizens being responsible 
for good order. 

While the pupil is keeping up the 
ordinary branches of study, he is able 
to bring to the acquisition of these 
"hard facts" a mind broadened and 
stimulated by his work along the lines 
mentioned. 



The "What-if" 

By Jessie Juliet Knox 



The big " What-ip" is a giant bold. 
At hb name man trembles and cowers; 

Just now he dwells in the land o( gold, 
Id the wonderful land of flowers. 



When the darluiess falls, and you go to bed, 
And the goddess Sleep would woo. 

He comes, and malies you cover your head, 
And you shiver through and through. 



'Tis all very well when the sun is out. 

And the sky above is blue. 
But, when night comes, then the fiend will 

What-if ?—0-oo! O-oo! 

What-if another quake should come, What-if another (ire should start. 

And shake you out of your bed. And another Terror arrive * 

And ihe walls should fall out, and the chimney What if a famine should happen n 

fall in, We should none of us survive. 
Right on your poor little head } 

What-if the tourists should cease to pour in 
To our land of flowers and prunes? 

What-if the year should stay always March, 
With never any Junes? 



What-if the Golden Gate should sink. 
And a tidal wave should come, 

And we should all be swept away? 
Why, that would be "going some." 

What-if the earth should open up. 
And swallow you right now, 

Leaving your body half in and half out 
'Twould be bad, you must allow. 



And so the Californians say 
They will slay this giant bold. 

They will thrust him bodily out from 
■flieir beautiful land of gold. 

And we will live without a fear. 
On our shining, sea-girt cliffs 

And in our fields of poppied gold, 
Nor heed his old " WH-\T-tPS,"

When Maria Got Even 

By Alix Thorn 



MRS. LOSY, in the act of 
spreading the pink fly netting 
over the dining-table, paused 
when the rattle of wheels sounded in 
front of the house. She hurried to the 
window, peered curiously out through 
the closed blinds, and saw the stage 
passing on its way to the Junction, foiu* 
miles below. Her practised eye dis- 
covered two passengers, an elderly 
woman and an attenuated younger one. 

"I'll bet a cooky," she said to herself, 
"that they come from Maria Brill's. 
The stage took 'em past here but three 
days ago. Don't I wish the girls 
wan't both gone and the men all hayin' ! 
I do declare, I ache to talk to some one. 
Oh, Maria Brill, she's enough for any- 
body!" And Mrs. Losy chuckled as 
she drew the calico-covered rocker to 
the open door, and began to shell peas 
for supper. 

This peaceful occupation was in- 
terrupted an hour later by the arrival 
of a neighbor, who, with reticule on her 
arm and stm-bonnet on her head, an- 
nounced that she had come to spend 
the rest of the afternoon, "that is, pro- 
vidin' you'll keep me to supper, Sarah 
Ann Losy," she said. "My folks is 
all to the furnace to-day, gettin' the 
horses shod, and, fer's I know, they 
won't get back till evenin'." 

"Well, if you ain't welcome this day, 
you wasn't never," cried her hostess, 
eagerly. "My folks is off, too, at the 
far meadow. They calkilated not to be 
done till late. But, O Permilla Hinsdale, 
the stage passed here about twelve, — 
two wimmin in it, — I surmised they had 
come from Maria Brill's, and" — 

"They did," broke in her guest, un- 
tying the strings of her bonnet, and de- 
positing the bonnet upon the safe. 
"I knew the whole story from Zilpha 
Ham, who's been doin' sewin' at 
Maria's. 'Taiu't any breach of confi- 



dence to tell it, for Zilpha, — she's 
sewed to two places since, — and, well, 
>'(m know Zilpha ! Oh, the life of adress- 
maker must be an interestin' one, 
Sarah Ann. Why, that woman could 
write a hull book. I don't know how 
many families she ain't sewed for, first 
and last." 

"Well, well!" cried Mrs. Losy, im- 
patiently, "I want you should tell me 
about Maria's company." 

Mrs. Hinsdale took out a ball of 
knitted lace from her reticule, put on 
her spectacles deliberately, and set to 
work before she commenced her nar- 
rative. "Of coiu'se, you know," she 
began, "that none of the connection 
liked it when Aunt Emmeline left the 
hull prop'ty to Maria Brill. They said 
that, as Maria wa'n't even a relative, 
only an adopted daughter, she shouldn't 
ought to have the hull, not the hull, 
but Aunt Emmeline — I can't think 
of her by any other name — ^had her 
opinion made up on most things." 

"True enough," responded Mrs. 
Losy. "EmmeUne Wanzer was set as 
the next one." 

"The will couldn't be broke, and the 
relations was just hoppin' mad," Mrs. 
Hinsdale continued. "Aunt Emme- 
line's nephew from Carmel, her half- 
sister's daughter and her children, her 
husband's niece, Mrs. Joe Peterson, 
all the Badgeleys, Munns, Cotterels, — 
in short, the hull lot of relatives, — felt 
most abused, and what they didn't say 
wasn't worth sayin'." 

"I can bet they was boilin', — I bet 
they was," chuckled Mrs. Losy. 

"Well, from what I can gather from 
Zilpha," murmured her caller, "for the 
last year Maria Brill's been overrun with 
company. Some of those heirs to her 
house' all the time, till, at last, she 
smelt a rat and made up her mind that 
they was livin' on her, tryin' to get

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



some good of the prop'ty. So, Zilpha, 
she suspicions Maria decided upon a 
plan. Aunt. Emmeline was most hos- 
pitable, and you know what a splen'd 
table she always set, — hams boiled 
so nicely, fowls cooked rich, hot bis- 
cuit, and grand cheese made on the 
place. After Emmeline's death, Maria, 
she seemed to wish to keep up the table, 
too; and, when Zilpha was sewin' 
motunin' for her, she says she never 
put teeth to better vittles in any house, 
and she don't never ast to. Havin* 
more money to use, Maria got more 
dressy-like, and, of coiffse, Zilpha, 
she's been there pretty steady, off. and 
on, and every time she went she found 
some of Aunt Emmeline 's relatives 
on hand, makin' themselves entirely 
at home. Then another thing, she 
noticed that the table began to fall 
off terrible. 'Most every day for dinner 
would come on a brisket piece, first 
warm, then a couple of days cold, — not 
even a meat pie made of it, — but few 
preserves and the plainest puddin's. 
Land sakes! She said there'd be rice 
puddin', Injun, sassage dumplin's, then 
rice puddin' agin. ' Some days 'twould 
be pork stew, and 'tis only real country- 
bred folks as likes pork stew. Zilpha 
said she almost choked, she was so 
full of laugh, to see Helen Winchell, 
when fried pork came on for breakfast 
one mornin' and pork stew was served 
up for dinner. Mrs. Winchell, she 
sat with her mouth screwed way up, 
and finally she says in a loud whisper 
to her oldest boy, 'You don't want 
so much pork: it's dreadful onhealthy.' 
And, good land! if the pair of them 
did not leave next afternoon. 

"The Carmel nephew next come for 
his visit. Great, fat, fleshy-lookin' 
man! You've seen him, Sarah Ann. 
Lawyer Bunce, he is." 

Mrs. Losy munched a pea medita- 
tively, and nodded. 

"Well, you should hear Zilpha tell 
it. He come, — Lawyer Bunce did, — 
and how his face fell when a brisket 



piece come on for dinner! She said 
she could tell his mouth had just been 
waterin' for a chicken dinner. His 
little ieyes looked reel angry, she re- 
ports, and he looks up at Maria to say, 
'Give up keepin' fowls, Maria?' *No,' 
answers Maria, cheerful-like. 'No, 
mine is doin' splendid. I've got up- 
wards of two hundred. I'll show 'em 
to you after dinner. Have more meat, 
do.' His stay was short. 

"Two of the Badgeleys come after 
him. They brought a tnmk and a 
telescope bag, — a nawful big one. Zil- 
pha see it, and they come drivin' up 
just before five. Maria, she give 'em 
for supper that evenin' bread and 
butter, canned pears, cold pork and 
potatoes, and pepper sauce to eat on 
'em, and reel plain sugar cookies. 
The young ones looked ready to cry. 
You see, they remembered the way they 
was fed up in Emmeline 's time, and 
none of the company seemed to relish 
what was set before 'em. Well, the 
table didn't improve none, and two 
days later, as the company was leavin', 
Zilpha, she heard Mrs. Badgeley say to 
Maria: 'Oh, things has changed here. 
I realize,' she says, 'that Aunt Em- 
meline's gone.' And Maria answers, 
'Have ye just realized?' 

"The last batch of company, — they 
left to-day, — 'twas them you see passin*. 
Zilpha went over to the house on some 
sort of pretext, and got there just as 
the two were drivin' out of the yard 
about eleven. 

"And, now, what do you think? 
Maria, she fairly made Zilpha stay to 
dinner with her, and Zilpha said she 
would say that she never et a finer meal 
in that house, — not even in Emmeline's 
day. 'Twas a chicken dinner with all 
the fixin's. The fresh apple pie was 
Maria's make, but the pickled plums, 
she said, was just Aunt Emmeline all 
over again. I met Zilpha by the 
school-house, as I was op my way here. 
She'd but just left Maria, and as we 
parted, she turnin' down the lane.

I could hear her sayin' to herself, 
'Oh, them pickled plums, them 
plums!'" 

"Well,. now, ain't Maria Brill a cute 
one !" exclaimed Mrs. Losy. **Oh, ain't 
she? And hearin' of such good things 



to eat reminds me I must be thinldn'

"That Ramshackle'' 

In Two Parts 
By Frances Campbell Sparhawk

T'S nothing short of an insult!" 
cried Jack Baring, angrily. **That 
ramshackle of a house out in the 
very comer of the world, and one hun- 
dred dollars to fix it up with ! " 

**But she was only yoiu* third cousin, 
wasn't she ? " pleaded his wife. ' *Really, 
Jack, she might easily have left you 
nothing at all." 

"Better that than what she has done. 
Ten acres of land and a house nobody 
can Uve in, to pay taxes on ! She was 
my third cousin, it is true. But she 
might have remembered the time that 
my father was a brother to her in need. 
One hundred dollars to put in order 
a place that you couldn't even let to 
anybody — ^yes, anybody — under a thou- 
sand for repairs!" 

"Is it really as bad as that?" ques- 
tioned his wife. 

"The best way is to have you see it for 
yourself. I'll take you down there next 
Saturday. And, if you don't fully 
agree with me, it's because you haven't 
eyes or" — 

"Or brains," put in Molly, with a 
laugh. "Better say it out. Jack! 
Make the best bid you can for my 
concurrence." 

The young husband joined in the 
young wife's amusement, looking at 
her with an affectionate pride that even 



his annoyance at her want of faith in 
his judgment could not subdue. "Well, 
then, it's settled we run down there 
Saturday?" he asked. 

"At least, it will be an outing," she 
retorted, as she restored his good humor 
by kissing him good-bye as he went to 
his office. 

The railway station nearest Jack's 
new inheritance was only thirty miles 
from the city where Mr. and Mrs. 
Baring lived, less than an hour by 
express train. But this advantage 
was more than offset by the fact that 
the house was three miles from the 
station, on the outskirts of a little 
town where the only trolley line ran 
in the wrong direction. In spite of 
this objection, however, the two had 
been planning to make this new pos- 
session their home, and Molly had even 
lain awake nights spending and re- 
spending in imagination the one hun- 
dred dollars which was all they could 
afford in fiu*niture. She must find 
out what would go farthest and look 
best. "How fine it is," she had said 
to her husband, **to be economical and 
fashionable at the same time ! I never 
imagined such a thing! But now we 
shall have our summer home, Uke our 
rich friends. It will be very simple, 
but we don't care for that. It will be 



126

antiquated, but that's the latest fad. 
We shall go there in the early spring 
and stay until late autumn, according 
to the dictates of Dame Grtmdy, — 
we may stay all winter at our own! — 
and we shall save ever so much money 
on it, even with your ticket to town; 
and I shall be 'delighted,' as my famous 
countryman SAys, to keep house. 
You've no idea of my abilities in that 
line." 

But all this had been before that run 
which Jack had taken to view his new 
property. Now the only way out he 
could find was to put it into an agent's 
hands and sell it at the first fair ofifer. 
He was not sanguine as to the amount 
it would bring. But Molly should 
take a view also, of course, if she wished. 

"I just can't give up those little 
downy chickens I've cuddled and 
counted over so many times," she said, 
"until with my own eyes I see them 
vanish round the last comer of my 
day-dream home." 

It was early May, with an east wind 
that only May can furnish in all its 
perfection, and that even the distance 
inland that the town lay could only 
partially subdue. The whole place 
looked at its worst as Molly stood 
shivering at the gateway, noting the 
tottering posts, the broken fences, 
the tangled lawn, the neglected or- 
chard, the dead branches on the ancient 
elms, the dilapidated bam, and, worst 
of aU, the great old house with bHnds 
awry and broken, with occasional 
shingles loose and dingy from lack of 
paint. 

"WeU," questioned Jack, as they 
stood .there, "are you satisfied? Or 
will you go further?" 

She was tempted to turn away, when, 
looking up, her eyes rested upon the 
soft and lovely tints of the trees sway- 
ing in the bitter wind, bidding their 
swelling buds to wait awhile, but with 
not an idea of deciding to give up the 
spring. "We'll go in," she said, hold- 



ing her head high, and treading the 
weed-grown path with a quick step. 

The chill of an empty house with the 
rain beating against Uie windows and 
the leaden sky showing every room still 
more gloomy were accidents that time 
and occupation would remedy. But 
the cracked, and in some rooms the 
broken, ceilings; the wall papers faded 
and torn, stained with more or less 
leakage in every room, showing that 
the roof needed shingling, if not more 
serious repairs; the bad condition of 
the floors; the broken spindles on the 
handsome stairway; the doors, a few 
in fair order, many with knobs or fasten- 
ings gone, and dragging on one hinge; 
the paint everywhere dingy or soiled, — 
all these were different. With firmly 
shut lips Molly walked from room to 
room, glancing about her with eyes 
that nothing escaped. At an upper 
front window she paused, and stood 
long looking out. "What a beautiful 
view, even now!" she said; "and how 
lovely it will be when the dead limbs 
and too heavy foliage are cleared away 
from those trees." 

" 'When,' Molly! Are you crazy?" 

"O Jack! A thousand dollars would 
make this place actually beautiful! 
The situation is fine, the views charm- 
ing. Look at this great hall down- 
stairs, running through the house with 
a door at each end, with old stone steps 
in the shape of a half -moon, the back 
door leading out into the garden. Open 
both doors in the summer, and we can 
look from the gate through the house 
to those hills off on the horizon." 

"Ah, yes, if we had the thousand!" 
said Jack, wishfully. "As it is, we 
couldn't make it habitable on a hun- 
dred, and we can't afford to keep it. 
You know how it is, Molly: my income 
is somewhat uncertain at present. I 
may earn more; but we must build 
upon only what I can be sure of, .you

certain stateliness, even in its worst 
estate. With people in it who know 
how to make a home, it will be attract- 
ive. I don't see now exactly how we 
can do it, but we simply have got to ; 
and, when one says that, things usually 
get done. But, my dear, we have 
two hundred dollars, for I have that 
nest egg of a htmdred, you know ! " 

"But that's for yourself. I don't 
want you to take that for my house, 
dear child." 

"Indeed!" cried Molly, backing oflF 
and looking at him quizzically ! " ' With 
all my worldly goods I thee endow,' 
isn't it ? I thought, now, this was my 
house, too," — 

"So it is, sweet; but" — 

"But you want to have all the priv- 
ilege of giving? Well, you can't do 
it this time. Jack. I could not invest 
that hundred better; and I'm going to 
use yours and mine, sir, as far as they 
will go on this house." 

"And then?" 

"And then come down here and Uve, 
and finish up as we go. I certainly 
am," she persisted. "You may stay 
in town and swelter all summer." 

"Do you want me to send down 
Collins to make an estimate?" he in- 
quired. 

"A swell architect!" she cried in dis- 
may. "Are you out of your senses. 
Jack? We'll drive back to the hotel 
and hunt up the best carpenter we can 
find here, and engage him to make 
an estimate. It's too late for that 
to-day. But I'll run down here Mon- 
day morning — or as soon as he can give 
me the time — and go over the place 
with him, and see what he sa3rs, and 
report to you." 

"Yes, my dear, see what he says, by 
all means. And you'll come back a 
sadder and a wiser woman." 

Molly was about to speak, but con- 
tented herself with smiling. The 
builder — ^the very best in town, the 
landlord assured them — ^was stun- 
moned, and Mrs. Baring engaged to 



meet him at the house the following 
Tuesday morning, go over the place 
with him, and get his estimate for 
repairs. He let fall one or two ap- 
preciative comments on the place which 
gave Molly the idea that he would 
prove the man she wanted. She be- 
lieved he would take an interest in the 
work. 

On the train going home, she said, 
"Now, Jack, to-night we must give 
notice to Mrs. Allen." 

"Notice of what?" 

"That we shall want board and rooms 
there only a week longer. Then we 
shall leave." 

"But we shan't." 

"Don't you see, my dear, we must 
be on the spot when the repairs are 
making. We shall save time and 
money, and things will be better done." 

"What repairs?" 

"Why, the repairs on the house, of 
course." 

"Now, Molly, I'm tired of this non- 
sense. I let you arrange for the esti- 
mate because I knew it would satisfy 
you. The thing can't be done." 

"We will move into the hpuse and 
stay there after the work has got on 
a little way," piu-sued Mrs. Baring 
impertiu-bably. "We shall save all 
our board money and Uve in the house." 

***Live'r' he cried, his face flushing 
with anger. *-You call it living T* 

"'Exist,' then; 'manage'; 'get on'; 
'hang on,' — anything you choose to 
call it, provided we stick. We'll give 
up our two rooms in town, and briug 
our furnitiure — ^all we have — down 
here." 

"And set it round the house while 
the plastering is going on, I suppose. 
Your idea of economy!" 

Mrs. Baring looked at the speaker 
in silence, under her amusement a 
certain disdain which proved her 
strength of position and made him 
insist the more strongly that her 
whole plan was a chimera, as she would 
find out when the estimate came in.

"Meantime we will give the week's 
notice," she reiterated calmly. **I'll 
have the pictures crated, box what 
needs boxing, and be ready to come 
down here and pitch our tent some- 
where a week from Monday. Mean- 
while I'll find some place for shelter 
and storage tmtil we can get into a 
comer of your inheritance, to 'vege- 
tate' — ^since you object to calling it 
'live' — until the house is in order!" 

Her decision carried the day. That 
very nigjit notice was given, all the more 
readily that both wanted much to get 
into the country the coming summer. 
"We've burned our ships," said Baring, 
ruefully, as he looked about their 
pretty sitting-room, so soon to be dis- 
mantled. "We can't get rooms so good 
again for this price in this locality." 

"Yes, we've burned our ships," re- 
turned Molly. "It's the only way. 
Now we'll stay there because we 
must. Hobson's choice is often a 
good one." 

Monday Molly was very busy, al- 
though she obeyed her husband's in- 
junctions not to disturb anything in the 
rooms until she had learned the cost 
of repairing the "ramshackle." 

Tuesday was a perfect day; and the 
place of her affections looked to her 
most inviting, in spite of its dilapida- 
tion. In her mind's eye it was already 
beautiful. She walked through the 
rooms with a charming air of pro- 
prietorship, glancing with satisfaction 
at the tall builder at her side, and re- 
membering Jack's comment on his 
hair, "as red as a Norseman's, and 



his face honest and alert." Molly's 
companion evidently knew his business, 
and had taste as well as judgment. 
She would have been glad to make use 
of the latter; but she was emphatic 
in her assertions that only the work 
absolutely necessary was to be done, 
that the material used was to be the 
best of its kind, but that there was 
to be no fanciful or expensive wood- 
work or anything of the sort. 

Yet, between what she told the 
builder must be done and what he 
pointed out to her as absolutely need- 
ful, the length of the list sent her heart 
down into her boots, even before he 
had begun his ciphering. She waited, 
however, outwardly calm, until, after 
going over his figiu'es twice, and assur- 
ing her that he had made these the 
very lowest possible, he said: "Hard 
pine floors downstairs, spruce upstairs, 
the few new windows we've agreed 
upon, new glass where needed in the 
others, ceilings plastered and plaster 
elsewhere mended wherever required, 
doors hung and put in order, painting 
and papering, shingling the house, 
building a hen-yard, and putting things 
into order generally, — ^no fancy, I un- 
derstand, Mrs. Baring. Now the very 
lowest I can undertake the job for — 
and then I'm dead stu'e to lose on it — 
is five hundred dollars. That shuts 
off lots of things that would be handy 
and look fine ; and it leaves the barn out 
of the count. It's dirt cheap, Mrs. 
Baring." 

Yes. But as far above Molly as if it 
had been five thousand.

Table Manners 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



THE evasive art and indefina- 
ble charm of good table man- 
ners is allm'ing. To be real 
hmigry and yet eat with grace ; to care 
not a whit about any special food, but 
to be hospitably inclined towards all 
kinds; or to have no appetite .and 
yet to be fastidious about what is set 
before one, — ^are table habits that offer 
scope for the practice of good mannas. 
We may be tired of the story of the 
spotted sprats, with its appended 
moral of the poUte lie, which entailed 
the constant repetition of the dish, or 
we may covet for our household that 
economical division of taste between 
Jack Sprat and his wife, by which 
nothing was ever left over, yet all 
the same most of us neither know how 
to decline a dish as if we were sorry 
to do so nor how to divide our sepa- 
rate fancies between the viands offered, 
that all shall be constuned. 

It is not modes of serving with which 
we are now concerned, but how to adapt 
ourselves to any mode and not give 
offence. Alas! it is no longer good 
form to pour one's tea from the cup 
into its saucer, and slowly drink it 
hot with deep breathing of delight. 
Small saucers, once called cup-plates, 
have ceased to constitute part of any 
breakfast set. A hot cup of tea, 
poured right from a brown earthen 
teapot, set on the kitchen range and 
then into a saucer, is still associated 
to me with the making up of the week's 
accounts late on Saturday nights before 
the Stmday sermons were begun by 
my father. Nowhere but in the 
kitchen, at a little table drawn close 
to the fire, would he drink that tea. 
For those were still the days of family 
simplicity. They are gone, with the 
Fast Day Indian whey pudding (which 
took as long to bake as were the Sun- 
day morning services) and with honest 



deUght in just eating. Now we nibble 
unless we Fletcherize. It is as well 
to acknowledge at once that it is not 
graceful to be a hearty eater, and also 
that it is inconveniently expensive. 
A guest who does not take to cereals 
and Uver, but must have fruit, eggs, 
and sirloin roasts, makes a big differ- 
ence in family reckonings. 

But how to eat, how to sit, how to 
handle knife, fork, and spoon, how to 
use the finger-bowl, how to take one's 
soup without noise, how not to drink 
and eat at the same second, how to 
adjust the napkin,— all these triviaUties, 
neither neglected nor pimctihously ob- 
served, enter into good manners, with 
due regard to the truth, not generally 
conceded, that there are several right 
ways of doing the same thing. It is 
cruel to throw a napkin carelessly on 
the table at the end of a meal, if there 
is only one maid of all work in the fam- 
ily or if it is the hostess herself who 
irons the napkins. It would be rude 
to fold it up, if the butler is roimd. 
But, if the careful host has it pinned 
round his neck, such prerogative should 
be the privilege of age alone, not of 
company. The same latitude exists 
with the finger-bowl. Don't use it as 
vigorously as would a canary bird 
taking his bath. Don't ignore it as if 
it were a futile refinement of cleanUness. 
The taking of soup, that is the hard 
thing to do — just right. Practise by 
one's self till the noiseless art is 
gained. 

Good manners begin at breakfast 
with the eating of oranges, grow better 
at lunch with the informaUty of the 
repast, and are best at dinner, with 
its code of etiquette, family or cere- 
monial. Shall one wait till all are 
served before beginning to eat? If 
so, what shall one do when he has 
finished, and others are on the way to 



I30

the close? If there are children to 
hurry off to school, there is no leisure 
for extra good manners, for the pre- 
emptions of youth ^ and business are 
always butting up against formal cour- 
tesies. PimctuaHty is the only in- 
variable polite necessity. If each 
grown-up person would have break- 
fast by herself, how much more agree- 
able she would be the rest of the day! 
It is a severe strain on limited strength 
or ability to be amiable at breakfast, 
though it is the way to find out what 
kind of wives and husbands men and 
women will make. But, oh ! the luxury 
of breakfasting by one's self, in negli- 
gee, with coffee, toast, and newspaper 
or book; to lounge or sit square at the 
table or to jump up and look out of the 
window; to sip a Httle, to read a few 
lines, to take large or small mouthfuls, 
and then sip a little more ; to be slovenly, 
lazy, unguarded ; to have neither maid 
nor man around; to be just by one's 
own cross, sleepy, tired, fussy, or 
energetic self for twenty minutes in a 
busy day, and then to push back 
chair and plate, refreshed and ready 
for work, — oh, it is great! Give me 
just one such half-hour, and I'll delve 
all the test of the day. Just because 
such a breakfast is not a good instance 
of table manners, is it such a boon to 
one jaded with the decorousness of 
neatness. Yet all such "relaxing" 
braces one up for the ** togetherness" 
of lunch and the formalism of dinner. 

After all is said, the good table 
manners of convention and of char- 
acter are not so far apart as they at 
first seem. To the woman who does 
her own work — that is, for the family 
and herself — many of the trappings of 
good table manners would be positive 
injuries. Not for her relays of plates, 
finger-bowls, doilies, etc., nor table- 
cloths, if white enamel cloth can be 
had. Yet the tired mother of a large 
family does not think her whole duty 
is done unless she has a damask cloth, 
coarse though it may be, to wash and 



iron. Nor does a man realize how long 
it takes to wash dishes. But all the 
same the art of eating slowly, neatly, 
and noiselessly can be acquired in a 
small tenement as well as in a luxurious 
house, wherever one thinks it worth 
while to be well bred, if just with one's 
mere family or one's lonesome self. 

Clubs, restaurants, lunch coimters, 
often afford good examples of how not 
to do. Still, it is safe to say that there 
is as much of the essentials of good man- 
ners down town as there is up town, in 
eating. Haste in eating sometimes 
contrasts well with leisure in taking 
one's time at table, — an exasperating 
habit to a housekeeper. If encourag- 
ing, it is also pathetic to see how 
prevalent have become the modem 
equipments of a table, differing only 
in values of cost and taste, from the 
solid silver salt and pepper set to the 
pressed blue glass shakers. It was 
a restaurant keeper who out of the 
bitterness of his heart complained that 
the genial humorist, William D. How- 
ells, need not have written that a fly 
was in the sandwich bought at a cer- 
tain Maine depot, as flies were every- 
where and his tables were set in pretty 
homelike fashion. 

Along with the art of graceful neat- 
ness at table goes knack in conversa- 
tion, as the second essential in good 
manners. Treasure up harmless bits 
of gossip and good anecdotes for 
dinner. Don't be beguiled into argu- 
ments until cigars are lit. Don't find 
fault at meal-times with children, hus- 
band, friends, or even with the world 
in general, but also don't be aggravat- 
ingly meek, non-committal, and gen- 
eralizing in talk. Be funny, for even 
patient affection grows fatigued in try- 
ing to appear pleased with what is 
said when one isn't, the effort making 
the poor meat seem stringier than ever. 
There are, however, many persons who 
apparently think that all they have to 
do to entertain others is to be brilliant 
themselves instead of seeing that what 



Two Ways with the Simple Life 



13^ 



is wanted is the skill to make others 
realize that they are appearing delight- 
ftil and amusing. 

That good table manners are more 
and more in vogue is in keeping with 
the habit of imitation and with pros- 



perous conditions. The real fear is 
that it will be thought that such 
manners are accessible only to wealth, 
instead of remembering that refine- 
ment in eating can go along with making 
things easy for the women folk. 



The Sky^s a Garden 

By Grace Stone Field 



The sky's a garden, orderly and fair; 
The stars are jasmine clusters, crowding there. 
Its clouds are beds of violets, pure and white, 
Misty with dew, dream-perfumed with de- 

Ught. 
And in its borders, when the night has gone. 
Flower the glowing roses of the dawn. 



O garden of the sky, so still and far I 
Beyond the storms of earth your blossoms are. 
Perhaps the angels walk adown your ways, 
Through all the sweetness of untroubled days, 
And, smiling, watch to see, when night haF 

gone, 
The slow unfolding, radiant rose of dawn I 



Two Ways with the Simple Life

O," said the city man, 
planted luxmiously in a bed 
of pine needles under a pine 
whose wide-spread branches could eas- 
ily shelter a hundred. '*No. This is 
good! The choicest bit, perhaps, of 
an unsurpassed vacation. But pray 
let us have a few minutes' silence as to 
the simple life. 'Back to the land!' is 
a pleasing cry; but how about the 
thousands of us who must live where 
our work is, and make that living tol- 
erable? Even the fiuy of fervor in 
your head-man here doesn't convince 
me that cathedrals are to be abolished 
because columnar tree-trunks are as 
good or better, or that a tent is the only 
ideal habitation for that part of the 
world really in earnest. There's more 
than one way with the simple life. 
Meditate on Marcus Aurelius: 'Even in 
a palace life can be hved well/ other- 
wise simply. Meditate on my wife. 



She's got it all down to a fine point. 
Tell them, Connie." 

The charming young woman, whose 
cheeks flushed crimson as the group 
repeated in unison, "Yes, tell us," 
shook her head. 

"I have told it so often, John, that 
you know it by heart. This time it is 
your turn, and I'll prompt if you miss 
anything." 

"But why do you have to live in the 
city ? " interrupted the objector. There 
is always an objector in every vacation 
party. 

* ' Because," returned the first speaker, 
"I am not going to live the bloodless 
life. I like to stay with the crowd. 
Why should I go off into a pleasant 
comer and pat my own back because 
I have found it, and sit hugging the 
illusion to my heart and conscience 
that that is enough? Service for all, 
justice for all, — ^that is enough. Nothing

less will suffice. And so, though we 
take to the woods for our summer 
vacation, two college professors as we 
are, needing it as rest from one year's 
work and foundation for another, we 
are both of one mind as to how to 
handle the other nine months. Tell 
them, Connie. I always get a new point 
of view when you do. If I were going 
to lecture on it formally, I should call 
it, perhaps, *The Abolition of White.' 
Most of these tent-folk here seem to be 
in white. How do they do it ? " 

**You wander shamefully," said the 
wife. **Go on." And now the young 
professor sat up and looked about 
him. 

**In the first place," said he, "we 
talked it over for two years, the time 
of our engagement, and my wife experi- 
mented steadily. It wasn't a question 
of abolishing everything desirable and 
calling it the simple life. It was the 
holding on to what people of true taste 
and cultivation found essential. She 
had been a teacher of manual training 
in another city, and resigned her place 
to come to me. She was certain it 
would be possible to keep house, yet 
not be swamped by the work it entails. 
She wanted a post-graduate course in 
her chosen work, and we both wanted 
beautiful things, suited not only to the 
tastes, but the actual needs of both. 
She was to study the higher art phases 
of manual training; and, as she was re- 
quired to produce some forms herself, 
she made things that would be what 
we needed in our own home, a quiet 
flat up in Morningside. Everything 
was made of solid oak, from typewriter 
desk for me to dining-table, the spaces 
for them in each room carefully meas- 
ured. She began with a hand-made 
oak chair, the wood for it two dollars 
only, but we could not have bought it 
for fifteen. On her own writing-desk 
she put in a morning study period of 
six weeks, about fifty hours of labor, 
but every drawer and pigeon-hole ex- 
actly as she desired. Then she made 



a sumptuous-looking box, a wedding 
chest like those of the old time, which 
makes a fine window-seat and holds 
all manner of things. And the dining- 
table was finished with boiled oil in- 
stead of varnish and shellac, coat 
after coat rubbed in patiently, till now 
nothing hiuts it, and every guest ad- 
mires its beauty. A list was made 
beforehand of just absolute needs, 
and the house has not one thing that 
does not come under that head. There 
is no silver to keep clean save knives, 
forks, and spoons. There is no big 
sideboard, but a small oak serving 
table made by herself, with spaces 
cunningly planned for holding just 
the things most used on the table. 
For a good while she kept a list of the 
time required to do each individual 
thing, and, if even five minutes could 
be saved by elimination or some new 
way of dmng it more easily, studied 
it out till the thing was accomplished. 
She had given up her salary as teacher, 
and wished to spend as little as pos- 
sible till earning began again. Her 
post-graduate course is over, and she 
has been a year professor, has made 
much of the furniture of the house with 
her own hands, kept house without a 
maid, and made all her own clothes. 

*'We eat no meat. That makes a big 
difference in cooking and in gas bills. 
The vegetables that need long time for 
cooking are all eliminated. Potatoes 
are troublesome to prepare, dnd we 
substitute rice mostly. If Europeans 
get on comfortably on a uniform break- 
fast, why shouldn't we? Variety can 
come in the other meals. We use let- 
tuce profusely, for it is to be had good 
the year round in New York, and have 
an endless variety of salads, always at 
dinner, cutting into the lettuce fruit 
or vegetable, whatever is in season, 
and using much of the best olive oil. 
Bananas and tomatoes are our stand-by, 
and apples baked, stewed, or raw. 
Eggs, too, we use in every form except 
fried. The best bread to be bought, and 



A Witch Party

often quick muffins of wheat and oat- 
meal. If you looked into otu* kitchen 
you would see just three cooking 
utensils hanging over the gas stove, 
a double-boiler, and two saucepans. 
They are enough. Om* only hot drink 
is cocoa. We have little puddings, if 
we want a sweet, or ice-cream, but no 
pies or cakes. No meat means saving 
lots of expense, and knocks out grease 
and smells and much dish-washing. 
The dishes are never wiped. After 
washing they are rinsed in boiling 
water, and left to drain till they are 
wanted. Nothing white is used where 
it can be avoided, — I mean napkins, 
table-cloths, white curtains, and all 
the white fluffy things women mostly 
wear. A house with white bureau 
scarfs, bedspreads, and all the rest 
can't be kept presentable without con- 
stant work from somebody. So my 
wife uses soft silk blouses, and doesn't 
own a ruffled white petticoat. She 
makes aU her gowns in one piece, 
and I like 'em. So do other people. 
In short, we have every sort of com- 
fort a house stands for, with none of 
the usual fret and bother, and see no 
reason why many a family might not 
do the same. Perhaps they will some 



day when it dawns upon them what 
the simple life really stands for.- She'll 
tell the rest, if there is any rest, — 
washing put out and all that. But we 
live at ease and work happily, and 
our friends seem to like to come to 
us. What more would you have ? " 

'*We can't all make our own furni- 
ture," said the objector; *'and where's 
your outdoors ? " 

**We walk, my friend, going and re- 
turning from college, and daily, in 
good weather, use our bicycles in a 
spin up Riverside Drive or in the park. 
Also, we know the Jersey side, and all 
the big trees are our own up to Yonkers 
and beyond. That appears to be a 
fair portion of outdoors. As to furni- 
ture, there are good simple shapes to 
be had. The chief word, as you have 
seen, is 'elimination.' A whirlwind 
of useless and mostlv unbeautiful brie- 
k-brac is in every home. Abolish it 
all, and Freedom begins." 

"But," began the objector. 

** *But me no buts,' " said the pro- 
fessor, rising hastily. **Work it out, 
man, as we all must, each according 
to his light; and with illumination you'll 
find elimination the way out into 
peace." 



A Witch Party 

For Hallowe'en 

By Helen Bertha Crane 



USE no lights but candles and 
Jack-o'-lanterns, and, as the 
guests are welcomed in sub- 
dued whispers, usher them into a room 
at one end of which hangs a large 
curtain or sheet with the words "The 
Witches' Spell." The letters should 
be At least ten inches high, cut from 
red paper or muslin, and basted on the 
sheet. At the proper moment the 



curtain, being withdrawn, discloses a 
large piece of brown paper bearing the 
following bewitched tale, which must 
be written large and clear with a paint 
brush, that all may see distinctly. 

When Sue was needing the dough, 
she let the bowl drop on her tough. 
It hurt her sough she never noticed 
that some of the dough fell on the 
fresh blew bough she had tide at her 



U4 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



waste. Tom had been too mough the 
meadough, hough the com, and fight 
the farmers' fough, the crough; but, 
when he returned, Sue was in such pane 
he had to gough at once, and rough 
down to Drugs & Cough, to get some- 
thing for her tough. She was soon 
relieved, though how the accident hap- 
pened she never did nough. 

The guests, having been provided 
with paper and pencils, are allowed 
ten or fifteen minutes to puzzle this 
out, which, when corrected, should read 
thus : — 

When Sue was kneading the dough, 
she let the bowl drop on her toe. It 
hurt her so she never noticed that 
some of the dough fell on the fresh 
blue bow she had tied at her waist. 
Tom had been to mow the meadow, 
hoe the corn, and fight the farmers' 
foe, the crow; but, when he returned. 
Sue was in such pain he had to go at 
once, and row down to Drugs & Co. 
to get something for her toe. She was 
soon relieved, though how the accident 
happened she never did know. 

The prize for this should be the 
witch's ever present companion, a 
black cat, either one made of muslin 
stuffed with rags or a much smaller 
one filled with bonbons. 

Now will be the time to introduce 
some of the well-known but alwa3rs 
interesting Hallowe'en sports: bobbing 
for apples; feeling blindfolded for the 
three saucers, one being empty, the 
other two containing clear water and 
turbid water, meaning that one will 
remain single, marry, or marry a widow 
or widower according to which saucer 
is first touched; and, if an open fire 
is available, roasting chestnuts and 
melting lead to drop into cold water. 

A witch golf game is next started. 
Set at one end of the room a large paste- 
board box, the open side facing the 
company. At the other end of the 
room, as far from the box as possible, 
place in a row four apples, red, yel- 
low, green, and russet. Select four 



players. Provide them with children's 
brooms with which at a given signal 
each is to try to sweep his particular 
apple into the box. The first one to 
do so is the winner. After all the 
guests have tried their skill, let the 
winners of each group compete together. 
A suitable prize is an apple pincushion. 
A supper menu should be: — 

Witch Cap Croquettes. 

Broomstick Salad. 

Crescent-and-Full Moon Sandwiches. 

Bent Pin Pudding. 

Whipping-post Sauce. 

The croquettes are to be of chicken, 
shaped hke a witch's cap or an in- 
verted cornucopia. A mould for this 
may easily be made by taking a piece 
of stiff brown paper and roUing it into 
shape — three inches high and one 
inch across the opening — and sewing, 
to hold it firmly. If well greased on 
the inside, the croquette mixttu'e will 
easily slip out. Serve each croquette 
on a circular bit of cardboard one and 
one-half inches in diameter, which 
extending out will represent the rim 
of the hat. The salad is made from 
string beans, fresh or canned, but 
yellow ones are preferable. A little 
btmdle of these are tied together with 
a bit of heavy thread near the middle 
and at one end like a broom, a lead- 
pencil being first inserted in the upper 
end to serve for the broom-handle. 
The mayonnaise may be passed sep-

Perfume Therapeutics 

By Edwena Lawrence 



THE love of the ancients for 
flowers was due chiefly to their 
fragrance, as sweet odors were 
mostly appreciated in ancient and med- 
iaeval times. 

Egyptian women were lavish in their 
use of delicious perftmies and rare es- 
sences, bathing their hair and bodies 
in them, wearing scented bead neck- 
laces and also garlands of richly odor- 
ous flowers. Their guests were given 
chambers flower-strewn and fragrant 
with perfumes. 

Flowers, rare perfumes, and the in- 
cense of odoriferous gums formed part 
of the offerings to the gods, and were 
conspicuous in all entertainments. 
The incense-bearer was necessary at all 
religious ceremonies, and even the mum- 
mies were drenched with sweet odors 
and scented with spicy gums. 

All the civilized nations of antiquity 
exhibited this love of perfumes. The 
Greeks were famous for the ingenuity 
of the novel ways in which they intro- 
duced them into their entertainments. 
The Romans, also, became renowned 
perfumers. Arabia and India sup- 
plied great demands for essences and 
spices; and, indeed, the expenditures 



for this one luxury were most extrava- 
gant. 

Later receptacles and articles of dress 
were manufactured for the purpose of 
holding perfumes, such as the perfumed 
glove or shoe, the ring of surpassing 
workmanship, the pomanders, the jew- 
elled scent-box, and various sachets. 

The perfumes enjoyed were those 
most agreeable to the sense without 
any knowledge or consideration of their 
therapeutit effect. In these modem 
times, when science seizes otu* vagaries 
and makes them assume a more staple 
form, we realize that perfumes possess 
marked physiologic action. 

We know that herbous plants — the 
fragrant lavender, rosemary, and mign- 
onette — ftunish reviving odors and 
that their effect is soothing to the 
nerves, as are the odors of acacia, jas- 
mine, and lilacs to a healthy sense. 
The latter odors, in closer proximity 
or in larger quantities, have decidedly 
narcotic powers. The nervous will 
find the delicate fragrance of the cit- 
ron most tranquillizing. 

Musk acts as a tonic, while the odor 
of the orange flower has so depressing

THE PURE FOOD LAW 

WE are glad to note that the 
Hepburn Pure Food Bill 
has passed both houses of 
Congress and become the law of the 
land. Why this action was so long 
delayed is not easily accounted for. 
At last, however, our Congress seemed 
to realize that the people wanted some 
means of protection against the adul-. 
teration of food products and negligence 
in handling the same, and would hold 
somebody responsible for long-con- 
tinued inaction in a matter of such 
vital importance. Hence the statute. 
Manufacturers are apt to grow care- 
less and indifferent where health and 
sanitation involve labor and expense. 
This law provides the only reasonable 



assurance and^ means of redress against 
fraud and d^it in the manipulation 
of food products. Already the packing 
houses and canneries are compl3ning 
with the requirements of the law, and 
the entire process of packing and 
canning of foods is undergoing thorough 
renovation. The changes in surround- 
ings and the gain in cleanliness are 
marked indeed. In the long run this 
new regime in the greatest of all in- 
dustries is destined to prove the wis- 
dom of the old maxim. **Honestv is the 
best policy.'* On this point the editor 
of the Congregationalist and Christian 
World comments as follows: — 

"A good text for a sermon on the 
results of the investigations of the 
last few months into the business 
methods of some of the great enter- 
prises on whose service the people 
depend is Heb. xii. 1 1 : 'All chasten- 
ing seemeth for the present to be not 
joyous, but grievous; yet afterward 
it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them 
that have been exercised thereby, even 
the fruit of righteousness.' A great 
deal of regret was expressed that the 
exposure of the ways of the great pack- 
ing companies would diminish our 
trade with foreign cotmtries, and that 
the long discussion in Congress and the 
newspapers on railroad rebates and 
other practices now regarded as repre- 
hensible would lessen the value of 
railroad stocks and undermine confi- 
dence in business. Yet the peaceable 
fruit of righteousness is already ap- 
pearing, and is beyond what was ex- 
pected even by the most sanguine. 
Food products all over the world are 
more wholesome than they were, and in 
many cotmtries closer inspection has 
detected dangerous adulteration of 
meats and drinks, canned vegetables 
and drugs, and has stopped it. Prose- 
cutions are being pressed against repu- 
table German firms who have been 
found to employ chemists to use 
deleterious material for the manu- 
facture of food products, wines, medi- 



Editorials 



137 



cines, and perftimes, and it is said 
that few articles of this sort have es- 
caped adulteration by German manu- 
facturers. Human life is safer than it 
Has been for many years because of 
these investigations, and the trade in 
reliable food and drink products will 
increase as public confidence finds a 
just basis to rest on. Since the war 
against rebates began, the net earnings 
of raihoads in this country has steadily 
and largely increased, and it is agreed 
that this increase is in part due to the 
discontinuance of granting special priv- 
ileges in using railroads, which have 
been paid for by those not favored and 
in which the railroads themselves are 
the greatest losers. It is not the worthi- 
est argument that righteousness brings 
prosperity, but it is cheering to have 
evidence that those who seek first the 
kingdom of God and his righteousness 
have other things added." 

TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS 

THE majority of mankind, we 
are convinced, above all things 
else, are anxious to see truth 
and righteousness prevail. A wrong, 
an act of injustice, is nevfer condoned. 
Witness the case of Dreyfus in France. 
Gross injustice to an army officer, in- 
ferior in rank and uninteresting in 
character, has kept the entire state of 
France in a condition of feverish ex- 
citement and unrest for years, until 
at last the calumny has been refuted 
and justice meted out to the innocent. 
People everywhere hate injustice. The 
mission of the race is to overcome 
superstition and error, and live in ac- 
cordance with the laws of truth and 
righteousness. 

But the question often arises. What 
is truth ? We can only answer : Truth 
is not necessarily a belief. A belief may 
be true or not true. The experience 
of the race teaches this. The world 
is tired of beliefs: it wants truths, — 
larger truths. We care little for what 



men believe. We estimate them by 
their deeds. *'The world will Uttle 
note nor long remember what we say 
here. It will not forget what they did 
here.** Truth is the opposite of error 
and wrong: truth is right. The volume 
of truths is ever growing. It is much 
larger to-day than in ages past, and 
because of it life is more worth the 
living. Honesty, fair dealings, man 
with man, is the goal forever sought 
for. We choose as our leaders those 
who are broad-minded, unselfish, and 
just, — lovers of truth and right. Do 
imto others as you would that others 
should do unto you is a rule of conduct, 
for man and nation, that is not likely 
to fail. In the search for truth, in 
distinguishing right and wrong, the 
enlightened conscience should be our 
guide. 

THE COUNTRY HOME 

THE season of sojourn in the 
country is nearly ended. 
Probably more people have 
gone to the seashore and hillsides this 
year than ever before. The trans- 
portation companies and places of 
resort report the largest patronage on 
record. 

All over New England, as well as 
in other parts of the land, the summer 
cottage is a most picturesque and 
interesting feature in the landscape. 
These cottages cannot be dissociated 
from the old-fashioned farm-house or 
country home .where visitors are wont 
to be entertained. Of the latter some, 
in point of sanitary conditions and 
healthfulness, are all that could be 
desired. Others are far from being 
satisfactory, and often they are the 
occasion of deep solicitude on the part 
of the summer guests. 

Nature does much to render life in 
the country delightful. Mountains and 
woodlands, brooks and lakes, together 
with piu*e air and bright skies, are 
sources of endless charm. Why should 
man alone defile the face of nature?

It should not be necessary to say that 
scrupulous cleanliness should pervade 
every nook and comer of the human 
habitation, including bam, stable, and 
hennery. Any negligence here is a 
direct menace to health and comfort, 
the prime objects most people, in their 
summer outings, are seeking. 

In addition to cleanliness, two things 
are of paramount importance to the 
prosperity and welfare of the country 
home; namely, good roads and an un- 
contaminated supply of pure water. 
And what with mountain streams, fresh 
springs, and clear lakes it would seem 
that New England homes might be 
supplied with an abundance of pure 
water; and yet the places thus pro- 
vided are far too infrequent. The old- 
fashioned well is still too much in evi- 
dence. Why does not the farmer come 
to realize that these things are no in- 
considerable part of his assets, and, at 
the same time, are the main essentials 
of his welfare? It behooves every 
farmer to look well, first to the sani- 
tary conditions of his home, then to 
the making of improved roads upon 
which the prosperity of the community 
in which he lives so much depends. 

A leading household journal in a 
series of graphic object-lessons has 
been calling people's attention ex- 
tensively to the unsightly dumping- 
places and other ugly objects that dis- 
figure so many cities and towns of our 
land. Why so much of this sort of 
ugliness is tolerated is past understand- 
ing. However, the lesson for us to 
learn is that the artistic touch is, in 
the final estimate, the one thing need- 
ful to render the country home attrac- 
tive and complete. It is wonderful 
what the repair of fences, the removal 
of rubbish, the judicious use of paint, 
the setting of a few vines and trees, 
will sometimes accomplish. Neatness 
is sure sign of thrift. What every house- 
holder should aspire to is to make the 
most of his own environments and give 
nature a fair chance. The country 



home should be an appropriate and 
comely piece of handiwork, set amid 
the natiu^ framework of nature's 
designing.

A lady asked one of the children in

the sin of the Pharisees?" ''Eating 
camels, ma'am," was the reply. The

camels."

thought."

Green Pepper Omelet 
Cut a sweet green pepper in halves, 
lengthwise, and remove the seeds. 
Then cut the rest of the pepper in 
tiny shreds. Put a tablespoonful of 
butter in the omelet pan, and, when hot, 
add the pepper and cook about five 
minutes without browning, stirring 
meanwhile, that all may be uniformly 
softened. Have ready in a bowl four 
eggs, a scant half- tea spoonful of salt, 
and a dash of pepper beaten until a 
full spoonful can be taken up. Turn 
the egg over the pepper, shake the 
pan. or pick up the cooked egg with a 
fork, to let the uncooked mixture 
down onto the pan; when the egg 
is lightly set, roll, and turn onto a 
hot dish. 

Celery Souffle 
Wash and drain the tender white 
stalks in a head of celery, discarding the 
leaves, and cut the stalks into fine 
slices. Add a slice of mild onion, 
two sprigs of parsley, and white broth 



or boiling water to cover. Let cook 
about half an hour or until the celery 
is tender and the liquid evaporated. 
Remove the parsley and about half the 
celery, and press the onion and rest 
of the celery through a sieve. There 
should be of broth and pur^e about 
one-third a cup. Melt two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter. In it cook three table- 
spoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, and one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of paprika. Add the pur^e of celery 
and three-fourths a cup of rich milk, 
and stir until the sauce is boiling. 
Then beat in the beaten yolks of two 
eggs, one-fourth a cup of grated 
Parmesan cheese, and then cut and 
fold in the pieces of cooked celery, 
reserved for the purpose, and the whites 
of two eggs, beaten dry. Bake in a

ber pickles. Cover the fish, and set it 
aside in a cool place, to become sea- 
soned and chilled. Drain three or four 
sardines or wipe them on 
a cloth. Remove the skin 
and bones, and pound the 
flesh with the cooked yolks 
of three eggs to a smooth 
paste. Add salt and a

in alternately, and little 
by little, three tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar and five 
tablespoonfuls of oil. Mix 
the fi^ (carefully drained) 
with the dressing, and turn 
the whole onto a bed of lettuce leaves 
carefully washed and dried. Lay sar- 
dine fillets (halves of sardines freed 
frpm skin and bone) on the top of the 
salad, and serve at once. 

Roast Snipe 
Remove the feathers carefully, to 
avoid tearing the skin. Draw, but do 
not remove the head or feet. Singe over 
a tablespoonful of alcohol ig- 
nited on a saucer. Bring the 
feet back upon the second 
joints, pressing the legs close 
to the body. Truss the birds 
by turning the head under the 
wing and passing the long bill 
through the second joints and 
body. Tie a string around 
the legs and another around 
the breast, as in the illustra- 
tion, to hold the head and 
legs in position, though it is 
better to avoid the string 
around the breast, as it is 
liable to leave a mark when 
the bird is cooked. Bind a 
strip of bacon over the breasts 
or rub over the surface with 
butter. Cook in a hot oven 
about twenty minutes, bast- 
ing with melted butter four 
times. Dredge with salt and 
flour aftei^ the second basting. Serve 
on sUces of toast moistened with the 



liquid in the pan in which the birds 
are cooked. Garnish the dish with 
water-cress and slices of lemon.

and bake in a shallow pan, 
to make a sheet of cake 
about an inch and a quar- 
ter thick. When cold, 
spread a boiled frosting 
on the inverted cake, and 
sprinkle it with fine- 
chopped pistachio nuts. 
Cut the cake in strips an 
inch and a half wide, and 
these diagonally to make 
diamond -shaped pieces. 

Boiled Frosting

syrup spins a thread. Pour the syrup 
in a fine stream onto the white of an 
egg, beaten dry, beating meanwhile 
with a Dover egg- 
beater. Set the bowl 
in cold water, and con- 
tinue beating until the 
icing stiffens and holds

Vanilla Chestnut 
Preserve 

Cut a one-fourth- 
inch slit in each chest- 
nut shell. Then cook 
two minutes in boiling 
water. Drain and let 
dry in the frying-pan. 
Add a teaspoonful of butter or dripping 
for each pint of nuts, and shake the 
pan over the fire, to coat each nut. 
Then with a sharp knife inserted at 
the slit made for the purpose remove 
the shell and inner skin together, thus 
shelling and blanching the nuts at the 
same time. Keep the nuts covered 
until shelled, as this can be done more 
easily when the nuts are hot. Cover the 
blanched nuts with boihng water, and 
let simmer very gently until tender. It

two hours. Then drain off the syrup, 
and reduce to a good consistency. Add 
the chestnuts, let stand an hour, drain 
again, and reduce as before. Then store 
in jars. Flavor with vanilla, a table- 
spoonful to a quart, as soon as the 
nuts are cold, then set aside as rich 
preserves.

{scant measure). Add one-fourth a 
teaspoonful of salt, and return the whole 
to the fire to cook over hot water. 
Stir constantly until the mixture thick- 
ens. Then set into cold water, and 
beat while cooling. Then add half a 
cup of chestnuts, pressed through a 
sieve, and half a cup of sultana raisins 
and French candied fruit, cut small and 
soaked over night in maraschino to 
cover (or use maraschino cherries, cut 
fine). Have ready a pint of cream, 
beaten solid, and into this cut and fold 
the chestnut and fruit mixture. Turn 
into a mould lined with paper, filling 
the mould to overflow. Spread a paper 
over the cream, and over this press 
the cover. Then pack the mould in 
equal measures of salt and crushed ice. 



Silvcr-and-Gold Custardi 

Let stand about three hours. Serve 
garnished with whipped cream and dec- 
orated with slices of cherries and chest- 
nuts. 

Silver-and-Gold Custards 

(To serve five) 
Give the whites of five eggs a few 
beats with an egg-beater. Add one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
third a cup of sugar, and beat till well 
mixed. Then beat in one cup of rich 
milk or thin cream. Strain the mixt- 
ure into five timbal moulds, but- 
tered thoroughly and dredged with 
sugar. Bake on several folds of paper 
in a dish of hot water. Let cool 
thoroughly. Beat the yolks of five 
- eggs, add one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt and a scant half a cup of sugar, 



and beat again. Then stir into one 
pint of milk scalded over hot water. 
Cook, stirring constantly until the mixt- 
ure coats the spoon, then strain at 
once into a cold dish. When both 
custards are cold, turn the silver cus- 
tards into individual dishes, and pour 
the gold custard, flavored with vanilla, 
around them. 

South Chatham Lady Fingers 
Beat the yolks of three eggs until 
thick. Gradually beat in one-third 
a cup of sugar and a grating of lemon 
rind. Then cut and fold in a scant 
three-fourths a cup of flour and the 
white of one egg, beaten dry. Shape 
with a pastry bag and plain tube on 
waxed paper. Bake about ten minutes. 

Sponge Dominoes 
Bake South Chatham 
lady-finger mixture or 
other sponge cake 
mixture in a sheet one- 
fourth an inch thick. 
When cold , cut in pieces 
the shape of dominoes. 
Melt three ounces of 
chocolate, and with it 
cover one side of the 
dominoes. Have ready some blanched 
almonds. Split these while they are 
moist, and with a small cutter (a copper 
decorating tube is good) cut into tiny 
rounds for use in making dominoes 
of different numbers. 

Fruit-and-Nut Caramel Fudge 
Stir three cups of sugar and one cup 
of thin cream over the fire until the 
sugar is melted. Then boil without 
stirring to the soft-ball stage. At 
the same time stir one cup of sugar 
over the fire until it becomes caramel. 
Pour the first mixture into the caramel, 
and let boil up once. Take from the 
fire, and beat until thick, adding at 
the last half a cup of citron, candied 
cherries, pineapple, and plums cut 
fine, and one cup of pecan-nut meats.

After Breakfast Chat 



By Janet M. Hill 

D good humor, every part of the machinery of life must vibrate 



THIS is eminently a prosaic age. 
Women at table no longer 
pick at food, bird-fashion, but 
eat heartily, and are not ashamed of it. 
Literature and the arts are cultivated 
more successfully by the healthy and 
robust than by the hollow-eyed and 
pale-faced aenemic. Yet with all man- 
ner of things to eat there is a great 
dearth of satisfying food. Every one 
knows that a hungry man is a danger- 
ous member of society, but it is not as 
well known that every individual who 
is to attain his highest efficiency must 
be well nourished, and still less is the 
fact appreciated that savor may be 
made a means of making people con- 
tented and satisfied with their lot in life. 
Undoubtedly it is best that one be rest- 
less and desirous of improving his con- 
dition, but this restlessness must be 
kept within bounds; and a man with 
a full stomach is usually amenable to 
law and order. 

When people complain of their food, 
she who provides the food is inclined 
to say, "They will eat when they are 
hungry"; but the, fact is people in 
rural communities, children in public 
homes and institutions, patients and 
attendants in hospitals, and others 
of this class are chronically hungry, 
and cannot eat. These suffer from 
malnutrition, largely occasioned by 
monotony and lack of savor in food. 
There are many people, largely those 



of middle life and beyond, who eat too 
much; but there are also large numbers 
of people who eat too stnall a quantity 
of food. 

We give in this number menus for 
a home where children are cared for. 
In childhood it is that the seeds of 
health or disease, of success or failure 
in life, are sown, and primarily through 
the food that is supplied. When the 
elements necessary for the work of the 
body are lacking in food, either on 
account of quality or quantity, mate- ' 
rial is taken from the body itself, and 
warped nerves that will yield in the 
future a dividend in warped judgment 
and action is the sure result. 

The food of growing children shoidd 
be generous in quantity, varied in selec- 
tion, and so palatable that each and 
every child may enjoy it. Each meal 
should be a surprise, and looked for- 
ward to with pleasure. Expensive 
materials are not essential, but inex- 
pensive ones need to be handled with 
much more care than those that cost 
more, if they are to be made appetizing. 
Stews are wholesome for occasional 
use, but a superabundance of liquid or 
semi-liquid food is by no means desir- 
able, and will surely occasion various 
forms of indigestion. Some form of 
fat. especially in cool weather, is a 
necessity; and, if butter cannot be fur- 
nished plentifully, nuts, bacon, and 
puddings with beef suet are whole- 



152 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



some substitutes. Let the bacon be 
cooked with care, that no short moment 
of over-heat discolor the thin shaving 
of meat or the delicate fat in the pan. 
This fat will ftunish a dainty relish to 
baked potatoes or stale bread, or it 
may be used in preparing the nut loaf, 
a picture of which is given on page 140, 
and the recipe in answer to Query 1 163. 
This dish is hearty and suitable for all 
save young children. A dish of tart 
apple sauce may replace the slice of 
orange recommended with each service. 
Note that the loaf is cooked on a per- 
forated sheet and in a moderate oven. 
The recipe will serve sixteen or eighteen 
people. Popcorn — what child is not 
made happy with com and popper? — 
and milk will afford a welcome Sunday 
night supper, and ftunish occupation for 
several children in the afternoon. 
**With less luxury there is quite as 
much that is charming, gay, and delight- 
ful." The number of dishes suggested 
in the menus for each meal is small, 
and each can be prepared and cooked 
with the minimum of effort. 

Roasting and Cooking of Meats 

With the advent of cooler weather, 
roasts of beef, mutton, and fowl, are 
again given more place in the menus. 
A French chef of note is author of the 
thought that any chef who adds one 
drop of bouillon to the pan during the 
roasting of a joint should be driven 
from the country. In our own printed 
direction for roasting joints we say 
baste with dripping, to which hot 
water may be added if there be danger 
of the fat in the pan bimiing. How- 
ever, the remedy should be less heat 
rather than a liquid like water or stock. 
These create steam, and change the 
character of the dish being cooked. 
Roasting, as it is conducted to-day in 
well-ventilated ovens, if basting with 
hot fat, kept at a proper temperature, 
be judiciously applied, produces a dish 
with a savor of the open fire less only 



in degree from that of the joint cooked 
on the. old-fashioned spit. The three 
things to be looked out for are the per- 
fectly ventilated oven, frequent basting 
with hot fat from the start (a joint 
cannot be basted too much), and high 
heat at first, followed by heat that does 
not bimi the fat in the pan. • 

Now that chickens are of fair size, 
partridge and quail seasonable, cas- 
serole cookery is again to the fore. 
Do not attempt the preliminary sau- 
t6ing in the casserole. The frying-pan 
presents more surface, and is in every 
way a more suitable utensil for this 
purpose. A casserole of chicken pre- 
pared for the return of a family that 
failed to return for the appointed meal, 
when reheated in the tmopened cas- 
serole, gave a most pleastu^ble surprise. 
The dish surpassed itself. The same 
thing is true of curries, various stews, 
and ragouts. Kept hot for several 
hours over hot water, or reheated after 
standing, the flavors of the various 
ingredients have permeated the meat 
through and through, and the dish 
seems richer by far than when eaten 
the instant it is cooked. 

As served at fine hotels and restau- 
rants, casserole dishes are prepared 
with onion, carrot, fresh mushrooms, 
and sherry wine. These with slow 
cooking in a closely covered dish, after 
the preliminary browning in hot fat, 
give the flavor characteristic of the dish, 
but one or more of these items may be 
omitted, and celery or green peas, in 
season, substituted for the carrot and 
mushrooms. Birds are cooked whole, 
trussed as for roasting. Chickens may 
be separated at the joints or, neatly 
trussed, cooked whole. Cooked the 
latter way, carve in the dish or on a 
platter, to which they are lifted at 
the table by the carver. A young 
chicken of two or three pounds in 
weight requires an hour and a half of 
cooking. Casseroles can be purchased 
that will hold two trussed chickens. 



Failure and Success in Cake-making 

By Mary D. Chambers 



THE writer's first attempt at 
cooking was an effort to make 
black currant jam. Fresh cur- 
rants were picked from the garden, 
sugar abstracted from the store closet, 
the two compounded together with 
a fearful and guilty joy, and the mixt- 
ure set over a bright fire to cook — in 
a wooden drinking vessel ! 

Next came a series of events when, 
as a reward for almost supernatttral 
good behavior, she was given an egg 
to **do what she liked with." Need- 
less to ask what she liked: it was 
always to make cake. The cake was 
mixed 'after some' original fashion, and 
baked in a tin canister. Well, some- 
*times parts of it were good enough to 
eat. Perhaps this measure of success 
was an incentive to perseverance, for 
cake is now one of the few, the very 
few things she really thinks she can 
make, and her love for this dainty is 
undiminished. The invitation of stu- 
dents to partake of dishes compounded 
in class is generally politely declined, 
but the offer of a piece of cake — good, 
bad, or indifferent — is always accepted. 
In no other lesson is the same interest 
on the part of the students observed, 
and this is the case with classes of all 
ages. The word **cake" brings forth 
an expression of content and joy on 
every face. There is completeness of 
absorption in her work on the part of 
every student, and they measure and 
sift and mix and compare batters 
with critical judgment, and in general 
act with a magnified and dispropor- 
tioned sense of the importance of their 
function that this misguided teacher 
finds charming. In this work during 
the past decade teacher and students 
alike have learned and unlearned 
much that it is now a pleasiu'e, in re- 
sponse to a request from a reader of 
this magazine, to communicate to all 
makers and lovers of cake. 



Essential Ingredients in Cake ' 

Flour. For the best results this 
should be pastry flour, which is much 
whiter than bread flour, smoother in 
texture, and capable of retaining the 
impression of the fingers when squeezed 
in the hand. The best quality of 
pastry flour will under no circumstances 
make really good bread, being what is 
technically known as a **weak flour." 
The difference between this and a 
*' strong" or good bread flour is due 
to the quality rather than quantity of 
the gluten content. Gluten is formed 
by the combination, in presence of 
water, of two proteid bodies found in 
wheat, gUadin and glutenin. When the 
proportion of glutenin is large, a "weak" 
flour is the result. Where, however, 
gUadin is in excess, the flotw will be 
strong, yellowish, and capable of 
being kneaded into an elastic mass. 
Hence it is obvious that the use of 
eggs is indicated with pastry flour, to 
impart the needed viscosity. Bread 
flour may, nevertheless, be substituted, 
if about one-eighth of the amount 
called for by the recipe be deducted, 
or, if a very strong flour be used, a 
mixture of one part cornstarch to three 
parts flour will give good results. 

Sugar. Many older recipes call for 
powdered or confectioner's sugar, be- 
cause several years ago granulated 
sugar was either unknown or manu- 
factured in coarser quahty, whose large 
crystals spoiled the texture of the cake. 
To-day, however, granulated sugar can 
be used for all cakes except a very fine 
wafer mixture, where a satin smooth- 
ness of surface is desired. Brown 
sugar and molasses, if used for sweeten- 
ing, will cause the cake to keep fresh 
longer. 

Butter. This, needless to say, should 
be of excellent quahty, and, where a 
white cake is desired, should be free 



154 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



from added coloring matter. The 
natural color of butter is easily de- 
composed by the process of creaming, 
so that it can be beaten quite white. 
The dye, however, used in many cream- 
eries dtu'ing the winter months is 
more stable, and often impossible to de- 
compose by creaming. 

Eggs. Preferably one day old. Will 
beat up better. The average-sized 
egg, weighing two ounces, and in vol- 
ume about one-fourth of a cup, is 
usually meant, unless stated otherwise 
in the recipe. 

Baking-powder. As the manipula- 
tion in fine cake-making is somewhat 
slow, a baking-powder that does not 
immediately yield all of its gas on con- 
tact with liquid is preferable. This 
can easily be tested by mixing a little 
in water, and noting the duration of 
the effervescence. 

Wetting. Bggs form a large propor- 
tion of the wetting in most cakes. For 
the remainder, milk, water, tea, coffee, 
beer, etc., may be used. Water, at 
a pinch, may always be substituted 
for milk. The cake will be less rich, 
often more delicate and tender, not so 
fine-flavored, and will not keep fresh 
so long. The potassitun salts in milk 
exercise a deliquescent influence which 
helps to keep the cake moist. Beer, 
by virtue of the action of its diastase, 
also tends to keep a cake moist, and 
the small amount of alcohol present, 
three to five per cent., will be dissipated 
by the heat of baking. 

Flavoring. Orange juice and lemon 
juice are apt to lose their flavor, lemon 
juice nearly completely, on exposure 
to baking temperature. The grated 
rind, being careful to use only the 
outside yellow (as the least bit of 
the white in combination with other 
ingredients imparts a permanently 
bitter flavor), gives a delicious flavor 
of the fruit. Of the manufactured 
flavorings the fruit sugars, or flavoring 
sugars, are more apt to retain the flavor 
during baking than the extracts, as 



the characteristic taste is lost to a 
great extent in volatilization of the 
alcohol. 

Proportions and Method 

An ordinary cake batter is a thick 
batter; that is, a batter which, when 
poured into the baking-pan, does not 
immediately sink to a level. In stun- 
mer, or where the manipulation is 
performed in a warm room, it will 
sink a little quicker than when the 
temperature is lower. When fruit or 
nuts are used, the batter may be 
slightly stiffer. Many failures in cake- 
making occur, when the maximum of 
butter is used, from having the batter 
too thin. Twice as much flour, by vol- 
mne, as wetting, — the .wetting to include 
eggs as well as milk or other liquid, — 
is an approximately good proportion for. 
a cake batter, but no exact ride can be 
given, owing to the difference in flours. 
A very Uttle practice suffices to develop 
judgment as to proper consistency 
of the batter. Needless to say, in any 
recipe where eggs are substituted for 
milk or other wetting, the amotmt of 
the latter must be diminished pro- 
portionately; that is to say, four eggs, 
or a cup of eggs, is not equal as wetting 
to a cup of milk, on accoimt of their 
greater density and the large amount 
of coagulable material present, but a cup 
of eggs may safely be regarded as equal 
to half the volume of milk. This rule, 
again, is subject to correction by the 
appearance of the batter. 

The maximum of butter can hardly, 
with safety, be in excess of one-third 
the volume of flour. More than this 
will cause the cake to "fall," in most 
cases. When nuts, chocolate, or any 
other substance rich in fat, is added 
to the batter, it is well to deduct one- 
fourth a cup of butter for every cup 
of nuts, etc., used. By the way, a quar- 
ter of a teaspoonftd extra of salt to 
every cup, when nuts are used, en- 
hances their flavor wonderfully. 

The amount of baking-powder de- 



Failure and Success in Cake-making

pends on the constituents of said 
powder. For instance, a tartaric adcl 
baking-powder, molecular weight 318, 
evolves a weight of CO2 equal to 88. 
A cream of tartar powder, molecular 
weight 272, evolves gas equal to 44; 
an alum powder, weight 1021, gas 
264; a phosphate baking-powder, 
weight 804, gas 176. Postulating that 
a teaspoonful of any of the baking- 
powders of commerce approximates 
almost exactly in weight a teaspoonful 
of any other, the gas evolved by the 
cream of tartar powder may be rep- 
resented by I, that by the J:artaric acid 
1.2, the alum 4, and the phosphate 
1.5. This is somewhat offset by the 
greater stability of the cream of tartar 
powder, the evolution of gas not being 
completed until heat is appHed to the 
batter. The above figures do not rep- 
resent, to the writer's knowledge, the 
exact yield in gas per given weight 
of any baking-powder of commerce: 
they are the result of laboratory ex- 
periments with constituents typical 
of the chief classes of manufactured 
powders. Each housekeeper has prob- 
ably her favorite brand, and has learned 
by experience how much to use. 

Two-thirds as much sugar as flour 
is ample, * even for those who hke a 
very sweet cake. If more is used, it 
will be di£Scult to avoid burning, and 
the cake will be more apt to fall. 

After creaming the butter, the sugar 
is gradually added, then the eggs, then 
the dry mixture of flour, salt, and bak- 
ing-powder, sifted together, is added 
alternately with the milk or other 
wetting. This is to avoid curdhng 
the batter by the addition of cold 
liquid to the softened butter. Such 
curdling always causes coarse textiu^e. 
Flavoring and fruit are added last. 
But these rules may not only with 
impunity, but advantage, be disre- 
garded. The fruit may be mixed 
with the flour, may be added to the 
creamed butter and sugar, if a darker 



cake is Uked, or, when added last, 
may either be heated to plumpness 
in the oven or lightly floured before 
adding. Heating, or mixing with the 
butter and sugar, diminishes the density 
of the fruit. Flour on the outside in- 
creases friction. Both methods tend 
to prevent sinking of the fruit in the 
batter. The eggs may be broken 
whole into the mixture of butter and 
sugar: this gives a heavier cake, but 
one which will keep fresh longer. 
They may be beaten before addition, 
or yolk and white may be separated, 
the beaten yolks added to the creamed 
butter and sugar, and the whites, 
stiffly beaten, added the last thing 
to the batter. The maximum of Ught- 
ness is attained by this method, but 
the cake will dry out quicker. The 
amoimt of baking-powder may always 
be reduced, when many eggs are used, 
to the extent of from one-quarter to one- 
half a teaspoonful less for each egg than 
would be used for a plain mixtiu'e. 

Students have often experimented 
successfully in simplifying the process 
of making cake. They have mixed all 
the dry material, all the wet, stirred 
the two together, and added the 
melted butter last. In this method 
they have learned that stirring the 
batter much before the addition of the 
butter toughens the mixture, stirring 
it after the butter is added makes it 
tender. Then they have "dumped" 
everything together, indiscriminately, 
into a big bowl, the butter being just 
softened, and beat them all up at once 
until a fine-textiu"ed batter was made, 
resulting in an excellent cake. They 
have stirred the baking-powder in the 
last thing, which, by the way, is a 
logical method of using a powder that 
gives off the gas at once. They have 
omitted baking-powder and substituted 
manipulation. In short, we may say 
that the rules for making cake are 
flexible, and the work gives boundless 
opportunity for individuality.

When the tape-needle is mislaid,

always at hand) of a size to enter the

In making crust for lemon pies, it 
is advisable to bake the sheUs before 
filling. These will retain their shape 
better if baked over an inverted pie 
plate, well greased on the outside. In 
this way the dough does not shrink 
down into the bottom of the plate, as 
when baked in the old way. 

The old-fashioned lamp chimney may 
serve a useful purpose other than that 
of illumination, in farm-houses and 
houses not of modern construction. 
It is more convenient, when illness in 
the night calls for a hot appUcation, to 
use a heated lamp chimney wrapped 
in a cloth, without getting out of bed, 
than to repair to the kitchen for hot 
water. 

Even two or three hat -pins will not 
always serve to secure the wire frames 
of modem millinery construction to 
milady's head upon a windy day. A 
few stout hair-pins thrust through the 
crown underneath, where it touches 
the head, and pinned to the hair, serve 
to hold the hat firmly. If the hat be 



of felt or other material too stiff for a 
hair-pin to penetrate, make some small 
loops underneath to accommodate the 
hair-pins. 

In frying fish, to avoid odors and a

AT this time of the year almost 
every housekeeper has a quantity 
of jelly left from last year which she 
wishes to use before making a fresh 
supply. Jelly makes a very pleasant 
addition to lemonade, used in the fol- 
lowing way: Dissolve a small glass of 
jelly in boiling water, add the juice of 
two lemons and a quart of water. 
A combination of two or three flavors 
is very good, as quince and apple jelly 
flavored with geranium leaf, grape and 
crab-apple, quince and black currant, 
or any others that one happens to have 
at hand. 

The brandy from brandied peaches 
used in an emergency to flavor the 
grape-fruit, orange, or canteloupes, 
was pronounced superior to the usual 
madeira, sherry, or maraschino. This 
was also a pleasant addition to the 
jelly lemonade. 

The dissolved jelly mixed with rather 
thick cream, flavored with the brandy, 
makes a good pudding sauce for plain 
rice or tapioca pudding, served either 
hot or cold. 

A teaspoonful of the bottled tama- 
rinds in a glass of water is a refreshing 
drink, and a good substitute for lemon- 
ade. Lemon juice and water without 
sugar is very acceptable on stunmer days, 
served at meals instead of water, and 
is also an aid to digestion. 

Stains on white clothing that can- 
not be removed by boiling yield to the 
following exceedingly simple method 
used by an Irish laundress. After 
washing thoroughly, hang the article 
in the sun, dripping wet. When dry, 
dip into cold water again, and hang out 
dripping wet. Repeat as many times 
as necessary. This renders the cloth- 
ing beautifully white and clean with- 
out the labor and heat of boiling.

IN answer to many queries concern- 
ing the *' monkey stove," I will say 
that it much resembles a laundry stove. 
The top is larger, however, and the 
additional oven is inserted in the pipe. 
For economy both in fuel and original 
price of stove, and for use in small 
families, it is the happy medium. It 
burns coal or wood, the first mentioned 
being most satisfactory. 

The fire-bowl being small, wood has 
to be cut in small chunks, and soon bums 
out. 

To keep fire over night, see that there 
is a good body fire, and cover with good 
quality of coal. Then lay a stove-Hfter 
under the front lid of stove to keep 
it open about an inch, and close lower 
drafts. Open damper in pipe. By 
so manipulating it, it will furnish 
enough heat during the night to take 
the chill off the room. 

In furnishing light housekeeping 
rooms for students in the winter time, 
it meets all requirements, both for 
heating and cooking. Should any of 
my readers purchase one, be sure to 
have the damper placed above the 
oven. Some tinners, ignorant of the 
workings of this little stove, will place 
the damper below, and then the oven 
will not bake ; while, when placed prop- 
erly, there is no trouble. 

The ''monkey stove" is not a ** thing 
of beauty," but a "joy forever."

SOILED and limp straw hats in white 
and cream color can be nicelv 
cleaned and stiffened by washing in a 
weak solution of oxalic acid. Remove 
all trimming. Dissolve one or two table- 
spoonfuls — one need not be exact — 
of the crystals in a bowl of warm water. 
Wash hat thoroughly, using a nail- 
brush. Rinse well in two clear waters, 
and dry in sun and air. Men's hats 
are particularly easy to clean, as are 
all chip, Milan, and stiff straws. In 
the case of colored straws that look

faded and are limp, try washing in 
warm ivory soap-suds with brush. 

If housekeepers realized the con- 
venience of small gummed labels, like 
those druggists use, they would never 
be without them. In fruit canning 
season they are a boon. No htmting 
for paste nor cutting of paper. Just 
write the name, moisten, and stick 
on jar. They are also most useful for 
numerous other things, such as labeling 
boxes and bags and bundles stored 
away full of various things, on bot- 
toms of plates, glasses, tin or china- 
ware when used for picnics or church 
socials. They are cheap, costing about 
ten cents per hundred. 

A black and white shepherd check, 
all-wool, pleated skirt, which was hope- 
lessly soiled and badly spotted, was 
successfully cleaned by immersing at 
night in a bath-tub half filled with 
cold water, to which had been added 
a small cake of ivory soap, first shaved, 
cooked to a jelly in boiling water, and 
two tablespoonfuls of borax. Next 
morning this water, which was very 
dirty, was drawn off, and the skirt 
was soused up and down in clean clear 
water of same temperature. This was 
drawn off, and followed by two more 
rinse waters, taking care to have all of 
same temperature. No rubbing. The 
skirt was then hung out of doors on 
the line without wringing at all, in a 
warm, sunny place, and in six hours 
was perfectly dry, and so smooth as 
scarcely to need pressing. It was 
pressed imder a damp cloth, however, 
and looked like new. 

This method is equally successful 
with white woolen materials. Noth- 
ing will shrink in the least; but some 
colors will fade and run even in cold 
soap-suds, and one should try a piece 
before washing anything about which 
there is any uncertainty. 

To keep cut flowers fresh longer than 
usual, immerse the stems for a minute 
or two in boiling water. Then put in 
cold water. This method is particu- 



larly recommended for poppies. They 
will keep for two days if gathered early 
and treated thus, where otherwise they 
would shatter in a few hours.

Green Almonds 

TO those who have not been in 
California the green almonds now 
on sale in Eastern cities are a curiosity. 
They resemble flattened, green, and 
rather shriveled peaches. They sell 
for thirty-five cents per pound. For 
the palates of those who prefer fresh 
nuts, the dried ones, conmionly used 
and preferred in the United States, 
such as English walnuts, pecans, hick- 
ory, etc., can be freshened in water 
with good results. A good rinsing, 
or brief soaking removes the astringent, 
bark-like taste sometimes most notice- 
able in some grades of pecan nuts. 
Especially is this desirable when the 
nut-meats are bought already shelled, 
for the washing removes any chance of 
dust or soil of handling, and freshens 
them, thereby making them far pleas- 
anter either for a salad or any other use.

QuSRY 1163. — ^Mrs. M. W. J., Holton, Kan.: 
"Recipe for nut loaf given in the Boston 
Cooking-School Magazine several years ago 
in an article by Helen Campbell." 

Nut Loaf 

(Vol. V. Boston Cooking-School Magaxine,) 

Crumble the inside of stale white 
bread, and cut the crust fine. Then 
dry the whole slowly for two hours in a 
warm oven. Use a granite pan, and 
stir the crumbs occasionally. Dry 
the crumbs without browning them. 
To three pints of crumbs, measiu-ed 
before drying, add one teaspoonful of 
salt, one tablespoonful of minced 
parsley, one tablespoonful of dried 
sage leaves, crumbled fine before meas- 
uring, half a teaspoonful of black 
pepper, one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
cayenne, one-eighth a teaspoonful of 
summer savory, one pint of celery (cut 
fine or ground), and one sour apple 
in thin bits. Melt one-third a pound 
of butter, and in it fry for five min- 
utes one onion of medium size, chopped 
fine. Pour this over the other ingre- 
dients, and mix thoroughly. Beat 
three eggs. Add one pint of milk, 
and pour over the mixture. Let stand 
to soften the crumbs while three cups 
of nut-meats — pecans, filberts, and 
Brazil nuts — are ground fine. Re- 
serve one tablespoonful of the ground 
nuts for the sauce, and mix the rest 
into the crumbs. When the whole is 
well mixed, shape it into a loaf four 



inches wide and three or more inches 
thick. Butter a perforated tin sheet, 
set the loaf upon it, and set to cook in 
a rather slow oven. Bake one hour 
and a half, basting often with butter 
melted in hot water. Serve on a hot 
platter. Garnish with slices of orange 
and parsley. Serve the sauce in a 
separate dish. This will serve about 
a dozen people. 

Sauce for Nut Loaf 

Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter 
in a hot omelet pan. Add a teaspoon-

milk and a cup of hot water in which 
the glaze from the baking-pan has been

Beat the yolks of three eggs and 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of mace or 
a grating of nutmeg until light and 
thick. Gradually beat in half a cup 
of sugar. Then cook and stir over 
hot water until slightly thickened. 
Then cut and fold in the whites of three 
eggs, beaten dry, letting the mixture 
stand over hot water, meanwhile, to 
set the egg. When the mixture is 
cold, add from one-fourth to one-half 
a cup of Jamaica rum and one cup of 
thick cream, beaten stiflF. Serve very 
cold, or pack in equal measures of salt 
and crushed ice, and serve half frozen. 

Egg Coffee 

The white of one egg will clear coffee 
in which about eight level tablespoon- 
fuls of the ground berry are used or 
four cups of coffee. Use less white of 
egg when less coffee is required. Take 
the white of egg, the crushed shell also, 
the ground coffee, and a tablespoonful 
of cold water for each tablespoonful of 
coffee. Mix these together thoroughly. 
Let stand three or four minutes. Then 
pour on fresh boihng water, and let 
boil five minutes after boiling begins. 
Pour a little cold water, one-fourth to 
one-half a cup, down the spout, and 
set the pot where the coffee will keep

"At what temperature should bread, angel 
cake, sponge cake, and macaroons be baked ?" 

Temperature for Baking Bread, etc. 

In considering the temperature at 
which various articles should be baked, 
it is impossible to make hard-and-fast 
rules, applicable to all ovens and all 
kinds of fuel. Oven thermometers 
or "heat indicators,'' set in the door 
of modem cook-stoves, are not identical. 
Heat indicators are of great assistance 
in deciding the. temperature suitable 
for different articles of food, but each 
must learn to use her special indicator. 
Experience is the pnme essential to 
good baking. With an oven ther- 
mometer the temperature can be ad- 
justed according to the size of the loaf. 
A loaf of French bread calls for higher 
temperature than the larger, square, 
household loaf. The French bread 
might be baked in thirty minutes in an 
oven at 360^ Fahr., while the household 
loaf, put into an oven at 300® Fahr., 
after ten minutes reducing the tempera- 
ture to 260® Fahr., might be baked 
in sixty minutes. Angel and sponge 
cakes might be put into an oven at 
about 250° Fahr., and be baked with 
increasing heat. Many cooks think 
an angel cake should be put into an 
oven at a slightly higher temperature 
than that demanded for a sponge cake 
m^e with both the whites and volks 



of the eggs. Macaroons require about 
the same temperature as sponge cake. 



Query 1169. — Mrs. C. D., Los Angeles, 
Cal.: "How may cream of tomato soup be 
kept from curdling? Recipes for macaroni 
croquettes and drop cookies with sour cream." 

Curdling of Tomato Soup 
Have the white sauce, used as the 
foundation of this soup, in one dish 
and the tomato pur6e in another, 
both very hot. Mix, and send to the 
table at once without further cooking. 

Macaroni Croquettes 

Let half a cup of macaroni, broken 
in half-inch lengths, cook in rapidly 
boiling salted water imtil tender. Drain 
and rinse in cold water, then drain 
again and dry by spreading on a cloth. 
Make a sauce of two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, three tablespoonfuls 
of flour, one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt, a dash of paprika, and a cup of 
milk, cream, well-seasoned and flavored 
stock, or tomato purde. Add the mac- 
aroni, two tablespoonfuls of grated 
cheese (Parmesan preferably), and, if 
convenient, oiie-fourth a cup of cooked 
tongue or ham, chopped fine. Mix 
thoroughly, and turn into a shallow 
pan. When cold, roll into such shapes 
as desired. Roll these in grated cheese, 
cover with a beaten egg diluted with a 
tablespoonful of cold water or milk, 
then roll in sifted bread crumbs. Fry 
in deep fat. Serve with or without 
tomato sauce. 

Drop Cookies with Sour Cream 

Cream half a cup of butter. Gradu- 
ally beat in one cup of sugar, then one 
egg, beaten light, and half a cup of 
sour cream, mixed with one-fourth

QuBRY 1 170.— Mrs. T. B. W., St. Paul, 
Minn.: "How thick should an English mutton 
chop be cut? Should the bone be Pienched 
and served with a paper frill? What kind 
of potatoes should be served with the dish? 
When should cranberry sherbet be served, 
with roast turkey instead of cranberry sauce 
or between the roast and game courses? Is 
it proper to serve mint ice in the place of 
mint sauce with hot roast lamb ? Is it proper 
to serve cturant jelly with broiled chicken 
and cold lamb ? How are the best club sand- 
wiches made?" 

Regarding Mutton Chops 

English mutton chops do not Con- 
tain a rib bone. They correspond to 
the small sirloin steaks in beef that 
have a piece of tenderloin on one side, 
above this a strip of less tender meat, 
edged with a ridge of fat, and a tough 
flank end. They are usually cut from 
an inch to an inch and a half thick. 
Potatoes in any style rather than plain 
boiled are served with chops. Pos- 
sibly French fried or Saratoga potatoes 
are the favorite styles to serve with 
broiled chops in this country. To- 
mato sauce accompanies a dish of 
breaded-and-fried chops. This com- 
bination, though not originating with 
Charles Dickens, is repeatedly referred 
to by this author. 

Rib chops, having the bone shortened 
and scraped clean of flesh, are known 
as French or Frenched chops. After 
cooking, a paper frill is sUpped over the 
end of the bone. By this means the 
chop may be eaten from the fingers 
without soiling them. 

Place of Cranberry Ice and Mint 

Sherbet in Menu 
We think cranberry ice and mint 
sherbet should be served with roast 
turkey and lamb, respectively, rather 
than between the courses. We see no 
reason why currant jelly should not be 
served with broiled chicken and cold 



lamb, unless it be that these are accom- 
panied by a salad, as tomato with 
mayonnaise dressing, when the jelly 
might seem a superfluity. 

Qub Sandwiches 

Cut bread into triangular pieces, 
toast, then spread with mayonnaise 
dressing. Cover half of the slices 
with crisp heart leaves of lettuce, and 
on these lay thin slices of cold chicken 
breast. Cover these with fresh-broiled 
breakfast bacon. Over the bacon lay a 
second lettuce leaf, and cover the whole 
with the second slice of toast spread 
with mayonnaise. Garnish each end 
with a heart leaf of lettuce containing 
a spoonful of mayonnaise. 



Query 1x71.— Mrs. R. H. W., Charles aty, 
la.: "Recipes for pie crust, piccalilli, and 
raisin filling for pie in which cream is used, 
also for Graham gems and wheat-flour pan- 
cakes in which buttermilk and eggs are used." 

Pie Crust 
Pass through a sieve together three 
cups of sifted pastry flour, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful 
of baking-powder. With a knife or 
the tips of the fingers work into this 
mixture two-thirds a cup of shortenmg. 
When each little particle of fat is coated 
with flour, add gradually, mixing 
meanwhile with a knife, enough cold 
water to make a paste that sticks to- 
gether without adhering to the knife or 
bowl. Roll the paste, with the knife, 
in the bowl to take up all the particles 
of dough or flour, then turn onto a 
board hghtly dredged with flour. Roll 
it in the flour, then pat it with the 
rolling-pin into a rectangular shape, 
and roll out into a long strip. Roll 
this up tight like a jelly roll, and use, 
when desired. This will make two 
pies. For a more flaky pastry prepare 
as above, using but half a cup of short- 
ening, then, when the paste is rolled 
out into the rectangular sheet, spread it 
with one-fourth or one-half a cup of 
shortening, then fold it three times.

or roll it up, pat, and roll out again, and 
it is ready for use. 

Piccalilli 

Chop fine half a peck of green 
tomatoes, one head of cabbage, fifteen 
white onions, and ten large green cucum- 
bers. Put a layer of the vegetables 
into a porcelain dish, and sprinkle with 
salt. Continue the layers of vegetables 
and salt until all are used. Let stand 
over night, then drain, discarding the 
liquid, wringing the vegetables in a 
cloth, if necessary. Heat three quarts 
of cider vinegar, three pounds of brown 
sugar, one-fourth a cup of tumeric 
(the tum?iij may be omitted), one- 
fourth a cup of black pepper seed, one 
ounce of celery seed, three-fourths a 
pound of mustard seed, and three red 
peppers, chopped fine, to the boiling- 
point, and pour over the vegetables. 
Let stand over night. Then drain the 
liquid from the ve.getables, reheat and 
again pour over the vegetables. Re- 
peat this process the third morning. 
Then, when the mixture becomes cold, 
stir into it one-fourth a pound of 
ground mustard and one teaspoonful 
of curry powder, mixed with one 
cup of olive oil and one quart of vinegar. 

Raisin Filling with Cream 

Chop fine one cup and a half oT seeded 
raisins. Beat the yolks of three eggs. 
Beat again with one -third a cup of 
sugar, one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt, and, if desired, the grated rind and 
juice of a lemon. Add the prepared 
raisins, mix well, then stir in one cup 
of cream, and turn the mixture into the 
prepared crust. Cover with a second 
crust. Bake about thirtv-five minutes 
in a rather moderate oven. 

Graham Gems with Buttermilk and 

Eggs 

Sift together one cup, each, of 

Graham and white flour, three level 

teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, half a 

teaspoonful of salt, and one-fourth a cup 



of sugar. Beat one egg, add one cup 
and a fourth of buttermilk mixed with 
a scant half-teaspoonful of soda, and 



The Way Out 

Change of Food brought Success and Happiness 

An ambitious but delicate girl, after 
failing to go through school on account 
of nervousness and hysteria, found in 
Grape-nuts the only thing that seemed 
to build her up and furnish her the peace 
of health. 

"From infancy,'* she says, **1 have 
not been strong. Being ambitious to 
learn at any cost, I finally got to the 
High School, but soon had to abandon 
my studies on account of nervous 
prostration and hysteria. 

"My food did not agree with me. 
I grew thin and despondent. I could 
not enjoy the simplest social affair, for 
I suffered constantly from nervousness 
in spite of all sorts of medicines. 

"This wretched condition continued 
until I was twenty-five, when I became 
mterested in the letters of those who 
had cases like mme and who were being 
cured by eating Grape-ntxts. 

'I had little faith, but procured a box, 
and after the first dish I experienced a 
peculiar satisfied feeling that I had 
never gained from any ordinary food. 
I slept and rested better that night, 
and in a few days began to grow 
stronger. 

*'I had a new feeling of peace and 
restfulness. In a few weeks, to my 
great joy, the headaches and nervous- 
ness left me, and life became bright and 
hopeful. I resumed my studies, and 
later taught ten months with ease, — 
of course using Grape-nuts every day. 
It is now four years since I began to use 
Grape-nuts. I am the mistress erf a 
happy home, and the old weakness has 
never returned." Name given by 
Postum Company, Battle Creek, Mich.

book, • 'The Road to Wellville," in pack- 
ages.

stir into the dry ingredients with 
three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 
Bake in a hot, well-buttered muffin- 
pan about twenty-five minutes. The 
recipe is for thick sour buttermilk. If 
the buttermilk be very thick, a few 
spoonfuls of sweet milk may be needed, 
to make the dough of the right con- 
sistency. If the buttermilk be sweet, 
omit the soda, and use four rather than 
three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder.

Crystallized Cherries and Pineapple 
Remove stones from cherries and 
the outer waste portion from the pine- 
apple. Cut the pineapple in slices, 
and stamp out the core with a small 
round cutter. Cook the fruit in boihng' 
water to cover until tender. Weigh 
the fruit before cooking; make a syrup 
of an equal weight of sugar and a cup 
of the fruit liquid (water in which it 
was cooked) for each pound of sugar. 
Let the fruit stand over night in the 
syrup, then pour off the syrup, cook to 
the thread stage, and pour it again 
over the fruit. Bring the whole to the 
boiling-point, and set aside. Drain 
off the S)rrup on succeeding days, and 
repeat the boiling, etc., until the syrup, 
after the fruit is added and the whole 
is heated, is at the thread stage, then 



Family Runt 

Kansas Man says Coffee made him that 

"Coffee has been used in our family 
of eleven — father, mother, five sons, 
and four daughters — for thirty years. 
I am the eldest of the boys, and have 
always been considered the runt of the 
family and a coffee toper. 

**I continued to drink it for years 
until I grew to be a man, and then I 
fotmd I had stomach trouble, nervous 
headaches, poor circulation, was unable 
to do a full dav*s work, took medicine 
for this, that, and the other thing with- 
out the least benefit. In fact, I only 
weighed 116 when I was 28. 

"Then I changed from coffee to Pos- 
ttun, being the first one in Our family 
to do so. I noticed, as did the rest of 
the family, that I was surely gainijig 
strength and flesh. Shortly after I was 
visiting my cousin, who said : * You look 
so much better. You're getting fat.* 

"At breakfast his wife passed me a 
large-sized cup of coffee, as she knew I 
was always sttch a coffee-drinker, but 
I said, *No, thank you.' 

"*What!* said my Cousin, 'you quit 
coffee ? What do you drink ?' 

"'Postum,' I said, *or water, and I 
am well.' They did not know what 
Postum was, but my cousin had stom- 
ach trouble, and could not sleep at night 
from drinkmg a large cup of coffee three 
times a day. He .was glad to learn 
about Postum, but said he never knew 
coffee hurt any one. 

"After understanding my condition 
and how I got Well, he knew what to. do 
for himself. He discovered that coffee 
was the cause of his trouble, as he never 
used tobacco or anything else of the 
kind. You should now see the change 
in him. We both believe that, if 
persons who suffer from coffee-drinking 
would stop and use Postum, they could 
build bdck to health and happiness.*'

For candied fruit, store the fruit after 
it has absorbed all the syrup possible, 
but do not stir it in the S3rrup. 

Macaroons and Crescents from Al- 
mond Paste 
With the hand beat half a pound of 
almond paste and the white of an egg 
to a perfectly smooth mass. Then 
gradually beat in half a pound (one 
and three-fourths cups) of confec- 
tioner's sugar, and, When the mixture 
is well beaten, beat in, one at a time, 
the unbeaten whites of two eggs. 
Beat until the mixture is very light. 
Shape the mixture into small rounds 
on two thicknesses of paper laid on a 
baking-sheet. Shape with a spoon or 
plain tube and pastry bag. Bake in 
a moderate oven to a Ught brown color. 
It will take about ten minutes. For 
variety, before baking press a candied 
cherry or bit of citron into the top of 
each, or brush over the surface with 
cold water, and dredge with granulated 
sugar. For crescents take about two 
ounces of paste, and beat gradually into 
it about half of the preparation made 
for macaroons. Take a tablespoonful 
of this firmer mixture, and roll under 
the hand on a board dredged with 
powdered sugar to form crescents, 
then roll these in blanched almonds, 
chopped or sliced fine. Bake as 
macaroons. Remove from the paper 
with a spatula as soon as baked. 

Banbury Cakes; 

The following is an English recipe; 
the mince used for filling, called Ban- 
bury meat, may be kept covered in 
a jar and used when needed. Beat half 
a pound of butter to a cream. Add 
half a pound of lemon and orange peel, 
cut fine, one pound of currants, half an 
ounce of cinnamon, and two and a half 
ounces of allspice. Cut rich pastry 
into rounds or squares. Put a layer of 
Banbury meat on half the pieces of 
pastry. Brush the edges with cold 
water, and cover with the other pieces 



of pastry, pressing the edges close to- 
gether. Brush over the edge and top 
with frothed white of egg, and dredge 
with granulated sugar. Bake about 
fifteen minutes. Serve hot or cold. 
We recommend baking the pastry in 
the form of tart shells, then, when ready 
to serve, reheat the shells, and fill them 
with the Banbury mixture, cooked in a 
double boiler. The following mixture 
is one we have used many times. Chop 
fine one cup of stoned raisins and one- 
fourth a cup of citron or candied 
cherries. Add the grated rind and juice 
of a fresh lemon, one cup of sugar, and 
one egg, slightly beaten. Cook the 
mixture over hot water until slightly 
thickened. Use hot or cold.

York Ham, Sauce Madere 
Soak the ham in several waters. 
Scrub and cut off discolored parts, and 
put into a large pot with plenty of 
cold water. Add an onion, a carrot, and 
part of a bay leaf. Let the water heat 
very slowly to the boiling-point, skim, 
then let cook at the simmering-point 
until the ham is nearly tender. Take 
it up, drain carefully, and remove the 
skin, then set it in a deep baking-dish, 
the fat side uppermost. Have ready, 
made very hot, a bottle of Madeira 
wine, a pint of rich, high-seasoned stock, 
either white or brown, and half a cup of 



sugar. Pour the Uquid mixture over 
the ham, and set the dish into the oven. 
Let it cook, basting every ten minutes, 
until the liquid is reduced and the ham 
is glazed a rich brown color. Add the 
liquid in the pan to a brown sauce, 
and serve it with the ham. Buttered 
onions should be served also. 

Cream Celery Sauce 
Prepare the usual white sauce, cutting 
down the two tablespoonfuls of flour 
to one tablespoonful and a half, and 
use cream as the liquid. Finish with

BooJ^ Reviews 

Cassbll's New Dictionary of Cook- 
ery. Large 8vo. Price $5. New 
York: Cassell & Co. 
The practical part of this work is 
preceded by a complete treatise on the 
principles of cookery. This is an 
important and valuable feature of 
the book. The alphabet of the cook- 
ing art is comprised therein. Special 
notice is given here to marketing, the 
care and management of kitchen ranges, 
cooking by gas, table service and decora- 
tion, the storeroom and larder, in- 
valid cookery, chafing-dish cookery, 
etc. All these pages are replete with 
timely information and useful sug- 
gestion. Cooking is regarded as a 
very essential branch of practical edu- 
cation. 

The body of the book contiuns about 
ten thousand recipes with numerous 
illustrations and twenty colored plates. 
The recipes are arranged in dictionary 
form. Cross references have been in- 
serted, to the end that every article may 
be found without difficulty and at a 
moment's notice. 

The aim of the publishers, it is 
claimed, has been to make this the 
most complete and comprehensive work 
on household cookery ever published, and 
it is for the public to say how far they 
have succeeded in this object. Of 
course, the recipes are not new: many 
of them are old, English and Conti> 
nental in nature; but certainly cook, 
housekeeper, and student will find this 
volume a storehouse of useful in- 
formation, a manual of ready use and 
reference.

Tlie author says: "The principle un-

of newspaper or asbestos. 

"Use a pot without a handle as 
easier to pack. Put about three inches 
of hay in bottom of box, set in the 
kettle you intend to use, and pack hay 
around it to the top of kettle. Take 
out the kettle, put in whatever is to 
be cooked, let it come to a boil on 
range or gas stove, and boil hard a 
few minutes. Quickly clap on cover 
and place in Hay-box. Cover tight 
with muslin or cheese-cloth bag filled 
with hay — go to the club, go shopping, 
read, write, entertain yotu- friends, 
for the dinner needs no further atten- 
tion on your part." 

The book contains simple and valu- 
able recipes with directions for cook- 
ing in the hay-box. The results are 
said to be better than those obtained 
on the ordinary range. No article is 
likely to be over-cooked. 



Professor C. Lloyd Morgan, in his 
recent book, "The Interpretation of 
Nature," quotes from Professor SuUy 
the story of a little girl who stole 
softly into the dining-room, not notic- 
ing that her elder sister was standing 
at the book-shelf in a dark comer of 
the room. The little girl took a bunch 
of grapes from the fruit-dish, and tip- 
toed toward the door; but, before she 
reached it, she paused, then returned 
to the table, replaced the grapes, and 
left the room empty-handed, murmuring 
softly, "Sold again, Satan!" 



A rather critical old lady once said to 
Crawford, "Have you ever written any- 
thing, Mr. Crawford, that will live after 
you are gone?" "Madame," Crawford 
replied politely, "what I am trying to 
do is to write something that will 
enable me to live while I am here." —

A New

We have produced a range that we believe meets modem 
demands better than any heretofore made. We call it the 

B\LACE 

/rawford 

^^^^^F The old End Hearth — so often in the 
way — is omitted. There is more area in 
the top of the range, an end shelf at the left being added. *The 
ashes fall into a hod far below the grate, 
which makes their removed easier and 
more cleanly, and inakes the grate lait 
longer. The coal-hod is alongside the 
ash-hod, — out of the way.

Perfume Therapeutics 

(Continue from page 135.) 
an action upon the heart that one af- 
fected with disease of that organ should 
beware of inhaling this perfume for any 
length of time. 

While all parts of the plant of 
the lily -of- the -valley possess medicinal 
value, its virtues reside principally in 
the flower. Preparations of it taken 
internally have a marked action upon 
the heart and lungs. It should lie re- 
membered in this connection, however, 
that the perfume of lily-of-the-valley 
is rarely made from this plant, but is 
obtained by a combination of attar of 
almonds, 'vanilla, and extract of tube- 
rose. The various preparations bear- 
ing the name ' 'violet " are usually made 
from attar of almonds, as the genuine 
pure essence of violet is very costly. 

The Greek cosmetic perfumers were 
the first to use oils and ointments as 
carriages for their wares. 

Oil of cloves is a household remedy 
used to destroy sensation in the nerves 
of hollow teeth when aching, and it 
quickly relieves the pain. Even that 
unsightly disease, Lupus vulgaris, yields 
to the potent qualities of oil of cloves, 
the repeated application of which is 
said to cause separation of the epi- 
thelium and retrocession of the nod- 
ules. The virtues of oil of camphor 
are known to every householder. 

Various vegetable essences have been 
shown to possess marked antiseptic 
power. Essence of cinnamon has been 
utilized by M. Lucus-Championniere, 
a celebrated French physician, as a 
surgical dressing. The therapeutic 
action of myrrh on the gums causes 
it to be kept in the home medidne 
chest. Preparations of rose are 
somewhat astringent. Rose water is 
useful in superficial bums, chapped 
lips or hands, abrasions, and minor skin 
eruptions, such as prickly heat. 

Inasmuch as superstition character- 
ized the beliefs of the times when the 
worship of flowers predominated, ludi- 
crous legends are associated with many

gHE old way of baying w ._ „ . 
^ in bulk, wJtfaoiit koowing 
H whero they were m«de or by 
3 whom, is no longer pleasing 
to people who are at all fastidioiis. 
This is well shown by the rapidly in- 
creaaing demand for our widely known 
"Arlington SauMagt, " put Up in pound 



■ packages. 

AHInghn 



"Adlngfen Saiitagt" u^ made only 
from the choicest materialB and under 
strictly Mnitaiy conditions. Our sau- 
sage department is as clean and inviting 
as your own pantiy. Every pound of 
"Ailbiglen Sauiagt" ia double-wrapped 
in geim-proof parchment paper, plainly ' 
■narked with our name. 

This wrapping serves two purposes : 
i; identifies our sausage and prevents 
snbMitution by nnscrtipuloDs dealers j 
and it protects the sausage trom the 



germ-laden dust which la everywhere 
present in the air in public places. It 
also prevents handling. 

Qood dealers all over New England 
sell "Arlington Saaiage." Your dealer 
can get them just as easily as be can 
get bulk goods. If he is unable lo 
supply you, send us (1 and we will 
ship you, express paid within 500 miles 
o{ Boston, five one-pound packages of 
"Arlington Saiaagr" and ■ sample pail 
of Squire's Kettle-rendered Pure Leaf 
Lard. If this is more than you can 
use, some neighbor doubtless will be 
glad to take a part. 

We also make a very fine German 
Frankfort, which we put up in one- 
pound packages. You should insist 
upon getting the pork products made 
by us, BB our name is a guaiantee of

A lady stepped from the Limited 
Express at a side station on a special 
stop order. To the only man in sight 
she asked, — 

''When is the train for Madison due 
here, please?" 

* *The train went an hour ago, ma*am : 
the next one is to-morrow at eight 
o'clock." 

The lady in perplexity then asked, — 

"Where is the nearest hotel?" 

* 'There is no hotel here at all," re- 
plied the man. 

"But what shall I do?" asked the 
lady. •"Where shall I spend the 
night?" 

"I guess you'll have to stay all night 
with the station agent," was the reply. 

"Sir!" flashed up the lady, "I'd 
have you know I'm a lady" — 

"Well," said the man as he strode 
oflF, "so is the station agent!" 



Your attention is called to the adver- 
tisement of "Bell's Seasoning" on an- 
other page of this magazine. Here 
in New England your mother used this 
seasoning, and probably your grand- 
mother. For more than forty years it 
has been recognized as the seasoning 
for the "Thanksgiving Turkey." You 
can do no better than to use it for 
flavoring the dressing of turkey, 
chicken, meat, and fish. 



In addition to the purpose for which 
it is primarily designed, — ^to measure 
accurately liquids and solids, — ^few little 
utensils can serve so many uses as the 
"de Boutville Half Teaspoon." Any 
one who has filled salt and pepper 
shakers, spilling as much as was put in, 
will find this spoon worth the price 
for that purpose alone. And that is 
only one of many handy points about 
it.

Read what The FQgHm says of Mrs. Hill's New Book 

"The Up-to-date Waitress" 

Every waitress who reads "The Up-to-date Waitress" will 
be proud that she is one, and every girl who is not will wish 
to go into training at once, so successfully has Janet 
McKenzie Hill dignified that occupation. The clever 
editor of The Boston Cooking-School Magazine sends out in 
this book an invaluable guide to correct serving. It has 
in it something for every woman, whether she keeps no ser- 
vant, one servant, or a dozen, or is one herself. In fact, it 
is so 6lled with valuable and practical suggestions for every 
home that a study of it cannot but lead to increased dainti- 
ness and improved methods in every household. 

OUR OPRER. We will Mni postpaid, to any address, a copy of "The Up-to 
date Waitress " on receipt of price, I1.50; or to a present subscriber as a premium for 
sending us three (3) NEW yearly subscriptions to our magaiine at %\ each.

A well-known authority on boiuehold matters says: Window 
shades are all well enough ior utility but curtains are needed to 
give a room a really farnithtd air. ' * 

In other words, curtains are ornamental rather than useful. In 
order tlut they may serve the purpose for which they are Intended 
—"give a room a. really furnished air"— they must harmonize 
with the other furnishings In it; and they mast be cUan. 

That brings up the question : Howdoyoa wash your curtains? 

There are twenty wrong ways ; only one right way. 

The right way is easy. The wrong ways are hard ; hard on the 
curtains; doubly hard on the temper. 

This is the right way :

SAUSAGE that 
you can be sure of 

Good sausage properly cooked are delicious. Nearly 
every one agrees on tnat point But when you hay sausage 
in bulk you don't know that they are good. You don't 
know who made them, you don't know what's in them, you 
don't know who has handled them, and you do know that 
they have been exposed to die dust and microbe laden air 
of the market. But it is a simple matter to get rid of all 
this uncertainty. Insist on having 

Squire's ARLINGTON Sausage 

Made from choice, young, fresh pork and pure ^>ices, in 
the cleanest of clean workrooms, by careful, experienced 
people. Each pound double-wrapped in air and impure 
proof parchment paper, and plainly marked "Squire's 
Ariington Sausage." Never touched by any band from the 
time they leave our factory until they are opened in your 
kitchen. 

Any dealer can obtain Squire's "ArHngton" Sausage 
as easily as he can the ordinary bulk goods. If your dealer 
declines to suf^ly you, said us one dollar and we will de- 
Hver at your door, express paid within 500 miles of Boston, 
five one-pound packages of Squire's " Arlington" Sausage 
and a sample pui of Squire's Kettle-rendered Pure Leaf

you, get some ndghbor to take a part

The Dream Boats 



By Grace Stone Field 



The dream boats sail away at night, 
And the Lullaby Lady waves her hand ; 
Over the sea of sleep they sail, 
"Outward bound with a favoring gale" 
From the shores of Drowsy-land. 



The Lullaby Lady waits on shore 
As the boats push off the sand. 
The fare is a kiss, or maybe more ; 
And change she gives, from a generous store, 
To each of the mariner band. 



And always the Lullaby Lady waits 
Each voyager dear to greet, 
With welcome warm, to Morning-strand, 
As -sunrise breaks on Daytime-land; 
For mother's the Lady, you understand, 
• The Lullaby Lady sweet!

Salem Porches: A Study in Architecture

alize that without the massive, beau- ness of these structures.

iron gratings, the Boston Public Li- eral outlines or how severely plain the 
brary would look like a grim, gray architecture, there is always a showi- 
fortress? It is the doors of the cathe- ness about the doorwav that strikes

the eye first, even though it is merely 
that of contrasting simplicity. 

In our old homes we almost inva- 
riably find the Stamp of Puritanism, 
and a deeper scrutiny will reveal the 
characteristics of the times and the 
customs brought together in the door- 
way designs. There being no archi- 
tects in this country, joiners brought 
columns and pieces from the old coun- 
try, and found the widest scope for 
displaying their originality in fitting 
them together, in the doors and door- 
steps; but the carpenters, having 
learned their craft in England, worked 
out, perforce, the plans already learned, 
and the result was often a surprising 
mixture. 

Stroll through some of our New Eng- 
land villages, and make a study of the 



doorways of the homes. Possibly you 
may be disappointed at first, and, un- 
less you have already studied the sub- 
ject somewhat and are prejudiced in 
its favor, you may see doorways only 
as doorways, as necessary parts of a 
whole structure. But plod along, and 
keep your eyes open, and you will soon 
be lost in contemplation of the erst- 
while commonplace. 

See that scraggly old garden at the 
end of a dusty stretch of road! The 
fence is half gone, and the weeds are 
thickly interspersed with the old-fash- 
ioned flowers, — hollyhocks and dahlias, 
intermixed with sunflowers, — and the 
air is so redolent with sweet clover 
that it well-nigh suSocates you. In 
the old house, which is such a very 
old one, guiltless of paint, is the door-

way with its tiny panes of glass, white 
and conspicuous. 

Portsmouth has its old doorways, 
for it is full of quaint and interesting 
bouses. Most of these are still occu- 
pied by descendants of the original 
owners. ,The Ladd house, built in 
1760, shows a most imposing entrance 
in the Georgian style of architecture. 

Kittery, Me., shows the Sir William 
Pepperell house, built in 1739, and 
materially differing from the ordinary 
in the doorstep being raised from the 
ground. This gives an added impress- 
iveness to the mouth of the roomy 
mansion. 

The Longfellow house has an inter- 
esting doorway, modelled much after 
that of the Wyman tavern in Keene, 
N.H., where we find an example of 
the Norman use of polished columns, — 
the earliest use; for later on clusters 
of columns came into evidence, and 
later still sculptured figures was their 
adornment. 

One of the narrow streets in quaint 
old Marblehead shows a particularly 
splendid example of an old doorway. 
It looks ponderous and ill-propor- 



tioned at first glance, but a careful 
survey shows symmetrj" and purpose. 

Salem, the witch city, is particularly 
noted for its fine doorways, and archi- 
tects have come from far and near to 
copy them. Many of them are the 
entrances to houses built by the mer- 
ctuints of that famous old New Eng- 
land town, when the port was the door- 
way to the country for the spices and 
tea and the merchandise of the Orient, 
Sumatra, Calcutta, and Zanzibar, and 
the town was plethoric with the in- 
crement therefrom. They are said 
by those who have seen them to be 
types of the best that are to be found 
in New England architecture. At 
53 Charter Street stands a three-story 
wooden house, perhaps a century old, 
studded with a square front, standing 
right upon the street and cornered in. 
a graveyard, its small enclosed porch 
affording a ghmpse up and down the 
, street through an oval window on each 
side. Here lived Elizabeth Peabody,

Pierce- Nichola House 



who lifted the rough, hand- forged 
latch to admit Nathaniel Hawthorne 
and his sisters, — the commencement 
of a friendship that ended in a mar- 
riage. 

The Cabot- End icott doorway, No. 
365 Essex Street, forms the entrance 
to a pure colonial house, owned by Mr. 
Daniel Low. This house, built in 1748, 
was the birthplace of Mary Endicott, 
daughter of William C. Endicott. Sec- 
retary' of War in President Cleveland's 
Cabinet. It was here that in 1890 
General William T. Sherman was en- 
tertained. 

The Pierce- Nichols house, the porch 
of which is shown, was erected in 
1798, and is a fine specimen of the 
houses of that time of commercial 
prosperity. The Lyman . doorway, 
near the Common, as also the Meek 
doorway, while differing in architect- 



ure, are both fine specimens of Salem 
porches. 

Under the oddly car\'ed porch of 
the house 138 Federal Street, the street 
whose name has been carried from one 
end of the country to the other as the 
name of a tune, passed many daughters 
of Salem's merchants, grasping the 
silken folds of heavily flounced skirts 
as they mounted the steps and passed 
into the house. 

In the more elaborate arrangement 
known as the Bulfinch doors we have 
a construction that is at once simple 
and artistic. The doorways of the 
Portsmouth Athenxum and the Boston 
State House are like examples, both 
being built by Bulfinch himself. In 
the old doorways on Court Street, 
Portsmouth, and that of the Hazen 
house on Congress Street, we have il- 
lustrations of the progress made toward

elaboration ; and so one might go on 
indefinitely, finding in the rudest and 
most crude of our old houses some- 
thing of interest and something repre- 
sentative of the time in its doorways. 
Often, in the most out-of-the-way 
places, one happens upon lines and 
angles and curves which show how 
history and Puritan theology are often 
halt concealed, half revealed, in wood 
and brick and mortar. 



Doorways are an important feature 
of every structure. They should al- 
ways be made appropriate to the nature 
and purpose of the building into which 
they give entrance. Cheerful or gloomy 
in aspect, they either invite or forbid 
the approaching stranger. No part 
of a dwelling affords a better place than 
the doorway to display the character 
and taste of the owner. We build our- 
selves into our houses. 



A Chestnut Street Porch 



Minor Thanksgiving Reasons 



By Kate Gannett Wells 



AN official Thanksgiving prcKla- 
/\ mation always sounds like rhet- 
X jkL^ric compared with the ungram- 
matical, jerky, personal little outbursts 
of gratitude which crowd upon our 
jogging memories all the way along 
our days of half discontent. One day 
in the year set apart for Thanksgiving! 
Why? Three hundred and sixty-five 
days are not enough for thanks, not 
because life is especially joyous, but 
because it is not worse than it is ! Not ' 
a bit of humbug in saying that. It is 
sheer truthfulness, for the older we are, 
the more dominant becomes this one 
note of thanksgiving. No matter how 
bad things are, they might be worse, so 
let us give thanks. 

Oh, the blessings that lie in these 
minor causes for gratitude, which 
heaped together would outdo in their 
jubilant phrases any proclamation of 
President or Governor, for it is only 
average human nature to rejoice first 
over one's personal boons. National 
causes of gratitude are all good in their 
way, but they don't come home save 
to patriots with that throbbing, ex- 
ultant sense of victory as do one's 
own little successes and pleasant hap- 
penings. 

We are thankful because we have 
found out that * 'laughter is as divine 
as tears," and that we ought to be jolly 
and on good terms with all peoples and 
things. We need not go back to Saint 
Francis, nor read the up-to-date liter- 
ature of the Societies for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Children and Animals, to 
learn how to be friends with birds and 
horses and puny children, as now we 
see that it does not pay to mangle the 
life of anything, nor to bear grudges, 
nor to go about our daily doings with 
grievances, as if we were sorely in- 
jured. We are so glad we have dis- 



covered that it is not worth while to 
be on the lookout for trouble. 

Akin to gratitude for laughter is the 
thankfulness for having acquired the 
faculty of letting things pass, of not 
magnifying trifles, of knowing how to 
separate the transient from the per- 
manent, and, when the permanent is 
bad, of knowing how to get round it, 
so that its worst badness gets elimi- 
nated. Just to let things slide makes 
a vast difference in the ease of living. 
It is a real knack to acquire this meet- 
ing of trouble easily. Some people 
seem to think that others have feelings 
only when they take life seriously : that 
is an easy matter compared with taking 
it blithely. 

More downright still is the rejoicing 
for the ability to praise others, which 
puts one in a glow of reflected happi- 
ness. One feels so strong and respon- 
sive, so wide-awake and exuberant in 
praising another, it is like the stimulus 
of briskest exercise. Coupled with it 
is thankfulness for the right to love 
individuals, when we find it difficult or 
impossible to love humanity, which, as 
Chesterton has said, *'is like loving a 
gigantic centipede." All of us are not 
attracted by gregarious woes or bliss: 
we like things singly, it is the one 
friend in whom we rejoice. In these 
days, when we are constantly told that 
we ought to give ourselves to humanity, 
to intermunidpal or international work, 
to anjrthing which is inter and ex- 
tensive and binding, it is a relief to be 
simply thankful for the capacity to 
love and praise an individual for friend- 
ship's sake, and to leave humanity to 
those who appropriate it as a whole. 
Organizations and committees don't 
take the place of homes and chums. 
It is a great deal happier to marry a 
man than to be devoted to humanity. 



Minor Thanksgiving Reasons 



171 



One can take that when she has not 
the man. 

We are thankful also for the ability 
to see the romantic and beautiful in 
almost ever3rthing, for the right to build 
and live in dream castles, for the sweet- 
ness of carrying on a perpetual, imagi- 
nary love story, in which we are always 
happy heroines, even if we are elderly. 
The rest of the family need not know 
anything about our good times all by 
our solitary selves. We know about 
them, as we dream while we work, and 
our pale lips and dull eyes grow deeper 
in color over oiu* imaginings. Better 
still is it that our day-dreams help us 
to love what seems ugly in people and 
things, for in loving we transform the 
ugliness into beauty. Thanksgiving 
day is fine for this transformation. The 
dry tiu'key grows juicy, the pale cran- 
berry turns crimson, and the ansemic 
pumpkin pie takes on an orange hue. 

Still more personal is our thankful- 
ness for the knowledge how to keep 
young in looks, even if we have to use 
the appliances of age, the props that 
simulate youth. It is no longer a crime 
not to wear a cap nor to use cosmetics, 
nor to "keep one's figure." It is so 
silly not to do all that the science of 
the toilet makes practicable. 

Stronger yet than gratitude for ac- 
quiring the ability to preserve the out- 
ward semblance of youth is rejoicing 
for the permission of ourselves to for- 
ever try to keep young at heart. When 
you think you are too old to do a thing, 
then do it, says Dr. Lavender in Mrs. 
Deland's last story. It is so much easier 
to-day to be old in years than it was 
half a century ago, for now we keep 
up the bodily activities ^nd the mental 
resources, which once it was thought 
the part of resignation to relinquish, 
with the putting on of spectacles. 



Only old people should always be on 
the lookout, lest they grow abject in 
demeanor through the pressure upon 
them of the youth of others. Children 
are so much younger than parents, and 
they do offer such perpetual advice to 
be careful. Just let the aged show that 
they expect always to be of importance, 
and they will be. Let them get humble- 
minded, and they will fritter away so- 
cially and intellectually. 

Thankful, too, we well may be when 
we have learnt it is not necessary to 
always tell all we know. There are 
always a few enthusiasts who make it 
their business to insist upon the whole 
truth at all times, as if reserve were 
never wise nor diplomatic, and as if 
truth consisted in speech alone. Let 
us be thankful when we know how to 
be astute and not to say a word too 
much, not even informing ourselves of 
what we think. 

Surely we may be loudly thankful 
that the spelling reform has not yet 
invaded the Cooking-School Magazine, 
lest some of us might not imderstand 
its recipes in the garb of presidential 
authority, and then our home menus 
would be so much the poorer for our 
ignorance. 

Three reasons for minor thankfulness 
loom up big as we count our blessings : 

(i) That we have got the courage to 
put up with ourselves, just about the 
hardest thing we have to undertake, 
and that we have sympathy to put up 
with other people, which is not half so 
difficult a performance as enduring oiur- 
selves. (2) That we live to-day and 
were not alive at any other time. 

And last and best of these reasons 
for .gratitude is the fact that, when 
we " cannot do the best thing, we 
always have ability to do the next 
best thing. 



A Church Service in Dixie-land 



By Lee McCrae 



ct 



TEK de front seats! de front 
seats!" urged the usher at 
a negro church where my 
friends and I presented ourselves one 
summer evening. Although he was 
politeness itself, we persisted in sitting 
close to the open door in the rear. 

We had missed the first of the ser- 
vice, and just as we were seated they 
began taking up the collection, — lit- 
erally taking it up, for the givers 
marched to the front and deposited their 
offerings upon little tables that were 
ranged before the pulpit. These were 
three in number, one for pennies and 
nickels, one for dimes, and the third 
for "quatahs an' othah big money." 

We learned afterwards that the 
preacher is wont to say so much about 
**de cheap table" that few have the 
courage to patronize it, and the chtu'ch 
is prospering accordingly. 

In a lusty, high-keyed voice a good 
brother was singing "Laban" over and 
over, while the people crowded up and 
down the aisles, clattering their chairs 
upon the bare floor, some giggling, 
some chatting with friends, some sing- 
ing "Laban." Several made two or 
three trips, possibly for the sheer fun 
of it or to show their new clothes, or, 
perchance, to let their neighbors know 
they had more than one "piece ob 
money/' as they say. 

Naturally, we visitors thought our- 
selves excused; but not so. When a 
degree of quiet was restored, the 
preacher spied us, and exclaimed: "We 
begs de white folks' pahdon! Dey 
should hab been waited on fust! 
Bruddah Jackson, you tek de basket to 
dem. I spects dey wants ter gib a 
dollah apiece." 

There were no hymn-books in the 
seats, for various reasons, so the words 
were lined out, and sung in different 



keys and times according to the indi- 
vidual notions of the singers. How 
they did enjoy it! Even the prayers 
of the brethren took on a sort of tune, 
waxing more and more tuneful as their 
earnestness increased. 

Then the pastor arose and made the 
announcements, prefacing them with a 
proud statement that was evidently 
for our benefit: — 

**Dis yere am a live chu'ch! Deir 
am something goin' on ebery night. 
On Monday we preaches de Sinclair's 
baby's funeral; Tuesday night de 
Endeavahs gib a tacky pahty heah 
in de chu'ch; Wednesday night de 
prar-meetin' concurs; an' Friday 
night eberybody come to de pigtail 
sociable!" 

(Pigtails are considered choice mor- 
sels by the colored folks, but how they 
are served at sociables I cannot sav, 
as we did not accept the invitation.) 

"An' now, breddren," he continued, 
"we will hab a trial summon by yotmg 
Bruddah Allen. He jes' lamed ter 
read 'bout two yeahs ago, but he has 
long puspired fo' de ministry, an' you 
mus' gib him yo' 'tention." 

After an apologetic preamble which 
had been carefully prepared and com- 
mitted to memory, the perspirani 
took a text about Joshua, and began 
to wax eloquent over the crucifixion. 
The more agonizing he made it, the 
louder were the ' ' Amens " and ' 'Glorys " 
from the front seats. But in the midst 
of it self -consciousness suddenly mas- 
tered him, and he exclaimed, "Now 
doan' any ob you laugh, or I'll git 
sca'd an' quit! Reckon it's time ter 
quit anyhow!" 

So ended the trial, — well named. 
The parson arose quickly, and put this 
quietus upon criticism. 

"/ tink de bruddah done pretty 



"That Ramshackle"

good! Ef yo' hea'ts wuz prepahed, 
you got some good outen it: ef dey 
wuzn't, 'twarn't his fault." 

Then he gave out his text, and 
preached a really creditable sermon, 
but one so fraught with excitement 
that two "sistahs" danced and shouted 
in the aisle, and a third had to be car- 
ried into the open air to recover from 
her happiness. This seemed to sur- 
prise no one except the visitors. We 
were informed that women always 
'*took on," that no one is considered 
to have any religion unless he or she 
makes a fuss about it. 

At the close of the sermon the doors 
of the church were opened. One young 
negress went forward, and was seated 
in a chair facing the audience. The 
preacher announced her name and the 
fact that she brought a letter dated 
some five years before, and asked 
if any one would make a motion to 
receive her. 

Just as the motion was made, the 
tune-starter sprang to his feet with a 
loud ''lobjec'!" 

There was a thrilling silence. He 
wiped his glasses and then his whole 
head with a gorgeous handkerchief, and 
continued : — 

"De sistah habn't got much religion, 
er she'd hab j'ined de chu'ch when she 
fust came heah. An' de man what 



recommembered huh, mos' likely he's 
dead by now. Yes, I objec'!" 

Nevertheless, after some debate the 
motion was seconded, and the whole 
congregation, including the visitors, 
lustily voted in the dilatory ** sistah." 

By this time it was half-past ten 
o'clock, and the communion was still 
to be partaken. The interest was at 
high tide, and no one, not even the men 
who had stood against the wall through- 
out the long service, showed any signs 
of weariness. 

Amid intense silence the preacher 
lifted the piece of a sheet that covered 
the table, crumbled the pile of soda 
crackers on to porcelain dinner plates, 
and poured the wine from a tall beer 
bottle into some glass tumblers. 

Then the visitors reverently slipped 
out.

They cotdd scarcely have stayed 
that long in daytime unless they had 
worn blue glasses, for then the sun- 
light streams through small window 
panes that are painted alternately 
brick-red and grass-green in checker- 
board fashion. Common house paint 
was used, and it was put on with a 
whitewash brush; but, as one of the 
brethren let his dray stand idle while he 
thus beautified the chtu'ch, it was surely 
a "labor of love," and therefore a suc- 
cess in the eyes of the recording angel. 



^^That Ramshackle'' 

In Two Parts 
By Frances Campbell Sparhawk

OU told him, of course, Molly, 
that we couldn't do it," said 
Jack, as the tVo sat that even- 
ing in their pretty sitting-room. 

'*I certainly did." 

"And then you gave it up like a 




good girl, and came back here, which 
isn't the worst place in the world." 

"Yes, I gave up the five hundred 
dollar repairs, as you say. I told him 
we hadn't the money. When he saw 
how disappointed I was, he suggested 



174

that it wotild be easy to hire that 
amount. And I told him what Uncle 
Will used to say." 

''That debt wais the devil? You 
said that?" 

"Indeed, I did. He said he wished 
everybody felt so." 

**And then you came away, poor 
child!" 

"But not immediately." 

"What, Molly! You didn't try to 
beat him down?" 

"No, indeed! I only beat them 
down," 

"'Them'?" 

"Yes, the repairs. I told him that 
all he suggested, and more, we intended 
to have him do for us; but we must do 
it by degrees, and we could positively 
have only two hundred dollars' worth 
of repairs put on at present, and we 
counted upon him to make the house 
habitable for that. I said I could see 
how well he understood his business. 
This would have to be done, and he 
was the very man to do it." 

"So he took the praise in lieu of 
the three hundred dollars?" teased 
Jack. 

"Perhaps. He took to his figures 
again, and I stood with my fate trem- 
bling in the balance. I needn't have 
hard-wood floors at all, though they 
were better, he remarked after a while. 
We could put those in any time. It 
wasn't necessary to rip up all the floors 
now. He had thought I wanted new 
ones; but some were pretty fair, and 
the others could get on witii patching 
for the present. Most of the old blinds 
could be fixed up and made to do for 
a year or two. We could not cut on 
plastering, the ceilings were so bad, 
and the walls must be mended in many 
places. Then he supposed I wouldn't 
like to live in a house with patched 
walls,'^so, we should have to paper. 
As to the roof, he would look it over 
again very carefully. He thought 
he could manage^to keep onjj'a part 
of the shingUng, with patching; but 



some must be new. And there 
were other things that could not be 
skipped!" 

"So you are really going to throw 
two hundred dollars into the fire — or 
the same thing, into the house! You 
can't make it fit to live in, even in 
summer weather, for that." Molly's 
only answer was to shut her lips and 
smile. "And the work is to begin 
to-morrow morning?" he went on. 
"I thought you were anxious to be on 
hand then." 

"I am. But the early train will 
take me there. I'll come back at 
night. And Saturday, at the end of 
oiu" week here, you know, the furniture 
starts by freight. By the time it gets 
there, Mr. Harding says, the plastering 
will be dry enough to put the fiuniture 
into the house." 

"Hm! That depends a good deal 
on the weather." 

"Yes. And somewhat on a good 
kitchen stove that I found second- 
hand." 

"So, Molly, you want to leave here 
Saturday? I suppose from then, 
until we get our few sticks in the house, 
we shall be expected to hang like 
Mahomet's coffin between heaven and 
earth?" 

"I hope you'll like it," she laughed, 
and the next moment added: "O 
Jack, Mrs. Harding has the loveUest 
little boy, five years old. We have 
delightful games together." 

"When, pray? Is he one of the 
workmen?" 

' 'When I take my dinner at her house, 
— dinner in the middle of the day. I 
like it in the country." 

"So that's the bridge that's to carry 
us across the gulf of homelessness?" 
he said. 

She nodded assent. 

It was the following evening, when 
she had rettuned in time to go to a 
dinner party, that her husband asked: 
"Where's that new gown you were to 



"That Ramshackle" 



175 



wear, Molly? I think I've seen this 
one before — several times." 

**It's clean, — ^it's fresh, Jack; and 
you told me it was becoming." 

"Everything you put on is becoming, 
for that matter. But, if I remember 
that you've worn a thing over and 
over, other people are sure to remember 
it. Where's the new gown you were to 
have?" he persisted. "Isn't it fin- 
ished, with all the time you've spent 
on that ramshackle?" 

"No, Jack, it's not finished. And, 
to be quite honest, it's not begun. 
Did you expect me to fiunish a house 
out of the fumittire of sitting-room and 
bedroom?" 

A pause. Then Baring said in a 
displeased tone, "So my wife is to 
turn dowdy?" 

"Wait tiU you see the light in my 
eyes and the color in my ch«eks that 
the country air will give me!" she 
cried. "You won't call me 'a dowdy' 
then, even if I go ^bout in a kimono," 
finished dainty Molly with a glance 
which awoke her husband's smile. . 

That evening, with her happy face 
and her charming manners. Jack con- 
fessed to himself that he could find no 
fault with her. 

It was ten days later that Baring 
swung to the gate, — on its hinges now, 
— ^and walked up the path to his new 
possessions. < 

"Now the fiUTiiture is all scattered 
about, and things are not half finished," 
explained Molly. "But, at least, we 
can sleep here," she went on; "and 
to-morrow I'll get up something for 
your breakfast at home. Jack, before 
you go into town. And, O Jack, 
please don't think me avaricious; but 
I want you to pay me exactly what 
you paid in town for our board, taking 
out your fares, and pay me every 
week, — on the day, as you did there. 
I'm going to keep house on it!" 

"And hire a maid? Ridiculous, 
MoBy!" 



"'Ridiculous' then, but I'm going 
to try it." 

"I suppose you'd like board in ad- 
vance, you calcidating housekeeper," 
he laughed, handing her the amotmt. 

She dimpled and courtesied. * ' Thank 
ye kindly, sir. Fresh eggs for break- 
fast?" 

"Then your hens are la)ang well, 
Mrs. Baring?" 

"Enough for family use. Soon I'll 
get enough for their keep: most of 
that they now get out of the orchard. 
But we'll have the henyard built this 
autumn." 

"Out of the board money, I sup- 
pose?" 

She laughed, and kept her own 
counsel. "There are no rugs down 
until the house is papered," she said, 
"and that can't be until the plaster 
is thoroughly dry. But come into the 
dining-room. The open fireplaces in 
the hpuse — six, and good ones — are 
a blessing." She pointed to the hearth 
on which pine boughs had been piled 
to give it a festive look. "And see 
here. Jack." She approached mys- 
teriously a good-sized dining-table on 
which the cloth swept quite to the floor. 
As she lifted the cloth, she looked 
into her companion's face. 

"Ha! ha! a deal table! Why is 
your table-cloth like charity, Molly? 
And, methinks, I've seen these two 
chairs in otir sitting-room." 

"Patience, Jack. It takes time for 
little Romes, as well as the big one." 

They went out into the kitchen, 
where Molly showed a pump of rain 
water beside the sink. In the closet 
and the pantry were a few dishes and 
some cooking utensils of the newest. 
A neat young woman stood at the 
table making biscuit. "Tea at night 
in country fashion, at least at present," 
announced Mrs. Baring. "Hannah, 
this is Mr. Baring. Jack, you've not 
seen our little maid before, I believe." 

Baring, who had the good fortune 
to be a gentleman, greeted his servant 



176 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



as politely as if she had been a guest, 
and questioned her as to whether her 
home was in C, before he gave his 
attention to the cooking-stove, and 
remarked that something good must be 
in the oven. 

"Peep," Molly said, and disclosed 
one of his favorite dishes. 

They had learned that the trolley 
line, which at first had seemed of no use 
to them, ran within half a mile of the 
house, and would land Baring at the 
station every morning in time for his 
train. He was disposed to be a little 
cross at first over this half-mile walk; 
but Molly joked so hopefully about the 
healthful effect of his morning stroll, 
and was herself so indefatigable, that 
he was ashamed to grumble. 

Then the spirit of possession got hold 
of him. He laughed with a zest that 
was not all joking over their being 
landed proprietors. 

"Everything will be fairly convenient 
when we get into order," said the 
young wife, "except one thing. I 
don't like the drinking water outside. 
We must bring it into the house with 
a windmill." 

Baring roared. * * Pray, go on, Molly ! 
Did you ever happen to ask the price ? " 

"All the same, we'll have it some 
day." 

Within a month Baring was called 
away on business, to be absent a week. 
When he returned, he gazed about him 
in delighted astonishment. 

"We've only been papering," said 
Molly, meekly, watching him with 
secret delight. 

"Now, my dear, I've thought you a 
model of prudence before," he said, as 
he went from room to room, making 
his comments. "But you saved up 
elsewhere, to spend here. The effect 
is beautiful. That soft, warm gray 
tint in the drawing-room is simply 
exquisite. It brings out the pictures 
marvellously. And the faint yellowish 
tint in the Hbrary suggesting, but not 
emphasizing sunshine, is so well fitted 



to a room that the sun visits sparingly. 
It will make the bindings of the books, 
when we furnish this room, warmer 
and brighter. And just that suspicion 
of red in the dining-room! And the 
nondescript hue of the hall paper, — 
delidously soft and charming! You 
have succeeded admirably. I couldn't 
have believed that papering cotild so 
transform a house. But you must have 
dipped deep into your purse, Molly." 

She stood by silent until he addressed 
her. Then she answered, meeker than 
ever Moses was, "Do you think five 
cents a roll too dear, Jack?" 

He laughed. 

"This is all five-cents-a-roU paper — 
turned wrong-side out," she explained. 
"To be sure, I took some trouble in 
choosing it. The shades are up now, 
and the ctutains in the drawing-room. 
These are one of my bargains. We can 
get on well this summer. Jack, with 
kitchen, dining-room, hall, drawing- 
room, and bedroom. We must leave 
the furnishing of the rest of the house 
to a convenient season." 

"This carpet is mighty pretty, and 
shows off the rugs finely," interrupted 
Baring, who had been commenting on 
the effective way she had hung the 
pictiu^s. 

"Only a denim border for the big 
rug. It is effective." 

Jack had grown thoroughly inter- 
ested. He, too, began to save. One 
day he paid Molly double board. 
"You'll know what to do with it," 
he said. And she did. This he re- 
peated many times. 

Then a friend who was going abroad 
wanted to know what she should do 
with her cow — a fine one — ^for the 
summer, and, hearing that the Barings 
had a country place, suggested send- 
ing it there tmtil her return. "Our 
own eggs, our own milk, oiu* own 
butter, vegetables from oiu- neighbor 
for next to nothing but the pulling! 
I'm saving on your board, sir!" cried 
the young housewife. 



"That Ramshackle" 



177 



It was the end of September. Jack 
and Molly had been four months in 
their new home, when a friend invited 
herself to make them a visit. "She 
is used to everything in fine hotels 
and boarding-houses, for she is always 
travelling," objected Jack. 

"Very well, she shall have every- 
thing here, — everything comfortable, 
and a welcome, Jack. I think she 
can stand it for a few days." 

"Don't you want extra help?" 

"No, thank you. She comes *to see 
how we Uve,' she sa)rs. I^t her see." 

By this time the library had a carpet, 
curtains, a case of good books, and 
some little fiuniture; and the guest- 
room with its window opening upon the 
lawn, and looking down the winding 
road to the pine woods beyond, was 
most attractive. Also, many stray 
pieces of furniture, unpromising in 
the second-hand stores, had put on a 
new aspect under Molly's manipula- 
tions, with sometimes a little aid from 
the carpenter, and were admirably 
adapted to the quaintness of the house. 
In other cases unsightliness had been 
draped into beauty. 

Mrs. Oliver was enchanted. She had 
so much money that she never imagined 
that things could be bought as Molly 
bought them; and, if she had, she 
would have been infinitely amused, and 
have thought it great fun. The first 
day of her visit she praised unstintedly 
the views, the trees, the quaint charm- 
ing old fumittu'e restored to fit the old 
house. Such harmony! Such color- 
ing everywhere! The second day she 
said much less — naturally. Jack de- 
clared. The third day she was un- 
usually silent — ^for nature had made her 
a talker — and went over the whole 
place with her hostess, studjring the 
views. "There's something working 
in her mind-like," said Molly that 
evening to her husband. 
The fourth day it came out. Mrs. 



Oliver asked if they woidd not like to 
sell the place. 

Molly burst into tears. 

"Oh, no, no, thank you ever so 
much," Jack hastened to say. 

"But I'll tell you what, Mrs. Oliver," 
cried Molly, who had instantly recov- 
ered her dimples. "We'll put you up 
a bungalow on that knoll where you 
like the view so well, and furnish it 
for you, and let it to you for the sum- 
mers." 

"A bungalow!" repeated Mrs. Oliver. 
"But will that be big enough?" 

"Yes, my dear," cried Molly. 
"We're- living in healthful country 
quiet. You mustn't come down here 
and bring all your frills. You've no 
idea how lovely you are without them, 
and how restfid it will be to you. You 
know, you've only yoiu-self and Laura. 
Bring one maid, and a cook if you 
must, and picnic. If you want a 
horse, there is room in oiu" stable." 

"Just look at Molly, Mrs. Oliver. 
Did you ever see her so well? Coun- 
try air and country cream and country 
climbing and country hours would do 
more for Latu-a than all the massage 
in the world." 

"Are you in earnest, good people? 
Will you do it?" cried the guest, 
sitting bolt upright, and looking from 
one to the other. 

"We'll have a drive to Bolton Lake 
this evening to bind the bargain," 
laughed Molly. 

"How about getting into debt, 
Molly?" questioned Jack, when they 
were alone. 

"Mr. Harding and I can put up a 
bungalow for very little. Jack, with 
some of those charming plans to study. 
I can do it as well as Nannie Trumbull, 
I know. And then. Jack, there's 
that money you earned in your last 
case lying in the bank, waiting for a 
good investment. Here is one, and a 
charming neighbor besides." 



Browning in the Kitchen 

By Mrs. Charles Norman 



ROBERT BROWNING did not 
go into the kitchen as cook, but 
as the cook's assistant. His 
duty was to remain quietly upon a 
shelf erected for him just above the 
kitchen table, and, when the housewife 
had some particularly irksome task, — 
such as peeling potatoes, — she made 
ready, opened her volume of poems at 
some familiar Unes, and read them or 
thought them as she did her work. 

She was a lover of good literature, 
but her daily programme provided, no 
place for study. Her life was one of 
activity, not of contemplation. The 
young man who wooed her, ten years 
before, had not held out the promise: 

"If you'll be mine, 
Vou shall neither wash dishes nor yet serve 

the wine, 
But sit on a cushion and sew up a seam. 
And feast upon strawberries, sugar, and 



cream. 



>f 



He had told her frankly that he had 
no fortune. They had talked it over, 
and had decided that, while much of 
their time would have to be spent in 
earning a livelihood and in the con- 
sideration of sumptuary matters, they 
mtist not employ all their hours thus. 
They would reduce their wants, and 
manage the necessary labor so that some 
time would remain for intellectual and 
spiritual growth. With money it would 
be easy enough to get the refining in- 
fluences of art, music, and literature, 
but these advantages must be had 
without money. ** There is no use 
having a head," said the wife, "if we 
cannot contrive to live on little money." 
So much for theory I What of the 
practice? It must be admitted that 
not a day passed in which the whole 
palace of Beauty that their imagina- 
tions had built was not threatened 
with complete destruction. They had 
truly no gift for turning things into 



dollars. Their united ability was no 
better, in this respect, than their sep- 
arate powers. They could not neglect 
everjrthing while they read poetry, 
and the leisure their sotds longed for was 
always in the future. Work! work! 
work! Work was alwa3rs abundant. 
Every day brought not only its regular 
duties, but something special, till there 
was hardly time to look at a beautiful 
sunset. Sometimes an inspiration 
would come to them, — a vision of love- 
liness, — but it was instantly hidden by a 
mountain of labor. 

It soon became obvious that, if these 
worshippers of the ideals were to save 
themselves from the commonplace, 
they must do so by prodigious invention 
and courage; and it required but a 
brief analysis of the wife's case to 
decide where her time went. With all 
her determination to start right, she 
had started wrong. Some of the thou- 
sand little things that took a thou- 
sand minutes to do she could a£ford 
to slight. A few of them her small 
daughter could be trained to perform. 

There were several points about the 
home arrangements that could be 
altered advantageously. First, the 
floors must be judiciously covered. 
Turkish rugs, with all their beauty, 
had added no blessedness to this 
woman's life, for, besides the first cost, 
she found that they must be handled 
with some care, and could not be beaten 
by Tom, Dick, and Harry. Now 
Tom, Dick, and Harry were her only 
servants. She could not afford to 
pay for skilled labor, and she could not 
wear her life away fretting over the 
inefficiency of servants. 

Another menace to her liberty was 
a meaningless lot of bric-jL-brac. A 
few pieces should be kept for their 
own sakes, a few as mementos. 
Some were baubles and not worth a 



Browning in the Kitchen

daily dusting. Sewing and mending 
could be greatly reduced by bu)dng 
stout material and making garments 
plain. '*The most refined people do 
not dress their children nor themselves 
in fanciful clothes." That much the 
mother had learned, and she had found 
a certain blue and white homespun, 
of a certain brand, in a certain store, 
which was worth all it cost, and this 
was bought in quantities. Thus time 
was saved in selecting materials, time 
was saved sewing and mending, and 
money was saved, which would buy 
leisure. 

But there was the cooking. What 
could be done there? Already the 
fare was simple. In nourishing quali- 
ties it must not deteriorate. In vain 
the woman said to herself, *'Man shall 
not live by bread alone." Bread or a 
substitute he must have, and something 
else also. A healthy man and growing 
children cannot live upon beauty, even 
if **the beautiful is as useful as the use- 
ful." 

One day, when she was puzzling over 
these matters, a neighbor came in, — 
an old friendly acquaintance, — and the 
subject was broached to her. The 
answer was a flippant recital of the 
hackneyed lines: — 



<( 



We may live without poetry, music, and art, 
We may live without conscience and live 

without heart, 
We may live without friends and live without 

books, 
But civilized man cannot live without 

cooks." 



The anxious housewife was a bit 
irritated. "That stanza has not a 
word of truth in it," she said, endeavor- 
ing to be as polite as possible. **We 
cannot live, in any true sense, without 
poetry, music, art, friends, and books, 
still less without conscience and heart. 
Besides, it is quite possible to Uve 
without any cooking at all; and some 
people would better cook nothing than 
to cook in such an unhygienic manner 
as they do. We shotild learn tem- 



perance, — temperance in cooking and 
eating and in reading. Some persons 
cook so badly because they cook too 
much. They do *too much stewing,' 
as my husband says." 

"And too much roasting," said her 
sprightly neighbor, who relished a 
Uttle slang. 

"Yes, doubtless," answered the 
earnest wife. "But I am too serious 
to appreciate your jokes. I must do 
the things that are most important. 
I do not want to die, and have the 
children in after life sum up my 
virtues by saying, 'She made good 
doughnuts.'" 

"Well," said the neighbor, still jest- 
ing, "why don't you keep a volume 
of poetry beside you in the kitchen, or 
hang it around your neck and read as 
you walk about?" 

"Really," said the book-lover, "your 
idea is not so bad." And she afterward 
found that, with certain modifications, 
it was very good. It is sometimes 
necessary for a woman to put her entire 
thought into her cooking, but there 
are various bits of kitchen work that 
require Uttle attention. A woman's 
mind is never a vacuum, and she might 
as well think a lofty thought as a com- 
monplace one. She need not read, but 
simply glance at some lines already 
familiar and beloved. Thus the words 
and the thought might sink deep in her 
mind, as the kneading of the bread 
or some other bit of work went on. 
"For really," she thought, "there can 
be no possible necessity of having my 
brain in dish-water because my hands 
must be there." 

Sometimes, instead of a book, she 
had a picture or only a few lines before 
her. These were selected in the even- 
ing, and were intended to supply help 
where help was needed. Once, when 
she was a little discouraged with the 
cold winter, which was inclined to limp 
tediously away, there appeared upon 
the shelf these words : — 

"For, lo, the winter is past, the rain 



i8o 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



is over and gone ; the flowers appear on 
the earth; the time of the singing of 
birds is come." 

It happened sometimes that by the 
close of the day she was too tired to 
look at her verses. Sometimes she 
was fretted, and would not have read 
a line if she could. Generally, however, 
the very presence of her shelf-visitor 
was an inspiration, and in her weariest 
moments a sweet thought would often 



steal ^across her mind, like "perfume 
from'an unseen censer." 

Gradually, patience, reason, and 
thrift overcame many difficulties. 
The husband, by like efforts, had laid 
aside a little money without giving 
up body and soul to business; and so, 
in spite of the malevolent prediction 
of a certain peppery old lady, they 
had read Browning without letting 
* 'everything go to rack and ruin." 



What the Sexton^s Wife Thought about It 

By Helen Campbell 



IT was not in the least surprising 
that the minister had gone to sleep, 
for it was late afternoon of one of 
the busiest days the great ** Institu- 
tional Church," with its unceasing 
activities, had ever known. The big 
parlors, the perfect kitchen from which 
church suppers were served, the little 
theatre, and a series of committee and 
other rooms, each with its own special 
significance, made a whole in which 
from smallest baby in the criche up to 
the tramp in the little one known as 
"The Tramp's Retreat," all were pro- 
vided for as far as human foresight 
could provide. The minister, too, had 
a refuge, nominally a study, though ac- 
tually consulting-room most of the 
time, high up in the big, square tower, 
and perfectly appointed, — a haven of 
rest, at least to appearance, in its grave 
yet clear coloring, its long lines of book- 
cases, the great desk, a few fine prints, 
and a bust or two, and, the glory of it 
all, the two deep windows looking 
south and west. Under one the wide, 
leather-covered couch was set, and from 
it he could look out to the river running 
"at its own sweet will," the hills be- 
yond it green and still in the June sim- 
shine. 

All day he and the heads of innumer- 
able committees had planned the stun- 



mer work, for this was a church that 
never closed. There had been minutes 
in the long hot hours in which the 
overworked minister could have wished 
it might, and now, as he threw himself 
on the big lounge, he said half aloud, — 

"How would it feel, I wonder, to be 
a Chtu-ch of England rector, with half 
a dozen curates for all this miscellane- 
ous work, and a chance for a little living 
on my own account now and then?" 

And now there rose before him the 
vision of a great minster, the essence 
of beauty and of repose in every line 
and a brooding peace for all who en- 
tered there, and, even as it seemed to 
stand there fair and still before his 
tired eyes, they closed, and he slept 
suddenly and dreamlessly. 

Had it been minutes or hours? He 
could not have told, for he had waked 
as suddenly, yet quietly and refreshed, 
then sat up, for a high voice in the ad- 
joining committee-room was talking at 
its highest. 

"Why don't I tell the minister? 
I guess he's got enough on his mind, 
folks after him from morning till night, 
and he never seeming to think his soul's 
his own. I ain't on that plan. He's 
gone home, poor man, fit to drop, I 
shouldn't wonder, and Thomas was too 
busy to do the shutting up, so I come

up. I do mostly, though it wasn't in 
the bargain. Not much. You're a 
janitor's wife, and think there ain't 
any trials to beat that. What's the 
matter with our trials? I tell you, if 
you was a chtirch sexton's wife, — a 
church anyway that tries to run all 
creation, — you'd think you had a pretty 
soft snap. Now you just listen, and I'll 
tell you." 

The minister sat up, and ran his hands 
through his hair. This must not go on, 
but it was going on, and he found him- 
self listening intently. 

**Now I've seen quite a few sextons' 
wives," the high voice continued, "in 
big churches, too, not one of them, 
though, driven the way I am, and noth- 
ing to show for it but bank accoimt 
going down steady and temper rising 
to match. You ain't sniffing, I hope, 
for I had a bank accotmt, ma'am, 
when Thomas come along. He's my 
second, and before him I'd took up 
dressmaking again that I dropped when 
I married my first. I'm handy at it, 
and always was, and I had built up a 
first-rate little business, and three girls 
steady in my work-room. Then come 
the offer to him of this place as sexton, — 
fifty dollars a month and six living 
rooms and electric light free and gas 
for the stove and all. The big front 
room took me. It was just the place 
for my sewing, and I said we'd move. 
You better believe I wish I hadn't; for 
what do you think? It wasn't long 
before they called my second up before 
the church officers. It didn't start 
with them, let me tell you. It was 
that everlasting interfering old thing, 
Mrs. Deacon B., for I won't be took up 
for saying who, and then said it wasn't 
suitable to have a regular dressmaking 
establishment in the chtu-ch rooms, and 
the Sewing Society ladies and all the 
heads of everjrthing coiddri't stand it 
to know my customers was trailing up 
and down the stairs. 

**I was ready to fight them aU, but 
there ! My second was under contract. 



and there wa'n't nothing in it about me 
or my work, so I had to let my girls go, 
and do such sewing as I could alone, 
for I did want to keep some of my old 
customers. I might have taken a room 
or two somewheres else ; but look at it ! 
Here I have to show up at every chiu"ch 
social, not for fun, — no, ma'am, not 
much, — but to make coffee, and rinse 
cups, and dish ice-creams, and wishing 
it might choke some of them; for what 
do you think? First they borrowed 
my best vase that a customer give me 
for a wedding present, and they broke 
it that same night. Then they wanted 
my lemonade set, and another time all 
my best tumblers, and they broke most 
of them, and never. a word about re- 
placing them, and, when I said they 
shotddn't have my tea plates that they 
came after, they said I 'ought to be 
willing to do my part in the Lord's 
work,' and I said I guessed the Lord 
liked square dealing even at a church 
social, and when I got pay in cash or 
in kind for the things they had smashed 
would be time enough for me to settle 
what I'd do next. 

* 'That's one thing. Then once a 
week, all winter, they've had a rummage 
sale in the club-rooms, and the young 
woman that said she'd take sole charge 
caught the motoring fever bad, and 
hasn't come but three times since she 
started. So there's another job for me. 
What with suppers and teas and lect- 
ures, drills and mothers' meetings, I 
tell you there ain't even time to get 
Thomas a proper meal, much less eat 
one myself, and I'm that dyspeptic 
that the chiu-ch ought to pay the doc- 
tor's bill if it knew its business, which 
it don't. So this very day I have said 
to Thomas that, if he thought so much 
of being a sexton, I'd be obliged if he'd 
take a church where the sexton's family 
lives a mile away, and the ladies of the 
Sewing Society or Ladies' Aid or noth- 
ing else don't care whether he's married 
or single. He was kind of took aback, 
but he see the p'int because he was 



l82

in favor of my having a business of my 
own, and he's going to resign short off. 
Now maybe you'd like to see the study." 
The minister closed his eyes. There 
was no time for escape, and he sank 
back on the broad lotmge, and lay mo- 



tionless. ' ' Merciful man ! ' ' the sexton's 
wife cried, in a stifled voice, then fled. 
**To think he might have heard it every 
word," she said, as they descended the 
stairs, "but he was sleeping as peaceful, 
dear man. I hope it will do him good." 



Rhubarb in Winter and 
A New Way of Canning 

By C. B. Smith 



RHUBARB can be easily forced 
in the cellar for winter use. 
Prom a single good plant a 
dozen bunches of rhubarb of unsur- 
passed quality can be grown. It is 
easily possible to secure twenty dollars' 
worth of stalks on an area ten feet 
square. Not only, therefore, may the 
housewife grow her own rhubarb from 
January to April, but with a little addi- 
tional work she can make it a source of 
income as well. No special building or 
construction is required in which to 
grow rhubarb. All the heat needed can 
be supplied by a lantern, and the process 
of culture is so simple that good results 
can be obtained the first time trying. 

Most well-ordered suburban gardens 
and all farm gardens contain a few 
rhubarb plants. If some of these plants 
are dug up in November or December 
and left on the ground to freeze thor- 
oughly, they may be used immediately 
thereafter for forcing in the cellar or 
in boxes or in any frost-proof room. 

The roots should be packed in closely 
together, and covered about three inches 
deep with moist sand. It doesn't make 
any difference whether the floor of the 
cellar is cement, wood, or dirt. The 
roots do not grow, simply the stalks. 
The roots have already been stored full 
of plant food during the preceding 
summer's growth, and it is this stored 
food that the plant draws on in pro- 
ducing the new stalks. 



After the roots have been put in 
place, they should be entirely screened 
from the daylight. The stalks are more 
tender, juicy, better flavored, and more 
beautifully colored if grown in the en- 
tire absence of daylight. If a single 
ray of daylight penetrates the growing- 
room continuously, all the stalks bend 
toward it, becoming crooked, the leaf 
blade develops at the expense of the 
stalks, and the quality of the product 
is much impaired. 

Rhubarb will grow at a temperature 
anywhere above 45® Fahr. The higher 
the temperature, the faster will the 
growth be, but the stalks produced are 
not of as good quality as those more 
slowly grown. If a comer of the cellar 
is used for forcing, it may be screened 
from the light with blankets, and, if 
the growth is too slow, it may be hast- 
ened by keeping a lighted lantern in 
the bed. This gives heat, and does not 
have the injurious influence of day- 
light. 

Plants put in the cellar in December 
will usually be producing stalks by 
February, and will continue in bearing 
six weeks or more. When the yield of 
stalks begins to decline, the roots should 
be removed. These exhausted roots 
should be planted out in the garden 
again as soon as the soil can be worked 
in spring, and in a couple of years will 
be ready for forcing a second time. 

If one has only a few plants in the 



A New Way of Canning 



183 



garden, these may be split into halves 
or quarters with a spade, and only a 
part of the plant taken for forcing. 
This does not injure the part that re- 
mains, but is rather a benefit, since, 
unless thus divided, the crown becomes 
so full of buds that only weak, spindling 
stalks are produced. The cutting up of 
the clump reduces the number of buds 
and increases the size of the stalks. 
Roots two or three years old generally 
give best results, in winter forcing. 

There need be no hesitancy whatever 
in attempting to grow rhubarb for win- 
ter use. The only necessary precau- 
tions are to use only roots that have 
been frozen, and to grow the stalks in 
darkness. There is a lot of satisfaction 
in gathering and using rhubarb grown 
in one's own cellar, while the ground is 
still frozen and deeply covered with 
snow, and^the expense and trouble of 
doing it are so little that no one need 
be without this piquant tonic and relish 
in midwinter. 

The usual way of canning most com- 
mon fruits and vegetables is to heat 
them to the boiling point before putting 
them into cans. This high temperature 
kills most of the injurious micro-organ- 
isms which ordinarily cause fruit to 
mould and ferment. The cooking, how- 
ever, restdts in discolored, rather soft, 
and even mushy fruit. 

A new way has been discovered by 
which fruits can be canned without 
boiling. By this method the fruits re- 
tain . their natural shape, color, and 
flavor, and remain plump and attrac- 
tive in appearance. It is called the 
intermittent Pasteurizing method. 

By this method clean fruit or vege- 
tables are placed in clean cans, and 
water that has been boiled to sterilize 
it is poured over it, completely filling 
the cans. The covers are then put on 
lightly, but not screwed down, after 
which the cans are set in a boiler of 
water up to the cover. The water in 
the boiler is then heated up until the 



temperatiu*e in the centre of the cans 
records 165° Fahr. This is 57° less 
than boiHng-point. The cans are held 
at this temperature for fifteen minutes. 
They are then removed, and the tops 
screwed down firmly. After standing 
from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, 
the cans are again heated up to the same 
temperature for the same length of 
time. A day or two later they are 
heated up for the third time, after 
which the contents of the cans are 
sterile, and will keep perfectly. 

The principles involved in this 
method of canning are as follows : The 
fermentation and moulds on canned 
goods are caused by the growth in the 
fruit and juice of microscopic plants. 
These plants are propagated by spores 
which correspond to the seed of higher 
plants. These spores are produced by 
the million. They are blown about by 
the wind, and are everywhere present, 
being especially abundant on the fruit 
itself. 

With moisture and a sunmier tem- 
perature, these spores grow very rap- 
idly, resulting in fermented and putre- 
factive products. By heating them up 
to a temperature of 165° Fahr., every 
spore that has started to grow will 
be killed. The spores that have not 
started to grow will not be killed by 
the first heating, but by waiting twenty- 
four to forty-eight hotu^ almost all will 
germinate. The second heating kills 
all these, and, if any spores are still left, 
they germinate and are killed by the 
third heating. Fruits and vegetables 
thus sterilized in the cans keep prac- 
tically in their natural condition, and 
represent the perfection of canned 
goods. 

Com and peas cannot be preserved 
successfully by this method, but all of 
the fruits and such vegetables as to- 
matoes, green beans, wax beans, cauli- 
flower, asparagus, rhubarb, etc., when 
thus treated, keep perfectly, retain- 
ing their natural color, flavor, and 
texture.

STAND-PAT 

STAND-PAT is evidently a mod- 
em slang word. Yet, like Charles 
Suniner-s message of a single 
word, "stick," to Lincoln at a period 
of crisis in our national affairs, it is 
significant in meaning. The term in- 
dicates an attitude in, conduct that at 
certain times and exigencies is com- 
mendable enough, perhaps; but, as 
used and appropriated at the present 
time in matters of high importance, 
the word is not only a mean one, but 
it is also indicative of a still meaner 
status or condition. It describes a 
state of mind, opposed to progress 
or reform, that is hopeless. 

Nothing human, at least, is perfect, 
fixed, or unalterable. All things are 



subject to change. "Science has 
taught us definitely to assert that every- 
thing is undergoing constant, eternal, 
and progressive development." In 
its application this law of growth is 
universal. "New occasions teach new 
duties." New laws are constantly sup- 
planting the old. Bven constitutions 
are subject to amendments; and es- 
pecially in economic affairs is this idea 
in keeping with the thought of the 
age. 

Stand-patism is not our doctrine: 
it is the policy of the self-satisfied and 
the schemer. No way or scheme has 
ever been devised under the sun, 
whereby the few have tended to profit 
excessively, which did not at the same 
time tend to rob the many. It is hig^ 
time we were turning our faces to the 
demands of justice and righteousness. 
It has been well said, "Progress springs 
from doubt, and, until men are dis- 
satisfied with the present order, there 
is nothing better for them in the future. ' ' 

MORALS AND MANNERS 

WE clip the following from 
a recent editorial in the 
Congregationalist, and com- 
mend the subject as worthy of earnest 
thought and attention on the part of 
inland dwellers everywhere. Put into 
practice, it means more attractive and 
valuable homes, increased prosperity, 
and the enjoyment of higher pleasures 
and comforts of life: — 

"A score or more of years ago the 
pastor of a rural New England church 
led in organizing a Village Improve- 
ment Association. The neglected com- 
mon on the main street was made 
over into a smooth green lawn, and 
rows of shade-trees were planted. The 
inhabitants, as they came to the store, 
the post-office, and the church, were 
impressed with the change which con- 
stantly grew more pleasing. Some 
of those who lived along that street 
purchased lawn-mowers, set out trees 



Editorials 



185 



and shrubs around their homes, and 
made new paths to their doors. Their 
neighbors felt obliged to follow their 
example. Visitors this summer who 
had not seen the town for several 
years were surprised at the transforma- 
tion. The improvement was evident 
among the people, yoimg and old. An 
honorable pride in their town is mani- 
fest among the inhabitants everywhere. 
Its reputation is high among the neigh- 
boring towns and is extending. 

"There is a genuine gospel in this 
recent proclamation of the mayor of 
Denver: *If your store front, resi- 
dence, or fence, is dingy, repaint it; 
if your awning is torn, old, or faded, 
get a new one. Resolve never to 
throw papers in the street. Ask yoiit 
milkman, groceryman, and pressman 
to have their wagons painted.' The 
police commissioner of Boston has 
lately addressed its citizens along the 
same line. This is a gospel which can 
be preached by ministers and spread 
by laymen, and results may be ex- 
pected in renewed characters not less 
than in improved appearances." 

IGNORANCE OF COMMON THINGS 

THE whole scheme of edu- 
cating girls, an English pro- 
fessor says, is wrong in its 
fundamentals. On the teaching of 
science Professor Smithells says: — 

"As a rule, the science teaching is 
impractical and formal, and the ig- 
norance of educated ladies as to ordi- 
nary domestic matters is appalling. 
Pew schoolmistresses who have taken 
high degrees can give an intelligent 
account of the hot-water system in the 
ordinary house, or tell what it is that 
yeast acts upon when it is mixed with 
dough, or know ixhether a hand mir- 
ror is a test for a damp bed. They do 
not understand why washing soda goes 
white or brass turns green. They 
know nothing of gas meters, filters, or 
clinical thermometers, and are para- 



lyzed before a smoky chimney. The 
reason why girls despise housekeep- 
ing is because they are ignorant, and, 
therefoi:e, find it uninteresting. Teach 
it as a science, he urges, teach it as an 
art, and a vast undeveloped intellect- 
ual region connected with the domestic 
work of women." 

When housekeeping is thus taught, 
and made a part of every young 
woman's education, domestic science 
will be placed on a better footing, and 
the ways of living will be widely im- 
proved. As matters in the average 
household now stand, many people 
have passed the better part of their 
lives before they begin to know how 
to care for themselves and live prop- 
erly. *'We have what we want, and 
we get what we deserve." A few things 
are essential to our well-being here. 
Among these are a cleanly, comfort- 
able dwelling-place, an abundant sup- 
ply of pure water, and a knowledge 
of how to select and prepare whole- 
some food. What need, then, of tonics 
and nostrums? All our force is at- 
tained and maintained solely by the 
food we eat. Why do we not con- 
centrate our efforts to secure the things 
most needful at the expense of count- 
less items that afford merely temporary 
gratification ? 

STRENGTH BY CHEWING 

A PROFESSOR of political econ- 
omy at Yale University, Irving 
^ Fisher, has been conducting ex- 
periments in human physical economy, 
the results of which are published in the 
Yale Alumni Weekly, The experi- 
ments were made with nine Yale 
students, and, beginning in January, 
were continued for about five months. 
The purpose of the experiments was 
to show whether the thorougli mastica- 
tion of food increased its nutritive 
eflSdency, especially its strength-pro- 
ducing eflSciency. 
They made no arbitrary change in 



i86 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



their diet, eating whatever they rel- 
ished. The practice was to thoroughly 
masticate all food eaten, with atten- 
tion fixed on getting all the enjo)mient 
possible from it for the palate. It was 
found that by this manner of eating 
the men gradually lost their desire for 
meat, and came to prefer cereals, fruits, 
and nuts. In June it was found that 
they had, entirely as a matter of indi- 
vidual preference, reduced their con- 
sumption of meat to one-sixth of what 
they had desired at first. In the middle 
of the experiment the men were im- 
proved 50 per cent, in their power of 
endurance, and at the end of the term 
they were able to do double the amount 
of physical work, as shown by the gym- 
nasium tests, that they could do in 
January. 

According to Professor Fisher, **The 
practical conclusion from these experi- 
ments is that it is in the power of a 
healthy individual to double his en- 
durance in five months by thorough 
mastication, prolonging the enjo3rment 
of food and acquiring a more sensitive 
choice of amoimts and kinds to meet 
the varying daily needs of the body." 
Unquestionably there is a kernel of 
wisdom here. It is another demonstra- 
tion of the old physiological maxim 
that, when the initial digestive operation 
is properly performed in the mouth, 
the remaining operations will secure 
the best nutritive results. 

Pacts like these appeal to us. They 
concern every individual. That the 
best nutritive results depend upon 
the thorough mastication of food in 
the mouth is past the need of con- 
firmation. And, besides, the idea is 
reasonable and sensible. "Bodily 
energy is supplied by the food which 
has been assimilated, made a part of 
the body tissues. Much food eaten is 
never so'^utilized. It passes through 
only slightly changed or is decomposed 
into toxic substances that do the body 
harm, and not good. Illnesses which 
come from this cause are said to be 



due to auto-infection." We want to 
derive all the good we can from our 
food, the most satisfactory and whole- 
some nutrition, and the way to attain 
this is by prolonged chewing. 



THE COST OF LIVING 

PROSPERITY is a good thing un- 
doubtedly, taking the large view 
of affairs; but there are many 
whom the present prosperity of the 
country operates to pinch in their re- 
sources. The dollar is becoming of less 
and less Value, reckoning its value by 
what it will purchase of the necessities 
of life. High prices, which are so 
pleasant for those who have things to 
sell, are not equally advantageous to 
those who have to make both ends meet 
without an increased income. It is re- 
ported by those who make a' business of 
computing prices that it requires to-day 
$1.02 to purchase what could have been 
bought for a dollar a month ago, and 
it requires $107 to buy what $100 would 
have purchased a jrear ago. At the 
end of the period of dull times nine 
years ago sixty-six cents would have 
purchased what it requires a dollar to 
purchase now, which is the same as 
sa3ang that the cost of living has in- 
creased 50 per cent. This is a condition 
that makes hard times in spite of sur- 
rounding plenty for those whose wages 
or incomes remain the same, and es- 
pecially for institutions dependent on 
their endowments to conduct their 
work. Those who are prosperous should 
show liberality.

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 

IN «U rcdpes where flour is used, unless otbenrise Stated, the flour ia meuured after rifting once. 
Wben flour is measured hj cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. 
A tablespoonful or a teaspooi^ul of anj derignated material is a levtl spoonful of such material. 



Bisque of Oysters 
Put a quart of milk in a double 
boiler with two slices of onion, two 
stalks of celery, and two sprigs of 
parsley. When the milk is scalded, 
stir in one-third a cup of flour mixed 
to a smooth batter with cold milk. 
Stir until the mixture thickens. Then 
cover, and let cook twenty minutes. 
Pour a cup of cold water over a quart 
of oysters, and look them over carefully, 
to remove bits of shell. Put the oysters 
in a saucepan, and strain the liquor 
and water over them. Heat the whole 
to the boiling-point, then skim and 
strain the first mixture over them. 
Add a teaspoonful and a half of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of black pepper or 
paprika, and mix thoroughly, adding 
meanwhile three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter and half or a whole cup of cream. 



Oyster Broth, Tomatee 
Pour three cups of cold water over 
three pints of oysters, and look over 
the oysters carefully, to remove bits 
of shell. Put the oysters over the fire, 
and strain the liquor through a cheese- 
cloth over them. Bring the whole 
quickly to the boiling-point. Then 
skim out the oysters for use in salad, 
creamed oysters, oyster soufll4 or 
croquettes. Heat the broth again to 
the boiling-point. Let boil three min- 
utes, then skim. Have ready, a cup 
of hot tomato sauce. Stir this into the 
broth. Add a teaspoonful or more 
of salt, half a teaspoonful of paprika. 
Then stir in, gradually, a tablespoonful 
of butter, and serve at once. To make 
the tomato sauce, melt three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, and cook in it 
two tablespoonfuls of raw, lean ham,

half a small carrot, a piece of green 



Partridge 

pepper-pod, and a stalk of celery, all 
chopped fine. Stir and cook until 
delicately browned. Then add three 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir, while 
cooking, until the flour is absorbed. 
Then add a cup and a 
half of canned tomatoes, 
and let boil ten or fifteen 
minutes. Skim, if needed, 
and use as above. 

Roast Partridge 
Truss the well-cleaned 
bird in the same manner 
as a chicken or turkey 
is trussed, and cover the 
breast with slices of mild- 
cured bacon or salt pork. 
Set to cook in a hot oven. 
Baste with melted butter or the drip- 
ping in the pan every five minutes, 



and dredge with flour after basting. 
Cook from half to three-fourths of an 
hour: the flesh, being white, should t>e 
thoroughly cooked. When the joints 
separate easily, the partridge is cooked. 
Put a cup of broth in the baking-pan, 
and let simmer, to dislodge all the 
browned material in the pan. Skim off 
the fat, and serve the residue as a 
sauce. Sherry or claret may be added. 
Bread sauce may also be ser^'ed in a 
sauce- boat. 

Bread Sauce 
Put one pint of rich milk, half a cup 
of grated bread crumbs, an onion, into 
■which five or six cloves have been 
pressed, half a teaspoon ful' of salt, and 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of paprika, in 
a double boiler over the fire. Let cook 
about an hour. When ready to serve, 
remove the onion with the cloves, and 
add two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Then beat thoroughly. 

Chicken Timbale en Surprise 
Remove the breast from a young 
chicken weighing two and a half or 
three pounds. Scrape the chicken pulp 
from the thin inner skin and tendons. 
Scrape also enough pulp from a tender 
vea! cutlet (from the leg) to weigh 
half a pound (generous measure). Add 
a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of 
pepper, and pound the meat with a 



pestle until it is very smooth. Then 
add two ounces (one -fourth a cup)

one by one, two whole eggs or four yolks 
of eggs, pounding the mixture smooth 
between each addition. 
Now press the mixture, 
with a pestle, through a

of butter. Cook in it 



one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, and 
a dash of pepper. Then stir in half a 
cup, each, of chicken stock and cream. 



Chicken Timbale «r Surprisi 

Stir until the boiling-point is reached. 
Then remove from the fire, and stir in 
the sweetbread mixture with two table- 
spoonfuls of sherry wine, and let the 
mixture cool. Line 
the bottom and sides 
of the decorated mould 
with the chicken force- 
meat. Then put some 
of the sweetbread 
preparation into the 
centre of the mould. 
As the forcemeat 
preparation will be the 
firmest when cooked, 
and the timbale, when 
unmoulded, will rest 
on the mixture last 
put into the mould, the forcemeat 
should cover the entire sweetbread 
mixture, at least to the depth of half 
an inch. To insure this, fill in at the 



lialf a cup of flour.

After the sweetbread mixture is put 
into the centre of the mould, the force-

meat mixture can be put in place at the 
sides of the mould with ease. Set 
the mould on a dozen sheets of paper 
(news or wrapping paper) in a sauce- 
pan, and pour in boiling water to half 
the height of the mould. Let cook 
in a moderate oven about an hour, or 
until the mixture is quite firm. The 
water around the mould should not 
boil, and, if the oven is at all hot, the 
mixture should be covered with a 
buttered paper. Five or six minutes 
after the mould has been taken from 
the oven, invert it on a serving-dish, 
and pour around it a pint of cream 



Cottage Pie 
Cook remnants of cold roast lamb 
or veal, cut in thin slices, in stock made 
of the trimmings and bones, 
reinforced by chicken bones 
and remnants of uncooked 
meat, if at hand, until tender. 
Season with salt and pepper, 
and turn into a baking-dish. 
For a pint of meat with cup 
or more of broth, have ready 
about three cups of mashed 
potato, seasoned with salt and 
pepper and thoroughly beaten 
with butter and a little cream. 
Spread a layer of prepared po- 
tato over the meat, then put 
the rest on with a pastry bag and star 
tube. Brush over the potato with the 
yolk of an egg, beaten and diluted with 
a tablespoonful of milk. Set the dish 
in the oven to brown the edges of the 
potato, then serve at once. 

Eggs Cocotte, Convalescent Style 
Pour into an egg-dish one-fourth a 
cup, each, of consomm^ and sweet 
cream. Add a tablespoonful of Ma- 
deira wine, then break into the dish 
two fresh eggs. Set the dish into the 
oven to remain until the eggs are 
lightly set. Then serve at once with

or fresh mushrooms cooked in butter 
may be simmered five minutes in the 
sauce. This will serve ten. 



hot, pulled bread. For a person in 
health, bread crumbs browned in butter 
may be sprinkled over the eggs just 
before the dish is sent to the table. 



Seasonable Recipes 



For pulled bread remove the crust 
from a loaf of fresh bread, and separate 
the crumb into strips with a knife and 
the fingers. Dry these, 
and brown them slightly 
in a slow oven. 

Potatoes, Farci 
Pare three large pota- 
toes. Wash and cut them 
in halves, lengthwise. 
Then scoop out the inside 
of the potato to leave a 
shell about one-eighth of 
an inch thick. Have 
ready as many large 
baked potatoes and a 
shallot or slice of onion, chopped fine 
or grated. Remove the pulp from the 
potatoes. Add the onion, one-fourth 
a cup of butter, half a teaspoonful of 
fine -chopped parsley, and salt and 
pepper to season. Mash, and beat 
untU light, then use in filling the 
potato cases, rounding the mixture 
well. Set on a buttered tin, and let 
cook in a hot oven until the case is 
tender and the filling well browned. 
It will take fifteen or twenty minutes. 



Onions Stuffed with Pecan Nuts 

Peel eight Spanish onions. Let cook 

in boiling water an hour, then remove

Bread Pudding, Thanks- 
giving Style 
Make ready one pint of 
grated bread crumbs. Beat 
the yolks of four eggs; add 
one cup and a half of sugar, 
the grated rind and juice of 
one lemon, or a quarter sec- 
tion of candied orange peel, 
sUced very thin, and mix with 
the crumbs. Gradually stir in 
one quart of milk. Let stand 
about half an hour. Then bake until 
firm in the centre. Let cool a few 
minutes. Then spread currant jelly 
over the top and cover with meringue 
made of the whites of four eggs and 
eight level teaspoonfuls of sugar. Sift 
granulated sugar over the meringue, and 
let cook in a moderate oven eight or ten 
minutes. After covering the jelly with 
meringue, pipe on the rest of the 
meringue as nests. After the meringue 
is browned, set a piece of jelly in each 
nest. Serve hot or cold. 



Apple Pralinees 
Core and peel six or more apples. 
Make a syrup of a cup 
and a half of sugar and 
two cups of water, and in 
this cook the apples until 
tender, turning often to 
keep them in sha[>e and 
have them cooked 
throughout. Remove to 
a serving-dish as soon 
as cooked. Have ready 
about one-third a cup of 
almonds, blanched and 
chopped fine. For each 
apple take two level 
tablespconfuls of sugar 
and a teaspoonful or two 
of the chopped nuts, and 
cook and stir the sugar and nuts over 
a hot fire until the sugar is changed to

Fig Pie 
Cook three-fourths a pound of figs 
in a httle water until the skins are 
tender and the liquid is reduced to 
about half a cup. Chop the figs, first 
discarding the stems. Add half a cup 
of boiled cider, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, one-fourth a cup of sugar, and, 
when cold, use as a filling for the pie. 
The pie may be made with two crusts.

Apple Pie with Meringue 
Pare, core, and stew (with just enough 
water to keep them from burning) 
enough tart apples to make a pint. 
Press the pulp through a sieve. Add 
to it a scant half-teaspoonful of salt, 
half a cup of sugar, a teaspoonful of 
butter, and a grating of nutmeg. 
Put over the fire, and cook until well 
reduced, stirring occasionally. Remove 
from the fire, let cool, and beat in one 
whole egg and the yolks of three, beaten 
light. Have ready a pie tin 
lined with paste, as for a 
custard pie. Pour in the 
apple mixture, and bake until 
firm (about thirty-five min- 
utes). Remove from the 
oven, and let cool while a 
meringue is made ready. 
Spread the meringue over 
the apple, and return the 
pie to the oven to cook the 
meringue. It should take 
about twelve minutes. 

Meringue for Apple Pie 
Beat the whites of three eggs until 



very stiff. Then gradually beat into 
them three level tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. Then remove the beater, and 
cut and fold three tablespoonfuls of 
sugar into the mixture. Flavor with 
lemon, vanilla, or almond extract. 
Use fine granulated sugar. 

Individual Charlotte Russe 
Beat one pint of double cream, one- 
third a cup of sugar, three tablespoon- 
fuls of sherry wine, and one teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla extract until firm to the 
bottom of the bowl. Then set aside to 
chill and stiffen. An hour or more 
before serving, line flaring champagne 
glasses (glass sherbet cups are appro- 
priate, so also are china or paper rame- 
kin cases) with lady fingers, cut in 
strips half an inch wide, letting them 
come up above the top of the glass. 
Fill the glasses with the prepared 
cream, putting on the last with pastry 
bag and tube. Decorate with thin 
slices of preserved ginger and a mara- 
schino cherry. 

Butternut Cakes 
Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. 
Gradually beat in three-fourths a cup 
of granulated sugar, and then one cup 
of butternut meats and one egg, beaten 
without separating. Sift together 
two cups of entire-wheat flour, ooe- 
third a cup of pastry flour, half a tea- 



Buucmut Cakex 



Spoonful of soda, one-fourth a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, half a teaspoonful of mace, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of cloves, and 



Seasonable Recipes 



-195 



three-fourths a teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon. Add this to the first mixture 
alternately with one cup of sour milk. 
Beat thoroughly, and turn into little 
tins, fitted with rounds of paper on the 
bottoms, and thoroughly buttered. 
Bake about twenty-five minutes. The 
recipe makes eighteen cakes. When 
cold, ice with the icing made of brown 
sugar, and decorate with halves of 
butternut meats. 

Boiled Icing (Brown Sugar) 

Boil one cup of brown sugar and 
one-third a cup of water to 240° Fahr. 
Then pour in a fine stream onto the 
^vehite of one egg, beaten very light. 
Continue the beating while the syrup 
is being added to the egg and for some 
minutes afterwards. Without a ther- 
mometer, boil the sugar until it spins 
a thread about three inches in length. 

Cranberry Punch 

Put one quart of cranberries over 
the fire with one pint of water, cover, 
and let cook five or six minutes. Then 
strain through cheese-cloth. Stir in 
two cups of sugar and the juice of a 
lemon, and, when cool, freeze as sher- 
bet. Take out the dasher, and with 
a wooden spoon beat in half a cup of 
claret wine. To serve, put the punch 
in small glasses, make an opening in 
the centre of the mixture in each glass, 
and put in a teaspoonful of claret, 
then serve at once, either with roast 
turkey or just before a game course. 

Flaky Pastry 

Pass through a sieve, together, three 
and one-half cups of sifted fiour, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of baking-powder. With the tips 
of the fingers or a knife work in half 
a cup (four ounces) of shortening 
other than butter, then moisten to a 
dough with cold water (about half a 
cup). Turn onto a board very lightly 
floured, and roll into a very thin rec- 
tangular sheet. Have ready half a cup 



(four oimces) of butter, worked and 
washed in cold water imtil it is in a 
smooth and flexible condition, then 
pat out the water and shape into a 
thin rectangular piece less than one- 
third the length of the paste. Lay 
the butter on the paste, turn one side 
evenly over it, and over this turn the 
•other side. Fold one end over and 
the other end under the paste enclos- 
ing the butter, keeping the ends even, 
pat gently with the rolling-pin, to break 
up the large bubbles of enclosed air, 
then roll into a long rectangular strip. 
Fold evenly to make three layers, turn 
half-way round, and again roll into a 
long strip. Fold, turn, and roll out once 
or twice more, an4 the paste is ready 
to use. When the paste is properly 
made, this process is not a long one. 

Stuffed Eggs, Fried, Sauce Tartare 

Cover six fresh eggs with boiling 
water. Cover closely, and let stand, 
where the heat will be retained and the 
water will not boil, thirty minutes. 
Remove to cold water, and, when 
thoroughly cold, take off the shells. 
Divide the eggs in halves, lengthwise. 
Take out the yolks, and press them 
through a sieve. Add four anchovies 
drained from oil, and picked or pounded 
smooth, one-fourth a cup of soft, fine 
bread crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, salt and paprika to 
taste, with cream to make the whole 
mixture of a consistency to handle. 
Use in filling the spaces from which the 
yolks were taken, giving the mixture 
the shape of whole egg yolks. Beat 
an egg with two tablespoonfuls of 
water. In this roll the prepared eggs. 
Then roll them in soft, fine bread 
crumbs, fry in deep fat to a straw-color, 
and drain on soft paper. Garnish with 
parsley, and serve at once, with a cup 
of mayonnaise dressing into which a 
tablespoonful, each, of fine-chopped 
capers, green pepper-pod, cucumber 
pickles, oHves, parsley, shallot, or mild 
onion, has been stirred.

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 



IN northern latitudes outdoor life 
ends with the advent of gray No- 
vember, From May till November 
life is more or less of a joyous holiday. 
We spend long mornings on the piazza 
with friends or neighbors, and "visit," 
while the family sewing or mending 
goes merrily on. We can exchange 
comments with our neighbors over 
the way while shaking the dust-doth - 
from the open window or door, and 
without hat or wrap run in for a five 
minutes' chat with friends more re- 
mote. But with November this sort 
of life ceases. It is more of an effort 
to be gregarious; and, instead of 
making this extra exertion, we ask 
our friends to break bread with us, 
and in return partake of their hos- 
pitaUty. 

Then comes the question. What 
food shall we set before our friends 
when they visit us? Often the desire 
to honor one's guests or to make a 
fine display gets the better of our 
judgment, and too many dishes are 
attempted. 

A dinner of many courses cannot 
be made ready and served successfully 
without two or more assistants in 
kitchen and pantry. Pew dishes can 
be served at their best unless the 
final cooking take place just the mo- 
ment before they are to appear on the 
plates of the guests. Each course, if 
its evanescent aroma and fiavor are 



to be retained, must be hurried from 
the fire to those awaiting it at the table. 
To cook carefully each course in suc- 
cession and have it ready at the exact 
moment of time scheduled for its ap- 
pearance is a simple ■ matter, when 
everything has been made ready in 
advance and the hostess be not also 
both cook and waitress. 

But let no one fear to entertain her 
friends because of an unpretentious 
establishment. Where there is lack 
of ceremony, often more of true socia- 
bility and pleasure is found; and a 
few choice viands, cooked carefully 
and served hot, will be far better ap- 
preciated than a medley of courses 
brought on in relays from the warming 
oven. 

For instance, in plaiming the Thanks- 
giving dinner, dispense with the soup, 
if there be no one in the kitchen to 
season and dish the turkey and vege- 
tables while the soup is being eaten. 
Dress the salad at the table, and by no 
means have anything hot included in 
the sweet course. 

But think not, because your attention 
is to be confined to turkey and vege- 
tables, that you have nothing to do. 
It is no small matter to cook a turkey 
to perfection. The preliminary clean- 
ing and trussing must be thoroughly 
and skilfully done, and the basting and 
frothing must, indeed, be a labor of 
love; for (unless a double roasting-pan 



After Break&st Chat 



199 



be used), without frequent and repeated 
opemng of the oven door, followed by 
an application of hot fat and flour from 
the dredger to the several sides of the 
fowl, nothing but dry disappointment 
will await you. To enforce this point, 
note what Elwanger says, **In basting 
meats the average cook stands in 
need of constant advice and still more 
constant watching." Also what the 
illustrious cook and author of "The 
Three Musketeers" has to say: ** Above 
all, never moisten your roasts, of 
whatever nature they may be, except 
with butter mixed with salt and pep- 
per. A cook who allows a single drop 
of bouillon in the dripping-pan should 
be instantly discharged and banished 
from France." 

Butter is by no means the article 
commonly used for basting a turkey. 
Fat taken from the top of the soup 
kettle, or cooked out of bacon, salt 
pork, or sausage, is good for this pur- 
pose, if it has not been previously 
burned and does not contain burned 
sediment. The minute solid material 
common in these fats, bums at a lower 
temperature than the fat itself, and, 
if this be left in the- fat used for basting, 
it will detract from the rich golden 
brown tint which we are wont to as- 
sociate with a carefully cooked turkey. 
Each time after basting dredge with 
flour. The flour will cook in the hot 
fat, forming a frothy-looking coating, 
much desired by epicures. 

L^t the mashed potatoes be smooth 
and lightly beaten, seasoned "to point" 
and hot, the onions salted during the 
cooking, cream or butter being added 
while hot, the celery clean and crisp, 
the cranberries cooked no more than 
five minutes, and who could ask for 
a more satisfactory Thanksgiving din- 
ner? But, if a sweet seems to you a 
more fitting ending to the meal, a 
squash or pumpkin pie, or a fruit cup, 
— fruit sherbet with bits of fresh and 
preserved fruits in the bottom of the 
glass, — or a charlotte russe, may be 



partially made ready the day before, 
and finished in the morning long before 
the cooking of the main dishes of the 
dinner demands your whole attention. 

The ambitious cook, with plenty of 
time at her disposal, and desirous of 
finding new ways in which to present 
old-time favorites, is most disturbed 
by the multiplicity of styles from which 
selection is to be made. She dislikes 
to try experiments, and usually takes 
what some one else has tried and not 
found wanting. I^t such an one try 
filling the body of the carefully cleaned 
turkey with whole chestnuts. The 
chestnuts should first be shelled and 
blanched, then cooked nearly tender in 
well-seasoned broth, or they may be 
shelled after roasting. The chestnuts 
will be found most palatable. They 
are improved by the prolonged cooking 
in the turkey. This cannot be said of 
oysters thus used. If a plat still more 
ambitious appeals to your taste, let 
the turkey be boned. Begin by cutting 
the skin down the full length of the 
back. Then, when the boning is com- 
pleted, lay the flesh, skin side down, on 
the board, and lay upon it a boned 
chicken or a boiled tongue, filling in 
wherever there is space with veal or 
fresh pork forcemeat. Roll the turkey 
carefully into a compact shape. Sew 
through the skin. Then roast as the 
ordinary turkey, taking especial pains 
to cook with very moderate heat and a 
little longer than usual. If the age 
of the turkey be doubtful, steam it 
an hour. Then finish the cooking in 
the oven. A turkey thus prepared 
is a delight to the carver tmacquainted 
with anatomy. 

Where economy does not have to 
be considered, truffles, so harmoniously 
associated with grain-fed fowls and 
fatty dishes, may be introduced here 
and there in the forcemeat. At pres- 
ent, in this country, it must be the 
canned esculent; but Perigord truffles, 
which have been "studied by botanists,

Edible Menu Cards 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



THIS magazine has from time 
to time mentioned marzipan, 
and given directions for its 
manufacture in the home kitchen by 
slightly simpler processes than are used 
at candy factories. It is a confection 
much esteemed abroad, and, though it 
consists only of almond paste and 
sugar, the foreign name ** marzipan" 
makes people think it something too- 
unheard-of to consider. 

In attractive forms, such as peas 
in their pods, asparagus ends, tiny 
rosebuds, potatoes, carrots, turnips, 
pigs, etc., it may be found at all good 
candy stores. Wish-bones are favorite 
shapes for Hallowe'en; but it is an- 
nounced, by a New York authority 
that in London it is being used for 
edible menu cards. 

There is a box propped upright by 
each cover, which contains pink marzi- 
pan, on which are lettered in white 
icing the dishes one may enjoy. At 
the end of the dinner the marzipan 
forms an agreeable sweet, or a very 
dainty souvenir, for future tasting. 

A certain Herr Willy is said to be the 
inventor of these. One may give him 
the credit of using marzipan as a menu 
card; but marzipan so ornamented in 
boxes has long been used for gifts on 
the Continent. So, if Herr Willy has 
just introduced them in London, he is 
but cop)ring from the Christmas gifts 
familiar in Germany Often elaborate 
wreaths surround such boxes, with 
lettering appropriate to the occasion, 
and the recipient's name or initials 
in the centre, just as we have the 
same upon wedding cake or Easter 
eggs. 

Marzipan may be used to stuff large 
raisins for a bonne-bouche, or balls of it 
can be covered with chocolate for bon- 
bons. 

The following recipe was brought 



from Germany by a lady who makes 
it for holidays. Her practical direc- 
tions will be found very useful. She 
does not attempt to finish it in the fancy 
forms used by professionals. 

Take one pound of sweet almonds 
and about six bitter almonds. Blanch 
them in the usual manner by scalding 
with hot water, and then remove the 
brown skins. Place the almonds in 
cold water, and leave them for two or 
three days, changing the water twice 
or even three times each day. After 
the almonds have been drained and 
thoroughly dried on a soft towel, they 
are to be grated (in Germany they 
have an esp)ecial grater for this work) 
or ground, and then pounded in a mortar 
until they form a smooth paste. 

Add one-half a pound of powdered 
sugar, and put the almond paste and 
the sugar in a bright saucepan over 
a moderate fire. An agate dish will 
do, but a copper sugar boiler is better. 
No water is to be added. The almonds 
are moist, and the sugar dissolves. It 
must be stirred constantly. At first it 
will seem a strange and discouraging 
mixture; but presently it will cease 
to cling to the sides of the pan, and 
will form in a ball about the spoon. 
Let it cool. Then knead into it one 
pound of powdered sugar. Knead it 
just as you do bread. This is now 
marzipan paste; and it is ready for 
forming into shapes with the fingers 
or by means of small carved wooden 
moulds. After being shaped, the marzi- 
pan must be dried a few hours before 
being browned in the oven. If they 
are too fresh, they will burst open and 
their shape be destroyed. A "sala- 
mander" iron is the best thing to brown 
them. 

Flavor with orange-flower water, 
rose, jessamine, or what you will. A 
clove end makes a good thing for the

blossom end of an apple. Colors come 
to tint the surfaces, which are harmless, 
if you vrish to imitate fruit, etc. 

A further hint is this: If you try to 
grind the almonds in the usual kitchen 



grinders or choppers, it is well to use 
the coarsest knife first. Then put them 
through the next size, and so on. If 
you try to grind them to a paste by one 
process, you are apt to have trouble. 



About Beds 




ByL. 

Bed-making 

ID you have a good bed?" 
is one of the standard ques- 
tions asked returning so- 
journers at summer hotels. This 
generally follows the query, ** How was 
the table?" showing that the resting- 
place is almost as important as the 
diet for htunan beings. And why 
not ? We certainly are dependent upon 
our beds, literally, for a good many 
hours. 

There are beds and beds. Some are 
just straight, uncomfortable, hard, and 
unchangeable; but many times they 
can be helped. Very few people reaHze, 
judging by many beds in many places, 
that a spring can be rendered far more 
springy by a change in the slats be- 
neath. Pile foiu" slats at the second 
slat socket at the head, and three at 
the second slat socket at the foot, and 
set the spring down upon the two piles. 
You will exclaim at the difference, es- 
pecially if the spring has become a bit 
saggy. It does not then go down with 
your weight and strike upon the bed 
slats. The extra inch at the top will 
give added comfort, as most beds tend 
to be a little lower at the head. All 
this, of course, refers to the wooden 
bedstead which is still largely met with 
in summer hotels. 

A hard mattress is indeed a hard 
proposition, but one can sometimes lay 
hands upon a comfortable with which 
to cover it, or some of the quilted pad- 
ding that all department stores keep. 
It were better to buy either for one's self 



F. M. 

than to suffer through nearly half one's 
vacation from a hard mattress. 

Then so much depends, at home or 
abroad, upon the way a bed is made. 
Aside from the daily turning of the mat- 
tress, the lower sheet should be so 
smoothed and tucked in, so free from 
wrinkles, that it resembles a hospital 
bed. The upper sheet should be well 
tucked in at the foot, and likewise the 
blanket, so that a little harder puU at 
the covers may not give one the feeling 
of despair that follows ** pulling every- 
thing out at the foot." Especially does 
this feeling attack the masculine mind, 
for most men are so helpless as to the 
process of bed-making at any time. A 
very good housekeeper taught the writer 
years ago to leave enough of the upper 
sheet at the top, however, to turn over 
the first blanket in summer and both 
in winter, so that it protects the less 
easily washed blankets from soil from 
the sleeper's face, besides being so 
much more grateful to the skin of face 
and neck. 

After these essentials the bed can be 
made as attractive with dainty spreads 
and the like as one wishes; but, if the 
bed-making is not right, it is a delusion 
and a snare. Personally, I like my well- 
bealen pillows covered with shams or 
scarf. The pillows are certainly sweeter 
to lie upon at night, if the dust has not 
been allowed to collect upon them dur- 
ing the day. 

One important thing in keeping a 
bed nice is the care with whidi it is 
opened. The spread should be care- 



202 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



fully folded back once, once again, and 
then placed smoothly back upon the 
footboard, unless, indeed, it be re- 
moved altogether and folded. For or- 
dinary use, however, the above is a 
good way. If the spread is tossed 
back and lies in half-rumpled condi- 
tion, the bed next day has the effect of 
a slept-in garment. The pillow pro- 
tector should be removed and carefully 
folded or placed where it will not 
wrinkle, the bed clothes turned down, in 
summer folding back the first blanket 
upon the foot-board, taking care, how- 



ever, to leave the upper end where a 
sleepy hand may easily find it to draw 
up, should the extra covering be re- 
quired. 

The folding back of sheet and blanket 
should be done precisely and evenly, 
not simply tossing them back. 

With night pillows arranged care^ 
fully, straight across the head-board, the 
linen clean, one soft light in readiness 
for the room's occupant, a pitcher of 
ice water at hand, what guest does not 
anticipate the coming of tired Nature's 
sweet restorer under these conditions. 



Foreign Pensions 

Second Paper 
By Arthur W. Brayley 



IUNCHEON was at one o'clock, 
comprising warmed-over dishes. 
^Tea was at 4.30, and dinner at 
six o clock. 

Let me give the menu: soup, fish, 
roast, dessert, fruit, coffee. Each day 
had its own course, so that **steadv" 
boarders knew what was to be served 
on every day in the week, and, strange 
to say, it was never varied. Neither 
was the method of cooking or ^rving 
altered. After a while one's taste 
became so trained that he could in 
imagination, taste every dish to be 
served from Monday's breakfast to 
Sunday's diimer. 

There were guests that looked hale 
and hearty after years of this fare. 
True, they dined out frequently. So 
did we. Nevertheless, we longed for 
a change. 

The soup was of foiu* varieties, and 
alwa3rs was good. The fish, of five 
kinds, was never out of the fry. The 
beef I Ah ! there was the trial, as tender 
as a scrod, but as tasteless as a tooth- 
pick. In fact, one could hardly tell 



by taste which was fowl, pheasant, 
veal, or beef. And the vegetables! 
Why does the English cook think that 
all vegetables must be cooked and 
served like boiled potatoes? I am 
not sure, but I have a suspicion, that 
vegetables of all kinds are cooked in 
a pot at one and the same time. They 
taste like it. An English potato is a 
baked potato once and forever. "Beet- 
roots " are bought cooked at the market. 
They are the sugar beet, and are as 
large as a quart measure and about 
as hard. Then there are carrots, pars- 
nips, turnips, and artichokes; but the 
three great and steady vegetables, 
one or all of which are served even if 
the potato is absent, are cabbage, cauli- 
flower, and Brussels sprouts. 

For dessert the tart was present ever; 
but to the Yankee palate it will never 
take the place of pie. Of course there 
were puddings of various kinds, also 
jellies, etc.; but the tart is as distinc- 
tively English as the pie is American. 
Many times I have heard Americans

How to keep Plants Healthy in 
Winter 

USE the water in which the clothes 
have been boUed for your plants. 

The lye from the laundty soap will 
supply sufficient heat to the ground 
to insure healthy plants during the 
coldest weather. 

The gloss of a rubber plant is greatly 
increased by the use of a teaspoonful 
of sweet oil about its roots once a 
month. B. p. 



POT roast is greatly improved if 
cooked in the following manner: 
Heat an iron pot until it is smoking 
hot, put in the meat, and let it brown 
well, turning often to prevent burn- 
ing. Cover with boiling water, and 
let it gently simmer until tender. A 
little salt may be added to the water. 
When the meat is tender, the water 
will have evaporated considerably. 
Use the remainder, either with or with- 
out thickening, as a sauce. 



How we removed Soot from Carpets 
after the Earthquake 

TO those of us Uving in the dis- 
tricts visited by the havoc and 
ruin of the recent earthquake, and who 
were fortimate enough to have a home 
remaining, there was at once pre- 
sented the problem of how to remove 
the soot which covered carpets and 
furniture, for the great shock acted as 
a chimney-sweep, scattering the fine 



dust over everything. We first swept 
up the greater quantity of soot, being 
careful not to use force enough to 
brush it into the carpet. Then equal 
quantities of salt and com-meal were 
sprinkled over, brushed in thoroughly, 
and then the carpet was swept. In 
some spots it was necessary to repeat 
thejjrocess, but the result was a clean, 
bright carpet, innocent of spot or blem- 
ish. If carpets are sprinkled with 
this mixture before sweeping, they 
will be brightened and freshened. If 
it is desired to more thoroughly clean 
a carpet or rug without taking it up, 
it may be sprinkled with com-meal 
moistened with ammonia or gasolene. 
Then go over the carpet with a whisk 
broom, using a short, quick, strong 
motion, or tap lightly with a flexible 
rug-beater. Sweep and repeat, if nec- 
essary.

Ragout of Veal 

Ingredients: two tablespoon fuls of 
minced onion, two table spoonfuls of 
butter, slices of cold cooked veal, one 
cup of veal gravy, one tablespoonful 
of tomato ketchup. Salt and pepper. 

Method. — Cook onion in butter five 
minutes. Add slices of cold, cooked 
veal (boiled or roasted), sprinkle each 
slice with salt and pepper, cover with 
veal gravy, seasoned with ketchup, 
allow to become hot, and serve with 
slices overlapping each other on platter. 
Garnish with toast points and stuffed 
olives. The quantity of gravy, etc., 
is sufficient for seven or eight medium- 
sized slices of veal. h. n. p.

Scientific and Useful 

THE Medical and Surgical Re- 
porter contains a curious article 
on the * 'Suspension of Old Age," the 
leading idea of which is that **the real 
change which produces old age is noth- 
ing, more or less, ^han a slow but 
steady accumulation of calcareous 
matter throughout the system; and 
it is owing to these deposits that the 
structure of every organ is altered, 
elasticity thus giving way to senile 
rigidity. Blockage of various organs 
thus commenced, and, sooner or later, 
a vital part becomes involved, and 
death of necessity follows. To delay 
thjs process, the writer advises the 
avoidance of food containing this^cal- 
careous matter, among which bread 
is common. Moderation in eating is 
enjoined; and among the articles 
recommended are fruit, fish, poultry, 
flesh of young mutton and beef, be- 
cause, as before stated, of their being 
less nitrogenous. All well and spring 
water contains considerable of the 
earthy salts, and should therefore be 
avoided, and cistern water used in its 
stead, because water is the most imi- 
versal solvent known. Therefore, if 
taken into the system clear of foreign 
matter, it is to that extent the better 
prepared to dissolve and take up those 
earthy salts, and convey them out of 
the system. The addition of fifteen 
or twenty drops of diluted phosphoric 
acid to the glass of water, and drank 
three times a day, will add to the 
solubility of these earthy salts.

Derivations of Names of some Com- 

mon Foods 

BREAD comes from the Anglo- 
Saxon, and is derived from the same 
root as brew, a reference to the raising 
or lightening of the bread by the use 
of hops. Butter comes from the Greek 



word bous, one form of the word 
being boutyron. 

Beef derives its name from bos, the 
Latin for ox, once spelled boef. In 
the rude Norseman's language, a roast 
of beef was steik, and from that came 
our steak. Sirloin steak was the sur, 
or upper, loin. There is a story that 
James I. once knighted a loin of beef, 
making it Sir Loin, thus originating 
the name. 

Porcus is the Latin for hog, hence 
it is easy to see how the flesh of swiae 
came to be called pork. Sausage came 
from the Latin, sal, salt. Originally 
sausage was salt meat, smoked and 
dried. Sauce is derived from salsus, 
and meant a relish or flavor. 

Mult was once a Latin word for 
sheep, hence mutton. Veau was the 
French name for calf, and so the flesh 
of a calf came to be called vecU. Ve- 
natis being the Latin for hunt, deer 
flesh is venison. 

Soup used to be sop, and originally 
meant a gravy or sauce in which 
bread was sopped or dipped, as is 
still the custom in some parts of the 
world. 

Pie is the name of an English bird. 
Possibly, when magpies or some other 
pied or potted birds were cooked in 
a crust of paste, the dish was called 
a pie. Afterwards all dishes of this 
form, whether filled with fruit or 
flesh, came to be so called. Cake 
probably comes from cook, indicating 
that which has been cooked. Coke, 
a refined form of coal, comes from 
the same source: it is cooked coal. 
Pudding comes from pool, which is 
Danish for pud, paw, so pudden is 
to thicken by stirring, and hence a 
pudding is something which has been 
stirred. 

One of our favorite desserts, Char- 
lotte russe, comes from the name of 
a Russian princess, while blanc 
mange is from two French words, 
signifying ''something white to eat."

"A Children's Sitting-room*' 

AS that period in the life of the 
average parent, when the children 
are young, is usually not the time of 
the greatest affluence, an ideal arrange- 
ment for the * 'children's quarters" in 
a household is seldom possible. In a 
spacious home one or two sleeping- 
rooms and one "living" or day room 
with a bath-room of their own do 
not seem too great a proportion of space 
to be allotted to a family of two or 
three children, but, unfortunately, the 
average child is forced to content him- 
self with far less luxury than this. In 
too many homes it is the case that, 
when there has been provided com- 
fortable sleeping arrangements by 
night and a comer in almost any room 
for a few playthings by day, the con- 
science of the parent is set at rest. 
There is seldom a house so small that 
it does not provide, at least, three bed- 
rooms for family use. Let the largest 
and sunniest of these (always a south- 
em exposure, when possible) be given 
up to the children, and made into a 
room in which they can **live," where 
the long afternoons of winter may be 
passed in content and comfort. The 
first requirement of such a room is a 
large, roomy closet. Half of it should 
be used for * 'hanging" space, the other 
half for a plain, pine, * 'built-in" ward- 
robe, with two deep drawers across 
the bottom, and shelves above. On 
the top shelf should be kept pads, pen- 
cils, scissors, mucilage, etc.; on the 
other shelves, toys, dolls, and books of 
all descriptions. Such things as dolls' 
beds, tables, etc., would find space on 
the floor of the closet. The floor cover- 
ing of the room should be of a pretty 
figured Japanese matting, and a wain- 
scoting of matting should be on the 
walls. There is no better or more at- 
tractive covering for that space of the 
wall which comes in such frequent and 
dangerous contact with little hands. 
Spots and stains can be easily removed. 



sticky paper does not "stick" success- 
fully, and no amotmt of "pinning" 
can harm it. Around the top of the 
wainscoting, with an occasional hook 
"screwed in" at intervals underneath, 
and from the shelf to the ceiling is a 
paper of well-drawn design, — not a 
paper pleasing to the mother because 
of its appropriateness in being covered 
with complicated rows of Greenaway 
figures, but a paper so pure in de- 
sign and so simple in line that the 
child's first instinct would be to sit 
down and copy it. One excellent de- 
sign is of the "small tree" pattern, 
moderately conventionalized. The 
trees are at restful intervals apart, with 
the simplest tulip design between each 
one, carried out in shades of cream, 
soft greens, and yellows. Across the 
wide sunny window there should be 
a long, low window seat (of course, 
"box" in form, where articles can be 
stowed away) of a height which the 
children can comfortably "sit up" to 
in their little chairs, and built in at 
each end of the seat should be book- 
shelves to the floor. Outlining the 
windows, are curtains of cotton print, 
with a valance across the top, — ^the 
Noah's Ark" pattern is simple in de- 
sign and good in color. 

In the centre of the room is a 
small "library" table of mission de- 
sign, about three feet long by a foot 
and a half wide. At .one end of the 
table stands a miniature Morris chair, 
and at the other end another small 
chair of good design. Somewhere 
in the room should be placed a 
small chiffonnier, or chest of drawers, 
of dark-stained oak. The handles of 
the drawers should be roimd wooden 
ones. If it is necessary that this room 
should be used also as a bedroom, have 
two small beds or cots, low at each 
end, for which slip covers can be made, 
on which sofa cushions can be used 
by day. The few pictures should be 
plainly framed photographs of some 
of the "Old Masters," such as Van

Dyck's **Chadren of Charles I." and 
one or two of the Florentine ma- 
donnas. With such a room we might 
have reason to feel that we had taken 
one of the first steps toward cultivating 
the tastes of our children.

Individual Bottles of Grape Juice 

ONE of the newest wa3rs in which 
manufacturers are considering the 
needs and pleasures of the purchasing 
public is the extension of the package 
system to such small portions as in- 
(Uviduals may require. 

We have tiny moulds of choicest 
jellies, in dainty glasses, made from 
a pleasing variety of fruits, which are 
put up by a firm in the fruit regions of 
New York State. Grape juice now 
comes in five-cent bottles suitable for 
an invalid's use. Often a larger bottle 
spoils before the variable appetite of a 
patient requires even what comes in 
the smaller sizes. Of course, in a family 
there are well persons who are not 
averse to this healthful beverage, or 
what is not needed may be quickly 
converted into a glass, or more, of 
jelly by a few minutes' boiling and the 
addition of sugar. 

These tiny bottles, labeled and sealed 
precisely Uke the larger ones, are very 
nice for school luncheon baskets. 
There is no danger of the cork becom- 
ing loose. For traveling they are de- 
lightful. Oftentimes a visitor is in 
need of some trifling lunch, though the 
hostess is doing all she can for her guest. 
There are times, just after a drive or 
before retiring, when perhaps one may 
desire a glass of grape juice and a 
cracker without making the wish known 
to the family. Failing a corkscrew, 
of course the cork may be pried out in 
feminine fashion with scissors, but 
better still are the little cheap cork- 



screws, such as come gratis with ink- 
bottles. 

Grape juice may be added to lemon- 
ade in place of claret, with a bit of 
mint crushed with the sugar and an- 
other sprig added to garnish the top.

Query 1175. — M. L. H., Redlands, Cal.: 
" Recipes for mint sandwiches, almond griddle- 
cakes, Indian tapioca pudding, German potato 
pancake served with braised beef, sauce to 
serve with delicate Indian pudding, grape- 
fruit cocktail, cherry bisque with candied cher- 
ries, and nun and banana pie. In the Decem- 
ber, 1905, number, in the recipe for roast 
^oose, are sage and onion sprinkled on the in- 
side of the goose when a prune dressing is 
used? In the same magazine, what is the 
foundation on which the cheese cutlets are 
placed, and is the decoration on top sprigs of 
parsley?" 

Mint Sandwiches 

Cut white bread into slices one-fourth 
an inch thick. Cut the slices into such 
shapes as is desired, removing the 
crusts meanwhile. Spread the pre- 
pared bread very lightly with choice 
butter. Then press the candied mint 
leaves on to one-half of the slices, and 
cover them with the other half. Or 
beat one-fourth a cup of butter to a 
cream. Beat in one or two tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, a tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice, and fresh mint 
leaves washed, dried, and chopped 
fine, to give the color and flavor desired. 
Use this as filling for bread prepared as 
above. 

Almond Griddle-cakes 

Sift together one cup and a fourth 
of sifted flour, one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of salt, and two level teaspoonfuls of 
baking-powder. Beat the yolk of an 
egg, add a scant cup of milk, and stir 
into the dry ingredients. Then add 



two ounces of blanched almonds, 
chopped fine, and browned in the oven, 
and the white of one egg, beaten dry. 
Bake on a hot, well-oiled griddle, first 
on one side and then on the other. 

Indian Tapioca Pudding 

Scald one quart of milk in a double 
boiler. Then stir while sprinkling in 
one-fourth a cup of Indian meal and 
one-third a cup of quick-cooking tapi- 
oca. Continue the cooking and stirring 
until the tapioca becomes transparent. 
Then add two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and one cup 
of molasses. Mix thoroughly, and turn 
into a buttered baking-dish. Pom- 
over the mixture one cup and a half of 
cold milk, and set the dish into the 
oven without stirring in the milk. 
Bake about one hour. Serve with 
or without cream. 

Sauce to serve with Indian Pudding 

Cream and sugar are most commonly 
served with an Indian pudding. Oc- 
casionally vanilla ice-cream is used as 
a sauce. When the pudding **whe5rs, *' 
the whey might be considered the only 
sauce needful. 

German Potato Pancake 
In a hot, well-oiled irying-pan grate 
enough boiled potato, either hot or cold, 
to cover the bottom of the dish to the 
depth of half an inch. Dredge very 
lightly with salt, then pom- over a

batter made of one cup of flour, two 
level teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, two 
eggs, and about a cup of milk. Use 
enough of the batter to cover well the 
potato. When the pancake is full 
of bubbles and browned beneath, turn 
and brown the other side. 

Grape-fruit Cocktail 

Cut the grape-fruit in halves across 
the grain, to form two portions. With 
a thin, sharp-pointed knife cut around 
the pulp in each section, close to the 
membrane, and lift out the triangular 
pieces of pulp. Chill these with all 
the juice from the fruit. When ready 
to serve, mix the chilled pulp and juice 
with a little powdered sugar, and, if 
desired, sherry wine or Jamaica rum, or 
with a little maraschino and one or two 
cherries. Serve in small glasses. 

Cherry Bisque with Candied Cherries 

and Rum 
At this season the bisque must, of 
course, be made of canned cherries. 
Candied cherries might also be used 
if less rich fruit were not at hand. For 
the sake of color and shape candied 
cherries, one or two in each cup, might 
be added at the moment of serving. 
The cherries used should be tender 
enough to pass through a sieve. This 
pulp, with the juice, and water, if 
needed, should be thickened slightly 
with cornstarch. After cooking ten 
minutes, add the candied cherries, cut 
in halves (if canned cherries are at 
hand, a larger number may be used), 
and rum to flavor as desired. Serve 
in cups as a first course at luncheon. 
Pass at the same time crackers or toast, 
Ughtly wet with rum and sprinkled with 
sugar. The soup may be served cold, 
in which case it should be thickened 
but slightly. 

Banana Pie 

Pass enough peeled bananas through 
a vegetable ricer to fill a cup. To 



this add half a cup of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of molasses, or the grated 
rind and juice of half a lemon, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, one beaten egg, 
one-third a teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
half a cup of milk, and one-third a 
cup of cream. Mix all together thor- 
oughly, and bake until firm in a pie 
plate lined with pastry as for squash 
pie. 

Sage and Onion with Prune Dressing 

Omit dredging the inside of a goose 
with sage and onion when a prune 
dressing is to be used. Unless the 
goose be a very large one, half or three- 
fourths a cup of rice and other in- 
gredients accordingly will give enough 
stuffing. 

Foundation for Cheese Cutlets 

(December, 1905) 

For the foundation on which the 
cheese cutlets referred to stand, a hot- 
cooked cereal was moiUded in a border 
mould. When cold and tmmoulded, 
the cereal was brushed over with 
white of egg, slightly beaten, and then 
sprinkled with fine-chopped parsley. 
A paper aigrette or frill was inserted 
in the pointed end of the cutlets, and 
the open centre of the mould of cereal 
was filled with sprigs of parsley.

Preserving Eggs 

(United States Agricultural Department) 

Fill an earthen or water-tight wooden 
vessel with the eggs. To one part of 
^water glass, also known as soluble 
^lass and siUcate of soda, add ten parts 
of tepid water, stirring the water thor-

When the resultant mixture is cold, 
pour it gently over the eggs, using suf-

of water glass and thirty pints, or fif- 
teen quarts, of water will generally 
cover fifty dozen eggs. Keep the 
vessel covered and in a cool place.

Query 1179. — Madame G. E. Larin, Mon- 
treal, Canada: "Recipes for almond paste, 
Angelica wine, soup crecy, and nut custard 
pie. At what time of the meal are fruit salads

Almond Paste 

The making of almond paste at 
home is a long and laborious process. 
It may be bought at any place where 
fancy groceries are kept, or of a baker 
or confectioner by the pound, or in 
five-pound cans. 

Angelica Wine 

Angelica wine is probably made from 
the roots or seeds of a plant of that 
name. The tubular, green, aromatic 
leaf stalks of this plant are candied and 
imported to this country for use in 
sweet dishes. This plant is also used in

flavoring various spirituous compounds 
of Northern and Southern Europe. We 
do not think the plant is found in this 
country, and can suggest no recipe for 
making the wine. 

Soup Crecy 

Scrape, wash, and slice six fresh, 
bright-colored carrots. Put these into 
a saucepan with two onions, sliced, and 
two or three tablespoonfuls of butter or 
dripping. Stir frequently while cooking 
the vegetables to a bright brown color. 
Then add two quarts and a half of 
white broth, and let simmer gently 
until the carrots are tender, probably 
about forty minutes. Press the whole 
through a sieve, and set over the fire 
to reheat. In the mean time melt one- 
fourth a cup of butter. Cook in this 
one-fotulh a cup of flour and half a 
teaspoonful of salt. Stir in half a cup 
of cream, and then two cups of the 
pur^e. When the mixture boils, stir 
it gradually into the rest of the pur6e. 
Add more seasoning, if needed, and 
strain into the soup tureen. Pass 
croutons at the same time. 

Nut Custard Pie 

Add a cup or more of crushed nut 
meats to the eggs and sugar made ready 
for a custard pie. Add salt and milk, 
and bake as any custard pie. 

Time of Serving Fruit Salads, etc. 

A fruit salad, sweet or otherwise, is 
served after the main course of the meal, 
at the point where a sweet entremet 
would naturally app)ear if this dish were 
not served.

with cold water, and let them stand 
overnight. In the morning put them 
over the fire with half an onion, a stalk 
of celery, two sprigs of parsley, and half 



a dozen slices of carrot, adding more 
water, if needed. Let the whole simmer 
until the mushrooms are tender. Then 
press the whole through a sieve, or pick 
out the vegetables and press the mush- 
rooms only through the sieve. To this 
pur^ add water or white stock to make 
one quart. Melt one-fourth a cup of 
butter. Cook in it one-fourth a cup of 
floiu-, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a 
teaspoonful of pepper. Add one quart 
of milk, and stir and cook until the 
sauce boils. Then add the purde, and, 
when again boiUng, remove to a cooler 
part of the range. Add the yolks of 
two eggs, beaten and mixed with half 
or a whole cup of cream, and stir a few 
moments without boiling. Add more 
salt and pepper, if needed, and serve at 
once.

starch in ripened or semi-ripened cereal 
products is in the form of sugar when 
the substance is in the milky state. 
Starch has to be changed to sugar before 
it can be assimilated by the body. 

Why is Uncooked Food considered 

More Wholesome than Cooked 

Food? 

Do not think — ^speaking in a general 
way — that tmcooked food is more 
wholesome than cooked food. A raw 
egg is more easily digested than a cooked 
one. So also is a raw beefsteak, if it 
be as palatable. But there are good 
and sufficient reasons why the most of 
us prefer our eggs, and especially our 
steak, cooked. A cooked apple may 
often be eaten when an uncooked one 
would cause digestive disturbance. 

Change of Chemical Properties in 

Food by Cooking 

Starch is changed to sweet substances 
akin to sugar, as in the crust of bread 
and baked potatoes, long, slow cooking 
of oatmeal and breakfast foods. 

Why is less Uncooked than Cooked 

Food needed to sustain Life ? 

In uncooked food none of the food 
compounds are lost, evaporated in too 
strong heat or dissolved in water that 
is thrown away. If cooking be properly 
conducted, no great proportion of the 
food elements should be lost in the 
process. Uncooked food requires more 
mastication than cooked, and thereby 
more of the food elements may be as- 
similated. 

Why Butter should be Unsalted 

Briefly, because we eat too much salt. 
Mineral matter is essential, especially 
in the food of the yoimg, to build bone 
and sustain the integrity of the blood. 
We ought to get this matter in our food 
in sufficient quantity; but we have 



come, largely through custom, to think 
we do not get enough chloride of 



A Food Convert 

Good Food the True Road to Health 

The pernicious habit some persons 
still have of relying on nauseous drugs 
to relieve dyspepsia keeps up the 
patent medicine business, and helps 
keep up the army of dyspeptics. 

Indigestion — dyspepsia — is caused 
by what is put into the stomach in the 
way of improper food, the kind that 
so taxes the strength of the digestive 
organs they are actually crippled. 

When this state is reached, to resort 
to stimulants is like whipping a tired 
horse with a big load. £very addi- 
tional effort he makes under the lash 
increases his loss of power to move the 
load. 

Try helping the stomach by leaving 
off heavy, greasy, indigestible food, 
and take on Grape-nuts — ^Ught, easily 
digested, full of strength for nerves 
and brain in every grain of it. There's 
no waste of time or energy when Grape- 
nuts is the food. 

"I am an enthusiastic user of Grape- 
nuts, and consider it an ideal food," 
writes a Maine man. 

''I had nervous dyspepsia and was 
all run down, and my food seemed to 
do me but little good. Prom reading 
an advertisement I tried Grape-nuts 
food, and, after a few weeks* steady 
use of it, felt greatly improved. 

''Am much stronger, not nervous 
now, and can do more work without 
feeling so tired, and am better every 
way. 

**I relish Grape-nuts best with cream, 
and use four heaping teaspoonf uls at a 
meal. I am sture there are thousands 
of persons with stomach trouble who 
would be benefited by using Grape- 
nuts." Name given by Postum Com- 
pany, Battle Creek, Mich. Read the

sodium (common salt) in this way, 
and so add it to most articles of food. 
But salt is a condiment, and the appe- 
tite for it grows, more and more of it 
being demanded to satisfy us. In the 
manufacture of butter this salty sub- 
stance, present originally in the milk, 
is partially, at least, lost, and thus 
naturally, though chiefly on account of 
perverted taste, salt is added to butter. 
Probably with a varied diet, in which 
green, uncooked vegetables and fruit 
are given ample place, unsalted butter 
might be eaten with advantage to the 
system. There is also a question 
whether mineral matter in a free or 
unorganized condition (as salt, sulphur 
phosphorus, etc.) can take the place 
in the economy of nature of the 
mineral matter combined with other 
elements in a food substance. 

Starchy Foods, Fermentation, and 
Limy Deposits 
Starchy or vegetable foods, espe- 
cially in combination with sugar, are 
very prone to fermentation. This is 
the reason why a cup of coflfee sweetened 
with sugar or a dish of sweetened 
oatmeal produces, under certain con- 
ditions, an acid state of the stomach. 
Grains are thought to contain a com- 
paratively large proportion of mineral 
matter. This is needed by growing 
children for the making of bone and 
teeth. In adults, who do not need 
building material, an excess of such 
matter taken into the system may be 
deposited in the joints to the detriment 
of health. 

Why Fermentation is a Deleterious 
Process in Culinary Art 
The digestive fluids contain several 



Husband Deceived 

But Thanked his Wife Afterwards 

A man ought not to complain if his 
wife puts up a little job on him, when 



he finds out later that it was all on 
account of her love for him.* Mighty 
few men would. 

Sometimes a fellow gets so set in his 
habits that some sort of a ruse must 
be employed to get him to change, and 
if the habit, like excessive coflfee-drink- 
ing, is harmful, the end justifies the 
means — if not too severe. An Illinois 
woman says: — 

**My husband used coflFee for twenty- 
five years and almost every day. 

''He had a sour stomach (dyspepsia) 
and a terrible pain across his kidneys 
a good deal of the time. This would 
often be so severe he could not 
straighten up. His complexion was 
a yellowish-brown color. The doctors 
said he had liver trouble. 

'*An awful headache would follow 
if he did not have his coflfee at every 
meal, because he missed the drug. 

"I tried to coax him to quit coffee, 
but he thought he could not do with- 
out it. Our little girl three years old 
sat by him at table, and used to reach 
over and drink coffee from papa's cup. 
She got like her father, — ^her kidneys 
began to trouble her. 

**0n accotmt of the baby I coaxed 
my husband to get a package of Postum. 
After the first time he drank it, he had 
a headache and wanted his coffee. We 
had some coffee in the house, but I 
hid it, and made Postum as strong as 
I could, and he thought he was having 
his coffee, and had no headaches. 

''In one week after using Postum 
his color began to improve, his stomach 
got right, and the little girl's kidney 
trouble was soon all gone. My hus- 
band works hard, eats hearty, and 
has no stomach or kidney trouble any 
more. After he had used Postum a 
month, without knowing it, I brought 
out the coffee. He told me to throw 
it away." Name given by Postum

ferments, each of which has a definite 
function to perform in bringing about 
the changes which fit food to be as- 
similated by the body or eliminated 
from it. Among these ferments are 
trypsin, which curdles milk, amylop- 
sin, which finishes in the intestines

Diet and Food in Relation to 
Strength and Power op En- 
durance. By Alexander Haig. 
Cloth. Price Si. Philadelphia: P. 
Blakiston's Son & Co. 
This is a scientific woric, — a dis- 
cussion of the diet problem by an 
expert. The author holds that "diet, 
as at present used, is the product of a 
vast amount of ignorance. It is the 
cause of a hideous waste of time and 
money; it produces mental and moral 
obliquities, destroys health and- short- 
ens life, and generally quite foils to 
fulfil its proper purpose." Again he 
remarks: "It is scarcely an exaggera- 
tion to say that many matters which 
agitate the pubUc mind are not worth 
a thought in comparison with this 
subject to which a thought is seldom 
given. Yet a little consideration should 
demonstrate that what a man thinks 
he becomes, and that a science which 
controls the building of brain-cell, and, 
therefore, of mind-stufE, lies at the root 
of all the problems of life. For mind 
is a function of the body, and the body 
is dependent on the material at its 
disposal for the purpose of stabiUty 
and renewal. Hence it is obvious that 
each power must be dwarfed or distorted 
when the instrument of its manifesta- 
tion is impaired." It is the author's 
firm belief that in adopting the stimu- 
lative forms of diet the race entered 
upon a path which could lead only, as

Food Matkbiaw and their Adul- 
terations. By Ellen H. Richards. 
Cloth. Price %\. Boston: Whit- 
comb & Barrows. 

The rapid change of conditions in the 
food problem is given as the reason 
why this Uttle book has been revised 
and rewritten. The original aim of 
the author was to arouse women pro- 
viders for their famiUes to the need of 
a study of the materials they pur- 
chased, both from a sanitary and 
economic point of view. This study 
is far more important now, since, while 
women have slept, the manufacturer 
kept wide-awake and has employed 
the chemist to help him impose' upon 
the ignorant and credulous housekeeper. 
To-day, with the establishment of 
State and city laboratories, nearly 
every householder can find the infor- 
mation that she needs by a visdt to 
one of these laboratories or in printed 
reports. For the sake of her children 
the author urges the housewife and 
mother to keep herself informed of 
the true state of food manufacture. 
"Do not accept all sensational head- 
lines, but yourself study and give your

courage your gtx>cer to provide honest

but on what can these be better spent 
than en that which gives health and

holds a great deal of useful information 
in little space. 

Mrs.* Mary D. Chambers, who is well 
known to the readers of this magazine 
through her series of "Lessons in Cook- 
ery and Food Economy" published 
in these pages, has just begun her work 
as Instructor in Chemistry and Home 
Economics at Rockford College, Rock- 
ford, 111. Mrs. Chambers is also head 
of the department in which students 
are trained as teachers of Home Eco- 
nomics. 

This college is of very hi^ rank 
educationally, being classed by Com- 
misaoner Harris as one of the ten in- 
stitutions of first rank in the United 
States for the higher education of 
women, and, as such, it is the pioneer 
in introducing the subject of Home 
Economics into its curriculum. 

Mrs. Chambers was formerly con- 
nected with Millikin University, De- 
catur, 111., to which place she went 
after several years' work as Instructor 
at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, N.Y. 

We are in receipt of the prospectus of 
Miss Miller's School of Cookery, Harri- 
son Street, Kansas City, Mo. Demon- 
stration lectures are given to house- 
keepers and cooks. Practice classes 
are arranged for housekeepers, cooks, 
misses, children, and nurses. Courses 
in serving and marketing are provided, 
as is also a course confined to the mak- 
ing of salads and desserts. In her very 
attractive circular. Miss Miller says 
attention is paid to the selection of 
supplies with reference to economy 
and utility, thus tending to develop 
personal interest in marketing and the 
details of economical and scientific 
housekeeping.

express a longing for pie. I know oDe 
Ainerican family, settled down to house- 
keeping in London, who had a dozen 
pie plates sent over from this country, 
in order that they might indulge in 
that popular dish. (A pie plate can- 
not be bought in England.) This re- 
minds me that during a conversation 
with an English friend I referred to pie, 
and he declared that he had heard 
much of the article, and was curious 
to taste it; that, if I could tell his wife 
how it was made, we would enjoy its 
juicy delidousness. My knowledge of 
its manufacture was extremely limited, 
to an occasional sight of the work in 
progress at home; but the good lady 
grasped the problem at a glance, as 
it were, saying it differed from the 
tart only in the amount of filling and 
the under cmst. 

The next day I was invited to dine 
with them : soup, jugged hare, broiled 
fresh pork, greens, onions, and Brus- 
sels sprouts, — that was English in 
every line. For dessert the pie (?). 
We had discussed it in all its aspects 
before it was brought to the table; 
and, when it was set before my hostess, 
she confessed that she could not obtain 
a plate such as I had described, but had 
used what she thought would answer 
the purpose. It was a small shallow 
vegetable dish, at the bottom of which 
had been placed a layer of dough 
about half an inch thick, almost filling 
the dish. On top of that had been 
shced two apples, and this was covered 
with a blanket of dough of the same 
thickness as the under crust. 

London is a baker's paradise. 
Bread-making seems to be a lost art 
with the housekeepers of the metropolis. 
It would be interesting to know the 
number of families that make their 
own bread. Yeast in any form is al- 
most unknown. However, the baker 
always is to be depended upon, and 
the variety of bread, from the ugly-

looking, rotmd workingman's loaf to 
the dainty French roll, is almost mi- 
limited. But the way it is carted 
roimd the streets would shock a New 
England housewife. Almost "any old 
thing" in the shape of a vehicle answers 
the purpose of conveying it from bak- 
ery to customer: push-carts, coster- 
wagons, tricycles, etc., are called into 
service; and the loaves are piled up 
in the open, like so much cord-wood, 
and carried, hugged in the arms of the 
dirt-begrimed driver, to the kitchen. 
Many times I have seen a loaf fall to 
the greasy, muddy street, to be picked 
up and polished on the sleeve of the 
driver. 

Milk is delivered much as we handle 
kerosene. A great brass tank is fas- 
tened to a push-cart or some other form 
of vehicle. At the bottom of this tank 
is a faucet through which the milk is 
drawn into tins of various capacity 
that dangle from the sides of the wagon. 
In some cases the tank is sunk in the 
wagon, and the fluid is ladled out or 
bailed out with one of the tins. Imag- 
ine the condition of those wide-mouth 
cans after several hotirs' exposure to 
rain or dust! I have frequently seen 
the tTiilVrnftn wash his tin with milk 
before filling it for the customer. 

Fruit is not nearly so good as we have 
in New England. I refer to the ordi- 
nary quality. Of com-se, you can get 
fancy stock, but the price is exorbitant. 
For instance, in a store in Regent 
Street, I have seen apples at one shilling 
each; peaches at one shilling and six- 
pence; strawberries, twelve in a box, 
at six shillings; oranges, one shilling; 
pineapples, eight shillings; and grapes 
at six to ten shillings per pound. But, 
taking the cost, even in excess of what 
is paid here, the fruit was inferior. 
The bananas come from the Canary 
Islands, and were small and very 
sweet. Oranges from France were 
small, with tough fibre and large seeds, 
while the apples generally are inferior.

Baldwin or pie apples were sold for 
table fruit. 

But these are observations in Lon- 
don and some of tbe larger cities. It 
is quite different in rural England, a 
garden spot of earth. 



Rev. Edward A. Horton told this 
story at a banquet of the Ancient and 
Honorable Artillery Company. A 
woman went marketing in Faneuil 
Hall. She stopped before a stall where 
fowl were displayed. "What do you 
sell those for?" inquired the woman, 
wondering if the proprietor would date 
call them chickens. "We usually sell 
them for profits, marm," was the curt 
response. "Oh," said the woman, "I 
thought they were patriarchs." 



An excited individual ran up to a 
porter at a railway station, and asked, 
"Have you seen a parcel I left on this 
seat?" The porter replied that he had 
not. "Oh, what shall I do?" ex- 
claimed the excited passenger: "it 
contains three poems I have written!" 
"Can't you write them again?" asked 
the unsympathetic porter. "Yes, I 
can do that, but [hesitatingly] there 
were two sandwiches in the parcel as 
well." — Christian World.

Dinner to Napoleon Copied even 
to Menu 

At a cookery exhibit held in Paris an 
interesting feature was the reproduc- 
tion of a dinner offered to Napoleon I. 
exactly one hundred years before by 
Prince Talleyrand, his famous foreign 
minister. 

It was an elaborate repast for twenty- 
six persons, and the original menu of 
i8o6, prepared by Talleyrand's famous 
cook, Careme, was faithfully followed. 
The pots and pans used and the table 
upon which the dishes were prepared 
were actually the same as used at 
Talleyrand's house a htmdred years 
ago. 

A Kansas City woman, says the Kan- 
sas City Times, tells this story of her 
husband. One morning he glanced 
at the dining-room clock, and said, "We 
must be later than usual this morning." 
"Don't place too much confidence in 
that clock. It stopped at five o'clock, 
and I just set it by guess," replied the 
good wife. "Were you up at five 
o'clock?" asked the husband. "Of 
course not." "If you weren't up at 
five," replied the man, puzzled, "how 
do you know when the clock stopped ?' * 
"Why, dear, it stayed stopped," was 
the reply. The man did not say another 
word that morning.

Noah was the founder of 
indigestion — He for- 
got to leave the 
pigs ashore 



and the American people in con- 
sequence have ever since been 
victims of lard cooked food and 
indigestion. 

Lard soaked food is not £t for 
human stomachs because lard is 
made from greasy, indigestible hog 
fat, and is bound, sooner or later, 
to make trouble for your inner 
machinery. 

Cottolene is the only rational, 
national shortening. It is a pure 
vegetable product and its source 



(the cotton fields of the Sunny 
South) is in striking contrast with 
the source of lard (the pig-sty). 
Cottolene is a clean, wholesome pro- 
duct that makes food palatable, nu- 
tritious and healthful, and food that 
any stomach can digest. If Ameri- 
can housewives but knew the super- 
iority of Cottolene over lard, both 
from a practical and health stand- 
point, lard would never again enter 
any well regu- 
lated kitchen.

A Chinese Christmas Tree 

By Jessie Juliet Knox 
Author of ^^Little Almond Blossoms'^ 



IF a Christmas tree is delightful to 
American people, who have had 
an intimate acquaintance with the 
festivities of Yule-tide since childhood, 
and thoroughly understand all the 
stereotyped ways of celebrating this 
happy time, try and imagine what a 
Christmas tree would mean to a crowd 
of heathen women and children upon 
seeing it for the first time. 

In all the larger towns of California 
there are the Chinese quarters, or 
'* Chinatowns." Upon the streets one 
may always see a great many Chinese 
men and boys. They are privileged 
because of their sex; but a stranger 
would not know that these men and 
boys have mothers, wives, and sisters 
hidden away in the dark and mysterious 
recesses of Chinatown, because they 
are too precious to be exposed to the 
gaze of the common herd, and so are 
kept behind bolts and bars, sometimes 
where never a sunbeam can find its 
wav. 

It is onlv the women of low class who 
have the' freedom of the streets. To 
be a real lady of high caste means al- 
ways to be a prisoner. The magic key 
that opens the door to these prisons is 
Love. Very few have the key. The 
very largest key of Ipve, we think, is 



owned by the noted Donaldine Cameron, 
rescuer of Chinese slave-girls in the 
city of San Francisco. 

And we are glad that we also have a 
little key, for, if we had not, our delight- 
fully unique Christmas tree could never 
have been given, and forty-five heathen 
hearts would have missed being happy 
and free for a few hours. 

The city of San Jos6, Cal., has 
its Chinatown; and we, being filled 
with an overwhelming love for the 
Chinese people, and having made a 
study of them for eight years and 
become a really and truly pong yow 
(good friend), conceived the idea of at 
least making the effort to give the 
Chinese women and children a Christmas 
tree. None knew better than we the 
difTerence between inviiing them to 
come and having them really come. 
We look back now and wonder at our 
boldness, and how we could ever have 
believed they would really come. Not 
but that they wished to come. Oh, 
yes! Every one of them would have 
given anything in the world to be 
present; but a Chinese woman is so 
accustomed to having no will of her 
own, and to having it dinned into her 
ears that she must never be seen and 
must stay shut up like a bird in a cage. 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



that this seemed the most terrible 
undertaking imaginable. 

No free American woman could 



Girls in Chincte Miuion 

possibly have the least idea what a 
venture this would be to a timid little 
Chinese lady. It was overpowering, and 
they just could not get up the courage 
to ask permission of their liege lords. 
But here the key of love began to work ; 
and, taking that responsibility from 
them, we txildly approached the stern 
lords of the manor, used every argument 
imaginable, met diplomacy with diplo- 
macy, and — won the day! At least, 
'they all promised, but still — we could 
not believe. 

When we had time to think, we paused 
in affright. How could we ever have 
had the assurance to think for a mo- 
ment thai such a thing could be done? 
It never had been done. But the 
Chinese are a grateful people, and now 
did not forget who had been their 
friend, and who had stood by them in 
trouble of all kinds for so many years. 
When they thought of all the things 
that love had done for them, they could 
not refuse. 

Christmas Day dawned as beautifully 
as if it knew the dear little Chinese 
women were not accustomed to battling 
with the elements, and could not have 
ventured out if it had stormed. It 
was a typical California Christmas, — 



balmy as spring, the air full of the song 
of birds and the delicate perfumes of 
winter flowers. 

We could not have the pleasure of 
receiving our Chinese guests, but then 
one could not expect everything. They 
had all told us they could not come 
unless we came after them; and, as 
that was the only way, we went. Fear 
still tugged at our heart, though, for 
we realized more and more the magni- 
tude of the undertaking. 

We went earlv, for generally the 
Chinese people are not punctual. Upon 
reaching the first home, we could have 
cried aloud for joy. There must he 
some mistake! There were the "little- 
footed" ladies — the crtitif de la crime 
of Chinese aristocracy — dressed as elab- 
orately as if for a court function, and 
their dimpled, tea-rose children jumping 
around like bits of rainbows, and squeal- 
ing with delight. This was too good 
to be tnic. Surely, the opium goddess 
must have filled my brain with visions. 
Ah! now we could make the rounds 



Oriental Lovelint

with a light heart. Up ladders and 
down into cellars we went, through 
gambling- houses and into high-binders' 



High-class Children 

dens, up next the roof and every- 
where, and the key of love opened all 
the doors. 

Not one of our Chinese friends failed 
us. 

When at last, after much chattering 
and giggling, we had collected our 
forces, we started out. 

We almost extended the 
whole length of the main 
street, because they had to 
walk, Chinese fashion, one be- 
hind the other. Both hands 
were held tightly by the 
brown fingers of two pict- 
uresque tots, while others 
clutched jealously at our 
skirts. 

We had not, at first, 
thought of having any 
American people at our 
house; but the news of our 
Chinese entertainment soon 
spread, and many friends 
asked if they might come and 
take a peep, and we could not 
refuse. After all, it would 
have been selfish to shut others out 
from such a rare sight. 

As we wandered on, — the aristocrats, 
and those with young babies following 



in carriages,— we caused a great deal of 
excitement. 

The Chinamen all rushed into the 
streets, gazing at all this 
Oriental loveliness. We are 
afraid some of them, who 
were too poor to afford such 
a commodity, coveted their 
neighbors' wives at that mo- 
ment; but, at any rate, all 
were smiling, for who could 
frown on so dazzling a 
picture ? 

At last our gay procession 
arrived. The little-footed 
aristocrats were helped out 
of the carriages, and toddled 
into the house. The Ameri- 
can ladies who received for 
me were all gowned in the 
most exquisite shorn (blouses) and foo 
(trousers), which caused a great deal of 
merriment among the Celestial guests. 
All the American people had been taken 
into the large parlors, and were waiting 
in breathless expectancy the coming of 
the Chinese. 
The library was packed with Chinese 



Mother and Datigliler 

ladies. They were all pictures of Ori- 
ental loveliness, with their gay silken 
robes and jewel-decked coiffures; but 
far more beautiful were the dear little 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



tea-rose tots, giggling in true Chinese 
fashion, and running over with the 
joy of the unexplored Christmas mys- 
teries, which had never before been 
unfolded to their wondering almond 
eyes. All were arrayed in gorgeous 
silks and satins of the most vivid 
tints, having assumed their New Year 
garti in honor of this great event. 

Even before entering the door, one 
might easily see that there was some- 
thing Oriental going on inside; and 
Chinamen who happened to pass the 
house that day were consumed with 
curiosity and bent double with laughter, 
because some of the Chinese writing 
was upside down, and they could not 
understand all those New Year papers 
on an' American house. According to 
the Chinese Now Year custom, red 
papers were over the front door, and 
at the side was the omnipresent bowl 
of punks, which the Chinese keep ever 
burning for the idols. 

The reception hall was a charming 
bit of the Orient. Here Chinese em- 



broideries draped the doors, while in 
lieu of porti6res the great "dragon 
lanterns" were used, a row of them 
illuming the darkness and shedding 
their soft light over the scene. 

In the "cosey comer" was the in- 
evitable "god shelf" of the Chinese, 
where the stolid clay god was being 
honored by little bowls of food and 
wine set before him. 

Chinese cushions were on the couch, 
embroidered dragons were on the wall. 
Chinese tea sets on the table, and 
quantities of long red slips of paper, 
with Chinese names inscribed thereon. 
These are the New Year's calling cards 
of the Chinese. 

■ At all the doors were bowls of punks, 
tilling the rooms with Oriental aroma, 
and red papers were ever>where. Great 
masses of holly berries brightened the 
scene, as that is the color of "Chinese 
red," — with them the color of joy. 

When all had arrived, the doors 
were opened, and the radiant mass of 
Celestials, now feverishly expectant, 
were ushered into the mysterious 
Christmas room. 



In Rich Attire 



A Chinese Christmas Tree 



217 



Some one attempted to play a march 
for their triumphal entrance into the 
room; but, no! Heathen ears, which 
had hitherto known nothing save the 
hanging of lom-loms and the shrill 
pipings of the Chinese flageolet, could 
not keep time to the tune of civilized 
melody. 

So we personally conducted and 
guided the timid, toddling guests into 
the large rooms. At last the 
feat was accomplished, and 
now came the supreme mo- 
ment for both American and 
Chinese guests. 

If they had not smiled, 
you might never have known 
how beautiful they were; but 
now, — ah, now! — when they 
caught sight of the great, 
glittering tree of the Christ 
Child, all sparkles and light, 
they were transformed, and 
all at the same time became 
little children. For — would 
you believe it? — some of 
these delightful little heathen 
mothers, as well as all the 
children, believed — really be- 
lieved — in the existence of 
Santa Claus. 

The children were all 
seated upon the floor near the 
tree. Their great almond 
eyes sparkled with delight. 
Just think! It was the first 
time they had ever seen a 
Christmas tree! 

And now the preacher, who was the 
only Chinese man present, made a 
prayer in their own language. We did 
not understand, of course; but, then, 
it was not our tree. He spoke to 
heathen hearts, and they understood. 

The distributing of the gifts was so 
hysterically real and pathetic that we. 
being Santa Claus, had to turn aside 
and give a furtive dab at our eyes, 
and we think some tears fell into the 
wide, peacock -embroidered sleeves of 
the blouse we had donned. 



We never knew before how happy it 
makes one to give happiness to those 
who really need it. 

We had not dared invite the really 
and truly Santa Claus, for the Chinese 
women and children had told me they 
would be afraid of him, as they had 
heard he had such long whiskers. 

After the gifts had been distributed, 
the guests were invited into the dining- 



room, where things were even more 
Oriental. One felt as if entering a joss 
house (temple). One whole side of the 
room was completely covered with the 
gods which the Chinese worship. These 
are on huge paper panels, and are 
extremely showy. In front of the gods 
was the table of offerings, an exact 
representation of the one which the 
Chinese people always set before the 
idols at their New Year time. 

Everything was done just as the 
Chinese do it. The guests were then 



2l8 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



given real Chinese tea and cakes, served 
in the real Chinese way; that is, in 
tiny, handle-less bowls, without su^ar or 
cream, and poured from a teapot kept 
warm at all times by being encased in a 
padded receptacle. 

Tiny mandarin oranges, too, were 
there in abundance; for these always 
please Chinese children . Then there were 
all kinds of Chinese sweetmeats, with 
chop-sticks for those who wished them. 

Everybody fell in love with the dear 
little, timid, Chinese ladies, who have 



the sweet modesty and gentleness of a 
child, and every one wanted to cuddle 
the cunning little Chinese boys and 
girls ; and all were more than regretful 
when the sacred hour for Chinese dinner 
(four o'clock) approached, and they 
had to say good-bye to all those gayly- 
robed, dimpled, giggling tots, and see 
them toddle off on their wobbling, 
embroidered shoes, and the ladies of 
high caste roll away, — away from the 
land of Christmas, and into the realm 
of the joss. 



A Yard of Te»-n 



When sleeps the Land 



By Grace Stone Field 



Ah, me] the lonely land! 

Birds mute and Howers flown, 
And sullen waves that moan 

Upon the strand. 

The trees bereft of leaves. 

The fields where stand no sheaves, — 

Ah. me! the lonely landl 



Hush! 'tis a land asleep, 

Dreaming through Nature's night. 
To wake with spring's delight 

From slumber deep. 

Snow, spreading fold on fold, 

Soft shelters from the cold, — 

HushI 'Tis a land asleep. 



Oh, happy field and shore! 
For soon shall come again 
The robin and the wren, 
And waken you once more. 
No lonely land, but blest 
With kindly care and rest 
And plenitude in store! 



A Scientific Play-day 

By Helen Campbell 



THERE is no real play-day 
without hard work. Witness 
the small boy who travels 
miles for a day's fishing, and, once at 
the spot, will lie motionless for hours, a 
possible trout the incentive, but the 
result a perch or two or a stray shiner. 
The fun abides, however, no less than 
when older, but still bent on play, he 
trains for football or the college crew. 
And so the scientific man, juggling with 
earth, air, fire, and water, burned, 
drenched, or blown up, comes down 
smiling, for a new result is his; and 
what is man for but to find them? 

The agricultural chemist comes under 
this head; and the day nears — ^is even 
here — ^when the farmer is to know, as 
never before, which of all the products 
of his own labor has most power to 
give a man fuel for those inward fires 
that run the machine we call the human 
body. 

Here, then, was the searcher, finder, 
tester, — ^the agricultural chemist and 
his laboratory. On the table before 
him a stout tube, some eight inches 
long and four in diameter, made of 
solid steel, save for a little cavity lined 
with platinum, in which he had put a 
small brown pellet, as much like a cough 
drop or an old-fashioned pill as any- 
thing. In actual fact it was a Hubbard 
squash, — a condensed squash, the 
chemist said almost apologetically, as 
he gazed at it and one of its brethren, 
a drop of water on its polished siuiace, 
symbolizing the tear it would naturally 
shed at such ending of a summer's 
conflict with squash bugs and all other 
natural and unnatural foes of true 
squash development. 

A powerful lever was a part of the 
apparatus at hand, and with this he 
had gradually compressed the vege- 
table, or a large part of it, into this 
mere pellet, In the centre of the 



bomb — ^for that is the singular title 
given to the little cavity — ^is suspended 
a thread-like wire of pure iron; and 
the cap of the bomb was screwed on 
carefully, then placed in a pail of 
water holding a thermometer graduated 
so delicately that the thousandth of a 
degree could be measured. Then the 
electric battery was called upon, the 
current turned on, and the iron wire, 
taking instant fire, burned down to the 
squash pellet, which in turn was con- 
sumed, the heat made in burning pass- 
ing out through the steel walls and 
warming the water, the degree of heat 
being recorded on the thermometer, — 
a mere hint of heat, to be sure, but 
recorded as accurately as if it had been 
a test of the fire in San Francisco. 

This small and, it would seem, pre- 
posterously absurd method with squash 
was to prove precisely how much fuel 
its substance held for the eater; in 
other words, its precise value as food, 
since the same heat, registered on the 
little thermometer, is that it would give 
off to the human body. The tube also 
had its own scientific name, — a bomb 
calorimeter; and the calorie, as all 
food students know it, is just a unit of 
meastu'e, the amount of heat necessary 
to raise the temperatiu-e of a pound of 
water four degrees by Fahrenheit or 
one and eight-tenths degrees by the 
Centigrade thermometer. Precisely as 
a lump of coal holds the latent heat 
that warms us or cooks our food, so 
each thing we eat has its latent heat, 
given out to the body as it is digested; 
and the tiny bomb measured it with 
an infallible exactitude. 

The little bomb and the non-protest- 
ing squash are one phase, but now the 
chemist grows more ambitious. The 
bomb expands, and it is no longer a 
squash or meek turnip that it holds, 
but a man, who, though he is not 



210 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



reduced to a pellet and consumed, goes 
through tests almost as heroic. The 
bomb has become a room, copper-lined 
instead of steel, its name the respiration 
calorimeter ; and in this room the tenant 
abides a given number of days, a week, 
or even a fortnight, and the most 
absolutely accurate data and records 
are kept, including not only the food 
given him, its composition, etc., but 
eveiy atom of waste, — ^how much food 
is left unconsumed as it comes from 
the intestines and kidneys, and how 
much is given oflf through the lungs in 
breathing. There is record also of 
every atom of muscular energy used, 
and every movement of the body 
generating some heat. A stationary 
bicycle is in the room, — ^a very small 
one, seven and a half by four feet in 
dimensions and six and a half feet 
high. Outside the room is a thermom- 
eter so sensitive that it records any 
fraction of a degree of heat. The ob- 
server outside, who keeps the record, 
needs neither to look in nor to hear a 
sound from the man inside as he rises 
from his chair, for even this act, 
which holds next to no exertion, 
causes instantly a rise in the ther- 
mometer. 

The air he breathes is the next con- 
sideration. It goes in to him abso- 
lutely pure. It comes out impure from 
the breathing process, and the impurity 
is measured by another delicately ad- 
justed apparatus. There may be also 
muscular tests or no muscular work at 
all, the man merely doing mental labor, 
light or severe, as the case may be, 
whichever is necessary to determine 
the value of the foods given and their 
efficiency for rest or action. And it all 
ends as one of the most important 
scientific demonstrations of the century. 
This long series of experiments demon- 
strate that no atom of energy, force, or 



matter is at any time lost, but that 
each and all are to be accounted for. 
The Pennsylvania Experiment Station 
is doing much the same thing with 
cattle, thus settling the vexed question 
as to stock foods. 

The professor rubs his hands joyfully 
as each new test shows the minute 
faithfulness of his methods; but he 
groans as he states that it is the cooking, 
guaranteed to ruin the most carefully 
selected food, that makes the problem 
of American diet. The richest food 
supply the earth owns is, for the ma- 
jority, he believes, so wretchedly cooked 
that the national dyspepsia is made 
inevitable ; but he rejoices in the steady 
march of the cooking school no less 
than in the general knowledge embodied 
in the agricultural bulletins and sent 
out to any applicant. Through his 
work has come also what is known as 
the sugar test and its determining of 
the value of sugar as food, the result of 
this being the sending of tons on tons 
of pure candy and chocolate to our 
army in the Philippines. Sugar he 
records definitely, after long experi- 
ment, is a very powerful stimulant for 
those in the midst of exhausting physical 
strain, as it is quickly and thoroughly 
assimilated, and enables the eater to 
pull through the crisis, even when 
strength and endtu'ance are taxed to 
the utmost. 

With Burbank creating steadily new 
forms of food, delicious to taste and 
fair to the eye, and oiu* chemist play- 
ing with his bomb and settling their 
actual value to mankind, the day nears 
when even the least scientific cook 
must have some inkling of a better 
way; and the generation to come will 
forget the meaning of pill, powder, or 
any other death-dealing result of our 
own transgressions in the way of bad 
cookery. 



Christmas Diary of a Young Girl 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



December 25, 1898. — Now I am twelve 
years old, I am going to keep a diary 
about Christmas as it comes along. 
It is not half so nice as some other 
days. You don't always get what you 
want, but you have to do a lot of pre- 
tending you had rather have it than 
anything else. Writing your thanks 
is just awful. It takes so many people 
put together to give me just one real 
nice present that Christmas things 
don't count up much. 

The best fun in Christmas is getting 
ready for it. I begin on the next one 
just as soon as one is over. I pick 
out the things I wish I had not got, and 
keep them to give away next year. 
Now I am so big I write down who 
gives them to me, because once I 
gave back to Aunt Jane's Lucy Ann 
the very pocket-book she had given 
me, and she got real mad. When 
I have a little girl, I shan't give her 
useful things. I shall buy her a dia- 
mond necklace and a long white 
feather, and I shan't call it just a trifle, 
as Aunt Jane does when she gives me 
a pin-ball. I hate pin-balls. 

January i, 1900. — I forgot to write 
about Christmas before last, for it 
did not amount to much. We did not 
give anybody much of anything, and 
we got all tired out making jokes. We 
just each of us gave our best present 
to mamma. We liked her best, and she 
was so surprised. Then we put to- 
gether all we had not spent and what 
we did not want, and gave that to some 
children whom we did not know very 
well. 

Well, that was a year and one week 
ago. Then came last Christmas, I 
mean the one a week ago, and papa was 
so sick we forgot what day it was. 

After he had died, mamma opened his 
secretary, and there was a little package 



in it for each one of us, just what each 
of us most wanted. And there was a 
little note for each of us, too, and a note 
for mamma. She just read otu* notes, 
and then she took hers and went off 
by herself, and, when she came back 
she looked all beautiful and blushing, 
just like a bride. I am going to put 
my note with my best handkerchiefs 
and learn it by heart. It was the 
sweetest, saddest, dearest Christmas 
that ever was. 

December 25, 1901. — It seems a 
great deal longer than just one Christ- 
mas ago. We live so differently since 
papa died. We don't get cross with 
each other, as we used to, and we all 
help at home, which we didn't use to 
do, either. We girls got the Christmas 
dinner. We were so glad to get any 
kind of a present we didn't mind its 
being useful. I did mind, though, not 
being able to give nice things, but I 
had to make the kind you buy at fairs, 
and give those instead. Christmas, 
the way we had it, takes the pride all 
out of you. You just feel grateful 
things are not worse, and you don't 
want anybody to feel very bad, for 
you are glad on what mamma calls 
general principles and for wholesale 
reasons, and are not on the lookout 
for special providences for your own 
benefit, she says. 

December 26, 1902. — I didn't know 
there was so mudi fun in economical 
Christmases till we had them our- 
selves. Just having a jolly time out 
of nothing but love is more substantial 
than I supposed. Saving all through 
the year for the sake of Christmas 
giving keeps you inventing. If you 
feel a bit mean because )'^ou have to 
contrive so much to do anything, you 
feel mighty proud when you have 



121 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



thought of a way by which, after all, 
you can save and have. It is the hav- 
ing in the end that makes the saving 
come easv. 

We have given up Christmas trees, 
— better for the woods that we did. 
We have given up window wreaths and 
ribbons. We just put laurel round 
father's picture. We take turns in 
giving presents. We go to see two 
or three persons who don't have nice 
Christmases, and we have fun watch- 
ing people on the streets with their 
bundles. We all are earning a little 
or getting ready to do so, and we call 
saving earning. Mamma says Christ- 
mas overdoing makes one forget its 
real meaning. 

December 26, 1905. — It is three years 
since I wrote in this book. When I 
began, I supposed it would not be large 
enough for all I should have to say, 
but now just living along has got too 
big for any diary, and a Christmas 
feeling stays with me all the time. It 
is so nice that Christmas never fails 
to put in its appearance right on 
time. It is in one way the whole year, 
not once a year. Everything that has 
happened makes it seem more real. 
It did not begin to be so until papa 
died. Then mamma taught us that, 
when one loves another very, ver>' 
much, one is never sorry for their 
dymg. She says she and papa are 
Uving together now. If he were my 
husband, I should want him more 
really and truly round in the house. 

I have found out, too, that it is such 
good fun to earn my own living. I 
am afraid I shall get conceited about it. 



I really don't earn much, but living at 
home is cheaper than boarding, so 
what I earn seems more. Then I 
talk like a mother to the girls who 
aren't as old as I, and tell them there 
is always a niche in the world some- 
where for everybody. It is just a 
game of hide-and-seek, and the Christ- 
mas feeling is like the loud music in 
the play of magic music, which lets 
you know when you are close on to the 
thing hidden, all waiting for you to 
find it. 

I have not been married yet. I am 
not even engaged. I hope I shall be 
before another Christmas. They say 
girls have to do the chasing nowa- 
days. I shan't. It is not dignified. 
Besides, he would not be half so grate- 
ful as if he had had a hard time making 
me like him. I hope it will happen on 
a Christmas. 

December 25, 1906. — It did happen 
to-day! My! I shall have my ring 
to-morrow. He was not sure enough 
I'd say yes to get it beforehand. 

It is so nice other people have Christ- 
mas, too. It belongs to everybody. 
Mamma says after it once got started 
of itself, because Christ was bom, it 
is up to each one of us never to let the 
Christmas feeling stop. I mean the 
gladness and gratitude that comes down 
through the ages, and will go on jtist 
the same in eternity, because of that 
first Christmas two thousand years 
ago. Each Christmas is more wonder- 
ful than the last, no matter whether 
or not you are engaged. New Year's 
is good for resolutions, but Christmas 
is better for gratitude all round. 




A Christmas Cat 

By Alix Thorn 




MUST have that cat," said 
C3mthia, dreamily. 
"Cat? What cat?" I asked. 

"Why," returned my sister, stopping 
short in the busy thoroughfare, *'we 
just passed it. You saw that fascinat- 
ing creattu'e that stands upon its 
hind legs and drums." 

Then we both turned back, and 
Cj^thia bargained with the street- 
vender for a certain gray and white 
tin cat, who drummed with spirit and 
precision when wound up. Quite the 
military cat. 

**I'd love to own a real cat, if only 
we didn't live as we do," miu^mured 
Cynthia, regretfully. **I seem to need 
one. Do you know, I remember far 
back in otu* country days, when I was 
a mite of a child, I once owned a gray 
and white cat. I bestowed much 
affection upon it. It loved me in re- 
turn, too." And she gave to the box 
she carried a friendly pat. 

Now C)aithia is the kind of woman 
who seems out of place in the rush and 
din of the city streets. She has appeal- 
ing eyes and tender, appealing ways; 
and she should dwell in a sort of Cran- 
ford town, where folks "go softly all 
their days," and where no prim front- 
door yard is complete without its com- 
fortable tabby basking in the sunshine. 

**To whom are we going to give that 
cat?" I inquired. **I may be dense, 
but I somehow recall only grown-up 
friends, who would not truly appre- 
ciate such a gift, no matter how much 
spirit went with it." 

"Well," returned my sister, "I had 
to buy the cat, but I do think of some 
one who is just the age for it, little 
Margery Osborne." And then I re- 
membered our physician's small daugh- 
ter, who every Sunday, across the aisle, 
exchanged understanding smiles with 
Cynthia. 



We reached our tiny apartment late 
in the afternoon, hastened to light up, 
and set the gray and white cat upon 
the mantle. He drummed cheerfully 
while we cooked oiur modest dinner, 
he continued to drum while we ate 
it, and when, household duties done, 
we brought out cards for solitaire, we 
still heard the martial roll of the 
drum. 

At half- past eight our rector appeared 
to talk over the approaching festivities 
of the church. Though we were both 
interested in the cantata and both 
were drilling children's choruses, it 
was at Cynthia he looked; Cynthia he 
appealed to. What, with the interest 
and excitement, her cheeks grew a most 
lovely pink. 

The rector had called several times, 
and I had begun to wonder — one 
always wonders when there is a widower 
in the question — if, perhaps — To- 
night I felt sure. When I came back 
to the room, Cynthia was winding up 
the toy, and the rector's kindly, near- 
sighted eyes were studying first Cyn- 
thia and then the cat. 

"Very amusing, very," he was say- 
ing. **I like the cat myself. It gives 
a home touch. Think my cook has 
one at the rectory." The yellow shade 
made Cynthia's bright hair look yel- 
lower than usual as she bent over her 
sewing. 

When my music pupils came next 
morning, each one quickly spied the 
cat. It must be wound up, and great 
was the joy thereat. They could 
hardly be persuaded to leave it and 
take a lesson. 

In the afternoon a college friend of 
Cynthia's ran in. She, too, fell under 
the spell of the white and gray cat, and 
he did his best to entertain her. It 
was well that Christmas was near by, 
for the brave little drummer would

have been worn out before the festive 
season. We were beginning to fear 
that his arm action was growing a 
trifle weak, but hoped that his new 
mistress would discover no lack. We 
parted with him with regret. Cynthia 
looked almost mournful as she tied up 



the box with crimson ribbon and 
tucked in the accompanying sprig of 
holly. "But I bought him to give 
away/' she remarked. And my an- 
swer was, — 

"They have a live cat at the rectory, 
Cynthia." 



Suggestions for Stag Parties 

By Mary Taylor-Ross 



NEARLY every magazine one 
takes up contains hints and 
suggestions for a mixed com- 
pany of people, which is the easiest 
of all companies to entertain, or for 
women's luncheons or receptions, which 
come next; but few, indeed, are the 
helps for those who would entertain a 
stag party, although there are many 
wives who would be delighted to plan 
some sort of entertainment for their 
husbands' friends or business associ- 
ates. If one is well acquainted with the 
friends of one's husband, with their 
tastes and preferences, it is a simple 
matter to plan an evening and a meal, 
whether dinner or supper, which will in- 
clude some favorite dishes, and there is 
no use of pretending that the food 
served does not have great weight in 
making a man th nk he has spent a 
delightful evening. We might as well 
admit this at once. 

There are certain kinds of food that 
are invariably liked by men, with the 
exceptions so rare one will scarcely 
ever encounter them. Some of these 
dishes are shell fish, — oysters, dams, 
lobster (broiled live), — game of all sorts, 
beef in the shape of a fillet mignon, or, 
in the absence of a game course at 
dinner, a well-prepared roast. Fish 
dinners are generally enjoyed by men, 
although, properly speaking, what is 
known as a fish dinner would be more 



correctly called a fish supper. Beef- 
steak suppers, rabbit suppers, coon 
suppers, are all popular with men, and 
it is well to remember that most men 
prefer rather plain dishes, or what 
seems to them in appearance to be plain, 
although, as any chef knows, the very 
plain dishes, served with a sauce, are 
among the very most particular there 
are to prepare and serve ; for the sauce 
must be carefully made and perfectly 
seasoned, and it is not every cook who 
understands the making of a good 
sauce. The "plain dish" must be 
perfect, — ^the best of its kind and pre- 
pared without a flaw. As for desserts, 
save all 3'our efforts in the way of fancy 
dishes for a mixed company, and have 
a fruit pie with delicate pufF-paste 
crusts or a pudding baked or boiled 
in the nature of a roly-poly or dtunp- 
Ung, which may be individual pud- 
dings, ipade with fruit and served with 
a rich, sweet sauce. 

See that cigars are plentiful, and then 
for entertainment hire one or two per- 
sons who have some specialty in enter- 
taining, or can give a little vaudeville 
performance, dancing, singing, recit- 
ing, or * 'doing tricks," notably sleight- 
of-hand exhibitions. An athlete might 
give exhibitions of the various things 
that athletes do and which men under- 
stand and are interested in, and it is 
well to have the affair so informal .

that any of the guests will feel priv- 
ileged to "try" themselves whatever 
the entertainer may be doing. Bill- 
iards, poker, and any card games are 
very good for a few guests, but, where 
there are a large number, if any of the 
above suggestions do not serve, invite 
some one to speak on some interesting 
topic of the day or to give a little talk 
that rambles on (though not too long), 
touching several topics of interest. 

The dinner or supper is given first, 
a ' "smoker" follows, and then the guests 
themselves may give little talks, hav- 
ing been given a slip with a subject 
written on it, or the subject may be 
written on the place-card underneath 
the name. Any one who does not care 
to speak need not do so, as there will 
be no toastmaster, as at a formal 
dinner. Some chum of the host can, 
quite naturally, commence on his own 
subject, and the others follow as -they 
see fit. A discussion of the topic might 
follow each speech; and, generally, 
men thoroughly enjoy anything of 
this sort, and they like to hear them- 
selves talk quite as well as women, 
although they do not admit it. A 
debate', such as all men are familiar 
with as school-boys, is another means 
of entertaining a company composed 
wholly of men. If music is to form 
a part of the entertainment, do not 
attempt a programme of classics, but 
have some up-to-date coon songs, 
popular airs, interspersed with old- 
time ballads. Music of this sort will 
prove a strong card, for it is perfectly 
permissible to keep on talking while 
it is being played, when music from the 
masters would entail sitting perfectly 
quiet and listening until bored beyond 
expression. Have an Orchestra, if pos- 
sible, even though a very small one. 



and generally some member of an 
orchestra can sing a little, — enough 
to render ragtime songs and ballads. 
Or a phonograph (not too dose to 
the table) may be kept plajang all 
through the supper; and under cover 
of the music even the shyest and 
stiffest of men will lose his sense of 
restraint, and tell a good story, which 
will make the others think of some other 
story, till each one has told his own par- 
ticular story. A man always feels 
perfectly at home anywhere after he 
has had a chance to tell* his own par- 
ticular story; and what man is there 
who has not one story that he never 
tires of telling? 

A fish dinner affords each man an 
opportunity, which you may be sure 
will not be neglected, to see which can 
tell the biggest fish story of the crowd, 
— a story purporting to be of his own 
experiences and marvelous luck as a 
piscatorial artist. This also applies 
to a game supper, for there is just as 
much room for the imagination to play 
about and ''see things big" in htmting 
as in fishing,. 

The decorations and place-cards 
should have some connection with the 
kind of supper given, suitable quota- 
tions being used on the cards. At a 
dinner for physicians a bottle (un- 
mistakably a whiskey bottle) was drawn 
with pen and ink. The name was 
printed on the bottle, and, in the fonn 
of a prescription, the words "Take 
night and morning — ^and any old 
time." The cards were booklets, and 
on the inside leaf was a "trick menu" 
cleverly gotten up, everything being 
called by some other name. At the 
bottom was printed "1 feel very much 
better," — a thing all doctors like to hear 
a patient say. 




The Passing of Madame Begue's 



By Felix J. Koch 



MADAME Begue is dead. No 
more Epicurean breakfasts 
in the Quartier Latin for 
the bon-vivants of the nation. No 
more snails d la Creole, or artichokes 
d la Begue, or the thousand-and-one 
curious palate-ticklers that one could 
get nowhere else west of Paris. Ma- 
dame Begue- is dead, and the queer 
little two-story structure on the French 
market-place, with the yellow concrete 
over the exterior, and painted on that, 
in Creole fashion, the single word 
*'Begue's," is silent and desolate. 

Back, however, from memory's 
treasure-house you are recalling your 
breakfast at Begue's. Begue's was 
more than a restaurant, more than a 
cabaret: it was an institution of New 
Orleans. Everybody went, at least 
once, on each visit to the city, to dine 
there. Such was the fame of the place 
that one had to engage places long 
in advance or run the risk of a refusal. 

Five minutes to eleven you as- 
cended the steep little stair, where 
a darky mammy was cleaning the land- 
ing, and entered a low-ceilinged room. 
The lower half of the wall was of rather 
plain panelHng, painted a rich dark 
brown. Above that the wood-work 
of the walls was in green, pierced 
by the latticed French windows. 
The room, in fact, was hard to describe, 
it was so irregular. Above the tall 
baseboard arrangement hung pictures 
of famous Frenchmen. These were in 
the usual heavy French frames. Be- 
tween the pictures hung coats-of-arms 
of famous visitors. 

You took your place, and they passed 
about an autograph and sentiment 
book, in which others had written. 
Then old man Begue, a typical French- 
man, bald, fat, and jolly, passed the 
bread. It was cut the thickness of 
three ordinary slices, and one broke it. 



never cut it. Somehow or other he 
reminded you of a Chinaman in his an- 
tics as he explained. 

When you were not watching him, 
you surveyed the table. It had a 
thick linen cloth, of plain pattern. 
At each place there were a black-han- 
dled knife and fork, a glass into which 
he put the ice, and a finger-bowl. 

Then came the first course, shrimps 
you believed they were. The guests 
wondered just how to eat them. Mr. 
Begue showed you. You break them 
open, and eat the tail only. They were 
not shrimps: they were crayfish. It 
was now 11.15. 

You finished these, and took ob- 
servations. On the table there was 
a bottle of wine for each guest, and 
the white-rock bottles were passing 
constantly. There were platters of 
butter, to which one helped himself. 
Down at the rear end of the room you 
could see the hat-rack and a little side 
table. There sat Madame Begue. 
You hadn't noticed her before, much 
as you had heard of her. She was 
talldng back and forth with her hus- 
band. She was a German by birth, 
and he, the Frenchman, was evidently 
the boss. Nevertheless, she knew 
just how to gel back at him. Mean- 
time, while the tit-for-tat went on, 
she prepared things for the next meal. 
She was getting old, — she was seventy- 
five or six when she died, — so she sat 
throughout your breakfast, with her 
crutch at her side, and just before a 
shelf with specimens of her glassware. 
Above and behind her opened a 
room where cooking was in progress. 
Your eyes wandered thence, while you 
waited or took more white rock; for 
your companions were principally 
tourists, and conversation languished. 

Then came the second cotuse, an 
omelette, with parsley, steaming hot

and fine. The waiter was a plain 
French gargon, in the usual cabaret 
apron. In the omelette you noticed 
odd bits of black spice, and detected 
a curious flavor. You questioned 
old Madame Begue, as she ate hers at 
the side table, but she shrugged her 
shoulders and laughed. Her hus- 
band, who ate at table with you, 
laughed likewise. You noticed she 
was dressed in French fashion, — ^white 
skirt, black waist, black shawl, and 
the hair parted ofif from a heavy shell 
comb. Again she called to her hus- 
band, and he rose to count the guests, 
that there be not thirteen at the tabfe. 
Then they passed celery and radishes. 

Some one wanted her to come and 
sit next to them. No, she preferred 
her place at the fireside, where it was 
warm. There, too, she could hold the 
confab with her husband in the long 
wait between courses. Around the 
table, set now for ten, the wine then 
went, to distract you. Then came the 
next course. 

Some said it was tripe, others snails. 
It was a yellow, rather ridged, — a long 
slice of something, in a yellow pep- 



pered sauce. It really proved to be 
tripe. What the spices that gave the 
gamey taste might be, no one could 
guess. 

The sun came out on the hitherto 
silent assemblage, and provoked them 
to conversation. One lady asked for 
water, and the astonished gargon says: 
** Plain water? Yes, ma'am!" Then 
with the fried chicken and the fried 
boiled potatoes, and the cigars of some 
of the gentlemen, a running chat be- 
gins. 

It is 12.10 when the next course 
enters. Half a tomato, with parsley 
on top, steaming; a piece of beefsteak, 
and, on the rim of the plate, some cress. 
After that Roquefort and Swiss cheese, 
which M. Begue cuts for each. With it 
go apples. There is, cafi rwir, into 
which he pours brandy, and then bums 
it. The meal is at an end. 

You pay a dollar, and register your 
sentiments. There are souvenir spoons 
and cook-books for sale. Or you may 
photo the old couple. But you are 
too heavy and satiate to bother. You 
simply idle on out, to continue the 
sight-seeing. 



At a lunch party the other day one 
of the young women, to show her skill 
at throwing straight, sent two butter 
balls flying into the air, both hitting a 
projection in the ceiling, where they 
remained until the heat of the room 
caused them to fall. This performance 
may prove her to be a capital shot, but 
the generality of hostesses would prefer 
other missiles than greasy butter should 
be chosen. But the manners of the 
present day stick at nothing, not even 
the butter ball, or snapping salted 



almonds at plate-glass mirrors or trials 
of manual strength on fragile gold fur- 
niture. Modem society has a singular 
taste for rough house stunts, showing 
the utmost ingenuity in damaging 
things just for the pleasure of it. Prob- 
ably Dr. Janet would say it is only 
another evidence of the all-prevailing 
hysteria which has taken our ultra- 
civilization by the ear. It reminds one 
rather of Dr. Watts's hymn about Satan 
and idle hands, though of course it won't 
do to say so aloud. — Boston Herald. 



Moravian Candy 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



EVERY section of our vast coun- 
try has its special crops, likewise 
its favorite method of preparing 
staples, or luxuries, or accessories, of 
the table. There is now a tendency 
to estimate rightly the cookery of 
"ye olden tyme," just as we now value 
the mahogany, pewter, and old books 
that a generation or so ago were so 
often sent to auction-rooms, to give 
place to machine-made black walnut, 
etc. 

In many places some noted house- 
keeper's recipes become valuable in 
trade. Often some plain old woman's 
skill is allowed to perish, because 
no one has learned her methods or 
kept her recipes for game pies, waffles, 
etc. Often people of the latter class 
were more skilled in making savory 
dishes than in teaching others or 
in writing down their knowledge. 

"Straws show how the wind blows." 
The ready sale of church-fair cook- 
books, the popular breakfasts or sup- 
pers of some towns, the jams and 
candies of other localities, indicate that 
we are trying to hold on to the best of 
the old ways, while trying to improve 
daily on many new ways; and, besides, 
we enjoy quantities of daintily prepared 
food-stuifs and tropical fniits of which 
our ancestors never dreamed. Stoves 
and utensils have been invented, and 
gas and electric lighting, while people 
who are still active remember cooking 
done by open fires and going to the 
neighbor's for coals, when tinder was 
used instead of matches or an electric 
button, as nowadays. 

In Pennsylvania the Moravian sisters 
made candy, — "the Moravian nuns 
of Bethlehem," as they are called by 
I/>ngfellow in his poem on "Pulaski's 
Banner." 

This candy is still made at the Sisters' 
House, and is for sale in Philadelphia, 



and advertised as one of their special- 
ties by fashionable grocers. "Original 
Moravian Candies, Peppermint, Spice, 
and Teaberry. In one-pound boxes. 
Made, at the 'Sisters' House, Bethle- 
hem, Pa.,' as they have been for the 
past fifty years." 

Another candy made at Lancaster, 
Pa., is said to be the same as "Mammy 
Benders," when she kept a little shop 
there. 

' It is like "salt-water taflfy," so popu- 
lar at Atlantic City, on the "Board 
Walk," — ^a white-pulled, rather crisp 
candy, cut in sihall pieces and rolled 
in wax paper. The odd thing about 
this Lancaster candy is that it is 
flavored with spearmint. 

Since mint is on the top wave of 
popularity, try it, for flavoring candy, 
as well as peppermint. And, by the 
way, spearmint and peppermint leaves 
can be crystalized very nicely and in- 
expensively at home, and are quite the 
proper thing to set oflf a dish of bonbons 
as well as the long-used rose and 
violet petals. 

Letitz pretzels are a Pennsylvania 
specialty, but here people like pretzels 
even without a thought of beer to go 
with them, and cheese. 

In some places a pretzel-seller would 
find as little demand for his wares as a 
pork -seller in Jerusalem, but in Phila- 
delphia street-venders sell them to 
workingmen, and school children buy 
them at lunch-rooms, both the tiny and 
the large varieties. 

Now that people travel so much, they 
desire souvenirs that are not trashy, — 
something to send or carry to family 
and friends. Heed this suggestion, 
and make your town noted not only 
for its "Arts and Crafts Society," but 
for its edibles. Revive, if you can, the 
potmd cake, with citron or almonds, 
the jumbles, turnovers, blanc-mange.

jams, caraway-seed, cassia and clove 
candies, the pandowdies, maple sugar- 
seasoned dishes, like custards, and cakes 



with maple sugar frosting. Who ever 
makes honey cakes? Yet we import 
such from Germany. 



The Changing Seasons 

By Helen Knight Wyman 

How lovely is Spring! 'Tis the youth of the year; 
We rejoice in its coming, with skies bright and dear; 
From the first joyous bird-call, it speaks to the heart, 
And sadly we watch its fresh glory depart. 



How fair is the Summer, when birds sing all day I 
The breath of the wild-rose, the scent of the hay, 
The flush of the dawn and the magic of night, 
Each gives one an exquisite sense of delight. 



How bounteous is Autumn, in russet and gold I 
Its foliage charms us, 'tis good to behold 1 
Its fruits fill our bins, 'tis a generous timet 
Like a life that has ripened, its end is sublime. 



And now it is Winter that o'er us holds sway: 
His breath proves a tonic, his smile makes us gay. 
In the winter of age all our past we relive. 
And we hope a new spring will eternity givel 



Diet in Relation to Childhood, Sickness, 

and Old Age 



By Mary D. Chambers 



THE following papers are 
adapted from a course of ten 
lectures given to the winter 
class in Home Economics at the De- 
partment of Agriculture, Cornell Uni- 
versity, N.Y., during February, 1906. 

I. 

Modification of Diet Dependent on 

Physiological Differences between 

Child and Adult 

Introduction 

A French writer tells us there are 
two kinds of motherhood, one of blood 
and one of the care of children. Few 
women, then, may be regarded as 
wholly debarred from exercising the 
great function of the sex in nurture 
or care or teaching or love of a child. 



From simply a physical standpoint 
few subjects, perhaps none, are more 
important to study than the care and 
diet of the child. For the individual, 
during the formative period, constitu- 
tional tendencies may be overcome. 
It has even been asserted that the 
future health of the man or woman is 
often dependent on the feeding of the 
first three months. Dr. Holt says that 
in New York City an infant mortality 
averaging 26 per cent, during the first 
year of life was directly traceable to 
disorders of nutrition, while another 
writer declares that from the intelligent 
interest now being taken by mothers in 
the subject of right diet for the grow- 
ing child he expects to see develop a 
better citizenship and a nobler race. 

The present writer a short time ago 



230 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



asserted in a mixed gathering of men 
and women, for the most part teachers, 
that the best things, the most per- 
manent values in the world, are, in 
the main, controlled by women. And 
the women present greeted the state- 
ment with incredulous laughter! But 
let us see. First, woman is the great 
money-spender. Man earns the money, 
and woman spends it. It is hardly too 
much to say that the comfort and pros- 
perity of the average wage-earner 
depends on the wise use of his money 
by his women-folk. Here, then, is 
one of the accepted values of the civ- 
ilized world controlled by women. 
Again, the food for the household is 
chosen and prepared by women, and 
volumes would be needed to tell how 
much, physically, mentally, and mor- 
ally, man is helped or hurt by his food. 
Thirdly, only a woman can make a 
home, and the home is the most im- 
portant social institution. Fourthly, 
we find the greatest of all earthly val- 
ues delivered into the hands of women, 
in the bearing, nurture, and training, 
of the child. Of these four, the last 
three may be called creative values. 
Since the fruit of all education is the 
right appreciation of values, it is to 
be hoped that the higher education 
of women will include such studies as 
may foster truer ideals of womanhood, 
and that amongst these studies may be 
found the care and diet of the chUd. 

Physiou)gical Diffbrbncbs in- 
FirUENciNG Diet 

Absence of Teeth, Food requiring 
mastication, and all thickening for food 
which is not almost predigested by 
long cooking, should be omitted from 
the diet of the infant until it has at 
least six teeth. This will generally 
be at about twelve months old. A crust 
of bread or piece of zwieback may then 
be given to suck, and in general it may 
be said that the use of bread may 
begin at the age of twelve months. 

Weight of Body. It is obvious that 



the child needs less food than the adult, 
but, since it has to build as well as re- 
pair tissue, it needs more food in pro- 
portion to its size than the adult. 
Roughly speaking, an adult usfaig an 
ordinary mixed diet, including water 
and beverages, takes daily food to 
equal 5 per cent, of his body weight. 
Large infants, for the first ten weeks, 
need 15 per cent, to 19 per cent, of the 
body weight in food. Small children, 
during the same period, need 12 per 
cent, to 14 per cent. Large infants, 
from the i ith to 13th week, need 13 per 
cent, to 17 per cent, of the body weight 
in food, small infants, same period, 
II per cent, to 13 per cent. Though 
these figures are merely approximate, 
it may be readily seen that not only 
do large children need more food than 
smaller, but they need more in propor- 
tion. 

Size of Stomach. At birth the ca- 
pacity of the stomach is about i ounce; 
at two weeks old, 2 ounces; at three 
months, 4} ounces; at six months, 
6 ounces; at twelve months, 9 ounces; 
and at eighteen months, 12 ounces. 
The capacity of the average adult 
stomach is between 3-4 pints. Since 
it is highly important to avoid disten- 
tion and consequent weakening of the 
stomach walls in early life, the amount 
of each feeding should be adapted to the 
capacity of the stomach. This, in large 
children, will be proportionally greater. 

Shape of Stomach. This, in the 
young infant, is tubular, the cardiac 
portion not being well differentiated, 
thus resembling the stomach of car- 
nivora. Proteid food of animal origin 
is then indicated during early life. 

Stomach Secretion. This tends to ex- 
cess of acid, and, since solid food 
stimulates acid secretion, points to a 
liquid diet for the child. Such a diet, 
however, results in the formation of 
less bile, more putrefaction in the in- 
testine, and more wind. 

Muscular Activity. As regards the 
voluntary muscles, there is little ac- 



Diet in Childhood, Sickness, and Old Age 



231 



tivity during early infancy, hence the 
carbohydrate, or energy-yielding, food 
is demanded in smaller proportion than 
by the adult organism. 

AninuU Heat The young infant 
has not much power to manufacture 
animal heat. Its food is unstimulat- 
ing, its lung capacity small, and most 
of its time is spent in sleep. Hence 
the fats, the heat-producers, are called 
for in larger proportion than in the 
diet of more mature years. 

Osseous System. The bony tissue in 
the child is incompletely developed. 
Therefore, lime salts are essential in the 
diet. 

Weight of Blood in Proportion to 
Weight of Body, In the new-bom 
infant the total volume of the blood 
equals little more than one-twentieth 
of the body weight. In the adult it 
is about one-thirteenth. This is an- 
other reason why a liquid diet is suita- 
ble for the infant, as liquids are readily 
absorbed into the circulation, and 
tend to increase the volume of the blood. 

Pulse, Circulation, and Breathing, 
Up to the second month of life the pulse 
beats 130 to 160 times per minute. In 
the adult of average build it beats 
about 70 times per minute. In the 
newly bom the entire round of the 
circulation is accomplished in about 
twelve seconds. In the adult it takes 
about twice that time. Soon after 
birth the infant breathes forty times per 
minute or oftener: the adult breathes 
about sixteen or seventeen times per 
minute. Metabolism, therefore, in the 
child is very rapid, and, as water favors 
metabolic changes, much water is 
needed in the diet. It has been esti- 
mated that, proportionately, the infant 
needs six times as much water as the 
adult. Milk, which commonly con- 
tains 88 per cent, or 90 per cent, of 
water, is then well adapted to the re- 
quirements of infancy. 

Digestive Secretions, The saliva of 
the infant is scanty, and during the 



early months of life may be said to be 
lacking. The parotid, or chief salivary, 
glands in the newly bom weigh only 
34 grains, or less than one-thirteenth of 
an ounce. At the end of the first 
year they equal in weight very nearly 
one-fifth of an ounce; while in the 
adult these glands weigh from one-half 
to one ounce, and the amount of saliva 
secreted daily is estimated to be about 
a pint, often much more. The starch- 
digesting ferment in the pancreatic 
juice of the infant is also slow in devel- 
oping. During the first month of life 
it has no effect whatever on starch; 
during the second, very little; at the 
close of the third month its activity 
is greatly increased, but not until the 
end of the first year is it safe to ad- 
minister other than super-cooked 
starchy foods to the child. This is one 
of the most important distinctions to be 
made in the diet of the infant, and one 
frequently disregarded by ignorant 
mothers, who are unaware that for the 
digestion of the ** little bit of cake," 
or the ** morsel of mashed potato," 
which the infant swallows so greedily, 
there has been absolutely no provision 
made by nature in the matter of 
digestive fluid. It may be said that 
**the baby thrives, eats a little of every- 
thing, and gets no hurt from it." It is 
true that nature is often tolerant and 
long-suffering, but most surely will 
payment of an overdrawn account be 
exacted in the end, and at compound 
interest. Arrested development, ner- 
vous affections, impaired vitality, re- 
sulting in disease or enfeeblement 
during puberty or middle life, may be 
often directly charged to unwholesome 
feeding during the first twelve months. 
In the foregoing brief outline, it is 
hoped, enough has been given to sho\^ 
that the diet of the child is not a matter 
of arbitrary rules formulated by the 
physician, but simply a matter of con- 
formity to irrevocable physiological 
laws.

THE MONOPOLIST AND THE 
CLAIMANT 

THE day after election sensa- 
tional head-lines and exaggerated 
claims do not count for much. 
The votes have been counted: and 
these speak the truth. 

The indications are abroad in the 
land that people are becoming tired 
of the monopolist, the self-seeking as- 
pirant, and the great claimant. Time 
was when he who aspired to high po- 
sitions of trust and honor was content 
in making declaration of his prin- 
ciples and policies, and in awaiting, 
with some degree of modesty, the call 
of the people. How different it is 
to-day! The office-seeker figures as a 
reformer, the sole savior of the land. 



Instead of being presented or repre- 
sented to the people by his friends, he 
presents himself, and boasts of his fit- 
ness and claims for promotion to the 
highest places. 

We must confess that otu- S3rmpathies 
are with those who practise the more 
modest ways of earlier da^. We ad- 
mire neither the monopolist nor the 
claimant. Doing seems to us far more 
commendable than boasting and claim- 
ing. "The tongue boasteth great 
things;" but "charity vaunteth not 
itself, is not puffed up." As matters 
now stand in this enlightened age, it 
requires the intelligent and hearty co- 
operation of many good men and 
women to bring about desirable changes 
or results, either social or economic in 
nature. No single publication or par- 
tisan leader, though he claim the earth, 
can hope to take possession of and con- 
duct the same. 



THE SMOKER 

BURBANK says he cannot in- 
trust his finest tasks to the man 
who smokes even a single cigar 
a day. The nerves of such an one are 
not sufficiently steady, his powers of 
concentrated attention are not requi- 
site to perform the most delicate proc- 
esses. 

What an arraignment this of the 
tobacco habit! If it be true, — and 
who can doubt that a kernel of truth 
is disclosed therein ? — in what a shat- 
tered state must be the nerves of a mass 
of mankind ! And yet it is well known 
that the experienced employer of work- 
men is distrustful of the incessant 
smoker as well as of the habitual 
drinker, neither of whom at his best 
is the most desirable t3rpe of employee. 
Long since the business world has had 
no use for the cigarette fiend. His 
chances for promotion in any line of 
occupation are a constantly diminish- 
ing factor. 
Why will young people persist in 



Editorials

forming habits that are destined to be 
so ruinous to their future prospects 
and well-being? A strong, well-bal- 
anced physical system, unshaken by 
indulgence or excess of any kind, is of 
priceless value in life's contests. And, 
besides, it affords the most satisfactory 
and enduring happiness. That which 
menaces health, attacks the physical 
and mental capacity, is an enemy in- 
deed. In the preservation and main- 
tenance of health and strength, food 
properly selected, prepared, and par- 
taken, should be our sole reliance. 



DILIGENCE AND MIGHT 

PEOPLE of great energy are apt 
to be successful. In every line 
of effort, men and women arrive 
at the cherished goal through tireless 
industry. Diligence, capacity to work, 
then, are traits of those who win 
out in life's contests. Jay Cooke, the 
greatest financier in our Civil War, is 
thus characterized by his late biog- 
rapher. Secretary Taft and our Chief 
Magistrate are living examples of men 
of this same type of character. 

Does it not follow that young peo- 
ple, even children, should be taught 
and encouraged to do everything well ? 
Successful achievement in minor mat- 
ters prepares the way to early promo- 
tion. He who does well the tasks 
that lie nearest at hand will soon 
be called to greater opportunities. A 
saying of the wise man is, ''Whatsoever 
thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy 
might." 

According to Tolstoy, "The first con- 
dition of a good education is that the 
child should know that all he uses does 
not fall from heaven, ready-made, but 
is produced by other people's labor." 
**I beseech you," he says, "let your 
children do all they can for themselves : 
carry out their own slops, fill their own 
jugs, wash up, arrange their rooms, 
clean their boots and clothes, lay the 
table, etc. Believe me that, unim- 



portant as these things may seem, they 
are a hundred times more important 
for your children's happiness than a 
knowledge of French or of history. 
It is true that here the chief difficulty 
crops up: children do willingly only 
what their parents do, and therefore, 
I beg of you, do these things. This 
will effect two objects at once : it makes 
it possible to learn less, by fiUing the 
time in the most useful and natural 
way, and it trains the children to sim- 
plicity, to work, and to self-depend- 
ence." 

These things are not new, and may 
seem trivial, but they point the way 
to practical, useful training and suc- 
cessful attainment. 



AS I said before, God himself 
cannot make a man or woman 
^worthy of consideration except 
in the crucible of industry. 

Work is not a curse. Indolence is 
a . beastly mother, breeding no high 
purpose and no sweet sentiments, noth- 
ing but the imps of selfishness. 

Earning one's bread by the sweat 
of one's brow — ^whether on the outside 
or the inside — is not a curse. God 
help the children of the rich ! The poor 
can work. I have no patience with 
the rich loafer: I think much less of 
him than I do of the poor loafer; and 
I have no more respect for the female 
loafer than I have for the male loafer. 
A loafer is a loafer : nothing more need 
be said, nothing worse can be said. — 
Jo hn J. Lentz, 

A SHORT ROAD TO PERFECTION 

IT is the sajdng of holy men that, 
if we wish to be perfect, we have 
nothing more to do than perform the 
ordinary duties of the day well. A short 
road to perfection, — short not because 
easy, but because pertinent and in- 
telligible. As soon as a person really 
desires and sets about seeking it him- 
self, he is dissatisfied with anything 
but what is tangible and clear, and 



234 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



constitutes some sort of direction 
towards the practice of it. 

We must bear in mind what is meant 
by perfection. It does not mean any 
extraordinary service, anything out 
of the way or especially heroic, — not all 
have the opportunity of heroic acts 
or sufiferings, — ^but it means what the 
word "perfection" ordinarily means. By 
perfect we mean that which has no 
flaw in it, that which is complete, that 
which is consistent, that which is sound, 
— we mean the opposite to imperfect. 
He, then, is perfect who does the work 
of the day perfectly, and we need not go 
beyond this to seek for perfection. — Car- 
dinal Newman. 

IN order that the Cooking-School 
Magazine may reach its subscribers 
on the first day of each month, we 
are trying to make the date of publi- 
cation the 25th of the preceding month. 
That we may fully accomplish this, 
which we are sure will be most accept- 
able to our readers, contributed arti- 
cles to each department must be re- 
ceived at a date still earlier; that is, 
in the month preceding the date of 
publication. For instance, contribu- 
tions to our February number must be 
received in December, and those for 
March in January, and so on through 
the year. By this it will be seen that 
it takes one month, entire, to print, 
make, and mail a single issue of 
the magazine. Will our contributors 
kindly respond to this notice? 

WE wish to warn the readers 
of the Cooking-School Maga- 
zine against paying money 
to one W. K. Dana, who about one 
year ago unfortunately solicited sub- 
scriptions for this magazine in Lynn, 
Lowell, Lawrence, Fall River, Provi- 
dence, and other places in Eastern 
Massachusetts. This man is no longer 
our agent, nor is he authorized, in any 
wise, to represent the magazine, either 
directly or indirectly. 



ILLUSTRATED ARTICLES 

In the January number of the Cook- 
ing-School Magazine we shall print an 
illustrated article on Radcliffe College, 
Harvard's foster child, the woman's 
college whose scholarship is attested 
by the great university. This article 
is written by Mrs. Charles Norman, a 
graduate of Radcliffe. 

Our February number will contain 
another finely illustrated article on the 
famous Memorial Hall at Harvard, and 
its kitchens, where fifteen hundred 
students are fed daily. These papers 
are of interest to all women. The 
first points to the high position woman 
has attained; and the second shows 
how food is dispensed to large num- 
bers in a most satisfactory and hygienic 
manner. Are not women the chief dis- 
pensers of food ? 



NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH 

At the last meeting of the American 
Association for the Advancement of 
Science at Ithaca, June 30, 1906, a com- 
mittee was appointed, under resolutions 
of that body, to promote the establish- 
ment of a National Department of 
Health by agitation in aJl legitimate 
ways for the purpose of creating a pub- 
lic sentiment in its favor. The naming 
of the members of the committee is in 
the hands of Professor Irving Fisher, 
Yale Unive^ity, chairman of this sec- 
tion of th^ American Association for 
the Advancement of Science. The 
names of the Committee of One Hun- 
dred selected will be announced shortly. 
The movement in general already has 
the support of the principal journals 
of medicine and hygiene in the United 
States.

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 

IN all recipes where flour isused, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after sifting once. 
When flour is ineasured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. 
A tablespoonful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a level spoonful of such material. 

Creamed Smoked Halibut 
Select mild-cured halibut, moist 
rather than dry. Pick the fish into 
bits, cover these with cold water, and 
set upon the back of the range where the 
water will not boil, but gradually heat 
in half an hour to nearly the boiling- 
point. For a cup of fish melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Cook in it 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, and gradu- 
ally pour on one cup of rich railk. Stir 
until boiling, then add the fish and a 
slightly beaten egg. Stir and cook 
■without boiling until the egg thickens. 
Serve at once with baked or mealy, 
boiled potatoes. 

Hot Oyster Hors d'CEuvre 
Stamp out rounds of bread two 



inches in diameter and one-fourth 
an inch thick. Spread these with 
butter and brown them in the oven or 
in a frying-pan in a little hot butter. 
Spread with anchovy paste, and on the 
paste set a small piece of bacon, hot 
and broiled to a crisp. Over the bacon 
set a hot. broiled oyster, spread with 
maStre d'hfitel butter. Sprinkle the 
oysters with a very little fine-chopped 
parsley, and serve at once. 

Broiled Ham 
Select slices, cut one-fourth an inch 
in thickness, from the centre of a 
choice ham. Pour boiling water over 
the slices of ham, drain and wipe dry, 
then broil over a bed of not too 
fierce coals about five minutes. Spread

Galantine of Turkey 
Singe the turkey, pull the sinews from 
the legs, but leave undrawn. Cut 
through the skin on the back of the 
turkey down the whole length. Then, 
commencing at the shoulder blade, 
separate the flesh from the bones, first 
on one side and then on the other. The 
most of this work should be done with 
the back of a knife or the fingers. 
Leave the flesh of the legs and the vrings 



have white meat uniformly over the 
surface. Chop fine one pound and 
a half of veal or pork steak, season with 
salt and pepper, and add cream or 
broth to make the mixture quite 
moist. With this mixture fill in the 
spaces to make an even surface, then 
roll up the meat like a jelly roll, and 
sew through the skin to make a neat 
compact roll of meat. Mushrooms or 
truflles may be pressed into the force- 
meat here and there, and other sea-

strain over half a cup of currant jelly, 
and let simmer until the jelly is melted. 

Supreme of Cauliflower 
Separate a cauliflower of medium size 
into flowerets, shorten the stems, trimm- 
ing them to a point. Let the flowerets 
cook in salted boiling water about six 
minutes, then drain, cover with cold 
water, drain again, and let dry on a 
cloth. Line the bottom of a quart tim- 
bale mould with paper, then butter 
the mould thoroughly, and dispose the 
flowerets of cauliflower in the mould, 
one layer above another, to fill the mould 
loosely. Have ready 
one cup of raw chicken 
breast or veal steak, chop- 
ped very fine. Beat into it 
half a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of pap- 
rika, then one egg. When 
the mixture is smooth, beat 
in, one at a time, two or 
three more eggs (two will do 
if the eggs are large), then 
gradually beat in one cup, 
each, of cream and strong 
chicken broth or consomm^. 
Pour the mixture over the 
cauliflower in the mould. It should 
cover the cauliflower completely. Set 
the mould, on many folds of paper, in

Lady Baltimore Cake, No. i 

(Mrs. Jamea Dow) 

Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. 

Then gradually beat in one cup and a 



half of granulated sugar. Add, al- 
ternately, three-fourths a cup of water 
and two and one-fourth cups of flour 
(half a pound), sifted a second time 
with two level teaspoonfuls of baking- 
]K)wderand one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt. Beat the whites of four eggs dry. 
Beat part of the eggs into the cate 
mixture, also one cup of walnut meats, 
broken in pieces and floured, and, lastly, 
the rest of the egg whites. Bake in 'a 
moderate oven about fifty mintltes. 

Our Christtnas Cake 
The above recipe for Lady Baltimore 
cake was baked in a tube pan. For 
the icing boil half a cup of granulated 
sugar and one-third a cup of water 
four or five minutes. Add a table- 
spoonful of lemon juice and sifted con- 
fectioner's sugar to make a frosting 
that will spread upon the cake without 
dropping ofT. Spread the frosting on 
the sides of the cake with a silver knife, 
and press into this, as fast as spread, 
prepared or fresh cocoanut. When the 
sides of the cake are finished, drop a 
narrow line of frosting around the 
cake close to the edge, and cover it with 
cocoanut. Inside this edge dispose a 
conventionalized flower design. For 
this use cherries, pis{achio nuts, and 
angelica, or citron. Use the angelica

or citron for the stems, the cherries, 
cut in eighths lengthwise, for the 
blossoms, and the blanched nuts, cut in 
eighths, for petioles and calyx. In the 
illustration, rosebud candle holders 
(costing about thirty-five cents per 
dozen) are pressed into the cake to 
hold the candles. 

Lady Baltimore Cake, No. 2 

(May Shepherd) 

Cream one cup of butter. Grad- 
ually beat into it two cups of sugar. 
Sift together three and one-half cups 
of sifted flour and two level teaspoon- 
fuls of baking-powder, and add the 
flour to the butter and sugar, al- 
ternately, with one cup of milk and 
one teaspoonful of rose water. Beat 
the mixture very thoroughly, and, 
lastly, gently fold in the whites of 
six eggs, beaten light. Bake in three- 
layer cake-pans. 

Filling and Frosting for Lady Bal- 
timore Cake 
Dissolve three cups of granulated 
sugar in one cup of boiling water, and 
cook until the syrup will spin a thread 
about three inches in length, or to 
242** F. on the sugar thermometer. 
Then pour it in a fine stream onto the 
whites of three eggs, beaten until stiff, 
beating constantly meanwhile. To 
this frosting add one cup of chopped 
raisins, one cup of chopped nut-meats, 
— pecan nuts preferred,- — and five figs, 
cut into very thin strips. Cake shown 
in the frontispiece is made by this 
recipe. Half nut-meats, round red 
candies, size of holly berries, and bits 
of angelica are also used to give the 
cake a Christmas aspect. 

Choice Butter Caramels 

Put one pound of sugar, one pound of 
glucose, half a pound of butter, and 
one cup of cream (not milk) over the 
fire. Stir and cook until the mass 



boils throughout. Then stir in gradu- 
ally — so as not to stop the boiling — 
a second cup of cream. Put in the 
sugar thermometer, and let the mixture 
boil, stirring every three or four min- 
utes, mitil the thermometer registers 
250° F. Then stir in a teaspoonful of 
vanilla, and turn the candy into two 
brick-shaped bread-pans, nicely but- 
tered, or onto an oiled marble between 
steel bars, to make a sheet three- 
fotuths an inch thick. When nearly 
cold, cut in cubes. Roll these at once 
in waxed paper or let stand twenty- 
four hours to dry off. Without a ther- 
mometer boil the mass to a pretty firm 
hard ball. No better caramels can be 
made. The time of boiling varies, but 
often an hour is required. In summer 
the caramels will hold their shape 
better if boiled from two to four degrees 
higher. 

Cream Caramels 

Put one cup and a fourth of sugar 
and half a pound of glucose into a 
saucepan. Beat the yolk of an egg, 
then gradually beat into it one pint 
of cream. (Milk will not do very well. 
Some form of fat, as cream or butter, 
is essential to good results.) Add one 
cup of the cream mixture to the sugar 
and glucose. Set the saucepan over 
the fire, and stir and cook constantly 
until the mixture boils. Then con- 
tinue stirring while the rest of the 
cream and egg is gradually stirred into 
the boiling mixture. The cream must 
be added very slowly, that the syrup 
may be kept boiling constantly. Let 
the whole boil to 230® F. Then stir 
in one-fourth a cup of butter, creamed 
and mixed with half a cup of pastry 
flour. Let the mixtiu'e cook to 240° F. 
Then turn into an oiled bread-pan. 
When partly cold, cut in cubes. Nuts 
or candied fruit may be added at 
pleasure to any caramels as the mixture 
is taken from the fire.

One thoni of experience is worth & whole wilderness of wanung. — LnM. 



AS sheep proverbially follow 

/\ blindly their leader, so people 
/ ^ are often wont to take up any 
new thing presented to them without 
giving a thought to the reason for so 
doing. As caterers for our tables and 
as cooks, we are not independent 
enough. "We should have a reason 
for the hope that is in us." 

Take such matters as the drinking 
of water, the morning plunge in cold 
water, or the non-eating of meat. Why 
should each and all follow the lead of 
another? The quantity of water one 
should drink depends on the state of 
the weather, the quantity of liquid 
food ingested, the amount of exercise 
taken, the size of the individual, and 
the conditions of the heart and the 
digestive organs. How can one speci- 
fic quantity be prescribed for all? 
Three pints of water per day may be 
none too much for one individual, but 
this quantity will keep another in a 
state of chronic flatulency, morbidity, 
and ill-health. There are people who 
should never drink water unless thirsty. 

The shock to the system of a daily 
plunge in cold water has shortened the 
days of many who have blindly fol- 
lowed the lead of some one with more 
presumption than knowledge. 

Shall I give up the eating of meat, 
and bribe my family into doing the 
same, because some one urges it ? No 
woman can with impunity carry out 



such a procedure — though many at- 
tempt it — unless she be well grounded 
in the knowledge of the compoation 
of food and its function in tbe body. 
She must know food values. Aade 
from reasons of sentiment, meat is ob- 
jectionable on accoimt of the large 
quantity of uric acid which it intro- 
duces into the system; but dried peas, 
beans, and lentils are open to the same 
objection, and in an intensified degree. 
What, then, are you gaining by the 
change? There is no doubt but that 
many eat too much meat, and that it 
were wise to replace meat, to some ex- 
tent, with nuts, cheese, and foods rich 
in gluten, as the grains, but the matter 
must be made one of individual study. 
There should be no blind following of 
the blind. 

We read that the Japanese, after the 
most vigorous exercise, can^ — though 
dripping with perspiration — sit down 
in a direct draft of air to cool off. In 
this procedure they who follow the 
Japanese as leaders will not wait long 
to pay the penalty of their folly. The 
habits and daily mode of life for count- 
less generations has made this thing 
possible, perhaps, to the Japanese. 
With us it is, "Live to leam, and you 
will leam to live." 

We are inclinad to shun physical 
exercise, and, following the lead of the 
crowd, think even housework detracts 
from our health no less than from our 



After Bretkfkst Chat

dignity; but the woman who takes 
physical exercise sets the blood in cir- 
culation, delivers the nutritious ele- 
ments of the food ingested where they 
are needed, and drives waste matters 
out through the pores of the skin. 
Often dish-washing will prove a most 
efficacious remedy for the dull, drowsy 
sensations just after breakfast. Let 
active exercise start the perspiration, 
and cold extremities will become warm, 
the brain clear, and the day will not 
be lost. » 

Some one writes: **Why do you give 
baked potatoes in the breakfast menus ? 
It takes too long to cook them. " There 
are always small potatoes in the lot 
you buy: these will bake in twenty- 
five minutes. But whether you choose 
to bake them will depend entirely on 
conditions. You will not heat a gas 
oven to bake four or five small pota- 
toes; but, if you are to bake muffins, 
which takes just twenty-five minutes, 
and at the same time broil chops or 
bacon in the lower oven, why not bake 
the potatoes? 

Another subscriber, writing for a 
recipe for "pressed meat," says, "Per- 
mit me to remark how too frequently 
the fact is ignored by contributors to 
cooking magazines and housekeepers' 
columns in newspapers that an un- 
numbered army of housekeepers who 
live in apartment houses cook exclu- 
sively with gas, and, when directions 
for cooking four, six, or eight hours 
are given, the recipes are valueless 
because of the extravagance involved." 

Through lack of the rudimentary 
knowledge of a subject, the impossible 
is sometimes expected. One would 
not buy a spring chicken or beef from 
the loin for a dish of pressed meat. 
There are far more appetizing ways 
of presenting these choice articles. 
For pressed meats, cheap cuts of meat 
are selected, and these absolutely re- 
quire long, slow cooking. The sim- 
mering burner of a gas range, turned 



low, will give ample heat for this kind 
of cooking, and at no great expense, 
even if the process be prolonged six or 
eight hours. We venture to say that, 
properly used, the quantity of gas con- 
sumed will not much more than equal 
that required for baking in an hour 
and a half the same weight of tender 
meat. But all cooking with gas must 
be watched. The same is true when 
wood or coal is the fuel, for the pot 
must be kept at a gentle simmer con- 
stantly, not occasionally, if good re- 
sults are to be secured Is it not ex- 
travagance in the use of time quite as 
much as of fuel that is the matter ? 

As quite a number of our subscribers 
asked for a recipe for Lady Baltimore 
cake, we have printed two recipes, 
both of which are illustrated. We 
followed, in making the cakes, the 
recipes sent, measuring the baking- 
powder level and the flour after once 
sifting, filling the cup with a spoon. 
In sending us cake recipes, we like to 
have these points made plain to us. 
We print no recipes for cake that we 
have not ourselves tried and approved. 
Both cakes would cut to better advan- 
tage and in prettier-shaped pieces for 
serving, if they were bak^ in two layers 
to give more surface. A subscriber 
from St. Paul writes: "We think the 
recipe for *Nut Layer Cake, Nut Frost- 
ing,' given in the August-September 
number for 1904, corresponds exactly 
to Owen Wister's description of 'Lady 
Baltimore Cake.' This cake is one 
of our favorites, and, after reading the 
story, we immediately named it 'Lady 
Balthnore.' " 

Mint jelly is another recipe for which 
numerous requests have been received. 
Two bunches of mint to two pounds 
of apples will seem a large proportion 
of mint, but even this quantity will 
produce only a very deUcately flavored 
jelly. The flavor seems to be dissi- 
pated during the cooking. We are in- 
clined to think that quite as well- 
flavored jelly would be obtained by 



14S 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



the use of an essence of spearmint — ^if 
such there be — or] crfeme-de-menthe 
cordial. Either of these could be 
added to the hot jelly, in quantity to 
suit the taste, when the jelly is ready 
to turn into the glasses. In making 
up only two pounds of apples, boil 
the juice that drains from the jelly 
bag apart from that secured by pres- 
sure, as the former will give a much 
clearer and handsomer jelly than the 
latter. 

A steward wishes suggestions that 
will aid in feeding 30 fraternity boys 
at a Western university. The boys 
P&y $3*50 per week. It is desired that 
this money supply the table, pay S14 
per week for help and about $3 per 
week for fuel. Two waiters receive 
board for their work. A simple ex- 
ample in arithmetic gives 735 meals 
to be supplied for $87.50, or about 11 J 
cents per meal. Or, putting it another 
way, 35 J cents is allowed for the food of 
each person per day. This sum should 
suffice for a fair table, at which some of 
what might be termed "luxuries" are 
to be found. 

The dietary suitable for a wage- 
earner is usually estimated at 25 cents 
per day. loj cents added to this — 
nearly one-third more — should cer- 
tainly be enough to provide a bill of 
fare acceptable to students. Indeed, 
even in New England, where prices 



are much higher than in the West, 
acceptable board has been provided 
for girls at school for 25 cents per day; 
but this is close work. 

For 25 cent dietaries our corre- 
spondent is referred to Bulletins 29, 32, 
46, 52, 55, 91, Experiment Stations, 
United States Department of Agri- 
culture. With these as guide, it will 
be a comparatively simple matter to ar- 
range working bills of fare acceptable 
to students and that shall furnish 
the proper food elements in right pro- 
portion. In planning these (or any) 
bills of fare, while always keeping an 
eye to the cost of the raw materials, 
the following things must be looked 
out for, — nutrition, bulk and waste, 
agreeable flavor and variety. As we 
have often emphasized in these pages, 
**cut-and-dried" bills of fare should be 
discarded. Make much of the ele- 
ment of surprise. Adapt the food to 
the season, and also to the weather. 
A suet pudding, which may be whole- 
some in a crisp, cold, bracing air, would 
be quite out of place on a warm day, 
or when written examinations were in 
progress. Fruit, either dried or fresh, 
should be provided plentifully.

give a menu for a ladies* luncheon. This 
menu we shall carry out in detail, giving the 
recipes and illustrations of all the dishes pre- 
pared. — ^Ed.

A HANDY place for the cook-book 
is directly above the cooking table 
on a slanting shelf at the height of the 
eyes. There the book can remain open, 
and be kept clean and be easily read. 



Hi. If one finds herself confronted with 
deep drawers in which many things 
must be kept, and kept smooth, insert- 
ing trays as in a trunk, is a good idea. 

Housewives are rarely consulted by 
architects in regard to the use of 
drawers, and in these days, when so 
much is built into houses, one is sure 
to find herself filling a deep drawer, 
and emptying it upon her next visit to 
get the needed article, which is certain 
to be at the bottom. This, of course, 
musses everything more or less, and is 
not conducive to patience. Whereas 
in half an hour a thin board may be 
sawed the correct length and width, 
two narrow cleats tacked on to the 
sides of the drawer, and, when a cover- 
ing of white cloth is made, it is finished. 
The covering buttons on, then it can 
be easily removed, washed, and re- 
turned to its usefulness. 

If tape hangers are sewed at either 
end, the tray is easily removed when 
wishing to get at things beneath. The 
drawer in mind is twenty-one and a 
half inches long, fourteen inches wide, 
and ten inches deep, and the tray is 
twenty-one and a fourth inches long, 
and only eleven inches wide, so that 
the three inches left give ample room 
to reach underneath, and in this way 
the tiay can be moved back and forth, 
and does not need to be removed 



always. In this particular drawer the 
cleats are put four inches from the top. 
On the tray, table cloths are kept, and 
below napkins, and it answers as well 
as two separate drawers. 

M. E. Robinson. 



A MEDIUM-SIZED paint brush wiU 
be found most useful in cleaning a 
room. If a clean, dry brush is used all 
about the window-panes, around the 
mop -boards, in the crevices of the 
doors, and wherever there may be in- 
equalities to catch dust, on sweeping 
days, you will be surprised at the 
amount of dust dislodged, and at the 
pervading look of cleanliness, and you 
will find that soap and water will not 
have to be applied half as frequently. 



An ordinary blackboard eraser, such 
as is used in schools, will be found a 
most useful implement. The comers of 
a hard-wood floor are always a difScult 
place to reach with the weighted brush, 
but the eraser will reach all comers and 
give a good polish, or, if the poUsh 
has come off in any place, mb on a 
Uttle wax, and then polish with the 
eraser, and the floor will look as good 
as before. ^__.^__

articles to have in and about a kitchen. 
It can be used to wipe off molasses 
that may have trickled down the jug, 
to wipe up a little grease that has 
fallen upon the floor or the stove, to 
grease a pan or dish quickly, to remove 
a spot or speck from the window or 
mirror, to absorb some of the grease 
from a dirty pan, and thus prevent 
clogging up the sink. In fact, it can be 
used in countless ways, and, after being 
used, it can be at once burned, thus 
saving much washing of cloths. If a 
housekeeper will only try keeping a 
package in a handy place in the kitchen, 
she will be surpri^ how often it comes 
into play. 

A few cents expended for clean, new 
wrapping paper is a good investment, 
as the paper will save much time 
spent in cleaning up a table on which 
cooking has been done, and will keep 
the table looking fresh much longer, 
besides saving time in washing dish 
cloths. Then many vegetables can be 
prepared on the paper, and the refuse 
can be gathered up in the paper and 
thrown out or burned, and the paper 
itself can be burned, making a great 
saving in time and trouble.

Lettuce Bag 

BAGS 15 X 24 inches made from 
bobbinet or worn-out net curtains, 
are indispensable in our household. 



When lettuce, parsley, radishes, 
spinach, or other tender green stuff 
comes from the market, it is washed 
ready for use, then put it in a bag, which 
is thrown into the ice chamber or on the 
shelves of the refrigerator. This method 
of keeping such articles insures a clean 
ice-box. 

To be certain that lettuce is entirely 
free from the small bugs so often found 
on it, hold each leaf, after washing, 



between you and the light, this is a 
most effectual way to locate any de- 
posit of any kind on the leaf. 

Winter Jelly Making 

Prepare fruit juices ready for jelly, 
minus the sugar. Seal while boiling hot 
in jars or bottles. When cold weather 
comes, open a jar of each kind, and 
make up just as you would in the sum- 
mer season. This gives nice fresh 
jelly, which is always better than that 
which has been xnade several months. 



Swiss Steak 



Three pounds round steak, cut one 
and one-half inches thick. Pound until 
fibre is thoroughly broken up, then knead 
into it, with the knuckles, two large 
tablespoonfuls flour. Season with salt 
and pepper. Into the skillet put large 
tablespoonful of butter and brown the 
steak on both sides, then pour boiling 
water over it, letting it just simmer for 
three hours. A bay leaf may be added 
if liked. 

This is an excellent way to prepare 
a cheaper cut of beef, and, when done, 
it is very good. 

WHEN strained honey gets candied, 
place the jar containing it in 
some warm water on the back of the 
stove, and leave until clear again. 
No injury is done to the honey. 



Save the tops of discarded stockings. 
Cut off the feet and sew across, making 
a sort of mitten. They are invaluable 
for lifting ice or pans of hot ashes. 
Two sewed one inside the other makes 
a thicker pair. d. m. l.

WHEN hanging the newly starched 
muslin curtains, put a thimble 
on the end of the curtain rod, and it

will run in easily without tearing the 
curtain. 

A new and successful way of alter- 
ing the color of an old or faded silk 
or piece of ribbon is called the dry 
method. Put sufficient gasolene to 
cover well the goods in a bowl or other 
vessel large enough to hold it, then add 
ordinary oil paint, such as comes in the 
little tubes for artists, until the proper 
color is attained. Test the shade with 
a bit of the material to be colored, and, 
when the right amount of paint has 
been added, plunge in the goods, rins- 
ing them rapidly up and down so as 
to insure an even color. Wring, and 
press while damp. By this means it is 
often possible to secure trimmings for 
peculiar shades of cloth that are hard 
to match. Old trimmings and pas- 
sementeries can easily be made as good 
as new, and of exactly the tone de- 
sired. 

To clean badly discolored vases, 
wash with tea leaves and vinegar. 
The combination is better than either 
alone. 

A good way to finish a pine floor that 
is to be stained around the edges is to 
apply an oil stain first, then a varnish 
stain, and lastly a coat of clear or 
natural-colored floor finish. The clear 
floor finish adds to the wearing quali- 
ties of the floor without darkening it, 
as several coats of colored varnish will. 
The oil stain prevents white marks.

How to Eat 

Horace Fletcher's Rules for the Perfect 
Feeding of the Human Body 

Here are Horace Fletcher's rules for 
eating, which are given to all the 
patients of the Harvard Dental School 
Dispensary: — 



1. Eat only in response to an actual 
appetite, which will be satisfied with 
plain bread and butter. 

2. Chew all solid food until it is 
Uquid and practically swallows itself. 

3. Sip and taste all Uquids that have 
taste, such as soup and lemonade. 
Water has no taste, and can be swal- 
lowed immediately. 

4. Never take food while angry or 
worried, and only when calm. Waiting 
for the mood in connection with the 
appetite is a speedy ctu-e for both anger 
and worry. 

5. Remember and practise these four 
rules, and yotu* teeth and health will be 
fine. 

Equally significant of the growth of 
Fletcherism are the efforts made by the 
proprietor of a chain of fifty dairy 
restaurants in New York and elsewhere. 
It consists of the distribution of a nicely 
printed folder among the customers, 
containing a ** dietetic code." It in- 
cludes instructions on **How to Eat." 
Some of them are: **Eat slowly and 
masticate thoroughly " ; * * Never permit 
yoiurself to eat a meal in a condition of 
nervous worry"; **Eat what you find 
of benefit " ; * * Do not eat anything that 
disagrees with you." Commenting on 
the last rule, the folder says : — 

The following out of this rule will 
require self-denial, but some time in 
your life you must definitely decide 
whether you are to be master over 
yoiu- body or be its slave, and it is 
better to make the decision at once, 
and after you have practised correct 
habits of eating for a short time it 
will be surprising how soon your true 
appetite for things that are wholesome 
and good will assert itself, and you 
will instinctively turn to the right 
foods. 

Here, then, is a "quick-lunch" res- 
taurant advising its patrons to use 
slow-lunch methods. — From the World's

QuBRY 1 1 82. — H. L. H., Minneapolis, Minn.: 
"Kindly tell how to cook a chicken (separated 
at the joints) in a casserole. We have had 
three casseroles broken the first or second 
time they were used." 

Casserole G>okery 

Probably casseroles of French or 
German ware, which are * 'fine-grained " 
and thoroughly * 'burned," are the 
most durable, and those of Japanese 
ware, which are rather coarse, are 
the least durable, of all the dishes 
found in the shops for this use. Still, 
the coarse, cheap Japanese casseroles 
will stand much service, if they be 
properly treated. A fine, highly 
glazed and finished French dish will 
stand being filled with a cold liquid 
when the dish is hot, or it may be 
used for sautfibig the article that is 
to be cooked in it; but neither of 
these things should be attempted with 
Japanese ware. If the liquid in a 
casserole needs replenishing, add hot 
water from the teakettle; that is, 
if the heating of a little stock -in a 
saucepan seems too much of an effort. 
The evaporation of all, or a large por- 
tion, of the liquid from the casserole 
would seem to indicate rapid cooking, — 
a condition most undesirable, when 
the best results are looked for. 

Recipe for Casserole Cooking 

Cook the article, separated into 
joints, in butter, bacon, or salt-pork 
fat, made hot in a frying-pan, until 



browned on one side. Then turn the 
pieces, and brown the other side. 
Put the joints into the casserole: put 
in about a pint of hot stock or water, 
cover the dish, and set into the oven. 
If it be young chicken, partridge, 
squirrel, whole squab, or quail, 4et cook 
at a gentle simmer about an hour 
and a quarter. Then add two dozen 
potato balls or cubes, one dozen tiny 
young onions or peeled fresh mush- 
room caps, and a dozen slices of car- 
rot, all browned in the frying-pan, 
and three or four tablespoonfuls of 
sherry wine, with salt and pepper to 
season. Cover closely, and let cook 
fifteen or twenty minutes longer. Send 
to the table in the dish, and without 
removing the cover. Flour and water 
mixed to a thin dough may be rolled 
into a rope or string, under the hands, 
and pressed upon the casserole, where 
the dish and cover meet, to keep in 
flavor.

QuBRY 1 1 84.— Mrs. D. A. G., Jamcsville, 
N.Y.: "Recipes for preserve called golden 
chips, apple ginger, and mint jelly that will 
keep indefinitely." 

Golden Chips (Orange) 

Cut the oranges in quarters, and 
carefully press the quarters on a 
sieve or grater, to remove all the* juice 
and edible pulp. Put the peel to 
soak in salted water (a tablespoonful 
to a quart) over night. The next 
day drain and boil in fresh water 
until tender. Again drain the peel, 
then cut into slices, and add to the 
juice. Take sugar equal in weight 
to that of the juice and peel. Stir 
until the sugar is dissolved, then cook 
slowly, stirring occasionally, until the 
sjrrup candies on the peel. Then 
set the peel aside in a cool place to 
dry. 

Golden Chips (Pumpkin) 

Cut a small, sweet pumpkin in halves, 
and the halves into narrow strips. Re- 
move peel and seeds, then cut the strips 
into thin slices, notTmore than half 
an inch thick. Weigh the prepared 
pumpkin, and take an equal weight of 
sugar, also half a cup of lemon juice, 
to each two pounds of sugar. Put 
the pumpkin and sugar into a pre- 
serving kettle in alternate layers. 
Pour the lemon jtuce over the whole, 
cover, and let stand twenty-four hours. 
Have ready the lemon peel, neatly 
shredded, and an ounce of ginger 
root for each pound of fruit. Add 
these to the kettle with a cup of water 
for each three pounds of sugar. Cook 
until the pumpkin is tender, then pour 
into an earthen jar. In a few days 
pour the syrup from the pumpkin. 
Boil to reduce and thicken it, and 
pour, hot, over the pumpkin. 



Gingered Apples 

For five pounds of prepared apple 
allow five pounds of granulated sugar, 
five oimces of ginger root, three lem- 
ons, and a pint of water. Bruise the 
ginger root, and put it over the fire 
with the water. Let it simmer some 
hours, adding water, when needed, to 
get a strong decoction of ginger. Wipe 
the lemons carefully, then grate off 
the thin yellow rind, and extract the 
juice. Add these to the pint of ginger 
water. Remove the pieces of ginger 
from the water, or tie them in a mus- 
lin cloth, and let them remain till the 
confection is finished. Add the sugar 
and the apple. Select tart apples, 
pare and core, then chop them rather 
coarse. Boil the whole until the bits 
of apple look clear. Then store in 
jars. 

Mint Jelly (Mint-Apple) 

Greenings are a good variety of 
apple for this purpose. Wipe the 
apples, and remove defective places, 
but do not core them. Cut in halves 
or quarters. Put over the fire with 
water barely to the top of the apple. 
Let cook until the fruit is tender 
throughout. About twenty minutes 
before the cooking is completed, have 
ready, for two pounds of apple, the 
leaves from two btmches of mint, 
washed, dried, and chopped fine. Stir 
these into the apple. Finish cooking 
at a gentle simmer, then drain through 
a jelly bag. Allow three-fourths a 
cup of sugar to each cup of juice. 
Put the juice over the fire to boil 
and the sugar in the oven to heat. 
When the jtuce has boiled ten min- 
utes, add the juice of one lemon and 
green color (liquid) to get the required 
shade, also the sugar. Let the whole 
boil till a little jellies on a cold plate 
(probably less than five minutes), then 
strain into hot glasses. For a stronger 
flavor of mint, use more of the green 
mint. Two pounds of apples should

another pint by pressure.

Cress is probably the most suitable 
garnish for a platter holding a roast 
of beef or veal. Unless the platter 
be tmusually large, the whole space 
is needed for the disposal of the slices 
of meat.

Breakfast and Supper Dishes at 

Schools 
Once in a while, this winter, try 
ham broiled after the recipe given in 
this number of the magazine. I did 
not see boiled ham in the list of dishes 
submitted. Carefully cooked and 
sliced, this is most appetizing, served 
at either meal, with creamed potatoes, 
potatoes hashed in milk, or baked 
potatoes. At supper it may be served 
with lettuce, string bean, or potato 
salad. The chopped remnants of ham 
c ^T i be presented in sandwiches, with 
scrambled eggs, or as one of the in- 
gredients in veal loaf, which is another 
acceptable dish for breakfast, supper, 
or evening, provided it be prepared 
with care 



Cooked cheese dishes are always rel- 
ished ; and, if the evening be set aside 
for a social time rather than study, 
such dishes may be eaten in moderation 
at supper by all but the most delicate. 
Among the best cheese dishes are the 
Italian cheese dish ' *gnocchi ^ la Re- 
main," tomato rabbit, cheese pudding 
(bread, cheese, eggs, and milk, baked 
delicately), and hot rice or macaroni 
with tomato and cheese. Cream cheese 
with stewed prunes or hot baked sweet 
apples and cream may be eaten for 
* supper even by young children. 

Fresh fish should supply variety at 
schools located not too remote from 
the sea. Nothing can be more deli- 
cate than broiled halibut with maitre 
d' h6tel sauce ; and the cheaper haddock 
and cod are by no means to be depised. 
At a restaurant, managed by a woman, 
for bojrs from the School of Technology 
(Boston), creamed haddock au gratin 
in individual dishes is always a 
stand-by that receives merited attention. 
WafBes, when once the irons are in- 
stalled, will prove a luxury always 
hailed with delight.

cooled to a lukewarm temperature, 
and stir in about three-fourths a cup 
of flour, enough to make a dough 
that may be kneaded. Knead until 
the little ball of dough is smooth and 
elastic. Then make a cut across the 
top in two directions. Have ready 
a pint of boiled water, cooled to a luke- 
warm temperature, and into this put 
the ball of dough. It will sink to the 
bottom of the dish. In about fifteen 
minutes it will float upoxi the water, a 
light puffy ''sponge." Into this water 
and sponge stir a teaspoonful of salt 
and between five and six cups of flour, 
enough to make a dough stiff enough 
to knead. Knead or potmd the dough 
until it is smooth and elastic, and does 
not stick to the hands or board. It 
will take fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Part of the time the dough may be 
lifted up high and dropped onto the 
board with force. When properly 
kneaded, cover the dough, and set it 
aside in a temperature of about 70^ 
F. until it has doubled in bulk. There 
will be about two and three-fourths 
potmds of dough. This may be baked 
in any kind of a pan ; but, to secure the 
crusty French loaf, a Russia iron pan, 
giving long, narrow loaves, is desira- 
ble. For one of these pans divide the 
dough into two equal pieces. Roll, 
and stretch these under the hands, on 
the board, until they are as long as the 
pan. Have a round stick (like a cur- 
tain roller) lightly flotu^d. Press this 
down through the centre, lengthwise 
of the loaf, and roll it back and forth, 
to make a furrow. French bread is 
concave rather than convex on the top, 
but this shaping may be omitted. 
Cover, and let stand to become light. 
Cut three or foiu* slantwise cuts in the 
top of the bread, five or six inches apart. 
Bake about forty minutes. When 
nearly baked, brush over the surface 
with the white of an egg beaten with 
a tablespoonful of cold water, and re- 
turn to the oven. Repeat the glazing, 
if desired.

Keeping Anchovy Paste 

We cannot say just how long a jar 
of anchovy paste can be kept after it 
is opened. Anchovies put up in oil or 
salt may be kept months in a cool 
place without deterioration after the 
opening of the bottle, the oil and brine, 
respectively, keeping the air from con- 
tact with the fish; but anchovy paste 
and essence lose in palatability, and 
should be used as soon as expedient. 

Poached Eggs with Anchovy Toast 

Have ready a slice of toast and a 
carefully poached egg for each person 
to be served. Dip the edges of the 
toast in boiling salted water, and set 
on a hot plate. Spread the toast 
lightly with butter, and then with an- 
chovy paste. Then set an egg in the 
centre of each slice of toast. 

Anchovy Toast with Savory 

Custard 

Spread toast as before with butter 
and anchovy paste. Then set these 
into the oven to keep hot while the 
custard is prepared. Take one or more 
yolks (no whites) of eggs for each sUce 
of toast and a level tablespoonful of 
butter for each yolk. Melt one table- 
spoonful of butter in a saucepan (the 
fire should be very moderate, or a 
double boiler will be necessary) . Break 
in a yolk, and mix a little. Add an- 
other tablespoonful of butter, another 
yolk, and so on, until all are added. 
Shake in a little pepper and salt, and 



continue to stir until the whdle be- 
comes a very thick, creamy custard. 
Pour this over the prepared toast, and 
serve at once. 

Scotch Woodcock 

Have at hand two freshly boiled 
chicken, turkey, or duck Hvers. Pound 
and rub these to a smooth paste with 
two teaspoonfuls of anchovy paste, the 
yolk of a raw egg, and two level table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Add pepper to 
season, and press the whole through a 
sieve. Prepare four squares of toast. 
Spread the mixture over these, and set 
them into the oven. Beat the yolks of 
two eggs and one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of salt, and stir into a cup of cream 
made hot in a double boiler. Continue 
stirring until the mixture thickens, 
then pour it over the toast and serve 
at once. 

Scotch Woodcock No. 2 

Prepare the liver and anchovy mixt- 
ure as above, but use three raw yolks 
of eggs. Cook this in a cup of hot 
cream, and pour it over the fresh-made 
toast. 

Anchovy Toast with Spinach 

Have ready slices of toast. Wet the 
edges in boiling salted water or leave 
them crisp. Spread with butter, then 
with anchovy paste, and finish with 
spinach, chopped fine and made hot in 
a tablespooniul or two of cream sauce. 
Poached or scrambled eggs may be set 
above the spinach, when desired.

ring until the. mixture becomes smooth 
and thick. Then serve at once on slices 
of toast or crackers. 

Canning Beets 

Only tender young beets, about an 
inch and a half in diameter, can be 
canned successfully at home. Cook 
these as for the table, drain, cover with 
cold water, and with the hands push 
ofiF the skins. Put them into hot fruit 
jars, and fill the jars with boiling salted 
water, a teaspoonful to a quart. Put 
on the rubbers and covers, and set to 
steam for one hour. Then tighten the 
covers, and let cook fifteen minutes, and 
set aside when cold. 

Simple Puddings, etc. 

Outside of puddings on the order of 
the carrot pudding given among the 
seasonable recipes in this issue, we know 
of no puddings that can be made ready 
in the morning and cooked in the after- 
noon, unless it be such simple puddings 
that they might just as well be made 
at the time of cooking, as 

Poor Man's Rice Pudding 

Wash half a cup of rice, and turn it 
into a baking-dish. Add one cup of 
raisins, three-fourths a cup of sugar, 
a teaspoonful of salt, a grating of nut- 
meg, and a quart of milk. Let cook 
in a very slow oven about two hours, 
stirring in the crust that forms on the 
top and dislodging the rice and raisins 
that settle to the bottom of the dish 
three or four times meanwhile. Add 
more milk or a little cream, if the pud- 
ding looks at all dry when cooked. 
Wait until reheated, then, serve. This 
is also good cold. The cooking must 
be very slow, or the rice will be dis- 
colored. Use all the milk the rice will 
take up and thicken. The pudding 
should be so moist that a sauce will not 
be needed. 

A Simple Steamed Pudding 
Sift together one cup of entire-wheat 



flour, half a cup of white flour, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of 
soda, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
mace, and cloves, mixed together. Beat 
one egg. Add half a cup, each, of 
molasses and milk, and stir into the dry 
ingredients. Stir in fotur tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter and three-fourths a 
cup of fruit (currants, sultana raisins, 
citron, candied peel, chopped figs, dates, 
or prunes), either a variety or a combi- 
nation of two or more. Steam two 
and one-half hours. Serve with hard 
sauce^ The dry ingredients might be 
sifted into a mixing-bowl and the fruit 
gotten ready beforehand ; but the liquid 
should not be added until time of cook- 



ing. 



Plain White Cake 



Beat half a cup of butter to a cream; 
gradually beat in one cup of sugar, 
then half a cup of milk and two cups 
of sifted flour, sifted again with three 
level teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 
Lastly, beat in the whites of three eggs, 
beaten dry, and one teaspoonful of 
vanilla extract. This may be baked 
in a loaf, in layers, or in small tins. In 
small tins broken nut-meats or currants 
may be added. 

Uses for Grape Jelly that does not 

jelly 

Dilute the jelly with water. Stir 
until dissolved. Add lemon juice, and 
use for grape sherbet. Use with gela- 
tine for a dessert jelly, with gelatine 
and whipped whites of eggs for grape 
sponge, with gelatine and whipped 
cream for grape bavariose. Thicken 
it with cornstarch. Add a little lemon 
or orange juice, and use for a pudding 
sauce. Thicken with half a cup of 
cornstarch to a quart of liquid. Add 
the whipped whites of three eggs, and 
turn into a mould. Serve the dish 
with a custard made of the yolks of 
the eggs.

When we wish to consider the nu-

note, first, the percentage of protein, 
and, secondly, the percentage of car- 
bohydrate that it contains. Then we 
consider the availability of these com- 
pounds or the ease with which the 
system can assimilate them. A super- 
ficial comparison of the composition 
of macaroni and sirloin steak certainly 
speaks well for macaroni. Hoy, speak- 
ing of gluten food, says: "Gluten food 
is available in four forms, macaroni, * 
vermicelli, spaghetti paste, and alpha- 
bet noodles. The macaroni and spa- 
ghetti paste are well adapted, combined 
with tomato or cheese, for baked dishes. 
These are especially good for adults, 
while vermicelli and alphabet noodles, 
boiled plain and served with cream, are 
admirable dishes for children or those 
having feeble digestion." Vermicelli 
and alphabet noodles are very delicate 
forms of pasta, and soften very 
quickly in cooking. When cream is 
not available or for a change, they are 
very acceptable with the platter gravy 
{au jus) from roast beef or mutton. 
For any but very young children we 
see no reason why macaroni and spa- 
ghetti, cooked long enough, cotild not 
be served with cream or gravy in place 
of the more delicate gluten productions. 
None of these gluten foods are made as 
much use of in our dietaries as their 
food value warrants.

work, if you have too much of it to do. 

No one' knows this better than the 
hard-working, conscientious family 
doctor. He has troubles of his own, — 
often gets caught in the rain or snow, 
or loses so much sleep he sometimes 
gets out of sorts. An overworked Ohio 
doctor tells his experience: — 

' 'About three years ago, as the result 
of doing two men's work, attending a 
large practice and looking after the 
details of another business, my health 
broke down completely, and I was 
little better than a physical wreck. 

*'I su£fered from in^gestion and con- 
stipation, loss of weight and appetite, 
bloating and pain after meals, loss of 
memory and lack of nerve force for 
continued mental application. 

''I became irritable, easily angered, 
and despondent without cause. The 
heart's action became irregular and 
weak, with frequent attacks of palpita- 
tion during the first hour or two after 
retiring. 

"Some Grape-nuts and cut bananas 
came for my lunch one day, and pleased 
me particularly with the result. I 
got more satisfaction from it than 
from an3rthing I had eaten for months, 
and on further investigation and use 
adopted Grape-nuts for my morning 
and evening meals, served usually with 
cream and a sprinkle of salt or sugar. 

**My improvement was rapid and 
permanent in weight as well as in 
physical and mental endurance. In 
a word, I am filled with the joy of 
living again, and continue the daily use 
of Grape-nuts for breakfast and often 
for the evening meal.

Rocks 

Beat the whites of eight eggs until 
dry. Add a scant half-teaspoonful of 
cream of tartar, and very gradually 
beat in one pound of fine granulated 
sugar, then gently fold in one pound 
of blanched almonds, shredded very 
fine. Have ready boards an inch thick, 
covered with waxed paper, as formerly 
shown in these pages for meringues. 
Place the preparation on the paper in 
balls about an inch in diameter, and 
bake in a very slack oven. Then color 
a delicate straw shade. They should 
remain in the oven at least three-fotirths 
of an hour before they take on any 
color. 

Currant Loaf 

Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. 
Gradually beat in one cup of sugar, 
then one cup of currants, and the beaten 
yolks of three eggs. Add alternately 
half a cup of milk and one cup and 
three-fourths of sifted flour, sifted again 
with four level teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, and lastly the whites of three 
eggs, beaten light. Turn into a shallow 
pan, dredge the top with granulated 
sugar, and bake about forty minutes. 

Light-colored Spice Cake 

Cream half a cup of butter and beat 
the yolks of four eggs very light, then 
gradually beat one cup of sugar into 
each, and finally beat the two together. 
Pass through a sieve, together, three 
cups of flour, half a teaspoonful of soda, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of mace 
and nutmeg, half a teaspoonful of cin- 
namon, one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt, and one teaspoonful and three- 
fourths of cream of tartar. Add these 



No CofFee 

The Doctor said 

Coffee slavery is not much different 



from alcohol or any other drug. But 
many people don't realize that coffee 
contains a poisonous, habit-forming 
drug,— caffeine. 

They get into the habit of using 
coffee, and no wonder, when some 
vmters for respectable magazines and 
papers speak of coffee as ''harmless." 

Of course, it doesn't paralyze one in 
a short time like alcohol, or put one to 
sleep like morphine, but it slowly acts 
on the heart, kidneys, and nerves, and 
soon forms a drug-habit, just the same, 
and one that is the cause of many over- 
looked ailments. 

"I wish to state for the benefit of 
other coffee slaves," writes a Vermont 
young lady, ' 'what Postum Food Coffee 
has done for me. 

**Up to a year ago I thought I could 
not eat my breakfast if I did not have 
at least two cups of coffee, and some- 
times during the day, if very tired, 
I would have another cup. 

**I was annoyed with indigestion, 
heart trouble, bad feeling in my head, 
and sleeplessness. Our family doctor, 
whom I consulted, asked me if I drank 
coffee. I said I did, and could not get 
along without it. 

* 'He told me it was the direct cause of 
my ailments, and advised me to drink 
Postum. I had no faith in it, but 
finally tried it. The first cup was not 
boiled long enough and was distasteful, 
and I vowed I would not drink any 
more. 

"But, after a neighbor told me to

Of Special Interest 
to Women who ^o 

to Market 



You might not expect to learo any- 
thing new or interesting about such a 
commonplace article of food as sau- 
sage, but wait a moment We are 
going to show you that there is some- 
thing both new and interesting to be 
said on this old subject 

You have heard the expression 
"linked sweetness,** which, of course, 
hardly applies to sausage, but, if we 
may be allowed to coin a somewhat 
similar phrase, "linked deliciousness** 
seems exacdy to describe 



Another point' is that you know 
who made the sausage, each package 
being stamped with our name. This 
fact is wordi knowing when you cour 
sider that we insist on perfect cleanli- 
ness in every part of our immense 
plant 

And of decided interest is the 
fact that only choice portions of 
young fresh pork are used for Squire's 
"Arlington" Sausage, this meat 
being chopped (not ground) and 



Squire's ** Arlington " Sausci^e 



Now, the new feature about these 
sausage is that they are put up in one- 
pound packages, each pound being 
double-wrapped in heavy parchment 
paper and sealed. This work is done 
rig^tin our factory, where the sausage 
are made. 

This fact of itself is interesting, 
but still more so are some of the re- 
sults of the package plan. For ex- 
ample, you are sure that the sausage 
you buy have not been exposed to 
the dust and germ-laden air of the 
market or to promiscuous handling. 
The package wrapped in our factory 
is viuopen^ untu it reaches your 
kitchen. 



seasoned with pure s|Mces which we 
ourselves grind. 

If you have never eaten Squire's 
''Arlington" Sausage, you have a 
treat m store. Your regular dealdr can 
supply you if he will. If he seems to 
prefer to seD you something else, send 
us one dollar, and we will send you 
five one-pound packages of Squire's 
"Arbrtgton " Sausage and a sample 
pail of Squire*s Ketde-rendered Pure 
Leaf Lard, the finest lard in the 
worid. Express paid within 300 
miles of BostoiL If you can't use 
five pounds, share them with some 
neiglibor. 



N.B. — You penonally are innted to riot our factory. It it in East Cambridge, only 
tea minutet' ride by electrics from the North Station m Boston. Guides are always waiting 
to show visitors through the plant, and it is well described as ** One of the Sights of Boston.

to the butter mixture alternately with 
one cup of milk, and finally beat in the 
whites of four eggs, beaten dry. Bake 
in two brick loaf pans about fifty 
minutes. 

Query 1193. — Mrs. L. B. E., Oakland, Cal.: 
"Recipe for Neapolitan cake — three layers, 
white, pink, and chocolate — ^with a cream 
filling and chocolate frosting, rich orange 
layer cake with cream filling flavored with 
orange, and baby dttam candy." 

Neapolitan Cake 

Cream one cup of butter. Beat in 
gradually two cups of sugar, then al- 
ternately half a cup of milk and three 
and one-half cups of flour, sifted again 
with four level teaspoonf uls of baking- 
powder. Lastly, beat in the whites of 
seven eggs. Take out one-third of the 
mixture and flavor it with half a the 
spoonful of lemon extract. Flavor one- 
half of the rest with half a teaspoonful 
of rose extract and tint it rose-color. 
To the last third of the mixture beat in 
half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of ground 
cinnamon, and one otmce and a half 
of melted chocolate. Boil three table- 
spoonfuls, each, of sugar and water 
two or three minutes. Add half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and sifted confec- 
tioner's sugar to make a thin paste. 
Spread this over each layer to hold 
them together, having the chocolate 
layer on the bottom and the pink one 
next to it. Make the usual boiled 
frosting with three-fourths a cup of 
sugar, one-fourth a cup of water, one 
ounce of chocolate, and the white of 
one eggf and spread over the top layer. 

Rich Orange Layer Cake 

butter cake is not as appropriate as 
a cake made rich with yolks of eggs. 
Thus we give the latter. Flavor the 
cream with grated rind of orange and 
sweeten before whipping. 

Take six eggs, the weight of the eggs 
in sugar, half their weight in flour, 
the grated rind of a lemon and two 
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Beat 



the yolks until light in color and thick. 
Add the sugar gradually, then the 
grated rind and juice of the lemon. 
Have ready the whites of the eggs, 
beaten dry. Cut and foU half of 
them into the cake mixture, then cut 
and fold in half of the flour, the other 
half of the whites, and the rest of the 
flour. Bake the mixture in two shal- 
low pans. 

Baby Cream Candy 

Put five pounds of sugar, — cof- 
fee A is preferable to granulated 
sugar, — one pint of water, and one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
over the fire. Stir until the sugar is 
melted, then wash down the sides of 
the pan with the hand wet in cold 
water, cover, and let boil vigorously 
five minutes. Remove the cover, and 
boil without stirring to 275® F. (nearly 
to the "soft crack" stage). Pour the 
candy onto a cold, oiled platter or 
marble, leave until it cools a little, then 
add two vanilla seeds (taken from 
vanilla beans). A tablespoonful of 
vanilla extract will do, though much of 
the flavor is wasted. Fold the candy 
together until it cools a little, then 
pull over a hook until almost cold, 
then pull out in bars two inches wide, 
and mark in strips the length desired. 
When cold, break apart, and let stand 
in a cool, dry place for three or four 
hours. Pack in glass or tin. When 
creamy and soft, the candy is ready for 
use.

Book Reviews 



Tbb Hbaltbpul Farmhouse. By 
Helen Dodd. Cloth. Price 60 cts. 
net. Boston : 'W'hitcomb & Bar- 
rows. 

This book is by a farmer's wife for 
the average farmer's wife, and from 
the point of view of one who does ber 
own cootdng, dish-washing, sweeping, 
and laundry work, yet runs a lawn- 
mower and cares for the flower-beds 
about the house, and does much work 
in the vegetable garden. It may be 
said that the writer has lived in cities 
and studied and worked at other call- 
ings, and has come back te live sin- 
cerely on a farm. She insists that 
the farm is the best place to make 
this happy, healthful life full of 
beauty and truth, in spite of the hard 
work and many responsibilities; and 
her view is correct. 

The aim of the book, then, is to 
point out the dangers of the old houses, 
and show the most necessary elements 
in right living, and to help those 
starting on a new plan for housewoik 
by the experiences of one who has 
tried it. 

The contents of this little book, 
read and put into practice, would 
transform the average country farm- 
house into a healthy happy, and beau- 
tiful home. Ellen H. Richards writes 
the introduction and last chapter 



of the book. All the signs of the 
times point to improved ways of living 
in the country and on the farm. 

PROGKBSS IN THE H0t«BHOLD. By 

Lucy Maynard Salmon. Cloth. 

Price li.io, net. Boston & New 

York: Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Ten years ago the author of this 
book wrote "Domestic Service." Here 
are ten sketdies on the same subject. 
These are entitled: "Recent Progress 
in the Study of Domestic Service," 
"Education in the Household," "Tbe 
Relation of College Women to Do- 
mestic Science," "Sairey Gamp" and 
"Dora Copperfield," "Economics of 
Ethics in Domestic Service," "Put 
Yourself in her Place," "Our Kitchen," 
"An Illustrated Edition," and "The 
Woman's Exchange." All the topics 
are treated in a literary, scientific, and 
scholarly manner. The author be- 
lieves that domestic science, like other 
kinds of business, must be placed upon 
a scientific bo^s. She 8a]rs, "House- 
keeping affairs have been passive re- 
cipients of general progress, not active 
participants in it. 

"If, then, domestic science is to be 
made a subject of serious study, and 
is to be accorded a permanent place 
in the school curriculum, if the house- 
hold is to profit by the educational

Pleasing Booklets 
No more interesting and attractive 
booklets are in circulation than those 
issued by the Proctor & Gamble Co. 
of Cincinnati, Ohio. And, what is 
more, the manuals ate of practical 
usefulness in every household. "How 
to bring up a Baby : A Handbook for 
Mothers," is by Elizabeth Robinson 
Scovil, graduate of the Massachusetts 
General Hospital Training School for 
Nurses. It tells what one ought to 
do to keep the baby in good healtli, 
how to treat the minor ailments of 
childhood, and when to send for a 
phyacian. We do not know where so 
much really helpful and useful infor- 
mation can be fotmd in equal space. 
All the facts, hints, and directions are 
so arranged and presented that they 
can be consulted with the least effort. 
Likewise the handsome booklet on 
"Approved Methods for Home Laun- 
dering" is, perhaps, the most complete 
as well as the most reliable publication 
ever issued that deals with the problems 
of home laundering. It contains just 
the information one needs, no more 
and no less, on every phase of this 
subject. These booklets are very 
handy, and cannot fail to be very help- 
ful to wise and efficient action in the 
household. 



The latest chapter of Mark Twun's 
autobiography is chiefly devoted to a 
reminiscence of how he made use of 
certain language when he fotmd the 
buttons o£F his shirts, and how his wife 
repeated the language verbatim to let 
her husband hear how it sounded. It 
seems to have had the dedred effect for 
the time being, and it may therefore 
be recommended for the treatment of 
paternal profanity in the family drcle.

No More Bleached Sugar 
Unless the United States Pure Food 
Commission changes its mind, the peo- 
ple of tbe United States will soon be 
using granulated and other sugars that 
have a distinctly yellowish tinge. The 
Commission has decreed that no min- 
eral bluing substance be used in bleach- 
ing sugar, and the refiners and their 
chemists are much disturbed. Sugar 
chemists say that they use fotir pounds 
of a mineral bluing substance to every 
one miUion pounds of sugar, for bleach- 
ing purposes. 

This, the sugar chemists say, is not 
adulteration; that it is merely purifi- 
cation by a thoroughly healthful proc- 
ess. Xhe Pure Pood Commission can- 
not see it in that light, and insists that 
the whitening process he abandoned. 
If that is done, the result will be that 
all sugar refined under the Commis- 
sion's new directions will be of a dis- 
tinctly yellowish shade. 



A poor old woman, who had been 
lavish where it would have been better 
to be only generous toward a neighbor, 
looked with disapproval at the scant 
amount of sugar which had been sent 
her in payment for a more liberal meas- 
ure borrowed, and remarked, "Doin' . 
ez you'd be done by is sometimes more 
satisfyin' than bein' did by, 'cause them 
that do by you don't always seem to 
sense their privileges." — Youth's Com-

Home- making. 

A man is worth from $20,000 to 
$500,000, or more, capitalizing his 
earning capacity at 5 per cent, in- 
terest. The hfe of a child is worth— 
all that one has. The home-maker 
has the care of the life, the health, 
the happiness, of these valuable bdngs. 

Isn't it worth wlule to study sys- 
tematically about hygiene, food, the 
home, management, children, — worth 
while to know the ounce of preven- 
tion more valuable than pounds of 
cure? And do you realize what a 
fascinating, inspiring subject the new 
profession of home-making is, and that 
it may be studied in your own home 
under enunent teachers at small ex- 
pense? 

If you are interested in home-mak- 
ing, send for the Bulletin of the Amer- 
ican School of Home Economics on 
"Home-making as a Profession," which 
also gives synopses of twelve subjects 
offered by correspondence and sample

Lard is no respecter 
of stomachs 



No one on this green earth can 
eat lard-soaked food day after day 
and not feel its ill effects eventually. 
You may have one of those iron- 
clad stomachs which will prove 
unsusceptihle for a time, hut the 
hog-fat and its accompanying in- 
digestibility will do its work sooner 
or later. It is an absolute fact 
that lard — simply hog-fat — is indi- 
gestible, and that it is not fit for 
the human stomach. 

Coiiolene, on the other hand, 
is made from pure, refined cotton 
seed oil — a product of nature which 
is thoroughly palatable, digestible 
and healthful. No other shorten- 
ingcoutains the digestible, nourish- 



ing and healthful qualities of 
CoUo/ene. Even pie, that night- 
mare of dyspeptics, becomes easily 
digestible when made with Cotto- 
lene. How many people can eat 
lard-laden pie ? 

Ask your regular grocer for a 
pail of Cottolene and start tomor- 
row on the way to " lardless cook- 
ery." It will insure both for 
yourself and yotir family better 
food, better digestion and better 
health. 

Cottolene shortens your food 
and lengthens your life. 

Try it according to directions 
for a few weeks and you'll never 
go back to lard. 



COTTOLENE wu gnmled aCRAND PRIZE [higbetl 
poaaikle award ) over all other cookinB fati at the 
recent Loniiiaiia Purchaae Espoiitioii ; and food 
cooked with COTTOLENE another GRAND PRIZE.

A good start for 1907 

In these days, when household expenses are mounting higher and higher, it is wise for 
people to make use of all legitimate means to keep them down without depriving them- 
selves of their accustomed comforts. One way is to avoid all forms of waste. Servants 
are apt to be wasteful, but their waste can be reduced to a minimum. Care in use of 
cooking materials, care in keeping track of expenses, care in use of left-over materials, 
— all these make for judicious economy. 


One 

way 


Household Accounts 

A simple method of recording the daily expenses of the family. The book 
contains ruled pages, systematically and simply divided into spaces, in which 
are kept the purchases for each day of milk, butter, eggs, meat, groceries, 
vegetables, etc. The daily expenses total up for the months, and the months 
for the year. There are other forms for recording expenses of help, light, 
heat, and general household expenditures in table and bed linens, china, and 
kitchen utensils, etc. 

Bound in manila boards. Price, 25 cents. 


Another 
way 


Made-over Dishes 

By Mrs. S. T. RoRBR. A good book, showing bow to transform the leftovers 
into wholesome and palatable dishes. There is no thought of meanness in 
this, but a wise and practicable economy that saves many a dollar. 

Bound in cloth. Price, 50 cents. 


Still 
another 

* 


Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book 

A great, big, handsome book, beautifully illustrated. Over 700 pages of the 
best recipes and directions for good living ever made. Your cook, however 
inexperienced, can follow this book and never make mistakes. Every recipe, 
if followed, is bound to come out right Here is an important saving. 
Nothing to be done over. 

Bound in cloth. Price, $2 ; by mail, $2.20. 


And 

one 

more 


Every Day Menu Book 

By Mrs. S. X. RORKR 

Now is the time to commence with this book. It has a menu for every 
meal In the year, arranged by months and days. This portion covers the 
first 193 pages. Then comes a bewildering array of good things for all 
occasions. The entire field of social functions is ably and amply covered, — 
weddings, receptions, breakfasts, teas, luncheons, etc. Beautiful full-page 
illustrations of decorated tables are given, showing how to arrange for holidays, 
sporting events, weddings, etc. Full directions how to carry out the deco- 
rative ideas accompany the pictures, and then follows the menu for the meal. 
Very full and complete. 

Bound in cloth. Price, $1.50; by mail, $1.62. 


Sold by all booksellers or by us.

Harvard's Foster Child 

The One Woman's College whose Ripe Scholarship is attested by 

the Great University 

By Mrs. Charles Norman 



ONE day in late September, when 
the shadows of evening were 
falling and the rain drizzling 
down upon old Fay House in Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts, a young woman 
arrived, to apply for admission to the 
"Harvard Annex." She was travel- 
stained and weary. She had come 
from a far-distant State of the South- 
west, and, being entirely unannounced, 
her appearance occasioned some sur- 
prise to the secretary, who was about 
to close the office for the night. 

*'What shall we do with her, Miss 
Coes?" said Mr. Oilman. The ap- 
plicant waited, thinking of Mr. Dick's 
reply to Aunt Betsy Trotwood when 
David Copperfield was presenting him- 
self for their charity. She expected 
Miss Coes to say, **Wash her face." 
Miss Coes refrained, however, and, 
writing an address upon a card, 
handed it to the young woman, ex- 
plaining that she would find at the 
place indicated a temporary residence, 
and saying, *'Come to the office to- 
morrow." 

That "to-morrow" will never be 
forgotten by one woman. It was as 
if she had suddenly been dropped upon 
a new world. She had come from a 



sunny, summery land to find that 
autumn had already settled down upon 
Eastern Massachusetts. She had left a 
provincial little town, where she knew 
every one and thought herself the peer 
of any. And she felt she was the least 
among them all. 

The walk to Fay House led past the 
home of Longfellow and on under the 
old elm where Washington took com- 
mand of the American army. Occupy- 
ing the whole centre of Cambridge and 
a good deal of the outlying territory 
was Harvard University. Just across 
the river was Boston, while Concord, 
Salem, Lexington, and Plymouth were 
next door. 

Half the names seemed to have come 
out of text-books on American litera- 
ture or history. History was no longer 
a volume to be studied, but a panorama 
to be looked at. The gods, after all, 
did not dwell upon the mountain tops, 
but were here mingling with the people. 
The promised land had been discovered, 
after weary voyaging, and the explorer 
stood with one foot upon its border, 
impatient to go on. 

Her experience was not essentially 
different from that of others who 
had preceded her in this pilgrimage.

spirit without a body, a real college, ing to their brothers. Harvard! Magic 
having nothing it could call its own, word ! Tlie first English college of the 
not even instructors. But there was new world and the pride of the country! 
something intangible which it did Yet only indirectly could it mean 
possess, and that was a high standard anything at all to women. Perhaps 
of scholarship and an unrivalled aim, the men, who had been rather selfishly

satisfied with their moQopoly, began to 
feel a little embarrassed as the cry for 
woman's instruction became m'gent, 
and public opinion grew in sympathy. 
One girl, who had gone to Cambridge 
some time previous, and who had been 
privately tutored by Professors Green- 
ough. Child, and Goodwin, had showed 
such abUity, such keen appreciation and 
earnestness, that these gentlemen be- 
came irredeemably enthusiastic over 
the instruction of women in general. 

Indeed, higher education for women, 
whether desirable in itself or not, 



All practical arrangements were left 
to a board of women managers, a tal- 
ented company, of which Mrs. Agassiz, 
wife of the great naturalist, was the 
president. At length, through the wis- 
dom and devotion of its projectors, 
there resulted a corporation, a well- 
arranged course of study with excellent 
teachers, and a few buildings ; and the 
institution came to be known generally 
by its nickname, "Harvard Annex." 

Such was its simple and natural 
history. People who did not under- 
stand and whose sympathies were al- 



Bertiam Hali. (Hall of Residence) 



seemed necessary, as 90 per cent, of 
the teachers in the large cities were 
women, who felt the deepest need of 
richer, more abundant knowledge. Ac- 
cordingly, in 1878, when it was pro- 
posed that Harvard should give syste- 
matic though unofGcial teaching to 
women, a large number of the professors 
expressed a willingness to undertake the 
work, stipulating clearly that "no in- 
struction was to be provided of a lower 
grade than that in Harvard College," 
and that ' ' the examinations at entrance 
and at every subsequent stage were to 
be identical with those of the college." 



together with the young women, wanted 
to know why Harvard did not open its 
doors to women or incorporate bodily 
this new organization. Either step 
was practically impossible and wholly 
unwise. The University was not pre- 
pared to receive a large number of 
women without crippling its facilities 
for the instruction of men; and its 
president and fellows, already too 
heavily burdened, could not add so 
greatly to administrative work or 
attend to necessary details. Then there 
was the conservatism of a three-cent- 
ury-old institution, whose rich bequests

bad been, m many cases, spedfically 
bestowed for the education of men. 
Moreover, it was often forgotten that 
there are other phases of college life 



At this time the Harvard Annex found 
itself a name, — that of the first woman 
who had ever given a scholarship to 
Harvard, — and " Radcliffe " College was 



Brown and Nicholi Buildin 



besides the academic, and that a board 
of managers, composed at least partly 
of women, is best prepared to super- 
intend^the households and to provide 
the proper conditions for young women 
away from home. 

Perhaps there was no woman in 
America better equipped by circum- 
stances and personal qualities for direct- 
ing such a body than Mrs. Agassiz, who 
had been a wise mother to the students, 
and still, in her eighty -fourth year, 
holds the place of honorary president. 
She had, from the beginning, the ut- 
most faith in the Annex, and it was 
her desire to keep it as closely as possible 
related to the University. The in- 
structors were, therefore, given as 
much authority as they were willing 
to assume. 

The Harvard library, of 500,000 
volumes was at the disposal of the 
young women. Harvard furnished all 
the teaching force and regulated the 
standards of scholarship; but it was 
not until 1894 that the University 
assumed definite and official relations. 



incorporated under the laws of Massa- 
chusetts. By this charter Radcliffe 
grants its own degrees, and its diplomas 
are countersigned by the president of 
Harvard, who affixes also the seal of 
the University. 

There was a jubilee in Radcliffe 
when this important news was an- 
nounced, and there was a deal of jest 
and jollity among the students in 
Harvard. The Harvard Lampoon 
printed a striking cartoon representing 
a marriage ceremony between a robust 
and prosperous gentleman — John Har- 
vard — and a lean, awkward woman 
called Ann Radcliffe. The paper gave 
also, under the inspiration of some 
droll muse, a summary of all the direful 
changes which would take place in the 
University "since Radcliffe had en- 
tered the fold." 

But Radcliffe, after an hour of 
revelry, got back into workaday ways 
and went steadily on its scholarly road, 
remembering its dignified past and 
reaching forth with the greatest ex- 
pectations to the future. In the twelve 



Harvard's Foster Child 



365 



years that have elapsed since then she 
has been kept busy meeting the ever- 
increasing demands upon her. She has 
built a new gymnasium, a students' 
bouse, a hall of residence, and "the 
Brown and Nichols building." In ad- 
dition, she has purchased Greenleaf 
estate and other property, thus making 
great progress of a brick and mortar 
kind. Laboratories for physics, chem- 
istry, botany, and biology have been 
equipped, and two other important 
buildings are well under way. 

Indeed, there have been so many 
improvements that old students are 
beginning to feel anxious, and they are 
importuning that the corridors and the 
drawing-rooms at Fay House be spared 
unaltered; for to those who lived in 
the golden, olden days no point of 
change in RadcUffe can be as interesting 
as the points wherein she is unchanged. 
She must grow, to be sure; but still 
they hope that she will remain her 
old self. 



Agassiz. The fund for the erection of 
this "house" was a gift from the 
family and friends of Mrs. Agassiz, and 
the announcement of it came to her as 
a surprise on the morning of her eighti- 
eth birthday. It was certainly an 
evidence of high esteem, expressed in 
the most beautiful and rational way, 
that in her honor nearly $200,000 had • 
been spontaneously contributed to the 
cause in which she was most interested. 
The building is not intended for 
academic purposes, but for relaxation 
and intelligent and stimulating social 
intercourse. It is connected by an 
arcade with the gymnasium, and the 
two together aSord sufficient room 
for any function which Radclifife is 
likely to have in many years. Agassiz 
House has a lunch-room, accommodat- 
ing two hundred, club-rooms, parlors, 
rest-rooms, auditorium, and hospitable 
halls. Miss Alice Longfellow, the 
daughter of the poet, whose name has 
always been associated with the college,

of affection for the college, can fail in 
appreciation of a building bearing the 
distinguished name of CUzabeth Cary

mittee, which has charge of the social 
life. No one has felt their needs more 
than she, and no one appreciates more

the present and future benefit of the 
Agassiz Building. Of the palatial par- 
lor Miss I^ngfellow said affectionately, 
"This is the heart of the house." It is 
the family sitting-room, with great 
open fireplaces, piano, and other ap- 
purtenances for luxurious sociability. 
It is a superb place for dancing and for 
■ assembling to sing those operatic airs 
which seem to be at Raddiffe a safety- 
valve preventing the calamitous re- 
sults of too much philosophy. 

Another important feature of the 
building is its auditorium. Here are 



zeal none too common in the University, 
though the stimuli, acting upon the 
two bodies of students, are almost 
identical.) Then, too, it should be 
borne in mind that no institution of 
learning open to women does a higher 
grade of work than Raddiffe. There- 
fore, the greater necessity for relaxation. 
It is not a part of the plan that the 
path of glory shall lead but to the grave. 
There are certain things which Rad- 
diffe seems foreordained and inspired 
to accomplish; but, since she exists to 
satisfy a demand, not to create one. 



presented lectures and musicales, not 
to mention theatricals, which have for 
centuries hdd a conspicuous place 
among classical students. 

The lighter side of college life, being 
more conspicuous, sometimes appears 
to the pubhc disproportionately de- 
vdoped. It must be remembered, how- 
ever, that a woman who is concerned 
solely with scholarly achievement is 
sadly unprepared for the place she is 
likely to fill in the outside world. 
Besides, there is among college women 
a lamentable tendency to overwork

marked in their Raddiffe d asses a 



she avoids publidty. And, having 
within her the essence of greatness, 
every act is characterized by modesty. 
So far as is discernible, she has no 
jealousies, nor is she the object of 
jealousy. This is natural, since her 
position is scarcdy similar to that of 
any other American institution. Not 
that Knowledge has to Raddiffe's eyes 
alone unrolled "her ample page," hut 
Raddiffe has the double advantage of 
being situated upon dassic ground and 
of being surrounded by great leaders of 
thought. 

Inspiration that comes from contact 
with great minds is, after all, of far

more consequence than formal instruc- 
tion. Half of the teaching may miss 
the mark and fail of full appreciation, 
but there is something in spirit that 
leaps from mind to mind, setting the 
faculties on fire. ''Power has gone 
out of me" may well be asserted by any 
original thinker. 

About one hundred and twenty of the 
instructors and professors of Harvard, in- 
cluding many of the most distinguished, 
are now engaged in teaching at Raddiif e. 
In addition to this a large number of 
graduate courses in Harvard are open 
to Raddiffe graduates. So that there, 
are, at present, over two hundred 
courses of instruction open to women. 
Taking it all in all, the opportunities 
Raddiffe offers are truly wonderful. 

In 1902 the college first granted the 
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, thus 
increasing her honors and likewise her 



responsibilities, since the expense of 
instruction for this degree is very great. 
At that time Mr. Gray, of the Raddiffe 
Council, dedared that the college cotild 
immediately, and to great advantage, 
use half a million dollars in increasing 
her teaching force. 

Meantime, women are going to Cam- 
bridge from all over the world for a 
Idsurdy course of study, satisfied that 
"the bits of ambrosia and manna can 
be foimd nowhere better than there." 
When they return to their homes, to 
occupy, as many of them may, the 
normal sphere of average women, they 
will not fill those places in the ordinary 
way, but with broader vision, multiplied 
resources, and perfected judgment. It 
is believed, also, that the dear intelli- 
gence which hdps them solve the prob- 
lems of their own lives will shed light 
upon the needs of humanity.

New Year's Day 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



NEW YEAR'S DAY is the 
universal birthday which be- 
longs to each one of us, and 
yet it recks not how the little progeny 
of earth feels towards it. We, in turn, 
meet its recurrence with philosophy, 
dread, or bright anticipation according 
to our individual circumstances. 

No longer is it ushered in by gifts, 
as in the days when Christmas was 
surreptitiously observed or wholly ig- 
nored by all but church people. But 
the gifts were needed then to lessen 
the austerity that too often clung to 
it. The chosen hymn, which frightened 
children were compelled to sing, told 
them to 

"Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master appear." 

No fear of the next world could exceed 
their terror of a possible perpetual mo- 
tion here or until the Judgment Day. 
The lines had their value, just as has the 
familiar stanza of ' 'Now I lay me down 
to sleep," etc. Yet an unknown dread 
lay concealed in the meaning of the 
adult hymn as it does in the third line 
of the children's prayer. 

New Year's Day was also heralded 
by the making of resolutions to last 
through the coming twelve months. Of 
course they did not, but all the same 
we were told to make them, and we did. 
Sometimes we compared notes to see 
who had made the most or the best. 
Porttmately, that annual mania has 
subsided into a daily prayer for strength 
without partictdarizing special ways 
for its employment, and the morbid 
self -analysis has become a thing of the 
past. 

Now we try to think of New Year's 
Day as marking time for science and the 
centtuies, and as having nothing to do 
with our moral consciousness. But, 
alas! we cannot get rid of it as the 



annual incubus that falls upon us 
against our volition. So we make the 
best of it, as being all well enough for 
the young and active, though secretly 
feeling that to those who are growing 
elderly it is as bad as a personal birth- 
day. It is no fun to be a year older, 
and one is so often and so regularly! 
Rabbi Ben Ezra must have been quite 
young when he sang to others to 

"Grow old along with me I 
The best is yet to be." 

Yet the keeping up of appearances 
and the sense of a fictitious youth is 
as disagreeable as a senile old age. The 
way some old people are not wanted 
round, when it comes to facts rather 
than to theories, is discomforting. 
Of course there are hundreds of old 
persons whose presence brings blessings. 
Yet just to be treated with respect 
is forlorn! When one is not needed, 
one has lived long enough. Who, 
nowadays, cares for old-fashioned 
experience and advice, unless it is 
hidden in an historical romance ? Our 
young folk prefer to work out their 
own salvation, and, somehow, they 
generally do it so effectively that each 
New Year is better than the last old 
one. 

Fortunately, the New Year for us all 
is coupled with so much athletics, golf 
and rowing for the old, and football 
and tennis for the young, that, though 
we cannot help growing older, we are 
vigorous and do not want to be waited 
upon, and are confident that our Ameri- 
can men and women a generation 
hence will be as active and prominent 
as are so many elderly persons in Eng- 
land to-day. It is only in the United 
States that women, who have passed 
the sex attractiveness of youth, have 
to take a back seat. 

Growing old age, in order to keep 



New Year's Day 



269 



itself young, must, however, be com- 
panioned with hobbies. There is no 
remedy equal to having a hobby, in 
order to keep agile mentally, for, even 
if thereby one bores others, one does 
not bore one's self, and that is much 
more important. Don't let a woman 
ever give up housekeeping or the care 
of a garden and of hens and chickens 
as long as she can hobble. Window- 
boxes answer when greenhouses can't 
be owned, and experiments are always 
in order. Lately, in London, a speci- 
men of orchid, it is said, sold for $7,000. 
'* Breeding did it." Yet anybody can 
transplant and grow things from slips. 

This taking of pleasure in one's own 
small, quiet creations need not be 
obtrusive. Moreover, it is by the 
baptism of labor each year that we 
stave off old age, — a ceremonial of the 
heart which to ourselves is as sacred 
as was to two Chicago parents the dedi- 
cation of their child to the cause of 
labor, they declaring they would so 
direct its education as to **best serve 
the cause of organized labor. . . . until 
the child is old enough to take upon 
himself the sacred obligations entered 
into by his parents." The father 
wisely added that the child was **not 
necessarily dedicated to leadership. . . . 
If time finds him working in the ranks of 
union labor, we shall be satisfied, and 
if, on the other hand, he should turn out 
to be a leader of men, laboring for the 
cause of better wages and the improve- 
ment of working conditions, his par- 
ents will be devoutly thankful." The 
service was as sincere, solemn, and beau- 
tiful as was another ceremony, when 
a baby was ''donated" to the cause 
of the Salvation Army. 

The striking point in both services 
is their indication of the bias of the 
present times, and of the young es- 
pecially, to organization and specializa- 
tion in work. It is not a new develop- 
ment, for the Guilds of the Middle Ages 
were rent with narrowing divisions, 
but merely a proof of the recurrence 



of what has been to what shall be again. 
Also is it an illustration of the personal 
difference between youth arid age. 
Youth advocates specialties and or- 
ganizations. Old age accepts general 
conclusions, private endeavors, and 
humbly hopes where youth pledges. 
Youth looks upon each New Year as 
a special happening or foresees it as a 
crucial time. Old age takes it as a 
matter of course, something that can- 
not be prevented, and knows that, in 
spite of joys promised or fears realized, 
it will turn out to have been just an 
average year of ups and downs. 

Still, it will have new fads, especially 
in Boston, and rejuvenated problems 
to be solved by composite philanthropy, 
and politics to be purified and official- 
ism to be sloughed off. Yet all the 
way along will courtesy and integrity 
break through baneful influences, till, 
looking back after a few more New 
Years, it will be acknowledged that the 
real progress towards better tendencies 
and accomplishments came from indi- 
vidual striving. 

Only we won't grow old as the years 
pass on, for we will not let ourselves 
fall into a passive way of drifting and 
of being busy doing nothing. 

We might adopt President Hyde's 
"new platform for Christians," that 
consists of 21 **We wills" and not one 
"We believe." But Professor William 
James's insistence upon the "Will to 
believe," though not as powerful an 
antidote against doctrinal theology 
as President Hyde's remedy, is a sure 
way to keep ourselves young at heart. 

The sentiment with which the New 
Year has been invested comes chiefly 
from women and ministers. The former 
use it as an occasion for good resolu- 
tions, teas and visits, the latter as an 
opportunity for spiritual counsel. 
Whereas men of every-day good sense 
regard the day as a matter of business, 
when accounts must be squared. 

Midway between sentiment and busi- 
ness lies the simple-hearted cordiality,

which wishes each one a Happy New 
Year, — an old and true custom that adds 
to the amenities of life, and costs nothing 
but the effort to forget one's self and 
not to be at odds with everybody else. 
However provoked many of us may 
be that we are not better off or happier,

Aunt Elinor's Visit 

By Winifred Langworthy Brown 



FROM childhood a visit from 
Aunt Elinor was always hailed 
by the household with delight. 
I suppose the explanation for this lay 
in the fact that Aunt Elinor under- 
stood to a T the knack of being **all 
things to all men." She always seemed 
to know by instinct the best games 
for children, the nicest fairy stories, 
the best ways of cooking and prepar- 
ing food, the most novel ideas of en- 
tertaining, or the newest ideas in 
fancy work. 

The very traits which had made us 
all love Aunts Elinor just now made me 
almost, not quite, — ^for no one could 
quite dread Aunt Elinor, — almost, 
I say, dread her prospective visit. 
For Jack and I had been housekeep- 
ing only two short tnonths, and there 
was so much yet to learn. I knew 
Aunt Elinor would be just the one to 
help me at my weak points, but it is 
very human in a young housekeeper 
to desire that no one except the "only 
man" shall know about all the mis- 
takes. He knows themjall, of course, 
because, if by chance*^ there are any 
which he doesn't see, "^ she thinks it 
necessary to tell him.||^That seems a 
part of the perfect understanding.? 

But Aunt Elinor was coming,^and 
she must not guess that there^had 
been the tiniest suspicion of regret 



at the time of the visit. She would 
arrive on the five o'clock train, so, 
having put everjrthing in my small 
domain in its best array, and planned 
and prepared my dinner as far as 
possible beforehand, — ^for I was my 
own maid, — I was ready to greet 
Aunt Elinor with what must have 
been to her an amusing assumption 
of my new-found dignity as hostess 
in my own home. 

We had not seen her since our 
wedding journey; and she had been 
spending some time among relatives 
in Western Kansas, so there was much 
to tell and hear on both sides. After 
dinner, leaving Jack to act the host, 
I put the kitchen and dining-room 
in order; and then we three had a 
long, pleasant evening together. Aunt 
Elinor understood enough about busi- 
ness to get Jack talking of his firm 
and recent promotion. freely; and she 
evinced, as always, a quick and ready 
sympathy in another's success. When 
I showed auntie to the guest-room 
on which I had lavished much atten- 
tion to make it suggest wholesome 
daintiness, she said: '*Now, Alice, 
I want you to forget from this mo- 
ment that I am* a guest. It is not so 
long that I have forgotten my first 
housekeeping experiences, and now 
I mean to renew them with you." 



Aunt Elinor's Visit 



271 



That is how it happened that there- 
after during the visit Aunt Elinor was 
manager-in-chief. The simplest dishes 
served as she would serve them, and 
with an accompaniment which seemed 
to marshal itself in proper array under 
the skilful touch of her fingers, made 
cooking seem, not a hidden mystery, 
but a series of delights. Though she 
would permit no extra expenditures 
on her account, her management gave 
to commonest food a Delmonican air. 

For breakfast we had only oranges, 
cereal, with a chop or poached tgg 
on toast; but there was always a 
delicious accompaniment of lettuce 
with mayonnaise or radish with a 
dressing of its own, the appearance of 
which was - so dainty as to garnish, 
as it were, the whole breakfast, and 
the taste of which no one but a bom 
cook need dream. "Much depends on 
the flavor in cooking," was one of 
Aunt Elinor's proverbs. **The dif- 
ference between flavor and its lack is 
the difference between good and bad 
cooking," she would say. 

When we prepared fish, — for I learned 
her secrets as far as a novice might, — 
she would buy the cheapest kind, 
remove the skin, cut into square 
pieces, and fry in fat until brown. 
These squares she served surrounded 
b3r smaU potato balls, also fried a 
delicate brown. The balls were cut 
with a potato-cutter; and the trim- 
mings, instead of being thrown away 
as useless, as I should have done, 
were - thrown into a basin of water, 
to be boiled later, when, mashed and 
mixed with a well-beaten egg and 
milk, they made delicious croquettes. 

At another time boiled flounders, 
broken into snowy flakes and mixed 
with hard-boiled eggs, chopped and 
well seasoned, were arranged on a 
large, flat dish, and surrounded by 
a circular lagoon of mashed potato. 
Over the fish was poured a creamy 
sauce, and the potato mound was 
covered with a coating of white of 



egg. This was browned most deli- 
cately by holding above it for a few 
moments a heated frying-pan. At a 
cost not exceeding 20 cents was thus 
prepared a dish to grace any dinner 
and tempt the appetite of an epicure. 

The remains of fruit or sauce under 
Aunt Elinor's mesmeric touch dis- 
appeared to all intents from the face 
of the earth, and none but a French 
cook might have guessed that they 
formed the toothsome centre of the 
square mould of rice which served as 
next day's dessert. 

A chestnut pudding, such as 1 
never tasted elsewhere, was made one 
day from the remains of the quart of 
chestnuts which Jack brought home 
from the market, tempted by their 
shiny, satiny, brown jackets. After 
being shelled, these were boiled for 
ten minutes, put in cold water, and 
the brown skins removed. Then they 
were placed in the stewpan, covered 
with a quart of milk, and left to stew 
slowly until the nuts were softened. 
Then the addition of a pinch of salt, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, two of 
flour mixed in a little cold milk and 
stirred until thickened, and fifteen 
minutes' baking, made a most appe- 
tizing pudding. 

Another delicious dessert, and eco- 
nomical as well, was made bv toast- 
ing slices of stale sponge cake, and cov- 
ering each with whipped cream, in 
the centre of which was placed a tea- 
spoonful of apple jelly. This had been 
made the day before from a half- 
dozen red Astrachan apples. 

* 'Let's have fried oysters for dinner 
to-night, auntie," I said one night. 
* * Jack just adores fried oysters. ' ' Here, 
too, I learned there is a right and a 
wrong way. Instead of rolling the 
oysters in egg and crumbs. Aunt Eli- 
nor washed, then dried them thor- 
oughly with a towel. She dipped 
them first before frying in mayonnaise 
dressing, then in cracker crumbs. The 
mayonnaise gave them just the right 



272 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



flavor, and Jack pronounced them 
the finest he ever ate. Since the cook 
was Aunt Elinor, I forgave him. 

One day at dinner, when we had 
invited the families-in-law on both 
sides, an involuntary exclamation broke 
forth at the appearance of the vegetable 
salad. Yet its ingredients were most 
simple. Seven or eight cold, boiled po- 
tatoes, one large or three or four small 
onions, a root of celery, and a crisp cu- 
cumber, chopped fine, were mixed 
with four or five fine-minced, cold, 
boiled eggs, and well smothered with 
cream mayonnaise. A dozen or more 
smooth, ripe tomatoes had been se- 
lected; and, after cutting away the 
stem end, pulp and seeds had been 
removed with a teaspoon. This, by 
the way, had been boiled, salted, and 
sealed in glass jars, and set aside to 
form the basis for futiu*e tomato soups. 
The perfectly ripe tomatoes, glowing 
red, had been stuffed with the salad, 
and surmounted by a spoonful of 
whipped cream. Its snowy white- 
ness overtopping the deep scarlet 
of the tomato delighted the eye 
as much as the salad pleased the 
palate. 

Not alone in preparation of particu- 
lar dishes did my aunt's skill keep 
me in a continual state of wonder 
that one small head could carry all 
she knew, but in all the departments 
of kitchen lore and household wisdom. 
It was by her suggestion that I learned 
to use a silver knife when paring apples 
or other acid fruit, thus avoiding 
blackening the hands. From watch- 
ing her, I formed the habit of always 
adding salt to the water in * which 
vegetables are to be boiled. 

**To remove the disagreeable odor 
from your kitchen after cooking," 
Aunt Elinor said one day, when we 
had been cooking new cabbage, *'just 
open the windows. Now pour in a basin 
a pint of boiling water." While I 
was obeying her instructions, she 



brought a few drops of oil of lavender, 
and poured into the water. "Now 
just carry the basin about the room 
two or three times, and you'll find 
all the objectionable odors have van- 
ished." And, true enough, not a ves- 
tige of cabbage remained. 

"Have you some small, dean white 
blotters?" asked auntie one evening, 
as I was whipping cream for the 
pudding. When I brought them, what 
was my surprise to see her whisk two 
or three sheets lightly over the top 
of the soup! *'Why do you do that?" 
I asked. ** Can't you guess?" **It 
must be to remove the fat globules, 
isn't it? I never saw it done before." 
"See how clear my soup looks now," 
she said; and I saw that none of the 
wee spherules so often seen floating 
on soup were to be seen. They had 
all been absorbed by the blotter. 

One morning, when we had been 
for a walk the afternoon before, and 
had been caught in a shower, auntie 
walked into the kitchen with a black 
serge skirt thrown over her shoulder, 
and calmly began paring a potato. 
Having become somewhat accus- 
tomed to her surprises, I asked no 
questions, but watched developments. 
Cutting the potato in half, she rubbed 
it over the mud stains around the 
bottom of her skirt, as she continued 
occasionally cutting away slices of 
the potato. When all the mud had 
been removed, she sponged the spots 
with alcohol and ammonia; and the 
skirt was as good as new. 

At the end of a month Aunt Eli- 
nor's stay came to a dose; and, as 
Jack and I stood on the platform 
waving good-bye until Christmas, 
which she had promised to spend with 
us, we felt as if "half the house was 
gone," as Jack expressed it. But, 
though she had gone, I could not 
but treasure in my housekeeper's soul 
the wealth of wisdom which her visit 
had suggested. 



The Wisdom of Being Behind Time 

By Lee McCrae 



TO be '^forehanded/' to have 
one's summer wardrobe made 
in February and all the winter 
sewing done by Thanksgiving, — these 
words have a thrifty sound, and for long 
centuries they have been the gospel of 
prudence" and thrift preached to women 
by other women. 

But here is one who has turned here- 
tic, — driven to it by sad experience. 
Hear me ! • 

Spring seems to get later each year. 
We have the uncomfortable habit of 
looking for it and violets about Saint 
Valentine's Day, but they never really 
arrive until Easter time, and hardly 
then in our northern climates. I al- 
most murdered myself once upon a time 
by wearing a summery dress on Easter 
Sunday just because the calendar and 
some poor, misguided robins said it was 
spring. Dear girls, don't tempt your- 
selves tuberculosis- ward by having thin 
dresses too handy in the fickle spring 
weather ! 

But, aside from health, the forehand- 
edness may put us in the out-of-style 
columns in July and August days. 
Fashions in February are suggestive, 
experiments if you will. Dame Fashion 
is really not as autocratic as we accredit 
her with being. She puts out many 
things at the beginning of a season that 
bluster about as though they would be 
sure-enough leaders, but, failing to 
meet popular approval, lo ! they are not. 
So an early-made gown may have fol- 
lowed a fad that has proven a will-o'- 
the-wisp long ere September comes, and 
September with her high-toned temper- 
ature is fairly entitled to rank with the 
summer months. 

Nor is there economy in the early 
sewing. The first display of a season's 
goods always marks high water in 
prices, and while one loves to have 
' 'first pick," as children say, that counts 



for little unless the buyer lives in a 
small town. The city shops are full the 
year round with fresh goods of aU text- 
ures, so that it has become merely a 
question of when do you wish to buy 
and at what prices. ICnowing that the 
rush for thin goods is over with June, 
and for furs, cloaks, and fancy goods 
with the passing of the holidays, the 
merchants, wishing to *'tiUTi their 
money over," hold July and January 
sales that are well worth attending. 

To patronize millinery sales at these 
times is almost making money. If a 
woman can limit herself to an inexpen- 
sive street hat in the spring (aided by last 
year's dress hat fixed up afresh), then, 
when the summer slaughter begins, she 
can purchase handsome headgear for 
half it would have cost at Easter. And, 
besides the saving in cash, it will be a 
much more becoming hat, for the mil- 
liner is not too rushed to take a personal 
interest in it, and the buyer has had 
time to study the new shapes and 
shades and select those that really be- 
long to her. 

*'0, but what about Easter?" wails a 
young girl. 

Dear, you are behind in good form. 
Haven't you noticed of late that the 
best class of women — ^and the ranks are 
swelling — are dressing more quietly for 
Easter Sunday? It has become too 
"kitchen-girly," just as it was always 
unchristian, to make more of clothes 
than of the beautiful Easter thought. 
Women now take pains to wear new 
things the Sunday before or the Sunday 
after. 

The late bu)dng and making has an- 
other advantage. If a seamstress is 
employed, she will come to you after 
the rush at a reduced rate, most likely, 
and, not being hurried, she will un- 
doubtedly give you better service. If 
you do your own sewing, you will find 



174 



The Boston Cooking-School Magaziiie 



it more comfortable to be sitting on a 
veranda whipping lace to an organdy 
flounce,, than to be doing any other work 
on a hot July day. You feel useful, the 
dress grows without perceptible effort, 
and it is just as good fancy work as em- 
broidering a superfluous doily. 

In the fall it is surely sacrilege to 
spend the glorious days — ^the very last 
outdoor daysl — cooped up with a ma- 
chine, trying to get the winter cloth- 
ing ready by Thanksgiving. Besides, 
all charitable hearts are pondering 
Christmas and the long lists of friends 
with ominous blanks opposite their 
names. But when Christmas .is over, 
when curtains of snow and drizzly rain 
shut us in to home warmth and devices 
of our own, ah I then how we love the 
touch of soft wool goods that we may 
be fashioning leisurely into a gown that 
will be needed for weeks and weeks to 



come 1 And the fact that we bought it 
at ''one-third off" will not lessen our 
satisfaction. 

So dear, sensible woman, fall out of 
the hurry ranks, the fl3ring van-guard, 
and bring up the rear with me. Unless 
you are going away early in the summer 
(you notice the late going is far more 
fashionable now), and unless you have 
nothing at all to wear during the holi- 
day festivities, put off the sewing and 
outfitting, and see if you are not the 
gainer thereby. Your crisp organdies 
will make the other girls' washed-out 
dresses look frightful when next Sept- 
tember comes, your brand-new wool 
gowns will be a triumph and brighten 
the dull spring days for you, while your 
pocket-book will, look as though it, too, 
had taken deep-breathing exercises in 
the autumn air. Try it, and see if I am 
not justified in my heresy. 



The Wonder Book 

By Marjorie McClure 



Dolly Nuewed has a book 

By which she's told just how to cook. 

For she has now begun to try 

To bake and broil and steam and fry. 

This cook book's said to be complete 
In recipes for soups and meat, 
Cakes and pastries, salads, jam, 
And even curing beef and ham. 

To serve with veal, one Tuesday night, 
DoUy wished some dumpling light. 
According to the wonder book, 
She flour, eggs, and water took. 

It also said, "Add salt to taste. 
With water make like pancake paste." 
But Dolly wouldn't taste the mess, 
And so she added salt by guess. 



fi 



It was too salt, it wa& too tough, 

Of water she'd not used enough. 

So sought the pancake rule to know, — 

It was, "Like dumpling make the dough. 

Next making custard brought her woe. 
The rule read, "Cook and stir just so 
It comes up only to a boil. 
Or it wiU curdle then and spoil" 

She stirred and watched with eager eye, 
She meant the boiling-point to spy, 
But, ere she did this recognize, 
It bubbled and was on the rise. 



She saw and knew, but all too late: 
The custard had met evil fate. 
And now the bridegroom fondly plagues, 
And calls her custard scrambled eggs. 



'Twas so with mint sauce, pie, and cake. 
With cottage cheese and Hamburg steak; 
But Dolly keeps this useful book. 
That she may see how not to cook.

October 27, in Aberdeen, at the quarter- 
centenary of Aberdeen University, one 
of the largest banquets on record. 
King Edward was present at the ban- 
quet, as also a very large number of 
distinguished people : in all 2,500 guests 
were present. Kitchens installed with 
steam, electricity, and water, in which 
to cook the feast, had to be erected, as 
also a dining-room, with storeroom 
for food, china, and silver. The chair-

Facing this, on a lower level, were 72 
tables, and on a lower level still 72 other 
tables. Between the tables ran broad 
avenues, through which the guests

ceived $50,000 for his undertaking. 
He brought with him 800 cooks, waiters, 
superintendents, and porters, for whom 
food and sleeping accommodations 
had to be provided. An idea of the 
magnitude of the affair can be gotten 
from the facts that for the soup 90 



turtles, weighing 6,000 pounds, were 
imported from the West Indies, and 
that the silver, glass, china, and linen 
weighed 45 tons. The feature of note 
at this banquet was the excellence of 
the service, the 2,500 guests being 
served a formal banquet in as perfect 
a manner as if only 200 guests had been 
present. 



Baking Beans in the Orient 

By George Rice 



MY frien4s in the baking pro- 
fession are asking me ques- 
tions about baked beans in 
some of the foreign lands which I 
have visited. It was my privilege to 
spend several years in the Philip- 
pines, Japan, Borneo, Guam, Hono- 
lulu, and other places of the Bast. 
I noticed that canned beans were im- 
ported from the United States and 
European countries. I also observed 
that the bakeries of the countries 
mentioned devoted time and space to 
baking beans, just as some of the bak- 
eries in this country bake beans on 
Saturday nights for the people. But 
the baking-houses of the Philippines 
and Japan are very different from 
the modem bake-shops. It is true 
that a number of American bakers 
have opened shops in Manila and 
in: the important cities and towns 
of Japan, and even in China. But 
the American baker in foreign lands 
is handicapped. 

Let us look at a bakery in the 
Philippines. The American boss has 
to depend upon native labor to a cer- 
tain extent. He cannot do all the 
work himself; and he cannot afford 
to hire very many Americans, because 
the American baker gets high wages 
there. As the proprietor can obtain 
Filipino and Chinese coolie labor for 



40 to 50 cents per day each man, 
he is tempted to hire this class, and 
undertakes to break them in. It is 
a hard proposition. They work a 
little, then make an excuse of illness 
at home, mother dead, etc., just to 
get away and loaf a few days, while 
the bake-shop struggles on short- 
handed. 

One baker fitted up a number of 
nipa shacks near his shop, and man- 
aged to keep the native bakers at 
work fairly steadily by keeping their 
families near, and entertaining them 
every evening with cock fights and 
kindred sports. The people of the 
Orient are fast being educated up to 
eating American baked beans. There 
is quite a market for Boston baked 
beans, and one sees the sign out very 
often. But the beans that appear on 
sale as Boston baked beans are not 
infrequently of very poor grade. 

I had an opportunity to test the 
baked beans in different places; and, 
while some were good, others were 
burned or not baked enough. The 
native bakers of the Philippines are 
inclined to bum the beans. They 
are almost always impregnated with 
smoke, and taste of the utensil in which 
they were baked. The art of baking 
is not understood. When an Amer- 
ican is in charge, he sees to it that 



178 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



the proper ovens are erected, and 
that the fires are kept up, and the 
baking done according to a fixed plan. 
But even then the American boss 



n 



n

BEANS

J^n JBoncluh . 



cannot always be present, consequently 
the beans are often ruined during the 
preparation. 

The Filipino and the Japanese baker 
are neglectful. They have some sub- 
stantial oven erected with stone and 
masonry, but they fail to manage the 
same aright. The attendants have 
a habit of falling asleep at critical 
times .in the operation of baking, 
and much of the product of the shop 
is spoiled in this way. The bake- 
house of the native is usually very 
small. Often the ovens are entirely 
exposed to the elements, and the at- 
tendants seek seclusion under little 
shelters built in the vicinity. 

Some of the modem bake-houses 
of Japan and the Philippines are 
roomy, with shelves and dresser on 
one side, and properly fitted troughs, 
with sluice-boards on the other. Yet 
the poor management of the shop 
results in the turning out of poor 
bread and unevenly baked beans. 
The oven usually occupies the third 
side of the shop. This is often con- 



structed of mud and rocks. It is 
hovel-shaped at times. Then, again, 
we found ovens built by American 
masons, with imported bricks and 
Portland cement. Grate bars were 
put in, and the proper flues arranged 
for eflFective baking. The possessors 
of ovens of this character have been 
able to bake beans successfully for 
the people as a side line to the bread 
and roll manufacture. 

The native baker calculates to keep 
the temperature of his ovens at about 
450®, but, as he does not use a ther- 
mometer, he seldom gets the right 
heat. He judges of the temperature 
for baking bread and beans by scat- 
tering flour on the floor of the oven. 
If the flotu' blackens within a cer- 
tain time without igniting, this is 
ample evidence that the fires are in 
proper trim for baking bread or beans. 

Beans are grown in considerable 
quantities in all the countries we 
visited. But the American resident 
seeks for the imported bean. The 
baked-bean manufacturers of the 
United States have discovered the 
call for the genuine article, and, there-

Baking Beans in the Orient

fore considerable stock has been shipped 
to distant lands. Cans of beans are 
placed on sale in the show windows 
of stores, and are peddled about the 
country by the merchants. The gro- 
cery stores handle much of the canned 
stuff, and it is not at all amiss to 
see the cans on exhibition on the 
counters and in the show windows of 
drug stores and fancyware stores. 

Much trickery is practised. I saw 
instances of refilled cans; that is, 
the genuine article had been disposed 
of, and the can with its original label 
used again after having been filled 
with domestic beans, baked by the 
untrained hands of the native baker. 
The native baker always gets the 
beans too sweet. He likes sweet diet 
himself, and takes it for granted that 
all the world is the same. Therefore, 
when it comes to sweetening the beans, 
he is liberal with the application of 
sugar. 

This reminds me of the sweet po- 
tatoes handled by the bakers in the 
Philippines. The native potato is of 
the sweet potato order, and rather 
small in size. The native bakers take 
these potatoes, and saturate them 
with sugar-cane liquid. In fact, the 
potato is permitted to stay in the 



279 

liquid for several days. The sweet 
stuff is absorbed, and the potato be- 
comes like a heavy chunk of candy. 
Then the baking is done, and what 
tastes like a stick of candy is sold 
to the native buyers, who relish this 
sort of thing. 

Another queer thing done by the 
native bakers of the Philippines is 
the preparation of the grasshopper. 
The natives delight in grasshopper 
food. Millions of the hoppers pass 
over the country at stated seasons. 

Narrow trenches are dug, and the 
hoppers fall in, and cannot hop out. 
The intense heat of the sun kills and 
dries them out in a few da>-s. Then 
the masses are gathered, and coatings 
of sugar applied. Then the native 
bakers take the mass in hand, and 



(AyMM Sign. 



bake it to a crisp, ' The sweet, brown, 
crispy stuff is very much liked by 
the natives. 

There is a native bean produced in 
the Philippines, about an inch long, 
which, when prepared like the real 
article, possesses some of the fasci- 
nating features of the famous Boston 
baked beans. But, as heretofore 
stated, imitations of all descriptions 
are, as a rule, avoided by foreigners 
in the Philippines, Japan, and China. 
The real bean is wanted, and hence 
the demand for the canned article 
shipped from the United States.

HAPPY NEW YEAR 

Hope springs eternal in the human breast ; 
Man never is, but always to be blest. 

HAPPINESS is the object for 
which all are seeking; and, not- 
withstanding the sad fact that 
"the poor always ye have with you," 
the number of happy people in the world 
is large indeed. Take this city, the 
metropolis of New England. There 
is much to interest, instruct, and en- 
tertain the masses who frequent her 
precincts. Art and science combine 
here to gratify the tastes of all, from 
humblest to highest class. 

Engrossed as we are with our own 
pursuits and pleasures, we often fail 
to realize that numerous people^f^in 
other parts of the land are just as happy 



as ourselves. In Cleveland, Detroit, 
St. Paul, Denver, and many another 
inland city, the conditions in each differ 
somewhat. The environments are not 
the same, but the people have no lack 
of means of enjo3rment, and are no 
less happy than their neighbors. So, 
too, in town and hamlet throughout 
the land, people enjoy life no less 
than do their brethren in the cities. 
In the country every man is inde- 
pendent, lord of his own domain. The 
well-arranged and prosperous cotmtry 
home comes as near to an earthly para- 
dise as one can hope to attain. 

Safe it is to say the amount of hap- 
piness in the world, compared with 
the suffering, all told, is far in excess. 
Happiness is the normal state of the 
race : suffering is abnormal. That the 
number of the happy people in the 
world may ever increase is the highest 
mission of all human effort. 

At this time of a New Year's con- 
gratulations a chief source of gratifica- 
tion consists in the contemplation of 
the goodly measure of prosperity and 
happiness that pervades otu* land. We 
also take especial pleasure in wishing 
the highest degree of happiness possible 
in 1907, to the readers of the Cooking- 
School Magazine, 



HEALTHFUL LIVING 

IN upbuilding and maintaining 
health and strength, we are learn- 
ing more and more to rely upon 
wholesome food and pure air. The 
old-time practitioner of medicine, or 
dispenser of drugs, is no longer in 
demand. We are"^ beginning to look 
upon sickness as out of order. Con- 
tagious diseases are almost entirely 
unnecessary; for, where cleanliness 
prevails, they are unknown. Even 
vaccination for immunity against small- 
pox is now tabooed, and regarded by 
not a few physicians as a criminal 
practice. He who would maintain 
a good, sturdy state of health must

simply eat wholesome food and take 
much exercise in the open air. 

As a class, school children are in 
special need of attention in regard to 
this matter of wholesome diet. How 
many puny boys and pale, slender girls 
are to be seen among the pupils of 
many a school! In too many cases 
the cause of this condition is ill-feeding 
and malnutrition. None too soon 
can children be taught that a first 
requisite to successful attainment is 
good health, also that proper nourish- 
ment and good health are intimately 
related as cause and effect. Many of 
us pass through the better part of life 
before we have learned to observe 
properly the conditions of right living 
or are aware of the importance of 
adequate nutrition. The primary laws 
of healthful living cannot be incul- 
cated at too early an age. This knowl- 
edge is of far greater consequence, in 
after-life, than a deal of mathematics 
or a smattering of a foreign language. 
Active, growing children, above all 
others, require good, wholesome, 
nourishing food, and enough of it. 

"There is no prophylactic so powerful 
as the happy, healthy resiliency of 
nature. Life is a fight against disease, 
and Nature has provided that life 
shall win if given about half a chance." 



LIVING COST GREATER 

FIGURES giving the average cost 
of living, compiled by R. G. Dun 
& Co., show that there has been 
a marked advance in prices as com- 
pared with November i, when it reached 
a high-water mark. 

In the lapse of one month the cost of 
living has advanced from $106.68 to 
$108.17, reached on December i. The 
cost of commodities is the highest since 
February, 1884. 

In discussing the subject of trade, 
authority says the rise in prices is 
"fairly representative of the greater 
demand that has followed increased 



prosperity throughout the nation and 
because of the advances in wages which 
has lifted the purchasing power of the 
people above all previous records in 
this and other nations." 



UNWISE TAXATION 



(( 




AST month," writes Food and 
Cookery y "we mentioned that 
'Germany, and more especially 
Prussia, was suffering greatly from the 
alarming rise in price of food staples, 
mainly as the result of a policy of 
ultra-protection. The same state of 
affairs is rapidly overtaking Austria, 
owing to the practical exclusion of 
meat imports from Servia and Rou- 
mania. Even before this, meat was 
top dear in Vienna and other large 
centres, where horse and dog flesh 
was largely consumed as a consequence. 
It is a terrible thing to raise artificial 
barriers against the international ex- 
change of foods, as it leads to bitter 
hardships for the laboring and middle 
classes, and adds enormously to the 
difficulties and risks of public caterers. 
Cheap food supply is the primary 
requirement for prosperity and happi- 
ness in a thickly populated industrial 
country. " 

The same state of affairs prevails 
in this country. It is futile to deny 
that high tariff is the main cause of 
the present high cost of living. No 
scarcity in food products exists any- 
where. There is no fear of war or 
other calamity. Only wide-spread and 
freer competition is needed to reduce 
the cost of the people's staples. 

Worst of all, no one can thoughtfully 
say that high tariff does not provide 
most fitting opportunity for combina- 
tions, trusts, and monopolies. Many * 
people are convinced that a protective 
tariff is the fostering "mother of trusts." 
Its history spells favoritism, — a tax on 
the many for the benefit of a few. At 
its best a protective, economic policy 
is selfish and cowardly. 



282 



The Boston Cooking^School Magazine 



Can an intelligent reason be given 
why our existing tariff rates should be 
higher than in the most trjdng times 
of our history? Why have we not 
long since, as we promised to do, faced 
in the opposite direction, — that is, low 
instead of high tariff? It may be said, 
we cannot have enough of a good 
thing. But this does not solve the 
problem that vexes and oppresses us, 
— the high cost of living. It is useless 
to assert that rise in wages keeps pace 
with the rise in the cost of commodi- 
ties. The schedules do not confirm it. 
Facts cannot be gainsaid. 

If we mistake not, the less people 
are taxed, the greater their content- 
ment. Wise and prudent economy 
leads to low rates of taxation. 



IN 1907 

WB wish the Cooking-School 
Magazine always to speak 
for itself. Our late numbers 
have received favorable mention and 
commendation from various sources. 
The present number, we think, holds 
good things, and is in no wise inferior 
in merit to any other. And we trust 
it will meet with the approval of our 
readers. Whatever degree of excel- 
lence the magazine has maintained in 
the past, we propose to make it better 
in the next year. 

Of contributed articles we are anxious 
to secure a larger number and on a 
greater variety of topics. Unavail- 
able manuscript is returned at request 
of the writer. We take this occasion 
to say that the sentiments expressed 
by our contributors may not be always 
in harmony with our own, but we are 
pleased to accept them as the thoughts 
of the author, and we claim to have 
reached that stage of intellectual ma- 
turity where we are avowedly tolerant 
of the opinions of others. 

For the more strictly culinary part 
of the magazine][the editor is entirely 
responsible. The entire contents of 



these pages are tried, proved, and pre- 
pared by her, and she is ready to vouch 
for accuracy in detail of every item 
of the same. This department is a 
marked feature of the magazine, and 
gives it an authority and standing 
which is secondary to that of no other 
household publication with which we 
are acquainted. Here the inquiries 
and wants of all subscribers receive 
the personal attention of the editor. 

The policy of the magazine is ever 
conservative, and yet we aim to be 
progressive and Xxy to adapt our 
pages to satisfy the every-day needs 
of the modem housekeeper. Would 
that we might be able to produce a 
publication of 'such rare excellence 
that it be deemed indispensable to the 
interests and welfare of every house- 
hold in the land I 



A KINDLY REMINDER 

THE price of the Cooking' 
School Magazine is one dollar 
a year to every subscriber, and 
it ought to be worth this sum many 
times over in every household. In 
utilizing food supplies, in labor-saving 
devices, in prudent marketing, in avoid- 
ing doctors charges, in improved health 
and consequent cheerfulness, — ^in each 
and all these lines of domestic economy, 
the home maker will find, from day to 
day, useful and helpful suggestions. 
In making up the annual list of reading 
matter for their home, we trust our 
readers will not fail to include the best 
of all culinary publications. We shall 
esteem your co-operation. 



There is no freedom on earth or in 
any star for those who deny freedom 
to others. — Elbert Hubbard.

" Grape-fruit 
Cut the grape-fruit in halves across 
the grain, to form two portions. With 
a thin, sharp- pointed knife — a pen- 
knife is the best — cut around the pulp 
in each little section of the fmit, so 
that each triangular section of pulp is 
freed from the surrounding membrane, 
and can be lifted out with an orange 
spoon or fork. Also cut the membrane, 
separating the sections and the core 
from the skin, and lift out all the mem- 
brane and core in one piece. Set the 
prepared half fruit in a grape-fruit 
bowl, contaitiing fine- chopped ice. 
Put a spoonful of sifted, powdered 
sugar in the centre the last moment 
before serving. Two tablespoonfuls of

sherry or one of Jamaica rum may be 
poured into the centre of the fruit be- 
fore the sugar is disposed upon it. 



Grape Fruit 

Consomme Rachel 
Consult a cook-book for the making 
and clearing of consomm^. When mak- 
ing the soup, let the fowl remain in the 
soup-kettle only long enough to be- 
come tender. Take off half of the 
breast to be used later in the soup, and 
use the rest of the fowl for some other 
dish. For eight guests allow two quarts 
of consomm^, generous measure, and 



ency to pour into the soup. Stir 
constantly, meanwhile. Then let cook 
ten minutes. Have ready the beaten 
yolks of three or four 
eggs diluted with a cup of 
cream. Stir these into the 
soup without allowing it 
to boil. Strain the soup; 
add the half-breast of 
chicken, cut in small 
cubes, and one cup of 
cooked peas. 

Hot Medallions of Hali- 
but, Editor's Style 
Have halibut steaks out 
a generous half-inch thick. 
Remove skin and bone 
from the steaks, to secure 
fillets or pieces containing 
nothing unedible. Press 
each fillet into a flat, round, or medallion 
shape, and use wooden toothpicks, 
dipped in melted butter, if necessary, to 
hold these in shape. Squeeze a little 
lemon juice over the prepared fish. 
Then pile the medallions one above 
another, with slices of onion between, 
and set aside until ready to cook. 
Cover the bones and trimmings with 
cold water. Add a few slices of carrot 
and half an onion, into which three or

the fire in boiling water to cover. Cover 
the dish, and let it stand where the water 
will not boil, yet remain hot for half an 
hour. Put the medallions of fish in an 
agate dish, a teaspoonful 
of butter on each. Pour 
around them about a cup 
of the fish stock, seasoned 
with salt and pepper. 
Set the dish in the oven, 
and let the fish cook very 
gently ten or fifteen 
minutes. For eight me- 
dallions, take one-fourth 
a cup of butter, and melt Hot 

it in a saucepan. Add 
one-fourth a cup of flour, a dash of 
paprika, and half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Stir and cook until frothy. Then add a 
cup of the fish stock, and cook until boil- 
ing. Add the broth in the pan in which 
the fish was cooked, and half a cup of 
white wine or cream (not both). Lay 
the medalUons on a serving-dish (remove 
toothpicks, if present), chop the whites 
of the cooked eggs, and stir into half of 
the sauce. Dispose this upon the me- 
dallions. Sift the yolks above, and pour 
the rest of the sauce around the fish. 

Potatoes en Casserole 
Cut French potato balls from pared, 
raw potatoes. Put 
one-fourth a cup of 
butter in an earthen 
casserole. Turn in 
three cups of the balls 
and a teaspoonful of 
salt. Shake the dish 
over the fire until the 
potatoes are evenly 
buttered and salted. 
Then pour in a cup 
and a half of boiling 
water or white broth. 
Cover the dish, and 
set it into the oven. 
Shake the dish occa- 
sionally or lift up the balls at the bot- 
tom of the dish, that all may be evenly 
cooked. They will require about forty- 



five minutes to cook in a moderate oven. 
Add a little stock or cream when nearly 
cooked, also additional seasoning, if 
needed. Serve from the casserole. 



Medallions of Halibut, Editor's Style 

There should not be a superfluity of 
liquid in the dish, just enough to 
serve a scant tablespoonful with each 
service of potato. 

Cucumbers, French Dressing ~ 
Pare the cucumbers, and let them 
stand in ice water, to become chilled 
and crisp. When ready to serve, rub 
the inside of the serving-dish with a 
clove of garlic, cut in halves, and in tliis 
dispose the cucumbers, carefully dried 
and cut in thin, even slices. Prepare a 
French dressing in the proportion of 
three tablespoonfuls of oil, one table- 
spoonful of vinegar, one-fourth a tea- 



spoonful, each, of salt and paprika, and 
from six to ten drops of onion juice. 
Pour this over the cucumbers. After

the rib bone clean, thus forming French 
chops. Cut through the back of each

the oranges are very add), one cup 
of pineapple juice (grated pineapple 
cooked in equal measure of water and 
strained), and three-fourths a cup of 
sugar. Stir until the sugar is melted, 
then strain into the can of a freezer. 
Add half a cup of rum or half a cup of 
water, and freeze slightly. In freezing, 
use but little salt, or the mixture on 
standing, especially if rum be not used, 
will be too solid. It should be slightly 
frozen, and is to be drunk through the 
straws. 

English Muffins 

Soften a yeast cake in half a cup of 
lukewarm water. Add this to a cup 
of scalded-and-cooled milk, into which 
two tablespoonf uls of butter has been 
melted. Add also half a teaspoonful 
of salt and one cup and a half of sifted 
bread flour. Beat the above mixture 
until it is very smooth. Then cover, 
and set to rise. When the sponge is 
light, beat into it about two cups, or 
two and one-fourth cups, of flom-, con- 
tinuing the beating some few minutes 
(eight or ten), to make a tough batter. 
Cover, and let stand until again light. 
The mixttue is now ready to use, or it 
may be cut down, covered, and set into 
the refrigerator until morning. When 
ready to bake, cut the dough into 
twenty-fotu pieces. Knead these with 
floured hands or on a well-flotued board 
(the dough is rather soft). Then pat 
them to the size of the rings. Have the 
board well floured, and the muffin rings 
well buttered. Put the rings on the 
board and the dough in the rings, and 
cover close with a pan or cloth. 
When the dough a little more than half 
fills the rings, remove the ring and 
dough with a spatula to a well heated 
and buttered griddle. Keep the griddle 
of uniform heat, and", when the muffins 
are baked on one side, ttun mufiin and 
ring, and bake the other side. When 
baked, cut through the crust. Then 
tear the muffin apart with the fingers 
(as a cracker is split), and toast the 



halves over a bed of coals. Spread the 
rough side with butter as soon as 
toasted, and serve at once. The muf- 
fin rings used for this recipe were two 
and three-fourths inches in diameter. 
Rings of a larger size may be used. 

Cream Cheese Pyramids 

Chop fine eight or ten large pimolas. 
Add one (five-cent) cream cheese (Neuf- 
chAtel), one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt, and half a teaspoonful of paprika. 
Rub and mix these ingredients to- 
gether thoroughly. Then divide the 
mixture into six •r eight equal portions, 
and roll these, one by one, with a silver 
spoon in the chopping-bowl into balls. 
Then by pressure with the spoon roll 
one end to a point, flatten both ends and 
finish with a bit of parsley. Serve with 
English muffins split, toasted, and spread 
vdth butter. The muffins should be hot. 

Spanish Pudding 

Set three cups of milk to scald over 
hot water. Put one ounce of granu- 
lated gelatine to soak in half a cup of 
cold water. Beat the yolks of four 
eggs, and gradually beat in three- 
fourths a cup of sugar and half a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Dilute the egg and 
sugar with a little of the hot milk. 
Then return the whole to the double 
boiler, stir and cook until the mixture 
thickens. Remove from the fire. Add 
the softened gelatine, and set to cool in 
cold water. Beat the whites of four 
eggs dry. Add them with three table- 
spoonfuls of sherry wine and one tea- 
spoonful of vanilla extract to the cus- 
tard mixture, and, as the mixture cools 
and thickens, fold the beaten whites 
into it. Turn into a mould, and set 
aside to become firm. Beat one cup of 
double cream, half a teaspoonful of 
vanilla, and three tablespoonfuls of 
sugar until thick to the bottom of the 
dish. Pipe this onto the pudding, 
turned from the mould. Finish with a 
few candied or maraschino cherries, cut 
in halves.

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 



Friendship multiplies joys and divides griefs.

Portugutst Proverb. 

IN our illustrated pages we pre- 
sent two menus for formal lunch- 
cons; but even for formal affairs, 
where eight or ten guests are to be 
entertained, these menus may be cut 
by the shrewd economist. It is usu- 
ally thought a more simple thing to 
prune a menu than to add to it. The 
length of a menu and the number of 
courses in which it is presented should 
depend entirely upon the number of 
assistants in the dining-room. A 
woman who is both hostess and cook, 
in entertaining six guests, will not 
prolong a meal at which an abundance 
of food has been already supplied, 
by serving an entr^ as a course by 
itself or by changing the plates for 
both a sweet course and a course of 
toasted crackers with cheese. It is 
quite another matter when the meal 
is served by maids who are paid to 
do this particular service; but even 
then there is such a thing as weary- 
ing our friends by tedious service. 

There are times when a luncheon 
party is the one thing needful to pay 
off our arrearages in a social way; 
but for genuine pleasure the little 
luncheon — for which we have given 
elsewhere a page of menus — will be 
found quite "the thing." It is not 



i.—SaHck Provtrb. 

and what is his own by himself.— 



intended that these latter menus 
should represent a week's planning 
and work, but that they should fill 
the needs of the "four-fifths," who 
on Sunday or Monday may suddenly 
say, "The g^ls must come and take 
luncheon with me on Wednesday." 
To be able to carry out such thoughts, 
now and then, without overwork or 
worry is one of the main things that 
makes housekeeping a pleasure. 

In a way the entertaining of one's 
friends — as also the serving of the 
home or every-day meals — is simpli- 
fied greatly, when one has a dining- 
room that is used for no other piupose 
save that of serving meals. Fifteen 
minutes' work each morning will keep 
such a room in good order; and, if 
an extra half-hour is needed for some 
special effort, the enthusiasm called 
out by the prospect of an opportu- 
nity to compare notes with friends 
will carry one through this without 
a thought of monotony. 

In the small households of the four- 
fifths who ' 'do their own work ' ' 
something more than the usual luncb- 
eon must be provided, if two or three 
friends are to be given place at the 
table; but, after all, in general, if 
a tray of yeast rolls or a relish be 



After Breakfiist Chat

Added to the daily menu, or, a choicer 
dessert be substituted for that al- 
ready planned, the matter may be 
decided at once. 

The making of a pan of yeast rolls 
or biscuit may seem to many a great 
tmdertaking; and yet these may be 
made the day before and reheated, 
or started in the afternoon, and, 
when about ready to bake, kept in 
the refrigerator over night. The time 
required for actual work is short, and 
the labor light. It seems a great 
undertaking only because we do not 
make them often enough. Many 
would "make things" more often if 
everything needed were at hand. In 
truth, our tables would be supplied 
with a great variety of food if re- 
ceptacles holding sifted flour of vari- 
ous kinds, well dried out and ready 
for instant use, were in close proxim- 
ity to mixing-bowls, egg-beaters, bak- 
ing-tins, measuring-cups, sugar, but- 
ter, eggs, baking-powder, and other 
commodities. 

Make the doing of work as easy as 
possible by having every utensil or 
food product as near as possible to 
the place where it is to be handled. 
Then do things often, and you will 
have no consciousness of the motions 
you go through to secure the result. 
When dancing the two-step or the 
waltz, who save the beginner or the 
teacher analyzes the result to find 
out the postures or positions that 
go to produce it ? 

We say of certain housekeepers 
among our acquaintances, **They have 
a 'faculty' of turning ofif work." 
Possibly this faculty is nothing but 
the exponent of an unusually active 
and attentive mind. 

In reading the newspaper aloud, 
there are those whose whole attention 
is fixed on the words they are speak- 
ing. Others, while they are giving 
to the spoken words the inflection 
needed to convey the proper meaning 
of the author, have their eyes at the 



other end of the line or even at the 
end of the paragraph, and know what 
is coming next. Thus, in laying the 
table and cooking a meal, the woman 
with ** faculty" carries in her mind 
many things at one and the same 
time. She is never in danger of for- 
getting any one item or of not know- 
ing the exact condition of all at a 
given moment. Such a woman can 
prepare a meal of three or four courses, 
properly selected and made ready 
to cook beforehand, in the time that 
another would give to the cooking 
of a single dish. She would also 
finish with no more fatigue than if 
she had stood and watched over the 
one dish, knife and fork or skimmer 
in hand, during every moment of the 
cooking. 

The * 'faculty" of preparing a dinner, 
served in courses to six or eight guests, 
does not mean heavy or, necessarily, 
rapid work, for, in the main, each 
course is cooked by itself; but when 
a woman is both cook and hostess, 
though the food be made ready, 
largely, beforehand, but little cooking 
should be done while the guests are 
seated at table; and meals of several 
courses iare not desirable. Still there 
are many dishes that lend themselves 
most happily tcrthis mode of serving, as 
do all dishes prepared en casserole and 
the many viands cooked in the chafing- 
dish, and kept hot over boiling water; 
and a luncheon in three courses ought 
to be within the compass, occasion- 
ally at least, of the woman who does 
her own work. Of these the first 
course should be fruit, appetizer, soup 
or fish, whichever one you may elect. 
The second should be served by the 
hostess, assisted by some one at the 
opposite end of the table, and should 
include everything to be eaten before 
the dessert and coffee, or the cheese, 
wafer and coffee, if that be prefer- 
able to a sweet course. It should 
be needless to add that the various 
dishes in this course should all be

tributary to the main dish; i.e., be- 
long to it and to each other. There 
should be no discordant note in the 
combination. 



A Word concerning Table Ware 

There are always new conceits in 
table ware. One of the newest is the 
grape-fruit bowl, a china bowl on a 
standard most graceful and artistic 
in design. The grape-fruit bowl is 
fashioned to hold chipped ice and 
half a grape-fruit. The ornamenta- 
tion of the bowl shown in our illus- 
tration on another page does not 
present the delicate traceries usually 
seen on French china, but a clear, 
bold pattern, — ^bright red cherries 
with green leaves true to life both 
in style and coloring. The effect of 
this and similar patterns on a table 
glistening with silver and cut glass 
is particularly good on a chill winter's 
day. 

The broad, low, two-handled cup 
shown in the illustration of the "cream- 
of -pearl . barley soup" can scarcely 
be called new, for these were brought 
out five or six years ago. Still, they 
have been seen rarely outside of a 



few large cities, and are worthy of 
a wider reputation. When set in 
silver filigree frames, similar to those 
made for bouillon cups, the cream- 
soup cup reaches the acme of elegance. 

The common soup plate, in finer 
wares, has changed in shape some- 
what. The newer importations show 
smaller plates of greater depth. This 
innovation is a good one. The filled 
plate is more easily handled, and the 
soup retains its heat longer. 

Now that punch-bowls are called 
into requisition on so many occasions, 
and a change of style is occasionally 
desirable, one might some time try 
the device spoken of in a foreign jour- 
nal. The outside of the bowl to within 
an inch of the top is brushed over 
with white of egg, slightly beaten. 
Into this sifted powdered sugar is 
dredged and allowed to dry. Thus a 
bowl with a frosted exterior is secured. 

The china in our illustrations is shown 
through the courtesy of Messrs. Jones, 
McDuffee & Stratton, of Boston.

give tedpes and illustrations of mid-winter 
dishes. We shall also speak of some of the 
most common and unhygienic errors in eat- 
ing.— -Ed. 



Schools of Cookery in France 



Nothing could be more gratifying 
than to record the great progress which 
schools of cookery in France continue 
to make. Their success in any case 
was assured from the first. The best 
proof that their absolute utility is rec- 
ognized by one and all is to be found 
in the fact that both mistresses and 
maids no longer hesitate to take ad- 
vantage enthusiastically of the oppor- 
tunities offered for study, and it is 
never too late to learn. The subjects 
taught at such schools are plain and 



advanced cookery, invalid cookery, 
the use of the chafing-dish, and wait- 
ress duties. As will be seen from such 
practical notions, a great deal can be 
learned by ladies — ^irrespective of rank, 
and the French are not proud in such 
matters — at such conferences or lessons, 
which are all to the point. It is need- 
less to add that the greatest benefits 
are to be derived particularly from the 
special lessons given in fancy cookery 
for entertaining, as well as of many 
foods for the home table. 



The Reheating of Food 

By Marion Harris Neil 



THE reheating of food nicely 
is an art in itself. What is 
called a richauffS, if carefully 
treated and tastefully dished up, may 
be at once a luxury and a thing of 
beauty. On the other hand, one can- 
not be siuprised at the prejudice against 
**restUTection dishes," when one sees 
the ignorance or indiflFerence which even 
good cooks display when the reheating 
of partly used food comes into ques- 
tion. Properly speaking, food should 
not be cooked twice at all, but slowly 
reheated in such a manner that it is 
not deprived of its nourishment or 
flavor. Steam is one of the best me- 
diums we can employ, but many things 
must be reheated in the oven; and, 
if such dishes are to be a success, it is 
absolutely necessary for the cook to 
have a knowledge of sauces. 

Stews, salmis, and fricassees are all 
things that have been cooked in a sauce, 
and these all lend themselves admirably 
to reheating. This is one reason why 
these things are economical, and, if 
the rule of never allowing the sauce 
to actually boil is strictly observed, 
then a spoiled or unpalatable dish is 
next to impossible. Perhaps cold fish 
gets the worst treatment of any, so 
one or two recipes for tasty dishes may 
not come amiss. 

Fish and Macaroni Pie 

This makes an excellent breakfast 
dish, and any kind of fish may be used 
for it. Remove all the skin and bone 
from half a pound of cold, cooked fish, 
and break it into large flakes. Break 
a quarter of a pound of macaroni into 
pieces about half an inch long, throw 
it into a pan of fast boiling water, add 
one tablespoonful of butter, and cook 
till tender. Butter a pudding-dish, 
put in a layer of fish, then some pieces 
of butter, sprinkle over two teaspoon- 



fuls of grated cheese and a little salt 
and pepper. Now put in a layer of 
macaroni, then some butter, cheese, 
and so on till the dish is full. Sprinkle 
a thick layer of grated cheese oil the 
top. Put some pieces of butter here 
and there on it, and bake in a hot oven 
till it is a nice brown color. Serve very 
hot. 

Curry of Fish 

Melt two ounces of good dripping 
or butter in a pan, stir in two ounces 
of flour smoothly, keep stirring over the 
fire for a few minutes, then add one 
dessert-spoonful of ciury powder, and 
one dessert-spoonful of chutney. Next 
add one pint of milk, and mix the sauce 
over the fire until it boils and thickens. 
Add three hard-boiled eggs, cut in 
slices, and half a pound of cooked fish, 
broken into flakes. Mix all well to- 
gether. Pile it up on a hot dish, and 
garnish with croutons of bread. Serve 
with plain boiled rice. 

Fish Pudding 

Free the remnants of any cold fish 
from skin and bone, and chop it fine. 
Put the bones and the unusable scraps 
of the fish into a small pan, just cover 
with water, and boil up for five min- 
utes, then drain. This is what is called 
fish stock. Put one ounce of butter 
and one ounce of flour into a pan, and 
stir over the fire until the butter has 
absorbed the flour. Now add one gill 
of milk and half a gill of the fish stock, 
and stir till boiling. You should have 
a nice thick sauce. Now drop in two 
yolks of eggs, and stir over the fire for 
one minute longer. Remove the pan 
from the fire, and add a cup of the 
chopped fish. Season very well with 
salt, pepper, and cayenne, and, if fresh 
fish is used, one teaspoonful of anchovy 
sauce is a great improvement. Last of

all, beat the whites of eggs to a stiff 
froth, and mix in lightly. If the eggs 
are not good large ones, a tablespoonf ul 
of fine bread crumbs may be necessary. 
This pudding may be steamed for one 
hour, and served with white sauce. 
It is very good indeed baked as fol- 
lows: Butter a small mould which holds 
one pint. Sprinkle fine brown bread 
crumbs over the butter till the mould is 
coated completely. Pour in the fish 
mixture, and bake in a hot oven for half 
an hour. This is an excellent breakfast 
dish, and makes a fine change. 

Mutton is excellent reheated in a 
good curry sauce. Cut the mutton from 
the bones rather early in the day, and 
put the bones on covered with water to 
make stock. Boil gently for two hours, 
strain, and with a piece of white paper 
take off all the fat. Cut the mutton into 
pieces about an inch square, and re- 
move all fat. Say you have half a 
pound or three-quarters of a poimd of 
these pieces. Chop an onion and a 
small green apple. Melt one otmce of 
butter in a pan, and fry the chopped 
onion in it till yellow. Add one 
tablespoonful of flour, two teaspoonfuls 
of curry powder, and a teaspoonf ul of 
salt. Mix well, and add three gills of 
the stock. Cook slowly for half an hour, 
stirring now and then, as it is apt to 
bum. Draw the pan to a part of the 
stove where it will keep hot without 
boiling, and put in the mutton. Put on 
the lid, and let it lie for an hour, if pos- 
sible, so that the flavor of the sauce may 
permeate the meat. Serve with dry, 
boiled rice. The sauce generally re- 
quires to be thickened a little before 
serving. Smooth a teaspoonf ul of corn- 
starch in a spoonful of milk or cream, 
and add at the last. A squeeze of lemon 
juice is also a great improvement. 

For reheating slices of roast beef, 
make a sauce exactly in the same way, 
omitting the curry and the apple and 
substituting two peeled tomatoes. A 



dish of this kind should be garnished 
with fried or toasted bread. Again, if 
you have your oven going, — and a very 
moderate oven will do for this, you can 
try: 

Cold Meat Pie 

Make a sauce exactly as described 
last, with the tomatoes. Boil and mash 
six or eight potatoes. Make them very 
smooth with a little milk and a tea- 
spooonful of butter. Add salt and pep- 
per. Now put the sauce in a pudding- 
dish, and lay in the slices of meat. Cover 
all with the mashed potatoes, mark the 
top neatly, and brush with egg. If the 
expense is not objected to, an egg, or 
part of it, can be beaten into the 
potatoes. It is a decided improvement, 
and, of course, adds to the nourish- 
ment of the dish. Make quite hot in 
the oven without letting the sauce 
boil, and brown the top in front of the 
fire or under a gas grill. 

Miroton of Beef 

What is called miroton of beef will 
be much liked by people who like onions. 
Chop three good-sized onions fine, 
fry them in two ounces of hot butter 
or dripping. They must be quite 
cooked, and constantly turned to pre- 
vent burning. Pour on the onions half 
a pint of brown gravy. You may 
make this with the bones of the beef, 
and get all the browning from the bot- 
tom of the roasting-pan, or a little 
kitchen bouquet may be added. Lay 
in the slices of roast beef, cover the pan 
with a lid, and heat through. Of 
cotu-se, it must be seasoned nicely. 

Potato Paste 

Meat in potato paste is good. Chop 
up some meat cold. Season with 
ketchup, salt, and pepper. Mash six 
or eight potatoes with a little butter 
and beaten egg, and knead in as much 
flour as it will take without cracking. 
Roll out an oblong shape, lay on the 
meat, wet the edges, and fold up like

a large roll. Brush with egg, and bake 
in a hot oven till a light brown color. 

Here is a most delicious concoction 
of cooked chicken or partridge. Ham 
may be the chief ingredient, with rab- 
bit or veal added according to the 
scraps there are to use up. 

SufFolk Pie 

Chop fine three-quarters of a pound 
of cooked ham and four ounces of 
cooked chicken. Mix with them two 
teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley and 
one teaspoonful of chopped mixed herbs. 
Season the mixture with pepper^ and 
with salt, if necessary. Butter a 
pudding-dish, line the bottom of it with 
a slice of bread, trimming off the crusts. 
Pour over enough brown stock or gravy 
to thoroughly moisten it. Next put in 
a layer of the mixture, and so on till 
the dish is full, letting the last layer 
be of bread. Pour some stock over each 
layer of bread, or it will be too dry. 
Put the dish in a slow oven for about 
three-quarters of an hour, then turn 



it out carefully onto a flat dish. Bake 
in a hot oven till brown. It may be 
served either hot or cold. 

Curried Rice 

If there is cold boiled rice on hand, 
it may be converted into a most ap- 
petizing dish. The following is a genu- 
ine Indian recipe. Chop two shallots, 
fry them a golden brown color in two 
ounces of hot butter. Add one tea- 
spoonful of curry paste and two 
teaspoonfuls of curry powder, and fry 
them for a few minutes. Now add 
six ounces of boiled rice, half a pint 
of brown sauce, two teaspoonfuls of 
sweet chutney, two teaspoonfuls of 
tarragon vinegar, and one peeled 
tomato, cut in small pieces. Stir gently, 
and make it thoroughly hot. If nec- 
essary, add more sauce, and season it 
carefully. Dish it high, with two hard- 
boiled eggs cut in slices round the base. 
Wash and pick over a bunch of water- 
cress, sprinkle it .with a few drops of 
oil and vinegar, and put a border of it 
round outside the border of egg. 



A Light Portfolio 



If any sick or aged person in the 
household complains that a portfolio 
or lapboard is too heavy for her when 
she wishes to write letters or try to 
do any drawing for amusement, this 
idea is suggested. 

Take a large sheet of corrugated 
paper, and use it for a lapboard or 
portfolio. For the latter it must be 
folded. The quality that is used for 
sending large photographs and draw- 
ings flat, by mail or express, must be 
chosen. To enhance its appearance, 
it could be covered with any pretty, 
figured, upholstery cretonne, linen, or 



chiffon broadcloth. Make elastic straps 
for holding the paper, a few envelopes, 
and stamps in place. 

To a well person these things are 
incomprehensible; but, when a person 
has once been weak, she knows the 
value of trifling comforts, and such a 
thing is a great relief. Many persons 
can write letters without discomfort 
and weariness if there is not the strain 
of sitting at a desk or holding much 
weight in the lap, just as they can en- 
joy a rose, but could not possibly work 
over a rose garden.

A Helpful Husband 

SUNDAY evening is the happiest 
of the week for the man-of-the 
house. It is then that he gets the 
supper. The ceremonies begin at five 
o'clock, when we go out to the kitchen, 
and I bring forth from the pantry our 
whole collection of broilers, and lay 
them on the table for inspection. The 
man selects two, one of which he 
hopes may prove adequate to the 
cooking of four modest chops; and 
I return the rejected items to the 
closet. Then I set out upon the 
kitchen table the coffee, the coffee- 
pot, a spoon with which to measure 
the coffee, a fork to handle the chops, 
and a plate on which these Utensils 
rest when not in active service. The 
platter, the salt and pepper, and a 
measuring-cup for the boiling water, 
which is to be poured over the coffee, 
being put ready to his hand, I betake 
myself to the dining-room, and set 
the table. Just as I finish, a shout of 
' 'Where's the egg ? " summons me 
to the kitchen. I extract an egg 
from the refrigerator, break, and add 
it to the collection of bric-i-brac 
upon tlie table, I spread and cut 
half a loaf of bread into "thin bread 
and butter," arrange the salad, make 
the French dressing, heat the milk 
for the coffee, and get the dessert 
ready to serve, while the man, his 
hands carefully protected by furnace 
gloves, and an expression of desperate 
resolve upon his brow, gallops madly 
from table to stove. 

About half-past six we sit down 



to the most delicious coffee and the 
most perfectly broiled chops ever 
tasted. When it is all over, and I 
am washing the dishes and tidying 
the kitchen, and the man-of-the -house 
is smoking a peaceful pipe, he suddenly 
breaks out: "I wish you'd let Nora 
have an evening out during the week. 
I'd get dinner just as I did to-night. 
I'd love to, and it wouldn't be a bit 
of trouble to you." 

There is a moral to this little tale. 
It is that a man cooks better than a 
woman, as a rule, and for three rea- 
sons: first, he cooks what he wants, 
because he wants to; second, he has 
about him everything he needs to 
cook with; and, third, he gives his 
undivided attention to what be is 
doing, and does it with all his might. 
It is better to have two perfect dishes 
than a dozen indifferently prepared. 



Boric Acid 

HOW many housekeepers, I won- 
der, appreciate or even know the 
value of boric (or boracic) acid? Yet 
there is nothing better for so many 
purposes. It is harmless and non- 
poisonous, and, therefore, does not 
require attention to keep it out oE 
reach, I,et me tell our friends a few 
of the uses it may be put to. First 
buy one-fourth a pound at the druf 
store, and have it put in a box. Put 
two ounces of this in a quart preser\e 
jar, boil clean water, and fill the jar. 
Stir once or twice; and,^as soon as 



Home Ideas and Economies 



301 



the acid is dissolved, it is ready for 
use. If you bum yourself, as we often 
do, saturate a piece of cheese-cloth, 
old linen, or absorbent cotton (all 
of which should be constantly on 
hand), and place the wet cloth on the 
bum, and wrap gently. Should you 
be tmfortunate enough to bum two 
or three fingers, wrap each one sep- 
arately, so they will not adhere to- 
gether while healing. Promptness in 
excluding the air from a bum (or 
cut) will'save much suffering. When 
children skin a knee or get any sort 
of a bruise, resort quickly to your 
boric-acid solution. It may be ap- 
plied cold, or, if it is unpleasant to 
feel a cold application, heat a Uttle 
and use it hot. If you have a sore 
finger, such as a **run-a-round" felon, 
heat a little of the solution, and hold the 
finger in it as hot as can be borne. Re- 
peat several times a day, and tie the 
finger up in a piece of wet gauze, with 
oiled silk on the outside, for it is a 
wonderful healing agent. 

Boric acid is a most effective dis- 
infectant, especially as there is no 
odor whatever about it. Use it wher- 
ever possible, to wash shelves in the 
pantry, storeroom, or the dresser. 
Use it to wash out the bath-tub, 
the stationary wash-stand, and toilet 
closet. The cheapest way to buy it 
is, of course, in large quantities. Like 
everything else, the larger the quan- 
tity, the lower the price. i^. N.

Crazy Pudding 

ONE quart of plain lemon jelly 
should be chopped fine in a chop- 
ping-bowl. To this should be added 
one cup of walnut or pecan meats 
and one-half cup (or more) of candied 
cherries, all in tiny pieces. Rem- 
nants of canned fruits, such as peaches 
and pineapple, cut rather fine, are a 
good addition. One cup of dried mac- 
aroon drops, or ten or twelve larger 
macaroons, should be rolled and mixed 



with the jelly, nuts, and fmit. With 
a spoon stir until the different in- 
gredients are evenly distributed. Pile 
the mixture in a handsome glass dish, 
and serve with whipped or plain 
cream. The tiny pieces of jelly give 
a sparkling appearance, and the 
chopped fruits add effective touches 
of color. It is an excellent way of util- 
izing jelly which has stiffened too much 
to be appetizing in moulded form.

Small Press Boards 

IF in need of a tiny, light ironing- 
board, obtain at a dry-goods store 
one of the smooth white boards used 
as a foundation for great rolls of fine 
dress goods. No charge will be made 
for it; and, when it arrives with your 
purchases, have ready something to 
pad it rather soft, such as a strip from 
a comforter, or almost anything white, 
provided it is smooth. White is best, 
because anything colored may stain 
through the outer cover, when seams 
are dampened for pressing. The outer 
cover should be any good piece of 
white cotton goods. If used for col- 
ored dress goods only, then gray or 
black cloth is better than white for 
the covering, since no white nap will 
rub off on to the dark work. 

Many persons will carelessly press 
a dark dress upon a white-covered 
ironing-board, if only it looks clean, 
forgetting that starched clothes pre- 
viously ironed upon it will have left 
traces of starch upon the cover, which 
will make the woollen goods of the 
new garment look shiny. 

It is well to have an individual press- 
board for ribbons, fancy work, and 
small bits of work. j. d. c.

Genuine New England Cream Tart 

Pie 

SELECT firm, Spitzenberg apples, 
and make as dry an apple sauce 
as possible, sweetened slightly and 
strained. For a large-size pie use one 
pint of apple, one pint of double cream, 
yolks of three eggs, beaten stiff, and 
one-half of a nutmeg. An under crust 
only is used, and this may be baked 



the day before. Fill and bake about 
one half-hotu-. Use the whites of 
three eggs for the meringue, and 
brown in the oven. 

This pie is perfection, and was used 
by our New England fathers (and 
mothers) at Thanksgiving and Christ- 
mas time especially. 

Use Spitzenberg apples, as the true 
tart flavor will be lost if made with 
any other apple.

Things Worth Passing On 

HELIOTROPE sachet powder which 
had lost its freshness was found 
to make an excellent deodorizer. A 
tiny coal dropped into a tablespoon- 
ful in a cup sent up a dainty wreath 
of fragrant incense, continuing to bum 
steadily for some time with happy 
results. 

Add to your canned currants an 
equal quantity of canned blueberries. 
The acid of the currants tones up the 
flatness of the blueberries, while the 
latter modifies the stringency of the 
former, making a sauce of highly agree- 
able flavor and wholesome properties.

Cut potatoes in cubes, and cook in 
the stock until tender. Cut cheese in 
cubes, also bread crusts. Put the

one tablespoonful of vinegar to three

NOW is the season of good things 
to eat in all our fine stores. To 
empty the purse to fill the stomach 
need not be necessary for nutriment; 
but, when aestheticism steps in, then, 
alas I it costs somewhat more. Not 
too high a price is asked when one 
considers the care with which choice 
things are grown and preserved and 
brought here from other countries. 
Surely, the hog and hominy venders 
must make as much money with their 
wares as those who sell the novelties. 
And what a pleasure it is to find just 
the daintiest and best-flavored thing, 
at short notice, to send as a present, 
or with which to regale our guests I 

Two novelties were observed recently 
in one of our best stores. A group of 
tall white glass bottles held Chinois 
au Maresquin, which means little 
Chinese oranges, about as big as grapes, 
put up in maraschino cordial. It is 
best to say cordial rather than liqueur, 
for there is such a difference between 
liquor which brings to mind the 



drunkard's beverage and a choice 
French cordial, or liqueur used wisely 
by epiciu-es. To return, these tiny 
oranges are the Chinese cumquat, or 
cumquot, — though really, when the 
Chinese speak the name, it sounds more 
like gumgut. In Japan they are known 
as kin-kan. Crystalized, they are de- 
licious for tiny dishes for dessert. 

The second novelty was of mush- 
rooms in tiny bottles. These cham- 
pignons were cut with a fancy cutter, 
such as are used for Julienne soup 
vegetables, only very small indeed, of 
the shape of a Maltese cross with blunt 
curved ends. They are simply bottled, 
and not spiced or salted, and are in- 
tended for any dainty dish in which 
it is desired to introduce mushrooms. 
Think of it I How nice for the top of 
a salad! And for a delicate cream 
sauce for breast of chicken! But 
would it not be well really to give the 
mushroom flavor with cheaper whole 
ones, and depend on these for more of 
an effective finish to please the eye ?

Caramel Junket 

Cook three-fourths a cup of sugar 
to caramel. Add hot water and let 
cook, stirring after a time, until a 
thick syrup is formed. Let cool a 
little. Then turn into one quart of 
rich milk and one cup of cream. Add 
also one-fourth a cup of sugar and, 
if not already at blood heat, set the 
dish containing the mixture into a pan 
of hot water for a few minutes. When 
at the temperature of about 90*^ Fahr., 
stir in a junket tablet, crushed and 
dissolved in a tablespoonful of milk or 
water. Then turn into sherbet glasses. 
Let the glasses stand in a warm place 
until the mixture jellies. Then chill 
before serving. For a more elaborate 
dish, just before serving, decorate 
each cup with whipped cream, flavored 
with vanilla and sweetened before 
whipping.

QuBRY 1 194. — Mrs. P. J. W., Nashville, 
Tenn.: "Recipe for Graham pudding and 
golden sauce. How can the under crust of 
fruit pies be kept from being soggy?" 

Graham Pudding 

See "a simple steamed pudding" 
given in answer to query 1191. Omit 
the spices, if desired, and substitute 
Graham flour for the entire wheat and 
white flour given in the recipe. 

Golden Sauce 

Beat one-fourth a cup of butter to 
a cream. Add gradually one cup of 
brown sugar and the beaten yolks of 
two eggs, then stir and gradually add 
half a cup of scalded milk. Cook over 
hot water until the mixttue thickens, 
then fold in the whites of two eggs, 
beaten stiff. Flavor with wine, vanilla, 
or grated nutmeg. 

To prevent Soggy Pie Crust 

The best way to prevent a soggy 
under crust to pies is to set the pies to 
bake in a moderately heated oven, not 
a hot oven nor yet a cold one. The 
under crust should begin to bake before 
the Uquid in the pie begins to boil over. 
Put the lower crust loosely over the 
pie plate, and let it extend beyond the 
plate about one-fourth an inch. Do not 
stretch the upper crust after it is laid 
over the fruit. Roll it out large enough 
to cover the fruit loosely, brush the 
flat edge of the under crust with cold 



water before laying the upper crust 
upon it, and brush both edges after- 
wards. 



QuBRY 1 195.— J. E. B., noilo, Philippine 
Islands: "What are the best methods of pre- 
paring and cooking evaporated, dried, or 
compressed vegetables? Also dried peas, len- 
tils, etc." 

Cooking Dried or Compressed 
Vegetables 

We have had but little experience 
in cooking dried or compressed vege- 
tables, and cannot speak authoritatively 
on the matter. Probably the best 
mode of procedure would be as follows: 
Soak over night in cold water, set to 
cook in the same water, and cook rapidly 
until tender. Then season, and dress 
in any of the ways suitable for the 
fresh vegetable. 

Cooking Dried Peas and Lentils 

Soak both peas and lentils over 
night in cold water, drain, wash, and 
rub lentils between the h^ids in fresh 
water, then finish the cooking after 
some special recipe. . 

Peas Baked as Boston Baked Beans

down into the centre of the peas. Put 
a teaspoonful of mustard, two teaspoon- 
fuls of salt, and one-fourth a cup of 
molasses into a cup. Pour in boiling 
water, mix thoroughly, and pour the 
whole over the peas. Then aidd more 
water to cover the peas. Cover closely, 
and let bake in a moderate oven about 
eight hours. Add water as needed to 
keep the peas moist, but do not add 
water during the last half -hour of cook- 
ing. Lentils may be cooked in the 
same way, but strained tomato (cooked) 
should form part of the liquid in which 
they are baked. Olive oil or butter, 
one-third a cup, or pork sausage may 
replace the salt pork with either vege- 
table. Cold, baked peas or lentils, with 
or without green vegetables, may be 
dressed as a salad. Pressed through 
a fine sieve, after boiling, they may be 
seasoned with salt, pepper, and plenty 
of butter, and served as a pur^e, or 
diluted with water, stock, or milk as 
a soup. An onion may be cooked in 
the baking-dish with the vegetables, 
and removed before serving. Lima 
beans which were not referred to by 
our correspondent are worthy of at- 
tention. Mixed with dried com after 
stewing and well seasoned, they give 
a most appetizing dish. 



QuBRY 1 1 96. — Mrs. W., Montreal, Canada: 
"Recipe for pressed meat that will slice 
nicely when cold." 

Pressed Corned Beef 

Put a piece of corned beef, rinsed in 
cold water, over the fire in cold water 
to cover, and bring slowly to the boiling- 
point. I^t boil five minutes, then re- 
move to a cooler part of the range, and 
let simmer from four to six hours or 
until very tender. Reniove from the 
kettle to an oblong pan (or a press de- 
signed for the purpose may be used), 
cover with a board bearing a weight. 
Let stand some hours or over night, 
when it is ready to cut in thin slices. 
A piece of the brisket is a choice piece 



to buy for this piupose. The same 
piece, uncomed, may be cooked in the 
same way, but should be salted when 
half cooked. 

Pressed Chicken or Veal 

Disjoint the chicken, cover both with 
boiling water, and let boil five minutes. 
Then simmer until tender; add salt 
when half cooked, remove bones and 
unedible portions, and put the meat 
into an oblong pan, and cover with 
a board bearing a weight. Prepared in 
this way, the meat does not hold to- 
gether very well in slicing. To obviate 
this defect, the meat may be chopped 
fine and packed in the pan, then a little 
of the broth^ seasoned well, may be 
poured over the meat, the board with 
weight set in place, and the dish set 
aside over night. 



QuBRY 1197. — Mrs. M. C. M., Schenectady, 
N.Y.: "Kindly give a list of desserts that 
are not fattening." 

Non-flesh-making Desserts 

All desserts mean sugar in some form, 
and, as sugar is fattening, this form 
of food would seem to be the very 
one to omit entirely. Why not sub- 
stitute a green vegetable or fruit 
salad with a bit of cheese for the sweet 
dish? Of course, some desserts are 
more fattening than others, butter, 
cream, and starch (flotu*, cornstarch, 
rice, tapioca, chocolate, etc.) all being 
fat-producers. Ivemon or orange jelly 
or a blanc-mange made with gelatine 
or sea-moss farine, all very lightly 
sweetened and taken without cream 
or sugar, are among those which we 
can suggest as the least objectionable 
in this respect. Sour apples baked 
and prunes stewed without sugar con- 
tain but littie sugar, and salted almonds 
are without sugar.

"Recipes for celery souffld, marron parfait, 
oatmeal wafers, and angel parfait in glasses " 

Celery Souffle 
Wash and drain the tender white 



stalks in a head of celery, discarding the 
leaves, and cut the stalks into fine 
slices. Add a slice of mild onion, 
two sprigs of parsley, and white broth 
or boiling water to cover. I^t cook 
about half an hotu* or until the celery 
is tender and the liquid nearly evapo- 
rated. Remove the parsley and about 
half the celery, and press the onion 
and rest .of the celery through a sieve. 
There should be of broth and ptu^ 
about one-third a cup. Melt two table- 
spoonfuls of butter; in it cook three 
tablespoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and one-fotuth a teaspoon- 
f td of paprika. Add the purte of celery 
and three-fourths a cup of rich milk, 
— one cup in all, — and stir imtil the 
sauce is boiling. Then beat in the 
beaten yolks of two eggs, one-fourth a 
cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and 
then cut and fold in the pieces of 
cooked celery (one cup) reserved for 
the purpose, and the whites of two 
eggs, beaten dry. Bake in a buttered 
souffle dish or in individual dishes. 

Marron Parfait, Bon Ton 

Potmd one-third a cup of blanched- 
and-browned almonds in a mortar, add- 
ing a teaspoonful of cream, occasion- 
ally, to facilitate the process. Scald 
the poimded almonds with a pint of 
thin cream, then press through a cheese- 
cloth. Add half a cup of sugar, and, 
when cold, freeze as ice-cream. Pass 
four otmces of marrons through a fine 
sieve. Add to the beaten yoUcs of 
three eggs, with one-third a cup of 
sugar and a few grains of salt. Cook 
and stir over boiling water until the 
mixture thickens, then set into ice 
water and beat until cold. Flavor 
with a teaspoonful of vanilla (two table- 
spoonfuls of curagoa may be added at 
discretion), then fold into the mixture 
one cup and a third of cream, beaten 
solid. Have a mould, lined with paper, 
standing in a pan of salt and crushed 
ice. Line the mould with the almond 
ice-cream, leaving part of the cream to

use later. Press into the cream lightly 
a cup of preserved strawberries, drained 
slightly, then put the chestnut mixture 
into the centre of the mould, covering 
it with the rest of the ice-cream. 
Spread a paper over the whole, press 
down the cover, and pack the mould in 
equal measures of salt and crushed ice. 
Let stand two hours before serving. 

For plain marron parfait omit the 
ice-cream lining and the strawberries. 
Simply freeze the marron preparation 
— poured into a mould closed to 
exclude salt water — ^in equal measures 
of salt and crushed ice. 

Oatmeal Wafers 

Beat an egg very light without sep- 
arating the white and yolk. Add one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
a teaspoonful of vanilla, half a table- 
spoonful of softened butter, half a cup 
of sugar, and one cup and a fourth of 
Quaker rolled oats. Beat together 
thoroughly, and drop from a teaspoon 
onto a buttered tin. Bake in a slow 
oven. 

Angel Parfait in Glasses 

Boil three-fourths a cup of sugar 
and half a cup of water until it spins 
a thread three inches in length. Then 
pour the syrup in a fine stream onto 
the whites of two eggs, beaten dry. 
Beat until the mixtiu"e is cold. Then 
add a scant tablespoonful of vanilla 
extract, and fold in one pint of cream, 
beaten firm. Turn the mixture into 
a mould or the can of a freezer, and 
when securely covered, to avoid salt 
water, surround with equal measures 
of salt and crushed ice. Let stand

After Typhoid 

The Insatiable Appetite must be Carefully 

Watched 

An attack of typhoid fever usually 



leaves one with an enormous appetite. 
The wasted body cries out for food 
material to repair the loss of body 
tissues. 

If care is not used, the weakened 
digestive organs may be overwhelmed 
before they have become strong. 

There is no food that has the tissue- 
building and energy-producing quali- 
ties equal to Grape-nuts. 

This food is predigested. The organs 
are relieved of the necessity of digest- 
ing it. It is concentrated, affording 
much nourishment with little bulk; 
contains all the essential food elements 
for repair and energy. It is therefore 
valuable under conditions of health' 
as well as convalescence. 

A CaUfomia young lady learned the 
truth about Grape-nuts. She writes: — 

"About four years ago I had a 
severe attack of typhoid fever. After 
recovering, I had a wild longing for 
food which nothing seemed to satisfy. 

"I tried the best of everjrthing, 
but was always weak and htmgry. 
A change to a milder climate did not 
mend matters, — food did not agree 
with me. 

**A friend persuaded me to try 
Grape-nuts. To my great surprise I 
did not experience that himgry feel- 
ing between meals. It was a great 
relief, and I kept on eating it with 
great benefit. 

"Grape-nuts not only relieved that 
wild craving for food, but made me 
stronger in mind and body, — ^relieved 
old headaches, weakness, strengthened 
my nerves, so that I was easily able 
to do my work. 

**I have never tired of Grape-nuts, 
as one does of most cereal foods. My 
friends were so surprised at my im- 
proved condition after eating Grape- 
nuts regularly that many have bene- 
fited by my experience." Name given

Blue Blood 

May be Aristocratic, but it^s Liable to cause 
Cold Hands and Feet 

Wherever the idea that blue-blooded 
ancestry is the best may have origi- 



nated, the fact is, phydologically speak- 
ing, blue blood is bad blood. 

That is to say, the blood in the veins 
which is dark, and appears blue through 
the white skin, is that portion of the 
blood stream laden with the waste of 
refuse material of the system, after the 
red blood (arterial) has carried real 
food to the tissues. ''Red blood" is 
to-day the mark of Nature's aristocrat. 

When, from imperfect nutrition, the 
blood loses its rich red color, and be- 
comes dark, or **blue," the result is cold 
hands and feet and more or less pal- 
pitation of the heart, as well as 
general weakness. Coffee-drinking, in 
many persons, causes blue blood, and 
does not insiu-e any coat-of-arms or 
ancient pedigree, except the ancient 
habit of coffee.drinldng itself. A 
"blue-blooded" woman writes: — 

**I drank coffee for ten years. My 
head was dizzy, I had constant heart- 
bum, could not sleep nights, my 
hands and feet were cold summer and 
winter, my blood was poor and thin. 
[Blue Blood!] 

"Seeing so much said in praise of 
Postum in the papers, my husband 
and I decided to try it. That was 
more than a year ago, and we have 
used it ever since. 

"Now my head is not dizzy, my 
hands and feet are always warm, my 
nerves are steady, and I can sleep all 
night. A few weeks ago, calling at a 
friend's house, ^ they said: *What in 
the world have you been doing? You 
look ten years younger. I never saw 
you look so well.' 

' * When I told them it was on account 
of Postum, that I had quit drinking 
coffee, they could hardly believe it 
But some time after they told me they 
had been using Postum, too, had quit 
coffee, and were so much better every 
way." Name given by Postum Com-

Bread and Butter 

By John A. Morris 



T,HE art of making bread from 
wheat is said to have been 
first taught by Ctiing-Notmg, 
1998 B.C. In 1913 B.C. Melchisedek 
brought out wine and bread to Abram, 
and blessed him (Gen. xivi iS). Fif- 
teen years later we find Abraham giv- 
ing three strangers a morsel of bread 
to stay their appetites, while his 
wife prepared hot cakes, made of fine 
meal, kneaded and, probably, cooked 
in the ashes, as they had not then 
seen the Hg>'pttao plan of cooking in 
ovens. This was served up with but- 
ter (probably bonny dabbu' or curds), 
milk, and veal. 

The Hebrew bread was a flat cake, 
baked on the hearth or on a metallic 
plate. It was broken, not cut, and 
may have had indentations to form 
lines of easy fracture. 

In the time of Pliny, bread was 
made from a variety of grains, but 
wheat was held in the highest esti- 
mation. The wheat of Italy ranked 
first in weight and whiteness, while 
that of Sicily, one of the granaries 
of Rome, stood third, Boeotian wheat 
being preferred to it. 

The Romans leavened their bread 
with preparations similar to that known 
in some places as "salt rising" instead 



of yeast. The leaven is described as 
being made from millet, mixed with 
grape juice, which, it is said, would 
keep a whole year. Pine wheat bran 
was also used, mixed with white must 
(or grape juice) three days old, dried 
in the sun, and made into small cakes. 
For making bread these cakes were 
first soaked in water, boiled with the 
finest spelt flour, and then mixed with 
the dough. I,eavcn for immediate 
use was also prepared by kneading 
some of the flour, without salt, boil- 
ing it to the consistency of porridge, 
and keeping it until it began to turn 
sour; or the bread was leavened by 
means of some of the dough left over, 
purposely, from the previous day, as 
among the ancient Hebrews. In the 
maritime districts the flour was mixed 
with sea water to save the salt. 

There were no professional bakers 
in Rome until after the war with 
King Perseus, more than 580 years after 
the building of the city. The occupa- 
tion belonged solely to the women. The 
RomanA ate their bread moist. It was 
sometimes kneaded with the must of the 
grape, with raisin juice, or with butter 
for shortening, or with eggs and milk, 
and often it was soaked in milk and 
honey before eating. Vinegar, in

which to soak bread was a regular 
ration of the Roman soldiers. 

After the conquest of Macedonia, 
148 B.C., Greek bakers came to Rome, 
and monopolized the business. Loaves 
of bread, or their pseudo-morphs, 
were found in the excavations of 
Pompeii, partially buried a.d. 79. 

Bread was made with yeast by the 
English bakers in 1634, and bread- 
making machinery was introduced into 
England in 1 858. Bread was arti- 
ficially inflated with carbonic add 
gas, with which the water in mixing 
was impregnated, by Dr. Danglish 
in 1859. Aerated bread was made 
in the United States prior to 1854. 

Butter was made by the andents 
for various purposes. Hipocrates rec- 
ommended it for an ointment, as did 
also Galen, a.d. 151. Aristotle speaks 
of it as the oily part of milk; Strabo 
speaks of its use by the Ethiopians; 
and Plutarch tells of a Spartan lady 
anointed with butter, and smelling so 
loudly that Berenice, the hostess, could 
not stand it. Berenice, however, 
smelled so strongly of rancid oil that 
the Spartan visitor was soon glad to . 
leave. 

Diosconides and Galen refer to the 
use of butter as a substitute for olive 
oil, as a dressing for table use or for 
leather. Lampblack obtained by 
the burning of butter they recom- 
mended for an eye salve. 

The Romans used butter for anoint- 
ing, the Gennans for hair-dressing, 
and the Egyptians for burning. The 
Christians of Egypt used butter in- 
stead of oil for their lamps, in the third 
century. 

The butter received at Constan- 
tinople from the Crimea and Kuban 
is not salted. It is prepared by melt- 
ing in large pans, and skimming ofl 
the impurities which rise to the sur- 
face. Butter thus prepared is called 
ghee in India. It is used as food by 
some castes, and for anointing. Ghee 
is used to soak the wood on which 
the victim of the suttee is sacrificed.

Rest, Exercising, Dieting, All Aid 

Woman who thinks that she doesn't need 
them is Much in Error 

"The woman who has no time for 
relaxation and systematic exercise," 
says a weU>known physician, *4s pre- 
cisely the woman who most needs to 
take it. Rest, exercise, diet, amuse- 
ment, and work are of equal impor- 
tance in the vast scheme of living, if 
one would live sanely, that is, health- 
fully. The old saying, *A11 work and 
no play makes Jack a dull boy,' is per- 
fectly true, and that all play and no 
work have the same e£Fect is equally 
correct. It is the wise adjustment of 
the proportion of each that makes for 
health." 

"I get all the exercise I need in going 
about my household duties," many 
women assert, but that is the greatest 
mistake possible. Under ordinary cir- 
cumstances a few sets of muscles are 
called into activity, and the mind, at 
the same time, is fully occupied. For 
physical exercise to be helpful, the mind 
should be at rest. A walk of twenty 
minutes' duration in the open air is an 
absolute daily necessity, and should be 
at a reasonably brisk pace. 

Deep breathing should be practised 
on these walks until it becomes a fixed 
habit. A good plan is to inhale slowly 
while taking seven steps, then exhale 
during seven. The mental application 
soon ceases to be necessary, and the 
walker almost unconsciously breathes 
in this way. Deep breathing is helpful 
in cases of insomnia also. 

The average woman takes too little 
care of her health until she loses it, 
and then she takes too much care of it, 
with tonics. She drinks two or three 
cupfuls of strong cojffee for breakf^t, 
eats meat three times a day, takes 
cakes and ices ad infinitum, and by the 
time she is thirty or earlier has estab-

eating than from overworking, and far 
greater danger to beauty. 

Another hindrance to health and con- 
sequently beauty is the wearing of un- 
necessary clothing. The body breathes 
through the skin, and when layer after 
layer of cotton and wool envelop it, so 
that no breathing is possible, the whole 
physical organism suffers. 



For the Chest Cold 
If one is frequently taking cold and 
it seems to be in the bronchial tubes or 
one feels as if some one was gripping 
her at the base of throat, try the cold- 
water treatment. Bare the chest, and, 
leaning over a t>owl, dash water upon 
the chest until it glows and feels warm. 
This will relieve the tightness, and will 
prevent the many colds. 

If going to a party and wishing to wear 
a low-necked gown, try this treatment 
before and upon returning. Alcohol 
rubbed well over the chest and shoulders 
will also prevent taking cold when 
dressing the neck low. 



The tortoise is a great sleeper. The 
Spectator has had a story of one which 
was a domestic pet in an Engli^ house. 
As his time for hibernating drew nigh, 
he selected a quiet comer in the dimly 
lit coal cellar, and there composed him- 
self to sleep. A new cook was ap- 
pointed soon after. She knew not tor- 
toises. In a few months the tortoise 
woke up, and sallied forth. Screams 
soon broke the kitchen's calm. On 
entering that department, the lady of 
the house found the cook gazing in 
awe -struck wonder, and exclaiming, 
as with unsteady hand she pointed to 
the tortoise: "My conscience! Look 
at the stone which I've broken the coal 
wi' a' winter!" 

The President and Mrs. Roosevelt ate 
a 30-cent lunch in a Panama restaurant, 
and the President pronounced it good 
enough for anybody. Mrs. Roose- 
velt's opinion is not recorded.

The Aristocrat of the Breakfast Table 



EIGHTY MILES OF FRUIT TREES in a single grove ! Thaf s the 
Grape Fruit grove of The cAtwood Co., Manavista, Fla. — 25,000 trees 
bearing the finest Grape Fruit in the world. 

No fruit surpasses Grape Fruit in system-cleansing, health-giving qual- 
ities ; but all Grape Fruit is not well bred. It has required superior soil, 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a thorough knowledge of citrus cul- 
ture to bring forth an c>4.twood Pomelo, or Grape Ffuit, as it is generally 
called. You'll readily distinguish it from the rough, thick-skinned or bitter 
sort, and will be delighted with its abundant, luscious juice. See that your 
dealer sells you the cAtwood brand. Sold only in trade-mark wrappers. 

Incomparable as a break&st fruit, Grape Fruit may also be eaten oh 
retiring, with fine curative effects. After cutting in cross sections, remove 
the core and serve with or without sugar. It is better when served with- 
out ice. 

Don't be afraid to buy the o4.twood Grape Fruit by the box ; it will 
keep for weeks.

Edison talks about Work and Diet 
The following "heart-to-heart'' con- 
fidence by Edison, the great ■ electri- 
cian, begins like a patent medicine 
testimonal, but his suggestions stand 
for its genuineness, and the Wizard 
himself could but be pleased to have 
his simple yet important discoveries 
widely read and faithfully followed:— 

"Some time ago my stomach troubled 
me. I didn't know what was the 
matter. Whenever my trouble was 
acute, I began to experiment with my 
diet to see what woidd come of it. I 
had always been a light eater, but 1 
decided to cut down my food still 
more. 

"For two months I lived on four 
ounces of food for each meal. That 
made twelve ounces of food a day. Of 
course, I varied my food. I would take 
a teaspoonful of peas, a small piece of 
toast and caviar, a tiny sandwich, a 
little bit of ham, a fragment of rye 
bread with Swiss cheese. 

"What was the result? At the end 
of two months of this diet I weighed 
just as much as when I began, exactly 
185 pounds. I found that living on 
twelve ounces of food a day made me 
mentally brighter, and had neither 
diminished my strength nor my weight. 

"Another common mistake is to look 
upon hard work as injurious. You see 
Mr. This - That - and- the - Other - Fellow 
announcing that he has been working 
very hard, and must go off to Europe 
for a rest. Bosh I He has been eat- 
ing and drinking too much, and hasn't 
worked half enough. The healthy man 
can't work too hard or too much. 
When his work tires him out, he will 
go to sleep, and will get the right kind 
of sleep." 



In Philadelphia 
I might not fall, as Adam did. 

Before an apple; 
But, Satan, make for me no bid

CRESCr 




Food Adulteration 
It is not every growing journal which 
has been willing to admit any necessity 
for a pure food law in the several States. 
It is interesting therefore to read the 
following editorial from the Grocery 
World oi Philadelphia for October 8: — 

"One thing even the most conserva- 
tive student of the food problem must 
admit, — that the doctoring of food, as 
revealed by the campaign for better 
food laws, has progressed to an amaz- 
ing extent. 

"It is undeniable that little or none 
of the food we eat to-day is natural 
or normal. Canned goods are bleached 
with sulphites or colored with coal tar 
or artificially sweetened with coal tar; 
dried fruits are bleached with sulphur 
or blackened with lampblack or moist- 
ened with glycerine; genuine planta- 
tion New Orleans molasses is bleached 
with sulphites; sugar is blued to im- 
prove its color, and so on. Whether 
these are frauds, innocent or harmful, 
is not the point. The point is that we 
are being robbed of normal food, and 
the fact that some of us would prefer 
abnormal food, such, for instance, as 
artificially colored butter, is also be- 
side the question. 

"The only real objection which can 
be raised against some of these food- 
sophisticating practices is that the pub- 
lic are ignorant of them. Being igno- 
rant, they are that much defrauded. No 
law can deprive a man of the right to 
eat artificially colored sugar if he wants 
to: the only thing which the law can 
do is to see that he is not given arti- 
ficially colored sugar under the repre- 
sentation, express or implied, that he 
is getting sugar naturally colored. So 
that the reasonable solution of the 
dilemma of the manufacturers, who 
say the public will not take their prod- 
ucts unless treated, is first to treat 
them harmlessly, if at all, and then to 
tell the public precisely what they have 
done. In the main, that course would 
satisfy every food law on the books."

One part of an elevator boy's duty 
is to answer questions, but not even an 
elevator boy can be expected to know 
everything. A guest at one of the tug 
hotels, while going down in the elevator, 
remarked to the colored elevator man, 
"I want to go to the wharf where the 
tea was thrown overboard." "Well," 
said the man, looking mystified, "you'd 
better inquire at the office. I reckon 
that was before I came here. I've only 
been in Boston about a year." — Boston

Somewhere To-day 

Jane Dransfield Stone 



Somewhere to-day the woods are green 
And moist and sweet with shade, 

Somewhere to-day the thrush doth sing 
From secret leafy glade, — 
Somewhere to-day. 

Somewhere to-day the water gleams 

And glistens in the smi, 
As if a thousand jewels rare 

Upon its breast were flung,— 
Somewhere to-day. 

Somewhere to-day the strawberry 

Doth ripen on the hill. 
The cattle dip the juicy grass 

And wander at their will, — 
Somewhere to-day. 



Somewhere to-day the pathways wind 

Along the singing brooks, • 
By open fields and then again 

Through fragrant vine-hung nooks,— 
Somewhere to-day 

Somewhere to-day the wild flowers bloom. 

The insects hum and sing, 
The clouds like dream-thoughts come and go. 

The birds pass swift awing, — 
Somewhere to-day. 

Somewhere to-day a rich life-stream 
Doth pulse from Nature's heart. 

And I in fancy o'er its brink 
Do lean and sip a part, — 
Somewhere to-day.

The Old Serving-n> 



Memorial Hall and its Kitchens at 
Harvard College 

By Grace Agnes Thompson 

HOW many persons know what restoration shut off securely from the 

the kitchens of a big dining chill gales. If it is summer, the wide 

institution are like? Most of room looks so cool and inviting, with 

us have experienced the delightfully its electric fans, its white tables and 

comforting little thrill of anticipation shining glass and silver, and its ferns 

that one is sure to feel on entering a and potted palms.. The waiter, who is 

first-class caf£, tired and hungry. If so promptly at one's side, too, is promise 

it Is winter, the place is so suggestive of a care-free hour to follow. One sinks 

of wannth, a little world of physical into one's seat and takes up the menu

card with a satisfied sense of being ut- 
terly at peace with existence. 

But behind all this orderly comfort 
that appeals SO keenly to the human 
creature? All the diners do not come 
at one time. There is a long and varied 
bill of fare from which each may choose. 
How can so many different dishes be 
prepared and served appetizingly hot 
to so many different individuals at so 
many different times without any one 
having to wait? If one happens to 
think of it, one is, perhaps, vaguely 
conscious that somewhere beyond the 
swinging doors are other rooms that are 
known as the kitchens, and one thinks 
vaguely of the home department of the 
same name. But multiply the familiar 
family cuisine by one hundred, and the 
multifold edition will still fall short in 
comparison. Excepting only those who 
have worked in such kitchens, it is safe 
to say that not one in five hundred has 
any idea what a coniphcated set of 



rooms the culinary department of a 
large dining institution is, or what an 
intricate task it is to supply a large 
number of diners with fresh -cooked 
food, rapidly and successfully. A few 
have, perhaps, visited the kitchen and 
serving-rooms of some large hotel or 
restaurant, and wondered at the maze of 
kettles, bread -troughs, and tables, the 
long ranges, the heaps of earthenware, 
and the white- aproned cooks and waiters 
bustling to and fro, yet never seeming 
to be in anybody's way. Yet all these 
places arc really quite tame compared 
with Memorial Hall, the largest dining- 
hall connected with Harvard College. 

It is a remarkable and interesting 
place. There is nothing like it any- 
where else on earth. A massive build- 
ing of brick and stone, ivy -covered 
from earth to eave, so Uke, in many 
details, the exterior of a church that 
strangers often imagine it to be one, 
having a long, nave-like wing at one 



The Dining-hall » it is To-day 



Memorial Hall and its Kitchens 



Another Vien of the Old Serving-n 



end, and a broad rotunda, known as 
Sanders Theatre, at the other, the 
central part of the structure capped by a 
high clock tower, and the whole set 
within grassy lawns just across a street 
from the college campus, — such is 
Memorial Hall, dear to the heart of 
every Harvard man, prized almost as 
much by the people of Cambridge. 
The building was erected in 1873 from 
funds provided by the various Harvard 
classes in the memory of all Harvard 
men who fell in the battles of the Civil 
War. It was intended only for Com- 
mencement purposes, — a place where 
the Commencement and alumni dinners 
might be enjoyed each year, and the 
annual speeches made. The idea of 
utilizing the splendid new building as a 
regular eating-hall developed later, 
when, after another year of rapid in- 
crease, the Thayer Hall diners found 
their quarters too narrow for their 
numbers. Then the Harvard Dining 
Association came into existence. 

That was thirty-two years ago. Now 



more than thirteen hundred strong, in 
spite of restaurants, lunch-rooms, din- 
ing-clubs, and boarding-houses on every 
side, the Association gives promise of 
still greater growth. Even the build- 
ing has been altered here and there to 
meet the greater demand. But this 
iilteration was no mere touch of chaqge 
at long inten'als. Most of it took place 
within the brief limits of the summer 
holidays, when last year a new wing 
was added to the side of the long nave- 
like part of the building that contains 
the dining-hall, and the kitchen and 
serving departments were entirely re- 
modeled and modernized and their 
capacity vastly enlarged. 

Yet these alterations, extensive as - 
they were, did not compass a complete 
transformation. The transformation is 
hidden away in those mysterious sub- 
terranean spaces which so few besides 
the employees of the Hall have ever 
seen. Outside there is ever the stately 
splendor of the Shakespeare Memorial 
in London, after which the Hall was

modeled, and, were it not for the ap- 
petizing odors that frequently freight 
the atmosphere round the building and 
the steam that is almost always Ut be 
seen rising from some exhaust-pipe, no 
one would guess that anything so un- 
sptritual as eating ever occurred inside 
those ivy -curtained walls. The visitor 
who wanders into Memorial Hall be- 
tween meal hours strolls through the 
great central corridor and admires the 
exquisite, stained-glass windows at 
either end, and reflects what a peaceful 
place it is. Then he pushes open the 
swinging doors half-way down the wall 
opposite the Sanders Theatre end of the 
building, and enters the long dining-hall. 
Here, too, it is peaceful,— in a grand, 
lofty sort of way. The beautiful win- 
dows down each long wall interpaneled 
with fine old paintings, and the high 
vaulted roof and heavy dark wood of 
the rafters and paneling, are responsible 
for the impression of grandeur. 

It seems almost incredible that just 
the distance of a floor underneath this 
splendid stillness is the whirr of ma- 
chinery, the throb of engines, and the 



bustle of scores of hurrying feet. Such 
a change as one short flight of stairs 
can bring ! 

The way to the kitchen is along a 
short passage that leads from the long 
walk to the right, past the largest of the 
storerooms, where boxes and bales and 
barrels of eatables piled to the ceiling 
on all sides tell the story of healthy, 
hungry young fellows who eagerly seek 
the tables above three times a day. 
Presently you pass through a doorway, 
and suddenly find yourself in a very 
large room, where you are greeted by 
the aroma from several cauldrons of 
bubbling soup. But you forget the 
hungry feeling that that aroma creates 
in you to admire the whiteness of the 
walls and ceiling and til.ed floor, and 
the shining brass of the many pipes 
and the polished copper of the kettles. 

In this room all the cooking of vege- 
tables and meats is done. In a long 
double row through the centre of the 
space at the upper end of the room are 
the great kettles and steamers, their 
contents kept at the boiling-point by a 
system of steam pipes. First ts the

trig r25-galloii stock pot, where the 
soup stock is made. Then two loo- 
gallon and two 80-gaUun kettles for 
the soups thcmselveii. In the latter 
the prepared stock is cooked, together 
with the seasoning and suitable vege- 
tables. Next are two 20-gaIIon copper 
kettles for the cooking of cereals and 
eight large steamers for vegetables; 
for at Memorial Hall all vegirtiiblcs are 
cooked by stt.-aiu, instead of being boiled 
in water in the old, unscientific way. 

At the right of the entrance to the 
kitchen are two great brick roasting 
ovens, each measuring twelve by fifteen 
feet. Chops are "on the bill" for 
to-day. we will suppose, and it is nearly 
time for the serving of lunch. There- 
fore, one of these ovens holds a number 
of great trays of potatoes — hundreds of 
them — baking in the even heat. These 
ovens are the old-fashioned kind, such 
as our forefathers had, with a fire in 
one corner, only here it is a fire of coal, 
and not of wood. For, as Mr. JalUet, 
the superintendent of Memorial Hall, 



says, " Nothing better has ever been in- 
vented than a good, substantial bride 
oven." 

Beyond the ovens is the 8-fire range, 
35 feet long, the longest range in New 
England. And beyond this are two big 
36-inch broilers, where deep beds of red- 
hot charcoal toast the chops and 
steaks almost the instant they come 
into contact with the intense heat, thus 
cooking in the juices that add so much 
to the palatableness and the whole- 
someness of the meat. You pause, 
fa'^inated, to watch a man who 
stands before one of these broilers, 
with two spits, lifting slices of nice, 
fresh looking meat from the big tray 
that stands on the shelf in front of the 
coals, and dropping them on to the glow- 
ing bed, or turning others, and changing 
them as fast as he can handle them. 

A narrow iron staircase leads up from 
the kitchen to the serving-room above, 
the ground floor of the new wing. This 
is one of the finest and most up-to-date 
rooms for the purpose in the country. 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



In the New Serving- rx 



Shtoing whiteness and cleanliness exist 
everywhere. Ingenious modern con- 
trivances meet all sanitary and speed 
demands. Dumb-waiters bring the 
(bod up from the kitchen and bake- 
shop. A series of big tanks in gradu- 
ated sizes for cofTee, cereal coffee, tea, 
and cocoa, stand in a row near the 
entrance to the dining-room, and at 
right angles to them is the long booth 
with ax. compartments for different 
kinds of ice-cream and sherbets. AH 
the appointments are so arranged that 
more than a himdred men can move 
about in the spaces between the tables 
and racks without hindering each other, 
and serve the food with tbe utmost 
possible speed. The room may be said 
to be divided across the middle into twin 
rooms, for the opposite ends are exact 
duplicates of each other, — a feature 
which is of the greatest advantage in 
dealing with a dining-hall so long as 
that of Memorial Hall. 

The dishes are kept in iron racks 
with sliding glass doors, each kind of 
dish in its own especial compartment, 
•o that no confusion can take place 



during the moments of greatest rush. 
Behind these dish-racks at the upper 
end of the room, and partially par- 
titioned off by them, you will notice 
another section of the department, — 
tables loaded with piles of dishes, and 
beyond, along two sides of the wall, 
what you may call a row of sinks. 
This is the dish-room, where dishes 
from tbe tables are brought. If your 
visit had been timed a half-hour later. 
you are told, you might have had an 
opportunity to observe a dozen girb 
engaged here in the womanly occupatioo 
of dish-washing. But it is twentieth- 
century dish -washing. All the table 
ware is cleansed after the manner in 
use on large ocean steamers. Racks 
which hold the crockery and yet keep 
the pieces separate are placed for a 
moment in closed tanks, through which 
is flowed a constant stream of clean 
boiling water, which thoroughly cleans 
and sterilizes each dish. Then the racks 
are lifted out, and the dishes are almost 
immediately dried by their own heat. 

Your guide now directs you to the 
great dining-room of Memorial Hall. 



Memorial Hall and its Kitchens 



315 



The great apartment is 175 feet long by 
75 feet in breadth, and contams 76 tables. 

It seats at one time 885 men, or 150 
more than before the change. Each 
table of average size seats about twelve 
men, who are usually good friends, as 
the club method is in vogue. Table 
43, half-way down the room on the 
left, is especially pointed out to you as 
that at which Teddy Roosevelt, Jr., is 
accustomed to eat. 

Three times daily during the college 
year just past 1,320 men have been fed, 
besides the 225 persons required to 
minister to their hunger. This is a 
large number to be fed regularly every 
day during the greater part of a year. 
Few of the largest restaurants and 
summer hotels supply a larger number 
with even the "light refreshments*' 
that amusement-seekers are so fond of 
treating themselves to again and again 
in a single day. At the same time the 
remarkably high standard of Memorial 
Hall makes it a model among eating. 
places. Since the new serving-room 
and kitchen were completed, the de- 
partment has become one of the most 
modem and sanitary in the world. 
Perfect cleanUness is in order every- 
where. The new wing is finished with 
white-tiled floors and walls and open 
plumbing. There is not a comer any- 
where in which dust can collect. The 
various tables and racks and floors are 
required to be thoroughly washed every 
day and the brass piping kept in a state 
of shining polish. It entails no small 
amount of labor, but it pays. No one 
hears complaints nowadays from the 
young men who eat at Memorial Hall 
of badly cooked food that repulses 
one's appetite, of soiled dishes and 
microbe, or of long waits for something 
to eat when one is half starved and has 
only a brief half-hour to spare. 

The credit for these happy conditions 
goes where it belongs, — to the efiicient 
management of Mr. Jaillet, and to the 
skill of his assistants, the cooks, the 
bakers, and the 135 colored waiters. 



And the practical value of the Hall 
to Harvard students Ues in the fact 
that it is not in any sense a money- 
making institution. On the other 
hand, it is an institution with an 
aim, — to supply the students and teach- 
ing force of the college with the very 
best possible fare in tempting variety 
at minimum rates. For the small 
sum of $2.90 per week one may Uve 
at Memorial, and live well. Thus the 
poor student may enjoy the table 
society of his more wealth-favored 
college mates without any mental 
anxiety about his allowance, while the 
most Epicurean appetite may satisfy 
itself without offence. Doubtless, for 
these very reasons Memorial Hall has 
the advantage over hotels and res- 
taurants, where the price must equal 
the fare and service. But it fills its 
own particular niche in the world in 
the most admirable and interesting way. 

With this motive in view Memorial 
Hall has at last also opened its doors 
to the seven hundred and more students 
who yearly register for the famous 
summer school at Harvard. Women 
as well as men, the families of professors 
and instructors of the college, — ^any 
one, in short, connected with Harvard 
may live at Memorial Hall during the 
six weeks of the summer school at the 
same rates as those charged the winter 
students. 

Memorial Hall is, in fact, a part of 
the normal university life at Harvard. 
For, while there are several exclusive 
clubs where some of the multi-millions- 
men prefer to dine, the average student 
feels that to go to Harvard without 
eating at Memorial is not really to go 
to Harvard at all. ' 'This is the table," 
your guide will say, as you walk through 
the long dining-hall, "where So-and-so, 
the lawyer, used to sit; and over there 
we had two men who have been senators 
since, and a great geologist," etc. So 
the place has an historical setting that 
is quite as attractive as its practical 
value. 



Honoria the Second 

By AHx Thorn 



THE hollyhocks were all a 
pink glory that July afternoon. 
Tall and stately, they faced 
the old house, and no one but a need- 
lessly suspicious person could have 
guessed that they sheltered Honoria. 
A searching party had passed, not long 
since, composed of Jane and Mops, 
the spaniel, in full cry. Little was 
required to fire Mops with enthusiasm. 
His life was ever a series of delightful 
excitements, and on this occasion 
there was no exception. With praise- 
worthy self-control, Honoria refrained 
from calling softly to her boon com- 
panion, '*Here, Mopsy, here!" for 
Jane would then have taken her, an 
unwilling captive, back to the loathed 
nursery, and insisted upon pushing 
rigid, dimpled arms into starched 
sleeves, would have passed a harsh 
comb through unruly curls, fastened 
a floppy bow in said curls, and the 
child's unhappiness would have been 
complete. 

Now even the echo of the energetic 
Irishwoman's footsteps on the gravel 
had died away, and Honoria was free 
to come forth. An alluring world 
stretched safe in the opposite direction : 
rows of gay flower beds in the fore- 
ground, tenanted only by bees; velvety 
spaces of lawn, barred by long shadows; 
while still farther on lay the wide, 
shady street. 

The child looked strangely out of 
place in this tranquil landscape, clothed 
simply, yet most comfortably, in over- 
alls as blue as those inscrutable eyes 
of hers. She walked along leisurely, 
past dignified mansions, whose prim 
colonial fronts concealed sundry well- 
mannered little maids, acquaintances 
one and all, who were being buttoned 
and hooked into fresh frocks, wilder- 
nesses of stiff petticoats, and the like. 
Honoria knew the whole alarming 



list, and, rejoicing in her freedom, 
passed out of sight down a blossoming 
turn. 

When, four years before, instead of 
the much-desired boy a second girl 
came to "The Glebe," where genera- 
tions of the Carringtons had lived out 
peaceful if uneventful lives, great was 
the consternation. Both grandmothers 
had stood, that portentous day, at the 
long window that opened upon the 
lawn, silently watching Egbert Car- 
rington, as, with bent head and trou- 
bled, near-sighted eyes fixed on the 
smooth turf, he paced up and down 
in the twilight. 

A neighbor hurried up the path. 
"I needn't ask. One look at your 
face tells me," she remarked, sinking 
down on the piazza settle and fanning 
herself vigorously. * ' Named her yet ? ' ' 

"Clara already decides that baby 
shall be called Honoria Dtmscoinbe, 
after her grand-aunt, Honoria," re- 
plied Clara's mother, in her deep 
even tones. A quick look passed be- 
tween the three women. 

"A very wise decision, too," added 
Egbert's mother. "My son thoroughly 
approves of the choice. He takes his 
affliction in a fine spirit, — does Egbert. 
Had things been otherwise, the child 
would have borne the name of Egbert 
Maturin Carrington, 3d." 

"Well, as it is, this girl has a pretty 
big mouthful of a name," volunteered 
the cheerful neighbor, rising as she 
spoke. "Don't doubt she'll grow up 
to be just such another nice-mannered 
little girl as her sister Miriam is." 

A carefully worded letter despatched 
over the seas proceeded to inform Missi 
Honoria Dunscombe that on this s)(l§ 
the big pond there was a diminutive 
somebody that was to bear her name, 
also that the child was a vigorous 
specimen of babyhood, and bid foir 



Honoria the Second

to acquire the exact number of otmces 
due her each week. The writer neg- 
glected to add that, at this particular 
time, the parents were finding their 
chief comfort in the thought that their 
tiny daughter's future was thus fort- 
unately arranged. It is just possible 
that Miss Honoria could read between 
the lines. 

The reply, written in her delicate, 
spidery hand, was equally happy, 
assuring them of her satisfaction that 
they should have remembered a far- 
away relative, abd trusting that the 
young Honoria would continue to 
thrive. 

Honoria, indeed throve, but, as 
time pass^, careful and conscientious 
examination of the family annals on 
either side failed to discover such an- 
other astonishing specimen of Brews- 
ter or Carrington. Small Miriam had 
stepped demurely along neat garden 
paths, holding fast to Jane's hand, 
shyly accepting proflfered blossoms, 
herself as dainty as a flower ; had made 
wonderful pilgrimages to the sun dial 
and back, the round trip taking full 
four minutes, unfailingly glad to re- 
turn to the shelter of the safe piazza; 
'vrould peep wonderingly through the 
hedge, but never dream of going beyond 
it; and draw abbreviated skirts care- 
fully aside, should a stray dog venture 
in, — a pattern baby, indeed, the joy 
of all the connections. 

Honoria, on the contrary, head well 
up, tramped boldly on her way, catch- 
ing at Canterbury bells, sweet-william, 
or like tempting blossoms within her 
reach, pulled a handful recklessly, and 
then threw them aside and sought the 
next new thing. Honoria in her fourth 
year — O! shades of departed Brews- 
ters and Carringtons — ^had on a certain 
autumn day been discovered by the 
stupefied Egbert conversing fluently 
with the men at the livery stable. 
Honoria making friends with all the 
dogs she met, pedigreed and unpedi- 
greed alike, was a familiar sight. 



while several times a week this ad- 
venturous little maid would be re- 
turned to her apprehensive family 
by some kindly woman, who found her 
wandering far, if not from the dwellings 
of men, yet from the purlieus of home. 
Jane tearfully protested that she never 
could dress a child whose habit it was 
to plant one small foot in a bureau 
drawer that stood conveniently open, 
"and her sister near at hand, all dressed 
up so sweet and nice. Ma'am." 

In the midst of this turmoil came 
a letter from Grand-aunt, Honoria 
Dunscombe, informing her niece and 
nephew that she had landed a few days 
before, and promised herself, the pleas- 
ure of a brief visit to ''The Glebe" the 
following week, when she should make 
the acquaintance of her little name- 
sake. 

The open window afforded a rare 
view of Honoria this morning, who, 
with yellow curls flying, closely followed 
by Mops, raced like a mad thing in the 
sunshine, pausing occasionally to give 
sundry shrill barks at a neighboring 
dog, who, tied to the back steps of his 
home, was loudly bewailing his lot. 
Clara shed some distracted tears, and 
Egbert stole back to his den, leaving 
his household in solemn conclave. 

Aimt Honoria was really coming, — 
dreaded Aunt Honoria, all-powerful 
Aunt Honoria, — ^who had not visited 
New England in many years. Clara 
had an indistinct remembrance of a 
richly gowned, impressive person, 
whose jewels had gleamed wondrously, 
— a fairy godmother, whom her kith 
and kin had f^ted, and whom the 
child had watched from her comer 
with eyes as awe-struck as if this 
strange aunt had stepped down from 
the wall out of some tarnished frame 
to grace the occasion with her shadowy 
presence. 

Tea was being served on the cool side 
piazza. Clara, a gracious figure in her 
violet muslin, lifted the ancient china 
with reverential fingers. Her aristo-

cratic face was qtiite drawn down with 
anxiety as she listened with pretty 
deference to Aunt Honoria's lively 
talk. A small, alert Aunt Honoria 
this, whose bright, dark eyes roved 
from peaceful piazza to more peaceful 
street, seen above the neatly clipped 
box. 

Miriam, not altogether unconscious 
of her best frock with its pink bows, 
came shyly up the steps, looking quite 
the lady girl as she stood by her 
mother's wicker chair. 

"And is this my small namesake?" 
inquired Aunt Honoria, suavely, hold- 
ing out her hand. 

**No, aunt," Clara tremblingly re- 
plied. **No, this is Miriam, our eldest 
daughter. ' ' Miriam softly answered the 
visitor's questions. Her satin smooth 
hair, with its squarely tied bows, 
formed a fitting frame for the meek 
little face. 

An untoward bustle and rush of 
feet in the parlor behind them startled 
all three. '*For shame, you naughty 
girl!" came Jane's voice. The glass 
doors opened quickly to admit Honoria 
the Second, her round cheeks flushed 
with victory, every separate curl stand- 
ing up wildly. Still wearing her fav- 
orite blue overalls, she stood in the 
doorway, — an incongruous little figure, 
composedly surveying the tea-drinking. 

Not in vain did Clara boast of heroic 
Puritan forefathers. Courageously she 
broke the sudden silence. "This, 
she said, "this is Honoria, aunt." 

Aunt Honoria hastily put down her 
cup, sat up straighter, if that were 



possible, her own cheeks pink, her 
gray curls quite quivering with some 
inner excitement. 

"Come to me, child," she exclaimed 
eagerly, holding out both hands to the 
new-comer. 

"No," replied, the child distinctly, 
"no," shaking her head to emphasize 
the remark, and hastily putting her 
small brown hands behind her. Mother 
and sister looked on hopelessly. Clara 
did not dare to glance at Aunt Honoria. 
Then Aunt Honoria laughed, and 
laughed again, taking ^ff her glasses 
to give herself up to the full enjoyment 
of the,occasion. 

"That child is perfectly refreshing, 
my dear," she cried, "delicious. She 
diverts me more than I can tell you. 
We shall be friends, — ^I know we shall, 
— ^attached friends. Send for my 
trunks, will you, Clara ? I am gratified 
that you should have named her for 
me, — truly gratified. Why, I was just 
such a child myself once, — ^just such a 
one. ' ' She seized the surprised Honoria 
by the hand. * * Come, * ' she said, * 'show 
me that dog that I hear loudly barking. 
Show me everything, Honoria Duns- 
combe." And the oddly assorted pair 
descended the steps, and sought the 
garden. Small Honoria had found 
her voice. Now the gypsy face was 
raised to the wrinkled one above it, 
and she chattered volubly in her high 
little voice. 

"EgbertI" called his wife. "Eg- 
bert! Oh, look out into the garden!" 
And the wondering Egbert looked, and 
was glad.

Organization 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



IS organization the best way by 
which to obtain trained minds 
and skilled hands? Many people 
say it is, practically speaking. Others, 
who are conservative by temperament 
and methods, believe that personality 
is the strongest as well as the final 
power by which progress is obtained. 
These two forces, which have always 
reacted upon each other, now confront 
one another with a stronger impulse 
than ever before; for one is focussed 
on trades-unions, the other on phil- 
anthropy. Yet both of the forces 
prove that the present is an age of 
co-operation rather than of private 
enterprise. 

Therefore comes the question. Is 
personality to be absorbed in general 
organization? Will looking after the 
welfare of the whole lessen individual 
sympathy ? And the answers will be 
varied according to each one's point of 
view. 

With the increasing organization of 
trades-uniofis among women another 
question arises. Are women as well 
fitted to organize as men? Will the 
over-supply of women^s work, its fre- 
quent inefficiency, and the low. wages 
too often paid the workers be changed 
and improved by organization? Shall 
organization extend to domestic ser- 
vice, in which in Massachusetts alone, 
according to the last census, there were 
90,342 so employed ? 

Granted that such unionism is of 
present benefit, is it to be superseded 
by something better? If so, why 
unionize ? On the other hand, appren- 
ticeships have been outgrown. Trade 
schools are as yet few, and there are 
two million women in industry. For 
them it is claimed that "organization- 
is the only way out. It may not be 
the final solution, but it is the only 
immediate practical one." 



Of the two methods suggested for 
such organization, the sympathy of 
the enthusiast is with the "ideal" 
method, "the righteousness of the 
cause," while the practical method 
relies upon the use of the imion "label" 
as the argument by which success is 
to be obtained. Following the * 'ideal " 
method entails self-sacrifice, bravery, 
and sadness. Still, the skilled are 
willing to suffer for the cause, if thereby 
they can persuade the ignorant and 
unskilled not to accept small wages, 
late hours, and unsanitary conditions. 

One of the curious but inevitable 
changes regarding the position of union 
men towards women in unions relates 
to the present admission of women. 
At first, it is said, the men wanted to 
keep them out. Now they want to 
push them in, since inside a union 
women are less of an obstacle to mas- 
culine skill, the working woman out 
of a union being much like the non- 
union man, at least it is so alleged 
Yet, as most of the men's unions now 
admit the necessity of equal pay for 
men and women, the latter should have 
the same trained efficiency as men, in 
order to compete with them. 

Given as an instance of heroism is 
that of a woman who was earning nearly 
twenty dollars a week, but who went 
out on a strike, disregarding her loss 
as an individual, because she believed 
the cause was right. But conditions 
vary in the different unions. In the 
Typographical Union, where conditions 
are fairly fair, many women are work- 
ing for far less than the union scale, 
for, not being trained, they prefer to 
take smaller pay than run the risk of 
losing their job. In the Women Book- 
binders' Union there is much loyalty. 
"They serve because they believe, and 
not because they hope to be served 
in turn."

One cannot help thinking that for the 
cause of the union it is fortunate so 
many women are not married. When 
they are, shall they go out on strike? 
Is marriage a bar to being an outside 
worker, provided one needs work. 
There are two sides to everjrthing, but 
the recent discussions anent married 
women as teachers can arise at any 
time concerning women in other em- 
ployments. Many a married woman 
must work from force of unfortunate 
circumstances. Other married women 
have such conspicuous ability for one 
or another kind of work that they 
should not be deprived of the right to 
work just because they are married. 
They afe but rare exceptions when 
women neglect home or children for 
the sake of outside duties. Usually 
it is for their sake that they do work 
outside the home. But in debarring 
married women from work of any kind 
it is forgotten that the dignity of 
marriage itself suffers, and that the 
true comradeship of marriage demands 
that the woman shall have freedom of 
choice in decisions which affect herself 
as well as her so-called duties. The 
more there is of organization, the more 
carefully must women consider whether 
marriage is to circumscribe their vo- 
cations or avocations, or, in simpler 
terms, their ability to be classed as 
workers outside their homes. 

Some women have an innate knack 
at organization, bom presumably of 
their ability to manage a home. In 
the Tobacco Strippers' Union this 
ability is very marked, for it is an in- 
dependent organization of some seven 
hundred members, which after a period 
of struggle was finally and successfully 
formed. Their very success raises an- 
other question, whether, if unions are 
the best ways of working, it is not 
advisable that they should be inde- 
pendent, ofScered and financed by 
women rather than dependent upon 
or even affiliated with men's unions. 

The garment workers have many 



problems to solve, owing to their 
various kinds of work and the tm- 
skilled status of many of the workers 
who are foreigners, so that a large 
number of them go into a "label union," 
not from personal enthusiasm, but 
because, as in that way the employer 
can sell his work, they in turn must 
either work for him or else suffer. 
So far the Overall Makers' Union is 
said to be the most hopeful among the 
garment workers. Ninety per cent, of 
its employees are women, who actually 
have part in the affairs of the union. 
The women are welcomed partly be- 
cause, if inside, they help to keep up 
the standard of wages, for, if not ad- 
mitted, they might or would work for a 
smaller wage than the men, and thus 
indirectly take away the work from 
the men. 

Judged by its quantitative results, 
the history of women's unions is not 
very encouraging. Those who believe 
in them claim that with industrial 
training and trade schools women will 
have the same impulse towards busi- 
ness organization as have men. But 
will they? Is there a better way? 
Perhaps not now, but, if unionism, 
it should avoid some of the mistakes 
that have been made, and to the "ideal" 
method add practical wisdom. Cannot 
a gracious personality eventually dom- 
inate them, and, in the process of for- 
mation, cannot absolute integrity and 
freedom from self-seeking and fairness 
toward employers as well as towards 
other employees so influence them that, 
if women's unions have come to stay, 
they shall be benignant in all their 
aspects ? 

Just in proportion to the nobility of 
the personality that forms any organiza- 
tion will it be of wide service. May 
women never fail to be true women, 
even in doing the work of men. Some- 
times there is too much insistence 
upon doing women's work in men's 
ways, when the fixed quantity is the 
work, not the men or the women.

In hand work as in bram work the best 
is wanted, be it that of men or of women. 
Neither man nor woman can gain by 
endeavoring to lay aside the differen- 
tiation which makes each, man or 



woman, and in doing one's work, as 
the man or as the woman, it will be 
found that the work best in itself is 
done. Thus personality helps even 
when organizations are formed. 



The Combination Stew of Amzi Bean 

By Helen Campbell 




ES," said Mr. Bean, seller 
of choice fish, oysters, and 
clams in a section of the city 
market, a city devoted to good eating 
and famed for the facilities it afforded 
in that direction. * * Folks do say there's 
something out of the common in my 
oyster stew. An' they say, too, there's 
only one other man in the whole stretch 
of stalls that knows to nigh a minute 
just how long a fish has been out o' 
water. There's club stewards, men 
so high and mighty you'd suppose they 
was head of the whole caboodle, an' 
that has to buy for epicures of the 
worst sort, an' they'll go by bigger 
stalls an' more show an' come straight 
to me. Same with oysters and clams 
or anything else wiUi a shell to it. 
They ask for mine first, and, if I haven't 
got enough, go away mad. I've got 
a shucker, too, that can't be beat, — 
more to an hour an' a cleaner job than 
any one I ever see. Knows fish most 
as good, an' has eyes as sharp as mine, 
(an' that's saying consid'able,) for there 
ain't any kind of a test as to eyes that 
I ain't ready to stand. Bom that 
way? No, sir. Bom a little, weak- 
eyed-with-red-rims yoimg one, that 
couldn't see anything straight. An' 
my tmcle Amzi, that owned a biig 
that mn between here and the Azores, 
he says to me one day: *Here, you 
youngster with eyes as red as a fancy 
duck's, you don't need to have any 
sech times with your eyes nor glasses, 
neither, long as you live, if you do 



the way I tell you. If you do, you'll 
come out with eyes like a hawk's and 
as fur-seein' as his. Wash 'em kind 
of gently, an' dry 'em same way. Then 
take long looks at the sun. Never 
mind if it hurts some. Look long as 
you can, three or four times a day, an' 
in between stretch 'em. Look fur as 
you can. Take the v^ furtherest 
thing between you an' the horizon, 
an' look an' look, an' try to see all there 
is of it, an' then shut 'em up an' rest 
'em.' 

' 'Well, I did. Got into the way of it 
at last, so it just did itself, an' it keeps 
right on, — no glasses an' next door 
to extra-power microscopes for the 
things I can see. But there was one 
day they served me a trick that I 
thought was going to spoil my reputa- 
tion. I don't know to this day just 
how it happened, but I do know how 
it come out, an' that's the main thing. 

* * You see I had a reg'lar set of cus- 
tomers by that time all callin' for 
*Bean stews.' Thought it funny, some 
of 'em. to label choice oysters that way, 
an' I let 'em, though at first it did kind 
of rile me just a mite. I'd filled that 
kind of an order one day, done to just 
the right-sized ruffle on the edges of 
some first-class ones as ever you see, 
an' set it down before Cap'n Jimmy, 
smacking his lips just at sight an' smell 
of it. He smacked *em agin as he eat, 
an' calls out to me : * I say, Amzi. What 
you done to this stew? There's an 
extra touch about it, an' I'd like to 



34a 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



know what.' And before the words were 
out of his mouth come one of his own 
sailors from the ship at the dock, and 
made for him. * Fight on board an* 
the devil to pay!* he says, an' Cap*n 
Jimmy ran like vdld fire, for he never 
had no such doings as that, an' it was 
some new sailor. It seemed a shame 
to throw that stew away, for you know, 
of cotu-se, an oyster's no good warmed 
over, an* I sat down to the table an' 
tasted it. *By George! There is an 
extra touch, sure enough,' I said to 
myself; an' I turned over the oysters to 
see if maybe it was a new kind slipped 
in. An' there, if you'll believe me, 
was two little *quahaugs,' the Rhode 
Island folks' calls 'em; hard-shell clams. 
How they got in there, goodness knows, 
but there they were. An' I says to 
myself, *If it's them that did it, they'U 
go into the next one, but we'll see.' 
So from that time dn I was days, you 
might say, making up my mind whether 
it was some change in seasoning, half 
a drop, quaybe, here or there or just 
them clams. Taste, you see, goes 
back on you oftener than your smell 
does, and I had to use both, — do every 
day of my life before I'm just certain. 
"But then, again, I'm careful as a 
druggist measuring out things. I see 
my wife every day just what I call 
shovelin' in seasonin' or spices, but 
somehow she manages to hit it, for she 
is a master cook. But I can't do it 
that way, an' I nearly went out" of 
my mind tryin' to be certain about 
that stew. An' at last, when I worried 
over it a week, I hit it again, — ^same 
smell, same taste, — an' if Cap'n Jimmy 
didn't come in jest as I laid down the 
spoon, an' said, 'You ain't goin' back 
on me again, you pesky stew, for I've 
got you down to the last grain of 
pepper.' ' 'Twon't be like the last 
one,' Cap'n Jimmy says, kind of 
solemn. 'I tell you, Bean, I could 
most *a 'cried being whisked away that 
day the way I was, but it wa'n't none 
too soon to straighten out that fight.' 



Then he took a taste, an' first I knew 
he up and gave me a slap on the back 
that nearly knocked me over. 'By 
the Lord, Harry,' he says, 'you've 
done it again. Bean! Did you know 
it?' I wasn't going to let him know 
how I'd worked over it, an' says, just 
kind of keerless, 'It's my business to 
know, ain't it ? * But he'd got to eatin' 
and didn't take no time answerin' 
back. 

" From that day to this it's always 
the same, an' I can't make 'em fast 
enough, an' that's all there is to it, — 
jest them two hard clams, little ones. 
One big one won't do it. Too rank, 
maybe. Two little ones every time, 
an' there you are. No milk in that 
stew. No, sir. Milk don't belong in 
any stew this establishment turns out. 
Women like it, an* some men-folks, 
but 'tain't my way. Haifa pint or a 
pint accordin' to what the man wants 
to pay for; but Cap'n Jimmy's was a 
pint, for he's hearty and wants cold slaw 
to match. Boil up the juice, a good 
lump of butter, an' season for your life. 
My eye tells me, but by measure it's 
half a teaspoonful of salt, a grain of 
cayenne, an' a touch of white pepper, 
never black, an' one boil-up all to- 
gether. Drop in the two clams an' give 
them the same, then your oysters, an' 
the second their ruffles curl a mite, to 
table with 'em! That's all. 

" No, it ain't all, either, for one day 
there come in here a reporter that had 
got hold of things somehow, an' he 
had his stew nice an' quiet, praisin' 
it up. So I told him the way, never 
suspectin', an' if he didn't have it in 
his paper come Sunday, nat'ral as 
could be, my red whiskers and all. 
Then it traveled, I suppose. Anyhow, 
somehow, somebody down in Kentucky 
made out he could beat me. An im- 
pudent cuss he must have been, for 
everybody knows oysters don't grow 
anywheres near Kentucky. But he'd 
been tryin' with canned things, an,' 
just to see if he was right, I went an' 



In Febraary

got same things be had to work with, 
but it wasn't worth shucks to anybody 
that had ever seen a live oyster. What 
he took was a half-pint bottle of clam 
broth and half a pint of oyster juice, 
an' put it in his chafing-dish with a 
big tablespoonful of good butter an' 
half a teaspoonful of paprika, an' gave 
it a boil-up, then put in his solid 
half-pint of oysters an' give 'em 
another, two drops - of tabasco sauce 
in the bottom of each bowl that he 
potu^ 'em into. Not so bad; but 
who'd take it, if he could have the 



real thing? . Not Amzi Bean or any- 
body that puts his legs imder one of 
his little tables. 

"Why don't I have a big place an' 
make money? Money's well enough, 
but it's the fim of the thing I'm after, 
an' the having the chance to see the 
folks eat it as if there wasn't another 
such in the world. An' there ain't. 
On that point I'm settled. If you 
ain't, you know, why you don't have 
to come again." 

'*But I am," said his hearer, and 
passed on with a sigh of content. 



In February 

By Grace Stone Field 

Sometimes in February there comes a warm, sweet day, 

A sort of foretaste of the spring, so long upon the way. 

A rapture thrills through all one's veins, as sap stirs in the trees; 

You think you hear the bluebirds singing days like these. 



Neighbors caU out cheery greeting: "Surely, 

it is spring!" 
"This will start the robins flitting northward 

on the wing." 
"Winter's backbone must be broken." "April's 

almost here." 
"There! You heard it? 'Twas a bluebird, 

just as clear." 

Winter gone? Why, he's just Faughing in his sleeve! 
Ev'ry year he plays the same old make-believe 
So be patient, wait a little, don't you fret. 
Spring is coming, surely coming, but — not yet. 



Well, it's still the same old story ev'ry single 
season. 

February's a deceiver, maybe that's the rea- 
son 

Else, when winter months were fixed, 

March and February mixed! 



Diet in its Relation to Childhood, Sickness, 

and Old Age 

By Mary D. Chambers 
Second Paper 

Other Noteworthy Physiological DilfFerences between 

Child and Adult 

Nervous System, — ^The digestive ap- call them so, and is less apt to be af- 
paratus in the child is more controlled fected by the brain. The advantage of 
by the vegetative centres, if one may this is that the emotions in a child are 



3^4 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



not so liable to affect digestion, the 
disadvantage that digestion seems in 
a measure to be left to itself, as when 
nerve control is lost by a hysterical 
woman, and the food is more apt to 
disagree. A fine fit of bad temper in 
the baby, vigorously expressed by 
bawling and kicking, will not result in 
acute dyspepsia, but, on the other 
hand, the nerves do not stimulate se- 
cretion, as in the adult, where the gus- 
tatory nerves stimulate salivary di- 
gestion. In older children a capricious 
and ''finical" appetite must often be 
catered to, if serious trouble regarding 
digestion and assimilation is to be 
avoided, while an adult of good sense 
can eat with profit the. wholesome 
though distasteful dish. In digestion, 
as in other things, the nerves are largely 
dependent on the will; and the will is 
a very curious thing. 

Sigmoid Flexure. — This S-shaped 
curve at the end of the descending colon, 
terminating in the rectum, is in the 
infant very large, being often nine 
inches Idng, or more than half the length 
of the large intestine. Hence con- 
stipation or obstruction should be 
avoided. This is another physiological 
argument for the use of milk, which is 
almost completely digested in the 
stomach, only a very small residue 
being transmitted to the intestine. 

Size of Liver. — The liver in the infant 
is very large, and pushes the stomach 
back, so that this lies, as mentioned in 
last paper, less transversely than in the 
adult. To this position of the stomach, 
as well as to the fact that during the 
early months of life the cardiac orifice 
of that organ opens readily, while the 
pyloric orifice may be said to be not 
yet accustomed to opening with ease, 
is due the tendency to vomit on the 
part of the infant on the smallest 
provocation. A physician of great re- 
pute declares that this easy vomiting is 
an advantage, since it is a benefit to 
the child that it is unable to ' 'enter into 
long discussions with its food." 



Indications whether Food agrees 

with Child 

The child sleeps after nursing or 
rests quietly. 

The bowels move regularly, three or 
four times in twenty-four hours for 
the first week of life, then two or three 
times. 

The gain in weight should be steady, 
and the minimum weekly increase 
should equal four ounces during the first 
six months. The child should double 
its weight in five or six months and 
treble it in a year. 

Time, etc., of Feeding 

Regularity in feeding is highly to be 
recommended, and the time allowed 
for each feeding should by no means 
be hurried or curtailed. Fifteen to 
twenty minutes should be allowed for 
each "meal." 

Never play with the baby after 
feeding. It is apt to cause vomiting 
and indigestion.. It is really better not 
to play with the baby under four 
months. It is apt to be made nervous 
and irritable. The brain at this time 
is very delicate in structure, and is 
growing rapidly. Over-stimulation is 
bad. 

Results of Improper Feeding 

Abnormal vomiting, in which the 
milk is rejected unchanged or in tough, 
stringy masses. 

Diarrhoea, watery, yellow passages, 
due to excess of peristalsis. When the 
stools are watery, colorless, and very 
frequent, this condition may indicate 
the beginning of cholera infantum. 

Constipation. 

Fretfulness, irregular and disturbed 
sleep, or profuse sweating about the 
head. 

Failure to gain in weight. 

Habitual colic. 

Adaptation of Food to Weather and 
Other Conditions 
Heat affects the nerves of the skin, 



Diet in its Relation to Childhood, Sickness, and Old Age 325 



and thus by reflex action modifies the 
internal temperature, and this modi- 
fication affects the nutritive processes. 

Avoid over-feeding. In excessively 
hot weather each meal can be di- 
minished by at least one- third, water 
being used to make up the deficiency. 
Water may be given freely between 
meals; and for infants and young chil- 
dren it is safer to boil it. 

The child should be bathed fre- 
quently. 

Food in warm weather is apt to 
turn slightly sour, and should be tested 
with litmus paper. 

For frequent vomiting soon after 
feeding reduce the quantity of food. 
For regurgitation of sour masses an 
hour or more after feeding the fats 
should be reduced, sometimes also the 
proteids. 

For habitual colic diminish the pro- 
teids. 

For obstinate constipation increase 
the fat or add a little sugar to the 
feedings or administer a little orange 
juice. 

For failure to gain in weight, without 
special signs of indigestion, increase 
the amount of each feeding or increase 
the proportions of the nutrients; i.e., 
proteid, fat, and carbohydrate in the 

t. 



Fo 



oods Other than Milk during First 

Year 

Time to add, not before appearance 
of first teeth. 

At five or six months oatmeal water 
or barley water may be used to dilute 
the food, one-half to one-third the 
volume of the food, or a tablespoonful 
of oatmeal or barley gruel, well strained 
and slightly sweetened, may be given 
before nursing, or a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of oatmeal or barley jelly may 
be added to each feeding. 

At six months a delicate infant is 
often helped by a little beef tea once a 
day, either alone or mixed with other 
food. 



At ten or twelve months, in a similar 
case, beef juice may be used, — a table- 
spoonful before the mid-day meal, or, 
as maximum quantity for a short time, 
two or three teaspoonfuls added to 
each feeding. At this age orange * juice 
carefully strained through muslin may 
be given for constipation, — one to two 
tablespoonfuls once a day, an hour be- 
fore feeding. The use of bread may 
begin at twelve months old. 

Since the personal idiosyncrasy in 
babies is quite as diverse as in adults, 
no diet prescription is found suitable 
for all cases, and only the broadest 
rules can be laid down. In general, it 
may be noted that the youmg of any 
vertebrata are not naturally nourished 
on vegetable food alone. The digestive 
organs are first prepare for dealing 
with proteid food. Birds provide 
worms or insects for their young. All 
mammals suckle theirs. Milk, then, in 
some form, is plainly designed, as noted 
in the last paper, to form the basis of 
the diet, and artificial foods are valu- 
able only as they approximate milk in 
composition or are adapted to special 
pathological conditions. 

« 

Normal Changes during First 

Year 

The infant should be able to hold up 
its head at three or four months old, 
and its body, in sitting erect, at seven 
or eight months. The voice of parents 
is usually recognized at three and one- 
half months, and the child should begin 
to walk and talk by twelve months. 
At two months the posterior fontanelle 
closes, while the anterior fontanelle 
grows larger up to six months, the 
growth of the brain being more rapid 
than the process of ossification. After 
six months it grows constantly smaller, 
and by the fifteenth or eighteenth 
month it should be closed. 

Idiosyncrasies of Infancy 
Sleep. — Under six months a child 



316 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



should sleep nearly nine-tenths of the 
time, after that, to the age of one year, 
nearly three-fourths of the time. 

Crying. — Besides cryiag from hunger, 
pail), or temper, a child cries naturally 
to expand the lungs. A loud, strong 
cry, for fifteen or twenty minutes a day, 



is not to be deplored : it is good exercise 
for the baby. 

Drooling. — Up to the third month 
the mouth is dry. Afterwards, when 
the secretion of saliva increases, the 
child does not know what to do with it. 
Hence it is not all swallowed. 



Cooking in a Lumber Camp 

By C. B. Smith 



IN the lumber camp every man earns 
his wages. One cook with a 
helper is considered sufficient to do 
all the cooking, table waiting, and dish- 
washing for a crew of forty men, and 
keep the camp clean. For a crew of 
eighty men a cook, assistant, and in- 
side chore-boy suffice. The wages 
range from $25 to $35 per month for the 
head cook of a crew of twenty-five to 
thirty-five men, and may go up as high 
as $50 per month for a crew of seventy 
to eighty men. The assistant gets $24 
to S30, and the chore-boy about $18 
per month. The cook's work begins at 
about 4.30 in the morning, and ends 
about 8.30 at night. 

The food supplied the men is plain, 
but there is an abundance of it. When 
the camp is 30 to 40 miles from a rail- 
road, corned beef and salt pork are 
practically the only meat supplied, 
except in the fall, when the camp himter 
may get a few deer. Occasionally 
through the winter fresh beef and 
pork may be supplied. Salt meats, 
sufficiently freshened and thoroughly 
cooked, are exceedingly appetizing and 
palatable, and the entire absence of 
fresh meat for a period of six months 
is scarcely noticed by the men working 
daily in the cold bracing air of the pine 
woods. 

Breakfast. — In the lumber camp of 
Northern Michigan the breakfast horn 
blows at six o'clock. The men silently 
file into the cook camp, and take their 



places on benches at tables covered 
with oil cloth. The dishes may be 
either tin or earthenware. 

In a well-provided camp the break- 
fast consists of warmed-up potatoes, 
fried salt pork, hash, cold sliced 
corned beef and boiled pork, baked 
beans, compote, bread, johnny cake, 
hot biscuit or buns, ginger snaps, white 
cookies, doughnuts, fruit cake, molasses, 
pickles, butter, and tea. Sometimes 
coffee is furnished, but this is rarely 
the case. Pie may also be served. 

During the meal, there is absolute 
silence other than the rattling of knife, 
fork, and spoon on the dishes. What 
conversation there may be is done in 
a low tone. Laughing and loud talking 
are not considered good form. Aj^ 
Signs of it bring black looks from fl& 
foreman, and still blacker ones from the 
cook. The cook has suspicions that 
sport is being made of the food. I have 
seen men discharged for it, and cooks 
pack their "turkey" and leave without 
an hour's notice because the foreman 
permitted it. 

When hauling to the banking ground 
begins in earnest, the teamsters are the 
first to enter the door for breakfast. 
Not a word is wasted in talk, and the 
masterful way in which they dispose of 
a breakfast would put to shame the 
champion business man at a lunch 
counter. Within three minutes after 
the men sit down, the teamsters will 
begin to get up and go out. This haste 



Cooking in a Lumber Camp 



3^7 



is due to the fact that the first man to 
the woods in the morning is the first 
one to get through work in the after- 
noon. Within fifteen minutes after 
the horn blows for breakfast, the whole 
crew will have eaten, and within twenty 
minutes at most breakfast is entirely 
over. There may be two exceptions 
in camp, — ^the clerk and the scaler. 
These represent the book-taught, 
aristocratic portion of the camp, and 
generally get into breakfast about the 
time the last man is going out, much to 
the annoyance of the cook, who must 
bring on a new supply of warm victuals 
and is hindered in clearing up the table. 
The MorningWork, — ^At seven o'clock 
the boiler of corned beef and salt pork 
is put on to cook. This will be fresh- 
ened twice before noon. The morning 
routine is about as follows: The 
tables are cleared, and all the dishes 
washed. The tables are washed off 
with soap and water, and the floor 
swept all over. With a crew of forty 
men the chief cook takes time to wipe 
the dishes, after which he goes to baking 
and the assistant gets the vegetables 
ready for dinner, sets the table, etc. 

With a crew of eighty men the head 
cook will give all his attention to mak- 
ing pastry, except at meal-time, when 
he will help dish up and wait on table. 
With this crew a barrel of flour will be 
rolled in each morning, and the empty 
barrel out each night. During the 
forenoon, bread, pies, and cookies will 
be made. After the crust is mixed up 
and the filling is made, a lively cook will 
make and bake 30 to 40 pies in an hour. 
Pies, — Fresh pies are expected every 
day for dinner. They are made out 
of evaporated fruits, especially apples, 
but also of prunes, English currants, 
and occasionally of raisins. Prepared 
mincemeat is supplied also. About 
once a week vinegar pies are made. 
These are prepared by boiling together 
vinegar, sugar, and water, seasoning 
with butter and spices, and thickening 
with flour. These pies are made with 



a bottom crust and open lattice-work 
top, after the manner of cranberry pies. 
These pies make a change, and, if not 
made too often, are relished by the 
men. 

Dinner, — Dinner comes promptly at 
twelve o'clock. At this meal there will 
be boiled or mashed potatoes, baked 
beans, hot boiled beef and pork, two 
or three vegetables, and some kind of 
dressing, pudding or boiled rice. Be- 
sides such fresh vegetables as cabbage, 
turnips, onions, beets, and carrots, 
canned vegetables, like com, peas, toma- 
toes, and green beans, are quite generally 
furnished by the lumber companies. 

Dishing up for a big crew begins 
five minutes before twelve, and is the 
busiest time of the day. Everjrthing 
is taken up piping hot and put on the 
table in large-sized vegetable dishes. 
All cups are filled with tea, and small 
pots holding twelve or fifteen cups, 
each, are placed on the table, so that 
the men can help themselves. The 
waiters see that every vegetable dish, 
bread plate, and teapot is kept filled 
during the entire meal. It takes a 
trained eye to glance along a table and 
see every empty dish. 

Dinner is perhaps the heartiest meal 
of the day, though all are hearty 
enough for the cook. The appetites 
of the men vary greatly from month 
to month. Beginning in the fall, the 
men eat ravenously until about Christ- 
mas. At every meal all the dishes 
will be cleaned, and it seems almost 
impossible to satisfy the men's appe- 
tites. From January until the camp 
breaks up in March it is one-fourth to 
one-third easier to cook for the same 
crew tlian in the fall, providing the 
cook each day loads his table with the 
et ceteras, like cake, pie, cookies, pud- 
dings, etc. The men seem to crave 
these sweet things, and the lumber 
companies are usually willing to supply 
them, considering sugar is cheap, and as 
effective a food as they can give them.

NOW, THEN, ALL TOGETHER 

WE, inhabitants of the. United 
States, have had a very good 
year. Crops were tremen- 
dous. The mines produced three or 
four hundred millions of wealth. Rail- 
road earnings exceeded two and a 
quarter billion dollars. More impor- 
tant still, the new national aspiration 
for justice gathered force; got itself 
expressed in the freight-rate bill, meat 
inspection, the New York insurance 
laws ; is now a force that every intelli- 
gent politician recognizes, and which 
will make itself increasingly felt in

ENTHUSL\STIC LIVING 

PRESIDENT JORDAN, of Stan- 
ford University, has written a 
book on ''Life's Enthusiasms." 
He appeals for greater enthusiasm in 
living, and exhorts us all * *to do things 
because we love them, to love things 
because we do them, to keep the eyes 
open, the heart warm, and the pulse 
swift as we move across the field of 
life." He quotes Robert Louis Ste- 
venson's recipe for joyousness,— * *to 
take the old world by the hand and 
frolic with it." 

Herein, it seems, lies the secret of 
successful living as it appears to many 
thoughtful men and women of to-day.

The old-time idea of being in the 
world and yet not a part of it has been 
the cause of untold evil. It is no 
longer in keeping with current thought. 
A lively interest in everything we do" 
is the sure way to prosperity. The 
cheerful life is the only life worth living. 
And how many things there are in the 
world that are worthy of our interest I 
lavished on every hand are material 
and intellectual products of wondrous 
attraction. Since Goldsmith wrote the 
• 'Vicar of Wakefield'' and Bos well re- 
ported the after-dinner talk of Dr. 
Johnson, many interesting events have 
happened. The world has made prog- 
ress. The outlook on life has enlarged. 

In the cultivation of a fondness of 
nattu-e and all it holds, of which our- 
selves are but a part, Ues the true 
source of all earnest, cheerful Uving. 
Our interest and consequent affection 
are in objects with which we have come 
in contact. 

* 'Old as the world is, let it be always 
new to us as we are new to it. Let it 
be every morning made afresh by Him 
-who 'instantly and constantly reneweth 
the work of creation.' Let 'the bit of 
green sod under your feet be the sweet- 
est to you in this world, in any world.' 
Half the joy of life is in Uttle things 
taken on the run.. Let us run, if we 
must, — even the sands do that, — ^but 
let us keep our hearts young and our 
eyes open, that nothing worth our while 
shall escape us. And everything is 
w^orth our while, if we only grasp it and 
its significance. As we grow older, it 
becomes harder to do this. A grown 
man sees nothing he was not ready to 
see in his youth. So long as enthusi- 
asm lasts, so long is youth still with 



us.

SUCCESS 

A KANSAS woman has been 
awarded a prize of $250 by a 
Boston firm for the best answer 
to the question, "What constitutes 
success?" 



She wrote: "He has achieved suc- 
cess who has lived well, laughed often, 
and loved much; who has gained the 
respect of intelligent men and the love 
of little children; who has filled his 
niche and accomplished his task; who 
has left the world better than he foimd 
it, whether by an improved pogpy, a 
perfect poem, or a rescued soul; who 
has never lacked appreciation of earth's 
beauty or failed to express it ; who has 
always looked for the best in others and 
given the best he had; whose life was 
an inspiration, whose memory a bene- 
diction." 

This is not bad, — rather it is good, 
and worthy of thoughtful attention. 
To be sure, not much is said here about 
gold and silver, fame or position. Any- 
how, these are mere concomitants of 
the successful life. The question for 
each of us to determine is. Have we the 
elements requisite to achieve really true 
success? Does our own prosperity 
and happiness tend in no wise to take 
from, but ever add to, the happiness of 
others ? 

THE TRUE SPIRIT 

"f I "^HE best sign of the times," 
I says Harper's Weekly, "is 
M the wide-spread discontent. 
Ever)rwhere men are demanding new 
conditions. Millionaires wear their 
gains imeasily, and seek refuge in alms- 
giving and charities. Few people, com- 
paratively, are elementary enough to 
sit satisfied with a comfortable personal 
fate. George Eliot's outcry, *I would 
not take a heaven haunted by shrieks 
of some one's far-off hell,' is no longer 
so personal a standpoint. The world 
is filling fast with folk who refuse to be 
satisfied with comfort and refinement 
and ease, except in so far as they can 
pass on the possibility of such living 
to others. Not a creed about himself, 
not articles of belief, however useful 
as instruments these things may be at 
times, were what Christ was bom to 
teach. These are nothing but the para-

phemalia of a human institution, — sl 
human institution that has grown 
blunderingly, failing only somewhat 
less than it has succeeded. Christ 
added to the sum of the great ethical 
teachings of the ages the love of 
man." 

The true spirit is that of the age in 
which we live, and it is indicated by 
the best thought of the best minds. 
We study other times and other ages 
to compare them with our own, to mark 
the changes, improvements, — in short, 
the progress that has been made from 
time to time. Our chief duty is to 
keep in touch with the spirit of the 
times and strive earnestly for the best. 
On other conditions than these, as 
children say, we will not play. 



FOREST RESERVATION 

A CCORDING to press reports the 
/\ bill for the White Moimtain and 
^ ]m.^^^ Appalachian forest reserves 
has passed the Senate without opposi- 
tion, and has been imanimously re- 
ported for passage by a House Com- 
mittee. The President has recom- 
mended it, and there is now no ques- 
tion of its passage by the House, if it 
could be brought before that body. This 
depends on the favor of the Committee 
on Rules. Strange and incomprehen- 
sible feature of our national legislation 1 

We can see no reason why our Con- 
gress should delay for one day the pas- 
sage of this measure* It concerns the 
interests of a large part of the land. 
The prosperity of the coimtry east of 
the AUeghanies is at stake. The preser- 
vation of mountain forests and valu- 
able water supply and power is de- 
pendent on their perpetual safety from 
the ravages of the unrestrained lumber 
interests. The attractiveness and 
healthfulness of large sections are in- 
volved. In comparison with all other 
interests the lumbering interests, in- 
cluding the producers of wood pulp 



and other products of forest destruc- 
tion are scarcely worthy of considera- 
tion. The few people thus engaged 
in stripping our forests are injuring 
alike themselves and their neighbors. 
Let us have speedy relief from ruthless 
waste in forest destruction. 

*'TU fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, 
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay." 



MAJOR HENRY L. HIGGIN- 
SON, the financier (than 
whom Boston has no more 
disinterested or public-spirited citizen) 
made a statement recently which is 
very much to the point. "Many men," 
he said, "have grown fat and lazy, and 
have thought of nothing but their 
purses, automobiles, and good dinners, 
and in their way they are just as bad 
citizens as the loafers in the street who 
do not care to do a day s work. A 
lot of successful men have been push- 
ing their success to a dangerous point, 
and have been flaunting it in the eyes 
of the public. It is the old story about 
a larger and wider philosophy and re- 
ligion which have got to come to the 
front and choke the nonsense put out 
by the demagogues. * To-day is the 
day to heed the signal."'

us what they want to find in the maga- 
zine ! We shall try to please them.

Dear Madam, — Enclosed find $1 for

Boned Loin of Lamb 
Have the marketman remove the 
bones and cut the flank end from a loin 
of Iamb. The flank with the bones can 
be used for lamb stew 
or rag ut (highly sea- 
soned stew), or it 
may be boiled or 
steamed for a dish of . 
hash. The boned loin 
makes an easily 
carved roast, from 
which about a dozen 
slices may be cut, or 
it may be cut before 
cooking into chops. 
The chops, pressed 
into rounds and 
fastened with wooden toothpicks, give 
a pleasing change from the ordinary 
chop with bone. They may be broiled 
over the coals, pan-broiled, cooked in 
a casserole, or fried in deep fat after 
being " egged -and-crumbed." 

Broiled Medallions of Lamb with 
Lima Bean Puree 
Prepare the medallions from a boned 
loin, as above, or buy the chops, re- 
move the bones, and press the meat into 
the desired shape. Prepare a pint or 
more of the pur^. Of this make little 
rounds upon which the cooked chops 
may be disposed. Pipe 
purte around the meat, 
thus setting it in a nest. 
Serve very hot, 

Lima Bean Puree 
Let a cup and a half of 
dried Lima beans stand

cook in boiling- water. Let 
cook until tender, supply- 
ing water (boiling) as 
needed, and adding a tea- 
spoonful of salt during the last of the 
cooking. The beans will require about 
three hours' cooking at a gentle simmer. 



When the water has evaporated and 
the beans are tender, with a pestle press 
them through a pur4e sieve. Add 
nearly one-fourth a cup of butter, a

little hot cream, and salt as needed. 
A teaspoonful of onion juice, a table- 
spoonful of fine-chopped parsley, and 
paprika may be added at discretion. 
The flavor of onion is always good 
with beans. Beat the mixture until 
light, when it is ready to use. Serve 
very hot.

then looks dry, add more oil and lemon 
juice, and, when all the ingredients are 
evenly blended, turn into a bowl lined 
with well washed-and-dried lettuce 
leaves. Serve with bread and butter at 
luncheon or supper. ' Cream cheese is 
good with the dish. 

Chafing-dish Chicken, King Style 

Melt four tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
chafing-dish. Add half a green pepper, 
chopped fine, and cook three or four 
minutes without allowing the butter to 
brown. Add two level tablespoonfuls of 
flour and half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and cook until frothy. Then add one 
pint of cream, and stir until the sauce 
thickens. Set over hot water, and add 
half a cup of button mushrooms, cut in 
halves, and two and one-half cups of 
cooked chicken, cut in cubes, also 
paprika, if desired, and serve on toast. 

Canned Com Timbales 

Chop fine about half a can of com, 
and press enough through a sieve to fill 
a cup. Beat four eggs until whites and 



yolks are well mixed. Add two table- 
spoonfuls of green or red pepper (fresh), 
chopped fine, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a dash of paprika, ten or fifteen drops of 
onion juice, and one cup and a fourth of 
rich milk. Bake in buttered moulds set 
on many folds of paper and surrounded 
with boiling water. 

Veal CoUops en Casserole 

Have slices of veal from the leg three- 
fourths an inch thick. Cut one pound 
and a half of such veal into cubes. 
Draw into each cube two lardoons of fat 
salt pork. Melt one-fourth a cup of 
butter in a frying-pan, and in it saut6 
the meat over a quick fire, to brown it 
lightly. Add boiling water or white 
stock tQ cover the meat. Turn it into a 
casserole, cover, and let cook in the oven 
about an hour and a half. When the 
meat has been cooking about an hour, 
saut6 eight mushroom caps in a little 
melted butter. Saute also the stems 
and peelings of the mushrooms and 
two shiallots(or a sUce of onion), chopped 
fine. Sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls 
of flour, stir until blended, then add half 
a cup of sherry and half a cup of stock. 
Stir until boiling, then stir the whole 
into the casserole. Add also salt and 
pepper as needed. Cover close, and 
let cook slowly in the oven until the 
meat is very tender. It will probably 
take about half an hour. Serve from 
the casserole. The sherry may be 
omitted and cream used in its place. 

Brussels Sprouts, Buttered 

Pick over a quart of sprouts, discard- 
ing yellow or worm-eaten leayes, cover 
with a quart of cold water in which a 
tablespoonful of salt has been dissolved, 
and let stand for an hour or more. 
Skim out the sprouts, and set to cook in 
a saucepan of boiling, salted water. 
Cook at the simmering-point and in an 
uncovered vessel about thirty minutes. 
When done, drain in a colander, and 
shake them in a hot dish with salt and 
about one-third a cup of butter.

By Janet M. Hill 
Common and Unhygienic Errors in Eating 

If we ate freety of greens in salads and fresh vegetables, we should not need blood purifiers 
nor quiniDe : fniit replaces liver pills, and otive oil is more eadly Bssioiilated than cod liver oil. — 
Adelaide Keen. 

The palate is as capable and almost as worthy of cultivation as the eye and ear. — Franca- 
ItUi. 

Bad cooldng is at the root of many divorces, and divorces are more numerous here [America] 
than abroad. — Adelaide Keen, 



IT is rare to find any one who eats 
hygienicaliy. Few know how to 
eat properly, and of these still 
fewer live up to their knowledge. 
Probably the most common errors in 
eating are eating too fast, eating too 
much in quantity or too little in va- 
riety, and the non-avoidance of special 
articles of food that are known to dis- 
agree with us individually. 

It is not easy to drag one's self out of 
bed on cold winter mornings before 
it is scarcely light, but in reality plenty 
of time in which to eat breakfast pays, 
before the day is done, a larger divi- 
dend of comfort than almost any- 
thing else. Eating with one eye on 
the clock does not foster deUberation 
in eating. But some one remarks: 
"Altogether too much is said about 
eating slowly. I am sure there is an 
old adage the substance of which is, 
'Watch a man eat, and you will know 
how he works,* " It is true energy is 
a first essential in eating as in working, 
but energetic chewing must be con- 
tinued until the food, espedally cereals, 
bread, and other starchy articles, has 
been turned over and over in the 



mouth, and thoroughly permeated 
with the digestive fluids, which are 
found nowhere else save in the mouth, 
if digestion is to be complete. Then, 
too, mastication is good for the teeth. 
Our remote ancestors had good teeth. 
They exercised them from infancy on 
food from which the bone-making ele- 
ments had not been eliminated. 

Most Americans do not Uke crusty, 
flinty bread; i.e., French bread baked 
in small loaves, and rolls baked apart 
one from another, to insure a crusty 
exterior. Their preference is for the 
large loaf, aboimding in a soft, spongy 
crumb. The latter may be good bread 
(it often is) but it does not compel 
mastication, and is swallowed before 
the sweet flavor of the grain has been 
discovered, and, what is of vasUy 
more importance, before digestion, 
which precedes nutrition, is assured. 

An evil, resultant of haste in swallow- 
ing food, is the drinking of too much 
fluid with the meals. Food property 
moistened with the digestive fluids of 
the mouth can be swallowed without 
copious draughts of water or other 
liquid. Water is needed in the econ- 



344 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



omy of the system, but the quantity 
taken at meals should be very Umited. 
Especially too much cannot be said 
against the practice of drinking ice 
water at meals. Cold depresses the 
flow of saliva and delays stomach di- 
gestion until heat can be drawn from 
the body to bring the ingested food 
to the proper temperature for the con- 
tinuation of the process. Who can 
estimate the limit of the evils engen- 
dered in the stomach by such retarded 
digestion? Let us not forget, also, 
that freezing does not make impure 
water pure. 

This cooling of the contents of the 
stomach is a strong argument against 
frozen desserts, but these may be eaten 
so slowly that, in health, neither bodily 
temperature nor that of the ingested 
food be reduced abnormally. 

Tea and coffee are mild stimulants^ 
and as such have a certain value for 
those past middle Ufe. But they must 
be properly made, and taken in mod- 
eration. The half-cup of strong coffee, 
taken at the close of a meal and slowly 
sipped is a positive aid to digestion, 
while two cups of weak tea or coffee, 
sweetened and creamed, taken with 
the meal, will eventually bring on dys- 
pepsia. Small tea-rooms have become 
popular eating-places, because in them 
it is possible to get a cup of tea, fra- 
grant and free from the tannin that 
kills. Often business men, who enjoy 
a hearty meal at mid-day, will forego 
this indulgence, and take the lighter 
dishes prepared at a tea-room, that 
they may have with the meal a ''good 
cup of tea." Tea made in a large re- 
ceptacle, to be drawn from at need, is 
all right, if the bag of tea leaves be re- 
moved when the fragrance and essential 
oil have been withdrawn and before the 
deleterious tannin has been extracted. 

The idea of restricting the quantity 
of liquid partaken at meals is not new, 
but at present it has had a strong 
impetus from the attitude of the French 
towards soup. Prance was the country 



in which soup originated, and dinner, 
and even breakfast in some localities, 
has long been considered impossible 
without bouillon, consommd, or pot-au- 
feu, but now it is France herself that 
is crying, **Away with the soup!" 

Do not misunderstand. We are not 
decrying the proper use of liquids, but 
simply their use at the wrong time, 
Many a man or woman in middle life 
is spare, nervous, irritable, and chroni- 
cally feverish simply because they do 
not drink enough water. Let them 
take water freely, at the proper time, 
and they will doubtless improve in 
flesh and health. 

On no subject are we as conserva- 
tive as on that of food. How few eat 
olives, olive oil, grape-fruit, or cooked 
bananas I Listen to any provider for 
a family, large or small, when the sub- 
ject of "what to eat" is tmder discus- 
sion. Potatoes and lettuce, perhaps, 
are the only vegetables of which the 
whole family will eat. Green beans, 
spinach, cooked celery, tomatoes, 
squash, turnips, apples, macaroni, 
rice, and foods that make for bulk 
and waste are included in the bills of 
fare of the minority. Pish, even when 
fresh, is tabooed, and mutton and lamb 
are not appreciated. Beef, chicken, 
and eggs with bread comprise the 
bulk of the diet in too many families. 
Then there are those who go to the 
other extreme, and live on pie, cake, 
doughnuts, or starch and sugar in 
manifold forms. None of all these 
people eat properly. Food, varied 
from day to day, need cost no more 
than a repetition of the same articles. 
A variety of seasonable food prepared 
in various ways makes for health, and 
every one at the family table of suitable 
age should partake of all the dishes 
supplied, provided they do not posi- 
tively disagree with him. 

One may eat to advantage, occa- 
sionally, even of articles of food that 
the stomach would not tolerate day 
after day. Pleasurable surprise, either

in tlie food itself or in the manner in 
wliich it is presented, as also cheerful 
conversation at table, act as strong 
tonics on digestion. 

It is not always some special variety 
of food that we must avoid. Quite as 
often it is some particular mode of 
preparation or haphazard cooking that 
is at fault. Truly they who do the 
cooking hold the destiny of the world 
in their hands. Let all who cook note 
the following sentiment: — 

"There are three kinds of cooking, — 
negative, neutral, and positive. The 
first is no cooking at all. It is only 
spoiling good material. It is simply 
jabbing wildly at a delicate duty. The 
neutral sort is the kind where a person 
eats and doesn't know it, — just swallows 



and goes. No sentiment, no beauty, 
no delight in it. The third is where the 
light of the mind and the grace of the 
heart join in the delicate mingling of 
the material, and touch this and that 
feature of the process with the lovely 
vision of the sculptor who rounds the 
white muscle of Venus' shoulder, or of 
the artist who blends in a flower the 
tints of another world." 

N0T8. — In our March number the season- 
able 'recipes will lie largely for dishes cooked 
in pottery or in the serving-dish. In place 
of the After Breakfast Chat will be the first 
of a series of ten lessons in elementary cooking, 
in which the dishes suggested may be utilized 
at the tables of the pupils. A series of ques- 
tions will accompany the lessons, and answers 
to the same forwarded to the editor will be 
corrected and returned. — Editor.

Can she make a fine soufiI6, 
This dear girl you wed to-day? 
Can she make a fine souffle? 

(Tell me true.) 

Nay; but she can make my bread, 

Finest biscuits, too, instead; 

And, if I am well content, why not you ? 

Can she make a salad cream

Can she make a salad cream?

No: but she can cook a steak

And they taste just as my mother's used to do. 

Can she freeze a caf^ mousse 
Or a plombi^e produce? 
Can she freeze a cafd mousse? 

(Tell me true.) 

Ah! I'm sure that she cannot; 
Yet there comes a happy thought, — 
She can learn what's really worth her while to 
do. 



Ginger 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



OUR common spices suggest 
world history, but we seldom 
think of it. Spices from the 
East were once costly offerings sent by 
special messengers long distances to 
kings and dignitaries. The conquest 
of India was brought about by hardy 



mariners pushing 
East to trade for

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



and in Japan the young shoots or roots 
are eaten with boiled fish or pickled in 
plum vinegar. The roots or claw-like 
rhizomes are used for the well-known 
preserve once brought to us in blue 
and white ware better than that 
in use to-day. The Chinese are begin- 
ning to export fruit in tin cans like oiu- 
own from Hong Kong and Canton. Be- 
side many unfamiliar kinds, one can 
find pickled ginger, and garlic and gin- 
ger pickled together, and called Cutow. 

Crystalized ginger and the dryer 
stem ginger come in tin boxes. Either 
of these with crackers affords a pleas- 
ant little repast at bedtime or when 
traveling. Ginger candy made in clear, 
hard tablets is nice for a picnic or after 
an injudicious use of fruit or ice water 
in summer. Jamaica ginger is a fam- 
ily remedy. Crfeme de gengembre is 
a fine brandy cordial for sale at fancy 
grocers and wine dealers. Ginger tea, 
well made, is comforting and not to be 
despised. Cook the root or ground 
ginger in boiling water until a strong 
infusion is made. Then strain and 
sweeten, adding a little cream. 

As for ginger in general cookery, 
we all know what crisp, home-made 
ginger-snaps are. BoUing the molasses 
is the secret of their perfection. Nice, 
tender, dark, old-fashioned molasses 
gingerbread makes a simple dessert 
or Itmcheon dish, if a tablespoonful 
of whipped cream be put on each square. 
Of course, it must be fresh-baked, 
and not cold. Ginger dessert cakes 
are rich sugar jumbles made hot with 
the best of white ginger. 

Ginger pudding is made with pre- 
served ginger in place of citron, raisins, 
etc., and the syrup is used for the 
sauce. Preserved ginger is also used 
in ice-cream, also with tomato, lemon, 
and maraschino for a frozen punch 
to be served between meat or game 
and salad courses at dinner. Pre- 
served ginger, or the fresh or dried 
root, is used with pear and watermelon 
preserve, and it greatly improves cu- 



cumber pickles. A little ginger should 
be added to macaroni or noodle soup, 
to remove any pasty taste. In cook- 
ing veal, follow the German method 
of rubbing cutlets with ginger some 
little time before using. A roast of 
veal is likewise improved by it. 

Mr. F. B. Kilmer, of New Brunswick, 
N.J., who is an authority on tropical 
plants valuable for food and medi- 
cine, says that Jamaica has probably 
twenty-five to fifty thousand inhabi- 
tants almost entirely dependent on 
the ginger crop for ready money es- 
sential to maintain their existence. 
They are the Quashies, a title given 
to the snuff-colored and brown people 
there as distinct from the blacks. 

Large fields of ginger are rare. The 
plant is grown in little plots and beds 
here and there, alongside of pineapples 
and other fruits, amid a tangle of bush 
or weeds. The planting is done in 
March or April by placing pieces of the 
root, each containing an eye or embr>'o, 
in holes or trenches, like potatoes. 
With plenty of sunshine and rain the 
plant soon reaches a height of five 
feet, and with its cone-topped flower- 
ing stems is attractive and showy. 
Shortly after blooming the stalk 
withers, and then the roots can be 
harvested. From December or Janu- 
ary to March they are twisted out of 
the ground with a fork, using great 
care so as not to injure the roots. 
The fibres and soil which adhere must 
be removed quickly, else the ginger 
will not be white, neither can it remain 
in heaps, else it will mould. It is 
thrown into water and peeled by 
hand. 

Instead of "a husking bee" in 
Jamaica, they have a peeling match. 
Mr. Kilmer thus describes a ginger 
peelers' dance. "It was my priv- 
ilege and a part of my studies to be 
present at one of these peculiar har- 
vest home gatherings in Ginger I<and. 
I was given a point of vantage over- 
looking the dancing-hall, which on

this occasion was the cement floor of 
the barbecue, as the drying place of 
the ginger is called. The light of a 
few sickly lanterns, a smoky torch, and 
the hot glare of the tropical moon 
gleamed on the dusky men and maiden 
ginger-peelers. Their dresses were 
marvels in color, the men in sombre 
black, except for white vests and 
rainbow sashes. Against the dark- 
skinned forms of the gentler sex were 
brilliant reds, greens, and blues. 
Their skirts stood out balloon-like, 
stiflF with cassava starch. Trinkets 
of silver and gold were heavy and 
plentiful. They danced to the music 
of squeaky accordions, clapping of 
hands, and the plaintive, wailing, 
but musical voices of the on-lookers. 
There was plenty of noise, — plenty of 
ginger in that dance. The native 
'Spiritus saccharum Jamacaiensis' was 
dispensed freely, but I have seen 
much less orderly merry-makings in 
our own land of culture, and in all 
that excited, hot-blooded crowd not 
one was drunk or committed any 
flagrant breach of propriety. Past 
midnight I lay down on the only bed 
that the hut of my Quashie host af- 
forded. At intervals I awoke, to find 
that the ginger dance was still on. 
When the first rays of light came 
over the blue mountain peak, there on 
the bed, imder the bed, sprawled in 
heaps over the floor, were the ex- 
hausted dancers, fast asleep. But be- 
fore the sun rays had entered the cabin 
they had bathed their bodies in the 
cool spring, taken a cup of coffee, and 
were fresh for their day's work." 

After the ginger is peeled, it is washed 
again, and then dried in the sun on the 
stone and cemented floor of the * 'bar- 
becue." The poorer planters have 
only rough tables, made saw-buck 
fashion and topped with boards or 
palm and banana leaves, or, plainer 
stilly only a few palm leaves spread 



on the ground. Careful handlers turn 
the ginger at mid-day, and take it in at 
sundown. 

When dry, it is carried over the white- 
paved roads five to forty miles to 
market at a cross-roads store or the 
nearest port town. The richer planter 
leads a donkey with paniers heaped 
above the ginger with pineapples, 
yams, and strange-looking fruits, and 
over all bunches of sugar cane and 
nets filled with green cocoanuts. But 
most of the crop is moved by head- 
loads. 

"Troops of Jamaica's brown and 
yellow daughters trudge up and down 
hill, under the terrible sun, with a load 
of a hundred pounds or more at grace- 
ful equipoise on their gaily turbaned 
heads. All have their garments 
kilted up to their bare, dark knees. 
These women have taken their color 
from the fruits. Their complexions 
are orange, olive, sapota, mango, deep- 
ening into a bronze-black. They are 
as upright as darts, walk with a free, 
tmhindered stride, without any swinging 
of the shoulders, impressing one greatly 
with their grace and elegance of motion. 
Carrying their heads like queens, with- 
out nod or turning, they cry out in a 
high-pitched musical key to the by- 
standers, 'Maming, buckra,' and pass 
on, their naked feet making a great 
whispering sound over the smooth road- 
way. In this picturesque way ginger 
passes to the market town." 

Here buyers pay about three cents 
a heap for it, the size of the heap 
varying with the season. With a 
quick eye and touch gained by long 
experience it is sorted, graded, and 
priced, and then barreled for shipment. 
The so-called blue variety is shipped 
undried, to supply the demand for the 
fresh root for pickles ^nd preserves, 
and the yellow variety, which is more 
valuable, is dried, and brings a higher 
price. 



Furniture and Floors 

A FURNITURE polish, which was 
recommended by a leading piano 
company of Boston, is made by mixing 
one part of kerosene with two parts of 
linseed oil. It has proven to be very 
good. To use, clean the furniture 
thoroughly, then apply the polish with 
a woolen rag, using no more than is 
necessary, and rubbing off with another 
clean woolen cloth. More liberal ap- 
plications will remove white , spots. 
Sometimes, however, much effort may 
be saved by rubbing the white places 
with alcohol. The alcohol should be 
used with care, for some varnishes only 
get worse under the treatment. For 
instance, it would not be advisable to 
use it on a piano. Use the polish alone. 

The success of the above mixture on 
furniture has suggested a treatment for 
hard'Wood floors, which has proved 
highly satisfactory. These floors are 
finished with a floor varnish. As little 
water as possible is used upon them, for 
nothing hurts a floor so much as water. 
It causes wide cracks and darkens the 
wood, so it looks grimy, no matter how 
much it is scrubbed. An occasional 
rubbing with a cloth moistened with 
kerosene will keep a floor in condition 
ordinarily. When it gets too dirty for 
this, wash with warm— not hot — water 
and a mild soap. Wash a small space 
at a time, wipe absolutely dry, and rub 
at once with a very Utile kerosene. 
Finish with an application of the linseed 
oil floor polish, and rub well. Unless 
very bad, the floor will look like new. 

Pkiin, boiled linseed oil is a good 



finish for the Idtchen floor. It should 
be put on when the floor is new or clean 
of other finish, and applied as needed 
afterwards. Such a floor will have a 
pleasing, light brown color, will not show 
marks or scratches, and, kept well oiled, 
will not spot with grease. Heat the 
oil and apply at night, rubbing it in 
well. In the morning wipe with cold 
water, and the floor is ready for use 
Wash it with warm water dashed with 
a little kerosene. c. D. 



Oeaning Bottles 

CUT-GLASS water bottles; oil or 
vinegar cruets, or vases stained or 
cloudy by the water, etc., can very 
easily be cleaned and made bright and 
sparkling. Take egg-shells, crush 
coarsely, with table salt one-fourth a 
cup, and vinegar one-half a cup. Put 
into water bottle or article to be 
cleaned, and shake thoroughly a minute 
or so. Then turn all out. Rinse with 
clear water and until all particles of 
shell are removed. Place on asbestos 
mat on back of the range for an hour 
or two to become perfectly dry. The 
result will be a very clean, bright, and 
shining piece of glass. B. R. A. C. 



Quick Graham Bread 

ONE quart of sour milk, two eggs, 
two and one-half cups of wheat 
flour, three and one-half cups of Graham 
flour, three tablespoonfuls of molasses, 
two level teaspoonfuls of soda, dissolved

in two tablespoonfuls of hot water, one 
teaspoonful of salt. Bake one hour. 

Graham Popovers 

One pint of sweet milk, three eggs, 
one cup of Graham flour, one cup of 
wheat flour, one tablespoonf ul of sugar, 
one tablespoonful of melted butter, 
one teaspoonful of salt. Beat the eggs 
very light, add the milk, and pour the 
liquid on the dry ingredients, previously 
mixed. Add melted butter last, and 
beat with an egg-beater until bubbles 
appear on the top. Bake one hour in 
buttered earthen cups. The oven 
should be moderate until they have 
doubled in height. 

Potato Biscuit 

One and one-half cups of flour, one 
teaspoonful of baking-powder, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt, one cup of mashed 
potato. Mix all with a little milk to 
moisten to the thickness of baking- 
powder biscuit, roll out, cut in rounds, 
and bake twenty minutes in a quick 
oven. Mrs. P. N. E. 

To remove Stains from White 

Goods 

COFFEE marks are easily removed 
by placing the stains over a bucket 
and pouring boiling water upon them. 
Then hang up to dry. 

Fruit stains should be treated like 
coffee, tea the same, and, if they do not 
disappear, rub gently with a weak 
solution of oxalic add, and rinse well in 
warm water. 

Grease will usually disappear by 
moistening with a strong solution of 
household ammonia and water; cover 
with blotting paper, and iron dry. 
Powdered French chalk is nice for silks 
or woolen goods. 

For iron rust or ink, squeeze fresh 
lemon juice on the spots, cover with 
table salt, and put in the sun. You 
may have to' repeat this several times, 
and often you will be obliged to rub 



well between the hands. Rinse in a 
weak solution of household ammonia 
and water. 

Scorch, if not very brown, will dis- 
appear when put in the bright sunshine. 
If bad, dip in soap suds and put in the 
sun, or it may be dipped in borax and 
water, then dried in the sun. 

Fresh grass stains will come out when 
rubbed with alcohol. 

Every one knows turpentine will 
remove paint from fabrics, also from 
window glass. So will benzine or 
naphtha. 

To remove tar or carriage grease, 
rub with lard, then soak in buttermilk, 
then rub between the hands, and rinse 
in buttermilk. Mildew can be treated 
in the same way, omitting the lard. 
Machine oil comes out quickly, if first 
rubbed with lard. 

The unsightly ring cleaning fluids 
leave, when used for removing spots, 
may be avoided by placing under the 
spot a pad made of thick absorbent 
cotton. 

Nourishing Food and Drink in One 
Often our respected doctor comes in 
and orders a patient **milk diet" 
or "milk punch," and this same pa- 
tient is one who is immediately upset 
by milk. Now, to meet such an oc- 
casion, I want to tell the home care- 
taker of a splendid discovery. I am 
one of those unfortunates who are often 
considered obstinate, if not a * 'crank," 
because I am unable to digest milk. 
Recently I was ill, and, when the milk 
question came up, my nurse rose suc- 
cessfully to the occasion by saying, 
"Doctor, may I substitute barley water 
for milk?" His "Yes" was somewhat 
weak, but the next day, when she 
handed him a glass of barley punch, he 
asked: "Why, how do you make it? 
It is delicious!" It is so satisfactory 
that I should like to "pass it on." 

Wash through several waters half a 
cup of pearl barley. Drain, and put it 
on to cook in an agate or porcelain-

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



lined stew-pan with one and one-half 
quarts of cold water. Set on the back 
of the range to heat slowly. Then 
simmer gently six hours. Should the 
water evaporate and the barley look 
thick, add more water, and simmer a 
little longer, so as to have one quart. 
Strain this through a sieve. Then set 
away to cool. This is to be used in 
place of milk for any hot or cold drink 
you may desire to make. The following 
suggestions may be helpful: Beat an 
egg Ught. Add to it a Uttle sugar and 
nutmeg to taste, a little cracked ice, a 
little flavoring, such as orange juice, 
pineapple, or whiskey, according to 
order. Then fill the glass with cold 
barley water, and it is ready to serve, 
accompanied by a delicate Uttle wafer 
(if allowable). You will find cocoa 
simply delicious made with barley water 
in place of milk. In cold weather you 
can prepare the barley water in sufficient 
quantity to last two da)rs, but in sum- 
mer make it fresh every morning. A 
quart glass preserve jar is the nicest 
thing to keep it in. Never use tin to 
put anything away in, as it gives a 
peculiar taste. L. n.

HOW do you manage to attend 
so many club and committee 
meetings?" was asked of the president 
of a large suburban club, for it was well 
known that she was an excellent house- 
keeper as well as a devoted mother. 

The answer, given with the kindly 
but genuinely mischievous smile which 
had much to do with her popularity, 
was as unexpected as it was honest.

Impromptu Plum Pudding 

WHEN making Boston brown 
bread by the recipe given in the 
Boston Cooking-School Magasdne, take 



out, when thoroughly mixed, two and 
one-half cups of the dough. Add to 
this one-half a cup of raisins, one-half 
a cup of molasses, one heaping table- 
spoonful of brown sugar and one of 
butter, one-half a cup of nuts, chopped 
fine, and any left-over preserves or 
jellies on hand. Steam as you do the 
bread, and serve hot with brandy 
sauce. This calls for scarcely five 
minutes' extra work, when one is mak- 
ing bread, and the pudding is quite as 
good as the average plum pudding.

LINOLEUM is one of the best cover-

THE collection of menu cards opens

If it becomes a fad to collect auto-

QuBRY 1203. — R. B. L., New York City: 
"Recipe for strained chicken gumbo soup 
served in cups at hotels." 

Strained Chicken Gumbo Soup 

Slice a large onion and cut one-fourth 
a potmd of lean raw ham into tiny 
bits. Stir and cook these in three 
or foiu- tablespoonfuls of hot lard or 
butter until lightly browned. Add 
half a cup of flour and stir imtil frothy. 
Then add gradually three pints of 
chicken broth, one pint of canned or 
fresh tomatoes, half a green pepper- 
pod, two or three sprigs of parsley, 
and two stalks of celery. Let simmer 
half an hour. Then strain, add salt 
to season, and reheat to the boiling- 
point. Then stir with one hand, while 
with the other two tablespoonfuls of 
fiU powder is sprinkled into the soup. 
Do not let the soup boil after the fiU 
powder is stirred into it. A quart 
of green okra pods cut into small pieces 
may be added with the parsley and 
tomato, being removed when the soup 
is strained. In this case the filS 
powder should be omitted.

QuBRY 1205.— Mrs. W. T. R., Charlotte- 
town, P.E.I., Canada: "At what hour in 
the evening should dough be set? I use 
royal yeast cake and sometimes what is called 
perpetual yeast. My bread is wet and forms 
a dough in the mouth instead of being crumbly. 
It does not make good toast. Is bread im- 
proved by being allowed to rise a second time 
in the morning? Kindly tell me on what to 
feed children whose teeth are decajring rapidly, 
though the children seem healthy and strong 
and live plainly." 

Preparing for Bread at Night, etc. 

Never having used either of the 
varieties of yeast mentioned above, 
we are unable to answer this sub- 
scriber explicitly. The dry yeast cakes 
that we have used make most ex- 
cellent bread; but the process of bread- 
making takes more time than when 



Queries and Answers

compressed yeast cakes, such as are 
common in this section of the coimtry, 
are used. With the variety of diy 
yeast that we have used a small 
quantity of "sponge" is set about five 
o'clock in the afternoon, and by nine 
or ten o'clock this is ready to use in 
mixing bread. The bread is cut down 
at six o'clock in the morning, some- 
times it is allowed to stand after cutting 
down tmtil again light, and again it is 
put into the pans at once. It would 
be well to study the recipes and direc- 
tions sent out with yeast, for the bread 
described above cannot be wholesome. 
Study also the directions and recipes 
sent out with the bread-mixer. We can- 
not give exact quantities of the in- 
gredients to be used without testing 
the results with the ingredients them- 
selves. To secure good results with 
a bread-mixer, the proper quantity of 
all the ingredients must be put into 
the mixer before the crank is turned. 
If more liquid or flour be needed, it 
must be mixed in by hand. In shap- 
ing machine-mixed dough for the pans, 
knead it even more than is necessarv 
to shape the loaves. When first using 
a bread-mixer and the yeast, etc., 
differs from that given in the recipes, 
make a note of the exact quantity of 
each article used, then, when you have 
gotten yoiu" proportions right, you can 
mix bread quickly and without hand 
kneading. 

Food for Children with Poor Teeth 

The condition of achild's second teeth 
depends largely upon the food taken 
and the health of the child during the 
years just preceding second dentition. 
Protein and other bone-making ele- 
ments must be present in ample pro- 
portion in the food eaten while the teeth 
are in process of formation. The proper 
food must be provided, and the child 
should transform it into teeth and bone. 
Lack of bone-making elements at this 
time shows itself in contracted jaw 
bone too small for strong teeth or 



improperly formed teeth, as also in small 
bodily frame. This is why mothers 
should acquaint themselves with the 
composition of food. Many a child 
who eats ravenously is not properly 
nourished. Among the articles of food 
desirable at this time are corn-meal 
(Rhode Island corn-bread is excellent 
not only for the teeth, but it also has 
other good qualities), barley, rye-meal, 
Graham flour, oatmeal, cooked firm, 
and in crackers, macaroni, peas, beans, 
eggs, milk, lamb, poultry, beef, and 
fish. The mineral salts needed at 
this time are found in the above and 
also in green string beans, peas, and 
Lima beans, spinach, celery, tomatoes, 
cranberries, peaches, apples, and other 
stewed fruits. 



QuBRY 1206.— "Puzzled": "How can I 
harden quince jelly?' 



If* 



To harden Quince Jelly 

Prepare some apple juice as in jelly- 
making. Let boil ten or fifteen min- 
utes, and dissolve the quince jelly 
in it. Then, when boiling again, add 
hot sugar equal in measure to the apple 
juice, and let boil imtil the mixtiu'e 
jelUes on a cool plate. Use one-foiulh 
as much apple juice as quince jelly. 
When making quince jelly, discard 
the cores of the quinces, and the jelly 
will probably set without the addition 
of apple juice. 



Query 1207. — C. W., Stockbridge, Mass.: 
In making crab apple jelly this year, we cut 
down the quantity of sugar called for in our 
recipe half a pound, and, even when boiled 
the second time, the jelly would not harden. 
Was the smaller quantity of sugar the reason 
why the jelly would not jell?" 



f I 



Sugar in Crab-apple Jelly 

As we do not know the proportions 
of sugar and fruit juice, we are unable 
to say wlfy the jelly did not become 
firm. Crab-apple jelly is easily made, 
and, though liquid at the time of pour- 
ing into the glasses, it becomes firm

when set aside in a dry place. Our 
rule is three-fourths a cup of sugar to 
one cup of juice. In preparing the 
juice, we pour cold water into the dish 
of apples imtil we can see the water 
just below the upper layer of apples. 



Query 1208.— F. H., Winsted, Ct.: "In 
making the baked maple custard given in 
magazine for February, 1904, what sugar is 
used in making the snow eggs, confectioner's 
or powdered? The eggs do not stay up 
fluify, and a sort of syrup runs out over the 
custard." 

Concerning Snow Eggs 

In making snow eggs, the kind of 
sugar is immaterial. Everything de- 
pends on the cooking. The water 
should be at the boiling-point when 
the eggs are put into it, and it should 
not boil thereafter, but be kept very 
hot. It will take at least twenty min- 
utes to cook the eggs, sometimes half 
an hour is none too long. Ttun the 
eggs several times during the cooking, 
but cook just as long on one side as 
on the other. Remove from the water 
to a cloth with a skimmer, and, when 
drained, set in place. // properly 
cooked^ nothing will exude from the 
meringue.

QuBRY 1 2 10. — Mrs. L. R. E., Fort Leaven- 
worth, Kan.: "Recipes for curried beef or 
chicken, chutney similar to that imported by 
a New York firm, and a simple boiled Graham 
pudding." 



Curried Chicken (Raw Chicken) 

Cut a cleaned chicken into pieces 
at the joints, and season with salt, 
paprika, and ginger. Let stand while 
three onions and two sour apples, 
with a kitchen bouquet are fried in 
half a cup of butter, or dripping, to a 
g6lden brown. Then put in the joints, 
cover the pan, and let cook eight or 
ten minutes. Sprinkle in half a grated 
cocoanut, add the milk from the nut 
(or use a cup of almond milk), stirred 
gradually into three tablespoonfuls of 
flour and one of ctury powder, two red 
pepper-pods, cut in shreds, a pint of 
stock or hot water, and the juice of a 
lemon, and let simmer one hour. Take 
up the joints of meat and keep them 
hot. Pass the sauce through a very 
fine sieve. Form a border of boiled 
rice on a serving-dish, and within it 
dispose the meat with the sauce poured 
over. 

Curried Chicken (Cooked Chicken) 

Cook two or three slices of onion in 
one-fotulh a cup of butter. Add one- 
fourth a cup of flour and one table- 
spoonful of curry powder, and stir 
until the whole is well blended. Then 
add two cups of chicken broth, half 
a teaspoonftd of salt, pepper to taste, 
half an apple, grated, and the juice 
of an orange (or, in place of the apple 
and orange jtuce, use two large table- 
spoonfuls of cturant jelly and the 
juice of half a lemon). Let simmer 
five or six minutes, then remove the 
onion, and add one pint of cooked 
chicken, cut in small pieces, and let

East India Chutney (Apple) 

The following is called good chutney, 
but probably it dififers from the one 
referred to, which we have not tasted. 
Pare and core twelve sour apples. Peel 
one mild onion. Remove the seeds and 
stem from three peppers, one of which 
should be red. Seed one cup of raisins, 
and extract the juice of four lemons. 
Chop the apples, peppers, raisins, and 
onion very fine. Add one pint of cider 
vinegar and half a cup of currant 
jelly, and let simmer very gently one 
hour, stirring often. Add one pint of 
cider vinegar, two cups of sugar, one 
tablespoonful, each, of salt and ground 
ginger, and one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
cayenne, and cook another hour, stirring 
constantly. Store as canned fruit. 

Boiled Graham Pudding 

See recipe for **A Simple Steamed 
Pudding," page 258, December, 1906, 
magazine. Substitute a cup of Graham 
flour for the entire-wheat flour given 
in the recipe. As a pudding steamed 
in a mould is much better than a 
pudding boiled in a cloth, we do not 
see why any one should continue to 
boil a pudding. If one does not own 
a steamer, — ^most women would not 
know how to keep house without one, — 
make holes in the covers of three or 
four baking-powder boxes, and place 
them in the bottom of a saucepan. Set 
the filled pudding mould on these, and 
pour in cold or tepid water. Cover, 
and let cook the required length of 
time. If the water needs replenish- 
ing, use boiling water. With a proper 
steam kettle, cooking can go on at 
least four hotu^ before the steamer 
becomes dry.

A Doctor's Sleep 

Found he had to leave off Coffee 

Many persons do not realize that a 
bad stomach will cause insomnia. 

Coffee-drinking being such an ancient 
and respectable form of stimulation, few 
realize that the drug — caffeine — con- 
tained in coffee and tea is one of the 
principal causes of dyspepsia and ner- 
vous troubles. 

Without their usual portion of coffee 
or tea the caffeine topers are nervotis, 
irritable, and fretful. That's the way 
with a whiskey-drinker. He has got to 
have his dram * 'to settle his nerves, " — 
habit. 

To leave off coffee is an easy matter 
if you want to try it, because Postum — 
well boiled according to directions — 
gives a gentle but natural support to 
the nerves, and does not contain any 
drug, — ^nothing but food. 

Physicians know this to be true, as 
one from Georgia writes:— 

'*I have ctu-ed myself of a long- 
standing case of nervous d3^pepsia by 
leaving off coffee and using Postum 
Food Coffee," ssljs the doctor. 

"I also enjoy refreshing sleep, to 
which I have been an utter stranger for 
twenty years. 

"In treating d3^pepsia in its various 
types, I find little trouble when I can 
induce patients to quit coffee and adopt 
Postum." The doctor is right, and 
* 'there's a reason." Read the little 
book, **The Road to WellviUe," in 
packages.

Query 12x4. — Mrs. R. C, Ossinning, N.Y.: 
"Can vou tell me why my cake is not fine- 
grained, but is stiff rather than soft?" 

Fine-grained Cake 
We think you are using too much 
(lour in your cake. In our published 
recipes the flour is measiu-ed^ after 
sifting. The cup is not filled by dip- 
ping into the flour, but the flour is 
put into the cup with a spoon and then 
leveled ofiF with a knife. This gives a 
light measure of flour. The flour will 
not weigh four ounces, which we think 
should be the weight of a cup of flour. 
To make a fine-grained cake, first 
beat the butter to a cream, then gradu- 



ally beat the sugar into it, to make a 
hght fluffy mass. Beat in the milk 
and flour, alternately, and, unless a 
very small quantity of leavening (bak- 
ing-powder or soda and cream of tartar) 
has been used, beat the mixture 
vigorously after the whites of eggs and 
all other ingredients have been added. 



White Bread 

Makes Trouble for People with Weak 
Intestinal Digestion 

A lady in a Wisconsin town employed 
a physician who instructed her not to 
eat white bread for two years. She 
tells the details of her sickness, and she 
certainly was a sick woman. 

**In the year 1887 I g*^ve out from 
overwork, and tmtil 190 1 I remained 
an invalid in bed a great part of the 
time. Had diff^^ent doctors, but noth- 
ing seemed to help. I suffered from 
cerebro - spinal congestion, female 
trouble, and serious stomach and bowd 
trouble. My husband called a new 
doctor, and, after having gone without 
any food for ten days, the doctor or- 
dered Grape-nuts for me. I could eat 
the new food from the very first mouth- 
ful. The doctor kept me on Grape- 
nuts, and the only medicine was a little 
glycerine to heal the alimentary canal. 

* * When I was' up again, doctor told 
me to eat Grape-nuts tmce a day, and 
no white bread for two years. I got 
well in good time, and have gained in 
strength, so I can do my own work 
again. 

' 'My brain has been helped so much, 
and I know that the Grape-nuts food 
did this, too. I fotmd I had been made 
ill because I was not fed right; that is, 
I did not properly digest white bread 
and some other food I tried to live on. 

"I have never been without Grape- 
nuts food since, and eat it every day. 
You may publish this letter if you like, 
so it will help some one else." Name

Cooking in a Lumber Camp 

{Continued from page 327.) 

Baked Beans. — One of the leading 
features of camp cooking is baked 
beans. The abilities of a camp cook 
are largely judged by the bread he 
makes and the beans he bakes. Beans 
fit in with the heavy work of the woods 
as no other food does. Generally, the 
beans for dinner are looked over, and 
^put on to cook about five o'clock in the 
afternoon. They are allowed to par- 
boil until the sldns of the beans, when 
taken up on a spoon and blown on, will 
crack open. The water is then drained 
off, the beans are poured out into a dish- 
pan, and a pail of water is poured over 
to wash them. They are dipped back 
into the kettle with a skimmer. When 
the kettle is about two-thirds full, 
a piece of fat salt pork, weighing four to 
five pounds in case of a twelve-quart 
kettle, is added. The pork is first cut 
into slices through the rind as for frying, 
and all the slices are left hanging to- 
gether at the bottom. It is next cut 
crosswise in the same manner, forming 
checks about one-fourth inch square 
and two or three inches long, or the 
thickness of the meat. Thus prepared, 
it is put into the centre of tie kettle 
and surrotmded and covered with beans. 
About two tablespoonfuls of table 
molasses is then added, to give the beans 
a rich brown color and pepper to taste. 
The kettle is then filled with water until 
the beans are just covered, and a tight- 
fitting cover is put on. The beans are 
set in the oven at night, just before 
going to bed, and are baked all the fol- 
lowing forenoon until dinner-time at a 
temperature hot enough for bread. 

About one-half inch of the top of the 
beans will be burned black and, per- 
haps, some on the bottom and sides 
of the kettle, but the remainder, served 
steaming hot, are delicious beyond 
comparison. The excellence is due in 
great measure to the six or eight hours' 
continuous baking and the use of well 
salted or pickled fat pork. Lean pork 



or fresh pork never makes good baked 
beans. 

Supper, — For supper all kinds of 
cookies and cakes the cook knows how 
to make will be put on the table. Sun- 
day nights a layer cake with cornstarch 
filling or jelly, made from evaporated 
apples, may be served. All cakes and 
cookies are made either with baking- 
powder or sour dough and soda. Some- 
times vinegar and soda are us6d in 
making cookies. No eggs or milk 
enter into their composition, because 
they are seldom furnished, and it would 
surprise one who has not tried it to find 
what really excellent and palatable cakes 
and cookies can be made without them. 

Sour dough is simply flour and water 
mixed to the thickness of gravy. A 
yeast cake may be added to the first 
batch. This is allowed to ferment 
until it is sour, when it is used exactly 
like sour milk, except in larger quanti- 
ties and for the same ptuposes. A 
little of the dough is left in the vessel 
each time as leavening for the new- 
batch, in the same way as for buck- 
wheat pancakes. 

Prune, dried apple, or some other 
sauce will also be served for supper. 
Some cooks have bean or pea soup twice 
a week for supper. Others always 
have the soup for dinner. In addition 
there will be hot buns, sometimes with 
currants in them, or biscuit, boiled 
potatoes with browned flour gravy, 
cod fish gravy, or Irish stew. Hash also

is a common supper dish. Tea is served 
regularly. Cheese is sometimes sup- 
plied as a treat. 

Washing the Dishes. — For a crew of 
eighty men it will take two active 
men who understand the business 
about two and one-half hours to clear 
the tables and wash up the breakfast 
dishes, about one and one-half hours 
the dinner dishes, and twenty minutes 
to three-fourths an hour the supper 
dishes. For supper there are not so 
many* pots and kettles to wash, and 
none of the bread, cake, cookies, sauce, 
or butter plates, are Washed. 

In gathering the dirty dishes from 
the table, they are not scraped. What- 
ever food there may be on them is 
simply dumped onto the oil cloth. 
This makes dirty dish water, but plenty 
of rinsing is relied on to get them clean. 
The secret of rapid dish-washing is 
plenty of hot rinsing water, melted 
soap, and every dish gathered up and 
in place before washing begins. The 
knives, forks, and spoons are washed 
first by covering with hot water and 
soap, and shaking vigorously two 
minutes in the dish-pan, and rinsing 
with hot water. A dish-cloth is sel- 
dom used on the knives and forks. 

How the Wastes are used. — Stale bread 
is made into toast, dressing, pudding, 
and pancakes, and, when the supply 
of potatoes is short, it is used as a part 
substitute in hash. Toast may he 
served either for breakfast or supper. 



It is quickly made by laying the oven 
grates on top of the stove and toasting 
the bread on these. After toasting, 
it is dipped into sweetened hot water 
and melted butter, and served. 

The smaller pieces of bread are made 
into dressings and puddings. For dress- 
ing the bread is moistened with water, 
mixed with mashed potatoes, seasoned 
with plenty of onion, pepper, salt, and 
butter or fried meat grease, and baked 
about one and a half hours. Sage 
is often used in place of the onion. 

Bread pudding is made by thoroughly 
moistening the bread with water, sea- 
somng with butter, and mixing with 
either English currants or raisins. It 
is baked about an hour and a half, and 
will raise up quite Ught and porous. 
This is served with a sauce made by 
boiling together water, sugar, and 
butter, flavoring with nutmeg or lemon, 
and thickening with flour. 

Occasionally stale bread is thoroughly 
soaked and stirred into a batter with 
sour dough, hghtened with soda, and 
baked into pancakes. Pancakes aie 
made, however, only in small crews 
of twenty to thirty men. It requires 
too much work with a larger crew ot 
rather they cannot be made fast enough. 
If made beforehand, the first ones be- 
come cold and stale before they can 
be served. 

Stale Cake.— The dried and stale pieces 
of cake are used in bread puddings, 
and sometimes, mixed into a batter

with water, seasoned with raistns or 
currants, spices, and sometinies vine- 
gar, are used as filling for pies without 
top crusts. As a pie batter, this ma- 
terial is not an entire success, and a 
good many men will be seen pouring 
molasses over their pie at dinner- 
time. It is, however, used occa^oally, 
and makes a change for the cook, if 
not for the men. 

With a large crew stale cake of the 
various kinds accumulates very rapidly, 
and is a source of considerable anxiety 
to the cook. To throw it away looks 
like waste, and might cause the fore- 
nan to become unduly excited, — an 
event which might be taken into 
account when pay-day- came for the 
cook. Most cooks, therefore, bum it 
up on the theory that smoke tells no 
tales. In fact, this is a favorite way 
of many cooks for dispodng of odds 
and ends that are good, yet would look 
mussy or unsavory on the table, and 
are not sufficient to make up into any- 
thing worth while. 

Meat Wastes. — ^The mussed and odd 
ends of meats are made into hash and 
stews in the usual ways. In making 
hash, about twice as much beef is taken 
as pork. Cold boiled potatoes should 
make up two-thirds of the mixture, 
and the whole be seasoned with an 
abundance of pepper, salt, and onions. 
The meat and potatoes and onions are 
chopped fine, thoroughly mixed with 
water, and put into deep dripping-pans 
to bake, with lumps of butter or frieil 
meat drippings scattered freely on top. 
It is baked without stirring about one 
and a half hours. Camp hash, like 
camp beans, has a deservedly good 
reputation. 

Irish stew, or ragout, is made by cut- 
ting up the odds and ends of bonified 
meats in pieces ranging in size from a 
hazelnut to a walnut. Cut cold pota- 
toes of the same size are added, and all 
put into a kettle, with onion for flavor- 
ing. Water to cover the whole is then 
added, with pepper and butter. After

Camp Life. — ^A cook in a Itmiber 
camp must be strong and robust. For 
the first three months there is seldom 
a period of ten minutes for rest during 
the entire day. After that the cook 
may get from thirty minutes to an hour 
and a half every afternoon, because the 
men do not eat so much. The most 
trying part is that there is neither Sun- 
day nor holiday. The work is con- 
tinuous, and, while the first few Sun- 
days may pass without any special 
thought of it, there soon comes a long- 
ing for a day of rest. 

The minute the table is set at night 
and every thing is ready for breakfast, 
the cook drops into bed. Sweet sleep 
comes with the closing of the eyelids, 
and the next minute the alarm goes 
off. While still asleep and the alarm 
still ringing, you are out of bed and half 
dressed. Even to think of just a mo- 
ment's more sleep might keep eighty 
men waiting half an hotu- for break- 
fast. 

Through the day and evening there 
is a good deal of bantering and good- 
natured raillery in the camp, but scarce 
a word is spoken tmtil after breaks 
fast. Not even the jolliest cook feels 
awake enough to taUc tmtil the sun 
rises. 

Women cook in lumber camps and 
do the work well, but it is fearfully 
hard for them, and more help is re- 
quired. A good cook makes it his 
first business to please the men. Other- 
wise life will be made a burden to him 
tmtil he leaves. The wise cook offers 
a man a lunch or piece of pie every time 
he comes in the cook camp.

The New Coolc 

A young housekeeper in one of the 
suburbs had just succeeded in getting 
a new cook, who came highly recom- 
mended. One day Nora made a sponge 
cake which was so hard it could not 
be eaten. The housekeeper said: 

' 'Nora, do you call this sponge 
cake? Why, it's as hard as can be." 

"Yes, mum," replied the cook, calmly. 
' "That's the way a sponge is before it's 
wet. Soak it in your tea, mum." 



Kaiser on Good Cooking 

Thinks that it ii Neceuary to the CoDtcntmcnt 
of the People 

Emperor William regards good cook- 
ing as ncessary to the contentment of 
the people. While inspecting the 
kitchen of a convent school at Obem- 
kirchen, he saw the pupils cooking, and 
said: — 

"If the cooking was everywhere as 
good as it is here, the feeling of the 
country would be better. Cookiag 
and food are of great importance. 
Good cooking helps to improve general 
contentment."

Quality in Grape Fruit 



IT takes time to produce Grape Fruit — it has taken time, 
skill and a great deal of money to produce such fruit as that 
grown by The Atwood Co., of Manavista, Fla. 
With 250 acres devoted to it exclusively, this company has 
learned how to raise good Grape Fruit — the finest sort that 
comes out of Florida — thin-skinned, smooth, heavy with 
luscious juice. 

A delectable breakfast fruit, it is cleansing to the system, and 
taken at night on retiring it is a splendid conservative of health. 
Cut the fruit in cross sections, remove the core completely, 
and serve with or without sugar. 

See that your dealer always sells you the Atwood brand of 
Grape Fruit, which is sold only in trade-mark wrappers.

Escoffier, the famous chef from the 
Carlton, London, has conquered the 
kaiser's prejudice against the French 
cuisine. Some time ago the emperor 
forbade the use of French on the im- 
perial menus. 

It was during the kaiser's Baltic 
cruise in the "Hamburg," when Es- 
cofher had charge of the cuisine for a 
week, that he changed his mind. One 
evening Kaiser Wilhelm was so de- 
lighted with the dinner provided that 
he insisted on seeing the cook and the 
kitchen where it was prepared. 

Escoffier was accordingly presented 
to His Imperial Majesty, who plied 
him with questions about his art. He 
then minutely inspected all the cu- 
linary arrangements, and before leav- 
ing the ship he presented the famous 
chef with a diamond pin with the im- 
perial crown and initials. 



John. Are you dining anywhere on 
Thursday ? 

Sandy (anticipating a free dinner): 
Thursday? Let me see. Monday, 
Tuesday, Wed — . No, I'm not dining 
anywhere on Thursday. 

John. Then you will be deuced 
hungry on Friday, won't you, old boy? 



Women dinner-tasters have received 
a great welcome since their appear- 
ance in Paris. Judging by the success 
of the new profesdon for the fair sex, 
it may be said that it has already be- 
come a recognized institution. Hie 
duty of these demoiselles and dames, 
in some cases, consists in driving round 
to the houses of patrons just before 
dinner-time and tasting the food. 
Much valuable cuUnary knowledge is 
reaped from such visits. Housewives 
are taught and given fresh suggestions 
as well as a few helpful hints regarding 
the following day's menu. Time is 
money with such visitors, hence why 
they never stop long, — not even to 
dinner.

Solving the Sphinx 
"Civilized man cannot live without 
cooks," says the poet. But a certain 
venturesome caterer has knocked this 
poetical assertion sky-high, and seems 
at last about to solve the riddle of the 
ages. 

He has opened in the heart of one of 
the restricted residence sections of 
Brooklyn — unfortunately not Phila- 
delphia — a place _that he is pleased to 
call, unofficially, a "neighborhood sup- 
ply station." 

A family can eat its three meals a 
day in the cosey, homelike dining-nxim, 
or a representative may call with a 
suit-case or basket or box stocked with 
dishes, and carry it, steaming with sav- 
ory comestibles, to be eaten under the 
home roof-tree. If company comes 
unexpectedly, if a luncheon or dinner 
party is to be given, whatever the exi- 
gency of domestic complexity, the cook's 
goings and comings cease to be of in- 
terest to the housekeeper. The caterer 
promises not to "give warning," nor 
pack his trunk and start off, whatever 
his grievance. He says he has come to 
stay, and that the new establishn^nt 
is only the first of nutny to follow it in 
other localities. 

The Gingerbread Barometer 

He buys a fresh one every year, — a 

fine, large, gingerbread colond, which 

he hangs by a string in the hall above 

the umbrella rack. 

All the world knows the atmospheric 
effect on gingerbread. The slightest 
moisture makes it soft and soggy. In 
dry weather, on the contrary, it be- 
come brittle and hard. 

Every morning, before starting for 
his office, he asks his wife : — 
"What does the colonel say?" 
The lady appUes her thumb to the 
figure, and answers: — 

"He feels flabby about the chest 
Better take your imibrella." 
Or, on the other hand, she will reply :— 
' "The colonel is hard and unyielding. 
If I were you, I'd wear my new hat,"

It's Easy for a Housewife 
to decide which article is best by test- 
ing at home, and, when a suffidenl 
quantity for that purpose can be had 
for nothing, it is unwise not to make 
the test 

If jrou have silverware, drop a postal 
to "Silicon," 30 Cliff Street, New York 
City, and you will receive, free of cost, 
a trial quantity of Electro-Silicon, 
The secret of keeping silverware bright 
and beautiful will then be revealed to 
you, and we promise you will be weU 
repaid for your trouble. 

Electro-Silicon is a powder of abso- 
lute purity and fineness, imparting a 
wonderful lustre with little labor and 
without the slightest injury to the most 
delicate surfaces of silverware and all 
fine metats. Its merits have secured 
for it the commendation of housekeepers 
everywhere. 

It is sold by grocers and druggists 
generally or sent postpaid by the man- 
ufacturers on receipt of 15 cents per 
box in stamps. 

Polishing Furniture 
The manager of a furniture factory 
says that, if women understood the 
value of soap and water, there woutd 
not be so many calls for furniture 
polish. But soap and water must be 
used with judgment, as strong soap 
would be injurious. Make a tepid suds 
of Ivory Soap, dip a cloth in it, 
squeeze, and go over the furniture 
several times. Polish with a chamois 
cloth. 

The Post-office Department gained 
$15,000,000 last year in revenues. 
, Where is the crying need of imposing in- 
creased postage charges on the people's 
university, the press? 

Do not go up against another man's 
game. Get a game of your own, and 
play it to the Umit. And, by the way, 
a game where both parties do not 
win is immoral.

FROM BDITOR TO RKADSR 



Some Features of tiie Cookii^-School Hapzine to be noted 

Good in 1906. Better in 1907 



FIRST 

The magazine is distinctively culinary in character. On all 
that pertains to the selection, preparation, cooking, and serving of 
food it is no secondary authority. Specialization rather than 
generalization is its marked feature. 

SCCOND 

The entire time and attention of the editor are given to render 
the contents of each issue reliable, practical, and helpful in the 
household. Tried and tested, all rules and recipes are workable. 
Her work is found in the contributions to no other publication. 
Every letter of inquiry addressed to the magazine receives the 
editor's personal attention and considerate answer. We w^ant 
our subscribers to continue their subscription from year to year. 

THIRD 

The magazine has long had a national reputation. Its cir- 
culation is steadily increasing. North, South, East, and West. 
Among our most appreciative readers are subscribers in Canada 
and other foreign lands. And yet, moderately speaking, there are 
to<iay no fewer than one hundred thousand homes in the land 
where this magazine is needed and wanted. To reach these 
homes we rely largely upon the kindly aid of our present sub- 
scribers. A chief reason for this is the confidence we feel that 
they who have a good thing want to pass it on to neighbor or 
friend. 

FOURTH 

Notwithstanding, we are glad to pay liberally for securing 
new subscriptions. Will our readers please note from time 
to time the premiums we offer for sending new subscriptions. 
Send us now two new subscriptions^ and receive a renewal of your own 
subscription for one year free.

Tell us how much Lard your grocer 

sells and we will tell you how 

much indigestion is in 

the neighborhood. 



Lard is made from hog-fat and 
is bound to be greasy and indigest- 
ible — sometimes absolutely un- 
healthy. There isn't an ounce of 
hog-fat in Cottolene. Its basis is 
just pure, refined Cotton seed oil, 
whicli is thoroughly digestible and 
healthful. 

The stomach of the average 
American has been subjected to 
lard-soaked food for years simply 
because people have not known the 
dangers of the "lard habit." Cot- 
tolene is much superior to lard, both 
as to the palatability of the food it 
produces and its healthful qualities, 



that it will surely supplant lard for 
shortening and frying purposes 
wherever its virtues are known. 
Give your poor stomach a chance — 
divorce yourself from lard, and use 
Cottolene. 

Cottolene is made by a cleanly, 
hygienic, sanitary process, which 
insures its purity. It is, moreover, 
healthful, because its chief ingred- 
ient is a healthful product. It will 
aid rather than retard digestion. 
The housewife who pays any 
attention to hygienic cooking will 
use Cottolene in place of lard every 
time.

FROM EDITOR TO READER 



EDITORIAL NOTES 

We think the contents of this number are wide, 
varied, timely, and exceptionally good. Note espec- 
ially the article on "Cookery for Young House- 
keepers, " or ' * Cooking for two. ' ' This is the intro- 
ductory chapter of a series of lessons to beginners in 
housekeeping. No pains will be spared to make 
these lessons helpful and profitable. Write us how 
you feel about this, and what your special wants are. 

The Editor is ever at the service of the readers of 
this magazine. Through the pages of the current 
issues, or by private letter she will personally answer 
every letter of inquiry addressed to this office. She 
is entirely responsible for the accuracy, reliability 
and character of the culinary contents of the maga- 
zine. She aims to give plain and simple directions 
in every process called for in the preparation and 
serving of food. 

Agents can not be depended on to notify us of 
orders to discontinue subscriptions; for this service 
they are not paid. Notification by card or letter, 
addressed to this office, will receive prompt attention. 
We are always sorry, however, to take from our list 
the name of a subscriber. To make any change in 
our list we must be given the last or old address of 
the writer. 

The date of expiration of your subscription is 
stamped each month in red ink on the wrapper. Our 
wrappers must be written during the month prior to 
that of publication. Consequently, in case of many 
a renewal, the new date can not appear until the 
month following that in which it is received. 

The advertisements we carry are uniformly suitable 
to our pages. No one of them should be overlooked. 
Presenting the choicest of everything, they are adap- 
ted to conserve the best interests of our readers. 
*' Something for nothing isn't business. The adver- 
tisement which the reader pays for the privilege of 
seeing is worth a dozen times more than the ad- 
vertisement thrust upon him. From the reader's 
standpoint the bill-board advertisement is something 
for nothing and commands the respect of nobody.*'

The Emancipated Woman 

EVERY vocation is now open to the 20th Cen- 
tury woman, but 95 out of every 100 still are 
home-makers. Rights are freely accorded, 
but the greatest privilege comes in the making of 
homes. The true emancipated woman is the one 
who knows — who turns off her work easily and 
efficiently, who understands "the profession of 
home-makmg." 

Sometime — if not now — the health, the happi- 
ness, and even the life of your own flesh and blood 
will depend on your knowledge. Isn't it worth 
while to study systematically about hygiene, food, 
home management, children? This calls for no 
sacrifice — it will give enjoyment ; it will open up a 
new world of interest ; it will eliminate drudgery ; it 
will save time ; it will save dollars and cents. 

If you are interested in the " New Profession of 
Home- Making" and the "Art of Right Living," 
write to-day for the attractive booklet of the Amer- 
ican School of Home Economics which tells of their 
correspondence courses and gives sample pages and 
synopsis of the " Library of Home Economics."

It is very gratifying 

to be able to place before the public such books as Mrs.

has been won from years of practical personal experience 

and hard laborious study. 

Mrs. Rorer to-day is the acknowledged leader in 
this country on domestic science. Her latest works 
naturally embody the best results of all these years of

the last word on the subject. It is a complete new book 
of 736 pages, telling of the things one needs to know 
about cooking, living, health, and the easiest and best 
wajrs of housekeeping. Her Every Day Menu Book is 
a helper. It contains a menu for every meal in the year 
arranged by months and days; menus for special occa- 
sions; decorated tables for all social events, with appro- 
priate menus, etc. These two books are handsomely 
illustrated. All her books are good and they can be

A Chapter on Tea- Houses 

By MARY H. NORTHEND 



QUAINTEST among all -national 
emblems, is that of Japan, the 
tea-pot. Yet nothing could be 
more syiubolic, for Japan is a 
land of much tea, and the birthplace of 
the tea-house which has been so exten- 
sively copied in our own land. 

An appreciation of the picturesque is 



inborn in the Japanese, and, throughout 
this land of small but mighty people, each 
charming view, each mountain irath, and 
each shady retreat boasts its tea-house, 
where passers-by may pause to enjoy a re- 
freshing cup of the national beverage and 
the beauties of the scenery that surrounds 
him. 



358 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOI, MAGAZINE 



It is indeed pleasant to be seated on a 
low, crimson -covered bench, under the 
shade of the tea-house, and, from the 
serene height which has caused us so 
much labor and fatigue to attain, gaze 
down the winding path over which our 
weary feet have just traveled. Silence 
reigns supreme, and the perfume of cherry- 
blossoms fills the air. A clapping of hands 
breaks the silence and brings an old 
woman from some hidden recess to wait 
upon the wishes of her guests. "Hoi I 
Hoi!" she cries as she shuffles away to 
reappear in a few minutes with a tiny cup 
of tea, resting on a tray, and besides it a 
few sweetmeats placed upon white paper. 
When the tea is finished, a few pence left 
on the tray, the amount depending en 
what the giver chooses to afford, serve as 
payment, and quitting the tea-house the 
journey is resumed. 

Some of the tea-houses in Japan arc 
quite widely known, and at them a very 
sumptuous repast may be had if desired. 
Here one is served by the dainty Geisha 
girls who are specially trained for this pur- 



pose, and whose beauty and ^ace call 
forth admiration from all beholders who 
see them for the first time. 

The larger tea-houses are sometimes 
two stories in height, though more usually 
they are but one, and ther interiors are 
very prettily decorated. They ojien upon 
beautiful gardens, which contain, accord- 
ing to Japanese custom, row after row a( 
flowers of the same species. One garden 
boasts a marvelous collection of lillies, 
while Kiother is brilliant with the peony. 
Others show various flowers, but in no gar- 
den is there a combination of two species. 

Among the tea-houses that are famous 
in the land of Cherry-blossoms is the 
Maple-leaf tea-house. The Geisha girls 
wear gowns on which a multitude of bril- 
liant leaves gleam, and the interior of the 
house is bright with this favorite emblem 
of Canada. 

Tea-drinking in Japan and China differs 
greatly from the American function, in that, 
while with us it is a pleasant custom, 
with them it is a solemn duty, a re<]uirc- 
ment of hospitality, and to refuse to par- 



ol Mr. F, M, Whliehouse at Manchester, Mass. 



A CHAPTER ON TEA-HOUSES 



Tea-House on Kndicott Kstate, Danvers, Mass. 



take of the beverage would bring great 
censure upon one's head. However, it 
is not an unpleasant duty, for the tiny 
cups of straw-colored tea are very stimu- 
lating, which is fortunate, as shopkeepers 
and tradesmen olTer it to their customers, 
and the poor and the weahhy alike offer 
it to their friends and visitors. 

Now, not only tea-drinking, but tea- 
raising has been introduced into America, 
though as yet the latter is on a very small 
scale. Dr. Charles U. Shepard, on the 
Pinehurst estate near Charleston, raises a 
quantity of tea, and finds ready market 
for all his product. His best quality is 
raised under a shed of cocoa matting, and 
fetches a uniform price of one dollar per 
pound. 

Tea-houses, loo, have been introduced 
into America, and specially in New Eng- 
land are they found on the estates of 
wealthy families. These are by no means 
a recent innovation, for in our grand- 



mother's days, we read of tea drinkings 
in the little summer houses, or tea-houses 
which are the central features in some of 
the old-fashioned gardens. 

Perhaps the oldest of these tea-houses 
stands on the estate of Mrs. William C. 
Kndicott at Danvers, Mass. It is a two- 
story building painted in the conventional 
white with green blinds, and entrance may 
be had on either side the latticed door- 
ways. Ascending the stairs one finds her- 
self in a cosy room surrounded by cabinets 
holding Chinese ware brought from that 
country when America was young. Won- 
derful carvings are traced on the wood- 
work. The top IS mounted by a wooden 
figure of Father Time whetting his scythe. 
Originally there was another figure of a 
milkmaid with her pail. Many of Salem's 
beaux and belles have gathered in this 
quaint old tea-house to drink tea. 

The North Shore, not long ago inhab- 
ited by fishermen and farmers, but now

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



the Mecca of summer guests from Massa- 
chusetts to the Pacific coast, shows in its 
gardens many interesting tca-houscs, both 
ancient and modern. One of these cods 
the central path of the Hon. T. Jefferson 
CooUdge's garden at Manchester, Mass. 
It is vine-clad and overlooks the famous 
Italian garden with its old sun-dial and 
softly plashing fountain. 

Another popular though unpretentious 
tea-house is that of Mr. \\'aUer Denagre. 
It faces the tennis court, and during the 
summer is a favorite resort for the young 
people, who gather to rest after heated con- 
tests and to take tea in the quaint fashion 
of colonial days. 

Near the charming English garden 
which overlooks the sea at ihe summer 
home of Mr. F. M. Whitehouse at Man- 
chester, Mass., is one of the most pictur- 
esque little tea-houses to be found along 
the shore. It is hidden away at the foot 
of a crag, and is reached by winding steps 
of stone. It is indeed an ideal place to 
rest on a summer afternoon and to par- 
take of live o'clock tea. In the distance 
a view of the sea, losing itsclt in the mist 
ot the horizon, may be had from the red- 



roofed tea-house which cannot be rivalled 
for picturesqueness. 

Overlooking Wenham lake, in Beveriy, 
Mass., is a tea-house owned by Mrs. J, 
C. Phillips. It crowns the central por- 
tion of the garden and commands one of 
the finest views to be found in this beau- 
tiful section of the country. It is all en- 
closed in glass, with graceful vines twin- 
ing here and there over the sides and fram- 
ing the windows. It is equally pleasant 
in fine and stormy weather, and was de- 
signed with this in view. The tea-house 
is approached by a stretch of sward, and 
steps on either side lead to a garden above, 
while underneath is a support of stone 
forming a cave where a seat is placed fac- 
ing the fountain. Huge pillars, hand- 
somely carved support the roof, which is 
hexagonal in shape and crowned by a 
weather vane. 

Tea-houses are scattered here and there 
over the large estate of Col A. A. Pope 
at Cohasset, Mass., and they add much 
to the picturesqueness of the grounds. 
One, whose simplicity is its greatest charm, 
nestles in among the trees and shows vistas 
of water and garden below. The beauty

of the view il commands makes it a favor- 
ite retreat, and many youDg people gather 
here during the long summer afternoons. 

The tea-house on the estate of Hon. 
Joseph H. Choate at Siockbridge, Mass., 
is semi-tropical with its abundance of 
palms and profusion of vines covering the 
pillars that support the roof An accada 
tree stands at one side and its branches 
overhang the low roof of the house. It 
commands a view of the English garden 
with its clipped yews and quaint arrange- 
ment of landscape effects. A sweeping 
drive passes in front of the house. 

In many a summer colony tea-houses 
are in evidence. Some are quaintly orien- 
tal in design, others are puritanical in their 
plainness of outline, yet all share in pic- 
turesqueness of position, which is the 
chief charm of a tea house. 

As in Japan we And them overlooking 
rocky bluffs, topping gentle slopes or 
perched on dizzy heights. They are 
nestled with studied carelessness in quiet 



corners of vast estates, none of which 
would be considered perfect without the 
addition of one or more tea-house. Even 
lesser estates receive this addition, and in 
many small gardens a tiny tea-house ef- 
fectively placed serves to enhance beauty 
and to give an appearance of more space 
than is really at the command of the 

There is no more delightful place in 
which to while away an idle hour, and it 
is etjually appreciated by the busy house- 
keeper whose afternoons are occupied in 
mending or making some garment. 

The popularity of teahouses may be 
judged from the remark of a wealthy lady, 
who, when her architect consuhed her 
preference upon a point, said to him, "I 
want seven tea-houses in the gardens, and 
then, it you have time and material, build 
me a house,"

The Vanishing Menu 



By HELEN CAMPBELL 



DID Lucullus, champion gourmand 
of all time, have a fixed order 
of menu, or did he begin with 
ice-cream or rather its Roman prede- 
cessor sherbert cooled with mountain 
snow, and end where he pleased? If 
yearnings for absolute, reckless freedom 
came upon him, as a recent writer tells us 
they descended upon himself and his 
mates who frequented Memorial Hall at 
Harvard, did he like them begin with pud- 
d*ng and insst upon peas or beans for 
dessert, *'just to be free of the horrid 
monotony of feeding by rule ? * ' 

It is at this point that the question 
comes in, where and when did the solemn 
procession begin from hors d'oeurve to 
cafe noir ? We listen to music written in 
fixed lines, the symphony following in its 
construction the rigid law of centuries, 
and then dine on an equally rigidly estab- 
lished form ; or may it be that the tone- 
poem which a daring mind at last evolved 
and so for the time kicked out the sym- 
phony, is the prelude to the same method 
with the menu ? Is there thus to be a 
New Menu, the New Way to Dine? — 
till time has again converted both into the 
case-hardened form which must again be 
shattered, the process to be a continuous 
one down the ages ? 

All this is apropos of a new question, 
another form of the periodical revolution 
which arises for France, This time it is 
a question of soup, so we are told in the 
latest word from a French Medical Asso- 
ciation. Not more soup as one might 
expect from a country with more varieties 
than the rest of the world put together — 
not more, but none at all, in a land where 
soup is, so to speak, indigenous to the 
peasant or artisan, with his morning bowl 
of it with a huge slice of bread, going to 
field or workshop better fortified for the 
day's work, it is said, than any American 



of us all with his sausage and buckwheat 
cakes or chops and hot muffins. In fact, 
not once, but three times a day has been 
practically the law ; the dejeuner a la 
fourchette opening with soup, and the 
evening meal demanding a third edition 
as prelude. In England it is barred out 
at luncheon, but a dinner without it is not 
to be considered. But France rules the 
fashion, is the fashion, and if France in 
the person of her doctors, among the most 
progressive in the world, suddenly frowns 
upon soups, where are we ? 

Louis Quatorze, it is said, demanded 
four varieties served at his table and ate a 
tureen full of each, a statement to be ac- 
cepted with some reservations. Louis 
Philippe also, to whom all old-established 
customs were dear, demanded pot-au-feu, 
practically a soup, the beef and vegetables 
in its make-up served with it, a little after 
the order of the Italian minestra, a thick 
soup, a very savory hodge-podge of meat 
and vegetables 

"Renounce soup, if you would keep 
your figures," the French doctor has pro- 
claimed to his patients, and not alone 
women, but men have listened and re- 
nounced. **No nourishment in it", is 
the word, and we recall the Hke passing of 
beef-tea, once the time-honored, abso- 
lutely-to-be-relied-upon form of nourish- 
ment for the sick till chemistry stepped 
in with its anal3rsis, and the physician 
realized one more blunder to the credit 
of the profession. 

"A stimulant it is true, but merely 
that, no nourishment in it," is the word 
of today, and thus, for the patient at least, 
the New Menu is in full operation. 

It is at this point that the vegetarian 
scores one. Meat-soup, consomme, and 
that order — of course there 's no nouishr- 
ment ! But beans, peas, lentils, made 
savory with onion and other vegetables

and sweet herbs, and rich in proteid? 
Build up the nation on these and you will 
have strong bodies genuinely fed and no 
after-claps, ready to turn into good sol- 
diers at need and bring the percentage 
in the death rates of so many to the thou- 
sand, to the lowest possible mark. This 
is what the French uprising against meat 
soups may be said to summarize, and 
whatever form the New Menu may take, 
at least we are certain that it will be dif- 
ferent from the old one — a simplified if 
no less elegant presentation, but no more 
an inflexible iron rule as to what or how 
shall be the order of the viands served. 

In the meantime the Japanese, prompted 
by their recent famine, have been making 
a study of the food values of roots and 
herbs for emergency cooking, their chem- 
ists having been sent to the famine region 
before the distribution of relief- funds was 
fairly under way, all leaves of trees, vege- 
tation, etc., that the starving people had 
been forced to eat being analyzed. When 
a series of satisfactory conclusions had 
been reached from the many experiments 
patiently tried, the chemists were sent into 
the villages, where they called the people 
together to listen to lectures in which 
suitable roots and leaves were described, 
forms for preparing them as food given, 
and poisonous plants described fuUy for 
the people's protection. "The best- 
managed famine of which the world has 
any record," a Consular report stated, 



the disaster taken advantage of by this 
marvelous people to add to their store of 
knowledge and make the work something 
of permanent value to their country. 

Not one famine sufferer, they deter- 
mined, should be pauperized by their af- 
fliction, a merely temporary happenin<^. 
The tilling of land it was ordered should 
be proceeded with to make secure the 
crop for another season, and in a good 
many cases the ploughing and seeding 
was done by the agents themselves, who 
then turned the land over to the owners 
with injunctions to care for the crop to 
their utmost. Vacant land was also plan- 
ted with crops such as seemed suitable, 
and at every turn the p>eople were en- 
couraged to the utmost to both industry 
and ambition, their chief safeguard against 
future disaster. The hygiene of the dis- 
trict was cared for by both surgeons and 
chemists trained in the late war, and, con- 
trary to all experience in famines in other 
ands, neither dysentery or other pest fol- 
lowed the long period of suffering. Added 
to this was the fact of a new knowledge 
for all, of food at hand, sufficient to pre- 
vent starvation, even if the crop failed 
again, the national menu increased rather 
than diminished in material. For the 
Japanese then the New Menu is already 
there and we look to them for some of 
the new dishes evolved in such Emergency 
Cooking as the world has never before 
seen. 



Fruits by the Wayside 



THE province of Hanover, Germany, 
owns 175,794 fruit-trees planted 
along the sides of 1,976 miles of 
highways. There are pear-, cherry-, plum- 
and apple-trees. Apples are the most 
numerous, and give, upon the whole, the 
best returns. The planting of trees began 
in the early part of the last century. Those 



which are too old to be of service are being 
replaced. But a large part of the high- 
ways thus utilized as orchards have been 
constructed since 1870. The gross income 
from these trees has reached nearly ^40,000 
in a season. The maintenance costs about 
half the average product, which is a little 
over 12 1-2 cents per tree. 



Pots and Kettles 

By KATE GANNETT WELLS 



WHY is it not just as lady-like to 
wash saucepans and their ilk as 
to wash china and glass ! Be- 
cause the former are done at the kitchen sink 
and the latter in the pantry does not neces- 
sarily make the cleansing of granite ware de- 
meaning to one' s self nor to one* s hands. In 
fact, it is often safer to see to one' s pots and 
pans one's self than to trust another to 
brighten them. The safety of the household 
depends on their absolute purity — and skill 
and chemicals can quickly accomplish the de- 
sired results, for cooking utensils represent 
sanitation in its refinements of cleanliness, 
while the condition of the sink is a supreme 
test of good housekeeping. One of the 
proudest of the proud Colonial dames al- 
ways examined her kitchen sink every night, 
so careful was she of her husband's health. 
The washing of dishes reveals conscien- 
tiousness or its lack. See how the children 
in our public schools are taught to do it, the 
top, bottom and edges of the plate are felt 
of by the teacher to ensure their being dry, 
as the little girl stands near, watching anx- 
iously for approval In many high grade 
schools of domestic science the pupils are 
obliged to wear white aprons when working 
in the school kitchen, as reminder of the 
injunction to be spotless even in cooking. 
Consequently they do not bend over when 
stirring the cereal or custard and standing 
straight at all times they do not get round 
shouldered — and so the way of culinary 
cleanliness leads to personal beauty. 

When we contrast the tales of the shin- 
ing pewter of our grandmothers with the 
actual enamel or granite ware of our day, 
we wonder afresh at the aihount of work 
accomplished in no greater allowance of time 
than is ours. Perhaps if we should ever be 
as addicted to the use of copper as they 
were to pewter, we should be as strenuous 
in regard to its brightness. ITie closet un- 
derneath a sink where saucepans can be 



huddled out of sight is responsible for much 
of our shiftlessness. 

Two French proverbs, translated into 
English, read, the first as, *< Men that cook 
in copper know well how difficult is the 
cleaning of copper. All cooking is a double 
labor unless the copper is well tinned," 
and the second runs as *' Carrots, onions, 
lentils and beans depend upon the tinning 
for their worth to mankind ' ' With us it 
is not the tinning but the enameling on 
which depends largely the worth of what is 
cooked, yet oh ! the hard usage that most 
of us give to enamel ware I Why not treat 
it as carefully as one would her enameled 
face or neck ! 

The care of pots and kettles never seems 
more humanizing than when we see them in 
the hands of feeble-minded or defective 
girls, laboriously, eagerly, awkardly learning 
to cook. The classes must be small in 
number, the instruction individual, and the 
acquisition of the art of cooking or cleans- 
ing anything must involve numerous repeti- 
tions. But at last the potato is well boiled, 
the biscuit thoroughly baked and the cook- 
ing utensils hang in line, shining from the 
muscular zeal that has been bestowed upon 
them. It is all pathetic but full of hope. 

One of the present emphases or fads in 
industrial art education is the insistence 
upon more artistic enrichment in objects of 
utility. Yet who would want to buy a 
double boiler enriched by tracery of a Greek 
border, or who would want the figures from 
the Pan-Athenaic procession running round 
a meat pan or a dust pan ! Utility is often 
forgotten in enrichment, and handles and 
covers are designed which are a travesty on 
usefulness. A shape or form is never good 
unless it is suitable for the purjiose for which 
it is made, witness the noses of teapots and 
the mouths of pitchers from which the bev- 
erages pour out in uncertain fashion I 
Strong, plain, easily handled with good

curves, and no hiding places for dust or 
crumbs should be the requisites for any 
cooking dish 6r utensiL 

Our kitchens should reaUy be our labora- 
tories, in which spoons and forks answer to 
us for test tubes, retorts and flasks, and we 
ourselves should be truly experts according 
to our limited lights. It is a very far way 
from ourselves to the wonderful Madame 
Curie, who, after her husband's death be- 
gan her lectures on electricity at the Sor- 
bonne, last November, with the grace of 
unconsciousness and the simplicity of exact 
science. Yet her discoveries and those of 
her husband shine from the radium they 
have given to the world, down to our little 
discoveries of what we can do in our house- 
keeping through the use of electricity. We 
baste the meat in our ovens or move the 
water kettle, lest it boil over, and neither is 
humdrum work, when we think of what 
Madame Curie, a woman like unto us in 
her motherliness, has done for the world. 
Again we baste the meat or watch the jelly, 
thankful that to us our kitchen is a labora- 
tory in which we can work for the little 
world of our home. 

There is something in pots and kettles 
that appeals to the affections. They mean 
the search to find out what our friends like 
to eat ; the victory over tuberculosis and 
anaemic conditions ; the driving away of de- 
pression, often of intemperance ; the sense 
of comradeship and jolly good times, and 
the having always something to do that is 
worth doing. It is no mortification to have 
one's husband or one's children like one 



better because one is mistress of the frying- 
pan. What is a doughnut worth, unless it 
is well fried, and what is home without 
doughnuts and cheese! 

Then there is something in the durability 
and hardness of pots and pans which is 
strengthening to low spirits. The things 
are not going to be broken easily, they will 
last, and that is a comfort compared with 
the fragile nature of cups whose handles 
never stay on. Our ** kitchen goods" 
suggest such cycles of improvement over 
the fire-baked clay dishes of our progeni- 
tors. Our pots and kettles are more real 
than were theirs, as real and permanent al- 
most as our flutiron, the realest kitchen tool 
that we have, which yet is full of sugges- 
tions of poetry, economics and ethics, mak- 
ing the old new and smoothing out the 
rough places, for love and imagination can 
pervade all kitchen work. 

As we iron away, we wish we could lay 
our hands reverentiy on that piece of iron, 
which lately has been found by an iron- 
monger in turning over a heap of scrap- 
iron, John Bunyan's anvil, our co-laborer 
and inspirer over the Slough of Despond into 
the Gate Beautiful Before he wrote his 
Pilgrim's Progress he loved his anvil and 
on it he scratched his right of proprietorship, 
J. Bunyan, Helstow. We may never have 
his dual gift of writing and working, but we 
can have that same sense of enjoyment 
which he had in ownership of his iron anvH, 
if we make our fiatirons, our pots axid 
ketdes, the means by which we piodaoe 
health and happiness for others. 



Love 



By HENR Y VAN D YKE 



Let me but love my love without disguise, 
Nor wear a mask of fashion old or new. 
Nor wait to speak till I can hear a clew. 
Nor play a part to shine in others' eyes. 
Nor bow my knees to what my heart denies ; 
But what I am, to that let me be true, 
And let me worship where my love is due. 



And so through love and worship let me rise. 

For love is but the heart's immortal thirst 
To be completely known and all forgiven. 
Even as sinful souls that enter heaven; 

So take me, dear, and understand my won* t. 
And freely pardon it, because confessed. 
And let me find, in loving thee, my best 



Soap Day in the Second Ward 



Ry LEE McCRAE 



MRS. TRAFFORD had stood it 
just as long as she could. In 
the three years she had lived 
in the Second Ward she had heard, con- 
tinual complaints, slurs, and downright 
dreadful things concerning the school, its 
buildings, grounds, and . management, its 
sanitary conditions, and its moral atmos 
phere. She cared entirely too much for 
the little human life growing up about her, 
the neighbor's children as well as her own, 
to submit tamely and blindly to any pre- 
ventable evil. 

So after a quiet, personal investigation, 
she laid her plans carefully, and started 
by herself on a house to house visitation. 
Not a home, rich or poor, in the whole 
ward was missed, though it took all her 
leisure for a week. At each she refused 
politely to enter, and said with a smile : 

''Can't you come to a meeting of the 
ladies of this ward next Saturday, at the 
school building? We all know the con- 
ditions there, and we want to plan how 
to improve matters. Come and give us 
your advice at least. * ' 

No one so much as guessed that the 
one little woman in gray was the sole 
member of the firm ' * WE. ' ' 

Not all came the next Saturday by any 
means, but far more than she even hoped 
to see. Many were there solely from 
curiosity; some from a genuine sympathy 
with the movement; others were plainly 
belligerent, thinking that the recent 
quarrels among the children were to be 
investigated. But Mrs. Trafford had 
"oil for the. troubled waters" in her 
first sentence: 

"Ladies," she said, **we are here in- 
formally to see for ourselves the condi- 
tions, good and bad, that surround our 
children some six hours a day; to see if 
we are as black as we are painted in repu- 
tation by the other wards of the town; 



and to find out if we mothers can do 
anything to make our childrens' school 
life happier. Suppose we just scatter 
over the building and grounds to see 
what we can see. Then let's gather in 
this room when we have made the rounds. 
Come on, everybody ! Who'll dive into 
the basement with me ? ' ' 

So in and out and up and down they 
went, * * poking their noses into every- 
thing," as the janitor said with a poorly 
suppressed oath. When they reassembled, 
the air was full of wrathy exclamations: 
** Mice in the cloak-rooms ! " 
** And mouldy lunches ! " 
** The walls are awful ! Plastering ready 
to drop." 

* ' Loads of trash in the basement. ' ' 
'* A regular fire- trap ! " 
* * Rooms so dark and gloomy ! * ' 
** The janitor spits tobacco on the land- 
ings" 

**That horrible pump in the back- 
yard ! ' ' 

''And the mud all * round it ! " 
Evidentally No. 2 deserved its reputa- 
tion. With a quiet smile on her face, 
Mrs. Trafford rapped for order. 

" Ladies, we now know for ourselves, 
and I am sure we are agreed that many 
things ought to be done here. What 
shall be our plan of procedure? Sup- 
pose we have a chairman and go about it in 
an orderly way. ' ' 

This met popular approval, and for more 
than an hour they discussed ways and 
means, none shirking either work or re- 
sponsibility, for their eyes were open, and 
all were eager to do things. 

First they planned to secure the nec- 
essary consent of the school-board ; then 
a certain Saturday was set apart as ** house- 
cleaning day," and they divided them- 
selves into companies to look after the 
various rooms, hallways and cloak-rooms, 



368 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



while one large committee was given 
"carte blanche" as yard cleaners, to 
have trees trimmed up and drain pipes 
fixed up as they thought best. 

Of course the old janitor rebelled 
"Uncle Lazybones,** as the children al- 
ways dubbed him, would not stand such 
reflection on his work or such usurpation 
of his authority, and the moment one lady 
objected to the tobacco in the earners, 
he resigned on the spot 

But what a time they had th«t day. 
There was work, plenty of it and harder 
than the majority of these women had 
ever done in their lives, but there was also 
enthusiasm, good-natured rivalry among 
the committees, downright fun, and more 
getting acquainted with neighbors than 
there had been in the whole twelve months 
past And when at last they went from 
room to room surveying each other's work, 
tired i)ut happy, they drew long breaths 
of satisfaction. 

" Won't the children be surprised ! " 
** How it will please the teachers ! '* 
"What an improvement those new 
shades are ! * * were the words echoed and 
re-echoed. 



" Now we must see to getting some 
pictures for the walls," cried one mother 
enthusiastically. 

"And a new chair for the primar}' 
teacher instead of this rickety one," ad- 
ded another neighbor. 

So the work was only begun, not done. 
That winter more mothers visited the 
schoolhouse each month than had been 
there in the previous year ; the children 
and teachers had new incentives for good 
work and even the ward fathers awakened 
sufficiently to realize the unsanitary con- 
ditions about the building and to order im- 
provements that doubtless saved many a 
severe illness. 

" But best of all, to my notion," mur- 
mured the wise little Mrs. Trafford to 
herself, "is the new spirit tha^ has come 
over No. 2. Now that they are inter- 
ested we can begin on moral conditions. 
' Cleanliness is next to godliness ' even in 
a ward school I like the Salvation Army 
motto : ' Soup, Soap, Salvation.' These 
people have had plenty of * soup ' all 
along; now we have applied the 'soap,* 
and next comes — let us hope! — Salva- 
tion. 



Jamie's Opinion 



By GRACE STONE FIELD 



If I were a little boy's mother, 
I know what I would do ; 

I 'd never say "Stop ! " or *« Hush ! " or *• No ! " 
I never would fuss and fidget so, 
When my little boy was noisy, you know ; 
If I were a little boy's mother. 



If I were a little boy's mother. 
He might play cars with the chairs ; 
Or build tall houses with library books 
And stay in the kitchen when Bridget cooks, 
(No matter how bothered Bridget looks) 
If I were a little boy's mother. 



If I were a little boy's mother — 

Oh dear ! My mother said : 

**So many apples are bad for you ; 

Jamie, you mustn't eat more than two." 

And now I know she told me true — 

She always knows best: — my mother. 



Diet in Its Relation to Childhood, Sick- 
ness, and Old Age. 



By MAR V £>. CHAMBERS, 
Third Paper 



Comparison of Human Milk With the Milk of Animals. 



SO much has been said in preceding 
papers regarding the appropriatness 
of milk as a food for the young, that 
it seems well to discuss briefly its composi- 
tion, and the variation in its composition 
and general properties according to its 
source. The comparison will be made 
chiefly between human milk and cow's 
milk, — that of other animals being touched 
on only briefly. 

The proteids in human milk are less in 
quantity, for an equal volume, than in cow's 
milk. A witty physician accounts for this 
by saying, "The calf has to build up more 
beef than the baby." The qusditative 
differences are more remarkable. Casein 
and albumin in human milk occur in about 
equal quantities, — in cow's milk the albu- 
min is present to only about one-sixth to 
one-fourth the amount of the casein. As 
the latter is less readily digested it is not 
surprising to learn that the casein in human 
milk, small in quantity, is thought to be 
entirely absorbed, while that in cow's milk 
leaves a residue hard to be dealt with by 
the delicate digestive organs of the infant 
Other nitrogenous bodies of the nature of 
extractives are more abundant in human 
milk than in cow's, in the ratio of three to 
two. The function of these bodies is little 
understood, but they are supposed in some 
way to stimulate the trophic nerves. 

The fat in human milk contains more 
olein, hence is easier of digestion. There 
is about one-third more sugar in human 
milk than in cow's. 

In cow's milk the mineral salts are present 
to a much larger extent, — but, while in 
human milk 76 per cent, of the phosphorus 



is in organic form, occurring as lecithin and 
phosphocamic acid, in cow's milk the phos- 
phorus is nearly all in inorganic form, hence 
its utilization by the infant is doubtful. 
Scarcely any more important contribution 
to human knowledge, along the line of the 
study of food, has been made than the dis- 
covery of the aU but inutility of many of 
the minerals, — iron, phosphorus, potas- 
sium etc , when administered in inorganic 
form. This is at the bottom of the move- 
ment toward dietetic therapeutics. 

Other differences between human milk 
and cow's milk are that the former is prac- 
tically sterile when taken by the infant, 
while the latter, unless pasteurized or simi- 
larly treated, contains a large number of 
bacteria. Human milk, further, is alkaline 
or neutral, if the mother is in good health ; 
cows' s milk, as on the market, is neutral, 
or slightly acid, — practically never alkaline 
unless unwholsome preservatives are used. 

Regarding the milk of other animals, that 
of the mare most resembles human, though 
it is somewhat less digestible, and is poorer 
in solids, chiefly protein and fat. Asses' 
milk has the least solids of any, is poor in 
casein and fat, but is sweet and easily di- 
gested, though it sometimes promotes a 
laxative bowel condition. Sheep' s milk has 
a large amount of solids, and goat's milk is 
rich in fat and casein, and possesses a strong 
taste owing to the presence of hircin or 
hircic acid This taste is partially expelled 
by boiling. Many physicians consider goat' s 
milk the least digestible of any, and regard 
as a fallacy the prejudice sometimes found 
to exist in its favor, — yet, so unaccounta- 
ble is the personal idiosyncrasy that the 



370 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



writer has known delicate and weakly in- 
fants who could tolerate no other kind, and 
throve on this. 

The necessity for the modification of 
cow's milk will be clear from the foregoing. 
Water is added to dilute the proteids, but 
when these are made quantitatively equal 
to the proteids in human milk, the fats are 
deficient, and have to be made up by the 
addition of creant The sugar added, for 
a like reason, should preferably be sugar of 
milk or lactose, as this does not readily fer- 
ment Lime water is often added to restore 
alkalinity, and some form of sterilization is 
generally practiced. Notwithstanding all 
this, the best modified milk is a poor sub- 
stitute for the milk of the healthy mother, 
provided by nature and wonderfully adapted 
to aid in nature's most important function, 
— the propagation of the race. Any mother 
needlessly refusing this nutriment to her 
child is doing it an injustice which is fre- 
quently irreparable. 

The Nursing Mother. 

Before leaving the subject of infancy, and 
proceeding to our next topic, — the care of 
the child during the first years of school 
life, — it may not be amiss to consider 
briefly the care and diet of the nursing 
mother as a factor in the nutrition of the 
child. 

The chief object of such care will be to 
promote a sufficient secretion of healthy 
milk, and, with this intent, to adopt such 
a regime as may prevent constipation, in- 
digestion, loss in weight, anaemia, flatu- 
lency, etc. 

ITie diet, therefore, should contain 
abundance of fluids, gruels, meat broths, 
cocoa, chocolate, milk. Otherwise, a 
mixed diet of simple dishes, e. g., meat, 
eggs, vegetables, fruits. The latter, even 
if acid, react favorably upon the child, keep- 
ing the bowels open, provided the mother' s 
digestion is good. Rich made dishes are 
to be avoided, also condiments and spices, 
tea and coffee, and all alcoholic drinks, — 
since these are nerve irritants, and may 
even cause a predisposition for a like 
craving on the part of the child. 



Common errors in the diet of the nurs- 
ing mother are, first : excess of proteid, 
which tends to increase of uric acid in the 
blood, and, moreover, curiously enough, 
results in an increase of fat in the milk. 
Excess of fat is apt to cause biliousness, 
and will often interfere with the healthy 
metabolism whereby the nutrients of the 
milk are maintained in good proportion. 
Excess of carbohydrates tends to ang.mia, 
A purely vegetarian diet is said to cause 
flatulency, and to give watery milk. The 
use of lemonade in warm weather is to be 
adapted to the individual constitution. 
The citric acid of the lemons is believed to 
result, in the body, in the evolution of 
COs, tending, it is true, to alkalinity of the 
blood, but depriving it of oxygen, thus leav- 
ing less to oxidize the tissues. As less heat 
is thus produced the cooling effect of lem- 
onade in warm weather is accounted for. 

Other points of special importance are 
the use of cold bathing, rubbing of the body, 
and other agencies to promote circulation. 
The clothing should be loose and light, and 
in cool weather special attention should be 
given to protection of the nerve centres at 
the back of the neck and the chest, also to 
warm and dry foot covering. 

The mother at this time should be re- 
lieved from all mental strain and anxiety, 
and should exercise her own will in pre- 
serving an equable and happyitemperament, 
without nervous excitement Not only 
may she hope to transmit this valuable heri- 
tage to her child, but even in the matter of 
physical health, tranquility and joy are 
wonderful agents in bodily well-being. It 
has been demonstrated by experiment that 
the secretions of the body are abnormally 
changed by a fit of depression or an ebulli- 
tion of ill temper. 

A sufficient amount of exercise every 
day, preferably in the open air, is of the 
utmost importance to the mother. The 
troublesome colic in infants, proceeding 
from indigestible proteids in the food, is 
Irequendy caused by lack of exerdse on the 
part of the mother. A friend, in corrobora- 
tion of this, told me the following story : 
Virginia was the first baby in her sister's 



DISH WASHING

family, and Virginia's father and grand- 
mother and aunt all feared that the winds 
of heaven might blow too roughly on Vir- 
ginia' s mother. She was supported from 
her couch to her chair, and carried up and 
and down stairs, and if she dropped her 
handkerchief she was not allowed to pick 
it up. Then Virginia began to have colic 
at night and testified to the same with vig- 
orous young lungs and a fine disregard for 
the peace of the family. So the father 
and grandmother and aunt took turns in 
walking the floor with Virginia, and every 
night she became more emphatic in declar- 
ing her malaise, and her relatives had to 



walk with her for longer and longer — until 
at last her mother could endure it no more. 
"Give her to me," she cried one night 
when every one was too exhausted to pro- 
test against the over-exertion, "Give her 
to me, I know I can manage her." So 
she did, but not until she had walked at 
least two miles in the nursery. Next day 
the mother felt no ill efifects, and next night 
Virginia slept like an angeL And on re- 
lating the wonder to a friend of the family 
who had taken a course of lessons in the 
care of babies and babies' mothers, Vir- 
ginia's mother was told the reason 
why. 



To Arcadee 



By ALIX THORN. 



She asked the way to Arcadee, 
A timid, gray-eyed lass, 

The busy folk all hurried on. 
She sadly watched them pass. 

A sturdy lad came singing by, 
For Spring was in the land, 

He knew the way to Arcadee, 
And clasped her slender hand. 



** We two will seek it down this lane 

Where lilies are ablow," 
He whispered, **or across this rill — 

Ah, many paths I know." 

"The greening woods, the breezy down. 

The meadow wide and free. 
Though East, though West, though North or South 

All lead to Arcadee. 



'Tis easy found by lad and lass. 
Who wander hand in hand 

A weary search alone," he cried. 
And Spring was in the land. 



Dish Washing. 



By DORA MA Y MORRELL. 



THE rawest recruit to the ranks 
of domestic service will feel ag- 
grieved, if it be suggested to her 
that she may not know how to wash dishes ; 
and it is generally supposed by those who 
do it that washinsr dishes is not much of an 



accomplishment, and perhaps it is not, but 
we who have dishes sticky to the fingers, 
though served for food, sometimes think it 
doubtful if as much is known of the art as 
might be. In old times dish-washing was 
rather a daintv piece of work. The fine 



37-' 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



ware was not trusted to general servants 
and never left the dining-room and its 
closets. After the meal a small wooden 
tub was brought into the dining-room on a 
sort of large tray, and the mistress of the 
house herself, gave her fine and pretty 
dishes their cleansing bath. Those were 
the days when china descended from gen- 
eration to generation, because it was washed 
by the hands of those who appreciated it 
well enough to give it the tender handling 
which was its due. Ladies no longer take 
this interest in their belongings nor do they 
pass on to their assistants the knowledge, 
given them by their careful mothers, of how 
to treat different wares. 

Dish-washing, whichprobably is themost 
disliked of all household tasks, may be made 
a very pleasant piece of work by proper 
preparation. There should be a generous 
supply of toweb, and it is best never to use 
a dish-towel more than once without re- 
laundrying. That does away with any 
chance of past dish-water being in it 
There should be more than one kind of 
wiping cloths to be used according to the 
nature of the dishes. Soft glass toweling 
for the glass, and linen crash for the other 
pieces will be all that is needed. For 
washing, there should be a mop to be used 
on deep articles, a soft doth for fine ware, 
a heavy cloth for ordinary dishes, and a 
wire dish-cloth for iron ware or cooking 
utensils. Of course there will be plenty of 
hot water, and then with good soap, am- 
monia or borax, if the water is hard, and 
with two pans, one for the washing and the 
other for rinsing, everything is ready when 
the dishes are. 

Three-fourths of proper dish-washing lies 
in getting the things ready. Plates should 
be scraped free from grease and bits of 
food ; all dishes should be made as clean, 
in the same manner, as possible, for there 
is nothing much more disgusting than the 
sight of a dishpan filled with nasty water 
with crumbs on the surface. So far as 
health is concerned it would be better to 
eat from dishes, unwashed, than to take 
them from such supposed-to-be cleaning as 
they too often get. Plates of the same 



kind should be piled together, saucers laid 
in their own heap, and so on, things of the 
same kind together. 

For the washing, fill the pan half full of 
pleasantly warm water into which you have 
put a little ammonia. Omit soap, when 
you wash glasses, but let borax or ammonia 
serve in its stead. If the tumblers have 
held milk or other liquids than water, rinse 
with cold before putting into the warm 
water. If a tumbler that is milky is put at 
once into hot water, it will never be clear 
again. Wipe the glasses without letting 
them drain from the water, as that is apt 
to make streaks on the glass. The wipers 
should be fresh from the laundry, and the 
glass is not properly wiped, if there be the 
suggestion of dullness or of lint Glass 
should shine and feel smooth to the fingers. 
Cut glass often needs a special brush, soft 
and firm enough to go into all the lines of 
cutting. Cut glass can not be kept clean 
by ordinary washing. Glasses with gilding 
should be wiped from rather cool water, and 
never be left to stand in it, each piece being 
finished before the next is dampened. 

Fine china is quite as delicate as glass, 
and often cracks when hot water is poured 
upon it, so it is much better to begin with 
tepid waler. Once the dishes are covered 
with water the temperature may be raised 
gradually by the addition of hot water. 

After the glass is washed, into the dish- 
water place the cups and saucers. Take 
these before the silver, because that often 
is greasy and therefore not to be washed, 
until after the cleaner things are out of the 
way. As the cups, et cetera, are washed 
place them into the rinsing-pan and then 
turn clean, hot water over them. Of course 
for these you have added soap to the water, 
and you want all the suds well rinsed 
away. 

Now let the silver come, as the first of 
the greasy things. If the water is not clean, 
turn it out and start with fresh. Dishes 
should never be put into dirty water, though 
fresh is added half a dozen times before the 
task is done. Silver will not need rubbing 
nearly as often, if it be washed daily in hot 
water to which borax has been added It 



DISH WASHING

should not stand to drain but be wiped as 
soon as taken from the water. Newspaper 
will be found to put a real polish on silver, 
though you will not want to try it on your 
spoons or any other article that comes in 
contact with the food or your mouth, as 
you do not know what the paper may have 
lurking within. 

Next in order will be the plates and after 
these the serving dishes, and for all of these 
the modus operandi is the same, washing in 
the dish-pan and rinsing in the other with 
good hot water. All of these will feel like 
highly polished articles, provided the cloths 
for wiping have been clean and dry and the 
rinsing water has been hot, though it need 
not be hotter than the hand can easily bear. 
Damp wiping cloths are responsible for 
most of the untidy dishes that poor human 
beings have to submit to. Some fine house- 
keepers do not have the dishes wiped at 
all, and the same is true of some of the 
best hotels. The dishes as washed are set 
into wire drainers or baskets so that they 
do not touch, and then the basket with its 
contents is plunged into a kettle of hot 
water. The dishes will be shining, when 
they are lifted from their bath, and are left 
to drain as they stand, and the surface is 
so hot that the little water which is on 
them quickly dries away. This method is 
not a safe one to try on the thinnest china, 
as it may break, if the water be very hot 

Since agate ware has taken the place 
once filled by heavy, iron pots and pans, it 
is not so difficult to make them clean, 
though this is the most disagreeable part 
of the work, but in this too, the proper 
preparation will take half the distasteful- 
ness from it The greasy pans should be 



set on the stove with water and a little soda 
in them. After ten minutes of this the 
grease will turn off; it really forms with the 
soda a kind of soap and, after soaking in 
this way, the pan will wash easily. Brown 
stains that come on baking dishes and cus- 
tard-cups will vanish when rubbed with salt 
All the cooking dishes should be filled with 
cold water as soon as they are emptied. 
Even such things as oatmeal will be re- 
moved by such treatment, and scarcely 
need the aid of the wire dish-cloth. When 
you have let something burn on to a dish 
so that it is black and ruined, you think, 
you will find that it will lose the blackness, 
if you fill it with water, to which you add 
lye or considerable soda. After it stands 
for a while the burnt matter will be eaten 
off by the lye and then the dish looks as 
good as new. Never take the same cloth 
for the kettles and pans that you have used 
for the glass and china. It does not make 
any difference that one is as clean as the 
other, but fine dishes require soft cloths 
to keep them in good condition. 

When the dishes are washed, thfen put 
all the cloths through a wash, and hang 
them to dry. Hang them out straight in 
the air where the sunlight may sweeten 
them. It is not possible to keep a dish- 
cloth wholesome for use about dishes un- 
less it be thus treated. Hung up in a wad 
or left in one, in the dish-pan, it becomes 
sour, sticky and dangerous. Typhoid fever 
and other diseases often have found a 
breeding field in a wet, nasty dish-cloth, 
which is quite as likely to be found in the 
kitchen of the rich as of the poor; so take 
thought for the way the dishes are washed 
and thus find health and comfort 




The Only Cure for Spring Fever 



By LEE McCRAE. 



HUMAN nature doctors always di- 
agnose our cases of spring fever 
as ''pure laziness," but it is a 
rank injustice to us and a piece of pessi- 
mism on their part 

For laziness is a spirit of reluctance, a 
downright repugnance to anything that re- 
sembles work, while this spring-time fever 
is the result of a fight between the mental 
and physical It is a case of the spirit 
being willing when the flesh is weak and 
lethaigic. Let us put the blame where it 
belongs. 

The desire for activity floods one's whole 
brain with the coming of seed time. Who 
does not wake up in March ? — if it be but 
to dream of planting onions ! Indeed, hs 
is hopelessly old or stupid who does not 
feel ambition creeping through his veins 
when the sap creeps through the trees. 

But winter habits hang upon us, the 
balls and chains of our imprisonment 
When the nights were long, we learned to 
sleep several hours more than we did in 
July. Now, when the birds sing and awake 
us at five o'clock, our slothful old bodies 
stretch out with the cry, **A little more 
sleep, a little more slumber, a little more 
folding of the hands to sleep. ' * The brain 
says peremptorily, ** Get up ! " The arms 
answer, ** I don't want to," and the limbs 
say, "I won't !" 

And finally one is up and out, breathing 
the new-made air, ( there is aspiration in 
respiration now ) he hates his stuffy office, 
shop or store. He wishes he could pull 
off his high collar and shoes and stockings, 
and go bare-footed for half an hour — 
where no one could see him. Such are 
some of the acute symptoms. 

The only remedy worth trying is to take 
in all the fresh air one can, and set about 
carrying out the large plans we drew while 
we poked the coal in January. Let us 
heave great sighs of relief that the long, 



unusually severe (it is always ''unusually 
severe ! " ) winter is over, thus realizing the 
truth whidi Emerson proclaimed : '' There 
is no thankfulness like that of relief." 

If we do this, our imprisonment will not 
have been an unmixed evil, for we gad-about 
Americans ought to be locked in our homes 
at least one month in the year. Curtains 
of snow and smoke have come down, shut- 
ting out the world-worries, and shutting us 
in to that which is nearest and should be 
dearest Then he only is happy who finds 
his heart within his home. At no time in 
the year does home mean so much to us, as 
when we are driven in by the friendlessness 
of the elements and the unfriendliness of 
the buttoned-up, self-centered people who 
hurry by in the streets. When the ther- 
mometer drops until its chin rests on the 
zero shelf, how our chairs gravitate toward 
the grate and each other I In base-ball 
parlance, it is wamatCs inning when man 
makes a home run, 

. But this opportunity is gone. ' ' All past 
things are in the angels' keeping" — poor 
things I Now woman can hold her own in 
the game only by letting the spring warmth 
and cheer into the house. How often do 
we come indoors from the genial sunshine 
to find the rooms dark and clammy, the 
home-maker hugging the fire as in the 
weeks gone by. It is actually warmer out- 
side and a hundred times cheerier ; but she 
has not been out and does not realize it 

This is the time to roll up the shades, 
throw open all the shutters and doors, and 
let in not only the sun but the new courage 
and aspiration that comes to the individual 
life as the warmth comes to the earth-cov- 
ered seeds. Let all the preachers preach 
from the text, ** Forgetting the things which 
are behind. ' ' Let the business- tied men slip 
their knots and go for a drive or walk in 
the country. Let the children have a sand 
pOe to dig in, while the mothers bring their

rocking-chairs and sewing out upon the 
porches. So shall the breezes of heaven, 
literally and figuratively, blow through all 



our homes, fanning into blossom and fruit 
the dormant ambitions of the winter- 
time. 



With the Help of a Brother. 



By ALEX THORN. 



SHE had the grace to blush as she 
wrote it, yet write it she did, in her 
unique hand, plainly, and with very 
long tails to her y*s and g's : — 

Dkae Old Bob: 

See, here, don't think me quite daft — will 
you ? I'm sending this because of a remark made 
by our beloved Aunt Charlotte the other evening 
at dinner. She glanced across the festive board 
at me and remaiked, ** It's a pity, Marion, you 
did n't secure John Bainbridge that summer you 
visited me. He's just been taken into that Chi- 
cago firm, and is, no doubt, a rising lawyer. 

Now, Bob,>'M# were with me that summer in 
the East, and knew all How I met him^ I mean 
John Bainbridge, toward the end of my visit. 
And we did hit it off well ; he truly liked me, but 
just as soon as it began to get interesting he had 
to go in one direction, and I in another. An3rway, 
to get down to business, I want you. Bob, to write 
him a nice, man noU^ and just ask him in off-hand 
fashion to look up your people, as they live near 
Chicago, when he comes to that great, wicked 
city. Brother, the years are flying — too many of 
them have flown. As you are strong be merdfuL 

Devotedly your sister, 
Marion De Puyster Allen. 

The day after she had sent the letter. Bob' s 
sister decided that it was really very queer 
of her to write it Bob and Mr. Bainbridge 
had not been such devoted friends, which 
was hardly strange considering there was 
quite eight years difference in their ages. 
True, they had met at long intervals since, 
but — even that — 

Two days later she told herself that she 
was not sorry she did it, and she did not 
care who disagreed with her. Most girls fol- 
lowed up their men friends far more than 
ahe ever did, and ever should, in fact 

Three days later found her in a cosy 
comer of the couch, thinking up her cam- 
paign. 



Five years before she had made the 
memorable. Eastern visit, and what a car- 
nival of fun it was. She smiled as she re- 
membered those mad, merry times. Happy 
days spent on lake and river ;long walks in 
the bracing air ; jolly little dances and ex- 
cursions. How far away the prosaic things 
of life seemed then. Aunt Charlotte was a 
good hostess inviting many men to meet 
her presentable niece. They had come 
again and again, and she had taken them 
more or less lightly. One evening a grave- 
faced young lawyer had joined the circle, 
John Bainbridge, more sincere, if more shy 
than the others, and entered earnestly into 
his share of entertaining the guest of honor. 
She had missed him very much when she 
was called suddenly away, but then the 
world was all before her, and many were 
willing to take his place. Had she changed 
very much? Her hair was certainly as 
wavy, and held as many golden lights — 
eyes faded only when one grew old and 
weary ; hers were large and brown as five 
years before. 

Twenty-two was fairer than twenty-seven, 
and had a prettier fashion of flushing sud- 
denly — her figure was still slight — she was 
fully as athletic. 

If he should possibly come, of course he 
might very easily not — this last with — 
decision — what should she wear? She 
always looked well in a white doth, whose 
generous sweep comforted her soul, and 
whose long lines showed her figure to ad- 
vantage. She could see herself coming 
down the winding stairs with a soft frou-frou 
of frilly petticoats, gliding in stately fashion 
through the dim, old haU. A slhn figure

. THE GREATEST OF TABLE- 
TALKERS. 

THE happy influence of cheerful 
conversation at meals is well 
known. At the dinner-table the 
brightest and wittiest sayings have been 
spoken. Dr. Johnson was at his best after 
eating, and drinking tea, of which he was 
very fond. His table-talk, as reported by 
Boswell, is more interesting and fascinating 
by far than any of his heavy and sedate 
compositions. Table-talk is called the su- 
preme flower of civilization. 

Strange as it may seem, Bishop Hendrix, 
in The Homiletic Review, says, ** Christ 
was a teacher who loved to talk at the feast 
and the family meal Of Confucius, his 
disciples said, ' While at table he did not 
converse,* but the contrary was the case 
with the founder of Christianity. * He eat- 



eth and drinketh with publicans and sin- 
ners,' was the charge bronght against hint 
He not only accepted all invitations to dine, 
but was sometimes a self-invited guest 
He gladly took his place in the center of 
that world where seriousness is usually lost 
amid a congenial company at the table, and 
found and taught there the true solemnity 
of living. ' ' 

Bishop Hendrix continues : ''Thesavage 
eats alone because he has nothing to say. 
Why expect table-talk firom one who has no 
sympathy with his kind, no thoughts to 
share, no exchange of ideas ? Can we ex- 
pect the table to be a clearing-house where 
there is no currency, no medium of ex- 
change, where speech is scant because ideas 
are few ? The savage munches his bone in 
silence, as he simply eats to live. Man is 
already advanced well in civilization when he 
talks while he eats. . . . Man's table- 
talk tells with rare accuracy the measure of 
his civilization or enlightenment He is well 
advanced when he abandons his savage 
tendencies to discuss his enemies at the 
table and begins to talk of things. And he 
has become a thinker when he talks more 
of ideas than of things. He is at his best 
when he is fitted to enjoy and to share such 
table-talk as our Lord gave in his dinner 
parables, or at the Last supper. 

''Nothing, next to the very passion of our 
Lord, has so brought about this change in our 
humanity as his intimate personal contact 
with men, as he was alternately their host 
and their guest What tables Christ spread 
for men as he fed now Ave thousand and 
now four thousand in the wilderness ; and 
what access did he get to the hearts of the 
fishermen-aposdes as he told them where 
to cast their nets, and then ate with them 
on the shore or in their homes. What new 
meaning had life to Zaccheus after our Lord 
was once his guest and drew open the cur- 
tains of the kingdom of heaven in his table- 
talk ! What new views of both earth and 
heaven did Christ give men in his parables 
of the Great Supper and the wedding gar- 
ment, which he spake as he reclined at 
meat 1 Who could ever forget the parable 
of the two debtors which he spake in the

house of Simon the loveless, as the weeping 
woman bathed his feet with her tears as he 
talked and ate, the crumbs of his conversa- 
tion being to her as angels' food ? ' ' 



BERNARD SHAW»S RELIGION. 

ACCORDING to report, Bernard 
Shaw, the dramatist, regards re- 
ligion as the most ''interesting 
thing in the world." On invitation Mr. 
Shaw recentiy occupied the pulpit of the 
most influential Congregational church in 
England, and in his discourse he gives his 
definition of a religious man, as "the man 
who has a constant sense, amounting on his 
part to a positive knowledge, that he is only 
the instrument of a Power, which is a Uni- 
versal Power, the Power that created the 
universe and brought it into being ; that he 
is not in the world for his own narrow pur- 
poses, but that he is the instrument of that 
Power," and the lecturer went on to say: 
**If you don't do His work it won't be 
done ; if you turn away from it, if you sit 
down and say, 'Thy will be done,' you 
might as well be the most irreligious person 
on the face of the earth. But if you will stand 
by your God, if you will say, ' My business 
is to do Your will, my hands are Your hands, 
my tongue is Your tongue, my brain is Your 
brain, I am here to do Thy work, and I will 
do it,' you will get rid of other worldliness, 
you will get rid of all that religion which 
is made an excuse and a cloak for doing 
nothing, and you will learn not only to wor- 
ship your God, but also to have a fellow- 
feeling with Him. 

' ' This conception that I am doing God' s 
work in the world gives me a certain self- 
satisfaction — not with the limitations of my 
power and the extravagances of my brain or 
hand — but a certain self-respect and force 
in the world. People like their religion to 
be what they call comforting. I want my 
religion to give me self-respect and courage, 
and I can do without comfort, without hap- 
piness, without everything else. This sort of 
faith really overcomes the power of death. ' ' 
Thus the work we do is to be regarded 
as the main thing in life. This conception 
of work, i. e. , intense interest in the work 



we are doing, is what we want to emphasize. 
Where else can self-respect and courage be 
found save in the character of the work we 
do ? No matter how humble the occupa- 
tion in which we are engaged, the idea ever 
present that we are instruments of the Un- 
seen Power, and are executing His will in 
the world, is encouraging. The very 
thought is inspiring. 

And yet of the true spirit and courage to 
do, how many are in constant need. Let 
us be convinced ; the earnest life is the only 
life worth living. Whatever our calling or 
task may be, however humble or exalted in 
station, it is our work, and in the doing our 
aim should be to win no less an approval 
than that of "well done." 



SENTIMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY IN 

DIET. 

TWO great questions have to be con- 
sidered in thinking out the'diet of 
human kind, according to that em- 
inent student of the subject. Dr. Josiah 
Oldfield. There is the physiological prob- 
lem, he says, of what will nourish the body 
cells, and there is the interlinked mental 
problem of what will satisfy the esthetic 
nature. 

Most writers on diet ignore this latter 
problem. They are quite satisfied to talk 
about tables of nutrition and percentages 
of nitrogen and carbon, as if these compre- 
hended the diet question. Those, how- 
ever, who have studied human beings as 
living personalities, have discovered that 
sentiment plays a most important part in 
diet The influence of sentiment on diet 
is increasing with the evolution of higher 
art and higher ethics. 

Men in the medical profession are con- 
stantly faced with sentiment set on edge. 
Physicians are often taxed to the uttermost 
to harmonize the physiological food which 
they want to prescribe and the sentimental 
objection to it to which patients most 
acutely manifest. There is the common 
illustration which every one meets a thou- 
sand times in a lifetime, of the girl whose 
functions need much fat but whose stomach 
rebels at the verv thought of fat meat.

and threats and penalties. But nothing 
can overcome the artistic development in 
the girPs nature, which makes her revolt at 
the bare idea of putting the fet piece of a 
dead animal between her lips. 

But since it is fat that is needed, and not 
fat meat, the antagonism that exists be- 
tween physiological needs and artistic senti- 
ment is got over by those who are endowed 
with sufficient common sense by obtaining 
the fat meat from a non-meaty source. 
Again and again Dr. Oldfield affirms he 
has said to a patient : "Now, what you 
want is more fat You must take plenty of 
fat** **0h, but doctor," is so oflen the 
answer, ' * I can* t bear fet ' * ' * Don* t you 
Uke butter ? * * Dr. Oldfield replies. ' * Oh, 
yes, I like butter. * * * ' Well, is the rejoinder, 
**did you ever see any lean butter?** 
**Oh, no, but I thought you meant fat 
meat * * Dr. Oldfield proceeds : 

** There is no doubt about it, the ten- 
dency of an advancing evolution is to war 
out the ferocity of the tiger and the vacu- 
ous imitativeness of the ape, and let the 
grace of the angel live. 

**This law holds as good of food as it 
does of all other fields of human activity. 
We are, therefore, perforce, driven to face 
the problem of evolution in dietary, and to 
ask ourselves in what direction and on what 
lines this evolution tends. To me, the de- 
velopment of humaneness and esthetics 
necessarily makes for an increasing bias 
towards a humane and esthetic dietary. 

After a quarter of a century's study of 
diet, my opinion is that the future lies with 
the fruitarian, and that the practice of flesh- 
eating will become more and more relegated 
to the lower classes and to the unimagina- 
tive-minded. * * — Current Literature,

PHILOSOPHIC ADVICE 

I PRAY you, O excellent wife, not to 
cumber yourself and me to get a ridi 
dinner for this man or this woman 
who has alighted at our gate, nor a bed- 
chamber made ready at too great a cost 
These things, if they arc curious in, they 
can get for a dollar at any village. But kt 
this stranger, if he will, in your looks, in 
your accent and behavior rea4 your heart 
and earnestness, your thought and will, 
which he can not buy at any price in any 
village or city. Certainly let the board be 
spread and let the bed be dressed for the 
traveler; but let not the emphasis of hos- 
pitality lie in these things. Honor to the 
house where they are simple to the veige 
of hardship, so that there the intellect is 
awake and reads the laws of the uniyeise' 
the soul worships truth and love, honor 
and courtesy flow into all deeds. — Emersom, 



CITY COMRADESHIP. 
By Anna Louise Strong. 

Face on face in the city, and when will the faces 

end? 
Face on face in the city, but never the face of a 

friend ; 
' Till my heart grows sick with longing and dazed 

with the din of the street. 
As I rush with the thronging thousands in a 

loneliness complete. 

Shall I not know my brothers ? Their toil is one 

with mine. 
We offer the fruits of our labor on the same great 

city's shrine. 
They are weary as I am weary ; they are bappy 

and sad with me ; 
And all of us laugh together when evening sets 

us free. 



Face on face in the city, and where shall our for- 
tunes fall ? 

Face on face in the city, — my heart goes out to 
you all. 

See, we labor together ; is not the bond divine ? 

Lo, the strength of the city is built of your life 
and mine. — Selected.

Anchovy-and-Egg Canapes 
Cut bread, freed from crust, one-tliird 
an inch thick and two inches square. Toast 
these to a golden brown, ror six canapes 
have six anchovies (those preserved in oil 
are best) and one hard-cooked egg. Chop 
very fine the white of the egg. Pick the 
flesh of the anchovies very fine; chop fine 
three pimolasandatablespoonfulofcapers. 
Mix the anchovies, white of egg, pimolas 
and capers with enough mayonnaise dress- 
ing (or use simply oil and lemon juice) to 
hold them together. Spread the mixture 
on the toa.it, sift over it the cooked yolk of 
egg and add three or four capers on the 
edge. Serve as an appetizer before the 
soup at luncheon or dinner. 

Consomnie with Poached Eggs 

Heat a pint of consommfi to the boiling 
point and break into it two or three fresh 
e^s; let the dish stand on top of the range 
or in the oven, where the soup will not 
boil, until the egg is lightly set through- 
out, then remove with a skimmer to a plate 



of consommi. The soup and egg with 
bread sticks or pulled bread make a nu- 
tritious and easily digested luncheon or sup- 
per dish. 

Gratinated Crusts (Served with 

Soup) 

Bake yeast rolls of oval shape some dis- 
tance apart, to keep them crusty on all sides. 
When baked rasp or grate off the shiny 
crust on a lemon grater, then pull out the 
soft interior, to leave a crusty shell. Dip 
each in consommfe or broth and set into the 
oven, hollow side up, on a buttered agate 
plate ; let dry in a moderate oven, then-turn 
the crusts to have the rounding side upper- 
most; baste them with clarified chicken fat, 
or top of the soup kettle or melted butter, 
and return them to the oven; baste with 
the fal twice more and let the crusts remain 
in the oven until they are dry and crisp. 
Serve hot with soup. These are the crusts 
commonly served with the soup designated 
as " Croute au pot," The soup is an un-

Eggs with Cream in Ramequins 
Butter ramequins holding one, two or 
three eggs as desired. For three eggs scald 
a scant half a cup of thin cream or rich 
milk. Scald the milk in the ramequin or 
use a saucepan and turn the milk into the 
ramequin. Break in three eggs, sprinkle a 
few grains of salt over the whites and set 
the dish into a moderate oven. If the dish 
is raised on little feet from the bottom of 
the oven, it may go direcdy into the oven.

rind of an orange and one-fourth a cup of 
fine-chopped citron. Break one egg and 
the yolk or white of another into the mix-

tract and mix the whole to a stiff dough. 
With buttered hands roll the mixture into 
balls about the size of hickory nuts, dip 
one side in granulated sugar and set some 
distance apart in buttered pans, the sugared 
side up. Bake in a quick oven. The 
recipe makes eighteen macaroons. 

Cooking in Crockery Ware 

Most articles of food cooked in earthern 



ware are served from the dish in which the 
cooking is done ; by this means dish-wash- 
ing is lessened and food that is at its best 
when served hot is not cooled in transit 
from the stove to the dining-table. Indeed, 
so well does earthern ware retain its heat 
that even the late-comer or those desiring 
a second helping may be served hot food. 
Of course crockery is better adapted to 
some cooking processes than to others. 
Such ware, even if it be extremely hard- 
baked and fine-polished, must from neces- 
sity be heated gradually ; thus it is not suit- 
able for pan-boiling, saut^ing and other 
ways of cooking that demand a quick 
strong heat Earthern ware is called for 
when fibrous substances are to be made 
tender by long, slow cooking. When it is 
desirable to retain juices in meats, etc., 
they may be browned and seared over in 
a frying-pan and then set to cook in the 
earthern dish. 

Let the heat be assimilated by the dish 
graduaUy and there need be no fear of 
breakage from overheating, and the but- 
tered crumbs spread over creamed-and 
scalloped dishes may be browned to the 
queen's taste. When cooking meats in a 
casserole let the liquid with which the dish 
is to be replenished be hot, for turning a 
cold liquid into a hot dish would cause it 
to crackle if not to crack outright If the 
oven be very hot, it is well to set ramequins 
holding eggs, which call for delicate cook- 
ing, on several folds of paper, in a dish of 
hot water. Let all casserole cookery and 
the cooking of dried fruits, on the top of 
the range, in earthen vessels, be done at 
the simmering rather than the boiling point, 
and in carefully closed dishes, thus the 
flavor of the viand is retained, tenderness 
of fibre is secured and the value of both 
the food and cooking utensil is kept in- 
tact. For scalloped oysters, select a shal- 
low rather than a deep dish, thus securing 
lightness of the crumbs and a short period 
in the oven. All au gratin dishes are prob- 
ably served at their best in shallow recep- 
tacles, but, in the cooking of oysters, 
this is a matter of considerable impor- 
tance.

JANET M. HILL. 



El Paso, Texas, July i8, 1906. 

Dear Editor : — " We are a family of 
two and employ a cook, but I would rather 
do the cooking myself, if I knew how. I 
would like to take a. course in cooking, by 
mail, beginning with elementary principles, 
and having the course so arranged that I 
might learn to cook and at the same time 
utilize the articles cooked on our table." 

It did not seem feasible to give this one 
woman lessons by mail, when undoubtedly 
there were many others of our subscribers 
w^io would profit by such teaching. Thus 
we promised to begin — early in the new 
year, a course of twelve lessons in elemen- 
tary cookery such as might satisfy the re- 
quirements of this and other similarly sit- 
uated readers. 

For the present the space devoted to 
" The After Breakfast Chat" will be given 
to these lessons. From necessity the half 
tones illustrating the text must be presented 
on the pages of "Seasonable Recipes." 

To stimulate thought in connection with 
these lessons, a part of each lesson will be 
in the form of questions, to which sub- 
scribers may send answers for correction 
and su^estion, enclosing stamps to cover 
postage. In sending replies do not repeat 
the questions. Set the answer against a 
number corresponding to the number of 
the question and mail to Editor of the 
Boston Cooking School Magazine. 
LESSON I. 
A Talk on Food. 

In the morning you work about the 
house, putting it in order, or you work in 
the garden with your flowers, or you go to 
market. Your husband attends to his work 



out-of-doors or in the office, and when 
mid-day is reached neither of you fee! will- 
ing to do any more work, until you have 
eaten your mid-day meal Your enei^ 

and motive power are gone. The move- 
ments you have made, not only those you 
have made of your own accord in working 
about the house, but also those made in- 
voluntarily by your heart in beating, your 
lungs in breathing, and your brain in think- 
ing, have wasted your stock of energy and 
worn away tissues of flesh, blood and bones. 
This waste must be renewed at once, or 
you will remain faint and inactive ; or, if 
the renewal be deferred for days, you will 
cease to live. More than this, if you have 
not attained your full normal growth, there 
must be a constant supply of material for 
this purpose. The material to renew en- 
ergy and tissues and supply new growth 
comes from the food that is eaten. Not 
all the artices that we use as food contain 
elements for growth and repair of tissues ; 
from this fact you can see that, if those 
whom you send from your tables each day, 
have not been supplied with the proper 
articles of food, you can not expect them 
to retain health or have the energy and 
courage to do their work in thi^ world. An 
old saying expresses this in concise form, 
which you can easily remember ; it is : 
"The stomach is the seat of courage." 
Experience the First Teacher Re- 
carding Food. 
We use for food substances that are 
found in the world around us. How the 
earliest men and women learned what sub- 
stances would best satisfy hunger and build 
strong bodies we have no means of know-

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



ing. Experience is a dear teacher, but 
doubtless, outside of natural instinct she 
was the first teacher in the primitive world. 
Pobonous berries, though bright and at- 
tractive in color, are avoided by birds and 
four-footed animals by instinct The in- 
stincts of early man, as far as everything 
that pertained to the preservation of life 
was concerned, must have been very acute. 
At the present time the discovery of a really 
new article of food is of such rare occur- 
rence that we are justified in saying there 
are none such to be discovered. Of course 
there may be foods new to us, but some 
one else has already known and used them. 

Water, Air, Carbon and Combustion. 

Water and air are vital necessities to us, 
but they are not accounted food, as they 
cannot stay hunger, build tissues. or supply 
heat or energy ; still food is of no value to 
us without them, and, in composition with 
other compounds, they enter into all food. 
Carbon is another compound that occurs in 
food and in almost all matter in the world 
around us. When a crust of bread is 
toasted until it is charred throughout, we 
know it as carbon. The charred remains 
of all substances are carbon. So also is the 
smoke left upon the lamp chimney, when 
the wick of a lamp is turned too high. 

Air is composed of two invisible gases, 
oxygen and nitrogen ; when carbon is ig- 
nited, the oxygen from the air unites with 
it rapidly, giving off light and heat and we 
have what is called combustion, burning or 
a fire. 

Carbon Dioxide a Product of Com- 
bustion. 

Pour a little lime-water into a glass jar, 
shake the jar and note there is no change 
in the appearance of the lime-water. Pour 
out the lime water, rinse the jar, dry it and 
set into it a lighted candle, cover the top 
of the jar with a pane of glass and note 
what happens. The candle bums for a few 
moments then when there is no more oxygen 
to unite with the carbon of the candle, com- 
bustion ceases. Remove the candle, pour 
in a little lime-water and shake the jar — 
the lime-water becomes cloudy. Now put 



a glass tube into a bottle containing lime- 
water, letting one opening come below the 
water, put the other end of the tube into 
the mouth and exhale from the lungs, letting 
the air pass into the tube ; now shake the 
jar and note that the lime-water becomes 
cloudy. 

When lime-water takes on a cloudy ap- 
pearance, we know that it contains caibon 
dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a product of 
combustion. The caibon dioxide exhaled 
from the lungs was formed in the body. 
Oxygen taken in through the lungs unites 
with the carbon in the food, thus producing 
carbon dioxide and incidentally heat to 
warm the body. The process of combus- 
tion in this case is probably, almost synono- 
mouswith the process of digestion. Thus 
the process of digestion, or we might say 
of living, is largely dependent upon our 
breathing in a full supply of air, pregnant 
with oxygen. By breathing upon the hand 
you will find that moisture ( water ) is one 
of the products of combustion in the body, 
as it is of all combustion. 

Nitrogen, Its Abundance in the Body 
AND Source of Supply. 

Nitrogen is the other element of which 
air is composed. Every active tissue in 
plant and animal contains nitrogen. Brain, 
muscle, bone, even the digestive juices and 
other bodily secretions are all largely made 
up of nitrogeiL If nitrogen be withheld 
from the body, the body dies, though for a 
time the vital organs will draw upon the 
nitrogen stored in the various tissues of the 
system and the body will carry on its work 
by feeding upon itself. But it is impossi- 
ble for the body to take its supply of nitro- 
gen, first hand, as it were, from the air, and 
though air is four-fifths nitrogen, all of this 
element is returned to the air, when the 
oxygen in composition has been taken in 
by the lungs. Nitrogen must be supplied 
in composition with other elements in food. 
The articles we use as food are complex in 
their composition. 

Elements Found in Our Food. 

Our food, then, must contain the ele- 
ments that make up the body ; it must con- 



COOKERY FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS 



393 



tain carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, 
iron, Sulphur, and all the minor elements 
which go to make up the body ; these exist 
in articles of food not as simple elements but 
as compounds, to which, partly on account 
of their repetition in this and that article of 
food, we give the name of proximate or 
food principles. 

Proximate or Food Principles. 

The chief of these proximate principles 
are classified as water, mineral matter, pro- 
teid, fats and carbohydrates. The body of 
a man of average weight is said to contain 
1 08 pounds of water, 1 1 pounds of mineral 
matter, 29.75 pounds of proteid, 5 pounds 
of fat and . 25 of a pound of carbohydrates. 
From this we can judge somewhat of the 
quantity of the different principles to be 
supplied in the food ; but, as we shall see 
later on, the proportion of the different 
principles needed depends on still other 
conditions than the quantity in the body. 

The most important of these principles 
are the proteids, because they are the only 
ones that can supply the nitrogen so needful 
in tissue building and repairing ; proteid 
may also furnish heat and energy, but pro- 
teid is represented chiefly in our most ex- 
pensive foods ; and, as fats and carbohy- 
drates are less expensive and even better 
than proteid as a source of heat and en- 
ergy, it were the part of wisdom to reserve 
proteid food to build tissue and choose 
fats and carbohydrates to supply the body 
with its heat and energy. Indeed, foods 
abounding in these two latter principles are 
often called proteid sparers and, also, fuel 
foods. Thus, if the carbohydrates are to 
act as fuel foods, furnishing us with heat 
and energy, we can see that we must supply 
them in the food in greater proportion than 
would be indicated by the quantity present 
in the body as shown above. 

Now we wish to look more closely at 
these proximate principles. Let us begin 
with the most important and the most ex- 
pensive, the proteids. 

Proteids. 

There are five important substances and 
quite a number of less important ones that 



we group under the term proteids. These 
substances are thus grouped, because each 
and every one of them has a similar chemi- 
cal composition and thus performs the same 
function in the body. They contain nitro- 
gen, an element found in no other food 
principle, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sul- 
phur, and. are tissue builders. These five 
proteids have marked physical characteris- 
tics which we can note in our kitchens, if we 
do not have a labratory in which to study 
their chemical composition. Carefully try 
the following experiments and you will, in 
the future, have a fairly good understand- 
ing of what is meant by the term proteid. 

Physical Properties of Proteids. 

Gradually stir two tablespoonfuls of water 
into half a cup of flour to form a dough, 
knead the dough until it becomes smooth 
and elastic, then work it ( in the hands c r 
on a sieve ) under a faucet of running water 
until the water running off from the dough 
loses its milky appearance. The gray sub- 
stance left in your hands you will find ten- 
acious and elastic ; you can stretch and fold 
it as you would molasses candy or rubber 
bands. This elastic mass is gluten^ one of 
the five representative proteids. 

Add one or two tablespoonfuls of vin^ar 
to half a cup of milk and let the whole be- 
come slightly warm ; drain off the whey and 
wash the curd remaining ; this curd is elastic 
and tenacious ; it is casein, a second repre- 
sentative proteid. The white of an egg, 
which is largely albumin^ another proteid, 
is also elastic and tenacious. The pulp of 
lean meat, scraped from the white connec- 
tive tissues, represents the chief proteid in 
meat, by name myosin. The fifth of the 
group is legumin^ the proteid found in the 
pulse family ( peas, beans, lentils, etc ) 
When you come to have experience in 
cooking these five substances, you will learn 
that all are toughened by a high degree of 
heat. All of them when dried may be re- 
duced to a similar, fine, powdery state. 

Gelatinoids. 
When we first spoke of proteids, we re- 
ferred to a number that were of less im- 
portance than the five true proteids which 



394 



THE BOSTON COOKINGSCHOOL MAGAZINE 



we have now referred to under the names 
gluten, casein, albumin, myosin and legu- 
min ; these others are set in a class by them- 
selves, for, though they contain mitrogen, 
they can not alone supply the nitrogen 
needed by the body — they lack something 
present in the true proteids, though they 
may replace a part of the proteid in the 
diet. The best known of these substances 
is gelatine ; others are ossein of which bone 
is largely composed ; heratin, present in the 
hair and in the horns and hoofs of animals, 
and collagen, which forms the greater part 
of the connective tissue of meat All of 
these are not toughened by boiling, but are 
changed into gelatine. These are the gela- 
tinoids. 

Extractives. 

In meat there are nitrogenous substances 
that give it flavor ; we notice these promi- 
nently in beef tea and clear soup ; these arc 
called extractives ; they are not true foods, 
in as much as they do not build tissue or 
supply heat, but they influence digestion. 

Protein. 

The proteids, gelatinoids and extractives 
are classed together under the name pro- 
tein. 



QUESTIONS. 

1. How do we know that carbon di- 
oxide is produced in the body ? 

2. Why is an abundant supply of air 
essential to life ? 

3. If the protein is not supplied in the 
food — as when one is sick and does not 
eat — from what source is protein obtained 
for life's processes? 

4. Why do we call proteids the most 
important of the proximate principles ? 

5. Give a list of twelve articles of food 
that are classed rich in the proteid principle. 

6. How much time did it take to wash 
the starch from the gluten in the ball of 
dough ? 

7. Name three physical characteristics 
of the proteids ? What is the meaning of 
the word proteid ? 

8. In what way do extractives influence 
digestion ? 

9. Does heat affect proteids and gela- 
tinoids in the same way ? 

10. Which is the broader term, protein 

or proteid ? 

Note: — In the next lesson the subject of Food 
Principles is continued. The management of a 
gas range and the Prindpal Methods of Cooking 
are considered. Measuring is noted and cooking 
itself is begrun. — Editor, 



A Fishing Party 



HERE' S a novel idea for a church en- 
tertainment which requires little 
preparation. 
A rustic bridge was built out from the stage, 
enclosing a square space that was used for 
a fish-pond. Rocks and ferns were grouped 
along the edge of the stage, the floor was 
covered with green carpet, and a pretty 
meadow scene painted on coarse cotton was 
hung at the back of the stage, making a 
very picturesque setting for the pond. 
Steps led up to the bridge, and at the foot 
was a rustic lodge, where, on payment of a 
fee, the prospective fisher was given a pole 
and a circle of cardboard, upon which was 
marked the number of times he was en- 
titled to fish. Thus equipped, he went 



up on the bridge and fished in the pond. 
Tickets were also sold by the bridgekeepers. 

Refreshments were served, and there 
were a candy and cake table and two stalls, 
where &ncy articles were sold. One of 
these stalls bore the sign. Fish Market 
Here fish of many brilliant colors and quaint 
shapes were for sale; there were blotters, 
shaving-cases, pin-cushions and sacliet bags. 

On the cake table were many toothsome 
fishes — chocolate and clear candy fishes 
and boxes of candy decorated with water- 
color and pen and ink sketches, also sand- 
wiches cut out with fish-shaped tin cutters, 
also cookies and small iced cakes. 

At intervals singing, recitations and tab- 
leaux mav be ffiven for varietv. 



I (o this depanmenl will be glndly received. Accepted ileros will be paid for at 



Water-Cress 

TH E water that comes from a dear cold 
spring makes the best place in which 
to grow water-cress. Nothing is more ap- 
petizing than cress gathered fresh from crys- 
tal dear water. Either seed or portions of 
(he plant cut off and scattered fresh in very 
shallow water may be used in starting a bed 
of cress, and once started it lasts for all 
time. Ifthe water runs too swift or if space 
pemiits, the stream may be damed up and 
the water made to spread out into a shal- 
low bed. A much larger quantity of cress 
can thus be grown and a profit realized. 

A well grown bed eight feet square will pro- 
duce enough five-cent bunches at one cut- 
ting to filla barrel The bunches are packed 
in alternate layers with cracked ice, and 
often sell in the larger markets for five or six 
dollars per barrel. The local markets will 
usually take a limited supply at a fair profit. 
The cress can be cut throughout the year ex- 
cept in the coldest weather, when it should 
be entirely flooded for winter protection. 

If seed b used it should be lightly sown 
broadcast in moist soil tbat has been well 
fertilized with cow manure and the water 
not turned on until the first leaves have 
formed. The depth of the water may be 
gradually increased as the plants grow, but 
should never entirely cover them. The 
water should be made to flow tiniformly 
over the whole bed. If the current is con- 
fined to one side only, the cress will de- 
velop there and die out in the more stag- 
nant water. 

Cress is most relished in the early spring. 
At that time the system seems to crave spicy 
pungents or bitter herbs like horse-radish. 



water-cress and dandelions. Cress brings 
the highest price at this time, later in the 
season there is less call for it If allowed 
to bloom, the quality of the cress deteri- 
orates, becoming much more pungent than 
the fresh young cress. Anyone with a 
spring of running water should not be with- 
out this delicious spring tonic and always 
attractive garnish for meats and fish. It 
may also be boiled and served like spinach, 
making excellent greens. C. B. Smith. 

In Way of Economy 

WHEN the price of e^s is as high aa 
has prevailed this winter, desserts, 
tempting and good, made without them are 
welcomed. Cut apples in balls with vege- 
table scoop and steam until tender in a litde 
water with sugar and two tablespoonfiils of 
lemon juice. Toast slices of bread or stale 
cake dipped in a little milk with melted but- 
ler. Pile apple-balls on toast with five or 
six blanched almonds set up between the 
balls; add bits of any kind of fruit jelly or 
marmalade. Very nice, eaten with plain or 
whipped cream. 

Shelled almonds are a real blessing to a 
housekeeper. They help in a dozen dif- 
ferent ways in completing desserts and add- 
ing to vegetable dishes. Boiled rice com- 
bines well with blanched almonds. After 
cooking a few minutes in water, let the rice 
simmer in milk, which it will absorb, then 
sweeten and put in a handful of blanched 
almonds. Put into molds to stiffen, when 
cold serve with cream or hot chocolate 
sauce poured over mold. 

On a buttered pan put a large spoonful 
of smoothly -mashed and well-beaten white

potato. Shape these little mounds either 
round or oblong, and on the top stick up- 
right three blanched almonds. Brown 
lightly in oven. Very nice, served with 
chops or steak. I. C. C.

My Bread-box 

IN arranging my kitchen I found I had 
no place where the ordinary tin bread- 
box would find a resting place, but some 
sort of a receptacle for the staff of life I 
must have, and now I have solved the 
question very much to my own satisfaction^ 
and my friends think my box far superior 
to their own. I happened to have a 
drawer that was six inches deep and about 
eighteen inches square, and I had a tin lin- 
ing mad2 by the tinsmith, and half of the 
top of the lining was on hinges so that, when 
the drawer was pulled out half way, the 
cover could be lifted up to put in the 
bread or take it out The bread or cake 
keeps fresh, and no dust or mice can pos- 
sibly get at it, and when the box is closed 
and pushed back it is entirely out of the 
way and within easy reach at the same 
time. 

It was so convenient I had another lin- 
ing for a cake and biscuit drawer, and a 
third for sugar. Of the last two mentioned 
each had a division across the drawer to 
separate the large and small cakes, also the 
sugar drawer for different kinds of sugar. 

I hope some will try these tin-lined 
boxes and I am sure they will wonder no 
one thought of them before.

Value of Hot Milk 

WHO appreciates the value of a cup of 
"Hot Milk?" Well, if those 
who cannot drink cold milk will try it hot 
for a while, they will more than likely be 
pleased with the result It is a relief, as 
well as a cure for many ills, not least among 
these may be mentioned sleeplessness. 
Often a person goes to bed so tired that he 
is nervous, and cannot get to sleep ; now 
is the time to have the milk heated hot, 



but not boiling ; pour it into a cup and 
drink it slowly, ( sip it, in other words ), 
lie down, and as far as possible dismiss 
everything from the mind, and try to let 
tomorrow take care of itself, remembering 
that ** Sufficient unto the day is xke good 
thereof. * ' 

When one comes in tired from shopping, 
a meal will often cause an attack of indi- 
gestion ; instead of a meal try a cup of hot 
milk, and a couple of nice crackers. Some 
may think that is not much for a hungry 
person ; let them try it and see. Some- 
times a litde flavoring will be a pleasant 
addition, a pinch of salt, a litde sugar, a 
little cinnamon or nutmeg, or even a litde 
vanilla. Surely all know how comforting 
milk is to the skin ; if sunburnt bathe the 
&ce often with miUc ; if the skin is dry or 
rough from wind and cold, wash the face 
night and morning with warm milk, it is 
better than any boughten preparation to be 
had. Sweet cream is healing to chapped 
lips and hands ; milk makes the skin soft 
and white, and is especially good for those 
who live in heated rooms ; use warm as a 
wash upon retiring; try it

In the Spring 

HERE is an admirable "Spring Tonic;" 
the prescription was given me by a 
reputable physician, and will be found 
efficacious for all who will try it Let me 
give it as iJriefly as possible. Halve your 
food, double your drinking water, and do 
not have it ice cold ; treble your out-of- 
door exercise and quadruple your con- 
sumption of fresh air and laughter. The 
mentally active person requires a laige 
amount of ripe, first-class fruit and nuts, 
littie meat, and grains ( cereals ) but sel- 
dom. Partly mental and physical laborers 
should use fruit and vegetables and more 
nuts and grains than the purely mentally 
employed. While physically active indi- 
viduals require all combined, and the diet 
must be varied and tempting alike. Let 
every one eat all the greens possible, at aD 
seasons. Acid fruits are not easily digested 
by some, and cause a disturbance, such as

gas, even cramps ; these folks should try 
stewed fruit, and thus overcome the diffi- 
culty. 

Nut Omelet 

A MOST satisfying and easily prepared 
luncheon or tea dish, is made as fol-' 
lows : Put through the food grinder suffi- 
cient nut-meat to make a gill ( after being 
ground ) ; beat three eggs very light, season 
to taste with salt and pepper, and add three 
tablespoonfiils of cold water, then the 
ground nut-meat and mix thoroughly ; have 
a piece of butter the size of a walnut very 
hot in a thick, iron frying-pan, pour in the 
mixture, and as soon as it begins to ** set," 
lift the edges and let the soft part run un- 
der ; continue so until it is firm all over, 
being careful not to let it bum ; fold it over, 
and send to the table on a hot dish. This 
omelet, unlike others, will never fall and dis- 
appoint ; the nuts impart a delicious flavor, 
and at the same time give body to the eggs. 
It is a wise plan to put an asbestos mat 
under the pan when cooking eggs, as they 
scorch so easily, and thus spoil the delicate 
taste. People seem to think eggs are so 
easy to cook that the taste cannot be spoiled, 
but that is a great mistake, and to my 
mindy eggs require the most careful atten- 
tion. Lucia Noble.

one egg, beaten until light, and one-half a 
lemon cut into small piecs. This sauce is 
also nice, served with apple dumpling.

A Roast of Beef for Two 

^T TELL-cooked roast beef is delicious 
W but it takes carefiil planning, in a 
family of two, to use every scrap of the 
meat without tiring of it before it is one- 
half gone. 

We buy a prime cut, two rib roast of 
beef costing about |i. lo, then the butcher 
cuts the rib bones off short without spoiling 
the shape of our roast This long piece he 
puts into pickle on Saturday, and we have 
a fine piece of corned beef delivered to us 
on Wednesday morning. This is included 
in the first cost of the roast We have the 
roast beef for Saturday's dinner, cooked 
rare, as we like it, with white and sweet 
potatoes browned in the pan and a good 
brown gravy made from the drippings. 

For Sunday's luncheon we have a few 
thin slices of the beef, cold, and the re- 
mainder is sliced thin for dinner on Mon- 
day. 

For variety, chicken, lamb or other meat 
is served for Sunday dinner. There are 
still scraps around the bone and bits of 
meat which could not be sliced evenly. 
These are run through the meat chopper 
and, if not sufficient, bread crumbs and 
chopped potato are added with a bit of the 
brown gravy. This is made hot, well- 
seasoned and served on crisp pieces of toast 
garnished with parsley, making a good dish 
either for luncheon or breakfast 

The bones are well-cracked and covered 
with water, and any cold vegetables on hand 
are added, also a sprig of parsley, slice of 
onion, bit of celery top, a bay leaf, small 
piece of ham, minced fine, the juice from a 
can of tomatoes and a handfiil of barley. 
This is sinmiered for several hours, strained 
and allowed to cool ; remove all fat from the 



39^

surface and then add chopped carrot, tur- 
nip and celery, and boil until the vegetables 
are tender; seasoned well with salt, pepper 
and kitchen boquet and served hot, this 
makes a very good soup. 

There is still left the sliced beef from 
Monday's dinner with some of the brown 
gravy and the balance of the can of toma- 
toes. Cook macaroni or spaghetti in boil- 
ing, salted water until tender. Meanwhile 
make a sauce for the meat as follows : Fry 
a small quantity of chopped onion in bacon 
fiat, add what is left of the tomato and 
gravy, season well and thicken with flour 
and water. Place the slices of meat on a 
fire-proof platter, pour over this the sauce 
and arrange the macaroni as a border. 
Sprinkle well with grated cheese and place 
in the oven until the meat is well heated 
through. It must not cook or it will be 
tough. Serve garnished with tufb of pars- 
ley and slices of lemon, sprinkled with pap- 
rika. Green peppers, chopped, or dried 
mushrooms, well-soaked and chopped, are 
an addidon to the same. 

On Wednesday the corned beef is put 
into plenty of cold water, brought quiddy 
to a boil and then simmered undl tender. 
The meat is left in the liquor until it is 
time to cook the vegetables, when it is 
removed and all &t is skimmed from the 
top of the water. In this liquor boil two 
carrots, two turnips, two onions, two sweet 
potatoes, two white potatoes and a small 
cabbage cut into quarters. Just before 
the vegetables are ready to serve put in the 
corned beef and heat thoroughly. Serve 
the meat in the center of the platter with 
all the vegetables around and garnish well 
with parsley. The cabbage should be 
served in a separate dish. 

This method of preparing corned beef is 
much more wholesome than the old way, as 
it is the £aX that makes the vegetables so in- 
digestible. They still have aU the flavor of 
the meat and yet they are not greasy. 
There will probably be enough of the 
corned beef left for hash, or sliced, for 
luncheon. We have had three dinners, 
three other meals and a soup from our 
roast, costing one dollar and ten cents, or 



less than eighteen cents a meal for meat, 
and, better still than the economy, we have 
had six appetizing meals, no two alike.

" A Bear Luncheon " 

IN Chicago, and elsewhere, I suppose, 
there is a fad among young ladies of 
carrying toy bears with them; and one sees 
them everywhere; while stopping, at lun- 
cheon, while calling, and at night they are 
securely chained to the bedpost to ward ofif 
any chance buiglar. This luncheon was 
given as a result of this fad. 

The invitations requested the company 
of * * Johnny Bear ' ' and Mistress, to lunch- 
eon on Friday, March — , 

The color scheme was brown and white 
to match the bears, and the guests were 
seated at a ''bare*' oak table set with lace 
doilies. The centerpiece was a bowl of 
white asters held by four brown bears. On 
the table were glass dbhes of dates, nuts, 
figs and peppermints, and glass candlesticks 
with white candles, stood at the comers. 
The candleshades were made of white art 
paper, cut eight-sided, with a painted bear 
on each side. The place cards were tiny 
market baskets of v^etables, made of Ger- 
man Matzipan, with ''Johnny Bear's" 
name on the handle. 

Following was the menu : 

Consomme, Toast Strips. 

Creamed Fish, Brown Bread. 

Creamed Potatoes, Breaded Chops. 

Lima Beans, Browned Rolls. 

Dates, Cheese, Nut Salad, Toasted Crackers. 

Individual Ice-Cream (in the shape of bears). 

Small Chocolate and white Cakes. 

Coffee.

New Dinner Cards 

ONE of the newest ideas in dinner cards 
is to have a pen-and-ink sketch of 
the guest herself, and hostesses who have 
friends skilful with such work, or who can 
make the sketches themselves are very for- 
tunate. Plain cards are, however, most 
used, a simple monogram or crest or name 
of the family home at the top being the only 
decoration.

Medallions of Beef with Marrow 

Have beef from the fillet cut in slices 
half an inch thick and trim these into per- 
fect rounds about three inches across. Broil 
about four minutes ; pour over them a 
brown sauce and set above each round a 
piece of parboiled marrow half or three- 
fourths an inch long. To parboil the mar- 



row, cut it into pieces, cover with boiling 
water and let stand on the back of the range, 
where the water will keep hot, but not boil, 
for ten minutes. The trinmiings of beef 
may be used for timbales of beef forcemeat 
or for Hamburg steak. 



Query 1220. — Mrs, J. R. B., Alexandria, Va.: 
"* Kindly tell me the secret of making soup-atock 
from bones left from cooked meats. 

Soup Stock from Cooked Meat 

Bones 

Considerable nonsense is written con- 
cerning the use of bones in soup making. 
Bones of themselves contain very little that 
is useful in soups. Certainly we would not 
select them as flavoring agents. The 
browned juices of the meat, dried upon the 
bones, and the browned tat or lean meat, 
adhering to them, will give color and flavor. 
Chicken and veal bones contain much gel- 
atine, which has some food value and is of 
use, if the stock is to be kept a day or two, 
as a jellied stock will keep longer than one 
in a liquid state. In making such stock, 
add if possible a few bits of lean meat, like 
the flank ends of steaks or chops. Add 
water barely to cover the whole and let 
simmer an hour. For each quart of water 
used, add a teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful, each, of such vegetables as are at 
hand — celery, carrot and onion with pars- 
ley, being among the best — and let sim- 
mer half an hour longer, then drain and 
set aside.

of five eggs. Spread in two layer-cake 
pans. Press halves of English walnuts into 
the top of one of the layers, to make length- 
wise rows of nut-meats. Sprinkle the whole 
with white sugar, and bake about twenty 
minutes. Put the layers together with 

Chocolate Nut Frosting 

Boil one cup of sugar and half a cup of 
water, until it forms a thread when tried 
with a spoon. Pour in a fine stream, beat- 
ing constantly, on to the beaten yolk of two 
eggs. Then pour this mixture on to a 
square of melted chocolate, add the 
chopped meats remaining from a pound of 
unshelled nuts, and half a teaspoonful of 
vanilla extract, and beat until cold enough 
to spread. 

Corn-bread 

Pass through a sieve, together, one cup, 
each, of corn-meal and white flour, one- 
fourth a cup of sugar, half a teaspoonful of 
salt and four and one-half level teaspoon- 
fuls of baking-powder. Beat one egg until 
light; add nearly a cup of sweet milk and 
pour into the dry ingredients with three 
tablespoonfiils of melted butter; mix all to- 
gether thoroughly, and bake in a shallow 
pan about twenty-five minutes. 

Finnan Haddie, " Boiled " 

Select a thick fish. Put flesh side down 
in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and 
set to cook on the back of the range. In 
about half an hour draw tj a hotter part 
of the range, and gradually heat the water 
to the simmering-point. Let simmer from 
five to ten minutes, then drain the fish 
carefully. Serve on a hot platter. Pass 
at the same time hot, boiled potatoes and 
egg sauce. 

Finnan Haddie, Delmonico Style 

Prepare the fish as above, then separate 
the flesh into flakes, discarding skin and 
bones. For each cup of fish prepare a cup 
of cream sauce; /. ^., melt two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, cook in it two level table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one-fourth a teaspoon- 
ful, each, of salt and pepper, and gradually 



add one cup of milk. Reheat the fish in 
the sauce. To serve au gratin, put the 
fish and sauce into a buttered au gratin 
dish, in alternate layers, having the last 
layer of sauce. Cover with cracker crumbs 
(two- thirds a cup to a fourth a cup of but- 
ter) mixed with melted butter, and set into 
a hot oven to brown the crumbs. 

Finnan Haddie Cooked in Milk 

Prepare as above. Then, after draining 
thoroughly, set into an au gratin dish. Pour 
over about a pint of milk or cream sauce, 
and let stand in the oven ten or fifteen 
minutes, basting three times with the milk 
or sauce. — For other recipes for preparing 
Finnan Haddie, see magazine for May^

canned fruit be used as fruit cocktails." 

Fruit Cocktails with Canned Fruit 

Almost all canned fruits, either one va- 
riety alone or a mixture of several, may be 
used in cocktails. Peach, pear or apricot

are, each and all, good combined with 
pieces of orange. The fruit should be very 
cold and sweetened slightly. A preserved 
chestnut is good at the bottom of the glass. 
The fruit may be mobtened with a little 
of the chestnut syrup and kirsch, maras- 
chino or curacoa may or may not be added. 



Query 1225.— Mrs. M. H., Bonham, Texas : 
** A recipe for lyonnese potatoes." 

Lyonnese Potatoes 

Take half a small peeled onion and chop 
it very fine. Stir and cook the onion in one 
or two tablespoonfuls of butter until soft- 
ened and slightly browned. Skim the onion 
from the frying-pan, to free it from the 
butter. To the butter in the pan add two 
tablespoonfuls. Turn in a generous pint of 
cold, boiled potato, cut in slices between 
one-fourth and one-half an inch thick ; stir 
and cook until they are browned slightly 
and very hot, sprinkling meanwhile with 
half a teaspoonful of salt Add the cooked 
onion, toss the onion and potato together 
thoroughly, and serve on a hot dish. 



Query 1226.— Miss M. Z. V. N. : " Recipe for 
scrambled eggs, light, flaky and dry as pop-cono,** 

Scrambled Eggs, Reformed Style 

Turn four tablespoonfuls of milk into an 
agate frying-pan, and add half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt Beat four eggs with a silver 
fork just enough to thoroughly break the 
yolks. Then turn the egg into the hot 
milk. Cook over a gentle fire, stirring as 
the egg thickens, and adding, now and 
then, a bit of butter, until two tablespoon- 
fuls have been used. When lightly set, 
turn on to a hot serving-dish. 



Query 1227. — Miss L. S., Denver, Colorado: 
** Some ways of using '^bag " figs for dessert. 

Figs for Dessert 

Figs, cooked tender in boiling water, with 
a little sugar added at the last of the cook- 
ing, are good cold with cream. The figs with 
the addition of wine, orange or lemon jelly, 
cut in cubes, and whipped cream, make an 
elaborate dessert dish. 



Fig Whip 

Cook four or five figs as above, then cut 
them in small pieces. Beat the whites of 
five eggs until dry ; gradually beat in three 
level tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, then fold in three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and the prepared figs. 
Turn the mixture into a buttered pudding 
dish and bake about twenty-five minutes. 
Bake in a dish of hot water and with many 
folds of paper under the baking-dish. The 
water should not boil Serve from the 
baking-dish, and with cream or a boiled 
custard made with the yolks of the eggs. A 
teaspoonful of oom-starch, cooked in a pint 
of milk ten minutes, with the beaten yolks 
of two eggs, and mixed with one-third a 
cup of sugar, will make a good custard for 
pudding sauce, leaving three yolks for en- 
riching some other dish. 



StuflFed Figs 

Cut a small slit in the stem end of each 
fig and work in two or more blanched al- 
monds. A mixture that is very palatable 
is a paste made from almonds, walnuts and 
hickory nuts, to which are added a few 
drops of sherry. A portion of the soft meat 
of the figs is taken out, using a knife or a 
small pointed spoon. The fig is now filled 
with the paste. When filled, press the 
opening together and roll the fig in granu- 
lated sugar.

Good Luncheons for Rural Schools 

Without a Kitchen. By Ellen A. 

Richards. Price, lo cents. Boston: 

Whitcomb & Barrows. 

In twelve pages Mrs Richards tells how 
to approach this subject in an economic and 
scientific manner. The possibility of pre- 
paring warm lunches, the children doing 
the actual work, and the teacher serving as 
steward, is th e problem. The obj ects sought 
in this, are the health of the children, their 
instruction in cooking, and also such in- 
struction in table manners as may be given 
without hurting the pride or feelings of the 
children. To teachers and parents, who 
are in any wise interested in children's 
luncheons in country schools, this pamphlet 
will be suggestive of practical ways and 
means. 



The Home Economics Movement. By 

Isabel Bevier and Susannah Usher. 

Price 75 cents net Boston : Whitcomb 

& Barrows. 

Here in brief space are to be found the 
data or facts that bear on the origin, develop- 
ment and present status of home economics. 
In other words, what has been done up to 
date in home economics, in agricultural 
colleges and state universities, in cooking 
schools and in the public schools, is simply 
and plainly stated in the pages of this litde 
volume. Hitherto, the facts contained 
herein, have not been easy of access ; this 
sketch of a comparatively recent movement 
will be of great convenience and value to 
many. The time is not distant when the 
education of women, especially the higher 
education of women, began to receive special 
attention ; still less distant is the time when 
it was possible for women to receive special 
instruction in domestic economy. Indeed, 
home economics is still wanting a proper 
definition. People do not know just what 
is meant by the term home or domestic 
economics. It would seem, however, that 



the day is approaching, in which in the 
training of women some special instruction 
will be given in preparation for the work 
they are destined to do. In these days it 
is quite essential to prepare for definite lines 
of activity. On every hand intelligence is 
demanded. The trained cook is wanted 
as much as the trained nurse. Surely the 
art of housekeeping should not be left 
wholly subject to intuitive knowledge. 



A Friend's Tip 

70- Year-Old Man Not too Old to Accept a Food 

Pointer. 

**For the list 20 years,*' writes a Maine 
man, **I*ve been troubled with Dyspepsia 
and liver complaint, and have tried about 
every known remedy without much in the 
way of results until I took up the food 
question. 

**A friend reconmiended Grape-Nuts 
food, after I had taken all sorts of medi- 
cines with only occasional temporary relief. 

**This was about nine months ago, and 
I began the Grape-Nuts for breakfast with 
cream and a little sugar. Since then I have 
had the food for at least one meal a day, 
usually for breakfast

The Making of a Housewife. By Isabel 

Gordon Curtis. Cloth. IlL * Price, $i. 

New York : Frederick A. Stokes Co. 

There are twelve chapters and sixty-eight 

illustrations in this book. It might be said 

to contain twelve lessons given by a wise 

and experienced housewife to a young 

housekeeper. Each paper is couched in 

very readable form and is full of wholesome 

advice and valuable information. The 

friendship that is supposed to exist between 

teacher and pupil points to a condition that 

renders instruction all the more interesting. 



In the Miz. By Grace E. Ward, with 
eight full page plates in color and numer- 
ous text illustrations by Clara E. Atwood. 
Cloth. Price, 1 1.50 Boston: Little, 
Brown & Co. 

** In the Miz " is a story-book for chil- 
dren. But it is one of the story-books that 
*' grown ups" can appreciate quite as well 
as the children to whom it is read. Every 
story is quaintly humorous. In the * * Story 
for Frances," while the attention of the 
children is taken up with the Giant, Time,, 
that is older than the stars, and never sleeps 
a wink or stops going even when he is sick, 
the reader is smiling to himself over the 
suggestion that, **if there is anything you 
want to know you had better ask the Giant 
Time, for the^e are some things that Time 
alone can tell.*' And again the reader 
smiles when the Giant Thoughtlessness 
leaves his umbrella and rubbers on the steps 
of Time's castle. Time coming out quickly 
tripped over them and fell, but he never 
even looked around to see what he stum- 
bled over, for * * Time never looks back. ' ' 

In this same story there is a trial scene 
before the Chief Justice. ** What has this 
child done?** asks the Chief Justice. 
**She was playing hide-and-seek, and she 
peeked, ' ' said the Stork. This is for chil- 
dren ; but the point in regard to the jury- 
men, though quite above the apprehension 
of the children, is enjoyed by grown-up 
children. Here it is : The Chief Justice 
sat on the throne, and on each side of him 
were growing six crimson and gold tulips 



with their blossoms tightly closed. " Let 
the prisoner be brought in," said the Chief 
Justice ; and as he spoke the twelve tulips 
slowly opened and in each sat a little man. 
These were the twelve jury-men, who had 
never seen the light of day until the tulips 
opened, so they made excellent jury-men, 
as they knew absolutely nothing. 



No Mistake Here 

DiACovery of a Proof-Reader 

Even a proof-reader may make mistakes 
unless careful reading is maintained all the 
time. 

It makes a lot of difference sometimes, 
just how a thing is read. 

This is the tale : 

** * No tea and not one drop of coffee,* 
ordered the doctor — and I rebelled. But 
alas, with nerves that saw, felt and heard 
things that were not, rebellion was useless. 

"With the greatest reluctance I gave up 
these lifelong companions, and drank milk, 
milk — until the very step of the millcnian 
grew hateful. 

**My nerves were some better, buf 
breakfast without some warm beverage 
grew wearisome, and bid fair to be entirely 
slighted. And with a brain that for nine 
hours daily must work hard, ever demand- 
ing nourishment, the failing appetite was a 
serious proposition. 

"Then in despair, Postum was tried. 
I had tasted it once and heartily disliked 
the pale, watery compound, but now, liter- 
ally starving for a hot drink, I read and 
re-read the directions on the package with 
the critical eye of the proof-reader, follow- 
ing them out to the letter and lo I the rich 
brown liquid of the advertisements. 

* ' Not one but three cups disappeared and 
since then Postum has been my sole warm 
beverage, unfailingly, refreshing and help- 
ful ; both body and nerves testif3ang to its 
helpfulness by new strength and vigor."

With the Help of a Brother 

( Concluded from page j7/. ) 

all in white, and — finding this friend of 
years ago waiting for her. 

It was in prospect delightfully romantic. 
Marion waited two weeks for Bob's leuer, 
and, when it did come, it was not altogether 
satisfactory, containing a few lines in his- 
scrawly, back hand. A brief account of 
his business doings, and ending in this 
fashion : 

**ril try to. look up Bainbridge*s ad- 
dress, and give him a bid.*' Not much 
to build one's hopes upon, perhaps, yet 
that evening Marion was so quiet that 
Kittie, her younger sister, asked her if she 
had a headache, and then continued her 
stormy practicing, without waiting for a re- 
ply. Her quiet sister was deciding how she 
would arrange the long living-room the day 
on which her caller should arrive. It must 
be carefully shaded so that the worn rugs 
might not show up too glaringly. She 
would have several bowls of flowers scat- 
tered around — that always gave such a 
feminine touch — and every bit of Kittie' s 
ragged music carefully tucked away in the 
closet. Possibly one of her own songs laid 
on the rack, Greig preferred. Then Kelpie, 
dear loving collie, had to be shut in the 
stable, and not allowed in the room in his 
usual familiar fashion — he was so large — 
it was very easy to step on him, even to fall 
over him, for he was loth to move when 
once comfortably settled on a favorite rug. 

As the weeks came and went Marion 
told herself that Bob was a careless fellow, 
entirely too much taken up with his own 
affairs to consider his sister's interests. 
Brothers were alike the world over. Pos- 
sibly, with a disdainful lift of a firm chin, 
Mr. Bainbridge might have been given the 
invitation, and did n' t care to renew an ac- 
quaintance with a girl he had not seen in 
such a long time. Well, it was merely a 
passing fancy on her part, and it was all 
Aunt Charlotte's fault, anyway. 

Early one October afternoon a tall, well- 
groomed man adjusted his eye-glasses, and 
proceeded to study the old brown house 



he was approaching. 

** Allen *said his people lived on this 
street. Neglected to'tell me the number 
of the house, did mention, however, the 
interesting fact that the lawn would, un- 
doubtedly ncc J t: attliig, aud as he expressed 
It, I could easily place the baronial pile in 
that way. I'm inclined to believe this is 
the place. How homelike it looks ! ' ' 

He had reached the gate when from 
around the house came rushing a slim 
figure, clad in a blue linen shirtwaist gown, 
hair wildly ruffled, followed closely by an 
excited collie, who emitted short, sharp 
yelps of rapture as he tried to seize the ball 
she held in her hand. Straight on came 
the man, and Marion looking up met John 
Bainbridge' s honestly admiring eyes. 

Alas for the trailing white gown ! Alas 
for the artistically shaded living-room ! 
The long-expected guest was ushered into 
the family apartment where every shade, well 
up, let in the bright sunshine, which lin- 
gered pitilessly on rugs and furniture. 
Kittie' s untidy music was piled upon the 
piano ; unrebuked Kelpie walked boldly in, 
and lay content close to the visitor, whose 
muscular hand, as he talked, caressed the 
tawny head. 

"She hasn't grown an hour older," he 
mused ; "she's just the same adorable, im- 
pulsive girl I met that summer ; this quaint 
room flooded with sunshine, is a fit setting 
for her." And the expressive gray eyes 
said what their owner did not dare ask yet : 

"Shan't we begin where we left off five 
years ago ? ' '

Fumed and Golden Oak. 

One hears so frequently nowadays the 
terms "fumed oak" and "golden oak" 
that the question naturally arises as to the 
meaning of the tenns. 

The best "golden" effect is obtained 
with what is known as quartered oak, the 
log being sawn in half, and then these 
h^ves sawn in half again, making quarters. 
Each of these quarters are then sawn at 
right angles, with two sawn sides parallel 
with the bark side, this giving the flakes of 
the woods in their greatest area and beauty. 
The wood is then filled and stained. None 
of this treatment, however, affects the 
flakes, which show up a golden yellow, es- 
pecially after the varnish coats have been 
applied. 

"Fumed oak" is oak that has been 
treated with the fumes of ammonia. The 
effect of the ammonia is to darken the wood, 
and it also cuts the grain, roughing it up. 
After the wood has been treated with the 
fumes of the ammonia it is sandpapered 
down, and stained, or waxed, as the case 
may be. 



Current Cookery. 

IVaiter — "Yes, sir, we're very hup to 
date 'ere. We cookheverythinkbyhelec- 
tricity, ' ' 

Customer — "Oh, do you? Then just 
give this steak another shock." — Funch. 



Grump — "Do you call this steak fit 
for a Christian to eat ? " 

fVai/er — " We hain't anxious about de 
religion of our customers, boss." — SeUrted. 



Lord John Russell was not tactful On 
one occasion he took the Duchess of Inver- 
ness down to dinner, and, after he had sat 
down foraminute, he jumped up and went 
to the opposite side of the table and sat by 
the DuchcssofSt Albans. Hiswifeasked 
him afterward why he had done it He 
said, ' ' I should have been ill if I had sat 
withmybacktothatgreatfire." "Ihope," 
said Lady John, ' < you gave your reason to 
the Duchess of Inverness." "No," he 
said, 'I didn't; but I told the Duchess 
of St. Albans." 



It is surprising how a tall stool in the 
kitchen will lessen the labor attached to the 
performance of the routine duties — when 
one is wiping the dishes or even washing 
them and performing the various other 
duties such as ironing small articles, pre- 
paring vegetables, making cakes, pies and 
other things. If one gets all the material 
together and then sits down on the high 
stool to do the work, it will keep one off 
one's feet for several hours at a stretch. 



Sure Enough. 

Parson Bagster ( dogmatically ) — Dar 
ain't no use uh-' spostulatin ' and polly 
foxin' 'bout dese yuh flyin'-machmes ! 
Dey won't work, and dey isn't ever gwine 
to, needcr ! — de Lawd never intended de 
air to be circumambulated. 

Brother Snike — Yassah, but lemme ax 
yo ' ; How yo ' spect we' s uh-gwine t ' git 
to heaven — go ' round? — Puck.

need of suppressing and starving out, so fcr

Special emphasb is laid in "The Ne«

Metchnikoff, even fruits must be sterilized 
to insure safety from intestinal parasites. 
He regards the strawberry as one of the 
fruits most likely to convey to the stomach 
the eggs or larvae of parasitic worms. He 
seems to prove that appendicitis is often 
the result of infection and injury of the

Fruit Lunches 

Fruit luncheons, started on a small scale 
in London, met with such success that 
they led to the opening of a pretty saloon, 
cosy and warm in winter, light, airy and 
cool in summer, and just the place to en- 
tertain a friend. 

Seated there one day, I could almost 
believe myself in fairy-land. Under broad- 
growing palms, amid many beautiful flowers, 
which formed a sort of hedge-row along 
the window, pretty tables were set, with aa 
abundance of fruit and Japanese serviettes. 
Writing materials and magazines are pro- 
vided, giving the advantages of a private 
club. 

Choice fresh fruit, in and out of season^ 
is the specialty. I never tasted a more 
delicious fruit salad in which strawberries, 
nectarines, pears, grapes, apples, oranges, 
peaches, pineapples, and plenty of delicious 
cream mingled. Quick fruit luncheons 
have the merit of being very cheap. For 
IS. you have a slice of pineapple, a c^e 
plum, hothouse grapes and apples ; for 3d. 
less, a banana, apple, tangarine, plum» 
dates and nuts ; for 6d. , a banana, apple, 
orange, dates and nuts. Fruit salad costs 
6d. , a slice of pineapple 6d. , cape peaches 
4d. and 6d ; tea, coffee, chocolate, cream, 
milk, egg and milk, mineral waters, lemon 
squash, lime-juice, all sorts of cakes, pastry, 
bread and butter, toast muffins and jam are 
also to be had. 

These delicious fruits and nuts can just 
as well be served at home where they will 
be equally well enjoyed.

We very cheerfully throw out the sug- 
gestion. Ilie orange at its best is a beau 
tiful, delicious and wholesome fruit The 
" naval orange " of California if Dot quite 
equal in flavor and juiciness to the best of 
the Florida oranges, is nevertheless a valu- 
alile contribution to the nation's fruit sup- 
ply. Its freedom from seeds is a decided 
recommendation. But can all the groves 
in the country supply 80,000,000 orauj^es 
for consumption on one day? And where 
is the appropriation for the poor families 
that " have not the price? " 

As one good turn deserves another, the 
Herald suggests to the Riverside Chamber 
of Commerce, that it lend its aid in secur- 
ing the designation and observance of a 
National Apple Day. For universal and 
varied use the apple is still our "king of 
fruits." It grows in every state — though 
in some much better than others. Think 
of the varieties of the apple ! — of its adapt- 
ability to all classes and to manifold pur- 
poses. It is at once food, drink and med- 
icine. It bulges the pocket of the school 
boy, a potential part of his lunchcorL It 
adorns the rich man's table. It furnishes 
material for toothsome pies and seductive 
dumplings. There could be no cider nor 
apple sauce but for the fruit of this sturdy 
tree. Think, if you can of an appleless 
land, and then say if Orange Day should 
not be supplanted with Apple Day !

How Ruth Filled the Cup 

"Can I help too, grandma?" asked 
Ruth, as she sat down in the old-fashioned 
kitchen. 

Grandma was making pudding for com- 
pany, and Hannah was stuffing a big fat 
goose. Aunt Katie and Manuna were 
setting the long table, and everybody was 
busy. 

" Yes, my dear, you can pick me a cup 
of raisins," said grandma. 

Ruth went to work with a will and picked 
the raisins very fast, but somehow the cup 
didn't seem to get full. 

Grandma looked up just as Ruth was 
putting a great juicy raisin into her mouth, 
and then she discovered the reason. 

" When you pick raisins, Ruth, you must 
always whistle," said grandma solemnly. 

"Why, Grandma! " exclaimed Ruth, 
"mama says it's not well-bred for girls to 
whistle." 

"If you whistle, you can't eat, my dear, 
and the cup will get full quicker ; but sing- 
ing is every bit as good, and I would like 
to hear you sing about little Jack Homer." 

And was n' t it queer ? When Ruth be- 
gan to sing that, the cup was full in a jiffy.

Quality in Grape Fruit 



IT takes time to produce Grape Fruit — it has taken time, 
skill and a great deal of money to produce such fruit as that 
grown by The Atwood Co., of Manavista, Fla. 
With 250 acres devoted to it exclusively, this company has 
learned how to raise good Grape Fruit — the finest sort that 
comes out of Florida — thin-skinned, smooth, heavy with 
luscious juice. 

A delectable breakfast fruit, it is cleansing to the system, and 
taken at night on retiring it is a splendid conservative of health. 
Cut the fruit in cross sections, remove the core completely, 
and serve with or without sugar. 

See that your dealer always sells you the Atwood brand of 
Grape Fruit, which is sold only in trade-mark wrappers.

" Now how do you suppose Noah spent 
the time in the ark during the flood? the 
Sunda.y-school teacher asked. 

"Prayin'," sa^ested Willie. 

"Fishin'," ventured Dick, 

"Humph!" grunted Willie contemptu-

It is refreshing to find Ian MacLaren 
signalizing his second visit to this couotry 
by preaching a sermon pitching into the 
prodigal son, and expressing bis sympathy 
for the brother who stayed at home, worked 
hard and was never treated to iatted calf, 
fine raiment and a holiday celebration for 
his exemplary conduct. It is just as well 
to have a good word said to the faithful, 
quiet and modest grind, occasionally, in- 
stead of wasting all our hospitality on the 
refomied rake. 



A noted coDege president, attending a 
banquet in Boston, was surprised to see 
that the darky who took the hats at the 
door gave no checks in return. 

"He has a most wonderful memory," a 
fellow diner explained. " He's been doing 
that foryearsand prides himself upon never 
having made a mbtake." 

As the college president was leaving, the 
darky passed him his hat 

"How do you know that thb one ia 
mine?" 

"I don't know it, suh," admitted the 

"Then why do you give it to me?" 
"Cause yo' gave it to me, suh." 



" The duration of the life of men may

would consist in simplifying many sides of

When you buy Lard you get more 

than you bargain for. It's 

heavier in your stomach 

than on the scales. 



Lard is a foe to digestion. If 
you had the stomach of an 
ostrich you could hardly with- 
stand the ravages of lard-soaked 
pastry. You have probably 
found this out and already given 
up the eating of pastry. *Tis 
wholly unnecessary ! Anyone 
can eat and digest food cooked 
with CoUolene^ the perfect short- 
ening. It is a pure vegetable 
product, made from the best beef 
suet and choicest vegetable oil. 

It is neutral in taste and 

odor. 




Cottolene is never sold in bulk. 
It is put up in carefully sealed 
tin pails. When you buy lard 
you have no protection as to 
quality — you simply know you 
are getting I * ""^.D — never mind 
the gr?de, ils. just L-A-R-D. 
On the o^her hand, every pail 
of Cottolene is uniform — ^the 
product is guaranteed. You 
take no chances whatever. 

In the face of these facts just 
ask yourself if you can afford to 
use hog lard when you can get 
pure, healthful, nutritious Cotto- 
lene. 



COTTOLENE was granted a GRAND PRIZE (highest 
possible award) over all other cooking fats at the 
recent Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and food 
cooked with COTTOLENE another GRAND PRIZE.

A NEW FEATURE-The pat«nt air-tivht top on this pail is 
for the purpose of keeping COTTOLENE clean, fresh, and 
wholesome; it also preTonts it from absorbing all disagreeable 
odors of the grocery, such as fish, oil, etc.

By the banks of the Merrimac river, just 
on the outskirts of Newbury)>orl, Mass., is 
a little island known as "Deer Island." 
On it is the summer home of a noted auth- 
oress, Harriet Prescott S|>offord, who 
spends the entire summer there, coming 
with the birds in the early spring, and lin- 
gering until fallen leaves and heavy frosts 
aonuunce King Winter's reign. Around 
the |)lace, sacred memories cluster, and here 
many of her liest stories were written. 'ITic 
house is historic, for in early days it wns an 
inn, a favorite resort for young people, 
who ])icnicked here in summer, or held 
sleighing parties in winter. Many a lime 
the old walls have re-echoed to the rhythm 
of dancing feet and Ihe resounding notes of 
the violin, while the darkey fiddler called 
the figures for the coliiiion and old-fash- 
ioned country -dance. 

The dining-room of this house faces the 
river, and the furnishings are old and rare. 
A Franklin stove is at one side, and on 



cold and stormy days its ruddy blaze drives 
out all thoughts of the dreary weather out- 
side. It is surmounted by a bell, vhich 
was picked up from a wreck as it floated on 
its wooden standards. These were two 
carved dragons that supported it, while it 
called the watches on board the ill-feted 

The summer home of Gail Hamilton, 
whose writings are familiar to everj^ne, was 
at Hamilton, Mass. This house, the scene 
of "Ten Miles from a Lemon," is simiile 
and old-fxshioned, but under its roof have 
gathered noted people, among them Har- 
riet Prescott SpofFord and the Quaker jwet, 
Whittier, who unbent so far as to indulge 
in a lively game of croquet with the author- 
ess. 

The dining-room, around whose festive 
board have gathered learned men and wom- 
en of every clime, is a very simple room, 
with bright hangings, and a large sideboard 
displaying Colonial silver. Over the table 
is spread a grey cover having an interesting 
story of its own.

the United Slates, to the wino-ciioler thai 
was in the possession of Roliert Morris, the 
financier of the Rcvohition. and whose oil 
painting hangs above it. The gloitcd cab- 
inet contains reliirs innumerable, and old 
china, which has .always belonged to the 
Stark family, while underneath a rare piece 
of furniture owned by Robert Morris does 
duty as a cupboard, and holds the china 
used every day. 

The first blood of the Revolution was 
shed by Joseph Sprague, who was com- 
mandant of the first imiforracd company 
of light infantry in Salem, Mass.. and who 
was one of the mer<:hants of that city; his 
house, descended from father to son, is a 
a landmark in the Witch city. 'Ilie dining- 
room is filled with rare treasures, such as 
whole sets of Canton, gih-edged Minton. 
and Lowestoft; stored behind glass doors 
in thecabinet, and on a Chijtjiendale side- 
board, rests a ((uantity of choice colonial 
silver, including pieces rarely seen even in 
the house of a collector. The chairs are 
Chippendale and were imported, when the 
home was first made, to please the first 
dainty bride of the colonial mansion. 

TheoldFerncroft Inn, which was burned 
last year, contained one of (he quaintest 



of dining-rooms, whose atmosphere carried 
the thoughts Imck to the beaux and belles 
who dined there, when it was first built in 
1692. An exact copy Is being built of the 
old Inn, (he new structure rising out oflhe 
foundation of the one destroyed. Curious 
mottoes were a feature of this house, and 
thedining-roomboastcdof two: '■ Friend's 
ever welcome, so are you," and " f^t, 
drink and be merry." Pewter chaigere 
hung on the walls, an old Wilton clock 
calmly measured the (light of time, and old 
waiters with char.icteristic scenes adorned 
the balcony overhead. The front of this 
noted inn was an exact representation of 
the Homeof.\nn Hathaway, made famous 
by Shakespeare. 

Another dining-room of note is found in 
the old Pickering house on Broad Street, 
Salem, Mass. In this house, Timoihy Pick- 
ering, who served in four different cabinet 
offices was born. He was a personal friend 
of Washington, who visited the old house 
and partook of the hospitality dispensed 
in the big dining-room. 

The house is one of the first built in the 
Witch City, and stands on a part ol the 
Governor's Field, owned by Governor En- 
dicott, and sold to Emanuel Downing, who

one to attain such perfect composure. As 
it was that first morning, so it was every 
other one, the work was discussed and as- 
signed, while we sat on the veranda, each 
person having the privilege of choosing that 
part in which she felt she needed more 
practice. After all had the work clearly in 
mind, we went into the kitchens — rooms 
with many windows and an inspiring view 
from every window. The equipment of 
the kitchens made work a pleasure. The 
numerous utensils had been chosen with 
studied care, to make the workas easy as pos- 
sible, and thus insure greater dexterity and 
accuracy in turning out finished products. 
Two ranges as well as an oil-stove added 
much to the completeness and convenience 
of the rooms. Mrs. Hill and her able as- 
sistant. Miss Blackman of New York City, 
were here, there and everywhere, giving 
words of advice or assistance at a critical 
moment when none of us felt quite strong 
enough to rely solely on our own judgment ; 
and through it all, Mrs. Hill was never con- 
fused or impatient, but always calm and 
helpful 

When all the dainty dishes were fin- 
ished, the class sat down to luncheon in 
the airy dining-room, and as a full menu 
was planned for each lesson and in suffi- 
cient quantity to serve all bountifully, we 
felt that we were being dined on the &t of 
the land. We usually arose from the 
table about two o'clock, when we were 
quite glad to go to our respective abiding 
places for rest, and incidentally to con- 
gratulate ourselves that we had come to 
South Chatham. 

So the days and lessons slipped by, each 
program being more difficult than the 
last, until we began to wonder if we would 
ever again stand in awe of any dish, no 
matter how complicated or impossible it 
might seem. 

For one lesson we prepared dishes espec- 
ially appropriate for a picnic for the next 
day. Mrs. Hill had planned a delightful 
outing for her class and their friends. The 
day was ordered for the occasion and 
dawned just as all such days should, per- 
fect in every detail Early in the morning 



the wagons that were to carry us into a 
spot desirable enough to satisfy the most 
exacting, arrived; but those places are not 
uncommon in and around South Chatham, 
for* nature has been most lavish in distrib- 
uting her favors there. The ferns, which 
grew in great profusion, made ideal table 
decorations, and the inquisitive spiders and 
ants that tumbled into a cup of hot coffee, 
(for we had cups and also hot coffee) only 
added spice to the delicious repast Noth- 
ing marred the perfectness of the day, and 
all voted Mrs. Hill as charming a hostess 
in the woods as she was in her own home. 

A short time after the picnic, Mrs. Hill 
and the class gave a reception, to which 
friends were bidden from far and near. 
The woods near by, furnished fioral dec- 
orations that many a city hostess would 
have been glad to obtain at any price, and 
while the house was being transformed into 
a veritable fairy-land, the "seven cooks" 
were flying around making ice-creams 
and cakes that would have made a caterer 
green with envy. The guests came and 
went at will, putting aside all formalities 
and enjoying the hospitality extended to 
them. This was the closing event of sev- 
eral happy weeks, made especially delight- 
ful by the intermingling of both duties and 
pleasures. Two ponds furnished boating 
and bathing as well as fishing for those who 
enjoy these sports, and the woods were full 
of beautiful walks, thus affording a variety 
of amusements. 

Before we separated, we decided to have 
one more frolic together, and chose as 
our special "stunt" a trip up Hurricane 
Mountain. Our driver and mail carrier 
again came to our rescue, with his big wagon 
and horses, and drove us to the beginning 
of the trail, when only two could ride at a 
time, as the ascent was steep and hard for 
the faithful horses. However, all were in 
good training and reached the top without 
being greatly fatigued The view was fine 
enough to repay us for our efforts — and 
while partaking of our supper, we feasted our 
eyes on a panoramic view full of grandeur. 
Directly in front of us, lay Kearsarge Village, 
North Conway, and Intervale, while in the

background, as though guarding the villages 
nestling lovingly at their feet, towered the 
Presidential Range of the White Moun- 
tains, with Mount Washington rising majes- 
Ideally over alL We tarried as long as we 
dared, feeling reluctant to turn our backs 
on a view that seemed to add new beauties, 
as the sun sank lower in the west We 
were surprised, when we turned our faces 
homeward, to find that our driver had tied 
a veritable Christmas tree to the back of his 
wagon; but instead of being able to spread 
its branches proudly, it was forced to be 
dragged ignominiously along the ground. 
Our looks of wonder and exclamations of 
isurprise brought forth the explanation that 
all were literally clamoring to hear. The 
wagon was heavy and the descent so steep, 
that, notwithstanding the brakes, it was very 
hard on the horses, so our humane friend 
had improvised this useful brake. We had 
not gone far when one venturesome peda- 
gogue decided that, if a little weight were 
good, more would be better, whereupon, 
£he added her body to the brake by stand- 



ing on the prostrate tree. Soon another 
sprang on behind her, and still another, 
until, amid shrieks of laughter the tree 
added little ripples of mirth as it slid along 
over the rocky road, and the horses even 
whispered together in their glee, that this 
was a vast improvement on the famous 
Westinghouse. The descent instead of 
being tiresome, was filled with unexpected 
pleasures, and, when we reached our homes 
at dusk, all agreed that this day was only 
one of the many happy ones spent in South 
Chatham. 

The next day trunks were packed; for 
other visits were to be made before the 
duties of the fall began. It was with great 
reluctance that we parted with the friends 
we had made and with the dear little vil- 
lage, but each felt that we were leaving 
far richer than when we came, — richer in 
health and friends and knowledge, and 
richer for having been able to spend even 
a few delightful weeks in close companion- 
ship, with teachers, fellow-pupils, and the 
residents of South Chatham. 



April 



By WINIFRED LANGWORTHY BROWN 



Dainty April shy approaches 
Clad in colors gold and green ; 

See ! along the gray horizon, 
Faintest hints of life are seen. 



Golden is the marsh with cow-slips, 
Living green the leaves they bear ; 

Yellow dog-tooth, April's hand-madd. 
Green and gold, her colors, wear. 



Golden sunshine fills the spaces 
Darkened long by wintry days, 

And o'er all it casts a halo 
Like the dream of other days. 



Crocus gold and dandelion, 

Lavish wealth of Spring's array, 

One and all have priceless value. 
Though they perish with the day. 



Golden gleams the pussy willow, 
Luring to its heart the bee, 

Golden-winged, pollen-laden, 
As he flits so busily. 



For the gold of April's riches 

Speak the wealth of hope she brings. 

And the green of her fair garlands. 
Bursting life in hidden things. 



A Box of Spanish Onions 



By HELEN CAMPBELL 



W 



HAT they need is not only 
country life for a time — all the 
time if it were possible — but 
onions, unlimited onions. ' ' 

Mrs. Alexander's delicate figure straight- 
ened suddenly and grew rigid, then re- 
laxed. The doctor had always joked far 
too much in a world holding so many mat- 
ters for serious consideration, but this was 
really carrying things a little too far. After 
aJ], though, there was nobody like him and 
he understood the constitutions of the two 
boys as no one else had ever done. This 
time his eyes held no twinkle, and now he 
repeated the obnoxious words. 

''Onions I said, and I must tell you pre- 
dsely why. There is no nervine like them, 
and I know, for this is now my third year 
of prescribing them to nervous patients. 
Bromides and the sedative business are 
nowhere compared with them, yet I and 
the rest of my profession were marching in 
the same old path until some of us listened 
to this man, the head of a great insane 
asylum, and a ceaseless experimenter as to 
the foods best adapted to his patients; a 
chemist too, analyzing, comparing, blend- 
ing this, that and the other, who found in 
the onions the gentle sedative required, 
and ended in serving them every other day 
in his asylum. Luckily his head cook had 
sense — understood what he was after, and 
cooked the bulb so perfectly that no one 
could refuse them. He lound them pre- 
cisely what I tell you — not only good food, 
but quieting as any bromide with none of 
the pernicious after effects. ' ' 

Mrs. Alexander shook her head involun- 
tarily, but the doctor went on: **This pair 
of yours, public-schooled nearly to death, 
like thousands of other children, and keyed 
up to the last degree of tension in the life 
you live, need two or three months of Aunt 
Mary and her little farm and onions, if she 
will admit the^i. She will I * 11 see her 



myself. Shall I tell her you are sending 
them along?" 

"Which? the boys or the onions?" 
Mrs. Alexander said, as she considered the 
extraordinary prescription. 

''Both, my dear madam, and the sooner 
the better, for Carl is on the way to some- 
thing much worse than nervous prostration; 
St Vitus' Dance, if it is not headed off. 
Aunt Mary is a perfect nurse, as you know, 
and you can trust her to see them through, 
if she had to turn the whole farm into an 
onion bed," and now Dr. Barnard rose, 
shook hands cheerfully, and rushed out to 
the waiting buggy. 

If the Boston Cooking-School Magaune 
were bigger, it is at this point that full details 
as to all the persons concerned would be in 
order, but unhappily for the readers who de- 
sire this, it has not yet enlarged its borders. 
It suffices, then, to say here that Aunt Mary's 
cottage meant happiness for whoever rested 
under its roof, and that Aunt Mary herself, 
a farmer from choice and a successful one, 
was also a famous cook and had imparted 
her knowledge to the young woman she 
had brought up from childhood, and was 
turning into farmer as well as cook. Three 
summers with her had made the boys cer- 
tain that nowhere else on the planet was 
there so much happiness to the square 
mile, and their thin, eager, over-sensitive, 
little faces took on flesh and color, soon lost 
again in the strenuous life that made up 
eight months of their year. Too many 
Clubs, plus too many afternoon teas, pro- 
duced the same effect on the pretty mother 
with her theory as to an all-round develop- 
ment that kept them all flying from one 
form to another. 

' ' Just bundles of bones and overwrought 
nerves all of you," Aunt Mary had said, 
when they arrived in June, looking long- 
ingly after the entirely made-over pair as 
they left her in late September.

mixture, and baked and basted till a rich 
brown, delighted the little eaters. Corned 
beef hash was treated in the same way, and 
the baked or steamed cups received some- 
times a filling of string-beans or dried limas, 
which had been soaked and then stewed 
with a little minced onion. In short, from 
macaroni or rice, up to creamed potatoes, 
the filling could always be varied, but often 
Aunt Mary gave them simply the Creole 
Onion soup they loved or a pure^ of lima 
beans cooked with the minced onion and 
rubbed through a sieve. 

Day by day the thin faces filled out, and 
the skinny little legs and arms took on 
roundness, till the last onion in the big box 
had done its work, and Dr. Barnard, who 
had watched the progress of things, rubbed 
his hands well pleased. 

"Country, of course, and natural living, 
plus Aunt Mary, has been half the battle," 
he said, ** but the big onions shall have the 
credit of the other half, and I 'm going to 



get out a special cook-book and call it 
* Aunt Mary's Ways with Onions.' " 

Creole Onion Soup, known as 
" The Boys' Favorite " 

Three large onions or one Spanish onion. 
Slice very thin and fry brown in a large 
spoonful of butter or of stock-fat When 
brown add half a teacupful of sifted flour 
and stir constantly until red. Then pour 
in slowly one pint of boiling water, stirring 
steadily until all is in. Have ready four 
large potatoes, mashed, and stir into a quart 
of boiling milk, taking care that there are 
no lumps. Add this to the fried onions, 
with one teaspoonful of salt, and half a 
one of white pepper. Let it boil fivt min- 
utes, and serve with toasted or fried bread 
cut in dice. If desired, richer stock can 
be used, but this is savory and one of the 
best of the vegetable soups. It can be 
strained if preferred, but this is not the 
Creole custom.

Good Form 



By KATE G ANN ATT WELLS 



IS not the telephone somewhat respon- 
sible for the increasing lack of courtesy 
and of good form? It is so much 
shorter process to issue a hurry invitation 
through the telephone than to send a note; 
so much easier to stop an argument by the 
excuse of the 'phone being called off (when 
perhaps it is not), than to keep your tem- 
per, face to face with your opponent; so 
much easier to recline in demi-toilette on 
the lounge and gossip through the 'phone 
than to dress up and go out to pay visits; 
so that afternoon calls are lessening and 
the use of the telephone is abused. It is 
aggravating to know some one (and you 
can always guess who it is), is holding the 
'phone for half an hour dictating an article 
when several other persons on the same line 
are waiting to send their brief orders to the 
market Also, is it dishonorable to hold 
the receiver when some one is talking on 
the same line, whereby you learn what is 
none of your business ? The telephone op • 
erator may be as honorable as the telegraph 
man, but not so all the people who use a 
line. 

Yet the telephone is only one of the 
agencies by which courtesy has suffered. 
The convenience of the postal card has also 
been abused. Often there is no personal 
address on the back of the card and only 
initials are signed. Even in the signature 
of notes we abbreviate and write ' ' Affec ," 
instead of the whole word. We jabber 
< < Hello " as we pass one another instead of 
saying — "How do you do?" We nod 
instead of bowing, and have no time to be 
polite to our elders or our superiors. We 
may be professionally patient when they are 
ill, but consider it wasted time to be pleas- 
antly polite when they are well We are, 
everybody is, so casual 

Athletics too, must come in for their share 
in the spread of discourtesy through the 
swinging gait, the awkward stride, the ultra 



short dress and the general eagerness to 
win, though the etiquette of golf, as in 
other forms of competition, is strict Woe 
betide the vanquished foe who neglects to 
congratulate the winner of a game. 

The most subtle element in the disregard 
of courtesy lies in philanthropy. People 
are in such a hurry "to do good," that 
they write you for information which may 
take you two or three hours to find out, 
and answer, and they have the outrageous 
manners to add to their request the current 
phrase, — "Thanking you in advance for 
your reply," or "Asking this of you in His 
Name, I remain yours truly," — 

It is a great deal better to be polite than 
to undertake to do so much that one has 
not time to be courteous. Typewritten, 
dictated letters, are often on the verge of 
discourtesy, but when it comes to making 
love through the typewriter instead of by 
pen, it is time to call a halt to the modern 
way of saving time, so that more of it can 
be devoted to philanthropy, which being 
always in a hurry misses its sweetness. 
Philanthropy, the wanting to make some 
one else happier, is lovely. As an organ- 
ized force it is too often curt and impera- 
tive, dictating what one should and should 
not do in a most impertinent manner. It 
lays down the law as a quick way of being 
able to get at something else. It sends out 
its reminders, — "Your subscription is now 
due, ' ' instead of making humble entreaty 
that it be renewed. It even assesses you in 
theory for so much, and condemns if you 
do not give as it desires. 

It is not for the exaggerations and futili- 
ties of social forms that one would plead, 
but for a graceful compromise between too 
stringent etiquette and none. Engraved, 
even printed, invitations, are a labor-saving 
process over hand-written notes, yet when 
an invitation is written, the spacing of the 
lines as to names and dates should be as

much observed, as the so-called balance 
and rhythm in an artist's composition. 
The real value of the arts and crafts reju- 
venation lies not any more in the beauty 
created than in its compulsion upon the 
worker to take time to produce anything 
even fairly good. 

And so just because it takes time to ob- 
serve social forms are they so wofuUy neg- 
lected. Then, unfortunately, they vary ac- 
cording to locality just as do the many kinds 
of half embraces or holding of each other's 
hands in waltzing. You can tell a person' s 
inheritances, social belongings and personal 
culture, by the way a man holds his partner 
or the girl lets herself be held. 

The variety of social forms and the dis- 
crepances in them are so manifold that in 
despair one tries to grasp the significance 
of good form as being an aggregate of all 
minor social forms compounded into a man- 
ifestation of graceful personality and fitting 
harmony of character. Still, good form, 
the singular, the unit, and social forms, 
the plural, the modes, alike demand time, 
and we are in such a hurry to be at some- 
thing else that we chafe under any kind 
of repressed activity and try to believe that 



customs are the same as good manners. 
They are not and never will be; peculiari- 
ties, personal or local, never become graces 
and most of us are so local, so provincial 1 

An American not long ago said to an 
Englishman, ** You nut men in office who 
never ask you to their houses. " ' * Yes," 
was the reply, ^* but you put in men whom 
one does not want to ask to their homes." 
It is the Englishman, who makes the pos- 
session of good form by his guests a nec- 
essity if they would frequent his house, 
otherwise he deals with them merely in 
business or politics. But the American is 
willing to elect men to official life knowing 
they are not sufficiendy adepts in social 
forms to be house guests. Who wins I 

Yet the right use or disuse of social forms 
comes easily when one possesses good form. 
That always betrays itself, not alone in un- 
conscious self-effacement but in uncon- 
scious effectiveness in always doing and 
saying the right deed and word; in "geni- 
ality, kindness and loyalty; in deep inter- 
est in all the varied elements of life," 
which shine through the unconscious grace 
and strength of a nobly-bom, high-bred 
sympathetic personality. 



Aunt Martha 



By O. a A. CHILD 



Aunt Martha, she keeps house for us, 
She 's awful good and neat. 

And say ! but she does make us boys 
The dandy things to eat. 

But my I how she does worry 
'Bout something all the time : 

Pa says her sense of proportion 's 
A little out of line. 

I 'member once when Bob and me 
Were sailing boats at night 

In the big bath-tub, we forgot 
And left the 'lectric light. 



Aunt Martha knew we 'd all be in 
The Poor-house before night : 

Pa said " It 's half a cent an hour 
To bum a lectric light" 

And once when Bob, he spilled some milk 

Right on a brand new mat, 
Aunt Martha said 't was ruined, just 

And spoiled, and things like that. 

Pa said " Nonsense, Martha, soap and 
Water *11 make it good as new," 

But there *s nothing ever happens 
But Aunt Martha's in a stew. 



Her Joel

OOD land, how I do creak ; my 
best days is to come !" sighed 
Mrsw Blodgett, as she rose with 
difficulty from the pansy-bed by which she 
had been kneeling. **As I get on in 
years I remind myself of mother, her joints 
were just as creaky, and I can't stand 
weeds any more 'n she could.** 

The rattle of wheels caused her to turn 
suddenly, in time to see the Foskett buck- 
board draw up before the horse-block, and 
she hurried out to welcome Mrs. Foskett, 
herself, who was driving, this afternoon, 
^ the reins held firmly in black mitted hands. 

"You look sort o* tired remarked her 
friend, eyeing her sharply — **kind o* 
])eaked like. Permilla Foskett, you *ve 
been overdoin' ; this entertainin' with no 
daughters to help you out has overcome 
you." 

And, indeed, Mrs. Foskett was not 
looking her usual comfortable self. Her 
small mouth curved down at the corners, 
and in her faded eyes lurked a suspicion 
of tears. But she sat erect, and, mindful 
of her responsibility, kept strict watch over 
the fat pony. 

**You know, then,'* she inquired, ''that 
I had a girl to visit me ? But of course, 
you* ve seen her around with my JoeL She 
only staid for a week, just one week, but 
I'm pretty well tired out. * * 

** I always say cattle show week is hard 
and, if you have company, it's doubly 
tryin'l" exclaimed Mrs. Blodgett, sitting 
down upon the horse-block, and winding 
up her arms in her white apron. "Tell 
me about this girl ; is she one of the 
PeDs?" 

* * Yes, ' * sighed Mrs. Foskett, * * a connec- 
tion," leaning back as she spoke and tuck- 
ing in the linen lap-robe carefully around 
her shining alpaca skirt. "Yes, Joel, he 
met her over to Washburn in June, when 
he was a delegate to that agricultural meet- 
in' , and when he learned that her ma come 



from our place, that she had visited here 
when she wan't but seven, and that she 
was related to the Pells, why, they nat- 
urally got acquainted fast. He was stay in' 
with the Du Bois's, and she lived with her 
aunt next door ; it seems May Plumb, 
that's her name, has been to boardin' 
school a sight and got pretty styUsh ; she 
has about bewitched my Joel, he — " 

"I thought," broke in Mrs. Blodgett, 
that it was as good as settled between him 
and Marietta Tabor — heard they'd been 
keepin' company pretty steady. ' ' 

"'Twas — they ^^^kept company till 
this Plumb girl come along," replied Mrs. 
Foskett in a voice that trembled visibly. 
" Oh, I ain't myself to-day, I ain't. She 
went away only yistaday. You see, Mrs. 
Blodgett, ever since my Joel got back from 
Washburn he's been talkin' and talkin' 
about that girl comin' to visit the Pells, 
and says he : ' When she does come, Ma, 
I want you should ask her to visit you. ' 
As might have been expected, she dui 
come to see the Pells, and would you 
believe it, she just spent Sunday with them 
connections — I met her to church." 

" I see her there ; " broke in Mrs. Blod- 
gett, " and had a good look at her." 

"Well," continued Mrs. Foskett, "I 
asked her to visit me. She replied quick : 
' I can come to-morrow just as well as not, 
and it 's awfully sweet of you to want me. ' 
Them was her very words, ' awfully sweet 
of me ' — I happened to catch sight of my 
Joel, and I never see him lookin' foolisher ; 
the silliest smile on his face — I turned 
away, and left the pair a- talkin'." 

"So she come," added Mrs. Foskett' s 
listener. 

"Yes, she come, and next day Joel, he 
hitched up the colt to his new buggy, and 
drove her down to the cattle show. She 
seemed real anxious to go, and next day they 
must go again, and Thursday, bein' horse- 
trottin' day, off they started a third time. 



420 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



That evenin' I thought that Joel looked 
pretty sober, but she was all smiles, and 
had lots to say about the horses, and in 
what time they run. Good land, Mrs. 
Blodgett, think of a girl bein' so interested 
as that in a horse trot 1 When I'd heard 
about enough, said I sort of stern : 

" * Our old Nell and Moll and the colt 
is all the horses I know about.' Every 
evenin' somethin' was doin'; I asked 
some of the neighbor's girls over, and 
their beaux, too; we had a candy-puU, 
and you should have heard the screamin' 
when some of the boys chased the girls 
with hot taffy. ' ' 

** May Plumb, she seemed to like to go to 
the hill behind the bams to watch the sun 
go down — queer idea, that — and — well, 
she went home yistaday. Oh, there's a 
sight of dry cake that was n' t touched, in 
the parlor bed-room — * t would remind you 
of the day after a donation party — I 
baked for two days before she come, and 
there was five kinds of cake, every night 
for supper, countin' cookies and crullers, 
but that girl, she did n't even take more 'n 
two kinds." 

"Is Joel to marry this Plumb girl?" 
inquired Mrs. Blodgett, bluntly. 

** No," replied her friend, ** he says to 
me, as we sat on the side stoop, last even- 
in', in just our old way: *No, Ma, she 
ain't suited to this life, she ain't meant for 
a farmer's wife; them little hands of her's 
couldn't do rough work.' 

" 'They couldn't,' repUes I." 

'* 'And Ma,' he continues, 'her notions 
is all different She got tired of the cattle 
show. I wanted to see those splendid 
Holsteins, the prize hogs, and those 
Jerseys from the Dill farm. The Grange 
exhibits was interestin' to m^, but she, 
why, she just wanted to watch the horse 
racin' and see the folks. She yawned 
most terrible, Ma,' says Joel, 'and she'd 
ask me who was the man drivin' the 
double team past us, and who was that 
hitchin' over there by the fence, or was 
that dark man a friend of mine ? questions 
like that. ' 

"Then I whispered in the darkness: 



'Marietta wouldn't have acted in that 
way, Joel,' and he answers, whisperin* 
too: 'don't I know that, Ma?' I sur- 
mise he thinks he ain't treated Marietta 
just right, and that he can't go back to 
keepin' company with her, after bein' 
seen so constant with another girL Oh, 
Mrs. Blodgett," — and the blue eyes 
overflowed quite — "do you know I've 
sometimes fell to dreamin' how it would 
seem to have little boys and girls with yel- 
lah hair, like my Joel's, trottin' round the 
place; I could most hear 'em callin' me 
* gramma. ' I love little ones, I do for cer- 
tin'. One day, in town, I bought a swan 
cooky-cutter, and a rabbit one, too; 'twas 
as natural as life, ears long and stiff — 
children love such shapes, — but, p'raps 
I'll never need to use 'em." 

" Don't you feel that way, don't you," 
said her friend consolingly. "Permilly, 
your Joel ain't very old yet, not an old 
bach. If he was a girl, it would be far 
different My two girls were both settled 
at nineteen, but oh, a man often takes his 
time." 

" No, I know he ain't so old," quav- 
ered Joel's mother — not but twenty- 
four." 

"You'll get a good daughter-in-law, 
mark my words," cried Mrs. Blodgett 
encouragingly — "one far more suited to 
you than this flighty piece — she must be 
a regular gadabout ' ' 

The quick rattle of wheels sounding on 
the little bridge below the house, caused 
both women to look towards the road. 
Seated in his shining buggy behind the 
black colt were Joel and Marietta Tabor. 
Joel's yellow head was bent protectingly 
over Marietta's dark braids, and her pink 
cheeks rivalled the pink flowers in her hat 
Both young people smiled at the older 
pair by the horse-block, and quickly passed 
out of sight in a cloud of dust 

"Well," chuckled Mrs. Blodgett, 
"well, Permillal" 

"Who could help lovin' my Joel!" 
murmured Mrs. Foskett, and dudcing to 
the drowsy pony, she drove off down the 
white road. 



Diet in Its Relation to Childhood, Sick- 
ness, and Old Age 

By MAR Y D, CHAMBERS 

Fourth Paper 

The School Years 



DURING the kindergarten period, 
or from three to six years old, 
there is less rapid growth than in 
the earlier years, or than in the years 
that follow, — but the physical habits are 
all becoming defined and taking <'set" 
now. This is of importance as regards 
both health and behavior. First, as 
regards health. Perhaps the physical 
habit of most importance to health is that 
of thorough mastication of the food. This 
may be encouraged by the use of such 
hard foods as zwie back, oven toast, Edu- 
cator crackers, etc ; but care should be 
taken to watch for any tenderness of the 
gums at the approach of second dentition, 
and to give food that will not cause hurt, 
should this condition exist Erect and 
well-balanced posture in standing and 
sitting should be carefully fostered, as 
should also the habit of daily evacuation 
of the bowels, either on rising or after 
breakfast. As regards behavior, this is the 
time to teach daintiness in use of the knife, 
fork, spoon, table-napkin, eta Too often 
such instruction is left to the nurse, with 
the result that the bad habits formed are 
with difficulty broken, often not until the 
approach of maturity, and the new good 
habits are consciously practiced, and fail 
to become a "second nature.*' 

The brain growth at this time is chiefly 
in bulk, little in functioning, hence the 
physical well-being of the child is of para- 
mount importance. The eradication of 
family faults of nutrition and development, 
both physical and mental, is at this age, 
quite within the province of dietetics, to- 
gether with exerdse and general hygiene, 
— diet always being the chief factor, since 



*' what we eat, we are." Later, these evils 
are less remediable. 

The food at this period should be varied, 
to stimulate the various digestive secre- 
tions ; it should be easily digested, to 
avoid injurious fermentation, or undue tax 
on any organ. When a child's food is too 
coarse, too much energy is diverted in the 
attempt to digest it, and this is at the ex- 
pense of normal growth and development 
The dishes should be daintily cooked and 
served, so as to be appetizing, as the 
nerves of taste in children are very sensitive. 
Attention should htpaid to foods contain- 
ing salts for second dentition, such as bar- 
ley, wholewheat bread once in a while, and 
cereals. 

Foods Allowed up to Seventh Year 

Proteids, Milk ishould be the basis of 
the diet, and is highly useful during the 
period preceding second dentition. It is 
said there is more lime in a quart of milk 
than in a quart of lime-water. Most chil- 
dren should have a quart a day, prefera- 
bly given warm. Junket and cream, with 
a fruit sauce, makes an appetizing variety. 
Eggs should be perfectly fresh, and may be 
given every other day, either poached or 
soft-boiled, with an occasional custard. 
Meat may be used in small quantity once a 
day. Fresh fish, chicken or a lamb chop 
are preferable to beef -steaks and roast 
beef, as less stimulating. 

Fats, Cream is of great value, espec- 
ially where there is a tendency to constipa- 
tion. Two to eight ounces daily can be 
given, on cereals, potatoes, simple des- 
serts, or added to milk. Ice cream once 
a week. Butter, at least in appreciable 



422 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



quantity, may best be omitted until the 
fourth year. Some authorities on diet 
maintain that butter, as such, cannot be 
assimilated by the system, but has to be 
converted back into cream, or emubified, 
before it is absorbed. This involves the 
curious fact, or principle of nutrition, that 
uncombined food principles, e. g. , proteids, 
fats, etc , cannot so easily be dealt with by 
the system as when they are administered 
in a natural form. 

Carbohydrates, Cereals, almost all kinds. 
They must be very thoroughly cooked, and 
may have cream added, but little or no 
sugar. Bread, all varieties when stale, and 
given in some form with nearly every meal. 
Vegetables, one green and one starchy every 
day. Potatoes preferably baked, with cream 
or beef juice rather than butter. Aspara- 
gus tips, stewed celery, string beans, young 
peas, are all allowable. Fruits in some form 
are recommended every day; the best are 
oranges, peaches, pears, baked apples, 
prunes, grapes, minus seeds, in moderate 
quantity. Berries, because of the hard and 
irritating seeds, are best deferred until the 
sixth or seventh year. 

Foods Forbidden Under Seven Years 

Proteids, Cheese, corned and dried 
beef, duck, goose, game, salt fish, pork, or 
the flesh of swine in any form, are all pro- 
hibited as being very difficult of digestion. 
Veal and immature meats are apt to cause 
intestinal disturbance. Kidney, liver, sweet- 
breads, and visceral foods of all kinds are 
over-rich in nitrogenous extractives closely 
allied to uric acid, ^d are best omitted 
from the diet Lobster and crabs contain 
the most indigestible connective tissue of 
any animal foods. Stews, sausage, and 
such made dishes are over highly seasoned. 

Carbohydrates, Hot bread, biscuit, or 
rolls, as well as pancakes and griddle cakes 
of all kinds, are unwholesome. Rich cake 
is also tabooed Of vegetables, celery, 
radishes, cucumbers, and raw vegetables in 
general, contain too much tough cellulose, 
as does corn, except when the pulp only 
is used. Such coarse vegetables as turnips, 
onions, beets and cabbage are likewise 



highly indigestible. All stale, dried, and 
preserved fruits, and fruits out of season, 
are best let alone. Bananas, cherries, and 
grapes, unless deprived of seeds and skin 
come next in order of undesirability. 

Other forbidden foods are dressings and 
gravies, candies (except home-made cara- 
meled sugar), soda-water with syrups, fried 
food of any kind, and tea, coffee and liquors 
of all kinds. 

Care taken in the avoidance of these 
foods during childhood will repay a hun- 
dred-fold in the development of sound di- 
gestive organs, and thus in the foundation 
of a vigorous manhood or womanhood. 

Children's Fancies 

Attention must be paid, not only to mak- 
ing meals appetizing for well children, but 
to humoring, without appearing to do so, 
the fancies of those who are ill, or so nerv- 
ously organized as to be "over finicaL" 
It is a great injustice to the child to allow 
it to form habits of dislike to wholesome and 
often necessary articles of food. Such re- 
pugnances often interfere seriously with 
normal development, and while reprimand 
or force may aggravate a nervous tendency, 
yet no pains should be spared to overcome 
the dislike by the exercise of tact, persua- 
sion, or reasoning. Milk, being a monoto- 
nous diet, is often objected to by the small 
people of oif r generation. A few instances 
of pious guile, successfully employed, in 
making this food relished may be suggestive 
to other mothers. 

Molly, aged seven, refused for several 
days her customary bowl of milk at lunch- 
eon. At last * * mother ' ' thought of serv- 
ing it in a tall glass, calling it a '^ cobbler," 
introducing two alluring golden straws 
into the liquid, and showing Molly how 
"naughty men in clubs, and good little 
girls at lunch" drank these queer things 
called * ' cobblers. ' ' The milk was imbibed 
with great delight, probably due as much to 

the name as to the novelty of the straws 

most of all, it may be feared, to the per- 
mitted fellowship with naughtiness. 

Doris had shown a capricious dislike for 
milk ever since she could toddle. On going 



FOR THE SUMMER'S BLOOM 



423 



to a primal y school, where the noon recess 
was too short and the distance from home 
too long to return for lunch, the little lady 
astonished the family by requesting that 
milk be provided for her noon meal, ''only 
send it in a bottle, mamma, • surely in a 
bottle." Now while most of the other 
children carried lunch in their satchels, to- 
gether with McGufTy's readers and over- 
shoes, a maid brought dainty sandwiches 
and fresh fruit to Doris every day. Now 
a bottle of milk was added, and a silver cup 
to drink it from. But it appeared that the 
consuming desire for milk in a bottle was 
due to the fascinating delight of putting 
the neck in one's mouth, tilting the head, 



and letting the liquid "gurgle" — a per- 
formance never seen by Doris until she 
went to school, when the novelty proved 
irresistible. 

Another mother successfully cajoled John- 
ny into drinking milk on recovery from 
measles by serving it in a sherbet cup with 
a spoonful of meringue on top, and caUing 
it liquid ice cream. 

Such devices, for young or delicate chil- 
dren, or those nervously organized, may be 
useful in forming a taste for simple, whole- 
some food, until it can be confirmed by a 
summer in the country, with the long days 
spent out of doors, tn the fresh air and sun- 
shine. 



For the Summer's Bloom 



By MRS. E, M, LUCAS 



TO the woman who loves flowers the 
Spring months are full of promise 
and pleasure. Hints of develop- 
ing beauty and soft, green, unfolding foli- 
age remind one of seed- plan ting and gar- 
dening. But be sure the ground is not too 
cold or too wet, before consigning the ten- 
der seeds to its care. If there is not suffi- 
cient warmth in the soil, they are almost 
sure to perish, or if buried too deeply or 
covered with a dense, heavy soil, they are 
apt to die for want of communication with 
the atmosphere. Again, if insufficiently 
covered with a light, dry soil, seeds will 
wither for want of moisture. 

Though an early start in spring planting 
is advisable, the ground must not be 
worked when wet or sticky, as it is apt to 
bake on drying. With mellow soil, well 
enriched and worked, warm earth and fre- 
quent showers, it is quite possible to have 
as sweet, as abundant and as pretty blooms 
as we may long for. 

Sweet peas every one wants ; plant them 
early in trenches six inches deep. Cover 
the seeds two inches, and as the plants 



grow, hoe in a little more soil, a small 
quantity at a time, until the trench is 
almost full. During summer give plenty 
of sun and water, and cut the flowers as 
fast as they develop, so no seeds form. 
Provide a support for them, and they will 
flower until frost lays them low. 

A few bushes of the giant spiral migno- 
nette will be found useful in cut flower 
work. The pretty fern- like tips are espec- 
ially charming with sweet peas. 

Border some beds with sweet alyssun-. 
It is nearly always in bloom, and it works 
up well in cut flower work. 

Verbenas are a constant source of pleas- 
ure and require little care, after they are 
once started. Sow seeds in open ground 
and thin out to six inches apart. Water 
freely and cultivate until well established. 
Plenty of sun brings out the vivid tints of 
the deep scarlets and purples. 

No sun is too hot, no soil too poor for 
the nasturtium. For covering stumps and 
unsightly fences, it finds a graceful mission. 
Its cup-shaped flowers, like bits of silk,

THE THOUGHT OF THE DAY 

WE are living in a wonderfully 
progressive age. Events come 
thick and fast, all for the simple 
reason that men have become so far eman- 
cipated from superstition and error. Ten 
years have passed since Henry George died. 
In his *' Progress and Poverty ' ' he gave to 
the world a new remedy for economic ills. 
Though his message was not accepted by the 
men of his day, the world is now adopting 
his opinions. His argument was simply un- 
answerable because it was true. This is what 
he wrote: 

"The more you study this question the 
more you will see that the true law of social 
life is the law of love, and law of liberty, the 
law of each for all and all for each ; that the 
golden rule of morals is also the golden rule 



of the science of wealth; that the highest 
expressions of religious truth include the 
widest generalizations of political econo- 
my." 

In his " History of Civilization " Buckle 
says, " Adam Smith's < Wealth of Nations* 
has influenced civilization more profoundly 
than any book ever written, save none." 
Adam Smith' s ' ' Wealth of Nations ' ' influ- 
enced Henry George more deeply than any 
book he ever read. Henry Geoi^e's "Progress 
and Poverty'* is now influencing the worid 
more widely than any book written since 
the ** Wealth of Nations " was printed. 

And yet it is now thought by some that 
the author of * * Progress and Poverty • ' had 
not come to realize fully what the wise and 
thoughtful are now beginning to see : ' ' That 
nature's methods are evolutionary, and not 
revolutionary; that slaves can not be made 
free by edict; that when men get the crook 
out of their backs, the hinges out of their 
knees, and the cringe out of their souls, 
then only they are free indeed. The moral 
weakness of man is the one thing that makes 
tyranny possible. ' ' 

The greatest need in the world today is 
justice, not paternalism nor sentiment, but 
the justice of the golden rule. At a recent 
conference in Chicago, called to devise a 
mode of settlement in differences between 
employers and wage-earners, a labor leader 
said: "We must not allow a paternal sys- 
tem to attain a foothold in this country. 
What the laborer needs most is not lunch- 
rooms and rest-rooms, but money to buy 
things for his family and time to read books 
and educate himself." 

In commenting on this, a well-known ed- 
itorial writer says: "The lines of difference 
in classes are not to be easily obliterated. 

Good-will between classes, good-will of 
the heartiest and truest kind, may be es- 
tablished; but it will rest on justice rather 
than on sentiment It will not take money 
from the poor man's pocket to build him an 
opera house. For there is only one ground 
of exact equality in this curiously devised 
world; that is, by doing to others as we 
would that others should do to us. Here 
we find the great bill of human rights and

obligations, where the richest and the poor- 
est may meet heart to heart No difference 
of culture, training, association, or habits, 
can change this level. Slowly, painfully, 
the world is working toward this ideal. In 
the struggle it involves human beings are 
shaped to be instruments in the evolution 
of the race. All benevolent movements, 
all ameliorating influences have their deep- 
est significance in the light they throw on 
this supreme effort to adjust the relations of 
human beings on the great principle laid 
down by the Master. ' ' 

What we want, and the world wants too, 
is not so much help, but the free, untram- 
meled opportunity to help ourselves. We 
must work out our own salvation. 



RUINOUS RIVALRY 

SIR Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the 
English prime minister, gives strong 
reasons for a full discussion of the 
limitation of armaments at the approaching 
peace conference at The Hague. H e argues 
that if it was desirable to attempt to limit the 
burden of armaments in 1898, it is still rrore 
•desirable to do so today, when the weight 
of this burden has increased enormously. 
This is the more true because * ' the senti- 
ment in favor of peace and the idea of 
arbitration and peaceful adjustment of in- 
ternational disputes have become much 
stronger. ' ' Speaking for his own govern- 
ment, the premier says: ' * We already have 
given an earnest of our sincerity by consid- 
erable reductions in our naval and military 
expenditure, and we are prepared to go fur- 
ther, if we find similar disposition in other 
quarters. * ' 

What a foolish and ruinous rivalry it is ] 
England builds one Dreadnought, and we 
provide for two, whereupon our '*kin be- 
yond the sea " — with whom war is unthink- 
able — respond by ordering three more 
great battleships. All of these will become 
junk before there is occasion to use them. 
Meanwhile our naval expenses have in- 
creased from less than ^30,000,000 to more 
than jioOfOoo,ooo within ten years. And 
all this when the American policy of arbitra- ■ 
tion, more than a century old, has been 



approved by all the great powers. 

The foregoing we clip from the Sunday 
Herald. Why may not the nations in con- 
ference agree upon some method of decreas- 
ing gradually and steadily their armaments 
and battleships ? And why may not those 
civilized governments that already approve 
of settling international differences by arbi- 
tration agree to combine forces to restrain 
an unruly state that refuses arbitration and 
ventures to trespass on the domains of 
others; no state is likely to make war upon 
the world — and succeed. 

But is it not human nature still — both 
an individual and national trait that is not 
easily eradicated — to go you one better, 
to vie with our neighbor in the race for ex- 
istence ? We must claim at least to excel 
everybody and in everything. Anyhow, who 
decides how many warships our own govern- 
ment, for instance, shall build ? This ques- 
tion is of economic importance to every man 
and woman in the land. 

And yet Dr. Lyman Abbott, in forecast- 
ing the coming century, says: * ' The era of 
individualism is passing and a new cycle of 
fraternalism will soon mould society into a 
united brotherhood, wherein the profit of 
one will be the profit of another." To us 
certainly, it seems, in ships of trade and 
lines of traffic and not in superfluous war- 
ships, lies the way to national expansion, 
fraternal relations with other states, and the 
largest profit to all. 

THE AMERICAN WOMAN 

WOMAN has ever acted a leading 
part in the world's history. Un- 
complainingly she has done her 
full share in the work of the world ; at the 
same time her aspirations for higher and 
better things have not been wanting. In 
this respect she has been in no wise a hin- 
drance to social progress. Today the lot 
of the American woman does not suffer in 
comparison with that of her sister in any 
land or age. Her opportunity for intellec- 
tual cultivation is equal to that of the mas- 
culine scLX. She is free to engage in any 
occupation or calling for which she finds 
herself physically and mentally qualified. 



426 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



while the universal respect she commands 
in social life is that of the acknowledged 
leader. A woman writes recently: 

**We hear a vast deal of the simplicity 
of Japanese housekeeping and the beauty 
of Japanese domestic life. The tour- 
ist who has spent several weeks in Japan 
— or several days ! — can tell you all about 
it. He has been in Japanese homes and 
they are '* lovely." There is only one 
bunch of flowers, or even a single expres- 
sive blossom, in a room. There is but one 
picture on the wall There is little furni- 
ture. The servants are perfect. The chil- 
dren are obedient. There are smiles and 
courtesies everywhere. 

It sounds enchanting — and when our 
statesmen add that Japan leads the world 
in education and in arms, we begin to ponder 
upon the advisability of exchanging our own 
faulty civilization for this better sort. ' ' 

But the truth is the social status of the 
oriental woman is bad, too bad even to be 
reported. The conditions of her life are 
wretched in the extreme. Compared with 
those of her western sister the difference is 
world-wide — that of the bond and the free. 
Queenly dignity is characteristic of the one, 
fawning servility, the other. 

**The oriental 'civilizations' have feat- 
ures which appeal to the aesthetic sense and 
to the imagination. They inculcate many 
high virtues. But they lack, without ex- 
ception, the innate longing for and appre- 
ciation of practical, universal justice and the 
wholesome common-sense, which, with all 
its short- comings, do mark the Anglo-Saxon 
type. 

* * It may be remembered that when a Jap- 
anese woman who had been educated at Vas- 
sar was asked how it happened that she was a 
head taller than her average countrywoman, 
she replied: ' Oh, I left Japan in time to get 
enough to eat before I stopped growing. 
Our girls are so small because they are not 
well-nourished in childhood.' 

"Wise men differ concerning the touch- 
stone of civilization — but surely one un- 
failing test is the status of woman. The lot 
of woman in England and America shines 
out with celestial brilliancy when contrasted 



with that of her unfortunate sisters in Tur. 
key, Syria, India, China and Japan. 

** Thank Heaven that we have American 
men for our fathers, brothers, husbands 
and sons! They have their faults — but 
they excel those of every other clime — and 
it is to them we owe the fact that the Amer- 
ican woman is the happiest of her sex on all 
the round globe today. * ' 



IN WAY OF ENTERTAINMENT 

TO our appeal for contributions to our 
department of Home Ideas and 
Ekx>nomics our readers have re- 
sponded well Now in addition to these 
items, which we shall continue to publish, 
we want contributions on simple and suc- 
cessful ways of entertaining in the home. 
Brief descriptions of ways of entertaining 
that have been tried and not found wanting 
will be gratefully received by us. 

Often the home-maker is no less at a loss 
as to what she shall provide in way of en- 
tertainment than she is to decide what she 
shall set before her guests at table. Some 
may find it easy to entertain, others do not, 
but are anxious to receive instruction. May 
we not hear from those who really know 
how to provide ways and means to entertain 
small and large companies on various and 
ordinary occasions. For all such items as 
we are able to print we shall be pleased to 
pay at our regular rates. 



OUR readers may have observed 
already that by the use of new 
type we are able to make no in- 
considerable addition to the amount of read- 
ing matter presented on each page of the 
magazine, giving a substantial gain of items 
in each issue. We think also our new dress 
is a little more genteel in appearance than 
the old one. We like to do good work, 
dress according to our taste and means and 
keep in the best society. In what resi>ect 
does this April number fail of being a good 
one, — a high-class publication from any 
point of view. Would that we might know just 
what our readers think of it I If it pleases 
you, show this number to your neighbor or 
friend.

Seasonable Recipes 

By JANF.T M. HILL 

IN all recipes where flour U used, unless otherwise stated, the flour Is measured after sifting once. 
When flour is measured by cups, [he cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. A 
tablespoonful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a level spoonful of such materia!. 



Scalloped Anchovies 
{Hot Mors d'muvre) 
These arc served in very small paper or 
china cases. Take two anchovies for each 
case. If saltcdanchovieslmiised, let them 
sLind several hours, or over night, in sweet 
milk or cold water to freshen them; wipe 
dry and they are ready to use. Anchovies 
jiut up in oil need simply to be wiped dr)-. 
liiitter the cases and sprinkle in a layer of 
fine bread crumlis, then add a layer of an- 
chovy picked into fine bits; repeat the hyers 
until the cases are three-fourths full. Beat 
the yolks of fotir eggs; add a few grains of 
salt (for anchovies in oil), paprika, a fen- 
drops of onion juice and a<:u[) of rich milk 
or thin cream, mix thoroughly, and [wur

ting the lii|iiid come simply lo the top of 
the crumbs; sprinkle cracker crumlis mixed 



witli melted butter lightly over the top of 
the Itread crumbs and let cook in the oven 
until the mixture is set and the crumbs are 
browned. Serve with small brown or gra- 
ham bread sandwiches. Spread the bread

and mixed with fine-chopjied gherkins, 
olives and capers. A small crisp lettuce 
leaf may l)e set between the bits of bread.

Lessons in Cooking for Youn^ 
Housekeepers 



By JANET M. HILL 
LESSON II 



Wholesome and palatable food U the fiiat slep i 
BlciU in trade, and healthy tone in literature.— 

Carbohydrates 

A carbohydrate is composed of the ele- 
ments, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, the 
last two in the proportion in which they are 
found in water. The principal carbohy- 
drates may be arranged in three groups as 
below. The letters C H O stand for the 
three elements of which this principle is 
composed; the figures indicate the number 
of atoms of the different elements that enter 
in combiiiation, in each group. 



Starch 

Dextrin 

Cellulose 

Gums 

Glycogen 



Malt Sugar 
Milk Sugsv 



Starch 



Vou are already familiar with starch, hav- 
ing washed it away from the gluten in the 
dough you made of flour and water. Starch 
is found only in the vegetable kingdom. 
It is produced by all green plants and stored, 
in varying proportions, as microscopic grains 
throughout the plant structure. 

In the laboratory, iodine is the test for 



o ability in bnuttess, 



Starch; jx)ur a few drops of iodine, diluted 
with water, into half a cup of laundry starch, 
cooked and cooled for use, and the starch 
wiU assume a deep blue color. Or you 
may grind a vegetable substance in a mortar 
with a little warm water, add a drop of 
iodine solution, and note the effect. What 
is true in this case is true of all starch mix- 
tures and is thus tested. But in your 
kitchen you will recognize starch by iis 
thickening when cooked. When you come 
to cook rice, tapioca, the breakfast cereal?, 
etc., in liquid, you will note the thickening 
of the liquid and come to know that it shows 
the presence of starch. 

Dextrin, Cellulose, Glvcogen, etl. 
Starch ultimately becomes sugar. In an in- 
termediate state it is in the form of dextrin. 
The composition of dextrin and starch is 
the same, as can be seen by looking at the 
starch group, but that dextrin is not starch 
can be discovered by the use of iodine. 
In cookery starch becomes dextrin on be- 
ing subjected to high heat, as in the cnist 
of bread. This change is also brought 
about by the digestive ferments. 

The framework of plant-, and vegetables, 
or the cellular structure that enfolds the 
starch grains, is cellulose. From a nutri-

per cent protein to 79. 7 per cent, starch 
or about I to 9. There are many things 
to influence a decision as to the nutrient 
ratio desirable in the food to be supplied 
daily by the young housekeeper, as bodily 
weight, degree and kind of activity, cli- 
mate, health, etc , but, in general, the ratio 
to be sought for in the diet of an adult is 
about I part protein to five and three-

the diet of a child the proportions axe as

The Gas Range 

Primitive man ate his food untouched by 
other heat than that of the sun. Using 
artificial heat, as a means of better fitting 
crude food substances to the purposes of 
nutrition, is a result of human culture, 
and, the higher the culture of a people the 
greater its progress in the science of food 
preparation or cooking. Different proc- 
esses in cooking call for widely differing 
degrees of heat; the food compounds must 
be retained, not dissipated and lost, during 
the changes that take place while cooking 
is going on. Thus appliances that will 
quickly respond to regulation, and give the 
nice gradations of heat called for without 
undue expense and labor, are demanded. 
When gas is available, the gas range will be 
found well adapted to the needs of the 
young housekeeper. 

llie parts of an ordinary gas range are : — 

1. Two single top burners. 

2. Two double top burners (one with ** sim- 
merer," one with medium burner.) 

3. Two oven burners (these heat both ovens.) 

4. A baking oven with movable grates. 

5. A broiling oven with movable grate and pan. 

6. Gas cocks, one for each burner and for the 
"pilot Ught." 

7. A " pilot light " for lighting the oven 
burners. 

S. A movable iron sheet under the top burners. 
9. A pipe coimecting with the chimney. 

The oven burners are in the lower or 
broiling oven. In this oven cooking is by 
direct heat. The oven is used for broil- 
ing fish, chops and steak, for toasting bread 



and quick browning of food. The baking 
oven is heated by indirect heat, currents 
of hot air passing around the oven. 

To manage a gas range: i. Learn 
which pipe and gas cock supplies fuel to 
each burner. 

2. Learn to turn the gas cocks to the 
left for a supply of gas and to the right to 
shut off the supply. 

3. Do not turn on the gas until the 
match is lighted. 

4. Open the doors of both ovens wide 
before lighting the oven burners or the 
** pilot light" 

5. To shut off gas from the range, when 
it is not in use, do not depend entirely upon 
the gas*cock of the main supply pipe, but 
keep all gas cocks of the top and oven turned 
hard to the right 

6. Keep all parts of the range perfecdy 
clean. Wash the floor of the ovens and 
the movable sheet under the top burners 
with soap and water oflen. 

7. Turn off the flow of gas the instant 
you are done cooking. 

8. Air is admitted to the burners 
through openings in an enlarged portion 
(air chamber) of the pipe near the stop- 
cocks, (this air causes the gas to bum with 
a blue and exceedingly hot flame ) . Some- 
times in lighting a burner the gas will ' ' bum 
back ' ' in this air chamber, making a roaring 
noise. When this happens, turn the gas 
cock to the right, to shut off the gas. After 
a few moments the gas will pass from the 
air chamber, then turn on and relight 

To light a gas range : To light a top 
burner^ turn the gas cock supplying the 
burner to the left, and apply a lighted 
match. To light a double burner, light 
one burner as above; turn the gas cock ad- 
mitting gas to the other burner and the gas 
will light from the first burner. To Ught 
the oven burners^ open both oven doors; 
turn the cock of the * ' pilot light " to the 
left and light the pilot light at the open- 
ing, made for the purpose, outside the 
oven; then turn the cock to one of the oven 
burners to the left and the gas will ignite 
from the pilot light; turn the cock to the 
other oven burner to the left and the gas

University to Train Housewives 



MME. ADOLPHE BRISSON, has 
made a departure from the common 
lines of educating girls. She has 
opened a university for them, and she in- 
tends to produce not women whose literary 
side alone has been developed, but women 
who are equipped to take charge of a home 
and know how to conduct it. 

" My idea is to complete and develop the 
woman, to make her more truly a woman, 
a perfect mistress of the house, a woman 
capable of training her children, of enter- 
taining her guests, a helpmeet to her hus- 



band. I want to revive the eighteenth 
century woman with all moHdem accom- 
plishments. 

'<I pitied the middle-dass girl of 16. 
She has only two alternatives open to her 
— either to follow her mother into drawing- 
rooms, play bridge and make endless visits, 
or to pursue some study at the Sorbonne 
and undergo the rigors of the baccalaure- 
ate. This sort of studies takes her far, 
very far, indeed. ' *

The Vegetables We Eat 

VERY few housekeepers, in picking over 
the vegetables in the grocery stores 
or huckster's carts, know much about 
them ; and yet, while in the United States 
vegetables grow in greater abundance and 
beauty than in any other part of the world, 
none save maize and the ground artichokes 
are native products. 

The watermelon, grown in North Africa, 
gave to us our first seeds. The musk- 
melon came out of Persia, ages ago, as a de- 
veloped table delicacy, while the Romans 
ate cabbage salad and considered it very 
good. The Greek philosophers thought a 
dish of boiled beets, served up with salt 
and oil, a great aid to mental exercise. 
Radishes originated in China, and it has 
been said that Pharaoh fed his pyramid- 
builders on radishes, even going so far as 
to spend 1900 silver talents in order to 
give his masons the crisp and spicy root. 
Again, if we read the Old Testament care- 
fully, we will find that in Egypt the chil- 
dren of Israel ate melons, beets, onions 
and garlic. 

From productive Persia came peaches 
and geraniums, while watercress was gath- 
ered from her valleys and brooks, centuries 
ago. She also taught the world how to 
grow and head lettuce. 



The Roman epicures adopted both these 
salads, and ate green peas and string- 
beans that their gardeners found growing 
in France and South Germany, while cu- 
cumbers were as popular with them as with 
the Jews and Egyptians. 

The burr artichoke was first found in 
Arabia ; and the Arabians ate it for liver 
troubles. Carrots first grew in Belgium, where 
they are considered an excellent tonic for 
the complexion. Rhubarb was unknown 
until the 15 th century, when the Russians 
found it on the banks of the Volga, while 
the egg-plant was first cultivated in North 
Africa, and is now considered a great deli> 
cacy in Turkey. 

The humble p>otato, which is now almost 
as great a necessity to some people as bread 
and butter, is a South American product, 
and had to make a desperate struggle for 
popularity. For almost a century after it 
was imported and grown in Europe nobody 
could be persuaded to touch it Finally 
Parmentier gave it a boom, which in more 
than two centuries has not diminished; 
twice this valuable little vegetable has been 
the means of saving Europe from a cruel 
famine. John A. Morris.

LAST summer, in the country, I told a 
local doctor of a long sun-bath I had 
just taken : * * I do wish, ' ' said he vexedly, 
** that we Americans understood the art of 
moderation. Sunshine is an excellent tonic, 
but I have known cases of cerebrospinal 
meningitis that came from intense exposure 
to the sun. Walking is beneficial, but 
those who go into the country and, having 
led a sedentary life at home, begin tramp- 
ing miles about the neighborhood, without 
leading up to it by degrees, are likely to 
suffer in consequence. Remember, where- 
ever you go, you must become acclimated. 
The night air, in especial, is something to 
become accustomed to by degrees. If you 
have a weak throat or lungs, never sit out, 
nor walk about, after nightfall, except with 
caution and under favorable conditions. 
If these and like simple rules are remem- 
bered, your summer outing will doubtless

minutes over a good fire, taking care not 
to burn. 

I have been able for several years to buy 
in Boston the very best meal (of course, it 
is always white), put up in six-lb. bags, 
the latter having a good representation of 
the old-fashioned Dutch windmill. 

I well remember the beautiful picture, 
many years ago, of the green hills of Ports- 
mouth, R. I. , sloping down to Narragan- 
sett Bay, and on their summits the giant 
windmills scattered here and there, looking 
weird against the crimson of the sunset sky. 
It is in some of these mills that the best 
Rhode Iskind meal is now ground, between 
large flat stones, Indian fashion, thus ren- 
dering the meal less liable to heat than by 
modem methods, and so preserving its 
sweetness. M. A. M.

Unskilled Mothers 

THE Association of Practical House- 
keeping Centers, incorporated in Feb- 
ruary, 1906, with three established centers 
in Manhattan, and one in Brooklyn, teaches 
by precept and example something of the 
art of living to all who come to its centers. 

A center differs from a settlement in that 
it is avowedly a place of teaching. It dif- 
fers from a public school in its habitat, 
which is any ordinary tenement fiat, and in 
its teaching, which is through social forms, 
in addition to the conventional pedagogical 
methods. The classes are small, the pupils 
do things and discuss as well as listen. 
But much of the most valuable teaching is 
done without classes. 

A never-ending source of interest is the 
problem of spending income. How much 
of the week's expenditure must be allotted 
to a dinner served for six, eight or ten per- 
sons ? How many eggs in a week does the 
family need to use ? If there are not eggs 
enough for all, who needs them most, the 
two-year-old baby, the father, doing heavy 
work, or the growing school-boy? What 
breakfast is best for the school-children 
when they have no appetite, after an un- 
comfortable night in a crowded room, 



where aU the windows were dosed ? These 
are some of the topics which girls discuss 
around the table with the teacher, while 
eating the meal which they have prepared 
in a kitchen precisely like the kitchen at 
home, where commonly no one sits down 
to a table, but each ix>urs boiled coffee 
from the stove and cuts bread from the loaf 
on the kitchen tubs. 

The new psychology, pointing out the 
lack of "learning by doing," as the sad- 
dest defect of our schook, finds in its cen- 
ters an experiment on its own lines. Ever>' 
moralist who discourses on the evils of di- 
vorce and the decay of family life is under 
moral obligation to give active support to 
practical home-making. Every argument 
in favor of playgrounds and organized rec- 
reation holds with added force in favor of 
these centers. They furnish legitimate 
social outlet for activity among young peo- 
ple in congested centers, as well as in dull 
country towns. They promote health and 
right living among people ot all ages. — 
Florence Kelley in The Century Magazine.

The Poetry of Hash 

LIKE everything else that seems com- 
mon, hash ii susceptible of the highest 
development There are hashes that the oc- 
cupants of the sty would spurn, and there 
are hashes again that would make a queen's 
mouth water. And here we must remind the 
gende reader of the lesson running through 
all these articles on good things to eat — that 
it is not the eggs, the berries, the butter, 
the cream, the meat, the flour, that consti- 
tute the excellence or glory of a viand — 
it is the delicate fancy, the graceful touch, 
the loving purpose, the scintillating brain, 
the smiling presence of the woman who 
does the cooking. It is these qualities 
that can take a little cold meat, a little cold 
potato, a litde cold onion, and, mixing 
them together and sprinkling a litde of this 
and that with a few delicious flirts of the 
Angers, and then singing a song into the 
simmering mixture, turn out a dish of hash 
that Olympus might crave. — Ohio State

bone and a few trimmings of veal, if at hand, 
to the liquor in the saucepan; add also half 
an onion, into which three cloves have been 
pressed, two or three stalks of celery, half 
a carrot, sliced, three sprigs of parsley and 
a tiny piece of bay leaf; let simmer an hour, 
then strain off the broth and set it aside to 
become cold; remove the fat and measure 
the broth, adding hot water if needed, to 
make two quarts. Beat the whites of three 
eggs with the crushed shells into the cold 
broth, adding at the same time, two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, a piece of green pepper 
p>od and the thin yellow rind of a lemon; 
stir constantly while heating the prepared 
broth to the boiling point; let boil from three 
to five minutes, then draw to a cooler part 
of the range; pour in half a cup of cold water 
and let stand to settle, then skim and strain 
through several folds of cheese cloth laid 
over a colander; reheat and serve. A tea- 
spoonful of sherry wine added to each cup 
of bouillon is approved as an improvement 
by some. 

Chicken Aspic 

For each five cups of broth add with the 
cggs> ct<^ 9 ^ above, one package of gela- 
tine, softened in one cup of cold water. 
The preparation when strained and cooled 
to firmness is called chicken aspic. Slices 
of chicken breast, pate-de-foie-gras, cooked 
yolks of eggs, peas and other vegetables, 
with or without truffles, are moulded in 
chicken aspic. Individual timbale moulds 
are much used for moulding small objects 
in aspic

A place might be made for cheese straws, 
if it does not give a crowded appearance to

should be set upon the table. Cheese straws 
usually accompany a salad served as acourse, 
and it would be quite as well to leave them 
upon the sideboard or in the butler's pan- 
try until the time for passing them with this 
course arrives.

Black Fruit Cake 

« 

Beat one pound (two cups) of butter to a 
cream ; then gradually beat into it one pound 
(two cups) of sugar; then add the well- 
beaten yolks of twelve eggs, and two cups 
of molasses; then one pound (four cups) of 
flour sifted with one teaspoonful, each, of 
soda and cloves, and two teaspoonfuls, each, 
of cinnamon and mace; then beat in the stiff- 
beaten whites of twelve eggs, and, lastly, 
two pounds of seeded raisins, two pounds of 
sliced citron, two pounds and a half of cur- 
rants, and one-fourth a pound, each, of 
candied orange peel and blanched almonds, 
chopped fine. If the candied peel be hard, 
let soften by boiling in a few spoonfuls of 
water before chopping. This makes ten 
pounds of cake. Baked in two loaves, it will 
require about two hours and a half for bak- 
ing. 

Preserved Watermelon Rind 

Pare the rind and cut it into small pieces; 
cover these with salted water and let stand 
over night Use a tablespoonful of salt to 
a quart of water. In the morning drain 
off the brine, rinse the rind, cover it with 
cold water and set to cook. If this 
water tastes salt, change it and let the rind 
cook until tender. Then drain and weigh. 
Take from three-fourths to a full pound of 
sugar for each pound of rind; also an ounce 
of ginger root and a lemon. Make a syrup 
of the sugar, half its measure of water, the 
crushed ginger root and the lemon, cut in 
slices from which the seeds are to be taken. 
In this syrup let the rind simmer until trans- 
parent.

truffles?" 

Mushrooms Cooked under Glass 

Bells 

Remove the stems from one-fourth a 
pound of fresh mushrooms and peel the 
caps. Melt one or two tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a frying pan, and in it soak the 
caps two or three minutes ; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, add a generous half cup 
of thin cream, cover the dish and let sim- 
mer two or three minutes. Have ready a 
round of toast in a mushroom dish, set the 
mushrooms on the toast, pour over them the 
liquid, then set the glass bell in place over 
them. Put the dish in the oven and let 
cook about twenty minutes in a moderate 
oven. Send the dish to the table without 
removing the glass bell, lliis may he 
served to one individual or to two. 

Truffles. 

The questions, **What is the truffle, 
how is it produced and how does it grow ?'* 
are not easily answered. However, the 
commonly known facts regarding them arc 
interesting. This past year, M. Emile Bou- 
langerof the Institute of France, has "suc- 
ceeded in cultivating the truffles of Peri- 
go rd by a process which is almost equiva- 
lent to artificial germination. Up to this 
time, only wild truffles have been found 
and it has been impossible to cultivate 
them by transplanting. Savarin calls the 
truffle ** the diamond of the kitchen." It 
is generally considered a form of mush- 
room that grows underground ; it varies in 
color from white, gray and violet to deep 
black, is roimdish in form and with a warty 
exterior, similar to some of the puff balk 
It has a powerful and delectable aroma and 
is used chiefly as an esculent, to heighten 
the flavor of other dishes, llie choicest 
truffles come from Perigord, France. In 
this country only the canned tuber is ob- 
tainable ; these are black in color. The 
peeled truffles bring the highest price, but 
as the peelings may be chop]>ed and used 
in sauces, etc, there is economy in buying 
the unpeeled product In use, being al-

ready cooked, they should be cut in thin 
slices and subjected to a low degree of 
heat for the shortest time possible. After 
a can has been opened and a part of the 
contents used, the remainder may be kept 
in good condition, if covered to the depth 
of half an inch or more with sherry wine. 
Being underground it is a matter of nice 
discrimination to locate the truffle, so 
trained pigs and dogs that have an unerr- 
ing scent for the tuber are used to find 
them. A pig or dog, on such an expedi- 
tion, is led by means of a ring in the nose, 
and, when the animal discovers the escu- 
lent, a few turns of a shovel brings it to 
light.

Tomato Soup 

Everybody thoroughly enjoys a rich, 
smooth, delicious soup, but it's so much 
trouble to make it and get it right. 
None can be prepared more savory and 
appetizing, more tempting to the palate, 
than Heinz Cream of Tomato Soup. 

The tomatoes in it are especially 
grovn for this product — plump and 
perfect, taken red ripe from the vines 
and prepared while fresh. No meat or 
stock is used in Heinz Tomato Soup — 
it is enriched solely by pure, sweet 
cream. The spices are of the highest 
standard of purity — and the precision 
exercised in seasoning this Heinz deli- 
cacy is not excelled in all cookery. 

It is this careful blending of ma- 
terials, our improved methods of 
cooking, painstaking care and scrupu- 
lous cleanliness that make Heinz 
Tomato Soup what it is — superlatively 
good and wholly unlike all others.

are unable to say how long it is necessary 
to cook- the same to destroy bacteria pres- 
ent in the fish and thus insure its preser- 
vation. The best way is to make a trial of 
one jar ; if this spoils, longer cooking is 
the thing needed. Secure fresh lobsters 
and remove the flesh from the shell before 
cooking ; sterilize the jar in boiling water, 
then fill it with the lobster, putting in 
tomalley, coral and all that is usually eaten. 
Set the jar on the rack in a steam kettle 
with a folded cloth beneath it; put boiling 
water below the jar, letting it come half 
way up the sides of the jar. The jar must 
first be heated or it will crack. Set the 
cover of tHe jar in place, but do not screw 
it down. Cover the kettle and let cook 
one hour ; then fill the jar with boiling 
water, put the rubber and cover in place 
and let cook another hour ; then screw 
down the cover and, when cold, make it 
tight as possible. 



Query 1238.— M. M. P., Atlanta, Ga. ** Recipe 
for angel cake. How hot should a gas stove be 
when the cake is put into the oven ? Is there any 
advantage in using a glass rolling pin in making 
puff -paste ? " 

Angel Cake 

Use one cup, each, of whites of eggs 
(about ten), granulated sugar and flour. 
Measure the flour after sifting two or three 
times. Use also half a teaspoonful, each, of 
cream-of- tartar and vanilla extract and one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of salt. Beat the whites 
until very light; sift over them the cream- 
of- tartar and beat until dry; gradually beat 
in the sugar, then sift over the flour and 
cut and fold the two together. Bake in a 
tube pan about fifty minutes. When the 
cake is put into the oven, the heat should 
not be as strong as for baking bread, but it 
should be increased to that degree by the 
time the baking is finished; or bake with in- 
creasing heat. Success in cake-baking is 
secured only by baking cake. 

Glass Rolling-Pin for Puff-Paste 

We do not consider a glass rolling-pin of 
much use in making puff-i)aste. A * * Magic 



cover," — a stockinet cover for roiling-pin 
and a piece of duck or sail cloth for mould- 
ing board, — is of great usefiilness in this 
branch of cooking. A little flour is rubbed 
into the covers and the liability of * * stick- 
ing * * is thus minimized. We recommend 
these without reservation. 



Sea-Rover's Remedy 

Postum Coffee and Its Power to Rebuild 

The young daughter of a government 
oflicer whose duties keej) him almost con- 
stantly on board ship between this country 
and Europe, tells an interesting tale of the 
use her father made of Nature's food rem- 
edy to cure an attack of malarial fever : 

''P'ather recently returned from a long 
sea- trip, bed- ridden and emaciated from 
an attack of malarial chills and fever," she 
writes : " In such cases people usually dose 
themselves wuth medicines, and we were 
surprised when he, instead of employing 
drugs, proceeded to devote himself exclu- 
sively to Postum Food Coffee, of which he 
has long been fond. He used two or more 
cups ar each meal, drinking it very hot, 
and between meals quenched his fever- 
engendered thirst at all hours of the day 
and night from a supply we kept ready in 
the water-cooler. For several dsLys his only 
drink and sometimes his only food was 
Postum Coffee, hot or cold, according to 
the moment's fancy. 

** Within a day or two his improvement 
was noticeable, and within a week he w^as 
a well man again, able to resume his ardu- 
ous occupation. 

** He first Began to drink Postum Food 
Cofl*ee several years ago, as a remedy for 
insomnia, for which he found it invaluable, 
and likes it so much and finds it so beneficial 
that he always uses it when he is at home 
where he can get it" Name g^ven by

Book Reviews 



Henley's Twentieth Centl-ry Book ok 

Recipes, Formulas and Procj;sses. 

Edited by Gardner D. Hiscox, M. K. 

Bound in cloth. Price, (3.00, New 

York: The N. W. Henley Pub, Co. 

A book of more use than this for the 
needs of every-day life can hardly be im- 
agined, compiled as it has been for the pur- 
pose of accurately and fully describing the 
processes which underlie the manufacture 
of countless articles in common use, and of 
giving selected recipes and formulas for pro - 
ducing com]>ounds that everyone must need 
at some time. Among the ten thousand 
formulas contained in this book some will 
surely be found that meet the immediate 
re<iuirements at hand. There is hardly a 
substance employed in any of the arts and 
manufactures — the |)re[>aration of which is 
not fully explained. If there is anything 
under the sun which is to be made, mended,^ 
or handled in any way, this book will give 
the details of its manufacture or manipula- 
tion. Everybody will find in its [>agcs much 
information of value, — the housewife, the 
painter, the carpenter, the metal-worker, 
the farmer, the soap and candle maker, the 
photographer, thejeweler, the watchmaker, 
the electroplater and electrotyper, the tan- 
ner, the mechanic, the engineer, and the 
manufacturer. 

Besides the wide scope of its information, 
the book is noteworthy for the novelty of its 
formulas. The recipes have been so care- 
fully selected that they are in every respect 
the latest that can hp obtained and, there- 
fore, peculiarly well adapted to modern re- 
quirements. 

The subjects have been arranged in alpha- 
betical order, interspersed with copious 
cross-references. The result is a book so 
compiled that all the information on any 
sulijcct is available at once, without the 
annoyance of a tedious search. 

Something of the character of the recipes 
given may here be mentioned. In every 
case the Editor has drawn upon authorita- 



tive works and periodicab written or con- 
ducted by specialists in their particular 
fields. Thus the processes and formulas 
on leather and its preparation, have been 
gleaned from standard sources on skins, 
hides, and tanning; the recipes for alloys 
have been collected after a thorough search 
in metallurgical literature. Indeed, so con- 
sistently has this policy been pursued thai 
the book may be considered a repository of 
expert advice on every subject of technical 
importance.

teachers. This cones |>undcnce work has 
given the text a most rigorous and efft'ctive 
test for clearness of statement and adapta- 
bility. In republishing the lessons for the 
Library such revisions have been made as 
seemed necessary to clear up all obscure 
points and to rectify original deficiencies. 

The Library is published to give the mem- 
bers of the school their course of study in 
permanent form, with indexes for ready ref- 
erence, and in binding worthy of the con- 
tents. It will also serve as a reading course 
for associate members of the school and will 
be available as a general reference work, 
making the public aapiainted with the 
character and merit of the correspondence 
courses of the American School of Home 
Economics, 

It is in hope that il may serve as an in- 
spiration and an authoritative guide for 
inexperienced home-makers; that it may 
open up a new world of interest to the ex- 
perienced home-maker and give added 
meaning and im]K)rtance to familiar tasks; 
that it may, in some measure, increa.'ie 
health and happiness, that the Library of 
Home Economics is offered. 

The volumes include : I. The House, 
its Plan, Decoration and Care. H. House- 
hold Bacteriology, in. Household Hygiene. 
IV. Chemistry of the Household. V. Prin- 
ciples of Cookery. VI. Food and Dietetics. 
VII. Household Management, VIII. Per- 
sonalHygiene. IX. Home Care of theSick. 
X. Textiles and Clothing XL Study 
of Child Life. XII. Care of Children. 
This is perhaps the first time that an at- 



temjit has been made to gather together the 
whole broad subject of home economics into 
one correlated series of volumes. Thej 
give an epitome of th& kind and scope of 
instruction given on this subject at the 
present time. Some of the volumes have 
been adopted as text books in the Univer- 
sities of Chicago, Illinois, Missouri, the 
Teacher;' College. N. Y. , and other schools. 



Timeliness of interest, aside from any 
other condition, lends esi>ecial importance 
to the announcement of the early publica- 
tion of ' ' Foods and Their Adulterations, ' ' 
by Harvey \V. Wiley, M. D., to be im- 
mediately followed by a companion volume. 
" Beverages and Their Aduherations." 
Dr. Wiley is chief chemist to the United 
Stales Department of Agricuhure. at Wash- 
ington, and his wide researches in the in- 
terests of ])urity in food commodities give 
anything he might write on the subject an 
aulhorilativencssthat is unquestioned. The 
fact that the new national food and drugs 
law becomes efl"cctive after January ist, and 
that public interest in it is now at white heat, 
will no doubt result in ijuite a demand for 
both volumes. The books will be gener- 
ously illustrated from original photographs 
and drawings.

and pretty, round leaves, will transform a 
modest dining-table to one of magical 
beauty, 'ilie seed pods are excellent, 
pickled, and are used in salads and sauces. 

Make one bed of gladioli. Plant dozens 
of them, with the crown of the bulb about 
five inches below the surface. This deep 
planting obviates staking. Give plenty of 
sun ar.d water. Border the gladiolus bed 
with white phlox or with mignonette. 

In some out-of-the-way place, scatter 
seeds of gypsophila. Its misty sprays are 
always useful, whether they be used to give 
grace to stiff flowers or to fill a bowl with a 
mass of fluffy sprays. 

Pretty vines give a dainty touch to the 
garden, as a garniture of lace to a gown. 
For quick growth and readiness in cover- 
ing an object, select the morning- glory. 
Flowers and foliage alike are gay and beau- 
tiful. 

A pretty summer-house, that proved 
a most delightful retreat in hot summer 
days, was made in this wise : Four stout 
stakes were lixcd firmly in the ground, to 
form an eight-foot square. Across the top 
scantlings were nailed to secure stability. 
The earth about the square was well 
spaded and enriched with old manure. In 
a trench, made on three sides, seeds of 
" Heavenly Blue ' ' moming-glory were 
sown thickly. When the seedlings began 
to vine, stout strings were fixed from the 
scantlings above to the ground, where they 
were tied on slender sticks and these 
thrust into the ground. The roof was 
covered with strings also, and soon the arbor 
was a mass of greenery. I'he amjile leaves 
over-lapped one another, with the regu- 
larity of shingles, forming a complete cur- 
tain, through which little sun could pene- 
trate. On summer mornings the deep 
azure flowers, in clusters of five, literally 
transformed the vines intoa sheet of lovely 
blue. A little pruning, to keep the vines 
within proper bounds, and a thorough 
soaking of the ground twice a week, with 
an occasional spraying of the vines, to re- 
move the dust, was all the care necessary,

and the grateful shade was productive of 
much comfort. 

For a more delicate vine the Thunbergia 
is useful They are profiise bloomers, and 
come in deep orange, yellow and white, 
each with a bright jet-black centre. They 
reciuire little care beyond a rich soil for the 
roots to revel in, the necessary watering 
and a pinching back of the lateral shoots, if 
they encroach too much on other plants. 
No vine is handsome, if allowed to tangle 
and twist itself into inextricable nets. 

When planting the seeds in the spring, 
make provision for fall flow^ers. The aster 
and cosmo and calendula bloom after light 
frosts have destroyed the more sensitive 
plants. 

A great dea. of taste and originality may 
be shown in making flower beds, but a 
gorgeous display is best made in beds 
that are conspicuous for having no design 
whatever, save the planting close together 
of colors that harmonize. This the gar- 
dener calls massing. Bold masses of single 
color in petunias, or verbenas are very 
effective. 

A round bed of scarlet verbenas, edged 
with white alyssum, gives a bold dash of 
color ; a softer effect may be planned in 
petunias, the varieties of which seem end- 
less in their markings and colorings ; some 
are like enormous fringed balls, others arc 
Tilth wide-petaled flowers. But it is a wise 
policy to devote one's time to a few flow- 
ers, producing a superior quality, rather 
than to have only fair specimens of many 
kinds.

Are You Fond of Frankfurts? 



If you're Dot it must be because you 
never tried Sqnlrc's Fnuikliirl San- 
angc — Gcnnaii Style. No other 
approaches this famous brand, either in 
quality or flavor. Made only from the 
beat of fresti meat, absolutely without 
coloring mattir, and havliut the charac- 
terisdc German Frankf tut flavor. 
TRY THEM KOASIED 

The most common way of cooldng 
Frankfurts is by boiling. For a change 
try routing, just put them in a hot 
oven for from twenty to thirty minutes. 
They're delicious 1 



wage, like 
our other sausage, are put up in packages, 
I lb. to the package. This makes identi- 



fication easy, each package bearing the 
label shown above, printed In red and 
green. It also insures cleanliness. The 
sausage are double wrapped, and sealed 
before leaving our bands. They shoukl 
reach you with seals unbroken. The 
advantage from a sanitary standpoint is 
obvious.

Thete*! bH the difference in the w 
Eveiy boiMekeeper knows this. 
Some ham i> tough — diy — taiteleu. 
Some it sweet — tender — delicic 
When you order )iul " ham " you are more 
likdy to get the former than the latter. 
So of course you w3 be glad to have us teU you how to get the sweet, 
tender, delicious kind every time. Here's the secret: 



Order Sc|uire's "Arlington" Ham 

Order by name, and if you are m doubt as to what you are getting, ask the 
dealer to show you the lab^ 

This not only is worth while, but it is w^ worth while. 

Why? Listenl Here's the recipe for Squire'S "Arliniton" Hams. 

From three thousand carefully selected western corn-fed hogs (the number 
handled by our estabhsKment every day) select the very choicest 

From this choice material take only such hams that are without even a slun 
blemish. 

Cure these hams by a private process used by John P. Squire & Company for 
over sixty years. 

The lesuh is a "mild smoked, light sugar cured ham," tender, delicately 
flavored and never varying in quality. 

Sl]Uire's "AriinKton" Bacon b prepared with the same scrupulous care and is 
equally desirable. 

You are invited to visit our model packing house at East 
Cambridge. Every pari ol our immense plant is open for M I qqIt '

FROM EDITOR TO READER 

I AO riot order agents to stop your subscriptions. This is no 
-■— ^part of their business, and nine out of ten of these orders do 
not reach us. Send a card or letter direct to this office and it will 

receive immediate attention. 

In writing the magazine do not fail to give your original ad- 
dress in full. We are constantly receiving letters, some contain- 
ing money, which we can not answer, simply because they bear no 
proper signature or address. We can not locate the writer. 

Every housekeeper who is interested in her work wants to sub- 
scribe for the CooKiNG-ScHOOL Magazine. Why ? Because every 
housekeeper wants to be an efficient unit in her place and calling 
in life. 

Last month a young woman sent us fifty-nine new subscrip- 
tions. She said her pleasure in taking'these consisted chiefly in 
anticipation of the premiums she was to receive in com^»ei;sation. 
According to her choice she received three Chafers including the 
trays, one of which was the very best of its make, and three books, 
and one renewal of subscription. We would that many of our 
readers might be pleased to favor us and profit themselves in this 
same line of effort. Others can do just as well; 

Buy advertised goods. Do not accept substitutes, or things 
called just as good. We take pleasure in recommending to our 
readers the goods that are represented on our advertising pages; 
we are, also, pleased to give additional information in reference to 
the same, whenever this is desired. Note that the advertisements in 
the CooKiNG-ScHOOL Magazine are not hidden in a mass of general 
or miscellaneous matter. The articles we present are special, 
choice, and high-class in kind and quality.

ADVERTISEMENTS 



Mrs. Rorer's Cook Book is not a 
compilation of odds and ends — 
shipwrecked fragments of cookery. 

It is the work of a master mind and hand, and every- 
thing is Mrs. Rorer's own. She has, furthermore, cooked 
everything into a dead certainty. 

By the by, there are two cook books. One is the 
old standby, Mrs. Rorer's Philadelphia Cook Book, of 
which over 130,000 have been sold, and the other is 
Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book, a little more advanced 
perhaps in its teachings. Both are good and easily 
within the grasp of any housewife. 

If you are a beginner in the work of housekeeping, 
take the Philadelphia Cook Book. You will never 
make a mistake in anything you undertake if you fol- 
low directions. All the experimenting has been done 
for you and your success provided for. 

If you are an experienced cook, then you might 
want the New Cook Book — or if you have one book 
you want the other to supplement it. No matter which 
way you solve it, or which book you take, you get the 
greatest amount of cooking goodness ever put between 
the covers of a book. 

Remember you cannot fail in these recipes.

Apple blossoms pink and white, 
Trees of tender green; 

Violets hiding in the grass, 
Afraid of being seen; 



Sunbeams dancing in the path, 

Birds upon the wing; 
Long days and happy days, — 
Aren't you glad it 's spring? 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Lake Como, upon whose shores are the es- 
ates of millionaires, nublemen and prince s 



Sialue of Dante and Beatrice 

Even the mountains surrounding Como have 
a less rugged look, are more proper and 
symmetrical, and accord more fully with the 
easeful air of the villas. Of these villas, 
Melzi, one of the most famous, possesses 
sumptuous gardens and many works of art. 
Lake Como surfeits with riches, and this mag- 
nificent country-seat is only one of many 

For those, who do not enjoy " unwieldly 
wealth and cumbrous pomp.' ' and who are 
interested either in the natural beauty or in 
the people of this lovely region. Lake Lu- 
gano will offer far better abiding places. 
Here one may get sweetest visions of moun- 
tains, clouds and water, and, at the same 
time, may come in contact with peasants 
who will, to an attentive ear, 
their artless tales relate. "The 
short and simple annals of the 
poor " they often are, and even 
when unspoken they may be read 
in the pinched and toil-warped 
bodies; for one does not see in 
northern Italy the gay beggars of 



its limits, it is a good center for excur- 
sions in all directions. Its climate is also par- 
ticularly favorable. On its border 
is Ml San Salvatore, which every 
tourist must ascend, in order to 
get the view it offers of the lake 
vicinity, the distant Rheinwald, 
and the chain of Monta Rosa, 
with the Matterhom. " Every 
tourist must ascend," but the 
artist will do so with astonishing 
deliberation, pausing almost be- 
fore he is started to sketch a group 
of stone houses, with tile roofs, 
grotesque chimneys, projecting 
rafters, quaint pigeon-hole win- 
dows, flowers and vines. 

Perhaps there are life figures, 
also. Indeed, there are almost 
certain to be, for the slopes of Ml Salvatore 
have numerous villages and much travel 
back and forth to the markets of Lugano. 
The women wear heavy ear-rings and pL-iin 
dresses and, when shod at all, it is with 
wooden sandals and clean, stout woolen 
stockings. I once observed an old woman, 
stooped and gray, using in one hand a mat- 
tock — a substitute for our plow — and in 
the other hand, a cane, without which she 
seemed unable to stand, I saw this same 
woman leave the field, mow the grass in the 
adjoining meadow, fill her long basket with 
hay and carry it home upon her back. Her 
home was in one of the mountain-side vil- 
lages; the people who dwell upon Ml Sal- 



thesi 



iith. 



The city of Lugano is itself, 
perhaps, the best place for estab- 
lishing one's residence, as it fur- 
nishes any kind of entertainment 
which the tourist is prepared 
to pay for; and, besides hav- 
ing many points of interest inside

brush, heaped four or five feet above her 
head. She had gathered it in the woods 
and was taking it home where it would be 
useful. Sometimes such brush is piled ui>on 
the leaky tile roofs; often it is used in mak- 
ing window shades, which are astonishingly 
neat. Branches of the thorn trees serve 
for barbed fences and grape vines are used 
for ropes. Pieces that cannot be used in 
any other way will always do for fuel. Thrift, 
thrift, thrift ! Everywhere there is evidence 
of thrift Men and women spend whole 
days in the forests, removing moss and in- 
sects from the trees and evincing the deep- 
est concern about the preservadon of the 
native woods. 

There seems to be no kind of labor in 
which these Salvatore women do not engage. 
I recall a peasant girl who, after 
bringing the goats home from 
pasture, sat down to lace-making, 
showing dexterity thereat, which 
the ladies of our laud would be 
proud to possess. 

Many women are employed 
also, in feeding silk worms, and 
the Lugano markets are crowded 
with baskets of cocoons. The 
mulberry trees are picturcsijue in 
their nakedness, after their leaves 
have been stripped off for the 
worms. One day as we rested 
upon the mountain-side, an aged 
woman observing our attention 



to her work brought an apron-full of leaves 
and wriggling wonns, which she uncere- 
moniously emptied into our laps. 
She was greatly amused at the 
seeming diminution in our inter- 
est. The creeping things did 
not object to strange company, 
but continued their greedy feed- 
ing- 

The people of ML Salvatore 
are essentially Swiss; some of 
their near neighbors are essen- 
tially Italian. The town of Gan- 
dria, also upon Lake I.ugano, 
represents the Italian side. It 
is a strikingly interesting village, 
built upon tlie side of ML Br4; 
and its inhabitants are interesting, too, 
though their condition is tar from enviable. 
There are no evidences here of that frugal- 
ity and prosperity which enables ML Salva- 
tore peasants to wear good stockings and to 
invest in shining brass kettles for the use 
and adornment of their kitchens. In Gan- 
dria the problems of life have become pain- 
ful. Men, women and children have bare 
feet and often sore and soiled. Their kitch- 
ens are but a beggarly account of worthless 
odds and ends. The streets of the village 
are simply stone passage-ways leading up 
and down the mountain; and over these, 
the hard working people are constantly 
moving with their burdens, evincing some 
of the drawbacks in cultivatinga "perpen- 
dicubr farm ' ' with hard and stony ground.

Yet in spite of all this squalor, the bright- 
canopied piazzas of restaurants, which over- 
hang the lake, are gay and enticing. Cen- 
tury plants are abundant and carnations 
push their roots down between the rocks 
and thrive. Row boats rest beneath the 
floors of dwellings and everywhere are 
moss-covered walls, gables, angles and 



arches and — beauty. Everywhere are 
dirt, hardship, toil, poverty and — misery. 
The only line which the guide-books can 
spare to this interesting spot is, ' ' Gandria, 
with its gardens borne by lofty arcades." 
Thus its repose is undisturbed and the 
crowd of tourists pass by on the other 
side.

Straying, swinging in the treetops. 
Cuddled close in wondrous nest, 

AH the wee birds now are sleeping 
'Neath a mother's downy brea^^t. 



Little lambs that on the mountain 
tiamboled all the long day through, 

Now within the fold are resting. 
Nestled near the parent ewe. 



In the meadows all the daisies 
Have shut up their pretty eyes, 

And with drooping heads are dreaming 
'Neath the walls of Paradise. 



So, my darling, while I rock thee 
Slowly, gently to and fro. 

Follow where the birds and 
And ihe gentle lambkins go. 



I Muritlo's Fresco 



Art of the Hearth 



B\ MRS. MARGARET L. SEARS 



THE scenes surrounding the hearth 
have always been among the favorite 
themes of the painter. Before the 
improvements, so called, of tbe present day, 
the vast fireplace was the focus of all house- 
hold activity, and held a charm for the be- 
holder, as well as the worker. 

Among the Italian painters wc find very 
few Rreside pictures. Closely connected 
with the church as their art was. it found 
e.\])ression almost entirely in religious sub- 
jects, which are depicted in great numbers 
in the various churches. 

Of the many Biblical stories which we find 
represented, the principal subject, which is 
of a distinctively family character, is the 
Nativity, and in the Nativity, there was no 
fireside ! 

With the exception of I,a.>it Suppers and 
the feasts painted by Titian or Paul Ve- 



ronese there is little to suggest the hearth in 
Italii'n art. 

The French, although having the oppo- 
site reputation, are very fond of the honae, 
and some of their artists have painted scenes 
about the fireside that are exquisite in sen- 
timent 

Chardin and Millet, particularly, have 
presented scenes from home life that can- 
not be surpassed in delicacy of feeling. 

The English, although a nation of home- 
lovers, have few painters of the fireside, 
most of them preferring scenes of ceremony 
or portraits of dignitaries. 

Wilkie has i^ainted interior village scenes, 
usually of humble festivals; and while 
Hogarth's works abound with scenes con- 
nected with the home, his subjects are too 
exaggerated and of too disagreeable a char- 
acter to express the beauty of ideas that 



A Deep-woods Problem 



By HELEN CAMPBELL 



THE situation was a serious one. 
Here were the three- boys clam- 
oring for the favorite camp in the 
deep woods as soon as school ended, and 
the certainty that nothing could be better 
for them, as each year's vacation had 
proved. But here also was the older sister 
just recovering from long and serious ill- 
ness, nominally cured, yet depending upon 
unlimited hot water as one part of the heal- 
ing process. 

Now hot water and the deep woods are 
two facts incompatible and non-adjustable. 
The lake of their camping ground served 
as bathtub, and the portable camp stove, 
used in last year's tents, held a teakettle 
and little more, and to fill even the rubber 
folding tub would be nearly impossible. 
There were also two partial invalids to be 
considered, for the two **grippy cousins," 
as they were called, would arrive in Au- 
gust There were visions of an enormous 
kettle that might be hung on a pole over 
the fire the boys could keep below, but 
their countenances were dark as they re- 
flected on the number of pails of water to 
be brought up the steep little ascent from 
the lake shore. In short, how to combine 
the comforts of civilization with the degree 
of primitive life the camp stood for was the 
puzzling question and all wits were at work. 
Then came an evening in which a wander- 
ing uncle arrived, listened to the problem 
and pulled a letter from his pocket 

"Rather curious that I should happen 
to have this, * * he said, * ' but it can' t be very 
far from your camp. Have you heard of 
it? It's a new start, a hotel, you know. 
There's another, but twenty miles from 
your old camp I should say." 

* * But we don' t want a hotel, you know. 
The boys must have a chance for their tent." 

"This isn't a hotel ; that is, it specifies 
a large cottage some little distance from the 
house, with three bedrooms, a big living- 



room and a bathroom with hot and cold 
water. The bookkeeper told me abo'it it 
and gave me the letter." 

"But how can it be? There must be 
some mistake. It's impossible, I should 
say, ' * the father insisted ' * I know the sort 
of water supply in these advertised places, 
— mere driblets. * ' 

"Write and get full details then," the 
unde said resignedly. "Here's the ad- 
dress and to hear directly may settle yon one 
way or another. You' ve got to decide. ' * 

That was certainly true, and thus a note 
requesting immediate and full reply went 
into the letter box, and they waited impa- 
tiently, in the meantime, still speculating 
as to possibilities for the tents. Three 
days later it came and with it the tale of 
the cottage but recently acquired by the 
hotel, built by a man who hated hotels 
and who therefore gave it up, when the 
new one was finished, but who had piped an 
unfailing spring into the house, which had 
an equ^ly unfailing supply of hot water. 

"Some engine or other I suppose," 
said the father, still shakii\g his head dubi- 
ously. " In any case we'll take it and see 
how it's done, and now to be off ! " 

Two days later, after a long drive from 
the railroad station, they reached the hotel 
and were led at once a quarter of a mile 
further on to the cottage, fascinating to a 
degree; all bark on the outside, and all 
railings and pillars of bark-covered wood ; 
a wide veranda on three sides, big enough 
for a troop, and within the house natural 
wood, a broad window, both east and west, 
with deep window seats, and the end of 
the room finished as dining-room with cor- 
ner cupboard for china and such other 
uses as simple housekeeping might include. 
.An immense open fireplace with broad 
stone chinmey, in which a fire laid ready 
foir lighting, promised instant comfort, for 
the late afternoon was raw and chilly.

A DEEP-WOODS PROBL 



"We had afire here part of the day," 
the guide said, as he stooped to light it 
"Enough to warm up the walls and take 
out any damp. But it's dry as need be, 
as soon as it's opened up," and he stood 
for a moment rubbing his hands, as the 
fire leaped up the great throat of the chim- 
ney, about which they had all gathered, 
glad of the friendly warmth. 

"But the bathroom, the bathroom, 
where is that ? " the mother said. 

"Just back of the chimney, madam," 
the man replied, pointing to the door; 
and there it was, big as three city bath- 
rooms, perfectly appointed from porcelain 
tub to fittings, and as they turned the fau- 
cets for the crucial test as to hot water, 
hot water there was beyond any further 
doubt, but none the less a mystery, for the 
guide had left without further explanation. 
A search for the source proved useless. 
In the comer of the bathroom, it is true, 
there stood a hot-water boiler, entirely iso- 
lated it seemed, hot to touch and giving 
out hot water when the faucets were turned. 
No stove, no engine run by petroleum or 
gasolene, no anything that could account 
for it Hot water pipes might be laid 
even the quarter of a mile between them 
and the hotel, but even with well-jacketed 
pipes it could hardly remain hot. A mys- 
tery, and they went to bed discomfited. 
With daylight, however, the youngest boy, 
who planned to be a civil engineer, began 
a tour of discovery as soon as dry from 
his plunge in the lake, and presently an- 
nounced it with a shout. Light had come. 
Two pipes discovered themselves project- 
ing diagonally from the side of the boiler 
downward toward a partition between the 
bathroom and a bedroom in front, opening 
from the living room. Through the par-

Life in a Mining-camp at Tombstone, 

Arizona 

By MABEL BRO STROM 



MY first introduction to mining- 
camp life came one year ago. 
During the past year I have been 
entertained by a phase of living never 
before experienced. I say entertained, 
since, to say the least, some of our experi- 
ences have been truly amusing. 

The first thing we had to learn was the 
new word, "shift," and to note when the 
passers-by were coming off or going on 
shift. This one could teU by the swing of 
the lunch paiL In this cainp there are 
three shifts of eight hours each. One 
begins at eleven o* clock at night and is 
called the graveyard shift. This is dis- 
liked by all and each two weeks the miners 
are changed. The whistles blow day and 
night to mark the hours of shift. 

The way of living, i e., the domestic 
side of the miner* s life, seems to one, un- 
accustomed to it, very odd. The hours 
kept depend on which shift the man of the 
family is on. Should he be on the seven 
A. M. , everything passes as in an ordinary 
home ; but if he be on the three o'clock, 
or the graveyard shift, it means a disor- 
dered daily program. The family have 
breakfast when the household is up or one 
at a time ; lunch is scarcely thought of and 
the dinner hour is the hour before the 
* * shift ' ' begins, or when the miners come 
off. 

As a whole, there are in the camp two 
distinct classes; one thinks it a duty to 
spend every cent of the past month* s earn- 
ings and to have as many bills as the stores 
will allow, to dress in the latest fashion 
and live on the best the market affords. 
They invariably say, **we will have the 
best, whatever it costs." The other class 
takes a decidedly opposite view. They 
are here to make money, to save and move, 
at some time, to a more desirable place. 



They are practicing the dtmost economy 
and ** doing work on the side.*' 

This * * doing work on the side * ' assumes 
many different forms. One miner has 
learned to sole shoes and has a shop in a 
down-town store, where he repairs the 
soles of his brother miners, while he is off 
shift. His family live, perhaps, in the back 
of the shop. Another weaves rag carpets 
and earns considerable at this trade. The 
carpet being such a serviceable one for our 
simple homes. Another plays the piano in 
the saloon, at night, and still another has a 
bakery ; his family also live in the back 
of the shop. Some raise canary birds, 
or Belgian hares, while many have hens 
and sell eggs at one dollar a dozen ; or 
they keep cows and sell miUc, while others 
live on the outskirts of the camp and raise 
garden truck. The wives of the miners 
who can sew take in sewing and make 
dresses. Canvassing of some sort also is 
very popular among the women, and the 
more industrious visit the adjoining cam])s. 

"Doing work on the side" has found 
its way into the homes of the officials of 
the mines; the wife of one does drawn- 
work, point lace, eta , and sends it to Los 
Angeles for sale. Another does pyrogra- 
phy, and another takes orders for a suite- 
house. It is remarkable in how many ways 
time may be turned into money, when one 
is living away from all amusements. 

But let us go back to our more extravagant 
friends and see how they live. While their 
husbands are on shift what are they doing? 
First, let me say, they are women who know 
no other lifef than that of the mining-casnp 
and have no outside ambition. They do not 
begin their day until their husbands have 
been long gone to work. Much time is 
spent at the toilet, then they pass an idle 
day in visiting with the next-door neighbor

HOW BET LOU KEPT THE O] 



or in going to visit some distant friend. 
They exchange the latest gossip and return 
home in time to have dinner, when the men 
come off shift. With an early dinner the 
family are ready and dressed for the even- 
ing promenade, the men having bathed 
and dressed, throughout, before dinner. 
Both men and women wear the best of 
clothes. They buy entirely from mail- 
order houses and get the best and latest 
style in all things. 

Sunday to the miners is quite like any 
other day, the only variation being that they 
go out to dinn^ — to the restaurant. The 
family usually attends church, not, in every 
case, from a religious motive, but it offers 
a place to visit. However, this camp of a 
few hundred people is able to boast of four 
churches — Catholic, Episcopal, Christian 
Science and Congregational. 

Occasionally a * * show * ' comes to town, 
performs at the so-called opera house, then

THE decree had gone forth ! The 
mayor had affixed his signature 
and set the seal of the city upon it. 
AU the weeds and trash must go. 

With the yellow fever in several gulf port 
towns, it was important that this southern 
city not only maintain a strict quarantine, 
but that it be made as clean and healthful 
as possible. So good citizens had been 
working with a will, trying, it seemed, to 
rivrJ tha famous Spotless Town. 

But a very black spot still wiis Bet Lou' s 
home, the two-roomed cabin down in the 
hollow near the gas works. Once there had 
been whitewash inside and outside the

In a moment more he was fiying down

Then she toppled over weakly into the 
big clothes basket on the floor beside the 
railing. 

* * O I' se gwine get ' rested. Jaspah John-

Rising up in the basket she surveyed the 
royal crop of weeds waving at her from every

small black fist at them, she said: 

** You ain't daddy's weeds, * cause' n he

nerveless little black lump of humanity 
stricken down by the new and awful city 
ordinance.

like dis ! But mebbe, if de perlicemen fin* 
me cuttin' de weeds, dey say, * She' s er 
doin' ob hit ! Gib huh time.' " 

It was a happy thought Instantly the 
little body stiflTcned and sprang forth to do 
battle with the weeds and the city fathers. 
Armed with a rusty carving knife she was 
soon at work sawing on a big ragweed by 



the gate. The weed was tough, and the 
knife bent weakly. In disgust, Bet Lou 
threw it down, grabbed the weed with both 
hands, and gave it a vigorous jerk. Up it 
came, bringing a chunk of damp earth. An- 
other, and another, and soon quite a little 
clearing appeared in the weed forest. She 
glanced up the street, almost hoping to see 
the patrol wagon coming, so that the police- 
man might witness her brave efforts, but 
there was no wagon in sight 

Her best enemy wasy however. Shuffl- 
ing down the hill came ** Roosha" Tod- 
hunter and her little sister Pearlie May (a 
smoked pearl she surely was ! ), coming for 
their daily quarrel with the sharp-tongued 
Bet Lou, who "fussed," as she did her 
house work, with rare energy. Their quar- 
rels were always interesting. 

* * Whut you doin' ? ' ' demanded Roosha, 
drawing near. 

Now it would never do to let her arch 
enemy know that she was about to be ar- 
rested, so Bet Lou lied promptly. 

* ' Jes* a tryin' ter see how big a pfle o' 
ragweeds I can mek. ' ' 

"Huh ! Dere's mo' jimsons and cockle- 
burs* n ragweeds. A heap mo?" asserted 
Roosha, anxious to start the trouble at 
once. 

"Bet chu I" 

"Betchu !" 

"All right ! You an' Pearlie May pull 
jes* jimsons an' cockleburs an' pile 'em up 
yander, an' we'll see ! " 

So three pairs of tough little black hands 
went to work with a will, and the quarrel 
went on merrily. Bet Lou knew very well 
that she must keep it going or the new game 
would cease, so she abused her visitors, 
pulled "rags" as fast as she could, and 
glanced up furtively every now and then to 
see if the patrol wagon was coming yet 

As neither side would touch any weed ex- 
cept those of her special kind, the yard soon 
took on a comically half picked aspect, while 
the piles grew steadily. 

By and by, tiring of the hard labor, the 
enemy suddenly declared they had **beat 
a' ready," and began throwing sticks and 
stones to prove it Whereupon Bet Lou

The Next Thing 



By KATE GANNETT WELLS 



TO do the next thing, whatever it is, 
may be just a matter of administra- 
tive ability in which system perpet- 
uates itself, as in the management of great 
estates and of houses, where, in addition to 
each one of the thirty or forty guests, there 
is a lady's maid or a valet, not to mention 
a chauffeur for each visitor. Yet house- 
keeping usually runs more smoothly in such 
establishments than in small flats, for super- 
vision is everywhere and next things follow 
automatically. 

Yet surely such ability to do is more than 
another phase of general helpfulness or of 
such youthful zeal as led the Crown Princess 
ot Roumania, in her girlhood, when on her 
father's flag ship at Malta, to help the ship's 
cook in his duties. The story goes that her 
specialty was the frying of ham and eggs, and 
that on one occasion she fried fifty eggs and 
fifty slices of ham. 

It is the force of character, enabling one 
to do the next thing as a matter of course, 
which is far more than administrative ability 
or the desire to be helpful. It is a moral 
and intellectual possession, which, being on 
hand, becomes the most blessed anodyne of 
perplexity, illness and sorrow. If there were 
not always so many next things, it would be 
harder than it is anyway to be sick, but 
there is always the next tonic or the next 
bit of food to be taken, and so the invalid' s 
day is bridged over by a series of next things 
to do. 

Then in sorrow there is always a chain of 
next things, home details, business, read- 
justments of self and belongings, that have 
just got to be settled, no matter how hard, 
needless or impertinent seems the demand 
that they should be done. Just the daily 
care of ourselves commands the doing of the 
next thing; the hair must be brushed, the 
dress must be mended, even if one's heart 
is aching. That so much of this doing is 
automatic makes it the easier to be done. 



Time, at least, is used up in the unconscious 
doing, and that is something. And then the 
way the big perplexities get solved while we 
are doing the little next things. Money is 
lost, wrong is committed, but, ' while the 
misery of it all is being endured, there is 
the need of going to bed, of getting up in 
the morning, of putting up with cheerless 
meals or no meals, of going without the car- 
riage drive or the new dress, of enduring one 
or another snub, wrong valuation, or scrougy 
overreaching in another's attempt to force 
one's hand. The enduring of each separ- 
ate thing is the doing of the next thing. 

Enduring must oflen be hitting back, giv- 
ing as good as one gets, but, at least, it is 
action, while meek acceptance, resignation, 
as some people call it, is enervating, de- 
structive of all the tissues of bodily and 
mental health. Every thing does not have 
to be done all at once. It is always one 
thing at a time, though the interval between 
one thing and the next may be almost un- 
noticeable. Still there is the interval for the 
next bracing of one's self, and in such suc- 
cession of things is bred the ability to do 
each one. There is always the getting ready 
for the climax, the climax, the reaction and 
then the slow building up again of strength. 

It b doing that keeps us going. Just be- 
ing supine and accepting is a mean kind of 
treachery against the capacity for courage, 
that, innate in more or less degree with 
each one of us, grows by accretion of itself, 
if we don' t stifle it by inaction. If we can 
only do a mite of a thing, do that, and the 
next time do a bit more. 

There are no words stronger and simpler 
than those spoken to a friend by Willie 
Robins, the' blind, deaf-mute girl, who grad- 
uated last June from the Perkins Institu- 
tion, the School for the Blind in Boston, 
Massachusetts. To conquer the next, and 
then the next thing has been her achieve- 
ment for many years, from the time she i^'as

individuality of the horde put into their 
care, or doctors and nurses who feel that 
those they minister to are other than 
" cases, " from whom they will derive money 
profit, and can experiment upon for fame. 

So, considering this, — and, if it be 
doubted, turn to the voluminous columns 
of advice in answer to letters which news- 
papers and magazines are asked to give to 
seeking humanity, — it is surprising to 
think of a time when doctors were classed 
with cooks, as persons devoted to the 
business of feeding people, and keeping 
them well, by working together. If we 
trace English cookery back, we will find 
that doctors of medicine were interested 
in culinary matters, and all that concerns 
the diet of their countrymen. 

Was not Dr. Kitchener, in the nineteenth 
century, an authority ? And were not Drs. 
Hill and Hunter well known, in the eight- 
eenth ? * * Hannah Glasse * ' was really Dr. 
HilL Dr. Maguire and Sir Kenelm Digby, 



in the seventeenth century, had set a like 
example. Again hear what Dr. Lister, 
physician to Queen Anne, wrote, ''I do 
not consider myself as hazarding anything, 
when I say that no man can be a good 
physician who has not a competent knowl- 
edge of cookery." 

In fact, in ancient times, cookery was 
accounted a branch of medical science. 
The Latin verb, "curare," signified to 
dress a dinner, as well as cure a disease. 
One funny survivor of this idea is known 
on board ship, where seamen invariably dub 
the cook with the title of " Dr. " 

That old MS. of bygone centuries, 
known as the Forme of Cury, translations 
of which may be found in most libraries in 
the publications of the early English Text 
Society, tells us that it was compiled ''by 
the Master Cooks of Richard II, under the 
assent and advisement of the Masters of 
Physic and Philosophy that dwelleth in the 
King's Court." 



Diet in Its Relation to Childhood, Sick- 
ness, and Old Age 

By MAR Y D, CHAMBERS 
Fifth Paper 
School Children 



A FRIEND of mine is fond of saying 
that the American Public School is 
one of the most wonderful social in- 
stitutions the world has ever seen. It cer- 
tainly seems to be an integral part of the 
child's life, and to be accepted as naturally 
as second dentition. Few of us realize that 
school life is unnatural, and no small drain 
on the vitality. Confinement, impure air, 
restraint and study, demand constant watch- 
fulness on the part of the parent or guar- 
dian for signs of nervous fatigue or physical 



strain. Again, the development of the child 
is rhythmical, a period of rest follows one of 
unusual growth, — while the school curric- 
ulum is on a constantly ascending plane, 
making increasing demands when nature 
has planned a time of physiological rest 

For convenience in dealing with the sub- 
ject, the school period may be divided into 
three parts, — the earlier, up to nine years 
old; the middle, from nine to twelve; and 
the later, the period of puberty and early 
adolescence, the most important of alL 



DIET IN CHILDHOOD, SICKNESS 



Earlier Period. Special Charac- 
teristics 

The child is losing his first teeth, and 
permanent ones are coming; this is, to quote 
an autht>rity, ''an objective and superficial 
change which has many physical and mental 
counterparts," and the child is not quite at 
his best, either physically or mentally, dur- 
ing this period of readjustment Compare 
this with the condition of the horse, that 
gets his second teeth at four years old. It 
is said that dealers in horses for the market 
do not care to buy at this age, since they 
find that the four-year-olds have neither the 
strength nor the endurance of the three- 
year-olds, and, in familiar speech, **are not 
trustworthy. * ' 

In the child, poverty of blood and ner- 
vousness are often associated with second 
dentition, and careful observers say that the 
child of eight fatigues more readily than one 
of six or seven, or of nine. This is ac- 
counted for by the fact that the muscular 
system is then growing rapidly, so that the 
child increases in weight, while the heart 
and vascular system do not increase corre- 
spondingly in size and strength, — hence, 
symptoms not unlike those attendant on a 
" weak heart ' * in later life, are often present, 
i. e. , shortness of breath and readiness of 
fatigue. Attendant on this condition is 
much disturbance in the functions of circu- 
lation, digestion and nutrition, frequently 
aggravated by imperfect mastication due to 
tenderness of the gums and loosening teeth. 
This is, at the same time, a period of rapid 
nervous growth and great nervous irrita- 
bility, yet in some schools, the eight-year- 
old child, in the third grade, begins the 
use of text books, has formal work in arith- 
metic and language, and in general carries 
disproportionally heavy studies. 

Middle Period. Special Charac- 
teristics 

By this time the heart muscle should have 
increased in size proportionally to the rest 
of the body; hence, fatigue is less easily 
induced than at the age of eight, and the 
child is more capable of endurance. It is

and fresh butter may be given freely, as 
much as the child cares to take, and suet 
puddings, if well made, may be used in 
moderation. A taste for olive oil should be 
cultivated, and may often be stimulated in 
girls by a few judicious and perfectly truth- 
ful remarks on its excellent effect on the 
complexion and hair. Many persons have 
grown very fond oi this excellent and whole- 
some fat by taking, to begin with, one drop 
each day, then two, $nd so on, until a tea- 
spoonful is relished, when it will be com- 
paratively easy to increase the allowance to 
an ounce, two tablespoonfuls. 

Carbohydrates. Whole wheat bread, well 
made, thoroughly baked, and properly mas- 
ticated, educator crackers, or plain toasted 
crackers, cereals, well cooked, and farina- 
ceous puddings, such as sago, tapioca, etc. ,' 
with light cake, occasionally, for variety. 
Green vegetables should be given in abun- 
dance, especially where much meat is eaten, 
to preserve the alkalinity of the blood. 
Salads of cress, lettuce, etc., with light 
dressings, fruits of all kinds, fresh or 
dried, ^ates, figs, raisins, are all good. 
Sweets in the form of jam, marmalade, 
stewed fruit, fruit sugar, milk sugar, and 
pure, crystallized cane sugar, barley sugar, 
and the caramelized sweets, such as peanut 
brittle, almond rock, and butter scotch, are 
wholesome in moderation. But sweets 
should be avoided between meals, and con- 
fectionery at all times. A child will rarely 
overeat of pure crystallized sugar, and will 
rarely use moderation with confectionery. 

Meals 

Three are not enough for a growing child. 
One or two extra lunches should be allowed, 
and, if early rising is insisted on, give a bowl 
of hot bread and milk, or a cup of cocoa 
with a roll, before the child is set any task. 



Breakfast A scientific breakfast has, 
first, some starchy food needing mastication, 
so that the alkaline secretion may stimulate 
the peptic glands to activity, and prepare 
the stomach for the digestion of the ni- 
trogenous food that follows. This should 
be fish, eggs or meat, plenty of bread and 
butter, with marmalade, or porridge with 
cream or sugar, — and, lastly, fruit, for the 
function of fruit is mainly peristaltic, and 
this needs stimulation last 

Dinner. If possible, dinner should be 
in the middle of the day; — that is, unless 
severe study is required during the after- 
noon. Soup, meat, potatoes, one green 
vegetable, and a green salad, with a simple 
sweet dish to close, ought to make an ex- 
cellent and well-balanced meal 

At four or five o'clock a light lunch of 
bread and butter or crackers, with hot 
milk, may be desirable. 

Supper. Broth with bread or crackers, 
or porridge with milk or cream, or bread 
and butter with stewed fruit or simple pre- 
serves. For variety, a light farinaceous 
pudding or milk toast, light cake, etc. , are 
useful. The evening meal should be fol- 
lowed by recreation and music, and studies 
should be tabooed. 

The dinner, where luncheon has to be 
eaten at school, should not be later than 
six, and earlier is better. Hot milk, soup 
or cocoa, should form a part of every school 
lunch, and the school should provide means 
of obtain ing them. The circulation is quick- 
ened by hot fluids. 

Avoid predigested foods, since they fur- 
nish soluble substances to the capillaries 
quicker than they can be taken up, thus 
causing clogging of these minute vessels, 
irritation of the nerves, and giving a sensa- 
tion of sufficiency before enough has really 
been eaten.

VOLUME ELEVEN 

THIS, our May issue, is the last 
number of volume eleven. With our 
June-July number we begin the 
twehth volume of the Cooking-School 
Magazin e. The volumes already published 
have come to constitute no inconsiderable 
library of culinary information. In contents 
and circulation we are conscious that we 
have made a substantial gain with each 
passing year; we want, of course, to make 
still greater gains in the years to come. 

In the last decade some progress has 
been made in the line of domestic science. 
Certainly the interest in household affairs 
has steadily increased. Besides our national 
pure food law, we have in most states a 
careful system of food inspection and analy- 
sis. We have trained nurses for the sick, 



and some trained cooks. Industrial courses, 
including cooking, have been introduced in 
many schools and colleges. The relation 
of diet to health has come to be more clearly 
understood than ever before. In the line 
of progress, thus indicated, it will be the 
aim of this magazine to render practical and 
efficient service to the housekeepers and 
home makers in our constantly increasing 
list of subscribers and readers. 



THE IDEAL EDUCATION 

A PROMINENT educator of girls, in 
addressing an audience, mostly of 
teachers, in New York, this spring, 
on "The Education of a Girl," opened 
his remarks by the question, ** Why try to 
make a man of her?" *'To educate for 
efficiency," he declared, was the use of the 
girls' school. An effident woman should 
be the product 

** There are some traits," this speaker 
insisted, **that the vast majority of people 
agree upon as being especially and desirably 
feminine: sweetness, agreeableness, or what- 
ever you are pleased to call it, grace, beauty, 
gentleness, love of home, skill in the care of 
children. Why should not those in charge 
of the education of girls attempt to formu- 
late a clear idea of what the efficient woman 
is, and then devise the best daily exercise 
they can to help each girl achieve that 
efficiency." Why not, indeed ? A school 
that could turn out that ideal girl would be 
a blessing to any community. That a 
woman, to be efficient, must resemble an 
efficient man, is the idea of many people on 
the matter. The efficient woman, efficient 
in being graceful, agreeable, gentle, home- 
loving and home-making, is more a Japanese 
educational ideal for girls, at present, than 
an American one. If to the acknowledged 
charm of the Japanese girl the superior op- 
portunities of the American girl could be 
added, what an education it would be ! 

For one does not exclude the other. 
Charm should be the heritage of every 
woman, as energy that of every man. The 
Eternal Feminine is meant to be eternally 
feminine, or she will never **lead man up-

ward and on." A school that turns out 
girls with ' ' good health, good looks, good 
brains, good ideals, and good prospects,'* 
was this wise speaker' s ideal. It is ours, 
too. — Harper^ s Bazar, 




WE have tried co-education and 
uniform education, but the ideal 
education for women, at least, is 
yet to be attaineo. In the curricula of 
our schools, science has supplanted letters, 
modem languages have taken the place of 
the classics, easy courses and athletics are 
paramount everjnvhere. Recently, it seems, 
a sort of reaction has begun, and wise ed- 
ucators are wondering if the results attained 
by our modern methods are commensurate 
in value with those of the old-time ways. 
In point of mental training, for instance, 
has any substitute been found that is quite 
equal in value to the critical study of the 
ancient classics. To the adept in language, 
the storehouses of all knowledge are open. 
In former days, time was when the condi- 
tions of life were such that many a young 
man and young woman were forced to strive 
for an education; to them a course at school 
meant something. Now the times have 
changed, and the way to an education has 
been made so easy that young people seem 
no longer to really appreciate their privileges. 
One thing, however, is certain; the phy- 
sical and mental training of boys and girls, 
should be adapted to their respective pur- 
suits in life. No amount of gainsaying can 
refute this conclusion. The highest possible 
efficiency for life's work is the goal sought 
for. When the ways and means to this end 
have come to be determined and accepted, 
then we may hope that the outlook for an 
ideal education will not be so discouraging. 
* * The gift of nearly a half-million dollars 
to Columbia University for a school of do- 
mestic science, marks a long stride in the 
perfecting of an educational institution in- 
tended to give women special training and 
broader culture. With the demands of 
social life and literary broadening, the aver- 
age American woman has fallen far short of 
the domestic accomplishments possessed 
by her grandmother."

PHYSIOLOGICAL REMEDIES SPRING'S HARBINGER 



THE most important measures which 
can be employed in dealing with the 
sick may be said to be baths, exer- 
cise, and diet. The chronic invalid can be 
made well only by being reconstructed. The 
sick man ifiust be transformed into a healthy 
man by a process of gradual change. Little 
by little the old tissues must be torn down 
and new tissues built in their place. By 
means of exercise the movement of the 
blood is accelerated and the old, diseased 
tissues are broken down and carried out of 
the body. Exercise always diminishes 
weight Warm baths increase the elimina- 
tion of waste substances, and cold baths 
stimulate the destruction of tissues, increase 
the activity of the heart and of all the tissues, 
encourage the formation of the digestive 
fluids, and increase the appetite for food; 
A dietary consisting of pure food substances, 
of a character to be easily digested and 
assimilated, is the proper material with 
which to construct a new and healthy 
body. Thus, baths, exercise, and a natural 
dietary, constitute a therapeutic trio, each 
member of which is a complement to the 
others. 

Health-getting, for the chronic invalid, is 
simply a matter of training, of health culture 
under favorable conditions, which include 
the discarding of all disease-producing 
habits, such as the use of tobacco, tea, 
coffee, and all irritating, indigestible, dis- 
ease-producing foods. — Z>. 6-. H. GazetU,

F to do were as easy as to know 
what were good to do, chapels had

that follows his own instructions; I can

temper leaps o*er a cold decree; such a

THERE is nothing sweeter than the 
song of the bluebird, for it tells of. 
cold days going and gone; it sings a 
farewell to ice and sleet and coal smoke and 
shut-up houses, and a welcome to the woods, 
the wild flowers, the tinkling brooks and the 
mild outdoors. There i% a suggestion in it 
of throwing aside the furs and overcoats, 
of sitting out on the porch, of ordering ice, 
and slicing green cucumbers. The whole 
dream of life is changed when one raises the 
window and listens to that gentle warble 
over in the next yard, intoning the breath 
of orange groves and tropical seashores, and 
making one feel that the old earth has fallen 
in love again, and it is time for everybody 
to do the same. One cannot any more 
analyze a bluebird' s song than he can the 
smile of a sweetheart. It makes one forget 
everything except to feel happy. It is hope 
and blue skies and rose bushes and joy all 
mingled into one sweet sense of satisfaction. 
— Ohio State Journal, 



THERE is no action so slight nor so 
mean but it may be done to a great

nor is any purpose so great but that slight 
acts may help it. — Ruskin,

useless, and the honest desire to help q^er 
people, will, in the quickest and most deli- 
cate way, improve yourself." 



**To establish and maintain order, har-

one's own hat, will keep one fairly well 
occupied. ' ' 



** There is nothing so good as the sun 
and the wind for driving the foolishness out 
of one." 



* ' Nothing is of any value excepting that 
which you create for yourself — no joy is 
joy save as it is the joy of self-expression."

Fresh Codfish, Broiled 
In ordering the codfish ask the dealer to 
remove the backbone. 
Heat the broiler very 
hot, oil it thoroughly, lay 
the fish upon it and let 
cook from fifteen to 
twenty minutes, the 
greater part of the time 
upon the flesh side, but 
turning several times 
and basting it with but- 
ter. When thoroughly 
cooked carefully loosen 
from the broiler and 
slide on to a hot platter; 
sprinkle with salt and spread over it a red- 
pepper butter made as follows : 

Red Pepper Butter 

Beat one- fourth acupof butter to a cream ; 
gradually beat into it the pulp from cooked 
red peppers, scraped from the skin and 
seeds, to give the color and flavor desired. 
Finish with a tablespoonful of lemon juice, 
added a few drops at a time. For the dish 
shown in the illustration, chili peppers, the 
length of the finger, were used. These come 
put up in small bottles, imported from Eng- 
land. They are of good flavor and may be 
used in preparing anchovy sandwiches or 
canapes, tomato sauce, rechauffes of meat 
or fish, or in Philadelphia relish or other 
recipes where green peppers are called for.

Waler is boiled in I

WATKR is a very important item 
in cookery. It is often made the 
vehicle of conveying heat to the 
article to be cooked, and the character of 
the cook is shown by her skill in regulating 
the degree of heat thus conveyed. 

If you put a s[xx)nful of salt or sugar into 
a glass of cold water and stir the water, the 
sugar or salt seems lost. Vou can not see 
it, but a taste of the water proves to you 
that it is there. If you use hot water in- 
stead of cold, the substance will disappear 
even more quickly. We say of these sub- 
stances that they are soluble in water. 

If a pound of steak, in one piece or in 
several small pieces, be covered with cold 
water, the water will soon be colored by the 
juices of the meat. More of the juices will 
be drawn out into the water, inagiven time, 
if the meat be cut into small pieces than if 
it be left in one large piece, just as granu- 
lated sugar will dissolve more quickly than 
a cube of loaf sugar. Water is nature's great 
solvent; all substances arc in some degree 
soluble in water. 

Water is hard or soft; hard water con- 
tains salts ot lime and is less solvent than 
sof^ water. Hard water is distinguished by 



the fact that in it soap will not lather freely. 
This solvent property of water is made much 
use of in cookery, and both in cookery and 
in nature it may be ol grtat benefit to us or 
quite the reverse; for, on account of its sol- 
vent property, water may become contam- 
inated with the germs of disease or with lead 
from the pipe in which it stands. If water 
be boiled in a teakettle, day after day, and 
the ketde be left unwashed, lime and other 
salts that settle upon the bottom of the 
kettle will become dissolved in the water, 
thus making it even more hard than when 
it is first drawn from its source. Water in 
a stationary boiler often holds in solution 
rust and other deposits from lead, copper 
and brass. None of this water is (it for 
drinking or cooking purposes. 

Safe Drinking Water 
If the presence of disease germs be sus- 
pected in water, boiling is the only remedy. 
Let the water boil vigorously half an hour, 
then pour it from a height into a vessel, 
(fruit jars are convenient), that has been 
washed in boQed water, then filled with the 
same and let stand in a hot place half an 
hour. Cover the vessel closely and store

ma cool place. Such water tastes flat and 
dead, because some of the gases in combi- 
nation have been driven off in boiling. By 
pouring the water into the receptacle from 
a height, gases are absorbed during the 
passage through the air,^Pkiich give the 
water a more natural taste. 

Joints are made in lead pipe more easily 
than in iron or steel pipe, and so the former 
is generally used in plumbing, after the pipe 
enters the walls of the house, or above the 
cellar. To obviate any danger of lead poison- 
ing, before using the water, let it run two 
or three minutes, thus discarding the water 
that has been standing in the pipe. Never 
take water from the hot- water pipe for drink- 
ing or cooking purjjoses. 

Temperature of Water for Cooking 

We have said that heat hardens proteid 
substances, and that high heat changes 
starch to soluble compounds; thus it is evi- 
dent, at once, that proteid substances and 
starch should not be subjected to water at 
the same temperature. Then, first of all, 
the young cook needs to acquaint herself 
with the nature of water at different tem- 
peratures. An ordinary thermometer, if 
handled carefully, will be of assistance in 
learning to secure accurate temperatures. 
In using the thermometer avoid subjecting 
it too suddenly to extremes of heat and 
cold. 

Boiling and Simmering Water 

Nine women out of ten will say that **a 
teakettle boils," some time before it has 
reached that state. Water holds gases and 
when heated — even by standing in a warm 
room, — these gases expand and appear as 
tiny bubbles on the bottom of the vessel; 
as the heat is increased these bubbles rise 
and break at or near the surface of the water. 
By the time most of the air has been driven 
off from the water, the heat causes larger 
bubbles to collect at the bottom of the pan; 
these bubbles are of an invisible gas known 
as steam. The first break before they reach 
the surface, because they are not strong 
enough to withstand the pressure above 
them. At this point a thermometer set in 



the water would register about 185" F. If 
the water were in a teakettle, a steady 
stream of very fine mist would slowly pass 
from the spout of the kettle. Such water 
is said to simmer. By and by, as the 
water becomes hotter, the bubbles become 
stronger and will not break until they reach 
the surface of the water; the thermometer 
(at sea level) now indicates 212° F. and 
we say the water boils. From a teakettle 
of boiling water the steam comes in forcible 
jets through the spout. Above sea level, 
the pressure being decreased, water boils 
at several degrees lower than 212" F. By 
increasing the heat water may be made to 
boil furiously, but it will not grow hotter. 

To Heat Water Quickly 

When boiling water is needed at short 
notice, set the water over the fire in a sauce- 
pan that presents considerable surface to 
the fire, and cover the dish to retain heat. 

Composition of Tea 

A cup of tea, outside of the cream and sugar 
often taken with it, possesses no nutritive 
qualities. It is a stimulant and has a mildly 
exhilarating effect. The desirable elements 
in tea are the stimulating principle, theine, 
and the essential oil, which gives fragrance. 
An undesirable element in tea is tannin, 
a bitter astringent substance. Tannin 
in the stomach interferes with digestion by 
hardening the proteid substances in the 
food; it also toughens and hardens the lin- 
ing of the stomach. The problem is to make 
tea so as to secure the desirable qualities 
and avoid the tannin. This is really a very 
simple thing to do. The essential oil and 
theine are readily and quickly dissolved 
from the tea leaves upon the application of 
boiling water. Simmering water makes a 
weak, insipid infusion of tea. After the 
water has stood on the leaves five minutes, 
the presence of the astringent tannin is ap- 
parent, and if the water with the leaves be 
boiled rather than steeped, tannin is ex- 
tracted in quantity. Tea, made by pouring 
water over the * * spent * ' tea leaves that have 
been left standing in a teapot from a pre- 
vious meal, is a slow but sure poison.

The Teapot and Tea Ball 

The pot in which tea is steeped deserves 
consideration, for tannin combines with the 
elements in some metals, as tin, producing 
most unwholesome compounds. China, 
earthen ware and silver, all are satisfactory 
wares in a teapot It doubtless is needless 
to add that both the tea and coffee-pot 
should be emptied at once after use, then 
cleansed and dried with care, and again 
scalded and dried before use. Perhaps, for 
two, a silver tea ball is quite asd esirable for 
tea making as a teapot 

Steeping the Tea 

Let the cups and tea ball be made hot 
in the warming oven, or by immersing in hot 
water and then drying. Put a generous 
teaspoonfulof tea into the ball; have fresh- 
drawn water boiling on the range or over 
the alcohol lamp. Pour the water into the 
cups and lift the ball up and down, first in 
one cup and then in the other, until the 
color shows that the right strength of tea is 
secured. Do not let the ball remain in the 
cups more than five minutes. If a stronger 
cup be desired, use the tea leaves in the 
ball for one cup, remove the spent leaves 
and take a fresh portion of leaves for the 
second cup. When tea is made in the tea- 
pot, let the pot stand in a warm place four 
or five minutes after the boiling water has 
been poured over the leaves, then pour off 
the liquid at once. As there has been no 
motion in a pot of tea that has not been 
boiled, it is quite evident that the strongest 
tea will be at the bottom of the pot 

Coffee and Coffee Making 

When the paper-like covering and the 
soft pulp are removed from the fruit of the 
coffee tree, two seeds remain; these are the 
coffee beans of commerce. By roasting 
these beans moisture is driven off and fra- 
grance is developed. By grinding or other- 
wise pulverizing the beans a larger extent 
of surface is presented to the solvent action 
of water, and, if the water be heated to the 
boiling point, a fragrant, mildly stimulating 
beverage is produced. Tannin is present 



in coffee, but in a less quantity than in tea, 
and it is not dissolved from the coffee bean 
so readily as from the more fragile tea leaf. 
Breakfast coffee may be made by boiling the 
ground coffee in the water, or by filtering 
water at the l^Rig point through the pul- 
verized product A silver or white enameled 
pot is the proper receptacle for coffee that 
is to be boiled; two level tablespoonfuls of 
ground coffee, to each cup of water, is the 
accepted proportion for the beverage. This 
proportion holds good also, if the coffee is 
to be made in a filter. For after-dinner 
coffee, double the measure of coffee is the 
rule. 

In our talk on proteid, we said that heat 
hardened proteid substances. We make use 
of this fact to secure clear, boiled coffee. 
By mixing a little white of egg (which con- 
tains a large proportion of proteid sub- 
stance) with the ground coffee, the ^;g will 
harden about the grains of coffee, when the 
liquid boils, and the mass thus held together 
will settle to the bottom of the pot, leaving 
the liquid dear and sparkling. The white 
that adheres to the shells of two eggs 
(broken for some other purpose) will be 
sufficient to clear two cups of coffee. If 
too much egg be used, such a firm coating 
will be formed around the coffee that the 
water can not act upon it and the decoction 
will be weak. 

Two Cups of Boiled Coffee 

Five level tablespoonfuls of ground coffee. 

The crushed shells of two eggs or a 
little white of egg. 

Four tablespoonfuls of cold water. 

Two and one- half cups of boiling water. 

Three tablespoonfuls of cold water. 

Mix together thoroughly the coffee, the 
crushed shells and the four tablesp>oonfuls 
of cold water; let stand five or six minutes, 
then pour on the boiling water, cover close- 
ly, and let boil three or four minutes after 
boiling begins. Remove the pot to a cooler 
part of the range, pour the three table- 
spoonfuls of water down the spout and let 
stand for about eight minutes, then care- 
fully pour off two cups of the liquid. Keep 
the inside of the coffee-pot immaculate, as

coffee absorbs odors dnd flavors most 
readily. Always scald the pot before using. 

Filtered Coffee 

A large variety of pots, in which filtered 
coffee may be made, are to be seen in 
kitchen furnishing stores. Full directions 
for making the coffee come with the pots. 
The items most essential to note are, that 
the water used be at the boiling pointy and 
the liquid be hot when it is served. A 
pound of coffee will serve two people, once 
a day, nearly two weeks.

In tea and coffee, properties of the leaf 
and bean, respectively, soluble in water, are 
all that are used in the beverage, but in 
cocoa and chocolate, both of which are 
made from cocoa seeds or beans, the beans 
themselves, fine powdered, form an integral 
part of the beverage. Then cocoa and 
chocolate become food as well as drink. 
Bromine, the stimulating principle in cocoa 
beans, is much less pronounced in its effects 
than the corresponding principle in tea or 
coffee. The high percentage of fat present 
in the bean (see composition), though some 
of this is removed in the process of manu- 
facture, together with the other food prin- 
ples, renders the beverage too rich for use 
in conjunction with hearty food. As a rule, 
in making cocoa, follow the directions pre- 
sented with the package, keeping in mind 
that, in general, boiling the mixture will im- 
prove it. In the manufacture of chocolate, 
starch is added, and thus beverages made 
from chocolate call for cooking. 

Two Cups of Chocolate 
One ounce of chocolate. 



Two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

One-half a cup of boiling water. 

One cup and one-half of hot milk (or 
part milk and part water). 

Melt the chocolate in a small saucepan 
set over the teakettle; add the sugar and 
half-cup of water, and cook and stir di- 
recdy over the fire until smooth and 
glossy; continue cooking, stirring occasion- 
ally, about six minutes, then stir into the 
milk, scalded over hot water; beat with an 
egg beater about five minutes, and the 
chocolate is ready to serve. 

Beef Tea 

The stimulating principle that we have 
noted in tea, coffee and chocolate, is dupli- 
cated in meats by a similar principle. This 
it is that gives color and flavor to the 
juices of meat This principle in meats, as 
also the albuminous juices and minor com- 
pounds, are soluble in water, and when ex- 
tracted make a valuable beverage in that it 
stimulates the appetite. Also being easily 
digested such a beverage is often desirable, 
when one is tired or indisposed. The pleas- 
ing aroma incidental to cooked meats can 
not be secured by means of cold water, but 
the albuminous juices (proteid) begin to 
harden or coagulate at about 134® F. The 
aroma is an essential aid to digestion and 
the hardening of the juices a hindrance; 
thus the temperature of the water should 
be regulated to fit both requirements, that 
is, the preservation of juices and flavor. 

Recipe for Beef Tea. 

« 

One pound of beefsteak from the round, 
two cups of cold water, salt to season. 

Remove fat from the meat, wipe the 
steak with a damp cloth, then cut into small 
pieces. Have ready a fruit jar, scalded and 
cooled; put in the meat and two cups of 
cold water, cover the jar and let it stand 
twenty minutes in a cool place. Fold a 
newspaper to make a thick, smooth jnat; put 
this into a saucepan, set the jar upon it and 
pour in cold water to surround the jar to 
the height of the liquid inside. Let the 
water heat gradually to i3o**F. Keep it at 
this point for two hours, then increase the

temperature to about 134** F., or until the 
color of the juice is darkened a little and 
the albuminous juices are slightly coagu- 
lated. Pour off the li(iuid, season and serve. 
A sprig or two of parsley, or a stalk of celery 
cut in pieces, may be put into the jar with 
the meat.

The Way Back Home

And told him to **be good,** 
And ** change*' at Sunny town, **bc sure I*' 

And so he said he would. 



The brakemen came and talked with him; 

He felt quite tall and grand — 
P'or he was traveling alone, 

Of course you understand. 

And when they came to Silnnytown, 

You may believe, he knew

Just what his mother* d do. 

He held his ticket, tight and fast. 
He stood up, brave and straight,

He saw a big conductor man 

With buttons on his coat, 
And in his cosxing little voice 

There came an anxious note —

About Milk 

AT the miJk conference held in New 
York city in the early winter, the as- 
sociation discussed the milk problem, and 
byvote reached certain conclusions: "Asa 
food pure milk is invaluable; as a carrier 
of disease germs impure milk is a fearful 
menace. Particularly for babies, milk b 
both indispensable and dangerous." 

*' There are two ways by which milk may 
be freed from disease germs; one is by keep- 
ing the germs out, the other is by killing 
them after they are in. Neither way is ab- 
solutely infallible. ' ' 

The method of Pasteurization treats milk 
so as to kill any germs that may be present. 
Pasteurization consists in raising the tem- 
perature of milk to about 155° 'o 170°. and 
io keeping it there a short time, then in 
rapidly cooling and keeping it cold until 
needed. Pasteurized milk is not intended for 
long keeping; it will keep sweet longer than 
raw milk, but should be freshly prepared for 
daily use. For those who have no Pasteurizing 
apparatus and are not within reach of dis- 
tributing centers, I will describe the method 
we have followed, for nearly a year, and 
with most satisfactory results. 

As soon as the milk is received, it is 
placed in a granite or porcelain- lined pan, 
covered, and set, in a kettle of cold water, 
right over the fire. When the water begins 
to show heat, slip the cover to one side, and 
test with a dairy thermometer, watching 
until the temperature rises to 150° or 155°. 
When that point is reached, remove the 
milk from the fire, still in the water bath, 
and cover the whole with a thick cloth and 
leave from ten to thirty minutes. After 
which place the milk vessel in a bath of cold 



water, and change the water often until the 
milk is chilled; then keep in a cool place 
until needed. This milk keeps well twenty- 
four hours, in an ordinary pantry, even in 
hot suQuner days, though of course it is 
much better if one has a cool place for it 
Milk treated in this way, unless it be raised 
to too high a temperature, has not the taste 
of scalded milk so objectionable to many. 
By raising the temperature to 150° the 
souring germs are destroyed; by raising it to 
170" any disease germs likely to be present 
are destroyed. Mothers with bottle-fed 
babies are recommended to secure a Pas- 
teurizing apparatus, and use only Pasteur- 
ized milK for the baby. 

Directions for Pasteurizing milk with a 
description of the apparatus can be found 
in Bulletin No, 42, "Facts About Milk," 
issued by the U, S. Dept of Agriculture, 
Washington, D, C. It is mailed to any 
one on application.

A Wholesome Gruel 

THE following recipe was given by 
a successful physician. He evolved 
it himself, and gives it when other food can- 
not be assimilated. In cases of indigestion, 
he sometimes recommends it at night to the 
exclusion of other foods, the two earlier 
meals being unaltered, save by the exercise 
of ordinary caution in the avoidance of in- 
digestible foods. 

Take two level tablespoon&ls of corn- 
starch and one level tablespoonful of flour; 
mix together and wet with cold water; stir 
while pouring on two cups of boiling water, 
and let boil fixim fifteen to twenty minutes; 
take off the fire and add one cup of milk

without much cream in it, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt (less if preferred) and a little 
soda. 

If this gruel be again brought to a boiling 
point, it becomes an excellent food for a 
patient suffering from diarrhoea.

Bag on Clothes Basket 

OH, dear ! I foi^ot to bring upstairs 
that button * which came off of sis- 
ter's waist in the wash." 

After having to go down stairs four differ- 
ent times on such an errand, I fastened 
a little bag to the handle of the clothes 
basket, and into this all stray buttons are 
dropped and carried upstairs with the clean 
clothes; they are then ready to be sewed 
on as the clothes are mended.

WHEN obliged to walk against a pierc- 
ing cold wind for a considerable dis- 
tance there is no protection quite so good 
as a silk handkerchief over that portion of 
the face most exposed, and I always use 
one in* preference to, or in addition to, a 
veil, in protecting a child' s face. 

When there are new kitchen spoons to 
buy, be sure to ask for the kind having a 
hook half way up the back of the handle. 
These cost only a trifle more than the plain 
ones, and this is entirely offset by the an- 
noyance that is done away with of having 
them slip into the pan. The hook holds 
the handle far enough above the pan to 
keep it cool, and it is useful, also, as a 
finger piece to prevent the spoon from turn- 
ing when beating or stirring stiff mixtures. 

I picked up a useful bit of information 
from the plumbers who were doing some 
repair work in our home. A screw that 
seemed immovable had a red hot poker ap- 
plied to its head for a few moments. After 
the screw had expanded with the heat, and 
then cooled a little, it was loosened enough 
to be easily taken out. 

The admonitions that are occasionally 
given through the pages of magazines to 



carefulness in the use of ^ighted'candles are 
well grounded. I have known at least two 
narrowly averted catastrophies caused by 
passing through portieres with a lighted 
candle. But, happily, those who will can 
now reduce danger to a minimum by pro> 
curing candlesticks fitted with glass chim- 
neys, for candles used ** in transit" The 
only variation from the ordinary candlestick 
is the addition of springs, similar to those 
of the ordinary lamp burner, which hold a 
straight lamp chimney in place after the 
candle is lighted. In addition to greater 
safety as a hand light, the flame is steadier 
and the light consequently better.

Non-Poisonous Fly Paper 

In the home where there are little chil- 
dren or pet animals poisonous fly paper 
should never be used, and the sticky kind 
leads to many unpleasant accidents. An 
excellent substitute for either is made by 
mixing a quantity of ground pepper with 
twice its amount of brown sugar, and add- 
ing enough condensed milk to make a 
smooth paste. Spread on paper and place 
where flies are numerous. They die almost 
immediately after eating it 

For Silver 

While visiting a fi-iend recently, I com- 
mented upon the beauty of her silver, and 
asked her how she took such excellent care 
of so large a quantity. I had noticed that, 
with a very few exceptions, it was kept in 
a comer closet with glass doors, instead of 
being strewn about on the sideboard and 
serving table in the usual way. Going to 
the cupboard she said, * * You see this closet 
is made as tight as possible, to protect the 
silver from the air, which contains gasses 
that tarnish it. Then I place about on the 
shelves pieces of camphor gum, and keep 
the doors jealously closed. I am saved 
hours of tedious scouring every month, for 
my silver seldom needs a thorough cleaning. 
I inherited both the closet and the idea 
from my grandmother, who was a famous 
housekeeper in her day." Since then I

have tried the plan to my infinite saisfac- 
tion, and I wish every housewife, who is 
burdened with a quantity of silver, would 
give it a trial. 

Individual Towels 

When all the members of a family are 
obliged to use one bathroom, a great num- 
ber of towels are needlessly soiled, as they 
will become mixed, and each person is, 
therefore, inclined to take a fresh one every 
thne he washes his hands or face. 

To remedy this I selected a dozen towels 
for each person in the house, and with white 
embroidery floss worked the owner's initials 
on each one in large plain script. It gives 
a dainty and individual touch beside adding 
length to the life of the linen by reducing 
the needless laundering. If one does not 
object to colors, it is a pretty idea to have 
each person's towels with a special colored 
border, in which case it is not necessary to 
embroider them. Small letters, such as can 
be purchased for marking purposes, may be 
used and, though not so dainty, are easy to 
apply and answer every purpose, saving 
much labor and expense. 

Alarm Clock in Kitchen 

One of the greatest time savers in my 
kitchen is an alarm clock — one with an in- 
termittent strike furnished with a little lever 
so that it may be stopped at wiD. This is 
a great improvement over the old kind that 
must run down before stopping, as it may 
be used many times during the day without 
being wound, if stopped at once each time; 
and the alarm, being of longer duration, is 
more apt to claim attention if one happens 
to be some distance away. If I have a few 
minutes to spare before getting dinner, I set 
the alarm, and may then go into the garden 
or distant parts of the house without a 
thought of worry, for I am certain of being 
called at precisely the right moment; in this 
way I accomplish many odd tasks that I 
could not otherwise undertake, and all with- 
out causing an extra step to look at the 
clock. 

After putting anything in the oven I set 
the alarm at the time I think it will need 



looking after, and may then give my un- 
divided attention to the work I have in 
hand, thereby accomplishing much more 
with less fatigue than of old; for it is the 
worry of many duties, claiming attention at 
the same time, that wearies the busy house- 
wife. 

Many a much needed nap is gained, when 
I find fifteen or twenty minutes to sp&re, by 
placing the little clock on a pillow beside 
me — the pillow softens the shrill noise to 
a low whirr, which, nevertheless, awakens 
me, and I can stop the alarm without get- 
ting up, which is much better than springing 
suddenly up at the moment of awakening. 

No one can realize how much thought 
and how many steps a clock like this can 
save; when once it has started there is no 
such thing as ignoring it, as it takes nearly 
half an hour to run down, which certainly 
makes it a very persistent reminder.

medicinal wine, while the tonic properties 
of the root are well known. 

Among other wayside friends may be 
mentioned the dock, thistle, shepherd's 
purse, pepper grass, pigweed, wild mus- 
tard, plantain, and the young shoots of 
milkweed. All these make wholesome 
greens when cooked like the dandelion. 

Sorrel makes an especially nice salad, 
served with plain French dressing; also a 
soup that is both unusual and good can be 
made of it. 

Sorrel Soup — Pick over a quart of sor- 
rel, removing hard stems, and wash. Melt 
a (juarter a cup of butter in a saucepan 
and cook the sorrel in it until colorless. 
Strain through a sieve. Put three pints 
of stock or water in a soup kettle, with 
one pint of thick, white sauce and add 
the sorrel. Season with sugar, salt and 
nutmeg. Let boil fifteen minutes, then 
move to one side and add the beaten yolks 
of two eggs and one cup of thin cream. 
Heat, but do not let boil, five minutes. 
Serve with a garnish of croutons or hard- 
cooked eggs. 

Another spring dish dear to our Yankee 
forefathers, was tansy fritters. Those who 
still have recollections, not fond by any 
means, of bitter doses of tansy tea admin- 
istered in childhood as a vermifuge, can 
not fail to be surprised and pleased, if they 
will but try this old, old recipe for tansy 
fritters. Chop enough young tansy leaves 
to fill half a cup. Sift two cups of flour 
with one tcaspoonful of baking powder and 
half a teaspoonful of salt. Beat two eggs 
well and add a cup of milk. Pour the 
liquid into the flour, beating smooth. Add 
the tansy, mix well and drop by tablespoon- 
fuls into hot fat. Cook a delicate brown. 
Drain on paper and serve hot with the old- 
time sauce of molasses and vinegar — two 
parts of molasses to one of vinegar — or a 
wine sauce if preferred. The tansy gives 
the fritters a most delicious and aromatic 
flavor. 

Nature is bountiful and, if one only has 
the eyes to see the good, and the patience 
to gather from the store of ** weeds * * she so 
plenteously scatters around, many a dainty 



dish or crisp salad can be obtained without 
money and without price.** H. S.

floorS) she kneels on a little, cotton-stufled 
cushion, moving it from place to place as 
required. Other items which she finds 
helpful may be new to others, such as sub- 
stituting one pair of shoes for another, after 
completing the washing; standing on a soft 
rug ])laced on the cement floor while wash- 
ing and ironing; sprinkling the clothes with 
hot water and a clean whisk broonL In 
cold weather, handkerchiefs and small arti- 
cles are attached to a short clothes-line in 
the laundry, and the line is hung out of 
doors. When the clothes are dry, the line 
is brought in, and the little articles are 
removed at will. At the completion of 
ironing, each iron receives a thin coating 
of beeswax, which prevents rusting. A 
similar preventive of rust in the boiler is to 
rub the inside with kerosene. 

When baked potatoes are to be served, 
before putting them into the oven rub them 
with butter or lard. When done, the skins 
will be thin and tender. Prick eacli 
potato with a fork, before baking. It will 
make them more mealy and less apt to be 

soggy. I. E. G.

Advantages of Toast 

DID you ever wonder why toast is 
always reconmiended for invalids ? ' * 
said a chemist ''The reason is that toast 
is predigested bread." 

* * What makes firesh bread trying for in- 
valids is the starch in it Starch is very 
hard to digest It needs a good stomach 
to take hold of the soggy starch in bread 
and change it to strengthening, stimulating 
dextrine. 

*' But when you cut bread thin and toast 
it brown, the fire itself changes the starch 
to dextrine. That, in fact, is what the 
brown color in toast indicates — that the 
starch is gone and dextrine has taken its 
place. * '

Query 1240. — Mrs. J. H., Binningham, Ala- 
bama* 1 ** How may fresh Mushrooms be kept from 
tunung dark while cooking ? " 

To Prevent Discoloring of Mush- 
rooms 

As fast as the. mushrooms are peeled or 
made ready for cooking, sprinkle them thor- 
oughly with lemon juice, or they may be 
rolled around in the j uice. As lemon j uice 
conceals somewhat the true mushroom 
flavor, most lovers of mushrooms prefer the 
discolored appearance to the loss of flavor.

consist of pieces of one or several varieties 
of fruit, cooked or fresh, mixed with sugar, 
or sugar syrup, and the juice of the fruit 
Wine may or may not be added. The whole 
is chilled and served in glass sherbet cups, 
champagne glasses, in a pineapple-shell or 
in the peel of oranges, or grape fruit pre- 
pared for the purpose.

chilled, then serve in the cups set on a 
doily-covered plate. 



Query 1243.— Miss M. H., Redlands,Califorma. 
" Recipes for Chicken Timbales, Swedish Timbale 
Cases, and Cornucopias for Serving Ice Cream." 

Chicken Timbales 

Pass the breasts of two uncooked chickens 
through a meat chopper; add one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a dash of white pepper and a 
grating of nutmeg, then beat into the mix- 
ture, one at a time, the unbeaten whites of 
three eggs, and then very gradually beat in 
one pint of cream. Cook the mixture in 
small, well-buttered timbale moulds. The 
moulds should stand on many folds of paper 
and be surrounded by boiling water. When 
the mixture is firm in the center, it is cooked. 
Serve turned from the moulds and sur- 
rounded by white or Bechamel sauce. 

Chicken Timbales No. 2 

Use the recipe for Chicken Timbale en 
Surprise, given on page 188, of the Novem- 
ber, 1906, number. The veal and chicken 
together should weigh half a pound. The 
surprise part. (sweetbreads, etc) may be 
used or omitted. 



QUERIES AND ANSWERS 



497 



Swedish Timbale Cases 

Sift together three-fourths a cup of flour 
and half a teaspoonful of salt; beat the yolks 
of two eggs, add half a cup of milk, and 
very gradually stir the egg and milk into the 
dry ingredients. Beat thoroughly and set 
aside in a cool place for an hour or longer. 
The cases when fried should be delicate, 
thin and crisp. If they are thick and soft, 
add more milk, a few drops at a time. 

Cornucopias for Serving Ice 

Cream 

Bake sponge cake mixture on saucers or 
small round tins. When baked the cakes 
should be of the thickness of ladyfingers. 
The instant the cakes are baked, remove 
them from the baking dish; lay them upside 
down on a piece of cloth or oiled paper and 
roll to a point at one end, in cornucopia 
shape. Almond wafer-mixture baked on 
inverted pans may be rolled in the same 
shape and used for the same purpose; the 
wafers are, however, very fragile, and thus 
not as practicable as the sponge cake. 
Gauffres are well adapted for this use (see 
Dea No., 1906); but not every one has a 
gauffre iron. 



Query 1244.— Mrs. G. H. C, New Glasgow, 
N. S. ** Recipe for Sultana Cake such as one can 
buy at a first-class bakery. In the recipe for Nut 
Layer Cake, repeated in the March number, is the 
layer in which the nuts are pressed to be used 
without frosting for the top of the cake ? " 

Sultana Cake 

We can rarely duplicate cakes sold by 
bakers or at exchanges. The following cake 
is very satisfactory. Beat half a cup of 
butter to a cream; gradually beat in one cup 
of granulated sugar, then the unbeaten yolks 
of three eggs and, alternately, half a cup of 
milk and one cup and three-fourths of sifted 
flour, sifted again with four level teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder and half a teaspoonful 
of mace. Beat in half a cup of sultana raisins, 
dredged and mixed with three teaspoonfuls 
of flour, and the whites of three eggs, beaten 
dry. Bake in a loaf about forty-five minutes. 



Referring to Nut Layer Cake 
Given in March Number 

The layer into which nuts are pressed, 
etc , is used as the top layer of the cake and 
without frosting. 



Query 1245. — Mrs. F. J. H., Brookline, Mass. 
** Best method of Salting Almonds." 

Salted Almonds 

Cover the almonds with lukewamf water, 
and heat quickly to the boiling point; drain 
and cover with cold water, then press each 
nut, one by one, between the thumb and 
finger, to slip off the skin, now dry the nuts 
on a cloth. Dip the tips of the fingers of 
the right hand into unbeaten white of egg, 
and repeatedly take up and drop a few nuts, 
until they are well coated with the egg. 
Continue until all the nuts are coated with 
6ggi th^n dredge them with salt, mix 
thoroughly and let brown delicately in the 
oven. 



Query 1246. — Mrs. D. A. S., San Jos6, Cali-

reduce by boiling and let cool before using. 
Beat one pint of heavy cream and half a 
cup of maple syrup until firm to the bottom 
of the bowl Turn into a chilled mould lined 
with paper, filling the mould to overflow;

Qtery 1247. — Mrs. W. J. H., Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. " Recipe for Chicken Mousse.^* 

Chicken Mousse 

Scald one cup of milk, cream or well-re- 
duced chicken broth; beat the yolks of three 
eggs slightly; add one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of salt and a dash of paprika and cook in 
the hot liquid until ,the mixture coats the 
spoon. Remove from the fire and add one- 
fourth a package of gelatine, softened in 
one-fourth a cup of cold water or chicken 
broth. Strain the preparation over half a 
cup of cooked, chicken breast, chopped, 
pounded in a mortar and sifted. Stir over 
ice water, until the mixture begins to set, 
then fold into it one cup of whipped cream. 
Turn into small timbale moulds, or into a 
large mould lined with paper. The moulds 
may be decorated with pistachio nuts or 
trufHes, or both may be used. Serve when 
chilled and firm with lettuce or other green 
salad. This is particularly good with lettuce 
and tomatoes. French or mayonnaise dress- 
ing may be used. 



Query 1248. — Mrs. C. H. J., South Bethlehem, 
Pa. " Kindly give directions for Baking Bread itn 
a gas range. That which I bake is apt to be a 
little slack-baked.'* 

Baking Bread in Gas Range 

We are to take up this subject later on, 
but points on baking will bear frequent 
repetition. When the loaves of bread have 
been nearly doubled in bulk, they are ready 
for the oven. Let them remain in the oven 
about fifty minutes. Divide the time into 
quarters. At the end of twelve minutes 
die bread should have risen still more, 
and should be seared or crusted over and 
browned a little in spots. The conunon 
mistake in baking bread in a gas oven is 
overheat during the first fifteen minutes. 
In too hot an oven at the start, a thick 



brown crust is formed, which keeps the 
heat from penetrating to the center of the 
loaf. Such bread seems baked and is often 
taken from the oven in thirty minutes, but 
it is not baked through. If left in longer 
than thirty minutes, the heat is often lowered 
too much — the color being dark enough 
— and the center is not well baked. The 
heat should be at maximum just before 
the bread has been in the oven half an hour 
and should diminish, thereafter, gradually. 



Query 1249.— B. L. S., Tiskilwa, lU, "How 
and when is Bar-le-duc served with Cheese.^ 
How is it arranged on a plate and with what is it 
served ? " 

Service of Cheese and Bar-le-duc 

Currants 

Cream cheese and bar-le-duc currants 
may take the place of the dessert course 
and be followed by coffee. Or, they may 
take the place of the game course and be fol- 
lowed by hot and cold dessert dishes, bon- 
bons and coffee. The cheese and currants 
may be disposed on individual dishes — as 
described and illustrated on page 480 of this 
number of the magazine. Or, the cheese, 
cut in small cubes and disposed on a small 
plate over which a lace paper doily has 
been laid, may be passed on a tray with the 
currants in the original glass set on a plate, 
that each may help himsel£ If preferred, 
the currants may be turned into a small cut- 
glass dish. A si>oon is needed with the 
currants. Another method of serving the 
cheese and currants was illustrated on pages 
311 and 315 of the January, 1905, number, 
Water crackers, wafers, pulled bread (hot), 
toasted muffins (English), browned crack- 
ers, toasted cassava bread, or Svea wafers 
are all suitable to serve with the cheese 
and currants.

Serving of Canned Mushrooms 

The small button mushrooms that come 
.to us in cans have been cooked, and, like all 
proteid substances, are toughened by further 
cooking. They are used principally in 
sauces, and should be added to the hot 
sauce a few minutes before it is to be 
served. The mushrooms may be left whole 
or cut into quarters. They are also (cut 
into quarters) added to a dish of creamed 
fish, oysters or chicken, or to a similar dish 
made witha brown sauce. Added to a brow»^ 
tomato or Spanish sauce the whole is poureo 
over a broiled steak or a roast fillet of beef. 
In larger quantity they may be served in a 
brown or a cream sauce on toast 

Rhubarb Wine 

Cut in bits and crush five pounds of 
rhubarb; add the thin yellow rind of a 
lemon and one gallon of water and let stand 
covered two days; strain off the liquid and 
add four pounds of sugar; put this into a 
small cask with the bung hole covered with 
muslin, and let it work two or three days, 
then put in the bung and let stand four 
months, when it is ready to draw off and 
bottle. This is said to resemble champagne 
in looks and flavor, but, not having tried 
the recipe, we do not vouch for it 

Spiced Tea 

Allow two or three cloves for each spoon- 
ful of tea, steeping the cloves with the tea; 
when cold add the juice of a lemon and two 
lumps of sugar to each pint of tea infusion, 
mix thoroughly and serve very cold. Chill 
by contact with ice rather than by putting 
< ice into the liquid. 

Fruit Punch 

: : Crush two quarts of strawberries (hulled, 

» ^washed and drained), with two cups of 

. sugar; let them stand an hour or more, then 

press through a finepur^e sieve or a cheese 

•cloth. Grate a pineapple and press out all 

' the juice; add the juice of six oranges and 

' four lemons; mix the fruit juice with a cup 

' of fresh -made tea, chilled for the purpose, 

then add cold water and sugar as needed. 



The beverage should not be very sweet, but 
it should be strongly flavored with fruit 
juice. ChiU in fruit jars before serving. 

Plain Aspic Jelly 

Beat together thoroughly a quart of 
strong chicken broth, two slices of onion, 
half a carrot sliced, a sprig of parsley, a tea> 
spoonful of celery seed, a piece of pepper 
pod, a two-ounce package of gelatine 
softened in a cup of cold water, salt as 



Appendicitis 

Not at til! Necessary to Operate in Many Cases 

Automobiles and Appendicitis scare 
some people before they are hit. 

Appendicitis is often caused by too 
much starch in the bowels. Starch is hard 
to digest and dogs up the digestive ma- 
chinery — also tends to form cakes in the 
caecum. (That's the blind pouch at en- 
trance to the {^)pendix). 

A N. H. girl had appendicitis, but lived 
on milk for a while — then Grape-Nuts 
and got well without an operation. 

She says : **Five years ago, while at 
school, I suffered terribly with constipation 
and indigestion." (Too much starch, 
white bread, potatoes, etc., which she did 
not digest). 

"Soon after I left school I had an at- 
tack of appendicitis and for thirteen weeks 
lived on milk and water. When I recov- 
ered enough to eat solid food there was 
nothing that would agree with me, untia 1 
friend recommended Grape- Nuts. 

**When I began to eat Grape-Nuts, I 
weighed 98 lbs. , but I soon grew to 1 1 5 lbs. 
The distress after eating left me entirely 
and now I am like a new person." 

(A little Grape- Nuts dissolved in hot 
water or milk' would have been much 
better for this case than milk alone, for the 
starchy part of the wheat and barley is 
changed into a form of digestible sugar in 
making Grape- Nuts). Name given by

Serving Food in Ramequins 

A tiny, hot ramequin is not an easy dish

* Invete^te Tea Drinker Feared Paralysis 

Steady use of either tea or coffee often 
produces alarming symptoms as the ]>oisoD 
(caffeine) contained in these beverages 
acts with more potency in some persons 
than in others. 

**I was never a coffee drinker," wTite= 
an 111. woman, " but a tea drinker. I was 
very nervous, had frequent spells of sick 
headache and heart trouble, and was sub- 
ject at times to severe attacks of bilious 
colic. 

* * No end* of sleepless nights — would 
have spells at night when my right side 
would get ntimb and tingle like a thousand 
needles were pricking my flesh. At times 
I could hardly put my tongue out of my 
mouth and my right eye and ear were ef- 
fected. 

The doctors told me I was liable to be- 
come paralyzed at any time, so I was in 
constant dread. I took medicine of vari- 
ous doctors and no end of patent mcdi 
cine — all to no good. 

** The doctors told me to quit using tea. 
but I thought I could not live without it — 
that it was my only stay. I had been a 
tea drinker for twenty-five years ; was un-

gives nine hundred ways of using them. 

A great many (leople are in doubt about 
the /itness of meat for food; but that fruit 
is a natural food product no one can ques- 
tion. The sentiment of intelligent peojile 
tod.iy towards the subject of a meat diet 
may be expressed thus: " Eat more fruit 
and Xms meat and let the {)ackers and doc- 
tors louk out for themselves. The doctor 
has little to do with fruit-caters. . We did 
notsa^^at no meat, but eat less meat" 
"^c eating of less meat certainly means 
the eating of more fruit and grains and 
vegetables. The <|uestion is does a dief 
tend to brutalize or lead in the opposite 
direction: We are not certain but that the 
meat-eater feels a bit guilty; but surely the 
so-called vegetarian has a clean conscience. 
It is useless to deny that sentiment as well 
as health is closely connected with our 
habits of eating. We may eat to refine- 
ilk' t or the reverse. 

Id this volume the value of fruit and 
fruit juice is made plain: alsb the ways of 
using both the common and the uncom- 
mon kinds of fruit are clearly defined. It 
is the most considerable book that has 
been written on the subject 



Cereal Co., of BaKle Creek, Mich. The, 
booklet is not only descnptivfc of the mar- 
velous growth of a great enlcriirise, but it 
also makes plain the intrinsii; merits of the 
products put upon the market by this com- . 
pany. Its pprusal is both, instructiye and 
convincing. In the choice of a diet, the 
need ofintelligence is no longer ijuestioned. 
In estimating food values, the why and 
the wherefore must be considered. From 
this view point, this booklet is especially 
instructive.

The Talk of the Town 

The agitation against the House of Lords 
recalls a characteristic anecdote of Presi- 
dent Lincoln. During the critical time 
in the civil war, when the senate had 
been particularly obstructive, one of Presi- 
dent Lincoln'sardent sympathisers burst in 
upon him and hotly denounced the senate, 
and finished his tirade by asking: " What's 
the use of the senate, anyway?" Mr. 
Lincoln was drinking a cup of tea, In^his 
homely fashion he poured the tea from the 
cup to the saucer and back agiun to cool it 
off, undisturbed by the caller^s vehemence. 
"Well," said the man, impadently, 
"what's the use of the senate?" "Ihave 
just shown you," was Lincoln's answer, 
and once more the tea was poured. The: 
man looked puzzled. , Then a great light', 
broke upon him. " Yotr mean it enables - 
public passion tQ cool off? * ' The greatest 
of American presidents nodded and drank 
his tea." — Exchange.

Asparagus 

( ContlMded from pagt ^t) 

are also complicated sauces, which have 
their merits, but they must be soft and vel- 
vety and mtist not detract from the delicate 
flavor of the asparagus itself. 

FicaUy, it is a mooted question as to the 
correctmannerof consuming the vegetable. 
Most frequently the stalks are cut with the 
knife and carried to the mouth with the 
fork, but the flowing juices are thereby k>sL 
It is really preferable to take the end of the 
stalk in one's fingers and af^er dipping the 
tip into the sauce, to bite it off. However, 
Dot every one can do this with grace and 
elegance. He who would retain the respect 
and good wiU of his neighbor, should avoid 
doing as one man did, when the dish with 
asparagus was passed to him at table; he 
simply sliced ofT the tips and helped him- 
self to these only. On the remonstrance 
of bb neighbor at this singular proceeding, 
he harmlessly replied: " Eh — man, don't 
you know, that is just the best part t " 



The women's suffrage movement has 
without doubt, been greatly assisted by the 
measures taken by the authorities to re- 
press it Many persons had up to a point 
regarded the demonstrations as a joke, but 
when it came to an orderly procession of 
women being ridden down by mounted 
police, and trampled under their horses' 
hoofe, the situation, which might seem 
humorous in St Petersburg or Warsaw, 
became too grave for Englishmen to laugh 
at Many extravagances of feminine agita- 
tors were condoned and foi^tten in the 
sympathy excited by that exhibition of 
oflicial violence. 

A correspondent of an orthodox contem- 
porary, who anxiously inquires if a minister 
who docs not believe in a persona] devil has 
any right to be a pastor of a Baptist church, 
is informed, " We doubt if any one really 
believes in a ])ersonal devil except through 
personal experience with him, but there are 
churches whose pastors have had experi- 
ence enough to conflrra such belief." —

Adulteration in Spices 

The old-fashioned adulterants such as 
worin-eiilen, hard bri-:id. nut shells, etc, 
are not so fre<]uently uaed in spices as fur- 
merly ; modern methods seem to demand 
that all spices shall lie marked "pure" 
and the unprincipled spice-grinders buy up 
the otherwise worthless refuse of ginger-ale 
factories and essential-oil distilleries to mix 
with their spices. 

Murh of the so-called "-pure" ginger 
, aintaiiis a liberal pro]X)rtiiin uf this fx- 
-h.iu^ed ginger from wliich all the flavor hus 
been extracted, "and the same thing is true 
in regard to other s[rices, cloves, allspicf, 
nutmeg, mace, etc,; all -have their corre- 
sponding exhausted product, from sthidi 
all the goodness has been distilled to make 
essential oils for meiJicinal.and manuiactur- 
ing purjioses. 

It is not cnOugh-f*'!- *^'^ housekee^r iu 
ask for "pure spices." for all ground spices 
are called "pure;" the only protection 
she can have is to insist U[K>n havmg her 
spices in sealed packages bearing the brand 
of some reliable spice-grinder s^ch as 
"Sladc's," which she knows to b^ abso- 
lutely pure and reliable. 

Such spices, even though she pays more 
for them, are more economical, because 
they go so much farther and i)rodiice so 
much better results. Adtiherated stuff is 
dear at any price and often unwholesome. 



Not Fair — .\ little boy was fishing, and 
rawin^j in his line, found that the Itait had 
et-n taken off without result, whereupon he 
ur-it into tears and said, " It's cheating; !"

Washing tlie Face 
Use a soft doth and mop the face in it 
without ringing the doth. Dip the doth 
into the water, and rub on it some Ivory 
Soap. This is one of the best complexion 
soaps, because it is pure, contains do alkali, 
and the oil in the soap is excellent for the 
skin. Use plenty ofsoap, because it b the 
only way to get the skin clean. Do not be 
afraid of hot water and soap, if you want a 
good complexion. Souse the skin well for 
almost or quite five minutes. Then rinse 
with cold water. 

The advantage of using hot water is that 
it opens the pores, allowing dust and dirt 
to make their way ouL Cold water doses 
them and stiffens the skin. — " A»uruaM

Your laundress may be a "jewel." Lei us hope she is. 

Nevertheless, there are some things that you may not care 
to entrust even to her— lace handkerchiefs, for example, colored 
goods, or, possibly, a shirt-waist of more than ordinary beauty. 

Such articles as these you will do well to wash yourselL 

There is no trouble about it. All you need is a cake of Ivory 
Soap and a bowl of lukewarm water. 

Care in ironing is, of course, essential. But the main thing 
is to cleanse—thoroughly, with reasonable quickness and with- 
out risk. 

For that purpose, nothing is so good as Ivory Soap. 

It is pure, mild, contains no "free" alkali and can be used 
with entire satisfaction for hundreds of purposes for which 
ordinary soaps are unsafe and unsatisfactory.
