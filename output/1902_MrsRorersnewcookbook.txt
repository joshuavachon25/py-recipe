PILEFACE 



A^^^|N active teacher and a constant student must in 
^^.^^^^ twenty years collect and accumulate a vast 
l^^^i amount of knowledge ; in fact, too much to be 
embodied in a single book. 

I have no apology to offer for the appearance of a 
new book on Domestic Science, especially this one. It 
represents on paper The School at its period of highest 
development, and the results of hard work of the best 
years of my life. Please read carefully each chapter of 
instructions preceding the recipes, for herein lies the great 
value of the work. I have not compiled a recipe book, 
but have made a complete new book telling the things 
one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and the 
easiest and best way of housekeeping. It is a book of 
general household knowledge. 

A great change in the methods of living has taken 
place in America during the last few years. There was 
a time in the memory of teachers yet quite young when 
schools of cookery were places where persons were taught 
to make all sorts of fancy, odd and occasionally used 
dishes. In fact, to succeed with these elaborate dys- 
peptic-producing concoctions was the highest ambition. 

All this has now changed : the teacher or cook book

4 PREFACE 

(an ever present teacher) that does not teach health, body 
building, and economy in time and money, is short 
lived. There are still a few women who do elaborate 
cooking to please the palate and appetite, and the general 
habits of people. They are still in the palate stage of 
existence. Strive to reach a higher plane of thought — 
eat to live. Why should any woman be asked to stand 
for hours over a hot fire mixing compounds to make 
people ill^ Is this cookery? Is the headache that 
follows a food debauchery more pleasant or pardon- 
able or less injurious than that which follows drink ? 
Results of intemperance are identical. Simple living 
and high thinking have the approval of learned men and 
women, but, like all temperance questions, depend so 
much upon habit, education and palate that progress 
must be slow ; but there is no better stimulant to the 
enthusiastic worker than slow progression — the constant 
but regular improvement. 

It has been fifteen years since I published my first 
book ; during this time I have seen the art progress from 
" fancy cookery " to the highest type of Domestic Sci- 
ence. It has found a permanent place in the curriculum 
of our public schools, where it has been most valuable 
as a means of mental and moral training as well as useful 
for the individual in home keeping or obtaining a liveli- 
hood, all of which tend to and aid in the development 



PREFACE 



of industries. To fit students for living should be the 
main object of public education. 

I believe that every woman should know how to 
housekeep. Giving up entirely the moral influence of 
a good meal, I believe that all women should learn to 
cook as an aid to higher education. Cookery puts into 
practice chemistry, biology, physiology, arithmetic, and 
establishes an artistic taste. And if our motto is, " Let 
us live well, simply, economically, healthfully and artisti- 
cally," we have embraced all the arts and sciences.

CHEMISTRY OF FOOD 

Of all the changes brought about during the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury, few have had a greater influence for good than the 
progress made in scientific cookery. A proper understand- 
ing of the conditions under which we live is of vital impor- 
tance and assistance to the housewife and mother. Domestic 
science, including chemistry of food, is now taught in nearly 
all the public schools of our large cities. The young child 
is able to tell not only the chemistry of common foods, but 
the effect of heat upon them. These girls when they reach 
womanhood will be able to select and cook foods necessary 
to sustain and build the body — they will know the elements of 
food, the general plan of body building. 

Let us compare the living machine, the human body, to 
the railroad engine or locomotive. For both it is necessary 
to begin by selecting materials for the general structure. 
When these materials have been worked and fitted together, 
fuel must be constantly supplied and an abundance of air to 
make it burn ; and in the third place water is required. As 
a result of this combination, motion, heat and waste are 
produced. 

Pure air is of vast importance in body building. The 
oxygen uniting with the combustible part of the materials 
produces energy. The approximate principles of the body 
are resolved into about sixteen elements, each of which must 
be constantly sustained and nourished. A " perfect " or " com- 
plete" food contains all the elements necessary for the build- 
ing of body. There are in the body five gases: Oxygen, 
hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine and fluorine. The four solids are 
carbon, sulphur, phosphorus and silica. Seven minerals: Cal- 
cium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, manganesium and a trace 
of iron and copper. Oxygen, hydrogen and carbon are found in 
nearly all the tissues and fluids of the body. Seventy-five per

cent, of the adult human body is water ; the proportion is 
greater in infants and less in the aged. It is one of the essen- 
tials in carrying on the vital processes. It dissolves substances 
necessary for the nutrition of the body, and carries from it the 
waste products. It is the medium in which chemical reaction 
takes place, and which carries the nutrient materials from one 
place to another. A considerable increase of water in the body, 
however, is looked upon as unfortunate, while a deficiency, if 
prolonged, causes a retention and accumulation of waste in the 
body, resulting in imperfect nutrition, and is one of the chief 
causes of constipation. 

Potassium chloride is found in the cells of tissues and in the 
muscle juices and nerve tissues. Green plants contain more 
potassium than sodium salts. This is also true of the potato; 
hence, succulent green vegetables supply to the system one of 
the necessary elements. We are told that green vegetables 
have no food value, and, according to the common acceptance 
of the meaning of these words, we can readily understand that 
they lack tissue-building elements ; but they contain salts, which 
play a very important part in body building. Magnesium is 
found with lime in the tissues. No one has ever discovered 
its particular use, but there it is, a constant ingredient in the 
muscles and brain. To have a perfect diet, one must select 
from all the food products, not live on a too concentrated or 
restricted diet. 

Nutrition may be said to take place under five conditions: 
Digestion, absorption, assimilation, destructive metabolism and 
elimination or excretion. The first begins in the mouth and 
continues throughout the alimentary canal ; it is the process 
by which food is converted into assimilable compounds. All 
foods are not immediately assimilated or used ; some are stored 
for future use. For instance, starch is digested and stored in 
the liver as glycogen. The carbo-hydrates are burned for 
heat and energy, and the excess stored as fat in the connective 
tissues. Destructive metabolism is a process that is con- 
tinually going on in the tissues ; a sort of tearing out of the 
dead cells during the activity of building the new. For 
example, the waste products cast out of the lungs are products 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD 11 

of destructive metabolism. They are no longer required by 
the system, are, in fact, in the way, and must be thrown aside 
for new materials. 

The relations between food, exercise and habits of the indi- 
vidual must be in proper proportion to the food ingested. The 
works of the body are of two kinds, muscular and nervous, 
and the internal as well as the external work is done by the 
stored energy produced by the burning or oxidization of the 
foods. Persons frequently forget that every time the heart 
beats, blood is consumed to produce the muscular action. In 
the energy of living, we use blood produced from the food 
we eat. 

Alimentary principles may be divided into three classes: 
The albuminoids, nitrogenous foods or proteids ; three words 
meaning the same, and comprising lean meats, fish, mollusks 
(oysters and clams), the crustaceae (lobsters, crabs, shrimps), 
cheese, casein in milk, legumin found in the leguminous seeds, 
as old peas, beans and lentils, nitrogenous matter in nuts and 
the gluten of grains. The second division, non-nitrogenous or 
carbonaceous foods, consists of fats and the carbo-hydrates, the 
sugars, starches and mucilage, inulin and pectose, found in 
sea weeds and certain vegetables. The third group consists 
of inorganic foods, water and mineral salts. 

Eggs and milk are typical or perfect foods; that is, they 
contain within themselves all the elements necessary for the 
development of the young of their especial kind. The egg is a 
perfect food for the development of the chick, and milk for the 
young mammal; neither of these are, however, perfect foods 
for the human adult. When added to our daily bills of fare 
they are placed in the nitrogenous or albuminous group, and 
served with such foods as white bread and butter. Cows' milk, 
a typical food for the calf, is by no means a typical food for the 
human being. Nor would human milk supply the requirements 
of the calf. The calf gets its growth in from four to five years ; 
from infancy to manhood is three times that long. One can 
see at a glance that such food would quite upset the delicate 
digestive apparatus of an infant. When we go contrary to the 
laws of nature, sickness and suffering are the results. Cows' 



12 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

milk does not agree with the average infant; it was never 
meant to agree and has no right to agree. In vegetable foods 
the carbo-hydrates predominate and must therefore be mixed 
with nitrogenous substances, in order to form a perfect diet. 
Many vegetables are rich in nitrogen, others in starch. In 
arranging our daily bills of fare these must be blended. 

A perfect diet consists of common food materials blended 
to suit the age, sex, occupation and climate in which the indi- 
vidual lives. They must not only be well proportioned, but 
well selected and taken in proper quantities, or they are 
worse than waste, as their presence clogs the delicate digestive 
organs, throwing them out of order. There is more danger 
from over-eating than from under-eating. When persons 
reach middle life or a little beyond there is less vigor, hence, 
less necessity for a large quantity of food. People who dis- 
obey this rule either accumulate fat and become unwieldy, 
or wear out the secretory organs, and have such diseases as 
gout, rheumatism, Bright's disease, and many kindred com- 
plaints. Rich and highly-seasoned dishes please the palate and 
induce the thoughtless to take greater quantities of food than 
can be assimilated ; too much meat, too many starchy foods and 
sweets with too few green vegetables and fruits produce torpid 
or over-worked livers. Men as a class eat too much meat, and 
are prone to kidney and liver troubles ; women eat too much 
starch mixed with sugar and cooked butter, as in cakes, pre- 
serves and puddings, and are prone to corpulency and con- 
stipation. 

The total amount of food required each twenty-four hours 
varies, of course, with the occupation and condition of the 
individual. The average adult in exercise requires as a day's 
ration about six pounds; of this amount about three and a 
half pounds will be water, much of which is found in the 
common foods and taken in beverages. Of the remaining 
part, one-fourth will be nitrogenous matter; three-fourths 
carbonaceous, with about two hundred grains of mineral mat- 
ter. This is not the amount consumed by the average Ameri- 
can, but the amount he should consume. 

Animal foods, being richer in albuminoids or nitrogenous 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD 13 

constituents, must be taken in small quantities. By mixing 
a small amount of lean beef with bread or potato we get a 
food palatable, attractive and containing the necessary require- 
ments. A mixture of beans and potatoes will contain rather 
more of the tissue-building elements. It would require two 
pounds of ordinary bread to supply the nitrogen in twelve 
ounces of meat. Three meals a day might be arranged from a 
table of ingredients containing the proper proportions of all 
the elements: 

Bread 12 oz. 

Butter 3 '* 

Milk 4 •* 

Potato 6 " 

Rice 4 '* 

Cabbage 6 ** 

Cheese 4 '* 

Sugar I " 

Water alone, including that in tea and coffee . . 55 ** 

A second illustration will give another example of the same 
idea: 

Beef, weighed raw 12 oz. 

Whole wheat bread 23 ♦* 

Butter 3 •♦ 

Potato 10 ** 

Water 55 ** 

Each one of these articles may be replaced by another 
of the same class. For instance, old beans are nitrogenous 
or muscle-making foods and may be substituted for beef; 
cheese, the casein of milk, may be substituted for either 
beef or beans; rice, macaroni, white bread, boiled chestnuts, 
white or sweet potatoes, are each interchangeable one with 
the other, at different meals. Olive oil, cream, oleaginous 
nuts and butter are also interchangeable. When green or suc- 
culent vegetables or fruits are used, less water is required. It 
is wise to serve fruits with cereals or breads, vegetables with 
meats, cream with starchy puddings, olive oil with green vege- 
tables. Digestion is more easily performed with correct com- 
binations. 



14 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Starch docs not occur in animal foods, but nitrogen is found 
abundantly in many vegetables. Nitrogenous foods are, as a 
rule, more easily digested uncooked. All starchy foods must 
be well and thoroughly cooked. 

In old peas, beans and lentils the starch is so incorporated 
with legumin, the nitrogenous principle, that the cooking must 
be long and slowly done in order to soften the envelope or wall 
of the starch granules, otherwise fermentation or flatulency 
will result. 

The first object of cooking is to assist digestion. Careful, 
simple cooking only can do this ; for instance, baked or boiled 
potatoes are easily digested; when fried the starch granules 
are covered with a coating of fat which prevents digestive 
secretions from acting on them; frying renders them difficult 
of digestion. A large quantity of fried foods may be eaten 
without nourishing the body; and of one thing we are quite 
sure, they always tax the digestive organs. Many foods are 
chemically changed in the process of digestion. Starch is not 
found in the blood as starch, but is changed by enzymes (unor- 
ganized ferments) in the digestive secretions, into sugar. The 
ptyalin of the saliva, the pepsin and rennin of the stomach, the 
trypsin, amylopsin, and steapsin of the intestinal secretions are 
ensymes. 

The enzyme ptyalin in the saliva (an alkaline medium) acts 
upon the starch precisely the same as diastase, which is found 
in the common malt extracts. If our foods are well cooked and 
thoroughly masticated we assist in the digestion of the starches 
and save the cost of " aids to digestion." Digestion is natural ; 
indigestion, the artificial digestion, unnatural. 

The secretions of the stomach are slightly acid and have 
no effect upon starches. The starches are separated in the 
stomach from other substances and passed on into the second 
stomach, the duodenum, the upper part of the small intestine, 
where again, in the presence of alkaline secretions, they meet 
the enzyme amylopsin, which continues and completes the 
digestion begun in the mouth. 

The nitrogenous foods are torn apart by mastication; they 
enter the stomach (an acid medium), and in the presence of 



CHEMISTRY OF FOOD 



15 



the enzyme pepsin are partly or wholly digested, as the con- 
ditions may be; if the digestion is not finished, they pass 
into the duodenum where in the presence of an alkaline 
medium, digestion is continued by the enzyme trypsin. The 
oils are emulsionized in the small intestine in an alkaline 
medium, by enzyme steapsin and the bile. 

Defective teeth and hasty mastication are frequently the 
primary causes of indigestion. Soft foods are to be especially 
condemned; mushes, for instance, should be masticated, other- 
wise they pass into the small intestine in an unprepared condi- 
tion. Starches are burned in the body to produce heat and 
energy; they also produce fat. If taken in excess of that 
needed for immediate use, are stored as fat in the connective 
tissue. Fats and oils are burned in the body to produce heat 
and energy. Too much starch and sugar increase the weight 
of the body and crowd the liver. The albuminoids build the 
muscular lean flesh and tissues. Mineral matter aids in the 
formation of the teeth and bones. The cereals are rich in these 
salts, hence, are admirable foods for the young, not infants, 
but for children sufficiently old to have teeth for mastication, 
and for nursing mothers,

KITCHEN CALENDAR 



The inexperienced housewife finds more or less difficulty in 
determining the exact time required for cooking the various 
vegetables and meats so that they may all be done for the same 
meal at the same time. Thermometers for ovens have not, until 
recently, been in general use. Now one can have the so-called 
''thermometer," really an indicator, put into the oven door of 
any modern range, either gas, coal or wood, and at a very 
small cost ; thus relieving the cook from the necessity of stand- 
ing and watching and making unsatisfactory attempts to ascer- 
tain the true heat of the oven. One cannot always tell what 
is meant by a moderate, moderately cool or quick oven, unless 
one has had long experience, and even then there is a lack of 
exactness and an unusual amount of worry. In this calendar, 
we refer only to Fahrenheit. 

A potato will bake in three-quarters of an hour at a tem- 
perature of 300° Fahr. ; it will harden on the outside and almost 
burn at a temperature of 400° in twenty minutes, and if the 
oven is only 220° it will take one hour and a quarter to a half. 

In boiling meats always use boiling water and after the first 
five minutes of rapid boiling reduce the temperature to 180°, 
and cook twenty minutes to each pound. The meat must always 
be covered with water. 

In making stews where the meat is cut into small pieces, it 
is better to heat it at first in a little fat, then make the sauce and 
allow the meat to cook for two hours at a temperature of 180°. 

An eight pound turkey with stuffing should go into an oven 
at 400° for a half hour to seal the outside, and then bake at 
280° for two hours longer. Without stuffing, the oven must be 
400° for a half hour and then dropped to 280° for an hour and 
a half. 

A four pound chicken with stuffing will bake at 400° for a

half hour ; and then one and a half hours at 280° ; the same 
sized chicken not stuffed, a half hour at 400°, then one hour at 
280°. 

A tame duck stuffed with potatoes placed in an oven at 360° 
requires one hour to brown and one hour at 230° to finish. 

A goose must be cooked according to its age, and it is very 
difficult to select a young goose unless one is experienced. See 
directions for selecting geese. If they are stuffed with potatoes, 
cook in an oven at 400° for thirty minutes ; then for two hours 
at 230°, basting frequently. 

SCHEDULE FOR FISH AND GAME 

Fish take on their weight in length rather than bulk, which 
gives a specific time independent of weight. Brown quickly for 
a half hour, then cook at 300° for a second half hour. Planked 
fish under the gas or before a wood fire will require thirty 
minutes, and in a coal, wood or oil oven forty-five minutes. 

Oysters are done when the gills are thoroughly curled. 

Game such as woodcock, snipe and pheasants, must be 
roasted or baked continuously for thirty minutes at 400°. 

Partridge, split down the back, thirty minutes at 400°. 

Prairie chicken forty-five minutes at 400°. 

A haunch of venison will cook in a quick oven at 400° about 
thirty minutes, then bake slowly for two hours at 300°, basting 
frequently. 

To test run a skewer in the fleshy part and if the blood fol- 
lows upon drawing the skewer out and the meat at the same 
time is tender and rare, it is done. 

All red meats should be served rare; all white meats well 
done. 

All meats should be nearly done before being seasoned with 
salt, as the salt draws out the juices and toughens the fibre, 
making even good meat dry and unpalatable. 

GENERAL BAKING IN COAL OR WOOD STOVE 

All meats must go into a very hot oven (400°). After they 
have been thoroughly seared on the outside cool down the oven

to 260°, when the fat will begin to melt. Baste with this fat 
every fifteen minutes. Do not use water. 

Bread in small French loaves will be baked continuously 
at 360° for 30 minutes ; square loaves at 300° for ten minutes 
and for fifty minutes at 260°. 

Pastry, such as patties and tarts, for twenty minutes at 360°. 

Mufiins, gems, sally lunns ^nd other light breads twenty 
minutes at 360°. 

Corn bread in shallow pans forty-five minutes at 360". 

Pies with upper crust thirty minutes at 360° ; with under 
crust thirty minutes at 340°. 

Apples, cored, in a slow oven at 260°, so that they may 
become soft without hardening the skin. 

Cakes without butter require a hot oven 300° to 360°. 

Four-egg sponge cake, twenty minutes; six-egg sponge 
cake thirty minutes ; ten-egg sponge cake, forty-five minutes. 

Angel food and sunshine cake, baked in pans made for the 
purpose, require a cool oven, 230°, which is gradually increased 
during the first half hour to 260°, baking in all three-quarters 
of an hour. If the cake is not brown at the end of this time 
increase the heat for just a moment until it assumes the proper 
color. 

Cakes containing butter, such as pound cake, cup cake and 
fruit cake, must be baked in a very slow oven. 

Fruit cake may be steamed for three hours and finished in 
an oven at a temperature of 240°, or it may be put into an oven 
at 220° for three hours and finished at 260° for one hour. 

For gas baking allow twenty degrees less than the above.

PROPER SEASONS FOR. DIFFERENT 
FOODS 

It Is impossible to give the exact seasons for fruits in different 
parts of the United States, but a general idea will be helpful. 

Preserve all fruits when at their height; they are then in 
season. This rule will apply also to canning or jelly making. 
In the South, of course, the time will be earlier than in the far 
North. It is a well-known fact that green fruits contain a 
goodly amount of pectose, which by the action of natural fer- 
ments in the fruit is changed to pectin. This pectin exists in a 
ready formed condition in Irish moss, and is found in fruits just 
ripe. In a day this is again changed, hence over-ripe fruits will 
not make firm jelly. See jelly making. 

Tomatoes should be canned during August ; after that time 
they lose their solidity and become watery, also their sweetness 
of flavor and become more acid. 



MEATS 

Beef and mutton are used the year round, but are really in best 
condition and in season during the winter months. 

Veal and lamb are in season during the spring months, from 
the first of April to the first of June. They are used before and 
after this time, but are not plentiful. 

"Spring" chickens appear about the first of May. With the 
present incubator method of raising chickens, and the "house" 
fashion of raising lambs, we have both at an earlier season, but 
they are high in price, and do not give a corresponding amount 
of nourishment. 

Capons, from December until April. 

Turkeys from September until March. 

Geese and ducks, sold under the name of "green geese" and 
"ducklings," from the first of June to the first of September; 
old ducks and geese, from the first of December to the first of 
April. 



KITCHEN CALENDAR 27 

Guinea fowls are best from the first of June to the first of 
October, although they appear in the markets the year around. 

Game is in season during the fall and winter; the season 
begins about the first of November and closes February first. 

Woodcock are in the market from the first of August to 
January. They are best after the first of October. Cold stor- 
age game is exposed for sale at all seasons, but is undesirable 
food. 

Reed birds or rice birds are in season along the Middle 
Eastern coast from the latter part of August and September 
to October. These are the reed birds of the North and the rice 
birds of the South. 

Rabbits and hares are in season from November first to 
February first; in many places they are in market the year 
round ; they are not good, however, when out of season. 

Venison is good from September first to January first. 

Wild duck, partridges and geese from September first to 
April first ; the choicest of these are the canvas back, red head, 
mallard, teal and widgeon. 

FISH 

JANUARY 

Cod, haddock, lake halibut, chicken halibut, striped bass, eels, 
Columbia River salmon, smelts, red snapper. Nova Scotia 
herring, pickerel, catfish, terrapin, green turtle, scallops, 
oysters, white bait. 

You will find exposed for sale long lists of fish not included 
here. They are not in season, however; but are preserved in 
some fashion, either in cold storage or by freezing, and are not 
wholesome food. We have now coming from the South 
prawns, fresh mackerel and shad. 

FEBRUARY 

Cod-fish, haddock, halibut, striped bass, eels, Columbia River 
salmon, frost fish, Spanish mackerel, sheep's-head, red snapper 
and smelts still coming from Maine and Massachusetts and the 
inferior frozen ones from Canada. During the latter part of this 



28 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

month we have our choicest smelts from Long Island. Southern 
shad are now more plentiful ; salmon, trout, and white fish are 
good. Terrapin, green turtle, scallops and oysters are in fine 
condition. Soft shell crabs are beginning to come, also a little 
fresh crab meat from the Southern waters. 

MARCH 

Cod-fish, haddock, halibut, striped bass, chicken halibut, eels, 
Columbia River salmon, flounders, Spanish mackerel, pompano, 
sheep's-head, red snapper and shad are quite abundant from 
North Carolina and are beginning to come a little farther north. 
Salmon trout, white fish, yellow perch and pickerel are also 
coming in small quantities; terrapin, green turtle, oysters and 
scallops are still in season. During the latter part of the month 
we have salmon coming from the Kennebec and other rivers of 
Maine, and they remain in good condition all through April. 

APRIL 

We have about the same list, adding now good shad, from the 
Susquehanna, Delaware and Hudson Rivers, and fresh mack- 
erel also make their appearance at this season. Sheep's-head 
are still coming from North Carolina as well as king fish; 
smelts go out of season, that is they lose their sweetness ; red 
snapper is in its best condition the middle of this month. Sea 
bass are coming from the North, and blue fish make their 
appearance in southern waters about the middle of the month. 
The season for brook trout opens April first. Salmon trout, 
white fish, green turtle, lobster, prawns, hard shell crabs, and 
crawfish are found in good condition. Scallops leave us at the 
end of this month as well as oysters. We have in their place 
clams. The latter part of this month frogs' legs are in good 
condition and plentiful. 

MAY 

Lobsters, crabs, prawns and shrimps are now in good condition ; 
oysters and scallops have gone, clams of diflFerent varieties 
taking their place. Oregon salmon continues during the entire 
month. Flounders are at their best. Fresh mackerel, Spanish 
mackerel and pompano come in refrigerator cars and are in 



KITCHEN CALENDAR 



29 



good condition. Butterfish and weak fish are plentiful and 
cheap. King fish appear and are good until October. Sheep's- 
head, porgies and sea bass are abundant. Shad now comes 
from the Connecticut waters and is of very superior flavor, but 
is passing out of season, the flesh becoming soft and unpalat- 
able. Brook trout are at their best, and we still have eels and 
striped bass, cod, halibut, chicken halibut and haddock, green 
turtle, and frog's legs. 

JUNE 

Cod-fish has just gone out of season, the flesh is soft and not at 
its best ; cod is truly a winter fish. This may also be said of 
haddock, halibut and chicken halibut. We have striped bass, 
eels, lobsters and fresh salmon from the rivers of Maine and 
Canada, which is cheapest during this season of the year. Black 
bass, fresh mackerel, pompano, Spanish mackerel, weak fish, 
butter fish, king fish, sheep's-head, sea bass, sturgeon and 
porgies, the latter being cheap and perhaps undesirable. A few 
shad are exposed for sale, but they are unpalatable. Blue fish, 
however, are getting larger and are much better than during 
the previous month. This also applies to black bass. 

It may be remembered that striped bass in some markets 
are called rock fish, and are salt water fish ; while black bass 
are fresh water fish. Crabs, lobsters, clams, frogs' legs and 
crawfish are still in season. 

JULY 

Eels, lobsters (from Maine and Canada), pompano, flounders, 
black bass, Spanish mackerel, butter fish, weak fish, sheep's- 
head, porgies, sea bass, blue fish, moon-fish, brook trout, green 
turtle, crawfish, shrimps, frogs' legs and soft crabs are still in 
season. This list will also answer for August. 

SEPTEMBER 

Cod-fish, haddock, halibut are coming, and are in better con- 
dition than during the previous month, but they are not first- 
class until October. Rock or striped bass, lobsters, eels, 
salmons now come from Nova Scotia, and the price is steadily 
advancing and becomes very high until the last of the month, 



30 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

when the East coast salmon go out of season. Flounders, 
black fish, fresh mackerel, Spanish mackerel, the latter being in 
their best condition during this month, pompano, butter fish, 
weak fish, porgies and a few smelts are exposed for sale, but 
are not in good condition, while red snapper is now beginning 
to be more solid, but is not at its best until October. The 
grunter, a fish similar to the red snapper, is also in season. Sea 
bass and blue fish, salmon trout, white fish, cod-fish and porgies, 
green turtle, crawfish, frogs' legs, lobsters, hard crabs and soft 
crabs are high in price, and are, perhaps, in their best condition. 
Moon-fish, butter fish and oysters are exposed for sale, but are 
not fine. Clams, hard and soft, and soft crabs are now coming 
from the East coast, north of New York. 

OCTOBER 

Cod-fish during the latter part of the month are in better con- 
dition ; striped bass or rock fish, lobsters, black fish, Columbia 
River salmon are here, but are not as fine as those caught on the 
Maine coast, which come earlier in the season. Flounders, 
fresh mackerel, Spanish mackerel, pompano, weak fish, king 
fish, sheep's-head, grunter, red snapper, white perch, sea bass, 
black bass, blue fish, salmon trout, white fish, yellow perch, 
pickerel, masquallonge, green turtle, carp, oysters, clams, hard 
and soft crabs, crawfish and prawns. Hard and soft crabs are 
now passing out of the market. White bait and scallops are 
beginning to make their appearance, but are not in as good 
condition as they are in November. Oysters are getting better. 

NOVEMBER 

Cod is now in fine flavor. Haddock, halibut, rock or striped 
bass, salmon, trout, fresh mackerel, grunter, perch, red snapper, 
smelts are in good condition. Black blass, white fish, yellow 
perch, pickerel, masquallonge and blue fish are in good condi- 
tion up until about the middle of the month, and those exposed 
for sale during the winter months are preserved by freezing. 
Masquallonge, cod-fish, green turtle, terrapin, red snapper are 
fairly good. Oysters are better ; frogs' legs, hard crabs, craw- 
fish and prawns are rather going out of season.

During this month oysters are in fine condition, also scallops, 
smelts, while lobster and crustaceae in general are in poor, soft 
condition. Oysters and scallops come in as the lobsters go out ; 
flounders, terrapin, halibut, cod-fish are now at their best. Rock 
or striped bass, Columbia River salmon, frost fish, tom cods, 
cusk, black fish, red snapper, black bass, pickerel, masquallonge, 
green turtle, and shad from the St. John River, Florida, are 
exposed for sale in the markets ; they have been transported, of 
course, in refrigerator cars ; they are not fine in flavor and are 
quite high in price. 

VEGETABLES 

Our rapid transportation makes it almost impossible to give 
exact time when vegetables are in season. Our country being 
large, the climate so very different in different parts, vegetables, 
like fruit, are in season the whole year. Celery in New York, 
Philadelphia and Boston is truly in season during the winter; 
from the South, as early as July ist. Lettuce can be had all the 
year round ; in the winter it is grown in hot houses, or comes 
from the far South ; while in summer we have a home produc- 
tion,N which is less desirable than that grown in winter. 

Mushrooms are grown in cellars or fields, and can be pur- 
chased at any season. We have a number of vegetables that 
can be grown in any garden during the summer and put aside 
to keep for winter use. It is well to remember that appetites 
are destroyed by too much sameness. Use vegetables in sea- 
son in the locality in which you live. Such vegetables as car- 
rots, turnips, parsnips, beets, cabbage, onions, celery, salsify, 
ieeks, endive and potatoes are easily kept for winter use. This 
relieves you of the necessity of canning vegetables. Tarragon, 
parsley and herbs may be dried just before the flowering season. 
Green peppers and okra are also easily dried. The winter vege- 
tables are greater in number than the summer ones, hence it is 
not necessary to can and preserve such foods, unless one lives 
on a narrow diet. 

Winter vegetables are sweet and white potatoes, artichokes,

celery, endive, cabbage, onions, leeks, chicory, yellow and white 
turnips, kale, winter squash, pumpkins, mushrooms, old peas, 
beans, lentils, old beets, salsify, carrots and parsnips. 

Spring. — All the above with spinach, scullions, dandelions, 
asparagus, poke, corn, salad and early lettuce added.

tuce, fresh sweet peppers, mushrooms, summer cabbage, egg 
plant, okra, Brussels sprouts and onions. 

Autumn or Fall. — Potatoes, sweet and white; celery, cab- 
bage, tomatoes, peppers, lima beans, corn, Brussels sprouts, 
kidney beans, onions, cos 'or Romaine, new white turnips and 
new carrots.

METHODS OF COOKING 



Primitive man, no doubt, could easily masticate and digest his 
raw wheat, but in the present generation under existing circum- 
stances this is entirely out of the question. Heat does not 
always alter the chemical constituents of food, but when prop- 
erly applied, practically aids digestion. Such changes may not 
be detected by chemical analysis, and yet be perceptible to the 
digestive apparatus. 

Heat coagulates and hardens albumin. Thus we say meats 
are rendered less digestible by cooking. Cooking is necessary, 
however, to remove the danger of poisonous germs. The 
woody fibre of vegetables is softened by moist, slow cooking, 
the starch cells are ruptured, and the whole is made more easy 
of digestion. A slow, moist heat softens the fibre of meat ; an 
intense heat hardens and toughens it. Meat slowly cooked at 
a temperature of i8o° Fahr. becomes tender, juicy and easily 
digested ; when boiled at a gallop the connective dissolves, the 
meat falls from the bones and into strings, but the fibre is not 
tender. Such boiled meat is leathery and difficult of digestion. 

The cooking of meat also enables it to be more readily 
masticated. In the raw state it is rather tough and can be torn 
apart only with great difficulty. One can easily observe this by 
the method in which the lion pulls the flesh from the bones 
while he is eating. 

Albumin exists in the juices of meat as well as in the blood, 
and unless the outside of each piece is coagulated ("sealed") 
at once, much nourishment is lost, but a continued high tem- 
perature is a disadvantage. 

The results of cooking depend much more upon the skill of 
the cook than the amount of money spent for material. 

A piece of so-called inferior meat in the hands of an edu- 
cated cook will be sent to the table palatable, sightly and nutri-

tious. But the finest roasts our markets afford are dry, tasteless 
and valueless when badly cooked. 

The most experienced chemist with all his modern appa- 
ratus cannot demonstrate the causes and sources of flavors. 
Practical taste and experience alone create and detect flavors — 
the cook holds the secret. 

The pleasure of eating, digestion and health depend upon 
the knowledge of the cook. Good, wholesome and nutritious 
food is always attractive, palatable and pleasure giving. 

Heat is applied to animal and all vegetable foods, either by 
boiling, steaming and braising — moist heats; broiling or 
grilling and roasting — dry heat in an abundance of air; 
baking — dry heat, as in an oven ; frying — immersing in hot fat ; 
and sauteing — cooking in a little fat. 

THE STOVES AND FUEL WITH WHICH WE COOK 

Combustion or burning means the rapid union of a substance 
with oxygen. The temperature at which the burning takes 
place is called the kindling point. The article burned is burned 
or oxidized. This burning is also called oxidization. Oxygen 
exists free (this means that it is not combined with other 
materials) in the air, and forms about one-fifth of its volume. 
Wood, oil and coal are composed mainly of carbon and hydro- 
gen, and are all incapable of supporting combustion or burning 
without the assistance of oxygen. Hence, all our household 
structures or stoves for the burning of wood or coal have a 
draft at the bottom of the fire-box. 

In gas and oil stoves oxygen is supplied through perfora- 
tions at the base of the burners. In a gas stove we call them 
mixers, or Bunsen burners. In an oil stove a perforated tube 
encircles the wick, allowing the air to enter equally at all points. 
This mixture of air with the gas produced by the burning wick 
gives the blue flame, the same as the burner on the gas stove. 
Where a balance is kept up there are no free particles of carbon 
to deposit themselves upon the utensils in the form of soot. 
Too much air hinders combustion ; the direct pipe or chimney 
damper should be closed as soon as the fire is kindled. This 



METHODS OF COOKING 85 

will save the fuel and keep up an Intense and even heat through- 
out the stove. All properly arranged stove drafts are adapted 
to the size of the fire-box and constructed to admit the least 
possible quantity of air beyond that necessary for active com- 
bustion. The cook who opens wide the lower door has not yet 
learned how to make or keep a good cooking fire. When the 
fire does not burn she gives it an occasional *'poke," which still 
further deadens it. 

Gas is the cheapest and most easily managed of all fuels, 
providing care is given to its use. A good gas stove well 
managed will, counting in the time for care and lack of dust, 
cost one-third less than coal. A good blue-flame oil stove is 
quite its equal as far as cooking is concerned, but requires more 
care, as it must be filled and have the wicks adjusted each day. 
In the hands of a careful cook neither gas nor oil stoves give 
off unpleasant odors. For all cooking purposes, a blue flame 
is desirable. For illumination, a red flame. Coal and charcoal 
are mostly carbon in rather an impure state. Hard or anthra- 
cite coal being dense, almost pure carbon, must be heated 
throughout before combustion will take place. For this reason, 
on kindling a coal fire some lighter material which will, while 
burning, heat the coal, must be used. When once heated to the 
point of combustion the coal readily takes fire, and other coal 
placed on top of the hot coal will, in turn, burn. Wood on top 
of coal deadens and smothers the fire. 

Boxes or stoves used for heating or cooking purposes are 
not complete unless they are attached to a chimney or flue. 
Flames tend upward ; heated air expands, becomes lighter and is 
pressed upward by the heavier air with which it is surrounded. 
The fire is kindled at the bottom of the stove where the cold air 
enters the fire-box, and this is also at the bottom of the chimney. 
Thus, as the air is heated, it is pressed upward in the chimney, 
causing a "draft." The cold air coming in at the bottom in its 
turn is heated, and so keeps on this continuous pushing upward. 
The chimney also serves to carry off the poisonous products of 
combustion. Any interference with the upward tendency of the 
hot air causes the chimney to smoke. There are several causes 
for smoky chimneys. The rate of motion of the current varies 



36 MRS. RORER*S NEW COOK BOOK 

with the size, height or length and temperature of the chimney. 
A cold chimney, one that has been standing idle all summer, 
or a new chimney will smoke. The fresh brick and mortar are 
good conductors of heat, and absorb it so rapidly that the rising 
current becomes cold, condenses and obstructs the ascent. The 
smoke crowded underneath fills the chimney and is forced down 
and into the room. To avoid this, start a fresh fire with an 
abundance of light material, such as shavings or excelsior, until 
the chimney is heated and the smoke begins to ascend easily; 
then add hard wood or coal. 

It must be remembered that with this smoke come also the 
poisonous products of combustion, which make a perfect flue a 
necessity. The higher the chimney, the greater the draft. A 
brick chimney, however, may be so high that it will cool the air 
current below the top or outlet. For this reason, pipes of 
galvanized iron are used as extension shafts. High buildings 
and tall trees overshadowing a chimney frequently disturb the 
draft, which is another cause for smoking chimneys. The wind 
passes down the chimney with sufficient rapidity to cool the 
ascending air, which is forced back and down into the room. 

In wood fires we frequently notice volumes of flame coming 
out through the openings of the stove. Such conditions can be 
regulated only by extensions to the chimney. An ordinary 
cook stove with such a draft would, on a quiet day, bake beauti- 
fully, but never when the wind is blowing. To condemn a 
stove thus placed would be folly. In this country there are very 
few ill-constructed cooking-stoves; the defects are usually in 
the chimneys. Chimneys built on the south or east side of a 
house give less trouble than those on the west or north side. 
The cold air is apt to chill them. 

When there are two fireplaces in the house, or a fireplace 
below and a stove entering the chimney above, the fire in one or 
the other will not burn well unless the one not used is closed. 
For example, if a fire is lighted on the first floor and the stove 
or pipe hole is open on the second, the current is interrupted 
and the room will fill with smoke and gas. This difficulty will 
be remedied by keeping the stove closed on the second floor 
while the fire is burning on the first floor, or closing the 



METHODS OF COOKING 



37 



chimney place below, or lighting a fire in it when there is a fire 
on the second floor. Air entering a flue or stovepipe horizon- 
tally will also interrupt the draft. For this reason a damper in 
the stovepipe is used to cool off or check the fire. 

Anthracite coal being nearly solid carbon may be arranged 
to "keep." To accomplish this, lift the lid on the top of the 
stove, or open a little damper at the top of the fire-box ; this will 
allow cold air to enter, pass over the upper surface of the coal, 
chill it, and prevent rapid burning. As this is imperfect com- 
bustion, great care must be taken to have the chimney flue open, 
that the products of combustion may not come out into the 
room. Carbon-monoxide, the product of imperfect combustion, 
is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas. Being an accumulative 
poison it is still more dangerous. As hard coal contains a little 
sulphur, the odor of the sulphur is noticed, when the drafts are 
imperfect, which is like the sounding of an alarm-bell, for 
carbon-monoxide is found in its company. 

Gas stoves used continually for cooking purposes must, like 
coal stoves, be attached to a chimney to carry off the poisonous 
products of combustion. There is less danger in summer, when 
all doors and windows are open, 



GAS COOKERY 

The application of heat is just the same, no matter what fuel 
is used. Oil, gas, wood or coal gives about the same result, 
when managed by a trained housewife. Gas cooking is the 
ideal cooking. It is economical and cleanly, two very important 
points. Roasting and broiling in a gas stove are done under- 
neath the gas jets, in other words in the lower oven, by some 
called the broiling oven or broiling chamber. The oven must 
be heated for five or eight minutes before using. 

Where economy of space must be observed a small flat top 
gas stove with three burners with a steam cooker and a portable 
oven, will easily serve a family of six to eight. The baking is 
done precisely the same as in any other stove. Heat all ovens 
thoroughly before putting in the articles. Some cakes require 



38 MRS. 

a cool oven, but even then the jets must be lighted a few 
minutes before using the oven. For meats and all articles 
requiring a very hot oven, light the gas five minutes before using 
the oven, from three to four if a cool oven is called for. 

To use gas economically, one must always keep in mind the 
capacity of a single burner. The gas must be lighted when you 
are ready to use it, and turned out the moment you have fin- 
ished. Under such circumstances, taking also into considera- 
tion that it does not require time for replenishing, as an oil, 
coal or wood stove, and there is no dust or ashes to remove, 
gas is the cheapest of all fuels. In preparing a dinner on a 
gas stove, select vegetables that may be cooked in the oven, 
and meat cooked in the underneath oven or broiling chamber, 
or materials that may be cooked in a steam cooker on top 
of the stove on a single burner. By paying attention to details 
of this kind a gas range may be used, the necessary water 
heated for scullery and laundry purposes, at a cost of not over 
$10 per quarter; much cheaper than coal for the same amount 
of work. 

A sample dinner prepared at a minimum cost: 

Cream of Pea Soup 

Broiled Steak 

Baked Potatoes Scalloped Tomatoes 

Salad 
Mock Charlotte 

First prepare the charlotte. In so doing, use one burner 
on the top of the stove, allowing five minutes for its use. An 
hour before dinner time, light the oven burners ; when the indi- 
cator registers 9, wash the potatoes, put them in a baking pan 
and in the oven on the grate. Prepare the scalloped tomatoes, 
stand them aside as they require but twenty minutes cooking. 
Trim and wipe the steak ready for broiling. It will require 
fifteen minutes, and the broiling chamber is already heated. 
Light a top burner for the pea soup, which will be made while 
you are broiling the steak, if canned peas are used ; if fresh, 
allow fifteen minutes for the first boiling of the peas, press 
them through a colander, and finish while the steak is broiling. 



METHODS OF COOKING 39 

Twenty minutes before dinner place the tomatoes in the 
oven. In five minutes put the steak underneath. Now finish 
up the soup. Turn out the burner, the water in the under 
boiler will keep it sufficiently hot. The potatoes are done. Take 
each one carefully in a napkin ; press it until it is perfectly soft 
within the skin, being careful not to break the skin, and dish 
them on a folded napkin. Dish and season the steak. Turn 
out the oven burners at once. Place everything in the oven 
to keep warm while the soup is being served. The cooking 
of all this dinner, if carefully managed, will cost not more 
than five cents. 

Let us observe for a moment the reverse of this meal. We 
will have boiled or mashed potatoes ; these will require an extra 
burner. Select stewed tomatoes instead of baked. These will 
take another burner. The soup will take the third, and the oven 
will be lighted for twenty or twenty-five minutes for heating 
and broiling the steak. It can be seen at a glance that seven 
or eight cents will be required against the five cents in the 
first case. Large gas bills are not, as a rule, caused by the stove 
or the meter, but the lack of thought or knowledge of the cook. 

Where long, slow cooking becomes necessary, as in the 
making of stock and the cooking of cereals, use the simmering 
burner, after the articles have first been brought to boiling 
point. On baking days where six or eight loaves of bread 
must be baked at one time, put four on the underneath grate 
and four on the upper grate. After the bread has been baking 
fifteen minutes change the upper for the under row; turn 
down the burners to the minimum and bake slowly after the 
loaves have all been nicely browned. When using the oven 
for baking purposes, it is wise to select a small roast or a steak 
for the dinner, as these can be roasted or broiled underneath, 
thus again making double use of the oven burners. When 
baking cakes or cinnamon bun, that require a slow fire, chicken 
or fricandeau may be cooked underneath. A slow fire is much 
the better roasting fire. In baking, light the oven burners at 
least five minutes before putting the articles in the oven. 
Meats or poultry require a very quick oven. Heat the oven 
until the indicator points to 12 ; continue at full heat until the 



40 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

meat is seared on the outside, then turn down the gas until the 
hand runs back to 8 and cook slowly fifteen minutes to each 
pound. For pastry the indicator should point to lo; bake at 
this temperature for five minutes, then cool to 9 and finish the 
baking. Bread in square loaves does not require extreme heat. 
The indicator should register 8 during the entire baking. For 
large loaves, gradually increase to 9, at which point the baking 
will be finished. For angel food, sunshine and sponge cake, 
start at 6; increase the heat slowly for 20 minutes until it 
registers 8 ; finish cooking at this point. Three-quarters of an 
hour is the time allowed for the baking. For cakes containing 
butter, heat to 6 before putting in the cakes ; after twenty min- 
utes increase the heat to 8, and finish. Bake a cup, or pound 
cake at slow heat, register at 7, for two hours, 



TO BROIL STEAK 

Light the oven burners at least five minutes before the time 
for broiling. Allow twelve to fifteen minutes for a steak an 
inch and a half thick. When the rack and pan are hot, place 
the steak on the rack, and put it as near the flames as possible 
without having it touch. As soon as it is seared and brown on 
one side, turn, sear and brown on the other. Now turn again. 
Remove the rack three or four slides down, but do not reduce 
the heat. Cook for five minutes ; turn the steak and broil for 
five minutes longer and it is ready to season and serve. 

A steak properly broiled will be " done " throughout, rare 
and juicy, not raw or purple in the middle, as is usually the case 
over a coal fire. Broil chops the same as steak. For broiling 
or planking fish, heat the oven five minutes, and place the fish 
flesh side up ; when nicely browned, turn down the burners and 
cook slowly for a half hour. Fish cooked under the gas is 
most delicious. 

In these days good cooks no longer guess at oven tempera- 
tures. They have positive results ; gas, as well as wear and tear 
on one's nerves, are saved. One knows when the oven is ready, 
how much to reduce the heat, and how to regulate until the 



METHODS OF COOKING 41 

baking is done. There is no opening or closing of the doors, 
allowing the escape of the heat during baking. The tempera- 
tures given above are exclusively for gas cooking. 

BOILING 

It may seem presumptuous to suggest that few people know 
how to boil water, but such is the case. During my experience 
as a teacher, which extends over a period of twenty years, I can 
safely say that not more than fifty ladies applying for admis- 
sion to my school have been able to tell what is meant by the 
"boiling of water," or the different temperatures at which it 
boils, and why, and what chemical changes take place during 
and after the boiling. We boil water in the kitchen for two 
purposes : for the cooking of the water itself frequently to 
remove dangerous germs, and for the purpose of cooking other 
materials. The average housewife — I am speaking now of the 
masses — has few conveniences for experimental examinations, 
hence she must take a great deal for granted. The boiling 
point, under ordinary atmospheric pressure (sea level), is 212° 
Fahr. ; this point changes according to the altitude. When 
bubbles form on the bottom of the kettle, come clear to the sur- 
face and rupture quietly without making an ebullition, the water 
is simmering. At this point the thermometer should register 
180° Fahr., and it is at this temperature that we cook meats and 
make soups. When the bubbles begin to form on the sides and 
bottom of the vessel and come toward the top of the water, 
there is a motion in the water, but it is not really boiling hot ; 
it is simply giving back the atmospheric gases which have been 
absorbed within. It is only when the thermometer reaches 
212° Fahr. and the water is in rapid motion that it can be called 
boiling water, and the atmospheric gases still continue to be 
given off with the steam for a considerable time after the water 

I has commenced to boil rapidly ; in fact, it is difficult to deter- 
mine when the last traces have been expelled. It is safe to 
suppose, however, that ten minutes' boiling will free the water 
from its gases, make it tasteless and render it unfit for the 
making of tea, coffee or other light infusions of delicate 
materials. By filtering boiled water, allowing it to drop from 
1 



42 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

an upper into a lower vessel, it will be aerated and assume its 
original flavor. Boiled water is flat. The mineral matter in 
this water, which is calcareous, is precipitated. Our tea-kettle, 
if not cleaned daily, becomes encrusted with these materials. 

We speak of boiling meats, boiling eggs, boiling vegetables, 
but we know that these materials are much better when cooked 
in water below the boiling point. But it is very difficult to get 
rid of the term "boiled." Boiled meat is not boiled at all, but is 
cooked far below the boiling point that the fibre may be softened 
and the meat made tender. The meat itself does not boil, even 
if the water surrounding it is boiling. Boil a piece of meat at 
full gallop for thirty minutes, after the meat has been thor- 
oughly heated, plunge a thermometer into the centre of the 
meat, and to your surprise it will not register over 170° Fahr. 
Meats baked in very hot ovens register about the same. 

Boiling is one of the simplest and best methods of cooking 
the so-called inferior pieces of meat, and consists in plunging 
the whole piece into a large kettle of boiling water. The meat 
must be entirely covered, boiling rapidly for five minutes, the 
temperature of the water then lowered to 160° or 180° Fahr., 
and the cooking continued at this temperature. Some cooks 
lower the water to 130°, especially for mutton. 

Meat loses greater weight in the boiling than by any other 
process. The better pieces of meat, such as the round and 
shoulder, lose about twenty-five per cent., and such a piece as 
the brisket, being rich in fat, loses forty per cent. Four pounds 
of beef will lose one pound. Four pounds of mutton will lose 
fourteen ounces. 

Salt meats that have already parted with a large portion of 
their juices must be thoroughly washed in cold water and put 
on to boil in cold water ; the water in which they were boiled 
may be saved for other purposes. All water in which meats are 
boiled should be saved for stock and sauces. For soups, start 
always with cold water. 

All vegetables go over the fire in boiling water ; there is no 
exception to this rule. Such as turnips, cauliflower, cabbage 
and Brussels sprouts, after the first boil, must be cooked slowly 
in an uncovered kettle. 



METHODS OF COOKING 43 

Rice and macaroni boil rapidly, not that rapidly boiling 
water gives a greater degree of heat, but the motion washes 
apart or separates the particles or grains. Rice cooked slowly 
in a small quantity of water is heavy and unsightly. 

STEAMING 

Steaming is an admirable method of cooking tough meats or 
hams, fruit cakes, puddings and things requiring a long, moist 
heat. Modern housewives use for this purpose a ''cooker" or 
sterilizer. The old-fashioned perforated steamer over a kettle 
of boiling water will, however, answer every purpose. Steam- 
ing requires a little longer time than boiling. Potatoes, rice, 
peas, beans, corn, squash, cucumbers and pumpkins may be 
steamed. 

Materials never boil in a double boiler, nor are they steamed. 
Things cooked in a double boiler are cooked below boiling 
point. For making custards, scalding milk or cooking cereals, 
it is most advantageous, as it removes all danger of burning. 

ROASTING 

By this method the nutritive juices and the flavor extractives, 
are more thoroughly retained than by any other method of 
cooking. Roasting and broiling are practically the same, and 
mean to expose one side of the meat to the fire, while the other 
is exposed to the fresh air. The method is almost obsolete in 
this country, as conveniences for such cooking have gone out 
of date. In our hurried life such methods are too slow, except 
where the gauze door oven is used. Baking has almost entirely 
substituted the roasting of beef. Roasting most thoroughly and 
quickly seals the juices on the outside, forming a crust which 
acts as a barrier, preventing further escape of the juices. The 
meat loses less weight than by boiling, is richer and finer 
in flavor. Beef, mutton, game, turkeys or chickens, in fact all 
meats with the exception of pork and veal have the best and 
highest flavor when cooked in this fashion. The loss of weight 
in roasting is due to the loss of water and fat, which amount to 
about twenty per cent. 



44 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

BAKING 

This is a method of cooking in the oven of a stove. It is by 
no means an inferior way of cooking meat, providing the 
basting is carefully done. We bake our bread, cake, potatoes 
and tomatoes, meats, poultry and game. Four pounds of beef 
will lose in baking one pound three ounces ; four pounds of 
mutton will lose in baking one pound four ounces. 

STEWING OR FRICASSEEING 

This is really "boiling," in a sauce. After the meat has been 
browned either by throwing it into a hot pan or into a little hot 
fat, it is cooked in a brown sauce at a temperature of i8o° Fahr. 
If the mixture is allowed to boil hard during the cooking it will 
become tough and shriveled. When properly stewed the 
texture is soft and loose and readily breaks down under masti- 
cation. This is why we are told that stewed meats are easy of 
digestion. Stewing is the most economical method of cooking 
meats. There is practically no loss. The loss in weight is not 
15 per cent., and what is lost to the meat is held in the sauce, 
so that really one gets a full return for each dollar spent. 

BRAISING 

Braising is a cross between boiling and baking, a method 
largely employed in France ; hence we take for granted that it 
must be an economical way of cooking meats. It is best 
adapted to inferior pieces, those requiring long, slow cooking. 
A covered pan is employed for the purpose, and in this country 
is called a ''roasting pan ;" but we cannot "roast" in a covered 
pan. The meat is placed in the pan, the pan partly filled with 
stock or water, then closely covered and placed in a well heated 
oven. The meat browns even while the water in the pan is 
evaporating; tough or dense flesh, such as that found in old 
poultry or cattle illy fed, when cooked in this manner, is tender 
and palatable, hence more easy of digestion. It is also a choice 
method of cooking veal and pork. Flavor insipid meat, such 



METHODS OF COOKING 45 

as veal, with bay leaf, carrots, onions and various herbs placed 
in the pan during the braising. The loss to the meat in cooking 
is held in the water or stock which is used for the sauce. 



BROILING OR GRILLING 

This is the same as roasting, applied to a smaller portion of 
meat. We broil or grill our steaks, chops, spring chicken 
and fish. 

FRYING 

By frying we mean cooking by immersion in hot fat at a tem- 
perature of 350° to 380° Fahr. There must be sufficient fat in 
the pan to wholly cover each article. We fry such things as cro- 
quettes, egg plant and oysters. This method is less injurious 
than sauteing. When fats are heated to a high temperature, 
fatty acids are developed, which greatly irritate the digestive 
organs. Fried meats are always to be avoided even by persons 
with strong digestion. They will in time produce disorders of 
the digestive tract. 

The art of frying is little understood in the average house- 
hold. The products of the frying pan are usually indigestible, 
greasy, unsightly and unpalatable. Fats over-heated, before 
the articles are fried, are most injurious. If too cool, foods are 
greasy and under-done. An article well fried will come from 
the fat as free from grease as though it had been cooked in 
water. 

A croquette that will soil the fingers as it is taken from the 
fat is not fit for food. Fried oysters leaving their marks on the 
serving plate are certaintly not palatable or dainty. Oil is the 
best material for frying. "Ko-nut" or "Nut-ko," made from 
cocoanut, a cocoanut butter, is also excellent. The compounds 
sold under various names as cottosuet, cottolene and vegetole 
are mixtures of suet and cotton-seed oil, are wholesome and 
give better results than lard. Lard is last to be chosen, it 
absorbs easily, consequently is expensive. Foods fried in pure 
lard are greasy and rather oflfensive. All warmed-over foods, 
as croquettes and cecils, must be dipped in Qgg and rolled in 



46 

bread crumbs before frying. The egg rich in albumin coagu- 
lates, forming a thin grease-proof covering over the outside, as 
soon as they are put into the hot fat. Thus articles are cooked 
in fat v^ithout taking up the fat. This fat, when cool, must be 
strained and put aside to use over and over again, as long as it 
lasts. Ten pounds of fat w^ill last the entire winter, and you 
may fry four or five times a week, if the digestion of the family 
will allow. 

SAUTEING 

This is cooking in a small quantity of fat. An omelet, lyon 
naise potatoes, hash brown potatoes are sauted, not fried. 
Butter is usually employed for this purpose, but is the poorest 
of all frying materials, as it decomposes at a very low tempera- 
ture. Oil is more wholesome. 

LARDING 

By this we mean stitching a piece of meat with strips of fat 
salt pork. These strips are called "lardoons," and are usually 
two inches in length and an eighth of an inch in width. The 
"needle" used for the purpose is called a larding needle; 
instead of having an eye at the end, it has four slits which fold 
together as it is pulled through the meat. 

Place the strip of fat pork down into the needle, take a stick 
as shown in the cut, pull the needle through the meat leaving a 
portion of the lardoon at each end. We lard sweet breads, 
game, poultry, veal and fillet of beef. It is not, however, at all 
necessary or obligatory that any of these shall be larded, but it 
is the ordinary method. People not using pork simply omit 
that part of the recipe.

SOUPS 



SIMPLE UTENSILS FOR MAKING SOUP 

Perhaps first in importance for the making of good soup are the 
utensils necessary for its preparation. The juices of meat are 
acid ; hence it is undesirable to use either tin or iron ; even after 
a thorough cleaning, they will impart an unpleasant odor, and 
spoil the flavor of the soup for the person with a delicate palate. 
An ordinary granite kettle with a closely fitting lid will 
answer every purpose. If you can afford a little more at first 
cost, the one with an outside copper bottom will last twice as 
long, and is really more desirable. The bottom being double 
prevents the rapid boiling which is always objectionable for 
clear soups. Have the kettle sufficiently large to hold the 
bones, the meat and the water, and leave a space, of at least 
four inches, from the top. This will allow of easy skimming. 
As the ordinary clear soup is made from bone and meat, rapid 
boiling clouds the soup, making a clear soup impossible, without 
clarification ; hence the necessity for great care in making. 

STRAINING 

An ordinary colander may be used for the first straining, and 
after this a puree sieve. 

For a perfectly clear or brilliant soup, a double cheesecloth 
is preferable to a flannel bag. The objection to flannel is that 
it holds the flavor or odor of the soup, and is rarely thoroughly 
cleansed ; then at the next straining, it gives to the soup a stale, 
unpleasant flavor. Cheesecloth is easily cleansed; the fibre of 
cotton is more yielding than that of flannel. 

Use always cold water in making soups. 

As all the nourishment of meat cannot be drawn out into 
the water, the meat from soups should be saved and used for 
such dishes as pressed meats, sandwiches and curries, where 

47 



48 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

added flavorings are pronounced. The water draws out the 
albumin, which coagulates and is removed from the top by 
skimming. It is the coagulation of the albumin throughout the 
hot liquid, as it gradually comes to the surface, that clarifies the 
stock. This nourishment is lost both to the soup and meat, but 
the fibre remains undissolved. The salts or mineral matter have 
been dissolved in the water, taking the flavor and odor from the 
meat ; hence made dishes with decided flavor only are palatable. 



SOUP 

Soups may be divided into four classes : Those containing con- 
siderable nourishment, as thick milk soups; the clear soups 
containing vegetables, moderately nourishing; the thin clear 
soups containing the stimulating elements of the beef, without 
nourishment, as stock, consomme, bouillon; and the cold fruit 
soups. Those of the last class are used only in the summer at 
the beginning of a luncheon, are rather heavy, and cannot be 
considered hygienic. Perfectly clear soups and those con- 
taining bits of vegetables are dinner soups ; while the milk or 
so-called ''cream" soups may be used for luncheon or supper 
where they form a part of the nourishment of the meal. In 
most well-to-do families, soup begins the dinner. As the dishes 
following are rich in food value, the soup need not necessarily 
be nutritious. Under such circumstances, a perfectly clear soup 
is desirable, the object being to draw into the stomach the 
digestive fluids before the entrance of solid food. But where 
a soup is to form the entire dinner, as it frequently does 
among the middle or laboring classes, it must contain sufficient 
meat and vegetable material to give the necessary nourishment. 
In France, among the country folk, the ordinary pot-au-feu is 
always palatable, nutritious and economical, and no one com- 
plains of being hungry immediately after, as is usually the case 
in this country, where "things" are strained out and too often 
thrown away. 

To repeat, water cannot dissolve the fibre of beef, which 
holds a large part of the nourishment. Gear soups are only

made nutritious by the addition of other materials ; in them- 
selves, they have no food value, but are important at the begin- 
ning of a heavy dinner. 

While the fashion of having a dinner soup is confined 
to the fev^, the masses would follow, I am sure, if they knew 
the hygiene of the fashion. 

For clear soup, select either a plain stock, bouillon or con- 
somme. The first may be made from fresh meat, or the bones 
from cooked meats. The latter method is recommended to 
those who wish to live well and economically. 

Bouillon is a light clear soup served in cups at the beginning 
of a luncheon. 

Consomme is the most expensive and the most tasty of all 
clear soups ; it is always used as a dinner soup, 



STOCK 

Stock is the foundation of all the clear soups, and the very life 
and essence of all meat sauces. 

To make a perfectly clear stock use a shin of beef, meat and 
bone in proportion of one pound of meat to a half pound of 
bone. Wipe it carefully with a damp cloth ; cut the meat from 
the bone; and then into small blocks or pieces. Put into the 
stock kettle two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one sliced onion ; 
stir over a hot fire until the onion and sugar brown and burn. 
Throw in the meat, keeping the kettle still quite hot ; shake and 
stir the meat until it seems slightly scorched; then add the 
bones that have been well cracked and five quarts of cold water : 
cover the kettle, bring slowly to boiling point and skim. Push 
the kettle now over a moderate fire where it will just bubble, 
not boil, for three hours. At the end of this time add one onion 
into which you have stuck twelve cloves, a bay leaf, a sliced 
carrot, a few green tops of celery or a half teaspoonful of celery 
seed, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cover and simmer gently 
for another hour. These vegetables may be saved and used for 
puree. A wire vegetable ball is a convenience. Now strain the 
stock and stand it aside to cool. When cold remove every 



60 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

particle of fat from the surface, and it is ready for use. If 
carefully made this will be clear, brown, transparent, and when 
cold a thick jelly. The meat that is strained from the stock 
must not be thrown away, but put aside for the making of 
pressed meats or curries, 

STOCK FOR CONSOMME 

This is, as a rule, of rather better flavor than stock made 
entirely from beef. Purchase a shin of beef and a shin of veal, 
or what the butchers call a "knuckle of veal." Wipe both care- 
fully with a damp cloth. Have them well cracked ; remove the 
meat from the bone, and cut it into blocks. Put two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a sliced onion into the soup kettle to 
brown and burn ; then add the meat from the veal and beef. 
When this is carefully seared, add the bones and six quarts of 
cold water. Finish the same as in the preceding recipe. 



STOCK FROM BEEF AND CHICKEN 

This, perhaps, is one of the most delicate of all stocks. Pur- 
chase a fowl that can be used as a boiled fowl for dinner. Draw 
and truss. Put the sugar and onion into the kettle as directed 
in preceding recipes. Cut the meat from the shin of beef into 
blocks ; put it into the kettle until seared ; then add the bones. 
Now arrange the chicken so that it will rest, as it were, on these 
bones. Add five quarts of cold water. Bring to boiling point 
and skim. Simmer gently until the chicken is tender, and then 
take it out for use. Continue cooking the stock for at least 
three hours ; season and finish as in stock recipe. 



WHITE STOCK 

This term is given to stock made from veal and chicken alone. 
Where one has a roasted breast of veal, the bones may be used 
with the carcass of chickens for white stock, for milk soups and 
sauces. Or you may purchase a fowl and a knuckle of veal.

SOUPS 51 

This, however, would be an extravagant method, and only 
necessary in large establishments with large families. 

All meats used in soup may be made over into such dishes 
as curries and pressed meats. 



STOCK FROM BONES 

The economical housewife saves every bone left from the centre 
of steaks, the bones from roasts, the carcasses of poultry and 
the liquid in which they have been boiled, for the usual house- 
hold stock for everyday soups. These bones may be placed in 
the refrigerator from day to day until the allotted time for 
cooking. They must be cracked, placed in the soup kettle, 
covered with cold water and simmered gently for four hours. 
At the first boil, skim. At the end of the third hour, add the 
flavorings the same as in plain stock. 

The delicate flavor of each vegetable depends upon the 
volatile materials they contain. This, of course, is easily dis- 
sipated if the stock is boiled hard or long after they are added ; 
hence the desirability of adding them just one hour before the 
stock is strained. If they are put in at the beginning of the 
four hours, the bitter rather than the pleasant flavor is 
extracted, and the soup will not be agreeable. 

Select ironing or baking days for the making of stock, when 
one is obliged to have long fires for other work ; in this way 
both fuel and time are saved. 

Stock made from the left-over meats or bones is not, as a 
rule, as clear as that made from fresh meats. When wanted 
perfectly clear, it must be clarified. 

To clarify remove the fat from the surface ; turn the stock 
carefully into the soup kettle, allowing the sediment to remain 
in the bottom of the bowl. Beat the whites of two eggs with 
the washed shells and a half cup of cold water. Add this to the 
cold soup ; mix carefully ; bring to boiling point, and add a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice. Boil hard for five minutes. Let 
stand a moment to settle ; strain carefully through two or three 
thicknesses of cheesecloth wrung from cold water. 



52 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

The albumin In the white of egg acts mechanically, entang- 
ling the floating particles in a sort of fine membrane which is 
formed by the boiling, and leaves the soup perfectly clear. 

Stock may be kept in warm weather, under favorable cir- 
cumstances, for four or five days ; in winter, for ten or twelve 
days. The first thing necessary to the preservation of stock 
is the removal of the fat. Second, it must be cooled quickly 
after it is strained. In summer, it will keep much longer if the 
vegetable flavorings are omitted ; add salt and pepper only. 



BOUILLON 

4 pounds of lean beef i tablespoonful of sugar 

3 quarts of cold water 2 bay leaves 

3/2 teaspoonful of celery seed or i tablespoonful of chopped onion 

a few tops of celery i tablespoonful chopped carrot 

2 whole cloves i blade of mace 

Grating of nutmeg Whites of 2 eggs and the crushed 
I teaspoonful of salt shells 

A dash of cayenne 

Bouillon is a clear soup made from lean beef without bone. 
It perhaps has less flavor than consomme, but is in many cases 
preferable. It is not a dinner soup ; but is, as a rule, served in 
cups for luncheons and suppers. 

Chop fine the beef, after having removed all visible fat. 
Put the sugar into the soup kettle; brown and burn, then 
throw in the meat and add quickly the cold water. Stir the 
meat and the water until the meat is reduced to a sort of pulp. 
Push the kettle over the fire; bring to boiling point. Do not 
skim, but push the kettle back where the bouillon will simmer 
gently for three hours, keeping the kettle closely covered. At 
the end of this time, add the bay leaves, celery seed or a few 
tops of celery, chopped onion, carrot, cloves, mace and grating 
of nutmeg; simmer gently for thirty minutes, and strain. Add 
to the bouillon the whites of the eggs, that have been slightly 
beaten, with the crushed shells. Mix well together, bring 
quickly to boiling point, boil five minutes, and strain through

two thicknesses of cheesecloth. Stand aside to cool. When 
cold remove the globules of fat from the surface. 

Season with a half teaspoon ful of salt, a dash of red pepper 
and a few drops of kitchen bouquet to each quart of bouillon. 

CHICKEN BOUILLON 

1 fowl I teaspoonful of sugar 

2 quarts of cold water Yz teaspoonful of celery seed 
I blade of mace or a few celery tops 

I teaspoonful of salt i saltspoonful of pepper 

Procure a nice fowl ; draw, wash and dry quickly and carefully. 
Cut it into pieces, removing all the flesh from the bones. Put 
the flesh through the meat chopper. Put the sugar into the 
soup kettle, and when it is browned and burned throw in the 
chicken meat. Stir this around for a moment; then add the 
cold water and the bones. Cover the kettle; bring to boiling 
point and skim. Simmer gently for two hours. At the end 
of that time add the celery tops or celery seed, the mace, a bay 
leaf, and if you have it, a clove of garlic ; if not, add simply a 
slice of onion. Simmer gently for thirty minutes and strain. 
This may be clarified the same as in preceding recipe, and 
served in cups for lunch. Season with salt and pepper. If care- 
fully made, it is one of the daintiest of all clear soups. 

CONSOMME a la COLBERT 

While the stock or consomme is being heated for dinner, care- 
fully poach a sufficient number of eggs to allow one to each 
person. When the consomme is hot and nicely seasoned, turn 
it into the tureen and drop in carefully the eggs ; send at once 
to the table. 

CONSOMME WITH MACARONI 

Boil the macaroni first in clear water for thirty minutes ; cut it 
into pieces, add it to hot consomme or stock. Any starchy or 
vegetable matter boiled in consomme or stock will cloud it. 

Spaghetti or any of the Italian pastes may be used in the 
same way, first having been boiled in water until soft.

For this use, if possible, tomato conserve. If one is, however, 
obliged to use canned tomatoes, take the thickest or best portion 
of the tomatoes ; press through a sieve and then cook slowly 
to a thick paste. Take a half cup of this paste, add just a 
suspicion of ground mace, a quarter of a saltspoonful, salt 
and tobasco. Stir in the whites of two eggs slightly beaten. 
Pour into a pie dish, stand in a pan of water and cook in the

pan with the water and onion ; cover and cook slowly for twenty 
minutes ; add the milk. Rub the butter and flour together ; add 
a little of the milk, making a smooth paste ; then turn the whole 
into the kettle; stir constantly until it just reaches the boiling 
point ; add the salt and pepper, and serve at once with oyster 
crackers. A small bit of salt codfish boiled with the salsify 
greatly improves the flavor. 



SOUPS TROM WHITE STOCK 

The white stock, so frequently referred to in cookery books, is 
made from veal or chicken alone, or a mixture of veal and 
chicken. This stock is never used alone as a foundation for 
soup, but is substituted for water in the making of cream soups. 
For instance, instead of covering celery with water to cook for 
a cream soup, cover it with white stock, which, being rich in 



78 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

gelatin, gives body to the soups. One rarely ever has to buy 
material for white stock ; the skeletons of chickens and turkeys 
may be cracked, and covered with cold water, simmered gently 
for two hours, strained and put aside. If fresh material, how- 
ever, is considered preferable, a knuckle of veal is best. These 
sell in the markets at ten to twenty-five cents, according to the 
locality. One knuckle, well cracked, will make two quarts of 
stock, three quarts of water being added at first. Veal stock is, 
as a rule, used for the foundation of pepper-pot ; chicken stock 
is, however, much better. 

Wipe the knuckle carefully; remove the meat from the 
bone. Put the bone into the kettle and the meat on top ; cover 
with three quarts of cold water; bring to boiling point, and 
skim. Push back where it will simmer gently for two hours; 
then add a bay leaf, a small carrot sliced, one onion with twelve 
cloves stuck into it, a sprig of parsley, a teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of pepper; simmer one hour longer; strain and 
stand aside to cool. When cold, remove the fat from the sur- 
face, turn out the soup (which is now a solid jelly) and remove 
all the sediment from the bottom. The stock may be placed 
aside to be used when needed.

gently for two hours. Lift out the meat carefully, and stand it 
aside to cool ; add the bread, onion (sliced) and carrot (whole), 
and all the other seasonings. Cover the kettle, and simmer for 
one hour. Strain the soup ; remove the carrot and put it aside ; 
you will not need it for this dish. Press the bread and onion 
through a fine sieve, re-heat and add the milk and butter. This 
is one of the nicest of all the thick soups. The veal that has 
been taken from the stock may be used for curry of veal, 
boudins or pressed veal. 

SORREL SOUP 

I pint of sorrel i quart of white stock 

I tablespoonful of butter i tablespoonful of cornstarch 

I small onion or arrow-root

Wash the sorrel carefully ; throw it into a hot kettle ; stir over 
the fire until it is thoroughly wilted ; drain, and chop fine ; then 
press it through a sieve. Put into the soup kettle the butter, 
and add the onion sliced. Push it to the back part of the 
stove where the onion will soften without browning. Add 
the sorrel and stock ; bring to boiling point, and simmer gently 
for twenty minutes. Add the cornstarch or arrow-root moist- 
ened in about four tablespoonfuls of milk ; cook until smooth ; 
add the salt and pepper, and pour while hot into the tureen over 
the well beaten yolk of the egg.

so MRS. rorer's new cook book 

been pared and grated ; stir until it reaches the boiling point ; 
draw to the back part of the stove, and simmer for ten minutes. 
This soup will have much the same consistency as gumbo; it 
should be as thick as ordinary puree, and served with croutons.

halves ; wash it thoroughly through several cold waters ; then 
with a sharp knife remove the skin from the head. Singe the 
ears thoroughly ; scald until it is thoroughly blanched. Put the 
head into the soup kettle ; add the heart and liver that have been 
thoroughly washed ; cover with the cold water ; bring to boil- 
ing point and skim. Now add the skin ; cover the kettle and 
simmer gently three hours ; add all the seasoning, sticking the 
cloves into the onions. Simmer one hour longer ; strain. Cut 
the skin into squares of about a half inch. Put the butter into 
another saucepan ; add the flour ; mix carefully and add the 
soup. When this has reached boiling point, add the mushroom 
catsup, the Worcestershire sauce, the kitchen bouquet, and salt ; 
then add the skin and bring slowly to boiling point. Cut the 
egg into slices ; put it into the tureen with the lemon, cut into 
thin slices and then into quarters, add the wine. Pour over the 
soup, and serve. 

The tongue, heart, liver and meat of the head will be saved 
for other dishes. 



SOUPS 81 

A GROUP OF CHICKEN SOUPS 

It seems a great extravagance to boil a chicken for soup; 
better select a fowl of a year and a half or two years, truss 
it neatly, and serve it as boiled fowl with rice for dinner, 
save the water in which it was boiled to use for noodle or rice 
soup next day. In boiling meat, we use boiling water. In 
making soup, we invariably use cold water; here a weaker 
soup will result, because the chicken must be covered with 
boiling water to retain the flavor and make it palatable; 
but we have the addition of starchy food. After the chicken 
is trussed, put it into the soup kettle; cover with boiling 
water; bring to boiling point; push it to the back part of the 
stove to simmer for an hour and a half. Add an onion, a bay 
leaf, a saltspoonful of celery seed, a teaspoonful of salt and a 
saltspoonful of pepper. When the chicken is done, remove it, 
and allow the stock to simmer until it is reduced one-third. 
After the chicken has been served, crack the carcass ; put it 
back into the kettle and cook it another hour. Strain and stand 
it aside. To make noodle soup, cook in this broth two ounces 
of noodle; rice soup, four tablespoon fuls of rice. 

SOUP k la REINE 

I 3>^ pound chicken 3 quarts of cold water 

3/2 pint of cream 4 ounces of bread freed from 

3/2 teaspoonful of celery seed crust 

I medium sized onion A bay leaf 

I tablespoonful of butter i small carrot 

I teaspoonful of salt i tablespoonful of flour 
I saltspoonful of pepper 

This is one of the most elegant of all the thick soups. Clean and 
truss the chicken ; put it into the soup kettle with the water ; 
bring to boiling point and skim. Simmer gently until the 
chicken is perfectly tender, about two and a half hours. Then 
remove the chicken, and boil the stock rapidly for thirty min- 
utes. Add the bread, onion, carrot, bay leaf, celery, salt and 
pepper ; simmer gently for thirty minutes longer ; press through 
a colander, then through a fine sieve, rejecting the carrot. 



OZ MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 

Return this to the soup kettle. Chop the white meat of the 
chicken very fine ; then rub or pound it to a paste ; add a Httle 
of the soup until it is perfectly smooth ; add the whole to the 
soup, and press again through a fine sieve. Rub the butter and 
flour together ; add them to the soup ; stir constantly until boil- 
ing, add the cream, and, when very hot, serve. 

ENGLISH CHICKEN SOUP 

The dark meat and carcass of i tablespoonful of grated onion

I saltspoonful of pepper 

This soup is usually made from the "remnants" of chicken. 
Cut the dark meat of chicken into blocks, rejecting the skin and 
fat. Crack the bones, put them into a kettle; cover with two 
quarts of cold water; add the bay leaf and pepper, bring to 
boiling point, and simmer gently for one hour. Strain, put in 
back over the fire, and boil rapidly for thirty minutes or until 
reduced to a quart ; now add the onion juice, bay leaf, the color- 
ing, the salt, and chicken blocks. When thoroughly hot, serve. 
This soup should be perfectly clear, and of an amber color. 

RICE PUREE 

This is made precisely the same as soup a la reine, substituting 
a half cup of rice for the given amount of bread. It may, also, 
be made without the white meat.

into a kettle; cover with cold water, and bring to boiling 
point. Simmer gently for two hours, strain and stand aside. 
About an hour before the soup is to be served, boil the peas until 
tender ; drain and press through a colander ; add to them a tea- 
spoonful of grated onion, a saltspoonful of salt, just a dash of 
pepper and two tablespoonfuls of white smooth bread crumbs. 
Break in one whole egg; mix thoroughly, and make into tiny 
balls ; drop them into the hot soup ; add the lettuce shredded ; 
cover and stand where it will almost boil, for ten minutes. Add 
salt, and serve at once. 



GIBLET SOUP

I teaspoonful of grated onion i saltspoonful of pepper 

Save the giblets from a pair of chickens with the rougher pieces 
like the neck and tips of the wings. Scald and skin the feet ; 
crack them into several pieces. Put all into a soup kettle ; cover 
with two quarts of cold water and simmer gently for two 
hours; then add the salt and pepper. Strain the soup and 
remove the giblets ; cut them into neat pieces ; return them to 
the soup; add a teaspoonful of grated onion juice, and the 
kitchen bouquet. Cut the eggs and lemon into thin slices, put 
them into the tureen ; pour over the soup, and sei^e at once. 
Bay leaf and celery may be added to the stock, if desired. 



GUMBOS OF OKR.A AND FILEE 

Under this heading, we give one of the most delightful of all 
soups. The filee powder is made from the tiny leaves of the 
sassafras — the first that comes out in the spring. Dry quickly, 
powder and press through a sieve. Being rich in mucilage, 
it adds to the thickening as well as the flavor of the soup. 
A gumbo is really not a true gumbo unless it contains filee 



84 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

powder. These soups also contain okra, another vegetable 
rich in mucilage, giving them distinct characteristics of their 
own. They may be made from ordinary chicken or white stock, 
or use turkey or game as a foundation. A half pint of cold 
roasted chicken with the carcass of the chicken will make 
sufficient gumbo for six persons. Crack the bones of the car- 
cass; put them into the soup kettle with two quarts of cold 
water; bring to boiling point, skim, and push the kettle back 
where it will simmer for about two hours. Chop the meat very, 
very fine, and pound or rub it to a paste. Strain the stock, add 
it gradually to the meat ; put back over the fire ; add a pint of 
okra that has been washed and cut into rings, and two peeled 
tomatoes that have been cut into halves and the seeds pressed 
out. Cook for one hour. Add a tablespoonful of iilee, a level 
teaspoonful of salt, a half cup of green corn that has been 
scored and pressed from the cob, and a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Boil five minutes, and serve with plain boiled rice in a separate 
dish. 



CHICKEN GUMBO WITH OYSTERS 

I young chicken i quart of green okra 

1 good-sized tomato 25 oysters 

A bay leaf i teaspoonful of salt 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter i saltspoonful of pepper 

Draw the chicken, and cut it up as for a fricassee. Put into the 
soup kettle the two tablespoonfuls of butter; when hot (not 
brown) throw in the chicken and shake until the chicken is 
browned. Draw to one side, and add the okra that has been 
washed and cut into slices. Cook slowly with the chicken and 
butter over a mild fire for ten or fifteen minutes; then add 
two quarts of boiling water, the tomato cut into slices, and the 
bay leaf; bring to boiling point, and simmer gently for one 
hour or until reduced to a quart and a pint; now add the 
oysters, salt and pepper ; bring to boiling point, and serve with 
carefully boiled rice. The rice is usually passed, allowing each 
one to put a spoonful into the gumbo. 



SOUPS B6 

MUTTON SOUPS 

The soups of this group are usually made with barley, and are 
known in many cookery books as Scotch broths. For the stock, 
select the necks of mutton, as they contain a large amount of 
albumin, have about the right proportion of bone and meat, and 
are economical. 

SCOTCH MUTTON BROTH 

Purchase a neck of mutton, wash it well in cold w^ater, and cut 
it into bits. Put it into the soup kettle with two quarts of cold 
water, bring to boiling point, and skim; simmer for one and a 
half hours. Add an onion, turnip, celery, carrot, bay leaf and 
pepper ; cover and simmer one hour longer ; strain and add salt 
and pepper. 

BARLEY BROTH 

Add to the preceding recipe, after the broth has been skimmed, 
four tablespoonfuls of washed pearl barley, and finish as 
directed. 

MUTTON BROTH WITH RICE 

Strain plain mutton broth ; add to it six tablespoonfuls of rice : 
boil for thirty minutes and serve. 

SCOTCH LEEK SOUP 

Strain two quarts of mutton broth ; add to it twelve nice leeks 
chopped fine, white and green together, and a half pint of rolled 
oats ; simmer for one hour ; press the whole through a fine sieve ; 
return it to the fire ; add a palatable seasoning of salt, and pour 
it into the tureen over the well-beaten whites of two eggs. 

COCKIELEEKIE

Yi. pound of prunes 2 bay leaves 

Yolks of two eggs i teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Purchase the marrow bone from the round ; have the butcher 



86 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

saw it into two-inch lengths, making four bones. Draw and 
truss the fowl ; put it into a soup kettle ; cover with cold water, 
bring to boiling point and skim. Add the marrow bones, the 
bay leaf and pepper; simmer gently for one hour. Add the 
leeks, neatly trimmed; simmer one hour longer. Add the 
prunes which have been soaked in water over night, and the 
salt; bring again to boiling point, and it is ready to serve. 
Remove the strings from the chicken, dish it in the centre of a 
large platter, put the prunes around, garnish the edge of the 
dish with carefully boiled rice, the marrow bones, and the leeks. 
Strain the soup into a tureen over the well beaten yolks of the 
eggs, and serve with squares of toasted bread. Serve tgg sauce 
with the chicken. This dish takes the place of both meat 
and soup. 

FISH SOUPS 

BOUILLABAISSE 

1 gill of sweet oil i tablespoonful of chopped 

2 cloves of garlic parsley 

13^ pounds of halibut i>4 pounds of haddock 

A bay leaf i dozen clams or oysters 

2 thin slices of lemon 2 cloves 

1 lobster or a half dozen i tomato 

crawfish i teaspoonful of salt 

2 medium sized onions i saltspoonful of pepper 

Put the oil into a kettle, add the onions, chopped fine, and the 
garlic, mashed. Shake until a golden brown; add the fish, 
washed and cut into slices, the bay leaf, clove, lemon, tomato 
— peeled, cut into halves with seeds pressed out — and the salt 
and pepper. Cover the kettle, and cook slowly for twenty 
minutes, add a quart of boiling water, bring to a boil and skim. 
Add the oysters and chopped parsley. Have ready boiled and 
hot the lobster, break oflf the claws, crack and take out the meat 
in one piece. Remove the tail meat and cut it into two long 
pieces. Dish the fish neatly on a platter, putting the oysters 
around the edge; place the lobster on top in the centre and 
sprinkle over a little chopped parsley. Add to the soup in the 



SOUPS 



87 



kettle a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet and pour it over six 
large croutons in a deep dish. To make the croutons, cut 
slices of bread one inch thick, remove the crusts and toast the 
bread in the oven until crisp to the centre and brown ; stand 
them in the dish, one overlapping the other. To serve, put in 
the soup plate first a crouton, then a piece of fish and one of 
lobster, some oysters, then a ladleful of soup. This is eaten 
with a spoon and takes the place of both soup and fish. 

COURT BOUILLON 

I tablespoonful of sugar i onion 

4 pounds of fish 3 quarts of cold water 

I bay leaf i tablespoonful of chopped 

I saltspoonful of celery seed or parsley 

a few celery tops i small carrot 

I teaspoonful of salt i turnip 

2 saltspoonfuls of pepper 
Wash the fish ; clean and cut it into slices, using both head and 
tail. Put the sugar into the soup kettle, add the sliced onion, 
and stir until the onion is burned ; then add the cold water, and 
put in the fish; add all the seasoning except the salt; bring to 
boiling point, skim and simmer gently for two hours ; add the 
salt; strain, and stand aside to cool. There is rarely ever any 
fat to take from the surface, hence it may be strained and used 
at once. This stock will not keep like that made from beef. 
It may be served plain or with croutons, or it may have added 
at the last moment before serving, a few boiled shrimps, a few 
bits of lobster, or crabs, or oysters. 

CREAM OF FISH SOUP 

The following recipe will answer for all kinds of fish ; for 
instance, if one wants a halibut soup, buy the given quantity 
of halibut ; for salmon soup, the given quantity of salmon, and 
so on, using exactly the same proportions. 

1 pound of fish i quart of milk 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour i small onion 
I tablespoonful of butter i bay leaf 

A sprig of parsley Salt and pepper to taste 

Wash the fish ; put it into a saucepan ; add the bay leaf, parsley 



88 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

and onion. Cover with a pint of cxdIcI water ; bring quickly to 
boiling point; skim, and simmer fifteen minutes; strain. 
Take the fish carefully from the colander ; remove the skin and 
bone, and mash with the back of a spoon, adding, gradually, 
the water. Put the milk over the fire in a double boiler. Rub 
the butter and flour together ; add a little of the hot milk ; when 
smooth, turn it into the double boiler, and cook until you have 
a smooth, creamHke mixture. To this add gradually the fish ; 
add the salt and pepper, and when thoroughly heated, serve. 

CLAM BOUILLON 

25 clams I quart of water

Scrub the shells of the clams and rinse them well. Put them 
into a soup kettle with the water ; bring quickly to the boiling 
point; take from the fire; remove each clam from the shell, 
being careful to save the liquor as you take them out. Chop the 
clams ; return them to the kettle ; add the bay leaf, celery and 
onion. Cover and simmer gently for thirty minutes ; skim and 
strain. Re-heat ; add the butter and it is ready to serve. A pint 
of milk may be added, if desired. The mixture cannot be boiled 
after the milk is added or it will curdle. 

CLAM SOUP 

50 clams 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 

I quart of water ^ dozen Bent's crackers, rolled 

I saltspoonful of pepper or 2 tablespoonfuls of flour 

I pint of milk 

Drain the clams. Put the liquor on to boil. Chop the clams 
and add them. Simmer fifteen minutes ; skim ; add the water, 
and simmer five minutes longer. If you add crackers, roll and 
add them now with the milk. If you use flour, rub the butter 
and flour together and stir it carefully into the mixture. Bring 
to boiling point ; add the milk ; take from the fire and serve at 
once. 

If this is strained, it may be served in cups under the name 
of clam bisque.

25 oysters i quart of water 

y2 tablespoonful of butter i saltspoonful of celery seed, or 
I saltspoonful of pepper one head of celery, chopped 

Wash the oysters ; drain them in a colander ; throw them into 
a very hot kettle over the fire ; shake, and when the oysters have 
partly seared, drain them, saving the liquor. Chop the oysters ; 
return them to the liquor; put into a double boiler; add the 
water, the celery seed, or celery and pepper, and cook slowly 
thirty minutes. Strain ; add the salt, and serve at once. 

OYSTER SOUP 

50 oysters ^ i pint of water 

I quart of milk i dozen whole pepper corns 

I tablespoonful of butter i level teaspoonful of salt 

I tablespoonful of flour i saltspoonful of pepper 

Put the oysters into a colander to drain; then pour over a 
pitcher of cold water; throw them into a hot kettle; add the 
pepper corns ; shake for a moment ; cover the kettle and stand 
on the back part of the stove for ten minutes. Now add the 
water. Rub the butter and flour together; add a little of the 
soup to make a smooth paste; add this and the milk, and stir 
constantly until it almost reaches the boiling point and is slightly 
thickened ; add the salt and pepper, and it is ready to serve. 

Caution. — Do not allow the mixture to boil, as it destroys 
the flavor and tenderness of the oysters and curdles the soup; 
be careful, however, that the oysters are thoroughly heated. 

BISQUE OF LOBSTER 

I good-sized hen lobster i tablespoonful of butter 

(about 3 pounds) 4 ounces of bread

Wash the lobster in cold water, and plunge it into water nearly 
boiling hot ; boil for twenty minutes, take out, throw the water 
away, add two quarts of fresh boiling water and boil gently for 



90 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

three-quarters of an hour. Remove the lobster, saving the 
Hquor in which it was boiled. Twist off the small claws; 
smash, and throw them back into the stock. Remove the meat 
from the tail ; smash the tail shell, and put it back into the stock. 
Take the meat from the body, putting the green fat or liver by 
itself and also the coral. Melt the butter ; take the small pieces 
of lobster meat, and pound them in a mortar, adding gradually 
the butter. Strain the lobster liquor, add it gradually to this 
pounded mixture; then add the bread that has been dried and 
toasted. Boil five minutes; press through a colander; return 
to the kettle over the fire, boil gently for five minutes; 
add the coral that has been rubbed to a paste with the fat or 
"liver" of the lobster, also a portion of the lobster meat cut into 
blocks ; add the salt, pepper and mace, and serve. The meat 
from the claws and the tail being the better portions, may be 
used for salad or a la Newburg and the meat from the body only 
pounded up for the bisque of lobster. Serve with large 
croutons, one being placed in each soup plate, and the bisque 
ladled over. 

BISQUE OF LOBSTER a la COLBERT 

This is made precisely the same as in the preceding recipe, a 
poached €:gg for each person being added at the last moment ; 
croutons are omitted. 



BISQUE OF CRABS 

Make exactly the same as bisque of lobster, using six good- 
sized crabs. 

One pint of Crawfish or Shrimps may be used in the same 
manner. 

GREEN TURTLE SOUP 

The day before you intend to use the soup, kill a ten pound 
turtle by cutting off the head with a very sharp knife. Hang 
the turtle up by the tail that it may properly bleed. Separate 
the upper from the lower shell, being careful not to cut the 
gall bladder. Cut the meat from the breast in slices; remove 



SOUPS 



91 



the gall and the entrails and throw them away. Separate 
the fins as near the shell as possible, and abstract the green fat, 
which save with the white meat in a separate dish. Put the 
upper and lower shells in a large kettle ; put over sufficient cold 
water to cover ( four quarts ) ; simmer gently until you can easily 
remove the bones. Scrape all the gelatin adhering to the shell, 
and save it in a separate dish. Put into a soup kettle the head, 
fins, liver, lights, heart and all the flesh, a quarter of a pound of 
lean ham, ten whole cloves, two bay leaves, a bunch of pot- 
herbs, an onion sliced and two tablespoonfuls of parsley. Cover 
with the liquor in which the shells were boiled, and simmer 
gently until the meat is thoroughly done. Strain the mixture 
through a fine sieve ; stand it on the side of the stove while you 
cut the meat into squares of one inch. Put into a separate sauce- 
pan four ounces of butter; add an onion, chopped fine; cook 
until tender; then add one pint of Madeira; and bring slowly 
to simmering point. Now add four tablespoonfuls of browned 
flour, and the liquor that has been strained from the other 
materials ; skim ; then add the fat, the gelatin and the 
meat and a dozen hard boiled eggs, chopped fine. At serving 
time add the juice of a dozen green limes and a teaspoonful of 
cayenne. Warm gently, add wine and serve. 



SNAPPER SOUP 

Secure one good-sized snapper, which kill precisely the same 
as the green turtle. It must be killed the day before it is 
to be cooked. After the snapper has been thoroughly bled, 
wash it well in cold water; throw it into boiling water, boil 
fifteen minutes. Take it from the water, separate the upper 
and under shells carefully, keeping your knife close to the 
shell, and remove the meat entire. Open carefully, remove the 
bladder and intestines. Cut the gall carefully from the liver. 
Break the shell, put it in the bottom of the soup kettle, place 
on top the meat, cover with two quarts of boiling water; add 
two bay leaves, one onion sliced, four cloves, a few whole pep- 
percorns, or a saltspoonful of white pepper. Cover and simmer 
gently for one and a half hours, or until the meat is tender. 



92 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Remove the nicest pieces of the meat, and put them aside for 
stewed snapper. Cut the remaining meat into dice, using one- 
half of the Hver. Strain the soup. Rub together one table- 
spoonful of butter, and one of flour; add the soup; stir until 
boiling and add a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, a drop of 
tobasco and a level teaspoonful of salt, and the meat. Cut into 
slices two hard boiled eggs and half of a lemon. Put these 
into the tureen with six tablespoonfuls of Madeira or sherry ; 
pour over the soup and serve.

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Cut the bacon into very thin slices ; put it into the bottom of a 
good-sized saucepan. Pare and cut the potatoes into dice. 
Chop the clams, and roll the crackers. Put a layer of potatoes on 
top of the bacon ; then a sprinkling of onion, thyme, sweet mar- 
joram, parsley, salt and the tomatoes chopped ; then a layer of 
the chopped clams ; and continue the alternations until all of the 
materials have been used. Add the stock, which should barely 
cover the whole. Cover the saucepan ; place it over a very slow

ANALYSIS

For table of fish in season see page 27 

Fish belongs to the nitrogenous group of foods. 

Builds and repairs muscular flesh and tissues. 

Is digested principally in the stomach, proper. 

The chemical analysis of fish has not been sufficiently 
accurate to make a table of composition at all reliable. The 
albuminoid matter in white fish, as cod, haddock and halibut, is 
in about the same proportion as in beef and mutton. The ratio 
of water in fish, flesh and fowl is also quite uniform ; fish con- 
tain, however, more phosphorus, the active fish, as trout and 
pickerel, containing the greater percentage. The amount of 
carbon depends largely upon the amount of fat the fish contain. 
White fleshed fish are, therefore, deficient in carbon. The fat 
is secreted and held in the liver. If you should ask an intelli- 
gent cook what vegetables to serve with boiled white fish, she 
would answer, potatoes and cucumbers or lettuce with French 
dressing, as they supply the wanting carbohydrates and fat. 
Pink fleshed fish, as salmon, catfish and sturgeon, have the fat 
dispersed throughout the body, and are in consequence more 
difficult of digestion, although alone they have a greater food 
value. From this we learn that the white fleshed fish are better 
for the delicate stomach, and that the dark or pink fish make a 
much better diet for the active man ; and the more active fish 
will contain a greater amount of muscle-making food than their 
jnore indolent relations. Fish, on account of its densitv of fibre,

would not be recommended as a frequent diet for brain workers. 
In foreign countries fish are caught in nets, kept alive in 
tanks of fresh water, weighed after they are purchased, and 
then killed. Under such circumstances fish are much more 
wholesome. Stale fish should be avoided, those kept in cold 
storage, as well as those frozen in blocks of ice. Better, by 
far, accept the fish that are in season during the different 
months of the year than to use one special sort, the year around. 

TO PURCHASE FISH 

Examine the flesh, which should be firm, the scales closely 
adhering and. of brilliant color, the eyes and gills bright and the 
flesh free from any unpleasant odor. Fish are poisonous if 
stale. 

WHITE FLESHED FISH 

Heading this list stands cod, which being widely distributed 
along the northern coast, is easily accessible, hence its cheapness. 
The tongues, and sounds, the swimming bladders, are fre- 
quently used as a special disli. 

Isinglass is a gelatin or glue made from these swimming or 
air bladders. Cod liver oil is expressed from the cod's liver. 

Cod is an admirable boiling fish, and may be fried in slices 
or fillets, but is never used for baking. 

Haddock, closely allied to the cod, is less desirable on 
account of the enormous weight of the head, which is waste; 
and while it sells at a low price, is not always cheap. Both cod 
and haddock are to be had throughout the year, but are truly 
in season from October to June. 

Halibut is the largest fish coming to our market. Young 
halibut weighing from ten to fifteen pounds are sold whole 
under the name of ^'chicken halibut ;" the larger halibut are cut 
into slices and sold at twenty-five cents per pound ; being solid 
flesh, without waste, is economical. 

Flounders, admirable boiling fish, are flat, a little larger 
than the English sole, and are frequently served for the same. 
They have, however, coarser flesh, and are not so fine in flavor. 
These may be also made into fillets and fried, or served au 
gratin.

FISH

Perhaps next in order comes the white fish of the great 
lakes, one of our very best fish when used fresh from the water ; 
and when planked are much better and much more delicate than 
shad. They are also an exceedingly good boiling, baking or 
broiling fish. 

Along the coasts we have endless varieties of good fish, 
blue fish, sheep's-head, weak fish, sea bass, porgies. All these 
may be planked, broiled, or boiled. Blue fish are exceedingly 
good when baked. 

As we go South on the coast, we find the red snapper, and 
along the Gulf, the pompano. This, without exception, is the 
king of all fish. When properly boiled it is free from the gen- 
eral odor and flavor of fish, tastes more like the most delicious 
young chicken. Red snapper is also a fine boiling fish, but too 
large for a small family. 

Spanish mackerel are best broiled. They are found also in 
the Southern waters, and command a much higher price than 
the ordinary blue, smooth skinned mackerel; the latter are 
usually salted. 

Mackerel are in season during the summer months, the best 
usually coming in from about the first to the middle of June. 
They keep in good condition until the first of September. 

Shad come from the sea up into the fresh water rivers for 
spawning early in the spring. Our first shad come from the 
southern waters in February or March ; next from up the Sus- 
quehanna and Delaware. They are in season from the first of 
February until the middle of June. They are best planked ; are 
very good, however, broiled, but should never be fried, as they 
already contain too much fat. Frying makes them more diffi- 
cult of digestion. 

Bony fish, as herring and porgies, are usually rolled in egg 
and bread crumbs and fried. They are cheap, but very full of 
bones. Boneless salted herring makes an exceedingly nice 
relish for the beginning of a lunch. 

Eels and catfish, fish without scales, must be taken from 
exceedingly clean water to be wholesome. They are skinned, 
dipped in egg and bread crumbs, and fried. 

Salmon, the most prized of all, is one of the pink fleshed 



98 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

fish, of fine flavor. It may be sliced and broiled, or planked; 
boiled whole or in slices, and served with sauce Hollandaise, 
is the most elegant of dinner fish. 

Cod's head and shoulders boiled is also a fine dinner dish. 
Next to this comes the rock or rock bass. Salmon, of course, 
is fine; but the white fleshed fish are preferable where heavy 
meats follow. 

BOILED FISH 

Wash well in cold water a nice fresh fish ; wipe carefully, and 
rub with salt ; wrap it in a cloth ; drop it into a long baking pan 
or fish kettle half filled with boiling water ; add a sHce of onion, 
a bay leaf and a teaspoonful of salt; cover and simmer gently 
ten minutes to each pound. Lift carefully, drain and unfasten 
the cloth. Turn the fish over on to the serving platter, garnish 
with parsley and slices of lemon. Serve with boiled fish, plain 
boiled potatoes or potato balls, cucumbers or lettuce with 
French dressing and either shrimp or oyster sauce or sauce 
Hollandaise or plain drawn butter, in a sauceboat. 

Left over cold boiled fish may be made into cutlets, creamed 
fish, deviled fish, salad or croquettes. 

This recipe will answer for the boiling of all kinds of fish. 



BOILED SALMON STEAKS 

Have the steaks cut at least two inches thick and nicely cleaned. 
Wrap each one separately in a piece of cheesecloth. Have ready 
a large fish kettle or baking pan half filled with boiling water, 
to which you have added a slice of onion, a bay leaf, a blade 
of mace and four tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar and a 
teaspoonful of salt. Put the slices in (they must be covered 
with the water) and simmer gently twenty minutes. Lift them 
carefully, one at a time, and dish one slice overlapping the other. 
Garnish with parsley and quarters of lemon, and serve with 
lobster sauce. 

Small Halibut Steaks or small Cod Steaks may be boiled 
after the same fashion.

Cut from the salmon, steaks about one inch thick ; trim them 
nicely, brush them with two tablespoon fuls of butter and one of 
lemon juice that have been thoroughly worked together; put 
each in a heart-shaped piece of paper ; fold over the edges and 
place them in a baking pan. Bake in a quick oven thirty min- 
utes. Serve them in the papers and pass with them sauce 
Hollandaise. 

TO BOIL SALT COD 

Select large white boneless cod; cut it into convenient pieces 
for serving, wash it well in cold water; cover with fresh cold 
water and soak it over night. In the morning drain and cover 
again with fresh cold water. An hour before serving time put 
it into the kettle; pour over it boiling water; bring slowly to 
boiling point. Let it stand below boiling point for ten minutes. 
Lift carefully with a skimmer; dish neatly, and pour over 
English drawn butter, seasoned with lemon, or serve with 
tomato sauce. 



SALT CODFISH CREOLE STYLE 

1 pound of boneless codfish ^ can of tomatoes 
y2 cup of rice i onion 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter 1/2 teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Wash and soak the codfish over night, as in preceding recipe. 
When ready to serve, put the butter and onion in a saucepan ; 
cover and cook on the back part of the stove until the onion is 
soft, not brown. Drain the codfish, add it and the rice which 
has been boiled for twenty minutes ; pour over the tomatoes 
strained ; cover the saucepan, and cook gently twenty minutes. 
When ready to serve add salt and pepper, push the rice aside 
and dish the fish first ; put on top of it the rice, and pour over 
the sauce. This makes an economical and palatable dish for 
lunch. Fresh fish may be substituted for salt cod.

boiling water; boil rapidly for thirty minutes; drain; throw 
into cold water, and blanch for fifteen minutes ; then cut into 
pieces about a half inch long. Wash the codfish ; cut it into 
blocks. It is better to have soaked over night. If you wish to 
use it in a hurry, cover it with cold water; bring to boiling 



102 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

point; drain, throwing away the water, and cover agfain. Do 
this three times, and it will be sufficiently fresh. Rub the butter 
and flour together, add the tomato; stir until boiling, and add 
the macaroni, fish, onion juice, salt and pepper. Mix until boil- 
ing ; stand over the tea kettle or in hot water for thirty minutes, 
and it is ready to serve. 

TO FRY FISH 

Small fish are perhaps more palatable fried than boiled or 
broiled. They may be cooked in almost any sort of fat, as lard 
or a mixture of lard and suet, but are decidedly better when 
fried in oil. Perch, brook trout, catfish and smelts are all 
cooked in precisely the same manner. Wash in cold water; 
clean; wash again and immediately wipe dry inside and out. 
Handle with great care, or the fish will be bruised. Put suffi- 
cient oil into a deep frying pan to cover the fish. Beat an 
egg without separating ; add a tablespoonful of hot water ; dip 
the fish first in the egg, then roll in bread crumbs. Put a few 
at a time into the frying basket and sink them into the hot oil. 
Be sure to test the oil with a crumb of bread ; if it browns in 
thirty seconds, it is sufficiently hot, 360° Fahr. As soon as the 
fish are browned and the outside crisp, lift carefully and drain 
on brown paper. Dish on a folded napkin, garnish with parsley 
and lemon. A very dainty way to fry smelts is to run four on a 
skewer, and dish them according to the diagram. 

TO CLEAN SMELTS 

Make a slight opening at the gills with either a sharp knife or 
a pair of scissors ; then draw the smelt between the thumb and 
finger, from the tail to the head. In this way all the intestines 
will be pressed out at the gill opening. Wash and dry ; sprinkle 
with salt, and they are ready to dip and fry. 

FRIED HALIBUT 

Cut halibut steak into pieces two inches square ; dip in beaten 
egg and roll in bread crumbs ; fry in hot fat. Lay on brown 
paper to drain, and serve plain on a hot dish, or with sauce 
tartare.

For this, use a white fish, rock or black bass. After the fish has 
been scaled and cleaned, put your hand firmly on the fish and 
with a sharp knife cut from the tail to the head just as near the 
bone as possible, removing all the flesh. Turn the fish on the 
other side and do the same thing. In this way you will remove 
all the bones. Cut the fish into strips all the way across, and 
about an inch wide. Roll and fasten with a wooden skewer. 
Have ready a deep pan of hot fat. Put a half dozen of these 
rolls in your frying basket and plunge them into the hot fat ; 
they will quickly curl tighter, and will cook in about three min- 
utes. Drain on brown paper; dust with salt; arrange on a 
napkin ; garnish with parsley and lemon. 



FRICASSEE OF FISH 

For this, purchase one pound of black bass or yellow perch ; 
wash, cut off the head and tail; cut the fish into slices about 
two inches wide. Into a saucepan put two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one chopped onion ; cover and cook until the onion 
is soft. If you like, you may add just a suspicion of garlic. 
Now put in the fish ; cover the saucepan, allowing the fish to 
cook for about ten minutes. Pour over it one pint of strained 
tomatoes ; add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a teaspoonful 
of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cook five minutes more, 
and serve. 

BAKED BLUE FISH 

This recipe will answer for all sorts of fish except carp. Have 
the fish opened at the gills, and the intestines drawn out 
through the opening. Make a stuffing of a half pint of bread 
crumbs, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt 
and a dash of pepper. Mix the ingredients, fill into the fish, 
and sew the head down firmly. If you use pork, cut the fish 
into gashes two inches apart and all the way across on one side 
down to the bone; fill the gashes with larding pork, dust the 
fish thicklv with bread crumbs, baste it over with a little melted 



104 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

butter, put a half cup of water in the pan, and bake in a quick 
oven about one hour, basting frequently. Dish the fish care- 
fully, using a long fish slice ; garnish it with parsley and lemon, 
and serve with brown or tomato sauce. 



BAKED CARP 

Clean the carp as directed in preceding recipe. Wash the flesh 
all over with vinegar. Let it stand for fifteen or twenty min- 
utes. Make a bread stuffing, fill it into the fish, sew the head 
down firmly. Brush the fish all over with egg, and dredge it 
thickly with bread crumbs, and put over it a few lumps of but- 
ter. Place the fish in a granite pan ; add two chopped onions, 
a bunch of parsley and one cup of water mixed with one tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce. If you have anchovy 
sauce, add also a teaspoonful. Bake in a moderate oven for 
one hour, basting frequently. When the fish is done, lift 
it carefully on a serving dish and garnish. Rub together a 
tablespoonful of butter and one of flour ; add the liquor that is 
in the pan with sufficient boiling water to make a half pint; turn 
the whole back into the pan, cook for a moment, strain, add the 
juice of a lemon and a seasoning of salt and pepper, and serve 
in a sauceboat. 

BAKED COD'S HEAD 

Head and portion of the i tablespoonful of chopped 

shoulders of cod parsley 

I teaspoonful of onion juice i teaspoonful of salt 

y2 pound of veal or chicken i saltspoonful of pepper 

Trim and wash the fish. Chop the veal, adding to it the 
salt, pepper, parsley and onion juice; fill this into the fish, put 
into a baking pan, cover with buttered paper, add a half cup of 
water to the pan, and, if you use it, four tablespoonfuls of white 
wine. Run into a moderately hot oven and bake three-quarters 
of an hour, basting frequently. When the head is nearly done, 
remove the paper, baste with melted butter and dust thickly with 
browned bread crumbs. When done, dish, and serve with 
brown sauce in a boat. 



FISH

BROILED FISH 

This recipe will answer for the broiling of all kinds of fish. 
Scale, and split the fish down the back, wash and dry it, dust 
with salt and pepper. Put it on a wire broiler, folding over 
the thin middle portion so as to have the fish of an even 
thickness. Brush the flesh side with butter. Hold it near a 
perfectly clear fire until nicely browned ; then turn, and brown 
the skin side. Then lift the broiler, either with a broiler stand 
or with a couple of bricks, at least six or eight inches from the 
fire, and broil slowly on the flesh side twenty minutes ; then 
turn and broil on the skin side about ten minutes. Be careful 
not to burn. Baste it with butter, and serve at once. 

TO BROIL FISH IN A GAS STOVE 

Prepare the fish precisely the same as in the preceding recipe. 
Put under the flames an ordinary sheet or granite iron baking 
pan, and when very hot, grease it lightly with butter. Put the 
fish in skin side down ; baste it with butter, dust lightly with salt 
and pepper, and put it under the flame in the broiling oven on 
the very bottom of the stove ; when nicely browned, turn down 
the lights as low as possible, and broil slowly for thirty minutes. 
Dish; spread with butter; put over it a little lemon juice, and 
serve at once. 

TO BROIL FISH IN AN OIL STOVE 

Light the oven and allow it to get very hot. Prepare the fish as 
in first recipe. Put a long baking pan over a good strong flame ; 
when hot, put in just a little suet or butter, and drop in the fish 
skin side down ; baste it with butter, dust with salt and pepper, 
place it in the oven, on the upper grate near the top, and cook 
a half hour ; baste once or twice with melted butter, and when 
brown, serve. If the manipulation is right, the fish will be 
almost as good as when broiled over coal or under the gas flame. 
A narrow heavy iron pan, or a narrow long asbestos mat on 
the lower shelf or grate of the oil stove, will drive the heat 
around the sides of the oven, and throw it down on top of the 
fish, and the fish will be browned on top the same as when 
broiled.

FISH a la CREME 

I pound of fish l pint of milk 

I tablespoonful of butter i tablespoonful of flour 

Yolks of two eggs i teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Boil the fish and pick it apart in large flakes. Rub the butter 
and flour together ; add the milk ; stir until boiling. Take from

Stand over hot water until thoroughly heated ; serve in a border 
of potato or rice. This may also be turned into a baking dish, 
covered with bread crumbs and browned quickly in the oven. 

Caution. — If baked too long the egg will separate, giving 
the whole a curdled appearance. 

This may also be served in ramekins or small individual 
dishes. 

Omit the eggs from this recipe, and you will have Plain 
Creamed Fish. 

PLANKED FISH 

For this select white fish or shad, although any white fleshed 
fish is good planked. 

Secure a plank the size of your oven, or one that will fit the 
underneath portion of your gas stove. In a gas stove, fish is 
planked in the broiling chamber. The plank must be at least 
one inch thick, a little wider than the fish, as long as the oven 
and composed of hard wood, as oak, hickory or ash. 

IN FRONT OF A WOOD FIRE 

Put the plank before the fire until very hot. Split the fish down 
the back ; wash and wipe dry ; baste with butter ; dust with salt 
and pepper. Put the fish on the plank, skin side down, folding 
over the thin middle portion, bringing the two halves together. 
Drive two medium sized nails at the head of the fish and one at 
the tail. Rear it up in front of a good, clear, strong wood fire ; 
baste occasionally with melted butter, and cook for at least a 
half hour until the fish is a good dark brown. Serve at once

on the plank; garnish with parsley and lemon. Cucumber or 
lettuce salad and creamed potatoes are the usual accompani- 
ments. 

TO PLANK SHAD UNDER THE GAS STOVE 

Rub the board thoroughly with salt; put it under the gas to 
heat. As soon as it is heated, put on the fish, skin side down, 
folding over the centre the same as in the preceding recipe ; 
baste with butter ; dust with salt and pepper, and put it under 
the gas just as far from the flame as possible; keep the lights 
turned up rather high until the fish has taken on a good color ; 
then turn them down and cook slowly thirty minutes. Have 
ready pared four good-sized potatoes ; put them on at once to 
boil ; when done mash, add a half cup of hot milk, a teaspoonful 
of salt, and beat until very light. Put them into a pastry bag, 
at the end of which you have a star tube. As soon as the fish 
has browned, remove it from the oven, and press the potatoes 
through the tube, making a circle of roses the entire round of 
the dish; put back into the oven, and allow the potatoes to 
brown ; garnish with sprigs of parsley and lemon, and send at 
once to the table. 

TO PLANK FISH ON AN OIL STOVE 

When the oven is very hot, put in the board, putting down the 
side on which you are going to place the fish. When the board 
is very hot, place the fish on it the same as for a gas stove ; then 
run it back into the oven on the upper grate, keeping the lights 
turned up full force. Put asbestos pads on the lower grate so 
that the heat will be driven around and on top of the board. 
Prepare potatoes as before ; garnish and brown the same as in 
preceding recipe. 

TO PLANK FISH IN A COAL STOVE 

This will be done in precisely the same manner as with the oil 
stove, in the general oven. Be sure the plank is very hot 
before placing the fish, and then put it as near the top of the 
oven as possible. There is less danger of the board burn- 



110 MRS. RORER's new COOK BOOK 

ing in a coal stove than in -an oil stove ; hence there is no neces- 
sity of protecting the bottom. 

HALIBUT STEAK a la FLAMANDE 

I good-sized halibut steak i chopped onion 
Yolk of one egg i tablespoonful of lemon juice 

I teaspoonful of salt i saltspoonful of pepper 

I tablespoonful of butter 

Wash the steak and dry carefully with cheesecloth. Brush the 
bottom of an ordinary baking pan with a little butter ; sprinkle 
it over with the chopped onion, on top of which place the steak. 
Beat the yolk of the egg and put it over the upper side of the 
steak; dust with salt, pepper, pour over the lemon juice, and 
the remaining portion of the butter cut into small bits. In a 
coal, stove, run it into a very hot oven and bake thirty minutes. 
In a gas stove, put it in the oven for fifteen minutes, then 
underneath in the broiling chamber for fifteen minutes longer. 
When done dish carefully on a hot platter, garnish with lemon 
and parsley and serve with brown sauce made in the pan in 
which the fish was cooked. 

STURGEON 

2 pounds of sturgeon i tablespoonful of butter 

I pint of milk i tablespoonful of flour 

I teaspoonful of salt i saltspoonful of pepper 

Cut the fish into squares of two inches ; put them into a stewing 
pan ; cover with two quarts of boiling water ; simmer gently 
fifteen minutes, and drain and throw away this water. This is 
done to extract the oil and strong flavor of the fish. Add to the 
saucepan the butter, salt and pepper. Moisten the flour 
gradually with the milk ; strain it over the sturgeon ; bring to 
boiling point and serve. 

Sturgeon may be broiled, panned or baked, but must always 
be parboiled first. 

EELS 

Eels may be stewed or fried or made into a sort of chowder. 
To stew them, skin, clean and cut oflf the heads, and then cut 




FISH 111 

them into pieces two inches long. Put them into a stewing pan ; 
cover with boiling ws^er, acid a tablespoonful of vinegar and 
simmer for ten minutes. Drain. Put a tablespoonful of butter 
in a saucepan ; when melted add two tablespoonf uls of flour ; 
mix well, and add a pint of the water in which the eels were 
stewed. When boiling, add a tablespoonful of grated onion, 
a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and the eels. 
Cover and stew gently for twenty minutes. Dish, dust thickly 
with chopped parsley and garnish with triangular pieces of 
toasted bread. 



JERUSALEM FISH BALLS 

Skin and pick all the flesh from the bones of a good-sized rock 
or haddock. Put the skin and bones with any bits that may 
have fastened themselves, into a kettle; cover with a quart of 
cold water, add a bay leaf, a slice of onion, a blade of mace, four 
cloves and two cloves of garlic mashed. Cover the saucepan 
and simmer gently one hour. While the mixture is cooking, 
chop the flesh of the fish very fine, add twenty-four blanched 
almonds, chopped, one clove of garlic, a teaspoonful of salt and 
a saltspoonful of white pepper and a quarter of a saltspoonful 
of mace. Mix well and form into balls the size of an English 
walnut. Strain the stock, return it to the saucepan and when 
it reaches the boiling point drop into it the fish balls. Draw the 
saucepan to one side of the fire, cover and let the balls cook 
slowly for twenty minutes. Lift the balls with a skimmer and 
stand at once in a very cold place. Beat six eggs until thor- 
oughly mixed, add to them gradually the boiling stock, which 
should now measure about three-quarters of a pint. Stand the 
mixture over hot water and stir until thick and jelly-like. Take 
from the fire, strain through a fine sieve and stand aside to 
cool. When slightly cool, add the juice of three lemons, or the 
juice of two lemons and a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar. 
When ready to serve, roll each ball in this cold dressing. 
Arrange in pyramid form in a dainty round dish ; garnish 
nicely with quarters of lemon and parsley, and send to the table 
with the remaining sauce in a boat.

TO CURE AND SMOKE FISH 

White fish, shad, mackerel and roe herring may all be cured 
after this same recipe. Scale and wash the fish quickly and 
wipe them perfectly dry. They must not be allowed to remain 
a moment in the water, or they will not keep. To each twenty 
pounds of fish allow one pint of good Liverpool salt, one pint 
of best brown sugar and an ounce of saltpetre ; mix these well 
together. Rub the fish thoroughly inside and out with this 
mixture, and place them one on top of another on a perfectly 
clean board, on the top of which place another board holding 
a weight of at least ten pounds. Allow them to remain in a 
cold place for at least sixty hours; drain; wipe each one 
dry, stretch open and fasten with small crossed sticks. Smoke 
for five days. Where one has not a smoke house, a barrel or 
box may be used for the purpose. Remove both heads from an 
ordinary barrel ; make in the bottom a smothered fire, using a 
few chips of hard wood; have the fish all ready to hang on 
sticks across the top when the fire is lighted; throw over a 
cover, and allow the fish to smoke. 

TO SALT FISH 

For this select salmon, shad, white fish or mackerel. Scale and 
clean the fish; wash and wipe them quickly. Make a brine 
sufficiently strong to float an egg, from good salt and boiling 
water. The water may be boiled and cooled, or you may add 
the salt to the boiling water and allow them to cool together. 
Put the fish into a perfectly clean cask ; cover with the cold 
brine ; put a small board on top holding a weight, to keep the 
fish under the brine. 

TO SPICE OR PICKLE FISH 

10 pounds of fish 2 quarts of white wine vinegar 

4 blades of mace 12 whole cloves 

I small onion i bay leaf 

I small red pepper 2 tablespoonfuls of whole mus- 

4 tablespoonfuls of grated tard 

horseradish 3^ pint of boiling water 
Wash the fish in cold water; put into the kettle; cover with 



FISH 



118 



boiling water, add a tablespoonful of salt, and cook slowly for 
fifteen minutes to each pound of fish. Then drain, and stand 
aside in a cold place over night. In the morning remove the 
skin, and cut the fish into small convenient pieces. Put the 
vinegar and all the spices into a small porcelain lined kettle. 
When it comes to the boiling point, add the fish, and simmer 
for just a moment. Lift each piece with a skimmer; arrange 
them carefully in glass jars; adjust the rubbers; fill the jars 
with the hot spiced vinegar, and screw on the tops. Stand aside 
in a cold place. Next day, wipe down the jars and give the 
tops an extra screw, or see that they are well fastened. If 
properly done, the fish will keep in a cold place for one year. 

This recipe will answer for sturgeon, halibut, salmon; in 
fact almost any kind of fish. 



FROGS 

The hind legs of frogs are the only part used as food. There 
is no objection to using the entire fleshy part of the body; 
there is so little flesh, however, on the upper part that it is 
scarcely worth the cleaning. Cover them first with boiling 
water; allow them to stand for five minutes to blanch; dirain, 
dry, and dust with flour. Put them in a frying basket and 
plunge it into hot fat. Oil, of course, is preferable for the fry- 
ing. They may be served plain or with sauce tartare or cream 
sauce. 

FROGS a la POULETTE

Trim the legs ; cover them with boiHng water and stand aside 
for fifteen minutes. Drain. Put the butter and flour into a 
saucepan ; when smooth add the stock or milk, stir until boil- 
ing, add the salt and pepper. Add the frogs' legs ; cover the 



114 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

saucepan and stand in a water bath or over hot water for 
twenty minutes. Take from the fire, add the beaten yolk of the 
egg and chopped parsley, and serve at once. 



CRUSTACEAE 

To this order belong the lobster, crabs, prawns and crawfish. 

All are placed in the nitrogenous group of foods, those 
which contribute to building and repair of the muscles and 
tissues. 

They are, however, very dense and difficult of digestion, and 
to be at all safe must be fresh and alive when cooked. If 
allowed to die, they are most dangerous. They must also be 
used soon after cooking. These as well as oysters are easily 
contaminated by ptomaines. 

to kill a lobster 

Have ready a large kettle nearly filled with warm water. It is 
not necessary that the water be boiling ; in fact, the lobster will 
die more quickly in warm than in boiling water. Hold the 
lobster upside down, grasping him by the back ; put his head, 
then his body under the water and quickly cover the kettle. He 
will die instantly. 

To broil a lobster take it from the water immediately, cut it 
into halves, remove the stomach and the intestine, and it is 
ready to broil, or follow directions given under Broiled Live 
Lobster. 

For salad, lobster Newburg or any dish which calls for the 
simple re-heating of the meat, cook slowly for three-quarters 
of an hour, adding salt after cooking a half hour. Rapid boil- 
ing toughens the meat. Let the water simmer at about i8o° 
Fahr. 

Where the lobster is to be kept over night or from Saturday 
until Sunday, as is frequently the case, it must be boiled and 
chilled quickly. It is better to put it directly on the ice. Do 
not remove the meat from the shell until you are ready to use 
it. Under no circumstances should the meat be taken from the 
shell, put into an open vessel and placed in a cellar. Such con- 



FISH 



116 



ditions are apt to produce ptomaine poisonings, especially if 
there are decomposing materials in the cellar. 

TO OPEN A LOBSTER 

After the lobster is thoroughly chilled twist off the claws and 
then the tail shell from the body. Split the tail underneath 
directly down the centre, and remove the meat in one long piece. 
Pull open the body shell, take out the "liver" of the lobster, 
which you will know by its greenish soft condition ; also the 
coral. Then lift the body from the shell ; remove the stomach, 
sometimes called the "lady," which is found irrimediately under- 
neath the head. Throw this away. Pick the meat from the 
shells ; break into halves the solid piece of meat that you have 
taken from the tail and remove the intestine running its entire 
length. Crack the claws and pick out the meat. 

TO SERVE PLAIN 

Arrange the meat neatly in the centre of a cold platter, garnish 
with the small claws, crisp, light leaves of lettuce, hard boiled 
eggs cut into quarters, and pickled beets cut into fancy shapes. 
Pass with this French dressing.

the eggs and cook just a moment. Take from the fire and stir 
in carefully the lobster. Turn out to cool. When perfectly 
cold, form into cutlet-shaped croquettes ; dip in beaten egg, and 
cover v^ith bread crumbs. Put them, a few at a time, in the 
frying basket and fry in hot fat until a nice brown. This will 
take about two minutes. Lift each carefully; rest for a few 
moments on soft brown paper to drain. When ready to serve, 
put in the end of each cutlet one of the small claws, or the little 
sticks with the frill of paper on the end, which come for the 
purpose. Garnish with parsley and serve with sauce tartare in 
a separate dish, or cream sauce, put in the plate first, the cut- 
lets arranged on it. 

LOBSTER FARCI 

This is precisely the same as deviled lobster, using the entire 
shell of the lobster turned upside down for holding the farci. 
Brush the farci with egg, dust with bread crumbs, and brown 
in the oven.

stand over hot water until thoroughly heated ; then stir in the 
yolk of the egg and pour into the centre of a deep dish that has 
been lined with carefully boiled rice ; dust the whole with 
chopped parsley and send at once to the table. If you have 
used a hen lobster with coral, mash the coral and sprinkle 
it over the rice, and the parsley over the lobster.

slowly for five minutes. Rub together the butter and flour ; add 
gradually the tomato ; bring to boiling point, and stand over hot 
water. Open the lobster and cut it into squares of one inch. 
Strain the tomato sauce ; add to it the lobster ; cover and place 
over hot water for fifteen minutes, and it is ready to serve. 
Garnish the dish with triangular pieces of toasted bread.

and pepper and then the lobster ; mix carefully ; stand over 
hot water for twenty minutes. If fresh mushrooms are used, 
wash, cut into quarters, put them with the butter into the sauce- 
pan, and push to the back of the stove to cook slowly for ten 
minutes ; draw them to one side in the saucepan ; add the flour

to the butter ; mix, add the milk and stir until boiling ; then add 
the lobster, and when hot, serve. 



BROILED LIVE LOBSTER 

The lobster may be killed by cutting it carefully at the joint 
where the tail and body shell come together. Leave it for a 
moment, then split it directly into halves ; remove the stomach 
and intestine. Put it in a wire boiler ; place it over a clear fire, 
shell side down, for about ten minutes ; turn and broil the flesh 
side for ten minutes longer ; turn it back and baste the flesh side 
with a Httle butter, and dust it with salt and pepper. Broil 
slowly ten minutes longer. Take it from the broiler ; crack the 
claws ; dish neatly on a hot platter. Serve with it a small sauce 
boat of melted butter. The meat can be most easily picked out 
and eaten with an oyster fork. One lobster is served to each 
two persons.

slowly until the onion is tender, not brown; press through a 
sieve; return the mixture to the kettle. Add the fresh mush- 
rooms that have been washed and have the stems removed. Do 
not peel them. Cover the saucepan ; cook slowly for ten min- 
utes ; draw them to one side ; add the flour, rub until perfectly 
smooth and add the stock, the kitchen bouquet, salt and pepper ; 
add the lobster that has been boiled and cut into large pieces. 
Make four pieces of the tail, four of each claw. Stand the 
mixture over hot water for ten minutes. Dish the lobster in the 
centre of a small dish ; put the mushrooms over the top, and 
strain over the sauce ; garnish the edge of the dish with small 
triangular pieces of toasted bread. This may also be served in 
pate shells or bouche cases.

LOBSTER a la NEWBURG 



119 



I heavy lobster Yolks of 3 hard boiled eggs 
^ of a cup of cream 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 
3^ teaspoonful of salt i tablespoonful of flour 
I saltspoonful of pepper i saltspoonful of grated nutmeg 
6 tablespoonfuls of sherry or or 2 drops essence of nut- 
Madeira meg 

Boil the lobster; when cold, remove the meat; cut into large 
pieces the same as for lobster Bordelaise; sprinkle over the 
sherry, and stand it aside for two or three hours. Rub the but- 
ter and flour together; add the cream cold; stand over hot 
water until the mixture is thick but not boiling. Press the yolks 
of the eggs through a sieve into a bowl ; with a limber knife or 
wooden spoon rub them to a paste, adding gradually the hot 
sauce ; add it slowly, a tablespoonful at a time. When this is 
perfectly smooth, strain through a sieve, add the salt, pepper 
and nutmeg; add the lobster; stand the whole over hot water 
until smoking hot; serve immediately. This may be made in 
the afternoon, and re-heated at serving time in the chafing dish, 
using the water pan. 

In putting the wine over the lobster, you get the flavor of 
the wine without diluting the sauce. If the wine is added to the 
sauce it becomes liquid, leaving the lobster uncovered. 

This recipe may be used for all dishes a la Newburg, simply 
substituting other meats for the lobster, using the same sauce. 

CRABS 

Crabs, like lobsters, are in season during the summer, in good 
condition from the first of May to the first of September ; they 
are, of course, in the market at other times, but cannot be said 
to be in good condition. Crabs, like lobsters, must be purchased 
alive, put into warm water, and boiled in precisely the same 
way. Lift the crabs with tongs ; do not attempt to handle them, 
as they are not as easily handled as lobsters. Put in one at a 
time ; cover the kettle and wait for it to die ; then put in 
another ; when the last is in and the water has reached almost 
the boiling point, add a tablespoonful of salt and cook slowly 



120 MRS. RORER's new COOK BOOK 

for thirty minutes. Take them from the fire, and when cool 
twist off the legs ; pull off the "aprons," the loose flaps on under 
shells; separate the shells; remove the stomach, which is just 
underneath the head, and the little "twist" of intestines and 
the gills or "dead men's fingers." Cut the crab directly into 
halves, so that the meat may be picked out carefully without 
getting the finer portions of the shell. 

TO SERVE COLD 

Wash and dry the upper shells ; fill them with cold crab meat, 
dish and garnish with cress. Serve with French dressing. 

DEVILED CRABS 

12 crabs Yz pint of milk 

1 tablespoonful of butter i tablespoonful of chopped 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour parsley 

Yolks of 4 hard boiled eggs i teaspoonful of onion juice 
Yi. teaspoonful of paprika i level teaspoonful of salt 

Dash of white pepper 

After the crabs are boiled and cold and the meat removed, 
select and clean nine of the nicest upper shells. Rub the butter 
and flour together in a saucepan ; add the milk cold ; stir over 
the fire until it just reaches the boiling point. Mash the yolks 
of the eggs, work into them carefully this hot sauce. Add all 
the seasoning to the crab meat. Mix the two together. Allow 
the meat to remain in as large pieces as possible. Fill into the 
back shells, smoothing them down neatly. Beat two eggs ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of warm water. Pick up the crab shell, hold- 
ing it by the very point ; cover it over carefully with the beaten 
^^'g', dust quickly with bread crumbs, fastening securely with 
the ^g'g and bread crumb the part where the meat and shells 
come together, otherwise the fat will enter during the frying 
and the crabs will be spoiled. When ready to use, put them, two 
or three at a time according to the size, into the frying basket ; 
plunge them into hot fat and cook about one minute, and serve. 
White soft bread crumbs make a much handsomer deviled 
crab than the dry crumbs. Take the centre of a stale loaf of

divided. As soon as you have covered each deviled crab with 
egg, quickly sprinkle it with the crumbs. Crabs may be served 
alone, or sauce tartare may be passed with them. 

CRAB CROQUETTES 

These are precisely the same as lobster cutlets. Form into 
pyramid shaped croquettes, dip in egg and bread crumbs, and 
fry in hot fat. 

CREAMED CRABS 

Make a cream sauce ; add the usual seasoning, and fold in care- 
fully the meat from one dozen crabs. When hot serve in patty 
shells, bread boxes, on toast or in bouche cases. 

CRABS IN TOMATO CASES 

12 crabs 2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon 
6 tablespoonfuls of oil vinegar 

I lemon I clove of garlic 

I teaspoonful of onion juice i tablespoonful of chopped 
I level teaspoonful of salt parsley 

12 small tomatoes i saltspoonful of pepper 

Boil the crabs, remove the meat, put over it the juice of the 
lemon and stand aside until very cold. Peel the tomatoes. Cut 
a slice from the stem end and scoop out the centre ; stand them 
on the ice until cold. When ready to serve, make a French 
dressing of salt, pepper, oil, vinegar and onion juice. Rub the 
bowl in which you make it with a clove of garlic. Fill the crab 
into the tomato shells, baste each carefully with French dress- 
ing, stand them in little nests of cress or lettuce leaves and send 
at once to the table. 

CRABS WITH FRESH MUSHROOMS

With your cake cutter cut from a slice of bread a round suffi- 
ciently large to hold a good-sized mushroom. Put six of these 



122 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



into the oven until crisp and brown. Wash six large mush- 
rooms ; trim the stems flush with the gills. Have ready boiled 
and picked apart six crabs. Put the mushrooms in an ordinary 
baking pan, gill side up; dust them lightly with salt; bake in a 
quick oven ten minutes or until tender. They must retain their 
shape. While these are heating, put the crab meat in a double 
boiler or over hot water. Rub the butter and flour together, 
add the stock, and, when boiling, the kitchen bouquet, salt and 
pepper. Lift the mushrooms carefully, put each, skin side 
down, on a round of toast. Heap the crab meat into a pyramid 
in the centre of each mushroom ; baste over a little of the brown 
sauce ; pour the remainder in the bottom of the dish ; garnish 
the ends of the dish with large bunches of parsley. Left-over 
fish may be substituted for the crab meat. 



SOFT SHELL CRABS 

Soft shell crabs are nothing more than the hard shell crabs 
shedding their shells. They are to be had from July to Sep- 
tember. W^hen a crab or lobster outgrows its shell, it has the 
power of splitting down the back, drawing its hands, as it were, 
out of the ''sleeves" or claw shells, retiring until the new shell 
becomes hard and protective. It is under these conditions that 
we have soft shell crabs; not the most hygienic food that one 
can possibly take, as all animals during this period of ''moult- 
ing" are more or less in a state of disease. However, we have 
trained our artificial palates to like the flavor; hence they are 
in demand and at a large price. The new shell becomes hard 
in about three days, which accounts for the always short supply. 
These must be cooked actually alive. While we throw lobsters 
into boiling water to kill them, we pull apart the soft shell crab 
in a live condition, and put it into the frying pan while it is 
dying. And still we are civilized. 

To prepare, lift the shell and remove the spongy fingers or 
gills from both sides. Then put your thumb nail under the 
point of the "apron," and pull it off. The apron is the small 
loose shell running to a point or round in the middle of the 
under shell. Now wash and wipe the crabs ; dip them at once in 



FISH 



128 



beaten egg, roll them in bread crumbs, and dust with salt and 
pepper, or you may dip them in egg alone, and plunge them at 
once into hot fat. Many cooks prefer to saute them ; that is to 
fry in a small quantity of fat, cooking first on one side, then on 
the other. Either method requires about ten minutes. When 
done, throw them on soft brown paper, and dish them on toast 
garnished with parsley and lemon cut into quarters. Pass sauce 
tartare in a separate dish. 

CRAWFISH AND SHRIMPS 

These are usually sold boiled, and are capable of being made 
into any of the recipes given for lobster or crabs. Shrimps in 
cream sauce, shrimp salad and shrimps a la Bordelaise are per- 
haps among the best of the shrimp dishes ; or they may be 
served cold with French dressing. Crawfish are used to 
garnish fancy dishes of lobster. 



MOLLUSKS 

Scientists have recently been turning a little of their attention 
to the investigation of the food for man. It is almost a uni- 
versal rule that all animal food must be subjected to a high 
temperature to remove the dangerous germs. In these days 
even milk must be Pasteurized, at least, to be at all safe. No 
thinking person drinks raw milk, unless they have had a per- 
sonal introduction to the cow from which it was taken, and, 
moreover, to the surroundings in which both cow and milk are 
kept. Man, however, breaks away, as it were, from all these 
thoughts, and eats his oysters and clams raw. Oysters are 
perhaps as unclean as any other animal food. They are fre- 
quently fattened in objectionable places, and are eaten alive, 
intestines and all. The thought is certainly not a pleasant one. 
Cases of typhoid have been directly traced to the eating of raw 
oysters. It seems perfectly rational and quite consistent that 
the germ of typhoid should live and thrive inside of an oyster 
shell, and, if eaten uncooked, must certainly be transferred to 



124

man. They are palatable, hence will always be eaten raw by 
unthinking people. 

The masses pay too much attention to the palate, and too 
little to the building of the body. 

Cooking kills the dangerous germs. 



OYSTER.S 

Oysters are in season from September until May ist; are better, 
of course, during the winter months. They come in as lobsters 
and crabs go out. They must under all circumstances be alive 
and fresh when used. Oysters that have been opened for a 
few hours lose their flavor and firmness, and are inferior to a 
freshly opened oyster. 

Oysters when stale are poisonous, 

STEWED OYSTERS

Drain the oysters in a colander. Do not use this "liquor." 
Plunge them, colander and all, into a pan of cold water and 
drain again. Throw them into a hot saucepan; shake quickly, 
add the milk. Rub the butter and flour together, and stir it 
carefully into the stew ; add the allspice ; watch carefully until 
it just reaches the boiling point; add the salt and pepper and 
serve at once.

saving the liquor; add to this the milk. Rub the butter and 
flour together, add the milk and oyster liquor ; stir until boiling ; 
add the salt, cayenne and oysters. When the whole is thor- 
oughly heated, take from the fire and add the yolks of the eggs 
slightly beaten. This may be served with a garnish of triangu- 
lar pieces of toast, or it may be served on toast, in pate shells 
or in bread boxes, garnished with parsley. 

OYSTERS FOR FILLING PATTIES 

25 small oysters ^ pint of cream or milk , 

I tablespoonful of butter Suspicion of mace 

I tablespoonful of flour ^ teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Drain and wash the oysters ; throw them into a saucepan ; stir 
carefully until the gills are curled; drain, saving the Hquor. 
Rub the butter and flour together ; add the cream cold ; stir over 
hot water until smooth and thick, not boiling; add the mace, 
salt and pepper and oyster liquor ; stir in the oysters, stand over 
hot water a few minutes, and it is ready for use. 

This is the mixture used for filling oyster vol-au-vent, or 
bread pate, or bread boats, or urns. 

DRY PAN 

Drain and wash twenty-five oysters. Put an iron saute pan or 
spider over a quick fire ; when hissing hot throw in quickly the 
oysters ; shake and stir at once until they reach the boiling 
point; add a half teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of white 
pepper, a tablespoonful of butter and serve immediately in a 
hot dish. This is perhaps one of the best ways of cooking 
oysters.

griddle. Put by the side of it a double boiler, the under one 
partly filled with boiling water, the upper part empty. Take 
the colander near the stove, throw the oysters, three or four at 
a time, on the griddle ; as fast as they brown on one side, turn 
and brown the other, then lift quickly into the double boiler. 
When you have finished, draw the boiler to one side of the fire. 
Put the butter into a saucepan, add the curry, stir for a 
moment, then add the flour. Now turn the oysters into this 
mixture ; stir carefully until they reach boiling point ; add the 
grated onion and the lemon juice, and serve.

oysters; drain again, adding this to the other liquor. Rub 
the butter and flour together, add the oyster liquor and milk 
cold ; stir over the fire until they reach the boiling point ; 
add all the seasoning and the yolks of the eggs slightly beaten ; 
cook just a moment longer ; add the oysters, and stand aside to 
cool. When cold, fill the mixture into the deep shell of the 
oyster or into clam shells or in any individual shells that you 
may have in the house. Beat an ^%g until the white and yolk 
are thoroughly mixed; add a tablespoonful of warm water; 
beat again. Take the shell in your hand and baste it all over 
with this beaten ^Z'g\ then dust thickly with bread crumbs, 
cementing well where the mixture and shell come together. 
When ready to serve put a few at a time in a frying basket 
and plunge them into hot fat.

plunged into the hot fat, otherwise the fat will penetrate and 
spoil the flavor of the mixture. 

This same mixture may be put into individual or ramekin 
dishes, covered with browned bread crumbs and put into the 
oven a few minutes to heat. 



DEVILED OYSTERS No. 2 

For this use the same quantities as in preceding recipe. Par- 
boil the oysters, chop and drain them ; save the liquor and add 
to it the milk. Put the butter in the chafing dish ; add the flour, 
then the oyster liquor and milk ; when boiling add the season- 
ing, the chopped oysters, and when these are smoking hot stir 
in at the last moment the yolks of the eggs slightly beaten. Be 
careful now that the mixture does not boil or it will curdle. 
When smoking hot, serve. 



OYSTERS PANNED IN THE CHAFING DISH 

Have the oysters drained and washed. Light the burners 
under the blazer ; when the blazer is slightly heated, throw in 
the oysters ; stir constantly until the gills have curled and the 
mixture actually boils. Add a tablespoonful of butter, a half 
teaspoon ful of salt, a dash of cayenne, a half saltspoonful of 
white pepper, and serve at once. 

This recipe may be varied by occasionally adding a little 
cream or a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, or, for those who 
use it, four tablespoonfuls of wine. 



PHILADELPHIA BROILED OYSTERS 

Select large fat oysters; lay them out singly on a board, dry 
carefully with a piece of cheesecloth; dust with salt and 
cayenne on both sides. Put over the fire your double boiler, the 
water boiling in the underneath part. Put into it a tablespoon- 
ful of butter and one of flour ; mix, and add a half pint of stock 



128 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

or water, the first preferable. When this thickens, add a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper, a saltspoonful of 
white pepper and a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet; and two 
tablespoonfuls of sherry, if you use it. Let it stand on the back 
part of the stove while you broil the oysters. Put over the hot- 
test part of the fire the ordinary cake griddle. Have the oysters 
at hand, and when the griddle is smoking hot brush it lightly 
with a little butter; throw on four or five oysters, brown 
quickly; turn, and as soon as they are brown on this side, lift 
them into the brown sauce, and so continue until all the oysters 
are "broiled." To have these a perfect success, your gridiron 
must be very, very hot, and only a few oysters at a time 
browned. The moment an oyster touches a hot surface, it parts 
with its juice, and the juice will prevent the browning, hence 
the necessity of doing only four or five at a time. Dish on 
toast, and pour over the brown sauce. 



OYSTERS BROILED UNDER A GAS STOVE 

Select twenty-five oysters; dry, and season as directed in pre- 
ceding recipes. Put under the gas flame an ordinary shallow 
baking pan ; when the *pan is very hot, brush the bottom lightly 
with butter, and throw in the oysters ; put it back under and as 
near the flame as possible. When the oysters have quickly 
browned on this side, turn and brown on the other. Serve at 
once in a very hot dish ; add a tablespoonful of butter, or they 
may be served on toast. This is perhaps one of the simplest 
and most palatable ways of cooking oysters. 



BAKED OYSTERS 

Select nice large oysters in the shell; wash, scrub and rinse 
until the shells are free from sand. Place in a baking pan, and 
then in a quick oven (about 400° Fahr.) ; bake for ten or fifteen 
minutes until the shells open. Take from the oven, and quickly 
remove the upper shell. Arrange six on a dinner plate with a 
little cup of melted butter, seasoned with salt and pepper, 



r

placed in the centre, and send at once to the table. To eat these, 
remove the oysters from the shell with an oyster fork, and dip 
them into melted butter. 



STEAMED OYSTERS 

Select nice good-sized oysters. Wash, scrub and rinse the 
shells until free from sand. Put them into a steamer over boil- 
ing water, and steam rapidly for fifteen or twenty minutes until 
the shells are open. Serve precisely the same as baked oysters. 



PHILADELPHIA FRIED OYSTERS 

Select for frying, oysters of a good size and in the best condi- 
tion possible. Drain in a colander ; lift them one by one using 
the fingers, picking them up by the muscular portion, and place 
them out on a dry board. Dry on both sides with a piece of 
soft cheesecloth. Never lift an oyster with a fork, as the stick- 
ing of the fork into the muscular portion of the oyster spoils 
its flavor and makes perforations which cannot always be 
covered. Do not use a spoon, as you are liable to take a portion 
of the juice with the oyster, and this makes them difficult to fry. 
Sprinkle the oysters with salt and cayenne. To each dozen 
oysters allow one egg. Beat the white and yolk together until 
thoroughly mixed; add a tablespoonful of warm water; beat 
again. Spread out on a dry board a large "bed" of nicely 
rolled and dry bread crumbs. Do not use cracker crumbs. Lift 
the oyster, again with the thumb and forefinger, always grasp- 
ing it by the muscular part, dip first into the bread crumbs, 
then quickly into the egg, and back into the bread crumbs, this 
time cover it all over, and press it lightly with the hand ; be 
careful, however, not to bruise the oyster. Put singly on a dry 
cloth ready for frying. Be careful in dipping that you do not 
get the bread crumbs mixed with the egg, or the egg with the 
bread crumbs. After dipping the oyster in crumbs, shake 
lightly ; dip it quickly into the egg that you may not wash off 
the crumbs. After you have dipped the last oyster, which 
should be done before the frying begins, put the fat over the 



180 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

fire ; oil, either olive or cotton seed, will be first choice, cocoanut 
butter being, perhaps, equally good; second choice, a mixture 
of oil and suet ; third, a mixture of lard and suet. Lard alone 
will not give good results. I should much prefer to use suet 
alone. Under no circumstances fry an oyster in butter, it is 
greasy, unpalatable, unsightly and difficult of digestion. Watch 
the fat carefully until it reaches 360° to 365° (Fahr.). If 
you are without a thermometer, drop in a bit of bread; if it 
browns in twenty seconds, the fat is sufficiently heated. Put 
about six oysters in a frying basket, plunge into the hot fat ; as 
soon as the oysters are a golden brown, lift the basket, drain, 
stand them edgewise on a piece of soft brown paper in the 
bottom of a baking pan, and stand in the oven a moment to 
drain. Quickly fry another basketful, and so continue until 
you have all the oysters fried. If these are to be served as an 
accompaniment to a salad course at dinner, fry them while 
the previous course is being served ; they must be sent at once 
to the table. Warmed over oysters are heavy and unpalatable. 
Where they form the main "meat dish" at supper or lunch, 
they should be fried during the meal, that the plate may 
be replenished with hot, fresh, crisp oysters. A large quantity 
may be dipped an hour or two before frying time, provided 
they are spread out singly on a clean cloth in a cold place ; but 
the frying must be done at the last moment. Garnish the dish 
with quarters of lemon and parsley, and serve with them either 
cabbage salad, pepper hash, or stuffed mangoes. 



SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

Drain, wash and drain again, fifty oysters. Prepare a quart of 
dry bread or toast cut into dice. The easier way is to cut the 
bread into dice and put it in the oven until hard and dry. Put 
a layer of this into the bottom of a baking dish, then a layer 
of oysters, a sprinkling of salt and pepper and a half table- 
spoonful of butter cut into bits; then another layer of bread 
and oysters, and so continue until all the materials are used, 
having the last layer bread. Over the top put bits of butter; 
baste the bread on top with a half cup of milk ; bake in a quick 



I

oven twenty minutes. Serve at once In the same dish in which 
they are baked. 

These are exceedingly nice when made in the deep under 
shells of the oyster instead of an ordinary baking pan. Cover 
the shell with fine dry bread crumbs ; put in three or four 
oysters, dust with salt and pepper; cover with fine bread 
crumbs, dotting here and there with bits of butter. Put these 
in a baking pan and into a quick oven for ten minutes. The 
roasting or baking in the shell imparts a savor to the oyster 
not obtainable in an ordinary baking dish. 

OYSTERS AND MACARONI

I tablespoonful of butter 4 tablespoonfuls of soft cheese 
Yz cup (i gill) of milk or 2 tablespoonfuls of 

I teaspocnful of salt parmesan 

I saltspoonful of white pepper 

Boil the macaroni by throwing it into a kettle of boiling water ; 
cook twenty minutes ; drain ; throw into cold water until white 
and swollen ; drain again ; cut into lengths of one inch. Drain 
and wash the oysters. Cover the bottom of a baking dish with 
the boiled macaroni, then put in a layer of oysters, a dusting of 
salt and pepper, and so continue until the dish is full, having 
the last layer macaroni ; sprinkle over the cheese, then a layer 
of soft bread crumbs ; on top put the butter cut into bits, and 
baste the whole carefully with the milk. Bake in a quick oven 
twenty minutes. Send at once to the table in the dish in which 
it was cooked. 

OYSTERS AND TRIPE 

25 fat oysters i pound of honeycomb tripe

The tripe must be boiled until perfectly tender, and cut into 
narrow strips or dice. Put the butter into a saucepan ; add the

soft, not brown. Now add the flour, mix, add the milk, stir 
until boiling, and add the tripe and oysters. When the oysters 
are thoroughly cooked so that the gills are curled, add the salt 
and pepper and serve at once. 

OYSTER CROQUETTES 

25 nice fat oysters i gill of oyster liquor

I tablespoonful of chopped i tablespoonful of butter

I level teaspoonful of salt About 3 shakes of cayenne 

Drain and wash the oysters; drain again. Throw them into a 
hot saucepan and stir over the fire until they have actually 
boiled. Drain, this time saving the liquor. With a silver knife, 
chop the oysters fine ; drain, add this liquor to the first. Put 
the butter and flour in a saucepan; add the oyster liquor and 
milk ; stir over the fire until thick and smooth. Take from the 
fire, add the yolks of the eggs slightly beaten, the bread crumbs, 
the oysters and all the seasoning. Put back over the fire and 
stir until the mixture reaches the boiling point ; turn out to 
cool. When perfectly cold form into cylinder-shaped cro- 
quettes, dip in egg and then in bread crumbs, and fry in hot 
fat (365° Fahr.). 

TO PRESERVE OYSTERS FOR SALAD 

Oysters may be pickled and put aside to serve as oyster salad, 
when fresh oysters are out of season. These are really much 
more wholesome than oysters canned or preserved in any other 
way. 

50 oysters 2 blades of mace

the oysters and the liquor are perfectly cold, strain the liquor 
through two thicknesses of cheese-cloth; to a pint of this 
liquor, add a pint of white wine vinegar and put them into a 
porcelain lined kettle ; add the spices. Arrange the oysters in 
glass jars; adjust the rubbers. When the vinegar has really 
boiled, dip it carefully over the oysters in the jars; fill the jars 
to overflowing and screw on the tops and stand at once in a 
cold place. These will keep for some time, or may be used the 
same day. Cider vinegar will not answer the purpose; white 
wine vinegar only will keep oysters. 

LITTLE PIGS IN BLANKETS 

This old recipe has been used for a number of years by many 
American cooks. The oysters are drained and dried and each 
one wrapped in a very thin slice of bacon, the whole fastened 
with a small wooden skewer or toothpick. When ready to 
serve have a large iron baking pan well heated ; throw in a few 
oysters at a time, and as soon as they are browned and the gills 
curled, take them out, drain in a colander, and continue the fry- 
ing in the same pan. To eat pick them up by the skewer with 
the thumb and finger. 

CLAMS 

Clams are of several varieties, are more difficult of digestion 
than oysters, but are certainly less liable to contamination ; 
hence are safer in an uncooked condition. The Cherry Stone, 
Little Neck, and Sand clams are usually served raw. 

The mud clam or Quahaugs are used for clear broth and 
soup. The flesh of these is tough and very difficult of diges- 
tion. The small soft shell clams found in the summer and 
autumn so abundantly along the New England coast, are best 
steamed, served hot in their shells, with an accompanying cup or 
boat of broth. 

SCALLOPS 

A bivalve mollusk, of the family Pectinidae. The heavy muscle 
which holds together the shell is the only part used as food. 
They are sold by measure, and are usually stewed, fried or 
served a la Newburg.

MEATS 

Scientists in general agree that animal proteids yield more 
easily to the digestive apparatus of man than vegetable pro- 
teids. We might correctly call flesh a partly digested food, 
the animal having converted the vegetable tissues into animal 
tissues, which are exceedingly well adapted to the growth and 
maintenance of the organic structure of the human body. And, 
in our rapid method of living, it seems to suit better than the 
same amount of vegetable food. 

We in this generation find it difficult to digest the legumin- 
ous vegetables (peas, beans and lentils) which contain the pro- 
teid materials useful in the building of muscles and tissues ; 
hence the increased demand for meat. Primitive man found 
no difficulty whatever in building muscle, brain and nerve from 
these coarse vegetable foods ; but it must be borne in mind that 
his mental activity was far less than ours. Perhaps his bodily 
vigor was more intense ; but even this is doubtful if we sum up 
the hours of modern labor from the beginning to the end of 
life. The intense excitement and energy needed for the chase 
was of short duration compared to the working hours of the 
laborer of the twentieth century. Meats, in proper proportion 
then, are necessary to rapid development. I must contend, 
however, that a well selected vegetable diet will give health, 
bodily vigor and mental strength to those who live rationally. 
Opinions to the contrary are given by those experimenters who 
have for years lived on a mixed diet, largely meat, and quickly 
changed, for the sake of experimental purposes, to four or six 
weeks' vegetable diet, from which they make their report. A 
radical change of this kind must necessarily provoke irregulari- 
ties. Such experiments are of little value; they really prove 
nothing. Observe carefully those who have always lived 
largely on meat, those on a mixed diet of proper proportions, 
and the vegetarian, all occupying the same positions in the 

135 



136 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

world, simply choosing different foods for the same purpose. 
Such observations are of value. The vegetarian is quite equal 
in strength to either of the others and most likely freer from 
disease. The amount of proteid matter in plants is far less than 
in animals, except in the leguminous seeds. This proves at once 
that in a vegetable diet the right sort of vegetables must be 
used. For instance, it would be folly to substitute potatoes for 
meat, or any succulent vegetable for meat; peas, beans and 
lentils, the pulse tribe, alone will give the necessary amount of 
nitrogenous (muscle-making or tissue-building) foods. We 
have followed the practice — perhaps without knowing exactly 
why — of serving pork, which is a heat-producing food, with our 
beans, muscle-making food. Then, on the other hand, we serve 
potatoes with beef. Such combinations are wise. It would 
be foolish, indeed, to serve pork and potatoes. The vegetarian 
selects beans and potatoes, and thereby gets a greater amount 
of nitrogen, a larger proportion of muscle-making food, than 
from beef and potatoes. The out-door laborer, with an abund- 
ance of pure air, would in all wisdom select beans rather than 
beef. To the indoor laborer, however, beef would be prefer- 
able. It would suit his sluggish digestive apparatus much 
better; he could, without doubt, get a far greater amount of 
nitrogen with less expenditure of energy, from the beef. The 
proteid matter of animals and vegetables does not differ essen- 
tially in chemical composition. The remaining constituents, 
however, show the widest diversity. There is an entire absence 
of starch in animal food. In flesh we find muscular fibre with 
the blood vessels, nerves and connective tissues, and a variable 
proportion of water and fatty matter, the latter according to 
the method of keeping and feeding the animals. With one 
exception, the animals we use as foods are granivorous, and 
according to my opinion the hog — the exception — if he be used 
at all as food, should be fed upon vegetable substances. 

The ratio of water in fish, flesh and fowl is about the same. 
If a piece of lean beef be dried in the sunshine or by artificial 
methods, it will shrink, diminishing in bulk, losing its natural 
water. Four pounds of this flesh will leave but one pound of 
dried flesh, losing, as you see, 75 per cent, of water. It is said 



I 



MEATS 



137 



by many experimenters that the connective tissue of beef is 
more difficult of digestion than the ordinary fibre ; hence tough 
meat, caused by the development of these, must be cooked with 
moist heat to soften them, or ground thoroughly in a meat 
grinder, to tear them apart, before cooking. The fibre of meat, 
if washed free from other material, can easily be seen under a 
microscope. Take a small piece of lean beef, wash it carefully 
through several cold waters, and you will have left a mass of 
muscular or fibrous tissue, insoluble in alcohol, and only slightly 
softened when cooked in water. Beef is looked upon as 
being more nutritious than mutton, while mutton is the 
more easily digested. We must take into consideration, how- 
ever, that mutton contains more fat. To some, this would 
be objectionable, as cooked fat is rather difficult of emulsifi- 
cation. Fats are wholesome foods, but must be taken at the 
temperature of the body; hence the fats of meat, which must 
necessarily be cooked to be free from danger, are not desirable 
foods. About one-fourth of the dry substance of ordinary 
butchers' meat is fat; and this, you will remember, represents 
heat food, taking the place of starch in our vegetable foods, 
although it produces in the body a greater amount of heat 
and less fat. Moleschott says that "fat is the first material 
in the body to be burned for the production of animal heat." 
People of the arctic region live largely upon blubber, which 
produces the great bodily heat necessary in those cold climates, 
while in the southern warm climates, little fat is required. 
Starches and sugars have hydrogen and oxygen in the 
same proportions as they exist in water, burn more slowly, 
producing less heat. It is said that explorers in temperate 
or cold climates who have been obliged to live on wild animals 
and game (these, you will remember, are quite free from 
fat) are obliged to take with them oil, or now and then use 
some form of animal fat, as bacon, to keep up the balance 
of their dietary. Fowls contain less fat, as a rule, than 
beef or mutton, unless they are fed to excess, or "spayed," or 
castrated, as in the case of the "capon," or where they are 
simply crammed as are the geese of Strassburg, to make the 
fattened livers. The latter method, however, produces diseased 



138 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

flesh. Young animals, as veal, lamb and young chickens, con- 
tain less fat than those fully grown. Fish vary to a great extent 
as to the amount of fat present in the flesh. The whitings, tur- 
bot, sole, white fish, pike, flounder, halibut, haddock, contain 
less fat than salmon, mackerel, sturgeon, eels or shad. The 
herring is a fish almost by itself ; it contains much more fat '*in 
season" than when it is ''out of season." Sturgeon contains 
the greatest amount of fat ; salmon perhaps ranks second. 

Dried meats are those that have parted with most of their 
natural water. In this condition they are said to be "pre- 
served," and, if protected from the air, will keep a long time. 
They consist principally of nitrogenous materials known as 
myosin, fibrin, albumin, gelatin and fat, the proportion of which 
is variable. All albuminous or nitrogenous foods are more 
easily digested uncooked; but cooking becomes necessary to 
remove the danger of disease germs ; hence it is desirable that 
meat shall be thoroughly heated. The American fashion of 
serving meat "rare" or in a rather purple condition, is certainly 
objectionable. A rule to be remembered is that all white meats 
must be thoroughly cooked. Red meats may be served a little 
underdone. This does not mean that the blood must run from 
them as they are carved, but that they must be pink, juicy and 
tender. Veal, lamb and young chicken require a greater time 
for digestion than mature animals of the same kind. Of these, 
lamb and young chicken are perhaps least objectionable. 

TABLE OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSES 

In summing up, consider the comparative analyses of meats in 
common use. It will be noticed that the water decreases as the 
fat in the meat increases ; and that in some cases, in the same 
animal, it affects also the mineral matter or salts. For instance, 
in lean mutton, the mineral matter is 4.8; in fat mutton, 3.5. 

When meat is recommended as an article of diet, it must 
form only one-fifth, at most one-fourth, of a well-balanced 
dietary. We have simply recommended it as a better form of 
nitrogenous food for persons of sedentary habits than a purely 
vegetable diet. These analyses have been taken from various 
books of reference, Yeo, Pavy, Church and Letherby.

TABLE OF COMPARATIVE DIGESTIBILITY 

in ordinarily healthy persons, all foods under consideration 
having been cooked and moderately seasoned. 

It v^ill be readily understood that seasoning and cooking 
play an important part in the digestibility of foods. Foods 
over-seasoned irritate the stomach. The albuminoids, proteids 
or nitrogenous foods, lean meats, of which we are now speak- 
ing, all require a greater length of time for digestion when 
cooked. Cooked, however, they must be, to remove the danger 
of disease germs. In comparison, it is best to consider first the 
given time for digesting these materials raw; then we see 
whether or not cooking aids in their digestibility. For instance, 
raw beef and mutton require two hours for perfect digestion; 
veal, two and a half hours ; pork, three hours ; oysters, three 
hours ; raw egg whipped, one and a half hours ; raw egg, as it 
comes from the shell fresh, two hours.

BEEF 

Beef should be fine grained, the outside, that portion exposed 
to the air, a Hght red, showing a shade of purple when the first 
slice is cut off ; the lean mottled with fat ; the fat solid, and yel- 
lowish white. Avoid beef with yellow fat ; it usually denotes an 
old and ill-fed animal. The lean flesh of such meat is tough, 
rich in water, and is rarely palatable even when carefully 
cooked. A *'spayed" heifer from four to six years of age gives 
the very finest of beef. Second comes the steer or bullock 
which has been allowed to remain in our western fields until 
four or five years old, then quickly fattened and killed while 
in a perfectly healthy condition. The working ox, cow and bull 
do not give us choice meat. In the first, the muscles have been 
hardened by work, making a coarse grained flesh, ligaments 
and muscle, weighing less than good beef according to the 
amount of bones. A cow, as a rule, is not sold for beef until she 
is too old to milk ; hence the flesh is shriveled, tough and unpala- 
table. The flesh of a bull is usually dark in color, tough and 
stringy, while the fat is strong in flavor and golden in color. 

Animals whose flesh is to be used as food for man should 
be carefully fed and properly killed ; the flesh put at once into 
cold storage and *'hung" until the rigor mortis has passed. It 
is a well known fact that immediately after death the muscles 
become rigid and tense, a condition due to the spontaneous 
coagulation of the myosin of the muscular fibrin. Its duration 
varies greatly in different animals and under different condi- 
tions ; do not eat the flesh of animals until this has passed away. 
"Hang" all animals and birds. Use fish as soon as they come 
from the water. 

It was supposed, in the earlier days, that mutton required a 
longer "hang-ing" time than beef, game still longer and that 
poultry might with impunity be used the same day on which it 
was killed. After experimenting carefully, we find that barn 
yard fowls require hanging from twenty-four to thirty hours. 
If an animal is cooked before rigor mortis has "set in," it may 
possibly be tender, but certainly has a very unpleasant flavor. 
In very warm countries, however, where meat cannot be kept

more than two or three hours, immediate cooking is necessary. 
Such meats are usually wrapped in paw-paw leaves, which 
partly digest and soften the fibre. 

Of the several desirable methods of cooking beef, roasting, 
grilling, or broiling best preserves the juices and develops the 
flavor. Roasting, grilling or broiling means to expose one side 
of the meat to a hot fire while the other is toward the fresh, 
cold air. Our forefathers roasted and broiled meat before an 
open fire. The beef of old England is still roasted, but in this 
country we almost invariably bake rather than ''roast." It 
requires less attention and is more convenient. No matter in 
what way the meat is cooked, the object is the same — to thor- 
oughly cook and at the same time retain the juices, and make 
the meat tender and well flavored. By exposing the meat to an 
intense heat, the juices on the outside are coagulated, forming a 
covering or crust which prevents the further escape of the 
juice, and retains the flavor of the meat. If properly cooked, a 
piece of beef may be well done and still juicy. Dry meat is 
always the result of poor cooking. 

Different pieces of meat require different methods of cook- 
ing to bring about the best results. For instance, parts of the 
animal toughened by use or motion, as the round and shoulder, 
require moist heat to soften the fibre and connective tissue. It 
would be very unwise and extravagant to purchase the same 
sort of meat for roasting that one would use for stewing. 

The diagram has been marked by one of the leading 
butchers in Philadelphia. The division will not, of course, 
correspond to the cutting in all cities of the United States, but 
will give the housewife a very good idea of the general division 
of beef. In the west, the animal is divided into halves at the 
first rib, one long standing rib being taken off with the hind 
quarter. This is well for the butcher, but bad for the house- 
wife. In Boston, the division is just a little different from that 
in New York and Philadelphia. By a careful study of the 
whole animal (for the animals that go to Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia and the west have the same number of ribs), one 
will get a closer idea of the different conditions of meat in the 
various parts of the animal. 



142 

For moist cookery such as stews, en casserole, or in any 
fashion where water is used, select the round (19J, either 
upper or under. For boihng, bolar (12) or round (19) or the 
veiny piece of the rump (18). The flank steak (16) for rolled 
steak, mock fillet, steak a la Flamande or beefsteak pie. For 
the cheap stews, 13 and 18. For beef a la mode in a large fam- 
ily, a thick slice of the round (19) is usually selected. In a 
smaller family the bolar piece (12) is more desirable. In 
markets where the upper and under round are sold divided, 
the under round is chosen for a small family, although the 
upper is more tender, but a good slice would be too heavy. For 
soups or stock the shin and leg are best. The shin being 
smaller, requires but five quarts of cold water, while the leg 
requires seven, so the difference in price is due to the difference 
in size, one being as good as the other. The sticking piece (2) 
naturally contains more nourishment than almost any other 
part of the animal, as at this place the animal is bled ; hence this 
piece is best for beef tea, beef extract, mince meat and beef 
loaf. The ox cheek ( i ) is not used to any great extent in this 
country; but in England it gives to the laboring man many a 
good dinner. It is cheap and nutritious, good boiled and served 
with vegetables. The neck (3) may also be used for stewing or 
braising with vegetables, but as one must take a large amount 
of bone with little lean beef it is extravagant for a small family, 
and is only good where long, slow cooking is employed, as in 
soups or stews. The second and third chucks (4) are used for 
roasting or baking. This, however, would be economical only 
in an exceedingly large family, as one must take a tremendous 
weight to get the thickness necessary for a good roast. This is 
also true of 5. The standing ribs are 6, 7 and 8. These 
differ from the chuck ribs in that they have more compact 
flesh. You will notice in 5 a little piece of cartilage coming 
near the edge of the meat, separating a thin outside layer from 
the main portion of the meat. As you go on into 4, this carti- 
lage is hardened into bone and forms a portion of the shoulder 
blade. For this reason the chuck ribs are cheaper than stand- 
ing ribs, although the meat is desirable and perhaps just as 
tender. Standing ribs carve to greater advantage. For a large 



i 



MEATS 



143 



family, 7 would be the desirable cut. For a small family 8 ; the 
meat is more compact and weight less for the size; two ribs 
make an exceedingly nice roast weighing from five to six 
pounds. If the butcher tops after weighing it, have him send 
the "top" home to use for deviled ribs or a braise, two of the 
nicest of the cheap dishes. Fifteen represents the loin, the 
choice, tender part of the animal. It must be borne in mind 
that an animal weighing eight hundred to a thousand pounds 
when dressed, will yield only about fifty pounds of loin, rarely 
ever more than sixty, hence this portion is very high in price. 
On the under side is the fillet or tenderloin, tender because it is 
shielded by the backbone on top, the mass of kidney fat under- 
neath. The meat is without exercise, the muscles are soft, 
hence we have '^ tenderloin/' The outside nearest the skin gives 
us the "sirloin" steak served at the average first-class hotel, 
and to which we frequently refer as the "back" of the loin. 
From the loin we get our "porterhouse" or "sirloin" steaks. 
In Philadelphia 17 is the rump, in New York the sirloin ; it con- 
tains desirable steaks for broiling. The aitch or pin bone (22) 
is a desirable roast in a large family, the proportion of bone 
to meat being always the same, makes it an extravagant 
"small" roast. The plate (9) and the brisket (10) are best 
for corning, as here we get the "streak of fat" and a "streak of 
lean," always desirable in boiled corn beef. The butt end of the 
shoulder and the butt end of the brisket or clod (11 and 13) 
are not desirable pieces, but may be used for stews and soups. 



TO ROAST 

To roast meat place the joint on a hook in a tin kitchen in front 
of an open fire. In Philadelphia and other cities where 
bricked-in ranges are used, the large front door is dropped. 
The fire must be clear and red. Or it may be hung in front of 
a wood fire, or in front of a charcoal fire, or better still in the 
underneath, or broiling chamber of a gas stove. Beef cannot 
be roasted in the oven of a coal stove unless it has a gauze door. 
We bake in an "oven." The fire must be clear and hot at first 
to sear the outside quickly ; then lower the temperature to 300° 



144 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Fahr. ; cook for fifteen minutes to each pound. The time varies 
where the roast is small. A five-pound roast will be put before 
the fire at a temperature of about 400° Fahr., turned until the 
outside is quickly seared, the temperature then reduced to 300° 
Fahr. Roast for one hour. It takes longer accordingly for a 
large roast, as it is more difficult for the heat to penetrate to the 
very centre. Add salt when the meat is nearly done ; never add 
it at first; as it draws out the juices and toughens the meat. 
This you may prove by experiment. Put a piece of meat on a 
plate and sprinkle it thickly with salt. Put an unsalted piece 
on another plate and stand them both in a dry place for an 
hour. It will be noticed that the plate holding the salted meat 
is filled with the juices of the meat, while the other plate is 
comparatively dry. Sear the outside of meat previous to the 
salting. As the fat begins to melt and drip, catch it in a drip- 
ping pan and baste it frequently over the meat. This also helps 
to close the pores on the outside and makes the meat juicy and 
tender. Do not baste with water, as it softens the outside, 
allowing the juices to escape. 



TO ROAST IN A GAS STOVE 

Light the oven burners five minutes before putting in the meat. 
Place the broiling rack with its pan underneath as near the floor 
of the stove as possible. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, 
draw out the pan, place the meat flesh side up. As soon as this 
is brown and is nicely seared, turn, sear on the other side, and 
continue until the whole outside has been thoroughly seared. 
Now turn down the lights to the minimum and roast fifteen 
minutes to each pound, turning and basting every ten minutes. 
If you have a gauze door at the bottom of your gas stove close 
it, otherwise leave the door partly open or the oven may become 
too hot ; there is danger of the fat catching fire. When partly 
done dust the fleshy portion with salt and pepper, and baste 
immediately. If the oven seems too hot as the roasting goes 
on, turn out the back burner ; you will have sufficient heat to 
finish. 




Roasting in a Gauze Door Oven Page 145 



MEATS 145 

TO ROAST IN GAUZE DOOR OVEN 

I 'lace the meat on the rack. Put a pan underneath to catch the 
dripping. Sear quickly at 400° Fahr., and then cook slowly 
at 240° Fahr., basting frequently. Dust with salt and pepper 
when partly done. If you have an oven without the rack, pro- 
ceed precisely the same as when baking in an ordinary oven. 
The meat will, however, be roasted, as the gauze door will 
allow a current of fresh air to pass through without chilling 
the oven. 

TO BAKE BEEF 

Under all circumstances, no matter vv^hether with gas, wood, 
coal, or oil, the oven must be heated to at least 400° Fahr. before 
])utting in the meat. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, place it 
in a shallow baking pan, bone side down ; dust it lightly with 
'c'pper. Put a teaspoonful of salt in one corner of the pan, and 
iifficient water to just cover the bottom. This will prevent 
I he scorching of the pan while the meat is searing, and will 
( vaporate in a few minutes. As soon as the meat is thoroughly 
rriisted, close the drafts of the stove, cooling off the oven to 
240° Fahr. Baste the meat at once, and every ten minutes 
during the baking, which will be fifteen minutes to each pound. 
In about a half hour the bottom of the pan will be covered with 
melted fat ; use this for basting ; do not add more water. If the 
meat is lean and without fat, it is better to baste it with two or 
three tablespoonfuls of extra fat or dripping which you have 
saved. When the meat is done, dish it on a hot platter; pour 
from the pan all the fat, with the exception of four tablespoon- 
fuls, keeping the brown sediment in the pan. To this add two 
rounding tablespoonfuls of flour; mix until smooth and add 
hastily a pint of stock or water. Put the pan over the fire, and 
stir constantly until the mixture boils ; add a half teaspoonful 
of salt, a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet and a half saltspoonful 
of pepper. Strain into the gravy boat, and send at once to the 
table. This sauce will be a rich, dark brown, perfectly free from 
floating fat. The method of baking is precisely the same, no 
matter what sort of stove is used. 

A gas oven should be lighted from eight to ten minutes 
10 



146 

before placing the meat; the oil stove oven, equally long. 
Place the meat on the rack at least four inches from the bottom 
of the oven in the two latter stoves. Take notice that you are to 
baste the meat with the fat that melts and drips to the bottom of 
the pan, which is usually called dripping. Do not add water to 
the pan from time to time, as it softens the outside, allowing the 
juices to escape. The best piece of meat from a selected animal, 
put into a pan with water, covered and put into a moderately 
heated oven, will be tasteless, dry and stringy. Do not bake or 
roast tough or inferior pieces; use them for braising, where 
water can be used. Pork and veal must be baked much longer 
than beef, mutton or poultry. 

I observe that country people depend largely upon pork for 
their meat, and really prefer it, as it has more flavor. This is 
true according to the common methods of cooking. Pork will 
stand long cooking in a slow heat, while beef, to be good, must 
be quickly seared and cooked without water. Slow cooking 
intensifies the flavor of pork and entirely destroys the flavor of 
beef. 



BOILED BEEF 

For this use a brisket, the bolar piece or round. Put the trim- 
mings and suet of the meat into a large kettle ; when the fat has 
tried out, throw in the meat and turn it quickly until the outside 
is thoroughly seared. Remove the crackling from the fat, and 
cover the meat with boiling water, bring quickly to boiling 
point and boil rapidly for five minutes. Push it on the back 
part of the stove where it cannot again possibly boil, but will 
simmer at i6o° Fahr. — fifteen minutes to each pound of meat. 
One hour before the meat is done, add a tablespoonful of salt 
and a saltspoonful of pepper. When done, dish, garnish with 
cress or carefully boiled cabbage, and send at once to the table. 
The liquor in which the meat was boiled may be saved for 
stock, or a portion of it made into brown sauce to serve with 
the meat. 

Cold, boiled beef may be served plain, cut into thin slices, 
or made into boudins, croquettes, cecils or meat apd potato roll 



MEATS 147 

BRAISED BEEF 

Trim and tie into shape the bolar piece or a thick slice from the 
under round. Cover the bottom of your braising pan (a double 
"roasting" pan) with finely chopped onion, put on top the beef, 
add two bay leaves, a bunch of pot-herbs. Add a quart of good 
stock or water ; cover the pan, put it into a quick oven until the 
meat has browned — about one hour. Then reduce the tempera- 
ture of the oven and cook slowly for four hours. Serve this 
with a brown sauce made from the stock in the pan. This may 
also be cooked without the vegetables, seasoned with salt and 
pepper. 



BEEF a la MODE 

Beef a la mode is simply braised meat that has been highly 
spiced. The day before you are going to cook the beef, rub it 
thoroughly with a mixture of a half teaspoonful of cloves, a 
teaspoonful of ginger, a half teaspoonful of allspice, the same 
of cinnamon, the same of white pepper. Sprinkle the beef over 
with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and stand it aside over 
night. Next day cover the bottom of a braising pan thickly 
with chopped onion and carrot, put on top the beef, add celery 
seed, bay leaf and two quarts of good stock. Water may be 
used, but is never so nice. Add a calf's foot that has been 
carefully cracked, or two tablespoonfuls of gelatin that have 
been soaked in cold water for a half hour. Cover the pan, 
put it into a quick oven, and when the meat has slightly 
browned, reduce the temperature of the oven to about 212° 
Fahr. Cook the meat slowly for four hours, basting fre- 
quently. Serve with a brown sauce made from the stock in 
the pan. 

That which is left over will be cut into thin slices and 
served cold, garnished with aspic jelly and either chopped 
tomato or cream horseradish sauce. 

Beef a la mode is exceedingly nice warm weather meat, as 
the spices prevent it from decomposing and will keep in a per- 
fectly fresh condition in a good refrigerator for one week. 



148 

TO BROIL STEAK 

For broiling, select either a sirloin, porterhouse, or rump steak 
at least two inches thick. The first two are much the same, 
differing only in size. Trim off a portion of the suet, scrape the 
outside fat, and just cut through the "skin" here and there to 
prevent shrinking. Do not moisten the steak; it is not neces- 
sary to even wipe it with a damp cloth, as it has just been cut 
from the fresh piece of beef. 

OVER A COAL FIRE 

See that the fire is perfectly free from gas, the coals bright and 
red. Open the draft at the bottom of the fire box and remove 
the top lids on the front of the stove. Put the steak in a wire 
broiler, fasten and place it near the fire; sear quickly on one 
side, turn and sear it on the other; and turn it each twenty 
seconds for three minutes. Lift the steak now at least six 
mches from the fire; cook slowly for five minutes on one side, 
turn and cook five minutes on the other. A broiler rack or 
holder will enable one now to leave the steak for a few minutes, 
fiave on the back part of the stove an iron platter or some 
ordinary dish ready to receive the steak. In this dish put a 
tablespoonful of butter, a half teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoon- 
ful of pepper, and if you like rub the bottom of the dish with 
a clove of garlic. Lift the hot steak immediately to this dish, 
baste it well with the seasoning. Have ready heated the serving 
platter; lift the steak carefully to the centre of the serving 
platter, and pour over the butter and seasoning that is left 
in the first dish. Garnish with two thin slices of lemon that 
have been covered with finely chopped parsley, or cress and 
potato balls, or it may be served plain. Send at once to the 
table. A steak two inches in thickness will require twenty 
minutes for broiling; one and a half inches, twelve minutes; 
one inch, ten minutes. A steak thinner than this, will not give 
good results. 

TO BROIL WITH GAS 

Light the oven five minutes before placing the steak. See that 
the broiling pan and rack are underneath in their proper places. 
Prepare the steak as directed in preceding recipe. When the 



MEATS 149 

broiler is hot draw it out ; place the steak ; put it as near the gas 
flame as possible, without its touching. As soon as the steak is 
seared carefully and thoroughly on one side, draw out the pan 
and with a fork, sticking it as near the edge as possible, turn 
and sear the other side. Turn the steak again. Lower the pan 
now about six inches from the burners, turn them half way 
down, broil slowly for five minutes, turn and broil five minutes 
on the other side. Season and serve precisely the same as in 
preceding recipe. 

A steak carefully broiled under a gas flame is to my mind a 
steak cooked to perfection. 

TO BROIL WITH AN OIL STOVE 

Here the operation is entirely different, and is more like the pan 
broil than in the preceding cases. The steak, of course, has not 
the same fine flavor, but it is tlie best we can do with an oil 
stove. Put over one of the top burners a large iron spider or 
baking pan. Prepare the steak the same as for broiling over 
coal or gas. When the pan has reached almost a white heat, 
rub it quickly with a piece of suet and throw in the steak. As 
soon as it has seared carefully on this side, turn it on the other. 
When seared, turn it backwards and forwards almost con- 
stantly (always sticking the fork in the skin or near the bone, 
otherwise the juice will escape) for five minutes, during which 
time you have had the oven lighted and heating. The oven is 
now very hot; run the steak at once into the oven as near the 
bottom as possible ; allow it to cook five minutes, or less, 
according to the thickness ; draw it out, turn, and cook five 
minutes longer. Season and serve the same as in preceding 
recipe. 

OVEJl CHARCOAL 

In many parts of the central west, where wood i$ used entirely 
for cooking purposes, broiling is most easily done. It is a well- 
known fact that steak is sweeter and better broiled over char- 
coal than with any other fuel, save gas. Half fill the fire box 
with crood hard wood. When the wood is well lighted and 
mostly burned to the centre, check the draft so as to form char- 
coal at red heat. Then open the drafts of the stove, remove 



150 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

the lids and broil precisely the same as you would over a coal 
fire. If your stove has a hearth in front, the coals may be 
drawn out into the hearth and the broiling done there. In this 
way you do not interfere with the fire ; cooking may go on the 
same as though you were not broiling. 

TO PAN BROIL 

Persons doing light housekeeping use frequently a "flat top" 
gas stove, or a small wood, oil or coal stove which will not 
allow the removing of the lids; pan broiling then is the next 
best method of cooking a steak. Put a cast iron pan over the 
fire until it is very hot. Rub it lightly with a piece of suet and 
put in the steak. When seared on one side, turn and sear on 
the other, and turn constantly until the meat is done. For this 
we prefer a steak not over one inch in thickness. Five to seven 
minutes will be sufficient for cooking. If you allow it to remain 
on one side any length of time, the fat will melt and the steak 
will be fried rather than broiled. We do not fry steaks in this 
the twentieth century ; we have learned better. Dish the steak ; 
dust it lightly with salt and pepper. Into the pan in which it 
was cooked, put a tablespoonful of butter or suet and a table- 
spoonful of flour; mix carefully; add a half pint of stock or 
water, stir until boiling, and add a half teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of white pepper, a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, 
and pour it over the steak. Or you may simply add to the pan 
in which it was cooked four tablespoonfuls of stock ; stir over 
the fire, getting all the browning from the bottom of the pan, 
and pour it over the meat ; or, it may be served the same as a 
broiled steak.

butter cannot possibly brown until the mushrooms are tender. 
i\ish them to one side of the pan ; add the flour to the butter ; 
mix until smooth ; add the stock. When boiling, add the salt, 
pepper, kitchen bouquet, and stand over hot water while you 
broil the steak. The marrow bones will have been boiled the 
day before, the marrow shaken out and cut into slices. Place 
these on a dish and stand in the oven or over hot water. As 
soon as the steak is broiled, lift it to the serving dish, dust 
lightly with salt and pepper, and cover it with the slices 
of marrow. Arrange the mushrooms in the centre and around 
the steak ; strain over the sauce. Garnish the dish with parsley 
and send at once to the table, 

STEAK WITH FRESH MUSHROOM SAUCE 

Wash and cut into quarters a half-pound of fresh mushrooms. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan; add the 
mushrooms and sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoon- 
ful of pepper. Cover the saucepan, and cook slowly on the back 
part of the stove for twenty minutes. Do not lift the lid more 
than once during this time or the flavor of the mushrooms will 
escape. Put one tablespoonful of flour into a bowl, add gradu- 
ally a little cold milk or stock. When perfectly smooth, add a 
half cup of stock or milk ; strain this into the mushrooms ; stir 
until boiling, and take from the fire ; add a half tablespoonful 
of butter, and pour over the steak, which will have been broil- 
ing- during this time. Try to have both done at the same time. 
The sauce, however, can wait with less injury than the steak. 

STEAK WITH CANNED MUSHROOMS 

Put one tablespoonful of butter and one of flour into a sauce- 
pan ; mix ; add a half pint of stock ; stir until it reaches the boil- 
ing point ; add a half teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of 
kitchen bouquet, a saltspoonful of pepper, a tablespoonful of 
mushroom catsup and a half can of mushrooms. Stand these 
over hot water while you broil the steak. As soon as the steak 
is dished, pour over the sauce, garnish the dish with potato 
balls and parsley, and send at once to the table.

STEAK WITH OYSTERS 

Select twenty-five oysters; drain, wash and drain again. Trim 
the steak, which should be about an inch and a half in thick- 
ness. When the steak has broiled for five minutes, dust with 
salt and pepper, baste with butter, and cover it over with the 
oysters, and without delay run it into a very hot oven for ten 
minutes. Dish without removing the oysters, baste thoroughly 
with the juice that is in the bottom of the pan, and send at once 
to the table. The oysters should have the gills thoroughly 
curled and be slightly browned. 

STEAK WITH ONIONS 

Cut into thin slices Bermuda, Spanish, or the ordinary brown 
skinned onions. Separate the slices into the natural rings. 
Have ready a kettle of hot fat. Put a few of the onions at a 
time in a frying basket ; plunge them into the hot fat and sort 
of lift the basket up and down until the onions are crisp and 
brown. Throw them into a colander, dust lightly with salt, 
and stand in the oven to drain while you broil the steak. In 
fact, if you are an expert cook you will manage both onions 
and steak at the same time. When the steak is broiled, dish, 
dust with salt and pepper, put over a little butter and heap over 
the fried onions. The onions must be dry and crisp. 

STEAK WITH ONIONS (GERMAN FASHION) 

Slice the onions and separate them as in preceding recipe ; cover 
with boiling water, add a teaspoonful of salt and cook slowly 
for twenty minutes, and drain. When perfectly dry throw 
Ihem into a hot saucepan. When they have lost a portion of 
the water, add a tablespoonful of butter, stir the onions in this 
butter until they are slightly brown, and stand them aside while 
you broil the steak. When the steak is broiled, season, cover it 
over with the onions, and send at once to the table. 

STEAK en CASSEROLE 

For this select a round steak. The round, on account of the 
development of the muscle, cannot be broiled and served to

good advantage, as It is tough and difficult of mastication. It 
is one of the pieces best adapted to moist heat. Have the steak 
cut at least one inch thick, then into pieces two inches square. 
To each two pounds of steak allow 
Yz pint of small white onions i turnip 
I tablespoonful of chopped i saltspoonful of celery seed 

parsley i teaspoonful of salt 

I good-sized carrot i saltspoonful of pepper 

Peel the onion, cut the carrot and turnip into fancy shapes or 
they may be cut into dice. In the bottom of the casserole dish 
put a layer of mixed vegetables. Put an iron pan over the fire 
to heat. When hot, rub the bottom with suet as you would for 
pan broiling, throw in the bits of steak, sear them quickly on 
both sides, lift and put them into the casserole mold, on top of 
the layer of vegetables, cover over all the remaining vegetables, 
add all the seasonings and a pint of boiling stock. Cover the 
dish and stand it in a quick oven to bake for one hour. Steak 
en casserole is served in the dish in which it is cooked. The 
steak will be brown and tender, the vegetables slightly brown 
and the stock nearly absorbed. You may, if you like, add 
kitchen bouquet to the stock ; it aids in the browning of the 
vegetables and adds to the flavoring. Some housewives are 
sufficiently unwise to use for this dish slices of fillet ; it is, how- 
ever, a great extravagance, as the round is much lower in price, 
and gives excellent results.

wet. Knead for a moment, and roll out in a sheet sufficiently 
large to cover the baking dish. Over the meat pour the stock 
which by this time has reached the boiling point ; place on top 
the crust, making an opening in the centre. Brush with milk 
or beaten egg, and bake in a moderate oven one and a quarter 
hours. Many English cooks prefer to make a brown sauce 
instead of adding the stock. This is done by mixing a table- 
spoonful of butter and one of flour, adding the hot stock and a 
teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet. Use in the place of the plain 
stock. 

ROUND STEAK WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Make the sauce according to the recipe given, and stand it 
over hot water while the steak is being cooked. Select the 
upper tender portion of the round, have it cut one inch in thick- 
ness, and pan it according to the directions given, or it may 
be broiled over a very quick fire. Dish, pour over the tomato 
sauce, and serve at once. 

Caution. — Round steak must go to the table and be carved 
while it is still very hot. Many tender steaks may be placed in 
the oven just a moment, but a round steak becomes tough if 
chilled, or allowed to stand even five minutes. 

STEAK a la FLAMANDE 

Select a flank or "skirt" steak, or a slice from the upper por- 
tion of the round. Chop one good-sized onion and a table- 
spoonful of parsley ; mix together a teaspoonful of salt and a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Sprinkle the bottom of the baking pan 
with a little of the onion, place on top the trimmed steak, brush 
it with an egg slightly beaten with a tablespoonful of warm 
water, and then put over the remaining portion of onion and 
parsley. Add a half cup of stock, to which you have added the 
salt and pepper. Run this into a very quick oven, and cook for 
thirty minutes. Dish the steak. Put into the pan a tablespoon- 
ful of butter and one of flour rubbed together ; add half cup of 
stock, bring to boiling point, add a teaspoonful of kitchen bou- 
quet and strain over the steak. This may be garnished with 



MEATS

cress, cooked carrots, or carrots and turnips mixed, or you may 
use a mixture of vegetables that have been left over from the 
previous day ; simply heat and place them as a garnish around 
the steak before pouring over the sauce. 



STUFFED STEAK 

Purchase a slice a half inch thick from the upper round ; cut it 
into halves crosswise. Over the lower half sprinkle finely 
chopped parsley, a dusting of pepper and here and there a half 
teaspoonful of butter. Chop very fine a quarter of a pound of 
cold boiled tongue, and place it in the centre of the steak. Put 
on top of this the other half; fasten together by deep stitches 
all around the edge ; use a trussing or darning needle. Cover 
the top thickly with chopped onion, and place the steak in a 
baking pan. Put in the pan a half cup of water or stock and 
the bits of suet that were trimmed from the steak. Bake in a 
quick oven three-quarters of an hour, basting three or four 
times ; sprinkle over a half teaspoonful of salt at the last bast- 
ing. When done, dish carefully, remove the strings, and pour 
over a brown sauce made in the pan.

Roll the steak the long way, tying or stitching to keep it in 
shape. Place it in the baking pan, add the stock and all the 
seasoning. Bake in a very quick oven three-quarters of an 
hour, basting every ten minutes. When done dish and remove 
the string. Rub the butter and flour together; put it into the

Gpoonful of salt ; a dash of pepper, and sufficient melted butter 
(extra) to moisten. Spread each slice with bread crumbs, roll 
them up compactly and tie with twine. Put the butter and 
flour into a saucepan, mix, add the stock ; when boiling add the 
kitchen bouquet and the ''olives, " as they are now called. Bring 
this to boiling point ; push it on the back part of the stove where 
it will simmer gently for one hour ; then add the salt and pep- 
per, and if you like, a bay leaf and a tablespoonful of chopped 
onion; cook slowly thirty minutes longer. When ready to 
serve, heap in the centre of the platter a mound of either 
mashed potatoes or boiled rice. Put the olives around as a 
garnish and fill the bottom of the dish with the strained brown 
sauce. Send it at once to the table. Be careful to remove the 
strings.

steaks, being careful to have them of even thickness. Place 
these on the broiler, broil over a slow fire for ten minutes. 
It takes longer to broil a Hamburg steak one inch thick than 
it does an ordinary steak of the same thickness. Dish on a

I pint of stock

2 pounds of beef 
2 tablespoonfuls of flour 
I teaspoonful of kitchen bou- 
quet 
I small carrot 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Before beginning, take into consideration that seasonings play 
an important part in the recipe, but are by no means arbitrary. 
If the kitchen is without bay leaves (I hope it is not, as they are 
cheap and accessible), do without them. If you are without 
onion, or you have a particular dislike to onion, leave it out : 
it plays no part in the making of the recipe. The butter, flour, 
liquid and meat must be kept in the proportions given. 

Cut the meat into cubes of one inch ; roll them in one table- 
spoonful of flour. Put the suet into the saucepan ; shake it over 
the fire until it is well melted. Remove the crackling and throw 
in the meat; shake until it has slightly browned or until the 
outside of each piece is thoroughly seared to retain the 
juices. Draw the meat to one side of the saucepan ; add the 
other tablespoon ful of flour to the fat in the bottom of the 
pan ; mix and add the stock. Stir this until boiling; add all the 
seasoning, cover the pan and stand it where it will simmer

is tender. Ten minutes before serving make the 

DUMPLINGS 

Put into a bowl one pint of flour with which you have sifted a 
rounding teaspoonful of baking powder and a half teaspoonful 
of salt ; add about two-thirds of a cup of milk. Take the bowl 
and a teaspoon to the side of the fire and drop the mixture all 
over the top of the stew by teaspoon fuls. Cover the saucepan 
and cook slowly for ten minutes without lifting the lid. Dish 
by putting the dumplings around the edge of the platter; the 
stew in the centre, straining over the sauce; dust with a little 
chopped parsley, and send at once to the table. 

This stew may be varied by using strained tomato in the 
place of stock. Water may be added in the place of stock, but 
the stew will be of inferior quality.

they may be put in at the last moment. Slice the onions, 
put them in with the meat, add the bay leaf and all the other 
seasonings. Cover and simmer gently one hour longer. A 
half-hour before serving time strain the soup, take out the meat,

ful of kitchen bouquet. Add to this all the vegetables that have 
been strained from the soup ; stand the mixture over hot water 
until wanted. The soup will be seasoned and served either 
plain or with croutons as soup at the beginning" of the dinner. 
Dish the meat in the centre of a large platter ; put the vegetables 
at the ends of the platter, heaping them towards the meat. Pour 
over the sauce. Serve with this boiled rice or plain boiled 
potatoes. 



MUTTON 

Mutton, like beef, is divided first into halves; then each half 
into hind and fore quarters. The hind quarter is sub-divided 
into a leg and loin, and the fore quarter into head, neck, 
shoulder, rack and breast. The saddle of mutton comprises the 
two loins cut from the dividing line between 4 and 6 back to 
the rump. It embraces the whole upper back portion of the 
sheep and is considered the most elegant of roasts. Mutton is 
much better if *'hung" at least ten days. In the winter this can 
be done in any cool, dry place; in the summer it must be in 
''cold storage" or a refrigerator. The flesh of good mutton 
should be bright red in color, with fat firm and white ; and the 
fatter the mutton the more tender the leaner parts. Good 
Southdown mutton is considered the best. For baking or 
roasting select the saddle, or the rack, 4, or loin, 6, or 
shoulder, 3, or the leg, 8. The best cooks, however, agree that 
the leg and shoulder are spoiled when not boiled. The neck 
makes the best and the cheapest piece for stewing, pillau and 
broths of all kinds. The head may be used the same as a calf's 
head for soups and stews and is always one of the ingredients 
in haggis. 

French chops are taken from rack, 4. 

Loin chops come from 6. Both of these are broiled. 

For plain boiling, the leg is first choice, the shoulder the 
second. Many epicures, however, prefer the shoulder to 
the leg.

MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



The feet or legs of the sheep from the upper part of the 
hoof to the knee joints are known as the ''sheep's trotters," and 
are used for jelHes and pickHng, "soused." 

LAMB 

Lamb is the young of mutton. Spring lamb being much 
smaller than mutton is divided into halves and quarters only, 
and is sold and cooked in these quantities. The ''fore" quarter 
is considered the better. The very early lamb is called "house 
lamb." The "lamb chops" sold in our markets are chops from 
young sheep, sometimes from small thin mutton, not spring 
lamb. Serve with lamb, mint sauce, peas, asparagus and new 
potatoes with cream sauce. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON 

Select a good-sized leg of mutton — small legs are not good. 
Wipe with a damp cloth. Plunge it into a kettle of boiling 
water, and boil rapidly for five minutes, then push it on the 
back part of the stove where it will simmer at i8o° Fahr. 
for twenty minutes to each pound. When done dish, trimming 
with a quilling of paper, garnish with cress or parsley and serve 
with caper sauce in a boat. Serve also with this plain boiled 
rice and stewed turnips, or peas, or asparagus tips, or cauli- 
flower. A boiled leg of mutton may also be garnished with 
suet dumplings.

vegetable hash. 



TO PRESERVE MUTTON HAMS OR LEGS 

Select fine large legs, wipe them with a damp cloth and then 
with a dry, clean towel. Allow to each leg weighing about ten 
pounds one-half pound of good salt, one ounce of saltpetre, 
a half pound of brown sugar. Mix these together, holding 
the vessel over a kettle of hot water. Arrange the legs on a 
board in the cellar, tipping it just a little. Rub the meat all 
over with this mixture, allow it to stand for two or three days, 
turning and rubbing each day. The mixture will be sufficient 
for three or four rubbings for six legs. Now make another 
mixture, allowing to each leg a half pound of brown sugar, a 
half pound of salt, one ounce of ground cloves. Hold this 
mixture over the fire just a moment. Wipe the legs with a dry 
cloth, then rub them with the second mixture. Have ready a 
perfectly clean tub ; put the legs into it, cover and for two 
weeks turn and baste them several times with the liquor that 
has formed in the tub. They may now be smoked the same as 
ordinary hams, put into bags and hung in a cool, dry place. 
To cook, boil, or chip and frizzle the same as dried beef. 



CROWN ROAST 

This is made from the entire "rack" of mutton. The upper 
portions of the bones are trimmed, and the joints and meat cut 
through only to the skin. The roast is then folded inside out, 
as it were, and fastened together. Cover the tops of the bones 
with a piece of folded, oiled paper. Stand the roast in a baking 
pan. Dissolve a half teaspoonful of salt in a half cup of water. 
Add this to the pan and bake in a quick oven three-quarters of 
an hour, basting frequently. While this is roasting, boil and 
mash six good-sized potatoes. Beat until very light. Dish the 
roast, remove the strings and the pa])er. Fill the centre with 
mashed potatoes, garnish the outside witli nicely cooked green

peas. Cover each bone with a Httle quill of paper and send al 
once to the table. 

For a large family or a large number of people two racks 
may be fastened to form one roast. 

BOILED SHOULDER OF MUTTON 

This may be boiled precisely the same as the leg. Serve with 
cream sauce. It may also be stuffed with pifion nuts ; take out 
the bone and boil fifteen minutes longer. Serve with boiled 
shoulder, boiled rice, baked tomatoes, peas, cauliflower, spinach 
or stewed turnips.

6 medium-sized potatoes i saltspoonful of pepper 

2 good-sized onions. 

Wipe the shoulder, place it in a baking pan; dust with pepper ; 
put around it the potatoes, peeled. Put in the bottom of the 
pan one-half pint of water. Run it in a quick oven, and when 
it is nicely browned reduce the heat of the oven to 240° Fahr. 
Sprinkle the potatoes and meat with the salt, cook slowly for 
one hour, basting frequently with the fat in the bottom of the 
pan. When done dish the mutton, arrange the potatoes around 
it and serve with a brown sauce made in the pan in which the 
meat was cooked. 



BREAST OF MUTTON 

1 breast of mutton i pint of green peas 

2 onions 4 i tablespoonful of flour 

I level tcMOonful of salt i tablespoonful. of butter 
I saltspoqaful of pepper i tablespoonful of chopped pars- 
ley 

Separate the breast between the ribs ; put them into a stewing 
pan and shake until they are a nice brown. Add the butter and 
flour mixed, and one quart of stock ; add all the seasonings. 
Cover and simmer gently until the mutton is tender — about one

hour. Then add the peas and cook twenty minutes. Lift the 
meat, put it in the centre of a platter, strain the sauce over it ; 
put the peas around near the meat, and outside of this a roll of 
carefully boiled rice. This forms an admirable dish for six or 
eight persons at a cost of ten or fifteen cents. 

BAKED LOIN OF MUTTON 

Bake according to the rules for baking. 

The loin takes its weight in length rather than in thickness, 
so that one hour and a half will be quite sufficient time for bak- 
ing, no matter what its weight. Serve with it brown sauce in 
a boat, boiled rice, stuffed tomatoes or plain stewed tomatoes, 
or creamed turnips. 

BROILED CHOPS 

Proceed the same as for a broiled steak. 

The loin and rack chops will be treated in precisely the same 
manner. French chops are loin chops, trimmed. Save the 
trimmings for stock. 

An English or Southdown chop will be two inches thick 
and will require fifteen minutes. The ordinary American chops 
are not over half an inch thick and will require ten minutes. 
Serve with tomato sauce in the bottom of the dish, and plain 
creamed potatoes, or plain with peas or asparagus tips. 

In the ordinary gas range they will be broiled precisely the 
same as steak. With an oil stove they must be dry panned. 
Great care, however, must be taken, as mutton is much fatter 
than beef and is more liable to fry. Have the chops thin and 
cook them quickly ; season and serve immediately. 

MASKED CHOPS 

Select French chops and have them neatly trimmed. Have 
ready some boiled mashed potatoes, nicely seasoned. Beat the 
potatoes until very light; broil the chops quickly for five 
inutes. While they are warm heap the mashed potatoes into 
mound on one side of the lean portion of each. Dip them into 
beaten egg, cover with bread crumbs, and plunge into hot fat

for about two minutes. Decorate the bones with quills of 
paper, heap them in the centre of a chop dish, fill the spaces 
with nicely cooked peas and send at once to the table. This 
makes an exceedingly nice luncheon dish — meat and two 
vegetables served in one dish at the same time. 



MASKED CHOPS, No. 2 

Select and broil the chops as in preceding recipe. Have ready 
a force meat made by adding one can of mushrooms, chopped 
fine, to one gill of thick white sauce. Use for the sauce one 
tablespoonful of butter and one of flour, a half cup (i gill) of 
milk ; add a level teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pep- 
per. Heap the mixture on top of the warm chops. Dip, fry, 
and serve with peas the same as in preceding recipe. 



BROILED CHOPS' "HEARTS" WITH MUSHROOMS 

12 French chops 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 

I pound of mushrooms i tablespoonful of flour 

12 slices of bread i gill of milk 

Wash the mushrooms and cut them into four or five pieces. 
Put them into a stewing pan with the butter, a level teaspoonful 
of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cover closely and cook 
for twenty minutes. Moisten the flour gradually with the 
milk; when smooth add to the mushrooms; bring to boiling, 
point, cover and push to the back of the stove. Cut from the 
chops just the lean portion. This will give you a piece about 
the size of a silver dollar. Cut from each slice of bread 
with a round cutter a piece that will allow a margin of half 
an inch outside the mutton. Toast the bread carefully, and 
arrange it on a heated platter. Broil the "hearts" as you 
would chops. When done, dust each with salt and pepper 
and arrange them on the toast, pour over the mushrooms, gar- 
nish with peas, and send at once to the table. This is one of 
the most elegant of mutton dishes.

SCOTCH STEW 

2 necks of mutton i quart of strained tomatoes 

I onion 2 tablespoonfuls of suet 

I bay leaf 2 tablespoonfuls of flour 

I teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet 

Cut the necks into convenient pieces. Put the suet into a stew- 
ing pan and shake over the fire until it is nearly melted ; remove 
the "cracklings," put in the pieces of mutton, shake until they 
are seared on all sides. Draw them to one side. Add the flour 
to the fat and mix ; add the tomatoes. Stir until boiling ; add 
all the seasoning; cover the pan and simmer gently at about 
i8o° Fahr. for one and a half hours. Serve in a border 
of boiled rice; serve also boiled or baked onions with cream 
sauce.

Divide the breast between the ribs; put these into a stewing 
pan, add the celery cut into pieces, and cover with the boiling 
water or stock; add the onion and bay leaf; cover, bring to 
boiling point and boil rapidly for five minutes ; then cook 
slowly, below boiling point, for one hour. Rub the butter and 
flour together ; add one pint of the water in which the breast 
was cooked; stir until boiling. Dish the breast neatly in the 
centre of the platter ; put over it the celery ; heap around it a 
border of nicely boiled rice, or a border of mashed potatoes; 
add to the sauce a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, 
the yolks of the two eggs, slightly beaten. Strain this over the 
meat, dust with the chopped parsley and send at once to the 
table. The sauce cannot be boiled after the eggs are added. 
Baked tomatoes may be served with this ; the dish is complete, 
however, as it is.

MUTTON a la DAUBE 

2 necks of mutton i teaspoonful of salt 

I pint of bread crumbs i saltspoonful of pepper 

I tablespoonful of mixed herbs 

Wipe the necks, and make a pocket under the fat portion. 
Make a stuffing of the bread crumbs, seasonings, and a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Put this into the pockets, sew them 
up and place at once in a pan ; add a pint of stock or water, one 
onion, sliced, two bay leaves. Cover the pan and cook in a 
moderately quick oven two hours. Serve with a brown sauce 
made from the water in the pan. 

This recipe will answer for any cheap pieces of beef, or for 
neck of veal. 

Serve with it macaroni or rice and parsnips, or salsify, or 
corn. 

HAGGIS 

I sheep's heart 2 eggs 

I tongue 2 sardines or anchovies 
I small liver i level teaspoonful of salt 

I pound of bacon ^ teaspoonful of pepper 

I pint of bread crumbs Grated yellow rind of lemon 

Wash the heart, tongue and liver, put them through the meat 
chopper with the bacon. Then add the crumbs and sardines, 
lemon rind, salt and pepper. Beat the eggs until well mixed, 
add with the juice of the lemon, and add them to the whole. 
Mix thoroughly and put the mixture into the pouch of the 
sheep, which has been thoroughly cleaned ; or put it into a kettle 
or mold and boil or steam continuously for two hours. Turn 
out on a large dish, and serve plain with brown sauce in a boat. 
Pass brown or corn bread and apple sauce.

cut the potatoes into dice. Put a layer over the top of the mut- 
ton, then a layer of chopped onions, then fish, then a dusting 
of salt and pepper. Then another layer of mutton and so con- 
tinue until all the ingredients are used, having the last layer 
potatoes. Rub together two tablespoonfuls of butter and two 
of flour, add a pint of stock, stir until boiling and pour over 
the ingredients in the pan. Bake in a slow oven three hours. 

Loin chops are sometimes used for this dish and layers of 
oysters frequently substituted for fish. Serve plain cabbage or 
kale, or creamed cabbage or turnips, or spinach. 



SHEEP'S HEAD 

A sheep's head may be used and dressed precisely the same as 
a calf's head, but two heads must be served in the place of one 
calf's head. The hearts, liver and kidneys may also be served 
as calves' hearts, liver or kidneys. They are much less in price 
and very good. 



SHEEP'S TROTTERS 

4 large-sized trotters i teaspoonful of salt 

Yz cupful of bread crumbs i saltspoonful of pepper 
I tablespoonful of chopped parsley 

Wash the trotters, put them into a saucepan, cover with boiling 
water, bring to the boiling point and skin. Cook gently for two 
hours. Take out the trotters and remove the bones carefully. 
Put the meat into a baking pan, cover over a layer of bread 
crumbs, a dusting of salt, pepper and parsley, then another of 
meat and so continue, having the last layer crumbs. Baste 
with sufficient of the liquor to be seen at the top. Bake in a 
moderate oven for one hour and send to the table in the baking 
dish. This is exceedingly good with a layer of tomatoes 
between the trotters and crumbs, or tomato sauce basted over 
the top instead of the liquor. Serve as a supper dish with com 
or oatmeal bread.

SHEEP HEAD CHEESE 

2 sheep's heads i saltspoonful of pepper 

I level teaspoonful of salt i tablespoonful of chopped pars- 

Yz teaspoonful of summer savory ley 

Wash the heads thoroughly, being careful to clean the nasal 
and throat passage. Split them into halves, and remove the 
tongues. Put the heads and tongues in a soup kettle, and cover 
them with cold water. Cover, boil and skin ; cook slowly for 
two hours or until the bones fall from the meat. Take out the 
bones with a skimmer. Chop the meat rather fine and add the 
seasoning to it. Put into a colander a strong, good-sized piece 
of musHn. Turn into it the mixture. Let it drip for a while 
(there should be very little liquor) ; then fold over and tie the 
cloth tightly. Place it in the cold. To serve remove the cloth, 
cut the cheese into thin slices and' pass with it tomato or lettuce 
salad. This is cheap, rather nutritious and economical. It may 
be made on Saturday for Sunday's supper, or used as a lunch 
dish. 

LAMB'S KIDNEYS 

Cut the kidneys into halves without really separating them and 
remove the white tubes. Place one on a skewer, then a slice of 
bacon, then another kidney. Baste with butter and broil for 
five mintites on a clear fire. Put over a little more butter and 
send to the table on a very hot dish. Pass toast or brown bread. 
These may be served for breakfast, lunch or supper. 

LAMBS' SWEETBREADS 

Lambs' sweetbreads may be cooked the same as calves' sweet- 
breads. Follow any of the rules given. 



VEAL 

Veal, th€ young of beef, is divided much the same as mutton. 
First, the animal is divided into halves, then fore and hind 
quarters. The fore quarter is subdivided into rack, breast,

shoulder, neck, head and end of brisket, breast and sticking 
pieces ; the hind quarter, into leg, from which we get the cutlets 
and fillets, the loin, which is again divided into best and bony 
end, the flank, which is frequently wrapped around the leg and 
taken off with it, the knuckle, which is the lower part of the leg, 
and the feet. Chops are cut from the loin r.nd ribs. A thin 
slice from the leg is called cutlet. A thick slice is a fillet; it 
does not, however, in any way correspond with the fillet of beef, 
which is the tenderloin. It is also sold under the name of 
''cushion of veal." 

Select veal with the flesh firm, pinkish tinged, with hard 
good-sized bones. Young veal is not only unwholesome, but 
frequently dangerous ; is always known by the small tender or 
flexible bones, the flesh has a bluish tinge and is soft and flabby. 
The loin, shoulder, fillet and breast are best for roasting, or 
baking. The knuckle, the lower part of the leg, the neck, and 
bony pieces are used for stocks, stews and pies. The feet for 
jelly; the head for soup and entrees. Any method requiring 
long, slow, moist cooking is to be preferred. Plain baked or 
roasted veal is more difficult of digestion than veal boiled. 
Veal is a nitrogenous food, very difficult of digestion, hence 
must not be eaten by children or persons with impaired diges- 
tion. 



BAKED LOIN OF VEAL 

Wipe the loin, place it in a baking pan, dredge it lightly with 
pepper. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in a half pint of water, 
pour it in the pan, cover over another pan of the same size, a 
piece of oiled paper. Place in a quick oven until the outside is 
thoroughly seared. This will require about fifteen minutes. 
Cool the oven to 240° Fahr. and cook slowly twenty minutes to 
each pound of meat, basting frequently. Veal is dense, difficult 
of digestion and requires a slow moist heat to make it at all 
eatable. Left-over veal may be served cold with tomato cold 
or chilli sauce, or made into croquettes, boudins or curry. Serve 
with baked veal, browned mashed or creamed hashed potatoes, 
and peas, string or lima beans, or tomatoes baked or panned.

you have a thick, white sauce ; add this to the meat, mix and 
turn out to cool. When cold, form into croquettes, dip in egg, 
roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat, 360° Fahr. Serve plain 
or with tomato sauce. When served for lunch, pass with them 
mayonnaise of celery, or nicely seasoned peas, 

CUTLET a la FLAMANDE

a little of the chopped onion. Put on top of this the cutlet; 
brush it with melted butter, sprinkle over the remaining part 
of the onion, the pepper, and place on top the tomatoes chopped 
fine. Run this into a quick oven and bake for a half hour. Lift 
carefully onto a hot platter. Strain over the sauce from the 
bottom of the pan, dust with salt, and send at once to the table.

throw them into cold water; drain, throw into boiling water 
and cook for ten minutes ; drain again. Hard boil the eggs ; cut 
the whites of the eggs into fancy shapes ; cut the meat into 
blocks. Cover the gelatin with four tablespoonfuls of cold 
water, soak for a half hour, add a tablespoonful of chopped 
carrot, a tablespoonful of chopped onion, the beef extract, and a 
pint of boiling water or the stock. Bring this to a boil, and 
strain. Pour a little of this jelly into small individual molds 
that have been moistened in cold water. When it has hardened, 
arrange artistically the beet, egg and cucumber. Pour over it a 
little more jelly, and allow it to harden. Put the meat on top of 
this. Garnish the sides with the remaining egg and beet, and 
then pour over sufficient jelly to just cover. Stand aside over 
night, or for several hours. When ready to serve, dip each mold 
quickly in warm water, loosen the edge with a knife, turn out 
on a flat dish and fill the centre of the dish with fringed or cut 
celery, mixed with mayonnaise dressing. This is one of the 
nicest of cold entrees. Other meats may be substituted for veal. 
Serve on small plates and pass with them sandwiches of nuts, 
or plain bread and butter, or they may be served with lettuce, 
or mayonnaise of tomatoes, or plain cress salad, as a salad 
course. 

VEAL (ITALIAN STYLE)

Throw the macaroni into boiling water, and boil rapidly for 
twenty minutes; drain and throw into cold water for a half 
hour ; drain again. Put it into a saucepan with just enough 
stock to cover; simmer gently while you cook the veal. Cut 
it in neat squares. Put a little suet or oil into a saute pan, 
and when hot drop in the veal ; stir quickly ; then push it on the 
back part of the stove where it will cook slowly for a half hour. 
It is wise to cover the saucepan, as in this way the moisture is 
retained and the veal softened. Mix the cheese and the bread 
crumbs together, Add a little red pepper and a quarter of a

teaspoonful of salt. Add one-half the remaining salt to the 
macaroni and dust the other over the veal cutlets. When ready 
to serve, put the veal in the centre of the platter ; pour over the 
macaroni. Put the bread crumbs for just a moment into the 
saute pan from which the veal was taken. Stir them over the 
fire until quite hot, and slightly browned. Put them over the 
top of the dish, and send at once to the table. 

FRENCH HASH 

I calf's heart i tablespoonful of butter

Wash the heart through several cold waters ; cover it with boil- 
ing water. Cook slowly for three hours, until tender. If you 
are making stock, the heart may be cooked in the stock pot. 
When ready to use, chop the heart very fine. Rub the butter 
and flour together, add a half pint of the liquor in which the 
heart was cooked; stir until boiling; add a teaspoonful of 
kitchen bouquet, a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of 
pepper ; add the chopped heart. Cook carefully on the back of 
the stove for twenty minutes. Cut slices of bread into rounds, 
and toast them ; heap the hash on these, put on top of each a 
neatly poached egg, and send at once to the table. If this is 
nicely garnished it makes a sightly and attractive luncheon or 
breakfast dish.

two eggs. Dish the hearts and pour over the sauce. Garnish 
the dish with carefully boiled rice, and send at once to the table.

2 calves' hearts i pint of bread crumbs 

Yi. pint of tomatoes i onion

Wash the hearts thoroughly in cold water and remove all the 
tough muscular part from near the top. Remove the clot of 
blood from the tip. Put the crumbs into a bowl, add the 
tomato, salt, pepper and onion ; mix and stuff it into the hearts. 
Take two stitches across the top of the heart, drawing it 
together. Stand them in a small saucepan, tips down. The 
saucepan must be sufficiently small to keep them from toppling 
over. Pour into the saucepan sufficient water or stock to partly 
cover; bring quickly to boiling point. Add a teaspoonful of 
salt, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a bay leaf, and simmer 
gently for two hours. Lift the hearts carefully ; put them into 
a baking pan; brush with melted butter and bake in a quick 
oven (about 400° Fahr.) for a half hour, or until they are 
nicely browned. While they are cooking, rub together two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour; add the water in 
which they were cooked; stir until boiling, add a teaspoonful 
of kitchen bouquet. Dish the hearts ; remove the strings from 
the top ; put them on a platter, butts together ; garnish the dish 
with nicely cooked peas or string beans, or macedoine. If con- 
venient, place at each end of the platter three baked tomatoes ; 
strain over the brown sauce, dust thickly with chopped parsley, 
and send at once to the table. This is one of the nicest of all 
the cheap meat dishes. Use for supper or lunch.

tre. When it comes home, take out the brains and throw them 
into cold water. Wash the head well in several cold waters, 
and then with a sharp knife split the skin down the underneath 
part of the head, and keeping your knife near to the bone, 
remove the skin in one piece ; singe it carefully. Throw it into 
cold water and let it soak for an hour ; then with a knife scrape 
perfectly clean, singe and throw it again into cold water. Wash 
the head through several cold waters, being very careful to 
clean the nasal and throat passage. When perfectly clean, pour 
over it a teakettleful of boiling water. Take it from this hot 
water, put it into a soup kettle, place the skin on top. Cover 
with four quarts of cold water ; bring quickly to boiling point 
and skim. Cover the kettle and push it to the back part of the 
stove to simmer gently for two hours ; then add all the season- 
ings and simmer one hour longer. While this is cooking, 
remove the membrane from the brains, throw them into cold 
water, wash and put into a saucepan of boiling water. Simmer 
gently, not boil, for twenty minutes. Lift with a skimmer, and 
with a silver knife cut them into four pieces. When the head is 
done, remove the skin from the water and cut it into pieces 
about four inches long and two inches wide. Skin the tongue ; 
cut into slices; put it in the centre of the platter; arrange 
the bits of skin neatly over and around. Put at the ends of 
the platter the brains and pour over sauce vinegarette. The 
remainder of the head and the water in which it was cooked 
will be used for calf's head soup. By saving a portion of the 
skin you may, from one head, make mock-turtle soup, and calf's 
head soup, and trussed calf's head, three elegant dishes for 
one dollar. Serve with calf's head, sliced tomato or celery or 
lettuce, or serve alone as an entree. 



METHOD No. 2 

After the calf's head has been cooked as in preceding recipe, 
the skin cut into pieces two inches square, the tongue sliced and 
the brains parboiled, arrange them neatly in the centre of a 
large platter. Have ready tomatoes that have been baked 
whole. To prepare, scald the tomatoes, remove the skin ; cut

a little hole in the stem end, put in a teaspoonful of butter, and 
a dusting of salt and pepper; bake in the oven until they are 
just tender. Arrange them around the dish with alternate 
triangular pieces of toast or a square crouton. Rub together 
two tablespoonfuls of flour and two of butter; when smooth 
add a pint of the liquor in which the head was cooked. Stir 
until boiling ; add a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, a sweet red 
])epper and a half can of mushrooms, chopped fine. Cook 
slowly for about five minutes, and pour it over the calf's head. 
This is an elegant entree or nice luncheon dish. Pass with it 
peas or asparagus tips. 

SWEETBREADS 

These are a part of the digestive viscera of the calf, hence, are 
easily digested. When simply cooked they only require one 
hour for perfect digestion. They belong to the proteid or 
nitrogenous group of foods, although they are not as stimulat- 
ing as meats. 

They are sold in pairs, called by the butchers, "heart" and 
"throat" sweetbreads. The "throat" sweetbread (the thymus 
gland) is long and full of membrane. The "heart" sweetbread 
(the pancreas) is short, firm and compact, quite free from 
membrane, which makes it preferable for baking or broiling or 
any method of cooking where the sweetbreads are to be served 
whole. The thymus gland is just as good for creamed sweet- 
breads or any method where the sweetbread is to be picked 
into small pieces. No matter in what way sweetbreads are to 
be cooked they must be first parboiled or boiled. They hold 
digestive secretions that naturally cause them to "spoil" 
quickly; they digest themselves. This makes it necessary 
to wash and parboil them as soon as they come from the market. 
They may then be put aside, and will keep nicely in a cold place 
for one or two days. 

TO CREAM SWEETBREADS 

Wash the sweetbreads, throw them into boiling- water and sim- 
mer gently for three-quarters of an hour. Drain, cool quickly.

and break them apart into pieces, rejecting the membrane. 
Chop fine a half can of mushrooms, mix them with the sweet- 
breads. Put one tablespoonful of flour, one of butter into a 
saucepan ; add a half pint of milk ; stir until boiling. Add the 
sweetbreads and mushrooms, a teaspoonful of salt and a salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Stand over hot water for ten minutes. 
This may be served on toast, in individual dishes, paper cases, or 
in a dish garnished with nicely cooked green peas. This same 
mixture is served in pate shells, bread boxes or bouchee cases, 

BAKED SWEETBREADS 

Select fine heart sweetbreads. Wash them in cold water, throw 
them into boiling water, simmer twenty minutes. Drain; put 
them into a baking pan, and cover the top with a little melted 
glaze. Put in the bottom of the pan two or three slices of bacon 
and a quarter cup of water. Add a teaspoonful of kitchen bou- 
quet, a half teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Bake in a quick oven a half hour, basting twice. Have ready 
a can of peas, drained, washed, heated and seasoned with salt, 
pepper and butter, or the same quantity of fresh peas. Put 
them into the bottom of a heated platter, stand the sweetbreads 
into the peas, baste over the sauce from the bottom of the pan 
and send at once to the table. 

BROILED SWEETBREADS 

Wash and boil the sweetbreads a half hour. When cold cut 
them into slices lengthwise; dust each slice with salt and pep- 
per, put them into a broiler and broil over a quick fire five 
minutes, turning once. Have ready a nicely heated platter, 
dish the sweetbreads, put over them a little butter and send at

cloves, and a blade of mace. Cover the saucepan and cook 
gently one hour. Take out the sweetbreads and stand them 
aside to cool. Strain the water in which they were cooked and 
stand it aside to cool. When ready to serve take the fat from 
the top of the water, remove the membrane from the sweet- 
breads and cut them crosswise in three or four pieces. Put two 
tablespoon fuls of butter and two of flour in a saucepan ; mix, 
add a pint of the liquor in which the sweetbreads were cooked 
and stir until boiling. Add the sweetbreads, a teaspoonful of 
kitchen bouquet, a level teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful 
of pepper, and, if you use it, four tablespoonfuls of sherry. 
Cover and cook over hot water for fifteen minutes. Serve with 
peas or asparagus tips. 

PORK 

While this animal must be classed with meats, the fat and lean 
flesh are very different from the fat and lean flesh of other 
animals. The texture of the lean pork corresponds more nearly 
to veal, while that of the fat is loose and more easily digested 
than the fat of other animals. Do not misunderstand. Cooked 
fats are universally to be condemned and the fat of pork, while 
it is easily digested in the raw state and more easily digested in 
the cooked state than other fats, is not to be recommended as 
a desirable food. 

When it becomes necessary to add fat in greater quantities 
to our daily food, it is by far better to select a variety of fats 
that may be used uncooked, as butter, cream, olive oil and the 
fatty nuts. While butter and cream are liable to animal con- 
tamination, they are much more easily digested than cooked 
fats. 

To repeat, the cooking of fats, which is necessary with the 
fat of animals to remove the danger of diseased germs, decom- 
poses the fats, producing fatty irritant acids that irritate the 
mucous lining of the digestive tract. 

The lean flesh of pork requires, even when carefully cooked, 
five hours for perfect digestion. If a man of sedentary habits 
uses nitrogenous foods of this kind, his stomach is rarely ever 
at rest, hence, it would give out at an early period of life ; in fact, 



182 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



it would have finished its power of digestion or it would have 
lived its Hfe at an early age. It is not the number of years that 
complete one's life; one person may accomplish more in forty 
than another in eighty years, so the period of life must be rated 
according to the amount of energy expended and not the num- 
ber of years actually lived. 

Palatability of pork induces many unthinking people to eat 
it frequently and in large quantities. Pork eating people are, 
as a rule, inclined to indigestion. Breakfast bacon is more 
digestible than any other form of fatty meat ; this is due to its 
preparation, but even breakfast bacon must be eaten with care, 
once in a while and in small quantities. 

Pork containing more fat than the flesh of other animals 
is frequently placed with the carbonaceous, heat and energy 
foods, rather than with the muscle and tissue building foods. 
For this reason with beans (muscle making) we use pork, 
(heat producing) ; we do not serve beef with beans, both are 
muscle builders ; but beef and potatoes, pork and beans. 

According to my way of thinking, the hog, no matter how 
well fed, has little place on the well regulated table of thinking 
people. Granting that the fat is more easily digested than the 
fat of other animals, the lean flesh is dense, difficult of digestion 
and must be overcooked to be at all safe. Life is too short to 
spend it in digesting pork. Better by far take nitrogen in a 
more easily digested form and fats less liable to contamination. 

BREAKFAST BACON 

Cut the bacon into slices as thin as a wafer; put them into a 
large pan and pour over sufficient boiling water to cover the 
bottom of the pan. Boil rapidly until the bacon is transparent 
and the water evaporated; turn the bacon for a few moments 
until crisp and brown. Send at once to the table on a heated 
plate. Serve with it eggs or steak. 

BROILED BACON 

Cut the bacon into very thin strips ; place them between a wire 
broiler, broil quickly on one side, turn and broil quickly on the 
other. Curl while hot and send at once to the table.

ROLLED BACON 

This is made by following the first recipe. As soon as the 
water evaporates and the bacon is transparent, roll it quickly 
and fasten with a little wooden skewer or tooth pick, and brown 
over the fire in an ordinary wire broiler. Draw out the skewer 
and send at once to the table. Broiled or fried bacon may be 
rolled while it is hot, just before it becomes crisp. 

BAKED HAM 

Procure a small, rather lean ham ; wash it thoroughly in cold 
water, sprinkle it with baking soda, and with a small brush 
scrub the soda all over the ham. Rinse in cold water, trim it 
neatly and place it in a baking pan skin side down. Mix in a 
small bowl a saltspoonful of pepper, a saltspoonful of cloves, 
two saltspoonfuls of cinnamon, and a half teaspoonful of celery 
seed ; rub these thoroughly into the meat while it is in the pan. 
Then sprinkle over it a thick layer of finely chopped onion. 
Make a paste by adding slowly a half cup of water to one cup- 
ful of flour. Roll this paste out in a thin sheet sufficiently large 
to cover the entire flesh side of the ham, tuck it down close to 
the skin. Fill the pan two-thirds full of hot cider ; if you are 
extravagant you may use a bottle of white wine. Stand it in 
the oven and bake four hours, basting over the top of the paste. 
When done remove the paste and skin ; trim the meat 
from the end bone, decorate the bone with a quill of paper, 
and place the ham on a hot platter, fat side down. Take four 
tablespoonfuls of fat from the surface of the liquor in the pan, 
mix with it two tablespoonfuls of flour, add a half pint of good 
stock, a half pint of cider or champagne ; stir until boiling; add 
a grating of nutmeg and strain into a sauce boat. 

Serve with sweet potato croquettes, stuffed and baked 
tomatoes, spinach, kale or cold slaw, and apple sauce. 



TO SERVE BAKED HAM COLD 

Cut the cold baked ham into very thin slices; arrange them 
leatly overlapping, down one side of the meat platter. Fill the

other side with cold tomato sauce ; between the two put a row 
of parsley; garnish the entire dish with quarters of peeled 
tomatoes. Pass with it apple salad. 

HAM WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

1 slice of ham, a half inch thick 2 whole or one-half cup of 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter stewed tomatoes 

I tablespoonful of chopped eel- 4 tablespoonfuls of stock, or, if 
ery or saltspoonful of celery you use wine, 4 tablespoon- 

seed fuls of sherry 

Put the tomatoes through a sieve; add the celery seed, butter, 
one teaspoonful of onion juice, saltspoonful of pepper; then add 
the stock or wine ; and stand the saucepan over hot water. Put 
over the fire an iron pan ; when very hot put in the ham. As 
soon as browned on one side, turn and brown the other; turn 
almost constantly for five minutes. Put on a heated dish and 
pour over the sauce. Send at once to the table. 

QUICK SAUSAGE 

I pound of lean pork i level teaspoonful of salt 

I teaspoonful of sage i saltspoonful of pepper 

Chop the meat very fine ; add to it the seasoning and make into 
small cakes the size and thickness of a Hamburg steak; put 
them into a heated iron pan and cook quickly, browning on both 
sides ; then push them over a very moderate fire and cook 
slowly, turning once or twice until they are thoroughly done, 
about fifteen minutes. To make a brown sauce add to the fat 
in the pan two tablespoonfuls of flour ; add a half pint of water 
or stock; stir until boiled and add a teaspoonful of kitchen 
bouquet. Serve with this, mashed or browned potatoes and 
apple sauce. 

PIG'S CHEEK 

Purchase a pig's head, singe carefully, then scald it thoroughly, 
and scrape off any hair that may be left. Split the head into 
halves ; put the forehead or front of the head on a board and 



MEATS

split through from the back ; remove the brains, clean and put 
them in cold water ; take out the tongue. Wash the head thor- 
oughly in cold water ; scald and scrape the skin again until per- 
fectly white. Cover with cold water and soak over night ; in the 
morning put two halves into a kettle, cover with cold water, 
add the tongue and cook slowly for two hours. Lift, drain 
carefully, and dish on a large platter, nose ends together. Have 
ready cooked a half peck of spinach, chopped fine and seasoned ; 
heap this over the nose and in the centre of the dish, put the 
tongue, sliced, on one side, and the cooked brains on the other 
and a hard boiled egg cut into eighths, in the centre of the 
spinach. Pass with this apple sauce, or pan-baked apples, and 
mashed and browned white or sweet potatoes. 



PIGS* FEET 

Purchase a set (4) of pigs' feet. Wash them thoroughly in 
cold water ; scald and scrape them, cover with cold water and 
soak over night. Now split the feet into halves lengthwise ; put 
them into a baking pan skin side down ; dust with salt and pep- 
per, cover with chopped onion, then pour over sufficient boiling 
water to cover. Put over another pan and cook in the oven for 
one hour, basting frequently; when done, dish the feet neatly. 
Rub together two tablespoonfuls of butter, two of flour, add a 
half pint of water from the pan in which they were cooked and 
a half pint of strained tomato, add a half teaspoonful of salt 
and a saltspoonful of pepper and strain over the feet. 

Serve as a supper dish, and pass with them brown bread and 
cold slaw. 



ANOTHER METHOD 

After they are baked, dip in egg, roll in crumbs and fry in 
smoking hot fat, or they may be rolled in bread crumbs and 
broiled. Serve with them apple sauce or pan-baked apples and 
brown bread. 

Pass sauce piquante. 



POULTRY AND GAME 

POULTRY 

Under this heading we shall consider the ordinary barnyard 
fowls — turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese and guinea fowls, also 
tame pigeons. These may be said to be in season during the 
greater part of the year, and next to the mammals are the most 
important of the meat diet. They belong to the nitrogenous or 
muscle-making foods, lacking, however, the stimulating quality 
of the red meats. The ratio of water is about the same as in 
beef and mutton. The fat is not stored throughout the lean 
flesh, as in the larger domestic animals, but in parts of the body. 
In overfed chickens it accumulates over and through the intes- 
tines, while in turkeys we find an additional layer underneath 
the skin of the breast. 

Guinea fowls, chickens, and pigeons are best adapted to 
the delicate stomach. 

Turkeys are, as a rule, well fed, carefully cleaned and come 
to the markets dry picked, with their heads and feet on, an 
exceedingly good way of marketing all kinds of poultry. 
When poultry is unduly fattened and there is a layer of fat 
underneath the skin, the meat, its depth not being great, 
becomes during cooking saturated with overheated fat, which 
is apt to disagree with delicate stomachs. For this reason 
ducks and geese are not so desirable as fowl. The greater the 
amount of fat, the less lean me and the more expensive our 
nitrogen, hence, overfattened fowls are less nutritious, less easy 
of digestion and more expensive. 

Guinea fowl is a sort of cross between a wild bird and a 
domestic fowl, is lean, nutritious and easy of digestion; the 
meat is dark and rich in flavor. 

Osmozone, that constituent which gives odor, flavor and 
color to meats, is found in smaller quantities in fowls than in 
red meats, For this reason Beaumont says that ''white meat is 

186 



POULTRY AND GAME 



1S7 



more difficult of digestion and less attractive than red meat ; it 
is, however, less stimulating." 

Spring chickens contain less nourishment than full grown 
fowls. They are used for broiling and panning, and are served 
as a delicate, appetizing morsel rather than a true food. 

Barnyard fowls should be cooped for at least six days 
before killing. This does not mean to huddle ten or fifteen 
chickens in a small coop and feed anything near at hand. They 
must have a clean, good space, and be well fed on corn for at 
least five days, then for twenty-four hours before killing, on 
skimmed milk or soft boiled rice. The night before, give them 
plenty of water, no food. In this way the ''crop" will be entirely 
empty, the intestines clean, the dark almost as light as the white 
flesh, and both will have a clean, sweet and delicious flavor. 

Too often our common fowl has the meat so impregnated 
with unsuitable and offensive food, that the educated palate 
must reject it. The flesh of all animals is more or less flavored 
by food ; for instance, a "celery fed" duck commands a higher 
price than one fed on corn ; the canvas-back and the red-head 
ducks swim side by side down the water, the first eating the 
roots of the so-called ''wild celery," which are rich in flavor, 
the latter taking the tops left floating on the water ; as a result 
the canvas-back ducks are so impregnated with this desirable 
flavor that they retail at from two to three dollars a pair, while 
their close companions, the red-heads, are sold at a dollar. 
Rhode Island turkeys bring twice as much as the ordinary tur- 
keys, simply because they are fed on a special food which 
imparts to the flesh a desired flavor. 

All fowls raised for food purposes should have clean food 
and plenty of cold water. 



HOW TO KILL A FOWL. 

To kill, stick them with a sharp knife through the jugular vein ; 
this is best done by opening the mouth and cutting it on 
the inside of the neck. Hang them at once, by the feet, that 
they may bleed freely. Pick while they are warm, taking care 
not to tear the skin. Do not make any gashes in the flesh ; do 
not cut off the head or feet. 



1S8 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

It is always objectionable to scald poultry for picking pur- 
poses; it is a lazy way of getting off the feathers. Scalded 
chickens spoil quickly ; scalding warms and frequently cooks 
the outside flesh. If then the intestines are not taken out for 
several days, and the meat improperly cooled, the flesh is unfk 
for eating, and extremely liable to cause ptomaine poisoning. 

To prepare poultry for market, after picking, dip the feet 
into boiling water up as far as what may be called the "knee 
joint." Cut or loosen the skin around the joint and pull it off 
as you would turn off a glove, wrong side out. This will leave 
the feet perfectly clean, so that they may be used for stock and 
other purposes. Tie the feet together and wrap the neck as 
shown in the cut. Personally I should like such a chicken 
wrapped at once in oil paper to prevent contaminations from 
dust and handling. 

how to select a fowl. 

In selecting a chicken, choose one with firm flesh, feet and legs 
soft and free from scales, wings and the end of the breast 
bone limber, and with a sufficient amount of fat to make the 
chicken plump, but not enough to increase its weight ; avoid old 
hens, especially those with tremendous bulk at the end of the 
breast bone — they are expensive, even at half price, as the intes- 
tines, fat and eggs they contain will weigh two pounds, and 
the flesh is neither well flavored nor tender. The end of the 
breast-bone remains cartilage until the chicken is about one 
year old; if this is pliable it denotes a young chicken. As a 
chicken grows older, the point become sharp and hard, and it 
is really a "fowl ;" when exceedingly hard, it denotes an old 
fowl. 

A "chicken" is a fowl under nine months old. A "pullet" is 
a young hen less than a year old. "Broilers" are spring chick- 
ens, chickens about four or* five months old. "Fowl" is a term 
used to designate a chicken or rooster from a year and a half 
to two years old. A capon, a castrated cock or "spayed" hen, 
stands at the very head of domestic fowls. Their growth is 
rapid, their meat tender and delicious, and as they always com- 
mand a high price, they are much better cared for than ordinary

POULTRY AND GAME

barnyard fowls. They have the tenderness of very young 
chickens, with the rich flavor of maturity. 



HOW TO DRAW AND TRUSS A FOWL. 

These directions will answer equally well for chicken or turkey, 
After the "fowl" has been picked or as it comes to you from the 
market, hold it over a burning gas jet or over a little burning 
alcohol or alcohol lamp, to carefully singe off the long, hair-like 
feathers. Unfold the wings so that they will be properly singed. 
If obliged to use paper, select a piece of manilla, twist it rope-like, 
place it in a coal scuttle or baking pan, light it, and hold the 
fowl over the flame, turning until it is well singed. Do not 
allow the soot or carbon to be deposited on the turkey, as it 
spoils both the appearance and flavor of the flesh. As soon as 
the fowl is singed, put it into a pan of cold water, wash the 
skin thoroughly, then rinse with clean water and wipe dry. 
With a cleaver cut off the head, leaving a long neck. To 
remove the feet, cut the skin at the side of the leg, running the 
knife lightly over the top ; bend the leg back until the "sinews" 
on top are exposed ; then with a wooden skewer or strong fork 
loosen them one by one and pull them out. To do this, grasp 
the upper part of the leg, holding it firm, until you loosen the 
ligaments. In this way they will come out perfectly clean with- 
out tearing the flesh. Now, cut through the tough muscle at 
the joint, exposing the ligaments on the under side, and grasp- 
ing the flesh of the leg again, draw these out, one at a time. 
Then cut through the tough muscle at the back. If properly 
done you will have taken out five sinews from the upper side, 
and two from the under. After removing the second leg turn 
the fowl on the breast, make a long gash down the back of the 
neck, cutting the skin to the bone. Fold the skin back over the 
breast and carefully remove the crop, being very careful not to 
break the skin or the crop. When the crop is loosened so that 
you can take it in your hand, cut that part which is fastened to 
the intestines at the neck and remove it. Now turn the fowl 
over on its back ; make an incision at the end of the breast-bone 
and with your two front fingers loosen all the intestines at the 
back. Then at the crop opening, loosen the heart and lungs, 



190 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

or "lights." Put your two fingers and thumb in the opening 
under the breast bone, grasp the gizzard and intestines, and 
carefully remove them all together and without breaking. Drop 
them for a moment and with a sharp knife cut around the large 
int-estine and your chicken is clean. Examine to see if the 
heart and lungs are removed; then cut the oil sack from the 
rump, wipe carefully on the inside with a wet cloth to remove 
blood clots. Do not, under any circumstances, put chickens or 
turkeys into a pan of cold water to soak. If there is an odor 
about the flesh, it is unfit for food, and washing will not remove 
it. The juices of the flesh are drawn out by the soaking; the 
meat is tasteless and you have lost a portion of the nourishment. 
There is no necessity for breaking the gall or intestines, but if 
such a thing should occur, quickly wipe off the flesh. The fowl 
is now ready for '"trussing," or putting into shape. 

TRUSSING. 

Cut the neck close to the breast-bone ; fold the skin back ; tuck 
the wings down over it and with a single stitch fasten them 
into shape. Press the legs down close to the side, run the truss- 
ing needle directly through the body, bringing it back over the 
leg joints ; tie on one side. Carefully work the skin down over 
the ends of the leg bones and sew the two legs close to the side 
of the breast bone, fastening them to the rump. A fowl prop- 
erly trussed has only three stitches, is perfectly compact and 
will not get out of shape in the cooking. 

Ducks and geese, in fact all poultry or birds, are cleaned in 
precisely the same way. Ducks and geese, however, have gul- 
lets not crops ; they may be loosened at the neck and taken out 
at the lower vent. 

If stuffing is to be used, put it in the carcass, and sew up the 
vents, then truss as directed. 

The "giblets" consist of the liver, heart and gizzard. The 
feet, scalded and skinned, and the neck are added to the giblets. 
To open the gizzard peel off the blue skin. Then remove the 
fleshy part, first on one side, then on the other. Do not cut the 
gizzard into halves and turn it wrong side out, In this way the

second skin is retained, and as it holds digestive secretions, gives 
an unpleasant or unclean odor and taste to the sauce. 

TO ROAST OR BAKE POULTRY. 

One rule will apply equally well to turkey, chicken, goose or 
duck. Follow the general directions for roasting, page 43. 
Have the oven hot until skin is browned, then cool, and if 
stuffed, cook twenty minutes to a pound ; unstuffed fifteen, 
allowing fifteen minutes extra at first for the heating. Baste 
with the fat in the pan every ten minutes; do not add water. 
Serve with unstuffed chicken or turkey one starchy vegetable, 
as plain boiled rice or rice croquettes, or sweet or white potato 
croquettes, a green vegetable, as creamed onions or peas, or 
asparagus, or Jerusalem artichokes or stachys and cranberry or 
barberry sauce, or spiced currants, or sour grape or crab-apple 
jelly. 

CHICKEN en CASSEROLE 

Procure a chicken about one year old ; singe, draw and truss as 
for roasting. Put the chicken in a casserole pot, add a dozen 
small onions, peeled, two bay leaves, a half pint of fancy pieces 
of carrot, a small turnip cut into fancy shapes, a stalk or two 
of celery; partly fill the mold with boiling stock; cover and 
place in a hot oven and cook for an hour and a half ; baste fre- 
quently. When the chicken is half done, add a level teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. If properly cooked 
the chicken will be a dark, rich brown, the stock will have 
evaporated to just sufficient to form a sauce. Mushrooms may 
be added either fresh or canned. The chicken is brought to the 
table in the pot in which it is cooked. 

This recipe will answer for Birds or Pigeons. 



PANNED CHICKEN 

This IS, perhaps, one of the most tasty methods of cooking 
chicken. Draw, singe and disjoint the fowl. Put the pieces 
carefully into a baking pan, add a half pint of water or stock ; 



192 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

dust lightly with pepper. Put the pan into a very hot oven, 
covering with another pan, for fifteen minutes ; then remove the 
cover, sprinkle over the chicken one teaspoonful of salt and a 
saltspoonful of pepper; baste and cook quickly for one hour. 
In a gas stove put the pan underneath the burners in the broil- 
ing chamber; brown the chicken first on one side, then on the 
other. Add the seasoning and put into the oven to finish. Dish 
and add to the pan two tablespoonfuls of butter ; the pan should 
now be dry. Add two tablespoonfuls of flour, mix, and add a 
pint of water or stock ; stir until boiling, add a half teaspoonful 
of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and a teaspoonful of kitchen 
bouquet or browning; take from the fire, add the yolk of one 
egg and strain it over the chicken. 

Garnish the dish with squares or triangular pieces of toast, 
and if you have it, a little finely chopped parsley. Serve with 
this plain, boiled rice, scalloped or baked tomatoes. Pass cran- 
berry or currant jelly. 



RAGOUT OF CHICKEN 

Singe, draw and cut the chicken into joints; put the rough 
pieces and dark meat in the bottom of the saucepan, the white 
mieat on top, flesh side down. Pour over one quart of boiling 
water, cover the saucepan, bring to boiling point, then push to 
the back part of stove, where it will simmer, for thirty minutes. 
Add two bunches of celery cut into pieces a half inch long, a 
level teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper; cover 
and simmer three-quarters of an hour. When the meat is 
tender, dish carefully, putting the rough pieces underneath, 
and cover over the celery. Rub together two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and two of flour. Add the liquor in which the chicken 
was cooked (now one pint), and stir until boiling; take from 
the fire, add the beaten yolks of two eggs, strain this over the 
celery, garnish with baked dumplings and send at once to the 
table. Pass crab-apple or quince jelly. Without dumplings, 
serve with plain boiled rice. 



POULTRY AND GAME 193 

A BROWNED FRICASSEE 

Singe, ^draw and disjoint the chicken. Put two tablespoonfuls 
of butter into a saucepan ; when heated without browning, put 
in the breasts of the chicken flesh side down. When these have 
browned take them out; brown the second joints, wings and 
legs, being very careful not to burn or brown the butter. Now 
add to the butter two tablespoonfuls of flour, mix. Add one 
pint of water or stock, a level teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoon- 
ful of grated onion and two bay leaves ; when boiling add the 
chicken, putting in the rough pieces, rack or bone side down, 
then the dark meat, on top the white meat, flesh side down. 
Cover the saucepan and push it to the back part of the stove 
where it will simmer for an hour. Cook slowly, as it will easily 
scorch. When the chicken is tender, dish, remove the fat from 
the surface and strain the sauce over the chicken. Garnish the 
dish with a little chopped parsley or finely chopped celery tops, 
or the dish may be garnished with squares of toasted bread, or, 
for supper, squares of carefully fried, white corn meal mush. 
For lunch, serve with it boiled rice, or mush bread and mayon- 
naise of celery. Pass currant jelly. 

To dish a ragout or fricassee of chicken put the back in the 
centre of the plate, at the right and left of this the wings, in the 
front toward the carver, cross the legs, back and near the 
wings, the second joints, in the centre on top, the breast; strain 
over the sauce. Put a large bunch of parsley directly in the 
back of the dish. In garnishing with toast or fried mush fill 
in the spaces. 

If chicken is dished in this way, the carver will soon know 
where to find each piece; then, too, the dish has a sort of sys- 
tematic and orderly look. 

BREADED CHICKEN 

Cut a small spring chicken, after it has been cleaned and drawn, 
into four pieces ; dust with salt and pepper, dip them in a beaten 
Qgg, to which you have added a tablespoonful of water, and 
dust thoroughly with fresh bread crumbs, which must not be 
browned. Place the pieces in a baking pan, bone side down, 

13 



194 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

and run into a quick oven until a golden brown. This will take 
about forty minutes. People who have been accustomed to 
fried chicken will think this very nice. Dish neatly and serve 
in a boat sauce Bechamel or cream sauce. 

For supper, serve with them either corn bread or milk bis- 
cuit. For lunch, green peas nicely cooked and daintily seasoned. 

PANNED WHOLE 

For this select spring chickens; singe, remove the head and 
feet, split them down the back and remove the intestines. Wipe 
the chicken inside and out, cross the legs, fold back the wings 
and with a wooden potato masher or cleaver break or flatten 
the breast bone. Place these in a pan, bone side down; dust 
lightly with pepper, baste them all over with melted butter, add 
a half cup of stock and put them in a very hot oven ; baste again 
with melted butter in about fifteen minutes ; dust them with salt 
and cook thirty minutes longer; if the oven is hot, three-quar- 
ters of an hour will brown these nicely and at the same time 
make them tender and thoroughly done. Dish, garnish with 
parsley and pass with them plain cream sauce made in the pan 
in which they were cooked. 

If served for supper, pass also com bread, waffles or milk 
biscuits. For luncheon, peas and cream sauce only.

CREOLE STEW 

Disjoint the chicken after it has been singed and drawn ; put 
two tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan, add three good- 
sized onions cut into thin slices, stir until the onion is cooked 
without browning; now put in the chicken, the rougher pieces 
down, the white meat on top; add a clove of garlic, mashed, 
one-half pint of finely chopped celery, and sufficient strained 
tomato to just cover the chicken, about one quart; bring to 
boiling point and simmer carefully for one hour; this must 
scarcely boil ; add a level teaspoonful of salt, and a half tea- 
spoonful of pepper, or one sweet red pepper, chopped fine ; now 
add one pint of fresh corn cut from the cob or one can of corn ; 
let this heat thoroughly ; dish the chicken in the middle of a 
large platter, put over the corn and sauce. Cover this with 
finely chopped parsley or chives, and send at once to the table. 
Serve with it plain boiled rice, and baked bananas. 

CHICKEN CREAMS 

I pound of cooked chicken ^ can mushrooms

I tablespoonful of flour The whites of three eggs 

I teaspoonful of salt i saltspoonful of pepper 

Chop the chicken very fine, if possible put it twice through a 
meat chopper. Put the mushrooms through at the same time. 
Rub the butter and flour together, add the milk, stir until thick 
and smooth. Take from the fire, and when cool work it grad-

ually into the meat. Press the whole through a sieve and add 
the salt and pepper and the well-beaten whites of eggs. Put 
this mixture into greased tiny individual molds. Stand the 
molds in a steamer or a pan of water in the oven. Cover with 
oiled paper and bake slowly (260° Fahr.) for a half hour; 
serve with creamed mushroom sauce made from the remainder 
of the can of mushrooms. Serve also peas or asparagus tips. 

CHICKEN TIMBALE 

Yi pound of uncooked white i gill (>^ cup) of milk 
meat of chicken Whites of five eggs 

Yi, pint of white, soft bread i level teaspoonful of salt 
crumbs i saltspoonful of pepper 

Put the meat twice through a meat chopper, then rub it until 
perfectly smooth; this may be done in a bowl with a wooden 
pestle or in a mortar. Put the bread and milk into a saucepan, 
stir over the fire until they form a smooth soft paste ; take from 
the fire and when cold add gradually to the meat. Press 
the whole through a sieve, add the salt and pepper, then gradu- 
ally the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Fill into greased tim- 
bale molds and stand in a baking pan, partly filled with boiling 
water ; cover the top with oiled paper and bake in a moderately 
quick oven (about 300° Fahr.) thirty minutes. While these 
are baking make a plain white sauce or cream mushroom sauce, 
pour it in the bottom of the serving dish; turn the timbales 
from the molds and stand them in the sauce ; garnish the edge 
of the dish with a rope of finely chopped parsley, or peas filled 
in around the timbales, or the molds may be garnished with 
finely chopped truffle, mushrooms or green peas. 

It is always wise to line the bottom of the mold with a piece 
of oiled paper ; one can loosen the sides with a knife, but if the 
bottom sticks the appearance of the timbale is spoiled. 

This same mixture may be put into a plain charlotte mold, 
leaving a space in the centre to be filled with creamed mush- 
rooms ; put over the top a layer of the timbale mixture and cook 
it in the oven for three-quarters of an hour. Serve with cream 
mushroom sauce,

CHICKEN CROQUETTES 

All meat croquettes are made precisely the same, with the sea- 
sonings changed to suit the meat. To boil the chicken, cover 
it with boiling water, boil rapidly for five minutes, then push it 
back where it will simmer until tender, one and a half or two 
hours. At the end of the first hour add one onion, stuck with 
twelve cloves, two bay leaves, some finely chopped celery or 
celery seed. The croquettes, will be better if the chicken is 
allowed to cool before chopping. To each three and a half 
pound chicken use a pair of sweetbreads. Wash the sweet- 
breads and boil slowly for three-quarters of an hour ; pick them 
apart, rejecting the membrane; chop them quickly with a silver 
knife and put them aside while you chop the chicken ; this is 
best done in a wooden bowl. Ground meat makes a pasty cro- 
quette. To be perfect they must be creamy, not pasty. Mix 
the sweetbreads with the chopped chicken and measure ; to each 
pint of this allow 

Yz pint of milk 

1 rounding tablespoonful of 

butter 

2 rounding tablespoonfuls of 

flour 

Put the milk over the fire, rub together the butter and flour, 
add the milk and cook until smooth and thick ; add all the sea- 
soning to the meat, mix it with the sauce and turn out to cool. 
When cold, make into pyramid-shaped croquettes, dip in beaten 
CRg"' to which you have added a tablespoonful of warm water ; 
roll in bread crumbs and fry in smoking hot fat (360° Fahr.) 
until a golden brown. Dish on brown paper for a few 
moments, then on a heated platter ; stick a tiny piece of parsley 
in the top of each ; fill the dish with nicely seasoned, cooked 
peas and send at once to the table. Pass with these, mayon- 
naise of celery. If served as an entree at dinner, simply pass 
peas or mushrooms. 

To rewarm chicken croquettes stand them on a piece of soft 
brown paper in the bottom of a baking pan ; place in a quick 
oven for not more than eight minutes, better five. If over- 
heated they will crack and lose their shape. 



I tablespoonful of parsley 
I teaspoonful of onion juice 
I saltspoonful of pepper 
A dash of cayenne 
I saltspoonful of nutmeg 



198 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

If sweetbreads are not at hand, simply measure the chicken 
and follow the recipe. 

Where large quantities of chicken croquettes are to be made, 
the operation will be more easily and quickly done if one quart 
at a time is made and put aside ; one cannot season large quan- 
tities and have them as palatable as the smaller ones. 

For a large entertainment where salad and croquettes are 
both to be served, use the white meat for salad and the dark 
meat for croquettes. For church suppers where money must be 
made and at the same time a dainty supper served, boil a large 
piece of veal With the chickens; chop and use the same as 
chicken meat. Being cooked with the chickens it tastes the 
same. Ten pounds of veal from the leg and two chickens will 
make one hundred and fifty croquettes, at an average cost of 
four cents each. 

CHICKEN SOUFFLE 

This recipe is exceedingly nice for those persons who like a 
delicate dish of chicken and 'cannot eat such fried foods as 
croquettes. Chop cold, cooked chicken very fine ; to each pound 
allow a half pint of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of 
pepper, a teaspoonful of onion juice, and a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley. Add all the seasoning to the meat. Rub the 
butter and flour together, add the cream and stir until boiling; 
take from the fire, mix with the meat. Add the yolks of three 
eggs and then fold in carefully the well beaten whites. Turn 
this at once into a baking dish and bake in a quick oven fifteen 
to twenty minutes. Serve with this mayonnaise of celery, or 
peas. Serve at once, as souffles fall quickly. 

CREAMED CHICKEN 

Cut the white meat of cold boiled chicken into cubes of one-half 
inch ; for home use, both dark and light meats may be used ; for 
pates and paper cases, however, the white meat is to be pre- 
ferred. Measure these blocks and to each pint allow a half can 
of mushrooms cut into quarters and a half pint of white sauce. 
Make the sauce by rubbing together a tablespoonful of butter 



POULTRY AND GAME

and one of flour, add a half pint of milk ; stir until boiling, add 
a level teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of white pepper; 
now add the chicken and mushrooms. Cover and stand over 
hot water for ten minutes, stirring once or twice. 

This mixture is used for the filling of pate shells, bouche 
cases, paper cases, little bread boxes or bread pates, and is 
served for lunch in a border of rice. 

MAYONNAISE OF CHICKEN 

Boil the chickens carefully so that the meat will be tender and 
white. When cold take off each half of the breast in a solid 
piece. Place your hand on top of these pieces and split them 
lengthwise into three slices. Have ready a nicely made mayon- 
naise dressing, colored green by the addition of finely pounded 
parsley; dip each piece of chicken in the mayonnaise, arrange 
them on a cold dish, one overlapping the other, and bring to a 
point in the centre. Garnish the dish with crisp celery or 
lettuce; serve at once. Pass plain celery, brown bread and 
butter. This is a sightly and elegant dish for a summer 
luncheon. 

TURKEY 

For roasting select as first choice a young hen turkey. The legs 
should be black, the skin and flesh white, the breast broad and 
plump. The shorter the neck the better. An old turkey is 
rather broad not plump, legs reddish, and the end of the breast 
bone exceedingly hard. A young gobbler, very nice for roast- 
ing, will have black legs and small spurs. A gobbler is much 
larger than a hen even at the same age, and is consequently less 
economical, as the carcass weighs heavy. Under no conditions 
purchase old poultry, either turkey, chicken, goose or duck. 
The flesh is strong and stringy, has always a surplus of fat 
which it loses in cooking, and even when carefully boiled or 
steamed is not palatable or economical. As soon as a turkey 
comes from the market, singe carefully over a burning gas jet 
or a tablespoonful of burning alcohol. Then wash the skin 



200 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

thoroughly, rinse and wipe it dry. With the cleaver cut off the 
head, leaving a long neck. Cut the skin at the side of the leg 
joint and very lightly over the top. Bend the foot back, loosen- 
ing the ligaments or sinews the same as in a chicken, clean, 
truss and bake or roast the same as chicken. Turkeys are much 
better baked or roasted without stuffing. A turkey stuffed with 
chestnuts is, however, considered a delicacy. 



CAPONS 

Singe, draw and truss the same as chickens. Roast or bake. 
If stuffing is preferred, use oysters or chestnuts. 



DUCKS 

Tame ducks to be well flavored must be penned at least ten 
days before killing. Like chickens they are scavengers and the 
flesh is flavored by the material they eat. We have in the mar- 
ket "celery fed" ducks, ducks fed for a week or more on finely 
chopped celery; this imparts an extremely delicious flavor to 
the flesh. 

TO SELECT. 

A young duck can be readily told by the soft under-bill; in 
bending, it easily breaks ; the lower part of the legs should be 
smooth, and the webbing of the feet soft. They should be suf- 
ficiently fattened to have plump breasts ; overfattened ducks 
are, however, not desirable. Singe the same as chickens. Cut 
off the feet, then the head ; make a vent at the end of breast- 
bone, lengthwise; loosen the gullet at the neck, being careful 
not to break the skin on the breast. From the lower vent loosen 
the intestines, and grasping the gizzard, pull them all out ; 
bring out with them the gullet. In trussing two stitches only 
are required, one to hold the wings back and one to fasten the 
legs down close to the side. The breast bone of a duck or other 
swimming bird, is broad and flat, not pointed as in a chicken, 



^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H 






^J^^^^^M 









Duck Trussed Ready for Baking Page 200 




Showing Trussing on Back Page 200 



POULTRY AND GAME 



201 



hence, the legs come to the side of the body, instead of close to 
the breast. The legs are much shorter than those of walking 
birds. 

TO ROAST OR BAKE. 

Follow directions for roasting. Have the oven very hot (360° 
Fahr.), brown quickly and then cool to 240° Fahr., roasting, if 
stuffed, two hours ; unstuffed, one and a half hours. 

Stuff ducks with plain, mashed potatoes nicely seasoned, 
or with walnut stuffing. Serve with baked or roasted duck, 
currant jelly, or apple sauce or cranberry sauce, and panned, 
baked or stewed tomatoes or turnips. If the duck is unstuffed 
serve sweet or white potatoes or macaroni ; the latter is to be 
preferred. 



SALMI OF DUCK, COOKING SCHOOL STYLE 

Procure a pair of nice young ducks; singe, wash and draw. 
Remove the legs with the second joint and then the wings; 
separate the breast and back, making two pieces of the breast 
and two of the back. Arrange the pieces neatly in a baking 
pan ; sprinkle over them one pint of finely chopped celery, a 
saltspoonful of pepper, and two bay leaves ; dissolve a teaspoon- 
ful of salt in one pint of good stock, chicken stock preferable, 
and bring to boiling point ; pour this over the duck, put the pan 
into a quick oven, cook and baste one and a half hours, turning 
the meat when it is partly done. When the duck is tender the 
pan should be dry. Dish the duck neatly. Add to the pan two 
tablespoon fuls of butter, and two tablespoonfuls of flour, mix, 
add one pint of water or stock ; stir until boiling, add two table- 
spoonfuls of tomato catsup, one-half teaspoonful of salt and a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Have ready one dozen pimolas that 
have been soaked for twenty minutes in hot water. Add these 
to the sauce, and if you like, a half can of mushrooms ; pour 
this over the salmi, gamish with squares of toast, with a little 
pyramid of guava or currant jelly on each, and send at once to 
the table. Those who use wine may add four tablespoonfuls of 
sherry to the sauce. 



202 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

GEESE AND GOSLINGS 

As geese live to a great age and are frequently marketed when 
old, much care must be given to the selecting; they are not 
good when over three years old. A young goose may be 
determined by the soft down on its legs ; the legs are soft and 
yellow, the webbing tender, the under-bill soft and easily 
broken. Geese accumulate fat readily, and even when selected 
with care will have an abundance of fat immediately under- 
neath the skin, hence, the cooking must be done slowly, and also 
for this reason they do not require frequent basting. Singe, 
draw and clean the same as a duck. Like ducks they have no 
crop, the gullet will be loosened and taken out at the lower 
vent with the intestines. Roasting and baking, stuffed or 
unstuffed, are the choice methods of cooking. Of course, they 
are much more wholesome when cooked without stuffing. If 
stuflfed with potatoes, the potatoes absorb the fat, become 
greasy, exceedingly moist and difficult of digestion. Sourkraut 
is to be preferred. Wash the sourkraut once or twice thor- 
oughly, drain and stuff it into the goose. Serve with 
unstuffed goose carefully boiled cabbage, kale, brussels sprouts 
or spinach, and potatoes either white or sweet for the starchy 
vegetables. Pass also some acid sauce as currant jelly, apple 
sauce or pan-baked apples. In the Northern parts of the United 
States barberry jelly, stewed barberries or spiced currants seem 
to be the accepted sauce. Stuffed peppers or pickled walnuts 
are also served. 

In roasting, baste the goose every thirty minutes ; if stuffed, 
roast twenty-five minutes to a pound, without stuffing fifteen 
to eighteen minutes to the pound, cooling the oven as soon as 
the goose is nicely browned. Gosling or. green goose is cooked 
unstuffed and roasted fifteen minutes to a pound. 



GUINEA FOWL 

The flesh of the guinea hen is very unlike that of any other 
barnyard fowl ; it is all dark, corresponding more nearly to the 
flesh of the wild fowls ; the fact is the guineas always remain 



POULTRY AND GAME 



203 



wild, simply tolerating the domesticity to which they are sub- 
jected. They hunt their own food largely through the green 
fields, hence, they do not accumulate fat like domestic fowls, 
which makes them more digestible. They may be stuffed and 
baked, or baked without stuffing, or fricasseed ; the latter is the 
choice method. 

GUINEA FRICASSEE 

Draw, singe and cut up the guineas the same as for fricassee of 
chicken. Put a quarter pound of sliced bacon into a good-sized 
stewing pan, add a half cup of water, boil until the water has 
evaporated and then "try" out the fat carefully, remove the 
cracklings and put in the guinea, turning until carefully 
browned. Add to the fat four tablespoonfuls of flour ; mix and 
add one quart of stock or water, the first always preferable ; 
stir until boiling, add a tablespoonful of chopped onion, just a 
suspicion of garlic, two level teaspoonfuls of salt, two salt- 
spoonfuls of pepper; put in the guinea hens and stew slowly 
one hour ; when done dish, remove any fat that may come to the 
surface of the sauce and strain it over. Garnish the dish with 
squares of fried hominy or triangular pieces of toast. Serve 
potato croquettes, scalloped or baked tomatoes or baked onion, 
or garnish with boiled or baked dumplings. 



PIGEONS 



Pigeons are placed among the domestic fowls and not under 
the head of game. The wings are long and contain very little 
flesh ; the legs are small and tough, but the breasts of young 
pigeons are fat and plump ; as they grow older, being flying 
birds, the muscles become very hard, sometimes rather dense, 
and then the breast grows small and tough. Flying birds, as a 
rule, have small muscular breasts, while walking birds, as 
partridges, have plump, fat breasts. The best method of cook- 
ing a full-grown pigeon is "potting." This gives the moist, 
slow cooking necessary to all tough birds. 



204 

POTTED PIGEONS 

Yi dozen pigeons i pint of stock or water 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter i bay leaf 

1 tablespoonful of flour i good-sized onion 

2 teaspoonfuls of kitchen bou- i tablespoonful of chopped pars- 

quet ley 

I teaspoonful of salt i saltspoonful of pepper 

Singe, draw and wipe the pigeons with a damp cloth, then truss 
them into shape. Put them into a baking pan, rub the breast 
with butter and run them into a quick oven, to brown while you 
make the sauce. Rub the butter and flour together, add 
the stock, stir until boiling, add the kitchen bouquet and all the 
seasonings. Arrange the pigeon in the saucepan, pour over the 
sauce; bring to boiling point and then push to the back part 
of the stt>ve, or put them into the oven and cook slowly for one 
and a half hours. When done, remove the trussing strings, 
arrange the pigeons down the centre of the meat platter and 
strain over the sauce. Pass with them boiled rice and stewed 
onions or tomatoes, peas or asparagus tips. 

SQUABS 

These are young pigeons. Split them down the back, remove 
the intestines, and with a heavy knife or potato masher break 
the breast bone ; wipe them carefully inside and out with a damp 
cloth, and broil the same as spring chicken, or put them into a 
very quick oven and bake for one hour. Serve on toast or 
squares of fried hominy or mush. Pass with them currant 
jelly and green peas. As a light meat course at luncheon, pass 
also boiled rice. 



GAME 

Under this heading we place venison and all wild, undomesti- 
cated animals and birds used as food — wild ducks, geese, par- 
tridges, pheasants, prairie chicken, and such water reptiles 



POULTRY AND GAME 



205 



as terrapin. Being red meat, these birds and animals are 
better if kept before cooking. They may be hung with feathers 
on, but it is desirable to have them "drawn." Do this carefully 
without breaking the intestines or gall, then it is not necessary 
to wipe the inside. Hang in a cold, dry place for a week or 
ten days. 

As all these animals store fat slowly and outside of the lean 
flesh, they are more easily digested than domestic meats, hence, 
best suited to invalids with weak, impaired digestion. 



VENISON 

A venison steak must be broiled at the very last moment and 
sent at once to the table ; a moment's standing or delay makes 
the meat dense and unpalatable. Get everything ready to broil 
or pan the steak, broil quickly, transfer it at once to a heated 
dish and send to the table. Dust simply with salt and pepper. 
Serve with it black or red currant jelly, or guava, or Japanese 
quince jelly. 

IN A CHAFING DISH. 

As delays are dangerous, venison is perhaps better cooked in 
a chafing dish. Have the steak, neatly trimmed, brought to 
the table ; when you are seated light the lamp, let the dish heat 
slowly, put in a little butter and throw in the steak. Turn once 
or twice, dust with salt and pepper, add two tablespoonfuls of 
sherry, and cover the dish for an instant; as soon as the 
materials boil turn the venison once or twice until it is satur- 
ated. Serve. 

It saves time and trouble to cut the steak into convenient 
pieces before cooking. 

TO CURE VENISON. 

Venison may be cured according to the rule for curing mutton 
hams. The meat of the deer being tender, wild and free from 
diseases, will keep longer in coJd places than domestic meats.

WOODSMAN STEW 

Procure for this two pounds of the pieces that are cheap and 

undesirable for roasting or broiling, and cut them into cubes of 
one inch. Put a quarter pound of sliced bacon into a good- 
sized saucepan, cook slowly until all the fat is tried out. 
Remove the cracklings. Dust the venison with one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, throw it into hot fat, stir until nicely browned. 
Draw the meat to one side, add to the fat one tablespoonful 
of flour, mix, and add one pint of boiling stock or water ; stir 
constantly until boiling. Add a clove of garlic, a tablespoonful 
of chopped onion, four tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, one 
teaspoon ful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cover and 
simmer gently for one hour. Then add a grating of the yellow 
rind of a lemon, and if you have it, one teaspoonful of Wor- 
cestershire sauce. Cook thirty minutes; try the meat, if it is 
tender, take it from the fire, if not, cook thirty minutes longer, 
and it is ready to serve. 

Serve with this corn bread, fried mush or fried hominy, 
currant or cranberry jelly and celery or chicory salad. 

WOODSMAN STEW No. 2 

Brown the meat according to preceding recipe; add the flour, 
and then one pint of hard cider ; stir until boiling, add the sea- 
soning as in preceding recipe and finish the same. 



OPOSSUM 

Skin, singe and wipe the opossum inside and out ; hang it for 
several days, provided the weather is clear and the place per- 
fectly cold. Fill with potato or black walnut stuffing, sew up 
the slit, place it in a roasting pan, add one chopped onion, a pint 
of boiling water, one teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Roast and baste for three hours. Have the oven very 
hot at first, and then cool it gently to 240° Fahr. Serve with 
the stuflfed opossum, stewed cabbage, kale, or spinach, and 
either pan-baked apples or apple sauce, and cornbread. 



POULTRY AND GAME 207 

SQUIR.R.ELS 

Squirrels may be cooked after any of the rules given for Bel- 
gian hare. These directions will also answer for common rab- 
bits. Remember, the flesh of rabbits is rather dense and 
requires long, slow cooking to make it digestible. 



WILD TURKEY 

Wild turkey must be drawn, singed and cleaned precisely the 
same as chicken or tame turkey. Wipe inside and out with a 
damp cloth. Truss the turkey into shape at once; dust care- 
fully with pepper, put a teaspoonful of salt in the bottom of the 
pan, and pour in a half cup of boiling water. Place in a very 
hot oven until thoroughly browned. Cool the oven and roast 
slowly fifteen minutes to every pound. 

Wild turkeys are much better without stuffing. Serve with 
them cranberry sauce, boiled onions with cream sauce, sweet 
or white potato croquettes ; pass celery. 



WILD DUCKS 

Heading the list come the canvas-backs, then the red heads, 
mallard, teal, widgeon, black and wood duck. Roast or bake 
quickly without stuffing. Wild ducks are usually preferred 
rare, not raw, and smoking hot. Serve with them lettuce, 
celery or orange salad. Serve a half breast to each person. 
The left-over portions may be used for salmi or soup. 

TO SELECT 

A canvas-back duck has short smooth feathers on the head. 
Head and neck of male are chestnut brown ; the wings and tail 
black with white underneath, the back and sides grayish white. 
The females are duller than the males ; the black markings are 



208 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

very faint. The bills are greenish black and much longer than 
the head, which is rather short and compact ; iris red. 

Canvas-back ducks are sold with feathers on; a well fat- 
tened pair will weigh six pounds. Their companions, the red- 
heads, have longer head feathers, which gives them a sort of 
fluffy appearance ; head, neck, and tail red, the wings black, the 
under part white, the same as canvas-back; the middle back 
and sides grayish black. 

Females are always of duller color than the males ; the bill 
a dull grayish blue, with a black mark across the end, and 
shorter than the head ; the iris yellow. These are also sold with 
the feathers on, a good-sized pair weighing from four and a 
half to five pounds. Both of these ducks are vegetable feeders, 
hence they lack the fishy flavor of the ordinary wild duck. 



BELGIAN HARE 

During the last few years there has been in our markets a 
goodly quantity of Belgian hare. As the **pelt" of Belgian hare 
is valuable (the fur is sold under the name of electric or near- 
seal), it is removed before the animal is exposed for sale; for 
this reason the Belgian hare has been overlooked by the aver- 
age housewife. She is accustomed to buying rabbits with the 
skin on and is not used to the sight of a rabbit with the skin 
off ; she always orders the rabbit ''skinned," but not being a fre- 
quent visitor to her kitchen, has never perhaps seen it "naked." 
For this reason she objects to the market appearance of Bel- 
gian hare. In the western part of the United States, in nearly 
all the hotels, restaurants and private houses, Belgian hare is 
looked upon as a great delicacy. It is canned and sold under 
the name of "boned turkey." The meat is white and compact, 
of fine flavor and tender. They are the cleanest of all animals, 
and being reared for the fur, are well fed and cared for. It is 
said by physicians that broth made from Belgian hare is pre- 
ferable to that made from beef, mutton, or chicken ; that it is 
not so stimulating and slightly nutritious. They may be cooked 
in every way in which one can cook chicken — croquettes,

panned, barbecued, ragout, fried, roasted, stuffed and baked, 
salad and cutlets. The rougher pieces may be put aside for 
stock. 

PANNED BELGIAN HARE 

Split the hare down through the centre ; wipe it carefully with 
a damp cloth, but do not wash it; if there is the slightest 
appearance of fur on the meat, singe it. Now disjoint the hind 
leg and make two pieces of them ; cut off the saddle ; take off the 
fore quarter, making in all nine pieces. Arrange these neatly 
in a baking pan flesh side down. Dust lightly with pepper, add 
one tablespoonful of chopped onion and a bay leaf. Put a tea- 
spoonful of kitchen bouquet into one-half pint of stock or 
water, add one teaspoonful of salt ; stir and pour into the pan. 
Cover with another pan, put into a quick oven and bake one 
and a half hours, basting frequently. A half hour before the 
hare is done remove the upper pan so that each piece may be 
nicely browned. Dish neatly and garnish with triangular pieces 
of toast. To the pan add two tablespoonfuls of flour and two 
of butter; mix and add one pint of stock or water; the pan 
should be dry when the hare is done. Stir the sauce until boil- 
ing, add a half teaspoonful of salt, and if you like, a can of 
mushrooms that have been drained and washed. Pour this over 
the hare, dust with chopped parsley and send at once to the 
table. 

BELGIAN HARE RAGOUT 

Disjoint according to preceding recipe and follow the rule for 
chicken ragout. 

BELGIAN HARE STUFFED AND BAKED 

Singe and wipe the hare. Have ready either a potato or chest- 
nut stuffing ; fill this into the hare, sew it up carefully and put 
into a baking pan ; add to the pan a half cup of stock, one tea- 
spoonful of pepper ; put into a quick oven and bake one and a 
half hours, basting every ten minutes. Turn the hare several 
times while baking. Dish on a deep bed of cress. To carve cut off

the saddle. A hare of g-ood size will weigh from four and a half 
to five pounds, and will serve eight people. Pass with this care- 
fully cooked peas or asparagus tips or string beans. As a sup- 
per dish or for luncheon serve with it a mayonnaise of celery. 
Pass also blaclc currant or guava jelly. 

BELGIAN HARE SALAD 

Clean and singe the hare, cut it into three pieces, put them into 
a kettle ; add slices of onion, a bay leaf and cover with boiling 
water ; boil rapidly for five minutes, then simmer gently for one 
hour and a half. Finish precisely the same as chicken salad. 

BELGIAN HARE CUTLETS 

Boil the hare the same as for salad. Then follow the recipe for 
chicken croquettes, using the water in which the hare was 
boiled instead of milk. When cold form into cutlet-shaped cro- 
quettes, dip and fry. Serve with either brown or tomato sauce 
and pass peas or mayonnaise of celery. 

FILLETS OF HARE a la CASTILLANE 

Singe and wipe with a damp cloth one Belgian hare. Take oflF 
the hind legs, make two pieces of each, divide the saddle in 
three, cutting right across the hare ; make one fillet from each 
front leg; save the rougher pieces and a portion of the carcass 
for stock. Put the fillets into shape ; it is not necessary to bone 
them. Brush them thoroughly with a mixture of two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter and four of sherry; let them stand 
for two to three hours; dip them in beaten egg to which you 
have added one tablespoon ful of water; roll them in bread 
crumbs and plunge them into hot fat ; as soon as they are brown 
push the pan to one side of the stove where the cutlets will cook 
slowly for about twenty to thirty minutes. While these are 
cooking make a large square croiiton from the centre of a 
loaf of bread. Dip in beaten egg to which you have added 
a tablespoonful of milk. Make a brown mushroom or tomato 
sauce. Pour the s^uce in the bottom of the dish; lift the 



POULTRY AND GAME 



211 



hare from the oil or fat, and rest it on brown paper for a 
moment to drain. Plunge the crouton into the hot fat, brown 
quickly, put it to one end of the platter; arrange the hare 
neatly against it. Put the mushrooms at one end around the 
hare and garnish the croiiton with a hatlet skewer on which 
you have placed mushrooms, radish, olive or pieces of truffle. 
Add parsley here and there and send at once to the table. 

This recipe will also answer for Fried Sweetbreads, 
French Fried Chicken or Duck. 



STUFFINGS 

PLAIN BREAD STUFFING 

Cut from the loaf slices of bread a half inch in thickness ; but- 
ter them carefully. Trim off the crusts which put aside for 
drying and rolling purposes, or they may be used for scalloped 
dishes. Cut the bread into dice, add to each quart one table- 
spoonful of parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful 
of pepper. Mix thoroughly and it is ready for use. This will 
be sufficient for one chicken. 

For a turkey make twice this quantity ; the bread must not 
be moistened or it will be soggy at the end of the cooking. 

For Onion Stuffing or Dressing, add to the preceding 
recipe two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion. 

For Oyster Dressing, add twenty-five oysters after they 
have been drained and washed. 

For Celery Dressing, add a half pint of finely chopped 
celery. If this is not at hand, sprinkle over it a teaspoonful of 
celery seed. 

TOMATO STUFFING 

This is made from plain bread stuffing, adding four tomatoes, 
peeled, seeds squeezed out, and flesh chopped fine. 

CHESTNUT STUFFING 

Shell one quart of large chestnuts and scald them until the 
brown skins have softened ; drain, turn them on a coarse towel, 
cover with another towel and rub with the hands until they are 
blanched. Wash, cover with fresh boiling water and cook 
slowly until they are tender. Drain and chop rather fine, or 
they may be mashed through a colander. Add a level teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, a rounding tablespoonful 
of butter, melted ; mix, and the dressing is ready for use, 
212 



STUFFINGS 



213 



To make Mushroom Stuffing, add one can of drained, 
washed mushrooms, chopped fine, to the preceding recipe. 

To make Truffle Stuffing, add four truffles washed and 
chopped very fine. 

POTATO STUFFING 

Pare one pound of potatoes; throw them into boihng water, 
and boil until tender. Drain and sprinkle over them one tea- 
spoonful of salt, shake over the fire until dry ; put them through 
a vegetable press or colander; add a saltspoonful of pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls of grated onion and one tablespoon ful of 
butter, melted, or two tablespoonfuls of cream. Mix thor- 
oughly and use for ducks and geese. 

POTATO WITH CELERY 

Follow the above directions and add a half pint of finely 
chopped celery instead of onion. 

SAGE STUFFING 

Add two tablespoonfuls of sage to plain potato stuffing, and 
omit the onion. Or make a plain bread stuffing, and add two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sage. This is used for the stuffing 
of roasted pig. 

WALNUT STUFFING 

Make a potato stuffing, omit the onion and add a half pint of 
chopped English or black walnuts. This dressing is used for 
tame ducks and rabbits. 

SAUSAGE STUFFING 

Yz pound of sausage meat i tablespoonful of onion juice 
Yz pint of bread crumbs i tablespoonful of parsley 
I teaspoonful of pepper 

Mix well all the ingredients, and use for chicken or turkey. 
These heavy dressings are, however, not to be recommended; 
in fact all poultry is far better without stuffing. 



MEAT SAUCES 



When one becomes perfectly familiar with the philosophy of a 
sauce, all sauces are quickly and easily made, and without con- 
tinual reference to written recipes. A rounding tablespoonful 
of flour weighs a half ounce. A rounding tablespoonful of but- 
ter or fat, one ounce. These two measurements are used to 
each half pint of liquid; if the fat is measured melted, two 
tablespoon fuls will be counted as one. If you are making 
tomato sauce, for instance, use one tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour rubbed together, then add a half pint of strained 
tomato. For a white or cream sauce, the same measurement of 
butter and flour, one tablespoonful of each rubbed together 
and a half pint of milk, and so changing the liquid one may 
make many sauces. In making roasted beef gravy, pour the 
fat from the pan, reserving the given quantity. Here the fat 
will be liquid or melted, as it is hot; use two tablespoonfuls 
with one rounding tablespoonful of flour, and a half pint of 
water or stock. Always rub the fat and flour together, add the 
liquids cold, unless otherwise directed, and stir until they reach 
the boiling point. In this way the flour is most thoroughly 
cooked and not rendered indigestible as when cooked in the fat. 
Butter and flour cooked together form a very objectionable 
compound. 

When fat comes to the surface of a sauce, too much fat has 
been used. Under all circumstances the fat must be rubbed 
with the flour, the liquid then added, otherwise you will have a 
greasy, separated sauce. If the sauce boils after it has once 
reached the boiling point it will also separate. It must be 
strained at once into the gravy bowl or kept over warm or hot 
water. A brown sauce may be colored with caramel, burnt 
onion or kitchen bouquet. A brown sauce must be brown, a 
white sauce, white, and a yellow sauce, yellow.

Rib Roast Page 23] 




Sirloin Roast Page 231 




Rolled Roast Page 232 



CARVING 

When putting a piece of meat into shape, use a trussing needle 
and white twine. These will be easily removed after the cook- 
ing. If skewers must be used, steel ones are preferable, as they 
are easily seen and removed before the meat is sent to the table. 
Wooden skewers are an abomination, and should not be used 
under any circumstances. 

RIB ROAST 

As beef is served almost every day in the average American 
home, we will discuss first the common rib roast, the flavor 
of which is spoiled by the removal of the bones. Chop oflF 
a portion of the lower rib, and "top" the roast. Place the 
meat, bone side down, in the roasting pan. It requires no 
fastenings of any sort. When done, dish the joint on a large 
platter; good carving cannot be done in cramped quarters. 
Garnish one end of the platter with a large bunch of parsley 
or crisp celery tops. 

First cut off the upper part from A to B, then run the 
knife at C close to the ribs, loosen the meat from the bone 
and around the butt end to B. Next cut off the outside 
slices, D to E, and place it on one side of the dish. Then 
cut thin slices, drawing the knife toward you. 

SIRLOIN ROAST 

To carve a sirloin roast, first cut out the tenderloin, A to B, close 
to the bone; next remove end, C to D; then remove the 
sirloin, cutting close to the bone, from E to F. Slice the 
meat across the grain, beginning at E; the tenderloin from 
the bone to B. In serving ask preference, as many persons 
do not like tenderloin. Serve to those wishing fat, a thin 
slice from the upper end. 

2S1 



232 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

FILLET OF BEEF 

A fillet or tenderloin of beef is universally served with mush- 
room sauce. In the head or butt of the fillet, stand a fancy 
skewer garnished with mushrooms, truffles and olives. Gar- 
nish this end of the platter with curly parsley or cress, and 
pour around the mushroom sauce; cut in thick slices directly 
across the fillet, beginning at the large end. 

SIRLOIN STEAK 

Garnish a broiled sirloin steak with French fried potatoes, 
and slices of lemon covered thickly with finely chopped parsley ; 
or at the head of the dish place a bunch of fresh curly parsley, 
studded with tiny red radishes. To carve, first run the knife 
close to the bone, removing the tenderloin ; then on the other 
side, removing the sirloin. Carve the meat from the bone 
to the edge, serving a thin slice of tenderloin and sirloin 
to each person, not forgetting the gravy. 

Carve a Round Steak in thin strips across the grain. 

Garnish a Rolled and Braised Steak with tomato sauce, 
and finely chopped parsley. Carve across the roll, the same 
as a fillet, cutting it in thin even slices. 

BONED RIB ROAST 

Dish a "rolled" roast, as shown in cut. To carve, cut first 
a thin slice from the outside, and then cut thin even slices, 
drawing the knife from A to B toward you. 

BEEF a la MODE 

Dish beef a la mode on a large platter. Garnish a silver 
skewer with a ball of carrot, a radish, a ball of turnip, and, 
if you have it, a mushroom, and stick it through the centre 
of the beef. Fill the bottom of the dish with rich brown 
sauce; garnish the ends of the platter with pieces of carrot 
and turnips cut into fancy shapes, and small pieces of stewed 




Larded and Cooked Fillet Page 232 




Saddle of Mutton Page 233 



CARVING 233 

celery. Around the edge of the sauce, where it meets the 
dish, put a thick rope of finely chopped parsley. Stick a fork 
into one side of the beef and cut a thick slice from the top, 
and then cut the meat across in thin slices, the same as rolled 
beef, serving fat and lean together. 

FRESH BEEF TONGUE 

Dish the tongue in the centre of a large platter, fill this 
with brown sauce, and garnish with the vegetables that have 
been used in the braising. Carve by cutting directly across, 
beginning at the thick or butt end of the tongue. Serve at 
each helping a portion of the underneath fat, some of the 
vegetables and sauce. 

BEEF HEART 

Place the heart in the centre of the platter, removing carefully 
the strings and skewers. Fill the bottom of the dish with 
nicely boiled kidney beans or flageolets and pour over brown 
sauce. Where the sauce and the plate come together, put 
a row of small triangular pieces of toasted bread. Carve in 
thin slices directly across, beginning at the tip. 

SADDLE OF MUTTON 

This is, perhaps, one of the most difficult pieces of meat to 
carve well. Before cooking, the flank should be folded under, 
the tail turned over the back, and the whole fastened into 
shape. When cooked, place it on a handsome bed of cress 
in a large platter. Stud the cress here and there with ripe 
olives or round balls of winter radishes cut with a vegetable 
scoop. Make a long cut parallel with and near the back- 
bone from A to B ; stick the fork in the opening and cut thin 
slices the entire length of the saddle. Give each piece a little 
twirl as you put it on the plate, making it compact. Turn 
the saddle, cut out the kidneys and the tenderloin ; then cut 
the crisp fat at the ribs, from C to D, in thin slices. At each 
helping serve a piece of the kidney and fat with the lean 
meat. Pass plain brown or mushroom sauce. 



234 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

LOIN OF MUTTON 

See that the loin' is well cracked at each rib before cooking. 
Dish with the skin side up, and garnish the platter with a 
thick ring of curly parsley. Cut through from A to B at 
each joint. Serve one rib at each helping. 

A Loin of Veal is carved in precisely the same manner. 

LEG OF MUTTON 

Dish the leg fleshy side up, and small bone to the left of the 
plate; garnish with cress and trim the end bone with a quill 
of paper. Stick the carving fork far down into the knuckle 
end at O, drawing the leg toward you ; then insert the knife 
at A, and cut directly down to the bone at B. Continue to 
slice the meat down to the bone until you reach the larger 
bone at the fleshy end of the leg; then run your knife, cut- 
ting from C to D along the bone, loosening all slices as indi- 
cated in the illustration. 

A Haunch of Venison is carved the same. Garnish the 
dish with cress, or celery tips. 

SHOULDER OF MUTTON 

A shoulder of mutton is much more complicated than the 
leg. Place it, bone side down, on the platter; garnish this 
with cress, or chicory and pimolas. Trim the shank bone 
with a quill of paper. Insert the carving fork at the knuckle 
end at O, and pull the shoulder over. Begin to carve from 
A to B, cutting all the slices down to the same point ; at last, 
with a twist of the knife, cut and remove them all. The 
flesh is wedge-shaped. Now cut the flesh on top of the 
bone from this opening to C. At the lower part of the 
shoulder, cut the fat in thin slices from D to E. Serve a 
bit of fat with each slice of lean meat. 

Carve a stuffed shoulder in thin slices directly across the 
roll, beginning at the small end.

LAMB 

Lamb is sold by the quarter, the fore quarter being first choice. 
Have the bones thoroughly cracked before roasting; when 
done place the joints on a large platter, skin side down. Gar- 
nish the platter with young cress studded here and there with 
little red spring radishes. To carve the fore quarter, cut 
down through each rib and then cut thin slices from the 
shoulder. Cut the hind quarter through the loin, and thin 
slices from the leg. At each helping serve a portion of lean 
and fat. 

A CUSHION OF VEAL 

Dish, garnish, carve and serve precisely the same as beef 
a la mode. 

TURKEY OR CHICKEN 

Place the turkey or chicken so that the breast will be at the 
left hand of the carver. Insert the carving fork at the small 
end of the breastbone, O, plunging it down so as to gain good 
command. First cut off the leg with the second joint, A to 
B ; then the wings C to D on the side farthest from you. Tip 
the turkey from you, and take off the leg and wing from 
the side toward you. Next carve thin slices from each side 
of the breast, in directions indicated, from the lines E to 
F. Then remove the wish-bone from the carcass by cutting 
from G to H. Cut through the ribs from H to I, first on 
one side, then on the other. With a quick turn of the knife, 
divide the front or breast from the back of the carcass. Now 
remove the fork, which has not been withdrawn from first 
to last. Divide the second joint from the drumsticks, and 
make two pieces of each. Then divide the back, lower and 
upper half, at the second rib joint. The turkey is now ready 
for serving. At each helping give a portion of the dark 
and white meat unless a preference is expressed. 

Where the family is small the whole turkey need not be 
carved; cut the necessary quantity from one side only. If 
the turkey is stuffed, make an opening from J to K suffi- 




236 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

ciently large to allow the entrance of a tablespoon. Garnish 
the plate at the breast end of the turkey with a large bunch 
of parsley studded with olives or pimolas. Decorate the leg 
bones with quills of paper, and underneath the rump put 
another bunch of parsley. 

Capons and Wild Turkey are carved in the same manner. 



DUCK 

These directions will answer also for Goose. 

Place the duck on the platter, the breast toward the left 
hand; garnish with celery tips or cress. Goose is usually 
garnished with sourkraut. Plunge the fork in the lower part 
of the breastbone at O ; remove the leg, cutting from A to 
B, then the wing from C to D. Turn the duck, remove the 
leg and* wing from the opposite side. Next cut the breast 
into slices from E to F. Make a slash from G to H suffi- 
ciently large to help the stuffing, and remove the fork. Serve 
a sHce of the breast and a little stuffing at each helping. 

Ducks are much more difficult to carve than chickens or 
turkeys. It requires considerable dexterity, even by an experi- 
enced carver, to furnish more than four fine cuts from either 
a duck or goose. 

Serve only the breasts of wild ducks; leave the remain- 
ing portion to be served in timbale or salmi for next day's 
luncheon. 

BROILED CHICKEN 

Garnish broiled chicken with blocks of guava jelly on tiny 
rounds of fried or toasted bread. In between, place a small 
bunch of curly parsley. 

Broiled or panned chickens are split down the back before 
cooking. To carve, insert the fork in the breastbone, and 
cut the chicken into halves, then into quarters. Garnish 
panned chicken with tiny sweet potato pyramid croquettes 
and corn fritters.

Boned Chicken in Jelly, Cold Page 237 



CARVING 237 

BONED CHICKEN 

A boned chicken or turkey, in fact, any boned fowl, when 
served hot, should be garnished with cream sauce and mush- 
rooms. Insert the fork in the middle of what would be the 
breastbone, and cut in thin slices, beginning at the neck end. 

BIRDS 

Woodcock, plover and snipes are all served in the same man- 
ner. Garnish with cress, and tiny bread patties filled with 
guava jelly. Serve a whole bird at each helping. 

To carve the larger game, as pheasants or prairie chickens, 
cut down through the breastbone from A to B, dividing them 
into halves. Serve one half at a helping. 

Small birds, such as reed or rail birds, grouse, or quail, 
are always served whole. Broiled or panned quail are split 
down the back before cooking. Serve on slices of toasted 
bread or fried mush, and garnish with parsley. Serve a 
whole bird with accompanying toast or mush at each helping. 

Small birds, such as reed birds or rail birds, are frequently 
served in cases. Cut off the ends of a white or sweet potato, 
scoop out the centre, and place the bird inside to roast. Dish 
the potato with head sticking out, and garnish with cress. 
Reed birds may also be dished in onion cups. Cut the onions 
into halves, throw them into salted water and cook until per- 
fectly tender ; take out the centres, and arrange the cups neatly 
on a platter on squares of toast with a reed bird in each ; the 
ends of the platter may be garnished with white celery tops 
and olives. 

RABBITS AND HARES 

If roasted and served whole, these are arranged in a sort of 
kneeling position, pressed down into a bed of mashed potatoes 
or cress; the latter is to be preferred. Stick the fork in the 
middle of the back, remove the hind quarter and the shoulder 
from one side; then tilt the rabbit without removing the 
fork, and cut the joints from the side toward you. Make three 
pieces of the back, before removing the fork; then divide the 



238 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

two joints of the hind legs, making nine pieces. The saddle 
and the second joints of the hind leg are the choice pieces. 

As Belgian hares are much larger than ordinary rabbits, 
the saddle may be divided into halves. One Belgian hare 
will serve eight people. 

SUCKING PIG 

After the pig is roasted stand it in a deep bed of cress in the 
centre of a large platter. Remove the cork from the mouth, 
and put in its place a small red apple. Dot the cress here 
and there with quarters of unpared red apples or tiny button 
radishes. To carve, first remove the head, A to B, then the 
ham, C to D, next the shoulder, E to F, on the side toward 
you. Tilt the pi 5^ slightly, and remove the ham and shoulder 
from the opposite side. Now make a cut the entire length 
of the belly, G to H, exposing the stuffing. Next cut thin 
slices of meat from I to J, remove the fork and carve the 
head. Take off the ears first; then sever the lower jaw, 
carving little slices to the bone. Next cut the ham ; then the 
shoulder, just as you would a leg and shoulder of mutton. 
In serving give each person a piece of lean meat from the 
leg and a piece of fat meat from the body and a little stuffing. 
As many persons prefer a portion of the head, ear, or lower 
jaw, it is well to ask preference. 

FISH 

Boiled and baked fish are carved in the same manner. Use 
always a silver knife and fork; steel spoils the flavor of the 
fish. Garnish with parsley and quarters of lemons. To 
carve, first cut off the head from A to B ; then run the knife 
through the fish as close to the backbone as possible from C 
to D. Cut the upper half into slices or pieces as indicated 
by the dotted lines. After serving the upper portion, loosen 
the backbone and turn it to the back part of the plate. Cut 
and serve the under side, the same as you did the upper. 

Planked or broiled fish are cut through the backbone. Be 
careful, however, to strike the joints, breaking them quickly; 
otherwise the flesh of the fish is mashed, and both the flavor 
and appearance are spoiled.

SERVING 

THE PROPER COMBINATIONS OF MEATS AND 
VEGETABLES 

Beside the hygienic combinations of vegetables with meats, there 
is an aesthetic side, of equal importance. While mutton and 
potatoes are not, perhaps, an unwise combination, they cer- 
tainly are not an attractive one. In the eternal fitness of 
things, we fall into conventional ways which frequently are 
more or less correct. From observations of what other people 
do, always copying those in advance of ourselves, we oft- 
times live better than we know. 

A well cooked and well served dinner implies not only 
a thorough knowledge of cookery, but also of housewifery 
and the duties of a hostess. The real artist puts both heart 
and mind into every dish. It blends with the seasons, it is 
suited to the occasion, and harmonizes with the general 
manner of living. Simple foods well served are always 
attractive and elegant. A dish of roasted beef, simple and 
plain, becomes elegant when well cooked, neatly arranged and 
garnished on a pretty platter, and served with the appropriate 
vegetables. Wise combinations please first the eye, then the 
palate, then the stomach. Indulgence, however, often leads 
to overfeeding, and this to a lack of thought regarding the 
quality as well as the quantity of food ingested. 

For many years, greens such as parsley, chervil, cress, 
lettuce and celery, have been the accepted decorations for 
meat and game platters, but the ugly and conventional ring 
of greens around every meat dish has been entirely abolished 
for the more dainty colorings. A dish of braised birds is no 
longer found in a wreath of cress, but is daintily gamished 
with tiny almond croquettes, piled cannon-ball fashion at the 
sides or ends, with here and there a dainty bread patty hold- 
ing a teaspoonful of jelly, and witli handsome sprigs of 



240 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

parsley at the head of each bird. Different shades of brown 
with the green are exceedingly beautiful. Avoid combina- 
tions of bright colors, save with few exceptions. Potato salad 
garnished with chopped red beets, or lobster cutlets garnished 
with the brilliant claws of the lobster, are natural and 
attractive. 

SOUPS 

Pass bread or bread sticks with all clear soups. 

Delicate crackers with oysters, clam or lobster soups. 

Grated Parmesan with macaroni soup. 

Celery, radishes or olives with all meat soups. 

Small croutons with puree of tomato, peas, lentils or beans. 

Large croiitons with bouillabaisse or chowders. Sea bis- 
cuits or hard water crackers are usually preferred with fish 
chowders. 

RAW SHELL-FISH 

Serve oysters and clams very cold on their own deep under 
shells, pressed down into a plate of cracked ice; in the centre 
of each plate put half a lemon. Pass horseradish and tobasco 
sauce, and long oyster crackers, or brown bread and butter. 

With broiled oysters, pass toast and brown sauce. 

With fried oysters, cabbage salad with French dressing. 

With boiled lobsters, serve lettuce or a mixed French 
salad with French dressing. 

With deviled crabs, sauce tartare and bread. 

With lobster farci, sauce tartare and bread. 

With broiled lobster, French rolls and lettuce salad. 

FISH 

With planked fish, potato puff and cucumbers with French 
dressing. 

With broiled fish, creamed potatoes and cucumbers with 
French dressing. 

With baked fish, fried potato balls and cucumbers with 
French dressing. 

With boiled fish, sauce Hollandaise, boiled potato balls 
with parsley sauce, and cucumbers with French dressing.

With small fish fried, sauce tartare and li^it crisp bread. 

With fish croquettes and cutlets for luncheon or supper, 
warm crisp rolls and potato roses. 

With fried halibut steaks for lunch, cucumbers with French 
dressing, graham bread and coffee. 

With creamed or deviled fish, cucumber sauce and crisp 
bread. 

With salt cod, boiled potatoes, parsnips, and sour milk 
biscuit, or brown bread. 

With creamed cod for lunch or supper, serve plain boiled 
potatoes. 

With salt mackerel, fried mush or corn bread. 

With fish timbales with cream, lobster, shrimp or oyster, 
crab sauce and a garnish of tiny potato balls. 

Sweets should not be served with or after a fish dinner, 
supper or luncheon. 

ENTREES 

Patties are served alone„ 

Timbales in general, with cream sauce and peas, mush- 
rooms, or truffles, pass crisp bread. 

Croquettes with peas. 

Boudins with peas and a delicate sauce. 

Almost all entrees are served with an appropriate sauce and 
crisp bread. 

ROASTS 

Serve with the meat course one starchy vegetable and one 
green or succulent vegetable. When the dinner salad is served 
with the meat course, let it take the place of the succulent or 
green vegetable. 

BEEF 

Do not serve, at a private table, two starchy vegetables with 
the same course ; nor the same one at two courses at the same 
meal. For instance, do not serve sweet and white potatoes 
together; serve one or the other, and do not serve potatoes 
with the meat if they have been served with the fish,

EGGS 



The egg of the domestic fowl, the one in common use, and the 
only one to be considered here, is a typical or perfect food ; 
that is, it contains all the elements of the blood and is capable 
of supporting perfectly the young chick in its development. It 
is not, however, a typical or perfect food for the human adult, 
and when eaten by such is placed among the nitrogenous foods, 
and served with such fatty materials as breakfast bacon, with 
oil in salad dressings, or with white bread and butter. 

In arranging bills of fare, perfect dietaries, it is well to com- 
pare the analyses of egg, meat and milk. Study carefully the 
quantity of nitrogen, carbon, and also the amount of mineral 
matter in each. 

Bauer calls especial attention to the mineral matter of eggs, 
milk and flesh. The latter is rich in potassium, phosphoric and 
sulphuric acids, but contains little sodium, calcium or chlorine, 
while milk is rich in calcium and chlorine, and eggs in iron, 
sodium, and phosphoric acid. Keep before you these analyses, 
and count up for yourself the proportion of each ingredient 
before arranging the bills of fare. To make a perfect diet, mix 
with these, carbonaceous foods and such vegetables as go to 
make up the loss of certain elements and mineral matter in them. 
Ten eggs of medium size weigh a pound. Eggs, being nitro- 
genous, are muscle building foods, and are principally digested 
in the stomach. They are easily digested raw ; not difficult of 
digestion when simply cooked. Hard boiled eggs, however, are 
to be rejected by persons with weak digestion. According to 
Yco the following analysis is correct : 

White of Egg Yolle 

Water 84.8 51.5 

Albuminates 12.0 15.0 

Fats 2.0 30.0 

Mineral matter 1.2 1. 4 

Pigment extractives — 2.x 

247 



248 

It will be noticed that the yolk and white differ in composi- 
tion. The yolk contains less water, a small amount of sulphur, 
fatty matter and proteid materials known as globulin, while the 
white of the egg is chiefly a solution of albumin. In feeding 
children it is frequently found that the yolk of hard boiled egg 
will agree better than the whole of soft boiled egg. 

The beaten white of egg is used frequently in place of bak- 
ing-powder or yeast as a leavening agent; it does not act 
chemically upon the materials with which it is mixed; the 
membrane being tough, has the power of holding the air 
beaten into it; it is then mixed with a batter, and at once 
cooked. In this way the air cells are fixed by the heat, which 
gives the light appearance, as in sponge cake or soufflees. 

Do not jar the stove while these Hght dishes are cooking, or 
the cells will break. 

To ascertain the freshness of an egg without breaking it, 
fold your hand around and hold the egg between the sun 
or bright light and yourself; look through it. If the yolk 
appears round and the white clear it is fresh ; or you may drop 
it into a bucket of water ; if perfectly fresh it will sink and fall 
on its side. If it topples around in the water, standing on its 
end, it is fairly fresh. If it floats beware of it. The shell of a 
fresh egg looks dull and porous, that of an old egg thin and 
shiny. When eggs are kept any length of time there is a loss 
of water by evaporation through the pores of the cells. This 
will cause the egg to rattle in the shell. An egg that rattles 
may be perfectly good. It must be tested in some other way 
before being condemned. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS 

To preserve eggs it is only necessary to close the pores of the 
shell. This may be done by dipping them in melted suet, or 
packing them in salt, the small ends downward, using a goodly 
quantity of salt between each layer of eggs. Or they may be 
packed in brine; salt, however, is to be preferred. Eggs may 
also be kept in lime water, packing them carefully, small ends 
down, using sufficient water to thoroughly cover. This not 
only protects them from the air, but acts as a germicide. Eggs 




EGGS 249 

should be packed not later than the middle of May nor earlier 
than the first of April. Eggs may be placed in cold storage and 
kept at an even temperature of 40° Fahr. ; when taken from 
this temperature they must be used at once. They will not 
keep in a warm temperature in good condition twenty-four 
hours. 

Eggs may also be evaporated, and kept in glass bottles or 
jars. Separate the whites and yolks, spread a few at a time 
on a clean stoneware or china platter and slowly evaporate or 
dry in a very cool oven. When the mixture is fine and perfectly 
dry it is ready to put away. This powder is capable of taking 
up the same amount of water that has been evaporated from it, 
and may then be used the same as fresh eggs. 

SHIRRED EGGS 

Cover the bottom of individual dishes with fresh bread crumbs, 
drop into each dish one fresh egg. Cover the top with 
crumbs, stand the dishes in a pan of hot water, and cook in the 
oven until set, like a poached egg. Put a tiny bit of butter and 
a dusting of salt and pepper over each, and send at once to the 
table. 

EGGS ON A PLATE 

Rub the bottom of a stoneware platter with butter, dust lightly 
with salt and pepper. Then break over the top of the dish six 
fresh eggs ; sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper ; put bits of 
butter the size of a hazel nut between each egg, and stand the 
dish over a basin of hot water. Cook in the oven about five 
minutes or until the eggs are set. 

If you have a gas stove run them under the flame for just 
a moment to bro,wn the surface. 

EGG TIMBALES 

Butter small dariole or timbale molds and sprinkle them 
thickly over the bottom and sides with chopped tongfue and 
finely chopped mushrooms. Break into each mold one or two 
resh eggs ; put a little piece of butter on the top of each, stand 



260 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

the molds in a baking pan half filled with boiling water. Cover 
the tops with oiled paper, and cook in the oven until the eggs 
are set. Take them out, loosen the sides with a knife, turn each 
mold out on a round of nicely toasted bread ; arrange these on 
a heated platter, and pour around tomato or cream sauce. 
Garnish the dish with nicely seasoned green peas. Serve as 
second course at lunch or dinner. 

CURRIED EGGS 

Peel and cut into very thin slices three large onions. Put them 
with two tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan ; stand this 
in a pan of hot water and cook until the onions are a soft 
golden yellow. Now add a teaspoonful of curry powder, one 
clove of garlic mashed, one-fourth teaspoonful of ground 
ginger, a half teaspoonful of salt, and a tablespoonful of flour. 
Mix thoroughly and add a half pint of stock or water. Stir 
until boiling and stand the sauce over hot water while you pre- 
pare the eggs. Hard boil six eggs ; cut them into thin slices 
crosswise ; arrange them around a mound of rice on a hot plat- 
ter, drain over the curry sauce, and send at once to the table. 

This dish is made still more attractive by garnishing the 
edge with carefully cooked sweet peppers. 

EGGS STEAMED IN THE SHELL 

Eggs put into hot water, the water kept away from the fire, 
are much better than when they are boiled carefully even two 
minutes. The greater the number of eggs, the greater the 
amount of water. To cook four eggs, put them into a kettle, 
l)our over two quarts of boiling water ; cover the kettle, allow 
them to stand ten minutes. Drain off this water, put the eggs, 
into a large bowl or dish, cover again with boiling water and 
send to the table. The white will be coagulated, but soft and 
creamy, and the yolk perfectly cooked. If you should add six 
eggs to this volume of water, allow them to stand fifteen min- 
utes. A single egg may be dropped into a quart of boiling 
water, the kettle covered and in eight minutes it will be ready 
to serve.

EGGS 261 

SOFT BOILED EGGS 

This term is usually applied to eggs boiled for two minutes. 
The whites, however, are a little tough near the shell. Steamed 
eggs are to be preferred. 

POACHED OR DROPPED EGGS 

Select an ordinary saute or shallow frying pan ; partly fill it 
with boiling water. Select perfectly fresh eggs. The white 
is held in a membrane, which seems to lose its tenacity after 
the egg is three days old ; so to poach an egg perfectly it must 
be fresh. Take the desired number of eggs and a saucer to the 
stove; break an egg into the saucer, slide it quickly into the 
boiling water, pull the pan to the side of the stove where the 
water cannot possibly boil. Continue dropping in the eggs until 
you have the pan full. Now with a spoon, baste the water over 
the yolk so that it is entirely covered with a little thin veil of 
white. Lift each with an egg slice or skimmer ; trim off the 
ragged edges, making the dropped egg an oblong shape, with 
the yolk in the centre. Slide it on a piece of buttered toast, and 
send at once to the table. 

The toast should be made quickly, the crust or edge rolled 
in boiling water at the very last moment. 

TO HARD BOIL AN EGG 

It becomes necessary frequently to hard boil eggs for garnish- 
ing certain made dishes. Put the eggs into warm water ; bring 
the water to about 200° Fahr. and keep it there for thirty min- 
utes. Eggs cooked in this way will be hard, the yolks mealy and 
dry, not tough, the whites solid, yet tender. Throw them at 
once into cold water and remove the shells. Eggs allowed to 
cool in the water in which they were boiled are dark and yellow. 

EGGS COOKED AT TABLE 

Many persons prefer to have the eggs cooked at table in the 
ordinary egg cooker, as it seems almost impossible to have uni- 



252 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

form results when the eggs are cooked in the kitchen. Exact 
results can never be expected when conditions are constantly 
varying. To-day the water is actually boiling. To-morrow 
it is nearly boiling. Perhaps the next day it is only 180° Fahr., 
and still the cook proceeds in precisely the same way each time. 
One day the eggs are raw; another day, hard; another day, 
medium. An tgg cooker removes this difficulty, and enables 
one to thoroughly control the conditions, and have uniform 
results. 

Fill the under portion of the cooker up to the "mark" with 
boiling water. Fill the small side of the lamp with alcohol. 
Put in six eggs ; cover, light the alcohol, and do not uncover 
the vessel until the alcohol has been entirely consumed. Lift 
the cover and the eggs will be perfectly done. 



EGGS a la MARTIN 

2 tablespoonfuls of Parmesan or 3^ pint of cream sauce 
4 tablespoonfuls of common 6 eggs 

cheese 

Put two tablespoonfuls of cream sauce in the bottom of indi- 
vidual cups or ramekin dishes. Drop into each on top of the 
cream sauce, one raw Qgg; sprinkle with the grated cheese, 
cover with the remaining cream sauce. Stand the dishes in a 
pan of hot water, and bake in a moderate oven five minutes. 
The cream sauce acts as a non-conductor, and if the oven is not 
very hot, bake them eight minutes. Serve at once in the dishes 
in which they are cooked. 



EGGS IN TOMATO SAUCE 

These are made precisely the same as eggs a la Martin, using 
plain tomato sauce, and omitting the cheese. Put the tomato 
sauce in the bottom of the cup ; drop in the egg, and cover it 
with tomato sauce. 



EGGS 263 

JAPANESE EGGS 

I cup of rice i tablespoonful of chopped pars- 

Yi pint of cream sauce ley 

6 eggs A suspicion of onion 

I teaspoonful of soy 
Hard boil the eggs. Carefully boil the rice, drain and turn it 
into the centre of a meat platter, making it into a sort of 
plateau. Remove the shell from the eggs while they are hot ; 
cut them into halves crosswise, press them down into the rice, 
pour over the cream sauce to which you have added the onion 
and soy. Send at once to the table. The dish may be garnished 
with finely chopped parsley or cress. The eggs may be cut into 
slices, one overlapping the other all over the top of the rice, 
and the cream sauce poured over. This dish may be varied by 
using tomato sauce in the place of cream sauce. The edge of 
the dish may also be garnished with broiled sardines, or smoked 
salmon. 

EGG CROQUETTES 

6 eggs I tablespoonful of butter 

Yz pint of milk 2 tablespoonfuls of flour 

I saltspoonful of pepper Yz teaspoonful of salt 

I tablespoonful of chopped parsley 
Hard boil the eggs ; chop them fine. Rub the butter and flour 
together, add to the milk; stir over the fire until thick and 
smooth, add the salt and pepper. Chop the whites of the eggs 
very, very fine, or put them through a vegetable press ; add them 
to the mixture, turn out to cool. When cold, take two table- 
spoonfuls of this mixture in the hand, make it into a sort of 
well ; put the yolk in the centre, and fold the white mixture all 
over. Dip in t^'g and roll in bread crumbs, making a perfect 
ball. Fry in hot fat, and serve with cream sauce.

halves crosswise. Take out the yolks without breaking the 
whites. Put them through a sieve, add the chopped meat, salt, 
pepper and butter melted. Rub and mix thoroughly. Form a 
ball the same size as the yolks, and pack into the spaces from 
which they were taken. Put over the other half of the white. 
Roll in tissue paper that has been fringed at the ends, giving 
it a twist. These are used for picnics and garden parties.

beat until thick and jelly-like ; add the salt and pepper, and 
serve on squares of toasted bread. 

FRENCH OMELET 

Plain French omelet is perhaps one of the most difficult things 
to make ; that is, it is the most difficult to have well made by 
the ordinary cook. Failures come from beating the eggs too 
much, having the butter too hot, and cooking the omelet too 
long before serving time. In large families, where it becomes 
necessary to use a dozen eggs, make two six-egg omelets ; or, 
better, make three four-egg omelets. They are much more 
easily handled. Milk mixed with ^^^ toughens when cooked 
in butter ; hence the use of water. 

Select an omelet pan that is perfectly smooth. Put into it 
a teaspoonful of salt, and with a piece of brown paper rub or 
scour with the salt until the pan is glossy. Put into it a table- 
spoonful of butter ; stand it on the back part of the stove where 
it will melt without browning. Break four eggs into a bowl. 
Give them twelve good, vigorous beats, or just enough to thor- 
oughly mix the whites and yolks; add four tablespoonfuls of 
warm water, a dash of pepper, a tablespoonful of finely chopped 
parsley. Take the salt with the eggs and your spatula to the 



EGGS 255 

fire. Draw the pan over the hottest part of the fire. As soon as 
the butter begins to crackle, turn in the eggs, dust with a half 
teaspoonful of salt ; shake the pan, so that the omelet moves 
backward and forward. Now with your spatula or limber 
knife, lift the omelet at the edge, allowing the thin portion to 
run underneath ; and so continue until the omelet is "set." Have 
ready heated the omelet plate ; fold over one-half the omelet, put 
your spatula across, and turn it out. Garnish with parsley, and 
send at once to the table. 

OMELET WITH PEAS 

Drain, wash, heat and season one can of peas, or one pint of 
freshly shelled peas cooked, seasoned with salt, pepper and 
butter. Make a plain omelet with six eggs. When "set," put 
two tablespoonfuls of peas in the centre ; fold over one half, 
turn it on a heated platter. Pour the remaining quantity of 
the peas around, and send at once to the table. This may be 
varied by pouring over the peas a half pint of cream sauce. 

OMELET WITH OYSTERS 

25 oysters 6 eggs 

1 tablespoonful of butter 5^ cup of milk 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour i teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 
Drain, wash and again drain the oysters ; stir them over the 
fire until the gills curl. Make a half pint of cream sauce from 
the butter and flour and milk ; add the oysters, salt and pepper ; 
stand over hot water while you make a six-egg omelet. Fold 
over the omelet ; turn it on a heated dish, arrange the oysters 
around the edge of the omelet, pour over cream sauce and 
send at once to the table. The juice with the cooked oysters 
should measure a half cup, with the milk you should have a 
half pint of sauce. 

OMELET WITH SWEETBREADS 

This is made precisely the same as omelet with oysters, having 
the sweetbreads parboiled, picked apart and put into cream 



256 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

sauce. Where only one pair of sweetbreads can be procured 
and the family is larger than that amount will supply, a six- 
egg omelet helps you out, and gives variety. 

OMELET WITH TOMATO 

Yi. pint of stewed tomatoes 6 eggs 

I level teaspoonful of salt i saltspoonful of pepper 

I tablespoonful of butter 

The tomatoes may be left in sort of bits. Beat the eggs with- 
out separating until thoroughly mixed ; add the salt, pepper 
and tomato. Put the butter in the omelet pan; when melted, 
turn in the ^%'g mixture ; shake and cook as directed for plain 
omelet. When "set," fold, turn on a heated platter and send 
at once to the table. The tomato takes the place of water. 

SPANISH OMELET 

I onion 6 tablespoonfuls of water 

Yz saltspoonful of salt ^4 pound of bacon 

Cut the bacon into very thin slices ; put it into a frying pan ; add 
a half cup of water ; cook until the water evaporates, then fry 
the bacon carefully. Remove the crackling, add the onion 
chopped fine. Cook on the back part of the stove for fifteen 
minutes. Break the eggs into a bowl ; beat until mixed ; add 
the water, salt and pepper. Draw the pan with the onions, 
over the fire; when hot, turn in the ^%Z'^ shake and lift, 
draining the soft part underneath until the omelet is *'set." 
Fold once, turn into the centre of a heated platter and serve 
immediately. 

OMELETTE SOUFFLE 

Whites of 6 eggs A tablespoonful of lemon juice 

6 tablespoonfuls of powdered Yolks of 3 eggs 

sugar The grated rind of half a lemon 

This is perhaps one of the most difficult of all dishes to make. 
In the first place, it must be made at the very last moment, sent 
from the oven directly to the table. It cannot wait a moment. 
The eggs must be beaten just to the right point. The oven 
must be hot. Everything must be in readiness before begin- 



EGGS 257 

ning. When all this is taken into consideration, an omelette 
souffle is, perhaps, one of the most satisfactory desserts. 

See that the bowl is perfectly clean. Get your pastry bag 
and tube ready, if you are going to use one ; if not, get out the 
baking dish. Divide the sugar ; put three tablespoonf uls into a 
small sieve; separate the eggs carefully, putting three yolks 
into a bowl. Drop the remaining three at once into a cup of 
cold water for future use. Beat the whites of the eggs until 
they are very stiff, but not dry or broken; now add the three 
tablespoonf uls of sugar ; beat for fully ten minutes ; then add 
the well beaten yolks of the three eggs, the grated yellow 
rind of the lemon and last the tablespoon ful of lemon juice. 
Mix carefully and quickly, but thoroughly. Put four or five 
tablespoonfuls in the bottom ^f a silver or common platter ; 
put the remaining portion into your pastry bag, at the end of 
which you have a star tube; press it out in any shape you 
please. You may make rosettes all over the foundation. Dust 
quickly with the remaining three tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar and bake in a quick oven until a golden brown. This 
will take from five to eight minutes. Serve immediately. To 
be perfect, it must be hot but moist under a crisp crust. If 
baked too long, the moment it is touched, it will fall and 
become stringy and unpalatable. This may also be baked in 
paper cases or individual cups; it will then take from four to 
five minutes. 

Omelette souffles are frequently flavored with rum, the rum 
being mixed with the yolk of the egg. Sometimes they axe 
sprayed with sherry just as they are taken from the oven. They 
may be garnished with candied cherries, chopped nuts, and 
made into any form that your fancy suggests, or simply 
heaped into an ordinary baking dish, dusted with sugar, and 
baked. 

BIRDS* NESTS 

Separate the eggs ; beat the whites to a stiff froth ; heap into 
individual baking dishes. Make a nest or well in the centre; 
drop into this the whole yolk. Stand the dish in a pan of water ; 
cover and run the pan into the oven for about two minutes; 



268 MRS. RORER*S NEW COOK BOOK 

dust lightly with salt and pepper. Put a tiny bit of butter in 
the centre, and send at once to the table. This is one of the 
most delicate of all the tgg dishes. 

EGG FLIP 

Separate one egg ; beat the white to a stiff froth ; add the yolk 
and beat again. Heap this on a saucer, dust lightly with pow- 
dered sugar, and sprinkle over a teaspoonful of brandy. The 
egg being raw, porous and light is very easily digested. 



MILK 

Milk is a typical or perfect food. By this, we mean that it 
contains all the necessary elements to sustain life and build and 
repair the tissues of the young of the mammalia. The follow- 
ing table will give the composition of some milks in common 
use (Leffmann) : 

Human Cows' Goats' Mares' 

Fat 3.3 4.0 4.3 I.I 

Sugar (lactose) ... 6.8 4.8 4.0 6.7 

Proteids 1.8 3.5 4.6 1.9 

Ash 0.2 0.7 0.6 0.3 

We must call attention in a very emphatic way to this word 
"food." Milk, being a complete food, is not a beverage, and 
should not be used as such. Many persons complain that they 
cannot take milk and forget this fact, taking it with other nitro- 
genous foods, overpowering their digestion. Milk, however, 
is not intended as a typical food for the adult. It does not 
require mastication, and teeth are given us for this purpose. 

It has been estimated by the chemists of the Agricultural 
Department at Washington that one quart of milk is equal in 
nourishment to three-quarters of a pound of beef. We find, 
however, by experience, that a man can do more work with 
greater ease on the meat than the milk ; he does not become 
hungry so soon. The protein or nitrogenous compounds of 
milk are casein and albumin, and for convenience will be 
referred to hereafter as casein. The carbo-hydrate is lactose or 
milk sugar, represented by the same symbols as cane sugar, 
C19H22O1]. It is, however, not so sweet, and less liable to 
fermentation. The fats are called butter fats, and correspond 
to those found in several vegetable substances. Olive oil, cocoa- 
nut butter, and the oil of the palm tree contain fats of similar 
nature. 

259 



260 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Milk is not easy of digestion unless sipped slowly or masti- 
cated, as it were. When poured down the throat like a glass 
of water it enters the stomach in a mass, is coagulated by the 
ferment, rennin. It is then separated into curds and whey by the 
muscular action or churning of the stomach. It is finally rolled 
into a hard ball, which is difficult of digestion from its very 
density. For this reason it is better to give children a piece of 
hard bread or other food requiring mastication at the same time 
they are eating the milk. The curd of cows' milk is much more 
dense, less friable, than that of human milk. This will explain 
why cows' milk upsets the digestion of infants and even of older 
children. An adult who pours down his throat a glass of cold 
milk during or at the close of the meal has not yet learned to 
respect the power of his digestive apparatus. There are two 
important rules to be remembered in taking milk; one to take 
it slowly and masticate it, the other to take it cool, not iced, 
nor should it be boiled. 

It is a well established fact that milk is an admirable con- 
veyor of diseased germs. It is a nutrient fluid in which they 
thrive, hence it is most important that milk should be collected 
with special care, quickly cooled and kept in conditions of 
extreme cleanliness. If one is living in a neighborhood where 
there is an epidemic of contagious diseases, it is always wise 
to use as little milk as possible, and have that little sterilized. 
This sterilization should be done in a most careful manner, not 
in an open vessel, but in bottles fastened with cotton plugs. 

There is always present in milk a large number of bacteria ; 
most of these are friendly, many aid in the digestion of the milk. 
Milk boiled in an open vessel and put aside to cool may become 
more dangerous than raw milk. The floating bacteria in the 
atmosphere falling into sterilized milk finding no resistance, 
grow rapidly, making the milk exceedingly dangerous. 

Buttermilk is the residue after removing the fatty matter 
from milk by churning. "Separator" milk is the residue after 
the milk has been subjected to centrifugal action. "Separator" 
milk is practically without fat, but contains all the other ele- 
ments of the milk. 

Skimmed milk is the residue after hand skimming; that is, 



MILK 



261 



after the cream has been taken from the top of the milk with an 
ordinary spoon or tin skimmer. This is not an economical way 
of removing fat ; we lose frequently a fifth of the real amount. 
*'Skimmed" milk contains some fat and all the other natural 
constituents of milk.

milk from which most of the water has been evaporated, 
and in some cases cane sugar added. These are not to be 
chosen for infant feeding, imless fresh milk is not to be 
obtained. In the first place they are dead ; are frequently quite 
deficient in fat, a necessary constituent, and if sweetened, are 
doubly bad. According to Church, as much as 40 per cent, of 
cane sugar is frequently used in preservation of canned milk. 

Butter is the fats of milk separated by churning. It forms 
an admirable fatty food if taken on bread or other foods not 
heated. 

Butter differs from many fats, in that it contains a notable 
amount of fats derived from acids, volatile at the point of 
boiling water. Butter, then, is a wholesome fat when fresh 
and sweet, and becomes the cause of serious intestinal trouble 
when heated. Avoid foods covered with melted butter, or 
cooked in butter. 

FERMENTATION OF MILK 

The normal fermentations to which milk is subject are of three 
sorts: First, lactic fermentation, in which the milk becomes 
sour; second, changes in the albuminoids of the milk, putre- 
factive changes, and those in which the fats are attacked by 
butyric fermentation. 

Ropy milk, a condition frequently met with, is due to a fun- 
gus making its appearance during the warm, moist weather of 



262 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

August. It is not known to be injurious, but is exceedingly 
unpleasant. The "red" and "blue" milks are caused by bacteria. 
While there are probably no germs found in clean milk, that 
may be classed as harmful, there are germs not classed among 
the disease producing ones that get into the milk, through care- 
lessness in milking or from unclean vessels or utensils in which 
the milk is kept, that produce poisonous compounds known as 
ptomaines. These frequently occur in stale custard pies, 
cheeses, ice cream, cream puffs and other mixtures of boiled 
milk and eggs. In cheese this is called tyro-toxicon, which 
simply means cheese poison. These ptomaines occur in all 
forms of cooked animal matter; oysters, fish and lobsters are 
particularly susceptible. 

SOURING of milk 

It is supposed that thunder storms have an effect upon the sour- 
ing of milk. Experiments have proven, however, that such is 
not the case; electricity has nothing whatever to do with the 
rapid development of bacteria in the milk. But the conditions 
of the atmosphere preceding such a storm cause unusually rapid 
growth of bacteria. Sterilized milk is not affected by either the 
preceding conditions or the storm itself. To avoid such acci- 
dents, during the warm weather, cool the milk immediately after 
it is drawn from the cow, and keep it cold. Milk should be 
submerged in cold water, stirred until thoroughly cold, and 
kept cold. This milk is not in the slightest affected by thunder 
storms. Try the experiment. From the same dairy, cool one- 
half the milk as soon as it is drawn from the cow, and put in 
cool water or in the ice-house. Allow the other half to cool 
gradually, and then put it into a cold place. The milk allowed 
to cool gradually will sour quickly, especially during the "dog 
day" weather, even when there is no thunder storm, but just 
preceding the storm it will thicken at once. It is not the 
thunder, then, that has brought about the rapid growth of bac- 
teria, but the extreme heat preceding it. In the winter, souring 
may be hastened by adding a tablespoonful of thick, sour milk 
to the fresh milk as soon as it is strained into the pans for 
standing.

MILK 263 

DIGESTIBILITY OF MILK 

Milk is said to be a stomach-digested food. When swallowed 
rapidly and taken in large quantities, it overpowers the diges- 
tion and renders the person very uncomfortable. It is not what 
we eat, but that which we can digest, that is true food. The 
value of food for nutriment depends as much upon how it is 
taken as upon its quality. Milk should be eaten, masticated, 
sipped slowly; then it forms an admirable food for children 
and invalids. 

A third barley water will aid in its digestion and make a 
better food for young children. 

TO SCALD MILK 

Put the milk into the upper part of the double boiler; put it 
into a saucepan and stand it in another of boiling water. As 
soon as the water in the outside boiler reaches again the boiling 
point, the milk is sufficiently heated. Milk never boils in a 
double boiler, but is sufficiently scalded for all practical pur- 
poses. The cooking or heating of milk makes it somewhat more 
difficult of digestion. There are exceptions, however, to the 
rule. The advantage is, that when milk is heated, people will 
sip it from a spoon ; thus it becomes mixed with the saliva, and 
enters the stomach in a more digestible condition. Many per- 
sons can take fresh, warm milk with comfort, but could not pos- 
sibly take it if it was boiled. Scalded milk is always preferable 
to milk that has been boiled. 

TO STERILIZE MILK 

Pour fresh milk into perfectly clean bottles. Stop them with 
cotton plugs. Stand the milk in a sterilizer or steamer, and 
steam continuously for an hour and a half. To make sure that 
the milk is sterile, it may be put aside over night and sterilized 
for one hour the second day. It frequently occurs that the 
adult germs are more easily killed than the spores. Those that 
mature during the night are sure to be killed the next day, and 
thus the milk becomes dead or sterile. Sterilized milk is cer- 
tainly unfit for food for infants, and should not be used except 
in extreme cases of epidemics. If typhoid is in the neighbor- 



264 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

hood, or if you are not quite certain of your milkman, it may 
be wise to sterilize the milk, but should only be resorted to as a 
choice of two evils. 

PASTEURIZED MILK 

Louis Pasteur, a French chemist of the latter part of the last 
century, found that almost all dangerous germs were killed at 
very low temperature ; while more rugged natural germs would 
stand considerable heat. After long, careful and varied experi- 
ments, he found that milk heated to 165° Fahr. was practically 
free from all dangerous bacteria, and still retained a certain 
amount of its own life; hence the term pasteurization, which 
means heating liquid to 165° Fahr. 

Put the milk into bottles ; stop the bottles with cotton plugs ; 
put them into water at the temperature of 155° Fahr. ; increase 
slowly to 165° Fahr., and keep it there for thirty minutes. Be 
very careful that the heat does not go above 165° Fahr. This 
milk will not keep indefinitely, as sterilized milk, but is much 
better for infant feeding. 



KOUMYS 

Pasteurize two quarts of milk. When lukewarm (98° Fahr.), 
add one-third of a compressed yeast-cake dissolved. Boil 
together two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two of water; add 
them to the milk ; stir carefully. Put at once into bottles, cork, 
tying the corks, and stand in a warm place (about 65° Fahr.), 
over night, or for twelve hours. Then turn the bottles carefully 
on their sides in a cold place (about 50° Fahr.) ; let them 
remain twenty-four hours and it is ready to use. These bottles 
must be opened with a champagne tap. Small beer bottles with 
patent corks are convenient as far as the cork is concerned, but 
are most inconvenient to open, as koumys is highly charged 
with carbon dioxid, and the moment the cork is opened, the 
contents of the bottle will shoot to the ceiling. Koumys is more 
digestible than milk ; by the slight fermentation, the formation 
of the gas, the casein or curd is broken up and rendered more 
soluble. It contains a slight percentage of alcohol. 




MILK 2^^ 



LEBAN 



Put into an aluminum kettle tour quarts of milk ; stand it over 
the fire where it will come slowly to the boiling point, and keep 
just below the boiling point for thirty minutes. Take from the 
fire, and when cool (about ioo° Fahr.), add four tablespoonfuls 
of thick sour milk. Lift the skin that has formed over the top 
of the boiled milk at the side; put the spoon down and stir 
under the skin without breaking or tearing it, except in the 
place where it is lifted. Cover the kettle, in fact, wrap it in 
flannel, if possible, and keep it in a warm place (80° Fahr.), 
for five or six hours. At the end of that time, you will have a 
thick milk jelly. This may now be eaten just as it is, or the skin 
removed, and the whole whipped up with an egg beater. It 
may also be put into bottles, corked, and kept on the ice. Leban 
is without gas, and contains but a trace of alcohol. The casein 
is most thoroughly broken up, making it one of the most easily 
digested forms of milk. In fact, it aids in the digestion of other 
food, and is said to be a positive cure for intestinal indigestion. 

FLAVORED MILK 

In certain cases of sickness, where it becomes necessary to use 
milk as a continuous diet, it frequently is necessary to remove 
the odor or flavor of the milk. This is easily done by pasteur- 
izing it with raisins, or a stick of cinnamon. If the milk is to 
be taken warm, the raisins or cinnamon may be put into a 
double boiler, with the milk, heated and used at once. 

JUNKET 

1 quart of milk I junket tablet 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar ^ teaspoonful of flavoring 

[eat the milk to 100 ** Fahr. ; add the sugar and flavoring, then 
the junket tablet dissolved in about two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Mix quickly and turn at once into the serving dish. Stand the 
dish in a warm place in any part of the kitchen until thoroughly 
congealed, about twenty minutes. Then stand in a cold place 



266 MRS. 

until serving time. In moving this, great care must be taken 
not to shake or tear the jelly from the side of the dish, or whey 
will form at once, leaving the curd unsightly and indigestible. 
This may be served plain, or with cream. Sterilized, condensed, 
or evaporated milk will not congeal with rennet. They are 
dead, as it were ; rennin acts only with living milk. If the milk, 
as soon as the junket is added, is placed in the refrigerator, it 
will not form a jelly. You have reduced it below the point nec- 
essary for digestion; and this congealing is but the first step 
toward the digestion of the milk. 

Junket may be flavored with lemon, coffee, chocolate or 
caramel. 

MODIFIED OR HUMANIZED COWS' MILK 

Cows' milk, even when diluted or partly modified, frequently 
disagrees with an infant. The following recipe may be used 
with good results. Be sure that the milk is of the very best 
quality, and is perfectly clean ; that is, as clean as milk can be. 
Put two quarts of milk into a sterilized or scalded basin. Stand 
it in a cool place for two hours ; then with a rubber tube, used 
as a siphon, siphon into another basin the lower or under quart 
of the milk, leaving the cream or top milk in the first 
basin. Heat the under milk to ioo° Fahr. (a little more than 
blood heat), add to it^ne junket tablet, dissolved in two table- 
spoonfuls of warm water. Let it stand for a moment until con- 
gealed, then break it slightly with a fork and strain it through 
a cheese cloth. Add this whey to the first, top milk ; add two 
teaspoonfuls of sugar of milk, and a half pint of water. 

MODIFIED OR HUMANIZED COWS' MILK, NO. 2 

In cases of rickets, where a large amount of muscle and bone 
making food is indicated, it has been found desirable to add to 
the infant's food the white of egg. This recipe has been used for 
many years by myself, and I have found but few cases where it 
was objectionable. Heat one quart of milk to 100° Fahr. ; add 
one junket tablet, dissolved in one tablespoon ful of cold water. 




MILK 



267 



Stir for a moment. When the milk is congealed and solid, 
break it with a fork. Strain it through two thicknesses of cheese 
cloth, rejecting all the curd. Put the whey at once on the ice 
to cool. Add a half ounce of sugar of milk, three ounces of 
cream, and one ounce of white of egg. The white may be 
dropped into a fruit jar, a pint of whey added, and the whole 
shaken together, and then turned into the mass. This is also 
a valuable food for convalescing invalids. The cream and 
sugar of milk may be omitted in cases of typhoid. 

MODIFIED OR HUMANIZED COWS' MILK, No. 3 

For a very young infant, mix one ounce of cream with four 
ounces of milk, a teaspoonful of lime water, a level teaspoonful 
of milk sugar, and nine ounces of hot water. Use at each feed- 
ing one ounce of this mixture for the first week, feeding every 
two hours from five a. m. to midnight or one o'clock. 

CREAM 

TO WHIP CREAM 

The cream must be at least twenty-four hours old; better, 
thirty-six, and must be very, very cold. As soon as the cream is 
taken from the milk, or as soon as it is delivered to your house 
by the milkman, pack it in cracked ice and let it stand until very 
cold. 

The best churn is a small, tin vessel with a dasher made of 
wire. Turn the cream into this churn, which must be perfectly 
cold ; stir rapidly for about three minutes and the cream will be 
whipped to the very bottom. The faster the motion, the quicker 
the cream will be whipped. Without a churn, turn the cream 
into an ordinary bowl ; stand it in a pan of cracked ice or ice 
water, and beat it with an egg beater or a fork, or wire spoon, 
until the whole mass is perfectly thick. At first, it is wise to 
skim off a portion of the froth from the surface and rest it on 
the sieve. A small syllabub churn may be placed in the cream, 
and by rapidly manipulating the dasher, the whole mass may be 
whipped in a short time. It is necessary here to skim off the 



268 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

froth as fast as it forms on the top. The reason why the cream 
so often ''goes to butter" is that it is too warm, too thick or too 
new. It must be sufficiently thick to hold the air, but not but- 
tery. 

DEVONSHIRE CREAM 

Put four quarts of milk into a basin ; stand it aside over 
night. Next morning stand it on the back part of the stove 
where it will come slowly to almost boiling point. Stand it in a 
cold place; then remove the cream carefully from the surface, 
and put it at once into a cold place. This may be used just as 
it is, in the place of butter. 

BUTTER. 

BUTTER MAKING 

Among the ordinary farmers, it has been the fashion for years 
to make butter from sour cream, the cream taken from the 
surface of thick, sour milk, put into a stone jar, stirred every day 
as more cream is added, the churning done but once or twice a 
week. But it is everywhere recog^zed to-day that the so-called 
ripening of cream is simply an increased growth of bacteria. In 
fact, so much depends upon the number and the special variety 
of the bacteria, that we now have them separated and for sale, so 
that the farmer may ripen his cream in a few minutes by adding 
the proper species. If the cream stands too long, and the place 
in which it is kept is not thoroughly clean or is contaminated 
with vegetables, as is the case in many country cellars, the but- 
ter is bitter, and is not good. The fact is that the cream should 
not stand more than three days, should be closely covered, 
stirred each day, and kept in a place free from dangerous con- 
taminations. In many of the creameries sweet cream is used in 
preference to sour. The cream is separated from the milk by 
means of a "separator" and churned at once into butter. Such 
butter is sweet and delicious, but must be used at once or it will 
assume a sour or stale taste other than that which would have 
been imparted to the cream had it been allowed to stand before 
churning. The noted butter makers churn every day, and take 



MILK 



269 



back and use over the butter that has been standing in the open 
market more than two days. Butter is exceedingly susceptible 
to flavors, and must be kept in a place free from contamination. 
In winter at the ordinary farmhouse, where cream is cold, scald 
the churn ; let it stand for a moment, turn out the hot water, 
and turn in the cream. The heat of the churn will be sufficient 
to bring the cream to a temperature of 65° Fahr., a good tem- 
perature for churning. After the butter has been churned, turn 
the dasher backwards and forwards for a few moments to "col- 
lect" it. Take it out ; stand it for a moment in a very cold place. 
Do not wash the butter, as in this way it is robbed of elements 
necessary for its flavor and preservation. Begin now to work it, 
and work continuously and thoroughly until every particle of 
buttermilk is drained out. This is best done on a slanting board. 
You may use a corrugated roller or an ordinary paddle. It is 
the fashion to add salt, although it is much better unsalted. 
Allow one tablespoonful to each pound of butter. After this, 
work it for five minutes; make at once into prints, and stand 
away in a cold place. 

To wash soft butter, after it has been thoroughly collected 
in the churn, draw off the buttermilk and add water at the 
temperature of 50° Fahr. about one-half the amount of butter- 
milk withdrawn. Agitate the butter and water for just a 
moment ; withdraw the water, and again cover the butter with 
water a little colder than the first. Agitate it again; this time 
the water will be perfectly clear and not milky. The texture of 
the butter is greatly affected by the temperature of the water. If 
on a warm day, the butter "comes" soft, the housewife too fre- 
quently cools it down by pouring over large quantities of ice or 
cold water, or throwing a large piece of ice into the churn. It is 
true, the butter quickly hardens under such a change, but is 
greatly affected by after temperatures. It is better to increase 
the coolness of the water in the washings, using the milder tem- 
perature at first. If by any accident the churn has been too 
warm, so that the butter comes in a soft condition, add a third 
fiuantity of water still a little colder than the second. 

TO COLOR BUTTER 

To color butter, add while working a few drops of annatto.

Cheese is the curd of milk separated and pressed. This sepa- 
ration is brought about by two methods. In the country 
farmhouse schmierkase, or cottage cheese, is made from sour 
milk. The milk is allowed to stand until a thick bcfliny-clabber 
is formed. It is then slightly heated, which separates the curd 
from the whey. The curd is then strained out, mixed with but- 
ter and made into balls or with cream into a soft cheese, 
schmierkase. Such a cheese is rather more easily digested than 
the ordinary sweet curd cheeses, common store cheese, made 
from sweet milk, the curd separated by the action of rennet ; 
then strained and pressed. Such cheese is sweet and palatable, 
but dense and difficult of digestion ; should not be eaten unless 
in very small quantities, with a dinner salad with French dress- 
ing, or cooked and mixed with other food. 

Ripe or old cheese as Camembert, Gorgonzola, Roquefort 
and Brie, are sweet curd cheeses, put aside until "ripe." The 
ripening is usually due to bacteria, in the Roquefort to a fungus. 
These are said to be more easy of digestion than the new sweet 
cheeses, as Neufchatel or cream cheese, and in small quantities 
aid in the digestion of other food. The casein of these cheeses 
is no longer in the same condition as in milk. During the pro- 
cess of ripening it has undergone decomposition, and new com- 
pounds are formed. 

The rich after-dinner cheeses are Roquefort, Camembert, 
Stilton, Brie, Gorgonzola, Schweitzer and Limburger. The 
medium rich, with keeping qualities, are Pineapple, Edam. and 
English Dairy. These are also served with the salad course, 



MILK 271 

or with coffee and crackers at the close of dinner. Parmesan, 
a skimmed milk cheese, with fine keeping qualities, and sap- 
sago, are grated and served with macaroni and other Italian 
pastes. 

CHEESE COOKERY 

It is not our mission here to deal with the making or keeping of 
cheese. The various state experimental stations, as well as the 
Agricultural Department of the Government, have put out from 
time to time carefully written bulletins upon these subjects. 
Here we will deal simply with cheese cookery, which is perhaps 
the most important part of its treatment, as it governs its digest- 
ibility; consequently its food value. Cheese is a nitrogenous 
or proteid matter ; hence, it is a muscle or tissue building food, 
and is digested in the stomach. It is concentrated ; hence, must 
be taken in small quantities and diluted, as it were, with car- 
bonaceous foods, as bread, or rice. 

Among country people, new cheese is frequently eaten raw. 
By this we do not mean sour milk cheese, but cheese made from 
sweet milk and under such circumstances, it is most difficult of 
digestion. Being dense, even when thoroughly masticated, it is 
not easily soluble. Ripe or old cheese aids in the digestion of 
other foods, simply because it is rich in bacteria. It is an old 
saying that — 

** Ripe cheese is a crusty old elf, 
Digesting everything but itself." 

This, however, is not exactly true, as old or ripe cheese has 
passed the primary stage of digestion. 

COTTAGE CHEESE OR SCHMIERKASE 

Pour four quarts of boiling water into four quarts of thick, sour 
milk ; let it stand for a moment ; turn into a drain bag and hang 
aside over night. When ready to serve, beat well, season with 
salt and pepper, add cream and serve as a spoon cheese, or make 
into 

CHEESE BALLS 

To each pint of drained curd, add two ounces of melted but- 
ter, a level teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and 



272 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



two tablespoonfuls of thick cream. Work this until smooth 
and soft ; make into balls the size of a tennis ball. This will take 
the place of cream or Neufchatel cheese, and may be served 
with the salad course. 



PARMESAN BALLS 

These balls must be used the same day on which they are made, 
and are passed with the lettuce course at dinner. Put a half 
pint of the drained curd into a bowl ; rub it with the back of a 
spoon until perfectly smooth ; add two tablespoonfuls of grated 
parmesan, and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a saltspoon- 
ful of salt, a dash of red pepper, and, if you have it, just a drop 
of green coloring. Mix well and roll into balls the size of an 
English walnut. Heap after the fashion of cannon balls, and 
stand away until very cold. 



WELSH RAREBIT 

Like every other cook, my own recipe for Welsh rarebit exceeds 
all others in quality. There is not a dish in the whole list that 
has so many methods of making, all more or less alike, but the 
simple change of seasoning gives different results. 

To each pound of soft American cheese allow a teaspoonful 
of Worcestershire sauce, six tablespoonfuls of musty ale or 
beer, a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper, a saltspoonful 
of white pepper, a teaspoonful of horseradish, one clove of gar- 
lic. Chop or grate the cheese. Rub the pan or chafing dish 
with the garlic. Mix all the seasoning with the cheese. Put the 
ale or beer into the saucepan ; as soon as it is hot and boiling, 
throw in the cheese and stir constantly and continuously until 
smooth and creamy. Toward the last, beat rapidly. Turn it on 
to a very hot platter that has been nicely covered with toasted 
bread. Serve at once. The yolks of two eggs may be added to 
the cheese before heating,

The American people, as a class, in their rushing and bustling 
life, prefer to take their nitrogen from animal products, which 
are rather more easily digested and assimilated than vegetables. 
It is a fact, however, that all the elements necessary for the 
building of the body are found in the vegetable world. Our 
working animals, " beasts of burden," build and repair large 
bodies, under heavy labor, on materials from the vegetable 
kingdom. True, their digestive apparatus is rather different 
from man's, and is better suited to the dry, concentrated 
cereals. We do not, however, get from the animal a single 
element except that which the animal has taken from the 
vegetable world. His flesh is the result of the digestion of 
vegetable materials. Flesh is living tissue, the partly digested 
food, hence, more easily digested by man than vegetables at 
first hand. Meat is rich in water, containing less nitrogen 
than peas, beans and lentils, but in a more acceptable form 
to American and English business men or teachers who spend 
most of their lives in close, ill-ventilated rooms. There are 
many sides to the vegetarian question worthy of considera- 
tion. Our so-called food specialists are usually meat-eating 
men. Experiments with vegetable food are limited to a 
narrow range. I have not yet seen a single list containing 
nuts, cereals, fruits, nitrogenous, succulent and starchy vege- 
tables as a general diet. The true vegetarian uses all forms 
of vegetable foods ; he does not try to live upon potatoes and 
so-called green or succulent vegetables. These do not contain 
nitrogen, and are insufficient to sustain life. Nuts well pre- 
pared and mixed with cereals, and such easily digested foods 
as rice give sustaining power not attainable by meat. Health 
and nutrition depend entirely upon the class of vegetables 
selected. The Japanese, who do in their country the work 
performed by horses here, are practically vegetarians. 

It is stated quite dogmatically that vegetables are less 

277 



278 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

completely digested than meats. Such decisions are made 
after incomplete and short experiments, and cannot be sub- 
stantiated. 

Meat carefully cooked is more easily digested than some 
vegetables ; but vegetables are clean and wholesome. Nitro- 
genous vegetables are slow of digestion ; hence, the vegetarian 
requires but two meals per day; but in those two meals, espe- 
cially if his diet is well selected, he will receive more nourish- 
ment than from three meals of meat. Two points have been 
gained, time spent in eating and money saved. Then, too, 
he has had much greater variety. The vegetarian is not com- 
pelled to eat steaks, chops and roasted beef to be followed 
by roasts of beef, steaks and chops; but selects from a score 
of dishes made by blending different vegetables, nuts and 
fruits. Vegetable foods are not to any great extent digested 
in the stomach, with the exception of the leguminous seeds, 
which are rich in proteids. Vegetable foods call forth greater 
mechanical effort on the part of the stomach than meats. If 
a person has indigestion, meats are to be preferred. The 
amount of cellulose or waste in vegetable foods keeps up 
the peristaltic motion of the intestines and lower bowels ; hence, 
vegetable eaters are very rarely troubled with constipation and 
torpid livers. Skin diseases are frequently due to a lack of 
green vegetables. 

An observer can readily understand, however, why we 
have grown into a meat-eating nation. A short visit into the 
house of a neighbor makes this point quite plain. The so- 
called cook, an uneducated woman who is perhaps a second- 
rate scullery maid, presides over the kitchen. She does not 
know the chemical composition of a single article she cooks, 
nor the effect of heat upon them. She does know how to 
cook meats ; they can be broiled or roasted. These two methods 
form the limit of her horizon. Broiling intensifies the flavor 
of a steak, and with a little seasoning of salt and pepper, and 
a bunch of parsley, makes a palatable and sightly dish. The 
cook has given it little care and less thought. Not so with 
vegetables ; they owe their flavor to volatile oils which are 
easily dissipated by careless or rapid cooking. Badly cooked 



VEGETABLES 279 

vegetables are tasteless ; all the flavor has been cooked out and 
poured down the drain. Potatoes, a common vegetable, served 
ifi nearly every household once or twice a day, are seldom 
well cooked, palatable or sightly. Rice is almost unfit for 
food; in nine cases out of ten it is yellow, not white, heavy 
and sodden, a mass of wet starch. Few things show the dif- 
ference between comfortable and slovenly housekeeping more 
quickly than the dressing of vegetables. 

V^egetables are divided into four classes : Those rich in 
nitrogen, muscle and tissue building foods ; those containing 
carbo-hydrates, starch and sugar; fatty vegetables, nuts and 
olives ; and the vegetables containing water and mineral matter. 
In the first class we have peas, beans and lentils, and the chick 
pea of the East. Nitrogen is also found in goodly quantities 
in the cereals and nuts and glutin macaroni. In the second 
class, carbo-hydrates, we have rice, white bread, potatoes, the 
ordinary macaroni. Those containing mineral matter and 
water are the so-called succulent vegetables, as cabbage, car- 
rots, turnips, spinach, cress, lettuce and tomatoes. The nitrog- 
enous principles of vegetables are acted upon in the stomach 
the same as those of meat; the carbo-hydrates in the mouth 
and the small intestines ; fats are emulsionized by the secre- 
tions from the pancreas and gall. There is no difference 
between meats and vegetables in the place or method of diges- 
tion. The effects upon the body, the time consumed, and the 
mechanical efforts of the body are, no doubt, radically different. 

Vegetables, as a rule, should be cooked in uncovered ves- 
sels, covering does not keep in the flavor. Rapid boiling ren- 
ders underground vegetables, as parsnips, carrots and turnips, 
tough. Cook them in water at 210° Fahr. ; this softens the 
fibre and quickly renders them tender, and at the same time, 
they retain their flavor and color. Rapid boiling dissipates the 
flavor and spoils the color. Rice and macaroni should be boiled 
rapidly, not that the water is hotter, but the motion of rapidly 
boiling water washes apart and separates the particles. Both 
contain starch ; if allowed to simmer or cooked in a double boiler, 
they become soft, sticky, water-soaked and soggy. Potatoes must 
be cooked at the boiling point ; this does not mean at a gallop. 



280 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

All vegetables go over the fire in boiling water — this does not 
mean lukewarm or water that has been boiled, but water that is 
boiling. To green vegetables add a teaspoonful of salt to each 
half gallon of water in which they are to be boiled. Under- 
ground vegetables, as the roots and tubers of plants, are best 
cooked in unsalted water. These are rich in woody fibre; the 
fibre is toughened by the hardened water. For instance, turnips 
are white, sweet and palatable, dainty and delicious vegetables, 
if cut into blocks and cooked carefully in unsalted water. Boil 
the same kind of turnips rapidly in salt water and notice the dif- 
ference — the first are white and sweet, the second, pink, coarse 
and unpalatable. It is a well known fact that all vegetables 
containing casein, as split peas, lentils, old peas and beans, 
are not softened in hard water. The salts of lime coagulate 
the casein and render it dense and difficult of digestion. Add 
a saltspoonful of bi-carbonate of soda to each half gallon of 
water in which they are boiled. This will soften the water and 
make vegetables tender. Do not add soda, however, to green 
vegetables. Onions, if carefully cooked in salted water, arc 
delicious ; they lose their sweetness and aroma when boiled 
in unsalted water. 

If green vegetables become wilted from keeping or dryness, 
put them in clear, cold water ; do not under any circumstances 
add salt to the water; it draws out the juices and hardens the 
fibre. For example, cucumbers soaked five minutes in salted 
water are tough, will never regain their crispness, and are 
poisonous to a delicate stomach. Simple methods of cooking 
all vegetables are to be preferred. Carefully boiled or baked, 
and served with delicate sauces they are most attractive. 

It is said that all vegetables not contain-ing starch are best 
and more wholesome served raw. The roots, as turnips, car- 
rots and beets, must, however, be grated or scraped. The dense 
fibre renders them difficult of mastication and digestion. 

To freshen wilted vegetables, soak them before cooking in 
clear, cold, unsalted water. 

For the convenience of persons who are on a restricted 
diet, the vegetables have been arranged in groups, that their 
chemical composition may be seen at a glance.

This group contains all vegetables common to the United 
States, in which starch is the principal nutrient, and the 
cereals, chestnuts, and manufactured foods, as macaroni, etc., 
served as vegetables. 

Starchy vegetables belonging to the carbo-hydrates are fat 
formers, and heat and energy producers. 

They are digested in the mouth and small intestines ; unless 
well masticated in the small intestine only. 

POTATOES (Solanum tuberosum, Linnaeus) 

The portion of the plant used as food constitutes the tuber, an 
enlarged, or gorged, underground stem — the store-house for 
nourishment for the young plants. 

Many varieties, quite dissimilar in composition and general 
appearance, are grown in different parts of the world. Those 
grown in South America are of a rich yellow color when 
cooked, and much more dry and mealy than those grown in 
the United States. The German potatoes, imported for salads, 
are small, slightly yellow, dry and sweet. These are sold at 
ten cents per quart at the German delicatessen in all large 
cities. They are much better for salad than the American 
varieties. 

Potatoes should be kept for winter use in a cool, dry, dark 
place. Warmth, light and moisture cause growth and loss of 
nutrition, while they increase the quantity of solanin, a poison- 
ous substance found in all potatoes. This substance is in greater 
quantity in very young and old potatoes. Those ripe, or full 
grown, contain least, but in all cases it is dissipated or driven 
off in the cooking. Water in which potatoes have been boiled 
is unsafe for food; it should be thrown away. In making 



2S4 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

potato soup, par-boil the potatoes for five minutes and throw 
away the water. The water of the second boiHng- is usually 
free from solanin and quite safe. Pare sparingly, as both nour- 
ishment and mineral matter are greater near the skin. Observe 
a cross section of a good full-grown potato; first comes the 
skin, then the Hhro-vascular bundles, a narrow white layer, 
rich in starch and mineral matter, then the fleshy portion, in 
the centre of which is a watery core. The Hbro-vascular layer 
contains nearly as much nourishment as the remaining portion 
of the potato. 

As the flavor of potatoes is due to the mineral matter, which 
is in greater quantity near the skin, they are more tasty when 
boiled in their jackets. 

Carefully cooked they constitute a wholesome and easily 
digested starchy food. The amount of nitrogen is small, and 
does not belong to the flesh forming proteids. Potatoes can- 
not be depended upon as a complete food, but should be served 
with such nitrogenous foods as nuts, peas, beans, lentils, or 
lean meats. The food value and digestibility, however, depend 
entirely on the method of cooking. Baked, or boiled, mealy, 
not heavy, they are rather more easily digested than white 
bread or hominy ; when fried or mashed and patted down with 
butter, served in a covered dish, they are less digestible. When 
fried, covered with grease, the primary digestion, which is in 
the mouth, is lost, as each grain of starch is surrounded by fat. 
The saliva cannot penetrate the fat in the usual time given to 
mastication, which leaves the entire digestion to the intestines ; 
the stomach has little or no action on potatoes.

the skin, hence, the potato withers, and the nutrition is lost. 
Old potatoes should be pared and soaked in cold water at least 
thirty minutes before cooking. Full grown potatoes do not 
require soaking. 

Potatoes belong to the carbo-hydrates, fat and energy pro- 
ducers, and are digested principally in the small intestine. 

TO BOIL POTATOES 

Pare the potatoes, remove the eyes, and throw them at once 
into cold water. Put them into a kettle of boiling unsalted 
water; boil rapidly for ten minutes, and then cook at the boil- 
ing point until the potatoes are nearly done ; add a cup of cold 
water, this will cool the surface, allowing the centre to cook a 
moment longer and making the potato mealy to the very centre. 
As soon as the water again reaches the boiling point drain the 
potatoes perfectly dry; dust them with salt and shake the pot 
lightly over the fire. When they are dry and white, like snow 
balls, turn them in a hot uncovered dish and send at once to 
the table. If a "peeling" has not been taken off around the 
potato, the skin will burst — a well cooked potato is too big 
for its clothes. Scrape, do not pare new potatoes. 

BAKED POTATOES 

Brush the potatoes until the skin is perfectly clean, rinse them 
in cold water. Place them in a pan or on the grate in a moder- 
ately heated oven ; bake slowly until tender, about three- 
quarters of an hour. When done take each potato in a towel 
or napkin in the hand, press it gently without breaking the 
skin until it is thoroughly mashed within. Never stick a fork 
in a potato to see if it is done; this ruptures the skin, allows 
the steam to escape, and makes the potato soggy. If the oven is 
too hot, the skins will become hardened and prevent the evapora- 
tion of water ; this also makes potatoes heavy, dark and wet. 

If baked potatoes are mashed according to directions, in the 
skin, they will keep in good condition, in a warm oven, one 
hour. To serve, place them on a folded napkin and send to 
the table, uncovered.

STUFFED POTATOES 

This is one of the best ways of using up cold baked potatoes ; 
potatoes *' left over " may be cut into halves while warm, the 
centres scooped out, seasoned with salt and pepper, then beaten 
until light ; fill the " shells," and put aside to be browned, at 
serving time. The well beaten white of an egg may be stirred 
in, if desired ; but as potatoes are served as an accompaniment 
to meat, this is unnecessary. Serve stuffed potatoes with 
broiled or panned chicken. 

DELMONICO POTATOES 

4 good-sized cold boiled pota- ^ teaspoonful of salt 

toes 4 tablespoonfuls of chopped or 

I tablespoonful of butter grated cheese

Chop the potatoes rather fine. Rub the butter and flour 
together, add the milk, and when boiling, add the salt and 
pepper. Mix with this the potatoes, turn into a baking dish, 
sprinkle the cheese over the top; press it down in the cream 
sauce and bake in a quick oven until a golden brown, about 
ten minutes.. Serve with chops, or beefsteak. 

HASHED BROWNED POTATOES 

Chop two cold potatoes rather fine ; add a half teaspoonful of 
salt, a half saltspoonful of pepper and four tablespoonfuls of 
cream. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a saute or omelet pan ; 
melt without browning ; when hot put in the potatoes ; smooth 
down, pressing them neatly into shape; cook for a moment 
over a quick fire, and then push to the back part of the stove 
where they will cook slowly for ten minutes. Watch carefully 
that they do not scorch. Then fold over one-half as you would 
an omelet, pressing them lightly ; turn out on a heated platter, 
garnish with parsley and send to the table. Serve with beef- 
Steak.

ball ; throw these into cold water. When ready to use, put 
them in boiling water, boil for ten minutes, drain, dust with 
salt, and turn in a heated dish. Garnish with carefully melted 
butter and finely chopped parsley, or they may be boiled five 
minutes, drained, plunged in hot fat until nicely browned. 
These are served as a garnish or accompaniment to boiled fish. 

POTATO TIMBALE

fectly smooth, and press through a sieve. Line the bottoms 
of small timbale molds with greased paper; fill them with the 
potato mixture, stand in a baking-pan of boiling water, and 
cook in the oven twenty minutes. When done, loosen the sides 
with a thin knife and turn them out carefully on a heated dish. 
These are much more delicate than potato croquettes, and one 
gets rid of frying. The dish may be garnished with nicely 
cooked peas, and the two served as an accompaniment to 
spring lamb, or lamb chops.

with white of egg, and brown in a quick oven. Lift carefully 
to a serving dish, fill the centre with a fricassee of chicken or 
rabbit, or a carefully made ragout of beef or mutton. A simple, 
easy way is to make the border on a platter or serving dish, 
and brown it in the oven before filling. 

POTATO a la ANNA 

6 good-sized potatoes, chopped 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 
fine 3^ teaspoonful of salt 

Pare the potatoes, throw them into cold water; take from the 
water, and chop them quickly or they will discolor. Put a layer 
in the bottom of the baking-dish, then sprinkle with salt, then 
a layer of potato, another sprinkling of salt until the dish is 
filled. Melt the butter over hot water, and drain it carefully 
over the potatoes, leaving the sediment of the butter in the dish. 
Cover, stand it in a pan of hot water, and bake in a moderate 
oven about three-quarters of an hour. When the potatoes are 
half done, stir them carefully ; remove the cover, also the water 
pan and finish in a rather quick oven. Dust the top with 
chopped parsley and onion juice, and send at once to the table. 
Serve with steak. 

BROWNED BAKED POTATOES 

Peel as many potatoes as are needed for the family, put them 
into a baking-dish ; baste each carefully with stock or glaze ; 
use at least half a pint of stock to eight potatoes. Bake in a 
quick oven basting frequently. While the crust or outside of 
these potatoes is rather difficult of digestion, the inside is mealy 
and delicate. 

POTATOES a la BORDELAISE 

Select small new potatoes of uniform size; scrape and throw 
them at once into cold water; put them into boiling water; 
boil rapidly for ten minutes, drain and dust with salt. While

these are cooking, rub together a tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour; add half a pint of stock, a tablespoonful of 
chopped onion, a bay leaf, and, if you have them, half a can 
of finely chopped mushrooms, or two fresh mushrooms ; bring 
to boiling point, add a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, and the 
potatoes. Cover and stand on the back part of the stove for 
ten minutes. This amount of sauce will be sufficient for a pint 
of potatoes. 

Serve with pot roast, or boiled beef, or braised mutton. 



POTATOES a la CREME 

4 cold boiled potatoes % nutmeg, grated 

y^, cup of cream i level teaspoonful of salt

Chop the potatoes rather fine, and add to them all the ingre- 
dients. Put them into small individual molds, and bake in 
a quick oven fifteen minutes. Send at once to the table. Serve 
with chops or broiled chicken. 



FRIED POTATOES 

I have not made this heading, approving of fried potatoes, but 
to say a word against them. There are so many delicious ways 
in which potatoes may be cooked, and in which they are easily 
digested, that it seems a pity to destroy their food value by 
dropping them in hot fat. Cold boiled potatoes are unfit 
for frying. The starch cells are already ruptured, and if the 
second cooking is done in hot fat, they become hard, horny, 
unwholesome and indigestible. 

If potatoes are to be fried at all, let them be plunged, raw, 
into hot fat at about 300° Fahr. Cut into blocks, into quar- 
ters, or " shoe strings," or into thin slices as Saratoga chips. 
They are indigestible in this way, but less so than those boiled 
and then fried. Potatoes cut into fancy shapes, plunged into 
hot fat until brown are used as a garnish to broiled steaks, and 
fish.

RICE {Oryza sativa, Linn.) 

Rice belongs to the great grass order, the group of cereals. 
It is exceedingly rich in starch, and contains a small amount 
of proteid, fat, and mineral matter. It is said, however, that 
varieties of the East Indian rice contain more nitrogenous con- 
stituents than the rice grown in America. In boiling, rice parts 
with a goodly quantity of both starch and mineral matter, 
hence, the necessity of steaming it in small quantities of water, 
East Indian fashion, or saving the water in which it is boiled 
for soups. 

Rice is highly valuable as a starchy food, containing four 
times as much nourishment as potatoes, and requires only one 
hour for perfect digestion. It is readily absorbed and leaves 
little or no waste in the intestines. From both a money and 
nutritive standpoint it is the most desirable starchy food to 
serve with nitrogenous materials, as meats, eggs and milk. It 
forms the staple food for three-fourths of the world's inhabi- 
tants.

TO BOIL RICE 

Rice served as a vegetable should be simply and quickly cooked 
in unsalted water. Wash a half pint of good rice through 
several cold waters. Have ready a large kettle partly filled 
with rapidly boiling water. Sprinkle in the rice slowly so as 
not to stop the boiling. Boil rapidly in an uncovered vessel 
for thirty minutes. By this time a portion of the water will 
have been absorbed. Drain the rice in a colander, pour through 
it quickly a quart of cold water, stand the colander in a plate, 
and then at the oven door where the heat will pass through the 
rice ; now and then toss it with a f our-tined wooden fork from 
the side of the colander to the middle and back again, being 
very careful not to break the grains. Turn it at once into a 
shallow dish and send to the table. Rice is well cooked when 
each grain has swollen four times its original size, no two are 
sticking together, and is as white as snow. 

Serve plain boiled rice with mutton or lamb and poultry 
of all kinds. In most foreign countries, it is also served with 
veal. 

BOILED RICE, EAST INDIA FASHION 

Wash a half pint of rice through several cold waters ; drain, 
and allow it to stand for two hours. Put over the fire a quart

rapidly, sprinkle in the rice and continue the rapid cooking, 
tossing the rice with a wooden fork almost constantly for ten 
minutes. Then push the kettle to the back of the stove where 
it will steam without danger of scorching; toss every few min- 
utes. The water will be absorbed quickly, but the rice will 
continue to steam until cooked and dry. Do not cover the 
kettle or the rice will be heavy. The very moment that it is 
done, turn it in a heated dish and send to the table. 

This method requires very much more care and knowledge 
than the preceding one. Under no circumstances can you cook 
rice to serve as a vegetable in a double boiler ; it may, however, 
be steamed in a "cooker." Materials cooked in a double boiler 
are neither steamed nor boiled. 

Patna rice requires but twenty minutes* cooking. 

American or Carolina rice from twenty-five to thirty min- 
utes. 

CORN (ZeaMays) 

HOMINY 

Of this we have two sorts, one almost the entire grain with the 
hull taken off, the other the grain ground after the hull has been 
removed ; the latter is known as hominy grits. This is fre- 
quently served as a breakfast food, but may be served as a 
vegetable in place of potatoes or rice at dinner or supper. It 
is more easily digested boiled in water than milk. Both kinds 
of hominy should be soaked in cold water over night, then 
cooked slowly for a long while. According to Payne the fol- 
lowing is the correct analysis of these dried materials:

absorbed add fresh boiling water. Cook slowly for at least four 
hours, better five. Allow to each pint of the dry material one 
teaspoonful of salt added after the hominy is tender. When 
done it should be free from water; that is, it should have 
absorbed all the water. Add to it a palatable seasoning of 
butter and milk, and send at once to the table. 

TO BOIL GRITS 

Wash a half pint of grits through several cold waters; add 
one quart of cold water and soak over night, or for several 
hours. Then bring slowly to boiling point, and cook in a 
double boiler for at least one hour, better two. 

To serve as a vegetable add a teaspoonful of salt, four table- 
spoonfuls of thick cream, and a saltspoonful of pepper. 

GRITS BLOCKS 

Cut cold boiled hominy grits into blocks. Dip them in beaten 
egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat. Serve with brown 
fricassee of chicken, rabbit and hare or game. 

GRITS SLICES 

Mold well cooked hominy in a square bread pan. When solid 
turn out, cut into slices a half inch thick, dip each slice in beaten 
egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat. Serve in place of 
toast under baked or broiled birds. 

HOMINY CROQUETTES 

Wash a half pint of hominy through several cold waters ; add 
a quart of milk and cook in a double boiler three hours. Add 
a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, ten drops of 
onion juice, and the yolks of two eggs. Mix thoroughly and 
turn out to cool. When cold form into cylinder-shaped cro- 
quettes. Dip in egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat. 
Serve with white or brown fricassee of chicken, or with game. 
For supper or lunch these may be served with tomato or 
cheese sauce and will then take the place of meat.

TARO 

(Colocasia antiquorum, Schott, Variety esculenta) 
Root of the Elephant Ear 

The Sandwich Islanders make the famous poi by boiling and 
baking the taro root, beating it until light and allowing it to fer- 
ment for two or three days. Recipes for cooking will be found 
in the group of Hawaiian dishes. 

CASSAVA AND TAPIOCA 

Both of these preparations are very rich in starch, containing 
from 83 to 85%. They are made from the fleshy roots of two 
species of the tropical genus Manihot, one being the sweet and 
the other bitter. The latter, however, is used only in cases of 
necessity and is then robbed of its poisonous qualities by wash- 
ing and drying. In manufacture, the root of the sweet variety 
is washed and scraped, grated and beaten to a pulp. The mass 
is then subjected to pressure to express the juice, which, when 
evaporated, gives cassava starch and tapioca. The compressed 
residue is cassava meal, from which cassava bread is made. 
Ground tapioca is sold under the name of granulated or instan- 
taneous tapioca. "Rolled tapioca" is simply rolled before the 
mass of starch is quite dry. The object in grinding or rolling 
is to give shorter time for cooking. The large tapioca requires 
both long soaking and careful cooking to be at all palatable or 
digestible. Pearl tapioca is ground, then moistened and rolled 
into the shape in which it is sold. 

Recipes for tapioca will be found under desserts. 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 

Cassava Bread is really a cassava cake as the meal is inca- 
pable of fermentation with yeast. The meal is moistened with 
salt and water, then patted into flat cakes, and baked slowly 
on a griddle. 

diGO 

True sago is a pure starch made from the central part of sev- 
eral varieties of palms. This portion of the tree is ground, 
washed and strained through fine sieves. The starch is allowed 
to settle and again washed, dried and ground. In some parts 
of the East Indies, a starchy meal is made from the Cycas 
which must not be confounded with true sago. Pearl sago is 
made by mixing water with the dry starch and granulating 
by motion, while the mixture is drying. 

Recipes for the cooking of sago will be found under 
desserts. 

ARROWROOT 

Genuine arrowroot is made from the root stalks of the Maranta 
Arundinacea, Linn. Arrowroot is the smallest of all starch 
granules; under the microscope it resembles closely, with the 
exception of the size, the potato starch. Brazilian arrowroot 
is frequently adulterated with potato or other inferior starches. 
Adulterations can be easily detected, however, by microscopic 
observations. Arrowroot is most easily digested of all starches 
and cooks at the lowest temperature. In thin gruel, the starch 
grains rupture at i8o° Fahr. 

ARROWROOT GRUEL 

Moisten a teaspoonful of arrowroot in four teaspoonfuls of 
cold water. Add a half pint of boiHng water, bring to boiling 
point, and pour, while hot, into the well beaten white of one

TOUS-LES-MOIS 

This is made from the tuber of Canna edulis, and, like arrow- 
root, is very easy of digestion, and cooks at about the same 
temperature. These are the largest of all starch grains, are 
round, with concentric markings and a central hilum. This 
starch is not used to any extent in the United States except by 
the Turks, who make from it a sort of jelly-like, elastic candy, 
called Turkish Delight. 

COMMON MILLET 

Millet is the seed of a plant belonging to the grass family and 
stands midway between wheat and rice. It is not used in the 
United States as human food, except by a few Germans and 
Russians, as a thickening of clear soups. 

The Sorgho grass or East India millet, called dhoora, is 
very similar.

ITALIAN PASTES 

MACARONI 

Italian macaroni has about the same food value as common 
white bread ; it contains both carbonaceous and nitrogenous 
principles ; leaning towards the first is fat, heat and force food. 
The primary digestion begins in the mouth, the nitrogenous 
principles are digested in the stomach, the starchy portion 
finished in the intestines. At dinner the Italian pastes take the 
place of potatoes or rice ; when cooked with cheese and toma- 
toes, or milk and tgg, they make admirable luncheon or supper 
dishes. 

Macaroni with cheese forms an almost typical food. It 
is the bread and meat of the Italian laborer ; even at hard work 
he finds it a satisfying and perfect diet. A few years ago the 
best grades were imported, but now many of the domestic 
articles are superior to those coming from across the water. 
Until within the past few years, macaroni was prepared only 
as a luxury for the tables of the very rich. Even now it is 
sparingly used throughout the country by the American labor- 
ing classes. There is no reason, however, considering its price 
and the ease with which it is prepared, why it should not enter 
extensively into the food of all our people. It is nutritious, 
palatable, sightly and much more easily prepared than many 
of our every-day dishes. It frequently lacks flavor, due, of 
course, to the careless manner of cooking; and this may be one 
reason why it is so little used. The thoughtless cook throws it 
into water that is not hot ; simmers it gently until it is soft and 
pasty; drains it, pours over it a little cream sauce, puts a 
thick layer of chopped cheese on top, and bakes it in the oven. 
It comes to the table a mass of heavy paste. The cheese is hard 
and scorched, and all in all, it is a very uninteresting dish. 
Sir Henry Thompson tells us that " glutin macaroni, weight 
for weight, may be regarded not less valuable in the economy 
than beef or mutton." Served with cheese it is an admirable 
substitute for meat. 

Glutin macaroni has meat value, and may be cooked after 



VEGETABLES 301 

these same rules, allowing thirty minutes for the first cooking 
and at least twenty for the second. 

Serve macaroni with roasted duck, birds or braised beef. 

Serve spaghetti alone as a vegetable course, or with braised 
or roasted beef. 

PREPARATION 

No matter what the final preparation of macaroni or spaghetti 
is to be, the first is always the same. Fill a large kettle partly 
full of rapidly boiling salted water. Throw in the macaroni, 
allow it to boil rapidly for thirty minutes, drain, throw it into 
cold water to blanch for thirty minutes; drain, and it is ready 
to cook. 

TO BOIL SPAGHETTI 

Spaghetti is always served in the long form in which it is pur- 
chased. Grasp the given quantity in your hand ; put the ends 
down into boiling water, and as they soften press gently until 
the whole length is in the water; boil rapidly for twenty min- 
utes. Drain, and blanch in cold water. 

The small Italian pastes used for soups are usually cooked 
a few moments in water, then drained and finished in the 
soup. A half pound will be sufficient to serve six persons. The 
Italians cook it for twenty minutes in water, then finish the 
cooking in stock. Most Americans throw away their stock 
materials and cook the macaroni thirty to forty minutes in 
water. This is one reason for its tasteless condition. A recipe 
given for macaroni may be used equally well for spaghetti, 
except that macaroni is broken, spaghetti cooked and served 
whole. 

MACARONI WITH ASPARAGUS 

Break two ounces of macaroni into four inch pieces ; throw 
them into a kettle of boiling water ; boil twenty minutes. Drain 
and cover with stock. Stand on the back part of the stove where 
the macaroni will simmer, swell, and soak up the stock, fifteen 
minutes longer. While this is cooking, wash the asparagus, 
and cut it into one inch pieces as far as the stalks are tender. 
Throw them into boiling salted water, and boil carefully for 



802 . MRS. rorer's new cook book 

thirty minutes. Drain, season with salt, pepper and butter. 
Turn the asparagus in the centre of the dish, garnish with 
the pipes of boiled macaroni, sprinkle over a little Parmesan, 
and send at once to the table. 

MACARONI WITH BROWN BUTTER 

Boil the macaroni as directed ; cover it with stock, simmer 
gently for twenty minutes, or until the macaroni is rather dark 
and very tender. Drain, and throw it on a heated dish ; dust 
lightly with salt and pepper, and pour over browned butter.

Boil and blanch the macaroni; cut it into lengths of one inch. 
Put the butter and flour into a saucepan, mix until smooth, add 
the stock, stir until boiling, add all the seasoning, then the 
macaroni, stand over hot water for twenty minutes, and it is 
ready to serve. 

The flavor of this may be changed by omitting the tomato 
catsup, and adding tomato paste and a little Worcestershire 
sauce.

MACARONI WITH TOMATO PASTE 

In almost all the Italian shops one can buy tomato " conserve " 
in small cans, for ten cents each. A tablespoonful of this 
conserve will take the place of many times its bulk in tomatoes. 
It is, in my own house, used constantly during the summer 
with beef extract for soups, which saves the purchase and 
keeping of large quantities of meat. For a family of six, boil, 
blanch and drain four ounces of spaghetti or macaroni ; turn 
it into a saucepan. Add a half teaspoonful of beef extract 
dissolved in a half pint of water; stand it over a slow part of 
the fire where it will simmer for twenty minutes. Then add 
a half teaspoonful of salt ; a finely chopped sweet pepper, a tea- 
spoonful of tomato paste dissolved in two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of cream or milk. Stand this over hot water, or over the 
back part of the stove to cook fifteen minutes longer. Pass 
with it Parmesan in a separate dish. To give variety add a 
suspicion of curry powder.

NOODLES 

Noodles are pastes of the macaroni class. They can be pur- 
chased for ten to fifteen cents a pound, and are mostly used in 
chicken stock, for noodle soup. They may, however, be cooked 
and served according to the recipes for spaghetti.

HOME-MADE NOODLES 

Put four tablespoonfuls of flour into an ordinary dinner plate ; 
make a well in the centre, put in an egg well beaten, and mix 
in carefully the flour. When the dough is extremely hard, 
knead and work until it becomes soft and free from stickiness. 
Roll it out in a very thin sheet ; place it on a napkin and hang 
it in the air for about ten minutes until slightly dry ; then roll 
tightly, cut very thin slices from the ,end ; shake them out and 
spread on a paper, and dry in the sun, or warm oven. To keep — 
when perfectly dry, put them in glass jars, fasten, and place in 
a dry closet.

SWEET POTATO (Ipom(ra Batatas, Lamarck) 

Sweet potato belongs to the morning-glory family. The edible 
portion is a swollen side root, not so nutritious or easily 
digested as the common white potato, and in composition 
differs from it in containing more sugar, g^m, dextrin, pec- 
tose, and less starch.

All varieties of sweet potatoes may be cooked after the 
same rules. Containing sugar as well as starch, they are 
easily made pasty or heavy by careless cooking and under 
such conditions are dense and difficult of digestion. Cooked 
with fat they are much more objectionable than white potatoes 
under the same conditions. 

BOILED SWEET POTATOES 

Wash the potatoes carefully without breaking the skin; rinse, 
throw them into boiling water, and cook just at the boiling 
point until you can pierce them to the centre; they must not, 
however, be soft. Drain off every particle of water, put them 
into a baking-pan, and stand them in a quick oven to dry. In 
this way they will be mealy. Sweet potatoes must be peeled 
after they are cooked. The better way is to take the potato in 
a towel or napkin and with a dull knife scrape off the skin. 
Put the potatoes back into the baking-pan as fast as you peel 
them to keep them hot. 

BOILED AND BAKED SWEET POTATOES 

After they have been boiled according to the preceding recipe, 
scrape off the skins, cut them into halves, put them flat side 
down in a baking pan. Baste them with melted butter, dust 
thickly with sugar, and bake in a quick oven until a golden 
brown. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES, SOUTHERN 
FASHION 

Boil sweet potatoes until they are partly done; remove the 
skins; cut them into slices; put a layer of these slices in the

bottom of the baking dish, sprinkle over two tablespoon fills 
of sugar, another layer of potatoes, and a sprinkling of sugar. 
Add a half cup of boiling water ; cover the dish and cook in a 
moderate oven until they are soft and transparent. Serve in the 
dish in which they were baked. 

MASHED SWEET POTATOES 

Wash and rinse the potatoes; bake them until they are soft 
when pressed in the hand. Break the skin and scoop out the 
potato ; put it through a vegetable press or colander. To each 
half dozen potatoes allow a tablespoonful of butter, a level 
teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper. Beat until light, 
holding the pan over hot water or a moderate fire. Turn into 
an uncovered dish and serve at once. 



SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES 

Roll mashed sweet potatoes into cylinder-shaped croquettes. 
Beat an egg, without separating, with a tablespoonful of water 
until thoroughly mixed. Dip the croquettes in the Qgg, roll 
them in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat. 



BAKED SWEET POTATOES 

Scrub and wash sweet potatoes until perfectly clean, being 
careful not to break the skin. Put them into a baking pan and 
bake in a moderate oven until they are soft to the very centre. 
Try by taking them up in a towel in the hands ; you can easily 
tell by the slightest pressure when they are soft ; do not puncture 
with a fork. Serve on a folded napkin. 

Left-over sweet potatoes may be made into stuffed sweet 
potatoes. 

STUFFED SWEET POTATOES 

Cut baked sweet potatoes into halves, lengthwise; scoop out 
the centre without breaking the skin and put it through a colan- 
der or vegetable press. Add to each pint a level tablespoonful 



«^14 MRS. kORER*S NEW COOK BOOK 

of butter, a level teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Beat until thoroughly mixed; add a teaspoonful of onion 
juice, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a saltspoonful of 
mace. Mix and put the mixture into the skins. Brush the 
tops with beaten egg and brown in a quick oven. Serve with 
broiled chicken. 



FRENCH FRIED SWEET POTATOES 

Peel the sweet potatoes, cut them into slices a quarter of an 
inch thick, lengthwise. Have ready a kettle of hot fat, about 
300° Fahr. Put a few slices at a time in the frying basket, 
plunge them into the hot fat and cook slowly until perfectly 
brown ; drain on brown paper. Dust with salt and send at 
once to the table. If perfectly cooked these will be free from 
grease. 

Serve as an accompaniment to broiled or baked birds. 



BROILED SWEET POTATOES 

Cut peeled raw sweet potatoes into slices a quarter of an inch 
thick, dip them in melted butter, dust with salt and pepper, 
broil over a clear fire, for five minutes, turning once. Serve 
at once with baked or broiled partridges. 



YAMS 

Yams look and taste like sweet potatoes and may be cooked 
after the same rules. They do not, however, belong to the 
same order of plants. The common yam is Dioscorea A lata, 
but other species of the same genus are used. The Chinese 
yam {Dioscorea Batatas) is imported into the United States 
and used by many in place of our common sweet potatoes. They 
are exceedingly large, frequently weighing from two to four or 
six pounds. The so-called yam of the Southern United States 
is simply a larger variety of the common sweet potato.

WINTER SQUASH (Cucurbita maxima, Duchesne) 

The recipes given may be tised for such varieties as the Hub- 
bard, Boston Marrow and the Cashaw squash. 

Like other vegetables in this group, the winter squash is 
served in place of potatoes or rice ; it is not, however, so rich in 
nourishment, but gives variety to the daily menu. 



BAKED SQUASH 

Wash and wipe the squash; saw into halves and then into 
quarters ; remove the seeds. Stand the squash, skin side down, 
in a baking-pan, bake in a moderately quick oven about one 
hour or until tender. Dish on a platter, covered with a dainty 
napkin, and send at once to the table. 

Serve by scooping out the flesh with a tablespoon. This 
may be served with beef or chicken and will take the place of 
sweet potato. 

PANNED BAKED SQUASH 

Saw the squash into small strips and remove the rind. Cut 
the pieces into two-inch lengths ; throw them into boiling water, 
cook slowly for twenty minutes and drain. Arrange them in a 
baking-pan ; dust each layer with a tablespoonful of sugar ; 
cut two tablespoonfuls of butter into bits, put them over the 
top; add a half cup of water; cover the dish and bake in a 
slow oven for one hour, or until the squash is soft and trans- 
parent. Serve, in an uncovered vegetable dish, with broiled 
steak or roasted poultry. 



316 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

SQUASH, MASHED 

Peel and cut the squash into pieces. Steam or boil until per- 
fectly tender; drain, and mash through a colander. To each 
pint allow a level tablespoonful of butter, a half teaspoonful 
of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Mix thoroughly and 
serve at once. 

SQUASH CROQUETTES 

These are usually made from left-over baked squash, or squash 
may be baked for the purpose. When thoroughly tender, put it 
through a vegetable press. To each pint allow a half cup of 
soft, fine bread crumbs, a level teaspoonful of salt, a level table- 
spoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of pepper. Mix thoroughly 
over the fire ; take from the fire and turn out to cool. When 
cold form into cylinder-shaped croquettes; dip in beaten egg, 
roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat. 

COMMON PUMPKIN (Cucurbita Pepo, Linn.) 
BAKED PUMPKIN 

Cut a large ripe pumpkin into halves, crosswise; remove the 
seeds from one-half, put the remaining half away to use another 
time. After taking out the seeds cut this half into quarters ; 
place skin-side down in a baking-pan, and bake in a mod- 
erate oven for three-quarters of an hour. Do not have the oven 
sufficiently hot to color or blacken the skin. Arrange neatly 
on a platter and send to the table. Serve them by tablespoon- 
fuls the same as baked squash. Eat with salt, pepper and 
butter. Serve with boiled salted meat. 

Baked pumpkins form a very palatable winter vegetable. 

BOILED PUMPKIN 

Cut the pumpkin into strips, pare and remove the seeds. Put 
these strips into a saucepan, cover with boiling water and cook 
slowly until perfectly tender ; drain in a colander. Turn them 
into a vegetable dish, and cover with white or cream sauce. 
Serve with roasted duck or goose.

a level teaspoonful of salt, saltspoonful of pepper. Dish and 
serve the same as sweet potatoes. 

Serve with panned or roasted rabbit. 

TO DRY PUMPKIN 

Pare, cut into thin strips, then into pieces. Spread on boards 
and dry in the sun or warm oven. Keep in tin boxes or in glass 
jars in a dry closet. 

To cook — soak over night in cold water; then proceed the 
same as for fresh pumpkin. 

PUMPKIN TIMBALE 

Add to one pint of mashed pumpkin the yolks of four eggs 
well beaten, a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Mix well and fill in custard or timbale cups. Stand in a baking- 
pan of boiling water and bake in a quick oven, twenty minutes. 
When done turn carefully from the cups, and send to the table. 
Serve with roasted duck or hot boiled ham. 



A GROUP OF SUCCULENT VEGETABLES 

CONTAINING A LITTLE STARCH 

AND SUGAR 

In this group will be found succulent vegetables containing 
about an equal amount of starch and sugar ; not enough, how- 
ever, to take the place of rice or potato, but sufficient to make 
them objectionable to diabetic persons. They are not valuable 
nutrients, and are placed among succulent vegetables as con- 
taining mineral matter and the necessary bulk. 

SALSIFY 

Salsify or oyster plant (Tragopogon porrifolius, Linn.) is an 
edible root resembling a small parsnip, and may be cooked and 



318 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

served according to the same rules. Owing to a peculiar fishy 
flavor it is frequently called vegetable oyster, and is used by 
vegetarians in imitation of the real oyster. It makes a delicious 
mock oyster soup ; a recipe for which will be found under soups. 

MOCK OYSTERS 

I dozen oyster plants i saltspoonful of pepper 

I teispoonful of salt 3 eggs 

Scrape the salsify and throw it into cold water to prevent dis- 
coloration. Cover with boiling water, cook slowly for three- 
quarters of an hour until tender; drain, and press through a 
colander. Add the salt, pepper and the eggs well beaten. 
Cover the bottom of a baking or saute pan with suet or oil, 
or lard if you use it. When hot drop in the mixture by spoon- 
fuls, making each the shape of an oyster. Brown carefully on 
one side, turn and brown the other. Serve at once with 
tomato catsup, as a supper or luncheon dish. 

SCALLOPED SALSIFY 

Scrape and boil the salsify until tender, cut it into thin slices. 
To each dozen roots allow a half pint of white sauce. Put a 
layer of the sauce in the bottom of a baking-dish, .then a layer 
of salsify, just a suspicion of celery seed, not more than a salt- 
spoonful to the whole dish; then another layer of sauce, and 
so continue until the dish is full. Cover the top with bread 
crumbs and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. 

BROWNED SALSIFY 

Scrape and boil the salsify until tender; drain and put them 
into a baking dish. Dissolve four tablespoonfuls of sugar in 
a half cup of water, pour this over the salsify, and bake in a 
quick oven until a golden brown, basting once or twice. 

SALSIFY WITH BROWN SAUCE 

Scrape and boil the salsify, cut it into thin slices. Rub together 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour, adding a pint 
of the water in which the salsify was boiled ; stir until boiling,

add a tablespoonful of chopped onion, a bay leaf, a teaspoon- 
ful of kitchen bouquet and the salsify. Cook slowly for fifteen 
minutes and serve. 



SALSIFY WITH CREAM SAUCE

Cut them in thin slices ; cover with boiling water, cook until 
tender, about a half hour. Drain, dish and cover with a pint of 
cream sauce. Serve with boiled salt fish or baked salt mackerel. 



PARSNIPS 

Parsnip is the root of the Pastinaca sativa, Linn. It resem- 
bles the carrot in general appearance, except that it is white, 
and contains both sugar and starch. Being rich in woody 
fibre, the parsnip must be carefully cooked to be palatable and 
wholesome; they are usually served as an accompaniment to 
salt fish,

It will be seen that string beans are not rich in nourishment 
and may well be placed with the green or succulent vegetables. 
They contain sufficient starch and sugar, however, to be detri- 
mental to diabetic persons. To be easily digested and palatable 
they must be used fresh and while the pod is young and tender. 
String beans are waste or bulk food and are principally digested 
in the intestines.

A GROUP OF VEGETABLES CONTAINING 
NITROGEN AND STARCH 

Old dried peas Lrentils 

Old dried beans of all varieties Chick peas 

Ground or peanuts 

To this same family belong clover, alfalfa, cow pea, and many 
other plants of economic importance. This group contains 
edible leguminous seeds, characterized by the large amount of 
nitrogenous matter they contain. As flesh formers or muscle 
and tissue building foods, they far excel the seeds of the cereal 
grasses. The amount of nitrogen in dry beans is double that 
in mature wheat. The albuminoids are present in a substance 
known as legumin, a vegetable casein. The Chinese take 
advantage of this peculiar form of nitrogen, and by certain 
methods make the pulp of both old peas and beans into a 
cheese which very closely resembles that made from cows* milk. 
These vegetables, being rich in nitrogen, should be used in the 
place of meat, not with meat, and should be served with foods 
containing non-nitrogenous or carbonaceous nutrients; for 
instance, fat pork and beans, rice and lentils, dried peas and 
bacon are samples of the best form of blending. 

Legumin is digested and absorbed at a slower rate than the 
albuminoids of milk, eggs and meat; hence, these vegets^bles 



324 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



are unfit for daily food for persons whose occupation confines 
them in close and ill-ventilated rooms, or where little exercise 
can be taken. They are exceedingly valuable for the outdoor 
laborer; being less in price they may be substituted frequently 
for meat. 

PEAS 

Peas (Pisum sativum, Linn.) are the seeds of a leguminous 
plant. When mature and ripe (old and dried) they contain 
according to Payne 

Nitrogenous matter 23.8 

Starch, etc 58.7 

Cellulose 3.5 

Fatty matter 2. 1 

Mineral matter 2. 1 

Water 8.3 

Church in his analysis finds three per cent, mineral matter, 
a little more fat and cellulose, less starch and nitrogenous 
matter and fourteen per cent, of water. It is sufficient to know, 
however, that they are very rich in nitrogen, and have a meat 
value. 

Nitrogenous foods are principally digested in the stomach 
and are muscle and tissue builders. Peas contain starch and 
fat, both carbonaceous elements. Starches are digested in the 
small intestines and fats are emulsionized. While peas con- 
tain nitrogenous matter and starch, the starch is insufficient 
to make a balanced ration. Serve with them fat, as bacon, 
or other starchy food, as potatoes or rice. Served with fat 
and starch, as white bread and butter, they form a typical 
food, and one would have in this combination a highly 
nutritious diet. It is estimated by Hutchinson that a level 
tablespoonful of peameal made into a plate of thick water soup 
will have the proteid value of one ounce of meat. If milk 
mstead of water is used, the proteid would be at least double. 
Old or dried peas must be soaked over night that they may 
take up the same amount of water with which they parted 
in the drying. This reduces their nutritive value from the 
table given.

The field pea (Pisum arvense, Linn.), sometimes called the 
commercial pea, is not used in this country as food for man. 

The chick pea (Cicer arietinum, Linn.) is not commonly 
known to American people; it can be purchased, however, 
in some of the Jewish markets of New York. It is highly 
nitrogenous, and is said to be the pulse referred to in the Bible. 
It is usually toasted and eaten the same as peanuts. It is used 
in small quantities in Spain and extensively in the East. The 
Arabs when crossing the desert carry chick peas, feeling that 
they have with them a typical or perfect food. 

Split peas are dried peas with the tough envelope removed, 
which allows them to divide easily into halves ; they are much 
more easily cooked than those dried in the husk or skin. 

Young or green peas served as succulent vegetables, not 
rich in nitrogen, are considered under vegetables containing 
sugar. 

PUREE OF PEAS 

Wash one pint of dried peas, cover with cold water and soak 
them over night. Next morning drain, cover with two quarts 
of fresh cold water and bring slowly to boiling point. Add a 
saltspoonful of bi-carbonate of soda and cook slowly for about 
three hours. Then press the whole through a colander, return 
the puree to the soup kettle, add a level teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of white pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and two of flour rubbed together. Turn into this a quart of 
hot milk, and when the puree again reaches the boiling \xnnt 
strain it through a fine sieve and serve with tiny croiitons. 
Stock or water may be used in the place of milk ; the latter 
gives added nourishment. 

This recipe will answer also for Puree of Split Peas.

BEANS 
KIDNEY BEANS (Phaseolus vulgaris, Linn.) 

This one variety covers nearly all the beans in common use as 
food for man. The common soup or kidney bean, the Boston 
white beans used for baking, and the red bean may all be 
cooked in precisely the same manner. Haricots are small 
white beans. While the different varieties give just a trifle 
more or less nitrogenous matter, one analysis will serve for the 
whole. 

The broad or Windsor bean (Faba vulgaris, Moench) is 
said to contain more nitrogen than other varieties.

All beans as butter, kidney, caseknife and flageolets may be 
cooked in precisely the same manner. The main points to be 
remembered are that all dried beans must be soaked over night 
in cold water, and cooked in soft, unsalted water just at or 
below the boiling point, not boiled rapidly. Water rapidly 
boiled is precisely the same in temperature as that boiled slowly, 
but the motion of the water washes off the outside of the beans 
and destroys their texture. 

KIDNEY BEANS 

These are a fresh shell bean, sold in pods like lima beans. The 
bean is small and shaped like a kidney. Shell and wash them 
in cold water; throw them into a kettle of boiling, unsalted 
water; cook slowly for forty-five minutes. Drain and season 
with a half teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and a 
tablespoonful of butter to each pint; or use cream and omit 
the butter, or they may be simply served plain with tomato 
sauce.

KIDNEY BEANS WITH BROWN SAUCE 

I quart of kidney beans 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 

I teaspoonful of salt 2 tablespoonfuls of flour 

I slice of onion i sweet chilli 

I pound of soup meat 2 tablespoonfuls of thick tomato 

Put the beans into a saucepan ; add the meat chopped fine, cover 
with boiling water and cook gently thirty minutes ; then add a 
teaspoonful of salt and cook thirty minutes longer. Put the 
butter in a saucepan, add the flour, mix and add the tomato, 
the chilli mashed or chopped very fine, a half teaspoonful of 
kitchen bouquet, and a pint of the water in which the beans 
were boiled; stir until boiling; add a teaspoonful of grated 
onion juice or just a suspicion of garlic, a half teaspoonful of 
salt, and a dash of white pepper. Strain this sauce into the 
beans that have been carefully drained ; re-heat over hot water 
and use in the place of meat. Serve with plain boiled rice. 

DRIED BEANS 

These may be of almost any kind or color. Black beans, how- 
ever, are as a rule used for soup making; the white and red 
beans are served in the place of meat. Every variety must be 
washed well, soaked over night and the next morning put into 
a kettle of boiling water and boiled until tender. Drain, cover 
with fresh cold water, and cook slowly about two hours. If 
boiled rapidly the skin will break and spoil the shape of the 
bean. When tender, drain and add salt, pepper and butter. 
The water in which dried beans are boiled may be saved for 
bean broth and soups; or with left-over beans for puree.

push to the back part of the stove for twenty minutes. Then 
add one quart of cold water ; bring to boiling point and add 
the beans, tied loosely in a piece of cheesecloth, sugar and 
pepper. Scald and peel one sweet chilli, chop fine and add it 
to the mixture. Cover and cook slowly until the beans are 
tender, about an hour and a half; then add the salt. Remove 
the beans, strain the sauce, add to it the beans and add the 
butter. The mixture should have boiled down just sufficient 
to cover the beans. 

Serve with rice or boiled chestnuts.

cream sauce. 

BEAN BALLS 

These are made precisely the same as Polenta, omitting the 
mustard. When cold, form into cylinders, or small balls^, dip 
in beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. Serve

put them into a kettle of boiling water and boil until the skins 
will crack when you blow on them. They must not be soft. 
Score the rind of the pork and boil it with the beans. When 
the skin of the beans cracks, take them from the fire ; drain and 
turn them at once into the bean pot ; bury the pork in the centre 
until only the scored skin remains above the beans. Put a tea- 
spoonful of salt and the molasses into one pint of the water in 
which the beans were boiled; mix and pour over the beans in 
the pot. This should just come to the surface. Put on the 
lid and bake in a moderate oven from six to eight hours. Add 
more of the bean water as that in the pot evaporates. If prop- 
erly done each bean will be soft; no two beans should stick 
together. The water will have entirely evaporated and the 
beans be a dark, rich brown in color. If the beans have been 
boiled too long they will not keep shape in baking. 



BAKED BEANS WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Boil the beans as directed in preceding recipe. Spread them 
out and when cold carefully *'pulp" each one. This renders 
them much more digestible and wholesome. Put the beans in 
a bean pot. Add a teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of 
sugar to one quart of strained tomato. Pour this over the 
beans, cover the pot and bake slowly from four to six hours. 
Pork may be added the same as in preceding recipe ; or better, 
chopped nuts or suet in layers with beans. Use a mixture of 
Brazilian and pine-nuts.

spoonful of butter, and four tablespoonfuls of hot milk ; beat 
until light; then fold in the well beaten whites of two eggs; 
turn this into a baking dish and bake in a moderate oven 
twenty minutes. This dish has meat value. 

LIMA BEANS (Phaseolus lunatus, Linn.) 

These beans are both "climbers" and "bush." They are char- 
acterized by being flat and larger than the ordinary kidney 
bean, and contain a trifle more starch and less nitrogen. As 
the hull of beans is indigestible, it is always wise to blanch 
and remove, or "pulp" them. Cook carefully that they may 
become soft without falling apart. 

TO COOK LIMA BEANS

Wash the beans in cold water, put them into a saucepan, cover 
with boiling water and add half the salt. Boil gently for twenty 
minutes or until they are perfectly tender. Drain the beans in 
a colander and "pulp" them gently as you would slip almonds 
from the skins. Return them to the saucepan, - dd the cream 
and the remaining salt and pepper. Stand the saucepan over 
a moderate fire until the beans and cream are thoroughly heated.

The outside skin or covering of beans is exceedingly indi- 
gestible and should always be removed before serving. They 
may be served with simply a seasoning of salt, pepper and 
butter. 

Cold lima beans may be mixed with other vegetables and 
used in salads. 

LIMA BEAN CAKES 

Press cold left-over lima beans through a fine sieve. To each 
half pint add the yolk of one egg, a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, a half teaspoonful of onion juice. Form into little

Press left-over boiled lima beans through a sieve, and to each 
half pint add the yolks of two eggs, beat, and fold in the well 
beaten whites. Turn in a baking pan, and bake in a quick oven 
twenty minutes. 

BLACK OR TURTLE BE ANS (D oHc hos Lablab.Unn.) 

On account of the black coloring matter contained in these 
seeds, they are used principally for mock turtle soup, or what 
is commonly known as black bean soup. They are, however, 
excellent when well cooked, pressed through a colander, and 
served in puree. 

RED BEANS 

The red Mexican beans are simply a variety of kidney bean. 
The flesh of the bean is perfectly white; the outside skin 
is red, and during the cooking colors the centre of the bean. 
With tomato and chilli sauce these make an admirable dinner 
dish and take the place of meat. Macaroni or spaghetti are 
usually served with them. 

SOY BEAN (Glycine hispida, M2ix.{m.) 

Soy beans are grown principally in China where they form an 
important article of food ; in fact, they are the richest of all in 
food constituents. It is also grown to a considerable extent in 
India, where it is mixed with rice. This bean ranks high in fat 
and albuminoids and is their only muscle-making food. It has 
more than meat value. By the Chinese it is made into cheese, 
pastes and sauces. Soy sauce is used by them on all meat and 
fish dishes. For the English and Americans it forms the foun- 



VEGETABLES 335 

dation for such sauces as club-house and Worcestershire. Soy 
is an agreeable seasoning to creamed meat dishes and a very 
pleasant addition to French salad dressing. It can be pur- 
chased in jugs at any Chinese shop, or at the American whole- 
sale druggists by measure.

The red, or Arabian lentils, are rich in iron, rarely ever 
;ome to this country, and when they do, only in small quanti- 
ties, and sell at a high price. The Revelenta arahica, sold at a 
'dollar a pound, is red lentil flour, used principally with milk 
for making soup or gruel for nursing mothers; it is said to 
produce milk of excellent quality. It is also used in purees or 
souffles in cases of neurasthenia. 

Lentils should be served in every household at least once a 
week. They form an excellent substitute for flesh. In appear- 
ance they resemble a dark, tiny split pea ; they are round but 
flat, not globular, like peas. While extensively grown in the 
United States they are principally used by the Germans.

STEWED LENTILS WITH RICE 

Cook the lentils according to the preceding recipe. While they 
are cooking, boil, drain and dry a half pint of rice ; put a table- 
spoonful of butter in a saucepan, add four tablespoonfuls of 
chopped onion; cook carefully without browning the butter 
until the onion is soft. Add the lentils, drained, shake the 
saucepan over the fire until they are thoroughly hot; add the 
rice ; toss the whole well together, and add a level teaspoonful 
of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and serve at once. 

With a carefully cooked green vegetable, these will form

thoroughly ; form into cylinder shaped croquettes ; dip in egg, 
roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat. Serve plain or with 
tomato sauce. 

LENTILS, EGYPTIAN STYLE 

Boil the lentils as directed in preceding recipe. Boil an equal 
quantity of rice. While they are boiling strain one pint of 
stewed tomatoes; add a bay leaf, a good-sized onion, chopped 
fine, and a blade of mace. Cook until reduced one-half; strain. 
When the lentils are done, drain, mix them with the rice, turn 
into a heated dish and press a few cardamom seeds here and 
there into the mass. Season the tomato with a level teaspoonful 
of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper ; stir in quickly a rounding 
tablespoonful of butter, and strain it over the lentils and rice. 
This is a sightly and attractive dinner dish, and has meat value. 
Cocoanut fat, or oUve oil, may be used in the place of butter.

A GROUP OF VEGETABLES CONTAINING 

NITROGENOUS MATTER WITHOUT 

STARCH OR SUGAR 

MUSHROOMS 

All the mushrooms and truffles belong to a large group of 
fungi, plants void of chlorophyll. They are placed among 
the nitrogenous foods, that is they do not contain starch or 
sugar. They consist, however, of 90% water. Of the remain- 
ing 10% a portion is vegetable fibre. They are food adjuncts, 
or flavoring, rather than true foods. 

They do not contain suflicient nitrogenous matter to take 
the place of meat. To obtain from them the proper amount of 
nourishment one would be obliged to eat them in large quan- 
tities; as they are dense and difficult of digestion, this would 
be impracticable and dangerous. 

A cook-book is scarcely the proper place to discuss mush- 
rooms; the subject is too large for the available space. A few 
recipes for the cooking and preserving of the more common 
varieties will, I am sure, be of great service. 

The question, how can one be sure of "mushrooms" or 
"toadstools," is an important one. The average person calls 
the edible varieties mushrooms, the poisonous ones toadstools;. 



\. 



VEGETABLES 339 

The fact is, however, that they are all toadstools or all mush- 
rooms. Some are poisonous, others edible. The question 
reverts then, to how can one be sure of knowing the poisonous 
from the edible varieties. 

Let me emphatically state that there is no royal road to 
distinguishing the poisonous from the edible mushrooms ; one 
must know all their characteristics, habitat and general appear- 
ance. All of the common tests, as the gold ring or silver spoon, 
are fallacies. 

In certain parts of the country the common people use the 
Morel, calling it a mushroom and every other variety a toad- 
stool. In many States the Agaricus campestris is known as 
the mushroom, and all others are toadstools. In Maine, espe- 
cially on some of the coast islands, the Cantharellus is the 
mushroom. So that the term mushroom or toadstool is not 
applied to the same fungus in different places. 

Avoid all mushrooms that have a veil hanging in a form of 
skirt from the stem and those having a cup or volva in the 
ground out of which the stem seems to be growing. While 
"veils" may be found on other mushrooms, they are sure to be 
'found on the poisonous ones. Avoid such mushrooms; do not 
even taste them, for the poisonous ones are very deadly. 

Mushrooms differ in analysis and density of flesh as well 
as in flavor, hence, different methods of cooking are desirable. 
The Coprinus micaceus and Lepiota procera are easily de- 
stroyed by long and severe cooking. The more dense and 
common Agaricus campestris, and some varieties of the Boleti, 
require long slow cooking to make them tender, digestible, 
and bring out the flavor. Simplicity in seasoning is desirable ; 
wine, mustard, onion or any other decided flavors will entirely 
overpower the delicate mushroom flavor. 

All mushrooms are best cooked without peeling, with the 
exception of the puff ball, which should always be pared. In 
washing take one mushroom in each hand, gill sides down; 
wash them quickly by plunging them in and out of the water 
while rubbing the caps with the thumbs; shake and throw 
them into a colander. 

Recipes for Agaricus campestris will answer for all other 



840 

mushrooms which have firm, solid flesh, as the Cantharellus, 
Agaricus Arvensis, Armillaria mellca, Paxillus rhodoxanthus, 
Hypholoma perplexum, Lactarius deliciosus, Lactarius volemus, 
Marasmius oreades, and the Russiilce. Riissida virescens is 
excellent raw, in salads. The Coprini are best baked or 
panned, the Lepiota broiled or panned, the Morchella {morel) 
stuffed and baked, the puff ball sliced and sauted. 

The Agaricus campestris grows in old pasture fields and 
along the roadside and often in gardens. It is usually found 
in the sod. The cap is first rounded, as it grows, expands and 
shows the gills, which are at first pink, growing a dark brown 
as the mushroom ages. The flesh is white, the gills are free 
from the stem, the flesh of both the cap and stem solid. It is 
the common pasture or meadow mushroom, and is, perhaps, 
the most widely known and collected of all mushrooms. It is 
this variety that is cultivated in cellars and caves. 

AGARICUS CAMPESTRIS 

Cut the stems close to the gills. These may be put aside to use 
for flavoring sauce or soup. Wash carefully, gill sides down. 
Throw them into a colander to drain. To each pound allow 
two ounces of butter. Put the butter in a saucepan; when 
melted, not browned, throw in the mushrooms, either whole or 
cut into slices. Sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt, a half 
saltspoonful of pepper; cover the saucepan closely and cook 
over a very slow fire for twenty minutes. Moisten a rounding 
tablespoonful of flour in a little cold milk. When perfectly 
smooth, add a half cup of milk. Strain this into the mush- 
rooms ; stir carefully until boiling. Serve at once, either plain 
or on toast. This also makes a good sauce to serve with broiled 
or panned chicken. To serve with steak, cook the mushrooms 
until tender, in butter, season with salt and pepper only. Do 
not add either flour or milk. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS 

Cut the stems close to the gills ; wash as directed and put them 
in a wire broiler and broil, gill side down, for five minutes ; turn, 
put in the centre of each a piece of butter the size of a pea. 



VEGETABLES 



341 



Dust lightly with salt and pepper, and broil over a mild fire, 
skin side down, for five minutes. Have ready squares of neatly 
toasted buttered bread. Place on top the mushrooms, skin side 
down, and send at once to the table. 

PANNED MUSHROOMS 

Wash one pound of mushrooms and cut the stems as in pre- 
ceding recipes. Crowd them, skin side down, in a baking pan. 
Dust lightly with salt and pepper and pour over a tablespoonful 
of melted butter. Bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. While 
these are cooking, toast squares of bread, and put them on a 
hot platter. Heap on top the mushrooms and baste with the 
sauce in the bottom of the pan. If the pan is dry add a half 
cup of milk. 

MUSHROOMS IN A CHAFING DISH 

Wash, stem and cut the mushrooms into thin slices. To each 
pound allow two ounces of butter. Put the butter in the 
chafing dish ; when melted put in the mushrooms, sprinkle with 
a level teaspoonful of salt and a half teaspoonful of pepper. 
Cover the dish ; cook slowly five minutes, stirring once or twice. 
Moisten a level tablespoonful of flour in a little cold milk ; add 
one gill of milk. Add this to the mushrooms, cover the dish 
and cook three minutes longer. Serve at once from the dish. 
The well beaten yolks of two eggs and a half cup of cream 
may be substituted for flour and milk. Stir and serve the 
moment the eggs are added or the mixture will curdle. 

UNDER A MUSHROOM BELL 

Cut rounds from slices of bread, with an ordinary biscuit cutter. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan to melt. Toast 
the bread ; arrange the slices in the bottom of a mushroom dish. 
Wash, stem and drain the mushrooms. Put three or four on 
each slice of bread, heaping them in the centre. Baste with 
melted butter; dust them with salt and pepper, and pour into 
the dish six tablespoonfuls of good cream. Cover with the 



342 

"bells,'' stand them in a baking pan and then in a hot oven for 
twenty minutes. Send to the table without lifting the "bells." 
In this way one gets the full aroma of the mushrooms. 

This recipe is arranged for individual "bells." The portion 
will be the same where one large "bell" is used for the entire 
pound. 

COPRINUS, THE INKY MUSHROOM 

Coprinus comatus is another well known variety of the more 
common mushrooms. These are found growing along rail- 
roads, especially where soft and hard coal are transported. 
Also in mining localities and on ash "dumps." In the soft coal 
districts of Illinois this mushroom grows most plentifully. It 
is readily recognized by its black spores. As it grows to matur- 
ity the gills seem to dissolve into a sort of inky fluid. The 
young plants or buttons have white gills which turn black as 
the spores mature. The cap has a rough shaggy appearance, 
hence, the common name, "shaggy mane." In appearance it 
is like a tiny umbrella closed down to the stem. The stem is 
hollow, loose from the cap and is easily taken out. 

Coprinus atramentarius, the companion of the comatus, 
is also edible. The cap of this variety is smooth and does not 
so closely hug the stem. It also has white gills in a very young 
stage. The skin of the cap is smooth and of a grayish color, 
but in a short time it begins to spread and the gills turn very 
black from discoloration of the spores, and the edges begin to 
melt away. Both these varieties are not only edible, but exceed- 
ingly delicate and palatable. In the Eastern part of the United 
States they appear in the early summer, and continue until 
November. In Illinois they are most plentiful in September 
and October. 

Coprinus micaceiis, a tiny little mushroom, soft and easily 
digested, is another variety of this "inky" group. The caps of 
these are tan color, and the size of a large thimble. They grow 
in huge groups around trees, especially elms. I have seen as 
many as two hundred in a single bunch. These are said to be 
the most easily digested of all mushrooms. They have black 
spores, as black as ink, after cooking. 



VEGETABLES 343 

The following- recipe will answer for all soft and juicy mush- 
rooms as the comatus and atramentarius or micaceiis. Remove 
the stems, wash carefully, throw them into a colander to drain. 
Melt a tablespoonful of butter in a shallow baking pan, put in 
the mushrooms, crowding them together in two layers. Dust 
with a half teaspoonful of salt and a half saltspoonful of pepper. 
Cook slowly in a moderate oven a half hour. Serve at once on 
a hot dish, garnished with triangular bits of toast. 

Add a cup of cream to the pan, heat quickly and pour it over 
the mushrooms. 



COPRINUS MICACEUS, STEAMED 

Remove the stems, wash the mushrooms and throw them into 
a colander. To each quart allow a tablespoonful of butter. 
Put the butter in a saucepan, add the mushrooms, cover closely. 
Place them over a slow fire for five minutes. Lift the mush- 
rooms with a skimmer and put them into another saucepan. 
Add a half teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and 
four tablespoonfuls of milk to the liquor; boil rapidly for five 
minutes. Dish the mushrooms on toast, pour over the sauce 
and serve at once. 

LEPIOTA PROCERA 

This is the "parasol" mushroom, or "Scotch bonnet." It grows 
in pastures, along the edges of woods, along roadsides at the 
edge of woods, and sometimes in the shady spots in gardens. 
The cap is oval at first, umbonate at the centre when expanded. 
When fully grown frequently measures from six to seven 
inches in diameter. The surface of the cap is reddish brown, 
in wet weather ofttimes quite pale. As the cap expands, the 
darker brown surface is torn and remains in scales all over 
the surface of the cap. The stem is round, "stuffed," and has 
a prominent ring just below the gills. This ring differs from a 
"veil" in that it is free from the stem and can be moved up and 
down. This variety is, of all mushrooms, the richest in flavor. 
They may be easily dried and are the best variety for catsup. 



344 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

BAKED LEPIOTA PROCERA 

The flesh of the cap being thin the gills dry easily. To be good 
they must be cooked quickly. Remove the stems ; take the 
mushroom in your hand, cap side up, and wash each separately 
with a soft piece of cheese cloth; dip it into water and rub 
lightly the cap. This will remove the brown scales and leave 
the gills dry. Grease a baking pan with butter; put in the 
mushrooms, skin side down. Bake in a quick oven ten min- 
utes; baste the gills lightly with melted butter, dust with salt 
and pepper, and serve quickly. 

Or put them in a broiler, broil five minutes, turning once; 
baste with a little butter, dust with salt and pepper, and serve at 
once on heated platter. These, if overcooked, become leathery, 
tasteless and dry. Cook quickly and eat at once. 

PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS 

These are commonly called the "oyster" mushroom, on account 
of their odor. They grow in groups or clusters on trunks and 
branches of trees, either with a short side stem or directly out 
from the wood, without stem. The spores are white. For the 
best results select young plants, as they grow woody with age. 

^'OYSTER" MUSHROOM SOUP 

Wash and shake the mushrooms ; cut them into strips crosswise 
of the gills, rejecting the woody portion on the stem side. To 
each pound of these strips allow a tablespoonful of butter, a 
half teaspoonful of salt, a half saltspoonful of pepper. Put the 
butter into the saucepan, add the mushrooms, sprinkle over the 
salt and pepper. Cover and stew slowly for twenty minutes. 
Moisten a tablespoonful of flour in a little cold milk, then add 
a half pint of milk. Strain into the mushrooms. Stew gently 
for five minutes and add another half pint of milk with a 
grating of nutmeg. Serve with oyster crackers the same as 
oyster soup. 

To serve as a Stew omit the last milk and nutmeg ; add the 
beaten yolk of one tg^ and pour the mixture over nicely toasted 
bread.

MOCK OYSTERS 

Trim the oyster mushrooms into the shape of oysters. Dust 
with salt and pepper. Beat an egg without separating and add 
a tablespoonful of warm water; beat again. Dip the mush- 
rooms first in the tgg, then in the bread crumbs, and fry in hot 
fat, just as you would oysters. Serve at once. 

CLAVARIA 

Clavaria or coral mushroom grows in large bunches in woods. 
One variety is saffron color, another white, another a bluish 
gray; all are exceedingly delicate and tender. These are best 
pickled or deviled. 

DEVILED CLAVARIA 

Wash, separate the bunches and cut them fine. Measure ; allow 
to each quart a half pint of white sauce. Throw the Clavaria 
into a saucepan, cover and steam on the back part of the stove 
while you make the sauce. Take from the fire, add the Clavaria, 
a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, and the yolks of two 
eggs ; turn the mixture into a baking dish, sprinkle the top with 
bread crumbs and brown in a quick oven. 

PICKLED CLAVARIA 

Wash thoroughly without breaking. Put into a steamer and 
steam continuously for fifteen minutes. Take from the fire, 
and when cool pack in glass jars. Heat sufficient vinegar to 
cover; to each quart allow two bay leaves, six cloves, a tea- 
spoonful of whole mustard, one dozen pepper corns. Bring 
to the boiling point. Pour over the Clavaria, fasten the jars 
and put aside to cool. 

These will keep all winter, and may be used as a pickle or 
on lettuce leaves with French dressing as a salad. 

CANTHARELLUS 

This group is distinguished by the form of gills, which are 
decurrent, forked, sometimes irregular; in some species look 
like veins. 



346 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Cantharellus cibarius is known to most persons as the '^chan- 
tarell," and is one of the best of the edible mushrooms. The 
entire mushroom, cap, gills and stem, is of a rich chrome yellow. 
When broken it has a faint odor of ripe peach. It grows in the 
woods, especially under hemlocks, generally in clusters of twos 
or threes. These are best stewed with cream. 

MORCHELLA (Morels or Cup-Fungi) 

These are different in shape from the ordinary mushrooms. 
The cap is cup shaped, the outside of which is covered with pits 
irregularly arranged. The Morchella esculenta is the one best 
known. It grows in orchards in the early spring. 

These mushrooms may be stewed, baked or panned, but are 
best stuffed. Remove the stems, wash and drain. Make a 
stuffing of fine bread crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper 
and chopped parsley and sufficient melted butter to moisten. 
Stuff the mushrooms ; stand them in a baking pan, add a table- 
spoonful of butter and a half cup of stock. Bake thirty minutes, 
dish and put into the pan in which they were cooked one cupful 
of strained tomatoes. Boil rapidly fifteen minutes, or until 
slightly thickened, and strain it over the mushrooms. Gar- 
nish with triangular pieces of toast, and send at once to the 
table. 

BEEFSTEAK (Fw^w/wa hepatica) 

This mushroom grows like a great red tongue on chestnut 
trees. It appears about August and continues until frost. The 
acid or sour taste makes them unpalatable alone, but as a sauce 
for beefsteak or for catsup they are excellent. 

BEEFSTEAK SAUCE 

Remove the soft upper skin and cut off the pores. Cut the 
mushrooms into strips. To each pound allow a tablespoonful 
of butter, a half cup of stock, a half teaspoonful of salt, a half 
teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet. Put all the ingredients with 
the mushrooms in the saucepan. Cover closely and stew slowly 
a half hour. Pour over a well broiled beefsteak, or serve with 
roasted mutton.

PUFF BALLS {Ly coper don) 

All puff balls are edible when young and fresh. The flesh must 
be white to the very centre. Do not use them if they have the 
slightest yellow tinge. 

The giant puff ball (Lycoperdon giganteum) is the largest 
species of the genus. I have seen this variety in Indiana and 
Iowa weighing from seven to nine pounds. 

PUFF BALLS a la POULETTE 

Pare the puff balls, cut them into slices, then into dice. Put 
them in a saucepan, allowing one tablespoonful of butter to each 
pint of blocks. Cover and stew gently fifteen minutes. Lift the 
Hd, and add a level teaspoonful of salt, a half saltspoonful of 
pepper, and again cover the saucepan. Beat the yolks of three 
eggs, add to them a half cup of cream. Add this to the sauce- 
pan; shake until smoking hot, but do not allow them to boil. 
Serve at once on toast. 

Puff balls, mild in flavor, may be cooked with Agaricus 
campestris in equal quantities ; the mixture improves the flavor 
of both. 

Puff balls are very good pared, cut into slices, seasoned and 
sauted in hot oil; they may also be broiled. 

BOLETUS 

This group contains a large number of varieties. They belong 
to the same genera as the beefsteak mushrooms. The spores 
are not borne on gills as in the common mushrooms, but in 
pores or tubes ; these pores give the under surface the appear- 
ance of a fine sponge. The flesh is soft and quickly decays. 

To cook cut off the thick stem close to the pores. Wash 
the caps and remove the pores. Dust the caps with salt and 
pepper, dip them in beaten tgg^ roll in bread crumbs, and fry 
in hot fat. Serve at once with tomato catsup.

MUSHROOM CATSUP 

Wash and slice two quarts of mushrooms. Put a layer in the 
bottom of a stone jar. Sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt, 
then another layer of mushrooms, another teaspoonful of salt, 
and so continue until the jar is full. Cover and stand aside 
over night. Next day drain the liquor from the mushrooms 
and chop them fine. Measure the liquor ; put it into a porcelain 
lined kettle and to each pint allow a saltspoonful of pepper, a 
blade of mace, two whole cloves, a teaspoonful of mustard 
seed, a saltspoonful of ground ginger, and two bay leaves. 
Boil five minutes; strain; add the mushrooms; boil again five 
minutes, take from the fire, add a half cup of port wine, bottle, 
cork and seal. 

TO DRY MUSHROOMS 

The Agaricus campestris, Lepiota procera, Russula and Can- 
tharelhis are among the best varieties for this purpose. Remove 
the stems ; do not wash, but string them on a long cord, using 
a darning or trussing needle. Hang them in the sun and wind, 
or over the kitchen range where the heat will be sufficient to 
thoroughly dry in a few hours. Put them away in a box lined 
with paper. Keep in a perfectly dry place. 

To cook, soak them in a little water or milk and cook them 
without draining. 

TO CAN MUSHROOMS 

Wash the mushrooms, remove the stems and pack the caps into 
glass jars, adjust the rubbers, put the lids on loosely, and stand 
the jars in a wash boiler, the bottom of which has been pro- 
tected with a rack. Surround the jars half way up with cold 
water. Cover the boiler, bring to boiling point, and boil con- 
tinuously one and a half hours. Fill two jars from a third. 
Screw on the tops, stand them back at once into the boiler, 
cover the boiler, cook twenty minutes longer, lift and when 
quite cold, give the tops another turn. 

For canning, select Agaricus cmnpestris, Russula, Lactarius 
deliciosus or Lepiota procera.

TO COOK GREEN PEAS 

The sweetness and flavor of green peas depend entirely upon, 
careful cooking. Shell and throw them into cold water for 
twenty minutes ; drain and put them into a kettle of boiling 
water. Add a level teaspoonful of salt to each half gallon of 
water used ; boil slowly in an uncovered kettle for twenty min- 
utes or until the peas are tender. Rapid boiling hardens the 
peas and removes the shell. Cooked below the boiling point 
they will lose their color and become water soaked. When 
done, drain, add to them an extra half teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of pepper, and to each quart a level tablespoonful 
of butter. Shake carefully so as not to break the peas, and turn 
at once into a vegetable dish. Thick sweet cream may be used 
in the place of butter.

spoonful of pepper and the peas. Stand over hot water for ten 
minutes and they are ready to serve. 

STEWED PEAS 

Shell and soak the peas in cold water ; put them into a saucepan, 
allowing to each quart of peas a pint of water, a half teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a teaspoonful of sugar; cover the kettle and 
simmer gently for a half hour, or until the peas are tender. 
Rub together a tablespoonful of butter and one of flour; add 
the water drained from the peas, stir until boiling, and add a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Turn the peas into a vegetable dish, 
pour over the sauce, garnish with triangular pieces of toast, 
and send at once to the table. 

PEA PATTIES 

These are usually served as a course or entree at dinner; they 
may follow the soup in the place of the fish course. 

Shell sufficient peas to make a pint. Soak them in cold 
water twenty minutes. Put them into a saucepan with one pint 
of boiling water, a half teaspoonful of salt and cook in an 
uncovered kettle for twenty minutes, or until they are tender. 
While they are cooking make small bread patties, using for 
each three thin slices of bread. Put these in the oven to toast. 
When the peas are tender, drain. Rub together a tablespoonful 
of butter and one of flour; add the water in which the peas 
were cooked, stir until boiling; take from the fire and add the 
yolks of two eggs beaten with two tablespoonfuls of cream. 
Stir over the fire just an instant, add a half teaspoonful of salt, 
a saltspoonful of pepper and the peas. Stand over hot water, 
do not boil or the sauce will curdle. When ready to serve fill 
each patty to the very top and send at once to the table.

MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 

TO COOK CANNED PEAS 



Canned peas may be served according to any of the foregoing 
rules. Open the can, turn the contents into a large sieve, put 
it under the spigot, or pour through them a quantity of cold 
water, until they are thoroughly washed. To serve plain, heat 
carefully over hot water; do not add water or they will fall to 
pieces and remain watery. 



YOUNG SWEET CORN 

Sugar or sweet corn is a variety of Zea Mays, used principally 
in America. It is palatable, contains but little nourishment, 
that mostly sugar, which is easily lost in the boiling. In fact, 
if the husks are removed, the sweetness is lost in a night, or 
if the ears are piled together one on top of the other for a few 
hours they heat, a slight fermentation takes place, changing the 
sugar, leaving the corn tasteless. It should be cooked immedi- 
ately after picking, if possible. 

To keep it over night do not husk, but spread the ears out 
on a cool cellar floor or in the bottom of a cave or vault, or in 
the refrigerator. 

TO BOIL 

Husk the corn, remove carefully the silk; throw the ears into 
a large kettle of boiling water; bring to boiling point quickly 
and boil five minutes. Remove at once from the water, place on 
a corn cloth or napkin, throw the corners over to prevent escape 
of steam, and send to the table. Corn cannot stand after boiling, 
it loses its color, flavor and becomes watery. 



CORN BOILED IN THE HUSKS 

Remove a few of the outer husks leaving the cob covered with 
two layers of the young light husks. Open these carefully at 
the top and remove every particle of the silk. Have ready a 
kettle of boiling water ; put in the corn and boil, after the water 
begins to boil, ten minutes. When done lift with a skimmer 




VEGETABLES 353 

and arrange the ears neatly on a corn platter. Do not remove 
the husks. The husks prevent the sweetness from being drawn 
out in the water and are quite easily removed at the table. 

It is rather unusual to give directions how to eat, but there 
is an art in eating corn. 

When the whole grains are eaten from the cob, the hulls 
being indestructible, prevent the digestion of the grain; for 
this reason many people are obliged to abstain from this palat- 
able and wholesome vegetable. 

To eat, score each row of grains right through the centre. 
Then spread the corn on the cob lightly with butter, dust it 
with salt, and with the teeth press out the centre of the grains, 
leaving the hulls on the cob. Fresh, carefully cooked corn, eaten 
in this way, will not produce indigestion. 

Corn holders are small wooden or silver handles which are 
pressed into the ends of cobs. There are also wire frames, sold 
under the name of corn holders. These are rather clumsy, but 
convenient. 



TO STEW CORN 

1 dozen ears of corn Yz cup of hot milk 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter i teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Cut each row of grains through the centre and with a dull knife 
press out the pulp. Put this pulp in a double boiler and cook 
continuously for thirty minutes, stirring frequently. When 
ready to serve, add the salt, butter, milk and pepper. Serve hot 
in an uncovered dish. 



STEWED CORN AND TOMATOES 

6 solid tomatoes i tablespoonful of onion juice 

I tablespoonful of butter 6 large ears of corn 
I teaspoonful of salt i saltspoonful of pepper 

Scald, peel the tomatoes, cut them into halves and press out 
the seeds, then cut them into pieces ; put them into a kettle with 



854 

the onion, salt and pepper, and stew slowly thirty minutes. 
Husk the corn, score down the centre of each row of grains, 
press out the pulp ; add it to the tomatoes, cook carefully twenty 
minutes longer, add the butter and serve. Watch carefully 
after adding the corn, as it will easily scorch. To give variety 
add four nice green pods of okra, cut in thin slices and cook 
with the tomatoes. 

SUCCOTASH 

Add a pint of carefully cooked young lima beans to each pint of 
stewed corn. 

TO WARM OVER COLD CORN 

Cold com left from dinner may be cut carefully from the cob, 
put into a double boiler with sufficient milk to partly cover ; cook 
until the milk is hot, then add butter, salt and pepper. 

CORN CHOWDER 

1 dozen ears of corn 4 good-sized potatoes 

2 medium-sized onions i pint of milk 

6 Bents' water crackers 3 tablespoonfuls of flour 

Yolk of one egg i tablespoonful of butter 

3/2 pint of boiling water 

Pare and cut the potatoes into dice ; peel and slice the onions ; 
score each row of grains of corn, press out the pulp. Put a 
layer of the potatoes in the bottom of a saucepan, then a layer 
of the onions, a layer of corn, a sprinkling of salt and pepper ; 
then another layer of potatoes, and so on until all the materials 
are used, having the last layer corn. Add the water, cover 
the kettle and cook slowly over a moderate fire for twenty min- 
utes. Rub the butter and flour together, add the milk, stir until 
boiling, and add it to the chowder. Stir the whole carefully 
without breaking the potatoes. Bring to boiling point, add the 
crackers, broken into bits, cover the kettle for five minutes. Beat 
the yolk of the tgg with two tablespoonfuls of cream, stir it in 
at the last moment. Serve in a soup tureen. 

Served as first course in place of soup. Or it may be served

TO DRY SWEET CORN 



357 



Select perfectly fresh corn, score each row of ears clown 
through the centre. Press out the pulp with a dull knife ; spread 
the pulp on wooden, granite or china plates and dry either in 
the hot sun or a moderate oven. When partly dry it may 
be transferred to boards. In this way a larger quantity may be 
put in a given space. When perfectly dry put into jars or tin 
boxes and keep in a dry, cool place. 

TO COOK DRY CORN 

Cover the corn with cold water, soak it over night; next day 
cook it in the water in which it was soaked until perfectly 
tender, about a half hour. Season with cream, salt and pepper. 

TO HULL CORN 

I pint of clear sifted wood ashes 2 quarts of cold soft water 
2 quarts of white corn 

Put the wood ashes and the water into a porcelain-lined kettle ; 
boil fifteen minutes and stand aside to cool. When cold drain 
off carefully the clear water; test the water by rubbing it 
between the thumb and finger ; if it feels slippery add sufficient 
cold water to just cover the corn. Wash out the kettle until 
perfectly free from ashes ; put in the corn and boil continuously 
until the hulls begin to crack ; then with a skimmer dip out the 
corn, throw it into a pan of cold water. Take a little at a time 
with the skimmer, put it in a coarse towel, cover with the other 
end of the towel and rub quickly until all the hulls are removed. 
Now wash the corn through three or four cold waters ; continue

TO COOK HULLED CORN 

Put the corn, hulled according to the preceding recipe, into a 
kettle of cold water, boil slowly until tender, about four hours. 
Drain ; add a quarter of a pound of butter, two tablespoonfuls

of salt, a half leaspoonful of pepper. Stir until very hot, and it 
is ready to serve. The butter may be omitted and a half pint of 
cream added. 

BEETS {Beta vulgaris, Linn.) 

The ordinary beet root contains almost as much sugar as the 
white sugar beet that is grown for the purpose of making sugar. 
When young and tender, red beets are easily cooked, palatable 
and fairly digestible. For winter use it is far better to can 
young beets than to attempt to cook the old ones. They are 
dense and difficult of digestion even when cooked for hours. 
Beets are used as succulent vegetables as an accompaniment 
to salt or fresh beef, boiled tongue, or they may be used as a 
garnish to potato salad ; or cold, slightly pickled, as an accom- 
paniment to cold meats. Beets are digested in the small intes- 
tines. 

The tops of young beets are boiled and served as greens. 
While they are without nourishment, they give variety to a 
spring diet, are palatable and good waste food.

BOILED BEETS 

Wash carefully, do not cut or scrape. If the skin is broken 
before cooking, the coloring matter, which is soluble in water, 
will be drawn out, leaving the beet tasteless and unsightly. 
Cook slowly in boiling water for one hour; when done drain, 
remove the skins and cut the beets into thin slices. Dust them 
lightly with salt and pepper ; dish, put in the centre a tablespoon- 
ful of butter and send at once to the table. Or serve with beet

lemon, one-half teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Add the beets ; stand over hot water for fifteen minutes or until 
the juice is colored, and serve at once. 

Left-over beets may be covered with vinegar and put aside 
to serve with salads or used as a garnish to cold meats. 

STEWED BEETS 

Peel the young beets ; cut them in quarter inch cubes ; put them 
into a stewing pan, cover them with boiling water, allowing a 
pint of these blocks to one pint of boiling water; cover and 
stew slowly for three-quarters of an hour; add to them a level 
teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in a half cup of cold water ; 
add a half teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and one 
rounding tablespoonful of butter; boil up once and send them 
to the table. These are exceedingly nice to serve at a pink 
lunch or dinner. 

BEETS WITH CREAM SAUCE 

For this dish, select sweet, white beets and boil as directed in 
the first recipe, without breaking the skin. When the beets are 
done, rub off the skins and cut them into dice. Turn them at 
once into a vegetable dish, cover with cream sauce and send to 
the table. 

TO COOK CANNED BEETS 

Heat over hot water and serve the same as young fresh beets. 

TO PICKLE BEETS 

I dozen new beets i teaspoonful of ginger 

I teaspoonful of whole mace 2 tablespoonfuls of grated horse- 

I quart of vinegar radish 

Boil the beets without breaking the skin : when done, if small, 
leave them whole ; if large cut them into slices, and put into glass 
jars. Heat the vinegar and spices in a porcelain-lined kettle; 



360 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

take from the fire, strain and add the horseradish and pour, 
while hot, over the beets. Cover and stand in a cool place. 
They are ready to use in twelve hours and will keep any length 
of time; or cover left-over beets with plain, cold vinegar. 



CAROB BEAN (Ceratonia siliqua, Linn.) 

The carob, or locust bean, is also called St. John's bread. The 
pod as well as the bean is used, and in countries where they are 
grown form an important article of diet for man and cattle. In 
this country, however, they are principally used as a sweetmeat 
by school children. While sugar is present in large quantities, 
they also contain a goodly amount of nitrogen. 



CAROB SOUFFLE 

54 pound of carob beans ^ pint of soft bread crumbs 
4 eggs 

Wash the pods, break them into inch lengths ; cover with cold 
water and soak over night. Next day cook them in the same 
water slowly for one and a half hours, until perfectly tender. 
Then chop very fine and press through a colander. Add the 
bread crumbs, mix, add the yolks of the eggs, stir over the fire 
until smoking hot ; fold in the well beaten whites ; turn into a 
baking dish and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. Serve 
with curry of chicken. Pass with it a dish of carefully boiled 
rice. 

MASHED CAROB OR CAROB JAM 

Wash and soak one pound of beans in cold water over night ; 
next morning cook in the same water for one and a half to 
two hours. Then press them through a colander, or put them 
through the meat grinder. Return this mixture to the fire, 
add a teaspoon ful of ground ginger, the juice of a lemon and 
cook slowly fifteen minutes longer. Serve as an accompani- 
ment to game, roasted hare, or curried vegetables.

The green or so-called succulent vegetables include many 
parts of plants, as shoots, leaves, stalks, stems and roots, and are 
valuable articles of food, not on account of the nutriment they 
contain, but for their succulent nature, the mineral salts they 
yield, and the flavor and variety they give to the daily bill of fare. 

The true succulent vegetables, as a rule, do not contain nitro- 
genous matter of the sort that aids in the building of the tissues 
and flesh. Green vegetables are bulk foods, which aid in keep- 
ing up the natural peristaltic movement of the intestines. For 
this reason also they should be served at least once a day, each 
of the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year. 

Many of these green vegetables contain materials physiolog- 
ically suited to our needs; better by far take iron as we find 
it in many of the ordinary green vegetables, than from a bottle. 
Persons who cut from their diet all succulent vegetables arc 
continuously taking pills to bring about the necessary natural 
conditions which would exist by the judicial and regular use of 
green vegetables. 

The object of cooking non-starchy vegetables is to soften the 
fibre and to render them more easy of digestion. Green vege- 
tables being very succulent easily part with their salts, and 
unless well cooked are unsightly as well as unpalatable, and 



362 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

common salt (chloride of sodium) does not in any way replace 
the mineral matter soaked and boiled from these vegetables. 
The common turnip, an admirable succulent vegetable, sightly, 
palatable and appetising if daintily cooked is, nine times out of 
ten, ruined in the cooking. Raw cabbage is digested in two 
hours and a half ; after it passes through the hands of the ordi- 
nary cook it requires five hours, which certainly upsets the true 
definition of cooking. Besides making the cabbage difficult of 
digestion, careless cooking fills the house with an odor which is 
not only unpleasant but nauseating. The water is drained down 
the sink and a coarse unsightly dish without food value is the 
result. Vegetables with an odor, as cabbage and onions, 
should always be put over to cook in boiling salted water and 
cooked in an uncovered vessel. 

Green vegetables lend themselves most easily to combinations 
of milk for the making of the so-called cream soups. The milk 
containing the needed nourishment is made palatable by the 
flavor of a few left-over vegetables. These soups are nitrogen- 
ous, easy of digestion and with whole wheat bread and butter 
form an admirable luncheon or supper dish for children. Save 
even a tablespoonful of vegetables that may be left from a meal ; 
to-morrow add them to the soup; or mash and use them as 
flavoring to the meat or fish sauces. Among the best cream 
soups are potato, cream of corn, cream of pea, cream of beet 
and tomato. Spinach, kale or onions may be saved and added 
to cream sauces for fish and poultry.

GLOBE OR FRENCH ARTICHOKES 

The artichoke (Cynara Scolymus, Linn.) a plant of the natural 
order of the CompositcF. The fleshy parts of the scales known 
as "choke," with prickly leaves around, constitute the portion 
used as food. In appearance these resemble the green cone of 
the pine tree, or a huge thistle. 

TO BOIL ARTICHOKES 

Strip off the outside leaves, neatly trim the base, then with a 
sharp knife cut the tops of the leaves down within two inches 
of the base, with a handle of a spoon scoop out the flowery por- 
tion in the centre. Tie the artichoke into a compact form with a 
strong string. Have ready a kettle of boiling water to which 
you have added two tablespoonfuls of salt and a tablespoonful 
of powdered charcoal, tied in a piece of cheesecloth. Put in the 
artichokes, boil rapidly for five minutes, then reduce the water 
to just below the boiling point ; cook for about an hour or until 
the leaves are tender. Lift the artichokes carefully with a 
skimmer; turn them upside down to drain. To serve arrange 
them in circles on a heated dish and pass with them sauce Hol- 
landaise. 

To eat, strip off the leaves, hold them with the fingers at the 
tip of the leaf; dip the soft portion in the sauce, and with the 
teeth sort of strip off the fleshy part. The centre of the leaf is 
tough, the outside tender ; the "choke" may be eaten with a fork. 

STUFFED ARTICHOKES 

6 artichokes i teaspoonful of onion juice 

j4 pint of cold cooked chicken 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 
I teaspoonful of salt 2 tablespoonfuls of olive oil 

I pint of strained tomato stock 

Prepare the artichokes as in preceding recipe. Boil them thirty 
minutes and drain. Put into a bowl finely chopped cold cooked 
chicken or mutton, add the salt, onion juice and pepper. Pour 



VEGETABLES 



365 



over the melted butter; mix and stuff this into the artichokes. 
Put the oil in a frying pan and when hot put in the artichokes ; 
turn them carefully until they are slightly browned all over the 
outside. Stand them in baking pan, add the strained tomato 
or stock, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of butter 
and a slice of onion. Bake slowly one hour, basting once or 
twice over the outside of the artichokes. When ready to serve 
remove the strings, arrange them in circles on a chop dish and 
strain over the sauce from the pan. In the centre of the dish 
place a large crouton, that has been dipped in egg and quickly 
fried. Place in the centre of the crouton a hatlet skewer gar- 
nished with mushrooms. 

Pine nuts or chopped almonds may be used in the place of 
meat. 

BAKED ARTICHOKES 

Prepare, boil and drain the artichokes; remove the strings. 
Wrap each with a thin slice of bacon and replace the string. 
Stand the artichokes in a baking pan, putting a thin slice of 
onion over the top of each. Put into the pan two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, two chopped shallots, six fresh mushrooms cut into 
quarters, a tablespoonful of parsley, and a half pint of stock; 
cover the pan and bake for thirty minutes, basting once or twice. 
Then remove the cover and bake the artichokes quickly for 
thirty minutes longer. When done arrange the artichokes on a 
round plate, removing the string and bacon. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of sauce Hollandaise in the centre of each and send at once 
to the table. 



CHOKES OR BOTTOMS 

In the American market artichokes are usually purchased 
canned ; the leaves are removed, and the bottoms or "chokes" 
only are used. These may be heated over boiling water and 
served with sauce Hollandaise; or used as a foundation for 
macedoine, served with either sauce Hollandaise or brown 
sauce. They are also frequently served under a mold of 
spinach.

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

(Helianthus tuber osus, Linn.) 

These are the tubers of the so-called Italian sunflower, which 
grows wild and abundantly in many parts of the United States 
and Canada. They do not contain starch and but a trace of 
sugar ; are fairly rich in carbo-hydrates of the gum series. They 
also contain inulin. Being free from starch they may be eaten 
uncooked; if properly cooked, however, they retain their crisp 
and tender conditions and are exceedingly palatable. They form 
one of the most important vegetables for diabetic patients. 



JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH CREAM 
SAUCE 

Scrape the artichokes and throw them at once into cold water 
to prevent discoloration. When ready to cook, cut in slices a 
half inch thick; put them into a saucepan, cover with boiling 
water and cook gently for about twenty minutes or until the 
artichokes can be easily pierced with a fork ; drain, turn them 
at once in a heated dish and cover them with cream sauce. If 
over cooked they lose their crispness and become heavy.

leaves, pour over the sauce vinaigrette, and send at once to the 
table. 

SAUCE 



I saltspoonful of salt 
I teaspoonful of water 
I tablespoonful of vinegar 



3 tablespoonfuls of olive oil 
Yz teaspoonful of onion juice

Dissolve the salt in the water, add all the other ingredients and 
beat well for five minutes. 

PICKLED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

Pare the artichokes, throw them at once into cold water; then 
put them whole into a kettle of boiling water and cook for thirty 
minutes. Strain and arrange them neatly in glass jars; to each 
jar allow a half pint of vinegar, one bay leaf, a good-sized 
onion, sliced, four whole cloves, and a good-sized blade of mace. 
Put the vinegar into a porcelain or granite kettle, add all the 
seasoning and bring to boiling point and pour over the arti- 
chokes ; add to each jar a tablespoonful of grated horseradish 
and a teaspoonful of mustard seed ; screw on the tops and stand 
away to cool. This will keep for about four weeks and will be 
ready for use in two days. Serve with cold meat or as a garnish 
to a lettuce salad. 



ASPARAGUS (Asparagus oMcinalis, Linn.) 

Asparagus belongs to the lily family. The plant is cultivated 
for the early shoots, which are in great favor both as a vegetable 
served hot, and cold as a salad. 

Asparagus contains an alkaloid known as asparagin, and 
while it has a decided action upon the kidneys its true merits 
or demerits are not known. 



368 ^ MRS. rorer's new cook book 

BOILED ASPARAGUS 

Trim and wash thoroughly a bundle of asparagus ; cut from the 
butt ends the woody, hard portion, then pare off the outside 
skin nearly up to the head; tie again into smaller bundles, put 
these perfectly straight into a kettle of boiling water; add a 
teaspoonful of salt, boil for thirty minutes. While the asparagus 
is boiling, rub together a tablespoonf ul of butter and one of flour 
and toast four slices of bread. Trim off the crusts and cut the 
slices into halves ; arrange them neatly on a heated platter ; lift 
the asparagus and put it to drain on a flat plate. Add to the 
butter and flour a half-pint of the water in which the aspara- 
gus was boiled, stir constantly until boiling; add a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and the juice of 
half a lemon. Now stir in carefully another tablespoonful of 
butter, cut into bits. Arrange the asparagus on the toast, 
heads all one way; strain over the sauce and send at once to 
the table. 

ASPARAGUS TIPS 

1 bundle of asparagus i teaspoonful of salt 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter i saltspoonful of pepper 

Cut the tips, in two inch lengths, from the asparagus. Wash 
them and cut each piece into three. Cover with boiling water, 
add the salt, and boil a half hour. Drain ; add butter and pepper, 
and serve with squabs or broiled chicken. Save the remaining 
asparagus for soup. 

STEWED ASPARAGUS 

Wash, peel and cut into inch lengths one bundle of asparagus. 
Put these into a saucepan and cover with boiling water, add a 
teaspoonful of salt and boil thirty minutes. Drain in a colander ; 
when thoroughly drained return them to the kettle; dust over 
the asparagus one tablespoonful of flour, shake the kettle so 
that each piece will receive a portion of the flour, but not one 
piece must be pasty. Pour over one-half pint of cream, or add 
a tablespoonful of butter and a half pint of milk; season with

a level teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper ; bring care- 
fully to boiling point, turn in a heated vegetable dish and send 
at once to the table. This dish may be garnished over the top 
with croutons, or around the edge with triangular pieces of toast. 



ASPARAGUS IN A BREAD BOAT 

I bundle of asparagus i stale loaf of Vienna bread 

I pint of milk Yolks of four eggs 

I tablespoonful of butter i level teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Wash the asparagus and cut into lengths of half an inch, using 
the very tender portion only; save the butts for soup. Throw 
the tender parts into boiling water ; add a teaspoonful of salt 
and boil twenty minutes ; drain in a colander. Whittle the crust 
off the bread, and cut the loaf the shape of a boat, hollowing out 
the centre sufficiently large to hold the asparagus ; brush it over 
quickly with melted butter and brown in the oven. Put the milk 
into a double boiler; beat the yolks of the eggs, add to them 
slowly the hot milk, return them to the boiler and cook just a 
moment until slightly thick ; take from the fire and add, cut into 
pieces, the butter, and the salt and pepper ; put the aspara- 
gus into the boat and pour over the sauce; arrange it on a 
narrow platter and send at once to the table. To serve, cut 
through the boat, helping a slice of the boat with the asparagus 
and sauce. 



ASPARAGUS a la HOLLANDAISE 

Wash and tie into bundles and boil the asparagus ; when done 
drain, put on a platter and stand aside to cool. Serve very cold 
and pass with it hot sauce Hollandaise. To eat, lift each piece by 
the butt, with the fingers, dip the head in the sauce and lift it to 
the mouth. Eat only the tender portion. 

Asparagus may also be served plain boiled and cold with 
French dressing,

2 tablespoon fuls of butter Yz pint of bread crumbs 
2 tablespoonfuls of flour 4 eggs 

I pint of milk 

Trim and boil the asparagus for twenty minutes ; hard boil the 
eggs, remove the shells and chop them fine. Rub the butter and 
flour together, add the milk, stir until boiling and add the salt 
and pepper. Mix the eggs with the sauce. Cut the asparagus 
into lengths of one inch, put a layer of asparagus in the bottom 
of a baking dish, then a layer of sauce, then a sprinkling of 
bread crumbs, and so continue, having the last layer of crumbs. 
Bake in a quick oven until a golden brown, about twenty min- 
utes. This may be served as a supper dish to take the place of 
meat and vegetables, or as a second course at lunch or dinner. 
Left-over boiled asparagus may be used with French dress- 
ing as a salad. 

CABBAGE TRIBE 

Under this heading will be considered all the varieties of the 
single species (Brassica oleracea, Linn.) a most variable plant 
belonging to the Mustard Family. By selection and cultivation 
the whole cabbage tribe has been evolved from one plant. All 
of these plants contain a volatile oil, rich in hydrogen and sul- 
phur, which is driven off by careless cooking. The odor is 
unpleasant and particularly penetrating; in fact, badly cooked 
cabbage may be traced by this odor to the house a square away. 
Such cabbage is not only difficult of digestion but has lost its 
color and flavor, and is really unfit for food. Carefully boiled 
cabbage is delicate, quite easy of digestion, and is white and 
sightly. 

Plants belonging to this family, Hke all green vegetables, 
should be cooked in salted boiling water in an uncovered vessel. 

HEAD CABBAGE 

In this plant the leaves have by cultivation been crowded into a 
large dense head. 

Cabbage is a waste food, principally digested in the intes- 



VEGETABLES 



371 



tines, more easily digested raw than boiled ; if carefully cooked 
in salted water it is, however, quite as readily digested as when 
raw. Finely shredded, with French dressing, it makes an 
admirable dinner salad. The head of a "winter" cabbage being 
very dense, excludes the sun and the cabbage is said to be 
bleached and tender. 

BOILED CABBAGE 

Trim off the outside leaves, cut the cabbage into halves and if 
the head is large, again into quarters. Soak in cold water for 
one hour; do not add salt; then shake the cabbage and put it 
into a kettle of boiling water, being careful to have sufficient 
water to thoroughly cover the cabbage; add a teaspoonful of 
salt, bring to boiling point and boil slowly until the cabbage is 
tender and perfectly white, about three-quarters of an hour. If 
the head is large and cut only into halves, one to one and a 
quarter hours will be required to make it tender ; be very care- 
ful that the cabbage does not lose its color; as soon as it 
becomes slightly pink it is indigestible and never fit for food. 
When done drain carefully and serve as a garnish to boiled 
beef. Or cover with cream sauce and use as a vegetable. 

LADIES' CABBAGE 

Cut a small compact head of cabbage into eighths ; throw it into 
cold water for one hour. Shake, put into a kettle and cover with 
boiling water ; add a teaspoonful of salt, bring to boiling point 
and cook uncovered for thirty minutes. Lift each piece carefully 
with a skimmer ; when drained arrange in circular form on a 
round plate. Run together two tablespoonfuls of butter and 
two of flour ; add a pint of milk ; stir until boiling, add a level 
teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper ; strain this care- 
fully over the cabbage and send at once to the table. 

STEWED CABBAGE 

Chop rather fine sufficient cabbage to make two quarts ; put this 
into a stewing pan with sufficient boiling water to cover; add a 
teaspoonful of salt, bring to boiling point and boil slowly uncov- 



372 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

ered for twenty minutes ; drain in a colander ; when perfectly dry 
turn it back into the saucepan ; dust over, stirring constantly, one 
rounding tablespoonful of flour, a tablespoonful of butter, a half 
teaspoonful of salt, saltspoonful of pepper ; stir this over the fire 
for a moment and then add a half cup of milk. If you have 
cream omit the butter and add a half cup of cream. When this 
reaches the boiling point stand over hot water for ten minutes 
and serve. This is one of the most delicious of all vegetables. 

SCALLOPED CABBAGE 

Boil the cabbage as directed in preceding recipe. Make a half 
pint of cream sauce. Spread a layer of cabbage in the bottom 
of a baking dish, cover it with a layer of cream sauce and a 
goodly sprinkling of chopped cheese, about two tablespoonfuls ; 
then another layer of cabbage, and so continue until the mate- 
rials are used, having the last layer cheese. Over the top of this 
sprinkle four tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs. Bake in a quick 
oven twenty minutes. Serve in the dish in which it was baked. 

CABBAGE, RUSSIAN FASHION 

Cut a head of cabbage into halves and shave it down as you

Select a soft, loose head of cabbage, or a head of savoy ; throw 
into boiling water ; cover and stand until the leaves are wilted ; 
Drain carefully, remove the leaves and cut out the heavy mid- 
rib. Have ready cold meat chopped fine; add the salt, pepper 
and onion ; put a cabbage leaf down on a board, put a table- 
spoonful of the mixture in the centre; fold in the sides of the 
leaf and roll it up. Put it down into the saucepan, placing it in 
a position to prevent the unrolling. Make another roll and 
put it closely by the side of the first one, and so continue until 
you have the desired quantity. Squeeze over the top the juice 
of the lemon or a tablespoonful of vinegar, and add sufficient 
boiling water to cover. vStand over a moderate fire and cook 
slowly for twenty minutes. Drain carefully and turn out the rolls 
on a platter. Rub together the butter and flour, add the water, 
which should measure now one pint, in which the rolls were 
cooked; stir until boiling; take from the fire; add the yolks of 
the eggs slightly beaten ; strain this over the rolls and send at 
once to the table. 

Served with rice balls this dish will take the place of meat 
and vegetables.

By slightly changing the recipe one may make a dozen 
different dishes ; for instance, add a few chopped nuts to the 
meat ; or use a cup of chopped meat and a cup of boiled rice ; 
season with curry. Or mix the meat with bread crumbs, and 
instead of using the water in which the rolls are boiled for the 
sauce, serve with tomato sauce. 

Served as the vegetable course at a dinner or as the main 
course at the family lunch or as a supper dish, these are good, 
wholesome and sightly.

Cut and soak the cabbage as in preceding recipe. Put the vine- 
gar into a saucepan, bringing to boiling point; beat the eggs 
without separating until light ; add the thick sour cream ; add 
this to the vinegar, add the butter and stir until the mixture 
thickens ; take from the fire, add the salt and pepper. Drain the 
cabbage, shake it dry ; cover w^ith the hot sauce, mix and stand 
aside to cool. Serve cold. 



TO MAKE SAUERKRAUT 

Select large hard white heads of cabbage ; shred them very fine. 
Line the bottom and sides of a clean keg or barrel with the out- 
side cabbage leaves. Put in the bottom a layer of shredded 
cabbage three inches deep, sprinkle over four ounces of salt, 
and with a wooden pestle pound it down. Put in another layer 
of cabbage and four ounces of salt, and so continue until the 
keg is full; put on the top a round board about two inches 
smaller than the keg, and on this a heavy weight. A good 
sized stone carefully washed and scrubbed will answer. Allow 
this to stand in a warm place to ferment. When fermentation 
begins, the cabbage sinks and the liquid will come to the sur- 
face ; skim off the scum ; cover the top of the keg and put it in 
a cool, dry cellar. The sauerkraut will be ready to use in about 
two weeks ; each time you remove the lid, be careful to replace it. 



TO COOK SAUERKRAUT 

Wash the sauerkraut thoroughly through several waters ; throw 
it into a kettle of boiling water ; cook slowly uncovered until it 
is tender, about one hour. Drain and serve as a garnish to

RED CABBAGE 

Red cabbage forms into hard heads the same as white cabbage ; 
it is not, however, so delicate or valuable, as the coloring matter 
fades in the cooking. It is used principally for pickling, 
although the Germans make it into one or two very palatable 
dishes.

Trim and soak the head in cold water for one hour. Cut it into 
halves, then into shreds, removing the core. Put the butter 
into a saucepan, when hot add the onion and cook slowly until 
brown, or better until the onion is soft. Then add the cabbage, 
cover the saucepan and let it stand on the back part of the stove 
for twenty minutes. Add the salt and pepper and cook again 
for ten minutes, or until the cabbage is tender. This slow cook- 
ing will steam the cabbage, removing the necessity of adding 
water. Add the vinegar and claret, and cook rapidly for fifteen 
minutes, stirring or tossing the cabbage with a fork or wooden 
spoon. Serve at once with roasted goose, duck or boiled beef.

roasted or boiled salt pork or corned beef. 



SAVOY 

Savoy (Borecole), a variety of common cabbage with a loose 
head composed of very curly or wrinkled leaves. It is rather 
more delicate than the ordinary cabbage and is essentially a 
fall or early winter cabbage. After the head is scalded and 
opened it looks very much like a huge rose; the leaves never 
become white or bleached. On account of the looseness of the 
head it is usually served stuffed with other materials. The 
separate leaves are used with Egyptian rolls, a little roll of 
lentils and rice.

other ingredients, adding the onion, grated. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of this mixture into the centre of a loaf, fold in the sides 
and then roll it up ; form a roll about three inches long and the 
size of the finger. Put these down carefully into a saucepan,

carefully into the well beaten yolks of four eggs. Cook over 
hot water until the consistency of mayonnaise dressing. There 
should be not more than one and a half cups of water. Take 
from the fire, add a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar and a 
half teaspoonful of salt. Dish the rolls in the centre of a deep 
dish ; strain over the sauce and send them at once to the table. 
Serve these with any delicate meat, or they may take the place 
of meat for luncheon or supper, or they may be served as an 
entree at dinner. 

If they are packed to cook in a small round saucepan, and 
the water carefully drained away, they will retain the shape of 
the vessel, and if carefully turned out will keep this form. Pour 
the sauce around, and garnish the edge with triangular pieces 
of toast.

over the centre leaves, around these put a layer of the mixture, 
fold over the next row of leaves, and so continue until you have 
a thin layer of stuffing between each row of leaves. Tie the 
head compactly in a piece of cheesecloth, put it in salted, boiling 
water in an uncovered vessel and boil one hour. Lift the cloth, 
drain the cabbage carefully, turn it into a round dish and cover 
with white or cream sauce ; du.^t with chopped parsley. Serve 
as the main dish at a family dinner or lunch, or it may be 
served as an entree at dinner. A dish of this kind is preferable 
served alone.

CAULIFLOWER 

Cauliflower and broccoli have all the nutritious matter concen- 
trated in a short, compact bunch of flowers formed into a soft 
head. Broccoli is both white and purple, but the name is usually 
applied to the loose heads of cauliflower. Broccoli is more hardy 
than cauliflower and is said to be rather more easily digested. 
Both may be prepared and served according to the same rules. 
Broccoli with chicken stock is frequently made into mock 
bisque soup. The brilliant pink makes it a desirable soup for 
pink luncheons or dinners. Both cauliflower and broccoli are 
more delicate and easily digested than common cabbage. 

BOILED CAULIFLOWER 

Trim oflf the outside leaves, throw the head in cold water and 
soak for a half hour; tie in a square of cheesecloth, drop it 
stem side down into a large kettle of boiling salted water ; boil 
slowly uncovered for twenty or thirty minutes, according to the 
size of the head. Be very careful not to overcook the cauli- 
flower, as it will become watersoaked and lose its flavor and 
color. When done lift carefully and drain ; dish and pour over 
either cream sauce, sauce Hollandaise, or English drawn butter. 
Cauliflower may be simply boiled, garnished with parsley or 
capers, and served cold with French dressing.

head into little flowerets, arrange them in a baking dish, 
sprinkle over four tablespoonfuls of Parmesan or any grated 
cheese, cover with a half pint of cream sauce, dust thickly with 
bread crumbs and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. Serve

Cook quickly, stirring all the while until the materials are thor- 
oughly browned. Spread this over the top of the cauliflower 
and send at once to the table. 



KALE 

Kale is distinguished from savoy by the abundance of chloro- 
phyll, the green coloring matter of the leaves, and the short 
stem from which the leaves spring. Kale is the least nutritious 
of all the cabbage tribe. It contains very little vegetable acid 
and flavoring substance; it forms, however, one of the most 
agreeable and best of the spring greens. We have two varie- 
ties, blue and green ; both are prepared precisely the same. Kale 
is sold in New York markets under the name of **sprouts." 
This is rather misleading, as this term is applied in general to 
Brussels sprouts. 



382 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

BOILED KALE 

Wash carefully one-half peck of kale ; pick the leaves from the 
stalks, wash them again, shake them up and down in the water 
rather than drain the water from them. The leaves are very 
liable to contain sand, which, being heavy, falls to the bottom 
of the pan. After the kale is drained and cleaned, throw into a 
large kettle; add a pint of boiling water; sprinkle over a tea- 
spoonful of salt, cover the kettle; stand over a moderate fire 
where the kale will steam slowly for three-quarters of an hour. 
Stir three or four times. Drain in a colander, and when dry 
chop fine; return to the saucepan; add two tablespoonfuls of 
cream, one tablespoon ful of butter, a level teaspoonful of salt 
and a saltspoonful of pepper ; stir constantly over the fire until 
the mixture is hot. Turn the mixture into a small bowl and 
pack it down simply to shape it. Turn out carefully on a round, 
heated dish. Garnish with triangular pieces of toast and hard 
boiled eggs. 

Kale may also be boiled with salt pork or corned beef and 
served as a garnish to the same, or it may be chopped fine and 
served cold with French dressing garnished with hard boiled 
eggs. 



KALE, ASPARAGUS FASHION 

Wash the leaves and tie them into bundles; throw them into 
boiling salted water and boil rapidly in an uncovered kettle for 
a half hour. Lift each bunch and drain it carefully; arrange 
them neatly on a platter, the bottom of which has been covered 
with toasted bread. Remove the strings from the bundles with- 
out breaking them. Rub together a tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour, add a half pint of the water in which the kale was 
boiled, stir until boiling ; take from the fire, add a half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and the juice of half a 
lemon ; then add slowly another tablespoonful of butter. Strain 
this over the kale and send at once to the table. Serve with 
roasted beef or veal, pork, duck or goose.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

These are composed of numerous small heads growing in the 
axils of the leaves on a long stem below the top leaves, and 
are perhaps the most delicate of all the cabbage tribe; in fact, 
it has been said that Brussels sprouts are cabbages with a col- 
lege education. To be perfect they should not be larger than 
an English walnut. 

TO BOIL SPROUTS 

Trim neatly and throw them into cold water to soak for one 
hour; put them in salted boiling water and cook just below the 
boiling point, in an uncovered vessel, until tender, about 
thirty minutes. If they lose their color and turn a sort of 
yellowish green they have been cooked too long. They must 
be a brilliant green, tender and delicate. When done drain 
them in a colander, turn in a heated dish, cover with cream 
sauce, sauce Hollandaise or plain melted butter. Serve with 
roasted beef, turkey, chicken, duck or goose.

milk ; add a half teaspoonful of salt and the pepper. Dish the 
sprouts, pour over the cream sauce and send at once to the 
table. 

SPROUTS WITH MELTED BUTTER 

Wash and cook the sprouts according to the preceding recipe ; 
turn into a heated dish and pour over two tablespoonfuls of 
carefully melted butter.

COLLARDS 

Collards are a cabbage in which the fleshy leaves do not form a 
head, but are scattered on a long stem. This variety of cab- 
bage is grown principally in the southern part of the United 
States. Collards may be coc4ced and served according lo the 
rules for cooking spinach or kale. 

KOHL-RABI 

Kohl-rabi, or turnip cabbage, as it is sometimes called, stores 
nourishment just above the ground in a turnip-like swelling 
of the stem from which the leaves spring. Being free from 
starch it may be pared, sliced and served raw in place of rad- 
ishes. Or it may be cooked and served according to the rules 
for cooking turnips. It is slightly more nutritious than the 
common white turnips. Plain boiled with cream sauce it gives 
a delightful, succulent fall vegetable. It is also nice in salad. 

KOHL-RABI WITH SAUCE HOLLANDAISE 

Remove the leaves and cut a thick paring from the outside, 
removing all the woody portion. Cut the flesh into slices a 
half inch thick. Throw them into boiling, salted water, boil 
rapidly in an uncovered vessel for thirty minutes. Drain, turn 
into a heated vegetable dish and cover with sauce Hollandaise. 
Kohl-rabi is also palatable boiled and served with cream sauce. 

CARDOON (Cynara Carduncuhis, Linn.) 

This plant resembles the artichoke; the edible portion, how- 
ever, consists of the thick, fleshy leaf stalks and midribs 
bleached. The bleaching is done by tying up the leaves, wrap- 
ping all but the top to exclude the sun. 

These are boiled in salted water and served the same as 
asparagus, with cream sauce or sauce Hollandaise. 

The term ''Chard" is applied to the leaf stalks and midrib 
of the globe artichoke, which are tied and bleached in the same 
manner as cardoons. These are also boiled and served with 
sauce Hollandaise,

CARROTS (Daucus Carota, Linn.) 

As a result of cultivation this root has grown fleshy, succulent, 
and of a light yellow or pale orange color. When young and 
fresh it is sweet, tender and agreeable; but becomes hard and 
strong when old. Carrots cut into thin slices and roasted are 
used as a coffee substitute or '"extract" in this country and in 
many parts of Germany. When roasted and boiled with water 
they yield a yellow liquid used as butter coloring. Full grown 
or mature carrots are quite rich in sugar and contain some 
starch. The young succulent roots, however, contain but little 
more than water and mineral matter. They have a trace of iron 
and are said to be anti-scorbutic. 



STEWED CARROTS 

Scrub and cut into dice sufficient carrots to make a pint ; throw 
them into cold water for thirty minutes, drain and put them into 
a kettle of boiling water ; cook uncovered just below the boiling 
point for three-quarters of an hour, or until the carrots are. 
tender, and drain again. Put one tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour into a saucepan, mix ; add a half pint of good stock, 
stir until boiling, add the carrots, a half teaspoonful of salt, 
a saltspoonful of pepper and they are ready to serve.

Do not boil the sauce after adding the yolks. 

CARROTS IN TURNIP CUPS 

Pare small, well shaped white turnips. Cut slices from the 
stem end and with a potato scoop, scoop out the flesh, leaving a 
cup. Throw these into unsalted boiling water and simmer for 
twenty minutes. Lift each one carefully with the skimmer and 
turn upside down to drain. While these are cooking, cut young 
carrots into dice, put them in a kettle of boiling water and 
cook below the boiling point for twenty minutes; drain in a 
colander. Arrange the turnip cups while hot on a heated chop 
dish ; add to the carrots half a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful 
of pepper and a half cup of good thick cream. Shake over the 
fire until hot and fill in the turnip cups ; garnish the dish with 
parsley and send at once to the table. 

This is an exceedingly sightly dish to serve in the spring at 
a small dinner or lunch. 

PICKLED CARROTS 

Scrape, wash in cold water, six good-sized carrots, cut them 
into slices crosswise, put them into a kettle of boiling water and 
cook until tender, about three-q^uarters of an hour, keeping the 
water just below the boiling point. Drain, put them into jars, 
add a slice of onion, two bay leaves, a teaspoonful of celery 
seed ; fill the jars with vinegar and stand aside for twenty- four 
hours and they are ready to use. 

These make a sightly garnish for lettuce salad, or may be 
used in potato salad, or as garnish for cold meat.

gular pieces of toasted bread. 

CELERY (Apium graveolens, Linn.) 

Celery has by cultivation lost its acrid taste, and become sweet 
and mild. To make it still more agreeable, the gardener banks 
the earth around the stalks as they grow until all but the tops 
are covered ; in this way the sun is excluded and the stems are 
bleached, succulent and tender. As soon as celery comes home 
from the market or is brought into the house, cut off the green 
tops and put them aside for soup flavoring ; separate the heads, 
saving the outside green pieces for stewing or celery sauce, 
and the very tender inner portion for eating raw. 

Celery will keep much longer if the stalks are placed in a 
deep jar of cold water. The very large varieties are best for 
stewing; for eating raw, the small inferior looking heads are 
usually the sweetest. 

A five cent scrubbing brush will enable one to clean celery 
quickly and carefully. 

TO PREPARE CELERY, RAW 

After thoroughly scrubbing and washing the celery throw it 
into cold water to soak for thirty or forty minutes. Serve with 
cracked ice in a shallow celery dish. 

TO FRINGE CELERY 

Cut nice crisp celery into two inch lengths ; with a sharp knife 
begin at the outside of the stalk, make six or eight cuts about 
one inch in length, then about five parallel cuts, and cut the 
other end of the piece in the same manner. Throw at once into 
cold water. In about one hour these little pieces will curl back, 
giving the celery the appearance of being fringed. 

To serve as raw celery cut only one end of each piece ; for 
garnishing fringe both ends.

STEWED CELERY 

I quart of celery I tablespoonful of flour 

I tablespoonful of butter Yz teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Use the outside pieces that are not sufficiently white and tender 
to be served raw. Wash carefully, cut into lengths of one inch, 
cover with boiling salted water and cook just below the boiling 
point, about 210° Fahr., for thirty minutes. Drain, saving the 
water. Rub together the butter and flour, add a half pint of the 
water in which the celery was boiled, stir until boiling, add the 
salt and pepper. Strain this over the celery, and cook slowly 
live minutes longer. Serve with turkey or chicken, or tame 
duck. 

CREAMED CELERY 

Cook the celery the same as in preceding recipe ; save the water 
in which it was cooked for cream soup. When the celery is 
tender, make plain cream sauce, add to it the celery and, when 
thoroughly hot, serve. 

BOILED CELERY 

Cut off the tops and the outside very green pieces and neatly 
trim the root without breaking the head. Wash carefully, allow- 
ing the water to penetrate the very heart ; tie the heads to keep 
them in shape ; throw them into boiling water, add a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and cook gently one hour. When done lift the 
bundles and drain carefully. Cut the strings, and arrange the 
heads neatly on a platter. Serve a half head to each person, 
cutting lengthwise of the head. Pass sauce Hollandaise. 

SAUTED CELERY 

Select six small, solid stalks of celery ; wash, cut them into 
lengths of one and a half to two inches ; soak them in cold 
water for half an hour, throw them into boiling water; add a 
teaspoonful of salt, and boil rapidly five minutes; drain again. 



390 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Throw them onto a napkin or towel, and toss them about 
until thoroughly dry. Put two tablespoonfuls of oil into a shal- 
low frying or saute pan ; add a tablespoonful of chopped onion, 
and when hot, put in the celery, a small quantity at a time ; stir 
or toss over a very hot fire until slightly browned ; lift with a 
skimmer, and drain on brown paper. When ready to serve 
sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of soy or mushroom catsup, 
and send at once to the table. This is served as an accompani- 
ment to panned or broiled chicken. 

CELERY au SUPREME 

2 heads of celery 2 tablespoonfuls of flour

Cut the celery into one inch pieces ; wash thoroughly, cover with 
a quart of water, add the salt and cook gently three-quarters 
of an hour. Rub the butter and flour together, add one pint 
of water in which the celery was boiled, stir until boiHng, take 
from the fire, add tlie celery drained, the yolks of the eggs 
beaten with a quarter cup of cream, and the pepper, and stir 
over hot water until it is the thickness of good cream. Be 
careful not to boil or the sauce will curdle. 

DIPPED CELERY 

Cut tender white celery into four inch lengths. Wash, dry, and 
dust with salt and pepper. Dip them in beaten egg, roll in fine 
bread crumbs, and plunge them for a moment into hot fat. 
Serve as a garnish to boiled fowl. 

CELERIAC (Apium graveolens, Variety Rapaceum) 

Celeriac, or turnip rooted celery, is a variety of the common 
white celery of which the root is enlarged and edible — not the 
stalks, as in the common celery. These roots are peeled, sliced, 
boiled and served cold with mayonnaise dressing under the 
name of celery root salad.

CELERIAC WITH CREAM SAUCE 

Peel the roots, cut them into slices one inch thick ; throw them 
into cold water to soak for a half hour ; drain, cover with boiling 
water, add a level teaspoonful of salt; boil for three-quarters 
of an hour, or until tender. Drain, saving the water in which 
they were boiled for soups or sauces. Dish the celery root and 
pour over cream sauce. 

CELERY ROOT WITH SAUCE HOLLANDAISE 

Boil according to the preceding recipe ; when done and tender, 
drain, turn into a heated vegetable dish and pass with it sauce 
Hollandaise. 

SCALLOPED CELERY ROOT 

Peel and boil the celery root as directed in the first recipe. 
When done drain and chop it fine ; measure it, and to each pint 
allow a half pint of white or cream sauce. Put a layer of the 
cream sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, then a layer of the 
chopped celery root, then another layer of cream sauce, and so 
continue until the dish is full, having the last layer sauce. Dust 
the top lightly with grated cheese, then with bread crumbs and 
bake in a moderately quick oven thirty minutes. Serve in the 
dish in which it was baked. 

Serve celery and celeriac with poultry. 



CUCUMBERS (Cucumis sativus, Linn.) 

Cucumbers are rich in water, and contain but little mineral 
matter; they are chiefly prized for their agreeable odor and 
flavor. Cooked they form an attractive and easily digested 
succulent vegetable. In Egypt, they are cooked in many 
attractive ways and are served daily in every household. As 
a preserve they form the common sweetmeat. Stuffed with 
crumbs and chopped nuts, they take the place of meat. 

Cucumbers when served raw are dense and difficult of diges- 
tion ; if sliced and soaked in salted water they lose their crisp- 
ness, become leathery and even dangerous to persons of weak 
stomach. Always soak them in clear, cold water. 



392 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

TO DRESS CUCUMBERS RAW 

Throw the cucumbers into cold water, soak for fifteen or twenty 
minutes; pare, cut them into very thin sHces, cover with fresh 
cold water and soak one hour. When ready to serve, drain, 
turn into a salad dish or bowl and at the last moment cover them 
with French dressing. 

In the early spring, when cucumbers are very expensive, it 
is wise to pass the dressing after serving the cucumbers. When 
once covered with French dressing they cannot be saved, as 
standing in the vinegar toughens the fibre and makes them 
^.bsolutely indigestible. 

CUCUMBERS a la POULETTE 

3 good-sized cucumbers i tablespoonful of flour 

Juice of half a lemon i saltspoonful of salt 

I tablespoonful of butter i saltspoonful of pepper

Pare the cucumbers, cut them into halves, and with a spoon 
scoop out the seeds. Cut each half into three pieces, crosswise. 
Put them into a piece of cheesecloth, tie loosely, drop them into 
a kettle of boiling salted water, cook at the boiling point for 
thirty-five to forty minutes, or until they are perfectly tender. 
Lift the cheesecloth, put it into a colander to drain. Rub 
together the butter and flour, add half of the water in which the 
cucumbers were cooked, stir until boiling, add the salt, pepper, 
and the yolks of the eggs, well beaten. Cook over the fire 
just a moment, being careful not to curdle; take from the fire 
and add the juice of the lemon. Turn the cucumbers into a 
shallow vegetable dish, strain over the sauce and send at once 
to the table.

VEGETABLE MARROW (Cucurbifa Ovifera, Linn.) 

These resemble long narrow cucumbers. When well cooked 
they form an excellent succulent vegetable. They are exten- 
sively cultivated in England, but little known in the United 
States. 

Cook and serve according to the rules for cucumbers. 



SUMMER SQUASH (CYMLIN) 

This belongs to the pumpkin tribe. In composition, however, 
it more closely resembles cucumbers and vegetable marrow. 
When carefully cooked, it forms a delicate, easily digested, suc- 
culent vegetable. Its nutritive value is low ; it simply gives 
variety to the daily bills of fare. It may be cooked and served 
according to recipes given for cucumbers. They are very 
nice stuffed and baked. Do not pare them for baking.

GHERKINS (Cucumis Anguria, Linn.) 

These are small prickly cucumbers used for pickling. 

MARTYNIA (Martynia prohoscidea, Clox.) 

These plants are grown for their curious fruits, which are used 
principally for pickling. Containing mucilage as they do, they 
are in many places substituted for okra. They may be cooked 
and served according to the rules for cooking okra; they are 
not, however, so palatable. 

EGG PLANT 

(Solanum melongena, Linn., Variety esculentum) 

In England the egg plant is called aubergines or brinjal. The 
large purple variety is best.

cup of bread crumbs, a half cup of chopped nuts, a teaspoonful 
of salt, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of 
summer savory, a saltspoonful of pepper, and a tablespoonful 
of grated onion ; mix all the ingredients, and stufif them into 
the egg plant, heaping it up in the centre. Stand these in a 
baking pan and bake in a moderate oven one hour, basting the

HORSERADISH (Nasturtium Arnwracia, Fries) 

The edible portion of this plant consists of the long tap root, 
which contains very much the same aromatic principles as the 
black mustard. This is usually grated, mixed with vinegar, 
and served as a condiment or sauce for cold meats, raw oysters 
or clams. Carefully cooked it is less pungent and much more 
palatable than raw, and is then served as an accompaniment to 
game.

This is also served with boiled salt beef. 

OKRA (Hibiscus esculentus, Linn.) 

The young pods constitute the edible portion of this plant. 
They are rich in mucilage and used principally for soups. The 
Creoles use them with corn and tomatoes as a stew, and with 
tomatoes alone as a sauce. They form the base of all varieties 
of gumbo. The famous Brunswick stew of Virginia is a sort 
of gumbo. Okra rhay be preserved for winter use by cutting 
them into rings, stringing them on cords and drying in the hot 
air ; or they may be canned the same as other vegetables. Okra 
is frequently called gumbo.

ONION {Allium Cepa, Linn.) 

The common onion consists of a large bulb containing very pun- 
gent flavoring due to a volatile oil rich in sulphur. This odor, 
like the odor of cabbage, is dissipated and thrown off by care- 
less cooking. Onions must be cooked in salted boiling water, 
in an uncovered vessel ; they are then wholesome, rather easy 
of digestion and stimulating to the intestines. 

Varieties differ in containing more or less volatile oil. The 
Spanish and Bermuda onions contain but little and are terme4 
"sweet," while our common ''brown skins" are very pungent. 

To keep for winter use, select a perfectly light, dry place 
where there is no danger of the onions freezing — they must be 
kept cold, but freezing causes immediate decay. Too warm 
a place causes sprouting. A temperature of 50° Fahr. is about 
right. 

BOILED ONIONS 

Peel the onions, carefully removing all the outside covering; 
wash them in cold water, throw them into boiling salted water 
and cook in an uncovered vessel just at the boiling point three- 
quarters of an hour, or until the onions are perfectly tender;

drain in a colander until perfectly free from water, return them 
to the saucepan, put them back over the fire, and stew slowly 
until dry, about fifteen minutes. Turn them into an uncov- 
ered vegetable dish and pour over cream sauce. 

If the onions are not thoroughly drained they will dilute 
the cream sauce, making it watery in the bottom of the dish. 

Serve onions with poultry ; always with roasted turkey. 



BOILED SPANISH ONIONS 

Peel one good-sized Spanish onion, cut it into slices a half inch 
thick; boil precisely the same as in preceding recipe. Serve

* equal quantity of cold cooked chicken, chopped fine, a saltspoon- 
ful of salt, and one of pepper; mix, and add four tablespoon- 
fuls of dry bread crumbs. Fill this into the onion, spreading 
it apart, that it may hold the entire mixture. Wrap it in wax 
paper, stand it in a baking dish, and bake in a moderate oven 
one hour. Remove the paper, dish on a round dish, and pour 
over brown or cream sauce. This is sufficient for six people. 

Serve as an accompaniment to roasted turkey, or it may be

Cold left-over onions may be chopped fine, mixed with 
cream sauce, turned into a baking dish, covered with bread 
crumbs, and browned in the oven; or they may be put aside 
as an addition to soups or sauces. 

BURNT ONIONS 

% pound of onions Va pound of sugar 

^ pint of water 

Put the sugar into an iron saucepan and stir until melted, not 
browned; add the onions and cook until they smoke and 
burn. Then add the water, stir and cook until the consist- 
ency of a thin syrup. Strain and put in a bottle. This will 
keep for months and is used for coloring soups and sauces. 

In burning, the sugar loses a large portion of its sweetness, 
that remaining is destroyed by the onion flavoring. 

LEEK {Allium Porrtim, Linn.) 

The bulb of the leek is greatly elongated, and the leaves broadly 
linear. They are used principally as flavoring for soups, but 
are sometimes boiled and served with cream sauce. 

The old and popular dish, cock-a-leekie, a chicken soup, is 
thickened with leeks. 



406 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

SCULLIONS OR SPRING ONIONS 

These in this country are frequently called leeks, but are differ- 
ent both in appearance and flavor. Spring onions are small 
onions grown from old mature onions, replanted ; they are 
usually served raw or as flavoring for salads. If the first out- 
side layer is taken off they may be boiled and served with cream 
sauce, the same as asparagus; or they may be substituted for 
leeks in cock-a-leekie. 

TOP OR TREE ONIONS 

By cultivation these are formed in small clusters of bulbs at the 
top of the stem, in the place of the flowers and seeds. They are 
the little white onions used for pickling. 

PEPPERS (CHILLIES) 

The very many diverse forms of "peppers" are obtained from 
the varieties of two or three species of the genus Capsicum, the 
commonest of which is Capsicum annuum, Linn. Tobasco and 
the best cayenne are made from the small yellow, red, very hot 
or pungent ''bird pepper." Paprika is made from a brilliant 
red, sweet chilli, dried and ground. This is used as a coloring 
and flavoring for sauces, soups and salads. 

The large sweet varieties, stuffed or stewed, form an agree- 
able succulent vegetable. The large hot chillies or "bell" 
peppers are used principally by the Mexicans as a base or 
flavoring for all made dishes, as tamales and chile-con-carne. 
They are used by Americans stuffed with cabbage, and pickled, 
as mangoes. 

Tobasco oil is made by soaking "bird peppers" in olive oil. 
It forms an exceedingly pleasant seasoning for cream sauce 
or salad dressings. Sweet chillies are canned or dried, for 
winter use. If dried they must be soaked in water before cook- 
ing. A very nice Spanish pepper, canned in oil, can be pur- 
chased at any first-class grocer's. These are used as a salad 
garnish, or as a seasoning for oysters or stewed chicken.

If the peppers are old and slightly withered, soak them for 
a half hour in cold water, then throw into boiHng water and 
boil fifteen minutes before stuffing. 



STEWED PEPPERS 

Cut the peppers into halves, remove the seeds and stems. Cut 
each pepper in four pieces lengthwise. Throw them into boil- 
ing salted water and cook at boiHng point for thirty minutes. 
Drain perfectly dry; add a tablespoonful of butter, a half tea-

RADISH (Raphanus sativtis, Linn.) 

Radishes contain neither sugar nor starch and are as a rule 
served raw as appetizers. They are passed with the soup at 
dinner and are frequently served for breakfast or lunch, passed 
at the early part of the meal. Being dense, they are rather diffi- 
cult of digestion, and do not contain nourishment. Many 
varieties are cultivated, and v^hen young, tender and full grown, 
are crisp and palatable. They should never be eaten when old 
or pithy; in this condition they frequently produce acute indi- 
gestion. 

The small red button radishes should not be peeled or pared ; 
the skin aids in the digestion of the radish. The tiny green seed 
pods are pickled and used as a garnish for salads and are one 
of the ingredients of mixed pickles. 

The large Japanese and the solid black Spanish radishes arc 
grown for winter use. If covered with sand in a cool cellar they 
will keep in good condition until spring. They may be served 
either raw or cooked, and if properly kept give variety to the 
winter dinner. Containing neither starch nor sugar, they may, 
when cooked, be added to the list of diabetic foods. Prepare 
and cook according to the recipes given for turnips. 

TO SERVE RADISHES RAW 

Wash thoroughly in cold water ; trim the tops, but not close to 
the radish, leaving one long leaf as a sort of handle. Throw 
them into ice or very cold water for one hour, and serve with 
chopped ice in an oblong or round pickle dish. If spring rad- 
ishes are pared and thrown into cold water, they lose their 
flavor and quickly sour. The large winter radishes should be 
peeled and cut into thin slices, lengthwise. If eaten raw they 
must be thoroughly masticated. 



SPINACH (Spinacia olcracea, Miller) 

This name includes a number of varieties of the same plant 
which do not differ chemically, and may be cooked and served 
according to the same recipes. 



410 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

SPINACH BOILED AS GREENS 

Wash the spinach carefully by dipping it in and out of a pan 
of cold water; cut the leaves apart, wash them thoroughly, 
again plunge them up and down in a pan of cold water, shaking 
them dry. Do not drain off the water holding the spinach 
with the hand; the sand will be retained, and the spinach will 
be uneatable. After it is thoroughly washed, put it in a kettle 
in which you are cooking corned beef, and boil twenty minutes. 
Remove the beef, and drain the spinach in a colander. Dish 
the beef on a large platter, put the spinach around as a gar- 
nish, and send at once to the table. 

BOILED SPINACH 

Yz peck of spinach 2 eggs 

2 slices of bread . i teaspoonful of salt 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter 2 tablespoonfuls of cream 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Wash the spinach as directed in preceding recipe ; shake it until 
dry. Throw it into a hot kettle, add a half cup of water and 
sprinkle over the salt. Shake over the fire until the spinach is 
thoroughly melted, then cover the kettle and cook slowly 
twenty minutes. Drain carefully, turn the spinach into a 
chopping bowl and chop it very, very fine. Return it to the 
saucepan, add all the seasonings, and stir over the fire until 
smoking hot. Turn quickly into a small bowl, pack it down 
firmly to mold, and turn it out on a round dish. While the 
spinach is cooking, cut the bread into small triangles, and toast 
them carefully. Hard boil the eggs. Put the triangular pieces 
of toast around the dish as a border, leaning them against the 
spinach. Cut the eggs into sixths lengthwise, put one yolk at 
the top of the mold of spinach, and arrange around the whites 
in imitation of a daisy. Serve with beef, mutton or veal. 

SPINACH ON TOAST 

Wash, cook and chop the spinach according to preceding recipe. 
Re-heat; add the salt, pepper and butter. Have ready squares 
of nicely toasted bread. Mold the spinach quickly in small egg

cups, turn them out on the toast, dish neatly on a shallow plate, 
pour around sauce Hollandaise, and send at once to the table. 
Serve as a vegetable course, or as an accompaniment to boiled 
salted or fresh beef, or salted beef tongue. 

SPINACH WITH CREAM 

Cook according to the first recipe. In re-heating omit the 
butter, and add a half cup of thick cream. Serve in heated 
vegetable dish, garnish the top of the spinach all over with 
tiny squares of bread, carefully toasted. Serve as an accom- 
paniment to boiled salt or fresh beef tongue, or roasted beef. 

SPINACH FOR GARNISHING 

Wash and cook a half peck of spinach as directed for boiled 
spinach. After the spinach has been chopped fine, return it to 
the saucepan, add one tablespoonful of butter, sprinkle over a 
tablespoonful of flour, and add a saltspoonful of pepper and a 
half saltspoonful of salt. Stir and cook for five minutes. Then 
add a half cup of stock ; stir until boiling, add a grating of nut- 
meg, take from the fire and add an extra tablespoonful of 
butter. Use as a garnish, putting it around in a rope-like 
fashion, for hot beef a la mode or fricandeau of veal.

taining two quarts of boiling water, into which put the spinach. 
Boil rapidly for ten minutes; drain, pour over it cold water, 
return it to the dry saucepan, add the salt, and cook it slowly for 
fifteen minutes, stirring every now and then. Drain again, 
chop fine, return it to the saucepan, add all the other ingredients, 
and when hot serve in an uncovered vegetable dish, garnished 
with hard boiled eggs.

1 teaspoonful of salt i tablespoonful of butter 

2 cloves Yz pint of chicken stock 
A grating of nutmeg i teaspoonful of salt 

I tablespoonful of onion juice i saltspoonful of pepper 

Boil the spinach as directed in the first recipe ; when done, chop 
it very fine. Return it to the saucepan ; stand it over hot 
water while you make a small quantity of Spanish sauce. Rub 
the butter and flour together, add the stock, salt, pepper, nut- 
meg, cloves, and chopped onion ; cook slowly five minutes, 
strain this into the spinach, and when very hot turn into a 
shallow vegetable dish, cover the top with tiny pieces of toast 
and send at once to the table. 

Cold left-over spinach may be used for cream of spinach 
soup, spinach sauce or molded, with French dressing as a 
salad. 

STACHYS (Stachys tuberosa) 

The small tubers of this plant resemble, in texture and com- 
position, the Jerusalem artichoke, and may be cooked according 
to the same rules. Being very small, they require but ten min- 
utes for cooking; if overdone they are heavy and unpalatable. 
The shape of the tubers is that of a corkscrew, which makes 
them an attractive garnish for made dishes and salads. 

TOMATOES (Lycopersicum esculentum, Miller) 

Well ripened tomatoes contain nearly ninety per cent, of water ; 
in the remaining ten per cent, there is a very little pectose and 
mineral matter, not enough, however, to give a food value. 
Authorities disagree as to whether or not tomatoes are whole- 
some. Of one thing we are quite sure, they are detrimental to 
persons who have oxahiria or uric acid diathesis. 

Tomatoes are capable of great variation in cooking, hence, 
are exceedingly popular. There is no doubt, however, that they 
are more easily digested raw, seasoned with a little olive oil, 
salt and pepper, or salt and pepper alone. Containing oxalic 



VEGETABLES 



413 



combined with malic acid, they are sufficiently acid without the 
addition of vinegar. Served persistently with salt, pepper and 
vinegar they will produce ulcerations of the mouth and intesti- 
nal disturbances. Unripe they are used for stuffing, pickling 
and preserving. 

TO SERVE TOMATOES RAW 

Select small solid tomatoes; put them in a colander or wire 
basket, plunge them in a pan of boiling water, and quickly 
remove the skin. Place the tomatoes on the ice to cool. At 
serving time slice them, and serve with cracked ice. Pass 
seasoned oil or French dressing. 

ICED TOMATOES 

Put small round or peach tomatoes into a colander or basket, 
plunge them into boiling water, just a moment, and remove the 
skins. Place them on the ice until they are very, very cold. 
Serve on a nest of lettuce leaves, covered with finely shaved ice. 
Pass with them French dressing; or put them in little bowls, 
cover with cracked ice, and serve with powdered siiT;"ar. 



TOMATO JELLY 

I quart of stewed tomatoes i teaspoonful of ginger 

I teaspoonful of salt Juice of one lemon 

I cup of sugar 2 tablespoonfuls of cornstarch 

Strain the tomatoes, put them in a saucepan, with the ginger, 
sugar, lemon juice, and salt. Moisten the cornstarch in two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water, add it to the tomato, boil a 
moment and turn in a mold to cool. Serve cold with curried 
chicken or beef. 

TOMATOES ON THE HALF SHELL 

Cut solid tomatoes into halves; stand them in a baking pan, 
skin side down ; dust lightly with salt and pepper, and put but- 
ter the size of a large pea in the centre of each. Put into a very 
moderate oven, increasing the heat slowly. Cook for three- 
quarters of an hour or until the tomatoes are perfectly soft,

but whole. Have ready rounds of toasted bread ; put half of a 
tomato on each round of toast. Mix a tablespoonful of flour 
with four tablespoonfuls of milk, add sufficient milk to make a 
half pint; pour this in the pan, stirring constantly until it 
reaches the boiling point. Add half an onion grated, a half 
teaspoonful of salt, and a half teaspoonful of pepper. Strain 
this around the tomatoes, and send at once to the table. 
Serve for luncheon or supper. 

BOILED TOMATOES 

Select small, solid tomatoes ; throw them into boiling water, boil 
slowly five minutes. Lift, drain, dish and send at once to the 
table. To eat, open the top, put in a little butter, salt and pepper, 
and eat as you would an egg from the shell. 

These are exceedingly nice for breakfast, or they may be 
served as a vegetable for luncheon or dinner. 

STEWED TOMATOES 

Put the tomatoes into a colander or wire basket and ^tand them 
for a moment in a pan of boiling water ; lift, and with a sharp 
knife remove the skin, beginning at the blossom ends. Cut 
them into halves, squeeze out the seeds, cut the flesh into four 
or five pieces, put them into a porcelain-lined or granite sauce- 
pan, cover, and stew slowly a half hour. Add a teaspoonful of 
sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper; take 
from the fire and stir in one tablespoonful of butter ; add a 
teaspoonful of onion juice and turn into a heated vegetable dish. 
Thickening of any sort spoils the flavor of tomatoes and makes 
them rather indigestible.

FRIED TOMATOES 



Qioose six smooth, very solid tomatoes, a little under or just 
ripe ; cut them in slices an eighth of an inch thick ; dust with 
salt and pepper. Beat an egg lightly, adding a tablespoonful of 
water; dip each slice carefully in the egg and cover thickly 
with bread crumbs. Put three tablespoon fuls of oil or dripping 
into a shallow frying pan, when hot cover the bottom of the pan 
with the dipped tomatoes. Fry or saute quickly over a hot 
fire first on one side, then on the other; lift carefully with a 
skimmer ; rest them for a moment on brown paper to remove 
the grease, and serve on a heated platter. These must be 
served at once or they become soft. 

PANNED TOMATOES 

Wash and cut into halves six large, ripe tomatoes. Place them 
into a baking pan skin side down. Cut a quarter of a pound 
of butter into half inch pieces, place one piece in the centre of 
each half tomato ; dust the tomatoes with a teaspoonful of salt 
and a saltspoonful of pepper mixed. Stand the pan in a hot 
oven for twenty minutes, then over the fire to brown quickly. 
Do not turn the tomatoes. When done lift them carefully with 
a cake turner and place on a heated dish. Draw the pan over a 
good fire and stir until all the liquor has been evaporated, leav- 
ing the butter; add two tablespoonfuls of flour, mix until 
smooth; add a pint of milk and one piece of tomato mashed 
from the skin ; stir continuously until the sauce reaches the 
boiling point ; add a half teaspoonful of salt, and strain it over 
the tomatoes. Garnish the dish with toast and send at once 
to the table. 

This may be served in the place of meat for luncheon or 
supper. 

BROILED TOMATOES 

Cut solid tomatoes into halves ; do not peel them ; place them on 
a broiler, dust with salt and pepper, and broil over a mederate 
fire, skin side down, for twenty minutes. Transfer them care- 
fully to a heated dish, and put over a little melted butter. 
Nice for breakfast or supper. 



VEGETABLES 417 

CURRIED TOMATOES 

Select four good-sized tomatoes; plunge them into hot water, 
remove the skins, cut them into halves, press lightly to take out 
the seeds and cut each half into halves again, making quarters. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan, add two onions 
chopped fine. Stand the saucepan in a pan of water, and cook 
slowly until the onion is tender. Add a teaspoonful of curry 
powder, a teaspoonful of turmeric, a bay leaf and a half pint of 
water or, better still, cocoanut milk. When this reaches the 
boiling point, put in the tomatoes, cover the saucepan, cook 
over a moderate fire for twenty minutes. While these are cook- 
ing, boil one cupful of rice. Drain the rice, and when dry heap 
it into the centre of a meat platter. Put around the tomatoes, 
which should not be broken ; strain over the sauce and send at 
once to the table. 

With baked or stewed bananas this makes a delightful sup- 
per dish. 

TOMATOES AND OKRA WITH CURRY 

Peel six good-sized tomatoes, cut them into halves, and squeeze 
out the seeds. Put them into a saucepan and stew ten minutes ; 
then with a knife or spoon cut them into small pieces-. Add a 
tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful 
of curry powder. Have ready cooked a pint of okra ; or use a 
can of okra. Put a layer of okra in the bottom of the baking 
dish, then a layer of tomato and a tablespoonful of chopped 
onion. Sprinkle over this two tablespoonfuls of dry bread 
crumbs, then another layer of okra and tomato and the season- 
ing, having the top layer bread crumbs. Cut a tablespoonful 
of butter into bits, put it over the top, and over this put a 
layer, about one inch, of carefully boiled rice. Cover the baking 
dish and bake in a quick oven thirty minutes. While this is 
baking, rub together a tablespoonful of butter and one of flour ; 
add a half pint of boiling water, stir until boiling; add a half 
teaspoonful of salt and the juice of half a lemon. When the 
tomatoes are done, strain the sauce over the top of the rice aiid 
send to the table in the dish in which it was baked. 



418 MRS. RORER's new COOK BOOK 

This should be cooked in an ordinary casserole dish. 

If the top is again sprinkled with a mixture of chopped 
nuts, you have one of the most delightful of vegetarian dinner 
dishes. 

TOMATOES, FRENCH FASHION 

Peel small solid tomatoes ; to each half dozen allow a half pint 
of cream sauce, made by rubbing together a rounding table- 
spoonful of flour and the same of butter ; add a half pint of cold 
milk, stir until boiling; add a half teaspoonful of salt, a salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Put a tablespoonful of the sauce in the bot- 
tom of six ramekin dishes, or custard cups. Stand a tomato 
in each, cover with the remaining sauce, stand the dishes in a 
baking pan and bake in a moderate oven thirty minutes. Serve 
in the dishes in which they are cooked. 



TOMATO FIGS 

6 pounds of tomatoes 3 pounds of granulated sugar 

Select small pear yellow or red tomatoes that are fully ripe, or 
use the little peach tomatoes. Put them in a basket, plunge 
them into boiling water for a moment and remove the skins ; do 
not break the tomatoes. Cover the bottom of a porcelain-lined 
kettle with a portion of the sugar ; put over a layer of tomatoes 
and the remainder of the sugar. Do not have more than two 
layers of tomatoes ; in fact, it is better to do one layer at a time. 
Place the kettle over a moderate fire and cook slowly until the 
sugar penetrates to the very centre of the tomato. Lift each 
tomato carefully with a large fork or spoon ; spread them on a 
stoneware or granite dish and stand in the hot sun for one or 
two days. Put them out in the morning after the sun is quite up 
and hot. Take them in at night before the dew. While they are 
drying sprinkle them several times with granulated sugar ; when 
perfectly dry put them between layers of waxed paper in tin 
boxes. If done properly tomato figs will keep nicely all winter, 
and are one of the daintiest of sweetmeats.

GROUND CHERRY, OR POD TOMATO 

These are also known as the strawberry tomato, and Cape goose- 
berry. They belong to the same family to which the tomato 
belongs. Both the red, Physalis Alkekcngi, Linn., and the 
yellow, Philadelphica, are used for preserving the same as 
strawberries. They are frequently dried and put away between 
layers of wax paper to be used as sweetmeats. 

TURNIPS 

Of these we have two varieties, Brassica campestris, Linn., the 
ruta-baga or Swedish turnip, and Brassica Rapa, Linn., the 
white turnip. The Swedish turnip or ruta-baga is not so sweet, 
but slightly more nutritious than the common white turnip ; both 
are prepared after the same recipes. 

In chemical composition the turnip is very much like the 
cabbage, save that it contains a little more water and less nitro- 
genous matter. They do not contain either sugar or starch. 
The carbohydrates are presented in the form of inidiii and pec- 
tose, which make them an agreeable and harmless vegetable for 
diabetic persons, provided they are cooked carefully and served 
with salt, pepper and butter only. 

Turnip tops or sprouts of the old turnips, are l)oiled as 
greens, or served raw as a spring salad. When well prepared, 
they are quite palatable.

BOILED WITH POTATO 

Pare four good-sized white turnips, cut them into slices, throw 
them into boiling unsalted water and cook just below the boiling 
point in an uncovered vessel until transparent. Drain in a 
colander. Have ready boiled an equal quantity of potatoes ; 
wh^en the potatoes are dry, turn them in the colander with the 
turnips and press both through into a dry dish. Add a table- 
spoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pep- 
per ; beat until light. Add four tablespoonfuls of hot milk, beat 
again, turn into an uncovered dish, and send at once to the 
table. 

Serve with beef a la mode, boiled beef or roasted duck. 

SWEDISH TURNIPS WITH SWEET POTATOES 

Pare two good-sized ruta-bagas and cut them into slices. Wash 
and bake four sweet potatoes. Cook the Swedish turnips in 
unsalted water below the boiling point until perfectly tender ; 
drain, and press them through a colander. Open the baked 
sweet potatoes, scoop out the centres, add them to the Swedish 
turnips, add a tablespoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Beat the two until very light, heap 
them into a baking dish, brush the top with milk and bake in a 
quick oven until a golden brown, about twenty minutes.

Cut and boil the turnips as directed in preceding recipe. When 
done, drain ; arrange the slices in a baking pan, dust them with 
granulated sugar, and put a piece of butter the size of a pea in 
the centre of each slice. Put them in a very hot oven or in the 
lower chamber of a gas stove to brown quickly. Serve with 
roasted tame or wild duck. 

TURNIPS, GERMAN FASHION 

Pare the turnips, cut them into dice, wash and drain. Put two 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil into a shallow frying or saute pan ; 
when hot put in the turnips and shape them over a hot fire until 
a golden brown. Turn them into a saucepan and add sufficient 
mutton stock to cover. Boil slowly until tender, about a half 
hour. Rub together two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of 
flour ; add a pint of the stock in which they were boiled, stir 
until boiling, add a teaspoon ful of onion juice, a teaspoonful of 
kitchen bouquet, a level teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Drain the turnips, turn them into a vegetable dish and 
pour over the brown sauce. 

These are usually cooked and served with boiled mutton ; a 
portion of the mutton stock may be used for cooking the 
turnips.

TURNIP BALLS 

These are cut from the turnips with an ordinary vegetable scoop. 
Serve plain boiled with melted butter, as an accompaniment to 
mutton. They are also frequently used as a garnish to boiled 
corned beef. 

Cold left-over turnips may be used with mutton or chicken 
stock for cream of turnip soup. 



A GROUP OF SALAD PLANTS 

Although some of the plants in this group are frequently cooked, 
they are decidedly more palatable and attractive when served 
raw. They are quite free from sugar and starch ; are very 
succulent, containing from 90 to 95 per cent, water, and a small 
amount of mineral matter. A few contain pungent volatile 
oils to which they owe their flavor. 

CHICORY (Cichorium Intybus, Linn.) 

Chicory very nearly resembles the well bleached endive, except 
that the leaves are tiny, split and very sweet. It is one of the 
best of winter salad materials; it may be served alone, eaten 
with salt, in place of celery, or dressed with French dressing 
and served as a dinner salad. 

The roots are sliced, dried, roasted, ground and used as an 
addition to coffee or as a coffee adulterant. Many cheap ground 
coffees are largely chicory. A little finely powdered chicory 
root mixed with a good coffee improves the infusion, but the 
mixing should be done at home ; coffee is expensive and chicory 
cheap. 

CORN SALAD OR LAMB'S LETTUCE 

{V alerianella olitoria, Poll.) 

This plant grows wild in Southern Europe, and is cultivated 
in the eastern part of the United States for early spring salads. 
It comes just between the winter and spring lettuce. The size 
and flavor of the leaves are greatly improved by cultivation. 



VEGETABLES 



423 



ENDIVE (Cichorium Endizna, Linn.) 

This plant is grown in late summer and fall for a winter salad. 
When full grown the root leaves are tied up in a bunch, covered 
with boards and earth and bleached the same as celery. When 
well bleached, curly and crisp makes an excellent salad. If not 
well bleached or too old for bleaching, it is bitter and unpalat- 
able. Cut in two-inch lengths, mix with lettuce or celery, 
and serve with French dressing as a dinner salad. The out- 
side green leaves are frequently cut into small pieces, boiled in 
salt water and served as greens. 



GARDEN CRESS OR PEPPER GRASS 

(Lepidimn sativum) 

This resembles, in flavor and appearance, the ordinary water 
cress. When old, the leaves become exceedingly pungent and 
are unfit to use alone. Sprinkled over cabbage or lettuce, they 
give just a little of the mustard flavoring without the irritating 
effect of the ground mustard. When young and tender, they 
may be used alone with French dressing for a dinner salad. 

LETTUCE (Lacttica sativa, Linn.) 

The varieties of lettuce supply a wholesome, cooling, palatable 
and digestible dinner salad. It is occasionally cooked, although 
the flavor and palatability are spoiled. The head or cabbage let- 
tuce and the cos or upright (Romaine) are the commonest 
forms sold in this country. The long leaves of the cos or 
Romaine are tied together, covered with boards and earth for 
the purpose of bleaching. The extra time spent in care of this 
variety makes it quite expensive compared to common head 
lettuce. Lefttuce is the common green served with French 
dressing as a dinner salad. It is too light and delicate to be 
served with mayonnaise. 



MUSTARD 

The young leaves of the Brassica alba are sweet and bland, and 
form an attractive spring salad. They do not contain any of 



424 MRS. RORER'is NEW COOK BOOK 

the pungent oils found in the seeds. They may be mixed with 
corn salad, chicory or early spring lettuce, dressed with French 
or Italian dressing, and served as a dinner salad. 



WATER CRESS {Nasturtium oMcinale, R. Brown.) 

This plant grows wild on constantly running streamlets, some- 
times spreading over the entire surface of the water, stopping 
the flow of the stream. The entire young plant is eaten. It may 
be used as a garnish or served in salads. It is antiscorbutic, 
palatable and wholesome. 

Water cress owes its flavor to a volatile oil which grows 
very pungent as the plant matures and blossoms. Mixed vvith 
young dandelion leaves or spring lettuce or with shredded cab- 
bage, it is much better than when served alone. 



A FEW EDIBLE WEEDS 

SOURDOCK {Rmnex crispus, Linn.) 

This common weed grows along the roadsides or in rich pasture 
fields in the northern, western and central western United 
States. It is called sour dock or long, curly-leafed dock to dis- 
tinguish it from the shorter wide-leafed dock. It may be cooked 
and served according to the rules for spinach. It makes, how- 
ever, a much more delicate green. As it grows in the early 
spring, it gives the ordinary farmer an accessible vegetable long 
before other garden greens are ready for use. It is usually 
served with boiled salt beef or pork. This contains oxalic acid. 



SORREL {Runiex Acetosella, Linn.) 

This IS the common sheep sorrel, or sour grass, an exceedingly 
common weed in all parts of the United States. A similar 
variety, Rume.v Acetosa, is cultivated as a spring vegetable. 
Both of these are used mixed with lettuce or chicory, dressed 
with French dressing as a dinner salad. It is also used for 



VEGETABLES 426 

soups and sauces. Sorrel sauce is a common accompaniment to 
roasted or fricandeau of veal, or veal cutlets. All sorrel contains 
oxalic acid and oxalates in goodly quantity. 

POKE SHOOTS 

These are the young shoots of the Phytolacca decandra, also 
called scoke or pigeon berry weed. In Eastern Pennsylvania the 
}oung shoots form a common green in the early spring. They 
are sold in the markets in bundles, and are cooked and served 
the same as asparagus. 

LAMBS' QUARTERS 

(Chenopodium capitatum, Watson) 

This is one of the commonest of garden weeds, and is the most 
delicate of the so-called greens. It may be cooked after any of 
the recipes given for spinach. 

Chenopodium album, or white goosefoot, is cultivated in 
England and by English gardeners in the United States, and is 
considered one of the finest of garden greens. These contain a 
very little oxalic acid. 

PURSLANE (Portulacca oleracea, Linn.) 

Purslane is a hardy annual plant, a common weed in most 
gardens. It is much stronger and better when cultivated. 
Boiled in salted water it forms an admirable green. It may also 
be added to stews, and is used frequently for sauces to serve 
with boiled salted beef. 

BOILED PURSLANE 

Wash the purslane well in cold water, throw it into a kettle of 
boihng salted water, boil thirty minutes, drain and turn into 
a heated vegetable dish. Add to the water a bay leaf and six 
tablespoon fuls of vinegar. Boil until reduced one-half; add a 
tablespoonful of butter, and when melted, strain over the purs- 
lane, and send at once to the table as an accompaniment to spiced 
bt-ef, beef a la mode, or fricandeau of veal.

SHEPHERDS* PURSE 

(Capsella Bursa-Pastoris, Moench) 

This is a common weed in waste places and takes its name from 
its little purse-shaped seed pod. It may be boiled and served the 
same as spinach. 

DANDELION (Taraxacum officinale, Weber) 

It is scarcely worth while to describe this very common weed ; 
almost every child is perfectly well acquainted with the early 
yellow flower of the dandelion. The young root leaves are 
gathered in the early spring and used raw as a salad; or they 
may be boiled and served as greens according to any of the 
recipes for spinach. The leaves grow bitter as they grow older. 
For this reason the young leaves only should be selected. Dan- 
delions form one of the most wholesome of all greens. Contain- 
ing, as they do, taraxacum, they are especially good for the 
liver. Dandelion roots are cut into slices, dried and used medi- 
cinally. In some parts of the West they are also toasted and 
used as a coflfee substitute. Mixed with roasted wheat and bar- 
ley, they form what is known as "poor man's coffee." 

WILD PEPPER GRASS 

(Lepidium Virginicwn, Linn.) 

This is a common weed growing by the road-sides, called by the 
country folk, wild mustard. The leaves are similar to those of 
the true mustard and make an excellent flavoring for salads. 
They contain just enough of the mustard flavor to be agreeable, 
without the irritating effects of ground mustard. 

PLANTS USED AS SEASONINGS AND 
FLAVORINGS 

PARSLEY 

Parsley (Carum petroselinum, Bentham) is one of the common 
plants used as a flavoring and garnish for both meats and vege- 
tables. It should be served and eaten with the dish as it con- 
tains antiscorbutic qualities. 



VEGETABLES 



427 



TO DRY PARSLEY 

Pick the parsley when full grown, before flowering; wash 
thoroughly ; shake dry, tie in loose bunches, hang in the air in 
the sun, or put on a board to dry in a moderately warm oven. 
When dry, rub the leaves to a powder, and put them through a 
fine sieve, bottle, cork and keep in a dry, cold closet. 



TO DRY PARSLEY FOR GARNISHING 

Select the large curly parsley, plunge it into boiling water, a 
single piece at a time. Shake thoroughly, dry according to the 
preceding recipe, but do not powder. Put the parsley in tin 
boxes between layers of waxed paper and keep in a dry place. 
In winter, when wanted for use, soak in cold water, shake and 
use the same as the fresh parsley. 



CHERVIL 

Sweet chervil (Myrrhis odorata, Linn.), a pungent, aro- 
matic plant used as flavoring for salads and as a garnish to 
delicate meat dishes. It is easily cultivated. 



TO DRY CHERVIL 

Pick the chervil in the middle of the day and just before the 
flowering period. Dry in the sun in the air, or in a warm oven. 
Powder, and put away for use. 



TARRAGON {Artemisia Dracunculus) 

The green leaves of tarragon are mixed with lettuce and served 
with French dressing as a dinner salad. 

They are also dried and used in powdered form and pre- 
served in vinegar. Tarragon vinegar is commonly used for 
sour sauces or dressings. 



428 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

ANGELICA (Archangelica officinalis, Linn.) 

The stem of this plant resembles rhubarb in size and texture. 
It is pressed and made into sweet wine and a cordial, called 
chart ruse. It is conserved as a sweetmeat, and used for the 
flavoring of puddings ; it is also cut into tiny rings and mixed 
with candies. 

CAPERS 

These are the flower buds of Capparis spinosa, a trailing shrub 
grown largely in Southern Europe. The buds are packed in 
bottles and covered with vinegar. They are used as flavoring 
to sauces and salads. 

NASTURTIUM {Tropceoliim majus, Linn.) 

The fruit of the common garden nasturtium has a flavor similar 
to capers, and is frequently used as a substitute. It is also 
added to pickles as a preservative, and sometimes to spiced 
fruits. A half pint of nasturtiums added to a large jar of 
pickles will prevent mold. The flowers are used for sandwiches 
and as a garnish to summer salads. 

GARLIC {Allium sativum) 

A very pungent member of the onion tribe. The small bulbs or 
"cloves" grow in large clusters. One *'clove" is sufficient to 
flavor a good-sized dish. Garlic vinegar is used in the place of 
common vinegar as a seasoning to salads. 

A "CHAPON" 

Pare four "cloves" of garlic, cut them into thin sHces, press 
them into a crust from the end of a good-sized loaf of bread. 
Put this in the bottom of a salad dish, cover over the salad and 
allow it to stand a half hour before serving time. This imparts 
the most delicate aroma to the whole dish. 

GARLIC SEASONING 

In making French dressing rub the bowl of the spoon, with 
which you mix the dressing, thoroughly with a "clove" of gar 
lie, peeled and split into halves.

VEGETABLES 429 

SHALLOT OR ESCHALOT 

(Allium Ascalonicum, Linn.) 

Shallots are the minor members of the onion tribe. They are 
usually chopped or finely sliced and sprinkled over the top of 
salads. They are also used as a delicate flavoring for soups 
and sauces. They are sold in the eastern markets by the quart, 
and in appearance resemble the brown skinned onion "sets." 

CHIVES (Allium Schoenoprasum, Linn.) 

In appearance these resemble the wild or crow garlic, whictt 
grows in pastures in the early spring. They are sold in the 
markets, roots, bulbs and top, packed in small strawberry boxes. 
The green tops are washed, chopped and sprinkled over 
salads as flavoring. 

BAY LEAVES (Laurus nobilis, Linn.) 

The dried leaves of this plant come to us from the district of the 
Mediterranean. The plant does not grow outside of the con- 
servatories in America. The leaves can be purchased at any 
drug store ; five or ten cents' worth will last a family of six for 
a year. They have a mild, peculiar aroma, and form a most 
acceptable flavoring for soups and stews. 

GUMBO FILEE POWDER 

This is made from the very young leaves of the sassafras tree 
(Sassafras officinale, Nees) . Pick the first tiny leaves that come 
out in the spring, during the middle of a dry day. Spread them 
in the sun or in a moderately hot oven, to dry quickly. When 
perfectly dry rub them first in the hands, and then through a 
fine hair or wire sieve, and bottle for use. These leaves are 
very rich in mucilage, and are used as thickening to gumbo. 
Allow a teaspoon ful to each quart. The famous Brunswick 
stew of Virginia is also tliickened with gumbo filee powder. 

MARJORAM (Origanum majorana, Linn.) 
SUMMER SAVORY (Saturcia Jiortensis, Linn.) 
SAGE (Salvia ofUcinalis, Linn.) 



430 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

SWEET BASIL {Ocimum Basilicum) 

Do not mistake this for the wild basil or mountain pink of this 
country. Sweet basil does not grow wild in the United States, 
but it is grown by gardeners as a kitchen or pot-herb. 

All these herbs are used as seasonings to meat dishes and 
stuffings. 

THYME 

Of this there are two varieties; the common thyme, Thymus 
vulgaris, or wild thyme, and the creeping thyme, Thymus 
Serpyllum, or garden thyme. 

MINT 
SPEARMINT {Mentha viridis, Linn.) 

This is also called meadow mint ; it grows wild in most parts of 
the United States. It is used both fresh and dried. Chopped 
fine, mixed with vinegar and sugar, it forms the common mint 
sauce served with lamb. Bruised and boiled with syrup it is 
used for sherbets and punches. Conserved it is sold as a 
sweetmeat, the same as candied violets and rose leaves. It may 
be dried to use for sweets or preserved in vinegar for sauce and 
salads. 

TO DRY HERBS 

All herbs may be dried according to the following rule : 

Gather them just before flowering, on a very dry day, about 
ten or eleven o'clock, and make sure they are quite free from 
dew. Shake, remove each leaf carefully from the stems, and 
place them on soft brown paper on a board in the hot sun : 
or tie in bunches and hang in the air in the hot sun ; or place 
them in a moderately hot oven. No matter which method is 
selected, the herbs must be dried quickly, to retain color and 
flavor. When dry, rub the leaves to a powder, sift, and put 
them at once in bottles. Cork and keep in a dry closet.

This powder or mixture is used for flavoring stuffings, beef 
a la mode, brown sauces, and other savory meat dishes. 

SPICES 

ANISE (Pimpinella anisum) 

The seeds of this plant contain an essential oil used for the 
flavoring of cordials and punches. 

CARDAMOM (Elettaria cardmnomum) 

The seeds of this plant are used as flavoring for pilau and many 
of the East Indian meat dishes. Ground, they are one of the 
ingredients of curry powder. 

CARAWAY (Carww Carui, Linn.) 
CORIANDER (Coriandrum sativum, Linn.) 
CUMIN-SEED (Cuminuin cyminum) 
FENNEL (F<rniculum officinale, Allioni) 

The seeds of all these plants are used by the Germans as 
flavoring for cakes and breads. They are also greatly prized 
by the Orientals. Ground, they are the principal ingredients of 
curry powder; cumin-seeds are the chosen flavor for Dutch 
cheese. 

DILL (Pnicedanum gravcolcns) 

This plant resembles fennel ; in fact, fennel is always used when 
dill cannot be obtained. Holland pickles, or Dutch cucumbers, 
are large cucumbers preserved in brine richly flavored with dill, 
and sold under the name of dill pickles. 



432 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

CINNAMON 

True cinnamon consists of the dried inner bark of the tropical 
tree, Cinnamomuni zeylaniciim. This bark is thin, brittle and 
of a light brown color. Cinnamon is the mildest of all spices, 
and for this reason is used with delicate fruits, and as flavoring 
for cakes, as cinnamon bun and Spanish bun. Much of the low 
priced cinnamon is the bark of the cassia tree, another species 
of the same genus. Cassia is coarse and woody, and lacks the 
delicate flavoring of the true cinnamon. A ''stick" of cinna- 
mon is one piece of the bark, usually six or eight inches in 
length. 

ALLSPICE 

Pimenta (allspice) consists of the berry of the Eugenia pimenta, 
a tropical evergreen tree. This is sold both whole and ground. 
On account of the richness of flavor and its similarity to all the 
other spices, it is called "allspice." 

CLOVES 

Cloves are the dry flower buds of the Eugenia caryophyllafa. 
In purchasing cloves select those rich in oil and dark in color. 
Cloves being much more pungent than other spices, must be 
used sparingly. 

MUSTARD FLOUR 

The ground mustard, or mustard flour, is composed of both 
white and black mustard seeds. Some of the cheaper varieties 
are largely adulterated with cracker and bread crumbs ; in fact, 
they have but a trace of mustard. The white seeds are pun- 
gent, but contain no essential oil. The black seeds contain an 
acrid substance, which when moistened is changed by the action 
of an enzyme {myosin) mio a pungent essential oil, very hot 
and irritating. For this reason mustard is not used as a season- 
ing to delicate foods. Added to mayonnaise or French dressing 
it completely vipsets the digestibility of the salad, besides spoil- 
ing or overpowering the delicate flavoring. Under all circum- 



VEGETABLES 4.33 

stances use it most cautiously, and under no conditions add it to 
the food for invalids or delicate children. 

The German mustards, especially those sold in this country, 
consist of Rhine wine thickened with cornstarch, flavored with 
spices, and made pungent with black mustard. This mustard is 
less irritating than the ordinary home-made mustard. 

The bright yellow mustards are, as a rule, colored with 
turmeric. 

TURMERIC (Curcuma Longa) 

The rhizome of this plant is dried, ground and used as coloring 
(yellow), and flavoring for pickles and curry. In fact, it is 
the chief ingredient in curry powders. "Turmeric paper" is used 
for the determination of alkalies. 

INDIAN CURRY POWDER 

54 pound of coriander seed j4 pound of turmeric 



2 ounces of cumin seed 



2 ounces of fennel seed ^2 ounce of mustard 



'2 ounce of cinnamon 



^ ounce of Jamaica ginger

I ounce of cardamom seed 
10 small bay leaves 

Grind and mix all the ingredients, except the bay leaves, cover, 
and stand them aside over night. Next morning, rub them 
through a fine hair or wire sieve, put the powder into bottles, 
mixing with it the bay leaves ; cork sufficiently tight to com- 
pletely exclude the air. 

NUTMEG 

These are the seed kernels of the Myristica fragrans, a hand- 
some tropical evergreen tree. They are exceedingly rich in an 
essential, pungent oil. The fruit, in appearance, resembles a 
peach. After removing the flesh part, we come first to the seed 
coat, mace, then to the seed, which, when removed, gives us the 
kernel known as nutmeg. In preparation for the market, thcso 
kernels are rolled in lime to prevent the attack of insects. The 
short, round or "female" nutmegs are best ; the "male" nutmeg 
is long, rather dry, and contains but little essential oil. 



434 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

MACE 

Mace is the accessory seedcoat to the nutmeg, and like it has a 
fixed, as well as an essential oil. The latter is more pungent in 
mace than in nutmeg. It is .sold in the market both whole and 
ground, and is used as an ordinary spice. In removing the mace 
from the nutmeg, it is usually broken into halves, one of these 
pieces being called a * 'blade" of mace. 

BLACK PEPPER 

Black pepper is made from the unripe berries of piper nigrum. 
The berries are picked when red, dried and then ground, shells 
and all. The whole berries are called "pepper corns." 

WHITE PEPPER 

This is made from the ripe seed kernels of the same berry. The 
dark outside husk is rejected. Both white and black pepper 
contain an essential oil, and flavoring known as peperin. Of 
the two, the white is much more pungent. 

Coarsely ground white pepper is called "mignonette" pepper. 

GINGER (Zingiber oiHcinale, Linn.) 

This plant is a native of both the East and the West Indies, 
where it is used as seasoning for nearly all sweet and made 
dishes. Our common ginger is the fleshy rhizome, dried and 
ground. These rhizomes also come to us in the early fall in a 
green condition, and are used by the housewife as flavoring to 
insipid fruits, as citron, melon, and water melon rind. It is also 
preserved, or crystallized, and served as a sweetmeat. The 
very young tender rhizomes are scraped, boiled in a syrup until 
perfectly clear, and are sold in our markets under the name of 
candied ginger "stems." They are more expensive than the 
common candied ginger, are sweeter, less pungent and less 
woody. The best ginger is that which comes from the Island 
of Jamaica. The dark integument is thoroughly scraped oflF the 



VEGETABLES 



435 



stems, and they are then dried and gWDund. For this reason, 
Jamaica ginger is known as "white ginger." This is much more 
expensive at first cost, than the common ground ginger, but one- 
half the measure only need be used. Too much ginger hinders 
digestion. A small quantity used as seasoning, or a bit taken at 
the close of a meal, aids digestion, in preventing unnatural fer- 
mentations from springing up and overpowering the natural, 
weaker ones. For this reason curry powder, fresh or ground 
ginger, are a constant ingredient of meat dishes in the very hot 
climates. They stimulate digestion. If spices and high season- 
ing are ever to be recommended it certainly is in hot weather, 
when the digestion is rather sluggish. 



SALTED GINGER 

This makes an agreeable addition to curries, and is a valuable 
seasoning to hot weather meat dishes. 

Scrape two pounds of green ginger root after they have been 
soaked over night in cold water. Cover them with salt water, 
and let them stand twenty-four hours; then add a half cup 
of good salt, to each quart of water, that has been boiled and 
cooled. Pack the ginger into glass jars, cover with the brine, 
adjust the rubbers, and screw on the tops. This will keep 
nicely all winter. 

GINGER CHUTNEY 



1 pound of apples 

2 ounces of fresh or salted gin- 

ger 
4 tablespoonfuls of soy 
4 tablespoonfuls of sherry 



large cucumber 



onion

Peel the cucumber, cut it into halves, and scoop out the seeds ; 
peel the onion, pare and core the apples and chop them fine ; add 
to them the ginger, chopped or grated, and all the other ingre- 
dients. Put into glass jars, shake every day for one week, and 
it is ready for use. Serve as an accompaniment to broiled or 
panned chicken. 



436 MRS. RORER*S NEW COOK BOOK 

FLAVORINGS 

True flavorings are made from the essential oils of the fruits, 
seeds, or flowers, of the plants from which they take their 
names. Those bearing the name of the fruits, not containing 
essential oils, are called artificial flavorings. These are made 
from compound ethers, and colored to match their respective 
fruits. Bartlet pear, for instance, is a good example of an arti- 
ficial flavoring. It is delightful, fragrant, but perfectly innocent 
of the fruit of which it bears the name. ''Pineapple" flavor is 
another of this type, made from aldehyde, ethyl-butyrate, amyl- 
butyrate, chloroform and glycerin. True vanilla is very 
accurately copied in the same way. These flavors are largely 
used for fruit jellies, jams, soda water and candies. Unfortu- 
nately, we do not know whether or not they are injurious; let 
them alone to make sure. Many flavorings can be made at 
home ; in fact, the list is sufficiently large to remove the necessity 
of buying any form of extracts. 

VANILLA 

Vanilla is the fruit of Vanilla planifolia, a climbing orchid of 
Mexico and Central America. The fruit is in the form of a 
slender pod, from six to eight inches long, and dark in color. 
It owes its aroma to a substance called vanillin, which is now 
artificially made from some of the compound ethers, and also 
from coniferin, a substance found in the sapwood of the pines. 
On account of the accessibility and cheapness of the ethers, they 
are almost exclusively used in the preparation of cheap vanilla 
extracts. 

Tonka bean, on account of the similarity of flavor, is a com- 
mon adulterant. While it is mild and has an agreeable odor, 
to the connoisseur it is very unlike true vanilla. The aromatic 
flavor of a good vanilla bean is not lost in the cooking, while 
that of the cheap, artificial vanilla is easily dissipated. There is 
an aroma, but not that of true vanilla. 

The delicate, much sought after flavor of the Philadelphia 
vanilla ice cream, is due to the cooking of the bean in a portion 
of the cream ; or it may be rubbed with the sugar. 



VEGETABLES 



437 



VANILLA SUGAR 

%, pound of loaf or granulated sugar 2 good vanilla beans 

Put the sugar into a mortar; split the bean into halves on a 
sheet of white paper. With a blunt silver knife scrape out the 
seeds, put them with the sugar in the mortar, then scoop out a 
portion of the bean, being very careful not to waste any of the 
seeds. Work the two together in the mortar until the sugar is 
thoroughly mixed with the vanilla. Bottle and put away. The 
outside portion of the beans may be cut into tiny bits, and put 
in a bottle to be used as flavorings for custard. Cook a few 
small pieces in the milk in a double boiler. 

VANILLA EXTRACT 

Cut four beans into halves and then into small lengths. Put 
them into a quart fruit jar, with a pint of good alcohol. Adjust 
the rubber and screw on the top. Shake the bottle every day for 
one month without unscrewing. At the end of that time, filter 
the extract, bottle and cork. Add a second half pint of alcohol 
to the beans in the jar, and proceed as before. Of the first, use 
for flavoring only a half teaspoonful to each quart of liquid ; of 
the second, a teaspoonful. A little caramel will give the extract 
the desired or common color. 



ORANGE FLAVORING 

The flavoring of both orange and lemon is due to a volatile <m1 
found in the yellow rind. Secure fully ripe, yellow oranges, 
grate off the thin yellow rind, and to each ounce allow a half 
pint of good alcohol. Put the two together in a fruit jar ; shake 
them every day for a month ; then filter and bottle for use. 
Lemon Extract is made in precisely the same way. 

BITTER ALMOND 

Bitter almond is a variety of the common almond, the extract 
of which is used as flavoring for candies and white cakes. It 



438 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

vshould be used with great care, on account of the quantity of 
hydrocyanic acid it contains. 

Peach leaves are frequently used by the country folk as 
flavoring for cakes. Put a few peach leaves on the cake cloth 
or rack, turn the cake out on the leaves, and allow it to remain 
until cold. It will have the most delicate flavor of bitter 
almonds. 



SALADS 



The term salad is applied to certain cold dishes composed either 
of meats, fish or vegetables. For generations these have been 
served with a mixture of oil and vinegar, or oil, egg and vine- 
gar. The oil furnishes the fatty matter for the meal, and being 
purely vegetable is more wholesome than the ordinary animal 
fats. Butter and cream are wholesome if taken unheated, but 
to make salad dressing, the butter is usually melted ; hence its 
digestibility is destroyed, and under such circumstances a salad 
is robbed of its mission. 

In these latter days many American cooks make a mixture 
of fruit, sugar and alcohol, and serve them as ''salads." These 
fare not salads ; are heavy, rather unwholesome, and will never 
take the place of a salad. I much prefer to call them fruit cock- 
tails, and serve them as first course at luncheon or a twelve 
o'clock breakfast ; or a dessert, and serve them with the ices at> 
the close of the meal. Fruits mixed with mayonnaise dressing, 
and served as a salad are unsightly, unpalatable and a little 
nauseating. One cannot think of anything more out of keeping 
than white grapes in a thick mayonnaise. The simple so- 
called French dressing is delicate and most worthy of recom- 
mendation. Over lettuce, cress or celery it certainly makes a 
palatable and wholesome dinner salad, and one in which chil- 
dren can be freely indulged. Such fruits as apples, pears, cher- 
ries, and pineapples, mixed with celery or lettuce, with Frencli 
dressing, make an agreeable dinner salad. 

A salad, simple in its construction, should be seen on every 
well regulated table three hundred and sixty-five times a year. 
Persons living in the country or on the outskirts of towns can 
without cost always pick sorrel, long dock, dandelions, and 
lambs' quarters. Tn the city, one can, for a few pennies, buy 
sufficient greens for a dainty salad. Tf you cannot afford salad 
and dessert, choose the former bv all means. The happiest

closing to a real good dinner is a crisp salad well dressed, 
served with a bit of cheese and bread and butter or toasted 
cracker. 

Left-over green vegetables, as beans, peas, carrots, turnips, 
may be used separately or mixed, dressed with French dressing, 
and served as a dinner salad. When you are cooking vegetables 
to-day for dinner, cook double the quantity, saving a portion to 
serve cold for to-morrow's salad. Asparagus is much better 
cold than hot. Cold boiled cauliflower, carefully cooked spin- 
ach, leeks, beets, may all take their place in this delightful dish. 

The Romans and Greeks used salads at the beginning of 
their dinner to create an appetite. In later days, however, 
salads are served at the end of the heavy portion of the dinner, 
or with the game, to bring back or sharpen the flagging appetite 
to the greater enjoyment of the final sweet. 

The green vegetables contain the salts necessary to the well 
being of our blood, and oil is an important and essential food. 
The garlic and vinegar aid in the digestion and assimilation 
of other foods. In the use of garlic w^e must be most temperate. 
Rub the bottom of the bowl, or the bowl of the salad spoon. 
Bits of garlic throughout the salad are most unpleasant. Better 
use decided flavorings, in the form of flavored or scented vine- 
gars. Put a few cloves of garlic into your vinegar cruet; into 
another, a little celery seed, or chervil ; a mixture of these vine- 
gars, or alternate use, will give variety and agreeable flavor. 
Tarragon vinegar is commonly used with mayonnaise dressing, 
sauce tartare, sauce Bearnaise and rich dressings of this char- 
acter. Any small, fine greens that are in season, such as chives, 
mint, or chervil, may be finely minced and sprinkled over the 
dinner lettuce. 

Standing at the very head of salad vegetables is the cos, 
or Romaine lettuce, and the ordinary delicate head lettuce, and 
corn salad, endive, chicory, sorrel, celery, garden and water 
cress, tomatoes and cucumbers. In the early spring the young 
tender dandelion leaves mixed with lettuce and a little carefully 
cooked beet root make a delightful dinner salad. Radishes, 
tomatoes and turnips are frequently used chopped fine, sprinkled 
over lettuce. Cauliflower, string beans, delicate shelled beans 



SALADS

and peas, all add to the dinner salad. In the winter, cabbage 
and celery furnish us our daily salads. Nothing can be more 
delicate and delightful than the crisp, carefully cut, hard portion 
of a well bleached head of cabbage. 

A spherical wire basket, known as a salad shaker, or drainer, 
is used to dry the salad materials after they have been thor- 
oughly washed. The leaves of very curly lettuce frequently 
hold the water, even after shaking. Dry them with a soft piece 
of cheesecloth. If not dry, the dressing will not be evenly dis- 
tributed. 

Salads are digested largely in the small intestine. The oil 
contributes to the heat of the body ; the small amount of vinegar 
aids in the digestion of other materials. 



FRENCH DRESSING 

To make French dressing, rub the bottom of the bowl with a 
clove of garlic or onion. Put in a half teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of pepper, and add gradually, rubbing all the while, 
six tablespoonfuls of olive oil. When the salt is dissolved, add 
a tablespoonful of plain or tarragon vinegar, or lemon juice. 
Beat well for a moment and pour over the salad. Use at once. 
Worcestershire sauce, onion juice, or tomato catsup, may all be 
added in turn. Do not use all these seasonings at one time; 
by constant change a number of dressings may be made from 
a single recipe. Lemon juice may be substituted for vinegar in 
proportions of one tablespoonful to six tablespoonfuls of oil. 
Whenever the oil ''floats," too much vinegar has been added. 

If you are a diner you will of course object to mixing a 
French dressing in a bowl, and pouring it over the salad. The 
ideal method is to mix the dressing and salad by degrees. To 
do this easily, sprinkle over the salt and pepper, and pour over 
the desired quantity of oil ; turn or toss with the fork and spoon 
until each leaf is seasoned ; measure out the desired quantity of 
vinegar and pour it over the salad, and again toss and turn 
until the whole is evenly distributed. Serve at once. 

If the leaves of the lettuce are too large to serve, pull them 
apart with the fingers before pouring over the dressing. Under 



442 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

no circumstances must lettuce be cut with a knife. The old 
Spanish proverb most aptly describes the necessary character- 
istics of a salad maker : ''A spendthrift for oil, a miser for vine- 
gar, and a madman to stir it up." That means that the stirring 
must be quickly and deftly done. People with cultivated palates 
rarely eat things that are called sour. There must be just 
enough vinegar to cut the oil. 

ENGLISH SALAD DRESSING 

Put into a bowl a half teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of 
white pepper, a teaspoonful of pounded mint or mint sauce, 
a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, four tablespoonfuls of 
olive oil, and when well mixed add one tablespoonful of celer\' 
vinegar. Without this, add a saltspoonful of celery seed, and 
use plain vinegar. 

JAPANESE DRESSING 

Rub the bottom of the bowl with a clove of garlic, add a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a drop of tobasco oil, a half teaspoonful of 
soy and six tablespoonfuls of olive oil ; mix thoroughly and add 
one tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar. 

ITALIAN DRESSING 

Put into a bowl a half teaspoonful of salt, a clove of garlic 
mashed, a saltspoonful of white pepper, a teaspoonful of tomato 
paste, or tomato catsup ; rub thoroughly, and then stir in gradu- 
ally four tablespoonfuls of Italian olive oil ; add one tablespoon- 
ful of tarragon vinegar; beat thoroughly and pour it at once 
over the dinner salad. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Put the uncooked yolks of two eggs into a clean cold soup dish. 
Add a half teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of cayenne; work 
these well together, and then add drop by drop a half pint or 
more of olive oil. Stir rapidly and steadily while adding the 
oil. After adding one gill of oil, alternate occasionally with a 



SALADS 



443 



few drops of lemon juice or vinegar. The more oil you use, 
the thicker the dressing. If too thick, add a half tablespoonful 
►r more vinegar to reduce it to the proper consistency. More 
)r less oil may be added, according to the quantity of dressing 

ranted. With care a quart bottle of oil may be stirred into the 
^olks of two eggs, alternating with a few drops of lemon juice 
)r vinegar, after adding the first gill of oil. It is easier, how- 
;ver, to start with three yolks when making a quart of dressing. 
[n case the dressing should curdle, i. e., the egg and oil separate, 

rhich makes the dressing liquid, begin anev/ at once with the 
^olks of two eggs in another plate, and after stirring slightly, 
idd by teaspoonfuls the curdled mayonnaise, stirring all the 
[while, and then finish by adding more oil, as directed. 

In warm weather stand the dish in which you make the 

layonnaise on a piece of ice, or in a pan of ice water. Qiill 
ilso the oil and eggs. This dressing, if covered closely in a 
jar or tumbler, will keep in a cold place one week. 

Where a large quantity of mayonnaise is required, and 
expense must be taken into account, a little whipped cream 
Stirred in at the very last moment increases its bulk without 
liquefying or destroying the consistency of the dressing. Where 

le flavor of oil is not Hked, this softens the dressing, and makes 
it more palatable. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING, No. 2 

[any persons prefer one or two hard boiled eggs mixed with 
the uncooked eggs for ma3'onnaise dressing. Press the yolks 
►f two hard boiled eggs through a sieve ; rub them until per- 
fectly smooth, adding one at a time the yolks of two raw eggs ; 
idd a saltspoonful of salt and a dash of cayenne. Add, as in 
)receding recipe, drop by drop, as much olive oil as you desire, 
llternately with a drop or two of vinegar. Whipped cream 

lay also be added. 

WHITE DRESSING 

^rhis dressing is used for such salads as Waldorf or white grape, 
ind has no special virtue beyond its color. Select two light- 
polored yolks, drop them into a clean, cold bowl ; mix lightly ; 



444 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



<f 



add a half saltspoonful of salt, and begin to add, drop by drop, 
the oil as for mayonnaise dressing, using six tablespoonfuls. 
This dressing should be very thick. At the last add slowly^ 
almost drop by drop, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and then 
fold in six tablespoonfuls of cream whipped to a stiff froth; 
add, if you have it, a drop of spinach green. 

GREEN MAYONNAISE 

Make a plain mayonnaise dressing, and add to it just at serving 
time a tablespoonful of pounded parsley. Chop the parsley very 
fine and rub it to a paste in a mortar. If you are without a 
mortar, put it into a bowl and rub it with the back of the spoon. 

RED MAYONNAISE 

This is usually served with lobster salad, and is made red by 
the addition of the coral of the lobster, rubbed to a smooth paste. 
For other purposes, a tablespoonful of beet juice, or a drop of 
cochineal may be used. Colored foods, however, are more or 
less objectionable. 

MAYONNAISE WITH HORSERADISH 

Stir just at serving time four tablespoonfuls of fresh grated 
horseradish into a half pint of mayonnaise dressing. Serve as 
a dressing for cold boiled fish, or cold corned beef, or use it ||| 
with corned beef salad. ' 

ASPIC MAYONNAISE 

When mayonnaise dressing is to be used for garnishing it is 
as a rule pressed through a star tube in a pastry bag. The heat 
of the hand reduces the consistency of the mayonnaise, which 
makes it difficult to shape. To each gill or half cup add four 
tablespoonfuls, a drop at a time, of cool, not congealed, aspic, 
beating all the while. After the whole has slightly stiffened, 
stir in a little whipped cream. Use it as quickly as possible, 
or the heat of the hand will again soften it.

EGYPTIAN MAYONNAISE 

2 good-sized tomatoes 2 hard boiled yolks of eggs 

6 tablespoonfuls of oil i raw yolk 

I clove of garlic i drop of tobasco oil 

Yz teaspoonful of onion juice 

Peel the tomatoes ; cut them into halves and press out the seeds. 
Chop the solid, fleshy portion very fine, then press it through 
a coarse sieve. Drain, mash the yolks of the hard boiled eggs, 
add the yolk of the raw ^^'g, and rub to a perfectly smooth 
paste, and add, a drop at a time, the oil. When thick and 
smooth add the seasoning, and then work in the dry pulp of the 
tomato. This dressing is especially adapted to mutton salad. 

EAST INDIA DRESSING 

To mayonnaise dressing No. 2 add one teaspoonful of curry 
powder and a clove of garlic that has been mashed through a 
sieve. This dressing is used with broiled sardines, and is 
exceedingly nice with fish croquettes, or cold salmon. 

SPANISH DRESSING

the vinegar and tomato catsup. To remove the skin from the 
pepper throw it into a quick oven for a few moments, until the 
skin will easily peel off. 

This dressing may be used for tomato or beef salad. 



ANCHOVY DRESSING 

Add a teaspoonful of anchovy paste, or an anchovy rubbed to 
a paste, to the ordinary mayonnaise dressing. A tablespoonful 
of tomato catsup, a few drops of Worcestershire and a drop 
of tobasco will greatly improve the flavor.

GERMAN DRESSING 

^ pound of bacon 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar 

I onion I saltspoonful of pepper 

Put the bacon into a saute pan with a half cup of water ; let it 
boil until the water evaporates, and then "try" out all the fat. 
Then remove the bacon when it is dry and crisp. When the fat 
is cool, add to it the pepper and vinegar. Pour over sliced hot 
potatoes, or German salad, composed of chopped apples and 
potatoes.

Press the hard boiled yolks through a sieve ; then with a limber 
knife, rub them gradually to a smooth paste, adding the raw 
yolk, and then work in, as though you were making mayonnaise 
dressing, the cream or clarified butter. When sm.ooth and thick 
add the vinegar, salt and pepper. This is a very homely dress- 
ing, neither tasty to the delicate palate nor wholesome, and is 
only to be used in an emergency.

Put the milk in a double boiler over the fire. Separate the 
eggs. Moisten the cornstarch with a little cold milk; add it 
to the hot milk. When thick and smooth, stir in the yolks of 
the eggs well beaten. Cook just a moment ; take from the fire 
and pour while hot into the well beaten whites; add the salt, 
pepper, and, drop by drop, the vinegar. Lemon juice may be 
substituted for the vinegar. When the dressing is very cold, it

crisp cabbage or celery, or cabbage and celery mixed ; is pala- 
table but not so wholesome as a mayonnaise dressing. 



COOKED MAYONNAISE 

Put the yolks of four eggs into a saucepan; add four table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, four tablespoonfuls of water; beat for 
a moment. Stand the saucepan in a pan of boiling water and 
beat constantly and rapidly until the sauce is of the consistency 
of ordinary mayonnaise dressing. As soon as it begins to 
thicken, take it from the fire ; the heat of the saucepan will finish 
the cooking. It must not be curdled or lumpy. Pass this 
through a very fine sieve ; add gradually a tablespoonful of 
tarragon vinegar and a teaspoonful of onion juice. Stand aside 
until perfectly cold. When wanted for use, fold in a half cup 
of cream whipped to a stiff froth.

Distrust the condiment that bites too soon; 

Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault. 

To add a double quantity of salt. 

Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, 

And twice with vinegar procured from town; 

True taste requires it, and your poet begs, 

The pounded yellow of two well l)oiled eggs. 

Let onions' atoms lurk within the bowl, 

And scarce suspected animate the whole; 

And lastly, in the flavored compound toss 

A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce ; 

Oh, great and glorious! Oh, herbaceous meat! 

'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat; 

Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul, 

And dip his fingers in the salad bowl.

BOHEMIAN SALAD 

This is an exceedingly nice salad to serve with braised beef, 
or mutton. Cover the bottom of a salad dish with crisp lettuce 
leaves ; put over the top alternate slices of boiled beets and hard 
boiled eggs; sprinkle with a tablespoonful of chopped onion, 
and cover with Italian dressing.

cold water for a half hour. Cut into thin slices ; soak in fresh, 
very cold water for one hour ; drain, cover with French dressing 
and serve at once. 

Do not add salt to the water, but if convenient, add a piece 
of ice. Cucumbers wilted are perhaps the most indigestible of 
all vegetables. In a fresh, crisp condition, they are palatable 
and much more acceptable. 

CABBAGE SALAD 

Cut a hard head bi cabbage into halves, and then, with a very 
sharp knife, shred fine the desired quantity. As fast as it is 
shredded, throw it into a bowl of very cold or ice water. Let 
ii stand for two hours. It is improved by changing the water 
once or twice. When ready to serve, shake it until perfectly 
dry or drain it in a colander. Put it into a salad bowl, cover 
with French or Japanese dressing and mix thoroughly. This 
is one of the nicest of winter dinner salads. Celery or celery 
seed may be mixed with it if desired.

CAULIFLOWER SALAD 

Wash one head of cauliflower ; soak it in cold water for a half 
hour. Drain ; tie it in cheesecloth and drop it into a kettle of 
boiling, salted water, and simmer gently for thirty minutes. 
The cauliflower must not lose its color. Rapid boihng, or too 
long boiling will give it a pinkish cast. A cupful of milk 
added to the water in which the cauliflower is boiled will aid 
in keeping it white. When done, take it from the water; drain, 
break it apart in the flowerets; stand aside until very cold. 
When ready to serve, arrange these neatly in the salad bowl 
or round dish ; sprinkle over a little chopped parsley and baste 
with French or Japanese dressing. 

A COOKING SCHOOL SALAD 

I tart apple i pint of shredded cabbage

Shred and soak the cabbage. Peel the tomato, cut it into halves 
and press out the seeds, then chop it fine. Remove the seeds 
from the pepper and cut it into fine shreds. At serving time, 
drain and dry the cabbage. Pare and slice the apple. Put a 
layer of the cabbage in the bottom of the salad bowl, then a 
little apple, then a sprinkling of tomato, pepper and onion, then 
another layer of cabbage, and continue, having the last layer 
pepper. Baste carefully with the dressing and mix thoroughly. 

CELERY SALAD 

Wash and cut the desired amount of the inner part of the celery 
into slices ; soak it in cold water for thirty minutes ; drain and 
throw it on a towel, turning the towel from side to side until the 
celery is dry. Put it in a salad bowl and stand it in a cold place. 
At serving time, baste with French dressing. This is greatly 
improved by adding a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, soy 
or mushroom catsup.

A GROUP OF LUNCHEON. SUPPER. AND 
RECEPTION SALADS 

As a rule meat salads are best with mayonnaise, vegetables with 
French dressing. There are few exceptions. Mayonnaise is 
quite palatable with tomatoes and celery, although not consid- 
ered an elegant dinner salad, and French dressing is used over 
a few meat salads, especially with salted fish.

boil rapidly for five minutes; then push the kettle to the back 
part of the stove and cook at 180° Fahr., until the chicken is 
tender. If the cooking is carefully done the dark meat will be 
almost as white as the white meat. Remove the chicken, and 
when cold take off the skin. Take the flesh from the bones, 
rejecting the fat. Cut the meat into cubes of one inch. Meas- 
ure and allow an equal quantity of white celery cut into pieces 
of the same size. If the salad is not to be immediately served 
keep the celery in a cold place and the chicken in a separate 
bowl. When ready to serve, sprinkle the chicken with the 
lemon juice, dust with a teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful 
of paprika; then mix it with the celery and immediately add 
one-half the mayonnaise. Toss with two forks until each piece 
of the salad is covered with the mayonnaise. Turn it into the 
salad bowl, which has been neatly lined with crisp lettuce leaves ; 
put over the remaining portion of the mayonnaise, garnish with 
olives and the light tips of celery, and send at once to the table.

SALADS 



459 



There are many varieties of chicken salad which do not 
require separate recipes for the making. For instance, nuts 
may be added, and chicory or cabbage take the place of celery, 
where the latter cannot be obtained. If English walnuts are 
used blanch and remove the skins. Blanched almonds, pecan 
nuts, and pine or pifion nuts all make pleasant blendings. Use 
all nuts in the proportion of a half pint of chopped nuts to each 
quart of chicken blocks. In the summer when celery is not 
accessible, use to each quart of chicken a saltspoonful of celery 
seed and the nuts, and serve the salad on lettuce leaves. 

CHICKEN SALAD, No. 2 

I three and a half pound chicken 2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon 
3 anchovies, or a teaspoonful of vinegar 

anchovy paste i saltspoonful of white pepper 

I level teaspoonful of salt or paprika 

I pint of mayonnaise dressing 

Boil and cut the chicken as directed in preceding recipe. Cut 
the anchovies into strips and mix them with the chicken. If 
you use anchovy paste, mix it with the vinegar and pour it over 
the chicken. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and stand aside 
thirty minutes. When ready to serve, mix half the mayonnaise 
dressing with the chicken ; dish it on lettuce leaves, put over the 
remaining quantity of the dressing and garnish with a table- 
spoonful of capers.

gently for one hour. Cool quickly and pick them apart, reject- 
ing all the membrane. Sprinkle over the tarragon vinegar and 
celery seed. Make a "chapon," put it in the bottom of a bowl, 
garlic side up. Put the sweetbreads on top. Cover the bowl 
closely and stand aside over night. When the chicken is cold 
remove the skin and cut it into cubes of a half inch. Wash 
and dry, without browning, the pifion nuts. Blanch the 
almonds, dry and chop them fine. At serving time lift the 
sweetbreads carefully from the garlic, mix them with the 
chicken; sprinkle over the onion grated, soy, tobasco oil and 
the salt. Add the almonds and about a tablespoonful of lemon 
juice. Whip the cream to a very stiff froth, fold it, at the 
last moment, into the mayonnaise dressing and mix half of it 
with the chicken. Cover the serving dish with the crisp let- 
tuce leaves ; put the chicken in the centre and cover the top 
with the remaining mayonnaise. Garnish, if possible, with 
ripe olives and a half cup of dry pifion nuts. Reserve the 
**heart" of one head of lettuce for the centre of the dish. 
Chicken salad is much handsomer when garnished with differ- 
^ent shades of green. To intensify the pale yellow of the let- 
tuce and celery, put here and there a sprig of cress. This 
salad, like others, may be varied by changing the dressing or 
garnishing. For instance, sprinkle over the top in the place 
of nuts one chopped truffle or two ounces of fresh pistachio 
nuts chopped fine, or thin slices of canned chillies.

SALADS 461 

blanched, dried and chopped. Then add the salt, pepper, onion 
juice, lemon juice and mayonnaise. Put a tablespoon ful of 
granulated gelatin into a cup with two tablespoon fuls of cold 
water. Stir it and allow it to stand for about five minutes. 
Add a half cup of hot stock or water, and a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of beef extract. Stir for a moment and strain into the 
chicken mixture. When this is cool stir in the cream that has 
been whipped to a stiff froth. Put this in a large border mold, 
and stand on the ice for at least two hours. When ready to 
serve, cover a flat dish with crisp lettuce leaves. Dip the mold 
quickly into a pan of hot water ; loosen the salad from the edge 
and turn it out on the lettuce leaves. Have the celery cut and 
fringed. Mix it with a half pint of mayonnaise dressing and 
heap it in the centre of the mold. 

This salad, like many others, may be varied and made into 
endless varieties of cream of chicken salads. In the summer, 
for instance, after the mixture is a little cool put it into a pastry 
bag, using a star tube. Press out the mixture into great rosettes 
in the centre of a nest of tiny lettuce leaves. Pass with it may- 
onnaise dressing. Or you may press it from the pastry tube 
into peeled and scooped out tomatoes. Serve on lettuce leaves 
w'ith mayonnaise dressing. It is one of the most sightly and 
palatable of salads. At a reception where one wishes to serve 
a hot and cold dish on the same plate this salad may be pressed 
into little paper cases, the bottoms of which are covered with 
mayonnaise dressing; dust the top with finely chopped parsley 
or chopped ripe olives.

vinegar, chopped meat, salt and pepper. Form into balls, put 
them back into the whites ; take a cutting from the ends of the 
whites to make them stand. Put each in a little nest of crisp 
lettuce leaves ; garnish the dish with tips of cress and baste 
over French dressing. Serve at once.

chives 2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon 
Yz cup of mayonnaise dressing vinegar 

Put the eggs into warm water. Bring to boiling point and cook 
below the boiling point for thirty minutes. Throw them at once 
into cold water. Remove the shells and cut them into halves 
crosswise. Take out the yolks, mash them, add the chives, 
parsley, salt and pepper, and add gradually the vinegar. Cut 
a little slice from the end of each half of the ^^'g so that it 
will stand. Make the yolks into balls and fill the whites. 
Stand them in the centre of a round dish and garnish with the 
lettuce leaves. Put a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing on 
the top of each yolk, and send at once to the table. To make 
the dish still more sightly press the dressing through a star tube 
around the yolks on top of the white. To vary, after cutting 
the eggs into halves and removing the yolks, split the whites 
down so as to form daisies ; make the ball rather smaller, 
placing it in the centre of the white. Sprinkle loosely a little 
of the yolk around and place it in the centre of little nests of 
lettuce leaves. Pass the mayonnaise in a boat. 

EGG AND BEET SALAD 

I good-sized beet or several 6 eggs 

slices of pickled beet i saltspoonful of salt 

1/2 saltspoonful of pepper i lemon 

Chop the beet rather fine. Drop the eggs into a shallow pan of 
boiling water and poach them carefully. Lift them on a skiir.- 
mer, dish and sprinkle them with the lemon juice. Dust the

beets with salt and pepper. When ready to serve, put each tgg, 
which is now very cold and neatly trimmed, into the centre of 
a nest of lettuce leaves. Cover it with the chopped beet and put 
in the centre of a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing. Serve 
at once, with nut sandwiches, as a summer supper dish.

tablespoonful of capers 

pint of mayonnaise dressing 

Chop the beet and carrot rather fine. Hard boil the eggs. Rub 
the bottom of the salad bowl with a clove of garlic, then sprinkle 
it with two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Pick the leaves from 
the stems of half of the cress and chop them very, very fine. 
Chop the white portion of the celery equally fine and mix the 
two together. Dust them with salt and pepper, and work them 
gradually into the cold butter and form into balls the size of 
marbles. In the bowl put a layer of crisp lettuce leaves. 
Sprinkle a few leaves of cress over the top, then a sprinkling 
of carrot and beet, and then the game cut into pieces. Then a 
layer of the marbles of celery and cress ; another layer of carrot, 
beet and game, and cover the top with the little balls, leaving a 
space in the centre for the heart of the lettuce. Around the edge 
of the dish put a few lettuce leaves and sprinkle the capers over 
the top. Send to the table with a bowl of mayonnaise. 

After the dish has been exhibited — it is a very beautiful one 
to show — add the mayonnaise, mix lightly and serve.

add the onion, grated, and pour over while hot half the French 
dressing. Stand aside to cool. This salad, by the way, is never 
served ice cold, just cool. Garnish the dish with the crisp 
lettuce leaves. Turn the rice in the centre. Press into the rice 
the sardines that have been carefully drained from the oil ; or 
the marine herring, the backbone removed and the flesh of the 
fish cut into strips. Baste the rice and lettuce with the remain- 
ing dressing. Dust with chopped parsley and send at once to 
the table. In the spring the Japanese garnish this with chopped 
chives, in the winter with shreds of raw beet. To make these 
shreds, pare the beet and then cut it around and around as you 
pare an apple. Roll the strip back in the same form, like a 
compact beet, shave it down into shreds and soak in ice water 
for thirty minutes; drain, shake, and put them Hghtly over 
the rice. 

MUTTON SALAD 

Mix dice of cold boiled or roasted mutton with mayonnaise 
dressing; serve on lettuce leaves or with cress, and garnish 
with capers. 

Many prefer the English dressing, as it is flavoried with 
mint, which is always acceptable with mutton. 



POTATO SALAD 

4 good-sized potatoes The rule for French dressing 

I cold boiled beet or some i good-sized onion

German potatoes are best for this salad. 

Pare the potatoes ; throw them into boiling water. Cook care- 
fully until they are just done. While they are cooking make a 
French dressing in a good-sized bowl, and slice in it the onion. 
In the spring use scullions or Bermuda onions. As soon as the 
potatoes are tender, drain ; dust them with a teaspoon ful of salt 
and shake them over the fire until dry. Take one at a time, 
holding it in a napkin, and slice it in the dressing. When fin- 
ished, toss lightly without breaking the slices and stand aside

PARTRIDGE SALAD 

6 partridges The juice of half a lemon 

I onion 12 olives 

I tablespoonful of capers i tablespoonful of fresh tarra- 

I tumbler of currant jelly gon 

Singe, draw and roast the partridges. When they are cold, 
remove the skin ; take off the breasts, keeping the meat perfectly 
whole, making two pieces of each breast. Cut the onion into 
halves, rub the breasts ; put them in a dish, sprinkle with the 
juice of a lemon, and stand aside to cool. When ready to serve, 
dish each half neatly on a little nest of crisp lettuce leaves, or 
bleached chicory, and sprinkle thickly with chopped olives and 
tarragon. If you cannot get the tarragon use tarragon vinegar 
in the dressing. Add the capers to the dressing. Put a block 
of currant jelly in the centre of each breast and pour over either 
plain French dressing or Italian dressing flavored with a little 
anchovy paste. 

WALDORF SALAD 

The original was made by mixing thin slices of tart apple with 
white mayonnaise dressing. It is usually served without lettuce. 
It may, however, be served with both lettuce and celery. In 
many cases an equal quantity of apple and celery are mixed and 
served in the apple shells on lettuce leaves. With French dress- 
ing this is one of the most attractive and wholesome of dinner 
salads. 

SWEETBREAD SALAD

of an hour. When done, drain ; throw at once into cold water 
to quickly cool. Drain again and put aside until wanted. When 
ready to use, press the sweetbreads firmly under your hand and 
cut them into thin slices; remove all the membrane. Line the 
dish with lettuce leaves ; slice the onion ; place it on top of the 
lettuce, and on this the sweetbreads. The onion is not to be 
served, it is simply a flavoring. Sprinkle the sweetbreads with 
salt, pepper and vinegar. Let them stand in a cold place for 
twenty minutes. Cover with mayonnaise dressing and send at 
once to the table. A *'chapon" may be placed underneath the 
lettuce in the place of onions. 

Sweetbreads may also be cut into dice, mixed with mayon- 
naise dressing and served on lettuce leaves. Or cut into dice, 
mix with an equal quantity of pinon nuts or chopped canned 
mushrooms, serve on lettuce leaves, garnished with chopped 
truffle. 

TONGUE SALAD 

I pound of cold boiled tongue 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice 

I saltspoonful of white pepper Yz pint of mayonnaise dressing 

or paprika 2 heads of celery 

Yz pint of aspic jelly 

Cut the tongue into dice. Sprinkle it with the lemon juice and 
pepper. At serving time heap it in a small pyramid in the centre 
of a flat dish. Put around it at the base the celery cut into thin 
slices. Around the outside of the celery put a thick rope of 
mayonnaise dressing and chopped aspic. Then a rope of finely 
chopped beets, and, if you like, outside of this, finely chopped 
hard boiled yolks of eggs. Send at once to the table. 

This salad is capable of great diversity. The celery may be 
mixed with the tongue, and mayonnaise, or it may be served 
on lettuce leaves, garnished with a heavy rope of finely chopped 
aspic jelly, outside of which arrange a garnish of the tips of 
cress. 

TURKEY OR DUCK SALAD 
Turkey or duck salad may be made precisely the same as

I head of lettuce i clove of garlic 

I tablespoonful of chopped parsley 

Select small plump oysters. Drain, wash and throw them into 
a kettle, bring to boiling point and stir carefully until the gills 
are curled; then drain perfectly dry, saving this liquor to put 
aside for soup another day. Sprinkle the oysters with the vine- 
gar and paprika ; stand them on the ice until very cold. Cut the 
celery into pieces of one inch ; wash and dry. Make the mayon- 
naise and stand it aside. When ready to serve, line a round dish 
or salad bowl with the crisp lettuce leaves. Cut the garlic into 
slices, make a ''chapon," and put it underneath the lettuce.

fifteen or twenty minutes. Mince the celery,. using the tender top 
leaves, and put it over and around the oysters ; cover with the 
mayonnaise; dust thickly with chopped parsley and serve at 
once. This salad may also be made with French dressing, and 
may be made from pickled instead of the fresh oysters. Oyster 
crabs make a very pretty and attractive garnish, but are expen- 
sive. 

SALMON SALAD 

This salad may be made from either fresh or canned salmon. 
If fresh salmon is used, boil it carefully, pick it apart with a 
silver fork, rejecting the skin and bones. Allow it to get per- 
fectly cold. If canned salmon is used, it must be turned from 
the can, skin and bones removed, and the oil carefully drained 
away. In either case, arrange the fish on lettuce leaves, cover 
with mayonnaise dressing, and serve at once.

on top of which put a few fillets of anchovies, a little chopped 
white of hard boiled eggs, a little of the mixed vegetables, and 
a few slices of gherkins ; then the mushrooms, and then a layer 
of cold boiled fish ; then another layer of anchovy fillets, and 
arrange as before. Pour over the remaining quantity of aspic, 
which must be cold, not hard, and stand in a cold place over 
night for several hours. When ready to serve, dip the mold 
quickly into hot water ; turn out on crisp lettuce leaves ; make 
a hole in the centre of the mold by twirling around a table- 
spoon, taking out the piece, and fill the space with caviar ; gar- 
nish the dish with finely chopped onion and triangular pieces of 
buttered pumpernickel.

The rule for French dressing 

Add the tomato catsup to the French dressing. Hard boil the 
eggs. Take the yolks from the whites. Chop the whites fine, 
or put them through a vegetable press ; then put through the 
yolks, keeping them separate. Chop the onion very fine. Scrape 
the skin from the sardines ; cover them with vinegar, and let 
stand fifteen or twenty minutes. Empty the can of shrimps; 
wash and dry them. Sprinkle them with three or four table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. Cover a round plate near the edge with 
crisp lettuce leaves ; arrange on top the sardines, tails in ; inside 
of the sardines a row or a ring of shrimps, using the whole 
can ; inside of this a row of the white of the egg, then one of 
the yolks; fill the centre with chopped parsley, chopped gher- 
kins, a tablespoonful of capers, and baste the whole with French 
dressing; use at once. This is a nice dish for Sunday night's 
supper.

SALAD GARNISHINGS 

To fringe celery, cut the celery into pieces two inches long. 
Make parallel cuts on each end, then cut at right angles. Throw 
these bits into cold water for an hour to *'curl." Drain, and 
shake dry before using. 

Chapon. — This is a term used to designate a crust of bread 
into which you have pressed one or two cloves of garlic cut into 
slices. 

Coloring. — Every dish should be in harmony with the table 
decorations, and the garnishing in harmony with the salad, that 
the dish may not be conspicuous. For instance, chicken salad 
should be garnished with two shades of green, lettuce and cress, 
or olives. 

Carrots are beautiful for the garnishing of white salads and 
blend nicely with green. 

Garnish mutton salad with nasturtiums or mint ; use violets 
for cherry salad ; rose leaves for orange salad ; hard boiled eggs 
for cabbage salad. 

Radishes, chopped fine, garnish a dish of plain lettuce. 

Crawfish or shrimps are used as a garnish to lobster salad. 
Or rub the coral through a sieve and sprinkle it over the top of 
the mayonnaise. Oyster crabs are preferable for oyster salad. 

SALAD SEASONING 

Agreeable seasonings to be kept at hand for salad making: 
Garlic, mushroom catsup, tomato catsup, Worcestershire sauce, 
soy, tabasco oil, tarragon vinegar, mint sauce, capers and celery 
seed. All these can be purchased for one dollar and fifty cents 
and will last a year. 

SALAD ACCOMPANIMENTS 

A dinner salad usually follows immediately the meat course; 
pass with it a rich cheese, a toasted wafer, or a piece of toasted 
bread, or bread and butter ; or little strips of bread and butter 
put together like sandwiches, and piled, log-cabin fashion, on a 
dainty napkin in a little plate. 



SALADS 473 

\ Where there is only one maid, the waiting must necessarily 

i be limited. A cheese sandwich saves the passing of a second 

I dish; these or cheese fingers or cheese straws are served with 

I dinner salads. 

I A dinner salad may also be served with the game or second 

I meat course ; or at a family dinner in place of a green vegetable 

I with the meat. Then serve the cheese and wafers with the 
coffee. 

THE APPROPRIATE SANDWICHES 

Where salads are to be served for evening affairs, or wedding 
collations as the main course, pass with them appropriate sand- 
wiches. Brown bread sandwiches are especially adapted to fish 
salads, cold fish with mayonnaise dressing, or lobster or crab 
salads. 

,' Serve nasturtium and caper sandwiches with mutton salad, 

I nut sandwiches with chicken salad, chopped cress or parsley 

sandwiches with beef salad. 



CEREAL FOODS 

In this group will be found all foods made from the ordinary 
grains, the seeds of grasses, as wheat, oats, barley, rye and corn. 
As these seeds are the stored nourishment for the young plants, 
they are rich in nutritive materials, proteids, carbo-hydrates, fats 
and mineral matter. The principal carbo-hydrate is starch, which 
is from 65 to 70 per cent, of the entire grain. There is a very 
small quantity of sugar, and in the dry grains not more than 
10 to 12 per cent, of water. The mineral matter is principally 
lime and phosphoric acid, and is about 2 per cent, of the grain. 
Cellulose is found principally in the outer husk, which, in the 
process of manufacture, is removed, hence, the grains, if well 
cooked, are rather easy of digestion. Being largely starch, the 
primary digestion is in the mouth, but they are principally 
digested in the small intestine. All cereals, when well prepared 
and daintily served, are certainly attractive and wholesome. 
When eaten with fruit, or cream, milk, or eggs, they should 
form the greater part of food for men. The cheapness of pro- 
duction, and the wide area over which they can be produced, 
commend them to the masses. Compare for a moment the 
quantity of food that can be obtained from the grains, fruits 
and nuts, with the amount available from any other source, and 
you will find the advantage overwhelming in their favor. 

Weight for weight, not bulk for bulk, cereals must be 
counted as very nutritious foods. They are not difficult of 
digestion, provided they are well masticated. When swallowed 
quickly, as is frequently the habit with mushes, they offer 
greater resistance to the stomach than toast or breads. For 
this reason, toast and cream, or better, blocks of stale bread, 
with cream, are recommended as a good wholesome breakfast 
cereal for children.

BREAKFAST CEREALS OR MUSHES 

OATS {Avena sativa) 

The oat plant is hardier than wheat, and ripens in much colder 
climates. It is interesting to observe that oats growing in 
the north or cold climates are rich in fat, while rice grown in 
warm climates is deficient in fat. To keep up the bodily heat, 
fat is required, making oats a typical winter or cold-climate 
food, while rice is adapted to warm weather. 

Oats are rich in nitrogenous matter and mineral sub- 
stances, of which it loses less in the preparation than many 
of the other grains. Owing to the absence of glutin, oatmeal 
cannot be used for light-bread making unless it is mixed with 
wheat flour. It is made into thin cakes, called Irish oatcake 
or oatmeal wafers, which take the place of ordinary bread; 
but it is usually served in this country as a breakfast cereal, 
made into mush or porridge. 

One pound of oatmeal will yield twice as much muscle- 
building material as an equal quantity of bread. 

The American people are beginning to realize that oatmeal 
well cooked and served without sugar, is an admirable food 
for children as well as for adults. The age in which we live 
is a hurried one, and every saver of time is eagerly tried by 
the busy housewife. Thus it is that our cereal foods are 
frequently improperly cooked. The old fashioned ''steel cut" 
oats required ten hours for cooking; the first part of the 
preparation was done the day before it was to be served, or 
enough was cooked on one day to serve for two. It was pala- 
table, easily digested and assimilated, but required time and 
care for cooking. The American manufacturer, always ready 
to meet the demand of the housewife more than half way, 
conceived the idea that rolled oats would be more acceptable. 
Hence, the oats were steamed until slightly softened, then 
passed between rollers to make each grain perfectly flat or 
thin. In this way the heat penetrates more quickly to the 
centre of the grain ; it requires less time for cooking and is 
still fairly palatable. Under no circumstances should rolled 
oats, wheat or barley be eaten unless it has been cooked at 



CEREAL FOODS 477 

least one hour, better two. A singular thing, and one which 
I have never been able to understand, is that the housewife 
will spend hours in the preparation of a pudding, pie or cake, 
the artificial and useless foods, and leave the oatmeal or break- 
fast cereal, so much more important, to the "cook," who, per- 
haps, stirs it hastily in hot water and serves it up, after a 
few minutes' cooking, tasteless and pasty. This is the sort 
of oatmeal that must be covered with sugar and cream to 
make it palatable. 

Nor is it wise to use continually partly digested and pre- 
pared cereals, ''malted" or ''roasted" preparations. Starch 
is a natural food, and when the envelope is made soluble by 
long, slow cooking, the natural digestive ferments will produce 
the necessary maltose and dextrin. The artificial methods 
outside the body are seldom to be recommended ; the diges- 
tive organs lose their power if constantly interfered with, 
which makes it necessary to use "aids" to digestion. 

In cooking cereals, use freshly boiling water, not water 
that has been standing in the kettle over night, nor water that 
that has been boiled and allowed to cool. A double boiler 
will prevent scorching. Add salt to the water before putting 
in the cereal. 

Do not stir cereals while they are cooking or they will 
become soft, pasty and sticky. 

Left-over cereals may be used as an addition to muffins, 
or served cold with cream, or as thickening to soups. 

Stale, well baked bread, with cream, forms an excellent 
breakfast cereal, and one that requires mastication, which 
plays a very important part in digestion. 

OATMEAL MUSH 

6 tablespoonfuls of Scotch, i quart of water 

Irish, or steel cut oats i level teaspoonful of salt 

[Put the water in the upper part of a double boiler, put it 
directly over the fire, bring to boiling point ; add the salt, and 

[sprinkle in carefully the oatmeal; do not stir. Bring it again 
to boiling point, and put it at once into the under boiler which 



478 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

has been partly filled with boiling water; cover and cook con- 
tinuously for six hours. 

If this is to be served for breakfast and there is a hard- 
coal fire in the kitchen, make it the last thing at night, and 
place it where it will cook or keep very hot until morning. 
Where gas, wood or soft coal are used, cook it partly the day 
before. Put it over the fire while dinner and supper are 
being prepared, then lift the inner boiler and stand it in a 
cool place. Next morning sink it into the under boiler, which 
has been partly filled with boiling water, and heat without 
stirring. 

ROLLED OATMEAL 

This recipe will answer for all forms of rolled oats, as Quaker, 
Friends', Mother's, Hecker's oatmeal, and the "rolled" or 
''flaked," sold in bulk. 

Put one quart of boiling water into the upper part of a 
double boiler ; add a level teaspoonful of salt, and sprinkle 
in one pint of rolled oats. Put it in carefully, allowing each 
grain to fall separately; do not stir. Cover and stand in the 
under boiler, which is partly filled with boiling water. Boil 
continuously for one hour, better two. Turn carefully into 
the serving dish, and send to the table. 



OATMEAL FRUIT MERINGUE 

Left-over oatmeal may be turned in a round mold and placed 
at once to cool. When cold turn it out, and cut in slices a 
half inch thick; put one slice in a round dish, put a layer 
of berries or sliced peaches on it, and on top of this another 
slice of oatmeal. Beat the whites of four eggs until light. 
add four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and beat until 
fine and glossy. Spread this meringue over the top of the 
fruit, dust thickly with powdered sugar, and stand in the 
oven until a golden brown. Serve with cream as a luncheon 
pr supper dish, 



CEREAL FOODS 479 

OATMEAL GRUEL 

Sprinkle two tablespoonfiils of steel cut oats or groats into 
one pint of boiling water; boil rapidly for three-quarters of 
an hour. Strain into a bowl, add two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
and use warm. 

OATMEAL GRUEL, No. 2 

Put one tablespoonful of oatmeal into one quart of boiling 
water and boil one and a half hours. Take from the fire, 
strain it into a soup dish or bowl ; add a grating of nutmeg 
and four tablespoonfuls of cream. 

With a piece of bread nicely buttered, this makes an exceed- 
ingly good lunch for a child. 

OATMEAL GRUEL, No. 3 

4 tablespoonfuls of rolled oat- i saltspoonful of salt

Add the oatmeal and salt to the water, and boil directly over 
the fire for thirty minutes. Strain through a fine sieve, reheat, 
and pour, while hot, into the egg well beaten. Serve. 
Whipped cream may be substituted for the egg, 

OATMEAL TIMBALE 

Pour left-over oatmeal into timbale or custard cups ; when 
cold turn them out, scoop out the centres, leaving a wall a 
half inch thick. Fill the space with finely chopped, nicely 
seasoned meat. Place them in the oven until thoroughly hot : 
dish, pour around cream sauce, and send to the table. 

OATMEAL FRITTERS 

Put left-over oatmeal into a small mold and stand it away 
to harden. Turn it out, cut into slices a half inch thick and 
then into strips one inch wide ; dip in egg, roll in bread crumbs 
and fry in smoking hot fat. Drain on brown paper, dust 
with powdered sugar and serve.

BAKED APPLE WITH OATMEAL 

These are exceedingly nice to serve as a lunch to school 
children who come home after the family lunch is over. 

Core the apples, fill the space from which the core was 
taken with oatmeal porridge left over from breakfast. Stand 
the apples in a baking dish, sprinkle them with four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; add to the pan a half cup of water, and 
bake in a moderate oven until the apples are tender. Serve 
warm with cream, using a little more oatmeal as a garnish. 

OATMEAL BOUCHEES 

Pour left-over porridge in small custard cups and stand them 
aside to cool. When ready to serve, turn them out, scoop out 
the centre, fill with berries or sliced peaches, dust with 
powdered sugar, and serve with cream, milk or soft custard. 
Canned fruits may be substituted for the fresh. 

ROLLED OR FLAKED WHEAT 

Petti John's breakfast food is rolled wheat. A common rule 
for the cooking of rolled wheat will answer for all such 
preparations. 

WHEAT PORRIDGE 

I quart of water i pint of rolled wheat 

I teaspoonful of salt 

Add the salt to the water, and when boiling, sprinkle the 
rolled wheat in slowly so that every flake may be thoroughly 
scalded, stirring all the while. Boil rapidly fifteen minutes, 
and serve hot with cream or milk. 



CORN {Zea Mays) 

Considering the nutritious character of corn meal and the 
very low price at which it sells, it is by far the cheapest acces- 
sible food in this country. It will be noticed in the table of 



CEREAL FOODS 4«l 

comparative analysis that corn loses in the milling a large 
proportion of its fat. The oil of corn, a large percentage of 
which is in the germ, soon becomes rancid, imparting a musty 
odor and flavor to the meal. To prevent this the germ is 
removed in the milling. Corn meal is not so heating as whole 
corn. 

CORN MEAL MUSH 

I quart of water i teaspoonful of salt 

I pint of granulated corn meal 

Add the salt to the water, and when boiling, sprinkle in 
slowly the corn meal, stirring all the while ; take the corn 
meal in the hand and allow it to rmi slowly through the fingers, 
while you stir with the other hand. Boil rapidly for ten 
minutes, then push the kettle over a slow fire to cook for two 
hours. Serve warm with milk. 

FRIED MUSH 

Turn well cooked mush into a square bread pan to mold. 
When cold cut it into slices, dust them with flour, and saute 
them on one side until a nice brown ; then turn and brown 
the other. 

Suet is the best frying material for mush. 

MUSH FRITTERS 

Put one pint of milk in a double boiler ; when hot sprinkle in 
a half cup of granulated white meal. Cook, stirring con- 
stantly, for ten minutes ; then cover and cook slowly thirty 
minutes. Add a level teaspoonful of salt and turn into pound 
baking powder cans. Stand aside to cool ; when cold cut 
into slices a half inch thick, dip in Qgg, roll in bread crumbs 
and fry in hot fat. Serve at once.

Wash the grits through several cold waters; then pour over 
it the quart of cold water ; add the salt, and soak over night. 
Next morning cook in a double boiler for one hour. If too 
thick, thin with milk. Serve hot with cream or whole milk. 

Left-over grits may be warmed, seasoned with butter or 
cream, and served for supper. 

Cold, well boiled grits, nicely seasoned, make a good stuff- 
ing for tame duck.

BARLEY (Hordeum mil gar e) 

Barley when ground forms what is known as barley meal. 
Cleaned carefully, partly hulled and a little rounded by polish- 
ing, it is sold under the name of "pearl" barley. Flattened 
or rolled, it is known as barley flakes. 

The nitrogenous matter of barley is not rich in glutin, 
but consists principally of vegetable albumin and casein; like 
oatmeal it cannot be made into light bread. Barley cakes or 
bread consists of flattened cakes sometimes baked on the griddle, 
but frequently in the oven. They have the general appear- 
ance and flavor of the cassava bread of the West Indies. 

BARLEY WATER 

2 ounces of "pearl" barley 2 quarts of water 

Wash the barley through several cold waters, cover with 
boiling water and boil for five minutes ; drain and throw the 
water away. Add two quarts of boiling water, cover and 
boil gently for two hours. Strain and stand the water away 
to cool. This may be used as food for young children in the 
proportion of one-third barley water and two-thirds milk. 

BARLEY FLAKES 

Cook precisely the same as rolled oats. 



CEREAL FOODS 483 

RYE 

The common rye (Secale cereale) also belongs to the grasses, 
is quite hardy and is grown largely in this country. The 
nitrogenous principles are rather rich in glutin, making it 
a bread grain, ranking next to wheat. The bread, however, 
is darker and denser than ordinary wheat bread. Mixed with 
wheat flour it is much more palatable than when used alone. 

RYE MUSH 

I quart of water i level teaspoonful of salt 

About half a pint of rye meal 

Add the salt to the water, bring to boiUng point, sprinkle in 
carefully the rye meal, stirring all the while. Cover the sauce- 
pan, pushing it to the back of the stove, and cook slowly one 
hour. This should be the consistency of oatmeal breakfast 
porridge. 

If rye flour is substituted for rye meal, the mixture will 
be pasty. 

WHEAT GERM CEREALS 

We have in the market a long list of breakfast foods quite 
independent and different from the common cereals, of which 
Wheatlet, Wheatena, Farinose, Yuca, Germea, Wheat Germ, 
Vitos and the Ralston Breakfast Food, are types. These may be 
cooked after a common rule, and one may be substituted for 
the other. They are composed principally of wheat germ, 
mixed with farina or middlings. 

WHEATLET BREAKFAST PORRIDGE 

y2 pint of wheatlet i quart of boiling water 

I teaspoonful of salt 

Bring the water to a rapid boil directly over the fire, add the 
salt and sprinkle in the wheatlet, stirring all the while; stir 
and boil for about five minutes ; then stand it in a water 
bath, that is, another vessel of boiling water, and cook slowly 
for thirty to forty minutes. Serve with whole milk. 

Left-over wheatlet may be used the same as oatmeal or 
farina. 



484 MRS. RORER's new cook J500K 

MOLDED WHEATLET 

Cook the wheatlet according to preceding recipe; turn it into 
individual molds, and stand aside on the ice. Serve for 
breakfast with either plain or whipped cream. Or the centres 
may be scooped out, filled with fruit, and served with whipped 
cream as a breakfast or luncheon dish. 



WHEATLET SOUFFLE 

I pint of milk 4 eggs 

Yz cup of wheatlet ^ teaspoonful of salt 

Put the milk in a double boiler, when hot add the salt and 
sprinkle the wheatlet in slowly ; stir until smooth and slightly 
thickened. Add the yolks of the eggs, mix, and take from 
the fire; fold in the well beaten whites, turn into a baking 
dish, and bake in a moderate oven thirty to forty minutes. 
Serve with roasted beef in the place of Yorkshire pudding. 



DELICATE AND EASILY DIGESTED 

Cream of Wheat, farina and similar preparations are excellent 
summer foods. 

Farina is one of the most delicate of cereals for invalids 
and children ; it is more easily digested than the whole grains 
rolled. It does not, however, contain as much nourishment. 



FARINA PORRIDGE 

Put one quart of boiling water in a saucepan directly over 
the fire ; add a level teaspoonful of salt, and then sprinkle in 
slowly a half pint of farina, stirring all the while. Boil 
rapidly for ten minutes, then stand in a pan of boiling water, 
or in a double boiler, and cook twenty minutes long*er. 

Left-over farina may be cut into blocks, dipped in egg 
and bread crumbs, and fried; or may be used as a thickening 
for soups, or in timbales with fruit and cream.

GLUTEN FOODS 

These are made frorn the glutenous portions of wheat, and 
contain but little starch. Among those to be recommended 
are the Royal Health Food, Glutena and Gluten Breakfast 
Food. They are more quickly prepared than foods contain- 
ing starch. Being rich in proteids, they are better served with 
cream than milk. 

To each quart of rapidly boiling water allow a cupful of 
the gluten foods. Sprinkle the dry food in slowly, stirring 
all the while; cook thirty minutes, and serve hot with cream. 



COOKED, READY FOR SERVING 

We have an endless variety of the so-called prepared and 
partly prepared breakfast foods. Some are to be highly 
recommended ; others are inferior. Granose, Grape Nuts. 
malted biscuits, Force, and Norka are types and may be chosen 
in the order given. Simply warm or toast them for a few 
minutes in the oven to renew their crispness, and serve with 
fruit, fruit juice or cream. 



BR.£AD 

The use of bread, in every family in this country, three times a 
day, makes this one of the most important departments. Wheat 
occupying the most prominent place in bread making, will have 
our first consideration. Many varieties are grown, but, for our 
special purposes here, they will be considered as the hard spring 
and the winter wheats. The first is sown in the spring and 
harvested in the late summer ; the winter wheat is sown in the 
fall, sprouts, remains in the ground all winter, and is harvested 
about the same time as spring wheat. The winter wheats arc 
grown in warm climates ; the spring wheats in northern cold 
climates. 

With our present system of milling we are enabled to get 
from the hard spring wheat more gluten, muscle-building foods, 
than can be obtained from the soft winter wheats. As the price 
of flour is determined by the amount of gluten it contains, spring 
wheat flour is more expensive than the softer winter wheat 
flour. In the end, however, it is cheaper, as a given weight 
produces a greater quantity of bread. It holds more water 
and requires different handling, but makes bread making quite 
easy, compared to the old fashioned soft flours. 

Most of the better grades of bread flours in common use are 
blended spring and winter, and, provided the blending is largely 
spring, the mixture is desirable. Two common names are used 
to distinguish the spring and winter flour. Strong flour, that 
rich in gluten, is frequently sold under the name of Minnesota 
Patent ; the soft winter wheat flours, St. Louis Patent. In 
northern cities from Maine to Philadelphia, spring wheat, or a 
richly blended flour, is almost exclusively used for bread making. 
South, where hot breads are used daily, we find only the soft 
grades. While these are easily converted into hot bread, they 
cannot be made into good yeast **light" breads.

A good bread flour should be a rich, creamy yellow, rather 
coarse grained, so that it will fall apart, even after hard pressure 
in the hand. It cannot be packed. Soft winter flour should be 
a creamy yellow, soft under pressure, and easily packed in the 
hand. Genuine pastry flour is of a pale, yellowish white, fine, 
very starchy, and easily retains the form of the hand under 
pressure. This comes from the first and second boltings of 
either spring or winter wheat, usually winter. It is sold in car- 
tons under various fancy names, and is especially desirable for 
such delicate batters as sunshine cake, angel food, souffles and 
puff paste. In small communities where the genuine pastry 
flour is not attainable, use in its place a good quality of winter 
wheat flour. 

Avoid bluish white or grayish tinted flour; it is low-grade, 
and will make inferior bread. 

White flour is poorer in calcium phosphate than wheat itself. 
The housewife, after studying the table of comparative analysis, 
can decide for herself which flour is best for her family. The 
struggle for existence in these days is so keen, that many people 
recommend wheat bread on account of its easy digestibility, 
especially in families where large quantities of meat are used. 

"Whole wheat" flour is made from the whole wheat grain 
deprived of the outside bran and frequently the germ. It 
should be a rich dark brown in color, rather granulated or 
coarse. Good whole wheat flour contains all the albuminoids 
and the nutritive mineral matter of the wheat. In purchasing, 
select that free from large particles of bran. The outside husk 
is composed largely of cellulose, is indigestible and objection- 
able. If it becomes necessary to use bran now and then for 
medicinal purposes, to keep up the natural peristaltic conditions 
of the intestine, use Boston brown bread or a loaf of bran 
bread. Do not constantly mix bran with good whole wheat 
flour. Bread made from whole wheat flour is desirable for 
both adults and children, and is especially important to nursing 
mothers. It supplies the alkaline phosphates which contribute 
to the formation of the required salts in the body; and also 
contains the elements necessary for the building of bone and 
tooth structure. It may be possibly a little more difficult of 



BREAD 



489 



digestion than white bread, but one can certainly get more 
true food from the same quantity. 

Much of the Graham flour sold in our markets is composed 
of white flour, mixed with a goodly quantity of outside bran 
and a small portion of "shorts" or "middHng." These bran 
particles are indestructible in the digestive tract, hence, are 
irritating, and, if taken with other foods, hurry them through 
the intestines, without giving time for proper digestion or 
absorption. Bran bread or Graham is to be recommended in 
cases of constipation, but should be spread with a little nut 
butter and masticated thoroughly, and taken without other 
food as a night meal. Constant irritation of the intestine is not 
only unwise, but dangerous. Better by far stimulate the intes- 
tines, and bring about a healthy action, than to depend entirely 
upon local irritation. 

The **gluten" flour in the market is rich in albuminoids, but 
always contains a slight percentage of starch. By repeated 
experiments, I find that thoroughly washed dough, whereby 
all elements, except glutin are removed, is incapable of being 
made into light bread with the ordinary yeast plant. If a little 
sugar or starch is added, fermentation takes place at once. 

Different flour, even from the same mill, ground at the 
same grinding, will frequently require different quantities of 
liquid. Hence, in a recipe for bread, we give the exact amount 
of liquid and yeast, allowing more or less flour as required. A 
little practice will soon determine the quantity of flour needed, 
so that the housewife may always have bread of uniform 
quality. 

The Liquids used for bread making may be milk, water, 
half milk and half water, or whey. With our present system 
of milling, potatoes added to the sponge make an inferior 
quality of bread; and the water in which potatoes are boiled 
frequently contains a poisonous alkaloid, and should not be 
used for bread moistening. During the summer months, or 
where hard coal fires are kept over night, the liquids may be 
used cool, or just tepid, not over a temperature of ijo" 
Fahr. In winter, about 98° Fahr. To make good, whole- 
some sweet bread do not use such materials as lard, butter 



490 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

or sugar. If the yeast is of poor quality, that is, if you 
are doubtful about its activity, add a little sugar. Good bread 
cannot be made from poor yeast, but the sugar will aid the 
growth of the few living plants present, and make the bread 
a little more porous. It is the least of two evils. Such mate- 
rials as lard or butter retard the action of yeast, and prevent the 
bread from being sweet .and wholesome. Salt, in small quan- 
tities, acts as a ''guard keeper," holding the action of the yeast ; 
too much salt will overpower the yeast and make the bread 
heavy. Personally I use a little salt only in warm weather. 
Bread sponged over night with home-made or bakers' yeast 
is liable to sour in warm weather; hence, it is desirable to add 
salt, but where all the materials are of the best, salt is unneces- 
sary. 

YEAST (Saccharomyces) 

Yeasts are living plants belonging to the fungi, plants devoid 
of chlorophyll; the variety best adapted to bread making is 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The conditions of bread making are 
such that it is impossible to have an absolutely pure yeast. In 
the first place, neither the flour, the vessels in which the bread 
is made, the milk nor the water, is sterile, and the yeast has been 
handled; all these prevent a pure culture; and the wild yeasts 
and bacteria floating constantly in the air, mingle more or less 
with the bread sponge. In fact, there is made in this country a 
light bread called salt rising or ''emptyings" bread, in which the 
housewife depends entirely upon the wild yeast plants of the 
air and the accompanying bacteria. This is called "leaven" 
bread. The "leaven" is the salt-rising. Many persons have 
used this bread for years and still feel that it is preferable to 
yeast bread. Those who speak in its favor, are persons who 
have never studied bacteriology. It keeps moist (if moist 
breads are desirable, and I doubt it,) longer than yeast breads. 

Chemists have given, and are still giving, much time and 
thought to the cultivation of pure yeasts, and to the selections 
of varieties best adapted to beer and bread making. 

The German, or compressed yeasts, sold in almost every 
city and town, are fresh and active. Being compressed, each 



BREAD 



491 



cake contains much more true yeast in a small space, than can be 
obtained in dry cakes or home made yeast, which enables the 
busy housewife to make good bread quickly and easily. 

Allow only four hours from the beginning of the operation 
to the baking of the bread. Bread, quickly made, is sweet, light 
and sightly. When sponged at night, the temperature changes 
during the standing, and the conditions are not suited to the 
best growth of the yeast plant; such bread is apt to be of an 
inferior quality. 

As soon as the ** sponge" is made, the diastase begins at 
once to transform starch into sugar, upon which the yeast 
"feeds," decomposing it into alcohol and carbon dioxid. The 
bubbles, carbon dioxid, are held by the batter, giving the mass 
a light porous appearance. These, with the baking, are chemi- 
cal changes in bread making. The mixing, beating, kneading 
and molding, are purely mechanical. 

A perfect loaf should be light and porous, that the digestive 
secretions may penetrate easily, palatable, and still retain the 
nutritive principles of the wheat grain, well baked, to rupture 
the starch cells and to kill the yeast plant ; and the loaf should 
be sightly, with a crisp, thin, light brown crust. 

MANIPULATION 

Thoroughly mix the flour, liquid and yeast. This is best 
accomplished first by beating, then kneading. Each little grain 
of flour must be carefully surrounded by water to hydrate the 
starch, dissolve the natural sugar of the wheat, and moisten 
the glutin. This kneading makes the glutin elastic, and causes 
the constituents to adhere one to the other, forming a fine 
grained dough. In most households, I am very sorry to say, 
the hands are still used for the purpose of kneading. A knead- 
ing machine is much more hygienic. It is almost impossible 
to make the hands sterile, and at the same time safe for bread 
kneading. Materials for the thorough cleansing of the hands 
would be poisonous to the food. Small bread-kneading 
machines for family use can be purchased from $4.50 to $10, 
and are certainly desirable. 



492 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

The longer the batter is beaten, the less time is required fof 
kneading. When the dough becomes elastic and loses its sticki- 
ness, it is said to be sufficiently worked. The excellence of the 
bread, the shape of the loaf, the even distribution of the air 
cells, and the elasticity of the dough, depend upon the 
thoroughness of the kneading. 

The next operation, the molding, is of equal importance. 
After the dough is very Hght, it should be molded carefully. 
It does not require a second kneading. The molding is simply 
to shape it into loaves to fit the pans selected for the baking. 



BAKING 

The ideal loaf should not weigh over one and a half pounds 
when put in the pan ; the perfect bread pan is made of Russian 
iron, size, four inches at the top, three at the bottom, and nine 
inches long. 

The yeast plant is destroyed at a temperature of 212° 
Fahr. It is quite impossible to bring the centre of a large 
loaf of bread, even in a very hot oven, to this tempera- 
ture. For this reason, small loaves are preferable. Two loaves 
cannot be baked in the same pan to advantage. In breaking 
them apart, one side is exposed to the air without the covering 
of a crust. Under such circumstances the bread will dry 
quickly, or become tasteless or moldy ; the crust is a protec- 
tion. Plunge a thermometer into the centre of a large loaf, 
as you take it from the oven; it will in all probability register 
about 200° Fahr. Such bread is not thoroughly baked, and 
is unwholesome. Ordinary loaves should be placed in an 
oven at a temperature of 360° Fahr., and baked for 
three-quarters of an hour, cooling the oven to 300° Fahr. 
after twenty minutes' baking. With a register, the *'hand'' 
will point to eight for twenty minutes ; then cool to 
seven, and bake at this temperature for twenty minutes longer. 
Bake rolls and light biscuits in a quick oven, at a temperature 
of 400° Fahr. With a register, the "hand" will point to 
nine. All small breads should crust quickly ; then the tem- 
perature may be reduced about one-third. Be careful that the

oven Is not too hot at first, or the heavy crust will prevent the 
heat from penetrating the centre of the loaf, and the bread will 
be underdone. 

The rapid evaporation of water on the outside of the loaf 
during the process of baking, subjects the starch to a high heat, 
which changes it to dextrin ; the sugar at the same time is 
caramelized, and a sweet crust is formed. These same changes 
are observed in the second cooking of bread, of which zwieback, 
toast and pulled bread are examples. 

To test the oven without a thermometer, put a little flour on 
the bottom of the oven, and if it chars quickly it is too hot ; if 
it browns slowly, while you count forty (40 seconds), it is 
just hot enough for bread. Thermometers cost but $2.50, 
and relieve one of all anxiety and guesswork. 

TO KEEP 

As soon as the bread is taken from the oven, place it on a 
wire screen, or tip it on end, that the air may circulate freely 
around each loaf. Do not cover it even with a light cloth, as 
in this way moisture is held, which destroys the crispness of 
the crust and makes the crumb heavy. Bread keeps best when 
gradually cooled. Place, when perfectly cold, in a clean, light, 
cool, dry closet. Do not air the bread box after it has been 
scrubbed and scalded. Dry it over the fire, and close it to keep 
out the dust. Dust carries with it germs of mold, which grow 
rapidly upon the bread, spoiling its quality. 

DISEASES OF BREAD 

In spite of the utmost care on the part of the housewife, bread 
frequently becomes diseased from damp conditions and yeasts. 
These diseases are sometimes due to impurities in the flour. 
Mildew is perhaps one of the most common diseases of flour. 
Baking does not always kill the germs. Many diseases arise 
from fungous growths. One very common to whole wheat 
bread, in hot weather, develops first in the centre of the loaf, 
the mycelium sending out delicate branches throughout the 



494 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

whole loaf — a sort of cobweb condition. This bread is 
unwholesome and unpalatable. To remedy this, change the 
yeast and the place of keeping. When once the room in which 
the yeast is made becomes affected with this fungus, it is almost 
impossible to eradicate it. Molds undoubtedly produce 
derangements of the stomach, even after the bread has been 
toasted. There can be little doubt that all such breads, includ- 
ing the common sour or musty breads, are unwholesome, and 
should not be eaten. All these conditions are favored by damp- 
ness and darkness. For this reason do not wrap the bread, as 
the moisture of cotton or linen mildews it quickly, and contami- 
nates the bread. 

Observe scrupulous cleanliness. This injunction may be 
given in all household matters, as the same conditions which 
spoil bread also spoil the jellies and preserves. Scald out the 
bread pan each time before sponging the bread. Scald the 
board and wipe it, before kneading the bread. Put the bread 
into the bread riser, or cover it in a bread pan while it is stand- 
ing to rise. Bake it and take it to the cleanest and lightest closet 
to cool. Do not keep bread in stone or wood, nor in the cellar ; 
both flour and bread should be stored in dry places. 



HOME MADE YEAST 

Pare and grate four good-sized potatoes into one quart of boil- 
ing water, and boil five minutes, stirring constantly. When 
cool, add half a cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, 
and one compressed yeast cake dissolved in a half cup of 
cool water, or a half cup of yeast that you have saved from 
the previous brewing. Turn the mixture in a stone or glass 
jar, cover and stand in a warm place (68° Fahr.) for 
at least three hours, stirring down the mixture each time it 
comes to the top of the vessel. When fermentation has 
ceased, cover the jar closely and stand in a cool place to keep. 
Caution. — The yeast must not be allowed to fall ; it must 
be stirred down. It must be put into a cool place as soon as 
fermentation ceases. A large bottle is a good and convenient 
receptacle for keeping. Save a half cupful of this yeast to 



BREAD 



495 



Start the next brewing. It will keep in a cool place in the 
winter for three weeks, in the summer ten days to two weeks. 
A cupful of this yeast will make four loaves of bread, sponge 
made at night. 



TWENTIETH CENTURY BREAD 

This bread, of course, is made from whole wheat flour. The 
liquids used may be either milk, or milk and water, or all 
water. 

I pint of milk i pint of water 

I compressed yeast cake i level teaspoonful of salt 

Scald the milk, i8o° Fahr., being very careful not to allow 
it to boil. Scald and add the water. When the mixture is luke- 
warm, add the yeast, dissolved in four tablespoonfuls of cool 
steriHzed water, the salt, and then stir in sufficient whole wheat 
flour (about i quart) to make a stiff batter. Beat continuously 
for five minutes, lifting the dough into the air and folding it 
over. Remove the spoon and scrape down the sides of the bowl, 
cover with a cloth, or in a bread pan with the ordinary tin 
cover, and stand in a warm place (75° Fahr.), in winter for 
three hours, in summer for two and a half hours. By this 
time the mixture will be light and spongy. Stir in, slowly, 
sufficient whole wheat flour to make a dough. Turn this out 
on the bread board, which has been slightly dusted with flour, 
knead continuously until the dough is soft and elastic and has 
lost its stickiness. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 
four portions ; mold each into a loaf; put into greased square 
pans, cover, and stand in the same warm place one hour, 
or until the dough has doubled its bulk and feels very light 
when lifted. Brush the top carefully with warm water, using 
for the purpose the pastry brush, and place it in a moderately 
quick oven (360°) for three-quarters of an hour. When 
done, turn at once from the pans, resting the loaves so that 
the air will pass around them, and when perfectly cool, put 
them into a clean tin bread box. 

If homemade yeast is used, add a cupful, making the 



496 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

sponge at night; stand it in a warm place (about 60° Fahr.), 
from, say ten o'clock until five or six the next morning; add 
flour and knead it, and mold at once into loaves. The time for 
second standing must also be increased from one to two or 
three hours. 

WHITE BREAD 

I pint of milk i pint of water 

I compressed yeast cake i level teaspoonful of salt 

Scald the milk, add the water, and, when lukewarm, add the 
yeast cake, dissolved, and the salt; mix and add one quart of 
good strong flour ; beat five minutes ; then continue adding the 
flour, stirring all the while until you have the dough sufficiently 
thick for kneading. Dust the board with flour, turn out the 
dough, and knead thoroughly until it is soft and elastic and 
perfectly free from stickiness. Do not add too m.uch flour at a 
time; it is the kneading that removes the stickiness, not the 
flour. The bread is dry and tasteless where too much flour is 
added. The grain will be finer and the dough whiter and more 
elastic, if you devote the last five minutes to pounding with a 
good strong potato masher, or you may take the dough in your 
hand and drop it on the board. Put this back into the bowl or 
pan, cover and stand in a warm place (75° Fahr.) for three 
hours. Now turn it out on the board, and carefully cut it into 
four loaves. Mold each, put into greased pans, either the long 
French or the square pans, cover and stand aside one hour ; if in 
the square pans, bake in a moderately quick oven (indicator at 
eight) for about three-quarters of an hour ; if in the long French 
pans, in a quick oven (indicator at nine — temperature 400° 
Fahr.) for thirty minutes. 

Where homemade yeast is used, sponge must be made at 
night, using a half cupful of yeast. The dough must be 
kneaded early in the morning. 

GRAHAM BREAD 

To make one loaf of Graham bread, take one pint of whole 
wheat sponge when it is light and ready for kneading, add

to it a tablespoonful of molasses, and sufficient Graham flour 
to make a stiff batter. Beat thoroughly, turn into a square 
greased pan, and when it has doubled its bulk and is light in 
weight, bake it in a moderate oven (300° Fahr.) about three 
quarters of an hour. 

GLUTEN BREAD

Scald the milk, and when lukewarm, add the salt and yeast 
cake dissolved, and stir in slowly, beating all the while, one 
quart of gluten flour. Beat the whites of the eggs lightly, 
add them to the mixture, and then continue adding the gluten 
flour until it will drop rather than pour from the spoon. Beat 
thoroughly, and pour into three square greased bread pans, 
filling them about one-half full. Cover, and stand in a warm 
place until the pans are two-thirds full, and they feel light 
when lifted. Brush with water, and put into the oven at 
300° Fahr. Bake one hour. This bread should be rather 
fine grained, porous and, very sweet. If it seems sticky in 
the centre it has not been well baked, or it has been baked 
too quickly.

add a level teaspoonful of salt, and the yeast cake, dissolved 
in a quarter cupful of cool water. Beat into this the flour, 
cover and stand in a warm place (75° Fahr.) for three 
hours, until it has doubled its bulk, is light and porous.

Begin to add slowly sufficient white or whole wheat flour to 
make a dough that can be turned out on the board and 
kneaded thoroughly. The dough must become elastic and 
lose its stickiness. Cut into three loaves; mold, place them 
in greased square bread pans, cover, and stand in the same 
warm place for one and one-half hours, or again until very 
light and porous. Brush the top with water, and bake in a

minutes. Take it from the fire, add the milk, the salt, and, 
when lukewarm, the yeast cake, dissolved in a quarter cupful 
of cold water. Add slowly, stirring all the while, sufficient 
whole wheat flour to make a dough. This bread is better if 
a little moist. It must be stirred and beaten with a paddle, 
rather than kneaded on the board. When it is too stifif to drop 
from the spoon, scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover and 
stand in a warm place, 75° Fahr., for three hours. Then add 
just a little more flour, mix again, and pour into three greased 
square pans. Stand in the same warm place for one hour. 
Bake in a moderate oven (300° Fahr.), for three-quarters of 
an hour.

ing the dough, about five minutes longer. Form it into a 
large loaf, put it back into the bowl, and stand it in a warm 
place for one and a half hours, until it has doubled its bulk. 
When very light turn it out on a board, roll it to a sheet a 
half inch thick, cut it in small biscuits with a round cutter, 
place them in gem pans or shallow greased pans, sufficiently 
far apart not to touch in the baking. Cover and stand in a

two minutes before they are done, and again brush the tops 
with the water and white of egg. Put them back to glaze. 
These may be made into any of the numerous forms used 
by the Vienna bakers. 



POCKET-BOOK ROLLS 

ij4 quarts of bread flour 2 tablespoonfuls (two ounces) 

I pint of milk of butter 

I level teaspoonful of salt i yeast cake 

Put the milk in a double boiler over the fire, and when the 
water in the underneath part is boiling the milk is sufficiently 
scalded. Take it from the fire and stand aside to cool. Rub 
the butter thoroughly into the flour; add the salt. Make a 
good-sized well in the centre of the flour, dissolve the yeast 
cake in a half cupful of cool water, add it to the milk, and 
pour it in the centre of the well ; with your fingers dust the 
flour from the side of the bowl over the top of the milk. 
Cover the bowl and stand aside m a warm place (75° Fahr.) 
for three hours. Then stir in gradually all the flour. Take 
this rather soft dough out on the board, and knead contin- 
uously for fifteen minutes, in which time the dough will lose 
all its stickiness and become soft and elastic. If the proportions 
are right and the quality of the flour good, extra flour will not be 
required for kneading. Pound with a potato masher, folding 
the dough back as it flattens out. Roll in a sheet a half 
inch thick ; cut with a round cutter ; • with a knife handle, 
make a sort of hinge in the centre of each ; brush one-half 
with a little carefully melted butter, and fold over the other 
half, and just inside of the edge, press the two together. 
Stand these in a greased pan, sufficiently far apart not to 
touch when they are very light. Cover the pan, stand in the 
same warm place for one and a half hours, or until they are 
ven'^ light. Brush the tops lightly with milk, and bake in a 
quick oven (400° Fahr.) for twenty minutes.

BREAKFAST ROLLS 

I pint of water ^ of a compressed yeast cake 

1/2 teaspoonful of salt 

If these are to be served warm for breakfast, a portion of 
the manipulation must be done the night before. At seven 
o'clock dissolve the yeast in a quarter of a cup of cool water, 
add it to the warm water, add the salt and about one pint of 
good bread flour. Beat for five minutes, and stand aside in 
a cool place for three or four hours. At, say, ten or half 
past, add sufficient flour to make a dough. Knead thoroughly 
until it becomes elastic. Roll out in a sheet a half inch thick, 
cut with a round cutter, make a hinge as in the pocket-book 
rolls; brush one half lightly with butter, fold over the other. 
Press the two together, and stand in a greased baking pan 
ready tor baking. Cover these pans carefully with a bread 
cloth and stand in a cool place (about 55° Fahr.), the refrig- 
erator or cellar floor. In the morning brush the tops with 
milk, put them in a warm place ten minutes, until the oven 
is very hot (400° Fahr.). Bake twenty minutes. 

By experimenting I find that rolls are just as good when 
baked in the afternoon and re-heated in a quick oven in the 
morning. This saves considerable unnecessary work in the 
morning, and the rolls have gained by the second baking.

bread. Cover the bowl and stand in a warm place (75'' 
Fahr.) for three and a half hours. Then turn the dough 
out on a well floured board; roll it in a large thin sheet a 
half inch thick; cut with a crescent cutter, or a round cake 
cutter, using only one-half of it. Stand these in a greased 
baking pan sufficiently far apart not to touch in the baking; 
cover and put in a warm place for one hour, or until very 
light. Beat the white of an egg, the remaining tablespoonful 
of sugar with one tablesjx)onful of milk, until well mixed. 
Blanch, chop and dry the almonds. Bake the crescents in a 
very hot oven (400° Fahr.) for ten minutes; draw them 
quickly to the oven door and brush the tops with the egg 
mixture, sprinkle freely with the almonds. Put them back 
in the oven five minutes longer. These are exceedingly nice 
served without butter, with salad.

of butter i level teaspoonful of salt 

Put the milk into a double boiler; when hot, take from the

solved in a quarter of a cup of water, and the salt. Beat in 
gradually the flour. Cover and stand in a warm place for 
two hours, or until very light. Heat gradually a cake griddle ; 
grease lightly English muffin rings, and arrange them on 
the griddle. Fill each ring half full with the batter; cook 
slowly until they are sufficiently light to fill the rings. Then 
turn the whole with a cake turner, that is turn the muffin, 
ring and all ; cook slowly on the other side for a few minutes, 
and lift off the rings. Allow muffins to cook slowly ten 
minutes longer. These may be served warm, to those who 
can eat warm yeast breads; but they are much better pulled 
into halves, and toasted until crisp and brown. 



BREAD 606 

THE SECOND COOKING OF BREAD 

Under this heading will be found all forms of bread twice 
baked or toasted, such as zwieback, plain toast, water, milk 
or cream toast, pulled bread, and toast fingers. 

We make zwieback for two reasons. First, to harden 
the bread, making mastication necessary. The primary diges- 
tion of bread is in the mouth; hence, it must be thoroughly 
mixed with the saliva. Second, a portion of the starch has 
been converted into dextrin. Bread simply toasted on one 
side, ■ turned and quickly toasted on the other, leaving the 
soft crumb in the centre, buttered while hot, is perhaps the 
most indigestible and undesirable of bread foods. It forms 
a bolus in mastication, which resists the stomach actions. It 
passes into the small intestine unprepared, and is crowded 
on to clog the intestine, producing gas, flatulency and consti- 
pation. 

ZWIEBACK 

Cut bread or rusks in slices a half inch thick. Place them 
on paper, in a shallow baking pan ; stand in a mild oven 
(about 200° Fahr.) until thoroughly dry to the very centre. 
It is wise to leave the oven door open. If zwieback is browned 
too quickly on the outside, it does not readily become crisp. 
When dry, close the door, and slightly increase the heat, 
until each slice is a golden brown and dry to the centre. This 
will keep in a tin box in a dry, light closet for a month. 

DRY TOAST 

Cut from a one-day old loaf of bread slices a half inch 
thick. Put them on paper in the bottom of a baking pan in 
a moderate oven to dry. When dry, place them in a toaster 
and hold sufficiently far from the fire to slowly brown the 
outside without scorching. Send at once to the table. Butter 
while eating. Burned bread is objectionable, and has a bad 
flavor, no matter how much of the outside is scraped off. 



606 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

WATER TOAST 

is made by dipping dry toast quickly into a dish of boiling 
water; spread it with butter, and send it at once to the tabic. 

MILK TOAST 

is made by pouring scalding hot milk over dry toast. A table- 
spoonful of butter may be added to each quart of milk. To 
prevent scorching, heat the milk in a double boiler. 

Caution. — The main point is to pour the milk over the 
crisp warm toast at the very last moment, and serve quickly. 

CREAM TOAST 

Put one quart of milk in a double boiler. When hot, add one 
tablespoonful of cornstarch, moistened in three tablespoon- 
fuls of cold milk. Cook, and stir until it is the consistency 
of cream; add one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of 
butter, and pour it at once over warm toast. 

BREAD FINGERS 

Cut the bread in slices lengthwise of the loaf. Trim off the 
crusts, and cut each slice into strips one inch wide and five 
inches long. Dry and toast the same as zwieback. They are 
usually served with soup or salad. 

PULLED BREAD 

The bread must be very light, thoroughly baked and perfectly 
cool before puUing. French bread is best. Whittle off the 
outside crust, then with two forks pick or pull the loaves 
into halves. Divide each half into quarters, and the quarters 
into eighths. Place these strips, ragged edges upward, in a 
long shallow baking pan that has been lined with soft brown 
paper. Stand the pan in the oven, leave the door open until 
each strip is dry to the centre. Close the door, slowly increase 
the heat, and bake until the pieces are a golden brown and 
crisp. This may be kept the same as zwieback. After the 
first day, re-heat at serving time. 



BREAD 507 

BAKING POWDER BREADS 

During the fermentation, in the process of wine making, an 
acid material settles, in the form of a crust or scales, on the 
sides and bottoms of the casks. It is this material, known 
as argols, from which cream of tartar and tartaric acid are 
made. The argols are carefully washed, dissolved in boiling 
water and drawn off into copper tanks. As the solution cools, 
a thick crust forms over the entire surface, which is taken 
off like cream from the surface of milk; hence, the name, 
*'cream" of the tartar. It is then re-dissolved, purified, filtered, 
again crystallized, powdered, and sold under the name of 
''cream of tartar." 

In the liquid remaining after the "cream" has been taken 
from the surface, is the tartaric acid, a much stronger acid 
than the first. Cream of tartar is frequently adulterated with 
starch, alum and other materials, which accounts for the failure 
of "homemade baking powders." The best commercial pow- 
ders are, as a rule, well made and free from adulterations ; being 
thoroughly mixed and blended by several boltings, they give 
much better results than cream of tartar and soda hastily put 
together by an amateur. 

All baking powders used for bread making yield neutral 
salts, a portion of which remains in the dough. For this 
reason, great care must be taken to get the right proportion 
of soda and acid, to form as little residue as possible. 

The acid materials most commonly used for baking 
powders are cream of tartar, tartaric acid and acid phosphates. 
The alkaline material is universally bi-carbonate of soda. In 
some sections of New England, packages marked saleratus 
(potassium bi-carbonate) are still sold, but all the samples 
purchased under this name were found to be bi-carbonate 
of soda. 

The true value of baking powder depends upon the 
amount of gas liberated in the dough. Tartaric compounds 
are expensive, and this induces many housewives to take 
the cheaper substitutes, usually "alum" powders, which 
are possibly injurious; the salts formed by the decomposition 



608 MRS. uorek's new cook book 

of bi-carbonatc of soda and alum, are not readily absorbed. 
All good baking powders contain a small amount of dry 
starch, as fine flour or cornstarch, which prevents the active 
ingredients from becoming moist after the box has been 
opened. 

''Unfilled" powders, those free from starch, lose their 
activity after being exposed to the atmosphere. The term 
"baking powder" is usually applied to the dry mixture sold 
in boxes or bottles. 

Here, however, they will be considered from a much 
broader standpoint. For instance, a mixture of soda with 
sour milk or molasses, or soda and vinegar, or lemon juice; 
all of these mixtures are capable of giving off carbon dioxid, 
and have a "leavening" power. 

Our grandmothers used a saltspoonful of bi-carbonate of 
soda with half an ounce of vinegar, as a leavening to ordi- 
nary cakes. Lemon juice will answer the same purpose. All 
liquid mixtures, however, require deft manipulation, as the 
gas is evolved so quickly, when the two ingredients come 
together, that much of the lightness is lost unless they are 
at once mixed with the batter. For this reason dry powders give 
the best results. A level teaspoonful of soda added to a pint of 
New Orleans or Porto Rico molasses, will evolve sufficient gas 
to lighten a good sized cake. Cream of tartar and soda, when 
mixed with dough, act more deliberately than tartaric acid 
and soda ; but with all these materials work rapidly and bake 
quickly to get a light, fine grained dough. 

To prevent mishaps, many housewives make whole wheat 
bread with baking powder instead of yeast. This robs it of 
the tendency to become sour and sodden ; in fact, it will keep 
in a good condition as long as white bread. The baking 
powder loaf is porous and sweet. Carbon dioxid is evolved 
the same as with yeast; but one of the functions of yeast 
during fermentation is to act on the albuminoids, and, to a 
certain extent, on the starch, the result of which imparts to 
the bread a peculiar, characteristic flavor that cannot be 
obtained by the use of baking powder. 

When cream of tartar and soda are to be substituted for 



BREAD 



509 



baking powder, allow one level teaspoon ful of soda to three 
level teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, in the place of two 
rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Mix and sift with 
the iiour the same as baking powder. 

Use baking powder breads warm, yeast breads cold. 



TARTARIC ACID POWDER 

Three-quarters of a pound of tartaric acid, one pound of bi- 
carbonate of soda, six ounces of fine flour or cornstarch. Mix 
thoroughly and bolt or sift five or six times. Put into jars, 
cans or bottles, and cover closely. 



CREAM OF TARTAR POWDER 

One pound of bi-carbonate of soda, two pounds of pure cream 
of tartar, ten ounces of starch, flour or cornstarch. Mix, 
sift or bolt five or six times. Put into cans or jars, and fasten 
on cover tightly.

These are also called soda or baking powder biscuits. 

1 quart of flour i teaspoonful of salt 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking pow- i tablespoonful (one ounce) of

Add the baking powder and salt to the flour, and sift twice. 
Rub in the shortening, which may be butter, cocoanut butter, 
olive oil, or lard and suet ; olive oil, perhaps, is the most 
desirable. If cooking fats, such as cottolene or cotto-suet 
are used, a level tablespoonful will take the place of the 
rounding tablespoonful of the shortenings mentioned. Now 
see that the oven is very hot. Get the pans ready ; dust the 
bottoms with flour, or grease them lightly. Add gradually the 
milk, mix quickly. Turn the dough on a floured baking board, 
knead lightly and quickly, roll out in a sheet a half inch

cuits in the baking pan sufficiently far apart not to touch in 
the baking. Brush the tops with milk, and bake in a quick 
oven (400° Fahr.) for fifteen or twenty minutes. If well 
made and well baked, they will be brown top and bottom, 
thoroughly cooked and light colored on the sides. They will 
swell four times their original bulk. 

Whole Wheat, Graham, or Rye Biscuits, are made pre- 
cisely the same.

gradually to the flour. The dough must be soft, but not too w^et. 
Turn it out quickly, roll into a sheet a half inch in thickness, cut 
with a large round cutter. Dip a knife handle into flour, press 
down in the centre of each biscuit, making a sort of hinge ; brush 
with half melted butter, fold over the layer, and press lightly 
together. Stand in a greased shallow pan sufficiently far apart 
not to touch in the cooking. Brush the tops with milk, and 
bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. 



FIG TURNOVERS 

Make precisely the same as t.^'g rolls, using whole wheat 
flour. Have ready eight or ten pulled figs chopped fine. 
After making the hinge, put a tablespoonful of the fig mix- 
ture on half the roll, brush inside the edge with white of t.g'g, 
fold over the other half, press the two together, brush with 
milk, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. Serve warm

bake on a greased griddle fifteen minutes. Heat the griddle 
gradually and put it to one side of the stove where the scones 
will bake slowly. If sticky you have not added sufficient 
flour ; if dry, too much. Be careful not to add too much flour, 
or the scones will not be light. If too thin to roll, drop them by 
spoonfuls on the griddle.

This recipe may be used for all forms of breakfast muffins, 
keeping the proportions precisely the same. Where the batter 
must stand a few minutes before baking, it is wise to add the 
flour, beat thoroughly and stir in the baking powder alone

all the while, until you have a hard, almost dry dough. It 
may not take the entire quantity of moisture; for this reason 
add it gradually. Put the dough out on a floured board, and 
knead continuously for fifteen minutes, until it is soft and 
elastic. Then beat it, constantly folding, for twenty minutes

The sides of these biscuits should be white but cooked, the 
tops and bottoms brown. 

If well made and well baked, these are easily digested 
and palatable. If uncooked in the centre, "slack baked," 
they are very objectionable.

NUTS 



The word nut is used to express fruits of trees, enclosed in hard, 
woody covers, which remain closed even after the fruit is ripe. 
In some, the fruit is drupaceous. Of the almond, for instance, 
a drupe, we eat the stone kernel, and reject the pulpy covering; 
of the peach, a drupe of the same family, we eat the fleshy cov- 
ering, and cast away the seed or stone with its kernel ; the one 
we call a nut, and the other a fruit. 

Nuts and fruits furnish the principal food for the inhab- 
itants of many countries, and were, no doubt, the food of primi- 
tive peoples. To the vegetarian they are indispensable ; they 
furnish his meat, milk and butter. They are palatable, nutri- 
tious, and, if well prepared, easy of digestion. Being of vege- 
table origin, they are free from the danger of disease germs. 
Their food value is frequently overlooked by Americans, as they 
are generally served as a dessert. Under such circumstances, 
they naturally disagree, as one is adding concentrated, highly 
nutritious food to a heavy dinner. Then, too, Americans eat 
rapidly and masticate imperfectly. Nuts of all foods require 
most thorough mastication ; in fact, grinding is to be preferred. 

From the general awakening in regard to healthful diet, 
societies have sprung up all over the world, recommending the 
use of vegetable foods, especially fruits and nuts. We have 
well established, both in New York and London, large vegeta- 
rian societies, many with separate branches of "fruit and nut 
eaters." Personally I have tried the experiment, and find it most 
satisfactory. The difficulty is, one must always eat at home. 
The untrained cook does not understand "delicate feasting." 
Nuts must be carefully prepared, and fruits correctly chilled and 
daintily served. 

Like all other foods, nuts are divided into three classes : 
Nitrogenous, carbonaceous and the inorganic, water and min- 
eral matter. In the first group, 'those containing nitrogen, 

622 



NUTS 623 

which builds the tissues of the body, are peanuts, pecans, Eng- 
lish walnuts, hazel, filberts or cobnuts, almonds, pistachio nuts, 
pinon and hickory nuts in general. Black walnuts, butter-nuts, 
Brazil nuts, souari and cocoanuts are oleaginous (rich in oil), 
heat and energy producers. The chestnut and the chinquapin 
are the only starchy nuts in common use ; hence must always be 
cooked when used as food for man. The almonds, pine or 
pinon and peanuts, widely used in all countries, contain all 
three elements in goodly proportions. Pine-nuts are cheap, 
easily digested and nutritious. The high price of almonds 
places them among the luxuries, appetizers, digesters and 
flavorings. A few almonds, carefully blanched and dried, not 
cooked or fried, well masticated, at the end of a dinner, aid 
digestion. 

The common acorns are of many varieties, and are exten- 
sively used by the Indians in the West and Southwest; they 
are dried, ground and made into bread, which, when properly 
cooked, is palatable, and furnishes the only bread used by many 
of the tribes during certain seasons of the year. 

ALMOND (Prunus Amygdalus, Baill.) 

The almond is the seed of a tropical evergreen, widely cultivated 
throughout the warmer climates of the Old World, and is now 
being cultivated to some extent in Southern California. It 
belongs to that group of the great rose family, which also 
includes the peach and plum. The fruit of the almond appears in 
a soft, pulpy envelope covered with a rather woolly or soft skin, 
the same as the peach. The pulpy envelope, however, soon 
becomes dry, and when the fruit matures, cracks open, allowing 
the pits to fall to the ground. The trees differ in size, color of 
blossoms, and in shape and size of the leaf. The peach has 
rather a small pink blossom, while that of the almond is larger 
and of a pale rose color. Both appear in the early spring before 
the unfolding of the leaves. 

The almond is one of the oldest of nuts. A history of plants, 
three hundred years before the Christian era, mentions the 
almond as the only tree producing flowers before leaves. There 



524 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



are many varieties of almond, but for our purpose, two only 
need be considered — the sweet and the bitter almond. 

The sweet almonds are known as "paper shell," "hard" and 
"Jordan." The Jordan almond comes from Malaga, not from 
the Valley of the Jordan, as is usually supposed. They are 
always sold in our markets shelled; are large, sweet and the 
most expensive, and perhaps the most desirable of all varieties. 
The "paper shell" and most of the bitter almonds come from 
Valencia. The bitter brown skin underneath the shell, covering 
the kernel, contains tannic acid ; hence must be removed before 
the nut is eaten. The bitter almond contains a bitter substance, 
amygdalin, which, under the influence of the enzyme, emiilsin, 
in the presence of water, produces poisonous compounds, of 
which hydrocyanic or prussic acid is the chief constituent. 
Hence, bitter almonds must be used most carefully, in very 
small quantities, simply as a flavoring. Even then, I doubt if it 
is wise to use poisonous material. 

The kernel of the peach stone corresponds very nearly to the 
bitter almond, which makes it equally dangerous to use as a 
flavoring. The sweet almond contains emulsin, but not suffi- 
cient amygdalin to be, in the slightest degree, poisonous. 

Many products of economic value are made from almonds, 
among which are almond oil, a sweet, bland, non-irritating oil, 
and almond meal. 

Almonds rank high in nitrogen, containing from twenty- 
four to twenty-five per cent., and when dry, as w^e use them in 
this country, are much more concentrated. Frequently dry 
almonds contain as high as eighty-five to eighty-seven per cent. 
In European countries, fresh almonds, with cream cheese, and 
wafers or bread, are served as the last course at lunch ; in this 
condition they are most attractive, palatable and far less con 
centrated than when dried and toasted.

SALTED ALMONDS 

Shell the almonds, cover them with boiling water, and let them 
stand a few moments until the brown skins will easily rub off. 
This may be done by pulping, or by rubbing them between coarse 
towels. Put the almonds in a pan, dust lightly with fine salt, 
and shake carefully in a ifioderate oven until they are crisp and 
slightly browned. Do not use fat or oil of any kind, as it 
destroys the delicate flavor of the almond. 

Sugared Almonds are dusted lightly with fine sugar and 
toasted in the same way. 

ALMOND BUTTER 

Shell the almonds, throw them into a kettle, cover with boiling 
water and allow to stand just a moment ; then rub off the brown 
skins. Be careful, however, not to crush or break the almonds. 
Put them in thin layers in baking pans and then in a moderate 
oven to dry ; be very careful not to overheat or brown. Grind 
at once, and you will have almond butter. Almond butter is 
very palatable, and more economical when diluted with an equal 
quantity of pine-nuts. Grind them together. 

ALMOND WAFERS 

These wafers are used largely by diabetic patients.

Bran 

Mix thoroughly and stir in sufficient bran, about one quart, 
to make a hard dough. Roll this out into a very thin sheet ; cut 
into squares of two inches, and bake in a very moderate oven 
until a golden brown. The bran must be sifted free from all 
flour. 

BEECH NUT {Fagus ferruginea, Alton) 

These tiny, three-sided nuts are sweet and tender ; the size and 
scarcity, however, make them quite unknown to the average 



626 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

American housewife. Beechnut oil is used in many European 
countries in place of olive oil for salads and frying purposes. In 
case of scarcity of food one probably would turn to beechnuts if 
other foods were not at hand; but, as a rule, they are allowed 
to remain on the ground, and are generally eaten by the animals. 
Beechnut hams and beechnut bacon are said to have an especially 
fine flavor. 

BRAZIL NUT (BerthoUetia excelsa) 

These nuts consist of a number of oblong three-sided nuts 
encased in a very hard capsule or shell about the size of a man's 
fist, and in appearance are like a huge black walnut. The kernel 
of the nut is very rich in oil, in fact to most persons this nut is 
known as cream-nut; sometimes it is called butter-nut, but it 
must not be confounded with the ordinary white walnut or 
butter-nut of this country. The Brazil nut furnishes the prin- 
cipal food for the natives of Para and French Guiana ; in fact, 
in many localities they are known as Para nuts. 

A handful of Brazil nuts softens and improves all nut but- 
ters. Ground and pressed, they yield a sweet oil, exceedingly 
palatable on fruit salads. The brown, rather thick covering 
underneath the shell must be pared off before using the nuts. 
As these nuts are rich in oil and come to us in a rather fresh 
condition, they must be kept in a cold place, or they soon become 
rancid. 

BRAZIL NUT BUTTER 

These nuts being very rich in fatty .matter make the best of all 
nut butters. They cannot be blanched. With a very sharp, thin 
knife trim off all the brown skins, being careful not to soil the 
nuts. Cut them into slices, grind, pack in glasses, cover, and 
keep in a cold place. 

CHESTNUT 

The chestnut is the seed of a large tree belonging to the oak 
family and to the division Castanea. The small chestnuts with 
which we are familiar are Casfanea, variety Americana (Wal- 
son). These, with the chinquapin, Castanea pumila, are the 



NUTS 527 

only starchy nuts in common use. In a nut diet, they are 
ranked as cereals or breadstuffs. The European Castanea 
sativa and Japanese chestnuts are of many varieties, and are 
larger than those grown in America. All chestnuts must be 
cooked to be easy of digestion. 

Chestnut cakes, muffins or griddle breads are palatable and 
wholesome. In Europe, the raw chestnuts are dried and 
ground, and the product is sold as chestnut flour or meal. This 
contains about twenty-nine per cent, starch and seventeen per 
cent, sugar. The latter, no doubt, is produced during the ripen- 
ing of the nut. 

Chestnuts may be substituted in bills of fare for rice or 
potatoes. 

BOILED CHESTNUTS 

To eat chestnuts as a relish of an evening, or for Hallowe'en, 
throw them into a kettle of boiling water and add one teaspoon- 
ful of salt to each pint of chestnuts. Boil rapidly for twenty 
minutes. Drain in a colander, and serve smoking hot. 

To Serve as a Vegetable in the place of potatoes, remove 
the shell and the brown skin underneath. Throw the chestnuts 
into boiling water, and boil rapidly for twenty minutes or until 
they are perfectly tender; drain; season lightly with salt and 
shake them over the fire until they are dry and mealy. Serve 
plain or with cream sauce. 

CHESTNUT a la POULETTE 

Shell and remove the brown skin from one quart of chestnuts : 
cover them with boiling stock, add a saltspoonful of celery seed, 
a bay leaf and a thin slice of onion ; cover the saucepan and boil 
rapidly for twenty minutes ; drain, saving the stock. Rub 
together one tablcspoonful of butter and one of flour ; add one- 
half pint of stock ; stir until boiling and take from the fire. Add 
a half teaspoon ful of salt, a dash of pepper and the yolk of one 
egg beaten with two tablespoon fuls of cream. Return the 
saucepan to the fire for just a minute; be careful not to boil, or 
the egg will curdle. Dish the chestnuts, pour over the sauce, 
and send at once to the table. 



S28 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

ROASTED CHESTNUTS 

Make a cross through the shell on the flat side of the chestnut. 
Put them into a baking pan and shake constantly over the hot 
fire until the shells split. This will take from fifteen to twenty 
minutes. Serve hot. 

Chestnuts, like all other starchy vegetables, become heavy 
if they stand after cooking. 

CHESTNUTS WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Boil the chestnuts, and when perfectly tender press them 
through a colander in the centre of a large chop plate. Dust 
them thickly with powdered sugar and heap around one pint of 
cream, whipped to a stiff froth. The cream may be flavored 
with sherry or vanilla. 

CHESTNUT MUFFINS 

Roil one quart of chestnuts. Open the shells and take out the 
well cooked kernel ; press them at once through a colander, add 
a level teaspoonful of salt, the yolks of two eggs beaten with 
a half cup of milk, and a half cup of flour, sifted, with a 
teaspoonful of baking powder. Fold in the well beaten whites 
of the eggs. Bake in twelve hot greased gem pans. 



CHESTNUT CAKES 

Boil one quart of chestnuts. When done, open the shells and 
scoop out the inside, and add a half teaspoonful of salt, a half 
cupful of milk and two eggs well beaten. Mix thoroughly, and 
then stir in six tablespoonfuls of pastry flour. Drop by spoon- 
fuls on lightly greased griddle. When brown on one side, turn 
and brown the other. Cook slowly. These are the most whole- 
some of all griddle cakes, as the chestnuts are thoroughly boiled 
and there is not sufficient flour to make the baking difficult.

CHESTNUT GRIDDLE BREAD 

Separate two eggs. To the yolks add a half cup of milk. Mix. 
Stir in two-thirds of a cupful of chestnut meal. Cover and stand 
in a cool place over night. Next morning, add the whites of 
the eggs well beaten, a level teaspoonful of baking powder, and 
a half teaspoonful of salt. Make into thin cakes, and bake either 
in the oven or on a hot griddle. 

TO KEEP CHESTNUTS FRESH 

Chestnuts mold easily if they are allowed to remain in a pile 
before they become thoroughly dry. To keep them fresh for 
several months after picking, put a layer of sand in the bottom 
of the box, then a layer of chestnuts, then another layer of sand, 
and so continue until the box is filled, having at last a thick 
layer of sand. Keep in a cool place, 

TO DRY CHESTNUTS 

Shell the chestnuts, but do not remove the brown skin, and 
spread them in the sun until they are thoroughly dry ; or dry in 
a cool oven. If placed out of doors in the sun, they must be 
removed before the falling of the dew, and not put out in the 
morning until the sun has sufficient power to dry the atmos- 
phere. Moisture will cause mold. 

TO USE DRIED CHESTNUTS 

Soak over night in water, and use precisely the same as fresh 
chestnuts. 

MARRON GLACE 

Select large European chestnuts — our own may be used equally 
well, only they are small and difficult to shell. Remove the 
shells and brown skin. Cover them with fresh boiling 
water. Boil rapidly until tender, but not too soft; drain and 
weigh, and to each pint, add a quarter of a good oily vanilla

530 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

bean and one pound of sugar. Split the bean into halves ; then 
cut it into small pieces, being very careful not to waste or lose 
the seeds. Add the sugar to a half pint of water ; stir until dis- 
solved ; bring to boiling point ; boil a minute and add the chest- 
nuts. Push the saucepan to the back of the stove and cook 
slowly until the chestnuts are soft, dark and very rich. Lift 
each carefully with a fork, put them in a bottle or jar, and cover 
with the boiling syrup. Seal and stand aside. These will keep 
for any length of time. 

COCOANUT {Cocos nucifera) 

Cocoanut is derived from a species of palm, called the cocoa- 
palm. This tree grows in all tropical regions and bears annu- 
ally about one hundred nuts. The nut consists of a single seed 
in a hard shell surrounded by a thick fibrous mass encased in a 
smooth husk. A soft white pulp lines the hard shell, the centre 
of which is filled with a sweet water, frequently called the milk 
of the cocoanut. These nuts are of great economic importance. 
In fact, they furnish food, drink, fuel, clothing, ropes, carpets 
and general utensils to the inhabitants of the countries in which 
they grow. The dry fleshy edible portion contains about seventy 
per cent, of fixed oil, which is sold under the name of cocoa- 
butter. Cocoanut butter or oil makes excellent frying material. 
It heats quickly at a low temperature, and is not rapidly 
absorbed by the frying articles. Preparations of cocoanut butter 
are sold under various names, as Nutko, Ko-nut, and in some 
places under the name of Cocoanut Butter. Its melting point 
is 70° Fahr., which makes it difficult to transport in warm 
weather. 

The flesh of fresh cocoanut grated and washed yields cocoa- 
nut milk and cream, two excellent substitutes to take the place 
of cow's milk and cream. This milk may be used for the mak- 
ing of sauces and soups, while the cream will take the place of 
olive oil or butter. The fibre is dense and difficult of digestion, 
and when mixed with sweets, as in cakes, is a fruitful source of 
acute indigestion, unless it has been thoroughly divided and 
sparingly used. 



NUTS 531 

COCOANUT MILK 

Grate three good-sized cocoanuts; cover with two quarts of 
boiling water; stir with a paddle until the cocoanut is thor- 
oughly washed ; strain through a piece of cheese cloth, wringing 
the fibre perfectly dry. Stand this at once in a cool place. 

Cover the cocoanut again with one quart of boiling water, 
stir, drain and wring perfectly dry. Do not mix the two milks, 
but stand both away to cool. When cold, remove from the sur- 
face the cocoanut cream, and both are ready for use. 

COCOANUT SAUCE 

This is exceedingly nice with cauliflower or lima beans, or may 
be used as a sauce for baked or boiled tomatoes. 

Rub one tablespoonful of flour with two tablespoonfuls of 
cocoanut cream ; when smooth, add a half pint of cocoanut milk ; 
stir over the fire until boiling. Take from the fire, add a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and it is ready for use. 

COCOANUT JAMBOLAYA 

Scald six medium-sized tomatoes and remove the skins. Cut a 
slice from stem end, and carefully take out the seeds. Chop 
sufficient celery to make a half pint. Add to the celery a half 
pint of finely grated cocoanut, a half teaspoonful of salt and 
just a suspicion of onion juice, not more than one teaspoonful. 
Stuff this into the tomatoes. Stand them on the bottom of a 
large saucepan, and partly cover them with cocoanut milk ; 
cover the saucepan and cook slowly for fifteen minutes. Lift 
each tomato carefully and arrange neatly on a round dish, in 
the centre of which you have a boiled head of cauliflower. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of flour and two of cocoanut cream 
in a saucepan and mix ; add one pint of cocoanut milk in which 
the tomatoes were cooked ; stir until boiling ; add a half tea- 
spoonful of salt and one level teaspoonful of curry powder, 
moistened in a little cocoanut cream. Bring to boiling point and 
strain over the cauliflower and tomatoes. Garnish the edge of 
the dish with triangular pieces of toasted bread. In between 
each tomato put a good-sized sprig of parsley or cress, and senc| 
i\t once to the table.

COCOANUT SUGAR BALLS 

These little balls may be dipped in melted chocolate or may be 
served plain and passed in the place of bonbons at the end of 
the dinner. Add sufficient confectioners' sugar to the cocoanut 
cream to make a thick paste. Form at once into balls and stand 
in the refrigerator or very cold place until serving time. If 
these are dipped in chocolate, they must be dipped quickly and 
put at once in a cold place, or they will lose their shape. 

COCOANUT BLOCKS 

Stir sufficient powdered sugar into cocoanut cream to form a 
paste. Now add sufficient chopped nuts, almonds and pecans to 
make a rather dry, hard paste. Roll on an ordinary baking 
board into a sheet a half inch thick. Cut into blocks and stand 
at once in a cold place. Serve at the end of dinner in place of 
dessert. 

FILBERT, HAZEL OR COBNUT 

Of these we have several varieties. The small hazel-nuts with 
which we are familiar are the American varieties (Coryhis 
Americana, Walters, and Coryhis rostrata, Aiton). The large 
attractive filberts or cobnuts, Coryhis Avellana, Linn., come to 
us from Eiu'ope. The best of the filberts come from Spain, and 
are known as Barcelona nuts. The cobnut, Coryhis grandus, is 
the English filbert, coming largely from the neighborhood of 
Kent. This variety is to me the most delicious of all. In Eng- 
land, they are served fresh and green, and with brown bread 
and butter and lettuce salad, make a most attractive lunch. The 
nutritive value of hazel-nuts is no doubt high, but not equal to 
nuts belonging to the walnut family. All nuts, however, form 
a suitable substitute for meat, provided they are thoroughly 
ground and cooked.

WALNUT FAMILY {Juglandaccoe) 

The hickory nut, shell-bark and pecan tiut are seeds of trees 
belonging to the group Carya of this great family. There arc 
several varieties, but for our use we shall Call attention only to 
the hickory, shell-bark and pecan nut, all of which are high in 
nutritive value, and especially rich in albuminoids and fats. 
The expressed oil from these tiuts makes an appetizing substi- 
tute for olive oil on salads. 

WALNUTS 

The ordinary English walnuts (Jicglans rcgia, Linn.) are quite 
common in this country. They are, perhaps, the most indi- 
gestible of all nuts. Salt is said to aid in their digestion. It is 
far wiser, however, not to eat indigestible foods, than to take 
aids to digestion. The outside papery covering of the kernel, 
the brown skin under the shell, is rich in tannin. When the 
nuts are served in salad or mixed with materials for stuffings, 
this skin should be carefully peeled off. It is equally bitter 
with the skin of the almond. 

Juglans nigra, Linn., is the connnon black walnut of Amer- 
ica, rich in oil and albuminoids, palatable and most valuable to 
mix with other nuts. Closely related to this is the American 
butter-nut or white walnut, the nut of Juglans cincrea, Linn., 
which has the appearance of a long black walnut. Crack on 
the ends, if you desire to remove the kernels in perfect halves. 

Unripe walnuts, while the shell is still soft, make an excel- 
lent pickle. It must be sufficiently soft to be easily punctured 
with a pin. Like the peanut, the walnut is of great economic 
value* The kernel is ground, the oil expressed, and the residue 
sold as "cake" for cattle food.

LITCHI NUT 

It is the fruit of a tree growing in China and the Philippine 
Islands. The nuts come to our market dry, in their brown thin 
shells. The flesh, once soft, now dry, leaves a large space 
between the shell and stone. The fruit is sweet and tasty. The 
flesh is an agreeable addition to the ordinary fruit cheese. 
Canned litchies can be purchased in any Chinese shop ; they are 
sweet, white, very palatable, and free from both stones and 
shells. To serve, drain oflf the liquor, turn the litchies into a 
pretty glass dish, sprinkle with a little chopped ice, and, if you 
use it, two or three tablespoonfuls of sherry. 

PEANUTS (Arachis hypogaea, Linn.) 

These are frequently called ground nuts, but must not be con- 
founded with the true ground nut, Apios tuberosa. The peanut 
is a leguminous plant, ripening its seeds below the surface of 
the soil. The whole plant is of economic value. The vine is 
used as hay, and the residue from the compressed nuts in the 
manufacture of peanut oil is sold, under the name of "cake," 
as cattle food. 

In nourishment, peanuts are quite equal to the other legu- 
minous seeds, as peas, beans and lentils. These nuts are acces- 
sible in all parts of the United States, contain starch and must 
be roasted or boiled to give them full food value. Care must be 
taken, however, that the nuts are not overcooked, especially if 
the cooking is done in a dry heat, as in the oven. If the nuts 
become brown, the flavor is destroyed. If undercooked, they 
produce peanut meal, which is of great economic value in the 
household. It can be used for cakes, made into purees and 
puddings. Mixed with fruit and boiled, it gives a "mock 
meat" exceedingly palatable, and highly nutritious.

PEANUT BUTTER 

Roast the nuts, shell and blow off the brown skins. When 
making it in large quantities, it will pay to have a bellows for 
this purpose, or put the peanuts on a coarse towel, cover them 
with another towel, rub them gently, then blow off the skins. 
If you use salt dust them lightly with it and grind at once. 
Pack the butter into glass jars or tumblers, cover them and 
keep in a cool place. This may be used plain or diluted with 
water. 

PEANUT MEAL 

Peanut meal may be used as thickening for soups or sauces, or 
may be added in small quantities to our breakfast muffin, sally 
lunn, or griddle cakes. Add but little flour; the peanuts con- 
tain starch, which will take the place of flour, and fat to take 
the place of shortening. Procure raw peanuts; shell the nuts 
and put into the oven just long enough to loosen the brown 
skins. Rub these off and grind the nuts. Adjust the grinder 
so that you will have a meal rather than an oily mixture. Put 
this aside in glass jars ; it will keep for several weeks in a cool 
place, if properly covered. 

PEANUT WAFERS 

Mix a half cup of peanut meal with a half cup of peanut but- 
ter; beat thoroughly, then add gradually one and a half cups 
of sugar. Dissolve a half teaspoonful of soda in a half cup 
of warm water ; add to the nut mixture and then work in about 
three cups of Graham meal. The dough must be rather hard. 
Roll out into a very thin sheet, and cut into squares of two 
inches. Bake in a very slow oven until a golden brown. 

PINONS OR PINE NUTS 

These nuts are also sold under the name of pinolas or pig- 
nolias. They are the seeds of several varieties of pines. The 
European pines producing edible seeds, have a hard cone which 



636 MRS. roker's new cook book 

must be sawed into several pieces to remove the nuts. In this 
country, however, the Pinus edulis, growing on the dry hills of 
Colorado and California, produce a large cone containing very 
good-sized seeds, which are covered with a thin outside shell. 
These shells are threshed off by the Indians, and the nuts are 
sold in our markets under the name of pine-nuts. They are 
very palatable, wholesome and cheap. We have several varie- 
ties of pines in the Western part of the United States with 
seeds sufficiently large to be used as food. The form and size 
of the nuts vary greatly in different species. In the Eastern 
markets we have two varieties, both of which come to us 
shelled. They require thorough washing and careful drying, 
and are then ready for use. They are the most valuable of all 
nuts for household purposes, being cheap, nutritious and pala- 
table. 

PISTACHIO NUT (Pistacia vera) 

This nut has a little of the bitter-almond flavor, although in 
appearance it is very unlike it. It contains chlorophyll, the 
green coloring matter of plants ; it is about one inch long, 
enclosed in a thin brittle shell. The nuts are salted, roasted in 
the shells and served the same as salted almonds. Being 
expensive, they are used principally as flavoring and garnish- 
ing to sweets. 

SOUARI NUT 

This attractive nut comes to us from South America. It is the 
fruit of any one of the genus Caryocar, a tree belonging to the 
Camellia or tea family. These nuts are very rich in oil, and are 
known in some parts of the United States as butter-nuts. This 
term seems to be applied in various localities to any nut that is 
extremely rich in oil. In the South, the Brazil nuts are univers- 
ally called butter-nuts ; along the coast, the souari nuts are the 
butter-nuts; through the East and interior the white walnut is 
the butter-nut. The term, however, signifies but little outside of 
certain localities. The flowers of the souari nuts are produced 
in terminal clusters ; the nuts are fixed to a central axis. Wlien 
they fall apart, they have the appearance of being mashed or 



NUtS 637 

broken off, the shell being slightly open at place of attach- 
ment. The kernel of the nut is much the shape of the Brazil 
nut. It is covered with a thick brown skin underneath the 
shell, which must be pared off before using. They contain 
little cellulose, and are very palatable when served with let- 
tuce salad. The nUt itself tastes perhaps more like the cocoanut 
than the ordinary small shell nuts. They are quite common in 
many of the nut shops of New York and Philadelphia, but are 
rarely seen away from the seaport towns. 

WATER CHESTNUTS (Prapa) 

These nuts are largely used by the Chinese and Japanese, to 
be served with chicken in place of succulent vegetables. Occa- 
sionally one can find them at the Chinese shops. They have 
an agreeable, crisp flavor, reminding one of stachys or the 
Jerusalem artichoke. The nuts are dark brown with a broad 
central portion, from which two horns extend in opposite direc- 
tions, giving the nut the appearance of a tiny ox head. These 
nuts are sold on the Californian coast under the name of 
Jesuits' nut. 

The SiNGHARA Nuts of India and Ceylon are closely allied 
to the water chestnut. To use — shell, peel and boil with 
chicken, or in chicken stock, twenty minutes. 

NUT AND FRUIT CRACKERS 

I pound of whole wheat flour y^ cup of almond butter 
I pound of seeded and chopped raisins 

Rub the almond butter into the flour ; when thoroughly mixed 
add sufficient water, about one cup, to just moisten. The 
dough must be very hard. Knead for a few moments, and roll 
out in a very thin sheet; sprinkle over one-half of this sheet 
the chopped raisins, fold over the other half, and, with a roll- 
ing pin, roll the two carefully together. Cut into crackers about 
two inches wide, and three inches long; place in a baking pan 
and bake in a moderate oven until brown and crisp, about 
twenty minutes. 



538 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Peanut butter may be substituted for almond butter, and 
dates or figs for raisins. Graham flour may be substituted 
for the whole wheat flour. 



NUT CROQUETTES 

Mix one cupful of bread crumbs with one cupful of finely 
chopped nuts; season with a half teaspoonful of salt and a 
dash of pepper, drop in one unbeaten egg, and mix thoroughly ; 
roll in egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. 

Vegetarians would use either olive or cotton seed oil, or 
cocoanut butter. Serve with tomato sauce. 



NUT SOUFFLE 

This dish will take the place of croquettes for those who can- 
not use fried foods. 

Put one pint of soft fine crumbs with a half pint of cocoa- 
nut milk over the fire. Boil and stir until perfectly smooth; 
take from the fire; work in carefully a half pint of chopped 
nuts ; add a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper ; fold in 
carefully the well-beaten whites of five eggs. Turn this into 
a baking dish and bake in a quick oven ten to fifteen minutes. 
Serve at once or it will fall. This will take the place of meat. 

NUT CHEESE 

j4 pound of almonds ^ pound of filbert or hazel- 

3^2 pound of pine-nuts nuts 

Yz pound of pecan nuts JX pound of roasted peanuts 

Prepare these nuts as directed ; put them through the nut 
grinder. Knead the mixture until it becomes a little soft, pack 
closely into tumblers or baking powder boxes, and stand at 
once in a cold place. When wanted for use, hold the boxes in 
hot water, until the nuts are sufficiently warm to slip out 
easily ; cut the cheese down into slices and serve in the place of 
meat.

NUT AND FRUIT CHEESE 

This mixture makes one of the nicest of all sandwich fillings, 
and is almost a meal in itself. 

Yz pound of figs Ya, pound of almonds 

Yz pound of raisins . ^ pound of pine-nuts 

Y2 pound of dates Ya pound of Brazil nuts 

Yz pound of pecan nuts 

Wash the figs, stone the dates and the raisins — seedless rais- 
ins may be used and are really just as good. Mix the nuts. Put 
through a meat chopper, first a little fruit, then a few nuts, and 
so continue until all are chopped and mixed. Press the mixture 
down into either baking powder boxes or small, square tins, 
and stand it aside. When wanted for use, loosen the mixture 
from the sides of the boxes with a thin knife blade and turn 
it out on a board. Cut into very thin slices and serve in the 
place of meat. For sandwiches put a thin slice between two 
layers of bread and butter. These nut foods are excellent 
fillings for school sandwiches. 

MOCK CANDY 

The rule for put cheese. The same quantity of fruit cheese. 
Pack each into half-pound square cocoa boxes. Dip the 
boxes into hot water, and turn the cheese on a board. Cut the 
nut cheese in smooth, thin slices, and the fruit cheese in slices 
twice the thickness. Put one slice of fruit between two slices 
of nuts, press them lightly, and cut into blocks the size and 
shape of caramels. These are very good and wholesome, and 
will take the place of candy. 

NUT SHORT-CAKE 

Sift two rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder with one 
quart of flour, add a half teaspoonful of salt. Moisten a half 
cupful of nut butter with one and a half cupfuls of cold water, 
when perfectly smooth, add gradually the flour. The dough 



540 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

must be moist, but not wet. Take this qliickly out on a board ; 
knead and roll into a sheet a half inch in thickness ; cut with 
a round biscuit cutter and bake, the same as ordinary cream 
biscuits, in a quick oven twenty minutes. 

White flour, Graham flour, or whole wheat flour may be 
used. 

NUT SAUSAGE 

I quart of dried bread crumbs i saltspoonful of pepper 

I pint of nut butter i tablespoonful of chopped 

I level teaspoonful of sage parsley 

1 rounding teaspoonful of salt 

Mix all the ingredients thoroughly and add sufficient cold 
water to bind them together. Form in a roll about six inches 
long, put it in a baking pan, pouring in the bottom of the pan 
a little diluted nut butter; roast one hour, basting frequently, 
and serve hot with a sauce made in the pan in which it was 
cooked. Persons using eggs may bind the mixture together 
with three raw eggs beaten with a quarter cup of cold water. 
Any and all the nuts may be used for this purpose, and the 
sausage may be flavored with onions, allowing a tablespoonful 
of grated onion to the recipe given. 

NUT ROLLS 

I quart of carefully cooked Yz teaspoonful of celery seed or 

hominy grits a half cup of chopped cel- 

I pint of nut butter ery 

Yz pint of stale bread crumbs or 3 hard boiled eggs 

grated zwieback 2 rounding teaspoonfuls of salt 

I tablespoonful of chopped i saltspoonful of pepper 
parsley 

Cook the hominy in water until perfectly tender. Put it into 
a bowl and add all the other ingredients, the eggs being chopped 
fine. Form into a large roll or shape it in the form of a chicken, 
or a fish, or in good-sized balls. If made in the form of fish 
or chicken, or a roll, place them in a baking pan, add a half 
cupful of nut butter diluted with a half pint of warm water; 



NUTS 541 

roast one hour, basting frequently. When done dish and gar- 
nish with parsley and lemons cut into quarters. Rub together 
two tablespoonfuls of pine-nut butter and two tablespoon fuls 
of flour. Add this to the mixture in which the roll was cooked, 
then add a half pint of boiling water and stir until smooth and 
the consistency of cream. Add the juice of a lemon, a half 
teaspoon ful of salt and a dash of pepper ; strain, and send to the 
table in a boat. 

If this mixture is made into croquettes or balls, dip them 
in Ggg, roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. Serve in plain 
cream or tomato sauce. 

OTHER USES OF NUTS 

Chopped almonds, pecan-nuts and pine-nuts may be sprinkled 
over lettuce and covered with French dressing for a dinner 
salad. 

Pine-nuts may be stuffed into boned meats, in place of other 
stuffings. 

They may also be added to made meat dishes. Or they may 
be slightly dusted with salt and served the same as salted 
almonds. 

Nuts may be added to the cream vegetable soups; for 
instance, asparagus soup may be made after the ordinary 
recipe, omitting the butter and flour, an J adding four table- 
spoonfuls of peanut meal or four tablespoonfuls of pine-nut 
butter ; or one may add the mixed butters and in this way make 
many varieties. An inventive mind will create from these 
recipes fifty to sixty different soups. Potato soup, cream of 
corn soup, cream of pea or bean soup ; salsify, turnips, or carrots 
may be used with combinations of nuts. Diebetics may use 
soups made from such vegetables as spinach, lettuce, celery, 
and turnip ; thicken and flavor them with almond, pine-nut, 
or Brazil nut butter. 

NUT BREADS 

The oily nuts, as Brazil, pine, black walnut, white walnut, or 
American butter-nuts and cocoanut may be used in place of 
other shortening in all breads and cakes. 



SER.VING OF FRUITS 



During the warm months substitute fruits for the heavier 
starches, sugars and meats. To have them wholesome and 
easy of digestion, serve them plain, uncooked and ripe. Small 
fruits, as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, huckleberries 
and currants should be moderately chilled ; over-chilling renders 
them severely acid and unpalatable. The sub-acids or sweet fruits, 
as mulberries, guavas, bananas, cantaloupes and watermelons, 
should be served quite cold; peaches medium. The small, soft 
fruits should be handled as little and as lightly as possible. If 
sandy, wash them by putting them into a colander and dipping 
the colander down and up several times in a pan of cold water. 
Strawberries should be washed before they are hulled, other- 
wise they become water-soaked. Do not, under any circum- 
stances, throw the fruit into the water and lift them out with 
the hands. 

In almost every community leaves from fruit trees or leaves 
from appropriate flowers may be secured for the garnishing 
of fruits. Even in the woods or on the mountain side the 
dainty huckleberry leaves or ferns are always accessible. The 
French, who pay attention to the beautiful, use artificial leaves 
where fresh leaves are not to be obtained, and while this is not 
to be recommended as artistic, the beautiful is always to be 
considered. "The beautiful is frequently as useful as the 
useful." 

For breakfast, or first course at lunch, strawberries are by 
far daintier served with the hulls on, around a little mound of 
powdered sugar. To eat, simply dip them in the powdered 
sugar, holding the berries by the stem or hull. 

All fruits contain sufficient sugar ; that is, according to 
nature's way of doing. If they are too acid to be palatable they 
are too acid to be eaten. This is nature's way of warning us 
against unwholesome foods. Sugar in no way corrects an 

54^

SERVING OF FRUITS 543 

acid; it may cover the fruit, disguise it and make it pass the 
palate, but the two enter the stomach as they were originally, 
the acid as acid and the sugar as sugar. Together they are more 
dangerous than when taken alone. Sugar with the fruit is 
very liable to fermentation. 

Fruits are digested principally in the intestines. 

THE APPLE 

The apple is chief among fruits. There is no doubt but that it is 
more easily digested when cooked; but it certainly is palatable 
and wholesome raw. 

BAKED APPLES 

Remove the cores from large sweet apples. Place them in an 
earthen or granite pan, cover the bottom with boiling water and 
bake in a quick oven, basting every five minutes. Serve warm. 
Cold apples are heavy and sodden, and should not be eaten by 
persons with weak digestion. 



PANNED BAKED APPLES 

These are exceedingly nice to serve with the meat course at din- 
ner. Wash and core the apples, but do not pare them. Cut them 
into eighths. Put a layer in a baking dish, cover this with two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, then another layer of apples, and so 
continue until the dish is filled. Add to a quart of these, a half 
pint of water, cover the pan and bake in a quick oven until soft, 
about fifteen minutes. They must be tender, but quite whole. 
Serve warm in the pan in which they were baked. 



SLICED APPLES FOR BREAKFAST 

Pare, core and slice several apples ; put them into a baking dish ; 
cover with cream, and bake for twenty minutes. Another way 
is to cover them with well-cooked oatmeal, and bake fifteen min- 
utes. Serve with milk. 



544 



STEWED APPLES 



Take firm, sound apples of average size ; core without paring ; 
stand them in a porcelain-lined kettle; add sufficient water to 
cover the bottom; cover and simmer gently until they are just 
soft. Lift with a skimmer ; dish ; add to the water in the kettle 
sufficient sugar to sweeten ; add a few drops of lemon juice, and 
pour the syrup thus made over the apples. Serve warm. 

A SIMPLE APPLE SAUCE 

Core the apples, do not pare, and cut in thin slices ; cover with 
sufficient water to prevent scorching. As soon as they boil, 
press them through a colander to remove the skins. To each 
half pint add a piece of butter the size of a hickory-nut, and two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Serve warm or cold. This form of 
apple sauce is usually served with duck, goose or pork, and is 
exceedingly nice as a sauce for breakfast or supper. A more 
elaborate sauce is made by adding to the apples, after they have 
been pressed through the sieve, butter, sugar, two tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, and, to each pint, the well-beaten whites of three 
eggs. 

WHOLE APPLE SAUCE 

Pare, quarter and core the apples. Make a syrup from half a 
cupful of sugar and half a pint of water. When it boils, add a 
little lemon peel and then the apples. Put them on the back part 
of the stove, where they may cook slowly, until transparent and 
tender. Serve warm or cold. 

COCKTAILS 

The word cocktail has slipped into our menus or bills of fare, 
and no longer means a mixture of liquors. We have fruit cock- 
tails, strawberry cocktails, and clam cocktails all made without 
alcohol. 

In early spring, when strawberries are just coming and are 
expensive, strawberry cocktails for four people may be made 
from a pint of strawberries. These mixed fruit cocktails are 
served in punch glasses, eaten with an ordinary fruit fork or a. 
long, slender bowled spoon. 



SERVING OF FRUITS 646 

STRAWBERRY COCKTAILS 

Into each glass slice five or six strawberries ; squeeze over the 
juice of one large orange; stand aside until wanted. At serving 
time, add a heaping teaspoon ful of powdered sugar, and a table- 
spoonful of finely cracked or shaved ice. 

SHADDOCK COCKTAILS 

Cut the shaddocks or grape fruit into halves; carefully scoop 
out the pulp without any of the inner white skin. After this has 
been done, clean out the sides of the shells and throw them into 
cold water. Hull a pint of strawberries, mix them with the 
shaddock pulp ; add two tablespoonf uls of powdered sugar and 
stand the mixture on the ice. At serving time, shake the shells 
from the water; fill them with the strawberries and shaddock 
mixture ; add a tablespoonful of finely shaved ice, and if you use 
it, a tablespoonful of rum or sherry. Stand the shells on a dainty 
paper mat or on a spray of fern, and send at once to the table. 

ORANGE COCKTAILS 

Oranges and strawberries may be blended precisely the same as 
shaddock or grape fruit and strawberries, and the mixture 
served in orange baskets made from the shells of the oranges. 

FRUIT COCKTAILS 

In the winter, when fresh fruits cannot be obtained, a very nice 
cocktail may be made by slicing two very ripe bananas, adding 
to them one grated pineapple, the juice of one lemon and one 
orange. This may be seasoned and served in punch glasses. 

Canned fruits may be used for cocktails, provided they are 
nicely blended; for instance, strawberries and peaches, the 
peaches chopped fine and seasoned with orange juice; apricots 
with canned cherries. 

These cocktails are served at the beginning of lunch or din- 
ner, and take the place of shell fish or soup, 



546 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

MIXED FRUIT COCKTAILS 

This is liiade from a mixture of all kinds of fruit chopped very 
fine. At serving time, fill either champagne or punch glasses 
half full of the mixture ; put in the centre two tablespoon fuls of 
orange or lemon water ice, or, if you like, mint ice, and serve as 
a dessert. 

STRAWBERRIES, FRENCH FASHION 

Stem and arrange the strawberries neatly in a shallow glass 
dish. Squeeze over them the juice of one or two oranges and 
four tablespoon fuls of finely shaved ice, and send at once to 
the table. Pass with them powdered sugar. 

RASPBERRY CUP 

Mash and strain one pint of currants stripped from the stems ; 
look over carefully one pint of raspberries, and put them aside 
to moderately chill. At serving time fill lemonade glasses half 
full with raspberries, cover with the currant juice, add a heap- 
ing teaspoon ful of powdered sugar, and serve as dessert, or as 
first course for lunch or company breakfast. 

STRAWBERRIES IN FONDANT 

Make a fondant and melt it over hot water ; have it moderately 
thin. Select tiny paper cases, or a flat stoneware dish. Fold 
the hull close to the stem, dip the strawberries in the fondant, 
and put at once in the paper cases or on the platter to cool. 
When covering is cold, heap them on a dainty glass dish and 
serve them as bonbons. 

Cherries, Currants and Grapes may be served in the 
same fashion. 

TO SERVE RASPBERRIES 

These are the most delicate of the soft fruits and require careful 
handling. Growing above the ground, they do not, as a rule, 
require washing. If they should be sandy, turn them in a col-

ander, put it carefully in a pan of cold water and gently lift it 
up. Do this the last moment before serving. Then toss them 
lightly into a glass bowl and squeeze over the juice of one 
lemon. 

As they are a sweet fruit they do not require sugar. 



TO SERVE WHOLE FRUITS 

Select for these a raised dish with a centre stand. These are 
sold under the name of high fruit dish or fruit stand. 

Arrange apples and oranges in the bottom of the dish ; stick 
here and there full, ripe bananas ; arrange clusters of grapes to 
fall gracefully over the dish and one bunch in the centre. Stick 
among the fruits any green leaves or ferns that you may have 
at hand that will blend nicely with the fruit. Use for serving 
of whole fruit a plate with finger bowl, and both a spoon and 
fruit knife. 

WATERMELONS 

Wash, wipe and put the watermelon into a very cold place to 
rest for several hours. When ready to serve, cut a little slice 
from the stem end, just enough to make it stand. Cut the 
melon into halves, dish one half on a round plate, garnish 
the plate with green leaves, and send at once to the table. 

To serve, scoop out the pulp in large egg-shaped pieces 
with a table or serving spoon. It is not elegant to serve the 
rind of watermelon on individual plates. 



CHILLED WATERMELON 

Cut the ripe, pink flesh from a good-sized watermelon; put it 
into a freezing can and pack with salt and ice ; turn the crank 
slowly until the watermelon is half frozen. Serve in punch 
glasses at the close of lunch or dinner. 

Those who use wine may add to each glass a tablespoonful 
of sherry. 



548 MRS. rorer's new cook book ^ 

CANTALOUPES 

Wash and scrub the cantaloupes as soon as they come from 
the market. Growing on the ground, they are usually very 
sandy. Put them into a very cold place. They must be suffi- 
ciently chilled not to require ice at serving time. Cantaloupes 
filled with shaved ice are tasteless and watery. When ready to 
serve, cut the cantaloupes into halves, and with a spoon take 
out the seeds without removing any of the flesh. Serve a half 
to each person, serving with them knife, fork and spoon. 

MIXED FRUITS IN A BORDER OF LEMON ICE 

Pack a border mold with carefully made water-ice; cover the 
mold, and pack it in salt and ice for at least two hours. Chop 
fine one tart apple, add a grated pineapple, a banana cut into 
thin slices, the pulp of four oranges, one grape fruit ; add four 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and, if you have them, a 
half pint of raspberries, either fresh or canned. Put the mix- 
ture aside until ice cold. At serving time, turn the border 
mold of lemon ice into the centre of a round dish. Fill the 
space in the middle with the fruit mixture. Garnish the outside 
of the water-ice with fresh roses, and serve as a dessert for a 
company lunch or supper. 

The variety of the fruit may be changed to meet the demands 
of the season. 

TO SERVE FRESH PEACHES 

Select large and perfectly ripe peaches. With soft canton flan- 
nel rub the outside gently ; arrange them neatly on a high fruit 
dish, garnish with fresh peach leaves, and send at once to the 
table. 

With these you will use fruit plates, finger bowls and fruit 
knives. 

If peaches are sliced they must be sliced at the very last 
moment, as they become discolored when exposed to the air. 
Peaches should not be sugared until they are served.

the pan with water, and bake in a quick over (360° Fahr.) thirty 
minutes, basting once or twice. Dish, add to the pan the juice 
of an orange or lemon, or, if you use it, four tablespoonfuls of 
port or sherry. Stir it around and baste it over the bananas. 
Serve at once. 

BANANA SOUFFLE 

6 very ripe bananas Juice of one orange or lemon 

Whites of four eggs Sugar 

Peel and mash the bananas ; add the orange juice, or, if you use 
wine, a quarter cupful of port wine and a palatable seasoning of 
sugar, about six tablespoonfuls. Beat well, and fold in the 
whites well beaten. Heap in a baking dish and bake in a quick 
oven twenty minutes. Serve at once. For my own use, I omit 
all flavoring and sweetening. 

STEWED DRIED FIGS 

Wash pulled figs through several cold waters, cover them with 
cold water, add to each pound one bay leaf, and soak over night. 
Next morning put them, water and all, over the fire and bring 
slowly to boiling point. Lift the figs with a skimmer, boil down 
the syrup one half, and pour it over the figs. These may be 
served alone the same as stewed fruit, or with plain or whipped 
cream. 

STEWED RAISINS 

Wash the raisins, and proceed precisely the same as for figs. 
All saccharin fruits have a high food value. 



550 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

STEWED PRUNES 

Wash the prunes, cover them with cold water, and soak them 
over night. Next morning drain, boil the water until reduced 
one-half, add the prunes, bring to a boil, but be very careful not 
to boil a mon:ient. Take from the fire and cool. Sugar and long 
cooking spoil prunes. 

DRIED FRUITS 

All dried fruits, as peaches, apricots, and pears, should be 
washed, soaked over night, and cooked slowly for a half hour, 
without sugar. Boil the syrup down to the proper consistency. 



PASTRY 



TO MAKE LIGHT CRISP PASTRY 

Use good fine pastry flour and the very best butter. Have the 
flour, butter, and the room in which you make the paste, very 
cold. A marble slab is, of course, best ; but you can very well 
use the ordinary wood or metal board. All pastry is improved 
by being kept on ice over night, or several hours before using. 
Puff paste must be kept twenty-four hours, and is better at the 
end of four days, provided it is carefully wrapped. Of course, 
the layers of light paste are thin, but each layer is dense and 
should never be eaten by persons with weak digestion. All 
forms of so-called pie crust are to be condemned ; for this reason 
the department is necessarily small. 



PUFF PASTE 

I pound of sifted pastry flour i pound of butter 

I tcaspoonful of salt i teaspoonful of sugar 

White of one egg i cup of ice water (half pint) 

Scald a large bowl ; fill it with cold water and let it stand for a 
few moments to cool ; then fill with ice water. Wash the hands 
in hot soapsuds, rinse in cold water, but do not wipe. Put the 
butter into the bowl in the cold water, wash or work it under 
the water, without pressing it into the bowl, until it becomes 
soft and elastic. Take off a piece the size of a large hen's egg ; 
pat the remaining quantity into a thin sheet, and lay it on a piece 
of cheesecloth on the ice. Put the flour in the centre of a large 
dinner plate or on a marble slab ; make a well in the centre, put 
in the piece of butter, the salt, sugar, white of egg and half the 
water. Begin to work in the flour, and as the dough is formed 
add a little water and more flour until you have a dough the con- 
sistency of bread. Dust the board with flour, and knead the

dough until it is soft and elastic, keeping your hands as cool as 
possible. Cut the dough into halves ; roll each half out into a 
sheet a half inch thick. Dry the butter on the cheesecloth ; dust 
it with flour on both sides ; put it on one sheet, cover it with the 
other, fastening the edges together, and roll quickly, from you, 
being careful not to break the dough. Fold in the sides, then 
the ends, turning the paste around so that the fold will run to 
and from you; roll from you, and again fold as before. Place 
on a dry napkin, then on a dish and on the ice for fifteen min- 
utes. Then roll again, having the fold in the same position ; fold 
and roll again. Stand it on the ice for another fifteen minutes. 
Do this until you have given it six rolls or turns ; eight will make 
it lighter, if you know how to roll ; but, if it is your first trial, 
six will be quite sufficient. Wrap it in a dry napkin, put it on 
a plate and in the refrigerator over night. 

TO BAKE PUFF PASTE 

This is quite as important as the making; everything must be 
very cold. The paste must be rolled quickly, cut into pates or 
vol-au-vent, placed on the ice until thoroughly chilled. The oven 
must be at least 400° Fahr. It may be cooled slightly after the 
paste has risen, as It scorches easily ; but it is best to have the 
oven about 400° at first. As soon as the pastry has risen, cool 
down the oven to 360° Fahr. For pates and vol-au-vent, the 
oven should have a strong under-heat, allowing them to go to 
the fullest height before browning. If the oven, however, is too 
hot, the pastry will brown before it is light, and be dense and 
heavy, no matter how well made. 

CHICKEN PATES 

Cook the chicken the day before it is to be used. 

1 batch of puff paste i pint of milk 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter 2 tablespoonfuls of flour

then with a round cutter cut into rounds. With another cutter, 
three sizes smaller, cut the centres from two-thirds of the 
rounds, leaving one-third uncut for the bottoms of the pates; 
brush the solid one near the edge with white of egg, put on a 
ring, brush this with white of egg ; put on the other ring ; brush 
the centre of the ring with a little yolk of egg mixed with water, 
being careful that the egg does not run down the sides of the 
pate, or it will cement and hold the edges together. Place these 
on an oiled paper on a baking sheet. When you have finished 
the last pate, stand them on the ice until very cold. During this 
time, heat the oven. Place the cold pates in a very hot oven 
(about 400° Fahr.), and watch carefully that the heat does not 
increase ; in fact, it is better to decrease it just a little, and bake 
slowly until they have risen to five or six times their original 
height. To keep the pates perfectly straight, cut a wedge of 
bread from a thick slice with the small cutter used for making 
the rings; put this bread in the pates just as you are putting 
them in the oven, or before placing them on the ice. When the 
pates are half baked, remove the bread wedges and allow the 
inner portion to bake. Pates may be baked several hours before 
they are wanted and warmed at serving time, or they may be 
made the day before. When wanted for use, rub the butter and 
flour together, add the milk cold, stir until boiling, add the salt, 
pepper, the mushrooms chopped fine and the chicken cut into 
dice. Stand over boiling water for fifteen or twenty minutes. 
At serving time, fill this into the pates, and send at once to the 
table. The centres of the rings may be baked and used as lids 
for the pates. 

Oyster Pates are made in precisely the same way, using 
creamed oysters. Put two oysters and a little sauce in each pate. 

Sweetbread Pates are made the same as chicken pates, 
Use one pair of sweetbreads and a half can of mushrooms to 
each pint of white sauce. 

PLAIN PASTE 

Put into a bowl three-quarters of a pound (three cups) of sifted 
pastry flour; add a level teaspoonful of salt and one of sugar; 



564 MRS. RORER^S NEW COOK BOOK 

put into the flour a half pound of butter, cutting it into bits and 
quickly covering each bit with flour. Measure two-thirds of a 
cup of ice water ; add it here and there all over the flour, never 
pouring it twice in the same place. When all is moistened, so 
that it holds together, turn it out on a board, roll quickly from 
you, fold in the sides and then the ends, turn, roll it from 
you again, fold, and roll again. Stand on the ice until wanted. 
This will be lighter if allowed to stand over night. At first, it 
will stick to the rolling pin. Don't use sufficient flour to prevent 
sticking, however, or the pastry will be hard ; let it stick at first ; 
in a moment, it will all cleave together under the weight of the 
roller, and the paste will be light and delicate. This paste may 
be made by using half lard and half butter ; but, of course, it is 
greasy and not so light. However, it makes very little differ- 
ence what fat is used as far as digestion is concerned. Butter, 
perhaps, is quite as injurious as lard, as both are overheated. It 
is not that butter is injurious, or the flour or fruits from which 
the pies are made ; but it is the combination and the manner in 
which they are put together. Butter, however, makes a flaky 
crust, while lard makes a greasy one. This is due to the differ- 
ence in the fats. Digestion is as easily accomplished, however, 
with one as with the other, when made into pastry. 



ENGLISH APPLE TART 

These may be made in deep dishes, using a suet crust on top. 

Fill a deep baking dish with sliced apples, and sprinkle over 
two or three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Free a quarter of a pound 
of suet from all membrane, chop it fine, and add gradually, 
while chopping, two cups (a half pound) of pastry flour ; add a 
half teaspoonful of salt and just sufficient ice water to moisten. 
Knead a moment, and roll it out in a sheet. Put it over the top 
of the apples, making a hole in the centre ; brush with beaten 
egg, and bake in a moderately quick oven one hour. 

Peach or Small Fruit Tarts may be made by using these 
fruits instead of the apples, and a biscuit crust may be substi- 
tuted for the suet.

flour into a bowl; add the baking powder and salt, and sift 
twice ; moisten gradually with the milk. When you have a soft 
dough, roll it out quickly, make a hole in the centre, and place 
it neatly over the apples. The crust may be a quarter of an inch 
thick. Brush the top with milk or beaten white of egg, and 
bake in a moderately quick oven three-quarters of an hour. 
This is very good served with cold milk or milk and cream. 
Other fruits may be substituted for the apples. 



PUMPKIN CUSTARD 

Make a biscuit crust according to the preceding recipe ; roll it 
out thin, and line a deep baking dish. Have ready stewed or 
steamed sufficient pumpkin to make one pint when mashed; 
press it through a sieve. While warm, add a tablespoonful of 
butter, stir in two eggs well beaten with a half cup of sugar, add 
a half teaspoonful of ground ginger and a half pint of milk. 
Turn this into the baking dish, and bake in a moderately quick 
oven one hour.

this, and spread them over the top of the crackers about a quar- 
ter of an inch thick. Beat the remaining whites until they are 
stiff, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and beat again until dry 
and fine. Cover this meringue all over the nuts, heaping it up 
in the centre ; dust thickly with powdered sugar, and dry or 
brown lightly in a cool oven. All or any nuts may be substi- 
tuted for the ones mentioned here ; black walnuts, hickory nuts,

Serve warm. 



de:sse:r.ts 



This term is generally applied to the final sweet at either lunch 
or dinner. Desserts are like unto the ruffles or trimmings on a 
garment; they must be used with judgment or they will spoil 
the entire meal. Avoid heavy desserts where meats have 
formed a large proportion of the dinner ; light desserts not con- 
taining albuminoids are to be preferred. For instance, with 
a roast-beef dinner, do not serve a cup custard or a dessert 
rich in eggs, or the dinner will be unbalanced, containing 
entirely too much nitrogenous foods. Substitute whipped 
cream, light cornstarch, or fruits. With a vegetable dinner, 
serve desserts rich in eggs and milk. Like all other trimmings, 
these can be overdone; a dessert must above all things har- 
monize with the dinner. For instance, do not end a simple 
dinner with an elaborate dessert, and when a dinner is very 
elaborate, it is by far better to omit the dessert and serve coffee, 
wafers and cheese, or an omelette soufflee or syllabub, a dainty, 
light, attractive dish. 

Don't for example, serve apple slump or bread pudding 
with a capon or turkey dinner; nor tapioca, following a baked 
fillet with mushroom sauce. It would be like a velvet gown 
trimmed with calico. 



A GROUP OF COLD PUDDINGS 

These puddings may be made a day before they are needed, 
and consist principally of "gelatin desserts" and those thick- 
ened with cornstarch or eggs. It must be remembered that 
mixtures of egg and milk are liable to ptomaines, which makes 
it very necessary that they should be put to cool in a perfectly 
clean place. It is not an unusual thing for one to hear of per- 
sons made severely ill by eating ice cream, cream custard or 
558 



DESSERTS 559 

boiled custard that has been standing over night. Chicken and 
salmon salads, where the meats have been boiled, are, during 
the warm months, especially liable to these toxic conditions. 

From the various facts collected by our modern chemists, 
we know that all the animal foods must be kept in very clean 
places, clean from a surgical standpoint, not simply swept and 
dusted, but free from conditions that increase the growth of 
bacteria. 

CREAMY PUDDING 

I pint of milk ^ cup of sugar 

4 level tablespoonfuls of corn- 4 eggs

Put the milk in a double boiler, moisten the cornstarch with a 
little extra milk, add it to the hot milk, stir until thick and 
smooth ; add the sugar, and p>our, while hot, over the well 
beaten whites of the eggs ; add the flavoring, turn at once in a 
mold, and stand away to cool. Serve with soft custard sauce 
made from the yolks of the eggs. 

Note. — If this is to be flavored with Chocolate, add two 
ounces of grated chocolate ; mix at the same time you are add- 
ing the cornstarch. 

If it is to be flavored with Coffee, take a half pint of milk 
instead of one pint, and add a half pint of coffee. 

For Vanilla, add a teaspoonful of vanilla, just as you take 
it from the fire. 

For Lemon or Orange, add the grated yellow rind to the 
milk before you add the cornstarch. 

For Cocoanut, add a half pint of grated cocoanut with the 
vanilla.

fectly dry. Strain it through a cheese cloth. Turn this milk 
in a double boiler, add the cornstarch, moistened in a little cold 
water; add the sugar, stir until smooth and thick, and pour 
while hot into the well beaten whites of the four eggs. Turn 
into a mold, and stand at once in a cool place. Serve with soft 
custard made from the yolks of the eggs and a pint of cocoanut 
milk.

Blanch the almonds and chop them very fine ; add them to the 
milk, put into a double boiler, and when hot add the cornstarch 
moistened in six or eight tablespoonfuls of cold milk. Cook 
until smooth. Add the sugar and turn into individual molds 
that have been moistened in cold water. Stand aside on the ice 
until cold. When they are cold, turn these carefully into indi- 
vidual dishes, garnish with candied cherries, or pineapple or 
both, and send to the table with plain cream. 



FRENCH FLOATING ISLAND 

6 eggs Yt. cup of sugar 

1 quart of milk i teaspoonful of vanilla 

2 tablespoonfuls of powdered 24 almonds, blanched, dried and 

sugar chopped fine. 

Separate the eggs. Beat the whites until light and frothy but 
not dry; add the sugar and beat until fine and glossy. Drop 
by teaspoonfuls on a pan of hot water. Lift with a skimmer 
and put on a plate to cool. The better method is to have at the 
side of the pan of water on the stove a plate and skimmer. 
Drop the spoonfuls on top of the water and take them out in 
the rotation that you dropped them. Then drop a few 
more teaspoonfuls, and so on until the whole has been cooked. 



DESSERTS 561 

Keep the whites in as compact a form as possible. Put the 
milk in a double boiler, beat the yolks of the eggs and sugar 
together, add to them, slowly, the hot milk. Turn it in the 
double boiler, and cook until the custard sticks to a knife blade 
or until it begins to thicken. If cooked a moment too long it 
will curdle. Add the vanilla, and, when cool, turn it into the 
serving dish, a flat round glass dish if possible. Heap the 
whites on top in a pyramid. Dust thickly with the chopped 
almonds and send to the table. This may also be garnished 
with candied cherries, blocks of candied pineapple or home- 
made preserves or jelly. 



PARSON'S SPONGE 

Line a glass dish with lady fingers or pieces of stale sponge 
cake. Sprinkle over thickly a mixture of chopped nuts. Pour

2 eggs 


2 tablespoonfuls of granulated 


Yz cup of stale bread crumbs

10 drops of bitter almond 





Pare the peaches, cut them into slices, and put in the bottom 
of a small serving dish. Put the milk in a double boiler over 
the fire. Separate the eggs ; beat the yolks with granulated 
sugar. Add to them, gradually, the hot milk. Turn this into 
the double boiler. Cook just a moment until it sticks to a knife 
blade. Take from the fire, stir in half the bread crumbs, and 
add the flavoring. Reserve from the remaining bread crumbs 
one tablespoon ful, and put the rest over the peaches in the dish. 
Pour the custard on top. Beat the whites of the eggs stiflF and 
frothy ; add the powdered sugar and beat again. Drop these by

teaspoonfiils on hot water, lift with a skimmer, drain and slip 
them at once on top of the pudding. Dust with the tablespoon- 
ful of bread crumbs, and stand aside until cold. Stale cake or 
biscuit crumbs may be substituted for bread crumbs. 

CARAMEL CUSTARD 

4 tablespoon fuls of sugar i pint of milk 

3 eggs 
Melt six tablespoonfuls of extra sugar by putting it into an iron 
saucepan over the fire. The sugar will first soften, then grow 
quite moist, breaking down into a molasses-like mixture. It 
should be quite brown. Pour a tablespoonful of this into the 
bottom of each custard cup. While hot and liquid, whirl the 
cups around so that they are fairly lined with this caramel. 
Beat the eggs without separating, until light; add the sugar, 
then the milk. Pour this into the cups on top of the caramel. 
Stand them in. a baking-pan half filled with hot water, and 
bake in the oven about twenty minutes until they are set in the 
centre. Run a spoon handle down in the centre; if it comes 
out clean it is done; if milky you must cook a little longer. 
Take from the oven, let them stand a moment, and turn out 
into an individual saucer. Serve cold. 

BREAD CUSTARD 

3 slices of bread ^ cup of sugar 

4 eggs I quart of milk 

Beat the eggs without separating, add the sugar, then the milk. 
When the sugar is dissolved, pour the mixture into a baking 
dish, cover the top with the bread, butter side up. Bake in a 
moderate oven until set or solid. Serve cold. 

This is an exceedingly nice custard for a children's supper. 

POTATO CUSTARD 

4 good-sized potatoes 4 eggs 

I quart of milk Yz cup of sugar

into the milk. Potatoes, containing malic acid, become discol- 
ored the moment they are exposed to the air. 

Beat the eggs without separating; add the sugar, then add 
this to the milk. Add the cinnamon, and pour the mixture into 
a baking-dish ; bake in a moderate oven about three-quarters 
of an hour. Serve as a dessert, the same as you would any 
other form of custard. 

This pudding may be varied by changing the flavoring; 
vanilla may be added, or half a cup of finely chopped almonds. 
This same mixture may be poured into pie dishes lined with 
paste and baked in the oven under the name of white potato 
pie. The whites are usually reserved and made into a meringue 
to put over the top at the last minute. 

Without the sugar and cinnamon, this may be served in 
the place of meat at luncheon or supper. A half cup of grated 
cheese will give it a greater meat value. 

CHESTNUT CREAMS 

I pint of chestnuts i teaspoonful of vanilla 

I pint of cream y^ cup of powdered sugar 

Scald the chestnuts and remove the brown skins. Cover them 
with boiling water, add the juice of half a lemon, and cook 
until the chestnuts are tender; drain, put the saucepan back 
on the fire, until they are dry; then press them through a col- 
ander. Whip the cream and let it stand for a few minutes ; add 
that which **goes back" to the chestnuts, then add the sugar 
and the vanilla. Fold in carefully the whipped cream, and 
stand aside to cool. Serve heaped on a flat dish.

SPONGES 

"Sponges" are thickened with gelatin. They contain both eggs 
and gelatin, are nitrogenous or muscle-building foods, and 
should be used after a light dinner. One recipe will answer 
for all sponges, the name corresponding with the flavoring. 



COFFEE SPONGE 

^ box (one ounce) gelatin i pint of strong coffee 

Yi cup of sugar Whites of four eggs 

Cover the gelatin with a quarter cup of cold water, and let it 
stand for a half hour ; then add the sugar, and pour over the 
boiling coffee; stir until the gelatin is dissolved. Stand into a 
bowl, and place it in a pan of ice water or cracked ice. Beat 
the whites. Stir the mixture in the bowl until it begins to 
slightly thicken, quickly add the eggs, and with a paddle stir 
from the bottom and sides of the bowl. Keep turning the bowl 
while you are stirring. If the coffee mixture is too thick before 
the cream is added, the sponge will have a lumpy appearance. 
When the sponge begins to stiffen, turn it into a mold, and 
stand aside in a cold place. 

For Chocolate Sponge use, in place of coffee, a pint of 
milk, two ounces of chocolate or two rounding tablespoon fuls 
of cocoa, moistened. Sweeten with the same amount of sugar, 
add the gelatin and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Finish as in pre- 
ceding recipe. 

ORANGE SPONGE 

Yi box of gelatin i pint of orange juice 

I cup of sugar Whites of four eggs 

Soak the gelatin in a half cup of cold water for a half hour. 
Stand it over hot water until dissolved. Add the sugar and then

the orange juice. Beat the whites. Turn the orange mixture 
in a basin. Stand in a pan of ice water, stir for a moment, and 
then turn in the eggs. Stir continuously from the sides and 
bottom of the pan until thoroughly mixed and slightly thick- 
ened. Turn into a mold and stand in a cold place. These are 
to be served without sauce, perfectly plain. 

Strawberry, Raspberry and Currant sponges are made 
in precisely the same way.

Whites of three eggs 



Yz box (one ounce) of gelatin 

I cup of sugar

^ cup of cold water 

Cover the gelatin with the cold water and let it soak a half 
hour; then add the sugar, the boiling water, and the juice of 
two lemons; stir until the sugar is dissolved; add the vanilla, 
strain, and when cold and slightly thickened, drop in the 
unbeaten whites of the eggs, and add the wine. Stand the 
bowl in a pan of ice water and, with an ordinary ^^'g whip, 
beat the mixture until it is white as snow. If the mixture is 
too thin, the gelatin will settle to the bottom. It is a waste of 
time to begin to beat until the mixture is sufficiently congealed 
to hold the air. Turn into a mold, and stand aside until per- 
fectly cold. Serve with soft custard sauce made from the 
yolks of the eggs. 



ST. PETERSBURG WHIP 

Make amber jelly, which may be a coffee or a lemon jelly 
colored with a teaspoonful of caramel ; stand it in a cold place 
over night. Next morning make the recipe for Washington 
sponge. When the pudding is whipped to a stiff froth, turn in 
the mold. Cut the amber jelly in cubes of one inch, carefully stir 
them into the pudding, and turn the mixture in a fancy mold 
that has been dipped in cold water. Stand in a cold place for 
three or four hours. 



666 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

BAVARIAN CREAMS 

These are like the sponges, except that cream is substituted 
for the whites of eggs. These are heat and force foods, rather 
than muscle-building. The first group should be used where 
the dinner was composed largely of vegetable foods. The 
Bavarian creams may be used after meat dinners. 



STRAWBERRY BAVARIAN CREAM 

Mash sufficient strawberries through a colander to make a pint. 
Cover a half box of gelatin with a half cup of cold water, and 
soak a half hour; add half a cup of powdered sugar to the 
strawberry juice, and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Stand 
the gelatin over hot water until melted. Add it to the straw- 
berry juice. Stand the bowl in a pan of ice water or cracked ice, 
and in a moment as it begins to thicken, turn in the cream, 
whipped to a stiff froth. Mix quickly and thoroughly, and turn 
at once into a mold. This should be served plain. All fruit 
juices may be substituted for strawberry juice, using the same 
proportions. 

For Coffee and Chocolate Bavarian Creams, use the 
same proportion as for coffee and chocolate sponge, substitut- 
ing a pint of cream, whipped, for the whites of the eggs. 



CHARLOTTE RUSSE

the whipped cream ; add the flavoring. Stand the bowl in a pan 
of cracked ice or ice water; stir carefully and continuously 
from sides and bottom of the pan until the mixture begins to

The mold may be lined with lady fingers, or it may be turned 
out on a sheet of sponge cake, or it may be served on a layer of 
lady fingers in the bottom of a glass dish. 

NUT CHARLOTTE 

This is made precisely the same as Charlotte Russe, substituting 
a half cup of mixed chopped nuts for the vanilla and wine. 

PRINCESS CHARLOTTE 

Line a perfectly round mold with the rolled wafers. Fasten 
them together with a little melted sugar or dissolved gelatin. 
When perfectly cold, lift from the mold, place them in the serv- 
ing dish, and fill the centre with plain Charlotte Russe. Dust 
the top with grated macaroons or chopped pistachio nuts, or it 
may be garnished with candied fruits. 

JERUSALEM PUDDING 

Yi box of gelatin 4 tablespoonfuls of rice 

1/2 cup of powdered sugar ^ pound of dates 

I pint of cream i teaspoonful of vanilla 

Cover the gelatin with a half cup of cold water, and soak a 
half hour. Wash the rice, throw it in a saucepan of boiling 
water, boil rapidly for thirty minutes, drain, and spread it out 
on a dry towel or napkin. Stone the dates and chop them fine. 
Whip the cream, put it in a bowl, and stand in a pan of ice 
water and cracked ice. Sprinkle over, first, the dry rice, then 
add the dates, then sprinkle over this the sugar, and add the 
vanilla. Stand the gelatin over hot water ; when it is dissolved, 
add it to the cream, and begin at once to stir, and stir continu- 
ously until the whole is well mixed, and the rice can be seen 
throughout the mixture, not sinking in the cream. Turn at 
once into a mold and stand in a cold place. Serve with 
whipped cream, heaped around the base. The pudding may be 
dusted with chopped pistachio nuts, when turned from the 
mold.

or toss it with a fork until it is dry and light. Whip the cream, 
put it in a bowl, stand it in a pan of ice water, and sprinkle 
over the sugar, then the rice. Stand the gelatin over hot water, 
and, when melted, strain it in the warm mixture. Stir at once 
continuously until the whole is thoroughly mixed and the rice 
remains on top of the cream. Turn into mold, and stand in a 
cold place. When ready to serve turn from the mold on a deep 
found dish. Put the quince jelly, with a half pint of water, 
over the fire ; stir until it melts ; stand it aside until cold, then 
strain it over the rice jelly, and send it to the table. Other jel-

stoned, and, if you like, a grating of nutmeg. Turn this into 
a pudding dish, and place in a moderate oven to bake for two 
hours. As soon as the first crust forms, which will take fifteen 
minutes, stir it down, at the same time stirring the rice. Do this 
every fifteen minutes for one hour. Then allow another crust 
to quickly form and brown ; this will take about thirty minutes. 
Take from the fire and stand aside to cool. This, if well made, 
will be of a golden color, rich, creamy and delicious. If you 
are using the oven, you may stand the baking pan on the back 
part of the stove, and let it carefully cook for one hour; then 
put it in the oven to brown. 



RICE AND RAISINS 

I cup of rice i cup of stoned raisins 

Wash the rice through several cold waters, throw it into three 
quarts of boiling water, and boil rapidly for fifteen minutes; 
drain in a colander, and pour over it a pitcher of cold water. 
While this is boiling, cover the raisins with a small quantity 
of boiling water. In a brown bread mold or kettle, put a layer 
of rice, then a sprinkling of raisins, another layer of rice, a 
sprinkling of raisins, and so continue until the materials are 
used. Stand this mold in a kettle of boiling water, cover, and 
boil continuously for thirty minutes. Turn it out carefully on 
a round dish, and serve it with plain milk or cream. 

RICE DUMPLINGS 

5^ pint of rice Fruit 

Wash the rice in several cold waters, throw it into plenty of 
boiling water, and boil rapidly for twenty minutes ; strain. 
Have ready six squares of cheese cloth. Spread some rice in 
the centre of each square, a half inch thick and the size of a 
saucer. In the centre of this place a half peach or apricot, put 
a little rice into the place from which the stone was taken, put 
over the other half, gather up the sides of the cloth so that the 
rice will entirely cover the fruit, and tie tightly. When all are

I box of gelatin ^ pint of cold water 

1 cup of sugar i quart of boiling water 

2 lemons i teaspoonful of caramel 

Cover the gelatin with cold water, and let it soak a half hour. 
Put the sugar in boiling water, and add the grated rind of one 
lemon ; bring to the boiling point, take from the fire, add the 
gelatin, the lemon juice and the caramel ; strain through two 
thicknesses of cheese cloth. Have ready a good-sized mold, 
moistened in cold water. Put a layer of gelatin in the bottom 
of the mold, stand it aside to harden. Allow the remaining 
gelatin to become cold, but not thick. On top of the jelly in 
the mold place a large bunch of grapes or roses or violets, 
according to the meal for which it is to be used. Now pour 
over the remaining jelly that is cold, not hard, and stand the 
mold aside over night. This may be garnished with chopped 
fruits or flowers.

and spice. Now add four tablespoonfuls of butter, mix, pour 
into a baking dish, and put in a moderate oven. As soon as 
the pudding begins to thicken, stir in thoroughly one pint of 
cold milk. Bake slowly for three hours. Serve warm with 
maple syrup or hard sauce. 

BAKED BATTER PUDDING 

Yz pint of cream i tablespoonful of butter 

iYt. cups of flour 2 rounding teaspoonfuls of bak- 

2 eggs ing powder 

Separate the eggs, beat the yolks, add the milk, then the butter, 
melted, then the flour and baking powder sifted together. Beat 
them five minutes and stir in carefully the well beaten whites of 
the eggs. Turn into a shallow greased baking pan, and cover 
the top with fruit ; dust with four tablespoonfuls of granulated 
sugar, and bake in a quick oven thirty minutes. Serve warm 
with hard sauce or with plain milk or cream. 

If Peaches are used, cut them into halves, removing the 
stone ; press them, rounding side up, into the batter. 

For Apple Pudding, pare, core and quarter the apples, and 
use them the same as the peaches. 

Blackberries, Raspberries, Cherries and Huckleber- 
ries, may all in turn be used. Thus you have from this one 
recipe six different puddings. 

Note. — Have the pan sufficiently large to hold the batter, 
not over an inch thick. 

CREAM PUDDING 

6 tart apples 23/2 cups of flour 

I pint of sour cream i level teaspoonful of soda 

Pare, cut and quarter the apples. Dissolve the soda in two 
tablespoonfuls of warm water ; add the cream ; mix until foam- 
ing; add the flour, and beat until smooth. Pour this into the 
bottom of a greased baking pan which has been nearly filled 
with the apples. Bake in a moderately quick oven one hour. 
Serve hot, with hard sauce or milk.

If sour milk is used in place of sour cream, add one table- 
spoonful of creamed butter. This would also be true of butter- 
milk. 

BRIOCHE 

5 ounces of butter i yeast cake 

j/2 pound of flour 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar 

5 eggs 2 tablespoonfuls of milk 

Dissolve the yeast cake in a quarter cup of warm water, stir 
in sufficient flour to make a biscuit, cut the biscuit across the 
top and drop it into a pitcher nearly filled with warm water. 
Put the flour into a bowl ; make a well in the centre, into which 
put the butter, sugar, milk and the eggs, well beaten. By this 
time the biscuit will have come to the surface of the water in 
the pitcher. Lift the biscuit with a skimmer, and put it in with 
the other ingredients. Now, with your two fingers and thumb, 
work all together, taking in gradually the flour. Work it 
lightly but thoroughly, as you would bread. Cover the bowl 
and stand it in a warm place (75° Fahr.) for four hours, or in 
a cooler place over night. When light, turn it out and roll it 
carefully into a long thick roll. Put the two ends together, 
twist it like rope, and fold it around in a Turk's head, keeping 
it well twisted; or you may put it in a small round mold. 
Cover and stand in a warm place for about two and a half 
hours, or until it is very light. Bake in a quick oven three- 
quarters of an hour. Serve warm with puree of apricot or 
peaches. 

Note. — When this batter is thoroughly twisted, baked in 
individual molds, and served with a brandy sauce, it is Baba or 
Wine Cakes.

574 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Add the baking powder and the salt to the flour, sift them 
three or four times ; add the nuts, mix thoroughly and add the 
milk. Add each slowly, as the dough must be moist, but not 
wet. Knead quickly, roll out into a sheet one-half inch in 
thickness, cut into strips one inch wide and twelve inches long ; 
roll them quickly around a cannelon mold, brush them on top 
with milk or the yolk of an egg, dust lightly with granulated 
sugar, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. Slightly 
sweeten the fruit. When the cannelons are done, remove the 
molds, fill these spaces with fruit, heap them on a platter, and 
send at once to the table with a pitcher of cream or milk.

the raisins, seeded and floured. Turn into a greased mold or 
ordinary lard pail, cover, stand in a pot containing about four 
inches of boiling water, cover the pot, and boil contmuously 
for two and a half hours. It is always well to protect the bot- 
tom of the pot with an iron stand or rack, to remove the dan- 
ger of burning. Serve warm with fruit sauce. 

Huckleberries, dried currants, chopped dates or figs may be 
substituted for the raisins.

it into a large round or oblong cake. Put it at once into a 
greased baking pan. Brush the top with milk and bake in a 
quick oven for twenty minutes. Stem and mash the berries, 
and add a cup of sugar. As soon as the short-cake is thor- 
oughly baked, take it from the oven, separate by pulling it 
apart, do not cut it, lay the top crust aside and put half the 
strawberries over the under crust. Put on the top crust, and 
cover it with the remaining berries. Send at once to the table. 
Serve with it, if possible, a pitcher of cream. Milk cannot be 
substituted ; better eat it plain, than to mix milk with the ber- 
ries. 

For Blackberry, Raspberry and Peach Short-cake, 
substitute these fruits for the strawberries. 



OATMEAL PUDDING 

I pint of milk 4 eggs 

y^ pint of cold cooked oatmeal Yz cup of corn meal

ENGLISH BREAD PUDDING 

I pint of soft bread crumbs 2 eggs 

3/2 cup of dried currants or rais- 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar 
ins 13^ cups of milk 

Grease small custard cups or an ordinary baking pan, and 
put in the bread crumbs. The better way to make the crumbs, 
is to take a whole slice and roll it between the hands. The 
fruit may be mixed with the crumbs or it may be spread on top 
or on the bottom of the pan. If it is used over the top, it will, 
of course, form a bottom layer when the pudding is turned out, 
giving a good appearance. Beat the eggs without separating, 
add the sugar and then the milk. When the sugar is dissolved, 
pour carefully over the bread crumbs. Let this stand ten min- 
utes, and place it in a shallow baking pan, partly filled with 
water. Bake in a quick oven fifteen or twenty minutes. The 
mixture must be "set" in the centre. Turn out carefully and 
serve with a liquid pudding sauce.

SLUMP 

I pint of flour 2 cups of milk 

I teaspoonful of baking powder Fruit 

Under this head we give a general recipe for slump made from 
the various kinds of fruit. The fruit is cooked over the fire. 
When nearly done cover it with the crust, cover carefully the 
kettle, and cook continuously for twenty minutes, without lift- 
ing the lid. The mixture is simple, easily digested and pal- 
atable. It may be served with cream or milk, or eaten plain. 

Put the flour into a bowl, add the baking-powder, sift once 
or twice, then add gradually the milk. Turn the dough on the 
board; roll in a sheet a half inch thick; cut it in biscuits, and 
stand these over the fruit. 

For Apple Slump, pare, core and quarter the apples, cover 
them with water, add two or three tablespoonfuls of sugar ; 
stew until tender; place over the biscuits or crust; cover, and 
cook ten minutes without lifting the lid. 

Peaches, Blackberries, Huckleberries, may be used in 
the place of apples. Apples and peaches, however, are to be 
preferred.

oven (300° Fahr.) for thirty minutes. If the oven is too hot, 
the puffs will not be light. They must bake until they are like 
little balloons. If they fall when taken from the oven, they 
are not done. Serve warm with liquid pudding sauce.

Stand these cups in a shallow pan half filled with water, and 
bake in a moderately quick oven twenty minutes. When done, 
remove them carefully into individual saucers. Serve with

OMELETTE SOUFFLEE

powdered 



The grated yellow rind of half 

a lemon 
^ teaspoonful of lemon juice 



Beat the whites of the eggs until stiflf and frothy ; sift over the 
sugar and beat again until fine and dry ; add the yolks slightly 
beaten, the lemon rind and juice. Mix quickly, carefully and 
thoroughly, put at once into a baking dish, dust the top thickly 
with powdered sugar, and bake in an oven at 400° Fahr. five 
minutes. 

Caution. — The oven must be ready before you begin the 



680 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

soufflee. It must be taken at once from the oven to the table. If 
it is stringy inside, it has been baked too long. To be right, it 
must be hot but soft. It must be served in the dish in which it 
is baked. 

If you are an expert, put the soufflee into pastry, use a star 
tube, and press it out on a platter, making either a large 
rope-like mound, or rosettes. A pyramid of roses is always 
attractive. Dust it with sugar and bake as directed. An ome- 
lette soufflee is one of the most elegant of desserts. 



PRUNE SOUFFLE

the top with powdered sugar, and bake in a quick oven five to 
six minutes. Other fruit in the same proportion may be substi- 
tuted for prunes.

This recipe will answer for Pears, Peaches, Apricots or 
the large Plums. 

ROLY POLY 

The filling of this pudding may be composed of any suitable 
materials that one has in the house.

Add the baking-powder and salt to the flour, sift once or 



DESSERTS ^85 

twice, add the water carefully. The dough must be soft, not 
wet. Knead quickly and roll out into a very thin sheet. Brush 
with melted butter or melted suet or oil. Sprinkle over black- 
berries, huckleberries, raspberries, currants, or chopped dates, 
figs and raisins ; in fact, almost any combination of fruits may 
be used. Sprinkle with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and roll 
up ; place in a baking-pan ; brush the roll with water, and bake 
in a moderately quick oven three-quarters of an hour. After 
the roll has been baking a half hour, draw it from the oven, 
brush it quickly with a tablespoonful of sugar dissolved in two 
tablespoonfuls of water, and return to glaze. Serve hot with 
hard sauce; or it may be served with sugar. 

If dry fruits are used for roly poly, they must be soaked 
over night and chopped fine in the morning. Do not cook them 
before putting them into the pudding. 

STRAWBERRY SAGO 

Wash a half pint of sago through several cold waters, cover 
with a pint and a half of cold water, and soak for two hours. 
Cook in a double boiler until transparent. Stem and wash 
strawberries, put them into a serving dish. When the tapioca 
is cool, not cold, pour it over the berries, and stand aside until 
perfectly cold. Serve with sugar. 

Raspberries, Blackberries, Huckleberries and Pine- 
apple may be used in the place of strawberries. 

PINEAPPLE a riMPERATRICE 

Pare and pick a pineapple into small pieces with a fork, reject- 
ing the core ; cover it with six tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
stand aside for one hour. Wash through several cold waters a 
half pint of rice ; throw it into three quarts of boiling water, boil 
rapidly for thirty minutes, drain in a colander, stand at the oven 
door a moment until perfectly dry. Heap this in the centre of 
a flat dish, making it a little smooth over the top, arrange over 
it the pineapple, baste it with syrup, and send at once to the 
table. 

Peaches, Apricots, Pears or Apples may be used in the 
same way.

GRAPE SAGO 

Yz pint of grape juice 



Yz pint of sago 
lYz pints of cold water Y^ pint of sugar 

Wash the sago, cover 't with cold water and soak over night. 
In the morning, cook in a double boiler until transparent ; add 
the sugar and grape juice. When cool, turn it in a glass dish, 
stand aside until perfectly cold. This may be served with plain 
sauce made of slightly sweetened grape juice. 

Where grape juice cannot be obtained, Currant, Rasp- 
berry or Blackberry Jelly may be substituted. Thin a tum- 
bler of jelly with a half pint of hot water. 

FLUMMERIES 

Flummery is thickened fruit. The small fruits are always 
lo be preferred. Put a pint of blackberries in a pint of water 
over the fire, bring to boiling point and add two rounding table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch moistened in six tablespoonfuls of 
water ; bring again to boiling point, stirring constantly ; add a 
half cup of sugar and turn out to cool. This may be eaten plain 
or with milk if it is accessible. 

Other small fruits may be substituted for blackberries. 

GINGER SPONGE SLICES

it and the spice to the flour ; dissolve the soda in two tablespoon- 
fiils of the water, and add it with the remaining water to the 
molasses. Mix and then stir in the flour. Beat well, turn into 
a well-buttered mold or kettle, and steam or boil for four hours. 
Currants, raisins or citrons may be floured and added to this 
pudding. Serve warm with hard or liquid pudding sauce. 

ORANGE WHIP 

Yz box of gelatin (one ounce) ^2 cup of cold water 

I pint of orange juice ^ cup of sugar 

Cover the gelatin with the cold water, let it soak for half an 
hour, stand it over hot water until dissolved. Add the sugar, 
stir until melted, and strain this into the orange juice. Stand 
aside until partly jellied, then whip with an ordinary t.^'g beater 
until the whole mixture is like the white of beaten t.%%. Turn 
at once into a mold, stand away to harden. This is to be served 
plain or with a compote of oranges. 

This recipe will answer for all "whips," using precisely the 
same proportions. For instance, use a pint of Strawberry or 
Raspberry juice or a tumbler of jelly melted in hot water. In 
case of using preserves or jams with water, add the juice of a 
lemon or the mixture will be flat and too sweet. 

GLAZED FRUIT BALLS 

Cut slices of cake into rounds about two inches in diameter; 
heap on top of each a pyramid of either canned or fresh fruit, 
such as pineapples, peaches or cherries, or any mixed candied 
fruits that have been soaked in orange juice. Mix a tablespoon- 
ful of arrowroot in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, add a half 
pint of boiling water and a tablespoonful of sugar, cook a 
moment, take from the fire, and add a tablespoonful of maras- 
chino. When partly cool, baste it over the fruit mounds, allow 
them to stand for a few minutes, then lift on individual plates, 
and stand in a very cold place. If made properly, the arrow- 
root will form a thin covering over the entire dessert. Pass 
with a pitcher of soft custard sauce.

APPLE TAPIOCA 

Wash a half pint of granulated tapioca through several cold 
waters, cover with a pint and a half of cold water, soak for 
thirty minutes, and cook in a double boiler until perfectly trans- 
parent. While this is cooking, pare and core six or seven 
apples, put them in a baking dish, pour over the tapioca, cover 
the dish, and bake in a moderate oven thirty minutes, or until 
the apples are tender. Remove the lid for about ten minutes to 
slightly brown the surface. 

Sago, Manioca and the larger tapioca may be used in the 
same way. 

Peaches, Pears, Plums or Apricots may be substituted 
for the apples. Either dried or canned fruits may be used. 
Dried fruits must be soaked, not cooked. 

APPLE OMELET 

Separate four eggs ; beat the whites to a very stiff froth ; then 
add the yolks and beat again, adding gradually two tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar. Have ready an omelet-pan, in which 
you have melted a tablespoonful of butter ; put in the mixture ; 
when it begins to thicken, spread over a layer of apple sauce. 
Fold, turn out and serve at once with powdered sugar.

when cool, add sufficient sweet milk, about one pint, to make a 
very soft batter. Stir in the apples, turn the mixture into a 
greased shallow pan ; cover and bake in a moderate oven for at 
least two hours. This same recipe may be turned into a mold, 
steamed three hours and used as a pudding. 

NEW APPLE DOWDY 

Line a baking dish with thin slices of brown bread and butter. 
Fill in the space with apples, pared, cored and sliced ; sprinkle 
over the top half a teaspoonful of cinnamon and four table- 
spoonfuls of dark brown sugar ; pour over half a cup of water ; 
cover the top with another layer of brown bread and butter, 
butter side up. Bake slowly one hour in a moderate oven. 
Serve with liquid sauce. 

SCALLOPED APPLES 

Pare and cut the apples into slices ; put them in a baking-pan 
with a layer of coarse bread crumbs between each layer of 
apples, having the top layer crumbs. Put two tablespoonfuls 
of molasses into half a cup of water; pour the mixture over, 
and bake in a moderate oven. Serve warm as dessert. 



STEAMED APPLE PUDDING 

Line a mold with slices of bread and butter, put in a layer of 
stewed apples, another layer of bread and butter, another layer 
of apples, and so continue until you have the mold filled. Beat 
two eggs, add a pint of milk ; pour this over the bread and 
apple; steam one hour, and serve with a liquid pudding sauce. 



APPLES AND RICE 

A simple dessert may be made from apples and rice. Pare and 
core tbe apples, stand them in a baking dish ; fill the spaces 
from which the cores were taken with chopped raisins and

Peel and core tart apples, fill the spaces from which the cores 
were taken with seeded raisins, bits of shredded citron, sugar 
and a little lemon peel ; stand them in a baking-pan, pour over 
them half a cupful of water, dust the apples with about two 
tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar; bake in a slow oven until 
perfectly tender ; draw them to the oven door and sprinkle bread 
crumbs over the top ; dust again with sugar, and allow them to 
remain in the oven for ten minutes. While they are baking, mix 
a tablespoonful of flour with a half cupful of sugar ; pour over 
half a pint of boiling water, and boil a moment ; take from the 
fire, and pour slowly over one well-beaten egg; add the juice 
of half a lemon. Pour over the apples and serve warm. 

APPLE FLOAT 

Pare two good-sized tart apples. Beat the whites of four eggs 
to a stiff froth ; add four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and 
beat until fine and dry. Grate the apples into this mixture a 
little at a time, beating all the while. Have ready a good-sized 
glass dish partly filled with plain cream ; heap the float by table- 
spoonfuls over the surface, and dot here and there with candied 
cherries. A simple dessert. 

APPLE SNOW 

Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth ; then add slowly 
five or six tablespoonfuls of stewed apples, and float on either 
custard or plain cream.

rub into the mixture one tablespoonful of butter, and add suf- 
ficient milk to make a soft dough. Roll out in a sheet half an 
inch thick ; cut with a biscuit cutter into circles. Put two table- 
spoonfuls of stewed apples on one-half the dough ; fold over 
the other half, pinch the edges together ; place these in a baking- 
pan, brush with milk, and bake for twenty minutes. 

GERMAN COMPOTE 

Peel and core the apples ; keep them whole ; throw each one as 
it is finished into a bowl of cold water to prevent discoloration. 
Place them in a baking-dish, fill the cavities with orange mar- 
malade, pour over sufficient water to almost cover the apples, 
and add a little grated lemon rind. Cover, and cook until the 
apples are tender. Remove each carefully to a flat glass dish. 
Moisten a teaspoon ful of arrowroot ; add it to the liquor, assum- 
ing there is a half pint ; if more, add a second teaspoon ful ; 
bring to boiling point, then stir in a tablespoonful of orange 
marmalade; pour this over the apples, garnish the dish with 
squares of toasted bread, and serve warm. 

APPLE CUSTARD 

I pint of apple pulp Yz cup of sugar 

4 eggs I pint of milk 

Grate sufficient apples to make one pint of pulp. Separate the 
eggs ; add the sugar to the yolks ; beat, add the hot milk, cook 
for a moment, take from the fire, and add the apple, gradually, 
or the milk may curdle. Turn this into the dish in which it is 
to be served. Beat the whites of the eggs rather stiff ; add to 
them three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, beat again, and 
heap over the apple.

press through a colander ; add while hot the butter, the yolks of 
the eggs, sugar and milk. Turn this into baking-cups, and bake 
for twenty minutes. Beat the whites of the eggs until stiff, 
add sugar, beat again, heap over the top of the cups; dust 
thickly with powdered sugar, and brown a moment in the oven. 
Serve cold. 

APPLE CHARLOTTE 

Cover a half box of gelatin with half a cup of cold water and 
soak for half an hour. Whip one pint of cream, turn it in a 
basin, and place in another of cracked ice; add half a cup of 
powdered sugar, a tablespoonful of lemon juice and two good- 
sized apples grated. Dissolve the gelatin over hot water, and 
strain it into the mixture ; stir quickly but carefully until thor- 
oughly mixed. Turn into a mold and stand away until cool. 

A PLAIN CHARLOTTE 

Add a quarter of a box of gelatin to one pint of stewed apples 
that have been sweetened, flavored and pressed through a sieve. 
As soon as the mixture begins to congeal, stir in carefully one 
pint of cream whipped to a stiff froth. Line the mold with 
lady-fingers ; turn in the mixture, and stand away to cool. 

APPLE RICE PUDDING 

I cup of rice 4 good-sized tart apples 

Wash the rice through several cold waters, throw it into two 
quarts of boiling water, boil rapidly fifteen minutes, drain. 
Spread this in the centre of a good-sized square of cheese cloth. 
The rice should cover a space larger than a dinner plate, and the 
layer should be one-half inch thick. Heap in the centre of this 
the apples, pared, cored and quartered ; gather up the ends and 
sides of the cloth so that the rice will thoroughly cover the 
apples ; tie tightly. Put the pudding in a good-sized kettle of 
boiling water, boil for one hour. Serve hot with maple syrup, 
molasses or plain fruit sauce. If handled carefully, this will 
come out perfectly round without the grains of rice falling 
apart.

through a sieve. Cover the gelatin with a half cup of cold 
water, and allow it to soak a half hour. Add the hot, strained 
apples and the lemon juice. Mix, turn into a mold, and stand 
aside to harden. This may be served plain or with cider sauce. 
Where cider cannot be procured, water may be used in its place. 

JELLIES FROM GELATIN 

Under this heading we place the jellies that are made from the 
ordinary commercial gelatin, flavored with different materials 
and made for immediate use. They are distinct from fruit jel- 
lies made from fruit syrup and sugar. We know so little about 
the food value of gelatin that one cannot say whether or not 
these jellies are nutritious or even beneficial beyond the sugar 
and flavoring they contain. They sometimes form a good 
vehicle for sugar and stimulants in sickness where such foods 
are allowed. Tliey are easily made, and usually with such 
materials as are constantly at hand, hence, they are good 



694 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

emergency desserts. The ordinary commercial gelatin is 
put up in small boxes weighing two ounces. The differ- 
ence in size is due to the different methods of packing. 
Granulated gelatin will occupy a smaller space than shredded 
gelatin. In speaking of a box of gelatin, we always mean two 
ounces. This amount will make a quart and a half of jelly, 
counting the water used for soaking. All gelatin is clarified 
before packing, which removes the necessity of a second clari- 
fying, unless the materials used for flavoring cloud the mixture. 
Sometimes the pulp of lemon or orange will make the mixture 
decidedly cloudy ; it must then be clarified to be sparkling and 
brilliant. Gelatin must always be soaked with a small amount 
of cold water before adding the flavoring and boiling water. 
It should be strained through two thicknesses of cheese cloth. 

To clarify, add to the mixture after the gelatin has been dis- 
solved, flavored and sweetened, the beaten whites and shells of 
two eggs ; beat the whole for a moment, and stand the saucepan 
over the fire ; bring to boiling point, boil rapidly about two min- 
utes, then slowly for five minutes longer. Pour gradually into 
a jelly bag or through two thicknesses of cheese cloth placed in 
a sieve. If the first that runs through is not clear, turn it back 
and strain the second time. Do not press, jar or stir. Allow it 
to drip very slowly. 

To mold jellies, dip the molds into cold water, shake them, 
do not dry or wipe, and turn in the jelly. Stand them aside 
where they will cool quickly. This will take four or five hours 
in an ordinary refrigerator. If needed in two hours, pack them 
in ice with a little salt. When ready to serve, loosen the edge 
of the gelatin from the mold with a knife, plunge it in hot water 
for just a moment, lift, turn it sidewise until you can see to the 
very bottom of the mold ; then place the lower edge of the mold 
in the proper position on the serving dish, turn it over and lift 
it carefully from the jelly. 

TO LINE A MOLD WITH JELLY 

Charlotte Russe, Bavarian creams, in fact, very many cream 
desserts, are handsomer if served in a cover of gelatin. To do

this, select two molds of the same shape, one smaller than the 
other. Put a layer of the liquid gelatin in the bottom of the 
larger mold, have it packed in ice that it may quickly harden. 
When hard and firm, dip the smaller mold in cold water and 
stand it on top of the gelatin in the middle of the large mold. 
Fill the inner mold with cracked ice, then the space between the 
two molds with liquid but cold gelatin, and allow the jelly to 
stand at least two hours until it is perfectly firm. Try to have 
the same thickness at the bottom and sides. When ready to fill, 
remove the cracked ice, and carefully dip the water from the 
inner mold. Wring from hot water a piece of cheese cloth, wipe 
the mold on the inside with the warm cloth, loosen it around the 
top, and slide it out. Fill the space with the pudding or cream, 
and allow the whole to stand in the cracked ice for about two 
hours. At serving time, plunge the mold into warm water, 
loosen it carefully, and turn it out. 

A very dainty mold is made by filling Pistachio Jelly with 
strawberry Bavarian cream, or Orange Jelly with strawberry 
Bavarian cream, or Amber Jelly with orange cream. Any 
suitable combination may be used, to match the color scheme of 
the table. These handsome jellies are always more beautiful 
when served in a flat dish, cut glass, of course, being preferable. 

Dark jellies, as amber, brandy or coffee jelly, are more 
sightly when served in a base of whipped cream. Lemon and 
orange jellies form nice desserts when served with soft custard 
sauce. 

COOKING SCHOOL JELLY 

Line a Charlotte mold with orange jelly. Whip a pint of cream. 
Wash two tablespoonfuls of rice, throw into a quart of boiling 
water, and boil rapidly a half hour. Drain, dry and throw it in 
a napkin, so that each grain will be separate. Chop fine a quar- 
ter pound of dates. Cover a half box of gelatin with a half cup 
of cold water ; soak for half an hour. Turn the whipped cream 
into a bowl, and sprinkle with a half cup of powdered sugar. 
Stand the bowl in a pan of cracked ice or ice water. Now add 
the rice, the chopped dates, and one teaspoonful of vanilla, and, 



696 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

if you use wine, four tablespoon fuls of sherry. Stand the gela- 
tin over hot water ; when melted strain it into the cream, begin 
to stir at once, and stir continuously until the cream begins to 
thicken. Remove the inside mold, fill the space quickly with this 
fruit pudding, and stand aside in a cold place for two hours. 
When ready to serve, turn it on a flat glass dish. Garnish the 
base with whipped cream, dotted here and there with candied 
cherries. 

GELATIN TUMBLERS 

These are made by lining tumblers according to the directions 
for lining molds, using a perfectly clear gelatin. After the 
tumblers are cold and solid, fill the centres with a mixture of 
chopped fruit or with Charlotte Russe, or cream pudding of 
any sort. Plunge the tumblers in hot water and take them out 
carefully. Stand them quickly in serving saucers. I have, 
with care, taken out these linings, put them on little paper mats 
in individual dishes, and filled them, by the use of a forcing 
tube, with orange cream, orange souffle or frozen desserts.

Stone the dates and chop them with the figs rather fine. 
Cover the gelatin with cold water, let it soak for half an hour, 
add the sugar and then the boiling water and lemon juice. Put 
the dates and figs into a bowl, and add gradually the liquid. 
When well mixed turn into molds and stand aside to harden. 
This may be served plain or with whipped cream. 

It may also be changed or modified by adding chopped nuts, 
as pecan nuts, English walnuts, or almonds in proportion of 
one cup of finely chopped nuts to the recipe given. 

TO MOLD FRUIT IN JELLY 

Fruits and flowers may be molded in the jelly. They do not in 
any way contribute to its flavor, but simply to its appearance. 

With red or pink roses, use rose or orange flavoring. In 
lemon jelly, yellow roses. Sprigs or leaves of mint, or pistachio 
nuts with green jelly. 

A bunch of grapes or bananas molded in lemon jelly makes 
an attractive dessert. Allow to each box of gelatin a half pint 
of cold water, one quart of boiling water, a half pint of sugar, 
the juice of three lemons. If you use wine, add at the last 
moment a half pint of sherry : allow for the measure. Cover the 
gelatin with cold water, then add the sugar and the boiling 
water. Add the lemon juice, strain through two thicknesses of 
cheese cloth ; pour into a large mold, that has been dipped in 
cold water, a layer of this and stand aside to harden. Allow 
the remaining jelly to cool, but not congeal: in fact, it must 
be just a little warm. In this way it melts the surface of the 



598 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

jelly in the mold, and the two are welded together. This pre- 
vents breakage in turning out. When the layer is hard, 
arrange on it a large bunch of white or Tokay grapes. Do 
not forget that in turning the mold out, the bottom will be the 
top. Pour around the grapes the remaining quantity of gelatin, 
and stand away to harden. 

All fruits and flowers are molded in the same way.

Clarify with the whites of two eggs. Beat them slightly, add 
them to the gelatin, stir for a moment, bring to boiling point, 
then push to the back of the stove to cook slowly five minutes. 
Strain through a jelly bag, or two thicknesses of cheese cloth. 
Add the brandy, and turn into molds that have been rinsed with 
cold water. Stand it in a very cold place for four or five hours. 
To remove the jelly from the mold, dip the mold lightly into 
warm water, loosen it around the side, and shake until you 
can see to the bottom of the mold inside, and turn it quickly on 
the serving dish.

All Wine Jellies are made after this fashion. 

Sherry or Claret may be substituted for the brandy, using 
twice the quantity and a Httle less boiling water. Claret jelly is 
frequently served with game. 



ORANGES FILLED WITH JELLY 

Make a small opening at the stem end of each orange and care- 
fully take out the pulp. Use your finger or spoon handle, work- 
ing between the skins. Make a lemon and brandy jelly; color 
the latter with a teaspoonful of caramel. Put a layer in the 
orange skins, which have been washed in cold water. When it 
hardens, put in a deep layer of the lemon jelly, and when this 
hardens, pour on top a layer of the brandy jelly. The jellies 
must be kept in a liquid condition, cool but not cold. Stand 
them in a pan of meal or flour to prevent tilting, and then in a 
cold place for two to four hours, or they may stand over night. 
At serving time cut them with a sharp knife into halves, and 
then into quarters. Dish them on a flat glass dish, and garnish 
with natural flowers. 

Lemon Jelly may also be cut into blocks, and heaped into 
orange baskets ; these placed on mats of maidenhair or a dainty 
doily.

prunes and take out the seeds or press through a colander. 
Turn the gelatin mixture into a mold, and stand aside for three 
or four hours to harden. Serve with plain or whipped cream.

A GROUP OF FROZEN DESSERTS 

ICE CREAMS AND SHERBETS 

To make good ice cream it is first necessary to have a good 
quality of cream. Scald half the cream to prevent excessive 
swelling. Where fruits are used, they must be mashed and 
added after the cream is frozen. Oily flavorings, as vanilla 
bean, lemon or orange rind should be rubbed with the sugar and 
cooked with part of the cream. In freezing, adjust the handle 
before packing; use one-third as much coarse salt as ice; if too 
much salt is used, the freezing will be done rapidly, making the 
cream buttery and coarse. Or if the cream is turned rapidly 
after it begins to freeze, it will be buttery. To have perfect 
results, the cream must be ice cold before it goes into the freez- 
ing can, and the turning must be even and not too fast. 

PEACH ICE CREAM 

12 mellow peaches i pint of cream 

iy2 cups of granulated sugar 

Put the peaches into a colander or wire basket, plunge them for 
a moment into boiling water, and peel off the skins. Remove 
the stones, and press the peaches through a colander. Add the 
sugar to the cream, and stir over the fire in a double boiler until 
the sugar is dissolved and the cream hot, but not near the boil- 
ing point ; stand aside to cool. When cold, turn it into the can, 
adjust the handle, and pack. Turn now and then until the 
cream is ice cold; then turn slowly until it is frozen. Remove 
the lid, and add the peaches. Cover and adjust the handle, and 
turn slowly until the mixture is again frozen. Remove the 
dasher, replace the lid, fasten the hole in the top with the cork, 
and repack the can, using now half as much salt as you used in 
packing. Drain off the water, cover the top first with a piece of 
brown paper, then with a blanket or carpet. 

The cream will be ready to use in one and a half to two 
hours. 

To make Strawberry Ice Cream, substitute one quart of

SHERBETS 

A Sherbet is a water-ice stirred rapidly during the freezing. 
A Sorbet is a stirred water-ice with a one-egg meringue added 
after the mixture is frozen. 

One recipe will answer tor all forms of sherbets and sor- 
bets. 

ORANGE SHERBET 

6 oranges i pound of sugar 

I lemon l quart of water 

Add the grated yellow rind of three oranges to the sugar ; add 
the water, stir until the sugar is dissolved, and boil five min- 
utes after the mixture begins to boil. Strain, and when cool, 
add a pint of orange juice and the juice of the lemon. Turn 
the mixture into the freezing can. For water-ice stir it now 
and then; let it freeze like wet snow. 

For sherbet, stir it rapidly during the freezing. This will 
make it light and white. 

For a sorbet, beat the white of one egg, add a tablespoonful 
of powdered sugar and beat again. Remove the dasher, add 
the meringue, mix well, cover, and stand aside for one and a 
half hours to ripen. 

For Lemon Sherbet, use the same quantity of water and 
sugar, the rind of two lemons and the juice of six. 

For Mint Sherbet, the same quantity of sugar and water, 
the juice of two lemons, the leaves from two dozen stalks of 
mint chopped fine and pounded to a pulp. 

For Ginger Sherbet, make a lemon sherbet, and after it 
is frozen, add a half pint of preserved ginger, chopped fine. 

For Pineapple Sherbet, boil the sugar and water 
together, add the juice of a lemon and a pint of grated pine- 
apple. 

For Grape Sherbet, add the juice of a lemon and a pint 
of grape juice. 

Boil the sugar and water together each time.

Raspberry, Strawberry and Blackberry Sherbets are 
made the same, adding the juice of two lemons and a pint of 
the fruit juice. The fruit must be mashed, pressed through a 
colander, and then strained. 



FROZEN FRUITS 

The difference between a frozen fruit and a sherbet is that in 
the first the fruit is simply mashed, sweetened and diluted with 
water, while for sherbet the water and sugar are boiled 
together and the fruit juice strained. 

FROZEN STRAWBERRIES 

Mash one quart of strawberries, add a cup and a half of sugfar 
and the juice of one lemon, stand aside for one hour, then add 
one pint of water; turn into a freezer, and freeze the same as 
ordinary ice cream. Turn the dasher slowly. Frozen straw- 
berries may be served in punch-glasses with a little whipped 
cream on top, or plain. 

FRAPPE 

A frappe is much the same as a water ice, partly frozen like 
wet snow; for instance, Cafe Frappe is partly frozen coffee.' 
Lemon Frappe is partly frozen lemonade, etc. 



PARFAIT 

Parfait is frozen whipped cream. Sweeten and flavor the 
cream, whip to a stiff froth, put it in a mold, cover the mold, 
and pack in salt and ice. The cream should be frozen to the 
depth of one and a half inches. The centre will be cold, but 
soft. Bind the joint of the molds, that are to be packed in salt 
and ice, with a strip of muslin dipped in melted suet or par- 
affin. 

Mousse is the same as parfait. 



604 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

A SIMPLE PARFAIT 

A very nice simple way to make parfait, is to add, at serving 
time, whipped cream to ice cream. Serve in glasses. Use one 
pint of good cream to each quart of ice cream. When ready to 
serve, add the cream quite dry, mix quickly, and serve. 
Cafe Parfait made in this fashion is exceedingly good. 

SYLLABUB 

Whip a pint of cream to a stiff froth and stand it on the ice. 
At serving time, fill this into glasses, or serve on a large glass 
dish ; dust thickly with powdered sugar, and sprinkle with 
either chopped almonds, grated macaroons or chopped candied 
fruit. This is one of the few desserts that can be made easily 
and served quickly.

from the fire and when cool, add another pint of uncooked 
cream. Add the bitter almond flavoring, the pistachio nuts 
chopped very, very fine, and about ten drops of green coloring. 
Turn this into a freezer and freeze as ordinary ice cream. 
Whip the remaining pint of cream to a stiff froth, sprinkle into 
it the sultanas that have been soaked in the sherry and drained ; 
remove the dasher from the freezer, and work the pistachio 
cream around the sides and bottom of the can, making a deep 
well. Into this well, put the whipped cream. Fold down a 
little of the ice cream from the sides until the whipped cream 
is covered ; repack the freezer, and stand aside for at least two 
hours. Serve in slices with strawberry sauce. Mash sufficient

Claret Sauce is made in the same manner, using a pint of 
good claret. 

FROZEN PUDDING WITH A COMPOTE OF 
ORANGES 

Yolks of three eggs ^ pound of sugar 

I pint of cream j^ pound of chopped candied 

I pint of water fruit 

Beat the yolks to a cream. Boil the sugar and water, and five 
minutes after they begin to boil, add a little of the syrup to the 
yolks ; mix ; then return it to the saucepan, and beat over the 
fire for about one minute. Take from the fire, stand the sauce- 
pan in a pan of cold water, and beat the mixture until cold, 
changing the water or adding ice. Add to the cold egg mixture 
the chopped fruit. Freeze it slowly until quite hard, then 
remove the dasher and stir in the cream that has been whipped 
to a stiff froth and drained. Cover the can, repack, and stand 
aside for at least two hours. When ready to serve, dip the can 
quickly in a pan of warm water, and turn the pudding on a 
deep round dish. Arrange quickly the compote, and send to 
the table. This is one of the most sightly and palatable of the 
simple frozen puddings.

the syrup will spin a light thread. Take it from the fire, and 
add the oranges ; mix them well with the hot syrup, cover and 
stand aside to cool. Add the sherry to them at serving time. 
They must be very cold or they will melt the pudding. 

TO MOLD ICES OR PUDDINGS 

Have ready a tub of cracked ice, lightly sprinkled with coarse 
salt. This should cover the bottom at least four inches deep. 
Place on it the molds to be used. The creams or puddings are 
frozen rather stiff. Pack them quickly in the molds, cover or 
close the molds, bind the seams with strips of muslin dipped 
in melted paraffin, and cover them completely with ice and 
salt in proportions of one-quarter salt to three-quarters cracked 
ice. To turn out lift each mold, wipe it off carefully, pour over 
cold water ; open the mold, and shake gently. If the cream 
sticks, wipe the mold with a warm cloth.

CAKES 

Cakes contain both carbonaceous and nitrogenous foods ; nitrog- 
enous, in the form of eggs and milk; carbonaceous, in the 
flour, butter and sugar. All ingredients used are perfectly 
wholesome, if used separately, but when mixed together and 
baked, become complex and difficult of digestion. Cakes with- 
out butter are much more wholesome than those with butter, as 
the heating of the butter renders it more difficult of digestion. 
Hence, people with weak digestion can use sponge cake, angel 
food, sunshine cake with greater ease than pound, fruit or layer 
cakes. Cakes are digested in the mouth, stomach and small 
intestines. 

RULES FOR CAKE MAKING 

In making cake, accuracy in measuring the ingredients is abso- 
lutely necessary. Success follows those who give strict atten- 
tion to detail. The baking is usually the most difficult part. 
Eggs must be perfectly fresh ; butter sweet, and flour fine. But- 
ter cakes, as pound cake, cup cake and fruit cake, must be 
baked in a very moderate oven (220° Fahr.), while layer cakes 
may be baked more quickly (from 280° to 300° Fahr.). 
Angels' food and janshine cake should be placed in a very 
cool oven (212° Fahr.), the heat increased slowly for three- 
quarters of an hour, browning at the last. Do not beat the 
butter, sugar and eggs in a tin basin ; it scours the basin, but dis- 
colors the materials. Use a wooden spoon and a white enameled 
bowl. 

Measure everything before beginning. 

Always separate the whites and the yolks of the eggs, unless 
the recipe specifically directs otherwise. 

Beat the butter to a cream before adding the sugar ; then 
beat the sugar and butter until very light before adding the 

eggs. 

613 



614 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

When a recipe calls for a teaspoonful of baking powder, it 
always means a rounding teaspoonful, unless otherwise stated. 

Each teaspoonful of baking powder may be replaced by a 
half teaspoonful of soda (level) and a level teaspoonful of 
cream of tartar sifted with the flour three or four times. 

Dried fruits, as currants and raisins, must be perfectly clean 
and well floured, and added to the cakes at the last moment. 

If fruits sink to the bottom of the cake, the cake is not suf- 
ficiently thick to hold them in place ; add more flour to the batter. 

Cups used for measuring hold a half pint. 

Suet is the best material for greasing cake pans. Butter 
burns easily, sticks and holds the cake to the pan. 

Have the oven ready as soon as the cake is mixed. 

Cookies, thin small cakes as wafers, require a moderately 
quick oven (240° Fahr.) ; molasses cakes, a very moderate oven 
(220° Fahr.), as they scorch easily. 

If you are without a thermometer, and must guess at the 
heat of the oven (a most unsatisfactory way), and you find it 
too hot, quickly lift the lids of the stove and put a pan of cold 
water into the oven. Cakes baked too quickly at first will come 
up in the centre, crack and run over the sides of the pan. It is 
almost impossible to keep them in shape. 

Do not jar the stove, or open and close the oven door until 
the centre of the cake is "set." 

Do not cover a cake with paper ; the paper burns and spoils 
the flavor of the cake. 

Regulate your oven. If necessary to look at a cake while 
baking, do it as quickly as possible, and open and close the door 
carefully. 

In recipes, where time is given for baking, remember it is 
gauged by a thermometer, and it is impossible for you to follow 
correctly without one. Be careful, then, that the cake is thor- 
oughly done before you take it from the oven. If it is not, it 
will tick loudly when you put your ear to it, and will fall when 
taken out, having a heavy streak near the bottom. 

It is always well to line the pans with greased paper for 
fruit cake, pound cake, wedding cake and cakes rich in butter. 



CAKES 615 

When a cake is done, turn it gently on a cake sieve and 
allow it to cool. Do not handle it while hot. 

Do not melt or warm the butter until it is oily. It may be 
slightly softened in warm water.

pound basin. If convenient, steam for three hours, and bake in 
a moderate oven (about 240° Fahr.) for one hour; otherwise, 
it must be put into an oven (212° Fahr.), and baked for three 
hours, increasing the heat to 220° Fahr. during the last hour. 
This cake will keep for months.

cut the peaches into strips ; wash and dry the nuts. Beat the 
butter to a cream, add the sugar, the eggs beaten without sep- 
arating, then all the spices, the orange rind and juice, and lastly 
the flour. Beat until perfectly smooth. Dust the fruit with a 
half cup of flour, and stir it in at the last moment ; pour into a 
round cake pan that has been lined with greased paper. Bake 
in a moderate oven, starting at about 212° Fahr., increasing the 
heat to 260° Fahr. for three hours.

add the boiling water and butter. When the butter is dissolved, 
stir in quickly the flour. Turn it into a shallow baking pan that 
has been lined with paper, and bake in a moderate oven (240° 
Fahr.) for thirty minutes. 



DEVIL'S FOOD 

Yz cup of milk lYi cups of sugar 

4 ounces of chocolate 4 eggs 

Yi cup of butter 2 teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 

3 cups of pastry flour der 

Put in a double boiler four ounces of chocolate and a half pint 
of milk; cook until smooth and thick, and stand aside to cool. 
Beat a half cup of butter to a cream ; add gradually one and a 
half cups of sugar and the yolks of four eggs ; beat until light 
and smooth. Then add the cool chocolate mixture and three 
cups of pastry flour, with which you have sifted two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder. Beat thoroughly for at least five min- 
utes ; then stir in the well beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in 
three or four layers. Put the layers together with soft icing, to 
which you have added a cup of chopped nuts. 

The success of this cake depends upon the flour used. 



COCOA CAKE

y2 cup of cocoa crumbs 

y^ cup of finely chopped al- i lemon 

monds i cup of sugar 

Beat the eggs without separating, the juice and rind of the 
lemon and the sugar together for thirty minutes. Sprinkle in 
carefully the cocoa, and then the almonds that have been 
blanched, dried and chopped fine. Beat again for ten minutes, 
and then dust in carefully the bread crumbs. Line a shallow 
baking pan with greased paper, pour in the mixture, and bake 
in a moderate oven (280° Fahr.) for thirty minutes. Take 
from the oven, allowing the cake to remain in the pan until cool. 



620 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

Cut it directly into halves down the middle, and then into strips 
the width and length of your finger. This cake, not containing 
butter and but little sugar, is much more wholesome than the 
average cake. 

COFFEE CAKE 

I pound of pastry flour 4 tablespoon fuls (four ounces) 

I tablespoonful of sugar of butter 

5 eggs (half pound) 2 tablespoonfuls of milk 

I compressed yeast cake 

Dissolve the yeast cake in a quarter of a cup of warm water, 
and then stir in sufficient flour to make a dough. Knead this 
into a small biscuit, and with a sharp knife make a cross almost 
through, and drop it, cut side up, in a good-sized pitcher, nearly 
filled with warm water. The biscuit will drop directly to the 
bottom, but in a few minutes the warmth and moisture of the 
water will cause the yeast plants to grow, filling the dough with 
carbon dioxid, which will make it sufficiently light to float. 
While this is standing, sift the flour into a good-sized bowl, 
make a hole or well in the centre, into which put the butter, 
sugar, milk, and eggs well beaten. Lift the biscuit with a skim- 
mer and drop it in the mass. Now with the two fingers and 
thumb work the ingredients to a paste, taking in gradually the 
flour. If the flour is of good quaUty, you will have a soft deli- 
cate dough, which can be manipulated lightly in the bowl. If it 
is sufficiently dry to knead on the board, the cake will be coarse, 
and tasteless, and lack the delicacy necessary to this delightful 
cake. Cover the dough and stand in a warm place (75° Fahr.) 
over night or from ten o'clock in the evening until seven o'clock 
in the morning. Dust the baking board very lightly with pastry 
flour; turn out the dough, cut from the mass about two table- 
spoonfuls, and roll it out under your hand, the thickness of your 
little finger, and at least one and a half yards in length ; make it 
a little thinner in the centre, fold the two ends together and roll 
the whole under your hand, thoroughly twisting it rope-like. 
Bring the two ends of this roll together, and place the twists in 
a greased pan, where they cannot touch each other in the bak- 
ing. Cover and stand in a warm place until very light, about

three-quarters of an hour. Brush with the white of an egg and 
water beaten together, and bake in a quick oven (400° Fahr.) 
for fifteen minutes. Take from the oven, and when they are 
slightly cold pour over each a little water icing, or melted sugar. 
Melted Sugar is made by adding a tablespoon ful of hot 
water to a half pound of powdered sugar. Stand this over the 
•fire until it is just moist and sufficiently soft to pour. 

COFFEE GEMS 

4 eggs 2 teaspoonfuls of coffee ex- 

I cup of granulated sugar tract 

I cup of pastry flour 

Beat the eggs in a saucepan; add the coffee extract and then 
the sugar; beat these rapidly over boiling water until the mix- 
ture is slightly warm. Take from the fire, and whip continu- 
ously for fifteen minutes ; then add slowly the sifted pastry flour. 
Have ready tiny gem pans brushed with oil or suet and dusted 
with granulated sugar; half fill them with the cake mixture. 
Bake in a quick oven (about 300° Fahr.) for fifteen minutes, 
and they are ready to use. 

These cakes are usually served warm. 



NUN'S GEMS 

1 cup (half pound) of butter i teaspoonful of vanilla 
Grated yellow rind of one lemon i cup of granulated sugar 

2 cups of pastry flour 5 eggs 

I teaspoonful of baking powder i cup of grated or desiccated 
I saltspoonful of ground cinna- cocoanut 



Beat the butter to a cream ; add gradually the sugar, the yolks 
of the eggs and all the flavoring. When very light, add the flour 
and baking powder that have been sifted together. Fold in 
carefully the cocoanut and the well-beaten whites of the eggs. 
Drop into greased gmi pans or ball molds; bake a half hour 
in an oven at the temperature of 240° Fahr. When done, dust 
with powdered sugar.

GRAHAM WAFERS 

^ cup of butter i level teaspoonful of bi-carbon- 
I cup of sugar ate of soda 

I egg 2 tablespoonfuls of milk 
Graham flour 

Beat the butter to a cream, add the egg well beaten, and grad- 
ually beat in the sugar. Dissolve the soda in a tablespoonful of 
water, and add the mixture to the sugar and milk. Now work 
in sufficient Graham flour (about three cupfuls) to make a very 
stiff dough. Knead until the mixture will hold well together. 
Roll in a very thin sheet, cut into squares, or into wafers one 
inch wide and three inches long. Lift them carefully, place in a 
slightly greased pan, and bake in a moderate oven until thor- 
oughly done, light brown and crisp, about eight minutes. 

OATMEAL WAFERS 

These will be made according to the preceding recipe, using suf- 
ficient rolled oats to make a stiff dough. They are much more 
difficult to make than Graham wafers, but are exceedingly good. 



ROLLED WAFERS 

y2 cup of butter i level teaspoonful of soda 

1 cup of sugar ^ cup of milk 

2 cups of flour 

Beat the butter to a cream, and add gradually the sugar ; when 
these are very light, dissolve the soda in a tablespoonful of 
water, add it to the milk, then add both to the egg and sugar, 
and stir in the flour. Thoroughly clean the bottoms of several 
baking pans, and brush them lightly with oil or suet. Spread 
this mixture over the pans, using them upside down, in the thin- 
nest possible layer. Put them into a moderate oven, and as soon 
as the mixture is baked, take them out, cut down the centre and 
then across, making four wafers. Roll each quickly, over a 
pencil or steel. They must be rolled while hot. 



CAKES 623 

To make Ginger Wafers, add a tablespoon ful of ground 
ginger. 

For Vanilla Wafers, add a teaspoonful of vanilla. 

For Lemon Wafers, add the grated rind of a lemon. 

For Orange Wafers, add the grated rind of an orange. 

For Rose Wafers^ add a drop of cochineal and a teaspoon- 
ful of rose water, and bake the wafers in a very moderate oven, 
so as not to destroy the coloring. 

For Almond Wafers, use almond paste instead of the but- 
ter, and bake in a very moderate oven, that the wafers may be 
almost white. 

For Pistachio Wafers, use half a pound of almond paste 
instead of the butter ; add a few drops of vegetable green, and 
bake carefully. 

For Chocolate Wafers, use four ounces of chocolate and 
half the quantity of butter. Beat the butter, add to it the sugar 
and melted chocolate, and finish according to the first recipe. 
Granulated sugar must be used for all wafers. 

MARSHMALLOW DROPS 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter 23/2 cups of pastry flour 

i^ cups of sugar 2 rounding tablespoonfuls of 

3 eggs baking powder 
I cup of lukewarm water 

Separate the eggs, beat the butter to a cream ; add the yolks, 
then gradually the sugar. When very light, beat the whites of 
the eggs to a stiff froth, and sift the baking powder with the 
flour. Measure the water. Add to the mixture half the water, 
then half the flour ; beat vigorously ; add the remaining half of 
the water and the remaining half of the flour, and beat again. 
Fold in carefully the well beaten whites, and bake in greased 
gem pans in a moderately quick oven, for twenty minutes. 
While these are baking, put a half pound of marshmallows and 
two tablespoonfuls of water into a double boiler, stir until the 
marshmallows are thoroughly dissolved. Then add a table- 
spoonful of granulated gelatin that has been soaked in four 
tablespoonfuls of water for a half hour. Take from the fii^c and 



624 

add a teaspoonful of vanilla. When the cakes are cold, dip the 
rounding portion in the melted marshmallows, turn them upside 
down and stand them away to cool. This icing may be used for 
other cakes. 

SPONGE CUPS 

Whites of ten eggs 2 cups of granulated sugar 

Yolks of six eggs 2 teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
I cup of boiling water der 

3 cups of pastry flour Juice and rind of one lemon 

Beat the whites to a stiff froth. Beat the yolks to a cream, and 
add them to the whites; add the sugar, beat five minutes, and 
add the lemon. Sift the flour and baking powder, and put them 
in the middle of the batter ; pour around the sides of the bowl 
the boiling water ; do not pour it over the flour. Mix and beat 
quickly, and turn at once into greased small gem pans or 
sponge-cake cups. Bake in a moderately quick oven (260° 
Fahr.) twenty minutes. When cool, dip in caramel or marsh- 
mallow icing. 

MACAROONS 

Whites of three eggs i pound of almond paste 

y-2 pound of powdered sugar 

Mix the whites of the eggs gradually with the almond paste. 
When smooth, work in with a spoon or spatula the powdered 
sugar. Beat vigorously for ten minutes. Drop by teaspoonfuls 
on slightly oiled paper; bake in a moderate oven until a light 
brown, about fifteen minutes. Take from the oven, lift the 
paper from the pan, and rest it for a moment on a damp towel ; 
then with a knife remove the macaroons. 



COCOANUT MACAROONS 

Beat the whites of five eggs to a stiff froth ; fold in carefully a 
half pound of powdered sugar sifted, and one and a half cups of 
grated or shredded cocoanut; stir very lightly. Drop by tea- 
spoonfuls on oiled paper, and bake in a slow oven twenty min- 



CAKES 626 

utes. When done, take out of the oven, and, when cold, moisten 
the under side of the paper, and the macaroons may be easily 
loosened. 

NUT KISSES 

Whites of six eggs Yz cup of pecan meats 

12 ounces of powdered sugar 24 Jordan almonds 

12 English walnut meats 

Chop rather fine the blanched, dried almonds, pecan nuts and 
EngHsh walnuts, which should make in all half a pint of chopped 
nuts. Beat the whites to a very stiff froth, stir in, mixing care- 
fully, the powdered sugar, and then sprinkle in the nuts; mix 
lightly and quickly; drop by teaspoonfuls on floured paper. 
Bake in the same way as plain macaroons. 

To make Chocolate Kisses, substitute a quarter of a 
pound of grated chocolate for the half pint of chopped nuts. 



SPRINGERLE 

Stir one pound of pulverized sugar with four eggs for one hour ; 
add one pound of flour, a pinch of powdered ammonium car- 
bonate, and anise seed. Roll to one-quarter inch thickness, press 
with forms, cut and place on napkins powdered with flour, over 
night. Bake in a cool oven. If kept in a stone crock, the 
springerle will remain soft. — Kindness of Dr. F. A. Genth. 



LEBKUCHEN 

Boil four pounds- of honey with an equal amount of sugar, then 
add one pound of split almonds, one pound of citron cut small, 
the grated rinds of four lemons, half an ounce of nutmeg, half 
an ounce of cloves, three ounces of cinnamon. The mass should 
be stirred whilst the above substances are added. Then add one 
tumbler of brandy, and stir into the mixture six pounds of flour. 
Roll out to a quarter inch thickness, keeping the dough warm ; 
cut into small cakes, bake at once in a hot oven and ice with 
lemon icing. — Dr. F. A. Genth.

Yi cup of cold water 
Y, cup of new milk 
^ pound of butter 



34 pound of chocolate 

y^ pound of nut meats, pecans, 
almonds, walnuts or hick- 
ory nuts 



Boil water, milk and molasses five minutes, add sugar and but- 
ter, boil a moment, add chocolate in one piece; do not stir. 
When smooth, try in cold water. If the mixture forms a pretty 
hard ball, take it from the fire, and stir in the nuts chopped. 
When partly cold, use. 



SOFT FILLING 

Boil one cupful of sugar and half a cupful of water until they 
spin a heavy thread. Pour while hot into the well-beaten whites 
of two eggs, beating continuously. Beat until the mixture is 
nearly cold. Flavor and it is ready to use. 

This may be made into Nut Filling by adding at last a 
half pound of mixed chopped nuts. 

Into a Fruit Filling by adding a half pound of chopped 
candied fruits. 

It is wise to remember that with a rich filling it is best to use 
a plain cake. 

FRENCH FILLING 

This is used as a filling to layer sponge cake — two layers of 
cake and one of filling, the top dusted with powdered sugar. 

Beat the yolks of two eggs until creamy; add gradually a 
cup and a half of XXXX sugar. Beat well, add two table- 
spoonfuls of black coffee and a half cupful of almond or other 
nut paste or butter. 

MAPLE FILLING

just a moment, and add gradually, beating all the while, two 
cupfuls of XXXX sugar. Beat hard for ten minutes, and use 
at once. 

CREAM ICING 

Add two cupfuls of XXXX sugar to a half cupful of good 
cream. This must be sufficiently soft to pour. Add vanilla or 
caramel. 

WATER ICING 

Put two cupfuls of XXXX sugar into a bowl, add the grated 
yellow rind of an orange, two tablespoonfuls of orange juice 
and two tablespoonfuls of boiling water. Stir until sufficiently 
soft to spread nicely. Use at once. 

Lemon, vanilla or almond flavoring may be used. 

CHOCOLATE ICING 

Put four ounces of chocolate and half a cup of milk and ope cup 
of brown sugar over the fire. Boil and stir until the raixture 
will harden when dropped in cold water. Take from the fire 
and add a teaspoonful of vanilla. Use at once. 



CANDIES 



RULES TO BE REMEMBERED 

For molasses candy use New Orleans or Porto Rico molasses. 
Glucose syrups will not answer the same purpose. 

Recipes calling for chocolate mean unsweetened chocolate, 
unless otherwise stated. 



MINT TABLETS

Yi cup of water tar 

Put all the ingredients in a saucepan over the fire, and stir until 
the sugar is dissolved ; wipe down the pan, boil continuously 
until the mixture will form a soft ball when dropped into cold 
water. Take from the fire, add three drops of oil of peppermint, 
and stir rapidly until the mixture begins to have a grayish 
appearance; then pour at once and quickly into tiny greased 
patty pans. 

These mint tablets have a sugary appearance, and are as 
wholesome as candy can be. 

These patty pans can be purchased at any house-furnishing 
store. 

CHOCOLATE TABLETS

CREAM CARAMELS 

34 pound of chocolate Yz pint of cream 

I pint of granulated sugar 

Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, stir until boiling, and 
then constantly until the mixture forms a soft ball when dropped 
into cold water. Begin to test after the first ten minutes. Pour 
into a greased pan, and when cold, cut into inch squares. 



PEANUT KISSES 

Shell and remove the brown skins from a half pint of peanuts, 
and chop or roll them rather fine. Beat the whites of four eggs 
to a stifl: froth, but not dry; add carefully two cups of granu- 
lated sugar; stir in the nut mixture, and drop by teaspoonfuls 
on oiled paper ; bake in a moderate oven until a golden brown. 



FRENCH NOUGAT 

Shell and blanch a quarter pound of almonds ; put them into the 
oven until thoroughly dry, not brown. Brush a shallow baking 
pan lightly with oil ; sprinkle the bottom with almonds, and over 
this an equal quantity of pecan meats, and a few English wal- 
nuts ; the nuts should be -J. least half an inch thick. Put a pound 
of granulated sugar in a saucepan, and stir constantly over a 
strong fire until it melts. Pour this slowly all over the nuts. If 
there is not sufficient to cover them, melt a second lot, but pour 
it slowly and evenly so that the nuts will be thoroughly held 
together. When this is slightly cool, cut with a sharp knife into 
bars. 

Fruit Nougat is made exactly the same way, using fruit 
with the nuts. 

EVERTON TAFFY 

Put one cup of granulated sugar into a saucepan, and stir until

leaves quickly, one at a time, and put them on greased or oiled 
paper until crisp. 

This dipping must be done very carefully, and the mixture 
kept hot during the time. 

STUFFED DATES 

Make a cut down the thin side of the date, and carefully remove 
the stone without breaking the flesh ; put into the cavity either a 
quarter of an English walnut meat, a half pecan meat, or a half 
of a blanched and dried almond. Fold the nut over, giving it 
the appearance of a whole date. These may be served plain or 
rolled in granulated sugar. 

Peanuts may be used instead of the other nuts, using one 
whole peanut, two meats; or they may be stuffed with nut 
cheese. 

STUFFED FIGS 



I pound of pulled figs 



Yz pound of mixed nuts 



The nut mixture may consist of almonds, pecans, English wal- 
nuts and pinon nuts. Chip them very fine. Beat the white of 
one ^%% until partly light ; then add six tablespoon fuls of pow- 
dered sugar, and beat until stiff. Stir the nuts into this paste, 
add a half of the grated yellow rind of an orange or a little 
vanilla; mix thoroughly. Split the figs on one side carefully, 
scoop out a portion of the inside flesh ; mix it with the nuts ; 
then stuff the figs until they are quite distended, putting the skin 
together so that the split may not be seen. Arrange on a paper 
mat in a pretty glass dish, and serve as dessert.

of tartar, and boil until it is very brittle when dropped into cold 
water. Watch carefully and stir occasionally to prevent scorch- 
ing. Now add butter and soda. Pour on a greased marble 
slab or into a pan, and when sufficiently cool to handle, pull until 
light in color. Cut in desired shapes. 

This may be rolled into a long, thin strip, the centre of the 
strip filled with cream candy or nut cheese, two strips rolled 
together, and cut with a sharp knife or scissors into Butter 
Cups. 

ICE CREAM TAFFY 

I pound of sugar i tablespoonful of vinegar 

Yz cup of water 

Put the ingredients over the fire until they are dissolved ; wipe 
down the sides of the pan and boil to the ''crack." Turn the 
mixture into an oiled pan or on a marble slab, and when cool 
enough to handle, pull until white and glossy. Add vanilla or 
wintergreen now and then during the pulling. 

To make Chocolate Ice Cream Taffy, add two ounces of 
chocolate just as you begin to pull ; that is, put the chocolate 
right in the centre of the candv, fold over the edges and then 
pull. 

CHOCOLATE CHIPS 

I pound of sugar i saltspoonful of cream of tar- 

I cup of water tar 

Put the ingredients over the fire until the sugar is dissolved, 
wipe down the pan, and boil without stirring until the syrup is 
brittle when dropped into cold water. This must have boiled 
until it reaches the ''crack." Take from the fire, add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, and turn out in a pan or on a marble slab ; 
when cool fold in the edges, and, with a china or wooden roller, 
roll quickly until the whole is as flat as a wafer. Cut into strips 
two inches long and one inch wide. Dip into melted chocolate 
or chocolate fondant. 



BEVERAGES 

Under this heading, we should place water only, as it alone 
fulfills the place of a true beverage. The body is seventy-five 
per cent, water, and this amount must be rigidly kept up to pro- 
duce a healthy condition. In the very young and aged, the 
amount is slightly increased. It is quite common to hear 
elderly persons remark that they are cold; their blood is thin. 
This is true in a way, as there is usually more water in propor- 
tion even when the body is lighter in weight. 

Tea and coffee are not beverages when saturated with sugar 
and cream or milk. They must be taken as food and ranked as 
such. Chocolate is called a beverage, probably because it is 
served in a cup and taken with food. This, however, is a great 
mistake. A cup of well-made chocolate or cocoa contains suf- 
ficient food for the ordinary breakfast. Children who are com- 
pelled to eat a large plate of oatmeal and with it a cup of choco- 
late, find it difficult to do their morning's school work without 
headache. Such children break down easily, and become 
nervous. Tea, coffee and chocolate each contain an alkaloid, 
which is more or less stimulating, and chocolate is quite as bad 
as tea and coffee. The caifein of coffee, the thein of tea and 
the theobromin of chocolate are all stimulants. Coming now to 
our markets, we have Paraguay tea, Yerba Mate, the leaves 
and twigs of the Paraguay Ilex, a tree belonging to the holly 
family. Mate contains an alkaloid identical with thein. Of 
the two, however. Mate seems to be the more stimulating. 
With the exception of chocolate or cocoa, both containing starch, 
all beverages should be infused very lightly. Coffee, so 
rigidly condemned by the average physician, is far less objec-. 
tionable when carefully made. The serious and unpleasant 
results come from the use of heavy decoctions, made by boil- 
ing. We have in the market some thirty or forty admirably

constructed coffee pots for the making of infusions. In select- 
ing a pot choose one with a top or second story, in which the 
grounds are held, above the water. All pots are to be con- 
demned where the grounds are dropped or held in the infusion. 
Cloth or haircloth bags may be used successfully, provided 
the bags are always washed in cold water and quickly dried. 
Such an arrangement is to be condemned, unless the cook or 
housewife is particular about the care. 

Coffee, of all materials, must be made carefully. Like but- 
ter and milk, it seems to take the flavor of other materials with 
which it comes in contact. The bag will taste of soap, and if 
it is once scalded in soap suds, it is practically useless again 
for coffee making. If possible, clean new cheese cloth should 
be scalded, ironed and put aside, and a new bag made each 
week. The reversible French pots and those with glass tops 
are always to be recommended. They are serviceable, easily 
managed, and having alcohol lamp attachments, are admissible 
on the table, where the coffee can be carefully made from fresh 
water and in proper proportions. 



PERFECT COFFEE 

A perfect infusion is made from coffee browned to a golden 
yellow and finely ground (not pulverized). Allow three round- 
ing tablespoonfuls to each pint of water. For large quantities, 
eight ounces to one gallon of water. Scald the pot, put the 
coffee in the upper part or percolator, pour over water that has 
just reached boiling point ; draw the water from the under part 
of the pot, and pour it again over the coffee. Do this three 
times. Light the alcohol lamp underneath, and as soon as the 
coffee reaches the boiling point, use at once. If coffee is per- 
colated in the kitchen, the pot should be placed in a pan of 
hot water, the grounds removed, or the bag taken from the 
top before it is sent to the dining-room. Where large quanti- 
ties of coffee are to be made and kept heated for a space of 
one or two hours, the bag must be removed after the last perco- 
lation, and the coffee kept at boiling point. Coffee cannot be 



636 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

chilled and then re-heated. The flavor and the consistency of 
the coffee are spoiled. Coffee can be kept hot for hours, pro- 
vided the grounds are removed. 

BOILED COFFEE 

This really should not be boiled. Allow the same amount of 
coffee as in the preceding recipe. To each three tablespoonfuls 
allow a third of the white of an egg beaten with one cup of cold 
water. Mix this with the coffee, and let it stand for ten or fif- 
teen minutes. Then pour over a half pint of boiling water. 
Bring to boiling point, add a little cold water ; when it reaches 
boiling point again, add two or three more tablespoonfuls of 
cold water, let it come the third time to the boiling point and 
take it from the fire. In about two minutes, strain the coffee 
in a hot china pot, and send at once to the table. 

BRE.. ^AST COFFEE 

The above recipes wiL wci for the coffee. Breakfast coffee 
is better served with hot milk. Coffee with cream is palatable, 
but is apt to prod ^^u^ "^ach. Take your breakfast coffee 
infused, and dilm with ^^c^lding milk, or clear with sugar. 
Do not add both sugar and milk or cream, thaii-is, if you wish 
to drink coffee any length of time. Put the->/ "in a double 
boiler. Watch it carefully until the watc^' -t'^ 'nding it 
comes to a boil ; lift the milk quickly and poQ- > <^ .i heated 
pitcher, cover and send it to the table. In pourmg, fill the cup 
half full of hot milk, and pour in the coffee. 

Caution. — The milk must not boil. Cream must not be 
heated. If cream is served, it must be used cold. 

TEA 

Scald the pot. Remove the water, and put in a level teaspoon- 
ful of good tea to each pint of water. Take the water at its 
first boil. Cover the pot with a cozy, and stand it away from 
the fire for five minutes. Stir the tea and pour at once. The 
ordinary English tea cozy, a sort of padded cap, is clumsy, and

takes considerable space on the table. Then, too, it quickly 
becomes soiled and is objectionable. The Chinese tea basket 
is always to be recommended. 

Caution. — Tea must not be made over the fire ; nor must it 
be made in a metal pot. The tannic acid acts on the metal, 
destroys the flavor of the tea, and makes the infusion unwhole- 
some. 

MATE (Verl^a Maii) 

Each package of Mate contains at the top a small muslin bag. 
This bag will last in good condition for the given quantity of 
Mate. 

Allow a level teaspoonful to one pint of carefully boiled 
water. Put the Mate in the bag, pour through the water, 
remove the bag at once, and the infusion is ready to serve. 

CHOCOLATE 

Chocolate and cocoa contain starc^^^^^A must be boiled.

make one quart, put two ounces of chocolafe in a double boiler, 
and add one pint of hot wat*- ^ti^, i^ijl the chocolate is

ring all the while, until the mixture reaches boiling point. Boil 
just a moment. Add one and a half pints of milk and three 
rounding tablespoonfuls of sugar, and stir constantly until the 
milk is very hot. Be very careful not to boil. Take from the 
fire, turn into a heated chocolate pot and serve with whipped 
cream. Both chocolate and cocoa may be flavored with vanilla 
if desired.

JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING 



Before attempting to make jelly, one should become perfectly 
familiar with the character and the peculiarities of sugar. The 
numerous varieties of sugar may be roughly divided into three 
groups. 

Saccharoses Glucoses Amylosbs 



C12H22011 


CeHisOo CcHioOs 


Sucrose (cane sugar) 


Dextrose Starch 


Maltose (malt sugar) 


Grape sugar Gum 


Lactose (milk sugar) 


Levulose (fruit sugar) Dextrin 




Inulin 




Cellulose 



We are principally concerned, In the household, with cane sugar. 
I do not believe the ordinary glucose is wholesome for con- 
tinued use. We know so little about its action that it is far 
better to let it alone for the time being. Under the head of 
true sugar or saccharoses, we find also maple and beet sugar. 
In the same group are several different sugars, and while they 
are represented by the same symbols, they are not equally 
influenced by the digestive ferments. For instance, yeast acts 
quickly on a thin solution of cane sugar, converting it first into 
alcohol and then into acetic acid. * 

In this same group we have lactose (milk sugar), upon 
which yeast has apparently little or no effect. For this reason, 
in making koumys (a fermented milk food) a small amount 
of cane sugar must be added to produce the desired results. 

Maltose is formed by the action of the enzyme ptyalin in 
the saliva, and the enzyme amylopsin in the pancreatic secre- 
tions, on the starches during the process of digestion. Cane 
sugar may be changed into dextrose during digestion — glu- 
cose is a dextrose — but let us do this laboratory work by nat- 
ural process. The glucose of commerce, an impure dextrose, 
is very liable to unnatural fermentations in the stomach and 

640 



JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING 641 

intestines. Granting it to be a pure product, it is a result of the 
digestion outside of the body. As such it is still objectionable. 
We do not need, when in a normal, healthful condition, predi- 
gested foods. 

Glucose is made by boiling cornstarch with dilute sulphuric 
acid. It is then neutralized with lime, drawn off, and after 
settling into a clear, thin syrup, is evaporated to the desired 
thickness and sold under the name of glucose. It frequently 
comes to our table as ''drips" or "table syrup." In the solid, 
sugar-like form, it is sold under the name of grape sugar. It 
is far less sweet than cane sugar, and is more expensive at 
half the price. 

If an acid fruit or a fruit juice is boiled with cane sugar, 
the sugar, in the presence of heat and moisture, and under the 
influence of the acid, is split into two sugars, one-half of which 
is dextrose, the other half levulose, invert sugars. The latter 
sugar is usually in a syrup form, and dextrose is difficult of 
crystallization. Levulose is deadly sweet, and this is why pre- 
serves are so much sweeter than fruits with the same amount 
of sugar sprinkled over them. Thin, syrup-like jelly has 
been boiled too long; the sugar has "split," and you have a 
syrup rather than a jelly. The more acid a fruit contains, the 
more difficult to make a jelly. 

In jelly making, if the fruit is overripe, and a pound of 
sugar is added to a pint of juice, crystals are formed, from the 
excess of sugar, throughout the cooling jelly. This is especially 
true of grapes. We do not depend upon the acid of the fruit 
for jelly making, but the amount of pectose the fruit contains. 
It is with the greatest difficulty that a jelly can be made from 
rhubarb. Cranberries, if boiled, break down in a sauce. If 
they are simply mixed with the sugar quickly, the jelly will be 
sufficiently hard to cut into slices. Over-ripe fruits are not 
easily made into jelly. Pectose, an insoluble body existing in 
many fruits, especially if they are a little under-ripe, will, by 
the natural ferments of the fruits, be converted into pectin. 
Pectin does not readily unite with sugar to form a jelly. Pec- 
tose does. This is found ready made in the ordinary Irish moss. 

Do not confound pectose with vegetable mucilage, an 

41 



642 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

entirely different substance, which exists in quince, flaxseed, 
elm bark and marshmallows, and forms a thick, ropy syrup. 
Such materials retard true jelly making. Quince seeds will 
thicken the syrup, but the jelly will not have a true, clean, jelly- 
like condition ; it will be sticky, or ropy. 

Crab-apples, guavas, grapes, just ripe, lady blush apples, 
yellow pippins, under-ripe blackberries and quinces contain 
the largest amount of pectose, and will yield a firm, stiff jelly 
with half a pound of sugar added to each pint of fruit juice. 
The juice must be boiling when the sugar is added. Large 
fruits, as quinces, apples and crab-apples, need not be pared, 
but the seeds must be removed. 



JELLY MAKING 

Jelly making may be divided into two classes: That from 
fruit rich in pectose, and the by far larger class, containing but 
a little pectose, and a goodly quantity of acid. 

THE FIRST GROUP 

In the first group we will place guavas, crab-apples, quinces, 
Japanese quinces, lady blush apples, pippins and black cur- 
rants. It is not necessary to pare the fruit. Remove the seeds 
and cores, cut the fruit into thin strips, put in a porcelain-lined 
kettle, and cover with cold water. Allow to each pound of 
fruit one quart of water. Cover the kettle, boil twenty minutes 
and drain the pulp over night. Next morning measure the 
liquor. To each pint allow a half pound of sugar. Put the 
sugar in a pan and stand it in a moderate oven. Put the liquor 
in a porcelain-lined kettle and bring to boiling point, boil 
ten minutes, add the sugar, and try the jelly at once. Nine out 
of ten times, if the fruit has been in good condition it will jelly 
instantly. 

Put a teaspoonful into a saucer and stand it on ice; if it 
solidifies at once remove the jelly from the fire, and pour it 
carefully into perfectly clean tumblers. 



JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING 



643 



I 



If possible, put the jelly to cool under glass or window sash, 
so that the air will not fall directly on it; the sash should be 
fixed so that it will not touch the top of the glasses. The 
spores of mold constantly floating in the air, are apt to fall on 
the jelly while it is cooling. Then jelly molds as soon as it 
is put into a dark closet. When the jelly is cold and firm, cover 
the tops with two thicknesses of tissue paper, pasting it down on 
the tumblers with either photographers' paste or white of egg. 
When dry, brush the tops of the paper lightly with a mixture 
of a teaspoonful of formaldehyde and a half pint of water, and 
let them dry again. This wetting and drying will shrink the 
paper, making the top almost like a bladder skin. Keep the 
jelly in a perfectly clean closet; allow the sun to enter the closet 
every day. Fruits and jellies are better kept in sunlight than 
in the dark. Dark and damp closets are conducive to mold. 



THE SECOND GROUP 

This group will include grapes and ripe blackberries, raspber- 
ries, currants and strawberries. While these fruits contain 
pectose, they also contain fruit sugar and a goodly quantity of 
acid. To make jelly easily from these fruits, select those just 
a little under-ripe and perfectly fresh from vine or bush. Soft 
fruits, as currants, raspberries and strawberries, are mashed 
and drained over night. Boil and finish precisely the same as 
in preceding recipe, using one pound of sugar to each pint of 
juice. 

Grapes must be covered with water, allowing one pint to 
a pound, boiled, drained over night and finished as in first 
recipe, allowing two-thirds of a pound of sugar to each pint 
of juice. 

Plums are rich in pectose, which is more or less over- 
powered by the quantity of acid they contain. Water must be 
used sparingly. Use a pound of sugar to each pint of juice. 

Cherries, peaches, pears, huckleberries and elderberries con- 
tain so little pectose that it is almost impossible to make from 
them a good stiff jelly. 



644 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

APPLE JELLY 

12 pounds of apples 6 quarts of water 

Sugar 

Wash, wipe and cut the apples into halves, then into quarters, 
and remove the cores. Slice them rather thin, put them into 
a porcelain-lined kettle, add the cold water, cover the kettle, 
bring to boiling point, and boil gently for twenty minutes. 
Drain carefully over night; do not squeeze or press the bag. 
Next morning measure this syrup, put it into a porcelain-lined 
kettle, bring quickly to boiling point, boil rapidly for five min- 
utes, and add one pound of sugar to each pint of juice; stir 
until the sugar is dissolved. Boil quickly and begin to "try;" 
just as soon as it begins to form a jelly take it from the fire 
and fill it at once into perfectly clean tumblers. To "try," dip 
a teaspoonful into a saucer and stand the saucer into cold water, 
or on a piece of ice. In a moment scrape the spoon through 
it, and if it is brittle, like jelly, it has been boiled long enough. 
Add the seeds of two vanilla beans, and pour at once into tum- 
blers. There is more danger in over-boiling than under-boiling. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY 

Stem, wash and mash the berries, drain in a jelly bag or 
through a piece of cheese cloth. To each pint allow one pound 
of sugar. Put the juice over the fire, bring to boiling point, 
and boil for fifteen minutes ; add the sugar, stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, boil for five minutes, and begin to try. Put a little 
in a saucer, and stand it on the ice ; if it forms a jelly-like crust 
on the surface, fill into tumblers, cool and fasten as directed. 

This recipe will answer for Raspberries, Raspberries and 
Currants Mixed, and Currants. 



PRESERVING 

This word is used, in reference to fruits, when they are cooked 
in a thick syrup. Sugar is not a preservative, unless the syrup 
is sufficiently dense to prevent the entrance of bacteria. The 



JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING 645 

Spores of mold will fall on the surface, grow and spoil the true 
flavor of the fruit ; but they rarely cause fermentation. 

One recipe will answer for preserving all kinds of fruits. 

Prepare the fruit, weigh, and to each pound allow one 
pound of sugar. The more solid fruits, as pears, apples and 
quinces, must be boiled in clear water until tender before add- 
ing the sugar. The water in which they are boiled may be 
saved for jelly making or flavoring. In preserving quinces, it 
is the universal rule to make jelly from this water and the 
skins, using the flesh of the quince for preserves or conserves. 
After the fruit is tender, add it to the boiUng syrup, that has 
been made from the sugar and sufficient water to melt it. Cook 
slowly, below the boiling point, until the fruit is transparent. 
Put in tumblers or jars, seal or cover with paraffin or paper 
the same as jelly. 



STRAWBERRIES PRESERVED IN THE SUN 

While the sun-preserved fruits require time and patience, they 
are, without doubt, much better than those cooked over the 
fire. In the country, where a hot-bed is at command, the work 
is easily done. Put the strawberries into a wire basket, 
which plunge down in a pan of cold water, drain thoroughly, 
stem carefully without bruising. Weigh the strawberries, and 
to each pound allow one pound of granulated sugar. Select 
large stoneware plates, make them very hot either on top of the 
stove or in the oven ; sprinkle over a layer of the granulated 
sugar and cover this closely with the berries. Cover with glass 
and stand in the sun's hottest rays. Move the dish as the sun 
changes its position. At four o'clock bring them in, and stand 
aside in a closet or cool place. Next day put them out again 
in the sun. By this time they will no doubt have become clear, 
almost transparent, and thoroughly soft, but perfectly whole. 
Lift each berry carefully with a fork, and put into a tumbler 
or bottle. Boil the syrup over the fire for a few minutes until 
it thickens ; strain, cool, and pour it over the fruit. 
This recipe will answer also for Raspberries. 



646 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES, No. 2 

To preserve strawberries in the old-fashioned way, wash and 
hull the berries as directed above, and use the same proportion 
of sugar. Cover the bottom of a large porcelain kettle with 
the sugar; put in the berries, then sprinkle over more sugar; 
stand over a very moderate fire until the strawberries reach the 
scalding point; lift them carefully into jars, boil down the 
syrup, cover, and when cold, seal. 

APPLE BUTTER 

Reduce the cider one-half by boiling. When it is time to make 
the apple butter, pare, core and quarter the desired quantity of 
apples, allowing one-third of sweet to two-thirds of sour apples. 
Have the cider boiling rapidly, throw in the apples and keep 
constantly stirring until they are cooked and reduced. Then 
throw in more, and so on until you have the mixture the desired 
thickness. Cook slowly, skimming whenever necessary, and stir- 
ring constantly. When it begins to break, that is, when the 
apples separate from the cider, add to each bushel of apples two 
pounds of sugar and a little cinnamon, and continue the cook- 
ing until, by trying a small quantity in a saucer, it is found to 
be a smooth mass, and does not separate. It requires, as a rule, 
a half bushel of sweet and one bushel of sour apples to each 
gallon and a half of boiled cider. 

PEACH BUTTER 

Wipe the peaches, do not pare, remove the stones. Put them 
in a porcelain kettle, add to each peck a quart of water, cover 
the kettle and cook slowly one hour, stirring frequently; add 
five pounds of sugar, cook, and stir constantly for another half 
hour. This should be smooth and the consistency of mush. 

CONSERVES 

Conserves or candied fruits are simply preserved fruits, dried. 
One recipe will answer for all fruits. 



JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING 647 

Prepare and weigh the fruit, and to each pound allow one 
pound of sugar. Quinces are usually cut into very thin slices ; 
pineapples cut into slices or blocks; cherries stoned; oranges 
left perfectly whole; citrons cut into halves and the pulp and 
seeds scooped out ; lemon rind and orange rind the same. The 
rinds of the latter three are used as flavoring for cakes, mince 
meat and puddings. 

For Cherries, Pineapple, Quinces, Gages and Pears, 
put the sugar into a preserving kettle, and to each pound allow 
one pint of water and a saltspoonful of cream of tartar; stir 
over the fire until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, boil and 
skim. Put in the fruit. Cover the kettle, and push to the back 
of the stove, where it will simmer gently until the fruit is per- 
fectly transparent ; drain in sieves, dust thickly with sugar and 
dry either in the sun or in a moderate oven. When the fruit 
has lost its moisture on the outside, roll it in granulated sugar. 
To keep, arrange it in layers between sheets of wax paper. 

For Orange, Lemon and Citron, cover the prepared rinds 
with brine, and stand them aside over night. Next morning, 
drain, cover with fresh cold water, bring to a boil, drain, cover 
again with fresh cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer gently 
until the skins are tender'; drain, and weigh; allow one pound 
of sugar to each pound of rinds. Proceed as directed above. 



CANNING 

All fruits may be canned with or without sugar, as a thin syrup 
takes no part whatever in the preservation of the fruits. 
Canned fruits must be sterile, and this is best and most easily 
accomplished by heat. 

All preservatives are more or less dangerous. If these 
materials will prevent fermentation in jars, and "preserve" the 
fruits, they will also "preserve" it in the stomach. Of what 
use are indigestible foods? 

Canning is easily done if the housewife can be made to 
understand surgical cleanliness. 

One recipe will answer for all small fruits. 



648 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

TO CAN SMALL FRUITS WITHOUT SUGAR 

Pick over, and wash the fruits if they are sandy. Pack them in 
perfectly clean jars; adjust the rubbers; fill the jars with cold 
water, lay on the lids, do not screw or fasten them down. Stand 
the jars in a boiler, the bottom of which has been protected 
with a rack, surround the jars half way up with cold water, 
cover the boiler, bring to boiling point, and boil rapidly five 
minutes. Uncover the boiler, lift one jar at a time, and fasten 
each lid, without removing it from the jar. 

Caution. — Do not lift off the lids and lay them on the 
table. The table has on it spores of molds or yeasts, which will 
grow inside the jars and cause fermentation. 

TO CAN WITH SUGAR 

Make a syrup, boil it, and when cold use the same as plain 
water. Allow a pound of sugar to each pint of water ; or for the 
soft fruits, as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, sprinkle 
them with sugar before putting them in the jars. If in cooking 
they melt and shrink, at the end of the boiling fill two jars from 
a third. Cover and cook ten minutes. 

TO CAN LARGE FRUIT WITH SUGAR 

This recipe will answer equally well for peaches and plums. 
Put them in a wire basket or colander, and plunge them 
down into boiling water. Peel off the skins, remove the stones 
or not, as you wish, weigh the fruit, and allow to each pound 
of fruit a quarter pound of sugar. Put the sugar in a kettle, 
and to each pound add a quart of water. Boil, skim and cool. 
Put the fruit in the jars and pour over the syrup; adjust the 
rubbers, lay on the lids, and finish the same as small fruits. 

TO CAN PEACHES WITHOUT SUGAR 

Follow the preceding recipe, using plain boiled and cooled 
water.

JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING 649 

TO CAN PEARS 

Pare, cut the fruit into halves, remove the cores, and put 
them at once into cold water to prevent discoloration. When 
you have eleven good-sized pears ready, put them in a porce- 
lain kettle; cover with hot water, and cook slowly until they 
can be easily pierced with a straw. Lift each piece carefully, 
arrange them in a jar, cover with boiled, cold water, adjust 
the rubbers, put them in a boiler and follow directions in first 
recipe. Boil ten minutes after they begin to boil. Syrup may 
be used for canning the same as with peaches. 

GAGES AND PLUMS 

Scald the gages and remove the skins and weigh. To each 
pound allow a half pound of sugar. Pack the gages neatly in 
pint jars and adjust the rubbers. Add to each pound of sugar 
a half pint of water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, and pour 
the syrup into the jars. Lay the caps of the jars on loosely ; do 
not fasten them. Arrange them in the boiler the same as for 
peaches, and boil for thirty minutes after they begin to boil. 
Lift one jar ^t q. time and fasten the lid without removing it. 

TO CAN CHERRIES 

Stone and weigh the cherries. Allow to each pound a half 
pound of sugar; sprinkle this in layers between the cherries, 
and stand them aside for a half hour. Heat to boiling point 
enough to fill three or four jars, skim, and stir lightly until 
they boil again. Scald the jars, adjust the rubbers, and scald 
the tops, stand a jar on a folded towel on a pie tin, carry it to 
the stove, and, holding it near the preserving kettle, fill it with 
the boiling cherries; quickly fasten on the top. So continue, 
filling and sealing one jar before filling a second. 

Strawberries, Raspberries, Blackberries and Huckle- 
berries may be canned by this same method. All these fruits 
may be canned without sugar, and cooked the same as plums. 



650 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

STRAWBERRY JUICE 

Wash and hull the berries; mash, strain them first through a 
fine sieve, then a jelly-bag. Put the syrup in a porcelain-lined 
kettle, boil rapidly ten minutes ; bottle while hot, cork and seal. 

Strawberry Syrup is prepared in the same way. After the 
syrup has boiled for ten minutes, add sugar in the proportion 
of a half pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Put into bottles, 
and seal while hot. 

Other Fruit Juices and Syrups are bottled in precisely 
the same manner. 



CANNING VEGETABLES 

Where the housewife understands the real definition of surgical 
cleanliness, the canning of vegetables becomes an easy process. 

All vegetables are easily kept if the conditions are correct. 
Containing sugar and starch, as many vegetables do, they fur- 
nish food for the yeast plants and bacteria, which makes them 
more difficult to keep than fruits rich in acids. Tomatoes are 
most easily kept ; in fact, it is with difficulty that one can spoil 
them, but they are the exception. Corn, beets and peas, con- 
taining sugar, are the most difficult vegetables to preserve. 

The jars must have glass or metal tops without lining. A 
porcelain lining leaves a space between it and the upper lid, 
which cannot be easily cleaned. All vegetables must be freshly 
gathered and carefully prepared. Not a single law or rule can 
be modified or overlooked. 



TO CAN ASPARAGUS 

Wash and trim the asparagus. Cover it with boiling water, 
boil fifteen minutes, drain, cool, and arrange it neatly, heads up, 
in wide-mouthed jars; adjust the rubbers, fill the jars to over- 
flowing, with water that has been boiled and cooled; add a half 
teaspoonful of salt, and lay the tops on loosely. Stand the jars 
in a large wash-boiler, the bottom of which has been protected 



JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING 651 

by a rack; surround them half way up with cold water, cover 
the boiler, bring quickly to boiling point, and boil continuously 
for one and a half hours. Lift one jar at a time, and quickly 
fasten on and screw down the lid without lifting it from the jar. 
This recipe will also answer for String Beans; the beans 
may be cut crosswise or into three pieces lengthwise. 

TO CAN PEAS 

Fill clean jars with freshly picked young peas; fill each jar 
with water that has been boiled and cooled; adjust the rub- 
bers, lay on loosely the tops, arrange them in a wash boiler as 
directed in preceding recipe, and boil them continuously for two 
and a half to three hours. Lift each jar and fasten it without 
lifting the lid of the jar; that is, you must not lift the lid off 
and put it down, then pick it up and put it on the jar. It will 
hold sufficient yeast spores to contaminate the jar. 

This rule will also answer for young Lima Beans and other 
shell beans. 

TO CAN CORN 

Score down each row of grains and press out the pulp; pack 
this pulp into pint jars, adjust the rubbers, lay on the lids 
loosely; stand the jars in a wash boiler, the bottom of which 
is protected by a rack, surround them partly with cold water, 
cover the boiler, and boil continuously for three and a half 
hours. Then fasten each jar, put it back into the boiler, cover 
the boiler, and boil thirty minutes longer. Never mind whether 
the jars are full or not ; that is of little importance compared 
to the cleanly condition of the jars. If it becomes necessary to 
fill two jars from a third on account of the shrinking of the 
materials, do it quickly, screw down the lids, and cook thirty 
minutes longer. 

TO CAN BEETS 

Select young fresh beets; wash, put them into boiling water, 
and boil carefully for thirty minutes; then remove the skins, 
and pack the beets into quart jars. Add a half pint of vinegar 



662 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

to a quart of water that has been boiled and cooled ; fill the jars 
with this mixture, adjust the rubbers, and lay the tops on 
loosely. Put the jars in a wash boiler, and arrange them 
according to preceding recipes. Cover the boiler, and boil con- 
tinuously for three-quarters of an hour. Fasten the jars, and 
stand them away. 

Carrots and Turnips may be canned after this rule, omit- 
ting the vinegar, and using plain water that has been boiled 
and cooled. 

TO CAN TOMATOES WHOLE 

Select medium-sized solid tomatoes, put them into a wire basket 
or colander, plunge them down into boiling water for just a 
moment, and remove ; peel off the skins, arrange them in one- 
quart or two-quart jars, adjust the rubbers, add a lialf tea- 
spoonful of salt to each jar, and fill with cold water that has 
been boiled and cooled. Lay the tops on loosely, arrange them 
in a wash boiler as directed, cover the boiler, bring to boiling 
point, and boil ten minutes. Fasten each jar without lifting 
the lid. 

STEWED TOMATOES 

Peel the tomatoes as directed in preceding recipe, cut them into 
halves, and press out the seeds ; put the flesh of the tomatoes 
into a porcelain-lined kettle; boil, stirring frequently until the 
tomatoes are reduced to the proper consistency, which will take 
about thirty minutes. In the meantime, put the rubbers into 
boiling water. Put the jars and lids into cold water, and bring 
to boiling point. When you are ready to can the tomatoes lift 
one jar from the hot water, stand it on a folded cloth in a pie 
dish at the side of the stove ; adjust the rubber, put into the jar 
a broad-mouthed funnel that has also been taken from boiling 
water, and, with a dipper, fill the jar to overflowing with the 
boiling tomatoes. Take a lid from the boiling water, and put 
it at once on the jar, fasten it, and so continue until you have 
canned the amount. Fill only one jar at a time, and fasten that 
jar before filling a second. 

Corn and Okra may be cooked with the tomatoes, and 
canned after this rule. 



TABLE WAITING— OR HOW TO 
TRAIN THE WAITRESS 

A COURSE DINNER 

Perhaps it is unnecessary to say that a long course dinner must 
never be undertaken by those who keep only one or two ser- 
vants. To have the conventional dinner a success, dishes must 
be well-cooked, delicately seasoned, handsomely garnished and 
properly served. Hot dishes must come to the table smoking 
hot and be served on hot plates. Cold dishes must be cold 
and served on cold plates. White dishes must be white, and 
brown dishes that chestnut brown color, given only by artistic 
cooking. Where only one servant is kept, a small, three-course 
dinner is much more satisfactory ; in fact, a crust of bread and 
a cup of tea daintily and handsomely served is much more hos- 
pitable than an elaborate dinner badly served in an ill-heated 
and ill-lighted room. Even the conventional dinner served by 
well trained servants should have the number of its guests lim- 
ited ; it is far better to give three dinners to six guests than 
one to eighteen. The success of a dinner, large or small, 
depends upon the selection of the guests. Brilliant conversa- 
tion is really the dinner. The host and hostess should be as 
free from the thought of the routine of a dinner as any guest 
at the table, otherwise the dinner is a failure. At a formal din- 
ner, conventional etiquette must be strictly observed. Rules 
have been formulated that cannot be neglected or overlooked ; 
the form of invitation, the manner of seating the guests, and 
even the garnishing and serving of the dishes must conform to 
these accepted rules. In large establishments, where every 
dinner is well served, there is no change in the general routine. 
One may add an entree or a game course without changing the 
general plan of the daily meal. The ordinary home dinner, in 
nine out of ten families, consists of soup followed bv meat 

063 



654 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

with two vegetables, then a salad course with wafers and 
cheese, the dessert and coffee. You may call this if you like, 
five courses. Coffee is frequently brought in with the dessert. 
To elongate this dinner, to make it rather more pretentious, add 
a fish course, or serve game with the salad. Such a dinner 
would be sufficiently elegant, no matter to whom served. 



THE COMPANY DINNER 

The hostess should hand her bill of fare to the cook at least 
four days before the dinner party. All instructions should be 
carefully written. If she has a waitress of whom she is not 
sure, let the instructions for her also be carefully written. If a 
butler is employed he will know how to serve, but must be 
acquainted with that especial bill of fare in order to select the 
proper china. 

An eight-course dinner, simply, quickly and elegantly 
served, will require about one and a half to two hours ; every 
moment over this is a discomfort. In arranging the bill of 
fare, be most cautious in the choice of dishes. Select those in 
season, foods that are actually fresh, as well as those harmoniz- 
ing with the occasion and surroundings. If fish, an entree, a 
meat course and game are served, make sure that the dessert 
is light, sightly and appetizing. Syllabub garnished with 
chopped cherries, an omelette soufflee, or a handsome Charlotte 
Russe are to be preferred. The dining-room must be well- 
lighted, well-heated and carefully ventilated. 

Invitations will be sent out two weeks in advance, and must 
be answered at once ; otherwise the hostess is unable to fill the 
vacant seats, and this spoils the arrangement of the table. 
Accepted dinner invitations must be rigidly complied with; 
under no circumstances must a trivial affair prevent the going. 
If there is any doubt in your mind when accepting, better regret 
and miss the dinner party than to be discourteous and embar- 
rass the hostess. A dinner invitation may be accepted or 
regretted formally. A little informal note, however, when the 
invitation cannot be accepted, is much more pleasing to the 



TABLE WAITING 



655 



hostess. Well-bred people do not use R. S. V. P. on dinner 
invitations. Your guests will have sufficient politeness to reply 
without having their attention abruptly called to it. The gen- 
eral form of invitation will read : 



Mr. and Mrs. William Jones Wilson 

request the honor of 

Colonel and Mrs. Charles A. Brown's companjf 

at dinner 

on Tuesday, January fourth 

at eight o'clock 

1826 Walnut Street 

December first, nineteen hundred and two 



Direct the envelope 
acceptance will read : 



to Mrs. Charles A. Brown. The 



Colonel and Mrs. Charles A. Brown 

accept with pleasure 

Mr. and Mrs. William Jones Wilson's 

invitation to dinner on 

Tuesday, January fourth 

at eight o'clock 

1520 West Superior Street 

December first, nineteen hundred and two 



656 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

The envelope should be addressed to Mrs. William Jones 
Wilson. A formal regret will read: 



1 



Colonel and Mrs. Charles A. Brown 

regret that a previous engagement 

prevents the acceptance of 

Mr. and Mrs. William Jones Wilson's 

kind invitation to dinner on 

Tuesday, January fourth 

at eight o'clock 

1520 West Superior Street 

December first, nineteen hundred and two 



To my way of thinking, a little informal note, explainmg 
the true cause of regret, is much more satisfying. 

To an ordinary home dinner, or where one invites just a few 
friends to a simple dinner, write a little note saying : 



My Dear Mrs. Brown 

Will you and Colonel Brown dine with 
us, informally, on Monday evening, January sixteenth, 
at seven o'clock? I am 

Sincerely yours 

Bertha May Easton 
1806 Walnut Street 

December first, nineteen hundred and two 



Do not for a moment think that your informal dinner must 
be a hap-hazard one ; have everything as well served as though

TABLE WAITING 657 

it were a formal dinner. If you have a butler, he wears for all 
dinners a dress suit and white tie. If a waitress a plain black 
dress with broad collar, white cuffs and waitress' apron with 
bib, and three-pointed waitress' cap. This cap may be per- 
fectly plain white, or have in front a small, black velvet bow. 

Above all things, see that the dinner is ready just at the 
appointed time, not ten minutes before nor ten minutes after 
the hour. Be prompt. Nothing is more discouraging to a good 
cook than a dinner spoiled by over-waiting. A few minutes' 
grace is allowed to professional men, as physicians. If your 
company consists of guests of this kind, have the cook allow 
a grace of ten to fifteen minutes over the appointed hour. 

At large conventional dinners, there is usually placed in the 
gentlemen's dressing room, a small tray holding envelopes 
addressed to the gentlemen, containing cards, on which is writ- 
ten the lady's name whom each is to escort to the table. If the 
dinner is large and the table long, it is wise to note also the side 
of the table to which he is assigned ; for instance, if he is to be 
seated on the right side of the table, a large R or the word right, 
if the left, the word left. If a strange lady should be assigned 
to him, that is a lady to whom he has not been presented, he 
must make this known to the servant, the servant to the hostess, 
who will at once "present" him. The waitress or butler keeps 
a sharp watch out for the arrival of guests. When all have 
arrived and have had sufficient time in the dressing room, din- 
ner will be announced. The servant will enter just at the parlor 
door, wait until the hostess recognizes him, and then say 
quietly, "dinner is served," and, with a bow to the hostess, 
back out of the room. The host immediately offers his right 
arm to the rnost distinguished lady guest, who sits at his right 
at the table. They lead the way to the dining-room, the 
remaining guests following, the hostess, with the most dis- 
tinguished gentleman, waiting until the last. All remain stand- 
ing at their places at the table, until the hostess arrives. She 
will be seated immediately, and all will follow. To save con- 
fusion, a small dinner card bearing the name of the guest to 
occupy the place, may be on the napkin or at the left of each 
cover; have the name written simply and distinctly. If a rose 



658 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

bud is thrown at the top of the plate, a Httle bow of ribbon on 
each stem, may act as a dinner card, the name being written on 
one end of the ribbon. If menu cards are used, the name may 
be written across the corner of the menu card. These will then 
be carried away as souvenirs. 



SERVING AND WAITING AT TABLE 

A simple, easily prepared menu with a few illustrations may 
serve to show the accepted methods of serving and waiting at 
table.

The cuts illustrate the manner of serving each course, 
and are not in any way supposed to represent table decorating. 

Cover the table with a spotless, white linen cloth, sufficiently 
heavy to hang in graceful folds. Never starch table-cloths or 
napkins. In the centre of the table, place a large vase of roses 
or any suitable flowers. A basket or a rose jar may be substi- 
tuted for the vase. Let the centre piece be simple and plain ; 
avoid lace, ruffles or frills. Washable embroideries only are 



TABLE WAITING 659 

used on elegant tables. If cut flowers are to be used, select 
those free from heavy odor and to correspond with the lighting 
and color of the dining-room. Arrange neatly in small cut 
glass, silver or china dishes, olives, radishes or celery, salted 
almonds and bonbons. Serve olives, radishes and celery with 
sufficient cracked ice to keep them cool. Place the napkin to 
the left of the plate ; knives to the right, blades turned in ; near- 
est the plate the dessert knife, next the meat knife, then the 
fish knife, then the soup spoon, and on the outside, to the right, 
the oyster fork, or place it as shown in the diagram. On the 
left nearest the plate, a dessert fork, then the salad fork, next 
the meat fork, then a small fork for the entree, and last, 
the fish fork. The service will be used from the outside 
toward the plate. Butter is not, as a rule, served at dinner, 
so butter chips or plates are not used. On the right, at the 
'head of the knives, place a tumbler for water and the wine 
glasses. If wine is not used, place a smaller tumbler for Apol- 
linaris. All the plates and silver for a dinner must be gotten 
ready and grouped at least two hours before the serving of the 
meal. A roll or thick bit of dinner bread may be placed on the 
napkin. The knife and fork rests are, as you will notice, on 
the table; also the soup ladle, a spoon for the olives, and a 
small spoon for the bonbons. If individual salt cellars are used, 
one will be placed at the head of each plate. 

A cold dinner plate will be placed first ; and, just as the 
meal is announced, smaller plates containing oysters on the 
half shell, are placed in these. Cover the smaller plate with 
finely cracked ice, and at the last moment sink or work the 
shells down in it ; put a quarter of a lemon in the centre of the 
dish. 

As soon as the guests are seated, the waitress will pass, on 
a small tray, a dish of horseradish, a bottle of tobasco, an extra 
dish of lemon, and crackers or brown bread sandwiches. She 
then pours water and Apollinaris. 

A diflferent set of plates may be used for each course ; but 
the guests must never be left without a plate except when 
crumbing the table after the salad course. 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 

As soon as the oysters are eaten, the waitress will have near 
at hand on the sideboard or side table, the soup service. She 
brings to the table, in her right hand, a warm dinner plate; 
lifting the oyster plate with her left hand, she immediately 
places the new service, and so continues until all plates are 
changed. 

The soup tureen and a few soup dishes are now placed 
before the hostess who ladles the soup into the plates. The 
waitress holding the plates, one at a time, on her left hand, 
close to the left of the soup tureen ; when served she places 
them before the guests from the right with her right hand. 
She now pours the sherry or Madeira, refills the Apollinaris and 
water glasses, and passes the celery or radishes; these are 
served with the soup course. The guests now break the bread, 
unless they have used it with their oysters, which is permissible. 

The fish is being dished in the kitchen, the sauce strained, 
and, with the heatea fish plates, they are placed in the pantry 
ready for service. The waitress now removes the soup tureen ; 
coming back, she brings with her the warm fish plates, put- 
ting them on the side table. Going to the right of each 
guest, carrying in her right hand a warm fish plate, removes 
the soup plates with her left hand, and places the fish plates. 

She now places the fish before the host, the sauce at the 
left-hand side with a ladle for serving ; she places the fish knife 
on his right, and at his left the fork. When she is going back- 
wards and forwards, she, of course, removes the radishes and 
celery. She always lifts the plate with her left and replaces it 
with her right hand. The host carves the fish, helping also the 
potatoes and sauce. The waitress stands at his left, and has in 
her hand the extra heated fish plate. As soon as he has served 
one plate, she lifts it, putting down the extra plate, and carries 
in her right hand the served plate to the hostess, and with her 
left hand lifts the plate that is already there. She now returns 
to the host, lifts the plate in front of him, and with her right 
hand simply puts down the unfilled plate, and so continues until 
all are served. An extra plate saves much time. She serves 
the cucumbers at the side table, and places them at the right 
of each guest. The sherry glasses used are removed, and a 



TABLE WAITING 



661 



white wine poured. She observes the glasses, fills those that 
require filling, and pours the Apollinaris, if necessary. The 
patties are being placed on dainty little mats, in the centre of a 
luncheon plate, in the pantry. 

At the end of the fish course, the waitress lifts first the large 
fish platter and sauce boat and then the cucumber dishes. Com- 
ing back, she brings a plate with patty, lifts the fish plate in 
front of the hostess, and places the patty, and so continues 
until all are served. Olives may now be passed. 

While this course is being eaten, the meat is being dished 
and garnished, also the vegetables. The waitress places the 
carving knife to the right, the fork and steel to the left, of the 
host. She brings the warm dinner plates to the side table; 
when ready she removes, with the left hand, the entree plate 
from in front of the hostess and places a dinner plate, going 
back to the side table she brings another plate as before, and 
so changes each plate at the table. She now goes to the pan- 
try, brings in the turkey, and places it in front of the host ; 
returning, she brings the potato croquettes, peas and cranberry 
jelly. While the turkey is being carved, she places the neces- 
sary silver and refills the glasses, and pours claret or cham- 
pagne. 

If the host does not carve, he simply, by motion, makes this 
known, and the turkey is lifted, carried to the side table, and 
there carved, then placed in front of the host to serve, or it 
may be passed to the left of each guest. The waitress lifts a 
serving spoon from the table, puts it in the peas, rests the dish 
on the palm of left hand, and, going to the left of each guest, 
holds it dovim to the very edge of the dinner plate close to the 
table, so that one may help one's self easily. She next passes 
the potato croquettes ; then the cranberry jelly. She now passes 
the olives, and refills the water glasses, keeping a strict eye to 
the conditions of the table. She slips into the pantry for a 
moment to see if the salad course is nicely dished, the crackers 
toasted and the cheese in order. This has all been ordered 
before dinner, you must remember; but it is well to have it 
overlooked. She stands near the chair of the hostess, paying 
no attention to what is going on in the room, but watches the 



662 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

requirements of each guest ; if the bread has been consumed, 
she passes bread from the sideboard; she may offer vegetables 
the second time. 

At the end of this course, she Hfts the turkey and carries 
it to the pantry, then the vegetable dishes, then the wineglasses 
and olives; nothing is now left on the table but the salted 
almonds and bonbons ; the plates are still in front of the guests. 
She will now bring in a salad plate in her right hand, and with 
her left lift the dinner plate from in front of the hostess; put 
down the salad plate, and so continue around the table, serv- 
ing each course precisely the same. If the salad is dressed at 
the table, she places it in front of the hostess ; on the left hand 
the lettuce tearer, the salad fork and spoon, olive oil, vinegar 
and proper seasonings, with small bowl for mixing. If the 
salad is dressed outside, she simply places it for a moment in 
front of the hostess, who will give it an extra mixing. The 
waitress now lifts the salad dish, arranges the spoon handles 
to one side, places the bowl on the palm of the left hand, offers 
it to the left of each guest, allowing them to help themselves. 
On a small tray, she offers wafers or crackers and cheese at the 
left of each guest. 

At the end of this course, the table is cleared, and for the 
first time the guests are left without a plate in front of them. 
After removing the salad bowl and plates, the waitress removes, 
on a small tray covered with a doily, the salt cellars and all the 
silver, as odd forks and spoons, from the table. Now, with 
folded napkin and tray she quickly removes the crumbs. If 
pieces are left on the table too large to be brushed with the nap- 
kin, lift them with a fork, which she will have on the side of the 
tray for this purpose. 

She now places in front of each, beginning always with the 
hostess, the dessert plates covered with dainty doilies, on top 
of which are placed the finger bowls. These will contain a little 
warm water, scented with violet, or throw in it at the last 
moment, a leaf of geranium or a dainty flower, with a slice of 
lemon. She now brings in the dessert, which in this case hap- 
pens to be a pudding garnished with cherries, and places it in 
front of the hostess ; on the right, a silver cake knife and spoon, 



TABLE WAITING 663 

and on the left a serving fork. Each person Hfts the bowl with 
the doily, and places it just to the left of the dessert plate. The 
hostess dishes a portion of the dessert on the plate in front of 
her, putting at the side a spoonful of hard sauce. The waitress 
carries it to the right of the guest in her right hand, and with 
the left hand lifts the plate that is there. After all are served, 
she passes salted almonds, and goes to the pantry for the coffee. 

On a dainty tray, she brings in the coffee and sugar, placing 
it at the right of the hostess. The small cups, with spoons, are 
then placed; the coffee is poured, the waitress, with a small 
tray, carries two cups and sugar, passing to the left of each 
guest. She then passes the bonbons, refills the glasses, and 
leaves the room. 

If coffee is served in the drawing-room or library, the bon- 
bons are passed there. The waitress arranges the cups in the 
library while the dessert is being finished. She is waiting at the 
door; when the guests enter the library she follows with the 
coffee tray, an ordinary silver salver, placing it before the 
hostess ; as each cup is filled, she passes it on a small tray, on 
which she also places the cut sugar. She then stands near the 
door until the hostess gives her the signal for dismissal. 

This same routine is followed out at the smallest as well as 
at the largest dinners. While this routine may seem compli- 
cated to a few, when once established it gives much comfort 
to the hostess. These directions for table waiting will answer 
for luncheon or a twelve o'clock breakfast as well as for a 
dinner. 



A PLEA FOR THE LITTLE DINNER 

A dinner engagement, no matter whether the dinner be large 
or small, formal or informal, is the most exacting of social 
obligations. Indeed, one feels a double sense of obligation 
when invited to a small dinner. If, among your friends, arc 
physicians, lawyers and politicians, do not invite one of each 
class, nor all of one class simply because their professions 
are the same, but select congenial spirits. Then small, inex- 
pensive dinners, well arranged, are much more enjoyable than 
one large conventional dinner served to sixty ill-selected per- 
sons. The food is better, service better, and digestion better, 
and even where trained help is not employed, the hostess may 
enjoy the occasion as well as the guests. The art of dining 
is quite apart from dinner giving. The person who dines has 
studied the art of living, lives frugally and elegantly. A 
reform in dinner giving is, I am pleased to note, being insti- 
tuted. Simple dinners are now ''the correct thing." 

A hostess must never forget that, during the short time 
her guests are under her roof, she is responsible for their 
happiness and comfort. A huge dinner of twelve courses of 
badly-blended food is not conducive to either. Savarin said, 
"The dinner is the place where men are never bored for the 
first hour ;" the insinuation is that the second hour is frequently 
too long. 

If people in the ordinary walks of life are to make such 
entertainments a success, they must never try new or elabo- 
rate dishes, or even new ways of serving. Simply add an 
extra plate or two to the usual number, and invite your friends. 

The conventional dinner can only be served in the homes 
of the very wealthy, and very few of these succeed in doing 
it well, and but few of their guests enjoy it. Just contem- 
plate for a moment the dinner of ten years ago : Ice-cold oysters 
in quantity sufficient for a whole meal ; hot soup, then fish ; 
releves and entrees ; then a roast, a pause for a highly seasoned, 

664

stimulating punch, to bring the stomach back to life; then 
game, salad, sweets, and another ice. Then coffee as an anti- 
dote, and a wamiing-pan to the poor, chilled stomach. These 
were feedings, extravagant, coarse and vulgar.

SERVING DINNER WITHOUT 
A MAID 

This is, of course, a difficult task, but it can be done if thought 
is given to the first arrangements. Have but few people; it is 
better to have two small dinners than one large one. Prepare 
the soup, a consomme, the day before. Clarify, season and 
strain it ; cover and keep in a cold place. 

For the experimental dinner, select a simple menu, composed 
largely of dishes that can be wholly or partly prepared in the 
morning. 

Consomme Bread Fingers 

Panned Chicken Cream Sauce 

PoTAio Croquettes Peas 

Lettuce Salad 

Wafers Neufchatel Cheese 

Lemon Jelly French Custard Sauce 

Lady Fingers 

Coffee 

The dinner hour is six o'clock. 

After finishing the usual morning work, put parlor and din- 
ing-room in order, go to the kitchen and begin the preparations 
for the dinner. Wash the lettuce, shake, and put it aside in a 
damp cloth on the ice or in the cellar. Make the jelly and cus- 
tard, and put them in the cold. Next make the potato croquettes. 
While the potatoes are boiling, singe, draw, cut up the chickens 
and arrange them at once in the baking pan ; put the butter and 
pepper over, and stand them aside. Make the croquettes; fry 
and put them at once into a baking pan lined with paper. They 
are now ready to run in a hot oven to heat just a moment before 
serving time. Shell the peas, and make the butter balls. This 
preparatory work will take about an hour and a half. Then take

your luncheon and rest awhile. At three o'clock go to the din- 
ing-room and arrange the table. On the side table put the 
crackers, cheese and the necessary extra silver. This may be a 
small table at your left in reaching distance, that you may serve 
without moving from your chair. Place on it also the salad and 
dessert plates. On the side-board arrange the cups and saucers, 
and leave a place for the dessert. All being in readiness, fix the 
kitchen fire, and then go to your room and put the necessary fin- 
ishing touches to your toilet. Put on a large pair of sleevelets 
and an apron, and at five o'clock begin the cooking of the dinner. 
Add a pint of water to the chicken, and put it in the hot 
oven ; in a half hour, add a teaspoonful of salt, and baste it. At 
half-past five o'clock, put the peas over to cook. Turn out the 
dessert and place it on the side-board. Arrange the lettuce; 
make the French dressing, put it in a pretty bowl, and put both 
on the side table. Put the coffee in the pot, and see that the tea- 
kettle is filled. At a quarter of six put the croquettes in the oven 
and the consomme over to heat. Then put the bread and butter 
on the table. Remove your apron, receive the guests and slip 
back to the kitchen. Dish the chicken, make a cream sauce in 
the pan, and stand the platter where it will keep hot. Drain, 
season and dish the peas. Dish the croquettes. Pour the soup 
in the tureen, carry it to the table and announce dinner. Place 
the warm plates, also the chicken, which should be prettily gar- 
nished with- curled parsley, in front of the host. Then take your 
seat, and resume conversation as though you had not left the 
table. At the end of this course, remove the plates and large 
dishes quickly to the kitchen. While there, pour the boiling water 
over the coffee, allowing it to stand over a pan of hot water. Be 
seated. First lift the crackers and cheese, and place them on 
the table. Place the salad plates in front of you ; pour the dress- 
ing over the lettuce, mix and serve it. Pass the wafers and 
cheese. At the end of this course, quietly remove the plates to 
the side table, bring in the coffee, and place it, with the cups, on 
the table. Place the dessert in front of you, also the serving 
dishes. Serve the dessert, then pour the coffee. One can serve 
a small dinner quite easily without a maid, providing the menu 
is simple, and thought is given to the first preparation.

Put the salmon into boiling water; add a tablespoonful of 
vinegar, and boil gently for twenty minutes; drain. Put 
the pint of vinegar and the spice in a porcelain-lined kettle; 
bring to boiling point. Put the salmon in a deep vegetable 
dish or jar, a vessel sufficiently large to hold it without break- 
ing the fish. When the vinegar reaches the boiling point, 
strain it over the fish; stand aside until perfectly cold. Serve 
with a garnish of fennel.

across, then split them through, and sprinkle over half the 
spices. Place the slices in an earthen baking dish; wash a 
half pound of butter, and squeeze it through your hand over 
the top; cover the baking dish, and bake in a moderate oven 
one hour and ten minutes. Lift each piece of fish from the 
baking dish, drain it, and put it on a flat dish. Put another 
half pound of butter in a saucepan, stand it in hot water an(f 
clarify it by thorough melting. Pour off the top carefully 
into the dish in which the fish was cooked. Pound the salmon 
in a wooden mortar or bowl with a pestle, taking out the bones 
as they appear. Add the remaining spices, and garlic, peeled 
and mashed. Add a half pint of clarified butter and the liquor 
from the bottom of the pan. When thoroughly mixed, pack 
into jars, cover the top with butter or paraffin, and stand at 
once in a cold place. This may be used after twenty-four hours, 
and will keep in a cold place for a month. — Miss Cohen.

into balls the size of English walnuts. Drop them into the 
saucepan with the stewing fish, cover closely and cook slowly 
for fifteen minutes. Take from the fire, remove the balls and 
the slices of fish. When the liquor is slightly cool, stir in 
carefully ten eggs, well beaten; stir very slowly over hot 
water; be careful, as this easily curdles. When the consis- 
tency of mayonnaise dressing, take from the fire, add an extra 
tablespoonful ot finely chopped parsley, and :,tand at once 
on the ice. When the fish and sauce are cold, arrange the 
pieces of fish on a flat dish, grouping the balls over neatly. 
Pour over the sauce. Be sure that each piece is carefully 
covered. Garnish with quarters of lemons and large bunches 
of parsley. Serve extra sauce in a boat.

over two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. Place the crust in 
the bottom of the pan, put over the top the apples, currants, 
lemon and orange peel, and citron, thoroughly mixed. Put 
over the top the sugar mixed with the spices, squeeze over 
the juice of the lemons, and sprinkle over the ale. Now cover 
with another thin layer of paste, dust thickly with sugar, and 
bake in a moderate oven four hours. Serve with sauce. 

BLANC MANGE 

3 ounces of isinglass i^ cupfuls of cream 

I pint of milk yi pound of Jordan almonds 

I teaspoonful of almond flavor- 3/2 cupful of sugar 

ing 2 tablespoonfuls of Noyeau 

Cover the isinglass with the milk, stand it aside for fifteen 
minutes, then heat in a double boiler until thoroughly dis- 
solved. Add the almonds, blanched and chopped very fine, 
and the sugar ; take from the fire, and add the cream. Strain ; 
add the noyeau, turn at once into a mold, and stand aside 
to harden. Serve with plain or whipped cream. 

WAVERLY COLLARD BEEF 

Corn a six-pound piece of the thick part of the brisket by 
keeping it in a brine strong enough to float an &gg, adding a 
heaping teaspoonful of saltpetre, one of brown sugar, and a 
saltspoonful of red pepper. Leave it in five or six days, in 
summer; eight or ten, in winter. Use an earthen crock, and 
turn the meat every two or three days. Grate two large car- 
rots, a good sized stick of horseradish, and chop fine a good 
sized bunch of parsley ; mix all together, and spread a thick 
layer on the corned beef, keeping it well to the middle, as it 
presses out when you roll; if your meat is not long, and diffi- 
cult to roll nicely, cut a few pockets in it, and fill with the 
dressing; then roll very tightly, fastening with skewers and 
binding with strong string round and round. Any of the 
dressing that has squeezed out, press back into the open ends 
of the roll (the rolling and tying is comfortably done on a 



JEWISH RECIPES 675 

galvanized tray) ; remove the skewers, then tie up in cheese 
cloth, cover it with cold water, bring slowly to a simmer, 
and let it cook at this point (i8o° Fahr.) four hours. Remove 
the cheese cloth, put the meat on a tray, place a heavy weight 
on it and leave it so over night. Cut off the string. Serve 
cold, cutting thin slices off the end, showing the yellow, white 
and green dressing. This makes a very handsome dish; it 
will keep for a week. 



MATZOTH PUDDING 

4 matzoth A pinch of ground cinnamon 

Yi. pound of stoned raisins Cloves 

Yz pound of sultanas Nutmeg 

Yi. pound of currants i cupful of sugar 

y^ pound of citron 6 eggs 

I small piece of candied lemon y^ pound of chopped suet 
peel 

Chop the suet very fine, removing any shreds. If rum is 
liked, flavor with one-half tumbler of Jamaica rum, and make 
a rum sauce for dressing. 

Beat eggs and sugar well together, add the fruit and then 
the matzoths, which have been well squeezed out of the water ; 
be careful to have them without any lumps ; add spices and 
lastly rum; do not put in all the liquor, as it may moisten it 
too much; add by degrees. This pudding can be boiled or 
baked ; if boiled in a bag, be sure to place a saucer at the 
bottom of the pot to keep it from sticking fast, and put a 
little salt in the water. Boil about three hours. Should the 
water boil away, add only boiling water; cold water will 
make the pudding break. 



SOUP BALLS 

Soak about six matzoths in cold water. Place on the fire in 
a frying pan a little suet, and when boiling hot, put in an 
onion chopped very fine. Drain off the matzoths (do not mash 
them or they will be heavy), and put them in the frying pan; 



676 



MRS. RORER S NEW COOK BOOK 



keep stirring for a few minutes. This does not need cooking, 
only to dry off the matzoths. Have about three tablespoon- 
fuls of finely chopped parsley, and after placing the matzoths 
in a bowl, stir in the parsley with a fork ; add an egg, season 
with red pepper, salt, and a little bit of ginger. Should the mix- 
ture be too moist, add a little matzoth meal; make it suffi- 
ciently dry to roll into balls about the size of a large walnut, 
but they must not be too stiff, just enough so to be able to 
handle them. Keep your hands slightly moistened; the balls 
will not stick then. These balls can be used in a clear beef 
soup or chicken soup, and should be laid in the soup care- 
fully, and cooked gently about ten minutes before serving. 



OKRA SOUP 

2 pound pieces of shin or soup 3 tablespoonfuls of rice 



meat 
^ peck of okra 
4 large tomatoes 
I large onion 



j^ pint of lima beans 
3 ears of corn cut from the cob 
2 tablespoonfuls of chopped 
parsley 
2 pieces of celery 



Season with red peppers and salt. Put the meat on the fire 
in about two quarts of cold water, and after skimming put 
in the vegetables, except the lima beans and corn. Have the 
vegetables cut very fine. Cook slowly about four hours. The 
lima beans should be put in about one hour before serving, 
the corn only ten minutes, and the chopped parsley just before 
serving. This soup is very good without the celery, corn and 
lima beans. 

SPANISH RICE 

Joint one stewing chicken, put in pot with just enough water 
to keep it from burning; season highly with onion, red pep- 
per and salt. Let it simmer one hour ; add a can of tomatoes, 
and let it cook slowly another hour; if the tomatoes are very 
acid, add a teaspoonful of sugar and a pinch of soda ; now 
add a cup of rice, and let it all cook slowly about three-quarters 
to one hour longer, or until the rice and chicken are thoroughly 



JEWISH RECIPES 



677 



tender; add a bunch of parsley, chopped fine. After the rice 
is added, you must watch closely to see that it does not burn. 
Serve on a platter with chicken in the middle and the rice 
around it. If properly cooked and highly seasoned, this is 
a very delicious dish. 



STEWED BEEF AND BEANS (Sweet and Sour) 

Two pounds of brisket, or any part that is fat. Prepare two 
quarts of beans, string, snap short in the usual way as for boil- 
ing, and place in the pot with the meat, with barely enough 
water to cover; season with onion, salt and red pepper; sim- 
mer slowly for three or four hours, or until meat and beans 
are very tender. Fifteen minutes before serving, add one 
tablespoonful of sugar and two of vinegar; the exact propor- 
tions of sugar and vinegar depend on the strength of the 
vinegar. Serve on a platter, with beans around the meat. 



PASSOVER RAISIN WINE 

Take two pounds large bunch raisins, chop them up a little, 
put them in a stone crock, and pour over four quarts of boil- 
ing water, adding half a lemon, cut in thin slices; cover the 
vessel, and let it stand a few days, stirring every day. Strain 
through a cloth, and then strain again through a fine cloth 
or bag; bottle, and set in a cool place. 



MATZOTH SPONGE CAKE 

10 eggs I cupful of matzoth meal 

I pound of sugar Grated rind and juice of one 

lemon 

Beat the yolks with the sugar until very light, then add the 
lemon peel and juice, and the whites of the eggs, which have 
been beaten stiff; then sift in slowly the matzoth meal; beat 
thoroughly, and bake in a slow oven.

SALT WATER CUCUMBERS 

I gallon of water 5 heaping tablespoonfuls of salt 

Yz teaspoonful of red pepper 50 grape leaves 
12 cucumbers 

Put the water, salt and pepper in a two-gallon deep earthen 
jar, and allow it to stand one hour until salt is thoroughly 
dissolved. Wash your cucumbers, which must be of medium 
size and not thick, and put them in the solution. Wash the 
grape leaves and put them on top. Select a flat stone or any 
suitable weight, and place it on top of the leaves so that the 
cucumbers are kept well below the top of the water. If they 
get to the top they will spoil. Throw away the old leaves 
every few days, putting fresh ones on ; keep the jar out of the 
sun, and in a week they are ready to eat ; by using new leaves 
often they will keep about ten days. Place on ice an hour 
before serving, and cut in quarters lengthwise. 

IMPERNARDA 

3 quarts of potatoes i pint bottle of tomato catsup 

I pound of porgies or other (not sweetened) 

cheap fish i good-sized onion 

Red pepper and salt Butter, the size of an ^gg 

Take a gallon size, deep, earthenware, fire-proof crock. Pare 
and slice your potatoes a quarter of an inch thick; put in the 
crock a layer of potatoes, a couple of pieces of fish, and some 
onion; sprinkle freely with salt, red pepper and catsup; now 
another layer of potatoes, and so on until the crock is full ; 
lay the butter on top in small pieces. Pour a large cup of 
cold water in around the edges so as not to disturb the dress- 
ing ; put on top an old plate as a cover, and put it in a moder- 
ate oven, and bake six or eight hours, or until the potatoes 
are thoroughly done, and the fish cooked all to pieces. Use 
plenty of red pepper, as it is intended to be a highly seasoned 
dish. Serve hot from the dish it is baked in. What is left 
over, warm up for another meal in a frying pan, adding a 
little water if it is too dry; there should be considerable 
sauce with it. 



JEWISH RECIPES 679 

WHITE STEWED FISH 

Cut into convenient sized pieces for serving, one pound of 
halibut or rock fish (striped bass). Sprinkle both sides with 
salt ; chop fine a medium-sized onion, and cook it three min- 
utes in a piece of butter the size of an egg; add a scant pint 
of cold water; season with red pepper and a little ground 
mace. Lay in the fish, and boil gently ten minutes. Beat 
the yolks of two eggs stiff; stir in the juice of one large 
lemon. Carefully take the fish out with a skimmer and lay 
on the dish you serve it from. Pour the gravy slowly into 
the egg and lemon, stirring all the time; now pour all back 
into the kettle, and put on the fire and stir until it thickens 
like custard. Add more salt if needed. If it will not thicken, 
add a scant teaspoonful of cornstarch. Take from the fire 
and stir in some chopped parsley ; pour over the fish and serve 
cold. 



A GROUP OF SPANISH RECIPES 

TAMALES 

Singe, draw and truss a three-pound chicken; cook slowly, in 
sufficient water to cover, until tender, adding salt when partly 
done. Open six large red chillies ; wash, rejecting the seeds, cut 
into halves, cover with boiling water, and cook slowly until per- 
fectly soft. Press them through a sieve sufficiently fine to reject 
the skins. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter or olive oil in a fry- 
ing pan ; add one or two medium-sized onions chopped fine ; stir 
until the onion is slightly browned ; add the chilli pulp and a half 
cup of the water in which the chicken was boiled ; cover the pan 
closely ; push it back where it will cook slowly fifteen minutes. 
Put into a bowl one quart of Southern corn meal ; pour over suf- 
ficient water in which the chicken was boiled to make a dryish 
paste ; work this with the hand until it becomes soft but not wet. 
Have ready the corn husks, which must be soaked and pliable. 
Put down the centre of a wide husk a strip of the com meal 
paste; chop the cooked chicken, add the chilli mixture, put a 
layer down the centre of the corn meal in each husk ; roll over 
the husks, fold in the ends and tie them with narrow strips of 
husks. The corn meal must entirely surround the chicken mix- 
ture. It is always wise to use wide husks to make sure that they 
are well wrapped. Put the bones back into the liquor in which 
the chicken was cooked, put the tamales over the top of the 
bones, taking care that they do not touch the water; sprinkle 
over a teaspoonful of salt, cover the boiler and cook continu- 
ously for one hour, being very careful that the water does not 
boil over the tamales. Serve hot. 

MEXICAN TAMALES 

For these use either cooked beef or chicken. Wash, split into 
halves and remove the seeds from one dozen red chillies ; chop

them very fine or put them through a meat grinder. Peel, cut 
into halves and squeeze the seeds from six large tomatoes ; add 
the chillies and a level teaspoonful of salt. Cook slowly a half 
hour. Put one quart of corn meal into a bowl, and add sufficient 
of the water in which the chicken was boiled to scald and just 
moisten; cover and let stand for thirty minutes. Now put a 
strip down the centre of your moistened corn husk ; mix the 
chicken, chopped very fine, with tomato and chilli ; put two 
tablespoon fuls down the centre on top of the corn meal, and on 
this put about twelve stoned raisins ; roll over the husks so that 
the corn meal will entirely cover the chicken ; turn up the ends, 
and tie them carefully. Put the bones of the chicken back into 
the water in which it was boiled ; put the tamales over the top, 
and cook slowly for one and a half hours. Cut the tamales into 
halves, put on a hot platter, and send at once to the table. 

CHILE CON-CANA 

Prepare the chillies in precisely the same way as for tamales. 
After they have been pressed through a sieve, add to them a half 
pint of thick, strained tomato, one large onion, a quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt ; cover and place on the back part of the stove, 
where they will cook slowly for fifteen minutes. Cut the dark 
meat of a boiled or roasted chicken into half-inch cubes ; put 
them into the saucepan and cover with the sauce ; stand over hot 
water for thirty minutes until the chicken has partially absorbed 
the sauce. Serve with rice. Blocks of veal are sometimes 
cooked slowly in the sauce for one and a half hours. 

ENCHILADES 

This is a typical Spanish dish, and is made in two ways; in 
Mexico the paste is made from corn meal, while in Spain they 
prefer the ordinary thin, French pan-cake batter. 

Boil a chicken as directed for tamales. The white meat may 
be used for another dish. Chop the dark meat rather fine; add 
to it two tablespoon fuls of chilli pulp that has been prepared the 
same as for tamales. Beat four eggs, without separating, until 



682 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

light, add one pint of milk ; pour this carefully into four table- 
spoonfuls of flour ; strain through a sieve. Put four tablespoon- 
fuls of olive oil in a saute pan ; when hot put in six tablespoon- 
fuls of the batter ; shake, and when "set," which will take but a 
moment, put at one side two tablespoonfuls of chicken mixture ; 
roll up the pan-cake, and dish on a heated platter. Continue 
until you have a row down the centre of the platter. Pour over 
chilli sauce, spread on each a teaspoonful of grated Parmesan, 
and send at once to the table. These may be flavored with 
onion or garlic. 

JAMBOLAYA 

Singe, draw and cut the fowl the same as for fricassee ; arrange 
the pieces in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and boil rap- 
idly for five minutes ; then draw the pan to a moderate fire, to 
simmer for one hour. Sprinkle over a half pint of finely 
chopped, cold cooked salted tongue, a half cup of well-washed 
rice, a saltspoonful of white pepper, or better still, three chillies 
that have been boiled until tender and pressed through a sieve ; 
cover, and cook slowly for thirty minutes until the rice is tender 
and has absorbed all the water ; watch carefully, as it will scorch 
easily. Strain over a half pint of tomato, and add one table- 
spoonful of butter. Arrange the chicken in the centre of the 
dish, put the rice around and pour over the sauce. 

CASUELA 

Singe, draw and cut up a chicken as for fricassee ; put two table- 
spoonfuls of suet, oil or lard, into a saucepan; add one large 
onion chopped fine, two red chillies ; stir and cook for ten min- 
utes. Add the chicken, and cook until each piece of chicken is 
slightly browned ; then add sufficient boiling water to just cover 
the chicken; simmer slowly until the chicken is tender, about 
one hour. Pare three good potatoes and cut them into dice ; add 
them to the chicken and boil fifteen minutes longer. Boil one 
potato in another saucepan, and mash it through a sieve ; add to 
it while hot the yolks of three eggs, one tablespoonful of vine- 
gar, a level teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper.

Put this into the soup tureen. With a skimmer take the potatoes 
from the casuela, then lift out the pieces of chicken. Strain the 
Hquor from the saucepan into the tureen, mix, add the chicken 
and potato blocks and send at once to the table. 

This takes the place of both soup and meat. Serve with it 
hot corn wafer bread or plain boiled rice.

add a level teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper; chop 
sufficient cold, cooked chicken or other meat to make one pint ; 
add to it the tomato and push on the back part of the stove, 
where it will simmer gently, while you pare and cut into dice 
two good-sized potatoes, and cut the corn from three large ears j 
add the potatoes to the tomato, cook ten minutes, add the com, 
and cook five minutes longer. Serve at once in a heated dish. 
This makes an exceedingly nice supper dish, and takes the place 
of both vegetables and meat.

FRIJOLES 

Wash and soak for one hour one pint of Mexican brown beans ; 
drain off this water, cover with boihng water and cook slowly 
for one hour, or until the beans are rather tender, but not soft ; 
drain. Put in a frying pan or saucepan two tablespoonfuls of 
olive oil or suet ; when hot, add the beans and stir until they are 
carefully browned. Have ready six red chillies that have been 
boiled soft and pressed through a sieve ; add these to the frijoles, 
add a palatable seasoning of salt, one chopped green pepper 
and a half pint of good stock, and the same of thick stewed 
strained tomato ; cover, and stew slowly for thirty minutes. The 
beans must be whole, but tender, and dry to the very centre. 



STEWED GREEN TOMATOES 

Wash and slice six large green tomatoes, the same number of 
onions ; take the seeds from three large chillies, either green or 
red, and cut them also into slices. Put four tablespoonfuls of 
suet, lard or oil into a saucepan, throw in the tomatoes, stir a 
moment until they are slightly browned ; then add one-half pint 
of stock or water, cover and cook slowly for one hour; add a 
level teaspoonful of salt, and they are ready to serve. This is 
frequently served in a border of rice, which gives both green 
and starchy vegetables in one dish.

the tomatoes into small pieces. Put them over the fish, pour 
over the wine, and add sufficient water to just cover the fish. 
Cover the saucepan, put over a quick fire, and boil thirty 
minutes. While this is boiling, remove the crusts from six 
thick slices of bread; toast them in the oven until crisp and 
brown. Then put them into a deep vegetable dish. Remove the 
fish with the skimmer and arrange it neatly in the centre of 
a platter; drain a portion of the broth over the bread, and 
the balance over the fish. Garnish with chopped parsley, and 
send to the table.

chicken in the middle of a platter, put over carefully the rice, 
and send at once to the table. 

PETIT BRULE 

Select perfectly smooth, thick golden skinned oranges; cut 
through the skin at what might be called the equator around 
the orange; then with a spoon-handle loosen the skin from 
the orange almost to the end, and turn it wrong side out, leav- 
ing a cup. Now cut the orange from the cup, leaving the half 
of the orange with a cup on top. Place the orange into a 
dainty plate or saucer; into the cup put one whole clove, a 
tiny bit of bay leaf, a tiny stick of cinnamon, one lump of 
cut sugar, and pour over two tablespoonfuls of the best brandy. 
Bring this to the table with the after dinner coflfee and place 
one in front of each guest. Touch a match to the brandy, 
and allow each person to baste the sugar until the alcohol 
has burned away. Put the remaining contents into the coffee. 
The burning of the brandy in the orange skins with the 
spices, gives the most delicious flavor.

A CREOLE EVENING 

Decorate the room with bright colored flowers, largely red 
and yellow. Have everything as bright and cheerful as pos- 
sible. If you have a highly polished table, use white drawn 
work mats, otherwise have the table covered with a spotless 
white cloth. In the centre have a large bunch of flowers in a 
silver bowl or vase. At one end of the table arrange the coffee 
service, at the other the salad. Have napkins and plates 
grouped with the necessary silver on a side table. On a small 
table in one corner of the dining-room, place the punch bowl 
handsomely garnished with ferns, and the punch glasses around 
the bowl. Fill the bowl half full of parlor punch. The coffee 
must be exceedingly black, and served with hot milk and 
cream. On the table have a plate of sweet pickles, one of 
olives, and several of small cakes.

SAGO SOUP 

Wash a quarter cupful of pearl sago through several cold 
waters, and cook slowly in a quart of water until the sago is 
transparent ; then add a two-inch piece of stick cinnamon, a half 
cup of seeded and chopped raisins, and, just at serving time, a 
half pint of any fruit juice. Add two tablespoon fuls of sugar, 
and serve. 

FISH WITH TOMATO 

For this, purchase a good white-fleshed fish weighing from two 
and a half to three pounds. Wash and dry it, and dust with salt 
and pepper ; brown quickly on both sides in very hot oil ; run it 
into a hot oven and cook for thirty minutes, turning it once or 
twice. Have enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. While 
this is cooking, put into a saucepan four good-sized tomatoes 
that have been peeled, cut into halves and the seeds squeezed 
out. Add a grated onion, a clove of garlic, four whole cloves 
and a bay leaf. Cook for five minutes, and press through a 
sieve. Add a level teaspoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper and 
a tablespoonful of butter; dish the fish, pour over the tomato 
sauce, and send at once to the table. 



PICKED FISH 

Steam carefully any good white-fleshed fish. When done 
remove the skin, pick the fish apart in large flakes. Put a pint 
of milk into a double boiler and add to it, when hot, two round- 
ing tablespoon fuls of butter rubbed with the same quantity of 
flour. Stir until the milk is smooth and rather thick. Rub suf- 
ficient thyme from a bunch to make a tablespoonful. Chop fine 

681 



692 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

two good-sized onions and two chillies ; put a layer of the cream 
sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, then a layer of the fish, a 
sprinkling of onion, chilH and thyme; then another layer of 
sauce, and so continue until you have used all the material, having 
the last layer sauce. Cover with a thick layer of bread crumbs, 
and sprinkle over the top four tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. 
Bake in a quick oven a half hour. 

TO COOK BEEF 

Purchase a thick slice from the upper round ; lard it thickly over 
one side ; brush it with a mixture of one tablespoonful of olive 
oil and one of vinegar. Stand aside for two hours, then baste 
both sides with melted butter. Put it into a baking pan, run 
into a very quick oven, and bake until brown. Then pour over 
it a half pint of sweet cream, to which you have added a table- 
spoonful of soy. Cook slowly for one hour, basting frequently 
with the cream. When done dish the beef in the centre of a 
large platter and garnish with tiny potato croquettes. If the 
sauce in the pan has evaporated, add a half cup of cream and 
about two tablespoonfuls of stock ; stir this until you have taken 
the entire flavor of the meat in the pan. Pour the sauce over 
the meat, and send to the table. 

BEEFSTEAK ROLLS 

Cut from the round very thin slices. Cut these into strips two 
inches wide and four inches long; dust them with a little salt, 
chopped chilli, chopped parsley and just a suspicion of onion. 
Roll them up, the size of your finger, and fasten with two small 
wooden skewers (tooth picks). Dip them in beaten egg, roll in 
bread crumbs and fry in deep, hot fat. 

FRICEO 

Purchase a pound of beef from the round ; cut it into cubes of 
one inch, and then with a potato masher flatten each one with a 
hard blow. Pare and cut into slices three good-sized potatoes. 
Peel and cut into thin slices four good-sized onions. Put in the 



HAWAIIAN RECIPES 693 

bottom of a baking dish a layer of potatoes, then a layer of meat 
and a layer of onion ; dust this with a saltspoonful of white pep- 
per and a saltspoonful of salt. Peel and cut into halves four 
good-sized tomatoes. Chop them rather fine, and add a layer 
to the dish. Cut a level tablespoon ful of butter into four pieces, 
and put it over the tomatoes. Continue these alternations until 
the materials are used. Pour over the top a half cup of thick, 
sour cream. Cover the pudding dish or casserole mold, stand it 
into a pan of boiling water, and cook in the oven two hours.

pour over one pint of boiling water; when cold stir well and 
turn it into a cheese cloth and wring it perfectly dry. Stand the 
milk thus obtained aside. Add another pint of boiling water to 
the cocoanut fibre, wash and strain it again, then throw the 
fibre away. Put the butter in a saucepan, and when hot add the 
chicken; shake and turn until the chicken is nicely browned; 
then add the onion ; cook five minutes ; add the salt, then the 
ginger ; cook five minutes longer ; then add the garlic and cumin 
seed, and last the curry powder; put all these in dry. Cover 
with the last straining of cocoanut milk. Cover the saucepan

two tablespoonfuls of carefully melted butter. 

BAKED TARO 

Moisten the hands with good vinegar, and then scrape off the 
outside of the taro, throwing them at once into cold water. Dry 
them in a towel, and bake the same as potatoes. The very large 
taro may be cut into halves lengthwise. It will take one and a 
half hours for the baking. Eat with a little salt and butter. 

TARO CAKES 

Moisten the hands with vinegar and scrape the taro ; throw into 
cold water, then drop them into boiling water and boil continu- 
ously until tender ; strain and mash them with a potato masher,

COCOANUT PUDDING 

4 tablcspoonfuls of pearl tap- 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar 

ioca I quart of milk 

I cup of grated cocoanut 4 eggs 

Wash the tapioca, cover it with cold water, and let it stand over 
night. Next morning add to it the milk, and cook in a double 
boiler at least ten minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the 
sugar together, add them to the milk and half of the cocoanut ; 
cook for five minutes longer ; take from the fire, and when cold 
turn into a shallow glass dish. Beat the whites of the eggs until 
light; add four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and beat 
again ; spread this over the top, and sprinkle over the remaining 
portion of the cocoanut. Put a piece of thick paper around the 
dish, and run it into a quick oven until slightly brown. 

BANANA PUDDING 

Slice six bananas and stew them with very little water. When 
done, beat them to a pulp ; add four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
turn them into a baking dish. Put a tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour in a saucepan, mix and add a half pint of cocoanut 
milk ; stir until boiling. Take from the fire, and when cold add 
the yolks of three eggs. Beat the whites to a froth, adding the 
custard gradually to them, beating all the while ; add four table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, a quarter of a grated nutmeg; 
pour this over the bananas and bake in a moderate oven a half 
hour. 

BANANA CAKE 

Beat to a cream a quarter of a cup of butter, add a half cup of 
sugar and one egg: when very light, stir in enough flour to 
make a stiff dough ; roll into a thin sheet and line a square, shal- 
low baking pan. Peel five good, ripe bananas, and chop them 
very fine; put them over the crust in the pan, sprinkle over a 
half cup of sugar, the pulp of five tamarinds soaked in a quarter 
of a cup of warm water ; squeeze over the juice of two Japanese 
oranges, put over a tablespoonful of butter cut into pieces, a 



698 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

saltspoonful of mace, and two tablespoonfuls of thick cream. 
Grate over the top two small crackers, bake in a moderate oven 
a half hour, and cut into narrow strips to serve. 



GUAVA SOUFFLE 

Take a dozen ripe guavas, sweet and sour mixed ; wipe with a 
cloth ; mash and press them through a fine sieve ; add one cup of 
powdered sugar, turn at once into punch glasses, and stand 
aside until very cold. Then put on top of each one a tablespoon- 
ful of meringue made by beating the whites of three eggs to a 
stiff froth with three tablespoonfuls of sugar. 



COCOANUT DROPS 

Grate two good-sized cocoanuts ; weigh, and to each pound 
allow a half pound of powdered sugar, a rounding tablespoon- 
ful of cornstarch or rice flour ; mix the sugar and flour together, 
then sprinkle this into the cocoanut, work it with the hands, 
make into little balls, place on tins, and bake in a moderate oven 
until a golden brown. 



GUAVA JELLY 

Wash the guavas in cold water, cut off the dark ends of each ; 
put them into a large kettle, adding sufficient water to prevent 
scorching, about one quart to each peck of fruit; cook slowly 
until reduced to a pulp. Take from the fire, put into bags, and 
drain over night. Next morning measure the juice, and to each 
pint allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Put this into the 
kettle, stand over a brisk fire, and boil rapidly, skimming almost 
constantly. When the juice begins to drop heavily from the 
spoon, almost like a jelly, add the sugar, bring again to boiling 
point, stirring carefully ; skim and try. You will probably have 
at once a thick jelly. Turn quickly into glasses. Use a silver 
knife in removing the blossoms from the ends of the guavas.

TO PRESERVE CITRON 

Wash and wipe the citrons ; cut them into halves or quarters ; 
remove the centre, and throw the rinds into cold water to soak 
for at least five days, changing the water twice a day. At the 
end of this time, put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and cover 
with cold water; boil rapidly for one hour; strain, cover with 
fresh boiling water and boil for another hour ; then drain in a 
colander. To each pound allow one pound of sugar, a half cup 
of water ; put the sugar and water into a kettle, stir until dis- 
solved, bring to boiling point, put in the citron, and cook slowly 
for half an hour. Stand aside over night. Next day lift the 
citron carefully with a skimmer; boil down the syrup, pour it 
over the fruit, let stand for another day, then put into pans and 
stand in the sun to dry. This will take at least three or four 
days. Dust with granulated sugar and keep in a dry place. 
The left-over syrup may be used for some other purpose. 

TO CONSERVE PINEAPPLES WHOLE 

Pare the pineapples and nip out the eyes. Weigh them and 
allow a pound of sugar and a half cup of water to each pound of 
fruit ; put the sugar and water in a kettle, boil and skim. Put in 
the pineapples whole, bring them to boiling point and cook 
slowly for two hours until they seem to be saturated with sugar ; 
take them out, and dry them in the sun. Dust with granulated 
sugar, and roll in waxed paper to keep. 

Pineapples may be cut into slices, and candied in the same 
way. 

PICKLED FIGS 

4 pounds of sugar 2 ounces of stick cinnamon 

I pint of vinegar i tablespoon ful of whole cloves 

I tablespoonful of black peppers (whole) 

Put all the ingredients into a porcelain-lined kettle, bring to 
boiling point, then add seven pounds of figs that have been 
washed and drained. Simmer gently ; when the figs are tender 
take them out with a skimmer, and put them into glass jars. 
Boil down the syrup, pour it over the figs and seal. 



700 MRS. rorer's new cook book 

In many of the Pacific Islands, pineapples and mangoes are 
pickled in the same way. Mangoes should be quite green ; allow 
for them half the quantity of vinegar and sugar, and cook the 
fruit a much longer time. 



PICKLED LEMONS OR LIMES 

3 ounces of chillies 4 ounces of turmeric 

4 ounces of garlic 3 ounces of green ginger 

Put the lemons or limes in a jar, sprinkle thickly with salt, cover 
and let stand for one week. Pound the garlic, chilHes and tur- 
meric together, and add the ginger sHced ; add just enough vine- 
gar to make a paste. Stuff this into the limes, tie them together, 
and stand them in glass or stone jars for one month, and they 
are ready to use. 

STUFFED PRUNES 

Mix together a cup of whole mustard, a half teaspoonful of 
cloves, a half cup of chopped green ginger, a teaspoonful of cin- 
namon, a saltspoonful of white pepper, and three and a half 
pounds of sugar. Push the stones out of seven pounds of 
prunes ; being very careful not to tear the flesh. Fill the spaces 
with the mixture. Put two pounds of sugar and half a pint of 
vinegar into a kettle ; when boiling put in the fruit ; and bring 
again to boiling point. Lift them carefully, and put them in 
jars ; seal. Serve with meat.

HAWAIIAN RECIPES 701 

slow fire until as thick as marmalade. Bottle and seal. The

scraped and cut into thin slices ; the raisins stoned and cut into

4 pounds of green mangoes 2 pounds of raisins 

I pound of almonds 2 ounces of garlic

I pint of vinegar 

Mix the salt and sugar with the mangoes, stand them aside over 
night ; then add all the other ingredients ; put them at once into 
wide-mouthed bottles, and stand aside in the sunlight for two 
weeks. The mangoes should be peeled, skinned and grated ; the 
almonds blanched and pounded to a paste; the ginger scraped 
and sliced.

A LIST OP 

Mrs. Rorcr's Cookery Books 

Published by 

ARNOLD AND COMPANY 

420 Sansom Street, Philadelphia 

Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book 

This book marks the highest point of development in Domestic 
Science, and represents the results of hard work of the best years of 
Mrs. Rorer's life. 

It is not a mere recipe book, but tells of those things one needs 
to know concerning cooking, living, health and best way of house- 
keeping. At the same time, each department has an abundance of 
new and good recipes, given in Mrs. Rorer's clear and lucid style, 
so that no one can possibly make mistakes. 

A magnificent department on vegetables will make the book 
welcome to the growing cult of vegetarians. The scientific division 
of the vegetables into groups, giving their constituents, will prove 
of great value to invalids afflicted with diabetes, kidney disease, etc. 

In all, this book is the most valuable contribution to Domestic 
Science that has yet been published, placing it far above the level 
of the ordinary cook book. 

No household can afford to be without it, if good living and 
correct living are to be desired. 

Large 12 mo, 730 pages, profusely illustrated; 
bound in washable cloth, price J^2.oo ; postage 20 
cents. 



Mrs. Rorer's 
Philadelphia Cook Book 

This book has been before the public a number of years, and 
has been the rule and guide in thousands of homes. It is a valuable 
book for any one to have, even though they possess the New Cook 
Book. It is a standard of excellence, in that it is full of the brightest 
things in cookery; the recipes are absolutely reliable, and the gen- 
eral instructions to housekeepers of the most helpful and necessary 
character. Every recipe has been successfully tested by Mrs. Rorer, 
in class room and home, and found to come out right. This alone 
is of incalculable benefit, and ought to commend the book to the 
favorable consideration of every housekeeper. 

1 2 mo, nearly 600 pages, with portrait of author ; 
bound in washable cloth, j^ 1.7 5. 



Canning and Preserving 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer s New 
Cook Book, etc. 

In this volume Mrs. Rorer discusses at greater length than is 
allowed in the limits of her work on cooking in general, the canning 
and preserving of fruits and vegetables, with the kindred subjects 
of marmalades, butters, fruit jellies and syrups, drying and pickling. 
As in her Cook Book, the recipes are clearly and simply given, 
while an exhaustive index affords easy reference to every subject. 

i2mo, with index; bound in cloth, 50 cents. 



Hot Weather Dishes 

By Mrs S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's New 
Cook Book, etc. 

Its name tells the whole story. It is the only book of the kind. 
Hot weather seems to suspend the inventive faculty of even the 
best housekeepers, and at a season when the appetite needs every 
help and encouragement this book will be found of the greatest use. 
Full of suggestions for tempting and dainty dishes, with recipes 
for presenting the substantial in palatable forms. Contains a 
complete index to all the recipes. 

"A seasonable and appetizing book, entitled Hot Weather 
Dishes, by Mrs. Rorer, has just been issued. It contains table 
recipes for summer use. Salads, vegetables, dishes of hot, or pre- 
viously prepared meats, piquant sauces, fruit omelets and summer 
desserts are particularly attractive." — Philadelphia Ledger, 

i2mo, with index ; bound in cloth, 50 cents. 



Home Candy Making 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's New 
Cook Book, etc. 

A book full of choice recipes, with complete instructions for 
making the many delicacies that delight both young and old. It 
is the result of careful practice in teaching beginners how to make 
attractive, wholesome and palatable varieties of home-made candies. 
As a rule, they are made from uncooked sugar and white of egg, 
and while they may be palatable to some persons, to the connoisseur 
they are coarse and heavy. The excellency of the recipes consists 
in their simplicity and faithfulness to minutiae. 

I2mo, with index ; bound in cloth, 50 cents. 



Mrs. Rorer's 
My Best 250 Recipes 

By Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's 
New Cook Book, etc. 

It would be strange indeed if, out of the multitude of 
recipes Mrs. Rorer has invented and used during her long career 
as a teacher, writer and lecturer, she did not have some that 
appealed to her more strongly than others. She has gathered 
these together, classifying them under their different heads. 
There are Best 20 Soups ; Best 20 Fish Recipes ; Best 20 Meats ; 
Best 20 Salads; Best 20 Desserts; Best 20 Sauces, Vegetables, 
Fruit Preserves, Luncheon Dishes, Ices, Summer Recipes, 
Left Overs, Game and Poultry, Breads and Biscuits, Christmas 
Dainties. A book of this well-selected nature ought to be of 
great assistance not only in the making of the daily home menu, 
but also for all sorts of social functions.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Many Ways for Cooking Eggs 

By Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's 
New Cook Book, etc. 

Did you ever reflect what an important part eggs play in 
our domestic economy?* When from any reason other things 
fail, the perplexed housewife knows she can do something to 
tide over her difficulties by the use of eggs. But how many 
know the great possibilities that lie in an egg — the very many 
ways of cooking and preparing them for the table? To many, 
boiled, fried, poached and scrambled form the limit of their 
knowledge. But get this book and you'll be surprised at the feast 
in store for you. You'll also find recipes for delectable Egg Sauces.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Every Day Menu Book 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's New 
Cook Book, Canning and Preserving, etc. 

In the course of her teaching and editorial work, there have 
come to Mrs. Rorer frequent requests for a book that will provide 
a daily bill of fare, one that will be at once rational, its directions 
easy of accomplishment, and give an excellent variety. Hence 
this Menu Book. 

It contains a menu for every meal in the year, systema- 
tically arranged by months and days ; menus for special occasions, 
such as holidays, weddings, luncheons, teas, etc.; illustrations of 
decorated tables for various social events, with appropriate menus ; 
menus arranged for the season both as to food and decorations ; a 
department of menus without meats. A fine volume that ought to 
commend itself to every housekeeper. 

The Every Day Menus occupy the first 193 pages of the 
book. Then follow the Menus For Special Occasions, such as: 
Golf Luncheon; Birthday Supper; Twelve o'clock Breakfast; 
Family Supper; Young Lady's Luncheon; Russian Tea; Chafing 
Dish Supper; Five o'clock Tea or ''At Home"; Pink Luncheon; 
Japanese Tea; Easter Luncheon ; St. Patrick's Day; Small Evening 
Affair; Dainty Luncheon; Ladies* Luncheon; Thanksgiving Table ; 
May Luncheon; Menus for Small Evening Affairs; Gentlemen's

Dinners ; Christmas Menus ; Company Luncheons ; A Few Lawn 
Suppers ; Morning Weddings or Receptions ; Bridesmaids* Lunch- 
eons; Clover Lunch ; Cobweb Lunch; Chocolatiere ; etc., etc. 

i2mo, 300 pages, handsomely illustrated; bound 
in cloth., $1.50 net; postage 12 cents 



Mrs. Rorer's 

Vegetable Cookery and Meat 

Substitutes 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's New 
Cook Book, Home Candy Making, etc. 

This book has a twofold object: 

1. To show the vahie of vegetables in their relation to diet 
and health, how to prepare, cook and serve them, what to 
eat under certain conditions of health, and thus have them 
perform their proper work. 

2. To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of combinations 
of foods in the shape of toothsome recipes to take the place 
of meat, or as we call them — Meat Substitutes. 

It goes without saying that we all know too little about the 
value of vegetables as food. We eat them because they are 
palatable, not realizing their immense importance as body builders. 
Here they are classified, and thus made to give us a right idea 
of their use. 

Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary to be a 
vegetarian to desire a change from a meat diet. There are health 
reasons often demanding abstention from meats ; or economy 
may be an impelling motive; or a desire for change and variety 
in the daily bill of fare may be warrant enough. However we 
look at it here is the wonder book to point the way to better 
and healthier living. 

There is an abundance of the choicest and most palatable 
recipes, and they are given in such a manner that if the directions 
are followed, the results are sure. You cannot make mistakes. 

i2mo, cloth, $1.50 net; by mail, $1.62. 



Mrs. Rorer's 
Cakes, Icings and Fillings 

By Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's 
New Cook Book, etc. 

Every one is interested in the cake problem. There is possibly 
no item in the home bill of fare on which a woman prides herself as 
the ability to make a good cake. But how to add variety to the 
goodness ? Here's the book to help. Contains a large number of 
enticing and valuable recipes for cakes of all sorts and conditions. 
Some need filling, some need icing — well, here you have all the 
necessary information. Best of all, there is no fear as to results. 
Follow the directions and your cake is bound to come out right. 

l2mo, cloth, 50 cents net; by mail, 55 cents 

Mrs. Rorer's Dainties 

A book for all occasions. By Mrs. Sarah Tyson 
RoRER, author of Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book, etc. 

Possibly no part of the daily bill of fare so taxes the ingenuity 
of the housewife as the dessert, that final touch to the meal that 
lingers in the palate like a benediction. We tire of constant re- 
petitions of familiar things. We want variety. Why not have it 
when there are so many ways and means of gratifying our tastes. 
Mrs. Rorer has given here a number of choice things covering quite 
a range of possibilities. Among the contents we might mention 
Appetizers, Vegetable Cocktails, Fruit Cocktails, Punches, Small 
Cakes, Simple Candies, Dainties to take the place of Cakes, Desserts, 
Frozen Puddings, Ice Cream, Sauces, etc. The book is certainly 
helpful, and can well be regarded as a mainstay in everyday affairs.

New Salads 

For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions. 
With a group of Odd Salads and some Ceylon 
Salads. By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. 
Rorer's New Cook Book, etc. 

In this book are gathered together a choice lot of original 
recipes for the proper making and serving of this important dish. 
The salad is not alone for the epicure, nor is it to be looked upon 
merely as a tasty bit to enliven a meal. It should form a part of 
the daily cuisine in every family. Judging from the statements 
of the author, not enough attention is paid to this matter by the 
average housekeeper. 

Long i6mo, with index; bound in cloth, 50 cents. 



/ Made-Over Dishes 

How to transform the left overs into palatable and 
wholesome dishes. With many new and valuable 
recipes. By Mrs S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. 
Rorer's New Cook Book, etc. 

We quote from the author's introduction: "Economical 
marketing does not mean the purchase of inferior articles at a 
cheap price, but of a small quantity of the best materials found 
in the market; these materials to be wisely and economically used. 
Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a piece too much, 
is a good rule to remember. In roasts and steaks, however, there 
will be, in spite of careful buying, bits left over, that, if econom- 
ically used, may be converted Into palatable, sightly and wholesome 
dishes for the next day's lunch or supper." 

Long i6mo, with index; bound in cloth, 50 cents. 



Bread and Bread-Making 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's New 
Cook Book, etc. 

Bread forms such an important part of the daily fare, that a 
book like this ought to be warmly welcomed by housewives every- 
where. It contains a chapter on wheat and how to properly select 
flour; then follow directions for mixing, kneading, molding and 
baking, with a chapter on yeast. The recipes cover the ground of 
bread-making completely. In the list we find white wheat bread, 
whole-wheat bread, French and Graham bread, Nineteenth Cen- 
tury, Golden Loaf, Swedish, etc. Then there are the Small Breads, 
such as Vienna Rolls, Pocket Book Rolls, Crumpets, Muffins, Ger- 
man Horns, Nuns' Puffs, etc. A chapter on Second Cooking of 
Bread gives us Zwieback, Toasts, Pulled Bread, etc., followed by 
Quick Breads, Steamed Breads and Sweet Breads. 

Long i6mo, with index ; bound in cloth, 50 cents.

How to Use a Chafing Dish

New Ways for Oysters 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's New

A set of charming and beautiful volumes, designed to meet the 
special wants of a numerous class of housekeepers who are given 
to entertaining, and are so often at a loss to know what and how 
to prepare for their guests. They have been entirely rewritten and 
enlarged to twice their former size by the addition of new and 
up-to-date recipes.
