INTRODUCTION. 

The name of this book is "The Never Fail Cook Book." It i- a 
story of cooking, and it will not fail if the rules are carried out just as 
they are given here. The recipes are economical, and yet they make 
high-class dishes at a very small price. Something can be made out of 
nothing, practically speaking. This book once used, will never be Ian? 
aside. 



Suggestions for using these Recipes. 

Please read them over, carefully, before making any attempt to do 
any cooking. 

When making a cake, be sure that the oven is hot before putting 
the pan in, and after this has been done, do not open the door 
again for fifteen minutes. 

It is always best to have all necessary ingredients at your side before 
starting to make anything, as you are liable to forget something, othei- 
wise. 

In cooking eggs never leave them on the stove any longer than the 
time required for them to cook, as they will be too done, if you do so. 
Never cook a three minute egg two mi lutes before the time it is wanted 
and put it aside to keep hot, for if you do it will be found to be too done 
when broken. A soft boiled egg should not be cooked until you are 
ready for it.

Hints on Frying Fritters. 

In frying fritters, drop a tiny bit of the dough in a quanity of hot fat at 
first, and if it fries all right, that is, gets a light brown, it is all right for the 
rest of the dough. If the fat is too hot the fritters will brown and be raw inside. 
If the fat is too cold, they will be grease soaked. When any thing is to be fried, 
fish, for example, the pan must be well greased, or the fish will break apart. 

Let this book be your guide; if you do, your cooking will be all right. If 
you do not, your cooking is likely to be spoiled.
