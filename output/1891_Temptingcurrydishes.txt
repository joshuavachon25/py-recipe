Introdtictory. 



In the second and third centuries three mighty Hindoo kings were re- 
nowned for their cookery. They were Nat a, the king of Nishadhades, whose 
fame for dressing and preparing excellent dishes made his kingdom famous. 
He reigned in the second age. 

The second was Bhinia, who reigned in the third age. He was so devoted 
to the culinary art that for a whole year he served in the capacity of Valala, or 
cook to Virat Rajah, King of Panchala Nagur. 

The third was King Pakasasana, who was not only stiperintendent of the 
preparation of celestial food, but was also a distinguished chef. 

The secret of the cuisine of these noted cooks was a mysterious powder, 
which, when added to their dishes, cured disease, as well as appeased the appetite. 
Those who partook of their food died only of extreme old age or by accident. 
No record can be found where the fevers of the country carried them off. 

In an ancient cookery book printed in the Sanscrit language, are preserved 
many of the formulas and recipes used by these kitigly cooks and their successors. 
The " mysterious powders " which they used were a combination of various fruits, 
spices, condiments, roots, seeds, etc., which were either pounded together dry or 
worked to a paste and dried afterwards. T here were hundreds of these prepa- 



rations which were used in different dishes ; each dish had its own separate pow- 
der . They are hiown to modern civilization as Curry powders. 

To-day almost every nation has its own appropriate Curry powder and its 
own Curry formulas. 

The Curry powders of Englatid are particularly suited to the damp, foggy 
weather of that country, but they are no more suited for this climate than are 
the heavily brandied Champagnes which are of a necessity used in England 
and Russia. 

A short time ago the members of the famous New York Chafing Dish Club 
decided to hold a series of practical sessions in Curry cookery, with a view to 
determinifig which Curry powder on the New York market was the most appro- 
priate for the United States, at the same time was made of the purest and most 
wholesome ingredients. 

Over forty different Curry powders were tasted. A number of disting- 
uished English epicures were present afid took part in the contest, with a view to 
demonstrate that the English preparatio7is were the best. The different bottles 
were wrapped iti paper so that the labels of the powders could not be seen. Each 
package was nutnbered, and it was the universal opinion of the experts that 
Ntanber 7 was the best of the lot. When the wrapper was removed Ntunber 7 
was found to be the Ctirry powder of fAMES P. SMITH &= COMPANY, 
Park Place, New York.

Cuny Oil. 



One of the agreeable and at the same time useful oils which should 
find a place on the shelf of every kitchen or butler's pantry, is known 
as Curry Oil. It is made by putting into a six-ounce, large-mouthed, 
glass stopper bottle two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, 
then filling up the bottle- with Antonini Olive Oil. In a week it 
will be ready for use. A few drops of it should be added to sauces 
and salads. 



Curry Vinegar. 



Put into a pint of good cider or wine vdnegar a tablespoonful of 
J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, shake it well from time to time, and in 
ten days it will be fit for use. It is excellent for flavoring soups, etc. 



Curry Essence. 



Add three ounces of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder to a quart of 
white wine vinegar. Put the bottle into a pot of warm water and 
cork it the same as in cooking beef tea ; let it boil an hour, then 
place at one side to cool and settle. When thoroughly settled pour 
off the clear liquid and use for flavoring soups and sauces. 



II 



A ^luick Curry Sauce. 



Add to half a pint of drawn or melted butter a teaspoonful of J. 
P. Smith's Curry Powder and a tablespoonful of Epicurean Sauce, stir 
and serve with broiled or boiled fish, meats, etc. 



13 



Table Sauce, No. 2. 



Put into a quart bottle two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry- 
Powder ; three cloves of garlic, cut fine; half a teaspoonful of J. P. 
Smith's Amboyna Cloves, ground ; a pint of Epicurean Sauce, and fill 
the bottle with claret or Burgundy vinegar. Shake well from time to 
time and use after two weeks. It will be found superior to Worces- 
tershire Sauce. 



14 



A Delightful Table Sauce. 



Put into a pint bottle two tablespoonfuls of James P, Smith's 
Curry Powder, fill the bottle with either walnut or mushroom catsup, 
shake frequently ; the sauce will be ready for use in ten days. These 
sauces may be purchased at the grocer's, or the mushroom catsup 
may be made as follows from field mushrooms : 

Cover the bottom of a porcelain or crockery dish with fresh mush- 
rooms, sprinkle over them a liberal quantity of salt ; on top of the 
salt place another layer of mushrooms, then another thin layer of 
salt, and so on until the mushrooms are used up. Let the dish stand 
twelve to fifteen hours, then rub the pulp through a sieve. Put it into 
a stone jar, place the latter in a pan of water and let it simmer 
until the quantity is reduced one half. To keep it add a gill of brandy 
to every quart of sauce. To make it into a delightful table sauce add 
two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder to each pint ; shake 
frequently ; when cool, put away in well-corked bottles.

A Refreshing Tonic. 



One of the most delicious of refreshing tonics is prepared with an 
overflowing teaspoonful of Maggi Bouillon, half a pint of boiling 
water, seasoned with a pinch of J. P. Smith's inimitable Curry Powder. 
A great many object to the peculiar taste which prepared bouillon, 
beef extracts, etc., usually possess, but with the addition of this 
particular Curry it is an impossibility for even the most exacting 
palate not to appreciate the compound. 



17 



Mulligatawny Soup. 



Put into a frying pan a tablespoonful of Antonini Olive Oil ; when 
hot add a cut up red onion and fry brown ; next add a tablespoonful 
of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, cook a moment and add a pint of 
chicken broth or a pint of hot water and a tablespoonful of Maggi 
Bouillon. Pour the contents of the frying pan into two quarts of 
rich chicken broth, thicken slightly with a tablespoonful of rice flour, 
taste for salt, and serve. This is the family method of making this 
excellent soup. The meat of a chicken cut into squares may be used 
in this soup. 



Curried Apples. 



Apples thus prepared are more toothsome than the ordinary 
spiced apples. Peel and core six large Greening apples. Mix together 
half a pound of butter, half a pound of brown sugar, a tablespoonful 
of vinegar and a teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder; fill the 
holes with the mixture, put them in a buttered tin, and bake. When 
cold serve with cold meats. 

Crab apples boiled in sugar and flavored with Curry, form an 
agreeable relish for cold game.

A Dainty Shrhnp Curry, 



Put into a chafing dish, or frying pan, a tablespoonful of Antonini 
Olive Oil, a teaspoonful of chopped onion and fry a delicate brown, 
then add a teaspoonful of James P. Smith's Curry Powder. Allow 
the powder to cook a moment, then add a pint of water and a table- 
spoonful of Maggi Bouillon. If the latter is not to be had, then add 
a pint of beef stock instead of the water ; simmer ten minutes, and 
add a teaspoonful of rice flour dissolved in cold water. Let boil until 
it thickens slightly, then strain into another dish. Open a can of 
Barataria Shrimps, rinse them off with cold water, add them to the 
Curry sauce, warm up the dish, then pour over it three tablespoonfuls 
of fresh orange juice, a teaspoonful of dry sherry, and serve. 



21 



Boiled Rice for Curry Dishes. 

Alas ! how very few can say they can boil rice properly. It is a most 
difficult feat to many an expert cook, and yet it is very simple, when 
one knows how. The essential point to be gained is that after boil- 
ing, each grain must be distinct and unbroken, yet tender and to 
every appearance fairly ready to burst. To accomplish this a small 
quantity of rice must be cooked in a large volume of water. An 
ordinary half pint cup full of rice should be boiled in at least a gallon 
of water. It will surprise the uninitiated when they compare the bulk 
of the rice before and after cooking. The rice should be first well 
washed in several waters ; reject all husks and imperfect grains, put 
the rice into cold water slightly salted, and boil about twenty-five 
minutes. Old rice requires a little longer cooking. The grains should 
occasionally be tested, and when a slight pressure will crush them they 
are done. If boiled until the grains burst, the rice is spoiled for serving 
with Curry. If boiled in a small volume of water the rice is also 
rendered useless, as the grains will stick together. After boiling the rice 
should be placed over the range where it will throw off the moisture ab- 
sorbed in the boiling. Should any water remain it should be carefully 
kept for soups, sauces, etc., as it is quite as nutritious as the rice itself. 



Shrimp Curry, No. 2. 



Fry a minced onion with a tablespoonful of Antonini Olive Oil ; 
when brown add a heaping tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Pow- 
der, a teaspoonful of rice flour, and a heaping saltspoonful of salt. 
Stir to prevent burning, add a pint of hot water or broth. Cook until 
the sauce thickens slightly, strain and add a square of sugar, a heaping 
tablespoonful of either Chutney, currant jelly, apple, or cranberry 
sauce. Put into the sauce a can of shrimps, let the whole warm 
through thoroughly. Arrange on a platter a border of boiled rice, 
put the Curried shrimp in the centre, squeeze over the shrimp the 
juice of a lime, and over the rice sprinkle the juice of an orange. 



23 



Curry of Cray Fish. 



Crayfish are to be had in the New York market at all seasons. 
They inhabit fresh water streams almost everywhere, but the West 
furnishes the best and largest which are sent to the New York 
market. In the fall, large quantities of them are put into cold storage 
houses for winter use. They are usually sold already boiled and 
shelled, but in summer are to be had alive. The former is the most 
advantageous way of buying them, as they require but little prepara- 
tion. Served as a Curry they are excellent. To cook them follow 
instructions for shrimp Curry, substituting crayfish for shrimps. 



24 



Curry of Prawns. 

The prawn, although resembling the shrimp and the crayfish, 
is larger than either of the other Crustacea, They have a more 
pronounced flavor, and are at their best served as Curry. Select a 
quart of boiled prawns, pick them over carefully to see that all shell 
has been removed, rinse in cold water a moment, and dry them in a 
napkin. Put into a frying pan a heaping tablespoonful of butter; 
when hot add a chopped spring onion or a young leek, cook a few 
moments, and add a heaping teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry 
Powder; stir to prevent burning, allow it to cook a moment, and 
add half a pint of hot water, or beef stock, one small sour apple, 
peeled, and cut into dice, a square of sugar, and a teaspoonful of 
Epicurean Sauce. Cover and simmer until the apple is cooked, 
then add another half pint of beef broth, or hot water containing 
a tablespoonful of Maggi Bouillon, stir well and rub through a small 
strainer ; add the prawns to the sauce, heat them through, season 
with a small quantity of salt and a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, 
pour the Curry onto a hot platter, surround it with a border of 
boiled rice, squeeze over the Curry the juice of half a lemon, and serve. 

25 



Curry of Scallops, 



Wash, drain, and scald, a pint of scallops ; put them into a sauce- 
pan, add half a teaspoonful of salt, small piece of a bay-leaf, three 
whole cloves, and a pint and a half of milk ; boil thirty minutes. In 
a frying pan prepare a Curry sauce as follows : Put into the pan a 
tablespoonful of Antonini Olive Oil in which a few cloves of garlic had 
been steeped, add two teaspoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, a 
chopped sweet Spanish pepper and a gill of beef broth, or hot water 
containing a teaspoonful of Maggi Bouillon ; cover and cook five 
minutes. Add a pint more of the liquid, a teaspoonful of rice flour 
dissolved in cold water, two tablespoonfuls of mild Chutney, and the 
grated outside peel of a lemon ; stir and simmer a few moments. 
Drain the scallops, put them in the centre of a hot platter, surround 
them with the sauce without pouring any of it over them ; around the 
outer edge arrange a neat border of hot boiled rice, and send to table 
with a sauce-boat full of fresh orange juice. 

26 



Curry of Frogs. 



Proceed as per recipe for Curry of Scallops, with the exception 
that the frogs require one hour's cooking in the milk. They may 
then be served the same as the scallops, or put into the sauce and 
warmed up in it A much plainer Curry sauce may be prepared if 
so desired. 



27 



Curry of Oysters, 



Put into a frying pan two tablespoonfuls of Antonini Olive Oil, 
add a scant tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, a chopped 
Bermuda onion, and cook until the onions are quite brown ; stir fre- 
quently to prevent burning. Add a pint of oyster liquor, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, simmer until reduced one-third, then strain; add to 
the sauce a dozen large raw oysters. When they are thoroughly 
heated through and the gills begin to curl, they will be cooked suffi- 
ciently. Serve with hot boiled rice. 



28 



Curry of Crab. 



Prepare a plain Curry sauce as for Oyster Curry, and in the sauce 
put the contents of a can of crab meat ; when warmed through it is 
ready to serve. The fresh crab meat from the shells is of course 
superior to the canned article, but it is more troublesome to prepare. 
Before sending to table squeeze over the dish the juice of a fresh lime. 



29 



Soft Shell Crahs Curried. 



Select half a dozen fine large soft shell crabs, remove the sand- 
pouch and the feathery gill like parts found under the side points of 
the shells. Mix together to a paste in a mortar a clove of garlic, a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's 
Curry Powder, a tablespoonful of Epicurean Sauce, and the juice of a 
lemon. If the paste is too thick, thin out with orange juice; cover 
the crabs with this paste, dip them in beaten &ggy then in cracker or 
bread crumbs and fry like doughnuts. To be eaten cold. 



30 



Curry of Lobster. 



Kill two live lobsters, remove the meat from the tails, split each 
tail piece in two lengthwise, and remove the entrail found therein ; 
cut the meat into inch pieces. Put into a frying pan two tablespoon- 
fuls of Antonini Olive Oil, when hot add the lobster, toss the pieces 
about a few moments, and strew over the meat a tablespoonful of J. 
P. Smith's Curry Powder. Cook fifteen minutes, stirring continually ; 
add the juice of two Florida oranges, then quickly remove the pan 
from the fire and when the agitation in the pan ceases, serve on toast. 
Dainty rice croquettes may be served with the dish. 



31 



Curry of Lobster, No. 2. 



Use the meat of two boiled lobsters, cut it into neat pieces ; take 
all green fat and coral, and set them aside ; mix the green fat with a 
heaping spoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder. Squeeze out the 
juice of three limes, and add to it half a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar. Put into a frying pan an ounce of butter ; when creamed add 
a teaspoonful of minced onion, brown it a little, now add the mixed 
Curry Powder ; dissolve a teaspoonful of rice flour in cold water, add 
this to a pint of hot water or soup stock, stir into the pan, and simmer 
till thick ; now add the lobster, and simmer fifteen minutes longer. 
Wash and dry the coral, separate it. Prepare a border of rice on a 
dish, and over it sprinkle the coral and eggs, if any — put the Curry 
in the centre, and serve. 

32 



Curry of Clams. 



Both the Little Neck and the paper shell clams are very good 
served as a Curry ; only the body part of the soft clam should be 
used, as the remainder is somewhat tough. The Little Necks, if 
cooked too much, will be tough. Serve them with a plain Curry 
sauce. 



33 



Curry of Salmon, 



Fresh cold boiled salmon may be served as a Curry, and a salmon 
steak, cooked in a Curry sauce until it is done, is very good eating, 
but there is no better way of serving canned salmon than as a Curry. 
The only point is to be sure to buy the best known brand of salmon. 
Fry a minced onion brown, with an overflowing tablespoonful of 
Antonini Olive Oil, add two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry 
Powder, let cook a moment and add a pint of hot water, a table- 
spoonful of flour dissolved in cold water, a tablespoonful of tomato 
catsup, or Chutney, and a little salt, stir and simmer until the sauce 
thickens, then add the contents of a one-pound can of salmon to the 
sauce ; let it warm through before serving, and send to table with hot 
boiled rice, or other cereal, such as hominy, cerealine, etc. 

34 



Fish Curries, 



Cold fish of any kind may be advantageously served the next day 
in the form of a Curry. All that is necessary is to warm up the fish 
in the sauce ; care must be exercised, however, not to break or sepa- 
rate the fish into too fine pieces. 



35 




36 



Curry of Chicken. 

Unjoint the chicken and cut the large pieces in two. Put into a 
frying pan two tablespoonfuls of Antonini OHve Oil, and when hot 
fry the pieces of chicken in it until they are partially cooked ; remove 
the chicken, add another tablespoonful of oil, and a minced Bermuda 
onion ; when brown add two tablespoonfuls of J. P. Smith's Curry 
Powder. Return the chicken to the pan with half a pint of hot 
water, cover and set on back of range to simmer half an hour. Add 
a pint of hot water to the pan, strain the sauce to remove the onion, 
if objectionable. Dissolve a tablespoonful of rice flour in a gill of cold 
water, stir it into the sauce with half a teaspoonful of salt, or use a 
teaspoonful of Manioca instead of flour. When the sauce thickens, 
add the chicken (provided it had been removed to facilitate the 
straining of the sauce), and allow it to stand an hour before serving. 
When ready for the table, put the Curry on a hot platter, and serve 
with hot boiled rice and a Chutney sauce. 

37 



Chicken Curry, No. 2. 



Prepare the Curry sauce as before described, and in it warm up 
slices of cold roast or boiled chicken, or turkey. 



38 



Chicken Curry, No, j. 



Cut up a dry-picked roasting or spring chicken. Rub into the 
pieces a Hberal quantity of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, dry. Fry 
the pieces thoroughly in four tablespoonfuls of Antonini OHve Oil; 
when done serve with a tomato sauce well flavored with a few drops 
of Tobasco sauce. If for breakfast, serve with Manioca griddle cakes. 



39 



Cuny of Duckling. 



The spring duckling is delightful eating, but its peculiar flavor is 
not always relished at first ; they are best broiled. Split the bird 
down the back, rub Antonini Olive Oil over it, sprinkle over it a small 
quantity of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, then broil on both sides. 
When done squeeze over the bird the juice of a Florida orange. 



40 



Curry of Squab. 



Squabs treated in the same manner as the duckling are most 
appetizing. They are excellent for cold luncheon, for picnics, colla- 
tions, etc. The wild squab partially fried, then allowed to stand in 
a Curry sauce half an hour before serving, is good eating. 



41 



Curry of Venison. 



Cold roast venison makes a very good breakfast Curry, as the 
meat is tender and digestible. Put in a frying pan, a tablespoonful 
of Antonini Olive Oil, half a teaspoonful of dry flour, brown it slightly. 
Add a clove of garlic and a tablespoonful of minced apple, a tea- 
spoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, and half a pint of hot water, 
or venison gravy from the roast of the day before. Simmer and set 
on the back of the range. Cut the meat in neat pieces, add it to the 
sauce, and when quite hot send to table. Before serving, add the 
juice of a Florida orange. 



42 



Curry of Venison, No. 2. 



The pieces of venison which are not large enough for steaks or 
for roasting purposes may be thus prepared. Cut a pound of the 
meat into inch squares and toss them about in a frying pan, with an 
overflowing tablespoonful of Antonini OHve Oil ; after cooking five 
minutes add a tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder and a gill 
of hot water containing a teaspoonful of Maggi Bouillon ; cover. 
While this is cooking, cut two medium sized raw potatoes into small 
dice, and add them to the meat with half a teaspoonful of salt. The 
steam will cook the potatoes in ten minutes. Mix the ingredients 
together and if too dry add a little more hot water. 



43 



Curry of Rabbit. 



Select two fine rabbits, cut them into neat pieces ; put into an 
earthen crock a thin sHce of bacon, add a few slices of rabbit, sprinkle 
over it a little of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, salt, fresh grated cocoa- 
nut, and a dozen raisins ; put in another layer of rabbit meat, and 
season it as the first layer, repeat until the rabbit is all used, and you 
have also used the juice and meat of one fresh, or half a pound of 
dry cocoanut ; moisten the whole with Rhine wine ; let this stand 
twenty-four hours, then place the crock in a pot of water and simmer 
three hours. While cooking, the crock must be tightly covered. 
Serve with hot boiled rice and over the meat squeeze the juice of a 
lime. 



44 



Curry of Hare. 



Skin, clean, and quarter the hare and rub each piece well with 
J. P. Smith's Curry Powder. Put into a saucepan a tablespoonful of 
beef drippings, a sliced onion, the pieces of meat, half a teaspoonful 
of* salt, and a gill of claret. Cover and simmer an hour ; add another 
gill of claret, two heaping tablespoonfuls of currant jelly, two 
squares of sugar, and simmer two hours longer. Serve with boiled 
rice, over which sprinkle a little orange juice. 



45 



Curry of Beef , 



The best piece of meat for this dish is the lean part of the flank, 
which, being cross-grained, allows the Curry to thoroughly assimi- 
late with every particle of the meat. Cut up one pound of the meat 
into neat square pieces. Put into the frying pan one ounce of Anto- 
nini's Olive Oil, or butter, and fry in it a minced onion, stirring until 
brown ; add the beef and stir to prevent burning ; now add a tea- 
spoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder and half a pint of rich gravy, 
salt, simmer, squeeze out the juice of one Florida orange, sweeten it 
a little, add it to the dish, add a heaping teaspoonful of apple sauce, 
stir and simmer nearly an hour. 



46 



Curry of Beef , No. 2. 



Fry an onion brown with two tablespoonfuls of Antonini Olive 
Oil, add a heaping tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, a pint 
of hot water, a tablespoonful of Maggi Bouillon, a tablespoonful of 
Epicurean Sauce, a teaspoonful of Manioca, half a teaspoonful of salt 
and a tablespoonful of tomato catsup. Simmer three-quarters of an 
hour, and in this sauce warm up slices of cold roast beef. 



47 



Curried Veal Chops. 

Mix together a heaping tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry 
Powder, two saltspoonfuls of salt, a teaspoonful of made mustard, a 
dash of cayenne, a teaspoonful of Epicurean Sauce and Antonini 
Olive Oil, enough to make a paste ; spread a little of this on both sides 
of the chops, then dip in beaten &%^, roll in bread crumbs, and fry in 
a large quantity of fat. They may be served with or without tomato 
sauce, and either hot or cold. 



49 



Curry of Veal. 



Cut up one pound of raw leg of veal into pieces. Mix a teaspoon- 
ful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, half a teaspoonful of rice flour, and 
a saltspoonful of salt together, dip the meat in melted butter or oil, 
then roll each piece in the powder and fry until a delicate brown all 
over (onion may be added or omitted). Mince half a sour apple and 
fry it with the meat ; add half a pint of soup stock, simmer half an 
hour, squeeze over all the juice of half a lemon, mix and serve. 



50 



Curry of Sweetbreads, 



Select two pair of fine sweetbreads, scald them and remove from 
them all sinews, etc. Put them into water slightly salted, cover and

Wash the brains in several waters, then scald and free them from 
sinews ; boil in water seasoned with salt, a gill of vinegar, a clove of 
garlic, and a small piece of bay-leaf. Cook an hour, put the brains 
in the centre of a dish, surround it with a well made Curry sauce. 



52 



Curry of Calf's Feet. 



Boil the calf's feet, after cleaning them, five hours ; then serve 
them with a well made Curry sauce, or rub them well with Antonini 
Olive Oil ; sprinkle J. P. Smith's Curry Powder over them, and broil ; 
when done place on a hot dish, squeeze over them the juice of a lemon 
and serve. 



S3 



Curried Calf s Head. 



Cut cold boiled calf's head into neat square pieces. Beat together 
the yolks of three eggs, add to it a tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's 
Curry Powder, a teaspoonful of Epicurean Sauce, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt ; in this dip the pieces of cold calf's head, roll each piece 
in cracker crumbs, again dip in the ^%^, again in the crumbs, and fry,

Scald four lamb kidneys, skin and split them, aiid let them stand 
in water slightly salted two hours. Wipe them dry in a kitchen towel 
and cut them into pieces. Pour into a soup plate a gill of Antonini 
Olive Oil, put the kidneys in this and move them about in the oil so 
that each piece will be glazed with the oil. Strew over the kitchen 
table a quantity of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, roll the oiled kidneys 
in this. Put into a frying pan two tablespoonfuls of the olive oil, 
when very hot add the kidneys, and a little salt. Shake the pan well 
to prevent burning, cook rather rare, as they will be tough if well 
done. 



59 



Curried Veal Kidneys. 



Split two veal kidneys in two, skin them and allow them to stand 
in cold water, salted, three hours. Drain and wipe dry. Cut them 
into thin slices and cook them half an hour in a good Curry sauce as 
before described. 



60 



Curried Ox Tails. 



Cut two ox tails at the joints, and fry them in a little Antonini 
Olive Oil five minutes. Have cooking in a saucepan a minced onion 
with a thin slice of bacon and a heaping tablespoonful of J. P. Smith's 
Curry Powder. Add the ox tails, quarter of a bay-leaf, half a pint of 
hot water, and half a teaspoonful of salt ; cover, and simmer until the 
moisture is reduced one-half, and add two tablespoonfuls of Maggi 
Bouillon, a pint of hot water and a gill of good sherry ; cover and 
simmer on back of range until the meat is very tender. Put it away 
to get cold and next day warm it up in a frying pan or chafing dish, 
add a little lemon or lime juice and serve.

Plain Mutton Ciirr 



1 



Cut up half a pound of cold boiled mutton in symmetrical pieces. 
Chop up an onion and fry it with three tablespoonfuls of Antonini 
Olive Oil or butter, add the meat, toss it about a few moments, strew 
over it a teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, and add half a 
pint of gravy ; simmer gently a few minutes and serve. This is 
about as simple a mode of preparing the dish as can be proposed ; 
it may be improved by frying a little apple with the onion and 
adding more water, then thickening it with browned flour. 

Raw mutton should be fried a little before it is added to the 
Curry sauce. Mutton chops may be curried the same as veal 
chops. 



62 



Curry of Lamb. 



The breast of lamb freed from fat makes a very good Curry. Cut 
up a pound of It and toss the pieces about in the frying pan a few 
moments. Sprinkle over the meat a teaspoonful of the J. P. Smith 
Curry Powder and a gill of vinegar ; cover, cook ten minutes and put 
the meat away to allow the Curry to permeate it. When wanted fry 
an onion brown, add to it half a pint of hot water, a tablespoonful of 
Maggi Bouillon and a little salt ; simmer ten minutes, strain and add 
the meat with a square of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of Chutney or 
Chili relish, or tomato catsup. If convenient add the grated fruit of 
half a fresh cocoanut. Simmer slowly an hour, serve with boiled rice 
and orange juice in a sauce-boat. 



63 



Curried Pork Tender lorn. 



Pound together in a mortar a clove of garlic, a tablespoonful of J. 
P. Smith's Curry Powder, a square of sugar, the juice of a lemon, and 
a saltspoonful of salt ; add a tablespoonful of Epicurean Sauce, and 
one of French mustard. Select a fresh pork tenderloin, cut it into 
three-inch pieces and cut gashes lengthwise all over the meat; into 
these gashes rub the paste. Put them into a pan, pour a little 
Antonini Olive Oil over each, and bake in the oven twenty minutes. 
Turn frequently while they are cooking. These are excellent cold. 



64 



Curried Eggs. 



Hard boil six eggs ; when cool enough, remove the shell and quarter 
them lengthwise. Put these on a hot platter, surround the pile with 
a good Curry sauce, garnish the border with boiled rice and serve. ^ 



65 



Curried Hamburg Steak. 



Ask the dealer for a pound of chopped lean meat; shape it into 
little cakes, over each cake rub a little Curry oil and a few drops of 
garlic oil, and fry or bake the steaks. Put them in the centre of a 
dish and pour over them a good strong Curry sauce and serve plain. 



66 



Curried Canned Beef. 



Make the Curry sauce in the usual manner, warm the sHces of the 
canned corned beef in it and serve. 



67 



Curried Plantain. 



Select the long green plantains that find their way here from 
Cuba, peel them and boil them forty minutes. Put them on a hot 
platter, cover them with Curry sauce, squeeze the juice of an orange 
over them and serve. 



68 



Vegetable Curries. 



Cold boiled vegetables as well as the fresh vegetables are all ex- 
cellent served as Curries. They are cooked with butter and seasoned 
with Curry Powder, or warmed in the Curry sauce. A list of vege- 
table Curries would alone fill a large volume. 

In a very rare old Hindoo cookery book I possess are recipes for 
Curries of all kinds of grain, fruits, vegetables, roots, greens, flowers, 
seeds, etc., that would simply astound New Yorkers. We, however, 
could not prepare, much less eat their dishes as per recipe any more 
than the Hindoo would eat our Curries. They have a different Curry 
preparation for each different article.

Curried Macaroni. 



Break into three pieces, each tube of a half a pound of Geofifroy 
Taganrok Macaroni, which is the best in the market. Put it into a 
porcelain lined dish or saucepan, cover with boiling water, add a 
scant teaspoonful of table salt and boil fifteen minutes ; drain, 
place the Macaroni on a hot platter, cover it with a Curry sauce 
made of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, over this strew a liberal quantity 
of (J. P. S.) Italien Parmasan Cheese and serve.

Curried Macaroni, JVo. 2. 



Procure from the Italian grocer a tomato paste called Pompodoro. 
Put into a saucepan an ounce of butter, whisk it as it melts and add 
two ounces of the tomato paste ; keep stirring, and add a tablespoon- 
ful of Maggi Bouillon, a teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, 
and a pint of water ; stir to prevent burning and set on back of 
range until wanted. Boil half a pound of Barton Macaroni fifteen 
minutes, when done drain, put it on a hot platter and pour the sauce 
over it. Serve J. P. Smith's Italien Parmasan Cheese separately 
with it.

heaping tablespoonful of table butter; spread tliis over thin shoes of 
bread, and between the shces place thin slices of cold roast or boiled 
meat, poultry, etc. 



74 



Deviled Chicken Le^s. 

o 



Make a Curry paste the same as for Curried veal chops. Make 
deep incisions in the legs of two chickens and into the incisions 
rub the paste, and broil until well done. Cold roast or boiled legs 
may be similarly treated but only need to be sauteed in a pan with 
a little Antonini Olive Oil. 



75 



Deviled Bones, 



Rub two ribs of cold roast beef with Curry paste and broil them 
enough to heat the meat through.
