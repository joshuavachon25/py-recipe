TO OUR PATRONS 



In adding this little hrochure to the world of literature we aim to 
supply what we believe to be a real want ; that is, a simple, economical, 
labor-saving method of cookery, at a price suited to the hard times. It 
contains over one hundred original receipts, all of which we can confi- 
dently recommend, having used them with good results for many years. 
As this effort is intended chiefly for the use of young house-keepers and 
small families generally, the receipts are given in small quantities for 
better convenience. The directions for preparing and cooking the differ- 
ent dishes are given as clearly and concisely as possible, and we have 
endeavored as far as can be, to combine economy with luxury. That 
the use of the " Pet " may warrant its title and provp a help in time 
of need to all into whose hands it may chance to fall, is the sincere 
desire of The Author. 



BUE^D 



Family Bread. 

As bread is an indispensable article of food it is desirable to have it 
uniformly light and sweet. The first thing to be done is to purchase the 
best flour. There is no economy in buying an inferior article at less 
price, for the difference in price will be more than balanced by waste. 
For an ordinary sized loaf of family bread, it will require about four 
cups of flour. Melt a piece of butter or lard about the size of a walnut 
in a cup of warm water, pour it into your dough pan, add a tea-spoonful 
of salt, a third of a cup of liquid yeast, or half a cake of Gaff & Fleisch- 
mann's Compressed yeast, which we recommend as the best yeast we have 
ever known, and first stir in a little flour and beat it a minute or two as 
you would beat an egg. Then add the remainder of the flour and mix 
with warm water (always using water that has been boiled) sutRcient to 
make a stiff dough. 

One cup of water to two of flour is about the quantity, but the rule 
cannot be given exact. It should not be so dry as to make it difficult to 
knead, but as stiff as it can well be stirred with a spoon. This small 
quantity may be mixed with a sharp edged spoon without putting the 
hands into it if preferred. Lay a plate, face down on the dough and 
cover the dish with a folded cloth. Set it in a warm place (a closet near 
a chimney where a fire is kept during the day is usually of the right 
temperature in cold weather) and let it rise over night. When it is risen 
take it out on to the kneading-board and knead it ten minutes, using as little 
flour as possible. Make it into a smooth roll and place it in a buttered pan 
and set it again in a warm j)lace, over the stove if convenient, but not where 
it will get hot, and let it rise to nearly double the size before baking. 
The oven should be hot enough to brown the top slightly within fifteen 
minutes. If it browns too fast at first the heat must be subdued a little 
by leaving one of the oven doors ajar, or by some other arrangement, as 
the loaf should remain in the oven nearly or quite an hour. It usually 
bakes best on the bottom of the oven. If the yeast is not perfectly 

5 



b THE PET COOK BOOK. 

sweet, and the dough should taste sour after rising, dissolve from a half 
to a tea-spoonful of soda in a very little water and knead it well in. A 
baking pan six inches by ten is a proper size for this loaf, and it should 
be of sheet iron or tin that has been used. New, bright tin is not as 
good for baking purposes. Some practice and a good deal of care is 
needed in order to insure perfect success. If the dough rises too long 
the second time it will be too spongy, if not long enough it will not be 
light. It should rise one-half after it is put in the oven to be just right. 
We will add in this connection that for all the receipts given in this 
book a coffee cup that holds half a pint is used for a measure. 

Cream of Tartar Biscuit. 

To two cups of flour add half a tea-spoonful of salt, and mix well into 
the flour a tea-spoonful of Cream of Tartar. Dissolve half a tea-spoon- 
ful of Soda in a cup of milk, and mix quickly, stirring with a spoon. If 
the cup of milk is not sufficient add a little more gradually until you have 
a dough a little softer than for family bread. Dredge your board with 
flour, turn out your dough and roll to the thickness of three-fourths of 
an inch, cut with a biscuit cutter, and bake in a quick oven fifteen min- 
utes. We give here as a universal rule that whenever Cream of Tartar 
is used in anything, it should be mixed in the flour, and the Soda dissolved 
in the milk or water. Soda and salasratus are alike. Common baking 
powder, which is composed of the same ingredients, may be used instead 
if preferred, always mixed in the dry flour. 

Breakfast Rolls. 

To two cups of flour rub in a piece of butter the size of an ^gg. Add 
half a tea-spoonful of salt, one-quarter of a cup of yeast, or a quarter of 
a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in a little water, and mix with luke- 
warm water a little softer than for family bread. Cover and rise it over 
night as previously directed. After it is risen do not knead it at all, but 
roll and cut same as /or Cream of Tartar biscuit. Then dip the end of 
a knife or spoon in a little melted butter, pass it over each biscuit, and 
fold it over double. Place them a little distance apart in the pan, lay a 
cloth over the whole, and stand it where it is quite warm for ten or fifteen 
minutes, and bake the same as biscuit. The addition of a little sugar in 
bread is thought by some to be an improvement. The quantity, about a 
table-spoonful to four cups of flour. 



BREAD. 7 

Graham Biscuit, 

Take one-half Graham and one-half white flour, and mix it well to- 
gether. To each cup of flour add a table-spoonful of brown sugar, a 
little salt, and mix with milk. Soda, and Cream of Tartar, same as for 
Cream of Tartar biscuit. It may be made in loaves the same way, or 
raised with yeast like family bread. 

Corn Bread. 

Half a cup of bolted Indian meal and a cup of flour mixed. Beat one 
egg with three table-spoonsful of sugar, mix one tea-spoonful of Cream 
of Tartar into the meal, and dissolve half a tea-spoonful of Soda in a 
cup of milk. Add half a tea-spoonful of salt, mix all together and pour 
into a shallow pan and bake fifteen or twenty minutes, or until it is a 
rich brown. It may be made without sugar if preferred, or with sour 
milk, omitting the Cream of Tartar, and using a tea-spoonful of Soda to 
each cup of sour milk. 

Short Cake. 

Take two cups of flour, rub into one-half of it one-third of a cup of 
butter, and in the other half mix a tea-spoonful of Cream of Tartar and 
half a tea-spoonful of salt. Stir the whole together, then dissolve half a 
tea-spoonful of soda in a cup of milk, mix and roll into a sheet about an 
inch thick, and bake twenty minutes to half an hour. This is very nice 
for plain bread. For strawberry or blackberry short cake, slice it through 
the centre while it is hot, spread on butter, and put in layers of berries 
and sugar. 

Brown Bread. 

Two cups Indian meal, two of rye, one-half a cup of molasses, one-half 
a cup or one-half a cake of yeast, stir in warm water to make a soft 
dough, rise one hour, and bake or steam three hours. 

Muffins. 

Make the same as breakfast rolls except use more water and make the 
dough quite soft. Rise over night and in the morning do not stir or knead 
it at all. Bake in a French Roll pan, or rings, and drop a spoonful in each. 
Let it stand ten or fifteen minutes before baking and bake ten minutes. 



8 THE PET COOK BOOK. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

A cup and a half of Buckwheat to two cups warm water, a table- 
spoonful of molasses, half a tea-spoonful salt, quarter of a cake of com- 
pressed yeast. Rise over night and fry with lard. The most successful 
way is to reserve a little of the dough to rise from each day and add a 
little soda in the morning instead of using yeast every time. 

Milk Toast. 

To one quart of boiling milk add two table-spoonfuls of flour wet in a 
little cold milk. Let it boil five minutes. Take it from the fire and stir 
in half a cup of butter, and salt to taste. Have your bread cut thin and 
toasted brown, dip each slice in the milk and lay it on the dish, then pour 
the remainder over the whole. Do not boil it after the butter is added. 
A smooth iron pan is best to make it in, as the milk is not so liable to 
burn as in tin or other ware. 

Batter Cakes. 

Three well beaten eggs to one pint of milk, and one cup of flour. Add 
salt, soda and Cream of Tartar in the usual way, and fry on the griddle 
with butter. Serve with butter and sugar. This receipt with one-quarter 
rye meal and three-quarters flour and a tabl^spoonful of sugar makes 
nice griddle cakes for variety. 

Flannel Cakes. 

Take a pint of warm water, a tea-spoonful of salt, and a quarter of a 
cake of compressed yeast, and add sifted flour to make a batter of the 
same consistency as for batter cakes. Rise over night and fry on the 
griddle in butter. Serve with butter and sugar, or syrup. 



MEATS. 



ME A.TS. 



Roast Beef. 



Five or six pounds of beef is as small a piece as will make a good 
roast, and, to be rare^ should not be cooked more than an hour and a 
half. Dredge it lightly with flour and place it on a wire grate in the 
centre of your dripping pan, and have the oven hotter than is required 
for bread or pastry, and baste often. Make a gravy of two table-spoon- 
fuls of browned flour and a pint of hot water, and pour into the pan. 
Use that to baste with, and as it boils away add more hot water. No 
salt should be used at first, but when it is nearly done scatter a table- 
spoonful over it, on all sides, and continue to baste often. There should 
be just enough salt used to make the gravy palatable, and water enough 
to make it of the right consistency when ready to serve. It is convenient 
to have a quantity of browned flour on hand. The best way to make it 
is to take a small sieve and scatter the flour evenly over a shallow pan 
to the depth of a quarter of an inch, and place it in the oven, watching 
it closely so that no part of it will get burnt. A rich tan brown is the 
proper color. The meat should be turned two or three times while roast- 
ing. Serve with cranberry sauce or currant jelly, mashed potatoes, tur- 
nips, squash, onions, celery, cold slaw, or the vegetables of the season. 
In preparing meat to cook, if it is necessary, it may be rinsed or wiped 
with a wet cloth ; but sliced meat should never be washed. 

Broiled Beef Steak. 

Cut the steak about an inch in thickness if you 'like it rare, and broil 
it over a quick fire until it is browned on both sides. It should be turned 
often while broiling to prevent burning and save the juice. Use a wire 
grating. Grooved gridirons, recommended to save the gravy, should never 
be used ; for the gravy or juice of the meat should not be allowed to 
escape the meat until after it is dished. Season with salt and pepper 
after it is done, and lay your butter cold on the steak, set it in the oven 
a minute or two until it is melted. Butter for a^sauce or gravy should 
never be let to boil or simmer. 



10 THE PET COOK BOOK. 

Mutton Chops, Veal, Pork, 

and other meats requiring to be broiled, may be done the same as beef 
steak, but not cut quite as thick. 

Koast Turkey. 

When dressed and ready to prepare for the oven, singe off the hairs 
with a blazing paper. Turn the wings and neck back and fasten them 
together with a skewer or string. Tie the legs and fasten them close to 
the body, stuff the crop, rub salt all over, dredge with flour, have a grate 
in the oven pan to keep the turkey about an inch above the gravy, and 
roast from two to three hours, according to the size. Make a gravy of 
browned flour and turn and baste often. For a dressing, soak half a 
dozen soft crackers, or the same quantity of bread, squeeze all the water 
out, add one egg, a small piece of butter, a table-spoonful of sweet mar- 
joram, and pepper and salt to taste. Boil the giblets one and a half 
hours, chop and add to the gravy. 

Koast Chicken. 

Prepare the same as for roast turkey except that most of the dressing 
must be put in the body, as the crop will hold but a little. Roast one 
hour and a half. For fowls that are a year old or more, a surer way to 
have them tender is to prepare them for the oven, then steam them one 
hour before roasting. One hour will be sufficient time to roast. Boil 
the giblets one hour, chop and add them to the gravy. 

Koast Veal. 

The upper part of the thigh makes the best veal roast. Take the bone 
out of the centre and fill its place with dressing, and roast the same as 
beef, except that it needs to be cooked an hQur longer. 

Corned Beef. 

Five pounds of beef will require three hours boiling. Put it in boiling 
water and keep it boiling steadily. The cabbage is best boiled with the 
meat. Cut it in halves and tie it up in a bag or net. It will boil in an 
hour and a half if it is not extra large. Other vegetables may be boiled 
with the meat or separately, except turnips. Those should always be 
boiled in fresh water. 



MEATS. 11 

Fricasseed Chicken. 

Boil the chicken whole until tender. Then take all the meat from the 
bones, slice and place it in the frying pan with a little butter, dredge on 
a little flour and brown it on both sides. Then take it from the pan, 
make a gravy of browned flour and milk, boil it for five minutes, season 
with salt and pepper, and pour it over the chicken and serve immediately. 

Boiled Tongue. 

Have the water boiling hot when it is put in, boil three or four hours, 
according to size, or until you can run a fork through it easily. Peel off 
the skin while it is hot. 

Beef smotliered in Onions. 

Slice and fry half a dozen onions with a few slices of salt pork, put a 
layer of onions and a layer of beef steak, then another layer of onions 
on top. Dredge a little flour over each layer, add salt and pepper, and 
a cup of water. Stew slowly half an hour and add water enough for a 
gravy if it dries away. 

Pigs' Feet. 

The nicest way to cook pigs' feet is to dredge with flour and brown 
them in butter. If you wish a gravy make it the same as for fricasseed 
chicken. 

Tripe. 

The same as pigs' feet, or in crumbs, or batter. 

Fried Sausages. 

To fry sausages no fat is required as they contain enough to cook 
them. Turn them often and cook slowly till they are brown on all sides. 
If cooked too quick they will burst open. 

Liver. 

Liver should be cut about half an inch in thickness and cooked more 
thoroughly than any other meat. The best way is to broil it on a grid- 
iron and dress the same as beef steak. 



12 THE PET COOK BOOK. 

Ham and Eggs. 

To fry ham, have the pan very hot, brown the ham on both sides and 
take it out of the fat. It should not be cooked so long as to make it dry 
and hard. Drain off the fat, pour a spoonful or two of hot water into 
the pan and stir up the salt from the bottom and turn it on to your dish 
for a gravy if you choose. Then turn back the fat and add more if 
necessary to fry the eggs in. Break in each egg separately, and turn 
when half done, or throw the boiling fat over while cooking and not 
disturb them till they are done. 

Lyonese Potatoes. 

Slice three onions and fry them with a slice or two of salt pork until 
they are tender. Slice three or four boiled potatoes and fry all together 
until the potatoes are brown, then drain off all the fat and serve hot. 

Boiled Eggs. 

Drop eggg into boiling water and boil two and a half minutes, if you 
wish them to be soft. If middling hard, boil three minutes. 

Dropped Eggs. 

Break the shells, drop the eggs in boiling water and boil two minutes. 
Serve with buttered toast. 

Omelet. 

Break not more than two eggs at a time, and stir a little, but not beat 
them. Add a little salt and pepper, put a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut into a heated pan and pour the eggs in and spread them all over 
the pan. Then with a spoon throw them over and over quickly, roll up 
and turn out on to a warm dish. One minute is long enough for them 
to cook. Kepeat the process if you wish to use more eggs, cooking but 
two at a time. 

Poached Eggs. 

The. same, as for omelet, except that the eggs are beaten before cooking 
and broken up in the pan. Any number may be used at a time in this 
way. _Add..a spo,o.nful of milk to each egg. 



MEATS. 13 

Baked Beans. 

Take two cups of pea beans for a three quart bean pot, half a pound 
of salt pork, scalded and scored, a table-spoonful of molasses, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt if the pork is part lean, if not, more salt will be required. 
Fill the pot with water if they are to be baked over night, but if they 
are baked during the day it is better to put in less water at first and add 
as it is necessary. Many persons boil the beans and change the water 
before baking, by which means much of the flavor is lost. By our 
method they will need to be baked longer, but the flavor will be richer. 

Salt Fish. 

Cut salt fish in square pieces and boil half an hour, then take it out, 
peel off the skin and take out the bones. Put it on to boil again in 
fresh water, enough to cover it, and let it boil an hour longer. Boil 
potatoes at the same time, and beets if you choose. Serve with butter 
sauce. If any is left it may be made into fish balls for breakfast the 
next morning. 

Fish Balls. 

Take boiled salt fish and boiled potatoes, chop fine, and mix equal 
parts of each, and moisten it with butter sauce, and mold it into cakes 
or balls with flour, and brown them in lard or pork fat. If you have no 
butter sauce use the same ingredients that it is made of. Dredge a little 
flour over the mixture, stir in a little melted butter and add cream or 
milk enough to make it hold together. Use flour for molding. 

Fried Fish. 

Fresh Halibut, Cod, Blue Fish, or other fish of the kind, may be fried 
in salt pork fat or lard, using Indian meal for dredging, or broiled and 
dressed the same as steak. Smelts and Trout are best fried in butter. 

Fish Chowder. 

Take three pounds of fresh Cod, take off the skin, fry three onions in 
a slice of pork cut in small pieces, pare and slice three potatoes, put m a 
layer of each, pour over two quarts of boiling water, and boil half an 
hour. Split four water crackers and cover them with cold water for ten 
minutes. Drain the water off and put them into the chowder when it is 
nearly done. When quite done pour in half a pint of milk, a^d salt and 
pepper to taste and serve hot. 



14 THE PET COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Fresh Salmon. 

Boil half an hour, put a little salt in the water. Serve with caper sauce. 

Boiled Clams. 

Get clams in the shell if possible. Rinse each one separately, or wipe 
the shells with a wet cloth. Shell fish should never be put into water as 
it will freshen them. The salt which they contain is indispensable to 
their flavor. Fill your pot with clams and pour over them half a pint of 
water, hot or cold, cover tight, and boil until the shells open, which will 
be in from ten to twenty minutes. Then take them out with a skimmer. 
Drain off the water for use and keep it hot. The sand will all settle at 
the bottom. Take the clams from the shells, cut off the black snouts, 
take a portion of the liquor and rinse each one separately, holding on to 
the snout and washing the sand from the under side of it. Then add 
enough of the liquor which you have hot to cover them and season with 
butter and pepper. 

Clam Chowder. 

Boil the clams as by previous direction. Use all the liquor for the 
chowder and make it the same as fish chowder, only not put in the clams 
until the chowder is done, as they will need no more boiling. Some 
prefer it without the milk. 

Lobster Salad. 

Have equal parts of chopped lobst and lettuce. Serve with salad 
dressing. 

Chicken Salad. 

Equal parts of boiled chicken and celery chopped. Use the same 
dressing as for lobster salad with the addition of a spoonful of olive oil 
and the yolk of an egg. 

Stewed Chicken. 

Cut the joints apart, divide the carcase, and put it on to stew with just 
water enough to cover it. Add a couple of slices of salt pork, cut in 
small squares, a little salt and pepper, and let it cook slowly until the 
chicken is quite tender. It will take from an hour and a half to two 
hours, according to the age of the fowl. Then pare jjotatoes and lay 
them, whole, around the edge of the kettle, cover light, and cook until 



MEATS. 15 

they are nearly done, adding water if necessary, so as to have just enough 
for gravy when it is done, then make dumplings same as for Cream of 
Tartar biscuit, cut the size of a walnut, lay them on or around the pota- 
toes, coveTr tight, and steam fifteen minutes. Thicken the gravy with 
browned flour, and season with salt and pepper. Beef, veal, or birds, 
make a nice dish cooked in the same way. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Take five or six pounds of meat and bone from the shank of beef and 
boil it in four quarts of water four or five hours, then add half a cabbage, 
one French turnip, two carrots, chopped, and *boil one hour longer. 
Lastly, add two or three sliced potatoes and dumplings, made same as 
for chicken stew and cut about the size of a walnut. Drop them in while 
the soup is boiling, and boil fifteen minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. 

Bone Soup. 

A light soup may be made of the carcase of a roast turkey or chicken, 
or the bones of roast beef. Boil the bones in two quarts of water two 
hours, then take them out, cut all the meat from them and return it to 
the soup, and add one sliced potato, a table-spoonful of rice, and one 
onion. Boil half an hour longer and season with salt and pepper. 

Butter Sauce. 

Boil a pint of milk and stir into it a table-spoonful of flour wet with 
a little cold milk, and let it boil five minutes. Add half a cup of butter 
and salt to taste. It should not boil after the butter is put in. 

Caper Sauce. 

The same as butter sauce, with the addition of a few spoonfuls of capers. 

Egg Sauce. 

The same as butter sauce, with the addition of two hard boiled eggs 
chopped fine. 

Boiled Turkey. 

Dress a turkey same as for roast, boil three hours and serve with oyster 
sauce. Put the oysters on in the liquor, let them simmer until they are 
shrunken, then thicken the liquor with flour or pounded crackers. Add 
butter, pepper and salt. 



16 THE PET COOK BOOK. 

Stewed Oysters. 

Put no water with the oysters unless they are too salt. Boil five 
minutes, add a cup of milk to a quart of oysters, let it come to a boiling 
heat, then take it from the fire and add butter, pepper and salt. 

Scalloped Oysters. 

Put layers of oysters and pounded crackers with butter and seasoning 
in a baking dish, and bake until they are brown on the top. An easier 
way is to scald your oysters until they are separated from the liquor, 
then add six pounded crackers, and a piece of butter the size of an egg 
to each quart, season to taste, boil and stir three minutes, and serve. 

Oysters fried in batter. 

Make a batter same as for griddle cakes, scald your oysters until they 
are separated from the water, drain them, and stir them into the batter. 
Drop a spoonful at a time on to a buttered griddle and serve hot. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Boil six or eight good sized potatoes half an hour, or until you can 
run a fork through them easily. Peal and mash fine with a pestle or 
spoon, add a tea-spoonful of salt, butter the size of an egg, two or three 
spoonfuls of cream, and stir until it is white and smooth. Set it in the 
oven to brown on top or not as you please. 

String Beans. 

If they are young and tender they will boil in two hours. They should 
not be boiled with salt beef, but a small piece of pork gives them a nice 
relish. Add salt and butter after they are dished. 

Asparagus. 

Boil twenty minutes in just water enough to cover it. Add salt and 
butter when dished. Green Peas the same. 

Green Corn. 
Drop the ears into boiling water and boil twenty minutes. No salt. 

Squash. 

Summer squash requires about an hour to boil. The marrow squash 
a little less time. Season both with salt, butter, and pepper. 



riKS. ■ 17 

Turnips. 

The small round turnip should boil in less than an hour, the white 
French turnip in one and a half hours, and the yellow in two hours. 
Season the same as squash. 

Green Peas. 

Boil twenty minutes, and season with butter and salt. 

Raw Potatoes Pried. 

Pare and slice them as thin as a knife blade, drop them singly into 
boiling fat. Fry till brown, skim them out, sprinkle on salt. 



PIES 



Pastry. 

For each pie allow a cup of flour and a quarter of a cup of butter, or 
lard, or equal quantities of each. Rub the butter or lard well into the 
flour and mix with cold water. Make the dough quite stiff. If it is too 
soft it will be tough. Take half the dough for under crust, roll to the 
thickness of one eighth of an inch and cover your plates, having them 
well buttered. Then take the remainder of the dough, roll it out all at 
once to the same thickness and spread over it half a cup of hard butter. 
Fold it several times over, and, if the weather is warm, lay it on the ice 
for an hour or tw6. In cold weather it may be rolled immediately. Do 
not fill your pies until you are ready to bake them, then roll same as the 
under crust and cover them. To prevent the juice from escaping in the 
oven, before laying on the cover, dip the tips of the fingers in cold water 
and moisten the edge of the under crust, then lay on the cover and 
press hard all round with the ends of the fingers, before trimming the 
edge off. Finish by laying a strip of pastry around the edge. Pies 
should be baked on the bottom of the oven from a half to three-quarters 
of an hour. 



18 * THE PET COOK BOOK. 

Mince Pies. 

Take four pounds of fresh beef, having about one-quarter of it fat. 
Boil until tender, and chop fine. Add an equal quantity of chopped sour 
apples, one pound of chopped raisins, a table-spoonful of allspice, a tea- 
spoonful of clove, same of cinnamon, half a nutmeg, a cup and a half of 
molasses, same of cider vinegar, same of sugar, two tea-spoonfuls salt, 
and as much of the liquor that the meat was boiled in (using all the fat 
from the top) as is required for the mixture. It should be wet enough 
so that when you make a hole in the centre the liquor will stand in it, 
and if there should not be fat enough on the meat make up the deficiency 
in melted butter. If you do not wish to bake it all at a time, the mince 
will keep in a cool i:)lace three or four days. Heat it scalding hot and 
it will keep two weeks. 

Sliced Apple Pies. 

Slice your apples quite thin, pour water over them and drain it off 
immediately. Fill your plates about an inch deep while they are wet, 
scatter over three table-spoonfuls sugar, and flavor with cinnamon, nut- 
meg, or lemon. Bake half an hour. Pies should always be baked on 
the bottom of the oven. 

Squash Pies. 

Boil your squash the same as for the table. When cool run it through 
a colander or sieve. If you use a deep plate for baking, allow one and 
a half cups of sifted squash, two eggs, and one cup of milk to a pie. 
Add sugar and spice to taste. A little ginger, with no other spice, makes 
a nice flavor for squash. Bake until it is firm in the centre. 

Berry Pies. 

For blueberry, raspberry, cherry, or other berry . pies, line a deep 
plate, fill it with berries, scatter over two-thirds of a cup of sugar, cover 
and bake half an hour. Use no spice in berry pies. 

Rhubarb Pies. 

Peal the skins from the stalks and cut them in small pieces. Allow a 
quart for a deep plate, and before using, dissolve a tea-spoonful of soda 
in a quart of water, pour it over the rhubarb, and let it stand a few 
minutes. Then drain off, rinse in cold water, and fill your pies as with 
other fruit. Add one cup of sugar, cover, and bake half an hour. 



PIES. 19 

Custard Pie. 

Four eggs, one pint of new milk, sugar and spice to taste. Beat the 
eggs but a very little, and take it out of the oven the moment it is firm 
in the center. Flavor with nutmeg. Many prefer custard without spice. 

Washington Pie. 

For one pie, use one-half a cup of sugar, on^quarter cup of butter, 
one-third of a cup of milk, three-fourths of a cup of flour, and one egg. 
Bake in two tin pie plates, ten minutes, and when cool, put between them
