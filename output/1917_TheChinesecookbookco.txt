PREFACE 

Some one once said that without a good 
cook and good cooking life was not worth 
living. 

The author's purpose is to make good cook- 
ing possible. 

All these recipes have been tested and are 
therefore reliable. 

A person who has tasted Chinese food real- 
izes that it is the most palatable and delicious 
cooking he ever ate. It is not only that but its 
nutritious value recommends it to all. It is 
true in a sense that we eat to live. If the body 
does not have nutritious and pleasant food no 
full growth and development is possible; hence 
power is weakened. 

Leave the decision as to Chinese cooking to 
your own taste. When you have eaten the 
food you will soon be convinced not only 
of its merits but, in fact, of its superior- 
ity over other kinds of food and ways of 
cooking. 



PREFACE 



This book is meant not only for the house- 
wife but also for the restaurateur. In fact, it 
is written in such a clear, simple form that any 
one by following its rules can prepare dishes 
of rare delicacy and flavor. 

This is my purpose in writing the book. I 
wish to make good, tempting, and wholesome 
cooking possible for all. 

Shiu Wong Chan.

THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 



THE HISTORY OF CHINESE 
COOKING 

In ancient times stoves were very different 
from now; hence cooking was crude and less 
elaborate. The food was broiled over coals or 
buried in hot ashes. The portable stoves of 
Pompeii which were dug up during the uncov- 
ering of the buried city show how these stoves 
were made. Others were the oven fireplace, 
the brick oven, and the Franklin stove invented 
by Benjamin Franklin. The cook-stoves 
adapted to wood were very different from the 
gas and electrical appliances of to-day. 

It was but a step for primitive man, from 
baking in hot ashes, or in a covered kettle set 
on coals, to a simple form of oven. Often one 
served a community. Sometimes a fire was 
built directly in the oven, and when it was 
burned down the oven was swept out and the 
food put in to be cooked by the heated bricks. 
The later brick oven, still used in some old 
houses, had a space underneath for a separate 



2 THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 

fire. Charcoal was the primitive form of fuel 
used in some countries, especially in those hav- 
ing a mild climate. 

This difference between the stoves of long 
ago and now has helped to improve our cook- 
ing. 

The Chinese method of cooking was invented 
by the Emperor of Pow Hay Se in the year 
3000 B.C. Confucius, the great philosopher, 
taught how to eat scientifically. The propor- 
tion of meat should not be more than that of 
vegetable. There ought to be a little finger in 
one's food. Confucius would not eat anything 
which was not chopped up properly. To-day, 
unconsciously, the Chinese people are obeying 
this same law. 

It is this scientific custom which makes Chi- 
nesefoodparticularlynourishing and beneficial. 

In ancient days the Chinese used knives and 
forks. Later, they found that sometimes these 
impaired the delicious flavor of the food; hence 
their use of chop-sticks and spoons. 

China has always been noted for its cooking- 
Many Americans prefer Chinese cooking. In 
fact, many Americans have Chinese cooks in 
their kitchens. After having tasted Chinese 



THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 3 

food, one realizes how delicious it is. It 
has been said that if the Chinese were as great 
in other ways as in cooking ability they would 
notably influence other nations. 

The story is told of a young Chinese couple 
newly married. The bridegroom was boasting 
to a friend of his bride's ability in cooking. 
The friend was invited to visit the groom's 
home. The friend had a keen sense of humor 
and so he asked the groom if his bride would 
cook anything he brought. The groom, feel- 
ing confident of his wife's ability, told his 
friend that he might bring anything he wished 
and the bride would cook it. 

The friend came, bringing with him a stalk 
of sugar-cane and a pound of pork. He gave 
it to the bride. Now, the friend of course 
thought it would be impossible for the bride to 
do anything with these things. But he had not 
taken into consideration her cleverness. 

The bride took the cane and, with a scraper, 
removed the outside rind. Then she put the 
pound of pork, cut into pieces, and the remain- 
ing cane through a grinder. To this chopped 
cane she added the white of an egg, and, using 
a little cornstarch, mixed all well together. 



4 THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 

Then she made balls. She fried these balls in 
oil and proudly set them before their guest, 
who was astonished at their delicious flavor 
and tastiness. 

This story simply shows the magic of Chi- 
nese cooking. Often very tasty and wonderful 
dishes are made out of unexpected and unusual 
things. The result is not only savory and ap- 
petizing ; it creates a desire for more. 

Even the inexperienced housewife can pre- 
pare Chinese dishes of great flavor and deli- 
cacy.

GENERAL LAWS OF CHINESE 
COOKING 

A Chinese dish consists of three parts: (a) 
meat; (b) secondary vegetables, such as Chi- 
nese water chestnut, bamboo shoot, celery, Chi- 
nese mushroom, and sometimes other vege- 
tables according to the season; (c) the garnish 
on the top of each dish, consisting of Chinese 
ham, chicken, or roast pork cut up into small 
dice or into small bars about one inch long, and 
enough parsley to aid the taste as well as to 
ornament the dish. 

The amount of meat, in accordance with the 
hygienic law of Confucius, is about one-third 
that of the secondary vegetables. 

The meat should be the same size and shape 
as the vegetables and must be uniform. It may 
be cut into dice, into bars, or into fragments ; 
judgment must be used as to this when the size 
of the vegetable is limited. 

There are three methods employed in Chi- 
nese cooking; steaming, frying, and boiling. 

B 



6 THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 

In steaming always drain off any water or 
other liquid substance and add just enough 
primary soup to cover the material. Steam 
until just soft, for in that state the food has 
its most delicious taste* Before eating pour 
off the primary soup, take off all oil on the 
surface, and put into the steamer again for 
a few moments. Salt to suit the taste. 

In steaming, a hot fire should be used. 

In boiling, the fire should be only sufficiently 
hot to keep the food at the boiling-point. 

Frying should be done over a very hot fire, 
and the food should be turned constantly with 
a cooking-shovel, so that every particle will re- 
ceive the same amount of heat. 

MARKETING 

In addition to the meat and ordinary vege- 
tables, there are articles used in Chinese cook- 
ing which are to be found only in Chinese gro- 
cery stores. A list of these stores is given on 
page 198. 

In ordering by mail, write not only the 
American or Chinese name of the article, but 
copy (or trace on thin paper) the Chinese sign

mate cost, in the list beginning on page 199. 

As the prices can be given only approxi- 
mately, enclose with your letter a check or

PRELIMINARY RECIPES 

Since this is a foreign cook book, it is desir- 
able to have the recipes for all the fundamen- 
tals, such as sauces, etc., at the beginning of 
the book. They not only are nutritious and 
healthful but are so delicious that they add 
much to the flavor and delicacy of the foods 
with which they are combined. As they are 
used in practically every dish, a thorough 
knowledge of how to make them is a necessity. 

PRIMARY SOUP 

SUNG TONG 

One may wonder why a dish cooked in a 
restaurant is better than one cooked at home. 
It is true that a better cook may have some 
effect on the dish, but the real secret is the 
primary soup which the cook uses for gravy 

8 



THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 9 

and for the final cooking instead of using 
water. 

This soup is always made of equal weights 
of chicken and lean pork: say % pound of 
each, for each pint of water. It is advisable to 
use not less than 6 pints of water, and meat in 
proportion. 

The quality of a dish depends upon the na- 
ture of this primary soup. 

(a) Chop the meat into small pieces. 

(&) Cook slowlj- for 2^ hours, or until 
about half of the liquid has evaporated. 

In order to do away with any oil which may 
exist, put into the mixture a bowl of chicken 
blood. 

(c) Strain through a thick cloth until the 
liquid is as clear as water. Should there be 
any oil remaining on top, skim it off. 

Let the soup cool. Keep in the refrigerator 
to be used as needed.

CHINESE SAUCE 

SEE YOUT 

Boil Chinese white beans slowly for 6 hours. 
Strain off the beans and expose the bean soup 
in a big pot placed under the hot sun. The 
surface of the liquid turns brown and has a 
top layer. Remove this layer of brown. A 
little later take off the other layers, and so on 
until there is no brown layer. Add salt to 
this, and boiL 

This is called See Yout, meaning sauce. It 
can be bought, ready prepared, in any Chinese 
grocery store. 



THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 11 



CHINESE GRAVY 



HIN TOUT 

1 cup primary soup 
1 teaspoonful cornstarch 
% teaspoonful Chinese sauce 
Salt, sugar, and a few drops of sesamum- 
seed oil 

Mix the cornstarch well in a little cold water ; 
then stir into the boiling primary soup, and let 
boil until it thickens. Add the Chinese sauce, 
salt, sugar, and sesamum-seed oil, and stir well. 



12 THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 



SESAMUM-SEED OIL 



MAR YOUT 

Sesamum-seed has the strongest and most 
delicious oil of any seed. A few drops of this 
oil will improve a dish greatly. 

(a) Roast the seeds in a dry pan with a low 
fire till they turn brown. 

(b) Grind them with ^ stone grinder, and 
collect in a pan. 

(c) Take off the oil on top. This is sesa- 
mum-seed oil. 



THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 1.0 

PEANUT OIL 

^ m 

SANG YOUT 

Instead of using butter, the Chinese use pea- 
nut oil. Therefore in this book the word "oil" 
means peanut oil unless otherwise stated. 

Peanut oil is made as follows: 

(a) Skin the peanuts. 

(&) Fry them. Turn frequently until they 
are yellow. 

(c) Place them in a hollowed bloqk of thick 
wood which has a hole in one end. There are 
smaller holes through which the oil comes when 
the peanuts are crushed by a stick of wood in 
the large hole. 



14. THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 



CHICKEN STAKCH 



GUY YOUNG 

2 breasts of chickens 
1 cup primary soup 
1 teaspoonful cornstarch 
White of one egg 

(a) Pound the chicken, without skin and 
bone, as fine as possible. It is best when 
pounded with a hammer on a chopping-board. 

(b) Add the soup, cornstarch, and white of 
egg. Stir well. 

In using chicken starch, never pour it into 
the substance without first removing the pan 
from the fire. Keep stirring. Take off the 
fire the minute it begins to boil. The taste is 
bad if it boils too long. 



THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 15 

CHINESE WHITE CHEESE 

FOO YUE . 

(a) Cut bean cake, made of Chinese white 
beans, into half^inch squares % inch thick. 

(&) Put into a jar provided with an air- 
tight cover, the size of the jar depending upon 
the amount to be made. 

(c) Fill the jar 1/4 full of Fun Wine. 

(d) Salt to taste. 

(e) Cover air-tight, and put away for not 
less than two weeks. 



lU THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 

CHINESE RED CHEESE 

m fL 

NOUM YUE 

For this the bean cake is made of Chinese 
red beans. 

(a) Wrap up the cakes in a piece of cloth 
in any desired size. Fut pressure on top for 
5 days. 

(&) Take off the weight. Then the cloth. 
Scrape off the mold on top. 

(c) Place in a jar. Fill the jar 1/4 full 
of Fun Wine, and add plenty of salt. 

(d) Cover air-tight, and set away for not 
less than two weeks; the longer, the better, 
provided the jar is kept air-tight. 



THE CHIiSfESE COOK BOOK 17 

HOW TO MAKE TEA 

Use 1 level teaspoonful of tea to 1 cup of 
water. 

Heat the water until it just reaches the boil- 
ing-point, but no more. If you are scientific, 
insert a thermometer graduated with centi- 
grade degrees. When it reaches 99° remove 
from the fire at once. 

Pour immediately into a half-pint teapot 
which contains 1 teaspoonful of Chinese tea. 

Keep covered for three minutes. Then 
serve. 



18 THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION OF SECONDARY 
VEGETABLES 

Before using any dry substance — such as dry 
mushrooms, dry chestnuts, etc. — always soak 
in cool water for ^ hour. 

The making of such things as peanut oil, 
bean cake, Chinese sauce, etc., is practicable 
only for a factory. Any one without conven- 
iences for making them can readily obtain 
them from any Chinese grocery store. 

The author tells how to make them merely 
so that you may know what is in them and how 
they are made. Then you will understand how 
simple they are, and how healthful and nu- 
tritious.

NOODLE SOUP 



YAT KOI MIN 

3 pounds noodles 

2 teaspoonfuls Chinese sauce 

1 teaspoonful oil 

A few drops sesamum-seed oil 

Noodles are made of flour, eggs, salt, and a 
small portion of alkaline solution. 

Inasmuch as good noodles require very skil- 
ful labor to make them, and they can be ob- 
tained much cheaper in a Chinese noodle fac- 
tory than if made at home, the author does not 
describe the process. 

The best quality contains no water. 

To make 7/at koi min (noodle soup) proceed 
as follows: 

(a) Put the noodles into boiling water, and 
boil until they float on the surface. 

(&) Quickly place in cold water and stir. 

(c) Put again into boiling water for 1 min- 
ute. 

{d) Put into a clean bowl containing the 



THE CHINESE COOK BOOK 27 

oil, sesamum-seed oil, Chinese sauce, and a 
little pepper. 

(e) Divide the noodles into individual por-

SHARK FINS 

^» m 

YUE CHE 

This dish has an interesting history. A 
ruler of China found a large shark in the South 
Sea. It was killed. Later, in deciding how 
best to use each part of the animal, a cook by 
the name of Lang Pow invented this dish. 
He discovered how delicious and tasty it was. 
This was in the year 50 B.C. 

Shark fins are prepared as follows: 

The fins and tails are steeped in boiling 
water for I/2 hour. The skin is then scraped 
off with a knife; and the fins and tails are 
boiled for an hour or until they fall to pieces. 
Every piece of meat, skin, and bone is then 
removed. Only what is left, a fin soft yellow 
in color, is kept. This is dried and sold from 
two to three dollars a pound as shark fins. 

{a) Buy 2 pounds of dry shark fins from 
a Chinese grocery store. Soak in cold water 
for 3 hours. 

(b) Boil the fins with a few pieces of dry

CRAB 



HI 



Crabs are found most abundantly in salt 
water. The best quality is found in a place 
where the salt and fresh water mix. Although 
they exist all the year round, the best months 
for crabs are February, July, and August. 
In buying crabs always look for the heavy ones. 
The light ones contain too much water. 

Naturally the most delicious food is crab. 
This is the only meat which contains enough 
salt and oil to fit any one's taste. 

In cooking crab, therefore, all that is neces- 
sary is to wash and steam it until the crab turns 
red. Serve when hot. Sometimes red vinegar 
is used in serving but it is not necessary. 

Never add salt or oil or butter of any kind 
because it spoils the flavor.

BEAN CAKE 

DO ro 

This is a most delicious dish for its price. 
Many people in Paris can tell you how deli- 
cious it is, for there is a factory in Paris which 
makes millions of dollars each year by manu- 
facturing this cake. 

The process of making bean cake is really so 
complicated that it would require a separate 
volume to describe it. 

Put white beans in cold water for a few 
hours. Then grind in a water stone-grinder. 
Cook for 5 hours with calcium powder. Let 
it filter through a cloth and run into a cup 
or bowl. When cool it becomes solid. Tie this 
in a piece of cloth and boil. This is called 
bean cake.

Dr. Wu Tingfang, the former Ambassador 
from China to the United States, told his 
friends that he would return to America in 
fifty years. He said this as he left the United 
States. He was then over sixty years old. His 
reason for expecting long life is that he lives 
entirely on dishes which contain no meat. 

Buddha said that if you leave meat alone 
you will live forever. Therefore the priests 
and nuns belonging to the Buddhist religion 
live on dishes which contain no meat. 

There are many of these dishes.

DRY FOODS 

li m 

LAB MAY 

In ancient times the people preserved foods 
for future use. They would hunt in summer, 
store away the food, and eat it in winter. It 
is very important to store away food. In the 
European War, for instance, the English 
blockade cannot starve the Germans because 
they have plenty of stored foods. Dry foods 
are a necessity. 

The Oriental people have the same idea as 
to storing foods and as to the sanitary prepara- 
tion of these foods. 

If the dry foods were not sanitary they could 
not be imported into America. Every food 
has to be examined by a doctor. All these pre- 
pared foods are certified by a doctor's certifi- 
cate which is proof that they are sanitary.

CONCLUSION 

THE CHEMISTBY OP FOODS 

The most important thing is that food 
should be of the proper quality. Quality is 
more important than quantity. Food must 
also be of the right kind and in season. 

A cook should know what the different foods 
contain, so that he can pick out the most nu- 
tritious. 

Fat only is not a benefit to the body, but 
when combined with other foods it is used as 
fuel. 

The value of food as a source of energy is 
stated by a heat unit called a calory. A calory 
is the amount of heat required to raise the tem- 
perature of one kilogram of water one degree 
centigrade. The fuel value of foods may be 
computed in a different manner. 

Different foods require different lengths of 
time for digestion. 

The following table gives approximately the

Foods have two purposes : first, the repair of 
muscular waste ; second, the supply of the body 
with fuel to keep its heat at about 98°. Both 
are necessary to life. 

Nitrogen is the muscle making substance. 
It is an important ingredient of albumin, 
which is found in its most perfect form in the 
white of an egg. Ham, beef, venison, chicken, 
and beans also are rich.in nitrogen. 

The carbon needed to keep up the body's 
heat is found in rice, cornstarch, potatoes, 
beans and oil.

Onion also is valuable as a food. 

Too much fat is not healthful for the body. 

Man under varying conditions spends dif- 
ferent numbers of calories of heat. The fol- 
lowing table gives approximately the hourly 
expenditure of energy of the normal person 
when asleep, awake, at work, and at rest.

Now, having considered the kinds of food 
necessary for health, let us see why Chinese 
food is better than ordinary food. 

Meats contain too much nitrogen in propor- 
tion to other substances. Vegetables contain 
everything necessary to sustain life. But a 
pure vegetable diet has much waste material, 
such as the cellulose forming the walls of the 
plant-cells, which is indigestible. Hence when

the two are combined in the right proportion 
the diet is the best possible for man. 

Chinese food furnishes just this mixed diet. 

When a man sees or smells something that is 
tasty his mouth begins to water. The water is 
a dilution of hydrochloric acid, with which 
food is digested. If he does not chew his food 
long enough to let the water form and mix 
with the food, he has a sickness known as in- 
digestion. When he goes to a physician the 
physician will give him some form of dilute 
hydrochloric acid to digest his undigested food, 
and so he will feel all right. Since Chinese 
food is prepared in so tasty as well as fancy a 
way, it makes one's mouth water the moment 
you look at it. Therefore it makes indigestion 
impossible.
