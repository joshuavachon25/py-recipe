4 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Besides the characteristic dishes given in this sample day's 
menu there are enough Italian specialties to make sprightly every 
one of the thousand meals in the year: succulent sausages, salami 
of Verona, mortadella of Bologna (now exported in cans); 
ravioli in every imaginable style; chicken livers genovese; copretto 
(kid); the maremma, tortoise and wild boar of Tuscany; the 
fish grills of Genoa; Umbrian baked pudding of rice and chopped 
pigeon; festive fish, eels, frogs' legs, swordfish, tuna, mussels, 
Roman red mullet (truglia), frutti di mare, octopus; endless rice 
dishes (risoto) ; corn meal mush (polenta) ; eggs in unbelievable 
array; bistecca (beef steak); exceptional raw hams; osso buco 
(marrow bones); animelle (sweetbreads); artichokes and car- 
doons, pungent squashes; frittata; almonds and walnuts eaten 
green, chestnuts roasted. Ices, Neapolitan and tutti-frutti ice 
creams. Zabaglione. Distinctive wines and cheeses from every 
province: pale mahogany Marsala and heady Corvo from Sicily; 
Chianti, Capri; Parmesan cheese, Bel Paese, Stracchino, Bra and 
Southern Caccio Carvallo. A full rainbow of figs, a cornucopia 
of fruits. Watermelons red as lipsticks. 

Italy is the bounteous mother of all continental cooking and 
her range of viands is greater than that of any other country. 
She has held her classic place at the head of the table with dignity 
and charm ever since Lucullan days when solons supped on 
nightingales' tongues and emperors rewarded chefs with whole 
cities for the invention of a single dish. Those were the days 
when the soft roe of sea lampreys brought their weight in silver 
and the illustrious red mullet fetched fifty dollars a pound in 
Rome. Roman gastronomes dubbed this fine pink-fleshed fish 
"woodcock of the sea" and thought nothing of paying two or 
three hundred dollars for a fat specimen of the rare "sea-bird." 
It was prepared at the table, boiled alive in a big glass bowl for 
the guests' delight and as its pink flesh turned white in cooking 
and it rolled agonized eyes up to fish heaven in a final prayer 



ITALIAN 5 

Doets were wont to immortalize it in toothsome cantos. Every 
3art of the mullet was deemed so delectable that only its gills 
vvere removed and not eaten. Its liver and trail, indeed, were 
:he choicest parts, reserved for emperors and served up in style, 
dressed with sea-urchin and chicken liver sauce. Today mullet 
.s more often fried in batter than boiled alive on the table, but 
:his sea woodcock has lost none of its ancient popularity. 
I Alfredo's in Rome is the place to eat it pinkly perfect. 

Turbot used to vie with mullet for the favor of gormandiz- 
ng Romans, but it went rapidly out of fashion when the custom 
;ame into vogue of throwing unwanted slaves into private turbot 
jonds, to be eaten alive by the ravenous fish even as Christians 
vvere, in lions' dens. 

The Romans used to import their greatest chefs from Sicily 
md the fame of Sicilian cooks rose to a rhapsodic fervor which 
:aused Cratinus to write 

There lives, I fancy, here within this cave 
Some perfume-seller, or Sicilian coo\. 

Broccoli, with which we became acquainted only in this cen- 
tury, was popular in Caesar's Gaul. Parsley was recommended 
by Pliny as good for the liver. The Romans were great salad 
eaters, of which we have evidence today in the name Romaine 
given to that distinctive variety of lettuce. Great gobblers of 
greens they were, so the phrase "Eat your spinach!" must have 
been familiar in Latin long before Christ was born. 

The French cuisine grew directly out of the Italian, and very 
late at that. Savarin himself admitted that modern French 
restaurant cooking got its inspiration from its Southern neighbor 
and that before the year eighteen hundred Paris couldn't hold a 
holy candle to Rome as a gastronomic solar plexus. And beef- 
eating London with its Turk's Head and Ye Olde Cocke taverns 
gave the palm as well to the original Roman ristorante. 



6 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

The Italian cuisine is based on tasty pastes, chiefly macaroni, 
spaghetti and ravioli, pepped up with garlic, peppers, anchovies, 
olive oil, tomato paste, funghi (mushrooms), grated Parmesan 
cheese and capers. More than any other cuisine it depends on 
accompanying wines and fruits. And what fruits! Enormous 
Palermo oranges with flaming cheeks. Mandarins and blood 
oranges, sunkist lemons picked ripe and hence sweet enough to 
eat out of hand. Peaches and pomegranates beyond compare. 
A luscious melange summed up in the Neapolitan tutti-frutti (all 
fruits), which we have taken over as the apt name for fruit- 
flavored chewing gum. 

Fruit is the national dessert from Northern Merano where 
folks go to take the grape cure and linger to drink the new Fall 
wine, with accompanying chestnuts and dancing in the streets, 
all the way down to southernmost Sicily where the adage about 
fruit is changed to "fruit is silver in the morning, golden at noon 
and platinum at night." Some Italians will not go all the way 
with this slogan, however, for though they all gorge on fruit at 
noon it is commonly served as a compote at night. Elaborate 
sweets are not sought in countries flowing with wine and honey, 
so cakes, ices and zabaglione (wine-flavored) are the standard 
desserts. 

North, Central and South, down the long peninsula, regional 
menus vary considerably, of course, yet the daily diet of a 
Piedmontese is substantially the same as that of a Sicilian. 
Spaghetti, macaroni, vermicelli, ribboned fettuccini (noodlelike), 
or some other of the score of succulent pastes, spiced with garlic 
and with Parmesan strewed over it, is almost sure to appear at 
the noon meal, in spite of Mussolini's dictate that too much starch 
must not be consumed, for fear of ruining the race through 
indigestion. The rule is spaghetti at noon, soup at night, and 
since spaghetti is considered the equivalent of soup, both paste 
and potage are never partaken of at the same meal. 



ITALIAN 7 

Whatever the meat course, there is almost sure to be a touch 
of giblets with it, or in the sauce. There will be crusty bread 
in great variety, hearty red wine and a fine chunk of cheese 
wherever you lunch; and these three alone, with fruit of course, 
and more than a suspicion of garlic rubbed on the wholesome 
bread or slivered into the salad, make a meal fit for modern 
centurions. 

Plenty of vitamins in this menu, provided by raw vegetables 
and fruits. Sliced tomatoes and peppers take the place of our 
cooked potatoes and corn. Salad is served as a matter of course, 
dressed with red wine vinegar, juice of ripe lemons and the 
tastiest of pale green olive oil — that from Lucca being the world's 
finest. The salad is snappy, sharper than the French, and so are 
all Italian condiments, excepting only the exciting French vinegar 
flavored with tarragon. Italian mustard is spicier and hotter 
than any other and also darker in color. Even the Parmesan 
cheese that is sprinkled over everything is highly pungent, livelier 
in taste than any other powdered cheese. Mushrooms, too, (both 
funghi and cepes) have a stronger tang than the standard French 
champignon. Pickled cepes, though they belong to the mush- 
room family, are as popular as the giblets of all animals and 
provide a similar exotic touch to many dishes — they might indeed 
be called vegetable chicken livers, being as fat and meaty. They 
are golden yellow burnished with red, but often too rich, a bit 
too coarse and slippery for our palate. 

Besides liking his food au naturel the Italian eats out-of- 
doors when the weather permits. This gusto for dining al 
fresco is carried even into the heart of cities where robust, deep- 
breathing people sit at table in sidewalk restaurants and glass- 
covered galleries bustling with shoppers. Or in city gardens — 
we remember one in Rome, with tables all around a gold 
fish pond, adorned with a marble bust of that great feaster 
Aesophagus. 



8 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Cooking is done primitively still, especially in the Italian 
countryside, over charcoal braziers, on spits and in clay-covered 
bee-hive ovens, but it is all the more perfect for that. A country 
kitchen, or even a city one, is not as clean as a German cook's, 
but that is because it usually serves as pantry and dining room 
too. This room where the cooking is done is the true heart of 
the home, one wall ablaze with a battery of tin-lined pots to 
prove the family's generosity of appetite; pots, pans and gravy- 
catchers, all hanging copper side out to reflect the fire and sun 
in golden glints. These utensils are dangerous as soon as they 
wear through to the copper and must then be sent to be retinned. 
Bunches of herbs are thrust handy in smoke blackened rafters, 
there are dangling braids of garlic and onions, strings of pepper 
and dried mushrooms, with winking demijohns of wine both 
red and white brightening dark corners. A grayish block of 
expensive vintage Parmesan cheese stands beside its grater, be- 
neath which is the wooden bowl that is filled with fresh, savory 
powdered Parmesan before each repast. The bowl has a wooden 
spoon to match. 

Breakfast is scarcely considered a meal, since it follows the 
slim fashion known everywhere as Continental — although really 
it is Latin, for neighboring continentals, the Dutch, for example, 
eat enormous meat breakfasts. Throughout Italy the fast is 
broken on rising with blackish coffee mixed with hot milk, often 
rich, creamy goats' milk, and a slice of bread, although butter 
and a small saucer of celestial honey are added if the breakfaster 
isn't too spartan or too poor. In some hardy peasant sections 
even coffee is too great a luxury, so the farmer roasts several 
whole heads of garlic and eats it with his bread. But be it noted 
that the roasting of garlic takes the sting out of it, makes it taste 
syrupy sweet, a miracle with which we are familiar in roast 
onions. 

Luncheon starts with antipasto (appetizers) including salami 



ITALIAN 9 

and a curl of well-aged ham, anchovies always, sometimes 
wrapped around capers; tuna, pickled mushrooms, artichoke 
hearts, olives both black and green, cold veal, fish mayonnaise, 
radishes, fennel, peppers green and red; and whatever this hors 
d'oeuvre consists of, each tidbit is served in a small separate dish 
and drenched v with the delicate emerald green olive oil of Lucca. 
Even raw vegetables, such as celery and fennel, are dipped in 
oil, salt and pepper, to greatly improve their relish. Dry white 
wine is drunk with the antipasto, the favorite types being Cortese 
and Capri. Antipasto opens the appetite for the paste which 
often is filled with meat, as ravioli and timbales, and is quite 
certain to be seasoned with garlic and flavored with tomato. The 
Italian tomato, pomodoro, is the size of a pigeon egg, meatier 
than our love apple, stronger and sharper in essence. It is 
pounded to a pulp and sold in immense cans, always shiny 
and red. 

Baked pastes, usually macaroni or thick noodles, are also 
flavored chiefly with tomato, but boiled pastes, generally spaghetti, 
thin tagliarini (noodles), or vermicelli the size of string, some- 
times appear alia burro, dressed with sweet butter alone, the 
butter melting quickly into the steaming dish. Spaghetti is 
ordered alia dente by the knowing, and that means it must be 
cooked a minute or two less than usual, so the teeth themselves 
may test its virtue and grind out the full wheat flavor. Spaghetti, 
of course, must be boiled to order and served on the instant, for 
it gets soggy and flavorless if it isn't eaten piping hot the second 
it is done and the sauce mixed with it, by lifting the mass several 
times with a fork and a spoon to let the excess steam escape 
and thoroughly impregnate the paste with its luscious gravy. 
Spaghetti cooked by an Italian expert is as light and fluffy as 
pancakes, it is dry and of good body, even its steam when sucked 
into the mouth has a hearty savor of the real thing and reminds 
one of the appetizing exhalation of hot homemade biscuits. 



io THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

The bull-fighting Spaniards like their beef when it has 
reached maturity, but the Italian takes his in the shape of veal, 
as young as he can get it. He eats tender kid, too, before it has 
become strong goat; and this seems reasonable, for while veal 
is tough and hard to digest, cavorting kid is as juicily gelatinous 
as suckling pig. But the Italian chef overcomes the difficulty with 
veal by flaying it for five or ten minutes before he dips it in eggy 
bread-crumbs and tosses it in the frying pan. At noon Naples 
resounds with the pounding of veal cutlets (scallopini) — the town 
seems to be peopled with trick drummers, practicing intricate 
beats and trying out their traps. 

Slices of lemon garnish scallopini and add zest to all fish 
dishes besides. Lemons and oranges, in fact, helped Italy get 
her cooking head start of France. Bananas, figs, pears, grapes, 
melons, peaches, pomegranates did their share, too, for Italy's 
cornucopia is not only full to the brim with Southern delicacies 
and luxuries of food but overflows with wines besides: Muscatel, 
Malvasia, Marsala, Falerno, Grignolino, Salerno, Frascati, Orvieto, 
Asti Spumante and Sparkling Barberas and Nebiolos, an endless 
variety of them from top to toe of the Italian boot. 

To finish off the luncheon we have Gorgonzola cheese (for- 
maggio Gorgonzola) richer than Roquefort. A ripe banana 
goes well with Gorgonzola; because of the resemblance in fruity 
flavor each supplements the other. Caffe nero, bitter black coffee, 
is prepared in a unique style known as espresso, in city restau- 
rants or cafes. A demitasse is filled from a big nickel-plated 
steam engine that expresses the essence of a heaping tablespoon- 
ful of powdered coffee into each tiny cup. This finishes off the 
luncheon (colazione) and usually is accompanied by a cigarette 
or cigar. But tobacco is a government monopoly here, as in most 
Latin countries, so the cigarettes are worse than English 
"gaspers," almost as bad as French Bleus. Cigars are no better; 
the national Toscani is brittle and badly made, its draught is 



ITALIAN ii 

furnished by a straw thrust down the center and the puffs are 
very stingy and eye-reddening. Though matches are no part of 
the meal, and shouldn't even be used for toothpicks, a final 
smoke is the last course for many, so it might as well be recorded 
that Italy, like Spain and the Argentine, is addicted to short wax 
vestas which sputter and stench and burn the fingers with molten 
wax, unless you are very adroit in handling these miniature 
Vesuviuses. 

No dinner in the world can improve on the pranzo; it is 
a classic of meals, perfectly balanced and taste teasing, straight 
from the elegant antipasto (appetizers) through the minestrone 
(soup-of -soups) and the mixed fry (fritto misto), with its 
piquance of individual portions of cheese, kidney, brains, liver, 
scallops of meat and giblets, a spray of broccoli — all coated with 
rich egg batter and fried golden. 

Italy just escapes being a chicken-and-egg country, such as 
Spain and Cuba, for a polio pranzo (chicken dinner) is relished 
as much as it is anywhere on earth, and the mushrooms served 
with the fowl make it all the more delicious. Then the sharp 
Southern salad of admirable greens and finally a matchless bisque 
tortoni, for at making frozen desserts the country has had several 
thousand years' experience. The Roman emperors were great 
consumers of ices and used to send their slaves up the Apennines 
for snow to cool their fruit juices on hot summer days. The 
iced granate or granite sipped by the Caesars is even more 
popular today. It is the primitive cooler named after the pome- 
granate from which it was first compounded, a tall tumbler of 
shaved ice or snow covered with the ruby red juice of the fruit. 
A splendid modern variant is granite con panna, iced coffee and 
thick cream; but all flavors and fruit juices are used. The granite 
is, in fact, the original ice cream soda — so we, as well as the 
French, have much to thank Mother Italy for. 

The sweet orange liqueur of Strega is drunk with the coffee, 



12 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

or in its place a thimble of the cherry elixir Maraschino from 
Dalmatia, now within Italy's borders. These liqueurs top of? 
the meal — and you have dined well in Milan, Venice, Rome or 
Messena. Never forgetting the wine, which stands in the center 
of the table throughout the splendid repast; a half gallon flagon, 
or better, encased in gaily colored straw, conveniently held in a 
swivel-bottomed silver container which swings the bottle to the 
glass of each guest and facilitates the pouring. 

The true Italian flavor can be achieved only by the use of 
Italian products, either imported or furnished by Italian-Ameri- 
can firms which supply the Italian grocers who set up shop in 
nearly all American towns. 

The most important ingredients are: 

Olive oil. 

Garlic. A little is always enjoyed, even by the most prejudiced, 
if its presence is not suspected. 

Parmesan cheese. The grated Parmesan, which comes in 
packages, will have lost much of its flavor. Any Italian 
grocer will grate it on request, and be pleased that his 
particular importation, or American imitation, is appreciated. 

Tomato paste. This concentrated essence saves the time and 
trouble of reducing tomato juice or canned tomatoes, and 
gives the genuine Italian tang, besides being economical. It 
can be bought by weight out of big containers, always open 
and at hand in Italian groceries. 

Salted anchovies. These can also be bought by weight out 
of big tins. They cost a fraction of the price and are better 
for cooking than the kind that come in bottles, preserved 
in oil. They must lie in cold water 1-2 hours, to extract the 
salt, before being skinned and boned. 



ITALIAN 13 

Dried mushrooms. A few ounces kept in an open jar, over 
which a cloth may be tied, are convenient for those recipes 
which call for a little mushroom flavoring. Soaked for sev- 
eral hours and then minced and added, with their liquor, 
to sauces or soups, they have a higher flavoring value than 
fresh mushrooms. A little goes a long way, and thus they 
are more economical than the fresh ones. 

For the antipasto plate, there are tuna fish, pickled peppers, 
canned cepes, and Italian sausages. 

Herbs, especially basil, for flavoring; red wine vinegar for 
salads; pine nuts for special dishes; the best of salt codfish; 
spaghetti and other pastes, properly made from hard wheat; 
Gorgonzola and other imported cheeses ; and hearty hearth bread, 
which should go with every Italian menu. 



APPETIZERS 

(Antipasto) 



PISSALADEIRA 

8 salt anchovies Onion rings 

l /i standard recipe bread dough Thin slices cheese 

Olive oil Thin slices tomato 

i dozen stoned olives Salt and pepper 

Soak anchovies in cold water two hours; clean and take of? 
the fillets. Pat out bread dough i inch thick, to fit a round pan 
about one foot in diameter. Oil the pan with olive oil, lay in 
the dough and let it rise. Decorate the top with onion rings, 
tomato slices, and cheese slices; arrange the anchovy fillets and 
olives attractively in the open spaces between the slices, and lay 
some within the onion rings and on top of the tomato slices. 
Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle generously with olive 
oil. Bake in a hot oven (400 F.) 20 minutes. 

This is a Neapolitan specialty, but is also found all along 
the Riviera, where it is made and consumed by the fishermen. 
From the spelling of the name it evidently originated with the 
Portuguese who once fished the Mediterranean. The pain baig- 
nade, open-faced sandwich, made of half a split hearth loaf, cov- 
ered with tomato, onion slices, olives, and anchovies and sprinkled 
with anchovy oil, is a quick version of the pissaladeira. This 
sandwich is familiar to tourists, for it is served to bathers on the 
beaches of the Italian and French Rivieras.

ITALIAN 15 

ANCHOVY CANAPES 

Salted anchovies Rounds of hearth bread 

Butter Green olives, chopped 

Grated Parmesan 

Soak anchovies 2 hours in cold water; rub off skin and strip 
fillets from the bones. Mash several anchovies to a paste; mix 
with melted butter, strain. Heat, and quickly fry bread brown 
on both sides. Cover fried bread with anchovy fillets, sprinkle 
with the chopped olives, and then with Parmesan. Place for a 
moment under grill for cheese to color, and serve hot. 

ANCHOVY SALAD 

THE SALAD 

i pound salted anchovies 1 pickled beet, diced 

1 onion, chopped fine 1 tablespoon capers 

Vi green pepper, chopped fine 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped 

THE DRESSING 

i cup Italian olive oil X A teaspoon sugar 

% cup red wine vinegar Pepper, freshly ground 

THE GARNISH 

3 hard-boiled eggs, quartered 1 tablespoon capers 

Lettuce leaves 1 green pepper, chopped fine 

Water cress 1 onion, chopped fine 

2 pickled beets, diced 

Soak the salted anchovies over night, rub off skin, remove 
bones by stripping each anchovy carefully down the center. Dry 
them and place in salad bowl. Add all other salad ingredients. 

Thoroughly beat together the olive oil, vinegar, sugar and 
pepper to taste. Pour the dressing over the anchovies and let 
stand 30 minutes, turning and making sure that each anchovy 
absorbs all the dressing it can hold. 



i6 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Then lay out the anchovies on a platter in criss-cross design, 
and pour the remaining dressing over them. Add a little clear 
green olive oil and garnish with eggs, lettuce and water cress, 
piling up beets, capers and pepper in contrasting colors. 

Serve with crusty Italian bread. 

Anchovies bottled in oil may be substituted, California 
pilchards or any sardines, but the salad will not be as tasty as it 
is when made of the salted anchovies shipped from Italy in huge 
tins and sold cheaply in every Italian quarter. 

DRESSING FOR FISH AND SEA FOOD SALADS 

i slice stale bread Yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs 

1 garlic clove, crushed 12 ripe olives, pitted 
Vinegar 1 teaspoon minced parsley 

2 dozen pinenuts 1 cup olive oil 
2 tablespoons capers Salt 

4 anchovy fillets Pepper 

Cut crusts from bread, rub it with garlic and sprinkle with 
sufficient vinegar to moisten. Put through a food chopper, using 
finest knife, with pinenuts, capers, anchovy fillets, egg yolks, 
olives and parsley. Work to a paste with a wooden spoon, then 
pass through a coarse sieve. Stir in olive oil until all used. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper and more vinegar if desired. 
Beat until thoroughly mixed. This dressing is suitable for a 
salad of this type. 

Equal amounts of flaked cooked fish and finely-cut cooked 
vegetables moistened with French dressing, perhaps with the 
addition of anchovies and cooked shrimp. Garnish elaborately 
with cooked vegetables, green salad, tomatoes and hard-boiled 
eggs. 



ITALIAN 17 

CROSTINI OF CHICKEN LIVERS 
{Crostini di Fegatini de Polio) 

12 chicken livers Salt and pepper 

2 tablespoons fat ham, minced Olive oil 

1 scallion, minced 2-3 mushrooms 

Yz teaspoon minced parsley Meat broth, heated 

l / 2 small carrot, minced 1 teaspoon bread crumbs 

l /z celery stalk, minced 1 teaspoon lemon juice 
Sippets of dry bread 

Carefully remove galls from livers. Make a bed of ham and 
vegetables in sauce pan. Season; sprinkle with oil and simmer. 
Lay livers and mushrooms on top and simmer 5 minutes. Take 
up mushrooms and livers, mince, and return to pan. Moisten 
with broth and simmer 2 minutes, stirring once or twice. Add 
crumbs, and lemon juice, and mix well, adding a little more 
broth if necessary. Serve on just enough bread sippets to absorb 
the sauce. 

The French canape sometimes makes its appearance in 
Italian hotels under the name of Crostini. But the true Crostini 
is an open hot sandwich of more substantial form. It takes the 
place of the antipasto, or hors d'oeuvres, is included in the divi- 
sion of the dinner termed Principii, and is served after the soup. 

PICKLED MUSHROOMS 

1 pint small button mushrooms 1 blade mace, broken 
1 teaspoon salt 1 garlic clove, quartered 

1 teaspoon peppercorns Vinegar 

Rub mushrooms clean with a cloth wet in vinegar, and cut 
off stems. Pack in a glass jar, scattering in salt, peppercorns, 
mace and garlic. Cover with vinegar, close jar and set away 
for 2 days. Serve with Italian antipasto. 






SOUPS, PASTE, RICE AND POLENTA 

(Zuppa, Pasta, Riso, e Polenta) 



MINESTRONE SOUP 

*4 pound bacon, chopped i celery stalk, sliced 

*4 pound ham, chopped % cup rice 

or a ham bone Salt and pepper 

1Y2 quarts meat broth % head cabbage, chopped 

1 large onion, chopped 1 cup green vegetables, mixed 
1 large tomato, chopped (peas, lima beans, green 

Yz cup navy beans, soaked beans, asparagus tips, etc.) 

Grated Parmesan cheese 

Fry bacon, ham and onion together, slowly, until lightly 
browned. Add all other ingredients except cabbage, green vege- 
tables and Parmesan cheese. Simmer and skim until beans are 
tender. Add cabbage and vegetables. Simmer until cooked, 
and the minestrone is thick. The addition of a skinned and 
chopped Italian sausage is an improvement. Serve with a tea- 
spoon of Parmesan cheese in each soup plate. 

This cross between a stew and a soup is native to Milan, but 
is encountered all over Italy, with many variations depending on 
the products of the district and the resources of the larder. 

PUMPKIN SOUP 
{Zuppa di Zucca) 

1 cup water 2 tablespoons butter 

3 cups pumpkin, diced 3 cups milk 

1 tablespoon granulated sugar Salt 

Croutons 
18 



ITALIAN

Add water to pumpkin, sugar, and butter, and cook slowly 
until very tender, adding a little more water if necessary. Press- 
through a sieve. Heat milk to boiling: add pumpkin, season 
with a very little salt; heat, and serve with croutons. Can be 
instantly prepared with canned pumpkin. 

This is a fast-day soup of Northern Italy, served by the 
peasants as a course of the light evening meal. 

FROG SOUP 

(Zuppa di Ranocchi) 

1 sprig basil 



1 dozen frogs 
3 tablespoons olive oil 
1 garlic clove, minced 
1 small onion, minced 
1 small carrot, minced 
1 sprig parsley 



1 sprig celery 

1 tomato, chopped 

2 mushrooms, chopped 
Salt and pepper 
2 tablespoons sifted bread crumbs 

Fingers of toast 

Separate the frogs' hind legs. Cut up all other edible por- 
tions, including the livers. Heat oil; add garlic, onion, carrot, 
and herbs. Fry slowly until slightly colored. Add tomato and 
mushrooms. Add cut-up portions of frogs and 3 pints cold 
water. Bring slowly to a boil, and simmer until meat is falling 
from bones. Strain. Season with salt and pepper. Add hind 
legs, simmer until tender; add crumbs; serve with fingers of toast. 

ANALONI, PARMA STYLE 
(Anolini alia Parmiagana) 



Yz onion, chopped 
2 tablespoons butter 
8 peppercorns 

1 herb bouquet 

2 pounds soup meat 

Ys pound salt pork, chopped 
2 quarts cold water 



Yz cup sifted crumbs, toasted 

Yz cup Parmesan cheese, grated 

1 grating nutmeg 

1 egg white, well beaten 

1 standard recipe noodle dough 

1 cup rose wine (or light red) 

1 teaspoon salt 



20 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Slowly fry onion in butter until golden brown. Add pepper- 
corns, herb bouquet, soup meat and salt pork. Cover with the 
cold water and bring slowly to a boil. Add salt, skim and 
simmer 5 hours. 

Make a filling of the crumbs, Parmesan cheese, nutmeg and 
egg white. 

Roll noodle dough very thin, cut out 2-inch scalloped circles. 
Put spoonsful of the filling in center of each circle and fold over, 
sealing * edges together securely. 

Strain broth, bring to a fast boil, add wine and cook stuffed 
paste in this for 5 to 7 minutes. 

This broth serves for any soup in which pastes are to be 
cooked. If the meat has been larded with the pork, it may be 
browned with the onions and served with a sauce the next day, 
as is done in Italy. 

LITTLE COCKED HATS 

(Cappelletti alia Romagna) 

*4 pound chicken or veal, 1 dash allspice 

cooked 1 grating nutmeg 

2 tablespoons butter 1 egg y well beaten 

*4 pound raviggiolo or cream 1 egg yolk, well beaten 

or cottage cheese 1 standard recipe noodle dough 

3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, 2 quarts chicken broth 

grated 

Slightly brown the meat in the butter, and grind. Mix with 
both cheeses, the spices, egg and egg yolk and work all together 
thoroughly. Roll out noodle dough to about Y$ inch in thick- 
ness. Cut in 2V2 inch rounds. Place a small amount of the 
filling in the center of each and fold, sealing edges securely. 
Cook from 5 to 7 minutes in the chicken broth which has been 
heated to boiling and serve hot with the broth in soup plates. 

This is a special Christmas and holiday dish. 

* Press edges together, moistening with a little water if necessary. 






ITALIAN 21 

TORTELLINI, BOLOGNA STYLE 

(Tortellini alia Bolognese) 

2 ounces bacon 2 eggs 

1V2 ounces mortadello Dash of nutmeg 

(Bologna sausage) Ravioli paste (see recipe) 

4 ounces beef marrow 2 quarts clear soup 

Finely grind bacon and mortadello together; work marrow 
to a cream; mix together and work to a paste. Add egg and 
nutmeg, (use no other seasonings) and mix well. Roll paste 
thin; cut in i^-inch circles. Spread some of paste on one disk 
and cover with another, pressing edges together with fingers 
until all are used. (Edges of disks may be slightly dampened 
with water.) Let stand at least 15 minutes. Drop into boiling, 
rich, well-flavored clear soup; cook 8 minutes. Serve at once. 

The filling of Bologna is rich and nourishing; so Professor 

Artusi attributes to its goodness, and to the influence of the 

healthful climate, the fact that so many of the inhabitants of the 

Bologna district live to see eighty and even ninety years. The 

excellent mortadella, or Bologna sausage, is often credited to 

the Germans, who prepare it nicely. But the true Bologna is 

made in the Italian city which gives it its name. It is exported 

to America in tins, already sliced and ready for the antipasto 

platter. 

r PLAIN SPAGHETTI 

4 quarts rapidly boiling water 2 tablespoons salt 

1 pound spaghetti 

Hold the ends of a handful of spaghetti in the salted water 
and as it softens let the entire lengths slide in. Repeat until all 
is in the pot. While doing this the water must continue its rapid 
boiling. The time of cooking depends on the quality of the 
flour from which it is made, also the thickness of the spaghetti, 






22 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

and personal taste. The poorer the spaghetti, the more quickly 
it cooks. The test of pinching a strand with the ringers should 
be applied; if it feels firm but still pinches in two easily, it is 
done alia denti. If it is soft and separates almost without pres- 
sure, it is ready as many Americans like it. The time will vary 
from 12 to 1 8 minutes. Drain in a colander, and dash through 
it a cup or more of cold water to firm it. Serve in any of the 
following manners: 

SPAGHETTI WITH BUTTER 

{Spaghetti al Burro) 

Turn the cooked spaghetti into a hot dish. Put into it % 
cup of sweet butter, sprinkle over it % cup grated Parmesan 
cheese and lift and move it about with fork and spoon until

as chopped cooked mushrooms, may be substituted for the 
chicken livers. 

Spaghetti table manners are no better than corn-on-the-cob 
tactics, or maneuvers with a juicy mango, which really should 
be eaten in the bath tub. Emily Post would be horrified to see 
how spaghetti is gargled, guzzled and goozled according to the 
etiquette of each Italian province. The trick is indeed, to keep 
stray ravellings of it from slipping down the corsage or into the 
shoe. Some wrap it around a dessert spoon or whirl it fast 
around a fork, pop it into the mouth and bite it off. Others 
make a game of it, like diabolo, or they catch the end of one 
starchy string and englut it endlessly, like a cat playing with a 
spool of thread. Only Anglo-Saxons either break it to awkward 
bits or chop it off in short mouthfuls with knife and fork. 






ITALIAN 25 

Caruso was one of the neatest spaghetti eaters we ever saw, 
and today a brand of his favorite paste is named in his honor. 
Members of Italian opera companies are always half-starved dur- 
ing the performance, since it is necessary to sing on an empty 
stomach. But they make up for this after the show by holding 
back-stage banquets, and spaghetti is often the piece de resistance. 
We saw Caruso at one of these feasts in Chicago, in the early 
years of this century. He just dipped informally into the main 
dish, snagged out a hank of spaghetti highly colored with tomato 
gravy, lifted it dripping the whole arm's length above his head 
and let it glide luxuriously down his musical throat. 

MACARONI, VERMICELLI, TAGLIARINI, AND 
OTHER PASTES 

The cooking time varies from 5 minutes for the hair-like 
vermicelli, to a half hour for the thickest of the macaronis. They 
can be served like spaghetti; can be added to soups; or special 
dishes can be made with them from the following suggestions: 

BAKED MACARONI 

In a buttered baking dish alternate layers of cooked macaroni 
with layers of minced meat in plenty of gravy; fowl, veal, beef, 
or ham, all well seasoned; or chopped stewed mushrooms in a 
tasty sauce of their own liquor, thickened slightly. 

Cauliflower flowerettes in plenty of thin cream sauce made 
yellow with butter and flavored with grated Parmesan cheese 
can be used instead of the meat ragouts; creamed onions can 
be used in the same way; always remembering that macaroni 
will absorb a great deal of liquid, and the finished dish must 
be moist. 

Or, seasoned tomatoes in thin slices may be laid between 
the layers of macaroni, when the dish must be filled with tomato 
sauce. 



26 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Or, simply, slices of yellow cheese may alternate with the 
macaroni layers, when the dish is filled with milk. 

Always finish with a generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, 
a sprinkling of bread crumbs, and dots of butter. Bake until 
nicely brown. 

' VERMICELLI 

Vermicelli combines happily with fish. Serve cooked vermi- 
celli like spaghetti with anchovies (see recipe). 

Or, combine minced fish and minced olives with tomato 
sauce, and prepare and cook like baked macaroni. Tinned 
tunny, or poached and boned smelts are often used in this way 
in Italy. 

J TAGLIARINI 

These Italian noodles are best prepared like spaghetti al burro 
(see recipe). 

In England spaghetti and macaroni usually appear on the 
menu as vegetables, and for a while this gave rise to odd con- 
ceptions on the part of tourists unfamiliar with Italy's pastes. 
Some visioned waving fields of spaghetti standing ripe and 
ready for the harvester's scythe, others thought the hollow 
macaroni was some kind of thick-stemmed water reed, but thanks 
to Italian immigration these specialties are now as familiar as 
German noodles. So nowadays no one is likely to fall into the 
error of ordering a plate of new-mown spaghetti. 

As a matter of fact, the making of macaroni was a secret 
held within Italy until the fourteenth century, when it was in- 
troduced into France. The history of the discovery of macaroni 
is preserved in Naples; where early in the thirteenth century one 
Chicho was suddenly impoverished by a turn of fortune and 
decided that he would spend the rest of his life doing good for 
others. 

His first plan was to invent some tasty and economical food 
for everybody. He invested what little was left of his money 



ITALIAN 27 

in materials and equipment and set to work in a humble attic 
on a small Neapolitan byway called Cortillari. There he labored 
night and day over his experiments. In a tall building across the 
court-like street a shrewd woman called Javanella could overlook 
his attic. She saw Chicho hard at work by candle light mixing 
his wheat flour and pressing it through the crude apparatus he 
had invented, watched him cook the long threads which came 
out of the machine, observed the ingredients which he stewed 
together to make the sauce, saw him eat it and knew that what 
he had made must taste very good, so she busied herself in 
imitating the new dish. 

Other neighbors suspected that mysterious things were going 
on in Chicho's room, lighted even after midnight, so it was easy 
for Javanella to spread the rumor that he was a sorcerer, and so 
discredit him until she had stolen the secret of making his dish. 
Javanella's husband was a kitchen man at the palace of King 
Frederick, so the good wife cooked a sample for him and con- 
fided that the recipe had been revealed to her by an angel in a 
dream. Since her husband highly approved of the unique and 
satisfying dish she begged him to ask the king's chef to allow 
her to make it for the king. 

The chef arranged to have macaroni served at the king's 
table and he, himself, became as puffed up as the cooked paste 
through knowing a mortal who consorted with angels and had 
thus come into possession of a miraculous recipe. 

King Frederick ate his fill of Javanella's angel food and pro- 
nounced it divine. He showed his appreciation by giving her a 
hundred pieces of gold, which was a fortune in those days. From 
then on, macaroni appeared often at the king's table and Java- 
nella's fame spread through Naples. Princes and aristocrats 
came to buy her recipe and serve the luscious paste at their 
banquets of state. 

Meanwhile honest Chicho finished his experiments, left his 



28 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

house for the first time in many weeks and fared forth with 
the intention of divulging his secret to a certain prince who 
might become his patron. He sniffed the air! — surely, that was 
his own sauce cooking somewhere. He followed his nose until 
he came upon a cook in the very act of pouring the rich sauce 
over a pot of steaming paste. She told him she had bought the 
recipe from Javanella, who had got it from an angel; that all 
the rich people in Naples were reveling in it and the king him- 
self had made Javanella a rich woman. 

Chicho crept back to his attic and could be heard smashing 
up his mixing machines and experimental kitchen. He was 
never seen again, but his ghost still haunts the Cortillari. On 
Hallowe'en he can be heard rolling and rolling his paste while 
Javanella stirs and stirs the sauce and the devil pokes the fire and 
grates the cheese. 

So jealous of their secret recipe were the Neapolitans that 
it was many years before it spread to the other principalities of 
Italy, and a whole century passed before a Frenchman got hold 
of it and took it for the first time beyond the borders of Italy. 

Naples was the center of macaroni manufacture for so many 
centuries that the Pompeian Road leading into it was broken to 
bits by the continuous procession of wagons and trucks hauling 
in hard wheat and flour to make the staff of life of Southern 
Italy. Then the town of Gragnano, near Sorrento, set up rival 
mills and began to supply the whole world with Chicho's flour 
paste. It had to be made of very hard (durum) wheat, such as 
is grown in Russia, Algeria, Argentina and America, so gradu- 
ally Italian pastes became known in these countries and little 
factories were set up to make them locally. 

Macaroni is made of moist hard wheat ground to a coarse 
meal, the free flour is then sifted out and the meal kneaded with 
hot water into a stiff dough which is squirted under pressure 
into the machine that forms it. The best quality comes in long 



ITALIAN 29 

pieces that are hung up to dry without breaking, but the poorer 
grades do not hold together so well, hence they are sold in short, 
uneven lengths. Good paste is rough in texture, yellowish white 
and as brittle as glass. It must be elastic and never sticky. Since 
it absorbs three times its weight in water it swells to double 
its size when boiled. 

RAVIOLI 

PASTE 
1V2 cups flour % teaspoon salt 

r egg, slightly beaten 1 tablespoon cold water 

Pour flour in a heap on a board, making a depression in the 
center; drop in the tgg y salt and water. With a fork mix a stifl 
paste and knead. Flour board very lightly and roll out very thin. 
Cut in two exactly in the center. Let lie five minutes after 
making sure that the paste is not sticking to the board. 1%. 
inches apart drop half -teaspoons of one of the following mixtures, 
on one half the paste. Lift the other half of the sheet of paste 
and lay on top. With the finger press the two layers together 
along their lines of contact. And then, with a rotary cutter, cut 
the raviolis in inch-and-a-quarter squares, leaving the filling in 
the center of each square. Again press down the edges with the 
finger to make sure the stuffing does not fall out in cooking. Let 
stand 15 minutes or more. Drop into a large kettle of rapidly 
boiling water, and boil 10-12 minutes. Lift out with a skimmer, 
draining well. Serve with tomato sauce and grated Parmesan 
cheese. 

MEAT FILLING 

i cup (cooked) chicken, turkey, 1 egg, beaten 

or veal % teaspoon lemon peel, grated 

1 tablespoon grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon butter 

cheese l / 2 teaspoon minced parsley 

Salt and pepper to taste 






30 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Grind meat very fine. Thoroughly mix with other in- 
gredients. If any of the filling is left after making the ravioli, 
add it to the tomato sauce. 

GREEN FILLING 

i cup cooked spinach, minced i egg, beaten 

Yi cup cottage cheese Salt 

i tablespoon grated Parmesan Pepper 

cheese i tablespoon sifted crumbs 

Drain and press spinach dry. Mix with other ingredients. 
Proceed as above. Serve with butter or with tomato sauce, and 
more grated Parmesan cheese. If the spinach is too moist, more 
bread crumbs will be necessary, but the addition will detract from 
the excellence of the dish. 

OTHER FILLINGS 

As is the case with other pastes, ravioli recipes vary all over 
Italy. The meat filling can be varied by using poached calf's 
brains, sweetbreads, or chicken livers without the Parmesan 
cheese. Or any tasty combination of meats, such as chicken and 
sweetbreads, veal and calf's brains, chicken and chicken livers, 
chicken and veal, etc., providing only that the meats are finely 
ground and thoroughly mixed together. 

No Italian specialty is more appreciated than ravioli, and 
none better displays the skill of the cook. For a ravioli party 
the ravioli and the sauce can be prepared well in advance. 

PANATA 

Y 3 loaf stale bread, grated 4 eggs, beaten 

2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese 2 cups hot meat broth 

1 grating nutmeg Salt 

Mix crumbs, Parmesan cheese and nutmeg; stir in the eggs. 
Add broth a little at a time, stirring constantly. Salt to taste. 



ITALIAN 31 

Cook in double boiler until very thick and mixture separates 
from side of pan. Heap up in a hot dish and serve very hot. 

Green peas, or other green vegetables, are sometimes mixed 
with this panata. They should be cooked separately and added 
with the broth. 

This is a very ancient dish of Tuscany, where it is known as 

tridura. 

RISOTTO 

1 cup rice Vi teaspoon saffron 

% cup butter 1 cup white wine, heated 

1 onion, chopped 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 

1 quart meat broth, boiling 1 pound fresh mushrooms 

Salt and pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 

Brown rice in butter; add onion and fry for a few minutes. 
Add 1 pint broth and boil rapidly, gently shaking the pan to 
prevent sticking as it evaporates; add remaining stock; season, 
and continue boiling, reducing heat as liquid is absorbed. Add 
saffron, mixed with a little water; add wine and cheese. Mix 
gently and set over steam until dry and fluffy. Have mushrooms 
washed, dried, quartered and sauteed in olive oil. Season. Serve 
in a ring with rice piled in center. Pass grated Parmesan cheese 
in a wooden bowl, with wooden spoon. 

RISOTTO MILANESE STYLE 
(Risotto alia Milanese) 

1 cup rice Salt and pepper 

% onion, minced l /z teaspoon saffron 

*4 cup butter 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 

Yz cup Marsala wine cheese 

Meat broth 

Wash rice through several waters, drain and dry in a towel. 
Slowly fry onion in l / 2 the butter until golden; add rice and fry 



32 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add half the Marsala wine and 
sufficient boiling broth to cook rice; season and cook rapidly until 
grains swell; reduce heat and finish cooking until nearly dry. 
Uncover, add rest of butter and Marsala, and the saffron mixed 
smooth in a little broth. Set over steam or in open oven until 
rice is dry and fluffy. Take up, and sprinkle with Parmesan 
cheese. 

This is the finest of the Milanese risottos and is served on 
special occasions. A little skill is required to cook it properly 
and attain the fluffiness at the end without draining off the 
liquid. 

The rice recipes of the Portuguese, Spaniards and Italians 
bear close resemblance, all of them being of Arabian origin in- 
troduced through North African invasions and occupations. In- 
land cities, like Milan, eat their rice flavored with meats and 
vegetables; coast cities, where sea food is plentiful and fresh, 
prefer the fishy flavors. The combinations are legion; rice with 
chicken giblets, with green peas, with minced veal or pork, with 
frogs' legs, with sea snails, black rice cooked with the inky squid, 
pink rice cooked with crayfish, rice with tench (a sort of 
flounder), with mussels, and with the tiny clams of the Bay of 
Biscay. Invariably the method of cooking differs from that of 
the Far East in that the liquid is a flavoring broth, instead of 
water, and is retained in the finished dish, the quantity being 
gauged so as to be completely evaporated at the end of the cook- 
ing time. Saffron is a frequent flavoring and imparts an ap- 
petizing color. 
r 5 POLENTA— I 

i cup yellow cornmeal 2 cups rich hash of left-over 

1 quart boiling salted water, or meat or fish 

stock 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan 

2 tablespoons butter cheese 



ITALIAN 33 

Sprinkle cornmeal into boiling liquid stirring constantly until 
there are no lumps; cook over slow heat or in double boiler l / 2 
hour, adding butter while cooking. Pour out on a hot platter 
in a ring. Fill the center with hot hash. Sprinkle the mush 
thickly with Parmesan cheese. 

POLENTA— II 

Make cornmeal mush as above; pour a thin layer into a 
buttered baking dish, spread with thick tomato sauce, sprinkle 
with Parmesan cheese. Then another layer of mush, tomato 
sauce, and cheese; repeat, finishing with a layer of cheese. Brown 
in a hot oven (400 F.). Serve with tomato sauce. 

BAKED POLENTA 

Make cornmeal mush as above; let cool and stiffen in a 
shallow mold; slice with a wet knife. Have ready a rich brown 
gravy containing bits of chicken giblets or other tidbits. Place 
a layer of polenta slices in buttered baking dish; add a little 
gravy; sprinkle with grated cheese. Repeat. Cover the top 
with remaining gravy and bake 10 minutes in a hot oven 

( 4 oo°F.). 

FRIED POLENTA 

1 small onion, chopped 1 celery stalk, sliced 

Yl garlic clove, minced 1 green pepper, chopped 

3 tablespoons butter 1 quart boiling water 

l /z pound pork sausage or ham- 1 cup cornmeal 
burger % cup flour 

Salt and pepper 

Fry onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon of the butter for a 
few minutes, add meat and mash it as it fries to keep it from 
cooking in lumps. Turn into a saucepan with celery, pepper 
and boiling water. Let boil, covered, 10 minutes. Season. Add 
the cornmeal a little at a time, stirring out all lumps. Finish 






34 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

cooking over steam, or in double boiler. Cool in a mold. Slice. 
Dredge slices with flour and fry in remaining butter. 

Polenta was originally made of chestnut flour, as its name 
signifies. Then American maize took kindly to the soil and 
climate of Northern Italy and became an important crop. In 
the Fall, ears of corn, with husks turned back, gild the outer 
walls of farm houses and barns and add to the gaiety of the 
rural landscape. The grain is afterward ground in local mills 
as needed, for cornmeal must be fresh to lend its full flavor to 
the daily polenta dish eaten by every family throughout the 
winter. 

The score of polenta recipes range from the simple ones 
given here, to the rich Milanese polenta timbale, which is a thin, 
hollow mold of cold polenta, filled with a thick sweetbread 
ragout made with white wine and a dozen other ingredients, 
baked in the oven, and afterward elaborately garnished.

fish and stir together. Heat butter and when nearly smoking 
pour in the mixture. Stir at first until eggs begin to set. Then 
let brown on bottom, turn like a pancake and brown the other 
side. Slide out of the pan on to a hot platter. Care must be 
taken not to let the eggs get too hard, since the finished dish 
must have the moist consistency of an omelet.

(Carni) 



SCALOPPINE IN GRAVY 

(Scaloppine al Sugo) 

i pound veal steak *4 cup white wine or- Marsala 

2 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper 

i l /z cups veal or beef gravy l / 8 teaspoon nutmeg 

i tablespoon lemon juice 

Have butcher cut veal very thin, divide it in pieces about 3 
inches square and pound each piece very well with the flat side 
of his cleaver. Melt butter, slowly brown veal on both sides, 
add heated gravy and simmer 5 minutes. Add wine, salt, pepper 
and nutmeg. Cover closely and simmer until very tender. 
Sprinkle lemon juice over it. Serve with mashed potatoes or 
chopped spinach. Also, the gravy may be used as a sauce with 
spaghetti or tagliarini served with the scaloppine. 

SCALOPPINE WITH MUSHROOMS 

(Scaloppine con Funghi) 
Same as Scaloppine al Sugo, except that 6 mushrooms are 
cut up and added to the pan while browning. The nutmeg may 
be omitted. (Italians prefer dried mushrooms soaked overnight, 
and these would be preferable to canned mushrooms.) 

SCALOPPINE WITH ZUCCHINI 

(Scaloppine con Zucchini) 
Same as Scaloppine al Sugo, with the addition of zucchini, 
partly sauteed in a separate pan and then put in the pan with 
the veal and simmered with it for 5 minutes.

i very small carrot, chopped i sprig minced parsley or basil 

Y 2 stalk celery, chopped Salt and pepper 

Have butcher prepare veal as for Scaloppine al Sugo. 
Slowly brown veal in oil, add chopped vegetables and continue 
browning for a moment. Add heated gravy and simmer. Add 
wine, parsley, salt and pepper. Simmer until very tender. 
Tomato juice may be substituted for wine. 

LAMB WITH PEAS 
(Agnello con Piselli) 

2 garlic cloves i tablespoon olive oil 
6-8 sprigs rosemary Salt and pepper 

(substitute mint) 2 tablespoons butter 

3 pounds leg of lamb 3 tablespoons tomato paste 
Ys pound salt pork, chopped Meat broth, heated 

3 cups green peas, cooked 

Cut the garlic in tiny slivers; remove leaves from rosemary 
and cut stems in short lengths. With a small pointed instrument 
make insertions all over the meat, and insert, alternately, slivers 
of garlic and bits of stem, leaving the latter sticking out so that 
they may be removed before serving. Lay salt pork, with the 
oil, in an earthenware casserole; heat slowly. Salt and pepper 
the meat and lay on top; commence cooking and when lamb 
is slightly colored all over, add butter and tomato paste, and a 
little of the broth. Cover closely and simmer, turning and add- 
ing more broth if necessary to prevent scorching. When tender, 



4 o THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

add peas. Take up meat and remove rosemary; lay on a hot 
platter, surround with peas, pour strained sauce over, and sprinkle 
sparingly with a few of the finely minced rosemary leaves. 

Veal is cooked in the same manner, substituting parsley for 
rosemary. 

Beef occupies a poor place in the Italian kitchen, being 
usually relegated to the soup pot, for the animals are largely 
useless milk cows, or worn-out work oxen. In the absence of 
modern ovens, meats are deliciously cooked as above, or roasted 
on the spit before an open fire. 

LAMB CUTLETS MILANESE 

4 lamb chops or cutlets from leg l / 2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated 
Salt and pepper i egg, well beaten 

l / 2 cup sifted bread crumbs l A cup butter, melted

and Parmesan cheese. Dip chops in this mixture, then in beaten 

egg. Sprinkle with butter and cook under a slow grill until 

done. 

ROAST KID

2 bay leaves i pound dates, stoned 

2 sprigs thyme Thin slices salt pork 

i blade mace l A cup flour 

Have the kid well cleaned. Put brain, liver and sweetbreads 
in refrigerator, with any other giblets. (Perhaps the kid kidneys 
and chitterlings fancied by the Italians are too highly flavored.) 
Mix all other ingredients, except Marsala, dates, and pork, and 
rub mixture over the kid, inside and out. Set away in a wide 



ITALIAN 41 

crock for a day, turning occasionally. Drain and dry. Strain 
marinating liquid. Prepare giblets, blanching and skinning 
sweetbreads and brains, and skinning liver and kidneys; chop 
them together and season. Chop dates, warm Marsala and pour 
over them. Let stand until wine is absorbed; mix with chopped 
giblets; stuff the kid and sew up. Cut ligaments at the joints; 
fold legs close to body and tie securely. Lay salt pork over 
breast and back and wrap with twine. Place kid in oiled paper 
bag, lay in roasting pan and bake 1 hour, turning every 15 
minutes. Remove paper, add heated marinating liquid to pan 
and finish baking, basting frequently. Remove pork for the 
last 15 minutes. Remove twine. Take up. Thicken gravy with 
flour. If a more delicate flavor is desired, discard marinating 
liquid and finish last basting with pan liquor and l / 2 cup melted 
butter. 

A number of years ago a past-master at the art of kid-roast- 
ing erected the brick beehive oven of his native land in a vacant 
lot just off Mulberry Bend in New York, sheltered it with a 
crude booth, and sold the succulent steaming meat at the dinner 
hour to neighbors, who hurried home with precious plattersful 
for waiting families. Gradually his fame spread, and food 
sophisticates who had lived in Italy began stopping in front of 
the humble shelter, some of them tarrying to consume their 
purchases on the spot, with chunks of crunchy hearth bread 
and black olives. One day an excavator rolled into the lot, and 
the goat cook disappeared. Inquiries at the corner grocery re- 
vealed that he had gone back home to buy the local albergo 
(inn).

in hot oven (400°F.). Turn oil heat and leave until milk is 
absorbed. Uncover and brown under slow grill. Add i cup 
milk to contents of frying pan and thicken with more flour, if 
necessary. Serve this gravy separately. Remove chicken to hot 
platter, and serve with Italian rice combined with the chicken 
giblets. 

This is a specialty of the Alpine regions. The farther South 
one travels in Italy the scarcer cow's milk becomes. Goat's milk 
takes its place in the morning coffee, and cooks do without it 
altogether. The Italian cooking most popular in America and 
England is that of Northern Italy, especially Lombardy and the 
Piedmont, and the majority of Italian restaurant owners and 
their chefs come from these districts. 

CHICKEN A LA MARENGO

wine and broth; cover closely and simmer, turning occasionally 
until tender. Add tomato and simmer 5-10 minutes. Add lemon 
juice and serve. 

This recipe is sometimes attributed to France, sometimes to 
Italy, for its origin is not generally known. 

On the day of Napoleon's victory over the Austrians (1800) 
at Marengo, a little village in the Italian district of Piedmont, 
the cook-wagon did not arrive in time for the hungry Consul 






46 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

and his generals. A hasty repast of young chickens, stolen from 
a peasant, was prepared. The recipe was an invention of the 
moment, and ever since has commemorated Napoleon's military 
prowess. An Italian authority on cooking remarks that no one 
should be led to believe, from this accident, that the Consul 
deserved to have a dish named in his honor.

TOMATO SAUCE 

(Salsa di Pomodoro) 

Pelligrino Artusi, in his "L'Arte di Mangiar Bene," gives the 
classic tomato sauce of Italy thus: 

"Mince together % onion, 1 garlic clove, 1 finger-length of 
celery, several bay leaves, and parsley to taste. Season with a 
little oil, salt and pepper; cut up 7 or 8 tomatoes, and put all 



ITALIAN 53 

together over the fire to cook. Stir now and then, and when 
the sauce is the consistency of cream, strain and serve." 

Artusi illustrates the universal usefulness of this sauce by 
telling an anecdote about a parish priest in a small city in the 
vicinity of Rome. The good father "cacciava il naso per tuto" 
(stuck his nose in everything). Although he was much be- 
loved, his constant meddling eventually won him the nickname 
of Don Pomodoro, or Reverend Tomato, the tomato being the 
chief requisite of every Italian dish.

Lay in a baking pan, sprinkle with salt, paprika and Parmesan 
cheese. Add gravy to pan, bake, and serve hot. Or, if peppers 
are to be eaten cold, heat olive oil in frying pan, add peppers and 
slowly simmer; cool and serve as hors d'oeuvres. 

The simplest method of cooking peppers, in the Italian 
fashion, is to quarter, seed, and season them. Lay them in a 
baking dish with plenty of olive oil, and bake until tender. They 
are good either hot or cold. The pepper-flavored oil left in the 
dish may be used for frying. 

PEPPERS BAKED PLAIN 

Drop peppers into boiling water for 5 minutes, then rub off 
skins. Cut in quarters; remove seeds and veins. Lay in baking

MUSACA 

2 young egg plants l / 2 cup meat gravy 

Salt and pepper \ x / 2 cups strained tomato 

3 eggs Y 2 teaspoon sugar 

i cup sifted bread crumbs l / 2 teaspoon paprika 

i cup butter 2 large ears tender sweet corn 

4 medium-sized onions, sliced (or canned corn) 
3 cups cooked lamb or kid, 3 tablespoons cream 

minced 

Peel egg plants and cut in pieces the size of a thumb. Add 
2 tablespoons salt to saucepan of boiling water, and parboil egg 
plant 10 minutes; drain and dry in a towel; season with pepper. 
Beat 1 egg slightly with 1 tablespoon water; dip egg plant in 
egg and then in crumbs, and fry light brown in butter. Fry 
onions golden in butter; season with salt and pepper. In a 
deep buttered baking dish arrange alternate layers of egg plant, 
onions, and the lamb mixed with gravy, finishing with layer of 
egg plant. Season tomato with salt, sugar, and paprika and 
pour over. Bake in moderate oven (350 F.) 15 to 20 minutes. 
Split down the grains of corn and scrape. Beat remaining 2 
eggs lightly; add cream and beat; add corn, salt and pepper, 
and beat. Pour mixture over contents of baking dish; replace 
in oven, and turn off the heat. After 10 minutes place under 
grill to lightly brown. 

This dish came from the Near East and turns up, with 
changed spelling of the name, in a number of Mediterranean 
countries. The recipe is very adaptable, and can be simplified 
to merely egg plant, onions and tomato sauce. 



ITALIAN 61 

SMOTHERED MUSHROOMS 

l / 2 pound mushrooms V2 garlic clove, crushed 

3 tablespoons olive oil Salt and pepper 

Wash mushrooms, dry in a towel, and cut in halves. Mix 
oil, garlic, and seasonings; pour over mushrooms, and stir. 
Marinate 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Set over a brisk 
fire, cover closely and fry gently, but constantly shaking the pan. 
When they begin to brown reduce heat and let them smother. 
Serve as a garnish, or on toast. 

SALADS 

Italians are constant eaters of fresh salads, including wild 
greens from the fields. They are satisfied with coarser garden 
products than the French, the tangy romaine lettuce being their 
great contribution to the salad course. 

The dressing is always simple, salad being looked upon as 
a refreshing aftertouch to their somewhat heavy meals. Their 
two parts of olive oil to one of wine vinegar produces a sharp 
. sauce, because the vinegar, made from ordinary red wine, is 
highly acid. Romaine, or other lettuce, plain, or with thick slices 
of tomato, onion, fresh or pickled green peppers, and well doused 
with this simple dressing, satisfies the Italian palate. Garlic 
lovers can go the limit in flavoring such hearty salads. 

Cooked or fresh vegetables, seasoned and dipped in olive oil, 
appear on the antipasto platter, but seldom go into the salad 
bowl. 






SWEETS 

(Dolci) 



In Milan a large part of the Italian populace gathers in 
sheltered galleries between shops to sip granite and other lightly 
frozen fruit-juice ices. The Italian partiality for cooling drinks 
dates back to remote antiquity. In Naples and throughout 
Southern Italy snow was early employed for the freezing of all 
sorts of sorbetti (sherbets) as well as for cooling drinks and the 
refrigerating of wines. In the winter season snow was gathered 
from the mountains and stored in spacious underground vaults, 
where it was tightly packed by trampling into a solid mass. 
Open pits in the fields were dug to store the packed snow where 
it remained heavily covered with leaves until wanted. Sawed 
in huge blocks it was taken to the city at night to be used the 
next day. Fancy street stands catered to the aristocracy with 
expensive tumblers of iced cordial, while a penny glass of snow 
water slaked the thirst of the masses. 

ICE CREAMS 

Italian ice creams do not differ essentially from our ice 
creams, except in the use of eggs; usually 6 eggs to i quart 
cream, or 8 to i quart milk; but with few exceptions the juicy 
fruits, such as orange, strawberry, peach, etc., are not combined 
with cream. They are used in water-ices, sherbets and frozen 
fruits.

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM 

% cup boiling water 6 eggs 

l / 2 teaspoon stick cinnamon i l / 2 cups granulated sugar 

5 squares (i-ounce) unsweet- 1 quart cream 
ened chocolate 

Pour boiling water on cinnamon which has been crushed 
and let steep for l / 2 hour. Pour off clear liquid, work it into 
chocolate which has been melted over hot water and keep warm. 
Prepare custard with eggs, sugar and cream in a double boiler. 
Add spiced chocolate. Cool and freeze. Serve with whipped 
cream piled on top. 

For chocolate caramel ice cream add 3 tablespoons of caramel 
in place of cinnamon. 

COFFEE ICE CREAM 

1 quart heavy cream 6 eggs 

3 ounces freshly roasted coffee i l /z cups granulated sugar 

(whole beans) Whipped cream 

Put 1 pint of the cream into a double boiler with coffee 
beans; cover tightly, and let infuse for an hour in warm place 
(water must not boil). Strain through fine muslin into remain- 
ing cream. Make a boiled custard with cream, eggs, and sugar; 
cool, freeze, and serve with whipped cream piled on top.

ALL-FRUITS ICE 

(Gelato de Tutti-Frutti) 

i cup pistachio nuts 4 ounces candied orange peel 

or almonds, blanched Kirsch 

4 ounces candied cherries 1 quart pineapple sherbet 

4 ounces candied apricots 1 quart orange sherbet 

Soak nuts and fruits in kirsch to cover until soft. Spread 

1 pint of pineapple sherbet in a thin layer in the bottom of a 

2 quart mold. Set mold in a mixture of ice and salt. Dice 
fruit and nuts, add to orange sherbet and pack down well on 
first layer. Fill mold to a little above the edge with remaining 
pineapple ice, press lid on tightly, seal joints with a buttered 
strip of muslin, pack in salt and ice and freeze 2 or 3 hours. 

This ice is a general favorite in Italy, each sorbetajo (maker 
of ices) having his own formula. The candied fruits are soaked 
until soft in lemon- and vanilla-flavored syrups; in maraschino, 
kirsch, or any desired liquor. 

Other combinations of fruits are used; pears, figs, angelica, 
preserved ginger and cumquats give a pleasing variety. Almonds, 
pistachios, chestnuts, and hazelnuts soaked in hot syrups until 
soft, and chopped fine, are added to fruits. 

ORANGE GRANITE 

(Granita d'Arancia) 

3 cups orange juice 1 quart water 

2 cups sugar 

About 1 dozen oranges are needed. Peel six of them, remove 
every bit of the white and cut in thin slices; lay these in a dish, 
sprinkle with sugar and let stand 3 to 4 hours to make a rich 
syrup; then drain. Squeeze juice of remaining oranges into 
this. Add water, mix well, and strain into freezer. When half 



ITALIAN 65 

frozen, like wet snow, fill small glasses and serve. These ices are 
delicious but will not stand. 

STRAWBERRY GRANITE 

(Granita di Fragola) 

1% cups strawberry juice 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
2% cups sugar 1 quart water 

Mash berries. 1 heaping quart of ripe berries will suffice. 
Cover with sugar and let stand several hours to form a rich 
syrup. Then strain, add lemon juice and water, put in freezer 
and freeze until mixture has a snowy, frosty look. Serve in tall, 
thin glasses. Raspberry granite is made the same way, sub- 
stituting raspberries for strawberries. Any summer fruit drink 
may be served as a granite if prepared and frozen as above. 

In Italy, France and Spain, wherever freezers are wanting, 
granites are frozen in wide-mouthed water-jugs or bottles. These 
are filled with the fruit mixture, set in ice and salt, and stirred 
with a spatula. As ice forms on the sides it is scraped down 
and mixed with the liquid. 

POMONA SHERBET 

1 quart fresh sweet cider 1 pint orange juice 

3 cups granulated sugar 

Mix well; let stand 2-3 hours, stir thoroughly, then freeze

2-3 hours packed in ice-salt mixture. 



66 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

There are many other excellent combinations; such as pine- 
apple, orange and lemon; strawberry, raspberry and currant; 
grape, with cherry and plum. As these fruit sherbets are made 
without water, they are very rich in body and luscious in taste. 

PINEAPPLE SHERBET 

{Sorbretto di Ananas so) 

i large ripe pineapple i quart water 

2 cups granulated sugar 2 tablespoons lemon juice

BREADS AND CAKES 



CHESTNUT SWEET BREAD 
(Castagnaccio) 

Add to chestnut flour a little salt and sufficient water to make 
a firm dough. Knead in broken walnut meats, bits of blanched 
almonds, raisins, or currants, and form into a round loaf. Cover 
bottom of a frying pan (a copper one is used) with olive oil, 
put in dough, sprinkle top with oil and bake in moderate oven. 
This sweet bread is popular throughout Northern Italy, where 
chestnuts form a good part of the peasant's fare.

beating mixture well after each addition. Stir in flour. Butter 
a long narrow pan. Alternate in it a layer of batter and one of 
fruit until all are used. Bake in a hot oven (375° F.). 

Because Italy is a wine country the early development of 
bread making was through the use of eggs rather than brewer's 

yeast NEAPOLITAN BREAD

Put all ingredients except butter in a bowl and mix well to- 
gether. Work in butter thoroughly. Pour batter about J4 inch 
deep into buttered, lightly floured pan. Bake in a moderate 
oven (350 F.). 

This cake is the foundation of innumerable small fancy and 
large cakes. It is cut into squares, rounds, and any desired shapes, 
and ornamented with icings, meringues, colored jellies, candies, 
nuts, etc. The recipe is doubled for larger cakes. Small fruited 
cakes are made by adding a few raisins or shredded candied fruit 
to batter. Place in buttered patty pans, put on to baking sheet 
covered with a thick layer of ashes and bake in moderate oven. 

NEAPOLITAN CAKE

Put ingredients into a bowl, and work to a smooth dough. 
Knead the dough into a roll the size of a rolling pin, wrap in 
wax paper and leave on ice for 1 hour. Cut roll into 10 or 12 
equal slices. Roll these out in rounds about 7 inches in diameter, 
place in buttered layer-cake tins, trimming to fit; prick well with 
a fork and bake in a moderate oven (350 F.) to a delicate brown. 
When done lay them on a marble slab or table and cover with 
a baking sheet to keep them straight while cooling. Pile in 
tiers with jelly, marmalade or cream filling between layers. 
3-inch rounds may be cut from center of each layer before bak- 
ing, and the hollow filled with whipped cream, flavored and 
sweetened to taste.

ITALIAN 71 

Cook chestnuts on a gridiron over a clear fire until the 
skins will come off easily. Peel and put them into a mortar 
with butter and a little whipped cream. Pound well, then rub 
through a wire sieve, being careful that the puree is not too wet. 
Put puree into a bowl and add sugar, then vanilla, and form 
mixture into small cakes. Put on a buttered baking sheet, make 
a slight incision on top of each, brush over with egg yolk and 
bake in hot oven (400°F.). 

MERINGUE 

2 cups granulated sugar l / 2 teaspoon vanilla or 1 tea-

of moisture that may form on sides of pan and cook without 
stirring until syrup will spin a long thread from tip of spoon. 
Remove, add flavor, and set pan in a bowl of cold water. Beat 
egg whites until stiff but not dry. Pour into syrup. Beat until 
mixture is a cold smooth paste. This is used in making meringue 
shells and fancy small cakes, also for decoration and to com- 
bine with whipped creams and ices; in fact, the Italian chef 
with pastry bag and tube, plus imagination and patience, per- 
forms magic with this paste, which is first cousin to our own 

boiled frosting.

SAGO WINE SAUCE 

2 ounces sago 1 cup claret 

1 cup water Juice of 1 orange 

Yi cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons rum 



80 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Soak sago 2 hours in water, then boil in same water until 
clear, add sugar, claret and orange juice and stir until mixture 
thickens, then add rum. Serve with cereal puddings. 

ROASTED CHESTNUTS 

Make a gash on one side of fine large Italian chestnuts. Put 
them on a pan with a perforated bottom, place over a moderate 
fire and when they are cooked wrap them in a cloth for 10 or 
12 minutes. Serve with salt and butter. 

SUGARED CHESTNUTS 

Roast chestnuts as for the table, remove skins and cut in 
halves. Dip the halves, one at a time, in well-beaten egg white, 
then roll them in powdered sugar and lay on paper in a slow 
oven (250°F.) to dry. Do not touch until dry. 

CHESTNUT AND RAISIN COMPOTE 

(Composto di Frutta) 

1 pound chestnuts i-inch stick cinnamon 

2 teaspoons olive oil % teaspoon allspice 
1 pound Sultana raisins, seeded ! /4 teaspoon cloves 
Juice and grated rind l / 2 lemon l / 2 cup granulated sugar 

Score chestnuts on flat side with sharp knife; parboil 5 
minutes, drain, put in frying pan with olive oil and shake over 
a hot fire for 5 minutes; then remove brown skins with outer 
shells. Cover with salted boiling water, cook gently until tender 
and drain. Put raisins in a bowl with lemon juice and rind 
and spices. Cover with water and simmer over fire until water 
is nearly absorbed. Add sugar, mix in chestnuts and cook until 
well blended. 



ITALIAN 81 

PEACH COMPOTE 

6 ripe peaches i cup red wine 

6 tablespoons powdered sugar i-inch stick cinnamon 

i teaspoon grated lemon peel 

Pare and slice peaches, sprinkle with powdered sugar and 
set aside. Put wine, cinnamon, and lemon peel into a pan, boil 
4 or 5 minutes and strain over peaches. Cover and let stand 2 
hours before serving. 

FIGS ROMAN STYLE 

(Fiches alia Romano) 

Line individual bowls with split lady ringers. Put in bottom 
of each a layer of vanilla ice cream, then place a ripe fig, peeled 
and quartered, over cream. Sprinkle over with Marsala, cover 
with a maraschino sauce, and dust with powdered macaroons. 
Serve bowls in plates of ice. 

Judging from the wealth of figs in Italy the Garden of 
Eden must have been located there. Italian figs range in size 
from tiny plums to mammoth peaches and in color all the way 
from black to white. The greens, purples and reds are especially 
delicious. Placed side by side in accordance with the spectrum, 
they form a radiant and appetizing rainbow of both taste and 
color, for each variety has a flavor as distinctive as its hue. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI CONSERVE 

Use a wide-mouthed gallon jar, either porcelain or glass, 
with a tight-fitting cork. Put in i pint of brandy and add fruits, 
following the season. Start with strawberries, and to every 
pound of fruit add i pound of sugar. Put fruit in when fresh 
and stir with wooden spoon. Remove hulls and stems from 
berries, remove pits from all pitted fruits; plums, peaches, and

apricots should also be pared. Grapes must be seeded, but the 
skins may be left on or not, according to taste. When the last 
fruit is added, let stand for a week, then it is ready to use. Keep 
jar well corked, except when putting in fruit and stirring. Keep 
in a cool, dry place. The juice makes excellent pudding sauce. 
Add a little water and thicken. It also is a fine accompaniment 
to fruit ice creams and of course the brandied fruit jazzes up a 
tutti-frutti ice. 

ITALIAN COTTAGE CHEESE 

(Formaggio) 

7 tablespoons powdered sugar 2 tablespoons Marsala wine 

Juice 3 lemons 1 quart cream 

Mix sugar, lemon juice and wine in a bowl. Add cream, 
beating in a little at a time. Whip until mixture is quite thick. 
It will take about 30 minutes. Lay a muslin cloth over a hair 
sieve and pour in cream. Let stand 12 hours and drain; then 
turn out and garnish with flowers. 

This dessert combines deliciously with a wine dinner. 



WINES 

(Vinos) 



OF WINES 

Non in solo pane vivit homo 
(Man does not live by bread alone) 

This ancient saying is especially suited to the Italians, for 
they lead the world in the quantity of wine drunk with meals. 
The French, of course, pay more attention to vintage and quality 
and though on occasion they do serve champagne in half gallon 
magnums and full gallon Jeroboams, these are nothing in size, 
compared to the demijohns, nay carboys, of Italian Chianti that 
hold five and ten gallons apiece. Such giant bottles are used at 
parties and even then there's not enough to go around. In wine- 
drinking, as in everything else, the French are thrifty and serve 
un quart (J4 litre, approximately 54 P mt ) with the table d'hote, 
but the Italians are world-record spendthrifts of red ink. In 
the famed red-wine section of Tuscany, where a lunch of wine, 
cheese and bread is usually taken right in the wine shop itself, 
the festive straw-covered bottle is as big and round as a bowling 
ball and holds about three quarts, which is just twelve times 
as much as the customary tumbler-full of France. The Tuscany 
measure is called a fiasco and one is allotted to each individual, 
although he needn't drink it all, for after the finger bowl is 
served, the cameriere (waiter) removes the bottle, accurately 
gauges the amount consumed and charges accordingly. This 
fiasco, whose name has nothing to do with "failure" as we use 
it, is an oddity among bottles, because it has neither cork nor 

83 



84 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

stopper of any kind. It is sealed air tight by a small quantity 
of olive oil floated in on top and when the wine is required for 
drinking this is blotted up with absorbent waste or neatly 
tossed out of the neck. Before cork came to Italy from Spain 
a piece of tow dipped in oil was the original stopper. 

This ancient duchy of Tuscany includes the romantic old 
towns of Florence and Siena, celebrated down the centuries 
for climate and vineyards that combine to produce the great 
Chiantis and Ruflnas. Its other red wines are Artiminio, Car- 
mignana, Montalbano, Monte Pulciano, Montalcino and Monte 
Argentario. The red muscat wine of Aleatico is the sweetest 
of the lot, it is more purple than red and therefore called nero, 
(black). Jvlonte Pulciano is the best known produce of Aleatico, 
but it has serious rivals in Monte Catini, Val de Rievole and 
Ponte a Moriano. The wines of this whole province usually 
appear with the entree and are drunk straight through the meal. 
The two outstanding whites of Tuscany are Elba and Pomino, 
and the famed Est, Est, Est is grown nearby. There used to be 
a greenish vintage, too, Verdea of Arcetri, near Florence, which 
was the favorite beverage of Frederick the Great. 

The story of Est, Est, Est has been told many times, though 
probably never before in a cook book. A German prelate, Bishop 
Fuger, liked this white wine so well that he drowned himself 
in it, by consuming flagon after flagon. It seems that this 
bibulous clergyman, before undertaking a trip from his Prussian 
parish to pay his respects to the Pope at Rome, sent a courier 
ahead to spot Italian taverns where he could be sure of getting 
the best wine. The advance agent was to chalk the word "Est," 
it is, or this is it, on the door of the inns that would best suit 
the Bishop, but when he came to a little village between Florence 
and Rome he found such a surpassing tipple that he wrote 
Est! Est! Est! Here it is! This is it! Oh, Bishop! So when 
the Reverend Fuger got there and found the nectar simply great, 



ITALIAN 85 

he just relaxed and polished off so much Est! Est! Est! that he 
died before reaching Rome, and his tomb-stone is still in the 
vicinity to prove it. 

Another remarkable white wine is that of Orvieto, which 
also comes in red and is sold at every railroad station in dis- 
tinctive squat bottles. Trebbiano is a golden juice made, as is 
the remarkable Chateau d'Yquem of France, from grapes 
gone too far raisinward perhaps to be eaten, yet all the more 
luscious when fermented. Other regional aristocrats come from 
the old ducal estates of Artimino and of Carmignano. There 
are as well distinctive wines of Nipozzano and Altomena. This 
finishes off the Tuscany types worthy of being bottled for sale, 
but there are countless others unclassified, mere vino del paese 
or table wines, on draught in all wine shops. 

In the foothills of the Alps, Piedmont provides sparkling 
Asti, the Italian champagne, Bosca, and Chaumont. Turin turns 
out a good many pipes of wine both white and red, but they're 
not so hot. Yet the Grignolinos, Freisas, Barberas, Nebiolos and 
Barolos, both still and spumanti (sparkling) uphold the whole 
Province. There are the white wines, as well; Gavi, Cortese and 
Castel Tagliolo, which precede the entree at table and go well 
with antipasto and fish. 

Such a paralyzing variety of sound wines that the best we 
can do without writing a whole book on the subject is to list a 
few noted vintages under their chief centers of consumption: 

Rome: Frascati (white, served with the entree), Marino, 
Genzano and the muscatels of Albano and Montefiascone. 

Naples : Falerno, Vesuvio, Gragnano and the strong Lacrima 
Christi, "tears of Christ," celebrated for centuries, so the genuine 
is hard to get. Lacrima Christi is grown on Mount Vesuvius 
and goes up to 18% in alcoholic content, but its regional neigh- 
bors, Gallipoli and Taranto, go even higher, up to 25%. Naples 



86 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

gets credit, too, for the straw-colored and strawberry-hued island 
wines of Capri. 

Venice: reds: Valpolicella, Bardolino and Cabernet Pinot; 
whites, The Soave of Verona and Terralba of Padua. Since the 
war the fine Bolzano and Merano wines of Austria have been 
added to the wine-producing territory dominated by Venice. 

Lombardy: this Province produces reds exclusively and they 
are generally astringent and of little value: Inferno, Broni and 
Grumello are among the best. 

Sardinia: The Malvasia dessert wines of Garnaccia, Monai 
and Caunona are golden and delicate. Rosso del Campidano is 
the best red wine produced on the island. 

Sicily is noted for its Marsala, perfect both for drinking and 
cooking. Its table wines, of which Corvo di Casteldaccia is 
chiefly exported, are stronger than most; Terre Forte originally 
bottled by Benedictine monks on the slopes of Mount Etna was 
said to be 30% alcohol. Perhaps the fiery strength of these 
vintages comes from the extinct volcanoes on which they are 
grown, for surely those from tame mountain-sides are milder. 

Sicily supplies a good many dessert wines, the muscatels, or 
moscatos, of Salento and Zucca, as well as the sanctified Vino 
Santo. But Marsala is its greatest contribution; amber-colored 
and excellent for cooking, in taste it resembles sherry, or sherry 
and malaga mixed; but since it is reinforced with brandy before 
being shipped, it is pretty heady for drinking purposes. 

The scarcity and impurity of water throughout Italy is, of 
course, responsible for the great consumption of wine. When 
an Italian travels he doesn't think of drinking water, so the 
railroad stations are stocked with wines and the big ships 
equipped with glass wine vats as large as swimming pools, filled 
to the brim with red and white wine. 

The little water that is drunk in Italy is bottled at celebrated 
springs, such as San Pellegrino and Fonte Bracca. Beer has 



ITALIAN 87 

become increasingly popular since Italy took over great hunks 
of Austria, including Trieste. But unless imported from Munich 
or Pilsen, it's hardly worth mentioning. 

As we have seen, some Italian wines are sufficiently strong 
to serve as hard drinks in themselves; and since a hot climate 
is not inducive to schnapps, we find comparatively little native 
brandy drunk. This is called Grappa, not because of the grape 
from which it is distilled, as we might guess, but after Monte 
Grappa, a mountain on the Austrian border, where Italy begins 
to shiver in winter. 

Of aperitifs the most popular is Cinzano, or Martini and 
Rossi vermouth, from which our own Martini cocktail got its 
name. Both of these are aged white Sicilian wines doctored up 
with bitters or herbs, and because they are sweeter than the 
French vermouths they do not serve so well in exciting the 
appetite. Fernet Branca is another life-saver of this sort, and 
there are other tonic mixtures of wine and quinine, called 
Quinados. 

In a fascist country we expect regimentation, but the only 
strait-jacketing of drinks is the standardization of Strega as 
the national liqueur. It is distilled of oranges and comes in two 
colors, one sweet and the other sweeter. Maraschino made in 
Dalmatia from the celebrated cherries must now be classed, 
through conquest, among the Italian distillations, although it 
bears no relation to them and is properly a teutonic kirschwasser, 
though much more syrupy.

SALUD E PESETAS! 

(Health and money! — A Spanish toast) 



The daily menu for a Spanish caballero, or gentleman, might 
as well be put down under drinks, for the Spaniard rises late 
and has a pony of liqueur with his chocolate, wine with his lunch, 
manzanilla (light sherry) before his late dinner, wine again with 
that, a nightcap of brandy and so to bed. 

Desayuno, early breakfast; chocolate or coffee, usually with 
anise liqueur, of which the French anisette is a sweeter imita- 
tion. There are a score of brands of anise, each with its in- 
dividual flavor, but Anis del Mono, with the monkey grinning 
on the label, is an old standby likely to best please the American 
palate. 

Chocolate takes the lead of coffee, and it is as thick as custard 
because it is mixed with cornstarch. Usually this is accompanied 
by a sugar-coated lady finger. The chocolate has to be eaten with 
a spoon, for it doesn't run fast enough to drink. Ferdinand 
Cortez brought the first chocolate beans from Mexico, so Spain 
drank it before any other European country, although she doesn't 
yet know how to make it. Rolls, plain or topped with sugar, 
all of them delicious, are preferred to the lady fingers at break- 
fast. The Spanish, like all other people except Orientals and 
Americans, are master bread makers. Their loaves are the 
whitest and finest knit of any in the world, and also the most 
fancifully twisted and braided. 

The matter of butter is optional in Spain. Most of it is 
imported in tins from Scandinavia, and since little ice is used, 
breakfast butter is often more liquid' than the chocolate itself. 

98 



SPANISH 99 

As in Italy and France, this light morning refreshment is 
partaken of unceremoniously at home or in the cafes, often stand- 
ing instead of sitting at a table. Its simplest Spanish form is 
chocolate, with a chalice of anise and a strong cigarette, for 
tobacco is a government monopoly, as in Italy and France, so 
the smokes are pretty poor. Here again Spain got first chance 
at tobacco, when Columbus himself, and not Sir Walter Raleigh, 
brought it back from America; but the original tobacco has 
slipped as sadly as the chocolate. 

Almuerzo, Luncheon: This comes in countless courses and 
is a slow, dragging affair with plenty of time between for drink, 
discussion and digestion. Since Spain, from Cadiz to Barcelona, 
is a country devoted to chicken and eggs, they are written all 
over the Lista de Platos (bill of fare), though usually chicken is 
served only with the dinner at night. One set rule of the 
Almuerzo is that the first dish served consists of eggs, either 
plain — al plato; poached — estrellados; boiled — passado por agua; 
cooked with peas or hash; served sailor style; or the classic 
Spanish omelet, which is varied by tortilla con esparragos (as- 
paragus omelet) ; tongue omelet, tortilla of brains, spinach 
omelet, artichoke, mushroom, omelet of anything and every- 
thing. There are more egg dishes in the Spanish cuisine than 
in all the others put together. When a Spaniard is parted from 
his eggs his whole spirit sags, so on a trip abroad he will first 
learn the foreign word for egg y and in an emergency, whether 
in Paris or Berlin, he will draw a painstaking picture of the hen- 
fruit to explain to the waiter exactly what he wants, for this is 
his esperanto of lunching. 

The second course is fish, cod being most in favor, as it is in 
Portugal. Eels are also esteemed, and so are squid, cooked in 
their own ink. But in Sevilla the large gold fish, dorado, which 
is a kind of carp and can be seen glinting in the Guadaliquivir 
River, reflecting Columbus' Tower of Gold, appears on the table 



ioo THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

at noon, often with Diamante, a white wine not unlike Sauterne. 
The delicious dorado is served smothered in the famous Andalu- 
sian shrimpy fish sauce. 

Third course, like as not bifes, small fried beef steaks, first 
pounded thin as scallopini in Italy, and as popular, too. The 
Spanish conquest can be traced by its trail of bifes left behind 
to become almost the national dishes of Mexico, Central and 
Southern America. Sometimes the beef is stewed instead, with 
a handful of pitted olives or mushrooms. Here the clarete or 
Rioja, mellow red wine, gets into play, plain but salubrious vino 
tinto, red ink. 

Fourth, some national delicacy, perhaps the classic smoked 
ox tongue, though usually game, for pheasant, quail, pigeon, and 
reed birds are cheap and plentiful in every market. Mostly they 
are cooked in wine, since nearly everything is vinous in Hispana. 
Ordinary white wine is used for cooking here, although Spanish 
sherry and Malaga often take its place abroad. 

By now the luncheon pastime of wine-bibing settles down 
to serious drinking when a bottle of Marques de Riscal of a 
good year is brought out of its cellar bin, jacketed in ancient dust. 
It is carefully uncorked by the mozo (waiter), the cork passed 
around and smelled by the guests, the glass held to the light 
for color, judicially sampled by most of the five senses and 
finally drunk off with gusto, for that is the mainspring of 
gustatory pleasure in Spain. Where the national thirst is said 
to be "inestinguible" — quenchless. The larder may be excellent, 
but the cellar must be superb. 

Though Spain is known abroad chiefly for its sherry, this is 
scarcely drunk at all at home. It is doctored up for foreign con- 
sumption and drunk at its best in England, as is Portuguese 
port. The Spaniard himself prefers a light unfortified white 
sherry. This is the manzanilla of Sanlucar and is drunk quite 



SPANISH 101 

young, after two or three years in the bottle; but it has a taste 
so peculiar that nobody but dyed-in-the-wool Andalusians really 
relish it. In Sevilla an afternoon hour is set aside for its drink- 
ing, which we shall come to presently, after finishing with the 
table wines served at both lunch and dinner. 

Cadiz is the center for sherry, and Malaga of course for the 
wines of that name; but Alicante is the general wine-center, 
much as Bordeaux is in France, or Mayence in Germany, for 
through the port of Alicante a number of types are exported 
from the provinces of Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia. The 
wines drunk with Spanish meals usually are those produced 
nearest at hand, and mostly they go by the name of the province 
or section, such as Riota, in which they are produced, so a short 
summary of these will give the entire viniculture of the country: 

Alicante: Both red and white wines, produced from a vine 
locally called "tintilla," which furnishes most of the juice 
throughout Spain and gives rise to the generic name of tinto 
for the national wine. The white wine of this region is not 
notable. Both white and red are perishable, but the red is 
so full in flavor and rich in color that formerly it was forti- 
fied with spirits and shipped as imitation port wine. 

Andalusia: Rota, best drunk young. This is a vino tinto, red 
wine, from the tintilla vine of Alicante. The English corrupt 
tinto to tent, of which they import a good deal, for it is the 
outstanding red wine of this province. 

White wines of Moguro, Niebla, Rancio and Seville. 

Sherry at Zeres de la Frontera, shipped as "oloroso," 
"amoroso," "vino de pasto" and "amontillados" of varying 
ages and dryness. 

Aragon: Full bodied, rich in color, sunny of flavor. Carinena 
is light red and exquisite. 



102 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Basque : The staunch wine of the Basques is produced in great 
quantity and mostly drunk at home. (See note on the 
Basque kitchen.) 

Catalan : Beautiful wines, shipped to South America and known 
in England as Catalan or Spanish Port. As popular as Ali- 
cante in the Spanish wine-shops, of which there is a chain 
called Bodegas in London. 

Castile: La Mancha is a classic brand, light in color and won- 
derful in bouquet. The Muscatel of Juencaral is exceptional. 
Grand wines also of the Tagus, from Arganda del Rey, 
North of Madrid, to Talavera, de la Reyna. 

Ciudad Real : Val del Penas, sweet white wines and reds strong 
in alcohol, popular in the nearby capital, Madrid. 

Cordoba: Montilla wines, and Manzanilla, which is Amontil- 
lado sherry when aged. 

Galicia : The excellent Rivadavia and Tuy. 

Granada: Marvellous Malagas, heavy sweet dessert wines that 
keep a century and grow drier with age. Malagas are also 
tinctured with bitters, chiefly quinine, and bottled under the 
name of Quinados, which make splendid aperitifs. 

There are three grape crops a year at Malaga; the first 
is made into raisins, the second into a dry white wine con- 
sumed locally, and the third into the several types to which 
we are accustomed, varying from common muscatel to the 
extraordinary Tears of Christ made from the first drippings 
of the grape. 

The mellow Paj arete of Ronda is another celebrity in the 
Malaga section. 

Mallorca: This now touristy isle was formerly famed for its 
excellent malvasias. 



SPANISH 103 

Minorca : Alba Flora, white and light, celebrated for its bouquet. 
Alcyor, dark red and distinguished, but never exported 
because, like some people, it can't stand a sea voyage. 

Murcia: Ordinary rough reds, of which Cartagena is the best. 

Navarra : Roncesvalles, and others little known abroad, because 
of the great home demand. 

Rioja: Four types, Alta Rioja, Baja Rioja, Alauesa and the 
widely known Haro. 

Tarragone: Tasty ruby-red Prioratos. 

Valencia : Red dry wines, chiefly distilled into a brandy, sweeter 
than the French. 

Now, having partaken of sufficient wine, the luncheon is 
finished with postres (dessert) the standard one being custard 
(eggs again), for after alcohol sweets are not relished. Cheese 
and fruit are more generally served, the cheese nothing to brag 
about, but the native fruits good, especially Seville oranges, which 
the English import for their marmalade. Tangerines, wonder- 
ful nectarines, Valencian melons, Malaga raisins, grapes, Jordan 
almonds, preserved watermelon rind. 

Each district in Spain has its cheese specialty, made from 
the milk of cows, goats, or sheep. There is the smoky product 
of San Simon; the fresh, curdy, La Montana cheese; the tetilla, 
soft and buttery, of Galicia; Cabrales, a sharp, fermented cheese; 
Mancha cheese, wrapped in straw and soaked in oil, too rich to 
be eaten without wine; Burgos cream cheese, and a host of less 
renowned varieties. 

The entire cheese is brought to the table, to be cut according 
to taste, and is an invariable course at the mid-day meal. Cheese 
is never served at a formal Spanish dinner. 

The coffee is black and bitter, but the assortment of liqueurs 



104 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

quite good, with anise always in the ascendant. Anise to the 
Spaniard is much the same as kummel to the German or 
absinthe to the French. All three of these ardent infusions bear 
a resemblance in taste. 

Soup is never served at luncheon, except when it comprises 
the whole meal, as does olla podrida, the national cocida, called 
either soup or stew, but in any case a full meal (see recipe). 
Though nearly everything goes into this olla, the chick peas or 
garbonzas are its characteristic feature. The dish is sometimes 
called just garbonzas, as we say "beans" for food. Next to 
chicken and eggs, Spain is distinguished for its chick peas and 
rice appetite, and this Spanish influence has left its impress on 
conquered Spanish American countries, where many national 
dishes consist of either chick peas or chicken. 

Between lunch and dinner, about the time a Londoner takes 
his tea (which often as not consists of whiskey and soda) the 
Sevillano drinks his manzanilla. This young sherry is known 
to us only as the pickle in which the olives of Seville are bottled. 
There is a natural affinity between olives and manzanilla, for 
both are acquired tastes and share a similar tang. 

After the bull fight all of masculine Seville pours into the 
bodegas. In the expensive ones the white sherry is served in a 
nickeled tray with compartments holding six tiny glasses for one 
drinker. Another boxed tray is served with it, loaded with ap- 
petizers, each in its separate compartment and sometimes there 
are twelve of these; an anchovy curled around a caper or a 
pickled nasturtium seed, a tiny pickled oyster, a dab of white 
bait, ingenious pickles, boiled shrimp, a shaving of raw ham, 
empanadillas, little meat pies, and special olives unknown out- 
side Andalusia. Elaborate, intricate taste-teasers, no two alike. 

Those who can't afford this Sevillian luxury fill the humbler 
wine shops, where a tumbler of tinto or Rioja wine costs just 
two cents. But mostly, after a bull fight, more fiery drinks are 



r 



SPANISH 105 

called for — Matta Rattas, for example, a mighty concoction of 
anise from which Hemingway could just as well have got his 
title "Death in the Afternoon," although the name loosely trans- 
lates "kills rats." 

Dinner is at nine o'clock, and is just an amplification of 
lunch, with thick soup first, made of oysters, birds or almonds, 
though sometimes merely panada, boiled bread. Then fish or 
omelet; next pheasant, squab, hare, or at least chicken, maybe 
all four. There are sure to be artichokes or asparagus, but neither 
salad nor butter. The dessert is an elaborate ice, grapes, or gal- 
letas, sweet biscuits that go well with a final glass or two of 
dessert wine. 

In this male country the men usually take after-dinner cofifee 
and liqueurs at a cafe, with a game of dominoes and a chalice 
of Pedro Domencq brandy, while the women remain patiently 
at home. 



SOUPS AND STEWS 

(Sopas y Cocidos) 



ROYAL SOUP 
(Sopa Real) 

4 hard-boiled eggs i quart clear vegetable soup 

l / 2 lemon 

Mash the egg yolks and mince the whites. Add the soup. 
Bring to a boil, drop in small bits of lemon and serve. 

The broth of the cocido (see recipe) plays the same part in 
Spanish soup-making as does consomme in the French cuisine, 
or the stock pot in the English kitchen. In every Spanish house- 
hold the cocido is cooked every day, either an elaborate one to 
be served to the family or a simple one for the servants' table; 
so the clear vegetable soup, rich and highly seasoned, as required 
in this recipe, is always at hand. 

Tinned vegetable soup, fortified with a teaspoon of beef 
extract and additional seasoning to taste, strained, cleared with 
white of egg and strained through a cloth, is a practical substi- 
tute. 

SEED BROTH 

(Caldo Semilla) 

4 tablespoons wheat 4 tablespoons chick peas 

4 tablespoons corn 4 tablespoons dry kidney beans 

4 tablespoons barley 3 quarts cold water 

Salt or sugar 

Roast the grains and beans in the oven like coffee beans and 
pound fine in a mortar or run through the coffee mill. Put into 

106 



SPANISH 107 

3 quarts of cold water and simmer until only 1 quart of liquid 
is left. Strain and press through a sieve. Season with salt or 
sugar and serve hot or cold. 

The main distinction between Spanish cooking in the mother 
country and that of her colonial descendants is a sparing use 
of hot pepper. This soup, for instance, has no pepper ingredient. 
Fresh, sweet, red and green pimentos are used in appetizing 
profusion during their season, while strings of them, drying for 
winter use, hang from eaves and rafters; but there is not a 
really hot or peppery recipe in the cuisine of Spain, with the 
exception of red-peppered hard sausages such as chorizo. 

COLD MILK SOUP J 
(Sop a de Lee he Frio) 

3 pints whole milk Juice 1 lemon 

3 e gg whites Grated rind of Y 2 lemon 

Powdered sugar 

Bring milk to boiling point, stirring constantly. Pour into a 
colorful, decorative serving bowl, cool, and place in refrigerator. 
Whip egg whites with lemon juice and grated lemon rind, 
adding enough sugar to make a light snowy cream. Spread this 
thinly and evenly over the cold cooked milk and leave in re- 
frigerator l / 2 hour before serving 

For delicate supping a plain custard suits every Latin palate. 
So this custardy soup, being but slightly sweetened, makes an 
appetizing introduction to a Spanish supper, or, as so many 
other national dishes, it is a whole meal in itself. Fresh cow's 
milk is scarce in southern Spain, so this soup would more often 
than not be made of goat's milk, and all the richer for that. 



io8 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

FROGS LEG SOUP 

(Caldo de Ronas) 

i fresh pear 3 sprigs parsley 

Y 2 head lettuce 18 frogs legs 

1 turnip Salt 

1 quart tepid water 

Peel, core and slice the pear. Chop lettuce, turnip and 

parsley. Skin and clean frogs legs, salt and add tepid water with 

first ingredients. Bring to a boil and skim well. Cook for 45 

minutes. 

FISH SOUP 

(Sopa de Fez) 

3 onions 1 cup cooking wine 

3 teaspoons olive oil i l / 2 pounds fresh fish 

3 tablespoons tomato paste Salt 

1 herb bouquet 3 peppercorns, crushed 

1 teaspoon minced parsley Nutmeg 

2 teaspoons flour 4 small cucumber pickles 

3 pints water Small squares fried bread 

Brown onions in the oil, add the tomato paste, herb bouquet 
and parsley and stir in the flour. Add the water and wine and 
stir until smooth. Let simmer l / 2 hour and add the fish. Cook 
30 minutes longer and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. 
Slice the pickles in rings and place them with fried bread in a 
tureen. Pour over them the strained fish broth and serve very 
hot. 

The herb bouquet of Spain varies with the caprice of the 
cook. A soup bouquet consists of a bay leaf, a sprig of celery, 
another of thyme, or sage, tarragon, marjoram, or basil; some 
chives or a scallion; and, more often than not, a strip of sweet 
or semi-hot pepper. Every housewife keeps on hand a catholic 
variety of garden herbs hanging from the rafters of her kitchen, 



SPANISH 109 

keeping company with the strings of bright peppers, and strings 

of onions and garlic held together by braiding their dried stems. 

Her roof will be decorated also during the summer months 

with pumpkins, figs and almonds drying under the sun's hot 

FIFTEEN-MINUTE SOUP 
(So pa al Cuarto de Hora) 

24 almonds Vi cup minced ham 

5 cups beef broth 2 hard-boiled eggs, sliced 

1 cup almond water Salt 

l / 2 cup raw white fish % teaspoon white pepper 

1 cup cooked lobster 1 teaspoon saffron 

l /i cup cooked peas % cup rice 
Sprigs of parsley 

Blanch almonds and add to the meat broth 1 cup of water 
in which they were blanched. Add the fish and lobster, each 
cut in small pieces, the peas, ham, eggs, the salt, pepper and 
saffron. Grind almonds and add. Put in the rice as soon as the 
broth boils and cook 25 minutes. Serve with a sprig of parsley 
in each plate. This makes 4 portions. 

This quick quarter-hour soup is a favorite restaurant dish 
in Seville, where many specialties are cooked to order and hence 
the meal is tediously slow. Dining in Spanish restaurants is 
apt to be disappointing, because of the numerous courses and 
long intervals between. There is a tendency, too, to ape French 
cooking, so this great cuisine hasn't the reputation that it de- 
serves. It is found at its best, of course, in home kitchens and 
at family dinners presided over by the lady of the house who, 
indeed, seldom dines in restaurants, and this may be another 
reason why the commercial meals of the country are found want- 
ing, while those served in the home are superb. 



no THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

ECONOMICAL, OR POOR MAN'S SOUP 
(Sopa Economicd) 

l / 2 pound veal i marrow bone 

3 carrots i herb bouquet 

i parsnip i sprig parsley 

i onion i tablespoon salt 

i ham bone 4 peppercorns 

Cut veal in small pieces, slice the carrots, parsnip and onion. 
Put all in a deep kettle, add bones, the herb bouquet, parsley, 
salt and pepper, and cover well with cold water. Bring slowly 
to a boil and simmer for 3 hours. 

SOUP WITH NOODLES 

{Sopa de Pastas) 

The Spanish are partial to simple strained broths with various 
paste compositions in them. These pastes were formerly made 
in the home, but are now commercially prepared. They in- 
clude macaroni, spaghetti, vermicelli, alphabet and other small 
fancy shapes. The soup is brought to boiling point before the 
pastas are dropped in, and it is not touched during the 10 to 15 
minutes necessary for the paste to cook. 

VEGETABLE SOUP 
(Potaje) 

1 pint fresh kidney beans 1 onion, minced 

5 pints boiling water 1 small stick cinnamon 

2 tablespoons olive oil 5 peppercorns, crushed 
2 cloves garlic, minced % bay leaf 

2 tomatoes, chopped Triangles of fried bread 

1 lemon, sliced 

Cover the beans with the boiling water, and bring to a slow 
boil. Heat oil in a saucepan, and fry garlic until light brown. 



SPANISH in 

Add the tomatoes, and when all is bubbling add to the simmer- 
ing beans; then add onion, cinnamon, peppercorns, and bay leaf* 
Cook slowly over a low fire 2 hours. Strain through colander, 
season with salt, and serve with triangles of fried bread and 
lemon slices. 

Olive oil and garlic are requisites for many Spanish dishes, 
and many are the ways of handling them. If the cook wishes to 
diminish the taste of the oil she heats it until it smokes, then 
cools it1>lightly before proceeding with the cooking. The remain- 
ing flavor is deliciously nutty, with all the acrid quality of the 
olives removed. 

The prejudice which has grown up against the use of garlic 

may be attributed to the careless cooks who leave it half -raw in 

the finished food. Well-cooked garlic has none of the odor of 

the fresh cloves, or "teeth," as the Spanish quaintly call them. 

If you wish its presence to be unsuspected, cut the garlic in half 

instead of mincing it, and remove the halves after they have 

served their purpose of imparting a delicate almondy flavor to 

the dish. 

GARLIC SOUP 

(So pa de A jo) 

% cup olive oil 3 pints boiling water 

6 garlic cloves, minced 3 slices bread 

4 garlic cloves, crushed 3 hard-boiled eggs, sliced 

Slowly fry in oil the minced and crushed garlic cloves until 
golden brown, but not burned. Add a little water and cook 
until tender. Mash, and add boiling water, stirring well. Season 
to taste. Cook 10 minutes. Heat oil in frying pan until it 
smokes. Cool a little and fry bread. Place bread in the bottom 
of a hot soup tureen. Pour soup over the bread and put slices 
of hard-boiled eggs on top. Serve very hot. 

This soup is as popular in Castile as onion soup is in Paris. 



ii2 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

SNOW SOUP 

(Sopa de Nieve) 

3 tablespoons butter i pint hot milk 

i quart boiling water 2 eggs 

1 slice toast Salt 

3 large potatoes, peeled Pepper 

Melt the butter in a sauce pan, add the boiling water, the 
toast cut fine and potatoes. Cook until the potatoes are nearly 
done, then add the hot milk. Continue cooking until the potatoes 
are tender, then press the contents of the sauce pan through a 
colander and return to the pan. Bring to a boil and remove from 
fire. Beat the egg yolks with a little cold water and add them 
to the soup. Whip the whites until stiflf, but not dry, and add 
them little by little, to the boiling hot soup, continuing to beat. 
Season to taste and serve. 

THICK SOUP OF LIVER 

(Chanfaina) 

1 calf's liver Salt, whole black peppers 

1 pig's liver Cloves, cinnamon, caraway 

Olive oil Saffron 

1 large onion, minced Spearmint sprigs 

1 green pepper, minced Parsley 

l / 2 cup bread crumbs, toasted 

Boil livers in enough salted water to serve for finished soup. 
When tender, dice them and save the liquor. Put enough olive 
oil in an earthenware soup pot to brown the diced liver with 
onion, pepper and all seasonings, adding the liver liquor gradu- 
ally. When done it will be as thick as porridge. Sprinkle with 
bread crumbs and serve hot or cold. 

This is only one of half a dozen traditional thick soups, 
celebrated in Andalusian song and story. It is so thick that it 



SPANISH 113 

serves as a whole meal. The original version of this poor man's 
potage calls for lights and the "innards" of any animal, as well 
as pig's liver, according to Latin taste for all sorts of giblets that 
we disdain. 

When made with goose-giblets and rice it is called gondingo. 

ALMOND SOUP 

(Sopa de Almendras) 

8 ounces almonds, blanched 1 clove 

s and peeled 1 dash grated nutmeg 

1 pint rich chicken broth 1 bit mace 

1 pint rich veal broth 1 sprig thyme 

1 tablespoon minced ham Salt (sparingly) 

Grind 6 ounces almonds to paste, adding a few drops cold 
water to prevent oiling. Shred remaining almonds. Mix broths, 
add remaining ingredients, and simmer l / 2 hour; strain, add 
ground almonds and let boil up, stirring with a wooden spoon 
10-15 minutes until well mixed. Add shredded almonds and 
serve. This soup is greatly improved by the addition of l / 2 cup 
scalded cream at the moment of serving. 

CHESTNUT PUREE 

{Sopa de Castahas) 

1 pound chestnuts 2 quarts water 

1 celery stalk l / 2 cup boiling milk 

Y 2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons butter 

3 peppercorns, crushed Croutons 

Cut an X on the shell of each chestnut and put into boiling 
water for a few minutes. Peel and skin, cut in two, and place 
in a casserole with the celery, salt, and pepper. Cover with 2 
quarts of water and cook slowly until tender; then pass all 
through a colander. Return to the casserole, and clear with the 
boiling milk. Add the butter and pour into a soup tureen, over 
croutons. 



ii4 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

RAGOUT 
(Guisado) 

Any game soup cooked with onions, tomatoes and garlic 
first browned in a sauce pan. 

RICE PAP 

{Papilla de Arroz) 

Made of rice-cream, and when chicken is added, called 
papilla de arroz con polio. 

PIQUANT SOUP 
(Sopa Picante) 

A vegetable soup of mixed sweet peppers and spices, originat- 
ing in the West Indies and brought to Spain by early explorers. 

PEPPERY SOUP 
(Sopa Pimentado) 

Another importation from the Caribbean, mandioca root 
boiled with pimentos and lemon juice. 

BOILED DINNER 
(Puchero) 

Puchero, like the olio, or olla, is simply the name of the 
glazed earthenware pot in which the stew is cooked. Its main 
ingredient and adornment is a calf's head, whole, which is 
served in the center of the platter with the boiled dinner heaped 
around it and the broth in a separate tureen. Puchero has be- 
come the national dish of Argentina and is served at its best 
in the Petit Salon of Buenos Aires. 

MISCELLANEOUS POTAGES 

Southern Spain is celebrated for its beef broths, often senti- 
mentalized by the use of meal from bulls that have put up losing 
fights in local arenas. Beef tea, aromatic with herbs and even 



SPANISH 115 

spiced with nasturtium leaves and seeds. Batatulla, potatoes and 
beef broth. Giblet broths and potages beyond number, on the 
order of chanfaina (see recipe) and gondingo (see note to chan- 
faina). 

There are thick soups of Spanish partridge, quail and song- 
birds; vegetable purees aplenty, though chiefly individualized in 
celery, or turnip, chick peas or onion. The Andalusian sausage 
broth, caldo con chorizos, is made with snappy crimson sausages 
sometimes hotter than the brasero, a charcoal heating pan often 
set under the dining table, draped with petticoats beneath which 
chilly feet are thrust. 

The pungent garlic soup of Andalusia, sweet and nutty with 
almonds, olive oil and thin slices of finely-knit white bread, salted 
and peppered. Boronia, corn soup. Vermicelli boiled in bull- 
fought beef broth, the paste borrowed from Italy; and many 
meaty stews served ensopada, with the pot liquor, in the particu- 
lar style of every province and usually in deep, colorfully 
decorated plates. 

But the marrowy chick pea or garbonza soup from the classic 
olla pudrida is the standard by which to judge all others. 

SPANISH STEW 
(Olla Pudrida or Cocido Espahol) 

3 pints chick peas Thick flour paste 

54 pound each: salt beef, bacon, 1 pint fresh lima beans 

salt pork and salty sausage 1 small cabbage 

1 large chicken, jointed 6 small beets 

3 small birds (or 1 pigeon) 6 small carrots 

1 pig's tail, ear or snout Y 2 pound pork sausage, sliced 

Salt % pound blood sausage, sliced 

1 onion ! /4 pound cooked veal 

1 clove % pound ham, cooked 

2 cloves garlic 2 eggs 

6 peppercorns Bread crumbs 

12 small potatoes, peeled 



n6 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Soak garbanzos (chick peas), salt beef, bacon, salt pork and 
salty sausage over night. Drain the meat and put it into a deep 
kettle with chicken and, if possible, 3 small birds, or a pigeon, 
certainly a pig's tail, ear or snout. Cover deep with cold water, 
put over the fire and bring to boiling point. Then lower the 
flame and cook slowly. Parboil garbanzos, drain, and add them 
to the stewpot gradually, taking care that the boiling does not 
cease or the peas will harden. Salt to taste and skim. Add an 
onion, pierced with a clove; add garlic and peppercorns, cover 
and seal ketde lid with flour paste. Simmer without stirring for 
5 hours. The pot can be shaken occasionally, but the skin of 
the peas must not be broken or they will not color well and 
besides, the stew will become mushy. 

At the end of the fourth hour, place in another large kettle 
with plenty of water, the fresh lima beans, cabbage, beets, carrots, 
sliced pork sausage, blood sausage, and meat balls made of 
minced cooked veal, minced ham, eggs, and enough sifted bread 
crumbs to hold them in shape. Twenty minutes later, remove 
some of the broth from the kettle and cook potatoes in it. 

Just before serving the cocido, season with teaspoon of cin- 
namon and another of saffron to give the cocido the rich color 
that stamps it perfect to the Spanish eye. Pile the garbanzos, 
well-drained, in the center of a large deep platter, circle with 
the potatoes, and place the meats around them. In another plate 
serve the other vegetables. Serve both dishes at the same time 
with the following sauce: 

SAUCE FOR THE COCIDO 

(Salsa para el Cocido) 

1 clove garlic, minced Salt 

1 sweet pepper, minced 1 large potato, cooked 

1 teaspoon saffron 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped 

3 tomatoes, cooked 2 tablespoons vinegar 

l / 4 cup cocido broth 



SPANISH 117 

Mix garlic, pepper and saffron in a bowl. Add strained 
pulp of tomatoes and the potato. Mash all together thoroughly. 
Add parsley, vinegar and cocido broth. Salt to taste and serve 
hot. In another bowl serve a cold pepper sauce. 

Strain the broth in the two cooking pots and use as soup 
course. 

A salad and an iced melon, or a compote of fruit, finishes 
this meal most satisfactorily. 

The cocido, literally a stew cooked in an olla, a round 
earthen pot with a small opening at the top, resembling the bean 
pot of Boston, is the classic dish of the country and a four- 
course dinner in itself. There are 49 Provinces in Spain, and 
regionalism is so strong it is said there are 49 national cocidos. 
It is famous throughout Castile for its excellence, and especially 
in Madrid, where it holds its own in spite of the keen competi- 
tion of international dishes so lavishly offered by the smart hotels 
and restaurants in that sophisticated city. 

A noted chef of Madrid, who proudly brings this dish to a 
rare perfection, and furnishes this recipe, says that there is no 
cut-and-dried rule for what goes into the olla. That detail is 
more or less left to the resources of the kitchen larder and the 
genius of the cook. But the process of cooking, the wily whee- 
dling of the fire, is a delicate operation and on it depends the 
success or failure of the cocido. 

It is not only a dish of delicious savor, but it is really most 
economical; its rich broth furnishes the basis of various soups 
and sauces for other meals, and the selection of its ingredients 
allows a variation to fit the changing seasons and locality of 
production. 

Cervantes' Don Quixote says of the olla grande, the "grand 
dish" to which game birds are added, "it is eaten only by canons 
and bishops." 



n8 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

"Olla pudrida" translates literally "putrid pot," but this is 
only a quirk of Spanish humor and is really an affectionate pet 
name for the national dish. The Germans, however, add insult 
to the injurious name by transferring it into their language as 
stinktopf, stink-pot. The dish indeed is as "high" as an English- 
man's grouse, which is ready for the grill when the leg-bones 
have turned powdery and green and the bird finally drops off 
them. The reason for suspecting the olla at all is merely that 
the earthenware pot from which its name derives, is never 
entirely emptied and washed out for a fresh beginning. It is like 
the old-fashioned soup-pot, sitting unchanged on the back of 
the stove, ready to receive any enriching tidbit to revivify the 
brew. Furthermore, Spanish bacon, one of the olla's main in- 
gredients, is usually greasy and rancid and since its strong savor 
persists in the pot, in some out-of-the-way posadas, where re- 
freshment is had for man and beast, this national cocido does 
live up to its name. 

An olla is also the porous clay water-pot, painted with fruits 
and flowers, which stands on every Spanish table, cooling the 
drinking water by evaporation. Where ice is scarce there is 
no better way to keep water sweet and potable. 

A STEW WITH WHEAT 
{Olla con Trigo) 

i cup wheat 2 garlic cloves, minced 

1 pig's ear 2 tablespoons olive oil 

2 pig's hocks 2 tomatoes, sliced 
1 pint chick peas, soaked Salt 

4 potatoes 54 teaspoon saffron 

Soak wheat in cold water 2 hours, put into a strong bag 
and pound it to remove husks; wash the wheat free of husks, 
and cook in unsalted water until tender. Meanwhile, put the 
pig's ear and hocks into a deep pot, cover well with water and 






SPANISH 119 



bring to a boil. Add the chick peas and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook 
4 hours. Peel potatoes and add. Cook until potatoes are done. 
Fry garlic in oil until it begins to brown; add tomatoes and 
fry. Add salt and saffron, and let simmer; stir into the cooked 
wheat. Serve wheat in a separate dish. 

OLLA A LA MALAGA 

1 pound fresh beef !4 pound pearl barley 

1 pound jerked, or dried, beef % pound rice, well washed 
l / 2 pound ham Salt 

*4 pound white kidney beans Pepper 

1 bay leaf 

Put all ingredients, except seasonings, together in an olla, 
or a bean pot. Cover closely and simmer 4 hours. Add season- 
ings to taste at beginning of fourth hour, remembering that 
both jerked beef and ham have already partially salted the dish. 

GALICIAN STEW 

(Caldo Gallego) 

3 pounds veal, cut in 6 pieces Salt, pepper, herb bouquet 

2 pounds ham, cut in 6 pieces % pound fresh kidney beans 
Y 4 pound each of 3 varieties 6 small potatoes 

cured sausage 6 small onions 

1 pig's hock 6 cubes yellow squash 

*4 pound butter 

Cover meats with boiling water and cook, with seasonings, 
until tender. Add vegetables and cook y 2 hour longer. Add 
butter just before serving. 

In Galicia the cocido is called caldo, literally broth, and is 
simpler and lighter than the national dish as made in other 
provinces. The three different sausages used by native cooks 
are the chorizo, the longaniza, and the morcilla, the latter being 



120 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

a Galician specialty. Highly seasoned and cured American hard 
sausages, of three different varieties, may be substituted. 

The Asturians call their cocido a "pote," or pot, after the 
manner of the French with their pot-au-feu, and they consider 
it incomplete without at least one of the pig's ears. 

In Andalucia whole grains of wheat are soaked, beaten in 
a bag to remove the husks, then cooked separately and served 
with a cocido made of meats, chick peas, vegetables, and either 
pears or quinces. (See recipe under olla con trigo.) 

The Aragonians add fried pimentos to their regional dish. 

The Castilians include jerked beef and forcemeat balls. 
And the cooks of La Mantana, Santander, make a rich stew 
of beef, ham, blood sausage, chicken, and green vegetables, and 
give it the classical name, olla podrida. 



FISH 

(Pescados) 



STOCK FOR BOILING FISH 



2 onions 


i cup vinegar 


2 carrots 


2 quarts water 


i leek 


i sprig chervil 


i parsnip 


Herb bouquet 


2 garlic cloves 


i tablespoon butter 



Mince the vegetables and mix with the vinegar and water. 
Add the other ingredients, stir thoroughly and cook over a slow 
fire until the liquid is reduced one-half. Then strain and bottle 
for future use. 

No fish in Spain is ever boiled in plain salted water. The 
cook keeps a bottle of this stock on hand to enrich the cooking 
water, and even the water itself must be sea water to bring out 
the true essence of sea fish. Roast fish is served at formal din- 
ners and fried fish often graces almuerza, the midday breakfast, 
but the Spanish every-day preference is for boiled fish, which 
can be served either hot or cold. 

ROAST SHAD 

(Alosa Asada) 

i (3-pound) shad 2 tablespoons butter 

2 tablespoons olive oil Shad liver 

Salt 1 cup chopped mushrooms 

Pepper l / 2 cup white wine

122 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Clean the fish and score the skin lengthwise on each side. 
Season the oil with salt and pepper and rub the fish inside and 
out. Melt butter in bottom of roasting pan, lay in the fish, and 
bake 20 minutes, basting in own juices. Meanwhile, boil the 
fish liver and mash it. Cook the mushrooms until tender in the 
liver liquor. Add the mashed liver. Put mixture in the pan 
with the fish and bake 15 minutes longer, basting well. Remove 
fish to hot platter. Pour wine in pan, heat and pour over fish. 

COD IN SAUCE 
(Meluza en Salsa) 

2 pounds fresh codfish 2 tomatoes, chopped 

Salt 2 peppercorns 

2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons roasted almonds 

1 garlic clove, halved 2 tablespoons fresh almonds 

1 onion, minced 2 tablespoons bread crumbs 

1 teaspoon minced parsley 2 tablespoons milk 

Cut fish in 4 or 5 slices and season with salt. Heat the oil 
in a saucepan and put in the garlic, onion and parsley. Fry to 
a delicate brown; remove the garlic and save. Add the tomatoes 
and when the sauce bubbles, thin with a little boiling water. Put 
in the fish and let it simmer. 

Grind to a paste the peppercorns, the fried garlic and 
almonds. Wet the crumbs in the milk and work well into the 
paste. 2 minutes before the fish is ready to take up, put the mix- 
ture in the pan and dissolve it thoroughly in the sauce. Serve 
fish in the sauce. 

HARLEQUIN OF COD 
(Arlequin de Merluza) 

3 pounds fresh codfish 4 red peppers, baked 

Salt and pepper 1 cup bread crumbs 

1 lemon 1 egg yolk 

i l /i cups cooked spinach, Buttered boiled rice 

chopped 3 tablespoons butter 



SPANISH 123 

Cut the fish into 12 symmetrical pieces, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper and put in a well-buttered baking dish. Squeeze a 
few drops of lemon juice over each slice and bake 20 minutes, 
turning once. Have ready the spinach, seasoned; the peppers, 
peeled; the bread crumbs, moistened with the beaten egg yolk; 
ancT the rice cooked, drained, and buttered. Cover four of the 
pieces of baked fish with the spinach, four with the peppers and 
put the bread crumbs on the remaining four. Place butter on 
each piece and return to the oven for five minutes. 

Arrange the fish around a hot mound of the rice in the 
center. The contrasting colors make a festive as well as an 
appetizing dish. 

CODFISH WITH CREAM SAUCE 
(Abadejo con Nata) 

2 pounds fresh cod % pound unsalted butter 

l / 2 cup stock (see recipe) 1 sprig parsley, minced 
Salt and pepper 3 green onions, minced 

1 cup light cream 

Put fish in kettle, add stock and sufficient water to cover. 
Season with salt and pepper. Boil, keeping head intact or, to 
the Spanish eye, all is ruined. 

Melt butter in a sauce pan and saute parsley and onion until 
tender. Add cream gradually. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring 
constantly. Serve in a sauce boat to accompany the cod, which 
is served on a platter with boiled potatoes and chopped parsley. 

CODFISH PIE 
{Pastel de Merluza) 

2 cups boiled codfish, flaked 1 teaspoon preserved pear, 

3 eggs, beaten slightly chopped 

Yi cup seeded raisins, chopped 1 teaspoon lemon syrup 

1 teaspoon preserved lemon, 
chopped 



124 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Combine all ingredients and cook in a double boiler to a 
rather thick paste. Serve between two baked pie crusts. 

The use of pears to enrich fish and meat dishes is over- 
looked in many countries, but the Spanish use this distinctively 
flavored fruit with great success. 

SALT CODFISH WITH HONEY 

(Bacalao con Mi el) 

i pound salt codfish 3 tablespoons olive oil 

2 egg yolks, beaten 3 tablespoons honey 
Flour 1 teaspoon cinnamon 

Soak the fish for 24 hours, changing water several times. 
Boil in unsalted water until tender. Drain, dry, and cut it into 
squares. Dip the pieces in the egg yolks and roll in flour. Fry 
gently in the oil until brown on both sides. Add honey and 
let the fish simmer in it until the liquid is absorbed. Then 
powder top with cinnamon. 

Honey is never just honey in Europe. The better varieties 
are distinguished by and sometimes named after the flowers from 
which the bees have sipped. 

Most prized in Spain is the honey of Valencia, fragrant with 
the perfume of orange blossoms and delicious with bunvelas. 
The honeys of La Alcarria and of Cuena, flavored with rosemary, 
thyme and marjoram, are excellent for seasoning fish and meats. 

GRILLED MACKEREL 
(Esconbro en Parillas) 

3 pounds fresh mackerel 3 tablespoons butter 
Salt Juice 1 lemon 
Pepper Parsley to garnish 

1 tablespoon olive oil 1 lemon, sliced 



SPANISH 125 

Split the fish down the middle of the back, if large; if not, 
broil whole; score the skin. Mix salt and pepper with oil and 
rub into the flesh. Oil a double wire broiler, lay mackerel in 
it; place under grill and brown well on both sides. Remove 
carefully to a hot dish when done. Butter generously and 
squeeze the lemon juice over the fish. 

Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon and serve with 
sauce for grilled fish (see recipe). 

This is a favorite noonday breakfast dish and a popular 
entree at dinner. 

BREAM WITH SAUCE 
(Besugo al ]ugo) 

2 pounds perch or sunfish 1 garlic clove, minced 

3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
Salt Juice 1 orange 

1 cup fish broth 

Clean, wash and drain the fish on a napkin. Rub with oil. 
Salt slightly and put under the grill to turn and cook slowly. 

Fry garlic in oil until tender. Add the lemon juice, orange 
juice and broth; cook 5 minutes and serve hot with the grilled 
fish. The sauce may be slightly thickened with flour if desired. 

The bream of European waters is similar to our yellow perch 

and sunfish. 

BREAM SUPREME

dish large enough to hold the fish nicely. Place the fish in it, 



126 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

sprinkle with salt and bake in a hot oven from 15 to 20 minutes, 

turning once carefully. 

Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small saucepan and fry 

the garlic. Add J^ teaspoon of salt, pepper, cloves and wine. 

Stir in toasted bread crumbs, remove from fire, and serve as a 

sauce 

SMOTHERED BROOK TROUT 

(Truchias Obscuras) 

6 brook trout *4 teaspoon each pepper, nut- 
Salt meg, thyme, saffron and 
% cup butter, melted chopped parsley 
Yi cup toasted bread crumbs, l / 2 cup dry white wine 
sifted 

Clean, dry and salt the fish. Use a baking pan large enough 
to hold them without overlapping. Spread melted butter on 
the bottom and sprinkle over it a thin layer of the bread crumbs, 
which have been rolled in a mixture of the salt, pepper, nutmeg, 
thyme, saffron and parsley. Add wine. Place the fish on top; 
scatter over them the rest of the crumb mixture; dot with butter. 
Bake in a moderate oven (350 F.), basting well. 

FRICASSEE OF FISH 
(P esc ado Guisado) 

2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup boiling water 

1 garlic clove, minced *4 teaspoon each pepper, cloves, 

2 tomatoes, chopped cinnamon, minced parsley, 
1 pound fish and saffron 

Y 2 cup ground almonds 

Heat olive oil in a saucepan until it smokes. Cool a little 
and fry in it the garlic and tomatoes. When mixture bubbles, 
put in the fish and saute while you prepare the sauce. 

Stir the almonds into the boiling water and add pepper, 
cloves, cinnamon, parsley and saffron. Stir well and add to the 



SPANISH 127 

contents of the saucepan. Continue cooking the fish in the sauce. 
Remove to hot platter and pour sauce over. 

PANNED FISH 

(Pescado en Casuella Catalana) 

1 garlic clove, minced 1 teaspoon flour 

1 tomato, sliced 2 cups boiling water 

2 tablespoons olive oil Salt 

1 teaspoon saffron 1 pound fish (any kind) 

Fry garlic and tomato in oil until a delicate brown. Remove 
from oil, add saffron, and mash to a paste. Brown flour in 
remaining oil and gradually stir in the boiling water. Add 
paste and cook 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Salt the fish and 
add. Cook until brown on both sides and all sauce is absorbed. 

Spaniards are quite partial to saffron, which makes even a 
simple dish look festive, especially when served in the beautiful 
native pottery. 

Saffron is made by infusing the stamens of a variety of 
crocus which flowers in Autumn, and its use in food originated 
in Persia or Kashmir, from whence the Arabs carried it west 
and the Monguls east. The Crusaders brought it to England, 
but we Anglo-Saxons have limited its use to a harmless vegetable 
coloring matter. It is valued for its pungent taste and peculiar 
musky odor wherever the influence of Arabian, Persian, and 
East Indian cooking has spread. A Spanish writer describes 
his country as "God's paradise, fruitful in crops, delicious with 
fruits, plenteous in deer and all kinds of game, abounding with 
fish, made glad by good wines, sweetened with honey, lighted 
with wax, seasoned with oil, and gay with saffron."

RAY WITH ALMOND SAUCE 
(Raya con Nueces) 

i pound ray fish i tablespoon flour 

(wings of the skate) i tablespoon lemon juice 

Salt Vi teaspoon nutmeg 

i onion, sliced 2 tablespoons almonds, peeled 
Liver of ray and ground 

1 tablespoon butter, melted 

Place the ray in cold water in a casserole with a little salt 
and the sliced onion. Bring to a boil, then take up the fish, 
drain, remove skin and put to cook in just enough boiling water 
to cover. When done, take out and place on a hot serving plate. 

Meanwhile boil the liver of the ray in a separate saucepan. 
Blend melted butter with flour. Mash the liver with iJ4 cups 
of the liquid it was boiled in, and add, with the lemon juice, 
nutmeg and ground almonds. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring con- 
stantly, and serve with the fish. 

A white sauce seasoned with capers often accompanies this 

fish. 

TUNNY IN CASSEROLE 

(Atun en Olid) 

1 pound tinned tunny fish 1 celery stalk, chopped 

*4 cup butter % teaspoon each cinnamon, 

1 onion, sliced cloves, salt, pepper and 

2 cups cooked chick peas caraway seeds 
*4 head cabbage, chopped % teaspoon saffron 
1 tomato, chopped 1 teaspoon flour 

Cut or break the tunny into neat pieces. Heat 2 tablespoons 
butter, lay tunny in carefully and brown, taking care that it is 
not broken in turning. Take up and set aside. Add 1 tablespoon 
butter to pan, and fry onion until golden. Press chick peas with 
their liquor through a fine sieve, and add with cabbage, tomato, 







SPANISH 






131 


celery, 


seasonings, 


and saffron. Pour in 


enough 


boiling 


water 


to cover and simmer 15 minutes. 









In another pan melt remaining tablespoon butter. Add flour 
and brown. Pour in 1 cup broth from the cooking vegetables, 
stir until well blended. Pour into a fireproof dish, add vege- 
tables; lay the tunny on top, and keep hot in oven or over 
steam for 10 minutes, so the flavors will penetrate the fish. 

The tunny is a glorified giant mackerel, growing to ten 
feet in length. Before cooking, its meat is blood red. It is pre- 
served in large tins, imported by Italian grocers, who sell the 
fish in bulk by the pound at a cheaper price than the small 
individual tins used for hors d'oeuvres. 

SALMON PANCAKE 

(Tortilla de Salmon) 

2 eggs Yi teaspoon salt 

1 cup canned salmon 1 teaspoon minced parsley 

1 tablespoon butter, melted 

Beat the eggs and shred the salmon. Mix lightly and add the 

salt and parsley. Form in the shape of a thick pancake and fry 

in the butter. 

EEL WHITEBAIT 

(Angulas Frit a) 

Angulas are little, almost transparent, newly spawned eels, 
about 2 inches long, although the term includes the whitebait 
of other finny species. They are netted before dawn and never 
kept over 24 hours. Fried in deep olive oil so crisp that they 
roll off the fork, and brought to the table with the oil still 
popping, they are delicious.

SQUID A LA CATALANA 

(Calamares con Guisantes Cataland) 

6 medium-sized squid l / z teaspoon saffron 

2 onions, sliced l /i teaspoon cinnamon 

2 tablespoons olive oil i bay leaf, minced 

i garlic clove, minced i cup claret 

i teaspoon minced parsley i cup boiling water 

i large tomato, chopped Salt 

4 peppercorns, ground 2 cups young peas, cooked 
2 tablespoons butter 

Wash, clean and pound the flesh of the squid, then cut into 
pieces. Slowly fry the onions in olive oil; add the garlic and 
parsley and fry until golden. Add the tomato, and when 
bubbling put in the squid and mix well. Add pepper, saffron, 
cinnamon and bay leaf and cook 5 minutes. Add wine and 
water, cover close and simmer 2 hours. When tender add salt. 
Drain peas, add butter, mix with the squid and serve very hot. 

Squid is plentiful along the Mediterranean coast and the 
Catalans make succulent dishes of it, the most notable being 
calamares en su tinta, squid in its own ink. Another, just as 
strange to the foreign palate, is squid cooked with chocolate. 

SPANISH SQUID 
(Calamares Espaghol) 

6 medium-sized squid Cayenne 

% cup olive oil Yz cup orange flower water 

1 garlic clove, minced 2 tablespoons vinegar 

Salt 

Wash the squid well and cut into pieces. Heat the oil in 
a sauce pan and brown the garlic and squid, turning them con- 
stantly. Cool slightly, add cayenne, orange flower water and 



SPANISH 133 

vinegar; simmer until tender, keeping closely covered to retain 
flavor. Add salt only after the squid is done. If desired, a little 
boiling water may bemadded and the sauce thickened with flour. 

The orange flower water is a Moorish touch, borrowed from 
the Arabs of North Africa, who substituted it for the rose water 
so prominent in the cooking of Asia Minor. 

PAINTING THE EEL RED 

(Pintarrajas a Anquilas) 

1 (3-pound) eel 1 cup roasted almonds 
3 tablespoons vinegar Juice l / 2 lemon 

2 garlic cloves, minced Salt 

1 tablespoon minced parsley 1 egg yolk, beaten 

2 tablespoons olive oil 

*4 teaspoon each cloves, cinna- 
mon, saffron and pepper 

Clean and skin eel and place it in boiling water and vinegar 

for 10 minutes. Cut into 2-inch lengths and dry. Fry garlic 

and parsley in oil. Add % CU P broth obtained from parboiling 

eel. Mix cloves, cinnamon, saffron and pepper and stir in. Put 

eels into a pan and cover with boiling water. Simmer until 

tender, add roasted almonds, cut in slivers, and the lemon juice. 

Boil up once, salt, and remove fish to hot platter. Take the pan 

from fire and stir in egg yolk. Serve in a sauce boat with the 

fish. 

CRABS 

(Cambaros) 

The Spanish cook uses the small crabs in pastes and bisques 
mainly. The large ones are boiled, preferably in sea water, and 
presented chilled and piled in a pyramid with branches of parsley 
curled about them. 



134 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

SHRIMP PATTIES 

{Empanadas de Camarones) 

Heat cooked shrimps, stoned olives and a little cooked celery, 
diced, in reduced salsa espanola (Spanish sauce) ; put in covered 
patty shells and place in the oven 8 minutes. 

The Spaniards are great piecers between meals, as well as 
ardent cafe loungers; their fondness for shrimps is so great that 
if they had nothing to do they would sit before a cup of coffee 
or chocolate in a sidewalk cafe and shuck shrimps all day long. 
Ambulating peddlers of boiled shrimps cover regular routes with 
wicker baskets loaded with the succulent curled sea-food laid 
out in patterns beneath a white cloth. These sell as readily as 
peanuts at an American baseball game and are cracked open 
and eaten with the same nonchalant avidity. 

When made into empanadas or patties they are kept warm 
in a little nickel-mounted glass box on every bar, so the drinker 
may help himself and pay his penny. By being kept piping 
hot they have an advantage over the pork and veal pies, sold 
cold in English bars. 

Empanadas resemble the popular English pasties in being 
made of snips of game, larks, pigeons, everything tasty, but they 
differ in being juicier and always richly flavored with olives. 
Very small empanadas are affectionately called empanadillas. 



EGGS 

(Huevos) 



HUEVOS A LA MODE 

6 eggs i tablespoon minced parsley 

i tablespoon prepared mustard 6 slices fried bread 
i tablespoon Gruyere cheese, 
grated 

Fry the eggs on both sides. Have mixed together the 
mustard, parsley and grated Gruyere cheese. Spread fried bread 
with this mixture and serve hot with the eggs. 

Eggs cooked in some style appear at nearly every almuerza, 
the Spanish breakfast, which is served at noon. As in all 
European countries, the Spanish early morning breakfast is a 
light afTair. Bread-women call at the doors leaving pomecillos 
(large rolls), which with a generous bowl of coffee and hot 
goat's milk, half and half, usually break the night's fast for rich 
and poor alike. Herds of goats are driven through the streets 
and milked at one's doorstep, so the milk for coffee is always 
fresh and unadulterated. 

EGGS MODERN STYLE 
(Huevos a la Moderna)

tender. Break the eggs over the vegetables and season. Have the 
flame low and turn carefully in spoonfuls from the bottom of 
the pan as the eggs break and mix with the saute. 2 or 3 
minutes will suffice for the cooking. Serve immediately. Canned 
asparagus and mushrooms can be used. 

As in Spain one always waits for this dish to be prepared, 
it makes an excellent one for table cooking.

SPANISH OMELET 

{Tortilla de Huevos Espahol) 

5 tablespoons olive oil 1 green pepper, chopped 

1 onion, sliced fine 2 cups beef broth 

Yz garlic clove, minced Salt and pepper 

1 large tomato, chopped Vz teaspoon minced parsley 

4 mushrooms, chopped 7 eggs 

5 tablespoons cold water 

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil, add onion and fry slowly until 
it begins to color; add garlic and fry until golden. Then add 
tomato; simmer; add mushrooms and green pepper and simmer 
until thick. Pour in broth and simmer, stirring frequently until 
liquid is the consistency of a sauce; season and add parsley. At 
least three-quarters of an hour of constant care is necessary to 
bring this sauce to perfection. Beat eggs, with water and sea- 
sonings only, until thoroughly mixed. Heat remaining olive oil 
to near smoking, pour in egg mixture and reduce heat some- 
what. Proceed to make omelet in the French manner, thus: 
Hold the handle of the pan with the left hand; as soon as a 
good film is set tilt pan toward you, lift the far half of film 
and fold it over toward you; set pan level again and liquid egg 
at once covers the bottom of the pan and a new film sets, which 
is lifted and deftly turned over the part already cooked. Repeat 
as many times as is possible, for the more layers of film, the 
more tender the omelet. When the last film is set lay some 
of the sauce across the center of omelet and roll the part already 
cooked over it. Leave only until well set, then slide onto a hot 
platter. Pour sauce around and serve at once. The omelet must 
be moist, and creamy, the inside having the tender consistency 
of a custard. 

The pan is the secret of a successful omelet. It should be 
thick, shallow, wide, and have spreading sides, in order to allow 
the greatest freedom in manipulating the eggs; but most im- 



142 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

portant of all, it must be kept perfectly smooth by being used 
for no other frying. In case the careless cook should allow the 
omelet to stick, the pan may be made smooth by heating oil or 
lard in it and then wiping it clean with successive wads of 
crumpled brown paper, rubbing and polishing until no vestige 
of scorched butter or egg remains. An omelet pan is always 
kept right for the next omelet by cleaning it in this manner. 
It should never be washed. A wide spatula is best for lifting 
the cooked film from the bottom of the pan, as well as for the 
final rolling and taking up.

i 4 4 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

The frilled white crust gives them their quaint name "petti- 
coats." 

These pastelillos belong to the famous empanada family 
that has stretched from Spain and Portugal across to Cuba, 
Mexico and all Spanish American countries. There is nothing 
quite like them in any other cuisine and they go wonderfully 
with wine. Most recipes include olives for piquance and there 
is a resemblance between these pasties and olives, for both are 
acquired tastes. At first any sort of empanada may seem 
squashy, because of the abundance of juice and gravy generally 
lacking in other meat pies. But once the pastelillo appetite is 
formed they are downed by the peck, like oysters. 

SAUSAGE BREAD 
(Coca de Sobreasada) 

i standard recipe coffee bread Uncooked pork sausage 

dough Paprika 

Sweet green or red peppers Granulated sugar 

Roll coffee cake dough into a thin layer and place in a 
baking pan. Slice peppers and cover dough with them. Place 
on top pieces of sausage about the size of large plums. Powder 
scarlet with paprika. Sprinkle a generous amount of sugar over 
this and bake. Serve hot. 

This is a delicious invention of Mallorca, where it is baked 

in huge stone ovens on round baking tins from 2 to 3 feet in 

diameter. 

VEAL WITH ASPARAGUS 

(Ternera con Esparragos) 

2 ribs veal 1 small turnip, minced 

Salt 3 small carrots, chopped 

Water 1 bay leaf, minced 

1 onion, minced 1 sprig parsley, minced 



SPANISH 145 

1 bunch fresh asparagus 1 tablespoon butter 

1 tablespoon flour 2 egg yolks, beaten 

Juice of x /z lemon 

Boil veal ribs in salted water together with the onions, turnip, 
carrots, bay leaf and parsley. Cut asparagus in 2-inch lengths 
and cook separately. When the meat is tender, thicken the broth 
with the flour which has been browned in the butter. Add 
beaten egg yolks and the lemon juice. Put in drained asparagus, 
boil up once and serve. 

CALVES' BRAINS 
(Sesos de Ternera) 

1 pair calf's brains 3 tablespoons butter 

% cup vinegar 3 sprigs parsley 

Cooked green peas 

Blanch brains in boiling water. Remove the outer skin, 
being careful not to break the inner tissue. Place in cold water 
for 1 hour. Drain, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the vinegar over 
them and leave another half hour. Melt butter in saucepan, 
drain and lightly salt the brains and fry to a golden brown. 
Place on a hot serving dish and fry the parsley. Add remaining 
vinegar to pan, heat well and pour over the brains. Garnish 
with green peas. 

KIDNEYS IN SHERRY

salt and the sherry. Simmer 5 minutes, serve very hot in the 
sauce, garnished with cress. 

BEEF TOLEDO STYLE 

(Vaca a Estilo de Toledon) 
! /4 pound sliced bacon Herb bouquet 

1 (4-pound) roast l / 2 cup red wine 

2 carrots, minced Juice l / 2 lemon 
1 onion, minced Salt 

Pepper 

Put strips of bacon in the bottom of a baking pan and lay 
the roast over them. Cover with carrots, onion and bouquet. 
Pour wine in the bottom of the pan with lemon juice. Season 
with salt and pepper, cover very closely and bake in a moderate 
oven (350°F.) basting occasionally. Pour fat from the pan, 
strain remaining gravy and serve with the meat. 

A bottle of dry white wine and another of common red 
wine always stand on the kitchen shelf. The Spanish cook, in 
contrast to the French chef, is very informal about the use of 
wine in cooking. A splash of wine will moisten a drying dish, 
when water would spoil the texture. And a few tablespoons 
of wine are thrown into the roasting pan for basting, or added 
to thin a sauce. Wine will soften a tough cut of meat and 
shorten the cooking time. In such cases the wine does not 
appear as an ingredient in a recipe. Red wines are used with 
red meats; white wines with white meats, fish and vegetables. 

ROAST BEEF SPANISH STYLE 

(Rosbif Espano Pizado) 
1 (5-pound) roast Salt 

3 tablespoons olive oil l /i cup red wine 
1 teaspoon each pepper, bay 

leaf, parsley and chopped 
» scallions 



SPANISH 147 

Marinate meat 8 to 10 hours in a mixture of olive oil, pepper, 
bay leaf, parsley and scallions. Place in a roasting pan, season 
with salt and add marinating mixture. Roast in a hot oven 
(400 F.) about 20 minutes, turning several times. Reduce heat, 
add wine and finish roasting, basting frequently. 

The beef of Spain is raised for bull-fighting and not for the 
table, hence it lacks the richer flavor and juicy tenderness of finer 
beef cattle. To overcome this lack, the beef is not only hung 
for 2 or 3 days but the Spanish cook marinates it, thereby adding 
greatly to the flavor. 

There are four common methods of roasting to choose 
from: on the spit, in the oven, enveloped in oiled paper, and 
between the gridirons over clear coals; but preference is usually 
given to the spit, on which the meat continuously turns before 
a lively charcoal fire until it is well seared. Then the heat is 
lessened and the roast is frequently basted with wine, its own 
juices, and some of the seasoned oil. A long needle is thrust 
into the meat when it is considered properly roasted, and if no 
blood follows but just a rich reddish juice flows, the roast is 
taken up. Its juices caught in a pan underneath are poured 
around it, and a dish of potatoes, mashed, boiled, or in croquettes, 
invariably accompanies it to the table. 

SPANISH BEEFSTEAK 

(Chateau briant a la Espanola) 

One thinks of this dish as belonging exclusively to the French 
cuisine; but it is very common in the Spanish kitchen. The 
steaks are l / 2 the thickness of the French cuts. Well pounded 
at first, they are then quickly broiled, seasoned and served on 
toast with little mounds of tender peas and melted butter topping 
them, and with a sprig of parsley added. Bits of truffle are 
often mixed with the peas.

PORK HAMBURGERS 
(Came de Cerdo en Tortilla)

1 onion, minced 1 teaspoon vinegar 

1 garlic clove, minced 1 egg yolk 

1 sprig parsley, minced Bread crumbs 

1 teaspoon each salt, pepper, Fat for frying 
cinnamon and saffron 

Put pork through a grinder and place in a bowl with onion, 
garlic and parsley. Add salt and pepper, cinnamon and saffron. 
Stir in butter and vinegar. Let the mixture season for an hour. 
Form into cakes, dip in egg yolk beaten with a little cold water 
and cover with bread crumbs. Fry on both sides. 

Tortillas of beef and mutton are made the same way. 

The Spaniard utilizes every portion of the pig; nothing is 
thrown away. The tail, the ear, the snout and the ribs figure 
largely in their succulent cocidos. The kidneys are cooked in 
wine. Chitterlings appear in pies. A roast ham is usually the 
selection for a formal occasion, and an embuchado, a large 
sausage made of pork minced fine, is the popular choice of a 
more intimate table, while jellied pigs feet are luncheon treats. 

SUGARED PORK 
(Carne de Cerdo en Dulce) 

1 pork loin 2 tablespoons syrup 

Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 

2 tablespoons fat Thin slices orange 
1 pint white wine Parsley sprigs 

Rub the meat well with salt and pepper and brown it nicely 
in hot fat. Add the wine, syrup, and just enough boiling water 
to half cover. Cover the kettle as close as possible and let simmer 
until tender, turning every 5 minutes at first, then every 10

minutes. Allow 30 minutes to the pound. When tender take 
out and sprinkle sugar over it. Set under grill until a sugar 
crust forms. Garnish with orange slices and parsley. 

Serve with salsa de Catalana, substituting the liquid in 
which the pork was cooked for the salsa espanola required in 
the salsa de Catalana recipe. (See under sauces.) 

PORK CHOPS WITH CAPERS 

{Chuletas de Cerdo con Alcaparras) 

6 pork chops 1 teaspoon vinegar 

Salt 1 green pepper, minced 

Flour 2 tablespoons capers 

1 tablespoon butter Parsley sprigs 

Hot meat broth 12 Spanish olives 

Have the chops cut fairly thin, salt them and roll in flour. 
Heat butter in a sauce pan and put in the chops, turning them 
until both sides are a golden brown. Then put in enough broth 
to not quite cover them and add vinegar. Cook, closely covered, 
over moderate heat for 40 minutes. When ready to serve add 
green pepper and capers. Garnish with parsley and olives. 

Pickled green nasturtium seeds are much used in place of 
capers, for the Spaniards consider the nasturtium, flowers, leaves, 
stems and seeds, indispensable ingredients in several dishes. 

GRILLED RASHERS OF PORK 

(Lonjas de Cerdo Esparrilladas) 

1 pound lean pork Olive oil 

Salt and pepper Chestnut and red bean puree 

Cut pork as thin as breakfast bacon. Season with salt and 
pepper and rub on each side with olive oil. Grill under a quick 
flame 15 minutes, then arrange on a plate in the form of a 
crown a thick puree of chestnuts and red beans in the center

mashed potatoes. 

ORENSE CURATES HAM 
(Jamon del Cura de Sacra de Orense) 

1 ham 3 onions, sliced 

Sour grass or sorrel Herb bouquet 

% cup coriander seeds Granulated sugar 

3 carrots, sliced Parsley 

1 parsnip, sliced 1 tablespoon flour 

2 tablespoons sherry 

Put ham in a large pot with a wisp of sour grass, coriander 
seeds, carrots, parsnip, onion and herb bouquet, and cold water 
to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer about 3 or 4 hours, or 
until tender. Wash skin in hot water, but do not remove it, 
for the Spanish cook says "the skin of the ham is the bottle 
that holds the perfume within." Rub skin generously with 
sugar and brown in the oven. The Spanish cook uses a red 
hot Pala or salamander to melt the sugar into the skin and 
brown it to a golden crust. Serve on platter in a nest of parsley 
and ornament shank bone with a paper rosette. Make sauce 
by browning flour in 1 tablespoon fat skimmed from the cooking 
liquor. Gradually stir in 1 cup strained liquor, add sherry and 
serve. 

A hot spinach pie usually accompanies baked ham. This 
is simply minced cooked spinach, well seasoned, covered with a 
pie crust and baked. If the occasion is a fiesta, there will be 
purees of apples and chestnuts; and gelatines cut in fancy forms, 
sugared, and dipped in chocolate. 

Throughout the province of Orense ham is at its best, the 
hog's fare being almost exclusively the big rich chestnuts of the 
region. Other fine hams come from Aviles, Jabuco, Montachez, 
Trevelez, and Villalba.

Marinate the meat for several hours in a pickle made with 
a mixture of all the ingredients except the salt pork. After 5 
hours remove the meat from the pickle, cut the salt pork in thin 
shreds and lard the meat well with it. Then envelop meat in 
well-oiled paper bag and put it in the oven to bake. After 54

and serve in its own juices. 

CHICKEN SPANISH STYLE 
(Polio a la Espahol) 

1 young chicken 2 ground peppercorns 

1 slice salt pork 1 teaspoon salt 

1 teaspoon flour 6 or 8 boiled potatoes 

2 cups tomato juice 1 cup green peas 

Joint the chicken and dice the salt pork. Fry the pork in 
a saucepan and brown the chicken in the fat. Stir in the flour 
and add the tomato juice. Add pepper and salt and sufficient 
boiling water to just cover the chicken. Cover closely and let 
cook until tender. 

Cook potatoes and peas separately and add to the cooked 

chicken. Let all heat together for 5 minutes with the cover off, 

then serve.

then add it to the contents of the kettle together with the rice 
and a little boiling water. Simmer together for i hour, stirring 
occasionally. Add clams, cut in pieces, and their liquor. Cook 
io to 15 minutes longer, season, if necessary, and serve on a large 
deep platter, well-heated. 

Garnish with stuffed olives and rings of sweet pepper. 

Like so many Spanish dishes, this is a whole meal in itself. 
It may be made very satisfactorily by substituting navy beans 
for the Spanish peas, though it is the latter that gives the dish 
its fine flavor; and the clams may be omitted, though they are 
a tasty touch.

Thoroughly clean, wash and season the bird, but do not 
stuff it. Tie ham and pork slices under and around it with 
thread. Envelop it in an oiled paper bag and place it in the 
baking pan. Put into the oven to bake, not too fast. Baste 
frequently by turning it over in the pan. When the turkey is 
nearly done remove the paper, pork and ham slices and finish 
roasting. 



158 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Skim grease from pan gravy, and pour over bird when 
serving. 

In Spain all turkeys seem young and tender. They are 
driven in droves through the streets of Seville, and the driver 
bargains with the housewife through her open window or door. 

Turkey is the festive bird, no Spanish Christmas is com- 
plete without it, although instead of being eaten at noon it is 
served at about two o'clock Christmas morning, after the people 
have returned from midnight mass. The feast usually begins 
with wonderful almond soup, for Jordan almonds are indigenous 
to Spain, and marches to the tune of drum-sticks right through 
to nuts, Malaga raisins and numerous sweets and wines, enough 
to last till dawn. 

The gobbler is specially prepared for killing by having a big 
drink of old sherry forced down his gullet, enough to make him 
quite groggy. This renders the meat even more tender and 
palatable. The turkey is then painlessly decapitated, defeathered 
and hung in the open air, preferably throughout a clear moon- 
light night. Next day he is cleaned, dressed, washed out with 
sound white wine, stuffed with chestnuts and walnuts, put in 
the oven and lovingly basted with a rich broth prepared well in 

advance. 

ROAST QUAIL

Wild birds are a frequent and popular lunch feature, and 
all is game that flies, from partridge, doves and quail, to the 
smallest reed or song birds, the latter being sold a dozen on a 
string, each bird being little more than a mouthful. Tiny birds

SPANISH 163 

The Espanola, favorite sauce of the Spaniards, is the most 
important: La madre de todas las dames — the mother of all others. 
It forms the basis of all good brown sauces, its rich, exquisite

GARNISH FOR VEAL OR MUTTON 

(Guarnicion Para Ternero o Carrier o) 

Sliced onions and sliced potatoes, fried separately in olive oil 
or lard, well seasoned, often accompany veal or mutton. 

Or a thick puree of dried beans surrounding tender young 
artichokes fried in butter; little clusters of cauliflowers that have 
been dipped in a tart sauce; and small potatoes, browned in but- 
ter and powdered with bits of parsley; all of these are excellent 
accompaniments to either dish. 

GARNISH FOR FOWLS 

(Guarnicion Para Polios) 

Cut salt pork in thin strips, fry in butter to a golden crisp 
and dust with a little powdered sugar. Mold acidulated, boiled 
onions in gelatine. Cut mushrooms in half and fry in butter. 
To garnish roast chicken or pigeons. 

GARNISH FOR BIRDS 
(Guarnicion Para Aves) 

Decorate with large fancy olives, tiny glazed onions and rings 
of uncooked sweet peppers. 



SPANISH 171 

Black, gray, yellow, purple, mauve and green olives, some 
small as cherries, others big as plums, plain, salted, pickled or 
bursting with rich stuffing, are sold by weight from jars and tubs 
in the markets and at the food shops. Like old-fashioned pickles 
here at home, olives are put up according to a thousand private 
recipes. A favorite method of pickling the large varieties is to 
slash the flesh and insert bits of highly flavored filling before 
immersing in the pickling liquid, which may be manzanilla or 
other white wine, wine vinegar or Asturian cider vinegar. All 
varieties are more tasty than California "queens" and in some 
cases this is because of the clever gashings, gorings and stuffings 
that carry the seasonings right into the pit. These olives are 
stoned and twisted into appetizing bonne-bouches to accompany 
many meat dishes. The Spanish cook also uses them generously 
in the making of stews and ragouts. A meal without olives in 
some form is not to be found in all Spain. 

GARNISH OF ARTICHOKES 

{Guarnicion de Alcachofas)

the batter. Lift out and fry in boiling lard. When brown, turn 
and fry the other side. Drain on brown paper. 

Fried Tomatoes: Slice very thin and season. Dip slices in 
beaten egg, then into bread crumbs and fry in hot fat. Turn care- 



172 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

fully with a cake turner; pile on a heated plate, and serve very 

hot. 

Fried Onions : Slice and cover them with milk for 5 minutes, 

drain and lay in sifted bread crumbs; fry in hot fat for about 10 

minutes. 

GARNISH FOR ROASTS 

{Guarnicion Madrilend) 

Cut large round tomatoes in halves and scoop out a small 
hollow in each center. For each half of a tomato fry ^4 clove 
garlic in 1 teaspoon butter, season with salt and pepper and place 
in the tomato. Lay on top of it a large black olive, circled with 
an anchovy and put into a hot oven to bake. Pile a pyramid of 
fried potatoes in the center of the serving dish and edge with the 
tomato halves. 

GARNISH FOR FOWL

SALADS 

(Ensaladas) 



SPANISH DRESSING 

(Condimento Espanol) 

l / 2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons olive oil 

1 tablespoon vinegar l / 2 teaspoon peppercorns, ground 

1 garlic clove, finely minced 

Dissolve salt in the vinegar. Put the oil into a small bowl 
and gradually add the pepper and garlic. Then add the vinegar 
a few drops at a time, beating continually for about 2 minutes 
until thoroughly mixed. 

An old Spanish proverb says: "To make a perfect salad 
there should be a miser for vinegar, a spendthrift for oil, a wise 
man for salt, and a madcap to stir all these ingredients." 

LETTUCE SALAD 

(Ensalada de Lechuga Fino) 

1 head lettuce 2 eggs, hard-boiled 

Spanish dressing 1 sweet red pepper 

Wash fresh, crisp lettuce leaves, dry thoroughly and place in 
the salad bowl. Pour the dressing over them and toss lightly but 
thoroughly so that each leaf is coated. Garnish with slices of the 
eggs and rings of the pepper. 

Salads are not as popular in Spain as they are in France, but 
they make a much gayer appearance, and this is not only due to 

187 



188 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

the colorful peppers and olives. Centuries back, when Spain was 
greatly influenced by oriental invasion, especially by the Moors, 
the country adopted an oriental plate or table dish unrivalled any- 
where in size, brilliance and gaiety of design. The Moorish 
plate is wide, deep and generously rimmed, thick but light; ideal 
for salads. Roomy, cheerful, appetizing, it glints with arabesques 
in gold, silver and copper, dances with folk festivals fired into the 
glaze, riots with fruits, flowers, lambs, unicorns and Goyaesque 
grotesqueries. Since Spanish plates are now cheap in imitation 
and even the originals in antique stores are not expensive, no 
salad-lover should be without one. 

TOMATO SALAD 

(Ensalada de Tomate) 

4 large ripe tomatoes 2 dozen pickled onions 

2 cups mayonnaise dressing 

Arrange on large flat salad dish, first a ring of sliced tomatoes 
around the edge, then a ring of onions inside of that, another of 
tomatoes and the mayonnaise in a mound in the center. 

GREEN PEPPER SALAD 

{Ensalada de Pimiento Verde) 

6 green peppers 1 onion 

3 tomatoes Spanish dressing 

Blanch the peppers, remove the skins and seeds and cut in 
halves. Peel and slice the tomatoes and onion, the latter in very 
thin slices. Arrange on salad plate and serve with dressing. 

STRING BEAN SALAD 
(Ensalada de Habas Verde) 

3 cups cooked string beans Small cucumber pickles 
Spanish dressing 1 lemon 

1 teaspoon minced parsley 



SPANISH 189

garnish with small cucumber pickles and thin triangles of lemon 
dipped in parsley. 

LIMA BEAN SALAD 
(Ensalada de Habas) 

1 lettuce heart 2 cups cooked peas 

2 cups cooked lima beans 1 Spanish onion

dressing. Place on lettuce leaves. 

GREEN PEA SALAD 

(Ensalada Habas Verde) 

1 cup lettuce, chopped 1 sweet onion 

French dressing 1 cup cooked peas

in dressing for 5 minutes. Serve in nests of the prepared lettuce. 

VEGETABLE SALAD 

(Ensaladas de Vegetals) 

2 cooked potatoes 2 cooked beets 

1 small onion 2 medium-sized tomatoes 

Spanish dressing 3 cooked carrots 

1 cup cooked string beans 

Dice potatoes and onion, mix with dressing and put in the 
center of the salad dish. Slice beets and tomatoes, and edge the 
platter with them, placed alternately, with a little space between. 
Cut carrots lengthwise in strips, cut beans lengthwise once, and 



190 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

lay them in the spaces between the tomatoes and beets, so they 
shoot out in rays from the potato salad center. Sprinkle Spanish 
dressing over all. 

MIDNIGHT SALAD 

(Ensalada de Noche) 

i head lettuce Salt and pepper 

3 cups cold cooked shrimps Spanish dressing 
i cup cooked truffles i cup mayonnaise dressing 

Stuffed olives 

Crisp the lettuce leaves in cold water and dry in a napkin. 
Cut the shrimps in half and chop the truffles. Season with salt 
and pepper and mix them well. Make six nests of the lettuce 
leaves on the salad plate; sprinkle lightly with Spanish dressing. 
Mix truffles and shrimp with mayonnaise and pile on the nests. 
Garnish with stuffed olives. A favorite after theatre dish. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

{Ensalada Polluello) 

2 cups cold cooked chicken i onion, minced fine 

i head crisp lettuce i cup mayonnaise 

Salt 2 hard-boiled eggs 

i teaspoon tarragon, chopped 2 beets 

Asparagus tips 

Dice the chicken meat, chop fine the firm inner leaves of 
the lettuce, and season with salt and tarragon. Mix the two and 
add the onion. Mix all lightly with the mayonnaise and garnish 
with sliced eggs, slices of beets, and asparagus tips. 

ORANGE SALAD 

{Ensalada de Naranjas) 

Oranges Powdered sugar in proportion 

Rum or kirsch to taste 



SPANISH 191 

Slice juicy oranges with peel. Place in a fine glass dish, cover 
with sugar and moisten with rum or kirsch. 

Since Spanish oranges are exceptionally flavorsome and sapid, 
this salad is a favorite all the way from Cadiz to Barcelona. 

ICE SALAD 
(Ensalada Helada) 

Assorted fruits 1 pint lemon, or any desired 

fruit ice 

1 pint of fruit ice is sufficient for 6 servings. Partly fill sher- 
bet glasses with fresh fruit, melon in balls, and pile large spoon- 
fuls of fruit ice on top. 

Melons and citrons were popularized in Spain by the in- 
vading Moors and many desserts and salads are made luscious 
by them. Columbus spread the fame of the Spanish melon by 
carrying its seeds on his first voyage to America. The Indians 
took them then as far from the coast as New Mexico, so we have 
inherited many of our finest melons from the Spanish. 

The nasturtium, flower, leaf and green seed is a standard gar- 
nish in Spain. So this iced fruit salad would be made all the 
more appetizing and decoratively Spanish by the addition of half 
a dozen nasturtium buds.

parable flavor. 
r MACAROONS 

(Almendrados) 

% cup blanched almonds 1 teaspoon each, mace, cinna- 
3 e gg whites mon, nutmeg 

Y\ cup powdered sugar 1 teaspoon rosewater 

4 drops bitter almond 

Pound almonds smooth as your cheek, adding a little egg- 
white to prevent oiling, and let stand overnight if convenient. In 
morning, beat egg-whites to a stiff froth, adding sugar gradually 
in small quantities. Continue beating, stir in spices and rose- 
water a little at a time and add pounded almonds gradually. 
Flavor. The mixture should be worked until it becomes a soft 
dough — if too thick it will be heavy, if too thin the cake will 
spread and run over in baking. 

Take up dough with teaspoon and shape into balls with your 
fingers, floured. Lay on buttered baking sheet, 2 inches apart, 
and bake 8-10 minutes in moderate oven (35o°F.). The maca- 
roons should rise in the middle while baking and crack on the 
surface. Split almonds may be laid on top before baking. 

Macaroons and macaroni are Siamese twins in origin, both 
being the offspring of the Italian root-word maccare — to bruise, 
crush to a paste. Although accredited to Italy, macaroons are 



SPANISH 199 

now the specialties of many countries, with variations both in 
flavor (lemon, apple, coffee, chocolate, etc.) and in the nut of 
which the paste is made (almond, coconut and pistachio). In- 
deed, the Spanish macaroon is the type best known in this coun- 
try, for it is made only of almonds and hence called "almendra- 
dos." The oriental influence so prevalent in Spanish cooking 
is noted in the rosewater flavoring.

2 cups almonds 3 tablespoons grated lemon rind 

3 tablespoons granulated sugar 3 egg whites 

Grind almonds to a meal, add sugar, grated lemon rind, and

gredients lightly and put into a pastry bag with tube. Squeeze 
out in little twists on a buttered baking sheet and bake in a 
moderate oven (350 F.) until golden brown. 

DOUGHNUTS

work in the eggs, one at a time. Drop the batter by spoonfuls 
into deep hot fat and fry the doughnuts a rich brown. Drain on 
brown paper, brush with honey and roll in powdered sugar. 

At the fiestas of Spain the honeyed aroma of these tooth- 
some bufiuelos spices the air. They are as much a part of the 
great spring cattle fair as the empanads, pastellilos, goats, and

together to a smooth paste. Put a sheet of thick paper on a 
board, spread the paste over it to J^ inch in depth and cover 
with another sheet of paper. Put another board on top with 
a weight on it. When cold, cut into shapes.

204 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

SHERRY CREAM 

(Crema de Vino de Jerez) 

24 blanched almonds, ground 5 egg yolks 

fine l A cup cream 

1 cup milk Sugar to taste 

4 drops bitter almond extract y 2 cup sherry 

Stir ground almonds with milk and bring to a boil; add 

extract, and cool. When cold, add egg yolks, beaten well with 

the cream, sweeten to taste, and add sherry. Set mixture over 

the fire, heat, but do not allow to boil, stir one way until it 

thickens, then pour into cups or shallow glasses. Cool, and 

serve. 

SYRUP OF ORANGE 

(Jarabe de Naranja) 

Boil equal quantities of sugar and water to a thick syrup; 
clarify while boiling with the beaten white of an egg, and add 
fresh orange flowers or extract of orange. Violet, rose and 
various flower syrups are made in the same way. 

ALMOND ICE 

{Almendra Helado) 

Prepare almond milk same as in the recipe for almond re- 
fresher No. 1. Sugar to taste, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of orange 
flower water and freeze. 

ROSE SHERBET 
(Sorbete de Rosa) 

1 pint rose petals 1 quart boiling water 

2% cups granulated sugar 6 oranges 

Wash rose petals and pound them to a paste in a mortar, 
adding gradually J4 cup of sugar. Dissolve remaining sugar 
in boiling water and stir in the rose paste thoroughly. Then 



SPANISH 205 

boil 10' minutes, but do not stir. Allow mixture to cool and 
add the strained juice of the oranges. Freeze, and serve in 
punch glasses garnished with fresh rose petals. 

VIOLET SHERBET 
(S or bete de Violets) 

1 pint water 1 pint grape juice 

2 cups granulated sugar 1 egg white 

Juice of 2 lemons 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 

Fresh violets 

Mix water with sugar, boil for 10 minutes and add the 
strained lemon juice. Take from fire and allow to cool. Then 
add grape juice and freeze. When partly frozen open freezer, 
put in the egg white beaten with the powdered sugar. Serve in 
glasses on plates decorated with fresh violets. 

FROZEN MINT PUNCH 
(Ponche de Menta Helado) 

1 dozen mint leaves 1 quart water 

Yz cup granulated sugar Juice of 3 lemons 

Pound mint leaves to a paste in a mortar, adding % cup of 
the sugar gradually. Boil water and remaining sugar for 5 
minutes. Remove from fire, strain lemon juice and stir in mint 
paste. Cool and freeze. Leave punch in the freezer to season 
4 or 5 hours before serving. 



REFRESHING DRINKS 

(Refrescos) 



After luncheon and again after dinner a large proportion 
of the male population of Spain retire to the cafes and order 
black coffee or anis. Chocolate, served hot, thick and sweet, in 
small cups, is a favorite drink for cold days; and the cool, creamy 
horchata de chujas, made from almonds, or the roots of a rush- 
like plant that grows wild around Valencia, served in tall glasses, 
quenches the summer thirst. 

ALMOND REFRESHER NO. 1 

{Horchata) 

l /i pound raw blanched almonds Yi pound roasted almonds 
Powdered sugar 

Pound almonds to a paste in a mortar, adding a little water 
from time to time during the process to keep from oiling. Then 
add more water and put the paste into a cheese cloth, wringing 
it to extract the juice. Repeat the process of pounding, adding 
water, and squeeze again. Add sugar to taste and ice for a 
refreshing drink. Pumpkin and melon seeds are treated in the 
same way, to make a similar creamy beverage. 

ALMOND REFRESHER NO. 2 

Run almonds through a grinder, mix well with 4 times their 
bulk in water and let stand an hour. Then pass through a 
cheese cloth, pounding and squeezing out the moisture. This 
makes an almond cream to which water, powdered sugar and 

206 



SPANISH 207 

ice are added. In the same way a drink is made of hazel nuts 
or filberts. 

ORANGE FLOWER DRINK 

{Rejresco Flor de Naranja) 

Juice of 2 oranges l / 2 cup gin 

Powdered sugar 2 tablespoons flower water 

Put the juice of the oranges, powdered sugar to taste, and 
gin into the cocktail shaker. Add flower water. Shake with 
cracked ice and serve in champagne glasses. 

FROZEN SPANISH PUNCH 
(Ponche Espahol) 

Juice 6 lemons 1 pint Rioja, red wine 

Thin rind of 2 lemons l / 2 nutmeg, grated 

3 cups sugar syrup 1 cup water 

Mix ingredients and strain into freezer. Freeze; and during 
the process scrape down with a spatula the ice that forms on the 
sides. When the punch becomes a slushy snow, just liquid 
enough to run, pour into glasses and serve. Frosted glasses make 
the drink seem all the colder. 

ARROPA 

This is a favorite beverage in the great grape sections of 
Spain. It is made with new wine boiled down to a thick syrup, 
then diluted, sweetened and spiced to taste. Can be drunk either 
hot or cold. 



THE BASQUE KITCHEN 



The Basques, whose country was anciently called Euskaria, 
are the oldest and most colorful race in Europe. Living to 
themselves in the lofty Pyrenees, they have come through almost 
unspoiled by civilization. Shepherds, sailors, farmers, they are 
a lusty race, fond of music, wine and good living, as are all 
highlanders. They carry wine with them wherever they go, in 
sheepskin bags, slung over the shoulder. When they are thirsty 
they simply pull the tiny wooden plug from the nozzle, hold 
it high overhead and aim the jet of wine unerringly into their 
mouths. Sometimes a bit of wool gets into the wine, or, after 
a hot march, it takes on a flavor of mutton broth, but they are 
hardy mountaineers with man-sized thirsts and appetites to 
keep them well above such petty matters. 

Although they occupy the borderland between Spain and 
France, they maintain a cuisine as emphatically their own as 
are their medieval costumes, ornate and elegant. Natty velvet 
jackets and knee breeches of silk with silver filigree buttons 
jangling in bunches from velours vests and ribbon garters are 
their native garb. Though they combine farming and moun- 
taineering, they are celebrated fisherfolk as well, for the finest 
fish in Europe are caught in the Biscay Bay, salubrious shellfish, 
too, crabs, lobsters and sea spiders. 

Grilled royans on toast is a Basque specialty, and the recipe 
is simplicity itself: Roll fresh, cleaned sardines in olive oil, salt 
and pepper. Grill and serve on buttered toast. 

208 



SPANISH 209 

Royans are small and tender sardines native to the Bay of 
Biscay, but any sort of sardines, including big California pil- 
chards, are toothsome when grilled and served in this manner. 
Buttered toast is uncommon in Spain itself, where cows are 
so scarce that butter has to be imported in tins from Scandinavia, 
but Basqueland is exceptional in having rich milk for both 
butter and cheese. Therefore, less olive oil is used than in 

Andalusia. 

BASQUE SOUP 

Potatoes, beans and garlic boiled together. Slices of dry 
bread spread with mashed potatoes, thickly dusted with grated 
cheese. These are placed in the soup plates and the puree 
poured over them. Then a palmful of pitted olives is sprinkled 
over all. 

While the local ways of preparing fish are individual, the 
standard method is to simmer them in scant olive oil, with onion 
and garlic, spiced with red pepper, garnished with parsley, and 
served either on bread or buttered toast. Codfish is as popular 
here as in Portugal, and the following recipe will do either for 
fresh or salt cod: 

COD BISCAYENNE 

6 shallots, chopped 2 raw potatoes, sliced thin 

2 cloves of garlic, chopped 2 tomatoes, peeled and sliced 

2 tablespoons olive oil 1 green pepper, chopped 

2 pounds cod, shredded Salt and pepper 

1 cup water 

Saute shallots and garlic in the olive oil for 5 minutes; do 
not let them brown. Add cod and mix thoroughly. If using 
salt cod, allow to soak in cold water several hours before using. 
Place y 2 of the cod mixture in the bottom of a casserole. On 
top of the fish place a layer of potato and tomato slices and the 
chopped pepper. Season and cover with remainder of the fish. 



210 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Add water, cover and bake in a moderate oven (350°?.) for 1 
hour. This makes 8 to 10 servings. 

The typical Basque sauce is Piperrade, "peppery" in transla- 
tion. Hot and spicy, often enriched by eggs, it makes a piquant 
vegetable melange. The codfish recipe shows that this cuisine 
also follows the southern chives-shallot-leek-onion-garlic route. 
Its most distinguishing characteristic, however, is the use of 
peppers in everything. A piperrade omelet is smothered in 
minced sweet peppers and tomatoes lightly browned in olive oil. 

EGGS BASQUE 

4 large green peppers Salt and pepper 

4 eggs 2 cups cooked rice 

1 cup tomato sauce 

Parboil the peppers for 5 minutes. Drain, remove skin, cut 
off the stem end and remove seeds and membranes. Place 
each pepper in a buttered cup with the cut end up. In each 
drop an tgg and sprinkle with seasoning. Place the cups in 
a pan of hot water and bake in moderate oven (350°?.) until 
the eggs are set, about 5 to 10 minutes. When done remove 
peppers and place in nests of boiled rice. Surround with tomato 
sauce. Brown gravy or cream sauce may be substituted. This 
makes 4 servings. 

Since these highlands have a long and severe winter, nearly 
everything is pickled, to last out the unproductive season. Pi- 
mentos, sliced tomatoes and olives, stoned, as well as all game 
and fowl go into the confit jar: quail, wild pigeons, goose, duck, 
chicken and turkey, and many a native recipe calls for a joint 
from the jar. The Euskarians make their own pate de foie gras, 
flavored with onion, white wine and brandy. Many dishes are 
stimulated by burning brandy over them — fish, rabbit, omelet 
and cheese dishes. 



SPANISH 



211 



One of the favorite fish dishes thus prepared is made with 
squid. Calamare is the Spanish name for squid, chipirones is 
the Basque name. Squid and octopus are much the same; the 
latter has 8 tentacles, while the former has 10. It is interesting 
to note that these water animals have little sacs containing a 
black liquid. In life, when attacked, the animal uses a discharge 
of this dark substance, called "ink," under cover of which it 
escapes. The Italians and Spaniards are very fond of cooking 
squid, body, tentacles and ink-sac all together. They think 
the ink-sac lends piquancy to the dish, but some prefer to have 
the sac removed. 



CHIPIRONES A LA GUIPUZCOANE 



i pound squid 
3 tablespoons olive oil 
2 onions, chopped 
"Ink" from squid 



Dash of salt 

Dash of cayenne 

i tablespoon apple brandy 

4 to 6 slices toast 



Dice tentacles, heads and bodies of squid, discarding "bones"; 
carefully cutting loose the ink sac, intact, for future use. Heat 
olive oil and slowly fry the squid and onions in it until brown. 
Rupture the ink sac, add ink, cover and simmer until fish is 
tender, about 2 hours. Add seasoning and apple brandy. Serve 
on toast. The brandy may be poured over each serving and 
burned, if desired. This makes 4 to 6 servings. 

For Chipirones a la Labourdine, use only head and tentacles 
of squid, mix with chopped ham, bread crumbs, onion, parsley 
and minced garlic; fry in plenty of olive oil. Lay this mixture 
on the "bones," and simmer in olive oil. Take up with a 
perforated slice, and serve very hot. 

These dishes from the Basque region bear names from the 
regional dialect. 



212 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Basque sausages are well peppered and seasoned with garlic. 
The celebrated spicy Loukenkas is hotter even than Spanish 
Chorizos. This sausage is grilled and served with raw oysters, 
and what could be tastier than that? Other specialties are mush- 
room fritters, smoked ox tongues, raw hams, potted pork, and 
dishes distinguished by goose drippings and a wrapping of 
cabbage leaves. 

BAKED EGGPLANT SALAD 

i large eggplant % cup wine vinegar 

i tablespoon sharp mustard Salt and pepper 

% cup olive oil Head of lettuce 

Cut eggplant in half lengthwise and bake in a moderate 
oven (35o°F.) for 30 minutes or until tender. Peel and dice. 
Marinate in a mixture of the sharp mustard, oil, vinegar and 
seasonings. Place in a refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Serve 
in lettuce cups. This makes 6 to 8 servings. 

PORK BISCAYENNE 

A 4-pound loin of pork 3 cups milk 

3 tablespoons fat Salt and pepper 

Brown the loin of pork in the fat, then cover with milk and 
simmer slowly, covered, for 2 to 3 hours. Sprinkle with season- 
ings when half cooked. 

Saddle of lamb and veal are nicely roasted on the spit before 
the most unique grate fire in the world. Since these picturesque 
highlanders are pretty well snowed in most of the winter, their 
kitchens are much cozier than those in the rest of Spain. As 
in the Italian countryside, the kitchen here is the most popular 
and comfortable room in the house, with its blazing straw fire, 
three-legged iron cooking pots and hand-hammered tongs, bulg- 
ing casks of wine, jars of pickles and confits, sound cheeses, 
hams, sausages, and strings of handy herbs. 



SPANISH 213 

One entire wall of the stone kitchen is given over to the fire; 
it is a fireplace rather than a wall. Straw is packed neatly into 
the space stretching from one room-corner to another and reach- 
ing all the way from floor to ceiling. The fire-surface of the 
packed straw is cut off neatly, and sometimes it covers a hundred 
square feet. A match is applied to the bottom straw and the 
whole side of the kitchen leaps up in a blaze. The fire, however, 
is steady and easily controlled, for the straw is so closely and 
cleverly packed that it burns slowly and evenly, the hot ashes 
sifting down gradually to form a perfect bed of coals in which 
the gypsy-legged pots stand simmering on their stilts well above 
the cinders. No lamp is needed in such a well lighted room, 
where one feels as though he were on the inside of an oven, 
getting slowly baked through with the golden glow from the 
fire and a handy flagon of wine. 

As in all hard-drinking countries, few sweets are in demand, 
and those of the Basques are invariably flavored with almonds. 
Their macaroons and almond pastes are beyond compare and, 
too, the tiny almond biscuits called Croquignolles de Navarra. 
They also make a soft and creamy nougat and juicy candied 
fruits. 

Of cheeses there are but three, one a soft milk cheese like 
Port-Salut, called Urt; the second a ewe cheese, and the third 
one made with cream. White wines to go with them are of three 
kinds: Irouleguy, first class; Churi Seratis, second; and several 
of the ordinary type, Bidarray, Osses, Itxassou and Louhassos, 
both white and red. There are aguardientes, ardent spirits, or 
fire-water, aplenty, similar to Hendaye Liqueur on the French 
border, all flavored with salubrious herbs gathered in the high 
Pyrenees. There is apple brandy, too, for flavoring squid, 
omelets, meats and an occasional festive almond pudding.

O JANTAR ESTA NA MESA 

{The dinner is on the table — the formal announcement in 
Portugal for "Dinner is served.") 



Because Portugal is such a steep narrow strip of land along 
the Atlantic it has to cling to its rocky coast like a crab and 
wrest its living likewise from the sea itself. Besides the fishing 
industry this country, still known by its ancient name Lusitania, 
lives by making wines, chiefly port, and by marketing the vinous 
specialties of its colonies, the islands of Madeira and the Azores. 
In consequence of these two national activities, the Portuguese 
knows his fish and wine even better than the Britisher knows his 
fish and chips. The Lisboner can have oysters before every meal 
if he likes and wash them down with dry golden Madeira, 
besides. Having been once a part of Spain, the cuisine of 
Portugal is somewhat influenced by its past, and as with Spain 
itself, there are oriental overtones to many dishes. Hordes of 
Moors long ago deserted North Africa to settle among the Latins 
on this rocky strip of seacoast, and they brought along the ancient 
cooking arts of Arabia, their conquerors as well as Spain's and 
Portugal's. So we find stuffed cucumbers, melons, almonds even 
in the soup, and oriental rice. But Portugal long ago left her 
imprint on Eastern cooking, in exchange, as the result of early 
voyages to India and the Orient, where she introduced bread, 
which is still known there as pao, or pan. Another of her con- 
tributions abroad was the cooking of shrimps tempura style, 
which is the favorite mode of Japan down to this day. Portu- 
guese colonies in the East, Angola and Macao, continue this 
connection between occidental and oriental dishes. The Portu- 

217 



218 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

guese, in fact, are almost as fond of rice as the Chinese them- 
selves. 

The cooking of Lusitania is also influenced by France, where 
the nobility of Lisbon and Oporto have always sojourned; and 
by Italy, whose language is indeed closer to Portuguese than 
Spanish itself. But more than any other influence, the Brazilians 
have added their fruits and eating fashions to the mother country 
that governed Brazil through the Emperors Dom Pedro I and 
II down until 1889. Just as Cortes took chocolate to Spain from 
Mexico and it became the national eye-opener, so early Portu- 
guese travellers returned to Lisbon in ships laden with rich 
Brazilian coffee, mellow sugar and rum. Soon the two shores 
of the Atlantic were so close that the Portuguese and Brazilian 
cuisines were scarcely distinguishable. Portugal learned to cook 
bananas and eat goibada, the guava jelly that is Brazil's national 
dessert, and before long she was putting coconut in everything 
and sprinkling snowy mandioca meal on black beans a Brazileira. 

But in spite of all these out-land influences the cooking of 
Portugal remains basically native, and as marine as that of 
Scandinavia. In place of the chicken-and-egg diet of mother 
Spain, Lusitania subsists on lobster and fish roe, oysters, shrimp 
and whitebait. This North Atlantic whitebait is eel spawn, so 
fat and toothsome that no other can compare with it. In the 
seaports it is eaten as commonly as spaghetti in Naples; and 
oddly enough, when boiled white and plump this eel whitebait 
resembles the Neapolitan staff of life. 

Oysters sometimes begin both main meals, and are so plenti- 
ful that the over-production is shipped to England and France, 
where this luscious bivalve is distinguished from all others by 
its delicate sea green tint. The bulk of oysters consumed in 
France are Portugaises de Claire and selected Verts Portugaises. 

Shrimp are as common here as mosquitoes in New Jersey. 
They go into most sauces and accompany lobster every day in 



PORTUGUESE 219 

every way. Both of these crickets of the deep, boiled red, appear 
alongside the ever present sardine in the characteristic national 
bouquet do mar, which is more of a seafood cornucopia than a 
bouquet, for it is crammed to overflowing with mussels, octopi, 
ray, squid, eel, crabs, cod and any other foolish fish that swims 
close enough to the craggy coast to be caught. 

Cod-fish (bacalhao) is the marine mainstay, and one of the 
country's leading products. In Brazil the Portuguese are com- 
monly called "sellers of cod," or more frankly just "cod-fish," 
even as the Brazilians in turn are called "monkeys" by their 
Argentine neighbors. The catch is salted down after being split 
through the middle, flattened out, rubbed with salt and then 
dried so that it resembles a kite or a jib sail. Every kitchen has 
its codfish flapping in a corner and hunks are cut handily off 
it to plop into the soup or stew or to be more respectfully treated 
as the piece de resistance. Salt cod grilled, and seasoned with 
Portuguese olive oil, wine vinegar and a palmful of whole garlic 
cloves, peeled, is something to write home about. A touch of 
garlic and the whole world grins, but only to show its ignorance. 

The day's menu of Portugal is quite as vinous as Spain's, 
though the wines are not nearly so good, excepting port, which 
is specially fortified and sometimes flavored for export to Eng- 
land. The anis liqueur of Spain is replaced by white rum from 
Brazil, and this is often drunk before breakfast, especially by 
the hardy fisherfolk. The first meal of the day is meager enough, 
perhaps the plainest of continental breakfasts. It is called just 
cafe, and consists of little more than the ebony Brazilian coffee 
percolated through a muslin sack — or if no sack is handy, a 
clean sock will do. A chunk of bread goes with the coffee, 
butter or not, for cream is as scarce in Portugal as in Spain, 
and consequently its best cheese, Traz-os-Montes, is made of 
ewe's milk. 

Meals are, of course, a matter of money, so the city elect 



220 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

of Lisbon and Oporto sometimes breakfast better, but the bulk 
of Portuguese subsist by manual labor, the men hauling nets 
or tending the fields, the women gutting and preserving the fish 
or working alongside their men on the farm. Rising before 
dawn to get busy in the old-time Ben Franklin fashion, naturally 
there is little dallying over breakfast. In the cities, too, the 
women do most of the work, dressed in jaunty pancake hats 
they even conduct the street cars. The fishwives of Lisbon are 
as famous as the herring women of Scotland, and as strong 
smelling. Waggish mermaids ashore, they get themselves up 
gaudily in flat bonnets sometimes trimmed with sea-shells, 
anemones, starfish, coral or seaweed, always picturesque, from 
acid green shoulder shawl to colorful sea-wetted skirt. They 
lug around great baskets of dripping whitebait or sardines, go 
hawking them up and down the residential hills, setting up 
raucous siren cries and hurling oaths for caresses at one another. 
Or they load a cart with soggy baskets of the morning catch 
from the scaly deep and propel them by donkey power to the 
canning factories. Shrimps and cod are their special care, once 
the men drag their nets ashore. Expertly the women gut and 
preserve the shining, flipping mess, setting aside all smaller fry 
of little commercial value to take home and feast upon, as do 
the Maine fishermen who have thereby come to believe that 
baby lobsters and even tender minnows are the tastiest of sea- 
fruit. 

Besides being blasphemous, these voluble Lusitanian fish- 
wives are very religious. Saint Anthony is their patron, and 
oddly enough he protects both fishermen and cooks alike. In 
every seacoast town there is a shrine to this saint who does double 
service, and there the temporarily widowed fish wives rush at 
the first sign of an approaching storm to drop on their knees in 
fish-scaly skirts and pray for the safe return of their mates out 
of the angry sea. 



PORTUGUESE 221 

A wooden or plaster statue of Antonio, as the saint is called 
at home, is set on every kitchen shelf to beam his benign bless- 
ings down on the concoction of the day's fish chowder. He 
counts the onions and carrots that go into the stew and stays the 
cook's hand when just the right amount of pepper has been 
added. So if the dish doesn't turn out exactly right it is Santo 
Antonio's holy fault and the housewife hotly yanks the saint 
down from his perch, turns him up like a bad boy and spanks 
him with her slipper for the failure. If a dish burns or dis- 
pleases the master she takes Antonio out to the well and hangs 
him head down in it, in dire disgrace — for the fault is obviously 
his and never hers. 

Lunch along this craggy seacoast begins more often than 
not with delectable raw oysters, fresh from the clear waters of 
the sea, served in their shells with lemon and pepper fresh- 
ground from the wooden mill on the table. But inland, espe- 
cially in towns, the standard appetite opener is fiambres, frios, 
or cold cuts, taking the place of the more elaborate Spanish 
entremesas; sliced native salamis always, radishes, olives, fresh 
butter on a lettuce leaf, sardines and shrimp, with plenty of 
pepper sauce, mustard and peppy condiments. And by the way, 
the pepper sauce of Portugal is not to be sneezed at. It comes 
via Brazil, and is quickly prepared at the table, for it is simply 
red and green chilis mashed into fresh juice of limes preferably, 
or lemons, with a wooden spoon. A trickle of this stimulating 
sauce goes into everything. 

The name of the midday meal is almoco, which proves its 
twinship with the Hispanic almuerzo, but fish here often takes 
precedence over the Spanish egg dishes, and both are combined 
in shrimp or oyster omelets. Fish in all fashions, from broiled 
bacalhao (codfish) through peixe escabeche (pickled fish), to 
linguado (sole) with shrimp sauce. Then eggs or not. Bifes 
follow, of course, mostly cooked with onion, and varied by pork, 



222 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

veal and mutton on occasion. Chicken in aspic, young turkey 
stuffed with chestnut dressing, or preferably a game-bird pie, 
pastelao de cacabrava. Wines white and red, drunk in as great 
quantity as in Spain, though the ordinary ones are inferior in 
quality and variety. 

Dry Bucellas (similar to Rhine wine), or Collares are the 
favorite whites, with rivals in Arinto, Termo, Carcavellos. Both 
sweet and dry wines are produced in the vicinity of Lisbon and 
exported in the name of this capital city, though locally they are 
known as Palmella and Inglezhinos (little English ones). Bucel- 
las closely resembles Rhine wine because it is grown on vines 
originally transplanted from the Rhineland. 

The vin ordinaire, or vinho do pais, is labeled Consumo. It 
grows in the Douro valley near the Alto Douro, where the 
celebrated port wines are produced. It is a natural dry red of 
low price that stands shipment well, has a flavor all its own, 
similar to Montpellier from which eau-de-vie is made in France. 
Among the best known table' reds are Collares, Lavradio, 
Lamego, Torres Vedras and Moncaon; but the Portuguese them- 
selves have a palate for young wines, called vinho verde, green 
wine, or for vinho virgem, virgin wine, that comes in large 
clay bottles and is seldom shipped abroad. The taste for them 
must be acquired, the same as a taste for Spanish manzanilla, 
young white sherry, though as a matter of fact it is almost neces- 
sary to put in a full day at hard manual labor in order to 
develop a thirst for such strong, crude potations. 

Late in the afternoon these astringent wines of peculiar 
flavor, fixed up with herbs and spirits, are sometimes drunk as 
aperitifs, but more often local brandy or Brazilian rum is gulped 
down in the bars with sapid empadinhas all in one bite. These 
empadinhas are succulent pasties filled with olives, bits of fish, 
game, mushrooms, any luscious tidbit surrounded by juicy gravy 
and enclosed in pie crust. They are a considerable refinement 



PORTUGUESE 223 

of the individual pork, veal and bird pies served flabby and 
cold in London pubs. "Muito saboroso," very savoury, say the 
Portuguese, downing another almost without tasting it. They 
are served piping, as their brother empanadas of Spain, from a. 
special hot-box standing beside the bar, and some of the sea-food 
concoctions are beyond compare; one is a tantalizing bite of 
boiled shrimp enclosed in melodious golden batter mixed with 
the essence of olive. Distinctive and delicious — a cut above our 
own soggy canapes. 

In the Northern ports a sea oddity serves as a "piece" be- 
tween meals. This is a meaty mussel torn from its hiding place 
among submerged rocks by the bushel and consumed raw by 
the plateful, even as orisons, sea urchins, are, all along the 
Mediterranean. The Portuguese mussel is about the length, 
thickness and shape of your forefinger, but it looks more like a 
leg, a tiny stuffed doll's leg. Its fleshy marrow is encased in a 
black silken stocking that ends in a polished patent leather boot, 
its shell, worn neatly and the exact shape of a shoe. To eat this 
exceptional bit of sea-food the stocking must be first rolled down 
to get at the shapely white calf that tastes something like 
scallops. Beside its salt sea succulency the sea urchin of the 
Mediterranean is a mere nose-thumbing gamin. There is a 
Cinderella stateliness and charm about this sea leg that mellows 
the accompanying wine itself, though sometimes the shining 
black stockings are sadly wrinkled, for want of garters. 

At dinner time, jantar, as the last meal of the day is called, 
the oyster-gorger falls to with lemon and pepper-grinder again. 
If he has no nonsense about him and hasn't been affected by 
the foreign beer and aperitifs of Lisbon and Oporto he will dine 
at a native restaurant in the hearty style of Portuguez antiga, 
in an old-time atmosphere as homey as an Italian kitchen. The 
tables are served by waiters in fancy vests and shirt sleeves, a 
respected custom even encouraged by past kings and princes.

houses, where the diner feels free to go first to the kitchen, lift 
the pot lids, savor his dish and consult the cook. The floor is 
kept freshly sawdusted, like English chop houses of old. Noth- 
ing ritzy here, and yet no better menu at the Ritz: 

Appetizer: Dry tawny Madeira 

Bread soup 

A pie of beef, bacon and crisp snips of pork 

Cod boiled with potatoes and onions, decorated with shrimps 
grilled in their jackets, and melted butter sauce 

White Wine 

Pig's head in aspic 

Wild duck with wild rice Sliced oranges 

Red Wine 

Sonhos (Dreams, Cream puffs) 
Ice cream Fruits 

Cheese: Traz os Montes, or requeijao, a half dried curd, also of 
mutton milk, wrapped in a fresh green leaf 

Black coffee Cognac 

Liqueurs 

A meaty meal and also a fairly intoxicating one, from the 
variety of drinks served with it. 

Pork in some form appears at every jantar. It is most ap- 
plauded when it comes on roasted at a tender, suckling age, 
then known as leitao. The name itself was taken in early days 
by a proud and prolific family of Lusitania who still own one 
of the leading department stores in Rio de Janeiro, Casa Leitao. 
It is well known that the Romans started the custom of taking 
to themselves as surnames the names of their favorite fowls, 



PORTUGUESE 225 

game and foods. The Portuguese being first cousins to the 
Romans, followed suit. 

In the "Arte de Cosinha," Portugal's classic cook book, Joao 
da Matta points this out, saying it must be so, since the country 
swarms with gentry named Messrs. Duck, Guinea-hen, Sheep, 
Lamprey, Codfish, Sausage, Chicken, Pigeon, etc., yet not one of 
them is named after the kangaroo, elephant, monkey, lion or 
any other animal that the Portuguese don't actually eat. 

The wines for dinner are those already named for lunch, 
though better vintages are usually served at night. With the 
dessert, often consisting of the distinguished grapes from which 
port itself is made, or the favorite preserved apricots, sweet white 
wines of Setuval and Grandjo come on. The Setuval is a Muscat 
and the Grandjo is Portugal's finest Sauterne. Portuguese cham- 
pagne is no better than Spain's, so those who can afford it drink 
French. Port, of course, is not drunk in Portugal. It is looked 
upon with the same condescension or disdain as that with which 
the French contemplate their sparkling Burgundy, manufactured 
exclusively for export. For as a matter of fact the port doctored 
up for shipment to England bears but little resemblance to the 
natural article after it has been doped with elderberries powdered 
and dried, reinforced with 20% brandy by volume and colored 
with quebracho extract, from Brazil wood, which also gives to 
Argentine wines a rich, ruby color but an awfully bad reputa- 
tion at home. Much of the natural ruby of port, however, comes 
from long treading of the grape-must in the vats. The Portu- 
guese go about this treading as heartily as turkey cocks. They 
bathe well before diving naked into the wine vats, and then 
line up in dance figures, four to eight men doing intricate 
grape-squashing quadrilles with abandon, for orchestras of 
guitars, pipes, hautboys, bag-pipes even, are actually hired by 
vineyard proprietors to keep the wine-pressing boys at their 
rhythmic grape-dancing four hours at a stretch, while the fore- 
man of the shift sings out the figures. 



SOUPS 

(Sop as) 



SOUP OF A THOUSAND INFANTS 

(Sopa de Mil Infantes) 

i quart chicken broth % cup bread crumbs 

Salt and pepper l /z teaspoon minced

Skim off fat. Serve with a piece of chicken in each soup plate. 

The chicken and rice soup of Brazil is called canja, literally 
rice-cream. Brazilians are as fond of this dish as we are of ice 

226 



PORTUGUESE 227 

cream. Its name has been incorporated into their language and 
is heard every day in the exclamation "E canja!" "It's easy!" 
Easy to do, easy money, anything "nice and soft" as we would 
say. In Portugal and Brazil "E sopa!" is used in exactly the 
same way. "It's the soup!" Our "easy as pie" is its synonym. 

SHRIMP SOUP 

{Sopa de Camarao) 

1 pound shrimp 1 small onion, chopped 

iYz quarts boiling water x /i garlic clove, minced 

Salt 6 sorrel leaves, chopped

228 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

of the hot milk to the almond paste, mixing with a wooden 

spoon, and pass through a fine sieve, adding more milk, as 

necessary, to rub all through sieve. Put mixture in double boiler 

and cook 15-20 minutes, stirring constantly with wooden spoon. 

Add remaining hot milk, season with salt and then with a little 

sugar. Add butter. Lay croutons in hot tureen and pour soup 

over. 

PRINCES' CHOWDER

pepper, and salt. Add oysters with their liquor and simmer 
until they crinkle. Add lemon juice and serve, putting a bit 
of each fish and sea food in each serving. (The mussels are to 
be thrown away.) 

This dish is all the tastier if cooked with sea water, accord- 
ing to the practice of coastal Portuguese.

2 3 o THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

(C) 

Half an hour before the preceding meat and vegetable soups 
are ready soak 2 slices bread, without crust, in broth from the 
beef pot. Mash bread to paste, add 2 cups broth and cook with 
6 mint leaves and a blade of mace until thick. Remove mint 
and mace, and pour in bottom of a hot soup tureen. 

Drain vegetables and save liquid. Slice sausage, cut cabbage 
in portions, dice turnips, carrots, and celery root. Lay the barley 
on top of the bread puree in the tureen. Then lay in half the 
turnips, carrots, celery, beans and peas, followed by the sliced 
sausage and the rest of the vegetables, reserving the cabbage and 
squash for the top. Skim fat from meat broth, mix with vege- 
table broth, and pour mixture of the two broths gently into 
tureen. Lay beef on a platter and garnish with salt pork and 
ham, to be cut in portions and served with soup. Serve a dish 
of tomato sauce on the side to be added to soup as desired.

i (2-pound) fresh water fish 2 tablespoons olive oil 

Salt 1 tablespoon flour 

1 small onion, chopped 1 Yi cups sea food or fish broth 

54 garlic clove, minced 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 

! /4 bay leaf 1 tablespoon minced parsley 

% teaspoon pepper Buttered crumbs 

Salt the fish after cleaning, and set it aside for 1 hour; then 
wash and dry with a cloth. Lay it in a baking dish and com- 
mence baking. Meanwhile have ready this sauce: Fry onion, 
garlic, bay leaf and pepper in olive oil without browning. Add 
flour and stir. Add heated fish broth and vinegar, stir and 
simmer until quite thick, salting to taste. After baking 8 
minutes remove fish from oven and mask thickly with the 
sauce. Sprinkle evenly with parsley, and then with the crumbs. 
Return to the oven and bake until fish is tender and crumbs are 
brown. If any of the sauce is left over lay it around the fish 

and serve. 

FISH LUSITANIA STYLE 

(Pescada a Lusitana) 

Y 2 pound fish 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan 

2 cups mashed potatoes cheese 

Salt and pepper Butter 

1 egg yolk, beaten 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

From the tail end of a fish have slices cut the thickness of a 
fifty-cent coin, removing bones. Have ready the mashed potatoes, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and mixed well with egg yolk 
and Parmesan cheese. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a baking 
pan, and stir into it the lemon juice. Season fish slices with 
salt and pepper and lay side by side in the pan. Mask each 
slice with a thick layer of mashed potatoes, neatly smoothing 



PORTUGUESE 233 

with a knife repeatedly dipped in melted butter. Place in a 
moderate oven (350° F.) for about 10 minutes, or until fish is 
cooked and potatoes are golden brown. The name of this dish 
is derived from the ancient Latin, Lusitania, for the land that 
is now Portugal. 

FISHWIFE'S STEW 
{Caldeirada a Pescadora) 

2 pounds assorted fish, sliced 1 dozen sorrel leaves (optional) 

(such as flounder, bass and 1 bay leaf 

blackfish) 1 teaspoon minced parsley 

l A cup olive oil 1 tablespoon vinegar 

1 onion, sliced 1V2 cups white wine 

1 garlic clove, crushed Salt and pepper 

2 tomatoes, peeled and sliced Thinly sliced stale bread 

Lay fish slices in saucepan, add oil, vegetables, herbs, vinegar 
and wine and shake pan to mix evenly. Season. Bring to a 
boil, cover closely and simmer 15 minutes. Cover bottom of 
a casserole with bread slices, lay fish on top and pour pan con- 
tents over. Cover closely and set over very slow heat for 15 
minutes. Serve in the casserole. 

Caldeirada a Pescadora should be cooked on the high poop 
of a Portuguese fishing boat, by a brawny, nut-brown fisherman, 
or his wife, with the odors of the herbs mingling with the clear- 
ing sea mist of early morning to whet an appetite already raven- 
ous from strenuous fishing. Anything from net or hook may 
go into the earthenware olha — eel or ray as well as the choice 
of the catch — sole, roballo (sturgeon) or salmonete (red-mullet). 
The cooking fire should, by rights, be slow charcoal burning in 
a low iron brazier.

the fish. 

SHRIMP CROQUETTES 

(Croquettes de Camarbes) 

i onion, sliced 2 eggs 

1 garlic clove, minced 12 large shrimp, chopped 

1 tablespoon butter Salt and pepper 

1 teaspoon chopped parsley Flour 

1 slice dry bread Bread crumbs 

1 tablespoon milk Deep fat for frying 

Fry onion and garlic in butter until light brown and tender. 
Add parsley, moistened bread, milk, 1 beaten cgg y shrimp, sea- 
sonings and enough flour to bind. Mold into oval shapes and 
allow to cool thoroughly. Dip in beaten egg } then in crumbs and 
fry in deep fat. 

This is one of the dishes taken by Portuguese traders, 
centuries ago, to Japan, where, with slight modifications, it is 
made to this day, under the name "Tempura," which identifies 
the frying in batter, rather than the shrimp, for lobsters and 
other delicacies of the sea are cooked by the same recipe. 

SHRIMPS FRIED IN BATTER

Yz hour; drain. Make a batter with flour, egg white and yolk, 
1 teaspoon olive oil, and enough tepid water to thin. Run tooth- 
picks through the shrimp so they are skewered together in groups 
of four or five. Dip the groups of shrimp into batter until com : 
pletely covered. Fry in deep fat. Drain on absorbent paper. 
Sprinkle with parsley, and serve with quartered lemons. 

BROWNED SHRIMPS 

(Camarbes Torados) 

Choose large fresh shrimps; wash well, letting them lie in 
cold water until free of all sand. Dry well in a linen towel. 
Have ready enough hot olive oil in a pan to make a depth of 
half the thickness of a shrimp. Heat to smoking point; drop 
in shrimps, one by one, turning them often until they are done. 
Lay on brown paper in a hot place to drain. Sprinkle with salt 
and pepper. Serve on a hot platter. They are shelled at the 
table. The larger the shrimps are, the better. In Brazil, where 
gourmets gorge on camaroes torados em casca, the best local 
shrimp, browned in their shells, are netted at the full of the 
moon, are almost as large and luscious as baby lobsters. Don't 
try this dish with English prawns or you'll be vexed.

i pound sirloin or tenderloin i cube beef suet 

(sliced thin) Bread crumbs, sifted 

Salt and pepper Grated Parmesan cheese 

i tablespoon lemon juice 2 eggs, beaten 

Lard for frying 

Be sure all skin and fat have been removed from meat. Cut 
in equal pieces about 3 inches in diameter. Sprinkle each piece 
lightly on both sides, with salt, freshly ground pepper, and drops 
of lemon juice. Slice suet and try out the fat. Mix crumbs with 
equal quantity of Parmesan cheese. Dip meat in hot fat and 
then in crumb mixture, carefully covering both sides. Pile up, 
one piece on top of the other, in a neat stack and set aside for 
at least 1 hour. Then carefully dip each piece in beaten egg, 
and then in crumbs. Have lard hot, and fry until tender. 

MINCED BEEF 
{Picada) 

1 pound roast beef, minced Cayenne 

l / 2 pint gravy Hot cooked rice 

Y& teaspoon nutmeg Baked tomato halves 

Make a hash of minced beef and gravy, season with nutmeg 
and cayenne. Press rice into buttered small molds and unmold. 
Arrange in a ring on a platter, put a baked tomato half on each 
mold of rice. Pour hash into the center of platter. 

This arrangement of boiled rice and tomatoes is known 
throughout the cooking world as Portuguese garnishing, and is 
a tempting accompaniment to many a meat dish, from a roast 
leg of lamb to a platter of dainty chops. 

A French dish cooked "a la Portugaise" is one cooked either 
with a bed or a cover of forcemeat or chopped meat.

MEAT FLOWERS 
(Flor de Came Estujada) 

For Each Flower: 2 tablespoons white meat, 
1 thin slice uncooked beef minced 

Sorrel leaves, without stems Salt and pepper 

(or young spinach) l / 2 hard-boiled egg 

1 thin circle uncooked ham Portuguese cooking sauce 

1 thin omelet, egg yolks only Lettuce for garnishing 
1 thin slice cooked smoked 
tongue 

Pile ingredients, except sauce and lettuce, like a stack of pan- 
cakes in the order given, each layer being very thin, and all of 
the same circumference except the egg half which crowns the 
pile, white side up. With needle and strong thread, make a gath- 
ering around the edge of the beef. Stretch and work edges of 
beef upward, at the same time pressing the pile down in the cen- 
ter until beef surrounds other ingredients like the calyx of a 
flower enfolding its petals. Draw thread tight and tie. This 
forms a ball the size of an orange, with the white of the egg 
showing in the exact center of the top. Lay as many of these 
balls as desired in a saucepan, add boiling Portuguese cooking 
sauce made without tomato (see recipe) to half the height of 
the balls. Simmer, turning occasionally. Take up, remove 
thread and serve on lettuce with egg next to lettuce. With a 
very sharp knife, cut meat ball down to the level of the egg 
yolk in 6 equal sections. Gently open the sections and a flower 
of many colored petals will be formed by the contrasting 
layers of beef, sorrel, omelet, tongue and white meat. The egg 
half holds these petals together at the base and its yolk makes a 
daisy-like center for the flower. Reduce cooking liquid and serve 
in a gravy boat.

SADDLE OF MUTTON 

(Quadrado de Carneiro) 



Saddle of mutton 

2 quarts port wine 

2 cups meat broth 

2 cups wine vinegar 

6 cloves 

2 bay leaves 

6 allspice 



6 peppercorns 

2 onions, sliced 

2 carrots, chopped 

1 young turnip, chopped 

1 garlic clove, crushed 

Salt 

Currant jelly 



Have saddle nicely trimmed, but leave on the tail (although 
it will be blackened to a crisp, its flavor must not be lost). Boil 
all ingredients together 10 minutes, except meat, salt, and jelly. 
Lay saddle in a deep bowl and pour the boiling mixture over. 
Let stand 4-5 days, turning occasionally. Take saddle out of the 
marinade, and dry thoroughly; rub with salt; wrap in plenty of 
oiled paper, or slip into an oiled thick paper bag. Cook on a spit 
before an open fire, or under a slow gas grill with door open. 
When paper is much scorched remove it, saving every drop of 
dripping. Finish grilling and take up. Meanwhile have mari- 
nade strained and the amount of it desired for the sauce reduced 
one-half or more; mix with drippings and currant jelly to taste 
and serve in a boat. 

This is truly a man's dish and a dish for a man cook, since 
any housewife would object to the blackened color of the meat 
as it comes from the grill. But underneath the outer crust the 
flavor is superb, and will delight any gourmet. 

FILLET OF VENISON 

(Filete de Veado) 

1 small onion, chopped % cup olive oil

1 young turnip, chopped 2 cloves 



PORTUGUESE 251

4 peppercorns Vi cup currants 

1 fillet of venison 12 almonds, blanched and 

Bacon strips for larding shredded 

1 orange 2 tablespoons pomegranate pips 

1 lemon Salt 

1 cup white wine Cayenne 

Mix onion, carrot, turnip, oil, vinegar, cloves, mace and 
peppercorns. Place fillet in deep dish and pour mixture over. 
Marinate 4 hours, turning several times. Drain, wipe dry, and 
lard with bacon. Lay in roasting pan; strain marinade over and 
bake, basting frequently after first 10 minutes. Peel orange and 
lemon, cut peel in shreds and boil in water until tender. Drain 
and discard liquid. Reduce wine to J^ cup by boiling. Mix 
with orange and lemon juice. Take up fillet when done, and 
mix pan contents with wine mixture, adding a little boiling water 
if necessary. Thicken slightly with flour. Add currants, al- 
monds, orange and lemon peel, and heat until currants plump. 
Add pomegranate pips, season with salt and cayenne, and serve 
sauce in a boat. 

While we think of venison chiefly in terms of the gigantic 
spreading-antlered species of our north woods, Europeans are 
accustomed to much smaller species, semi-domesticated in game 
preserves. In wooded sections of Portugal, Spain, Austria, Ger- 
many and anywhere in the Alps deer are so common and tame 
that they may be counted by the dozen out of train windows. 
Some of them are so small you could slip a doe in your overcoat 
pocket and use the tiny buck's horns for chop-sticks.

Stoned olives 

Cut venison and ham in shreds the size of a lead pencil. 
Place in a bowl with bacon, wine, bay leaf, garlic, pepper, nut- 
meg, parsley, thyme, lemon juice, and vinegar. Mix well and 
marinate 2 days, stirring occasionally. Sift flour with 1 teaspoon 
salt, work in the butter, add 5 egg yolks, slightly beaten, and 
knead together to form a stiff dough. If not moist enough add a 
little cold water. Cover with a cloth and allow to stand J4 hour. 
Then break off bits of the dough and with the hands mold out 
shells to fit patty pans. Roll out some of the dough and cut 
covers to fit the shells. Cut venison and ham in inch lengths. 
Set the shells in the pans, and fill with the meat, adding a little 
minced parsley, chopped egg, the minced bacon from the mari- 
nade, and 1 olive in each shell. Moisten with some of the 
marinade mixture. Brush edge of dough with egg yolk, put on 
cover and press down. With a sharp knife make a gash in the 
center to let out the steam, and bake in a moderate oven 
(350°F.). The pies are nearly done when the gravy begins to 
rise through the hole in the cover. Remove from oven, brush 
tops with egg yolk, and put back in oven for a moment to dry 
the egg. Take pies out of the tins at once, and serve either hot

add slowly to the paste. Add currants, raisins and wine and mix 
thoroughly. Put into a buttered and floured pudding mold and 
bake 1 hour in a moderate oven (350°F.). Or mold may be 
placed in a kettle of boiling water, covered closely and boiled 2 
hours. Serve with lemon, fruit or hard sauce.

Portuguese desserts are seldom the feature of the meal, be- 
cause sweets are not craved after copious wining and dining; so 
a plain pudding or caramel custard is the standard sobremesa; or 
fruits and cheese. 

MAIDEN'S KISSES 
(Beijinhos de Moca) 

iYi cups granulated sugar 3 egg yolks, well beaten 

% cup water 1 cup grated cheese 

Yi cocoanut freshly grated Flour 

Cook sugar with water until it forms a firm ball in cold 
water. Remove from fire, add coconut and cool. Mix in beaten 
yolks, return to fire and stir until mixture begins to boil. Turn 
into a bowl and leave until following day. Mix in grated cheese 
and sufficient flour to make a paste. Put in buttered patty pans 
or small forms and bake in moderately hot oven (375° F.). 

TINDER-BOXES 
(Petiscos) 

1 cup grated hard cheese Yi cup granulated sugar 

1 tablespoon butter 12 egg yolks 

Yi cup flour Juice of 1 lemon 

Mix all ingredients thoroughly together. When they are well 
blended put in small oblong forms, the size and shape of tinder- 
boxes, from which this old reliable recipe gets its name. Bake 
about 10 minutes in hot oven (400° F.). 

DREAMS 

(Sonhos) 

1 cup hot milk 1 cup flour 

Few grains salt 4 eggs 

1 tablespoon granulated sugar Powdered sugar 
Cinnamon 



PORTUGUESE 265 

Bring milk, salt and sugar to a boil. Drop in flour all at 
once and stir vigorously until dough is a smooth ball in pan. 
Remove from fire and add eggs 1 at a time, beating thoroughly 
after each addition. Drop mixture by dessertspoonfuls into deep 
hot fat, a few at a time. Take out when a rich brown, drain and 
sprinkle with powdered sugar and cinnamon. These puffs are 
served with coffee. 

HEAVENLY "BACON" 
(Toucinho do Ceo) 

11 egg yolks 2 tablespoons caramel 

3 cups granulated sugar 1 inch stick cinnamon 

2 cups water 2 or 3 strips lemon rind 

Beat egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored. Grease a pud- 
ding dish with sweet butter and pour in mixture. Place in 
steamer over hot water and cook gently until eggs are jelly-like, 
but firm. Remove, let cool, then cut in slices. Mix sugar, water, 
and caramel in saucepan, add cinnamon and lemon rind. Place 
over fire and boil 5 minutes. Put in egg slices, let simmer until 
slices are well soaked, then remove, and arrange them on a dessert 
plate. Remove cinnamon and lemon and pour syrup over. Serve 
cold. 

The pet name of this popular sweet, "Toucinho do Ceo," 
translates literally "Bacon of Heaven," and heavenly bacon means 
much to a Portuguese, for it is his favorite seasoning and goes 
into all stews. Bacon to him symbolizes good living, the fat of 
the land. The Spaniards dote on this cured pig-meat, too, but, 
alas, it is likely to be rancid.

"Monks' Hoods," "Heavenly Bacon" and "Nun's Sighs" show 
the playful attitude of the Portuguese toward his religion. Monks 
and nuns, in spite of their supposed abstemiousness, are often 
great gluttons. The church, indeed, has fostered both fine food 
and drink through the heavy indulgence in it by its earthly vicars, 
among whom we find as many gourmands as we do in royal 
families — for it takes both wealth and leisure to indulge one's 
whims of appetite.

L'ART DU BIEN MANGER 

{The Art of Eating Well) 



It is not by accident that France is the world center of fine 
food and drink, but largely because of her geographical location 
and direct inheritance of dishes and drinks from Roman occupa- 
tion, Spanish conquest and the influence of sea-faring Portuguese 
along her coast. Not only these, but also Greek and Arabic con- 
tributions in the Midi, Basque sturdiness of Pyreneese dishes 
flaming with applejack, Flemish fashions from Flanders and the 
downright German cuisine of Alsace-Lorraine, where Teutonic 
beer and Latin wine flow together. Besides, Napoleonic conquest 
brought in foreign food fashions and filled Paris with Generals 
and diplomats who had plenty of gold to encourage the restaura- 
teurs. War as well made thrifty fare imperative for the op- 
pressed masses, so they were forced to making the best of giblets, 
dressing up lungs and tripe into toothsome delicacies, even as our 
poverty-stricken slave negroes turned chitterlings and possum 
into celestial dishes. Cheap cuts and round steaks of horse the 
Parisians turned into near-sirloins of beef, pig's ears they meta- 
morphosed into silken sausages. Alley cat they substituted for 
wild hare with great cleverness. 

By now, all of these foreign and making-the-best-of-it influ- 
ences have merged, in two universal centers of epicurianism, 
Paris and Lyons. Lyonnaise potatoes and Parisian bceuf a la 
mode, along with Julienne potatoes, soup Julienne and mayon- 
naise are as common international fare as chop suey or spa- 
ghetti. In the matter of potatoes alone, the whole world eats 

273 



274 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

them in French style, au gratin, a la Napoleon, en robe de 
chambre (in their dressing gowns) or plain French fried. 

Everybody eats table d'hote or a la carte and the menu 
everywhere is in French, of course, and about all the French that 
many of us know. In the esperanto of dining we have adopted 
the French name for every course, from hors d'ceuvres, through 
soup, salad, piece de resistance and sauce all the way to dessert 
and liqueurs. But though French table customs and words have 
run round the world, this universal usage of them is compara- 
tively recent in origin. For not more than a century and a half 
ago the taverns of London and ristorantes of Rome made meals 
more distinguished than any served up in similar caravansaries of 
Paris. The very beef, which as bceuf a la mode became the name 
of a pioneer Parisian restaurant in the Palais Royal, was adopted 
from old England, while the surpassing dishes au gratin which 
helped heavily in establishing the Parisian cuisine, were out and 
out Italian. 

The first great restaurant of Paris was established in the 
Palais Royal in 1786 and called "Les Trois Freres Provencaux," 
after the three rustic brothers of Provence who came to town to 
start it. Then Careme, the father of all chefs, came along and 
cooked ten years for Talleyrand, who was known as "the first 
fork of his time." It was either Careme or Talleyrand who set 
the international pace of cooking thus early by importing Par- 
mesan from Italy and sprinkling it in the soup, by fetching dry 
Madeira from its distant island and drinking it after the soup. 

Anthony Careme indeed set the royal style of "Bien Manger" 
which came to flower in Napoleon's Empire. Besides being chef 
to Talleyrand, Careme cooked for Emperor Alexander, Lord 
Stewart, the English Ambassador to Vienna, Baron Rothschild, 
inventing and dedicating dishes to these patrons, many of which 
became classics and are known down to this day. Careme put 
the art in artichokes, lifted the humble casserole from the kitchen 



FRENCH 275 

to the studio and guided "La Haute Cuisine" until Savann came 
along. Savarin was the fork who hoisted the hitherto muddy 
and dejected crayfish of his home creek at Belley in the Province 
of Bugey into a distinguished omelet. He dignified the whis- 
kered crawdad by calling him a fresh water lobster fit to mingle, 
in Newburg society. His book "Physiologie du Gout" definitely 
identified deglutition with the fine arts. The wisecracks of 
Savarin not only filled the mouths of the elegants of his day, but 
come down to us proverbially — Tell me what you eat, and I will 
tell you what you are — Cookery is an art, but to roast requires 
genius — To maintain that a man must not change his wine is 
a heresy: the palate becomes cloyed, and, after three or four 
glasses, it is but a deadened sensation that even the best wine 
provokes — a last course at dinner, wanting cheese, is like a pretty 
woman with only one eye. 

By the middle of the nineteenth century Paris was full of 
provincial kitchens, Flemish, Lyonnaise, Bordelaise, Provencal — 
white-hatted chefs from Normandy, Toulouse, Burgundy, Lor- 
raine, Languedoc, everywhere set up shop in the capital and 
served their specialties; truffled turkey and quails, matelote of eel 
(vulgarly called "the eel's hornpipe" from the frantic pan-dance 
the sea-serpent performs, shimmying and simmering in white 
wine and onions), confits de oie, pate de foie gras, cassoulets, 
casse crout, vins de paille, sauces Robert Bearnaise, and beurre 
noire, styles a la cocotte, a la jardiniere, Julienne, onion soup, 
sheep's trotters, tripe, Pharamond, creme de cassis, mousse au 
chocolat, marrons glace, souffles. Then Dumas the Elder put it 
all down in a thousand-page cook book, the last of his career. 
He was an amateur cook himself, but exotic, for he dressed his 
asparagus with lobster sauce. 

Queen Victoria hired herself a French chef, and a French 
chevalier made a fortune teaching the British how to mix salad. 
Edward Prince of Wales came along and dined more often in 



276 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Paris than in London. Instead of complimenting a chef on his 
sole, H.R.H. Ed said, "This Chateau d'Yquem is excellent," and 
that the chef averred was the highest compliment a diner could 
pay, for the dish that accompanies a wine must subtly bring 
out its full flavor. 

By the time Oscar Wilde arrived to end his life in Paris 
gorging on ortolans and writing about them, cookery had become 
so blame literary that a dish was dubbed "omelet homme de let- 
tres," Author's Omelet, and Georges Vicaire published his ency- 
clopediac "Bibliographic Gastronomique" to record the vast lit- 
erature on the subject. But don't imagine that any of this was 
over the heads of the people who by that time were calling each 
other affectionately by marrowy pet names like "my little cab- 
bage," men petit choux. All Paris went to Les Halles (the vast 
market) at dawn to select a live fish from the tanks, eat onion 
soup stringy with cheese, and discuss the sapid Fromage de Mon- 
sieur Fromage, a cheese actually made by Mr. Cheese himself and 
so named — which is reminiscent of the famous poulet of Mere 
Poularde (fat pullet). 

Then Picasso and Picabia came along with their modern art 
and cubist salads were concocted of triangles of tripe, cones of 
cucumber and geometrical lozenges of shrimp, just to get the 
artistic effect. Food went violently futurist for a while. Potage 
a la Paul Poiret. Choucrout Chirico. There were fantastic food 
fandangos, in which all seven of the arts were crammed into one 
dish, inventions as ridiculous as bananas baked with anchovies 
and served with a dash of absinthe. Paul Reboux published 
"Plats Nouveaux," suggesting heretical compositions of purple 
purees and mauve mangoes, so for a while cooking went dada. 

Then came the reaction of reason, and in 1923 the Salon 
d'Automne of Paris officially recognized Gastronomy as the Ninth 
Art (moving pictures being the eighth) and voted to squelch 
the radical left-wing tendency and stop for all time their wicked 



FRENCH 277 

experiments with mixing surrealist salads o£ dill pickles and ice 
cream. Since the first gastronomic exhibit of 1923 a section of 
the great seasonal art show is devoted to the classical cookery of 
the French provinces, and the patriot takes his regional potage or 
garbure even more seriously than before. And that always has 
been serious enough, as anybody knows who has watched a 
French family sit down to dinner, the head of the house solemnly 
ladling his portion out of the immense tureen, savoring its steam, 
sampling its quality as though it were a rare wine. For French 
soup is a rigid institution without which there is no dinner. In 
its way, the potage is as important here as port in England or 
dumplings in Bavaria. 

The Frenchman is informal enough at his plain morning 
cafe au lait with a brioche or croissant, newspaper and cigaret, 
but he approaches both lunch and dinner with sanctified serious- 
ness, a rubbing of hands and tummy, crackling and tucking in of 
napkins, anticipatory peeping under dish covers. At table noth- 
ing must interfere with his enjoyment, the slightest interruption 
is resented and no visitor would presume to butt in on this devout 
ritual. 

We must be meticulous then in approaching such a sanc- 
tified cuisine, which is not taken lightly by anybody from the 
most modest midinette who munches pomme frittes out of the 
common frying pans around the ramparts, right up to those mas- 
ter cooks who have won their cordon bleu. In an article of this 
scope we cannot attempt to give the full cuisine, province by 
province, and yet we must not overlook the great classic regional 
dishes that have been celebrated for a century and a half by such 
experts as Careme, Savarin, Beauvilliers, Ude, Francatelli, Ur- 
bain-Dubois, GoufT e and Dumas, and could be had at the Cafe de 
Paris, Fouchon's, La Perouse, Tour de Argent, Marguery's, Pru- 
nier's, or at the old Au Pieds de Mouton, down by the market. 

Our best guides to regional cooking are the gastronomic 



278 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

maps hung on walls, displayed in art galleries and preserved in 
books. These give pictures of the actual foodstuffs and bottles 
that distinguish each of the provinces, which number about the 
forty-eight of our own States. From these charts we learn to dis- 
tinguish the three divisions of cooking, royal, bourgeois and 
peasant, exorbitant, medium-priced and cheap; or still in other 
words, classical, family and plain folk-cooking. This last division 
consists of "les plats regionaux," and since the two higher classes 
spring from these local dishes, they are the most basically French. 

In poring over the food maps we see that the province of 
Burgundy is perhaps most representative of the whole country, 
for here both food and wine are combined in a marvelous menu, 
the bottle being used as lavishly in cooking as in Spain itself. 
The rival Bordelais district produces as great wine, of course, and 
its sauce Bordelaise (shallots cooked in claret with butter, nut- 
meg, pepper and parsley) is more widely known than sauce 
Bourguignonne, but Burgundy has two sauces to Bordelaise's 
one, the second being sauce Dijonnaise (mustard of Dijon 
whipped up with egg yolk and butter). 

A selection of Burgundian dishes with their accompanying 
Burgundy wines will suggest the rich possibilities of but one 
province :

Dishes 

Burgundy Snails 
(for lunch) 

Fat and juicy, first boiled in white wine 
with an herb bouquet, then filled with but- 
ter made tasty by chopped parsley, shallots 
and garlic. Then grilled and served tongue- 
hot. A silver snail-holder and a tiny fork 
with two tines comes handy in eating them. 

Fish 

The Pike of Dijon 
(for dinner) 

Pike fillets, larded and marinated in Bur- 
gundy brandy (Marc) and white wine, 
baked with mushrooms and smothered in 
cream sauce. 

Suckling Pig 
(for lunch) 

Stuffed with garlic, sage, parsley and its 
own giblets. Baked and dashed with white 
wine just before serving. 

Burgundy Cock 
(for dinner) 

Sauteed with onions and bacon, brandy 
burned over it, then stewed with mush- 
rooms in Chambertin wine and herbs. 
Each piece served up on a square of fried 
toast.

consider vegetables as a mere adjunct to meat, although Italy en- 
riches her green stuffs with cheese, Spain with an cgg y and thus 
delicious vegetable entrees are compounded. And having men- 
tioned entrees, it is amusing to note that the French definition of 
this elastic course is — the dish that immediately follows the soup. 
So there can be no entrees at lunch, since there is no soup, and 
that should simplify things. 

In a cuisine as vinous as that of Burgundy quite naturally 
there is little appetite for sweets after a meal; and since the Bur- 
gundians have no local cheese of distinction, they use the Gruyere 
of neighboring Franche-Comte, which of course is nothing but 
Swiss cheese made in France, for here the two countries are sep- 
arated only by a hair in the soup-and-food map. The Burgun- 
dians make this fine cheese into La Gougere, a savoury not un- 
like Welsh rarebit. 

Besides strong brandies distilled from their heavy wines, the 
Burgundians make two liqueurs, creme de cassis and kirsch, the 
German schnapps, for Burgundy has been influenced by Ger- 
man rule, somewhat the same as her sister provinces of Alsace 
and Lorraine. In fact, this whole northern section shows the 
teutonic influence and the cooking of Strasbourg, the same as 
its language is overwhelmingly teutonic. Besides schnapps, Bur- 
gundy is praiseworthy for this black currant creme de cassis, 
which is used chiefly to sweeten aperitifs rather than drunk after 
dinner. 

Burgundy wines, of course, have no end. They are served 
in good-sized globes, never half filled. The red ones are caressed 
and warmed in the hand and their fragrance frequently enjoyed 
by the nose, for which ample room is provided by the wide rim. 

Besides the wines mentioned in the selection of dishes above, 
there are Richebourg and Bonnes Mares of the Cote de Nuits 
reds and the heady Cortons of the Cote de Beaune. The best re- 



FRENCH 281 



cent vintages are 1915, '16, '19, '20, '21, '23, '26, '28 and '29, Chablis 
alone having been exceptionally good in 1922. 

Sparkling Burgundy, of course, never appears on a Burgun- 
dian table. It is an unnatural product manufactured out of most 
any old thing for export to America. So if you must drink im- 
ported bubbly water, stick to champagne. 

The classic French cuisine is nearly as familiar to us as the 
cooking of our own Colonial mothers. We eat our canapes, our 
dishes of this and that, en casserole, en brochette, en papillote, and 
au gratin, have our meats and vegetables dressed with sauces 
mayonnaise, beurre noir, maitre d'hotel, Bernaise, Bercy, poulette, 
and vinaigrette, after our consomme, bouillon, puree, or bisque; 
we prepare dishes saute, frappe, and fricassee and finish our din- 
ners with parfaits, coupes, glaces, and mousses. The names of 
the mistresses of French kings are chiefly familiar to us through 
dishes named for "la Pompadour," "la Maintenon," and for that 
first winner of the "cordon bleu" — "la Du Barry." 

But the recipes are usually the highly conventionalized ver- 
sions carried around the world by that curious Parisian export 
product, the French chef, and, more often than not, they have 
come to us through restaurant and hotel kitchens known as 
"French." Alas, one finds them from Tokio, to London, to New 
York, to San Francisco, and back to Tokio again. The name 
and the semblance are there, but the spirit is sadly lacking; and 
this explains why the travelling gourmet avoids the hotel with 
the menu written in French, and takes up his abode, by prefer- 
ence, in one served by a good native cook, even at the sacrifice 
of walking down long corridors to the bath. 

Much of this same stylish but dispirited cooking can be found 
within the ramparts of the sacred city itself, although, of course, 
eating can also be done magnificently in Paris. The French, 
themselves, complain, especially if they hail from any of the 
gourmandizing provinces. Could they but enjoy a so-called 



282 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

morue a la creme, as originally made by its inventor, Bechamel; 
or the supper Mme. Du Barry offered to Louis XV, brought up 
through the floor on a table volante, or filets de volaille a la Belle- 
vue as concocted by Pompadour for Louis XVI; or the sauce 
Vatel made just before he committed suicide because the sea fish 
to go with it did not arrive in time, at Chantilly, for the fete din- 
ner of his master, Conde, author of 'TEscuyer Tranchant" (The 
Art of Carving) ! 

The Frenchman, sojourning in his capital, seeks out a re- 
gional eating place, uncorrupted by foreign influences, except 
when he goes, en fete, to one of the great restaurants. By the 
same wisdom this chapter is made up largely of regional cooking, 
with a minimum of internationally known dishes. 

Care has been taken to give the recipes as they are used in 
the districts themselves. One may eat a delicious bceuf en daube 
a la Provencal in Brittany, or a wonderful bouillabaisse in Paris, 
but of course the beef dish is at its best in the land of its origin, 
Provence, and nowhere else does the bouillabaisse reach the per- 
fection it attains in its home town of Marseilles. Just as pepper 
pot should be eaten in Philadelphia, although it may be ordered 
in San Francisco where the very air will likely detract from its 
excellence; and Boston baked beans and brown bread in New 
Orleans would never be anything for the visiting foreigner to 
write home about. 

Note: Throughout this French section the names of provinces 
where the recipes originated are given in italics at the top of 
each recipe. 



APPETIZERS 

(Hors d'CEuvres) 



Provence ANCHOADE 

8 anchovies Olive oil 

1-3 garlic cloves, sliced Wine vinegar 

Pepper 1 loaf stale bread 

Soak anchovies a few minutes in cold water, clean, and re- 
move fillets. Put them in a bowl or mortar and mash with the 
garlic. Add an inch-cube of the bread, crumbled, and mash all 
together, add pepper and a little oil and work into a smooth paste. 
Season to taste with a few drops of vinegar. Cut bread in small 
squares, spread with the paste, and put under the grill. 

This anchoade is known as Lou Pan bagna, when the bread 
is first "bathed" in olive oil. 

In Provence, when the characteristic aroma of anchoade 
floats out from the kitchen, the neighbors remark that some 
gastronome or other is surely going to enjoy his lunch. An- 
choade, like its first cousins, the Neapolitan pissaladeira and 
le pain dausse (see recipes), is eaten either as an appetizer or a 
whole meal, and of course accompanied by zestful dry wine. 
These, because of their antiquity and continued popularity, would 
seem to be the original canapes, first enjoyed by gastronomes 
while the barbarous tribes of northern Europe were still snatch- 
ing their half -raw food out of the ashes of camp-fires. 

The Scandinavians and Russians seized upon this canape, 
adding to it their own tongue-teasing smoked and pickled fish,

284 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

milt, roe and caviar, then handed it back to the French who 
standardized it among the hors d'ceuvres. But finally it came to 
perfection in these United States, when the need was felt for 
some provocative tidbit to accompany our invention, the cock- 
tail. Today, indeed, the best canapes in Paris are to be found in 
Russian and Scandinavian restaurants and bars catering to the 
American taste and purse. 

As with entrees, the originality of the chef is displayed in 
concocting hors d'ceuvres, and in the swanky restaurants of Paris, 
Lyons or Nice sometimes thirty or forty appetite-openers are 
passed in separate dishes, and no two of them alike. They range 
from chitterlings and anchovies to tiny portions of melon and 
salted tarts of chicken blood. The best butters of each Province 
are served as hors d'ceuvres, often in a garnished block weighing 
from ten to fifty pounds. Other standbys are mussels, sardines, 
anchovies, oursins, cockles, pickled cock's combs, roe, tunny, 
olives all colors, radishes, salads of everything, hard-boiled eggs, 
sausages all sorts, hams cooked and raw, pickled mushrooms, 
peppers, artichokes, smoked meats, blood puddings, brains, sweet- 
breads, cucumbers, shrimps, galantines, oysters, tongue, onions, 
panisses, little pates of liver and almost anything else, the raw 
sausage of Aries, pain Dausse, rillettes and rillons of pork, onions, 
game patties, fried in pig's blood, tapenade, terrines, prunes in 
vinegar, saveloys, celery and celeriac, in fact, anything and every- 
thing tasty, but chiefly local salads, sausages, pickles and garnish- 
ings, in fact, a ten-course dinner in miniature, generously descrip- 
tive of the great dishes to follow it.

meal of the peasant, himself as open-faced as the farm-bread 
sandwich of his invention. Or it makes a stimulating appetizer 
to a Picardian feast of tripe soup, leek pie, stuffed boned duck of 
Amiens, all washed down with copious draughts of the cider 
of Thierache. 

Provence N£W YEAR ,g £VE TIDBITS 

(Bonne-Bouche d'une Bonne Annee) 

Line boat-shaped patty tins with puff paste, rolled thin, let- 
ting paste hang over one side for a cover. Lay in each a filleted 
anchovy and fold paste over it. Bake in medium hot oven and 
serve hot. If tins of the required shape are not at hand, the paste- 
enveloped anchovies can be neatly formed with the hands and 
laid on a buttered baking sheet. 

This is a traditional accompaniment of midnight refresh- 
ments on New Year's Eve in Provence. 



SOUPS 

(Soupes) 



There is such a sea of soups in France that ten classifications 
are needed to distinguish them. These are as follows, in the 
order of the number of soups belonging to each type: soupe, 
potage, potee, puree, garbure, bisque, bouillon, bouillie, con- 
somme and pot-au-feu. 

A dozen individual soups besides have earned distinguished 
names of their very own and do not belong to any of the above 
groups: bouillabaisse, une chiffonnade, une Bretonne, une 
Julienne, croute-au-pot, la bouillade, l'ouillade, le tourain Borde- 
lais, etc. Croute-au-pot is the standard crust soup, bouillabaisse 
the celebrated fish chowder, of which la bouillade is a regional 
variant. The Bretonne is bean soup and Julienne and chifTonade 
are as like as two pea-soups, both swimming with shredded vege- 
tables, but the Julienne a thick puree and the chiffonade a thin 
broth. 

Of the ordinary soups, one is named after nearly every 
Province, those of Gascony, Limousine, Nivernaise, Normandy 
and Auvergne being of outstanding excellence. Others in this 
classification are called after their chief ingredients, garlic, rice, 
mutton, giblets, bacon, tripe, eels, birds, beer, wine, game, shad, 
pumpkin, pig's head, corn, water-cress, hops, frogs, ravens, crabs, 
cherries, mushrooms, chestnuts, onions, pears, peas, mussels, and 
so on, without end. 

Likewise the potages are named in honor of their regions of 
origin, potage a la Picarde (leeks and potatoes), le potage Alsa- 

286 



FRENCH 287 

cien (eggs, flour and broth), potage Dauphinoise (vegetable 
puree with calf's hocks, whipped cream and toast). Others are 
made with chicken, fish-dumplings, lentils, cabbage-dumplings 
and carrots. Their names alone would fill a chef's handbook: 
potage en tortue (mock turtle soup), potage a la Soubise (onion 
soup), a la reine (chicken), a la printaniere (spring greens), 
a la Parmentier (potatoes), a la Francaise, a la bataille, a la 
creme d'orge, etc. Potage a la Cambaceres is rather special, be- 
ing a pheasant soup named after the Duke of Parma, who always 
drank a bottle of champagne with it. Potage a la parisienne is 
similar to this, though made of turkey, and the champagne put 
right into the tureen. 

But of them all, the most elaborate is potage a la patrie. 
This patriotic soup contains a little of everything and would be 
difficult to prepare outside the well-stocked markets of Paris. 1 
hen, 2 pigeons, an ox-palate, 2 sweetbreads, liver dumplings, hops 
in bud, viper's grass or borage, asparagus, green peas, baby car- 
rots, sponge dumplings, seeded dumplings, cauliflower, butter 
and crawfish tails. 

Ile-de-France QNION soup 

(Soupe a I'Oignon) 

*4 cup butter Salt and pepper 

4 onions, sliced thin French bread 

1 quart meat broth or stock 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 

Melt butter in pan and add onions; simmer slowly until 
golden. Add broth, season and simmer. Slice the small end 
of a French loaf very thin; dry slices crisp in the oven. (The 
French use an attenuated thin crusty loaf called a flute.) Pour 
soup into a casserole, float bread on top so as to nearly cover. 
Sprinkle cheese over bread; set in oven and brown. Bring cas- 
serole at once to the table, and serve in hot soup plates.

THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 



Americans once resident in France are ever afterward at- 
tacked by a returning longing for this peasant soup, which is 
always served with ceremony in the finest restaurants. It is a 
specialty of the market eating places around Les Halles in Paris, 
where vendors of carrots and cabbages rub elbows in the early 
dawn with jewelled and opera-cloaked all-night revellers, over 
hearty helpings of a dish which is equally good for putting one 
to bed happy, or fortifying for a day of hard labor.

1 tablespoon olive oil l / 2 bay leaf 

1 tomato, chopped Salt and pepper 

1% quarts water 1 teaspoon saffron 

1 dozen crabs *4 pound vermicelli 

Fry leek and garlic in oil without browning. Add tomato

and remove meats; discard intestines. Pound the rest and put 
back in soup; boil up for 5 minutes, stir well, strain and press 
through a sieve. Heat liquid again to boiling, add meat from 
claws, saffron, and vermicelli. Boil 8 minutes. 

This is really a bisque, or soup in which the meat ingredient 
is pressed through a sieve and becomes one of the thickening 
elements. Often bisques are made with one of the thick sauces, 
Bechamel or veloute; or the base is bound with flour and milk

THICK SOUP OF CRECY CARROTS 
{Puree Crecy) 

White Stoc\ Puree 

6 slices bacon 4 carrots, chopped 

1 onion, chopped 1 onion, chopped 

1 knuckle veal, broken *4 cup uncooked rice 

2 sprigs celery leaves 1V2 quarts white stock 
2 sprigs parsley Salt 

1 leek 1 tablespoon butter 

1 sprig thyme Croutons 

2 cloves 

6 peppercorns 

Lay bacon in frying pan over low flame; as soon as fat runs 
add onion; slowly fry to light golden color. Place in deep pot; 
add all other stock ingredients; cover with i 1 /* quarts cold 
water, bring slowly to a boil, and simmer 3-4 hours, removing 
all skum that rises. Remove bones. Strain through cloth. This 
stock is greatly improved if poultry trimmings, or the carcass 
of a chicken is included. To make puree Crecy, select carrots 
of a deep orange color; chop, and add, with onion and rice, to 
1 J/2 quarts white stock; simmer 40 minutes. Season, press 
through a fine sieve, put back on fire, add butter, and simmer 
until well blended. Serve poured over small croutons. 

This is a popular Parisian soup originating in the Crecy 
district, just outside of Paris and well-known for its vegetable 
gardens. The carrots of Crecy are especially esteemed in the 
capital city, which is so devoted to carrots that it can distinguish 
a Crecy carrot from any other with its eyes shut.

Brittany BRITTANY CRUST SOUP 

(Croute Bretonne) 

2 pounds shin of beef i herb bouquet 

3 pounds beef bones Salt and pepper 

i carrot l / & teaspoon nutmeg 

i young turnip 6 tablespoons grated Parmesan 

i parsnip cheese 

i onion Rounds toasted bread 

Cover beef, bones, vegetables, and bouquet with 2 quarts 
cold water, bring slowly to boil, add i teaspoon salt and skim. 
Simmer 3 hours, adding salt and pepper the last hour. Strain 
and reheat. Mince vegetables fine, mix with nutmeg and cheese, 
and arrange on the rounds of toast; lay in buttered baking pan 
and brown in the oven. Serve on a hot platter to be eaten while 
partaking of the hot broth. If Parmesan is not at hand use hard, 
dry cheese, since soft "store" cheese would ruin such a fine soup. 
Parmesan, it will be remembered, is Italy's great gift, not only 
to French cooking, but to that of the whole world. 

The French cook, as well as the Spanish, has a way with 
the "bouilli," or beef left from soup or "pot-au-feu," and dresses 
it in tasty ways which make up for its loss of flavor. The meat 
left from this soup turns up on the family table next day "au 
gratin," "sur le gril," or "frites" (see recipes). 

CRAYFISH BISQUE 

(Bisque aux Ecrevisses) 

3 tablespoons butter 2 cloves 

2 onions, minced 1 bay leaf 

1 leek, minced 2 dozen crayfish 

1 carrot, minced 1 pint white wine 

1 bit celery root, minced 4 parsley sprigs 

2 quarts veal or chicken broth 3 tablespoons dried bread crumbs 

2 egg yolks, beaten 



FRENCH 293 

Heat butter and slowly fry onions, leek, carrot and celery 
root 10 minutes, cool slightly and add broth. Boil 20 minutes; 
add cloves and bay leaf, and reduce heat. Meanwhile drop cray- 
fish in boiling water mixed with wine, add parsley and cook 
15 minutes. Drain, saving liquid; crack shells, remove meat 
from shells and claws, discarding intestines. Save out a few 
of the largest bits of the tails. Grind all other portions of meat, 
including the shells, fine, with the crumbs, and add to boiling 
broth. Boil 35 minutes. Strain and press through a sieve. 
Quickly reduce liquid in which crayfish were cooked and add. 
Add tails; season; remove from fire, let stand a moment, and 
add egg yolks, being careful that boiling has ceased, so yolks 
will not curdle. 

LOBSTER BISQUE 
(Bisque aux Homard) 

Follow recipe for Bisque aux Ecrevisses, substituting a small 
lobster for the crayfish. 

SHRIMP BISQUE 
{Bisque aux Crevettes) 

Follow recipe for Bisque aux Ecrevisses, substituting an equal 
quantity of shrimps; shells and heads of shrimps being ground 
the same as the crayfish. 

BISQUE OF POULTRY OR BIRDS 

{Bisque aux Volaille) 

Follow recipe for Bisque aux Ecrevisses, substituting flesh of 
poultry or birds. There will be nothing to take the place of 
shells for color and flavor, so a larger bulk of meat must be used. 



294 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Provence BOUILLABAISSE 

Bouillabaisse is but an aigo-sau (see recipe) enriched with 
a small lobster, crayfish or crabs, and perhaps an eel, and a cup 
o£ white wine added to the boiling liquid. It is colored with 
saffron to taste. 

The dish should be made for 8 persons, or more, since the 
greater the variety of hard- and soft-fleshed fish, the better the 
flavor. 

Bouillabaisse (or boui-abaisso, in the Provencal dialect) 
means to "boil up and stop," and the secret of the preparation 
lies in a hot fire and rapid cooking. The water, mixed with 
wine, must be boiling fast; the hard fish — lobster, crabs, eel, ray, 
and such gamey fish as bass, sea trout, and salmon — must be 
thrown in first and rapidly boiled for 5 minutes. Then the 
tender fish — such as cod, rock fish, snappers, etc. — are added and 
cooked but another 5 minutes. This leaves all fish slices shapely. 
Boiling ceases and the pot is kept hot while lobster is taken out, 
the meat extracted, and claws cracked, meat being returned to 
pot. The cracked claws are used to garnish the platter of fish, 
along with the whole crabs. 

Fish and broth are both served like aigo-sau.

1 pound marrow bone 4 onions, sliced 

2 tablespoons salt 2 celery stalks, sliced 
1 tablespoon peppercorns Herb bouquet 

1 egg white and shell 

Cut beef and veal in cubes. Brown beef with butter in a 
hot kettle. Cool, add 3 quarts of cold water, the marrow-bone 



FRENCH

and veal. Heat slowly to the boiling point, then simmer for 
5 hours, replenishing with boiling water. 6 quarts should be 
used, in all. Remove scum from the broth as it gathers at the 
sides. After cooking for 3 hours, add salt, peppercorns, carrots, 
turnip, cloves, onions, celery and bouquet. Continue simmer- 
ing for 3 hours, then strain through cloth. When cool remove 
fat. Add egg white and shell, bring to boiling point slowly, 
then strain again. 

Serve hot as a clear soup; or chilled and jellied (no gelatine 
necessary) ; or use as a basis for any of the following special con- 
sommes such as: consomme a l'Andalouse, a la Bagration, a la 
Beauvilliers, a la Barigoule, a la Bouerdaloue, a la Careme, a la 
chatelaine, a la Colbert, a la duchesse, a l'epicure, a la Monte 
Carlo, a la royal, a la St. Xavier; or consomme Andalousienne, 
Julienne, au quenelles, and de volaille, a whole index of con- 
sommes, down through the alphabet, comprising nearly a hun- 
dred in all. For consomme is one of the devices of the conven- 
tionalized French cuisine, and the standby of the restaurant chef, 
who adds a little of this vegetable or that garnishing to satisfy 
the requirements of a long list of soups served "a la carte." One 
of them tastes not unlike another. 

Of these, consomme chevalier and consomme Talleyrand are 
typical and illustrate the method of all special consommes. 

CONSOMME CHEVALIER 

Add to boiling consomme small chicken dumplings; and 
chicken breast and smoked beef tongue, cut julienne. 

CONSOMME TALLEYRAND 

Put 4 grated truffles in soup tureen; add ^2 cup very dry 
sherry, and 1 pinch cayenne. Cover and let stand 1 hour. Then 
pour over 3 pints hot consomme, in which has been boiled 2 
tablespoons tapioca.

Place a layer of cabbage on top, then strips of salt pork and 
drained vegetables until all are used. Discard herb bouquet. 
Pour broth over top, sprinkle with cheese and brown lightly in

with the salt pork. Confite d'oie should be added only when 
garbure is being arranged in casserole.

ents. Serve very hot. The mussels may be omitted in which 
case double the number of oysters. 

This dish, in spite of its seeming complications, is quickly 
prepared. It is a variation of the matelote, and is served Norman 
style wherever fresh seafood is obtainable in France, but with 
the Normandy cider giving way to white wine in the wine dis- 
tricts, and garnishings varying according to resources of local 
markets. The Normandy "matelote" is a simplified stew con- 
sisting of flat fish (brill or turbot) cooked in cider with mussels, 
onion, and herbs, and served in its own gravy, garnished with 
shrimps (see recipe).

This dish, being "sailor style" is subject to variations, addi- 
tional ingredients being oysters, fried smelts, and mushrooms, 
and beaten tgg yolk is used at the end for thickening instead of 
flour. Along the northern coast of France bream or turbot, 
both being flat fish, are preferred for a matelote, although other 
fish serve, and sometimes a mixture of several varieties, sliced 
or cut up. Then the fish is piled in the center of a deep platter 
and sent to the table swimming in some of its sauce, with heaps 
of the sea foods arranged around it. Cider is the Norman touch,

Season fish with salt and pepper, pour on oil, mix well and 
let stand 15 minutes. Mix with all other ingredients except 
bread. Cover with boiling water and cook quickly, keeping fish 
as whole as possible. Arrange bread in bottom of a dish and 
pour in broth. Put solid portions of fish and potatoes on next. 
Discard bay leaf and herb sprigs. Make Rouille sauce — grind 
garlic, pimento and bread and blend in olive oil; add cup of 
the fish broth. Serve in a sauce boat, to be sprinkled over fish 
and potatoes. 

Aigo-Sau, like its first cousin, the Bouillabaisse, is subject to 
infinite variations, saffron as well as tomato often lending it 
color. The sauce, undoubtedly at one time imported from Spain, 
is reminiscent of the gaspacho of Andalusia. It is energique au 
parfum and may be an accompaniment of nearly any of the 
Provencal dishes. 

Flanders FLEMISH MACKEREL 

(Maquereau a la Flamande) 

1 medium-sized mackerel 1 teaspoon minced parsley 

Salt and pepper Vi cup butter 

1 small onion, minced Juice 1 lemon 

4 shallots, minced 1 lemon, quartered 

Make sure the fish is very fresh, since mackerel deteriorates 
rapidly. Have fish cleaned, gills and tail removed; but leave on 
head, wrapping it with twine and securing it close to the body 
to retain stuffing. Salt and pepper it inside and out. Mix onion, 
shallots, and parsley in a mass with butter, and lay inside the 
fish. Sew up opening, or close with toothpicks or small skewers. 
Place fish in a dish, pour over it the lemon juice and let stand 
20 minutes, turning it over to flavor evenly. Drain and dry. 
Lay fish on an ample piece of well oiled paper; enfold, doubling 



FRENCH 303 

the edges of paper together two or three times. Turn in and 
double the ends over head and tail, to make a waterproof bag. 
Lay under a slow grill; the paper must not burn and release the 
juices. Grill on one side and then on the other. Lay all on a- 
hot platter, open paper, letting juices run over the fish while 
removing. Take of? twine and remove fastenings from the open- 
ing. Serve with lemon. The cooking time will vary from J^ 
to % of an hour, depending on size of fish.

The provinces of Flanders and Artois (with the English 
channel ports of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkerque) mark the 
extreme North by pushing right into Belgium. With these two 
foreign influences, British and Belgian, we find this border- 
cooking exhibiting tastes quite un-French. The herring salad 
above illustrates this well, with its liberal dose of mustard a F 
Angleterre and the sugar beets of Belgium. The gherkins also 
bring in the teutonic influence of Holland and Germany, which 
has made the neighboring territory of Alsace-Lorraine debated 
ground for so long. 

Beer takes the place of wine in the cooking of Flanders. 
Beer soup is just her dish, or eels simmered in the light Northern 
malt; Flemish red cabbage too, boiled in beer. Instead of cognac 
the drink is gin of Wambrechies, often mixed with coffee, and 
sometimes Montruil hard sparkling cider added to both. 

The mainstay of the whole section is hochepot, a hot pot 
into which everything goes, from sheep's trotters to pig's ears, 
cabbage and parsnips, of course, and never forgetting the leeks. 
Sauce Flamande is the standard dressing, made of cabbages, 
turnips, carrots, lettuce, sugar, salt and pepper boiled all together 
in meat broth. Garniture Flamande is small onions glazed, let- 
tuce braised, carrots saute and mashed potatoes. A curious cross- 
breed, again showing a cross of English with the French is 
"rosbif de mouton," as though there could be such a thing as 
roast beef of mutton. Beef is almost British in popularity here, 
although beef tongue is purely Latin, being cured with honey 
and herbs at Valenciennes. Other specialties are spiced Flemish 
goose, cookies flavored with aniseed (and here even an old

cheese sandwich, Maroille cheese on flat Flemish buns. 

Languedoc CO DFISH BRANDADE 

(Morue en Brandade) 

% pound salt cod Cream 

1 cup olive oil Juice 1 lemon 

1 shallot, minced Salt and pepper 

1 gadic clove, minced Nutmeg 

Rounds of bread 

Choose a cut from a fine, thick fish, not too dry. Soak fish 
24 hours in plenty of water, changing several times. Put in a 
saucepan with plenty of cold water, bring quickly to a boil, then 
simmer 15 minutes. Remove fish with a skimmer and drain. 
Remove bones, but leave skin, and cut in small pieces. Heat 1 
tablespoon olive oil, add shallot and garlic, and slowly fry with- 
out browning. Add fish and heat without frying. Grind as 
fine as possible, put in a warmed bowl and work with a wooden 
spoon, adding warmed oil, a drop at a time at first, and then 
little by little, until half the oil is absorbed and a smooth paste 
is formed. Then alternate additions of the rest of the oil with 
teaspoons of warmed cream. Blend in lemon juice and season- 
ings. Heat over hot water or steam. Have ready rounds of 
bread fried in oil or butter. Lay them on a very hot dish, and 
pile up the Brandade on top of them, like mashed potatoes. 

This is a dish of great delicacy, and is worthy of the garnish- 
ings which often adorn it. It may be sprinkled with chopped 
truffles, and may be surrounded by oyster, or shrimp, or crayfish 
patties. It reappears in Italy "bacala Montebianco."

Provence SARTAGNADE 

Yi pound white bait Salt and pepper 

3 tablespoons butter % tablespoon vinegar 

Wash fish well, pick over, drain, and dry thoroughly in a 
towel. Season. Melt butter in frying pan until nearly smoking. 
Add fish and fry, pushing them together at the side of the pan 
as they cook, so they will stick together but not stick to bottom 
of pan. When they hold together and are browned on the 
bottom lay a plate over them and turn pan upside down, leaving 
the fish in the plate. Slide fish off the plate into the pan again 
and brown other side. A thick pancake should have been formed 
which is crisp on the outside and succulent within. Heat vinegar 
and sprinkle over at the very last minute. 

A sartan in the Provencal dialect is a poele, or frying pan; 
and a sartagnade might be anything fried, but long usage has 
restricted the meaning of sartagnade to this one dish.

! /4 cup butter Salt and pepper 

Yi cup good applejack 1 tablespoon flour 

3 shallots, minced 1 cup cream 
Yi teaspoon chevril, minced 

(or parsley) 

Cut lobster in pieces, removing stony pouch and intestines. 
Crack claws. Heat 3 tablespoons butter and quickly brown 
lobster portions. Lay on a dish, pour brandy over and flare. Lay 
in a saucepan with herbs and seasonings, and the butter from 
frying. Add any liquid from lobster (and 2-3 tablespoons hot

water if liquid is insufficient). Cover closely and simmer, turn- 
ing the pieces from time to time until tender. Take up and 
keep hot. Add flour mixed with remaining melted butter, and 
then the cream. Boil 5 minutes, strain, and serve in a boat. 

Along the Brittany coast plain boiled lobster is the preferred 

dish. It is served with coarse salt, and the fine Brittany cider 

is drunk with it. 

SCALLOPS 

(Coquilles St. Jacques) 

Take the scallops out of the shell, roll them in bread crumbs, 
then put them back in cleaned shell with the liquor and a little 
garlic-butter (i.e. rub a bowl well with garlic; then place butter 
in bowl, cover, and let stand until flavored); add a small piece 
of bacon to each scallop, bake about 10 minutes and serve with 
mayonnaise. 

In the district of Boulogne-sur-Mer scallops are minced, 
mixed with minced mushrooms and simmered a moment in 
butter, seasoned, returned to the shell, garnished with crayfish 
tails, sprinkled with crumbs, melted butter and grated cheese, 
and browned in the oven; or, minced, mixed with minced oysters 
or mussels, and with minced mushrooms, parsley, and chives, 
heated in the liquid from the scallop shells or from the oysters, 
returned to the shells, sprinkled with crumbs and melted butter, 
and browned in the oven.

SCALLOPS IN THE STYLE OF NANTES 
(Coquilles Saint-Jacques a la Nantaise) 

12 large or 24 small scallops Salt and pepper 
1 onion, minced Muscadet (White wine of 

Yz garlic clove, minced Brittany) 

1 teaspoon minced parsley Bread crumbs 

Butter, melted 



FRENCH 309 

If scallops have been purchased in their shells, wash well, 
and lay at door of open hot oven until they open. Remove at 
once and take out meats (i.e., the white muscle, discarding in- 
testines, etc.) . Clean six of the shells thoroughly. Mince scallops, 
mix with onion, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. Add sufficient 
wine to moisten. Arrange mixture in the six shells, sprinkle 
with crumbs, and then with butter, and brown in moderate oven 
(350°F.). If scallops have been bought in bulk, bake mixture 
in scallop dishes or in small scalloped egg dishes. In France 
scallops go by the name of Coquilles Saint-Jacques and are in- 
variably purchased in their shells, so one may be sure they are 
fresh, since they are still alive. The shells are prized and kept 
by the frugal cook for baking or serving other dainty sea-food 
dishes. 

Sea-faring Brittany sits back picturesquely from her bleak 
granite coast in orchards of apples and pears. So most of her 
cooking is done with cider and perry (pear juice). Muscadet, 
called for in the recipe above, is her one good wine, all others 
going by the name "savage" or "foolish" wines. This is a great 
sea-food coast, its dishes winking with winkles, oysters, scallops, 
cockles, crawfish, lobsters, crabs, mussels, eels, and sardines. The 
sardines shipped from Nantes are noted not only for the delicacy 
of the fat meat but for careful preparation before canning. The 
finest qualities are not only boned but skinned, although some 
sardine-sharks who relish the skin object to this. As with eaters 
of mouldy Camembert-rinds the devotees of sardines, skins and 
all, maintain that the sweetest and fattest part lies closest to the 
skin, so it should never be discarded. 

Because of the profusion of fruit-blossoms every Brittany 
farmer keeps a bee and regards this busy little worker with affec- 
tion, almost as though it were a member of the family, much 
as an Irishman is closely attached to his pig or a Bavarian to 



3 io THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

his cow, with which, indeed, both nationalities share their own 
houses. 

Burgundy SNAILS BURGUNDY STYLE 

(Escargots de Bourgogne) 

These are the snails imported into the United States and 
sold at luxury food shops. They have been kept several days 
on rock salt, stewed in aromatic white wine, and then stuffed 
with a butter paste flavored with shallots and chopped parsley. 
Sealed with this paste, they keep nicely, and are shipped all over 
France as well as to foreign countries. They are ready for the 
grill and all that is necessary is to place them under the flame, 
butter side up, and make thoroughly hot. Do not let them cook 
in their butter, or they will toughen. Each portion should be 
accompanied by a scissorlike clamp of silver with which to hold 
them while they are taken out with a snail pick. But they may 
be held with the corner of a napkin and extracted with a tooth- 
pick, if the special snail gear is not available. 

True lovers of snails, after eating the meat, sip the warm 
butter sauce from the shell, the same as oyster and clam eaters 
invariably drain the last drop of juice from the shell. 

SEA URCHINS 
{Our sins) 

These spiny sea pin-cushions go by various names, sea-eggs, 
sea-urchins and sea-chestnuts, along the many rocky coasts where 
they cling to the bottom until the fisherman comes along, balanc- 
ing himself in the stern of his rowboat while he pries them off 
with a long pole. They are prized for the spoonful or two of 
salubrious coral within their spiny shells which has a flavor a 
little like caviar and comes in many shades, from crimson 
through pinkish-red to a pale yellowish yolk, depending on its 



FRENCH 311 

sex and diet. There is considerable waste of entrails, which is 
cleverly flipped out with the fisherman's knife in cleaning them. 
The coral is then loosened from its shell moorings and either 
sucked like an egg or spooned out. Both cooked and raw, it 
is also spread on buttered toast. 

The oursin enters into Provencal cooking in a number of 
interesting recipes. A few tablespoons of the coral, milt or roe, 
mashed in cream, is the distinctive touch added to an oursinade, 
that glorified fish stew cooked in white wine, the gravy thickened 
with a half-dozen egg-yolks and the creamed oursins stirred in 
at the finish. Oursins color and flavor mayonnaise more deli- 
ciously than crayfish butter, for a fish salad. These sea-eggs are 
in fact the secret of the success of many marine salads all along 
the Mediterranean. 

In Nice the natives go out in the bay and spear a bushel of 
these bristling sea-hedgehogs, take the dripping basket to the 
nearest wine shop and throw an oursin party. Sitting at their 
ease in the shade of a sidewalk cafe they shuck and eat them 
without seasoning beyond their own sparkling sea water, which 
is drunk from the shell the same way that Frenchmen smack 
up the oyster liquor after swallowing the oyster itself. White 
wine mates perfectly with the tasty oursin tang and indeed is 
the most expensive part of this snack, since the sea-chestnuts 
themselves are of little more value than their brothers that grow 
on trees. A dozen of them yield no more meat than one fat 
oyster, so it takes patience to eat them. In Nice there are street 
stands where they are expertly opened by the vendor and the 
salty highly-fishy liquid and vivid star-shaped roe are consumed 
on the spot. Those who dote on them say that no other shell- 
fish carries so much of the concentrated tang of the sea.

3 i4 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

In Paris, where eggs Bercy are as common as bacon and 
eggs in Chicago, the sausage used is chipolata, which contains 
sufficient onion flavor within its own skin, so only the parsley 
is fried with the sausage. This chipolata is quite a renowned 
sausage, born centuries ago in Italy and named after cipolla, a 
sort of glorified chives, pronounced c/upolla and Frenchified to 
chipolata. Perdreaux a la chipolata is a game sausage, taking its 
name from partridge and it is used to further enrich game 
dishes.

1Y2 cups white wine Juice Yi lemon 

l /t cup butter, melted Salt and pepper 

Simmer shallots in wine. Add butter and mix thoroughly. 
Stir in parsley and lemon juice. Season to taste. 

This is Paris' very own sauce, taking its name from the local 
market of Bercy, lavishly stocked with food-stuffs. Almost every 
course has a dish celebrating the name: eggs Bercy, fish Bercy, 
entrecote Bercy, calf's liver Bercy; in fact, this shallot sauce is 
sluiced on many viands to make them distinctly Parisian. For 
Parisians set the French taste for onions, shallots, or delicate 
chives, against the more exciting garlic of Italy, Spain and 
Portugal.

Melt butter, add flour and stir smooth. Take from fire and 
stir in boiling-hot milk. Beat and stir until free from all lumps; 
cook 15-20 minutes in double boiler; cool. Beat egg whites very 
stiff; yolks very light. Beat the cooled white sauce, then whip 
it together with the yolks, adding seasonings. Gently fold and 
mix in the beaten whites. Have ready a thick buttered baking 
dish in the shape of a mixing bowl. Turn mixture into the 
dish — it should be half full. Set into moderate oven (350 F.) 
and bake 30-40 minutes, laying a paper across the top of the dish 
if it browns too fast. Rush it to the table; cut down in sections 
with a sharp knife dipped in melted butter and lay on the plates 
with a pie-server, taking great care not to injure the delicate 
texture or make the souffle fall while serving. This recipe makes 
a sufficient entree for 8 persons, or a luncheon dish for 6 if no 
meat is being served. 

Cheese Souffle is made by adding l / 4 pound grated cheese 
to yolk of egg mixture. 

In her "Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas," Gertrude Stein 
has Alice say several times, in discussing modern artists gone 
prosperous, "and then they moved from their old studio . . . 
and had a servant and the servant of course made a souffle."

Bugey and Franche-Comte 

THE FONDU 

The Fondu (mellowness) is made in France according to 
many recipes for mixing eggs and cheese with various seasonings. 
Savarin borrowed this delightful Swiss cheese savory from its 
native land about a century ago. 

Brillat-Savarin was born at Belley, in the Province of Bugey, 
influenced by the neighboring Province of Franche-Comte and 
by the Spanish who ruled much territory hereabouts. Italy and 
Switzerland also merged in these Alpine districts, so Savarin had 
a wealth of dishes to choose from, Spanish pigeon pies and 
watermelon pickles; Italian ravioli made with morsels of heath- 
cock, meat and giblets; Jural or Swiss cheese to flavor every- 
thing. 

The dishes of Franche-Comte, like those of Alsace-Lorraine 
also show teutonic influence, as seen in La Concoillote, butter 
and sour milk flavored with brandy and cooked together with 
herbs; and the favorite schnapps, which is kirsch. Germany and 
Spain unite in the huge sausage flavored with aniseed and de- 
voutly named Jesu de Morteau; and again in German pan- 
cakes as thick as your thumb, yet these have a Spanish name, 
Matafams, hunger-killers, reminiscent of the Spanish anis drink 
Mataratas, rat-killer. 

Other regional foods and drinks are roast ears of corn, grilled 
crayfish, Septmoncel cheese, called "blue" from its bluish gray 
color, and lacy morels. Anyone who has tasted morels, that 
sweet-scented pine-cone-shaped pale white cross between mush- 
rooms and truffles, has begun an endless education in taste. 
Morels make rare eating. The wines are from sherry-producing 
vines introduced by the Spaniards and hence the best of them 



3 i8 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

are white and fruity: Chateau Chalon, Arbois, Poligny and 
Beaufort. Also vins de paille, of grapes laid down in straw 
till mid-winter and then made into wine. Wines here are also 
cooked with brandy and sugar to make exceptional liqueurs and 
one of them, Epicea, is flavored with pine, in the popular fashion 
of Scandinavia.

Cut fresh bacon in half inch strings, and lard the meat, 
making the incisions run the same direction as the grain. Lay 
in deep bowl. Mix brandy with onion, parsley, thyme, celery 
leaves, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, bay leaf, and garlic, and pour 
over the meat; marinate 2-3 hours, turning meat from time to 
time. In deep pot-roast kettle, fry minced bacon. Drain meat 
and dredge with flour. Brown all over with the bacon, pork 
rinds and calf's foot. Take out meats. To contents of the pot 
add wine, stock, shallots, and strained marinating liquid. Let 
come to a boil, and replace meats. Proceed as with a pot roast, 
over low heat, keeping closely covered with weight on pot cover, 
never letting the liquid boil. Keep the stock hot, and add when 
more liquid is necessary. At the end of the 3rd hour add carrots, 
cut in eighths, and onions. Season. When done, take up, remove 
fat from pot liquor, and thicken slightly. 

LEFT-OVER SOUP MEAT 
{Bouilli) 

Bouilli au Gratin — Cut the boiled beef into thin slices, 
after having first browned some onions in butter, and fry meat 
"white" in this onion sauce. Add a tablespoonful of consomme, 
a little tomato puree, salt, pepper, parsley and chopped garlic. 
Place in a casserole or stone crock and cover with bread crumbs; 
add bits of butter and bring it to a golden brown in the oven. 

Bouilli sur le Gril — Place the sliced boiled beef on grill 
as you would a steak, and serve it hot with a mustard or tomato 
sauce. Even the famous maitre d'hotel sauce is quite at home 
with this dish. 

Frites — Cut the boiled beef into little cubes; cut some onions 



322 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

into thin slices, or use tiny ones. Brown the onions in butter or 
in the fat from a beef -roast, then add the cubes of beef; salt, 
pepper, and chopped parsley. Let the whole brown over a low 
flame as you stir it slowly. Now add boiled potatoes cut in 
cubes. A creamy sauce will form as you cook, which can be 
enriched by adding a little meat broth. 

In the region of Bordeaux they make of this "left-over" a 
dish that comes close to being a "grand plat." Tiny onions 
browned in butter are added to the boiled beef cut into small 
pieces. This is seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. A table- 
spoon of consomme, a glass of dry white wine, garlic, parsley, 
both well chopped, and a little butter are added, and mixture 
is cooked for 10 minutes while the sauce reduces to one fourth.

This leg of mutton stuffed with pickled pork is only one of

array of local dishes, all the way from the sailor's bouillabaisse 
and couscous in the Arabian restaurants of the old port at 
Marseilles to the conventionalized plats served a la financiere

York City, from the chop suey palaces of Chinatown up to the 
African chitterling dives in Harlem. Yet the chief influence is 
Italian, characterized by the anchovies that go into everything. 

Hors d'ceuvres : eggs and olives stuffed with anchovies, tunny 
in oil, the sausage of Aries, oursins, mullet caviar with oil, onions 
and eggs chopped together, raw artichokes, anchovy patties. 

Dishes Provencal: omelet of mussels, eggs poached in olive 
oil, pot-au-feu, octopus en daube, squid farcies, snail fritters, 
garlic mayonnaise, whitebait pancake, sheeps' trotters and tripe 
stewed in strong stock, le fassum Grassois (cabbage and lettuce 
boiled in broth with milt, pork and rice). 

The honey of Grasse, scented by perfume-making bees in 
this town where the most subtle scents are distilled and bottled 
for export. In the perfume shops fountains jet up rose, violet, 
heliotrope, carnation and out in the flower-fields lovesick swains 
commit suicide by crawling into caverns where the scent-makers 
store their rose petals. Here they fall into a last sweet sleep, 
suffocated by the overpowering aroma. In such a heaven of 
odors no wonder the bees turn out honeys to match the boudoir 
bottles of Quelques Fleurs, Dans la Nuit, Attar of Roses, Pour 
un Homme, Bellogia. Here you can chose a honey to match 
your favorite imported French perfume. Candied violets, jas- 
mine, mimosa, rose petals, orange blossoms, too.

The country cheese of ewes' milk, known as petits Barrons, 
comes in a small brick wrapped in a great big vine leaf, and 
before it leaves home the cheese is well soused with brandy. The 
mountain cheese Cachat is as strong as Gibraltar, highly sea- 
soned and simply reeling with brandy and white wine. 

The almond tarts of Aix, honeyed nougats, sweet nut biscuits 
aux Avelines — but best of all, a watermelon iced, au Vin: 

Cut out the heart only, in balls, remove all seeds in the re- 
maining hole and fill it two-thirds full of Chateauneuf-du-Pape 
wine. Put the iced melon balls back into the cavity and eat with 
the wine sauce. 

Chateauneuf-du-Pape is fruity and mellow and comes either 
white or red, though Provence is distinguished for its pink 
wines, Vin Rosee, forming a class in themselves, but little known 
outside of France. Tavel is the best of these. 

The Nicois have the fine wine of Bellet and the excellent 
petit vins of La Gaude and St. Jeannette.

corns and salt and slowly fry. When vegetables begin to color 
lay in the halves of neck and fry, turning often and carefully 
until vegetables are lightly browned. Have stock boiling hot, 
and pour on enough to cover. Simmer until tender. Drain 
well. Brush with egg, sprinkle with crumbs and brown slowly 
under grill. Remove herbs and peppercorns from liquid. Re- 
duce to a rich sauce. 

The Cous de Mouton Sainte Menehould is well worth the 
loving care bestowed on it. The dish is interesting in that three 
cooking processes go into its making, namely, frying, stewing, 
and grilling. Many of the recipes of the Champagne district 
owe their fame to two cooking processes, usually braising or 
stewing, and baking or grilling. The town of Sainte Menehould 
has given its name to this class of cooking, the origin of which 
is obscured in the middle ages. 

At least two other countries have their twice-cooked dishes 
from remote antiquity. The Portuguese like their pork fried 
and then simmered, and the Southern Germans stew the hum- 
bler cuts of veal and then bread and bake them.

butter, add bacon, and then veal rolls, and fry until nicely 
browned. Add hot meat broth and simmer until done, 20-30 
minutes. Reduce liquid and slightly thicken with flour. Serve 
with a dish of mushroom sautes. 

The city of Lyons is second only to Paris for French feast- 
ing. Among its specialties are omelet of chicken liver, truffles 
and onions, Matelote stewed in the red juice of Beaujolais wine, 
gras-double a la Lyonnaise (tripe in spite of its name), quenelles 
(forcemeat of young rabbit) and Lyonnaise potatoes, now inter- 
national. 

Here the wines of the C6te-du-Rhone are enjoyed: whites: 
Saint-Peray and Chateau Grillet; reds of the Cote-Rotie, St. 
Michel and the Fleurie of Beaujolais. Also St. Lager, the most 
inappropriate name ever given to a wine. Liqueurs as well, 
made of green walnuts, and of maiden hair fern distilled with 
orange flower water.

Garnish with egg slices and croutons, and sprinkle all with 
parsley and tarragon. 

Dauphiny 

SWEETBREADS DAUPHINY STYLE 
(Ris de Veau Dauphinoise) 

1 pair sweetbreads 1 teaspoon minced parsley 
5 tablespoons sweet butter % cup tomato puree 

Salt and pepper Juice l / 2 lemon 

2 shallots, minced 1 cup hot rich meat gravy 

Soak sweetbreads 2 hours in plenty of cold water. Blanch 
and remove skin and veins, then slice or dice. Heat 2 tablespoons 
butter, add sweetbreads, season, and saute until lightly colored. 

Make a Valentinoise sauce thus: Heat remaining butter and 
slowly fry shallots until tender, but only slightly colored. Add 
remaining ingredients, heat, and add to sweetbreads. 

The Alpine province of Dauphiny abounds in walnuts, so 
the oil of this nut is used in cooking in place of olive oil — as 
the Nicois uses peanut oil (huile de raschid) because it is 
cheaper. 

Long under Roman rule, Dauphiny carries down its ancient 
traditions of cooking, notably in sprinkling many dishes with 
grated cheese. Our own familiar potatoes au gratin was in- 
vented in Dauphiny within a century after Sir Walter took the 
first spuds from Virginia across to his estate near Cork, and 
from there let them spread all over Europe. The Dauphinois 
grate up their Saint-Marcellino or Sassenage hard cheeses and 
dust it over dishes of fish, game and vegetables. They use a

328 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

good deal of Alpine butter and cream in the kitchen, too, and 
also a creamy-white truffle native to the locality. 

We must pass over their pet plates of pig's liver and blood 
to recommend chicken-liver mousse a la Valentinoise in their 
stead, or shad, another distinctive dish of Valence, put to pan 
on a bed of shallots, onions and sorrel, taken up when almost 
done, doused with white wine and brandy and finished off in 
the oven. 

A sweet souffle is made of pumpkin; and the regional baba 
is called pogne de Romans. It is soaked in rum in the classical 
manner, though rum of course is not native to Dauphiny. Char- 
treuse is, however, and again, thanks to the Church of Rome, 
this province has its own great wine Hermitage, still made at the 
old Roman monastery.

add veal, cut in small pieces, onion, j^> garlic clove and shallots. 
Slowly fry but do not brown. Add parsley, thyme, bay leaf, 
the simmering giblets with their liquor, seasonings, and i cup 
champagne. Cover and cook until liquid is reduced and mix- 
ture is nearly dry. Remove herbs. Cool. Add egg yolks and 
mix well. Season chicken, fill with the mixture and sew up 
the apertures; lay in a deep saucepan — an earthenware casserole 
is better — with 2 cups of champagne, cloves, mace and pepper- 
corns, garlic and leek. Cover closely and simmer, basting and 
turning occasionally. Drain and wipe dry. Roll in beaten egg 
and crumbs, and quickly brown under grill. Strain contents 
of pan and serve as a sauce. 

It will be noted that this poulet a la Champenoise is both 
stuffed and stewed with champagne. But this is nothing un- 
common in the Champagne district where the regional cooking 
calls for the great local wine about as often as it does for water. 
Recipes specify boiling carp, pike, even eels, in the distinguished 



330 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

product of the Ay district. But fortunately for local recipes the 
wine meant is of the cheap, still variety, not of the sparkling 
type as we know it, and of course of less than one-tenth the 
price, yet fully as flavorsome. 

Ay is the name of the district where this province's finest 
wines are produced, and of course all of them are still, until 
treated and bottled, doctored with syrup and spirits and made 
into the export article. We would not recognize as champagnes 
the names of the district by which the wines are known locally: 
Ay, Ambonnay, Epernay, Verzenay — the ayes have it! Sillery 
and Gramant, Bouzy and Dizy, too. Verzy, Sacy, Jouy, Oger, 
Moussy, Rilly — they sound made up for the Anglo-American 
trade. Yet these are the names of the natural wines that go into 
practically all dishes Champenoise. Even the vinegars were 
originally these. In making the salade Champenoise, composed 
of sliced boiled potatoes piping hot and uncooked dandelion 
greens, both champagne and champagne vinegar are mixed in 
the fat in which bacon is fried, and then the whole panful goes 
over the salad to wilt the greens and savor the potatoes. 

Reed birds, even song birds, are sauteed with sweetbreads 
and mushrooms and then doused with champagne. Desserts 
consume a lot of the local beverage, but not nearly so much of 
it as the townspeople of Reims, where the great wine is on 
draught, both sparkling and still, and is as freely drunk as beer 
in Hoboken, though in smaller doses. A special sweet pink 
and white biscuit is made on purpose to nibble with the flute- 
ful of bubbly water, and it is well known that these biscuits 
of Reims do but increase the thirst for it, even as pretzels do 
for malt drinks. Lady fingers, too, are almost a convention with 
this wine, and a bottle is usually accompanied by a plate of 
them, piled up log-cabin style. 

If you like, you can drink red champagne, but alas, all of 
the latter is without sparkle. It is called bruit or nature, either 



FRENCH

red or white and many Frenchmen will drink nothing else but 
the natural white with oysters.

Lightly dredge chicken with flour. Start frying bacon in 
olive oil; add shallot and chicken and brown quickly for 5-8 
minutes, turning the pieces so as to color on all sides. Add wine 
and artichoke bottoms, cut in quarters. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, cover closely and simmer slowly 15-25 minutes, uncover- 
ing to baste once or twice. Add beef extract, lemon juice and 
parsley, and shake the pan to mix. Take up, make a gravy of 
remaining contents of the pan, and pour over, or serve in a 
boat. Garnish the platter with small artichokes, sauteed.

332 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

Soak bread in water and squeeze dry. Add veal, ham, 
onion, parsley, thyme, bay leaf and seasonings and put through 
food grinder. Mix thoroughly with egg. Stuff chicken and 
sew up. Roast with butter, basting frequently. 

CRAYFISH BUTTER 

Wash crayfish. Boil remaining ingredients except wine and 
butter in 2 quarts of water for l / 2 hour. Strain, add wine, bring 
to a boil, add crayfish and cook 20 minutes. Let cool in liquor. 
Drain, saving liquid; shell and save tails. Grind shells fine and 
mix with melted butter. Heat 5 minutes. Cool slightly and 
rub through a sieve into ice water. Gather up butter, heat, add 
tails and serve with chicken. 

The chicken farmers of Bresse have mastered the art of fat- 
tening their birds much as the geese farmers of Strasbourg have 
specialized on the secret of fattening the livers for pate de foie 
gras. Bresse chickens are shipped all over France and can be 
bought at the best poultry markets in all cities. 

Due to forced fattening, the livers of Bresse chickens become 
enormous, though not as gigantic as the goose livers of Stras- 
bourg, which sometimes weigh pounds. The chicken livers of 
Bresse are boiled, pounded to powder and stirred with milk and 
eggs into a supreme nutmeg-flavored mousse. 

The Province of Bresse was long under Spanish domination, 
so it still uses the corn flour and watermelon pickles of that 
country, the pickles being either sour for appetizers or sweet 
for dessert. 

Cardoons flourish here, sizable thistles that never quite be- 
come artichokes. They have leaves like the acanthus and the 
whole stalky plant, except the root, is browned with truffles and 
juices from roast chicken or turkey. 

An attractive dish of the district is apple slices covered with 
batter and baked on cabbage leaves well buttered.

CHICKEN IN THE STYLE OF BEAUNE

Salt and pepper i dozen large mushrooms

% pound butter % cup brandy 

i herb bouquet i pint thick cream 

Salt and pepper chicken inside and out. Spread with butter 
and place herb bouquet inside, then roast, preferably in a covered 
casserole, turning and basting from time to time. When done 
remove bouquet, surround it with well washed and dried mush- 
rooms and truffles slices. Cover and simmer 8-10 minutes. Pour 
over it brandy and hot cream, and serve in the casserole in which 
it was baked. (This dish is better when made on top of the 
stove, but requires much care and attention to prevent undue 

browning.) 

6 DUCK IN A CHEMISE 

(Canard en Chemise) 

1 tender duck 2 sprigs parsley 

Salt and pepper Pastry dough 

1 sprig celery Pate de foie gras 

Prepare duck, rub inside and out with salt and pepper, and 
lay herbs inside. Roll out pastry dough sufficient to envelop 
the duck. Lay duck, breast upward, on pastry, cover breast with 
foie gras (or with a paste made by frying livers and giblets with 
plenty of fat bacon, pepper and seasoning, and pounding until 
they form a thick mass). After the paste is evenly spread over 
the duck, carefully fold pastry over it and pinch the edges to- 
gether. Lay in a pan and bake in the oven, then transfer to 
platter. 

Brought to the table the dish looks like a large mound of 
pastry, and should be carved, as it is in France. For this is not 



334 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

a dinner-party dish, but one to be enjoyed among intimates. 
The host, who in France is always an expert carver, runs a 
sharp knife round the crust at the bottom. The top crust is 
taken or? and sent to the side table; for the great delicacy, to be 
carefully portioned, is the crust beneath the duck into which the 
foie gras has soaked. The upper crust, it is remarked in a 
French cook book, may be served to the children, or to the poor 
relation who is not supposed to know the difference. 

DUCKLING WITH SOUR ORANGES 

(Caneton a la Bigarde) 

i duckling 3 tablespoons butter 

Salt and pepper 1 orange, rind and juice 

3 cooked carrots, sliced 1 small glass currant jelly 

2 onions, sliced Toasted bread 

1 orange, sectioned 

Roast duckling 20 minutes in hot oven. Season, reduce heat 
to moderate and allow 20 minutes more for each pound. Fry 
the carrots and onions in a little of the butter until the onions 
are brown, and add. Cut the orange rind into thin strips and 
cook in a little hot water until they are soft, and add. Add 
orange juice and jelly to the duck gravy in the roasting pan. 
Heat until jelly is melted, mixing well. Place the duck on the 
toast, decorate the breast with fresh orange sections. Serve gravy 
in a boat. 

The bigarde is the sour orange of Seville, exported to a 
number of neighboring countries. It is excellent for cooking. 
A large portion of the Spanish crop goes to England, where it 
is made up into the tangy marmalade which appears on every 
English breakfast table and is shipped to America in small stone 
jars, under well known brands.

Wipe the goose and season inside and out with salt and

seasonings. Pare apples, cut in quarters and cook with f/2 cup 
cider, cloves and mace. Cool, mash, add applejack and add to 
pork mixture, mixing well. Stuff goose and sew up apertures. 
Lay pork rind in deep pot, and place goose on top. Heat stock 
and remaining cider together and pour over. Add onion, leek, 
and carrot. Cook rapidly 10 minutes, then cover and simmer, 
turning occasionally, until done. Take up. Skim fat from 
liquid and thicken. Serve apple marmalade on the side. 

The French speak of Normandy la Grasse, "the fat," and 
they ought to know. Cream-fattened, cider-swelled, cheese- 
stuffed, this rich province tucks her legs under the mahogany 
to gorge on the cuisine a la creme: tripes a la mode de Caen, 
the buttered ducks of Rouen on which apple-jack is burned and 
not considered wasted, mussels stewed in cream, lobster with 
shrimp butter sauce, the shrimp themselves big, blush-rose beau- 
ties. Sole sauteed in cider, wine-soused mackerel, chitterlings

famous in Normandy as Madame Bougay's breakfast eggs were 
in New Orleans. For drinks champagne cider, sparkling and 
heady, and the native Calvados. Try the pre-Civil War apple 
jack, bottled in i860. 

Besides being a fat, creamy cuisine, Normandy is further 
enriched by her fermented and distilled apple juice. The use 
of both cider and Calvados in one dish, with apple marmalade 
on the side, as in the oie en daube above, sets her aside from the 
usual wine-cooking of France. But the fact that she is the proud 
mother of the soft and aromatic cheeses, Camembert, Port-Salut 
and Pont-1'eveque brings her back into the fold. In the Nor- 
mandy town where Camembert originated there is a stately 
statue to the lady who invented it. Today there is the "Syndicat 
du Vrai Camembert" which stamps its proud name on the tiny 
round wooden boxes of the genuine article. 

For a distinctive sweet try the apple marmalade souffle with 
whipped cream and Calvados ablaze (see recipe).

If this dish is being prepared in a hunting camp, truffled

Salt and pepper i l / 2 pounds sauerkraut 

2 partridges or 1 pheasant 1 cup peeled and sliced apples 
Bacon slices l / 2 cup white wine 

3 tablespoons goose fat or butter 1 tablespoon flour 

Salt and pepper birds. Wrap in bacon slices and tie securely 
with twine. Heat fat and brown bacon-wrapped bird lightly. 
Wash sauerkraut in cold water, drain and wring dry. Place a 
layer of kraut with several apple slices in bottom of a deep fire- 
proof dish or casserole and imbed the birds. Cover with kraut 
and rest of apple slices. Pour the wine over, adding a little water. 
Cover closely and let simmer and steam for iJ^-2 hours. Take 
up birds. Thicken kraut with flour. Make nests in the kraut 
and replace birds. Serve in same dish. 

M. Andre Simon, chief fork of the London Wine and Food 
Society, says: "A partridge, in French gastronomic parlance, is 
always masculine, whatever its sex, when young and tender: un 
perdreau. When no longer young nor quite so tender, it is in- 
variably feminine, une perdrix. The spit and an open fire and its 
own juice suit the perdreau admirably, but the perdrix is at her 
best in a soft nest of well-cooked cabbage."

Cassoulet is the dish that Sheila Hibben deservedly calls 
"that divine gift of the Midi." The recipe differs slightly in 
the various districts. In Carcassonne pork chops and garlic are 
added; in Toulouse, a portion of leg of mutton or lamb; in Bas 
Languedoc, juniper berries; in Gascony, white wine and browned 
pork; in Perigord, truffles, of course, and stuffed gooseneck, 
with juniper berries. Limosin makes a cassoulet without confit 
d'oie. And Alsace, home of the goose, and a pate de foie gras, 
seizes upon the Languedocian invention with enthusiasm, and 
adds the calf's foot and knuckle, and smoked ham and smoked 
sausage, with which other fine Alsatian dishes are adorned. 

SAUCE OF CHIVES 

(Sauce Civette) 

1 slice fresh white bread Salt 

4 egg yolks, hard-boiled Pepper 

2 tablespoons olive oil Vinegar 

Sugar (granulated) 1 tablespoon chives, chopped fine 

Cut away bread crusts, soak the soft center in water, squeeze 
dry and rub with egg yolks through hair sieve. Stir in the olive 
oil, season sour-sweet to taste. When smooth, whip in the 
chives. 

In French the word civette means both civet cat and chives. 
It is not to be confounded with civet, the French word for 
jugged hare or stewed rabbit; yet there is a close connection 
between cat and rabbit, for the domestic cat often takes the place 
of the wild hare or rabbit in the French jug or stew, so we may 
surmise that this dish took its name not from the chives with 
which it is sometimes cooked, but from a playful substitution 



342 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

of wild cat, or civet cat, for the hare. In Paris an alley cat is 
also called a "roof rabbit."

VOL-AU-VENT A LA TOULOUSE 

i chicken breast, cooked i cup white sauce 

i sweetbread cooked in chicken *4 cup white wine 

broth Salt and pepper 

Tiny chicken quenelles Patty or puff paste shells 
Sliced truffle 

Cut chicken and sweetbread in small dice; simmer a few 
minutes, with quenelles and truffle, in white sauce mixed with 
wine. Season; fill shells with mixture, allowing i quenelle and 
i bit of truffle for each. Set in oven and heat. (An addition of 
mushrooms, minced ham, and bits of cocks' combs, is in order 
if the vol-au-vents are being made in any quantity.) 

Recipes for vol-au-vent are legion, since their daintiness is a 
challenge to the ingenuity of the cook. The filling may be any 
tasty little ragout. Some of the best known are: vol-au-vent a 
la financiere, with a ragout of olives, mushrooms, sweetbreads, 
green peas, truffles, and cocks' combs, in a wine-flavored sauce; 
a la Normande, with fillet of sole, oysters, mussels and mush- 
rooms; a la Macedoine, with carrots, turnips, peas, string beans 
and cauliflower in Bechamel sauce; au salmon a la ravigote, with 
salmon, scallops, and white sauce; and vol-au-vent de Brandade, 
filled with brandade (see recipe). Other vol-au-vents, under 
various names, are filled with either feathered or furred game, 
always with truffles or mushrooms; with ragouts having as their 
base veal or pork, or chicken giblets; and the simplest ones are 
made with chopped hard-boiled egg in sauce or cheese fondu 
filling.

QUENELLES 

Quenelles have come to mean any forcemeat, bound with 
tgg, and moulded and rounded between two teaspoons dipped 
in hot water. But at one time the material used was young . 
rabbit, as the name indicates — connil, a young coney. They are 
cooked in boiling salted water and used as a garnish for soup 
or entrees, or served as a separate dish. The Germans have 
elaborated on the quenelle in their many meat dumplings, which 
they have made into an important feature of their cuisine. But 
the French meat balls are daintier, and a number are worth 
describing. 

Quenelles au Foie d'Oie, so nearly German that it hails 
from Alsace, is made of mashed fat goose liver held together 
with egg, and cooked in an Alsatian Tokay locally known as 
Klevner. 

Quenelles de Veau Dauphinioise: Finely grind veal, work 
to a paste with a little butter, yolk of egg and cream, season 
with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Poach in broth flavored with 
thyme and serve in a sauce of butter, flour, meat broth, tomato 
and white wine. 

Quenelles Lyonnaise: Grind a thick slice of pike and work 
with beef marrow, some puff paste, and beaten egg white. Form 
quenelles of cylindrical shape and cook in boiling salted water; 
drain and serve with sauce Nantua (see recipe). Sprinkle with 
grated Gruyere cheese. (Some enterprising cook of Lyons no 
doubt borrowed this from Nantua.) 

Quenelles de Truites a la Savoyarde: Grind trout, mix 
with bread crumbs soaked in cream. Serve with crayfish sauce 
and garnish with crayfish tails.

of the gravy during the frying. Drain ofif any extra fat. Sprinkle

very hot. 

NAPOLEON PUFF POTATOES 

(Pommes de Terre Souffles) 

Cut raw potatoes in oval- or almond-shaped pieces about J4 
inch thick and 2 inches long; lay in cold water l / 2 hour. Dry 
well and cook in medium hot deep fat 8-10 minutes without 
browning. Drain and set aside to cool on strainer. Then fry 
golden in smoking hot fat, shaking occasionally and gently dur- 
ing the process. Drain on paper and serve at once on a folded 
napkin. 

A paper napkin will serve quite as well as a linen napkin, 
still used abroad where laundry is cheap. 

Although these pufled potatoes were named after Napoleon 
he had nothing whatsoever to do with them, and it is doubtful 
if he ever tasted any. Neither he nor his Empress Louise were 
distinguished as cooks or epicures and the dishes they some- 
times concocted were amateurish indeed. Napoleon's immediate 
predecessors, the Louises, were great trenchermen, however, and 
spent a good deal of time in the palace kitchen. Louis XIII 
killed his own game, surpassed his own royal gardeners at raising 
vegetables and cooked them splendidly himself, since he lived 
in constant dread of being poisoned. And this is the reason 
that many monarchs have excelled in culinary arts. Louis XV 
was not a gardener, but a great hunter and discriminating cook. 
Louis XVI has left no mark as a cook and he alone of them 
was not even a first-class gourmet, although a great eater. The 
history of the French cuisine sparkles with the names of royal 
cooks, their cooking courtiers and personal chefs, although most 
of the dishes have lost their original significance in republican 
France. 









346 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

The origin of these pommes de terre souffles and how they 
came to be nicknamed "Napoleon" still makes a dinner table 
story in France where all dishes are "discussed," as a part of the 
savor of their eating. It seems that a simple housewife in early 
Empire days set aside her sizzling panful of pommes frites, 
French-fried, to rush to the front window and ogle at Bonaparte 
riding by at the head of his troops, in all the glitter and fool's- 
gold of battle. An hour later, when this susceptible housewife 
came out of her trance and got back to the kitchen, her pan of 
potatoes lay cold and soggy with grease. "Ou la la!" a catastrophe 
indeed, for she expected her husband home every minute and 
there was nothing else to eat in the house. 

So, instead of throwing them away, the thrifty lady, trained 
in economic sacrifices made necessary by keeping up Napoleon's 
army, made the best of it, putting her spuds on the fire again. 
But behold! they puffed up miraculously, became crisp shells 
full of air, bursting fat and round as toy balloons, tiny sausages, 
or emperors. So the twice-fried potato puffs came into being 
by accident and were named after the Napoleon story which ran 
from tongue to tongue all over France.

4 cups mashed potatoes i egg 

Salt and pepper i teaspoon caramel 

2 tablespoons butter, melted 4 tablespoons Calvados, 

% cup apple marmalade or aged applejack 

1 cup thick cream, whipped 

Choose old potatoes which will be light and fluffy. When 
smoothly mashed add salt and pepper, butter, and marmalade 
which has been warmed over steam; mash together thoroughly. 
Cool potatoes somewhat; beat in cream, egg yolk and caramel;

fold in egg white stiffly beaten. Heap in a rough pile on a 
fireproof dish, and place in moderate oven (350 F.) to heat and 
set egg, but do not brown. Pour the applejack over and flare. 
It makes a pretty ceremony to burn the applejack at the table. 
(Poor or new applejack will not give the proper results. And, 
of course, Calvados or Normandy apple brandy is best.) Serve 
with game, duck, or pork. 

MASHED POTATOES AND CHESTNUTS 

(Puree de Pommes et Matrons) 

An equal weight of potatoes and chestnuts. Pare the pota- 
toes; shell, blanch and peel chestnuts. Put the potatoes and 
chestnuts in boiling water in 2 separate pans. Cook until tender. 
Run together through potato ricer, add salt and pepper and a 
tablespoonful of butter. Mix thoroughly. Add 1 cup cream 
and beat until very light. Heat over steam and serve. 

Nwernais LETTUCE A LA NIVERNAISE

Wilt the lettuce in melted butter. Add beef broth to half 
cover, season, cover and simmer. Turn after 8 minutes. Un- 
cover, simmer and baste. Parboil carrots in salted water; drain; 
brown in butter with the sugar; add a little broth and simmer,

Bordelais MUSHROOMS BORDELAISE 

(Cepes a la Bordelaise) 

Yi pound mushrooms 2 shallots, minced fine 
Ys pound butter 2 tablespoons lemon juice 

Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon minced parsley 

Cut off all but ]/2 inch of the mushroom stems. Let lie for 
a few minutes in plenty of cold water, first right side up, then 
upside down. Dry on a linen towel. Cut in thin slices through 
the stem. Heat butter to near smoking. Add part of the mush- 
room slices and toss and turn in the butter. Add the rest, season, 
fry for a moment, add shallots, and let fry 2 minutes. Cover 
closely, reduce heat and smother 2-4 minutes. Add lemon juice, 
and parsley, and serve at once in a hot dish. 

HOP SPROUTS 
(Jets de Houblons) 

Young hop sprouts, in the spring, are succulent and edible, 
resembling asparagus. They are imported to America in cans, 
although there is no reason why hop sprouts should not be a 
garden crop in the United States. 

They should be heated in their own liquid and served with 
hot butter, or with Hollandaise sauce. 

STUFFED SQUASH BLOSSOMS 

(Fleurs de Courge Farcie) 

The male, or false, blossoms which close and fall from 
squash and pumpkin vines are gathered up and sold by the 
bushel in French markets; to be prepared thus: 

Gently open flowers sufficiently to insert a stuffing of chicken 
or veal forcemeat (or simply chopped hard-boiled egg mixed 
with butter and bread crumbs). Lay stuffed flowers side by side 
in a baking tin, pouring into pan a little veal or chicken broth 



FRENCH 349 

(or just water in which has been dissolved a teaspoon of beef 
extract); sprinkle with salt and white pepper, and simmer. 

The blossoms retain their vivid golden color and make a 
decorative garnishing for a meat or vegetable dish. They beau- 
tifully frame a platter of heaped fresh green peas, and delight 
the heart of the amateur gardener, who will cease to bemoan 
the fact that every bloom on the vine is not a promise of a 
Halloween pumpkin. 

Provence VEGETABLE RAGOUT 

(Melange de Legumes) 

3 young carrots, diced i large tomato, peeled 

2 cups meat broth i large onion, sliced 

6 scallions i garlic clove, minced 

i small zucchini (or tgg plant) 2 tablespoons olive oil 

Salt and pepper i green pepper, sliced 

Drop carrots into boiling broth, add scallions with portion 
of green left on. Cut zucchini (Italian green squash resembling 
cucumber) into Y 2 inch slices, and add. Season. Set tomato in 
center of stewing vegetables whole. Fry onion and garlic in oil 
until golden, add % cup cold water and simmer. Add green 
pepper to vegetables. Pour over them the liquid from onion 
and garlic and discard these. Simmer for a moment. Serve on 
a hot platter. Vegetables except tomato should be unbroken. 

Provence PANISSES 

Panisses f rites, (fried), are a boon to the hurried housewife 
in Provence, and housewives are hurried on occasion, even in 
that easy-going land of poetry where it is nothing to bestow 6 
hours of loving care on a dish of braised meat; or keep the fire 
going all night in order to produce that rival to tripes a la mode 
de Caen, the pieds et paquets a la Marseilles. This consists of 



350 THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 

mutton tripe used as wrappers for a delectable stuffing, and 
cooked in white wine and stock with sheeps' trotters, beef shin, 
veal, and vegetables in a covered earthen crock sealed air-tight 
with flour paste. 

Panisses can be bought, ready to fry, usually at the cheese 
shop, in many Provencal towns, and are handy when unexpected 
guests arrive. They measure about 3 inches, square or round, 
are l / 2 inch thick, and yellow. The best are made of a thick 
puree of chick peas cooked in stock further thickened with 
flour, cooled, and then cut in slices and formed between the 
hands. The panisses are dredged with flour and fried in butter. 
An American substitute may be made by pressing canned chick 
peas through a sieve with 1 tablespoon flour, with enough of 
the chick pea liquor to permit the mixture being heated until 
the flour is cooked. 

A proper panisse, however, according to old Provencal cooks, 
should be stirred only with a paddle made of laurel wood, for 
both luck and flavor. 

Provence AIQU 

8 garlic cloves i}4 cups olive oil 

1 egg yolk Juice l / 2 lemon 

Ya teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon tepid water 

Grind garlic cloves to a paste; add egg yolk and blend; add 
salt and a few drops of oil and blend, adding oil until 4 table- 
spoons have been used. Then add lemon juice a little at a time 
and beat; add water and continue beating. Then slowly add 
the rest of the oil, proceeding as with mayonnaise. 

For the garlic-lover this is a delicious sauce, and the "Aioli 
Garni" or "grand aioli" with which it is sometimes served is a 
complete and beautiful repast. Almost anything in the kitchen 
may appear on a platter of "grand aioli" — hard-boiled eggs, 



FRENCH 351 

baked potatoes, carrots, onions chopped with fennel, artichokes, 
snails, codfish or other fish, or shell fish — always appetizingly 
arranged, with the sauce heaped in the center or served in a 
boat. 

The aioli also figures in la bourride, slices of fish stewed 
and highly seasoned with herbs after the manner of aigo sau, 
the broth being thickened with a generous quantity of aioli and 
then poured over toast, and the fish being served separately. 

lle-de-France p ARIS I AN SALAD 

{Salad e Parisienne) 

This is the familiar salad served with most table d'hotes,

salad, enriched with hard-boiled eggs, spiced with onion and 
made meaty with snips of veal, tongue or beef muzzle, well 
peppered and dressed with oil and wine vinegar. In season let- 
tuce is added.

THE EUROPEAN COOKBOOK 




Mix ground almonds, 2*4 cups powdered sugar, citron, or- 
ange and lemon peel together. Flavor with salt, vanilla and 
lemon juice. When thoroughly incorporated lightly fold in 
beaten egg whites. Shape in rounds with spoon on a buttered, 
lightly floured baking sheet. Make a depression in center of

let stand l / 2 hour. Bake in moderately hot oven (375° F.). Place 
a candied cherry, other chopped candied fruit or jelly in the 
depression in the centers. Cool and serve. 

Although France borrowed the macaroon from her southern 
neighbors she added her culinary genius to it, especially in gar- 
nishing with fruits and jellies, making the macaroon almost a 
nougat. And besides that she classified them into sees, parfaits 
and fins; those of Amiens, (with apple jelly) St. Emilion, Bay- 
onne and Touraine being the most exquisite.

forms a ball in pan. Remove from fire, stir in eggs i at a time, 
and beat 2 minutes between each addition. Add sugar and 
flower-water last. Drop by spoonfuls into hot deep fat. Cakes 
should brown on one side, and rise to top of fat; turn, and brown 
on other side; remove, and drain on brown paper. Fat must 
not be too hot or cakes will brown before they puff out; and if 
not hot enough, they will absorb the fat. Test by dropping in 
a bread cube. If it browns in 60 seconds, the fat is of the right 
temperature.

day menu of a dozen of Paris's finest restaurants, and even the 
humblest eating places feature one or another of them as their 
plat de jour (dish of the day). Each has its own original entrees 
and tarte de maison, as well. This is made possible only because 
the choicest of foodstuffs, as well as the finest of wines, flow 
into Paris from every provincial corner and colonial possession, 
Algiers and Corsica nearby, Martinique and Tahiti, halfway 
around the world. 

The main market of Paris, Les Halles, is beyond doubt the 
best stocked in the world. Live fish, lobsters and eels in tanks, 
truffles, mushrooms and morels, any luxury you fancy, be it 
Beluchistan caviare, bar-le-duc or white truffles. In the vast 
meat halls prime meats and game, ranging from capons to boar's 
head, sausages of an ingenuity almost teutonic. 

But these are bought up for the elite and the morning 
throngs of Parisians jostle each other in filling their baskets with 
the giblets, tripe, lungs, pigs' hearts, parts that we in our waste- 
fulness throw away. Yet every basket is gay with a bouquet of 
flowers and cheerful with mushrooms peeping out over the edge, 
since the Capital itself supplies the whole nation with cham- 
pignons grown right under the city, in the deserted catacombs. 
Wherever you travel, from Nice to Strasbourg you get the 
standardized champignons de Paris.
