PREFACE. 

As a general rule, I do not believe in prefaces, but feeling 
bound to submit to the time-honored custom, I am free to con- 
fess that had I known the labor necessary to produce a first- 
class "Cookery Book," I should hardly have had the 
resolution to commence it. However, I have done my utmost 
to make it useful and acceptable to the ladies of the Dominion 
of Canada. The recipes have been most carefully compiled, 
and valuable assistance has been rendered me by friends in the 
British Isles, France, Germany and the United States, to all of 
whom I tender my most sincere thanks. I also desire to 
record my grateful appreciation of the immense success my 
'•Cookery Book" has met with. The number of orders 
already received for it convinces me that I have supplied a real 
want, and that my book will help my sisters to lighten their 
toil and gladden the hearts of their families.

INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS 



"The number of inhabitants who may be suppo ted in any country 
upon its internal produce depends about as much unon the state of tlie Art 
of Cookery as upon that of Agriculture; but if Oxjkerybe of so much 
importance, it certainly deserves to be studied with the grcitest of care. 
Cookery and Agriculture are arts of civilized nations. Savages understand 
neither oi them."— Count KumforiTs Works, Vol. I. 

The importance of the Art of Cookery is very great ; in- 
deed, from the richest to the poorest the selection and prepara- 
tion of food often becomes ific chief object in life. The rich 
man's table is luxuriously spread; no amount of money is 
spared in procuring the rarest delicacies of the season. Art 
and Nature alike contribute to his necessities. The less 
wealthy have, indeed, fewer resources, yet these may be greatly 
increased by the knowledge of what may be called trifling 
details and refinement in the art of cookery, which depend 
much more on the manner of doing a thing than on the cost 
attending it. To cook well, therefore, is immensely more 
important to the middle and working classes than to the rich, 
for they who live by the " sweat of their brow," whether mentally 
orphysically, must have the requisite strength to support their 
labor. Even to the poor, whose very life depends upon the 
produce of the hard earned dollar, cookery is of the greatest 
importance. Every wife, mother, or sister should be a good 
plain cook. If she has servants she can direct the/ \ and if 
not, so much the more must depend upon herself To such 
we venture to give a few general hints. An old saying (to be 
found in one of the earliest cookery books) : " First catch your 
hare, etc.," has more significance than is generally supposed. 
To catch your hare well, you must spend your income judi- 
ciously. This is the chief thing. In our artificial state o

society, every income, to keep up appearances, has at least 
half as much more to do than it can afford. In the selection 
of provisions, the i^es/ is generally the cheapest. Half a pound 
of good meat is more nutritious than three times the amount 
of inferior. As to vegetables buy them fresh. Above all, where 
an income is small and there are many to feed, be careful that 
all the nourishment is retained in the food that is purchased. 
This is to be effected by careful cooking. Cleanliness is an 
imperative condition. Let all cooking utensils be clean and in 
order. Uncleanliness produces disorder, and disorder con- 
fusion. Time and money are thus wasted, dinner spoiled, and 
all goes wrong. In the cooking of meat by any process what- 
ever, remember, above all, to cook the juices in it, not out oi 
it. 

BOILING. 

In boiling put the Kieat, if fresh, into cold water, or, if salt, 
into luke-warm. Simmer it very gently until done. It is a 
general rule to allow a quarter of an hour to every pound of 
meat: but in this, as in everything else, judgment must be 
used according to the bone and shape of the joint, and accord- 
ing to the taste of the eaters. All kinds of meat, fish, flesh and 
and fowl, should be boiled very slowly, and the scum taken off 
just as boiling commences. If meats are allowed to boil too fast 
they toughen, all their juices are extracted, and only the fleshy 
fibre, without sweetness, is left ; if they boil too long they are 
reduced to a jelly, and their nourishing properties are trans- 
ferred to the water in which they are boiled. Nothing is more 
diflicult than to boil meat exactly as it should be ; close atten- 
tion and good judgment are indispensable. 

ROASTING. 

In roasting meat the gravy may be retained in it by pricking 
the jouit all over with a fork and rubbing in pepper and salt.' 
Mutton and beef n^ay he underdone, veal and pork must be

Introductory Observations. 



well cooked. Young meat generally requires more cooking 
than old ; thus lamb and veal must be more done than mutton 
and beef. In frosty weather meat will require a little more time 
for cooking. All joints for roasting will improve by hanging a 
day or so before cooking. 

BROILING. 

Broiling is the most nutritious method of cooking mutton 
and pork chops, or beef ard rump steaks, kidneys (which 
should never be cut open before cooking), etc. Have the 
gridiron clean, and put over a clear fire ; put the meat on it ; 
'•keep it turned often." This last is a common direction in 
books, but the reason why is never stated ; it is to keep the 
gravy in the meat. By letting the one side of a steak be well 
done before turning, you will see the red gravy settled on the 
top of the steak, and so the meat is hard and spoiled. This is 
cooking the gravy out of, instead of keeping it in, the meat to 
nourish the consumer. Ne\ stick the fork in the meaty 
part ; you will lose gravy if you do. Be sure to turn often, and 
generally the chop or steak is done if it feels firm to the fork ; 
if not done it will be soft and flabby. It is economical to 
broil well. Many a very little piece of meat, nicely broiled, 
with gravy in it, well seasoned with pepper and salt, a very 
little butter on it, and served up quite hot, will make a better 
and more nourishing meal than four times the amount of 
badly cooked in the frying pan. 

FRYING. 

Although very bad for chops or steaks, the frying pan is 
indispensable for some things, such as veal cutlets, lamb chops 
(sometimes), fish, pancakes, etc. Most meats and fish are 
usually fried with egg and bread crumbs. The frying pan 
must be kent clean This is verv essentiaU as the dirt that 
sticks to the pan absorbs the fat, prevents the meat browning, 
and turns it a nasty l)lack color. Have a clear brisk fire, as

the quicker meat is fried the tenderer it is. According to what 
is to be fried, put little or much fat in the pan, fish and pan- 
cakes require a considerable quantity. The fat must always 
doi/ before putting the meat into it ; if not it coddles. For 
veal cutlets a little butter is best and most economical, as it 
helps to mahe the gravy ; but even this expense may be 
dispensed with, if incompatible with the income of the family, 
and yet the cutlets be well cooked. Most have a few slices of 
bacon with either cutlets or liver ; the fat from this, if the bacon 
be not rank, will do very nicely ; and if the meat be well 
flavored and fried quickly, and some nice gravy made to it, few 
persons would know the difference. Some like thickened and 
some plain gravy to these fried meats ; some a large quantity, 
others very little ; all these must be accommodated. To make 
these gravies, have ready a little burnt sugar to brown with ; 
empty the pan of the fat, if it be, as is most likely, too rank to 
use ; put some warm water, as much as you wish to make, in 
the pan ; mix very smoothly sufficient flour and water to 
thicken it to taste ; into this put as much butter as you like to 
use (a little will do, and more will make it richer) ; pepper and 
salt it sufficiently ; stir it very smoothly into the pan, while the 
water is only warm ; stir it well until it boils, and brown it with 
the burnt sugar to your taste. This will be a cheap and very 
nice gravy for all fried meats ; and where meat is short, chil- 
dren are very fond of such over potatoes, haricot beans, or 
even bread in their plates ; and not being too rich or greasy it 
will not disagree with them. Care must be taken after the 
gravy is boiled not to let it boil fast for any length of time, as 
all thickened gravies, hashes, etc., boil away very fast and dry 
up ; neither must it stand still in the pan ; a whitish scum then 
settles on the top and spoils the appearance of it. On the 
plainest and humblest table, dishes may as well look inviting. 
N. B.— For all frying purposes be particular that the pan is 
thoroughly hot before using.

mutton, 4 or 5 carrots, 4 or 5 turnips, 3 onions, 4 large spoonfuls of 
Scotch barley, salt to taste, some chopped parsley. 

Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour ; cut off the 
scrag, and put it into a stew-pot with two quarts of woter. As 
soon as it boils skim it well and then simmer it an hoar an a 
half; then take the best end of the muiton, cut it into pieces 
(two' bones in each), take some of the fat off, and put as many 
as you think proper ; skim the moment the fresh meat boils up, 
and every quarter of an hour afterwards. Have ready four or 
five carrots, the same number of turnips, and three onions, all 
cut, but not small, and put them in soon enough to get quite 
tender ; add four farge spoonfuls of Scotch barley, first wetted 
with cold water. The meat should stew three hours. Salt to

Take the liquor that the turkey is boiled in, and the bones 
of the turkey and beef; put them into a soup-pot with two or 
three carrots, turnips and onions, half a dozen cloves, pepper,salt, 
and tomatoes, if you have any; boil it four hours, then strain all 
out. Put the soup back into the pot, mix two tablespoonfuls 
of flour into a little cold water ; stir it into the soup ; give it 
one boil. Cut some bread dice form, lay it in the bottom of 
the tureen, pour the soup on to it, and color with a little soy.

to taste. Then take flour, whicli mix with cold water to the 
consistency of cream and add to the soup while boiling. Care 
must be taken not to make it too thick. Then pare and cut 
into small pieces six or eight potatoes, which add about half 
an hour before lacing served ; and about ten minutes before 
sending to table put in a few dumplings. As veal makes a 
white soup, the color is much improved by adding a table- 
spoonful of burnt sugar. This soup may be thickened with 
rice, if preferable. 

10. French Soup -Ingreilients— i sheep's head, 3 qts. of water, 

I bunch of sweet herbs, I teacupful of pearl barley, 6 onions, i

before. Put it into a saucepan with three quarts of water, one 
teacupful of pearl barley, six onions, one turnip, one carrot, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and a few cloves. Let it simmer gently 
for about five hours, then remove the head ; strain and rub the 
vegetables through a sieve, or leave them whole, according to 
taste ; Let it stand all night, and when cold take off every par- 
ticle of fat ; cut up the meat from the head into small pieces 
and warm it up in the soup. Season to taste, add a little mush- 
room ketchup, and thicken with butter and flour. This will 
be found very little inferior to mock turtle soup. 

11. Greek Soup — Ingredients — 4 lbs. of lean beef, i lb. of lean mut- 

ton, I lb of veal, 4 ozs. of lean ham, 4 carrots, 4 onions, i head of 
celery, a little soy, a few allspice and a few coriander seeds, some 
pepper and salt, 10 qts. of water.

scum, add a little cold water, and take off the second scum ; 
then cut up the carrots, onions and celery and throw in the 
pot ; add a little more salt, a few allspice and coriander seeds ; 
let it simmer six hours, color the soup with a little soy, and 
strain it through a fine cloth ; take off any fat that may be on 
the soup with a sheet of paper ; before sending to table boil

no means generally admired. Send to table with carefully

improvement. 

IS- Oyster Soup A La Reine— Ingredients— 2 or 3 doz, small 
oysters, some pale veal stock, 2 qts. of stock, mace, cayenne, I pt. 
boiling cream. 

Two or three dozen small oysters to each pint of soup 
should be prepared. 'J ake the beards and simmer them sepa- 
rately in a little very pale veal stock thirty minutes. Heat two 
quarts of the stock, flavor with mace and cayenne, and add the 
stramed stock from the oyster beards. Simmer the fish in 
their own liquor, add to it the soup and one pint of boiling 
cream. Put the oysters in a tureen, pour over the soup, and 
serve. If not thick enough thicken with arrowroot or butter 
mixed with flour. 

16. Chicken Soup (Brown)— Ingredients— i or 2 fowls, a bunch of 

herbs, I carrot, i onion, 2 oz. of lean ham, 2 oz. of butter, pepper 
and salt, 2 qts. of good stock, and a little roux, a few allspice, a 
little grated nutmeg and mace. 

Cut up the carrot and onion, and fry in two ounces of good 
butter a nice light '.^rown, add the ham and fowl cut up small, 
taking care to break up the bones with a chopper, add the stock 
and boil until the fowl is cooked to rags ; thicken with a little 
roux, add the allspice and mace and a little grated nutmeg, color 
with a little soy, add seasoning to taste. Serve with the soup 
some plain boiled rice. 

17. Beef Gravy Soup-Ingredients-Some beef water, 2 oz. of salt 

o every gal. of water, 4 turnips, 2 carrots, some celery, 4 young

Various parts of beef are used for this ; if the meat, after the 
soup IS made, is to be sent to the table, rump steak or the best 
parts of the leg are generally used, but if soup alone is wanted, 
part of the shin with a pound from the neck will do very well. 
1 our cold water on the beef in the soup pot and heat the soup 
slowly, the slower the better, letting it simmer beside the fire 
strain it carefully, adding a little cold water now and then, put in 
two ounces of salt for every gallon of water, skim again, and put 
in tour turnips, two carrots, some celery, four young leeks, six 
Cloves stuck into an onion, half a teaspoonful of peppercorns.

Rice-Flour Soup-Ingredients-A little cold broth, 8 oz. of fine 
Tfce.fluu? 2 q,s. of fastS^oilinu broth, mace, cayenne and salt, 
2 dessertspoonfuls of currie powder, juice of ;^ a lemon. 

Mix to a smooth batter, with a little cold broth, eight oz. of 
fine rice-flour, and pour it into a couple of quarts of fast boiling 
broth or gravy soup. Add to it a seasoning of mace and cay- 
enne witl I little salt if needful. It will require but ten 
minutes boiling. Two dessertspoontuls of currie powder, and 
the strained juice of half a moderate sized lemon, will greatly 
improve this soup ; it may also be converted into a good com- 
mon white soup (If it be made of real stock) by the addition of 
three quarters of a pt. of thick cream to the rice. 
19 Milk Soup With Vermicelli -Insidients-Salt, 5 pts. of 

boiling milk, 5 oz. of fresh vermicelli. . u -v 

Throw a small quantity of salt into five pints of boiling 
milk, and then drop lightly into it five ounces of good fresh ver- 
micelli ; keep the milk stirred as this is added to prevent is 
gathering into lumps, and continue to stir it very frequently 
from fifteen to twenty minntes, or until it is perfectly tender. 
Tne addition of a little pounded sugar and powdered cinnamon 
makes this a very palatable dish. For soup of this description, 
rice, semolina, sago, cocoa-nut, sago and macaroni, may all 
be used, but they will be required in rather smaller proportions 
to the milk. 

20 Green Pea 8oup-Ingredients-4 lbs. of beef. >^ pk. of green 
pea;, I gal. of water, Yz cup of rice-flour, salt, pepper and chopped

Four pounds beef, cut into small pieces, half a peck of green 
peas, one gallon water, half a cup of rice-flour, salt, pepper and 
chopped parsley ; boil the empty pods of the peas in the vjater 
one hour before putting in the beef. Strain them out, add the 
beef and boil slowly for an hour and a half longer. Halt an 
houi^ before serving, add the shelled peas, and twenty minutes 
later, the rice-flour, with salt, pepper and parsley. After adding 
the rice-flour, stir frequently, to prevent scorching, btrain into 
a hot tureen.

' 1 water Ahc S[>aniarcls use a pipkin, called in the 

v< ._ : a " mam. !('/), one pound and a half of "garbanzos," 
or chick '»eas, one good slice of lean raw ham, and any de fin's 
(no matter lUW siiuill) of game or poultry. Cook gently with 
the hd on, skim, and add a litik- ba on cut small, and as much 
salt as necessary ; cook for anoUicr hall" hour, then pour off the 
br(/th slowly, to \n used afterwards for the soup and sauce; 
add as much vegetahii; as yr-i please, thoroughly well washed, 
tMii' rook over a clear fire uiilil 'otic. About five minutes be- 
fore t, e 011a is ready, it is de //ipteur in Madrid kitchens to 
throw in a pii'ce of " chorizo " (black pudding). Serve the 
meat separately on one dish, the vegetables on another, and in 
a third the sauce for the whole, either of the following being 
appropriate. 

TOMATO. — Cook three or four juicy tomatoes until 
quite tender, and pass them through a sieve. Add some of 
the broth, some vinegar and salt, to the puree. 

PARSLEY. — Pound some young parsley and bread crumbs 
in a mortar. Moisten with the broth, add vinegar and salt to 
taste. 

These sauces should properly be served in a small silver or 
china bowl, surrounded by vegetables. For the tomato, spring 
and summer vegetables, and for the parsley sauce, those of 
autumn and winter are customarily used, with the rigorous 
exclusion, in both cases, of cabbage. 

A Cocido compounded of the above ingredients, without the 
auxiliary black pudding or vegetables, the Spaniards call a 
•• Puchero," de los enfermas.

The second soup, Ajo bianco, or white garlic soup, is more 
intricate in its manufacture, though compounded of as quaint 
and unlikely materials. It is extensively eaten in Andalusia. 
To be completely veracious, I must of necessity commence 
with that formidable brother to our harmless, necessary little 
onion — big garlic. Pound one clove of garlic and P'^ven well 
dried beans, or better still, almonds in a small spice iue. tar to 
a smooth paste. Moisten this paste with olive oil, drop by 
drop, then water by degrees, so as to thoroughly .i.c^iporate 
and amalgamate the whole. Add until it is sufficiently wet to

Boil half a pt. of pearl barley in a qt. of white stock till it is 
reduced to a pulp, pass it through a hair sieve, and add to it 
as much well flavored white stock as will give a puree of the 
consistency of cream ; put the soup on the fire, when it boils 
stir into it, off the fire, the yolk of an egg beaten up with a gill 
of crcar.i ; add half a pat of fresh butter, and serve with small 
dice of bread fried in butter. 

31. Lobster Soup (Bisque) — ingredients— l lobster, butter, 

pepper, sail and grated nutmeg, bread crumbs, stock, i tablespoon- 
ful of flour, bread. 
Pick out all the meat from a lobster, pound it in a mortar 
with an equal quantity of butter until a fine orange-coU red 
pulp is obtained ; to this add pepper, salt and grated nutmeg 
to taste. I'ake as much bread crumhs as there is lobster pi.ip, 
soak them in stock, then melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, 
amalgamate with it a heaped tablespoonful of flour ; mix the 
lobster pulp with the bread crumbs, and put them into the 
saucepan with the butter and flour, stir well and add more 
stock until a puree is obtained, rather thinner in consistency 
than the soup should be. Put the saucei)an on the fire, stirring 
the contents until they thicken and boil ; draw it then on one 
side, and carefully skim off superfluous fat, then strain the 
soup through a hair sieve, make it boiling hot, and serve with 
small dice of bread fried in butter.

limbs of any roast poultry — ducks, fowls, pigeons, geese, turkey 
or game, and the fresh livers, gizzards, necks, and combs of 
any poultry you hajipen to be going to cook the same day, and 
a slice of lean ham if you have it. Put all these together in an 
earthen soup pan that will stand the fire and will hold one- 
third more cold water than you require for your soup to allow 
for the loss in boiling ; fill with water, and place on a brisk fire 
till it boils. Then add salt (less quantity if there be ham in 
the soup), one large onion, one large turnip, one large leek, 
one head of celery, four large carrots, three sliced tomatoes, a 
quarter of a bay leaf, three or four cloves stuck into a carrot or 
turnip, six whole peppercorns, three allspice whole, and, finally, 
a good-sized bunch of parsley and chervil tied together. We 
find a piece of calfs liver and a fresh young cabbage an im- 
provement, but this is a matter of taste. When boiling skim 
thoroughly, and take the pot off the fire, placing it quite at the 
edge so as merely to simmer gently — or, as the French call it, to 
smiVe — for six hours at least. The great art in making this 
sort of simple broth is never to let the fire go down too much, 
nor to allow the soup to boil too fast, so as not to require 
filling up with other water to replace what has been consumed 
— or, rather, wasted by rapid ebullition. Half an hour before 
you require your soup take it off tho fire and strain through a 
cullender, then through a fine sieve, and j ut it on a brisk fire. 
When quite boiling add tapioca, sago, vermicelli, or semolina, 
scattering it lightly, and allowing one tablespoonful to each 
person. Rice may also be used, but it requires a full half hour, 
and consumes Tiore broth. We use this broth as a foundation 
to every kind of vegetable purees. 

33. Oxtail Soup (Clear).— Ingredients— I oxtail, 4 carrots, 4 onions, 
2 turnips, i l)unch of herbs, little allspice, i head of celery, 2 qts. of 
good stock, a little soy, pepper, salt, }i lb. of lean beef. 

Cut up the oxtail into small pieces, well blanch them in salt 
and water, boil them in water, throw into cold wr.ter. Cut up 
the vegetables into small pieces (taking care to save some of 
the best pieces for boiling to go in the soup to table), throw 
them into a stewpan with the herbs, allspice, soy, pepper and 
salt, put the oxtail on the top, cover with the gravy, and cook 
until the tail is quite tender. When cooked, take out the tail, 
and cut up half a pound of lean beef quite fine and throw in 
the gravy, let it boil a few minutes, and strain through a cloth,

OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH. 

If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very 
nicely done, but those in great towns wash it beyond what is 
necessary for cleaning, and so by much washing diminish the 
flavor. If to be boiled, some salt and a little vinegar should 
be put in the water to give firmness ; but cod, whiting, and 
haddock are far better if salted and kept a day ; and if not very 
hot weather they will be better kept two days. Those who 
know how to purchase fish may, by taking more than they want 
for one day, often get it cheaper ; and such kinds as will pot 
or pickle, or keep by being sprinkled with salt, and hung up, 
or being fried will serve for stewing the next day, may then be 
bought with advantage. Fresh water fish have often a muddy 
smell and taste, to take off which soak it in strong salt and 
water after it is nicely cleaned, then dry and dress it. The fish 
must be put in the water while cold and set to do very gently, 
or the outside will break before the inner part is done. Crimp 
fish should be put into boiling water, and when it boils up put 
a little cold water in, to check extreme heat, and simmer it a 
few minutes. Small fish nicely fried, covered with egg and 
crumbs, make a dish far more elegant than if served plain. 
Great attention should be paid to the garnishing of fish, use 
plenty of horse-radish, parsley and lemon. If fish is to be 
fried or broiled it must be wrapped in a clean cloth after it is 
well cleaned. When perfectly dry, wet with an egg (if for fry- 
ing) and sprinkle the finest bread crumbs over it, then, with a 
large quantity of lard or dripping boiling hot, plunge the fish

lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it immediately 
from the water and instantly it will be green and crisp, and 
must be taken up with a slice. If fish is to be broiled, it must 
be seasoned, flavored and put on a gridiron that is very clean, 
which when hot should be rubbed with a piece of suet to pre- 
vent the fish from sticking. It nmst be broiled on a very clear 
fire and not too near or it may be scorched. 



39. Cod's Head and Shoulders (to boil)— Ingredients— i 

cod's head and shoulders, salt water, i glass of vinegar, horse-radish. 
Wash and tie it up, and dry with a cloth. Salt the water, 
and put in a glass of vinegar. When boiling, take off the scum; 
put the fish in, and keep it boiling very briskly about half an 
hour. Parboil the milt and roe. cut in thin slices, fry, and 
serve them. Garnish with horse-radish; for sauce, oysters, 
eggs, or drawn butter. 

40. Cod's Head and Shoulders— Ingredients— i bunch parsley, 

I leiuon.. horse-radish, milt, roe and liver. 

Tie it up, and put on the fire in cold water which will com- 
pletely cover it ; throw a handful of salt into it. Great care 
must be taken to serve it without the smallest speck of black 
or scum. Garnish with a large quantity of double parsley, 
lemon, horse-radish, and the milt, roe and liver, and fried 
smelts if approved. If with smelts, be careful that no water 
hangs about the fish ; or the beauty of the smelts will be taken 
off, as well as their flavor. Serve with plenty of oyster or 
shrimp sauce, and anchovy and butter. It will eat much finer 
by having a little salt rubbed down the bone, and along the 
thick part, even if to be eaten the same day. 

Though it is important to buy fresh codfish, it is not quite 
so well to cook it immediately, as, when freshly caught, it is apt 
to be watery ; but when rubbed with salt and kept a day or 
two, it acquires the firmness and creaminess so much prized. 
Cod is better crimped than when cooked whole, the operation 
of boiling being more successfully performed under these con- 
ditions. The fish may be partially crimped by scoring it at 
equal distances, without absolutely cutting it through into 
slices ; but the effect of the operation is always to improve the 
fish. When thoroughly cleaned the cod should be scored or 
sliced at regular intervals of about one and a half or two inches, 
then washed clean in spring-water, and laid in a pan of spring-

water in which a handful of salt has been allowed to dissolve. 
After about two hours' soaking in this brine, the fish may be 
washed and set to drain. Some people boil the cod whole; 
but a large head and shoulders contain all the fish that is pro- 
ner to help, the thinner parts being overdone and tasteless, 
before the thick are ready. But the whole fish may be pur-^ 
chased at times more reasonably; and the lower halt, u 
sprinkled and hung up, will be in high perfection in one or two 
days. Or it may be made saltcr, and served with egg-sauce, 
potatoes and parsnips. 

41. Salt Cod-Ingredients-Cod, vinegar (1 glass), parsnips, cream, 
butter, flour. 
Soak and clean the piece you mean to dress, then lay it all 
night in water, with a glass of vinegar. Boil it enough, then 
break it into flakes on the dish ; pour over it parsnips boiled, 
beaten in a mortar, and then boiled up with cream and a large 
piece of butter rubbed with a little flour. It may ^e served 
as above with egg sauce instead of the parsnip, and the rtst 
sent up whole ; or the fish may be boiled and sent up without 
flaking, and sauces as above. 

A2 Curry of Cod-Ingredients-Salt and cayenne, cod, onior«, 
^ whi^ g°vy curry powder, butter, flour, 3 or 4 spoonfuis of crean.^

onion; and stew it with a good white gravy, a little curry 
powder, a r'ece of butter and flour, three or four spoonfuls of 
rich cream, salt, and cayenne, if the powder be not hot enough.

water; and when tender, drain it, put it in a stone pan, sprin- 
kle some cayenne, whole allspice, a few cloves, and a little 
mace over each piece ; cover with cold vinegar. This makes a 
nice relish for tea. 

48. Salmon (to Broil)-Ingredients-Salmon, pepper, salt. 

Cut slices an inch thick, and season with pepper and salt • 
lay each slice in half a sheet of white paper well buttered, twist 
the ends of the paper, and broil the slices over a slow fire six

ounces of coarse sugar; rub these, when mixed well, into the 
salmon, and lay it on a large dish or tray two days, then 
rub it well with common salt, and in twenty four hours more 
it will be fit to dry ; wipe it well after draining. Hang it either 
in a wood chimney or in a dry place ; keeping it open with 
two small sticks. Dried salmon is eaten broiled in paper, 
and only just warmed through; egg sauce and mashed pota- 
toes with it ; or it may be boiled, especially the piece next the 
head.

whole on the bottom of a sieve; and with a fork lay the pieces 
into potling-pots, some of each sort, with the seasoning about 
it. When cold pour clarified butter over, but not hot. It will 
be good next day ; or if highly seasoned, and thickly covered 
with butter, will keep some time. Potted lobster may be used 
cold, or as a fricassee, with cream sauce ; and then it looks

salt and cayenne pepper upon them, and broil upon one of the 
small gridirons sold for that purpose. You can dredge the 
oyster with biscuit dust or flour, if you wish to have it brown ; 
and some fancy the juices are Ix'tter kept in this way ; others 
dislike the crust thus formed. Butter the gridiron well, and let 
your fire be hot and clear. If the oysters drip, withdraw the

of hot water until it boils, then stir in two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and a little salt, with white pepper. Take from the fire, 
and add two heaped tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, rice f]our, or 
corn starch, moistened with cold milk. By this time your 
shells should be washed and buttered, and a fine oyster laid 
within each. Of course, it is se/oH les ri^^ks to use oyster shells 
for this purpose ; but you will find scollop shells more roomy 
and manageable, because more regular in shape. Range these 
closely in a large baking pan, propping them with clean 
pebbles or fragments of shell, if they do not seem inclined to 
retain their contents. Stir the cream very hard, and fill up 
each shell with the mixture, taking care not to spill any in the 
pan. Bake five or six minutes in a hot oven after the shells 
become warm. Serve on the shell. Some substitute oyster 
liquor f; - the water in the mixture, and use all milk instead 
of cream.

flesh into small flakes, shell half a pint of shrimps (for two mac- 
kerel), and mix them with the fish ; simmer the shells and 
mackerel tiimmings for twenty minutes, with just sufficient 
water to cover them. Strain the liquid into a fresh saucepan, 
and add to it enough now milk to make your quantity of sauce. 
Thicken this to the consistency of thick cream with corn flour, 
and flavor it delicately with essence of anchovies, soy, walnut, 
and mushroom catchup, grated lemon peel and nutmeg, 
cayenne, white pepper, and salt if required ; stir into this suf- 
ficient lemon juice to give an agreeable acid, and mix well with 
the fish. Put this mixture into china or silver scallop shells, or 
on a flat dish, and cover thickly with fine bread crumbs; 
moisten these slightly with liquid butter and brown in a quick 
oven or before a clear fire. Scald a few capers in their own 
vinegar, and just before serving the scallop drain and sprinkle 
them over. The remains of any cold fish may be served like 
this with great advantage ; also tinned salmon, etc. Cod, fresh 
haddock, and soles are best flavored with oysters instead of 
shrimps. 

Si. Red Mullet (called the Sea-Woodcock). 

Clean, but leave the inside, fold in oiled paper, and gently 
bake in a small dish. Make a sauce of the liquor that comes 
from the fish, with a piece of butter, a little flour, and a little

OBSERVATIONS. 

In choosing ducks be careful to secure those with plump 
bellies and thick and yellowish feet, and to insure them being 
tender it is advisable to let them hang a day or two. 

In choosing turkeys, the hen is preferable for boiling on 
account of its whiteness and tenderness. 

Rabbits, when young, have smooth and sharp claws. 

In selecting a goose choose one with a clean, white skin, 
plump breast and yellow feet. 

To choose venison the meat should be fat, clear and bright, 
the more fat the better the meat. 

A young fowl has large soft feet and neck. 




TO CARVE FOWL. 

Fix the fork firmly in the breast, let the knife be sharply 
run along the line from i to 2, then downwards to 3, and the 
wing can be easily removed. Now place 
the fork inside the leg and gently force from 
the body, the joint can be readily seen so as 
cut through. Now draw the knife through 
the flesh in the direction of 4 to 5, slip knife 
beneath the merry-thought gently lifting and 
pressing backwards and it will come off at once. Now for collar 
or neck bones. These are on each side of the merry-thought, 
they must be raised by the knife at the broad end and turned 
from the body towards the "breastbone until the short piece of 
bonc breaks off. 

The breast, with the ribs, is now left, the former can be 
easily disengaged from the ribs by cutting through the latter.

The side bones must now be removed. Turn the lower 
end of the back from the carver, i)ress the point of the knife 
through the top of backbone, near centre, and down towards 
the end of the back, completely through the bone. The back- 
bone being now uppermost, press the fork down on it and at the 
same time, with the knife, raise up the small end of fowl towards 
the fork and the back will be dislocated in the middle. 

TO CARVS: TURKEY. 

In carving turkey, as in duck and goose, commence cutting 
slices close to the wing from 2 to 3, proceeding upwards to the 
ridge of the breast bone. The breast 
being the only part called yfw in a turkey, 
the legs are seldom cut off at table but 
appear in a form attractive to bachelors, 
we mean devilled. 

Boiled turkey is carved in the same manner. 

TO CARVE GOOSE. 

Neatly cut slices, not too thick, should be carved from the 
breast along line 2 to 3. When the first slice is cut, a hole 
should be cut in the apron, passing it 
round the line marked, here the 
stuffing will be found. A good 
carver will cut a large number of 
fine sli'wCS off the breast, especially if 
he commences close down by the 

wing, carving towards the ridge of the breastbone. Now take 
off the wings in the same way as in carving fowl- 
It may be necessary in taking off the leg to turn the goose 
on its side, then pressing down the small end of leg pass the 
knife under it from the top down to the joint, turn the leg back 
with the fork, and with the knife cut through the joint, remov- 
ing the thigh bone from its socket, disengage the merry-thought 
and all other parts the same way as in fowl. 




94. To Prepare and truss a fowl for roasting. 

Singe off all small feathers left on the bird, with a lighted 
paper, moving it quickly so as not to scorch "t. It is an error 
to depend on this singeing to take away the feathers carelessly

left in plucking. If any appear ///// them out ; if singed out 
an odor of burnt feathers will cling *to the bird. Now com- 
mence to draw. Place the bird back downwards upon the 
table, cut a small slit in the skin of the neck, draw the neck 
towards you, cutting it off at the root. Then make a small 
slit in the tail-end of the bird, and with the middle finger loosen 
the entrails, doing this carefully, that you may afterwards have 
less trouble in drawmg, Cut off vent and draw. Be careful 
not to break the gall bladder, for by so doing the bird will be 
ruined. With a clean cloth wipe out the inside, also the flap 
of skin at the neck, and should you accidently break any part, 
it is only safe to wash the inside, drying it thoroughly with a 
clean cloth. Dip the legs in boiling water, scrape them and 
cut off claws ; also the tips of pinions. It is now ready for 
trussing. Skewer the pinions by inserting the skewer through 
the first joint of the one on the right side (the middle of the leg 
being brought near to it), then through the body and through 
the pinion on the left. Fasten the skin over the neck, placing 
it over the back with a skewer. Now put a long skewer 
through the skin of the back, on the left side ; then through 
the first joint of the leg and on through the leg on right side. 
Clean and wash gizzard, put it on one of the pinions and 
the hver on the other. The bird is now ready. 

95. Fowl (Roast)— Ingredients— Butter, flour, gravy, lemon juice, 

sausages, bacon. 

Fowls require constant attention in dredging and basting, 
and the last ten minutes let butter rolled in flour be stuck over 
them in little bits, and allowed to melt without basting. The 
gravy for fowls should always be thickened, and slightly flavored 
with lemon-juice. Sausages or rolled bacon should be served 
on the same dish, and white mashed potatoes should always 
be handed with poultry. 

96. To Truss a Fowl for Boillne: 

Loosen the skin of the legs carefully, so as not to break it. 
The legs may be cut off at the knee joint, or trussed with the 
feet underneath. Skewer the pinions and legs firmly to the 
side of the bird ; the liver and gizzard are omitted, when the 
fowl is boiled. 

97. Fowl (to Boil). 

For boiling, choose those that are not black-legged. Pick

pieces three inches in diameter; put a piece of the above 
mince on each, then fold them up, fastening the edges by 
moistening them with water. Trim the rissoles neatly with a 
fluted cutter, dip each one in beaten-up egg, and fry a golden 
color in hot lard. 

102. Chicken (JgIIigcS)— Ingredients— A chicken, i oz. of butter,

106, Wild Duck (Roast)— Ingredients— Duck, bread crumbs, carrot, 
pepper and salt, sage and onions, currant jelly, i pinch of cayenne, 
browned flour. 
Before roasting, parboil with a small carrot peeled and put 
inside. This will absorb the fishy taste. If you have no 
carrot at hand, an onion will have the same effect, but unless 
you mean to use onion in the stuffing a carrot is preferable. 
When parboiled throw away the carrot or onion, lay in fresh 
water for half an hour, stuff with bread crumbs seasoned with

Clean and dress the birds, loosen the joints, but do not 
divide them, put on the stove to simmer while you prepare puff 
paste. Cover a deep dish with it, then lay in the bottom some 
shreds of i)ork or ham, then a layer of hard boiled eggs, a little 
butter and pepper. Take the bi'rds from the fire, sprinkle with 
pepper and minced parsley. Sijueeze lemon juice upon them, 
and upon the breasts of the birds a few pieces of butter rolled 
in flour. Cover with slices of egg, then shred some ham and 
lay upon this. Pour in a little of the gravy in which the quails 
were parboiled, and put on the lid. Leave a hole it the 
middle and bake a little over one hour. 

108. Quails (Roastins With Ham). 

Prepare the birds as you would grouse, but cover the ham or 
pork with a sheet of pai)er, having secured the meat with pack 
thread. Stitch the i)apers on, and keep well basted with butter 
and water. Roast three quarters of an hour. Remove papers 
from meat before dishing, and brown quickly. This is a favorite 
way of cooking (piails. 

109. Rabbit Pie— Ingredients— 2 ral)l)its, }:( lb. of fat pork, 4 eggs, 

pejiper, butter, a little powdered mace, a few drops of lemon juice, 
putf paste. 

Cut a pair of ralibits into ten pieces, soak in salt and water 
half an hour and simmer, until half done, in enough water 
to cover them. Cut a quarter of a pound of pork into slices, 
and boil four eggs hard. Lay some pieces of pork in 
the bottom of the dish, the next a layer of rabbit. Upon this 
spread slices of boiled egg and pepper and butter. Sprinkle, 
moreover, with a little powdered mace, j few drops of lemon 
juice upon each piece of meat. Proceed in this manner until 
the dish is full, the top layer being pork. Pour in water in 
which the rabbit was boiled ; when you have salted it and 
added a few lumps of butter rolled in flour, cover with puff 
paste, make a hole in the middle and bake for one hour. 
Cover with paper if it should bake too fast. 

110. Rabbit (Stewed)— Ingredients-i rabbit, salted water, dripping 

or butter, flour, 6 onions, Ji' pt. water. 

Cut a rabbit in pieces, wash it in cold water, a little salted. 
Prepare in a stewpan some flour, and clarified dripping or 
butter ; stir it until it browns. Then put in the pieces of 
rabbit and keep stirring and turning, until they are tinged with

a little color ; then add six onions, peeled, but not cut up, and 
half a pint of water. Serve all together in a deep dish. 

111. A Gerinan Dish— Ingredients— A tender fowl, salt, pepper, 

niacf, flour, yolk uf I egg, hot lard, liver, gizzard, parsley. 

Quarter a tender fowl, season the pieces with pepper and 
salt and mace ; flour, and then dip them in the beaten up yolk 
of an egg ; fry a golden color in hot lard ; dish them, garnished 
with the liver and gizzard fried separately, and with fried pars- 
ley. Serve either with a salad garnished with hard-boiled eggs 
or tomato sauce. 

112. Giblets (to Stew)— Ingredients— Salt and pepper, butter, I cup 

of cream, i tcaspoonful of Hour. 

Do them as directed for giblet-pie (under the head pies) ; 
season them with salt and pepper, and a very small piece of 
mace. Before serving give them one boil with a cup of cream, 
and a piece of butter rubbed in a teaspoonful of flour, 

113. Pigeons. 

May be dressed in so many ways, that they are very useful. 
The good flavor of them depends very much on their being 
cropped and drawn as soon as killed. No other biid requires 
so much washing. Pigeons left from dinner the day before 
may be stewed or made into a pie ; in either case care must be 
taken not to overdo them, which will make them stringy. 
They need only be heated up in gravy, made ready, and force- 
meat balls may be fried and added, instead of putting a stuffing 
into them. If for a pie, let beef-steaks be stewed in a little 
water, and put cold under them, and cover each pigeon with a 
piece of fat bacon, to keep them moist. Season as usual. 

114. Pigeons (to Boil). 

After cleaning, split the backs, pepper and salt them, and 
broil them nicely ; pour over them either stewed or pickled 
mushrooms in melted butter, and serve as hot as possible. 

115. Pigeons Roast. 

Should be stuffed with parsley, either cut or whole ; and 
seasoned within. Serve with parsley and butter. Peas or 
asparagus should be dressed to eat with them.

hang the Ijird on a hook in the wall, thi." liook passing through 
the break you liavti just made. (It is i)est to have the hook 
above you). Now, with all your strength, draw the sinews. 
This i.s a necessity, or the legs will be uneatable. This done, 
chof) off tiie legs, cut off the neck near the back, just leaving 
enough skin to turn over it. Retnove the crop, loosen liver, 
etc., at the neck end. Now cut off vent, remove gut and care- 
fully draw. Wash and dry with a clean cloth, cut the breast- 
bone through at botli sides, close to the l)ack, and llatten it 
with the rolling [)in. Firmly skewer the pinion at right side 
through the bird until you reach the other. J'ress the legs 
close to the body, skewering at first and .second joints. Pro- 
ceed to stuff, skewer over flap of skin, also that at neck. It is 
now ready for cooking. 

117. Turkey (Roast). 

Having prejjarcd the bird for dressing, stuff with plain 
forcemeat, pack it up in thin slices of fat bacon, and over 
this a sheet of buttered paper, put in oven, basting frequently 
with butter. A quarter of an hour before it is done remove 
paper and bacon. Sprinkle with a little fine salt just before 
serving. Garnish with pork sausages and serve with a tureen 
of gravy. Time for roasting, from two to three hours, accord- 
ing to size. 

118. Forcemeat for Turkey. 

Take one part of finely shred suet, and two paits of 
bread crumbs, season with pepper, salt and powdered spices, 
sweet herbs, and finely minced parsley ; mix all well together, 
then add as many eggs as will bind the mi.xture into a stiff 
paste. 

119. Gravy for Turkey. 

Mince an onion finely, fry it in )utter to a dark brown, add 
three-quarters of a pint of good stock, pepper and salt to taste, 
a small piece of finely minced ham, a sprig of thyme, and 
parsley, and a little Worcester sauce. Let the whole boil five 
or ten minutes, stand on one side till needed, then strain into 
saucoboat.

boil in salted water wiili a handful of coriander seeds and a 
cuuple of bay leaves. When thoroughly done, remove the outer 
skin and pound the chestnuts in a mortar, adding a little stock

OBSERVATIONS ON MEAT. 

In purchasing beef secure meat of a deep red color, with 
the fat mingled with the lean, giving it a mottled appearance. 
The fat will be firm and the color resembling grass butter. 
The smaller the b^eed, so much sweeter the meat. It will be 
l)etter for eating if kept a few days. Veal, lamb and pork 
(being white meat), will not keep more than a day or two. 

Beef— For roasting, the sirloin and rib pieces are the 
best. The chief object is to prevent the escape of the 
juices ; it is a very good plan to throw a cup of boi'/in^ water 
over the meat when first put in the oven. This will prevent 
the escape of the juices for a while, and will thoroughly 
warm through the meat. 

Mutton— Choose this by the fineness of its grain, 
good color, and firm white fat. It is not the better for 
being young ; if of a good breed and well fed, it is better for 
age ; but this only holds with wether-mutton ; the flesh of the 
ewe is paler, and the texture finer. Ram-mutton is very strongly 
flavored ; the flesh is of a deep red, and the fat is spongy. 

Lamb -Observe the neck of a fore-quarter; if the vein 
is bluish it is fresh ; if it has a green or yellow caste it is stale. 
In the hind-quarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, 
and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes are 
sunken the head is not fresh. Grass-lamb comes in season in 
April or May, and continues till August. House-lamb may be 
had in great towns almost all the year, but is in highest perfec- 
tion in December and January. 

Pork— Pinch the lean and if young it will break. If the 
rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be impressed by the 
finger, it is old. A thin rind is a merit in all pork. When 
fresh 'the flesh will be smooth and cool ; if clammy it is tainted.

What is called measley pork is very unwholesome, and may be 
known by the fat being full of kernels, which in good pork is 
never the case. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer for 
curing any way, the fat being spongy. Dairy-fed pork is the 
best. A sucking pig, to be eaten in perfection, should not be 
more than three weeks old, and should be dressed the same 
day it is killed. 

Veal— Veal should be perfectly white; if purchasing 
the loin, the fat enveloping the kidney should be white and 
firm. Veal will not keep so long as an older meat, especially 
in hot or wet weather. Choose small and fat veal. It is in 
season from March to August. 

Tripje— This requires to be well cooked and nicely 
served, and then it is both light and nutritious, and can often 
be eaten by invalids, or persons having a delicate digestion. 
Choose a nice white piece ; wash it well, and put into a stew- 
pan with sufficient milk and water in equal parts to cover it ; 
let it simmer gently for about half an hour after it has boiled 
up. Serve with white sauce, omitting the parsley, and garnish 
the dish with slices of beet-root. Onion sauce may be sub- 
stituted if preferred, or it may be served with a little of the 
liquor in which it has been cooked poured over it, and some 
plainly boiled Spanish onions handed round in a vegetable 
dish. 

CARVING BEEF. 

128. Brisket of Beef. 

Cut neatly, across lines as shown 
here 

129. Ribs. 

The manner of carving is as follows : 
cut in direction of dotted line from i

130. Sirloin. 

The upper part of this joint should 
be cut along line from 5 to 6. Should 
you prefer ii you may cut across from 3 
to 4, but we do not advise this plan. 
The joint may be raised and slices cut 
from the under sidealonglinefrom i to 2.

137. Fillets of Beef (a la Ohateaubrlaod)— Ingredients— 

A piece of sirloin of beef, pepper, salt, oil.

into slices one and one half inches thick, sprinkle them with 
pepper, dip them in oil, and broil over a clear fire, sprmkle 
with salt, and serve very hot in a dish garnished with potatoes 
sciutces an beurn. 

138. RoastSlrloin—Ingredientc— Beef, flour, salt and cup of water.

another hour. Serve with horse radish. 

139. Roast Beef and Brown gi-avy— Ingredients— Beef, pepper, 
salt, 2 lablespoonfuls of flour, onion, bay leaf. 

It is not everyone who, in preparing roast beef, manages to 
have the gravy quite right. It is either fat, thick, or too pale. 
Table Talk gives the following directions : First of all, the 
meat must be properly roasted or rather baked. Wipe the fat 
side with a damp cloth, put it in the pan, dust with pepper, 
put a teaspoonful of salt in the corner of the pan, add a half 
cup of hot water, and put it at once into a very hot oven. 
Bake fifteen minutes to every pound, have the oven very hot 
for the first half hour, and slightly cooler towards the last. Do 
not add any more water, but baste the meat every ten minutes 
with the fat that mehs from tlie meat and falls to the bottom 
of the pan. When the meat is done remove it from tlie pan ; 
pour off all the fat but about two tablespoonfuls, being very 
careful to retain all the osmazone, the brown substance in the 
bottom of the pan. Add to the pan two rounding tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, stir over the fire until the flour is a dark brown 
without scorching. Add quickly, all at once, one and a half 
cups (three gills) of warm water, stir continually until boihng, 
taste to see if salt enough ; if not, season, add a slice of onion, 
a b^v leaf, and simmer gently two minutes. Strain through a 
gravy strainer and serve. If the directions are carefully followed, 
the gravy will be a nut brown, and entirely free from grease.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS RESPECTING CRAVIES. 

Gravy may be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, and 
the kidneys, as of any other meat, prepared in the same way. 

An ox-kidney, or milt, makes good gravy, cut all to pieces, 
and prepared as other meat ; and so will the shank end ol 
mutton that has been dressed, if much be not wanted. 

The shank-bones of mutton are a great improvement to tne 
richness of gravy ; but first soak them well, and scour them 

^ ^^Tarragon gives the flavor of French cookery, and in high 
gravies is a great improvement ; but it should be added only a 
short time before serving.

OBSERVA'f lOxNS ON SAUCES. 

The appearance and preparation of sauces are of the 
highest importance. Brown sauces should not he as thick as 
white ones, and both should possess a decided character, so 
that whether sweet or sharp, plain or savory, they would bear 
out their names. Care is also to be taken that they blend and 
harmonize with the various dishes they are to accompany. 



226. White Sauce— Ingredients— I pt. of milk, 2 or 3 mushrooms, I 

onion, i carrot, i bundle of sweet herbs, whole pepper and salt to

whole pepper and salt to taste, a few cloves, and a little mace; 
let the whole gently simmer for about an hour, put an ounce 
of butter into the saucepan, and stir on the fire until it thickens.

254. Common Stock, 

Take all the bones of joints, etc., that are available, car- 
cases and bones of poultry and game (not high), chop them all 
into convenient pieces and put them into a saucepan together 
with any scraps of meat, cooked or uncooked, resulting from 
remnants, the trimmings of cutlets, etc. Add a couple of car- 
rots, one onion, a bunch of parsley, one bay leaf, a small sprig 
of thyme, and one of marjoram ; sal*- to taste, a small quantity 
of white pepper and allspice mixed, and two or three cloves. 
Fill the saucepan with cold water until it covers the contents 
by one inch, and set it on the fire to boil slowly for about four 
hours ; strain the liquor through a cloth into a basin, and when 
cold, the cake of fat on the top being removed, the stock will 
be fit for use. 

255. Gravy Stock. 

Place a layer of sixes of onion in a saucepan holding a 
gallon, over this a layer of fat bacon, and over all about two 
pounds of shin of beef chopped in small pieces ; one pint of 
common stock or even water, being poured on the whole, set 
the saucepan on the fire for one hour, until the liquor is almost 
evaporated— what is called reduced to a "glaze" — then add 
sufficient cold common stock or cold watc- to cover contents 
of the saucepan, and two or three carrots cut in slices, one 
leek, a head of celery (when in season), or some celery seed, a 
handful of parsley, half a clove of garlic, a sprig of marjoram 
and of thyme, a bay leaf, four or five cloves, white pepper and 
salt to taste. After boiling for about three hours strain off the 
liquor, and, being absolutely freed from fat, it is ready for use. 

256. Veal Stock. 

Toss a couple of onions, sliced, and one pound of lean veal 
cut in pieces in a saucepan with some butter until they assume 
a light color, then add half a pound of ham chopped up small,

ders, small eels, or the trimmings of almost any fish that have 
been filleted ; pack them into a saucepan, with a head of parsley,

OBSERVATIONS. 

Take care to purchase them perfectly fresh, as this is their 
chief value and excellence. The middle-sized are preferable 
to the larger or smaller ; they are more tender, juicy, and are 
better flavored. Peas and potatoes are seldom worth eating 
before midsummer. Salads, greens, roots, when first gathered 
are firm and have a fragrant freshness. 

Vegetables should be carefully cleaned from insects and 
nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of water, and drain them 
the moment tney are done enough. If overboiled, they lose 
their beauty and their crispness. Bad cooks sometimes dress 
them with meat, which is wrong, except carrots with boiline 
oeet. ^ 

To boil vegetables green, be sure the water boils when you 
put them in. Make them boil very fast. Don't cover but 
watch them ; and if the water has not slackened, you may be 
sure they are done when they begin to sink. Then take them 
out immediately or the color will change. Hard water especi- 
ally if chalybeate, spoils the color of such vegetables as should 
be green . 

To boil them green in hard water, put a teu^ iful of salt 
of wormwood into the water when it boils, before th*- vegetables 
are put in. ^ 

259 Vegetable Marrovti (to Boil or Stew). 

This excellent vegetable may be boiled as asparagus. When 
boiled, divide it lengthways into fvo, and serve it upon a toast 
accompanied by melted butler ; or when nearly boiled, divide 
It as above, and stew gently in gravy like cucumbers.' Care 
"hould be taken to choose young ones not exceeding six inches 
in length.

260. Spinach. 

Carefully wash and pick. When that is done, throw it into 
a saucepan that will just hold it, sprinkle it with a little salt, 
and cover close. The pan must be set on the fire, and well 
shaken. When done, beat the spinach well with a small piece 
of'butter ; it must come to table pretty dry, and looks well it 
pressed into a tin mould in the form of a large leaf, which is 
sold at the tinshops. A spoonful of cream is an improvement. 

261. Spinach— Ingredients— Spinach, butter, pepper and salt, boiled 

eggs. 
Wash and pick your spinach very carefully ; drop mto a 
cupful of boiling water and cook fifteen minutes. Drain thor- 
oughly through a cullender, then chop quite fine. Return to the 
stove, add one tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste ; 
put in a vegetable dish and garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 

262 Potatoes (to Broil). 

Parboil, then slice and broil them. Or parboil and then 
set them on the gridiron over a very slow fire, and when thor- 
oughly done send them up with their skins on. This last way 
is practised in many Irish families. 

263. Potatoes (to Fry). 

Take the skin off raw potatoes, slif;e and fry them, either 
in butter or thin batter. 

264. Potatoes (to Mash). 

Boil the potatoes, peel them, and break them to paste ; 
then to two pounds of them add a quarter of a pint of milk, a 
little salt, and two ounces of butter, and stir it all well over the 
fire. Either serve them in this manner, or place them on the 
dish in a form, and then brown the top with a salamander, or 

in scallops.

color, throw in slices of cold boiled potatoes, which must be 
thoroughly stirred until they are turning brown; at this moment 
put in a spoonful of finely chopped parsley, and as soon as it 
is cooked drain through a cullender, so that the potatoes retain 
the moisture of the butter and many particles of parsley.

as you take them out. Saratoga potatoes are often eaten cold. 
They can be prepared three or four hours before needed, and 
if kept in a warm place they will be crisp and nice.

outs.de layers. Chop the inside thus obtainei very fine, witli 
a little cold fat pork or bacon. Add bread crumbs, pepper, 
salt, mace, and wet with a spoonful or two of cream (or niilk in 
default of cream). Bind with a well-beaten egg, and work into 
a smooth paste. Stuff the onions with this ; put into:i dripping

299. Mushrooms. 

The cook should be well acquainted with the different sorts 
of things called by this name by ignorant people, as the deaths 
of many persons have been caused by carelessly using the poi- 
sonous kinds. The eatable mushrooms first appear very small 
and of a round form on a very small stalk. They grow very 
fast, and the upper part and stalk are white. As the sue 
increases, the under part gradually opens and shows a fnngy 
fur of a very fine salmon color, which continues more or less 
tiU the mushroom has been picked, when it turns to a brown. 
The skin can be more easily peeled .'rom the real ."Jf 'iroorn 
than from the poisonous kind. A good test .s to sprinkle a little 
salt on the spongy part or gills of the sample to be tried ; if 
they turn black they are wholesome, if yellow they are poison- 
ous. Give the salt a little time to act, before you decide as to 
their quality.

OBSERVATIONS ON PICKLES. 

Enamelled kettles should always be used in preference to 
those of brass or copper, as the verdigris produced by thevine- 
car on these metals is extremely poisonous. For some pickles 
i-se cold vinegar, as in boiling most of the strength is lost by 
evaporation. ^For French beans, brocoli, cauhnowers, gherkins, 
etc it is better to heat the vinegar, for which the following 
process is recommended :— Put the vinegar and spice in a jar, 
cover it ti^htlv, let it simmer on the back of the stove, 
^^hakc occasionally. Pickles should never be put' into 
glazed jars, as salt and vinegar penetrate the glaze, which is 

^"' GlSs^ or stone jars are preferable to any other ; a small 
niece of alum in each jar will make the pickles firm and cnsp. 
One tablespoonful of sugar to each quart of vinegar will be 
found a very great improvement to all pickles. Always use the 
best cider or wine vinegar. 

375. Onions (i)— Ingredients— Onions, best white wine vinegar, allspice 
and whole black pepper. 
In the month of September, choose the small white round 
onions take off the brown skin, have ready a very nice tin stew- 
mn of boiling water, throw in as many onions as will cover the 
OP • as soon as they look clear on the outside, take them up as 
ouicklv as possible with a slice, aud lay them on a clean cloth, 
cover them close with another, and scald some more, and so 
on Let them lie to be cold, then put them in a jar or glass, 
or 'wide mouthed bottles, and pour over them the best white 
wine vinegar, just hot but not boiling. To each gallon of vine- 
gar ndd one ounce of allspice and one of black pepper. Wneii 
?oid," cover them. Should the outer skin shrivel, peei it oif. 
They must look quite clear.

tion until you have as many eggs as you wish to preserve. 
Have some sawdust in boxes and pack them in it. At the end 
of two or three months the eggs will be found quite good 
enough for culinary purposes. Eggs can be kept for a long 
time if the shells are smeared with butter or sweet oil, then 
packed in plenty of sawdust, not allowing the eggs to touch 
each other. Another way is to plunge them in hme water 
directly they have been laid, and allow the vessel to stand m a 
cool cellar. Eggs for preserving should not be more than 
twenty-four hours old, and should be collected in fine weather. 
Take care the eggs are covered with the lime water, and it is a 
good plan to lay a piece ot board on the top of the eggs with a 
little lime and salt upon it.

OBSERVATIONS ON FORCEMEATS. 

Whether in the form of stuffing-balls or for patties, force- 
meat makes a considerable part of good cooking, by the flavor 
it imparts to the dish it accompanies, and considerable care 
should be taken in cooking it. It is often the case, at many 
excellent tables where everything else is well done, to find very 
bad forcemeat or stuffing. 

442 Forcemeat (to Force Fowls or Meat)— Ingredients— A 

A little ham or gammon, veal, or fowl, beef-suet, onion, parsley, 

lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, pounded mace, white pepper or cayenne, 

bread-crumbs, I or 2 eggs. 

Shred a little ham or gammon, some cold veal, or fowl, 

some beef-suet ; a small quantity of onion, some parsley, very 

little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg or pounded mace, and either 

white pepper or cayenne, and bread-crumbs. Pound in a 

mortar, and bind it with one or two eggs beaten and stramed ; 

for forcemeat patties the same mixture as above.

(for cold Savory PI©J— Ingredients— As 



The same ; only substituting fat, or bacon, for suet. The 
livers (if the pie be of rabbit or fowls), mixed with fat and lean 
of pork, instead of bacon, and seasoned as above, is excellent. 

444 Forcemeat;(Common, for Veal or Hare) -Ingredients 

1/. u, of b'-'^ad rninibs. A. oz. of beef suet, the rind of half a lemon, 

i'tablespoonful of mimed savory herbs, pepper and salt to taste, a

Take the pounded veal and rub through a sieve, with an 
equal quantity of udder, or if there is no udder at hand one 
third of the quantity of butter will do instead. Then place the 
bread crumbs into a stewpan and mix with a very small quantity 
of milk, enough to moisten it. Add to this the chopped parsley 
and shallot, and mix well until they have become a paste ; pour 
it through a sieve and leave to cool. When cold pound it and

OBSERVATIONS ON UREAL). 

Of all articles of food, bread is perhaps the most important, 
therefore it is necessary to be well acquainted with the quality 
of the ingredients and the art of making it. Elour ought to be 
a few weeks old before being used, and care must be taken to 
keep it perfectly dry. Genuine flour will holj together in a 
mass when pressed with the hand. American flour requires 
almost twice as much water to make it into bread, as is used 
for English flour, and therefore it is more profitable, for a stone 
of the American which weighs fourteen pounds will make 
twenty-one and a half pounds of bread, but the best sort of 
English flour produces only eighteen and one-half pounds. In 
wet weather, or when wheat is badly stored, causing it to be 
damp, the soluble albuminoids which it possesses acts upon the 
insoluble gluten causing it to decompose, and at once generat- 
mg dextrin by their action on the starch of the grain, conse- 
quently the flour prepared from such grain is poor in gluten and 
rich in dextrin, the consequence being that when used it 
produces heavy bread, therefore it .:. of the utmost importance 
to purchase only the best quality of flour, for it is the truest 
economy. Do not place the sponge or dough too near the fire, 
as some cooks are liable to do in cold weather, or the quality of 
bread will be endangered. The proper heat should be gentle 
and equal for fermentation. Care must also be taken to mix 
and knead (brisk and long kneading will fully repay for the 
trouble) when it has reached the point for either. Some 
authorities say the heat of the oven should rise to 280° and 
after a quarter of an hour slacken to 2?o°, others from 300' to 

400 . The cook must ho cinVied ^>" ^avrwri^p'^" -^^ ♦n ^^c- .f 

degree of heat. Doubtless the bread will require a brisk oven, 
and should take about an hour to an hour and a half to bake. 



Bread and Cakes. 



141 



OBSERVATIONS ON CAKES. 

For good cakes (as in bread) it ib of great importance to 
use no ingredients, but tliose of the finest quality. The flour 
must be dry and sifted. It will be found a good plan after 
purchasing currants, to wash in three waters, pick ana dry in a 
cloth. Then look them carefully over, discarding any stone, 
stalk, or grit. Lay before the fire or in the sun to dry. Put by 
in jar, and they will always be ready for use. Eggs should be 
well whisked, the whites and yolks beaten separately and 
strained. Butter must not be allowed to oil. Lemon peel 
should be cut thinly as possible. Sugar should be fmely 
powdered. When soda is used it is a good plan to dissolve it 
in warm water. When all the ingredients are mixed, vigorous 
and patient beating will greatly add to the lightness of the cake. 
The heat of the oven is of great importance for cakes, especially 
those that are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not 
rise. Should you fear its catching by being too quick, put some 
paper over the cake to prevent its being burnt. If not long 
enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is Secome slack, 
the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a 
broom straw, and pierce into the very centre, draw it instantly 
out, nd if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake immediately 
in, and shut up the even. 

452 Yeast (I)— Ingredients— A double handful of hojis, Yz doz potatoes, 
•-^ i;al. of water, I or >i cupful of ginger, small cupful of flour, a 
cupful of brown sugar, ji cupful of salt, a cupful of good yeast. 
Allow the hops and potatoes to boil together in one-half 
gallon of water till done ; strain and mash the ginger, then add 
remaining ingredients, excepting the yeast. Let stand until 
cool, then add the yeast. Next day cork up tight m a jug. 
453. Yeast (2)— Ingredients— 2 oz. of hops, I gal. of water, a handful of 
salt, I lb. of best flour, 3 lbs. of potatoes.

frequently while making, and keep it wnrm. Before using, 
shake the bottle up well. It will keep in a cool place for two 
months. 

454- Yoast (Compressed). 

This yeast will uuike good and wholesome bread, but bread 
made from it will not keep as long as with brewers or home- 
made yeast. Potatoes mixed with the dough will keep it moist 
longer. 

455' Potato Yeast— Ingredients — To every lb. of pmaloes 2 oz. 
of tre.icle, 2 larj^e spoonfuls of yeast. 

This is made of mealy potatoes boiled thoroughly soft ; they 
are skinned and mashed as smooth as possible ; as much hot 
water should then be put on them as will make a mash of the 
consistency of good beer yeast. Add to the potatoes the 
treacle ; and when just warm, stir in the yeast. Keep it warm 
till it has done fermenting, and in t vcnty-four hours it will be 
fit for use. One pound of potatoes will make nearly a quart of 
yeast ; and it is said to be equally as good as brewers' yeast.

Put the flour into a deep pan, sprinkle a little salt into it,

yeast, which has been made solid by liberally mixing with cold 
water and allowing it to settle twenty-four hours. Then pro- 
ceed to pour the yeast into the hole in the flour, and mix with 
it as much flour as is round about it until it is of the consistency 
of thick baiter ; be careful there are no lump.-;. Sift plenty of 
flour over the top, cover with a clean cloth, and set it where the 
air is warm and equal. Allow to stand an hour or a little 
longer, and if the yeast has broken through it is then ready to 
be made into dough. Pour into the sponge the remaining milk 
and water. Mix into it as much of the flour as you can with 
the spoon. Now take plenty of the tlor.r, sprinkle on the top 
of the leaven, and proceed to knead briskly, and wlien perfectfy

water or milk (which use warm in winter, and cold in summer), 
not mixing in all the flour ; then put a blanket, or towel, over 
the pan, and let it stand to rise, near the fire in winter. This 
is " putting bread in sponge." When it has risen, mix all the 
flour with the sponge ; knead it well, and let it stand two hours 
till quite light. Then mould the dough on a board tiU elastic, 
and put '.he loaves into greased or floured baking-tins ; prick 
them two or three times through with a fork ; let them rise 
again for a quarter of an hour, and bake them in a quick oven. 

458. White Bread— Ingredients— Sponge. -. pan of butter milk, or 

sour milk, (lour, teacupful of yeast. 
For the sponge take a pan of butter;. ulk or sour milk which 
has just turned thick. Put it on the stove and scald. When 
the curd is well s. |m. d from the whey strain or skii it out. 
Let the whey ^ i./i until it will not scald, then stir in the flour, 
beating thoroughly. It should be about as thick as batter for 
griddle cakes. Sweet milk, or even water may be used as 
wetting for the sponge, if good our milk or buttermilk cannot 
be had. But fresh buttermilk is, perhaps, the best of all. 
When the sponge is about milkwarm, beat in a teacupful of 
yeast One teacupful of the yeast is enough for four ordinary 
white loaves, and a tin of rolls. The sponge should be made 
at nieht. Let it stand until morning. Unless the weather is 
very cold, it is not necessaiv to yuz ic " i^ tnc urc m u;o 
morning, when the sponge is light i ix with flour, taking care 
not to put in too much, as that wii, make the bread dry and 
hard. Knead half an hour. The whiteness and delicacy of the

bread will be much increased by thorough kneading. Put the 
dough away to rise again. When it is light, if you wish to make 
rolls, save enough of the donph for that purpose. Make the 
remainder into loaves. Set them away to rise. When light, 
bake. 

Yoast Bread— Ingredients — Ve.ost, 12 pot.itoes, 3 large table- 
spoonfuls of Hour, 2 each of sugar and salt, 2 yeast cakes, to every 
loaf of bread allow i pint of yeast, 

To make the yeast pare twelve medium-sized potatoes and 
put them in a kettle to boil. While they are boiling put in a 
jian tliree heaped tablcspoonfuls of flov.r, two each of sugar and 
salt. Four slowly over these a pint of boiling water, stirring 
constantly to free from lumps. When soft mash the potatoes 
and add to the contents of the pan. Now pour in a quart of 
cold water and one of boiling water. Set aside till cool enough 
to bear your finger in. Stir in two ytast cakes dissolved in a 
little water. Keep warni till a foam rises over the top, when it 
is ready for use. For each loaf of the bread take one pint of 
the yeast, no other wetting being required. Make a hole in the 
centre of a pan of flour, pour in the yeast and stir it thick as 
possible, cover and set in a warm place to rise, ^\hich will be in 
about two hours— sometimes less — now mix into loaves, let it 
rise again, and bake from a half to three-quarters of an hour. 
A great advantage of this bread is, it is so quickly made. If 
the yeast should become a little sour, a pinch of soda may be 
put in when first stirred for bread. 

460. Plain Bread— Ingredients —;^ lb, of white flour, i teaspoonful 
of baking powder, a pinch of salt X pt^ of milk and water. 

The simplest way of making bread in small quantities is as 
follows :— Take one-half {)ound of white flour, and, whilst in a 
dry state, mix in thoroughly a small teaspoonful baking powder 
and a pinch of salt. Then add about a quarter of a pint of 
niilk and water, or water alnne ; knead it as quickly as possible 
and put immediately into a very hot oven ; the whole secret of 
making light bread afier this fashion lies in attention to these 
last rules. If the oven is well heated, it will rise almost directly, 
iiud it should be baked until the outside is qtiite crisp and 
hard. I generally knead mine into the desired shape, but they 
can be baked in tins if preferred. For brown bread, I use 
three parts of brown and one of white flour, and a little extra

haking powder ; also adding a liltle more water, if necessary, 
to mix it. 

461. Rico and Wheat Bl-ead— Ingredients— i lb. of rice, 2 qts. of 
water, 4 ll)s. of Hour, 4 large spoonfuls of yeast, salt. 
Simmer a pound of ri -e in two quarts of water till it becomes 
perfectly soft ; when it is of a proper warmth, mix it extremely 
well with four pounds of flour, and yeast and salt as for other 
bread; of yeast about four large spoonfuls ; knead it extremely 
well ; then set it to rise before the fire. Some of the flour 
should be reserved to make up the loaves. If the rice should 
require more water, it must be added, as some rice swells more 
than others. 

462. French Bread— Ingredients— X pk- of fine flour, yolks of 3 
and whites of 2 eggs, salt, >^ pt. of good yei^st, >^ pt. of milk. 

With a quarter of a peck of fine flour mix the yolks of three 

and whites of two eggs, beaten and strained, a little salt, half a 

pint of good yeast, that is not bitter, and as much milk, made 

a little warm, as will work into a thin light dough ; stir it about, 

but don't knead it ; have ready three quart wooden dishes, 

divide the dough among them, set to rise, then turn them out 

into the oven, which must be quick. Rasp when done. 



463. 



BrOVI^n Bread— Ingiedients— Sponge as for white bread, 2 parts 
of Graham flour, '/^ while flour, to every qt. of this add a large 
breakfast cupful of Indian meal, 2 saltspoonfuls of salt, for a good 
sized loaf allow }4 a cupful of molasses. 
Take the Graham and white flour, Indian meal, and salt, in 
the above proportions, and mix this up with the sponge, then 
pour in the molasses. If it cannot be brought to the proper 
congruity (which should be very soft) with the sponge, add a 
little warm water ; be careful to knead it well and for a long 
time ; then allow it tc rise ; it will take longer tnan white bread ; 
then make into loaves, and bake carefully. When baked allow 
to cool before cutting. 

464. Brown Bread (2)— Ingredients— i pt. of brown flour, )4 cupful 
of yeast, white flour, sweeten to taste. 
Scald one pint of brown flour, make it as thick as stiff 
mush ; then put in half a cupful of yeast, and let this spcng* 
stand over night ; in the morning mix it up with white flour, 
and sweeten to taste. This quantity makes two small loaves. 
It requires longer to bake than white bread.

three-quarters of an hour or until done. If the tins have paper 
at the bottom they bake better, and do not stick. If you have 
not sour milk, sweet will do, but buttermilk is the best of all. 
These cakes can be kept in the tins and heated up the next

cient to make a thin batter) and allow it to rise all night. 
Next morning add eggs, butter and sugar (which must have 
been mixed well together), salt and flour enough to produce a 
soft dough. Shape into neat balls of equal size, place in a pan 
and allow to rise until very light. Flavor according to taste.

lastly stir in the whites, which should be whisked very dry. 
The batter should not be beaten after the whites are in. Grease 
your yaffle irons after having heated them fill them nearly 
full of the batter, close them, and place the.i over the fire; 
turn the irons so as to bake the waffle on botu sides, When

Warm the butter in the milk ; beat the eggs ; mix them 
with the milk and butter, and pour altogether iiuo the pan of 
flour; then add the rose-water, cinnamon, and >east. iMix all 
thoroughly, knead the dough well, let it rise ; when light, make 
it out into cakes ; put them in buttered pans, let them stand 
till they rise again, and bake them. 

496. Easter Buns— Ingredients— ;^ nuartern of white bread dough, 
o oz. fresh butter, 6 oz. white sugar, 4 eggs. 

Beat the sugar and eggs together and mix them well with 
the dough (if it is stiff the best pian is to beat it with your 
hand, but if not a spoon will answer the purpose). Whin this 
is done add the butter. Put the mixture into tins or cups, and 
bake for about twenty minutes in a quick oven. 

497- Pop-Overs — Ingredients— Tnke oi equal proportions (say 2 cup. 
fuls) milk and flour, 2 eggs, a little salt, butter the size of an egg. 

Mix the salt in the flour, beat the eggs, add to it milk and 
pour upon the flour; mix well, melt the butter and add to 
other ingredients ; the last thing, grease and half fill the tins ; 
bake quickly. 

498. Doughnuts— Ingredients—2 qts. flour, i teacupful of sour cream, 
2 cuofuls of sugar, 3 eggs, i teaspoonful of soda. 

Place a pan of lard on stove to boil, beat sugar and eggs 
together, dissolve the soda in a litde warm water, add cream, 
now sift in the flour as you stir, adding a litde spice if preferred! 
Roll out the dough, cut in rings or make into twists. Fry a 
golden brown in the boiling lard. 

499- Buttermilk Cakes. 

Take one pint of buttermilk, and stir into it as much flour 
as will form a dough, with one tablespoonful of dissolved car- 
bonate of ammonia; roll the dough out in sheets, cut the cakes, 
and bake them in a moderate oven. The carbonate of ammo- 
nia may be obtained at any of the druggists ; it is the common 
smelling-salts, without any of the aromatic drugs. It never 
imparts any taste to the food, as the heat disengages the car- 
bonic acid gas and the ammonia. 

500. Mush Cakes- Ingredients -I qt. of milk, V lb. of butter, flour 
enough to make a dough, salt according to taste, Indian meal suffi- 
ciaU lo thicken ihe milk, % a pt. of yeasl.

Boil the milk, and stir into it as much Indian meal, mixed 
with cold milk, as will make a mush as thick as batter ; add 
the butter and salt while the mush is hot ; as soon as it be- 
comes lukewarm stir in the yeast and as much flour as will 
fornj a dough ; cover it and stand it to rise. When light, make 
it cut into biscuits, put them in buttered pans, and, as soon as 
they rise again, bake them in a hot oven. These cakes are 
very nice. 

501. BuCkvtfheat Cakes— Ingredients— I pt. of buckwheat meal, I 

qt. of water, salt according to taste, I gill home-made yeast. 

Mix the water (which should be lukewarm if the weather is 
cold) with the meal ; add the salt and yeast ; beat it well ; 
when light, bake them on a griddle. Grease the griddle ; poui 
on a little of the batter ; spread it so as to form a cake about 
the size of a breakfast-plate; the cakes should be very smooth at 
the edges. When they are done on one side, turn them ; 
when brown on both sides, put sonic butter on the plate, put 
the cake on it, butter the top, bake another and put on it, but- 
ter hot, and send them to the table. Buckwheat cakes are 
much better if they are sent to the table with only one or two 
on the plate. 

502. Rye Batter Cakes— Ingredients — l pt. of rye meal, enough 

lukewarm milk to make a tliin baiter, salt according to taste, one 
gill home-made yeast. 

Add enough lukewarm milk to the rye to make a thin bat- 
ter, with salt ; beat it well, then add the yeast ; when they are 
light, bake them on a griddle, as buckwheat cakes. 

503. Milk and Butter Cakes— Ingredients— J4f of a lb. of flour, 

Yz lb. of butter, >4 lb. of sugar, I teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, as 
much milk as will form a dough.

degrees ; stir in as much milk as will make a dough ; knead it 
well, roll it out in sheets, cut in cakes, butter your tins, lay 
them on so as not to touch, and bake in a moderate oven. 

504. Sponge Jelly Cake— Ingredients— 3 eggs, 4 oz. of sugar, r 

cup of flour, I dessertspoonful of baking powder, 3 tablespoonfuls of 
boiling water. 

Mix the baking powder willi the flour, and beat each of 
the eggs separately. Then mix all the ingredients together,

jelly if preferred. 

505. Jelly RollS-IngredieiUs- .5 cf;t;s. 'J a cupful of butter, i/^' tea- 

spoonful of baking powder, f^ of a cup of pulverized sugar, i cup 
ful of tlour, a little salt. •^ r b . 1 

Bake in shallow pans— a dripping pan well buttered is good 
for this purpose; put in the dough till it is about half an inch 
thick; take it carefully from the tins when baked and lay on a

510. Icihsi for Cakes n) Ingredients 4 cnt;s, i 11.. of finely 

j.owdtreil wliite suyar, vanilla, .strawberry, lemon, or .any other 

tlavorint;. 
Take tlie whites of the eggs, and beat well adding the sugar 
to stiffen in small quantities ; continue until you have beaten 
the eggs to a stiff froth ; it will take aljout half an hour if well 
beaten all the time; if not stiff enough then add more sugar; 
spread carefully on the cake with a broad bladed knife ; to 
color icing yellow, put the grated peel of a lemon (or orange) 
into a piece of muslin, strain a little juice through it and press 
hard into the other ingredients. Strawberry juice or cranberry 
syrup colors a jiretty pink color. 

511. ICinS for Cakes (2)— Inf^redients— The whites of ^ eggs, li 

lb. oi ca.st()r sugar, and the juice of a lemon or a few drops of orange 

flower water. 
Beat the mixture until it hangs upon the ft)rk in flakes, then 
spread over the cake, dipping the kmfe in coid water occasion- 
ally; stand it before the fire, and keep turning the cake 
constantly, or the sugar will catch and turn brown ; as soon as 
it begins to harden it may be removed ; the icing must not be 
put on until the cake itself is cold, otherwise it will not set. A 
few drops of cochineal will color it if desired. 

512. Excellent Frosting. 

Take one cupful of granulated sugar and four tablespoonfuls 
of hot water, boil them together until it threads from the spoon, 
stirring often. Beat the white of one egg until firm ; when the 
sugar is ready set it from the stove long enough to stop 
boiling, then pour on to the egg slowly, but continually, beat- 
ing rapidly ; continue to beat until of the right consistency to 
spread on the cake and flavor wViile beating ; it hardens very 
quickly after it is ready to put on the cake, so it is best to have 
the white of another eeg ready to add a littte if it gets too hard 
to spread smoothly. Boil the sugar the same as for candy ; 
when right for candy it is right for frosting ; if at last it hardens 
very rapidly it has been boiled too hard ; but a little white of 
egg will rectify it. Or if not boiled enough (that is, if it 
remains too thin after beaten until cold) put in pulverized 
sugar, adding a little and beating hard, then if not just right, a 
little more and beat again until thick enough. The one thmf 
is to have the sugar boiled just righ ; if you hit that point you 
will not have a bit of trouble, it not, it will require " doctonng,

ns I have told you. A good deal d( pcnds upon stirring the 
sugar into the white of the egg at first : if too fast or too slow 
It will cook the egg in lumps ; if you should not get it just 
right at tirst do not be discouraged ; when once you get it 
perfect you will never make it any other way. This .luantity 
is for one cake.

of butter. Lay the mixture all over the cake witJi a kriife, and 
lay it on as smoothly as possible. Put the cake in the oven 
just long enou[,h for the icing to glaze. Take it cr-t, nnd befoi e

OBSERVATIONS. 

A good hand at pastry will use less butter and produce 
lighter crust than others. Salt butter is very good, and if 
well washed makes a good flaky crust. If the weather is warm 
the butter should be placed in ice water to keep it as firm as 
possible ; when lard is used take care it is jjcrfectly sweet. 

In making pastry {See Fastry Recipes), as in other 
arts, " practice will make perfect ; " it should be touched as 
lightly as possible, made in a cool place, and with hands per- 
fectly cool ; if possible, use a marble slab instead of a pastry 
board ; if the latter is used, it is better to procure it made of 
hardwood. 

It is important to use great expedition in the preparation of 
pastry, and care must be taken not to allow it to stand long 
before baking, or it will become flat and heavy. A brisk oven 
will be required for puff pastry ; a good plan to test the proper 
heat is to put a small piece of the paste in before baking the 
whole. Be sure that the oven is as near perfection as possible \ 
for, "an oven in which the heat is not evenly distributed can 
never produce a well baked pie or tarl ; where there is an 
unequal degree of heat the pastry rises on the hottest side in 
the shape of a large bubble and sinks into a heavy indigestible 
lump on the coolest." This is a truism which many people 
must have discovered for themselves, as they would be well 
accustomed to the sight of miniature mountains and tableland 
on their tarts and pies. Raised pie crust should have a good 
soaking heat, and glazed pastry rather a slack heat. When suet 
is used it must be perfectly free from skin and minced as finely 
r^s possible ; beef suet is considered the best. 

All moulds, pie dishes, patty pans, and vessels of all 
descriptions used for baking or boiling must be well buttered.

The Dominion Cook Uook. 



The outside of a boiled pudding often tastes disacreeablv 
which arises from the cloth not being nicely washed, and kept 
in a dry place. It should be dipped in boiling water, squeezed 
dry, and floured when to be used. » i a 

If bread, it should be tied loosely, if batter, tightly over. 

Ihc water should boil quickly when the pudding is put in • 
and It should be moved about for a minute, lest the ingredients 
should not mix. ^ 

Batter pudding should be strained through a coarse sieve 
when all is nuxed. In others the eggs separately 

A pan of cold water should be ready, and* the pudding 
dippc^d m as soon as it comes out of the pot, and then it will 
not adhere to the cloth. 

Very good puddings may be made 7e'/Yioia ej^ss : but thev 
must have as little milk as will mix, and must1)oil three or 
tour hours. A spoonful of yeast will answer instead of eggs 

-Smm> IS an excellent substitute for eggs either in puddings 
or pancakes. Two large spoonfuls will supply the place of one 
egg, and the article it is used in will be equally good. This is 
a useful piece of information, especially as snow often falls at 
the season when eggs are the dearest. The snow may be taken 
up from any rlean si)ot before it is wanted, and will not lose 
Its virtue, though the sooner it is used the better. 

JVote.—'i'Uc yolks and whites beaten long and separately

6i8. Holiday Pudding— Ingredients— A plain sponge cake, straw- 
berry jam, icing, a rich custard, some preserved ginger. 

Make the spoi .• cake in a round mould, take out the 
inside of the cake v.uh a cutter not too near the edge, put in a 
good layer of strawberry jam, not too thickly spread. Cut the 
inside of the cake you have taken out in slices, spread some 
jam between each slice (different sorts of jam may be used, but 
strawberry does very nicely), and replace the cake. Ice it nicely 
over ; put it into a very slow oven to try the icing. Then make 
the custard and pour into it small pieces of preserved ginger, 
i^our into the cake and serve hot.

Put the milk into a stevvpan with white sugar and a stick of 
vanilla ; leave it to boil ten minutes. Mix the yolks of ten 
eggs with the cream, pour in the milk, then put it back into the 
stewpan, and stir until it thickens, but do not let it boil ; strain 
It into a basin, and leave it to cool. Take the ice, pound it 
small, add the salt ; mix together quickly, cover the bottom of 
an ice pail (a common pail will do), place the ice pot in it, and 
build it around with the ice and salt. This done pour the cream 
into the pot, put on the cover, and never csase turning until 
the cream becomes thick ; move it from the sides occasionally 
with the ice scoop, to prevent it getting into hard lumps. The 
mould to be used to set the pudding should be put on ice to 
get quite cold. It is then filled with the cream to the level, 
and three or four pieces of white paper wetted with cold water 
are placed on it before you put on the cover, which should fit 
very tight. The mould is then buried in the same mixture of 
ice and salt used for freezing the cream in the first instance, and 
is left until wanted, when it is dipped in cold water, turned out 
on a napkin, and served. Dried fruits, cut small, may be put 
in the cream when the mould is being filled. 

633. Roiy Poly Jam Pudding- Ingredients-Suet crust, 10 oz. 

of any kind of jam. 

Having made a nice suet crust, roll to the th'Vkness of about 
half an inch. Place the jam in the centre a spread equally 
over the paste, allowing a margin of about haii an inch for the 
pudding to join. Roll up lightly, join the ends securely, place 
upon a floured cloth, and secure with tape, allowing a little 
room for the pudding to swell. Plunge into boiling water and 
boil two hours. 

634. Red Currant Pudding-Ingredients-Some red currants and 

raspberries, £up:ar, slices of bread. 

Stew the red currants and raspberries with sugar till thor- 
oughly done, pour off all the juice, and put the fruit while hot 
into a pudding basin lined with bread made to fit nieely ; fill 
the basin up with fruit, and cover it with a slice of bread made 
to fit nicely ; let it stand till quite cold with a plate on it. Boil 
up the juice which was poured off with a little more sugar, 
and let that get cold. When served the pudding must be 
turned out on a dish and the juice poured all over it so as to 
color the bread thoroughly. It can be served with custard or 
cream.

Ingredients — I 



egg, a pinch of salt, 



Yorkshire Pudding (i) - 

milk. 4 t.'ihlcspoonfiils of fli)ur. 

Take the egg and salt and beat with a fork for a few minutes. 
Add to this three tablespoonfuls of milk and the flour ; beat 
(with a spoon) very well, whilst in a batter, for ten minutes. 
Then add milk till it attains almost the consistency of cream. 
Take care to have the dripping hot in the pudding tin. Pour 
the batter into the tin to the thickness of about a quarter of an 
inch, then bake under the roasting joint. The above will make 
a pudding of moderate size, perhaps one dozen squares. The 
great secret of a pudding being light is to mix it two hours 
before cooking it. 

659. Yorkshire Pudding(2)— Ingredients- 6tab]espoonfuls(heaped) 

of Hour, ij^ pis. of milk, 3 eggs. 

Put the flour in a basin with a little salt, stir in enough milk 
to make it a stiff batter. When quite smooth put in the eggs, 
well beaten, and the rest of the milk. Beat again, put in shal- 
low tin rubbed with beef dripping. Bake for an hour, then put 
under the meat half an hour to catch a little dripping. Cut in 
small squares to serve. The secret of lightness is to have 
smooth batter highly beaten, hot oven, and serving very quickly 
— in fact, that intelligent care in small details which gives 
perfect cooking. 

660. Steak Pudding— Ingredients— >^ lb. of suet, 18 oz. of flour, a

the flour, and then mix in the suet. Add gradually a glass of 
cold water (about half a pint), mixing alt the time ; roll into a 
sheet. Cut the steak into pieces and the kidney into slices, 
sprinkling well with pepper and salt. Grease a pudding mould 
and line it with the paste. Place the tv>eal. in and pour in about 
two wine glasses of cold water. T ,. meat must only come 
level with the top. Cover with the pas e, tie down in a floured 
cloth, plunge into boiling water and boil for two and a quarter 
hours. 

661. Graham Pudding— Ingredients— 2 cups of Graham flour, 2

as much water as will make the flour into a vtry stiff paste; 
roll it very thin, then 'ay the third part cf half a pound of butter 
upon it in little pieces ; dredge with some flour left out at first 
and roll up tight. Roll it out again, and put the same propoi- 
tion of butter, and so proceed till all be worked up. 

702. Genoise Pastry— ingredients— X lb. of the freshest butter, 4 

oz. of white sugar, 4 eggs, }:(. lb. of fine flour. 

Take the butter, put it in a bowl, and warm it until it can 
be beaten with a spoon ; add to it the su};ar, and beat the two 
together until a smooth white cream is obtained, then add one 
egg, and keep on beating the mixture till it is smooth again, 
then add three more eggs in the same manner. Tlie speck of 
the eggs should be removed. Lastly, incorporate quickly with 
the mixture the flour, and as soon as it is smooth pour it out to 
the thickness of half an inch on a buttered flat tin, and put it 
into the oven at once. When done (in about ten or fifteen 
minutes) turn out the slab of Genoise, and put it to cool, under 
side uppermost, on a sieve. There is a great knack in beating 
this paste to prevent its curdling. Should this happen, it can 
generally be remedied by beating as quickly as possible until 
the mixture is smooth again.

the mixture assumes the consistency of a smooth thick cream. 
Take a slab of Genoise, spread on the top of it the thinnest 
possible coating of apricot jam, then a coating of the icing. 
Put it into a very hot oven for rather less than a minute, take 
it out, and place it in a cold place to get cool ; then cut it up 
with a sharp knife in lozenges or any other shape, and serve 
piled up on a napkin. 

704. Aimond Genoise— Ingredients— 2 oz. of blanched almonds, n 

little orange flower water, 2oz. of fresh butter (warmed), 4 oz. of white 
sugar, yolks of 4, and wliites of 2 eggs, 4 oz. of fine flour, essence of

the midd e of it, put in it the yolks of the eggs, freed from the 
speck, salt, the juice of half a lemon, and the fourth part of the 
butter cut up in very small pieces; work the paste as quickly as 
possible with the fingers of one hand, adding as much moder- 
ately tepid water as will make the paste smooth,and of the same 
consistency as the remaining one and a half pounds of butter 
Jkat the latter out into a flat square piece an inch in thickness ; 
roll out the paste to four times the size of the ricce of butter, 
lay this in the centre of the paste, which you fold over on each 
side, and roll otit again to three times its original size, then 
fold over tvvo sides only of the piece of paste, and roll it out 
again as before Repeat this operation twice, cover the paste 
with a woollen cloth, and let it rest for half an hour. The oper- 
ation^of rolling out and folding up the paste is called "giving a 
turn. After the paste has rested, two more turns are to be 
given to it, and it will be ready.

reel and core the apples, cut them in slices a quarter of an 
inch thick, trim all the slices to the same shape, dispose all 
these over the marmalade, overlapnin^r each other, and in 
some kind of pattern ; strew plenty of sugar over, and hake in 
a quick oven till the apples are a good color. 

744. Apple Tart (2)-Ingre(lients-Short paste, 6apples, thin rind and 

jiucc of a Icmun, white sugar, 4 or 5 eggs. 

Line a J^an mould (a flnt tin with an upright edge one inch 
to one and a half inches high) with a thin crust of short paste. 
Stew the peeled, cored, and quartered apples with a little 
water, the thin rind of the lemon, and white sugar ^/uan/. suff.; 
when quite tender, beat them up with a fork ; add the juice and 
grated rind of the lemon, and work \n one by one the yolks of 
the eggs, pour this mixture in the mould, and bake in a quick 
oven about half an hour. 

745. Apple Tart (3)— Ingredients— Some uncooked rice, apple mar- 

uialade, apricot jam, icing, glace sugar, white of eggs.

marmalade. Spread over it a thin layer of apricot jam, and 
over that a thick layer of icing, made with the glace sugar and 
whites of egg beaten up. Put the tin in a very slack oven, just 
long enough to set the icing without coloring it, and serve cold. 
It may be ornamented with blanched pistachio nuts, strips of 
angelica, and candied cherries laid on the icing, before put- 
ting the tart in the oven. 

N. B. — To make icing, as much sugar should be beaten up 
with the white of egg as it will absorb until the mixture is of 
the consistency of the thickest double cream ; whereas to make 
meringue, not more than half an ounce of sugar should be used 
for each white of egg.

RECIPES FOR rviAKING ICE CREAM 

Note.— When pure cream is used, half the number of 
quarts that the can will hold will be sufficient, as the beater will 
make it light and spongy so that it will nearly fill t'le can. In 
using milk the can may be three-fourths filled. 

800. Dissolve in two quarts of pure fresh cream ,^ twelve to 
fourteen ounces of best white sugar, flavor as given bclu>v, strain 
into the freezing can and frc 'ze according to above (hreciions 

801. Making Ice Cnamfrom yli77-('.— Bring two quarts rich 
milk to a boiling point, sti- in two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot 
or corn starch, previously rubbed smooth in a cupful of cold 
milk. Remove from the fire and add four eggs and three quar- 
ters of a pound of sugar well beaten together, stir all well 
together and then set aside to cool. Flavor and freeze as 
before directed. 

FLAVORS 

802. Vanilla.— Ow^ tablcspoonfulof good extract of Vanilla. 

803. Lemon.— -khoM'i three teaspoonfuls each of extract of 
Lemon and Lemon juice. 

804. Bisque.— Mdi about two handfuls of powdered sifted 
dry sponge cake and a dessertspoonful of extract of Nectarine. 

805. ChocolUe Ice Cream. - Melt in a porcelain dish two 
ounces of Baker's cho olatc, and about three ounces of water 
and four ounc s oi fine white sugar, dissolve and stram mto the 
cream in fieezing can, and proceed as directed above. 

806. Fruit Ice Cream.— To two quarts of cream add about 
one quart of juice of such fruits as cherry, currant, strawberry, 
peach, orange, etc., finely strained, and one and a half pounds 
of fine white sugar, and freeze as above. 

807. Fruil Ices.— Dissolve three pounds of fine white 
sugar in two quarts of water and one quart of finely stiaincd 
juice of any of the above named fruits, and freeze the smiic as 
ice cream, It requires more time than the latter, and will not 
increase so much in bulk. For orange and strawberry ices add 
the juice of one large lemon.

OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVING. 

Fruit for preserving must be gathered in dry weather, and 
should be carefully selected, discarding all bruised fruit, 
and purchasing only that of the largest and finest quality. Use 
only the best white sugar, or the preserve cannot be perfect, 
and nothing is saved. If common sugar is used, it causes a 
greater amount of scum, and of course this must be taken off, 
consequently evaporation reduces the quantity. In making 
syrups the sugar must be pounded and dissolved in the syrup 
before setting on the fire; no syrups or jellies should be boiled 
too high. Fruits must not be put into a thick syrup at fn-.sl. 
Fruits preserved whole or sliced may be boiled in a syrup made 
of two pounds of sugar to every one pound of water, the quan- 
tity of syrup differing in some cases, but the general rule is one 
and a half the substance of fruit. We have found the following 
very good : To clarify six pounds of sugar, put into a preserv- 
ing pan, and pour to it five pints of cold spring waier ; in 
another pint beat lightly up the white of one small egg, but do 
not froth it very much ; add it to the sugar, and give it a stir to 
mix it well with the whole. Set the pan over a gentle fire when 
the sugar is nearly dissolved, and let the scum iise without 
being disturbed; when the syrup has boiled five minutes take 
It from the fire, let it stand a couple of minutes, and then skim 
it very clean; let it boil again, then throw in half a cup of co'd 
water, which will bring the remainder of the scum to the 
surface ; skim it until it is perfectly clear, strain it through a 
thin cloth, and it will be ready for use, or for further boiling. 

All unripe fruit must be rendered quite tender by gentle 
scalding, before ic is put into syrup, or it will not imbibe the 
sutrar : and t'u^ svrnn mnQf- l^o /)i,'» ivl->i"i h '<^ ^>-ct- "-1-1 .-? f- ;.

and clear. A pound of sugar boiled for ten minutes in one pint 
of water will make a very light syrup; but it will gradually 
thicken if rapidly boiled in an uncovered pan. Two pounds 
of sugar to the pint of water, will become thick with a little 
more than half an hour's boiling, or with three or four separate 
boilings of eight or ten minutes each ; if too much reduced it 
will candy instead of remaining liquid. 

In making jams many cooks after allowing the proper pro- 
portions of sugar to the fruit, put into the preserving pan 
without removing stones or skins until after boiling, as the 
flavor is thought to be finer by adopting this method. Glass 
bottles are preferable to any other as they allow inspection to 
detect incipient fermentation, which may be stayed by re-boiling. 
Copper or brass preserving pans are the best kind to use, but 
they require a great deal of care to keep clean ; the enamelled 
are very nice and easily kept in order. Jams should be kept 
in a dry, conl place, and if properly made will only require a 
small round of writing paper, cited, and laid on to fit ; now tie 
down securely with a second paper brushed over with the white 
of egg to exclude the air. If you should have the least fear of 
the store closet being damp, it would be better for the first 
paper to be dipped in brandy. Inspect them every two or 
three months. 

808. Plum Jam— Ingredients— Allow 3.^ lb. of white sugar to i lb. of 

fruit. 
It is difficult to give the exact quantity of sugar to be used 
in plum jam, in fact it entirely depends upon the quality of the 
plums used, therefore your own judgment will be necessary. 
After weighing the plums, halve them and remove the stones ; 
then place on a large dish and sprinkle with the sugar, leave 
them thus for twenty-four hours ; then put into a preserving 
pan and let them simmer gently on the back of the stove for 
about twenty-five or thirty minutes, then boil very quickly, for 
a quarter of an hour, skimming carefully, and stirring with a 
wooden spoon to prevent the jam sticking. It greatly improves 
the jam to put some kernels from the plum stones into it. 

809. Red Currant Jam— Ingredients— ^' of a lb. of white sugar 

to every pound of fruit. 

Let the fruit be very ripe, remove from the stalks with a sil- 
ver fork J dissolve the sugar over the fire, then put in the cur-

rants and boil for half an hour, stirring and skimming all the 
time. Put into jars and cover air tight. 

8io. Black Currant Jam— Ingredients— l gill of water, i lb. of 
fruit to I 11). of su^ar. 

Purchase the fruit ripe and dry ; having stripped from the 
stalk which can be done nicely with a silver fork, place them 
and the water into your preserving pan ; boil for ten minutes, 
then add the sugar, and allow to boil three-quarters of an hour 
from the time it begins to simmer; keep it constantly stirred ; 
carefully remove the scum. When done pot in the usual man- 
ner. 

8ii. Raspberry Jam— Ingredients— Allow i lb. of white i=ugar to i 
lb. of fruit, and 2 wine glasses of red currant juice. 

Directly this fruit is purchased preserve it, if allowed to 
stand the jam and the flavor will not be so good ; place in pre- 
serving pan and allow to boil twenty minutes, stirring constantly; 
add the sugar and currant juice and boil for half an hour. Be 
particular to skim well as this will make the jam nice and clear. 
When done, place in pots and cover. 

8i2. Rhubarb Jam —Ingredients— Rhubarb, to a pound of pulp 
allow I lb. of sugar, i oz. sweet almonds blanched and chopped, and 
half a lemon cut into slices. 

Peel and cut up the rhubarb, boil till reduced to a pulp 
with a very little water, add the sugar, almonds and lemon, boil 
for three-quarters of an hour or an hour, remove the lemon 
peel and put it into pots. 

813, Green Grape Jam— Ingredients— To i lb. of grapes allow % 

lb. of sugar. 

Pick them carefully and reject any that are injured, wash 
them. Put the grapes into a preserving pan, then a layer of sugar, 
then a layer of grapes. Boil on a moderate fire, stirring it all 
the time to prevent its burning, and as the grape stones rise take 
them out with a spoon, so that by the time the fruit is suffi- 
ciently boiled — about one hour — the stones will all have been 
taken out. Put into jars and cover in the usual way. 

814. BioiCkbCrry Ja.r?3 -Ingredients — To every lb. of picked fruit 

allow I lb. of loaf sugar and ^4 lb. of apples peeled and cored, and

815. Strawberry Jam— Ini^re(licnts--To i Hi. of fruit allow U }^' 

or I lb of sugar, to 4 lbs. of strawberries add i pt. of red currant juice. 
Put tlie currant juice and strawberries on to boil for thirty 
minutes, and stir carefully all the time. Then put in the sugar 
and boil up very quickly for twenty or twenty-five minutes 
removing any s(.-um that arises. Put into your jars, covering 
air tight. If a pound of sugar is used there will be more jelly. 

816. Apple Jam— Ingredients— Allow to every lb. of pared and cored 

fruit ^ lb. ot white sugar, the rind of i lemon and juice of half a 

lemon. 
Having peeled and cored the apples weigh them, and slice 
them very thin. Place in a stone jar and surround with boiling 
water, allow them to boil until tender ; wlien tender place in 
a preserving pan, add the sugar, grated lemon rind and juice. 
Boil slowly half an hour from the time it begins to simmer, 
remove the scum, put into jars and cover in the usual manner. 

817. Preserved Melons— Ingredients— Melon, salt and water, 
bc^t wiiile ginger to taste. To make syrup, I qt. of water to I \h. 
of white sugar, the rind of 3 lemons, another i lb. of sugar to each 
qt. of syrup. 

Take away the rind and seeds, and cut the melon about the 
size of pieces ofgmger. Put them in strong salt and water 
and let them remain for ten days, when it must be poured off, 
and fresh water put instead ; this must be changed twice daily 
for three or four days till all taste of salt is gone from the 
melon. Scrape the outside of the best white ginger (the 
quantity according to taste), put it into a thin syrup made of 
the above proportions of water and sugar, drain the fruit, and 
pour the syrup and ginger over it boiling hot. Repeat this for 
three days, then add another pound of sugar to each quart of 
syrup ; when boiled and skimmed add the rind of Ihree lemons, 
cut lengtiuvise, to each quart, put in the melons, and simmer 
until clear. After the first day's simmering the ginger may be 
sliced to impart more flavor, but it must not be allowed to boil. 
The syrup, when done, must be rich and thick. It is better 
when kept a year. 

818. To Preserve Citron— Ingredients— Citron, sugar and water. 
Purchase fine citrons, pare and slice one inch thick, cut

again into strips, remove the seeds, weigh and allow one pound 
of sugar to one pound of fruit. Make a syrup, say three 
pounds of sugar, three gills of water ; when boiling add the fruit 
and boil three-quarters of an hour, test if done hy piercing with 
a broom straw, and a few minutes before removing ironi the fire 
shoe and seed a lemon, and with one root of ginger put into 
preserving pan, pot and cover air tight. 

819. Preserved Pumpkins-IngrccHents— Equal nropo.-tlons ol 

sugar and pumpkin, i gill of leniun juice. 

Cut the pumpkin in two, peel and remove the seed, cut in 
pieces about the si/.e of a fifty-cent piece, after weighing place 
in a deep vessel in layers, first sprinkling a layer of sugar then 
of pumpkin and so on, until it is finished ; now add the lemon 
juice and set aside for three days ; now for every three pounds 
of sugar add three gills of water, and boil until tender. Pour 
into a pan, setting aside for six days, pour off the syrup and 
boil until thick, skim and add the pumpkin while boiling; 
bottle in the usual manner. 

820. Quinces Preserved Whole-Ingredients— Some rip- 

quinces, to every pint of water allow 3 lbs. of white sugar. 

Pare the quinces and put thcin into the preserving pan, 
three-parts covered with cold water (if they should float while 
the water is being poured on them, press them down with a 
plate until you have gauged the exact height of the water); 
take out the quinces, measure the water and add the sugar. 
Let this boil rapidly in the preserving pan for five minutes, and 
then put in the quinces. The syrup should not cover them at 
first, but when they are half-cooked it will then amply cover the 
fruit. Boil the quinces rapidly, until soft enough for a knitting- 
needle to pierce them easily, which should be in an hour and a 
half, reckoning from the first boiling up. Take the quinces 
out carefully, so as not to break them and lay them on dishes 
to cool. Run the syrup through a jelly bag or a piece of new 
Hinnel, put in a gravy strainer : this frees it of all odd little bits 
that may boil from the outside of the quinces, and makes it 
clearer. Put the syrup back in the preserving-pan, and boil it 
rapidly until it will jelly when dropped on a plate : put the 
qir.nces uito Ine boiling syrup, and let them simmer gently for 
ten minutes. Place each quince carefully in wide-necked Jars, 
pour the hot syrup over them, and when cold cover in the 
usual way.

821. Preserved Oranges— Inj^rcdients—Any nuh.ber of oranges, 
with rath'^r more than tlitir woiijht in sugar, allow rather more than 
half a pint of watci to each pound of sugar. 
Slightly grate and score the oranges round and round with 
a knife" l)ut not very deeply. Put them into cold water for 
three days, changing the water twice each day. Tie them up 
in a cloth and boil them until they are quite soft, that is, so.t 
enough to be penetrated by the head of a pin. While they ar . 
boiling place the sugar on the fire with the water, let it boil for 
a few minutes, then strain it through musl'n. Put the oranges 
into .he syrup and boil till it jellies and is of a yellow color. 
Try the syrup by putting some to cool, it should not be too 
stiff The syrup need not cover the oranges completely, but 
they must be turned so that each part gets thoroughly done 
Place the oranges in pots, cover with syrui), and tie down with 
brandied papers. This an excellent way of preserving oranges 
or shaddocks whole. Only they should be looked at now and 
then, and boiled up again in fresh syrup, if what they are in 
has become too hard, which, however, if they have been pro- 
perly done, will not be the case. They form a nice dish for 
dessert or for serving, filled with whipped cream or custard, 
either cold or gently warmed through in the syrup in astewpan. 
822. Quince Marmalade-Ingredients— Quinces, to every lb. of 
pulp allow 2 ll)s. of sugar. 
Rub off all the down from the quinces and cut off the tops 
and stalks. Put the quinces in a preserving pan with plenty of 
water and boil till they are soft ; then remove them from the 
fire, and pass the wlp through a hair sieve and beat it til it is 
soft and white ; piit the sugar on the fire with water, and let it 
boil till it is thick, and will fall from the spoon in flakes, corn- 
monly called feather point. Take the pan off the fire and mix 
in the pulp ; it is best to put a little of the sugar to the pulp, 
and keep on adding by degrees till it is tolerably thm, w.nen it 
will mix more readily with the larger quantity ot sugar : when 
all is weli mixed, return the pan to the fire and let the mixture 
get thoroughly warm, but do not allow it to Doil, and stir all 
the time or it will get burnt. Put the jam into jars and allow 
them to stand in the sun for two or three days, when there 
ought to be a thick crust on tac top.

the peel off in quarters, taking with it as much of the white 
skin as you can without breaking the pulp ; as you remove the 
peel put it into a basin of spring water ; put it all, when r^ady, 
into a sle-pan, witli enough spring water to cover the peel ; 
change the water .several times during the boiling process, and 
when the peel is quite soft and very tender, take it out of the 
oan and drain it on a hair sieve. Spread out the peel, when 
nearly dry, on a pasteboard, and cut it into fine shreds; squeeze 
the oranges and add the juice ot the lemons ; then add the 
sugar, allow to this amount of sugar the above proportion of 
water obtained by washing and straining the pulp of the 
oranges. Boil and skim carefully fifteen or twenty minutes, 
then add the washed pulp and juice, and boil for twenty or thirty 
minutes, or until it jellies properly. 

824. Preserved C^ab Apple— Ingredients — Apples, water. 
Purchase fine red Siberian crab apples, pick out those with 

the stems on, place in preserving pan just covering them with 
warm water, new simmer until the skin breaks, drain and with 
a small knife remove tl e cores. Allow a glass of water and 
one and a half pounds of sugar to each pound of fruit. Boil 
water and sugar until no scum appears, put in apples, cover and 
simmer until tender ; now take up the fruit, spread on dishes 
to cool. The syrup may be flavored with lemon. About three- 
quarters fill your jars w'th apples and then pour over syrup, 
allow to cool and then cover. 

825. Apple Marmalade — Ingredients — Some good cooking apples, 

i,^ lb. of fruit, }i teacupful of water to 6 lbs. of sugar, a few cloves, 
cinnamon or lemon peel for flavor. 

Peel, core and thinly slice the apples (apples that cook to 
a smooth pulp easily) ; put the sugar in a preserving pan (a tin 
or iron saucepan will turn them black), with the water ; let it 
gradually melt and boil it for ten minutes : then put in the 
sliced apple and a few cloves, cinnamon or lemon peel to flavor 
if liked. Boil rapidly for an hour, skim well and put in jam 
pots ; it should be quite a smooth pulp, clear and a bright 
amber color. Will keep good for twelve months.

Peel and slice the tomatoes, sticking into them the cloves ; 

put altogether into a stewpan and stew an hour. When done 

pack in glass jars and pour the syrup over boihng hot. 

827. Sweet Peach Pickle -Ingredients-To 4 lbs. of peaches 

allow 2 lbs. \v!i'-e sugar, >^ oz. each of mace, cinnamon and cloves 

mixed, and I i><.. of the best white vinegar. 

Pour scalding water over the peaches and remove the skins 
with a butter knife, drop into cold water, stick four cloves in 
each peach. Lay the peaches in preserving pan with the 
sugar sprinkled over them, bring gradually to the boil, add 
vinegar and spice, boil five or six minutes. Remove the peaches 
and place in bottles. Boil the syrup thick and pour over 
boiling hot. 
82 . To Keep Chestnuts (for winter use). 

Dry them after removing them from tlieir giccn husks; 
put in a box or barrel mixed with, and covered over by, fine 
and dry sand. Three gallons of sand to one gallon of chest- 
nuts. If there be maggots in any of the nuts they will come 
out and work up through the sand to get the air, and thus 
you have the chestnuts sweet, sound and fresh. 

829. To Keep Walnuts Fresh. 

Put a dessertspoonful r f salt into one quart of water. _ Put 
the nuts in and let them stand a day and a night, then with a 
clean cloth rub dry and store.

-^J CANNED FRUITS, Etc. $$ 



IS" 



CANNINCr FR. IT. 

830. Peaches (to can). 

First piei)are the syrup. For canned fruits, one quart of 
granulated sugar to two quarts of water is the proper propor- 
tion ; to be increased or lessened according to the quantity of 
fruit to be canned, but always f'icc as much water as su'Mr. 
Use a porcelain kettle, and, if possible, take care that it is kt'pt 
solely for canning and preserving - nothing else. Have another 
porcelain kettle by the side of t;ie first, for boiling water (about 
tiiree quarts). Put tlie peaches, a few at a time, into a wire 
basket, such as is used to cook asparagus, etc. See that it is 
perfectly clean and free from rust. Dip them, when in the bas- 
ket, into a pail of boiling water for a moment and transfer 
immediately into a pail of cold water. The skin will then at 
once peei offeasily, if not allowed to harden by waitincj. This, 
besides being a neat and expeditious way of peeiing'peacnes| 
also saves the best part of the fruit, which is so l»adly wasted 
in the usual mode of paring fruit. As soon as peeled, halve 
and drop the peaches nto boiling water, and let them simmer 
—not boil hard —till a silver fork can be passed through them 
easily. Then lift each half out separately with a wire spoon 
and fill the can made ready for use, pour in all the boiling 
syrup which the jar will hold, leave it a moment for the fruit 
to shrink while filling the next jar, then add as much more 
boiling syrup as the jar will hold, and cover and screw down 
tightly immediately. Continue in this wav, preparit-g and seal- 
ing only one jar at a time, until all is done. If any syrup is 
left over, add to it the water in which the peaches were sim- 
mered, asid a little more sugar, boil it down till it "ropes"

used up in this way very economically. Peaches to be peeled 
as directed above should not bo too green or too ripe, else, in 
the first place, the skin cannot be peeled o£f, or if too ripe, the 
fruit will fall to pieces. 

431. (Another way}. 

After peeling and halving as above directed, lay a clean towel 
or cloth in the bottom of a steamer over a kettle of boiling 
water and put the fruit on it, half filling the steamer. Cover 
tightly and let it steam while making the syrup. When that is 
ready, and the fruit steamed till a silver fork will pass through 
easily, dip each piece gently into the boiling syrup, then as gently 
place in the hot jar, and so continue till all have been thus 
scalded and put in the jar. Then fill full with syrup, cover and 
seal immmediately. While filling, be sure and keep the jars 
hot. 

832. (Another way). 

reel, halve, remove the stones, and prepare the syrup as 
directed, and when it is boiling drop in enough fruit for one 
jar, watch closely, and the instant they are sufficiently tender, 
take out each half with care and put into a hot jar till full. 
Tiien dip in all the boiling syrup it will hold. Cover tightly, 
set aside, and prepare for the next jar. Be sure and skim the 
syrup each time before adding more fruit. After jars are filled 
andth, covers screwed on, before setting them away, every 
little while give the screw another twist until it cannot be 
moved farther. 

833. Pears. 

The skin will not peel off so easily as the peach by dipping 
them hi boiling water, but it will loosen or soften enough to be 
taken off with less waste of the fruit than if pared without 
scalding. Prepare the syrup and proceed as for peaches. They 
will require longer cooking, but as soon as a silver or well- 
plated fork will pass through easily, they are done. Longer 
cooking destroys the flavor. 

834. Pineapples. 

Fare very carciuliy witu u t,ii\ci wi piatv-i n-u^iv, ec av^vi 
injures all fruit. With the sharp point of the knife dig out as 
near and with as little waste as possible, all the " eyes " and 
black specks, then cut out each of the sections iu which the

" eyes " were, in solid pieces clear down to the core. By doing 
tliis all the real fruit is saved, leaving the core a hard, round 
woody substance, hui it contains considerable juice. Take 
this core and wring it with the hands as one wrings a cloth, til! 
all the juice is extracted, then throw it away. Put the juice 
thus saved ir.to the s)ruo, let it boil up for five minutes, skim 
till clear, then add the fruit. Boil as short a time as possible, 
and have the flesh tender. The pineapple loses flavor by over- 
cooking more readily than any other fruit Fill into well- 
heated jars, add all the .syrup the jar will hold, cover and screw 
down as soon as possible. 

835 Plums. 

Plums should l)e wijjcd with a soft cloth or dusted, never 
w\-ished. Have the syruo all ready, prick each plum with a 
silver fork to prevent the skin from bursting, and put them into 
the syrup. Poil from eight to ten minutes, judging by the size 
of the fruit. Dip carefully into the hot jars, fill full, and screw 
on the cover immediately. Cherries may be put up in t'-.e 
same w^y.—BccchcK 



836. Pears (canned)— Ingredients— Bartlett pears, i qt. of fruit, I 

yi. of water, '/ Ih. of white sugar, 

Make the syrup and set on the stove to boil, peel the pears 
and plunge into cold water as soon as pared, when the syrup 
boils put the pears in, and boil until you can pierce them 
easily with a j)iece of broom straw, dip the cans in hot water, 
put in the fruit, pour boiling syrup over and seal. 

837. Plums (canned)— Ingredients— .Syrup, 2 wineglasses of water 

and ].( lb. of .sugar to each 3 qts. of fruit. 

When the sugar is incited and thv' water luke-warm put the 
plums in. Let it come slowly to the boil. Let them boil gently 
for five minutes. I'ut the plums into bottles, fill them with the 
boiling syrup (take care that there is as much syrup in the bot- 
tles as th' y will hold). Screv. up immediately and set in a dark 
dry place. 

S38. Strawberries (canned)— Ingredients— Allow to each I lb. 
oi fruit j^ i!>. uf ciUgar. 

Put berries and sugar into a large flat dish and allow t(» 
stand about four hours, then draw off the juice and put intc* 
preserving pan and allow to come to a boil, removing the scum

as it rises, lli>:ii put m the berries and let ll.ern come to a boil, 
tnit into warm bottle;- and seal <iuickly. 

8j9. OhorrlOS (cannecl)— Ingredients— To every i lb. of fruit >^ lb- 
of sugar, 3 gills of water. 
Put the sugar and water on the fire to heat, and as soon as 
it comes to a hail I'ut in the cherries and only allow them to 
scald for a quarter of an hour, put into bottles boiling hot and 
seal. A few of the kernels put in to scald with the fruit im- 
parts a fine flavor. Note— Be sure to skim well. 

840. To BottIO Frult-Ingrcdients-Any fresh fruil, large-mouthed 

Ijoltles, new corks. 

Secure the fruit not very ripe and picked on a fine day ; 
have the bottles clean and' dry, put in the fruit, cover with 
pieces of bladder tied securely, stand them in a l)oilor wi^h cold 
water to the necks, put the boiler on the fire and allow to boil ; 
as soon as the bladders begin to swell, pierce them with a large 
pin. Now let the fire out and allow the bottles to stand until 
cold. The following day remove the bladders and fill up the 
bott'es with sugar. Be careful to have the corks close at hand, 
and just before corking hold a couple of lighted matches in the 
mouth of the bottle, and before the gas has had time to escape, 
cork and cover witii resin. 

841. Qreen Gooseberries (• ■ bottle). 

lop and tail the goosebe i, and then fill wide mouthed 
bottles, shading them down till no mere can be put m ; then 
tie down with damp (not wet) blndder, and nlace the bottles, 
surroi! cd h hay, in a boiler of cold water, over a slow fire; 
let them simmer till reduced about one-third, then take the 
boiler off the fire and let the bottles remain in it till quite cold. 

842. Stone Fruits ( o bottle). 

For this purpose wide-necked glass bottles must be used. 
Fill them with the fruit, as closely packed as possible, and into 
the mouth of each put quarter pound <A finely powdered white 
sugar. Tie a piece of wet bladder, tightly stretched, oyer each 
mouth, to exclude the air. place them in a large fish kettle, 
mckma them with aav, which si ,uld surround each bottle, and 
line the sides of the kctti ^ prevent their either toucinng it or 
each other; this will prc.ent their breaking; fill the kettle 
with water, which must not come quite up to the bladder cov-

erings ; place it on the fire, or if a very hot one, to the side 
will be better, letting it simmer until you see that the fruit is 
cooked, by which time it will have considerably sunk in the 
bottles ; the kettle must then be removed from the fire, but the 
bottles must not be taken from it until the water is perfectly 
cold. During the time the kettle is on the fire, the bladders 
will require frequent moistening with a little water to prevent 
them from bursting ; should this happen, at once tie on a fresh 
piece of wet bladder. The bottles must be wiped dry alter 
removing from the water, and should be kept in a dry, cool 
place, rhe bladders must never be taken off till the fruit is 
required for use, as it will not keep after the bottle has been 
once opened. 

843. Syrup (I). 

Take of sugar ten pounds, water three pints. Dissolve the 
sugar in the water with a gentle heat. 

844. Syrup (2). 

In makmg syrups, for which neither the weight of the sugar 
nor the mode of dissolving it is specified, the following rule is 
to be observed : Take of refined sugar, reduced to a fine pow- 
der, twenty-nine ounces ; the liquor prescribed one pint. Add 
the sugar by degrees, and digest with a moderate heat, in a 
close vessel, until it is dissolved, frequently stirring it. set the 
solution aside for twenty-four hours, take off the scum, and 
pour off the syrup from the feces, if there be any.

OBSERVATIONS ON JELLIES. 

845. Fruit Jellies. 

The fruit should be placed in a jar, and the jar set in a 
stewpan of warm water, covered and allowed to boil until the 
fruit is broken ; take a strong jelly bag and press a little of the 
fruit at a time, turning out each tune the skms ; allow two 
pounds of sugar to one quart of juice, set on the stove to boil 
again Many good cooks heat the sugar by placing m the 
oven and stirring now and then to prevent burning. When the 
iuice begins to boil (watch that it does not boil over twenty-five 
minutes), then add the heated sugar, stir well and just bring to 
a boil remove directly from the stove, dip the vessels to con- 
tain it in hot water, and set them upon a dish cloth wrung out 
of warm water, pouring the boiling liquid into them, cover m 
the usual manner. 

846. Pineapple Jelly-Ingredients— A moderate-sized pineapple, 
I qt. of jelly. 
Peel the pineapple, halve lengthwise and cut into thin 
slices, infuse into the jelly the rind of the pineapple (well 
washed) and put first a layer of jelly, and when nearly set lay a 
border of pineapple over one upon another forming a rmg, and 
cover with jelly, and so on till all are used. 

8a7 Crab Apple Jelly— Ingredients— Some nice crab apples (Sibe- 
rian are Uie best for this purpose), i lb. of sugar to each pt. of juice. 
Cut the apples to pieces, neither paring nor seeding them, 
as the seeds give a very pleasant flavor to the jelly, put into a 
stone vessel and place 'in a pot of hot water, allow to boil eight 
or nine hours, cover the vessel (with the fruit in), tightly and 
leave all night ; next inorning squeeze out the juice, add the 
sugar hot in the above proportions, stirring rapidly all the time, 
allow it just to come to tiie boil and remove directly from the 
stove. Dip your jars in hot water and fill with the scaldmg 
jelly.

w^j TO MAKE BUTTER p^ 



Great attention and cleanliness are required in the manage- 
ment of milk. A cool and shaded cellar is a good place to 

IcGCO it 

Strain into shallow pans and allow to stand twelve hours, 
skim and let it stand another twelve hours for the second rismg, 
skim again and place the cream in the crock used for the pur- 
pose. Churn as soon as the cream thickens. 

The temperature of the cream should be 6o«P. \\e have 
used the Daisy churn and have found very little trouble m the 

^'°The motion must be regular, and as a rule the butter will 
appear in fifteen minutes. Take up with the butter skimmer 
and plunge in cold water. . 

Now draw off butter-milk from the churn and half fill with 
very cold water, put the butter in, close securely and give severa 
motions to wash it. Take it up and with the butter shovel 
press every drop of water from it. Set it by a few hours in a 
cool place and then work it again. If "O more water can be 
extracted proceed to salt (using only the finest salt) and by 
degrees add about a dessertspoonful to a pound. Mould into 
rolls or pats. 
863. Preserving Butter. 

Two pounds of common salt, one pound of loaf sugar, and 
one pound of saltpetre. Beat the whole well tof J^^;-. ^^e" 
to fourteen pounds of butter, put one pound of this mixture 
work it well, and when cold and firm put it into gla ed 
earthen vessels that will hold fourteen PO^^f ^ac^j'; Jf ,^^ 
thus preserved becomes better by being kept, but t rnust be 
kept from the air, and securely covered down. If ' "tended for 

winter use, add anotner ounce ui tuc mr.-.....e ,-- -vt-i^. ,

864 Cloutod Cream. 

In order to obtain this, the milk is suffered to stand in 
a vessel for twenty-four hours. It is then placed over a stove, 
or slow fire, and very gradually heated, to an almost simmer- 
ing state, below the boiling point. When this is accom- 
plished, (the first bubble having appeared^ the milk is removed 
from the fire, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours 
more. At the end of this time, the cream will have c isen 
to the surface in a thick or clouted state, and is removed. 
In this state it is eaten as a luxury ; but it is often converted 
mto butter, which is done by stirring it briskly with the hand 
or a stick. The butter thus made, although more in quantity, 
IS not equal in quality to that procured from the cream which 
has risen slowly and spontaneously ; and in the largest and 
best dairies, the cream is never clouted, except when intended 
for the table in that state. 

865. Rennet (to prepare). 

Take out the stomach of a calf just killed, and scour it well 
with salt and water, both inside and out ; let it drain and then 
sew it up with two large handfuls of salt in it, or keep it in the 
salt wet, and soak a piece in fresh water as it is required. 

866. Buttermilk. 

If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and most wholesome 
food. Those who can relish sour buttermilk, find it still more 
light and it is reckoned more beneficial in consumptive cases. 
Buttermilk, if not very sour, is also as good as cream to eat 
with fruit, if sweetened with white sugar, and mixed with a 
very little milk. It likewise does equally for cakes and rice- 
puddmgs, and, of course, it is economical to churn before the 
cream is to de for anything but to feed pigs. 

867. Cream (to Manage for Whey-Butter). 

Set the whey one dayand night, skim it, and so till you have 
enough; then boil it and pour it into a pan or two of cold 
water. As the cream rises, skim it till no more comes ; then 
churn it. W iiere ne-.v-mnk cheese is made daily, whey-butter 
for common and i)resent me may be made to advantage.

side of the fire so that it will keep blood warm ; put the rennet 
into it, too much will make the curd hard and the whey very 
salt; in a short time it will be separated into curd and whey, 
which cut into small pieces with a knife. Or, put in a small 
piece of alum, about the size of a nutmeg, into the milk, and 
let it boil. Strain the curd from the whey by means of a hair 
sieve, either let it drain, or press it dry ; pass the curd through 
the sieve by squeezing it into a basin. Melt the butter and

Boil the micaroni in the usual v/ay, and by the time it is 
sufficiently tender dissolve gently the cheese in the above 
quantity of crfaui, add a little salt and rather a full seasoning 
of cayenne. Now add tiic pounded mace and butter. The 
cheese should, in the first instanee, be sliced very thin, and 
taken quite free of the hard part adjoining the rind ; it should 
be stirred in tin" cream without iniermission until it is entirely 
dissolved and the whole is perfectly smooth ; the macaroni, 
previously well drained, may then be tossed gently in it, or 
after it is dished, tin; clieese may be poured equally over the 
macaroni. The whole, in either case, Kuy be thickly covered 
before it is sent to table, with fine crnmhs of bread fried of 
a pale gold color, and dried perfectly, either before the fire or 
in an oven, when such an addition is considered an improve- 
ment. As a matter of precaution, it is better to boil the cream 
before the cheese is melted in it ; rich white sauce, made not 
very thick, with an additional ounce or iwo of butter, may be 
used to vary and enrich this preparation. Do not use Paiu»s- 
sail cheese for this dish.

turc. Their eyes will ache from ihc very sameness, and they 
feel that it would jje a blessing to close them in utter oblivion. 
It ought to be not only a pleasure, but a stern duly for us to 
lighten their burdens and make life bearable to them." 

In preparing dishes for the siek, it is needful to combine the 
strongest nourishment vith the simi kst seasoiuig, as they re- 
quire food which will not need too much exertion of the diges- 
tive power. Sweet-breads broiled to a nice brown ; oysters 
roasted in the shell, or [plainly stewed ; clam broth, and even 
calves' brains, are highly recommended as articles of diet, 
which will give the most nutritious food in the smallest quan- 
tities. All kinds of gru<:l are impalatable to some \) rsons, but 
fortunately tastes differ, and there are those who will take with 
a decided relish large bowlfuls of Hour, oatmeal and even 
Indian meal j orridge. 

Never set before the sick a large quantity of food ; tempt 
with a very small portion delicately cooked and taslefullyserved. 
If not eaten directly, remove from .)e sick room without delay 
as no food should be allowed to stand there. Do not give the 
same food often, as variety is charming. Never keep the sick 
waiting, always have something in readiness— a little jelly, beef 
tea, stewed fruit, gru-l, etc. It will be found more tempting 
to serve any of these in glasses. If much milk is used keep it 
on ice. Let all invalid cookery be simple ; be careful to remove 
every particle of fat from broth or beef-tea before serving. 
The l)est diet for brain workers who take proper care of their 
health is brown bread, cream, fresh butter, oatmeal, fresh cheese 
(if it agrees), eggs, fish and a moderate amount of meat. Oysters 
may be used freely in their season, and fruits should not be 
omitted. There should be a variety and change as the season 
and health require. The diet should be varied in kind and 
form quite frequently, though not necessarily every day. Even 
in health, the best viands when continued from day to day 
become unpalatable, and even nauseous. An occasional change 
ofdiet, in short, is indispensable to a proper relish for food, and 
the maintenance of the appetite and good health. 

885. Chicken Milk— Ir.grcdicnts— Cliicken, heads of celery, a little 
iiarsley. 6 nopnercorns and a little .snlt. 

After carefully cleaning the chicken, skin and cut into small

a ql, of spring water, a little salt, I pt. oi boiling water. 
Remove all the fat from the veal, and simmer gently in the 
spring water till it is reduced to a pint ; blanch and pound the 
almonds till they are a smooth paste, then pour over them the 
boiling water very slowly, stirring all the time till it is ps 
smooth as milk ; strain both the almond and veal liquors 
through a fine o'-^ve and mix well together, and add the salt 
and boil up r gain. 

887. Chick" in tJrotf -Ingmli'-nts—An old fowl, 3 pts. of water, a

in a stcwpaii the above proportion of water, boil slowly (keep- 
ing well covered) one and a half hours, then add the tapioca, 
and boil half an hour longer. Some add with the tapioca a 
small piece of parsley, and a slice or two of onion ; strain be^ 
fore serving, seasoning slightly with pepper and salt. It is more 
strengthening to add, just before serving, a soft poached egg. 
Rice may be used instead of tapioca, straining the broth, and 
adding one or two tablespoc .is of rice (soaked for a short time), 
and then boiling half an hour. 

891. Beef Broth (2) -Ingredients— 1>< II). of finely minced beef, I qt.

small, in sufficient quantity to make the broth quite thick. 
The necessary vegetables are carrots, turnips, onions and cab- 
bage, but any others may be added; old (not parched) peas 
and celery are good additions. When the vegetables are boiled 
tender add the oatmeal to the broth, salt and pepper to taste. 
This very plain preparation is genuine Scotch broth as served 
in Scotland ; with any coloring or herbs, etc., added, it is not 
real Scotch broth. It is extremely palatable and wholesome in 
its plain form. 

803, Broths (Beef, Mutton and VeaB)— Ingredient.s— 2 lbs. of 

lean beef, i lb. scrag of veal, i lb. of scrag of mutton, some sweet 
herbs, lu peppercorns, 5 qts. of water, i onion.

than any form of cooked beef tea, and is the only sort that 
may at all tunes be safely given to very young infants. It has 
saved many lives, especially those of ricketty and washed chil- 
dren and typhoid patients, and it seems right that everyone 
should know how to set about making it. Dm, to return to 
our 

S97 Quickly Made Beef Tea. 

Take the above juice and meat together, and put it on a slow 
tire. J.et it boil for not longer than five minutes, strain it and 
It IS ready for use. If it has been carefully scraped there will 
be no fat upon it, but if there should ])e some it can easily be 
removed with paper. Salt must be added to taste. 
898. Another Quick IVlethod. 

Scrape the beef as before, and remember that it is useless to 
put in gristle or sinew, because in none of these quick methods 
IS there sufficient time to cook it. Set the meat over a very 
slow fire without water for a quarter of :in hour, then add warm 
water and simmer for half an hour or longer. 
^99- Beef Tea Custard. 

Thiii may be served alone either hot or cold, or a few small 
pieces can be put in a cup of beef tea, which is thus transferred 
into a kind of soii/e royule. Beat up an egg in a cup, add a 
small pinch of salt, and enough strong beef tea to half fill the 
cup; butter a tmy mould and pour in the mixture. Steam it 
tor twenty minutes, and turn it out in a shape. 

900. Savory Beef Tea-Ingredienls-3 lbs. of beef chopped up 

mely, 3 leeks, i onion with 6 cloves stuck into it, i small carrot, a 
little celery seed, a small bunch of herbs, consisting of thyme, mar- 
joram, and parsley, i teaspoonlul of salt, yi a teacupful of mushroom 
ketchup, and 3 pts. of water. 

Prepare according to the directions given in the first recipe. 

901. IVIush. 

Put some water or milk into a pot and bri' ■' it to boil then 
let the corn meal out of one hand gently into ihe milk or water 
and keep stirring with the other until you have got it into a 
pretty stiff state ; after which let it stand ten minutes or a 
quarter of an hour or less, or even only one imnute, and then 
tak.; It out, and i)ut it into a dish or bowl. This sort of half- 
pudding, half porridge, you eat either hot cr cold, with a little 



Mimiipm

^SS 



salt or without it. It is eaten without any liquid matter, but 
the general way is to have a basin of milk, and taking a lump 
of the inush you put it into the milk, and cat the two together. 
Here is an excellent pudding, whether eaten with milk or with- 
out it, whether you take it hot or cold. It is neither hard 
nor lumpy when cold, but quite light and digestible for the most 
feeble stomachs. 

902. Fowl (Sf:eweci in Barley)— Ingredients— l cliiclun, ji lb. of 
pearl barloy, enough milk lo cover the barley, only a lillle salt, a 
bunch of sweet herbs. 

Truss the chicken as for boiling ; place it in a stewpan with 
the well-washed barley ; sprinkle a little salt in and the sweet 
herbs ; enough milk to cover the barley ; put it on the fire, and 
let it stew very slowly, continue to add milk as it boils away, 
so that the barley may be always covered, but not the chicken, 
which should be dressed only by the steam from the milk. A 
small bird will take about three hours. When done serve with 
the milk ^nd barley round it. 



903. 



Vegetable Marrow (stuffed)— Ingredients— l marrow, 
some mince of either veal or chicken, bread crumbs, good gravy. 

Take a good sized marrow, boil until tender, halve length- 
ways ; remove the seeds, and fill the inside with hot mince ; 
join the two sides together, place upo*^ • hot dish, sprinkle with 
grated bread crumbs; set in the oven o own for a few min- 
utes. Serve with a boat of good gravy. 

904. Mutton Cutlets (delicate)— Ingredients— 2 or 3 small cut- 
lets from the best end of n neck or loin of mutton, I cupful of water 
or broth, a little salt and ;. lew peppercorns. 

Trim the cutlets very n\ct\y, cut off all the fat, place them 
in a flat dish with enough water or broth to cover them, add 
the salt and peppercorns and allow them to stew gently for two 
hours, carefully r.kimming off every particle of fat which may 
rise to the top during the process. At the end of this time, 
provided the cutlets have not been allowed to boil fast, 
they will be found extremely tender. Turn them when half 
done. 

Lambs' Fry (French)— Ingredients— 2 sets of lambs' fry, 2 
eggs, bread crumbs, chopped parsley, hot lard. 

Blanch the fry ten minutes in boiling water, drain them on a

them into bread crumbs, with which you have mixed some 
chop^)ed parsley, fry them in very hot lard of a nice hght brown 
color, dress pyramidically upon a napkin, garnish with fried 
parsley, and serve. 

906. Rabbit (stowed)— Ingredients— 2 nice young rabbits, I qt. of 
iiiilii, I labluspuonful of liuur, a blade of mace, salt and pepper. 

Mix into a smooth paste the flour with half a glass of milk, 
then add the rest of the milk ; cut the rabbits up into conven- 
ient pieces ; pb.ce in a stewpan with the other ingredients and 
simmer gently until perfectly tender. 

907 Sweetbreads. 

These, when plainly cooked, are well adapted for the conval- 
escent. They should be slowly boiled, and very moderately 
seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper. 

908 Pork Jeiiy (Dr. RatclifFe's Restorative)-Ingredierts 

—A leg of well-fed pork, 3 gals, of water, Yz oz. of mace, the same 
of nutmeg, salt to taste. 

Take the pork just as cut up, beat it, and break the bone. 
Set it over a gentle fire with the water and simmer until it is 
reduced to one gallon. Let the mace and nutmeg stew with it. 
Strain through a fine sieve. \Mien cold take off the fat. Give 
a large cupful the first and last thing and at noon, putting salt 
to taste. 

909 Shank Jelly— Ingredients— 12 shanks of mutton, 3 blades of 

mace, an onion, 20 Jamaica, and 30 or 40 black peppers, a bunch of 
herbs, a crust of bread toasted brown, and 3 qts. of water. 

Soak the shanks for four hours, then brush and scour them 
very clean. Lay in a saucepan with all the ingredients, pour- 
ing in the water last, and set them near the stove; let them 
simmer as gently as possible for five hours, then strain and 
jtlace in a cool place. This may have the addition of a pound 
of beef, if approved, for flavor. It is a remarkably good thing 
for persons who are weak. 

910. Arrowroot Jelly-Ingredients— >i pt, of water, grated nutmeg, 

.-.nd fm." '-';gr,r, dc"sert=poonful of arrowroot rubbed smooth in 2 
spoonfuls of cold water.

in by degrees the arrowroot; then return the whole into the 
saucepan ; stir and boil it three minutes. 



911. Tapioca i"r 

some lemon j'li 



■_T;;f;redients— Some of largest kind of tapioca, 
nirl sugnr. 

Pour cold water on to wash it two or three times, then soak 
It in fresh water fi\c cr ;ix hours, and sinuner it in the some 
until quite clear ; then add the lemon juice and sugar. Ti^e 
peel should have been boiled in it. It thickens very much. 

912. Meat Jelly— Ingredients -Beef, isinglass, i leacupful of water, 
salt to taste. 
Cut some beef into very small pieces and carefully remove 
all the fat. Put it in an earthen jar with alternate layers of 
the best isinglass (it is more digestible than gelatine) until the 
jar is full. Then add a teacupful of water with a little salt, 
cover it down closely, and cook it all day in a very slow oven. 
In the morning scakl a jelly mould and strain the heiuidinto it. 
It will be quite clear, except at the bottom, where will be the 
brown sediment such as is in all beef tea, and k will turn out 
in a shape. It is, of course, intended to be eaten cold, and is 
very useful in cases where hot food is forbidden, or as a variety 
from the usual diet.

toast. 

Stir the oatmeal and water together, let it stand to be clear, 
and, pour off the latter ; pour fresh upon it, stir it well, let it 
stand till next day ; strain through a fine sieve, and boil the 
water, adding the milk while doing. The pro[)ortion of water 
must be small. This is much ordered, with toast, for the break- 
fast of weak persons, abroad. 

924. Ground Rice WlUk. — Ingredients — One tablespoonful of 

ground rice rubbed smooth in i^ pts. of milk, a piece of cinnamon, 
lemon peel and nutmeg. 

Boil the ground rice and milk, adding the spices and flavor- 
ing. Sweeten to taste when nearly done. 

925. Sago Milk. — Ingredients — Sago, new milk. 

Cleanse the sago from the earthy taste by soaking it in cold 
water for an hour, pour that off and wash well, then add more, 
.md simmer gendy with the miik. It swells so much that a 
small quantity will be sufficient for a quart, when done reduce 
to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flavoring. 

926. Eggs and Top.st.— Ingredients— 2 eggs, thinly cut slices of 

bread, i tcaspoonful of vinegar, little salt, a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut, a lew sprigs of fresh, green parsley or some sweet ger- 
anium leaves. 

Take the thinly-cut slices of bread, and toast them quickly 
to a light brown, without burning them. Drop an egg or two 
into boiling water into which the vinegar has been poured, and 
a little salt added to it. Pour one tablespoonful of boiling water 
over apiece of butter, turn it over the toast, and if it is very dry 
dip the whole of it into the melted butter and water, soaking 
the crusts completely. Skim out the eggs as soon as the 
whites are firmly set and put them upon the toast. Edge the 
plate with a few sprigs of fresh, green parsley, or some sweet

beating while you moisten the batter gradually with milk. Be 
careful to leave no lumps in the l)atter. Lastly, stir in the 
whites and bake in a buttered pudding dish until light, firm and 
delicately browned. It may be eaten as a dessert, but it is a 
delightful article, and the best substitute that can be devised 
for green corn pudding. 

928. Strawberries— Ingredients— Fruit, white sugar, juice of 2 or 3 

lemons in proportion to the fruit. 
The way to moke strawberries digestible to those who are 
unable to eat them on account of dyspepsia or any other cause 
is very simple. Cover them with a very large allowance of 
powdered sugar and then squeeze over them the lemon juice, 
which brings out the strawberry flavor more than anything else, 
and its acidity is counteracted by the large quantity of sugar. 
The lemon juice should be in the same proportion as the cream 
would be in the place of which it is used. 

929. StrengtheningBlanc-Mange— Ingredients— I pt. milk, 

y^ oz. isinglass, rind (if>2 fi small lemon, 2 oz. of sugar, yolks of 3

of the eggs; pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and hold 
it over the fire, keeping it stirred until it begins to thicken ; put 
it into a deep basin and keep it moved with a spoon until it is 
nearly cold, then pour it into the molds which have been laid 
in cold water, and set it in a cool place till firm. This we can 
recommend for invalids, as well as for the table generally. 

930. Water Gruel.— Ingredients— A large spoonful of oatmeal, water, 

salt and a little piece of butter. 
Rub smooth the oatmeal with two spoonfuls of water and 
pour it into a pint of water boiling on the fire; stir well and boil

and butter when eaten ; stir until the butter is thoroughly in- 
corporated.

allowing two quarts of water to one quart of hominy, and boil 
it slowly four or five hours, or until it is perfectly tender ; then 
drain it, put it into a deep dish, add salt and a piece of butter 
and serve as a vegetable with meat. 

934. Hominy (2). 

Put some water on the fire, and when it boils add a little 
salt ; drop in gradually the hominy, and boil fifteen to twenty 
minutes, stirring well all the time with a wooden spoon ; 
serve with milk or cream. If preferred it may be boiled in 
milk in the sime way. It also makes excellent puddings cook- 
ed in the same way as rice or tapioca, but it shou'd be well 
soaked before cooking ; it may also be forn'.ed into shapes and 
served with jam or custard. 

935- Egg Gruel.— Ingredients— Yolk of one egg, I tablespoonful of 
sugar, 73 of a cupful of boiling water, white of the egg.

^1 THe DOCTOR lo^ 



The following receipts are selected from eminent authori- 
ties andean be relied upon, but while in all cases it is prudent 
to con^mlt a medical man as soon as possible, the information 
under this heading will be found invaluable where the doctor is 
not readily available. 



956. A Medicine Box. 

Secure a deep cheese box, line it inside with dark cambric 
or cotton ; put pockets all around the inside about two inches 
from the top and let them extend very nearly to the bottom. 
In these pockets place white cotton, a sponge, safety pins, a spool 
of white silk, fingers from old kid gloves, court plaster, rolls 
of bandages, all sizes, mustard, vaseline, chloroform, sweet oil, 
bottle of arnica, saleratus and a bottle of good liniment. Ha^ >-. 
some uncleaned sheep's wool to use for smoking painiai 
wounds, Putin everything th..t could be needed in any case of 
sudden illness or accident, in the body of the box put old linen, 
flannels, or old cotton cloths, so useful in sickness. Cover 
the top of the box with a cushion and tack a frill around the 
edge. Cover the box with the same material put on in box 
pleats. One of these boxes should be found in every house- 
hold. 

957. Fractures. 
A fracture is said to be simple when there is no externa, 
wound ; compound, when complicated with lesion of the sur- 
roundmg soft parts ; and comminuted when the bone is broken 
into mnny fragments. The syiiiptoms of fracture are pain and 
inability to move the limb. When there is great swelling, it is 
often difficult to ascertain the nature or even the existence of a 

266

267 



fracture The course of a MUiple fracture is a painful and in- 
ntmed swelling for a few dnys after the accident with more or 
TeS^Jebe reaction ; these gradually subside, and wUh prober 
reatmcnt the bone uni.cs in from one to two mon .s, with or 
Uhout deformity according to circumstances not always under 
the control of the surgeon. Complicated fractures often ter- 
minate in the death of portions c,f bone and of the soft parts m 
u healthy abscesses and tetanus, leading prehaps to fatal results 
units the limb be removed. The indications of treatment are 
^o reduce or set the fragments and keep them at r.st and m 
dose contact so as to prevent deformity ; all disturbing mus- 
c esmustbe relaxed, the ends of the bones extended and the 
narts property supported and kept in place, the hmb bandaged 
and son e kind of spUnt is applied to keep it immovable of its 
nafual ength. The variety of bandage, splints and apparatus 
^orS different kinds of fracture is very great, and in nothing 
does Lnerican surgery stand more pre-eminent than m its in- 
fen ou and effectual instruments for the treatment o broken 
Ws When a surgeon cannot be procured immed.ntely the 
bXn limb should be kept as nearty as possible in its natural 
oo^tLn The two portions of the bone must be pulled in op- 
^oite directions, until the limb is of the same length as its 
feUow, then apply a splint and bind it to the part with a band- 
lee Of course wheri there is n... deformity the puhngofthe 
bones is unnecessary. Should there be much swelling a cold 
S should be used. If the patient is faint give brandy and 
water, or sal-volatile and water. 

958 How to Restore a Person apparently Drowned. 
Loosen everything around the neck. Turn the patients 
face downward, and raise the body several inches higher han 
behead and keep it in this position long enough to count five 
sL^y T is will enable the water to escape from t - mouth 
and nose Place the patient on his back with the chest shght-

then out. While this is going on let another person catch 
hold of the tongue with a piece of cloth and pull it out, it 
maybe secured by fastening an elastic band over the tongue 
and under the chin ; this opens the little air-valve, covering 
the air tube. While this is going on remove all wet clothing, 
cover the body with warm blankets, etc., and rub the body 
vigorously. If signs of life appear, place the patient in a warm 
bed in a well-ventilated room, and give hot drinks, such as 
milk, tea or coffee. 

959 Scalds and Burns. 

The first object is to cover the injured part with some suit- 
able material, and this should he kept on until the cure is 
complete. Apply to the burn or scald a mixture of lime water 
and linseed oil by saturating the lint with the mixure. Do not 
remove when dry, but saturate by the application of fresh outer 
layers from time to time. If nothing better is at hand apply 
grated potato, flour, starch, etc. 

960. Bruises. 

Excite as quickly as possible, the absorption of bruised blood 
and ap])ly butter, fresh raw beef, or even bathing with cold 
water is a very good though simple remedy. 

961. Hemorrhage 

may be checked by giving strong salt and water ; or by giving 
lemon juice. 

If an artery be cut, tie a string above the out to prevent 
the escape of blood. Tighten the string if necessary by placing 
a ruler or stick in the string, twist this around, so as to make a 
knot pressing tightly on the artery. The blood from an artery 
is always of a very bright red and comes out in jets or spurts. 

962. To Remove a Bee Stingy. 

Remove the sting at once with a needle or the fingers ; 
place a key tightly over the stung part, the pressure will force 
the poison out. Wipe the place with clean linen, suck it and 
then dab with the blue-bag. 

qf>i, E!it@s O'f Snaikes. 

These are dangerous and require powerful remedies. The 
bites of the various kinds of snakes do not have the same effects

but people suffer from them in different ways. It is of the 
greatest importance to prevent the poison mixmg with the 
blood and to remove the whole of it instantly from the body. 
Take a piece of tape or anything that is near and tie tightly 
around the bitten part ; if it be the leg or arm, immediately 
above the bite and betvveen it and the heart, the wound should 
be sucked several times by any person near There is no 
dan-er to the person performing this act of kindness providing 
his tongue or any part of his mouth has no broken skin. Hav- 
ing sucked the poison immediately spit it out. A better plan 
is to cutout the central part bitten with a sharp instrument. 
This may not be a very pleasant operation for an amateur, biit 
as we have to act promptly in such an emergency, courage will 
come. After the operation bathe the wound for some 
time to make it bleed freely. Having done thi^s rub the wound 
with a r,tick of lunar caustic, or still better, a solution composed 
of cixty grains of lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of water. 
This solution should be dropped into the wound,. Of course 
the band tied round the wound in the firrl place must be kept 
on during the time these means are being adopted. Ihe 
wound afterwards must be covered with lint dipped m cold 
water There is generally great depression of strength m these 
cases, it is necessary therefore to give some stimulant a glass of 
hot brandy and water, or twenty drops of sal-volat le. W hen 
the patient has somewhat recovered give him a little mustard 
in hot water to make him vomit, if on the other hand the 
vomiting is continuous, a large mustard poultice should be ..p- 
plied to the stomach and one pill given composed of a gram 
of solid opium. Note-Only one of these pills must be given 
without medical advice. 

All these remedies can be acted upon until a surgeon 

'''"''^^ 964. Bites of Does. 

The manner of treatment is the same as for snake bites. 
Many writers on the subject are in favor of the wouud bemg 
kept open as long as possible. Many persons do this by placing 
aTew beans on the wound and then putting a linseed meal 
poultice over the wound.

in a bath at the heat of xoo'^', after which leeches should 
be applied, and then a poukice of vinegar and bran, lukewarm, 
or bread crumbs and camp!)uraled spirits of wine; the follow- 
ing lotion, when applied iu the early stage, after blood has 
been freely drawn by leeches, rarely fails in affording great 
relief; Gourland's extract, half a:i ounce; tincture of opium, 
two drachms ; vinegar, half a pint ; camphor mixture, one pint 
and a half. Mix for a lotion, to 1 e applied tepid by means 
of folded rags. Aficr the inflammatory action has subsided 
one of the following Lmimcnis should be used: 

966. (i) Soap liniment, one ounce; tincture of opium, two 
drachms ; camphorated spirits, two drachms. Mix for a lini- 
ment, and rub in night and morning. 

967. (2) Camphorated spirits of wine, half an ounce; caji- 
put oil and laudanum, of each, two drachms ; olive oil, half an

ounce. Mix for a liniment, and use as above.

cold water on the part every morning, aided by a bandage 0° 
laced stocking to support the part, will be the most effectual 
means of remedying ii. 

970. For Sprained Ankle— Bathe the ankle frequently 
with strong cold salt and water; sit with the foot elevated, keeping 
it cool. Diet, and take daily cooling drinks or medicine. Oj 
bind on loosely, and as often as dry, first twenty-four hours, 
cotton-batting, spread with beaten egg-whites; after that, 
morning and night. 



971 To Bind a Sprained Ankle— Put the end of the 

bandage upon the instep ; then take it round and bring it over 
the same part again, and then round the foot two or ih'-ee 
times ; finish off with a turn or two round the leg above the 
ankle. 



972. Sprained Wrist—Begin by passing the bandag,; 
roun-u the hand, across and across, like the figure eight ; i(i.ive 
out tlie thumb, and finish with a turn or two round ihcj v rist. 
Apply arnica tincture.

Treatment ©f a Frozen Person. 



Chdius, a German authority, gives tlie following advice for 
restoring a frozen person : He J^'iould be brought into a cold 
room, and nftcr having been undressed, covered up with snow 
or wi.i cb.h in ice-cold water, or he may be laid m co.a water 
so deoly, that his mouth and nose only are free. U hen tlie 
body is somewhat thawed, there is commonly a sort of icy 
crut f>rmed around it; the patient must then be removed, 
and the body washed with cold water mixed with a little wine 
or braiidy ; when the limbs lose their stiffness, and the frozen 
person shows signs of life, he sliould be carefully dried, and 
put into a cold bed in a cold room : scents and remedies which 
exc'te sneezing, are to be put to his nose ; air to be carefully 
blown into the lungs, if natural breathing does not come on ; 
clysters of warm water with camphorated vinegar thrown up; 
th- tlKoat tickled with a feather, and cold water dashed upon 
the pit of the stomach. He must be brought by degrees into 
rather warmer air, and mild pcrspirants, as elder and balm-tea 
(or weak common tea) with Minderin's spirit, warm wine and 
the like, may be given to promote gentle perspiration. 

974. Bruises. 
In slight bruises, and those that are not likely to be followed 
by inflammation, nothing more is usually required than to 
bathe the part with spirit, as" Eau-de-Cologne, brandy, etc., 
mixed with an equal proportion of vinegar and water, 

07 q In more severe cases, and where the accident is r7ear 
an important part, as the eye, or any of the joints, it becomes a 
desirable object to prevent the approach of inflammation. I'or 
this purpose leeches must be employed, repeating them accord- 
ing to circumstances. 

976. In cb. last stage of a bruise, where there is merely a 
want of tone in the parts, and swelling from the effused blood, 
Ttc fricticn should be employed, cither simply, or with any 
common l.niment. Wearing a bandage-pumping cold water 
on the part, succeeded by warm friction -a saturated solution 
f ."-.i^^n --ii^ 'n «^^f^r. have each been found successful. 
lLroo;rof^brionya"nd 'Solomon's seal, bruised and applied 
as a poultice, are highly useful in hastening the disappearance 
of the discoloration caused by the bruises.

977. Acciden-t3 from Ed^c Tools, Hard Bodies, &c 

In all recent wounds, the first consideration is to remove 
foreign bodies, such as pieces of glass, splinters of wood, pieces 
of stone, earth, or any other substance tb.at may have been 
introduced by the violence of the act which caused the wound. 

Where there is much loss of blood, an attempt should be 
made to stop it with dry lint, and compression above the part 
wounded, if the blood be of a florid color, and below, if of a 
dark color. In proportion to the importance of the part 
wounded, will be the degree of the discharge of blood, and the 
subsequent tendency to inflammation and its consequences. 

978. Substances in the Eye 

A substance getting in the eye may either lie disengaged 
on its surface, or, having penetrated the external coat, may 
there remain fixed. In the former casL it is easily removed liy 
a camel-hair pencil or a piece of paper rolled into the size of a 
crow quill with the end softened in the mouth. 

979. Sometimes the substance sticks in tlic corner, when, 
if it cannot be removed with a probe or fine forceps, the point 
of a lancet should be carefully passed under it so as to lift it 
out. 

980. If the removal cannot be effected without consider- 
able difficulty, it is better to leave it to be detached by ulcera- 
tion, taking every precaution to keep off undue inflammation, 
by avoiding a strong light, fomenting with warm water, etc. 

981. To remove fine particles of gravel, lime, etc., the eye 
should be syringed with luke-warm water till free from them. 
Be particular not to worry the eye under the impression that the 
substance is still there, which the er.largoment of some of the 
minute vessels makes the patient believe to be actually the 
case 

982. Substances in tlie Ear. 

983. Hard substances, such as peas, bits of slate pencil, 
beads, etc., occasionally get lodged in the passage of the ex- 
ternal ear. If the substance be within sight, and can be grasped 
readily with a small pair of forceps, that will be the best way 
to extract it ; but force must no« on any account be used. 

984. But the best and safest plan is to inject luke-warm 
water rather forcibly into the ear by means of a syringe, one

affections of the bowels, like some affections of the head, are 
unattended by aa^te pain or tenderness ; their accession, on the 
contrary, is msidious, and it will require great attention to detect 
them early.

Domeslio treatment should never be trusted in such terriM-.* 
affections as these, not a moment should be loiit in sending Li 
the n;cdicai man. 

If anything may be done in the meantime, it is — i, in either 
of the two former cases to lance the gums ; 2, to evacuate the 
bowels by the warm water injection, made niore active by the 
addition of Brown Sugar ; 3, and then to administer the wariii 
bath. An important point, never to be forgotten in the hurry 
of these cases, is to reserve the evacuations for inspection, 
otherwise the physician wi.l be deprived of a very important 
source of judgment. 

Inccse of fits arising plainly from exhaustion, there need 
be no hesitation in giving five drops of sal volatile in water, 
light nourishment may be added ; the feet must be fomented 
and the recumbent posture preserved. 

In fits arising from an affection of the heart the symptom in 
urgent difficulty of breathing ; the child seems as if it would 
lose its breath and expire. In such a case, I'o do noihing is the 
best course; all self-possession must be summoned, and the 
infant kept perfectly quiet. Every change of posture, every 
effort, is attended with danger. 

Sometimes the attacks assume the character of croup ; 
there is a crowing cough, and breathing ; or there is a difficulty 
of breathing, and then a crowing inspiration. The former case 
is generally croup ; the latter is, in reality, a fit dependent on 
the morbid condition of the brain or spinal marrow, althoiJgh 
it takes the appearance of an affection of the organs of respira- 
tion. 

In either case it is well to clear the bowels by means of the 
slow injection of from a quarter tn half a pint of warm water, 
with or without brown sugar ; indeed, this is the most gener- 
ally and promptly useful of all our reiiiedies in infantile dis- 
eases. To this ♦he wa^m bath may always be added, if admin- 
istered with due caution. For mstance, it should not be 
continued so as to induce much flushing or paleness of the 
countenance.

993. Measles. 
Measles commences with the ordinary symptoms of fever. 
The attack is almost invariably attended with inflammation of 
the mucous membrane lining the air pa; ,ages ; the eyes are 
red and watery ; there is defluxion from the -ostnls, hoarse- 
ness and cough. The eruption commonly . I'cars on the 
fourth day, at first about the head and neck, taen the trunk 
and arms, and finally reaching the lower extremities ; it takes 
two or three days to complete its course, and when it reaches 
the feet and legs has often begun to disappear from the face. 
All ages are liable to it. When the eruption is fuUv out, the 
cough, at first dry and troublesome, generally bccom. s softer 
and less frequent, and at the end of six or se\ a da) ; from the 
coming out of the first papules they have disappe: red. U hen 
danger occurs, it is from innummation of the air passages. In 
all ordinary cases simple diet, the maintenance of an equable 
temperature, plenty of diluent drinks, attention should be paid 
to the i)o\vels, as they should be kept gently open ; it a roasted 
apple or a little manna in the drink will not do this, give .. 
mild saline aperient such as ipecacuanha wine and sweet 
spirits of nitre, I drachm; of tartrate of potash, 4 drachms; 
solution of acetate of ammonia, i ounce ; syrup of poppies, 2 
drachms ; cinnamon or dill water sufficient to make 4 oui. es ; 
dos?-, a table or dessert spoonful three or four times a day. 
Vv'!i<-rc there is much heat ol the skin, sponging with tep:d 
vi(;':n>r and water will commonly relieve it, and also the it h- 
irt'-, ' On the third or fourth day after the subsidence of the 
eruotion a little opening medicine should be given and care 
must betaken to protect the patient against change of weather, 
and to restore the strength by a nourishing diet. Attention 
should be paid to the cough, and the proper remedies given it 
required. Should the eruption suddenly disappear, then_ there 
is cause for alarm ; the patient should be directly put into a 
warm bath, and have warm diluent drinks ; if the pulse sinks 
rapidly, administer wine whey or weak brandy and water. 

994. Scarlet Fever. 

This fever is distinguished froni other eruptive fevers oy the 
fact of the eruption being an exanthema, an efflorescence, or a 
rash, these terms not being strictly applicable to vesicles and 
pustules. The disease sometimes commences with a chill, and

fever is higlily cor.lagious, and the iiifecti>)us material remains 
for a long time in garnunts, etc. Children are more suscep 
tible than adults. The treatment in mild cases is very simple. 
Active nied 'cation is not indicated. It suflices to diminish the 
animal heat by sponging the body and giving cooling drinks, 
observing proper l.ygienic precautions. Smearing the ..urface 
of the limbs with fat bacon allays the itching, which is often 
very distressing. Should the symptoms show failure of the 
vital powers, supporting measures of treatment (alcoholic 
stimuUnts and alimentation) are indir ited. Great care must 
be taken to keep the patient warm right through the disease, 
as affections of the kidneys often follow cases of scarlet fever. 
It is important to isolate the patient and attendant from the 
healthy. Remove all curtains and carpets, and clothing not 
actually in use from the sick chamber. On removing the 
patient's linen or bed-clolhcs, throw them into water and so 
convey to the wash. Ct ioride of lime should be set about the 
room in plates. When the patient can be removed from the 
room, sciub the room with chloride of lime in the water. It 
is wise to keep the ^atient in bed for three weeks. Should the 
eruption be slow in appearing, sponge the body with cold vine- 
gar and water, wrap in a blanket and keep the patient warm. 
Should the throat be sore, keep hot bran poultice constantly 
applied. If the fever runs high in the first stage, and there is

great inclination to vouiit ('.tforo spongin-), it is a good plan 
to give an emetic of equal proportions of antiaionial and ipe- 
cacuanha wine ; dose, a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful, accord- 
ing to age. 

995. Hooping: Couffh, 

This wcll-kiHAvn disease is chiefly, hut not wholly, confined 
to the stages of infancy, and it occurs but once in a life-time. 
It may be described as spasmodic catarrh, and its i;everity 
varies greatly ; sometimes being so mild as to be s-carcely 
known from a common cough, at others, exhibiting the most 
distressing symptoms, and frequently causing death' by its vio- 
lent and exhausting paroxysms. 

The first symptoms of this cougli are those of an ordinary 
cold ; there is pr.:.bably restleh\^,ness and slight fever, with irri- 
tation in the bronciii.il passages: this goes on gradually 
increasing in intensity for a week or ten days, and then begins 
to assume the spasmodic character; at first the paroxysms are 
slight, and of short duration, witli a scarcely perceptible 
" hoop," but soon they become more frequent and severe ; a 
succession of violent expulsive coughs is followed by a long- 
drawn inspiration, in the course of which the peculiar sound 
which gives a name to the disease is emitted ; agnin come the 
coughs, and again the inspiration, following each ether in 
quick succession, nntil the sufferer, whose starting eyes, livid 
face, swollen veins, and clutching hands, attest the violence of 
tlie struggle for breath, is relieved by an expectoration of 
phlegm resembling the white of an egg, or by vomiting. When 
the paroxysm is over, the child generally resumes its play, or 
other occupation, and frequently complains of being hungry. 
As_ the disease proceeds, the matter expectorated becomes 
thicker, and is more easily got rid of, and this is a sign of favor- 
able progress : the spasmodic paroxysms ])ccome less frequent 
and violent, and gradually cease altogether ; but the changes 
here indicated may extend over a month or six months, accord- 
ing to circumstances, the season of the year having much 
influence in hastening or retarding them, summer being, of 
course, the most favurable time. It is a common impression 
that, at whatever time of year an attack of Hooping Cou^^h 
commences, it will not end until May; this is simply" because 
of the change in the weather which generally takes place in or

about the course of that monlli. With a strong, healthy child 
(when proper care is taken), there is little to apprehend from 
this disease, provided it be not complicated with others, such 
as inflnmmation of the lungs, or any head affection producing 
convulsions ; it then proves a most dangerous malady, and is 
fatal to many. With children of a full habit, the fits of cough- 
ing often cause bleeding at the nose, but this should not be 
viewed with alarm, as it relieves the vessels of the brain, and 
if, likely to prevent worse consequences. 

To weakly children Hooping Cough is a very serious malady 
—to all it is frequently a very sore trial, but to them it is 
especially so : therefore great care should be taken not to 
expose them to the danger of catching it ; that it is contagious 
there can be no doubt, and although some parents think lightly 
of it, and imagining their children must have it, at one time or 
another, deem that it matters little when, and therefore take 
no pains to protect them against it, yet we would impress 
upon all our readers, who may have the care of infants, that a 
heavy responsibility lies at their door. It is by no means cer- 
tain that a child will have this disease ; we have known many 
persons who have reached a good old age and never contracted 
it ; and 't is folly and wickedness needlessly to expo.'.e those 
placed under our care to a certain danger. 

Like fever, Hooping Cough has a course to run, which n( 
remedies, w'th which we are at present acquainted, will 
shorten ; the severity of the symptoms may be somewhat miti- 
gated, and we may, by watching the course of the disease, and 
by use of the proper means, often prevent those complications 
which render it dangerous, and this brings us to the con.sidera- 
tion of the proper mode of 

Treatment. — The first effort should be directed to check any 
tendency to inflammation which may show itself; to palliate 
urgent symptoms, and stop the spasm which is so distressing a 
feature of the case. To tliis end, the di( t must be of the sim- 
plest kind, consisting for the most part of milk and farinaceous 
puddings ; if animal food, it must not be solid, but in the form 
of Broth, or Beef-tea ; roasted Apples are good ; and, for 
drinks, Milk and Water, Barley-water, Weak Tea, or Whey. 

Care must be taken to keep liie bowels open viiih some 
gentle aperient, such as Rhubarb and Magnesia, with now and 
then a grain of Calomel or Compound Julep Powder, if some-

thing stronger is required. An unetic sliould be giver, about 
twice a week, to get rid of the pldegn") — it may be Ipecacuanha 
Wine or the Powder. To reheve the coug!), the following 
mixture v.ill bo found effjctivc : -Ii)ecacuanha Powder, lo 
grains; Bicarbonate of Potash, i drachm; Liquor of Acetate 
of Ammonia, 2 ounces ; Essence of Cinnamon, 8 drops ; 
Water, 6)4 ounces ; Dose, a tablespoonful about every four 
hours. 

For night restlessness, 2 or 3 grains of Dover's Powders, 
taken at bed-time, are good; this is the dose for a child of three 
years of age. Mustard poultices to the throat, the chest, and be- 
tween the rhoulders, are often found beneficial. Roadie's 
E»ibn)cati<>7i is a favorite application, and a V'.ry good one ; it 
is composed as follows : — Oil of Amber and of Cloves, of each 
Yz an ounce ; Oil of Olives, i ounce; a little Laudanum is, 
perhaps, an improvement. This may be rubl.'cd on tl.e belly 
when it is sore from coughing. Difficulty of breathirg may be 
sometimes relieved by the vapor of Ether or Turpentine dif- 
fused through the apartment. In the latter stages of the dis- 
ease, tonics are generally advisable. Steel Wine, about 20 
drops, with 2 grains of Sesquicarbonate of Ammonia, and 5 
drops of Tincture of Conium, in a tablespoonful of Cinnamon 
Water, sweetened with Syrup, is a good form ; but a change of 
air, with a return to a generous diet, are the most effectual 
means of restoration to health and strength. 

995. Diarrhoea— (Greek reo, to flow). 

Looseness of the bowels, sometimes called Flux. This is 
a very common disorder, arising from a variety of causes, fore- 
most among which may be mentioned supprcr K-rspiration, 
a sudden chill or cold ap{;lied to the body, a ..-uits, or any 
indigestible food, oily or putrid sui stances, deficiency of bile, 
increased secretion of mucus, worms, strong purgative medi- 
cines, gout or rheumatism turned inwards, etc. Hence diarrhoea 
may be distinguished as bilious^ aiucous, licnitery (where the 
food passes unchanged), ecdinc (vs-here it passes off in a white 
liquid state, like chyle), and vcrnihwse, produced by worms. 

The symptoms are frequent and copious discharges of 
feculent matter, accompinied usually with griping and flatu- 
lency ; there is weight and uneasiness in the lower belly which 
is relieved for a time on the discharge taking place ; there is

nausea, often vomiting ; a pale counttnance, somctime3 sallow ; 
a bitter taste in the mouth, with thirst and dryness of the 
throat ; the tongue is furred and yellow, indicating bile in the 
alimentary canal ; the skin is dry and harsh, and if the disease 
is not checked great eniacialion ensues. 

Tl'.e treat imnt must depend iti some degree on the cause ; 
the removal of the exciting matter, by means of an emetic, or 
aperient medicines, will, however, be a safe proceeding at first ; 
if the diarrh(Tea be caused by obstructed perspiration or expos- 
ure to cold, nauseating dose* of Antimonial, or Ipecacuanha 
Wine may be given every three or four hours, the feet put into 
a warm bath, and the patient be well covered up in bed. When 
the case is obstinate, -.esort maybe had to the vapour bath, 
making a free use of diluents and demulcents. Where there 
is acidity of the stomach, denoted by grijjing pains and 
flatulency, take Chalk Mixture, Aromatic Confection, and 
other anti-acid absorbents, or alkalies, such as Carbonate of 
Potash, with Spirits of Ammonia and Tincture of Opium, or 
some other anodyne ; if from putrid or otherwise unwholesome 
food, the proper course, after the removal of the offending 
matter, is to give absorbents, in combination with Opium, or 
if these fail, acid and an anodyne ; the following is an 
efficacious formula: Diluted Sulp^M-ic Acid, two drachms; 
Tincture of Opium, half a drachiTij Water, six ounces ; take a 
tablespoonful every two hours. When the looseness proceeds 
from acrid or poisonous substances, warm diluent drinks should 
be freely administered, to keep up vomiting previously excited 
by an emetic; for tnis purpose thin fat broth answers well; a 
purge of Castor Oil should also be given. The diarrhcea 
which often occurs in childhood during the teething, should 
not be suddenly checked, nor at all, unless it prevails to a hurt- 
ful extent ; if necessary to stop it, give first a dose of Mercury 
and Chalk, from two to four or six grains, according to age, and 
then powder of prepared Chalk, Cinnamon and Rhubarb, about 
two grains of each every four hours. Diarrhoea sometimes 
attacks pregnant women, and, in this case, its progress ought 
to be arrested as quickly as possible. In all cases of looseness 
of the bowels it is best to avoid hot thin drinks, unless given 
for a specihc purpose ; the food, too, should be simple and easy 
of digestion ; Milk with Cinnamon boiled in it, thickened with 
Rice or Arrowroot, is good ; vegetables, salt meat, suet puddings

and pics arc noi ; if there is nvich exhaustion, a little cool 
Brandy-and-Water ir ay be now ar.d then taken. When diarrhoea 
is stopped, nstriiigcnt t^ji'wcs, with aromatics, should be given 
to restore the tone of tlie ^toniach. 

This disease may hi distinguished from Dysentery, by being 
unattended by either inflammation, fever, c jntagion, or that con- 
stant inclination to go to stool \,itl',out a discharge, which is 
common in tl;e l.i'ler disease, in which the matter voided is 
sanguineous r.nd putrid, while that \\\ diarrhcea ir. simply fecu- 
lent and alimentary. — The Family Doctor. 

996. DIph'iticrla. 

In diphtlirr^a the false membrane accompanying inflamma- 
tion appears almost invariably in the frauccs or throat, and in 
many cases it is limited to this situation. It may extend more 
or less over the mucus surface within the mouth and nostrils. 
It is not infrequently produced within the windpipe, giving 
ris-e to all the symptoms of true croup, a id generally proving 
fatal. The disease rarely occurs except as an epidemic. Per- 
sons between three and twelve years of age are most apt to 
be affected with it, l)ut no period of life is exempc from a lia- 
bility to it. Frequent vomiting, diarrhcea, hemorrhage from 
the nostrils or elsewhere, convulsions, d'.lirium and coma are 
symptoms which denote great danger. The chief object? in the 
treatment are to palliate the symptoms and support the powers 
of life by the judicious employment of tonic remedies conjoined 
with alimentation and alcoholic stimulants. Tiie latter in 
some cases are given in large quantity without inducing their 
excitant effects, and there is reason to believe that they are 
sometimes the means of saving life. The following treatment 
has been tried in our own family, sind has been most success- 
ful : 

997. The Sulphur treatment of diphther{:i. — .^n eminent 
physician is said to have worked greMt v/onde:o in treating 
diphtheria with sulphur during the recent prevalence of an 
epidemic. A person who accompanied him says : " He put a 
teaspoonful of flour of brimstone into a wine glass of water, 
and stirred it with his finger instead of a spoon, as sulphur 
does not readily amalgamate with water. 'Vhen the sulphur 
was well mixed he gave it as a gargle, and in ten minutes the 
patient was out of danger. Instead of spitting out the gargle, 



Thk Dociot?. 



«83 



ho recommended the s\vall<-\ving of it. In extreme cases in 
M hich he had been called just in the nick of time, when the 
fun['us was too nearly closing to allow the gargle, he blew the 
sulphur through a quill into the throat, and, if the fungus had 
shrunk to alUnv of it, then the gargling. He never lost a pa- 
tient from diphtheria. If a patient cannot gargle, take a live 
coal, put it on a shovel, and sprinkle a spoonful or two of flour 
of brimstone at a time upon it: let the sufferer inhale it, hold- 
ing the head over it, and the. fungus will die. If plentifully 
used, the whole room may he filled almost to suffocation, and 
the patient can walk about in it, inhaling the fumes, with doors 
and windows closed." 

998. Typhoid Fevei*. 
This fever is called by Germans abdominal typhus, and by 
English and American writers, for the same reason, enteric 
fever. This characteristic, intestinal affection, is one of the 
essential points of distinction between typhoid and typhus 
fever Typhoid fever is undoul>ledly comm.unicable, yet it is 
rarely communicated to those who are brought into contact 
with cases of it, namely, physicians, nurses, and fellow patients 
in hospital wards ; and it occurs when it is quite impossible to 
attribute it to a contagion. It is more apt to prevail m 
the autumnal months than at oth.er seasons. The early 
symptoms are chilly sensations, pain in the head, loins and 
limbs, lassitude and looseness of the bowels. During the 
course of the fever stupor, as in cases of typhus, is more or 
less marked. In the majority of cases there is a characteristic 
eruption, usually confined to the trunk, but sometimes extend- 
ing to the limbs. The duration of the fever is longer than that 
of typhub. Che average, dating from the time of taking to the 
bed, being about sixteen days in the cases which end m 
recovery ; it is somewhat less in the fatal cases. Milk is pre- 
eminently the appropriate article of diet, and alcoholic stimu- 
lants are sometimes tolerated in very large quantities without 
any of the excitant or intoxicating effects which they would 
produce in health. Favourable liygicnic conditions arc impor- 
tant, such as free ventilation, a proper temperature and cleanli 

ness. 

999. Fits. 

Fainting fits are sometimes dangerous, at other times harm- 
less • should heart disease be the cause, the danger is great.

If from some slight cause, s-ucli as sight of \)\o )d, fright, ex- 
cessive heat, etc., there is no cause for alarm. It would be 
superfluous to enumerate the sjniptoms. The treatment : First, 
lay the patient upon his back with his head level with the feet, 
loosen all garments, da^-h cold water over the face ; sprinkle 
vinegar and water over the handr, and about the mouth, apply 
smelling salts to the nose, and when the patient has recovered 
a little, give twenty drops of sal volatile in water. 

1000. Apoplexy. 

These fits generally occur in stout, short-necked people- 
Symptoms : sparks before the eyes, giddiness, confusion of ideas; 
when the patient falls down insensible, the body is paralyzed, 
the face and head is flushed and hot, the eyes fixed, the breath- 
ing loud. Put the patient to bed, immediately raise the head, 
remove everything from the neck, bleed freely from the arm, 
if there is no lancet at hand use a penknife, put warm mustard 
poultices to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs, 
the bowels should be freely opened, take two drops of castor 
oil and mix with eight grains of calomel, put this as far back 
on the tongue as possible, the warmth of the throat will cause 
the oil to melt quickly, and so be absorbed inio the stomach. 
If the blood vessels about the head are much swollen put eight 
leeches on the temple opposite the paralyzed side. Send for 
surgeon at once. 

looi. Epilepsy. 

These fits generally attack young persons. Symptoms : 
Palpitations, pain in the head, but, Po a rule, the patient falls 
down suddenly without warning. The eyes are distorted, foam- 
ing at the mouth, the fingers tightly clenched and the body 
much agitated ; wlien the fit is over the patient feels drowsy 
and faint. Keep the patient flat on his back, slightly raise the 
head, loosen all garments round the neck, dash cold water 
upon the face, place a piece of wood between the teeth to 
prevent the patient hurting his tongue. Give bromide of 
sodium in twenty-grain doses, in v/ater, twice or three times a 
day. 

1002. Hysteria. 

A nervous affection chiefly seen in females, and generally 
connected with uterine irregularities ; it is sometimes called 
Clavus or Globus Hisiericus, and is commonly known as

Hysterics. As this is a very ( (.mmon nffcction, within the pro- 
vince of domestic treatment, it is desinil)le that we should devote 
some Httle space to a consideration of it. It is a curious circum- 
stance connected vv,th this affeciion that it stimulates almost 
every disease to which humanity is liable. A patient suffering 
under Hysteria may have a rniigh, hoarse, croupy cough loss 
of voice, hiccup, pain in the left side, fluttering of the heart, 
running at the eyes and nose, spasmodic contractions and con- 
vulsive movements of various kinds, vomiting, copious evacua- 
tions, delirium, and all kinds of violent and unmanageable 
symptoms, which subside as soon as the hysterical paroxysm 
does All this shows that the whole nervous system is pecu- 
liarly influenced by the affection. An attack generally comes 
on with a sensation of choking ; it seems as if a ball were rising 
in the throat and threatening to stop the passage of the air; 
then the trunk and limbs become strongly convulsed, so much 
so that an apparently feeble woman will require three or four 
strong persons to restrain her from injuring her.elf; then 
follows the hysterical sobbing and crying, with alternate hts of 
laughter; generally the head is thrown back, the face flushed, 
the eyeUds closed and tremulous ; the nostrils distended, and 
the mouth firmly shut; there is a strong movement m the 
throat, which is projected forward, and a wild throwing about 
of the arms and hands, with sometimes a tearing of the hair, 
rending of the clothes, catching at the throat, and attempts to 
bite those who impose the necessary restraint. After awhile 
the deep and irregular breathing, the obvious palpitation of the 
heart with the symptoms above enumerated will cease; there 
will be an expulsion of wind upwards, and the patient will sink 
down, sobbing and sighing, to remain tranquil for a sliorter or 
longer period, at the end of which she may again start up and 
be as violent as ever ; or she may go off into a calm s.eep, from 
which she will probably awake quite recovered, \ fit ot 
Hysteria may last for a few minutes only, or for sevend hours, 
or even days. Persons have died under such an mfliction. It 
may generally be distinguished from epilepsy by the absence 
of foaming at the mouth, which is nearly always present m that 
disease, and also by the peculiar twinkling of the eyehd^; wj^jch 
is a distinguishing symptom oi great value, u:id u

starin;,' and projcckd cycbars, and a frightful cxjircssion of 
count(MiaiK-c. Not r. > in Hysteria ; tlie cheeks are usually red, 
and the eyes, if n' t liiddcn by the closed eyelids, are bright and 
at rest ; the sobbing, sighing, short cnc:, and Ir.ughter, too, are 
characteristic of the lottcr affe<'iii)n. We point out tiicse 
distinctions so that ro unnecessary alarm may be felt during a fit 
of Hysteria, wliicii is seldom attcr^led with ultimitc danger either 
to mini or body, although the symptoms are j^ufliciently dis- 
tressing to cause anxiety. 

Treatment, — The first efforts must be directed to prevent 
the patient, if violent, from injuring herself; l)ut this should 
not be done in a rude, rough mnnner. It is, p vhaps, best to 
confine her hands by v/rapping tightly romid her a sheet or 
blanket. The dress should be loosened, especially round the 
throat, and the face freely exposed to fiesh air, and both that 
and the head well washed wi'h cold water ; if siie can and will 
swallow, an ounce of camphor mixture, with a tcaspoonful of 
Ether, Sal-volatile, tincture of Assafoeiida, or Valerian, may ])e 
administered ; strong Liquid Ammonia may be afiplied to tl; j 
nostrils ; and if the fit is of long duration, an enema injected, 
consisting of Spirits of Turpentine, Castor Oil, and Tincture of 
Assafoetida, of each half an ounce, in h:ilf a pint of gruol. 
What is required is a strong stimulus to tlie nervous system ; 
therefore, dashing cc^ld water on the face, and hot applicatious 
to the spine, are likely to be of service. Sir A. Carlisle recom- 
mends that a polished piece of steel, held in boiling water for a 
minute or two, be passed down the back over a silk handker- 
chief. This has been found to prevent the recurrence of the 
paroxysm, which has before been periodic ; by which it would 
seem that the patient has some power of controlling the symp- 
toms when a sufificiently strong stimulus is applied to enable or 
induce her to exercise it. 

During the intermission or attacks of Hysteria, attention 
should be devoted to any constitutional or organic defects, from 
which they are likely to arise ; the patient's mind should be 
kept as tranquil as possible, and a tendency to all irregular 
habits or excesses held in check ; if plethoric, there should be 
spare diet, and perhaps leeching ; if scrofulous and weakly, 
good nourishing food and tonic medicines, particularly some 
form of iron, the shower bath, regular exercise, cheerful com- 
pany ; antispamodics, and remedies which have a gently stim-

u! ;Liiig effect, will frequently relieve the sleeplessness complained 
(,r by hysterical patients better than opiates and other naicoties. 
In such cases Dr. Graves recommends pills ccniposed of a 
l^uin of musk and two or three grains of As-afu^tida, to be 
taken two or three times a day. A cliange in the mode of life, 
involving entering upon new cares and dulico, will frequently 
tffcLt a complete cure oi Hysteria, which, it has been observed, 
seldom attacks women of a vigorous mind. It is extremely de- 
sirable that, in the education of young females, the bodily 
powers should be well exercised and developed. Too little 
attention is paid to this generally, and the consequence is that 
a groat many of our young women are weak and nervous, and 
frequently subject to hysterical affections. 

1003. Quinsy. 

Though called tonsillites, the inflammation is rarely confined 
to the tonsils, but involves the pharynx, the soft palate and the 
uvula and sometimes extends to the root of the tongue. It 
commences with a feeling of dryness and discomfort about the 
throat and wiih pain in swallowing. The mucous membrane 
lining the throat is reddened, and the tonsils are more or less 
swollen. As the disease advances, the inllamed parts, at first 
dry, because covered with vicid mucous, and the distress of 
the' patient is greatly enhanced by the effort which lie is 
tempted to make to remove thi; secretion. In many cases 
suppuration occurs in one or both tonsils; when this takes 
place those organs are often enormously swollen, and, together 
with the obstruction of the inflamed pab.te, may render breath- 
ing difficult and painful. In such cases the febrile reaction is 
siu)ngly marked, the skin being hot and the pulse full and 
frequent, the patient is unable to take nourishment, and the 
voice becomes thick and characteristic of the disease. The 
disease, though painful, is attended with li'tle danger, but the 
inflammation may by extension involve the larynx and thus 
prove fatal. The diser , --equires but little treatment. Where 
the mucous membrane aione is involved, a stringent gargle, re- 
peated five or six times a day, usually gives relief. The food 
should be liquid— soups, beef tea, milk, etc.— and should be

^vhich acts as a poultice to the innamcd parts. As soon as tbc 
location of the abscess can Ijc dulcrnuned, it should be opened, 
tiftcT which there is usually no further trouble. 

1004. An Excellent Remedy for a Cold. 

Take a iarj^e tcacupful of linseed, two pennyworth of stick- 
liquorice, and 0. fjuarter of a pound of suti raisins. Put those 
into two quarts of soft water, and let it simmer over a slow fire 
till it is reduced to one ; then add to it a ([uarterof a pound of 
brown sugar-candy (pounded), a tablespoonful of old rum, and 
a tablespoonful of the best white-wine vinegar, or lemon-juice. 
Drink half a pint at going to bed, and take a little when the 
cough is troublesome. This receipt generally cures the worst 
of colds in two or three days, and if taken in time, may be said 
to be almost an infallible remedy. It is a most balsamic cor- 
dial for the lungs, without the opening qualities which en- 
danger fresh colds on going out. It has been known to cure 
colds that have been almost settled into consumption, in less 
than three weeks. The rum and vinegar are best to be added 
only to the quantity you are going immediately to take ; for if 
it is put into the whole it is apt to grow flat. 

1005. Colds (How to prevent). "^ 

The Popuhir Science Monthly gives good advice in regard to 
the prevention of colds. The mistake is often made of not 
taking great care to put on extra wraps and coats when pre- 
paring for outdoor exercise. This is not at all necessary in 
robust persons. Sufficient heat to prevent all risk of chill is 
generated in the body by exercise. The care should be taken 
to retain sufficient clothing after exercise, and when at rest to 
prevent the heat passing out of the body. Indeed, persons 
very often catch chills from throwing off extra clothing after 
exercise, or from sitting about in garments the material of 
which is not adapted to prevent the radiation of heat from the 
body. 

1006. Cou£h. 

A convulsive effort of the lungs to get relief of phlegm or 
other matter ; it may be a symptom of Bronchitis, or Catarrh^ 
or Crm-p. or hifliienza. or Larynntis. or Phthisis, or Pleurisy ^ 
or Pneutnonia, or Relaxed Uvula, also Hooping Ough.

gard to the treatment of simple cough without reference to the 
•pecuhar disease of which it may ho sym[)tomatic ; and first let 
us observe, that it may he cither what is j)ro[)crly, as well 0= 
medically, termed az-y or //toiif. In the farmer case, Opium 
and its preparation.-? are advisable, iti the litter tiuy should not 
be used; the ir.itation will be best alia) ed by ilei.bane or 
Hemlock, tidier the Tincture or Extract, with demuU;euts, as 
Harley Water, Linseed-Tea, etc., and Li(iuori(:e, eii.;er the Root 
boiled, or Extract ; it is well also to add from five to Ici drops 
of Ipecacuanha Wine to each dose; inhalation also of the 
steam from boiling water will generally be found beneucia! — 
and especially if some medicinal herb, such as Horehounu or 
Coltsfoot, be infused in it. In moist coughs t) ere should not 
be so much fluid taken, and the use of demulcents must be 
somewhat restricted. Opiates may be administered, but not 
too freely, either separately or in cough mixtures ; I'aregoric 
Elixir, in which the Oi)ium is combined with Benzoic Acid and 
Oil of Aniseed (expectorants^, and Cami)hor (antispamodic), is 
perhaps the best form of administration ; a teaspoonful in a 
glass of water generally allays the irritation and frequent desire 
to cough which arises from it. In cases where there is diffi- 
culty of expectoration, some such mixture as this should be 
taken : compound Tincture of Camphor, four drachms ; Ipeca- 
cuanha Wine and Oxymel of Squills, of each two drachms; Mu- 
cilage of Acacia, one ounce; water, four ounces, mix and take 
a tablespoonful when the cou-h is troublesome ; for old people, 
two drachms of Tincture of IJerzoin, c>)mmonly called Friar's 
Balsam, may be added to the above ; and if there should be 
much fever, two drachms of Sweet Spirits of Nitre. For all 
kinds of cough counter irritants should 'e applied, such as 
blisters and warm plasters, rubbing in of stuuuLiting ointments 
on the chest and between the shoulders; those parts also 
should be well protected by flannels next the skin, dressed 
hare skin and other contrivances of the kind. For coughs 
which are more particularly troul)lesome by n;gh% it is best to 
give the Opium, Henbane, or HemloLR, as the case may l.'C, ^t 
bedtime, in the shape of a [ill ; of the extracts of either of 
the latter, five grains may be given ; of the first, one or two 
5 — Jnc ,x (U^ r.nm or n niinrt^er of H trrain of Ivloruhine. A lonsi 
experience of their efficacy among a large number of dispensary 
', ttienis enables the author to recommend with confidence the

following pills : take of Compound Squill Pill, one drachm ; 
Ipecacuanha Powder and Extract o." Hyoscyamus, of each, half 
a drachm ; mix and make into twenty-four pills, take one or 
two on going to rest. 

1007. HeatCache. 

Headache may arise from a variety of causes; consequently 
the preventive measures vary according to the nature of the 
attack. When it is of that kind which is dependent on rheu- 
matism, and which affects the muscles, extending often from the 
forehead to the back, and sometimes involving the temples, 
the patient should l)e as much as possible in the open air, and 
should use the shower bath every morning. When the form 
of headache is accompanied with tenderness of the scalp, and 
acute pain on pressure, indicating an affection of the immediate 
covering of the bones — besides exercise in the open air, the 
head should be shaved and washed twice a day, namely, morn- 
ing and evening, w'th cold water, and afterwards gently rubbed 
with a towel for ten or fifteen minutes. The residence should 
be in a dry, somewhat elevated situation ; and quietude of 
mind should be maintained. When the pain in the forehead 
and th; back of the hi:ad is obtuse, and accompanied with a 
sensation of torpor and oppression ; and when this occurs in 
weak and irritable persons, besides the necessary medical 
treatment, which ought not to be neglected, all mental appli- 
cations should be suspended and chejrful society cultivated ; 
tht diet should be moderate, and the utmost attention paid to 
the state of the bowels. Exercise and shower baths are as 
essential in this us in the other varieties of the headache. 
Lastly, in what is usually termed sick headache, denoted by 
either acute or dull pain over the left temple, with some tender- 
ness of the part, throbbing, and r.n incapacity at the time 
for any mental exertion, the whole arising generally from 
indigestion, or some error in diet pr vious to the occurrence 
of the headache, it is scarcely necessary to say that prudence 
in diec, both v.'ith respect to quantity and quality, should b: 
observed. Eong fasting, excess of wine or any stimulant, pro- 
tracted sedentary occupations, hurry of business and anxiety,

mind, and agreeable social intercourse, will do more to regulate 
the stomach and bowels, in those predisposed to this form 
of headache, than any plan of medical treatment which can be 
suggested. 

looS. Hoadache Sponged Away. 

Nervous headache has often been called woman's curse. 
The hard day's shopping, the day when everything in the house- 
hold " went wrong," the afternoon spent in paying calls, or a 
day of ceaseless toil with the needle,— all these are apt to end in 
the state mentioned, to the great discomfort of husband and 
family, and still greater of the sufferer herself. 

Bromides are the most common resort in such a case, but 
they soon lose their effect. A sponge and hot water will effect 
the best cure of all, if properly used. 

First, fasten the hair high on the head, to keep it as dry as 
possible, have the water just as //«?/ as you can stand it, soak 
the sponge and place it at the back of the neck. Apply it also 
behind the ears, where centre --ost of the nerves and muscles 
of the head ; and these will b jund to soften and relax most 
deliciously. Often the pain will be relieved in a few minutes. 
Then, in the same manner, bathe face and temples, and 
when through give the face a dash of cold water. If you have 
an hour to spare afterward darken your room and he down. 
You will be more than apt to fall into a gentle slumber, from 
which to arise refreshed and strengthened, with all trace of 
nervousness gone. 

The face bath with hot water is far better than any cosmetic; 
it restores to the face color and smoothness of outline, and 
helps to keep away wrinkles. It quickens the circulation and 
keeps the pores open and the skin perfectly clean ; and iPyou are 
expecting to attend an evening party, after such a day of wear, 
and view with dismay the drawn lines of the face and eyes and 
the hollow looks of the latter, let me urge you to try my remedy 
—not neglecting the nap, if possible— and great will be the 
change thereafter in your appearance. Tiie lines will be gone, 
and the look of distress ; the soft, healthful color will come 
pcrain to the cheek and lip, and a restful and rested look return 
io the eyes, and you willbe once more in condition to enjoy— 
and, better yet, to be enjoyed.

1009. Cephalic SnufF. 

Lundyfoot snuff and as abaracca leaves, of each two ounces ; 
lavender flowers, two drachms ; essence of bergamot and oil of 
cloves, of each four drops. Gruid the lavender with the snuff 
and leaves to a fine powder ; then add the perfume. Much 
recommended in headaches, dimness of sight, etc. 

loio. Bilious or Sick Headache. 

Headache is, in general, a symptom of indigestion, or de- 
ranged general health, or the consequence of a confined state of 
the bowels. The following alterative pill will be found a valu- 
able medicine : Take of calomel, ten grains ; emetic tartar, 
two, thr. e, or four grains ; precipitated sulphurtt of antimony, 
one scruple ; guaiacum in powder, one drachm. Rub them 
well together in a mortar for ten minutes, then, with a little 
conserve of hips, make them into a mass, and divide it into 
twenty pills. I)ose. — One pill is given every night, 01 every 
other night, for several weeks in succession. 

ion. Hiccough. 

This may usually be removed by the exhibition of warm 
carminatives, cordials, cold water, weak spirits, camphor julep, 
or spirits of sal-volatile. A sudden fright or surprise will often 
produce the like effect. An instance is recorded of a delicate 
young lady that was troubled with hiccough for some month?, 
and who was reduced to a state of extreme debility from the 
loss of sleep occasioned thereby, who was cured by a fright, 
after medicines and topical applications had failed. A pmch 
of snuff, a glass of co/d soda-water, or an ice cream will also 
frequently remove this complaint. 

1012. Cramp. 

When cramp occurs in the limbs, warm friction with the 
naked hand, or with the following stimulating liniment, will 
generally be found to succeed in removing it : 

T/ie Liniment. — Take of water of ammonia, or of spirit of 
hartshorn, one ounce; olive oil, two ounces. Shake them 
together till they unite. 

When the stomach is affected, brandy, ether, laudanum, or 
tinctf -e of gmger aftbrds the speediest means of cure. The 
following draught may be taken with great advantape : Laud- 
amim, forty or fifty drops ; tincture of ginger, t;j<i^drachms j

syrup ol poppirs one drachm ; cinnamon or mint water, one 
ounce. Mr: a draught. To be rci^eated in an hour, if 

necessary. . , • , j 

In severe cases, hot flannels, moistened with compound 
camphor liniment and turpentine, or a bladder nearly filled 
with hot water, at 100 dsg. or 120 deg. Fahr., should be applied 
to the pit of the stomach ; bathing the feet in warm walen cr 
applying a mustard poultice to them is frequently of great 

advantr.ge. 

* * The best preventatives, when the cause of cramp is con- 
stitutional, are warm tonics, such as the essence of ginger and 
camomile, Jamaica ginger in powder, etc., avoiding fermented 
•iquors and green vegetables, especially for supper, and wearing 
flannel next to the skin. 
1013. Neuralgia (Greek neuroK, a Ner-ve.and algos, Pain)^ 

A painful afi"ection of the neiN es : when it occurs in those 
of the face, it is termed fa.ccgiie, or tic doloreux ; v^'^tn it 
affects the great nerve of the leg, it is called sciatica ; other parts, 
such as the fingers, tlie chest, the abdomen, etc., are also liable 
to this agonizing pain, one of the most severe and wearing to 
which the human frame is liable; the exact nature of it is not 
very clear, that is to say, the origin of the disease, for although 
its immediate seat is a nerve, or set of nerves yet the«^i^^ 
be some originating cause. It can frequently be trae<*» t© 
some decay, or diseased growth of the bone about those parts 
through which the nerves pass ; and in some severe cases it 
has been found to depend upon the irritation caused by foreign 
bodies acting upon those highly sensitive organs. 1 he only 
symptom of neuralgia generally, is a violent plunging and 
darting pain, which comes on in paroxysms ; except in very 
severe and protracted cases, there is no outward redness nor 
swelling to mark the seat of the pain, neither is there usua ly 
constitutional derangement, other than that w'hich may be 
caused by want of rest, and the extreme agony of the sut^fng 
while it lasts, which may be from one to two or three hours, or 
even more, but it is not commonly so long. Tenderness and 
swelling of the part sometimes occurs, where there has been a

tory symptoms, are distinctive marks of the disease Among 
ts exciting causes, we may mention exposure to damp and 
cold espTdally if combined with malaria; and to these influ- 
ences a person with a debilitated constitution will be more sub- 
let than another. Anxiety of mind will sometimes bring 1 on. 
ind so will a disordered state of the stomach, more particularly 
a state in which there is too much acid. 

As for ^rea/meni, that, of course, musi depend upon the cause ; 
if it is a decayed tooth, which, by its exposure of the nerve to 
he action of the atmosphere, set. up this pam. it should be a 
once removed, as there will be l^tle Peace ^or the patien^^un U 
there is : if co-existent with neuralgia there is a disordered 
stomach suspicion should at once point tl-reto and effor 
should be made to correct the disorder there. If the patient is 
ivL. ina moist, low situation, he should at once be removed 
to a^igher levd, and a dry, gravelly soil. Ionics, such as 
Qufnine and Iron, should be given, and a tolerably gene ous 
diet but without excess of any kind. In facial Neuralgia, 
blsJers behind the ears, or at the back of the neck have been 
found serviceable, and/if the course of the "^rve which appears 
to be the seat of mischief can be traced, a belladonna pla.te 
or a piece of rag soaked in Laudanum and laid along it, will 
sometimes give relief; so will hot fomentations of poppies and 
camomUes or bran poultices sprinkled with turpentine. In 
vry sever; cases ^ of a grain of Morphine may be given to 
deaden the nervous sensibility, and induce sleep, which the 
patient is often deprived of at night, the pain coming on as 
soon as he gets warm in bed. . , 

An application of Chloroform on hnt has sometimes proved 
very effectual in relieving severe Neuralgic pains, and so has 
an ointment composed of Lard and Veratrine. in the propor- 
tion ot six prains to the ounce. , 
A mixture of Chloroform and Aconite has been recommended 
for facial Neuralgia, the form of preparation being two parts of 
Spirits of Wine, or Eau de Cologne, one of Chlorc.orm and 
one of Tincture of Aconite, to be applied to the gums of the 
side affected by means of a finger covered with a piece of 
lint, or soft linen, and rubbed along tt^^«\5jhe danger of dr^^^^ 
ping any into the mouth being thus avoided. When the pam 
is connected with some organic disease as a decayed ^oth' 
or chronic inflammation of the gums, or of the sockets or super-

ficial necrosis of the bone, substitute Tincture of Iodine for 
fhTsSTn the above formula. We would caution our readers 
suong^y against the careless inhalation of Chloroform as a 
remedy for Neuralgia, which appears to be growmg into a 
eeneral practice ; several deaths have resulted from it, the 
nracTce being to pour a little on a pocket handkerchief, with- 
out much regird to quantity, and hold it to the mouth until the 
requTred insensibility is produced. This remedy should neve 
be adrninistered, except under the supervision of a medical

Pxtremelv careful not to expose themselves to wet o co d :

brbg it on where there is the slightest tendency to it. 

1014. Croup.

the following mixture :-Ipecacuanha Wine, half an ounce ,

1015. Treatment of Bunions. 

This consists in removing all pressure from the part. The 
formation of a hunion may in the beginning be prevented, but 
only in the be^innin^ ; for when actually formed, it is scarcely 
possible ever to get rid of it, and it remains an everlasting 
plague. To prevent the formation of a bunion, it is necessary 
whenever or wherever a boot or shoe pinches, to have it eased 
at once, and so long as that part of the foot pinched remains 
tender, not to put on the offending shoe again. When a bun- 
ion has once completely formed, if the person wish to have 
any peace, and not to have it increase, he must have a last 
made to fit his foot, and have his shoe made upon it. And 
whenever the bunion inflames, and is painful, it must be bathed 
with warm water and poulticed at night. 

1016. Stye. 

The stye is strictly only a little boil which projects from the 
edge of the eyelid. It is of a dark red color, much inflamed, 
and occasionally a great deal more painful than might be 
expected, considering its small size. It usually disappears of 
itself, after a little time, especially if some purgative medicine 
be taken. 

If the stye be very painful and inflamed, a small warm poul- 
tice of linseed meal, or bread and milk, must be laid over it, 
and renewed every five or six hours, and the bowels freely 
acted upon by a purgative draught, such as the following : — 
Take of Epsom salts, half an ounce ; best manna, two 
drachms ; infusion of senna, six drachms ; tincture of senna, two 
drachms ; spearmint water, one ounce ; distilled water, two 
ounces. Mix ; and take three, four, or five tablespoonfuls. 

When the stye appears ripe, an opening should be made into 
it with the point of a large needle, and afterwards a little of the 
following ointment may be smeared over it once or twice a day. 
Ointment. — Take of spermaceti, six drachms ; white wax, two 
drachms ; olive oil, three ounces. Melt them together over a 
slow fire, and stir them constantly until they are cold 

1017. Simple Remedies. 

A teaspoonful of lime-water will cure the worst case of 
colic. This is something every mother should know. 

A couple of fig,s eaten before breakfast are an excellent laxa- 
tive, especially for children.

When suffering from overstrained and tired eyes, bathe 
them in hot water several times a day. 

For cankered throats, mix equal parts of powdered borax 
and sulphur, and blow a little into the throat thorough a quill. 

For a cough, boil one ounce of flaxseed in a pint of water, 
strain and add a little honey, one ounce of rock candy, and the 
juice of three lemons. Mix and boil well. Drink as hot as 

possible. 

For ivy poisoning, boil wood ashes enough to make a strong 
lye ; wash the poisoned parts in this, let it remain on a few 
minutes, and wash off in soft lukewr.rm water ; when dry anomt 
with vaseline. Repeat this process as the poison develops 
itself. One or two applications will effect a cure. 

Only a scratch ! and yet a scratch has often cost a life. 
A scratch should be carefully washed with a little Castile soap 
and warm water. It should never be touched by the finger 
nails. If there is any appearance of inflammation, a small 
bread-and milk poultice, or the application of some medicated 
clay, will be the safest and best treatment. A sudden and 
decided change in the weather, or a poor condition of the 
blood, will often favor the scratch, and develop it as an agent 
for serious evil. 

1018. Oatmeal Drink (Recipe by the late Or Parkes). 
" The proportions are a quarter pound of oatmeal to two 
or three quarts of water, according to the heat of the day and 
the work and thirst ; it should be well boiled, and then an ounce 
or one and a half ounces of brown sugar added. If you find it 
thicker than you like, add three quarts of water. Before drink- 
ing it shake up the oatmeal well through the liquid. In sum- 
mer drink the cold ; in winter hot. You will find it not only 
quenches thirst, but will give you more strength and endurance 
than any other dtink. If you cannot boil it you can take a 
little oatmeal mixed with cold water and sugar, but this is not 
so good ; always boil it if you can. If at any time you have to 
work a very long day, as in harvest, and cannot stop for meals, 
increase the oatmeal to half pound or even three quarters 
pound, and the water to three quarts if you are likely to be very 
thirsty. If you cannot get oatmeal, wheat-flour will do, but not 
quite so well." Those who tried this recipe last year found 
that they could get through more work than when using beer, 
and were stronger and healthier at the end of the harvest.

1019 Chilblains. 

Paint them with iodine, or apply camphor ointment. 
1020. For Inflamed or Weak Eyes. 

Half fill a bottle with common rock salt; add the best of 
French brandy till all but full. Shake it, let it settle, and bathe 
the outside of the eye with a soft linen cloth on going to bed 
and occasionally through the day. This will be fo'jnd a good 
application for pains and bruises generally. 

1021. Earache. 

That bugbear of the nursery, earache, will soon yield to 
proper treatment. Make a poultice of hops and vinegar and 
bind it upon the aching member ; almost instant relief will 
follow. One drop of onion juice and two drops of sweet oil 
should be put into the ear immediately after the poultice is 
taken off, to prevent a recurrence of the pain. 

1022. Dcficienoy of Wax in the Ear. 

Deafness is sometimes the consequence of a morbidly dry 
state of the inner passages of the ear. In such cases, intro- 
duce a piece of cotton wool, dipped in an equal mixture of oil 
of turpentine and oil of sweet almonds, or in the liniment of 
carbonate of ammonia. 

1023. Accumulation of Wax in the Ear. 

To remedy this, which is a very frequent cause of deafness, 
introduce a small piece of cotton wool, upon which a little oil 
of sweet almonds has been dropped, into the ear, and kt it 
remain there for a day or two. Then syringe the ear with a litt'e 
warm milk and water, or a solution of soap or with a solution 
of common salt and water, in the proportion of two drachms of 
the former to half an ounce of the latter. The solution of salt 
is the best solvent of accumulated wax in the ear. 

1024. To Remove Nervous Anxiety. 

Keep the bowels regular with mild purgatives, take plenty of 
exercise in the open air, adopt a light nutritious diet, and seek 
pleasant society. A teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, or of 
magnesia, or a few drops of laudanum taken the last thing at 
night, will generally have the effect of preventing watchfulness. 



The Doctor.

1025. Hives. 
The irritation caused by hives can be allayed by dipping the 
bare finger in sweet oil and gently rubbing the affected parts^ 
Under this treatment the intense itching ceases, and tne child 
soon falls into a peaceful sleep. 

1026. Poultices and Plasters. 

The convenient mustard leaves should be kept in every 
house But in the case of children, a milder plaster than one 
of puie mustard may be required. For an infant it is never 
safe to use more than one quarter mustard completing the 
plaster with three-quarters flour or linseed meal. For an older 
child one half mustard to one half flour may be used Should 
a strong plaster be needed use pure mustard. In each case mix 
with boiling water to the consistence of thick paste, spread the 
pkster on a thick cotton cloth, lay over the face of the plaster a 
piece of thin old linen to prevent it touchmg the skin. A roll 
o old linen handkerchiefs should always be kept on hand to be 
used for this purpose, and there should be a roll of cotton 
sheeting convenient to spread plasters and poultices on when 
needed A small can of mustard and a can of flour should be 
kept as well as a box of prepared mustard plasters for use at 
night and in emergencies when it is not always convcnien o 
depend upon kitchen supplies. When a prepared mu tard 
Piaster is used it should be dipped in bo.hng water, and alayer 
o thin men cambric should be laid over the face of >t when it 
fs pu ton. After applying, cover any plaster of this kind with 
hick flannel, laid over the back, to prevent the dampness from 
t penetrating the clothing. Where a mustard pilaster is 
em^oved phyficians usually order a layer of cotton wadding to 
reSace it,in order to prevent the patient taking cold, and 
co?ton wadding should always be kept at hand for this purpose, 
with the materials for making the paste. 

1027. To Produce Perspiration. 

Twelve drachms of anjtimonial wine and two drachms of 
laudanum. Of tliis mixture eighteen drops may be taken in 
water every five or six hours. 

1028. Lotion to Remove Freckles. 

Mix two ounces of rectified spirits of wine add two tea- 
spoonfuls of muriatic acid, with one pound and a half of dis- 
tilled water.

1029. Ointment for Chilblains 

Calomel and camphor, of each two drachms ; spermaceti 
ointment, eight drachms ; oil of turpentine, four drachms. Mix 
well together. Apply, by gentle friction, two or three times 

daily. 

1030. To Raise a Blister Speedily. 

A piece of lint dropped into v negar of cantharides, and 
immediately aft-r its application to the skin covered over with 
a piece of strapping to prevent evaporation. 

1031. Dyspepsia, Heartburn, and Acidity. 

Pure water, five ounces ; carbonate of ammonia, two 
drachms; syrup of orange peel, one ounce. Mix. For a six- 
ounce mixture. 

1032. Warming Plaster. 

Burgundy pitch, seven parts, melt and add plaster of can- 
tharides, one part. Some add a little camphor. Used in chest 
complaints, local pains, etc. 

1033. Rules for the Preservation of Health. 

Adopt the plan of rising early, and never sit up late at night. 

Wash the whole body every morning with cold water, by 
means of a large sponge, and rub it dry with a rough towel, or 
scrub the whole body for ten or fifteen minutes with flesh- 
brushes. 

Drink waters generally, and avoid excess of spirits, wine, 
and fermented liquors. 

Sleep in a room which has free access to the open air, and 
is well ventilated. 

Keep the head cool by washing it with cold water when 
necessary, and abate feverish and inflammatory symptoms 
when they arise by persevering stillness. 

Symptoms of plethora and indigestion may be corrected by 
eating and drinking less per diem for a short time. 

Never eat a hearty supper, especially of animal food. 

Exercise, regularly adopted, conduces to preserve the health, 
and should always be taken by those who value so inestimable 
a blessing.
