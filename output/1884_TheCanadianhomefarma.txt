PKEFACE. 




HE Editors' aims in the preparation of the CANADIAN HOME, 
FARM, AND BUSINESS CYLOPEDIA have been thoroughly 
practical. Their motive was to place within the reach of 
every householder a treasury of reference in all that 
concerns the Home and its affairs, Business Life and its 
duties, and such information as great practical experience 
could suggest in the cultivation and management of the 
Farm. 

Almost every one has felt the need of a work to which one 
could turn in any difficulty for just such facts as this Cyclopaedia will fur- 
nish facts relative to the concerns of every day life, its duties and its plea- 
sures, and the means by which the former is lightened and the latter en- 
hanced. To obtain this information has hitherto involved the search 
through many volumes, which could only be acquired at much expense. 
Here it will be found in a concise and well-arranged compendium, " to be 
read and understood of all men ; " and the assistance afforded will no 
doubt be appreciated. 

A reference to the contents will show what a field of inquiry the work 
covers. Rarely within the scope of a single volume have so many subjects 
been so usefully compressed : with such a wealth of material presented to 
the reader, no one can fail to find either what he is in search of, or some 
facts that may be useful to him through life. 

The CANADIAN HOME, FARM, AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA, besides 
its opening chapters on Home Amenities, will be found replete in all that 
contributes to home education, home arts, home pleasures, home comforts, 
and home amusements. 

Large space is taken up with social forms and the usages of polite 
society, for the benefit of those of both sexes, who seek to shine in it, and 
for the information of all who desire to appear in the world to the highest 
personal advantage. Even those who are well informed in respect to 
these matters are sometimes at a loss to know what to do under certain 
circumstances. To all such this department of the work must be welcome. 



PREFACE. 



The important matter of health, and how to preserve it ; what to do in 
the case of illness; with hints in regard to cooking, carving, and othe 
home accomplishme^s, will be found to have had attention. Driving 
riding, swimming, rowing, and other physical exercises, have also been 
treated of, as have dancing, and in-door and out-door amusements^ 

Much space has also been devoted to educational, commercial and legal 
affairs, which can hardly fail to be of the utmost value. Book-keeping, a 
it deserved has been given special prominence, while arithmeti 
ship, and the forms of business correspondence have been f , 
The digest of mercantile law, and the forms of legal documents mus 
acceptable additions to the book, as must also the complete letter-writ 
and the various forms of social invitation. 

The Farm Department has been specially edited by Prof W. Brown, 
Superintendent of the Experimental Farm, Guelph, than whom there^ 
no better authority on this special subject m the Dominion. 

refac' will be found in the book. The whole work, it is believed, 
Lets a general need, and it is offered to the Canadian public with every 
confidence in its success. THE EDITORS.

CYCLOPEDIA. 



vthc 0nimion of (Janaba. 




Dominion of Canada comprises the Provinces of Onta- 
rio, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward 
Island, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories. 
The central government is at Ottawa and the adminis- 
tration of Dominion affairs in the hands of the governor- 
general, and a privy council ; and the legislative machi- 
nery consists of the House of Commons and the Senate. 

OXTARIO, 

the most populous member of the confederation, is bounded on the N. E. 
and E. by the Province of Quebec ; on the S. E., S. S. W. and W. by the 
River St. Lawrence and the great lakes ; and on the N.W. and N. by Mani- 
toba. Its length from south-east to north-west is about 750 miles; and 
from south-west to north-east 500 miles. A large portion of territory is 
yet in dispute beetween the Ontario and Dominion governnments, the 
former claiming that it belongs to Ontario, the latter that it is really part 
of Manitoba. The total area of land and inland water of the province is 
about 107,780 square miles, or equal to 68,979,200 acres. The country's 
surface is undulating rather than mountainous, and is widely diversified 
with rivers and lakes. A main water-shed divides the waters of the St. 



18 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Lawrence from those of the Ottawa ; and the Laurentian Hills run west- 
ward from the Thousand Isles to Lake Simcoe, and thence form the coast 
of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron. The agricultural capabilities are very 
great. A fertile belt extends over three-fourths of the present inhabited 
parts, and a considerable portion of the territory in the hands of the 
government. Large crops of spring and fall wheat are raised; as also 
oats, barley, rye, Indian corn, potatoes, turnips, &c., &c. The apple- 
orchards of the south-western counties are exceedingly productive, and 
pears, plums, grapes and cherries thrive there luxuriantly. The climate 
is tempered by the near proximity of the lakes, and the winter is shorter 
and less severe than that of Quebec. The principal rivers of Ontario 
are the tributaries of the Ottawa; the French, the Maganetawan, the 
Severn and the Nottawasaga falling into the Georgian Bay ; the Sau- 
geen, the Maitland and the Aux Sables falling into Lake Huron ; the 
Thames running into Lake St. Clair ; the Grand into Lake Erie ; the 
Trent under different names into Bay Quinte", and the Niagara into Lake 
Ontario. The gorgeous St. Lawrence sweeps through the eastern part of 
the province from Kingston. The lakes are many and the largest on the 
globe. They are Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario. Among the lesser 
lakes are Nepigon, Simcoe and Nipissing. The province is rich in miner- 
als. Iron, copper, lead, plumbago, antimony, arsenic, manganese, gypsum ; 
marble of superior quality and building stone abound in the region be- 
tween Georgian Bay and the Ottawa. On the north shore of Lake On- 
tario there are extensive copper mines, and on the shore of Lake Superi- 
or, especially at Thunder Bay, there are valuable silver deposits. There 
are also found there amethysts, agates, mica, iron, gold, cobalt and bis- 
muth. In the south-westerly part of the province are inexhaustible 
petroleum wells ; and at Goderich and Kincardine are valuable salt wells. 
Large peat beds exist in many parts of the province. An enormous lum- 
ber trade is carried on in the province, and the chief lumber districts are 
the Muskoka region and the waters of the Ottawa. Settlement has up 
to a late date been made only south of the Laurentian Uange, but behind 
these hills there is an extensive tract of rich agricultural land as level as 
the St. Lawrence valley and timbered with a heavy growth of mixed white 
pine and hardwood. Settlement is pouring in now upon the new district. 
Enormous strides in railway development have been made in the past thirty 
years, and the province has now upwards of 4,000 miles of railway. There 
are several canals in the province ; the Welland between Lakes Erie and 
Ontario to avoid the Niagara Falls, the Rideau between Kingston and 
Ottawa, and the St. Lawrence Canals necessitated by the rapids of the

(Treat river. The system of education is excellent, affording to rich and 
poor alike the means of free schooling. The schools are supported by a 
tax on property supplemented by aid from the provincial funds. The 
Roman Catholics have separate schools in the cities and large towns, but 
in the sparsely settled districts there is only the mixed free school. There 
is a normal school at Toronto disigned to perfect teachers in the profession 
of teaching. There are numerous public institutions in the province 
chiefly under the care of the government ; for example, the lunatic asy- 
lums at Kingston, Toronto, London, Amherstburg and Orillia ; the reform- 
atory prison at Penetanguishene ; the asylum for the blind at Brantford ; 
the deaf and dumb asylum at Belleville ; the normal school, university 
collec*e and Osgoode Hall at Toronto. The Courts of Justice are the Queen'* 
Bench, Common Pleas and Chanceiy, each of which is presided over by a- 
Chief Justice and two assistants; and a Court of Error and Appeal composed 
of a president and the j udges of superior courts of law and eq uity. In each 
county is a County Court, presided over by a County Court Judge. All 
the judges are appointed and paid by the Dominion government. The 
judges of the Superior Court go on circuit to each county of the province 
twice in the year to hold assizes for the trial of civil and crimiaal cases. 
The judges of the Court of Cnancery hold thsir courts in various counties 
as well as in Osgoode Hall. There are five episcopal dioceses in the 
province, Toronto, Niagara, Ontario, Huron and Algoma; and five Roman 
Catholic Dioceses : Toronto, Ottawa, Kingston, Hamilton and London. The 
largest, and in all respects the most important city in Ontario is Toronto, 
the capital of the province. The city with the late added suburbs now 
numbers not far short of 100,000 souls. It has a fine situation on Lake 
Ontario, is handsomely and regularly built, and contains a number of 
handsome and costly buildings. Ottawa, the capital of the Dominion, is 
beautifully situated on the river of the same name. It contains the 
parliament buildings, one of the most imposing edifices on the continent. 
Kingston is a well built and fortified city with a delightful situation at 
the outlet of Lake Ontario. Hamilton is an active commercial city at the 
id of navigation on Lake Ontario. London is a prosperous inland 
city in the centre of the Western Peninsula. Guelph and Brantford are 
also active and full of promise. Ontario contains many spots of interest 
to the tourist. Besides the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence, and 
tlie unrivalled scenery of the great lakes, there are the Falls of Niagara, 
the Falls of Kakabikki on the River Kaministiquia, thirty miles from its 
outlet at the head of Lake Superior. The sound of the latter falls 
resembles the roar of distant thunder and the rumbling of an earthquake. 



20 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Every year large numbers of immigrants settle in Ontario, and in addition 
to the Dominion immigration agencies, there is also a provincial immigra- 
tion office in Toronto. The existence of Ontario as the old province of 
Upper Canada begins at 1791, previous to which it formed part of the 
province of Quebec. Major-General J. G. Simcoe, was the first lieutenant- 
governor ; and the first parliament met at Niagara on September 17th, 
1792. In 1820 political dissentions arose in Lower Canada, which opened 
a gulf between the French and the English colonies. In 1837 the discon- 
tent took another form, and broke forth in rebellion. In 1841, a union 
between Ontario and Quebec, then known as Upper and Lower Canada, 
was again effected, and this union stood tiil 1867, when both the provin- 
ces were merged into confederation. The legislative machinery of the 
province consists of a lieutenant-governor, an executive council of five 
members, and a legislative assembly of eight elected every four years. 

QUEBEC. 

This province is bounded on the north by Labrador and Hudson's Bay ; 
on the east by Labrador and the Gulf of St. Lawrence ; on the South 
by Baie des Chaleurs, New Brunswick and the State of Maine ; on the 
south-east by New Hampshire, Vermont and New York, and on the south- 
west by the river Ottawa and the province of Ontario. Its length from 
Lake Temiscamingue to Anse au Blanc Sablon, in the Strait of Belle 
Isle, is about 1,000 miles and from the above-named lake to Cape Gaspe" 
is about 700 miles ; breadth about 300 miles ; giving a total area in land 
and water of about 193,300 square miles. The surface of the country 
consists of boundless forests, great rivers and lakes, considerable prairie 
stretches, bold rocky heights and the clear-spots of civilization. The 
principal mountain ranges are the Notre Dame and Green Mountains, 
which stretch in parallel lines from S. W. to N. E. The rocky masses 
connected with the mountain chain that line the St. Lawrence advance in 
many places close to the river and form precipitous cliffs from 200 to 300 
feet high. The province is richly endowed with mines of gold, copper, 
iron and other ores. Gold is found chiefly on the banks of the Chaudie"re. 
Copper is found in large quantities in the eastern townships. Iron is 
found in several districts, and it is almost entirely free from phosphorus. 
Lead, silver, zinc, platinum, &c., also occur in various sections of the pro- 
vince. The St. Lawrence flows through Quebec, receiving just above 
Montreal the Ottawa, a river 800 miles long. Below Montreal, on the 
right, it receives the Richelieu river which has its origin in Lake Cham- 



THE DOMINION* OF CANADA. 21 

plain ; the St. Frances, rising in Lake Memphremigog, and the Chaudie're 
at the outlet of Lake Megantic ; and, on the left, it receives the St. 
Maurice, the Batiscan and the Saguenay rivers. The climate of Quebec is 
warmer than that of Ontario in summer and colder than that of the latter 
in winter. The soil is generally rich and adapted to the growth of cereals, 
hay and green crops ; apples and plums, grow in abundance. A large por- 
tion of the province is covered with forest, consisting for the greater part 
of white and red pine. The other kinds of timber are ash, birch, beech, 
elm, hickory, black walnut, maple, cherry, butternut, basswood, spruce, fir, 
&c. There are now not far from 2,000 miles of railway in operation in 
the province. For judicial purposes the province is divided into 20 dis- 
tricts each district having ample and equal jurisdiction in all matters 
except as to revision and appeal. The superior court sits in revision only 
at Montreal and Quebec. Public instruction is under control of the su- 
perintendent of education who is assisted by a deputy and a council of 
twenty-one members. Two-thirds of these are Roman Catholics, one-third 
Protestants. There are separate schools, and a normal school for training 
teachers. The Protestant universities are McGill College, at Montreal, 
founded in 1827, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, founded in 1843. 
The Roman Catholic university of Laval was founded by the Quebec 
Seminar}' in 1852. The Roman Catholic dioceses are seven in number : 
the arch-diocese of Quebec, and the dioceses of Montreal, Three Rivers, 
Ste. Hyacinthe, Sherbrooke, Rimouski, and Chicoutimi. The Protestant 
dioceses are two in number : Montreal and Quebec. The four principal 
cities are Montreal, population, 140,747 ; Quebec, 62,4*6 ; Three Rivers, 
8,670 ; and Sherbrooke, 7,227. The chief manufactures of the province are 
cloth, linen, furniture, leather, sawn lumber, flax, paper, hardware, chemi- 
cals, soap, boots and shoes, cotton and woollen goods, steam engines and 
locomotives, wooden ware of all descriptions, agricultural implements, ships, 
i)cc. There are ample water-power facilities for manufacturing. Public 
affairs are administered by a lieutenant-governor, an executive council of 
seven members, a legislative council of thirty-four members appointed for 
life, and a legislative assembly of sixty-five members. There is a court of 
Queen's Bench with a chief justiceand five assistants; a Superior Court with 
chiefjusticeand twenty-eight assistants; acourt of vice-admiralty ; courts of 
quarter sesions, and courts for the summary trial of small cases. There are 
several canals which greatly facilitate commerce : Lachine, extending from 
Montreal to Lake St. Louis ; the Beauharnois uniting Lake St. Francis and 
St. Louis ; the Chambly uniting Lake Champlain and the Richelieu river. 
Among the points of interest to the tourist are the Chaudie're Falls, the

Indian name of which is Kanago " the Boiling Pot ; " the Falls of Mont- 
morency, seven miles below Quebec ; the gloomy, sullen Saguenay river 
rolling cold between its rocky walls, and numerous other points of de- 
lightful resort. Sebastian Cabot, it is said, discovered the province in 
1497 ; but Jacques Cartier made the first settlement near Quebec, in 1541. 
Up till 1760, when "Wolfe conquered Quebec, the country was held by the 
French. In 1792 the province was divided into Upper and Lower Can- 
ada ; in 1841 these were re-united; but in 1867 both were merged in 
confederation. 

NOVA SCOTIA, 

originally known as Acadia, is a long narrow peninsula fronting on the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence. The country is beautifully variegated by ranges 
of lofty hills and broad valleys, both of which run longitudinally through 
the province. Its Atlantic frontier is composed of poor soil, though 
it has some valuable gold and other mineral deposits. Along parts of 
the Bay of Fundy extends a ridge of mural precipice from 100 to 600 
feet high. Bej-ond this barrier lies the rich valley of Annapolis and 
the Basin of Minas, celebrated in Longfellow's " Evangeline." Nova 
Scotia covers an area of about 3,000 square miles. The principal lakes 
are Rossignal twenty miles long, and Ship Harbour lake fifteen miles long. 
These are on the main-land. Cape Breton, separated from the mainland 
by the Strait of Canso, is also part of the province. Here are several large 
lakes. The great Bras d'Or is a magnificent expanse of water fifty miles 
long, of great depth, and abounding with valuable fishes. On Cape Breton 
are located valuable coal mines, the most important of these being at 
Sydney. There are several rivers navigable for distances varying from two 
to twenty miles. The most remarkable body of water in the province is the 
Basin of Minas, the east arm of the Bay of Fundy, penetrating sixty miles 
inland. The tides rush in here with great violence and form what is 
known as a " bore." At the high tides they sometimes rise from forty to 
fifty feet; while in Halifax harbour, on the opposite side, the spring tide 
rises only from six to eight feet. The province possesses valuable re- 
sources in gold, iron, copper, silver, lead and coal. The quantity of iron 
belonging to the Londonderry iron company is inexhaustible ; and the 
product is as good as the best Swedish. Agates, amethysts, jaspers, chal- 
cedonies and cairngorms abound in the amaydaloidal trap along the 
Bay of Fundy. The climate is temperate; the thermometer seldom 
goes 20 below zero ; and the heat seldom reaches 98" above zero in the 
shade. The springs are tedious ; but the summer heat for a brief season 



THE DOMINION OF CANADA. 23 

is excessive ; the autumn is delightful. The vegetation is rapid, and hay, 
oats Indian corn, buckwheat, wheat, barley, potatoes, turnips, and other 
Drains and roots thrive well ; while fruit is successfully produced, 
apple orchards of Annapolis and King's County extend along the roadside 
in an unbroken line for fifty miles. Fogs haunt the coast line, and make 
the summer weather chill. Manufactures are limited ; but of late cotton 
and sucrar have been added to the list of coarse cloths, flannels, blankets, 
tweeds, &c. The province has a coast line of 1,000 miles, all along which the 
fisheries are carried on. Next to agriculture, fishing is the great industry. 
The bays, harbours and inland lakes yield salmon, cod, halibut, haddock, 
mackerel! herring, shad, lobster, &c. There are also some oyster beds 
Shipbuilding is extensively engaged in ; and in some years ships with an 
aacrrecmte of 53,000 tons are built. There are over 500 miles of railway 
in operation in the province. The Intercolonial, a Government road, runs 
from Halifax to Amherst, 138 miles, thence proceeding onward to 
John, N. B., and Riviere du Loup. There are two canals, one from Hali- 
fax to Cobequid Bay, the other connecting St. Peter's Bay, on the Atlantic 
coast of Cape Breton, with Great Bras d'Or Lake. The chief city is Hali- 
fax population, 36,100 The harbour is the tines) 

the continent, and protected by a fortress armed with batteries of three 
and six hundred-pounder Armstrong rifled guns. Habitation is accessible 
in nearly every case by rail or steamboat. Education is free, the non- 
sectarian school system prevailing. The chief seats of learning are Dal- 
housie College and University, St. Mary's College (B. C.), Presbyterian 
Colle-e Halifax, Acadia College (Baptist), at Wolfville, St. Francis Col- 
lege (B C), Antigonish, and King's College and University (Church of 
England), Windsor. Nova Scotia has little timber or agricultural lands 
now to offer to settlers ; so that increase must come from within herself 
The province was visited by John Cabot and his son, Sebastian, in 1497 ; 
was colonized in 1604 by De Monte, a Frenchman. In 1713 the country 
was ceded to the English by the French. In 1763 the Island of Cape 
Breton was annexed ; in 1784 the Province of New Brunswick was created 
out of Nova Scotia (Acadia), and in 1867 Nova Scotia became a province 
of the Dominion of Canada. 

NEW BRUNSWICK 

is bounded on the N. W. by Quebec, N. by Baie des Chaleurs, E. by the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence and Northumberland Strait, S. by the Bay < 
Fundy and a part of Nova Scotia, and on the W. by the State of Maine. 



24 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

The greatest length from north to south is 230 miles ; greatest breadth, 
190 miles; area, 27,322 square miles. The surface is generally flat or 
undulating. The shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the waters of 
the St. John, Restigouche, Miramichi, Richibucto, and Ste. Croix rivers 
contain valuable tracts of spruce and pine timber. All these rivers 
mentioned are large, and the St. John, 450 miles long, is navigable for 
100-ton vessels to Fredericton, ninety miles from the sea. Shallow- 
bottomed steamers run thence a hundred miles further up the river. Two 
hundred and twenty miles up the river is a magnificent cataract known 
as Grand Falls, about eighty feet high. The valley of the St. John is ex- 
ceedingly fertile, and salmon, bass, pickerel, mackerel, and other valuable 
fishes are found in them in considerable number. The chief industry of the 
province is agriculture, next lumbering, then fishing, and after that manu- 
factures. There are some valuable mineral deposits found in the " min- 
eral belt " skirting the southern coast, and then striking northerly. The 
lakes are numerous, the principal one being Grand Lake, thirty miles long, 
and two to seven miles wide. This communicates with the river St. John, 
fifty miles from the sea. Coal is plentiful, and iron is abundant. Cop- 
per and manganese also abound. The valuable bituminous deposit in Al- 
bert county produces for every ton of coal 100 gallons of crude oil. There 
is no country on the continent more bountifully wooded and watered, and 
the soil is exceeding fertile. The climate is subject to extremes of heat 
and cold. All kinds of crops grow and ripen well. There are several 
manufactures in operation of late years. There is a free non-sectarian 
system of education ; and, like in Nova Scotia, educational affairs are 
administered by a chief superintendent and a board of education. There 
is no minister of education, as in Ontario, and the system works admir- 
ably. There are about 1,400 Indians in the province, chiefly Micmacs 
and Milecites. The government is administered by a lieutenant-governor, 
and an executive of nine members ; there is a legislative council of eigh- 
teen members, and a house of assembly of forty-one members, the latter 
elected every four years. There is a supreme court, with a chief justice 
and four puisne judges having jurisdiction in law and equity ; a marriage 
and divorce court ; a vice-admiralty court ; and a county court for eacli 
county. There is a large quantity of excellent settlement land yet in the 
province ; and extensive timber areas. The province was settled by the 
French in 1639. It fell into the hands of the British after the conquest 
of Quebec. In 1867 it joined the Confederation. Shipbuilding is one of 
its important industru ^. 




"III 

RIGHT HON. SIR JOHN A. MACDONALD, K.C.B., 
PRIME MINISTER OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA. 



THE DOMINION OF CANADA. 25 

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND. 

This little province, formerly called St. John's Island, lies in the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence, and is washed on the north by the Gulf, and separated 
from New Brunswick on the east, and Nova Scotia on the south, by North- 
umberland Strait. It is 130 miles long; its breadth is 34 miles, though 
at its narrowest part it is but 4 miles wide. The total area is 21,134 miles. 
The surface undulates gently. At one time the land was covered with a 
dense forest of beech, birch, maple, poplar, cedar ; and some of the original 
forest still remains. The soil is a light reddish loam, and is exceedingly 
fertile. The chief crops are wheat, barley and oats, and these are pro- 
duced in heavy crops. The winter is long and cold ; but the summer is 
delightful and rapidly brings the crops to maturity. The fisheries arc 
valuable ; and the north coast is visited by cod and mackerel, sometimes 
in abundance. Ship-building is an important industry in the island. 
There is a lieutenant-governor, an executive council of five members, and 
a legislative assembly of twenty-two representatives. Justice is adminis- 
tered according to the English law and practice. The free non-sectarian 
school system, as in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, prevails. Besides 
the public schools there are St. Dunstan's College (Roman Catholic) and 
Prince of Wales' College (Protestant). The Lord Bishop of Nova Scotia 
exercises episcopal authority over the island, but the Roman Catholics 
have the diocese of Charlottetown. Charlottetown is the chief city and 
the capital ; and has a population of over 10,000. Georgetown and Sum- 
merside are the other chief towns. This island was among Cabot's 
earliest discoveries ; but in 1663 it was granted to Sieur Doublet, a 
French naval officer. It was taken by the British in 1755, restored by 
the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, retaken and finalty ceded to Great Britain 
in 1758. In 1768 it was erected into a separate government; in 1773 
the first house of assembly met, and in 1799 the name of St. John was 
changed to Prince Edward, in compliment to Edward, Duke of Kent, who 
that summer had visited the island. In 1873 it joined, after a tit of 
stubborness, the Canadian confederation. 

BRITISH COLUMBIA. 

This province is the Pacific sister of the confederation. It is bounded 
north by the 60th parallel of latitude, east by the main chain of the 
Rocky Mountains ; south by the United States, and west by Alaska, the 
Pacific Ocean and Queen Charlotte's Sound. The area is 350,000 square 
miles. The coast-line is deeply indented ; the northern part of the

colony is diversified by mountain, lake and river, and is of extraordi- 
nary fertility, producing in abundance cereals, vegetables and fruit. 
The rich gold-valley of the Fraser River is a good pastural region, 
and with irrigation would be excellent for agriculture. There are large 
forest districts through the province, the timber of which is very valu- 
able. The Douglas pine yields spars from 90 to 100 feet long, and 
20 to 24 feet in diameter. Often a tree 300 feet long without knot or 
blemish is found. At Burrard Inlet, 9 miles from New Westminster, 
there are pine trees from 27 to 30 feet in diameter. The natural resour- 
ces are very valuable. Gold is found on the Fraser and Thompson rivers 
and in the Cariboo district, while the yield of the province for the past 
thirteen years is valued at nearly 828,000,000. There are also valuable 
silver and copper mines. There are extensive and valuable coal beds, 
easy of access. The fisheries are valuable, and one of the chief industries. 
The climate is mild, and cattle can stay on the plains and among the hills 
during the winter without housing. Winter lasts from November till 
March ; but snow seldom remains long on the ground. Wheat, barley, 
potatoes, turnips, apples, pears, &c., grow luxuriantly. The province, too, 
is rich in fur-bearing animals, among these being black, brown and griz- 
zly bears, lynx, marten, fox and beaver. The chief rivers are the Fraser, 
which pursues a rapid course between steep and rocky banks, until, ap- 
proaching the sea, it presents a fertile and richly wooded valley from fifty 
to sixty miles in length. The Fraser is 700 miles long. The Thompson sur- 
passes the latter in richness of scenery ; and it flows through one of the 
most beautiful countries in the world. Steamers ascend the Fraser for 100 
miles ; and beyond the terminus a government gravel road begins, and 
extends up the river for 450 miles. Burrard Inlet is an excellent harbour, 
and Port Moody, one of its inlets, will be the terminus of the Canada Paci- 
fic Eailway. Public affairs are in the hands of a lieutenant-governor and 
an executive of five members ; a legislative assembly of twenty-five 
members, elected every four years. Victoria, the capital, has a popu- 
lation of 5,925. The colony was first established in 1858. A large 
number of Chinese, attracted by railway building, have settled in the pro- 
vince. Some came direct from China, others from California and other 
parts of the American Pacific coast. The Canada Pacific railway in 
course of construction, is intended to connect British Columbia with the 
eastern provinces. There are large areas of first-rate agricultural lands 
in the hands of the government, which makes the province suitable for 
immigration, and large districts of timber.

MANITOBA 



i, bounded on the S. by the United States, and on the N E. and W. by 
the North-West Territories of the Dominion. Area, 14,340 square miles. 
The name Manitoba is a contraction made by the French Canadian voy- 
aqeurs of the Cree word Manitowaban. Manito signifies a spirit and 
Waban means a strait: as the waters of a strait in Lake Mam oba 
are excited sometimes in an unusual way the Indians believed hat 
some mighty water-sprite moved them, and so they called the lake 
Manito-waban. The soil is exceeding fertile. The greater part of the pro- 
vince is one huge sweep of rolling prairie, covered with long wavy gra* 
and wild-flowers, and every here and there clumps of poplar, white oak am 
other trees. Wheat ripens in 110 days and yields from twenty to twenty- 
five bushels to the acre, all kinds of garden vegetables grow luxuriantly, 
M does fruit, and all the cereals known to Canada. Theclimate is sever, 
in winter so that the mercury sometimes freezes ; but the air i; 
and the bitterest nights often are so deathly calm, that the intense frost is 
not felt so keenly. Fierce blizzards sometimes sweep over the bleak pn 
often unroofing houses and barns. The largest lakes are Winnipeg and 
Manitoba, the former 280 miles long, and from five to fifty-seven miles 
wide the latter 110 miles long and twenty-five miles wide. V mnipeg 
the capital and has a population of 7,985. There are two bishopric 
that of St. Boniface, Roman Catholic, and Rupert's Land, Church of 
hod The bishop lives at St. John, near Winnipeg. Public affairs are m 
the hands of a lieutenant-governor, an executive of five members, a legis 
lative council of seven and a house of assembly. The province has 
colleges, St. John's, Church of England ; St. Boniface, Roman Catholic ; 
Kildonan Presbyterian; besides anumberof convents andschools. In A 
1869 the Hudson Bay Company surrendered to the Imperial Qovernmei 
their' territorial rights and governing responsibility in the North-\ 
and on July 16th, 1870, England handed over the territory to Canad 
was then that took place the Red River rebellion; and after some time 
Manitoba entered the confederation. Development has begun in ] 
toba at an astonishing rate. Immigrants are flocking in from all quar 
ters and the Canada Pacific railway will soon join the province to tl 
skirt of the rocky mountains. The great drawback is scarcity < 
and the water in some regions is brackish, being diluted with salts. 

* The figures of population given for Winnipeg, are those of the census of 1881. Tb popu- 
lation now is said to be about 25,000.

XORTH-WEST TERRITORIES. 

This extensive and valuable region, though yet not erected into pro- 
vinces, being the great heritage of Canada, and the future home of mil- 
lions of immigrants, deserves mention in speaking of the confederation. 
The territories include all the British possessions on the northern part 
of the American continent outside of those provinces named. The area 
is estimated at the enormous figure of 2,750,000 square miles. Till 1870 
this region was known as the Hudson Bay Territory, from Henry Hud- 
son, who discovered the Bay in 1610, and perished on its shores. Till 
1870, when the country became part of the Dominion of Canada, it was 
governed by the Hudson Bay company. There are numerous lakes and 
rivers in the territory, the principal rivers being the Nelson, Severn, 
Abbitibbi, East Main and Great Whale, all flowing into the Hudson's 
Bay ; the Mackenzie, Coppermine, and Great Fish, flowing into the Arctic 
Ocean; the Saskatchewan, Assiniboine and Red River, falling into Lake 
Winnipeg, and the Koksoak and Natwatkaine, into Hudson's Straits. 
The Mackenzie, one of the greatest rivers in the world, is 2,500 miles 
>ong, and flows through a fertile and finely wooded country and skirted 
by metalliferous hills_ and coal measures. The country is rich in the 
various minerals, and contains wide areas of pine. In the far north are 
long dreary stretches of muskeg. The agricultural capabilities of at least 
60,000 square miles, are great. The Saskatchewan country is of unri- 
valled fertility, and is estimated to be capable of supporting 90,000,000 
of people. The winters are severe, but in the delightful summers abun- 
dant crops of roots, grain and fruits are produced. The Canada Pacific 
runs through the Saskatchewan country, and various other railroads are 
projected through the territories. Settlers and cattle ranchers flock 
every year into the region.

* The indicated decrease of the population of the City of St. John is attributable to the great fire which oc- 
curred in the year 1377, when half of the city was laid in ashes. Great numbers were thereby driven into the 
turrounding districts, and many whose business and social ties were thus severed did not return to the city.

i. 

DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY. 

' HE first thing which should be taught a child is obedience, 
and after that should come reverence. 

It is very hard to teach a child reverence. His parents 
must be people of remarkable force of character if they 
succeed in doing so, for the tendency of free institutions 
on this continent is against him. 

The newly arrived immigrant defeats the idea ; for he 
soon learns, as the beginning of his political career, that 
his vote is as good as his master's perhaps better. Thus 
the good old relation between master and servant, of respect on the one 
hand and help on the other the best relation for the benefit of home- 
is uprooted at once. 

Almost the first impression on a young child's mind is, perhaps, of the 
rudeness of a servant to his mother. He sees that her orders are not 
obeyed, that she is powerless to enforce them. No child likes to obey. 
He may love his mother of course he does better than anything, but 
when a conflict of opinion comes, he prefers his own will. A strong and 
conscientious mother will compel her child to obey; a weak and conscien- 
tious mother will not be able to do so. He sees that Sarah does not obey, 
why should he? The child goes to school. There he is taught routine, but 
not reverence. He is not especially reverential to his teachers ; nor is he 
taught that obedience to superior rank or station which is a part of the 
education of a foreigner. 

Therefore he has no inherited nor early inculcated reverence. He has 
good instincts, he has learned to tell the truth, he is energetic and indus- 
trious, perhaps ; but a French boy would be shocked at the manners of 
the young American or Canadian son to his mother, even had the boy all 
the other virtues which he respects. Nothing in this imperfect world is 
so beautiful as the relation of a French son to his mother. He sees her 
from his first sentient look the being whom every one in the house adores. 



34 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

Does the nurse or the maid speak even sharply to the mistress of the 
house, she is immediately discharged. The child would thus see his mo- 
ther's authority verified from the first, and, whatever we may say on this 
side of the water of the marriage relation in France, the master of the 
house certainly compels a sort of respect from his servants and children 
toward the mother and mistress of the house, which goes far toward mak- 
ing the manners of a nation respectful and polite. 

From the cradle to the grave a French son has one duty, one affection, 
which is paramount to all others that is, his love for his mother. As a 
child, as a boy, he treats her with perfect respect and obedience. As a 
young man, he delights to send her flowers, to take her to the theatres and 
cafe's. It is a common sight in Paris to see a young man with a gray- 
haired woman at the public galleries and places of amusement, apparently 
perfectly happy with each other, the young man studying to make his 
mother comfortable and amused. Often, in leaving France, a young man 
asks of his family the privilege of taking his mother with him as his " guide, 
philosopher, and friend." Before his marriage is arranged, she is his con- 
stant companion and his best adviser. Never until death separates them 
does he fail in his duty toward her ; and, after that event has closed this 
sweet, dutiful history, he keeps the anniversary of her death as his most 
sacred day, and visits her grave with his children to dress it with flowers. 

A young Canadian, of even the kindest heart and manners, seldom treats 
his mother with much outward attention. He may, if necessary, work for 
her ; he would be shocked if he heard that he had been guilty of any 
neglect of even the most remote duty to her. But he gives her no small 
attentions, such as sending her flowers, helping her in work, greeting her 
in the morning, taking her for a drive. Nothing is so rare as to see a 
young gentleman in attendance upon his mother. Even his manner of 
speaking to her is harsh and impolite. He goes to her for money, if his 
father does not give it to him, but he is very indifferent as to his manner 
of asking for it ; he is full of reproaches if she does not give it to him. 

The men of this continent respect women in the highest sense, and treat 
them with all the chivalry possible, as far as immunity from insult is con- 
cerned. The national character of the Canadian in this respect is above 
reproach. But are they at home amiable and polite ? Do they treat their 
wives and daughters or their mothers with constant and daily, and proper 
politeness ? Are Canadian women models in this respect ? Do they remem- 
ber to be grateful, polite, in little matters of salutations and of compli- 
ment ? Are they careful to be good-humoured, and to bring only an amia- 
ble face to the dinner-table ? 



DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY. 35 

We are afraid not. The national manners need improving. The ameni- 
ties of home can alone make up for the national disadvantage. It is at the 
home dinner-table, by the hearth-stone, the evening fireside, in the nursery, 
the bed -room and the sick-room, that manners must be taught. 

Between parents and children there should never, even with the fondest 
love, be the slightest relaxation in the matter of a respectful obedience. It 
is not now, as it was in the days of our own fathers and mothers, the fashion 
to be formally respectful. The son does not rise when his father enters 
the room, or' stop speaking because his father is speaking. Perhaps it 
would be' better if he did. But he can be taught that he should treat his- 
father differently from other men. He can be taught to rise when his- 
mother leaves the table. He can be taught, by looks rather than by words, 
to assume a certain respectful tone. Undoubtedly, the harassed and trou- 
bled woman of the New World old before her time ; obliged to rush 
against wind and tide, full of cares which pursue her like scorpions, em- 
barrassed by ill-trained servants would have a wrinkle less on her fore- 
head, if she could be treated with a little more respect by her sons and 
daughters ; and certainly she would be no less happy if her grown-up son 
would now and then take her to the theatre or to a picture-gallery, and 
would not impress it on her mind that she is an old woman, and therefore 
to be left to the solitude of her own thoughts. 

How does her mind go back to those days when she with sleepless soli- 
citude watched his helplessness ! How does she think of her patient work 
by his bedside when he was ailing ! Does he ever wish to sit down and 
nurse her when she is ill ? He may say that the affections never go back- 
ward ; but, at least, he might remember what she has done for him how 
she brought home the Christmas-tree, which she decked for him ; not for- 
getting his daily amusements, how she sought to make his life an endless 
succession of delights ; how she wrought, in sickness and in health, at his 
" little coat," that he might be fine ; and how proud she was of him, when, 
after her teaching, he took the prize at school. 

Now, wrapped in his own pleasures, or business, or love, how often 
does he think of her or her pleasure ? Does he try to make her happy 
her own way the only way in which we can any of us be happy ? No, 
the son does not treat his mother with much politeness as a general rule ; 
nor do her daughters always err on the side of too much^delicate devotion, 
or err with a too respectful manner. 

We have no power to write a counter-irritant to " Daisy Miller," whose 
mother was the last person to be informed of the engagement of her 
daughter. There are many mothers who constitute themselves the upper 






gg THE HOME, FAJiM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

servants of their daughters, and who consider the daughter as the best 
judge of her own actions. Such a mother must, of course, take the conse- 
quences of her own folly, and bear with whatever sort of treatment her 
daughter chooses to give her. We can not make them over such unwise 
mothers. 

But for the future there is always hope. We can begin with a young 
home, a young mother ; and from experience, and from the memory of 
mistakes, we can try to teach a better code, feeling sure that, when mothers 
appreciate how far-reaching are the amenities of home, they will try to 
make the nursery the infant school, as the parlour and dining-room should 
be the college and university, of a new and an improved system of national 
manners. 

n. 

A SUBTILE SYMPATHY. 

IN order to make home happy to a child, he should never be laughed at. 
The chaotic view of life which presents itself to a child, we can all re- 
member ; how .we only half understood things, or how we misapprehended 
them altogether ; how formalists wearied us, and gave us texts which we 
could not remember ; and how the hasty and the heartless trampled down 
the virgin buds of good resolve and of heroic endeavour. Our early heart- 
breaks are never quite forgotten, nor can we recall them without tears. 
They are, of course, a part of the forging of the armour. We have to be 
hammered into shape by all sorts of hard blows before we ore good for 
anything. The only thing we can ask is that the strokes be so well given 
that we are not bent awry ; that the character does not receive some fatal 
twist from which it never recovers. 

" He comes, and lays my heart all heated 

On the hard anvil, minded so 
Into his own fair shape to beat it 

With his great hammer, blow on blow ; 
And yet I whisper, ' As God will !' 
And at his heaviest blows lie still. 

" He takes my softened heart, and beats it, 

The sparks fly off at every blow ; 
He turns it o'er and o'er and beats it, 

And lets it cool and makes it glow ; 
And yet I whisper, ' As God will '. ' 
And in his mighty hatid lie still." 

We are all on God's anvil, to be thus moulded, but, in a lesser degree, 
our children are in our hands to be shaped into the image of their Maker. 



A SUBTILE SYMPATHY. 37 

Shall we, in addition to all the sorrows which must come to them later, 
afflict them in their sensitive childhood with our scorn, our ridicule, or our 
lack of comprehension ? 

A child will not, for some inscrutable reason, tell the secrets of its soul. 
It will not let us know when we hurt it, and how. We must be careful, 
through sympathy and through memory, to find that art. 

One of the most powerful sketches of a child's sufferings is to be found 
in George Eliot's Maggie Tulliver, in the " Mill on the Floss." Many a 
grown man or woman, on reading that, has said, " It is a picture of my early 
sufferings. Poor Maggie ? " 

A sullen temper gives to a mother an almost incurable obstacle in the 
way of good manners, and yet a sullen temper is very often an affectionate 
temper soured. 

It pains a mother often after her children have grown up to hear them 
say that their childhood was an unhappy one ; that they were never un- 
derstood ; that she laughed when she should have been serious, and was 
serious when she should have laughed ; that they had terrors by night 
which she never drove away ; and that their mortifications by day were 
increased by her determination that they should wear broad collars instead 
of narrow ones, such as the other boys wore, and so on. She can only say, 
" I did my best, I did my best for you," and regret that she had not been 
inspired. 

But while the children are young, as indeed after they are grown, a 

parent should try to sympathize with the various irregular growths of a 

child's nature. Sensitiveness as to peculiarities of dress is a very strong 

element, and it can not be laughed down. The late Lydia Maria Child 

said, that she believed her character had been permanently injured by the 

laughter of her schoolmates at a peculiar short-waisted gown which her 

mother made her wear to school. And a very sensible mother, who would 

not allow her little daughter to wear a hoop to a dancing-school, when 

hoops were the fashion, said that she was certain that, by the mortification 

she had caused her, and the undue attention which had been given to the 

subject, she had made love of dress a passion with the child. On all these 

questions, a certain wholesome inattention is perhaps the best treatment. 

Try to allow your child to be as much like his fellows as you can ; and, 

above all things, do not make him too splendid, for that hurts his feelings 

more than anything, and makes the other boys laugh at him. 

The ragged jacket, the poor shoes, the forlorn cap, the deciduous panta- 
loon which has shed the leaves of freshness these are not laughed at ; 
they do not move the youthful soul to ridicule. It is a lovely trait in the 



38 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

character of boyhood that poverty is no disgrace. But a velvet jacket, a 
peculiar collar, hair cut in a singular fashion, long hair especially these 
are cruel guide-posts to the young bully. He makes the picturesque wearer 
whose prettiness delights his mother to suffer for this peculiar grace most 
fearfully. 

Little girls, more precocious than boys, suffer, however, less from the 
pangs of ridicule ; yet they have their sorrows. An intelligent and poetical 
girl is laughed at for her rhapsodies, her fine language, or her totally inno- 
cent exaggerations. She gets the name of fib-teller, when she is perhaps 
but painting a bluer sky or describing a brighter sun than her fellow- 
beings can see. But a little girl has generally a great deal of vanity to 
help her along, and much tact to tell her where to go, so that her suffer- 
ings are less severe than those of a boy. She gravitates naturally towards 
the amenities, and, if she is not a well-bred person, it is largely the fault 
of her surroundings. 

m. 

EDUCATION AND MANNEES OF GIELS. 

WE come now to the subject which perhaps has only remotely to do with 
the amenities of home, but much to do with the welfare of the state. We 
must consider the two extremes which are now being brought about by 
the emancipation of young women. One is, their higher education, the 
other is, the growing " fastness " of manner. 

One can scarcely imagine amenity of manner without education, and yet 
we are forced to observe that it can exist, as we see the manners of highly 
educated, and what are called strong-minded women. Soft, gentle, and 
feminine manners do not always accompany culture and education. In- 
deed, pre-occupation in literary matters used to be supposed to unfit a 
woman for being a graceful member of society, but we have changed all 
that ; and we are now in the very midst of a well-dressed and well-man- 
nered set of women, who work at their pen as Penelope at her web. 

The home influence is, however, still needed for those young daughters 
who begin early to live in books ; and neatness in dress and order should 
be insisted upon by the mother of a bookish, studious girl. All students 
are disposed to be slovenly, excepting an unusual class, who, like the Count 
de Buffin, write in lace ruffles and diamond rings. Books are apt to soil 
the hands, and libraries, although they look clean, are prone to accumulate 
dust. Ink is a very permeating material, and creeps up under the middle 
finger-nail. To appear with such evidences of guilt upon one would make 
the prettiest woman unlovely. 







EDUCATION AND MANNERS OF GIRLS. 

The amenities of manner are not quite enough considered at some of 
our female colleges. With the college course the young graduates are apt 
to copy masculine manners. This is not graceful, and to some minds would 
more than balance the advantages of the severe course of study marked 
out and pursued at college. A mother with gentle and lady-like manners 
would however, soon counteract these masculine tendencies and overflow 
of youthful spirits. We all detest a man who copies the feminine style 
dress intonation, and gesture. Why should a girl be any more attractive 
who wears an ulster, a Derby hat, and who strides, puts her hands in her 
pockets and imitates her brother's style in walk and gesture ? 

However to a girl who is absorbed in books, who is reading, studying, 
and thinking, wecan forgive much if she only will come out a really cul- 
tivated woman. We know that she will be a power in the state, an adc 
tion to the better forces of our government; that she will be net only 
happy herself, but the cause of happiness in others. The cultivated woman 
is a much more useful factor in civilization, than the vain, silly, and 1 
pant woman, although the latter may be prettier. But it is a great pity 
that, having gone so far, she should not go further, and come out a <? 
vated flower, instead of a learned weed. 

Far more reprehensible and destructive of all amenities, is the growing 
tendency to "fastness," an exotic which we have imported from somewhere ; 
probably from the days of the Empire in Paris. 

It seems hardly possible that the " fast" woman of the present, whose 

fashion has been achieved by her questionable talk, her excessive dress, 

her doubtful manners, can have grown out of the same soil that produced 

Priscilla Mullins. The old Puritan Fathers would have turned the helm 

of the Mayflower the other way if they could have seen the product of one 

hundred years of independence on the- other side of the line. Now all 

Europe rings with the stories of American women, young, beautiful, charm- 

indy dressed, who live away from their husbands, flirt with princes, rnak, 

themselves the common talk of all the nations, and are delighted with 

their own notoriety. To educate daughters to such a fate seems to recall 

the story of the Harpies. Surely no mother can coolly contemplate it. And 

the amenities of home should be so strict and so guarded that this fate 

would be impossible. 

In the first place, young girls should not be allowed to walk in t. 
crowded streets alone ; a companion, a friend, a maid, should always be 
sent with them. Lady Thornton said, after one year's experience 
Washington, " I must bring on a very strict English governess to walk 
about with my girls." And in the various games so much in fashion now, 



40 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA.. 

such as skating and lawn-tennis, there is no doubt as much necessity for 
a chaperon as in attending balls and parties. Not alone that impropriety 
is to be checked, but that manners may be cultivated. A well-bred woman 
who is shocked at slang, and who presents in her own person a constant 
picture of good manners, is like the atmosphere, a presence which is felt, 
and who unconsciously educates the young persons about her. 

" I have never gotten over Aunt Lydia's smile," said a soldier on the 
plains, who, amid the terrible life of camp and the perils of Indian war- 
fare, had never lost the amenites of civilized life. " When a boy I used 
to look up at the table, through a long line of boisterous children clamour- 
ing for food, and see my Aunt Lydia's face. It never lost its serenity, 
and when things were going very wrong she had but to look at us and 
smile, to bring out all right. She seemed to say with that silent smile. 
' Be patient, be strong, be gentle, and all will come right.' " 

The maiden aunt was a perpetual benediction in that house, because of 
her manner ; it was, of course, the outcrop of a fine, well-regulated, sweet 
character; but supposing she had had the character with a disagreeable 
manner ? The result would have been lost. 

We have all visited in families where the large nock of children come 
forward to meet us with outstretched hand and ready smile. We have 
seen them at table, peaceful and quiet, waiting their turn. We have also 
visited in other houses where we have found them discourteous, sullen, ill- 
mannered, and noisy. We know that the latter have all the talent, the 
good natural gifts, the originality, and the honour of the former. We 
know that the parents have just as much desire in the latter case to bring 
up their children well, but where have they failed ? They have wanted 
firmness and an attention to the amenities. 

IV. 
RESPECT FOE THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. 

As boys and girls grow up to manhood and womanhood, parents should 1 
respect that nascent dignity which comes with the age they should re- 
spect individuality. It is one reason, perhaps, why sisters cannot always 
live together happily, that neither has been taught to respect the other's 
strong peculiarity of character, at least in outward manner. If we treated 
our brothers and sisters with the same respect that we treat our formal 
acquaintances in matters of friendship, opinion, and taste, there would be 
greater harmony in households.

HOME, SWEET HOME. 



RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. 41 

One of the first and most apparent duties is to respect a seal. Never 
open your /jhildren's letters after they are old enough to read them. It 
is a curious element of self-respect that this " community of letters " which 
exists in some families hurts the feelings of a young person from the first. 
Certain coarse-grained parents or relatives tear open Sam's letters from 
Dick and laugh at them. Certain other parents consider it a duty to open 
their daughter's love-letters. 

Perhaps in the attempt to keep a daughter from marrying improperly, 
any kind of warfare is allowable. Extraordinary circumstances make 
extraordinaiy precautions proper ; but it should be the last resort. No 
girl is made better by espionage. If she is a natural born intrigiiante,oo 
surveillance will defeat her (we are glad to go out of the honest English 
tongue to find words to express these hateful ideas). If she is, as are most 
girls, trembling in the balance between deceit and honesty, a fair, open deal- 
ing, a belief in her, will bring her all right. Do not set servants to watch 
her. Do not open her letters. Do not spy on her acts or abuse her 
friends. She will be far more apt to come right if she is treated as if she 
were certain to be true, frank, and honourable in all her acts. 

As for young boys and men, belief in their word, confidence in their 
honesty, is the way to make them honourable gentlemen. Be careful, as 
we have said before, not to laugh at them ; respect their correspondence. 
If the rough-and-tumble of a public school is to be their portion, there is 
no fear that the amenities of home will make them effete. They will need 
all their polish as they go knocking through the world. 

A husband should never open his wife's letters, or a wife her husband's. 
All people have their individual confidences which each is bound to re- 
spect. A woman of large sympathies and wise thoughts, of virtuous life 
and clear head, is sure to have considerable correspondence. Many weaker 
people write to her for advice, consolation, and help. It is an outrage 
upon their belief in her if her husband reads those letters. The correspon- 
dent is not telling her secrets to him. If a wife is carrying on a love 
affair, her husband may be quite sure that he will be baffled ; therefore 
his jealousy will not be gratified on opening her letters. Still less should 
a wife open her husband's letters. But we are not in the days of Othello 
and Desdemona, nor are we dealing with passions and jealousies; we are 
not treating with such questions as these. We will end this by repeating 
the old adage that " a seal is as strong as a lock." If the opening of 
letters is a fact which is treated carelessly in many families, it becomos a 
part of that thoughtless disregard of individuality which is remotely so 
much the cause of uuhappiness at home. " Did we but think." says the 



42 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

careless person. Exactly ! " Did we but remember." Yes ! To think, 
to remember, to consider the claims of all about us, particularly at home, 
is the beginning of " the amenities." 

One should be particular about paying small debts to members of the 
family. Tom borrows car-fare from Dick and forgets to return it. Sarah bor- 
rows a dollar from Louisa and forgets to return it. Then come recrimina- 
tions and strife. There should be, in the first place, an effort to avoid bor- 
rowing. Nothing is so good for children as to give them a small money 
allowance, and to insist upon its lasting. It teaches them economy and 
thrift. If this is possible, then instruct them in the impropriety of bor- 
rowing and the necessity of prompt payments. Of course this is all a part 
of the theory of respecting the rights of others. We are none of us too old 
or too perfect to be beyond instruction in this matter. 

And, in the education of the young, parents should encourage individu- 
ality. They should not try to smoothe off their children to a dead level 
of uniformity. If Flora can draw, put a pencil in her hand and encourage 
her. If Lucy can write, give her plenty of foolscap. If Bob wants to go 
to sea, let him strive to fit himself. If Arthur is a natural orator, bring 
him up for the law. If Charles is devotional, strive to fan the flame which 
may make him a preacher. If Herbert has a tendency to save his pennies, 
try in the first place to make him philanthropic, so that he will not end in 
being a miser ; but let him be educated to business. If Peter shows a de- 
cided taste for art, by all means cultivate it. We need artists in Canada, 
a,nd they are no longer struggling visionaries. 

Our education of girls tends chiefly toward making them admirable 
figures in society, and to a certain extent this is right. But, if she has 
nothing behind that worldly training, the young girl is apt, after a short 
worldly experience, either to violently react and to hate it all ; she either 
grows morbidly sensitive to opinion, or she stagnates into conventionality 
either of which extremes should be avoided. There is no sadder sight 
than to see our young women growing up with no high aims or thoughts 
to guide them. Society is her power. She is the future regenerator, the 
preserver of society. If her aims are high and pure, society will be high 
and pure. 

The sudden accession of wealth should not make people less well-man- 
nered. The pursuit of wealth is no doubt very destructive to good man- 
ners ; but when it is won, as it now is by so many on this continent, should 
it not bring back all those amenities, as we are bringing back the brocades, 
the bureaus, the old clocks, and the carved mantelpieces of our Canadian 
forefathers ? We are beginning to find out that they built better 



THE MODEL GIRL. 43 

houses in olden times than we do ; that they had more elegant interiors ; 
that their fireplaces are things to copy ; that there is no such furniture as 
their claw-footed mahogany chairs. And we should remember that the 
manners of those pretty great-grandmothers of ours, whom Copley painted, 
were as well worth our copying as are the chairs in which they sat or the 
fireplaces which they looked at. 

The picture of the old-time lady sitting in her parlour, to receive the 
hand-kiss from her sons and the respectful submission of her daughters- 
such a one of whom her son said, " You can not imagine my horror when 
I once believed, the next morning, that my mother had seen me drunk "- 
the dignified matron, who still, in her early morning deshabille, which was 
as neat and pretty as her afternoon silk was elegant, attended her house- 
hold duties, and taught her children the secrets of cookery ; she who was 
from youth to age a pattern of dignity and the domestic virtues, she is a 
vanished picture. 

The rich parvenu society, which, like a mushroom growth, follows sud- 
denly-acquired wealth, is now apt to be exceedingly fast and utterly rowd ,- 
Here and there, persons of native refinement and an intuitive sense of th 3 
becoming, endeavour to stem the tide ; but feebly, for the tides of fashion 
are like those which pour into the Bay of Fundy, irresistible, carrying all 
before them on their tremendous waves. Fastness and fashion and folly 
are cumulative, and, if one woman makes herself noticed by eccentric de- 
fiance of what was once considered decency, another, a thousand others, 
follow in her wake, thinking that this defiance is the thing. One beau- 
tiful " fast " woman who succeeds makes a hundred converts. 

V. 

THE MODEL GIRL. 

" I AM so glad I have no daughters," said a leader of society ; " for what 
should I do with them ? I should not wish to have them peculiar girk, 
dressed differently from their mates, or marked as either bookish girls, or 
prudish girls, or non-dancing girls, or anything queer ; and yet I could 
never permit them to go out on a coach, be out to the small hours of the 
night with no chaperon but a woman no older than themselves. I could 
not allow them to dance with notorious drunkards, men of evil life, gam- 
blers, and betting men ; I could not let them dress as many girls do whom 
I know and like ; so I am sure it is fortunate for me that I have no 
daughters. I could not see them treat my friends as so many of my 



44 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

friends' daughters treat me as if I were the scum of the universe. I am 
glad I have no daughters ; for a modern daughter would kill me." 

Perhaps this lady but elaborated the troublesome problem which has 
tried the intellects of all observant women how to make the proper 
medium girl ; not the " fast " girl ; still again, not the " slow," dowdy girl ; 
not the exceptional girl, but the girl who shall be at once good and suc- 
cessful that is the question ? 

The amenities of home, the culture of the fireside, the mingled duty and 
pleasure which come with a life which has already its duties before its 
pleasures this would seem to make the model girl. The care and inter- 
est in the younger sisters and brothers ; a comprehension and a sympathy 
with her mother's trials ; a devotion to her hard-worked father ; a desire to 
spare him one burden more, to learn the music he loves, to play to him 
of an evening ; to be not only the admired belle of the ballroom, but also 
the dearest treasure of home ; to help along the boys with their lessons, 
to enter into those trials of which they will not speak ; to take the fracti- 
ous baby from the patient or impatient nurse's arms, and toss it in her 
own strong young hands and smile upon it with her own pearly teeth and 
red lips ; to take what comes to her of gaiety and society as an outside 
thing, not as the whole of life ; to be not heartbroken if one invitation fail, 
or if one dress is unbecoming ; to bear the slight of no partner for the 
German with a smiling indifference ; to be cheerful and watchful ; to be 
fashionable enough, but neither fast nor furious ; to be cultivated, and not 
a blue-stocking ; to be artistic, but not eccentric or slovenly ; to be a lovely 
woman whom men love, and yet neither coquette nor flirt such would 
seem to be the model girl. 

And it is home and its amenities which must make her. School can 
not do it ; society can not and will not do it ; books will not do it, 
although they will help. 

And here we have much to say on the books which should surround a 
girl. We must seek and watch and try to find the best books for our 
girls, But we can no more prevent a bad French novel from falling into 
their hands than we can prevent the ivy which may poison them from 
springing up in the hedge. The best advice we can give, is to let a girl 
read as she pleases in a well-selected library; often reading with her, re- 
commending certain books, and forming her taste as much as possible ; 
then leaving her to herself, to pick out the books she likes. Nothing will 
be so sure to give a girl a desire to read a book as to forbid it, and we are 
now so fortunate in the crowd of really good novels and most unexcep- 
tional magazines which lie on our tables that we are almost sure that her 



THE MODEL GIRL. 4.} 

choice will be a good one ; for she can find so much more good than bad. 
It is unwise to forbid girls to read novels. They are to-day the best 
reading. Fiction, too, is natural to the youthful mind. It is absurd to 
suppose that Heaven gave us our imagination and rosy dreams for noth- 
ing. They are the drapery of fact, and are intended to soften for us the 
dreary outlines of duty. No girl was ever injured, if she were worth 
saving, by a little novel-reading. Indeed, the most ethical writers of the 
day have learned that, if a fact is worth knowing, it had better be con- 
veyed in the agreeable form of a fiction. What girl would ever learn so 
much of Florentine history in any other way as she learns by reading 
" Romola ? " What better picture of the picturesque past than " The Last 
Days of Pompeii ? " Walter Scott's novels are the veriest mine of English 
and Scotch history ; and we might go on indefinitely. 

As for studies for girls, it is always best to teach them Latin, as a solid 
foundation for the modern languages, if for nothing else ; as much arith- 
metic as they can stand ; and then go on to the higher education and the 
culture which their mature minds demand, if they desire it and are equal 
to it. 

But no mother should either compel or allow her daughter to study to 
the detriment of her health. The moment a girl's body begins to suffer, 
then her mind must be left free from intellectual labour. With some 
women brain-work is impossible. It produces all sorts of diseases, and 
makes them at once a nervous wreck. With other women intellectual 
labour is a necessity. It is like exercise of the limbs. It makes them 
grow strong and rosy. No woman who can study and write, and at the 
same time eat and sleep, preserve her complexion and her temper, need be 
afraid of intellectual labour. But a mother must watch her young stu- 
dent closely, else in the ardour of emulation amid the excitements of 
school she may break down, and her health leave her in an hour. It is 
the inexperienced girl who ruins her health by intellectual labour. 

To many a woman intellectual labour is, however, a necessity. It car- 
ries off nervousness ; it is a delightful retreat from disappointment ; it is 
& perfect armour against ennui. What the convent life is to the devotee, 
what the fashionable arena is to the belle, what the inner science of poli- 
tics is to the European woman of ambition, literary work is to certain in- 
tellectual women. So a mother need not fear to encourage her daughter 
in it, if she sees the strong growing taste, and finds that her health will 
bear it. 

But we fear that certain fashionable schools have ruined the health of 
.many a girl, particularly those where the rooms are situated at the top of 



4(5 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

a four-story building, as they generally are. A poor, panting, weary girl 
mounts these cruel steps to begin the incomprehensibly difficult service of 
a modern school. " Why do you never go out at recess ? " said a teacher 
to one of her pupils. " Because it hurts my heart so much to come up 
the stairs," said the poor girl. " Oh ! but you should take exercise," said 
the teacher ; " Look at Louisa's colour 1 " 

That teacher knew as much of pathology as she did of Hottentot ; and 
the pupil thus advised lies, to-day a hopeless invalid on her bed. 

VI. 
THE MANNERS OF YOUNG MEN. 

BUT, if the amenities of home are thus hopefully to direct our daughters 
in the right way, what will they do for our sons ? 

Of one thing we may be certain, there is no royal road b} T which we can 
make "good young men." The age is adissolute one. The story of temptation 
and indulgence is not new nor finished. The worst of it is that women feed 
and tempt the indulgence of the age. Women permit a lack of respect. 
Even young men who have been well brought up by their mothers become 
careless when associating with girls who assume the manners and customs 
of young men. And when it is added that some women in good society 
hold lax ideas, talk in double entendre, and encourage instead of repres- 
sing license, how can young men but be demoralized ? 

If women show disapproval of coarse ideas and offensive habits, men 
drop those ideas and habits. A woman is treated by men exactly as she 
elects to be treated. There is a growing social blot in our society. It is 
the complacency with which women bear contemptuous treatment from 
men. It is the low order at which they rate themselves, the rowdiness 
of their own conduct, the forgiveness on the part of women of all mascu- 
line sins of omission, that injures men's manners irretrievably. 

Fast men and women, untrained boys and girls, people without culture, 
are doing much to injure modern society. They are injuring the immense 
social force of good manners. Women should remember this part of their 
duty. Men will not be chivalrous or deferential unless women wish them 
to be. 

The amenities of home are everything to a boy. Without them very 
few men can grow to be gentlemen. A man's religion is learned at his 
mother's knee ; and often that powerful recollection is all that he cares 
for on a subject which it is daily becoming more and more of a fashion 



THE MANNERS OF YOUNG MEN. 47 

for men to ignore. His politeness and deference are certainly learned 
there, if anywhere. A mother must remember that all hints which she 
gives her son, as to a graceful and gentlemanly bearing, are so many 
powerful aids to his advancement in the world. A clergyman who did 
not approve of dancing still sent his sou to dancing-school, because, as he 
said, he wished " him to learn to enter a drawing-room without stumbling 
over the piano. 

The education of the body is a very important thing. The joints of 
some poor boys are either too loosely or too tightly hung, and they find it 
difficult to either enter or leave a room gracefully. " Don't you know 
how hard it is for some people to get out of a room after their visit is 
really over ? One would think they had been built in your parlour or . 
study, and were waiting to be launched," says Dr. Holmes. This is so 
true that one almost may suggest that it be a part of education to teach a 
boy how to go away. The" business of salutation " and leave-taking is 
really an important part of education. 

One treat argument for a military exercise is that it teaches the stoop- 
ing to stand up, the lagging to walk, the awkward to be graceful, the 
shambling to step accurately. Lord Macaulay in his old age wished that 
he had had a military training, as he " never had known which foot to 
start with." 

There are some persons born into the world graceful, whose bodies 
always obey the brain. There are far more who have no such physical 
command. To those who have it not, it must be taught. The amenities 
of home should begin with the morning salutation, a graceful bow from 
the boy to his mother, as he comes into breakfast. 

And table manners, what a large part they play in the amenities of 
home ! A mother should teach her boy to avoid both greediness and 
indecision at table. He should be taught to choose what he wants at once 
and to eat quietly, without unnecessary mumbling noise. Unless she 
teaches him such care early, he will hiss at his soup through life. She 
must teach him to hold his fork in his right hand, and to eat with it, and 
to use his napkin properly. If Dr. Johnson had been taught these accom- 
plishments early, it would have been more agreeable for Mrs. Thrale. 
Teach your boy the grace of calmness. Let the etiquette of the well- 
governed, well-ordered table be so familiar to him that he will not be 
flustered if he upsets a wine-glass, or utterly discomposed if a sneeze or a 
choking fit require his sudden retreat behind his napkin, when, after he 
leaves you, he essays to dine abroad. 



43 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

Nothing is better for the practice of the amenities of home than a 
rigorous determination to dress for dinner. . This does not mean that we 
should be expensively or showily dressed, but that every member of the 
family should appear clean and brushed, and with some change of garment. 
A few minutes in the dressing room is not too much of a tax to even the 
busiest man, and he comes down much refreshed to his meal. 

A lady hardly needs any urging on this point ; but, if any one does 
need urging, it is certainly worth mentioning. 

Several years ago a growing family of boys and girls were taken by 
their parents, who had experienced a reverse of fortune, to the neighbour- 
hood of the oil-wells to live. It was about the time they were growing 
up, and their mother was in despair as she thought of the lost opportunities 
of her children. Nothing about them but ignorance. No prospect, no 
schools, no anything. But in the depth of her love she found inspiration. 

Out of the wreck of her fortunes she had saved enough to furnish 
parlour and dining-room prettily, and to buy a few handsome lamps. 
Books were there in plenty, for old books sell for very little ; so she had 
been able to save that important factor of civilization. 

Every evening her lamps were lighted and her dinner spread as if for a 
feast ; and every member of the family was made to come in as neatly 
dressed as if it were a party. The father and mother dressed carefully, 
and the evening was enlivened by music and reading. 

She attended to their education herself, although not fitted for it by 
her own training. She did as well as she could. She taught them to 
bow and to courtesy, to dance, to draw, to paint, to play and sing ; that is, 
she started them in all these accomplishments. In five years, when better 
fortunes brought them to the city again, they were as well-bred as their city 
cousins, and all her friends applauded her spirit. This was done, too, 
with only the assistance of one servant, and sometimes with not even 

that. 

It required enormous courage, persistence, and belief in the amenities of 
home. How many women, under such doleful circumstances, would have 
sunk into sloveliness and despair, and have allowed their nock to run 
wild, like the neighbouring turkeys ! 

There is great hope for country children who are surrounded by a 
certain prosperity and agreeable surroundings. They see more of their 
parents than city children can ; and perhaps the ideal home is always in 
the country. Those small but cultivated Canadian villages, those inland 
cities, those rural neighbourhoods, where nature helps the mother, where 
the natural companionship of animals is possible for the boys, and the 



THE MANNERS OF YOUNG MEN. 49 

pony comes to the door for the girls ; where water is near for boating and 
fishing, and in winter for the dear delights of skating such is the 
beautiful home around which the memory will for ever cling. The ideal 
man can be reared there, one would think that ideal man whom Richter 
delighted to depict, one whose loving heart is the beginning of knowledge. 

We could paint the proper place for the ideal man to be born in, if, alas ! 
for all our theories, he did not occasionally spring out of the slums, ascend 
from the lowest deeps, and confute all our theories by being nature's best 
gem, without ancestry, without home, without help, without culture. 

The education of boys in cities is beset with difficulties; for the 
fashionable education may lead to self-sufficiency and conceit, with a 
disdain of the solid virtues ; or it may lead to effeminacy and foppishness 
the worst faults of a Canadian. These two last faults are, however, 
not fashionable or common faults in our day. There is a sense of superi- 
ority engendered in the " smart young man," so called, which is very 
offensive. All snobs are detestable ; the Canadian snob is preeminently 
detestable. 

A young man of fashion is apt to get him a habitual sneer, which is not 
becoming, and to assume an air of patronage, which is foolish. He has a 
love for discussing evil things, which has a very poor effect on his mind ; 
he has no true ideas of courtesy or good breeding; he is thoroughly selfish, 
and grows more and more debased in his pleasures, as self-indulgence 
becomes the law of his life. 

His outward varnish of manner is so thin that it does not disguise his 
inner worthlessness. It is like that varnish which discloses the true grain 
of the wood. Some people of showy manners are thoroughly ill-bred at 
heart. None of these men have the tradition of fine manners, that old- 
world breeding of which we have spoken. They would be then able to 
cover up their poverty ; but they have not quite enough for that ; and 
they truly believe these misguided youths that a rich father, a fash- 
ionable mother, an air of ineffable conceit, will carry them through the 
world. It is astonishingly true that it goes a great way, but not the 
whole way. 

No youth, bred in a thoroughly virtuous and respectable family, grows 
up to be very much of a snob, let us hope. Alas ! he may become a 
drunkard, a gambler, a failure. And then we come up standing against 
that great cruel stone wall, that unanswered question, " Why have I 
wrought and prayed to no purpose ? " And who shall answer us ? 

It is the one who sins least who is found out, and who gets the most 
punishment. 

D 



50 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

There is a pathetic goodness about some great sinners which they never 
lose. We love the poor fallen one whom we try to save. Never are the 
amenities of home more precious, more sacred, more touching, than when 
they try to help the faltering, stumbling footstep, to hide the disgrace, to 
shelter the guilty, to ignore, if possible, the failing which easily besets the 
prodigal son ; to welcome him back when society has discarded him ; to 
be patient with his pettishness, and to cover his faults with the mantle of 
forgiveness : all these are too tragic, too noble, too sacred for us to dilate 
upon. They are the amenities of heaven. 

Society makes no explanations and asks none, else we might ask why 
some men and women are tolerated, and why others are cast out ? Why 
some young man who had once forgotten himself after dinner is held up to 
scorn, and why another is forgiven even through the worst scandal ? Why 
is injustice ever done ? 

Many a young man, having experienced injustice at the hands of society, 
(roes off and deliberately commits moral suicide. The conduct of society is 
profoundly illogical, and we can not reform it. 

m 

CONSIDERATION FOR EACH OTHER. 

Too great care can not be taken in the family circle of each other's feel- 
ino-s. Never attack your brother's friend. Remember that if we are at all 
individual we can not like the same people, see the same resemblance, or 
enjoy always the same book. Temperaments differ. One feels a draught 
and wishes the window shut while another is stifling with heat. Were we 
among strangers, we should simply bear with the draught or the heat 
without speaking. At home it grows into a quarrel. 

" I am so glad Louisa has gone away, for now I can shut the window," 
said a sister once, who found it so impossible to live with her family that 
on coming into her property she very wisely took a house by herself. 
Perhaps they could not live in the same atmosphere. 

Great care is necessary in remarks about looks. Never tell people that 
they are looking ill. If they are sensitive, as most people are about their 
health, the information that they look ill will make them worse. The 
questions and the searching glance of a kind mother will have to be borne, 
for she is the natural custodian of the health of her family ; but even that 
annoys most people. A due regard for the feelings of her family will teach 
her, in nine cases out of ten, to hide the anxiety she may feel. 



CONSIDERATION* FOE EACH OTHER. 51 

Cheerfulness is very necessary in the family. If a person is really ill, 
we shall find it out soon enough. If he desires sympathy he will come for 
it, but if he is really ailing, and desirous of concealing it, we should respect 
his secret, not strive to worm it from him. Many people are made ill by 
being told that they are ill. An invalid once said that the sunshine had 
all been taken out of his morning walk by the lugubrious looks of a friend, 
who shook his head, and said, " My dear fellow, I must confess that you 
are looking very badly." But there is a class whom Moliere has painted in 
the " Malade Imaginaire," who desire nothing more than to be considered 
ill, who are always looking for sympathy and flattery. 

The amenities of home should surround the real invalid with flowers, 
sunshine, agreeable company, if it can be borne, and variety. It is often 
that the sick-room of some confirmed sufferer is the most cheerful room in 
the house. If there is a pretty new thing in the possession of any mem- 
ber of the family, it finds its way to patient Helen's couch. If there is a 
new book, it goes to her to have its leaves cut ; and if any one has a song 
or story, how quickly it ascends to that person ! "I never knew how happy 
a home I possessed until I broke my leg," said a young man, to whom a 
broken leg was a fearful interruption to business and pleasure. 

Remember always to give a sick person what variety you can com- 
mand. 

Some sufferers from fever require to have the pictures changed on the 
wall. Some invalids, who are prisoners for years in a room, are better for 
a new wall-paper or a new carpet. Nothing can be so grateful as a coun- 
try prospect of wood and water, hill and dale, the sky at morning and at 
evening. The city is a hard place for the chronic invalid who can see noth- 
ing but the opposite row of houses. However, the scene may be varied by 
the presence of birds and flowers ; and a well-bred, favourite dog, parti- 
cularly a big one, is a great help. 

The amenities of the sick-room and the proper management of it are 
subjects which have, however, been so well treated by Florence Nightin- 
gale and others, who have made them a study, that they seem hardlv a 
part of our little treatise. 

The mistress of a house should never reprove her servants at table or 
before her assembled family. It destroys many a meal at home, and drives 
young men to their club, if their mother insists upon using her voice loudly 
in reproving a refractory servant. No doubt she is often tempted ; no 
doubt it is very necessary ; no doubt it requires an angelic patience to 
refrain. But she should refrain ; she should be angelic. Let the man drop 
the plates ; she must be " mistress of herself, though China fall !" Let the 



52 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCDOP^MA. 

maid come in with bare, red arms and a frowsy cap ; the mistress must 
bear it all in silence, nor seem to see it, however dreadful it may be. Then 
let her descend upon the faulty one, and, in" the retirement of the front 
basement, have it out with her. 

Some women have a gift at training servants which is like the talent 
which generals have in handling an army. They can, by their own per- 
sonal magnetism, make a servant refrain from clattering plates. Others 
have no such gift. They are from first to last the slaves of their servants, 
afraid of them, and unable to cope with them. " Oh ! that I could make 
a request which is a command as you do," said one of the inefficient to the 

efficient. 

It is, perhaps, a talent which can not be learned ; certainly, after many 
failures, we do not wonder that the women who can not manage servants 
give up housekeeping, and go to the hotels and boarding-houses. A model 
hostess is said to be one who has a knowledge of the world that nothing 
can impair, a calmness of temper which nothing can disturb, and a kind- 
ness of disposition which can never be exhausted. Now, that is rather an 
unusual character. A hostess should certainly have self-control, and should 
not reprove her servants before company. She should have tact, good- 
breeding, and self-possession. Even then she may not have the talent to 
create god service out of the raw material the clay which Ireland sends 
to her. She can only suffer and be silent. 

We have spoken of the impropriety of attacking our brother's friends. 
If we can not like them, we can refrain from knowing them intimately ; 
but let us always also refrain from speaking ill, or " making fun" of those 
persons who are liked by other members of the family. There are sontQ 
families not the happiest ones where this is done constantly. If Ed- 
mund likes Jack, who is peculiar, William and Susan make all manner of 
" game" of Jack, and he is thus excluded from the house. Edmund hesi- 
tates to invite him, as he knows he will be pained by these ill-natured 
comments. Certain families have a sort of acrid disagreeability, which 
they call wit, which overflows in this way, and which makes home any- 
thing but a happy place. 

Young people are little aware how badly they appear as satirists. They 
do not know enough, as a general thing, to satirize wisely. It takes a 
great and learned person to do that. Young persons should be optimists, 
and should admire rather than condemn. They should learn that culti- 
vated persons rarely have to resort to such weapons as coarse censure and 
crude ridicule. And, even if in the height of good spirits and youthful 
fun, they feel like ridiculing the friend whom their brother has chosen, 



CONSIDERATION FOR EACH OTHER. 53 

let them make the case their own, and try to imagine how they would 
like to hear their own favourite friend abused. 

Long arguments are very unwise, and almost always lead to harsh, un- 
pleasant feeling. If there is a difference of religion in the family, it 
should never be spoken of at table. Many a youthful convert to some 
other creed has been driven from home by the thoughtlessness and un- 
kind remarks of his family. The subject of religion should be rarely or 
never introduced between more than two talkers. The expressions of 
even earnest believers are necessarily so vague that the conversation can 
rarely do any good ; and it is far wiser for the youth to go alone to the 
clergyman whom he selects, or to talk to his father, mother, or chosen 
friend on this most important of all subjects. Still better is it to take 
prayerful counsel of his own heart. Never make it dinner-table talk ; for 
it either becomes flippant and irreverent, or it leads to violent quarrels 
and sometimes to deadly hatreds. 

A difference of political sentiment also is dangerous to the amenities of 
home. Brothers had better not indulge in much discussion in the family 
circle. They can not feel as coolly to each other as ordinary disputants 
that is impossible. They can only differ, and often quarrel. The few who, 
in the familiarity of home, can coolly argue are indeed very few. 

The wise and learned Phillips Brooks says truly, " Familiarity does not 
breed contempt, except of contemptible things or contemptible people." 
This is very true. But we must remember that familiarity does take off 
the outer cuticle, and leave us very defenceless. We are not the same 
strong-handed, steel-visaged personages to our own family that we are to 
the outer world. They know us too well, and we know them too well. 
We are fighting without gloves with our own people. Ths bitterness and 
hurt of a family quarrel is a proverb. 

Never interrupt each other. Let each speaker have his five minutes, 
and say out his say. There are some people so notoriously ill-bred in this 
way that they are nuisances in their own houses. They talk on on on, 
and notice the speech of others not a jot. Others interrupt when one has 
begun a sentence, and have no sort of regard for the fact that even the 
lady of the house has been trying to make a remark for some time. Hesi- 
tating, slow talkers are very apt to be ruled out by fluent ones. Other 
people have a deliberate intention of spoiling a story or an epigram by 
sailing in across the bows of another ; and a still more reprehensible class 
lead up the conversation to a mot or an anecdote which they wish to tell. 
It is a great sin against good-breeding to interrupt a person who is mak- 
ing a remark or about to make one, or to speak before he has quite fin- 



54 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ished. The slow talker usually has something very good to say, and the 
word which he is trying to find is worth waiting for. The fast and flip- 
pant talker sweeps all before him with his weak diaphanous discourse. 
No one is much the wiser for his deluge of words ; the better thought is 
however, washed away, and the slow talker is driven from the field. 

Brilliant talkers have very great temptations in this way. Not only is 
the thought pressing for utterance, and the word dancing on the end of 
the tongue, but the talker also knows that a laugh will follow and his 
mot will be appreciated. There is no such immediate and dear applause 
as that which follows a ready talker, and no wonder that he finds it hard 
to be a good listener. 

However, to be a good listener is a most graceful gift particularly to 
a good talker. It is such an act of self-sacrifice ! Those brilliant "flashes 
of silence " how much they cost the ready-witted talker ! Yet it is to 
him a greater art than to talk well, for it calls on him to repress his own 
seething speech, and to hear somebody say badly what he would say so 
well. 

The good listeners are very popular. They can, even if they have 
nothing to say, still promote conversation ; and a good listener who looks 
amused seems to carry on the conversation. He knows the specialty of 
his friend, and can wind him up and set him going; and if he is an un- 
selfish good listener, he will put in, here and there, the necessary short 
speech which is just what the talker needed. 

Many families have wit and the " give-and-take" of conversation, and 
so supplement each other admirably. Many families of brothers and 
sisters keep the table in a roar by their felicitous remarks, their happy 
quotations, and their delicate and snicy remarks on current events. 
They agree as well in conversation and are as harmonious as when they 
are singing. But there are others where a disregard for the rights of 
conversation spoils the amenities of the dinner-table, and where one 
over-argumentative brother, or one disputatious sister, or a father who 
overrides all his children and talks while they are talking, or a mother 
who has no talent for listening, will destroy the pleasure of the table, 
of the evening fireside talk, and make home a place to be deliberately 

avoided. 

"I wish our home would burn up," said an unhappy boy, who could not 
see any other way out of his domestic misery, and who perhaps intended 
by the light of that corrective fire to run away to parts unknown.

THE FIEST ENGAGEMENT. 

IT is pleasant to turn to one of the brightest chapters of the amenities of 
home and consider that pleasant episode of home life "the first engage- 
ment." 

When it is an arrangement which satisfies prudent papa and mamma, 
this is the most delightful moment of mature life. It makes one young 
again to see the happiness of two young lovers. "All men love a 
lover." The introduction of a new son or daughter that deep feeling of 
rest that our son or daughter is to have the anchorage of marriage these 
are delicious reflections. We forget our trials, our cankering cares, we 
forget that they, too must fight the same hard battle of life which we 
have got nearly through, and we see only the blissful side of the picture. 
If, however, we do not entirely approve, it is a great duty, and one 
which we owe our children, to hide from them any fancied antipathy to 
the chosen one whom we may not wholly love. Given good principles 
and good education, good health and a moderate certainty of a future 
living, and no parent has a right, if his child is sincerely attached, to 
find fault with his or her choice. 

Of course, no mother ever saw any wife quite good enough for her son ; 
no father imagines that the man can be born who is worthy of his daugh- 
ter. Sometimes, without meaning it, this feeling will show itself ; but it 
had much better be kept out of sight, if possible. 

Either a family should take a girl wholly to their hearts, and treat her 
as their own daughter, or they should decidedly disapprove from the first. 
.No mutilated courtesy, no half -handed generosity, no carping criticism is 
just or honourable. That their son loves her, wishes to make her his wife, 
should be a very unanswerable argument for her hearty adoption into the 
family. And with regard to a daughter's husband the same, and even 
greater respect should be shown. The old reproach against mothers-in- 
law now rather relegates itself to old comedy ; it is not believed that they 
are always so detestable as the " Campaigner" in " Pendennis." 

Yet a mother-in-law should let her sons-in-law severely alone, nor dare, 
because she has a very near relationship to him, to interfere in the 
household authority, or to say disagreeable things about the education of 
the children. 

The young girl who enters a large family as the betrothed of one of the 
brothers has a very difficult roll to fill. Unless she is frank and sincere, 



-,G THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

unless she is very engaging, she is apt to be disliked by some of them. 
Perhaps the brother has been a great favorite, and some loving sister is 
jealous of her. Some brother, even, may feel offended at having the 
affections of his most intimate friend stolen away from him ; or the charms 
which have won the lover may not be apparent to the rest of the family. 

Now is the time for good-breeding. Now is the moment for the amen- 
ities. Let the young people remember to treat that young lady with 
peculiar courtesy, for she will never forget their conduct at this period. 
She is to be their sister for all time. If they treat her with respect and 
cordiality, ten to one she will be a good sister. But, if they treat her 
with hatred, suspicion, and dislike, she will be their enemy all her days 
and very little blame to her if she is. It is the cruelty of the red Indian 
to treat a newcomer, introduced under such tender circumstances, with 
anything but kindness. 

Canadian marriages, being for the greater part purely marriages of 
affection, ought all to be happy. That a great majority of them are so we 
firmly believe. The world is, however, not yet paradise, and there is an 
occasional failure. A man, even the most sagacious, does get taken in 
occasionally, and a woman now and then makes a poor choice. Then, 
when father and mother read Edmund's unhappiness in his pale face and 
saddened brow, what are they to do ? 

Nothing. We must bear the sufferings of our children, as we should do 
our own, silently, although they hurt us infinitely more than our own 
have done. And in that new relation we must bring the most perfect 
breeding to our aid, trying to make politeness take the part of love. 

No one feels interested in our failures, in our quarrels, in our diseases, 
or in our disappointments. Wo must " consume our own smoke." No 
one will care to hear that we dislike our daughters-in-law or disprove of 
our sons' wives. The family record should be a sealed book, of which the 
most prudent member keeps the key. We have no chance, in these days 
of newspaper notoriety, to hide from the world what we do ; but we have 
the power to keep our thoughts to ourselves. Our births, deaths, engage- 
ments, marriages, and visits to our friends are all public property, but out- 
opinions are still our own, unless we choose to tell them. 

We can not expect of our daughters-in-law and sons-in-law that they 
will be always patient with us, nor can we ask it. They may find our de- 
mands upon our children exacting. They may find our ways old-fashioned 
and uncongenial ; therefore it is a dangerous experiment to take them 
home to live. Jane may want a fire in her bed-room when her mother-in- 
law considers a fire unnecessary, and damaging to the new carpet. A 



THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT. 57 

young woman, accustomed to the lavish attendance of her own servants, 
may enter a family where the service is limited, and her laces, carelessly 
thrown into the wash, may be brought back by a sad-looking mamma, 
who assures the extravagant daughter-in-law that she keeps "no fine 
washer and ironer." 

These pin-pricks and small worries are what make up life. And in nine 
cases out of ten they so disturb the harmony of daily life that the experi- 
ment of living together fails utterly. Who can say, with any certainty, 
that any two tempers will agree ? Still less half a dozen tempers. 

The first year of married life is a very trying thing. No two young 
people would ever wish to live it over again. They have got to become 
accustomed to each other. They must conquer self. They must begin to 
live dually. It is a hard lesson to learn. " Far from wondering that 
marriage is sometimes unhappy, I wonder always that any two people can 
live together," said an English divine, who has thoroughly understood 
human nature. 

After the illusions of first love must come the sober fact that all life is 
not to be passed in honeymoons ; that we have married mortals, not demi- 
gods or demi-goddesses, and that the future, however much it may be 
illuminated by the light of a sincere affection, is to be a scene of perpetual 
self-sacrifice. 

The happiness of marriage depends upon the very highest and most de- 
licate of reserves ; of the most nattering and careful speech ; of the best 
and most honourable perception; upon a kindness greater than that of a 
mother to her child ; and upon a thousand physical causes. Nobility of 
sentiment is born of love, and is the delightful accompaniment of mai'ried 
love, even in the most low-born brute. Even Bill Sykes had his moments 
of tenderness for the poor wretch who loved him so well, and whom he 
murdered. Women remember these traits, and forget the brutality. The 
devotion of a woman to a drunkard is not remarkable, for, of all men, 
drunkards are sure to have sensibility. But in the every-day marriage, 
between two well-behaved and well-intentioned persons, the danger of los- 
ing that first aroma of devotion is very great, for the cares of daily life are 
very desillusiones (we have no English for that) ; and unless people are 
desirous to keep the flame alight it soon smoulders and goes out. 

So much for the happiest marriages, What, then, of the unhappy ones '. 
Where tempers are wholly incompatible, where tastes differ, where two 
beings find that they have put their necks into a yoke which galls both ; 
when we find that the companion of a lifetime is disagreeable to every 
feeling and sense, that we can not treat each other with justice, because 



38 THE EOME, FARM AXD BUSIXESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

all our worst antipathies are unconsciously aroused by the being whom 
once we loved what then ? 

If left alone, particularly if there are children, people sometimes con- 
tinue to " agree to disagree" very amiably ; but if they are surrounded by 
their relatives never. 

What unhappy wife would not go at once to her father and mother and 
complain ? 

How could they help sympathizing ? And then the cord is broken. 
The moment the domestic question is carried up to a higher court, the 
first judge retires, and will have no more to do with the case. A man 
never forgives this appeal. No wonder a man in such a case hates his 
mother-in-law ; for, if he had been alone on a desert island with his wife, 
they might have fought it out, kissed, and became friends. 

So there is great reason for not taking the young couple home. If they 
quarrel, the partisanship of either side will never be forgiven by the other 
side. Matrimonial quarrels, therefore, to be curable must be confined 
to the high principals. There are, of course, people in this world great 
and good enough to live with others, to " live at home " ; but they are 
very few. 

IX. 

A PEOPESSION FOE DUE SONS. 

CHANCELLOR KENT said, in his wise way, that the citizen who did not 
give his son a profession or a trade was wronging the state. Every one 
must have something to do. The idle man is a dangerous man. It is a 
pity that every boy can not learn a profession and a trade. In the 
troublous times which we have just gone through we have seen how much 
better it was to be a shoemaker than to be a lawyer. The professional 
men nearly starved. 

Madame de Genlis said that she knew seventy trades by any one of 
which she could have earned a living. She taught the sons of Philip 
Egalite" to make shoes, pocket-books, brooms, brushes, hats, coats, and all 
sorts of cabinet-work. She taught them literature, science, and music ; 
had them instructed in watch-making and clock-making, and even in the 
arts of killing and cutting up a sheep. They found many of these resources 
valuable in exile ; and it is strange that it has not occurred to those who 
have boys who are not princes to do the same. A boy could learn to be a 
carpenter while preparing for college, and could study his Latin, Greek, 
and Mathematics with a better brain for the exercise. 



A PROFESSION FOR OUR SOX.S. 59 

It is to be regretted that gentlemen's sons deem certain trades beneatli 
their notice. For all labour is honourable, and all can not succeed as 
lawyers, doctors, clergymen, or merchants. There is great need of the 
handicraft so honourably considered in the middle ages. Every gift 
bestowed upon us by Providence, whether of mind or body, is a talent to 
be grateful for. Arthur can write verses ; Jack can cut down a tree ; Sam 
can reason ; Edmund can do a sum ; Peter can measure and saw boards ; 
Henrv can tame animals and make all nature his tributary; James likes 
to sit and work at some thoughtful, sedentary task ; Horatio is speculative, 
active, courageous he aims to be a broker. Alas ! they all aim at being 
bank clerks or finding employment in some money-making employment. 

In the forming of character, the father and mother should try to make 
headway against this mistake, that to rush headlong into money-making 
is the end of life. A boy should be taught to respect the day of small 
things ; to work honestly for every dollar he gets ; and to let that dollar 
represent something given back for the worth of it. It would be a very 
good thing for all young Canadians if there were a law that they should 
enter no profession or business until they had proved that they could earn 
their living by their hands. 

Casimir P^rier said, when accused of being an aristocrat : " My only 
aristocracy is the superiority which industry, frugality, perseverance, and 
intelligence will insura to every man in a free state of society; and I 
belong to those privileged classes of society to which you may all belong 
in your turn. Our wealth is our own ; we have gained it by the sweat of 
our brows or by the labour of our minds. Our position in society is not 
conferred upon us, but purchased by ourselves with our own intellect, 
application, zeal and knowledge, patience and industry. If you remain 
inferior to us, it is because you have not the talent, the industry, the zeal 
or the sobriety, the patience or the application, necessary to your advance- 
ment. You wish to become rich as some do to become wise, but there is 
no royal road to wealth any more than there is to knowledge." 

These are sentences which should be engraved on the walls of every 
college and school-house. Young men should learn to look to the patient 
labour as their lot in life. The feverish and sudden success of a few, 
wrecks a thousand yearly. 

" There is Charley, who has made his pile," as Canadians say, " in six 
months. Why should I work all my life for what he gains in half a year ? " 
asks visionary and lazy Fred, not counting the thousand failures in busi- 
ness, including failures to be honest. 



60 THE HOMH, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

There is, however, of late a growing taste for agriculture in our country 
which is most hopeful. The earth owes us all a living, and if we will 
" tickle her with a hoe she will laugh with a harvest." 

There is now living in Manitoba a young farmer who went from the 
ranks of a fashionable career right into the fields. Inheriting a farm 
which was worth nothing, unless he worked it himself, he determined to 
study scientific farming at an agricultural college in Guelph, and came 
home armed with useful knowledge and with practical ideas. He had 
learned to be a very good blacksmith, carpenter, saddler, and butcher for 
a farmer should know how to mend his farm-waggon, stitch his harness, 
shoe his horse, and kill his calves according to the economical Old 
Country fashion. 

And he had great good luck, this young farmer, in that he found a wife 
who, like himself, had been reared in " our best society," but who was 
willing to leave all for his sake, and to learn to pickle and preserve, to 
bake and brew, to attend to the dairy, and to get up at five o'clock in the 
morning to give her working husband his breakfast, and he leai-ned that, 

" He who by the plough would thrive, 
Must either hold himself or drive." 

So this jolly farmer is always at it, and drives his team afield himself 
at daybreak. 

The old farmers wonder, as they see this handsome young fellow, 
beautifully dressed, on Sunday, driving his pretty wife to church, that 
he can make more money than they can. His butter is better, and brings 
more a pound ; his wheat is more carefully harvested ; his breed of pigs 
is celebrated ; his chickens are wonderful for the books tell him the 
best to buy. He has learning and science to hitch to his cart, and they 
" homeward from the field " bring him twice the crop that ignorance and 
prejudice draw. 

Above all, he is leading a happy, healthy, and independent life. To be 
sure, his hands are hard and somewhat less white than they were. But 
polo and cricket would have ruined his hand?. His figure is erect, and his 
face is ruddy. He has not lost his talent in the elegant drawing-room, 
but can still dance the German to admiration. He is doing a great work 
and setting a good example ; for he is, as we Canadians say, " making it 
pay." To be sure, he has a great taste for a farmer's life. No one should 
go into it who has not. But what a certainty it is ! Seed-time and 
harvest never fail.

It would seem, while there is so much to be done on this continent with 
her railroads, oil-wells, mines, farms, and wheat-fields, her numerous in- 
dustries and requirements, that no man need be poor. Our sons can find 
something to do, something to turn a hand to. 

The teaching of home should be in this particular age of the world to 
inculcate " plain living and high thinking " in our sons. That is what they 
need to be great and good men, and useful citizens.

PROFESSIONS FOR WOMEN. 

IF the commercial distress which visited this country between the years of 
1873 and 1879 had brought us no other benefit, amidst the vast deal of 
suffering and ruin which occurred to a people who had been living too 
fast, it did this immense good : it taught women that they could work 
and could earn money. It has been no uncommon thing for the wife 
and the sister to support the family during those dreadful years, now 
happily past. 

Men are broken and discouraged when the ordinary business of their 
lives fails them. They have not the versatility of women, they have not 
woman's hope. It probably seemed to many a ruined father that there 
was little hope in the accomplishments of his daughter. She could paint 
a plaque very prettily, perhaps write tolerable poetry ; " but that would 
not pay the butcher." The fact remains that it did pay the butcher. 
One delicate woman during these dreadful years has supported seven 
men seven discouraged, ruined, idle men, and she has done it very well 
too. 

The Decorative Art Society could tell a very good story of woman's 
work, and the sister societies for the aid of women have a noble record on 
their books. Wood-carving, embroidery of a very high class, drawing, 
painting, music-teaching, authorship, engraving on wood and modelling, 
are all now well and profitably done by women. To be reporters for 
newspapers, law reporters in the courts, and even lawyers and doctors are 
also added on. 

The training-schools for nurses have opened a new and beneficent field for 
the cultivated, conscientious girl, who is willing to devote herself to the 
care of the sick. She can now do her work under a certain direction of 
the law and authority, which give it dignity. To be an artist, and a suc- 
cessful one, is a career which is opening more and more to women. To 
paint, to illustrate books, to give fresh ideas to the world with her brush 



(52 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP.EDIA. 

is a noble career for any young woman. It requires talent, patience, 
enormous industry, and some courage, to endure jealous criticism. 

The quarrel in Edinburgh respecting the female doctors, and the oppo- 
sition everywhere to the entrance of women upon men's chosen fields ai e 
fresh enough in the memory of our readers. We need not enter upon 
this subject here. 

Women of heroic force have great difficulty in finding their places in 
the world. They are too active, too full of the unrest of genius, to be 
always happy at home ; the great woman is, when young, like the ugly 
duckling. She does not please her mother or gratify her sisters. She 
does not like to go to parties society bores her. She may not be pretty; if 
she is, she does not care for compliments. If a great philanthropist, like 
Florence Nightingale or Sister Dora, is being developed for the use of the 
world, ten to one this particular bird is too large for the nest, and discom- 
fits all the rest. 

A woman of literary gifts, like Miss Martineau, who is being brought 
up to plain sewing, and who has to come to her real work through much 
family strife and contention, is no doubt very disagreeable and troublesome 
to those who have no strivings, no immortal fire to take care of. Such 
women generally leave a record of much suffering, of early injustice, of 
the unkindness of relatives, behind them, and claim that,, had they been 
treated better and better understood, they would have been finer charac- 
ters and more useful to their day and generation. 

There is no doubt of the fact that a narrow-minded mother has often 
ruined the development and the usefulness of her gifted daughter. She 
least of all comprehends the child who, though her very own, has all the 
qualities of another race. It once gave a very good mother the most 
acute pain because her daughter threw an apple-paring into the fire 
exactly like her aunt Clarissa. " What do you want to do that for, ex- 
actly like your aunt ?" was the angry question. Aunt Clarissa was the 
father's sister, and particularly disagreeable to the mother. It was a 
perfectly honest and irresistible disgust. We can imagine how much 
more powerful it would be if carried beyond apple-parings. 

A young artist in Paris, who made a good living for her mother and 
sister, declared with tears that she had never been forgiven by either of 
them for deserting her sewing-machine for the palette, and it was evident 
that she was not clear in her own mind as to whether she had not dis- 
graced herself. 

These are instances of narrowness happily conspicuous, and we hope 
few. But should not parents deeply consider them, and ask themselves 



PROFESSIONS FOR WOMEX. gg 

if they have a right to interfere with the chosen vocation of a daughter, 
even if it does seem to them to be eccentric ? We know a mother who 
aimed at social distinction and a rich marriage for her daughter, who was 
so disgusted with her for choosing to become a doctor that she fell ill and 
would not allow her to care for or nurse her. 

" Perhaps you had better try homoeopathy, and take the cause of your 
disease as your cure," said her family physician. 

" No, never. I would rather die than be cured by Helen," said the 
offended mother. 

She lived to forgive Helen, who now supports her, and she is in excel- 
lent health and spirits at sixty-five. Probably Helen therefore knew best 
what was good for her. 

But it is an unlucky thing for the amenities of home when the daughters 
are so strongly disposed to leave the ordinary walks of every-day feminine 
duty. The happiest women are those who can lead the ordinary life, be 
amused by society, dress, and conventionalities, and who can be early 
married to the man of their choice, and become in their turn domestic 
women, good wives and mothers. There is no other work, no matter how 
distinguished, which equals this. But, if this life does not come to a wo- 
man, and certainly it does not to a very large number, there can be no 
doubt of the propriety of a woman's finding her own sphere, her own work 
iind her happiest and most energetic usefulness. 

Anything can be forgiven of a woman except a career of vice or vanity, 
or the wretched numbness of inaction. No woman should insult her Maker 
by supposing that He made a mistake in making her. A morbid or a 
useless woman was not contemplated in the great plan of the universe. 
She has always a sphere. If home is unhappy beyond her power of endur- 
ance, let her

become the manager of a business, do anything but sit down and mope, 
and wait for something to turn up. Many a pair of unhappy old maids 
are now dragging out a miserable existence in a second-class boarding- 
house, turning their poor little bits of finery, who might, if they had been 
brave in their youth, have won a large repertoire of thought and a com- 
fortable competency. But they preferred to keep alive one little corner of

hands which should not have been ashamed to work, hands which would 

have been whiter for honest efforts. 

The prejudice against literary women has so much disappeared that it 
requires no word of encouragement now to women to try literature as a 
means of getting a living. Indeed, so many more try writing than have 
the gift for it that it would perhaps be wise to recommend a great many 
to try anything rather than that. 

To write well must be in the first place a gift ; all have it not. To be 
sure, it also requires will, persistency, and the most enormous industry. 
No one ever wrote well who had not gone through many an hour of pain, 
disgust at the work, and a crucial test of the hard labour that is to bring 
from the brain its purest gold. But even the industrious can not always 
write ; and if a woman does not write well she generally writes very 
poorlv. She can not do machine work as well as a man can. Therefore, 
if she have no inspiration, she had better throw down the pen. 

Women, by reason of their health, are sometimes debarred from taking 
up any very exacting out-of-door work. This was, in the opinion of an 
Edinburgh surgeon (the particular enemy of Miss Jex Blake), an unan- 
swerable argument against their becoming physicians and surgeons. The 
fact remains that they have become both. Therefore, we can never say 
what a woman can not do. 

We could hardly train our daughters to be car conductors, soldiers, or 
police-officers, the three trades which are always thrown in the face of 
woman's suffragists ; but it remains to be seen why they should not play 
in orchestras, become jewellers and watch-makers, wood-carvers, and inter- 
nal decorators, that branch of household art now so fashionable and so 
profitable. 

One energetic woman in France has made a large fortune by raising 
hens and chickens. Another in the west is a good practical farmer, taking 
care of ten thousand acres, and making money surely and rapidly. It will 
repay all women to inquire what were Madame de Genlis' seventy trades, 
and which one, or two, she will learn. 

There is another reason for learning a trade or an accomplishment, and 
that is for the pleasure which it gives to an otherwise idle lady. Many a 
woman, after her children are married, finds herself with days to get rid 
of which have no possible pleasure in them, Her occupation is gone, and 
she needs the help of something to carry off weary, unprofitable hours. She 
generally, in these days, takes to painting plaques, and plates, fans and 
reticules which is very good as long as it lasts. It does not last very long 
to a woman of active mind. She needs to throw in charities and outside

action, to organize new schemes, and to help along church and school. To 
unmask abuses, to do that work in a great city which otherwise goes 
undone ; that is part of a good woman's work, which may amply repay an 
hour's thought. 

The scheme for Protestant sisterhoods, which is looked upon with alarm 
by many most thoughtful people, as opening a door for that purposeless 
conventual seclusion and life of imprisonment and ritualistic mummery in 
which we Protestants do not believe, has grown out of the necessity which 
unmarried women feel for a vocation. 

There can be no harm in the institution of Protestant sisterhoods so 
long as the sisters take no positive vow. It will not hurt women to enter 
a religious house, work under a lady superior in instructing the ignorant, 
raising the fallen, helping the poor, so long as they do not lock the door 
on themselves and give the key into another hand. There is no one who 
can be trusted with the custody of our liberty but ourselves. A clergy- 
man may be a very good man, but he is still simply a fallible man ; and 
he may mistake very much his duty when a Protestant sister tells him 
that she desires to leave her work if he tells her that she can not. She 
may know very much better than he. It is all very well to bind one's 
self to a good work for a year or two years, that there may be consistency 
in the enterprise ; but a longer or a final term is not consistent with that 
freedom which God has given us. 

XI. 

THE INFLUENCE OF AGED PEOPLE. 

THERE is no genre picture so ornamental to the fireside as an old lady with 
grey curls. Home should alway contain a grandmother, old aunt, or some 
relative who has seen the world, lived her life, and who is now waiting 
gently for the news which came to Christiana in the " Pilgrim's Progress," 
meantime taking a pleasant interest in the little tragedy or comedy of 
every-day life, and being the particular providence of the younger chil- 
dren. Such an old lady is as agreeable as she is ornamental. So important 
is the respectability of a virtuous ancestor to the nouveau riche, that 
Dickens says, in his immortal way, of the Veneerings, " that, if they had 
wanted a grandfather, they would have ordered him fresh from Fortnum's 
and Mason's. He would have come round with the pickles." 

A grandfather is a very useful article, whether to quote from or to enjoy 
daily. An agreeable old man is the most delightful acquisition to any 

E

society. It is, perhaps, one reason why the English dinner-table is so pre- 
eminently agreeable, that old men keep themselves so very fresh, healthy, 
youthful in feeling, while they are, of course, full of the results of experi- 
ence. A man in England at sixty-five has not allowed himself to grow 
careless of dress or appearance. He is not sunk in the apathy or preoccu- 
pation of old age, even at eighty. To keep himself au courant with the 
excitements of the hour has been his rule through life. We who live must 
live every hour. We must cultivate those who are younger as a weary tra- 
veller stoops to drink of the fresh spring which bubbles up at his feet. It 
will not do for us to seal up in a bottle the wine which was good when 
we were young, and drink only that ; we must go ever to the fresher 
vineyards. It is not given to us all to remember a kindly grandfather ; 
but, to those who can do so, it is the most agreeable perhaps of childhood's 
memories. 

The lovely old lady is a great treasure in a household, has often agree- 
able accomplishments in the way of needlework and knitting, has a per- 
fect store of excellent recipes for cakes and custards, and knows the most 
delightful old-fashioned games of cards. She has manners, too, learned in 
a better school than ours. She is stately, courteous, a little formal. She 
makes a beautiful courtesy. She tells us how she was taught to do " laid 
work," to sew furs, to conserve currants, to sit up and not touch the back 
of her chair. Her figure shows that a good spine is the result of her early 
training. She is the one who is never tired of the society of the growing 
<nrls, and who has at twilight the prettiest stories of the time when she 
was a young lady and Grandpapa came a-courting. It seems, seen through 
the tender light of tradition, as if those were more romantic days than 
ours. No doubt she has treasures of old lace and brocade, which come out 
for dolls' dresses and pincushions. She is very apt at Christmas-tide to 
produce unexpected treasures. To comfort and encourage the faltering, 
fainting mother when the new cares of maternity seem almost beyond her 
strength, who so invaluable as the old lady ? To soothe the boys and girls 
when the business of life has removed for a moment their immediate 
guardian, who so nice as Grandmamma ? 

For young fathers and mothers have their own lives to live. They must 
be excused if they wish to go to dinners, and parties, and to Europe with- 
out the children. Indeed, while the husband is making the fortune, and 
the wife is keeping house, and living out the business of youth, it some- 
times seems a pity that the bearing of children should be thrown in. An 
English economist gravely proposed that children should be born to the 
old, who have gotten through with wishing to live, and who would be very

much amused with the business of the nursing, all other business havino- 
ceased to amuse them. 

Young people have a deal else to amuse them, no doubt, and a family 
of children often seems a great bother to them ; but the fact remains that 
they are ordained to cope with this particular business, and they alone 
have the strength to bear with the ceaseless activity of childhood. Chil- 
dren after a time fatigue the old. 

The other side of the picture is this, also. Old people are not always 
y agreeable, particularly old men, in a household.V Grandpapa may be very 
gouty and very cross, very unreasonable in his requirements, and uncertain 
as to his hours. He may rap an unwary urchin over the head before he 
knows it with his cane, and come down severely on the subject of the 
girls' new dresses. If Grandpapa holds the purse-strings, he is a terrible 
power. It is not often, however, that rich old men are disobeyed or neo-- 
lected. Human selfishness is too wary. 

Old men generally are not so agreeable in a household as old women. 
They are caged lions, if disease has crippled them ; they torment them- 
selves and those with whom they live ; they feel the deprivation of that 
power and that importance which once made up their lives. They have 
never, perhaps, cultivated the domestic virtues. 

So much the better for the amenities of home if the household bear all 
this with patience, and all try to remember all that Grandpapa did for 
them when he was young and strong. No matter what are the disagree- 
able traits of the old, we must bear them upon our young and stron^ backs. 
It is one of the privileges of home that we can do this duty, and help old 
age to bear its sorrows. How manifold are those evils the loss of si-ht, 
the loss of hearing, the aggravation of the nerves, the rheumatic pains ! 

Dr. Johnson, in the " Rambler," says : "A Greek epigrammatist, intend- 
ing to show the miseries that attend the last stage of man, imprecates upon 
those who are so foolish as to wish for long life the calamity of continuing 
to grow from oentury to century. He thought that no adventitious or 
foreign pain was requisite, that decrepitude itself was an epitome of what- 
ever is dreadful, and nothing could be added to the curse of age but that 
it should be extended beyond its proper limits." 

" It -would be well," says Colton, " if old age diminished our perceptibil- 
ities to pain in the same proportion that it does our sensibilitees to plea- 
sure, and, if life has been termed a feast, those favoured few are the most 
fortunate guests who are not compelled to sit at the table when they can 
no longer partake of the banquet. But the misfortune is that body and 
mind, like man and wife, do not always agree to die together. It is bad 



68 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

when the mind survives the body, and worse still when the body survives 
the mind : but when both these survive our spirits, our hopes, and our 
health, this is worst of all." 

Many old people who come upon their middle-aged children for support 
and consolation have reached the latter condition. And no doubt they are 
a very heavy burden. Many an ill-tempered old person has ruined the 
life of a devoted son or daughter. But the duty remains. It is one which 
must not be shirked, even if it descends to a grand-daughter. Little Nell 
did her duty, and only her duty. 

It has remained for Dickens to depict, as only he can, the burden of un- 
just and wicked parents upon virtuous children, Indeed, he has been 
blamed for grinding up his own father in paint, and therefrom construct- 
ing the characters of Turveydrop, Mr. Dorrit, and Mr. Micawber. One can 
but feel regret that a youth such as Dickens passed had eradicated much 
that was delicate and desirable in the way of reticence. Yet the world 
needed the lesson. There are depths in the heart of man which can only 
be reached by such revelations : and we can but hope that some thoroughly 
selfish and unworthy parents have read and profited by these lessons ; that 
a Turveydrop may have seen himself, and have ceased to live on his chil- 
dren ; that a Dorrit may have been ashamed of his pretence and turgidity ; 
a Micawber, more lovable than the others, have been aroused from his 
worthless dreams ! 

Severity and censoriousness in the old alienate youthful affections, and 
the old should constantly bear in mind that, if they would keep the affec- 
tions of their descendants, they must cultivate amiability. As Dr. Johii- 
'" son says, to again quote his wise words : " There are many who live mere- 
ly to hinder happiness, and whose descendants can only tell of long life, 
that it produces suspicion, malignity, peevishness, and persecution ; and 
yet even these tyrants can talk of the ingratitude of the age, curse their 
heirs for impatience, and wonder that young men can not take pleasure in 
their father's company. 

" He that would pass the latter part of his life with honour and decency 
most, when he is youHg, consider that he shall one day be old, and remem 
ber when he is old, that he has once been young. In youth he must lay 
up knowledge for his support when his powers of acting shall forsake 
him ; and in age forbear to animadvert with vigour on faults which ex- 
perience only can correct." 

Those who are endeavouring to make home happy, and who are baffled 
by the peevishness of an old person, must try to strengthen themselves in 
the good work by every argument in favour of old age, making every ex-

cuse for it ; and, if all other arguments fail, must constantly say to them- 
selves, " I shall one day be old ; let me treat my aged relatives as I hope 
that my children may treat me." 

Home should indeed be a " blessed provision " for the aged. Whether 
they are those healthy, agreeable old people who have laughed at time, 
those whose unique privilege it has been to stand erect under the burden 
of eighty years, or those whom time and circumstance have crippled and 
cast down, home is their place, and it should not be in our hearts to con- 
sider them as a burden. 

XII. 
THE CAPABILITIES OF HOME EDUCATION. 

" THE methods of education should be such as to guide and balance the 
tendencies of human nature, rather than to subvert them." 

Mothers must all agree that the best part of education is that which 
children give themselves in a happy, healthy, not too formal home. The 
education of a child is principally derived from its own observation of the 
actions, the words, the looks, of those among whom it lives. The observa- 
tion of children is keen and incessant. They are always drawing their 
own conclusions. These observations and conclusions have a powerful 
influence in forming the character of youth. What you tell them they 
are very apt to receive with suspicion. Seeing is believing. 

" How do you know that that is ^1 .' " said a rather irreverent pupil to 
his teacher. 

" Why, because I was taught so ! " 

" Well, who taught you ? " returned Johnny. 

" My teacher, a very good old man," said the poor schoolmistress, point- 
ing to the first letter of the alphabet. 

" Well, now, how do you know but that old man lied ? " returned the 
imperturbable John. 

The teacher was nonplussed. At last she thought of a happy way out 
of her difficulties. 

" You watch the other boys, Johnny, and see if they think it is A ; if 
they do not, you may believe that it is B." 

The great letter proved to be A to John's satisfaction, after he had 
taught fdm.--flf that it was likely to be it. A matter of self- acquisition, 
treasured up and reasoned upon, with collateral testimony brought to bear, 
which grew stronger as Johnny advanced in literature, made A to Johnny 
a fact. It was no fiction of learning which his natural enemies were fore- 



70 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ing upon him ; but, his native shrewdness having found them out to be 
correct on this one important fact, he believed them in future, and accept- 
ed B and C as parts of a system, occult and difficult to remember, but 
still as facts. 

We must remember, when in the first youthful ardour of our systems 
and schemes of education, that costly apparatus and splendid cabinets have 
no power to make scholars. The little scholar says to his teacher, " Will 
you tell me what time it is ? " as he looks at the clock. " No," she should 
say ; " I want you to tell me what time it is." 

'in a half hour the most slow and unimpressionable boy can learn to tell 
time, and so on. His books and teachers must be his helpers, but the work 
must be his. As Daniel Webster said : " A man is not educated until he 
has the ability to summon in an emergency his mental powers in vigorous 
exercise to effect its proposed object. It is not the man who has read the 
most or seen the most who can do this ; such a one is in danger of being 
borne down like a beast of burden by an overloaded mass of other men's 
thoughts. Nor is it the man who can boast merely of native vigour and 
capacity. The greatest of all warriors who went to the siege of Troy had 
not the preeminence because Nature had given him strength, and he car- 
ried the longest bow, but because self-discipline had taught him how to 
bend it."- 

It is this power of raising a boy's mind to the ability to work for itself 
which is the highest achievement of education, and mothers are sometimes 
inspired with it. 

And, as curiosity is the first feeler which the youthful brain puts out, 
the mother should be very patient in answering questions. This is, per- 
haps, the hardest trial which a mother has to meet. To answer the ques- 
tions of a tireless crowd of children is enough to drive a nervous woman 
insane. But, as long as her strength lasts, she must try to do it, and as 
long as she knows what to say. When they begin with those unanswer- 
able questions upon theology which they always ask, and which she can 
no more answer than they can, then she must stop. 

" Mamma ! why did God make the devil if he didn't want any evil in 
the world ? " 

" I do not know, my dear ; you must ask your father," has been said to 
be the most powerful lecture upon woman's cunning and man's limitations 
which was ever preached. 

Curiosity being once excited, the field is ploughed, and the seeds of 
learning can be dropped in. Unhappily for the poor boy, he has got to 
learn many things by rote the multiplication table, the spelling-book, 



THE CAPABILITIES OF HOME EDUCATION. 71 

the Latin grammar ; he must be taught that dreary grind which we call 
formula, in order that he may have a mental tape-measure to go by 
hereafter. 

But just as little should be taught by rote as possible, especially what 
the child does not understand. It cripples the mind, while it helps the 
memory. Original thinkers have never been able to learn much by rote. 

We must remember that education is like the grafting process, and there 
must be some affinity beween the stock and the graft if we wish to get 
good fruit. Even if it were desirable, it is very poor work to try to oblit- 
erate natural tendencies, and make the tree grow artificially. We want, 
while we are grafting our young tree, and cutting off the unnecessary 
shoots, to preserve the fine original flavour of the fruit which God gave it, 
which we did not make, and can only help it to mature and ripen ; for- 
tunate if, in our blundering ignorance, we do not injure rather than im- 
prove it. 

We should teach our children to communicate to us their thoughts and 
inclinations with perfect freedom, so that we can guess what their minds 
are leading to. We can thus help them on their favourite road toward 
any art or science to which their talents tend. We have to contend mor- 
ally with the habitual reticence of childhood ; but intellectually, if not 
repressed or frightened, childhood is frank. 

In teaching anything, as little as possible should be taught a child at 
once. No wise mother gives her child a half-dozen dishes to eat at once. 
She respects his stomach. Why not have the same regard for his brain ? 

In this, we are making the mother the teacher. We are speaking of 
the capabilities of home, which is to be opposed to the very injudicious 
tendencies of the average school, an institution in which most mothers 
who look back upon an extended experience usually unite in decrying. 
Even Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, who was the model school-master, says, "A 
great school is very trying. It never can present images of rest and 
peace ; and when the spring and activity of youth are altogether unsanc- 
tified by anything pure and elevated in its desires, it becomes a spectacle 
that is dizzying, and almost more morally distressing than the shouts and 
gambols of a set of lunatics." 

The trouble with many of our schools is simply this : they are money- 
making institutions only. Hard teachers, bad air, and the forcing system, 
so that the master may have a showy examination, that is all. Oh ! what 
distorted spines, what fevers, what curious diseases, what wrath, what 
confusion, what despair, have not been born in a fashionable school ! It 
is dreadful to think of the tasks which are imposed. And yet it is not 



72 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

within the capabilities of home to do without a school-training, especially 
for boys. They must go to encounter the hard lessons which are to 
prepare them for life. To learn their kind, to get rid of morbidity, school 
is necessary. 

It is fortunately within the capabilities of home to smooth the path of 
the suffering boy or girl who has to know everything. 

" The school-boy knows the exact distance to an inch from the moon to 
Uranus," says Dickens, who had the liveliest horror of a school, and the 
most active sympathy with school boys. " The school-boy knows every 
conceivable quotation from the Greek and Latin authors. The school- 
boy is up at present, and has been these two years, in the remotest corners 
of the maps of Russia and Turkey, previously to which display of his 
geographical accomplishments he had been on the most intimate terms 
with the whole of the gold regions of Australia. If there were a run 
against the monetary system of this great country to-morrow, we should 
find this prodigy of a school-boy down upon us with the deepest mystery 
of banking and the currency." 

It is this cramming system, this illy digested and cruel quantity, which 
is killing our boys, disgusting them with the word learning, and which 
turns our colleges into lounging-places for the lazy, where clubs are formed, 
and where a "dig" is looked down upon as a low fellow. It is against 
this false system that all the powers of home should be arrayed. 

We fear that the teachers of girls are very seldom guided by any defi- 
nite principles in educating the feelings and the intellect of their pupils. 
The power of self-control is not sufficiently dwelt upon ; the power of re 
flection, of looking inward, of gaining self-knowledge in its true sense, is 
eft to be the growth of chance. The purely intellectual faculty, the 
power of comprehension, instead of being constantly employed upon 
objects within its grasp, is neglected in order to overload the memory. 
Women should be taught to think, to be logical, to bring themselves to 
reason where they only feel ; to study abstract justice (a quality a woman 
seldom if ever possesses) : it is a necessity. 

Much may be said of the capabilities of home education for a girl with 
governesses. We are not rich in that staple English article ; but there are 
good governesses to be found. 

It is a question, however, whether or no we do not deprive a girl of 
much that is afterwards agreeable in her life in not sending her to school. 
She ought to know other girls and to measure herself with them. Youth- 
ful friendships are the strongest ; and we would not like to relinquish 
that bond. How much more of evil she will learn than of good in a 



MAKING HOME ATTRACTIVE. 7;i 

mixed boarding-school remains an unanswered question. Most people 
after careful inquiry are brave enough to send their daughters to a board- 
ing-school ; and there are some schools which are so admirable that they 
can certainly do our daughters more good than harm. 

The public school is no doubt a better place for the acquirement of 
knowledge than the private school. It is a procrustean bed, but it cer- 
tainly produces good scholars. 

xni. 

MAKING HOME ATTRACTIVE. 

THERE are few women who do not try for this, and few women who, trying, 
do not succeed. The poorest woman can now with very little money make 
a pretty room, and save it from the lonely, sordid, or conventional look of 
a room in a boarding-house. She can avoid horsehair sofas and violent 
carpets, charges frescoes, and vulgar prints on the walls. Good engravings, 
a little cretonne, aome knick-knacks made by herself, a few grasses, a grow- 
ing plant, and an open fire are all that are needed to make a room pleasant 
and refined. 

What a pity it is that in a country covered with wood, a wood fire 
should be an expensive luxury, for there is nothing like it to make home 
attractive ! It burns up many a quarrel and morbid speculation, right* 
many a wrong, and promotes peace. No picture is so utterly cheerful as 
that of the family gathering round it as evening falls. No conversations 
are so fresh and witty as those which go up with the sparks. No compa- 
nion is so lively and invigorating to the invalid, the recluse, the mourner, 
or the aged as a wood fire. It is the most healthful of all ventilators, the 
most picturesque picture, the most enlivening suggestion of energy and 
thrift. It is the most fragrant bouquet, the most eloquent of orators. It 
is a story-teller to the fanciful, and a juggler to those who love the mar- 
vellous. What fairy tales does it not tell with its sparks on the back of 
the chimney ! What combinations of initials it presents to the lovers, who 
read " A" and " E " mysteriously combined in a true-lovers' knot, written 
in fire, as is their love ! What strange shapes the logs take to those who 
intrust their fortune-telling to its mystic revelation ! What dreamy fancies- 
go up in the smoke. 

Nothing is so healthful as a wood fire in a sick-room. Certain physicians 
gay that it will cure some diseases. In cities, however, we have nothing to 
take its place but cannel coal, which make a bright and lively fire, and 



74 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

which is the next best thing to the wood fire, and which should be used in 
every living-room. 

What a fine old-fashioned distinction that is, by the way, the living- 
room ! As if the rooms kept for company were dead rooms, rooms full of 
ghostly furniture, kept for show, and of cold and fearful aspect. In a true 
home every room should be a living-room. We should live all over our 
houses, have nothing too fine to use. Of course the nursery should hold 
the young destroyers, until they know what not to break, if that know- 
ledge ever comes. But, to a trooping set of happy boys and girls, the house 
should be open and free. 

Each person will find his sanctum, of course, and every one should, if 
possible, have a room to himself. There should be some place for those 
who must work to retire to, where solitude would be possible. But the 
dining-room, the library, and the parlour should be cheerful and orderly, 
and always lighted up by some constant and familiar presence. Some- 
body should be there to welcome the wanderers, to greet the stranger, and 
to gather the children together as a hen gathers her chickens under her 
wings. This person is generally the mother, who is the core of home. 

Jt is this hour of reunion, this happy hour by the wood fire, which pays 
her for all her work, all her trials. If she can see her group passing into 
a respectable manhood and womanhood, if she can see happy, honest, 
hopeful, industrious sons, and blooming, modest daughters, she compounds 
with the past for all its pains, its desperate despair, its hard usage of her- 
self. She does not mind her altered face and figure, the gray hair, the 
age which has come too soon. Her work is done, she has made a happy 
home, and its fruit is before her intact. 

Even if she has failed in her loftiest ambitions, even if she has not made 
heroes of her sons, or eminent women of her daughters, let her be grateful 
that she has done no worse. Let her be grateful for the strength which 
has not failed her at the death-bed of her lost ones, that has not given out 
in the darkest hour, that has sustained the falling, animated the discour- 
aged, and kept that sacred flame alight on the hearthstone which will in 
future years be the altar fire in all who remember her. The true home is 
that where there have been sorrow, self-sacrifice, struggle, renunciation, 
courage, heroism ; and happy are they who have through all discourage- 
ments preserved it. 

-4 The valuable influence of sisters in a family of brothers, can not be too 
strongly emphasized in the subject of the amenities of home. Not only do 
they or should they give a feminine refinement to the house, but the very 
duty which they have the right to require of their brothers, those acts of 



MAKIXG HOME ATTRACTIVE. 7.5 

personal attention and gallantry, the accompanying of them to parties and 
to theatres, and the instinct which makes them their sisters' most chival- 
rous defenders, all go far toward making them gentlemen. It is the sister's 
fault if she is not a refining and a corrective influence in her brother's life. 
In this day of mannish young girls it is to be feared that she is not alto- 
gether as universally so as she should be ; but a sister should strive for 
that position. She should strive for her brother's affection and confidence 
and should endeavour to enlighten them upon the character of girls whom 
they may marry. She knows them, and men can not know the characters 
of women as another woman can. 

The refining influence of young girls upon young boys has led many 
thoughtful persons to advise the establishment of mixed schools, where 
the sexes may meet, as in the home circle, for mutual improvement. It 
certainly improves the boys. They are more anxious to be clean, to 
brush their hair, to have better manners at table. Whether it is so good 
for the girls remain to be proved. It is doubtful if the young people 
should bs exposed to the early temptation of falling in love while the 
severe business of study is being required of them. 

To make home happy when there is even one nagging, hateful, unjust 
person in it, one who is full of small unavailabilities, one who will take 
the blower down from the fire when another has put it up, who will 
angrily shut a window when another has thrown it open, who will stud}' 
to put out lights which have just been carefully lighted to enable a person 
to read, and so on the list is a long one is a difficult matter. Injustice 
and petty tyranny go a long way toward ruiniiigthe character of children, 
and those who grow up in a house where the father has always been un- 
just to their mother, those who see him doing these little things daily to 
make her uncomfortable, have little chance of becoming cheerful and good 
members of society. 

" That remembered bitterness has coloured my whole view of human 
nature," said a man of fifty years of age, as he spoke of the treatment 
which his mother had received at the hands of his father, from the dress- 
ing of a salad up to the education of the children. But women can bear it, 
and should do it for the children's sake. The idea of home is worth it all 
and she who does bear it is one of God's saints and martyrs. 

So with an unworthy mother. The father and the children should 
combine to cover up this most radical and thorough disintegration of home. 
It is touching to see some young girl rising like a delicate flower, which 
seeks to become a tree, that it may give shelter and food and rest to those 
who cluster beneath its shade. A woman in making a good home shelters 



7G THE HOMK, FALM AND BUSINKSS CYCLOPEDIA. 

not only her own, but the houseless children of less worth}' women. How 
many friendless boys there are in the world who come gratefully to such 
shelter ! How many a sick and weary pilgrim, deserted by those whom 
he has trusted, floats into this safe harbour ! Every member of a happy 
household goes out into the world to find these waifs, whom he brings 
home to the family table and the family protection. It is one of the best 
privileges of home to the benevolent, this power of doing all the good 
which thus accidentally comes in one's way. 

Many a young man living forlornly in lodgings has been saved from 
fatal illness and despair by the kind interposition of some family who 
have found him out and have taken him home, who have nursed him in 
illness, encouraging him to hope and to recover. Many a house becomes 
a " home for the friendless" in this way. Certainly a noble hospitality. 

It is not the richest house which is the most hospitable ; so no one 
need be discouraged in the attempt to be hospitable by want of money. 
It is charming to one's self-love to have a well-furnished house, a French 
cook, and a beautiful dinner service, a butler and fine wines, and to ask 
one's friends to come to excellent dinners, to see how well we live. But 
those of lesser means have the power to give, and to exercise the true 
spirit of the most sincere hospitality without these adjuncts. 

Home, being a sti'ong background, should not be carelessly used to give 
a factitious respectability to those who are unworthy. Women of large 
hearts sometimes do this wrong to the world. In their earnest desire to 
help the unfortunate, they take in a person of uncertain character, and 
launch upon the world an adventuress or a rascal. " He or she has Mrs. 
So and So's indorsement ; he has lived in her family." This has started 
many a specious vagabond in society. This looseness of goodness has 
done much harm. Of course, we can not help being sometimes deceived 
ourselves, but we can help being culpably careless. 

Much of this kind of patronage undoubtedly springs from a love of 
approbation, which is a poor motive. People like to patronize and to be 
looked up to ; they like to hear themselves spoken of as being generous, 
noble, and hospitable. The flattery of those whom we have rescued from 
a doubtful position is sweet, in vast contrast with the utter want of 
gratitude which often comes to us from those who owe us everything. 
We do not always receive the praises due to us for the work we have 
really done, and the heart of woman craves praise. Glad is she to get it, 
even from the unworthy. 

But here the hospitable heart should stop and ask herself these ques- 
tions : " Is my motive in taking in this woman purely generous and 



MAKING HOME ATfRAGTIVK. >fl 

sincerely kind ? Do I know her well enough to make her a member of 
my family ? Have I a right to give her the prestige of my name and 
family, which she will receive if known as my protegee ?" 

We have dwelt but little on the duty which every head of a familv 
owes to herself, her family, and the outside world, in allowing no scandal 
to be talked at her table or by her fireside. 

The character of some houses in this respect is fearful. " Ye who enter 
in, leave all hope behind "; for your flesh will be pecked from your very 
bones. Some families have a keen wit, impinging tempers, sharp speech, 
and an omnivorous appetite for unhandsome traditions of their neighbours. 
They batten on human character, and to dilate upon the many stories 
which float around concerning everybody is their best amusement. A 
" man vaise la ngue" is a fearful -gift. It makes a woman powerful but 
hated. " She is a great gossip, she is a talker," is the worst of all re- 
putations in a neighbourhood. 

It is difficult for the mother of bright and witty young people to keep 
them from the over-exercise of their tongues. They catch the grotesque 
and funny side of things intuitively. They are not too particular as to 
what they say of their companions ; and there is nobody who can not be 
ridiculed. Therefore they grow into scandal-mongers innocently at first, 
and regard the amusement of making people laugh at their friends as an 
element of being agreeable. This grows into bitterness, and the attri- 
buting of ignoble motives as they grow older, on the part of those who 
find life disappointing, and whose experience does not tend to soften them. 
Therefore a rule, formed early in life, to not speak ill of anybody, no 
matter what the provocation, would be most useful and beneficent. 

Children and young people should be warned against the dangers of 
mimicry. It is an amusing but a dangerous gift ; and he who cultivates 
it will sooner or later get into difficulty. 

" Whatever tends to form manners or to finish men has great value. 
Kvny one who has tasted the delights of friendship will respect every 
social guard which our manners can establish tending to secure us from 
the intrusion of frivolous and distasteful people. The jealousy of every 
class to guard itself is a testimony to the reality they have found in life. 
When a man once knows that he has done justice to himself, let him dis- 
miss all terrors of aristocracy as superstitious, so far as he is concerned." 

Every mother should put a " social guard " around her home. She can 
not be too particular as to the acquaintances whom her daughters may 
select as their intimate friends ; and she should cultivate politeness. 



78 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP.-EDIA. 

"Politeness is the ritual of society, as prayers are of the Church, a school 
of manners, and a gentle blessing to the age in which it grew. Indeed, 
some good people classify politeness as one of the seven cardinal virtues. 
It certainly keeps us from doing many ungracious acts. The good man- 
ners of those who have no training must be in native goodness of heart, 
which is the secret of all true politeness ; but very few people can always 
trust to that instinct. If they are trained to an habitual politeness, the 
result is most favourable. It inculcates self-restraint, and, although there 
may be the vices of a Chesterfield under the polish, the polite person saves 
the feelings of his intimates, and keeps them from losing their temper at 
the brutality of bad manners. It was sensibly urged by an ouvrier in the 
French Revolution, that he preferred " the tyranny of the aristocrat to the 
tyranny of the mob ; for," said he, " I like better the tramp of a velvet 
slipper on my foot than the kick of a wooden shoe," 

No creathre is all saint and no creature all sinner. A mother, a teacher, 
a preacher, must remember this, and do the best that can be done to make 
out of the people around one amiable members of society. 

We live in a time of great thoughts, in which much is said and done for 
the instruction and elevation of mankind. It is the philanthropic age ; 
the whole sentiment of reforming the masses belongs to our day. When 
we reflect upon how much has been done by men and women like our- 
selves, we can not despair, but still hope that we may do something to- 
wards it ourselves. 

But still it may not be within our p6wer to do more than to make one 
happy and useful home. Let us remember, if we do that, we have helped 
to swell the class of the well-bred, whom one day we hope may predomi- 
nate over the ill-bred. 

" Good manners are the shadows of virtues, if not the virtues them- 
selves." " Company manners," so called, are therefore better than no man- 
ners at all. They are not as good as home manners, real manners ; but 
they may work inwardly. We sometimes gain the real virtue which we 
have only affected. 

Idleness has no place in the model home. Be indefatigable in labour, 
and teach your children to work. The earnest worker finds opportunity 
and help everywhere. It is not accident that make the fortune. It is 
assiduous purpose and work ; and we all know how difficulty and poverty 
have inspired and made great men. To the idle and luxurious, opportu- 
nity offers nothing. The book is necessaiy to the eye ; there must be 
something to take hold of. There is something in industry which is mar- 
vellous. It accomplishes the impossible. It may not always make agree- 



MAKING HOME ATTKACTIVK -, } 

able people at first ; but it usually ends that way. The man of little worth 
and no industry, he who depends upon others, is apt to ba despondent, 
unhappy and querulous. 

The only class possessing abundant leisure, who have a right to be idle, 
are the women who are supported b}^ indulgent fathers and husbands, or 
who are rich in their own right; and it is to this class that we must look 
for the maintenance of the elegancies of life. They do much to preserve 
for us a refined tone of society, if they do nothing else. But we must 
observe that such women are seldom idle. The richest woman in New York 
is the busiest woman. She is never happy unless she is at work. She is 
doing something for every charity helping along young artists, raising 
the poor gifted daughter of poverty to a higher opportunity, lendino- her 
kind hand everywhere. 

Great wealth also brings great responsibilities, and wealthy single 
women do not often take advantage of their wealth to be idle. It is the 
very woman or man who ought to work, who is apt to be incorrigibly lazy. 
Women should be educated to feel that the single life has its duties, 
pleasures, and rich and ample fulfilment as well as the married. " I have 
seen my sisters so unhappy in their wedded lives that I shall never marry, ' 
said one most attractive woman. " I believe nothing is so useful or so 
happy in the present crowded state. of the world as a single life," said 
another. 

Women in the single life have an enviable opportunity to live out their 
own individuality, and they find their place in anybody's home if they are 
good and agreeable. But, so long as they are fussy, sentimental, troubled 
about old love affairs, seeking, after the day for such things has passed, to 
be considered attractive, affected, and coquettish, then the old maid 
deserves the reproach which the vulgar have cast upon her. " It requires 
a very superior woman to be an old maid," said the most delightful old 
maid who ever lived, Miss Catharine Sedgwick. . 

And now for one long, last, lingering look over all the field which w.> 
have swept with our comprehensive broom. 

Home, whenever and whatever it may be, is sacred. It is a place which 
none of us, the worst of us, wish degraded. Unhappy it may be, sordid 
it may be, poor it may be, but we do not wish others to speak ill of it. 
Very few of us wish it broken up, although it may be our sad business to 
leave it. 

It is an inclosure for which we are willing to make vast sacrifices. It 
is the one education which has influenced us powerfully for good or evil. 



80 THE HOME, FARM AND BtSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

What our fathers taught us, what our mothers sang to us, we shall never 
forget. 

The impression we have made upon our children will never pass away. 
The home we have made consciously or unconsciously is the factor in 
their lives of the greatest importance. 

We may have sown the seeds of a positive moral goodness, to see the 
flowers come up, but choked by weeds ; we may have studied household 
education, and have learned the supposed seed-time and harvest of all the 
virtues, and have sown broadcast the grain of integrity, self-denial, energy, 
and industry, yet we have reared only idlers, drunkards, and selfish volup- 
tuaries as the result of our home-training. The seed-time was ours ; the 
harvest is the Lord's. We are not told why we sometimes fail in our best 
efforts, but we know that we do fail. 

We can, therefore, promise no parent success. There are some soils in 
which plants of virtue will not grow. Nor is character dependent either 
upon instruction or training. The good son and the bad son grow up by 
the same fireside. It is the use which each will make of his opportunities 
which will determine the question. And even the best people must go 
through deep trials before character is perfected. To live unselfishly to 
good aims, to rise above our daily and hourly temptations, to do our duty 
whether rewarded or not these are our stepping-stones. 

But, whether destined to be successful or unsuccessful, all people should 
try to make a home whose influence shall be good. Whether humble or 
important, our duty remains the same to make a good home according to 
our lights. 

We live in an age which has thrown away tradition, yet it will not hurt 
us to read of the past, with its trainings and teachings, its formal precepts 
its stiff manners, its respect for elders, its old-school customs. Let us aim 
to take for our model all that was good in that sort of home. 

Then let us read of the homes which have formed the great and good 
and useful people of our Pantheon. We may see, as in the case of Mary 
Russell Mitford, how a wretched and worthless father developed the most 
generous and useful of daughters. We may learn in almost all biographies 
some great lesson of virtue born of trouble. We shall have to accept many 
a story of worthless children who have not been made good by anything ; 
many worthless parents who have made their children unhappy ; but we 
shall occasionally be refreshed by a well-spring of such delightful fresh- 
ness that we shall have strength given us wherewith to struggle on. 

And character, when fine, is such a very remunerative thing to the mind 
which needs help ! We almost welcome any suffering if it would make

us so strong, noble, true as some people have been. We sometimes look 
back through our tears, and see what a large place a certain character we 
have known has filled in the lives of all who knew him. A hard-work- 
ing country doctor may have been, as we look up his record after death, a 
Sir Philip Sidney, an Admirable Crichton, a Carlo Borromeo. We remem- 
ber his mirth, his cheerfulness, his courtesy, his wit, his industiy, faith- 
fulness, and unselfishness. We remember how he came into the sick-room 
at early morning, bringing flowers with the dew on them for his sufterino- 
patient, and we follow him through the years of his beneficent but unre- 
corded life, saying, " This was character." 

So of many a woman unknown to fame, we remember how bravely she 
met calamity and shame, brought to her by the man who had sworn to 
love and to protect. We remember how cheerfully she worked for him 
and for her children, never losing her faith in human nature, how she was 
capable of seeing others succeed without envy, how pure her heart, how 
equable her temper. We remember how she made home happy, and how 
pretty and agreeable she was, although her mornings were given to music 
lessons and her afternoons to drudgery. No one would have suspected, as 
she gathered her lambs about her evening wood fire, that she had been 
keeping the wolf from the door. This was character. 

And we remember the man who all through his life lived under an un- 
just suspicion to shield a brother or a son. We think of the old man to 
whom came domestic trials of the hardest, yet who never lost his faith. 

We think of the brilliant woman of society, who stuffs her wounds with 
brocade, and never lets the world see that she bleeds inwardly. She has 
swallowed her troubles. She can work for that worthless, that drunken 
son. No one will know that she does it. It is necessary for the other 
members of her family that she keep up that home in its supposed splen- 
dour. It is only another sleepless year to her ! What does it matter ? 
This is character. 

So long as men and women remember that home is the anchor of the 
State, so long will they be doing their duty to themselves, to their country, 
and to God. 

We have not been able to lay down any definite and unalterable rules. 
The hours of rising, of retiring, of taking meals, of dressing, receiving 
company, and of allowing either gaiety or sobriety to rule the house, this 
must be left to the sense, taste, and discretion of every householder. 

Almost all people of sense agree as to the advantages of early rising and 
punctuality and economy and general good manners. It may seem very 
commonplace to even allude to them. It is to that higher instinct which 



82 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

lies behind good reputation to which we would appeal. It is to the sacred 
sense of the reality of home. It is to the feeling that Wordsworth ex- 
presses in his well-known lines respecting those 

" who never roam. 

True to the sacred points of heaven and home." 

Still less have we been able to tell parents, except very generally, what 
books their children should read. We are very great believers in fairy 
tales, and think that the nursery circle should be entertained by the 
mother in reading aloud those delightfully fantastic productions of Grimm 
and others who have explored the world under the fern-leaves. There is 
no danger that these stories will make liars of children, as some conscien- 
tious people have feared. A child perceives at once the difference between 

fact and fancy. 

And the fairy stories are as true as " Sandford and Merton" or the " 
Books." Let children read both. Let the delicate instruction which fil- 
ters through " Jack and the Bean-Stalk," " Cinderella," and through the 
immortal pages of the " Arabian Nights," reach a youthful mind early. 
These books give an elegance and a fulness to the intellect of a child 
which no practical book can reach. A child is nearer heaven than we are 
he still sees the unseen. 

" And trailing clouds of glory, does he come 
From God, who is his home. 

We should remember that his clear and unpolluted mind still revels in 
dimly remembered wonders, of which we have lost sight, and the univer- 
sal craving of a child's mind for the wonderful is not to be despised. 

As for the growing man and woman, we can only say : give them good 
books at first, and they will never wish for any other. Form a taste, and 
then turn them into a well-selected library. If a little girl comes to her 
mother and asks, " What shall I read ? " she should always be helped to a 
good book. But, after her tastes are pronounced, she will read what she 
likes or will not read at all. 

And we would earnestly urge upon American mothers to go into society 
with their daughters, to make the greatest effort to be with them, to know 
well their intimates, to keep young for their daughters' sake. It is very 
often that, with small means and with young children, a mother finds her- 
self unable to do this thing. Indeed, it is sometimes the case that a 
mother economizes on her own dress in order that her daughter may be 
better dressed, and stays at home herself to send her daughter. This is a 
great mistake. The mother's presence as chaperon to her daughter would 



OX THE MAXAQEMEXT OF MOXEY. 83 

have saved us much national scandal. In families of good ancestry 
where good manners have been transmitted, we find always the mother a 
prominent feature in society. In families of no antecedents, those who 
t make a family, certainly this rule should be even more vigorously 

llowed. We would have no reproach of " fast girls "if dignified mothers 
watched over their daughters' amusements. 

If parents wish their children to be loving, appreciative, and grateful 
they should teach them to reverence and to obey. If they wish them to 
be graceful, accomplished, refined, they must surround them with these ad- 
vantages at home. They must teach them not only those principles of 
-breeding which spring from the heart, but they must tell them of 
the immense force which lies in social good-breeding and in pleasant 
manners. 

And if we could compress into one golden sentence the nearest approach 
5 a formula for home happiness, it would be this : Be as polite to one an- 
ther as if all were strangers. Do not let the intimacy of home break 
lown a single barrier of self-control. Let every member of the family 
studiously respect the rights-moral, intellectual, and physical-of every 
ther member. Let each one refrain from attacking the convictions of the 
ither. \V e should not so treat a stranger. Why our own ? 

' Ptill in thy right haiid carry gentle peace, 
To silence envious tongues. " 

XIV. 
ON THE MANAOEMENT OF MONEY. 

BY LORD LYTTOX. 

(Addressed chiefly to the Young.) 

IN a work of fiction I once wrote this sentence, which, perhaps, may be 
found, if considered, suggestive of some practical truths " Money is 
character," 

In the humbler grades of life, certainly character is money. The man 

ho gives me his labour in return for the wages which the labour is 

worth, pledges to me something more than his labour he pledges to me 

rtain qualities of his moral being, such as honesty, sobriety, and dili- 

f, m these respects, he maintain his character, he will have my 

ley as long as I want his labour ; and when I want his labour no 

onger, his character is money's worth to him for somebody else. If, in

addition to the moral qualities I have named, he establish a character for 
other attributes which have their own price in the money market- 
exhibits a superior intelligence, skill, energy, zeal-his labour rises 
value Thus in the humblest class of life, character is money ; and acc< 
ing as the man earns or spends the money, money in turn becomes char- 

C As money is the most evident power in the world's uses, so the use that 
he makes of money is often all that the world knows about a man. 
our money gained justly and spent prudently ? our character establishes 
a claim on respect. Is it gained nobly and spent beneficently ? our char- 
acter commands more than respect-it wins a place in that higher spher 
of opinion which comprises admiration, gratitude, love. Is money inherit 
without merit of ours, lavished recklessly away ? our character disperse 
itself with the spray of the golden shower-it is not the money alone 
which we are spendthrifts. Is money meanly acquired, selfishly hoard* 
it is not the money alone of which we are misers ; we are starving ou 
own human hearts, depriving them of their natural ailment in the appro' 
al and affection of others. We invest the money which we fancy so si 
out at compound interest in the very worst possession a man can purchase 
-viz an odious reputation. In fact, the more we look round the more 
we shall come to acknowledge that there is no test of a man's character 
more generally adopted than the way in which his money is managed. 
Money is a terrible blab ; she will betray the secrets of her owner what- 
ever he do to gag her. His virtues will creep out in her whisper, 1 
vices she will cry aloud at the top of her tongue. 

But the management of money is an art ? True ; but that which we 
call an art means an improvement, and not a deterioration, of a something 
existent already in nature; and the artist can only succeed in improving 
his art in proportion as he improves himself in the qualities which the art 
demands in the artist. Now the management of money is, m much, the 
management of self. If Heaven allotted to each man seven guardian an 
gels, five of them at least would be found night and day hovering ovei 



first rule of the art of managing money all preceptors must be 
agreed. It is told in three words, " Horror of Debt." 
"Nurse cherish, never cavil away, the wholesome horror of DEBT. 
sonal liberty is the paramount essential to human dignity, and human 
happiness. Man hazards the condition and loses the virtues of freemar 
in proportion as he accustoms his thoughts to view, without anguish an 
shame his lapse into the bondage of debtor. Debt is to man what the 



ON THE MANAGEMENT OF MONEY. 85 

serpent is to the bird ; its eye fascinates, its breath poisons, its coil 
crushes sinew and bone, its jaw is the pitiless grave. If you mock my 
illustration, if you sneer at the truth it embodies, give yourself no farther 
trouble to learn how to manage your money. Consider yourself doomed ; 
pass on your way with a jaunty step ; the path is facile paths to Aver- 
nus always are. But if, while I write, your heart, true to the instinct of 
manhood, responds to my words if you say, " Agreed ; that which you 
call the first rule for the management of money, I hold yet more impera- 
tive as the necessity to freedom and the life-spring of probity" then 
advance on your way, assured that wherever it wind it must ascend. You 
see but the temple of Honour ; close behind it is the temple of Fortune. 
You will pass through the one to the other. 

" But," sighs the irresolute youth, whom the eye of the serpent has al- 
ready charmed, " it is by no means so easy to keep out of debt as it is to 
write warnings against getting into it." 

Easy to keep out of debt ? Certainly not. Nothing in life worth an 
effort is easy. Do you expect to know the first six books of Euclid by 
inspiration ? Could you get over that problem in the first book, popularly 
called the Ass's Bridge, without a sigh of fatigue ? Can you look back to 
the rudimentary agonies of the Multiplication Table and the Rule of 
Three, or As in prcesenti, or even Propria qua; maribus, without a lively 
recollection of the moment when you fairly gave in, and said, "This is 
too much for human powers ?" Even in things the pleasantest, if we wish 
to succeed we must toil. We are all Adam's children. Whatever we cul- 
ture on earth, till we win our way back into Eden, we must earn by the 

sweat of our brain. Not even the Sybarite was at ease on his rose-bed 

even for him some labour was needful. No hand save his own could un- 
crumple the rose-leaf that chafed him. Each object under the sun reflects 
a difficulty on the earth. " Every hair," says that exquisite Publius Syrus, 

whose fragments of old verse are worth libraries of modern comedies 

" every hair casts its shadow." 

But think, oh, young man ! of the object I place before you, and then 
be ashamed of yourself if you still sigh, " Easy to preach, and not easy to 
practise." I have no interest in the preaching ; your interest is immense 
in the practice. That object not won, your heart has no peace, and your 
hearth no security. Your conscience itself leaves a door open night and 
day to the tempter ; night and day to the ear of a debtor steal whispers 
that prompt to the deeds of a felon. Three years ago you admired the 
rising success of some most respectable man. Where is he now 1 In the 
dock in the jail in the hulks ? What ! that opulent banker, whose 






86 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

plate dazzled princes ? or that flourishing clerk, who drove the high-step- 
ping horse to his office ? The same. And his crime ? Fraud and 
swindling. What demon could urge so respectable a man to so shameful 
an act ? I know not the name of the demon, but the cause of the crime 
the wretch tells you himself. Ask him : what is his answer ? "I got 
into debt no way to get out of it but the way which I took to the dock, 
to the jail, to the hulks !" 

Easy to keep out of debt ! iNo, my young friend, it is difficult. Are 
you rich ? The bland tradesman cries, " Pay when you please." Your 
rents or your father's allowance will not be due for three months ; your 
purse in the mean while can not afford you some pleasant vice or some in- 
nocent luxury, which to young heirs seems a want. You are about to 
relinquish the vice or dispense with the luxury ; a charming acquaintance, 
who lives no one knows how, though no one lives better, introduces an 
amiable creature, sleek as a cat, with paws of velvet hiding claws of steel, 
his manners are pleasing, his calling usury. You w r ant the money for 
three months. Why say three ? Your name to a bill for six months, and 
the vice or the luxury is yours the next hour ! Certainly the easy thing 
here is to put your name to the bill. Presto ! you are in debt the demon 
has you down in his books. 

Are you poor ? Still your character is yet without stain, and your char- 
acter is a property on which you can borrow a trifle. But when you 
borrow on your character, it is your character that you leave in pawn. 
The property to you is priceless, and the loan that subjects it to be a 
pledge unredeemed is a trifle. 

Young friend, be thou patrician or plebeian, learn to say No at the first 
to thy charming acquaintance. The worst that the " No" can inflict on 
thee is a privation a want always short of starvation. No young man, 
with the average health of youth, need be in danger of starving. But, 
despite that privation or want, thy youth itself is such riches that there is 
not a purse-proud old millionaire of sixty who, provided thy good name 
be unsoiled, would not delightedly change with thee. Be contented ! Say 
No ! Keep unscathed the good name, keep out of peril the honour, with- 
out which even yon battered old soldier, who is hobbling into his grave on 
half-pay and a wooden leg, would not change with Achilles. 

Here I pause, seemingly to digress, really to enlarge the scope of my 
reasoning. In the world around and without us there are first principles 
which dely all philosophy. We may arrive with Newton at the law of 
gravitation ; there we stop. " We enquire no more," says Sir William 



ON THE MANAGEMENT OF MONEY. 87 

Hamilton, " although ignorant now as previously of the cause of gravi- 
tation." 

But man in himself is a world ; and in man's moral organization there 
are also first principles, on which the more we would dispute the more 
likely we are to be led astray. All things can be argued upon ; and 
therefore, if we so choose, we may be argued out of all things the best for 
us. There are some things for men and nations which it is safest never 
to submit to an argument. I would not, as an Englishman, permit trial 
by jury, or the right of habeas cot'pus, or the honour of the national flag, 
or the privilege of asylum to political exiles to become open questions for 
the casuists of other lands to refine into ignorant prejudices on the part of 
my old-fashioned country. So, as a human being, in myself integral and 
independent as sovereign in free-will as any state on earth, however 
numerous its citizens, however imperial its sceptre there are certain 
things which I will not allow to be open questions ; I assume them as 
indispensable to my own completeness of human being. I grant that a 
great deal may be said against them, as there may be against trial by 
jury and the honour of our flag ; but I have made up my mind to main- 
tain and not to discuss them, not because I doubt that all hostile argu- 
ments could be triumphantly answered, but because I may not be such a 
proficient in casuistry as to be able to satisfy others ; and in striving to 
do so I may unsettle in my own mind the foundation of all that I know 
to be both the temples and bulwarks of my existence as man. I will not 
consent to make open questions of aught without which I should think it 
a merc3 T if I were hanged as a dog. I have read very subtile arguments 
against the probabilities that my frame holds a soul that my present life 
involves a hereafter. I have read arguments no less subtile against the 
wisdom and almost against the existence of every conceivable virtue. I 
could quote pages by writers of no mean ability to show that common 
honesty is a vulgar error. So that, in fact, if. I were to deliver up my 
whole self to the arbitrament of special pleaders, to-day I might be argued 
into an atheist, and to-morrow into a pick-pocket. Therefore I say to 
the young man about entering life as a free agent, Whenever you are 
te^npted to do something which you have beon brought up by honest 
parents and teachers to know to be wrong, do not argue about it yon 
can at least hold your tongue. Without an argument you may commit 
the fault, repent, and atone it, because you have not frittered away the 
conviction that you have done wrong; but if you once make the wrong 
an open question, and consent to argue with perhaps a more practiced 
casuist than yourself his argument taking part with your temptation 






88 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

then the chance is that you do more than a wrong thing, that you do 
wrong upon philosophical system, and will very soon substitute custom 
for conscience. Never be argued out of your soul, never be argued out of 
your honour, and never be argued into believing that soul and honour do 
not run a terrible risk if you limp into life with the load of a debt on 
your shoulders, and, as the debt grows heavy and heavier, the hiss of some 
tying fiend in your ear, " Shake it off; you need not be bankrupt ; there 
is an alternative." " Oh, heavens ! what alternative, say ! " and the fiend 
whispers low, suasive words for the fiends argue well suasive words 
which, put in plain English, mean this : " Be a cheat ; be a swindler." 

Shake hands, brave young friend ; we are agreed. You consent to 
have horror of debt. You will abstain, you will pinch, you will work 
harder and harder, if needful. You will not slink through the crowd as 
a debtor. 

Now comes the next danger. You will not incur debt for yourself, 
but you have a friend. Pythias, your friend, your familiar the man you 
like best and see most of says to you, " Damon, be my security your 
name to this bill ! " Heaven forbid that I should cry out to Damon, 
"Pythias means to cheat thee beware !" But I address to Damon this 
observation : " Pythias asks thee to guarantee that three, six, or twelve 
months hence he will pay to another man say to Dionysius so many 
pounds sterling." Here your first duty as an honest man is not to Pyth- 
ias, but to Dionysius. Suppose some accident happen one of these 
which, however impossible it may seem to Pythias, constantly happen to 
the Pythiases of other Damons who draw bills on the bank of Futurity ; 
suppose that the smut or the rain spoil the crops on which Pythias relies, 
or the cargoes he expects from Marseilles, California, Utopia, go down to 
the bottomless seas Dionysus must come upon you ! Can you pay to 
Dionysius what you pledge yourself to pay to him in spite of those acci- 
dents ? He thinks those accidents not only possible, but probable, or he 
would not require your surety, nor charge twenty per cent, for his loan ; 
and, therefore, since he clearly doubts Pythias, his real trust is in you. 
Do not merit the trust ? Can you pay the money if Pythias can not ? and, 
allowing that you pay the money, are your other obligations in life su*h 
as to warrant that sacrifice to Friendship ? If you can not pay, or if you owe 
it to others more sacred than Pythias himself owe it to your parents, 
your plighted bride, or wedded wife, or the children to whom, what, before 
their birth, was your fortune, has become the trust money for their pro- 
vision not to hazard for Pythias that for which, if lost, not you alone 
but others must suffer, then do not common duty and common honesty 



ON THE MANAGEMENT OF MONEY. 89 

forbid you to become surety to Pythias for an obligation which it belongs 
not to Pythias but to Chance to fulfil ? I am the last man to say, " Do 
not help your friend," if you honourably can. If we have money, we 
manage it ill when we can not help a friend at a pinch. But the plain 
fact is this : Pythias wants money. Can you give it, at whatever stint to 
yourself, injustice to others ? If you can, and you value Pythias more 
than the money, give the money, and there is an end of it ; but if you 
can not give the money, don't sign the bill. Do not become what, in rude 
truth, you do become a knave and a liar if you guarantee to do what 
you know that you can not do should the guarantee be exacted. He is 
generous who gives ; he who lends may be generous also, but only on one 
condition, viz., that he can afford to give what he can afford to lend ; 
of the two, therefore, it is safer, friendlier, cheaper in the long-run to give 
than to lend. Give, and you may keep j'our friend if you lose your 
money ; lend, and the chances are that you lose your friend if ever you 
get back your money. 

But if you do lend, let it be with the full conviction that the loan is a 
gift, and count it among the rarest favours of Providence if you be ever 
repaid. Lend to Pythias on the understanding, " This is a loan if you 
ever can repay me. I shall, however, make this provision against the 
chances of a quarrel between us, that if you can not repay me it stands as 
a gift." 

And whatever you lend, let it be your money, and not your name. 
Money you may get again, and, if not, you may contrive to do without it ; 
name once lost you can not get again, and if you can contrive to do with- 
out it, you had better never have been born. 

With honour, poverty is a Noble; without honour, wealth is a Pauper. 
Is it not so ? Every young man not corrupted says " Yes." It is only 
some wretched old cynic, no drop of warm blood in his veins, who says, 
" Life is a boon without honour." 

But if a Jew knock at your door and show you a bill with your name 
as a promise to pay, and the bill be dishonoured, pray what becomes of 
your name ? 

" My name ! " falters Damon. " I am but a surety ; go to Pythias." 
" Pythias has bolted ! " 

Pa}' the bill, Damon, or good-bye to your honour ! 

Pardon my prolixity ; earnestness is apt to be garrulous. Vixi ! I 
have lived and known life. And, alas, what careers bright in promise I 
have seen close in jail or in exile ; what talents, profuse in their blossom, 
die off without coming to fruit ; what virtues the manliest rot into vices 



90 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

the meanest, which, when one cried in amazement, " How account for so 
doleful an end to so fair a commencement ? " solve their whole mystery 
in this : " Damon never recovered his first fatal error ; Damon put his 
name to a bill by which Pythias promised to pay so and so in three 
months." 

Having settled these essential preliminaries 1. Never to borrow where 
there is a chance, however remote, that you may not be able to repay ; 2. 
Never to lend what you are not prepared to give ; 3. Never to guarantee 
for another what you can not fulfil if the other should fail you start in 
life with this great advantage : whatever you have, be it little or much, 
is your own. Kich or poor, you start as a freeman, resolved to preserve 
in your freedom the noblest condition of your being as a man. 

Now fix your eyes steadily on some definite end in the future. Con- 
sider well what you chiefly wish to be ; then compute at the lowest that 
which you are by talent, and at the highest that which you can be by 
labour. Always under estimate the resources of talent ; always put as 
against you the chances of luck. Then set down on the other side, as 
against talent defective, against luck adverse, all that which can be placed 
to the credit of energy, patience, perseverance. These last are infinite ; 
whatever be placed against them is finite ; you are on the right side of 
any system of book-keeping by double-entry on which a mortal may pre- 
sume to calculate accounts with Fate. 

The finest epithet for genius is that which was applied to Newton's 
genius, " patient." He who has patience, coupled with energy, is sure, 
sooner or later, to obtain the results of genius ; he who has genius without 
patience and without energy (if, indeed, such genius be a thing possible) 
might as well have no genius at all. His works and aims, like the plants 
of Nature before the Deluge, are characterized by the slightness of their 
roots. 

Fortune is said to be blind, but her favourites never are. Ambition has 
the eye of the eagle, Prudence that of the lynx ; the first looks through the 
air, the last along the ground. 

The man who succeeds above his fellows is the one who, early in life, 
clearly discerns his object, and toward that object habitually directs his 
powers. Thus, indeed, even genius itself is but fine observation strength- 
ened by fixity of purpose. Every man who observes vigilantly and re- 
solves steadfastly grows unconsciously into genius. 

Assuming that fortune be your object, let your first efforts be not for 
wealth, but independence. Whatever be your talents, whatever your 
prospects, never be tempted to speculate away, on the chance of a palace, 



ON THE MANAGEMENT OF MONEY. 91 

that which you need as a provision against the work-house. Youth is too 
apt to exclaim, " Aut Cfesar aut nullus." But that saying was only for a 
Cjesar ; and even for him it was not a wise one. To a Caesar there should 
have been no Aut. Nemesis sighed " Aut nullus" when Ciesar fell at the 
feet of the marble Pompey. 

A daring trader hazards the halter if he says " Rothschild or nothing;" 
a philosopher will end as a charlatan if he says " Aristotle or nothing ; " a 
fentleman who says " Sir Philip Sidney or nothing " is on the eve of be- 
cominc a blackleg. The safe maxim is this : " The highest I can be, but 
on no account nullus." 

Let your first care be, then, independence. Without pecuniary inde- 
pendence you are not even intellectually free ; with independence, even 
though it be gained through some occupation which you endure as a drud- 
gery, still, out of the twenty-four hours, there will be always some hours 
for the occupation in which you delight. 

This observation applies in fullest force to aspirants in literature. It 
is my cruel fate to receive no unfrequent communications from youths 
whose calling is that of the counter, whose tastes are those of Parnassus ; 
and the pitch of these unsolicited communications is invariably this : 

" I gain so many shillings a week by a vulgar and detestable trade ; but 
I have a soul above buttons. Read the MSS. I inclose. Do you not think 
there is some merit in them ? Could I not succeed as an author ? I have 
had disadvantages to encounter so had Burns. I can not boast of a 
scholastic education : I have had very little leisure to educate myself ; 
still " et cetera, et cetera, all the et cetera involving the same question : 
" As I am unfit to be an apprentice, am I not fit to be an author ? Not 
having enough- of human intelligence, perseverance, and energy to excel 
as a hatter, a tailor, a butcher, a baker, may I not be a Walter Scott or a 
Byron ? " 

Useless I solemnly warn all such contingent correspondents as may 
now be looming ominously among other unwelcome clouds that menace 
my few holiday hours useless to apply to me. Be the specimens of 
genius under difficulties thus volunteered to my eye good, bad, or indiffer- 
ent, my answer, as an honest man, can be only this , " Keep to the calling 
that assures you a something out of which you may extract independence 
until you are independent. Give to that calling all your heart, all your 
mind. If I were hatter, or tailor, or butcher, or baker, I should resolve 
to consider my calling the best in the world, and devote to it the best of 
my powers. Independence once won, then be Byron or Scott if you can." 



92 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Independence ! independence ! the right and the power to follow the 
bent of your genius without fear of the bailiff and dun should be your 
first inflexible aim. To attain independence, so apportion your expendi- 
ture as to spend less than you have or you earn. Make this rule impera- 
tive. I know of none better. Lay by something every year, if it be but 
a shilling. A shilling laid by, net and clear from a debt, is a receipt in 
full for all claims in the past, and you go on with light foot and light 
heart to the future. " How am I to save and lay by ? " saith the author, 
or any other man of wants more large than his means. The answer is 
obvious : " If you can not increase your means, then you must diminish 
your wants." Every skilled labourer of fair repute can earn enough not 
to starve, and a surplus beyond that bare sufficiency. Yet many a skilled 
labourer suffers more from positive privation than the unskilled rural 
peasant. Why ? Because he encourages wants in excess of his means. 

A man of 300 a year, living up to that income, truly complains of pov- 
erty ; but if he live at the rate of 250 a year, he is comparatively rich. 
" Oh," says Gentility, " but I must have this or that, which necessitates 
the yearly 50 you ask me to save I must be genteel." Why that must ? 
That certain folk may esteem you ? Believe me, they esteem you much 
more for a balance at your banker's than for that silver teapot or that 
mannikin menial in sugar-loaf buttons. " But," says Parental Affection, 
" I must educate my boy ; that 50 saved from my income is the cost of 
his education." Is it so ? Can all the school-masters in Europe teach 
him a nobler lesson than that of a generous thrift, a cheerful and brave 
self-denial '. If the 50 be really the sum which the boy's schooling 
needs, and you can spare nothing else from your remaining 250, still save 
and lay by for a year, and during that year let the boy study at home, by 
seeing how gladly you all are saving for him. Then the next year the 
schooling is the present which you all father, mother, and sister by 
many slight acts of self-denial, have contrived to make to your boy. And 
if he be a boy of good heart, a boy such as parents so thoughtful nearly 
always rear, he will go to his school determined to make up to you for all 
the privations he has seen those he loves endure for his sake. 

You may tell me that practically it comes to the same thing, for the 
school goes on, and next year you must equally pinch for the 50. True ; 
but there is this mighty difference, you are a year in advance of the sum ; 
and, the habit of saving thus formed, you may discover something else that 
\villbeararetrenchment. He who saves for one year finds the security, 
pleasure, and pride in it a luxury so great that his invention will be quick- 
ened to keep it. Lay by ! lay by ! What makes the capital of nations ? 



ON THE MANAGEMENT OF MONEY. 93 

Savings ; nothing else. Neither nations nor men are safe against fortunes 
unless they can hit on a system by which they save more than they spend. 
When that system is once established, at what a ratio capital accumulates ! 
What resources the system gradually develops ! In that one maxim is the 
secret of England's greatness ! Do you think it mean to save more than 
you spend ? You do in that what alone gives your country its rank in 
the universe. The system so grand for an empire can not be mean for a 

citizen. 

Well, we have now added another rule to the canons prescribed to the 
Management of Money : save more than you spend. Whatever your 
means be, so apportion your wants that your means may exceed them. 
Every man who earns but ten shillings a week can do this if he please, 
whatever he may say to the contrary ; for if he can live upon ten shil- 
lin^s a week, he can live upon nine and elevenpence. 

In this rule mark the emphatic distinction between poverty and needi- 
ness. Poverty is relative, and therefore not ignoble ; Neediness is a 
positive degradation. If I have only 100 a year, I am rich as compared 
with the majority of my countrymen. If I have 5000 a year, I may be 
poor as compared with the majority of my associates, and very poor com- 
pared to my next-door neighbour. With either of these incomes I am 
relatively poor or rich ; but with either of these incomes I may be posi- 
tively needy, or positively free from neediness. With the 100 a year I 
may need no man's help ; I may at least have " my crust of bread and 
liberty." But with 5000 a year I may dread a ring at my bell ; I may 
have my tyrannical masters in servants whose wages I can not pay ; my 
exile may be at the fiat of the first long-suffering man who enters a 
judgment against me ; for the flesh that lies nearest to my heart some 
Shylock may be dusting his scales and whetting his knife. Nor is this 
an exaggeration. Some of the neediest men I ever knew have a nominal 
5000 a year. Every man is needy who spends more than he has ; no 
man is needy who spends less. I may so ill manage my money that, with 
5000 a year, I purchase the worst evils of poverty terror and shame ; I 
may so well manage my money that, with 100 a year, I purchase the 
best blessings of wealth safety and respect, Man is a kingly animal. 
In every state which does not enslave him, it is not labour which makes 
him less loyally lord of himself it is fear. 

" Rex est qui metuit nihil, 
Et hoc regmim sibi quisque det." 

Money is character money also is power. I have power not in propor- 
tion to the money I spend on myself, but in proportion to the money 



94 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP.EDIA. 

I can, if I please, give away to another. We feel this as we advance 
in years. How helpless is an old man who has not a farthin^ to 
give or to leave ! But be moderately amiable, grateful, and kind, and 
though you have neither wife nor child, you will never -want a 
wife's tenderness nor a child's obedience if you have something to leave 
or to give. This reads like satire ; it is sober truth. 

But now we arrive at the power of money well managed. You have 
got money you have it ; and, with it, the heart, and the sense, and the 
taste to extract from the metal its uses. Talk of the power of knowledge ! 
What can knowledge invent that money can not purchase ? Money, it is 
true, can not give you the brain of the philosopher, the eye of the painter, 
the ear of the musician, nor that inner sixth sense of beauty and truth by 
which the poet unites in himself philosopher, painter, musician ; but 
money can refine and exalt your existence with all that philosopher, 
painter, musician, poet, accomplish. That which they are your wealth 
can not make you, but that which they do is at the command of your 
wealth. You may collect in your libraries all thoughts which all thinkers 
have confided to books ; your galleries may teem with the treasures of 
art ; the air that you breathe may be vocal with music ; better than all, 
when you summon the Graces, they can come to your call in their sweet 
name of Charities. You can build up asylums for age, and academies for 
youth. Pining Merit may spring to hope at your voice, and "Poverty 
grow cheerful in your sight." Money well managed deserves, indeed, the 
apotheosis to which she was raised by her Latin adorers; she is Diva 
Moneta a goddess. 

I have said that he who sets out in life with the resolve to acquire 
money should place clearly before him some definite object to which the 
money is but the means. He thus sweetens privation and dignifies thrift. 
Money never can be well managed if sought solely through the greed of 
money for its own sake. In all meanness there is a defect of intellect as 
well as of heart. And even the cleverness of avarice is but the cunning 
of imbecility. 

The first object connected with money is the security for individual 
freedom pecuniary independence. That once gained, whatever is surplus 
becomes the fai** capital for reproductive adventure. Adhere but to this 
rule in every speculation, however tempting, preserve free from all hazard 
that which you require to live on without depending upon others. 

It is a great motive to economy, a strong safe-guard to conduct, and a 
wonderful stimulant to all mental power, if you can associate your toil for 
money with some end dear to your affections. I once knew a boy of good 



OX THE MANAGEMENT OF MONEY. 95 

parts, but who seemed incorrigibly indolent. His father, a professional 
man, died suddenly, leaving his widow and son utterly destitute. The 
widow resolved to continue the education of her boy, however little lie 
had hitherto profited by it engaged herself as teacher at a school, and 
devoted her salary to her son. From that moment the boy began to work 
in good earnest. He saw the value of money in this world ; he resolved 
to requite his mother to see her once more in a home of her own ; he 
distinguished himself at school ; he obtained, at the age of sixteen, an 
entry in a mercantile house. At the age of twenty his salary enabled him 
to place his mother in a modest suburban lodging, to which he came home 
every night. At the age of thirty he was a rich man, and, visitin^ him 
at his villa, I admired his gardens. He said to me, simply, " I have no 
taste for flowers myself, but my mother is passionately fond of them. I 
date my first step in life from my resolve to find her a home ; and the 
invention in my business to which I owe my rise from clerk to partner 
could never have come into my brain, and been patiently worked out, if, 
night and day, I had not thought of my mother's delight in flowers." 

A common motive with a young man is an honest love for the girl 
whom he desires to win as his wife. Nay, if no such girl yet has been 
met on the earth, surely she lives for him in the cloudland of Fancy. 
Wedlock, and wedlock for love, is the most exquisite hope in the inner- 
most heart of every young man who labours ; it is but the profligate idlers 
who laugh at that sacred ideal. But it is only the peasant or mechanic 
who has the right to marry on no other capital than that which he takes 
from nature in sinews and thews. The man whose whole condition of 
being is in his work from day to day must still have his helpmate. He 
finds his helpmate in one who can work like himself if his honest industry 
fail her. I preach to the day-labourer no cold homilies from political 
economy. The happiness and morality of the working class necessitate 
early marriages; and for prudent provision against the chances of illness 
and death there are benefit clubs and societies, which must stand in lieu 
of jointure and settlement. But to men of a higher grade in this world's 
social distinctions, Hymen must generally contrive to make some kind of 
compromise with Plutus. I grant that your fond Amaryllis would take 
your arm to the altar though you have not a coat to your back ; but 
Amaryllis may have parents who not unreasonably ask, " How, young 
Strephon, can you maintain our daughter ? and if your death demolish all 
those castles in the air which you are now building without brick and 
mortar, under what roof will she lay her head ? " 



96 THE HOHE, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

And suppose that no parents thus unkindly interpose between Amaryl- 
lis and you, still it is a poor return to the disinterested love of Ama- 
ryllis to take her, thoughtless child, at her word. Amaryllis proves her 
unselfish love ; prove yours, my friend Strephon. Wait hope strive ; 
her ring is on your finger ; her picture, though it be but a villainous 
photograph, hangs by your bedside ; her image is safe in the innermost 
fold of your heart. Wait till you can joyously say, " Come, Amaryllis, 
Plutus relaxes his frown ; here is a home which, if humble, at least is se- 
cure ; and if death suddenly snatch me away, here is no castle in air for 
my widow, Amaryllis shall never live upon alms ! " 

How your love will deepen and strengthen in that generous delay ; and 
with your love, how your whole nature, mental and moral, will deepen 
and strengthen ! Here, indeed, is an object for climbing the rough paths 
on to fortune ; and here the first friendly opposition of Plutus only 
serves to place upon surer foundations the blessings promised by Hymen. 
Constancy in love necessitates patience and perseverance in all efforts for 
fortune ; and with patience and perseverance, a man of fair average capa- 
cities is the master of fortune. 

But there are lesser objects than those I have defined as the most fre- 
quently coveted which lend a charm to the making of money. 

It is a motive to economy, and a dissuasion from many profitless fol- 
lies, to cherish early in life one favourite hobby, provided the hobby be 
sound and well-bred. 

The taste for books, and the desire to collect them, are no mean tests 
of a school-boy's career as man. 

One of the most distinguished personages in Europe, showing me his 

library which is remarkable for its extent and its quality (it was formed 

on the principle of including all works that treat, directly or indirectly, 
on the human mind, and thus, necessarily includes almost every book 
worth reading) said to me, " Not only this collection, but my social suc- 
cesses in life, I trace back to the first franc I saved from the cake shop to 
spend on the book-stall. When I was a young man, and received an in- 
vitation to a ball, not being then rich, I calculated what it would cost me 
in kid gloves and coach hire, and, refusing the ball, bought a book with 
the money. The books I bought I read : the books I read influenced my 
career." Perhaps this eminent person might have thought of the balls 
thus refused in his early youth when, being still young, he gave his own 
rirst ball as Prime Minister. 

But hobbies should be wives, not mistresses. It will not do to have 
more than one at a time. One hobby leads you out of extravagance ; a 



OX THE MANAGEMENT OF MONEY. 



97 



team of hobbies you cannot drive till you are rich enough to find corn 
for them all. Few men are rich enough for that. 

In the management of money there are some things we do for show 

wisely if we can afford it. Money is station as well as character and 
power. 

In matters of show, it is better to have one decided success than fifty 
expensive failures. Better to have one first-rate picture in a modest 
drawing-room than fifty daubs in a pompous gallery. Better to have one 
handsome horse in a brougham than four screws in a drag. Better to 
give one pleasant tea party than a dozen detestable dinners. 

A man of very moderate means can generally afford one effect meant 
for show, as a requisite of station, which, of its kind, may not be sur- 
passed by a millionaire. Those who set the fashions in London are never 
the richest people. Good taste is intuitive with some persons, but it may 
be acquired by all who are observant. In matters of show, good taste is 
the elementary necessity: after good taste, concentration of purpose. 
With money as with genius, the wise master of his art says, " There is 
one thing I can do well ; that one thing I will do as well as I can," 
Money, like genius, is effective in proportion as it is brought to bear on 
one thing at a time. Money, like genius, may comprehend success in a 
hundred things, but still, as a rule, one thing at a time ; that thing must 
be completed or relinquished before you turn to another. 

For a young man of a gentleman's station and a cadet's income, the only 
show needed is that which probably pleases himself the most the effect 
produced by his own personal appearance. Dress will therefore not un- 
reasonably, and by no means frivolously, demand some of his thoughts 
-and much of his money. To the station of a young aspirant of fashion in 
the polite world, who is known not to be rich, it matters nothing what 
e pays for his lodging : he can always give his address at a club or hotel. 
No one cares how much or how little he pays for his dinner. No fine 
lady inquires if he calls at her house on foot or in a carriage. But society 
expects him to dress as much like a gentleman as if he were a young 
duke : and, fortunately, as young dukes nowadays do not wear gold lace 
and miniver, this is no unreasonable exaction on the part of society. A 
gentleman's taste in dress is, upon principle, the avoidance of all things 
rtravagant. It consists in the quiet simplicity of exquisite neatness ; 
but as the neatness must be a neatness in fashion, employ the best tailor ; 
pay him ready money, and, on the whole, you will find him the cheapest.' 
ill, if a young man of the gay world means to do the best that he can 
for his person, and really does obtain a certain rank or repute should it be

only said of him that he is extremely well dressed, he will remember that 
no man in great capitals, without pre-eminent claims of fortune, birth, or 
beauty, ever really finds a place in haul ton without some cultivation of 
mind. All the men I have ever known who have lifted themselves into 
authority in the inner circles of fashion have been men of considerable in- 
tellectual accomplishment. They have either had wit or humour to a fine 
decree, or admirably strong sense and judgment, or keen penetration into 
character ; they have been, from qualities far below the surface, either

HE leading conditions essential to health may be thus enu- 
merated : 1. A constant supply of pure air ; 2. A suffi- 
ciency of nourishing food, rightly taken ; 3. Cleanliness ; 
4. A sufficiency of exercise to the various organs of the 
system; 5. A right temperature ; 6. A sufficiency of cheer- 
ful and innocent enjoyments; and, 7. Exemption from 
harassing cares. 

AIE. 

The common air is a fluid composed mainly of two gases, in certain 

roportions ; namely, oxygen as twenty and nitrogen as eighty parts in a 

hundred, with a very minute addition of carbonic acid gas. Such is 

air in its pure and right state, and such is the state in which we require it 

for respiration. When it is loaded with any admixture of a different kind 

B natural proportions are in any way deranged, it cannot be breathed 

without producing injurious results. We also require what is apt to appear 

irge quantity of this element of healthy existence. The lunge of a 

healthy full-grown man, will inhale the bulk of twenty cubic inches at 

every inspiration, and he will use no less than fifty-seven hogsheads in 

twenty-four hours. 

Now, there are various circumstances which tend to surround us at 

fames with vitiated air, and which must accordingly be guarded against. 

calling for attention is the miasma or noxious quality imparted 



100 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

to the air in certain districts by stagnant water and decayed vegetable 
matter. It is now generally acknowledged that this noxious quality is in 
reality a subtle poison, which acts on the human system through the 
medium of the lungs, producing fevers and other epidemics. 

Putrid matter of all kinds is another conspicuous source of noxious 
effluvia. The filth collected in ill-regulated towns ill-managed drains- 
collections of decaying animal substances, placed too near or within private 

dwellino-s are notable for their effects in vitiating the atmosphere, and 

generating disease in those exposed to them. In this case also, it is a 
poison diffused abroad through the air which acts so injuriously on the 
human frame. 

The human subject tends to vitiate the atmosphere for itself, by the 
effect which it produces on the air which it breathes. Our breath, when 
we draw it in, consists of the ingredients formerly mentioned ; but it is 
in a very different state when we part with it. On passing into our lungs 
the oxygen, forming the lesser ingredient, enters into combination with 
the carbon of the venous blood (or blood which has already performed it.s 
round through the body) ; in this process about two-fifths of the oxygen 
is abstracted and sent into the blood, only the remaining three-fifths being 
expired, along with the nitrogen nearly as it was before. In place of the 
oxygen consumed, there is expired an equal volume of carbonic acid gas, 
such gas being a result of the process of combination just alluded to. Now, 
carbonic acid gas, in a larger proportion than that in which it is found in 
the atmosphere, is noxious. The volume of it expired by the lungs, if free 
to mingle with the air at large, will do no harm ; but, if breathed out into 
a close room, it will render the air unfit for being again breathed. Sup- 
pose an individual to be shut up in an air-tight box: each breath he emits 
throws a certain quantity of carbonic acid gas into the air filling the box; 
the air is thus vitiated, and every successive inspiration is composed of 
worse and worse materials, till at length the oxygen is so much exhausted 
that it is insufficient for the support of life. He would then be sensible of 
a great difficulty in breathing, and in a little time longer he would die. 

Most rooms in which human beings live are not strictly close. The 
i-himney and the chinks of the doors and windows generally allow of a 
communication to a certain extent with the outer air, so that it rarely 
happens that great immediate inconvenience is experienced in ordinary 
apartments from want of fresh air. But it is at the same time quite cer- 
tain that, in all ordinary apartments where human beings are assembled, 
the air unavoidably becomes considerably vitiated, for in such a situation 
there cannot be a sufficiently ready copious supply of oxygen to make up 



FOOD. 10 1 

for that which has been consumed, and the carboiiic acid gas will be con- 
stantly accumulating. This is particularly the case in bed-rooms, and in 
theatres, churches, and schools. 

Perhaps it is in bed-rooms that the most harm is done. These are gene- 
rally smaller than other rooms, and they are usually kept close during the 
whole night. The result of sleeping in such a room is very injurious. A 
common fire, from the draught which it produces, is very serviceable in 
ventilating rooms, but it is at best a defective means of doing so. The 
draught which it creates generally sweeps along near the floor between the 
door and the fire, leaving all above the level of the chimney-piece unpu- 
rifa'ed. Yet scarcely any other arrangement is anywhere made for the pur- 
pose of changing the air in ordinary rooms. 

FOOD. 

The second requisite for the preservation of health is a sufficiency of 
nutritious food. 

Organic bodies, in which are included vegetables as well as animals, are 
constituted upon the principle of a continual waste of substance supplied 
by continual nutrition. 

The Nutritive System of animals, from apparently the humblest of these 
to the highest, comprehends an alimentary tube or cavity, into which food 
is received, and from which, after undergoing certain changes, it is diffused 
by means of smaller vessels throughout the whole structure. In the form 
of this tube, and in the other apparatus connected with the taking of food, 
there are, in different animals, varieties of structure, all of which are res- 
pectively in conformity with peculiarities in the quality and amount of 
food which the particular animals are designed to take. The harmony to 
be observed in these arrangements is remarkably significant of that Crea- 
tive design to be traced in all things. 

MAX DESIGNED TO LIVE ON A MIXED DIET. Some animals are formed 
to live upon vegetable substances alone; others are calculated to live upon 
the flesh of other animals. Herbivorous animals, as the former are called, 
have generally a long and complicated alimentary tube, because the nutri- 
tious .part of such food, being comparatively small in proportion to the 
whole bulk, requires a greater space in which to be extracted and absorbed 
into the system. The sheep, for example, has a series of intestines, twemy- 
seven times the length of its body. For the opposite reasons carnivorous 
or flesh-devouring animals, as the feline tribe of quadrupeds, and the rapa- 
cious birds, have generally a short intestinal canal. The former class of 



102 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA.. 

animals are furnished with teeth calculated by their broad and flat sur- 
faces, as well as by the lateral movement of the jaws in which they are set, 
to mince down the herbage and grain eaten by them. But the carnivorous 
animals, with wide-opening jaws, have long and sharp fangs to seize and 
tear their prey. These peculiarities of structure mark sufficiently the 
designs of nature with respect to the kinds of food required by the two 
different classes of animals for their support. 

The human intestinal canal being of medium length, and the human 
teeth being a mixture of two kinds, it necessarily follows that man 
was designed to eat both vegetable and animal food. As no animal can 
live agreeably or healthy except in conformity with the laws of its consti- 
tution, it follows that man will not thrive unless with a mixture of animal 
and vegetable food. The followers of Pythagoras argued, from the cruelty 
of putting animals to death, that it was proper to live on vegetables alone, 
and many eccentric persons of modern times have acted upon this rule. 
But the ordinances of Nature speak a different language; and, if we have 
any faith in these, we cannot for a moment doubt that a mixture of animal 
food is necessary for our well-being. On the other hand, we cannot dis- 
pense with vegetable food, without injurious consequences. In that case 
we place in a medium alimentary canal, a kind of food which is calculated 
for a short one, thus violating an arrangement of the most important 
nature. A balance between the two kinds of food is what we should 
observe, if we would desire to live a natural and consequently healthy 
life. 

KULES CONNECTED WITH EATING. In order fully to understand how to 
eat, what to eat, and how to conduct ourselves after eating, it is necessary 
that we should be acquainted in some measure with the process of nutri- 
tion that curious series of operations by which food is received and assi- 
milated by our system in order to make good the deficiency produced by 
waste. 

Food is first received into the mouth, and there the operations in ques- 
tion may be said to commence. It is there to be chewed (or masticated), 
and mixed with saliva, preparatory to its being swallowed or sent into the 
stomach. Even in this introductory stage, there are certain rules to be 
observed. Strange as it may appear, to know how to eat is a matter of 
very considerable importance. 

Many persons, thinking it all a matter of indifference, or perhaps unduly 
anxious to dispatch their meals, eat very fast. They tumble their meat 
precipitately into their mouths, and swallow it almost without masti- 



FOOD. 103 

cation. This is contrary to an express law of nature, as may be easily 
shown. 

Food, on being received into the mouth, has two processes to undergo, 
both very necessary to digestion. It has to be masticated, or chewed down, 
and also to receive an admixture of saliva. The saliva is a fluid arising 
from certain glands in and near the mouth, and approaching in character 
to the gastric juice afterward to be described. Unless food be well broken 
down or masticated, and also well mixed up with the salivary fluid, it will 
be difficult of digestion. The stomach is then called upon to do, beside its 
own proper duty, that which properly belongs to the teeth and saliva, and 
it is thus overburdened and embarrassed, often in a very serious manner. 
The pains of indigestion are the immediate consequence, and more remote 
injuries follow. 

It is therefore to be concluded that a deliberate mastication of our food 
is conducive to health, and that fast eating is injurious, and sometimes 
even dangerou*. 

The food, having been properly masticated, is, by the action of the 
tongue, thrown into the gullet. It then descends into the stomach, not so 
much by its own gravity, as by its being urged along by the contractions 
and motions of the gullet itself. The stomach may be considered as n 
expansion of the gullet, and the chief part of the alimentary canal. It is, 
in fact, a membranous pouch or bag, very similar in shape to a bagpipe, 
having two openings, the one by which the food enters, the other that by 
which it passes out. It is into the greater curvature of the bag that the 
gullet enters ; it is at its lesser that it opens into that adjoining portion of 
the canal into which the half-digested mass is next propelled. 

When food has been introduced, the two orifices close, and that which 
we may term the second stage in the process of digestion commences. The 
mass, already saturated with saliva, and so broken down as to expose all 
its particles to the action of the gastric juice, is now submitted to the action 
of that fluid, which, during digestion, is freely secreted by the vessels of the 
stomach. The most remarkable quality of this juic*e is its solvent power, 
which is prodigious. 

The food exposed to this dissolving agency is converted into a soft, grey, 
pulpy mass, called chyme, which, by the muscular contraction of the 
stomach, is urged on into the adjoining part of the alimentary canal, called 
the duodenum. This is generally completed in the space of from half an 
hour to two or three hours ; the period varying according to flhe nature 
and volume of the food taken, and the mastication and insalivation it has 
undergone. 



104. THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

In the duodenum, the chyme becomes intimately mixed and incorporated 
with the bile and pancreatic juice ; also with a fluid secreted by the mu- 
cous follicles of the intestine itself. The bile is a greenish, bitter, and 
somewhat viscid fluid, secreted by the liver, which occupies a considerable 
space on the right side of the body, immediately under the ribs. From this 
organ the bile, after a portion of it has passed up into the adjacent gall- 
bladder, descends through a small duct, about the size of a goose-quill, into 
the duodenum. The chyme, when mixed with these fluids, undergoes a 
change in its appearance ; it assumes a yellow colour and bitter taste, 
owing to the predominance of the bile in the mass ; but its character varies 
according to the nature of the food that has been taken. Fatty matters, 
tendons, cartilages, white of eggs, etc., are not so readily converted into 
chyme as fibrous or fleshy, cheesy, and glutinous substances. The chyme, 
having undergone the changes adverted to, is urged by the peristaltic mo- 
tion of the intestines onward through the alimentary canal. This curious 
motion of the intestines is caused by the contraction of the muscular coat 
which enters into their structure, and one of the principal uses ascribed to 
the bile is that of stimulating them to this motion. If the peristaltic motion 
be diminished, owing to a deficiency of bile, then the progress of digestion is 
retarded, and the body becomes constipated. In such cases, calomel, the 
blue pill, and other medicines, are administered for the purpose of stimu- 
lating the liver to secrete the biliary fluid that it may quicken by its stim- 
ulating properties the peristaltic action. But this is not the only use of 
the bile : it also assists in separating the nutritious from the non-nutritious 
portion of the alimentary mass, for the chyme now presents a mixture of 
a fluid termed chyle, which is in reality the nutritious portion eliminated 
from the food. The chyme thus mixed with chyle arrives in the small in- 
testines, on the walls of which a series of exquisitely delicate vessels ram- 
ify in every direction. These vessels absorb or take up the chyle, leaving 
the rest of the mass to be ejected from the body. The chyle, thus taken 
up, is carried into little bodies of glands, where it is still further elaborated, 
acquiring additional nutritious properties ; after which, corresponding ves- 
sels, emerging from these glands, carry along the fluid to a comparatively 
large vessel, called the thoracic duct, which ascends in the abdomen along 
the side of the back-bone, and pours it into that side of the heart to which 
the blood that has already circulated through the body returns. Here the 
chyle is intimately mixed with the blood, which fluid is now propelled 
into the lungs, where it undergoes, from being exposed to the action of the 
air we breathe, the changes necessary to render it again fit for circulation. 
It is in the lungs, therefore, that the process of digestion is completed ; the 



FOOD. 105 

blood has now acquired those nutrient properties from which it secretes 
the new particles of matter adapted to supply the waste of the different 
textures of the body. 

When food is received into the stomach, the secretion of the gastric 
juice immediately commences ; and when a full meal has been taken, this 
secretion generally lasts for about an hour. It is a law of vital action, that 
when any living organ is called into play, there is immediately an increased 
flow of blood and nervous energy toward it. The stomach, while secreting 
its fluid, displays this phenomenon, and the consequence is, that the blood 
and nervous energy are called away from other organs. This is the cause 
of that chilliness at the extremities which we often feel after eating heartily. 
So great is the demand which the stomach thus makes upon the rest of 
the system, that, during and for some time after a meal, we are not in a 
condition to take strong exercise of any kind. Both body and mind are 
inactive and languid. They are so, simply because that which supports 
muscular and mental actisdty is concentrated for the time upon the organs 
of digestion. This is an arrangement of nature which a regard to health 
requires that we should not interfere with. We should indulge in the mus- 
cular and mental repose which is demanded: and this should last for not 
much less than an hour after every meal. In that time the secretion of gas- 
tric juice is nearly finished ; the new nutriment begins to tell upon the 
general circulation ; and we are again fit for active exertion. The conse- 
sequence of not observing this rule is very hurtful. Strong exercise, or 
mental application during or immediately after a meal, diverts the flow 
of nervous energy and of blood to the stomach, and the process of diges- 
tion is necessarily retarded or stopped. Confusion is thus introduced into 
the system, and a tendency to the terrible calamity of dyspepsia is 
perhaps established. 

For the same reason that repose is required after a meal, it is necessary, 
in some measure, for a little while before. At the moment when we have 
concluded a severe muscular task, such, for example, as a long walk, the flow 
of nervous energy and of circulation is strongly directed to the muscular 
system. It requires some time to allow this flow to stop and subside ; and 
till this takes place, it is not proper to bring the stomach into exercise, as 
the demand it makes when filled would not in that case be answered. Just 
so if we be engaged in close mental application, the nervous energy and 
circulation being in that case directed to the brain, it is not right all at 
once to call another and distant organ into play ; some time is required to 
allow of the energy and circulation being prepared to take the new direc- 
tion. It maj', therefore, be laid down as a maxim, that, a short, period of 



106 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

repose, or at least of very light occupation, should be allowed before every 
meal. 

KIXDS OF FOOD. It has been shown by a reference to the structure of 
the human intestinal canal, that our food is designed to be a mixture of 
animal and and vegetable substances. 

Inquiries with respect to the comparative digestibility of different kinds 
of food, are perhaps chiefly of consequence to those in whom health has 
already been lost. To the sound and healthy it is comparatively of little 
consequence what kind of food is taken, provided that some variation is 
observed, and no excess committed as to quantity. Within the range of 
fish, flesh, and fowl, there is ample scope for a safe choice. There is 
scarcely any of the familiar aliments of these kinds, but, if plainly dressed, 
will digest in from two to four hours, and prove perfectly healthy. One 
rule alone has been pretty well ascertained, with respect to animal foods, 
that they are the more digestible the more minute and tender the fibre 
may be. They contain more nutriment in a given bulk than vegetable 
matters, and hence their less need for length of intestine to digest them. 
Yet it is worthy of notice, that between the chyle produced from animal 
and that from vegetable food, no essential distinction can be observed. 

Tendon, suet, and oily matters in general, are considerably less digest- 
ible than the ordinary fibre ; and these are aliments which should be 
taken sparingly. Pickling, from its effects in hardening the fibre, dimin- 
ishes the digestibility of meat. Dressed shell-fish, cheese, and some other 
animal foods, are avoided by many as not sufficiently digestible. 

Farinaceous foods of all kinds wheat, oaten, and barley bread, oaten 
porrage, sago, arrow-root, tapioca, and potatoes are highly suitable to the 
human constitution. They generally require under two hours for diges- 
tion, or about half the time of a full mixed meal. The cottage children of 
Scotland, reared exclusively upon oaten porridge and bread, with potatoes 
and milk, may be cited as a remarkable example of a class of human beings 
possessing in an uncommon degree the blessing of health. Green vegeta- 
bles and fruit, however softened by dressing, are less digestible, and less 
healthy as a diet. One important consideration here occurs. There is 
need for a certain bulk in our ordinary food. Receiving nutriment in a 
condensed form and in a small space will not serve the purpose. This is 
1 ecause the organs of digestion are calculated for receiving our food nearly 
in the condition in which nature presents it, namely, in a considerable 
hulk with regard to its nutritions properties. 

QUANTITY OF FOOD. NUMBER AND TIMES OF MEALS. With respect to 
the amount of food necessary for health, it is difficult to lay down any rule. 



FOOD. 107 

as different quantities are safe with different individuals, according to their 
sex, age, activity of life, and some other conditions. 

The number and times of meals are other questions as yet undeter- 
mined. As the digestion of a meal rarely requires more than four hours, 
and the waking part of a day is about sixteen, it seems unavoidable that 
at least three meals be taken, though it may be proper that one, if not two 
of these, be comparatively of a light nature. Breakfast, dinner, and tea 
as a light meal, may be considered as a safe, if not a very accurate, pre- 
scription for the daily food of a healthy person. Certainly four good meala 
a day is too much. 

The interval between rising and breakfast ought not to be great, and 
no severe exercise or task-work of any kind should be undergone during 
this interval. There is a general prepossession to the contrary, arising 
probably from the feeling of freedom and lightness which most people feel 
at that period of the day, and which seems to them as indicating a prepar- 
edness for exertion. But this feeling, perhaps, only arises from a sense of 
relief from that oppression of food under which much of the rest of the day is 
spent. It is quite inconsistent with all we know of the physiology of ali- 
ment, to suppose that the body is capable of much exertion when the sto- 
mach has been for several hours quite empty. We have known many per- 
sons take long walks before breakfast, under an impression that they were 
doing something extremely favourable to health. Others we have known 
go through three hours of mental taskwork at the same period, believing 
that they were gaining so much time. But the only observable result was 
to subtract from the powers of exertion in the middle and latter part of 
the day. In so far as the practice was contrary to nature, it would like- 
wise of course produce permanent injury. Only a short saunter in the 
open air, or a very brief application to business or task-work, can be safely 
indulged in before breakfast. 

With regard to the time for either breakfast or dinner, nothing can be 
said with scientific authority. 

VARIETY OF FOOD. A judicious variation of food is not only useful, but 
important. There are, it is true, some aliments, such as bread, which can- 
not be varied, and which no one ever wishes to be so. But apart from 
one or two articles, a certain variation of rotation is much to be desired, 
and will prove favourable to health. There is a common prepossession re- 
specting one dish, which is more spoken of than acted upon. In reality, 
there is no virtue in this practice, excepting that, if rigidly adhered to, it 
makes excess nearly impossible, no one being able to eat to satiety of one 
kind of food. There would be a benefit from both a daily variation of 



108 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

food and eating of more than one dish at a meal, if moderation were in 
both cases to be strictly observed, for the relish to be thus obtained is use- 
ful as promotive of the flow of nervous energy to the stomach, exactly in 
the same manner as cheerfulness is useful. The policy which would make 
food in any way unpleasant to the taste, is a most mistaken one ; for to eat 
with languor, or against inclination, or with any degree of disgust, is to 
lose much of the benefit of eating. On the other hand, to cook dishes 
highly, and provoke appetite by artificial means, are equally reprehensi- 
ble. Propriety lies in the mean between the two extremes. 

BEVERAGES. The body containing a vast amount of fluids, which are 
undergoing a perpetual waste, there is a necessity for an occasional supply 
of liquor of some kind, as well as of solid food. It remains to be considered 
what is required in the character or nature of this liquor, to make it serve 
the end consistently with the preservation of health. 

When the digestion is good and the system in full vigour, the bodily 
energy is easily sustained by nutritious food, and " artificial stimulent only 
increases the wasting of the natural strength." Nearly all physicians, in- 
deed, concur in representing ardent liquors as unfavourable to the health 
of the healthy, and as being in their excess highly injurious. Even the 
specious defence which has been set up for their use, on the ground that 
they would not have been given to man if they had not been designed for 
general use, has been shown to be ill-founded, seeing that vinous fermenta- 
tion, from which they are derived, is not a healthy condition of vegetable 
matter, but a stage in its progress of decay. Upon the whole, there can 
be little doubt that these liquors are deleterious in our ordinary healthy 
condition ; and that simple water, toast water, whey, ginger beer, or lemon- 
ade, would be preferable (the first being the most natural and the best of 
all), if we could only consent to deny ourselves further indulgence. 

CLEANLINESS. 

To keep the body in a cleanly condition is the third important requisite 
for health. This becomes necessary in consequence of a very important 
process which is constantly going on near and upon the surface of the body. 

The process in question is that of perspiration. The matter here con- 
cerned is a watery secretion produced by glands near the surface of the 
body, and sent up through the skin by channels imperceptibly minute and 
wonderfully numerous. From one to two pounds of this secretion is 
believed to exude through these channels or pores in the course of 
twenty-four hours, being in fact the chief form taken by what is called the 



CLEANLINESS. 109 

waste of the system, the remainder passing off b}- the bowels, kidneys, and 
lungs. To promote the egress of this rluid is of great consequence to 
health ; for when it is suppressed, disease is apt to fall upon some of the 
other organs concerned in the discharge of waste. 

One of the most notable checks which perspiration experiences is that 
produced by a current of cold air upon the skin, in which case the pores 
instantly contract and close, and the individual is seized with some ailment 
either in one of the other organs of waste, whichever is in him the weak- 
est, or in the internal lining of some part of the body, all of which is sym- 
pathetic with the condition of the skin. A result of the nature of that 
last described is usually recognised as a cold or catarrh. We are not at 
present called on particularly to notice such effects of checked perspiration, 
but others of a less immediately hurtful or dangerous nature. 

The fluid alluded to is composed, besides water, of certain salts and ani- 
mal matters, which, being solid, do not pass away in vapour, as does the 
watery part of the compound, but rest on the surface where they have 
been discharged. There, if not removed by some artificial means, thev 
form a layer of hard stuff, and unavoidably impede the egress of the cur- 
rent perspiration. By cleanliness is merely meant the taking proper means 
to prevent this or any other matter accumulating on the surface, to the 
production of certain hurtful consequences. 

Ablution or washing is the best means of attaining this end ; and ac- 
cordingly it is well for us to wash or bathe the body very frequently. 
Many leave by far the greater part of their bodies unwashed, except, per- 
haps, on rare occasions, thinking it enough if the parts exposed to common 
view be in decent trim. If the object of cleaning were solely to preserve 
fair appearances, this might be sufficient ; but the great end, it must be 
clearly seen, is to keep the skin in a fit state for its peculiar and very im- 
portant functions. Frequent change of the clothing next to the skin is of 
course a great aid to cleanliness, and may partly be esteemed as a substi- 
tute for bathing, seeing that the clothes absorb much of the impurities, 
and, when changed, may be said to carry these off. But still this will not 
serve the end nearly so well as frequent ablution of the whole person. 
Any one will be convinced of this, who goes into a bath, and uses the flesh- 
brush in cleansing his body. The quantity of scurf and impurity which 
he will then remove, from even a body which has changes of linen once a 
day, will surprise him.

EXERCISE. 

The constitution of external nature shows that man was destined for an 
active existence, as, without labour, scarcely any of the gifts of providence 
are to be made available. In perfect harmony with this character of the 
material world, he has been furnished with a muscular and mental system, 
constructed on the principle of being fitted for exertion, and requiring ex- 
ertion for a healthy existence. Formed as he is, it is not possible for him 
to abstain from exertion without very hurtful consequences. 

MUSCULAR EXERCISE. With regard to merely bodily exercise, it is to 
be observed, in the first place, that we have no fewer than four hundred 
muscles, each designed to serve some particular end in locomotion or in 
operating upon external objects. A sound state of body depends very 
much upon each of these muscles being brought into action in proper cir- 
cumstances and to a suitable extent. There is even a law operating within 
a certain range, by which each muscle will gain in strength and soundness 
by being brought into a proper degree of activity. 

The process of waste and renovation may be said to be always going on 
in the body, but it does not go on with permanent steadiness unless the 
muscular system be exercised. Whenever one of the organs is put into 
exertion, this process becomes active, and the two operations of which it 
consists maintain a due proportion to each other. A greater flow of blood 
and of nervous energy is sent to the organ, and this continues as long as 
it is kept in activity. When one state of action follows close upon ano- 
ther, the renovating part of the process rather exceeds the waste, and an 
accretion of new substance, as well as an addition of fresh power takes 
place. On the contrary, when an organ is little exercised, the process of 
renovation goes on languidly, and to a less extent than that of waste, and 
the parts consequently become flabby, shrunken, and weak. Even the 
bones are subject to the same laws. If these be duly exercised in their 
business of administering to motion, the vessels which pervade them are 
fed more actively with blood, and they increase in dimensions, solidity, 
and strength. If they be little exercised, the stimulus required for the 
supply of blood to them becomes insufficient ; imperfect nutrition takes 
place ; and the consequences are debility, softness, and unfitness for their 
office. Bones may be so much softened by inaction, as to become suscep- 
tible of being cut by a knife. In a less degree, the same cause will pro- 
duce languor and bad health. 

It is of the utmost importance to observe, that the exercise of any par- 
ticular limb does little besides improving the strength of that limb ; and 



EXERCISE. 

that, in order to increase our general strength, the whole frame must be 
brought into exercise. 

In order, then, to maintain in a sound state the energies which nature 
has given us, and still more particularly, to increase their amount, we must 
exercise them. If we desire to have a strong limb, we must exercise that 
limb ; if we desire that the whole of our frame should be sound and strong, 
we must exercise the whole of our frame. It is mainly by these means 
that health and strength are to be preserved and improved. There are 
rules, however, for the application of these laws of our being. 

1. In order that exercise may be truly advantageous, the parts must be 
in a state of sufficient health to endure the exertion. In no case must ex- 
ercise be carried beyond what the parts are capable of bearing with ease ; 
otherwise a loss of energy, instead of a gain, will be the consequence. 

2. Exercise, to be efficacious, even in a healthy subject, must be excited, 
sustained, and directed by that nervous stimulus which gives the muscles 
the principal part of their strength, and contributes so much to the nutri- 
tion of parts in a state of activity. 

3. The waste occasioned by exercise must be duly replaced by food ; as, 
if there be any deficiency in thut important requisite, the blood will soon 
cease to give that invigoration to the parts upon which increased health 
and strength depend. 

KINDS OF BODILY EXERCISE. Exercise is usually considered as of two 
kinds active and passive. The active consists in walking, running, leap- 
ing, riding, fencing, rowing, skating, swimming, dancing, and various exer- 
cises, such as those with the poles, ropes, &c., prescribed in gymnastic in- 
stitutions. The passive consists in carriage-riding, sailing, friction, swing- 
ing, &c. 

Walking is perhaps the readiest mode of taking exercise, and the one 
most extensively resorted to. If it brought the upper part of the body as 
thoroughly into exertion as the lower, it would be perfect, for it is gentle 
and safe with nearly all except the much debilitated. To render it the 
more effectual in the upper part of the body it were well to walk at all 
times, when convenient, singly and allow the arms and trunk free play. 
It is best to walk with a companion, or for some definite object, as the 
now of nervous energy will be by these means promoted, and the exercise 
be rendered, as has been already explained, the more serviceable. 

Very long or rapid walks should not be attempted by individuals of 
sedentary habits, nor by weakly persons. Their frames are totally unpre- 
pared for such violent exertion. 



THK HOME, FARM AND I'.USIXKSS CYCLOP. E]>IA. 

Running is &n exercise which is intermediate between walking and 
leaping ; it consists, in fact, of a series of leaps performed in progression 
from one foot to another, and the degree of its rapidity bears a constant 
proportion to the length of the individual and successive leaps. Although 
this and other gymnastic exercises, such as leaping, wrestling, throwing 
heavy weights, etc., may, when judiciously had recourse to, invigorate the 
body, yet, from apprehension of the evils and accidents which may be so 
occasioned, young persons ought not to be permitted to engage extensively 
in such exercises, except under the care of some one well acquainted with 
gymnastics. 

Fencing is of all active exercises that which is the most commendable, 
inasmuch as it throws open the chest, and at the same time calls into ac- 
tion the muscles both of the upper and lower extremities. Add to this, 
that it improves very much the carriage of the body ; for which reason it 
may be reckoned a branch of polite education. 

Dancing is exhilarating and healthful, and seems to be almost the only 
active exercise which the despotic laws of fashion permit young ladies to 
enjoy. 

Riding is generally classed among the passive exercises, but in reality 
it is one which involves much action of the whole frame, and as such is 
very useful for health. Pursued solitarily, it has the drawback of being 
somewhat dull ; but, when two or three ride in company, a sufficient flow 
of the nervous energy may be obtained. 

The amount of bodily exercise which should be taken must rary accord- 
ing to the habits, strength, and general health of the individual. It was 
an aphorism of Boerhaave, that every person should take at least two 
hours' exercise in the day, and this may be regarded as a good general 
rule. 

MENTAL EXERCISE. Having thus explained the laws and regulations 
by which exercise may be serviceable to the physical system, we shall pro- 
ceed to show that the same rules hold good respecting the mental facul- 
ties. These, as is generally allowed, however immaterial in one sense, are 
connected organically with the brain a portion of the animal system 
nourished by the same blood, and regulated by the same vital laws, as the 
muscles, bones, and nerves. As, by disuse, muscle becomes emaciated, 
bone softens, blood-vessels are obliterated, and nerves lose their natural 
structure, so, by, disuse, does the brain fall out of its proper state, and 
create misery to its possessor ; and as, by over-exertion, the waste of the 
animal system exceeds the supply, and debility and unsoundness are pro- 
duced, so, by over-exertion, are the functions of the brain liable to be de-

ranged and destroyed. The processes are physiologically the same, and the 
effects bear an exact relation to each other. As with the bodily powers 
the mental are to be increased in magnitude and energy by a decree of 
I'Xt'i-cise measured with a just regard to their ordinary health and native 
or habitual energies. Corresponding, moreover, to the influence which the 
mind has in giving the nervous stimulus so useful in bodily exercise, is the 
dependence of the mind upon the body for supplies of healthy nutriment. 
And, in like manner with the bodily functions, each mental faculty is only 
to be strengthened by the exercise of itself in particular. 

It ought to be universally known, that the uses of our intellectual na- 
ture are not to be property realized without a just regard to the laws of 
that perishable frame with which it is connected ; that, in cultivating the 
mind, we must neither overtask nor undertask the body, neither push it 
to too great a speed, nor leave it neglected ; and that, notwithstanding this 
intimate connection and mutual dependence, the highest merits on the part 
of the mind will not compensate for muscles mistreated, or soothe a nervous 
system which severe study has tortured into insanity. To come to detail, 
it ought to be impressed on all, that to spend more than a moderate num- 
ber of hours in mental exercise diminishes insensibly the powers of future 
application, and tends to abbreviate life ; that no mental exercise should 
be attempted immediately after meals, as the processes of thought and of 
digestion cannot be safely prosecuted together ; and that, without a due 
share of exercise to the whole of the mental faculties, there can be no 
soundness in any, while the whole corporeal system will give way beneath 
a severe pressure upon any one in particular. These are truths completely 
established with physiologists, and upon which it is undeniable that a 
great portion of human happiness depends. 

REPOSE, A CONDITION DEMANDED BY EXERCISE. Exercise demands oc- 
casional periods of repose, and, in particular, that a certain part of every 
twenty-four hours be spent in sleep, After having been engaged in daily 
occupations for fourteen or sixteen hours, a general feeling of fatigue and 
weakness is induced ; the motions of the body become difficult, and senses 
confused, the power of volition or will suspended, and the rest of the 
mental faculties, becoming more and more inactive, sink at length into a 
state of unconsciousness. The sense of sight first ceases to act by the 
closing of the eyelids; then the senses of taste and smell become 
dormant ; and then those of hearing and touch. The muscles, also, dis- 
pose themselves with a certain reference to ease of position, those of the 
limbs having grown indolent before those that support the head, and 
those that support the head before those of the trunk. In proportion as 



U4 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

these phenomena proceed, the respiration becomes slower and more deep, 
the circulation diminishes in impetus, the blood proceeds in great quantity 
towards the head, and all the functions of the internal organs become 
retarded. In this state, shut out as it were from the external world, 
the mind still retains its wonted activity, deprived, however, of the guid- 
ance of judgment and the power of distinct recollection ; in consequence 
of which, it does not perceive the monstrous incongruities of the imagery 
which sweeps before it, and takes but faint cognizance of the time which 

elapses. 

It may be laid down as an axiom, that the more uninterrupted sleep is, 
the more refreshing and salutary will be its effects ; for during this period 
the body undoubtedly acquires an accession of nervous energy, which 
restlessness, however induced, must disturb ; and therefore the state of 
the body before going to sleep, the kind of bed, and the manner of cloth- 
ing require especial attention. As the functions of the body are performed 
more slowly during our sleeping than our waking hours, a full meal or 
supper, taken immediately before going to bed, imposes a load on the 
stomach which it is not in a condition to digest, and the unpleasant con- 
sequence of oppressive and harassing dreams is almost certain to ensue. 
When the sleeper lies on his back, the heart pressing, while pulsating, on 
the lungs, gives rise to a sense of intolerable oppression on the chest, 
which seems to bear down upon the whole body, so that in this painful 
state not a muscle will obey the impulse of the will, and every effort to 
move appears to be altogether unavailing. This constitutes incubus or 
nightmare : and it may be observed, that, as acidity on the stomach, or 
indigestion gives rise to such dreams, so all dreams of this disturbed char- 
acter are converse indications of indigestion ; for which reason the great 
physiologist Haller considered dreaming to be a symptom of disease. 

The kind of bed on which we repose requires attention. Some are 
advocates for soft, others for hard beds ; hence some accustom themselves 
to feather-beds, others to mattresses. The only difference between a soft 
and hard bed is this that the weight of the body in a soft bed presses on a 
larger surface than on a hard bed, and thereby a greater degree of comfort 
is enjoyed. Parents err in fancying that a very hard bed contributes to 
harden the constitution of their children ; for which reason they lay them 
down on mattresses, or beds with boarded bottoms. A bed for young 
children cannot be too soft, provided the child does not sink into it in 
such a manner that the surrounding parts of the bed bend over and cover 
the body. The too great hardness of beds, says Dr. Durwin, frequently 
proves injurious to the shape of infants, by causing them to rest on too 



TEMPERATURE. H5 

few parts at a time ; it also causes their sleep to be uneasy and unrefresh- 
ing. Whatever be the time chosen for sleep, it is evident that no person 
can with impunity convert day into night. Eight o'clock for children 
and eleven for adults, may be recommended as good hours for retiring to 
rest. It is well known that children require more sleep than adults ; and 
more sleep is requisite in winter than in summer. The average duration 
of sleep which may be recommended for adults is eight hours ; but much 
depends upon habit, and many persons require only six. It is scarcely 
necessary to observe, that, on rising in the morning, the strictest attention 
should be paid to washing the face, neck and hands ; the mouth and teeth 
should also be well cleansed. The most simple powder for the teeth is 
finely brayed charcoal, a little of which will clear away all impurities, and 
preserve the teeth. On leaving the bedroom, the windows should be 
opened, and the clothes of the bed turned down, it order that the exhala- 
tions of the body during sleep may be dissipated. If, instead of this, the 
bed be made immediately after we have risen, these exhalations are again 
folded up with the clothes a practice which is not consonant either witli 
cleanliness or with health. 

TEMPEKATUKE. 

The fifth important requisite for health is that the body be kept in a 
temperature suitable to it. 

The degree of heat indicated by sixty degrees of Fahrenheit's ther- 
mometer, or that of a temperate summer day, is what the human bodv 
finds it agreeable to be exposed to when in a state of inactivity. 

There is no period of life at which warmth is of more consequence than 
in infancy. In a very young babe, the circulation is almost altogether 
confined to the surface, the internal organs being as yet in a very weak 
state. In such circumstance, to plunge the child into cold water, from an 
idea of making it hardy, as is customary in some countries, and among 
ignorant persons in our own, is the height of cruelty and folly ; for the 
unavoidable consequence is, that the blood is thrown in upon the internal 
organs, and inflammation, bowel-complaints, croup, or convulsions, are 
very apt to ensue. A baby requires to be kept at a temperature above 
what is suitable to a grown person ; it should be warmly, but not heavilv 
clothed ; the room where it is kept should be maintained at a good, but 
not oppressive heat ; and it should never be put into other than tepid 
water. It should not be exposed to the open air for some days after its 
birth. 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

At all periods of life it is most desirable to avoid exposure to very low 
temperatures, especially for any considerable length of time. To sit long 
in cold school-rooms, or work-rooms, with the whole body, and especially 
the feet, in a chilled condition, is very unfavourable to the health of 
young people. 

Clothing should be in proportion to the temperature of the climate and 
the season of the year ; and where there are such abrupt transitions from 
heat to cold as in our country, it is not safe ever to go very thinly clad, 
as we may in that case be exposed to a sudden chill before we can effect 
the proper change of dress. Very fatal effects often result to ladies from 
incautiously stepping out of heated rooms in the imperfect clothing which 
they ludicrously style full-dress ; all such injuries might be avoided by 
putting on a sufficiency of shawls, and allowing themselves a little time- 
in the lobby to cool. The under-clothing in this country should be in- 
variably of flannel, which is remarkably well calculated to preserve uni- 
formity of temperature, as well as to produce a healthy irritation in the 
skin. 

Wet clothes applied to any part of the body, when it is in an inactive 
state, have an instantaneous effect in reducing the temperature, this being 
an unavoidable effect of the process of evaporation which then takes 
place. Hence it is extremely dangerous to sit upon damp ground, or to 
remain at rest a single minute with wetted feet, or any other part 
of the body invested in damp garments. Dampness in the house in 
which we live has the same effect, and is equally dangerous.' The 
chill produced by evaporation from the wetted surface checks the 
perspiration, and sends the blood inward to the vital parts, where it- 
tends to produce inflammatory disease. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 

The fundamental principle of all efforts to improve and preserve health 
has been thus stated : " Man, as an organized being, is subject to organic 
laws, as much a^ the inanimate bodies which surround him are to laws 
mechanical and chemical ; and we can as little escape the consequences oJ 
neglect or violation of those natural laws, which affect organic life throug? 
the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the exercise we take, as a ston< 
projected from the hand, or a shot from the mouth of a cannon, can plac< 
itself beyond the bounds of gravitation." It may be added, that " al 
human science, all the arts of civilized man, consist of discoveries madt 
by us of the laws impressed upon nature by the Author of the universe 



CHILDREX, AXD HOW TO REAR THEM. 117 

and the applications of those laws to the conditions which are laws also 
in which man and the particular bodies and substances around him are 
placed ; nor, it is manifest, should science concern us more than that 
which relates to the conditions on which organic life is held by each in- 
dividual." 



(thilbrcn, anb Dob to Jlcar <5Ehem. 




T is a well-known fact that some of the greatest blessings we 
enjoy are the least appreciated, and this may be truly said 
of light. We are so accustomed to it that we fail to re- 
member its importance, though did we but recollect that it 
is synonymous with life, we could not fail to be sensible of 
the inestimable value of this essential of our being. 

Deprived of its wholesome and enlivening stimulus, child- 
ren become pale and sickly in appearance, the blood is im- 
perfectly oxygenated, and a proneness to disease or debility 
immediately arises. 

A dark, dull room, or one from which light is more or less excluded, 
should by all means be avoided, for it is injurious alike to the eyes, health 
and spirits of children. But necessary as light is (it is the natural food 
of the eye), it requires regulating according to the age. During early 
infancy the eyes should not be exposed to a concentrated or stron< li-ht ; 
the sun's light should be softened by window blinds, and an infant ought 
never to be held too near a lamp or candle. 

The best arguments in favour of the beneficial effects of light are found 
in the facts that nearly the whole of the vegetable kingdom will cease to 
flourish if deprived of it, and that those children brought up in the dreary 
dark slums of cities, although quite as well fed as those of an agricultural 
labourer, are invariably puny, sickly creatures, without a vestige of colour 
in their cheeks. 

THE PERNICIOUS CUSTOM which obtains so much amongst the lower and 
middle classes in the suburbs of living almost entirely in the basement 
breakfast-room cannot be too strongly condemned, where, as is invariably 
the case, it is dark. The room that is most in use should be " the best 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

room," not on account of the amount of furniture it contains, but owing 
to its being the lightest, and into this room the sun should be allowed to 
freely enter, all ideas of excluding it on account of the carpet being but 
false economy. 

Notwithstanding, however, that a proper amount of light is necessary 
for a child when awake, equal care should be exercised in darkening the , 
room whenjt~(the child) is asleep, as too much light then will not merely 
prevent or interrupt sleep, but may act as a very injurious stimulus to the 
eyes and brain. It goes without saying that the nursery must, of course, 
have plenty of sunlight, and with this view should face the south, east or 
west, but there is another place about which great care should be taken 

the school-room. There is no doubt that the influence of a sunless 

school-room is most baneful to a young mind, and the want of interest in 
their study, often displayed by children, might in many instances be 
traced to this cause. 

BATHING. 

Macbeth's maxim, " If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it 
were done quickly," is especially applicable to the bathing of children. 
There should be no nonsense about it. The object of bathing is not only 
for the purpose of cleanliness but as a means of invigorating the capillary 
circulation, and so fortifying the system as to enable it to resist atmos- 
pheric vicissitudes. 

To do this, however, it is imperative that the child should not remain 
in the bath (presuming it is not warm) more than a minute or two, as 
when the body is immersed in water below ninety degrees there is a sen- 
sation of cold, a shrinking of the skin, and a rush of blood from the small 
capillary vessels of the surface to the internal vessels, which state of ^ 
things should be speedily followed by a reaction by the heart and large ' 
vessels forcing the blood back again to the surface, and indeed to all the 
outlets ; so that the skin glows and perhaps perspires, the secretory organs 
act more strongly, the liver and other organs show an increased activity, 
and there is a general feeling of liveliness and vigour. 

But this will not be the case if there is any dawdling or delay, not only 
while in the water, but during the process of rubbing and drying, which 
must be performed with the greatest briskness, in order that the proper 
reaction, upon which the virtue of the bath depends, should take place : 
otherwise the child will get a chill, which will, in addition to nullifying 
the good, do it absolute harm. 

UP TO THE AGE OF THREE MONTHS infants should, in all weathers, be 
bathed in warm water, but, after that age, at the warm seasons, and dur- 



SLEEP. 119 

inc Summer, cold may be used, provided the child be strong enough, and 
is not frightened, but if the experiment is attended with convulsive 
screaming and great distress, discontinue it and substitute a wanner tem- 
perature. In washing a very young child the head should always be the 
first part damped, and a flannel is preferable for that purpose rather than 
a sponge. 

With regard to all children there are not two opinions on the subject 
of a daily bath given immediately on rising being beneficial, in fact it is 
:\ cine qua non of perfect health, provided, of course, the child is not too 
delicate, and for the elder ones a large sponge is a necessity, as by its use 
a much larger quantity pf oxygen can be introduced into the skin than 
by any other means. 

THE ADDITION OF SEA-SALT is a most desirable adjunct, especially when 
the hips are weak, but even when in good health its occasional use will 
add greatly to the tonic properties of the bath. It should be added 
in such quantity to a bath that the mineral ingredient is equal to that 
contained in salt water ; it will be far more efficacious than a simple fresh 
water bath, as it combines the advantages of temperature with the stimu- 
lating action of the salt upon the skin. 

The advantages of such a bath, taken at the time mentioned, are two- 
fold. It inures the body to a greater degree of cold than it is likely to 
be exposed to during the rest of the day, and so proves most serviceable 
in protecting it from atmospheric influences ; and it tends to remove 
irregularities in the circulation, and, by exciting the healthy action of the 
skin, may aid that organ in removing disease. 

All, however, are not strong enough to stand the shock to the system, 
and not only those who are extremely weak, or who have any organic 
disease, especially the heart or lungs, but there may be some idiosyncrasy 
or condition of the constitution peculiar to the individual which would 
render it impossible. The invariable test is that if after a bath the child 
remains chilly, languid and dejected, or suffers from headache, then it is 
not beneficial, but if the sense of cold rapidly passes off and a glow of 
warmth and animation of spirits succeeds and continues for some time, 
the cold bath cannot fail to be productive of good. 

SLEEP. 

Although much has been written, and rightly so, on the subject of lazi- 
ness, there is as much, if not more, to be said on the necessity of enough 
sleep, for it is as great a necessity as eating and drinking. 



120 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

Infants sleep almost continually, and (in this we know most mothers 
will heartily concur) they cannot sleep too much, owing to the necessity 
for providing the materials for growth. When they are unable to sleep 
for any length of time their condition is unnatural, and shows us that 
they are suffering in some way or other, the cause of which should be 
ascertained and removed ; but not by the use of syrups, elixirs, etc., which 
though they produce slumber, do not produce sleep. 

For young children from twelve to fourteen hours' sleep is necessary, 
and this must be regular; the proper time for bed during the Winter 
months being about six o'clock, and in the Summer months about seven. 
A proper desire for sleep is only obtained by a due amount of exercise, 
both mental and physical, which must not have continued sufficiently 
long to produce prostration. Exercise in moderation is most necessary 
before going to bed, but anything of a violent nature, like romping, 
should be avoided for at least half an hour before. 

WITH REGARD TO THE HOUR at which children and others should rise, 
that must be determined by the time of their waking, and in order to 
wake at a proper time all that is necessary is that you go to bed at some 
regular early hour, and then, says an authority, " within a fortnight 
nature, with almost the regularity of the rising sun, will unloosen the 
bonds of sleep the moment enough repose has been secured for the wants 
of the system." To remain in bed after this, to indulge in that short 
morning doze into which to many allow themselves to fall because it is 
not, they think, quite time to get up, is a baneful practice. 

Care should be taken with regard to the quantity of bed-clothes in- 
dulged in, too much clothing having the effect of relaxing the body, and 
it is right therefore to have only sufficient to enable the individual to 
sleep, for it is better to wake with an inclination to draw the clothes 
round you than so feel oppressed by their weight and heat and a desire 
to throw them off. 

WITH REGARD TO THE PROPER POSITION OF A SLEEPER all are agreed 
that it should be on the right or left side, because if you sleep on your 
back, especially soon after a hearty meal, the weight of the digestive 
organs and that of the food, resting upon the great vein of the body, near 
the backbone, compresses it, and arrests the flow of the blood more 
or less. If the arrest is partial, the sleep is disturbed, and there are 
unpleasant dreams, a state of things carefully to be avoided when we 
remember that "the man who dreams does but half sleep. The child 
who dreams scarcely sleeps at all." 



UN CATCHING COLD. 121 

Too MUCH ATTENTION cannot be paid to the proper ventilation of sleep- 
ing-rooms. In too many cases this important subject is entirely neglected. 
The sleeper retires to rest in an apartment from which every effort has 
been made to exclude the outer air until it seems almost hermetically 

'eel and rises with a dull headache, and a feverish, unrefreshed sensa- 
tion to go about the duties of the day. 

ON CATCHING COLD. 

It is a very common, but a very great, mistake to attach little import- 
ance to catching cold. How frequently we hear the remark in reference to 
some one being indisposed, " Oh, it's nothing ; only a severe cold." Con- 
sidering that in adults severe cold is the cause of one-half " the ills that 
flesh is heir to," it will readily be understood that colds with children are 
of the greatest consequence, for, in the language of one whose name is the 
synonym for nursing, " It is as easy to put out a sick baby's life as it is to 
put out the flame of a candle." 

The most common kind of a cold is that in the head, professionally 
'! scribed as ait'trrh, which consists of inflammation of the mucous mem- 
brane of the air passages, and is ordinarily caused by the child having 
been exposed to a draught, having got its clothes wet and not been able 
to have them changed, or by not being sufficiently warmly clad when the 
body is getting cool after being heated. The latter is the most to be 
feared, as in this condition the body is incapable, from exhaustion, of 
reaction, and the exposure intensifies the depression. 

WET CLOTHING does not frequently produce " a cold " if the child is 
walking or running about, and is able to get the things changed when the 
active exercise ceases, and avoids all exposure for some little time ; but 
where exertion has been indulged in, and the body is in a state of perspir- 
ation, then, if the child receives a chill from wet feet or any other cause, 
and does not continue its play or its excessive exercise, catarrh is almost 
inevitable. 

When it is remembered that a neglected cold sometimes produces bron- 
chitis, pneumonia, quinsy, rheumatism, erysipelas, toothache, neuralgia, 
inflammatory fever, consumption, etc., it is scarcely possible to impress 
upon mothers too strongly the great necessity for extreme care in this 
matter; and as prevention should be much more easy when the cause of 
a complaint is understood, I propose to try and explain in as simple lan- 
guage as possible the why and wherefore. 



122 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

The action of cold is to partially close the pores of the skin, check the 
natural perspiration by constricting and obstructing the vessels of the 
skin, and so throw more blood inwardly, producing internal congestions ; 
for the outer skin being incapable of performing its functions, and per- 
spiration being an absolute necessity, the inner skin, or mucous membrane, 
has to do the work, and hence the inflammation. 

THE EFFECT OF COLD is felt to a greater or less degree according to the 
capillary circulation. If this be weak, or be rendered so by excitement, ex- 
ercise, or by sleep, the danger is increased ; consequently children and 
any one else, for matter of that are most susceptible to cold when com- 
ing out of a hot room, after being unduly heated by running, or when 
sleeping. 

From this it will be understood that the chilling influences enumerate.! 
derange the balance of the circulation, and by determining a correspond- 
ing amount of congestion inwardly, fix it in some part previously weak- 
ened and made susceptible to disease ; or, in still plainer language, the 
cold flies to the weakest part, which accounts for one person getting 
rheumatism, another congestion of the lungs, a third a sore throat, and a 
fourth, perhaps merely a cold in the head or chest. 

To CURE A COLD is to restore the action of the skin and induce perspir- 
ation, and this, if done at the proper time, when the symptoms are first 
observed, is exceedingly simple. People may sneer as they will at the 
mention of the word gruel, but a basin-full of hot gruel, made thin, and 
taken when in bed, will invariably arrest an ordinary catarrh. If the 
chill be severe, the child's feet should be placed in warm water, a little 
extra clothing be placed on the bed, and the patient allowed to lie in bed 
a little longer than usual the next morning ; but the apartment must not 
be too warm or close, or the additional clothing be too great, as, though 
the cure may be accelerated thereby, the susceptibility is increased, and 
the child rendered more liable to a recurrence of the attack. 

To those who will not believe in anything old-fashioned or simple, the 
plan of a "wet sheet pack" will be found equally efficacious. This 
is managed by spreading three blankets on the bed and putting on 
on the top a sheet, which has been saturated in hot water and wrung 
out. The child is then placed upon the sheet, enveloped in it, and 
the blankets wrapped tightly around the whole body excepting the 
head, and allowed to remain in this situation for about an hour, when a 
a quick sponging of cold water should be given, followed by a brisk and 
thorough rubbing with dry towels. 



TEETHING. 123 

ANOTHER REMEDY believed in by many of our medical brethren is the 
" dry" plan, which, at any rate, has the merit of simplicity, for it consi 
in merely abstaining from every kind of liquid until the disorder is gone. 

Although opinions may differ, however, as to the precise method of cur<% 
and any of those given will be found equally efficient, there is no differ- 
ence of opinion as to the cause and prevention. The too frequent can s<^ 
is simply the result of carelessness or imprudence in not protecting the 
body against the variation of temperature, an insufficient use of cold or 
warm water to the body, or plainly, uncleanliness, sleeping under too 
much clothing, or by sleeping in badly-ventilated rooms ; but the first 
mentioned, the passing from a hot room out into the open air, or into a 
room where the temperature is less, without being suitably attired, is the 
most frequent and the most to be guarded against with children. 

The prevention of cold is best achieved by diminishing the susceptibil- 
ity of the system by abstemious living, taking regular and daily exercise 
in the open air, and a morning bath of cold water if the child be strong 
enough, and if not, a tepid one ; but the best prevention and cure for col<U 
is " the cold water cure." 

TEETHING. 

is one of the most distressing of the ordinary ailments of children, for it 
comes to them at an age when they are incapable of making the nature 
of their sufferings known, and as they do suffer most acutely sometimes 
during the process of dentition, it is very trying to mothers and nurses to 
have to witness their torture and be unable toalleviate it because the 
poor little mites cannot explain their symptoms. 

Being one of the very common ills that flesh is heir to, it is a time fre- 
quently regarded by some as more troublesome than important a great 
mistake, to prevent which a simple statement showing the action of one 
of the phases of the disease may be advisable. The chief disorders of the 
first set of teeth are caries and inflammation in the periosteal membranes, 
terminating in abscess, or what is commonly called gumboil. The first 
effect of inflammation in the periosteum is to create pain, tenderness and 
swelling in that part of the gum in close proximity to the tooth, and an 
effusion of fluid between the fang and its investing membrane, which is 
thus converted into a sort of cyst or tiny sack of skin. Repeated attacks 
of inflammation at length end in the formation of pus, which either bursts 
through the tumour in the gum or may be removed by lancing. Some- 
times after the abscess has burst or been opened, a fungus springs up 
from the diseased membrane lining the cavity. With some children tin

presence of the abscess having produced absorption of a portion of the 
alveolar process at its lowest part, it effuses its contents through the aper- 
ture thus formed, and matter forces itself along the surface of the lower 
jaw, and forms an external tumor near its base. 

WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESS OF DENTITION in actual infants, the time 
at which it takes place is naturally subject to slight variation, when it is 
stated that many medical men give instances in their experience of chil- 
dren being born with teeth, or having cut them almost immediately after 
birth Louia XIV., of France, and Richard III., of England, being historic 
cases in point ; the usual time, however, when babies begin to be troubled 
with the advent of teeth is at the seventh month, the period of the first 
detention lasting up to the age of two years or two and a half years. 

The symptoms of teething in a healthy child are that for some time be- 
fore the'gums are much swollen, there is an excessive flow of saliva from 
the mouth, and the child indulges in what is known to most as "drib- 
Ming," at the same time evincing a very strong desire to drag anything 
upon which it can fix its tiny little clutch into its mouth, while, if we place 
our finger into its mouth we perceive at once a decided attempt to bite, 
which affords a relief to the irritation of the gums. Where the child is 
inconvenienced only to the extent described there is no remedy required 
provided there is no constipation, but where this is the case small doses of 
castor oil are the safest. As to the article it should be given to suck, I 
personally prefer an ivory ring or a " finger" of crust of bread, great care 
Wing observed in the latter case that it is taken away before there is a 
possibility of its being broken or bitten off. 

WHEN THE CHILD is EXTREMELY RESTLESS, cross and uneasy, crying 
bitterly without any apparent cause, and refuses all ordinary attempts at 
pacification, its suffering is very considerable, which is increased by its in- 
effectual efforts to sleep for any length of time. The cheeks become 
flushed at this time, and if the local inflammation continue to increase the 
gums may ulcerate ; in this case apply a little borax and honey to them ; 
but where the irritation continues and the pain is obviously great it will 
be necessary to lance the gums, for which purpose it is almost unnecessary 
to add the services of a surgeon should be secured at once. At this 
time it is more than ever necessary to keep the bowels well open, a mild 
attack of diarrhoea being far more preferable under the existing circum- 
stances than the reverse state of things. 

ALL FOOD REQUIRES TO BE CAREFULLY CHEWED in order that the vari- 
ous organs may perfectly perform their proper functions, and this can only 
be the case when the meat, or whatever it may be, is broken into minute 



TEETHING. 125 

portions and duly mixed with saliva, without which it will not be proper- 
ly digested. The horrors and evils of indigestion are too well known to 
need commenting upon here, but the necessity for a due attention to the 
mastication of food by children will be seen when it is stated that a weak 
stomach acts tardily and imperfectly upon anything introduced into it not 
properly chewed ; and the consequences are, the warmth and moisture of 
the stomach evolve gases, acids are formed, and then follow those distress- 
ing symptoms such as loss of appetite, flatulence, furred tongue, etc. 

The period of " teething" is more than interesting, from the fact that, at 
this stage of child-life, the whole organization seems to undergo a transi- 
tion. The features, hitherto more or less expressionless, become decided 
and distinct ; the eye becomes endued with expression, through which the 
mind seems to speak, as it were ; the round appearance of the facial out- 
line appears elongated, the result of the teeth expanding the jaws ; the 
forehead is perceptibly developed, and, in short, the entire face assumes 
an animation previously unknown, but most precious to mothers, on ac- 
count of its being the ordinary time when " baby is beginning to notice." 

THE ORDER IN WHICH TEETH usually make their appearance is, first, the 
two central incisors of the lower jaw appear ; then shortly after those of 
the upper jaw, followed by the lower lateral incisors, and then by the up- 
per lateral incisors. At the age of a year or fourteen months the four first 
molar teeth should begin to show, and at the sixteenth to the twentieth 
month the lower and upper canine teeth, followed by the four last molars. 

Although the suffering of infants from the process of dentition arises 
mainly from irritation of the gums, owing to the teeth working their way 
through, it is not in the mouth alone that pain is caused, ; and where this 
is excessive, or in children whose constitutions are naturally irritable, the 
irritation is reflected by the nervous system to some other organ or system 
of organs. 

THE MOST ORDINARY EFFECT of this is stomach-ache, or diarrhoea, with 
griping pain, which, if in a mild form, is the least to be feared of all the 
unpleasantnesses arising from teething ; and though its violence may be 
moderated, it should not be entirely arrested. Under these circumstances, 
a child soon gets weak and thin, and its flesh soft and flabby ; but, gene- 
rally speaking, this need not (except, of course, in an extreme case) be 
viewed with alarm ; for, as soon as the teeth are through, nature soon rights 
itself, and the little one will resume its wonted good looks. When, how- 
ever, the symptoms are very distressing, by the quantity and frequency 
of the discharge, a chalk mixture, with a drop or two of laudanum to the 
ounce, according to the age of the child, may be given, in the event of a 



19G THK HOMK, FARM AXU BUSINESS CYCLOP.EDIA. 

medical mail not being procurable. Where there is a great pain and flat- 
ulence, an occasional warm bath, and the use of liniment, composed of half 
a drachm of laudanum to two ounces of compound camphor liniment, or a 
mustard or linseed meal poultice, composed of one-third of the former to 
two-thirds of the latter. When the foregoing symptoms are accompanied 
by vomiting, it is exceedingly troublesome, and if the sickness is not reliev- 
ed by the division of the gums, it should be checked by administering a 
half-drop or a drop of laudanum. 

BESIDES THE MALADIES mentioned that are the outcome of teething, 
there are many others, such as eruptions of the skin, spasm of the glottis, 
and affections of the nervous system, generally of too complicated a nature 
to treat in this article, as the remedies necessitated are as complex as the 
diseases ; but there is one serious disorder connected with dentition un- 
fortunately too common. I allude to convulsions, the treatment of which 
should be known to all. 

CONVULSIONS in their mild form consist of muscular twitchings of tlu- 
face, accompanied by an obvious difficulty in breathing and a rolling of 
the eyes. When severe, the child becomes insensible, and the muscles of 
the head, neck, and extremities are convulsed in various directions. The 
eyes are insensible to light, and turned rigidly up to one side. The ap- 
pearance and symptoms vary, of course, for, in addition to those named, 
with some children the face is congested, but sometimes pale, the lips 
livid, and there is frothing at the mouth. The hands are usually tightly 
clenched, and the thumbs turned inward, with the fingers on them, and 
in some cases the soles of the feet are turned together, with the great toe 
bent into the sole. 

The treatment for convulsions is, as a rule, a warm bath, and, in the 
absence of a doctor, the best thing to be done is to immerse the child in 
warm water of about ninety degrees temperature for about ten minutes or 
a quarter of an hour, applying at the same time a cold, wet towel for two 
or three minutes to the little sufferer's head. Previous to the bath, which 
will take at least a few minutes to get ready, loosen all the clothing about 
the neck, chest and body, raise the head, sprinkle the face with water, 
and admit plenty of fresh air. 

WITH REGARD TO THE GENERAL TREATMENT of children during teething, 
their heads should be kept cool and their feet warm, and, if the weather 
will admit, they should be bathed in cold water, especially about the 
head, and taken out daily in the open air. At night it is equally essential 
that their heads be kept cool, and therefore no caps or coverings should 
be used. 



wHooriNG-con;n. 127 

As before stated, diarrhoea during dentition, unless very severe, should 
not be stopped; but regarded as an effort of nature to relieve congestion 
to the head ; and where the opposite effect is the case, purgatives should 
be avoided, and the bowels regulated by suitable diet ; in obstinate cases 
by injections. Constipation in infants may be almost entirely attri- 
buted to defective diet, and if, while nursing, mothers and nurses would 
carefully avoid any article of food or drink of an indigestible or stimulat- 
ing character, this ailment would be comparatively unknown. 

WHOOPS-COUGH. 

This disease, almost absolutely confined to infants and children, is, 
luckily for them, more distressing in its symptoms than dangerous in its 
effects, a case of whooping-cough, pur et simple, being rarely fatal. Like 
croup, it is more common with very young children, the usual age when 
they are more subject to it being from two to ten years ; but, unliko 
croup, it is more common to girls than to boys, and appears but once in a 
lifetime, though cases have been known were the cough continued daily 
at a certain hour for several months, and, after ceasing for some time, 
returned for two successive seasons. 

The symptoms which usually precede this malady are those of ordinary 
influenza. First and foremost there is a languor, restlessness, feverish - 
ness and unaccountable irritation, except that the little one is thought 
" to have caught a slight cold," then loss of appetite, sneezing, coughing, 
follow, with a running at the nose ; this is in the case of an ordinary and 
not severe attack. Where the disease is in an aggravated form the fever 
is more intense, the thirst greater, the pulse quicker, and the oppression 
and distress in proportion, the cough very frequent and painful, dry at 
tirst, but with excessive expectoration afterward. This may be called the 
h'rst stage of the disease, and is the customary prelude to whooping, but it 
is perfectly possible to dispense with these preliminaries, and for a child 
to be suddenly seized with the too well-known cough. These symptoms 
ordinarily continue from ten days to a fortnight. 

THE SECOND STAGE is marked by the dying-out of the symptoms of cold 
and the commencement of the fits of coughing, which are best described 
as a number of expirations made with such violence, and repeated in such 
quick succession, that the child seems almost in danger of suffocation. 
The face and neck are swollen and livid, the eyes protruded and full of 
tears ; at length, one or two inspirations are made with similar violence, 
and by them the peculiar whooping sound is produced ; a little rest prob- 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

jibly follows, and is succeeded by another fit of coughing, and another 
whoop, until after a succession of these actions, the paroxysm is termi- 
nated by vomiting, or a discharge of mucus from the lungs, or perhaps 
both. The duration of this stage is usually from six weeks to a couple of 
months, but sometimes continues for a much longer period, the disease, in 
some cases, lasting from the beginning of Winter until the end of Spring. 
The debilitating results of the disease depend to a great extent upon the 
violence and duration of the attack, and the strength or weakness of the 
constitution, but as a rule, if there are no complications, these are of no 
great moment. The frequent vomiting decreases the appetite, and dis- 
turbs digestion, which interferes with nutrition, and the child naturally 
loses flesh, which is more or less flabby, and the skin is unusually dark, 
especially underneath the eyes. 

THE SUBSIDING OF the attack is marked by the fits of coughing becom- 
ing less frequent, though possibly they may be as tierce as ever, the 
paroxysms lasting from a minute to a quarter of an hour. In proportion 
to their violence and duration will be the child's breathlessness and fright 
and its efforts to respire. If in a recumbent position it will suddenly 
jump up and seize hold of whatever or whoever is nearest, in order to be 
assisted in overcoming the spasm. When the fit is over the child appears 
exhausted, and requires a short rest to recover itself; but then and during 
the interval to the next cough, it is comparatively easy and cheerful, often 
playing about as usual, and not averse to food, except where the case is a 
severe one, when extreme languor supervenes. 

The period at which these paroxysms recur varies considerably ; dur- 
ing the early part of the attack they are very frequent about every half 
hour, and in some extremely severe cases as often as every ten minutes 
the chief cause of their return being the accumulation of mucus. Conse- 
quently, if this be got rid of by the coughing, the fit will be light ; but if 
it is expelled with difficulty the efforts will be greater, and the cough 
renewed almost immediately. These fits are produced by many things 
a hearty meal, a fit of passion, crying, fright or laughter, will either of 
them be sufficient to bring on an attack. 

Although we have stated that this disease is rarely attended with fatal 
results, itmust be distinctly understood that this statement applies to 
whooping-cough per se ; it is perfectly correct, but for fear any one should 
not be sufficiently careful, it is a disorder which, if improperly treated, or 
if the case be one of an extremely acute character, may lead to something 
of a complicated and highly dangerous nature. 



VACCINATION'. 129 

It is A COMPLAINT which lends itself a great deal more to careful nurs- 
ing than to an elaborate course of medicine, for it will run its course, and 
requires guiding and watching more than checking, great care being 
necessary to note the symptoms, lest they assume a conspicuous or alarm- 
ing character, and by appropriate treatment prevent the affection having 
those complications alluded to which constitute it a disease of danger. 
On the slightest appearance either of inflammatory affection of the lungs 
or of a tendency to convulsion a medical man should be sent for immedi- 
ately. 

During the first stage an emetic of ipecacuanha, followed by an expec- 
torant every four hours, should be given, the latter consisting of 
ipecacuanha wine, sirup of squills, a little sirup of white poppies and 
almond milk, and some mild aperient, such as castor oil, or salts and senna, 
the emetic only to be repeated occasionally. The rooms to which the 
child should be confined should be of an equable temperature, about sixty- 
five degrees, the bedroom being ventilated during the day and the sitting- 
room during the night ; but the windows of the apartment must on no 
account be opened while the patient is in them. 

When the second stage arrives, while proper attention is paid to tem- 
perature, the cough will be found much slighter and the expectoration 
much less than if the child were permitted to be exposed to the external 
air, the emetic being continued occasionally, and also the mixture, with a 
few drops of laudanum added to it. 

WITH REGARD TO CHANGE OF AIR, there is no doubt that while the at- 
tack is unsubdued, no matter what the weather may be, the patient should 
be confined not only to the house, but to rooms, as already stated, but 
when the disease is on the wane the change from a cold situation to one of 
warm temperature is most beneficial in accelerating a return to con- 
valescence, though the greatest caution is needed in this matter. 

The diet of the child during the entire illness is a most important 
feature in connection with the treatment, and should consist chiefly of 
milk and farinaceous foods, meat being of too heating a nature, unless the 
child is very weak and low, in which case tolerably good broth will be the 
best mode of giving animal food. 

VACCINATION. 

Unfortunately that dangerous and much dreaded malady smallpox 
is prevalent, and it would be well for parents and others to be reminded 
of the necessity of revaccination every seven years. 
I 



130 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

It is astonishing that though this discovery is undoubtedly one of the 
very greatest blessings to poor humanity it should now be thought so little 
of, and that there should be some who actually decry and refuse to accept 
it as such, when there is no doubt that if every one had followed the in- 
structions as to revaccination, by this time smallpox would have ceased 
altogether. 

No lan^uao-e can be too strong to depict the horrors of this disease, or to 
denounce the culpable ignorance of those who, blinding themselves to the 
blessings of vaccination, set the law at defiance and thus endanger the 
lives of their fellow-creatures. Supposing it could be proved (which it 
cannot) that in some cases it has been the means of imparting disease, the 
overwhelming number of cases where it has not, but has been a preven- 
tive of this terrible malady, ought to show its necessity on the beneficent 
principle of studying the greatest happiness of the greatest number. 

To children smallpox has ever been distressingly fatal, and though it is 
impossible to give any course of treatment for its cure in an article of this 
character, as so much depends upon the violence of the case, the state of 
the patient's constitution, and the stage of the complaint, it may be said 
that the old practice of close, hot rooms, warm clothing, and hot drinks 
are proved mistakes ; cool, well-ventilated apartments, comfortably cool 
bedclothes and cooling drinks having been found to be not only more 
pleasant but more successful in their results. When the disease first 
makes its appearance, if the fever be moderate and no professional advice 
be procurable, the patient should be confined to bed, and cool drinks and 
a dose or two of purgative medicine administered. 

FEVERS. 

MEASLES. An acute specific disease febrile and infectious, ushered in 
with catarrhal symptoms and characterized by an eruption on the skin, 
which appears usually on the fourth day. 

USUAL SYMPTOMS. After a period of incubation varying from twelve 
to fourteen days (the period of incubation in cases produced 
by inoculation is seven days), there is manifested alternate chilli- 
ness and heat, a quickened pulse, aching in the limbs, slight headache, 
soon followed by redness of the eyes, coryza, huskiness and hoarse cough. 
On the fourth day there is an eruption of soft, circular, very slightly ele- 
vated dusky red spots, which appear first on the forehead, and extend over 
the face, neck, and whole body. The spots gradually coalesce and present 
a peculiar crescentic or horseshoe shape. The spots disappear on pressure. 



FEVERS. 



131 



They attain their greatest intensity on the fourth day from their invasion, 
an<l by the seventh day they fade away with a slight desquamation of the 
cuticle. As a rule the fever does not abate on the appearance of the 
eruption. 

The contagion of measles is active during the prodromic stage. Red 
spots are visible on the velum palati four, five, or six days before the 
eruption appears on the skin. 

OCCASIONAL SYMPTOMS. There may be no prodromata whatever, or 
the attack may be ushered in with convulsions (especially in children), or 
there may be delirium, or there may be a great amount of fever, or there 
may be and often is sore throat ; more rarely severe headache, and some- 
times absence of the coryza. 

The eruption may be scanty, or most abundant and confluent, but the 
quantity of the eruption per se does not affect the gravity of the attack ; 
the colour of the eruption may be dark, constituting so called " black 
measles " ; there may be petechiae, which do not fade on pressure and 
resemble purpura; these do not per se affect the prognosis. Miliary vesi- 
cles are often present, and when abundant the amount of desquamation 
will be greater. 

AVERAGE MORTALITY. One in fifteen. 

PROGNOSIS. If uncomplicated, favourable. Unfavourable signs are 
great fever, great dyspnoea, sudden vanishing of the rash, together with 
an access of delirium ; brown dry tongue, with special severity of some 
two or three symptoms ; petechiae, with a typhoid form of fever. Capil- 
Jary bronchitis and pneumonia are the most frequent proximate causes of 
death. 

TREATMENT. The child must be kept in bed in a large, well-ventilated 
iroom, free from drafts a point of vital importance, looking to the fre- 
quency and danger of chest complications. The diet must be low. Tepid 
drinks may be freely given. It is very important in measles, as in all in- 
tfectious fevers, to remove all discharge and soiled linen instantly ; the 
motions should be passed into vessels containing chloride of lime, carbolic 
acid, or Condy's fluid; this with ventilation will go far to prevent infec- 
tion. There is no objection, if it be grateful to the patient, to have the 
body gently sponged with warm water; and if itching be much complain- 
ed of, inunction with unsalted lard is useful. Cough is often the first 
troublesome system which requires special treatment. A mixture con- 
taining citrate of potash and ipecacuanha wine with a few drops of nepen- 
the or Tinct. Camph. Co., will usually quiet this. If the fever runs high, 
(the weak mineral acids sweetened and largely diluted will be very grate-

SCARLATINA.

nied by a peculiar eruption of the skin. After a period of mcubatio

day), hurried breathing, furred tongue, hot skin and thirst. At the same 
time there is lassitude and restlessness, headache and at night delirium. 
On the second day, usually about the root of the neck and upper part of 
the chest, appears the eruption, which is a scarlet efflorescence consisting 
of innumerable red spots at first separated by natural skin, but soon coal- 
escing and producing a general redness ; the skin is rendered pale by pres- 
sure, but the redness immediately returns the rash is not elevated to the 
touch. It is most abundant about the hips and loins, and the flexures of 
the joints in fact where the papilhe of the skin are largest. The eruption 
reaches its maximum intensity on the third or fourth day ; by the fifth it 
has begun to fade, and by the eighth it disappears. It goes off in an order 
corresponding with its invasion. Miliaria are often present, perhaps more 
commonly in adults than in children ; they in no wise affect the prognosis. 
The sore throat is very important, especially in children. A child may die 
from throat disease without any complaint about its throat having been 
made. The throat should therefore always be carefully examined. The 
tonsils will usually be found enlarged and inflamed, and often coated with 
a thick white tenacious mucus. 

CROUP. 

This disease is characterized by difficulty of breathing ; hoarseness ; a 
ringing cough, which, when once heard, will be distinctly remembered ; 
the cough is followed by a " crowing inspiration." 

There is inflammatory fever ; frequent and hard pulse ; thirst. 

The attack is most liable to come on in the night either altogether un- 
expected, or preceded by a cold, sore throat, or catarrh. 

TREATMENT. Apply to the throat very cold wet cloths well covered 
with dry. Keep the child in bed. Rub with the dry hand the back and 
limbs, and continue this until a hot bath is made ready ; renewing the 
cold cloths to the throat every few moments. When the room is made 
very warm and the bath at hand, place the child in the hot water, as hot 
as can be borne, and rub the chest and abdomen and the whole body very 
briskly. Add more hot water, and keep the body (even to the neck) im- 
mersed. 

Have a dry hot sheet ready in which to wrap and rub dry the little 
patient. If fever is high, now put on the abdominal bandage wrung from 
warm water. Cover well with dry flannel a small blanket or even a 
good-sized one is none too much. Apply again the cold wet cloth to the 
throat Keep the feet warm ; and, if the breathing is not easier now, fo- 



134 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

merit the throat and upper part of the chest for twenty minutes alternately 
with the cold compress. 

Pat and rub the back and chest. Manipulate the arms and legs. Give 
drinks of hot water and of cold. Follow the symptoms with " all dili- 
gence." Do not relax effort until the breathing is liberated. If the bowels 
are not free, give full warm enema. 

If there is tendency to coldness of extremities, give hot foot bath occa- 
sionally ; also apply diy flannels heated very hot to the throat, if they 
seem more agreeable than the hot fomentation. 

Keep the patient in a warm well-ventilated room. Give only baked 
apple, or toast water, or gruel as food, until the symptoms yield positively. 

I have been told by my patrons that it often occurs in their domestic 
practice with children, that, by the time the patient is rubbed with the 
dry hand, having the cold compress on the throat until the hot bath is 
made ready, there is no need of the bath ; the breathing is relieved. But 
it is not always so. I have treated cases of what is called " membranous 
croup," and it lasted persistently for days. I never lost a case of croup. 
But it is a dreaded disease, and justly so. 

MUMPS (PAEOTITIS). 

This disease often prevails epidemically. 

It usually affects children and young persons, and is contagious. 

The parotid gland swells ; swelling beneath the ear, the chin, and all 
around the neck, deforming the countenance curiously. 

It affects one side only sometimes, but usually both. 

The swelling is hot, tender, and painful ; the lower jaw can scarcely be 
moved. In about four days the disease begins to decline, and usually lasts 
in all about ten days. 

Sometimes the swelling suddenly becomes transferred to the mammas in 
the female and to the testicle in the male, and may oscillate between the 
throat and the mammae or testicle. Metastasis to the brain is known to 
take place also, but this is rare. 

TREATMENT. Very little treatment is necessary. Apply warm cloths to 
the swelling ; let them be kept on constantly. 

If there is general feverishness, a tepid sponge bath and enema of tepid 
water. A little gruel or bran tea as food. 

Keep the patient comfortably warm and quiet. If metastasis to the 
parts named occur, a warm sitz bath or fomentation to the affected region 
will give relief. Keep the feet warm. 



DIPHTHERIA AtVlDKNTS. 135 

Should the brain become affected, give very hot sitz and foot bath ten 
minutes. Follow this with enenia of hot water. Apply cool cloths to the 
head, or, if more agreeable to the patient, warm spongings. Let the pa- 
tient be kept in bed and seek to induce perspiration by applying bottles 
of hot water to the back and feet and drinking of hot water. 

In fact, the treatment now should be the same as for inflammation of 
the brain. 

DIPHTHERIA. 

In this to be dreaded and terrible disease, a false membrane forms in the 
throat, and if the larynx becomes affected the chances of recovery are very 
few indeed. Frequent vomiting, diarrhoea, hemorrhage from the nostrils 
or elsewhere, frequency and fulness of the pulse, convulsions, delirium, 
and coma, are sj'inptoms which denote great danger. Occasional!^ the 
muscles of both the upper and lower limbs are affected. The chief objects 
in the treatment are to palliate symptoms, and support the powers of life 
by the judicious employment of tonic remedies, conjoined with alimenta- 
tion and alcoholic stimulants. The latter are given in large quantities. 
The best advice to give to mothers in regard to diphtheria is, send instant- 
ly for the doctor. Do not delay one moment ! 

ACCIDENTS. 

It is an accepted axiom that accidents will happen, no matter how well 
regulated the household ; and though much has been written with a view 
to avert the more serious calamities supposed to be the outcome of acci- 
dent, but which are invariably the result of carelessness, children still 
manage to burn themselves at fires, to scald themselves with hot water, to 
cut their fingers, to break their heads, etc. 

As a rule, the remedies required to be of any service should be applied 
at once ; and it is, therefore, no earthly use suggesting antidotes or appli- 
ances only to be met with in a doctor's surgery. I shall, therefore, in the 
few suggestions I make, more particularly dwell upon those simple reme- 
dies which may reasonably be expected to be found in every home. 

In the summer months, when the weather is seasonable, the heat is of- 
tentimes sufficient to cause children to bleed at the nose. In such cases, 
if the bleeding be not excessive or too frequent, it is not desirable to stop 
it, as, when caused by an undue fulness of the blood-vessels of the head, it 
affords great relief. When, however, the bleeding is the result of a knock 
or blow, cold applications should be applied to the nose or forehead, and 
the child kept standing in the open air. 



136 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

Another excellent way of arresting the bleeding is to cause the arms to 
be raised above the head, and kept so for a few minutes, which wil 
have the desired effect. In the event of these remedies proving ineffectual, 
and it being evident that the bleeding is dangerous, the nostrils must 
plumed with pieces of linen rag made into stoppers of oval shape, abc 
oneTnch in the long diameter and half an inch in the transverse, sufficient 
linen being left hanging in order to withdraw them when necessary, 
orreat thing to determine in cases where the bleeding is not the result o 
accident is whether it be a disease, or Nature's mode of assisting the re- 
moval of one; and this, of course, can only be arrived at by a knowledge 
of the child's state of health at the time. 

CUTS. 

With regard to the bleeding caused by a cut from a knife, or something 
similarly sharp, if it be only slight, after being bathed with cold wate 
the ed-es or sides of the wound should be brought together, and bound 
with narrow strips of arnica plaster, if this is to be had ; but if not, a 
pie band of linen, smeared with the white of an egg, will be the besl 
stitute. If the band becomes tight, and causes pain owing to the swel 
don't remove the bandage, but insert the blade of a pair of scissors undc 
neath the binding on the opposite side to the wound, and cut 
across Where it is necessary to remove the strapping on account of 1 
being pain and throbbing, the part affected should be soaked in warm 
water and a soft, warm poultice applied. When the wound does not show 
sicms of inflammation, and the discharge is good, that is to say.resembl 
cream in consistence and custard in colour, the bandage may be put - 
a-ain ; but when the edges are inflamed, or pale and flabby, and 1 
Charge thin and objectionable in its odour.a single strap of adhesive pl 
should be used to keep the edges together, and this should be covei 
a warm poultice. 

When a mishap of this kind occurs, it is either a vein or an artery t 
is cut In the former case the blood is dark-coloured, and wil 
steady stream, which can usually be stopped by the application o 
water or ice, and by exposing the wound to the open air. In the latter 
blood is bright-red, and flows in jets, when, if the bleeding is excessive, 
stroncr bandage should be tied around the limb, just above the wound, and 
between it and the heart, and compressed sufficiently tight [by means of a 
stick inserted underneath and twisted) until the circulation be stoppei 



BUHNS. 

When the wound is not a clean cut, and there is any foreign substance, 
such as dirt, hair, etc., it must be carefully removed by sponging with cold 
water. 

BUKNS. 

Accidents caused by burning demand immediate attention, and can only 
be cured in one way by excluding the air from the part affected. Where 
it is a case of the clothes having caught fire, envelop the child in the 
heavest article available, such as a blanket, tablecloth, curtain, etc., and 
roll it over and over on the ground until the flames are extinguished, in 
the event of there not being sufficient water at hand for that purpose. 

This done, the charred garments should be quickly but most gently re- 
moved, and cut away, instead of being torn from the body, in order that 
the damaged skin should not be unnecessarily irritated ; but where a piece 
of the underlinen happens to be burnt into the wound, or is not easily 
detached, cut away all around it, and leave it to come away afterward. 
Then immediately cover the injured surface with something that will 
exclude the air, either with flour sprinkled thickly over the wound, with 
cotton- wool steeped in oil, or with a piece of linen on which is spread a 
layer of soap about the sixteenth of an inch thick. When procurable, a 
better remedy than either of those mentioned, is to apply strips of lint 
saturated in carron oil, which dressing should be left on as long as possi- 
ble, until they become loosened or objectionable from the 'discharges, it 
being most desirable that these bandages be changed as seldom as possi- 
ble, as their removal is apt to cause detachment of portions of the new 
skin, which is most painful and undesirable. When there is much discharge 
it must be removed, and the place kept as clean as possible. 

When the injury is of an extensive character, and a shock ensues, the 
shivering is best checked by the application of hot bottles to the hands 
and feet, and the administering of hot drinks either warm sherry or warm 
brandy and water. To prevent disfigurement from accidents of this nature, 
the child must be carefully watched until the part is completely healed, 
and must be prevented from sitting or lying in anything but a straight 
posture, to avoid contraction of the skin. 

The danger attending burns depends more upon their superficial extent 
than the depth of the injury those to the body, head or neck being much 
more dangerous than those to the hands or feet, the neck being the most 
risky portion of all. 

Where the part is simply blistered, though these be extensive in charac- 
ter and large in number, it is comparatively of little moment as long as they 



138 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

are whole. They must consequently not be broken, but allowed to remain, 
and the fluid to accumulate till the new skin forms underneath. When 
this formation takes place, the part becomes distended and painful, there 
is a red line round the edge of the blister, and the contained fluid looks 
milky. It may then be let out by puncturing with a needle, so that it all 
escapes. 

SCALDS. 

Scalds from hot water, as a rule, are not so severe, as excepting in ex- 
treme cases, the scurf skin is only raised like an ordinary blister, and the 
dressing being wet, can be removed without difficulty. Any of the reme- 
dies prescribed for burns are equally efficacious for scalds, but if the scalded 
surface be instantly covered with cotton-wool, it is, if the accident be of a 
slight character, sufficient. Another admirable remedy, more particularly 
on account of its usually being " in the house," is lard. That specially 
prepared by chemists is, of course, the best ; but this only means the ordi- 
nary kind divested of the salt by washing. It should be thickly spread on 
pieces of old, soft linen, and when placed on the scald or burn, be kept in 
its place by bandages of lint, or better still, by strips of calico, torn from 
an old garment, always bearing in mind that the great thing is to protect 
the damaged part from the air, and remembering on no account to apply 
cold water or similar cold bandages. 

BEUISES. 

Bruises from knocks and tumbles are by far the most frequent of the 
numerous accidents of the nursery, and where the injury is slight and the 
skin not lacerated, a warm application of arnica (which should always be 
kept where there are children) and water, in the proportion of one part 
of arnica to ten of water, is advisable ; but in the absence of this, the old- 
fashioned remedy of covering the bruise with fresh butter should be re- 
sorted to. 

Jammed fingers, through the unexpected shutting of a drawer or door, 
though not usually looked upon as at all serious casualties, may some- 
times be attended by the most serious consequences, for if all the parts of 
the end of the fingers be injured, the whole (bone and flesh) may mortify. 
In ordinary cases of this kind, the best and quickest way of obtaining 
relief, is to plunge the finger or fingers into warm water as hot as the child 
can bear it. By this means the nail is softened, and yields so as to accom- 
modate itself to the blood poured out beneath it, and the pain is speedily 
lessened ; the finger should then be covered with a bread and water poul- 



HINTS TO HOITSKKKKFERS. 



139 



tice, pending the surgical treatment necessary where the fingers are badlj 
crushed. 

Instant care and attention in such cases will often prevent the loss of 
the nail, a result to be avoided if possible, since the formation and growth 
of the new nail are necessarily slow, and changes of shape frequently occur, 
sometimes resulting in permanent disfigurement.

CHOICE OF AETICLES OF FOOD. 

*s 
' OTHING is more important in the affairs of housekeeping 

than the choice of wholesome food. 

MACKEREL must be perfectly fresh. The firmness of the 
hVsh and the clearness of the eyes must be the criterion 
of fresh mackerel, as they are of other fish. 

FLOUNDERS, and all fiat white fish, are rigid and firm 
when fresh ; the under side should be of a rich cream 
colour. 

COD is known to be fresh by the rigidity of the muscle* 
(or flesh) ; the redness of the gills, and clearness of the eyes. 

SALMON. The flavour and excellence of this fish depend upon its fresh- 
ness, and the shortness of time since it was caught. 
HERRINGS can only be eaten when very fresh. 

FRESH WATER FISH. The remarks as to firmness and clear, fresh eyes, 
apply to this variety of fish, of which there are pike, perch, etc. 

LOBSTERS recently caught have always some remains of muscular action 
in the claws, which may be excited by pressing the eyes with the finger ; 
when this cannot be produced, the lobster must have been too long kept. 
When boiled, the tail preserves its elasticity if fresh, but loses it as soon 
as it becomes stale. 

CRABS have an agreeable smell when fresh. 
PRAWNS AND SHRIMPS, when fresh, are firm and crisp. 
OYSTERS. If fresh, the shell is firmly closed ; when the shells of oysters 
are opened, they are dead and unfit for food. The small-shelled oysters are

the finest in flavour. Larger kinds are generally considered only fit for 
stewing and sauces, though some persons prefer them. 

BEEF -The grain of ox beef, when good, is loose, the meat red, and 1 
fat inclining to yellow. When meat pressed by the finger rises up quickly, 
it may be considered as that of an animal which was in its prime ; wher 
the dent made by pressure returns slowly, or remains visible, the animal 
had probably past its prime, and the meat consequently must 



rior quality. 

VEAL should be delicately white, though it is often juicy and 
flavoured, when rather dark in colour. On examining the loin if the 
enveloping the kidney be white and firm looking, the meat will probably 
be prime, and recently killed. 

MUTTON The meat should be firm and close in gram, and red in col 
the fat white and firm. Mutton is in its prime when the sheep is about 
five years old, though it is often killed much younger. If too young, the 
flesh feels tender when pinched, if too old on being pinched it wrinkles up 
and so remains. In young mutton, the fat readily separates ; m old, it 
held together by strings of skin. 

LAMB -This meat will not keep long after it is killed. The large veil 
in the neck is bluish in colour when the fore-quarter is fresh green when 
becomin" stale. In the hind-quarter, if not recently killed, the fat of 1 
kidney will have a slight smell, and the knuckle will have lost its firmness 
PORK When </ ood the rind is thin, smooth, and cool to the touch ; 
when changing.from being too long killed.it becomes flaccid and clammy. 
BACON should have a thin rind, and the fat should be firm and tinged 
with red by the curing ; the flesh should be of a clear red, without into 
mixture of yellow, and it should firmly adhere to the bone. To judge the 
state of a ham, plunge a knife into it to the bone; on drawing ii 
particles of meat adhere to it, or if the smell is disagreeable, the cum 
has not been effectual, and the ham is not good ; it should, in such a si 
be immediately cooked. 

VENisoN.-When good, the fat is clear, bright, and of considerable thick- 



xuiuu.ia.-In choosing poultry, the age of the bird is the chief point 
to be attended to. An old turkey has rough and reddish legs ; a yo. 
one smooth and black. Fresh killed, the eyes are full and clear, and 
feet moist. When it has been kept too long, the parts about the vent 1

of feathers. Fowls and chickens should be plump on the breast, fat on the 
back, and white legged. 

GEESE. The bills and feet are red when old, yellow when young. Fresh 
killed, the feet are pliable, stiff when too long kept. Geese are called green 
while they are only two or three months old. 

DUCKS. Choose them with supple feet and hard, plump breasts. Tame 
ducks have yellow feet, wild ones red. 

PIGEONS are very indifferent food when they are too long kept. Supple- 
ness of the feet shows them to be young ; the state of the flesh is flaccid 
when thfv are getting bad from keeping. Tame pigeons are larger than 
the wild. 

PARTRIDGES, when young, have yellow legs and dark-coloured bills. 
Old partridges are very indifferent eating. 

WOODCOCK AND SNIPE, when old, have the feet thick and hard; when 
these are soft and tender, they are both young and fresh killed. When 
their bills become moist, and their throats muddy, they have been too long 
killed. 

SEASONABLE FOOD. 

There is an old maxim, " a place for everything and everything in its 
place." To which we beg to add another, " A season for eveiy thing, and 
everything in season."

The method of cutting up the carcases varies. That which we describe 
below is the most general. 

BEAF Fore Quarter. Fore rib (five ribs) ; middle rib (four ribs) ; chuck 
(three ribs). Shoulder piece (top of fore leg) ; brisket (lower or belly part 
of the ribs) ; clod (fore shoulder blade) ; neck ; shin (below the shoulder) ; 
cheek. 

Hind Quarter. Sirloin; rump; aitchbone these are the three divis- 
ions of the upper part of the quarter ; buttock and mouse-buttock, which 
divide the thigh ; veiny piece, joining buttock ; thick flank and thin flank 
(belly pieces) and leg. The sirloin and rump of both sides form a baron. 
Bur' ('.- In season all the year ; best in the icinter. 

MUTTON. Shoulder ; breast (the bell} 7 ) ; over which are the loin (chump 
or tail end). Loin (best end) ; and neck (best end) ; neck (scrag end). A 
chine is two necks ; a saddle, two loins ; then there are the leg and head. 
Mutton is the best in winter, spring, and autumn. 

LAMB is cut into fore quarter and hind quarter ; a saddle, or loin ; neck, 
breast, leg, and shoulder. Grass-lamb is in season from June to August. 

PORK is cut into leg, hand or shoulder ; hind loin ; fore loin ; belly part ; 
spare rib (or neck) ; and head. Pork is in season nearly all the yea r. 

VEAL is cut into neck (scrag end) ; neck (best end) ; loin (best end) ; 
loin (chump, or tail end) ; fillet (upper pai't of the hind leg) ; hind knuc- 
kle (which joins the fillet knuckle of fore leg ; blade (bone of shoulder) ; 
breast (best end) ; breast (brisket end) ; and hand. Veal is always in sea- 
son, but dear in the winter and spring. 

VENISON is cut into haunch (or back) : neck, shoulder, and breast. Doe- 
venison is best in January, October, November, and December, and buck~ 
venison in June, July, August, and September. 

OX-TAIL is much esteemed for purposes of soup ; so also is the CHEEK. 
The TONGUE is highly esteemed. 



146 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

CALVES' HEADS are very useful for various dishes; so also their KNUCK- 
LES, FEET, HEART, etc. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOKING. 

COOKING. Ten pounds of beef require from two hours to two hours and 
a half roasting, eighteen inches from a good fire. 

Six pounds require one hour and a quarter to one hour and a half, f< 
teen inches from a good, clear fire. 

Three ribs of beef, boned and rolled, tied round with paper, will require 
two hours and a half, eighteen inches from the fire, baste once only. 

The first three ribs of fifteen or twenty pounds, will take three hours or 
three and a half ; the fourth and fifth ribs will take as long, managed m 
the same way as the sirloin. Paper the fat and the thin part, or it wil 
done too much, before the thick part in done enough. 

When beef is very fat, it does not require basting ; if very lean.ti 
in greasy paper, and baste frequently and well. 

Common cooks are generally fond of too fierce a fire.and of putting things 

too near to it, 

Slow roasting is as advantageous to the tenderness and flavour of meat 

^T^JaTmefthe weather, and the staler killed the meat is, the less time 
it will require to roast it. 

Meat that is very fat requires more time than other meat. 
In the hands of an expert cook, "alimentary substances are made al- 
most entirely to change their nature, their form, consistence odour sa- 
vour colour chemical composition, etc.; everything is so modified, that i 

often impossible for the most exquisite sense of taste to recognise the 
substance which makes up the basis of certain dishes. The greatest util 
ity of the kitchen consists in making the food agreeable to the senses, and 
rendering it easy of digestion." 

BOILING extracts a portion of the juice of meat, which mixes witfc 
water and also dissolves some of its solids ; the more fusible parts of the 
fat melt out, combine with the water, and form soup or broth, 
loses its red colour, becomes more savoury in taste and smell, and more 
firm and digestible. If the process is continued too long, the meat 
comes indigestible, less succulent, and tough. 

To boil to perfection, it should be done slowly, in plenty of water, re- 
placed by other hot water, as evaporation takes place ; for, if boiled 1 
quickly, the outside becomes tough ; and not allowing the ready trans- 
mission of heat, the interior remains rare. 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOKING. 14,7 

The loss by boiling varies from 6 to 16 per cent. The average loss on 
boiling butcher's meat, pork, hams, and bacon, is 12; and on domestic 
poultry, is 14 J. 

The loss per cent, on boiling salt beef is 15; on legs of mutton, 10; 
hams, 12i ; salt pork, 13J ; knuckles of veal, 8J ; bacon, 0} ; turkeys, 16 ; 
chickens, 13i. 

The established rule as regards time, is to allow a quarter of an hour 
for each pound of meat if the boiling is rapid, and twenty minutes if slow. 
There are exceptions to this ; for instance, ham and pork, which require 
from twenty to twenty -five minutes per pound, and bacon nearly half an 
Lour. For solid joints allow fifteen minutes for every pound, and from 
ten to twenty minutes over ; though of course, the length of time will de- 
pend much on the strength of the fire, regularity in the boiling and size 
of the joint. The following table will be useful as an average of the time 
required to boil the various articles :

The loss by roasting varies, according to Professor Donovan, from 14 
3 oths to nearly double that rate, per cent. The average loss on roasting 
butcher's meat is 22 per cent. ; and on domestic poultry is 20i. 

The loss per cent on roasting beef, viz., on sirloins and ribs together, is 
19 l-6th ; on mutton, viz., legs and shoulders together, 24 4-5ths ; on fore 
quarters of lamb, 22J ; on ducks, 27 l-5th ; on turkeys, 20J ; on geese, 
19| ; on chickens, 14 3-5ths. 

BROILING requires a brisk, rapid heat, which, by producing a greater 
degree of change in the affinities of the raw meat than roasting, generates 
a higher flavour, so that broiled meat is more savoury than roast. The 
surface becoming charred, a dark-coloured crust is formed, which retards 
the evaporation of the juices ; and therefore if properly done, broiled may 
be as tender and juicy as roasted meat. 

BAKING does not admit of the evaporation of the vapours so rapidlv as 
% the processes of broiling and roasting ; the fat is also retained more, 



148 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

and becomes converted by the agency of the heat into an empyreumatic 
oil so as to render the meat less fitted for delicate stomachs, and 
difficult to digest. The meat is in fact, partly boiled in its own confined 
water and partly roasted by the dry hot air of the oven. 

The loss by baking has not been estimated ; and as the time reqmr 
to cook many articles must vary with their size, nature, etc., we have con- 
sidered it better to leave that until giving the receipts for them. 

FRYING is of all methods the most objectionable, from the foods being 
less digestible when thus prepared, as the fat employed undergoes chemi- 
cal changes. Olive oil in this respect is preferable to lard or butter. 

ROA.ST BEEF The tender-loin and first and second cuts off the rack 
are the best roasting pieces-the third and fourth cuts are good. When 
the meat is put to the fire, a little salt should be sprinkled on it, and the 
bony side turned toward the fire first. When the bones get well heate 
through turn the meat, and keep a brisk fire-baste it frequently w h,l< 
roasting There should be a little water put into the dripping pan when 
the meat is put down to roast. If it is a thick piece, allow fifteen min- 
utes to each pound to roast it in- if thin less time will be required. 
BEEF STEAK. The tender-loin is the best piece for broiling a t 
from the round or shoulder clod is good and comes cheaper, 
is not very tender, it should be laid on a board and pounded, before broil 
in* or frying it Wash it in cold water, then lay it on a gridiron, place 
it on a hot bed of coals, and broil it as quick as possible without burning 
it If broiled slow it will not be good. It takes from fifteen to twei 
minutes to broil a steak. For seven or eight pounds of beef, cut up 
quarter of a pound of butter. Heat the platter very hot that the steak 
is to be put on, lay the butter on it, take up the steak, salt and pepper i 
on both sides. Beef steak to be good should be eaten as soon as cookec 
A few slices of salt pork broiled with the steak makes a rich gravy wit 
a very little butter. There should always be a trough to catch 
of the meat when broiled. The same pieces that are good broiled an 
crood for frying. Fry a few slices of salt pork brown , then take ti 
and put in the beef. When brown on both sides, take it up, take the pa: 
off from the fire, to let the fat cool ; when cool, turn in half a teacup c 
water, mix a couple of'teaspoonfuls of flour with a little water stir it into 
the fat, put the pan back on the fire; stir it till it boils up, ther 

over the beef. 

ALAMODE BEEF. The round of beef is the best piece to alamode 
shoulder clod is good, and comes lower ; it is also good stewed wit 
any spices For five pounds of beef, soak about a pound of bread

water till soft, then drain off the water, mash the bread fine, put in a 
piece of butter, of the size of a hen's egg, half a teaspoonful of salt, the 
same quantity of ground cloves, allspica, and pepper, half a nutmeg, a cou- 
ple of eggs, and a tablespoonful of flour mix the whole well together ; 
then cut gashes in the beef, and fill them with about half of the dres- 
sing, put the meat in a bakepan, with lukewarm water enough to cover 
it ; set it where it will stew gently for a couple of hours ; cover it with a 
heated bake-pan lid. When it has stewed a couple of hours, turn the 
reserved dressing on top of the meat, heat the bake-pan lid hot enough 
to brown the dressing, stew it an hour and a half longer. After the meat 
is taken up, if the gravy is not thick enough, mix a teaspoonful or two 
of flour with a little water, and stir it into the gravy ; put in a little but- 
ter, a wineglass of wine, and turn it over the meat. 

BEEF LIVER. Liver is very good fried, but the best way to cook it, is 
to broil it ten minutes with four or five slices of salt pork. Then take it 
out, cut it into small strips together with the pork, put it in a stew-pan, 
with a little water, butter and pepper. Stew it four or five minutes. 

To CORN BEEF. To every gallon of cold water, put a quart of rock 
salt, an ounce of saltpetre, quarter of a pound of brown sugar (some peo- 
ple use molasses, but it is not as good) ; no boiling is necessary. Put the 
beef in the brine. As long as any salt remains at the bottom of the cask 
it is strong enough. Whenever any scum rises, the brine should be scalded, 
skimmed, and more sugar, salt and saltpetre added. When a piece of beef is 
put in the brine, rub a little salt over it. If the weather is hot, cut a gash 
to the bone of the meat, and fill it with salt. Put a heavy weight on the 
beef in order to keep it under the brine. In very hot weather, it is diffi- 
cult to corn beef in cold brine before it spoils. On this account it is good 
to corn it in the pot when boiled. It is done in the following manner ; to 
six or eight pounds of beef, put a teacup of salt ; sprinkle flour on the 
side that is to go up on the table, and put it down in the pot, turn the 
water into the pot after the beef is put in, boil it a couple of hours, then 
turn in more cold water, and boil it an hour and a half longer. 

MUTTON. The saddle is the best part to roast the shoulder and leg 
are good roasted ; but the best mode to cook the latter is to boil it with a 
piece of salt pork. A little rice boiled with it improves the look of it. 
Mutton for roasting should have a little butter rubbed on it, and a little 
salt and pepper sprinkled on it some people like cloves and allspice. 
Put a small piece of butter in the dripping-pan, and baste it frequently. 
The bony side should be turned towards the fire first, and roasted. For 
boiling or roasting mutton allow a quarter of an hour to each pound of 



15 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

meat. The leg is good cut in gashes, and filled with a dressing, and 
baked. The dressing is made of soaked bread, a little butter, salt, and 
pepper, and a couple of eggs. A pint of water with a little butter should 
be put'in a pan. The leg is also good, cut into slices and broiled. It is 
good corned a few days, and then boiled. The rack is good for broiling- 
it should be divided, each bone by itself, broiled quick, and buttered, 
salted and peppered. The breast of mutton is nice baked. The joints 
off the brisket should be separated, the sharp ends of the ribs sawed off, 
the outside rubbed over with a little piece of butter salt it, and put it in 
a bake-pan, with a pint of water. When done, take it up, and thicken 
the gravy with a little flour and water, and put in a small piece of butter. 
A tablespoonful of ketchup, cloves and allspice, improve it, but are not es- 
sential. The neck of mutton makes a good soup. Parsley or celery- 
heads are a pretty garnish for mutton. 

VEAL. The loin of veal is the best piece for roasting. The breast 
rack are good roasted. The breast is also good made into a pot-pie, and 
the rack cut into small pieces and broiled. The leg is nice for frying, and 
when several slices have been cut off for cutlets, the remainder is nice 
boiled with a small piece of salt pork. Veal for roasting should be salted, 
peppered and a little butter rubbed on it, and basted frequently, 
little water in the dripping-pan, and unless the meat is quite fat, a little 
butter should be put in. The fillet is good baked, the bone should be cut 
out and the place filled with a dressing, made of bread soaked soft in cold 
water a little salt, pepper, a couple of eggs, and a tablespoonful of melted 
butter put in-then sew it up, put it in your bake-pan, with about a pint 
of water, cover the top of the meat with some of the dressing. Wher 
baked sufficiently, take it up, thicken the gravy with a 1 
water well mixed, put in a small piece of butter and a littl( 
ketchup, if you like the gravy rich. 

VEAL CUTLETS. Fry three or four slices of pork unt.l brown- 
them up then put in slices of veal, about an inch thick, cut from the 
When brown on both sides, take them up ; stir half a pint of water into 
the -ravy, then mix two or three teaspoonfuls of flour with a little wate 
and "stir it in; soak a couple of slices of toasted bread in the gravy lay 
them on the bottom of the platter, place the meat and pork over it, tl 
turn on the gravy. A very nice way to cook the cutlets is to make a. 
batter with half a pint of milk, an egg beaten to a froth, and flour enoug 
to render it thick. When the veal is fried brown, dip it into the batter, 
then put it back into the fat, and fry it until brown again, 
any batter left, it is nice dropped by the large spoonful into 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOKING. 151 

fried till brown, then laid over the veal. Thicken the gravy and turn it 
over the whole. It takes about an hour to cook this dish. If the meat 
is tough, it will be better to stew it half an hour before frying it. 

CALF'S HEAD. Boil the head two hours, together with the lights and 
feet. Put in the liver when it has boiled an hour and twenty minutes. 
Before the head is done, tie the brains in a bag, and boil them with it ; 
when the brains are done, take them up, season them with salt, pepper, 
butter, and sweet herbs, or spices if you like use this as a dressing for 
the head. Some people prefer part of the liver and feet for dressing 
they are prepared like the brains. The liquor that the calf's head is boiled 
in, makes a good soup, seasoned in a plain way like any other veal soup, 
or seasoned turtle fashion. The liquor should stand until the next day 
after the head is boiled, in order to have the fat rise, and skimmed off. If 
you wish to have your calf's head look brown, take it up when tender, 
rub a little butter over it, sprinkle on salt, pepper, and allspice sprinkle 
flour over it, and put before the fire, with a Dutch oven over it, or in a 
brick oven where it will brown quick. Warm up the brains with a little 
water, butter, salt, and pepper. Add wine and spices if you like. Serve 
it up as a dressing for the head. Calf's head is also good baked. Halve 
it, rub butter over it, put it in a pan, with about a quart of water ; then 
cover it with a dressing made of bread soaked soft, a little butter, an egg, 
and season it with salt, pepper, and powdered mace. Slice up the brains, 
and lay them in the pan with the head. Bake it in a quick oven, and 
garnish it with slices of lemon, or force meat-balls. 

FORCE-MEAT BALLS. Chop a pound or two of veal fine ; mix it with 
one or two eggs, a little butter, or raw pork chopped fine ; season it with 
salt and pepper, or curry powder. Do it up into balls about the size of 
half an egg, and fry them brown. 

CALF'S FEET. Boil them with the head, until tender, then split and 
lay them round the head, or dredge them with flour after they have been 
boiled tender, and fry them brown. If you wish for gravy for them, when 
you have taken them up, stir a little flour into the fat they were fried 
in ; season it with salt, pepper, and mace. Add a little butter and wine 
if you like, then turn it over the feet. 

CALF'S LIVER AND HEART Are good broiled or fried. Some people 
like the liver stuffed and baked. 

A FILLET OF VEAL. Cut off the shank of a leg of veal, and cut gashes 
in the remainder. Make a dressing of bread, soaked soft in cold water, and 
mashed ; season it with salt, pepper, and sweet herbs ; chop a little raw 
pork tine, put it in the dressing, and if you have not pork, use a little but- 



152 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ter instead. Fill the gashes in the meat with part of the dressing, put it 
in the bake-pan, with just water enough to cover it ; put the remainder 
of tbe dressing on top of the meat, and cover it with a heated bake-pan 
lid. For six pounds of veal, allow two hours steady baking. A leg of 
veal is nice prepared in this manner, and roasted. 

LAMB. -The fore and hind quarters are good roasting pieces. Sprinkle 
salt and pepper on the lamb, turn the bony side toward the fire first ; if 
not fat, rub a little butter on it, and put a little in the dripping-pan ; 
baste it frequently. These pieces are good stuffed like a fillet of veal, and 
roasted. The leg is also good, cooked in the same manner ; but it is better 
boiled with a pound of salt pork. Allow fifteen minutes boiling to each 
pound of meat. The breast of lamb is good roasted, broiled, or corned and 
boiled ; it is also good made into a pot-pie. The fore quarter, with the 
ribs divided, is good broiled. The bones of this, as well as all kinds of 
meat, when put down to broil, should first be put towards the fire, and 
browned before the other side is broiled. A little salt, pepper, and butter, 
should be put on it when you take it up. Lamb is very apt to spoil in 
warm weather. If you wish to keep a leg several days, put it in brine. 
It should not be put with pork, as fresh meat is apt to injure it. Lamb's 
head, feet, and heart, are good, boiled till tender, then cut off the flesh 
from the head, cut up the heart, and split the feet in two ; put the whole 
into a pan, with a pint of liquor they were boiled in, together with a little 
butter, pepper, salt, and half a teacup of tomato ketchup ; thicken the gravy 
with a little flour ; stew the whole for a few moments. Pepper-grass or 
parsley is a pretty garnish for this dish. 

LAMB'S FRY. The heart and sweetbread are nice fried plainly, or 
dipped into a beaten egg and fine bread crumbs. They should be fried in 
lard. 

TUKKEY. Take out the inwards, wash both the inside and outside of 
the turkey. Prepare a dressing made of bread soaked soft in cold water 
(the water should be drained from the bread, and the bread mashed fine). 
Melt a small piece of butter, and mix it with the dressing, or else put in 
salt pork chopped fine ; season it with salt and pepper ; add sweet herbs 
if you like. An egg in the dressing makes it cut smoother. Any kind of 
cooked meat is nice minced fine, and mixed with the dressing. If the in- 
wards are used, they ought to be boiled very tender, as it is very difficult 
to cook them through while the turkey is roasting. Fill the crop and 
body of the turkey with the dressing, sew it up, tie up the legs and wings, 
rub on a little salt and butter. Roast it from two to three hours, accord- 
ing to its size ; twenty-five minutes to every pound is a good rule. The 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOKING. 153 

turkey should be roasted slowly at first, and basted frequently. A little 
water should be put into the dripping-pan, when the meat is put down to 
roast. For a gravy to the turkey, take the liquor that the inwards are 
boiled in, put into it a little of the turkey drippings, set it where it will 
boil, thicken it with a little flour and water previously mixed smooth. 
son it with salt, pepper, and sweet herbs if you like. Drawn butter is 
used for boiled turkey. A turkey for boiling should be prepared in the 
same manner as one for roasting. If you wish to have it look white, tie 
it up in a cloth, unless you boil rice in the pot. If rice is used, put in 
two-thirds of a teacup. A pound or two of salt pork boiled with the 
turkey, improves it. If you wish to make a soup of the liquor in which 
the turkey is boiled, let it remain until the next day, then skim off the 
fat. Heat and season it. 

GOOSE. If a goose is tender under the wing, and you can break the 
skin easily by running the head of a pin across the breast, there is no dan- 
ger of it being tough. A goose should be dressed in the same manner, and 
roasted the same length of time as a turkey. 

CHICKENS. Chickens for roasting or boiling should have a dressing 
prepared like that for turkeys. Half a teacup of rice boiled with the 
chickens makes them look white. They will be less liable to break if 
the water is cold when they are put in. A little salt pork boiled 
with the chickens improves them. If you do not boil pork with them 
y<>u will need salt. Chickens for broiling should be split, the inwards 
taken out, and the chicken washed inside and out. Put the bony side 
down on the gridiron, and broil it very slowly until brown, then turn 
it, and brown it on the other side. About forty minutes is required 
to broil a common-sized chicken. For roast chicken, boil the liver and 
gizzards by themselves, and use the water for gravy to the chickens ; 
cut the inwards in slices, and put them in the gravy. 

FRICASSEE. The chickens should be jointed, the inwards taken out, 
and the chickens washed. Put them in a stew-pan with the skin side 
down; on each layer sprinkle salt and pepper ; put in three or four slices 
of pork, just cover them with water, and let them stew till tender. Then 
take them up, mix a little flour and water together, and thicken the liquor 
they were stewed in, add a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, then 
put the chickens back in the stew-pan, and let them stew four or five 
minutes longer. When you have taken up the chickens, soak two or 
three slices of toast in the gravy, then put them in your platter, lay the 
chickens over the toast, and turn the gravy on them. If you wish to 
brown the chickens, stew them without the pork till tender, then fry the 



154 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

pork brown, take it up, put in the chickens, and then fry until a light 
brown. 

PIGEONS. Take out the inwards, and stuff the pigeons with a dressing 
prepared like that for turkeys, lay them in a pot with the breast side 
down. Turn in more than enough water to cover them. When stewed 
nearly tender, put in a quarter of a pound of butter to every dozen of 
pigeons mix two or three teaspoonsful of flour with a little water, and 
stir into the gravy. If you wish to brown them, put on a heated bake-pan 
lid, an hour before they are done, or else take them up when tender, and 
fry them in pork fat. They are very good split open and stewed, with a 
dressing made and wanned up separately with a little of the gravy. Ten- 
der pigeons are good stuffed and roasted. It takes about two hours to 
cook tender pigeons, and three hours tough ones. Roast pigeons should 
be buttered when put to the fire. 

DUCKS Are good stewed like pigeons, or roasted. Two or three 
onions in the dressing of wild ducks takes out the fishy taste they are apt 
to have. If ducks or any other fowls are slightly injured by being kept 
long, dip them in weak salaratus water before cooking them. 

BAKED OR ROAST PIG. A pig for roasting or baking should be small 
and fat. Take out the inwards, and cut off the first joint of the feet, and 
then boil them till tender, then chop them. Prepare a dressing of bread 
soaked soft, the water squeezed out and the bread mashed fine ; season it 
with salt, pepper, and sweet herbs, add a little butter, and fill the pig with ' 
the dressing. Rub a little butter on the outside of the pig, to prevent its 
blistering. Bake or roast it from two hours and a half to three hours 
The pan that the pig is baked in should have a little water put in it. When 
cooked, take out a little 'of the dressing and gravy from the pan, mix it 
with the chopped inwards and feet, put in a little butter, pepper, and salt, 
and use this for a sauce to the pig. Expose the pig to the open air two 
or three minutes before it is put on the table, to make it crispy. 

SWEETBREAD, LIVER, AND HEART. A very good way to cook the sweet- 
bread, is to fry three or four slices of pork till brown, then take them up 
and put in the sweetbread, and fry it over a moderate fire. When you 
have taken up the sweetbread, mix a couple of teaspoonsful of flour with 
a little water, and stir it into the fat let it boil, then turn it over the 
sweetbread. Another way is to parboil them, and let them get cold, then 
cut them in pieces about an inch thick, dip them in the yolk of an egg and 
fine bread crumbs, sprinkle salt, pepper, and sage on them before dipping 
them in the egg ; fry them a light brown. Make a gravy after you have 
taken them up, by stirring a little flour and water mixed smooth in the 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOKING. 155 

fat, and spices and wine if you like. The liver and heart are good cooked 
in the same manner, or broiled. 

TRIPE After being scoured, should be soaked in salt and water seven 
or eight days, changing the water every other day, then boil it till tender, 
which will take eight or ten hours. It is then fit for broiling, frying, or 
pickling. It is pickled in the same manner as souse. 

SAUSAGES. Chop fresh pork very fine, the lean and fat together (there 
should be rather more of the lean than the fat), season it highly with salt, 
pepper, sage, and other sweet herbs, if you like them a little saltpetre 
tends to preserve them. To tell whether they are seasoned enough, do up 
a little into a cake, and fry it. If not seasoned enough, add more season- 
ing, and fill your skins, which should be previously cleaned thoroughly. A 
little flour mixed in with the meat tends to prevent the fat from running 
out when cooked. Sausage-meat is good done up in small cakes and fried. 
In summer, when fresh pork cannot be procured, very good sausage-cakes 
may be made of raw beef, chopped fine with salt pork, and seasoned with 
popper and sage. When sausages are fried, they should not be pricked, 
and they will cook nicer to have a little fat put in the frying-pan with 
them. They should be cooked slowly. If you do not like them very fat, 
take them out of the pan when nearly done, and finish cooking them on a 
gridiron. Bologna sausages are made of equal weight each of ham, veal, 
and pork, chopped very fine, seasoned high, and boiled in casings till ten- 
der, then dried. 

HAM. A ham that weighs ten pounds should be boiled four or five 
hours ; if very salt, the water should be changed. Before it is put on the 
table take, off the rind. If you wish to ornament it, put whole cloves, or 
pepper, in the form of diamonds, over it. The Virginia method of curing 
hams (which is considered very superior), is to dissolve two ounces of salt- 
petre, two teaspoonsful of saleratus, in a salt pickle, as strong as possible, 
for every sixteen pounds of ham. Add molasses in the proportion of a 
gallon to a hogshead of brine, then put in the hams and let them remain 
three or four weeks. Then take them out of the brine, and smoke them 
with the hocks downward, to pi-eserve the juices. They will smoke toler- 
ably well in the course of a month, but they will be much better to remain 
in the smoke-house two or three months. Hams cured in this manner 
are very fine flavoured, and will keep good a long time. 

TONGUES. Cut off the roots of the tongues ; they are not good smoked, 
but they make nice pies. Take out the pipes and veins, boil them till 
tender, mince them fine, season the meat with salt, cloves, mace, and cin- 
namon, put in a little sugar and molasses, moisten the whole with brandy. 



I5G THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

put in a cool place, and it will keep good several months in cold weather, 
and it is good to make pies of at any time, with the addition of apples 
chopped fine, and a little butter melted. For the remainder of the 
tongues, make a brine in the following manner to a gallon of cold water 
put a quart of rock salt, an ounce of saltpetre, quarter of a pound of sugar, 
and couple of teaspoonfuls of blown salt. Put in the tongues, let them 
remain in it a week, and then smoke them eight or ten days. 

CHICKEN PIE. Joint the chickens, which should be young and tender. 
Boil them in just sufficient water to cover them. When nearly tender 
take them out of the liquor, and lay them in a deep pudding-dish, lined 
with pie-crust. To each layer of chicken, put three or four slices of pork, 
add a little of the liquor in which they were boiled, and a couple of ounces 
of butter cut into small pieces sprinkle a little flour over the whole, cover 
it with nice pie crust, and ornament the top with some of your pas- 
try. Bake it in a quick oven one hour. 

BEEF AND MUTTON PIE, Take tender meat, pound it out thin, and broil 
it ten minutes then cut off the bony and gristly parts, season it highly 
with salt and pepper, butter it, and cut it into small pieces. Line a pud- 
ding dish with pastry, put in the meat, and to each layer add a teaspoon- 
ful of tomato ketchup, together with a tablespoonful of water sprinkle 
over flour, and cover it with pie crust, and ornament as you please with 
pastry. Cold roast or boiled beef and mutton make a good pie, by cutting 
them into bits, and seasoning them highly with salt and pepper. Put 
them into a pie dish, turn a little melted butter over them, or gravy, and 
pour in water till you can just see it at the top. 

CHICKEN AND VEAL POT PIE. If the pie is to be made of chickens, joint 
them boil the meat until about half done. Take the meat out of the 
liquor in which it was boiled, and put it in a pot, with a layer of crust to 
each layer of meat, having a layer of crust on the top. The meat should 
be seasoned with salt and pepper cover the whole with the boiled meat 
liquor. If you wish to have the crust brown, keep the pot covered with 
a heated bake pan lid. Keep a tea kettle of boiling water to turn in as 
the water boils away cold water makes the crust heavy. The crust for 
the pie is good like that made for fruit pies, with less shortening, but 
raised pie crust is generally preferred to any other. It is made in the fol- 
lowing manner mix together three pints of flour, a teacupful of melted 
butter, a teaspoonf ul of salt, then turn in half a teacupful of yeast add 
cold water to make it sufficiently stiff to roll out. Set it in a warm place 
to rise, which will take seven or eight hours, unless brewers' yeast is used. 
When risen, roll it out and cut it into small cakes. Potato pie crust is 



IXSTKVCTIOXS FOR COOKIXG. 

very nice. To make it, boil eight or nine small potatoes, peel and mash 
them fine, mix with them a piece of butter, of the size of a hen's eo-o- 

OO* 

1 1',- 1 spoonful of salt, a tumblerful of milk and flour to render it of the 
right consistency to roll out. When rolled out, cut them into cakes, and 
put them with the meat. If you happen to have unbaked wheat dough, 
very good crust may be made of it, by working into it a little lukewarm 
melted butter. Let it remain, after you have rolled and cut it into cakes, 
about ten or fifteen minutes, before putting it with the meat. 

WARMED-OVER MEATS. Boiled or roasted veal makes a nice dish, chop- 
ped fine, and warmed up, with just sufficient water to moisten it, and a 
little butter, salt, and pepper added. A little nutmeg and the grated rind 
of a lemon improve it none of the white part of the lemon should be 
used. When well heated through, take it up on a platter, and garnish it 
with a couple of lemons cut in slices. Fresh or corned beef is wood 
minced fine, with boiled potatoes, and warmed up with salt, pepper, and a 
little water add butter, just before you take ijt up. Some people use the 
gravy that they have left the day before, for the meat, but it is not as 
good when warmed over, and there is no need of its being wasted, as it 
can be clarified, and used for other purposes. Boiled onions, or turnips, 
are good mixed with mince-meat, instead of potatoes. Veal, lamb, and 
mutton are good cut into small strips, and warmed with boiled potatoes 
cut in slices, pepper, salt, a little water add butter just before you take 
it up. Roast beef and mutton, if not previously cooked too much, are nice 
cut in slices, and just scorched on a gridiron. Meat, when warmed over, 
should be on the fire just long enough to get well heated through if on 
the'fire long, most of the juices of the meat will be extracted, and render 
it very indigestible. Cold fowls are nice jointed, and wanned with a little 
water, then taken up and fried in butter till brown. A little flour should 
be sprinkled on them before frying. Thicken the water that the fowls 
were warmed in add a little salt, pepper, and butter, and turn it over 
the fowls. 

DRAWN BUTTER Mix two or three teaspoonsful of flour with a little 
cold water stir it till free from lumps, thin it, and stir it into half a pint 
of boiling water let it boil two or three minutes, then cut up about a 
quarter of a pound of butter into small pieces, and put it with the flour 
and water set it where it will melt gradually. If carefully mixed, it 
will be free from lumps if not, strain it before it is put on the table. If 
the butter is to be eaten on fish, cut up several soft boiled eggs into it. 
A little curry powder sprinkled into it, will convert it into curry sauce. 



158 THE HOME, FAEM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

BURNT BUTTER. Put a couple of ounces of butter into a frying pan- 
set it on a fire when of a dark brown colour, put in half a teacupful of 
vinegar, a little pepper and salt. This is nice for fish, salad, or eggs. 

ROAST MEAT GRAVY. Meat, when put down to roast, should have about 
a pint of water in the dripping-pan. A little while before the meat is 
done, stir up the drippings, put it in a skillet, and set it where it will boil. 
Mix two or three teaspoonfuls of flour smoothly with a little water, and 
stir it in the gravy when it boils. Lamb and veil require a little butter 
in the gravy. The gravy for pork and geese should have a little of the 
dressing and sage mixed with it. If you wish to have your gravies look 
dark, scorch the Hour that you thicken them with, which is easily done by 
putting it in a pan, setting it on a few coals, and stirring it constantly till 
it is a dark brown colour, taking care that it does not burn. Enough can 
be burnt at once to last a long time. 

SAUCE FOR COLD MEAT, FISH, OR SALAD. Boil a couple of eggs three 
minutes ; then mix it with, a mustard-spoonful of made mustard, a little 
salt, pepper, half a tea-cup of salad oil or melted butter, and half a tea-cup 
of vinegar. A table-spoonful of ketchup improves it. 

WINE SAUCE FOR VENISON OR MUTTON. Warm half a pint of the drip- 
pings or liquor the meat was boiled in ; mix a couple of teaspoonsful of 
scorched flour with a little water, and stir it in when the gravy boils. 
Season it with salt, pepper, and cloves ; stir a tablespoonful of cuiTant 
jelly in, and, just before you take it from the fire, half a tumbler of wine. 
Many people prefer melted currant jelly to any other sauce for venison or 
mutton. 

OYSTER SAUCE. Take the juice of the oysters, and to a pint put a 
couple of sticks of mace, a little salt and pepper. Set it on the fire ; when 
it boils, stir in a couple of teaspoonsful of flour, mixed with milk. When 
it has boiled several minutes, stir in half a pint of oysters, a piece of but- 
ter of the size of a hen's egg. Let them scald through, then take them up. 

WHITE CELERY SAUCE FOR BOILED POULTRY. Take five or six heads 
of celery, cut off' the green tops, cut up the remainder into small bits, and 
boil it tender in half a pint of water; mix two or three teaspoonfuls of 
flour smoothly with a little milk ; then add half a teacup more of milk, 
stir it in, add a small lump of butter and a little salt. When it boils take 
it up. 

BROWN SAUCE FOR POULTRY. Peel two or three onions, cut fflem in 
slices, flour and fry them brown in a little butter ; then sprinkle in a little 
flour, pepper, salt, and sage ; add half a pint of the liquor the poultry was 



IXSTIU't TIDXS FOR C'OOKIXG. 159 

boiled in, and a tablespoonful of ketchup. Let it boil ; then stir in half a 
wineglass of wine if you like. 

SAVOURY JELLY FOR COLD MEAT. Boil lean beef or veal till tender. If 
you have any beef or veal bones, crack and boil them with the meat (they 
should be boiled longer than the meat,) together with a little salt pork, 
sweet herbs, and pepper and salt. When boiled sufficiently, take it off. 
strain it, and let remain till the next day ; then skim off the fat, take up 
the jelly, and scrape off the dregs that adhere to the bottom of it ; put in 
the whites and shells of several eggs, several blades of mace, a little wine 
and lemon juice ; set it on the fire, stir it well till it boils, then strain it 
till clear through a jelly bag. 

CHICKEN SALAD. Boil a chicken that weighs not more than a pound 
and a half. When very tender take it up, cut it in small strips, and 
make the following sauce, and turn over it : Boil four eggs three minutes ; 
then take them out of the shells, mash and mix them with a couple of 
tablespoonsful of olive oil or melted butter, two-thirds of a tumbler of vin- 
egar, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, 
and essence of celery if you have it if not, it can be dispensed with. 

APPLE AND CRANBERRY SAUCE. Pare and quarter the apples if not 
tart, stew them in cider if tart enough, stew them in water. When 
stewed soft, put in a small piece of butter, and sweeten it to the taste with 
sugar. Another way, which is very good, is to boil the apples, without 
paring them, with a few quinces and molasses, in new cider, till reduced 
to half the quantity. When cool, strain the sauce. This kind of sauce 
will keep good several months. It makes very good plain pies, with the 
addition of a little cinnamon or cloves. To make cranberry sauce nothing 
more is necessary than to stew the cranberries till soft, then stir in sugar 
and molasses to sweeten it. Let the sugar scald in it a few minutes. 
Strain if you like it is very good without straining. 

PUDDING SAUCE. Stir to a cream a teacup of butter, with two of brown 
sugar, then add a wineglass of wine or cider ; flavour it with nutmeg, rose- 
water, or essence of lemon. If you wish to have it liquid, heat two- thirds 
of a pint of water, boiling hot, mix two or three teaspoonsful of flour with 
a little water and stir it into the boiling water. As soon as it boils up 
well, stir it into the butter and sugar. 

MUSHROOM KETCHUP. Put a layer of fresh mushrooms in a deep dish, 
sprinkle a little salt over them, then put in another layer of fresh mush- 
rooms and salt, and so on till you get in all the mushrooms. Let them 
remain several days ; then mash them fine, and to each quart put a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of black pepper, and a quarter of a 



jQQ THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

teaspoonful of cloves ; turn it into a stone jar, set the jar in a pot of boil- 
ing water and let it boil two hours, then strain it without squeezing the 
mushrooms. Boil the juice a quarter of an hour, skim it well, let it stand 
a few hours to settle, then strain it off carefully through a sieve, bottle 
and cork it tight. Keep it in a cool place. 

WALNUT KETCHUP. Procure the walnuts by the last of June ; keep them 
in salt and water for a week, then bruise them, and turn boiling vinegar 
on them. Let them remain covered with vinegar for several days, stirring 
up each day ; then boil them a quarter of an hour with a little more 
vinegar, strain them through a thick cloth, so that none of the course par- 
ticles of the walnuts will go through ; season the vinegar highly with 
cloves, allspice, pepper and salt. Boil the whole a few minutes, then bot- 
tle and cork it tight. Keep it in a cool place. 

PLAIN VEAL SOUP. A leg of veil, after enough has been cut off for cut- 
lets, makes a soup nearly as good as calf s head. Boil it with a cup two- 
thirds full of rice, and a pound and a half of pork; season it with salt, 
pepper, and sweet herbs, if you like. A little celery boiled in it gives the 
soup a fine flavour. Some people like onions, carrots, and parsley boiled 
in it. If you wish for balls in the soup, chop veal and a little raw salt 
pork fine ; mix it with a few bread crumbs and a couple of eggs. Season 
it with salt and pepper ; add a little curry powder if you like do it up 
into small balls and boil them in the soup. The veal should be taken up 
before the soup is seasoned. Just before the soup is taken up, put in a 
couple of slices of toast, cut into small pieces. If you do not like your 
soup fat, let the liquor remain till the day after you have boiled the meat, 
and skim off the fat before heating the liquor. The shoulder of veal 
makes a good soup. 

MOCK TURTLE, OR CALF'S HEAD SOUP. Boil the head until perfectly 
tender, then take it out, strain the liquor, and set it away until the next 
day, then skim off the fat, cut up the meat, together with the lights, and 
put it into the liquor, put it on the fire, and season it with salt, pepper, 
cloves, and mace, add onions and sweet herbs if you like : stew it gently 
for half an hour. Just before you take it up, add half a pint of white 
wine. For the balls chop lean veal fine, with a little salt pork, add the 
brains, and season it with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, sweet herbs or curry 
powder, make it up into balls about the size of half an egg, boil part in 
the soup, and fry the remainder, and put them in a dish by themselves. 

BEEF OR BLACK SOUP. The shank of beef is the best part for soup- 
cold roast beef bones and beef steak make very good soup. Boil the shank 
four or five hours in water enough to cover it. Half an hour before the 



IXST1UVTIOXS FOR COOKINTG. 



soup is put on the table, take up the meat, thicken the soup with scorched 
flour mixed with cold water, season it with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, a 
little walnut or tomato ketchup improves it, put in sweet herbs or herb 
spirit if you like. Some cooks boil onions in the soup, but as they are 
very disagreeable to many persons, it is better to boil and serve them up 
in a dish by themselves. Make force meat balls of part of the beef and 
pork, season them with mace, cloves, pepper and salt, and boil them in 
the soup fifteen minutes. 

THICKEN OR TURKEY SOUP. The liquor that a turkey or chicken is 
1 Milled in makes a good soup. If you do not like your soup fat, let the 
liquor remain till the day after the poultry has been boiled in it, then skim 
off' the fat, set it where it will boil. If there was not any rice boiled with 
the meat, put in half a teacupful when the liquor boils, or slice up a few 
potatoes and put in season it with salt and pepper, and sweet herbs, a 
little celery boiled in it improves it. Toast bread or crackers, and put them 
in the soup when you take it up. 

OYSTER SOUP. Separate the oysters from the liquor, to each quart of 
tli.' liquor put a pint of milk or water, set it on the fire with the oysters. 
Mix a heaping tablespoonful of flour with a little water, and stir it into 
tl:e liquor as soon as it boils. Season it with salt, pepper, and a little wal- 
nut or butternut vinegar, if you have it, if not, common vinegar may be 
stituted. Put in a small lump of butter, and turn it as soon as it boils 
up again on to buttered toast cut into small pieces. 

PEA SOUP. If you make your soup of dry peas, soak them over night, 

in a warm place, using a quart of water to each quart of the peas. Early 

next morning boil them an hour. Boil with them a teaspoonful of 

ratus eight or ten minutes, then take them out of the water they were 

king in, put them into fresh water, with a pound of salt pork, and boil 

it till the peas are soft, which will be in the course of three or four hours. 

Green peas for soup require no soaking, and boiling only long enough to 

have the pork get thoroughly cooked, which will be in the course of an 

hour. 

OMELET. Beat the eggs to a froth, and to a dozen of eggs put three 
ounces of finely minced boiled ham, beef, or veal ; if the latter meat is used 
add a little salt. Melt a quarter of a pound of butter, mix a little of it 
with the eggs it should be just lukewarm. Set the remainder of the 
butter on the fire, in a frying or tin pan, when quite hot, turn in the eggs 
beaten to a froth, stir them until they begin to set. When brown on the 
under side, it is sufficiently cooked. The omelet should be cooked on a 
moderate fire, and in a pan small enough to have the omelet an inch thick, 



1(J2 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

When you take them up, lay a flat dish on them, then turn the pan upside 

down. 

POACHED EGGS. Break the eggs into a pan, beat them to a froth, then 
put them into a buttered tin pan, set the pan on a few coals, put in a small 
lump of butter, a little salt, let them cook very slowly, stirring them con- 
stantly till they become quite thick, then turn them on to buttered toast. 
BROILING, BOILING AND FRYING FISH. Fish for boiling or broiling are 
the best the day after they are caught. They should be cleaned when 
first caught, washed in cold water, and half a teacup of salt sprinkled on 
the inside of them. If they are to be broiled, sprinkle pepper on the inside 
of them keep them in a cool place. When fish is broiled, the bars of the 
gridiron should be rubbed over with a little butter, and the inside of the 
fish put toward the fire, and not turned till the fish is nearly cooked 
through, then butter the skin side and turn it over ; fish should be broiled 
slowly. When fresh fish is to be boiled, it should either be laid on a fish 
strainer, or sewed up in a cloth, if not, it is very difficult to take it out of 
the pot without breaking. Put the fish into cold water with the back 
bone down. To eight or ten pounds of fish, put half of a small teacup of 
salt. Boil the fish until you can draw out one of the fins easily most . 
kinds of fish will boil sufficiently in the course of twenty or thirty min- 
utes ; some kinds will boil in less time. Some cooks do not put their fish 
into water till it boils, but it is not a good plan, as the outside gets cooked 
too much, and breaks to pieces before the inside is sufficiently done. Fish 
for frying, after being cleaned and washed, should be put into a cloth to 
have it absorb the moisture. They should be dried perfectly and a little 
flour rubbed over them. No salt should be put on them, if you wish to 
have them brown well. For five or six pounds of fish, fry three or four 
slices of salt pork ; when brown, take them up and if they do not make 
fat sufficient to fry the fish in, add a little lard. When the fish are fried 
enough, take them up ; for good plain gravy, mix two or three teaspoons- 
ful of flour with a little water, 'and stir it into the fat the fish was fried 
in, put in a little butter, pepper, and salt, if you wish to have the gravy 
lich add spices, ketchup, and wine, turn the gravy over the fish. Boiled fibh 
should be served up with drawn butter, or liver sauce. Fish, when put 
on the platter, should not be laid over each other if it can be avoided, as 
the steam from the under ones make those on the top so moist that they 
will break to pieces when served out. 

Great care and punctuality are necessary in cooking fish. If not done 
sufficiently, or if done too much, they are not good. They should be eaten 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOKING. 

as soon as cooked. For a garnish to the fish, use parsley, a lemon, or eggs 
boiled hard, and cut in slices. 

CHOWDER. Fry three or four slices of pork till brown, cut each of your 
fish into five or six slices, flour, and put a layer of them into your pork fat, 
sprinkle on pepper and a little salt add cloves, mace, and sliced onions if 
you like lay on several bits of your fried pork, and crackers previously 
soaked soft in cold water. This process repeat till you get in all the fish, 
then turn on water enough to just cover them put on a heated bake pan 
lid. When the fish have stewed about twenty minutes, take them up and 
mix a couple of teaspoonsful of flour with a little water, and stir it into 
the gravy, also a little butter and pepper. Half a pint of white wine, 
spices, and ketchup, will improve it. Bass and cod make the best chowder' 
black fish and clams make tolerably good ones. The hard part of the 
clams should be cut off and thrown away. 

STUFFED AND BAKED FISH. Soak bread in cold water till soft, drain off 
the water, mash the bread fine, mix it with a tablespoonf ul of melted but- 
ter, a little pepper and salt a couple of raw eggs makes the dressing cut 
smoother add spices if you like. Fill the fish with the dressing, sew it 
up, put a teacup of water in your bake pan, and a small piece of butter, 
lay in the fish, bake it from forty to fifty minutes. Fresh cod, bass, and 
shad, are suitable fish for baking. 

FISH CAKES. Cold boiled fresh fish, or salt codfish, is nice minced fine, 
with potatoes, moistened with a little water, and a little butter put in 
done up into cakes the size of common biscuit, and fried brown in pork 
lat or butter. 

FISH FORCE-MEAT BALLS. Take a little uncooked fish, chop it fine, to- 
gether with a little raw salt pork ; mix it with one or two raw eggs, a'few 
bread crumbs and season the whole with pepper and spices. Add a little 
ketchup if you like, do them up into small balls, and fry them till brown 

CLAMS. Wash and put them in a pot, with just water enough to pre- 
vent the shells burning at the bottom of the pot. Heat them tilfthe shells 
jpen take the clams out of them, and warm them with a little of the clam 
liquor, a little salt, butter, and pepper. Toast a slice or two of bread, soak 
t in the clam liquor, lay it in a deep dish, and turn the clams on 'to it. 
For clam pancakes, mix flour and milk together to form a thick batter 
;ome cooks use the clam liquor, but it does not make the pancakes as light 
is the milk. To each pint of the milk put a couple of eggs and a few clams 
they are good taken out of the shells without stewing, and chopped fine, 
)r stewed, and put into the cakes whole. Very large long clams are good 
out of the shells without stewing, and broiled 



164 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

STEWED OYSTERS. Strain the oyster liquor, rinse the bits of shells off 
the oysters, then turn the liquor back on to the oysters, and put them in 
a stew-pan set them where they will boil up, then turn them on to but- 
tered toast salt, pepper, and butter them to your taste. Some cooks add 
a little walnut ketshup, or vinegar. The oysters should not be cooked until 
just before they are to be eaten. 

To FRY OYSTEES. Take those that are large, dip them in beaten eggs, 
and then in flour or fine bread crumbs fry them in lard, till of a light 
brown. They are a nice garnish for fish. They will keep good for several 
months if fried when first caught, salted and peppered, then put into a 
bottle, and corked tight. Whenever they are to be eaten, warm them in 
a little water. 

OYSTER PANCAKES. Mix equal quantities of milk and oyster juice to- 
gether. To a pint of the liquor when mixed, put a pint of wheat flour, a 
few oysters, a couple of eggs, and a little salt. Drop by the large spoonful 
into hot lard. 

OYSTER PIE. Line a deep pie-plate with pie crust ; fill it with dry pieces 
of bread, cover it over with puff paste ; bake it till a light brown, either in 
a quick oven or bake pan. Have the oysters just stewed by the time the 
crust is done ; take off the upper crust, remove the pieces of bread, put it 
the oysters, season them with salt, pepper, and butter. A little walnut 
ketchup improves the pie, but is not essential cover it with the crust. 
SCALLOPED OYSTERS. Pound rusked bread or crackers fine ; butt 
scallop shells or tins, sprinkle on the bread crumbs, then put in a layer of 
oysters, a small lump of butter, pepper, salt, and a little of the oyster juice ;^ 
then put on another layer of crumbs and oysters, and so on till the shells y 
are filled, havino- a layer of crumbs at the top. Bake them till a light 
brown. 

DIRECTIONS FOR PICKLING. Vinegar for pickling should be good, but 
not of the sharpest kind. Brass utensils should be used for pickling. Theyi 
should be thoroughly cleaned before using, and no vinegar should be allow- 
ed to cool in them, as the rust formed by so doing is very poisonous. Boil 
alum and salt in the vinegar, in the proportion of half a teacup of salt, and 
a tablespoonful of alum, to three gallons of vinegar. Stone and wooden 
vessels are the only kind of utensils that are good to keep pickles in^y 
Vessels that have had any grease in will not do for pickles, as no washing 
will kill the grease that the pot has absorbed. All kinds of pickles should 
be stirred up occasionally. If there are any soft ones among them, they 
should be taken out, the vinegar scalded, and turned back while hot if 
very weak, throw it away and use fresh vinegar. Whenever any scuin 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR COOKING. IGo 

rises, the vinegar needs scalding. If you do not wish to have all your 
pickles spiced, it is a good plan to keep a stone pot of spiced vinegar by 
itself, and put in a few of your pickles a short time before they are to be 
eaten. 

WHEAT BREAD. For six common sized loaves of bread, take three pint^ 
of boiling water, and mix it with five or six quarts of flour. When thor- 
oughly mixed, add three pints of cold water. Stir it till the whole of th-> 
dough is of the same temperature. When lukewarm, stir in half a pint of 
family yeast (if brewer's yeast is used, a less quantity will answer), a ta- 
blespoonful of salt, knead in flour till stiff enough to mould up, and free 
from lumps. The more the bread is kneaded, the better it will be. Cover 
it over with a thick cloth, and if the weather is cold, set it near a fire. To 
ascertain when it has risen, cut it through the middle with a knife -if full 
of small holes like a sponge, it is sufficiently light for baking. It should 
be baked as soon as light. If your bread should get sour before you are 
ready to bake it, dissolve two or more teaspoonsful of saleratus (accord 
to the acidity of it) in a teacup of milk or water, strain it on to the dou . 
work in well then cut off enough for a loaf of bread, mould it up well, 
slash it on both sides to prevent its cracking when baked, put it in a but- 
tered tin pan. The bread should stand ten or twelve minutes in the pa:i 
before baking it. If you like your bread baked a good deal, let it stand 
in the oven an hour and a half. When the wheat is grown, it makes bet- 
ter bread to wet the flour entirely with boiling water. It should remain 
till cool before working in the yeast. Some cooks have an idea that it 
kills the life of the flour to scald it, but it is a mistaken idea it is sweeter 
for it, and will keep good much longer. Bread made in this way is nearly 
as good as that which is wet with milk. Care must be taken not to put 
the yeast in when the dough is hot, as it will scald it, and prevent its 
rising. Most ovens require heating an hour and a half for bread. A brisk 
fire should be kept up, and the doors of the room should be kept shut if 
the weather is cold. Pine and ash, mixed together, or birch wood, is the 
best for heating an oven. To ascertain if your oven is of the right tem- 
perature, when cleaned, throw in a little flour ; if it browns in the coins 
of a minute, it is sufficiently hot ; if it turns black directly, wait several 
minutes before putting in the things that are to be baked. If the oven 
does not bake well, set in a furnace of live coals. 

SPONGE BREAD. For four loaves of bread, take three quarts of wheat 
flour and the same quantity of boiling water; mix them well together. 
Let it remain till lukewarm, then add a teacupful of family, or half a tea- 
cup of distillery yeast. Set it in a warm place to rise. When light, knead 



166 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

in flour till stiff enough to mould up, then let it stand till risen again, be- 
fore moulding it up. 

RYE BREAD. Wet up rye flour with lukewarm milk (water will do to 
wet it up with, but it will not make the bread so good). Pat in the same 
proportion of yeast as for wheat bread. For four or five loaves of bread, 
put in a couple of teaspoonsful of salt. A couple of tablespoonsful of 
melted butter makes the crust more tender. It should not be kneaded as 
stiff as wheat bread, or it will be hard when baked. When light, take it 
out into pans without moulding it up ; let it remain in them about twenty 
minutes before baking. 

BROWN BREAD. Brown bread is made by scalding Indian meal, and 
stirring into it, when lukewarm, about the same quantity of rye flour as 
Indian meal ; add yeast and salt in the same proportion as for other kinds 
of bread. Bake it between two and three hours. 

INDIAN BREAD. Mix Indian meal with cold water, stir it into boiling 
water, let it boil half an hour ; stir in a little salt, take it from the fire, 
let it remain till lukewarm, then stir in yeast and Indian meal to render 
it of the consistency of unbaked rye dough. When light, take it out 
into buttered pans, let it remain a few minutes, then bake it two hours 
and a half. 

POTATO BREAD. Boil the potatoes very soft, then peel and mash them 
fine. Put in salt and a very little butter ; then rub them with the flour ; 
wet the flour with lukewarm water, then work in the yeast and flour till 
stiff to mould up. It will rise quicker than common wheat bread, and 
should be baked as soon as risen, as it turns sour very soon. The potatoes 
that the bread is made of should be mealy, and mixed with the flour in 
the proportion of one-third of potatoes to two- thirds of flour. 

RICE BREAD. Boil a pint of rice till soft ; then mix it with a couple of 
quarts of rice or wheat flour. When cool, add half a teacup of yeast, a 
little salt, and milk to render it of the consistency of rye bread. When 
light bake it in small buttered pans. 

FRENCH ROLLS. Turn a quart of lukewarm milk on to a quart of flour. 
Melt a couple of ounces of butter, and put to the milk and flour, together 
with a couple of eggs, and a teaspoonful of salt. When cool, stir in half 
a teacup of yeast, and flour to make it stiff enough to mould up. Put it 
in a warm place. When light do it up into small rolls ; lay the rolls on 
flat buttered tins ; let them remain twenty minutes before baking. 

BUTTKR BISCUIT. Melt a teacup of butter, mix it with two thirds of a 
pint of milk (if you have not any milk, water may be substituted, but 
the biscuit will not be as nice). Put in a teaspoonful of salt, half a tea- 



IX.STROT10NS FOR COOKIM;. 107 

cup of yeast (milk yeast is the best, see directions for making it) stir in 
flour till it is stiff enough to mould up. A couple of eggs improve the 
biscuit, but are not essential. Set the dough in a warm place ; when 
risen, mould the dough with the hand into small cakes, lay them on flat 
tins that have been buttered Let them remain half an hour before they 
are baked. 

BUTTERMILK BISCUIT. Dissolve a couple of teaspoonfuls of saleratus in 
a teacup of sour milk mix it with a pint of buttermilk, and a couple of 
teaspoonsful of salt. Stir in flour until stiff enough to mould up. Mould 
it up into small cakes and bake them immediately. 

HARD BISCUIT. Weigh out four pounds of flour, and rub three pounds 
and a half of it with four ounces of butter, four beaten eggs, and a couple 
of teaspoonfuls of salt. Moisten it with milk, pound it out thin with a 
rolling-pin, sprinkle a little of the reserved flour over it lightly, roll it up 
and pound it out again, sprinkle on more of the flour this operation con- 
tinue to repeat till you get in all the reserved flour ; then roll it out thin, 
cut it into cakes with a tumbler, lay them on flat buttered tins, cover 
them with a damp cloth to prevent their drying. Bake them in a quick 
even. 

POTATO BISCUIT. Boil mealy potatoes very soft, peel and mash them. 
To four good-sized potatoes put a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, 
and a teaspoonful of salt. When the butter has melted, put in half a pint 
of cold milk. If the milk cools the potatoes, put in a quarter of a pint of 
yeast, and flour to make them of the right consistency to mould up. Set 
them in a warm place ; when risen, mould them up with the hand let 
them remain ten or fifteen minutes before baking them. 

SPONGE BISCUIT. Stir into a pint of lukewarm milk half a teacup of 
melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teacup of family, or a table- 
spoonful of brewers' yeast (the latter is the best) ; add flour till it is a 
veiy stiff batter. When light, drop this mixture by the large spoonful 
on to flat buttered tins, several inches apart. Let them remain a few 
minutes before baking. Bake them in a quick oven till they are a light 
brown. 

CRACKERS. Rub six ounces of butter with two pounds of flour dis- 
solve a couple of teaspoonfuls of saleratus in a wine-glass of milk, and 
strain it on to the flour add a teaspoonful of salt, and milk enough to 
enable you to roll it out. Beat it with a rolling-pin for half an hour,

things are baked sufficiently, take them out, set in the crackers, and let 
them remain till baked hard and crispy. 

CREAM CAKES. Mix half a pint of thick cream with the same quantity 
of milk, four eggs, and flour to render them just stiff enough to drop on 
buttered tins. They should be dropped by the large spoonful several 
inches apart, and baked in a quick oven. 

CRUMPETS. Take three teacups of raised dough, and work into it with 
the hand half a teacup of melted butter, three eggs, and milk to render it 
a thick batter. Turn it into a buttered bake pan, let it remain fifteen min- 
utes, then put 011 a bake pan lid heated so as to scorch flour. It will bake 
in half an hour. 

RICE CAKES. Mix a pint of rice boiled soft with a pint of milk, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and three eggs beaten to a froth. Stir in rice or wheat 
flour till of the right consistency to fry. If you like them baked, add 
two more eggs, and enough more flour to make them stiff enough to roll 
out, and cut them into cakes. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. Mix a quart of buckwheat flour with a pint of 
lukewarm milk (water will do, but is not as good), and a teacup of yeast; 
set it in a warm place to rise. When light (which will be in the course 
of eight or ten hours if family yeast is used ; if brewers' yeast is used 
they will rise much quicker), add a teaspoonful of salt if sour, the same 
quantity of saleratus, dissolved in a little milk and strained. If they are 
too thick, thin them with cold milk or water. Fry them in just fat 
enough to prevent their sticking to the frying pan. 

GREEN-CORN CAKE. Mix a pint of grated green-corn with three table- 
spoonsful of milk, a teacup of flour, half a teacup of melted butter, one 
egg, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Drop tin* 
mixture into hot butter by the spoonful, let the cakes fry eight or ten 
minutes. These cakes are nice served up with meat for dinner. 

INDIAN-CORN CAKE. Stir into a quart of sour or butter-milk a couple 
of teaspoonsful of saleratus, a little salt, and sifted Indian meal to render 
it a thick batter a little cream improves the cake bake it in deep cake 
pans about an hour. When sour milk cannot be procured, boil sweet milk, 
and turn it on to the Indian meal ; when cool put in three beaten eggs to 
a quart of the meal, add salt to the taste. 

INDIAN SLAP JACKS. Scald a quart of Indian meal, when lukewarm 
turn, stir in half a pint of flour, half a teacup of yeast, and a little salt. 
When light fry them in just fat enough to prevent their sticking 
the frying pan. Another method of making them, which is very nice, is 
to turn boiling milk or water on to the Indian meal, in the proportion

of a quart of the former to a pint of the latter, stir in three tablespoons- 
ful of flour, three eggs well beaten, and a couple of teaspoonsful of 
salt, 

JOHNNY CAKES. Scald a quart of sifted Indian meal with sufficient 
water to make it a very thick batter ; stir in two or three teaspoonsful of 
salt, mould it with the hand into small cakes. In order to mould them 
up it will be necessary to rub a good deal of flour on the hands, to pre- 
vent their sticking. Fry them in nearly fat enough to cover them. 
When brown on the under side they should be turned. It takes about 
twenty minutes to cook them. When cooked, split and butter then!. 
Another way of making them which, is nice, is to scald the Indian meal, 
and put in saleratus, dissolved in milk, and salt in the proportion of a 
teaspoonful of each to a quart of meal. Add two or three tablespoonsful 
of wheat flour and drop the batter by the large spoonful into a frying 
pan. The batter should be of a very thick consistency, and there should 
be just fat enough in the frying pan to prevent the cakes sticking to it. 

HOE CAKES. Scald a quart of Indian meal with just water enough tr> 
make a thick batter ; stir in a couple of teaspoonsful of salt, and two 
tablespoonsful of butter ; turn it into a buttered bake pan, and bake it 
half an hour. 

MUFFINS Mix a quart of wheat flour smoothly with a pint and a half 
of luke warm milk, half a teacup of yeast, a couple of beaten eggs, a 
heaping teaspoonful of salt, and a couple of tablespooasful of lukewarm 
melted butter ; set the batter in a warm place to rise : when light, butter 
your muffin cups, turn in the mixture, and bake the muffins till a light 
brown. 

RAISED FLOUR WAFFLES. Stir into a quart of flour sufficiently luke- 
warm milk to make a thick batter the milk should be stirred in gradually 
so as to have it free from lumps put in a tablespoonful of melted butter, a 
couple of beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teacup of yeast : 
when risen, fill your waffle-irons with the batter, bake them on a hot bed 
of coals. When they have been on the fire between two and three min- 
utes, turn the waffle-irons over ; when brown on both sides they are 
sufficiently baked. The waffle-irons should be well-greased with lard, 
and very hot, before each one is put in. The waffles should be buttered 
as soon as cooked, Serve them up with powdered white sugar and 
cinnamon. 

QUICK WAFFLES. Mix flour and cold milk together, to make a thick 
batter. To a quart of the flour put six beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of 



170 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



melted butter, and a teaspoonful of salt. Some cooks add a quarter of a 
pound of sugar, and half a nutmeg. Bake them immediately. 

RICE AVAFFLES. Take a teacup and a half of boiled rice, warm it with 
a pint of milk, mix it smooth, then take it from the fire, stir in a pint of 
cold milk and a teaspooniul of salt. Beat four eggs, and stir them in, 
together with sufficient flour to make a thick batter. 

RICE WAFERS. Melt a quarter of a pound of butter, and mix it with a 
pound of rice flour, a tablespoonful of salt, and a wine glass of wine. 
Beat four eggs, and stir in, together with just cold milk enough to enable 
you to roll them out easily. They should be rolled out as thin as possible, 
cut with a wine glass into cakes, and baked in a moderate oven, on 
buttered flat tins.

DRIVING A SINGLE HORSE. 

'AKING YOUR SEAT. In commencing these instructions,! 
we will suppose your horse to have been harnessed and 
brought to your door. It is of course to be expected that 
the groom has seen to his shoes, his harness, and the axles of 
the wheels ; still no prudent driver would mount a vehicle 
in which was a high-couraged horse, without looking to 
see that the reins were properly fastened to the bit, the 
head-piece properly on, the throat-lash fastened, the tr, 
back-band and belly-band quite as they ought to be, nor 
indeed without giving a look around his horse to see that his shoes werel 
on, which can of course be done without holding up the foot ; and we will| 
here remark, that if it be necessary to see that the main points of your 
harness are right, when you have the advantage of the daylight, it is even 
more necessary that a critical examination take place by night ; this can 
be effected as well by the hand as by the eyes ; and we should advise you 
particularly to observe that the reins are correctly placed, as many acci- 
dents have arisen from their being crossed. Having attended to these 
things, take the reins and whip in your light hand ; then mount the 




DRIVING A SINGLE HORSE. 

vehicle, and transfer the reins to the left hand, one of them (the near 
rein) passing over the upper finger, the other between it and the next ; 
then close the thumb upon them, and they will be firmly grasped in the 
hand. Whilst turning, or when driving a high-couraged horse, and in cri- 
tical situations generally, the right hand must be at all times called to the 
assistance of the left ; thus the reins being grasped as before stated, you 
pass the second and third fingers between them, and loosening your hold 
on the off rein a little, let the right hand have complete control of its 
guidance, still, however, firmly holding both reins in your left. This 
position gives you great power over your horse. 

STARTING. Holding your reins as described, start your horse either by 
your voice or by the reins gently feeling his mouth, but neither pulling at 
it, nor jerking the reins. Many high-couraged horses have been made 
jibbers by the stupidity of a driver. If a young horse's mouth is hurt, by 
the driver checking him every time he starts, he will be sure to incur some 
vice ; the habit of rearing or of jibbing will most probably be the result. 
The learned may say, " Suppose, however, he refuse to start, what then is 
'to be done ? " We reply, have patience, let the groom lead him off, caress 
; him, speak quietly and encourage him to proceed, and if he presses on one 
side, as if he wanted to go round, turn him round, if there be room, and as 
soon as he has his head the right way, give him his liberty, and, \)y the 
voice or the whip, urge him to proceed. Much must here be left to the 
judgment ; a touch with the whip in such circumstances would make some 
horses jib, while it would immediately start others ; some it would be ad- 
visa! ile to urge only with the voice, and to have a person to push the gig 
on, so that the collar should scarcely touch the shoulder in starting. Sup- 
posing there is not room for the horse to turn, and he persists in his attempt 
to do so, we have always found it best in such a case to desire the groom 
to let his head alone, and to go to the side towards which the horse is in- 
clined to turn, and then push against the extreme end of the shaft ; if he 
does this, speaking quietly to him all the time, forty-nine horses out of 
fifty, that are not irreclaimable jibbers, will after a short struggle, proceed. 
The sooner you get rid of a confirmed jibber the better; no quality such 
brute can possess would repay you for the trouble the vice occasions ; 
which is, besides, always a dangerous one. 

THE ROAD. Having started your horse, keep your eyes open, looking 
ell before you, not merely for the purpose of avoiding other carriages, 
jut looking up the road, and on each side of it, so as to notice if there be 
my impediment to your horse's progress ; any loose stones which he might 
read upon, and thereby be thrown down ; any sudden rising or fallings in 



172 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

the road, or any object which might frighten him. Always keep your horse 
well in hand that is, feel his mouth ; if you do not, you are never pre- 
pared for emergencies : if he stumbles, you cannot help him to revover 
his legs ; if he starts, you cannot check him. But in keeping him in hand, 
as it is called, you may still fall into error, for if the horse be very light 
in the mouth, there is a probability that an inexperienced person may so 
check him as not only to impede his progress, but to put him out of tem- 
per ; and as nothing is more difficult for a novice to manage than a very 
light-mouthed horse, when he once takes it in his head to have his own 
way, you must be careful merely to feel his mouth so as to have the reins 
at command, but still not sufficiently tight to check him ; this is called 
driving with a light hand, and indeed is the perfection of driving, when 
it has become so habitual as to have assumed the character of " a style." 

DIFFICULT SITUATIONS FOE YOUNG DEIVEES. 

TUSKING THE BIT AND RUNNING AWAY. Some ill-tempered horses 
will become violent upon being in any manner put out of their way- 
such, for instance, as being suddenly stopped two or three times within a 
short distance, or receiving a sudden cut with the whip ; but instead of 
exhibiting this violence by rearing or kicking, they will seize the bit in 
their mouths, close against the tusk, and run violently to one side of the 
road, as if with the intention of landing you in a ditch, or giving you a 
resting-place in a shop-window. The best mode is to stop them at once 
by a quiet pull, speaking softly, as if nothing were the matter ; and then 
coax them into good temper. If this cannot be done, give them the head 
for a moment (a short one it must be), and after bestowing a violent 
switch across the ears, snatch the reins suddenly towards the side to 
which the horse is bearing, which will probably, from the surprise, disen- 
gage the bit, and enable you almost simultaneously either to pull him up 
or draw him away from the danger. You will observe we have said on 
the side to tvhich he is pressing, for it would be all but impossible to draw 
him to the other ; for such a brute always seizes the bit by the branch or 
side which is next to the place he is running to, knowing or rather 
thinking, you will pull the other rein, in which case the side of the face 
would aid him in resisting your efforts. The remedy for this is a ring 
bit, for it has no branches for the horse to get hold of, and if he merely 
seizes that part of the bit which is in his mouth, a sudden jerk will 
instantly disengage it, that is, if it be done with sufficient decision. 

Frequently, however, a horse tusks the bit, as it is called, with a view 
of bolting ; if you cannot disengage the bit in the way directed, you have 



SITUATIONS FoK YOUNG DKIVKR3. 173 

only to stop him as quickly as you can. Recollect, however, that a con- 
tinual dead pull will never stop a runaway horse, unless indeed you have 
tlir strength of Hercules; his mouth soon becomes callous to the action 
.'!' the sharpest liit. Nor is it proper to keep jerking a horse under such 
circumstances, as that would rather urge him to increase his speed. The 
ordinary mode is to take the reins short in your hands, and then l>y a 
Midden, steady movement of the body backwards, exerting at the saint- 
time all the strength of the arms, endeavour to pull him up ; this, repeated 
t wo or three times, will generally be effectual. Suppose it not to succeed t 
adopt the following plan : Cross the reins in your hand that is, place 
the right rein in the left hand, the left in the right hand take them very 
>hort, and then suddenly put all your strength to them with a sudden jerk 
but continue the pressure, violently sawing them at the same time ; if this 
will not bring the horse to his haunches at the first attempt, let him par- 
tiallv have his head that is, sufficiently slacken your pull to give his 
mouth time to recover its feeling and then repeat the effort. 

STUMBLING AND SLIPPING. If your horse be kept well in hand, you 
will generally be able to keep him from absolutely coming down. You 
will natural!}- put more force to your pull upon his making the stumble, 
;md this jerk, if succeeded by a strong, continuous aid, generally keeps 
him on his legs ; a smart stroke with the whip should follow, to remind 
him that this carelessness is not to be repeated. A horse that is apt to 
-tumble, or even one that from his form is likely to stumble, should not 
only always be kept well in hand, but also be kept alive by now and then 
ug reminded, without actually punishing him, that his driver has a 
whip in his hand. A horse with his head set too forward that is, low 
in the withers is almost sure to come down sooner or later, particularly 
if his fore-legs " stand at aH under him," as it is technically termed that 
is slant a little inward. Stumbling, however, be it remembered, is totally 
distinct from slipping ; wood pavements will give the tyro plenty of 
opportunities of seeing the difference. If a horse slips, a sudden jerk 
would probably throw him down ; in such a case the driver must aid the 
horse by a strong steady hold, letting him, as it were, lean on the bit to 
help himself to stand. It requires some nerve thus to aid the horse with- 
out being induced to jerk him by the suddenness of the slip. 

JIBBING is that sort of obstinacy in a horse which causes him to plant 
his fore-feet upon the ground and refuse to move. If we are asked what 
is the best mode to adopt with a jibber, we say, Patience ! This, how- 
ever, must be qualified by the temper of the horse. Some jibbers (but 
:-ij fnc) maybe started by sudden and severe whipping; ninety -nine 



174 THE HOME, FABM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

times out of a hundred it will render a jibber restive, mischievous, or ob- 
stinate. Experience only can dictate the management of such animals. 
Some will start after waiting for a short time, having their head free ; 
coaxing is generally the best means, and, as before said, have patience, 
and do not be in too great a hurry to start. Some may be started by 
being turned round, and others, by being backed for a short distance. 
Many think it a good plan to punish a jibber when he is once started ; 
our experience proves the contrary, for, depend upon it, he will recollect 
this next time, and will not fail further to exercise your patience for fear 
of the flogging. Kindness and good driving may cure a horse who is not 
a confirmed jibber ; but when once this vice has become habitual, you can 
never depend upon the horse ; as we have said before, get rid of him. 

KICKING. An experienced eye can generally tell if a horse is likely to 
kick, and also when he is about to kick. We, however, always drive 
with a kicking-strap, and would recommend the practice. When a horse 
attempts to kick, you must hold him well in hand, and lay the whip well 
into him about the ears, rating him at the same time with a loud voice ; 
this plan we have generally found effective. 

REARING. Little can be done in harness with a determined rearer. 
When he tries to rear, if you have room, give him half a turn ; this will 
make him move his hind-legs, and will consequently bring him down ; 
you will find a series of turns punish and surprise him more than any- 
thing else. ' When you have got him on the move, with his head the right 
way, you can punish him with the whip, if he is one that you are sure 
you can manage ; if not, you had better leave well alone. With respect 
to rearing in double harness, we will here observe, the best way to act is, 
to push the other horse forward, and soothe the restive one, until you 
have fairly got him on ; you can then punish or not, according to your 
judgment, but not without reference to your ability to manage the 
horses. 

SHYING. Before a horse starts at anything on the side of the road, or 
lying on the road, he usually gives some notice of his intention, by cock- 
ing his ears, and bending his head towards the object. As soon as the 
driver perceives these signs of uneasiness, he should be upon his guard to 
prevent a sudden turn round, or flying to one side, which would evidently 
be dangerous ; and not only on this account should he be attentive, but 
because each time the horse violently shies, the habit is in progress of 
being confirmed. As soon, therefore, as a horse, accustomed to shy, gives 
notice of uneasiness, he should be coaxed up to the object of his terror, so 
that he may perceive its harmlessness ; let him deliberately stand and

view it, let it, if possible, be brought to him, and then replaced in its for- 
mer position ; thus let him be induced to go up to it by care and kindncs- 
before it is passed, and you will generally find that a repetition of this 
practice will greatly improve, if it do not cure him ; but by no means flog 
or force him up to it let him take his time. Some horses have a nasty 
knack of flying on one side in passing, or flying around on meeting a car- 
riage ; care and patience are the remedies, in addition to more work. It 
very frequently arises from playfulness rather than vice ; and giving 
them more work to do will cure this. A experienced hand may force a 
horse forward, under such circumstances, by the reins and whip ; but we 
recommend the tyro rather to slacken his pace upon meeting an object 
that his horse will go round, or attempt to go round at ; by doing this, 
and speaking kindly, the animal will either be soothed or diverted from 
his purpose. 

DRIVING TWO HORSES. 

We have addressed most of our remarks to a person driving a single 
horse, for this reason, that it is much more difficult to drive one horse, 
than it is to drive a pair, that is, if you have sufficient nerve. In almost 
all situations of difficulty, you can make the second horse assist you in 
managing the other ; if the one shies, and will go to the right we will 
suppose it is the near wheeler by opposing the strength of the other to 
him, which you will do by the reins, touching him with the whip on the 
off-side, you will prevent any very great deviation from the straight line. 
Again, if one will not start readily, the other, generally speaking, may be 
made to pull him on ; in this case, never hit the restive horse ; or at any 
rate until your judgment is sufficiently matured to determine whether it 
will do good or harm. Suppose the one tries to run away if he is an ill- 
tempered brute, it may sometimes be advisable not to irritate him by 
hard pulling then all you have to do is to keep back the other, and he 
must shortly be beaten, as he will not only have the carriage and its con- 
tents opposed to him, but the weight and strength of his companion to 
pull against. Sometimes a horse will be awkward in turning a corner, 
here again his companion assists you ; if he turns too quick, the other 
opposes him ; if not sufficiently so, a touch with the whip makes the other 
force him on. Instead of its being more difficult to drive two horses than 
one, as the tyro doubtless imagines, it is, in fact just the reverse, when he 
has obtained sufficient confidence to attempt it. But although it is easier 
to manage two horses than one, it requires much more attention in some 



176 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

respects ; you must continually watch them, or, perhaps, one will do all 
the work while the other is doing nothing. 

THE SEAT. When driving, sit quite straight towards your horses, and 
lather more to the middle than to the off-side of the box-seat. Keep 
your body nearly upright, or inclined a little backward rather than for- 
ward, and your feet well together, extended upwards, and on no account 
doubled under your legs ; a firm seat is indispensable for your own safety 
and that of the friends you may be driving, therefore never sit with your 
feet doubled under you, for a sudden jolting of the carriage, or increase of 
the pace of your horses, may capsize you into the road. Never ride in a 
vehicle that has the wheels secured only by a common linchpin, for acci- 
dents arising from wheels, thus fastened, coming off, are generally of a 
serious character. 

ACCIDENTS. As accidents are usually unforeseen, the suddenness with 
which they arrive is apt to unnerve the rider, and so sure as this be the 
case, his judgment will be at fault. Presence of mind should, therefore, 
be exercised on all occasions of danger. With kicking horses before you 
(unless you are in a gig), the best plan is to let the whip take it out of 
them. With runaways, never think of deserting the box by jumping off", 
for there is a chance of your being able to pull them up, but none of your 
escaping severe contusions, if not broken limbs or loss of life, should you 
throw yourself from the vehicle. 

DOWN HILL. If these are of an ordinary character, we would not 
ise locking the wheel except with a heavy load, or when your horses 
will not hold back ; besides the trouble, locking is a great disadvantage, 
for by letting out your horses when you have passed the pitch of a hill, 
the motion of the carriage takes it half way up an ordinary rise before 
your horses feel the weight, and this, in a day's journey, will be found of 
considerable importance. If your horses will not hold back, or are not 
masters of their load, locking the wheel becomes necessary when the hill 
is long or steep. When the hill is not very steep, and the near edge of 
the road happens to be of a rough, rutty nature, or has gravel or granite 
?trewn upon it, take your near wheel a few inches from the resisting sub- 
>tance, which will supply the additional friction, or bite necessary to check 
the increasing momentum of a downward pace, and obviate the necessity 
of skidding. 

STOPPING. When pulling up, accustom your horses to stop by some 
signal, and draw in the reins equally, unless either of the animals shows 
;i disinclination to obey the notice. Young horses should be stopped very

dually, and eight or ten yards allowed them to pull up in; for they 
are apt to resist attempts to stop them short. 

MATCHING HORSES. Some persons arc particular as to the colour of 
their horses, but it is much more important that their paces and their tem- 
pers should match, than that their colours should be alike ; for if you hav.- 
one slow and the other fast one irritable and nervous, and the other stu- 
pid and obstinate one free, and the other like a lawyer that will not 
move without being paid you are sure to weary out the free, nervous, 
and fast horse, by whipping up the other to his pace; and although you 
may hold him back, you will take as much strength out of him as though 
he was doing all the work. If, therefore, your horses do not match in pace 
and freeness, get rid of the dull one, or depend on it your work will soon 
kill the other ; besides, you can never have any pleasure in driving.

''HE game of Lacrosse has, perhaps, attracted more attention 
amongst young men than any other field sport that has 
ever been introduced to their notice. 

That this game, comparatively unknown until within 
the past few years, should have so suddenly become pop- 
ular, seems almost a wonder. If ever any game has been 
persecuted, abused, or belied by envious rivals, that game 
has certainly been Lacrosse ; and yet, in spite of all oppo- 
sition and ridicule it has received from the adherents of 
older established sports in spite of its being declared unscientific, and 
not at all gentlemanly, by those whose notions were rather prudish this 
game has, on account of its own intrinsic merits, not only been adopted 
by Young Canada as the National Game of the Dominion, but has also 
won its way high into the favour of athletics, both in England and the 
United States. 

It is affirmed by its opponents that there is no science in the game, it is 
all hard work, and is injurious to the constitution. A good player seldom 
hurts himself ; it is only the novice who does the hard work, and gets no 
return for it. Lacrosse is yet in its infancy; the fine points in the game 
are only now becoming apparent. But the day will come when the pub- 
lic verdict on it, even as a scientific game, will be materially changed, and 
its opponents be obliged to confess that, measured only by their scientific 
standards, it will take its place as king of out-door sports. 

Lacrosse has so many advantages over other games that, perhaps, it will 
not be out of place to mention a few of them. It is the cheapest of all 
games. It requires no pads, gauntlets, or other expensive equipments. A 
single lacrosse stick, and simple running gear is all that is required for 
action. It developes the muscles better than any sport we know of. The 
muscular action is confined to no particular part, as in rowing, skating, or 
football it exercises equally the arms, legs and body, and at the same 
time there is sufficient excitement about it to make it the most fascinat- 
ing of games. It develops self-reliance, and awakens the energies of all 
who would excel in it. It is conducive to temperance and sobriety, for 



THE ORIGINAL GAME. 

no young man can belong to a "first twelve;' or be a crack " play,, w l,,, 
does not attend to his way of living, and shun entirely the flowing bowl 
or other vices of a more questionable character. It is so simple to look 
at that anyone can readily master its first principles in a few minutes but 
to excel at it requires careful and steady practice, which not only acts 
healthfully on the body, but exercises an exhilarating effect upon the 
mind. 

The game is always alive, and no player need ever complain that he has 
not had innings enough. As a matter of fact, it is nearly all innings, if a 
player only chooses to make it so. 

THE OEIGINAL GAME. 

Lacrosse, or Bagataioay, as it was originally called, is an Indian game 

and was used by them not only as a recreation, but also as a training 

school in which to quicken and strengthen the body, and accustom tlu-i'r 

young warriors to close combat so as to fit them for the sterner realiti.-s 

the war path. It was a sport emphatically suited to the nature and 

levelopment of the young Indian warriors, and it is not surprising as au 

old writer tells us, that amongst some of the tribes it became " the chief 

object of their lives." 

The original game had no fixed or definite rules by which it was ov- 
erned : each tribe laid down laws of its own, but in all cases it was mind 
which was made subservient to matter, instead of vice ver*. 

As far back as we can trace, we find the original Crosse to have been 
)f a very different shape to that in present use. Those of the Choctaws 
Chippewas, Oherokees and Creeks were about three feet long, bent into 
an oblong hoop, at one end large enough to hold the ball. Those of the 
Sacs, Sioux, Obijways, Dacotahs, Six Nations, Poutawatamies, and most 
other tribes, were about the same length, but the hoop was circular None 
of the original sticks were over four feet long. The net-work of the 
oblong hoop was generally three inches long and two wide ; that of the 
round hoops twelve inches in circumference. The former was literally 
net-work, but the latter was simply two strings tied in the centre and 
fastened m four places to the hoop; and both were sufficiently ba^ed to 
catch and hold the ball. The net-work or strings were origmaUjof wot- 
tup (the small roots of the spruce tree used for sewing bark canoes) ; after- 
wards they were made of deerskin. Among the Chocktaws, Cherokees 
Creeks, fee., each player carried two sticks, one in each hand The ball 
was caught and carried between them. There was considerable difference 
n the play with one stick and two-the former by far the most difficult 



180 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The manner of picking up was peculiar, owing to its shape. As the ball 
lay on the ground, it was almost covered with the hoop, and by a pecu- 
liar twist of the wrist and arm from left to right, scooped up in one mo- 
tion. The ball was thrown from it by a jerk, and could not be pitched so 
far as with the present stick, as it received but little impetus. The 
Indians dodged very little, except when the ball was caught or picked up 
in a crowd, and dodging was necessary. This seems the more remarkable 
when we consider the shape of the stick, and the peculiar facilities for 
dodging afforded by the concavity of the netting, and the smallness of 
the hoop which retained the ball. 

The original Ball was about the size of a tennis ball though differing 
among the tribes, and was first made of deerskin or rawhide, stuffed with 
hair, and sewed with sinews. Some of the tribes used a heavy wooden 
ball generally a knot while others improvised balls of the bark of the 

pine-tree. 

The earliest Goal was any marked rock or tree that happened to be 
convenient. At grand matches, however, they were more particular, and 
used for each goal a single pole or stake, eight feet high and two inches 
in diameter, or two poles as at present. The distance between the gaols 
varied in proportion to the number of players, from five hundred yards to 
a mile and a half and more. Where only one flag pole was used, it was 
counted game by merely putting the ball past the line of the pole 
although in some tribes the pole was required to be struck with the ball 
before it could be counted game. 

The Umpires were generally the old medicine men of the tribe, whose 
decision was in all cases final. 

The Dress of the players was generally as primitive as can be imagined 
wearing only a light breech-cloth, and on grand occasions painting 
their faces and bodies, and decorating themselves with fantastic bead- 
work and feathers of various colours. Some tribes wore a curious kind 
of tail fastened to the small of the back, made of white horse-hair, or 
dyed porcupine quills, and a mane or neck of horse-hair dyed various 

colours. 

Their matches were not decided like ours by the winning of three 
ames out of five, but sometimes lasted for days together. They were 
really trials of strength and endurance as well as of skill.

RULE I. THE CROSSK. 

Section 1. The Crosse may be of any length to suit the player; woven 
with cat-gut, which must not be bagged. ("Cat-gut" is intended to mean 
raw-hide, gut, or clock-string ; not cord or soft leather). The netting must 
be flat when the ball is not on it. In its widest part the crosse shall not 
exceed one foot. A string must be brought through a hole at the side of 
the tip of the turn, to prevent the point of the stick catching an opponent's 
crosse. A leading-string resting upon the top of the stick may be used, 
but must not be fastened, so as to form a pocket, lower down the stick 
than the end of the length-strings. The length-strings must be woven to 
within two inches of their termination, so that the ball cannot catch in the 
meshes. 

Sec. 2. No kind of metal, either in wire or sheet, nor screws or nails, t<> 
stretch strings, shall be allowed upon the crosse. Splices must be made 
either with string or gut. 

Sec. 3. Players may change their crosses during a match. 

RULE II. THE BALL. 

The Ball must be India-rubber sponge, not less than eight, nor more 
than nine inches in circumference. In matches it must be furnished by 
the challenged party. 

RULE III. THE GOALS. 

The Goals must be at least 125 yards from each other, and in any posi- 
tion agreeable to the captains of both sides. The top of the flag-poles must 
be six feet above the ground, including any top ornament, and six feet 
apart. In matches they must be furnished by the challenged party. 

RULE IV. THE GOAL CREASE. 

No attacking player must be within six feet of either of the flag-poles, 
unless the ball has passed Cover-point's position on the field. 



182 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

RULE V. UMPIRES. 

Section 1. There shall be one Umpire at each Goal. They shall be dis- 
interested parties, whose reputation for truthfulness and integrity are well 
known and above suspicion. They shall not be members of either club 
engaged in a match, nor shall they be changed during its progress without 
the consent of both Captains. 

Sec. 2. Their jurisdiction shall last during the match for which they are 
appointed. They shall not change goals during a match. 

Sec. 3. No Umpire shall, either directly or indirectly, be interested in 
any bet upon the result of the match. No person shall be allowed to speak 
to an Umpire, or in any way distract his attention, when the ball is near 
or nearing his goal. 

Sec. 4. They shall stand behind the flags when the ball is near or near- 
ing their goal. In the event of game being claimed, the Umpire at that 
goal shall at once decide whether or not the ball has fairly passed through 
the flags, his decision simply being " game " or " no game," without com- 
ment of any kind. He shall not be allowed to express an opinion, and his 
decision shall in all cases be final, without appeal. 

Sec. 5. In the event of the Field Captains failing to agree upon the 
Umpires, after three nominations in accordance with this rule have been 
made by each party, it shall be the duty of the Referee to appoint one or 
more Umpires, as may be required, who shall not be one of the persons 
objected to, who must be duly qualified as required by this rule. In 
championship matches they shall be appointed the day previously. 

Sec. G. If, after the commencement of a match, it becomes apparent 
that either Umpire, on account of partizanship, bets on the match, or any 
other cause, is guilty of giving unjust decisions, the side offended against 
may enter a protest with the Referee against his conduct, and ask for his 
immediate removal. After hearing the evidence on both sides, the Referee 
shall decide whether he shall be dismissed or continue in office. If dis- 
missed, the Referee shall at once appoint another Umpire to act in his 
stead. Any decision, however, which he may have given previous to his 
dismissal shall hold good. 

RULE VI. REFEREE. 

Section 1. The Referee shall be selected by the Captains ; and in the 
case of " Championship " matches, must be appointed at least one day be- 
fore the match. When the Captains have agreed upon a Referee, they shall

terested in any bet upon the result of the match. In the event of the Field 
< 'aptains failing to agree upon a Referee the day previous to a match, it 
shall be the duty of the President of the National Amateur Lacrosse As- 
-ociation, or in his absence from the country, or owing to the impossibility 
of his being communicated with, the Vice-President, upon being duly noti- 
fied, to appoint a Referee to act during the match ; such Referee, however, 
not to be one of the number proposed by either of the competing clubs. 

Sec. 2. Before the match begins, the Referee shall see that properly 
qualified Umpires are selected, as provided for in Rule V. He shall also 
obtain from each of the Captains a declaration and list of their team, and 
shall satisfy himself that the players are lnn,t ji<l<' members of the team 
they represent, in accordance with Sec. 1, Rule IX. All disputed points 
and matters of appeal that may arise during his continuance in office 
shall be left to his decision, which, in all cases, must be final, without 
appeal. 

Sec. 3. Before the match begins, he shall draw the players up in 
lines, and see that the regulation respecting the ball, crosses, spiked soles, 
etc.. are complied with. He shall also see that the regulations respecting 
the goals are adhered to. He shall know before the commencement of a 
match the number of games to be played, time for stopping, and any other 
arrangements that may have been made by the Captains. He shall have 
the power to suspend at any time during the match any player infringing 
these laws the game to go on during such suspension. 

Sec. -4. When " foul " has been called by either Captain, the Referee 
shall immediately cry " time," after which the ball must not be touched by 
either party, nor must the players move from the position in which they 
happen to be at the moment, until the Referee has called "play." If a 
player should be in possession of the ball when " time " is called, he must 
drop it on the ground. If the ball enters goal after " time " has been 
called, it shall not count. 

Sec. 5. The jurisdiction of the Referee shall not extend beyond the 
match for which he is appointed ; and he shall not decide in any matter 
involving the continuance of a match beyond the day on which it is 
played. The Referee must be on the ground at the commencement of 
and during the match. At the commencement of each game, and after 
" fouls " and "balls out of bounds," he 'shall see that the ball is properly

faced, and, when both sides are ready, shall call " play." He shall not 
express an opinion until he has taken the evidence on both sides. After 
taking the evidence, his decision, in all cases must be final. Any side 
rejecting his decision, by refusing to continue the match, shall be declared 
losers. 

Sec. 6. When game is claimed and disallowed, the Referee shall order 
the ball to be faced for, from where it is picked up ; but in no case must 
it be closer to the goals than ten (10) yards in any direction. 

RULE VII. CAPTAINS. 

Captains to superintend the play shall be appointed by each side pre- 
viously to the commencement of a match. They shall be members of the 
club by whom they are appointed, and no other. They may or may not 
be players in the match ; if not, they shall not carry a crosse, nor shall 
they be dressed in Lacrosse uniform. They shall select Umpires and 
Referees, as laid down in these Rules, toss for choice of goals, and they 
alone shall be entitled to call " foul " during a match. They shall report 
any infringement of the laws during a match to the Referee. (2) Before 
the commencement of a match, each Captain shall furnish the Referee with

n 



one of the old-fashioned to begin upon; these may be 
got at a reasonable price, as many have been discarded for 
the modern ones. They are called " practicers," or, more 
familiarly, " bone-shakers." In learning to ride, it is ad- 
visable to have a competent teacher, who cannot only show 
what is wanted, but can also put the beginner in the way 
of doing it himself; but as many may be unable, from dis- 
tance or other causes, to avail themselves of this kind of 
assistance, the following instructions are intended for those 
who are thus thrown upon their own resources. Of course it is necessary 
to have recourse to a friendly arm, and there may be many cases in which 
two friends are desirous to learn the bicycle, and can give mutual help. 



]<)2 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The old-fashioned bicycle is of this construction, that is, of moderate 
height and the most solid build, and altogether very different from its 
latest development, with its enormous driving-wheel and general lightness 
of make. These machines, with comparatively little difference in the 
height of the wheel, are best for beginners, as, being lou; the getting on 
and off is easier and safer, and they are in every way adapted for the pur- 
pose ; and it is only when tolerable command of this kind is acquired, that 
the modern large-wheeled bicj-cle may be adventured with fair prospect of 
success. 

But even with these some discrimination is necessary. In choosing a 
machine on which to begin practising, we strongly advise the learner to 
select one of the size suitable to his height, as, if it is too small, his knee* 
will knock against the handles, and if too large, his legs will not be long 
enough fairly to reach the throw of the crank. We know it is not un- 
common to begin with a boy's machine, and on an inclined plan ; but the 
benefit of these is very doubtful, unless you are totally without help, and 
have no one to lend you a helping hand. 

The best guide in measuring oneself for a bicycle to learn on is, we con- 
sider, to stand by its side and see that the saddle is in a line with the hips. 
The point of the saddle should be about six inches from the upright which 
supports the handles ; for if the saddle is placed too far back, you decrease 
your power over the driving-wheel, especially in ascending a hill. 

When you have secured a good velocipede, well suited to your size, you 
will find it useful to practise wheeling it slowly along while holding the 
handles. While thus leading it about, of course you will soon perceive the 
fact that the first desideratum is to keep the machine perfectly upright, 
which is done by turning the handles to the right or left when there is 
any inclination to deviate from the perpendicular. If inclining to the 
right, turn the wheel in the same dircetion, and vice versa, as it is only the 
rapidly advancing motion that keeps it upright, on the principle of the 
boy's hoop, which, the faster it rolls, the better it keeps its perpendicular, 
and which, when losing its momentum, begins to oscillate, and finally must 
fall on one side or the other. 

Now for the 

FIEST LESSON. 

Having become accustomed to the motion of the machine, and well stu- 
died its mode of travelling, the next thing is to get the assistant to hold it 
steady while you get astride, and then let him slowly wheel it along. 

Do not attempt at first to put your feet on the treadles, but let them 
han<* down, and simply sit quiet on the saddle, and take hold of the han-

dies, while tin- assistant moves you slowly along, with one hand on your 
arm and the other on the end of the spring. 

It is hardly necessary to say that the best place to learn is a large room 
or gallery, with smooth-boarded floor or flag-stone pavement. 

Now, directly you are in motion you will feel quite helpless, and exper- 
ience a sensation of being run away with, and it will seem as if the 
machine were trying to throw you off; but all you have to do is to keep 
the front wheel straight with the back wheel by means of the handles, 
and the assistant will keep you up and wheel you about for a quarter of 
an hour or so, taking rest at intervals. When you want to turn move the 
handle so as to turn the front wheel in the direction required, but avoid 
turning too quickly, or you will fall on the reverse way. 

Observe that in keeping your balance, all is done by the hands guiding 
th- front wheel. Do not attempt to sway your body, and so preserve 
your balance, but sit upright, and if you feel yourself falling to the left, 
turn the wheel to the left ; that is to say, guide the machine in the direc- 
tion in which you are falling, and it will bring you up again ; but this 
must be done the same moment you feel any inclination from the perpen- 
dicular. Do not be violent and turn the wheel too much, or you will 
overdo it, and cause it to fall the other wav. 

Practise guiding the machine in this way until you feel yourself able to 
be left to yourself for a short distance, and then let the assistant give you 
a push, and leaving his hold, let you run by yourself for a few yards be- 
fore you incline to fall. Should you feel that you are losing your balance, 
stretch out the foot on the side on which you incline, so that you mav 
pitch upon it, and thus arrest your fall. 

SECOND LESSON. 

Having pretty well mastered the balancing and keeping the machine 
straight, you may now take a further step, and venture to place your feet 
on the treadles, and you will now find the novel movement of the legs up 
and down liable to distract your attention from the steering or balancing ; 
but after a few turns you will get familiarized with the motion, and find 
this difficulty disappear ; and it will seem within the bounds of possibility 
that you may some time or other begin to travel without assistance. 

Of course, in this and the former lesson, some will take to it more quickly 
than others, and the duration of the lessons must depend on the learner 
himself, and the amount of mechanical aptitude he may be gifted with. 
Some we have known to take six times as much teaching as others.

THIKD LESSON. 

Now having in the first lesson ridden with the feet hanging down, and 
n the second with them on the treadles, in the third lesson you should be 
able to go along for a short distance, working the treadles in the usual 



in 



course when we speak of the first and second lessons, we do not 
mean that after practising each of them once you will be able, of necess 
to ride at the third attempt; although we have taught some who seemed 
to take to it all at once : but that these are the progressive steps in lean 
in- to ride and you must practise each of them until tolerably proficient. 
When you are sufficiently familiar with the working of the treadles 
while held by the assistant, it depends entirely on yourself, and the 
amount of confidence you may possess, to determine the time at which he 
may let go his hold of you, and you may begin to go alone ; but of course 
for some time it will be advisable for him to walk by your side, to catch 
you in case of falling. When you have arrived at this stage, you only re- 
quire practice to make a good rider, and the amount of practice taken i; 
o-enerally a guide to the amount of skill gained. 

' To GET ON AND OFF. Having now learned to ride the velocipede wit 
out assistance, we will now proceed to getting on and off in a respectable 
manner in case you have not a step, which all modern machines are now 
provided with. The proper way is to vault on and off, which is the eas- 
iest way of all, when you can do it, but it certainly requires a h 

courage and skill. 

At first it may be, from want of confidence in yourself, you will jump 
at the machine and knock it over, both you and it coming down. 
what is required to be done is, to stand on the ?e/-hand side of the 
bicycle and throw your right leg over the saddle. Stand close to the ma- 
chine holding the handles firmly ; then run a few steps with i 
sufficient momentum, and then, leaning your body well over the handl 
and throwing as much of your weight as you can upon them, with a sligb 
jump throw your right leg over the saddle. 

This may sound formidable, but it is in reality no more than mos 
equestrians do every time they mount, as the height of the bicycle 
be cleared is little more than that of the horse's back when the foot is 
the stirrup, only the horse is supposed to stand quiet., and therefore yoi 
can jump with a kind of swing. 

You must be very careful that while running by the side you k eep t 
machine perfectly upright, particularly at the moment of jumping. 



THIRD LESSON. 195 

haps at first you will vault on, forgetting to keep the machine quite per- 
pendicular, and as an inevitable consequence you will come to the ground 
again, either on your own side, or, what is worse, you may go right over 
it. and fall with it on the top of you on the other side. 

Of cour.se it is much better to have an assistant with you at your first 
attempts at vaulting, and it is good practice to let him hold the machine 
steady while you vault on and off as many times as you can manage. You 
must not forget to put all the weight you can on the handles, and although 
at first this seems difficult, it is comparatively easy when the knack is 
acquired. 

You will not attempt any vaulting until you can manage the machine 
pretty well when you are on, up to which time the assistant should help 
you on and set you straight. 

To get on with the help of the treadle is a very neat and useful me- 
thod, but requires considerable more practice than vaulting. 

Stand with the left foot on the treadle, and take a slight sprint* or 
" beat" from the ground with the right foot, give the machine a good send 
forward, of course following it yourself, and with a rise bring the right 
foot over to the saddle. The secret of this movement is that you put as 
little weight as you can on the treadle, merely following the movement, 
which has a tendency to lift you, and keep the greater part of your weight 
on the liaiulles. 

You may mount the bicycle in another way, and that is by running by 
its side, and watching the time when one of the treadles is at its lowest, 
then place your foot upon it, and as it comes up, the momentum thus 
gained will be sufficient to lift you quite over on to the saddle. In this 
movement also, as in most others, it is much better to have assistance at 
first. 

To vault off, you have merely to reverse all the movements just de- 
scribed. 

Another capital way of alighting from the machine while in motion is 
to throw the right leg over the handles. You hold the left handle firmly, 
and raise your right leg over and into the centre of the handles, previous- 
ly raising your right hand to allow the leg to pass under. Then lifting 
your left hand for the same purpose, you will be able to bring your leg 
over into a side-sitting posture, and drop to the ground with the same 
movement. 

But at this time pay strict attention to the steering, and take care never 
to let go one hand until you have a firm hold with the other, or you and 
the whole affair may come to extreme grief. 



19C THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

This wo consider one of the easiest methods of getting off, although it 
looks so difficult. 

To RIDE SIDE-SADDLE. Riding in a side-sitting position is very a 
but you must first learn the foregoing exercises. First vault on the usual 
way and work up to a moderate speed, then throw the right leg over the 
handles as in the act of getting off, but still retain your seat, and continue 
workin^ with the left leg only. Now from this position you may practise 
passing ibe right leg back again into its original position when s 
across the saddle in the usual way. 

To REST THE LEGS. A very useful position is that of stretching 
the leers in front when taking long journeys, as it rests the legs, and also, 
as sometimes you do not require to work the treadle descending an in- 
cline, the weight of the machine and yourself being sufficient to contmu 
the desired momentum. 

In this position the break is generally used ; but when putting i 
mind you do not turn the handles with both hands at once, but turn wit 
one first and then with the other ; as, if the spring should be strong, and 
you attempt to use both hands in turning it, as a matter of course when 
you let go to take fresh hold the handles will fly back, to your great an- 
noyance. 

To RIDE WITHOUT USING THE HANDS. This is a very pretty and eff 
live performance, but of course it is rather difficult, and requires much 
practice before attempting it, as the steering must be done with t 
alone, the arms being generally folded. 

To accomplish this feat, you must keep your feet firmly on the treadl< 
in the upward as well as the downward movement, taking care not to 
take them off at all, as you will thereby keep entire command of them, 
which is absolutely necessary, as in fact they are doing double work, both 
propelling and also steering the machine. You will, as you become ex 
pert in this feat, acquire a kind of dinging hold of the treadles, which 
you will find very useful, indeed, in ascending a hill when you tak 
outdoor travelling. Fancy riding of this kind must only be attempt* 

good surfaces. 

Description will not assist you much here, but when you attempt 
will soon find out that when riding without using the hands, every strol 
of the foot either right or left, must be of the same force, as, if you pre 
heavier on one treadle than on the other, the machine will have a ten- 
dency to o in that direction; and thus you must be on. the watc 
counteract it by a little extra pressure on the other treadle, without giv- 
in<r enough to turn the machine in the reverse direction. 



THIRD LESSON*. 197 

This is all a matter of nice judgment, l>ut when you can do it a very 
is produced, giving spectators tin.- idea of your complete mas- 
tery of the bicycle. 

But remember that you must be always ready to seize the handles, and 
resume command if any interruption to your progress presents itself. 

To RIDE WITHOUT USING LKOS OR HANDS. As you can now ride with- 
out using the hands, let us now proceed to try & performance which, at 
first sight, will perhaps seem almost impossible, but which is really not 
much more difficult than going without hands. This is to get the veloci- 
pede up to full speed, and then lift your feet off the treadles and place 
them on each side of the rest, and when your legs are up in this way, you 
will find that you can let go the handles and fold your arms, and thus 
actually ride without using cither /'/.s or ]u.ni<l. 

In progressing thus, the simple fact is that you overcome gravity by 
motion, and the machine cannot fall until the momentum is lost. 

This should only be attempted by an expert rider, who can get up a 
speed of twelve to fourteen miles per hour, and on a very good surface and 
with a good run ; and, in fact, from this position you may lean back, and 
lie flat down, your body resting on and along the *pring. 

AT REST. We are now come to the last and best, or, we may say, the 
most useful feat of all, and this is to stop the bicycle and sit quite still 
upon it. 

The best way to commence practising this is to run into a position 
where you can hold by a railing or a wall, or perhaps the assistant will 
stand with his shoulder ready for you to take hold of. 

Now gradually slacken speed, and when coming nearly to a standstill, 
turn the front wheel until it makes an angle of 45 deg. with the back 
wheel, and try all you know to sit perfectly still and upright. 

Of course this is a question of balancing, and you will soon find the 
knack of it. When the machine inclines to the left, slightly press the left 
treadle ; and if it evinces a tendency to lean to the right, press the light 
treadle; and so on, until, sooner or later you achieve a correct equilibrium, 
when you may take out your pocket-book and read or even write letters, 
\-e., without difficulty. 

Now, we do not think that there is anything further to be said as to 
learning to ride the bicycle, and we can only express a hope that if you 
follow the advice and instruction we have been able to give, you will 
become an expert rider, and be able to begin practising on the " Modern 
Bicycle." 



198 THE HOME, FAEM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

CHOICE OF A MACHINE. And first, as to the choice of a machine. In 
this case it is imperative to have the very best you can get, as it is utter 
folly to risk life and limb by using one of inferior make. 

In choosing a bicycle, of course the first thing to be considered is the 
height of wheel, which greatly depends on the length of limb of the rider ; 
as, of course, though two men may be of equal height one may have a 
longer leg than the other. A good guide is to sit on the machine and let 
the toe touch the lower treadle without quite straightening the leg, as of 
course, command must never be lost. For a rider of average height, say 
5 feet 8 inches, a machine of 52 to 5-t inches we should consider suitable. 
But, of course, any well-known and reliable maker will furnish you with 
a machine to suit you. 

Having selected your " Modern Bicycle," the first thing you want to 
accomplish is to be able to mount and dismount. Of course, the saddle 
being nearly as high as your shoulder, it is impossible to vault on as with 
the old " practicer." It is therefore necessary to provide a " step," which, 
in all the modern machines, is fitted on the backbone, or connecting-iron, 
just above the hinder fork on the left side, at a convenient height. It 
consists of a small round plate, jagged, to afford a firm grip for the toe 
when placed upon it. 

There are two ways of mounting. One is to start the machine and to 
run by the left side, and put the left toe upon the step while in motion, 
throwing the right leg over on to the seat ; the other is to stand at the 
back of the machine, standing on the right leg, with the left toe on the 
step, and, gently starting, hop with the right leg until you have gained a 
sufficient impetus to raise yourself on the step, and throw your right leg 
across the seat. 

The first is the best plan as you can run with greater speed, and mount ; 
in fact, the quicker you go the easier to get on. In many cases it is the 
only practicable plan, as, for instance, on remounting on a slight ascent, 
where it would be most difficult to get up sufficient speed by the hopping 
plan, which, moreover, does not present a very graceful appearance. 

Now, in the second way of getting on by the step, you hold the handle 
with the left hand to guide the machine, placing the other on the seat. 
You can now run it along easily. Your object in having one hand on 
the seat is, that if both hands are on the handles, you are over-reached, 
and it is difficult to keep your balance. Now take a few running step-, 
and when the right foot is on the ground give a hop with Ihat foot, and 
at the same time place the left foot on the step, throwing your right leg 
over on to the seat. Now, the hop is the principal thing to be done, as if, 



THIRD l.KSSOX. !<)!) 

when running beside the bicycle at a good speed, you were merely to 
place the left foot on the step without giving a good hop with the other, 
the right leg would be left behind, and you would be merely what i- 
called " doing the splits." 

You will see at once that as the machine is travelling at good speed, 
you have no time to raise one foot after the other (as in walking up stairs), 
as when you lift up your foot, you are as it were, " in the air," and noth- 
ing but a good long running hop will give time to adjust your toe on the 
step as it is moving. This is, of course, difficult to describe, and we need 
not say, requires a certain amount of strength and agility, without which 
no one can expect to become an expert rider. 

But in the high racing machines, no one would think of trying to mount 
without the assistance of a friendly arm, and a stand or stool of suitable 
height. 

Having now mounted the high machine, you will find that the reach of 
the leg, and the position altogether, is very different from the seat on the 
bone-shaker ; " but when you get some command, you will find the easy 
gliding motion much pleasanter, a> well as faster. You are now seated 
much higher, in fact, almost on the top of the wheel : and, instead of 
using the ball of the foot, you must use your toe ; and when the treadle 
is at the bottom of the throw of the crank, your leg will be almost at its 
fullest extent, and nearly straight. 

Now you must pay a little attention to the process of alighting. 

In getting off by the step, all you have to do is to reach back your left 
foot until you feel the step, and. resting upon the handles, raise yourself 
up, and throw the right leg over the seat on to the ground. 

But we consider getting off by the treadle much the preferable way 
when you can manage it ; but you must be very careful when first trying 
not to attempt it until the machine is perfectly at rest. Get some one to 
hold you up, the bicycle being stationary, and practise getting off in the 
following manner : First, see that the left hand crank is at the bottom, 
and with your left foot on that treadle practise swinging your right leg 
backwards and forwards, in order to get used to the movement. Now 
while in position, throw your right leg with a swing backwards, resting 
as much as you can of your weight upon the handles, and raise yourself 
with your right foot into position, continuing your swinging movement 
until you are off the seat and on the ground. 

When you are well able to get off in this way. with the bicycle at rest, 
you may attempt it when slackening speed to stop. As it is, of course, 
easier to get off the slower you are going, you must come almost to a 



200 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

standstill, just keeping way enough to prevent the machine falling over, 
as, if you attempt it when going at all quickly, you will have to run by 
its side after you are off, which is a difficult feat for any but a skilful 
rider. 

The great advantage of getting off in this way is that, with practice, 
you can choose your own time, which is very useful when an obstacle 
suddenly presents itself, as in turning a corner ; and in getting off the 
other way you are liable to lose time in feeling for the step. 

There are different styles of riding, and of course at first you are glad 
to be able to get along in any way you can ; but when you come to have 
any command over your machine, and have time to think about style, you 
cannot do better than take for your model some graceful rider whose 
upright and graceful seat gives an impression of quiet power. Very 
different is the appearance presented by some well-known riders, who 
although going at really good speed, present a painful appearance, hang- 
ing forwards over the handles as if about to topple over, and favouring 
the beholders with such a variety of facial contortions. 

HINTS ON TRAINING. It is very difficult to give any rules that will 
apply to all, as constitutions differ so widely; but the simple rules of 
regular diet, rest, and exercise will apply to every one, whether they are 
going, as the saying is, " to race for a man's life," or merely trying to get 
themselves into the best frame of body to endure moderate exertion. 
The daily use of the cold bath, or tepid if necessary, cannot be too strongly 
insisted upon ; and also early rising and going to rest ; and the avoidance 
of all rich viands, such as pork, veal, duck, salmon, pastry, etc., etc. Beef, 
mutton, fowls, soles, and fish of similar kind, should form the principal 
diet. The severity of the rules of professional training has been much 
relaxed of late years, and many things, such as vegetables, stimulants 
in great moderation, etc., are now allowed, which before were rigidly 
excluded. 

In training for any special effort, of course it is necessai-y to have pro- 
fessional assistance ; but with moderate attention to diet and regimen, 
any one may soon get himself in to good condition, and particularly if he 
becomes an habitual bicycle-rider. 



^Inimminq. 




! \V1MM IN ( is the art of keeping the body afloat and propel- 
ling it by means of the body and hands. The swimming of 
man is artificial, but as the specific gravity of the human 
body is very little greater than that of water, it can be 
floated with very little difficulty. 

Every boy should be taught to swim, and if he reads the 
following piigi-s and abides by the instructions, he can easily 
teach himself. 

The first care of the intending swimmer is, of course, to 
find a proper piece of water in which to learn his first lessons. The very 
best water that can be found is that of the sea, on account of its saltnr 
and bitterness, whereby two great advantages are obtained. 

The first advantage is, that, on account of the salt and other substances 
which are dissolved in it, the sea- water is so much heavier than fresh that 
it fives more support to the body, and enables the beginner to float much 
sooner than he can expect to do in fresh water. 

The other advantage is, that the taste of the sea-water is so nauseous- 
that the learner takes very good care to keep his lips tightly shut, and so 
does not commit the common error of opening the mouth, which is fatal to 
all swimming, and is sure to dishearken a beginner by letting water get 
down his throat and half-choke him. 

As to place, there is nothing better than a sloping sandy shore, where 
the tide is not very strong. In some places the tide runs with such a force, 
that if the beginner is taken off his legs he will be carried away, or, at 
least, that he will have great difficulty in regaining his feet. 

\Ve strongly recommend him to walk over the spot at low water, and 
see whether there are any stones, sticks, rocks, or holes and if so, to 
remove all the movable impediments and mark the position of the others. 
Take a special care of the holes, for there is nothing so treacherous. A 
hole of some six or seven inches in depth and a yard in diameter, look- 
insignificant when the water is out that few persons would take any notice 
of it ; but, when a novice is in the water, these few inches may just make 
the difference between safety and death. 



202 THE HOME, FAKJI AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

On sandy shores the most fertile source of holes is to be found in large 
stones. They sink rather deeply into the sand and form miniature rocks, 
round which the water courses as the tides ebb and flow, thus cutting a 
channel completely round the stone. Even when the stone is removed, the 
hole will remain unfilled throughout several tides. 

The next best place for learning to swim, is a river with a fine sandy 
bed, clear water, and no weeds. 

When such a spot has been found, the next care is to examine the bed 
of the river, and to remove very carefully everything that might hurt the 
feet. If bushes should grow on the banks, look out carefully for broken 
scraps of boughs, which fall into the stream, become saturated with water, 
sink to the bottom, and become fixed to one of the points upwards. 

If human habitations should be near, beware of broken glass and crock- 
ery ; fragments of which are generally flung into the river, and will inflict 
most dangerous wounds if trodden on. If the bed of the stream should be 
in the least muddy, look out for mussels, which lie imbedded almost to 
their sharp edges, that project upwards and cut the feet nearly as badly as 
broken glass. 

Failing sea and river, a pond or canal is the only resource, and furnishes 
the very worst kind of water. The bed of most ponds is studded with all 
kinds of cutting and piercing objects, which are thrown in by careless boy>, 
and remain where they fell. Then, the bottom is almost invariably muddy, 
and the water is seldom clean. Still, bad as is a pond, it is better than 
nothing, and the intending swimmer may console himself with the reflec- 
tion that he is doing his duty, and with the prospect of swimming in the 
sea some time or other. 

Of course the large public baths possess some of the drawbacks of ponds ; 
but they have, at all events, the advantage of a regulated depth, a firm 
bank, and no mud. 

As the very essence of swimming lies in confidence, it is always better 
for the learner t> feel secure that he can leave the water whenever he 
likes. Therefore, let him take a light rope of tolerable length, tie one end 
to some firm object on the bank, and let the rest of the rope lie in the 
water. " Manilla " is the best kind of rope for this purpose, because it is so 
light that it floats on the surface instead of sinking, as is the case with an 
ordinary hempen rope. 

If there is only sand on the shore, the rope can be moored quite firmly 
by tying it to the middle of a stout stick, burying the stick a foot or so in 
the sand, and filling up the trench. You may pull till you break the rope, 



KI.OATINt; OX THK I'.Ai'K. 203 

but you will never pull the stick out of its place. If \u an- *,>,// nervous, 
tii- two sticks in the shape- of a cross and bury them in like manner. 

The rope need not be a large one, as it will not have to sustain the whole 
weight of your body, and it will be found that a cord as thick as an ordi- 
nary washing-line will answer every purpose. 

On the side of a stream or pond, tie the rope to a tree or hammer a stake 
in the ground. A stake eighteen inches in length, and as thick as an ordi- 
nary broomstick is quite huge enough. Hammer it rather more than two- 
thirds into the ground, and let it lean boldly away from the water's edge. 
The best way of fixing the rope to it is by the "clove hitch." 

Now, having your rope in your hand, go quietly into the water buck- 
rds, keeping your face towards the bank. As soon as you are fairly in 
the water, duck completely beneath the surface. Be sure that you really 
do go fairly under the water, for there is nothing more deceptive than tin- 
feel of the water to a novice. He dips his head, as he fancies, at least a 
foot beneath the surface ; he feels the water in his nose, he hears it in his 
ears, and thinks he is almost at the bottom, when, in reality, the back of 
his head is quite dry. 

The best way of "clucking" easily is to put the left hand on the back 
of the head, hold to the rope with the right hand, and then duck until the 
left hand is well under water. 

The learner should next accustom himself to the new element by mov- 
ing about as much as possible, walking as far as the rope will allow him, 
and jumping up and down so as to learn by experience the buoyancy of 
the water. 

Perhaps the first day may be occupied by this preliminary process, and 
on the second visit the real business may begin. 

In swimming, as in most other pursuits, a good beginning is invaluable. 

Let the learner bestow a little care on the preliminaries, and he will have 
no bad habits to unteach himself afterwards. It is quite as easy to learn 
a good style at first as a bad style, although the novice may just at the 
beginning fancy that he could do better by following his own devices. 

The first great object is to feel a perfect confidence in the sustaining 
power of the water, and, according to our ideas, the best method of doing 
so is by learning to float on the back. 

FLOATING ON THE BACK. 

Take care that the cord is within easy reach, so that it may be grasped 
in a moment, should the novice become nervous, as he is rather apt to do

just at first. Take it in both hands, and lay yourself very gently in the 
water, arching the spine backwards as much as possible, and keeping the 
legs and knees perfectly straight and stiff. 

Now press the head as far back as possibly can be done, and try to force 
the back of the head between the shoulder-blades. You can practise this 
attitude at home, by lying on two chairs. 

When you have thus lain in the water you will find that you are almost 
entirely upheld by its sustaining power, and that only a very little weight 
is sustained by the rope. On reflection you will also discern that the only 
weight which pulls on the rope is that of your hands and arms, which are 
out of the water, and which, therefore, act as dead weight. 

Indeed, you might just as well lay several iron weights of a pound each 
upon your body, for the hands and arms are much heavier than we gene- 
rally fancy. Just break an arm or a leg, and you will find out what heavy 
articles they are. 

Now let your arms sink gradually into the water, and you will see that 
exactly in proportion as they sink, so much weight is taken off the rope ; 
and if you have only courage to put them entirely under water, and to 
loose the rope, your body will be supported by the water alone. 

SWIMMING ON THE BACK, HEAD FIEST. 

There are many modes of swimming on the back, head first ; some in 
which the hands are the moving power, others in which the force is derived 
from the legs, and some in which the legs and arms are both exerted. 

To practise one of these methods viz., that commonly called floating 
you should throw your head gently back, as before, bringing your feet to 
the surface ; let your arms lie in the water close to your sides, using the 
hands in the same manner as when sculling, with a swift pushing motion 
of the palms towards the feet, returning edgeways, thumbs first, by bend- 
ing the arms ; anil pushing again towards the feet by straightening the 
arms close to the sides. This produces a very rapid progress through the 
water, and may be continued for some time. 

Another method is as follows : Throw yourself round on your back 
without stopping (which may be done with a swing of the body, while 
swimming in the first described method), and you will retain part of the 
impetus already acquired. Then throw both hands out of the water, as 
far as you can reach, in the direction you wish to proceed, entering again 
edgeways beyond your head, and describe a segment of a circle in the 



SWIMMING (.IN THK I'.ACK. 1IKAD KIKST. -JO.-, 

water, having the shoulders for a centre. The hands, on appearing again 
on the surface below the hips, should pass immediately through the air 
for another stroke. This mode is very servieeable when taken with 
cramp, or symptoms of cramp, as it removes the stress entirely off the 
muscles of the leg. It may be gracefully varied by using the right and 
left hands alternately. 

For the practice of a third method the hands and arms are to be used 
as in the last, but the progress should be aided by the lower limbs strik- 
ing out with vigour, after having been drawn up to the body by the 
ke made with the arms. The kick should be made as the hands pass 
through the air. This is a very quick manner of swimming, and is most 
commonly resorted to for relief when swimming in a match. 

For another method, lie on your back with your arms folded, or with 
your hands passed over your shoulders hi-neath your neck, or floating 
quietly by your side, drawing up your leg-; towards the chest as high as 
possible, and then striking them backwards with vigour, which will cause 
you to make considerable progress through the water without using the 
arms at all. When you draw up your feet the movement is against the 
surface, where there is little resistance, but, when you strike them out, 
the force is applied in a downward direction, where the resistance is 
greatest. The foregoing method is useful when your arms are tired, or 
you have something to carry or tow after you, the hands being perfectly 
free. 

Steering the course is easily managed by means of the legs. If the left 
leg is allowed to remain still, and the right leg is used, the body is driven 
to the left, and vice versa when the left leg is used and the right is kept 
quiet. The young swimmer must remember that when he brings his legs 
together they must be kept quite straight and the knees stiff The toes 
should also be pointed, so as to offer no resistance to the water. 

Swimming on the back ia a most useful branch of the art, as it requires 
comparatively little exertion and serves to rest the arms when they are 
tired with the ordinary mode of swimming. All swimmers who have to 
traverse a considerable distance always turn occasionally on the back. 
They even in this position allow the arms to lie by the side until they are 
completely rested, while at the same time the body is gently sent through 
the water by the legs. 

Let swimming on the back be perfectly learned, and practised continu- 
ally, so that the young swimmer may always feel secure of himself when 
he is in that position. 



206 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The feet should be kept about twelve or fourteen inches below the sur- 
face of the water, as, if they are kept too high, the stroke is apt to drive 
the upper part of the head and eyes under the water. 

It must always be remarked that it is impossible to arch the spine too 
much, or to press the head too far between the shoulders. 

SWIMMING ON THE CHEST. 

We now come to swimming on the chest, which is the mode adopted by 
most persons, and which, together with swimming on the back, will 
enable the learner to perform almost any aquatic feat. 

In order to begin with confidence, walk into the water until it is almost 
as hih as the chest, and then turn towards the land, so that every move- 
ment may cairy you from the deeper to the shallower water. Next place 
your hands in front of the chest, the fingers stiff and pressed together, 
and the thumb held tightly against the forefinger. Do not press the 
palms together, as too many books enjoin, but hold the hands with the 
thumbs together, the palms downwards and the backs upwards. 

Now lean gently forward in the water, pushing your hands out before 
you until the arms are quite straight, and just before your feet leave the 
bottom give a little push forwards. You will now propel yourself a foot 
or two towards the land. Try how long you can float, and then gently 
drop the feet to the ground. Be careful to keep the head well back and 
the spine arched. 

Repeat this seven or eight times, until you have gained confidence that 
the water will support you for a few seconds. 

The accompanying illustration shows the proper attitude. 

Now go back to the spot whence you started, and try to make a stroke. 
Lay yourself on the water as before, but when the feet leave the bottom 
draw them up close to the body, and then kick them out quickly. When 
they have reached their full extent, press them together firmly, keeping 
them quite straight and the toes pointed. 

This movement will drive you onwards for a short distance, and when 
you feel that you are likely to sink, drop the feet as before. Start again 
and make another stroke, and so on until the water is too shallow. 

At first you will hardly gain more than an inch or two at each stroke ; 
but after a little practice you will gain more and more until you can 
advance three or four feet without putting the legs to the ground. It is 
a good plan to start always from the same spot, and to try in how few 
strokes you can reach the land. There is a great interest in having some 



THE SIDE-STROKK. 207 

definite object in view, and one gets quite excited in trying to reduce the 
number of strok 

The action of the legs may be seen in the illustration. 

The next point is the movement of the arms. 

In reality the arms are more valuable in swimming than the logs, and 
for this simple reason, any one who has the use of his limbs at all is 
obliged to use his legs daily, and that to a considerable extent. Howe\ < 
sedentary he may be, he must walk up and down stairs twice at least in 
the day. He must walk from one room to another. He must get into and 
out of his carriage, and walk a few paces to his office. And in all these 
little walks his legs have to carry the weight of his body, which, to >ct it 
at the least figure, weighs from seventy to ninety pounds 

THE SIDE-STROKE. 

There is no stroke that enables the swimmer to last so long as this does. 
and for this reason : instead of employing both arms* and legs simul- 
taneously in the same manner, the side-stroke employs them simultane- 
ously, but in different manners ; so that when the swimmer is tired of 
exercising one side he can just turn over and proceed with the other, the 
change of action resting the limbs almost as much as actual repose would 
do. 

The side-stroke is thus managed : the swimmer lies on his right side, 
^retching his right arm out as far as he can reach, keeping the fingers 
of the right hand quite straight and the hand itself held edgewise, so as 
to cut the water like a shark's fin. The left hand is placed across the 
chest, with the back against the right breast, and the swimmer is then 
ready to begin. 

He commences by making the usual stroke with his legs, and the right 
leg, being undermost, doing the greatest share of the work. Before the 
impetus gained by the stroke is quite expended, the right arm is brought 
round with a broad sweep, until the palm of the hand almost touches the 
right thigh. At the same moment, the left hand makes a similar sweep, 
but is carried backwards as far as it can go. 

The reader will see that the hands act directly upon the water like the 
blades of a pair of oars, and do not waste any of their power by oblique 
action. 

In ordinary swimming we seldom use the left arm, but allow it to hang 
quietly in the water, so that it may be perfectly ready for work when 



208 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 



wanted. Then, after some little time, we turn round, swim on the other 
side, and give the left arm its fair share of labour. 

There is a modification of swimming on the side, which is sometimes 
called THRUSTING, and sometimes the INDIAN STROKE, because the North 
American Indians generally employ it.

I. PRELIMINARY RULES. 

'N cases of apparent death, either from drowning or other suf- 
focation, send immediately for medical assistance, blankets, 
and dry clothing, but proceed to treat the patient instantly 
on the spot, in the open air, with the face downward, whe- 
ther on shore or afloat ; exposing the face, neck, and chest 
to the wind, except in severe weather, and removing all 
tight clothing from the neck and chest, especially the braces. 
The points to be aimed at are ; first and immediately the 
restoration of breathing ; and secondly, after breathing is re- 
stored, the promotion of warmth and circulation. 

The efforts to restore breathing must be commenced immediately and 
energetically and persevered in for one or two hours, or until that a medi- 
cal man has pronounced life extinct. 

Efforts to promote warmth and circulation, beyond removing the wet 
clothes and drying the skin, must not be made until the first appearance 
of natural breathing. For if circulation of the blood be induced before 
breathing has recommenced, the restoration to life will be endangered. 

II. TREATMENT TO RESTORE BREATHING, ACCORDING TO DR. MARSHALL 

HALL'S METHOD. 

\.-To Clear the Throat. 

Place the patient on the floor or ground with the face downwards, and 
one of the arms under the forehead, in which position all fluids will more 



DROWN IXC. 209 

readily escape by the mouth, and the tongue itself will fall forward, leav- 
ing the entrance into the windpipe free. As-^t this operation l>v wiping 
and cleansing the mouth. 

If satisfactory breathing commences, use the treatment described below 
to promote warmth. 

If there be only slight breathing, or no breathing, or if the breathing 
fail, then 

2. To excite breathing. 

Turn the patient well and instantly on the side, supporting the head, 
and excite the nostrils with snuff, hartshorn, and smelling salts ; or tickle 
the throat with a feather, .ice., if they are at hand. Rub the chest and 
face warm, and dash cold water or cold and hot water alternately, on them. 

If there be no success, lose not a moment, but instantly 

3. To imitate lircathin<j. 

Replace the patient on the face, raising and supporting the chest well on 
a folded coat or other article of dress. 

Turn the body very gently on the side and a little beyond and then 
briskly on the face, back again ; repeating these measures cautiously, effi- 
ciently, and perseveringly about fifteen times in the minute, or once every 
four or five seconds, occasionally varying the side. 

By placing the patient on the chest, the weight of the body forces the 
air out ; when turned on the side, this pressure is removed, and air enters 
the chest. 

On each occasion that the body is replaced on the face make uniform 
but efficient pressure with brisk movement, on the back between and be- 
low the shoulder blades or bones on each side, removing the pressure im- 
mediately before turning the body on the side. 

During the whole of the operations let one person attend solely to the 
movements of the head, and of the arm placed under it. 

The result is respiration or natural breathing; and, if not too late, life. 

Whilst the above operations are being proceeded with, dry the hands 
and feet; and as soon as dry clothing or blankets can be procured, strip 
body, and cover or gradually reclothe it, but taking care not to inter- 
fere with the efforts to restore breathing. 



- 



III. TREATMENT TO RESTORE BREATHING, ACCORDING TO DR. SILVES- 
TER'S METHOD. 

Instead of these proceedings, or should these efforts not prove success- 



210 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

ful in the course of from two to five minutes, proceed to imitate breath- 
ing by Dr. Silvester's method, as follows : 

1. Patient's position. 

Place the patient on the back of a flat surface, inclined a little upwards, 
from the feet ; raise and support the head and shoulders on a small firm 
cushion, or folded article of dress placed under the shoulder blades. 



2. To effect a free entrance of air into the windpipe. 

Cleanse the mouth and nostrils, draw forward the patient's tongne, and 
keep it projecting beyond the lips ; an elastic band over the tongue and 
under the chin will answer this purpose, or a piece of string or tape may 
be tied round them by raising the lower jaw, the teeth may be made to 
retain the tongue in that position. Remove all tight clothing from about 
the neck and chest, especially the braces. 

3. To imitate the movements of breathing. 

Standing at the patient's head, grasp the arms just above the elbows, 
and draw the arms gently and steadily upwards above the head, and keep 
them stretclied upwards for two seconds. (By this means air is drawn 
into the lungs.} Then turn down the patient's arms and press them 
o-ently and firmly for two seconds against the sides of the chest. (By this 
means air is pressed out of the lungs. Pressure on the breast-bone will 

aid this.) 

Repeat these measures alternately, deliberately, and perseveringly, 
about fifteen times in a minute, until a spontaneous effort to respire is 
perceived ; immediately upon which cease to imitate the movements of 
breathing and proceed to induce circulation and warmth. 

Should a warm bath be procurable, the body may be placed in it up to 
the neck, continuing to imitate the movements of breathing. Raise the 
body in twenty seconds in a sitting position, and dash cold water against 
the chest and face, and pass ammonia under the nose. The patient should 
not be kept in the warm bath longer than five or six minutes. 

4. To excite inspiration. 

During the employment of the above method excite the nostrils with 
snuff or smelling salts, or tickle the throat with a feather. Rub the chest 
and face briskly, and dash cold and hot water alternately on them. 



DKOWNIXG. 211 

The above directions are chiefly Dr. H. R. Silvester's method of restor- 
ing the apparently dead or drowned, and have been approved by the 
Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. 

IV. TREATMENT AFTER NATURAL BREATHING HAS BEEN RESTORED. 
1. To promote warmth and circulation. 

Wrap the patient in dry blankets, commence rubbing the limbs upwards, 
with firm grasping pressure and energy, using handkerchiefs, flannels, &c. 
(By this means the blood is propelled along the veins towards the heart.) 

The friction must be continued under the blanket or over the dry 
clothing. 

1. Promote the warmth of the body by the application of hot flannels, 
bottles, or bladders of hot water, heated bricks, &c., to the pit of the sto- 
mach, the arm-pits, between the thighs, and to the soles of the feet 
Warm clothing may generally be obtained from bystanders. 

2. If the patient has been carried to a house after respiration has been 
restored, be careful to let the air play freely about the room. 

3. On the restoration of life, when the power of swallowing has re- 
turned, a table.spoonful of warm water, small quantities of wine, warm 
brandy and water, or coffee, should be administered. The patient should 
be kept in bed, and a disposition to sleep encouraged. During reaction, 
large mustard plasters to the chest below the shoulders will greatly re- 
lieve the distressed breathing. 

V. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 

The above treatment should be continued for some hours, as it is an er- 
roneous opinion that persons are irrecoverable because life does not soon 
make its appearance, persons having been restored after persevering for 
many hours. 

VI. APPEARANCES WHICH GENERALLY INDICATE DEATH FROM DROWN- 
ING. 

Breathing and the heart's action cease entirely ; the eyelids are gene- 
rally half closed ; the pupfls dilated ; the jaws clenched ; the fingers semi- 
contracted ; the tongue approaches to the under edges of the lips, and 
these, as well as the nostrils, are covered with a frothy mucus. Coldness 
and pallor of surface increase. 



212 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



VII. CAUTIONS. 

1. Prevent unnecessary crowding of persons round the body; especially 
if in an apartment. 

2. Avoid rough usage, and do not allow the body to remain on the back 
unless the tongue is secured. 

3. Under no circumstances hold the body up by the feet. 

4. On no account place the body in a warm bath, unless under medical 
direction, and even then it should only be employed as a momentary ex- 
citant.

fortune- vlclling. 




HIS is a very interesting game, and may be played by any 
number of persons. A board is made and divided into 
eleven squares each way, as shown in the diagram given 
here, the figure one being in the centre. Each square must 
be numbered as in the diagram. The person who wishes 
to tiy his fortune must place his forefinger on a square 
without looking at it; then refer to the list for the num- 
brr marked on the square touched, and you will obtain an 
answer, which, like those given by professed fortune tel- 
lers, will often prove false or ridiculous ; as, for instance, when a married 
lady is told that she longs to be married (84), or a child of seven is in- 
formed that he will be married this year (89) ; but it is a very amusing 
game notwithstanding.

THE ORACULUM OR BOOK OF FATE.

The Oraculum is gifted with every requisite variety of response to the 
following questions : 

1. Shall I obtain my wish ? 

2. Shall 1 have success in my undertaking 

3. Shall I gain or lose in my cause ? 

4. Shall I have to live in foreign parts '.

11. What sort of a wife or husband shall I have ? 

12. Will she have a son or daughter ? 

13. Will the patient recover '. 

14. Will the prisoner be released ? 

15. Shall I be lucky or unlucky >. 

16. What does my dream signify ? 



222 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA, 

How to Work the Oraculum. 

Make marks in four lines, one under another, in the following manner, 
making more or less in each line, according to your fancy : 



* 
















# 


# * * * * i 







Then reckon the number of marks in each line, and if it be odd, mark 
down one dot ; if even, two dots. If there be more than nine marks, rec- 
kon the surplus ones over that number only, viz. : 

* 

The number of marks in the first line of the foregoing are odd ; therefore 

make one mark thus ^ 

In the second, even, so make two thus # 

In the third, odd again, make one mark only # 

In the fourth, even again, two marks 4 # 

To Obtain tlie Answer. 

You must refer to THE ORACULUM, at the top of which you will find a 
row of dots similar to those you have produced, and a column of figures 
corresponding with those prefixed to the questions ; guide your eye down 
the column, at the top of which you find the dots resembling your own, 
till you come to the letter on a line with the number of the question you 
are trying ; then refer to the page having that letter at the top, and on a 
line with the dots which are similar to your own, you will find your an- 
swer. 

The following are unlucky days, on which none of the questions should 
be worked, or any enterprise undertaken : January 1, 2, 4, 6, 18, 20, 22 ; 
February 6, 17, 2G ; March 24, 26 ; April 10, 27, 28 ; May 7, 8 ; June 29 ; 
July 17, 21 ; August 20, 22 ; September 5, 30 ; October 6 ; November 3, 
29; December 6, 10, 15. 

%* It is not right to try a question twice in the one day.

taken to him by the auctioneer. No one is to laugh on pain of paying a 

forfeit. 

The Anxious Mother. 

ONE GENTLEMAN AND FIVE LADIES. 

A gentleman, in a cap and shawl, is seated with daughters before him, 
sitting in a row, when he instructs them, by example, how to smile, sim- 
per, look bashful, languishing, sing, titter, and laugh. A bright and lively 
gentleman can make this game a great source of amusement. 

Poor Puss. 
ALL THE LADIES AND ONE GENTLEMAN. 

The gentleman goes round and says to each lady "Poor Puss," to which 
she must gravely answer, " Me-ew ! Me-ew ! " Whoever laughs or smiles 
must pay a forfeit. The fun lies in the fact that one or more will find 
impossible to refrain from laughing. 

Magic Music. 
FOUR GENTLEMEN. 

They must be seated in a row, and throwing themselves back in their 
chairs, must all snore in different keys; the Dead March in Saul being 
played over three times as an accompaniment. Any one who laughs u 
be punished at the discretion of the company. 

Mettle Potoloski and Her Dancing Bear. 
ONE GENTLEMAN AND ONE LADY. 

The lady, holding the gentleman by a string or ribbon, makes him 
dance or perform whatever antics she chooses, he being obliged to obey 
her orders. Laughing is to be punished by a forfeit. 

The Musical Duck. 
ONE GENTLEMAN AND ONE LADY. 

The gentleman chooses any lady who can sing, and she is to sing, to 
any air she pleases, the words " Quack ! quack ! " using no other woi 
and singing the air correctly. 



<;AMKS, FORFEITS, ETC. 2.31 

Mi*8 Ann and Jane Smith's Tabby (' 
Two GENTLEMEN AND ALL THE LADIES. 

The ladies all remain in their places, and two gentlemen in shawls and 
bonnets or caps go round, one with a saucer of milk, the other with a tea- 
spoon, with which she gives a sip of milk to each, saying, " Take that, 
my pretty puss ! " to which, after taking it, " puss " must gravely answer 
" Mew." Laughter must be severely punished. 

The Hurrid Man. 
ONE GENTLEMAN. 

He must go round and pay a bad compliment to every lady in the 
room, who is to answer " You horrid man ! " Any one who laughs is to 
pay a forfeit. 

The Rebuff. 

A LADY OR GENTLEMAN. 

The lady or gentleman go and perform a sneeze to each of the gentle- 
men, if a lady, and vice versa. The answer is to be, " I'm not to be sneezed 
at." No one must laugh under penalty of paying a forfeit. Those who 
can command their gravity must indeed have a rare control over them- 
selves. 

Pat a Cake. 

Two GENTLEMEN LADIES ad lib. 

The two gentlemen sit on low stools, patting each other's head. The 
ladies dance round three times, singing 

Pat a cake, pat a cake, baker's man, 
Make it and bake it as fast as you can ; 
Make it, and bake, and mark it with B, 
The letter for Beauty, then give it to me. 

The Tlp*y Polka. 

The set stand up and dance, the music constantly changing time. Each 
player must keep time, and maintain his gravity under penalty of paying 
a forfeit. 



232 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

Confidences. 
THE WHOLE COMPANY. 

This game is an amusing illustration of how a tale gains in telling. A 
lady must whisper to her next-door neighbour (i. e., the person sitting by 
her) an account of something which one of the gentlemen present has said 
or done. The listener repeats it, in a whisper also, to the lady or gentle- 
man seated by her ; and thus it is whispered from one to the other all 
round the room, till it reaches the last person, who repeats it aloud. It 
will be found, no doubt, that, either through mistake or playful malice, 
it has gained considerably in its passage round the circle. 

Then a gentleman has to do the same, choosing one of the ladies present 
as the heroine of his tale, and this "confidence" is repeated all around the 
room till it reaches the last person, as before. Example of the game : 

First Lady whispers " Mr. Smith has just told me that he saw a gen- 
tleman this morning smoking a cigar outside an omnibus, who looked just 
like a gorilla." 

Second Lady whispers " Mr. Smith saw a gentleman on an omnibus- 
just like a gorilla, and he was smoking a cigar." 

Fourth Gentleman (a little deaf) " Smith saw a gorilla this morning, 
as he was smoking a cigar on the omnibus with a gentleman." 

Fifth Speaker " Mr. Smith saw a gorilla on an omnibus this morning 
He was smok ing a cigar with another gentleman." 

Sixth Speaker " Mr. Smith saw the gorilla to-day. It was on an om- 
nibus, with its keeper, and it was smoking a cigar." 

Seventh Speaker " Smith saw Monsieur de Chaillu this morning with 
his gorilla on an omnibus. They were both smoking cigars." 

Eighth Speaker " Smith saw Mons. de Chaillu this morning on an 
omnibus ; he had two gorillas with him, who were smoking cigars." 

Ninth Speaker " Smith sat by De Chaillu and his gorilla this morn- 
ing on the omnibus, and the gorilla actually smoked a cigar with him." 

Tenth Speaker " I have just heard, with much surprise, that Smith 
travelled on an omnibus this morning with Monsieur de Chaillu and his 
gorillas, and that Smith gave the monkeys a cigar. The two monkeys- 
smoked as well as Mr. Smith can." 

Eleventh Speaker " Smith went on a 'bus this morning, and by his 
side were De Chaillu and his gorillas. Smith gave them a cigar and the 
two monkeys smoked together.'' 

Twelfth Speaker (repeats aloud) " I have just heard Smith called a 
monkey by Miss Brown since the story comes originally from her. It 
seems, that she says that Smith went on an omnibus to-day wirh Mons- 



GAMES, FORFEITS, ETC. 53?- 

ieur de Chaillu and the gorilla ; that Smith gave the gorilla a cigar and 
took one himself; and that the two monkeys, i. e.,l suppose, Smith and 
the gorilla, smoked together ! " 

Mr. Smith bows his thanks. The first lady repeats verbatim her win 
per, to the amazement of the circle. 

The Divination of the Elements. 
AN OLD SCOTCH GAME. 

A row of soup-plates is put on the table. One plate holds water, another 
earth, another air i. e., it is left empty ; in another is a pistol. 

Any lady wishing to learn her future fate is taken from the room and 
blindfolded ; the plates are moved and change places meantime. Then sh< 
is led to the table and told to put her hand on a plate, whichever she 
chooses, If she puts her finger in the water, it is a sign that she will 
marry a sailor, or take long voyages : if she touch the earth, she will be a 
stay-at-home, or marry a civilian, either a merchant or a professional man ; 
if she touches the empty or air-plate, she will live single, " free as air ; " 
if she touches the pistol, she will marry a soldier. 

This funny divination can be adapted to gentlemen by making the 
water represent a fair and fickle wife or long voyage ; the earth, a dark 
and domestic wife, with a landed inheritance ; the air, or empty plate, old 
bachelorhood ; the pistol, a quarrelsome wife, etc. 

Another and prettier way of playing this game is by arranging three 
soup-plates on a side table covered with a cloth. In one is clean water ; 
in another, dirty water ; in the third, earth. 

The inquirer into futurity is blindfolded ; the plates are moved and 
changed about so that she cannot tell how they stand. Then she is led 
to the table and puts her hand out, and whichever plate she touches i< 
significant of her future fate. 

If she touches the clean water, she will marry the man she loves. 

If she touches the dirty water, she will marry unhappily. 

If she finds the earth, she will die unmarried. The divination can. of 
course, be used by gentlemen. 

The Quiet Little Dears. 
THREE GENTLEMEN. 

They must sit in the middle of the room with books on their laps, on 
which they must each build a card house. They aite not to move until 
the three houses are standing together. 



234 TH E HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP.EDIA. 

The Man who is too Happy. 
ONE GENTLEMAN AND Six LADIES. 

The gentleman sitting in the middle of the room must be complimented 
and paid attention by each lady in turn. Without rising, he is to respond 
by every species of grateful manner ; first murmuring in a whisper, 
" I'm too happy," increasing in the tone of his voice each time, till reach- 
ing the highest note, he rushes out of the room. 

The Quakers' Meeting. 
THE WHOLE COMPANY. 

The leader of the game must arrange the company in a circle as Qua- 
kers. The ladies need only sit up very primly, and twirl their thumbs 
round and round slowly, looking steadily on the carpet. Any lady look- 
ing up, or ceasing to twirl her thumbs, must pay a forfeit. Then the 
leader of the game must direct a gentleman to repeat after him, in a draw- 
ling tone (twirling his thumbs slowly all the while), these words : 

" Verily, verily, I do say." 

Each gentleman must repeat the same words, in turn, twirling his 
thumbs the while. When they have been repeated by all the gentlemen, 

the first must say : 

" Verily, verily, I do say 
That I must go to-day." 

The words are to be echoed in like manner. Then the first speaker 

adds : 

" Verily, verily, I do say 

That I must go to-day, 
To visit my sick brother, 
0-BA-DI-AY." 

After which he rises, goes into the middle of the room, and kneels down. 
The nearest gentleman follows, and kneels close to him ; the next close to 
the last, and so on, till they form a line. Then the leader of the game 
must place himself last, kneeling also ; and, by giving a sudden push to the 
last player, he will cause the whole row to fall down like a row of cards 
on the carpet. The ladies are strictly forbidden to laugh at the catastro- 
phe, or to cease twirling their thumbs, under pain of paying a forfeit.

To Tell Any Number Thought Of. 

Ask a person to think of a number ; then tell him to subtract 1 from 
that number; now tell him to multiply the remainder by 2 ; then request 
him a-min to substract 1, and add to the remainder the number he first 
thought of, and to inform you of the total. When he has done this, you 
must" mentally add three to that total, and then divide it by 3, and the 
quotient will be the number first thought of. This is an excellent arith- 
metical pastime, examples of which is given below :

Tlie Ugly Mug. . 

A leader is chosen, and the remainder of the company must follow every 
motion that he makes, while he sings the description. 






*" I put my right hand in, I put my right hand out, I 



^ give my right hand a shake, shake, shake, I turn my - self a - bout. 

The leader should stand facing the others, and his gestures are exactly 
as he descriV.es them. 



236 THE HOME, FAEM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

LEADER. (Singing and making the appropriate gestures, which all 

imitate.') 

I put my right hand in ! (extending the right hand before him,.') 
I put my right hand out ! (turning halfround,and again extend- 
ing the right hand.') 
I give my right hand a shake, shake, shake! (shaking the right 

hand.} 

I turn myself about ! (turns back to first position?) 
The same gestures are performed with the left hand while singing, 
I put my left hand in ! 
I put my left hand out ! 
I give my left hand a shake, shake, shake ! 
I turn myself about ! 
The same performance is gone through with both hands, while singing. 

I put my both hands in, etc. 

At the conclusion of which, the leader continues the gestures with his> 
right foot, singing : 

I put my right foot in ! 
I put my right foot out ! 
I give my right foot a shake, shake, shake ! 
I turn myself about ! 
The same thing is done with the left foot, with the words : 

I put my left foot in, etc. 

The head is the next member brought into active service. 
I put my ugly mug in ! (stretching tlie head and neck forward.) 
I put my ugly inug out ! (turning half round and repeating the same 

motion.) 

I give my ugly mug a shake, shake, shake ! (nodding the head vigor- 
ously.') 

I turn myself about ! 

If the gravity of the company will stand this test, knowing every smile 
must cost a forfeit, choose a new leader and try again to collect some for- 
feits. This will, however, be scarcely called for, as the first time round 
will surely provide a pretty large crop of forfeits. 

The Hutchinson family. 

Several of the party who do not know the trick of the game must be 
selected to leave the room, while the others are instructed in their parts 



GAMES, FORFKITS, KTU. 237 

One of the absent ones is then recalled and introduced as Mr. or Mi*.i 
Hutchinson. 

The remainder of the party must then imitate exactly every movement 
made by this member of the Hutchinson family, even of the most trifling 
description. If the unconscious leader moves an arm, every arm in the 
company makes the same movement ; if any play of feature, such as a 
look cf surprise, follows, every one in the company assumes the same ex- 
pression ; if a wondering look is given around the room, the head moving 
to each side, all make precisely the same gesture. This procedure is con- 
tinued until Mr. or Miss Hutchinson Number One sees into the little 
game, and ends it by taking a seat in motionless quiet. Hutchinson 
Number Two is next ushered in to go through the same ceremonial, and 
the game is repeated until the Hutchinson family is extinct 

It sometimes happens that a quick-witted Hutchinson will find out the 
trick before acknowledging the discovery, and lead the others a dance 
they did not anticipate, as one merry young lady "seeing the point," 
walked slowly and with great gravity up and down a long drawing-room 
and out of one door into the hall, across this into the room again, and 
round the toorn, all the others following htr till they cried for mercy. 

A gentleman, after staring, yawning, and making horrible grimaces at 
his imitators, suddenly commenced a series of taps on each side of his no>- 
with the forefingers of both hands, and with constantly increasing rapid- 
ity, all trying to follow him, till they were so convulsed with laughter 
that they were forced to admit the joke was all in his hands. 

Tlu- M> 

The party are seated in a line, or round the sides of a room, and some 
one previously appointed enters with the message, " My master sends me 
to you, madam," or " sir," as the case may be, directed to any individual 
he may select at his option. " What for i " is the natural inquiry. " To 
do as I do ;" and with this the messenger commences to perform some 
antic, which the lady or gentleman must imitate say he wags his head 
from side to side or taps with one foot incessantly on the floor. The per- 
son whose duty it is to obey commands his iieighbour to the right or to 
the left to " Do as I do," also ; and so on until the whole company are in 
motion, when the messenger leaves the room, re-entering with fresh in- 
junctions. While the messenger is in the room he must see his master's 
will obeyed, and no one must keep from the movement without suffering 
a forfeit The messenger should be some one ingenious in making the 



238 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 



antics ludicrous, and yet kept within moderate bounds, and the game will 
not fail to produce shouts of laughter. 

Among the other tricks which may be commended are such as rocking 
the body too and fro, wiping the eyes with a pocket-handkerchief, yawn- 
ing, whistling, stroking the chin or the beard, and making any grimace. 

Another game, of much the same character, is known by the title, 
" Thus says the Grand Seignor." The chief difference is that the first 
player is stationed in the centre of the room, and prefaces his movements, 
which the others must all follow, by the above words. If he varies his 
command by framing it, " So says the Grand Seignor," the party must 
remain still, and decline to follow his example. Any one who moves 
when he begins with " So," or does not follow him when he commences 
with " Thus," has to pay a forfeit. 



(Etiquette f0r 3/abies. 




JTIQUETTE may be defined as the minor morality of life. 
Its laws, like all other social laws, are the accumlatecl 
results of the wisdom and experience of many genera- 
tions. They form a code with which every educated 
person is bound to be acquainted ; and the object of 
this portion of the Cyclopaedia is to place that code 
before the reader in as succinct, as agreeable, and as 
explanatory a light as the subject admits of. We hope 
and believe that it will be found in all respects a trusty 
and pleasant guide. 

INTKODUCTIONS. 

To introduce persons who are mutually unknown is to undertake a ser- 
ious responsibility, and to certify to each the respectability of the other. 
Never undertake this responsibility without, in the first place, asking 
yourself whether the persons are likely to be agreeable to each other ; nor^ 
in the second place without ascertaining whether it will be acceptable to 
both parties to become acquainted. 



INTKODlVTIti.NS. 239 

Always introduce the gentleman to the lady never the lady to the 
gentleman. The chivalry of etiquette assumes that the lady is invariably 
the superior in right of her sex, and that the gentleman is honoured in the 
introduction. 

Never present a gentleman to a lady without first asking her permis- 
sion to do so. 

When you are introduced to a gentleman, never offer your hand. When 
introduced, persons limit their recognition of each other to a bow. 

Persons who have met at the house of a mutual friend without being 
introduced should not bow if they afterwards meet elsewhere. A bow 
implies acquaintance ; and persons who have not been introduced are not 
acquainted. 

If you are walking with one friend, and presently meet with, or are 
joined by, a second, do not commit the too frequent error of introducing 
them to each other. You have even less right to do so than if they en- 
countered each other at your house during a morning call. 

There are some exceptions to the etiquette of introduction. At a ball, 
or evening party where there is dancing, the mistress of the house may 
introduce any gentleman to any lady without first asking the lady's per- 
mission. But she should first ascertain whether the lady is willing to 
dance ; and this out of consideration for the gentleman, who may other- 
wise be refused. No man likes to be refused the hand of a lady, though 
it be only for a quadrille. 

A sister may present her brother, or a mother her son, without any 
kind of preliminary. 

Friends may introduce friends at the house of a mutual acquaintance ; 
but, as a rule, it is better to be introduced by the mistress of the house. 
Such an introduction carries more authority with it. 

Introductions at evening parties are now almost wholly dispensed with. 
Persons who meet at a friend's house are ostensibly upon an equality, and 
pay a bad compliment to the host by appearing suspicious and formal. 
Some old-fashioned country hosts still persevere in introducing each new 
coiner to all the assembled guests. It is a custom that cannot be too soon 
abolished, and one that places the last unfortunate visitor in a singularly 
awkward position. All that she can do is to make a semicircular cour- 
tesy, like a concert singer before an audience, and bear the general gaze 
with as much composure as possible. 

An introduction given at a ball for the mere purpose of conducting a 
lady through a dance does not give the gentleman any right to bow to her 



240 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

on a future occasion. If he commits this error, she may remember that 
she is not bound to see, or return, his salutation. 

LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION. 

Do not lightly give or promise letters of introduction. Always remem- 
ber that when you give a letter of introduction you lay yourself under an 
obligation to the friend to whom it is addressed. If she lives in a great 
city, such as Chicago or Boston, you in a measure compel her to undergo 
the penalty of escorting the stranger to some of those places of public en- 
tertainment in which the capital abounds. If your friend be a married 
lady, and the mistress of a house, you put her to the expense of inviting 
the stranger to her table. We cannot be too cautious how we tax the 
time and purse of a friend, or weigh too seriously the question of mutual 
advantage in the introduction. Always ask yourself whether the person 
introduced will be an acceptable acquaintance to the one to whom you 
present her ; and whether the pleasure of knowing her will compensate 
for the time or money which it costs to entertain her. If the stranger is 
in any way unsuitable in habits or temperament, you inflict an annoy- 
ance on your friend instead of a pleasure. In questions of introduction 
never oblige one friend to the discomfort of another. 

Those to whom letters of introduction have been given should send 
them to the person to whom they are addressed, and enclose a card. Avoid 
delivering a letter of introduction in person. It places you in the most 
undignified position imaginable, and compels you to wait while it is being 
read, like a servant who has been told to wait for an answer. If the re- 
ceiver of the letter be a really well-bred person, she will call upon you or 
leave her card the next day, and you should return her attention within 
the week. 

If, on the other hand, a stranger sends you a letter of introduction and 
her card, you are bound by the laws of politeness and hospitality, not 
only to call upon her the next day, but to follow up that attention with 
others. If you are in a position to do so, the most correct proceeding is 
to invite her to dine with you. Should this not be within your power, 
you can probably escort her to some of the exhibitions, bazaars, or con- 
certs of the season ; any of which would be interesting to a provincial 
visitor. In short, etiquette demands that you shall exert yourself to show 
kindness to the stranger, if only out of compliment to the friend who in- 
troduced her to ycfu. 

If you invite her to take dinner with you, it is a better compliment to 
ask some others to meet her, than to dine with her tete-d-tete. You are 



VISIT! X( ; CARDS. -241 

thereby giving her an opportunity of making other acquaintances, and are 
ii-sisting your friend in still further promoting the purpose for which she 
gave her the introduction to yourself. 

A letter of introduction should be given unsealed, not alone because 
:ir friend might wish to know what you have said of her, but also as a 
guarantee of your own good faith. As you should never give such a let- 
ter unless you can speak highly of the bearer, this rule of etiquette is 
easy to observe. By requesting your friend to fasten the envelope before 
forwarding the letter to its destination, you tacitly give her permission to 
inspect its contents. 

VISITING CAKDS. 

Visits of ceremony should be short. If even the conversation should 
have become animated, beware of letting your call exceed half an hour's 
length. It is always better to let your friends regret rather than desire 
your withdrawal. 

On returning visits of ceremony you may, without impoliteness, leave 
your card at the door without going in. Do not fail, however, to inquire 
if the family be well. 

Should there be daughters or sisters residing with the lady upon whom 
you call, you may turn down a corner of your card, to signify that the 
visit is p-iid to all. It is better taste, however, to leave cards for each. 

Unless when returning thanks for " kind inquiries," or announcing 
your arrival in, or departure from, town, it is not considered respectful to 
send round cards by a servant. 

Leave-taking cards have P.P.C. (pour prendre conyf) written in the 
corner. Some use P.D.A. (pour dire adieu). 

Autographic fac-similes for visiting cards are affectations in any persons 
but those who are personally remarkable for talent, and whose auto- 
graphs, or fac-similes of them, would be prized as curiosities. 

Visits of condolence are paid within the week after the event which 
occasions them. Personal visits of this kind are made by relations and 
very intimate friends only. Acquaintances should leave cards with nar- 
row mourning borders. 

On the first occasion when you are received by the family after the 
death of one of its members, it is etiquette to wear slight mourning. 

Umbrellas should invariably be left in the hall. 

Never take favourite dogs into a drawing-room when you make a 
morning call. Their feet may be dusty, or they may bark at the sio;ht of 
p 



242 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

strano-ers, or, being of a too friendly disposition, may take the liberty of 
lyin^ on a lady's gown, or jumping on the sofas and easy chairs. Where 
your friend has a favourite cat already established before the fire, a battle 
may ensue, and one or both of the pets be seriously hurt. Besides, many 
persons have a constitutional antipathy to dogs, and others never allow 
their own to be seen in the sitting-rooms. For all or any of these reasons, 
a visitor has no right to inflict upon her friend the society of her dog as 
well as of herself. Neither is it well for a mother to take young children 
with her when she pays morning visits ; their presence, unless they are 
unusually well trained, can only be productive of anxiety to both your- 
self and your hostess. She, while striving to amuse them, or to appear 
interested in them, is secretly anxious for the fate of her album, or the 
ornaments on her etagere ; while the mother is trembling lest the children 
should say or do something objectionable. 

If other visitors are announced, and you have already remained as long 
as courtesy requires, wait till they are seated, and then rise from your 
chair, take leave of your hostess, and bow politely to the newly arrived 
guests. You will, perhaps, be urged to remain, but having once risen, it 
is best to go. There is always a certain air ofgaucherle in resuming your 
seat and repeating the ceremony of leave-taking. 

If you have occasion to look at your watch during a call, ask permis- 
sion to do so, and apologize for it on the plea of other appointments. 

In receiving morning visitors, it is not necessary that the la 1y should 
lay aside the employment in which she may be engaged, particularly if it 
consists of light or ornamental needle-work. Politeness, however, re- 
quires that music, drawing, or any occupation which would completely 
engross the attention, be at once abandoned. 

You need not advance to receive visitors when announced, unless they 
are persons to whom you are desirous of testifying particular attention. 
It is sufficient if a lady rises to receive her visitors, moves forward a sin- 
gle step to shake hands with them, and remains standing till they are 
seated. 

When your visitors rise to take leave you should rise also, and remain 
standing till they have quite left the room. 

A lady should dress well, but not too richly, when she pays a morning 
visit 

CONVEESATION. 

There is no conversation so graceful, so varied, so sparkling, as that oil 
an intellectual and cultivated woman. Excellence in this particular is 



CONVERSATION. 243 

indeed, one of the attributes of the sex, and should be cultivated by every 
gentlewoman -\vlio aspires to please in general society. 

In order to talk well, three conditions are indispensable, namely tact, 
a good memory, and a fair education. 

Remember that people take more interest in their own affairs than in 
anything else which you can name. If you wish your conversation to be 
thoroughly agreeable, lead a mother to talk of her children, a young lady 
of her last ball, an author of his forthcoming book, or an artist of his ex- 
hibition picture. Having furnished the topic, you need only listen ; and 
you are sure to be thought not only agreeable, but thoroughly sensible and 
well-informed. 

Be careful, however, on the other hand, not always to make a point of 
talking to persons upon general matters relating to their profession. To 
show an interest in their immediate concerns is flattering ; but to converse 
with them too much about their own arts looks as if you thought them 
ignorant of other topics. 

Remember in conversation that a voice " gentle and low " is, above all 
other extraneous acquirements, " an excellent thing in woman." There is 
a certain distinct but subdued tone of voice which is peculiar to only well- 
bred persons. A loud voice is both disagreeable and vulgar. It is better 
to err by the use of too low rather than too loud a tone. 

Remember that all " slang " is vulgar. 

The use of proverbs is equally vulgar in conversation ; and puns, unless 
they rise to the rank of witticisms, are to be scrupulously avoided. A 
lady-punster is a most unpleasing phenomenon, and we would advise no 
young woman, however witty she may be, to cultivate this kind of verbal 
talent. 

Long arguments in general company, however entertaining to the dis- 
putants, are tiresome to the last degree to all others. You should always 
endeavour to prevent the conversation from dwelling too long upon one 
topic. 

Religion is a topic which should never be introduced into society. It 
is the one subject on which persons are most likely to differ, and least able 
to preserve temper. 

Never interrupt a person who is speaking. It has been aptly said that 
" if you inteiTupt a speaker in the middle of his sentence, you act almost 
as rudely as if, when walking with a companion, you were to thrust your- 
self before him, and stop his progress." 

To listen well is almost as great an art as to talk well. It is not enough 



244 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

only to listen. You must endeavour to seem interested in the conversa- 
tion of others. 

It is considered extremely ill bred when two persons whisper m s< 
or converse in a language with which all present are not familiar, 
have private matters to discuss, you should appoint a proper time and 
place to do so, without paying others the ill compliment of excluding thet 
from your conversation. 

If a foreigner be one of the guests at a small party, and does not und< 
stand English sufficiently to follow what is said, good breeding demands 
that the conversation shall be carried on in his own language, 
dinner-party, the same rule applies to those at his end of the table. 

If upon the entrance of a visitor you carry on the thread of a previous 
conversation, you should briefly recapitulate to him what has been saic 

before he arrived. 

Do not be ahvays witty, even though you should be so happily giJ 
as to need the caution. To outshine others on every occasion is the sure 
road to unpopularity. 

Always look, but never stare, at those with whom you convei 

In order to meet the general needs of conversation in society, it is neces- 
sary that a gentlewoman should be acquainted with the current news and 
historical events of, at least, the last few years. 

Never talk upon subjects of which you know nothing, unless it be : 
the purpose of acquiring information. Many young ladies imagine 
because they play a little, sing a little, draw a little, and frequent exhib 
tions and operas, they are qualified judges of art. No mistake is mor 
egregious or universal. 

Those who introduce anecdotes into their conversation are warne< 
these should invariably be " short, witty, eloquent, new, and not far- 
fetched." 

Scandal is the least excusable of all conversational vulgarities. 

DEESS. 

To dress well requires something more than a full purse and a pretty 
figure It needs taste, good sense, and refinement. Dress may almost be 
classed as one of the tine arts. It is certainly one of those arts the cult: 
vation of which is indispensable to any person moving in the upper or 
middle classes of society. Very clever women are too frequently indifferent 
to the graces of the toilette ; and women who wish to be thought clever 
affect indifference. In the one case it is an error, and in the other a folly. 



DRESS. 



It is not enough that a gentle-women should be clever, or well-educated, or 
wt.-11-born. To take her due place in society, she must be acquainted with 
nil that this little book proposes to teach. She must, above all else, know 
how to enter a room, how to perform a graceful salutation, and how to 
dress. Of these three important qualifications, the most important, because 
the most observed, is the latter. 

Let your style of dress always be appropriate to the hour of the day. 
To dress too finely in the morning, or to be seen in a morning dress in the 
evening, is equally vulgar and out of place. 

Light and inexpensive materials are fittest for morning wear ; dark silk 
dresses for the promenade or carriage ; and low dresses of rich or trans- 
parent stuffs for the dinner and ball. A young lady cannot dress with too 
much simplicity in the early part of the day. A morning dress of some 
simple material, and delicate whole colour, with collar and cuffs of spotless 
linen, is, perhaps, the most becoming and elegant of morning toilettes. 

Never dwes very richly or showily in the street. It attracts attention 
of no enviable kind, and is looked upon as a want of good breeding In 
the carriage a lady may dress as elegantly as she pleases. With respect 
to ball-room toilette, its fashions are so variable, that statements which 
are true of it to-day may be false a month hence. Respecting no institu- 
tion of modern society, is it so difficult to pronounce half-a-dozen perma- 
nent rules. 

We may, perhaps, be permitted to suggest the following leading princi- 
ples ; but we do so with diffidence. Rich colours harmonize with rich 
brunette complexions and dark hair. Delicate colours are the most suita- 
ble for delicate and fragile styles of beauty. Very young ladies are never 
so suitably attired as in white. Ladies who dance should wear dresses of 
light and diaphanous materials, such as tulle, gauze, crape, net, etc., over 
coloured silk slips. Silk dresses are not suitable for dancing. A married 
lady who dances only a fewquadrilles may wear a decolleUe silk dress with 
propriety. 

Very stout persons should never wear white. It has the effect of adding 
to the bulk of the figure. 

Black and scarlet, or black and violet, are worn in mourning. 

A lady in deep mourning should not dance at all. 

However fashionable it may be to wear very long dresses, those ladies 
who go to a ball with the intention of dancing, and enjoying the dance, 
should cause their dresses to be made short enough to clear the ground. 
We would ask them whether it is not better to accept this slight deviation 



246 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

from an absurd fashion, than to appear for three parts of the evening in a 
torn and pinned-up skirt ? 

Well-made shoes, whatever their colour or material, and faultless gloves, 
are indispensable to the effect of a ball-room toilette. 

Much jewellery is out of place ina ball-room. Beautiful flowers, whether 
natural or artificial, are the loveliest ornaments that a lady can wear on 
these occasions. 

At small dinner parties, low dresses are not so indispensable as they 
were held to be some years since. High dresses of transparent materials, 
and low bodices with capes of black lace, are considered sufficiently full 
dress on these occasions. At large dinners only the fullest dress is appro- 
priate. 

Very young ladies should wear but little jewellery. Pearls are deemed 
most appropriate for the young and unmarried. 

Let your jewellery be always the best of its kind. Nothing is so vulgar, 
either in youth or in age, as the use of false ornaments. 

There is as much propriety to be observed in the wearing of jewellery as 
in the wearing of dresses. Diamonds, pearls, rubies, and all transparent 
precious stones, belong to evening dress, and should on no account be worn 
before dinner. In the morning let your rings be of the more simple and 
massive kind ; wear no bracelets; and limit your jewellery to a good brooch, 
gold chain, and watch. Your diamonds and pearls would be as much out 
of place during the morning as a low dress, or a wreath. 

It is well to remember in the choice of jewellery that mere costliness is- 
not always the test of value ; and that an exquisite work of art, such as 
a fine cameo, or a natural rarity, such as black pearl, is a more dwtinguee 
possession than a large brilliant which any rich and tasteless vulgarian can 
buy as easily as yourself. Of all precious stones, the opal is one of the 
most lovely and least common-place. No vulgar woman purchases an opal. 
She invariably prefers the more showy ruby, emerald, or sapphire. 

A true gentlewoman is always faultlessly neat. No richness of toilette 
in the afternoon, no diamonds in the evening, can atone for unbrushed 
hair, a soiled collar, or untidy slippers at breakfast. 

Never be seen in the street without gloves. Your gloves should fit to 
the last degree of perfection. 

In these days of public baths and universal progress, we trust that it is 
unnecessary to do more than hint at the necessity of the most fastidious- 
personal cleanliness. The hair, the teeth, the nails, should be faultlessly 
kept ; and a muslin dress that has been worn once too often, a dingy 
pocket-handkerchief, or a soiled pair of light gloves, are things to be scru- 



MORNING AND EVENING PARTIES. '247 

pulously avoided by any young lady who is ambitious of preserving the 
exterior of a gentlewoman. 

Remember that the make of your corsage is of even greater importance 
than the make of your dress. No dressmaker can fit you well, or make 
your bodices in the manner most becoming to your figure, if the cors<iy>: 
beneath be not of the best description. 

Your shoes and gloves should always be faultless. 

Perfumes should be used only in the evening, and then in moderation. 
Let your perfumes be of the most delicate and recherehr kind. Nothing 
is more vulgar than a coarse, ordinary scent ; and of all coarse ordinary 
scents, the most objectionable are musk and patchouli. 

Finally, every lady should remember that to dress well is a duty which . 
she owes to society ; but that to make it her idol is to commit something 
worse than a folly. Fashion is made for woman ; not woman for fashion. 

MORNING AND EVENING PARTIES. 

The morning party is a modern invention. It was unknown to our fa- 
thers and mothers, and even to ourselves till quite lately. A morning 
party is given during the months of June, July, August, September, and 
sometimes October. It begins about two o'clock and ends about seven, 
and the entertainment consists for the most part of conversation, music, 
and (if there be a garden) croquet, lawn tennis, archery, etc. The refresh- 
ments are given in the form of a dejeAner a, la foarckette. Receptions are 
held during the winter season. 

Elegant morning dress, general good manners, and some acquaintance 
with the topics of the day and the games above named, are all the qualifi- 
cations especially necessary to a lady at a morning party, and " At Homes," 
music and elocution at receptions. 

An evening party begins about nine o'clock p. m., and ends about mid- 
night, or somewhat later. Good-breeding neither demands that you 
should present yourself at the commencement, nor remain till the close of 
the evening. You come and go as may be most convenient ta you, and 
by these means are at liberty, during the height of the season when even- 
ing parties are numerous, to present yourself at two or three houses during 
a single evening. 

When your name is announced, look for the lady of the house, and pay 
your respects to her before you even seem to see any other of your friends 
who may be in the room. At very large and fashionable receptions, the 
hostess is generally to be found near the door. Should you, however, find 



248 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

yourself separated by a dense crowd of guests, you are at literty to recog- 
nise those who are near you, and those whom you encounter as you make 
vour way slowly through the throng. 

If you are at the house of a new acquaintance and find yourself among 
entire strangers, remember that by so meeting under one roof you are all 
in a certain sense made known to one another, and should, therefore, con- 
verse freely as equals. To shrink away to a side-table and affect to be 
absorbed in some album or illustrated work ; or, if you find one unlucky 
acquaintance in the room to fasten upon her like a drowning man clinging 
to a spar, are gaucheries which no shyness can excuse. 

If you possess any musical accomplishment, do not wait to be pressed 
and entreated by your hostess, but comply immediately when she pays 
you the compliment of inviting you to play or sing. Remember, fiowever, 
that only the lady of the house has the right to ask you. If others do so, 
you can put them off in some polite way, but must not comply till the 
hostess herself invites you. 

Be scrupulous to observe silence when any of the company are playing 
or singing. Remember that they are doing this for the amusement of the 
rest ; and that to talk at such a time is as ill-bred as if you were to turn 
your back upon a person who was talking to you and begin a conversation 
with some one else. 

If you are yourself the performer, bear in mind that in music, as in 
speech, " brevity is the soul of wit." Two verses of a song, or four pages 
of a piece, are at all times enough to give pleasure. If your audience de- 
sire more they will ask for it ; and it is infinitely more flattering to be 
encored than to receive the thanks of your hearers, not so much in grati- 
tude for what you have given them, but in relief that you have left oft'. 
You should try to suit your music, like your conversation, to your com- 
pany. A solo of Beethoven's would be as much out of place in some 
circles as a comic song at a Quakers' meeting. To those who only care 
for the light popularities of the season, give Verdi, Suppe", Sullivan, or 
Offenbach. To connoisseurs, if you perform well enough to venture, give 
such music as will be likely to meet the exigencies of a fine taste. Above 
all, attempt nothing that you cannot execute with ease and precision. 

If the party be of a small and social kind and those games called by the 
French les jeux innocents are proposed, do not object to join in them when 
invited. It may be that they demand some slight exercise of wit and 
readiness, and that you do not feel yourself calculated to shine in them ; 
but it is better to seem dull than disagreeable, and those who are obliging 



THE DINNER-PARTY. 249 

can always find some clever neighbour to assist them in the moment of 
need. 

Impromptu charades are frequently organized at friendly parties. Un- 
less you have really some talent for acting and some readiness of speech, 
you should remember that you only put others out and expose your own 
inability by taking part in these entertainments. Of course, if your help 
is really needed, and you would disoblige by refusing, you must do your 
best, and by doing it as quietly and coolly as possible, avoid being awk- 
ward or ridiculous. 

Even though you may take no pleasure in cards, some knowledge of 
the etiquette and rules belonging to the games most in vogue is necessary 
to you in society. If a fourth hand is wanted at euchre, or if the rest of 
the company sit down to a round game, you would be deemed guilty of an 
impoliteness if you refused to join. 

The games most commonly played in society are euchre, draw-poker, 
and whist. 

THE DINNEK-PAETY. 

To be acquainted with every detail of the etiquette pertaining to this 
subject is of the highest importance to every lady. Ease, savoir-faire, 
and good- breeding are nowhere more indispensable than at the dinner- 
table, and the absence of them is nowhere more apparent. How to eat 
soup and what to do with a cherry-stone are weighty considerations when 
taken as the index of social status ; and it is not too much to say, that a 
young woman who elected to take claret with her fish, or ate peas with 
her knife, would justly risk the punishment of being banished from good 
society. 

An invitation to dinner should be replied to immediately, and unequiv- 
ocally accepted or declined. Once accepted, nothing but an event of the 
la>-t importance should cause you to fail in your engagement. 

To be exactly punctual is the strictest politeness on these occasions. If 
you are too early you are in the way ; if too late you spoil the dinner, 
annoy the hostess, and are hated by the rest of the guests. Some author- 
ities are even of opinion that in the question of a dinner party " never " is 
better than " late ;" and one author has gone so far as to say, " if you do 
not reach the house till dinner is served, you had better retire, and send 
an apology, and not interrupt the harmony of the courses by awkward 
excuses and cold acceptance." 

When the party is assembled, the mistress or master of the house will 
point out to each gentleman the lady whom he is to conduct to the table. 



250 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYf LOP.-EDIA. 

The lady who is the greatest stranger should be taken down by the 
master of the house, and the gentleman who is the greatest stranger should 
conduct the hostess. Married ladies take precedence of single ladies, 
elder ladies of younger ones, and so forth. 

When dinner is announced, the host offers his arm to the lady of most 
distinction, invites the rest to follow by a few words or a bow, and leads 
the way. The lady of the house should then follow with the gentleman 
who is most entitled to that honour, and the visitors follow in the order 
that has been previously arranged. The lady of the house frequently re- 
mains, however, till the last, that she may see her guests go in their 
prescribed order ; but the plan is not a convenient one. It is much better 
that the hostess should be in her place as the guests enter the dining-room 
in order that she may indicate their seats to them as they enter, and not 
rind them all crowded together in uncertainty when she arrives. 

The plan of cards, with the names of the guests on them, opposite their 
chairs, is a very useful one. 

The lady of the house takes the head of the table. The gentleman who 
led her down to dinner occupies the seat on her right hand, and the 
gentleman next in order of precedence, that on her left. The master of 
the house takes the foot of the table. The lady whom he escorted sits on 
his right hand, and the lady next in order of precedence on his left. 

As soon as you are seated at table, remove your gloves, place your table 
napkin across your knee, and remove the roll which you will probably find 
within to the left side of your plate. 

The soup should be placed on the table first. All well-ordered dinned 
begin with soup, whether in summer or winter. The lady of the house 
should help it, and send it round without asking each individual in turn. 
It is as much an understood thing as the bread beside each plate, and 
those who do not choose it are always at liberty to leave it untasted. 

In eating soup, remember always to take it from the side of the spoon, 
and to make no sound in doing so. 

If the servants do not go round with wine, the gentlemen should help 
the ladies and themselves to sherry or sauterne immediately after the 
soup. 

You should never ask for a second supply of either soup or fish ; it de- 
lays the next course, and keeps the table waiting. 

Never offer to " assist " your neighbours to this or that dish. The word 
is inexpressible vulgar all the more vulgar for its affectation of elegance. 
" Shall I send you some mutton ? " or " may I help you to canvas back ?" is 
better chosen and better bred. 



'['UK DINNKU-PARTY. 251 

As a general rule, it is better nut to ask your guests if they will partake 
of the dishes; but to send the plates round, and let them accept or decline 
them as they please. At very large dinners it is sometimes customary to 
distribute little lists of the order of the dishes at intervals along the table. 
It must be confessed that this gives somewhat the air of a dinner at an 
hotel ; but it has the advantage of enabling the visitors to select their fare/ 
and, as " forewarned is forearmed," to keep a corner, as the children say 
for their favourite dishes. 

As soon as you "are helped, begin to eat ; or, if the viands are too hot for 
your palate, take up your knife and fork and appear to begin. To wait for 
others is now not only old-fashioned, but ill-bred. 

Never offer to pass on the plate to which you have been helped. 

In helping soup, fish, or any other dish, remember that to overfill a plate 
is as bad as to supply it too scantily. 

Silver fish knives will now always be met with at the best tables ; but 
where there are none, a piece of crust should be taken in the left hand, 
and the fork in the right. There is no exception to this rule in eating fish. 

We presume it is scarcely necessary to remind our fair reader that she 
is never, under any circumstances, to convey her knife to her mouth- 
Peas are eaten with the fork ; tarts, curry, and puddings of all kinds with 
the spoon. 

Always help fish with a fish-slice, and tart and puddings with a spoom 
or, if necessary, a spoon and fork. 

Aspai-agus must be helped with the asparagus-tongs. 

In eating asparagus, it is well to observe what others do, and act ac- 
cordingly. Some very well-bred people eat it with the fingers ; others cut 
off the heads, and convey them to the mouth upon the fork. It would be 
difficult to say which is the more correct. 

In eating stone fruit, such as cherries, damsons, etc., the same rule had 
better be observed. Some put the stones out from the mouth into a spoon 
and so convey them to the plate. Others cover the lips with the hand, 
drop them unseen into the palm, and so deposit them on the side of the 
plate. In our own opinion, the latter is the better way, as it effectually 
conceals the return of the stones, which is certainly the point of highest 
importance. Of one thing we may be sure, and that is, that they must 
never be dropped from the mouth to the plate. 

In helping sauce, always pour it on the side of the plate. 

If the servants do net go round with the wine (which is by far the best 
custom) the gentlemen at a dinner-table should take upon themselves the 
office of helping those ladies who sit near them. 



252 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Unless you are a total abstainer, it is extremely uncivil to decline taking 
wine if you are invited to do so. 

It is particularly ill-bred to empty your glass on these occasions. 

Certain wines are taken with certain dishes, by old-established custom 
as sherry or sauterne, with soup and fish ; hock and claret with roast 
meat ; punch with turtle ; champagne with sweet-bread or cutlets ; port 
with venison ; port or burgundy with game ; sparkling wines between the 
roast and the confectionery ; madeira with sweets ; port with cheese ; and 
for dessert, port, tokay, madeira, sherry, and claret. Red wines should 
never be iced, even in summer. Claret and burgundy should always 
be slightly warmed ; claret-cup and champagne should, of course, be 
iced. 

Instead of cooling their wines in the ice-pail, some hosts introduce clear 
ice upon the table, broken up in small lumps, to be put inside the glasses. 
This cannot be too strictly reprehended. Melting ice can but weaken the 
quality and flavour of the wine. Those who desire to drink wine and 
water can ask for iced water if they choose ; but it savors too much of 
economy on the part of a host to insinuate the ice inside the glasses of 
his guests when the wine could be more effectually iced outside the 
bottle. 

A silver knife and fork should be placed to each guest at dessert. 

It is wise never to partake of any dish without knowing of what in- 
gredients it is composed. You can always ask the servant who hands it 
to you, and you thereby avoid all danger of having to commit the impo- 
liteness of leaving it, and showing that you do not approve of it. 

Never speak while you have anything in your mouth. 

Be careful never to taste soups or puddings till you are sure they are 
sufficiently cool ; as, by disregarding this caution, you may be compelled 
to swallow what is dangerously hot, or be driven to the unpardonable 
alternative of returning it to your plate. 

When eating or drinking, avoid every kind of audible testimony to the 
fact. 

Finger-glasses, containing water slightly warmed and perfumed, are 
placed to each person at dessert. In these you may dip the tips of your 
fingers, wiping them afterwards on your table-napkin. If the finger-glass 
and doyley are placed on your dessert-plate, you should immediately 
remove the doyley to the left of your plate, and place the finger-glass upon 
it. By these means you leave the right for the wine-glasses. 

Be careful to know the shapes of the various kinds of wine-glasses com- 
monly in use, in order that you may never put forward one for another. 



THK DINNER-PARTY. 

High and narrow, and very broad and shallow glasses, are used for cham- 
pagne ; large goblet-shaped glasses for burgundy and claret; ordinary 
wine-glasses for sherry and madeira; green glasses for hock; and some- 
what large, bell-shaped glasses for port. 

Port, sherry, and madeira are decanted. Hocks and champagnes appear 
in their native bottles. Claret and burgundy are handed round in a claivt- 



The servants leave the room when the dessert is on the table. 

Coffee and liqueurs should be handed round when the dessert has been 
about a quarter of an hour on the table. After this the ladies generally 
retire. 

The lady of the house should never send away her plate, or appear to 
have done eating, till all her guests have finished. 

If you should unfortunately overtm-n or break anything, do not apolo- 
gize for it. You can show your regret in your face, but it is not well-bred 
to put it into words. 

To abstain from taking the last piece on the dish, or the last glass of 
wine in the decanter, only because it is the last, is highly ill-bred. It 
implies a fear on your part that the vacancy cannot be supplied, and almost 
conveys an affront to your host. 

To those ladies who have houses and servants at command, we have one 
or two remarks to offer. Every housekeeper should be acquainted with 
the routine of a dinner and the etiquette of a dinner-table. No lady should 
be utterly dependent on the taste and judgment of her cook. Though she 
need not know how to dress a dish, she should be able to judge of it when 
served. The mistress of the house, in short, should be to a cook what a 
publisher is to his authors that is to say, competent to form a judgment 
upon their works, though himself incapable of writing even a magazine 
article. 

If you wish to have a good dinner, and do not know in what manner to 
set about it, you will do wisely to order it from some first-rate restaura- 
teur. By these means you insure the best cookery and a faultless carte. 

Bear in mind that it is your duty to entertain your friends in the best 
manner that your means permit. This is the least you can do to recom- 
pense them for the expenditure of time and money which they incur in 
accepting your invitation. 

" To invite a friend to dinner," says Brillat Savarin, " is to become res- 
ponsible for his happiness so long as he is under your roof." 

A dinner, to be excellent, need not consist of a great variety of dishes ; 
but everything should be of the best, and the cookery should be perfect, 



254 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

That which should be cool should be cool as ice ; that which should be 
hot should be smoking ; the attendance should be rapid and noiseless ; the 
guests well assorted ; the wines of the best quality ; the host attentive and 
courteous ; the room well lighted, and the time punctual. 

Every dinner should begin with soup, be followed by fish, and include 
some kind of game. " The soup is to the dinner," we are told by Grisnod 
de la Regniere, " what the portico is to a building, or the overture to an 
opera." 

To this aphorism we may be permitted to add that a ckasse of cognac 
or curagoa at the close of a dinner is like the epilogue at the end of a 
comedy. 

Never reprove or give directions to your servants before guests. If a 
dish is not placed precisely where you would have wished it to stand, or 
the order of a course is reversed, let the error pass unobserved by yourself, 
and you may depend that it will be unnoticed by others. 

The duties of hostess at a dinner-party are not onerous ; but they de- 
mand tact and good breeding, grace of bearing, and self-possession of no 
ordinary degree. She does not often carve. She has no active duties to 
perform ; but she must neglect nothing, forget nothing, put all her guests 
at their ease, encourage the timid, draw out the silent, and pay every 
possible attention to the requirements of each and all around her. No 
accident must ruffle her temper. No disappointment must embarrass her. 
She must see her old china broken without a sigh, and her best glass shat- 
tered with a smile. 

STAYING AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE-BREAKFAST, LUNCHEON, 

ETC. 

A visitor is bound by the laws of social intercourse to conform in all 
respects to the habits of the house. In order to do this effectually, she 
should inquire, or cause her personal servant to inquire, what those habits 
are. To keep your friend's breakfast on the table till a late hour ; to delay 
the dinner by want of punctuality ; to accept other invitations, and treat 
his house as if it were merely an hotel to be slept in ; or to keep the 
family up till unwonted hours, are alike evidences of a want of good feel- 
ing and good -breeding. 

At breakfast and lunch absolute punctuality is not imperative ; but a 
visitor should avoid being always the last to appear at table. 

No order of precedence is observed at either breakfast or luncheon. 
Persons take their seats as they come in, and, having exchanged their 



I;I:M:KAI. HINTS. .,-- 

morning salutations, begin to eat without waiting for the rest of the partv. 

If letters are delivered to you at breakfast or luncheon, 3-011 may read 
them by asking permission from the lady who presides at the urn. 

Always hold yourself at the disposal of those in whose house you are 
visiting. If they propose to ride, drive, walk, or otherwise occupy the day, 
may take it for granted that these plans are made with reference to 
your enjoyment, You should, therefore, receive them with cheerfuln- 
enter into them with alacrity, and do your best to seem pleassd, and be 
pleased, by the efforts which your friends make to entertain you. 

You should never take a book from the library to your own room with- 
out requesting permission to borrow it. When it is lent, you should take 
every care that it sustains no injury while in your possession, and should 
cover it, if necessary. 

A guest should endeavour to amuse herself as much as possible, and not 
be continually dependent on her hosts for entertainment. She should 
remember that, however welcome she'may be, she is not always wanted. 

A visitor should avoid giving unnecessary trouble to the servants of the 
house. 

The signal for retiring to rest is generally given by the appearance of 
the servant with wine, water, and biscuits, where a late dinner hour is 
observed, and suppers are not the custom. This is the last refreshment of 
the evening, and the visitor will do well to rise and wish good night shortly 
after it has been partaken of by the family. 

GENEKAL HINTS. 

Do not frequently repeat the name of the person with whom you are 
conversing. It implies either the extreme of hauteur or familiarity. 

Never speak of absent persons by only their Christian or surnames; but 

always as Mr. , or Mrs. . Above all, never name anybody by the 

first letter of his name. Married people are sometimes guilty of this 
flagrant offence against taste. 

Look at those who address you. 

Never boast of your birth, your money, your grand friends, or anything 
that is yours. If you have travelled, do not introduce that information 
into your conversation at every opportunity. Any one can travel with 
money and leisure. The real distinction is to come home with enlarged 
views, improved tastes, and a mind free from prejudice. 

If you present a book to a friend, do not write his or her name in it,

any the more valuable for that addition ; and you ought not to conclude 
beforehand that your gift will be accepted. 

Never undervalue the gift which you are yourself offering ; you have 
no business to offer it if it is valueless. Neither say that you do not want 
it yourself, or that you should throw it away if it were not accepted, etc., 
etc. Such apologies would be insults if true, and mean nothing if false. 

No compliment that bears insincerity on the face of it, is a compliment 

at all. 

Presents made by a married lady to a gentleman can only be offered in 
the joint names of her husband and herself. 

Married ladies may occasionally accept presents from gentlemen who 
visit frequently at their houses, and who desire to show their sense of the 
hospitality which they receive there. 

Acknowledge the receipt of a present without delay. 

Give a foreigner his name in full, as Monsieur de Vigny never as Mon- 
sieur only. In speaking of him, give him his title, if he has one. 

Converse with a foreigner in his own language. If not competent to do 
so, apologize, and beg permission to speak English. 

To <*et in and out of a carriage gracefully is a simple but important 
accomplishment. If there is but one step, and you are going to take the 
seat facing the horses, put your left foot on the step, and enter the carri- 
age with your right, in such a manner as to drop at once into your seat. 
If you are about to sit with your back to the horses, reverse the process. 
As you step into the carriage, be careful to keep your back towards the 
seat you are about to occupy, so as to avoid the awkwardness of turning 
when you are once in. 




"ANGLING." 



(Etiquette for (gentlemen. 



c/r^ 




INTRODUCTIONS. 



introduce persons who are nuftually'unknown is to under- 
take a serious responsibility, and to certify to each the 
respectability of the other. Never undertake this respon- 
sibility without in the first place asking yourself whether 
the persons are likely to be agreeable to each other ; nor, 
in the second place, without ascertaining whether it will 
be acceptable to both parties to become acquainted. 

Always introduce the gentleman to the lady never 
the lady to the gentleman. The chivalry of etiquette 
assumes that the lady is invariably the superior in right of her sex, and 
that the gentleman is honoured by the introduction. 

Never present a gentleman to a lady without first asking her permis- 
sion to do so. 

When you are introduced to a lady, never offer your hand. When 
introduced, persons limit their recognition of each other with a bow. 

Pei-sons who have met at the house of a mutual friend without being 
introduced, should not bow if they afterwards meet elsewhere; a bow 
implies acquaintance, and persons who have not been introduced are not 
acquainted. 

If you are walking with one friend, and presently meet with, or are 
joined by, a second, do not commit the too frequent error of introducing 
them to each other. You have even less right to do so than if they 
encountered each other at your house during a morning call. 

There are some exceptions to the etiquette of introductions. At a ball 
or evening party, where there is dancing, the mistress of the house may 
introduce any gentleman to any lady without first asking the lady's per- 
mission. But she should first ascertain whether the lady is willing to 
dance ; and this out of consideration for the gentleman, who may other- 
wise be refused. No man likes to be refused the hand of a lady, though 
it be only for a quadrille. 

Q 



258 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

A brother may present his sister, or a father his sou, without any kind 
of preliminary : but only when there is no inferiority on the part of his 
own family to that of the acquaintance. 

Friends may introduce friends at the house of a mutual acquaintance, 
but, as a rule, it is better to be introduced by the mistress of the house. 
Such an introduction carries more authority with it. 

Introductions at evening parties are now almost wholly dispensed with. 
Persons who meet at a friend's house are ostensibly upon an equality, and 
pay a bad compliment to the host by appearing suspicious and formal. 
Some old-fashioned country hosts yet persevere in introducing each new- 
comer to all the assembled guests. It is a custom that cannot be too soon 
abolished, and one that places the last unfortunate visitor in a singularly 
awkward position. All that he can do is to make a semicircular bow, 
like a concert singer before an audience, and bear the general gaze with as 
much composure as possible. 

If, when entering the drawing-room, your name has been wrongly 
announced, or has passed unheard in the buzz of conversation, make your 
way at once to the mistress of the house, if you are a stranger, and intro- 
duce yourself by name. This should be done with the greatest simplic- 
ity, and your professional or titular rank made as little of as possible. 

An introduction given at a ball for the mere purpose of conducting a 
lady through a dance does not give the gentleman any right to bow to 
her on a future occasion. If he commits this error, he must remember 
that she is not bound to see or return his salutation. 

LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION. 

Do not lightly give or promise letters of introduction. Always remem- 
ber that when you give a letter of introduction you lay yourself under an 
obligation to the friend to whom it is addressed. 

No one delivers a letter of introduction in person. It places you in the 
most undignified position imaginable, and compels you to wait while it is 
being read, like a footman who has been told to wait for an answer. 

If, on the other hand, a stranger sends you a letter of introduction and 
his card, you are bound by the laws of politeness and hospitality, not only 
to call upon him the next day, but to follow up that attention with others. 
If you are in a position to do so, the most correct proceeding is to invite 
him to dine with you. Should this not be within your power, you have 
probably the entree to some private collections, club-houses, theatres, or 
reading-rooms, and could devote a few hours to showing him these 
places. 



VI SITING -MORNING CALLS-CARDS. 0.59 

A letter of introduction should be given unsealed, not alone because 
your friend may wish to know what you have said of him, but also as a 
guarantee of your own good faith. As you should never give such a letter 
unless you can speak highly of the bearer, this rule of etiquette is easy to 
observe. By requesting your friend to fasten the envelope before for- 
warding the letter to its destination you tacitly give him permission to 
inspect its contents. 

Let your note paper be of the best quality and proper size. 

VISITLNG-MOKNINa CALLS-CAEDS. 

A morning visit should be paid between the hours of 2 and 4 P.M. in 
winter, and -1 and 5 in summer. 

Visits of ceremony should be short. If even your conversation should 
become animated, beware of letting your call exceed half an hour's length. 
It is always better to let your friends regret rather than desire your 
withdrawal. 

On returning visits of ceremony you may, without impoliteness, leave 
your card at the door without going in. Do not fail, however, to inquire 
if the family be well. 

Should there be daughters or sisters residing with the lady upon whom 
you call, you may turn down a corner of your card, to signify that the 
visit is paid to all. It is in better taste, however, to leave cards for each. 

Unless when returning thanks for " kind inquiries," or announcing your 
arrival in, or departure from, town, it is not considered respectful to send 
cards round by a servant. 

Leave-taking cards have P.P.C. (pour prendre conge) written in the 
corner. Some use P.D.A. (pour dire adieu). 

The visiting cards of gentlemen are half the size of those used by 
ladies. 

Visits of condolence are paid within the week after the event which 
occasions them. Personal visits of this kind are made by relations and 
very intimate friends only. Acquaintances should leave cards with nar- 
row mourning borders. 

On the first occasion, when you are received by the family after the 
death of one of its members, it is etiquette to wear slight mourning. 

When a gentleman makes a morning call, he should never leave his hat 
or riding-whip in the hall, but should take both into the room. To do 
otherwise would be to make himself too much at home. The hat, how- 
ever, must never be laid on a table, piano, or any article of furniture, it 



2GO 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



should be held gracefully in the hand. If you are compelled to lay it 
aside put it on the floor. 

Umbrellas should invariably be left in the hall. 

Never take favourite dogs into a drawing-room when you make a mor- 
ning call. Their feet may be dusty, or they may bark at the sight of 
strangers, or, being of too friendly a disposition, may take the liberty of 
lying on a lady's gown, or jumping on the sofas and easy chairs. Where 
your friend has a favourite cat already established before the fire, a battle 
may ensue, and one or both of the pets be seriously hurt. Besides, many 
persons have a constitutional antipathy to dogs, and others never allow 
their own to be seen in the sitting-rooms. For all or any of those reasons, 
a visitor has no right to inflict upon his friend the society of his dog a* 

well as of himself. 

If, when you call upon a lady, you meet a lady visitor m her drawing- 
room, you should rise when that lady takes her leave. 

If other visitors are announced, and you have already remained as long 
as courtesy requires, wait till they are seated, and then rise from your 
chair, take leave of your hostess, and bow politely to the newly-arrived 
guests. You will, perhaps, be urged to remain, but, having once risen, it 
is always best to go. There is always a certain air of gaucherie in resum- 
intf your seat and repeating the ceremony of leave-taking. 

If you have occasion to look at your watch during a call, ask permis- 
sion to do so, and apologize for it on the plea of other appointments 

CONVEESATION. 

Let your conversation be adapted as skilfully as may be to your com- 
pany Some men make a point of talking commonplace to all 
alike as if a woman could only be a trifler. Others, on the contrary, for- 
get in what respects the education of a lady differs from that of a ger 
man and commit the opposite error of conversing on topics with which 
ladies are seldom acquainted. A woman of sense has as much right to b< 
annoyed by the one, as a lady of ordinary education by the other, 
cannot pay a finer compliment to a woman of refinement and esprit 
by leading the conversation into such a channel as may mark your appn 
ciation of her superior attainments. 

In talking with ladies of ordinary education, avoid political, si 
or commercial topics, and choose only such subjects as are 
of interest to them. 

Remember that people take more interest in their own affair; 
anything else which you can name. If you wish your conversatu 



roXVKUSATIOX. 2G1 

thoroughly agreeable, lead a mother to talk of her children, a young lady 
of her last ball, an author of his forthcoming book, or an artist of his 
exhibition picture. Having furnished the topic, you need only listen 
and you are sure to be thought not only agreeable but thoroughly sen- 
sible and well-informed. 

Be careful, however, on the other hand, not always to make a point of 
talking to persons upon general matters relating to their professions. To 
show an interest in their immediate concerns is flattering; but to con- 
verse with them too much about their own arts looks as if you thought 
them ignorant of other topics. 

Do not use a classical quotation in the presence of ladies without apolo- 
gizing for, or translating, it. Even this should only be done when no 
other phrase would so aptly express your meaning. Whether in the 
presence of ladies or gentlemen, much display of learning is pedantic and 
out of place. 

There is a certain distinct but subdued tone of voice which is peculiar 
to only well-bred persons. A loud voice is both disagreeable and vulgar. 
It is better to err by the use of too low rather than too loud a tone. 

Remember that all " slang " is vulgar. 

Do not pun. Puns unless they rise to the rank of witticisms, are to bo 
scrupulously avoided. 

Long arguments in general company, however entertaining to the dis- 
putants, are tiresome to the last degree to all others. You should always 
endeavour to prevent the conversation from dwelling too long upon one 
topic. 

Religion is a topic which should never be introduced in society. It is 
the one subject on which persons are most likely to differ, and least able 
to preserve temper. 

Never interrupt a person who is speaking. 

To listen well, is almost as great an art as to talk well. It is not 
enough only to listen. You must endeavour to seem interested in the 
conversation of others. 

It is considered extremely ill-bred when persons whisper in society, 
or converse in a language in which all present are not familiar. If you 
have private matters to discuss you should appoint a proper time and 
place to do so, without paying others the ill compliment of excluding 
them from your conversation. 

If a foreigner be one of the guests at a small party, and does not under- 
stand English sufficiently to follow what is said, good-breeding demands 



262 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

that the conversation shall be carried on in his own language. If at a, 
dinner party, the same rule applies to those at his end of the table. 

If upon the entrance of a visitor you carry on the thread of a previous 
conversation, you should briefly recapitulate to him what has been said 
before he arrived. 

Always look, but never stare, at those with whom you converse. 

In order to meet the general needs of conversation in society, it is 
necessary that a man should be well acquainted with the current news 
and historical events of at least the last few years. 

Never talk upon subjects of which you know nothing, unless it be for 
the purpose of acquiring information. Many young men imagine that 
because they frequent exhibitions and operas they are qualified judges of 
art. No mistake is more egregious or universal. 

Those who introduce anecdotes into their conversation are warned that 
these should invariably be "short, witty, eloquent, new, and not far- 
fetched." 

Scandal is the least excusable of all conversational vulgarities. 

In conversing with a man of rank, do not too frequently give him his 
title. 

THE PROMENADE. 

A well-bred man must entertain no respect for the brim of his hat. 
" A bow," says La Fontaine, " is a note drawn at sight." You are bound 
to acknowledge it immediately, and to the full amount. True politeness 
demands that the hat should be quite lifted from the head. 

On meeting friends with whom you are likely to shake hands remove 
your hat with the left hand in order to leave the right hand free. 

If you meet a lady in the street whom you are sufficiently intimate to 
address, do not stop her, but turn round and walk beside her in which- 
ever direction she is going. When you have said all that you wish to 
say, you can take your leave. 

If you meet a lady with whom you are not particularly well acquainted, 
wait for her recognition before you venture to bow to her. 

In bowing to a lady whom you are not going to address, lift your hat 
with that hand which is farthest from her. For instance, if you pass 
her on the right side, use your left hand ; if on the left, use your right. 
If you are on horseback and wish to converse with a lady who is on 
foot, you must dismount and lead your horse, so as not to give her the 
fatigue of looking up to your level. Neither should you subject her to 
the impropriety of carrying on a conversation in a tone necessarily louder 
than is sanctioned in public by the laws of good breeding. 



DRESS. -203 

When you meet friends or acquaintances in the streets, at the exhibi- 
tions, or any public places, take care not to pronounce their names so 
loudly as to attract the attention of the passers-by. Never call aci < 
the street ; and never carry on a dialogue in a public vehicle, unless your 
interlocutor occupies the seat beside your own. 

In walking with a lady take charge of any small parcel, parasol, or 
book with which she may be encumbered. 

DRESS. 

A gentleman should always be so well dressed that his dress shall never 
be observed at all. Does this sound like an enigma ? It is not meant 
for one. It only implies that perfect simplicity is perfect elegance, and 
that the true test of taste in the toilet of a gentleman is its entire har- 
mony, unobtrusiveness, and becomingness. If any friend should say to 
you, " What a handsome waistcoat you have on ! " you may depend that 
a less handsome waistcoat would be in better taste. If you hear it said 
that Mr. So and-So wears superb jewellery, you may conclude beforehand 
that he wears too much. Display, in short, is ever to be avoided, especi- 
ally in matters of dress. The toilet is the domain of the fair sex. Let a 
wise man leave its graces and luxuries to his wife, daughters, or sisters, 
and seek to be himself appreciated for something of higher worth than 
the stud in his shirt or the trinkets on his chain. 

To be too much in the fashion is as vulgar as to be too far behind it. 
No really well-bred man follows every new cut that he sees in his tailor's 
fashion-book. 

In the morning wear frock coats, double-breasted waistcoats, and trou- 
sers of light or dark colours, according to the season. 

In the evening, though only in the bosom of your own family, wear 
only black, and be as scrupulous to put on a dress coat as if you expected 
visitors. If you have sons, bring them up to do the same. It is the 
observance of these minor trifles in domestic etiquette which marks the 
true gentleman. 

For evening parties, dinner parties, and balls, wear a black dress coat, 
black trousers, black silk or cloth waistcoat, white cravat, white or grey 
kid gloves, and thin patent leather boots. A black cravat may be worn 
in full dress, but is not so elegant as a white one. 

Let your jewellery be of the best, but the least gaudy description, and 
wear it very sparingly. A single stud, a gold watch and guard, and one 
handsome ring, are as many ornaments as a gentleman can wear with 
propriety. 



264 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

It is well to remember in the choice of jewellery that mere costliness 
is not always the test of value ; and that an exquisite work of art, such 
as a fine cameo, or a natural rarity, such as a black pearl, is a more dis- 
tingue possession than a large brilliant, which any rich and tasteless vul- 
garian can buy as easily as yourself. For a ring, the gentleman of fine 
taste would prefer a precious antique intaglio to the handsomest diamond 
or ruby that could be bought at Tiffany's. 

Of all precious stones, the opal is one of the most lovely and the least 
commonplace. No vulgar man purchases an opal. He invariably prefers 
the more showy diamond, ruby, sapphire, or emerald. 

Unless you are a snuff-taker, never carry any but a white pocket- 
handkerchief. 

In the morning you wear a long cravat fastened by a pin, be careful to 
avoid what may be called alliteration of colour. We have seen a tur- 
quoise pin worn in a violet-coloured cravat, and the effect was frightful. 
Choose, if possible, complementary colours, and their secondaries. For 
instance, if the stone in your pin be torquoise, wear it with brown, or 
crimson mixed with black, or black and orange. If a ruby, contrast it 
with shades of green. The same rule holds good with regard to the mix- 
ture and contrast of colours in your waistcoat and cravat. Thus, a buff 
waistcoat and blue tie, or brown and blue, or brown and green, or brown 
and magenta, green and magenta, green and mauve, are all good arrange- 
ments of colour. 

Coloured shirts may be worn in the morning, but they should be small 
in pattern and quiet in colour. 

In these days of public baths and universal progress, we trust that it is 
unnecessary to do more than hint at the necessity of the most fastidious 
personal cleanliness. The hair, the teeth, the nails, should be faultlessly 
kept ; and a soiled shirt, a dingy pocket-handkerchief, or a light waist- 
coat that has been worn once too often, are things to be scrupulously 
avoided by any man who is ambitious of preserving the exterior of a 
gentleman. 

BIDING AND DRIVING. 

Riding, as in walking, give the lady the wall. 

If you assist a lady to mount, hold your hand at a convenient distance 
from the ground that she may place her foot in it. As she springs, you 
aid her by the impetus of your hand. In doing this, it is always better 
to agree upon a signal, that her spring and your assistance may come at 
the same moment. 



MORJfIX<; AND KVKXIN'i; PAKTIKS. 

For this purpose there is no better form than the old duelling one of 
" one, two, three" 

When the lady is in the saddle, it is your place to find the stirrup for 
her, and guide her left foot to it. When this is done, she rises in her seat 
and you assist her to draw her habit straight. 

Even when a groom is present, it is more polite for the gentleman him- 
self to perform this office for his fair companion ; as it would be more 
polite for him to hand her a chair than to have it handed by a servant. 

If the lady be light, you must take care not to give her too much im- 
petus in mounting. We have known a lady nearly thrown over her horse 
by a misplaced zeal of this kind. 

If the gate has to be opened, we need hardly observe that it is your 
place to hold it open till the lady has passed through. 

In driving, a gentleman places himself with his back to the horses, and 
leaves the best seat for the ladies. 

When the carriage stops, the gentleman should alight first, in order to 
as-ist the lady. 

To get in and out of a carriage gracefully is a simple but important 
accomplishment. If there is but one step, and you are going to take your 
seat facing the horses, put your left foot on the step, and enter the carriage 
with your right in such a manner as to drop at once into your seat. If 
you are about to sit with your back to the horses, reverse the process. As 
you step into the carriage be careful to keep your back towards the seat 
you are about to occupy, so as to avoid the awkwardness of turning when 
you are once in. 

A gentleman cannot be too careful to avoid stepping on ladies' dresses 
when he gets in or out of a carriage. He should also beware of shutting 
them in with the door. 

MORNING- AND EVENING PAETIES. 

Elegant morning dress, general good manners, and some acquaintance 
with the topics of the day and the games above named, are all the quali- 
fications especially necessary to a gentleman at a morning party. 

An evening party begins about nine o'clock P.M., and ends about mid- 
night, or somewhat later. Good breeding neither demands that you 
should present yourself at the commencement nor remain till the close of 
the evening. You come and go as may be most convenient for you, and 
by these means are at liberty, during the height of the season when even- 



2G6 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ing parties are numerous, to present yourself at two or three houses dur- 
ing a single evening. 

At very large and fashionable receptions, the hostess is generally to be 
found near the door. Should you, however, find yourself separated by a 
dense crowd of guests, you are at liberty to recognise those who are near 
you, and those whom you encounter as you make your way slowly 
through the throng. 

If you are at the house of a new acquaintance and find yourself among 
entire strangers, remember that by so meeting under one roof you are all 
in a certain sense made known to one another, and should therefore con- 
verse freely, as equals. To shrink away to some side-table and affect to 
be absorbed in some album or illustrated work; or, if you find one 
unlucky acquaintance in the room, to fasten upon him like a drowning 
man clinging to a spar, are gaucheries which no shyness can excuse. An 
easy and unembarrassed manner, and the self-possession requisite to open 
a conversation with those who happen to be near you, are the indispen- 
sable credentials of a well-bred man. 

At an evening party, do not remain too long in one spot. To be afraid 
to move from one drawing-room to another is the sure sign of a neophyte 
in society. 

If you have occasion to use your handkerchief, do so as noiselessly as 
possible. To blow your nose as if it were a trombone, or to turn your head 
aside when using your handkerchief, are vulgarities scrupulously to be 
avoided. 

Never stand upon the hearth with your back to the fire or stove, either 
in a friend's house or your own. 

Never offer anyone the chair from which you have just risen, unless 
there is no other disengaged. 

If, when supper is announced, no lady has been specially placed under 
your care by the hostess, offer your arm to whichever lady you may have 
last conversed with. 

If you possess any musical accomplishments, do not wait to be pressed 
and entreated by your hostess, but comply immediately when she pays 
you the compliment of inviting you to play or sing. Remember, however, 
that only the lady of the house has the right to ask you. If others do so, 
you can put them off in some polite way ; but must not comply till the 
hostess herself invites you. 

If you sing comic songs, be careful that they are of the most unexcep- 
tionable kind, and likely to offend neither the tastes nor prejudices of the 
society in which you find yourself. 



MORNING AND EVENING PARTIES. 2G7 

If the party be of a small and social kind, and those games called by 
the French lex jeux innocents are proposed, do not object to join in them 
when invited. It may be that they demand some slight exercise of wit 
and readiness, and that you do not feel yourself calculated to shine in 
them ; but it. is better to seem dull than disagreeable, and those who are 
obliging can always find some clever neighbour to assist them in the 
moment of need. The game of " consequences " is one which unfortunately 
jives too much scope to liberty of expression. If you join in this game, 
we cannot too earnestly enjoin you never to write down one word which 
the must pure-minded woman present might not read aloud without a 
blush. Jests of an equivocal character are not only vulgar, but con- 
temptible. 

Impromptu charades are frequently organized at friendly parties. 
Unless you have really some talent for acting and some readiness of speech, 
you should remember that you only put others out and expose your own 
inability by taking part in these entertainments. Of course, if your help 
is really needed and you would disoblige by refusing, you must do your 
best, and by doing it as quietly and coolly as possible, avoid being awk- 
ward or ridiculous. 

Should an impromptu polka or quadrille be got up after supper at a 
party where no dancing was intended, be sure not to omit putting on 
Cloves before you stand up. It is well always to have a pair of white 
gloves in your pocket in case of need; but even black are better undei 
these circumstances than none. 

Even though you may take no pleasure in cards, some knowledge of the 
etiquette and rules belonging to the games most in vogue is necessary to 
you in society. 

Never let even politeness induce you to play for high stakes. Etiquette 
is the minor morality of life ; but it never should be allowed to outweigh 
the higher code of right and wrong. 

Be scrupulous to observe silence when any of the company are playing 
or singing. Remember that they are doing this for the amusement of the 
rest ; and that to talk at such a time is as ill-bred as if you were to turn 
your back upon a person who was talking to you, and begin a conversa- 
tion with someone else. 

If you are yourself the performer, bear in mind that in music, as in 
speech, " brevity is the soul of wit." Two verses of a song, or four pages 
of a piece, are at all times enough to give pleasure. If your audience 
desire more they will ask for it; and it is infinitely more nattering to be 
encored than to receive the thanks of your hearers, not so much in grati- 



268 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

tude for what you have given them, but in relief that you have left off. 
You should try to suit your music, like your conversation, to your com- 
pany. A solo of Beethoven's would be as much out of place in some 
circles as a comic song at a Quaker's meeting. To those who only care 
for the light popularities of the season, give Verdi. To connoisseurs, if 
you perform well enough to venture, give such music as will be likely to 
meet the exigencies of a fine taste. Above all, attempt nothing that you 
cannot execute with ease and precision. 

In retiring from a crowded party it is unnecessary that you should seek 
out the hostess for the purpose of bidding her a formal good-night. By 
doing this you would, perhaps, remind others that it was getting late, and 
cause the party to break up. If you meet the lady of the house on your 
way to the drawing-room door, take your leave of her as unobstrusively as 
possible, and slip away without attracting the attention of her other 
guests. 

THE DfflNZR TABLE. 

To be acquainted with every detail of the etiquette pertaining to this 
subject is of the highest importance to every gentleman. Ease, savoir 
Jaire, and good-breeding are nowhere more indispensable than at the din- 
ner-table, and the absence of them is nowhere more apparent. 

An invitation to dine should be replied to immediately, and unequivo- 
cally accepted or declined. Once accepted, nothing but an event of the 
last importance should cause you to fail in your engagement. 

To be exactly punctual is the strictest politeness on these occasions. If 
you are too early, you are in the way ; if too late, you spoil the dinner, 
annoy the hostess, and are hated by the rest of the guests. Some auth- 
orities are even of opinion that in the question of a dinner party, " never " 
is better than " late " ; and one author has gone so far as to say, " if you 
<lo not reach the house till dinner is served, you had better retire to a 
restaurateur's, and thence send an apology, and not interrupt the har- 
mony of the courses by awkward excuses and cold acceptance." 

When the party is assembled, the mistress or master of the house will 
point out to each gentleman the lady whom he is to conduct to the table. 
If she be a stranger, you had better seek an introduction ; if a previous 
acquaintance, take care to be near her when the dinner is announced ; 
offer your arm, and go down according to precedence. This order of pre- 
cedence must be arranged by the host or hostess. 

When the dinner is announced, the host offers his arm to the lady of 
most distinction, invites the rest to follow by a few words or a bow, and

leads the way. The lady of the house should then follow with the gen- 
tleman who is most entitled to that honour, and the visitors follow in the 
order that the master of the house has previously arranged. The lady of 
the house frequently remains however, till the last, that she may see her 
guests go down in the prescribed order ; but the plan is not a convenient 
one. It is much better that the hostess should be in her place as the 
guests enter the dining-room, in order that she may indicate their seats 
to them as they come in, and not find them all crowded together in uncer- 
tainty when she arrives. If cards with names are on the table seek that 
of the lady whom you have taken to dinner. 

The number of guests at a dinner-party should always be determined 
by the size of the table. When the party is too small, conversation 
flags, and a general air of desolation pervades the table. When they are 
too many, everyone is inconvenienced. A space of two feet should be al- 
lowed to each person. It is well to arrange a party in such wise that the 
number of ladies and gentlemen be equal. 

The lady of the house takes the head of the table. The gentleman who 
led her down to dinner occupies the seat on her right hand, and the gen- 
tlcman next in order of precedence that on her left. The master of the 
house takes the foot of the table. The lady whom he escorted sits on his 
right hand, and the lady next in order of precedence on his left. 

The gentlemen who support the lady of the house should offer to relieve 
her of the duties of hostess. Many ladies are well pleased thus to dele- 
gate the difficulties of carving, and all gentlemen who accept invitations 
to dinner should be prepared to render such assistance when called upon. 
To offer to carve a dish, and then perform the office unskilfully, is an un- 
pardonable yaucherie. Every gentleman should carve, and carve well. 

As soon as you are seated at the table, remove your gloves, place your 
table napkin across your knees, and remove the roll which you find prob- 
ably within it to the left side of your plate. 

The soup should be placed on the table first. 

In eating soup, remember always to take it from the side of the spoon, 
and to make no sound in doing so. 

If the servants do not go round with wine the gentlemen should help the 
ladies and themselves to sherry or sauterne immediately after the soup. 

You should never ask for a second supply of either soup or fish ; it 
delays the next course and keeps the table waiting. 

Never offer to " assist " your neighbours to this or that dish. The word 
is inexpressibly vulgar all the more vulgar for its affectation of elegance. 



270 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

<( Shall I send you some mutton ? " or " may I help you to canvas-back ? " 
is better chosen and better bred. 

If you are asked to take wine, it is polite to select the same as that 
which your interlocutor is drinking. If you invite a lady to take wine, 
you should ask her which she will prefer, and then take the same your- 
self. Should you, however, for any reason prefer some other vintage, you 
can take it by courteously requesting her permission. 

As soon as you are helped, begin to eat ; or, if the viands are too hot 
for your palate, take up your knife and fork and appear to begin. To 
wait for others is now not only old-fashioned, but ill-bred. 

Never offer to pass on the plate to which you have been helped. 

In helping soup, fish, or any other dish, remember that to overfill a 
plate is as bad as to supply it too scantily. 

Silver fish-knives will now always be met with at the best tables ; but 
where there are none, a piece of crust should be taken in the left hand, 
and the fork in the right. There is no exception to this rule in eating 

fish. 

We presume it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader that he is 
never, under any circumstances, to convey his knife to his mouth. Peas 
are eaten with the fork ; tarts, curry, and puddings of all kinds with the 

spoon. 

Always help fish with a fish-slice, and tart and puddings with a spoon, 
or, if necessary, a spoon and fork. 

Asparagus must be helped with the asparagus-tongs. 

In eating asparagus, it is well to observe what others do, and act accord- 
ino-ly. Some very well-bred people eat it with the fingers ; others cut off 
the heads, and convey them to the mouth upon the fork. It would be 
difficult to say which is the more correct. 

In eating stone fruit, such as cherries, damsons, etc., the same rule had 
better be observed. Some put the stones out from the mouth into a spoon, 
and so convey them to the plate. Others cover the lips with the hand, 
drop them unseen into the palm, and so deposit them on the side of the 
plate. In our own opinion, the latter is the better way, as it effectually 
conceals the return of the stones, which is certainly the point of highest 
importance. Of one thing we may be sure, and that is, that they must 
never be dropped from the mouth to the plate. 

In helping sauce, always pour it on the side of the plate. 
It' the servants do not go round with the wine (which is by far the best 
custom), the gentlemen at a dinner table should take upon themselves the 
office of helping those ladies who sit near them. Ladies take more wine 



THE DINNER TABLE. 



271 



in the present day than they did fifty years ago, and gentlemen should 
remember this, and offer it frequently. Ladies cannot very well ask for 
wine, but they can always decline it. At all events the}' do not like to be 
neglected, or to see gentlemen liberally helping themselves, without ob- 
serving whether their fair neighbour's glasses are full or empty. 

The habit of taking wine with each other has almost wholly gone out 
of fashion. A gentleman may ask the lady whom he conducted down to 
dinner, or he may ask the lady of the house to take wine with him. But 
even these last remnants of the old custom are fast falling into disuse. 

Unless you are a total abstainer, it is extremely uncivil to decline tak- 
ing wine if you are invited to do so. In accepting, you have only to pour 
a little fresh wine into your glass, look at the person who invited you, 
bow slightly, and take a sip from the glass. 

It is particularly ill-bred to empty your glass on these occasions. 

Certain wines are taken with certain dishes, by old-established cus- 
tom as sherry or sauterne, with soup and fish ; hock and claret, with 
roast meat ; punch with turtle ; champagne with sweet-bread and cut- 
lets ; port with venison ; port or burgundy, with game ; sparklin^ wines 
between the roast and the confectionery ; madeira with sweets ; port with 
cheese ; and for dessert, port, tokay, madeira, sherry and claret. Red 
wines should never be iced, even in summer. Claret and burgundy should 
always be slightly warmed ; claret-cup and champagne cup should, of 
course, be iced. 

Instead of cooling their wines in the ice pail, some hosts introduce clear 
ice upon the table, broken up in small lumps, to be put inside the glasses. 
This cannot be too strongly reprehended. Melting ice can but weaken the 
quality and flavour of the wine. Those who desire to drink wine and 
water, can ask for iced water if they choose, but it savours too much of 
economy on the part of the host to insinuate the ice inside the glasses of 
his guests when the wine could be more effectually iced outside the bottle. 

A silver knife and fork should be placed to each guest at dessert. 

If you are asked to prepare fruit for a lady, be careful to do so by means 
of the silver knife and fork only, and never to touch it with your fingers. 

It is wise never to partake of any dish without knowing of what in- 
gredients it is composed. You can always ask the servant who hands it 
to you, and you thereby avoid all danger of having to commit the impolite- 
ness of leaving it, and showing that you do not approve of it. 

Never speak while you have anything in your mouth. 

Be careful never to taste soups or puddings till you are sure they are 
sufficiently cool ; as, by disregarding this caution, you may be compelled 



272 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

to swallow what is dangerously hot, or be driven to the unpardonable al- 
ternative of returning it to your plate. 

When eating or drinking, avoid every kind of audible testimony to the 

fact. 

Finger-glasses, containing water slightly warmed and perfumed, are 
placed to each person at dessert. In these you may dip the tips of your 
fingers, wiping them afterwards on your table-napkin. If the finger-glass 
and doyley are placed on your dessert-plate, you should immediately re- 
move the doyley to the left of your plate, and place the finger-glass upon 
it. By these means you leave the right for the wine-glasses. 

Be careful to know the shapes of the various kinds of wine-glasses com- 
monly in use, in order that you may never put forward one for another. 
High and narrow, and very broad and shallow glasses, are used for cham- 
pagne ; large, goblet-shaped glasses for burgundy and claret ; ordinary 
wine-glasses for sherry and madeira ; green glasses for hock ; and some- 
what large, bell-shaped glasses for port. 

Port, sherry, and madeira are decanted. Hock and champagnes appear 
in their native bottles. Claret and burgundy are handed around in a 

claret jug. 

Coffee and liqueurs should be handed round when the dessert has been 
about a quarter of an hour on the table. After this, the ladies generally 

retire. 

Should no servant be present to do so, the gentleman who is nearest the 
door should hold it for the ladies to pass through. 

When the ladies are leaving the dining-room, the gentlemen all rise in 
their places, and do not resume their seats till the last lady is gone. 

If you should unfortunately overturn or break anything, do not apolo- 
gize for it. You can show your regret in your face, but it is not well-bred 

to put it into words. 

Should you injure a lady's dress, apologize amply, and assist her, if pos- 
sible, to remove all traces of the damage. 

To abstain from taking the last piece on the dish, or the last glass of 
wine in the decanter, only because it is the last, is highly ill-bred. It im- 
plies a fear that the vacancy cannot be supplied, and almost conveys an 
affront to your host. 

In summing up the little duties and laws of the table, a popular author 
has said that "The chief matter of consideration at the dinner-table as, 
indeed, everywhere else in the life of a gentleman is to be perfectly com- 
posed and at his ease. He speaks deliberately ; he performs the most im- 
portant act of the day as if he were performing the most ordinary. Yet 



PARTY AND BAL1XROOM KTIQUETTE. 273 

there is no appearar.ee of trifling or want of gravity in his manner, he 
maintains the dignity which is so becoming on so vital an occasion. He 
performs all the ceremonies, yet in the style of one who performs no cere- 
monies at all. He goes through all the complicated duties of the scene as 
If he were ' to the manner born.' " 

To the giver of a dinner we have but one or two remarks to offer. If 
he be a bachelor, he had better give his dinner at a good hotel. If a mar- 
ried man, he will, we presume, enter into council with his wife and his 
cook. In any case, however, he should always bear in mind that it is his 
duty to entertain his friends in the best inanner that his means permit ; 
and that this is the least he can do to recompense them for the expendi- 
ture of time and money which they incur in accepting his invitation. 

In conclusion, we may observe that to sit long in the dining-room after 
the ladies have retired is to pay a bad compliment to the hostess and her 
fair visitors ; and that it is still worse to rejoin them with a flushed face 
and impaired powers of thought. A refined gentleman is always tem- 
perate.

HOW TO ORGANIZE A DANCING 
PARTY OR BALL. 

S the number of guests at a dinner-party is regulated by 
the size of the table, so should the number of invitations 
to a ball be limited by the proportions of the dancing or 
ball-room. A prudent hostess will always invite a few 
more guests than she really desires to entertain, in the 
certainty that there will be some deserters when the ap- 
pointed evening comes round ; but she will at the same 
time remember that to overcrowd her room is to spoil the 
pleasure of those who love dancing, and that a party of 
this kind when too numerously attended is as great a failure as one at 
which too few are present. 

A room which is nearly square, yet a little longer than it is broad, will 
be found the most favourable for a ball. It admits of two quadrille par- 
R 




274, THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ties or two round dances, at the same time. In a perfectly square room 
this arrangement is not so practicable or pleasant. A very long and nar- 
row room and their number in this country is legion, is obviously of the 
worst shape for the purpose of dancing, and is fit only for quadrilles and 

country dances. 

The top of the ball-room is the part nearest the musicians. In a pn 
room the top is where it would be if the room were a dining-room. It is 
generally at the farthest point from the door. Dancers should be careful 
to ascertain the top of the room before taking their places, as the top 
couples always lead the dances. 

A good floor is of the first importance in a ball-room. In a private 
house, nothing can be better than a smooth, well-stretched holland, with 

the carpet beneath. 

Abundance of light and free ventilation are indispensable to the spu 

and comfort of the dancers. 

Good music is as necessary to the prosperity of a ball as good wine 
the excellence of a dinner. No hostess should tax her friends for this part 
of the entertainment. It is the most injurious economy imaginable, 
dies who would prefer to dance are tied to the pianoforte ; and as few 
amateurs have been trained in the art of playing dance music, with that 
strict attention to time and accent which is absolutely necessary to the 
comfort of the dancers, a total and general discontent is sure to be the re- 
sult To play dance music thoroughly well is a branch of the art which 
requires considerable practice. It is as different from every other kind of 
playing as whale fishing is from fly fishing. Those who give-private ball* 
will do well ever to bear this in mind, and to provide skilled musicians fc 
the evenin^ For a small party, a piano and cornopean make a very plea- 
sant combination. Unless where several instruments are engaged we 
not recommend the introduction of the violin ; although in some respect 
the finest of all solo instruments, it is apt to sound thin and shrill whi 
employed on mere inexpressive dance tunes, and played by a mer 

player. 

Invitations to a ball or dance should be issued in the name of the 
of the house and written on small note-paper of the best quality, 
printed forms, some of them printed in gold or silver, are to be had at every 
stationer's by those who prefer them. The paper may be gilt-edged, b 
not coloured. 

An invitation to a ball should be sent out at least ten days befc 
evening appointed, A fortnight, three weeks, and even a month may 1 
allowed in the way of notice. 



HOW TO ORGAXI/K A HAXOIXG PARTY OR T.AI.L. -275 

Not more than two or three days should be permitted to elapse before 
you reply to an invitation of this kind. The reply should always lie ad- 
dressed to the lady of the house, and should be couched in the same per- 
son as the invitation. The following are the forms generally in use : 

Mrs. Molyneux requests the honour of Captain Hamilton's company at an evening 
party, on Monday, March the ILth instant. 

Dititi-liHj ir',11 /,/; ,,f Xl tie o'clock. 

Thursday, March 1st. 

Captain Hamilton has much pleasure in accepting Mrs. Molyneux's polite invitation 
f jr Monday evening, March the llth instant. 

Friday, March 2nd. 

The old form of " presenting compliments " is now out of fashion. 

If Mrs. Molyneux writes to Captain Hamilton in the first person, as 
" My dear Sir," he is bound in etiquette to reply " My dear Madam." 

The lady who gives a ball* should endeavour to secure an equal num- 
ber of dancers of both sexes. Many private parties are spoiled by the 
preponderance of young ladies, some of whom never get partners at all, 
unless they dance with each other. 

A room should in all cases be provided for the accommodation of the 
ladies. In this room there ought to be several looking-glasses ; attendants 
to assist the fair visitors in the arrangement of their hair and dress ; and 
some place in which the cloaks and shawls can be laid in order, and found 
at a moment's notice. It is well to affix tickets to the cloaks, giving a 
duplicate at the same time to each lady, as at the public theatres and con- 
cert rooms. Needles and thread should also be at hand, to repair any little 
accident incurred in dancing. 

Another room should be devoted to refreshments, and kept amply sup- 
plied with coffee, lemonade, ices, wine, and biscuits during the evening. 
Where this cannot be arranged, the refreshments should be handed round 
between the dances. 

The question of supper is one which so entirely depends on the means 
of those who give a ball or evening party, that very little can be said upon 
it in a treatise of this description. Where mone}' is no object, it is of 
course always preferable to have the whole supper, "with all appliances 
and means to boot," sent in from some first-rate house. It spares all trou- 
ble whether to the entertainers or their servants, and relieves the hostess 

* It will be understood that we use the word " ball'' to signify a private parly where there is 
dancing, as well as a public ball. 



276 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

of every anxiety. Where circumstances render such a course imprudent, 
we would only observe that a home-provided supper, however simple, 
should be good of its kind, and abundant in quantity. Dancers are gene- 
rally hungry people, and feel themselves much aggrieved if the supply of 
sandwiches proves unequal to the demand. 

BALL-EOOM TIOLETTE. 

LADIES. 

The style of a lady's dress is a matter so entirely dependent on age, 
means, and fashion, that we can offer but little advice upon it. Fashion is 
so variable, that statements which are true of it to-day may be false a 
month hence. Respecting no institution of modern society is it so difficult 
to pronounce half-a-dozen permanent rules. 

We may perhaps be permitted to suggest the following leading princi- 
ples ; but we do so with diffidence. Rich colours harmonize with rich 
brunette complexions and dark hair. Delicate colours are the most suitable 
for delicate and fragile styles of beauty. Very young ladies are never so 
suitably attired as in white. Ladies who dance should wear dresses of 
light and diaphanous materials, such as tulle gauze, crape, net, etc., over 
coloured silk slips. Silk dresses are not suitable for dancing. A married 
lady who dances only a few quadrilles may wear a decolletee silk dress with 

propi'iety. 

Very stout persons should never wear white. It has the effect of adding 

to the bulk of the figure. 

Black and scarlet or black and violet, are worn in mourning. 

A lady in deep mourning should not dance at all. 

However fashionable it may be to wear very long dresses, those ladies 
who go to a ball with the intention of dancing and enjoying the dance, 
should cause their dresses to be made short enough to clear the ground. 
We would ask them whether it is not better to accept this slight deviation 
from an absurd fashion, than to appear for three parts of the evening in a 
torn and pinned-up skirt. 

Well-made shoes, whatever their colour or material, and faultless gloves, 
are indispensable to the effect of a ball-room toilette. 

Much jewellery is out of place in a ball-room. Beautiful flowers, whe- 
ther natural or artificial, are the loveliest ornaments that a lady can wear 
on these occasions. 



ETIQUETTE OF THE BALL-ROOM. 77 

GENTLEMEN. 



A black suit, thin enameled boots, a white neckcloth, and white or deli- 
cate gray gloves, are the chief points of a gentleman's ball-room toilette. 
He may wear a plain-bosomed shirt with one stud. White waistcoats are 
now fashionable. Much display of jewellery is no proof of good taste. A 
handsome watch-chain with, perhaps, the addition of a few costly trifles 
suspended to it, and a single shirt-stud, are the only adornments of this 
kind that gentleman should wear. 

A gentleman's dress is necessarily so simple that it admits of no compro- 
mise in point of quality and style. The material should be the best that 
mone} T can procure, and the fashion unexceptionable. So much on the out- 
ward man depends on his tailor, that we would urge no gentleman to 
economize in this matter. 

ETIQUETTE OF THE BALL-ROOM. 

On entering the ball-room, the visitor should at once seek the lady of the 
house, and pay his respects to her. Having done this, he may exchange 
salutations with such friends and acquaintances as may be in the room. 

If the ball be a public one, and a gentleman desires to dance with any 
lady to whom he is a stranger, he must apply to a member of the floor 
committee for an introduction. 

Even in private balls, no gentleman can invite a lady to dance without 
a previous introduction. This introduction should be effected through the 
lady of the house or a member of her family. 

No lady should accept an invitation to dance from a gentleman to whom 
she has not been introduced. In case any gentleman should commit the 
error of so inviting her, she should not excuse herself on the plea of a pre- 
vious engagement or of fatigue, as to do so would imply that she did not 
herself attach due importance to the necessary ceremony of inti-oduction. 
Her best reply would be to the effect that she would have much pleasure 
in accepting his invitation if he would procure an introduction to her. 
This observation may be taken as applying only to public balls. At a 
private party the host and hostess are sufficient guarantees for the respect- 
ability of their guests; and although a gentleman would show a singular 
want of knowledge of the laws of society in acting as we have supposed, 
the lady who should reply to him as if he were merely an impertinent 
stranger in a public assembly-room, would be implying an affront to her 
entertainers. The mere fact of being assembled together under the roof of 



278 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

a mutual friend, is in itself, a kind of general introduction of the guests to 

each other. 

An introduction given for the mere purpose of enabling a lady and gen- 
tleman to go through a dance together, does not constitute an acquaint- 
anceship. The lady is at liberty, should she feel like doing so, to pass the 
gentleman the next day without recognition. 

' To attempt to dance without a knowledge of dancing is not only to 
make one's self ridiculous, but one's partner also. No lady or gentleman 
has a right to place a partner in this absurd position. 

Never forget a ball-room engagement. To do so is to commit an unpar- 
donable offence against good breeding. 

It is not necessary that a lady or gentleman should be acquainted with 
the steps in order to walk gracefully and easily through a quadrille. An 
easy carriage and a knowledge of the figure is all that is requisite. A round 
dance, however, should on no account be attempted without a thorough 
knowledge of the steps and some previous practice. 

No person who has not a good ear for time and tune need hope to dance 

well. 

At the conclusion of a dance the gentleman bows to his partner, an( 
either promenades with her round the room or takes her to a seat. Where 
a room is set apart for refreshments, he offers to conduct her thither. At 
a public ball no gentleman would, of course, permit a lady to pay for 
refreshments. Good taste forbids that a lady and gentleman should dance 
too frequently together, at either a public 6* private ball. Engaged per- 
sons should be careful not to commit this conspicuous solecism. 

If a lady happens to forget a previous engagement, and stands up with 
another partner, the gentleman whom she has thus slighted is bound to 
believe that she has acted from mere inadvertence, and should by no means 
suffer his pride to master his good temper. To cause a disagreeable scene 
in a private ball-room is to affront your host and hostess, and to make 
yourself absurd. In a public room it is no less reprehensive. 

Always remember that good breeding and good temper (or the appear- 
ance of good temper) are inseparably connected. 

Young gentlemen are earnestly advised not to limit their conversation 
to remarks on the weather and the heat of the room. It is to a certain 
extent incumbent on them to do something more than dance when they 
invite a lady to join a quadrille. If it be only upon the news of the day, 
a gentleman should be able to afford at least three or four observations < 
his partner in the course of a long half hour. 



THE QUADRILLE. 279 

Gentlemen who dance cannot be too careful not to injure the dresses of 
the ladies who do them the honour to stand up with them. The young 
men of the present day are singularly careless in this respect, and when 
they have torn a lady's delicate skirt, appear to think the mischief they 
have done scarcely worth the trouble of an apology. 

A gentleman conducts his last partner to the supper-room, and having 
waited upon her while there, re-conducts her to the ball-room. 

Never attempt to take a place in a dance which has been previously 
engaged. 

A thoughtful hostess will never introduce a bad dancer to a good one, 
because she has no right to punish one friend in order to oblige another. 

It is not customary for married persons to dance together in society. 

THE QUADKILLE. 

The Quadrille is the most universal, as it is certainly the most sociable 
of all fashionable dances. It admits of pleasant conversation, frequent 
interchange of partners, and is adapted to every age, the young or old ; the 
ponderous paterfamilias or his sylph-like daughter, may with equal pro- 
priety take part in its easy and elegant figures. Even an occasional 
blunder is of less consequence in this dance than in many others, for each 
personage is in some degree free as to his own movements, not being com- 
pelled by the continual embrace of his partner to dance either better or 
worse than he may find convenient. 

People now generally walk through a quadrille. Nothing more than a 
perfect knowledge of the figure, a graceful demeanour, and a correct ear 
for the time of the music are requisite to enable any one to take a credit- 
able part in this dance. 

As soon as a gentleman has engaged his partner for the quadrille, he 
should endeavour to secure as his vis-a-vis some friend or acquaintance, 
and should then lead his partner to the top of the quadrille, provided that 
post of honour be still vacant. He will place the lady always at his right 
hand. 

Quadrille music is divided into eight bars, for each part of the figure ; 
two steps should be taken in every bar ; every movement thus invariably 
consists of eight or four steps. 

It is well not to learn too many new figures ; the memory is liable to 
become confused among them ; besides which, it is doubtful whether your 
partner, or vour ri.s-a- {<*, is as learned in the matter as yourself. Masters 
are extremely fond of inventing and teaching new figures ; but you will 



280 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

do well to confine your attention to a few simple and universally received 
sets, which you will find quite sufficient for your purpose. We begin with 
the oldest and most common, the 

FIEST SET OF QUADRILLES. 

FIRST FIGURE. LE PANTALON. 

The couples at the top and bottom of the quadrille cross to each other's 
places in eight steps, occupying four bars of the time ; re-cross immediately 
to their own places, which completes the movement of eight bars. This is 
called the Chaine Anglaise. The gentleman always keeps to the right of 
vis-a-vis's lady in crossing, thus placing her inside. 

Set to partners, or balancez; turn your partner. (This occupies the se- 
cond eight bars.) Ladies' chain, or chaine des dames. (Eight bars more.) 
Each couple crosses to opposite couple's place, gentleman giving his hand 
to his partner ; this is called half-promenade. Couples re-cross right and 
left to their places, without giving hands, which completes another eight 
bars and ends the figure. 

The side couples repeat what the top and bottom couples have done. 



SECOND FIGURE. LE TE. 



The ladies in all the top couples, and their vis-a-vis gentlemen, ad- 
vance four steps, and retire the same, repeating this movement once 
aain, which makes the first eight bars. 

Top ladies and vis-a-vis gentlemen cross to ea?h other's places; ad- 
vance four steps ; retreat ditto ; cross back towards partners, who set to 
them as they advance ; turn partners, which ends the first half of figure. 

Second ladies and top vis-a-vis gentlemen execute the same movements. 
The side couples begin, the privilege of commencement being conferred on 
those ladies who stand at the right of the top couples. 

This figure is sometimes performed in a different manner known as. 
double LEU. Instead of the top lady and vis-a-via gentlemen advancing 
alone, they advance with partners, joining hands ; cross and return, as in 
the single figure. This 'variation is, however, somewhat out of vogue, 
except (as will presently be seen) in the last figure of the quadrille, where 
it is still frequently introduced. 

THIRD FIGURE. LA POULE. 

Top lady and vis-a-vis gentleman cross to each other's places, giving 
right hand in passing; cross back again with left hand (eight bars). The

two couples form in a line, and join hands, the left hand of the one hold- 
ing the right hand of his or her neighbour, so that each faces different 
ways ; in this position all four balancez, then half promenade with partner 
to opposite place : top lady and vis-a-vis gentleman advance four steps- 
and retire ditto. (2nd eight bars.) Both top and bottom couples advance 
together, and retire the same ; then re-cross right and left to places. (3rd 
eight bars.) Second lady and first opposing gentleman repeat figure. 
Side couples repeat, observing same rule for commencement as in L'EU. 

FOURTH FIGURE. LA TUENISE. 

Top couples join hands, advance four steps and retreat ditto; advance 
again, gentleman leaving lady at left hand of vis-a-vis gentleman and re- 
tiring alone. (1st eight bars.) Two ladies advance, crossing to opposite 
side ; gentleman advances to meet his partner, vis-a-vis lady returns to 
hers. (2nd eight bars). Balancez ; turns partners to places. (3rd eight 
bars.) Second couple performs same figure ; side couples repeat as before 

If La Pastorale be preferred, it will be performed thus : Top couples 
advance and retreat ; advance, gentleman leading lady to left hand of 
vis-a-vis gentleman ; he advances with both ladies four steps, retreating 
ditto; again advancing he leaves both ladies with first gentleman, retreat- 
ing alone ; top gentleman and both ladies advance and retreat ; again ad- 
vance, joining hands in circle, go half round, half promenade to opposite 
places, then return right and left to their own. Second couples and side- 
couples repeat as before. 

FIFTH FIGURE. LA FINALE. 

Begin with the grand rond or great round ; that is, the whole quad- 
rille ; first and second couples and sides join hands all around, advance 
four steps, and retreat ditto. L'EU is now sometimes introduced, the 
grand rond being repeated between each division of the figure. But it 
gives a greater variety and brio to the quadrille if, after the first grand 
rond, the following figure is performed, the galop step being used through- 
out. Each gentleman (at top and bottom couples) takes his lady round 
the waist, as for the galop; advance four steps, retreat ditto, advance 
again, cross to opposite places ; advance, retreat, re-cross to own places. 
Ladies' chain; half promenade across ; half right and left to places ; grand 
rond. Side couples repeat figure. Grand rond between each division 
and at the conclusion. Bow to your partners, and conduct your lady to- 
seat.

THE LANCERS. 

The Lancers Quadrille is perhaps the most graceful and animated of 
any. Within the last few years it has become a great favourite in fash- 
ionable circles. It admits of much skill and elegance in executing its 
quick and varied figures, a correct acquaintance with which is absolutely 
requisite to all who take part in it. Unlike the common quadrille, the 
Lancers must be danced by four couples only in each set ; though of course 
there can be many sets dancing at the same time. The number being so 
limited, one awkward or ignorant person confuses the whole set ; there- 
fore, it is indispensable that every one who dances in this quadrille should 
have a thorough mastery of its graceful intricacies. We have observed 
that of late it has become the fashion to substitute new tunes and new 
figures for the old well-known music of the Lancers Quadrille. We cannot 
consider this an improvement. The old simple melodies are peculiarly 
fitted to the sprightly, joyous character of the dance; which is more than 
can be said for any of the modern substitutes. When these are used, the 
Lancers, in our opinion, loses its individuality and spirit, becoming almost 
like a common quadrille. We should be heartily glad to see the old tunes 
restored, once for all, to their rightful supremacy. 

The sets of four couples, top, opposite, and sides, having been arranged, 
the dance begins as follows : 

1st Figure. First lady and opposite gentleman advance and retreat ; 
advance again, joining their hands ; pass round each other and back to 
places. (1st eight bars.) Top .couple join hands, and cross, opposite 
couple crossing at the same time, separately, outside them ; the same re- 
versed, back to places. (2nd eight bars.) All the couples balancez to 
corners ; each gentleman turns his neighbour's partner back to places. 
(3rd eight bars.) Second couple repeat figure from beginning ; after them 
side couples, those who stand to the right of top couple having always 
the priority, as in the common quadrille. 

2nd Fiyure. First couple advance and retreat, gentleman holding 
lady's left hand ; advance again ; gentleman leaves his partner in the 
centre of the quadrille, and retires to place. (1st eight bars.) Balances 
to each other and turn to places. (2nd eight bars). Side couples join 
first and second couples, forming a line of four on either side. Each line 
advances four steps, retreats ditto ; then advances again, each gentleman 
reclaiming his partner, and all turn to places. Second and side couples 
repeat figure in succession. 



THE LAXCKKS. 283 

Srd Figure. First lady advances four steps alone, and stops ; via-a-vis 
gentleman does the same ; first lady retires, facing gentleman, to whom 
she makes a slow profound courtesy. (The courtesy must occupy a bar or 
two of the music ; and as, if made with grace and dignity, it is most ef- 
fective, we would recommend ladies to practise it carefully beforehand.) 
The ^entleman at the same time bows and retires (1st eight bars). All 
four ladies advance to centre, give right hands across to each other (which 
is called the double chain), and left hand to PM-CMM gentleman; then 
back again, left hand across in the middle, and right hands to partners 
back to places. (2nd eight bars.) Second and side couples repeat figure 
from commencement. 

A more recent fashion for dancing this figure is as follows : Instead of 
one lady advancing at first, all four advance, and courtesy to each other ; 
then turn and courtesy to their partners. Ladies do the moulinet in the 
centre ; that is, give right hands across to each other, and half round ; 
left hands across back again and return to places. Gentlemen meantime 
.all move round outside the ladies, till each has regained his place. Figure 
.as usual repeated four times; but the second and fourth time the gentle- 
men advance instead of the ladies, and bow, first to each other, then to 
their partners; continuing as before through the rest of the figure. 

4th Figure. Top gentleman, taking partner's left hand, leads her to 
'the couple on their right, to whom they bow and courtesy (which civility 
must be met with the like acknowledgment), then cross quickly to fourth 
couple, and do the same. (1st eight bars.) All four couples chassez croisez 
right and left (gentlemen invariably passing behind his partner), then 
(turn hands (tour des mains') back to places. (2nd eight bars.) First and 
opposite couples right and left across and back again to place (3rd eight 
bars.) Second and sides repeat as usual. 

5th Figure. This figure commences with the music. Each couple 
should stand ready, the gentleman facing his partner, his right hand hold- 
.inghers. If every one does not start directly the music begins, and does 
mot observe strict time throughout, the somewhat intricate figure becomes 
hopelessly embarrassed; but, when well danced, it is the prettiest of the 
set. It commences with the grande chaine all round ; each gentleman 
giving his right hand to his partner at starting, his left to the next lady, 
then his right again, and so all round, till all have returned to their places. 
(This occupies sixteen bars of the music.) First couple promenade inside 
figure, returning to places with their backs turned to opposite couple. The 
side couple on their right falls in immediately behind them ; the fourth 
couple follows, the second couple remaining intheir places. A double line 



284 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

is thus formed ladies on one side and gentlemen on the other. (3rd eight 
bars.,) All chassez croisez, ladies left, gentlemen right, behind partners. 
First lady leads off, turning sharply round to the right ; first gentleman 
does the same to the left, meeting at the bottom of the quadrille, and pro- 
menade back to places. All the ladies follow first lady ; all the gentlemen 
follow first gentleman; and as each meets his partner at the bottom of the 
figure, they touch hands, then fall back in two lines ladies on one side, 
gentlemen on the other facing each other. (4th eight bars.) Four ladies 
join hands, advance, and retreat; four gentlemen ditto at the same time; 
then each turns his partner to places. (5th eight bars.) Orande chaine 
again. Second and side couples repeat the whole figure in succession, each 
couple taking its turn to lead off, as the first had done. Grande chaine 
between each figure and in conclusion. 

THE LANCERS FOR SIXTEEN, OR DOUBLE LANCERS. 

1st Figure. Two first ladies and vis-a-vis gentlemen begin at the same 
moment, and go through the figure as in Single Lancers. All balances to 
corners ; in other words, each lady sets to gentleman at her right, who 
turns her to her place. Second couples and sides repeat as usual. 

2nd Figure. First couples advance, retreat, advance again, leaving 
ladies in centre ; set to partners and turn to places. Two side couples 
nearest first couples join them; two side couples nearest second couples 
do the same, thus forming eight in each line. They all advance and re- 
treat, holding hands, then turn partners to places. Repeated by second 
and side couples as usual. 

3rd Figure. First ladies advance and stop ; vis-a-vis gentlemen ditto ; 
courtesy profoundly, bow, and back to places. Ladies do the moulinet, 
gentlemen go round outside, and back to places. Or, ladies advance and 
courtesy to each other and then to partners ; gentle men doing the same 
when the second and fourth couples begin the figure, as in Single Lancers. 

4-th Figure. First couples advance to couples on their right ; bow and 
courtesy ; cross to opposite side, bow and courtesy, chassez croisez, and re- 
turn to place. Right and left to opposite place, and back again. Second 
couples and sides repeat figure. 

5th Figure. Orande chaine all round, pausing at the end of every eight 
bars to bow and courtesy ; continue chaine back to places, which will 
occupy altogether thirty-two bars of the music. Figure almost the same 
as in Single Lancers. Both first couples lead around, side couples falling 
in behind, thus forming four sets of lines. Figure repeated by second 



DOUBLE QUADRILLE. 85 

and side couples; grande chalne between each "figure and at the con- 
clusion. 

DOUBLE QUADEILLE. 

This quadrille contains the same figures as the common quadrille, but 
so arranged that they are danced by four instead of two couples. All quad- 
rille music suits it ; and it occupies just half the time of the old quadrille. 
It makes an agreeable variety in the movements of the dance, and is 
easily learned. It requires four couples. 

FIRST FIGURE. PANTALON. 

First and second couples right and left, whilst side couples dance the 
chaine Anglaise outside them. All four couples set to partners and turn 
them. Four ladies form ladies' chain, or hands across in the middle of 
the figure, giving first right hands, and then left, back to places. Half 
promenade, first and second couples do ckaine Anglaise, while side cou- 
ples do grande chaine round them. This leaves all in their right places, 
and ends figure. 

SECOND FIGURE. L'ETE. 

First lady, and lady on her right hand, perform the figure with their 
vis-a-vis gentlemen, as in common L'Ete' ; taking care, when they cross, to 
make a semi-circle to the left. Second couple and second side couple 
repeat figure, as in common L'Ete. 

THIRD FIGURE. LA POULE. 

Top lady and vis-a-vis gentleman, lady at her right and her opposite 
gentleman, perform figure at the same time, setting to each other in two 
cross lines. Other couples follow as usual. 

FOURTH FIGURE. LA PASTORALE. 

The first and opposite couples dance the figure, not with each other, 
but with the couples to their right. The latter do the same with first 
and second couples. 

FIFTH FIGURE. FINALE. 

Galopade all round. Top and opposite galopade forwards, and retreat. 
As they retreat side couples advance ; and as they retreat in their turn, 
first and second couples galopade to each others places. Side couples the 
same. First and second couples advance again ; side couples the same as 
the others retreat ; first and second back to places as side couples retreat. 



286 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Side couples back to places. Double cludne des dames, and galopade all 
round. Then side couples repeat figure as usual, and galop all round in 
conclusion. 

It is requisite to keep correct time and step in this quadrille, which 
would otherwise become much confused. 

THE POLKA. 

The origin of this once celebrated dance is difficult to ascertain. It is 
believed by some to be of great antiquity, and to have been brought into 
Germany from the East. Others affirm that its origin is of more recent 
date, and its birthplace considerably nearer home. An authority on these 
matters remarks : " In spite of what those professors say who proclaim 
to have learned the Polka in Germany, or as being indebted for it to an 
Hungarian nobleman, we are far from placing confidence in their asser- 
tions. In our opinion, Paris is its birthplace, and its true author, un- 
doubtedly, the now far-famed Monsieur Cellarius, for whom this offspring 
of his genius has gained a European celebrity." 

Whatever we may be inclined to believe with regard to this disputed 
question, there can be no doubt of the widespread popularity which for 
many years was enjoyed by the Polka. When first introduced in 1843, it 
was received with enthusiasm ; and it effected a complete revolution in 
the style of dancing which had prevailed up to that period. A brisk, 
lively character was imparted even to the steady -going quadrille ; the old 
Valse a, Trois Temps was pronounced insufferably "slow"; and its bril- 
liant rival, the Valse a Deux Temps, which had been recently introduced, 
at once established the supremacy which it has ever since maintained. 
The galop, which had been until this period only an occasional dance, 
now assumed a prominent post in every ball-room, dividing the honours 
with the valse. 

Perhaps no dance affords greater facilities for the display of ignorance 
or skill, elegance or vulgarity, than the Polka. The step is simple and 
easily acquired, but the method of dancing it varies ad infinitum. Some 
persons race and romp through the dance in a manner fatiguing to them- 
selves and dangerous to their fellow-dancers. Others (though this is more 
rare) drag their partner listlessly along, with a sovereign contempt alike 
for the requirements of the time and the spirit of the music. Some gen- 
tlemen hold their partner so tight that she is half-suffocated; others 
hold her so loosely that she continually slips away from them. All these 
extremes are equally objectionable, and defeat the graceful intention of 
the dance. It should be performed quietly, but with spirit, and always 



THE POLKA. 287 

in virict time. The head and shoulders should be kept still, not jerked 
ami turned at every step, as is the manner of some. The feet should 
glide swiftly along the floor not hopping or jumping as if the board- 
were red hot. 

You should clasp your partner lightly but firmly round the waist with 
your right arm. 

Your left hand takes her right hand ; but beware of elevating your 
arm and hers in the air, or holding them out straight, which suggests the 
idea of windmills. 

Above all, never place your hand on your hip or behind you. In the 
first place, you thus drag your partner too much forward, which makes 
her look ungraceful ; in the next, this attitude is never used except in 
casinos, and it is almost an insult to introduce it in a respectable ball- 
room. 9 

Let the hand which clasps your partner's fall easily by your side in a 
natural position, and keep it there. Your partner's left hand rests on 
your right shoulder ; her right arm is thrown a little forwards towards 
your left. 

The Polka is danced in \ time. There are three steps in each bar ; the 
fourth beat is always a rest. 

It is next to impossible to describe in words the step of the Polka, or 
of any circular dance : nothing but example can correctly teach it ; and 
although we shall do our best to be as clear as possible, we would ear- 
nestly recommend those of our readers who desire to excel whether in 
this or the following dances, to take a few lessons from some competent 
instructor. 

The gentleman starts with his left foot, the lady with her right. We 
shall describe the step as danced by the gentleman ; the same directions, 
reversing the order of the feet, will apply to the lady. 

1st beat. Spring lightly on right foot, at the same time slide left foot 
forward. 

2d beat. Bring right foot forward by glissade, at the same time raising 
left foot. 

3d beat. Bring left foot slightly forward and fall upon it, leaving right 
foot raised, and the knee slightly bent, ready to begin the step at the first 
beat of the next bar. 

4tth beat. Remain on left foot. Begin next bar with the right foot, 
and repeat the step to the end of third beat. Begin the following bar 
with left foot, and so on ; commencing each bar with right or left foot 
alternately. 



288 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The Polka is danced with a circular movement, like the Valse ; in each 
loar you half turn, so that by the end of the second bar, you have brought 
your partner completely round. 

The circular movement of the Polka admits of two directions from 
right to left or from left to right. The ordinary direction is from right 
to left. The opposite one is known as the reverse step. It is more diffi- 
cult to execute, but is a pleasant change for skilled dancers, if they have 
become giddy from turning too long in one direction. 

In dancing the Polka, or any circular dance where a large number of 
couples are performing at the same time, the gentleman must be careful 
to steer his fair burden safely through the mazes of the crowded ball- 
room. A little watchfulness can almost always avoid collisions, and a 
o-ood dancer would consider himself disgraced if any mishap occurred to 
a lady under his care. Keep a sharp Ipokout, and avoid crowded corners. 
Should so many couples be dancing as to render such caution impossible, 
stop at once and do not go on until the room has become somewhat 
cleared. In a few minutes others will have paused to rest, and you can 
then continue. Your partner will be grateful that your consideration has 
preserved her from the dismal plight in which we have seen some ladies 
emerge from this dance their coiffures disordered, their dresses torn, and 
their cheeks crimson with fatigue and mortification, while their indignant 
glances plainly showed the anger they did not care to express in words, 
and which their reckless partner had fully deserved. A torn dress is 
sometimes not the heaviest penalty incurred : we have known more than 
one instance where ladies have been lamed for weeks through the culp- 
able carelessness of their partners ; their tender feet having been half 
crushed beneath some heavy boot in one of these awkward collisions. 
This is a severe price to pay for an evening's amusement, and gentlemen 
are bound to be cautious how they inflict it or anything approaching to 
it, upon their fair companions. Ladies, on the other hand, will do well to 
remember that by leaning heavily upon their partner's shoulder, dragging 
back from his encircling arm, or otherwise impeding the freedom of his 
movements, they materially add to his labour and take from his pleasure 
in the dance. They should endeavour to lean as lightly, and give as little 
trouble as possible ; for, however flattering to the vanity of the nobler 
sex may be the idea of feminine dependence, we question whether the 
reality, in the shape of a dead weight upon their aching arms throughout 
a Polka or a Valse of twenty minutes' duration, would be acceptable even 
to the most chivalrous among them. 



THE POLKA. 289 

We have been thus minute in our instructions, because they not only 
apply to the Polka, but equally to all circular dances where a great number 
stand up to dance at the same time. We nn\v pass on to the Mazurka. 

The time of the Mazurka is f , like the common val.su ; but it should 
be played much more slowly ; if danced quickly, it becomes an unmean- 
ing succession of hops, and its graceful character is destroyed. 

We describe the step as danced by the lady; for gentlemen it will be 
the >ame, with the feet reversed ; that is, for right foot read left, and 
so on. 

FIRST STEP. 

1st and 2nd beats. Spring on left foot, sliding forward right foot at the 
same time, and immediately let your weight rest on the forward foot. 
This occupies two beats. 

3rd beat. Spring on right foot ; this ends the bar. 

2nd bar, 1st and 2nd beats. Spring again on right foot, and slide for- 
ward left at same time. Rest on it a moment as before during second 
beat ; at third beat spring on it ; which ends second liar. Continue same 
step throughout. You will perceive that, at the first and third beats of 
the time you hop slightly, resting, during the second beats, on the fore- 
most foot. 

SECOND STEP. 

1st beat. Spring on left foot, slightly striking both heels together. 

2nd beat. Slide right foot to the right, bending the knee. 

3rd beat. Bring the left foot up to the right foot with a slight spring, 
raising right foot ; which ends the first bar. 

2nd bar, 1st beat. Spring again on left foot, striking it with heel of 
right. 

2nd beat. Slide right foot to the right. 

3rd beat. Fall on right foot, raising left foot behind it, which ends the 
second bar. Reverse the step by springing first on the right foot, and 
sliding the left, etc. The music generally indicates that this step should 
be repeated three times to the right, which occupies three bars then rest 
during the fourth bar, and return with reverse step to the left during the 
three bars which follow, resting again at the eighth bar. 

THIRD STEP. 

1st bent. Spring on left foot, and slide right foot to the right. 

2nd beat. Rest on right foot. 

3rd beat. Spring on right foot, bringing left foot up behind it. 

s

! bar, 1st beat Spring on right foot, sliding left foot to the left. 
2nd beat. Rest on left foot. 
3rd beat.-H.op on left foot, bringing right behind as before. Continue 

at pleasure. 

The first of these three steps is most commonly used in the valse ; but 
the second is an agreeable change for those who may have grown giddy 
or weary in doing the figure en tournant (circular movement). 

Be careful not to exaggerate the slight hop at the first and third beats 
of each bar ; and to slide the foot gracefully forward, not merely to make 
a step, as some bad dancers do. 

THE MAZUKKA QUADRILLE. 

This elegant quadrille has five figures, and can be performed by any 
even number of couples. The music, like the step, is that of the Mazurka. 
The couples are arranged as in the ordinary quadrille. 

Join hands all round ; grand rond to the left (four bars), then back 
again to the right (four bars), employing the second step of the Mazurka. 
Each couple does the petit tour forwards and backwards, still using the 
second step, and repeating it three times to the right then resting a bar ; 
three times to the left, then resting another bar ; which occupies eight 
bars of the music. These figures may be considered as preliminary. 

Is* Figure. Top and bottom couples right and left (eight bars), with 
Kedowa step ; then they advance, the ladies cross over, the gentlemen 
meanwhile pass quickly round each other, and return to own places (four 
bars) ; petit tour forward with opposite ladies (four bars) ; right and left 
(eight bars) ; advance again ; the ladies return to own places, and the 
gentlemen pass again round each other to their own ladies (four bars) ; 
petit tour backward (four bars). Side couples do likewise. 

2nd Figure. (Eight bars rest.) Top and bottom couples advance and 
retire, hands joined (four bars). All cross over into opposite places, each 
going to each other's left (four bars); petit tour forward (four bars); 
advance and retire (four bars), and return to places (four bars). Petit 
tour (four bars). Side couples do likewise. 

3rd Figure. (Eight bars rest). Top and bottom ladies cross over into- 
opposite places (four bars) ; return, presenting left hand to each other, and 
right hand to partner, as in La Poule (four bars) ; pass round with part- 
ners into opposite places (four bars) ; petit tour backward (four bars) ; 
vis-d-vis couples hands across, round (six bars) ; retire (two bars) ; top 
and bottom ladies cross over (four bars) ; ladies cross again, giving each 



THE VALSE A DEUX TEMPS. 

other left hands, and right to partners (four bars). All pass round to own 
places (four bars) ; petit tour backward (four bars 1 . 

Ml* Figure. (Eight bars rest.) Top couple lead round inside the figure 
(eight bars) ; petit tour forward and backward (eight bars) ; advance to 
opposite couple ; the gentleman turns half round without quitting his 
partner, and gives his left hand to opposite lady ; the two ladies join 
hands behind gentleman (four bars) ; in this position the three advance 
and retire (eight bars). The gentleman passes under the ladies' arms; all 
three pass round to the left, with second step of Mazurka, the opposite 
lady finishing in her own place (four bars). The top couple return to 
places (four bars) ; petit tour forward (four bars). Opposite couple and 
side couples do likewise. 

5th Figure. (Eight bars rest.) Top and bottom couples half right and 
left (four bars) ; petit tour backward (four bars) ; half right and left to 
places (four bars); petit tour backward (four bars); vi*-d-i-is couples 
hands round to opposite places (four bars) ; pd'd tour forward (four bars) ; 
hands round to own places (four bars) ; petit tour (four bars) ; right and 
left (eight bars). 

Side couples do likewise. 

F iff lie. Grand round all to the left, and then to the right (sixteen 
Lars) ; grand chain, as in the Lancers, with first step of Mazurka (sixteen 
bars). But if there are more than eight in the quadrille, the music must 
be continued until all have regained their places. 

N.B. Music continues during rests. 

THE VALSE A DEUX TEMPS. 

We are indebted to the mirth-loving capital of Austria for this brilliant 
Valse. 

This Valse is incorrect in time. Two steps can never properly be made 
to occupy the space of three beats in the music. The ear requires that 
each beat shall have its step. This inaccuracy in the measure has exposed 
the Vt.<>> (/ Deux Temps to the just censure of musicians, but has never 
interfered with its success among dancers. We must caution our readers, 
however, against one mistake often made by the inexperienced. They 
imagine that it is unnecessary to observe any rule of time in this dance, 
and are perfectly careless whether they begin the step at the beginning^ 
end, or middle of the bar. This is quite inadmissible. Every bar must 
contain within its three beats two steps. These steps must begin and 
end strictly with the beginning and end of each bar ; otherwise a hopeless 



292 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

confusion of the measure will ensue. Precision in this matter is the more 
requisite, because of the peculiarity in the measure. If the first step in 
each bar be not strongly marked, the valse measure has no chance of 
making itself apparent ; and the dance becomes a meaningless galop. 

The "step contains two movements, a glissade and a cliassez, following 
each other quickly in the same direction. Gentleman begins as usual 
with his left foot ; lady with her right. 

1st beat. Glissade to the left with left foot. 

2nd and 3rd beats. Cliassez in the same direction with right foot ; do 
inot turn in this first bar. 

2nd bar, 1st beat. Slide right foot backwards, turning half round. 

2nd and 3rd beats. Pass left foot behind right, and Chossez forward 
with it, turning half round to complete the figure en tournant. Finish 
with right foot in front, and begin over again with left foot. 

There is no variation in this step ; but you can vary the movement by 
going backward or forward at pleasure, instead of continuing the rotary 
motion. The Valse a Deux Temps, like the Polka, admits of a reverse 
step ; but it looks awkward unless executed to perfection. The first re- 
quisite in this Valse is to avoid all jumping movements. The feet must 
glide smoothly and swiftly over the floor, and be raised from it as little as 
possible. Being so very quick a dance, it must be performed quietly, 
otherwi.se it is liable to become ungraceful and vulgar. The steps should 
be short, and the knees slightly bent. 

As the movement is necessarily very rapid, the danger of collision is 
proportionately increased; and gentlemen will do well to remember and 

act upon this hint. 

They should also be scrupulous not to attempt to conduct a lady through 
this valse until they have thoroughly mastered the step and well practised 
the figure en tournant. Awkwardness or inexperience doubles the risk 
of a collision ; which, in this extremely rapid dance, might be attended 
-with serious consequences. 

The Deux Temps is a somewhat fatiguing valse, and after two or three 
turns around the room, the gentleman should pause to allow his partner to 
rest. He should be careful to select a lady whose height does not present 
too striking a contrast to his own ; for it looks ridiculous to see a tall 
man dancing with a short woman and vice versa. This observation ap- 
plies to all round dances, but especially to the valse, in any of its forms. 



SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY AND A VIRGINNY REEL. 293 

THE GALOP. 

The Galop, as its name implies, is the quintescence of all the " fast " 
dances. At the time of the Polka mania it was very much in vogue, and 
almost as great a favourite as the Deux Temps. Although its popularity 
has greatly declined of late, it generally occurs twice or thrice in the pro- 
gramme of every ball-room ; and the music of the Galop is, like the dance 
itself, so gay and spirited, that we should regret to see it wholly laid 
aside. The step is similar to that of the Deiuc Temps Valse, but the time 
is |, and as quick as possible. Two ckassez steps are made in each bar. 
The figure can be varied by taking four or eight steps in the same 
direction, or by turning with every two steps, as in the Deux Temps. 
Like all round dances, it admits of an unlimited number of couples. 
Being, perhaps, the most easy of any, every one takes part in it, and the 
room is generally crowded during its continuance. A special amount of 
care is therefore necessary on the part of the gentleman to protect his 
partner from accidents. 

SIE EOGEE DE COVEELEY AND A VIEGOTY EEEL. 

Sir Roger de Coverley or the Virginny Reel is always introduced at 
the end of the evening, and no dance could be so well fitted to send the 
guests home in good humour with each other and with their hosts. We 
describe it as it is danced in the present day, slightly modernized to suit 
the taste of our present time. Like the quadrille, it can be danced with 
equal propriety by old or young, and is so easy that the most inexper- 
ienced dancer may fearlessly venture to take part in it. 

Form in two parallel lines ; ladies on the left, gentlemen on the right, 
facing their partners. All advance ; retreat (which occupies the first four 
bars) ; cross to opposite places (four bars more) ; advance and retreat (four 
bars) ; recross to places (four bars). 

The lady who stands at the top and the gentleman who stands at the 
bottom, of each line, advance towards each other, courtesy and bow, and 
retire to places. The gentleman at the top and the lady at the bottom 
do the same. Top lady advances, gives right hand to partner opposite, 
and passes behind the two gentlemen standing next to him. Then 
through the line and across it, giving left hand to partner, who meets her 
half way between the two lines, having in the meantime passed behind 
the two ladies who stood next his partner. Lady then passes behind the 
two ladies next lowest ; gentleman at same time behind the two gentle- 
men next lowest ; and so on all down the line. At the bottom lady gives

left hand to her partner, and they promenade back to place at the top of 
the line. (This figure is frequently omitted.) Top couple advance, cour- 
tesy and bow, then lady turns off to the right, gentlemen to the left, each 
followed by the rest of her or his line. Top couple meet at the bottom of 
figure, join hands, and raising their arms, let all the other couples pass 
under them towards the top of the line, till all reach their own places, 
except the top, who have now become the bottom couple. Figure is re-

would be out of place in these pages to grapple with a sub- 
ject so large as that of Love in its various phases : a theme 
that must be left to poets, novelists, and moralists to dilate 
upon. It is sufficient for our purpose to recognise the 
existence of this, the most universal the most powerful 
of human passions, when venturing to offer our counsel and 
guidance to those of both sexes who, under its promptings, 
have resolved to become votaries of Hymen, but who, from 
imperfect knowledge of conventional usages, are naturally 
apprehensive that at every step they take they may render themselves 
liable to misconception, ridicule, or censure. 

We will take it for granted, then, that a gentleman has in one way or 
another become fascinated by a fair lady possibly a recent acquaintance 
whom he is most anxious to know more particularly. His heart already 
feels " the inly touch of love," and his most ardent wish is to have that 
love returned. 

At this point we venture to give him a word of serious advice. We 
urge him, before he ventures to take any step towards the pursuit of this 
object, to consider well his position and prospects in life, and reflect 
whether they are such as to justify him in deliberately seeking to win 



FIRST STEPS IN COURTSHIP. 295 

the young lady's affections, with the view of making her his wife at no 
distant period. Should he, after such a review of his affairs, feel satisfied 
that he can proceed hononrably, he may then use fair opportunities to 
ascertain the estimation in which the young lady, as well as her family, is 
held by friends. It is perhaps needless to add, that all possible delicacy 
and caution must be observed in making such enquiries, so as to avoid 
compromising the lady herself in the slightest degree. When he has 
satisfied himself on this head, and found no insurmountable impediment 
in his way, his next endeavour will be, through the mediation of a com- 
mon friend, to procure an introduction to the lady's family. Those who 
undertake such an office incur no slight responsibility, and are, of course, 
expected to be scrupulously careful in performing it, and to communicate 
all they happen to know affecting the character and circumstances of the 
individual they introduce. 

We will now reverse the picture, and see how matters stand on the 
fair one's side. 

First, let us hope that the inclination is mutual ; at all events that the 
lady views her admirer with preference, that she deems him not unworthy 
of her favourable regard, and that his attentions are agreeable to her. 
It is true her heart may not yet be won : she has to be wooed ; and what 
fair daughter of Eve has not hailed with rapture that brightest day in 
the springtide of her life ? She has probably first met the gentleman at 
a ball, or other festive occasion, where the excitement of the scene has 
reflected on every object around a roseate tint. We are to suppose, of 
course, that in looks, manners, and address, her incipient admirer is not 
below her ideal standard in gentlemanly attributes. His respectful ap- 
proaches to her in soliciting her hand as a partner in the dance, etc.- 
have first awakened on her part a slight feeling of interest towards him- 
This mutual feeling of interest, once established, soon " grows by what it 
feeds on." The exaltation of the whole scene favours its development, 
and it can hardly be wondered at if both parties leave judgment " out in 
the cold " while enjoying each other's society, and possibly already pleas- 
antly occupied in building " castles in the air." Whatever may eventu- 
ally come of it, the fair one is conscious for the nonce of being unusually 
happy. This emotion is not likely to be diminished when she finds her- 
self the object of general attention accompanied, it may be, by the dis- 
play of a little envy among rival beauties owing to the assiduous homage 
of her admirer. At length, prudence whispers that he is to her, as yet, a 
comparative stranger ; and with a modest reserve she endeavours to retire 
from his observation, so as not to seem to encourage his attentions. The 



296 TnE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

gentleman's ardour, however, is not to be thus checked ; he again solicits 
her to be his partner in a dance. She finds it hard, very hard, to refuse 
him ; and both, yielding at last to the alluring influences by which they 
are surrounded, discover at the moment of parting that a new and de- 
lightful sensation has been awakened in their hearts. 

At a juncture so critical in the life of a young, inexperienced woman as 
that when she begins to form an attachment for one of the opposite sex 
at a moment when she needs the very best advice, accompanied with a 
considerable regard for her overwrought feelings the very best course 
she can take is to confide the secret of her heart to that truest and most 
loving of friends her mother. Fortunate is the daughter who has not 
been deprived of that wisest and tenderest of counsellors whose experi- 
ence of life, whose prudence and sagacity, whose anxious care and appre- 
ciation of her child's sentiments, and whose awakened recollections of her 
own trysting days, qualify and entitle her, above all other beings, to coun- 
sel and comfort her trusting child, and to claim her confidence. Let the 
timid girl then pour forth into her mother's ear the flood of her pent-up 
feelings. Let her endeavour to distrust her own judgment, and seek hope, 
guidance, and support from one who, she well knows, will not deceive or 
mislead her. The confidence thus established will be productive of the 
most beneficial results by securing the daughter's obedience to her 
parent's advice, and her willing adoption of the observances prescribed by 
etiquette, which, as the courtship progresses, that parent will not fail to 
recommend as strictly essential in this phase of life. Where a young 
woman has had the misfortune to be deprived of her mother, she should 
at such a period endeavour to find her next best counsellor in some female 
relative, or other trustworthy friend. 

We are to suppose that favourable opportunities for meeting have oc- 
curred, until, by and by, both the lady and her admirer have come to 
regard each other with such warm feelings of inclination as to have a 
constant craving for each other's society. Other eyes have in the mean- 
time not failed to notice the symptoms of a growing attachment ; and 
some " kind friends " have, no doubt, even set them down as already 
engaged. 

The admirer of the fair one is, indeed, so much enamoured as to be un- 
able longer to retain his secret within his own breast ; and not being 
without hope that his attachment is reciprocated, resolves on seeking an 
introduction to the lady's family preparatory to his making a formal de- 
claration of love. 






WHAT THE LADY SHOULD OBSERVE DURING COURTSHIP. 297 

It is possible, however, that the lover's endeavours to procure the de- 
sired introduction may fail of success, although where no material differ- 
ence of social position exists, this difficulty will be found to occur less 
frequently than might at first be supposed. He must then discreetly 
adopt measures to bring himself, in some degree, under the fair one's- 
notice : such, for instance, as attending the place of worship which she 
frequents, meeting her, so often as to be manifestly for the purpose , in the 
course of her promenades, etc. He will thus soon be able to judge even 
without speaking to the lady whether his further attentions will be 
distasteful to her. The signs of this on the lady's part, though of the 
most trifling nature, and in no way compromising her, will be unmistak- 
able ; for, as the poet tells us in speaking of the sex : 

" He gave them but one tongue to say us ' Nay," 
And two fond eyes to grant ! " 

Should her demeanour be decidedly discouraging, any perseverance on 
his part would be ungentlemanly and highly indecorous. But, on the 
other hand, should a timid blush intimate doubt, or a gentle smile lurk- 
ing in the half-dropped eye give pleasing challenge to further parley, when 
possible he may venture to write not to the lady that would be the 
opening of a clandestine correspondence ; an unworthy course, where 
every act should be open and straightforward, as tending to manly and 
honourable ends but to the father or guardian, through the agency of a 
common friend where feasible, or, in some instances, to the party at whose 
residence the lady may be staying. In his letter he ought first to state 
his position in life and prospects, as well as mention his family connec- 
tions ; and then request permission to visit the family, as a preliminay 
step to paying his addresses to the object of his admiration. 

By this course he in no wise compromises either himself or the lady, 
but leaves open to both, at any future period, an opportunity of retiring 
from the position of courtship taken up on the one side, and of receiving 
addresses on the other, without laying either party open to the accusation 
of fickleness or jilting. 

What the Lady should observe during Courtship. 

A lady should be particular during the early days of courtship while 
still retaining some clearness of mental vision to observe the manner in, 
which her suitor comports himself to other ladies. If he behave with 
ease and courtesy, without freedom or the slightest approach to license in 
manner or conversation ; if he never speak slightingly of the sex, and 



298 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

is ever ready to honour its virtues and defend its weakness ; she may 
continue to incline towards him a willing ear. His habits and his con- 
duct must awaken her vigilant attention before it be too late. Should 
he come to visit her at irregular hours ; should he exhibit a vague or 
wandering attention give proofs of a want of punctuality show disre- 
spect for age sneer at things sacred, or absent himself from regular at- 
tendance at divine service or evince an inclination to expensive pleas- 
ures beyond his means, or to low and vulgar amusements ; should he be 
foppish, eccentric, or very slovenly in his dress ; or display a frivolity of 
mind, and an absence of well-directed energy in his worldly pursuits ; let 
the young lady, we say, while there is yet time, eschew that gentleman's 
acquaintance, and allow it gently to drop. The effort, at whatever cost 
to her feelings, must be made, if she have any regard for her future hap- 
piness and self-respect. The proper course then to take is to intimate her 
distaste, and the causes that have given rise to it, to her parents or guar- 
dian, who will be pretty sure to sympathize with her, and to take mea- 
sures for facilitating the retirement of the gentleman from his pretensions. 

What the Gentleman should observe during Courtship. 

It would be well also for the suitor, on his part, during the first few 
weeks of courtship, carefully to observe the conduct of the young lady 
in her own family, and the degree of estimation in which she is held by 
them, as well as among her intimate friends. If she be attentive to her 
duties ; respectful and affectionate to her parents ; kind and forbearing 
to her brothers and sisters ; not easily ruffled in temper ; if her mind be 
prone to cheerfulness and to hopeful aspiration, instead of to the display 
of a morbid anxiety and dread of coming evil ; if her pleasures and en- 
joyments be those which chiefly centre in home ; if her words be charac- 
terized by benevolence, goodwill, and charity : then we say, let him not 
hesitate, but hasten to enshrine so precious a gem in the casket of Ins 
affections. But if, on the other hand, he should find that he has been 
attracted by the tricksome affectation and heartless allurements of a flirt, 
ready to bestow smiles on all, but with a heart for none ; if she who has 
succeeded for a time in fascinating him be of uneven temper, easily pro- 
voked, and slow to be appeased ; fond of showy dress, and eager for ad- 
miration ; ecstatic about trifles, frivolous in her tastes, and weak and 
wavering in performing her duties ; if her religious observances are mere- 
ly the formality of lip-service ; if she be petulant to her friends, pert and 
disrespectful to her parents, overbearing to her inferiors ;,if pride, vanity, 



PRESENTS THE PROPOSAL. 2<)9 

and affectation be her characteristics ; if she be inconstant in her friend- 
ships ; gaudy and slovenly, rather than neat and scrupulously clean, in 
attire and personal habits ; then we counsel the gentleman to retire as 
speedily, but as politely, as possible from the pursuit of an object un- 
worthy >f his admiration and love ; nor dread that the lady's friends 
who must know her better than he can do will call him to account for 
withdrawing from the field. 

But we will take it for granted that all goes on well ; that the parties 
are, on sufficient acquaintance, pleased with each other, and the gentle- 
man is eager to prove the sincerity of his affectionate regard by giving 
some substantial token of his love and homage to the fair one. This 
brings us to the question of 

Presents, 

a point on which certain observances of etiquette must not be disregard- 
ed. A lady, for instance, cannot with propriety accept presents from a 
gentleman previovdy to his having made proposals of marriage. She 
would by so doing incur an obligation at once embarrassing and unbe- 
coming. Should, however, the gentleman insist on making her a present 
as some trifling object of jewellery, etc. there must be no secret about 
it. Let the young lady take an early opportunity of saying to her ad- 
mirer, in the presence of her father or mother, " I am much obliged to 
you fop that ring (or other trinket, as the case may be) which you kindly 
offered me the other day, and which I shall be most happy to accept, if 
my parents do not object ; " and let her say this in a manner which, 
while it increases the obligation, will divest it altogether of impropriety, 
from having been conferred under the sanction of her parents. 

We have now reached that stage in the, progress of the Courtship, 
where budding affection, having developed into mature growth, encour- 
ages the lover to make 

The Proposal. 

When about to take this step, the suitor's first difficulty is how to get 
a favourable opportunity ; and next, having got the chance, how to screw 
his courage up to give utterance to the " declaration." A declaration in 
writing should certainly be avoided where the lover can by any possibil- 
ity get at the lady's ear. But there are cases where this is so difficult 
that an impatient lover cannot be restrained from adopting the agency of 
a biflet-douj; in declaring his passion. 



300 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The lady, before proposal, is generally prepared for it. It is seldom 
that such an avowal comes without some previous indications of look and 
manner on the part of the admirer, which can hardly fail of being under- 
stood. She may not, indeed, consider herself engaged ; and although 
nearly certain of the conquest she has made, may yet have her misgivings. 
Some gentlemen dread to ask, lest they should be refused. Many pause 
just at the point, and refrain from anything like ardour in their profes- 
sions of attachment, until they feel confident that they may be spared 
the mortification and ridicule that is supposed to attach to being rejected, 
in addition to the pain of disappointed hope. This hesitation when the 
mind is made up is wrong ; but it does often occur, and we suppose ever 
will do so, with persons of great timidity of character. By it both parties 
are kept needlessly on the fret, until the long-looked-for opportunity un- 
expectedly arrives, when the flood-gates of feeling are loosened, and the 
full tide of mutual affection gushes forth uncontrolled. It is, however, 
at this moment the agony-point to the embarrassed lover, who " doats 
yet doubts "whose suppressed feelings rendered him morbidly sensitive 

that a lady should be especially careful lest any show of either prudery 

or coquetry on her part should lose to her forever the object of her choice. 
True love is generally delicate and timid, and may easily be scared by 
affected indifference, through feelings of wounded pride. A lover needs 
very little to assure him of the reciprocation of his attachment : a glance, 
a single pressure of the hand, a whispered syllable, on the part of the 
loved one, will suffice to confirm his hopes. 

Eefusal by the Young Lady. 

When a lady rejects the proposal of a gentleman, her behaviour should 
be characterized by the most delicate feeling toward one who, in offering 
her his hand, has proved his desire to confer upon her, by this implied 
preference for her above all other women, the greatest honour it is in his 
power to offer. Therefore, if she have no love for him, she ought at 
least to evince a tender regard for his feelings ; and in the event of her 
being previously engaged, should at once acquaint him with the fact. No 
right-minded man would desire to persist in a suit, when he well knew 
that the object of his admiration had already disposed of her heart. 

When a gentleman makes an offer of his hand by letter, the letter must 

be answered, and certainly not returned, should the answer be a refusal ; 

unless, indeed, when from a previous repulse, or some other particular and 

special circumstance, such an offer may be regarded by the lady or her 



CONDUCT OF A GKXTLEMAX WHKX ADDRESSES REJECTED. 3Q1 

relatives as presumptuous and intrusive. Under such circumstances, the 
letter may be placed by the lady in the hands of her parents or guardian, 
to be dealt with by them as they may deem most advisable. 

No woman of proper feeling would regard her rejection of an offer of 
marriage from a worthy man as a matter of triumph ; her feeling on such 
an occasion should be one of regretful sympathy with him for the pain 
she is unavoidably compelled to inflict. Nor should such a rejection be 
unaccompanied with some degree of self-examination on her part, to 
discern whether any lightness of demeanour or tendency to flirtation may 
have given rise to a false hope of her favouring his suit. At all events, 
no lady should ever treat the man who has so honoured her with the 
slightest disrespect or frivolous disregard, nor ever unfeelingly parade a 
more favoured suitor before one whom she has refused. 

Conduct of a Gentleman when his Addresses are Eejected. 

The conduct of the gentleman under such distressing circumstances 
should be characterized by extreme delicacy and a chivalrous resolve to 
avoid occasioning any possible annoyance or uneasiness to the fair author 
of his pain. If, however, he should have reason to suppose that his rejec- 
tion has resulted from mere indifference to his suit, he need not altogether 
retire from the field, but may endeavour to kindle a feeling of regard and 
sympathy for the pateint endurance of his disappointment, and for his 
continued but respectful endeavours to please the lukewarm fair one. 
But in case of avowed or evident preference for another, it becomes im- 
perative upon him, as a gentleman, to withdraw at once, and so relieve 
the lady of any obstacle, that his presence or pretensions may occasion, to 
the furtherance of her obvious wishes. A pertinacious continuance of his 
attentions, on the part of one who has been distinctly rejected, is an in- 
sult deserving of the severest reprobation. Although the weakness of 
her sex, which ought to be her protection, frequently prevents a woman 
from forcibly breaking off an acquaintance thus annoyingly forced upon 
her, she rarely fails to resent such impertinence by that sharpest of 
woman's weapons, a keen-edged but courteous ridicule, which few men 
can bear up against. 

Kefusal by the Lady's Parents or Guardians. 

It may happen that both the lady and her suitor are willing, but that 
the parents or guardians of the former, on being referred to, deem the 
connection unfitting, and refuse their consent. In this state of matters, 



302 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

the first thing a man of sense, proper feeling, and candour should do, is to 
endeavour to learn the objections of the parents, to see whether they can- 
not be removed. If they are based upon his present insufficiency of 
means, a lover of a persevering spirit may effect much in removing appre- 
hension on that score, by cheerfully submitting to a reasonable time of 
probation, in the hope of amelioration in his worldly circumstances. 
Happiness delayed will be none the less precious when love has stood the 
test of constancy and the trial of time. Should the objection be founded 
on inequality of social position, the parties, if young, may wait until 
matured age shall ripen their judgment and place the future more at their 
own disposal. A clandestine marriage should be peremptorily declined. 
In too many cases it is a fraud committed by an elder and more experi- 
enced party upon one whose ignorance of the world's ways, and whose 
confiding tenderness appeal to him for protection even against himself. 
In nearly all the instances we have known of such marriages, the result 
proved the step to have been ill-judged, imprudent, and highly injurious 
to the reputation of one party, and in the long run detrimental to the 
happiness of both. 

Conduct of the Engaged Couple. 

The conduct of the bridegroom-elect should be marked by a gallant and 
affectionate assiduity towards his lady-love a denouement easily felt 
and understood, but not so easy to define. That of the lady towards him 
should manifest delicacy, tenderness, and confidence : while looking for 
his thorough devotion to herself, she should not captiously take offence 
and show airs at his showing the same kind of attention to other ladies 
as she, in her turn, would not hesitate to receive from the other sex. 

In the behaviour of a gentleman towards his betrothed in public, little 
difference should be perceptible from his demeanour to other ladies, except 
in those minute attentions which none but those who love can properly 
understand or appreciate. 

In private, the slightest approach to indecorous familiarity must be 
avoided ; indeed it is pretty certain to be resented by every woman who 
deserves to be a bride. The lady's honour is now in her lover's hands, 
and he should never forget in his demeanour to and before her that that 
lady is to be his future wife. 

It is the privilege of the betrothed lover, as it is also his duty, to give 
advice to the fair one who now implicitly confides in him. Should he 
detect a fault, should he observe failings which he would wish removed 



CONDUCT OF THE LADY DURING HER BETROTHAL. 393 

or amended, let him avail himself of this season, so favourable foi 
the frank interchange of thought between the betrothed pair, to urgetli>-i: 
correction. He will find a ready listener ; and any judicious counsel 
offered to her by him will now be gratefully received, and remembered in 
after life. After marriage it may be too late ; for advice on trivial points 
of conduct may then not improbably be resented by the wife as an un- 
necessary interference ; now, the fair and loving creature is disposed like 
pliant wax in his hands to mould herself to his reasonable wishes in all 
things. 

Conduct of the Lady during her Betrothal 

A lady is not expected to keep aloof from society on her engagement, 
nor to debar herself from the customary attentions and courtesies of her 
male acquaintances generally ; but she should, while accepting them 
cheerfully, maintain such a prudent reserve, as to intimate that they are 
viewed by her as mere acts of ordinary courtesy and friendship. In all 
places of public amusement at balls, the opera, etc, for a lady to be 
seen with any other cavalier than her avowed lover, in close attendance 
upon her, would expose her to the imputation of flirtation. She will 
naturally take pains at such a period to observe the taste of her lover in 
regard to her costume, and strive carefully to follow it, for all men desire 
to have their taste and wishes on such apparent trifles gratified. She 
should at the same time observe much delicacy in regard to dress, and be 
careful to avoid any unseemly display of her charms ; lovers are naturally 
jealous of observation under such circumstances. It is a mistake not sel- 
dom made by women, to suppose their suitors will be pleased by the glow- 
ing admiration expressed by other men for the object of their passion. 
Most lovers, on the contrary, we believe, would prefer to withdraw their 
prize from general observation until the happy moment for their union 
has arrived. 

Conduct of the Gentleman towards the Family of his Betrothed. 

The lover, having now secured his position, should use discretion and 
tact in his intercourse with the lady's family, and take care that his visits 
be not deemed too frequent so as to be really inconvenient to them. He 
should accommodate himself as much as possible to their habits and ways, 
and be ever ready and attentive to consult their wishes. Marked atten- 
tion, and in most cases affectionate kindness, to the lady's mother ought to 
be shown ; such respectable homage will secure for him many advantages 



304 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

in his present position. He must not, however, presume to take his stand 
yet as a member of the family, nor exhibit an obtrusive familiarity in 
manner and conversation. Should a disruption of the engagement from 
some unexpected cause ensue, it is obvious that any such premature as- 
sumption would lead to very embarrassing results. In short, his conduct 
should be such as to win for himself the esteem and affection of all the 
family, and dispose them ever to welcome and desire his presence, rather 
than regard him as an intruder. 

Conduct of the Lady on Eetiring from her Engagement. 

Should this step unhappily be found necessary on the lady's part, the 
truth should be spoken, and the reasons frankly given ; there must be no 
room left for the suspicion of its having originated in caprice or injus- 
tice. The case should be so put that the gentleman himself must see and 
acknowledge the justice of the painful decision arrived at. Incompatible 
habits, ungentlemanly actions, anything tending to diminish that respect 
for the lover which should be felt for the husband ; inconstancy, ill- 
governed temper all of which, not to mention other obvious objections 
are to be considered as sufficient reasons for terminating an engagement. 
The communication should be made as tenderly as possible; room maybe 
left in mere venial cases for reformation ; but all that is done must be so 
managed that not the slightest shadow of fickleness or want of faith may 
rest upon the character of the lady. It must be remembered, however, 
that the termination of an engagement by a lady has the privilege of pass- 
ing unchallenged ; a lady not being bound to declare any other reason 
than her will. Nevertheless she owes it to her own reputation that her 
decision should rest on a sufficient foundation, and be unmistakably pro- 
nounced. 

Conduct of the Gentleman on Eetiring from his Engagement. 

We hardly know how to approach this portion of our subject. The 
reasons must be strong indeed that can sufficiently justify a man, placed 
in the position of an accepted suitor, in severing the ties by which he has 
bound himself to a lady with the avowed intention of making her his 
wife. His reasons for breaking off his engagement must be such as will 
not merely satisfy his own conscience, but will justify him in the eyes of 
the world. If the fault be on the lady's side, great reserve and delicacy 
will be observed by any man of honour. If, on the other hand, the imper- 
ative force of circumstances, such as loss of fortune, or some other unex- 




. 



DEMEANOUR OF Till-: SUITOR DURING COURTSHIP. 395 

red calamity to himself, may be the cause, then must the reason be 
clearly and fully explained, in such a manner as to soothe the painful 
feeling which such a result must necessarily occasion to the lady and her 
friends. It is scarcely necessary to point out the necessity for observing 
great caution in all that relates to the antecedents of an engagement that 
has been broken off; especially the return on either side of presents and 
of all letters that have passed. 

This last allusion brings us to the consideration of 

Correspondence. 

Letter-writing is one great test of ability and cultivation, as respects 
both sexes. The imperfection of education may be to some extent con- 
cealed or glossed over in conversation, but cannot fail to stand out con- 
spicuously in a letter. An ill-written letter infallibly betrays the vulgar- 
ity and ignorance indicative of a mean social position. 

But there is something more to be guarded against than even bad writ- 
ing and worse spelling in a correspondence : saying too much writing 
that kind of matter which will not bear to be read by other eyes than 
those for which it was originally intended. That this is too frequently 
done is amply proved by the love letters often read in a court of law, the 
most affecting passages from which occasion " roars of laughter " and the 
derisive comments of merry-making counsel. Occurrences of this kind 
prove how frequently letters are not returned or burned when an affair of 
the heart is broken off. Correspondence between lovers should at all 
events be tempered with discretion ; and on the lady's part particularly, 
her affectionate expressions should not degenerate into a silly style of 
fondness. 

It is as well to remark here, that in correspondence between a couple 
not actually engaged, the use of Christian names in addressing each other 
should be avoided. 

Demeanour of the Suitor during Courtship. 

The manners of a gentleman are ever characterized by urbanity and a 
becoming consideration for the feelings and wishes of others, and by a 
readiness to practise self-denial. But the very nature of courtship re- 
quires the fullest exercise of these excellent qualities on his part. The 
lover should carefully accommodate his tone and bearing, whether cheer- 
ful or serious, to the mood for the time of his lady-love, whose slightest 
wish must be his law. In his assiduities to her he must allow of no stint 
T 



306 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

though hindered by time, distance, or fatigue, he must strive to make his 
professional and social duties bend to his homage at the shrine of love. 
All this can be done, moreover, by a man of excellent sense with perfect 
propriety. Indeed, the world will not only commend him for such devoted 
gallantry, but will be pretty sure to censure him for any short-coming in 
his performance of such devoirs. 

It is, perhaps, needless to observe that at such a period a gentleman 
should be scrupulously neat, without appearing particular, in his attire. 
We shall not attempt to prescribe what he should wear, as that must, of 
course, depend on the times of the day when his visits are paid, and other 
circumstances, such as meeting a party of friends, going to the theatre, etc., 
with the lady. 

Should the Courtship be Short or Long ? 

The answer to this question must depend on the previous acquaintance- 
ship, connection, or relation of the parties, as well as on their present c' 
cum'stances, and the position of their parents. In case of relationship 
old acquaintanceship subsisting between the families, when the courtship, 
declaration, and engagement have followed each other rapidly, a short 
wooins is preferable to a long one, should other circumstances not create 
an obstacle. Indeed, as a general rule, we are disposed strongly to recom- 
mend a short courtship. A man is never well settled in the saddle of his 
fortunes until he be married. He wants spring, purpose, and aim ; and, 
above all, he wants a home as the centre of his efforts. Some portion of 
inconvenience, therefore, may be risked to obtain this ; in fact, it often 
occurs that by waiting too long the freshness of life is worn off, and that 
the generous glow of early feelings becomes tamed down to lukewarm- 
ness, by a too prudent delaying ; while a slight sacrifice of ambition or 
self-indulgence on the part of the gentleman, and a little descent from 
pride of station on the lady's side, might have insured years of satisfied 
love and happy wedded life. 

On the other hand, we would recommend a long courtship as advisable 
w hen the friends on both sides favouring the match it happens that 
the fortune of neither party will prudently allow an immediate marriage. 
The gentleman, we will suppose, has his way to make in his profession or 
business, and is desirous not to involve the object of his affection in the 
distressing inconvenience, if not the misery, of straightened means. He 
reflects that for a lady it is an actual degradation, however love may en- 
noble the motive of her submission, to descend from her former footing in 



PRELIMINARY ETIQUETTE OF A WEDDING. 307 

society. He feels, therefore, that this risk ought not to be incurred. For, 
although the noble and loving spirit of a wife might enable her to bear 
up cheerfully against misfortune, and by her endearments soothe the 
broken spirit of her husband ; yet the lover who would wilfully, at the 
outset of wedded life, expose his devoted helpmate to the ordeal of pov- 
erty, would be deservedly scouted as selfish and unworthy. These, then 
are among the circumstances which warrant a lengthened engagement, and 
it should be the endeavour of the lady's friends to approve such cautious 
delay, and do all they can to- assist the lover in his efforts to abridge it. 
The lady's father should regard the lover in the light of another son 
added to the family, and spare no pains to promote his interests in life 
while the lady's mother should do everything in her power, by those 
small attentions which a mother understands so well, to make the pro- 
tracted engagement agreeable to him, and as endurable as possible to her 
daughter. 

Preliminary Etiquette of a Wedding. 

Whether the term of courtship may hava been long or short accord- 
ing to the requirements of the case the time will at last arrive for 

Fixing the Day. 

While it is the gentleman's province to press for the earliest possible 
opportunity, it is the lady's privilege to name the happy day ; not but 
that the bridegroom-elect must, after all, issue the fiat, for he has' much to 
consider and prepare for beforehand : for instance, to settle where it will 
be most convenient to spend the honeymoon a point which must depend 
on the season of the year, on his own vocation, and other circumstances. 
At this advanced state of affairs, we must not overlook the important 
question of 

The Bridal Trousseau and the Wedding Presents. 

Wedding presents must be sent always to the bride, never to the bride- 
groom, though they be given by the friends of the latter. They should 
be sent during the week previous to the wedding day, as it is customary 
to display them before the ceremony. 

Two cards folded in the invitation in the envelope are sent with the 
wedding invitation. The invitation is in the name of the bride's mother, 
or, if she is not living, the relative or friend nearest the bride :

The two cards, one large and one small, are folded in this invitation. 
Upon the large card is engraved :

On the smaller one:

If the voun- people "receive" after their return from the bridal tour, 
and there is no wedding-day reception, the following card is sent ,

The bridal calls are not expected to be returned until the last day of 

Ve T e he i0 bridegroom gives to the first groomsman the control of the cere- 
mony and money for the necessary expenses. The first groomsman prc- 
s n s tL bouquet for the bride, leads the visitors up to the young couple 
o the words of congratulation, gives the clergyman his fee, engages t

carriages, secures tickets, checks l>a_ cures pleasant seats, if the 

happy pair start l>y rail for the "moon"; and, in short, makes all arraiiL 

incuts. 

If the wedding takes place iu the church, the front seats in the bod}' of 
the clmreh are reserved lor tlie relative-; of tin' young couple. The bride 
7iuist not be kept waiting. The clergyman should be within the rails, tin- 
bridegroom and groomsmen should be in the vestry-room by the time the 
bride is due at the church. The bridesmaids .should receive the bride in 
the vestibule. 

The bridal party meets in the vestry-room. Then the bride, leaning 
on the arm of her father, leads the procession ; the bridegroom, with the 
bride's mother upon his arm, follows: then groomsmen and bridesmaids 
in couples follow. 

At the altar the bridegroom receives the bride, and the ceremony be- 
gins. The groomsmen stand behind the bridegroom, and the bridesmaids 
behind the bride. In some churches, the bride and bridegroom remove 
the right-hand glove; in others it is not considei :tial. The bride 

stands on the left of the groom. 

When the wedding takes place at the house of the bride, the bridal party 
is grouped behind folding doors or curtains ere their friends see them. 
If, however, this is not convenient, they enter in the same order as in 

church. 

The first bridesmaid removes the bride's left-hand glove for the ring. 

After the ceremony, the bride and groom go in the same carriage from 
the church to the house, or from the house to the railway depot or boat. 

The bride does not change her dress until she assumes her travelling 
dress. Her wedding gown is worn at the breakfast. 

Friends of the family should call upon the mother of the bride during the 
two weeks after the wedding. 

Mourning must not be worn at a wedding. Even in the case of a wid- 
owed mother to either of the happy pair, it is customary to wear gray, or 

me neutral tint. 

It is no longer the fashion at a wedding or wedding reception to con- 
tulate the bride ; it is the bridegroom who receives congratulations ; 
the bride wishes for her future happiness. The bride is spoken to first. 

Tlie day being fixed for the wedding, the bride's father now presents 
her with a sum of money for her trousseau, according to her rank in life. 
A f>'w days previously to the wedding, presents are also made to the bride 
by relations and intimate friends, varying in amount and value according 
to their various degrees of relationship and friendship such as plate, fur- 



310 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

niture, jewellery, and articles of ornament as well as of utility, to the 
newly-married lady in her future station. These, together with her 
wedding dresses, etc., it is customary to exhibit to the intimate friends of 
the bride a day or two before her marriage. 

Duty of a Bridegroom-Elect. 

The bridegroom-elect has, on the eve of matrimony, no little business 
to transact. His 6rst care is to look after a house suitable for his future 
home, and then, assisted by the taste of his chosen helpmate, to take steps 
to furnish it in a becoming style. He must also, if engaged in business, 
make arrangements for a month's absence ; in fact, bring together all mat- 
ters into a focus, so as to be readily manageable when, after the honey- 
moon, he shall take the reins himself. He will do well to burn most of 
his bachelor letters, and to part with, it may be, some few of his bachelor 
connections ; and he should communicate, in an easy, informal way, to his 
acquaintances generally, the close approach of so important a change in 
his condition. Not to do this might hereafter lead to inconvenience, and 
cause no little annoyance. 

We must now speak of 

Buying the Ring. 

It is the gentleman's business to buy the ring; and let him take 8pi.mil 
care not to forget it, for such an awkward mistake has frequently happened- 
The ring should be, we need scarcely say, of the very purest gold, but sub- 
stantial. There are three reasons for this ; first, that it may not break a 
source of great trouble to the young wife ; secondly, that it may not slip 
off the finger without being missed few husbands being pleased to huar 
that their wives heve lost their wedding rings ; and thirdly, that it may 
last out the lifetime of the loving recipient, even should that life be pro- 
tracted to the extreme extent. To get the right size required is not one 
of the least interesting of the delicate mysteries of love. A not unusual 
method is to get a sister of the fair one to lend one of the lady's rings to 
enable the jeweller to select the proper size. Care must be taken, how- 
ever, that it is not too large. Some audacious suitors, rendered bold by 
their favoured position, have been even known presumptuously to try the 
ring on the patient finger of the bride-elect ; and it has rarely happened in 
such cases that the ring has been refused, or sent back to be changed. 



WHO SHOULD BE BRIDESMAIDS. 311 

Who should be asked to the Wedding. 

The wedding should take place at the house of the bride's parents or 
guardians. The parties who ought to be asked are the father and mother 
of the gentleman, the brothers and sisters (their wives and husbands also, 
if married), and indeed the immediate relations and favoured friends of 
both parties. Old family friends on the bride's side should also receive 
invitations the rationale or original intention of this wedding assemblage 
being to give publicity to the fact that the bride is leaving her paternal 
home with the consent and approbation of her parents. 

On this occasion the bridegroom has the privilege of asking any friends 
he may choose to the wedding ; but no friend has a right to feel affronted 
at not being invited, since, were all the friends on either side assembled, 
the wedding breakfast would be an inconveniently crowded reception 
rather than an impressive ceremonial. It is, however, considered a matter 
of friendly attention on the part of those who cannot be invited, to be 
present at the ceremony in the church. 

Who should be Bridesmaids. 

The bridesmaids should include the unmarried sisters of the bride ; but 
it is considered an anomaly for an elder sister to perform this function. 
The pleasing novelty for several years past of an addition to the number 
of bridesmaids, varying from two to eight, and sometimes more, has added 
greatly to the interest in weddings, the bride being thus enabled to diffuse 
& portion of her own happiness among the most intimate of her younger 
friends. One lady is always appointed principal bridesmaid, and has the 
bride in her charge ; it is also her duty to take care that the other brides- 
maids have the wedding favours in readiness. On the second bridesmaid 
devolves, with her principal, the duty of sending out the cards ; and on the 
third bridesmaid, in conjunction with the remaining beauties of her choir, 
the onerous office of attending to certain ministrations and mysteries con- 
nected with the wedding cake. 

Of the Bridegroomsmen. 

It behooves a bridegroom to be exceedingly particular in the selection 
of his friends who, as groomsmen, are to be his companions and assistants 
on the occasion of his wedding. Their number is limited to that of the 
bridesmaids one for each. It is unnecessary to add that very much of 
the social pleasure of the day will depend on their proper mating. Young 



312 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA, 

and unmarried they must be, handsome they should be, good-humoured 
they cannot fail to be, well-dressed they will of course take good care to 
be. Let the bridegroom diligently con over his circle of friends, and select 
the comeliest and the pleasantest fellows for his own train. The principal 
1 iridegroomsman, styled his " best man," has, for the day, the special charge 
of the bridegroom ; and the last warning we would give him is, to take 
care that, when the bridegroom puts on his wedding waistcoat, he does 
not omit to put the wedding ring into the corner of the left-hand pocket. 
The dress of a groomsman should be light and elegant ; a dress-coat, for- 
merly considered indispensable, is no longer adopted. 

Etiquette of a Wedding. 

The parties being assembled on the wedding morning in the drawing- 
room of the residence of the bride's father (unless, as sometimes happens, 
the breakfast is spread in that room), the happy corttye should proceed to 
the church in the following order : 

In the first carriage, the bride's mother and the parents of the bride- 
groom. 

In the second and third carriages, bridesmaids. 

Other carriages with the bride's friends. 

In the last carriage, the bride and her father. 






Costume of the Bride. 
A bride's costume should be white, or some hue as close as possible to i 

Costume of the Bridegroom. 

Formerly it was not considered to be in good taste for a gentleman to 
be married in a black coat. More latitude is now allowed in the costume 
of the bridegroom, the style now adopted being what is termed morning 
dress: a frock coat, light trowsers, white waistcoat, ornamental tie, and white 
or gray gloves. 

The Marriage Ceremony. 

The bridegroom stands at the right hand of the bride. The father stands 
just behind her, so as to be in readiness to give her hand at the proper mo- 
ment to the bridegroom. The principal bridesmaid stands on the left of the 
bride, ready to take off the bride's glove, which she keeps as a perquisite and 
prize of her ofh'cc. 



TllK V.'KDDIXc; JiKKAKFAST. 313 

The Words "I Will" 

are to lie pronounced distinctly and audibly by both parties, such being the 
all-important part of the ceremony as respects themselves; the public de- 
livery, before the priest, by the father of his daughter to the bridegroom, 
bring an evidence of his assent; the silence which follows the inquiry for 
" cause or just impediment" testifying that of society in general ; and the 
" I will " being the declaration of the bride and bridegroom that they are 
voluntary parties to their holy union in marriage. 

The Words "Honour and Obey" 

must also be distinctly spoken by the bride. They constitute an essential 
part of the obligation and contract of matrimony on her part. 

After the Ceremony. 

the clergyman usually shakes hands with the bride and bridegroom, and 
the bride's father and mother, and a general congratulation ensues. 

The Return Home. 

The bridegroom now leads the bride out of the church, and the happy 
pair return homeward in the first carriage. The father and mother follow 
in the next. The rest "stand not on the order of their going," but start 
off in such wise as they can best contrive. 

The Wedding Breakfast. 

The bride and bridegroom sit together at the centre of the table, in front 
of the wedding cake, the clergyman who performed the ceremony taking 
his place opposite to them. The top and bottom of the table are occupied 
by the father and mother of the bride. The principal bridesmaid sits to 
the left of the bride, and the principal briclegroomsman on the left of the 
bridegroom. It may not be necessary to say that it is customary for the 
ladies to wear their bonnets just as they came from the church. The 
bridesmaids cut the cake into small pieces, which are not eaten until the 
health of the bride is proposed. This is usually done by the officiating 
clergyman, or by an old and cherished friend of the family of the bride- 

>om. The bridegroom returns thanks for the bride and for himself. 
The health of the bride's parents is then proposed, and is followed by those 



314 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

of the principal personages present, the toast of the bridesmaids being 
generally one of the pleasantest features of the festal ceremony. After 
about two hours, the principal bridesmaid leads the bride out of the room 
as quietly as possible, so as not to disturb the party or attract attention. 
Shortly after it may be in about ten minutes the absence of the bride 
being noticed, the rest of the ladies retire. Then it is that the bridegroom 
has a few melancholy moments to bid adieu to his bachelor friends, and he 
then generally receives some hints on the subject in a short address from 
one of them, to which he is of course expected to respond. He then with- 
draws for a few moments, and returns after having made a slight addi- 
tion to his toilet, in readiness for travelling. 

Departure for the Honeymoon. 

The young bride, divested of her bridal attire, and quietly costumed 
for the journey, now bids farewell to her bridesmaids and lady friends. A 
few tears spring to her gentle eyes as she takes a last look at the home 
she is now leaving. The servants venture to crowd about her with their 
humble but heartfelt congratulations ; finally, she falls weeping on her 
mother's bosom. A short cough is heard, as of some one summoning up 
resolution to hide emotion. It is her father. He dares not trust his voice ; 
but holds out his hand, gives her an affectionate kiss, and then leads her, 
half turning back, down the stairs and through the hall, to the door, 
where he delivers her as a precious charge to her husband, who hands her 
quickly into the carriage, springs in after her, waves his hand to the party 
who appear crowding at the window, half smiles at the throng about the 
door, then, amidst a shower of old slippers missiles of good-luck sent fly- 
ing after the happy pair gives the word, and theyare off, and started 
on the long-hoped-for voyage ! 



iLhc language of JFlotocvs. 




OW the universal heart of man blesses flowers ! They are 
wreathed round the cradle, the marriage-altar, and the 
tomb. The Persian in the far East delights in their per- 
fume, and writes his love in nosegays; while the Indian 
child of the far West claps his hands with glee as he 
gathers the abundant blossoms, the illuminated scrip- 
tures of the prairies. The Cupid of the ancient Hindoos 
tipped his arrows with flowers, and orange-flowers are a 
bridal crown with us, a nation of yesterday. Flowers 
garlanded the Grecian altar, and hung in votive wreath before the Chris- 
tian shrine. All these are appropriate uses. Flowers, should deck the 
brow of the youthful bride, for they are in themselves a lovely type of 
marriage. They should twine round the tomb, for their perpetually re- 
newed beauty is a symbol of the resurrection. They should festoon the 
altar, for their fragrance and their beauty ascend in perpetual worship 
before the Most High. 

Flowers have a language of their own, and it is this bright particular 
language that we would teach our readers. How charmingly a young 
gentleman can speak to a young lady, and with what eloquent silence in 
this delightful language. How delicately she can respond, the beautiful 
little flowers telling hrr tale in perfumed words ; what a delicate story 
the myrtle or the rose tells ! How unhappy that which bazil, or the 
yellow rose reveals, while ivy is the most faithful of all.

vlhc better col vitcr. 




position in life demands letter- writing. A letter 
is the great link between parents and children, between 
lovers, between friends ; while in business relations it 
makes fortunes, or mars them. A good letter must, 
firstly, be absolutely correct in every mechanical de- 
tail ; then style comes into question ; then the matter, 
which must be intelligible to the meanest as well as 
the highest understanding. The great art of letter- 
writing is to be able to write gracefully and with 
ease, and no letter should wear the appearance of having been laboriously 
studied. 

The first point to be observed in your letter is that you write in a clear, 
legible hand, a hand that anybody and everybody can read. You may 
fill your pages with the most exquisite and sparkling ideas, but if they 
cannot be read except to the torture of the peruser, your diamond 
thoughts lose all their glitter, and people to whom you write, instead of 
being anxious to receive a letter from you, will mentally groan at the 
very idea of its receipt, knowing the toil and trouble that awaits them in 
its perusal. 

Be patient, then, and plod on steadily until you write a bold, clear, 
clean hand, and never let a scrap of your writing pass from you that is 
not carefully executed. 

Never erase. It is much better, though wearying the task, to com- 
mence all over again. An erasure is a sore to the eye. 

Orthography is next to be considered. Bad spelling is disgraceful, and 
many people spell badly from simple carelessness. Read carefully the 
works of the best authors. Write extracts from these works, and you 
will intuitively spell correctly. Your sense will become offended at a 
misspelt word. Use the simplest language. Always have a dictionary 
(pocket) beside you, but never consult it unless you are in doubt. Once 
consulted, you should remember the word ever afterward. Never divide 
your words into syllables at the end of the lines unless you cannot help 



326 THE HOME, FATvM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA.. 

it. If you have space for the first syllable, let your hyphen be bold 

Thus: 

It is sometimes a great con- 
solation to me that, etc., etc. 

A word of one syllable must not be divided. Bring it bodily over to 

the next line. 

Compound words must be divided into the simple words composing 
them. Thus : War-whoop, not warw-hoop ; bread-stuff, not breadst-uff. 

GKAMMAR 

Place your verbs correctly at all hazards. Never use the adverb for 
the adjective, or the adjective for the adverb. Never take liberties with 
the relative pronouns, or mingle in dire confusion tenses and moods. A 
careful study of the admirable grammar in this cyclopedia will keep the 
letter writer in the straight path. 

PUNCTUATION. 

In order to have the meaning of words readily understood, it becomes 
necessary to divide' those words into paragraphs, sentences and clauses, 
by means of punctuation. As an instance of the absence of punctuation 
and the farcical result, just read this : 

Lost on King Street on Thursday evening last an umbrella by an 
elderly gentleman with a carved ivory head. 

Take the following rules and mark them well : 

Put a comma wherever you would make a trifling pause, were you 
speaking ; as, " He came, he saw, he conquered." 

A semicolon makes a longer pause, and an incomplete sentence ; as, 
" Julia is handsome ; Agnes is beautiful." The semicolon separates the 
sentence more distinctly than the comma. 

The colon marks a sentence which is complete in itself, but is followed 
by some additional remark ; as, " Shun vice : it will lead to ruin." 
colon is also used to precede a quotation, and point it off from the rest of 
the sentence ; as, Shakespeare says : " Assume a virtue, if you have : 

not." 

A period is used to denote that a sentence is complete ; as, " A bird 

the hand is worth two in tlie bush." 

The dash is used to denote a sudden pause, or abrupt change of sense 
as, " I have loved her madly, wildly but why speak of her ? 



CAPITAL LETTERS. 327 

The interrogation point is used only after a question ; as, " Why did 
you say so ? " 

The interjection point is used only to denote an exclamation ; as, 
" Alas ! all my joys have flown ! " 

The parenthesis is used to enclose a portion of a sentence which if left 
out would not destroy the sense ; as, " I value this flower (a faded flower) 
very highly." 

The apostrophe is used to mark the possessive case, and also the omis- 
sion of a letter or letters in a word ; as, " Frederick's hair is black," or, 
" Gen'l Grant is getting old." 

The carat is used to mark an omitted word, which word must be writ- 
ten immediately above it ; as, 

wet 
" What a day ! " 

A 

The hyphen is used to connect compound words, and at the end of a 
line shows that more syllables are carried over to the next line. 

Quotation marks are used before and after every quotation, to separate 
and define it ; as, " Many are called, but few are chosen." 

CAPITAL LETTEES. 

The capital letters only set apart the sentences and paragraphs, but 
while their proper use adds greatly to the beauty of an epistle, their omis- 
sion or improper use will make the pages present a perfectly absurd 
appearance. 

Begin every paragraph with a capital letter. 

Begin every sentence following a period with a capital letter. 

Begin all proper names with a capital letter. 

Begin all titles, as Lieut. Governors, Vice-President, General, Doctor, 
or Captain, with a capital letter. 

Begin all names of places, as Montreal, St. Catharines, Niagara, with a 
capital letter. 

Begin the words North, South, East, West, and their compounds and 
abbreviations, as North-east, S. W., with a capital letter. 

Begin the names of Deity and Heaven, or the pronoun used for the 
former, as, in His mercy Thou, Father, with a capital letter. 

Begin all adjectives formed from the names of places or points of the 
compass, as English, Northern, with a capital letter. 

Begin every line of poetry with a capital letter. 

Begin all quotations with a capital letter. 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Begin all titles of books, and usually each important word of the title, 
as, Collins' " Life of Sir John A. Macdonald." 

Begin the name of any historical event, as the Civil War, with a capi- 
tal letter. 

The pronoun I and the interjection must invariably be written with 

a capital letter. 

Begin all the names of the months, as June, April, with a capital letter. 

Begin all addresses, as, Dear Sir Dear Madam, with a capital letter. 

Capital letters must never be placed in the middle of a word ; never, 
except in accordance with the foregoing rules, in the middle of a sentence. 

STYLE. 

You cannot blindly follow any rules as regards style, as your style will 
ever be yolir own. Quote as little as possible, and be niggardly with 
your adjectives. Avoid long sentences, and florid language. Parentheses 
should be carefully punctuated ; as, " John (who is, as you are aware, a 
confirmed toper) is considerably better." 

Be very careful not to repeat the same word. Tautology is a crime in 
writing. Read this and see how you like it : 

" Willie has come. Johnny will come to-morrow. Will you come and 
spend a day with us ? Make Susie come. Summer has come at last." 

This is tautology. Do not underline unless in very extreme cases. 

" You know, darling, how intensely I love you," is perhaps excusable. 

Never abbreviate except in business. Dates should be given in figures, 
and money, in parentheses, thus ($10,000). Date carefully. 

Begin a letter this way : 

WINNIPEG, MAN., 

June 1st, 1883. 

or, 

TORONTO, Sept. 7th, 1883. 

Avoid postscripts. They are only embarrassing. Take your envelope, 
and having neatly folded your letter, place it in the envelope, close the 
envelope and write in the most legible manner :

REPLIES. 

There is no greater mark of good-breeding and politeness, than the 
prompt reply to a letter. Never lose a moment, if possible, in replying to 
one. If the reply requires delay, write to acknowledge receipt of the 
letter. Never reply by proxy if you are able to write yourself. 
Never write oa a half -sheet of paper. 
Avoid pedantry. 

Never write a congratulatory letter upon mourning-paper, even if you 
are in mourning. 

Never try to patch an ill-formed letter. 

It' you add your own address to a letter, put it under your signature, 
thus : 

Very respectfully, 

ROBERT R. WHITE,

Never write an anonymous letter. Treat it with silent contempt. 

Never gossip. Friendly intelligence, if you are certain it is true, may 
be communicated. 

Date every letter clearly and carefully. It is often of the utmost im- 
portance to know when a letter was written. 

Sit erect when writing, as, if you write constantly, a stoop will surely 
injure your figure and your health. 

We give examples of the forms of letters in general use. These will act 
as guides to the inexperienced.

LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION. 

Never seal a letter of introduction. Mention the business in which the 
party whom you are introducing is or was engaged. Write the name of 
the party introduced in the left-hand corner of the envelope containing 
the introduction. Thus ; you wish to introduce Mr. Charles G. D. Roberts, 
of Fredericton, N. B., to Prof. Goldwin Smith, of Toronto. Direct your 
letter as below : 



If you want to be stylish, send your letter of introduction, with your 
aid, by the servant at the private residence of the person to whom you 
are introduced. Send a letter with your card if you present it at a mer- 
chant's office.

SIR, I venture to hope that you will 
call all your friendly feelings to my assist- 
ance , in considering a proposal I am about 
to lay before you, in which my happiness 
is completely concerned. 

For a long time past your daughter, 
Effie, has held a strong hold over my af- 
fections, and I have reason to believe that 
I am not indifferent to her. My position 
is such as to warrant my belief that I could 
support her in the style of comfort which 
she so well deserves, and which it has 
been your constant aim to provide for 
your children. As regards my character 
and disposition, I trust they are sufficient- 
ly w ell known to you to give you confi- 
dence in the prospect of your child's hap- 
piness. 

I have not, however, ventured on any 
express declaration of my feelings, with- 
out first consulting you on the subject, as 
I feel persuaded that the straightforward 
course is always the best, and that a par- 
ent's sanction will never be wanting when 
the circumstances of the case justify its 
being accorded. 

Anxiously awaiting the result of your 
consideration on this important and inter- 
esting subject, 

I remain, sir, 

Your most faithful and obedient servant, 
EDWARD L. SPRING.

1 thank you very much for the manly

anil honourable way in which you have 
addressed me in reference to my daugh- 
ter's hand. I have long since perceived 
that your attentions to her were of a 
marked character, and that they appeared 
to give her much pleasure. I know no 
reason whatever to oppose your wishes, 
and, if 1 may judge from the manner in 
which she received the communication 
from myself, i/ou will find a by no means 
unwilling listener. 

Dine with us to-morrow at six o'clock, 
if you are not engaged, and you will then 
have an opportunity of pleading your own 
cause. Meanwhile, believe me, with every 
confidence in your integrity and good 
feeling, 

Yours most sincerely,

DEAR SIR : 

It is always painful to return an unfa- 
vourable answer, but such is unfortunate- 
ly my task on the present occasion. 

My daughter has for a long time been 
engaged to a gentleman whose character 
and position give her no cause to regret 
the engagement. At the same time she 
duly appreciates the compliment implied 
by your preference, and unites with me in 
the sincere wish that, as an esteemed 
friend, you may meet with a companion in 
every way calculated to ensure your hap- 
piness. 

Believe me, dear sir, 

Your sincere friend.

MY DEAR MADAM : 

I am emboldened to lay open to you the 
present state of my feelings, being so con- 
vinced of your good sense and amiable dis- 
position, that I feel assured you will deal 
candidly with me in your reply. 

Like yourself, 1 have been deprived of 
the partner of my early life, and as I ap- 



proach the middle state of existence, I 
feel more and more the want of some kin- 
dred spirit to share with me whatever 
years are reserved to me by Providence. 
My fortune is such as to enable me to sup- 
port a lady in the manner which I feel to 
be due to your accomplishments and posi- 
tion, and I sincerely hope that you will 
think carefully over my proposal ; and, if 
you can make up your mind to share my 
fortune and affections, I trust that no ef- 
forts will be wanting on my part to en- 
sure you the happiness you so well de- 
serve. 

I need scarcely say that an early answer, 
on a matter so much connected with my 
future happiness, will be a great favour to, 

My dear madam,

DEAREST ELIZABETH : 

You have doubtless received letters from 
me lately, describing my situation here, 
and stating the projects that I had under 
consideration. In one of those letters, al- 
lusion is made to a speculation in land in 
the neighbourhood of this place, with the 
remark that, if it were successful, I should 
be able to make good my promise, and 
claim you as the partner of my joys and 
sorrows for life. My most sanguine ex- 
pectations have been more than realized. 

Herewith you will receive a draft on the 
Ontario Bank, in your city, for 500, of 
which I pray you to make use in provid- 
ing such articles as may be necessary to 
replenish your wardrobe, in anticipation 
of our speedy marriage, after my return 
home. Pray present your dear mother 
with my affectionate regards, and say that 
J can never forget, now that I have the 
power, that it is my duty to assist and 
cherish her declining years. I also send 
some few trinkets, made of Leadville gold, 
which you will please present on my be- 
half to your sisters, as tokens of my bro- 
therly regard ; for such 1 now consider 
my relations toward them.

A Complaint. 



DEAR MAUDIE 



July 10, 1883. 



It is with pain I write to you in aught 
that can seem like a strain of reproach, 
but I confess that your conduct last night 
both surprised and vexed me. You re- 
ceived Mr. Watson's attentions in so 
marked a way that I feel it due to your- 
self to comment on your conduct. Be- 
lieve me, [ am in no way given to idle 
jealousy ; still less am I selfish or un- 
manly enough to wish to deprive any girl 
on whom 1 have so firmly fixed my affec- 
tions of any pleasure to be obtained in 
good society. But my peace of mind 
would be lost for ever, did I believe that 
I had lost one atom of your affections. 

Pray write and assure me that you still 
preserve your undivided affection for 
Your devoted but grieved

For loan oft loses both itself and friend."

found to be the safest, and, in the long 
run, the kindest course for all parties.

Letters of condolence, though a neces- 
sity between friends, are very difficult to 
compose, since the more earnestly and 
touchingly they are written, the more 
deeply will they prube the wounds still 
bleeding under the stab of affliction. The 
shorter such letters are, the better. Let 
them be short and sincere, and always 
wind up with a hope that Providence will 
assuage the grief with which it has pleased 
Him in his far-seting wisdom to afflict your 
friend.

a short time I shall be able to fulfil any 
duties assigned to me. 

In the event of your doing me the 
honour to select me for the preferred em-

could, if necessary, provide guarantees for 
fidelity.

When you left Halifax, you were kind

your power to forward my interest in any 
manner you would feel a pleasure in so 
doing. I am now in want of a position, 
my former employer having sold his busi- 
ness, and his successor having, as he in- 
forms me, a sufficient number of hands 
for all the work he is likely to have. If, 
therefore, you should hear of any situation 
or employment which you consider likely 
to suit me, either in my own business?, 
that of a clerk, or in any other in which 
I can make myself useful, your recom- 
mendation would greatly oblige, and be 
of material service to, 

Dear Edward,

DEAR SIR : 

As I have had the honour of being

which period I trust my conduct has im- 
pressed you favourably, I take the liberty 
of soliciting at your hand the following 
favour : 

Messrs. Sibthorp, of Beaver Street, New 
York, are in want of a correspondent at 
London, and as I am about to proceed 
there on some affairs of my own, and shall 
probably take up my residence in that 
capital for some years, I am anxious to 
secure a post which appears to me in every

way eligible, and accords with my views 
exactly. 

As a matter of course, Messrs. Sibthorp 
desire testimonials as to my capacity and 
integrity, and as you are in a position to 
speak positively on these points, I have 
written to ask you whether I may so far 
trespass on your kindness as to mention 
your name by way of reference. 

Should you kindly grant this request, 
I need scarcely assure you that my endea- 
vour will be to prove both to Messrs. Sib- 
thorp and yourself that you have not been 
mistaken in your opinion of me, while I 
shall ever feel grateful for this further in-

Speeches. 




SPEECH should be short and to the point. Remember 
that brevity is the soul of a speech. A long speech, 
unless the speaker be exceptionally eloquent, or the oc- 
casion exceptionally mandatory, is one of the greatest of 
possible inflictions. Some men love to hear themselves 
talk, and, quite oblivious of the feelings of their listeners, 
continue to drone out laboured sentences and weary pla- 
titudes until politely coughed or buzzed down. These 
men ought to be indicted as nuisances. 
The specimen speeches which we present in this Cyclopaedia are merely 
meant to act as guides. They show the form of speech most popular, and 
give the length that is likely to be received with approval. Of course 
there are occasions when a long speech is absolutely necessary. The toasts 
and sentiments embrace all subjects, and are suited to occasions of a 
festive character. 

A Public Officer, on retiring, is Presented with a Souvenir. 

SIR, Your friends and their name is legion cannot permit you to retire into pri- 
vate life without a direct expression of their esteem and regard. 1 am desired on their 

part to present you with the accompanying as a very slight token indeed of 

their appreciation of so admirable an officer, so good a citizen, and so perfect a gentle- 
man. 

Reply. 

SIK, To have won your approval, and that of the friends you so kindly represent, 
is indeed sweeter to me than anything else that life, with all its prizes, could offer. I 
am bold enough to say that I have endeavoured to win the good-will of my fellow- 
citizens of all grades and classes, but I am modest enough to assure you this gracious, 
superb, and totally unexpected offering so completely affects me, as to leave me poor in 
speech, but rich in thankfulness and gratitude. My children and children's children 
shall treasure this souvenir, as the prize won in the big light by at least the honest 

efforts of their sire. 

The Ladies. 

Where is the man who, upon one occasion or another, has not been called upon to 
respond to the toast of " The Ladies?" The following will enable the bashful youth 
to train his ideas in regard to the subject, and to prepare him with a reply when the 
mine shall have been sprung upon him. A ready response to this most popular of all 



SPEECHKS. 34.5 

toasts is as necessary as it is graceful and manly; so let there be no hemming or hawing, 
no hesitations, stutterings or stammerings, but start to your feet at once and dash into 
the subject as though you were enchanted at the privilege : 

MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN 

The high, the glorious privilege has been accorded me of replying to the toast of 
" The Ladies." You could not have selected a better man. Impossible ! This you will 
say is rather cheeky of me ; but when I tell you that there breathes not a man who 
reveres, loves, and adores the sex so much as I do, I ask you in all honesty, could the 
chance of replying to the toast have fallen upon more deserving shoulders ? The ladies, 
God bless them ! what would we do without them that nearer, clearer, dearer heaven 
of stars ! In their smiles lie our sunshine, in their tears our anguish, in their beauty 
our heartaches. To the ladies we owe all the refining influences of our lives. They 
are the bright flowers by the wayside, the quite too tenderly utter beings, who make, 
niar, and marry us. 

Then here, gentlemen, is my response to the toast of The Ladies. May they ever 
shine like stars in our firmament, never cease to captivate us, and, when we desire it, 
of rewarding us. The ladies, God bless them ! 

Another Reply. 

The toast to which I have the honour of responding is one that awakes in the manly 
heart the latent chivalry of manhood. The toast of The Ladies embraces womanhood, 
the mother, the wife, the daughter, the sister, and if you will, gentlemen, the cousins 
and the aunts. Sir Walter Scott has beautifully written : 

" O woman ! in our hours of ease, 
TTncrrtain, coy, and hard to please, 
And variable as the shade 
By the li:,'ht quivering aspen made ; 
When pain and anguish rack the brow, 
A ministering angel thou ! " 

What an admirable delineation of woman's character ! In our hours of ease, on the 
stoop, or by the stove, there is no doubt of it, gentlemen, that she is uncertain, extre- 
mely coy, and infernally hard to please I mean at times while as for her variability, 
she is as whirly-giggy as a weather-cock on a windy March morning. But here is the 
other side of the shield, the silver one. Have any of you ever been ill ? Have any of 
you ever been smitten to the earth by grief or misfortune } I hope not ; but if such 
has been your bitter experience, turn back on your memories for the tender sympathy, 
the unfailing devotion, the ceaseless graciousness of woman. Gentlemen, this is a 
theme upon which, like the brook, I could " run on for ever ;" yet, delightful as it is, 
time flies, and perhaps the time that I am spending in reply to the toast of The Ladies, 
could be far better spent in their company. Gentlemen, I return you my most heart- 
felt thanks for being called upon by you to reply to such an important and gracious 
toast. 

Presentation of a Piece of Plate to a Public Official. 

SIR, It affords me intense pleasure to represent a committee, who in turn represent 
your numerous friends and admirers, and ou their behalf to present you with this 
as a very slight token of their appreciation of the admirable and praiseworthy 






34G THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

manner in which you have discharged the onerous and responsible duties appertaining 
to your position. Your high character, integrity, and zeal have notonly won the esteem 
and confidence of your friends, and of those brought into immediate contact with you, 
but have radiated far and wide, so that you have reached the position one that is net 
only a credit to yourself but to the country at large. 

That you may long continue in the service which you so admirably adorn is the wish 
of the many to whom your virtues are as household words. With this souvenir let me, 
on the part of those whom I represent, wish you health, happiness and prosperity. 

Reply. 
MR. AND GENTLEMEN : 

I need hardly say with what gratitude I accept this splendid gift a gift which is 
dearer to me than all the "gold of Ind," since it comes from a set of friends whose ' 
endorsement on a bad bill no amount of treasure could purchase. 

Gentlemen, my aim in life has been to do what is right, to labour with earnestness, 
to win on the merits. My efforts have been crowned with success, and in this superb 
souvenir, I recognise my crown of victory. 

Gentlemen, your too flattering recognition will but serve as a greater impetus to 
exertion, and, rest assured that no effort on my part shall be wanting to repay in the 
fullest measure of my capacity the compliment it has pleased you this day to bestow 
upon me. 

Presentation to a Teacher by the Young Lady Pupils. 

DEAR TEACHER : 

It devolves upon me to offer you, in the name of the young ladies of this school, a 
slight token of our esteem and regard. To myself it is a source of immense pleasure to 
be made their mouthpiece on this occasion, since my sincere delight may make some 
amends for my many shortcomings. I am not now addressing you as our teacher, but 
as our friend, our dear, trusted, and very much tried friend ; for how often have we 
not tried your temper and your forbearance ! Dear Teacher, we will ever keep your 
image enshrined in our hearts, and shall look back to the school, not as an abode of 
penance, but rather of pleasure, since your kindness and your amiability have so rend- 
ered it our studies having been illuminated by your patient graciousness. The little 
gift we offer you is of no intrinsic value, but it is rich in love, and gratitude, and res- 
pect. Please accept it, and with it our united hopes that your life will ever be as happy 

as you have made ours. 

Reply. 
MY DEAR PUPILS : 

1 find that my heart is so anxious to speak that it has almost paralyzed my lips. Yes, 
it is indeed my heart that returns thanks to yours, for I know how pure, gentle, gener- 
ous, strong, and true your hearts are, and my heart says to yours, " Oh, how deeply 
grateful I am for this tender mark of your affection ! " My dear pupils, if you have 
been a little inclined to what shall I call it ? not idleness no, no well, a word from 
me ever brought you back from the plucking of the flowers of fancy, and a rebuke was 
but a reminder that you should tread the path of study for yet a little while. My life 
has been rendered doubly pleasant in the sunshine of your youth, and that I shall hold 
a place in your esteem and affection is indeed a delightful reward. That I thank you 
for your gift it is needless to say, Ah ! would that one spark of eloquence of some of 
the masters over whom we have studied together were given to me now, to let you 



SPEFA'HE*. 

know what I feel on this occasion, which shall ever be remembered as one of the bright- 
est resting places in my journey through life. 

A Bachelor. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 

It seems rather hard that I, an unfortunate bachelor, should be singled out to reply 
to this toast. Surely the misfortune of being unable to meet a fair one to share my lot 
ought to have won your sympathy, ana to have left me unnoticed, save by what the 
poets are pleased to term the " passing tribute of a sigh." 

Ladies, it is no fault of mine that I am unmated. I detest, abhor, loathe bachelor- 
hood would that I could find stronger terms of detestation and if Fate, Kismet, 
Destiny, call it what you will, were to place some charming blushing maiden, such as I 
see around this board to-night, in my path, I would consider myself the most blessed of 
human mortals. What more contemptible being than the old bachelor ! who so lonely, 
who so uncared for, who so infamously selfish ! Of course, ladies, I allude to those 
cravens who have feared to risk their fate on that sweet small word, " Yes." I must 
myself confess to a certain cowardice, and, with Sir Walter Raleigh, exclaim, " Fain 
would I climb but that I fear to fall." Oh, if some fair lady would but say, " If thy 
heart fail thee do not climb at all ! " That I live in hope, white blossomed Hope, I do 
not deny, and whatever be my fate now, in the presence of such charming and beauti- 
ful witnesses, I denounce bachelorhood and despise the bachelor. 

The Host 
GENTLEMEN : 

Fill your glasses till the beaded bubbles at the brim topple over. This is a toast that 
to honour is a sacred duty. I give you the health of our host God bless him! 

Reply. 

GENTLEMEN : 

I thank you most heartily for the manner in which you have drank the toast of my 
health. I assure you from my heart that I never feel so happy as when I see myself 
surrounded by my friends, and to behold one's friends enjoying themselves is a sight 
tit for the gods. 

In the battle of life, which we are all compelled to fight, it becomes necessary to halt 
occasionally, stop by the wayside, and refresh. This brief snatching of pleasure at its- 
best, makes us all feel that there is something worth living for, and that life without 
fritnds would indeed be but a dismal blank. I again thank you for your gracious good 
fellowship, and promise you that no effort shall be wanting on my part to enable you to 
propcse the same toast, under the same circumstances, again, again, and yet again. 

A Distinguished Guest. 
GENTLEMEN: 

A duty, and a most pleasant one, devolves upon me of proposing the health of a very 

distinguished gentleman, who has honoured us with his presence this evening. Mr. 

has done us the very great favour of joining our circle, and we feel the most intense 
pleasure in doing honour to a citizen who has so justly elevated himself in the opinions 
and good wishes of his fellow-countrymen. Were Mr.- absent I could talk about 
him for " a long hour by Shrewsbury clock,' 1 but as he is present I will endeavour to 
spare his blushes, and come at once to the drinking of his health in a bumper. Gentle- 
men, long life, prosperity and happiness to our distinguished guest, Mr. . Three 

times three and a tiger ? Take the time from me ! Hip, etc. 



348 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP.EDIA. 

Reply. 
MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN: 

Our worthy host intimated that he wished to spare my blushes. Xow it is so long 
since 1 blushed, that I forget the sensation, but I declare that I could find this no occa- 
sion to blush, save for very pleasure, since to be thus introduced, and thus toasted is 
indeed an occasion so pleasurable to me, that it shall ever remain impressed on the 
tablets of both my memory and my heart. 

It is indeed a source of intense gratification to me to find that my little efforts, so 
far as they have gone, are appreciated, and by gentlemen such, as I see around this 
board. True it is that I have done but little ; but, gentlemen, I assure you my object 
is to do a great deal, and failing in that, I have but done my share. If, however, I am 
to do my share in this evening's bout, I am extremely gratetul to our respected chair- 
man, for giving me an opportunity of speaking so early in the evening, as later on 
well, least said sooner mended. 

Wedding-day Anniversary. 

This is indeed an occasion where a speech is utterly unnecessary, for the fact of our 
being here speaks so eloquently, that the words even of a Demosthenes or a Cicero 
would fall fl.tt, stale, and unprofitable. 

Ladies and gentlemen, just cast a glance at that happy man, our host, and that beau- 
tiful lady, our hostess. See the " heavenly assenting smile " that speaks of the tend- 
rest devotion, of a happiness those who wed whom they love, alone can know. The 
sunshine of unalloyed felicity is a nimbus to their lives, and it is well that, as the clock 
strikes another year upon their wedded bliss, we should be here to congratulate and 
ay, God bless them both. 

That their journey of life will be always as smooth as it is now, and that they may 
ever be protected from storm and strait, is the sentiment I would couple with the 
health of our dear friends, Mr. and Mrs. , on this the anniversary of their wed- 
ding. 

Reply. 

MY VERY DEAR FRIEND* 1 

As a rule, no husband is perfectly safe in replying for his wife, since that much-to- 
be respected party is usually so capable of replying for herself, and as on too frequent 
occasions, her sentiments differ a little from his. On this occasion, however, I reply 
for my dear wife, knowing that every word I say will be endorsed by her, and that 
every beat of her heart is in accord with mine. 

This is indeed a very joyous anniversaty. It recalls the delicious rapture of the 
moment when I first could call my cherished partner by that sacred and endearing 
term of wife. It recalls the moment when she placed her happiness in my hands ; and, 
my dear friends, I ask of you if that smile which puckers round her mouth now, does 
not do me. infinite justice ? If 1 have not been disappointed in her, I trust in God she 
has not been disappointed in me, and as years pass around, and, Darby and Joan like, 
we descend the hill, may this anniversary ever prove a resting-place for happy retros- 
pection. 

Crystal Wedding. 

In this age of transparency, when glass has arrived at such perfection, it behooves 
us upon this, the anniversary of the crystal wedding of our dear friends, to " hold the 
mirror up to nature,'' and let thtm view themselves in the glass we now place before

them. The lady smiles, as well she may, for Time's glass has not shaken out a single 
sand, and the fifteen years that have passed since she made our host the happiest of 
men, have left scarce a trace upon her pellucid brow. 

The crystals which we present our dear friends upon this auspicious and delightful 
occasion, are but a type of the transparency and brightness of their lives. May they 
never look on life " as through a glass darkly." May the goblets which stand upon the 
festive board ever brim with the nectar distilled from, love and harmony, and may 
these glass pitchers, and bowls, and decanters serve as crucibles through which their 
silver and golden anniversaries may yet be passed, and in this joyous and sympathetic 

company. 

Reply. 
DEAR FRIENDS : 

True it is that we have been married fifteen long years, yet it seems to me that 

is just as young, just as fresh, just as lovely as when, on this day fifteen years ago, t 
took her for better or for worse. Yet, dear friends, I like this celebration. It reminds 
us that we have reached one of the great resting-places on the line, and that, whilst we 
look back with intense pleasure upon our journey, we also anticipate a great deal more 
farther on the road. It is indeed a source of intense gratification to us to find that, 
after fifteen years, so many friends came to visit us as we rest by the wayside, bring- 
ing gifts and bidding us to be of good eheer. These anniversaries are a sacred insti- 
tution, and as you were good enough to express a hope that these beautiful goblets 
might prove crucibles, let me now engage each and every one of you, not only to our 
silver and gold, but to our diamond weddings. I now drink your healths, thanking 
you for my fifteen-year partner from the bottom of my heart. 

Silver Wedding. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN : 

On a certain day, just twenty-five years ago, a certain lady and gentleman entered 
for the race of life, and they have, I am delighted to declare, won the plate. Behold 
it ! [I'oints to gifts.] They have, to continue the parlance of the turf, run neck and 
neck, and come in to this the winning-post in the easiest of possible canters. Ladies 
and gentlemen, let us drink to the winners, and let us earnestly hope that they may 
be matched for the gold plate, and that we may be present when the " little event " 
comes off. 

Ladies and gentlemen, need we say how deeply we congratulate our dear friends ? 
Is not this occasion a lesson to rapids and bachelors ( Never were there words more 
applicable, " Go and do likewise." I shall conclude, for I see that you are all eager to 
do honour to my toast, by quoting Sheridan: 

" Ah, sure a pair were never seen 
So justly formed to meet by nature." 

Their healths God bless them ! 

Golden Wedding-. 

This is indeed a grand occasion, and one which, while it brings joy and thankfulness 
to flur hearts, bears with it one of the most beautiful and touching lessons in the book 
of life. 

Our respected and venerable friends have indeed reached the golden age of maturity. 
Hand in hand have they ascended the hill, hand in hand are they descending into the 



;^ THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

valley, a valley lighted with the undying and unahifting lamp of faithfulness, love and 
devotion. What a privilege for us to be here to witness this beautiful sight, to see the 
bride and bridegroom of to-day in soul, in heart, the bride and bridegroom of this day 
half a century ago ! 

Time has sown fresh flowers in their dear old hearts ; time has garlanded their brows 
with choicest flowers ; time has but mellowed their affections which, like good wine, 
have but improved with age. 

We have come here to felicitate them upon the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage, 
to wish them many a long year yet before they snap the golden link that bound them 
together ; that their bark may sail upon a golden sea, and that their sunset may be 
golden, in our united sentiment. 

Congratulating a Candidate. 

SIR, It it not in mortals to command success, but, what is better, they ahould 
endeavour to deserve it. You have been successful because you have deserved it, and 
we come to exdianye congratulations, since whilst we rejoice for you, you undoubtedly 
rejoice with us. We have won a proud victory, but much of the glory is due to our 
standard-bearer. That you will conscientiously and worthily fill the office which has 
been bestowed upon you is beyond the region of doubt. 

We have done honour to ourselves by proposing so clear-headed aud able a candidate, 
and you, sir, will do honour to us by pursuing in your new position that pure and 
unsullied line of conduct which has this day led us to nominate you for election. 

We do not attempt to exult over the defeated candidate. We can afford to be magna- 
nimous, and since we are now so worthily represented, we feel assured that the enemy 
will regard you as the exponent of their opinions, as much as we shall. Sir, we cor- 
dially congratulate you on a well merited success, and we congiatulate you, and con- 
gratulate the good cause. 

Reply. 
GENTLEMEN : 

Deeds, not words, is my motto. That I thank you, and the energetic workers in the 
good cause 1 which has led to this triumph, a triumph in which I am personally inter- 
ested, need scarcely be said. I am as yet an untried man, but it is my purpose to prove 
to you that your votes of to-day have not been thrown away, and that you have 
honoured an individual, who will at least endeavour to prove his gratitude by head, 
heart, and unflagging work. The good cause has indeed triumphed, and I pledge my- 
self that the trust you have this day reposed in ma shall lose nothing from being 
placed in my hands. I shall endeavour to the bast of my poor ability to walk in the 
straight path, and to discharge the duties appartaini ig to my office without fear or 
favour. Once more I thank you for the high honour you have done me.

OEGANIZING ASSOCIATIONS. 

HEN it is advisable to form a society, club, or other asso- 
ciation for any specific purpose, those who agree in 
regard to its formation may meet upon private notice 
or public call. The mode of organizing the meeting is 
similar to that of any other. 

As soon as the meeting lias been organized, and the 
chairman announces that it is ready to pioceed to busi- 
ness, some one of the originators, previously agreed 
upon, should rise, and advocate the formation of the 
club or society required for the purpose set forth in the call, and end by 
moving the appointment of a committee to draft a constitution and by- 
laws. This committee should be instructed to report at the next meeting. 
A convenient time of adjournment is fixed on, and if there be no further 
business, the meeting adjourns. 

When the time for the second meeting arrives, the same officers con- 
tinue, without any new motion. If either be absent, his place is supplied, 
on motion, by some other. The Committee on the Constitution and By- 
kws reports. If the constitution is not accepted, those present suggest 
amendments. As soon as it has taken the required shape, it is adopted, 
and signed by those present. The by-laws are treated in the same way. 

The society is now formed, but not fully organized. The officers pro- 
vided for by the constitution have now to be elected. This may be done 
at that meeting, or the society may be adjourned over for that purpose. 
So soon as it has been done, the chairman of the meeting gives way to the 
newly-elected president, or, in his absence, to a vice-president ; the secre- 
tary of the meeting vacates his seat, which is taken by the newly elected 
secretary or secretaries, and thus the organization of the new body is 
complete. 



352 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

FORMS OF CONSTITUTIONS. 

A constitution is the formal written agreement, making the fundamental 
law which binds the parties who associate. In preparation of this, useless 
words should be avoided. 

The constitution, after having been adopted, should be engrossed in a 
blank book, and signed by the members. Amendments or alterations 
should be entered in the same book, with the date of their adoption, in the 
shape of a copy for the minutes ; and a side-note inserted in the margin 
of the constitution, opposite the article amended, showing on what page 
the amendment may be found. 

LYCEUMS OR INSTITUTIONS. 

PREAMBLE. Whereas, experience has shown that knowledge can be 
more readily acquired by combination of effort than singly, we, whose 
names are hereunto annexed, have agreed to form an association, to be 
known as [here insert title], and for its better government, do hereby estab- 
lish the following constitution: 

ARTICLE I. The name, style, and title of this association shall be [here 
insert name], and its objects shall be the increase and the diffusion of 
knowledge among its members. 

ARTICLE II. 1. The officers of this association shall consist of a presi- 
dent, two vice-presidents, a corresponding secretary, a recording secretary, 
a treasurer, a librarian, and a curator, who shall be elected annually on 
[here insert time of election and mode, whether by open voice or by ballot]. 

2. The said officers shall hold their offices until their successors shall 
have been elected ; and their powers and duties shall be similar to those 
of like offices in like associations. 

ARTICLE III. There shall be appointed by the president, immediately 
after his election, by and with the consent of the association, the follow-

any person residing within the limits aforesaid may be chosen^in like 



FORMS OF CONSTITUTIONS 333 

manner, a corresponding member; and any person who is eminent in sci- 
ence or literature, may be elected an honorary member. 

2. Each and every resident member, upon his election, shall sign this

RULES OF ORDER. 

QUORUM. 

1. A quorum is a sufficient number to legally transact business. A 
majority of the members of any association constitutes a natural quorum ; 
but a smaller number is usually made a quorum by a provision to that 
effect in the constitution or by-laws, through motives of convenience. 

2. If there be a quorum present at the hour named for the meeting, or 
within thirty minutes thereafter, the presiding officer takes the chair, and 
calls the association to order ; if not, he waits a reasonable time, and from 
the chair announces that no quorum is present. Thereupon no further 
business is in order, except to adjourn for want of a quorum. But it will be 
in order to call the roll of members, and to make endeavour to obtain the 
presence of enough to form the quorum. 

3. During the transaction of business, should it be observed that no- 
quorum is present, the chair may announce the fact, or any member may 
call for a count. If, on counting, it be found that there is no quorum, 
business is suspended until a quorum be found. If not to be had, the 
meeting must be adjourned. 

4. If, on calling the ayes and noes, or on a division, a quorum be not 
found, the vote is null, and at the next meeting the unfinished business is- 
in the exact state it was when the absence of a quorum was discovered. 



CALL. 



1. On a call of the body, each member rises as he is called, and answers 
to his name, and the absentees are noted. In a small body it is not neces- 
sary to rise. 



MINUTES. 



1. The presiding officer having taken the chair, and a quorum being 
present, the minutes are read. If there be any mistakes in the record, 
these are amended, and then the minutes are adopted. If, under any cir- 
cumstances requiring haste, or in the absence of the journal, the reading of 
the minutes be suspended, they may be either read and adopted at ano- 
ther stage of the proceedings, or at the next succeeding meeting. Never- 
theless, the minutes being a record of facts, any error subsequently dis- 
covered may be amended at any time. This may be done by unanimous 
consent ; or, if objection be made, then any member who voted in the 
affirmative on their adoption, can move a reconsideration of the motion to- 



RULES OF ORDER. 



adopt. This last motion prevailing, the minutes are open to amendment ; 
and after being amended, the motion on their adoption as amended is put. 

2. The rule of record in ordinary associations is somewhat different from 
that in legislative bodies. The minutes of the former stand in lieu of the 
journals of the latter. The former never contain a question which is in- 
terrupted by a vote to adjourn, or to proceed to the order of the day ; the 
the latter always do. Even propositions withdrawn, or ruled out of order, 
may be entered, as so treated. The minutes are to be full and explicit,' 
and a true record of all that was done, but not of all that was said, unless 
the latter be necessary to the clear understanding of the business. 

3. Proceedings in committee of the whole are, of course, not entered on 
the minutes the entry merely that the committee rose and reported thus, 
and so, and what was done thereon by the association. 



PRESIDING OFFICER. 



In the absence of the president, or in case he declines, the vice-president 
takes the chair. If there be more than one vice-president, then they take 
it in their numerical order, unless the association, by vote, designate a par- 
ticular one. If neither president nor vice-president be present some mem- 
lier is called to act temporarily as chairman, on motion put by the mover 
thereof. 

RECORDING OFFICER. 

In the absence of the secretary, or, if more than one, in the absence of 
all, a temporary secretary must be appointed on motion. 

ARRANGEMENT OF BUSINESS. 

This, in associations, is usually provided for in the by-laws. If not other- 
wise provided for, it is as follows : 1. Reading the minutes ; 2. Reports 
of standing committees ; 3. Reports of special committees ; 4. Special 
orders ; 5. Unfinished business ; 6. New business. The election of new 
members, unless otherwise ordered, is always in order; and the election of 
officers ranks as a special order ; but an election of members is not in 
order while other business is pending, or while a member has the floor. 



ORDERS. 



There is only one case where a member has a right to insist on anything, 
and that is where he calls for the execution of an existing order. No de- 
bate nor delay can be had on it ; but where it is for an order of the day, 



g 56 THE HOME, FAKM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

fixing some particular business to be taken up, then the president, on cnll 
of a "member, puts the question whether the association will proceed to 
the order of the day. If it is decided in the negative, that is, in effect, a 
reversal of the former order, and the association decides to proceed to other 
business. 

COMMITTEES. 

1. Standing committees are appointed under the constitution or by- 
laws of the association, or by resolution, and sit permanently, while special : 
committees are usually appointed by resolution to attend to some particu- 
lar business, which being done, they are usually discharged. 

2. The first-named person acts as chairman of any committee. It is 
true that the committee possesses the inherent power to choose its own 
chairman ; but custom prevents this power from being used. Should a 
committee select some other than the first-named as chairman, it would 
be considered a wanton insult. 

3. It is always proper to place the mover of a successful motion on any 
committee arising through his resolution, and to name him first ; but if the 
committee is upon an inquiry into his conduct, or where its deliberation 
concerns himself personally, or his manifest interest, the rule is not 

followed. 

4. As near as they will apply, the rules of order of the main body govern 

the deliberations of committees. 

5. A committee to whom a resolution or affirmative proposition is com- 
mitted should always have a majority of members, if they can be had, 
favourable to such resolution or proposition. 

6. Unless otherwise ordered, the chair appoints all committees. 

7. When there is a standing committee on any subject, anything refer- 
ring to such subject should be referred to that committee alone ; but it 
may be given to a special committee, if the association think proper. 

8. Standing committees require no order to report. They are always 
in session, and should report at every meeting, if only to report progress. 

9. A committee cannot sit while the main body is in session, unless so 

ordered to do. 

10. A majority of a committee must concur in a report ; but the min- 
ority are never refused leave to bring in a counter report. 

11. Sometimes a majority cannot be found, when the committee should 
report the fact of their disagreement, and ask leave to be discharged ; 
they are then to be discharged, and either a new committee raised, or the 
subject brought before a committee of the whole, or before the main body. 



KULES OF ORDER. 3.57 

12. Persons appointed upon a committee should join that committee so 
n as they are notified of their appointment, unless they are excused ; 
as it is the duty of the first-named memlter of the committee to call his 
fellows together as soon as possible. 

COMMITTEE OK THE WHOLE. 

1 . If it be necessary to go into committee of the whole society, either for a 
general or specific purpose, it is done by motion, when the chairman va- 
cates the chair, and calls some member to it to act as chairman ; though the 
committee of the whole, if it chooses, can select another chairman like any 
other committee. This it never does. 

The quorum of the committee is the same as that of the main body. If 
a quorum be found wanting, the committee has to rise, the regular chair- 
man takes his seat, and the chairman of the committee informs him that 
the committee rises for want of a quorum. Then the usual course is 
taken in regard to the absence of a quorum. 

2. If any communication be made to the main body while in committee 
of the whole, the committee cannot receive it. If its reception be neces- 
sary, the committee have to rise. 

3. If there be confusion or disturbance in committee of the whole, the 
president may take the chair, declare the committee dissolved, and reduce 
the body to order. In that case it requires another motion for that com- 
mittee to sit again. 

4. A committee of the whole cannot adjourn, but it must rise. It can- 
not take the previous question, nor take the ayes and noes. 

5. If the business before the committee of the whole be unfinished, it 
rises on motion, the regular presiding officer takes the chair, and the chair- 
man of the committee reports that the committee of the whole have, ac- 
cording to order, considered the business assigned to them, and have made 
progress therein, but, not having time to conclude the same, ask leave to 
sit again. Leave is then granted on motion. If the subject be a special 
one, and it is concluded, the motion is that the committee rise and report 
proceedings ; then, when the president takes the chair, the chairman of the 
committee reports that the committee have gone through the business re- 
ferred to them, and ask leave to report. Leave is then given to report 
then, or at some other time, either by motion, or, should Jjiere be no ob- 
jection, on the call of some member. 

6. In committee, members may speak oftener than once on the same 
gubject, and are not confined strictly to the subject-matter. With these 



358 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

and the foregoing exceptions, the same rules of order govern the com- 
mittee of the whole as govern the main body. 

7. A motion to rise and report progress is in order at any stage of the 
business, and is to be decided without debate. When they have reported, 
they may be discharged on motion, which brings the matter laid before 
them directly before the association itself. 

COMMITMENT. 

1. If it be desired to refer a resolution, address or other matter to a com- 
mittee, it is done on motion. If to a special committee, the chair names 
the committee. Any member present may suggest one member on that 
committee, and if the main body do not object the chair will name him, 
since the silence of members in that case is equivalent to a direct appoint- 
ment of that person by the association. But such a course is unusual, and 
generally improper. 

2. Though the majority on a committee should be favourable to a mea- 
sure, the minority may be of those who are opposed to it in some particu- 
lars. But those totally opposed to it should never be appointed ; and if 
any one of that view be named, he should rise and state the fact, when the 
main body will excuse him from serving. 

3. If it be a written matter which is referred, the secretary delivers it 
to the first named of the committee. 

4. A committee meets when and where it pleases, unless the time and 
place is fixed for it. But it cannot act unless its members assemble to- 
gether. 

5. The committee cannot change the title or subject of the matter before 
it, but otherwise have full power over it. 

6. If it be a written matter before it, if it originate with the committee, 
the writing must be considered paragraph by paragraph, and the question 
put on each. After each paragraph is approved or amended, it is then 
considered as a whole. If it has been referred, the committee only report 
the amendments they recommend separatel} 7 ; as they have no right to 
amend a paper belonging to the main body. 

7. When the committee is through, some member moves that it rise, and 
report the matter to the main body, with or without amendments, as the 
case may be. 

REPORTS OF COMMITTEES. 

The chairman of the committee, standing in his place, informs the asso- 
ciation that the committee to which was intrusted such a matter, naming 



RULES OF ORDER. 359 

it, have directed him to report thereon, and moves that the report be re- 
ceived. The cry of " Receive ! " or " Report ! " or " Read it ! " from any 
one, generally dispenses with the formality of a question. He then reads 
the report, whatever it may be, and delivers the written report to the 
secretary. Then it lies on the table until called up by a motion. The 
committee is dissolved, and can act no more unless reconstituted for the 

purpose by a vote. 

MOTIONS. 

1. A motion is a proposition by two members; consequently, if not 
seconded, it is not to be entertained. This is different, however, in the 
case of an appeal, where the question may be put on the demand of one 
member. 

2. A motion must be put in writing, if any member desires it, and read, 
when required for information. But if the demand for the reading be re- 
peated, so as to show itself a mere pretext for delay, the association may 
order it to be read no more. 

3. A motion for adjournment cannot be made while one member is 
speaking; because it is a breach of order for one to speak when another 
has the floor, except to a point of order ; consequently, even a privileged 
motion cannot be entertained. And even on a call to order, decided 
against him, he must still be allowed to go on, provided he does not persist 
iii the same violation of order in his remarks. 

AMENDMENTS. 

1. An amendment takes the place of the question it is proposed to amend, 
and must be decided first. So an amendment to an amendment must be 
decided before the first amendment. 

2. But amendments cannot be piled one on the other ; that is, while you 
can amend an amendment, you cannot amend the second amendment. 

3. For example : it is moved to give the thanks of the association for 
his kind gift of fifty volumes to the society. It is moved to amend by 
striking out the word " kind " and inserting " generous." This is an amend- 
ment. It is then moved to strike out the word " generous " and insert 
that of " liberal." This is an amendment to the amendment. It is then 
proposed to strike out the word " liberal," and insert thatof " munificent." 
This third amendment is out of order. 

4. Nor can amendments be made to certain privileged questions. Thus, 
an amendment to a motion to adjourn, for the previous question, a call of 
the house, or to lay on the table. 



360 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

5. But an amendment, though inconsistent with one previously adopt- 
ed, is still in order. It is for the association alone to decide whether, by 
the passage of the second amendment, it will recede from its former action. 

G. On an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken to the 
main question, may speak to tlie amendment. 

7. If it be proposed to amend by leaving out certain words, it may be 
moved to amend the amendment by leaving out a part of the words of the 
amendment, which is equivalent to letting those words remain. 

8. For example : the original words being " Resolved that we have heard 
with feelings of lively satisfaction that the authorities of our town propose 
to tax dogs, and approve their action," it is moved to amend by striking 
out the words " with feelings of lively satisfaction." If it be moved to 
amend the amendment, by striking out the words " with feelings of satis- 
faction," the question would be : Shall those words stand as part of the 
resolution ? If carried, the word " lively " is struck out, and the rest re- 
mains. The question then recurs on the resolution as amended. 

9. When it is proposed to amend by inserting a paragraph, or part of 
one, the friends of this should make it perfect by amendments ; because if 
it be inserted it cannot be amended, since it has been agreed to in that 
form. So if proposed to amend by striking out a paragraph, the friends 
of the paragraph should also make it as perfect, by amendments, as pos- 
sible ; for if the striking out be negatived, that is equivalent to agreeing 
to it in that form, and amendments are not admissible. 

10. When it is moved to amend by stinking out certain words and in- 
serting others, the manner of stating the question is, first to read the whole 
passage to be amended, as it stands at present ; then the words proposed 
to be struck out ; next those to be inserted ; and, lastly, the whole passage 
as it will be when amended. And the question, if desired, is then to be 
divided, and put first on striking out. If carried, it is next on inserting 
the words proposed. If that be lost, it may be moved to insert others. 

11. A motion is made to amend by striking out certain words and in- 
serting others in their place, which is negatived. Then it is moved to 
strike out the same words, and to insert others of a tenor entirely different 
from those first proposed, which is negatived. Then it is moved to strike 
out the same words and insert nothing, which is agreed to. All this is in 
order ; because to strike out A and insert B, is one proposition. To strike 
out A and insert C is another proposition. To strike out A and insert 
nothing, is another proposition. The rejection of either proposition does 
not preclude the offering of a new one. But a motion to strike out alone 
being voted down, is equivalent to voting that the words should stand. 



Kl'J.KS OF ORDER. 361 

and amendments are not in order. Jefferson thinks that even if the ques- 
tion be divided, and taken first on the striking out, and that fails, amend- 
ments are in order, because the proposition is only half put. There is force 
in this, and it seems to be the practice. 

12. After the paragraph is amended, it nevertheless may be further 
amended by striking it entirely out. 

PRIVILEGED QUESTIONS. 

1. " When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received but to 
adjourn, to lay on the table, to postpone indefinitely, to postpone to a day 
certain, to commit, or to amend ; which several motions shall have prece- 
dence in the order they stand arranged ; and the motion to adjourn shall 
be always in order, and shall be decided without debate." 

2. These privileged questions shall not only be entertained while the 
main question is pending, but will be put before it. 

3. A motion to adjourn takes precedence of all others, because otherwise 
the body might be kept sitting against its will, and indefinitely. Yet even. 
this question cannot be entertained after another question is actually put, 
and while members are voting upon it. 

4. An order of the day that is, a question which has previously been 
set down to be argued or determined on that day takes precedence of all 
questions except adjournment. If, for instance, a matter be set down for 
seven o'clock, then at that hour, although another question may be before 
the body, a motion to proceed to take up the order of the day must be 
received by the chair. 

5. These privileged questions sometimes conflict with each other, but are 
reconciled under known rules. 

6. If the previous question be first moved, it is first put. This cuts off 
all the others. The society, having decided to take the question, must 
vote on it as it stands postponement, commitment, and amendment being 
out of order. 

7. If postponement be carried, of course the question cannot be either 
committed, amended, nor the previous question be carried, for the subject 
is not before the body. 

8. If committed, the same rules and reasons follow. 

9. If amendment is first moved, the question on that must be determin- 
ed before the previous question. 

10. If amendment and postponement are proposed, the latter is put 
first. The reason is, that the amendment is not suppressed, but comes up 
again in its order whenever the main question is again considered. 



302 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

11. If a motion for amendment be followed by one for commitment, the 
latter shall be put first. 

12. The previous question cannot be put on the motion to postpone, 
commit, or amend the main question. 

13. The motion for the previous question, or for commitment or amend- 
ment, cannot be postponed. 

14. A motion made for reading papers relative to the question discussed, 
must l>e put before the main question. 

15. A motion made and seconded cannot be withdrawn without leave, 
though, if no member object, it is not necessary to put the question. 

1C. When different sums or dates are used in filling blanks, the question 
shall first be put on the largest sum and the longest time. 

17. In commitment, the motions to commit are privileged in the follow- 
ing order : 1. Committee of the Whole ; 2. Standing Committee; 3. Spe- 
cial Committee. 

18. A motion to lay on the table must be put before either postpone- 
ment, commitment, or amendment, although neither of these last can be 
laid on the table. 

19. A postponement can be amended as to time, and an amendment 
can be amended ; but if it be proposed to amend by inserting anything, a 
motion to amend or perfect the matter proposed to be inserted must be 
put to a vote before the question to insert. The same rule follows in re- 
gard to striking out. 

20. A question of privilege, such as a quarrel between members, or af- 
fecting the character of members, or the main body, must be disposed of 
before the original question be disposed of. 

21. Questions on leave to withdraw motions, or appeals from the deci- 
sion of the chair, have a precedence over the main question. 

PREVIOUS QUESTION. 

1. Wlien any question is before the association, any member may move 
that the main question be put ; and this is termed moving the previous 
question. If the motion pass in the affirmative, the main question is put 
immediately, and no further debate is allowed upon the matter at issue. 

2. This is frequently styled " the gag law," because its adoption cuts off 
all debate. When a subject in the judgment of the majority has been ex- 
hausted, or when personalities have been introduced, and disorders are 
threatened, it is a very proper and wise thing ; but it should not generally 
t>e brought to bear so long as members who desire to speak are unheard. 



lU'LES OF ORDER. 3(33 

DIVISION OF THE QUESTION. 

1. A question which contains more parts than one may be divided, on 
the demand of a member, provided the main body concur. If the question 
contain parts which are evidently incompatible, the presiding officer may 
divide them of his own will, unless the body deny him the power. 

2. When a question is divided, after the question has been taken on the 
first member of it, the second member is still open to amendment and de- 
bate, unless the previous question be taken upon it. 

COEXISTING QUESTIONS. 

1. Occasionally there are two questions up at the same time one prim- 
arily, and the other secondarily. Are both subject to debate ? 

2. When it has been moved to commit a question, the main question is 
debatable under that motion ; but no amendment can be entertained, be- 
cause the question of commitment will be first put. 

EQUIVALENT QUESTIONS. 

Where questions are equivalent, so that the rejection of one is the af- 
firming of the other, that necessarily determines the latter. Thus, a vote 
against striking out is virtually the same as a vote to agree ; a vote to 
reject is equivalent to a vote to adopt ; but, on a motion to strike out A 
and insert B being decided in the negative, this does not preclude the 
motion to strike out A and insert C, these being separate questions. 

THE QUESTION. 

1. The question is first to be put on the affirmative, and then on the 
negative side. 

2. After the question has been put, debate upon it is out of order ; but 
after the presiding officer has put the affirmative, any member who has 
not spoken before on the question may speak before the negative be put, 
for it is not a full question until the negative be put. 

3. But on trifling matters, such as leave to bring in reports of commit- 
tees, withdrawing motions, reading papers, and such like, the consent of 
the main body will be supposed without the formality of a question, 
unless some one should object, for the absence of an objection in such 
cases testifies to unanimous consent. 



364 THE HOME, FARM A>'D BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA, 

DIVISION. 

1. The affirmative and negative voices having been heard upon a ques- 
tion, the presiding officer declares by the sound what is the result. If he 
have doubts as to the relative strength of yeas and nays, or if any member 
demands it, before other business has been gone into, then a division is 
ordered. 

2. The mode of dividing is for those in the affirmative to rise, when the 
presiding officer counts those, and announces the number. These sit, and 
those in the negative arise, to be counted in like manner. 

3. One-fifth of the members present may call for the yeas and nays, 
each member's name being called, and his answer entered by the secre- 
tary. 

In case of any disorder during a division or calling of the yeas and 
nays, the presiding officer decides the question of order ; and the decision 
is not the subject of appeal at this time, although it may be revised after 
the division or call is over. (See Rule XXXIII.) 

RECONSIDERATION. 

1. A question which has been decided either in the affirmative or in 
the negative, may be reconsidered upon the motion of a member who has 
voted with the majority. But this motion for reconsideration will not 
be in order, unless made during the meeting whereat the question was 
decided. 

2. The effect of the adoption of a motion to reconsider is to place the 
question in the position it occupied before the vote on its adoption or re- 
jection was taken ; consequently it is as open to amendment, postpone- 
ment, commitment, or laying on the table, as it was at that time. 

APPEALS. 

1. An appeal from the decision of the chair is a matter of right, and 
brings under review and opens to debate the grounds of such decision. 

2. The presiding officer, by usage and courtesy, has the right to assign 
his reasons for his decision before the question is put on the appeal. 

3. The question on an appeal is, whether the decision of the presiding 
officer shall stand as the judgment of the body itself. If a majority vote 
in the affirmative, the decision stands ; if not, it is reversed. 

4. An appeal cannot be put on an appeal ; that is, a second appeal can- 
not be entertained while the first remains undisposed of. 



RULES OF ORDER. 



365 



5. A mere opinion of the chair, drawn out by an interrogation on points 
of order, is not subject to an appeal. To be appealed from, it must be an 
actual decision on a question coming up legitimately in the progress of 
business. 

PAPERS. 

1. When papers have been laid before the main body, or referred to a 
committee, every member has a right to hear them once read at the secre- 
tary's table, before he can be compelled to vote on them. 

2. But he has not a right, therefore, to have papers read independently of 
the will of a majority of his colleagues. If the reading be demanded 
purely for information, and not for delay, and no one objects, the chair- 
man will direct it to be done, without putting it to the question. But 
should any one object the question must be put. 

3. Nor can any member have a right, without a question first put, to 
have any thing read, which is not before the body, 

4. Nor can a member have a right to read a paper, in his place, not 
even his own speech, if it be objected to without the leave of the body. 
But this rule is not usually enforced, unless there be a gross or inten- 
tional abuse of the time and patience of the body. 

COMMUNICATIONS. 

When a communication addressed to the main body is presented, the 
question is to be put whether it shall be received. But a general cry of 
"Receive!" or, even if there be no objection, the silence of the body, is 
sufficient to dispense with the formality of the question. In that case, or 
in case the vote on its reception be in the affirmative, it is to be read un- 
less otherwise disposed of. 

THINGS ON THE TABLE. 

1. Matters which have been laid on the table can only be called up 
when the class of business to which they belong is in order. 

2. If laid on the table by a motion, they can only be lifted from it by 
a motion. If laid there under rules, as a matter of course, they can be 
called up by any member as a matter of right, when the business to which 
they belong is reached in its regular order. 

3. But it is deemed discourteous, when the matter lies on the table, to 
call it up in the absence of the mover, or against his wishes, if present, 
provided it refers to a matter of local or private concern, in the mover's

special charge ; and provided further, that it is not designed or calculated 
to delay final action on any measure or proposition before the body, or 
impede the progress of business. 

RESOLUTIONS. 

All resolutions must be committed to writing, if demanded, and the 
name of the mover should be signed thereto. 

RIGHTS OF MEMBERS. 

1. It is the right of a member to have the question put on bis motion, 
and a refusal to do this is a breach of order on the part of the chair. 

2. It is the right of a member to insist on the execution of a standing 
order of the body. 

And it is the right of a member, if he observe that a quorum is not 
present during the transaction of business, to call for a count.

How to Estimate Crops per Acre. 
Frame together four light sticks exactly 
a foot square inside, and with this in hand 
walk into the field and select a spot of 
fair average yield, and lower the frame 
square over as many heads as it will en- 
close. Shell out the heads thus enclosed 
carefully, and weigh the grain. It is fair 
to presume that the product will be the 
43,. COth part of an acre's produce. To 
pro ire it, go through the field and make 
ten or twenty similar calculations, and 
estimate by the mean of the whole num- 
ber of results. It will certainly enable a 
farmer to make a closer calculation of what 
a field will produce than he can do by 
guessing. 



A Mile Measure. 

A standard English mile, which is the 
measure that we use, is 5,280 feet in 
length, 1,760 yards, or 320 rods. A strip 
one rod wide and one mile long, is two 
acres. By this it is easy to calculate thn 
quantity of land taken up by roads, and 
also how much is wasted by fences.

How to Make a Barometer or Weather-Olass. 

Take a long narrow bottle, such as an 
old fashioned Eau-de-Cologne bottle, and 
put into it two and a half drachms of cim- 
phor and eleven drachms of spirits of 
wine ; when the camphor is dissolved, 
which it will readily do by slight agitation, 
add the following mixture : Take water, 
nine drachms ; nitrate of potash (saltpe- 
tre), thirty-eight grains ; muriate of am- 
monia (sal ammoniac) thirty-eight grains. 
Dissolve these salts in the water prior to 
mixing with the camphorated spirit ; then

shake the whole well together. Cork the 
bottle well, and wax the top, but after- 
wards make a very small aperture in the 
cork with a red-hot needle. The bottle 
may then be hung up, or placed in any 
stationary position. By observing the 
different appearances which the materials 
assume, as the weather changes, it be- 
comes an excellent prognosticator of a 
coming storm or of a sunny sky. In fair 
weather the mixture will remain clear. 
On the approach of a storm it will become 
cloudy, and feathery particles floating 
about in it.

THE FAEM 



Introduction. 



- 




DID hesitate at first in responding to the invitation of the 
publishers of this work, when asked to make up the agri- 
cultural part thereof, because I had never done any com- 
piling, and particularly did not care for that kind of work, 
but I never doubted the importance of the materials, and 
feeling how much we want a succinct and full manual of 
agriculture in these days, and willing to help in any sound 
education, have much pleasure in introducing this to the 
Canadian farmer. I can do so quite freely, for the simple 
reason that as the greater part of these pages is not mine, my opinion 
cannot be charged with egotism, nor with mercenary motives, having no 
business interest in its sale. 

Where can I get a first-class work on farming up to date in everything ? 
is the question asked of me by many every year, and my reply has always 
been, I do not know. I am aware that it is in view to meet this want 
shortly, by the issue of a series of Text Books, each to be confined to a 
special subject, under titles somewhat similar to those used by me in these 
chapters. Until this is done, I do not think that our young men, farmers, 
and the public will be satisfied. How well pleased Ontario would be were 
she to lead the world in this matter ! 

It is not claimed that this manual is either an exhaust or an Encyclope- 
dia. The space allowed precluded this, and made, as most writers know, 
the boiling down much more difficult than actual original material. 

But it is a sound manual on agriculture, scientific and practical. There 
is no spurious matter in it, and it is right up to date. The 1883 ranche, 
the silo, and the relation of trees to farming, for example, are, brought 
under review. There is also reference to some other modern phases of 
rural economy. The remarkable changes by present day transportation, 
the keen chemical enquiry and practical experiments on foot ; implement 
revolutions and educational work ; the flow of wealth and learning into 
land productions, and particularly the live stock interest receives a good 
share of the allotted space.

AGRICULTURE : 
ITS SCIENCE AND PRACTICE, 

WITH SPECIAL EEFERENCE TO CANADA. 




Agriculture of the 



would be interesting to know how the nations of antiquity 
tilled, and sowed, and reaped ; what crops they cultivated, 
and by what method they converted them into food and rai- 
ment. Records are meagre. 

Every reader of the Bible is familiar with its frequent 
references to Egypt as a land so rich in grain, that it not 
only produced abundance for its own dense population, but 
yielded supplies for exportation to neighbouring countries. 
Profane history corroborates these statements. Diodorus 
Siculus bears explicit testimony to the skill of the farmers of an- 
cient Egypt. He informs us that they were acquainted with the benefits 
of a rotation of crops, and were skilful in adapting these to the soil and to 
the seasons. The ordinary annual supply of grain furnished to Rome has 
been estimated at 20,000,000 of bushels. From the same author, we also 
learn, that they fed their cattle with hay during the annual inundation, 
and at other times tethered them in the meadows on green clover. Their 
flocks were shorn twice annually (a practice common in several Asiatic 
countries), and their ewes yeaned twice a year. For religious as well as 
economical reasons, they were great rearers of poultry, and practised arti- 
ficial hatching, as at the present day. The abundance or scarcity of the 
harvests in Egypt depended chiefly upon the height of the annual inun- 
dation. If too low, much of the land could not be sown, and scarcity or

famine ensued. On the other hand, great calamities befell the country 
when the river rose much above the average level. Cattle were drowned, 
villages destroyed, and the crops necessarily much diminished ; as in such 
cases, many of the fields were still under water at the proper seed-time. 

An Egyptian villa comprised all the conveniences of a European one of 
the present day. Besides a mansion with numerous apartments, there 
were gardens, orchards, fish-ponds, and preserves for game. Attached to 
it was a farm-yard, with sheds for cattle and stables for carriage horses. 
A steward directed the tillage operations, superintended the labourers, and 
kept account of the produce and expenditure. The grain was stored in 
vaulted chambers furnished with an opening at the top, reached by steps, 
into which it was emptied from sacks, and with an aperture below for re- 
moving it when required. Hand-querns, similar to our own, were used for 
grinding grain ; but they had also a larger kind worked by oxen. In one 
painting in which the sowing of the grain is represented, a plough drawn 
by a pair of oxen goes first ; next comes the sower scattering the seed from 
a basket ; he is followed by another plough ; whilst a roller, drawn by two 
horses yoked abreast, completes the operation. The steward stands by 
superintending the whole. 

The Nomades of the patriarchal ages, like the Tartar, and perhaps some 
of the Moorish tribes of our own, whilst mainly dependent upon their 
flocks and herds, practised also agriculture proper. The vast tracts over 
which they roamed were in ordinary circumstances common to all shep- 
herds alike. During summer they frequented the mountainous districts, 
and retired to the valleys to winter. Vast flocks of sheep and of goats 
constituted the chief wealth of the Nomades, although they also possessed 
animals of the ox kind. When these last were possessed in abundance, it 
seems to be an indication that tillage was practised. We learn that Job, 
whose time is by the best authorities fixed as about contemporaneous with 
that of Abraham, besides immense possessions in flocks and herds, had 500 
yoke of oxen, which he employed in ploughing, and a " very great hus- 
bandry." Isaac, too, conjoined tillage with pastoral husbandry, and that 
with success, for we read that he sowed in the land Gerar, and reaped an 
hundred fold a return which, it would appear, in some favoured regions, 
occasionally rewarded the labour of the husbandman. In the Parable of 
the Sower, our Lord (grafting his instructions upon the habits, scenery, 
and productions of Palestine) mentions an increase of thirty, sixty, and an 
hundred fold. Such increase, although far above the average rate, was 
sometimes even greatly exceeded, if we take the authority of Herodotus, 
Strabo and Pliny. 



THE A.GRICULTTTRB OF THE PAST. 381 

Along with the Babylonians, Egyptians and Romans, the Israelites are 
classed as one of the great agricultural nations of antiquitj'. Their farms 
were small, and cultivated with great care. They were favoured with a 
soil extremely fertile, which their skill and diligence kept in good condi- 
tion. The stones were carefully cleared from the fields, which were also 
watered from canals and conduits, communicating with the brooks and 
streams with which the country " was well watered everywhere," and en- 
riched by tho a] 'plication of manures. The seventh year's fallow prevented 
the exhaustion of the soil, which was further enriched by the burning of 
the weeds and spontaneous growth of the Sabbatical year. The crops 
chiefly cultivated were wheat, millet, barley, beans, and lentiles ; to which 
it is supposed, on grounds not improbable, may be added rice and cotton. 
The ox and the ass were used for labour. The word " oxen," which occurs 
in our version of the Scriptures, as well as the Septuagint and Vulgate, 
denotes the species rather than the sex. As the Hebrews did not mutilate 
any of their animals, bulls were in common use. The quantity of land 
ploughed by a voke of oxen in one day, was called a yoke or acre. 

The unrivalled literature of Greece affords us little information regard- 
ing the practical details of her husbandry. With the exception of certain 
districts, such as Boeotia, the country was naturally unfavourable to agri- 
culture. When we find, however, that valleys were freed from lakes and 
morasses by drainage, that rocky surfaces were sometimes covered with 
transported soil, and that they possessed excellent breeds of the domesti- 
cated animals, which were reared in vast numbers, we infer that agricul- 
ture was better understood, and more carefully practised, than the allusions 
to it in their literature would seem to warrant. 

Amongst the ancient Romans, agriculture was highly esteemed, and 
pursued with earnest love and devoted attention. The words which Cicero 
puts into the mouth of Cato give a fine picture of the ancient Roman en- 
thusiasm in agriculture. " I come now to the pleasures of husbandry, in 
which I vastly delight. They are not interrupted by old age, and they 
seem to me to be pursuits in which a wise man's life should be spent. The 
earth does not rebel against authority ; it never gives back but with usury 
what it receives. The gains of husbandry are not what exclusively com- 
mend it. I arn charmed with the nature and productive virtues of tho 
soil. Can those old men be called unhappy who delight in the cultivation 
of the soil ? In my opinion, there can be no happier life, not only because 
the tillage of the earth is salutary to all, but from the pleasure it yields. 
The whole establishment of a good and assiduous husbandman is stored 
with wealth ; it abounds in pigs, in kids, in lambs, in poultry, in milk, in

cheese, in honey. Nothing can be more profitable, nothing more beautiful, 
than a well-cultivated farm." 

In ancient Rome, each citizen received, at first, an allotment of about 
two English acres. After the expulsion of the kings this allotment was 
increased to about six acres. These small inheritances must, of course, 
have been cultivated by hand labour. On the increase of the Roman ter- 
ritory, the allotment was increased to fifty, and afterwards even to 
five hundred acres. Many glimpses into their methods of cultivation 
are found in those works of Roman authors which have survived the 
ravages of time. Cato speaks of irrigation, frequent tillage, and ma- 
nuring, as means of fertilizing the soil. Mr. Hoskyn, from whose 
valuable contribution to the History of Agriculture we have drawn 
freely in this historic summary, quotes the following interesting pas- 
sacre from Pliny, commenting on Virgil : " Our poet is of opinion 
that alternate fallows should be made, and that the land should rest 
entirely every second year. And this is, indeed, both true and profit- 
able, provided a man have land enough to give the soil this repose. But 
how, if his extent be not sufficient ? Let him, in that case help him- 
self thus. Let him sow next year's wheat-crop on the field where he has 
just gathered his beans, vetches, or lupines, or such other crop as enriches 
the ground. For, indeed, it is worth notice that some crops are sown for 
no other purpose .but as food for others, a poor practice, in my estima- 
tion." 

The same Cato being asked what was the most assured profit rising out 
of land, made this answer: "To feed stock well." Being asked again, 
" what was the best," he answered, " To feed with moderation." By which 
answer he would seem to conclude that the most certain and sure re venue 
was a loiu cost' of production. 

It is curious, says Mr. Hoskyn, to read such passages as these, and to 
find the very same subjects still handled, week after week, in fresh and 
ea^er controversy in the agricultural writings and periodicals of the pre- 
sent day eighteen centuries after these opinions were written. 

Under the Goths, Vandals, and other barbarian conquerors, arigculture 
in Europe, during the middle ages, seems to have sunk into the lowest 
condition of neglect and contempt. We owe its revival, like that of other 
arts and sciences, to the Saracens of Spain, who devoted themselves to the 
cultivation of that conquered territory, with hereditary love for the occu- 
pation, and with the skilful application of the experience which they had 
gathered in other lands in which they had established their power. By 
them, and their successors, the Moors, agriculture was carried in Spain to 



THE AGRICULTURE OF THE PAST. 

a height which perhaps has not yet been surpassed in Europe. It is said, 
that so early as the tenth century, the revenue of Saracenic Spain alone 
amounted to 6,000,000 sterling probably as much as that of all the 
rest of Europe at that time. The ruins of their noble works for the irri- 
gation of the soil, still attest their skill and industry, and put to shame 
the ignorance and indolence of their successors. The same remark applies 
to the Spanish dominions in South America. In the ancient empire of 
Peru, agriculture seems to have reached a high degree of perfection. The 
ruins of basins and canals, frequently carried through tunnels, prove their 
industry and skill in irrigation. One of their aqueducts is said by Mr. 
Prescott to have been traced by its ruins for nearly 500 miles. They 
cultivated the sides of mountains, by means of terraces which retained 
forced soil, and were skilled in the application of manure. That on which 
they chiefly depended was guano, and their Incas protected the penguins, 
by which it was deposited, by strict laws, which made it highly penal to 
kill one of these birds, or to set foot on the islands at breeding time. The 
Spaniards thus obtained possession of two good patrimonies, and have 
wasted them both. 

The agriculture of nearly the whole of the continent of Europe has 
made very great progress since. In Flanders, the Netherlands, Switzer- 
land, and Germany, there are certain limited districts which, in general 
management, rival, and in particular points excel, our own. In nothing is 
this more apparent than in their scrupulous economy of manure, both as 
regards its preparation and application. In Flanders, not only the con- 
tents of privies, but soap-suds, scullery-water, and slops of every kind 
containing fertilizing matters, are carefully preserved in suitable recepta- 
cles, by the town's folk and villages, from whom they are purchased by 
regular manure dealers, who come steadily round with their tub-carts to 
collect this sewage, store it in tanks, and in due time retail it to the farm- 
ers. The latter invariably have tanks of their own, in which the urine 
of their cattle and similar matters are collected. This liquid manure is 
frequently enriched by the addition of night-soil and rape-dust, and is al- 
ways stored for several months before being applied to the land. In 
South-West Germany, Switzerland and Holland, the same attention is 
paid to the preparation of liquid manure, by mingling the dung and urine 
of the cattle with water, fermenting it in tanks, and then in distributing 
it over green crops by means of barrel-carts. The following might stand 
for a description of Myre Mill, or Tiptree, but for the want of the steam- 
engine, force-pump, and underground pipes : " The cows often lie on 
smooth bricks, which are washed clean twice a day, for which purpose a 



384 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

pump is an essential appendage to a cow-house. There is generally a deep 
gutter along the wall behind the cows, into which the water and urine 
drain, the ground sloping gently towards it. The tank is either immedi- 
ately under the stable, well vaulted over, or it is so near that all the li- 
quid readily runs into it through a covered drain. The heads of the cows 
are towards the middle of the stable, and their tails over the gutter along 
the wall. The width of the building admits of two rows of cows facing 
each other, with a space between them sufficiently wide to admit a small 
cart to bring the food to them. This is universally the form of a cow- 
house in Holland. The liquid in the tank is allowed to go through the 
first stages of fermentation, during which the caustic portion of the urine 
is rendered mild, and the liquid is better fitted to be taken up by the 
fibres of the roots. In order that there may be a regular succession of 
liquid in a proper state for use, there are partitions in the tanks, and by 
means of small flood-gates in the drain which leads to it, the fresh accum- 
ulation may be directed to any one of the pits thus formed, while the ripe 
liquor may be pumped up into tubs or barrels set on wheels, to be convey- 
ed to the land. There are means of accelerating or retarding the fermen- 
tation, according to the time when the liquor is wanted. Stirring and 
admitting the air assist the process, while the addition of earth, peat, or 
ashes, and keeping out the air retard it. The efficacy of the liquid is 
much increased by adding rape-cake, and other vegetable substances. 
This is usually done a short time before it is put on the land, as it would 
otherwise ferment too much." 

But it is in the irrigated districts of Piedmont and Lombardy that a 
style of farming is to be found admirable in itself, and especially fitted to 
interest and instruct the American farmer. For not only do we find there 
the oldest, the most extensive, but the most thoroughly elaborate system 
of irrigation to be met with in Europe. 

Of the Agriculture of the Britons before the Roman invasion we have 
no certain record. Originally savages subsisting upon chance products 
of the field or the forest, the roots and the nuts, and the flesh of ani- 
mals what little they knew of agriculture during a period of a century 
or so prior to the Roman invasion was probably imparted to them by 
those who, emigrating, as tradition hath it, from Gaul, established colonies 
on the British sea-coast, and brought with them some knowledge of farm 
produce. 

Diodorus Siculus mentions that the ancient inhabitants of Britain used 
subterranean apartments in which they kept their grain, these being con-

structed of stones rudely placed together. Strabo even writes of their 
flocks and herds ; and Caesar notes that the cattle were in abundance. 

That most of the pastures of England have, in former times, been under 
tillage, will be seen by every one practised in agriculture who examines 
the ridges, furrows, banks, roadways, landmarks, cuttings, &c., still to be 
found upon them. In many instances, the carefully rounded lands, the 
highly raised headlands, the large amount of soil worked from higher to 
lower ground, and the marks of cultivation terminating at points where 
occasional floods limited the application of the ground to the growth of 
grain, are unmistakable evidences of the plough having for ages been at 
work, and the former application of the land to growing grain. 

Be all this as it may, whatever improvement agriculture had made from 
the time of the Roman invasion till the conquest of the country by the 
Anglo-Saxons, that improvement was not sustained during the period 
when the conquerors held the sway. Fond of the chase, the Anglo-Saxons 
despised the arts of tillage, and deemed them at best the fitting employ- 
ment of slaves and women. The Britons gradually sunk, therefore, into 
a depressed condition ; and with it came the loss of the knowledge of farm- 
ing, as taught them by, or obtained chiefly from, an intercourse with the 
Romans. Some idea of their wretched condition may be derived from the 
fact that associations were formed to enable a yoke of oxen and a plough 
to be kept for the united benefit of the members. At this period it was 
enacted that " no man should undertake to guide a plough who could not 
make one ; and that the driver should make the ropes of twisted willows 
with which it was drawn. 

Nor was the state of matters improved, and the condition of the hus- 
bandman much ameliorated, by the change of masters which took place 
in the Norman Invasion and Conquest ; on the contrary, they were ren- 
dered much worse. Large tracts of land which bore comparatively good 
crops of grain, were on various pretences laid waste, and converted into 
forests and hunting grounds. 

Yet it must not be supposed that the Normans brought with them no- 
thing but the art of oppression, and the love of war and the chase, Many 
of them were well acquainted with farming, and had brought with them 
the knowledge of its practice. 

Large tracts of tidal lands were reclaimed under their superintendence ; 
moors and marshy lands were taken in by them ; and while the soil, thus 
wrested from barrenness, was made to yield its produce, that of the culti- 
vated lands of old was greatly increased by their painstaking care. 



;gg(3 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Of the system of culture in use, it is difficult to form a true conception. 
Farm-yard dung was the main manure used, although marl seemed to 
have been in repute. Summer fallowing for wheat was also practised ; 
and the operations of harrowing, reaping, and threshing, closely resembled 

our own. 

From the end of the fifteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century, 
peace fortunately prevailed in England ; and although much progress was 
not made in agriculture, still it displayed, in common with other arts, the 
advantage of the peace. The art of printing gave to agriculture, as it also 
gave to the other arts and sciences, a wonderful impetus. Works began 
to be published containing records of farm practice, and rules for its guid- 
ance, as well as epitomes of the methods pursued by the ancient nations. 
During the reign of Elizabeth, agriculture greatly flourished; large tracts 
of forest and common land were taken under the plough, and those which 
had been under cultivation were improved. 

It was towards the middle, or perhaps more correctly towards the end, 
of the eighteenth century, that the value of the alternate mode of hus- 
bandry began to be appreciated, in which alternate crops ofr cereals and 
grain crops were taken from the land, the latter enabling larger supplies 
of cattle to be maintained, and, by consequence, larger supplies of manure 
to make up for the exhaustion of the land by the cereal or grain crops. 
Drainage also began to be practised on a larger scale, and on more scientific 
principles. Several new crops were added to the list of those formerly at 
the service of the farmer, as, for instance, the potato (about 1750) pre- 
viously cultivated in gardens the Swede turnip (about 1790), the man- 
gold-wurzel, and the spring variety of wheat (about 1795). In 1760 
Bakewell began his celebrated experiments on the improvement of stock, 
which resulted in completely changing their character more especially 
that of sheep and rendering them of far greater value for breeding and 
feeding purposes. In 1777 the " Bath and West of England Society " was 
instituted, having for its special purpose the improvement of agriculture. 
In 1784 the institution of the Highland Society followed ; and in 1793 the 
Board of Agriculture was formed by the legislature, and placed under the 
control of the celebrated Sir John Sinclair. 

Of the condition of Scottish agriculture in very early times, history has 
left little or no record. But as in England, so in Scotland, agriculture and 
horticulture owed much to the exertions of the monks and the religious 
communities. Of the progress agriculture, in Scotland, made during the 
seventeenth century, we have no correct means of knowing. Ray, wl:o 
visited its eastern coast in 1660, mentions that he saw little or no fallow 



THK AGRICULTURE OF THE PAST. 3s - 

ground ; some layland he noticed, which was manured with sea-weed 
barley and oats he saw, but little wheat and rye ; and of the condition of 
the peasantry, and of their industrious habits, he seemed to have formed 
a low opinion. 

Although the condition of agriculture in Scotland, in early times, was 
very depressed, judging from some enactments of the parliament of Alex- 
ander II., still some idea of correct cultivation of the soil must have been 
prevalent, from the enactment of a severe law against those who allowed 
H pi'nt'iciuus weed to grow in their fields. In the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries, oats and barley were the principal crops grown, although wheat 
seems to have been cultivated as early as the thirteenth century. One 
authority states that at this period " the peasants neither enclosed nor 
planted, nor endeavoured to ameliorate the sterility of the soil." 

At the period of the Revolution, agriculture was in very low condition 
in Scotland, so much so that many farms were unoccupied, and landowners 
were as eager to get tenants as the tenants now are to get landowners to 
let them their farms. The union of Scotland with England gave rise to a 
gradual and steady improvement. In 1723 the Society for Improvement 
in the Knowledge of Agriculture in Scotland was established; and in 
East Lothian great exertions were made by patriotic gentlemen there re- 
isident to improve the state of cultivation. " The practice of drainage, en- 
closing, summer fallowing, sowing flax, hemp, rape, turnip, and grass 
seeds ; planting cabbages after, and potatoes with, the plough, in fields of 
great extent, is introduced." Summer fallowing, mentioned in the above 
extract, was not introduced in Scotland till about this period, although in 
use in England from the time of the Saxons and Normans. From this 
period agriculture rapidly improved, till the farming of Scotland took that 
remarkably high position for which it is now so famous. 

Little can be said of the early history of the agriculture of Ireland ; for 
little information, save of a purely conjectural character, is at hand. From 
the peculiarity of the climate, which is humid, and the nature of the soil, 
a rich loam upon limestone, Ireland has chiefly been a pastoral and grazing 
country, tillage or husbandry has, therefore, been little attended to up to 
a comparatively recent period. And what husbandry has been practised 
was of the highest order, on account chiefly of the small-farm system, 
which may be said to have been the rule for many years, if it is not even 
still the rule.

iUR position in the world's main industry is assuming seve- 
ral marked features. In the first place we are no longer a 
dismembered country, and unbound by modern highways 
the great civilizer of all nations, the railway, has brought 
the Atlantic and Pacific within six days of each other, so 
that produce at the foot of the Rocky Mountains can fairly 
compete with that at Victoria, B. Columbia, at Chicago, 
Montreal, and at Halifax. Of all revolutions, this is the 
most wonderful and far-reaching in commercial significance. 
Next in importance is the application of machinery. What will follow 
the self-reaper and binder, imagination can hardly picture, but 
self is destined to place our sons at least on such independent ground as even 
the manufacturers fail to estimate. It is not to be a Dalrymple farm only 
that shall command their service, but even the ordinary farmer of Onta 
will walk out in the morning and return in the evening of one day aft 
having cut and bound his fifteen or twenty acres with one man and i 
horses What a great cause there is in this for extensive possession of landed 
property on the part of individuals, and possibly with the tendency to a 
lazier, a less systematic, and a less remunerative system of cropping. 

Then again, we are gradually drifting into a recognition of the claims pi 
wmculture as a part of national education. Its absence until recently i 
nearly all systems of public education, anywhere, has been a curious n 
consistency, difficult to explain by men outside, and yet Simple when pu 
to the men most interested. In conjunction with improved mac 
and special lines of produce, the education of the farm will hold the lead- 
in" men of advanced nations, as it did two thousand years ago. 

Thus then, another phase of to-day farming is the keen scientific en- 
quiry into things either not yet known, or so simple in themselves as 1 
bear doubt, and consequently requiring investigation. Fertilizers and 
animal foods are examples of these; their simplicity is m the hanc 
the practical farmer, their complicated workings with the scientist, wh

not satisfied with bare facts, and his indications must follow the other's 
every day lessons, which are so varied by climate, soil, plants and manage- 
ment, that the association of science and practice must continue one of 
unending interest and practical value. 

W.' do not agree with those who denounce the multiplication of agri- 
cultural exhibitions. Were they made less sectional than they are now, 
the under-average farmer would be the longer in rising, and the country 
correspondingly kept back. Exhibition lessons are not necessarily imme- 
diate in their effect, nor are they always remunerative for the time bein^. 
Educational work otherwise for the farm is precisely of the same character 
with exhibitions, and nobody will deny that the school, the college, the 
press, and books, are too plentiful. Exhibitions are a peculiar feature of 
Canadian agriculture, and it is well we should think twice ere denouncing 
their multiplication. 

The sequence of the preceding paragraph should be first class agricultu- 
ral literature as another mark of the times, but it is not so, and the reason 
is not far to seek. We are too young, not wealthy enough, and still too 
busy, to employ the best talent in agricultural literature. The Americans 
are far ahead of us in this respect, as they are actually of Britain in some 
lines of the profession. 

Neither are we on a par with our neighbours in associations for diffu- 
sion of agricultural knowledge. The origination of Societies, Clubs, and 
Associations is peculiarly American in its diffuseness, but when the day 
comes that we take the lesson, let us add continuance to the virtue. 

And again, one of the great agricultural phenomena of to-day with us, 
is patriarchal grazing of cattle. Under all the irregular and overheated 
speculation of the pioneers in this trade, our North-West ranches will come 
out refined and well marked. If winter conditions are unfavourable to 
continuous occupation, the summer by itself will suffice to make rich, and 
the coming and going that may be necessary will add to employment 
and a stricter system of jurisdiction, in which we are of opinion mutton 
and wool will take a large place. 

Finally, in those confined notes, the prominent agriculture of to-day 
in North America is making more prominent the unapprehended resources 
of the country. Not only in arable culture, but certainly in actual let- 
ting alone of nature's gifts in the form of grass, are we loosing ourselves : 
has it not been so in Manitoba, is it not so in the Eastern provinces, and 
are we taking all we should take at our own doors in Ontario ? The 
greed for land is well in respect of domination, but unwise as regards stern 
bottom, worth and solidity.

order to understand the nature of soils thoroughly, some 
knowledge of geology, mineralogy, chemistry, and physics* 
is necessary. Geology and mineralogy teach the origin, 
chemistry and physics, the composition and functions of 
soils ; and when these aspects have been studied, climate 
and all surrounding conditions must be taken into account 
before we can be in possession of full information. 

The subject may be usefully divided into the following 
sections: (1) ORIGIN, (2) FORMATION, (3) DISTRIBUTION, (4) 
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND SURROUNDING CONDITIONS, (5) CLASSIFICA- 

TION. 

1. ORIGIN OF SOILS. 

As a primary fact, it may be stated that the entire mineral matter of 
soils has been derived from the gradual decay or disintegration of rocks. 
It is usual to state that soils are derived from the decay of the crystalline: 
(primitive) rocks, because from them all intermediate and newer rocks 

have been derived. 

This decay has been effected during the lapse of long ages, by means 
natural forces still in active operation, as may be seen in the crumbling 
of building stones, and that "weathering" which gradually changes the 
hardest rock into a powdery mass. Changes of temperature, operating 
with water, in the many forms assumed by that element, the action of the 
atmosphere and vegetation, are the chief causes of decay ; and to these may 
be added volcanic action, which, as is well known, is the cause of the rapid 
formation of new and fertile lava soils. 

In dry climates, where rain seldom falls, inscriptions upon stones retain 
their freshness for thousands of years, thereby proving the extreme dura- 
bility of certain rocks when favourably situated. On the other hand, in 
a humid atmosphere, decay progresses much faster, as may be noticed m 
the crumbling condition of ruins, and even more recent buildings. 
incr certain geological epochs, the surface of our planet has been exposed 
toconditions of heat and moisture highly favourable to the decay of rock 
and under those conditions, thick beds of granite, yielding to the i 



THE SOIL OF THE FARM. 39] 

fluences brought to bear upon them, have been converted into sand and 
clay. 

2. FORMATION OF SOILS. 

Bearing in mind what has been already advanced with reference to the 
general origin of soils, we have next to inquire somewhat more minutely 
into the processes which have at length resulted in their formation. The 
first destructive or disintegrating element which operates upon a rock is 
THE ATMOSPHERE, which is brought into closer contact with the rocky 
particles through the agency of moisture, in the form of snow, rain, dew 
or mist. Through one or all of these forms of water, carbon dioxide is dis- 
solved from the air which contains it, in the proportion of 4 in 10,000 
parts. Thus the rock is brought into constant contact with a dilute solu- 
tion of carbon dioxide in water. The action of this solution is slow, but 
irresistible when allowed to proceed through long periods of time ; and 
under its action the hardest rocks, such as granite for example, yield up 
their alkalies and some silica, the felspar loses its cohesion and falls into 
a soft powder (clay), while the quartzose constituents are left in the form 
of sand. 

CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE. The foregoing effect is further expedited 
by changes of temperature, and especially by frost. Water expands as it 
freezes, and when water lodges in the interstices or pores of a porous rock, 
it suddenly expands as it congeals, and the consequence is a disruption of 
particles that speedily shows itself in the crumbling character of the rocky 
surface. 

VEGETATION. As these forces proceed, a superficial layer of variable 
thickness is produced, and at an early stage vegetation exerts its sway. 
Lichens are seen growing upon walls and the faces of quarries, and mosses 
and grasses follow at a later stage, and occupy the most unpromising situ- 
ations. The effect is to increase moisture and to accumulate vegetable 
matter or humus, which again gives rise to carbonic dioxide, and renders 
the rain still more potent in its dissolving and disintegrating action. The 
roots of plants also, no doubt, themselves exert a dissolving effect. Thus 
gradually a soil is formed, and it will be noticed that, in this case, it is 
formed in situ, or upon the rock from which it was derived. 

The forces still to notice differ from those already enumerated in their 
transporting effects, which, when added to their disintegrating action, 
render them not only accountable for the origin, but the present position 
of many soils. 



392 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ACTION OF RUNNING WATER. Particles of sand or clay once detached 
from the parent rock are quickly carried Way by the action of running 
water, and as these runnels gain strength and converge into mountain 
streams and torrents, a new manifestation of the power of water is ex- 
hibited in the wearing and undermining action which they invariably dis- 
play. The attention of tourists on the Alps is often called to deep gorges, 
at the bottom of which is heard the gurgling of the stream. The wearing 
or cutting action is to be unmistakably traced through the compact rock 
from the top to the bottom of this gorge, in the water-worn hollows where 
the stream has evidently eddied and whirled at some remote period, sixty 
or eighty feet above its present bed. 

ACTION OF RIVERS. Mountain streams converge into rivers, which carry 
with them the mineral debris of the mountains, and distribute it over the 
plains beneath. All large rivers flow, during a portion of their course, 
through fertile alluvial plains ; and further study shows that these plains 
have been deposited by the river itself, and are in fact composed of the 
mud brought from the higher grounds to be deposited at a lower level. As 
rivers widen towards their estuaries, they often deposit still more exten- 
sive tracts of " alluvium," or mud. 

The Ganges in India, and the Mississippi in North America, both afford 
remarkablelnstances of the power exercised by rivers in altering the dis- 
tribution of sea and land. In the latter case, the mud, vegetable matter, 
and timber, brought down and deposited at or near the mouth of the river, 
is rapidly filling up the Gulf of Orleans. It is difficult to draw a distinc- 
tion between the action of the sea and the action of the river in many 
of these cases, but both agents act in determining the direction of de- 
position. 

ACTION OF THE OCEAN. Almost at any part of the coast traces of the 
perpetual struggle between sea and land may be seen. 

ACTION OF ICE. The expansive force of freezing water as a means of 
breaking down rocks has been already noticed. Ice and frost also play 
an important part in the formation of soils upon a large scale. The grind- 
ing action of glaciers upon the sides of the ravines through which they 
slowly descend for a glacier is not stationary, but is actually a river of 
iceresults in glacial mud, which, as the ice melts at the lower extremity, 
is carried down by the stream that perpetually runs from the glacier. These 
streams are rendered milky or turbid by suspended matter, and it is only 
when they reach the level land at the base of the mountain that they de- 
posit their burden in the form of alluvial soil. In many cases it is carried 



THE soil. OF THE FARM. 393 

into a lake, and sinking to the bottom, continues a process which, in the 
course of time, will gradually convert the lake itself into an alluvial 
tract. 

VOLCANIC ACTION*. It is well known that lava slowly crumbles into a 
fine fertile clay. The flanks of Vesuvius and ^Etna are clothed with vine- 
yards and olive gardens, and the effects of volcanic action are observable 
in certain parts of our own country, where the active cause has long 
ceased to operate. The formation of a soil from lava is effected, first by 
the rapid cooling of the surface of the molten stream, which speedily 
cracks into a cindery or scoriaceous porous mass, and this gradually yields 
to the influences of moisture and changes of temperature, and forms a 
soil. 

PEAT. There still remains a process by which a considerable class of 
soils has been formed, differing very widely from those which have been 
described. It is that of vegetation or growth. All peats have grown, 
and their history is sometimes traceable from its commencement. Peat 
soils occur only in moderate and high latitudes, but form an important class 
of cultivated soils in some countries, a very large proportion of Ireland 
that country containing 2,800,000 acres of peat, and large tracts in 
France, Germany, Russia, and all north European countries. Peats fre- 
quently rest upon clay, and the history of their formation will be usually 
found to have been a modification of the following typical account. 

A forest or tract of brushwood i.s overblown or levelled by some severe 
wind or flood. The consequence is an interruption of the natural drain- 
age of the locality, and the inducement of a wet and spongy condition of 
soil favourable to the growth of many species of tphagnum. These plants 
have the property of throwing up new shoots while the lower extremities 
are decaying. Peaty matter also appears to be precipitated from water 
at the freezing point, when organic matter held in solution falls to the 
bottom. 

INDIGENOUS (SEDENTARY) AND TRANSPORTED SOILS. We are now able 
to divide all soils into two great classes. First, those which may be said 
to be in situ, or to remain in the position where they were originally 
formed. As an example, take the thin white soils of the Upper Chalk 
which correspond closely in character with the compact chalk rock be- 
neath. They are white, abound in flint stones, and evidently belong to 
the Chalk, and are properly termed chalk soils. So also the claya of the 
Idas, of the Weald, and of the Oxford clay, the red soils of the New and 
Old Red Sandstone, and the " brashy " light soils of the Lower Oolite, all 
partake of the nature of the underlying rock, and are distinctly influenced 



394 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP.EOIA. 

by it. A large proportion of the soils of Great Britain ai'e thus INDIGENOUS 
or SEDENTARY, and rest upon the parent rock. Hence an important connec- 
tion is at once evident between the geology and the agriculture of that 
country. The student is able to a certain extent to predicate the general 
character of a soil when he knows the main geological features of the 
district. 

On the other hand, we cannot fail to observe that over large tracts the 
surface soil does not present any similarity of appearance or character 
when compared with the underlying rock. Here the surface soil has been 
TRANSPORTED from a distance. Sometimes it is superior in quality to 
what we might have expected, and in that case it is probably alluvial mat- 
ter deposited by some river in its course or at its estuary ; and there are- 
cases in which the river that deposited those fertile plains has long ceased 
to flow. Or we may be standing upon an old lava field which covers 
and renders fertile an area that would otherwise have been comparatively 
barren. 

At other times the soil is of lower quality than we thought to find, and 
in such cases its poverty may be due to the growth of peat or the accu- 
mulation of " drift." " Drifted " material masks, or covers, many localities 
in Ontario and other countries, giving a poorer soil than the underlying 
and masked rock would have yielded. 

There are then two great classes of soils, the first bsaring the stamp of 
its origin, and exhibiting a close relationship to the underlying rock, from 
which, indeed, it was formed. In studying these soils, the main geologi- 
cal features of the country are exceedingly useful guides. 

The second class comprises all alluvial, drifted, lava, and peaty soils, 
which, having been deposited, spread, or, in the last case, produced upon 
the spot at a later period, do not exhibit any correspondence with the 
main geological features of the district in which they occur. In these, 
minute geological study is requisite if we wish to trace their origin. 



3. DISTRIBUTION OF SOILS. 






The bearings of geology upon agriculture are abundantly illustrated in 
the distribution of soils. It would be irrelevant to our subject to enter 
into the geological aspect of this subject at great length. The student 
who wishes to do so will find it necessary to study geology. It will, how- 
ever, greatly assist him to grasp the plan of soil distribution if he keeps 
in memory the order of succession of the main beds or formations which 
constitute the explored crust of the earth. 



THK SOIL OF THE FARM. 393 

The importance of this fact to the agriculturist is at once apparent, 
when we find that each strut nm in turn occupies the surfaceofthe con. it- 
try. It is the constant order of succession which makes the arrangement 
of the various formations of practical use to the land- valuer or the agri- 
culturist. 

Some geological formations yield soils of high average fertility, while 
others yield inferior soils. Some are stiff and expensive to work, while 
others are generally free working. It must, however, be remembered that 
geological knowledge, although useful, is not entirely to be relied upon. 
On all formations, good, bad, and indifferent soils are no doubt to be met 
with. The mingling of formations together at their edges, accumulation 
of drifted matter, the occurrence of less important strata, unnoticed per- 
haps in the geological chart, and other reasons, create numerous excep- 
tions to any rule which ma)- be laid down with respect to the soils of a 
certain geological formation. The subject is full of interest, and deserves 
a longer notice than we can at present afford it. 

4>. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SOILS, AND SURROUNDING CONDITIONS. 

THE PROXIMATE CONSTITUENTS OF SOILS. Soils differ widely from each 
other in their physical properties. Some are wet and consequently cold ; 
others are warm and dry ; some are easily worked, while others are 
exceedingly tough ; some are easily burnt up by drought, while others 
maintain a thriving herbage through the most trying seasons. The phy- 
sical nature of a soil depends upon the proportion in which its proximate 
constituents are blended. All soils are composed of five proximate ingre- 
dients ; namely : (1) Sand, (2) Clay, (3) Lime, (4) Vegetable matter, (5) 
Mineral fragments (stones). Whether derived from the decay of chalk or 
sandstone, it will be found that all fertile soils are thus constituted, and 
the kind and quality of the soil depends to a great extent upon the pro- 
portion in which these materials are mixed together. A short account of 
these familiar substances becomes therefore very necessary if we are to 
arrive at a sound conclusion regarding the nature of soils. 

SAND may be either calcareous, micaceous, or silicious. A calcareous 
sand simply means a sand in which particles of lime, it may be shells or 
chalk, abound. Many sea sands are of this nature and may be applied to 
land as a source of lime. Pure sand is, however, free from lime, and con- 
sists almost exclusively of small grains of silicic acid (quartz). It is seen 
in its purest form as silver sand, and is accumulated in quantities wher- 
ever it is separated from earthy matter by the action of water. It is 



396 THE HOME, FAIIM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 






insoluble in water and acids, and fuses into a vitreous mass when sub- 
jected to a white heat. 

Sand quickly dries, and possesses no power to absorb moisture from a 
damp atmosphere. A cubic foot of sand has been found able to hold 27 
Ibs. of water as a sponge, i.e., without dripping. Its retentive power to- 
wards heat renders it useful in the chemical laboratory as a " sand bath," 
when it is required to keep up a uniform dry heat. Its insoluble, intract- 
able and simple or elementary characters render it unfit to support plant 
life. It cannot be said to be in any sense a plant food, but it acts as a 
divider or opener of the land. It facilitates the percolation of water 
through the soil ; renders the passage of roots in search of food more 
easy ; confers a degree of warmth on soils first by drying them, and 
secondly from its inherent power of retaining warmth ; and renders the 
oil easy of tillage. All soils contain sand, and its greater or less predom- 
inance is used as a means of classifying them. 

CLAY. The purest forms are china or porcelain and pipe clays. In the 
first forms it is found in vast quantities, and becomes the basis of the 
manufacture of the finest white wares. It is plastic in its character, and 
to this property it owes its value as a material for making bricks and 
pottery. The minute particles which form clay have been observed to be 
crystalline in structure. 

When dry it may be reduced to an impalpable powder. When moist- 
ened it emits the characteristic argillaceous odour, and becomes highly 
plastic. When subjected to a low red heat it loses its plasticity, and be- 
comes permanently hard and brittle a fact of great importance not only 
in the arts but in agriculture. Clay is naturally colder than sand. In 
chemical language clay is hydrated aluminium silicate, but in nature it 
is almost invariably associated with potash, soda, lime, ferric oxide, mag- 
nesia, and carbon dioxide. 

These impurities render clay much more valuable as a constituent of 
soils than if it were pure. It is in consequence of their presence that a 
clay soil is very often rich, and that clay ranks among the most import- 
ant constituents of soils. Pure clay would be as little able to support 
vegetation as pure sand, but when associated with sand, native or impure 
clay yields a fertile soil. The special functions it performs in a soil are, 
first, the maintenance of fertility by the introduction of valuable mineral 
food constituents ; secondly, clay gives " body " to a soil, by which is 
meant a certain consistency favourable to the retention of moisture ; and 
coolness which enables a soil to resist drought. 



THE SOIL OF THK KARM. 397 

LIME is widely distributed, and occurs in vast quantities. The chalk- 
hills which sweep through England are almost pure lime. The Lower 
Oolite consists largely of lime, and the magnesian and mountain lime- 
stones occupy large areas of several counties. Lime is also found in the 
form of marls and marbles in many other geological formations, so that it 
is available for agricultural purposes in nearly all localities. It is em- 
ployed as a manure in the forms of chalk, marl, and burnt lime, and its- 
application and uses will occupy us when we consider the subject of man- 
ures. At present it appears before us as a constituent part of all fertile- 
soils, and its wide distribution is illustrated by the fact that it invariably 
occurs in such soils in greater or less proportions. Although spoken of 
as " lime " by the farmer, it is more correctly described as calcium car- 
bonate (carbonate of lime). The carbon dioxide is readily displaced, and 
flies off witli brisk effervesence when any stronger acid is applied. Pure 
calcium carbonate is found in nature in the forms of Iceland spar, white 
marble, and chalk. When exposed to a red heat it parts with its carbon 
dioxide and water, and when cool it is found to be porous in texture, and 
to exhibit an avidity for moisture and carbon dioxide, which renders it 
caustic. It reabsorbs the water, and to a limited extent the carbon diox- 
ide from the atmosphere, and as it does so " slakes " or " falls " into a mild 
powdery mass. If water is poured over the calcined lime, the slaking in 
more rapid, and accompanied by the evolution of much sensible heat. The 
characteristic colour of lime is white that of the Magnesian, sucli as that 
at Guelph, Ontario, having a yellow tinge. It is intermediate between 
sand and clay in tenacity and in its power of holding water. 

Lime is an important constituent of all fertile soils. It is in itself a 
plant food, and a valuable manure. It exerts a strong effect upon decay- 
ing vegetable matter by accelerating its resolution into carbon dioxide, 
ammonia, and water ; it also combines with vegetable acids, and forms 
with them neutral lime-salts, no longer injurious to vegetation. It plays 
an important part towards the mineral matter of the soil, by decomposing 
the silicates and setting free their alkalies. Lime acts mechanically by 
improving the texture of clay soils, and being of intermediate tenacity, it 
is also able to confer a higher degree of consistency upon light soils. Like 
clay, lime owes its agricultural value in a great degree to its impurities. 
Magnesian limestone, as its name implies, contains from 36 to 40 per 
cent, of magnesium carbonate, and about, or above, 50 per cent, of calcium 
carbonate. The limestones which form the Chalk, and the formations of 
mountain and oolitic limestones, are chiefly composed of the latter salt ; 
but associated with it there occur ferric oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, cal- 



39S THE KOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 






cium sulphate, silicia, water, and a trace of organic matter. Thus clay 
and native limestone will be seen to contain most of the elementary sub- 
stances which enter into the composition of the ash of plants. 

VEGETABLE MATTER has accumulated in all cultivated soils, and in the 
form of peat it sometimes composes the entire mass. It is to the pre- 
sence of humus or vegetable matter that the rich brown colour of good 
land is due, It may be described as a dark-brown, soft, porous, sub- 
stance, seen in the greatest purity in the form of well-rotted wood or leaf- 
mould. It is constantly in a state of decay or slow combustion, which is 
never completely arrested until it is reduced to the condition of pure car- 
bon. The earlier agricultural chemists attributed a greater importance 
to this constituent of soils than is at present assigned to it. It was ob- 
served that all garden soils and fertile loams were rich in vegetation mat- 
ter, and the inference was drawn that it was the cause of fertility. The 
late Baron Liebig, in his work on Agricultural Chemistry, published in 1840, 
demolished this theory by showing that humus was not the cause, but 
rather an inevitable consequence of richness. A rich soil, suitable for the 
growth of plants, cannot fail to accumulate vegetable matter by the fall 
of the leaf and the death of root fibres. A soil may be rich without hu- 
mus, as is proved by the fertility of lava soils. The more a soil produces, 
the greater will be its stock of humus, as for example, in the case of a 
crop of mangel or swedes, or in the case of a hay or straw crop, the accu- 
mulation of roots in the soil leaves it positively richer in humus than it 
originally was, in spite of the many tons per acre of produce removed in 
the root crops. Land adapted for the growth of timber will yield many 
tons per acre of wood in the course of years, and yet the soil will be posi- 
tively better stored with organic matter or humus at the end of the period 
than it was at the commencement. This can only be explained on the 
ground that the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, which constitute humus, 
are derived from the air and not from the soil. Although useful, it is 
therefore seen to be less essential than any of the proximate constituents 
yet noticed. 

Humus is not assimilated directly by flowering plants. It is valuable 
as a perpetual source of carbon dioxide, and in a less degree as a source of 
nitrogen. The gradual decay of humus maintains the interstitial atmos- 
phere, rich in carbon dioxide, and impregnates the rain which penetrates 
the soil with the same ingredient. It is in this manner that humus be- 
comes useful in the nutrition of plants, and at the same time assists in 
that slow digestion which liberates insoluble matter from the soil, and 
renders it fit for the use of the plant. Humus is also highly valuable in 



THE SOIL OF THE FAK.M.

modifying the texture of land. Without it a soil would be li"-ht in colour 
powdery, dry, and harsh to the touch. With it it becomes brown in colour, 
cool, moist, and mellow, and in every way better fitted for the growth of 
plants. 

MINERAL FRAGMENTS (STONES). Although stones might at first sight 
appear rather as intruders than as legitimate constituents of a soil, their 
constant occurrence and important uses lead us to consider them in the 
latter light. Their precise nature will depend upon the origin of the soil. 
Thus in an alluvial deposit or drifted soil we expect to find water-worn 
round pebbles ; in an oolitic limestone, irregular fragments ploughed up 
from the rock beneath, and in a chalk soil we expect to find flints. They 
always modify the character of land when they occur in lar^e numbers. 
Many soils now worked as light land would be unworkable clays were 
they not lightened up and divided by countless stones. It is also im- 
portant to bear in mind that stones 'may be regarded as undecayed frac- 
ments of the original rock from which the soil itself was derived. They 
are of all sizes, down to minute chips and particles, and especially must 
these smaller particles yield up fresh mineral food for plants under the in- 
fluences of frost, warmth, and moisture. A time must come in which even 
the largest will crumble down, and hence we may regard the mineral 
fragments as a magazine of mineral plant food. 

A soil is then no mere mass of powdered rock, but a complex substance, 
the product of various forces, acting through long cycles, and modified by 
the growth of plants, and the decay of both vegetable and animal matter. 
Soils may be spoken of as the graveyard of countless generations of ani- 
mated nature ; as stocked with plant food at once available, and fortified 
with further as yet unprepared material, forthcoming when required. 

In the language of a respected authority, it may be spoken of as a labo- 
ratory, in which beneficial changes are ever taking place, a vehicle by 
which plant food finds its way to the root fibres of growing vegetation, 
and a storehouse of present and future plant food. 

The physical properties of soils will be modified according to the propor- 
tions in which sand, clay, lime, vegetable matters, and mineral fragments 
enter into their composition. 

In order to possess fertility in the highest degree, a soil must afford easy 
access and egress to superfluous water, but at the same time must possess 
sufficient retentive power to guard against protracted drought ; its texture 
must be at once firm and yielding, so as to afford protection to root fibres, 
while it allows of their free passage in search of nutriment; it should be 



400 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

well stocked with available plant food ; and so situated with reference to 
subsoil and climate as to insure the realization of the above good qualities. 

POROSITY. A fertile soil must be porous, i.e., the particles which com- 
pose it must not be too near together, but allow room for an interstitial 
atmosphere, the free percolation and retention of water, and for the con- 
densation of valuable fertilising matters upon the interstitial surfaces. 

The porosity of soils is an exceedingly interesting subject. It occupied 
the attention of Jethro Tull early in the last century, and it afforded a 
fertile theme for investigation to the late Sir H. Thompson, of Kirby, and 
subsequently to the late Baron Liebig, Professors Way and Voelcker, Sir 
J. B. Lawes, and other chemists. The porosity of a soil may be measured 
by the fineness of its particles. A coarse-grained sand, although more 
open in its texture, is in reality less porous than a finely grained clay. It 
has fewer pores. Every time we break a fragment of any substance we 
increase the extent of its superficies, and this is practically true ad infini- 
tum; so that an impalpable powder presents the largest possible surface, 
and is in a condition of maximum porosity. Our most porous soils are 
therefore our clays, a statement that is capable of satisfactory demonstra- 
tion, although the use of the word in this connection would scarcely be 
accepted by agriculturists, who speak of sands as porous, in opposition to 
clays, which are spoken of as retentive soils. 

The porosity of soils explains some of their most interesting physical 
functions. It is owing to this property that they are able to retain suffi- 
cient moisture for the use of growing vegetables. It is also owing to the 
same property, assisted by others, that soils are able to appropriate and 
hold certain valuable fertilizing matters with sufficient strength to over- 
come the tendency of the rainfall to wash them beyond the reach of 
plants. That these important functions are possessed in the highest de- 
gree by clay soils, is sufficient proof that these soils possess the highest 
degree of porosity. 

CAPILLARITY. This property also depends upon porosity. It is observ- 
able that when a fluid is admitted between very closely contiguous sur- 
faces, such as two plates of glass held almost touching, and dipped into 
water, the fluid will be seen to rise between the plates to a considerably 
higher level than its own. Lump-sugar and blotting-paper dipped into 
water are familiar examples of the same force ; and a lump of clay, if im- 
mersed in a saucer of water, will become wet to its summit from the same 
cause. The finer the interstitial spaces, the higher wiH the fluid ascend ; 
and hence we find that a column of finely-powdered clay will become wet 
thirty-six inches above the surface of the water into which its base is 



THE SOIL OF THE FARM. 401 

dipped. Sand very quickly causes water to rise, but not higher than 
about twenty to twenty-three inches. Loamy soils will lift water by ca- 
pillary attraction thirty-five or thirty-six inches ; and lastly, clay broken 
into fragments as large as split-peas, only raises water 5.7, 9.5, and 12 
inches high. 

Capillarity is constantly exerted by soils, and the fact that it is con- 
tinued from the deeper layers towards the surface during frost, accounts 
for the plash y condition of paths and roads when the thaw sets in. This 
subject will once more occupy us when we consider land drainage. 

INFLUENCE OF POROSITY UPON FERTILITY. The influence of porosity 
upon the fertility of soils has already been alluded to. It has been long 
known that soil possesses strong deodorising power, and it can easily be 
shown to decolourise solutions and to transmit a colourless and odourless 
filtrate. Liquid manure, when filtered through a certain depth of earth, 
becomes thoroughly purified. It is this property of soil which makes it 
available for the purification of sewage, and in this case it is assisted by 
the oxidising influence of the air. After running over and through a suf- 
ficient area and section of land, sewage will be found to be perfectly 
colourless, and to have lost its offensive odour. 

Further, it lias been demonstrated by Professor Way and others, that 
watery solutions of ammonia, potash, salts and soluble phosphates, when 
filtered through ordinary soils, are robbed of almost the whole of these 
substances. They are held back by the soil in a state of physical or phy- 
sico-chemical combination ; and although capable of being once more par- 
tially detached by the copious use of pure water, they are to a great ex- 
tent permanently retained by the soil. 

Thus the three most important fertilizers are found to be specially at- 
tracted to and held by the soil, a fact which bears upon the best means 
of applying such substances to the land. 

This peculiar power seems to be due to a somewhat obscure adhesive 
force. It has been compared to the decolourising action of animal char- 
coal upon sugar, and also to the curious manifestation of adhesion or sur- 
face-attraction seen in dyeing. In this process particles of colouring mat- 
ter are removed from solution or suspension, and become firmlv fixed to 
the fabric, a common but not easily explainable phenomenon. In some 
such way the soil seems to remove colouring matter, smell, and even salts 
in solution from water, and to fix them in its pores or interstices. 

It is also now certain that, as the forces already noticed detach fresh 
particles in a soluble form from the intractable and insoluble mass of the 
soil, that these particles will be fixed at once by the surface-attraction 
z

under consideration, and held safely for the use of plants. Thus avail- 
able plant food accumulates in a fallow field or permanent pasture, and 
the ground becomes richer by rest. 

ACTIVE AND DORMANT CONSTITUENTS OF SOILS. The preceding section 
will have shown that in every soil the material from which the tissues of 
plants may eventually be elaborated, exists in two physical conditions. 
First, there is the mass of earthy matter which has already been seen to 
consist of sand, clay, lime, vegetable matter, and stones ; with the excep- 
tion of lime none of these substances are taken up by the roots of plants. 
But associated with them in much smaller quantities are a number of 
substances which constitute the active ingredients of a soil. Of these last 
a small portion is already soluble and available, and a larger quantity is 
insoluble, and therefore for the present unavailable. 

The mass of soil may be regarded as the hunting-ground in which the 
roots of plants ramify and search for food ; also as a suitable material for 
preserving proper conditions relating to moisture and to temperature. It 
is indispensable to the well-being of the plant, but at the same time it is 
not the general mass of the soil which feeds it. The entire mass may be 
thus divided : First, the part comprising potential, or possible (future), 
plant food as yet insoluble in water and in acids. The second, the por- 
tion soluble in water, or dilute acid, representing the active or available 
plant food of the soil. 

What then is the nature of these changes which are for ever taking 

place in a soil ? 

By the removal of crops the available plant food becomes exhausted, 
and the field ceases to be productive. But after a few years of rest fer- 
tility is found to be restored. During the interval of rest the soil has 
been exposed to changes of temperature, to the action of air and moisture, 
and it may be to vegetative force in the action of roots of plants which 
have taken possession of the surface. The consequence is, that under the 
combined influences of these forces, fragments of quartz, felspar, apatite, 
phosphorite, gypsum, and other mineral substances, become " weathered." 
They part with small quantities of their substance, which pass over into 
the soluble and available condition, arid thus a store of plant food once 
more accumulates. 

This mineral matter rendered soluble will not be suffered 
through the staple of the soil, but will be only carried a very short dis- 
tance before it is seized upon and appropriated by that singular force of 
surface-attraction already noticed ; and hence we see a satisfactory rea- 



THE SOIL OF THE FARM. 

son why " rest " restores land, and a clear difference between the active 
and the as yet dormant constituents of a soil. 

TENACITY. A degree of tenacity is essential to a soil. Where it does 
not exist in sufficient strength, the entire mass is liable to be gradually 
blown away. On the other hand, too great a tenacity causes a soil to be 
expensive and critical to cultivate, and unfits it for the growth of turnips, 
mangel, and other crops suitable for the winter feeding of stock. The' 
tenacity of a soil is due to the presence of clay. 

SLOPE OR INCLINATION. The slope of land is well known to influence 
its productive power, and that in more than one way. Slope to a great 
extent controls the drainage of water, and this alone must be allowed to 
be of first importance. It also admits of a greater or less intensity of 
light and heat upon a'given area of the surface. 

It is from this cause that the north side of valleys, or those which enjoy 
a sunny or southern slope, are the most productive. It is upon such slopes 
that the finest wine is grown. 

COLOUR. Even colour influences the fertility of a soil, although to only 
a slight degree. A white soil, like white cloth, snow, or any other white 
substance, throws off the heat. On the other hand, dark-coloured sub- 
stances absorb it. 

A familiar illustration of this is seen in the fact that snow immediately 
underlying a piece of black cloth soon melts, while the surroundin^ 
snow, protected by its own whiteness, remains unaffected at the same 
temperature. 

SUBSOIL. A soil may be well stocked with plant food, and be of good 
physical character, but before it can be productive it must be provided 
with a proper subsoil. The reason of this is obvious, for upon the subsoil 
depends the drainage of the surface soil. A tenacious clay subsoil is by 
no means to be considered bad, but it will generally require to be thor- 
oughly drained by artificial means before the superficial soil can grow 
abundant crops. A light sandy or gravelly subsoil secures the natural 
drainage of the surface, but is likely to cause it to burn or scorch in 
droughty weather. The effect of a rocky subsoil upon the cultivated sur- 
face depends upon the nature of the rock. A fissured dry rock like chalk 
is apt to give too dry a soil, while a cool porous stone, like that of the 
Old or New Red Sandstone, exerts an opposite effect. A rocky subsoil 
argues a thin soil and a low standard of fertility. 

The term subsoil may be used to express the stratum which underlies 
the superficial earthy covering, irrespective of its depth beneath the sur- 
face, and in this case we might speak of a soil six feet thick underlaid by 



404 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

a subsoil of rock or clay. It is preferred at present to limit the term soil 
to the cultivated section. Subsoil is then made to express the section or 
zone which immediately underlies the plough-sole. By this use of 
the word, the term subsoil harmonises with the operation of subsoiling, 
which always refers to the breaking up of the section immediately under 
that usually cultivated. 

CALCAREOUS PAN. Cases are on record in which, after a long period c 
shallow cultivation, a lime, or calcareous pan is formed. It is well known 
that lime tends to sink through the land, and this tendency is most likely 
to be favoured by shallow cultivation. When a lime pan has formed, it 
must be broken up and mixed with the surface soil, which will in all 
cases be greatly benefited, while the drainage of the field will be rend- 
ered more perfect. 

INDURATED PAN. The constant treading of horses and the passa 
the plough-sole at one depth gradually indurates the bottom of the furrow 
to a mischievous extent, and forms a hard, beaten track, or pan, besi 
removed by the adoption of deep cultivation, either by means of i 

horses. . 

Good cultivation is found to react upon the subsoil, and improve 
texture and physical character. Thus liberal manuring, thorough dram- 
aJe and deep ploughing allow the access of air, and effect the pulverisation 
and aeration of the subsoil. It changes in colour from a blue or black 
to a red from the same cause as converts the dark venous blood into 
bright arterial stream-the action of oxygen upon iron. This is follows 
by "a true sweetening of the subsoil, caused by the complete decay of eff 
vegetable matter, and when this has taken place, the roots of plants 
deeper into the subsoil, and the consequence is a deepening of the staple 
and an improvement of the subsoil to a depth of several feet. 

SUBSOILS WHICH EXERT A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE SURFACE SOIL. 
-In alluvial soils, and where from any cause the subsoil is of simiU 
character with the cultivated surface soil, deep tillage produces excellent 
results To break up or disturb the subsoil is not by any means an ope] 
ation to be promiscuously recommended, but in this case it may 1 
lowed without hesitation. 

A liaht- topped soil, resting upon a retentive substratum, is on the whole 
to be considered a happy combination, although artificial drainage may 
be required to facilitate the percolation of water. In some cases 
or marly subsoil may be dug up and spread upon the surface with go 
effect A clay resting upon sand or gravel, if not of too open a character, 



THE SOIL OF THE FARM. 405 

is a good combination, as such soils are naturally drained. Here also 
mixing the surface soil and subsoil may be attended with good effects. 

SUBSOILS WHICH EXERT AN INJURIOUS EFFECT ox THE SURFACE SOIL. 
All "pans" from whatever cause are injurious and require to be 
broken up. Open gravelly, or rubbly subsoils are apt to allow fertiliz- 
ing matter applied to the land to work through beyond the reach of 
the roots of plants. They are also liable to suffer from drought in hot 
seasons. Such land should never be manured in the autumn, but as 
much as possible during the period of active vegetation. 

A rocky subsoil is usually objectionable, as preventing deep cultivation, 
and facilitating the escape of moisture too rapidly. Soils resting on the 
rock seldom carry heavy crops, but they are well adapted for sheep, and 
are usually farmed with a view to folding sheep in winter in temperate 
climates, and for growing barley. 

5. CLASSIFICATION OF SOILS. 

Sinking for a time the important consideration of chemical composition, 
the relative fertility of soils is largely due to the proportion in which the 
already described proximate constituents are combined. It is upon this 
principle that agriculturists classify soils, speaking of them as argillace- 
ous, silicious, calcareous, or vegetable, according to the predominance of 
one or other of these substances. 

The following classification was proposed nearly forty years ago by 
Schubler, and may be adopted as giving a method of distinguishing the 
various kinds of land. The terms usually employed by farmers in de- 
scribing different soils are numerous, but unfortunately either local in 
their significance, or the same term is made to convey a very different 
meaning in districts remote from each other. 

Schubler followed the method adopted by naturalists in dividing soils 
into classes, orders, species, and varieties. He recognised eight classes, 
based upon the predominating element of each. 

FIRST, the argillaceous or clay group, containing always above 50 per 
cent, of clay real or so called, for chemically pure clay has since been 
found to be much less, than by this chemist. 

This class he divided into clays without lime, and clays with from - 5 
to 5 per cent, of lime ; and these were again divided into poor, inter- 
mediate, and rich. Hence there were no fewer than six sorts of argilla- 
ceous soils : Poor, intermediate, and rich, with but little or no lime, and 
poor, intermediate, and rich, with a higher percentage of lime. 



406 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

The SECOND CLASS is called " LOAMY SOILS," and contains from 30 to 
50 per cent, of clay. Similarly these are divided into loams containing 
little or no lime, and those containing from '5 to 5 per cent, of lime, 
which again are each divided into poor, intermediate, and rich, making 
six sorts of loamy soils. 

The THIRD CLASS is composed of SANDY LOAMS, containing from 20 to 
30 per cent, of clay, and is divided into sandy loams with little or no 
lime, and sandy loams with from - 5 to 5 per cent, of that constituent. 
Here, as in the former classes, poor, intermediate, and rich soils are re- 
cognised with and without lime. 

The FOURTH CLASS, designated LOAMY SANDS, contains from" 10 to 20 
per cent, of clay, and is divided into six species exactly on the principle 
jflst explained. 

The FIFTH CLASS or SANDY SOILS contains under 10 per cent, of clay, 
and is also divided as above. 

The SIXTH CLASS comprises all the marly soils. This term is only ap- 
plied to soils which contain more than 5 but less than 20 per cent, of lime. 
Marls may be either argillaceous, loamy, of the nature of sandy loams, 
loamy sands, or of vegetable character, according as they coincide in their 
proportions of clay and sands with the previous groups. Thus an argil- 
laceous marl must have over 50 per cent, of clay, and from 5 to 20 per 
cent, of lime ; and a loamy marl must contain 20 to 30 per cent, of clay, 
besides the requisite amount of lime. 

The SEVENTH CLASS is termed CALCAREOUS, and contains above 20 per 
cent, of lime. This class again is divided into argillaceous, loamy, of the 
nature of sandy loam, loamy sand, or of vegetable character, as in the last 
case, and each of them is again divided into poor, intermediate, and rich. 

In this class, therefore we find poor, calcareous clays, poor calcareous 
loams, and poor calcareous sands, or it may be intermediate or rich soils 
of each kind. 

There are also pure calcareous soils, containing 94 to 98 per cent, of 
lime, and vegetable calcareous soils, divided into clayey, loamy, and 
sandy. 

The EIGHTH and LAST CLASS deals with vegetable soils, or those which 
contain from 5 per cent, and upwards of humus, which are treated of as 
clayey, loamy, or sandy vegetable soils, according to the predominance of 
each of these elements. They are further divided according to the condi- 
tion of the vegetable matter which renders this class highly complicated. 

Reference has been made to the division in each case into poor, inter- 
mediate, and rich. The test as to comparative richness was uniform

throughout, and consisted in the proportion of vegetable matter. A poor 
soil of any class was a soil which contained from to '5 of vegetable mat- 
ter ; an intermediate soil must contain from '5 to 1*5 of vegetable matter ; 
and a rich soil must have from 1'5 to 5 per cent, of the same. Any pro- 
portion of humus exceeding 5 per cent., caused a transference of the soil 
into the class of humus or vegetable moulds.

studying the actual composition of soils, it must be remem- 
bered that the subject has a distinctly mechanical, or phy- 
sical, as well as a chemical aspect. Chemical analysis 
teaches us the proportion in which the various constituents 
composing it are present. But how little light does this 
throw upon the agricultural character of a soil ! We must 
know something of the texture, and the many important 
surrounding conditions already enumerated, as well as the 
ultimate composition ; and hence inspection and a mechani- 
cal analysis should precede the more elaborate processes of the labora- 
tory. The proportion of stones, gravel, gravelly sand, coarse sand, fine 
sand, clay, organic matter, and moisture, are ascertained by simple, but 
well-contrived, 'means. To thoroughly understand the texture or me- 
chanical nature of soils, their relations to heat and water must be taken 
into account, and when this has been done, the purely chemical analysis is 
rendered much more useful. 

The chemical composition of the principal minerals composing the cry- 
stalline rocks will naturally be found in all sedimentary rocks, although 
in widely differing proportions ; and they will also be found to occur in 
all soils. The precise composition can only be discovered by analysis, but 
we may always infer that the leading constituent of a soil will be the same 
as that which gave character to the rock from which it was derived. Thus 
the silicious element will predominate in sandstone soils, the calcareous in 
chalks and limestones, and the argillaceous in soils derived from the great 
clay formations. 



408 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

The only material of importance to be added to the list of constituents 
already referred to is organic matter, which is present in all soils as the 
result of the growth and death of plants. It is through the accumulation 
of vegetable matter in soils that they become rich in nitrogen in a state of 
combination available as plant food. But it must be remembered that the 
air is the ultimate source from which soils have derived their organic mat- 
ter and nitrogen, and the process of slow combustion known as decay, 
steadily returns these materials back again to the air, or converts them 
into water and nitric acid. 

A broad distinction is therefore drawn between the fixed or " inorganic " 
constituents of soils, and the organic substances which are in a perpetual 
state of change. Leaving the further consideration of humus, we must 
direct our attention to the mineral constituents of soils, which are also the 
constituents of the ash of plants. 

The following substances occur in all soils, and in the ashes of all cul- 
tivated plants, and are also found to exist in the crystalline rocks.

Fluorine and manganese are also found to occur in many soils, in very

The fertility of a soil must depend, among other things, upon the pre- 
sence of every constituent required by plants, and so completely is this the 
case that the absence of even, what might appear, the least important sub- 
stance, renders a soil unable to ripen crops. 

In the above list those constituents which occur in least quantities in 
the soil are generally those which the ash contains in largest proportion, 
and are therefore most required by plants, and it is for this reason that 
potash and phosphorus pentoxide are highly valued as applications for 
land. 

The constituents of soils occur in various conditions. It is not enough 
to know that a soil contains all the requisite materials for supplying ash 



THE CHEMISTRY OF THE FARM. 409 

constituents to plants, but we must know the state in which they exist. 
Hence a complete analysis of a soil should inform us as to the proportion 
of substances soluble in water, soluble in acids, and insoluble in "</'</.-. A 
soil, from which all pebbles and considerable fragments have been sifted, 
should be insoluble in acids, and therefore unavailable for present use, 
is itself a striking fact. Equally strange does it appear that - 1 to -3 per 
cent, should represent the amount we may suppose to be readily available 
for solution. But although the percentage is small relatively, it is very 
considerable positively, amounting to from one to three tons per acre of 
ten inches in depth. 

The insoluble portion of soils must not be looked upon as useless. Not 
only is it the medium by which nourishment finds its way to the roots of 
plants, but owing to the continued action of the forces already noticed, a 
further disintegration is constantly taking place a weathering action 
whereb}' fresh portions or particles of insoluble matter pass over into a 
soluble and available condition. The entire mass of soil may then be 
divided into ACTIVE and DORMANT constituents, the former class being 
constantly, although slowly, recruited from the latter. A soil which has 
borne successive crops of grain becomes exhausted of the active or imme- 
diately available ash constituents. A field exhausted in this sense, if 
allowed a period of rest, will be found to have regained its fertility, simply 
because fresh portions of mineral matter have been digested and reduced 
to a soluble condition. These considerations, therefore, show clearly that 
the large proportion of material in a soil, insoluble in acids, may be re- 
garded as a magazine of mineral plant food, which will become available 
in the distant future. 

The actual percentage composition of the soil is shown in the following 
analyses made by various eminent chemists. It is but seldom that a 
thorough analysis is made of all the divisions, soluble in water, soluble 
in acids, and insoluble in acids. In the following examples the insoluble 
matter is lumped together as insoluble silicious matter. The table shows 
the composition of a fertile alluvial soil from near the Zuider Zee, in Hol- 
land, analysed by Baumhauer.

The proportion of plant food present in soils is very small, even when 
the soil is extremely fertile. The surface soil (first 9 inches) of a pasture 
may contain when dry 0'25 of nitrogen per cent., while soil of the same 
depth from a good arable field may yield 0'15 per cent., and a clay sub- 
soil 0'05 per cent. A good surface soil may contain 0'20 per cent, of 
phosphate acid, or not unfrequently a smaller quantity. Potash varies 
much, rising to TO per cent., or more in some clay soils, but being gene- 
rally much smaller. 

The weight of soil on an acre of land is, however, so enormous, that 
small proportions of plant food may amount to very considerable quanti- 
ties. Nine inches' depth of arable soil (clay or loam) will weigh, when 
perfectly dry, about 3,000,000 or 3,500,000 Ibs. A pasture soil will be 
lighter, the first nine inches weighing when dried and the roots removed 
about 2,250,000 Ibs. Supposing, therefore, a dry soil to contain O'lO per 
cent, of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, or potash, the quantity in nine inches 
of soil will be from 2250 Ibs. to 3500 Ibs. per acre. 

A large part of the elements of plant food contained in soils is present 
in such a condition that plants are unable to make use of it. A soil may 
contain many thousand pounds of phosphoric acid or of nitrogen, and yet 



THE CHEMISTRY OF THE FARM. 41 1 

be in a poor condition ; while a small dressing of readily available food, 
as superphosphate or nitrate or sodium, may greatly increase the fertility. 

The nitrogen contained in humus is not in a condition to serve as a 
general plant food ; cereal crops are apparently unable to appropriate it ; 
leguminous crops, however, possibly assimilate some humic matters. By 
the action of a minute Bacterium present in all soils, humus and ammo- 
nia are oxidised, and their nitrogen converted into nitric acid. Nitrifica- 
tion only takes place in moist soil, sufficiently porous to admit air. It is 
also necessary that some base should be present with which the nitric 
acid may combine : this condition is usually fulfilled by the presence of 
carbonate of calcium. Nitrification is most active at summer tempera- 
tures ; it ceases apparently near the freezing point. 

The fragments of rock present in soil, as stones, gravel, and sand, are 
as a rule of little value to a plant, the elements of plant food which they 
contain being in too insoluble a condition to be attacked by the roots. 
These fragments of rock may however be slowly decomposed by the 
mechanical action of frost, and by the chemical action of water, and their 
contents thus gradually made available to the plant. The solvent power 
of the water in a soil is greatly increased by the carbonic acid, and per- 
haps also by the humic acid it holds in solution. Water containing car- 
bonate of calcium in solution is especially capable of attacking silicates. 

If water is allowed to drain through a soil it carries with it a part of 
the readily soluble matter which a soil contains. The substances chiefly 
removed by the water will be the nitrates, chlorides, and sulphates of cal- 
cium and sodium. When heavy rain falls these substances are washed 
into the subsoil, and partly escape by the nearest outfall into the springs, 
brooks, and rivers. The loss of nitrates from highly manured land during 
a wet season is very considerable. When dry weather sets in evaporation 
takes place at the surface of the soil, the water of the subsoil is slowly 
brought again to the surface by capillary attraction, and the salts it con- 
tains are concentrated once more in the upper soil, forming in some rare 
instances a white crust of salt upon the surface. Capillary attraction has 
little influence in the case of sandy soils. 

Of these readily soluble salts the nitrates are of the greatest importance 
as plant food. The quantity of nitrates in a surface soil will vary greatly, 
depending on the richness of the soil in nitrogen, the previous conditions 
as to temperature and moisture, the extent of recent washing by rain, and 
on whether the soil is or is not under crop. Where a crop is growing the 
nitrates will be kept nearer the surface, the evaporation of water from a 
growing crop being far greater than from a bare soil. The nitrates will 



412 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

also be constantly taken up by the roots, and employed as plant food. 
The loss of nitrates by drainage is thus far less when the land is under 
crop than in the case of a bare fallow. 

Phosphoric acid, potash, and ammonia are very rarely found in drain- 
age water. If a solution containing phosphoric acid, potash, or ammonia 
is poured on a sufficiently large quantity of fertile soil, the water which 
filters through will be found destitute of these substances. This retentive 
power of soil for phosphoric acid, potash, <fec., is of the utmost importance 
in agriculture. The action is a complex one. All salts are doubtless re- 
tained to some extent by soil through mere mechanical adhesion ; salts, 
thus feebly retained, as nitrates and chlorides, can be easily removed by 
washing with water. Other substances are, on the contrary, retained by 
chemical affinity ; these are not removed by washing, or but to a small 
extent. The ingredients of the soil which exercise a chemical retention 
power are the hydrates of ferric oxide and aluminia, the hydrous silicates 
of aluminium, and humus. 

Ferric oxide is a common ingredient of soils ; to it the red colour of 
many soils is owing. To the presence of ferric oxide the retention of 
phosphoric acid is chiefly due, an insoluble basic phosphate of iron being 
produced. Aluminia acts in the same manner. Ferric oxide and aluminia 
have also a retentive power for ammonia and potash, but the compounds 
formed are more or less decomposed by water. To the hydrous silicates 
the permanent retention of potash and other bases is probably chiefly 
due. Humus has a great absorbent power for ammonia. Other bases, as 
magnesia and lime are also retained by soil, but in a less powerful man- 
ner than are potash and ammonia. 

Soils destitute of carbonate of calcium take up very little potash or 
ammonia when these are applied as salts of powerful acids, as for instance, 
the chlorides, nitrates, and sulphates. When carbonate of calcium is pre- 
sent the potassium or ammonium salt is decomposed, the base is retained 
by the soil, while the acid escapes into the drainage-water united with 
calcium. The addition of carbonate of calcium may thus greatly increase 
the retentive power of a soil for bases. 

The fertility of a soil is nearly connected with its power of retaining 
plant food. Sandy soils, from their small chemical retentive power, and 
free drainage, are of small natural fertility, and dependent on immediate 
supplies of manure. 

There can be little doubt that the plant food contained in soil which is 
capable of being taken up by roots, exists either in solution, or in the 
states of combination just referred to that is in union with ferric oxide, 



THE CHEMISTRY OF THE FAKM. 413 

hydrous .silicates, and humus. Different crops have very different powers 
of attacking these various forms of plant food. 

The operations of tillage and drainage serve in several ways to increase 
the amount of plant food which is at the disposal of a crop. 

By tillage the surface soil is kept in an open porous condition, favour- 
able for the distribution of roots. By this means also capillary attrac- 
tion is diminished, and the land consequently suffers less from 
drought ; the water-holding power of the surface soil is also increased. 
A more important result of tillage is that the soil is thoroughly exposed 
to the influence of the air. Soils containing humus or clay will absorb 
ammonia from the atmosphere, and thus increase their store of nitrogen. 
The organic remains of former crops and manuring are also oxidised, the 
nitrogen being converted into nitric acid. The rocky fragments which a 
soil contains, as fragments of silicates or limestone, will at the same time 
be more or less disintegrated by the combined action of water and air, 
assisted by the carbonic and humic acids arising from the oxidation of 
vegetable matter, and a portion of the insoluble plant food be thus brought 
into a state suited for assimilation by the roots of crops. In winter time 
the disintegration of the various ingredients of the soil is greatly assisted 
by frost. Water in freezing expands, and thus rends asunder the sub- 
stance frozen. Of the various results brought about by tillage, the in- 
creased production of nitrates must be ranked among the most im- 
portant. 

By drainage the various chemical actions we have just mentioned are 
carried down to a greater or less extent into the subsoil, for as the water 
level is lowered the air enters from above to fill the cavities in the soil. 
By drainage also the depth to which roots will penetrate is increased, for 
roots will not grow in the absence of oxygen, and rot as soon as they 
reach a permanent water level. In a water-logged soil deoxidation is 
active, the nitrates present are destroyed, a part of the nitrogen being 
evolved as gas ; the soil may thus suffer a considerable loss of plant 
food. 

Burning is occasionally resorted to as a means of increasing the avail- 
able plant food, and improving the texture of a heavy soil. The soil is 
burnt in heaps, which are then spread over the land. If the soil con- 
tains limestone it is easy to see that the phosphates of the limestone may 
become more available by the complete disintegration which attends the 
conversion into lime. The lime will also attack the silicates of the soil at 
a high temperature, and liberate a part of the potash from its insoluble 
combinations. To produce the best results it is essential that the burning 



414 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

should take place at a low temperature. This treatment by burning is a 
very extreme one, and can be recommended only in few cases ; it must 
always be attended with an entire loss of the nitrogen in the soil burnt. 
The ploughing in of burnt clay is of use in improving the texture of 
heavy land. 

THE CHEMISTRY OF CROPS. 

To understand the chemistry of crops we must first inquire as to their 
composition. The following table gives the average composition of ordi- 
nary farm crops. The quantities of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen present 
are omitted, also some of the smaller ash constituents. By " pure ash " 
is understood the ash minus sand, charcoal, and carbonic acid. 

The composition of grain and of all seeds, is tolerably constant ; but the 
composition of straw, leaves, roots, and tubers, will vary very considerably 
according to the character of the soil, manure, and season.

CEREAL CROPS. These contain much less nitrogen than either the 
leguminous or root crops ; about three quarters of the nitrogen is in the 
grain, and only one quarter in the straw. The amount of phosphoric acid 
is not very different from that found in other crops ; this ingredient is, in 



41(3 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

fact, the most constant of all the constituents of crops ; it is chiefly con- 
centrated in the grain. Potash and lime are present in much smaller 
quantity than in other crops ; they are chiefly concentrated in the straw. 
The presence of a large amount of silica is characteristic of the cereal 
crops ; they possess apparently a capacity for feeding on silicates not en- 
joyed by other crops. The base of the silicate is made use of by the 
plant, while the silica itself is excreted upon the surface of the leaves and 
straw. It has been shown that silica is by no means essential for the 
growth of cereals ; they take it up freely, but can also do without it. 

The fall sown cereals (wheat and rye) have both deeper roots, and a 
longer period of growth, than the spring sown cereals, and are better able 
than the latter to supply themselves with the necessary ash constituents 
from the soil. Barley possesses a considerable development of root near 
the surface, and is apparently more capable of obtaining nitrogen from the 
soil than wheat. 

Cereal crops derive their nitrogen almost exclusively from nitrates ; the 
form in which the great bulk of the nitrogen is present in the soil is un- 
suitable for them. Notwithstanding, therefore, the small amount of 
nitrogen contained in cereal crops, they rank among those most benefited 
by nitrogenous manures. Phosphates, though of little use by themselves, 
are also beneficial (especially in the case of spring crops) when applied with 
nitrogenous manure. A nitrogenous guano, or an application of nitrate of 
sodium and superphosphate, is generally the most effective manuring for 
a cereal crop. 

MEADOW HAY. -The grasses which form the main bulk of hay belong 
to the same family of plants as the cereal crops ; the seed, however, in 
grass bears such a small proportion to the stem and leaf that meadow hay 
may be regarded as a straw crop. In accordance with this character hay 
is found to contain a much larger proportion of potash and lime than 
cereal crops ; and a much smaller amount of phosphoric acid. 

The roots of grass being far shorter than those of the cereals are less 
able to collect ash constituents from the soil ; if therefore grass is mown 
for hay, manures containing potash, lime, and phosphoric acid will gen- 
erally be required. Like the cereal crops grass is greatly increased iu 
luxuriance by the application of soluble nitrogenous manures. 

Farmyard manure, or the feeding of cake, grain, or roots on the land, is 
the most appropriate manuring for permanent pasture, if quality as well 
as quantity of produce is considered. Large crops of hay may be obtained 
by manuring with nitrate of sodium, together with kainit and super- 



THE CHEMISTRY OF THE FARM. 417 

phosphate; but a continuance of such treatment promotes a coarse herb- 
ga 

The natural clovers of a meadow are destroyed by the continued 
application of highly nitrogenous manures, a hay consisting almost exclu- 
sively of grass being produced. The clovers are developed by the appli- 
cation of manures supplying potash and lime, and by pasturing instead of 



mowing. 



The perennial character of grass, and the abundance of humus in a 
pasture soil, present favourable conditions for the collection of nitrogen 
from the atmosphere ; this takes place to a greater extent on pasture land 
than with most other crops. 

LEGUMINOUS CHOPS. Some of these are grain crops, as beans and peas- 
others are fodder crops, as red clover, sainfoin and lucerne. A strikinw 
characteristic of all these crops is the large amount of nitrogen which 
they contain, the quantity being about twice as great as that found in 
cereal crops. The quantity of potash and lime in leguminous crops is also 
very large. The relative proportion of these two bases varies much in 
crops grown on different soils ; upon a calcareous soil lime will prepon- 
derate in the crop, but on a clay soil potash. The lime is found chiefly in 
the leaf. Silica is nearly absent in leguminous crops. 

The nutrition of leguminous crops is not at present perfectly under- 
stood. A good crop of red clover, when cut for hay, removes a large 
quantity of nitrogen from the land, but it nevertheless leaves the surface 
soil actually richer in nitrogen than it was before from the residue of 
roots and stubble left in the soil. From whence is this large quantity of 
nitrogen obtained ? It must be procured either from the subsoil, or the 
atmosphere. The former seems the more probable, as experiments have 
hitherto failed to prove that leguminous plants have any special power of 
obtaining nitrogen from the air. The question is further complicated by 
the fact that nitrogenous manures generally produce but little effect upon 
leguminous crops. It seems pretty certain that leguminous crops possess 
to some extent a distinct source of nitrogen ; they are probably capable 
of feeding on some compounds of nitrogen and carbon which are compar- 
tively useless to other crops, and hence the facility with which they acquire 
nitrogen from the soil. A deeply rooted crop like red clover collects 
nitrogenous compounds from the subsoil, and accumulates nitrogen at the 
surface in the form of a crop. 

The particular food supply of a leguminous crop becomes exhausted by 
repeated cropping, and the land is said to be " clover " or " bean sick ; " 



AA 



418 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

no means of remedying this condition is known save by the growth of 
other crops for a series of years. 

Potash manures have generally a very beneficial effect upon leguminous 
crops ; they fail, however, to cure clover sickness. Gypsum is also valuable, 
though to a less extent. 

ROOT CROPS. All these crops contain a large amount both of nitrogen 
and ash constituents ; among the latter potash greatly preponderates. Tur- 
nips contain more sulphur than any other farm crop. 

The turnip and mangel crop differ in several respects. Turnips and 
swedes draw their food chiefly from the surface soil. Their power of 
taking up nitrogen from the soil is distinctly greater than that of the 
cereal crops. Turnips are also well able to supply themselves with potash 
when growing in a fertile soil, but they have singularly little power of 
appropriating the combined phosphoric acid of the soil ; fresh applications 
of phosphatic manures thus always produce a marked effect on this crop. 

Mangels have far deeper roots than turnips, and also a longer period of 
growth. They have a great capacity for drawing food from the soil, in- 
cluding both nitrogen, potash, and phosphoric acid. When removed off 
the land they are probably the most exhaustive a crop a farmer can grow. 
As mangels have not the same difficulty that turnips have of attacking 
the combined phosphoric acid of the soil, phosphatic manures are, in their 
case, of much less importance. Purely nitrogenous manures, as nitrate of 
sodium, when applied alone to mangels, generally produce a great effect 
on the crop ; this is not the case with turnips, which require phosphates 
as well as nitrogen in their manure. 

As both turnips and mangels consume extremely large amounts of plant 
food, a liberal general manuring with farmyard manure is in most cases 
essential for the production of a full crop ; but the special characteristic 
of the manure for turnips should be phosphatic, and of that for mangels 

nitrogenous. 

Potatoes are surface feeders, and require a liberal general manuring t 

ensure an abundant crop. 

As both root crops and potatoes require large supplies of potash, kainit 
will be found of service on land naturally poor in that ingredient. It will 
be chiefly required when the crops are raised with artificial manures only, 
as farmyard manure will always supply a considerable amount of potash. 

It is worth noting in these times in our Provincial history that the 
growth of forest timber is far less exhaustive to the soil than ordinary 
farm culture. The demand on the soil becomes, however, considerably 
greater if the trees are cut when young young timber and small branches

being far richer both in nitrogen and ash constituents than the mature 
wood. 

THE ADAPTATION OF MANURES TO CROPS. The true economy of manure 
can be understood only when we are acquainted with the special charac- 
ters of the crops we cultivate. The composition of a crop is no sufficient 
guide to the character of the manure appropriate to it, even when we possess 
in addition the composition of the soil on which it is to be grown. It is not 
only the materials required to form a crop, but the power of the crop to 
assimilate these materials which must form the basis of our judgment. 
This fact has been much overlooked by many scientific writers, who have 
counselled farmers to manure their land in every case with all the consti- 
tuents required by the crop, a proceeding both impracticable and unneces- 
sary. In the case of a barren sand it may indeed be requisite to supply 
all the constituents of plant food before a crop can be grown, but such a 
case is far from the circumstances of ordinary agriculture. 

When land is in a fertile condition the total amount of plant food avail- 
able for crops is very considerable, and luxuriant growth may be obtained 
by supplementing the stores of the soil with the few particular elements of 
food which the crop it is wished to grow has most difficulty in obtaining. 
Thus, in a large majority of cases, a dressing of nitrate of sodium and 
superphosphate will ensure a full crop of wheat, barley, or oats, and in 
many cases nitrate of sodium alone will prove very effective. These cereal 
crops generally find the supply of nitrates in the soil insufficient for their 
full growth, and the supply of phosphates more or less inadequate ; but 
in a majority of cases they are well able to obtain a sufficient supply of 
potash, and other essential elements of food. We are thus able, by sup- 
plying one or two constituents of the crop, to obtain a luxuriant harvest. 
In the same way nitrate of sodium employed alone will, in most cases, 
produce a large crop of mangels ; superphosphate alone, a large crop of 
turnips ; while potassium salts alone may be strikingly effective with pas- 
ture and clovers. 

This special manuring for each crop is no strain on the capabilities of 
the soil if a rotation of crops be followed. If superphosphate is applied 
for the turnips, potash for the seeds, and a nitrogenous manure for the 
cereal crops, the more important elements of plant food contained in the 
soil will not be diminished at the end of the rotation. At the same time 
the most economic result will have been obtained from the manures em- 
ployed, for each manure will have been supplied to that particular crop 
with which it yields the most remunerative result. 



4 9Q THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

It is doubtless possible by means of rotations manured on the above 
principles to farm successfully with the sale of all the crops produced, and 
without the use of farmyard manure ; this is possible at least so long as 
artificial manures can be obtained at a low price. In the majority of 
cases however, the special manuring will only be required to supplement 
the general manuring by farmyard manure. Under these circumstances 
it would seem best, from a chemical point of view, to apply the farmyard 
manure to those crops which most require potash, or which stand most in 
need of a general manuring ; such crops would be pasture, seeds, turnips 

and potatoes.

HE term Botany is derived from the Greek word 

meaning an herb or grass. As a science it includes every- 
thing relating to the vegetable kingdom, whether in a 
living or in a fossil state. Its object is not, as some have 
supposed, merely to name and arrange the vegetable pro- 
ductions of the globe. It embraces a consideration of the 
external forms of plants of their anatomical structure, 
however minute of the functions which they perform 
of their arrangement and classification of their dis- 
tribution over the globe at the present and at former epochs, and of the 
uses to which they are subservient. It examines the plant in its ear- 
liest state of development, when it appears as a simple cell, and follows it 
through all its stages of progress until it attains maturity. It takes a 
comprehensive view of all the plants which cover the earth, from the 
minutest lichen or moss, only visible by the aid of the microscope, to the 
most gigantic productions of the tropics. It marks the relations which 
subsist between all members of the vegetable world, and traces the mode 
in which the most despised weeds contribute to the growth of the mighty 
denizens of the forest. It is a science, then, which demands careful and 
minute investigations requires great powers of observation and research, 
and, is well fitted to train the mental powers to vigorous and prompt ac- 
tion. 

Botany may be divided into the following departments : 1. Structural 
Botany, having reference to the anatomical structure of the various parts 
of plants, including vegetable Histology, or the microscopic examination 
of tissues. 2. Morphological Botany, or the study of the form of plants 
and their organs ; these two departments are often included under the 
general term of Organography. 3. Physiological Botany, which is by 
some termed Organology, the study of the life of the entire plant and its 
organs, or the consideration of the functions of the living plant. 4. Tax- 
ological Botany, or the arrangement, and classification of plants. 5. Geo- 
graphical Botany, the consideration of the mode in which plants are dis- 
tributed over the different quarters of the globe. 6. Palceontological Bo- 



422 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

tany, the study of the forms and structures of the plants found in a fossil 
state in the various strata of which the earth is composed. 

But more particularly for our purpose, this science may be divided into 
two distinct branches. (1) Systematic Botany, and (2) Vegetable Physi- 
ology. The first teaches the names, uses, history, and classification of 
plants, the second, the manner in which the various organs of plants are 
formed, the purposes for which they have been destined, the manner in 
which they act, and are influenced by internal causes. 

Systematic botany is of direct importance to farmers, so far as it enables 
them to recognise the various plants employed in cultivation, or the weeds 
which are troublesome to them. 

Vegetable physiology, however, is that part of botany which farmers 
should make themselves well acquainted with. There is scarcely an oper- 
ation in the art of agriculture which does not depend upon a knowledge 
of the phenomena which are explained by*vegetable physiology, and no- 
man can possibly understand the principle on which he acts unless he has 
made himself master of its fundamental laws. All the great improvements 
in the preparation of land for cropping were proposed in the first instance 
by vegetable physiologists, or depend essentially upon the operation of 
laws which they have explained. Drainage is one example of this ; the 
improvement of the roots of plants, the augmentation of the productive 
powers resident in particular crops, the preservation of the purity of their 
breeds, the mode of manuring them, the destruction of weeds, the manage- 
ment of timber, and many other things are wholly influenced by laws 
which it is impossible to understand correctly in the absence of a familiar- 
ity with the principles of vegetable physiology, independent of chemistry. 
A person desirous of studying agriculture upon scientific principles, requires 
to know the circumstances which affect the germination of seeds ; why 
in some seasons, they will not grow, while in others their success is per- 
fect. His attention must be drawn to the conditions most favourable or 
unfavourable to the progress of the seedling plant, to the gradual consoli- 
dation of its parts, to the development of the wondrous organs which the 
Creator has given it to feed with and multiply. 

They all are most important subjects of consideration with those who 
would study agriculture philosophically, or who expect to introduce im- 
provements into ordinary practice, for although it may be true that acci- 
dent has led to more discoveries than science ; yet there can be no doubt 
that such discoveries would have been long anticipated had science been 
consulted 



THE BOTANY OF THE FARM. 423 

In examining the Vegetable Kingdom, we observe that the individuals 
composing it are formed by the Almighty in accordance with a principle 
of order, as well as a principle of special adaptation. In other works on 
Botany the structure and arrangements of the various parts of the root, 
stem, leaves, and flowers of plants, and their different functions will be 
found. It is our present duty to apply the facts of vegetable anatomy 
and physiology to the classification of plants, and to consider the plan 
according to which they are grouped together in classes and families. 

We see around us various kinds or sorts of plants, more or less resem- 
bling each other or, in other words, more or less related to each other. 
in Systematic Botany we endeavour to mark these resemblances, and to 
determine their relations. It is impossible to give a scientific arrange- 
ment of the plants of the globe without a thorough knowledge of struc- 
ture, and without an extensive acquaintance with the vegetation of all 
parts of the world. We cannot expect to determine the system on which 
plants have been grouped, until we are familiar with all the forms which 
they present. Hence, in the present state of our knowledge, there must 
be imperfection in our attempts at systematising. The floras of many 
regions in Africa, India, China,' Australia, and America, are still unknown, 
and we may therefore conclude that in all systems there will be gaps, to 
be filled up as our knowledge increases. Sufficient, however, is known 
to enable us to group plants according to certain evident alliances. 

The necessity for arrangement is evident, when we reflect that there 
are probably 1 50,000 known species of plants on the earth. In order to 
make these available for scientific purposes, it is absolutely essential that 
they should be named and classified. In associating plants in certain 
groups, we naturally proceed on an idea of resemblance or likeness. While 
in ordinary language this idea is vague and indefinite, in scientific langu- 
age it must be strict and rigorous, It is not enough to say that one plant 
resembles another in its general aspect, we must ascertain the particulars 
of agreement, and the points in which they differ ; we must weigh well 
the importance of the characters, and must compare organs which are 
equivalent in value ; and thus we shall often find, that plants which to 
common observers appear alike are in reality totally different. The study 
of the anatomy of plants gives us a strict and accurate technical langu- 
age which must be rigidly adhered to in classification. 

Plants, as they occur in nature, are viewed as individuals resembling or 
differing from each other. Some individuals are so decidedly alike that 
we at once give them the same name. Thus a field of wheat is com- 
posed of numerous similar individuals which can be separated from each 



42 1 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

other, but cannot be distinguished by any permanent or marked differ- 
ence. Although there may be some variation in size and other minor 
points, still we at once say they are stalks of wheat. Every grain of 
wheat, when sown, produces a stalk of wheat ; these stalks yield grains, 
which produce individuals like their parents. The shoots or buds given 
off from the base of wheat by tillering also produce stalks of wheat. On 
such universal and inevitable conceptions as these, our ideas of Species 
are founded. 

A Species may be defined as an assemblage of individuals presenting 
certain constant characters in common, and derived from one original 
stock. For each species we believe that there has been a parent stock, 
which has given origin to a succession of similar individuals. They may 
differ slightly in size, or in colour, and other unimportant respects, but 
they resemble each other more closely than they resemble any other plant, 
and their seeds produce similar individuals. Observation and common 
daily experience demonstrate, in the actual circumstances in which we 
exist, the permanence of the types which constitute the species of living 
bodies. There is no evidence whatever of a transmutation of species. 
The erroneous statement regarding the conversion of oats into rye or 
wheat into chess have proceeded from imperfect observations. The indi- 
viduals, however, of a species may present certain differences in regard to 
size, colour, etc., these differences depending on soil, and on varying con- 
ditions of heat, light, and moisture. Such differences are not incompat- 
ible with the idea of a common origin, and, moreover, there is always a 
tendency to return to the original type. What are called Varieties there- 
fore, are variations in species, which are not in general of a permanent 
character, and cannot be kept up in ordinary circumstances by seed. By 
cultivation, however, such varieties are sometimes perpetuated. This is 
usually accomplished by means of cuttings or grafts, and in certain instan- 
ces even by seed. Thus the varieties of the cereal grains and of culinary 
vegetables have been propagated so as to constitute permanent Races. 

Plants under cultivation are liable to sport, as it is called, and the pecu- 
liarities and variations thus produced are sometimes kept up. All the 
varieties of cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, savoys, and curled greens, are 
derived from one stock Brassica oleracea. This plant grows wild on 
the sea-shore, and when cultivated it undergoes remarkable changes. 
Thus it forms a heart, as in ordinary cabbage ; its flower- stalks become 
thickened and shortened, as in cauliflower and broccoli ; or cellular tissue 
is largely developed between the vessels of the leaves, so as to give rise 
to the crisp and curly appearance of the greens. This tendency in the 



THE BOTANY OF THK FAKM. 425 

to produce monstrosities was early noticed by cultivators, and care 
was taken to propagate those individuals which showed abnormal appear- 
ances. The seeds of such were saved, put into good soil, and no plants 
were allowed to remain except such as presented the required form. In 
this manner, certain races of culinary vegetables have been established. 
If, however, these cultivated plants are allowed to grow wild and scatter 
their seed in ordinary soil, they will, in the progress of time, revert to 
the original type or species. Instances such as these show the remark- 
able effects of cultivation in perpetuating varieties by seed. In regard to 
the cereal grains wheat, barley, oats, etc. they have been so long culti- 
vated that we are at a loss to know the original types or species. We 
have been forced, in the meantime, to call them species, although they 
are probably mere cultivated varieties of unknown species, perpetuated 
as races. 

It is of great importance to distinguish between mere varieties and true 
species, and to determine the limits of variation of different species. By 
not attending to this, many mere varieties have for the time been described 
as species, and thus great confusion and incorrectness have arisen both in 
descriptions and in arrangements. Another source of fallacy arises from 
hybrids being occasionally reckoned as true species. 

Certain species not identical in origin, have common features of resem- 
blance, and are associated together under what is called a Genus. A 
genus, then, is an assemblage of nearly-related species, agreeing with one 
another, in general structure and appearance, more closely than they 
accord with other species. Thus, the Scotch rose, the Dog rose, the China 
rose, and the Sweet-briar, are all different species included in one genus, 
Rosa, which is well characterised by its fruit, known as the hep of the 
rose. It may happen that a single species may be reckoned as forming 
a genus, when the peculiarities are as marked as those constituting other 
genera. Thus, if there was only one species of oak, it would be sufficient 
to constitute a genus, as much so as at present when it includes about 200 
species. It is distinguished by its acorn from other allied genera, such as 
the beech, the hazel, and the chestnut. The species in a genius present 
one general plan, and may be said to be formed after the same pattern. 
Some species of a genus, having special points of resemblance, may be 
grouped together in a Sub-ge/ 

On looking at genera, it will be seen that some of them, such as oaks, 
hazels, beeches, and chestnuts, have a strong resemblance or family like- 
ness, and that they differ remarkably from such genera as firs and pines 
maples and ashes. Certain genera may in this way be grouped so as to 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

form Orders or Families. While genera are groups of allied species, orders 
are groups of allied genera, or, in reality, more comprehensive genera. 
Thus, firs, pines, and larches belong to different genera, but all agree in 
being cone-bearing, and are grouped under Coniferse. The rose, the rasp- 
berry, the bramble, the strawberry, the cinquefoil, the cherry, and the 
plum, all agree in their general form and structure, and are united under 
Rosacese. Certain genei'a have more points in common than others, and 
are grouped together under sub-divisions of orders called Sub-orders. 
Thus, the plum and the cherry have a drupe as their fruit, and are more 
nearly allied to each other than they are to the apple ; again, the straw- 
berry, raspberry, and bramble, are more allied to each other than to the 
cherry or apple. We have thus Sub-orders of Rosaceae namely, Amyg- 
dalete, including the plum, peach, cherry, and almond ; Pomese, including 
the apple, pear, medlar, and quince ; Potentillese, including the strawberry, 
cinquefoil, and raspberry ; and Rosese, comprehending the roses. 

Certain orders, agreeing in evident and important general characters, 
are united together so as to form Classes ; and sub-divisions of classes are 
made in the same way as in the case of orders. There are thus Sub-classes 
associating certain orders included in one class. 

The usual divisions are thus Classes, Orders, Genera, and Species. These 
occur in all systems of classification. A more minute subdivision may be 
made as follows : 



I. Classes. 

a. Sub-classes. 
II. Orders or Families. 

a. Sub-orders. 

b. Tribes. 



c. Sub-tribes. 



III. Genera. 



a. Sub-genera. 



IV. Species. 



a. Varieties. 






An enumeration of the marks by which one Class, Order, Genus, or 
Species, is distinguished from another is called its character. In giving 
the characters of any division, we notice merely those which are necessary 
to distinguish it from others. This is called the Essential Character. A 

O 

plant may also be described completely, beginning at the root, and pro- 
ceeding to the stem, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit, seed, and embryo. 
This is not essential, however, for the purpose of classification, and would 
be quite superfluous in that point of view. In the character of classes the 
important points of structure on which they are constituted are given. In 
the character of orders (the ordinal character) we give the general struc- 
ture of the included plants, especially of their flowers and fruit. In the 
generic character we notice the modification of the ordinal character in a 



THE BOTANY OF THE FARM. 427 

given genus the character being taken from the parts of the flower and 
fruit, as in the order. In the specific character are included certain less 
important modifications of form, whether in the stem, leaves, or flowers, 
which serve to distinguish allied species. 

The names of the Classes are variously derived, according to the views 
of the authors in regard to classification. They express some points of 
structure or development which are of marked importance or permanence, 
The orders are named from some characteristic genus included in them, 
except in artificial methods, where some organ is taken as the means of 
distinction. Genera are derived either from the Latin name of one of the 
species, from the structure or qualities of the included species, or from the 
name of some botanist, etc. Thus Prunus is a genus including the plum, 
the sloe, etc. ; Rosa, the rose ; Papaver, the poppy ; Hookeria is a genus 
named after Hooker; Lithospermum, from two Greek words signifying a 
stone and seed, is given to a genus, the species of which have hard stony 
ichenes. 

In giving the name of a plant, we mention its genus and species. Thus 
the common Dog-rose is called Rosa canina, the first being the generic 
name, the second the specific. Specific names may indicate the country in 
which a plant is found, the locality in which it grows, the form of its 
roots, stem, or leaves, the colour of its flowers, the name of its discoverer 
or describer, etc. To the genus and species are added certain letters indi- 
cating the botanist who founded them. Thus, Valeriana,, L. is the genus 
Valerian, as constituted by Linnaeus ; and Valeriana officinalis, L. is the 
officinal Valerian as described by Linnreus. 

In the systems of classification there are two pursued in the arrange- 
ment of plants; one is called the Artificial method, and the other the Natural 
method. The higher divisions of classes and orders in these systems are 
founded on entirely different principles, while the genera and species, or 
the minor divisions, are the same in both. The genera and species are 
very differently arranged in the two systems. In artificial methods one 
or two organs are selected in an arbitrary manner, and they are taken as 
the means of forming classes and orders ; while in the natural method 
plants are grouped according to their alliance in all their important cha- 
racters. Plants belonging to the same class and order in the former sys- 
tem may have nothing in common except the number of the stamens and 
pistils, or the form of their flowers, or some other arbitrarily-selected cha- 
racter ; while in the latter, plants in the same class and order are related 
by true affinity, and correspond in all the essential points of their struc- 
ture. When a student knows the artificial class and order to which a plant 



428 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

is to be referred, he does not thereby become acquainted with its struc- 
ture and properties ; plants diametrically opposed in these respects may 
be associated together. When he determines, on the other hand, the place 
of a plant in the natural system, he necessarily acquires a knowledge of 
its structural relations and affinities. Hence a knowledge of the latter 
system must be the aim of the botanical student. 

NATURAL SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION. 

In arranging plants according to the natural system, the object is to 
bring together those which are allied in all essential points of structure. 
It iscalled natural, because it professes to follow the system of Nature , 
and thus takes into account the true affinities of plants on a comparison 
of all their organs. One of the first natural methods of classification was 
that proposed by Ray, about 1682. He separated flowering from flower- 
less plants, and divided the former into Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. 
His orders were founded on correct views of the affinities of plants, and 
he far outstripped his contemporaries in his enlightened views of arrange- 
ment. He may be said to have laid the foundation of that system which 
has been elucidated by the labours of Jussieu, De Candolle, Brown, Lind- 
ley, Endlicher, and others. 

In arranging plants according to a natural method, we require to have 
a thorough n knowledge of structural and morphological botany, and hence 
we find that the advances made in the latter departments have materially 
aided the efforts of systematic botanists. We may regard plants in vari- 
ous points of view, either with reference to their elementary tissues, their 
nutritive or their reproductive organs. The first two are the most impor- 
tant as being essential for the life of individuals, while the latter are con- 
cerned in the propagation of the species. These sets of organs bear a 
certain relation to each other, and we find that plants may be associate 
by a correspondence in all of them. In comparing the characters of plants, 
we must take care that we contrast organs belonging to the same class 
functions, and the value of the characters must depend upon the impor- 
tance of the functions performed by the organs. 

Cellular tissue is reckoned of the highest value, as beiug of universal 
occurrence, and as carrying on, in many instances, all the functions of 
plants. In considering the elementary tissues alone, we divide all plants 
into Cellular and Vascular the former including the lower tribes oi 
flowerless plants, such as lichens, seaweeds, and mushrooms, the latter 
eluding the higher flowerless plants with scalariform vessels, and all 



THE BOTANY OF THE FARM. 429 

flowering plants. In the nutritive and reproductive organs there is no- 
thin<r which can be considered of the same value as cellular tissue. 

o 

In the nutritive organs the embryo occupies the highest place, and by ex- 
amining it we divide plants into. Acotyledonous, having no cotyledons^ 
but occasionally producing a cellular expansion (prothallus) ; Monocotyle- 
donous with one cotyledon ; and Dicotyledonous, with two cotyledons. 
Proceeding to the secondary organs in the nutritive class, we find the 
stem is Cellular or Thallogenous, Acrogenous, Endogenous, and Exogen- 
ous. The thallus is veinless, the fronds of Acrogens have often a forked 
venation, the leaves of Endogens are parallel-veined, and those of Exo- 
gens reticulated. In the reproductive system the stamens and pistils 
occupy the highest place, as being the essential organs of flowering plants 
(Phanerogamia), while peculiar cells (antheridia and archegonia) have the 
same value in flowerless plants (Cryptogamia). Succeeding these organs 
in value comes the fruit, which is either a theca with spores, or a pericarp 
with seed. The floral envelopes are the next in the series ; they are 
absent in Cryptogamous plants, and present in Phanerogamous ; their ar- 
rano-ement is ternary in Monocotyledons, quinary and binary or quaternary 
in Dicotyledons. 

It is impossible to represent the affinities of plants in a linear series. 
Different groups touch each other at several different points, and must be 
considered as alliances connected with certain great centres. We find also 
that it is by no means easy to fix the limits of groups. There are con- 
stantly aberrant orders, genera, and species, which form links between the 
groups, and occupy a sort of intermediate position. Hence exact and 
rigid definitions cannot be carried out. 

The following is the arrangement of the NATURAL SYSTEM of De Can- 
dolle, with some division derived from Jussien and Lindley : 

CLASS I. DICOTYLEDONES, EXOGEN^E, or ACRAMPHIBRYA, in 
' which spiral vessels are present ; the stem is exogenous ; 
stomata are present, the venation of the leaves is reticulated ; 
the flowers have stamens and pistils, and the symmetry is, 
quinary, binary, or quaternary ; the ovules are either in an 
ovary or naked ; and the embryo is dicotyledonous. In 
this class there are included four Sub-classes : 
Sub-class I. THALAMIFLOR.E. Flowers usually dichlamy- 

deous, petals separate, inserted on the thalamus, and 

stamens hypogynous. 



430 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Sub-class II. CALYCIFLOR/E. Flowers usually dichlamy- 
deous, petals either separate or united, stamens either 
perigynous or epigynous. This sub-class has two sub- 
divisions 

1. Polypetalce or Dialypetalce in which the petals 

are separate. 

2. Monopetalce or Gamopetalce in which the petals 

are united. 

Sub-class III. COROLLIFLOR.E Flowers dichlamydeous, pe- 
tals united, corolla hypogynous. 

Sub-class IV. MONOCHLAMYD^E or APATAL.E flowers either 
with a calyx only or achlamydeous. In this sub-class 
there are two sub-divisions 

1. Angiospermce in which the ovules are contained 

in a pericarp, and are fertilized by the action of 
the pollen on the stigma. 

2. Gymnospermce in which the ovules are not con- 

tained in a true pericarp, and are fertilized by 
the direct action of the pollen without the inter- 
vention of a stigma, and the embryo is poly- 
cotyledonous. 

CLASS II. MONOCOTYLEDONES, ENDOGEN^, or AMPHIBRYA, 
in which spiral vessels are present ; the stem is endogen- 
nous ; stomata occur ; the venation is usually parallel, 
sometimes slightly reticulated ; the flowers have stamens 
and pistils and the symmetry is ternary ; the ovules are 
contained in an ovary ; the embryo is monocotyledonous. 
Under this Class are included three Sub-classes : 
Sub-class I. DICTYOGEN^E plants with reticulated venation 
in their leaves, which usually disarticulate with the 
stem ; woody bundles of rhizome in wedges. 
Sub-class II. PETALOIDE.E, or FLORIDA in which the 
leaves are parallel-veined ; the flowers usually consist 
either of a coloured perianth or of whorled scales. 
This sub-cless is divided into 

1. Epigynce in which the Perianth is adherent, the 
ovary is inferior, and each flower has usually 
stamens and pistil. 



THE BOTAIsT OF THE FARM. 431 

2. HypogyncB in which the Perianth is free, the 

ovary is superior, and each flower has usually 
stamens and pistil. 

3. Incompletce flowers incomplete, often staminate 

and pistillate, with no proper Perianth, or with 
a few verticillate scales. 

Sub-class III. GLUMIFEILE flowers glymaceous, consisting 
of imbricated bracts, venation parallel. 

CLASS III. ACOTYLEDONES, or ACROGEN.E, and THALLOGEN^E, 
or THALLOPHYTA and ACROBRYA, in which the 
plants are either entirely cellular, or consist partly of sca- 
lariform vessels ; the stem when woody is acrogenous ; sto- 
mata occur in the higher orders ; the leaves are either vein- 
less or have a forked venation ; no flowers are present ; the 
reproductive organs consist of Antheridia and Archegonia; 
spores or cellular embryos are produced which have no 
cotyledons. Under this class there are two divisions : 
Sub-class I. ACROGEN^E, ACROBRYA or CORMOGEN.E with 

a distinct stem, bearing leaves or branches. 
Sub-class II. THALLOGEN.E, THALLOPHYTA, or CELLULARES 

having no distinct stem nor leaves, but forming a 

cellular expansion of various kinds which bears the 

organs of reproduction. 

THE GROWTH OF PLANTS. 

In considering the growth of plants, we have to distinguish that growth 
which is mere extension of old material from that which is the result of 
the formation of new substance. We have an illustration of the first case 
in the earliest stages of germination of a seed, or in the sprouting of a 
potato in a cellar. Growth may and does take place in such instances 
without any real increase of substance, or any augmented weight save 
what may be derived from water. The plant in this stage lives upon the 
resources stored up in its tissues, and will continue to do so till they are 
exhausted. But growth, in the sense of real increase of substance or of 
increased weight from the addition of new material, depends upon the 
amount of carbon assimilated, as referable to leaves Growth is also 
effected by incorporation of new material with the old by an actual in- 
crease in the number of cells. These indicate the general nature of 
growth in the organs the root, the stem and the leaf. 



432 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

GROWTH OF ROOTS. The growing point of a root, so far as its length 
is concerned, is comprised within a small area just above the extreme tip. 
the extreme tip itself being covered by a little cap shed off from the skin 
of the root, and serving as a shield to it in its progress through the soil. 

GROWTH OF THE STEM. In the case of the stem and branches, the . 
growing points, by whose agency increase in length takes place, are placed 
at the summit of the stem, or of its subdivisions, the branches. The 
growing points then form the substance of the " buds," which are either , 
invested by leaf-scales as protectors and stores of nourishment, as in the 
case of bulb-scales, or by perfect leaves. The increase in the thickness of 
stems takes place also by means of the growing tissue, or cambium, the 
situation of which is different in the two main groups of " Exogens " and 
" Endogens." To the former series belong all our trees and shrubs, the 
clover, beet, turnips ; in the latter are the cereals and grasses. 

GROWTH OF LEAVES. The growing points of leaves occur in various 
situations, according to the kind of leaf. Sometimes, and more generally, 
the direction of principal growth is from within outward that is to say, 
from the centre outward (centrifugal) ; in other cases the general tendency 
is in the opposite direction (centripetal). 

THE ACTION OF MOISTURE ON ROOTS. Much more obvious to the gen- 
eral observer is the action of moisture on roots. The distance to which 
roots will travel in search, as it were, of water, and the way in which 
luxuriant growth and intricate ramification are promoted, when access to 
it is obtained, are familiar facts. Too frequently drain pipes get choked 
with a mass of roots whose structure has been changed, and whose exces- 
sive growth has been stimulated by the presence of copious supplies of 
moisture. If there is an equal supply of water all round, the growth of 
the roots will be uniform ; but if, as is more often the case, there is more- 
water on one side than on the other, then the root will curve to the side 
where there is the fullest supply, and the power thus exerted to get at the 
water is greater than that of gravity. 

THE ACTION OF LIGHT AND HEAT ON ROOTS. The direct action of ligbt 
upon roots is, of course, usually of a negative character. The form and 
direction of growth in the root may, however, be affected by differences of 
temperature, experienced now on one side, now on another. Darwin has- 
shown that the movements of roots, due to irritation or contact, are checked 
by too high or too low a temperature. During their passage through the 
soil, the roots must be constantly subjected to variations of temperature, 
first on one side and then on another, the variations giving rise to some of 
the curvatures and bends of the rootlets. 



THE BOTANY OF THE FAKM. 

PRACTICAL INFERENCES. It will be obvious, then, from what has been 
thus briefly said, that for cultural purposes, such as the various operations 
connected with tillage, the nature, quantity, and time of application of 
manure, and the like, the character of root action in general, must be 
studied in connection with the nature and properties of the soil. The 
special form and characteristics of the root in the particular crop it is 
wished to cultivate tap-rooted, fibrous-rooted, fleshy, surface-rooting, 
or deep-rooting, etc. must also be taken into consideration in the same 
relation. 

Ai TION OF HEAT ANJ> MOISTURE UPON LEAVES. A few words upon the 
influence of excessive temperatures may be appropriately given. 

If the temperature fall below a given point, variable for each species 
and also for each individual plant, the functions of the leaf are held in 
abeyance, chlorophyll is only imperfectly formed (hence the yellow tinge 
of frosted wheat) ; and if the temperature be still further depressed, death 
results. 

ACTION OF FROST. When a leaf is frozen, the fluid contents escape from 
the cells by permeation through their membrane, and freeze on the outside 
of the cell, so that the spaces between them are full of ice. It rarely hap- 
pens that the juices of the cells freeze in the interior of the cells if 
they do, rupture of the cell wall and death are the most probable re- 
sults. Under ordinary circumstances, the cells lose that * turgescence 
which is necessary for their activity. All the functions of life are arrested, 
not necessarily never to be resumed ; for, in some cases, when the ice in the 
tissues of the plant melts, the water is re-absorbed by the membrane, and 
life action is resumed. Winter wheat must frequently become frozen in 
this manner, but it is comparatively rarely that the plant is killed out- 
right, farmers wisely choosing those varieties which experience has shown 
to be the hardiest. If the cold is sufficient to kill the leaves, or any por- 
tion of them, the leaves become limp and blackened. The limpness is 
easily accounted for by the causes we have mentioned, as well as by the 
stoppage of supplies of water from the root. The discolouration is the 
effect of some molecular change in the chlorophyll, at present not under- 
stood. 

ACTION OF EXCESSIVE HEAT ON LEAVES. Too high a temperature also 
arrests or perverts all the functions of the leaf. Where transpiration is 
excessive, and the absorption of fresh supplies not in proportion, the 
leaves speedily wither, as may be seen in a field of mangels on a hot day, 
when the evaporation of watery vapour from the surface is greater than 
the absorption of moisture by the root. On the other hand, durino- the 
BB 



434 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

night, while the roots are still at work, the transpiring power of the leaf 
is lessened, and drops of water exude from the leaves. Where the tem- 
perature is so high as to kill the plant or leaf outright, it is the proto- 
plasm which dies ; its constitution and molecular construction become 
changed, its power of absorbing water destroyed, and thus the turgid 
condition of the cells is lost. 

INFLUENCE OF HEAT AND MOISTURE ON THE STEM. The growth of the 
stem is directly influenced by heat, there being in this as in other cases 
a minimum below which growth cannot take place, an optimum at which 
it takes place most vigorously, and a maximum beyond which heat is in- 
jurious. The favourable influence of heat it is which in part overcomes 
the influence of gravitation, and enables the stem to ascend. The stem 
will grow fastest and strongest on the side most exposed to the heat, if 
that heat be net excessive, and this tendency will remove it from the soil. 
Similarly a moist condition of the atmosphere favours growth, and the 
stem will grow the faster on the side most exposed to the moist vapour, 
and, owing to the convexity so formed, it will in consequence bend its 
free end and its concavity towards the drier side. 

GERMINATION. The conditions under which germination takes place 
need not be alluded to at any length, as they are the same as those re- 
quisite for growth, and practically every cultivator knows that air (oxy- 
gen), moisture, and heat, varying in amount according to the plant and 
according to circumstances, are required, and that his success depends in 
great measure upon the proper tillage of the soil which secures these 
requisites. When the seed, or rather the embryo plant within it, begins 
to grow, water is absorbed, the seed swells, the insoluble starch stored up 
becomes converted into glucose, or a form of sugar, by the agency of a 
nitrogenous substance which acts as a ferment. These chemical processes 
are accompanied by an evolution of heat and an outpouring of carbonic 
acid gas. Thus is it that in malting barley the grain swells, gets hot, and 
its starch is converted into sugar. As the seedling grows, both starch 
and sugar gradually disappear, although the stock of starch is continually 
replenished so long as the leaves continue to act. The nitrogeneous con- 
stituents of the seed undergo similar changes from the insoluble to the 
soluble condition, the latter being capable of transport from place to place 
as may be required. 

FERTILISATION. In the case of plants grown for their fruit or seed, as 
in the case of wheat and cereals generally, much attention has naturally 
to be paid to the conditions which favour sexual multiplication. 



THE BOTANY OF THE FARM. 



The morphological characters of the plants undergo a chano-e. In (*en- 
eral terms, it may be said that the growth of the stern is arrested,and 
the growth and mode of development of the leaves not only arrested, but 
more or less profoundly modified, so as to form the parts of the flower.' All 
parts of the flower are constructed on the same original plan as leaves. 

The process of fertilisation may be described in general terms as fol- 
lows : The ovule contains, in a cell just beneath the skin at its summit, 
one special piece of protoplasm, the " germ," which is destined to develop 
into the embryo plant. The pollen-cell consists of an outer coat and an 
inner lining ; the outer coat bursts, and the inner protoplasmic linina is 
protruded in the form of a tube, which passes down between the cells 
of the stigma and style, growing in length and feeding as it goes, like a 
parasitic fungus, on the contents of the cells of the style, till it reaches 
the ovule and comes in close proximity to, if not actually into contact 
with the germ. In consequence of this action a cell- wall is formed around 
the germ, which latter divides and subdivides in various directions, the 
result of the subdivision being the formation of an embryo plant, while 
'the ovule covering the embryo ripens into the seed. The germ is thus 
fertilised by the pollen or sperm-cell, and unless the two come in contact, 
the formation of the embryo plant does not take place. 

CROSS FERTILISATION. It has been mentioned that the flowers with 
which the farmer is concerned have for the most part their stamens and 
pistils in the same flower (hops are an exception), and therefore they may 
be described as structually hermaphrodite. It does not, however, follow 
that they are functionally hermaphrodite that is, that the pollen-grain 
of any particular flower fertilises the germ-cell of the same flower. As a 
matter of fact, the reverse usually happens, and the pollen of one flower 
exerts its influence, not upon the germ of its own flower, but upon that 
of another, perhaps situated on some other plant. Cross-fertilisation is 
often necessitated by the circumstance that while the pollen of any par- 
ticular flower may be ripe, the stigma and the germ-cell of the same flower 
may not be ripe at the same time, or vice versa, and in such case the co- 
operation of some other flower is needed. 

HYBRIDISATION is a procedure with which the gardener is much more 
familiar than the farmer. It is only a further development of cross-fertili- 
sation. Cross-fertilisation, as has been said, takes place between flowers 
>f the same individual plant, or between flowers of two different indi- 
viduals of the same species ; but hybridisation is effected by crossing the 
lowers of two separate species, as in the case of Alsike clover, which is 
said to be a hybrid between the white or Dutch clover and the red clover.

CLIMATE. The influence of weather upon crops is far 
greater than the influence of manure. If to the pos- 
session of the previous characteristics of a good soil we 
can add a good climate, we shall have all the necessary 
conditions of fertility. The importance of climate can- 
not be overrated, for it is the immediate cause of the 
vast difference in productive power between a Tropical 
and an Arctic region. The term climate expresses 
three conditions, each of which is essential to the vege- 
tative process namely, light, heat, and moisture. These three conditions 

are all due to that energy which is constantly emanating from the sun, 
and hence vegetable life becomes more and more intensely active as the 
power of the sun increases, whether it be towards the equator, or towards 
that period of the year when the sun's action is most direct and long 

continued. 

It is perhaps scarcely necessary to remind the student that the general 
character of the climate varies chiefly with latitude. If climate steadily 
improved as we travelled southward, and steadily became colder as we 
travelled north, the subject would have but little interest for agriculturists. 
This is, however, far from the case, for the climate of a country or locality 
is always considerably affected by various other circumstances besides that 
of latitude. To such an extent is this the case, that probably every farm, 
and even field, boasts a particular climate, and practical farmers take cli- 
mate into account when they are weighing the advantages or disadvan- 
tages of particular farms. 

England lies in the same latitude as Moscow, and considerably higher 
than Newfoundland. The favourable climate which, despite adverse crit- 
icisms, England enjoys, is due to its insular position and the Gulf Stream, 
and, interesting as the subject is, we cannot further enlarge upon it here. 
Besides latitude, climate varies under the following circumstances : Alti- 
tude, longitude, proximity to the sea, lakes, rivers, or marshes, aspect, char- 
acter of the soil, and situation, as affected by shelter, slope, or inclination- 
of the ground, etc. Each of these circumstances exerts a marked effect 
upon the climate of a farm, and therefore upon its productive power. 



THE FARM AND METEOROLOGY. 



437 



ALTITUDE. Wheat refuses to ripen in Britain when grown at elevations 
of from 1000 to 1200 feet, a fact which proves the influence of altitude. 
An elevation of 1500 feet is sufficient to seriously impair the fertility of 
fields for even the hardier crops. On the other hand the same, and a 
much higher altitude, on the American continent grows wheat to perfec- 
tion. 

LONGITUDE. Climate varies considerably in the matter of rainfall from 
east to west. The effect on the agriculture of the two sides of an island 
' country is also easily seen in the prevalence of grazing on the west, and 
the leaning towards the cultivation of cereals on the east. The Gulf 
Stream also acts beneficially on climate, receiving additional warmth from 
its presence. 

PROXIMITY TO THE SEA usually gives a more uniform temperature than 
is enjoyed far inland, and this is attributed to the uniform temperature of 
the adjacent mass of water. 

LAKES AND MARSHES influence climate. The latter especially often give 
rise to night fogs, which chill the ground and render the air unwholesome. 
An ordinary result is the prevalence of ague, and, it may be, certain forms 
of fever among the human population, and even the live stock of the farm 
are apt to suffer from allied ailments. 

FORESTS. The leaves of trees condense the atmospheric vapour, and 
precipitate it to the ground, as may often be noticed in a humid atmos- 
phere. It is many years since Humboldt pointed out the effect of forests 
upon the supply of springs, and the consequent injury that may follow 
from their destruction. Hills clothed with wood offer a barrier to the 
descent of cold currents of air, and are also directly a shelter from the 
wind. The difference in temperature between a bare mountain and one 
which carries a forest on its higher slopes has been often remarked. 

ASPECT is an exceedingly important element in influencing the climate. 
Who does not know the value of a southern aspect for wall-fruit, or of a 
northern aspect for a dairy ? Such cases at once show that aspect exerts 
a decided influence. Attention has been drawn to the effect of slope or 
inclination upon climate, and such effect might have been included under 
the present heading. Aspect is, however, a wider term, and might include, 
as it certainly goes beyond, slope. The aspect of a house or a bedroom is 
a matter of importance, and so also is the aspect of a field. 

SHELTER. Exposure or shelter must also be enumerated as a regulator 
of climate. An exposed situation is airy, breezy, or windy, according to 
the speed of aerial currents. It is often intensely cold, because the more 
rapidly a cold wind passes over any object, the quicker does it abstract its 



438 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

heat. Shelter, or protection from exposure, is highly valued, although in 
sultry weather we may long for the breezy unsheltered down or mountain 
side. Shelter is among the few climatic conditions which may be con- 
trolled, and hence a great deal of attention is given to it by agriculturists. 
A sheltered situation for house or homestead may be chosen, or trees may 
be planted, which in time will give what nature has denied. 

There is also a larger sense in which the term shelter is applied, as when 
a range of mountains give shelter to a large district or fertile valley, con- 
ferring upon thousands of acres the advantages of an improved climate. 
A good example of this is seen in the grazings under the shelter of the 
Rocky Mountains. 

CHARACTER OF THE SOIL is one more factor in the sum total of condi- 
tions which control climate. Any one may notice that the fog on an au- 
tumn evening hangs over a clay bed just as it hangs over a rock in mid- 
ocean. The cold nature of the clay ground first condenses the atmospheric 
vapour into a visible form. Delicate animals such as turkeys cannot be 
reared upon clay land, and clay land districts are injurious to persons 
afflicted with weak lungs. On the other hand, a dry soil admitting of free 
drainage gives a warmer and dryer, and, in a word, a more wholesome at- 
mosphere. 

It is by modifying the character of land that drainage is considered to 
be a positive improver of climate. Artificial drainage causes water to 
quickly disappear beyond the influence of evaporation, and gives those ad- 
vantages to a clay soil which are originally enjoyed only by those that are 
naturally drained. 

INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE UPON THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS OF THE SOIL. 
The importance of climate upon the fertility of soils can scarcely be over- 
rated. It is seen not only in the different amount and character of the 
products of tropical and temperate countries, but also in the varying yield 
of our fields from year to year. A few facts bearing upon these points 
may perhaps be here introduced with advantage. 

It is an ascertained fact that the period required to mature any crop 
varies with the climate. Wheat requires 160 days to ripen near Paris, 
182 days in Scotland, and only 85 days at Guelph, in Canada. So com- 
pletely does the period of growth and maturation depend upon the total 
amount of heat a crop receives, that the mean temperature of a wheat- 
growing country (taken during the period of growth) multiplied by the 
number of days required to perfect the crop, gives approximately the same 
numerical result. In other words, the total amount of heat required to 
perfect a crop of wheat is approximately the same. 



THE FARM AXD METEOROLOGY. 439 

It will be seen, therefore, that in cooler countries, like Scotland, a larger 
amount of heat is required to mature the crop than in countries where the 
>un is more powerful. In Egypt, on the banks of the Nile, with a mean 
temperature of 70 F., barley requires only 90 days ; and in South Amer- 
ica corn conies to maturity in 92 days, with a mean temperature of 81'5 
F. Examples might be multiplied, but it is unnecessary to do so, since 
those alread}' given will sufficiently show that the productive power of the 
earth may be doubled by the quickening energy of powerful heat, for two 
crops in one season become a possibility. 

Although in a less degree, many important differences in the kind, quan- 
tity, and quality of our own farm produce spring from the same cause, 
Altitude is often equivalent to latitude in its effect upon climate. If 56 
F. may be taken as the mean temperature of a good vegetating season in 
Britain, say from 1st April to 30th September, an elevation of 590 feet 
will be equivalent to the loss of 1 on an average. Such situations are 
exposed to a greater range of temperature than lower and more sheltered 
places, owing to unchecked radiation during the night, and the conse- 
quence is an element of uncertainty, which from time to time involves the 
loss of a crop. The following facts relating to the effect of climate upon 
produce may serve to illustrate this point further : 

English-grown wheat is inferior in quality to that from the south-east, 
Europe, and hot countries in general such as the American continent. 
It has been found that Indian sorts of wheat are relatively cheaper, com- 
pared with other qualities, and accordingly they have grown in demand.

HE general importance of this subject, and its special ap- 
plication to Canada, is necessarily our first consideration, 
and it is one that has been ably handled by evidence be- 
fore the recent Agricultural Commission, and other sources. 
The great points of trees or no trees, of retained moisture 
or rapid evaporation, of irregularly or regularly distributed 
rain fall, of unchecked storms or amelioration, of more or 
less temperate temperatures, and of the secondary but 
telling ones of ornament and cropping revenue all go to 
make up a chapter of keen interest in our yet but short history as a 
nation. 

Were evidence needed either to convince or stimulate us to action, the 
fact of what is being done in the conservation and replanting of forests in 
other countries should awaken both our pride and deep interest, as such 
lessons are plentiful in India, Australia, and the neighbouring Republic. 
There, Forestry is a profession and a Governmental department, system- 
atically conducted by able officers, who are liberally supplied, first, in the 
item of experiments, and then in the establishment of extensive re-cloth- 
ing of lands chosen by virtue of judgment based upon these and other 
known facts acquired by experience, or as shown by Nature herself. 

When we desire to bring this matter right home to the farmer and his 
son here, the story takes seven distinct heads : 

1. Shelter for crops. 

2. Shelter for grazing animals. 

3. Shelter for dwellings. 

4. Regulation of temperature. 

5. Regulation of rainfall. 

6. Ornamental purposes ; and 

7. As a cropping investment. 



THE CULTIVATION OF TREES AS AFFECTING THE FARM. 441 

The area and value of the forest lands of Canada are still of great mag- 
nitude ; indeed, of such magnitude that all the reliable information we 
possess from the brief notes of surveys stands as evidence of our ignor- 
ance of its variety, wealth, and extent, because any survey partakes so 
much of the character of straight-line testing that whole blocks of hund- 
reds of acres of many kinds of our best timber lie untouched and un- 
known at least to Government. It is surely within the scope of a 
reasonable outlay, and not many years' work, that the country should 
hold one map showing the principal tree crops on every surveyed lot, as 
well as on every outlined township, district, and limit. While we know 
intuitively that we are wealthier than we appear to be, it will give us no 
better standing in the world's market to make a story about it without 
actual inspection. Besides, when we talk scientifically, as we must do, in 
respect of forest influences upon many things ere practice goes afoot, it is 
most material to be thoroughly familiar with the existing condition of our 
forests as regards first, second, or any subsequent natural growths, and 
how tar they are likely to subserve the ends in view. 

The requisite proportion of tree surface to that under agriculture, is 
another of the studies yet little understood by scientists, and cannot, so 
to speak, be handled practically with any precise measure of reason, until 
further experiments point to safe data ; but, from the extreme of over- 
clearing on the one hand, to that of too much forest on the other, there is 
safe ground for no delay on the part of any Government. Of course this 
would bring up the allied point of what parts of the country should be 
conserved and what parts replanted, subject to the regulation of appropri- 
ate positions and adaptability of soil and climate in each particular ex- 
ample. 

It should be one of the particular duties of the Professor of Arboricul- 
ture to educate in regard to the susceptibility of certain kinds and / 
of trees for special purposes whether for field clumps, shelter belts, road- 
side shade, neighbourhood of dwellings, or for more extensive planting 
in addition to the management of them in all their detail from the seed- 
bed, transplanting in the nursery, preparation of land for planting, their 
annual maintenance, thinnings and their value, enemies to and diseases 
thereof, to the grazing of replanted lands, and the ultimate realization of 
the matured crop. 

Thus should we be in a position to advise our Legislatures on the great 
national problem of the special and general conversation and replanting, 
by which it would be shown that enclosing, draining, regulation of fires, 
animal trespass, and supervision stood as items of public expenditure of 



442 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA, 

the first class, so that one of the first of their duties is the establishment 
of Forest Departments, and the appointment and duties of a Conservator 
of Forests for each Province. 

But it is not with Canada alone that arboriculture has to deal in the 
future, the whole of this vast continent is concerned how much no one 
at present will ever realize, and that is what strikes at the root of man's 
indifference on the subject, that is, that he cannot himself personally hope 
to receive all the benefits from the conservation of the present trees, and 
particularly from replanting. American returns must be smart, strong and 
undoubled ; the idea of permanency in the long after years does not con- 
cern us so much as now ; we are fond enough of speculating upon cause 
and effect, and, in this matter, delight in big talk, that indeed does not 
lack for as much soundness as Europe can produce, but it is talk largely 
only. Let us add to this phase of our life by submitting some other 
thoughts on such an important subject, with the hope that we are not far 
off from acting up to what is preached. 

THE GENERAL IMPORTANCE OF FORESTRY IN NORTH AMERICA. 

It is the experience of the world that more difficulty, in all its fo rms 
is found in reclothing with trees where trees grew before, than it is to 
plant not replant a country for the first time. There is not only the 
practical fact of succession of cropping in its scientific and natural bear- 
ings as similarly realized, for example, in the products of the farm, but 
the more serious one of the indifference of its population. It is just 
a piece of human nature everywhere, that what has been felt as common 
and every body's property, is no one's particular business when remedies 
are asked for in the exigencies of public affairs. 

By Forestry is meant the whole science and practice of arboriculture ; 
the conserving, the care-taking, preservation and proper management of 
existing trees, and the replanting of land for purposes now to be discussed. 
Speaking generally we are, and we are not, deeply concerned, as a nation, 
in the more modern views of forestry. In Europe it takes a shape that 
may never be realized here, because of one thing. that one thing is large 
proprietary, the possessing within one man's power all the area and class 
of soil suitable to profitable production on a large scale, so that even that 
one man can employ officers and men in such numbers as to make profits 
certain. Cultivated America meantime is so subdivided as to effectually 
preclude all idea of sufficient massing of woods to receive equal results 
with Europe but the day may come. Though not thus situated for 






THE rri.TLVATION OF TREES A.S AITi-XTINU THE FARM. 

forest culture, we are otherwise obliged to give it a place in our rural 
economy. It is especially applicable to any country that has been a forest 
}>y nature, where in some things nature has been unthinkingly trampled 
upon, and where agricultural progress now demands the aid of her sister 
science arboriculture. We are not singular in these matters, and can 
sympathise with 

WHAT is BEING DONE IN THE CONSERVATION AND UI:I>LANTING OF 
FORESTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. 

There is no country whatever that has made its agricultural history 
and does not now complain of want of trees. India, Australia, Europe 
and the United States, all tell their story of overclearance, of the need of 
conserving, and of the necessity of replanting. Their greater years than 
ours has given experience that should encourage, and dismiss all doubts 
on our part. The effects of judicious re-clothing are already subjects of 
congratulation, and of yearly revenue in competition with agriculture, so 
much so indeed with some that the other is not uncommon talk with pro- 
prietors. India has her standing army of foresters, trained to all cunning 
in syivan matters, at European schools; Australia can already boast of 
its " Forest Board," its conservator of forests, tree nurseries, extensive 
enclosures planted and to be planted, and a whole system of arboriculture 
of the most encouraging kind, and the United States, though doing more 
talk than spade work, are unquestionably on the very margin of a revolu- 
tion, they have not gone through the forest without " seeing some fire- 
wood." 

THE OBJECTS OF CONSERVING AND REPLANTING ARE NOT A FEW. 

Mo.;t people think of trees, first of all, as means of shelter under seve- 
ral forms. We like shelter for buildings, shade for ourselves, shelter and 
shade for animals in the field and shelter for farm crops. These alone 
would make up a large value in any district where required, and would 
justify all the cost and subsequent attendance. Yet, we have another as- 
pect of the question that takes an equally strong place in our regard : 
Climate is not alone a matter of great outside causes, but one intimately 
related to local influences, among which trees are pre-eminent. We have 
no time to show how temperature, rain-fall moisture, and evapora- 
tion are directly influenced by a small or large surface of trees how 
therefore water in every form is in the hands of trees for local distribu- 
tion. This second duty of forestry as a science and practice would even 



444 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

seem to swallow up the previous question, and are consequently induce- 
ments alone to its prosecution on our part. Were neither of these suffi- 
cient, however, to convince, the third great reason for tree cultivation 
will surely convert even the most stiff-necked among us. It is no matter 
of doubt, under average conditions, in any country, that tree culture is 
more profitable as a crop than its own agriculture, year by year. This 
position is not open to question, but clear and marked in all experience 
where age has given time for proof. And lastly, some men are satisfied 
when large expenditure secures what to them is all in all ornament ; and 
assuredly ornament is value. AVho would not give 8500 more for a farm 
where the buildings are set off by just the kind, number, and proper posi- 
tion of trees and tree clumps. 

THE AREA OF LAND IN NORTH AMERICA 

is not an unknown thing. There is no case in Europe as regards smnU 
propriety, having recently occupied a forest country, and where extensive 
clearing took place for agricultural development. But it is not true that 
the American continent is now poorly wooded in comparison with other 
countries ; the United States can show twenty -five, and Canada fifty per 
cent, of the cultivated districts, as still under trees. This is possibly 
larger than any other continent, if we except the northern part of Europe, 
where agriculture is necessarily at a discount, and where the forest is 
practically untouched. What then is the cause of our discontent, if on 
an average, one-third of populated North America is still under forest? 
why do we advocate conserving and replanting ? or in other words, what 
are 

THE REQUISITE PROPORTIONS OF TREE SURFACE TO THAT UNDER AGRI- 
CULTURAL CROPS. 

This is just one of the things that we do not know, and that we are not 
likely ever to know as 11 point for general practical guidance. The con- 
ditions affecting climate are so various as affected by latitude, altitude, 
aspect, soil, sea or lake neighbourhood, and vegetation, that no possible 
number of observations, in any length of time, could say how much for 
one district is so much for another. However, men do corne to realize 
through science and practice practice especially that a farm, or a dis- 
trict, needs the protection in certain places, and thus by such a simple 
guidance alone, a country could be easily reclothed to the extent required, 
at least for shelter, if not for regulation of climate, or of sufficient area as 



THE CULTIVATION OF TUKES AS AKFECTIXG THE FARM. 

a cropping investment; this point of immediate shelter is, therefore, 
within everybody's knowledge, and needs no scientific recognition, and 
should not require any governmental spurring. But the greater field of 
climate, as an unknown one practically in this relation, is more a national 
problem, and still very much a scientific enquiry, and what it will have 
to say in regard to the proportion of trees to farm crops no one can tell. 
Of course, if we disregard everything but the direct profits from trees 
as a crop upon land, then we shall likely override all other deductions, 
and possibly bring back the days of laziness and unhealth. Viewing trees 
in all their relations, I am of opinion that upon an average of conditions 
in Ontario one-fourth of the land should be under trees, and as this is 
just one-half what we have at present, there rests the apparent inconsist- 
ency of wanting to conserve and replant, all the while that we have 
double what is needed. This brings out the fact that it is the irrer/u- 
Id r distribution of tree surface in our case which gives trouble, that some 
parts have more than required, and others have been over-cleared. So then 

THE EXISTING CONDITION OF OUR FORESTS. 

is the very first consideration in this enquiry. What is the condition of 
all our woodlands, both in the older and newer townships at the present 
moment, and what should be done with them in order to their best main- 
tenance such a maintenance as shall secure annual revenue, shelter, and 
climatic amelioration along with the due agricultural development ? 

Outside of the lumbering interest there is no enclosing, preserving care- 
taking, or conserving in any sense, except the right of individual owner- 
ship, some of whom do act the forester, but nationally there is nothing 
recognised, and hence waste. The average bush of North America is a 
beautiful sight, and yet a sad one. The artist must revel in its variety 
of form, and foliage, but the fighting for place, the scraggy monarch of 
throe hundred years, smothering even as he dies, scores of plants that but 
for him would attain to value; the general want of light and air, and 
otherwise a decay and loss, recognised only by those who are scientifically 
and practically foresters. I do not mean that our forests in cverv case 
should be managed similarly to those in Europe, because most of our best 
timber requires very different conditions, but similar principles ought to 
guide our management. While then, we owe a steady eye to progressive 
judicious replanting, it is above all others our first duty to manage well 
what we do possess. It will be cheapest, the most rapid, and the most 
sure method of re-adjusting matters along, no doubt, with a certain re- 
planting of cleared land. No fear need exist in regard to 



446 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

THE ADAPTABILITY OF SOILS AND CLIMATE TO RAPID RESULTS, 

for nature herself has already shown us what to do both in repeating the 
same kind of crops, and in the proper rotation of trees, by sections of the 
country. But that nature has been the best guide in most things is not 
admitted. We cannot follow her in the mode of thinning out so many an- 
nually, in making branchless stems, and therefore leafless and shelterless 
trees, comparatively. It is sound in practice, though not in theory, that 
ten trees, of certain kinds, standing within a given area, will afford less 
shelter, less wind break, than three trees of exactly the same sort, properly 
managed on the like area. We have soils and climates wherewith to do 
almost anything in tree life from the pine of the north, which luxuriates 
in an apparently bare rock cleft, to the walnut of the south, that must 
send its carroty root several feet into a rich soil. European forest reve- 
nue begins, on an average, fifteen years after planting ; that of America 
ten years afterwards. 

As the subject grows upon our attention, we are next concerned with 

WHAT PAKTS OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CONSERVED OH REPLANTED 

and in this part of the study it is obvious that our views cannot be con- 
fined to single farms, or even special sections. Referring, as we must, to 
the great over- ruling influences, as previously indicated, we have to deal 
with eographical features that may embrace thousands of acres that have 
to be subserved by one, or more, massing of trees. Just where to con- 
serve or replant, how much on the spot, or spots, in what particular form 

belt, clump, or block and with what kinds of trees, so as to gather and 

dispense all the virtues that trees are known to possess, is the great prob- 
lem of the future. To say that we should replant only our less valuable 
soils is nonsense, though sensible enough from the cultivated standpoint ; 
that high lands should be conserved or reclad as against lower parts Ls 
largely true, though not generally applicable, and that conserving and re- 
planting must go hand in hand, and take place anywhere as found neces- 
sary through experience, is correct in every sense. 

Following this view of the subject there is naturally that of 

SUITABILITY OF CERTAIN KINDS AND FOKMS OF TREES FOK SPKCJAI. 

PURPOSES, 

Whether for neighbourhood of dwellings, road-side shade, shelter -belts, 
field clumps, or for more extensive planting, efficiency and permanency in 



THE CULTIVATION OF TREES AS AFFECTING THE FARM. 447 

every example are the primary considerations. It is not difficult, because 
experience is extensive, to decide on those species of trees for roadside, 
and house shelter, but much has not been done for the others, and so 
some advice will not be out of place. 

To attain all the objects desired in replanting it is obvious that manv 
varieties together in one clump or plantation would be indispensable ; 
early shelter and rapid returns for the money invested would be best se- 
cured by certain kinds of trees more than others ; such trees would also 
s-Tve as nurses to others, and permanency in their case would not be 
wanted, but we would desire in their character a full and spreading foli- 
age coming early and remaining late in the season, or even through- 
out the winter, to attain size in ten or fifteen years, and to be of a quality 
that would fetch a handsome revenue per acre for the period since plant- 
ing. The removal of these gradually from the plantation as required by 
the progress of the other sorts would form, as it does now in other coun- 
tries, a nice scientific and practical study. The second class of trees in 
such a plantation should be of a less spreading habit and more of upright 
growth so as not to interfere too early with the first and third classes ; 
they should also begin to offer some revenue at thirty years, because the 
most of them would have to give place to the third or standard class, in 
about fifty years from the date of planting. In all well regulated plant- 
ing one set of trees is held as those to remain as long as good management, 
their own natural habits, and a proper time to harvest without loss, will 
allow. These are the third class referred to, and necessarily we desire a 
slower growth, a habit that will not spoil by close neighbourhood a 
sociable plant therefore, giving high value when cut, maturing late, hold- 
ing its maturity long, giving low branches and many leaves, a gatherer 
and holder of atmospheric moisture, a wind sifter, and holding electric 
communication with cloud and other trees at a distance. We have such 
trees of several varieties. 

The preparation of the land, detailed method of planting, distance 
apart of trees, including fencing, drainage, knowledge of enemies and 
friends in nature, and all the management throughout in order to attain 
the highest results are too much for my time on this occasion. 

The farmer's view of a wood, is grazing. Modern Arboriculture does 
not recommend it in Europe at any stage of growth, vet, with us in the 
more difficult maintenance of permanent pasture, I see no objection to the 
admission of sheep during the second, and cattle during the latt- cropping 
periods. 



448 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The duty of legislatures, in regard to existing woodlands, and replant- 
in^, is being pressed upon our attention from various quarters, and un- 
questionably ere long every progressive country must take some action. 
How much to do, and what not to interfere with, will make the bill. 
That the Ontario Government has a warm side to trees is well known, 
and it is to be hoped that whatever they do will be early, full, good, rapid 
and permanent. 

American Forestry will have no place in all its scientific and practical 
value until one of two things be accomplished : one is the conviction on 
the part of our farmers of the necessity of conserving and replanting, 
therefore their education up to these, and the other is the power by Gov- 
ernment to resume parts of the country for conserving and replanting. 
Both will be difficult ; the former would be the slower, but eventually 
the most thorough because of self-interest ; the latter would be more im- 
mediate and possibly less efficient practically, though scientifically better 
applied. No large number of various interests could be so well arranged 
as by a company, and therefore Government will have to become fores- 
ters in all the many details of the profession. Were a properly conducted 
system of forestry begun in 1884, the results would be so strong in the 
year 1900 as to astonish. It would possibly change much of our present 
agricultural practice ; it would certainly enhance the production of winter 
wheat to an immense extent ; it would enable us to graze nearly two for 
one by checking rapid evaporation and encouraging permanent pasture ; 
it would largely nullify droughts, perpetuate streams, and generally make 
climate more regular and reliable. 

To those acquainted with Arboriculture as a profession in all its na- 
tional bearings, an annual expenditure of $50,000 has in other countries 
made an annual crop revenue of 25,000 within fifteen years, in addition 
to the triple value of climatic amelioration.

$uitoing0 of the 




BEING there are so many kinds of farming ifc may reason- 
ably be assumed that, for their accommodation, there 
should be a corresponding diversity in the size and arrange- 
ment. But before explaining any general rule, and apply- 
ing it to construction, it is necessary, as a preliminary in- 
vestigation to ascertain the particulars which constitute 
the most proper site which the buildings of the farm should 
occupy. 

Were theory alone to determine the site of the steading, 
it would be at the centre, as being the point equidistant from the circunv- 
ference of a circular farm. But, for the sake of practice, farms cannot be 
laid out in the circular form. Farms are therefore laid out in the quad- 
rangular form, having straight sides, wherever practicable. The centre of 
such a quadrangle is the proper site for the buildings, and from its 
centre alone, it is obvious that a farm can be most economically con- 
ducted. 

Difficulties, however, of a physical nature often interfere with the 
choice of the centre as the most proper site. The centre may be very 
much elevated above the other parts, or it may be a low marsh or a lake 
In either case the building cannot be placed in the centre of the farm. 

When the farm contains both permanent, pastoral and low arable land, 
the building should be placed upon it, and at the centre of the arable 
portion, whether that be the centre of the farm or not. 

Convenience often decides the site of a steading. Command of water- 
power is a strong incentive to place it by the side of a river. But it is 
worthy of consideration at first, whether the river is capable of affording 
a constant supply of water throughout all the seasons. If it does, then 
the buildings will be economically placed near the river, though that may 
not be at the centre of the farm ; but if the water be deficient in quantity, 
if it affords a sufficiency only in winter, then it is more economical to 
place the building near the centre of the farm. 

A good road is a natural inducement to place the buildings beside it. 
But this advantage, natural as it is, may be purchased by the sacrifice of 



450 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

a creator. Should the buildings be placed, in consequence, at the extreme 
an^le of the farm, such a sacrifice would be made. We know several 
which are thus inconveniently placed, for the sake of a good road and the 
command'of water power ; but these advantages were obtained at the ad- 
ditional expense of maintaining extra labour to work the most distant 
fields of the farm. Better make a good farm road to the leading one from 
the centre of a farm, then place the buildings at its upmost corner. 

Good shelter induces the placing of buildings in it. A warm and com- 
fortable situation in winter conduces much to the well-being of all con- 
cerned. But this desideratum alone should not induce the placing of the 
building at a point whence the farm would have to be worked at increas- 
ed cost. 

A pleasant view from the farm-house may naturally induce the placing 
of a steading a short distance away from the centre of a farm. 

There are particular spots which should be avoided as sites for build- 
ings. A rocky knoll presents difficulties in making a foundation and 
cellar for buildings, and it is unsuited to proper drainage. Close to a river 
or lake, on a level with its banks, renders drainage impracticable, and 
should be avoided on account of the dampness of such a situation. A bed 
of dry loose sand is unsuitable for a secure foundation, though the diffi- 
culty might be overcome by artificial means. There is no necessity, how- 
ever of incurring an obviously unnecessary expense in forming a founda- 
tion for farm buildings. A clayey substratum in front of a rising ground 
is not an eligible position for a site, inasmuch as it will always retain 
dampness, whatever may be .the drainage. A very exposed spot in a gap 
between two hills, is an uncomfortable position both for man and beast. 
It is a question whether or not it is more economical to place the build- 
ings at the higher or lower part of an inclining arable farm. If situate at 
the higher part, all the produce of grain, turnips, and potatoes has to be 
carried up-hill; and if on the lower, the manure is subject to the same in 
convenience. Where the surface of a farm forms a round-backed ridge 
sloping both ways, the apex of the ridge is the most economical site, and 
the case is the same when the buildings are placed in the centre of a long 
slope of land. It should not be forgotten that loads have to be carried 
both to and from home, so that the high or low position will answer, pro- 
vided there be no steep ascent or descent immediately at the buildings. 
When both high and low situations are equally circumstanced, reason and 
experience would prefer the low. 

One essential consideration should be given to all sites, which is, whe- 
ther pump water is obtainable or not. Where it is abundant, some incon- 



THE BUILDINGS OF THE FARM. 

venience may be submitted to ; but if scanty, the most eligible site ought 
to be abandoned at once. 

It is desirable that the farm house should be situated so as to command 
a view of the fields of the farm, and also be near the barns; and if any 
sacrifice of position on the part of either is necessary, the house should 
give way to the other. 

Having thus pointed out the best position for the buildings to occupy 
on a farm, our next endeavour shall be to lay down the general principle 
which should guide in the construction for every variety of husbandry. 

Straw and roots being the most bulky articles in the buildings, and in 
great and daily use by all the stock, and having, though heavy and un- 
wieldly, to be distributed in every apartment by manual labour, it should, 
of necessity, be placed centrically, and at the shortest distance from the 
stock. Bearing the relations of these particulars in mind, it is obvious 
that they constitute the principle upon which the construction of farm 
buildings should be based ; and as the centre is the nearest point to the 
circumference it is also obvious that the original receptacle for the straw 
and roots should occupy the central point of the steading. There can be 
no exception to this rule for every variety of farming where straw and 
roots are in use. Every apartment occupied by stock should thus encir- 
cle the barn and cellars. Different classes and ages of stock require dif- 
ferent quantities and kinds of food, so that those which require the most 
should be placed nearest the barn ; and in all cases straw should be car- 
ried short distances, and not at all from any other apartment than direct 
from the straw-barn. 

We shall now endeavour to illustrate this principle in its application to 
all classes of farm buildings. Cattle fattening, whether in boxes or 
stables, requiring most food, should be placed nearest the straw -barn and 
cellar. Younger cattle, being lighter, require less food, and should be 
placed either at a greater distance from the straw-barn and cellar than 
the fattening cattle, or at the same distance on the other side of it. 
Horses and cows requiring the least straw, may be placed at the greatest 
distance from the straw. 

The leading principle involved in the above arrangement is comprehen- 
sive and simple, and is obviously applicable to every size and kind of 
barn. But indisputably correct as the principle is, it is very seldom 
adopted in practice; and we may safely assert that, the greater the 
deviation from it, the less commodious are the buildings as habitations 
for stock in winter. 



452 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

After all then that has been said, illustrated, acted upon, and written 
about farm buildings, there is but one way of putting them together, 
only one method of arrangement, and there cannot possibly be any other. 
I do not care what the kind of farming is whether grazing, dairy, or 
mixed, or in what part of the world it is followed there is but one prin- 
ciple to guide all. 

Take a case, applicable to us as Canadians, so that our explanations 
may be more easily understood. The first idea is : 

Centralization There is more expense, more labour, more waste, and 
greater risks in isolated buildings than in having them together. The 
risk of less damage by fire, when fire does occur, with separate buildings 
is true, but the contingency is too remote, or at least should be made so, 
and cannot outweigh the others named. 

One Covering. Following in strict agreement with centralization, we 
must have one covering for everything nothing whatever excepted not 
even the manure ; indeed, the manure in preference to some other things 
needs it more. Everything under one cover adds to comfort and econo- 
mizes labour, lessens weather influences cooler in summer, and warmer 
in winter, and ensures a profitable collection and distribution of rain- 
water. 

Storing of Food The true principle of storing is to store, not to scat- 
ter ; in this there is true economy of labour, economy of buildings, less 
waste, and particularly the being able to arrange the various animals

in centre ; an hospital for sick animals neither:; warm nor cold, nor with 
too much nor too little light, and drainage from all parts centering ia

THE BUILDINGS OF THE FAKM. 453 

Preparation of Food. Centralized as it is, with all the green fodder 
on a level with animals and all the dry fodder hay and straw in the 
barn overhead, its preparation for consumption is the next consideration. 
It matters not whether the food is machine prepared or not, the principle 
in the arrangement is not affected. Assume, however, for the sake of 
meeting most difficulties, that machinery is used. Steam or horse power 
will be necessary overhead, under cover, to drive straw cutter above, grain 
crusher below, and root pulper below. The lower machinery should ad- 
join one of the main passages for the sake of room, light, access with ma- 
terials, and near to the green fodder ; the cut dry fodder drops from above 
into an apartment beside the feed or mixing room. In the feed room ma- 
terials are prepared for distribution in whatever form is considered best, 
and, in order to assist this, as well as to be used for other purposes, the 
boil-house should be close at hand. 

Distribution of Food. Now comes the beauty of centralizing every- 
thing. With the feed-room now as our sub-centre, it is required to serve 
every animal rapidly, easily, without personal danger, and without leav- 
ing any food anywhere but in the proper place. In explaining the dis- 
tribution consider that the whole mass of buildings consists of three sec- 
tions : (1) The outside section containing some of the animals and all the 
dead materials ; (2) the middle section containing the remainder of the 
animals and all the prepared food ; and, (3) the inner section, which 
alone is the store. Between the first and second sections there is a pas- 
sage having on either side food access to every animal in tlie building. 
Rails and a hand-car or two, if required, in this passage completes the ar- 
rangement for distributing food, with the addition of two or three shoots 
from above to obtain hay and straw. 

Cleaning. The animals requiring daily removal of manure, that from 
tied-up animals not sheep, calves, or bulls necessarily, or at least pro- 
portionately less are arranged in strict accordance with economy of la- 
bour, and may be done by rail, by hand, or by barrow throwing the 
manure over the low fence that separates the pit from the railway. 

Wnter and Weighing. These should be central, and on the line of the 
great roads of the building,where waggon-loads, animals, or anvthin" else 
may be weighed, and all live stock drink undercover. There should also 
be a weighscale on the track opposite the feed-room, in order to check 
quantity given per head when necessary. 

Outside Courts. Any number and arrangement of these are simple, 
and would be required for poultry, sheep, and bulls. 



454 THE H ME > FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

Aspect. The way in which the building faces east, west, north, or 

south is important. Horses having to go to work early and return late, 
sunshine is not so material to their range as other animals that are housed 
all day, so, therefore, the implements and horses should have the northern 

aspect. 

Access to Barn. The large diameter of the building admits of an easy 
slope on one half of it, so that this access is under cover, and practically 
there need be no barn door of the present-day-style, and no opening ex- 
cept for ventilation. The slope of this roadway to barn will not interfere 
with any of the ground plan, and lands above to suit division of mows. 

pl an . The principles thus laid clown are illustrated on the accompany- 
in^ plans. I invite the most severe criticism upon their details. The cir- 
cular form is best adapted for such an illustration, but an octagon, an 
ellipse, or even a square would answer, though not so conveniently. 
There is no reason whatever why a circular building should not serve in 
actual practice ; the expense, I think, would be more. 

DESCEIPTION OF CIRCULAR FARM BUILDINGS. 

The principles of construction and arrangement have already been ex- 
plained, and though the plan and section are plain enough it may be ne- 
cessary to add some explanations. 

The size can, of course, be more or less, according to requirements ; in 
this example the diameter is 150 feet. The building is a complete circle, 
cut on the ground floor into quadrants by two cross-roads wide and high 
enough for a waggon load, and occupied at their intersection by a weigh- 
scale of the usual kind say three tons maximum. Across the 
diameter in any direction the ground floor is divided into nine parts 
that is a centre with four on each side. Entering at any of the 
four main doors, the first section is laid off for the lighter class of animals 
such as sheep, pigs, poultry, cows, and those required for labour, as horses. 
As a matter of convenience, the implements, manure and bulls are also in 
this section. Immediately adjoining this outer rim is the hand-car rail- 

way completely round the building, having no break whatever, and 

forming the second section. The third section is occupied by cattle of all 
kinds, except cows, one quadrant being devoted to fattening stock, and the 
other to young cattle ; another to calves, and the hospital ; and the fourth 
to food preparing arrangements, such as boil-house, feed-room, from which 
all prepared food is distributed by the hand-car. It will now be observed 
that every animal in the building can be supplied with food, at head, by 



THE BUILDINGS OF THE FARM. 455 

this circular railway ; that hay and straw from shoots above connect with 
the same, and can be taken to all parts right and left. A large part of 
the manure can also be taken to yard by car, in addition to water and any 
form of material. The fourth section is the root and feed stores, with 
water from a well for general use easily approached from all quarters. 
Light, if required at any particular point, may be secured easily, as shown 
in section ; ventilation is abundant with all the roads, and may be added 
to by over-head traps to any of the sections, as example at A on section of 
horse stable. The liquid from manure and all the stables is collected in 
tanks, so as to be entirely withdrawn or redistributed over the pile. Rain- 
water from the roof also is stored underground, to be utilized for any pur- 
pose. The entrance to the barn slopes from the ground level of outside 
wall to the centre being an easy ascent of one in five. The conduction 
of li^ht from the window dome is a special feature that, in a smaller 
building, may not be necessary, but here of importance, especially as it is 
of some practical value to form the intersection of the cross-roads where 
the weighscale stands into a show ring, where, for example, a purchaser 
can examine any animal on a wet day. This show ring could be extended 
to thirty-five feet in diameter. 

On landing in the barn from the sloping roadway, the horses and wag- 
gon can be driven all round between the mows there being a centre and 
one side mow, that can be made into many divisions. Two granaries take 
up part of the outside mows, and the space above all, right up to the roof, 
is ample for large quantities of hay and straw ; indeed, the waggon-way 
itself could, in a press, be utilized for storage. 

If it is imperative that the manufacturer should have extensive and 
skilfully designed buildings and machinery, it is equally necessary that 
the farmer who is determined to keep abreast of the times should have 
suits of farm buildings which will enable him to economise on all hands.

may seem unnecessary to inquire, in the present day, what 
drainage really is. Thousands upon thousands of dollars 
are being expended on draining operations, and one may 
therefore be disposed to say that, had the subject not been 
thoroughly understood, a check would have been put upon 
the expenditure long ere now. But though such an infer- 
ence as this may so far be justifiable, yet there are no good 
grounds for its being laid down and adhered to. I fear 
that, if the truth were told, it would be seen that drainage 
is not understood in the way it ought to be ; and, in consequence, consi- 
derable sums of money are being expended injudiciously in the carrying 
out of "this very important improvement. It is right that we should 
endeavour to find out the true meaning of the term drainage, in connec- 
tion with improving operations. We may consider this important under- 
taking in two aspects 1st, Negatively, in its preventing evil ; and, 2nd, 
Positively, in its effecting good. 

If the soil and sub-soil are charged with water to such an extent that 
the whole pores and interstices are full and overflowing, it is impossible 
that the crops grown upon it can have even a good yield. The evils en- 
tailed upon the soil by the presence of stagnant water are of various kinds. 
There is, first, a mechanical injury done to it. Its particles, when they 
happen to be clayey in their nature, are made to cohere so as to prevent 
the circulation of atmospheric air in its interior. In consequence it be- 
comes cold and sour, and is less easily wrought than it ought to be. Who 
has not seen an undrained clay field lying at seed -time in too wet a state 
to be sown, while all the drained land in the vicinity has been seeded in 



THE DRAINAGE OF THE FARM. 4.57 

a satisfactory manner, without feeling that great and permanent evil was 
being done to it ? That water does not stagnate in the soil without mak- 
ing it poorer and more unproductive than it would be were it lying in a 
dry state. Then, as the farmer is often compelled, by the advance of the 
season, to work his undrained land before it is nearly drv enough, the 

/ / 

pressure from the feet of the horses bakes it, and greatly reduces its per- 
meability. 

The soil, in this way, is injured mechanically as well as chemically, for 
stagnant water does a two-fold injury. Chemists tell us, that evapora- 
tion is productive of cold. Now, if a very large quantity of water is to 
be evaporated from the soil by the sun's rays, the temperature of the sur- 
face stratum will necessarily be considerably lowered. It takes as much 
heat to evaporate a cubic inch of water as would raise the temperature of 
5i inches from the freezing to the boiling point. To evaporate an inch of 
rainfall from an acre of land, requires an amount of heat from the sun, 
which would be sufficient to raise the temperature of the dry soil of a 
whole acre, to the depth of 10 inches, no less than 99 degrees. When we 
consider that upwards of 25 inches of rain-fall are evaporated in many 
parts during a year, the enormous importance of under-drainage, as a 
means of preventing the temperature of the soil from being lowered, can- 
not fail to be observed. A wet soil, which must become dry in spring 
mainly by a process of evaporation, will always be cold ; and the crops 
grown upon it will be later than if it were freed from its stagnant water 
by a system of under-drainage. Even the temperature of a district is 
considerably lowered by there being much evaporation from the soil. 
Hence the liability to injury from frosts, of those crops in late districts, 
that are grown in the vicinity of marshy land. 

It is well known, also, that while stagnant water is a bad conductor 
downwards of the heat which its surface receives from the sun's rays, it 
readily communicates cold to the soil lying underneath. The greater 
part of the heat which is absorbed by a badly drained soil is radiated into 
space in the night-time ; whereas in dry, well wrought land, much of it 
is stored up at a greater or less depth, and becomes useful afterwards in 
stimulating the growth of the produce. When there is stagnant water in 
the soil, there must be a development of acids, and compounds of various 
kinds, inimical to the health of the crops grown upon it. As new rain 
falls, and is mixed with the old water, a mutual decomposition and re- 
conversion of the compound substances present, is the natural consequence ; 
but as these mixtures are injurious to vegetable life, in a chemical sense, 
while the water itself is also hurtful to the land both chemically and me- 



458 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

chanically, the crop at the time is checked in growth, and its harvest 
yield is necessarily diminished. 

Such are a few of the evils entailed upon land by the presence of 
stagnant water. But thorough drainage, by its negative or preventa- 
tive action, does away with all these evils, and increases the fertility of 
the soil. 

The positive action of drainage is very varied in its nature. It pro- 
motes the aeration of the soil, and the circulation of rain water through its 
pores and interstitial canals. All the openings in the soil must be filled 
either with water or atmospheric air, and in displacing the former we in- 
troduce the latter. Now, in addition to nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, 
of which atmospheric air principally consists, it contains carbonic acid, 
nitric acid, carbonate of ammonia, and other gaseous compounds, intro- 
duced into it by natural and artificial exhalations. As these ingredients 
come into contact with the mineral matters of the soil, they change their 
nature either by a process of oxidation and consequent reduction, or by a 
direct union of elements so as to effect a true chemical decomposition. 
Here is a field of tenacious land, we shall suppose, which has been lying 
in a wet unprofitable state for a great many years. In consequence of 
atmospheric air being excluded from its interstices, both its mineral and 
vegetable constituents are lying in an inert useless state. But we drain 
it effectually, and by an immediate introduction of atmospheric air into 
the openings from which the water has been withdrawn, we set afoot a 
series of most important chemical transformations. The vegetable mat- 
ter absorbs oxygen from the air, and is gradually reduced to its elements. 
Some of the mineral bodies, such as those having a considerable quantity 
of iron in their texture, are likewise oxidized ; and instead of being any 
longer poisonous to cultivated plants, as they formerly were, they become 
perfectly harmless, if not even productive of good. Then, by the agency 
of rain water and air, there are many inorganic ingredients which are 
slowly disintegrated, and their elements fitted to take part in the building 
up of vegetable structures. We have here a very obvious explanation how 
it is that wet land, rich in vegetable and mineral substances, is usually 
very productive for several years after being drained. Its constituents 
begin at once to exert an influence on growing plants ; and hence, if 
the land be under the control of a farmer who is desirous rather to take 
from than to give to it, he has the power of robbing it to an enormous 
extent. 

Rain water is one of our best natural fertilizers ; and any mode of treat- 
ing the soil, calculated to promote its porcolation through its pores, must 



THE DRAINAGE OF THE FARM. 459 

be attended with great advantages. Even pure water is of much value, 
in conveying the elements of fertility to the roots of plants ; but rain 
water contains ingredients which make it valuable as a direct fertilizer. 
It should not be looked upon as a nuisance, therefore, which cannot be 
too speedily got rid of, but rather as an enricher of the soil, through the 
mass of which it ought to percolate slowly, in order that its useful parts 
may be completely extracted. There are considerable differences of opi- 
nion amongst scientific men in regard to the qualities of the various en- 
riching substances that are usually to be found in rain water ; but all 
agree that it contains some ammonia and nitric acid, as well as other mat- 
ters of less practical importance. Now, in a properly drained soil, full 
advantage is taken of these ingredients, in impregnating the particles, and 
increasing their effects in promoting the growth of plants. Indeed, there 
can be no fertility without rain water ; and its beneficial action upon the 
soil and subsoil is only to be obtained by systematic drainage. " The 
introduction of water to a soil," says Liebig, " is, properly speaking, an 
introduction of alkalies." And so it is; for, on well-drained land, rain 
water is unquestionably a liquid manure. But it is not merely in its di- 
rect manurial and decomposing effects on the soil, that we must look on 
rain water as a valuable fertilizer. It carrries heat into the ground, and 
thus the land becomes warmer and earlier than it was before. It also 
washes out noxious substances, and carries them into the drain-channels^ 
or leaves them harmless in the ground. 

The power of soils to absorb moisture, in the form of dew or aqueous 
vapour, is greatly increased by a complete system of under-drainage being 
carried out. And there can be no question whatever, that the land which 
absorbs most moisture from the atmosphere, is usually the best adapted 
for the production of crops. " The power of soils to absorb water from 
the air," says Sir Humphrey Davy, "is much connected with fertility. 
When this power is great, the plant is supplied with moisture in dry sea- 
sons ; and the effect of evaporation in the day is counteracted by the ab- 
sorption of aqueous vapour from the atmosphere, by the interior parts of 
the soil, during the day, and by both the exterior and interior during the 
night." It is only these soils, of course, that are finely comminuted to a 
considerable depth, that absorb the largest quantity of moisture ; and hence 
the necessity for under-draining being followed up by a deep and thorough 
system of cultivation. 

We see, therefore, that, in inquiring what drainage really is, we discover 
that it is an operation upon the soil, calculated to remove superfluous 
water, to the depth of the stratum in which the roots of cultivated plants 



460 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

are likely to ramify. When we endeavonr to ascertain what it actually 
does, it becomes obvious that it is an improvement which, if properly car- 
ried out, will both prevent evil from being done to the soil, and prove a 
carrier of fertilizing substances into it, through the instrumentality of rain 
water and atmospheric air. 

COMMENCING DRAINAGE WORKS. 

As a preliminary to its being brought into a maximum state of fertility, 
every kind of bibulous soil requires to be thoroughly drained ; and, with 
clays, drainage is, in all cases, an absolute necessity. Even on soils that 
are comparatively porous, great errors have been committed in forming 
drains at too wide intervals ; and, in heavy land, the mistake, if fallen in- 
to, is immensely greater. For the sake of an ill-judged economy, we are, 
in many cases, tempted to put in drains at great distances apart, believing 
that depth will compensate for width. Than this, there can be no greater 
mistake ; and, however carefully it should be avoided in soils of medium 
quality, it ought to be still more so in strong clays. So great is the af- 
finity for water evinced by heavy land, that it requires the drains to be 
placed at very frequent intervals, in order to its being made sufficiently 
dry, and capable of being profitably cultivated, The depth of the drains, 
on such soils, is a matter of less consequence than their distance apart ; 
but there are, notwithstanding, various theoretical considerations which 
go to prove the value of deep over shallow drainage, even in the strongest 
clays. In a dense, unctuous soil, the pores and interstitial canals are of 
much smaller sectional area than those of light land ; and hence, in the 
former, a greater perpendicular weight of water is necessary to overcome 
capillary resistance, than is required in the latter. 

I have said, that so bibulous are ordinary clays, that it is only by 
drains placed very closely together, that completely effective drainage can 
be secured. I do not refer to the clay of any particular geological forma- 
tion, but to all heavy land containing more than 30 per cent, of pure clay, 
so called, and less than 5 per cent, of lime. Any one acquainted with the 
drainage systems which have been adopted in past years must be satisfied 
that a very small part of the strong clays that have been drained, have, in 
reality, been effectively dried. They have, in too many instances, been 
brought into that tough, soured state that half-drained, heavy land as 
sumes ; and are, therefore, not only ill to work, but when under green 
crops, are, in wet seasons, far from being so productive as they ought to be. 
But this is an evil that may surely be -avoided; and, though the cost of 



THE DEAIXAGE OF THE FARM. 461 

draining clays, in a satisfactory manner, should be more than the rates 
commonly thought of, the question of ultimate profit is the principal one 
to take into consideration. Clays are intrinsically of greater value than 
light soils ; and, though the expense of gaining access to their organic in- 
wredients is greater in the former than in the latter, yet they are worth all 
the additional outlay. 

DRAINAGE OUTLETS. 

In commencing drainage operations on any kind of land, the very first 
thing requiring attention is the improvement of the main water-courses 
into which the covered rfutfalls are to be discharged. If a sluggish river or 
a dead-level ditch, half-grown up with rank vegetation, is to be left undeep- 
ened when adjoining fields are being drained, then the probability is, that 
the outlets which are now formed but a few inches above the level of these 
imperfect water-ways, will, in a few years, not only be grown up, but 
back-water will injure the whole inland operations to such an extent, that 
the drains will cease to be any longer effective. Though " prevention better 
than cure " may seem a very trite motto, yet it really ought to be more 
attended to, in its practical application, to the carrying out of drainage 
works, than it usually is by improvers. The whole value of the outlay- 
on draining will frequently be found to hinge on the completeness of the 
river and ditch outfalls as actual discharging water-channels. What- 
ever the really necessary expenditure may be, it is unquestionably a mat- 
ter of the first importance that means should be adopted, to clean out ami 
straighten crooked water-ways, and, if at all possible, add to their dis- 
charging capacity, by increasing the descent of the channel, which is to be 
specially relied on. 

There are some kinds of undrained land, however, which, though not 
situated on the banks of a river, can yet be drained propei'ly only by the 
application of a great amount of skill and expense in the formation of 
suitable outfalls. Take some of the flat-lying land in Ontario ; and just 
consider, for a moment, how impossible it is to drain them either three or 
four feet deep, unless some extraordinary expensive provision is made for 
the securing of a proper outlet. It is no uncommon thing to see a sheet 
of really good land, extending to many square miles, which seems to be 
so dead flat and completely water-logged, that it is next to impossible to 
drain it. But the impossibility is only imaginary after all. It is a mere 
question of skilful application of means, that is necessary to dispel the 
phantom. There is no land in the world so perfectly flat, that water 
not run away from it in properly cut channels. There may be spots 



402 THE HOME, FAEM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

that are perfectly dead level ; but the fall on contiguous pieces of ground, 
if taken advantage of, is generally sufficient to make water run. The 
plan to adopt, therefore, in draining long level flats of country, is, to <*o 
far enough down the descent, and bring up a main level, so accurately cut 
that no fall has been lost. This will, in most instances, give the required 
facilities for getting rid of the water discharged by the under drains 
which must then be formed. I may be told that this will be costly. 
And so it will ; but in those districts where the value of the soil is kept 
at a very low figure, when it might soon be largely increased by the re- 
moval of stagnant water, the question of expense, or mutual arrangement 
between neighbouring farmers in respect thereto, is not the primary one. 
Only convince the owner of such land that it is quite possible to drain it, 
and he will soon find out that the improvement can be effected, so as to 
leave him ultimately a good profit on the undertaking. 

At all times, the aim in carrying out drainage works should be to give 
at the first deep and suitable outfalls ; and afterwards, too much care can 
scarcely be exercised in keeping the open ditches and outlets free from 
impediment of every sort. Once let the chief outfall become gorged or 
ineffective, and, of necessity, the whole drainage works are likely tosuffer 
damage. 

DEPTH AND DISTANCES APART OF DRAINS. 

We have yet to find out how deep and how far apart the drains require to 
be in ordinary cases, to afford complete drainage. It is difficult to deter- 
mine how deep the roots of most species of our cultivated plants will go, 
if unobstructed by noxious water or impenetrable layers of clay. Ex- 
perience has proved that the roots of cereals and clovers will descend at 
least three feet into a porous good subsoil, and mangold -wurzel extends 
its fibres to a distance of four or five feet in all directions. There is, there- 
fore, no exaggeration in taking three feet as the depth to which all culti- 
vated soils should be dried. If it is supposed that drains three feet deep 
will be sufficient to secure this end, the sooner the impression is given up 
the better. In all cases, the law of capillary attraction comes into opera- 
tion, and limits the action of the drains by at least six or eight inches. 
When one puts the edge of a piece of blotting paper into water, the effect 
of this attraction or imbibition is very well seen. Now, in the soil the 
same process goes on, only the earth and clay are less bibulous than the 
paper, and draw up the moisture to a comparatively limited extent. The 
same law may be observed in operation when we fill a series of small 
tubes with water. In the tubes which have the largest calibre say that 



THE DRAINAGE OF THE FARM. 403 

they are half an inch in diameter the water -will be observed to have a 
Jitly concave surface, that on the outer edges being attracted up the 
sides of the glass a little. With tubes much smaller, this peculiarity will 
be still more distinctly seen ; and with those that have so small internal 
openings, that they only admit a fine wire, it will be found that the water 
will not even run through them, if they are in short length. The whole 
opening is charged with liquid ; but, in consequence of the attracting or 
retaining power of the glass walls, it is in a state of rest ; and to overcome 
this vis inertia' by natural means, we require to add pressure from above, 
by increasing the length of the tube, and filling it to the surface. From 
the nature of the air canals which exist in the soil, we are justified in 
comparing them to an extensive series of vertical and crooked or diagon- 
ally arranged tubes bundled together, with their mouths at the surface 
and their exit openings a little above the level of the drainage channels. 
If the drains are shallow, these tubes must of course be short ; and 
the head pressure being less than if they were long, they will necessarily 
evacuate the water more slowly than if they were longer. This theory is 
completely borne out by practical observation ; for, in most cases (other 
circumstances being equal), deep drains run sooner and faster after rain 
than shallow ones. And, as the pores or tubes of dense soils are more 
minute than those of light or open land, and will therefore require to have 
increased head pressure to promote the free circulation of water, the theo- 
retical reason comes out, how it is that drains require to be deeper in 
clayey ground than in any other kind of soil. 

We often meet with practical farmers who assert that, if four-feek 
drains are adopted on heavy soils, the rain water falling upon the surface 
will fail to reach them. They suppose that most clays are so impervious 
that water cannot percolate through a stratum four feet thick. Now, I 
admit at once, that there are clays to be found, which are so plastic and so 
dense when trodden upon or pressed in any way, that even an inch in 
thickness will hald a pool of water for a considerable time. I have seen a 
quantity of water standing in a clay furrow for weeks together, with an 
excellent pipe-tile drain underneath, having only six inches of cover. 
Not a drop found its way into the drain from the pool above ; and, had 
there been a layer of clay but two inches thick, I believe the result would 
have been the same. What inference, then, are we to draw from this 
fact ? Are we to argue that drains six inches deep are not shallow enongh 
to permit the free percolation or water from the surface of dense clays ? 
If six-inch drains are too deep in some cases, what other depth can we 
make them, to insure their efficiency ? We see at once, therefore, that, if 



4G4 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

we object to deep drains in clays, simply because the water will not get 
down to them ; the objection applies eqally to shallow drainage. 

There can be no necessity for denying the fact, that neither shallow nor 
deep drains will work well at the first in strong clays, if the surface has 
been much wrought upon; and that even in any case, deep drains will 
not become Affective quite so soon as shallow drains will. The pores and 
interstices of the soil which have hitherto been filled with stagnant water 
must be emptied, and the land acted upon both by frosts and drought, ere 
the percolation is fairly begun. There are many cases in which the deep 
drainer, applying his principles to the dense clays, is disappointed to find 
the drainage less complete for a time than he had been led to expect. He 
is consequently sorely tempted, at times, to come to the conclusion, that 
deep drains will not work in the clays at all ; and he is, therefore, inclined 
to revert to the shallow draining system. Now, there are several causes 
why deep drains fail at first to lay clay soils quite so dry as they ought to 
be. Perhaps they have been put in at a wet time of the season, and the 
material filled in above the pipes being little else than mud, it may be 
years before the weather has much effect in making it become porous. 
We have elsewhere pointed out the necessity for drains being formed 
when the soil is tolerably dry ; but, if this cannot be attained, care should 
at least be taken to keep the covering of as dry material as it is possible 
to obtain. But the defective action of deep drains may also be the result 
of unskilful management. The fact requires to be kept constantly in view, 
that water cannot flow right and left towards the pipes on a truly hori- 
zontal plane. It is along a sloping line that it must gravitate in the direc- 
tion of the drain ; and, if the soil is very dense, the fall upon this line 
must be greater than it would require to be in porous land. If we put in 
drains at too wide intervals, these oblique water lines may come to the 
surface without crossing or meeting each other, and hence the reason why, 
in some cases, where the soil is imperfectly drained, a wet strip is seen half 
way between the drains. It should also be remembered that land usually 
subsides considerably after being drained, and consequently those which 
are put in 4 feet deep this year, will not be more than 3 feet 8 inches 
deep five years hence, and will, perhaps, be even 3 or 4 inches shallower 
in other five years. This partly arises, no doubt, from the surface soil 
being carried off by water, and by the crops that have been grown, but 
the subsidence of the land is the main cause of the alteration. There may, 
however, be another agency at work. Everyone knows that lime, and 
other bodies that are heavier than soil, have a tendency to sink when 
placed upon the surface. And if we apply the principle conversely, we

may find that drain pipes filled with air, being lighter than soil, will have 
a tendency to rise towards the surface. Whatever the cause may be, the 
fact requires no proof, that after ten or twelve years, drains are found to 
be 6 or 7 inches shallower than when they were formed. And as drain- 
age is generally intended to be a permanent improvement ; as deep drains 
permit a greater depth of soil and subsoil to be exposed to the action of 
the air than is possible with shallow drainage; and as a much deeper and 
more effective system of cultivation than that presently in use is advis- 
able in many instances ; from all of these reasons, as well as others that 
might be stated, I hold that drains should be made as nearly 4 feet deep 
as possible. 

There are various circumstances, no doubt, which ought to modifj- in 
practice any general rule of this kind. Perhaps it is impossible, except at 
an enormous expense, to get an outfall sufficiently deep to admit of the 
drains being made 4 feet. And, in other cases, an immediate return on a 
very moderate outlay may be wished ; and for this purpose, shallow or 
30-inch drains will be preferable. In some instances, particularly in very 
dense tenacious soils, it may be advisable to put in only 3i feet drains. 
The drainage lines must be kept so near to each other, in order to lay land 
of this kind dry, that the workmanship connected with 4 feet drains be- 
comes very heavy by the acre. To obviate this evil, there is no alternative 
but that of reducing the depth, and bringing the drains a little closer 
together. If this is done in a skilful way, the drainage will prove per- 
fectly effective, though scarcely so complete as it would have been with 4 
feet drains having the same, or very little greater, distances between 
them. 

Far greater errors have been committed in regard to the distances apart 
of drains than as respects their depth, 

Rules applicable to every case cannot be laid down ; but I can state 
general principles, in reference to the distances at which drains should be 
placed in soils having specific characters. In very close clays, for ex- 
ample, 4-feet drains should be from 18 to 25 feet apart. If the depth is 
reduced by G inches, 18 to 21 feet will be wide enough. Then, on more 
porous though still rather tenacious land, 25 to 30 feet intervals do very 
well, when the depth is four feet ; and on very porous soils, 40 to 50 feet, 
and even still greater widths, will be sufficient. In many instances, a few 
well-directed drains will remove the injurious spring or pent-up waters 
from a large extent of land. The piece of ground to be operated upon in 
this special way, mostly requires a careful inspection, and to be treated ac-

cording to the peculiarities it may present ; so that it is scarcely possible 
to give a rule invariably correct when applied to practice. 



MAIN DRAINS. 



Having ascertained what depth and distances asunder the ordinary sur- 
face-water under-drains in any particular field ought to be, the carrying 
out of the works will next demand attention. In laying down the main 
and furrow drain lines a levelling instrument should always be used, if 
there is the slightest doubt about there being a good declivity on the 
surface. This is more particularly necessary in the formation of the 
outfalls. In very flat ground, it is sometimes a most difficult matter to get 
sufficient declivity to insure a self-cleansing action. As the usefulness of 
most drainage works depends very largely on the proper formation of the 
discharging outlets, no reasonable amount of expense should be spared in 
making" these as complete as possible. If they are to^be open, the 
sides of the cutting should be formed at an angle of 45 ; and if the 
material is very liable to slip, an angle of 40, or even less, will 
be sufficiently steep. All the excavated soil should be thrown well 
back from the edges, as it will have a tendency, if left too near, to 
make the sides give way. When the cutting is too deep to be left open, 
horse-shoe tiles, or circular pipes of large calibre, should be laid in it It 
is rarely advisable to lay several open tiles abreast or atop, as the sides 
obstruct the water, and silt is deposited, with considerable injury to the 
drain. To save a little expense many drainers commit the serious mistake 
of not going far enough down the fall to secure a deep and effective outlet ; 
and othersput in pipes that are much too small for the work they have 
to perform. 

It requires some skill to arrange the main drains in a f 
catch every hollow in it, without adding considerably to the cost ; and it 
also needs much care to keep the levels properly, in cutting the drains. 
When the main drains are very long, they should have overflow branches 
at various points. Suppose, for example, a drain four feet deep runs par- 
allel with an open ditch which is fully three feet in depth, then it is obvi- 
ous that, if a few branches be carried into the latter, the pressure on the 
main durin^ great floods, supposing it incapable of venting the water, will 
never be more than from a foot to a foot and a half. This can only be done, 
of course, when there is an open ditch, into which the overflow branch 
may be carried. At important junctions, and in places where there are 
sharp curves, there should also be sediment wells in the main drains, each 



THE DRAIXAGE OF THE FARM. 

covered by a stone placed far enough below the surface to be out of reach 
of the plough. All important discharging vents should be provided with 
.stone or cast-iron ends, and light gratings or a wooden box, in districts 
subject to extreme frosts, the ordinary tile being liable to crumble 
away. Each outlet should be numbered and registered in the regular 
drainage book of the farm. How often do we see the mouths of main 
' 1 rains laid into open, imperfectly cleaned ditches and no means being 
taken to mark their positions, they are soon overgrown, and, perhaps, stop* 
]"(.! up altogether. 

If the mam drain discharges itself into an open ditch, there ought to be 
a drop of from nine to twelve inches ; and, in every case where it is possible 
to obtain it, the main should be four to six inches deeper than the side 
drains. The latter ought to join the former, not exactly at right angles, 
but with a slight turn in the direction of the fall. And the workman 
who lays the pipes, should be most careful to cut a large enough opening 
in the main to vent all the water discharged by each side-drain, and then 
t<> pack the joint all round with stone chips. 

LATERAL, SIDE, OR FURROW DRAINS. 

In laying out the side drains, in lands which can only be dried by the 
parallel system of drainage, there are certain general rules which require 
to be observed. If the ground is lying in narrow, round-backed ridges, it 
may save considerable cutting to put a drain into each furrow. But, 'in 
many cases, there will be no saving effected, in the aggregate, by adopting 
this plan. More pipes will be required to drain an acre, than would be 
necessary with the drains placed at regular intervals; and hence the 
amount saved on the cutting is lost on the material. It is the duty of the 
person who gives advice in regard to the operations, to estimate the com- 
parative cost, under each system ; and, keeping both cheapness and effi- 
ciency in view, he ought to act according to the best of his judgment. In 
general, it will be found advisable to pay very little attention to the old 
furrows. Let the drains be laid off at regular intervals, to suit the nature 
of the soil, and carried through either ridges or furrows, as they may come 
in the way. The fact ought always to be kept in view, however, that, with 
this mode of draining, it is necessary subsequently to combine a levelling 
process of the soil. Rain-water should not be allowed to run along the 
surface of the ground, and descend immediately above the pipes. Where- 
ever it falls, there it ought to descend, and then find its way laterally to 
the drain channel on either side. On well-drained land, there ought to be 



468 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

no high ridges, with deep, open furrows between. The surface should be 
nearly level. Though, in one respect, it is a matter of very little impor- 
tance whether drain-lines are straight or crooked, yet, in another light, it 
is advisable that they should be as free as possible from bends. When a 
a plan of the drains is kept, and on every well-managed farm, the 
drains will be accurately mapped it is a very simple matter to find out 
any part of a straight drain that may have gone wrong, by merely running 
a line between any two points of it. Now, in a crooked or badly laid 
out drain, this is not so easily done ; and, as it does not add to the expense 
of the workmanship, there can be no objections to a straight line being 
preferred. It is well, also, in cutting the drains, to keep the face as to 
slope, the same on both sides. If one side is cut so as to overhang the 
drain, the chances are, that, if the soil is slippery in its nature, and the 
weather wet, it will give way, and fall in. And, besides, it is always ad- 
visable to lay down a standard of excellence for the guidance of the work- 
rnen.and encourage them to aim at reaching that standard. Inferior drainers 
are generally as defective in the formation of the bottom of the drain, as 
in the cutting of any other part of it. In all cases, the bottom should be 
the exact width of the pipe to be laid in it ; but very often it is far wider 
than it ought to be. The result is, that the pipes roll about too much, and, 
of necessity, collars must be used in order to keep them in line. Surely it 
would be much better to make the solid soil act as a collar ; and this end is 
completely attained by keeping the bottom the exact size of the pipe. 
Should the subsoil be too hard to admit of a narrow neat bottom being 
formed, then the pipes may easily be kept in line by carefully packing 
the sides with bits of clay or stone. 

In flat lands, the efficiency of the drains depends very much on the 
accuracy with which the levels are kept. There should be no pools of 
water in the bottom of a drain. The workman ought to be such an adept 
in the use of the cleaning tools, that the bottom, if even very nearly dead 
level, may have no standing water in it. A great many drainers can 
judge very accurately in regard to levels simply by the eye ; but a far 
greater number are altogether deceived by it. Hence the reason why the 
drainage engineer meets so frequently with workmen who will persist in 
affirming that there is no declivity upon the land, and that, in conse- 
quence, they cannot get the drains to the depth, while, all the time, it is 
merely their judgment that is at fault. This is frequently very simply 
proved, by making a little dam in the bottom of the drain, and showing 
that, before the water has extended a certain number of feet along the 
channel, it has overrun a bank of so many inches, representing the fall in 



THE DRAIXAGE OF THE FARM. 

that distance ; hence, one of the best guides in cutting a drain is to observe 
whether or not the water (when of course there is any), leaves you as t!' 
work progresses. 

The kind of draining materials to be used, must depend very much on 
the comparative prices at which they can be obtained in the district; but, 
other things being equal, circular pipes inside are preferable to any other 
kind. As the water runs in a contracted channel, there is less chance of 
a pipe-drain being choked by the deposition of sediment, than there is in 
the case of horseshoe-shaped or flat-bottomed tiles, in which the water is 
so much spread that it has not the power of washing away a deposit. The 
sizes of the pipes should be determined according to the estimated dis- 
charge from any particular field about to be drained. In long drains a 
larger sized pipe should be laid at the lower than at the upper ends. For 
150 yards, at the highest part of each drain, H-inch pipes will be found 
suitable ; but, if there is likely to be much water, 2 and 3-inch pipes are 
small enough for the principal parts of the drain. Wherever the bottom 
is soft or uneven, it will be advisable to use collars ; and in that way, a 
smaller sized pipe will do than if there were no collaring only it is cer- 
tainly advisable, as I have already said, to make the soil collar the pipe, 
in all cases where this may be practicable. 

Care should be taken to lay the pipes as soon as possible after the 
drain is cut. The bottom is liable to become soft, and be more or less cov- 
ered with mud, if there is any considerable delay. In putting in the 
pipes, it is advisable, in wet weather, to keep closely up to the drain- 
cutter ; and the laying work must be done by day's wages, and not by 
contract. No drain ought to be laid tiU the owner is satisfied that it is 
rightly formed ; and, after the pipes are put in, he must inspect them very 
carefully before the filling is commenced. Should he, in making this 
inspection, observe any open joints in the tiles, he should lay a small piece 
of stone upon it. 

^ There are various modes of filling the drains in use in different districts. 
Some persons will allow nothing but a paring of the surface sward to be 
laid next the pipes ; others prefer broken stones, or gravel ; and a third 
class consider clay the best of all coverings. In respect to the use of sur- 
face soil, it may only be remarked that, as it is a dirtier substance than 
clay, and fouls water much more than it does, it is not a suitable covering. 
Water, in passing through it, is likely to carry more injurious matter into 
the pipe-tile beneath, than would be the case were there a clay covering 
The loss resulting from the removal of the soil from the surface is not 
inconsiderable ; and, besides, water does not percolate so readily through 



470 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

it as it would through the ordinary kinds of bottom clay. A layer of 
broken stones, or any other porous material, over the pipeage, is not to 
be recommended, when only surface water is to be got quit of. It is 
imagined by some persons, that such a covering facilitates the admission 
of water into the drain ; and so it does, no doubt, but there is little advan- 
tage in this. I have said already, that water should be allowed to perco- 
late slowly towards the drains, that thereby its fertilizing ingredients may 
be thoroughly extracted. But, if the water once finds a way amongst 
these stones, it will run along the surface, and descend in little streams, 
each of which will carry more or less earthy matter into the drain. In 
practice, ifc has often been found that, in strong subsoils, the interstices of 
stones or gravel, employed in this way, were soon silted up, and, in conse- 
quence, the covering became more dense even than it would have been 
had it consisted only of clay. Perhaps, the best covering that can be used, 
is one formed from bottom clay, where that can be obtained. If the sub- 
soil is soft, the work may be done in this manner. A man, with a sharp, 
light digging spade, begins at one end of the newly laid drain, and pares 
off a slice of clay a few inches above the pipe, first on the one side and then 
on the other. As the one slice overlaps the other a little, and the lower 
ends are not completely severed from the side, but only broken down, as if 
hinged to it, a solid roof of about 1^ inches in thickness, is provided. 
During this operation the man walks on the top of the paring, and gives 
it, all along, such a pressure with the feet as his weight affords, but 
nothing more. Besides providing an excellent shoulder over the pipe, on 
either side, this roofing acts as a filter, and prevents the entrance of mud. 
When the clay is too hard to be cut with the spade, it is just as well, per- 
haps, to lay a row of the more solid bottom pieces on the top of the pipes, 
and some fine material over it. But, indeed, if the clay is filled in just as 
it comes out of the drain, it will do quite well, if no large voids are left. 
Some saving may often be effected by employing the plough, to assist in 
the filling operations. A large wooden mould-board should be fitted on 
for the purpose ; and, by using a long double-tree, one horse may walk on 
the one side of the drain, and the other on the other. 

On the completion of every kind of drainage works, means should at 
once be taken to have the lines of drains all accurately laid down upon a 
plan, having a scale of not less than 100 feet to the inch. The plans con- 
nected with each farm ought to be bound up as a book of reference. By 
having alternately a leaf of drawing paper, on which the drain lines are 
delineated in strong blue, and a leaf of writing-paper containing all neces- 
sary particulars. 



THE DRAINAGE OF THE FARM. 471 



PRACTICAL BENEFITS DUE TO LAND DRAINAGE. 

Let us summarise the foregoing with a few notes for more convenient 
reference : 

It has been shown that, so far from robbing the soil of that indispen- 
sable substance, water, the benefit of drainage is due to the complete reali- 
alization of the rainfall. The practical advantages which naturally 
spring out of the explanations already given will be almost antici- 
pated. Taking the case of a soil in which the stagnant condition of 
the water has been converted 'into a condition of movement, it will be 
found that the following substantial advantages are reaped. 

1. An earlier Harvest. In some cases drainage has made a difference 
of a fortnight in the ripening of crops. An early harvest is certainly an 
advantage, especially in the northern districts, where a late harvest is apt 
to be interrupted by bad weather, and I am sure that the season of 1883 in 
Ontario will mark an era in drainage operations, because much rain com- 
pletely prevented cropping on undrained farms, while those adjoining that 
were underdrained and comparatively unharmed. An early harvest also 
gives facilities for autumn cultivation. 

2. A more abundant Harvest. This is a general result of land drainage. 
In some cases the entire yield may be said to be due to the operation. 
Where ordinary tillage lands have been well drained, the advantage has, 
in many cases, been estimated at 8 bushels of wheat per acre. 

3. A better quality of Produce. A- more wholesome condition of soil 
naturally causes a more perfect development of the plant. Thus longer 
straw and better filled ears are only what might be expected. The plant 
is better able to resist the insidious attacks of disease, and does not so 
readily fall a victim to mildew, rust, and other fungoid attacks, commonly 
known as " blights." 

4. A greater variety of Crops. On undrained soils, and especially on 
wet clays, the farmer rarely ventures upon sowing a large variety of crops. 
He is compelled to allow a proportion of his land to lie idle as " bare 
fallow." After thorough drainage, the same land'may be made to grow a 
much larger variety of cultivated plants, such as roots, besides the cereals. 
and a much better and surer plant of clover. It must not, however, be 
thought that the character of the land is entirely changed by drainage. 
It is altered and improved ; but a clay soil will always be critical to man- 
age even after thorough drainage, and the degree of improvement will be 
found to be very various. 



472 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

5. Tilling rendered easier and less expensive. This is an important 
advantage, springing naturally out of the explanations already given. It 
is also due to the increase in the number of working days during the 
year upon drained land. On wet clay soils the farmer must wait for his 
land to dry. Nothing is more injurious than to attempt to work clay 
land when wet, and the time so spent is considered to be worse than 
wasted. Since drainage greatly shortens the period required to dry land, 
the number of working days throughout the year is considerably increased, 
and that strain upon the horses of the farm, so common at favourable 
seasons upon clay lands, is avoided. Either, then, fewer horses will be 
required, or those which are kept will be maintained in working condition 
at less cost. 

6. Applications of Manure more effective. There can be no greater 
mistake than that of applying fertilisers, in any form whatsoever, to wet 
land, and this is one of the best reasons for insisting upon thorough drain- 
age a first step towards improvement. Neither oil-cake given to live 
stock, gypsum applied to the land, or top-dressing distributed over grow- 
ing crops, will yield satisfactory results upon undrained wet soils, but 
after drainage all these means may be used with advantage. 

7. Health of Live Stock improved. Certain diseases are constantly 
associated with the presence of stagnant water. Although it would 
scarcely be correct to speak of stagnant water as directly causing black- 
leg and red- water among cattle, or " rot " among sheep, yet there can be 
no doubt that a wet condition of soil induces the presence of the active 
causes of these diseases, and that thorough drainage tends to extirpate 
them. 

8. The health of the rural population has also been greatly improved 
in many districts where drainage works have been carried out on a large 
scale, and this alone is a sufficient reason for viewing the operation as of 
national importance. 

1. Removes surperfluous water. 

2. Allows free access of air. 

3. Makes available materials, that were formerly useless. 

4. Destroys injurious substances. 

5. Saves time and labour. 

6. Saves seed. 

7. Pulverises and cleans. 

8. Quickens the action of manures. 

9. Hastens harvest.

^taking of Jfarm-jmri Alanure. 



FARM-YARD manure not only is unrivalled in composition,, 
but its value is enhanced by its action on the soil during 
its decay. No other manure exerts such a powerful chemi- 
cal and mechanical effect, and no other can be applied to 
all sorts of land with such positive certainty of effect. It 
is also found to be particularly durable in its effects, and 
these merits are quite sufficient to account for the high 
estimation in which dung is held by the farmer. 

GENERAL AND SPECIAL MANURES. The terms " general " 
and " special " are applied to manures according to the degree in which 
they are capable of thoroughly keeping up the fertility of land. A field 
from which the constituents of wheat, wool, bone, and milk, are being 
perpetually drained, can only be kept up in condition by the return of 
these in some other form. Any substance which can repair the entire 
loss is entitled to be called a general manure, just as milk, which is well 
known to repair all waste, and at the same time supply all the neeessary 
materials for building up the animal body, is spoken of as a " general 
food." 

The best type of a general manure is rich farmyard dung. Such dung- 
consists, first, of the excrements and urine of animals fed liberally upon 
roots, hay, and probably corn and cake. These voidings are rich in all the 
ash-constituents of plants as well as nitrogen. In addition, there is straw 
in abundance, so that well mixed and made farmyard manure, contains all 
the elements of both grain and straw, and is therefore well calculated to 
give back to a field what it has lost in the ordinary course of husbandry. 



THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Chemical study further confirms this view, and shows that this popular 
manure stands forward prominently as a true " general manure." 

These remarks sufficiently show the importance of farmyard manure. 
It is, however, well known to all practical men, that under the term dung, 
or farmyard manure, much comparatively worthless material may be 
included. The quality of dung depends upon a considerable number of 
circumstances, which may be thus enumerated : 

1. Upon the species of animal producing it. 

2. Upon the age and condition of the animal. 

3. Upon the food of the animal. 

4. Upon the accommodation of the animal. 

5. Upon the amount and quality of the litter supplied. 

6. Upon the management during its accumulation. 

7. Upon its after-treatment. 

The domestic animals which furnish the farmer with the most valuable 
portion of his manure-heap are cattle, horses, and pigs, and in rarer cases 
sheep. The dung of cattle forms the staple. It is generally of a somewhat 
thin and watery consistency, and is consequently not likely to heat rap- 
idly, even when massed together. The cool character of cow dung is 
illustrated by the fact that grooms employ it to stuff their horses' feet at 
night for the purpose of keeping them cool and moist. Horse dung is 
voided in a drier state, and is therefore much hotter in its character. 
Horse dung is chosen by gardeners to make their hot-beds, and to place 
under forcing frames. If heaped together in large quantities, it is liable 
to a form of dry-rot or " fire-fang," which is readily detected by a white 
dust that soon encrusts the straws, and causes dryness and lightness 
throughout the mass. 

Pig dung is cool in its nature, like that of cattle. 

Owing to these differences of nature, it is desirable that dung should be 
well mixed together, and this has an important bearing upon the design- 
ing of farm-buildings. 

AGE AND CONDITION OF THE ANIMAL. Adult animals allow a larger 
proportion of nutritive food-constituents to pass through the alimentary 
canal than young and growing animals. Phosphates are reserved for the 
formation of bone, nitrogen and salts for the development of muscle and 
blood, in the case of young animals ; whereas, in mature bodies, the pro- 
cesses of decay and elimination keep pace with those of nutrition. Lean 
animals absorb more nutritive matter from the food supplied than those 
which are fat or forward in condition. Hence the dung of fatting bullocks

becomes richer as they ripen. C<>'* In caZ/and in milk are in the sm 
condition, with reference to the food consumed, as growing cattle, for they 
have not only to feed a feet its, but in most cases to yield a supply of milk. 

FOOD OF THE ANIMAL. Beasts fed upon straw, or straw and turnips, 
furnish an inferior manure altogether to cattle receiving grain and cake. 
This difference is recognised by practical farmers everywhere. 

The difference in value between the excrementitious residue of a ton of 
>traw, a ton of turnips, of barley meal, of linseed-cake, and a variety of 
other substances employed as cattle foods, has been estimated by Sir J. B. 
Lawes, and reduced to a money standard. It is not necessary that these 
figures should be accepted as precisely fixing the commercial value of the 
manurial residue left by the consumption of the various foods mentioned. 
The figures are based upon chemical data, but in each case will require to 
be discounted rather heavily to compensate for the inevitable, as well as 
preventible, waste that always occurs.

ACCOMMODATION OF ANIMAL. In ordinary practice live stock are 
housed either in, (1) stalls or stables, (2) yards more or less covered, or 
(3) boxes. Apart from those considerations referring to the comfort and 
health of the animals, the effect of each of these modes of housing upon the 
quality of the manure is very considerable. 

Stalls or stables involve tying up the animals, and as this prevents free 
movement, the dung is all dropped in one place, and is very imperfectly 
mixed with the straw. These stalls are daily cleaned, and the dung and 
litter should be removed and spread over an open or covered yard, to be 
more completely trodden down or made. Where straw is scarce or com- 
mands a high price, the system of tying up in stables is in favour, as it is 
economical of litter. 

Boxes are highly favourable to the production of first-class manure. In 
the first place, they are invariably covered with a roof, which protects the 
dung from rain. All the moisture contained in box-made dung is therefore 
derived from the animal, and in consequence a less amount of straw is 
required than in the case of open yards. Boxes are generally devoted to 
fatting cattle living upon a highly nutritious diet, so that, apart from the 
protection they afford from rain, this constitutes another substantial rea- 
son why box-manure has obtained a high reputation. 

Yards. Of late years covered yards have been advocated, and where 
these have been erected, the conditions are identical with those of boxes. 
More commonly the yard is furnished with a shed, but is for the most 
part open to the sky. As cattle are only housed in winter, the season in 
which the greatest amount of rain or snow falls, open yards receive a large 
quantity of surplus water ; and especially when the sheds are not spouted 
or troughed, the manure becomes much wasted, and the quantity of litter 
required to keep the cattle comfortable is greatly increased. These con- 
ditions are not at all favourable to the accumulation of really good dung, 
and the system cannot be continued profitably when lai'ge sums are being 
expended upon feeding stuffs. At the same time, it is claimed as an, 
advantage by those who advocate fold-yards and sheds, that they enable 
the farmer to crush down his straw and make it into manure. In certain 
districts, perhaps, the " crushing down " of straw may be an advantage, 
but the idea now savours of the past. 

AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF LITTER SUPPLIED. This condition has already 
occupied us to some extent. To furnish litter ad libitum, so that the 
yards and boxes are always knee-deep in clean straw, is conducive to the 
comfort of the animals, but certainly impairs the quality of the manure. 
On the other hand, fold-yards kept in a spongy, miry condition favour the

escape of valuable materials by surface drainage and evaporation. Many 
good farmers endeavour to take a middle course, by allowing their courts 
to become miry, or the black liquid to be seen once or twice a week, before 
fresh straw is added. Another point of importance is the thorough mixin"- 
of the various sorts of dung. Buildings, as already mentioned, should be 
contrived with a special view to this end. Stables and stalls should open 
into, or be placed opposite, the gates of fold-yards, that the half-made 
manure may be spread abroad and thoroughly mixed. On no account 
should horse dung be allowed to accumulate in masses by itself. Pigsties 
should be so placed that the swine may have access to the yards, where 
they will not only act as scavengers, but root up and mix the manure- 
Pains should be taken to litter the yards evenly, and when necessary, to 
level the surface. Lastly, the more the 3 - ards are protected from rain and 
snow, the better will be the quality of the manure produced. 

AFTER-TREATMENT. Passing over the management of dung during its 
accumulation, as already sufficiently indicated, we come to the after- 
treatment, which must be allowed to exert an important influence upon it* 
efficacy. The tendency of late years has been in the direction of simplify- 
ing the processes by which dung was formerly prepared for application. 
In the opinion of many leading agriculturists, the best plan is to haul direct 
from the yard or box, spread the dung on the land, and plough it in. The 
limits within which this method may be recommended are, during the 
autumn or early winter, when " long " or " green " dung may be safely 
ploughed in ; upon stiff and deep land, that are capable of retaining 
the valuable matters contained in the manure, and are also physically 
improved by the decay of the straw and other organic matter. On the 
other hand, it is not advisable to plough in manure in the autumn, when 
by so doing it is brought into close proximity with rock, gravel, or coarse 
sand. When yard manure is applied in the spring it should be well rotted, 
so as to be at once available for the use of the crop, and to avoid dryinr* 
tin' soil and rendering it hollow. 

CHANGES ACCOMPANYING THE ROTTING OF FARMYARD MANURE. These 

changes have been carefully noted by Voelcker. They consist (1) in loss 
of weight, which amounts to from one-third to one-half, and even two- 
thirds of the entire mass of fresh manure, according to the degree to which 
the processes of decay are allowed to proceed ; (2) the quantity of valuable 
matters existing in a soluble state are materially increased ; (3) the pro- 
portion of nitrogen, and other of the most valuable constituents, is in- 
creased. The following analysis of fresh, long manure, composed of cow 
and pig dung, and of well-rotted dung that had been kept in the heap

To PRODUCK THE BEST QUALITY OF FARMYARD MANURE. From what 
has been advanced, it may be concluded that the best quality of farmyard 

dune is made under cover, by fattening cattle fed upon a liberal diet, in 
which oil-cakes form an important item. Further, that the thorough 



THK MAKING OF FARM-YARD MANURE. 471) 

mixing of the various kinds of dung is most advisable ; and if made into 
Leaps and turned, that every means should be used to prevent the escape 
of nitrogen. 

MANAGEMENT OF FARMYARD MANURE. Air and moisture are both es- 
sriitial to the proper fermentation of manure. If it is too dry, it burns, 
gi'ts " fire-fanged," white and mildewed ; and the high temperature of the 
manure promotes the formation of carbonate of ammonia, which is volatile 
and easily escapes into the air. This occurs when the temperature exceeds 
eighty degrees F. But when the manure is kept moist and the tempera- 
ture low, fermentation stops with the formation of organic acids which 
take up ammonia. The salts thus formed are present in the black decom- 
posed dung, and the ammonia in them is in a soluble form, but not vola- 
tile. A strong smell arising from the manure makes it evident that a 
wasteful fermentation is going on, but this fermentation is easily con- 
trolled. A quick fermentation will be induced by placing the manure 
lightly in heaps so as to allow the air to get at it ; a slower fermentation, 
by treading the manure down firmly, and a cool fermentation by keeping- 
the heap moderately moist. Liquid manure should be used either when 
it is necessary to moisten the heap, so as to check excessive fermentation, 
or, unless it be very dilute just before hauling to the field. 

Gypsum, as in the regular practice of the Ontario Experimental Farm, 
is added to the manure heap with the view of fixing the ammonia ; but 
where the management of the manure is otherwise good, this is not abso- 
lutely required. Chalk and lime arc'iound to have a very good effect in 
preventing escape of ammonia from farmyard manure, provided it is /jv*A 
manure. Applied to rotten manure, caustic lime causes a great loss of 
ammonia. 

As far as possible the formation of field manure-heaps is to be avoided ; 
it is best in every sense to haul the manure direct from the yards upon 
the land and spread it at once. The question of immediate ploughing in, 
or covering it, is of less consequence than has generally been imagined ; 
but on light soils the practice of immediate ploughing under is advisable.

HAT special manures are, generally speaking, has already 
been explained. They contain one, two, or more valu- 
able constituents of plant food, but are not sufficiently 
complex in composition to keep up the fertility of 
soils. They must, however, be regarded as highly use- 
ful under the following circumstances : (1) When a soil 
is deficient in some particular element of fertility, as 
lime, magnesia, or phosphates ; (2) When a crop has 
some particular requirement; (3) When soils are in 
high condition, and it is undesirable to stock them further with artificial 
fertility, special manures may be employed to bring out, and possibly to 
reduce their surplus wealth, by stimulating the growth of heavy crops. 

USES AND ABUSES OF SPECIAL MANURES. The first two cases in which 
special manures have just been recommended need not detain us further. 
But the third case, in which special manures are employed as a " whip," 
requires a little explanation. 

If nitrate of soda is applied to a wheat crop, the usual effect is a con- 
siderable increase in the yield both of straw and grain. Since nitrate of 
soda contains only one important constituent of plant food nitrogen ; 
and since the increased yield of wheat, owing to the application, removes 
from the soil a certain proportion of earthy matter as well as nitrogen, it 
is evident that the soil has been drawn upon to a greater extent than it 
would have been without the application. In this case, then, the nitrate 
of soda has actually reduced the stock of wheat ingredients in the soil. A 
soil thus treated year after year would be sooner exhausted than one cul- 
tivated without the aid of a manure of this class. This being the case, it 
is of importance to farmers to know how far the application of nitrate of 
soda is to be recommended. 

If nitrate of soda were employed alone, and year after year, no doubt 
the land would suffer, although many years might elapse before the evil 
effects became apparent. It certainly would not improve. If, as is usually 
the case, the farmer who employs the nitrate is in the habit of applying 
other fertilisers, such as " town manure," superphosphates, and lime, and 



THE SPECIAL FERTILIZERS OF THE FARM. 4 8 J 

also yearly consumes cake and grain upon the farm, the use of nitrate of 
soda becomes reasonable and right. The management is liberal and of an 
improving character, and the nitrate of soda only brings out the artificial 
fertility which comes of good farming, and does not prey upon the'natural 
fertility of the soil. The same remark would apply to the use of other 
special manures, such as lime. Repeated liming, according to the old pro- 
verb, " while it enriches the father, impoverishes the son." But lime ap- 
plied in conjunction with liberal management cannot be objected to on the 
score of exhausting the land. 

POSSIBLE LIMIT TO THE PROFITABLE USE OF ANY MANURE. As Ion 
a soil is deficient in a particular constituent, we may expect to see benefit 
from its application. If the land becomes sufficiently stocked with this 
constituent, we may find a change of fertilisers desirable. If a soil con- 
tains a sufficient proportion of phosphoric acid for the requirements of a 
wheat crop, and at the same time an excess of potash, we cannot expect a 
dressing of potash to be attended with any effect. A soil deficient in lime 
may be greatly benefited by an application of lime. But a second or third 
application of the same substance might produce but little effect, simply 
because lime had ceased to be a deficient element. Up to the present time, 
potash (owing to its existing in considerable quantities in farmyard man- 
ure) has not been lacking in most of our soils. If, however, from the cul- 
tivation of the potato, the growth of wool, or the sale of straw, the amount 
of potash became reduced below the point required, then a demand for 
potash salts would immediately spring up. 

In the present treatise it will be impossible to do justice to the large 
class of materials employed as fertilisers, but our aim must be rather to 
indicate the principle of their action. In the last section some substances 
were included which could barely be considered as coming under the de- 
signation of general manures guano, for example, often being deficient in 
potash. Similarly, under the class of special manures certain fertilisers 
approach in complexity the composition of a true general manure. 

PHOSPHATES. Calcium, potassium, sodium, and magnesium phosphates 
all of interest to agriculturists ; but from our present point of view the 
first named is incomparably the most important. Calcium phosphate is 
found in great abundance in the bones of animals, and it is also widely 
distributed as mineral phosphate and phosphorite. It occurs in very small 
quantities in all fertile soils, and it forms an important and abundant con- 
stituent of the ash of all our cultivated plants. In the cultivation of such 
ordinary crops as wheat, barley, and oats, no constituent is more largely 
drawn upon except nitrogen, the supply of which is derived, in a great 



EE 



482 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

degree, from the air. Thus, in the case of phosphates, we have a small 
supply and a great demand, and therefore, according to the law of mini- 
mum,, the application of phosphates might be expected to be followed with 

excellent results. 

BONES. At the commencement of the present century phosphates were 
applied as bones to pastures and to turnips. They were at that time 
ground into inch or half-inch bones, and in the case of pasture land were 
sown at from 3,000 to 5,000 Ibs per acre. The effects of this treatment in 
Cheshire afford well-known instances of the good effects of bones. In the 
case of Lord Combermere's estate, land was increased in annual value by 
this means from 10s. to 80s., and from 15s. to 40s. per acre. As a conse- 
quence " boning " became one of the best recognised methods of improving 

pasture-land. 

The reason for these striking effects is not far to seek, for, as the con- 
stituents of bone had been constantly removed from these pastures for a 
long series of years, in the shape of milk and young stock, it is no wonder - 
that they had become deficient in phosphates. 

A bullock of 1,000 Ibs. live weight, in store condition, contains about 
50 Ibs. of mineral matter, according to results obtained on a large scale at 
Rothamsted, by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert. This mineral matter, we may 
approximately state to have been collected from (at the most) two acres of 
land in three years, or from one acre in six years. This would be equal 
to the loss of V lbs - of mineral matter per acre per annum = 
to a loss of 33-2 lbs. in four years. On comparing this with the amount 
of mineral matter removed from tillage fields during a similar period, we 
find that, although decidedly less, the quantity of ash ingredients removed 
by grass land is very considerable. If a wheat crop of 28 bushels, and a 
barley crop of 33 bushels per acre, be taken during four years, the straw 
being supposed to be returned to the land, the amount of ash ingredients 
removed will be about 78 lbs. Although the per-acre loss on pasture is 
probably less than one-half what it is on arable land, it must be remem- 
bered that too frequently pastures are left unmanured, while tillage land 
receives much indulgence. 

There is an opinion abroad, which requires to be qualified, that grazing 
improves land, although all agree that repeated mowing acts injuriously. 
The marked effect of bones upon land long grazed, taken in connection 
with the figures just given, area sufficient refutation to such erroneous 



views. 



The effect of bones upon pastures is by no means uniform ; and caution 
should be exercised before employing them on an extensive scale. Their 



THE SPECIAL FERTILIZERS OF THE FARM. 483 

application is not always followed with a great increase of quantity ; but 
the quality of the herbage is invariably improved by the encouragement 
they give to the clovers and finer grasses. 

Besides calcium phosphate, raw bones contain calcium carbonate and 
azotysed carbonaceous matter (gelatine). The following analysis, by An- 
derson, fairly'represents their composition :

Bone-ash and animal charcoal containing from 70 to 80 per cent, of 
phosphates, and boiled bones from the soap-works, are largely employed in 
the manufacture of superphosphate. 

Bones which have been deprived of their organic matter by boiling or 
burning are more suitable than raw bones for the home process of dissolv- 
ing with sulphuric acid. They dissolve rapidly and completely, while the 
organic matter of raw bones carbonises and forms an imprenetrable enve- 
lope around each fragment, preventing the further action of the acid. The 
following plan is often pursued by agriculturists in the home process of 
dissolving bones : A ring of ashes is made on the ground of sufficient di- 
mensions. The bone ash, or crushed bones, are then placed in the enclosed 
area, and moistened with a sixth or fourth of their weight of hot water. 
From a third to a half of their weight of sulphuric acid of specific gravity, 
17, is then poured over them, and the moss is moved with rakes until the 
effervescence ceases. It is then allowed to stand for a few days, and if 
not dry enough, peat, sawdust, or any substance free from lime may be 
added to dry it. This process is employed by some farmers, who prefer 
to buy genuine bones undissolved, that they may know what they are 
using. Of late years, however, the diffusion of chemical knowledge has 
given an excellent safeguard from deception, in analysis. It will also be 
found that home-made superphosphate is less finely divided, and inferior 
in condition for drilling than that made in factories. 



484 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

GROUND OR MINERAL PHOSPHATE Its value as a fertilizer is derived 
from the phosphate of lime of which the mineral is partly composed. 
Coprolites, as to seventy to eighty per cent, of their substance, are a mixed 
phosphate and carbonate of lime. 

Athough there seems to be considerable difference in the results obtained 
by different experiments, the general conclusion seems to be that the 
usual difference in the effects produced by soluble and insoluble phosphates 
is much diminished when the latter are reduced to very fine powder and 
applied in very large quantities. The powdered phosphate is cheaper 
than the manufactured manure. But there can be no doubt that an in- 
creased use of ground coprolites would result in increasing their cost 
in the market, and the advantage would thus to some extent be lost. 

After fine grinding, the coprolite powder may be mixed with farm-yard 
manure, either under the cattle or ejse in the dung heap, and the carbonic 
acid formed by the fermentation of the dung tends to the solubility of the 
mineral phosphates by actual superphosphating. 

The addition of superphosphate to a field acts powerfully upon turnips, 
and other root crops. Its effects are not very evident upon wheat, but 
it has been noticed to exert a favourable action upon barley, especially 
when late sown. From what we know of the requirements of plants, we 
might naturally think that turnips and barley must require a large amount 
of phosphates, and that wheat had not similar need. This conclusion 
would be erroneous. For although a root crop certainly does remove more 
phosphates from a soil than a crop of wheat, a barley crop, practically 
speaking, requires about the same amount. A fair crop of wheat, of 32 
bushels, removes in grain and straw about 26 Ibs. of phosphorus pentoxide 
from the soil. Twenty tons of turnips, with their tops, take about 40 Ibs., 
so that a crop of turnips needs 14 Ibs. more than a crop of wheat. Wheat 
then undoubtedly requires a less weight per acre, it is proportionately 
richer than turnips in this element. Why then should phosphates act 
strongly upon turnips and barley, and scarcely at all upon wheat ? The 
main reason appears to be the long period during which wheat occu- 
pies the ground, and the amount of space covered by its roots. A manure 
is never useful unless it is wanted, and there is usually enough phosphorus 
pentoxide in good wheat lands for this crop, considering the length of 
time the plant is engaged in its search. The addition of more of this 
constituent therefore becomes superfluous in all such cases. With barley 
and roots it is very different. They both grow rapidly, and depend upon 
a thinner stratum of soil for their nutrition, hence they at once seize upon 



THE SPECIAL FERTILIZERS OF THE FARM. 435 

and utilise any fresh supply of tlie least abundant, and therefore most 
iinportiint, of the essential ash ingredients. 

The effect of superphosphate upon the root crop is certainly remarkable. 
In many districts 300 Ibs per acre is found a sufficient application. This 
will represent 30 Ibs. of phosphorous pentoxide, if the manure contain 20 
per cent, of soluble or monocalcic phosphates. But, supposing the turnip 
crop yields 20 tons per acre, it will have removed 40 Ibs. of this ingredient, 
so that it will have not only used all that was contained in the superphos- 
phate, but drawn upon the natural resources of the soil to the extent of 10 
Ibs. This can only be accounted for by the increased energy conferred 
upon the plant, in the early stages of its growth, by the superphosphate 
which gives it the power to thrive and send its roots in search of the 
mineral constituents native to the soil. 

Although superphosphate is the best manure for turnips, it occasionally 
happens that it produces but little effect. The cases in which disap- 
pointments occur have been thus classified by Dr. Voelcker : 

1. If the phosphates are washed out with heav}' rain or undergo changes 
which render them ineffective. 

2. If the soil contains a sufficient supply of phosphates, when an addi- 
tional supply can be of no avail. 

3. If the soil is deficient in potash, or other essential ash ingredients, 
in which case phosphates alone could not produce a result. 

LIME. 

Lime has already been noticed as a constituent of all fertile soils, and 
an ingredient of all cultivated plants. The high proportion in which it 
occurs in the ash of many plants is sufficient to account for its value as a 
manure, while its mechanical and chemical effects upon the soil enhance 
its agricultural value. The following plants j-ield a preponderating quan- 
tity of lime in their ash, and have therefore been classed as "lime plants." 

PERCENTAGE OF LIME is THE ASH OF CERTAIN CULTIVATED PLANTS. 



Potatoes (stem and leaves) 46.2 per cent. 

Tobacco 67.44 " 

Lucerne 48.0 " 

Red clover. .. . . 34.0 " 



White clover 32.2 percent.

Experiment has demonstrated that lime is absolutely necessary to the 
development of all plants, and the above list shows how largely it is ap- 
propriated by many leguminous and other crops. 



486 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP JEM A. 

Lime is employed with most effect (1) upon soils which are deficient in 
it; (2) upon stiff clays; (3) upon peaty soils, or those containing a large 
amount of undecomposed vegetable matter. It does not act energetically 
upon light soils. Again, on old tillage lands, especially those which have 
been frequently limed, it exerts but little effect ; while upon newly broken 
up lands it is highly efficacious. There is a general opinion among prac- 
tical men that lime should be in a highly caustic condition if applied to 
old tillage lands. Three, six, and nine tons per acre may be considered 
respectively to represent light, medium and heavy dressings per acre, and 
the effect is supposed to last about twelve years. 

Lime is applied in two conditions raw and prepared. When applied 
as marl or chalk, it may be spoken of as raw or crude; when subjected to 
burning or calcining, as prepared. 

Marl has already been defined as a mixture of clay and lime. It no 
doubt acts beneficially by virtue of both ingredients. Sandy soils have 
in many cases been greatly improved by the application of "marl" dug 
from the pits and spread upon the surface. It occurs as blue, gray, red, 
and yellow marl, of which the first and last are most valuable, and it is 
applied at the rate of forty to eighty cubic yards per acre. The compo- 
sition of marls is very various, some containing eight and others eighty 
to ninety per cent, of lime. They have been classified, according to 
composition, into true marls, or those in which calcium carbonate pre- 
dominates, and clay marls, or those in which clay is the chief constituent. 
Gypsum (calcium sulphate) is another form in which lime is employed 
as a manure. It is occasionally applied at the rate of from 200 to 50C 
or more per acre to clover and other leguminous crops. It may also be 
employed to fix the ammonia in ordinary farm yard manure, by scattering 
it over the floors of stables and upon manure heaps. Gypsum is an in- 
separable ingredient of all superphosphates, in which it exists as one of 
the results of the application of sulphur teroxide to phosphates abounding 
in lime. A dressing of 500 Ibs. per acre of a good superphosphate neces- 
sarily involves the application of about 200 Ibs. of gypsum. 

COMMON SALT (sodium chloride) has long been employed as a man- 
ure. It may be recommended especially for mangel-wurzel and wheat, 
and may be applied at the maximum rate of 500 per acre. The effect 
produced depends much upon the character of the land. Upon stiff and 
cold soils it is least effective, while upon warmer and dryer soils it is often 
beneficial. Common salt may be used with good effect upon pastures 
which carry a coarse herbage, and is useful to mix wiih nitrate of soda as 
an application for wheat. It checks the disposition of the nitrate to un- 



THE SPECIAL FERTILIZERS OF THE FARM. 487 

duly promote the growth of straw, and effects a more thorough distribu- 
tion of the nitrate by increasing the bulk of the dressing. 

FISH REFUSE contains nearly two per cent, of nitrogen, and one per 
cent, of phosphoric acid. It answers well as a manure for both wheat 
and root crops when made into a compost with its own weight of soil, and 
allowed to decompose before being applied. Fish guano is a manufacture 
of the refuse from oil-pressing and fish-curing establishments by pressure 
and treatment with sulphuric acid. 

BULLOCK'S BLOOD is used on a large scale as a manure, but chiefly for 
mixin^ with other fertilizers. In its natural state blood contains about 

O 

three per cent, of nitrogen ; when dried it contains about twelve per cent. 
It makes an excellent manure for turnips when mixed with bone-dust or 
phosphatic guano ; and, mixed with peat or mould, may be very advan- 
tageously applied as a top-dressing to wheat crops and to grass land. 

SEA-WEED is largely used as a manure on some parts of the coast. It 
is especially suited for the potato crop, which requires much potash a 
large mineral constituent of sea-weed. Sometimes it is used as a top- 
dressing to grass land. The action of sea-weed is the same as a green 
crop ploughed in. It contains all the ordinary constituents of land plants 
As itputrifies rapidly, it forms a quick manure. It is applied at the rate 
of twenty to thirty tons per acre. The usual practice is to spread it on 
the soil and plough it in ; but it is occasionally formed into a compost with 
earth and dung. The neighbourhood of the coast is in some districts a 
distinct element in the value of the land, on account of the sea- weed as a 
manure, which is thus more cheaply obtained. 

SEWAGE AS A MANURE. The difficulty in the way of its use is its 
enormous bulk in proportion to its valuable constituents. A ton of city 
sewage ordinarily contains only three pounds of solid matter viz , one 
pound of organic and two pounds of mineral constituents, the former 
yielding less than three ounces of ammonia, and the latter half an ounce 
of phosphoric acid and one and a half ounces of 'potash ; so that in a ton 
of sewage there is only about five ounces of fertilizing matter. One ton 
of guano may thus contain as much of the food of plants as twelve hun- 
dred tons of sewage. According to the market price of the former the 
theoretical value of the sewage ought thus to be about five cents per ton. 
Practically, however, there is no comparison between the values of the 
two manures ; because it is found that ten or even twenty times the 
theoretic equivalent of sewage is required to produce the effect of guano ; 
and considering the far greater cost of utilizing the sewage, only a nomi- 
nal price can be put upon it. 



488 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

There are several methods of u tilizing sewage : 

Irrigation is the method which has been most largely practised. It 
consists in distributing the sewage over the surface of well-drained fields, 
from reservoirs into which^the sewers empty, or into which their contents 
are pumped. 

In the dry-earth system^the sewage nuisance is dealt with house by 
house. Dry pulverized earth'in'movable boxes in privies is made the re- 
ceptable in which execreta are covered and rendered harmless, being still 
serviceable for gardens and 'fields. The system, fit enough for institutions 
where discipline prevails^ is hardly applicable to large towns, where it 
would entail the bringing in dry earth to the amount of from five to ten 
pounds for each individual daily. 

COMPOSTS may be defined as the collected rubbish of the farm mingled 
with lime, in the proportion of about five to 1. 

Trimmings and clearings of ditches, garden " rubbish," road scrapings, 
stinking stuff from pond bottoms, dead animals, anything in short, of vege- 
table or animal origin, inay'be converted into valuable manure. There is 
no better sign of tidy and thrifty farming than large collections of such 
like materials on roadsides and vacant spots. 

When composts are formed of dead animals, or of animal matter, such 
as refuse from slaughter-houses, fisheries, etc., lime should be avoided, and 
earth alone be used to prevent the escape of ammonia. 

GREEN MANURES. This is the term given to crops which are grown for 
the purpose of being ploughed in on the land which produced them. This 
was once a common practice in England, and still is in some parts of 
America, but the availability of commercial fertilizers, combined with the 
high prices obtainable for beef and mutton, has rendered the farmer more 
careless than he once was of the slower and more natural methods of 
maintaining or increasing fertility. 

By ploughing in a green crop, the surface soil is enriched not only by the 
elements which the crop derives from the air, but also by mineral and 
vegetable matters which is brought up by it from the subsoil. The green 
crop thus acts the part of a gatherer of plant food, and makes it easier for 
any crop sown after this green-manuring to get its supplies from the de- 
composing vegetation present in the soil. 

The plants best adapted for green-manuring, are those which derive their 
support principally from the air, which grow rapidly, which cover the 
ground well, and whose roots penetrate deep, and ramify extensively 
throughout the soil. 



THE SPECIAL FERTILIZERS OF THE FARM. 489 

Among the various plants grown for green-manuring are, buckwheat, rye, 
rape, and common clover. Many of these crops, when ploughed in green, 
are, weight for weight, almost as good as farm-yard manure, containing 
large quantities of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. The great weight 
of decomposable vegetable matter contained in the root as well as the leaf 
('f a crop, grown for being ploughed in as manure, is to be considered in es- 
timating its effect as a fertilizer. There can be no doubt that to this 
especially is due the fertilizing effect of a clover stubble when ploughed in 
as a preparation for the following wheat crop. Eight to twelve tons per 
acre may be grown of any of the crops we have named, with the aid of a 
special fertilizer. 

Green-manuring produces the greatest effect on light sandy soils in dry 
climates ; hence its more common use in the United States and Canada 
than in Britain ; but it is profitably practised also on heavy soils. The 
green crop should, if possible, be ploughed in just before the time of flower- 
ing, or at all events after it has arrived at considerable growth. The sea- 
son of the year for ploughing in must depend upon the nature of the crop ; 
but the operation is best performed in the heat of summer, as the condi- 
tions for rapid decomposition are then actively present, after the plants are 
turned in. To cover them effectually, they require to be first heavily 
rolled. A skim coulter should be used in the plough that is used, and the 
ploughing should be deep enough to retain moisture about the decaying 
plants. 

THE LIQUID MANURE OF THE FARM is the drainings or the washings 
from the farm-yard manure. The best use that can be made of it proba- 
bly is to return it to the dunghea;>, where means should be devised for its 
absorption or retention. If allowed to flow away from the cattle sheds or 
from the manure pile, it should be collected in tanks. From the collecting 
tanks it may be distributed over the land by a watering-cart, when the 
area is small. Liquid manure is chiefly valuable for the rapidity with 
which it produces its effect. It is well adapted to light sandy soils, but a 
failure on heavy clays. It is also more suitable for grass and root crops 
than for grain crops. By its use grass may be cut six or eight times in 
the course of a year. 

THE APPLICATION OF SPECIAL MANURES. The tendency of modern 
practice in manuring is to use readily soluble and quick-acting manures 
l-tit to use them sparingly at a time. Little and often is the rule. 

In applying fertilizers of a soluble character, it is found economical to 
manure the plant rather than the soil. The practice is especially appli- 
cable to mangels and other drilled crops, where the plants are a consider- 



490 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

able distance apart in the rows. The manure is deposited by the drill 
along the line of each plant row, and immediately covered in. Manures 
which are not so readily soluble produce the best effect when intimately 
mixed with the soil. The depth to which the manure is turned in should 
be regulated by the nature of the soil and of the manure. On a clay soil 
it may be buried deeper with advantage than on a sandy soil ; and a slow 
manure may be buried deeper than a soluble and quick-acting manure. It 
is not, however, good policy to bury any manure very deeply. The rain 
in a drained soil will soon distribute it throughout the mass to be fertil- 
ized ; and we must not forget that the producing power of a soil is gov- 
erned more by the mass of its vegetable bed than by the measure of its 
superficies ; and where the subsoil is unmanured the crop will often be 
underfed. One of the causes of the failure of red clover is traced, we 
believe, to the dying off of the roots when they penetrate beyond the depth 
of available manure. Soluble manures, like nitrate of soda and sulphate 
of ammonia, should be put on the surface ; but undissolved phosphate, and 
even guano, is best when just covered with the soil. Stiff clays are im- 
mensely benefited by a good dressing of /res// farm-yard manure ploughed 
under to a tolerable depth. 

Top-dressings with artificial manures are chiefly to be recommended for 
crops in the grassy stages of their growth wheat crops in spring, and grass 
lands at the same season, and especially in wet seasons. In such seasons 
one objection to this method of applying manure to wheat is the tendency 
which it produces in the crop to lodge. Salt will partly counteract this 
effect, and it does so by strengthening and to some extent shortening the 
straw ; but this is to counteract one of the principal objects of top-dress- 
ing. On clay soils, which produce strong straw, the tendency to lodge is 
less than on lighter soils. In dry seasons, on the other hand, top-dressings 
of artificial manures are often inefficient, and the drier the climate the less 
likely are they to answer. But there are doubtless circumstances when 
top-dressing may be profitable in any season as on poor soils, arid where 
the manure is applied for the first time on newly reclaimed land. A top- 
dressing of farm-yard manure always produces a good effect. In a wet 
season it is washed into the soil. In a dry one it is often very efficacious 
as a mulch on grass and arable land, too, if, as is sometimes done, it be 
applied to the latter immediately after the crop is put in, and before the 
plants come up. 

Artificial manures may be applied either in a dry or liquid form, broad- 
cast or in the drill.

GRAIN CROPS. 



'HEAT. Triticum vulgare, or common wheat is the 
most important and most valuable of our grain crops. 
I have no doubt it is generally known that botanically 
there exists no difference whatever between what are 
called winter and spring wheats : being of one family 
and varying only in form and habits of growth, the vari- 
ation has been brought about by habit ; winter wheat 
grows best by being sown in the fall of the year, and 
other varieties best in the spring, because they have been 
habituated to it not because they will not grow if reversed. Winter wheat 
sown in spring will grow the first season, but not mature until the suc- 
ceeding one, and spring wheat sown in the fall will either die off or come 
stronger and earlier in the spring. Yet a continuity of these changes 
will ultimately make the winter kind a spring, and the spring a winter 
one some doing better than others in both cases, and so it has resulted 
that we have at present established varieties of both winter and spring 
wheats. The fact of some having a beard, or a continuation of the awn, is 
but a variety of form of individual plants indicative of character, and 
generally, not always, distinguishes those of the least value as regards fine- 
ness and large flour producers. In this, therefore, we have more bearded 
spring than bearded winter sorts. It is not common for wild vegetable 
nature to give much value in large bulk and without much refuse, so we 
find neglected wheat, or wheat, requiring improvements, becoming open 
and rough in the head, the florets standing wide apart on the stalk, the 
chaff thick and rough and increasing in extent of beard. On the other hand, 
improving and well cultivated wheat becomes more compact in the head.the 
florets standing close together, the chaff reduced in thickness and length 
and almost altogether without a beard. 

Large value in small space should then be our first idea of a typical 
wheat plant of any variety ; to secure this the head, or ear, should be 
compact, having the most possible number of berries in the length and 
breadth, and covered or protected by the minimum quantity in thickness 



192 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

and length of chaff, or awn. Berries can be too close on the head in cer- 
tain climates, and maybe too heavily overlaid with covering so as to hin- 
der ripening and confine their individual bulk. The form of head best 
calculated to carry the largest number of berries with sufficient air room 
for proper maturing is that which, in whatever way it is presented to the 
eye, will appear of almost equal breadth, whether by the side or the face, 
the face being somewhat broader than the side ; the florets should alter- 
nate and overlap each other to about one-third of their height, should 
stand out from the stalk at an angle of 45 degrees, and never have less 
than two berries in each bunch or floret, some having as many as three and 
four. A thick-set head has five sets of florets to the inch, a thin one 
two. 

In judging the grain of wheat, the points are so important that it will 
be best to number and describe separately : 

1. The first thing that strikes the eye is Colour. Formerly Wheat was 
classified by White and Red, but now when we speak of colour as a point 
of merit in any variety it means that sort of transparency or brightness 
which reflects light, as opposed to dulness or having a bleached appear- 
ance. This should be uniform and not parti-coloured. 

2. Size, or evenness of sample, refers to uniformity of berries to each 
other, not some large and others small, but nearly all alike whether large, 
medium, or small-sized. 

3. Structure characterizes the gritty, hard, or flinty kinds from those 
that are soft and meally. 

4. The Skin may be thick or thin, rough or fine, and should always be 
smooth, unless when curly from its natural fineness. 

5. The Form, or outline, of the berries should be alike, whether long, 
short or round. 

G. The Bosom may be full and close, that is, with a well sprung rib, 
or an open and flat one. 

7. Plumpness has no reference necessarily to one uniform outline like 
a bag of flour, but that the berry is well filled-out, of whatever form, show- 
ing no slackness of skin from want of food not shrivelled. 

8. Smell should not be musty or sour. 

9. The Taste should be nutty, sweet and mellow, not sour or bitter. 

10. The Germinating points should be distinct ; the base, or root end 
prominent, and the blade end slighly hairy. 

Miscellaneous qualities : 

11. Hardy, productive, and a good miller. 

12. Weighing, after cleaning, not under GO Ibs. per bushel. 



THE CHOPS OF THE KAUM. 493 

IS. Comparative freedom from disease whether animal or vegetable. 
1-k To tiller, or stool, well that is, to produce five or more perfect 
plants from one seed, under good management. 

15. To have sufficient strength of straw to carry the head. 

16. The straw to be of good quality as regards freedom from pith. 

BARLEY (Hordeum disticJntni) 

\< a grain of extensis y e cultivation and great value. Like wheat and rye, 
it is both a winter and spring grain, though in this country it is almost 
universally sown in the spring. There are six varieties, differing in no 
essential points and all originating from the same source. London says, 
in choosing for seed, " the best is that which is free from blackness at 
the tail, and is of a pale lively yellow, intermixed with a bright whitish 
cast; ami if the rind be a little shrivelled so much the better, as it 
indicates a thin skin. The husk of thick-rinded barley is too stiff to- 
shrink, and will lie smooth and hollow even when the flour is shrunk 
within." 

The principal varieties are the two and six rowed ; the former being 
preferred for hardiness and productiveness in Europe, and the last 
generally cultivated in this country for the superior fulness, and freedom 
from smut. There are numerous sub-varieties. New varieties may be 
produced by crossing as with wheat. 

, OATS (Arena sativa). 

This important grain is peculiarly adapted for temperate climates ; and 
being a hardy plant, it is better suited for poor soils and cold climates- 
than either wheat or barley, and is consequently more easily cultivated. 
Friable soils are well adapted for oats ; but they are also grown on stiff 
clays, as well as on both peaty and gravelly soils, and, in fact upon all 
descriptions of ground. Oats are a gross feeding plant, and in this 
characteristic they exceed wheat and barley, requiring a larger amount of 
moisture than either. But a wet and cold summer, unless with the 
earlier varieties, leads to an untimely reaping time and a deficient 
harvest as evidenced prominently in Ontario during 1883. Oats thrive 
best where a lai-ge quantity of vegetable matter is present in a state of 
decomposition, and they are very generally taken as a first crop on newly 
reclaimed land ; on such soils, indeed, the best crops are grown both in 
respect to quantity and quality. Oats do not degenerate so rapidly as 
other grains, but for light lands a change of seed is advantageous every 
three or four years. 



494, THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

They are classified by White and Black, and both colours have 
branched and side varieties. 

RYE (Secale sereaU). 

There is but one variety of this hardy cereal, though cultivation has 
given two Spring and Winter the former being comparatively un- 
important. 

CORN. INDIAN CORN (Zea maize). 

This, next to Wheat, is by far the most important crop of the American 
'Continent. There is no one of the cereal grains or grasses which 
manifests itself under such multiplied forms as maize. The kernels are 
round, long, or flat, and are white, yellow, blue, red, or streaked. 

Nearly all the beef and pork of the vast and fertile West and much 
in the North and South fed upon it. 

PEASE (Pisum sativum) ; BEANS (Phaseolus vulgaris) ; TAKE, or VETCH 
(Vicia sativa) : are all embraced in the botanical order Leguminosce. 

PEASE. There is a multitude of varieties of the pea. The different 
kinds are distinguished by varying lengths of haulm, shape of pod, and 
seed, earliness or lateness, and by their edible qualities. The varieties are 
also known by their colours grey, brown, speckled, green, and white. 

BEANS. There are three varieties of field, or bush bean, usually culti- 
vated in the United States and Canada. The small white is most com- 
monly grown. It is the most prolific, bearing the closest culture, and the 
best for shipping purposes, being very hard, solid, and keeps longest on sea 
voyages. The kidney, or long white, is much larger and of better edible 
quality, requiring a longer time to mature, with a ranker growth ; and the 
marrow, with a large round kernel, and of equally good edible quality as 
the kidney, requiring the same time to mature. These two last are usu- 
ally worth full 25 per cent, more in the market than the small white, on 
account of their superior excellence for table use 

THE POTATO (Solanum tuberosum). 

A native of South America, and introduced into England some three 
hundred years ago. The variety is endless, differing in form from round 
to oblong, flat and curved, or kidney-shaped, their exterior is rough or 
polished, and of almost every hue white, yellow, red, and almost black, 
and the surface is smooth and even, with the eye scarcely discernible, or 
deeply indented with innumerable sunken eyes. The interior is equally 
diversified in colour, and is mealy, glutinous or watery, and sometimes 



THE CROPS OF THE FARM. 4,95 

pleasant and sometimes disagreeable to the taste. They likewise differ in 
ripening earlier or later, and in being adapted in some of their varieties 
to almost everj' peculiarity of soil. New kinds are produced at pleasure, 
by planting the seed found in the balls. The tubers obtained in this way 
will be small the first season, but with careful culture will be large enough 
the second year to determine their quality, when the best may be selected 
f r propagation. The earliest are easily designated by the premature de- 
cay of the tops. The varieties may also be increased from the seed by 
hybridizing, or impregnating the pistils of one flower with the pollen 
taken from the flower of another, and in this way some of the best and 
most valuable kinds have been procured. Such as have no flowers are 
more productive of tubers, as there is no expenditure of vitality in form- 
ing the seed. They may be compelled to flower by removing the small 
tubers from the stalks as they form. 

In selecting roots several points merit attention, and early maturity, 
quality, productiveness, and freedom from disease, deserve first consider- 
ation. Rough-skinned potatoes for the farm, with white fleh, equal well- 
shaped tubers, with shallow eyes, and of a dry, mealy quality. Abstractly 
they may be classified as Early and Late varieties. 

TURNIPS (Brassica rapa}, SWEDISH (Ruta ba'ga'). 

Cultivated by the Romans and placed by them as next to the vine and corn 
in importance; inBritain in the middle ofthe 16th century andstill the main- 
stay of high farming there,and though by reason of climate not so pre-eminent 
in the United States,are becoming equally valuable in Canadian agriculture. 
There are many varieties of this valuable bulb which differ considerably 
in average size, form, colour, taste, and keeping properties. Turnips should 
be judged, not only by produce per acre, but their feeding value as ascer- 
tained by analysis, or what is better by actual experiment. The form 
varies with the kind, and choice can be made for heavy or light soils 
according to habit of growth whether a shallow or deep rooter. The 
fine neck, as indicating quality, is one of the best guides, and compactness 
of shape is preferable for general cases. We are all desirous of having 
bulk, but as regards character of flesh how few pay attention to the fol- 
lowing : 

1. Evenness of grain throughout. 

2. No stringiness, or maiden's hair. 

3. Radiation, or streakiness of cellular tissue is objectionable. 

4. Regular marbling is good. 



496 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

5. Much mottling with dark spots is not good. 

6. Spirals, or twisted grain or tissue is not desirable. 

7. A waxiness is an indication of solidity. 

8. The general colour should be of an orange tinge, and distinct orange 
spots, averaging of an inch in diameter, are frequently in the best 
bulbs. 

9. Flavour varies much, but it is observable that a sweetness accom- 
panies the most solid. 

MANGEL-WURZEL (Beta vulyari^. 

The mangel-wurzel is the cultivated form of a wild sea-shore beet in- 
digenous to many of the countries of the temperate zone. It was known 
as a garden plant long before its field cultivation was extensively prac- 
tised. The roots are rich in saccharine matter, particularly those of the 
white variety, the cultivation of which, and the extraction of its sugar, is 
an important industry in many of the provinces of France and Germany. 

There are several well-known varieties in cultivation. On deep strong 
loams the Long Reds succeed well, and produce a great weight per acre ; 
but if overtaken by early frosts they suffer severely, as they stand high 
above the ground. The Red Globe is less productive, and better adapted 
for light soils ; the Orange anTl Yellow Globe are probably the most suit- 
able for every variety of soils. They are hardy and heavy croppers, and 
for quality they cannot be surpassed. 

( ARROTS (Paucus carota). 

There are several varieties in cultivation, amongst which the Altring- 
ham and the White Belgian are the most productive, and the most suitable 
to field cultivation. The former is long and tapering, and grows well 
out of the ground ; the latter is superior in productiveness, its habit of 
growth is larger and less tapering, being of more uniform thickness. 

HOPS (Humulus lupulu*\ 



There are several varieties some indigenous to this country, uncertain 
in early history, not mentioned in the Scriptures, and not clearly placed as 
a crop until the 10th century. Though a coarse growing, thriving plant, 
its cultivation requires as much attention as the higher orders. The pe- 
culiarity of the male and female flowers existing on separate plants adds 
to their more careful cultivation, as it is only the female flowers that 
constitute a crop, the others being of no value generally after the spread 
of the pollen.

SORGHUM SUGAR CANE f^,, l - ; /f lt im soccAarinum). 

Within a few yeare past, tliis syrup producing plant has become of 
great importance in the States lying north of the cane sugar zone, and 
may possibly be rendered still more so in the labour revolutions which 
have lately taken place in the cane sugar regions. 

It is an ancient plant, long cultivated" in Asia and Africa, for its 
saccharine qualities, and next to the tropical cane, perhaps more product- 
ive than any other. Its success in making sugar has not yet been 
properly demonstrated in America, owing, possibly, to imperfections in 
the mode of crystalization. But if it will simplv produce molasses its 
value can be scarcely too greatly magnified, in the economies of our soil 
productions. 

There are several varieties, as African Imphee, and others, but the 
Chinese, now most generally cultivated, appears to be most highly 
approved, for productiveness and mild and pleasant flavour. 

FLAX (Linum usitatisslmnm). 

This usually is classed as a special crop, not being so important to 
human welfare as many others, yet of much value, in conjunction with 
cotton, in the production of valuable fabrics. One of the oldest 
cultivated crops in the world's history at least 2000 years before Christ 
It is native to Europe, North Africa, ami America, with some varieties in 
other parts of the world. The plant is remarkable for the toughness of 
its fibre, the elegance of its shape, the beauty of the flowers, which art- 
blue, red, or white. 

THE GKASSES OF THE FARM. 

Although much has been said and written on the subject of grass cultuiv 
there still remains a great work to be accomplished in this important 
industry. 

Perennial grasses constituting rich, permanent meadows and pasture 
are generally acknowledged to be the true basis of the agricultural 
prosperity of a country, consequently the want of these must be a serious 
inconvenience and drawback to agricultural communities. What must 
then be thought of the practice, followed in many sections of the country 
f making a speciality of growing Timothy, which is a short-lived gr, 
and almost totally unfit for permanent pasture, to the exclusion of other 
grasses, many of them equalling it for hay crops, but all surpassing it in 
^permanency of meadow and pasturage.

498 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

" Grass," says an eminent professor, " commonly forms one single idea ; 
and a farmer, when he is looking over his fields, does not dream that 
there are upwards of three hundred species of grasses, of which thirty or 
forty may be at present under his eye." In this age of progress it is no 
longer excusable that the humblest farmer should be ignorant of the 
abo've facts. Comparatively speaking, some grasses are of no value to 
him, whilst others constitute the foundation of his riches, as they are the 
staff of life to the most valuable of the domestic animals. 

MEADOW CAT'S TAIL OR TIMOTHY (Phleum pratense}. 

Herd's Grass, as it was then called in the Eastern States, was first 
introduced and brought into cultivation in the State of Maryland, by 
Timothy Hanson, a native of one of the New England States, who built the 
first grist mill on Jones' Falls, now forming a part of the City of Baltimore, 
about the year 1720. When it first came into notice it was called 
Timothy Hanson's Grass, and sold in " Baltimore Town," by that name. 
The character and name of this grass was soon established by the fine 
crops of it grown on the Hanson Farm, and the name it received then, 
will, in all probability, forever adhere to it. It is supposed to have been 
introduced into England from Virginia, about the year 1760, and for 
years afterwards its cultivation was confined to moist and newly 
reclaimed peaty or moorish soils. 

The roots of Timothy grass are fine and near the surface, often in the 
second year forming a perfect mat. Its net-work of roots takes only the 
strength of the surface soil ; but they do that thoroughly, while all 
beneath is left hard and not permeable to air and light. In such con- 
ditions soils gain nothing if they do not absolutely tend to sterility. In 
two or three years the surface is exhausted, and unless annually over- 
flowed or artificially manured, the Timothy begins to die out. If it is 
then ploughed and seeded with Timothy again, this exhausted soil is turned 
to the bottom of the furrow, and the inert soil brought up to have the 
process repeated. A few years of such treatment will take the virtue 
out of any land, provided Timothy is grown alone. 

The experience of farmers in different parts of the country, in the 
cultivation of Timothy, is as diverse as the soils on which it is grown. 
While many of the theories advanced by them may be correct to the 
extent of their own observations, there are circumstances of soil and 
climatic influences which tend to produce results not always accounted 
for in their calculations. 



THE GRASSES OF THE KAKM. 499 

The soils best adapted for the growth of Timothy are moist, peaty or 
loamy, although there are fair crops grown on light gravelly soils, by 
heavy manuring, yet there are other grasses far more suitable for such 
lands. As it is generally conceded that Timothy is only profitable to 
grow as a marketable hay crop, to make it as remunerative as possible, is 
the object of the farmer, which can only be accomplished by the selection 
of suitable soils, liberal manuring, thorough pulverization and cleansing 
of the land. 

ROUGH COCK'S-FOOT, OR ORCHARD GRASS (Dudylis glomerata). 

This valuable grass is indigenous to the soil of America, and from its 
adaptability to various soils, its early and late growth, luxuriant foliage 
and nutritive qualities, is well entitled to an equality with any grass 
either native or foreign, which is being cultivated in this country. 

It appears that this grass was introduced into England previous to 
1700. It forms one of the most common grasses in English pastures, and 
enters either more or less into all mixtures for meadow or pasture, but is 
used very sparingly in mixtures for lawns. It has been found highly 
useful as an early sheep feed, and it grows well in winter. It grows in 
midsummer in a drought when everything else is parched or burnt up. 
All beasts are fond of it, both as pasture and hay ; it is permanent, grows 
in the shade luxuriantly, hence it is called Orchard grass. Any soil is 
suitable if not wet. 

Orchard grass, when sown with clover, grows as rapidly as clover, 
starts in the spring as early, and by this similarity of habit makes a suit- 
able grass to mix with it. For pasturage we greatly value Orchard 
grass, for three reasons : It stands a drought better than any other, will 
bear heavier stocking, and comes forward in the spring very early. Orch- 
ard grass, also, by its great amount of fibrous roots, tends to improve 
instead of impoverish the soil, and we have observed that an 
Orchard grass sod generally turns up a good dark colour on being 
ploughed. It is not at all fit for a lawn, as it sometimes grows in bunch- 
es or tussecks, especially when sown thin. Perhaps there are no other 
two grasses that can be sown together witli so great advantage as red 
clover and Orchard grass, by their union the crop is nearly double what 
it would be if each were sown separately ; they grow and flower well to- 
gether, come to maturity about the same time and the clover is supported 
from falling by the uncommon strength of the Orchard grass.

MEADOW FESCUE (Festuca pratensis). 

It comes near in its appearance to rye grass, but seems greatly superior, 
at least for the purpose of forming or improving meadows, as being larger 
and more productive in foliage. It is hardy, strictly perennial, and 
thrives well, not only in wet, but in dry grounds, growing in all 
tions It abounds in the best meadows, in the best hay districts, and in 
short seems well calculated to supply the defects of rye grass. It has 
also the quality of producing more seeds than most of the other sorts of 
grasses which grow rapidly and are easily gathered. No plant, whatever, 
deserves more the attention of the farmer than this, it being of certain 
growth easy culture, productive and remarkably sweet. It will thrive 
either dry or wet soils, an advantage which most others do not possess 
and except in point of early growth, it appears to be little inferior to 1

is observed to be highly grateful to oxen, sheep and horses, particularly 
the former. It appears to grow most luxuriantly with the hard 
This is said to be the Eandall grass of Virginia. 

TALL OAT GRASS (Arrhenotherum avenaceum). 

Tall Oat Grass, or Peruvian Grass of Virginia, though a rather coarse 
plant yet vegetates with great luxuriance ; it is early and productive, and 
affords a plentiful aftermath. It approaches the meadow foxtail in e 
cellence for which it may prove a substitute in many cases, 
times found abundant in meadows in England. On the continent 
Europe it is cultivated with advantage, and proved at the Experimental 
Farm to be suitable for Ontario. It is found most beneficial when retained 
in a close state of feeding. It makes good hay, is natural to sandy loan., 
but thrives best on strong, tenacious clays in England. Tall 
was introduced into the United States about the beginning of the pres< 
century. Judge Buel, of Albany, speaking of it in 1823, says : << It pos- 
sesses the advantage of early, quick and late growth, for which the cock 
foot is esteemed, tillers well and is admirably calculated for a pasture 
m-ass It has the advantage of Orchard grass, which it resembles m the

THE GRASSES OF THE FARM. 501 

Notwithstanding these advantages over the Orchard grass, it is not as 
valuable a grass, it never forms as thick and compact a sod as Orchard 
grass. It is more liable to injury from drought. It must never be left 
one day after it blooms, if you want first-class hay, and a rain will injure 
the looks of Oat grass three times as much as it will injure Orchardlgrass 
or Timothy. If, however, it is cut and handled right, it makes beautiful 
hay. If cut early and the summer is not an excessively dry one it will 
head twice in the same summer. I consider the Oat grass a more valu- 
able grass than Timothy, for pasture, and it is not nearly as exhaustive to 
the soil, and if properly handled will make as good hay and twice as much 
of it. 

SMOOTH STALKED FOA OR MEADOW GRASS. JUNE GRASS, KENTUCKY BLUE 
GRASS, COMMON SPEAR GRASS (Poa prate 



This grass has always been a favourite one in England as a mixture 
with other grasses for permanent pastures, meadows and lawns, but as a 
separate crop it israivly if ever cultivated. 

The Smooth Stalked Poa is a sweet grass, and readily eaten by cattle 
in general, it carries its verdure into the winter better than most others, 
and in the following spring throws out numerous young shoots, so as to 
make excellent spring food. It produces a good crop of leaves at the bot- 
tom, which makes exceedingly fine hay and is fit for cutting early in the 
spring. 

One writer says : " This is one of the most useful grasses, for it vege- 
tates in the driest soils, supports its verdure during the winter, and in the 
spring throws out numerous shoots for early pasture, the hay is also of 
fine quality." 

Although Poa pratensis is known all over Northern Europe as far as 
St. Petersburgh, 60 decrees north latitude, yet in no part of Europe has 
the merits of the Poa family been so fully developed as in the States of 
Virginia, Maryland and the far famed Kentucky Blue grass region. This 
region also extends over several counties in Ohio, but the grass does not 
seem to flourish so luxuriantly on the Ohio side, although in other coun- 
ties of Ohio, it is said to grow as luxuriantly, and form as staple a pasture 
grass as it does in any part of Kentucky. The cultivation of this grass 
must have improved wonderfully within the last fifty years. 

W. S. Rand, of Lewis Co., Kentucky, who has had a large experience in 
the cultivation of Poa Pratensis, says of it : " Common Spear grass and 
Kentucky Blue grass is one and the same, varying in size and appearance 



502 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

according to the soil and latitude in which it grows. The plant is a light 
green colour, the spikelets frequently variegated with bluish purple. 
Flowers in June, but once a year, which recommends this for lawns. The 
produce ordinarily is small compared with other grasses, but the herbage 
is fine. It grows in a variety of soils, from the dryest knolls to a wet 
meadow. It does not stand severe droughts as well as the Orchard grass. 
It endures the frosts of winter better than all other grasses, and continues 
luxuriant through mild winters. It requires from two to three years to 
become well set, does not arrive at perfection as a pasture grass till the 
sward is older than three years, hence it is not suited to alternate hus- 
bandry, or where the land is to remain in grass only a few years and then 
to be ploughed up. The best Blue grass is found in shaded pastures. It 
is the firstplant that puts forth its leaves and remains green if the season 
i.s favourable. Early in the fall it takes a second growth and flourishes 
vigorously until the ground freezes. Blue grass makes the sweetest and 
best of hay. It should be cut as the seeds begin to ripen, spread well and 
protect from rain and dews, on the second day stock and shelter and salt- 
Blue grass is not commended to cultivate especially for hay. It is not as 
profitable a product to merchandize as Timothy and Orchard grass. Blue 
grass on limestone land is perpetual, if properly managed, and the perfec- 
tion it attains in Kentucky is to be attributed to favourable soils, a tem- 
perate climate and mild winters, all of which have contributed to make 
Kentucky Blue grass the basis of our agricultural wealth and prosperity." 

FOWL MEADOW FALSE RED TOP (Poa serotina.) 

This grass has been known and cultivated in the New England States 
from anearly period. It grows tall and thick, making a more soft and 
pliable hay and better adapted for pressing and shipping off for the use of 
horses on board, than Timothy. It yields well to the acre, and will not 
spoil, although it stands beyond the common time of mowing. It must be 
sown in low moist land. The cultivation of this grass seems to be prin- 
cipally confined to the New England States, where it is considered a val- 
uable one. Its merits consist in its thick and abundant growth on land 
more moist than is well adapted to common upland grasses. It never 
TOWS so coarse or hard but that the stalk is sweet and tender, and eaten 

O 

without waste. 

It should enter largely into a mixture with other grasses sown on good, 

moist soils. 



THE GRASSES OF THE FARM. 503 

YELLOW OAT GRASS (Avenaflavescens). 

Yellow Oat Grass, grows naturally in dry pasture, on rather light and 
good soils yields a considerable bulk of fine herbage, and deserves to form 
a portion of all mixtures on light, dry soils, either for hay or pasture. It 
arrives early at maturity, and although a perennial, yet if allowed to 
ripen seed, it is but of short duration, particularly if grown on stiff, moist 
soils. It is the most useful, as a hay and pasture grass, of the genus Ave- 
na, as well as the smallest seeded of all the native species. 

Mr. Tauton says of it : " That it is so rich in its qualities, and so uni- 
versal a citizen of the world, that there is no soil from the lightest calca- 
reous loam, to the stiffest clay into which he would not introduce it where 
he intended to form a permanent turf." It is said that a top dressing of 
lime will double the produce of this grass, and that it thrives best on cal- 
carious soils. 

FINE BENT GRASS, OR RED TOP. (Agrostis vulgar is). 



This grass has always been considered as a troublesome weed in dry, 
light soils, and not being well liked by cattle, it commonly attracts atten- 
tion as a useless grass to be got quit of as soon as possible, more particularly 
as its creeping roots prove highly injurious to the soil. .However, not- 
withstanding its bad qualities, sheep are found to eat it, and it is some- 
times sown on bare, gravelly places, where the more valuable grasses will 
not grow for the purpose of covering them with vegetation. Red Top has 
been long and favourably known in this country as a permanent pasture 
grass. It is supposed by some to have been introduced into the Northern 
States. But I am inclined to the belief that it is as much indigenous to 
the soil of America as it is to that of any part of Great Britain. It is 
found growing naturally on fertile and medium soils, and there are few 
meadows of three or four years' standing in which Red Top is not found 
in abundance, and is sure to assert its supremacy and become permanent, 
while in the course of six or seven years the Timothy has disappeared. 

Red Top as a mixture with other grasses is necessary, but only in small 
quantities, on land capable of producing better grasses. On soil, where 
the more valuable grasses will not succeed as already stated, it is highly 
useful for the purpose of covering them with vegetation. On pasture 
lands where Red Top predominates, the fields must be overstocked, for if 
allowed to grow up to seed, the cattle refuse it, which is sufficient evi- 
dence that it is not so much relished by stock as some of the other pasture 
grasses. Red Top and the now very popular Rhode Island Bent, are one 



504 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

and the same grass, any difference in their appearance being produced by 
varieties of soils. Although it is claimed that the Agrostis, or Bent grasses 
thrive best in moist soils, yet it has been sufficiently proved that Agrostis 
vulgaris (the true Red Top) may be sown to advantage on a variety of 
soils. 

It answers well to sow Red Top separately on moist lands where old 
grass has run out, or become mossy. On such places it would fill the soil 
with its numerous roots and make it more passable. Also on moist, un- 
drained soils, liable to occasional overflow, if cut early, it has a thick 
bottom, and makes a heavy crop of second-hand hay. 

PERENNIAL RYE GRASS. (Lolium perrenne). 

Perennial Rye Grass contains upwards of sixty varieties, some of which 
are annual. 

It is found to flourish on most kinds of soil, and grows under circum- 
stances of different management on many upland situations, though sound 
and somewhat moist midlands are the most appropriate. It soon arrives 
at perfection and produces in its first year of growth a good supply of 
early herbage which is much liked by cattle. It produces an abundance 
of seed which is easily collected. Perhaps there is no other grass so 
widely known, and in years past, so extensively cultivated as Rye grass 
has been, throughout Britain. At present it is supplanted to a great ex- 
tent by the cultivation of Timothy, which seems as in this country to have 
become an universal favourite. Like Timothy, the Rye grass is an impov- 
erisher of the soil, and requires annual top dressing, else in a few years 
the land becomes exhausted and the grass dies out. The analysis of this 
grass will favourably compare with the best of cultivated grasses, and 
should be a strong recommendation in favour of its cultivation on a more 
extended scale than has yet been given it in America. It is superior to 
Timothy, as a mixture for permanent meadow or pasturage. 

ITALIAN RYE GRASS. (Lolium italicum.') 

The marked distinction between Italian Rye Grass and the perennial 
rye grass and its varieties is f hat Italian Rye Grass has an awn or beard 
adhering to the seed while the varieties of the perennial are beardless. 

Compared with any of the varieties of common rye grass, the Italian Rye 
Grass affords a stronger braird, arrives at maturity sooner, has a greater 
abundance of foliage, which is broader and of a lighter or more lively 
green colour, grows considerably taller, is more upright or less inclined to- 



THE CLUVKKS (>F THE FAKM. 505 

spread on the ground, its spikes, as .already stated, are longer, spike! 
more thinly set, and upon the whole producing a less bulk of seed which 
mailer. In France this grass is stated to be generally sown in autumn 
at the rate of 1G to 18 pounds per acre, and the seed rolled in ; that in the 
next autumn the turf is covered like an old meadow, and the crop of the 
following year is more than double ; its growth, also is so rapid, that if 
sown with clover or lucerne, it will quickly choke them. It is also said 
to be of such a hardy nature that when cut in November, it has put forth 
fivsh shoots of a foot in length in the close of December, and it has been 
found to stand the winter in the North of Europe. In quickness of 
growth this grass has excelled all others of the true grasses which I 
have sown this spring and, bids fair to be a good crop notwithstanding the 
severe droughts it has been subjected to. Italian Rye grass is preferable 
to any of the other varieties for soiling purposes, it gives an early, quick 
and successive growth till late in the fall, it will stand any amount of 
forcing by irrigation, liquid manure or phosphatic applications It has 
been grown successfully at Guelph, Ontario, but for permanency has to be 
associated with the more hardy grasses in order to withstand the winters. 

HUNGARIAN GRASS, BRISTLY Fox TAIL GRASS (Setaria yermanicum). 

This grows in a dry warm soil. The stalk is nearly solid and the hay 
very heavy, and if cut in time will be as green as grass, and a horse will 
want little grain for ordinary farm work. One advantage in raising 
Hungarian grass is the lateness it may be sown, for a farmer finding in 
June that his meadows are light, or his corn a failure, can sow Hungarian 
grass and make up the deficiency. 

Many make a mistake in seeding too soon ; the crop will be more or 
l'-ss injured by weeds, which seem to grow under all circumstances. It 
needs but seventy days of reasonably good weather to make a crop of hay 
from this grass. 

THE CLOVERS OF THE FAEM. 

The clovers or artificial grasses, belonging mostly to the Leguminosa or 
Pulse Family of plants are cultivated and used both in a green and dried 
state as food for the domestic animals. 

The artificial grasses have been cultivated over two centuries in Eng- . 
land. Red clover is supposed to have been grown as a field crop since 
lt>33. In this country ; the introduction and cultivation of Red clover 
dates from 1770, about that time a small quantity of red clover seed 



506 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

reached Philadelphia, and was sown in gardens, and on pasture lots in the 
neighbourhood of the city. 

Of the many substitutes for clover, which are grown in England, such 
as lucern, sainfoin, &c., few of them are as yet extensively cultivated 
with any degree of success in this country although lucern seems to be 
far better adapted to the climate of this country than that of Britain. 
Sainfoin has been cultivated in England since 1651, and is still in high 
repute. Alsyke clover is not receiving the attention to which its superior 
merits entitle it. The yellow clover or trefoils grow naturally on 
A variety of soils throughout the country, on 'all of which they seem to 
flourish, but are not cultivated to any extent deserving of notice. 

To those who follow a system of soiling their cattle during the spring 
and summer months a variety of artificial grasses will be found of great 
benefit, as to which see special chapter on " soiling." 

COMMON RED CLOVER (Tnfolium pratense). 

Red clover abounds in every part of Europe, and even in Siberia. Al- 
though it flourishes in dry, barren and shady places, yet it delights most 
in such as are rich, moist and sunny. This plant affords a large produce 
of leaf and blossom, by which the land is preserved in a more perfect state 
of closeness and shade, while the crop continues upon it, than by any 
other .artificial grasses. It has consequently a greater influence in amel- 
iorating the soils and preparing them for wheat crops to greater ad- 
vantage. 

The soils best adapted to the growth of clover, as regards its nutritive 
properties are decidedly calcarious ones, and the same may be said of 
other grasses as well. No part of Europe, for instance, produces natural 
grass of a finer quality than Ireland, and much of it has been immemori- 
ally in pasture, but the surface soil lies almost throughout the island upon 
a limestone bottom. 

WHITE CLOVER DUTCH CLOVER (Trifolium repens}. 

Trifolium Repens or White Clover is also known under the name of 
Dutch Clover, from the English having first learned its use from the 
Flemings, and from large quantities of the seed being imported from Hol- 
land. Its favourite soil is limestone, but it is one of the most general 
grasses, being found in almost every situation, from the lowest to the 
highest meadow ; though on very poor land it is often so small, and grows 
in such a creeping manner among the lower leaves of other herbage, that 



THE < 'LOVERS OF THE FARM. 507 

it is scarcely perceptible until brought up by top-dressings, which prob- 
ably has given rise to the very general opinion that it is indigenous to 
some soils. The central root penetrates to a considerable depth, and the 
plant is thereby enabled to resist the effects of drought, particularly on 
sandy soils. 

The branches which trail on the surface send fibrous roots from their 
joints down to the ground, and hence this species of clover maintains it- 
self in land of opposite qualities, for if the surface be too dry to afford 
nourishment to the foliage, it is preserved by the roots. It is not, how- 
ever, so nutriti ve as the common annual red clover, nor does it form a 
good pasture when sown by itself, for it has been found injurious to 
sheep ; but, combined with other grasses, it is a valuable plant. It has 
been said there is no better test of good land than its running spontane- 
ously to white clover. Its analysis is a good one. 

ALSYKE OR PERENNIAL HYBRID CLOVER (Trifolium Itybriditni). 

Alsyke or Perennial Hybrid Clover, which takes its name from the 
Alsyke district, near Stockholm, was first introduced into Sweden. 

Within the last century vast improvements in agriculture have enabled 
this valuable clover to be brought to great perfection, and it is now held 
in high estimation by the Swedish farmers, and extensively cultivated by 
the leading agriculturists in Great Britain and America. 

YELLOW CLOVER, HOP TREFOIL, OR SHAMROCK CLOVER (Trifolium 

procumbend). 

The Shamrock clover grows naturally on dry, gravelly places, and has 
been recommended for growing on such soils as are incapable of support- 
ing the more valuable grasses and clovers ; but, from the small bulk of 
produce which it yields, the propriety of its cultivation is questionable, 
and, besides, cattle are not found to relish it if they can procure more nu- 
tritious food. 

It is also very liable to be injured by mildew. Trifolium Procumbens 
is readily distinguished from Trifolium Filiforme, by its more compact, 
upright, and branching habit of growth, and by its close, globular, shining 
heads of yellow flowers. 

LUCERNE (M<'dlc<i<j<> w<m). 

Lucerne was introduced into British husbandry about the middle of the 
17th century, and has ever since been cultivated successfully in the British 



508 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Isles. It still continues a favourite plant for soiling purposes. Although 
the virtues of Lucerne have been most largely descanted on by British 
writers, it is a plant which is far better adapted to our own climate than 
that of Britain, as abundantly evidenced at the Ontario Experimental 
Farm. The latter country it would appear, does not possess the requisite 
degree of heat and dryness to insure the full advantage of its real value as 
with us. It pushes forth with vigour in the spring, and increases in lux- 
uriance from year to year. It is generally fit for cutting a fortnight 
earlier than red clover. It starts with remarkable vigour immediately 
after being cut, and in the course of a week the field is again covered with 
verdure. Lucerne requires a deep soil, although if sown on a dry, light 
soil, it will extend its roots downwards to a great depth, and will show 
increased luxuriance of growth year after year. 

This clover is so important that we give its analysis :

SAINFOIN or COCKHEAD (Onobryclus sativa). 

France is considered the country most favourable to the growth of Sain- 
foin. In Europe it is commonly called French grass (Sainfoin, Holy Hay) . 
In Switzerland and other mountainous countries, Sainfoin is a main de- 
pendence, because in many parts of those countries the finer grasses will 
not grow profitably. 

Sainfoin has long been cultivated in England, and is found growing 
wild in nearly all the chalky districts of the kingdom. Its cultivation is 
still an important feature in British husbandry. Chalky soils, and sand 
upon chalk, are its favourite soils; also loams and clays, if not too stiff or 



PERMANENT PASTURES. 5Q9 

too deep. On limestone it does well, too on very dry, sound gravels 

but not if the under stratum be mixed with clay. 

COMMON VETCH, or TARE (Vici<i .W//Y/). 

From its tall, close, hard}' growth, and succulent nature, this plant is 
capable of being introduced with considerable advantage after the manner 
of artificial grasses, between different kinds of grain crops, without ex- 
hausting the land of its fertility ; at the same time it will afford a useful 
supply of green or other provender for the consumption of different sorts 
of cattle. Writers on agriculture distinguish two species of the common 
variety of the other. The former is much less hardy than the latter or 
tare, namely, the spring and winter tare. Probably one is only a 
winter tare, the plants of which are capable of resisting the effects of the 
most inclement seasons. 

With respect to soil, this plant is almost without limitation, as it will 
grow on all the varieties, from the superficial gravel to the deep, stiff clav: 
yet on gravelly loams, when too much moisture does not prevail, it 
flourishes most vigorously. 

There is no herbage more grateful to the horse, cow, or sheep, in the 
hot season of July, than the juicy vetch. And for milch cows particularlv 
the flow of milk will be increased, the butter of prfme quality, and the 
advantages derived from the growth of this early forage plant will soon 
manifest itself. 

PERMANENT PASTURES. 

The importance of this branch of agriculture may be thus briefly sum- 
marized : 

(1) IT GIVES SEVERAL CROPS PER ANNUM. 

When varieties of grasses and clovers are established in association, the 
case is one much similar to what nature, under the best of circumstances, 
offers to animal life change every week from May to October. It is then 
a point to be studied in choosing the kinds, that they do not all, or even 
many of them, come during one month or leave off altogether at the same 
time of the year, but come and mature and go off, if possible, in regular 
succession from spring to autumn. Thus every week, or every month at 
least, is equal to a change of h'eld, and secures the value so much desired 
through such conditions. 






510 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

(2) IT OFFERS AN EARLIEK AND LATER BITE THAN OTHER PASTURES. 

It is a well-known fact in the growth of pastures where a number of 
different plants exists, that by such an association there is mutual sup- 
port, nursing, and shelter, which give early and late growth. The value 
of this early bite is something incalculable after a long, close winter, and 
particularly, it meets the heavy " back-going " of which we see so much 
in ordinary practice among cattle and sheep. So also, the rich " foggage " 
sends on deep into winter. 

(3) ANIMALS ARE MORE HEALTHY AND LESS LIABLE TO DISEASE VPON IT. 

All experience goes to show that browsing animals more than others 
require change of food often, not only in the form of soft succulent growth 
but harder and woody matters at the same time. Some of the grasses and 
clovers are also directly medicinal to cattle and sheep, so that altogether, 
with a choice of ten or twelve throughout the season, health is better and 
diseases less frequent. 

(i) IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE DESTROYED BY DROUGHT OR FROST. 

The immense importance of this needs little comment : it comes strongly 
home to us in this country. It is obvious that as association of plants and 
roots gives mutual support and protection with a close surface, there is 
necessary much less risk of damage when rain is scarce and heat abun- 
dant much less evaporation and less "cracking" of the surface. As 

crop after crop succeeds each other week by week and month by month, 
the soil is not exposed to the burning sun, and moisture is retained to 
nourish at all times. Then again, if winter or summer excesses do kill two 
or three kinds, there remains enough to make the pasture still of greater 
value than anything else. All through the very severe drought of several 
seasons past, the permanent pasture of the Ontario Experimental Farm 
was never bare, never wanting a fresh bite, but so close and strong that 
we had to separate with the hand in order to view the surface soil. 

(5) IT GIVES MORE DAIRY PRODUCE THAN ANY OTHER FORM OF FODDER. 

During the last half century the best managed old pastures of England 
have stood at more value per acre than the richest arable land, partly lie- 
cause of their permanency of crops, and largely because of their being able 
to graze three cows per acre. There seems no reason why Ontario cannot 
do one-third as well as this, and I am convinced it can be done. For 



PERMANENT PASTURES. 5U 

three years in succession on the Experimental Farm, on a small scale, on 
comparatively old permanent pasture, and on that of two years' standing, 
we have clearly proved that seven sheep per acre can be well done to. 
This is equivalent to one and one-quarter cow per acre. There is, then, 
no other form of fodder that can do the same thing. 

(6) IT GIVES THREE TIMES MORE BEEF AND MUTTON PER ACRE THAN 
OUR ORDINARY ROTATION PASTURES. 

The average timothy and clover pastures of the country, in connection 
with mixed farming, just graze on an average, one cattle beast to every 
three acres taking from 1st May to 1st November on an average of 
years. This is substantially correct. But we have shown in the preceding 
paragraph, that three and three-quarter cows can be kept on three acres of 
the permanent kind required, and as the proper stamp of two-year-old 
steers and heifers preparing for the butcher eat more than an ordinary 
milk cow, we shall say one beefing animal per acre. There are at the 
present time about 20,000,000 arable acres in Ontario, possessing practi- 
cally no permanent pasture, but 3,500,000 acres of rotation pasture that do 
or should therefore maintain 1,190,000 head of, say, beefing cattle. Were 
only one-tenth of this rotation pasture under the permanent form of it, 
the annual gain to the Province would exceed $11,000,000. The magni- 
tude and national value of a few acres, per farm, of first-class permanent 
pasture is thus apparent. 

(7) IT CAN BE USED AS A SOILING CROP ANNUALLY. 

When everything is most propitious and gr&ss abundant, and where a. 
number of bulls and calves are housed during summer, and a reliable cut 
of green foder is most important, this can always be had from well-man- 
aged, permanent pasture, early and late, at the rate of ten tons per acn-. 
green weight, where no systematic soiling crops are upheld. 

(8) IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE AND MAINTAIN THAN ANY OTHER 

CROP. 

While it cannot be maintained that there is no trouble, time, and ex- 
pense incurred in establishing successfully all that we desire in this con- 
nection, nor that its permanency and value can be upheld without top- 
dressing materials, it is not difficult to see that once fairly afoot, perman- 
ent pasture costs a great deal less per acre per annum proportionately to 
produce received than any other crop can possibly do. 



512 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

(9) IT IS A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF RELIANCE AND WEALTH. 

Most other things may fail during a particular season, times may be 
bad. and disease decimate the farm, yet the permanent pasture will smile 
and invite a share .of its wealth. 

(10) IT IS PERMANENT- 

The successful establishment and maintenance of permanent pasture 
implies : 

1. A soil free of dead water. 

2. A rich surface, friable but firm, 

3. Depth of soil to allow roots beyond reach of drought. 

4. A retentive soil to resist drought and hold moisture. 

5. Securing variety of grasses and clovers and thick seeding. 

6. Easv pasturing for first two seasons. 

7. Heavy stocking, to keep down rougher plants. 

8. Top-dressing, at least every third year. 

But more specifically on such an important subject, clay lands tend ra- 
ther to be selected for the growth of grass, because of the burden of 
labour cost which in their case attends arable cultivation. And for the 
same reason the increasing cost of labour the whole area of pasture 
land in England, for example, is gradually and has been of late years even 
rapidly increasing. But lands of all kinds, chalky, sandy, loamy, clayey ; 
all furnish their contingent to the pasture area of the country. It is a 
en-eat advantage to all farms of whatever soil to have a certain proportion 
of permanent pasture. 

The value of the annual produce depends on the quality of the soil and 
the management of the crop. Pastures are indeed quite as amenable to 
treatment as ploughed fields. Continuous manuring of any one kind 
rapidly changes the character of the grasses and other plants covering the 
"round. Continuous mowing or continuous depasturing, continuous 
treatment of any kind indeed, favouring as it does one set of plants rather 
than another, ultimately gives them the advantage in the perpetual con- 
test of growth which is maintained among them, and the result is soon 
visible in the altered character of the vegetation. 

It is of course on the presence of the better and more nutritious grasses 
and clovers and the fitness of the soil and circumstances to luxuriant 
growth that the value of any pasture depends ; and the composition of a 



- 



PERMANENT PASTURES. 



513 



bit of good turf is thus the principal index to the value of the field. The 
vegetation is made up largely of grasses, somewhat of clovers, and also to 
some extent of weeds. 

Pasture grasses are those smaller perennial species usually associated in 
meadows which are grown for their herbage : grain or cereal grasses being; 
the larger kinds cultivated for the sake of their seeds. When we examine 
any mixed pasture we shall conclude that the plants present in it are in 

various conditions as to vigorous growth and cultivation various states- 

of prosperity, some developing, while others it may be, are declining. And 
if we neglect to drain, weed, manure, and roll our meadows, we neglect, 
the proper cultivative agencies which are calculated to maintain their 
prosperity and excellence, and they will gradually relapse into a more or 
less wild state. 

The best turf, then, is that which is composed of the best sorts of 
grasses ; and these may be in a good or bad condition, according to the 
state of cultivation. When only good grasses prevail, the crop of hay 
will be of the best quality and of the greatest yield. But as a rule few 
meadows are made up wholly of grasses; and all good natural pastures 
have also a varied collection of other plants, which differ greatly accord- 
ing to the nature of the soil and the state of its cultivation. 

Besides those that are invariably present in good grazing grounds, there 
are in all grass land as in all arable land many weeds. They are more 
frequent in poor pasture than in rich grass, and much more frequent in 
lands annually mowed, than in lands which are annually grazed. There 
is less opportunity in the latter case for their seeding and propagation. 

Owing to this variety in the character of its herbage and the varying 
circumstances out of which it has arisen, the value and capabilities of 
grass land vary very greatly between the extreme of the poor hill 
pasture, adapted only for sheep, and the richest feeding land to be found 
in some of our river and valleys. 

Many considerations affect the question of the most profitable mode of 
managing pasture land in any given locality. The climate and soil, the 
position of the land with regard to railways and markets, and the 
existence of any special demand for live stock or for its produce of any 
description, the healthiness and suitability of the land for breeding 
feeding, or dairying cattle, or for breeding or fattening sheep, the supply 
of labour, all need to be taken into account. 

Strong rich pastures producing, succulent grasses abundantly, are well 
adapted for fattening large cattle either without any extra food, or with 
the aid of a little cake. Second-rate pastures, especially if on a cold 



GG 



514, THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

subsoil, will generally yield a better profit from the dairy, and from the 
rearing of young cattle. Dry hilly pastures are most suited to sheep. 
The grazing of land by a mixed stock of cattle, sheep, and horses results 
in the land being more evenly grazed than where one kind only is kept. 
Where, however, many sheep are grazed with cattle, as they pick out all 
the finest of the grasses and clovers with their narrow noses, the cattle 
will not thrive so well. But sheep, on the other hand, eat with avidity 
and impunity many weeds which cattle dislike and avoid. Many 
pastures grazed only with cattle are in spring time perfectly in bloom 
with weeds, which a few sheep mixed with the cattle would keep down. 
Horses when kept in a pasture to themselves are very unlevel grazers, 
but a few kept in a large cattle pasture will graze the rank places where 
cattle have left their manure and about gateplaces where the land has 
been trampled. 

It is better not to graze pastures very closely in any season of the 
year. Pastures when bare are much more likely to suffer from either 
drought or cold than when covered with grass two or three inches deep, 
and they grow much more slowly. All plants feed from the leaf as well 
as the root, and when cropped too closely the power of drawing nourish- 
ment and attracting moisture from the air is much lessened. Young turf 
requires specially careful grazing ; but it must be remembered that if 
allowed to get ahead in the early summer, it becomes overgrown and 
benty, and is rejected by cattle and sheep. And the aftergrowth of grass is 
hindered throughout the year by the old dry grass remaining on the land. 

Great improvements have been made in many pastures by drainage and 
top-dressing with bones, lime, guano, or other manures a subject which 
will be treated of under the head of draining and manures. 

Coarse weeds growing on pastures may be checked by mowing. The 
common thistle may be thoroughly checked by persistent spudding or 
drawing ; but in those pastures where it is very abundant this would be 
an endless task, and mowing is resorted to before the thistle is fully in 
flower. Nettles which are a sign of high condition, and often indicate 
the former site of a garden, may also be destroyed by repeated mowing. 

Grass land should be well grazed down in the early part of the 
summer, as if left to grow too long it becomes unpalatable to stock. In a very 
growing season, when grass gets ahead, and stock cannot be bought with 
a prospect of paying for their keep, the long grass which remains should 
be mown off and made into hay whenever the weather is suitable, or if not 
over plentiful, allowed to lie as " mulch " of which practice good examples 
occurred at the Ontario Experimental Farm in 1883. 



PERMANENT PASTURES. 515 

In some districts the custom prevails of mowing and grazing in alternate 
3 r ears. In practice it is found that this has not much to recommend it : 
and it is often an excuse for mowing land without properly manuring it. 
Land that has long been mown yearly and well manured, puts up varieties 
of grasses which grow up and ripen together about mowing time in July 
better than the grasses of an ordinary pasture will do. Nor will a field 
generally mown graze as evenly as a regular pasture. Many meadows 
are specially adapted for the growth of grasses for mowing, either from 
being capable of irrigation, or from being on a cool subsoil. When a 
meadow is on a shallow though not on a dry subsoil, it will, although well 
manured, fail to yield a good crop for hay in a hot, dry spring and 
summer, the flower stalks pushing up without much bottom grass. And 
such lands will generally be better grazed. 

In districts where there is a large proportion of arable land the mea- 
dows are often in poor condition. The whole of the farm dung is used on 
the plough land, and the meadows may be dressed with lime and soil, or 
other weak composts. This is, however, not true economy. Where farm 
dung cannot readily be spared, or where it would have to be hauled a 
long distance, or over difficult roads, its place may be well supplied by 300 
of bone manure. 

It is always best to secure an even crop of grass all over the land, the 
cost of mowing and haymaking not being proportionately greater with a 
full crop than with half a crop. By dressing all weak spots in a meadow 
at the end of April, when they may be detected, with a light dressing of 
nitrate of soda, this result may be obtained. Farm dung is best applied 
to the land either immediately after the hay is cleared, or in early autumn, 
after the early growth^of aftergrass has been fed off. Ten or fifteen loads 
per acre, equal to nearly as many tons, is a good dressing. It may also 
be applied any time in the winter, but with generally an inferior result 
than is realized from an earlier dressing. The dung, after being spread 
should be chain harrowed once or twice. If not got on before spring, and 
a dry season comes, the crop will be injured rather than benefited by it. 

Where the mowing meadows lie in such a situation and form that they 
can be readily irrigated with water either of natural fertilizing quality 
or mixed with sewage, they may be beneficially flooded in the winter and 
spring. The drainage from the farm buildings and yards, when collected 
in cesspools and mixed with sufficient volume of water to flow when 
flushed off by gravitation over a considerable area of land, will be very 
beneficial, and will produce heavy crops of somewhat coarse grass. When 
from the position of the barns, etc., or the scarcity of water, this cannot 



516 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP/EDI A. 

be done, the liquid manure should be collected into a tank, the rain water 
beino- excluded, and carted out in showery weather to the nearest meadow 
or other field requiring manure. Much catch water from land drainage 
and brook and river water is of little benefit except in a very dry season, 
and any outlay required to secure the use of it must be kept within mode- 
rate limits. When the main drain crosses a road, the water can be very 
simply utilized, of which there is a good example at the Ontario Experi- 
mental Farm. 

On the meadows cake and corn may be freely given to sheep, and the 
troughs regularly moved over the fields, the meadows will be put in high 
condition, a thick-set fine herbage being obtained in great abundance, 
with a better result in quality and quantity of produce than can be ob- 
tained by any other method of manuring. If the meadow be on a warm 
soil, it is specially desirable to get the land well covered with grass before 
hot weather comes. Meadows in very high condition on a cool subsoil 
can be grazed even in April without risk. Meadows and clover set apart 
for mowing require to be looked over in the spring, all sticks and stones 
being picked off, and then to be rolled. 

Permanent pastures are therefore sometimes treated as yielding annu- 
ally several cuttings of green fodder, taken to cattle in yard or stall. 

If ordinary land be seeded according to the tables of the seedsmen with 
the several sorts of grasses, each of the proper quality, which are found in 
good pasture, it will after the first free growth for a year or two generally 
diminish in productiveness becoming very disappointing indeed in the 
.5th or 6th year after which, if grazed and manured and liberally treated,, 
it will begin to improve, and may, 8 or 9 years thereafter, attain whatever 
rank as a pasture shall ultimately belong to it. And if instead of sowing 
an elaborate mixture of seeds, the common practice be followed of sowing' 
8 or lOlbs. of mixed clover seed, and some 30lbs, of mixed grasses of un- 
known composition, along with a barley crop, and the subsequent pasture 
be afterwards liberally treated mown the first year and thereafter not 
closely grazed (to which end sheep should not be allowed on it) the land 
being periodically liberally dressed, and bone-dust or superphosphate being 
applied the end will be that ultimately a fair pasture will be obtained. 
This will come about partly through the development of the best grasses 
which were sown, and partly by the gradual encroachment of the better 
grasses natural to the soil which have been unable to hold their own, or 
even to do more than that, under the liberal treatment given. 

The usual practice, however, when it is intended to lay a field down to 
grass, is, after draining and thorough cultivation, and manuring by means 



PERMANENT VASTUBE3. 517 

of a root crop, to sow a suitable mixture of grasses and clover with a light 
seeding of barley. This is done when the land is in good tilth, in April 
or May. The clovers are sown by themselves, and the mixed grasses at a 
second operation. The barley produces a crop, which is harvested ; and 
young cattle may keep the grass down the first autumn if there is an 
abundant growth : and the field may be mown the next year, being well 
manured in the autumn. It should therefore be grazed annually first 
with young stock, the cattle receiving at the same time some grain, thus 
enriching their manure, and adding to the fertility of the land. It should 
also be manured occasionally : bone-dust and superphosphate promoting 
the growth of the clovers ; and nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia 
promoting the growth of the grasses. In the course of a few years the land, 
if in a suitable climate, will become a good permanent pasture. 

But in order to obtain on old tilled land a good turf as easily as possible, 
it is the best policy to sow the seeds on land suitably prepared without any 
grain crop. One advantage of this plan is that if annual weeds spring up 
ahead of the clover, they maybe destroyed without injuring the clover 
by moving when 4 to 6 inches high, and any places in the field where the 
clover plant appears deficient can be re-sown at once. The risk of some of 
the small seeds being smothered by the growth of straw is also obviated. 

It is most important for the land to be clean, firm, level, and of good 
tilth before sowing the seeds. If the land be unlevel or rough, many of 
the small seeds sown will not germinate. If the land be foul it ma}' be 
better to delay the seeding a year, and take a crop of turnips or other roots, 
or even a summer fallow. Unless the field be in high condition, 200 or 
300 Ibs. per acre of prepared bone manure, should be well harrowed into 
the soil before sowing the seeds. This dressing may be repeated with ad- 
vantage, or 100 of nitrate of soda be substituted as a top-dressing when 
the young seeds are 3 or 4 inches high. It will generally be best to obtain 
a mixture of natural and artificial grasses and clovers specially adapted to 
the soil of the field, from one of our leading seedsmen, several of whom 
have already bestowed attention to the subject. 

The best time for sowing is from the middle of April to the middle of 
May, avoiding danger from spring frosts and summer drought. A dry, 
still day should be chosen, and it is better if there be a probability of an 
early fall of rain to start the seeds quickly. The land, being clean and 
level, should be harrowed with light harrows immediately before sowing 
the seeds, and rolled directly after. A very light harrow may sometimes 
be used with advantage after the seeds are sown, but unless lightly done 
some of the small seeds will be put too deep, and will not germinate. A 



518 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

seed harrow will be the best way of sowing the seeds, going twice over 
the land, once with the light grass seeds up and down the furrow, and 
then again the reverse way with the heavier clover seeds. An expert seeds- 
man will, however, on a still day sow the seeds evenly by hand. Where 
it is desired to sow permanent grass seeds on land already sown with fall 
wheat, the end of March or in April will be a suitable time, as the wheat 
plant will in some measure protect the young seeds from damage by frost. 
A light harrowing before sowing and rolling after will be all the tillage re- 
quired. 

When sown with spring grain, the seeds may be put in either directly 
after the grain is harrowed in, or in May, when it is well up, the roller being 
always used to cover them. Two or three Ibs. per acre of rape, is in some 
districts commonly sown without a grain crop, either with mixed clovers 
in alternate husbandry, or with permanent grass seeds. The rape and 
seeds are fed off together in the following autumn, and if cake be alsa 
given the young seeds are greatly enriched, and in fine weather the tread- 
ing of the sheep benefits the seeds. Young seeds should not be closely 
grazed the first year, or be trodden in wet weather by heavy stock. After 
frosts commence in fall stock should not be allowed to go upon them. 
Different opinions exist as to the best mode of treating the seeds the fol- 
lowing spring. They may either be mown early in June, taking care not 
to let them get overgrown, and afterwards fed, or they may be grazed 
throughout. A top-dressng of two or three hundred of bone-dust will 
in either case be often applied with advantage early in April. If, 83 
often happens when seeds are grazed, rough patches are left ungrazed 
these should be mown off. 

Where the land is naturally poor, or has been exhausted by a long 
course of tillage, a very liberal treatment will be required to bring it into 
profitable turf. A dressing of good dung or 300 Ibs. of bones, repeated 
light dressings of quick-acting manures, such as superphosphate, and the 
feeding of cake on the land, are all efficient means of improving the turf. 
Close feeding by sheep is deemed prejudicial, as they will pick out the 
clovers and finer grasses, and leave the coaser grasses to get the mastery. 
Where however cake is freely given, this objection is in some measure 
overcome, as the manure greatly enriched, thickens the turf, and sheep 
when having cake will more rapidly eat coarse food. 

Our present knowledge of the adaptability of the better grasses and 
clovers for permanent pasture in Canada, points to the following which 
we obtain frcm many trials at the Ontario Experimental Farm.

SOIL well stocked with the necessary ash ingredients 
of plants, and nitrogen ; in a good physical condition ; 
situated in a good climate, and possessing a good sub- 
soil, and a favourable aspect, are the necessary con- 
ditions of fertility. Each of these conditions has occu- 
pied attention elsewhere in these pages, and our next 
study must be that of those general principles which 
should be observed in order to secure the best crop with 
the least possible injury to, or the greatest possible im- 
provement of, the land. 

ROTATIONS. 

The idea of an orderly succession of crops is no doubt ancient. A high 
antiquity is accorded to this system by Mr. R. B. Morier when he speaks 
of it as one important aspect of the early Teutonic freeman even so far 
back as the first centuiy. How the idea of a rotation first originated may 
be readily guessed from the fact that the practice of growing a particular 
kind of crop year after year on the same land cannot be carried on long 



520 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

without evil effects. A limit has been reached, even in many of the most 
fertile soils of the States and Canada, where wheat cannot longer be grown. 

The first result of the exhaustion of land in a more or less nomad con- 
dition of society would be the migration of the cultivator to fresh fields, 
and the relinquishing of the worn-out lands to natural pasture. This in 
itself would be rest, and it is not necessary here to go over the reasons for 
the gradual recovery of such relinquished lands. Suffice it to say that 
fertility would in time return to them, and they would once more be cap- 
able of remunerative cultivation. This in itself would be a sort of rotation 
or alternation between a series of years in grain and a series of years in pas- 
ture. Convenience would suggest the advantage of sowing one portion of the 
land 'with spring grain and another with winter grain ; and systematic 
working of fallows would shorten the period necessary for renovating an 
exhausted field ; and the three-field course would thus gradually shape 
itself, and all the more readily as the increase of population rendered 
better cultivation imperative. 

Bearing in mind the disintegrating forces that are always at work in a 
soil, the benefits of a fallow no longer remain a mystery. What might 
require years to produce, if the soil were left entirely to nature, is accom- 
plished in a single season by pulverizing and aerifying effects of tillage 
implements, assisted, as they invariably are, by the action of the atmos- 
phere, moisture, and changes of temperature. 

The benefits of a fallow were known to the Israelites, who were required 
to fallow all their land once in seven years. The Romans introduced the 
practice into England ; but a systematic tillage of bare fallows is said to 
have been unknown in Scotland till about a hundred years since. The 
old three-field course is still practised in certain stiff land districts. It 
consists in taking a crop of wheat, followed by beans, oats, or sometimes 
clover, and the third year it is fallowed. Such a system is not likely to 
be rernunerativ & at present grain prices, and if a better system of cropping 
cannot be profitably introduced, such lands ought to be laid away to 
permanent pasture. In the better classes of clay lands, bare fallows are 
made occasionally, if a field is exceptionally foul, or when the season is 
unpropitious for root cultivation. As the quality of the clay land rises, the 
intervals between the fallows are lengthened. 



B 



PKINCIPLES ON WHICH ROTATIONS ARE CONSTRUCTED. 

A clear view of the principles which should guide an agriculturist in 
constructing rotations will be best obtained by dividing all soils, in the 



THE CULTIVATION OF FARM CROPS. 521 

first place, into heavy and light, or stiff and free. The treatment of these 
two classes of soils is about as opposite as it well can be. 

Stiff soils are essentially suitable for corn or grain crops. Hence in 
examples of rotations it will be found that the proportion devoted to 
grain in some form is respectively , J, and i. Such lands are called 
" wheat and bean land," because the}' are most suitable for these crops. 
They are unsuitable for the growth of turnips and swedes for two reasons. 
First, the difficulty and expense of obtaining a sufficiently fine tilth in 
the spring and early summer ; /Secondly, because it is troublesome, and 
often injurious, to cart off the produce in the autumn, and certainly in- 
jurious to consume it upon the land. The underlying reason for both of 
these difficulties is the plastic character of clay soils. They must be light- 
ened up, being already too close in texture. It is fatal to success to plough 
or work them when wet, and consequently hauling or folding sheep upon 
them, as in some countries, is sure to be followed by a diminished wheat 
crop the succeeding year. Now, as the turnip and swede crop are grown 
with the idea of iniprovlng land, and causing it to grow a better grain 
crop, it is evident that on these stiff soils their cultivation cannot extend. 
There are, however, other fallow crops which may be grown upon clay 
lands. All forage crops which are eaten by live stock during the dry 
months, and are cleared off in time for wheat sowing in the autumn, are 
fit for clay soils. Such are winter and spring vetches, rape, and cabbages. 
All these crops are ready for use from May to the end of September or 
October. Stiff clay soils should, for the same reason, be manured with 
long or fresh manure, so that the decay of the straw and fermentation of 
the dung may open up and divide the soil. Autumn ploughing for fallow 
crops is also advisable, that the pulverizing effects of the winter's frost 
may be thoroughly realized. 

Fi'i/e soils are suitable for turnips and forage crops in general. They 
are defined in farming phraseology as " turnip and barley soils," because 
they grow both crops to perfection. It will be found that one-half of the 
arable land is usually devoted to each purpose, i.e., grain and fodder crops. 
They are suitable for turnips, as they are readily reduced to a fine tilth. 
A policy of consolidation is noticed throughout the course of cropping. 
They are often intentionally ploughed wet for grain ; the leas are heavily 
rolled or land-pressed before wheat is sown ; the young grain is also rolled 
in the spring to press the soil around the roots ; and the manure is pre- 
ferred well rotted. Such land is ploughed shallow for grain, and stubble 
and haulm or weeds are raked together and burnt, rather than ploughed 



522 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

in. All these precautions have one end in view, namely, preventing 
" hollowness " and promoting firmness. 

GENERAL EFFECTS OF GRAIN, " ROOT," AND FORAGE CROPS UPON THE 

LAND. 

Grain crops exhaust the land (1) because they are sold off the pre- 
mises ; (2) because on account of the narrow spaces between the rows, and 
the length of time they occupy the land, they do not allow of the thorough 
destruction of weeds. Land long under grain crops is apt to become both 
poor and foul. 

Root crops are well calculated to take the place of the old bare or naked 
fallow on a large class of soils. (1.) They are not sown until May, June, and 
July; and, therefore, allow ample opportunity for cultivation from the secur- 
ing of the previous grain crops in August or September until next summer. 
(2) They do not thrive unless the land is fine and well-manured. (3) They 
are sown at wide intervals, and constantly hoed and kept clean during 
their growth. (4) They are consumed upon the farm, and therefore keep 
up the fertility and increase the manure heap. As the object of the fallow 
is to clean and enrich the land, it will be seen that its functions are in no 
way interfered with by the growth of the roots. If root crops were sold 
(as occasionally they are), they would be even more exhausting to the land 
than the growth of grain crops. On the other hand, if grain is con- 
sumed (as it sometimes is) upon the farm, as when peas or barley are 
ground up for stock, they may themselves be viewed as renovating 
crops. 

Fodder crops are understood to be those crops grown for summer keep, 
and for the sake of leaves and stem, rather than for the root or grain 
Such are vetches, rye, clover, lucerne, trifolium, and rape. Some of them 
are sown upon the fallow selection, and others are used to divide two 
grain-crops, as when clover comes between barley and wheat in the Nor- 
folk four-course rotation. Others again are mere " catch-crops," or stolen 
crops, as when rape, or even stubble turnips are taken after a wheat stub- 
ble, with the intention of providing extra keep in times of scarcity, or in 
the early spring. With respect to the first use of forage crops, they have 
been already recommended for clay lands. As to catch-cropping, or the 
taking of roots after vetches or trifolium, in the same season, we must re- 
member that by so doing one great advantage of 4 the fallowing season is 
lost, because the land is occupied with these two crops from autumn 
throughout the whole season. This seriously interferes with the proper 



THE CULTIVATION OF FARM CHOPS. 523 

cleaning of the land. It is a plan often resorted to in order to obtain sheep 
keep, but it should only be practised when the land is clean, and if con- 
tinued it is apt to render it foul. 

THEORY OF ROTATIONS. 

1. When we compare the com position of some of our ordinary crops with 
each other, we find that the proportion of ash ingredients and nitrogen 
differ widely. This is in itself a key to one of the advantages of a rotation. 
If the same crop be grown year after year upon the same field, the soil is 
called upon to deliver up certain constituents in large quantities, while 
others are allowed to remain untouched. Turnips remove five times, beans 
three tyaaes, and oats twice as much potash from a soil as wheat. Oats 
require almost five times as much lime as wheat ; and barley takes twenty- 
six times the amount of silica from the land as an equivalent crop of 
wheat. Such illustrations might be multiplied, but the above examples 
sufficiently show that a succession of crops must be a relief to the drain 
upon certain constituents. 

2. Plants search for their food differently. A plant which feeds in the 
upper layers of the soil, like peas or barley, is not likely to exhaust land 
for deeper-rooted crops, such as beans or red clover. The contrast between 
the root distribution of wheat and barley has been noticed by Mr. Lawea 
and Dr. Gilbert, who grew these two plants in pots. Only one fibre of 
barley found its way through the bottom of the pot, but " the wheat threw 
out such a mass of ramifications that the whole surface of the dish in 
which the pot rested was covered with a thick network of roots, as also 
was the bottom, and to a great extent the sides of the inside of the pot 
itself. The barley roots were congregated near the surface, and were more 
sparingly developed. 

3. Certain plants or crops are especially fitted to precede others. Legu- 
.minous crops, as beans, peas, and clover are, for example, excellent precur- 
sors of wheat. The reason is that these plants have a store of nitrogen 
available for the wheat crop, in the form of roots, and through the fall of 
'the leaf during their growth. A good crop of clover assists in securing 
a good crop of wheat. Turnips and other root crops and potatoes are 
(favourable to the after-success of grain crops. Hence we shall find in most 
rotations that the succession of crops is determined by the nature of the 
preceding crop. 

4. Certain crops seem to injure the soil for other crops. As might be 
expected, crops similar to each other do not succeed well in succession. 



324 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Rye-grass is not a good preparation for wheat, and two white straw crops 
are not, as a rule, likely to succeed. Red clover refuses to grow after a 
previous crop or crops of the same plant, and it is well known that pota- 
toes and turnips may be grown too frequently on the same field. This may 
be best explained upon the theory of rivalry for similar food constituents. 
De Candolle, the eminent French botanist, advanced the theory of root- 
excretions, to account for the difficulty of growing certain plants in suc- 
cession, but the latest investigations upon this subject have yielded only 
negative results. 

5. Besides the foregoing scientific reasons for varying the cropping of 
Celds and following a well-devised rotation, there are several practical 
considerations which confirm their usefulness. (1) they promote cleanli- 
ness or freedom from weeds ; (2.) They give a continuous supply of food 
for stock, as well as grain for man ; (3) they divide the labour of the farm 
over the entire year ; (4) give a system to farming operations ; (5) and 
diminish a farmer's risks. 

ABUSES OF ROTATIONS. They are, however, liable to abuse when un- 
duly strained. No rotation can be suitable to all soils and to all conditions 
of the market, and therefore, a degree of latitude should be allowed, espe- 
cially upon large farms, where soils and climates vary. 

INFLUENCE OF SOIL IN DETERMINING ROTATIONS. The general out- 
line of a rotation may be thus drawn : 

Fallow : grain : forage : grain. 

The fallow may be naked or cropped, and the cropping of a fallow is ca- 
pable of many modifications, according to the quality of the land. Simi- 
larly the grain crops and forage crops will be selected according to the ca- 
pabilities and adaptabilities of the soil. 

On the most retentive clays wheat and beans will be the predominating 
cereals, and bare fallows relieved by the limited cultivation of rape, vetches 
will constitute the fallow portion. 

On strong clay loams wheat and beans still hold their place, but the 
fallow will be cropped with mangels and part swedes, in addition to the 
crops cultivated on the stiffer clays. 

On loamy soils any crop is suitable a fact which makes them particu- 
larly valuable. Potatoes may be mentioned as especially suitable for this 
class. 

On sandy loams and sandy soils, white turnips are more suitable than 
swedes in England, forage crops are very succesful, and these soils .being 
easily worked are kept constantly under crop, and require the consolidat- 



THE CULTIVATION OF FARM CROPS. 59- 

ing action of sheep during the fall. For such soils a system of catch-crop- 
ping is peculiarly suitable. Rye and barley will be found the most suit- 
able cereals. 

Calcareous soils are favourable to the developmentof those crops which 
require much lime. Among these may be mentioned the clovers, vetches 
lucerne, peas, and beans. All these leguminous plants are in hifh favour 
in limestone districts. 

Peaty soils will grow heavy crops of oats, and are well adapted for the 
growth of rape, while they are not suitable for turnips, or mangel. 

Thin soils with rock near the surface, although naturally poor, are ca- 
pable of growing a capital quality of barley, and are suitable for the win- 
ter feeding of sheep by folding, where climate allows. 

Deep soils will grow carrots well, and are good for almost any kind of 
crop. 

All soils are to some degree capable of growing all crops. Therefore 
we shall find it advisable merely to modify a rotation according to the 
leading character of a soil, and by no means to adhere exclusively to the 
class of crops mentioned as peculiarly suitable. 

Rotations in practice : The two-years' course being condemned as too 
short, led to a three-years' rotation. On good lands it was (1) Wheat, 

(2) Clover, (3) Potatoes, turnips, &c. ; on inferior soils, oats and barley 
took the place of wheat. This rotation was favourable for cleaning the 
land, and yielded a large quantity of manure ; but the proportion of fal- 
low crop was too great for economy in working ; and the clover would not 
bear such frequent repetition. 

In some districts the three-years' course was (1) Wheat, (2) Turnips, 

(3) Spring grain. This was the opposite extreme, as it gave too large a 
proportion under grain crop ; and being found too exhausting on licrht 
soils, clover was introduced between the spring grain and the wheat, the- 
result being the old standard Norfolk 4-course

:[n this rotation the grain and green crop alternate in equal proportions, 
ind of the green crops one is a fallow and therefore a cleaning crop, and 
Doth are also ameliorating crops. The succession of the crops in this 
:ourse is also such that the whole of the manure is made use of; those 
jarts of it which are not fitted for one crop, furnishing nourishment for

another. This rotation if practised, more or less, in every country, and is 
not confined to light soils only ; wheat and mangels on the heavier soils 
taking the place of barley and turnips. 

The great value of this rotation is that it admits of endless variation in 
the cropping, without departing from its main features. Thus, instead of 
taking turnips every fourth year, interchanges may be made of swedes, 
mangel, carrots, potatoes, etc. ; and instead of clover every fourth year, a 
crop of beans, peas, vetches may be taken, thus bringing in turnips or 
clover at intervals of 8, 12, 16 &c. years, instead of every fourth year. 

A good example of the five years' course is 

1st year, Wheat. 

2nd " Roots and Green Crops. 

3rd " Wheat. 

4th " Barley. 

5th " Seeds. 

Which, of course, is but the Norfolk course extended by the introduction 
of a second wheat crop before the barley, a practice which on land full of 
manure, will improve the barley while at the same time the clover is thus 
less frequently repeated. 

The six-year rotations now practised may be represented by the follow- 
ing:

Owing to the increasing cost of labour and tillage, many farmers are 
now working on one or other of these crop rotations. Three years under 
grass seeds is common, and by this system half the land is under clover 
or grass, one-third under grain, and one-sixth under root crop. 

The seven and eight is that which was adopted at The Ontario Ex- 
perimental Farm, for the purpose of getting-up impoverished, dirty soil of 
various physical characters from gravel to clay loam :

A perfect rotation should include all those crops which the soil, climate, 
and situation of the farm will admit of being cultivated at a profit. The 
conditions which influence the species of crops grown, are (a) the nature 
of the soil, (6) the character of the climate, (c) the kinds of live stock kept, 
and systems of management, (rf) the demand for certain crops, and the 
convenience for marketing them. Thus in regard to soils, clays are speci- 
ally fitted to produce crops of wheat, beans, and mangels ; light soils are 
favourable to the growth of barley, turnips, peas, and clover ; and peaty 
soils may yield excellent crops of carrots, rape, and oats, &c. The condi- 
tions of climate have great influence on the cropping. A dry climate is 
more favourable to the cultivation of wheat, barley, and leguminous plants, 
than to the development of root or green crops. In moist climates the 
humidity of the summer is unfavourable to the growth of wheat, barley, 
peas and beans, but favourable to turnips, rape, grass, and oats ; while a 
mild winter is favourable for growing early spring food, and market pro- 
duce, such as rye, early potatoes, &c. In a mountain climate the compa- 
rative shortness of the summer season is more prejudicial to grain crops 
than to roots and grass. On humid elevations oats are the most suitable 
grain crop ; whilst on dry soils, barley is more appropriate. Again, as to 
kinds of live stock, and management. Cattle require a greater breadth of 
straw and forage crops than of root crops to be eaten on the ground ; sheep 
the reverse. Dairy stock require more of succulent green food than they 
do of dry fodder ; fattening animals the reverse. 

ORDINARY TILLAGE OPERATIONS. 

Whatever the physical or chemical properties of the soil may be, it will 
produce but little if not well tilled. And what is true in this respect of 
the best soil applies in far stronger terms to the worst. 

Apart from its immediate end, the provision of a proper seed-bed, the 
objects and effects of tillage may be enumerated thus : 

(1) To stir and loosen the entire soil to a sufficient depth, so that 
the roots of plants may freely extend themselves in search 
of food. 



528 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

(2) To pulverize the soil and mix thoroughly its constituent parts. 

so as to increase its absorbent and retentive powers, and 
to effect an equal and economical distribution of manure. 

(3) To destroy weeds and foreign plants, which rob the crop of 

food and check its growth. 

Let us add that, by opening the soil, and rendering it permeable to air 
and water, the inert materials contained in it, both organic and inorganic, 
are convertible into soluble plant food. And in regard to many of the 
insects which prey upon our crops, especially such as work beneath the soil 
at the roots of plants, frequent tillage is found to disturb them and bring 
them to the surface, where they get picked up by birds or die. 

Tillage operations include all soil operations which apply directly to the 
cultivation of farm crops ploughing, cultivating, harrowing, aud rolling, 
or whatever else is done to bring land to a proper state to receive the 
seed. They also include the operations of hoeing and weeding the ground 
after it is sown. 

PLOUGHING. In ploughing we break up the ground into furrow slices, 
turning them over in such a manner that a new surface is presented to 
the atmosphere. This or some other mode of loosening and turning up 
the under parts of soils is necessary to fit them for the reception of the 
seed and the growth of crops. 

The object of ploughing being to expose the upturned soil to the atmos- 
phere and to create the greatest quantity of mould the furrow-slices can 
produce, it follows that the furrow-slice which shows the greatest surfa<'i 
will answer these ends most effectually. In the case of a square-cut fur- 
row-slice this is found to result when it is laid at an angle of forty-five 
decrees ; and to this end its width must be to its depth as about ten to 
seven. If the furrow-slices are ragged, open and broken, and if, being 
cut of various depths and widths, they are laid at different heights, tin: 
work is inferior. A uniform depth of tilth cannot be provided by the 
harrow, and the seed will be unequally buried. 

The points of merit in ploughing are: (1) a straight furrow of uniform 
width and depth; (2) a clean cut slice, both on its land side and floor ; 
:. a well laid furrow-slice, having regard to compactness and form ; 4- 
complete burial of the gi*ass or stubble turned in ; (.">) a uniformly ploughed 
ridge : (G) a finish showing an open furrow with a clean narrow bottom, 
the last furrow-slice being equal in width and height with the others. 

CULTIVATING OR STIRRING. The cultivator merely stirs the soil and 
does not turn it over like the plough ; but it can work to an equal depth. 
It is especially useful in a spring fallow after autumn ploughing, as the

winter-weathered tilth is thereby retained on the surface, and the moist- 
ure of the soil is less evaporated than when the land is spring ploughed 
a point of the first importance in turnip cultivation. It is also much used 
in preparing light land just cleared of roots for being sown with spring 
grain and seeds, as it furnishes a fine mould and keeps the manure near 
the surface. Fitted with broad points, and worked at a shallower depth, 
the cultivator is the most effective implement in uss for stubble cleaning 
f after harvest. The substitution, when possible, of the cultivator for the 
plough is attended with a considerable saving both of time and labour. 

Cultivators are adapted for either two or four horses, though the same 
implement which can be worked with ease by two horses ona lio-ht soil 
or at a shallow depth, will often require three or four horses on stiff land, 
or where deeper working has to be practised. If the nature of the soil 
and work admits of it, however, two horses in a light cultivator will do 
more than halt the work of four yoked to a larger implement, as they step 
more freely and with greater ease to themselves. On light land, a two- 
horse cultivator should work five acres of fallow to a depth of about six 
inches, and four acres to a less depth on land where roots have been fed 
off; on stiff land, or working to a greater depth, a three or four-horse cul- 
tivator would do about six acres in a day. 

HARROWING (1) pulverizes the soil to a depth of two or three inches, 
and reduces to fineness the surface clods and lumps that are left after 
ploughing or cultivating; (2) it shakes out and separates the weeds that 
are in the soil ; (3) it smooths surface inequalities, by which means the 
seed is more evenly deposited and is more likely to have a uniform germ- 
ination ; and (4;, after the seed is sown, the harrow buries it at a mode- 
rate depth beneath the surface. We might add a fifth use ; for it is in 
many cases a good practice to harrow the winter-sown wheat in spring, 
and break up the weathered pan upon the surface. The usual direction 
of harrowing after seed is sown is first along the furrow, then across, 
and finally along again. 

ROLLING (1) breaks those clods or lumps which have resisted the action 
of the harrow ; (2) it presses down surface stones, etc., so as to be out of 
the way of the scythe or reaping machine ; (3) it gives a greater degree of 
compactness to soil which is too light and friable, making it firmer around 
the roots of plants, and at the same time a less favourable breeding- 
ground for many kinds of insects ; while the smoother surface presents 
fewer points of evaporation ; (4) it presses down and makes firm the 
ground about newly-sown seeds ; and sometimes (5), when very small 
seeds are to be sown, it is well to roll the ground first, so as to level it 

trtr

530 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

thoroughly and facilitate a more equal distribution of the seed than could 
otherwise take place ; (6) it is used to press into the ground the roots of 
those plants sown in the preceding autumn which have been detached by 
frost. 

A spring rolling on a field of winter grain will often, by firming the soil 
about its roots, save the crop ; and it is equally beneficial in a similar way 
on grass lands. On light soils the loosening effects of frequent freezing 
and thawing are more or less avoided by an autumn rolling. Grass land* 
cannot be too heavily rolled ; and on all light lands under tillage the use 
of the roller is indispensable for closing the pores and preventing the 
evaporation of moisture. 

But while rolling is much benefit on light, porous, and lumpy soils, it 
is injurious on wet clays, except in dry weather, when they are lumpy 
after ploughing. Rolling a stiff soil when wet renders it more difficult of 
cultivation, by pressing the particles still more closely together and pre- 
venting the admission of air. Even light arable lands require the ground 
to be dry when rolled, if for no other reason than that otherwise the soil 
will adhere to the roller. Grass land, however, is best rolled in showery 
weather. 

HOEING. This operation is proceeded with while the crop is growing, 
and it fulfils two important objects. First, it extirpates weeds and keeps 
the land clean ; and secondly, it stirs, loosens, and pulverizes the surface 
soil. The extirpation of weeds is of course indispensable to good cultiva- 
tion. But the second principle of hoeing is if possible still more impor- 
tant. Deep and continuous hoeing is wonderfully effective in promoting 
the growth of plants. It prevents the soil reverting to its natural solidity, 
admits air and water, and by breaking and subdividing it, causes it to 
retain moisture and to present innumerable surfaces and fresh particles to 
the ydung roots. The effect is visible in the faster growth of the plants 
every time the earth is stirred about them. 

Hoeing, however, can be practised in the case of crops in drills or in 
hills. Broadcast work is thus incompatible with thorough cultivation, 
even in the case of grain crops. If horse-hoeing is intended among the 
grain crops, the drilling should correspond with the horse-hoe to be used. 
Drilling is equally indispensable to all hand-hoeing. 

STEAM CULTIVATION. In many cases tillage by the wealthy farmer 
may, in part at least, be advantageously performed by steam power. It 

(1) gives cheaper, deeper, and more efficient tillage than horse power ; it 

(2) enables the work to be done rapidly and at the best season ; it (3) en- 
ables land to be more quickly and effectually cleaned and kept free from 



THE CULTIVATION OF FARM CROPS. 53! 

weeds ; it (4) promotes good drainage by rendering tenacious soils more 
friable and porous ; and it (5) not only effects a considerable diminution 
in the number of horses,but,by relieving them of their heaviest work en- 
ables you to keep those which are still necessary at less expense. 

Of the two main systems of cultivating by steam, the double-engine 
system necessarily involves the largest outlay to begin with ; but where 
the farm is large enough to afford a reasonable amount of work for the 
tackle, it will cultivate at a less cost per acre than the sino-le enoine 
lystem. 

BARE FALLOW. A bare fallow is one of the oldest modes of preparing 
soil for wheat. The soil is ploughed, and exposed a whole year to atmos- 
pheric influences, and finally sown with wheat. In the case of a clay soil, 
this treatment would probably lead to the following results : 1. An im- 
provement in the mechanical texture of the soil. 2. The disintegration 
of some of the mineral silicates, whereby potash and other necessary ash 
constituents of plants would be liberated and made available for vegeta- 
tion. 3. The absorption of ammonia from the atmosphere by the soil. 
4. The receipt of both ammonia and nitric acid from the air in the form 
of rain. 5. The oxidation of ammonia, and of the vegetable remains in 
the soil, nitric acid being produced. 

The production of nitric acid is probably the most important result of a 
bare fallow. In soils at Rothamsted left as bare fallow, there has been 
found at the end of the summer 34 55 Ib. of nitrogen per acre in form of 
nitric acid in the first 20 inches from the surface. Supposing the season 
of fallow is a fairly dry one, the increase in the available nitrogenous food 
will probably enable the soil to produce twice as much wheatas it could 
do without this treatment. If, however, the soil is exposed to heavy rain, 
the nitrates produced will be more or less washed out, and the benefit of 
the fallow greatly diminished. Bare fallow can be used systematically 
with advantage only on clay soils having a considerable absorptive power 
for ammonia, and in a tolerably dry climate ; under other circumstances a 
continuance of the practice must issue in a serious loss of soil nitrogen. 

GEALN CROPS. 

WHEAT. The soil best adapted to the growth of wheat is a deep loam 
inclined to clay, with a dry subsoil heavy land, more or less compact. 
Practically, however, nearly every kind of land, whether clay, loam, chalk, 
gravel or sand, will produce fair crops of wheat if in good condition, un- 
less where the climate is really unfavourable for the purpose. It is not 



532 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

the rainfall so much as the temperature that appears to govern the extent 
and prevalence of wheat-growing, for in some of the wetter districts capital 
wheat is produced. Wheat, as is well known, is more sensitive of tem- 
perature than any other of the cereals. Latitude, altitude, and exposure 
mainly regulate temperature. 

A summer fallow is now less frequently resorted to as a preparation for 
winter wheat than formerly, and wheat generally occupies a place in the 
rotation following clover and roots. A fine tilth, which is so desirable 
for spring grain, is not specially required for autumn sown wheat, nor is a 
veiy dry^seed-bed approved of. The time of sowing is very much a mat- 
ter of local experience, and is more or less regulated by the weather and 
fitness of the ground. Middle of September, for Ontario, is the common 
seed-time. Bare fallows are, as a rule, seeded earlier. Light land is sel- 
dom too wet for sowing winter wheat, but when a good tilth is obtained 
on heavy soils it is better to sow than run the risk of wet weather setting 
in that might delay the work unduly. 

The quantity of seed to be sown on the acre is very various and has 
criven rise to controversy. That quantity is best which yields the largest 
crop, and the solution of that point rests on the experience of the indivi- 
dual' grower. The answer depends on many considerations; the quality 
and condition of the land, the climate, the goodness of the seed, the time 
of sowing, and the mode of sowing. One bushel per acre may suffice 
where the conditions are all favourable ; six pecks are a common seeding : 
and even three bushels may not be found too much under other circum- 
stances. Whatever be the quantity, it is desirable that the ground be 
fairly occupied by plants when the spring and early summer growth com- 
mences. It is not now common to seed land so thickly as was done for- 
merly, when broadcast sowing was common ; but our forefathers were not 
fools, and if the plants had not stood close together in the days of weeds 
and wet land, the weeds would have over-mastered the grain. 

In cold and elevated districts what is called " thin seeding " is never 
practised and, as a rule, the most seed is sown on the poorer soils, as the 
plants on such land do not tiller, and therefore a greater number of roots 
are wanted. This has been controverted by ingeuious persons, who in- 
quire, if ten plants require one foot of land to perfect their growth, what 
effect may be expected but starvation if twenty plants are grown on the 
same space ? Experience, however, outweighs theoretical considerations. 
The plant when small and week occupies less space, and in consequence 
more stems or stalks are then required for mutual shelter and support 



THE CULTIVATION OF FARM CROPS. 533 

and without a considerable number of straws the crop may break down 
before reaping time. 

Grain is sown by drill and by broadcasting with hand or "machine. 
Two bushels per acre broadcast is not in its result a thicker seeding than 
1| bushels if drilled. Broadcasting is the cheapest and most expeditious 
method of sowing ; but the sowing of grain in rows by the drill has three 
main advantages over broadcasting, viz., the saving of seed, the ability to 
hoe the spaces between the rows in spring if necessary, and the deposit of 
the seed at equal and uniform depth in the soil. Eight to ten inches are 
the common distances between row and row. When of less width the in- 
tervals cannot be well hand or horse-hoed. Where there are no weeds to 
keep down, and where a baked surface only requires stirring and break - 
'ng, that can be done expeditiously and economically by the common har- 
row, and broadcasting may be perfectly satisfactory, Wheat stands, and 
even improves, under a considerable amount of rough handling in spring; 
aud where the land is clean it is much the same whether it be sown broad- 
cast or drilled. 

SPRING WHEAT requires a soil similar to that of winter grain, but it 
should be of a quick and kindly character, as it has a much shorter time 
to mature. The ground should be well pulverized and fertile. The best 
crops are raised on land that has been ploughed in the fall, after roots were 
manured, and sown without additional ploughing, taking care to harrow in 
thoroughly. When planted early the wheat rarely suffers from the fly, 
as it attains a size and vigor beyond the reach of injury before it appears. 
In certain localities where the fly abounds and the wheat has not been 
early sown, it is found necessary to keep back the young plants till the 
disappearance of the Qy. 

Wheat of any class is ready for reaping as soon as the berry or grain 
is hard enough to yield no milkey juice when squeezed. The later stages 
of the ripening process do little else than thicken the bran coat of 
the grain and diminish its yield of flour. This subject has been 
thoroughly investigated by rigorous experiment, that both the quality 
and the quantity of the produce are improved by early harvesting. The 
crop is cut by scythe, by the reaping machine, or self-binder. The crop 
is set up in stocks or shocks, five sheaves on a side, with or without top 
sheaves for further protection, until it is dry, and it is then hauled to the 
barn or stack. 

BARLEY. The soils best adapted for barley are good turnip lands 
calcareous, loamy, and friable and the crop generally follows turnips. 



534 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

The lighter soils in early districts are, however, the best adapted to 
the growth of the finer qualities of malting barley. It delights in a free 
open soil, being a shallow-rooted plant and a rapid grower, It requires a 
liberal supply of ready -prepared and easily assimilated manures within 
its reach, and thus is well adapted to follow sheep on the lighter soils. 
On -the heavier soils, it pays well for a liberal dressing of artificial 
fertilisers. Superphosphate of lime, applied at the rate of 200 to 300 Ibs. 
per acre at the seed time, is found to promote early ripening and pro- 
ductiveness. 

It may be sown as soon as the ground is sufficiently dry in spring, on a 
grass or clover lay, turned over the preceding fall ; or it may follow a 
well manured and cleanly hoed crop. If sown on a sod it should be 
lightly ploughed in, but not so deep as to disturb it, and afterwards 
harrowed or rolled. The soil should always be well pulverized. From 
two to three bushels per acre is the usual allowance of seed, poor and 
mellow soils, and early sown, requiring the least. 

OATS. In this country oats are sown at the rate of two to four bushels 
per acre during all the spring months, and sometimes, though rarely, in 
June. The seed should be well harrowed in and rolled, and no after 
attention is required except to destroy the prominent weeds. 

Oats are better to be cut before they are fully ripe. When left till 
ripe the crop is very liable to be shed by a high wind. The straw of 
oats is far better fodder than that of wheat or barley, especially when 
they are early cut ; indeed, sometimes the straw is almost as good as 

hay. 

RYE is the hardiest grain cultivated, growing better than any other on 
the poorest sandy soils. It was once extensively grown in English 
agriculture, but its cultivation, except for use cut down green as forage, 
has much declined, though it is still largely grown in the Northern and 
Western States and Canada. 

It may be grown on dry, poor and sandy soils, that will grow no other 
crop ; and yet a rich sandy loam is most suitable. 

It is sown in autumn at the rate of one to two bushels an acre the 
smaller quantity when intended to stand as a seed crop, and the larger- 
quantity when intended for early green food in spring. 

The cultivation and harvesting of the rye crop is similar to that of 
wheat. When grown for forage it may be sown as early as August. 



THE CULTIVATION OF FARM CROPS. 53.5 

CORN (Maize). 

The soil for corn must be dry, rich and well pulverized. Neither strong 
clay, wet, or poor lands, will yield good crops of corn. Land can scarcely 
be too rich for it, and the fresher and less fermented the manure applied 
to it is, unless on light, sandy soils, the better it will be for the crop. A 
great error is committed in raising corn, as with most of our tillage crops, 
from not having the soil sufficiently enriched ; though this error is dimin- 
ished in the case of such as will not bear an excess of manure. Corn is a 
gross feeder, and necessarily ranges over a great space in search of food. 
It has a large amount of stalk, leaves and grain to provide for in a few 
weeks, and its increase will be commensurate with the supply of food. 

A clover lay, or rich grass sod is an excellent preparation for corn, with 
the addition of manure when required. But the manure should always 
be scattered broadcast, ploughed and well harrowed in. The roots will be 
certain to find it, and in consequence of its general diffusion, the develop- 
ment of the ear and grain will correspond with that of the stalk and le:i\v<. 
When manured in the hill, on poor soil, it comes forward early, and this 
induces an extension of the roots, which finding little support, the crop is 
limited to the stalk and leaves, and a smaller proportion of grain. 

Corn may be planted in hills from three to four and one-half feet asun- 
der, and from three to five stalks well spread in each hill, according to the 
kind of seed, quality of land, etc. Some plant in drills, but this is objec- 
tionable, as the trouble of cultivation is greater, without increasing the 
yield. Thick planting gives fewer ears upon a stalk, and those of less 
size. The time of planting in the North is usually within the three first 
weeks of May, depending much on the season. Late frosts will sometimes 
cut down the first leaves without destroying the germ, but it is always 
best to defer planting till all apprehensions of it are removed. In the 
South earlier planting is desirable, and it is there put into the ground in 
March and April. To give regularity to the rows and facilitate after-cul- 
ture, the furrows for the seed should be struck out each way with the 
utmost exactness, and twice the corn planted that is required to remain. 
It should be covered about two inches. The surplus plants can be pulled 
up at the second hoeing, when all fear of injury is past. If the land is 
light, it should be laid flat before planting, and after this it should be 
thoroughly rolled. Corn-planting implements, by hand and horse power, 
have lately been introduced to great advantage over the old way of hand 
and hoe planting. 



536 THE HOME, FAUM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

The ground may be stirred when the plants first show themselves. This 
is most economically done with the cultivator or light plough, and if the 
operation be frequent and thorough, there will be little use for the hoe. 
Hilling or heaping the earth around the plants should always be avoided, 
except with very heavy soil, or such as is liable to an excess of moisture ; 
in all other cases it should remain flat. Stirring the ground in dry wea- 
ther is peculiarly beneficial to corn and all hoed crops. Some omit it then 
from fear of the escape of moisture, but its effect is precisely the reverse, 
as nothing so certainly produces lightness, porosity and unevenness in the 
soil, which, under the head of soils and draining, we have shown facili- 
tated the admission and escape of heat, that inevitably secures the deposit 
of large quantities of moisture, even in the driest and most sultry wea- 
ther. Corn and other crops, which were withering from excessive 
drought, have been at once rescued from its effects by a thorough use of 
the plough and cultivator. Well drained, dark coloured and rich porous 
soils will be found to suffer much less in drought than others which lack 
these characteristics. 

HARVESTING. If there be no danger of early frost, the corn may be 
suffered to stand until fully ripe ; though if the stalks are designed for 
fodder they are better to be cut when the grain is well glazed, and this 
should be done in all cases where frost is expected. Scarcely any injury 
occurs either to the leaf or grain if the corn be stocked, when both would 
be seriously damaged from the same exposure if standing. 

BUCKWHEAT (Polygonum fagopyrum). 

Is a grain much cultivated in this country. It grows freely on light 
soils, but yields a remunerating crop only on those which are fertile. 
Fresh manure is injurious to this grain. Sandy loams are its favourite 
soils, especially such as have lain long in pasture and these should be well 
ploughed and harrowed. It may be sown from the first of May to the tenth 
of August, but in the North this ought to be done as early as June or July, 
or it may be injured by early frosts, which are fatal to it. It is sown 
broadcast at the rate of two to four pecks per acre, and harvested when 
the earliest seed is fully ripe. The plant often continues flowering after 
this, and when the early seed is blighted, as is often the case, the plant 
may be left till these last have matured. As it is liable to heat, it should 
be placed in little stooks, of the size of a two bushel basket, over the field 
and as soon as dry, taken in and threshed out. If riot perfectly dry, the 
straw may be stacked with layers of other straw. 



THE CULTIVATION OF FAKM CROPS. 537 

BEAXS. The bean is partial to a quick, dry soil, too great strength or 
fresh manuring giving a large quantity of vine without a corresponding 
quantity of fruit. 

The land should be finely pulverized, and if at all inclined to wet it 
should be ridged. Beans are tender plants and will not bear the slightest 
frost, and as they grow rapidly, they will be sure to ripen if planted when 
this is no longer to be apprehended. The seed is exposed to rot if put into 
the ground in a cold, wet time, and the land should, therefore, be previ- 
ously well warmed by the sun. The bush beans are the only kind used 
for field planting, and of these there are several sub-varieties, Early 
ripening, with field beans, is important, when other crops are to succeed 
the same season. They are usually planted in hills about two feet apart, 
and also in drills covered two inches with fine earth. They have been 
sown broadcast, on clean, dry soils, and produced largely. When planted 
in hills, from four to six plants should be left in each, according to their 
proximity, or if in drills they need about one and a-half bushels of seed to 
the acre. 

When the beans are fully formed and there is any danger of frost, they 
should be at once secured, but this scarcely affects them when they are 
gathered and thrown into heaps. If the ground is not wanted for other 
uses, they may stand until the latest pods assumes a yellow colour. They 
are pulled with ease when the plant is mature, as the fibres of the roots 
are by that time dead. This is more quickly accomplished with an iron 
hook rake, or if the stocks are partially green they can be mown. The 
vines, if not dry, should remain for a while in small heaps, and afterwards 
collected in larger piles around stakes set at convenient distances, with 
the roots in the centre and secured at the top by a wisp of straw ; and 
when well dried they should be threshed, cleaned and spread till quite free 
from dampness. 

PEASK. This legumen succeeds best in moderately light and friable 
soils of a loamy and calcareous kind, or where lime or chalk has been re- 
cently applied, in British experience. In Canada, a clay loam is well 
adapted to their cultivation, though a calcareous or wheat soil may be 
said to be a pea soil. When sown on a thin sod, the manure should be 
spread before ploughing. They should have a clean fallow, or fresh, rich 
sod. They are not affected by frosts, and can be sown as soon as the 
ground is dry, thus enabling to follow with fall wheat. Peas are some- 
times sown in drill, but most usually broadcast, at the rate of two bushels 
to the acre. 



538 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

HARVESTING is accomplished by cutting with the scythe or the new 
implement called the Pea Harvester, which is attached to an ordinary 
mower, or, when fully ripe, so that the roots pull out easily, with the 
horse rake. When thus gathered into heaps and well dried, they may be 
threshed out and the haulm carefully stacked and saved. 

THE POTATO. The soils best adapted for potatoes are friable, sandy, 
and loamy. On such soils potatoes are often grown systematically and 
extensively as a staple crop in the rotation ; but on strong tenacious clays 
with a retentive subsoil they do not thrive. Potatoes, however, have a 
wonderful adaptation to soils of various textures and composition. They 
do well on virgin soils and turfy land ; and though subject to be cut 
down by early frost, and again to suffer in the tops by autumn frosts, po- 
tatoes are grown under a great range of temperature. 

To produce abundantly, potatoes require a fertile soil, and if not already 
sufficiently rich, manure should be spread on the surface before ploughing. 
If a tough sod, it should be ploughed the preceding fall, or if friable it 
may be done just before planting; but in all cases the land should be put 
in such condition as to be perfectly loose and mellow. Hills are the most 
convenient for tillage, as they admit of more thorough stirring of the 
ground with the cultivator or plough. Medium size, split potatoes have 
been ascertained from numerous experiments to be the best for planting, 
and when seed is scarce, it is sometimes economical to quarter them. Six 
or seven eyes should be placed in each hill, or if in drills, the pieces should 
be planted ten inches apart. The distance both of hills and drills must 
depend on the strength of the soil and the size of the tops, some varieties 
growing much larger than others. Cover with light mould to the depth 
of four inches, and if the soil be light, leave the ground perfectly level ; if 
cold, heavy or moist, let the hill or drill be raised when finished. Subsoil 
ploughing is a great help to potatoes. The sets cut from the seed end 
give a much earlier crop than those from the root. 

When the plants first appear above ground, run the plough through 
them, and throw the earth over them two or three inches, and no injury 
results if the tops are partially or even entirely covered, in flat cultivation. 
The ground should be several times stirred before the tops interfere with 
the operation, but never after they come into blossom. If in drill, use a 
light harrow just as the plants appear, and afterwards horse hoe when 
required. 

HARVESTING AND STORING should not be commenced until the tops are 
mostly dead, as the tuber has not arrived at full maturity before this 
time. They may then be thrown out of the hills or drill by a plough.,

horse potato digger, or some hand implement. They ought not to be ex- 
posed to the sun for any length of time, but may dry on the surface in a 
cloudy day, or be gathered into small heaps with some of the tops spread 
over them, until freed from the surface moisture, when they may be 
stored Those selected for seed should be placed in small piles in the 
field, or in thin layers in a cool, dry place in the cellar where the air is 
excluded, and no heating or injury can occur. Such as are intended for 
consumption may be put in dry bins or barrels in the store-room, covered 
with straw and dry sand or loose earth to prevent the circulation of air. 
or buried in the field. 

ROOTS. Any man who is thoroughly acquainted with the best systems 
of growing root crops, and can put his knowledge into effective practice, 
is certain, under ordinary circumstances, to prove a good and successful 
farmer. The supply of manure, and, consequently, the continued fertility 
of the soil depend, to a very large extent, both on the skilful culture of 
roots, and on their economical consumption. The first thing calculated 
to secure the success of root culture is deep and effective working of the 
soil. 

Deep ploughing in autumn or early winter, when the soil is tolerably 
dry, and effective spring working, calculated not only to give a deep 
stratum of fine earth on the surface, but to preserve the sap required to 
germinate the seeds readily, are essential parts of skilful root cultivation. 
It will be found of much advantage in many cases, to apply the farm- 
yard manure required for the crop, in the autumn season, rather than in 
spring. By spring-time it will be well rotted, and can then be properly 
mixed with the soil, in addition to having acted to mechanical advantage 
on the soil. 

When the ground has been reduced to a sufficiently fine tilth in spring, 
and the weeds carefully checked, the next step is the preparation of the 
seed-bed. Sowing on the flat is common ; and, in some of the dry 
counties where the soil is light, the system has its advantages. But, 
if the land is to be cleaned for a succeeding grain crop, or if a very heavy 
yield of roots is wished, there is no mode of management equal to that 
of sowing the seed in slightly raised drills, varying from twenty-seven 
to thirty inches in width. 

The successful growing of root crops depends, to a large extent, on the 
skilful and liberal use of proper manures. The farmer dare not apply 
liberal dressings of forcing fertilisers to his cereal crops ; for in the over- 
luxuriance of the straw, he is certain to diminish rather than increase 
their market value. With root crops, particularly turnips, the case is 



540 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

altogether different. A turnip or mangel bulb is cellular in its formation, 
and, under good management, there can scarcely be any limit to its 
development. It may be said, that very large roots are in an abnormal 
state, and that, in producing them, we are running in the face of natural 
laws. If this is the principal objection to root culture, then we must either 
disregard it, or allow the plant to return, by a gradual course of degener- 
acy, to its original type, in which it will be altogether useless to the 
farmer. But the objection does not apply, practically, to either the turnip 
or any other kind of crop grown by the farmer. All cultivated plants are 
in an unnatural state, in one respect ; and sometimes the cultivator who 
throws nature into the shade, is the most successful in his art. 

Apart, however from keeping the land in an open and well cleaned 
state by repeated horse-hoeings between the rows in dry summer weather, 
the facilities afforded by the drill system for baring the bulbs a little of 
the soil around them are not to be overlooked. Every successful grower 
of the turnip knows, that while the roots which are deeply set in the soil 
are generally the most palatable, they are far from being the bulkiest or 
the most valuable in the aggregate. It is often of very great importance 
that the seed should be kept near to the manure, and yet not so near to any 
Jarge quantity of it as to have its vitality destroyed. If the rootlets of 
the young plants can catch the manure just as soon as they appear, the 
crop comes away at once, and defies insect pests ; but if they are some 
time before they find it, a very considerable loss may be entailed on the 
farmer. Very deep drills are, in all cases, objectionable ; but particularly 
so, when only special fertilisers are to be employed. The better the latter 
can be mixed with the wrought soil, provided it is kept two inches or so, 
below the surface, the more satisfactory will the results be. In many 
cases, the chemical ingredients we apply to the soil require to be mixed 
with it, and changed completely in their nature before they can nourish 
plant life in a satisfactory manner. Hence, if phosphates, or other 
auxiliary manures are placed in the bottoms of shallow drills, that is 
without being sown broadcast the turnip plants, in sending down their 
roots, are likely either to be checked in growth, or to rush into an un- 
healthy luxuriance. To this evil that of gross manuring perhaps 
more than any other connected with manures, may be ascribed the 
prevalence of* finger-and-toe in the more highly farmed districts. If the 
soil is very light, and contains, as it is sure to do in that case, a compara- 
tively small quantity of the alkaline silicates, it may not effectually cure 
the evil to mix the manures with it ; but on loamy or strong soils, there 
is no fear of this being the case. Though the plants are very near to the

541 



chemical substances applied as manures, yet if the latter are well mixed 
with the pulverised agillaceous earth, they will have no tendency to 
produce anything like grossness of structure. 

The success of root culture is also, in a great measure dependent on 
judicious summer management. A delay, in moist growing weather of a 
week, or two, or even of a few days, in thinning the turnip crop, will 
frequently reduce the yield by several tons per acre. Or, if the thinning- 
work is improperly executed, the result may be no better. It is an old 
saying that a farmer should never have the oversight of the workers who 
are thinning his own turnips. In all probability he will think that the 
crop is being spoiled by severe thinning, while the very reverse is the 
case. A considerable amount of skill is required to manage the turnip 
crop in a proper manner ; and, without good management, the heaviest 
yield of the bulbs need not be expected. 

Much of the success of root culture, in the best farmed districts depends 
on the careful storing of the crop, and judicious consumption of it by 
stock, in conjunction with grain. In this way, it will be observed, that 
the subject of root cultivation can never be treated altogether by itself 
for it bears directly, and in a most important manner, on the economy of 
stock-feeding and manure making. Indeed, were it dissociated from the 
other branches of farm management, the whole practice of agriculture 
would require to be established on a totally new basis. 

I trust the time is not far distant, when by good management in 
growing our feeding root crops, they may be increased in weight over the 
present standard at least from one -third to one-half. With such an 
increase, there would be an immense addition to the home-made manures 
of the farm ; the soil would attain a higher state of fertility ; the farmer's 
profits would be better ; and the gross agricultural returns of the country 
would be greatly enhanced. 

TURNIPS, The soils best adapted for the cultivation of turnips are un- 
questionably those of a free working loamy character a fertile well- 
drained loam. But it is on new land or freshly turned sod, that they are 
most successful. Anuntilled virgin earth, with the rich dressing of ashes 
left after the recent burning of accumulated vegetable matter, and free 
from weeds and insects, is the surest [and most productive for a tur- 
nip crop. Such land needs no manure. 

Taking the case of the lighter soils under ridge cultivation, and supposing 
the land to have been manured with fifteen loads of manure and ploughed 
under in autumn, ploughed in early spring, and since stirred by the use of 
the cultivator or grubber, preparation has now to be made for the seed time,

which is from loth of June to loth July in this country. The field hav- 
ing been thoroughly mellowed by grubbing, harrowing, and rolling more 
than twice if necessary, the surface is finally left smooth from the roller.

salt, previously mixed. Drill immediately at 27 or 28 inches, and keep 
the seeding close to the drilling all the time. Four pounds of seed per acre 
is better than two, under almost any circumstances, never grudge the 
seed, because much allowance has to be made for poor germination, 
drought, and insect enemies, and besides close neighbourhood gives 
an earlier start if a more tender plant, which early thining helps to remedy. 
Horse-hoe early twice if necessary before thinning, and thin before much 
bunching takes place. Nine inches from plant to plant is a good average 
In this operation the hand hoe removes all weeds left by the other. Allow 
the plants to rise from their generally recumbent position ere allowing 
any more cultivation, but as in moist weather much of the dirt is left a foot 
between drills, send the horse-hoe over again soon. A second hand-hoeing 
to remove " doubles," and new weeds in drills, with a final horse-hoeing 
before leaves meet, should complete Swede turnip cultivation. 

Leave the crop as late into autumn as possible with the view to secur- 
ing all the weight per acre bulbs swell best during cool evenings and 
warm days. Ten degrees of frost will do no harm. In harvesting, top 
with a sharp hoe, pull up in dry weather with the hand, or a heavy wooden 
harrow having few teeth, and haul to pit or cellar at once. Some prefer

liability to heat and rot is overborne by the extra health of stock. Pit- 
ting in the field is better, when properly done, than a poor cellar. 

MANGEL WURZEL. 

The mangel crop is grown, to a greater or less extent, on every variety 
of soil ; but those best adapted to its successful cultivation are deep ad- 
hesive loams. Hot and dry summers are favourable to its success as a 
field crop. On all adhesive soils autumn cultivation is of the utmost im- 
portance. 

During the early autumn, and whilst the land is still dry, a heavy dress- 
ing of farmyard manure should be applied, and ploughed under deep, 'ihe 
spring preparation for seeding is similar to that for turnips, and the 
special manures cannot be less, and should give at least 400 Ibs. salt per 



THE CULTIVATION OF FARM CROPS. 5 43 

acre. Where practicable the ridge system of cultivation, in which the 
seed is planted along the top of a raised drill from 28 to 30 inches wide, is 
preferable, chiefly on account of the facilities afforded for deep and repei*t- 
ed stirrings of the soil. 

The crop should be sown during the first week in May. Much in this 
respect depends on the season, soil and climate. In England as much as 
T2 tons of well-made farmyard manure applied during the autumn or win- 
ter ; and a mixture consisting of 500 Ibs. of mineral superphosphate, 100 
of kainite, 100 of sulphate of ammonia, and 300 of common salt per acre, 
is usually sown broadcast at seedtime and covered in by a turn of the chain 
harrow. If sown on the flat, the seed is deposited by the ordinary grain 
drill, to which a suitable seed box is attached. If on the ridge a drill 
specially constructed is employed. The seed being enveloped in a hard 
woody case or capsule, requires to be well saturated with moisture before 
the germ can escape ; and in order to facilitate germination the 
seeds are frequently steeped in water for a period of forty-eight hours be- 
fore being committed to the soil. When removed from the water they are 
spread thinly on a floor in order to drain off the superfluous moisture. We 
then frequently use a sufficient quantity of finely-powdered charcoal to 
mix with it, and form a thin coating to each seed. When prepared in 
this way the seed vegetates much more quickly than when it is sown in 
an unprepared state. Six or seven Ibs. is the usual quantity of seed em- 
ployed per acre. 

There are several well-known varieties in cultivation. On deep strong 
loams the Long Reds succeed well, and produce a great weight per acre ; 
but if overtaken by early frosts they suffer severely, as they stand high 
above the ground. The Red Globe is less productive, and better adapted 
for light soils ; the Orange and Yellow Globe are probably the most suit- 
able for every variety of soils. They are hardy and heavy croppers, and 
for quality they cannot be surpassed. 

Immediately the young plants, if on the ridge, have come into full leaf, 
and as soon as the weather is favourable, the horse-hoe should at once be 
set to work, at first only stirring the surface soil, but going deeper at each 
repeated operation. If on the flat, the hand-hoe should be early at work 
to keep the weed growth in check. The plants generally succeed best when 
singled or thinned whilst small : the best distance from plant to plant is 
12 to 16 inches. When the plants have made considerable progress in 
growth it is frequently found that a dressing of 100 of nitrate of soda and 
200 of common salt produced profitable results. The horse-hoe should 
be kept at work as long as the spread of the leaves will admit. The man-

gel crop may be grown successfully from transplanted plants, showery 
weather being chosen for the operation. Care should be taken not to double 
up the tap root when planting it, nor to dibble the young plant in too 
deeply. 

Under ordinary circumstances the crop will be ready to harvest by the 
first of October. The work should be done in dry weather ; the roots are 
pulled up by the hand, and the tops may be either twisted off by the hand 
or removed by a knife. In doing this great care should be taken not to 
wound the crown of the root. During fine weather the roots are benefited 
by lying exposed several days before being stored. The chief danger is 
frost. Denuded of the protecting covering of their leaves, they are greatly 
injured if exposed to a sharp frost, even for a single night. None of the 
rootlets should be removed from the bulbs until they are required for use. 
On sound land they may be stored in small heaps in the field ; on strong 
land they are generally hauled oft' whilst the land is dry, and stored in 
cellars. 

CARROTS. These can be grown successfully only on deep, well-drained 
sandy loams. Deep cultivation is an essential point. The land should 
have a dressing of 12 to 16 tons of well-rotted farmyard manure ap- 
plied in the autumn. The soil should be deeply and thoroughly stir- 
red, the manure spread and covered in with a shallow furrow, and left in 
such a state as to require little labour at spring. The seed should be 
sown not later than the first week in May ; the necessary quantity of 
seed is 3 Ibs. per acre. They are sown on the fiat and ridge, in rows 16 
to 20 inches apart. We (O. E. Farm) use from 400 to 500 of a similar 
mixture of artificial manures to that applied to the turnip and mangel 
crop. The hairy covering of the seeds causes them to adhere, hence the 
practical utility of mixing with dry sand before sowing. This operation 
is performed by mixing a quantity of clean sand and seed together, rub- 
bing the mixture well between the hands; it is then moistened witli 
water and spread out on a floor, where it is turned over daily and watered 
when necessary. It may remain in this state for a week or ten days, or 
until it is on the point of germinating, when it should at once be sown. 
The chief object is to enable the young plants to get the start of the weeds, 
which, under ordinary circumstances, often smother the tender plants. 

It is essential that the soil be deep and thoroughly pulverised. The 
slightest obstruction causes the plant to throw out lateral shoots or forks, 
which greatly detract from the quality of the crop. The plants when 
thinned should be set out from 4 to 8 inches in the rows, according to the

sort that is being cultivated. Horse and hand-hoeing should be vigorous! v 
carried on as long as practicable. 

The crop should be ready for lifting by the middle of October. If the 
weather is tine and free from frost, the roots are the better for remaining 
a few days in the field before being hauled off. They are stored in heaps 
and if sand can be readily obtained, it is a good plan to mix a quantity 
with the roots. 

HOPS. Hops require a rich, and highly manured loam, elaborate culti- 
vation, a sheltered position, and a suitable climate in order to succ 
The crop, worth sometimes more than the price of the land annually, pro- 
vides in successful years such an addition to the revenue of any farm 
suitable for its cultivation that it is very apt to absorb to itself an undue 
share of the means at the command of the farmer ; and the general agri- 
culture of a district where this crop prevails is apt to suffer in this way. 
A sheltered field, of naturally suitable soil deep, fertile, and well drained 
should be selected. It is deeply ploughed, subsoiled, and manured in 
autumn. Cuttings, or shoots of any approved sort, which have been speci- 
ally reared, are then planted in rows 6 feet apart, 4 being planted in every 
" hill," 6 feet apart in the rows. Some growers plant two or three hills 
with male plants in order to ensure the proper fertilization of the seed. 
This planting should be done early in spring. The wide interspaces are 
sometimes turned to account during the first year in the growth of pota- 
toes or cabbages. Each hill has a short pole placed near it which is fixed 
before summer and to which the young vine is tied. There is rarely any 
produce the first year. The spaces are well cultivated both ways, and 
heavily manured the richest farm dung and every available fertilizer 
being employed in quantities unknown in the case of any other crop. The 
ground is cultivated and manured in early spring, the hills severallv 
tended with spud and hoe, useless suckers cut away, and the hills re-poled, 
this time with three longer poles to a hill. The intervals continue to be 
cultivated with a special horse-hoe ; the bine is tied to the poles per- 
haps three bines to each. The hills are properly earthed up with shovels- 
full of earth in the end of May. There may be some trimming and prun- 
ing required in case of strong growth in June. And the hops are hand- 
picked as soon as fit, i. e., at a stage of ripeness which is recognisable only 
by experience. They are carried to the kiln, dried, packed and sold. The 
poles are then stripped and stacked on the ground or. under cover, and 
they are looked over, and replenished before spring comes round, when 
they are again required.

SOKGHUM SUGAR CANE. Like Indian corn, the sorghum is, in it* 
roots, deep and wide spreading, and like that, requires a thoroughly 
drained, warm, free, and good soil to promote its sweet flavour wet and 
cold soils contributing but slightly, or in a much less degree, to its devel- 
opment. It should be planted, too, at about the same season as corn, and 
receive frequent and clean cultivation. Heavy, unctuous barn-yard ma- 
nure should not be applied to the crop, giving it too rank a growth. 
Well rotted, or compost manures are better, or it may be grown on soils 
succeeding a crop to which such manures have been previously and lately 
applied. Lime, ashes, salt, guano, and the phosphates generally, are ex- 
cellent manures, giving a medium growth to the stalk, and promoting the 
development of the sacharine juice in a higher degree than the more 
stimulating humus of the heavier fertilizers. It is, in fact, a cultivation 
by itself, but no more intricate, or difficult, than that of Indian corn, the 
proper land being once selected ; and as a general rule, good corn land will 
produce good sorghum. 

Harvesting should be done before the first sharp autumnal frosts. The 
sorgho ripens unequally, or unevenly rather, some stalks being fit to cut a 
few days before others ; but as it should not be left to fully ripen before 
cutting, this inequality in maturity, when favourably grown, is of no par- 
ticular injury. It should be cut near the ground; the two top joints cut 
off and thrown aside, being too weak and crude in their sap to add to the 
quality of the cane below. 

As soon after cutting as possible, it should be removed to the crushing, 
or grinding mill, and put under cover from storms, or the drying heat of 
thesun,and its juices be not tainted by mould, or too much dried by con- 
densation, to be easily expressed. As soon after cutting as possible, the 
canes should go into the mill for crushing. 

The grinding, evaporation, and its manufacture into syrup is a process 
by itself, distinct from its cultivation. 

FLAX. Flax requires rich fertile land in good tilth, and in clean con- 
dition. It is generally taken after a grain crop. The stubble should be 
well cleaned and manured before winter, and grubbed, harrowed and 
rolled in the following spring, and from six to eight pecks of seed are sown 
in the end of April, either in rows eight to ten inches apart, or broadcast ; 
and covered in by light seed harrows. It is of the utmost importance 
that good clean seed be used. The crop is hand-weeded in May. It gets 
into bloom in June, and may be pulled any time thereafter. If the finest 
fibre is desired, it should be pulled before the bolls or seed vessels ripen. 
But these are generally allowed to get brown and ripe before the crop is

harvested. It is pulled in handfuls, left to dry, tied in bundles, and 
either at once submitted to rippling for the separation of the seed, or 

stacked for after-treatment. After being separated from the seed which 

is effected by pulling the heads, a handful of stems at a time, through the 
steel teeth of a comb, placed upright against a horizontal board, on either 
end of which an operator sits the straw is rotted, either by crolono'ed 
exposure to the weather on the surface of any grass field, or, in a more 
rapid way by soaking ; and that is either done in a stream or pond, or in 
tepid water in a vat, the mass of sheaves in the water bein weighted so 
as to keep the top just below the surface. In this way the woody part of 
the stem rots. It is then dried, rolled to break up the dried stems, and 
scutched for the removal of the rotten " wood" and the seperation of 
the fibre.

In order to have a full idea of the position of these either in " soiling " 
or as helps in mixed farming, the following paper by myself may serve 
all purposrs : 

We are accustomed to hear of the different systems of farming called 
grazing, grain-growing, root farming, dairy farming, and mixed farming 
in each and all of which the live stock go and come from field to field in 
summer, according to conditions of cultivation and the various modes of 



management. 



In these examples the animals search for food, and must be satis- 
fied with what they find within a limited area, thus differing from 
those in the' wild state, only in having a more choice bite for a certain 
time, but with less variety and fewer successions of crops, for nature, after 
all our combination of science and practice, gives a more regular rotation 
of grasses and other herbage than the best uf our model farming now-a- 
days. 

Were we therefore to think of the summer management of cattle on 
the patriarchal plan of moving from place to place, or having the range of a 
common bush, we possibly could not improve upon them in the desire for 
more palatable milk and good beef, in moderate ijuantity, at the least posi- 
ble cost. But comparatively new country though we be, our bounds are 
becoming keenly outlined, and every foot of land clearly defined. The 
day is not far-off in Ontario at least when every fence will have its 
own place economically, when every open ditch will be grudged, every

wide, private lane tightened up, every cairn of stones and swamp corner 
be greedily reclaimed, and every tree have its proper place on our farms- 

As an agent towards such an end, the comparatively new and little un- 
derstood system of cattle management called "Soiling" will have much 
to say ere long. 

To show this in the most practical shape is my present duty. I desire 
distinctly to confine myself to the produce of certain crops used for this 
purpose as against the prevailing summer management of cattle, we call 
<( Grazing.'" It would be easy to bring in the important story of the use 
of auxiliaries in both cases, but to do so would complicate and take from 
the value of the comparison. Soiling, then, is the housing of cattle at all 
Seasons, and distinctively, in our circumstances, from the middle of April 
to the middle of October, when all their food is taken to them from the 
fields in place of their being allowed to search for themselves. 

First, what is our position in Ontario as cattle graziers ? We have not 
yet secured the rich old pastures of England, rich as our soils are, because 
we cannot secure variety enough of grasses (which means fifteen to twenty 
kinds) to give a close bottom and offer that succession of herbage best for 
the health and growth of animal life. Our droughts, and especially our 
winters, are against this ; we have rain enough per annum, but it is not 
distributed sufficiently to give the regular top-dressing so essential to con- 
tinuous greenness. Here permit the remark that as we have ourselves 
been the cause of this irregularity of rainfall, and temperature to a certain 
extent, so it is left to us to make good the balancing of the things in na- 
ture that have been displaced how and where the meteorologist and 
arborculturist will explain by and by, for so sure as we are opening our- 
selves to the world's public markets so sure are we bound to leave no 
stone unturned in view of national eminence among them. 

On an average of seasons, on putting a cattle beast to the field, without 
any grain or cut fodder helps, there is no going back, neither is there 
much progress in flesh making ; there is growth of bone and muscle, but 
comparatively little finishing on the outside or inside. So then we can 
make the frame in the field but not complete it for the home or foreign 
market. In this respect, therefore, we cannot possibly compete at pre- 
sent with some other parts of the world. What applies to beef making 
applies to the making of milk. 

With unreliable pastures for continuous progress in beef or milk pro- 
ductions, the question before us is how can we better ourselves ? 
have the soil, or soils, we have the indispensable sunshine, as also the ir- 
regular showers, and all the essentials towards the upkeep of fertility. 






THE CULTIVATION OF FORAGE. 549 

Have we the enterprise, or shall I call it the necessary common sense ? 
Indeed, history, past and present, shows that with such a sunshine as ours, 
some nations would be in possession of an enormous agricultural wealth, 
by the simple economy of that sunshine in the production of repeated 
crops of fodder plants in one season, even from a bed of sand. 

We want then to secure such a succession, or association of green fod- 
ders during six months of the year as shall secure the following objects : 

1. An early cut. 

2. Repeated cuttings of the same plant. 

3. A sufficient number to offer an unbroken supply of succulent 
herbage. 

4. Kinds to differ considerably in their constituent elements. 

5. The largest possible produce per acre consistent with good husbandry 
(and this implies much). 

6. High fattening and milking properties. 

I have no desire to lengthen introductory remarks, and shall now sub- 
mit for consideration, first a diagram, showing what crops, in our present 
knowledge of things, can be cultivated in view of these objects. In this 
we have the experience of different parts of Canada, and particularly that 
of The Ontario Experimental Farm. 

As is well known, all animal life must have a change of food in order 
to secure health and the best production of flesh and milk, and so we 
are called upon to examine the nourishing values of these various plants 
as got month by month. 

Rich old pasture, with its many varieties of grasses, is not only one of 
the most valuable fodders, green or dry, as is well known for milk-making, 
but it also takes a high place as an actual fattener for animals ; for these 
reasons it is used as a standard for comparing other green fodders with 
and accordingly we shall adopt it on this occasion. 

If then good pasture, with its full TOO per cent, of nourishing proper- 
ties, is a standard of nature's making as improved by man for all the 
essentials of animal life, it must be important to see how far our ten 
kinds of special green fodders come up to this standard from month to 
month. 

Lucerne leads with '38 ; millet, second, with '36 ; red clover having '31 
sainfoin, fourth, with -28 per cent. 

Three of these in April make a large start, therefore with an average of 
32 per cent., and it will be observed that all the early croppers are very 

much superior in their feeding values than those that come after June 

millet excepted. There is then a range of no less _than "18 from -20 in 



530 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

the case of corn, up to '38 in that of lucerne and the fact of this differ- 
ence in feeding value implies corresponding difference in the actual 
elements of the plants, so that we certainly have variety enough. I shall 
not labour my paper with any detailed chemical analysis, as I trust it is 
clear that along with the variety of plants, we have also a variety of 
elements for all healthy and rapid production of flesh and milk the 
man of sience says so, and practical experience says so. Of course the 
mean of '29 per cent, over the season is much below the standard of TOO, 
and this again points to the help wasted by some form of grain should 
higher excellence be desirable, although many good managements consider 
it really necessary to give grain for milk where green fodders are plentiful 
and various. 

We have now, therefore, established two important things : 
1st. That Canada can grow the necessary variety and quantity of 
green fodders. 

2nd. That they are well adapted to the sustenance of animal life for 

the purposes in view. 

The next question is what is the proper position of "soiling m 
association with grain, root and hay cultivation, and what can be done on 
a farm, say of 100 acres ? 

There can be no idea of recommending soiling alone as a separate 
system of farming in this or any other country, the essentials of life 
cannot be neglected, nor can the average farmer run the risk of reducing 
his income by placing all his faith in one or two articles of production 
only. 

There must be provision for horses in hay and grain ; pasture for sheep 
and yearling cattle ; and roots, straw and grain for cattle, sheep and pigs 
in winter ; and grain and potatoes for family use. By grain I mean 
wheat, oats, barley, and peas, and roots include mangolds, turnips and 
carrots. We have to deal with the following classes of crops in 
rotation : 

1 Roots. 

2 Grain. 

3 Hay. 

4 Pasture. 

5 Green Fodder. 

The srreen fodders are divisible into 

O 

1 Cereals, one-half. 



THE CULTIVATION OF FORAGE 551 

2 Clovers one-fourth. 

3 Foliage proper one-fourth. 

On soil of an average texture, the best rotation in mv opinion is ; 

1 Peas and grain fodders. 

2 Wheat and oats. 

3 Roots and foliage fodders. 

4 Barley or wheat (seeded) and clover fodders.

obtain their comparative values the figures on the horizonta

To recapitulate, by the plants sought for, we have, as regards 
an early cut, lucerne coming about the middle of April, followet 
by sainfoin a week later, and red clover at the end of that month 
thus obtaining three tons per acre from three varieties during a 
time when moisture is plentiful and the temperature rarely below 
freezing point, the average bein gabout 60 and the maximum 70.

dry fodders, roots and grain.

In this diagram we have an exhibition of twelve varieties of 
plants from the middle of April to the end of October, in the 
order of earliness. Each horizontal bar represents one acre, and 
the time during which each plant can be cut and used on an 
average of seasons. The date of sowing is shown by a cross, and 
the number of times the same plant can be cut in one season is 
given in the first culumn after October. Following the latter 
information is the quantity of green fodder obtained per acre from 
any of the kinds all over the season, and adjoining, the weight of 
these in the dry or hay condition. The last column contains the 
value per acre of each kind, that value being regulated by the 
following circumstances : 
Good hay from rich pasture is valued at an average of $10 per 
ton, and the feeding ratio or nourishing properties thereof stands 
at 100 ; taking these as standards and they are now recognized 
as such we would have this calculation, as regards, for example, 
lucerne : 
If hay equals $10 per ton and a feeding value of 100, what is

two cuttings ; two also by two sowings of rape, two from two sowings of millet, and 
one each from corn and cabbage, so that in all we hive no fewer than 21 cuttings from 
ten varieties of fodder plants. 

As many kinds therefore as should offer an unbroken supply of succulent herbage 
during the whole summer months, for without tenderness, freshness and regular supply 
we are not in a positio^i to impress the value of this system upon the average farmer 
or dairyman. 

On examining the diagram, there is no time of the six months during which there 
are less than three sorts on hand, and in some months as many as eight ; and indeed 
in place of any want, the difficulty during July and August is to keep up with the suc- 
cession of offerings before they become woody or matured. 

It would not be difficult to add a few other fodders of less importance to this list, 
and especially to note the fact that on well-arranged farms, where root cultivation is a 
prominent feature, mangolds are generally in such quantity, and have come through 
the winter so fresh and good, that they are not finished until June thus, then, a very 
valuable help to, it may be, the scant early green fodders. 

I cannot recommend the practice a very old one, now less necessary of thinning 
and feeding the leaves of turnips and mangolds, during their growth, but the system- 
atic and careful use of both bulb and leaves of those removed to make room for the 
permanent crop is another thing, and a very important auxiliary to what we are 
treating upon. 

Of the various green fodder crops there would be : 

Lucerne 3 acres producing yearly 48 tons. 

Sainfoin, 1 " 6 " 

Red Clover 3 " 21 " 

Rye 2 " " 12 " 

Tares and Oats 2 " " 12 "

Rape 2 " " " 30 " 

Cora 4 " 80 " 

Cabbage and Kale, 1 ' 12 " 



20 acres giving 234 tons. 

per annum. 

The system altogether then is practically one of five divisions, having- 
equal parts of twenty acres under roots, grain, hay, pasture, and green 
fodders. 

Taking a clay loam as the average texture of Canadian soils, it is 
obvious that a rotation of cropping agreeable to all sound theory and 
practice, and by which no exhaustion could possibly take place even 
under careless management, would be what is called the seven course, as- 



554 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

laid down in these notes. By this our green fodders would accompany 
the first, second and fourth divisions after sod breaking, so as to agree, and 
not interfere with S3'stematic rotation and management over the whole 
farm. 

The sod for one or two years' pasture is broken un. and cropped with 
peas and grain fodders, these grain fodders being corn, tares and oats 
millet and rye ; the second year is wheat and oats in proportion of five 
and ten respectively ; the third in roots with foliage fodders in the shape 
of rape, cabbage and kale, and prickley comfrey all the latter as with 
roots proper, admitting of thorough cultivation, manuring, and cleaning, 
upon which rests the backbone of this system. During the fourth year 
grass seeds (of timothy and clover) are laid down with barley or wheat, 
and part, if deemed necessary, with red clover alone as the green fodder 
section of this division, and of course the fifth and sixth years are hay, 
with the exception of, say, one-half of the sixth as pasture ; seventh year 
pasture. 

In all this there is an easy and luxurious cropping, suitable to the 
best of mixed farming and according, with the " soiling " system under 
consideration. There is no excess of grain and hay, but thorough cleaning 
and strengthening of soils by root management, with sufficient rest (so 
called) by depasturing with sheep and young cattle. 

The twenty acres devoted to green fodders, will on an average, give, 
under the best management, 234 tons per annum. 

WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS AMOUNT ON GREEN FODDERS. 

Allowing for waste, one cattle beast of average size, age and circum- 
stances as regards fattening, breeding, or milking, will consume daily 100 
Ibs. of these green materials, along with such dry fodders and grain as 
may be considered desirable more or less, of course, according to objects. 
For the six months named this means the maintenance of twenty-six head, 
or nearly one and one-third (1J) animal per acre. Now it is well 
known in Canadian experience that it takes fully three acres of ordinary 
pasture not poor pasture remember, but well laid down timothy and 
clover, to keep one of such cattle in full progressive condition either 
laying on fat decently well, or milking well over the average, no stinting 
or having the animals walking two miles a day over and over a twenty 
acre field in search of a bellyful. 

We have then the striking difference of four (4) to one (1) meantime, 
in favour of " soiling," or against grazing, without allowing for any other 



THE CULTIVATION OF FORAGE. 555 

facts for or against. Were one-tenth of dry fodders such as hay or 
s t raw added to the green ones, six more animals can be maintained, but 
our present purpose is to follow the exact value of the soiling crops alone. 

It is rare in these times to find more than fifteen head of cattle in 
all on a hnndred acre farm, summer and winter. So, supposing that 
one-half of the soiled animals, in our example case, were for the butcher 
and the other half supporters of the dairy, there would be an additional 
live head of yearlings and five calves, with one bull and one score of 
sheep. The sheep and yearlings would be grazed, but the calves and bull 
housed and receiving part green fodders ; these would be equal to four (4) 
additional average sized cattle, and so reducing the 26 to 22 head that 
can be maintained from twenty acres of soiling materials. Still additional 
to this would be what would or should be used for horses or pigs, so that 
altogether we arrive at the safe standard of 20 cattle, or one to each acre. 

Soiling in Canada then is as three to one, and by the system which I 
have thus sketched it is plain that by simply setting aside 20 acres from 
the 100, so as not to interfere with the reliable and profitable farming 
called mixed, or alternate, we can fatten, or dairy, 20 cattle in place of 7 
during the six months of spring, summer and autumn. 

What now is the financial position in the system ? 

To this, sketch first the general management that would be adopted : 
Upon a hundred acre farm such as I have introduced, one man with 
horse and cart can easily undertake the attendance in every respect of 
these 10 fattening cattle, 10 cows, 5 yearlings, 5 calves, 1 bull and 20 
sheep. Any of the yearlings intended for breeding would be grazed dur- 
ing their second summer, but those for fattening should be systematically 
housed, getting one hour's exercise daily ; the calves would also be under 
cover, the sheep on pasture of course. At the most then, the cattle 
man would have 30 head to be soiled. After feeding and cleaning 
up in the morning he has to cut and cart home 2,500 Ibs. of green fodder, 
in two loads, for the evening use, and as all green f odders are better to be 
slightly " wilted," not heated, ere offered, he would thus have to secure 
another cut in the evening to be used for next morning meals.

In the case of " soiling " a clear profit of $175 and that of grazing $53

I am handling a strict debit and credit account, and not speaking of so 
much flesh or milk revenue per acre, without charging what very few 
farmers do charge in estimating profits. All this, remember, without any 
help from bush or stubble pasture, and any roadside pickings no meal, 
bran or slops of any sort, but the plain produce of the soil in each case. 

Again, then, let us note that "soiling" in Canada means fully three 
times the profits of grazing, in addition to other considerations now to be 
examined. 



THE CULTIVATION OF FORAGE. 



SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SOILING. 



557 



]. Where land is a consideration there is a great saving of it by bein^ 
enabled to maintain at least one cattle beast per acre in place of having 
to calculate on allowing three acres to graze one. 

1. Where we reckon by the amount of fodder produce (soiling, or 
pasturing,) there is a large saving of food in avoiding'destruction by cattle 
traffic. 

3. Where we have apparently useless quantities of any kind of straw, 
chaff, and hay good or poor in quality they can be safely used in as- 
sociation with the moist green fodders. 

4. We obtain fully double the quantity, and proportionately much 
more value of manure by soiling than by allowing it to have its own way 
in the field, the roadside, and the court. I am of opinion that were we 
able correctly to estimate the value of farm yard manure in connection 
with this matter of soiling of cattle there would be no concern on the part 
of the farmer as to any other form of profit. He would simply be so in- 
dependent as to be able to throw all beef or milk into the bargain, or 
allow them to stand as the mere overflowings of a system that puts him 
in possession of all the past and future wealth of his fields. Would the 
day were here when we all knew how to make, how to preserve, and how 
to apply our cattle droppings. 

5. The larger produce of flesh and milk on an average. 

G. Gives greater variety of materials, allows uniformity in manage- 
ment, which gives greater comfort and health, and less liability of ac- 
cidents. 

7. But it requires greater care and intelligence to establish and main- 
tain such a variety of crops ; so, if this is to be put up as an objection to 
the system, we had better say beat at once. When any farmer begins to 
speak about "troubles," and first expense, and too much looking after of 
things, then the sooner he falls into the ditch the better; let him continue 
his successive crops of wheat, and give his cattle the range of all the farm, 
so as the earlier to convince him of the high life he is leading an ex- 
travagant, selfish life, as well as a dangerous one. 

S. It is well known in soiling experience that cows give a greater 
flush of milk from good early pasture than from having the food taken 
home to them. The change from winter confinement to the rich and 
plentiful crop of grass, along with the easy conditions under which they 
obtain it, does this ; were this grass rush to continue there would certain-

ly be much less in favour of housing ; but it does rarely keep up and 
while there is not so much milk in April, May and part of June, there is 
a continuous flow, with no falling off through July, August and Sep- 
tember.

BEEEDS OF CATTLE, 
THE DURHAM. 

PARTI-COLOURED race, once spoken of as Tees- 
water, sometimes Durham, but now almost universally 
called Short-horns. It varies in colour from dense red 
to pure white, and is found in all combinations of these 
two colours. Its skin may be all red or all white, or 
red and white in separate patches, or the colours may 
be blended together as roan, which itself may either 
cover the whole body or be distributed in markings on a 
white ground. Although many of the best Short-horns 
have been white, this colour is not commonly liked, and an endeavour is 
generally made to get away from white. Any appearance of black or grey 
is held to indicate impurity of blood ; yet it is certain that black noses do 
occasionally occur even in herds of very fashionable breeding ; whilst 
black tipped horns arc a not uncommon blemish. But the breeders of 




THE LIVE STOOK OF THE FARM.

Shorthorns are less bound by restrictions of colour than are those of any 
other variety. 

The date since which the Short-horn has had a distinct existence has 
been disputed. The foundations of the breed were assuredly laid many 
years before it obtained any universal popularity. It certainly existed in 
the valley of the Tees quite in the early years of the last century, if not 
before ; and visitors to Durham and Yorkshire, as far back as 1700, 
brought back wonderful stories of the size, weight, and yields of milk, ob- 
tained from Teeswater cattle. The variety is believed to have been pro- 
duced by crossing a very large white breed (of whose origin there is no 
very definite account but which still lingers in places) with some local 
cattle which the rich pasture, enjoyed through many generations, along 
the banks of the Tees, had caused to become unusually fine. The brothers 
Robert and Charles Colling, of Kettcn, have become associated with the 
reputation of the Short-horn to the entire exclusion of older breeders. 
When in 1820 a committee was appointed to obtain pedigrees, with a 
view to establish a herd-book, the committee accepted a connection with 
Messrs. Ceiling's herd as being sufficient to establish the position of any 
candidate for registration : and comparatively few pedigrees got inserted 
in the first volume which do not trace to a cow bred by one of the Messrs. 
Colling or to an animal bought from them. Their names are thus part 
and parcel of the pedigrees of the entire breed. 

For some years past considerable rivalry has existed between the ad- 
mirers of two different strains of Short-horned blood to wit, that derived 
from Mr. Bates' herd and that which is possessed by the Messrs. Booth. 
Thomas Bates, of Kirklevington, dispersed his herd in 1850, at which 
time it was unequalled by any other in existence magnificent size, straight 
and broad back, arched and well spread ribs, wide bosom, snug shoulders 
clean neck, light feet, small head, prominent and bright but placid eye ;' 
hide sufficiently thick to indicate excellent condition, its extraordinary 
elasticity, together with the soft furry texture of the coat evidenced, 
throughout the herd, excellent quality of flesh and disposition to rapid 
fattening. 

The Booth family have been long celebrated as breeders of Short-horns, 
but of late years their herd has become especially famous, not only on ac- 
count of the numerous honours obtained by it at the national shows, but 
also from the great improvement which the Booth blood makes in a herd. 
The far-famed Booth herd was commenced about 1790, by Mr. Thomas 
Booth, with well selected cows of the then existing Short-horns, which he 
put to the best of Robert Colling's bulls, among which was Twin Brother 



-,(JO THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

to Ben (6GO). After these he used Son of Twin Brother to Ben Suwarrow, 
Easby, and the Lame Bull. 

Cattle of the pure " Booth blood" are distinguished by their mellow- 
ness, the depth and width of their fore- quarters, and consequent fulness 
of girth, the uncommon spread of their ribs, their good backs and loins; 
but they are sometimes deficient in style, and rather plain in the head, 
and coarse in the horn, which peculiarities were brought in by the Leon- 
ard cross, and came to him from Thorpe (2757), the sire of Leonard (Lord 
Lieutenant) having been got by Thorpe. The celebrated Favorite had 
something of the same defect, being rather coarse in his horn. The 
Duchess tribe, on the other hand, are characterized by a great deal of ele- 
gance in the head and neck, but this is accompanied with defects, such as 
barrenness in " the side of the chest," " shoulders rough and prominent in 
their points, and bare of flesh," as has been truly said by Mr. Carr. On 
the other hand, to use Mr. Carr's well chosen words, in a Booth animal, 
" the neck, fine at its junction with the head, increases rapidly, though not 
abruptly, in size until it melts insensibly into the shoulders and wide pro- 
jecting brisket, which again blend imperceptibly with the crop, fore-flank, 
and ribs, without any depressions or protuberances. When the animal 
walks the elbow joint is scarcely, if at all, seen, and there is no hollow 
behind it. The motion of the shoulder-blades and shoulder-points is im- 
perceptible, the former being laid snugly back into the crops, the latter 
hidden by the full neck vein, which blends with the muscles of the 
shoulder, neck, and brisket, forming gently tapering lines to the head and 
breast end." Now that the heat of rivalry has somewhat cooled down, 
and that the respective upholders of each of these famous strains of blood 
are prepared to acknowledge the merits of the other, it is considered that 
a judicious blending of the good qualities of each would be highly desir- 
able ; and such a union is, in fact, considered by several eminent breeders 
to be the very acme of Short-horn breeding, and is being practised as we 
write, November, 1883. 

" The colours which belong to the Short-horn are rich red, pure white, 
and a mixture of the two in great variety, the most fashionable being a 
roan, more or less deep. A yellowish red is also occasionally met with, 
but it is not so much liked, although it prevailed at one time in some of 
the best animals of the breed ; Hubback, for instance, was "yellow, red, 
and white." We have no right to object, therefore, to animals of that 
colour, on the score of purity of blood, although we have heard it done. 
Many dislike a white, but this seems rather a prejudice than an objection

which can be traced to good grounds. It has been justly remarked " that 
some of the very best of the improved Short-horns have been white ones.'' 
The following is a description of the Short-horn breed, from the pen of 
Mr. R. Smith, in the " Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society :" " He 
should have a symmetrical and compact form, of sufficient size, on shortish 
legs ; the body should be covered evenly with flesh, of a mellow and elas- 
tic nature, yet firm enough and springy to the touch, following the fingers 
when the pressure is withdrawn ; the forehead should be open, without a 
contracted air about it, and tapering gracefully to the muzzle ; the eye 
prominent, yet placid ; neck moderately long, nearly running into the 
shoulders, which should be well laid, gracefully fitting into the fore-quar- 
ters ; the girth good over the heart ; the fore-arm, where it joins the body, 
broad and tapering, with fine bone below the knee, and fitting level into 
the girth, and so maintaining a straight line along the whole animal to the 
extremity of the hip ; the neck vein should be prominent and well filled 
up with flesh, running neatly into the shoulder-points, which should not 
be prominent, (i.e. rough), but well covered, and the muscle on the outside 
of the shoulder being well developed ; the ribs should spring well and 
level from the backbone, increasingly so towards the back rib, which 
should be well home to the quarter in fact, the space here (termed the 
false rib) should carry on in a straight line over the hip, gradually taper- 
ing on the side bones at the tail, but the quarter must be well packed 
not "scooped out," so to speak; the hip-bones should be dovetailed into 
the quarter and false rib so completely that one ought to be at a loss 
where to find them i.e. they should not be too recognisable ; the flank 
will then, as I have already said, be deep and full, forming a parallel line 
with the animal's back from the bottom of the girth ; the back, again, 
from behind the top of the shoulder all along the vertebrae, should be well 
covered ; the loins should be wide and thick ; the edge-bone, or ridge, 
along the quarter should form a straight line in continuation with the 
back, and should also be well covered (which, in a great many animals, it 
very imperfectly is) to the same level : the twist should be straight down 
(square), moderately wide and deep, containing a great deal of heavy flesh, 
and the legs should be well under the animal ; there should be a thick 
coat of mossy hair, not sharp, or what is termed wiry. Altogether, such 
an animal will have an ease and grace of motion as it walks which is only 
attained when the whole formation is in perfect harmony. There is, in- 
variably, too, a style and grandeur of appearance unmistakably stamping 
the " high caste " Short-horn. Many well-bred animals will not feed 
level, but get patchy, which is fatal to them as show animals, however 
jj 



5(32 THE HOME, FABM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

stylish and fashionable in their outline. It is, therefore, indispensable 
that an animal should lay on flesh uniformly on every part, so as not to 
spoil the proportion of the several parts. Rough shoulders are always ac- 
companied by heavy open shoulder-blades, and a slack bad girth, deficient 
through the heart as well as at the top of the plates immediately behind 
the shoulder. The animal is also sadly deficient in neck vein, being weak 
and ill-tilled where it joins the shoulder-points. Again, however good an 
animal is in all other respects, it is imperative that the hind-quarter be 
well finished and neat ; nothing proclaims a low-bred character so dis- 
tinctly as an ill-turned quarter, if the tail is not neatly set on, failing to 
come well out to form the square at the twist, you may be sure something 
is wrong. While, however, the tail is well set on, and the side bones suf- 
ficiently high to carry the flash fully up to the level of the quarter, there 
should not be any redundancy to mark and separate the rumps from the 
adjoining quarter. The hind legs must not be overlooked : if the hocks 
are too much bent, too long, or not well within the animal, it is a serious 
objection. The hind legs should be nearly straight, and well under the 
animal ; this not only looks well, but is a mark of strength, as obviously 
as the reverse is one of weakness-"

HEREFORD CATTLE. 

The Hereford is a distinct and pure breed of great antiquity. Their 
early history is uncertain ; but it is generally allowed that there has been 
a breed of cattle red and mostly with white face and markings for at least 
two hundred years in the county of Hereford and the neighbouring coun- 
ties. It is asserted that Lord Scuddamore, who died in 1671, introduced 
cows of the red and white face breed from Flanders. There was also a 
breed of cattle known in Herefordshire that were " white with red ears," 



56G THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

and so far back as the tenth century it is recorded that there was a law of 
fixed compensation to be paid for injury done by one prince to another at 
one hundred white cows with red ears and a bull of the same colour. And it 
may be fairly considered to be proved that the Herefords of to-day have 
sprung directly from the old breeds of the district, the old grey Hereford 
coming from the white cattle with red ears, an occasional white Hereford 
cropping up as an additional proof of this. 

There used to be three distinct kinds of Herefords : the mottle-faced, 
the grey, and the red with white faces. The first-mentioned were usually 
the largest, but with great quality and good touch ; the grey were good 
feeders, and of a medium size; while the red with white face usually 
were the smaller cattle, finer in bone, and altogether more taking to the 
eye; and these by degrees excluded the others, and now reign tri- 
umphant. 

There is rather a prejudice against cattle of a light red colour ; although 
the light red, as a rule, are of better quality and feed quicker than the 
dark red 'ones. The late Lord Berwick's cattle were usually of this light 
red colour, and they were always, as their descendants now are, celebrated 
for their quality and aptitude to lay on flesh. The early records of the 
breed show that they were carefully bred in 1766 by Mr. Tompkins and 
others. The Herefords of that period were of great size, and usually kept 
for working on the land and fed off afterwards. 

One of the first who set to work to improve the Hereford type, and get 
them to mature earlier, was the late Mr. Knight, of Downton Castle. The 
Downton herd sprang from three of the best herds of that day Mr. 
Tully's, Mr. Tompkins', and Mr. Skryme's. The last-named was charac- 
terized by the light red colour mentioned before as being usually the 
colour of Lord Berwick's tribe of cattle, which is descended in a distinct 
line from the Knight herd. The darker colour and signs of the old tick 
face come from the Tompkins blood, as his cattle were usually mottle- 
faced ; and the Tully cross gave the greys for which Downton was so cele- 
brated. 

Such is an outline of Hereford history from the latter half of the last 
century up to about 1844. Most of the Hereford breeders of the present 
day follow the type set by Lord Berwick and Mr. Knight, and endeavour 
to get their cattle deep-bodied, heavy-fleshed, on short legs, and small 

bone. 

The chief points to be looked for in a good Hereford are, first, that the 
colour should be a distinct red, not too dark or too light ; white face and 
mane, also white face and belly end to tail and white legs as far as the 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 5(57 

knee and hock, sometimes running up to the flank. The bull should have 
a good, masculine head, not too long, broad between the eyes, which latter 
should be large and prominent, with a mild look, denoting docility of 
temper; the horn should be of moderate length, springing straight from 
the head. The cow's head should be much the same, but finer, and her 
horns should have a mane and turn upwards slightly ; they should be in 
both cases of a waxy white, although they are occasionally found tipped 
with black; the nose should be a pure white or flesh colour. The bull 
should have a good rise of crest, deep, sloping shoulders, well-developed 
brisket, straight back and belly line, wide loin, good springing ribs, mod- 
erately broad hips, tail well set on and falling in a plumb line to the hocks. 
The hind-quarters should be long from the hip backwards ; the thighs, 
which are a very important point, should be large and full, showing plenty 
of width across when you stand behind, and they should be well meated 
to the hocks ; the whole carcass should be set square on good, short legs 
standing well apart, and be covered with firm flesh of good quality, and a 
mellow hide of soft but not too fine hair, giving the impression when you 
touch it, that it will stretch to any extent. 

THE DEVON. 

There are two types of the breed, the North Devon being smaller 
than those fed on the rich lands of Somerset. Mr. Francis, of Quartly, 
has the honour of being looked upon as the introducer of this breed, 
and nine-tenths of the present herds are descended from the Quartly 
stock. In South Devon there is a mixture of the pure North Devon with 
a larger breed of the same kind called the "Old Marlborough Red," which 
is said to have descended from the South Molten stock. " In the North 
Devon the head is small, clean, and free from flesh about the jaws ; deer- 
like, light and airy in its countenance ; neck long and thin ; throat free 
from jowl or dewlap ; nose and round its eyes of a dark orange colour 
ears thin and pointed, tinged on their inside with the same colour that is 
always found to encircle its eyes ; horns thin, and fine to their roots, of a 
cream colour, tipped with black, growing with a regular curve upwards, 
and rather springing from each other ; light in the withers, resting on a 
shoulder a little retiring and spreading, and so rounded below as to sink 
all appearance of its pinion in the body of the animal ; open bosom, with 
a deep chest or keel ; small and tapering below the knee, fine at and above 
the joint, and where the arm begins to increase it becomes suddenly lost 
in the shoulder ; line of the back straight from the withers to the rump, 



568 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

lying completely on a level with the pin, or buckles, which lie wide and 
open ; the hind quarters seated high with flesh, leaving a fine hair-ham 
tapering from the hock to the fetlock; long from rump to huckle, and 
from the pinion of the shoulder to the end of the nose ; thin loose skin, 
covered with hair of a soft and furry nature, inclined to curl whenever the 
animal is in good condition and in full coat, when it also becomes mottled 
with darker shades of its permanent colour, which is that of a bright blood 
red, without white or other spots, particularly on the male ; a white udder 
is sometimes passed over, but seldom without objection." 

This description may be considered as a summary of the perfections 
as to the exterior appearance of the animal : what, under the same headi 
may be regarded as defects, appear first in the sudden retiring of the rump 
from behind the huckle to a narrow point backwards ; the great space 
between the huckle and first rib ; the smallness of the angle inwards at 
which the ribs appear to be projected from the spine or back-bone, often 
giving the appearance of a flat-sided animal, and in its being so much 
tucked up in the girth as to show an awkward cavity between the keel 
and navel, the line of which, it is presumed, should always be found to 
hold a position as nearly as possible parallel with that of the back from 
the withers to the loin. The animal is, however, generally well grown, 
and filled up behind the shoulder. 

THE NORFOLK POLL, OR NORFOLK BED POLL. 

The Norfolk Polled Breed, known as the " Norfolk Red Poll," is by 
some held to be the original breed of that county ; by others to be the re- 
sult of crossing with the polled Galloway cattle, large numbers of which, 
at a very early period in the history of the county, were imported into it. 
It would appear, however, from records recently disentombed from amidst 
the many connected with the county, that there was a true native breed 
or race of cattle having some of the peculiarities of the present breed. 
This original or county breed, if so it was, had, as the favourite colour, a 
deep blood-red, for the body, with a white or mottled face. They, how- 
ever, had horns, but these were small, or at least middle-sized, and clean cut. 
The body was small-boned, but with good round barrel, set on short legs 
" well loined and thin thighed." The head was fine. This breed were good 
fatteners, taking on meat evenly, and finishing off at three years as freely 
as other breeds at four and five. They were hardy and were favourites 
with the grazier and the butcher. The present breed possesses, no doubt, 
the peculiarities of the Galloway, with which at an early period it was 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 559 

crossed. It is held in high esteem, and there are, according to The Field, at 
least a hundred farms in the county in which fine herds of it are bred. 
The oldest herd is that established by Mr. George, of Eaton near Nor- 
wich, in or about the first decade of this century, and the most recent is 
that of Mr. Brown, Markham. Between these are the herds of Sir Wil- 
loughby Jones, Bart. ; of Messrs. Hudson, of Quarles Gamley and Blake- 
ney; Mr. H. Birbeck, Stone, Holy Cross, &c. 

The following are the points of a superior animal, as laid down by Eng- 
lish breeders : 

Colour Deep red, with udder of the same colour, but the tip of the 
tail may be white. 

Nose neither dark nor cloudy. 

A neat head and throat. 

A full eye. 

A tuft of hair should hang over the forehead. The frontal bones should 
begin to contract a little above the eyes, and should terminate in a com- 
paratively narrow prominence at the summit of the head. 

In all other particulars, the commonly accepted points of a superior ani- 
mal are to be taken as applying to the Norfolk Red Polled Cattle. 

" THE SUFFOLK POLL," OR " SUFFOLK Dux." 

The " Suffolk Polled Cattle," known frequently as the " Suffolk Duns," 
so far as their history can be traced, has been a polled breed from the 
earliest period in the history of the county. The colours usuallv met 
with are light dun 'hence the above name), red and white, or yellow and 
white. The hair is tine and silky, the skin thin ; the cows are excellent 
milkers, the head in some being very fine, and the general outline showing 
indications of thorough breeding. As milkers, indeed, it seems scarcely 
to admit of a doubt but they are more valuable even than breeds such as 
the Ayrshires and Alderneys, which have, or are held to have, the highest 
reputation ; and for this, if for no other reason, that they have not the 
tendency to "go dry," like the Ayrshires and Alderneys. 

The steers have, on the whole, good form, the chines and back good ; 
they are somewhat deficient in fulness in the front, this being narrow as 
compared with hindquarters. The cattle sent out by the best breeders 
to the various shows are such as prove the value of the breed ; few but 
what are fit, in the words of an eminent breeder from another county, to 
" go to any show-yard." One peculiarity makes them very valuable to the 
grazier their hardness, which enables them to fit themselves for a wide 



570 TH E HOME, FAEM AND BUSINESS'CYCLOP^EDIA. 

range of districts, and to thrive in situations exposed to cold winds where 
other cattle would not do at all. This also helps them to improve even 
on such poor pasture lands that would be quite unfitted for the keep of 
cattle of other breeds. 

THE GALLOWAY. 

In the county of the same name, and holding the honour of 
having improved the Norfolk polls, the Aberdeen Angus poll, and even 
the Short-horn breed, is hornless, with sometimes a small loose excres- 
cence, or " scur," resembling a horn. They are black, or a dark brin- 
dled brown, straight and broad in the back, and nearly level from the 
head to the rump. They are' round in the ribs, and also between the shoul- 
ders and the ribs, or the ribs and the loins. They are broad in the loins, 
without any large projecting hook-bones. In roundness of bone and ful- 
ness of ribs they will compare with any breed, and also in the proportion 
of the loins to the hook-bones, or protuberances of the ribs. They are 
long in the quarters and ribs and deep in the chest, but not broad in the 
twist. The slightest inspection will show that there is less space between 
the hook and hip-bone and the ribs than in most other breeds, a consid- 
eration of much importance ; for the advantage of length of carcass con- 
sists in the animal being well ribbed home or as little space as possible 
lost in the flank. 

The Galloway is short in the leg, and moderately fine in the shank- 
bones, with a hardiness and disposition to fatten. No breed is so large 
and muscular above the knee, with room for a deep, broad and capacious 
chest ; the neck is thick almost to a fault. 

The skin is loose and mellow, and clothed with long soft silky hair, and 
handles soft and kindly, so much so that even on the moorland farms their 
hides little indicate the privations they undergo. 

THE WEST HIGHLAND. 

The best Highland breed of horned cattle is reared in the western part 
of Scotland. The horns are large, sharp pointed, and upturned, and the 
colour generally black, though sometimes brindled or dun. The hides 
are thick and covered with long soft hair of a close pile, which nature 
seems to have intended as a protection against the severity of the climate 
under which they are bred, for they lose much of this distinction when 
reared in a southern country. In other respects they are not unlike the 
Galloway breed, many of whose best qualities they possess, and particu- 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 571 

larly their hardiness of constitution, beautiful symmetry, and finely fla- 
voured flesh. Their straight and level backs, their round and deep car- 
casses, and the quantity of good meat which they yield in proportion to 
their size, are most valuable points. 

Of this breed there are several distinct varieties. The principal are the 
K;/Ioes the aboriginal breed of Scotland, and existing in its greatest state 
of purity in the Isle of Skye. In Perth and Ross, and Argyle, the pas- 
tures will bear a larger breed, and it is in the latter county that the real 
We*t Highlander is to be seen in full perfection. The broad back, the 
short legs, the fine muzzle, and the black-tipped horns, the quality of the 
meat, and the quickness of the fattening, will sufficiently distinguish him. 

The Rev. M. Gillespie, editor of " The Galloway Herd-book," says, " I 
think there can be very little doubt but that the Galloway and West 
Highland breeds of cattle have sprung from the same parent stock, at a 
very remote date. There is a close resemblance, even at the present day, 
between a well-bred polled Galloway and a West Highland minus the 
horns. Indeed the similarity is so great that when we bear in mind the 
fuct that previous to the close of the eighteenth century, almost all the 
Galloways were horned, it is easy to understand how any difference be- 
tween the two types may have been produced by the different circum- 
stances in which they have long been place* 1.' 

THE ABERDEEN- ANGUS POLL. 

There are but three prominent beefing breeds in the world: the Short- 
horn, Hereford and Aberdeen Angus poll. 

Several others are eminent both in quality and adaptability to parti- 
cular circumstances, but none of them have proved equal to these three in 
all that goes to make the modern modsl ox on pasture or in the stall. 
Angus, or Forfarshire, in Scotland, some fifty years ago, took up the im- 
portant question of the improvement of its native cattle upon the princi- 
ples then well known through the success of Short-horn breeders, and ere 
long immense progress resulted. Hugh Watson, of Keillor, was the prin- 
cipal agent and worker-up of all this. He was unquestionably the father 
of not only this branch of these polls, but necessarily, as we shall see, also of 
that of the Aberdeen line. These cattle were hornless, black, good milkers, 
somewhat stiff fatten ers and good at living on "nothing" upon the some- 
what bleak rolling pastures of Angus. The stamp of animal now on hand 
by Mr. Watson's skill and perseverance is consequently very hardy, grand 
graziers, fattening and ripening early on pasture, and, as a natural result 
of man's interference, also good as stall feeders. 



-.72 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

The men of those parts and times were not indifferent to the illustrious 
Durham, as several purchases were already in possession of the more choice 
forms of the north of Scotland, but, in view of securing the more valuable 
characteristics of England's famous beefer, along with a hardier consti- 
tution, or one then supposed to be more suitable to the district, this Angus, 
or " Keillor Doddie " was established. 

The growing importance of the Angus breed led the farmers of Aber- 
deenshire to consider the improvement of their own hornless black cattle, 
and in order to render this more certain and rapid, they made use of the 
larger and best specimens of the Angus. 

William McCombie, of Tillyfoui', stood pre-eminent in this work. His 
object was to secure a larger frame, and, if possible, a better stall feeder 
than the "Watson" type, in short, a "Scotch Durliam," and he succeeded 
beyond all expectation. 

These breeds had their separate herd books until three years ago, when, 
in consideration of their essential oneness, in history, points and charac- 
teristics, they were joined, and hence the new name, Aberdeen Angus. 

At the present day, therefore, we have a polled or hornless breed of 
cattle, entirely black, with occasional spots of white on the belly an d udder 
a deep square frame, having all or nearly all the details that make up the, 
modern Short horn. With the exception, then, of the colour and horn, the 
Aberdeen Angus poll, is practically a Short-horn, but more able to do 
well on indifferent pastures, is as a whole better built behind the shoulder 
and arm, and decidedly better in quality of milk and producing good 
marbled flesh, though not so deep at the pail as 'the average Short-horn, 
nor probably so heavy when matured. 

It is evident from the circumstances under which this breed has been 
established those of hill-side grazing, little grain, and plenty of hay, straw 
and turnips, with severe winters and moderate summers, that for many 
parts of the world they are superior to the'Short-hom and Hereford. They 
have every year during the last quarter of a century so successfully com- 
peted with all other breeds, that their extension in Britain and impor- 
tation to most civilized countries is becoming a thing of common occur- 
rence. 

The Ontario Experimental Farm has had a herd of them for seven years, 
having been the first to ^introduce to Canada, and now extensive impor- 
tation are being made to other parts of Canada, as well as the United 
States and 'Australia. 

In view of the great field now open for the raising of cattle upon the 
prairies of North America, several importations are being made of the

best animals of this breed for the purpose of improving the common 
herds. 

The head of the Aberdeen Angus poll bull should not be large, but 
handsome and neatly set on. The muzzle fine, nostrils wide, distance from 
nostrils to eyes of moderate length ; the eyes mild, large and expressive 
the poll high ; the ear of fair size, lively and well covered with hair; the 
throat clean, with no development of skin and flesh beneath the ja\\ - 
which should not be heavy ; the back pretty long to the shoulder tip, 
and surmounted by a moderate crest. The neck should pass neatly and 
evenly into the body, with full neck-vein. The shoulder-blades should 
lie well backwards, fitting neatly into the body, and not lying awkwardly 
outside it : they should show no undue prominence on the shoulder-top, 
on the points, or at the elbow. An upright shoulder in cattle is generally 
accompanied by a light waist an important, and in all breeds a much 
too common, defect. The chest should be wide and deep, so as to give 
plenty of room for lung development. The bosom should stand well for- 
ward between the fore-legs, and underneath should be well covered with 
flesh and fat. The crops should be full and level, with no falling off be- 
hind them ; the ribs well sprung, springing out, barrel-like, and neatly 
joined to the crops and loins ; the back level and broad; the loins broad 
and strong ; the hook-bones not too wide narrower than in an average 
Short-horn ; the quarters long, even, and rounded, with no hollow from the 
hooks to the tail. The tail should come neatly out of the body, not too far 
up the back, and not higher at the root than the line of the back. A 
high tail-head was to some extent characteristic of the ancient polled 
breed, but it is one of the defects that are being gradually removed by the 
more scientific systems of breeding now pursued. 

Some good polled cattle, too, have been found to show a development 
of soft worthless flesh and fat on the rounds behind ; but that defect, 
which is disliked very much, is also almost obliterated. The tail should 
hang straight down, close to the body all the way till it comes near to the 
level of the flank. On both sides of the tail the quarters should turn 
away in a rounded manner, swelling out downwards, and ultimately pas- 
sing into thick deep thighs. The twist should be full, and the hind legs 
set well apart, and not detached from the body until the level of the 
flank is reached. The flank should be full and soft, so that a good hand- 
ful may be got out of it. The bottom line should be as even as the top 
and side lines ; and the bones of the legs fine, flat, and clean, with plenty 
of muscle and flesh above the knees on the fore-legs. The body should 
stand neatly and gracefully on the legs ; and when the animal is station- 



574 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ary, the fore-legs should be perfectly straight, and the hind-legs very 
slightly bent forwards below the hook. All over the frame there should 
be a rich and even coating of flesh. Even the hook-bones, and other pro- 
minent parts, should be well covered ; and above all, there should be no 
patchiness no hollows, and no rolls of hard flesh, with spaces of soft use- 
less fat between them, such as are always found in a patchy animal. 
Except in rare cases, the skin is fairly thick, but soft and pliable ; it 
ought to be so free over the ribs, as that one could fill one's hand of it. 
The hair is, as a rule, not long, but fairly thick and soft ; and in the best 
animals_shews two growths, or rather two lengths one short and thick 
and the other longer and thinner. When walking, a good animal of the 
breed presents a very compact, graceful, and symmetrical appearance. 
Indeed it is fairly enough claimed for the breed that in these and some 
other respects it has hardly any equals, and no superiors. The above 
description refers more correctly to bulls than to cows. The latter, of 
course, differ considerably in character. The head is much finer, the neck 
thinner and cleaner, with no crest ; the shoulder-top sharper ; the bone 
altogether finer, the skin not quite so thick ; the udder large, and milk- 
vessels large and well-defined. 

THE AYRSHIRE BREED. 

In Ayrshire, an adjacent portion of the Lothians, this had its origin. 
At some period or other there has evidently been a cross of the Durham 
or Holderness, and perhaps also of the Alderney, used in perfecting their 
milking properties, and they have been established as a distinct breed for 
over one hundred years. 

The following is from a report to the Ayrshire Agricultural Association, 
and gives the "points" which indicate superior quality in the Ayrshire 

dairy cows : 

" Head short, forehead wide, nose fine between the muzzle and eyes, 
muzzle moderately large, eyes full and lively, horns wide set on, inclining 
upwards, and curving slightly inwards. 

" Neck long and straight from the head to the top of the shoulder ; free 
from loose skin on the under side, fine at its junction with the head, and 
the muscles symmetrically enlarging towards the shoulders 

" Shoulders thin at the top, brisket light, the whole fore-quarters thin 
in front, and gradually increasing in depth and width backwards. 

" Back short and straight, spine well defined, especially at the shoulder, 
the short ribs arched, the body deep at the flanks, and the milk veins 
well developed. 



THi: LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM 575 

" Pelvis long, broad, and straight, hook-bones (ilium) wide apart, and 
not much overlaid with fat, thighs deep and broad, tail long and slender, 
and set on level with the back. 

" Milk-vessels capacious and extending well forward, hinder part broad 
and firmly attached to the body, the sole or under surface nearly level, 
the teats from two to two-and-a-half inches in length, equal in thickness, 
and hanging perpendicularly ; their distance apart at the sides should be 
equal to about one-third of the length of the vessel, and across to about 
one-half of the breadth. 

" Legs short, the bones fine and the joints firm. 

" Skin soft and elastic, and covered with soft, close, woolly hair. 

" The colours preferred are brown, or brown and white, the colours 
being distinctly defined." 

JERSEYS. 

In the British Channel, between Great Britain and France, are a num- 
ber of islands noted for their salubrity of climate and fertility of soil. Of 
late these islands Alderney, Jersey and Guernsey have become cele- 
brated for their breed of cattle. They are undoubtedly of French origin 
Their colours are mostly light red or brown and black, mixed and splashed, 
with white. The solid colours are generally favoured. 

Beginning with the head the most characteristic feature the muzzle 
is fine, the nose either dark brown or black, and occasionally a yellowish 
shade, with a peculiar mealy, light-coloured hair running up the face into 
a smoky hue, when it gradually takes the colour of the body ; the face is 
slightly dishing, clean of flesh, mild and gentle in expression, the eye clear 
and full, and encircled with a distinct ring of the colour of the nose ; the 
forehead is bold, horns short, curving inward, and waxy in colour, with 
black tips ; the ear is sizable, thin, and quick in movement. The whole 
head is original and blood-like in appearance, more so than in almost any 
other of the cattle race, reminding one strongly of the head of our Ameri- 
can elk. The neck is somewhat depressed would be called "ewe-necked " 
by some but clean in the throat, with moderate or little dewlap ; the 
shoulders are wide and somewhat ragged, with prominent points, running 
down to a delicate arm aud slender legs beneath ; the forequarters stand 
rather close together, with a thinnish yet well developed brisket between ; 
the ribs are flat, yet giving sufficient play for good lungs , the back de- 
pressed and somewhat hollow, the belly deep and large, the hips tolerably 
wide, the rump and tail high, the loin and quarter medium in length, the 
thigh thin and deep, the twist wide to accommodate a good sized udder,

the flanks medium, the hocks or gambrel joints crooked, the hind legs 
small, the udder capacious, square set, well formed and covered with soft 
silky hair ; the teats fine, standing well apart and nicely tapering, and the 
milk-veins prominent.

No prize shall be awarded to cows having less than twenty-nine points. 

No prize shall be awarded to heifers having less than twenty -six points. 

Cows having obtained twenty-seven points, and heifers twenty-four 
points, shall be allowed to be branded, but cannot take a prize. 

These points, namely, Nos. 28, 29, and 31 shall be deducted from the 
number required for perfection in heifers, as their udder and milk-veins 
cannot be fully developed : a heifer u-ill, therefore, be considered perfect 
at thirty-one points. 

To this we add : 

One point must be added for pedigree on male side. 

One point must be added for pedigree on female side. 

Again, the size of the escutcheon, or milk-mirrors, is a point of especial 
attention. 

In judging bulls, many of the same points will serve. The head will 
not be so small, and the forehead must be broad ; the horns must be tip- 
ped with black ; the neck, arched, powerful, but not too coarse and heavy 
hide thicker than the cow certainly not thin and mellow ; fore legs 
*hort and straight, fore arm large and powerful, full above the knee and 
tirm below it. As in cows, pedigree must have two points, one for purity 
of blood on the male side, and one for purity of blood on the female side. 

COMPARISON OF BREEDS OF CATTLE IN CANADIAN EXPEDIENCE. 

In instituting comparisons between various breeds of cattle, it should 
not be overlooked that circumstances of climate, locality, and soil 
exercise an influence more or less Tiiarked upon their peculiarities, and 
aptitude for fattening and yielding milk or the reverse. The influence 
of the parents is also to be taken into account, and the way in which 



KK 



578 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPS 

these have been reared and fed, and the age at which they are used, and 
the state or condition of their health. The breeder if he is to be success- 
ful must indeed be perpetually on the look-out for circumstances and 
these operating in a variety of ways, form a number, so to say, of direct- , 
i ons which are at all likely to exercise an influence good, or bad, as the 
case may be, on the qualities and peculiarities of his stock. Take, for 
example, dairy cows. The same breeders set up one class of animal as 
the best, to the exclusion of all others, without taking at all into con- 
sideration circumstances which naturally affect their milk-producing 
powers, just as if breed was everything, and food and housing were of no 
account. The two should, if possible, be made to work together. Breed 
is good, if it enables the dairyman to get meat out of his food ; but it 
should be remembered, that both the quality and the quantity of the 
milk, and consequently to a large extent of the butter and the cheese 
made from it, depends more at least largely, as will be generally 
admitted upon the food than the breed. It is a fact well known to 
dairymen that some cows have not the slightest pretension to breed so 
thoroughly mongrel are they are those which give the largest yield of 
milk, and that of the best quality, when once they are put under proper 
feeding and management. As regards different breeds for the dairy, the 
most comprehensive and systematic accounts from anywhere are those 
which have resulted from the experiments of Professor Brown of the 
Ontario Experimental College. His description of breeds in their experi- 
ence up to 1882 is as follows : 

I have never seen, in all the necessary detail, a special work on the 
breeds of cattle most suitable for the dairy and creamery. The discussion 
of the subject is even not as plentiful as might be expected, amid all the 
keenness and ability of our Agricultural Associations. Dairymen are 
either satisfied with what they possess, or, may be, have been waiting for 
their Experimental Station to say something on such a big, irregular, and 
largely uncultivated field of enquiry. I think much of this indifference 
is only apparent, and not real, as age has not yet given Ontario opportu- 
nity to test what, under her conditions, are best for cheese and butter 
respectively. 

To say that we cannot do better than follow what older nations are 
doing in this regard is admitting that the cow is but a machine devised 
to produce, irrespective of conditions that, we know, make and unmake 
higher animal life, and would at the same time be ignoring what we have 
already done in improving upon the practice of other countries in the 
making of cheese itself. It is our place as a young nation to prove as 





THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 



we grow and establish nothing without thorough test again and again. 
That this has been much of our work at the Ontario Experimental Farm 
is well known, and now I have the honour of submitting what various 
breeds of cattle there have said to the Province during the last seven 
years what we get, and what we cannot get from each. 

And first of all I desire to place on record that there exists no such 
thing as General Purpose Cow, as understood by many of us. There is 
no breed of cattle that will fill the butcher's stall, the milk pail, the 

cheese vat, and the butter can, as each should be done in these days and 

must be done in order to the <k-sir, <l .success. That some can do so to a 
greater measure than others we know, but that any one can, or ever will 
do so, and aggregate equal to the average of breeds, is just as certain as 
that cheese is not always cheese. 

Even the world's work of these times is */><;;, ttitie*, and not the one 
man fit to do many things well. Agriculture is speedily and surely 
dividing herself into grain, Hesh, and wool, cheese and butter. 

No two perfect and distinct products, as now required, can be got from 
any one breed of cattle or sheep under any sort of conditions, anywhere, 
however favourable. 

I challenge any one to name a breed of cattle or sheep that gives an 
annual produce of two things equal to the like class of things, from two 
separate breeds that I will name. This provision of nature cannot be 
disturbed by all the science and art of man, and yet few things speak of 
the " Great Balancer " so beautifully as the well-known fact that when 
we give proper market value for all the points of all classes of live stock, 
no one set of them overtops any other to any material extent ; thus, then, 
it is knowing what we want, and securing it. 

The question for Ontario in regard to adaptability of breeds, is not 
exactly what characterizes them in their own lands, but what they are 
able to do after years of trial in the district requiring them. No influence 
is so strong as climate; food with Ontario is not a matter of any trouble 
comparatively, but the ability of individual breeds and animals to with- 
stand the extreme of temperature is the great regulator of settlin^ down 
to business. Of course there are in every breed certain inherent proper- 
ties that cannot be driven out by any form of unsuitability whether 
climate, food, or management and consequently we can build upon their 
perpetuation in a new land, with almost unfailing certainty, yet other 
things submit to physical conditions invariably deteriorating rarely 
improving. 



580 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Ontario has had sufficient experience of several breeds to place them 
exactly either for beef, milk cheese, or butter, and yet we are weak in 
knowledge of others that hold a good name in other countries. I refer 
particularly to the Holstein and Guernsey. This Experimental Farm 
should be in possession of these in view of information similar to what I 
am now about to submit. 

What are the requisites of a first-class daily cow, is the question before 
us in this enquiry. Men differ in their likes of individual animals for 
particular purposes, and much of this will be found to arise from 
experience under various conditions that such and such a stamp of cow 
has done well or poorly, with either, where food, management, and the 
particular class of farm also differ. We forget this too often in comparing 
notes. The cow we want in Ontario for the dairy, on an average of all 
influences, should combine the following qualities. 

An early maturer and breeder, giving her first calf when two and one- 
half years old, not to be a full milker before calving, necessarily, because 
of more trouble and deaths ; a particularly warm hearted mother is not 
wan ted a whole week is sometimes lost by fretting breeds and in- 
dividuals differing very much in this regard. We want both quantity 
and quality of milk for the dairy and creamery ; the cow must be a free 
milker, as in a herd of fifty the loss of time alone in one season would 
amount to actually twenty-Jive days. We should have nothing to do with 
a vicious cow whatever her points may be, as temper affects the very 
quality of the milk, not to speak of other drawbacks. We want, at least, 
twenty pounds of milk per day on an average for two hundred days a 
year. A strict culling out to even this moderate standard would surprise 
us as a province. We hear often enough of the maximums, and some- 
times of the average per season, but never of the minimums. Specific, 
gravity is no true indication of milk quality, and we have tried it by 
nearly three thousand observations on ten different breeds of cows within 
the last three years. More than this I do not require to say at present ; 
neither is the bulk or volume usually called per cent. of cream of much 
significance. The weight of the cream from one hundred pounds of milk 
is the proper criterion, and our model dairy cow should always give eight 
pounds to the hundred. Then again, nearly one-half of that cream should 
be butter a high standard no doubt, but as several items that go to 
make rich milk are largely in our hands, such a proportion can be attained 
unquestionably, I submit to better experience than ours, what cheese 
should be got from every hundred of milk if I said eleven pounds, or

nine only, I might be asking what the management or the cow may not 
be able to influence. 

All these desirable results require a certain machine, which we call a 
cow. Now, just as we build iron and wood to do certain kinds of work, 
we find in nature most clear evidence of cow machinery usually called 
breed, and individual constitution making very different milk from ex- 
actly the same materials, under precisely similar conditions. 

Some remarkably good cows seem to bid defiance to all sorts of stand- 
ards of points, but this does not militate from the value of a standard that 
is known to average all the virtues of cow life. 

I have pleasure in drawing attention to a table that is the result of 
nearly five thousand observation* with ten breeds and grades of cows dur- 
ing the last three years upon seven years' experience of the Ontario Ex- 
perimental Farm, which, though not full, is yet of such extent as must at 
least interest anyone desirous of reliable information.

in the experience of most breeders are remarkable in both qualities ; in 
the days of their early history they were unquestionably deep and true 
milkers, but management towards a different object, has, during the last 
eighty years, changed their dairy standard. Though low in specific 
gravity, the proportion of cream is high, and the quantity of butter from 
the milk the highest of what is illustrated, and possibly second only to 
the Jersey, which, as yet, we have not had opportunity to investigate 
thoroughly. Even in cheese the Shorthorn is among the best, With this 
high average we would expect similar characteristics by the use of this 
breed with the native cows of the country, whether one or more crosses, 
but the table shows no advantage in richness, though a very large increase 
to quantity of milk and duration of the season. This shorthorn grade is 
undoubtedly the nearest approach we have to what is termed a general 
purpose cow. 

In duration of season and quantity of milk, the Aberdeen Poll is not 
equal to the Shorthorn, with which it is comparable as a beefer, and 
indeed it is the lowest of any in quantity, yet giving by specific gravity 
the richest of all excepting the Devon. But in fact nobody would look 
to the Aberdeen Poll for the dairy, though when put to the Canadian, we 
obtain much more prominence in milking powers with a distinct reduction 
in per cent, of cream, and yet, curiously enough, a fully better weight of 
cream. 

The great beef grazier of England, the Hereford, is in.no way better 
than the Shorthorn and Aberdeen Poll in milk quantity, but of any in our 
experience giving the largest amount of butter from cream fully one-half 
weight for weight. Its grade is very prominent in advance of 
it, particularly so in proportion of cream, though one of the lowest in 
cheesy properties. I find on reference to a recent live stock text-book, 
published in England, that the Ontario Experimental Farm is credited with 
placing the Hereford Grade as a creamer. 

Note, thus far, in disposing of the three greatest beefing breeds of the 
world, that value in fair measure, could not be got except from the Short- 
horn grade ($25), on an average of things, and $20.50 from the Hereford 
grade. 

In all our experimental research, no breed can touch the Devon in reg- 
istering a high specific gravity and weight of cheese from milk, both are 
unusually high, and should be accounted for by the dairy expert. I now 
ask for this explanation. The Devon is also a good average in duration 
of milking, and, for its size, fair in quantity of milk, and, over an average 



THE 1,IV STOCK OF THE FARM. 583 

of things, gives S2o per annum hence possibly the cause of its patronage 
in the States. 

Scotland's hardy beef grazier, the Galloway, has made, in our compara- 
itvely small experience of it, at least one unusual record as a milker. I refer 
to the two per cent, of cream, which of course is a very low proportion, 
but it must be explained that the line between milk and cream was a very 
indistinct one, much cream stood below this line and always rose slowly, and 
much never separated from the milk ; evidence, I believe, in any breed, of 
rich milk, so judgment in this case should be cautiously handled. 

We have thus gone through what may be called the mixed field of beef 
and milk, and found but one example that would meet the dairyman's 
order. 

The Ayrshire is unquestionably a heavy milker, long as well as deep, and 
on an average will give five times her own weight in milk per season. 
Observe the somewhat low specific gravity of it, however, and indeed, I 
may ask here how it is that all our true milkers the Ayrshire, Ayrshire 
grade, Jersey and Canadian record an average specific gravity of exactly 
100, as against the prevailing high record of the beefers and the grades ? 
From five to thirteen per cent, is a big difference in this respect. It does not 
mean thinness necessarily, for v want of cream as in skimmed milk, gives a 
higher specific gravity, ami pure cream, as is known, will go as low ;is 
fifty and thirty. The Ayrshire does not give cream, however, but stands 
above the average in cheesyness ; thus, then, with its great quantity of 
milk, we get an average value, supposing we desire to obtain a milk, cream 
butter and cheese mean, of $38 a year, and, by a specialty as in cheese 
alone of $58 a year. 

The Ayrshire, with the Canadian, making its grade, is not improved in 
any respect, in our experience, except one, that is, it continues longer in 
milk, making, however, a well-balanced dairy cow, on the hardy side, and 
suitable for some of our districts. 

And now, what about the world's great creamer the Jersey ? The 
great point of this breed is that one-third of its milk, both in volume and 
weight, is cream, and so, on the basis of valuing milk at three-fourths 
cents per pound, cream at five cents, butter at twenty cents, and cheese at 
ten cents per pound, the Jersey equals the Ayrshire in giving 857 per 
annum. We have no experience of butter from Jerseys, but allowing the 
average of forty-four pounds of butter from the hundred pounds of cream 
as in our experiments, the Jersey would give $88 for butter according to 
ordinary price ; but as Jersey butter is gold it would fetch actually $250 



584 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

in place of $88 Shall we say then that this may be the only class where 
thoroughbreds would pay at high prices for ordinary use ? 

It is not because Canadian cattle if there be such a thing really are 
native only that they are placed in this list. I contend, without any fear 
of being unseated, that by a proper selection of this class of cows we ob- 
tain a higher annual produce for our ordinary dairy purposes than from 
any other in this record, and that they are best adapted to the present 
system of management. As a natural result of general agricultural pro- 
gress not special progress always this special class of cattle will gradu- 
ally disappear, and unless we supplement with something else perbaps 
the Holstein, the Guernsey, or may be a less beefy stamp, by careful selec- 
tion, of the Shorthorn grade, our dairy interests will suffer. I claim for 
what is called the Canadian cow, a better defined position, and a higher 
status than has hitherto been accorded to her. " Pedigree" is well ; " blood " 
is good ; but milk, at a dairy or creamery, is better than either of them. 

EXPERIENCE WITH SOME BREEDS OF CATTLE IN ONTARIO. 

It would not be difficult to sketch the conduct and peculiarities of dif- 
ferent breeds of cattle as known in their own habitat, but, what would be 
the use of such a presentation in comparison with the same thing in other 
lands ? The value to us as Canadians is not so much what is realized in 
Britain, but how they conduct themselves under different circumstances, 
and particularly of Ontario. 

Taking this view as the correct one, 1 cannot do better than present 
your Board with some brief notes on the experience of the Ontario Ex- 
perimental Farm an experience now embracing seven years under one 
man's management. 

The Canadian. I know of no class of cattle so well deserving a tir.st 
notice in these pages as the Canadian. There is a distinct type entitled 
to this name. I do not mean those with a touch of Ayrshire, Devon, or 
any other not even the Shorthorn grade but that moderate sized, milk- 
ing, wirey, active stamp, well known to the average farmer. If this be 
considered as somewhat indefinite, we shall be glad to point to specimens 
here or elsewhere. 

I claim that the Canadian deserves more notice than has ever been 
olven to it public or specific giving a recognised position that cannot 
be doubted. Have we on record anywhere such a description and history 
of the Canadian cow as that, when the time comes, as come it will, when 
the Herd Book editor will require materials with which to trace back to

the beginning? of what with him may be as eminent as any Bates or 
Booth in England? This is no improbable matter indeed, but desen - 
our serious attention. 

Our experience of this breed has been intimate and very satisfactory. 
\Ve hold by clear and substantial evidence for eight years that the Cana- 
dian cow takes no mean place as a milker, a mother, and a field for wide 
work both for beef and dairy purposes. Much of this is due to her dis- 
tinct-character in some respects : she is decidedly content with her av.T 
age circumstances miserable as they be at times can do as well in the 
bush as on clover fields, and responds with her best when the thermome- 
ter is at zero or 90 in the shade. Her quantity of milk is not so large as 
the Ayrshire for six weeks after calving, but far ahead in continuance, 
and therefore, on an average, equal; in civam it is unquestionably superior 
to the Ayrshires. No one well acquainted with the breeds would choose 
the Ayrshire against the Canadian, where hardiness and profits undo 
ordinary conditions were the elements. 

So also in regard to a common source for cheap production of beef with 
a Shorthorn or Hereford bull. Other bulls have not as yet been suf- 
ficiently tried except the Ayrshire and Devon, which cannot compare 
with these two. While small as a beefer, the Canadian cow is roomy a& 
a breeder, and thus affords field enough for such a purpose. 

I am confident that a proper selection of the milking Canadian would 
add immensely to the dairy and beefing interests of the country. 

The Devon. The remarkable feature of the Devon with us has been an 
uniform conduct no coming and going in anything, but an even run of 
breeding, health, and good doing under all conditions. Summer and win- 
ter the Devon is equally at home plump on pasture, and in good heart in 
the stall without grain. They have also been particularly good mothers, 
nursing their calves in a manner superior to anything in our experience. 
The Devon calf is always a full calf on its milk alone rolling in fat and 
with all the build of an old animal. The particular character of the breed 
and rich milk give these results. After weaning, and all up to heiferhood 
breeding there is a distinct heartiness and vigour, on the small scale as iv- 
gards size ; there is no stunting according to their kind, but one has to know 
the kind in order to appreciate the difference between them and the larger 
beefers. We have never got so much milk from a Devon, but in quality 
it is second only to the Jersey. The bull attains to a greater size and 
weight proportionately to the cow than the same thing in most other 
breeds, as his " get-up " is comparatively more of a beefer than, for exam- 
ple, the Ayrshire bull is against the Ayrshire cow. The Devon cow there- 



586 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. g 

fore is a milker in quality and moderate quantity, while the bull gives a 
frame to the steer that compares well with others for beef carrying. . But 
the steer will not mature so early as the Shorthorns, Aberdeen Poll, and 
Hereford, or ever attain the sams weight on an average. 

The Ayrshire. We have a pretty thorough test of the Ayrshire cattle. 
In sure breeding we have no cause to complain nor can anything be said 
against their adaptability in raising a calf. Every cow we have has to be 
milked three and four weeks previous to calving an imperative necessity 
to avoid milk fever ; after calving, two of our best have regularly suckled 
calves, and in addition have had to be milked with the hand twice daily 
for two or three weeks, depending upon time of the year, whether on grass 
or in stall. We have not, however, been treated to that continuance of 
milk that I was intimate with in the Lothians of Scotland the great flow 
lessening more rapidly and dribbling too long. I do not attribute this 
to actual poorer pasture or keep otherwise, but to the great difference in 
climatic conditions and the want of that important variety of grasses se- 
cured only in permanent pasture. It is not true in our experience that the 
Ayrshire cow gives a lash of milk on comparatively bare pasture, in which 
regard she is, on an average, decidedly inferior to the Canadian, but it is 
true that her milk is of that blue type not so rich in cream as charac- 
terizes thetn in their 'own country. A cross between the Ayrshire bull 
and Canadian cow is in good repute as a milker with us ; they do not lose 
in size of frame, and gain somewhat in long milking. A cross with an Ayr- 
shire cow and Shorthorn bull has not shown any advantage in milking 
and very little in build for beefing, though the steer is vigorous and 
growthy, but too slab-sided and wedgy taking too much after the 
mother, Practically then as regards the pure Ayrshire they require good 
treatment in order to maintain their famous milking properties, and I am 
of opinion that an infusion of new blood is as often needed as in any other 
breed not so much a change of bull from any other herds in this coun- 
try as that of a directly imported one, 

The, Hereford. This breed has exhibited a very clear and steady line 
of conduct all throughout. No trouble in breeding, and no petting re- 
quired. The Hereford is a good mother, second only to the Devon in our 
experience, and ahead of its dangerous compeers the Shorthorn and 
Aberdeen Poll. 

We have been charged with partiality and lack of practical experience 
in cattle life, by one of our American critics especially in comparing 
Herefords and Shorthorns. This is not true, and I trust will never be so. 
As responsible to a Liberal Government, and guiding a grand country, it 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 587 

is. above all things, our religious duty to report just how it is in every 
case-^no colouring, no exaggeration, and no understatement of anything 
whatsoever. To say more, is unnecessary ; to say less, would savour of 
want of interest. 

The Hereford, I repeat, has shown an uniformity of conduct quite ex- 
ceptionable along with the Devon ; without grain, winter and summer 
bran excepted, and the usual treat after calving. The Hereford keeps fat 
on pasture and in the stable, never falling off, even when suckling. Greedy 
enough, no doubt down to the horse manure not a specialty, as show- 
ing a want of something, but a consistent looking out for number one. 
We have no breed, as a whole, nor individuals among breeds, that can touch 
the Hereford in maintaining flesh on pasture. Indeed, we have cases of 
too much tendency to covering the ribs, and taking from the calf ; and 
a peculiarity of their build is the being deep in calf and not showing it, 
as is otherwise in most other breeds the calf also coming, without affect- 
ing the mother* appearance much. 

The fattening steer, from the Hereford bull and Canadian cow, is quite 
characteristic. The mai'king is strong and unquestionable; the build is a 
Hereford in almost every detail, the pig ham (as age advances), the round, 
compact barrel, longish rumps, deep twist, and the general low, chunky 
set of the whole animal. 

The Shorthorn. We have never treated one breed of cattle or sheep 
differently from another, unless special circumstances demanded it ; thus 
then, these comparative notes are the more valuable and reliable. I say 
this, here, because Shorthorn history, with us, has been more complicated 
than with other cattle ; not, certainly, by reason of want of variety in 
blood and family, nor even numbers, to make a good average for we 
have, or have had, plenty of both. With Shorthorn leanings, as an in- 
dividual, I can freely and fearlessly, nevertheless, record how Shorthorns 
have conducted themselves with us for seven years. 

We can speak highly of the milking properties in quantity and quality 
of the most of our cows of this breed, making good calves, or reliable 
milkers, as the case may have been. We have nothing to say against the 
sure breeding of the cows, but our four bulls, in these years, have not 
given satisfaction in this respect. Without exception, they have caused 
delay, loss, trouble, and extra expense. Why, I am not prepared to say, 
two were imported and two Canadian bred ; none were ever in such high 
flesh as those of some other herds ; indeed we have noted, very distinctly, 
that those bulls, in best flesh that is, on the heavy side, have been surer 
in getting than those on the less fleshy sHe. But, and I desire most 



.588 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

seriously, to make this "but," once and for all, understood, we have never 
fed Shorthorns differently from others ; if we had done so, this would be 
no experimented station. Understand what I mean by this. If we have 
a two-year-old Shorthorn, with a large frame, weighing 1,600 Ibs., and a 
Hereford, exactly of the same age and of a somewhat smaller frame, 
weighing 1,500 Ibs., we feed them according to weight and size, a little 
more to that weighing the most ; this is in agreement with all rules of 
common sense as well as with science and physiology not breed, because 
we do the same thing with individuals of the like breeds : But, we have 
never fed the Shorthorn, because he was a Shorthorn, nor the Hereford, 
or Aberdeen Poll, because of their kind. This is the true experimental 
idea, we think. If, 'tis said, the choice of individual bulls was bad, then 
the reply is, that three independent judges did so ; if management by want 
of practical knowledge is charged, then the same management had to do 
with the other bulls that have stood so well. If the Shorthorn requires, 
on an average, more drawing-room attention than other beefing breeds, 
then it had better be acknowledged at once and I don't think their ad- 
mirers need be ashamed of the fact. 

We have fattened Shorthorn grades, Hereford grades, Devon grades, 
Ayrshire grades, and Galloway grades for beef, both in the stall and on 
pasture, and nothing equals the Shorthorn, in giving that stamp to pro- 
duce weight in the shortest time on Ontario conditions growth of youth 
on good pasture, and finishing in the stall. 

The Aberdeen Poll. We hold the honour of having introduced this 
breed to Canada as put by Mr. McDonald, the clever author of "Food from 
the West," as well as the recent work on Aberdeen Polls, and who is also 
editor of " The Irish Farmers' Gazette." 

Our experience, thus far, is somewhat irregular : Health and breeding 
have been very good ; milking sure, in moderate quantity and rich, with 
plenty of flesh both in stall and on pasture, yet we have to record an in- 
definite sort of instability, difficult to explain I speak now of the first im- 
ported animals and their progeny, not of 1881 purchases. The instability 
in question has reference to a coming and going of health, especially in 
summer, as indicated by change of coat and general " staring " of the 
whole animal, as if going through a course of medicine. Individual ani- 
mals of any class often do so, as everybody knows, but not a whole herd 
of one kind. There has been no sickness actually. 

Some of the indications in the feeding, etc., of cattle, gathered by 
experiments at the Ontario Agricultural College, are thus summarized : 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 



589 



I. Corn fodder newly cut and drawn from the field when green, cut 
into inch lengths, packed into a common rough stone root cellar half un- 
der ground, and weighted with 600 pounds per superficial square yard, can 
be preserved, except adjoining such a wall, for an indefinite time in a con- 
dition fit for animal food, at a cost not exceeding 81 per ton, exclusive of 
cultivation. 

2. In competition with Swede turnips, ensilaged corn fodder gave fif- 
teen per cent, less milk, thirty per cent, less butter, and a poorer market- 
able butter in colour. 

3. Damaged Wheat can be very economically used in the fattening of 
cattle. Nine pounds per head per day, gave a daily increase of "two 
pounds per head per day, at a cost of 4 Ac. per pound to the live weight, 

4. Rice Meal, in the fattening of cattle, gave a daily increase of 1-81 
pounds per head per day, by the use of six pounds per head per day, at a 
cost of about seven cents per pound. 

o. Barley Meal, in fattening cattle, requires a large amount of other 
foods in association, and \\\ pounds per head per day gave a daily in- 
crease of 2'14 pounds per head per day, at a cost of seven cents per pound 
live weight. 

(J. Corn Meal took the highest place in a daily rate of increase in the 
fattening of cattle; nine and one-fourth pounds per head daily, gave 2'31 
pounds per head per day, at a cost of oic. per pound of the added animal 
weight. 

7. Pea Meal gave the second best daily rate of increase at the least cost 
of all the regular cattle feeding grains. Eight and one-half pounds per 
head daily gave a rate of 2'2S pounds, at a cost of five cents per pound of 
the weight added to the animal. 

8. A pure bred Short-horn steer can be brought to a weight of 1,700 
Ibs. when one month under two years old, or a daily rate of increase equal 
to 2i pounds per day. 

9. Hereford grade steer calves can be made to average 611 pounds in 
238 days, or a rate of 2f pounds per day. 

10. Aberdeen Poll grade steer calves can be made to average 720 Ibs. 
in 273 days, or a rate of two and two-thirds pounds per day. 

II. During winter a 1,000 pound steer will consume daily ten pounds 
hay, thirty-nine pounds turnips, four pounds bran, and nine pounds of a 
mixture of grain, upon which it will add 211 pounds to its live weight. 

12. One pound of added weight to a 1,000 pound steer can be obtained 
from the use of various materials that contain eleven pounds of dry sub- 
stances chemically. 



590 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 



13. By a large variety of experiments with several classes of cattle and 
many kinds of food, we find the actual cost of adding one pound to the 
live weight of a 1,000 pound animal is six cents to the feeder who grows 
his own materials, and nearly twelve cents when the food is bought in 
the regular market, manure and management not considered. 

14. Sugar Beet, weight for weight with mangolds and turnips, and, in 
association with equal kinds and quantities of other foods, gave the high- 
est returns in feeding cattle, or 270 pounds per head per day. 

15. Mangolds gave 2'3N pounds per head per day under similar condi- 
tions to the sugar beet. 

16. Turnips (Swede) added 2'30 pounds per day to the average steer 
that weighed 1,061 pounds under conditions similar to mangolds and sugar 

beet. 

17. There is either a simple natural reason or a hidden chemical one m 
the fact that by the use of less grain ;;nd more roots, cattle gave a greater 
daily return in live weight. See special chapter herewith. 

18. The present market for wool and mutton in Ontario is best supplied 
to the profit of the farmer by the Shropshire Down shearling grade, 
which gives annually fourteen per cent, more value than any other in 
our experience. 

19. There is a remarkable uniformity in the annual value of wool and 
mutton from the grades of Cotswold, Leicester, Merino, Oxford Down 
and South Down, resulting from differences in weight and value of both 

products. 

20. From nearly 5,000 observations the following notes have \ 
tained as evidence of peculiarities, characteristics or other indications of 

breeds of cattle : 

(a) That there is no such class as a " general purpose" breed, one to 
best for the dairyman and the butcher. 

(6) An'average cow for dairy purposes should give 20 Ibs. milk per day 
during 200 days every year; 8 Ibs. of cream for every 100 Ibs. of milk; 
45 Ibs! of butter from every 100 Ibs. of cream, and fully 10 Ibs. of cheese 
from every 100 Ibs.. of milk. 

(c) Bulk, volume, or per cent, of cream, is no safe criterion of the 
quantity of butter in that cream, weight alone is the proper mode of 

judging. 

(d) Breed, as much, if not more than food, affects the quantity 

quality of milk,'cream, butter and cheese. 

(e) In the Ontario Experimental Farm experience the Shorthorn is an 
average milker, short in duration per season, low in specific gravity, high 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 



591 



in per cent, of cream, proportionately high in butter, and also high in 
cheese production. The grade of this breed approaches the nearest of any 
others to what is called a " general pnrpose cow." 

(/) The Aberdeen Poll is low in quantity of milk and the second high- 
est of any in specific gravity. The grade of this breed is much improved 
in milking properties, giving a greater weight of cream, though a lo\v< r 
per cent, of it. 

(#) The Hereford is not more prominent than the Shorthorn and Aber- 
deen Poll in regard to milk, except in proportion of butter from cream, in 
which it is highest. The grade is very prominently in advance, particu- 
larly in proportion of cream, but one of the lowest in cheese. 

(h~) The Devon is most distinct in highest specific gravity of milk, and 
the weight of cheese from milk. We have no experience with the grade 
of this breed. 

((') The Galloway milk appears to be of a peculiar texture rich, or so 
small in butter globules as to rise very slowly and very indistinct in the 
test tube. 

(j) The Ayrshire is a particularly heavy, long milker, giving five times 
her own weight per season. The milk is somewhat low in specific gravity 
and per cent, of cream, but is over the average in cheese production. The 
Ayrshire grade is not improved in any respect except in duration of milk- 
ing season. 

(k) The Jersey is remarkable for proportion of cream, averaging thirty- 
five per cent., and giving a value of dairy products, incomparable to any 
other breed in our experience. 

(I) The Native, or Common Cow of Ontario, not Canada properly, be- 
cause Quebec in particular stands distinct in her class of dairy cftws, takes 
a high place in value of annual produce for ordinary dairy purposes, and, 
along with the Shorthorn grade, is peculiarly the dairy cow for the 
country. 

SHEEP. The British Isles possess at least twenty-five distinct breeds 
of sheep, all of considerable interest at the same time not more than 
seven have as yet taken a prominent position in other parts of the world. 
and necessarily, to those, our descriptions will apply. 

Sheep are classified according to the length of their wool, though they 
differ in other respects as much as in wool ; for example, long-woolled 
sheep yield a heavy fleece, are heavier in weight, yield a somewhat coarse 
mutton, deposit fat thickly on the back, have white faces and legs, are 
well adapted for low-lying and rich lands, and require plenty of room. 



59-7 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Short-woolled sheep, on the other hand, yield a lighter fleece, are lighter 
in weight, supplying mutton of high quality. Their fat and lean are 
better mixed, and they lay on much inside fat. The faces and legs are 
usually brown. They "are naturally fitted for high-lying lands, and will 
bear confinement in folds. 

Under the general term of long-woolled sheep are the Leicester, Cots- 
wold, and Lincoln ; under medium-woolled are the Cheviot and Oxford 
Down ; and short woolled embrace the Hampshire, Lincolnshire, South 

Down, and Merino. 

There is no other domestic animal upon which climatic influences are so 
rrveat. Pure-bred animals, of any of the distinct breeds, when removed 
to a locality where the soil and climate are quite different, will in the 
course of two or three generations gradually change their type. The 
quality of the wool is dependent upon the climate and soil, not less than 
upon the breed of sheep. Generally speaking, the native sheep of a district 
have special qualities, the result of climatic influences, which render them, 
improved by careful selection and breeding, or by crossing with some 
other strain, more profitable to keep in that district than any other 

breed. 

Irrespective of breed, there is now-a-days, a certain type of sheep t 
we look for to fill the " general purpose " bill, and the intelligent reader 
from the following description of a ram will find how near it comes to 
something between the Leicester and South Down : 

With respect to the Ram. His head should be fine and small ; his 

nostrils wide and expanded; his eyes prominent or rather bold and 

daring ; his ears thin ; his collar full from his breast and shoulders, but 

tapering gradually all the way to where the neck and head join, which 

should be very fine and graceful, and perfectly free from any coarse 

leather hanging down ; the shoulders should be broad and full, and at 

. the same time joining so imperceptibly to the collar forward and the chine 

backward, as not to leave the least hollow in either place. The muscular 

development (or mutton as it is called) upon the arm and fore thigh must 

come quite to the knee ; the legs should be upright, with a clear fine bone, 

and from the knee and hough downwards equally clear from superfluous 

skin and coarse hairy wool ; the breast should be broad, and advanced 

well forward, separating widely between the fore-limbs ; the chest should 

be full and deep, with no falling in behind the shoulders; the back and 

loins should be straight, flat and broad ; the ribs rising from the spine, 

with a fine circular arch; the belly should be straight, not bagging; the 

quarters long and full, well fleshed down to the hough ; the houghs should

593 



stand parallel, neither in nor out; the twist or junction of the inside of 
the thighs, wide and proportionate to the distance of the fore-arras, so 
that the pillars of support accord in due symmetry with each other, well 
supporting a rounded and developed volume of carcass. The belt should 
be moderately thin, and the wool fine, bright, and soft. 

Foremost among the long wools stands the Lincoln on account of the 
great weight, and the lustrous character of its fleece. The native sheep 
of the district of Lincoln Heath and wold were originally crossed with 
the Leicester and have been much improved, not only in weight and 
quality of wool, but weight of carcass, symmetry, aptitude to fatten, and 
early maturity have also been improved. With this understanding the 
following is a description of the old stamp of Lincoln : 

The head is small, compact, and hornless ; the face of moderate length, 
and, to use a sculptor's phrase, neatly outlined and chiselled; the lips 
being thin and definite, and the space between the nostrils narrow but 
sharp. The face should be dashed with brownish grey ; the forehead, the 
ears, and the space between the ears well covered with wool. The eye 
should be clear and bright, but not prominent. The neck should have 
a graceful tournure, thin at its junction with the head, but enlarging 
towards the shoulders and chest, The breast should be prominent, wide, 
and deep. The set-on of the shoulder blades should be oblique, and the 
ribs should arch boldly, so as to produce a well-barrelled carcass. The 
loin should be broad and flat, the rump long and broad, the tail set-on 
high, that is, on a level with the back, the hips wide, and close up to the 
last rib on each side. The belly should be well supported and straight, 
and also covered with wool. The limbs should be far apart, muscular, 
and full ; the shanks clean, fine boned, well knit, and covered with short 
woolly hair of a rusty grey or brown tint. The fleece should be short, 
close, fine, curled and free from kemps or projecting hairs. 

Let us next turn to the Cheviot sheep, now improved by crossing with 
the Leicesters. The head is bare and clean, the ears are rather long, the 
chaffron somewhat convex, and the jaws are considerably elongated ; the 
face formerly dusky, as were also the limbs, is now white. The neck is 
full and round, the chest open, and the general contour of the bodv round 
and full. The legs are clean, and clad with wool to the knee joints and 
hocks. The fleece is of a medium length, close-set and fine, and should 
be equal in point of quality on every part ; it is, however, apt to be curled 
about the shoulders, and coarser on the hips, tail, and belly, than else- 
where ; but in the improved stocks a great difference takes place. 



LL 



594 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP-EDIA. 

They have no horns, white faces and legs, forward loose shoulders, a 
heavy head, with a large neck and sinking dewlap; the bones large, and 
the carcass long and coarse ; the back long and hollow, with flat ribs, but 
good loins and a deep belly; the hindquarter broad and the legs 
standing wide apart. The pelt was particularly thick, and the fleece con- 
sisted of very long combing wool, of a rather coarse quality, weighing 
generally from 12 to 14 Ibs. on the wethers and from 8 to 10 Ibs. on the 
ewes. The flesh was coarse-grained and inferior to the mutton of the 
New Leicester, and particularly so to that of the small short-wool breeds ; 
but it frequently reached the weight of 35 Ibs per quarter; and fat 
wethers generally averaged 25 Ibs. 

THE COTSWOLD. Another variety of long-woolled sheep used to be 
found on the Cotswold Hills. They had lived there from time immemo- 
rial, and from the earliest periods of_English history had been celebrated 
for the length and fineness of their fleece, for their hardiness of constitu- 
tion, for their breeding qualities, and the ewes as being excellent nurses. 
They, too, have latterly been crossed with the Leicesters, the Lincoln?, 
and others ; the value of the cross, however, greatly depends on the situ- 
ation of the farm, the selection of the individuals, and whether it will be 
most advantageous for the fanner to cultivate the carcass or the fleece, 
The cross with a Southdown and Cotswold is now in such high estimation, 
that there is every chance of its soon being established as a separate 

breed. 

THE LEICESTERS. There are two types of these : the English Leicester 
and Border Leicester. The former has been cultivated for more than 100 
years, the name of Bake well being very famous in connection with this 
breed in the last century. Bakewell did something in the improvement 
of horses, and not a little among cattle, but his fame will always stand 
highest on having given England her great mutton producer. 

Mr. Bakewell regarded symmetry and aptitude to fatten as first-rate 
qualities ; he found these to be inherent in small, not in large, heavy- 
boned sheep, which latter consumed an extravagant abundance of food 
without returning an adequate profit; whereas the smaller sheep he found 
to increase more rapidly in weight, proportionately, even upon a less con- 
sumption of diet. His experience had also taught him another point, viz., 
that sheep carrying a heavy fleece had always less aptitude to fatten, and 
were far slower in ripening, than those whose fleece was moderate ; and 
he considered symmetry and early ripening to be of more importance than 
the loss of a few pounds in the fleece. In short, he considered that the 
value of the carcass was the first object to be attended to in breeding of 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 



595 



p ; an.l lie looked upon the fleece as of secondary importance not 
that the loss of two or three pounds iu the fleece was not an object, (but 
still he thought that if to preserve this the farmer not only lost ten or 
twelve pounds of mutton by it, but had to feed his sheep twelve or eigh- 
teen months longer than he ought, he would pay dearly for his three 
pounds of wool extra. Mr. Bakewell was right ; and on these principles 
he addressed himself to his task. 

The improved Leicesters are not adapted for a scanty pasturage, over, 
which the sheep must travel all day in order to procure a suffitiency of 
food. They require a good, or at least moderate soil, and on this they 
fatten with incredible rapidity, and are consequently very profitable to 
the breeder. If in the establishment of this breed Mr. Bakewell erred, it 
was in the very little regard he paid to the wool, in which^his immediate 
followers imitated him, some even going so far as to prefer sheep with bad 
fleeces to those with good, as if a fine and perfect carcass and good wool 
were incompatible with each other. But this false notion is now correct- 
ed, and the fleece obtains its due share of attention. 

With respect to the quality of the mutton of the improved Leicesters, 
we do not estimate it so highly as that of some of the short-woolled breeds! 
When not over fat, it is tender and juicy, but destitute of high flavour ; 
but when fattened to a high degree, the interstices of the fibres of the 
muscles are replete with fat in such a manner that the line of distinction 
between fat and lean is almost, as it were, lost ; the carcass appears to be 
a mass of fat, and is anything but attractive. Besides, such meat is not 
profitable to the purchaser, though it may be to the cook. We admit, 
however, that it is the grazier's fault if he carries the fattening process 
beyond the point at which he ought to stop, whether he regards his own 
profit or the interest of the consumer. It is the character of the breed to 
ripen early and quickly. As soon as the sheep are in a proper condition 
for the butcher, the grazier, instead of wasting more food upon them, 
should get rid of them, and commence the feeding of another lot, to be 
disposed of in their turn as soon as ready. 

It is for the accumulation of outside fat that the Leicesters are chiefly 
remarkable. They have comparatively little loose inside fat or tallow a 
point of some consequence to the butcher, who deems this as adding to his 
profit. By way of a counterbalance, however, the smallness of the head, 
the thinness of the pelt, and the general greater weight of the carcass than 
the appearance of the animal would indicate, should be taken into con- 
sideration. Whatever it may be to the butcher, " this diminution of offal 
is advantageous to the grazier ; for it shows a disposition to form fat out-

wardly, and is uniformly accompanied by a tendency to quickness of im- 
provement." In this latter quality the new Leicesters are unrivalled. 

The new Leicesters, with all their good qualities, are not a hardy race, 
neither are they so prolific as many other breeds. The ewes seldom pro- 
duce twins, nor indeed did the founders of this stock deem the production 
of twins desirable. They aimed at bringing forward the lamb as early as 
possible, and rightly considered that few ewes could produce two such 
lambs as would meet with their wishes and realize their object, 
fact, moreover, is, that the exclusive attention paid to the establishment 
of a race, the vital energies of which were to be exhibited in the attain- 
ment of early maturity and in the quick accumulation of fat, while pro- 
ductive of the results aimed at, necessarily entailed counterbalancing de- 
ficiencies A tendency to rapid fattening and early ripeness is not co- 
existent as a general rule, with great fertility. In this point, then, the 
new Leicesters are defective, but less so than formerly. Still the ewes 
not yield any great abundance of milk, and the lambs are tender, delicate, 
and unfitted to endure any great inclemency of weather. 

Such then, are the new Leicesters, to which so many other breeds 
their improvement by crossing : indeed, if we limit our attention to this 
part alone of their history, the benefits resulting from them will be found 
as important as they are extensive. It would be folly to attempt to na- 
turalize the Leicesters on coarse, lean pastures, on wilds, heaths, a 
mountains, they would rapidly degenerate, and few of their lambs, wit 
the best care, would survive the winter ; but, as in the instances of 1 
Cheviots, the hardy mountain sheep may derive no trifling improvement 
from a 'cross, and that too without a loss of hardiness. 

The true type of the breed is as follows: The head should be 
less loner small, tapering towards the muzzle, and projecting horizon- 
tally forward. The eyes prominent, but with a quiet expression, 
ears thin rather long, and directed backward. The neck full and broad 
at its bas'c, where it proceeds from the chest, so that there is, with the 
slightest possible elevation, one continued horizontal line from the rump 
tothe poll The breast broad and round, and no uneven or angular for- 
mation where the shoulders join either the neck or the back ; particularly 
no risin^ of the withers, or hollow behind the situation of the bones, 
The arm fleshy through its whole extent, and even down to the knee. 
The bones of the leg small, standing wide apart ; no looseness of skm 
about them, and comparatively bare of wool. The chest and barrel at 
once deep and round, the ribs forming a considerable arch from the spu 
so as in some cases, and especially when the animal is in good condi 



THE LIVE STOCK OF THE FARM. 597 

to make the apparent width of the chest even greater than the depth. 
The barrel ribbed well home; no irregularity of line on the back or belly, 
but on the sides ; the carcass very gradually diminishing in width toward 
the rump. The quarters long and full, and, as with the fore-legs, the 
muscles extending down to the hock ; the thighs also wide and full. The 
legs of a moderate length ; the skin also moderately thin, but soft and 
elastic, and covered with a good quantity of white wool 

The Border Leicester, not different in blood, but the improved English 
Leicester changed in size, somewhat in form and other points, as brought 
about by physical condition and management in the country having the 
" Borders " between England and Scotland as their home. They are 
larger than the English type, with a whiter face and smaller head, and an 
unusually fine bone, as contrasted with the weight of carcass. They are 
clean in the jaws, with a full eye, thin ears, and placid countenance. Their 
backs are straight, broad and flat ; the ribs arched, the belly carried very 
light, so that they present nearly as straight a line below as above ; the 
chest wide, the skin very mellow, and covered with a beautiful fleece of 
long, soft wool. 

THE CHEVIOT. The Cheviot hills, between England and Scotland, have 
long held a peculiar breed of this name, which can contest in hardiness 
and mutton quality with the Black Face of Scotland. They are hornless, 
and faces and legs in general white ; formerly the prevailing colour of the 
face was black, but repeated crossing with the Leicester have made both 
face and legs white. The best have a tine open countenance, with lively 
prominent eye ; the body is long, the fore quarter wanting in depth at the 
breast, and breadth both there and on the chine. The legs arer fine, clear, 
and small bone, the pelt thin, with moderate weight of coarse wool fleece ; 
their mutton is excellent. 

THE OXFORD DOWN. The Oxford Downs are a fine breed of sheep, like 
the Shropshires of comparatively modern introduction. They have been 
carefully bred as a distinct breed for more than thirty years. They have 
large, handsome frames, like the Cotswolds, but with a black or grey face, 
closer wool, and firmer and better quality of mutton. This breed owes its 
introduction to Mr. Swynham, of Whitchurch, Hants, who about the year 
1830 commenced to cross with a Cots wold ram (the old Cotswold as im- 
proved by the Leicester) and his Shropshire Down ewes the object in 
view being to have an animal which would come to early maturity with 
lai'ge carcass, good fleece, and yet which would possess the hardy charac- 
teristics of the Shropshire Downs. 



598 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSIITOSS CYCLOPEDIA. 

They are of large dimensions, and have a great propensity to fatten, 
arising chiefly from their wide frame, quietude, and open texture of flesh, 
which is of quick growth, and consequently expands itself more rapidly 
than in sheep of other qualities; but they do not possess that exactness of 
form peculiar to smaller animals, though they have a better carriage. For 
many years the male animals have been eagerly sought after, with a view 
to increase the size and frame of other long-wooled breeds. In many re- 
spects these sheep approach the Cotswolds, and are said by their admirers 
to yield finer grained meat. 

Among the first introductions of this breed to Canada were those of 
1876, by the Ontario Experimental Farm, and now they are spreading 
rapidly. 

HAMPSHIRE DOWN. These have recently been much improved in 
frame, quality and early maturing. Their fine, lengthy carcasses, full of 
lean flesh, are much esteemed in England ; the lambs are said to obtain a 
greater weight than those of any other breed at the same age. The face 
is dark, about black, wide head and long, Roman nose, considerable bone, 
and nice short wool. They are esentially a make-up from Southdown and 
Cotswold in their hardiness, colour, wool and mutton resembling the one, 
and in their size the other, having the early maturing of the Leicester 
through the improved Cotswold, as well as the South Down. 

SHROPSHIRE Dowxs, or " Shrops," as their admirers prefer to call them, 
because they consider they have had nothing to do with Down blood, but 
this is disputed ; they are a comparatively new breed, having many of the 
characteristics of the South Down, but heavier in carcass and fleece. The 
frame is losg, wide, and deep, with plenty of lean flesh, with a robust con- 
stitution and aptitude to fatten. In quality of mutton they are excelled 
only by the South Downs and some of the mountain breeds. The ewes 
are excellent mothers and prolific; colour of face and legs, black or 

grey. 

THE SOUTH Dowx. As every prominent iong-woolled breed has been 
improved by the Leicester, so every Down must bow to the South Down 
for a similar reason. They were materially improved and brought to 
their present perfection by John Ellman, of Clyde, who says they should 
have the head small and hornless, the face speckled or grey, the under 
jaw fine and thin, and the whole space betwen the ear.s well protected 
with wool ; the eye full and bright ; the neck thin towards the head, but 
enlarging towards the shoulders, and there broad and high ; the chest 
wide, deep, and projecting between the forelegs ; the shoulders level with 
the back, bowing outwards from the top to the breast, leaving room fora 



BREEDS OF HORSES FOR THE FARM. 

springing rib beneath; the rib coming out horizontally from the spine, 
and the last rib projecting more than the rest; the back flat from the 
shoulders to the tail ; the loin broad and flat ; the hips wide ; the belly a.s 
straight as the back ; the legs neither too long nor too short, fine without 
weakness, and of a speckled or dark colour ; the belly well protected with 
wool, the wool coming down before and behind to the knee, and short, 
close, curled, fine, and free from spiry projecting fibres; the flesh fine- 
grained, and of excellent flavour. 

A good South Down carries more meat in proportion to the offal than 
does any of the other short-woolled varieties. They are very hardy, grand 
foragers, and comparatively free from diseases in consequence very much 
of the character of the chalk soils of the Down hills. In size and weight 
of wool they are inferior to the other Downs, but are early maturers, good 
nurses and prolific. 

THE MERINO. We ha\ T e these from Spain and France, the French 
being considerably the larger. They are spiral horned, white face and 
legs, fine bone and a fine clear pelt. The wool is exceedingly tine and 
weighs heavy ; the best fleeces have a dark brown tinge on the surface, 
almost amounting to black, which is formed by dust adhering to the 
greasy, yolky projection of the pile, a marked contrast to the rich white 
colour underneath, which, with the rosy hue of the skin, denotes high 
proof. 

This breed is highly valued in the United States and Australia, but as 
yet has no place in Canada or even in Britain. So much have the Amer- 
icans done that these may be fairly said to be an American Merino. They 
are not mutton sheep, although their cross, well done to, has made both 
weight and quality at the Ontario Experimental Farm. The length and 
thickness of wool, evenness and firmness of staple, that looseness of skin 
and wool everywhere go to make an American Merino. 

BEEEDS OF HOESES FOE THE FAEM. 

No horses were found either in America or Australia when those con- 
tinents were first discovered. Now, on the almost boundless prairies of 
South America, immense herds, numbering many thousands, are to be met 
with. These mustangs, or wild horses, are the descendants of a race of 
Spanish horses, who escaped from domestication. On becoming emanci- 
pated they bred and congregated in herds. The horse is now to be met 
with in every habitable country, except Lapland and Greenland, in the 
region of eternal snow. 






600 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOP-EDIA. 

The horses of Europe, like the inhabitants, are of mixed lineage. The 
Russian horse is of a small stature, hardy and muscular, capable of great 
endurance, inured by exposure to the hardship of a rigorous climate and 
the privations of an innutritious and scanty fare. The Italian horses of 
the present day are widely diversified in character ; many are powerful 
and well shaped, whilst others are of a light and weedy character. During 
the middle ages large numbers were imported into England for military 
purposes, and no doubt became mixed with the native races. The Spanish 
horse is small and has a strong dash of African blood. For many years 
large numbers of Norman-French horses have been imported into England. 

The first stud-book published in England bears date the 25th day of 
March, 1808, the second volume of which did not appear till 1822. Dur- 
ing the fourteen years which elapsed between the appearance of the first 
and second volumes, the " horses " of 1808 had become " racehorses " in 
1822. From. this slender beginning all the stud and herd books now ex- 
tant trace their origin. From the date of the Roman invasion the native 
r,tce of English horses became much mixed in blood from a small Eastern 
breed supplied to them principally through the medium of Jewish dealers. 
The Anglo-Saxon warriors preferred the powerful black race of Germany 
as representative of the Flemish breed. The Normans, who were skilled 
horsemen, imported the best animals their country could produce for the 
use of their soldiers. And as all horses used for war purposes during the 
middle ages were entire, they rapidly influenced the native breed of the 
country. 

Although the indigenous breed of middle England differed somewhat in 
size from those of the lowlands of Scotland, yet the improvement of both 
was derived from a common ancestry. Both the improved Clydesdale and 
the modern Shire horses were built up through the infusion of Flemish 
blood. During the latter part of the thirteenth and early part of the 
fourteenth centuries a considerable trade was carried on between Scotland 
and the low countries, and in those days of barter it is only fair to suppose 
that the Scottish merchants would sometimes accept horses in exchange for 
goods. 

It is generally considered that the later improvement of draught horses 
in England was principally effected through the importation of a race of* 
black horses from Holland and Belgium. 

The improvement of the horse in this country is now a matter of record 
and history. It has silently, and with no little rapidity been going for- 
ward for more than a century, till we have attained a race of animals 
which probably equal those of any other country for adaptedness to 



BREEDS OF HORSES FOR THE FARM. 601 

draught, the road, and the saddle. This improvement has been mainly 
brought about by the importation of some of the best and stoutest of thf 
English blood. In breeding from these for purposes of utility, particular 
reference has been paid to strength, endurance and speed. The world has 
not seen their equal. No horses surpass our best four mile pacers ; none 
equal our trotters. Tfc would be a superfluous task to attempt enumer- 
ating all the imported horses that have contributed to this improvement. 
Each good animal has done something. 

Besides our unsurpassed blood horses we have others derived from va- 
rious sources, and especially from the different English breeds, all of which 
re variously compounded, with the first and with each other. On our 
north-eastern frontier the Canadian prevails, a bastard but not degener- 
ate race, made up of the French, Norman, and the English or Ameri- 
can. At the extreme south and wast, we have the horse of Spanish 
origin, obtained in his domestic state in Florida and Louisiana ; and from 
another branch of the Spanish are descended the wild horses of Mexico 
and the more northern prairies. These are diversified in character, and 
generally po.ss. . medium size and merit. The Conestoga, a heavy road- 
ster and draught horse of fine symmetry and great power, is principally 
reared in Pennsylvania, and is used for the team and truck. He is an 
amalgamation of several breeds but probably owes a share of his charac- 
ter to the Flemish horse, for which there was a decided partiality among 
the numerous German emigrants of that State. Several varieties of 
ponies are to be found in different sections but principally among the 
French, the half-breed, and the Indians upon the frontiers, who have 
bred a stunted race from the Canadian or wild horse and such others as 
could survive the hard usage and scanty winter food afforded by nature 
and their rude husbandry. Many of these have considerable beauty and 
symmetry, and are fleet, hardy, and spirited. 

The Suffolk Punch is distinguished by the colour, which is chestnut, 
often merging into a dark sorrel, the mane and tail being frequently of a 
light or silvery shade. They seldom exceed sixteen hands in height. The 
breed has been vastly improved within the last twenty years. They 
are compact and well shaped, legs tolerably free from hair, but rather in- 
clined to be round in the bone. They are active and well adapted for 
ploughing and other farm work. Many find their way to London, where 
they are used in brewers' drays and other heavy work. They are gener- 
ally reputed as being trustworthy at a steady pull, at which they will 
again and again renew their exertions. They are reputed to be of Norman- 
French origin, and are said to have been at first introduced into the East- 



602 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

rrn Counties by Norman invaders. Crossing with other varieties has 
been tried, but the result has generally been disappointing. The pure 
breed, except on the home farms of noblemen and large landed proprietors 
has not, however, made much progress beyond its native district. Within 
the last few years there has been a growing demand for good specimens 
for importation. These have frequently realized high prices. The estab- 
lishment of a stud-book, and the fostering care of a vigilant executive, will 
tend to improve and enhance the value of the breed. 

Tlie Cleveland Bay may be considered more of a carriage than an agri- 
cultural horse. The breed takes its name from the rich valley of Cleve- 
land on the river Tees, in the North Riding of the county of York. The 
prevailing and most fashionable colour is bay, with black legs. Many 
are sixteen hands ami upwards. They are particularly active, hardy, and 
of great endurance. For general tillage purposes, on light soils they can- 
not be surpassed. It is generally supposed the breed was established by 
mating the blood horse with the native mares of the district. By stil! 
crossing the Cleveland mares with the thoroughbred, most of the fine car- 
riage horses in the country are produced. Those with more bone and 
strength, though somewhat deficient in style and action, are in groat de- 
mand in London and the large provincial towns for fpring-carts and light 
vans, used in the speedy despatch of merchandise. The thoroughbred 
stallion and the Cleveland mare form a good alliance, and many valuable 
weight-carrying hunters are now thus bred in these days. But a weight- 
carrier is of little use unless he can go at a racing pace for a burst of 
twenty minutes, and successive crosses of pure blood are needed to in- 
crease the powers of speed and endurance. When carried too far, sub- 
stance and strength are at length sacrificed. 

The Clydesdale. This breed derives its name from a district of consid- 
erable extent, through which the river Clyde winds its course. Taking 
Glasgow as a centre, the country for miles in every direction, is teeming 
with an industrial population. The h Hughs of Clyde are celebrated far 
and wide for the superior excellence of their pastures ; and here the breed 
has long been located, and then fostered and improved through the en- 
ergy and intelligence of those interested and engaged in the business of 
agriculture. No district can vie with that of Clydesdale in the care be- 
stowed on the breeding, rearing, and management of the horse, and the 
labour has not proved unfruitful to those interested in the noble animal. 
A visit to the Glasgow Stallion Show will well repay the student. The 
prevailing colours of the breed are black, brown, and bay. A grey some- 
times makes its appearance; but a stallion of that colour, however perfect 



BREEDS OF HORSES FOR THE FARM. (J0$ 



in form, would scarcely be used for stud purposes. The average stature 
is about 16 hands; they are rather long in the body. In the best speci- 
mens the head is lean, eyes full and prominent, neck well arched, and of 
moderate length ; shoulders oblique, chest wide, legs placed well outside 
the body, flat and muscular, with abundance of straight, soft, silky feath- 
ering; ribs deep and well sprung, hocks clean and strong. One of the 
chief essentials in a draught horse is freedom of action. In this respect 
the Clydesdales are superior to most other breeds ; they step out freelv 
with the long, slinging gait peculiar to the race. They are high mettled ; 
and, except from the results of neglect and unkind treatment, are usually 
free from vice. When used in one-horse carts, as they generally are 
throughout Scotland, no other breed of horses can accomplish an equal 
amount of work in a given time. The breedisheld in high estimation, and 
commands high prices. Through the united exertions of a number of 
patriotic noblemen and gentlemen interested in the breed, a society has 
been formed for the purpose of protecting the interests of breeders and 
purchasers, by means of a Stud Book, in which all animals of authentic 
pedigree can be registered at a small cost. This will no doubt greatlv en- 
hance their value, and enable the intelligent breeder to pursue his voca- 
tion with greater certainty of success. 

The Shire Horse. Ancient tradition accords to the rich fen land dis- 
tricts of Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge a distinct race of black 
horses, of tall stature and massive form. Animals of similar characteristic 
type, though varying in size (the probable result of a change of soil and 
climate), were spread over the counties of Northampton, Wai wick, Stafford, 
Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham. Early historical records furnish de- 
scriptive particulars of a similar breed inhabiting Germany, Holland and 
Belgium. They were well known and extensively used by theRomans for 
military purposes ; during the Roman invasion and occupation, no doubt, 
large numbers were brought over to England, and became mixed with 
the native races. The breed appears to have thriven best in a country 
of rank pasture and soft marshy soil. 

The old English black horse was a heavy, coarse animal, with wide 
loin, powerful quarters, and immense bone, generally inclined to be round,, 
with flowing mane and tail, the legs clothed with a profusion of coarse 
hair. Their colour was generallyof a sooty black, with almost invariably 
white markings on the legs and a small white star on the forehead. They 
were of a sluggish temperament. Their short, steep pasterns and upright 
shoulders were fatal to that freedom of action so desirable a quality in 
modern draught horses. Tradition says an Earl of Huntingdon imported 



(304 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



several stallions from Holland for the use of his numerous tenantry on 
Trent-side. Down to the present day a similar race is still in existence 
in Holland, whence most of the horses used in mourning coaches are 
chiefly drawn, 

The old English cart-horse, with all its defects, has been the basis of 
the most valuable breed of draught animals in England. From him has 
descended the Shire horse, good specimens of which are in great demand 
for waggon and dray purposes. 

In the improved Shire horse the head is generally long and lean, the 
profile slightly arched, broad between the eyes, eyes large and prominent, 
ears large, not set too forward ; nostrils wide and clear ; neck long, deep, 
and arched ; shoulders oblique, sprung well into the back, deep from 
withers to shoulder point, and placed well outside the trunk this en- 
sures a wide chest, a most desirable and important point ribs deep and 
well sprung, with small space between last rib and the hip ; round in the 
barrel and deep in the girth ; back short, loins broad and muscular, long 
from hip to hough ; tail well set, buttocks full, dropping well down to 
hock. The feet should be rather large, the heels well expanded, the horny 
substance firm, slightly sloping and free from sand cracks, side or ring 
bones ; legs short from knee to pastern, bone large and flat, well clothed 
with long silky feather, with tassel of hair at lip, knee, and hough ; pastern 
joints long and sloping. The carriage should be good, and the action 
long and slinging. Walking is the principal pace of a draught horse ; un- 
less he can do this well he is of little use. Pace to some extent may be 
improved, but without good shoulders no animal can walk well. 
The Percheron Horse. Few breeds of late have attracted so much atten- 
tion in the United States and Canada as this. They are peculiar to 
Perche, a district in France. Various theories as to his origin and devel- 
opment have been advanced, by interested partizans at times, and again 
by pure lovers of horses who pursued truth for truth's sake alone. 

One writer insists that he is descended from what some call the primi- 
tive or natural horse, the pure blood Arabian, crossed with a stock of 
heavy draft horses existing in that section, but without historic mention, 
prior to the Crusades. He thinks that after the defeat of the Saracen 
chief, Abderame, by Charles Martel, in Vouille, in which battle a host of 
Saracens perished, the cavalry of the enemy, Oriental horses of marked 
character, true Arabs, fell into the hands of the French, thence many of 
these horses were brought by their victorious masters to the districts of 
Normandy and La Perche. Here commixture of blood with a heavier 



BREEDS OF HORSES FOR THE FARM. 

horse of excellent quality followed, and the cross resulted in producing 
the now celebrated Percheron. 

The native race referred to is thought by some to have been the old 
war horse of the Normans heavy, bony and slow good for cavalry use 
during the days of chivalry, when thecarrying of a knight and his armour 
required an animal of great strength and powers of endurance. 

Others think that it was a stock of horses then peculiar to Brittany and 
used for draft rather than for war. 

The old Norman has been described as being capable of carrying great 
burdens at a reasonable rate of speed; to have been large, compact, mus- 
cular, and possessing the greatest endurance. 

The points of the Pereheron may be stated as follows : 

The head is short; the brow is broad, and has that hollow of profile be- 
tween the eyes and nostrils sometimes known as the dish-face ; but the- 
head in general is not heavier than seems in keeping with the general 
massiveness of the frame ; the neck is long, well-arched and heavy, but r 
like the head, not disproportioned to the general bulk. The back is short ; 
they are well ribbed up and round barrelled ; their legs are particularly 
short from the knees and hocks downward ; they are heavily haired, but 
have not such shaggy fetlocks and feet a.s this would seem to indicate ; 
their sinews are iron-like; and their feet are hard, sound, apparently in- 
sensible to disease. In height, they are from fourteen and a half to fif- 
teen and a half hands, the latter being rather more than the average. Gray 
is the characteristic, almost the only, colour. 

For hard work on ordinary fare the Percheron is unequalled ; and his 
energy and endurance are wonderful. He will keep his condition where 
another horse would die of hard labour and neglect. Though full of spirit, 
unflinching under even painful effort, he is yet docile. 

The Canadian Horse. This horse, when pure, is entitled to be consid- 
ered distinct. He can lay no claim, of course, to being regarded as the 
natural horse, no more than the Norman, Percheron or the English thor- 

O 

ough-bred ; but his characteristics are so marked as to render him worthy 
of being classed separately and noticed with some minuteness. 

He is supposed to be descended from the Norman-French horse, brought 
over by the pioneers of Canada ; but how crossed (though he is evident! v 
the result of a cross), it is impossible to say. In some particulars, he so 
much resembles the old horse of Normandy as to seem the unmistakable 
descendant of that stock ; whereas in others he is so unlike him as to in- 
dicate that the cross must have been with a very strongly marked animal, 
of great powers of transmission. 



<F,OG THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The distinguishing characteristics may be stated as follows : The aver- 
age height is about fourteen hands ; the body is solid, compactly put to- 
gether, but somewhat inclined to flatness of side ; the head is rather large 
for a horse of the height stated, but it is well formed and lean, so that it 
<loes not appear out of proportion and cumbersome; the forehead is broad : 
the ears are wide apart, and carried well up ; the eye is small and clear, 
and has a bold expression ; the chest is broad and full ; the shoulder is 
strong, but inclining to be straight and rather low and heavy at the 
withers ; the loins are fine ; the croup round and fleshy ; the thighs mus- 
cular ; the legs comparatively heavy and joints pretty large, but the bones 
are flat, and no race of horses has sounder and more powerful limbs ; and 
none can equal the Canadian as to feet these being tough, hard, iron- 
like, and free from disease, even under the most unfavourable circum- 
stances. This seems to be one of the most valuable characteristics of body. 
Bad handling, awkward shoeing, hard travel nothing in the bounds of 
reason seems to affect his feet. Diseases of this part are almost absolutely 
unknown. 

The mane and tail are peculiar, being very heavy, and in almost all 
cases, wavy. The back sinews are shaggy-coated, nearly to the knee, and 
the fetlocks are long. 

The prevailing colour is black ; but browns and chestnuts are frequent- 
ly found ; sometimes sorrels and duns, having manes and tails lighter 
than the body. Occasionally there may be found a dark iron-gray, with 
black legs. 

Canadians are long-lived, easily-kept, and capable of the greatest endur- 
ance. They are heavy enough for the purposes of the farmer ; and as 
roadsters, while they are not to be regarded as rapid travellers, they 
maintain a reasonable rate of speed, say six miles an hour, for long jour- 
neys and continuously, and this while carrying a heavy weight ; it is 
nothing uncommon for them to do fifty miles a day for many days in 
succession. 

BREEDS OF POULTKY. 

Within the last few years the number of so-called distinct varieties of 
fowls has been largely increased. Whether the breeds are originally dis- 
tinct may be doubted. Not above five or six can be relied on to breed 
all their chickens like themselves. For practical purposes fowls may be 
treated as if there were but few kinds, for almost all require the same 
treatment. It may be convenient to group all the kinds at present culti- 
vated under two headings. 



BREEDS OF POULTKV. 

The two groups niu.st be described as, first, of fowls which immediately 
o" or incubate after having ] a id a certain number of eggs ; and second 
of those which will generally continue laying, throughout the late spring 
ami early summer months, without even wishing to set ; i. e. we may call 
m "setters," and "non-setters." Among the first the group of 
ers these further distinctions must be taken. They are either cleau- 
,'ed or feather-legged fowls. Of the former (the clean-legged) the best 
known varieties are the Dorking or Sussex fowl, under which title must 
be included all the five-toed fowls of all colours, and also the cuckoo, the 
tch-grey, and the ordinary barndoor fowl. These are amono- the best 
for providing chickens for market. The game-breeds (with which must be 
reckoned the Malay) are steady setters, and the best of mothers. All the 
feather-legged fowls set In this group are included the different shades 
of colour assigned to what are known as Cochin Chinas, with the grey 
birds called Brahmas, and the black called Langshans. The special merit 
of these feather- legged breeds is their tameness and their habit of winter 
laying : in order to which the earliest pullets of the spring must be retain- 
ed which will begin laj-ing as early as the end of October. They also 
better than any others endure confinement within narrow limits. Then 
turning to those varieties which do not set on their eggs, the second group 
must be divided into single and rose-combed varieties. Of the former, the 
best known kinds are the black Spanish, blue Andalusian, black Minorca, 
and brown and white Leghorn. Under this head, also, come the crested 
varieties (under which must be included the Polish, the Houdan, and 
other French kinds). In this second group must be considered the whole 
of the varieties, whether pencilled or spangled, which are called Ham- 
burgs, Chittaprats, or Dutch every day layers. Both single and rose-comb- 
ed breeds furnish a large supply of eggs in summer ; but the rose-combed 
are very impatient of confinement. The crested fowls are placed in this 
group because, though they occasionally become "broody" or desirous of 
srtting, yet they are not often to be trusted either to hatch eggs or to rear 
chickens which have been hatched in other ways. 

Now as regards their treatment it matters little to which of these varie- 
ties the fowls we propose to keep may belong ; for all alike need a certain 
degree of freedom, and a free exposure to sun, to be at all productive, es- 
pecially in winter. Only people of experience can keep fowls healthy in 
confinement. The most experienced can hardly keep them confined long. 
Young fowls, i. e. the early pullets of the year, lay the largest quantity of 
winter eggs ; but no fowls, young or old, can be expected to reach the 
standard of high health, at which laying begins, unless they be well fed

with a large variety of food. It is comparatively easy to fatten a fowl in 
a few weeks ; but to preserve one in constant high condition, so as to en- 
able it to lay regularly, good meals, from the owner's hands, are requisite ; 
with tit-bits picked up for itself upon the yard or road-side hedges. It 
is a mistake to suppo.se that the hens do best which have a neat garden or 
trim compartment to run on. Fowls and untidiness go well together. An 
open common or highway where cattle have been which, with their 
droppings, attract flies is better range for fowls than is the neatest flower 
bed ; whilst rough shrubs to give shade, or shelter insects, are very des- 
irable. Given these i. e., a rough place to run about in then the task 
of the poultry keeper will be comparatively easy ; for his main duties will 
be discharged by the birds themselves.

Stock. 




HE rearing and fattening of stock are the highest develop- 
ments of agriculture. The conversion of the mineral 
matter of the soil and the treasures of the air into sale- 
able crops is the first step. The conversion of vegetable 
matter into flesh is the final process, after which flesh is 
returned again to the domain of earth and air. 

The average percentage composition of the foods com- 
monly given to farm animals is shown in the following

The composition of all vegetable foods is liable to variation, depending 
on the state of maturity of the plant, and the character of the soil and 
In the case of perfectly matured produce, as, for instance, ripe 
seed, the variations in composition are not generally considerable, and an 
average composition, such as is given in the table, will be found in most 
cases pretty correct. But in the case of immature produce, such as mea- 
dow grass, turnips, or mangels, the composition largely depends on the 
stage of growth in which the plant is taken, and is also greatly affected 
by the character of the manuring. It may be generally stated thafas a 
plant matures the proportion of water, nitrogenous mattered ash consti- 
tuents diminishes, while the proportion of carbo-hydrates largely increases. 
At the same time the amides become more or less converted into albumi- 
noids. 

While fodder crops deteriorate towards maturity, from the conversion 
F soluble carbo-hydrates into fibre, crops such as potatoes and mangel 
improve, the carbo-hydrates produced in their case being respectively 
starch and sugar, both of them substances of great feeding value. 

MM 



610 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

The influence of high manuring is naturally to increase the luxuriance 
of a crop ; a luxuriant crop will always contain more water than one in 
less active growth. Very large mangels often contain only 6 per cent, of 
dry matter, while in quite small roots the proportion may be as high as 15 
per cent. Luxuriance also retards maturity. A heavily manured mangel 
will contain, at the same date, a much smaller proportion of sugar than a 
similar mangel grown on poor soil. The result of high manuring is thus 
not only to increase the bulk of the crop, but also generally to diminish 
the proportion of carbo-hydrates, and increase the nitrogen, ash constitu- 
ents, and water. In highly manured crops a smaller proportion of the 
nitrogen will exist as albuminoids than in crops less heavily manured and 
more mature. 

An important element in the character of a food is the proportion be- 
tween its nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous constituents, these two classes 
of ingredients performing to a considerable extent distinct functions in 
the body. To find this proportion it is usual to calculate the fat into its 
equivalent in starch (generally done by multiplying the fat by 244), and 
add the product to the other carbo-hydrates of the food ; the relation of the 
albuminoids to the total non-nitrogenous constituents reckoned as carbo- 
hydrates is then easily found. The relation in question is commonly 
known as the " nutritive relation " of the food (Nahrstoffverhaltniss), but 
is better described as the " albuminoid ratio." Thus the composition of 
wheat grain in the table shows an "albuminoid ratio" of 1:66, and the 
composition of decorticated cotton cake an albuminoid ratio of 1:15. 
Figures so calculated are, however, only approximate, as we ought clearly 
only to take account of the constituent actually digested by the animal. 
A little consideration will show that it is impossible to affix a definite 
feeding value to any food, as its practical effect must depend in great 
measure on the conditions under which it is employed ; more especially 
on the kind of animal consuming it, and the general character of the diet 
of which it forms a part. Thus, the value of a bulky food, as hay or 
straw, is far greater when given to a ruminant animal, than when con- 
sumed by a horse or pig. Concentrated, easily digestible foods, as corn 
and oilcake, have clearly a value above their composition when added to 
a poor and bulky food, as straw chaff, or to a watery food like turnips, 
because they are the means of raising the diet to a point at which the 
animal will thrive. On the other hand, roots and green fodder, even 
when watery and poor in composition, may have a considerable effect 
when added in moderate proportion to dry food. The highest value 
is, in short, only obtained from food when it is skilfully employed. 



THE FOOD AND FATTENING OF LIVE STOCK. 

There is, also, a condition which we can never hope to express by fig- 
ures, but which has a considerable influence on the effect of any diet ; 
this is flavour. An agreeable flavour stimulates appetite, and probably 
promotes digestion. This part of the question belongs, rather to practice 
than science. 

Our knowledge of the precise functions performed by the constituents 
of food must still be regarded as unsettled. The terms fit formers, heat 
producers, and force producers were, until very recently, indiscriminately 
applied to the carbo-hydrates, starch, sugar, and fat. Recently the views 
of many leading physiologists have been altered, and, -while fats and oils 
are still regarded as producers of fat, starch and sugar are looked upon 
more exclusively as maintainers of the animal heat and producers of vital 
force. This view, it will be observed, does not detract from the nutrient 
value of these substances, because animal heat and force would, but for 
their presence, require to be supplied from the fats and albuminoids of the 
food. The albuminoids have also recently been regarded as probable 
sources of fat. They, like the carbo-hydrates, contain the elements of fat 
in the form of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and, by their decomposition 
in the animal system, they may become sources of fat, as well as of highly 
nitrogenised products available for other purposes. 

The character of the fattening process has been more thoroughly stud- 
ied than the nutrition of young and growing ^limals. 

For the body to increase in weight it is clear that the food supplied 
must be in excess of the quantity demanded for mere renovation of tissue 
and for the production of heat and work. When such an excess of food is 
given, a part of the albuminoids and ash constituents is generally con- 
verted into new tissue, while a part of the fat, carbo-hydrates, and albu- 
minoids is stored up in the form of fat. 

As only the excess of the food is converted into increase, liberal feeding 
is, within certain limits, the most economical. If a lamb can be brought 
by liberal treatment to 1 50 Ib. live weight at one year old, the amount of 
food consumed will be far smaller than if two years are occupied in at- 
taining the same weight, for the food required for animal heat and work 
daring the second year is clearly saved. 

The three animals with which the farmer is chiefly concerned have 
very different powers of consuming food, and yield different rates of in- 
crease, Lawes and Gilbert reckon that, on an average of the whole fat- 
tening period, an ox will produce 100 Ibs. of live weight from the con- 
sumption of 250 Ibs. oil cake, b'OO Ibs. clover hay, and 3500 Ibs. swedes. 

Sheep will produce the same increase by the consumption of 250 Ibs. oil- 





(J12 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

cake, 300 Ibs. clover hay, and 400 Ibs. swedes. Pigs will require about 
500 Ibs. of barley meal to yield a similar result. 

If we draw our conclusions from the composition of diets of acknow- 
ledged good quality, and regard solely the true albuminoids present we 
shall find that a diet having an albuminoid ratio of 1 : 9 10 is 
very suitable for fattening oxen; a diet of 1:89 will give good re- 
sults with sheep, and one of 1 : 7 with pigs. Diets more nitrogenous may, 
however, be employed with more or less advantage. 

SOME FACTS TO GUIDE THE GEOWER OF BEEF. 

Any branch of science that is intimately related to the more prominent 
necessaries of human life must be the most interesting of all sciences. The 
beauties of study in Astronomy and Geology cannot, for example, compare 
in intrinsic value with Animal Physiology and Chemistry as taught 
through the upbuilding of a fattening steer and of a bushel of wheat; yet 
the discoverer of a planet or of a new compound secures the world's ap- 
plause as against the producer of improved food for man. That this will 
always be so is not evident, because, I think, as the world becomes more 
practical, it will also become more honest in distribution of favours that 
bear upon the every-day comforts of its people. Excuse the temptation 
thus given to record in oyr history, as Experimentalists, how much we 
rejoice with Europe in the high honour just accorded to the late J. ] 
Lawes now Sir J. B. Lawes, Bart, of Rothamstead, England England's 
first man in the science and practice of what has largely made her a na- 
tion Agriculture. 

It is already a certain thing that the leaders of all classes are becoming 
more practical in regard to the life of the millions of every country ; in 
fact, land and its productions are not only the absorbing questions, but 
are at the root of a revolution that will ring the earth in another ten 
years. In calling the attention of Ontario farmers to this phase of rural 
economy, I do so with the view of obtaining for that branch of it called 
" Live Stock" such a measure of scientific recognition as its importance 
justifies. I do not complain that science has taken no notice of beef, 
mutton and wool, in other countries, but I do complain that the great Ra- 
tional bodies of scientific men on this continent have not formally admit- 
ted farmers as co-partners in their annual deliberations. I shall apologize 
if I am in the wrong in this, as I may have overlooked some recent work ; 
but I cannot withhold complaint, if, on the other hand, no place, for ex- 
ample, has been, or will be, allowed the scientific and practical agricul-

turist, nor any encouragement given, is to be given to him in the prose- 
cution of his studies, at the forthcoming meeting of the American 
Association for the advancement of science, at Montreal. 

The enterprising farmer of these days is not satisfied with a knowledge 
of the principles of the sciences that are intimately related to his profes- 
sion, the principal application of some of which he can even venture upon 
himself but he requires that the pure scientist guide him through all the 
daily and yearly history of every field and animal of his farm, in order to 
the greatest amount of the most valuable produce, in the shortest time, at 
. the least cost.. 

THE PURPOSE OF CATTLE FATTENING. 

1. Is to obtain the largest quantity of the best quality of beef, at the 
least cost, under three years of age. 

2. To aim at breeding, raising, and fattening one cattle beast from 
every ten cultivated acres of the Province. 

3. To grow all the food required for these purposes within ourselves. 

4. The animals to weigh alive not less than 1,500 pounds each. 

5. The net cost of production, giving credit for manure, not to exceed 
five cents per pound, live weight 

6. To obtain one ton of manure per month, from each cattle beast over 
two years old, when stabled to finish the fattening process. 

7. The value of such manure, under the best management, to be made 
worth 82.50 per ton. 

THE ANIMAL IN CATTLE FATTENING. 

In any class it is' desirable to have, 

8. Purity of sire ; 

9. A certain age and sex ; 

10. A quiet disposition; 

1 1. Quality, as indicated by fine head and ears, fine bone, horn, tail, and 
a medium thick skin, having plenty of fine, soft silky hair, with mellow- 
ness ; 

12. A weight-carrying frame ; 

13. Such a breed as will mature, or premature, from two to three years 
of age ; 

14. Having the character of doing best upon Ontario pastures ; 

15. Giving the best quality of flesh, with least offal ; 

16. Sure breeders and good nurses ; 



(514 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

17. The Shorthorn grade is best for weight, early maturity and stall 

feeding. 

18. The Hereford Grade is best for hardiness, and grazing disposition ; 

19. The Aberdeen Poll Grade is best for an even average of all re- 
quirements ; 

20. The Galloway Grade is best for extreme hardiness and quality of 

flesh; 

21. The Devon Grade is best for good nursing and sure breeding. 

THE FOOD OF FATTENING CATTLE. 



Its use is to, 

22. Keep up animal heat or life ; 

23. Repair the waste ; 

24. Increase growth ; . 

25. Produce flesh and fat. 

Its value is affected by, 

26. The particular breed ; 

27. Age of the animal ; 

28. Individual character ; 

29. Conditions of life such as temperature ; 

30. Management. 

31. In growing our own cattle food, the first question should be : How 
much beef can we get per acre ? the second, How much manure are we 
able to return ? 

32. The amount of increase that may be calculated upon as the produce 
of certain quantities and kinds of food, depends upon paragraphs 8 to 

30. 

33. Chemically, we can calculate upon getting one pound of flesh from 
any food that has ten parts of dry substances in its composition : thus, 
100 pounds of swede turnips, having as much as ninety parts of water, 
will only give one pound of flesh, while 100 pounds of corn, having only 
thirteen parts of water, will give ten pounds of flesh. 

34. Practically, foods give results according to their chemical analysis, 
when combined, or mixed, to suit the particular animal system. 

35. For example, a mixture of corn, pease and oats, will give better re- 
sults than corn alone, although seven per cent, lower in nutritive pro- 
perties. 

36. Never forget the difference between " life " food and " fattening " 
food ; starch and sugar keep up heat and life, and unless they are supplied, 



SOME FACTS TO GUIDE THE GROWER OF BEEF. 615 

along with fats and oils, the fattening process will be slower, because heat 
and life would have to be supplied from the fats and oils ; if given in ex- 
cess, starch and sugar will produce fat on animals. 

37. A young animal, building its bone and muscle, requires different 
kinds and quantities of food from the more mature one. Hay, straw, and 
other fodders are best for the immature animal ; they are also heat and 
fat makers, and would fatten alone, though slowly. 

38. Rapid growth and much fat are opposed to each other ; so, to grow 
carcass and also fatten early, requires bone-forming and fat-forming ma- 
terials they must go together. 

39. A maturing animal cattle two to three years old having built the 
most of its frame, requires less fodders, and more flesh and fat formers. 
Grain in many forms is therefore best for finishing fattening cattle. 

40. From birth to the time a cattle beast is ripe, the daily rate of in- 
crease on an average should not be less than one and one-half pound, 
thus, a three-year-old should weigh 1,600 pounds ; a two and one-half- 
year-old, 1,360 ; and a two year-old, 1,100 pounds, alive. 

41. But, in fact, the daily rate of increase is more up to two years, than 
at any time afterwards. A two-year-old, well done to, will weigh 1,400, 
and if carried on to three years will not scale less than 1,800 pounds. This 
may be called pre-maturing. 

42. Very much then of the success of obtaining big weights in a short 
time, lies in a knowledge of individual character, and the proper propor- 
tions and kinds of food. 

43. The best kind of permanent pasture a mixture of certain grasses 
and clovers under favourable conditions, will give a greater daily in- 
crease than any other form of food. 

44. A two-year-old cattle beast, put to such pasture on loth May, when 
it weighs 1,100 pounds, will stand 1,400 on 1st October following. The 
addition of grain under such circumstances does not add correspondingly 
to weight, though it does so on comparatively poor pasture. 

45. Proper shelter and water on pasture means forty per cent, of the 
increase. 

46. Where no first-class permanent pasture is kept, it is desirable to pro- 
vide for short commons by having a regular supply of green fodders ; feed 
these either upon the fields or by " soiling." 

47. Soiling fattening cattle in Ontario implies the production of one 
animal per acre, in place of three acres of ordinary pasture maintaining 
one ; the principal soiling crops are corn, lucerne, red clover, tares and 
oats, rye and rape. 



616 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

48. When it is desired to prepare for exhibitions, or for extra condition 
at Christmas, soiling, in a loose box all summer, in addition to grain, can- 
not be surpassed by any other form of feeding. 

49. Straw cut and slightly fermented is one-fourth more valuable for 
fattening. 

50. Green oat-straw and pea-straw together are about equal in value 
to hay. 

51. Thirty-five pounds swede turnips, six pounds clover hay, and two 
and one-half pounds oil-cake will produce one pound of beef. 

52. One ton of fermented cut straw and two hundred pounds oil-cake 
is equal to one ton of hay. 

53. Six pounds hay, one pound bran, twenty pounds turnips, and five 
pounds corn-meal will add one pound to the weight of a good two-year-old 
steer. 

54. Six pounds hay, one pound bran, twenty pounds turnips, and six 
pounds pea-meal will do the same thing. 

55. The like quantities of hay, bran, turnips, and seven and a half pounds 
crushed oats will do the same thing. 

56. Corn, pease, oats and barley will pay to fatten cattle when not over 
one cent per pound in the market. 

57. Barley -meal gives a fine finish, and sleek, mellow handling. 

58. In soiling, green fodder is safer when cut and mixed with straw or 
hay, allowed to slightly ferment and sprinkled with meal. 

59. It is still an unsettled question whether cooked food or raw food is 
best for cattle-fattening. 

60. All animals fatten cheaper and faster on prepared raw food, as 
against whole or uncut hay and roots. 

61. Every animal that chews the cud must have bulk ; it is not enough 
to have sufficient nutritive value in small quantities, the stomach must 
be filled to give material for ruminating. 

62. Most foods are better in combination than alone. 

63. Combine so as to have little or no waste. 

64. Fat-producing and flesh-producing food together will give sixty per 
cent, more increase than when given singly. 

65. For young cattle give 1 of flesh to 8 of heat-producing substances, 
and to older ones give 1 to six. 

66. Most food of young cattle goes to make up bone and muscle, leav- 
ing third-class manure. 

67. Most food of half -grown animals goes to make flesh, leaving second- 
class manure. 



MISCELLANEOUS AGRICULTURAL SUBJECTS. 617 

68. Most food of mature animals goes to make fat and support life, 
the excess becoming first-class manure. 

69. Exclusive of water chemically, animals coming to maturity will eat 
about one-fiftieth of their own weight per day.

2. There are as many suitable plants in the uncultivated clearances of 
the country as would replant every cultivated acre of the old Provinces. 

3. Do not grudge a piece of cultivated land for tree planting the gain 
will be more than a grain crop, and in any case you can seed down to hay

distances apart not from a close body of branchless stems. 

6. Ornament is secured only by allowing every tree room to grow in 
accordance with its individual character never by crowding. 

7. To assist in regulating rain-fall and temperature suitable to the wants 
of the country, we must have a national policy based upon scientific and 
practical facts in past arboricultural history. 

8. Never plant trees upon naturally wet ground (our heaviest swamp 
sorts so called are upon comparatively dry spots). 

9. Our native trees require no manuring, trenching, or breaking up of 
the surface, in preparation for replanting. 

10. Spring planting is generally more successful than in the fall. 

11. Choose mild, calm weather, between 1st April and 1st June. 



618 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

12. Select plants from the clearings or unshaded openings in the bush, 
never from under older ones, and as much as possible from soil and ex- 
posure of a similar character to that to which they are to be removed. 

13. Hardwood trees are safer to transplant than the pine and spruce. 

14. The best sorts are maple, birch, beech, ironwood, ash, elm, butter- 
nut, oak, and hickory, with pine, spruce, and hemlock to intermix. 

15. To save time and insure better success, remove the plants from the 
bush, or the public nursery, in October, and trench them close together, 
but separately, in dry soil, covering them firmly with earth. 

16. Before trenching, cut off any over-length}' rough root, and branch, 
but take care of the small fibres and the top leader. 

17. Avoid tall branchless trees that have been growing close together 
a two or three feet one will do better than one ten or twelve feet in 
length. 

18. In removing from the bush, dig all round before lifting ; do not 
pull much nor shake off all the earth. 

19. Never forget that drought is more dangerous than a little frost. 

20. Two men in one day will dig up, waggon home, and trench in the 
garden nursery, as many as 300 plants from your own bush. 

21. Choose calm, cloudy weather, when the soil is moist, but not wet, 
for planting from the nursery. 

22. Make the pits one-half wider and deeper than the roots require, 
and never plant deeper than one inch over the old mark on the stem. 

23. Do not plant while water is in the pit. 

24. If for a belt or clump to shelter, plant not farther apart than seven 
feet in any direction. 

25. The object of plan ting 1 so close as seven feet (900 per acre) is to 
afford individual shelter, mutual support in several physiological relations, 
give plenty allowance for failures, and to thin out as required for purposes 
of profit and individual necessities of trees. 

26. Two men should pit and plant 150 trees per day. 

27. Spread out all fibrous roots in the pit, fill in the top or best loamy 
soil first, shaking the plant and gently pulling it up a little, when fully 
half the earth is in, tramp firmly with the foot, and finish up with the re- 
mainder of earth. 

28. Use a variety of trees, not one or two species only, as the success 
will be more certain. 

29. During the first season examine after high winds, and toe any 
openings round the plants. 



MISCELLANEOUS AGRICULTURAL SUBJECTS. 619 

30. Run no risks from animals, or breaking by snow drifts, and allow 
no saplings or growths from the old stumps to interfere with those 
planted. 

31. Sheep may be admitted to graze after ten years, no cattle for 
twenty. 

32. The second year is the trying one ; you may have buds and leaves 
the first year, and a dead plant the second, if good the third year, con- 
gratulate. 

33. Make good any deaths for the first three years, not afterwards. 

34. Always have a few hundred plants ready in your garden nursery. 

35. Never burn the grass among your trees, but use the scythe when 
too rank. 

36. Never allow the drying of clothes on the young plants. 

37. Do not prune the pine, spruce, or any of the resinous sorts. 

38. Thin out the least valuable sorts, or those you do not wish to retain 
permanently, whenever they begin to interfere six inches into the branch- 
es of each other. 

39. It is no over-calculation to say that where the influence of trees is 
needed, the gain, after fifteen years, will amount annually to $200 over a 
hundred acre farm. 

40. If you plant at 1 2 or 1 5 feet apart you will be ten years behind 
those at seven feet, when each are 25 years old. 

41. We do not deserve well of our country if we cannot establish trees 
at a cost not to exceed 5 cents each. 

42. The cost of planting one acre, irrespective of fencing, which will 
depend upon form and any advantages from local causes will be about : 

Lifting and trenching 900 plants in October $10 00 

OpeningOOO pits 1700 

Planting 8 00 



S35 00 
Keeping for three years 10 00 



$45 00 

* 

43 If you purchase from public nurseries, the cost will be about $100 
more. 

44. Get your Township Council to petition Government to institute a 
regular system of re-planting by statutory enactments.

G20 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 



AGE OF FARM LIVE STOCK. 

We add here a paragraph descriptive of the dentition of farm-stock as 
indicative of age. The teeth of our domesticated animals vary in size, 
form, character and number, in accordance with the nature of the food on 
which they live, and also in accordance with the peculiar organization and 
habits of life of the animals themselves. They are also capable of being 
materially influenced in their development by the system under which 
stock are reared. In highly bred and liberally fed animals the teeth are 
produced earlier than in those living under the reverse conditions. It is 
therefore necessary to take this point into consideration in determining 
the question of age. Teeth are divided into three classes, viz.: molars or 
grinding teeth, incisors or cutting teeth, and canines or tushes. All our 
domesticated animals possess the two former, but not in equal numbers. 
The ox and sheep have no incisors in the upper jaw, neither have they 
any canine teeth or tushes. Besides the three varieties mentioned, the pig 
has also a small tooth in each jaw situated between the corner incisor 
tooth and the first molar; this is termed the premolar. Each animal has 
two sets of teeth during life : the first are termed the milk or sucking 
teeth, also known as 'temporary or deciduous, in consequence of their being 
shed or cast off; the second set, by which they are replaced, are known as 
the permanent or adult teeth. The teeth appear in the mouth with tol- 
erable regularity and in a certain definite order, so that they afford a fairly 
reliable indication of the age of stock up to the time when dentition is 
completed. The temporary teeth differ from the permanent in size, form 
and character, and are readily distinguished from each other after a little 
careful study. The molar teeth are distinguished numerically, counting 
from front to back, viz. : first, second, third, and so on. The incisors of 
the horse and pig are six in number in each jaw ; the two middle ones are 
termed centrals, the next pair laterals, and the outermost corners? 
In the ox and sheep there are eight cutting teeth. Those next the cen- 
trals are spoken of as lateral centrals, and the other two pairs as in the 
horse and pig. 

The following table shows the order of succession in which the changes 
take place in the horse, ox, pig and sheep.

From a consideration of the above tables, it will be seen that at ten 
months old there are present in the horse's mouth six temporary incisors, 
and the first, second, and third temporary molars. At one year and nine 
months the fourth and fifth permanent molars have appeared, and a year 
later the first temporary molar is changed and the two central incisors 
are permanent. At three years and six months old the second and third 
temporary molars have been replaced by permanent ones, and the two 
lateral incisors are also permanent. At four years and a half old the 
the temporary corner teeth are shed and the last molar and tusks are up, 
so that at this time dentition is fairly completed.

sixth permanent molars are present, and the two central incisors are 
changed. At two years and a half old the first and second molars are 
cast, and the lateral central incisors are permanent. At three years and 
three months all the temporary teeth are shed, and have been replaced by 
permanent, ones.

In the sheep, as in the ox, all the temporary incisors are up at one 
month old, as well as the first, second, and third molars. At one year 
the two central incisors are changed and replaced by permanent teeth, 
and the fourth and fifth molars are up. Six months later the two lateral 
central and the sixth molar appear. At two years and three months the 
lateral permanent incisors are cut, and the first, second, and third molars 
are permanent. At three years old the corner incisors are shed, and 
shortly afterwards all the permanent teeth are in the mouth,

The pig acquires a full mouth of incisor teeth at about three months 
old, some time previous to which three molars have appeared in each jaw 
viz., the first, second, and third. At six months the premolars and the 
fourth permanent molar appear ; in nine months the tusks and fifth per- 
manent molar are changed. Three months later the first, second, and 
third temporary molars are shed and replaced by permanent ones. At 
eighteen months the sixth or last molar and the lateral incisor are cast, 
and the changes at this time are complete.

FULL DIRECTIONS FOR CLOSING EACH AND EVERY ACCOUNT IN THB 
LEDGER AT THE END OF THE YEAR ; ALSO WITH EXPLA- 
NATION so COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE 

THAT NO ONE CAN FAIL TO ACQUIRE, IN 
A SHORT TIME, A THOROUGH 

KNOWLEDGE OF Ac- 
OOUHTB. 



1. Book-keeping is the science of recording business transactions in a 
systematic manner. 

2. Book-keeping is of two kinds Single Entry and Double Entry. 

. In Single Kntry \ve make an entry only when a personal account is 
affected, at which time we simply charge or credit the person making an 
entry to only one account hence, single entry. 

4. A personal account is an account with a person, firm or corporation. 

5. An account is a collection of items under one heading in the Ledger. 

6. In Double Entry we make an entry for every business transaction, 
making an entry to two or more accounts, according to the number of 

accounts affected by the transaction. Every time we debit an account for 
a certain amount, we credit some other account for the same amount, 
hence, double entry. 

7. A business transaction is an exchange of vain 

. BOOKS USED. There are two kinds of books used in Book-keeping 
Principal and Auxiliary or Aid Books. 

9. Principal Books are those we post from and use as original books of 
entry. The Ledger is also a principal book. 

10. By posting is meant, to transfer entries from any book to the Ledger. 
The books from which we usually post are: Journal (or Day Book), Cash 
Book, and sometimes Sales Book and Invoice Book. 

11. An original book of entry is one upon which the business transac- 
tion is first recorded. The books used principally as original books of en- 
try are : Blotter, Journal (or Day Book), Cash Book and Sales Book. 



g28 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

THE PEINCIPAL BOOKS. 

12 THE JOURNAL. Business men have abandoned the use of the inter- 
mediate book called the Journal, and have consolidated it with the Day 
Book. In the Business College style of book-keeping, merchants enter 
the business transactions first in the Day-Book and then journalize them 
by arranging the debits and credits on the Journal, after which they post 
from the Journal to the Ledger. The business man of to-day can find no 
use for this unnecessary book, the Journal ; it is therefore cast aside, and 
the posting is done directly from the Day-Book to the Ledger. The Dny 
Book is used as a detailed record of our business transactions. Having 
consolidated the two books (Day-Book and Journal), it is essential, in or- 
der to have the book complete, that it should partake of the style of both ; 
therefore, when we record a business transaction, we first make the Jour- 
nal entry' then write the explanations in as few words as possible, either 
under or on the same line with the entry. This book may be called either 
a Day Book or a Journal, but custom having made the title " Journal " 
preferable, it will be used hereafter instead of " Day-Book." 

The Journal should have two extra columns one for " Merchandise 
Debit," and one for " Merchandise Credit," which renders it unnecessary to 
post the merchandise oftener than once a month crediting Merchandise 
account in the Ledger at the end of the month for the total sales on ac- 
count, as shown by the Merchandise Credit column, and debiting it for the 
total merchandise purchases on account, as shown by the Merchandise 
Debit column. (See 342 and 347.) The left-hand column is the Debit 
and the right-hand column the Credit. 

13. THE CASH BOOK. The Cash Book is a book used as a detailed re- 
cord of all cash transactions. Upon the left-hand or Debit side, is record- 
ed all cash received ; and on the right-hand or Credit side, all cash paid 
out, the difference in the sums total of the two sides showing, at any 
time, the exact amount of cash on hand. This book should always be used 
as a book of original entry ; and posting done directly therefrom to the 
Ledger, as it is wholly unnecessary work and a waste of time to transfer 
the entries to a Journal before posting. There is no business in which the 
books can not be correctly kept by posting directly from the Cash Book 
to the Ledger. In making entries in this book, sufficient explanation 
should accompany the entries to make them plain. Of course, many en- 
tries require no explanation ; for instance, if a person pays us on account, 
we simply enter his name and the amount on the debit side of the Cash 



THE riUXCIPAh BOOK-!. G29 

Book. When notes are paid, the name of the makers, date, time, etc., 
should be entered. All items on the Debit side of the Cash Book should 
be credited in the several accounts to which they belong in the Ledger, 
because (.'ash is debited; and all items on the Credit side of the Cash 
Book must be debited to the .several accounts to which they belong on the 
Ledger, because Cash is credited. It is unnecessary to keep a Cash ac- 
count in the Ledger ; but, instead, enter in the trial balance, when it is 
taken, the balance of cash on hand, as shown by the Cash Book, which 
result proves the same as though such an account were kept. 

14. THE SALES BOOK. The Sales Book is a book in which the mer- 
chandise sales are recorded. It is used principally in the larger establish- 
ments, as in the smaller houses the sales on account are all recorded in the 
Journal. 

Posting is sometimes dour dhvi-tly fnun this book to the Ledger; and 
sometimes the transactions are first transferred to the Journal before being 
posted. In posting directly from the Sales Books to the Ledger, the debits 
are posted to the personal accounts therein charged daily; and the total 
sales are carried forward until the end of the month, when the Merchan- 
dise account is credited in one entry from each Sales Book for the total 
sales for the month in each recorded. 

15. THE LEDGER. The Ledger is a book used to show the final sum- 
ming up of all our business transactions, and the standing of all personal 
and miscellaneous accounts. The left-hand side of the Ledger is always 
the Debit, and the right-hand side the Credit. 

16. When the Debit side of an account in the Ledger is the larger, the 
amount the Debit side exceeds the Credit is al \vays either a Resource or 
a 7,o>x. 

1 7. When the Credit side of an account in the Ledger is the larger, the 
amount the Credit side exceeds the Debit is always either a Liability or a 
Gain. 

The two preceding rules (16 and 17) are of the very greatest import- 
ance when we close our books at the end of the year, to find how much 
has been lost or gained ; for we then begin with the first account in the 
Ledger, and carry all accounts upon which we lose or gain to the Loss & 
Gain account ; therefore, unless we are familiar with these rules, we cannot 
so readily decide upon which accounts we lose or gain. The way we de- 
cide upon which accounts we lose or gain is as follows : 

18. Debit. When we look at an account in the Ledger, the Debit side 
of which is the larger, we first decide whether or not it is a Resource. If 
it be anything <>/ >:<i.lue belonging to us, or any note or personal account 



G30 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

owing tons, it is a Resource ; if not, it must be a Loss, since all accounts 
on the Debit side of the Ledger must be either Resources or Losses. If 
the account be a Resource, we pass it by and do nothing with it ; if a Loss, 
we balance the account and carry the Loss to the Debit side of Loss & Gain 
account. 

111. Credit. On the other hand, when we look at an account in the 
Ledger, the Credit side of which is the larger, we first decide whether or 
not it is a Liability. If it be any note or personal account we owe, it is a 
Liability ; if not, it must be a Gain, since all accounts on the Credit side 
of the Ledger must be either Liabilities or Gains. If the account be a 
Liability, we pass it by and do nothing with it ; if a Gain, we balance the 
account and carry the Gain to the Credit side of the Loss fc Gain account. 

RESOURCES. 

20. A Resource is anything of value belonging to us, such as : Cash. 
Merchandise, Store Fixtures, Real Estate, Notes made by other parties 
payable to us (Bills Receivable), etc., etc., or any personal account oiving 
to us. 

LIABILITIES. 

21. A Liability is any unpaid note made by us payable to other parties 
(Bills Payable), or any personal account we owe. 

THE AUXILIARY OR AID OF BOOKS. 

22. Auxiliary Books are used to classify business transactions ; they 
are also used as an aid to the principal books. 

23. THE BLOTTER. The Blotter is a book used merely as a memoran- 
dum book. Many persons improperly call the Day Book (or Journal) a 
Blotter. Business men wishing only one person's handwriting in the 
principal books, keep a book which they use when this person is absent 
from his post of duty, in which to make a memorandum of the transac- 
tions that occur during his absence, and when he returns they will be 
copied into the proper books. 

24. THE INVOICE BOOK. The Invoice Book is a book in which to file 
invoices or bills of goods we buy. It may have a single money column at 
the right margin of the page, in which to carry out the amount of each 
bill as it is pasted in the boe>k ; posting may be done directly from this 
book to the Ledger, each bill credited to the account to which it belongs, 
the total of the money column carried forsvard till the end of the month, 
and then posted to the Debit of the Merchandise account in one entry. How- 



Kl'LES FOR BOOK-KEEPIXG. 031 

ever, as the book is quite expensive, and as a great amount of time is re- 
quired in which to paste the invoices therein, the author would recommend 
the system suggested in paragraph No. 309. 

Jo. THE BILL BOOK, OR BILLS RECEIVABLE AND BILLS PAYABLE BOOK, 
is used as a memorandum book for Notes and Time Drafts (Acceptances), 
showing When they become due. 



A MISTAKE IN BOOK-KEEPING WILL NEVER BE MADE IF THE FOLLOWING RULES ARE 
AT ALL TIMES STRICTLY ADHERED TO. 

20. Firxf. Debit what we receive. ".Why?" Becau.se what we re- 
ceive costs us something of value. 

27. Second. Credit what we give. " Why ? " Because what we give 
produces us something of value. 

28. Third. For every amount entered to the Debit side of an account 
or accounts in the Ledger, enter a like amount to the credit side of some 
other account or accounts for the same amount.

In one side of the Corner Stone we will have cut in large letters the solitary motto 
SYSTEM ; in the other side we will have cut our Coat of Arms, interwoven in which 
will be found " Multum in parvo." This we call

4O. All items in the Miscellaneous 
Credit column are posted to the

When we have extra columns in the Journal, we post only the items found in the 
Miscellaneous Debit and Miscellaneous Credit columns during the month ; and at the 
end of the month we post the total amounts of the Mdse. Dr. and Mdse. Cr. columns 
to the Merchandise account. (See par. 12.) 



41. On the Debit side of the Ledger, 
we find nothing but 

RESOURCES AND LOSSES. 



THE LEDGER. 

42. On the Credit Side of the Ledger, 
we find nothing but 

LIABILITIES AND GAINS. 



When we first enter into business, and immediately after we have closed the books 
at the end of the year, there are no open accounts in the Ledger except those which 
are either Resources or Liabilities.

So when Cash is debited, all the accounts on that side of the book must be credited ; 
and when cash is credited, all accounts on that side of the book must be debited.

tween these lines. (See 801 to 805.) 

5th. Bring down on the credit side of this account, below the closing 
lines, in black ink, the difference as found in " 3rd " above, or the present 
worth of the partner, writing the date beginning of the new year, " By 
Present Worth," and the amount. 

56. EXPLANATION. "Stock" is a title used to represent the amount 
invested in the business. There are several methods of treating this 
account, among which are the following: 1st. To call the account 
" Stock," and credit it for the entire investment of the firm (regardless of 
how many members the firm may consist of), and debit it or credit it at 
the end of the year for the entire net loss or entire net gain of the firm, 
allowing the partnership contract to stipulate how much is by each mem- 
ber invested, and what proportion or percentage of the gain or loss each 
member is to share. 2. Some call the account " Capital," while others 
use the firm name instead : as, " J. H. Goodwin & Co.," treating it the 
same as " Stock," described in " 1st." 3. The most common and most 
practical method, however, is to open a separate Stock account for each 
member of the firm, and credit each for respective investment, as per 
system shown in this book. (See 49.) When there is but a single pro- 
prietor in the business, he may with propriety call the account " Stock," 
and treat it the same as described in 49.

ference between the two sides, and 
credit this account, in red ink, " By 
J. H. Goodwin, Stock account," for 
the amount lost on his private ac- 
count, and transfer that loss to the 
debit side of the J. H. Goodwin 
Stock account, in black ink. (See 
51.) 



64. Directions for closing the Private accounts at the end of each 
year : 

CLOSING No. 1. 1st. According to Closing No. 1, we bring over from 
the Loss and Gain account, at the end of the year, the net business loss 
or net business gain, as the case may be, crediting or debiting the Private 
account for such gain or loss. 

2nd. We then find the difference between the two sides of this account, 
and if the credit side be the larger, write on the debit side, in red ink, 
" To J. H. Goodwin, Stock account," and enter the amount in the debit 
column. 

3rd. Now rule the closing lines, and bring down the total amounts 
between the lines. 

4th. Now carry this difference (the net private gain) to the credit side 
of the " J. H. Goodwin, Stock account," in black ink. (See 52 and 55.) 



CSC 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 



5th. If, on the other hand, we find the debit side of this account to be 
the larger, we write on the credit side, in red ink, " By J. H. Goodwin, 
Stock account," ami enter the difference in the credit column : then rule 
the closing lines, and carry the difference (net private loss) to the " J. H. 
Goodwin Stock account," in black ink. (See 51.) 

CLOSING No. 2. According to closing No. 2, we do not bring over from 
the Loss and Gain account the net business loss or gain at the end of the 
year; but we simply find the difference between the two sides, and trans- 
fer that difference to the " J. H. Goodwin Stock account." We then pro- 
ceed to close the account the same as per instructions in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 
and 5th of Closing No. 1, above, except that the phrases "net private 
gain" and " net private loss," enclosed in parentheses in 4th and 5th, do 
not apply here ; for here it would be either a loss on private account or a 
credit !'>j y> /<>/// 



6i5. EXPLANATION. We open a Private account in the Ledger for each 
member of the firm, and treat it as per instructions above. It is the 
custom of some firms to allow the respective members each a salary, 
against which each for himself may draw for his personal use. When 
this is done they arc credited for the salary monthly or yearly, as they 
prefer ; and at the end of the year the account is closed the same as though 
no salary had been allowed, the business losses showing so much more on 
account of the increase in the "Salaries account," and the "Private 
account " of each showing so much more private gain ; so the business is 
not in the least affected by so doing.

'2nd. Now find the difference between the two sides of this account 
(Inventory included), and the amount the credit side exceeds the debit 
will be the gain on M<1*". ; .-il'tcr which, write on the debit side of this ac- 
count, in red ink, " To Loss ic Gain," for amount gained, which will now 
make the account balance. 

3rd. Rule the closing lines, and write the total amounts between the 
lines. 

4th. Write on the debit side of this account, below the clohi<i li m'*, in 
black ink, " To Inventory," and bring down the amount of Mdse. now on 
hand for the beginning of the new year. 

5th. Carry amount gained on Mdse. over to the Loss & Gain account,. 
writing on the credit side of that account, in black ink, " By Mdse.," for 
the amount gained. 

This concludes the closing of the Mdse. account. Now go back to the 
article " The End of the Year," and see what next to do. (See 289 and 
290.) 

72. EXPLANATION. The object of crediting this account at the end of 
the year " By Inventory," is simply to find how much we have gained on 
the merchandise sold during the year; for, after we have balanced the 
Mdse. account, we bring down on the debit side of this account the amount 
of the inventory for the commencement of the new year. Consequently, 
having credited this account " By Inventory," and debited it " To Inven- 
tory," for the same amount, the balance of the Ledger is not in the least 
affected ; and in transferring the gain on merchandise which was found on 
the credit side of the Mdse. account, to the same side (credit) of the " Loss 
& Gain account," the balance of the Ledger is not in the least afi'ected in 
the entire closing of the Mdse. account. We debit Mdse. for what it c 
a.--, and credit it for what we sell it for; hence, when we take an account 
of stock (find the value of the merchandise we have on hand) at the end 
of the year, and value it at what it would cost to lay it in the house at 
the time the Inventory is taken, we add the amount sold during the year 
(credit side of Merchandise account) to this amount on hand, and we find 
the amount the credit side exceeds the debit must be the amount for which 
we have sold the merchandise more than it cost us, or the net gain on sales. 
For example: If we buy 100 barrels of flour at $8 per barrel, we debit 
Merchandise for 8800. During the year we sell CO barrels at !?10 per 
barrel, and credit Merchandise for 600. At the end of the year we take 
an inventory or account of stock, and find that we have 40 barrels on 
hand, which we must value at what it would cost if we had to buy it 



638 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 



then. We will suppose that the price of flour has declined $1 per barrel, 
and we could therefore buy it at $7 per barrel. Our 40 barrels remaining 
unsold would then be worth only $280. This amount we add to the 
amount sold during the year ($600), which makes a total of $880. We 
now find the amount that this the credit side exceeds the debit, which 
gives $80, or our net gain on merchandise.

13. ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION. We debit Mdse. at commencement of 
business for the value of the merchandise then on hand, and we debit it 
during the year for all the merchandise we buy ; at the end of the year 
we ascertain how much of this merchandise we have on hand, valuino- it 

o 

at its present worth, or what it would cost to lay it in the store at this 
present time. We then find the difference between the value of the mer- 
chandise we now have on hand, and the total amount of the debit side of 
the Mdse. account, which will show the cost of the goods we Jiave sold ; and 
by referring to the credit side of the Mdse. account, we find how much we 
have realized for the goods we have sold. We now find the difference be- 
tween the cost of the goods sold and the amount for which we sold them, 
and this difference will be the gain on Mdse. We then transfer that gain 
to the " Loss & Gain account," close the Mdse. account " By Balance," and 
bring down on the debit side again, the balance of the Mdse. now on 
hand. 

14. It is customary among many business houses to allow a discount 
for cash on bills paid within a certain time. If we are allowed a discount 
for cash for goods we buy, the simplest way is to deduct the amount of 
the discount on the bills before entering them, and pay these bills within 
the time allowed for discount. If we allow a discount on our bills paid 
within a certain time, it is the easier way to give the parties credit in the 
Cash Book, when they pay, for the full amount of the bill, and debit Mdse 
(or Discount) on the opposite side of the Cash Book (credit side) for the 
discount allowed. (See 497, 498 and 534.) Some houses keep a " Discount 
account " for these discounts ; but it is the same in effect, and less trouble, 
to make the entries to the Mdse. account. In reality we get so much less 



CASH. 



639 



for the goods than we anticipated when we sold them, consequently we 
have credited Mdse. for just the amount of that discount too much, and 
it is now proper to debit the Mdse. account for the amount of that dis- 
count. 



CASH. 

75. Since the Cash Book is the Cash account, this account is never 
kept in the Ledger by the practical business man ; but there are a few 
" old fogies," and more business colleges, who still adhere to the anti- 
quated system. The account is here given in order to show how it was 
kept by our forefathers. However, all these rules, forms, etc, may be 
judiciously used, by applying them to the debit and credit sides of the 
Cash Book, showing when we enter an amount on the debit side of the 
Cash Book, and when on the credit side. 



76. Debit, at commencement of 
business, for amount of cash on 
hand, including the amount on de- 
posit in the bank ; for since it is 
not necessary to keep a bank ac- 
count, this is also called cash on 
hand. (See 86J.)

No. 4. 



86. EXPLANATION. Bank Drafts, Sight Drafts, Checks, Pension Checks, 
Money Orders, Due Bills, and all orders for which we can get cash upon 
presentation, are called Cash ; consequently, when we receive any of these 
we debit Cash, and when we give any out we credit Cash. The debit 
side of the Cash account is always the larger, as, of course, it is impossible 
to pay out more cash than we receive. (See 13 and 43 to 46.) 

861-2. BANK ACCOUNT. It is unnecessary labour to keep a Bank ac- 
count in the Ledger. It is now the custom with nearly all practical busi- 
ness men to call the amount on deposit in the bank so much cash on hand, 
and to keep no account with the bank in their Ledger. Instead of this, 
they keep their account with the bank on the stub of the check-book in 
the following manner : When they begin using a check-book they enter 
on the stub of the book the amount they have on deposit in the bank 
and when they make a deposit they add the amount deposited to the 
amount they had on deposit ; then when they draw checks on the bank 
they deduct the amounts of such checks from the amount on deposit. 
This shows, at any time, the amount to their credit in the bank. Of 



M .\-MTFACTURING. 



641 



course, besides a check-book, a bank-book is kept, in which the deposits 
that are made are entered by the bank-teller. 

The checks drawn on the bank are usually entered in the bank-book 
once a month, at which time the bank-book is balanced by the bank- 
clerk and shows how much is on deposit or to our credit in the bank 
which amount should just agree with the amount on deposit, as shown by 
the stub of our check- book, unless there are checks out that have not yet 
been presented to the bank for payment. When the banker has " written 
up " our bank-book he hands us, stamped " Paid," all the checks that we 
have drawn on the bank, and these he calls " vouchers returned." 



MANUFACTURING. 



87. Debit, at commencement of 
business, for value of manufactured 
goods on hand, as shown by the 
Inventory. 

89. Debit for all goods returned 
to us after we have sold them. 



88. Credit for all manufactured 
goods we sell. 



90. Directions for dosing the Manufacturing account at the end of 

the year : 

1st. Write on the credit side " By Inventory " for the value of the manu- 
factured goods we now have on hand. 

2nd. Close all the accounts we have kept in the Ledger to show the 
amounts consumed in the different articles of manufacture, and transfer 
amount lost on all such accounts to the debit side of this account, desif- 
nating the accounts upon which such accounts were lost. Also, close the 
" Labour account " and transfer the amount lost on labour to the debit side 
of this account. 

3rd. Now proceed with the closing of this account precisely the same 
as with the closing of the Merchandise account Par. 71 from 2nd to 5th, 
inclusive bringing down on the debit side of the Manufacturing account, 
after it has been closed, the value of the manufactured goods on hand for 
the beginning of the new year. 

91. EXPLANATION. When we manufacture the goods we sell, we call, 
the account upon which we speculate " Manufacturing," or " Manufac- 
turer," instead of " Merchandise." We debit this account when we com- 

oo 



(J4.2 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

mence business, if we have any manufactured goods on hand for the then 
present worth of those goods. We debit this account at the end of the 
year for what the goods cost us which we manufactured during the year. 
We ascertain what the goods cost us in the following-described way : 
We open separate accounts at the beginning of the year, for all such ar- 
ticles as we are going to buy to use in the manufacture of our goods ; ami 
during the year, whenever we buy anything to use in the manufacture of 
our goods, we charge the articles to the respective accounts to which they 
belong. At the end of the year we take an inventory of each of these ar- 
ticles, to ascertain the value of what remains unused, after which we 
credit each of these accounts " By Inventory," in red ink, for the respec- 
tive amount on hand ; we then find the difference between the two sides 
of each account, and credit it " By Manufacturing," in red ink, for that 
difference the difference being the amount of that article actually used 
in the manufacture of the goods. We now close the account and bring 
down on the debit side, below the closing lines, the amount remaining un- 
used for the beginning of the new year ; after which we carry over 
to the debit side of the "Manufacturing account" the amount used or 
lost on this " Article account " all the accounts of articles used in the 
manufacture of the goods being treated in the same manner. For exam- 
ple : If we were manufacturing woollen goods, we would keep a " Wool 
account," an " Oil account," a " Dye Stuffs account," etc., etc. At the end 
of the year we would ascertain how much of each wool, oil and dye 
stuffs we had on<hand still unused, and would close the accounts accord- 
ing to the instructions above, carrying amounts lost on such accounts to 
the debit side of " Manufacturing account," instead of to " Loss & Gain," 
We keep a " Machinery account," and debit it for the cost of all machin- 
ery we buy. During the year we charge this account for all repairs on 
the machineiy for which we have to pay, and at the end of the year we 
approximate the value of the machinery, allowing something for the 
" wear and tear," after which, we close this account the same as we do the 
others, carrying the amount lost to the debit side of the " Manufacturing 
account." We keep a " Labour account," in order to show the amount 
paid our employe's for making the goods, which account we also close and 
carry to the debit of " Manufacturing." The " Freight and cartage ac- 
count " may also with propriety be closed and carried into the " Manufac- 
turing account," instead of to " Loss and Gain." After all of these ac- 
counts have been carried into the " Manufacturing account," we credit 
this accout " By Inventory," in red ink, for the present worth of the 
manufactured goods we have on hand. The books are then closed the

same as in any other business, the amount gained on the " Manufacturing 
account," being also carried into the " Loss & Gain account." 

STORE AND OFFICE FIXTURES. 



9'i. Debit, at commencement of 
business, for value of store and of- 
fice fixtures on hand. 

93. Debit for everything we buy 
for fitting up the store and office, 
such as counters and shelves, scales, 
safes, stoves, desks, etc,, etc. Teams 
and waggons, are also of tea charged 
to this account, but it is customary 
and the most practical way to open 
a " Team and Waggons account." 



94. Credit for anything we sell, 
for which we charged this account 



when we bought it. 



95 Direction* for closing the Store and Office Fixtures account at the 

end of tie. year : 

1st. Write on the credit side " By Inventory," in red ink, for the value 
of the store and office fixtures on hand. 

2nd. Find the difference between the two sides of this account (Inven- 
tory included), and the amount that the debit side exceeds the credit will 
be the amount lost on store and office fixtures; after which, write on the 
credit side of this account, in red ink,"" By Loss & Gain " for amount lost 
which will now make the account balance. 

3rd. Rule the closing lines and write the total amount between the 
lines. 

4th. Write on the debit side of this account, below the closing lins 
in black ink, " To Inventory," and bring down the value of the store and 
office fixtures now on hand, for the beginning of the new year. 

5th. Carry amount lost on store and office fixtures over to the " Loss 
& Gain account," writing on the debit side of that account, in black ink, 
To Store & Office Fixtures " for the amount lost, which concludes the 
closing of the Store and Office Fixtures account. 

90. EXPLANATION. We take an inventory of Store and Office Fixtures 
at the end of the year the same as of Mdse, valuing them also at the pre- 
sent worth, and not at what they cost us. After! having estimated the 
present value, we close the account according to instructions above given. 



C44 



THE HOME, FARM AND BJ|(3INESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



After having credited the account " By Inventory," the debit side will be 
the larger, and the difference between the two sides will be a loss, as there 
is always more or less " wear and tear " on the fixtures during the year ; 
consequently, they are constantly depreciating in value. If our fixtures 
are apparently in as good order at the end of the year as they were at the 
beginning, we call them worth the whole amount for which the account 
is charged, and allow it to stand untouched, calling it a Resource. Some 
houses call the account " Store Fixtures ; " others call it " Office Fixtures," 
carrying all the store and office fixtures into the same account. 



REAL ESTATE. 



9T. Debit, at commencement of 
business, for value of any Real Es- 
tate we own, as lots and farms. 

98. Debit for all lots and farms 
we buy. 



99. Credit for all lots and farms 
we sell. 



100. EXPLANATION. We allow this account to stand untouched from 
year to year and call it a Resource, unless the property increases or de- 
creases in value ; in such a case we close it the same as we do the Mdse. 
or Store Fixtures accounts. 

101. If we are in a wholesale business, we sometimes have customers 
who become financially embarrassed or " hard up ; " and we, in order to 
get good security for the payment of the amount due us, take from these 
customers mortgages on any lots or farms which they may own. If these 
customers cannot pay when these notes become due, we foreclose the mort- 
gages, when, in some Counties, these lots and farms come into our possession. 
We can then debit " Real Estate " for such lots and farms ; or, open an 
account for each lot or farm, naming it after the former owner, as : " Bow- 
park Farm," " Johnson Lot," etc., with address or location. The latter is 
recommended as the better method. When these accounts are opened, 
they are treated the same as the " Real Estate account." 



BUILDING.

business, for value of any buildings 
we may own.

Fixtures account. (See 95 and 9G.)

118. Directions for balancing the Bills Receivable account at the end of 
the year : 

1st. Find the difference between the two sides of this account, then 
write on the credit side " By Balance," in red ink, for this difference, which 
will make the account balance. 

2nd. Now rule the closing lines and write the total amounts between 
these lines. 

3rd. Write on the debit side of this account, below the closing lines, 
in black ink, " To Balance," and the amount of the difference, as found 
above, which must exactly agree with the notes we have on hand. 

119. EXPLANATION. Bills receivable account is an account of Notes 
and Time Drafts (or Acceptances (receivable to us, hence "Bills or Notes 
Receivable." 

120. This account is, in effect, in one respect like the Cash Book or 
Cash Account ; for, when we receive a note, we debit Bills Receivable, 
and when we give out that note, we credit Bills Receivable. We debit 
the account for all the notes and acceptances we receive, and credit it 



BILLS RECEIVABLE (NOTES RECEIVABLE.) 647 

whenever we return or give out any of those notes or acceptances; there- 
fore, the difference between the two sides of this account should at any 
time show the exact amount of notes we have on hand remaining unpaid. 
The similarity of the Cash account to the Bills Receivable account arises 
in this : We debit Cash for the Cash we receive, and credit Cash when- 
ever we give out any, the difference between the two sides of the account 
showing, at any time, the exact amount of cash on hand. 

121. The Bills Receivable account is, in another respect, like a personal 
account owing us ; for, when a person gives us a note, we give that person 
credit and transfer the debt which heretofore stood on his account to the 
debit of Bills Receivable account, which now shows that the Bills Receiv- 
able account is owing us instead of the person. Illustrating the account 
in this way, we will say that this person is responsible for " Mr. Bills Re- 
ceivable's" indebtedness, and is obliged to pay it when it becomes due ; so 
when he pays the note we credit " Mr. Bills Receivable," and write in the 
explanation column the name of the maker of the note. 

122. The three principal objects in taking notes from our customers 
are : 1st. To have written acknowledgments from the parties of their 
indebtedness, so that if we were obliged to enter upon legal proceedings in 
order to collect the amounts, we would not have to prove the indebtedness; 
whereas if they were open accounts, we would sometimes be obliged to do 
so. 2nd. Another object is, if we are in need of money, we take these 
notes and discount them in the bank, getting the money to use in that 
\va)' 3rd. Still another is, in order to get interest on the accounts ; for 
some persons object to paying interest on their accounts after they are 
past due, but as it is customary to give notes made with interest for ac- 
counts past due, they do not object to paying it in this way. 

123. When the maker of a note cannot pay its full face value when it 
becomes due, but makes a part payment, we credit " Bills Receivable" for 
the amount paid, and endorse on the back of the note the amount of the 
payment, in the plainest possible manner, thus : " January 12, 18S1, paid 
$50.00." 

124. When the maker of a note cannot pay when it becomes due, but 
wishes to " renew the note," the renewal may be recorded in any one of 
the three following described ways : 1st. By simply taking the Bill Book 
(see 25) and writing in the " Remarks " column, opposite the entry for the 
old note, " Renewed," and then entering on this same book the new note 
just received ; or, 2nd. By debiting the person and crediting Bills Receiv- 
able for the old note surrendered, and then crediting the person and debit- 
ing Bills Receivable for the new note received ; or, 3rd. By debiting Bills 



648 THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Receivable for the new note received, and crediting Bills Receivable for 
the old note surrendered. The first and second methods are the most 
common in use, and are therefore recommended. 

195. When we get a note discounted in the bank, the note is paid so 
far as we are concerned, so we must credit " Bills Receivable " for the full 
face^of the note on the debit side of the Cash Book, and debit " Interest " 
on the opposite side of the Cash Book for the amount of the discount. 
(See 489 and 509 ; also 153.) If, on the other hand, the note is drawing 
interest, the rate per cent, of which is satisfactory to the bank, and some 
interest has already accrued at the time we get the note discounted, the 
bank then pays us the full face of the note plus the accrued interest ; we 
then credit " Bills Receivable " for the face of the note, and " Interest " for 
the amount received for accrued interest. (See 495 and 496.) 

126. If, after our having a note discounted in the bank, the maker 
should fail to pay when it becomes due, we are then obliged to " take up 
the note," i. e., give the bank a check or the money for the face of the 
note and the interest accrued to date, when the note again becomes our 
property; therefore we debit "Bills Receivable Account" for the face of 
the note, and " Interest Account " for the accrued interest. This note Le- 
ing now called a " past-due note." 

1*27. When a note is received, which was made by one party payable 
to another and endorsed over to us, care should be taken to see whether 
there are any payments endorsed on the note ; for, of course, a note is 
worth only its face less the payments, if any have been made. 

1*28. As the difference between the two sides of the Bills Receivable 
account should at any and all times exactly agree with the total value of 
the notes we have on hand, the book-keeper should take the notes as often 
as once a month, put down the value of each on a piece of paper, and 
afterward find the total of these amounts to see whether it agrees with 
the amount required by the Bills Receivable account. As much responsi- 
bility rests upon the book-keeper in having the notes on hand agree with 
the Bills Receivable account, as does in having the cash on hand agree 
with the Cash Book ; for, if the notes on hand do not agree with the Bills 
Receivable account, it shows " there is a nut loose somewhere." When 
we post an amount to the Bills Receivable account, we write in the ex- 
planation column the name of the maker of the note ; the date and the 
time may also be added in the explanation, so that if there be a mistake 
on the account we may check off from the credit side to the debit the- 
notes that have been paid, and in this way ascertain where the mistake is.

135 Directions for balancing the Bills Payable account at the end of 
the year : 

1st. Find the difference between the two sides of this account, and then 
write on the debit side, in red ink, " To Balance" for that difference, which 
will make the account balance. 

2nd. Now rule the closing lines and bring down the total amounts be- 
tween the lines. 

3rd. Write on the credit side, below the closing lines, " By Balance," 
in black ink, for the difference above found, which difference should ex- 
actly agree with the notes and acceptances we owe. 

136. EXPLANATION. Bills Payable account is an account of Notes and 
Acceptances given by us, and consequently payable by us ; hence, Bills 
(or Notes') Payable. We credit Bills Payable when we give a note or 
accept a time-draft ; and when we pay that note or draft we debit Bills 
Payable. 

137. This account is, in effect, like a personal account we owe ; for 
when we give a person a note, or accept a time-draft which he draws on 
UN we debit this person's account, and transfer the credit which hereto- 
fore existed on same to the credit of Bills Payable account ; so that, illus- 
trating tJre account in this manner, we are now owing " Mr. Bills Payable" 
in.stwul of this person. Now, when the amount becomes due, this " Mr. 
Bills Payable " " comes to us in such a questionable shape," being in the 
form of a note, that we must pay him. We then debit " Mr. Bills Pay- 
able," in order to show that the debt exists no longer, in so far as that one 
amount is concerned. 

138. The difference between the two sides of this account should at 
any time exactly agree with the notes and acceptances we have out- 
standing, or the notes we have given and the time-drafts we have accepted 
which still remain unpaid. 

139. When we make an entry on the Bills Payable account, we always 
write in the explanation column the name of the person to whom we gave 
the note ; the date of the note and time may also be added, so that if 
there be a mistake in this account, i.e., if at any time the amount of our 
notes outstanding does not agree with the difference between the two 
sides of this account, we may then check from the debit side to the credit 
the notes that have been paid, and in this way find the mistake. 

11O. The reason we give notes and accept tima-drafts is, because the 
parties from whom we buy request us to do so, with the same objects in 
view which we have when we take notes from our customers. (See 122.) 



BILLS RKrKIVAP.LE AND BILLS PAYABLE. C51 

BILLS RECEIVABLE AND BILLS PAYABLE 

ACCOUNTS. 

141. Beginners in the study of book-keeping sometimes get these two 
accounts confused, but all doubts may at such times be easily and quickly 
dispelled by soliloquizing in the following way: "Will the money be 
receivable to, or payable by us when this note is due ? If receivable to us, 
Bills Receivable account is affected, and we must make the entry to the 
Bills Receivable account ; if payable by us, Bills Payable account is affected, 
and we must make the entry to the Bills Payable account." 

1<12. Accepting a time-draft which a person draws upon us, is exactly 
the same in effect as giving that person a note ; for, by so doing, we pro- 
mise to pay him at the expiration of a certain period of time, with or 
without interest, for value received, a certain amount, which is neither 
more nor less than we do when we give a note. When a person accepts 
and returns to us a time-draft which we made on him, it is, of course, the 
same in effect as though we received a note from him. Time-draft and 
Acceptance are but different names for the same paper. Acceptance is 
the one most in use, but Time-Draft is the term adopted in this book, as 
it is moie readily comprehended by the pupil it showing, at once, that 
a certain time is given in which to pay the draft. Time-Drafts are of 
no value whatever, until they have been accepted and returned to the 
drawers, or the persons who draw the drafts ; as, not until then is a 
written promise to pay made ; therefore, no entry is made until the draft 
has been returned accepted, when the entry is made precisely the same as 
if a note had been received or given. 

143. There are four kinds of drafts, viz. : Bank Drafts, On-Demand 
Drafts, Sight Drafts, and Time Drafts. The first three belong to the 
Cash account, and the last, as heretofore explained, belongs to the Bills 
Receivable and Bills Payable accounts. A Bank Draft is a draft drawn 
by one bank on another. An On-Demand Draft is a draft drawn by one 
person upon another, and is payable on demand, or immediately. A 
Sight Draft is a draft drawn by one person upon another " at sight," and 
if accepted by the person upon whom it is drawn, is payable just three 
days after it is accepted. Drafts are sometimes drawn at " one, three, or 
five days' sight," and made payable to either a banker or some other per- 
son. When they are thus drawn, we accept them in the same manner 
that we would a Time Draft, but make no entry of it, simply making a 
memorandum in lead pencil on their account in the Ledger similar to 



C52 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYC'T.or.'KDIA. 



this : " Ace. St. Draft," to show that we have accepted such a draft 
and when the paper becomes due we pay it and charge the person direct, 
as we would have done had he drawn a draft " on demand" and we paid 
it at once. When drafts are drawn in this way, and are accepted by us, 
the bank to whom the draft is made payable leaves a "notice" with us 
showing when the paper falls due, the amount of same, also collection 
charges, if any. When due, we pay the draft, charge the person and 
credit Cash, as it is a cash transaction. The object in drawing drafts 
" at sight," or " at one, three, or five days' sight," is so as not " to take 
the person by surprise," but to give him a little time in which to meet 
the obligation ; there being thus more certainty of the draft's being paid- 
Drafts drawn in this way have three days of grace in addition to the 
time given. It is not deemed advisable to run the entries through the 
Bills Payable account when we accept a draft drawn on such short time ; 
but when drawn on ten days or longer time, we call it a Time-Draft, and 
make the entry to the Bills Payable account. 



INTEREST (OR USE OF MONEY). 



144. Debit for all cash we pay 
ouf for interest on the notes which 
we have given to other parties. 

146. Debit for amount deducted 
by the bank from the face of a note 
which we have had by them dis- 
counted. 

148. Debit at the end of the year 
for the accrued interest to date on 
the interest-bearing notes we owe. 
(See 160 and 163.) 



145. Credit for all cash we re- 
ceive for interest on the notes which 
we have received from other parties. 

147. Credit for discount allowed 
to us by other parties for paying 
our notes before due. 

149. Credit, at the end of the 
year, for the accrued interest to date 
on the interest-bearing notes \ve 
hold against other parties. 
155 and 158.) 



15O. Directions for closing the Interest account at the end of the y?<n- : 
1st. Find the difference between the two sides of this account. If the , 
credit side be the larger, the amount the credit exceeds the debit is the 
gain on Interest; we then write on the debit side of this account, in n;<l 
ink, "To Loss & Gain" for amount gained. If the debit side be the hir^.-r, 
the amount the debit exceeds the credit is the loss on Interest; we then 
write on the credit side of this account, in red ink, the amount lost, which 
in either case would make the account balance. 



INTEREST (OR USE OF MONEY). 653 

2nd. Rule the closing lines and write the total amounts between the 
lines. 

3rd. If there be a gain, carry amount gained over to the " Loss & Gain 
account," writing on the credit side of that account, in black ink, " By 
Interest," for amount of the gain. If a loss, carry amount lost to the 
debit side, writing " To Interest " for amount of the loss. 

151. EXPLANATION. Interest is simply a term used for the use of 
'money. When we pay for the use of money, we debit "Interest" for the 
use of the money which we receive, and credit " Cash " for the cash we 
give for the use of that money. (See 144 and 146.) When we are paid 
for the use of money which we have given, we debit " Cash " for the cash 
we receive, and credit " Interest " for the use of the money we give. (See 
145 and 147.) Interest does not arise from notes only; for, when we 
have an account which is past due against a customer of ours, we charge 
him for interest. When this is done we debit the person and credit 
" Interest," as we, in reality, give to that person the use of the money for 
the length of time that his account is past due. When we allow an ac- 
count which we are owing to go past due, we are sometimes obliged to 
pay for interest ; we then debit " Interest " and credit the person to whom 
we owe the account, as we, in reality, receive from the person the use of 
the money which should have been paid when his account was due, up to 
the present time. 

152. DISCOUNT. Discount is another term for the use of money ; there- 
fore, both being the same in effect it is not necessaiy to have an account 
for each, so we call interest and discount the same, and keep only one 
account on the Ledger, namely : " Interest." 

153. When we are in need of money, we take some of the notes which 
we hold against other parties (Bills Receivable) to the bank and get them 
" discounted." If these notes are not drawing interest, the banker deducts 
from the face of the note a certain rate per cent, per annum for the time 
the note has yet to run before due, and hands us the balance in cash. 
This amount which he deducts from the face of the note is the " discount" 
or the amount we pay him for the use of that money which he hands us, 
for the unexpired time on the note. For example : If we hold a note for 
$100 which is made without interest and has yet 60 days to run before 
due, and we get it discounted in the bank, the banker, deducting $1 for 
discount, hands us $99 ; we then debit cash for $99 and interest for the 
discount $1 and credit Bills Receivable for the full face of the note 
$100. (See 125, also 490 and 512.) 



654 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



154. When a person to whom we give a note allows us a certain 
amount for paying that note before due, we 'debit Bills Payable for the 
full face of the note ; and credit " Cash" for the cash we pay, and " In- 
terest " for the discount we are allowed. 

Some business houses keep a separate account for Discount, but this is 
not necessary. (See also 74.) 



INTEREST RECEIVABLE. 



155. Debit, at the end of the 

year, for the accrued interest to 
date on all the interest bearing 
notes and time drafts we hold 
against ether parties, i.e., for the 
total interest due us to date on our 
Bills Receivable. 



156. Credit when the accrued 
interest is paid which was charged 
on opposite side of this account. 



157. Directions for cloving the Interest Receivable account at the end 

of the year : 

1st.- Find the difference between the two sides of this account, and 
then write on the credit side, in red ink, " By Balance" for that difference, 
which will make the account balance. 

2 n d. Rule the closing lines and write the total amounts between the 

lines. 

3rd. Write on debit side of this account, in black ink, below the clos- 
ing lines, " To Balance" for amount of this difference which shows the 
balance of interest which is still due and receivable to us. 

158. EXPLANATION. At the end of each year, we compute the interest 
on all the interest-bearing Bills Receivable we have on hand, from the 
dates of such notes up to the end of the year ; excepting those notes the 
dates of which extend back over one year ; these notes we compute the 
interest on for only one year, because the interest has on these already 
been computed up to the first of the year and charged to this account. 
We then debit " Interest Receivable account " for the total amount of 
interest due us, and credit the " Interest account " proper, for the same 
amount. Thus it will at once be seen that the "Interest Receivable 
account " is an account indicating a resource, being the amount of in- 
terest due us up to the end of the year ; therefore, it is never carried over 
to the " Loss & Gain account," the gain on interest being carried to the 
" Interest account," as above indicated. 



INTEREST PAYABLE. 

159. The Interest Receivable and Interest Payable accounts are such 
" complicated affairs" that they are seldom used in business, unless one of 
the partners wishes to withdraw from the business, or unless they wisli 
to take into the business a new partner, at which time they desire to 
know the exact worth of the firm ; and in order to find this they must 
ascertain how much interest is due to the firm on the notes on hand, and 
how much interest is owing by the firm on the interest-bearing notes 
outstanding. The complication in these accounts arises in finding, at the 
time the interest is paid for, what portion of the interest to enter to Inter- 
est Receivable or Interest Payable, and what portion to the Interest proper 
account; and in making entries to so many accounts, when it would be 
entirely proper and much less work, to keep only one account instead of 
the three, namely, " Interest," and make the entry to that account not 
until the interest is paid for. 

INTEREST PAYABLE. 

161. Debit, when the accrued in- III 16O. Credit, at the end of the 

terest is paid, which was credited on year, for the accrued interest to date 
the opposite side of this account. on all the in terest- bearing notes and 

time-drafts we owe, i. e., for the total 
interest we owo to date on our Bills 
Payable. 

162. Directions for closing tlie Interest Payabh account at the end of 
the year: 

1st. Find the difference between the two sides of this account, and 
write on the debit side, in red ink, " To Balance " for amount of that dif- 
ference, which will make the account balance. 

2nd Rule the closing lines and write the total amounts between the 
lines. 

3rd. Write on credit side of this account, in black ink, below the clos- 
ing lines, " By Balance " for amount of this difference, which difference 
is the balance of interest we owe for and is payable by us. 



163. EXPLANATION. At the end of each year, we compute the interest 
on all the interest-bearing Bills Payable we owe, from the dates of such 
notes up to the end of the year, with same exceptions as in 158. We then 
credit " Interest Payable account " for the total amount of such interest 
due, and debit the interest account proper for the same amount. It will 



656 



Till': HOMF., FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA, 



now be seen that the "Interest Payable account" indicates a liability, 
being the interest we owe for up to the end of the year therefore is not 
carried to the " Loss & Gain account," but is allowed to stand on our 
books the same as the " Bills Payable account." The loss on interest we 
have to pay for is carried to the Interest account at the time we credit 
Interest Payable, as indicated above.

cept. (See 114, 115 and 142.) 



173. EXPLANATION. When we first enter into business, we open ac- 
counts with all persons who are owing us, and debit all such persons for 
the amounts they owe us. j. Whenever we sell a person goods and do not 
receive payment therefor, or whenever we loan money to a person and do 
not take a note for the amount of that loan, we debit the person ; and 
when these persons to whom we sell the goods or loan the money pay us 
in any way, or give us a note.^or accept a time draft which we draw on 
them, we credit them. (For remarks on balancing this account at the end

amounts we are owing them. Whenever we buy goods, and do not pay 
the person from whom we buy, or whenever we borrow money, and do 
not give the person a note for the amount borrowed, we credit the per- 
son ; and when we pay these persons from whom we bought the goods or 
borrowed the money, or give them a note, or accept a time draft which 
they draw on us, we debit them.

" 1st," for beginning of the new year. 

5th. Write on the debit side of Loss & Gain account, " To Expense " 
for amount of loss on this account, as found in " 2nd " above. 

193. EXPLANATION In reading over rules 189 and 190, it will at once 
be seen that no business can be conducted without an expense ; it will 
also be seen that the Expense account is the " foe in the field " against 
which the business man has to contend. All transactions which result in 
a loss to us may be carried into the Expense account, or the account may 
be divided into as many accounts as we wish to keep to represent the 
losses occasioned in our business. 

194. As it is a matter of gratification to the business man to have a 
more explicit and comprehensive statement of the expenses at the end of 
the year, it becomes necessary for him to classify his expenses by opening 



660 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

accounts for the different items of expense ; and whenever an amount is 
expended which would otherwise be debited to Expense, it is debited 
instead to the account to which it belongs. For example : If the business 
man wishes to know how much he expends during the year for clerk-hire, 
he keeps an account called " Salaries," and debits that account, instead of 
Expense, whenever anything is expended for clerk -hire; or, if he wishes 
to know how much is expended for freight and express charges, fuel, rent, 
drayage, insurance, advertising, travelling expenses, etc., etc., he opens an 
account with each, and whenever amounts are expended which would 
otherwise be debited to Expense, they are, instead, debited to the respec- 
tive accounts to which they belong. . When we thus divide the account 
we debit Expense account for all such items of expense as do not come 
under any of the accounts thus opened. 

195. When we take an inventory at the end of the year we sometimes 
take an account, or find the value of the unused salable expense articles 
we have on hand, i. e., articles that were debited to Expense when bought,, 
such as fuel, postage stamps, etc., we then close the account according to 
directions on this account. When we do not take an inventory in this 
way we close the account simply according to " 2nd, 3rd and 5th," of !!_. 

196. All accounts we open in the Ledger, in which to debit articles we 
buy to consume in the business, i. e., to use ourselves and not sell again, 
we close at the end of the year in the same manner in which, the Fuel 
account is closed. (See 200.) These articles must, however, be such as 
would be of value to anyone else, and consequently, salable articles. 

197. All accounts we open in the Ledger, in which to debit amounts 
that are at once and in entirety a " dead loss," we close at the end of the 
year in the same manner in which the Salaries account is closed (see 202), 
excepting that we write on the Loss & Gain account the name of the ac- 
count on which such loss was made.

1st. If there are any credits on this account, find the difference between 

the two sides and write on the credit side, in red ink, " By Loss & Gain " 
for the difference. If there are no credits, simply find the total amount 
of the debit side, and write on the credit side, in red ink, " By Loss & Gain" 
for such amount. 

2nd. Rule the closing lines and write the total amounts between the 
lines. 

3rd. Write on the debit side of Loss & Gain account, in black ink, 
" To Salaries " for amount lost on this account, as found in " 1st " above. 

203. EXPLANATION. W T hen we pay our clerks, book-keepers, etc., 
weekly, semi-monthly or monthly, the total amounts due them, it is not 
necessary to keep an account with each, but debit the amount paid them 
directly to the Salaries account. 

204. If we do not pay them regularly the amounts due them, but allow 
them to draw from their salary at pleasure, we then open an account 
for each of our employe's, debiting them whenever they draw any money, 
or take any merchandise for their private use ; and crediting them at the 
end of each month for their salary for the month. When we do this, on 
the last day of the month we enter in the Journal " Salaries Dr. to Sun- 
dries," and under this heading, we enter the names of each of our em- 
ploy e"s, giving each credit for his salary; and after we have the names 
and amounts all entered, we find the total of these amounts and debit 
Salaries account for such total amount in one entry. If the members of 



662 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



the firm allow themselves a salary from which to draw, their names are 
entered with the employe's and their private accounts treated the same as 
the accounts with the employe's. The accounts thus formed with our em- 
ploye's arc the same as any personal accounts we owe, unless the employ*? 
overdraws his account, and then, of course, " the shoe is on the other foot," 
being then the same as a personal account owing us. 



FREIGHT AND EXPRESS. 



2O5. Debit for all cash we pay 
out for freight and express charges. 



2O6. Credit for all cash we re- 
ceive from Railroad or Express com- 
panies as rebate or overcharge on 
freight or express. 



207. CLOSING. The Freight & Express account is closed the same as 
the Salaries account. (See 202.) Some firms however, carry the amount 
lost on freight and express to the Merchandise account, instead of to the 
Loss & Gain account, at the end of the year, reasoning thus : That the 
merchandise really costs them the price of the goods plus tlie freight This 
is, in fact the case ; but the usual custom in practice is to carry the Freight 
& Express account over to Loss & Gain with the other accounts on which 
we lose or gain. 

208. EXPLANATION. Some Railroad companies allow those business 
houses who have large quantities of freight shipped over their lines a 
" rebate," or " drawback." This rebate they usually settle monthly, and 
when they pay it, we credit Freight & Express account; unless, we open 
an account with the Railroad company in which to charge such over- 
charges ; we then, of course, credit the Railroad company's account when 
they settle for the charges we have against them. These Railroad com- 
panies have (they say) a certain rate from which they must not deviate ; 
consequently, all their freight bills must be made (out for the same class) 
at the same rate per 100 Ibs.; yet they must recognise the excess of pat- 
ronage in an extensive establishment over a small house in charges for 
freight, in the same manner as a wholesale merchant does one customer 
over another, and to do this, the freight company must resort to " rebate.'" 



TRAVELLING EXPENSES. 



663 



COLLECTION AND EXCHANGE. 



2O9. Debit for all cash we pay 
out for collection of drafts, notes and 
checks ; and for exchange on bank 
drafts, post-office orders, etc. 



21O. Credit for rebate on ex- 
change, if any. 



211. CLOSING. The Collection & Exchange account is closed at the 
end of the year the same as the Salaries account. (See 202.) 

212. EXPLANATION. Some banks allow their customers who purchase 
large quantities of exchange a rebate, for the same reason that the rail- 
road companies allow their patrons a rebate on freight. (See 208.) When 
they allow us a rebate, and pay or give us credit for same, we then credit 
Collection & Exchange. If the bank simply gives us credit in our bank 
book, which they usually do, we debit Cash and credit Collection & Ex- 
change ; and then enter on the stub of our check book the amount thus 
credited to us, as though it had been a deposit made by us, consequently 
increasing our deposit in the bank that amount. 

TRAVELLING EXPENSES. 



213. Debit for amount paid to 
our travelling agents, or expended 
by ourselves for travelling expenses. 

214. CLOSING. The Travelling Expenses account at the end of the 
year is closed the same as the Salaries account. (See 202.) 

215. EXPLANATION. This account is used only in a wholesale house 
where they employ travelling agents to sell their goods. There are many 
ways of treating the Travelling Expenses account, principal among which 
are the following methods : 

2S6. First Method. Some business houses employ travelling agents, 
paying them a regular salary and telling them to go out and sell their 
goods, and they will pay all tlieir expenses, ivhatever they may be. When 
this is done the expenses may be charged directly to the Travelling Ex- 
penses account ; or, an " Agent account " may be opened for each of the 
travelling agents, and when an amount is reported expended for expenses 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

by an agent, the amount may be charged to this Agent account, and at 
the end of each month, or at the end of the year, as we may prefer, this 
" Agent account " may be balanced by writing on the credit side, in red 
ink, <: By Travelling Expenses " for the total amount of same, and carry- 
ing this amount over to the debit side of Travelling Expenses account, 
writing there, in black ink, the name of the agent by whom this amount 
was expended. When we keep an " Agent account " in this way, it is 
simply as a matter of satisfaction to us to know how much is expended 
by each agent. 

217. Second Method. Some business houses pay their travelling agents 
a regular salary, and allow them besides a certain amount per day, p<T 
month, or per year, for travelling expenses. When this is done, an 
" Agent account" may be opened in the Ledger for each agent, and tl; 
accounts debited whenever any money is drawn for travelling expenses ; 
then, at the end of each month, an entry may be made on the Journal 
thus: " Travelling Expenses Dr. to Sundries," and under this heading 
enter the names of all our travelling agents, adding " Agent account " 
after each name, crediting to the respective Agent accounts the amounts 
allowed them for expenses. The difference may then be found between 
the two sides of the respective " Agent accounts," the Agent account 
balanced the same as in first method ; excepting, that this difference, 
instead of being carried to the Travelling Expenses account, is carried to 
the personal account of the agent, i.e., the account upon which i.s entered 
his regular salary, debiting the personal account of the agent, if he has 
drawn more than allowed by the firm for expenses, or crediting it if he 
has drawn less. 

218. Third Method. When the travelling agent is allowed a certain 
amount per day, per month, or per year, for travelling expenses, instead 
of opening an "Agent account," as in Second Method, we may, when an 
amount is drawn for expenses, charge the amount directly to the personal 
account of the agent, thus, at the end of each month, make an entry on 
the Journal the same as described in Second Method, excepting, instead 
of adding " Agent account" after each name, and crediting the amounts 
to the Agent accounts, we credit the amounts allowed for travelling ex- 
penses directly to the personal accounts of the agents. 

219. Fourth Method. Some houses, in addition to a regular salary 
and a certain amount for travelling expenses, pay their travelling agent - 
a certain percentage commission on the sal.vs they make sometimes on 
the sales from the beginning, and sometimes not until their sales hav.- 
reached a certain amount. This is partly done to insure extra effort* un 



BRANCH HOUSES. 



665 



the part of the agent to make large sales, and partly to show their 
appreciation of his hard work. When this is done, the commission thu* 
allowed may be charged to any one of the three following accounts, viz. : 
Agents' Commission, Merchandise, or Travelling Expenses, and credited 
either to the agent's personal account or to his " Agent account." The 
better way, perhaps, is to open an "Agents' Commission account" in the 
Ledger, and at the end of each month make an entry on the Journal 
thus : " Agents' Commission Dr. to Sundries,'' and under this heading 
enter the names of all the agents to whom we pay commission on sales, 
crediting either their " Agent accounts " or their personal accounts for the 
commission due them, and debiting the " Agents' Commission account " 
for the total amount. 

330. Fifth Method. There are a few business houses who do not pay 
their agents a regular salary, but simply pay them a certain per cent, 
commission on the sales they make, allowing the agents to defray their 
own expenses. When this is done, the commission thus allowed may be 
charged to any one of the three accounts as described in Fourth Method, 
and credited at the end of each month directly to the agent's personal 
account. This is a method seldom used in business, as there are but few 
agents who are willing to engage with a house on such terms. 

331. Thus it will be seen that the " Agent accounts " are always 
balanced at the end of each month, and carried either into the Travelling 
Expenses account or into the personal account of the agent direct, con- 
sequently, these Agent accounts are simply transient, and remain open 
only a month at a time. However, there are a few exceptions to this 
rule, in which the accounts are closed only at the end of the year these 
exceptions occurring usually under the First Method. When the " Agent 
accounts " are closed only at the end of the year, they are then carried 
into the Travelling Expenses account, and show the amount expended by 
each agent for the entire year in one entry. 

333. The travelling agents' personal accounts are of course credited for 
their salaries at the end of each month, the same as the accounts with our 
other employe's, and thereafter treated the same as any other personal 
account. (See 204.)

OUR ACCOUNTS WITH THEM. 

233. EXPLANATION. The accounts with our Branch Houses are kept 
on the same principle as the " Accounts with persons to whom we Sell 
Goods " (See 1G4 to 173), consequently are neither .more nor less on our 
books than simply personal accounts. When we close our books at the 
end of the year, we allow these accounts to stand on the Ledger untouched, 
calling the accounts Resources. 

23 1. We debit our Branch Houses whenever we send them any goods 
from our stock. Some houses charge these goods at their fo -t, and others 
charge them at a profit. When we buy goods on account and receive 
bills therefor, some of which goods were bought for our Branch Houses. 
we mark on such bills the names of the Branch Houses to which they 
belong. When we enter our bills, we can adopt either one or the other 
of two methods, viz. : 1st. (1) To assort the bills, getting those bills to- 
gether which are for goods for oUr own stock, and debiting our merchan- 
dise account for same, crediting each of the parties from whom we bi:v. 
then getting those together which are for the different Branch Hou 
and debiting the respective Branch Houses for the bills belonging to each 
and crediting the parties from whom we buy ; or (2) to have a " Merchan- 
dise " column and a column for each of our Branch Houses, and carry out 
the amounts in the columns to the debit of the respective accounts to 
which they belong, crediting [the parties from whom we buy for such 
amounts the respective Branch Houses accounts and the Merchandise 
account being debited only at the end of the month for the total purchases 
for each for the month. The last named is the plan adopted by the larger 
houses where they have a book ruled with these extra columns, which 



BRANCH HOUSES. 667 

book they use exclusively for entering the bills of their purchases. 2nd, 
The second method is to debit our Merchandise account for all the goods 
we buy, whether for our own stock or for our Branch Houses, crediting 
the parties from whom we buy ; and then to debit the Branch Houses and 
credit Merchandise for such goods as were bought for them. This method 
requires much more work than the first, because we are obliged to copy 
on our Sales Books the items on the bills which were sent to the Branch 
Houses. It is the general custom of the Parent House to assume all the 
liabilities of the Branch Houses, consequently, to pay all the bills con- 
tracted by them. 

23d. We credit our Branch Houses whenever we get goods from them 
with which to replenish our stock on some lines in which we had become 
short ; and for all the cash they send to us on account ; and for all notes, 
acceptances, etc., which they have received from their customers and turn 
over to us. 

236. At the end of the year, when our Branch Houses report the net 
gain or net loss by each, we debit or credit each of the respective Branch 
Houses accounts, and debit or credit our Loss & Gain account for the net 
loss or net gain by each reported. IF A NET GAIN. If a Branch House 
reports a net gain in the business, we debit the Branca House account 
and credit our Loss & Gain account for such gain, writing on the credit 
side of the Loss & Gain account, as an explanation, the name of the Branch 
House upon which the gain was made. Having made this entry, the dif- 
ference between the two sides of our account with the Branch House 
should show the present worth of that house or the amount they owe us, 
which amount should just agree with the difference between their total 
Liabilities and their total Resources (excluding their account with us). 
IF A NET LOSS. If the Branch House reports a net loss in the business, we 
credit the Branch House account and debit our Loss & Gain account for 
such loss, writing on the debit side of the Loss & Gain account, as an ex- 
planation, the name of the Branch House upon which the loss was made- 
Having made this entry, the difference between the two sides of the Branch 
House account should show the present worth of that house, or the amount 
they ought now to have credited to our account on their Ledger, which 
amount should just agree with the difference between their total Liabilities 
and their total Resources (excluding their account with us). If the Branch 
Houses keep a Stock account, in addition to the Personal accounts with 
the Parent House, that, of course, must too be excluded from the Resources- 
and Liabilities and included in the remarks " their account with us " here- 
tofore used. 



<3C8 THE HOME, FARM A\D BUSINESS CYCLOP-EDIA, 

HOW THEIR BOOKS ARE KEPT. 

2517. Our Branch Houses each keep a full set of books in the same 
manner as we keep our books, and precisely the same as books are kept 
in any business, treating our account on their Ledger the same as they 
would any other accounts with persons from whom they bought goods on 
account, with the following two exceptions, viz. : 1st (1), instead of credit- 
ing parties from whom they buy goods on account, they turn the bills 
over to us to pay, debiting their Merchandise account for the same and 
crediting their account with us : or (2) they can debit their Merchandise 
account and credit the parties ; afterward, when they turn over the bills 
to us to pay, charge the parties and credit us, which amounts to the same 
but makes more work. It is not necessary for the Branch Houses to sub- 
mit the bills to the Parent House, but simply to make an itemized state- 
ment of the debts contracted with the different persons, and from this 
statement the Parent House can charge the Branch House and credit the 
different parties. 

5JJ18. When the Branch Houses are first opened, they open their books 
in the same way that books are opened in any store or business, excepting 
that they credit the Parent House for the net investment ; and at the end 
of the year the proceedings for closing the books are the same as in any 
other business finally debiting or crediting the Parent House for the net 
loss or the net gain in the business. 

2JI9. Either of two methods may be adopted by the Branch Houses in 
keeping the accounts with the Parent House, viz. : 1st. To each open 
two accounts with the Parent House a Stock account and a Personal 
account debiting or crediting the Stock account at the end of the year 
for the net loss or the net gain, as the case may be ; and treating the 
Personal account as described in 230. 2nd. To keep only one account 
with the Parent House, namely, a Personal account, entering all trans- 
actions with the Parent House dui'ing the year into that account, and at 
the end of the year debiting or crediting that account for the net loss or 
the net gain. If a Stock account is opened with the Parent House when 
the Branch first commences business, there can be no entry to this ac- 
count, for everything belongs to the Parent House, and must necessarily 
be credited to the Personal account of that House, and not to its Stock 
account ; but at the end of the year the net loss or net gain may be carried 
to the Stock account, and that would be the only item that would appear 
on that account ; therefore, it is deemed the better method to keep only 
& Personal account with the Parent Hou.se. 



SHIPPING BUSINESS. 669 

240. The Branch Houses render statements to us of all their expenses 
their purchases, their sales, etc., daily, weekly, or monthly, according to 
arrangement ; and these statements are filed away by us simply as memo- 
randas, no entry being made on our books, unless it be on a record book, 
which is not often done, as these reports are simply made out for our own 
satisfaction, in order that we may know the progress of the business in 
the different Branches. These Branch Houses at the end of the year each 
report to the Parent House the net gain or net loss in the business, as the 
case may be. (See 236.) 

SHIPPING BUSINESS. 

241. That business in which we engage for the purpose of buying 
goods and shipping them to others to be sold the persons to whom we 
ship the goods charging us for the selling of same a certain percentage 
on the sales is called " Shipping Business." When we first enter into 
business, the books are opened the same as in a general merchandise busi- 
ness ; the books are the same as those used in any other business, with 
the exception of a book called " The Shipping Ledger," the use of which 
will be hereinafter described. The principal books are the Shipping 
Ledger, the Journal, the Cash Book, and the Ledger. A Merchandise 
account is kept in the Ledger, which is charged for all merchandise we 
buy, and credited for all merchandise we sell. 

SHIPMENTS. 

242. THK SHIPPING LEDGER. The Shipping Ledger is a book used 
simply as a record book, in which to make a record of the goods we place 
ii* the hands of others to be sold. It is used as a book of original entry 
i.e., when a shipment is made it is at once recorded in this book. A book 
ruled in the common Ledger form is suitable for the Shipping Ledger. 
When we make a shipment, an account is opened in this book with the 
person to whom we ship. On the debit side is entered first the date, 
then the items, then the cost price of the goods, and under this is entered 
the charges which we pay for drayage, etc. After a shipment has been 
thus recorded, the account here opened is allowed to stand until the party 
to whom we shipped the goods renders to us an Account-Sales ; we then 
enter on the credit side, opposite the charge, the net proceeds of the sales 
thus reported ; after which, we debit the person and credit Merchandise 
in the Journal, simply entering the person's name, the amount, and the 
Shipping Ledger page upon which may be found the record of the sale 



C70 



THK HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



in detail. An account is then opened in the general Ledger for this per- 
son ; the amount thus charged to him in the Journal is posted to the debit 
side of his account here opened, and this account credited when remittance 
is made for the net proceeds. An extra column may be kept in the Journal 
in which to enter the merchandise sales, which will render it unnecessary 
to post the Merchandise oftener than once a month, the sales we make 
directly from our store being entered in this column, as well as the net 
proceeds of sales reported by the persons to whom we ship. The object 
of extending the cost of the goods in the Shipping Ledger, when we make 
a shipment, is in order that we may see whether we lose or gain on the 
shipment, and thus ascertain whether it pays to ship goods to that person. 
On the debit side of this Ledger is found the cost of the goods, and on the 
credit is found what we realized for them the difference between the 
two sides being the amount lost or gained. The goods charged to the 
different persons in the Shipping Ledger belong to us until reported sold ; 
consequently, a real charge is not made to the person until the sale is re- 
ported. Some shipping houses keep both a Sales Book and a Shipping 
Ledger, entering the shipment first on the Sales Book and afterward copy- 
ing it into the Shipping Ledger ; but as it is unnecessary work to thus 
enter the transaction twice, the Sales Book is dispensed with and the 
transaction is at once recorded in the Shipping Ledger. There are several 
forms for the Shipping Ledger in use ; but, as heretofore stated, a book 
ruled in common Ledger form may be used; however, it will be seen that 
two extra columns one on the debit side and one on the credit, in which 
to make a memorandum of the amount lost or the amount gained on the 
shipments are very convenient. By having these two extra columns, 
we may at any time ascertain how much we have gained or lost on the 
total shipments made to any person, by simply adding the two columns, 
" Losses " and " Gains," on his shipment account, and finding the difference 
between the sums total. In order that the book described may be more 
fully understood, a form for the same will here be given.

SHIPPING BUSINESS. 671 

344. At the end of the year we proceed with the closing of our books 
in the Shipping Business the same as in a general merchandise business, 
excepting, when the inventory is taken, the goods we have belonging to 
us consist of not only those which we have in our store, but also those 
which we have charged to the different parties in our Shipping Ledger, 
and which have not yet been reported sold ; therefore, after we have 
found the value of the goods we have in the store, we must go through 
our Shipping Ledger, and add to the inventory the value of the goods 
there found still unsold ; when we have done this our inventory is com- 
plete, and we are prepared to close the Merchandise, which is done in the 
manner described in 71. 

245. Another Method. There is another method of treating ship- 
ments, which is very little in use ; the reason for its not being in use will 
be readily understood after having read the following description of the 
method : Charge the person to whom we ship the goods a certain amount, 
which we think will be about what we will realize for the sale of the 
goods ; then, when this person renders to us an Account-Sales of the con- 
sicmment debit or credit his account for the difference between the amount 

O ' 

we charged him when we shipped the goods and the amount of the net 
proceeds as shown in the Account-Sales. If the net proceeds be less than 
the amount we had charged to him, debit Merchandise and credit his ac- 
count for the difference ; if more,, debit his account and credit Merchandise 
for the difference. When this method is adopted, the person to whom 
we ship the goods is charged at the time the goods are shipped, the same 
as though we had sold him the goods " out and out ; " thus an actual sale 
is recorded in the books when, in fact, it is only an anticipated sale 
hence, a false statement. According to this method, when a shipping 
merchant is financially embarrassed, and wants, for the satisfaction of his 
creditors, to make a "big showing" on his books, if so disposed he may 
charge the goods, when shipped, at exorbitant prices, and by so doing 
show (on consignments not yet reported sold) large amounts owing to him 
by parties to whom he has sold (?) goods. There are, of course, shipping 
merchants who are not financially embarrassed, who have no desire that 
their books should represent them worth more than they really are, and 
who do not charge the goode at exorbitant prices ; yet they keep the ac- 
counts with the persons to whom they ship according to this method. But 
to any reasonable mind it will at once be seen that an untrue statement 
is made in their books ; for the books show, in these accounts, a part of 
the resources of the firm to be personal accounts owing to them which 
should in reality be a showing of merchandise belonging to the firm.

COMMISSION BUSINESS. 

246. That business in which we engage for the purpose of selling goods 
belonging to others for the selling of which goods we an- to charge a cer- 
tain percentage on the sales is called " Commission Business." The 
business of a commission merchant consists of disposing of the goods sent 
to him by a shipping merchant; hence, in a strictly commission business 
none of the goods which the merchant has in his store belong to him ; 
therefore he can have no Merchandise account in his Ledger the accounts 
representing the gains in his business being " Commission," " Storage," 
" Labour," etc. The books used principally in this business are : Receiv- 
ing Book, Sales Book, Consignment Book, Journal, Cash Book and Ledger. 
The Journal, Cash Book and Ledger are of the same form as those used in 
any other business. The use of the Receiving Book, the Sales Book and 
the Consignment Book will be described under heading of " Receipts." It 
will be seen in the two different kinds of business, Shipping and Commis- 
sion, that the one is directly the opposite from the other the shipping 
merchant being constantly sending out goods, while the commission 
merchant is constantly receiving. Therefore, while the Shipping Business 
is described under heading of " Shipments," it is thought best to describe 
the Commission Business under heading of "Receipts." 

RECEIPTS. 

217. THE RECEIVING BOOK. The Receiving Book is a book upon 
which a record of the goods received to be sold on commission is first made. 
A common Journal ruling is suitable for this book. When goods are re- 
ceived to be sold on commission, we give the person from whom we receive 
the goods a consignment number on this book, and under or opposite this 
is entered, first the date, then the person's name and address, and then the 
description of articles received ; after which, as a memorandum, the 
charges paid for freight, drayage, etc., together with the name of the Rail- 
road or Steamboat Co. from whom received. As soon as the goods are 
received we stencil on each package the consignment number given them 
in this book, and they are therefore known, while in the store and when 
aalea are made from them, by that consignment number, and not by the 
name of the person to whom they belong. There are many conveniences 
which arise from this " consignment-number method," a few of which be- 
ing : the packages are marked in this manner much quicker than they 
could be if the owner's name \v,is used instead ; when any of the goods are 



COMMISSION BUSINESS. (573 

sold it is much the quicker way to write a Consignment No. on the Sales 
Book than to write the owner's name ; the salesman may not know to 
whom the goods belonged, the owner being simply identified by the Con- 
signment No. 

248. THE SALES BOOK. The Sales Book is a small book (ruled in 
common Journal form) used in which to record the on-account sales. 
When a sale is made on account, the person to whom we sell is charged 
in this book in the same manner as though the goods belonged to us 
excepting that after having recorded t!)e time upon which the goods were 
sold (30 days, 60 days, or whatever it may be), we add the Consignment 
No. to which they belonged, in order that we may know to whom the 
sale must be credited. From this book a sale thus recorded is posted to 
the debit of the person's account to whom we sold the goods on the Ledger, 
and to the credit of the owner (the person from whom we received the 
goods) on the Consignment Book. 

249. THE CONSIGNMENT BOOK. The Consignment Book is a book in 
which is kept the progressive sales accounts with the persons from whom 
we receive goods to be sold on commission. When the consignment is first 
received, we open an account with the person from whom we receive the 
goods in this book, entering on the debit side first the date, then the Con- 
signment No. given by the Receiving Book, then the name of the owner 
of the consignment, and, lastly, the number and description of the articles. 
The entry made thus far on this book is simply a memorandum of the 
goods received from the person, and as such it ever after remains. The 
further use of this book is described as follows, viz. : To the debit side is 
posted, from the Cash Book, all the charges we pay on the consignment 
for freight, drayage, etc. ; and to the credit side is posted, from the Cash 
Book and the Sales Book, all the sales. When the goods belonging to a 
consignment have all been sold, we enter on the debit side of the Consign- 
ment Book all of our charges, such as Insurance, Storage, Cooperage, 
Labour, Commission or whatever they may be ; after which we find the 
difference between the total charges and the total sales, which difference 
is the net -proceeds. We then close up this consignment and transfer the 
net proceeds to the Ledger, which is done by entering on the Consignment 
Book, under the charges, " To Net Proceeds " for the amount, which will 
make the consignment account balance; then, by opening an account in 
the Ledger with the person from whom we receive the consignment, and 
crediting this account for the net proceeds the account here opened being 
debited when we make remittance for same. Our charges for commission, 
etc., heretofore referred to, may be at once entered on the Consignment 

QQ 



(574 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Book and posted directly from this book to the credit of those accounts 
on the Ledger. As soon as a consignment is " closed out," ('. e., the goods 
:ill sold, an Account-Sales must be made out and rendered to the consignor, 
which Account- Sales is an exact copy of his account on the Consignment 

Book. 

The person who ships the goods is called the consignor, and the person 
to whom the goods are consigned or shipped, is called the consignee. 

The consignee often sells on time unless he has advice from the consignor 
to the effect that he must sell for cash. If the consignee sells on time it 
is understood that he (the consignee) takes all risks in collecting the ac- 
count of the person to whom he sells. After the goods in a consignment 
have all been sold and an Account-Sales made out, if there were any time 
sales made the Account-Sales is then averaged, the date found upon which 
the net proceeds becomes due, and a note sent or draft accepted for the. 

amount. 

The consignor often makes sight drafts on the consignee " in round 
amounts," on consignments not yet entirely sold out ; these drafts are paid 
by the consignee, and of course charged to this account in the Ledger. 

The commission merchant often receives several consignments from the 
same person. Although but one account is opened in the Ledger, a sep- 
arate account must be opened for each consignment in the Consignment 
Book, and each consignment has a different number; yet each of these 
Consignment Nos. are identified as belonging to the same person. As 
these different consignments are closed out, the net proceeds of cadi are 
carried to the same account in the Ledger. The reason for keeping each 
consignment separate is, because the consignor wishes to know upon each 
consignment how much is lost or gained. 

25O. CLOSING COMMISSION BOOKS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. Un- 
like any other business, no Merchandise account being kept, the proceed- 
ings for closing the books in the commission business differ only in this 
one particular, viz.: no inventory of merchandise is taken, for the reason 
that the goods in our store do not belong to us. However, an inventory 
is made of the store and office fixtures, the insurance unexpired, etc., after 
which a Loss fc Gain account is opened, and all the accounts upon which we 
lose or gain are closed and carried into this account the same as in any other 
business. At the end of the year there are consignments which have nut 
yet been entirely sold out, and upon which there are, of course, gains to 
us for commission, etc.; all these charges thus due to us for commission 
on sales already made, insurance, storage, etc., may be, at the end of the 
year, debited to the consignments and credited to the different accounts 



COMMISSION BUSINESS. 

representing same. But this way of doing necessitates the making of ad- 
ditional charges when the consignments are closed out ; therefore, it is 
the custom to allow these consignments to remain untouched until then, 
for the reason that by doing otherwise it makes of them " complicated 
affairs " similar to that described under "Interest Receivable," 15!J. 

The commission merchant usually procures an insurance policy of a suf- 
ficient amount " to cover any goods he may at any time have in his store." 
When such a policy is procured, he opens an account in his Ledger and 
styles it " Insurance receivable," or some similar title, and to this account 
he debits the amount paid for premium on that policy. This is called a 
resource ; for to the consignor he charges a certain percentage for insur- 
ance, according to the time the goods remain in his store, this Insurance 
Receivable account receiving credit for such amount. At the end of the 
year, as heretofore stated, the value of the unexpired premium is approx- 
imated ; after which the Insurance Receivable account is closed the same 
as described in 188. There are some consignors who will not permit us 
to charge for " Insurance ;" but an arrangement is usually resorted to by 
the consignee through which he can, in spite of the consignor's protesta- 
tions, get in all his petty charges, such as insurance, " ratage," risks on 
on-account sales, etc., by charging a certain percentage under " Risks," 
" Charges," or some similar title. 

231. TRIAL BALANCE. In taking the trial-balance according to this 
method, we must not only take the accounts in the Ledger and the cash 
on hand as shown by the Cash Book ; but also, find the difference between 
the two sides of all the unclosed consignment accounts in the Consio-n- 
ment Book, and include all these accounts as well as the trial-balance. 

2.12. There are several different methods of keeping these consignment 
accounts, but the one here adopted is thought to be the best ; for there is 
no method by which the work can be lessened less writing done, less 
entries made unless it be a business in which they deal mostly in petty 
consignments, i. e., small consignments which they usually dispose of at 
one sale ; then the system and form described in 2-56 and 257 is recom- 
mended. 

253. Another Mttliod, Proceed according to method described in 247 
to 250 inclusive, with the following exceptions, viz.: 1st. When goods 
are received and charges for freight and drayage paid, instead of posting 
these charges directly to the consignor's account in the Consignment Book", 
an extra column is kept in the Cash Book for ' Charges." Into this 
column are extended all such charges, and at the end of the day, week or 
month, whenever the Cash Book is closed, the total of this column is 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

posted to the debit side of a " Charges " account in the Ledger this ac- 
count receiving credit for such charges when the consignments are closed 
out, as will be hereinafter described. The difference between the two 
side's of this account always shows the amounts owing to us for freight 
and cartage charges on consignments not yet closed out, and, therefore, is 
a resource. 2nd. When sales are made from a consignment on account, 
in addition to crediting the owner on the Consignment Book, a " Merchan- 
dise " column is kept in the Sales Book, and all sales are extended into 
this column ; at the end of each month the total of this column is found, 
and that amount is posted to the credit of a " Merchandise " account in 
the Ledger. An extra column is also kept on the debit side of the Cash 
Book for Merchandise, in which to extend all of the cash sales of the con- 
signments ; and, as in the Sales Book, in addition to crediting the consign- 
ments for such sales, the amounts of each are extended into this column, 
the total of same earned forward until the end of the month, and then 
posted to the credit of Merchandise in the Ledger. 3rd. When a con- 
8 i<rnment is sold out, the total amount of the sales of that consignment is 
posted to the debit of the Merchandise account in the Ledger; then all the 
charges, such as freight, drayage, labour, commission, etc., are entered on 
the debit side of the Consignment Book. The difference between the 
total of these charges and the total sales is now found, and that difference, 
bein" the net proceeds of the sales, is posted to the credit of the consignor's 
account in the Ledger; after which, the " Charges" account is credited for 
the freight and drayage charges, and each of our gain accounts, such as 
Commission, Labour, Storage, etc., is credited for the amount here entered. 
The difference between the two sides of the Merchandise account, as here 
used is a liability being the amount we owe on consignments not yet 
closed out. At the end of each month, when we take a trial- balance, we 
must go through the Consignment Book, and on such consignments as 
have not yet been closed out, find the total sales of each, and include all 
such amounts on the debit side of the trial-balance-these being amounts 
we owe to consignors for goods we have sold and not yet rendered Ac- 
count-Sales for, but which have been credited to Merchandise m the Sales 
Book The total of these amounts thus taken from the Commission Book 
should just agree with the difference between the two sides of the Mer- 
chandise account in the Ledger. 

The following forms will illustrate the different styles of rulings use 
by different commission merchants.

957. When Form No. 3, above shown, is used, the following described 
method is adopted, viz. : The books are kept by Single Entry. No record 
is made on this Consignment Book until the goods belonging to a consign- 
ment are all sold ; then the full record is here made, consisting of the date 
upon which the consignment was closed out, the Consignment No., the 
owner's name, address, and articles received, with weight, price realized, 
and the total amount for which sold, which amount is the total " Consign- 
ment Credit." Then the charges for freight and drayage are transferred 
from the Receiving Book into the columns here representing same, and 
our charges are made in the " Sundry " and " Commission " columns ; the 
total charges are now extended into the column representing same, which 
amount is the total " Consignment Debit." The difference is next found 
between the total charges and the total sales, that difference is extended 
into the " Net Proceeds " column to the personal credit of the consignor, 
and when remittance is made for the net proceeds thus credited, the con- 
signor is debited under the head of " Personal Debit." So this book is at 
once a Consignment Book and a Ledger in one ; i. e., instead of an account 
being opened with the consignor in the Ledger, his account appears here 
in the " Personal Debit " and " Personal Credit " columns. By adopting 
this method the totals of our " Sundry " and " Commission " columns may 
be found, at the end of each month, and the amounts thus gained posted 
to the credit of those accounts in the general Ledger. When we are re- 
ceiving several consignments from the same person, a page may be reserved 
for that person and all his consignments entered thereon ; and whenever 
he makes drafts on us " in round amounts" on his consignment account, he 
is charged under the " Personal Debit " for such of those drafts as we pay. 

258. When the method described in 247 to 251 is adopted, either of the 
forms 254< or 25.5 may be used. When an amount is posted to the credit 
side of the Consignment Book, the Sales Book page or Cash Book page 
upon which may be found the original entry of the sale is here inserted ; 
and when an amount is posted to the debit side of the Consignment Book, 
the Cash Book page upon which may be found the original entry for the 
freight and cartage charges is inserted. This same " folio " column is used 
in which to enter the Ledger page to which we post the credits for our 
charges for Commission, Insurance, etc.; and also the Ledger page to which 
is posted the net proceeds, it being thought unnecessary to make an 
entry on any other book before transferring these amounts to the Ledger, 
as the entry is perfectly clear to us and does not require any elaboration 
by way of a " Journal entry " before going into the Ledger. 



C80 THK HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

ti.">9. It will be seen, in Form No. 1, that no column is made on the 
" Sales " side in which to write the description of the articles the descrip- 
tion being already given under " Consignment;" thus all that is required 
under " Sales" is simply a column for the quantity of the articles sold. 
In Form No. 2 it will be seen that no column is made on the " Sales " side 
in which to write the name of the person to whom sold, it being thought 
of no concern to the consignor to whom we sell the goods, as we ourselves 
take all risk in the collection of the accounts, and, further, we do not 
want him to know who our customers are. An improvement might be 
made on both forms by consolidating the two having no column for the 
pei-son to whom sold, and having simply a column for the quantity not 
the full description of the articles ; with also a column in which to make 
a memorandum of goods sold on time, as shown in Form No. 1. 

260. Shipping merchants very seldom do exclusively a shipping busi- 
ness, bub carry on, in connection with same, a merchandise, and sometimes 
a little commission business. 

Commission merchants very seldom do exclusively a commission busi- 
ness, but, in connection with the same, buy and sell goods " out and out," 
and occasionally do a little shipping ; however, this fact of their doing 
" a little outside business," as they call it, they do not advertise to the 
persons who ship them goods to be sold on commission, in fact, they 
sometimes crack, if not break, the ninth commandment, when asked by 
a commission customer of theirs whether or not they handle any goods 
of their own. The person who is shipping goods to be sold on commission 
prefers to not send the goods to a commission merchant who transacts a 
merchandise business, and handles the same kind and class of goods ; for 
it is supposed that " human nature " will assert herself, and prompt the 
merchant to " push the sale of his own goods in preference to all others," 
and thereby delay the sale of the commission goods. It often occurs, 
however, that the commission merchant has an order for a certain kind of 
goods of which he has not a sufficient quantity remaining in a consign- 
ment to fill the order ; then, to satisfy his customer, he must go out and 
purchase a sufficient quantity to fill the order. Thi.s transaction is, of 
course, excusable, business-like, and just. 

261. When the different kinds of business Shipping, Commission, and 
Merchandise are by a merchant conducted in connection with each other, 
the shipping business must have its " Shipping Lo.'giT,' 1 or else a portion 
of the general Ledger be reserved for that purpose ; and the commission 
business must have its "Receiving" and " Consignment Books." Aside 
from these, the same set of books may be used for all the different kinds 



LOST ACCOUNTS AND NOTES.

of business. The Consignment Book is by some called a " Sales Book," 
but it should not bo so called. 

ACCOUNTS WITH ATTORNEYS. 



262. Debit for all notes and 
accounts we hand to them for col- j 
lection. 



263. Credit for all collections by 
them made and turned over to us, 
on such accounts and notes as we 
gave them for collection. 



264. EXPLANATION. Whenever we give or send an account or a note 
to an attorney for collection, we open an account with the attorney, and 
debit him for such note or account ; then credit the person's account, or 
the Bills Receivable account, for the amount, writing on the credit side 
of such personal or Bills Receivable account the name of the attorney to 
whom handed, adding " Att'y " after his name ; so that we may know, 
when we refer to such an account and see that it balances, that it is not 
balanced by payment, but by being handed to an attorney for collection. 
At the end of the year we require such attorneys to make a statement of 
the condition and probable worth of all such of our accounts and notes as 
they have in their hands, and we adjust the amounts to be carried there- 
from to the Lost Accounts and Notes account accordingly. The attorney's 
account is not balanced, but is allowed to stand as a resource, the same as 
any other personal account owing us. 



LOST ACCOUNTS AND NOTES. 



265. Debit, during the year, for 
amounts we lose on accounts and 
notes by persons going into bank- 
ruptcy, making assignments, etc., 
etc. 

266. Debit, at the end of the 
year, for approximated loss on 
worthless and part-worthless ac- 
counts and notes. 



267. Credit for amounts that 
are afterwards paid on accounts and 
notes which we had heretofore 
called worthless and debited to 
this account. 



THE HOME, FARM AND BL'SIXESS CYCLOP.EDIA. 

268. CLOSING. This account is closed the same as "Salaries" account. 

(See Z0) 

269. EXPLANATION. This account is kept in order to show, at the 
end of the year, how much we have lost during the year in poor accounts 
and notes. During the year we debit this account for all absolute losses 
on accounts and notes. 

270. ACCOUNTS. At the end ef the year, before closing our books, we 
take the Ledger, and beginning with the first account therein, go through 
the entire book, carefully examining every account. It is wrong to take 
in the trial-balance at the end of the year, as Resources, such accounts as 
we know to be absolutely worthless, and such accounts for their full face 
as we know to be worth only a small per cent, on the dollar ; therefore, 
when we come to an account we consider entirely worthless, we credit 
that account, in red ink, " By Lost Accounts and Notes" for the entire 
amount, balance the account thus closed, and carry the amount to the 
debit side of " Lost Accounts and Notes account," writing on the debit 
side of that account the name of the person upon whom the amount was 
lost. Such accounts as we think not entirely worthless we estimate the 
value of, credit same, in red ink, " By Lost Accounts and Notes" for 
amount considered worthless, and carry such amounts over to the debit 
side of Lost Accounts and Notes account. The accounts in the hands of 
attorneys are treated iu the same manner. 

271. NOTES. Having thus disposed of the accounts in the Ledger, we 
take the notes on hand (Bills Receivable) and examine them closely. 

we find any sve know to be worthless, we debit Lost Accounts and Notes 
account, and, in red ink, credit Bills Receivable account for such amounts 
putting all such notes in an envelope, on which we mark ' Worthies, 
Notes." If we find a note which we think is not worth its full face, we 
approximate the value thereof, and for the amount considered worthless 
we debit Lost Accounts and Notes account, and, in red ink, credit Bills 
Receivable account ; after which we may write on a slip of paper, " 
thrown oft' as worthless," with date, pin the slip on the note, and put 
with the notes considered good. 

272. When we thus, at the end of the year, carry LOB* 

and notes to this account, we do not transfer the amounts direct, as might 
be inferred from ivadin- thus far ; but we first make a journal entry 
with complete explanation accompany in..:, so that if we ever were ob 
to take our books into court to prove these accounts, they would in t 
entry show what these credits were. The journal entry here referre 
may be made in something of this manner : First, write the date at 



LOST ACCOUNTS AND XOTE3. 683 

top of the page, then below this write, " The following amounts on 
accounts and notes are this day by us considered worthless, and are, in 
consequence, here charged to Lost Accounts and Notes account." Under 
this heading make the journal entry thus : " Lost Accounts and Notes 
Dr. to Sundries ;" after which, first enter the names and amounts of all 
personal accounts called worthless ; then, the amounts called lost on 
accounts and notes in the hands of attorneys entering first the attorneys' 
names ; then, as an explanation, the names of the persons upon whom the 
accounts or notes are lost ; then the amounts called lost on our Bills 
Receivable writing first " Bills Receivable," then, as an explanation, the 
names of the makers of the notes, with date and time upon which the 
notes are drawn. We now find the sum total of all these doubtful 
accounts and notes thus sacrificed, and enter the same in the debit column 
on the same line with " Lost Accounts and Notes Dr. to Sundries ;" after 
which, we open a Lost Accounts and Notes account in the Ledger, and, 
in black ink, either post to the debit side of same the total amount thus 
lost in one entry, or copy from the Journal each name and amount. The 
latter is recommended as the better way, as we often have to refer to this 
account, and it is better to have in the Ledger an itemized record of the 
amounts lost on accounts and notes. After having thus posted the debit, 
we proceed to credit each of the accounts here specified, upon which 
these amounts were lost. We credit the accounts in red ink, so that such 
entries may be more conspicuous ; otherwise, in passing our eyes hastily 
over such accounts, we might think these amounts were payments. We 
may write on these accounts, as explanation, either " By Lost Accounts 
and Notes," or " Called Lost." It sometimes occurs that we carry an 
account along for several years, throwing off little by little at the end of 
each year, until finally " Patience ceases to be a virtue," and we " throw 
it all to the dogs." 

273. PAYMENTS. If a part of any of the accounts or notes which we 
had called entirely worthless should ever thereafter be paid, we credit the 
Lost Accounts and Notes account for such payments. When payments 
are made on any of the accounts or notes we called only part mrthless, 
we first credit the personal account or Bills Receivable, whichever it may 
be, until the amount which we called good is all paid, and afterwards we 
credit the payments to the Lost Accounts and Notes account. A memo- 
randum may also be made in lead pencil on the accounts, for payments 
on those which were by us called worthless. 

274. This account is finally closed, and carried into Loss and Gain 
account the same as any other upon which we lose. 



684 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 



Most business houses call this account " Suspense," but the title here 
used is thought to be more expressive. Some houses balance all the 
doubtful accounts, whether worthless or only part worthless, and carry 
the total amounts of such to the Suspense account; afterward debiting 
Loss and Gain and crediting Suspense for an approximated per cent, of 
the total amount thus carried to Suspense, and calling the balance of the 
Suspense a resource, or the amount thought by them collectible. Some 
of the smaller business houses carry the amount lost on poor accounts 
and notes direct to the Loss and Gain account. The system herein re- 
commended is thought to be better than either of these, for the reason 
that the amounts we know to be entirely worthless we at once call so, 
and make an entry accordingly; and of those accounts we think to l>c 
only part worthless, we carry amount thought worthless to an account 
representing the loss, and allow the amount called good to remain in the 
original account ; thus, instead of " flooding" our Loss and Gain account 
by carrying each of these accounts therein, we simply carry to the account 
the grand total of such loss.

276. Credit, at the end of the 
year, for all accounts upon which 
we have gained during the year 
writing here, in black ink, the names 
of the accounts upon which such 
<rains were made, and the amounts.' 



277. Directions for dosing the Loss & Gain account at the end of the 
year : 

1st. After all the accounts upon which losses and gains have been made 
are transferred, as directed in 275 and 27G, then find the difference between 
the two sides of this account. 

278. Closing No. 1. If the credit side be the larger, the amount the 
credit exceeds the debit is the net gain for the firm, or the net business 
gain. We then divide this gain among the proprietors, /*/<> rat'i or equally, 
according to agreement at commencement of business, and write on the 
debit side of this account, in red ink, the names of each of said proprietors, 

Private account" after each, and extending into the money 



LO3S AND GAIN. 685 

column the respective shares of the net gain. This having been done, the 
account will balance. 

279. If the debit side be the larger, the amount the debit exceeds the 
credit is the net loss for the firm, or the net business loss. We then divide 
this loss among the proprietors pro rata or equally, according to agreement 
at commencement of business, and write on the credit side of this account, 
in red ink, the names of each of said proprietors adding, after each, 
" Private account," and extending into the money column their respective 
shares of the net loss. This account will then balance. 

280. Closing No. 2. The same as Closing No. 1 in every particular 
excepting one that of adding " Stock account " after the names instead 
of " Private account." 

2nd. R,ule the closing lines and write the total amounts between these 
lines. 

281. 3rd. Closing No. 1. If there be a net business gain, carry over 
to the credit sides of the respective Private accounts of each member of 
the firm, the respective shares of such gain (as indicated in red ink on the 
debit side of this account) writing on the credit sides of these Private 
accounts, in black ink, " By \ Net Gain," or whatever the proportion may 
be. (See 61.) 

282. If a net business loss, carry over to the debit sides of the respec- 
tive Private accounts of each member of the firm the respective shares of 
such loss (as indicated in red ink on the credit side of this account) 
writing on the debit side of these Private accounts, in black ink, " To J 
Net Loss," or whatever the proportion may be. (See GO.) 

283. Closing No. 2. If there be a net business gain, the respective 
shares of such gain are carried direct to the credit sides of the respective 
Stock accounts of the members of the firm, instead of the Private accounts, 
as in Closing No. 1. (See oi.) 

284. If a net business loss, the respective shares of such loss are carried 
direct to the debit sides of the respective Stock accounts of the members 
of the firm instead of to the Private accounts., as in Closing No. 1. (See 53.) 

285. The difference between Closing No. 1 and Closing No. 2 is as fol- 
lows : In the former we carry from the Private accounts the net private 
loss or gain to the respective Stock accounts ; in the latter, we first carry 
the net business loss or gain from the Loss & Gain account to the respec- 
tive Stock accounts, and then we carry to the same (Stock) accounts the 
amount by each drawn out for private use, as shown by the Private ac- 
counts. 



THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

286. Single Proprietor. If there be but a single proprietor in the 
business, instead of carrying the net business loss or gain to his Private 
account, the Private account may be closed and carried over to the debit 
side of Loss & Gain account with the other a'ccounts upon which he loses, 
then the Loss & Gain account closed and his net private loss or gain, as 
shown by this account, carried to his Stock account. Otherwise, the ac- 
count may be closed as described in 277 to 285. 

287. EXPLANATION. Loss & Gain account, or Profit & Loss, as it is 
sometimes called, is an account kept to show the final summing up of all 
our losses and gains during the year. Some business houses make several 
entries to this account during the year, but it is the better way to carry 
the losses and gains into other accounts until the end of the year, and then 
to carry these accounts into the Loss & Gain account. (See 275 and 276.) 
A business man wants to know as often as once in twelve months, and 
sometimes oftener, how much he has gained or lost in his business. In 
order to ascertain this, it becomes necessary, first to take an inventory 
and then to " close the books." 

288. If the books are closed semi-annually, or oftener, the phrase " at 
the end of the year," heretofore used, applies to the time the books are 
closed, regardless of the actual end of the year. 



THE END OF THE YEAR. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CLOSING THE BOOKS.- 

289. First. Take an inventory of all the merchandise, store and office 
fixtures, real estate, buildings, unexpired insurance, unexpired taxes, etc., 
etc. Then close all these accounts as per instructions on each. (See 71, 
95, 100, 106, 155, 188 and 200.) 

-J9O. Second Sacrifice all the worthless and partly worthless accounts 
and notes as per instructions in 270 and 271. 

291. Tin rd Close all accounts in the Ledger upon which losses 01 
gains have been made, and transfer such losses and gains to the Loss ant 
( lain account. (See 275 and 276.) For full instructions, read paragraph) 
15 to 19, inclusive. A beginner, in closing books, frequently closes am 
carries over to the Loss and Gain account, accounts that he should not 
and does not close and carry to that account, accounts that he should 
hut, if he will thoroughly read paragraphs 15 to 19, and follow the in 
structions found therein, he will experience no difficulty in this line 






o 



THE EXD OF THE YEAR. 

We allow the Lost Accounts and Note.3 account to stand until the last. 
and finally close that account also, and carry it into the Loss and Gain 
account, 

'292. In closing the books at the end of the year, nothing mu-tt be left 
in the Ledger but Resources <<'/ Liabilities; and nothing must be carried 
into tie Lo** n.nd Gain account but Losses and Gains. (See Ledger 
under " The Corner Stone.") 

293. Fourth. Having thus carried over to the Loss and Gain account 
all the accounts upon which we have lost or gained, we find the difference 
between the two sides of this account, which difference is either our net 
business loss or our net business gain, we then dispose of that loss or 
gain according to instructions found in paragraphs 278 to 284. 

294. When a transaction is posted, the same amount is entered in the 
debit side of the Ledger that is entered in the credit side (see 28) there- 
fore, if no mistakes are made, the two sides of the Ledger, at the end of 
each month, should exactly agree. I say " at the end of each month," 
because there are very few houses who do not reserve the debit and 
credit to Merchandise until that time, and then post the total for the 
month in one entry to that account. They often have several extra 
columns in their Cash Books and Journals for different accounts, which 
necessitates but one posting per month to each of these accounts ; then, 
of course, the Ledger would not balance until all these totals were posted. 
By thus having these extra columns, double entry book-keeping is reduced 
to the simplicity of single entry, with very little additional labour. 

295. When we close an account, and carry the amount to some other 
account, we always cany the amount to the same side of the Ledger on 
which it ^las before ; therefore, the Ledger is never thrown out of balance 
by the closing of an account. For example : If the debit side of the Ex- 
pense account be the larger, we close this account, and carry the amount 
to the debit side of the Loss and Gain account ^ if the credit side of In- 
terest account be the larger, we close this account, and carry the amount 
to the credit side of Loss and Gain account.

THE TRIAL BALANCE. 

296. The Trial Balance the joy and delight (?) of every book-keeper! 
There is no rule or combination of rules with which a book-keeper can 
at once locate an error in his trial-balance. I wish there was, and that 
I were the sole possessor of that rule ; every book-keeper would then 
agree with me in this one fact, that I had, in the possession of that rule, 
an independent fortune ; for no book-keeper would be without it, even 
at a cost of $10. However, it may be well to give here a few hints with 
regard to rinding errors. 

297. In Round Numbers It the difference be in round numbers, 
as $10, $100, or $1,000, the error may have been made in addition or 
subtraction. 

// Divisible by 9. If the difference be divisible by 9, the error may 
have been made in the transposition of figures. 

If Divisible by 2. If the difference be divisible by 2, the error may 
have been made by posting an item representing just one-half the differ- 
ence to the wrong side of the Ledger. 

Aside from the above three, there may be " a thousand and one " rules 
with which to detect errors in Trial Balances, but they are all of no 
practical use ; for if the book-keeper, after having applied them all, still 
does not find the error, he is obliged finally to resort to the simple method 
of " checking off," and he then realizes that all the time spent on those 
" rules" was time thrown away, so it is better to proceed at once with the 

COMMON-SENSE METHOD OF DETECTING ERRORS. 

298. 1st. See whether or not the balance of cash on hand, as shown 
by the Cash Book, is taken in the Trial Balance. 

2nd See whether or not, on the Cash Book, Journal, and such other 
books as you post from, every debit and credit is checked as having been 
posted to the Ledger ; i.e., see whether or not, for every debit, a credit has 
been made for a like amount, and for every credit a debit. 

3rd See whether or not any mistakes have been made in addition, or 
in carrying forward the totals on the Trial Balance. 



THE TRIAL BALANCE. 



4th. Take the Ledger, and, from the beginning of the same, examine 
the addition and subtraction of every account, and if there be any accounts 
which have been balanced and carried forward to a new page, see whether 
the correct amount has been transferred ; and finally, see whether or not 
the proper amount is entered in the proper column on the Trial Balance. 

oth. See whether or not any mistakes have been made in addition, or 
in carrying forward the totals on the Journal. 

Cth and last, Examine the posting for the entire month from the be- 
ginning, seeing whether or not the proper amounts have been posted to 
the proper side of the Ledger. In thus examining the posting, it is well 
to check off in the Ledger, with a hard lead pencil, the itemsas soon as 
found to be correct. 

If the error is not found after the foregoing "programme" has been 
exhausted, there is no other recourse but to go over it again and again 
until the error is found. It sometimes occurs that a book-keepers-ill 
pass over an error several times before discovering it. 

399. The Trial Balance is simply a copy of the accounts in the Ledger. 
If the debit side of an account be the larger, find the difference between 
the two sides, and enter it in the left hand or debit column on the Trial 
Balance ; and if the credit side of an account be the larger, find the 
difference between the two sides, and enter it in the right hand or credit 
column on the Trial Balance. As the Trial Balance is neither more nor 
less than merely a copy of the Ledger, in the debit column there must be 
nothing but Resources and Losses, and in the credit column nothing but 
Liabilities and Gains. (See 41 and 42.) 

3OO. The monthly Trial Balance is taken simply to ascertain whether 
or not the books balance ; therefore, all that is necessary at the end of 
each month prior to the time when the books are closed, will be merely 
to take the figures to the Trial Balance, since it is a waste of time to 
write the names of all the accounts. (See 808 for this form.) Some 
business men require the book-keeper to write on the Trial Balance the 
names of all the accounts as well as the amounts, believing that by so 
doing the book-keeper cannot conceal any " ways that are dark and tricks 
that are vain ;" but this is a great mistake, for if a book-keeper is dis- 
posed to be "crooked," the most complete Trial Balance that ever was 
made would never exhibit the " crookedness." 

3O1. At the end of the year, before tlie books are dosed, the book- 
keeper ascertains whether his books balance by taking a Trial Balance 
in figures ; and after the books have been closed he takes a Trial Balance, 
writing the names of all the accounts, as well as the amounts. So a Trial' 
RR 



G90 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 



Balance consisting of the names, as well as the amounts, is made only 
immediately after the books have been closed. (See 810 for tins form.) 
There are many houses, however, that require such a Trial Balance 

end of every month. 

302 In adding the money columns in the Ledger, write the tota 
small figures in lead pencil, close under the last amount in the column 
bv so douvr it is never necessary at the end of each month to add 
of these amounts, but dimply to add the entries for the month includu 
the lead pencil totals, which amounts to the same as it would by add 
he entire column from the top. After the two columns have thus been! 
added simply subtract from one side to the other the lesser amount of 
these totals from the greater, and enter the difference in the explanation 
or wide column, on the side upon which is the greater amount whkl 
difference we transfer to the Trial Balance. (See 694 and 701.) 
difference is entered in the explanation column simply as a memorandum 
showin. the amount carried to the Trial Balance. Business colleges ha v, 
a their Trial Balances two columns in winch they enter the debit am 
credit total amounts, and two columns in which they enter the debit and 
credit dlferences, which makes a double Trial Balance, hence unnecessary 
work For these additions and substructions in the Ledger I would re- 
commend a " Faber HIIHH Drawing " pencil, as it is hard, and mak 

^SOS^After'the Trial Balance has been completed, a statement may be 
made in the firm's private record book, consisting of the present Ass 
and Liabilities ; the Losses and Gains for the year ; each member s pnval 
,ain or loss for the year, and his present worth ; together with 
fentage of the gross gain, as well as the net gain, to the sales for the ye. 

^oTpls^-DuE AccouNTS.-To all firms doing only a moderate busi- 
ness that do not draw for or settle by note their customer's account 
when due, the author would suggest that the book-keeper prepare, on t 
Irs of every month when he takes his Trial Balance, a list of the accounts 
tilt are long past due-entering, with the person's name and the amount 
he o-s, the "number of months that this account averages over -to*. 
Would recommend a book ruled in Journal form and labelled 
Accounts," for this use. This book or list he submits to the finn for 
Examination, when they decide what disposition shall be made o th 
accounts By so doing an account cannot stand several months past In,

might be lost. It is not necessary for the book-keeper to ascertain the 
exact average, but simply to look over the accounts and approximate the 



average 



RED INK PROMISES. 

3Oo. The red ink entries that are made in the Ledger, will, in this 
work, be styled, " Red Ink Promises," the reason for which will be clearly 
perceptible to the pupil after having read this article. Beginners in the 
practice of book-keeping frequently close an account in reef ink, and ne- 
glect to bring down or carry forward the balance ; and for such persons 
this article is prepared. With the single exception in par. 270 and 271, 
red ink entries are never made in the Ledger except when we wish to 
balance an account and bring down below the closing lines or carry for- 
ward to a new page the amount for a new account ; or. to carry the 
amount to some other account, or both, as is the case with the closing 
of the Merchandise account at the end of the year. Therefore, when we 
balance an account with a red ink entry, we promise that account that 
after having ruled the closing lines, we will dispose of its value as indi- 
cated in the red ink entry, in one or more of the following ways : 

1st. If the red ink entry be "By Inventory," we pronTise the account 
that we will, after having closed it, bring down on the debit side below 
the closing lines the value of that inventory. 

2nd. If the red ink entry be " By Loss & Gain " or " To Loss & Gain," 
we promise the account upon which we write this, that we will transfer 
to the Loss & Gain account the amount here indicated as lost or gained. 
3rd. If the red ink entry be "By Private account " or " Stock account,' 1 
or "To Private account" or "Stock account," we promise the Loss & Gain 
.account that we will transfer the net gain or loss to that account. 

4th. If the red ink entry be " By Balance" or " To Balance," we pro- 
mise the account that we will, after having ruled the closing lines, either 
bring down below these closing lines, or carry forward to a new page, the 
difference between the two sides of the account, as indicated in the red 
ink entry. 

306. Having closed an account with a red ink entry, we always carry 
forward or bring down the amount directly to the opposite side of the 
Ledger from that upon which the red ink entry was made. 

307. It these red ink promises are at all times fulfilled, the balance of 
the Ledger will never be affected by a red ink entry. On the other hand 
any failure on our part to fulfil any of these promises insures for us a

punishment when we take our Trial Balance at UK- end of the month; 
for we may then be obliged to .spend several hours in finding the account 
against which we "committed the offence." 

:50S. Jtidnncwg an account. When an account has filled a page and 
we wish to transfer it to a new page, we simply find the difference be- 
tween the two sides and close the account as follows : 

Credit. If the credit side be the larger, write on the debit side, in red 

ink, " To Balance," for the sum of the difference, which will make the 
account balance ; then rule the closing lines and write the total footings 
between the lines ; after which, open a new page for the account, and 
write on the credit side of that account, in black ink, " By Balance" for 
the balance brought forward writing on the old the page to, and on the 
new the page from which the account is transferred. 

Debit. If the debit side be the larger, write on the credit side, in ml 

ink, " By Balance" for the sum of the difference, which will make the 
account balance ; then rule the closing lines and write the total footings 
between the lines ; after which, open a new account and write on the 
debit side of that account, in black ink, "To Balance" for the balance 
brought forward writing on the old the page to, and on the new the page 
from which the account is transferred. 



ON FILING BILLS. 

8O9. When you enter your invoices only two or three times a month 
the author would recommend the following described method of filing 
them as the most economical, simple, and very best ; because an invoice 
may be found in this way sooner than in most any other. First arrange- 
the bills in alphabetical order, according to firm names; then each firm's 
bills in order of date; then enter them on the Journal under the Journal 
entry heading " Mdse. Dr. to Sundries ;" then get an " Emerson's File and 
Binder," letter size, or one similar, place a piece of heavy paper on the 
bottom about the size of a large sheet of letter-paper, after which file the 

bills the last letter in the alphabet first, and so on until you have them 

all in the file; then file another piece of heavy paper on the top, aft.. T 
which the volume may be taken from the file, and, after fastening, labeled 
in the following described way : First, " Invoices," then the month and 
year, and lastly the Journal No. and Journal page upon which these bill* 
were entered. For example : Invoices March, 1879 A. 124 and 125. 
Now, when these bills are posted to the Ledger, and we want to find a. 



DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING A SET OF DOUBLE ENTRY BOOKS. 693 

certain bill, we refer to the credit side of the firm's account in the Ledger 
and find the Journal page upon which the bill was entered ; then look for 
the file of bills which has on it this Journal page, when, as they are ar- 
ranged in alphabetical order, the bill may be easily found. When there 
are too many bills to get into one volume, divide and bind them in two 
or more volumes ; but never divide a page divide the bills according to 
the Journal pages, and not according to the number of bills. 



ON COPYING LETTERS. 

31O. In copying letters in a letter-book, get a set of good, clean blotters, 
throwing away the oil-board. A much clearer copy can be made by using 
blotters, and the copy is never so blurred and blotted that it can scarcely 
be read, as is often the case when oil-board is used. Use the blotters in 
the same manner as you used the oil-board. 



DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING A SET OF DOUBLE ENTRY 
BOOKS FOR A FIRM JUST STARTING IN BUSINESS. 

311. In opening a set of double entry books for a firm just startin^ in 
business, a statement of the actual assets and liabilities by each member 
invested should be made before an entry is made on the books. Then a 
separate entry should be made in the Journal for each member of the firm 
for such investment. When two or more persons first enter into a copart- 
nership business, under a certain firm name, the individual assets by each 
invested become the firm's assets ; and, therefore, the assets by each in- 
vested are debited to the firm's accounts representing assets ; and the in- 
dividual liabilities by each invested become thf firm's liabilities; there- 
fore, the liabilities by each invested are credited to the firm's accounts 
representing liabilities ; then the firm becomes indebted to each member 
of the firm for the amount that the individual assets by each invested 
exceed the individual liabilities; consequently, each member must be 
credited for the difference between his total individual liabilities and hi 
total individual assets. When the entries have been made in accordance 
with the foregoing remarks, the Ledger will balance and we may proceed 
according to the rules of double entry. (See 49 and 56.) For a complete 
illustration, see 347i to 3G9. 



(J94 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CHANGING A SET OF BOOKS FROM 
SINGLE ENTRY TO DOUBLE ENTRY. 

312. The proceedings for changing a set of books from single entry to 
double entry are as follows, viz. : 

1st. Take an inventory of all the merchandise, store and office fixtures, 
fuel, real estate, buildings, unexpired insurance, unexpired taxes, bank or 
other shares, and whatever other values the firm may have ; open an ac- 
count in the Ledger for each, and debit all such accounts for the total value 
of each as represented by the inventory. 

2nd. Open a Bills Receivable account in the Ledger and enter on the 
debit side of that account all the unpaid notes (that we call good) held 
against others. (See 107.) If the parties from whom we received these 
notes were not credited for such notes at the time they gave them to us, 
they should be credited when the Bills Receivable account is opened. 

3rd Open a Bills Payable account in the Ledger, and enter on the 
credit side of that account all the unpaid notes we have outstanding, made 
by us payable to other parties. (See 129.) If the parties to whom we 
<*ave these notes were not charged for such notes at the time they were 
by us given to them, they should be charged when the Bills Payable ac- 
count is opened. 

4 t h. Open a Cash Book and -enter on the debit side the total amount 
of cash on hand and in the bank ; then proceed with this book according 
to instructions in paragraphs 13 and 75 to 86. 

5th. Open such accounts in the Ledger as you wish to keep to show 
your expenses during the year, such as Expenses, Salaries, Advertising, 
etc., etc. (See 194.) 

gth. Open an Interest account in the Ledger and use it according to- 
instructions in paragraphs 144 to 1")4. 

7th. Now find the actual present worth of the firm by taking a Trial 
Balance, consisting of the names and amounts of all the accounts in the 
Ledger representing resources and liabilities, including the accounts just 
opened. In the single entry Ledger, as formerly kept, appear all the 
personal accounts owing to and by the firm which accounts would of 
course be included in the Trial Balance as a part of the firm's assets and 
liabilities. Having thus copied into the Trial Balance all the accounts in 
the Ledger representing resources and liabilities, we find the sums total 
of the two columns, and the amount the debit column (representing re- 
sources) exceeds the credit column (representing liabilities) is the ne 



ON TAKING IN A .NEW PARTNER. 095 

present ivorth of the firm which net present worth should exactly agree 
with the sum total of the value of all the members' Stock accounts. 

8th. Having made the sum total of the members' Stock accounts agree 
with the sum of the net present worth of the firm, the Ledger will balance, 
and we may then proceed according to the rules of double entry. 

313. Some firms adopt a system of book-keeping which is neither 
single nor double entry, but " betwixt and between." It is single entry 
with a few conveniences borrowed from double entry. For example : 
Many keep a Cash Book, an Expense account, so that they may see what 
their expenses have been during the year, and all keep Private accounts 
for each member of the firm, which they treat as described in paragraphs 
57 to 05. 

314. It is quite as easy to ascertain how much is lost or gained by the 
firm in the business by single entry as by double entry. In single entry 
the business man knows how much he is worth at the beginning of the 
year, and by taking an account of all his resources and liabilities at the 
end of the year, he may ascertain how much he is then worth the 
difference between the amount worth at the beginning of the year and 
the amount worth at the end of the year being the net gain, or the net 
loss. 

315. The phrase " at commencement of business," used throughout 
" The Foundation," may in every instance be applied to the entries made 
in changing a set of books from single entry to double entry. 



ON TAKING IN A NEW PARTNER. 

316. In taking a new partner into the concern, the strictly proper way 
to do is to close the books at the time the partner is received, in order 
that an exact statement of the present condition and worth of the firm 
may be attained ; a Trial Balance, exhibiting the same, may be made and 
submitted to the new partner for inspection, in order that there may be 
no misunderstandings. When this is done, the Ledger exhibits nothing 
on its face excepting those accounts which are either Resources or Liabi- 
lities ; and also shows the present net worth of each of the old partners. 
The new partner is then credited with his net investment ; after which, 
the gains and losses of the new firm are shared proportionately, according 
to mutual agreement. In illustration of this method, see 347| to 3G9. 

317. Some firms, in taking in a new partner, simply take an inventory 
and make a statement of the actual present standing of the old firm ; not 



G96 THE HOME, FAEM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

closing the books, but allowing all the accounts upon which losses and 
gains have been made to remain open until the end of the year. The 
former method is the better one, for the reason that there can afterwards 
be no dispute among the partners with regard to the relative individual 
standing of each at the time of the commencement of business under the 
new copartnership. 



INVESTMENTS. 

318. Investments are made in several different ways, a few descrip- 
tions of which are here given : 

1st. The partners invest equally, and share equally in the losses and 
gains. After the partners first enter into business their interests in the 
firm are constantly changing, so at the end of the first year, when the 
books are closed, there may be a wide difference between the then pre- 
sent worth of each. The partners who have the larger interest in the 
business sometimes require those who have the smaller to pay interest to 
them on the surplus capital ; but there are some who are more lenient 
with their unfortunate (but perhaps extravagant) co-workers, and do not 
require them to pay interest on the surplus. 

2nd. Capital is sometimes invested against Experience, the partner 
investing the money having no experience in the business in which he 
enters, and the partner having the experience investing no money. All 
the money invested is of course credited to the party who invests it, the 
party who has the experience sharing a certain proportion of the gains or 
losses of the firm. 

3rd. Partners sometimes invest unequally and share the gains and 
losses pro rata, according to investment. 

319. 4th. Interest on Surplus Capital. Partners sometimes invest 
unequally, and share the gains and losses equally, the partner investing 
the lesser amount paying the partner investing'the greater, interest on 
his surplus capital. When this is done, the partner who has the lesser 
amount invested pays to the partner who has the greater interest on 
only one-half of the difference, for the reason that it is the same in effect 
as borrowing so much money; and by borrowing an amount equal to one- 
half the surplus, lessens the investment of the partner who has the greater 
amount invested just that amount, and increases the investment of the 
partner who has the lesser amount invested the same amount, so that 
they then have an equal interest in the firm.

WHAT A BOOK-KEEPER SHOULD DO IN TAKING A SET OF 
BOOKS FROM ANOTHER BOOK-KEEPER TO KEEP. 

JJ'iO. In taking a set of books from another book-keeper to keep, you 
should first take a Trial Balance to ascertain whether or not the books 
balance. If they do not, the proprietors should be informed of the fact, 
and that they must be made to balance before proceeding. The next 
thing will be to look over the index to the Ledger and find out what 
other than personal accounts have been kept, so that you may know into 
what accounts Expense has been divided ; for in some houses Expense is 
divided into several accounts, such as Freight, Insurance, Advertising, 
Salaries, etc., etc., while in others all expenses are entered under one head- 
ing. If you come across an account you never saw before, and which is 
peculiar to this business only, you must ascertain for what that account 
is used. Examine all the books in use, in order to get an idea of the 
system practised prior to your taking charge of the books learning all 
you can from this system, and noting the points where improvements may 
be made. After this, ask for the notes held against others (Bills Receiv- 
able). Look over these notes and arrange them in order as they become 
due. If among these notes there are any having indorsers, you should 
not fail to present them to the makers for payment before three o'clock, 
P.M., on the day they fall due ; and if not paid upon presentation, to have 
them protested immediately before a notary public. Failing to do this, 
all the indorsers are released, and the firm may look only to the makers 
for payment, and if they be not able to pay, the notes are simply worth- 
less. In some States, however, it is not necessary to have notes bearing 
indorsers protested in order to hold the indorsers. The better way is to 
discount notes in the bank ten or fifteen days before due ; then, if they 
are not properly attended to, the bank is responsible. 



UNNECESSARY WORK TAUGHT IN THE BUSINESS COLLEGES 
AND PRACTISED BY MANY EXPERIENCED BOOK- 
KEEPERS, AND HOW TO AVOID IT. 

321. In many business colleges, students are taught to balance the 
Ledger accounts every month, and bring down the balances. This idea 
is absurd ; for in some business houses, where they have several thousand 
accounts, it would require a month's time for a book-keeper to do this 



698 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

wholly unnecessary work. Excepting at. the end of the year, when we 
close all accounts except those which represent Resources and Liabilities, 
we never close an account " To Balance" or " By Balance" until the page 
is full, and we wish to transfer the account to a new page (see 308) ; or, 
unless an account with a person be discontinued, and then, as this 
account balances, we simply rule the closing lines, and enter the totals 
between these lines. 

S'-J'-i. It is also unnecessary work to rule Ledger headings, although 
the Ledger looks a little better thereby, and it might be done when the 
book-keeper has plenty of spare time. When we do not rule Ledger 
headings for the accounts opened below the top ruling, we simply write 
the name of the account over the centre ruling, and proceed on the next 
line below with the entries. Some Ledgers are ruled for one, two, three, 
and four accounts to the page ; but it is better to have one common full- 
page ruling through the entire book, since by so doing we economize in 
Ledger paper, and have all the accounts together. When we open an 
account, we must calculate about how much space it may require, and 
allow so much spaca before opening another on the same page. Some 
accounts require several pages, while others require but a few lines. 

JS'-iT. Petty Accounts. We sometimes sell small bills of goods on 
account to city customers to persons who seldom buy of us except for 
cash. Not wishing to open an account with such persons, we enter all 
such names under a Ledger heading in the Ledger called " Petty Ac- 
counts." By so doing, the account takes up one line only. These accou 
need not be indexed, but instead we simply index " Petty Accounts ;" 
and anything we do not find in the index we will understand is to be 
found in the " Petty Accounts." We keep these Petty Accounts in the 
following manner : Under this title in the Ledger we post the entries 
thus : When we charge a person, we make the entry on the debit side of 
the Ledger writing first the date, next the person's name, then the 
Journal page, then the amount. When he pays this account, we write 
on the same line, on the credit side of the Ledger, opposite his name, the 
date, page, and amount. (See 736 to 746.) 

JJ28. Index Arm affluent of the Ledger Accounts. On opening a 
new Ledger in a wholesale business, it proves a great convenience to 
arrange the accounts alphabetically according to the towns leaving, after 
each town or city, a few blank pages for the new customers we may get, 
or the extension of the old accounts. When we arrange the Ledger ii 
this way it greatly facilitates posting, since we write the name of the 
city or town on the outer margin of the top of the page, and by knowin< 



UNNECESSARY WORK TAUGHT IN THE BUSINESS COLLEGES. 699 

the town in which the customer resides, his account is easily found with- 
out referring to the index. An index must also be kept in order, that 
\vi- may use it to find a name when we do not remember the town in 
which the person resides. Some firms index the towns, and not the per- 
sons' names. Should we have several accounts on one page, all belono-- 
ing to the same town, we need only write the name on the top of the 
page. 

In a retail business, the accounts may be arranged alphabetically, accord- 
ing to the names of the persons. 

329. On Committing the Pages to Memory. Some book-keepers who 
possess good memories commit to memory the account pages of almost the 
entire Ledger. In order that the pages may be more readily committed to 
memory, and that an account may be much more quickly found, I would 
recommend the following system for an index, which may be made from 
the index proper : Get a piece of heavy white cardboard, and from the 
index take the names of all such accounts as those to which a great many 
entries are made during the year, beginning with " A " in the index, 
write^these names in a bold, plain hand, arranging them in alphabetical 
form on this cardboard. Write the names of the accounts in ink, and 
afterwards add the pages in lead pencil. The object in writing the pages 
in lead pencil is, that they may be easily changed when the accounts are 
transferred to new pages. When posting, stand this card on the desk be- 
fore you, and you will soon become so familiar with the location of the 
names that you can instantly place your eye upon any name you wish 
and learn the page upon which the account may be found. 

330. Red Checks. When a page is filled and closed up, or balanced, in 
the Ledger, so that no more entries can be made on it, make a red check 
at the top, immediately over the centre ruling and under the name, to in- 
dicate that it is dead, " buried in oblivion " then, in taking the Trial 
Balance at the end of each month, when we see this red check at the top 
of a page we may pass it quickly by and not spend any time in examin- 
ing the page to see whether or not there is anything to be carried to the 
Trial Balance. Would recommend the use of this red-check system to 
indicate completion on all books such as Order Books, etc. 

331. On Entering Invoices. Among the smaller business houses very 
few enter the invoices (bills of goods they buy) oftener than twice a month; 
and there are a great many who enter them only once a month. When 
these bills are received, they are first checked to indicate that the goods 
have been received in good order ; then they are checked by the buyer to 
indicate that the prices are correct ; after which, the " figuring " is exam- 



700 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

ined, and if found to be correct they are marked " 0. K.;" then put away 
or filed in a safe place until the middle or end of the month, when they 
are entered in the manner described in paragraph 309. (See also 74 and 
401 to 407.) 

832. On Transferring Charges from t\M Sales Books or tJie Blotters to 
the Journal. When entries are transferred from the Sales Books or Blot- 
ters to the Journal before posting, the initials as well as the " & Co." may 
be omitted when there is but one person by that surname in the Ledger. 
For example: If you were journalizing an entry for F. B. & S. M. Hub- 
bard, and you had only one " Hubbard " in the Ledger, you would simply 
write " Hubbard" in the Journal, with the amount and the Sales Book or 
Blotter page ; or, if journalizing an entry for Scott, Thompson & Co., and 
you had no other " Scott " in the Ledger, you would simply write " Scott" 
in the Journal, and omit the balance of the name. The object of so doing 
being to save time in transferring the entries to the Journal ; and as the 
entries are (or ought to be) at once posted to the accounts in the Ledger, 
it answers the same purpose as though they were written in full. 

When there is more than one of the same surname, the name should of 
course be written in full ; or, when we get a new customer, at the time 
the first entry is made his name should also be written in full, together 
with his address.

Or, The Application of the Eules found in the Foundation. 



333. Although it is frequently said that no two business houses keep 
their books exactly alike, yet the underlying principles which govern the 
art of book-keeping are the same in all systems; therefore, when a person 
has thoroughly mastered book-keeping in one branch of business, lie is 
sufficiently qualified to take full charge of a set of books in any other 
business. When a business man asks you whether or not you have had 
say experience in book-keeping, he does not care to know whether or not 
you have ever kept books in his particular branch of business ; but simply 
whether you have had experience as a book-keeper. He does not expect 



THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE FOUNDATION*. 



701 



neither does he want you to plunge headlong into the work without first 
looking over the books, in order to get an idea of the system he has been 
using ; and then, unless you can suggest some improvements which are at 
once recognised by him as such, he expects you to conform to his ideas, 
and keep the books according to the old system. 

834. The business here chosen to illustrate the art of book-keeping, is 
that of the Retail Grocery. It is thought this business affords a sufficient 
variety of transactions to fully illustrate the points set forth in " The 
Foundation." The principles of double entry book-keeping may be as 
clearly illustrated with a small business, and small amounts, as with an 
extensive business, and large amounts ; therefore, it is thought best to il- 
lustrate here the smaller business, and the less cumbersome figures. In 
order to see the application of the rules in " The Foundation," the para- 
graph numbers should be referred to, whenever given throughout "The 
Illustration." 

333. The books used in this set are : Journal, Cash Book and Ledger 
Paragraph Nos. 12 to 21, inclusive, should now be read, and Nos. 20 to 48 
be committed to memory. The beginner should repeat, immediately before 
making each entry, this sentence : " Debit what we receive, and Credit 
what we give," and then make the entry accordingly. 

336. The First Half of the Month Here Illustrated. The first two 
weeks, the books are kept without Sales Books, all the sales beino- re- 
corded in the Journal. The employe's are paid their wages in full at* the 
end of each week, and consequently no accounts are kept with them 
(See 203.) 

337. The Last Half of the Month Here Illustrated. The last two weeks 
two Sales Books are kept, and are numbered " 1" and " 2," the on-account 
sales are transferred from these books to the Journal, as illustrated in para- 
graph Nos. 408 to 416. In business the sales are, of course, transferred to 
the Journal daily. (See 14.) The kind of Sales Books generally used in 
retail stores is small in size about 6x12 inches and 4 to 6 quires. These 
books usually lie on the counters during the day, when sales are recorded 
in them, and at night they are taken by the book-keeper, and all orders 
which have been filled and not marked "Paid" are transferred to the 
Journal in the manner illustrated in paragraphs 408 to 416. In the last 
half of this month the employe's do not draw their wages at the end of 
each week, but an account is kept with each employe", which is charged 
whenever any money is drawn, and credited at the end of the month "for 
the salary allowed. (See 204.) 



7(,-j THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

388. In order that " The Illustration " may be thoroughly understood, 
an explanation of same will be given to each entry : for the Journal and 
the Ledger, on the opposite page from the "Illustration"; for the Cash 
Book , on the pages following same. The " Ex." prefixed to a paragraph 
number "signifies, that what follows is an explanation of that which fol- 
lows the original paragraph number. 

339. The object in having the Journal ruled in the form here shown, 
instead of having the columns all at the right of the page, is: (1) By 
having the debits at the left and the credits at the right of the entries, 
the book-keeper is not so liable to post an item to the wrong side of the 
Ledger. (2) When a Journal entry is made, the debit and credit may 
both be placed on the same line, and thus economize in paper and make 
the entries more compact. (3) The book presents a better appearance in 
being thus arranged. 

3 1O. A Journal ruled in the common form may be used for this system 
by either ruling an extra money column on the debit side of the book and 
two L. F. (Ledger Folio) columns one on the left side and one on the 
right ; or, by dispensing with the " Mdse. Dr." column, and simply ruling 
the two " L. F." columns ; then, by using the column at the left which was 
originally intended for the date, for a " Miscellaneous Dr." column, writing 
the date in the centre of the page. If the latter method is adopted, the 
" Mdse." debit items must be entered in the " Miscellaneous Dr." column 
and posted to the Merchandise account in separate entries, the same as 
other debits are posted to their respective accounts. 

341. In order that the beginner in the practice of book-keeping may 
know -what entry to make, how to make it, and what explanation to write, 
it is thought advisable to insert here an

THE EXPLANATION OF THE JOURNAL. 

EXPLANATION OF THE JOURNAL OPPOSITE PAGE. 

THE COLUMNS. 

Ex. 342 and 347. These are the columns referred to in paragraph 12 
In the Mdae. Dr. column is entered all merchandise bought by us and re- 
turned to us; and in the Mdse. Cr. column is entered all the merchandise 

I by us, and returned by us to other parties. (See 67 to 70.) 
Ex. 343 and 346. These are the columns referred to in paragraphs 39 
tO. All debits which are not Mdse. debits are entered in 343 column 
and all credits which are not Mdse. credits are entered in the 346 column' 
/-7i posting, we post only tlie items found in these columns. 

Ex. 344 and 345. These are the columns referred to in 32.5 and 340 

When we have posted an item to the Ledger, we indicate the pa*e to which 

t is posted in these columns. So it will hereafter be understood what the 

figures in these columns indicate. These figures also show the book-keeper 

where he ended his posting. 

Ex. 347*. In order that the beginner may be prepared to "encounter" 
any set of books that is presented to him, it is thought best to give here a 
seemingly complicated example. When partners first enter into business 
they usually invest all cash, or cash and note-the entry then is a very 
simple one, and is made in the manner represented in paragraphs 367 368 
19; but, when one of the partners has been engaged in business and 
m a partner, the entry then is more difficult and complicated such 
an example is here presented. Goodwin has been engaged in the Retail 
Grocery Business, and on the first of December, 1880, takes in as a part- 
S. A. Emerson. The proceedings for opening the books for the new 
arm, are described in paragraphs 311, 316, 317 and 49. In changin* a set 
! books from single entry to double entry the entry in the Journal would 
s made in the same manner as the example here illustrated, with the ex- 
ception of the personal accounts, which amounts would already appear in 
the Ledger and of course would not require posting unless a new Ledger 
was opened then they would have to be transferred. It is presupposed 
th,s set, that when the new partner (Emerson) is taken in, a new set of 
books will be opened; hence all of Goodwin's old aocounts are transferred 
to the new Ledger.

THE EXPLANATION OF THE JOURNAL. 

Ex. 398. This firm buys of us empty boxes, and as the cases or boxes 
are usually charged to us on the bills of goods we buy, and are conse- 
quently entered by us as merchandise, we must now credit Merchandise. 
Posted to 776. 

Ex. 399 and 400. Frank Burgess, our customer, is a carpenter, and we 
employ him to make for us some new shelving, for which shelving we 
allow him $4. This amount he wishes credited to his account, so we 
debit Store and Office Fixtures, and credit him. 399 posted to 596- 
400 posted to 726. 

Ex. 401 to 407. It is now the middle of the month ; therefore, we 
take the invoices which have accumulated since the first, arrange them in 
alphabetical form, and enter them in the manner here illustrated. The 
jj__o and "JLJp/' i n paragraph 402, is but an abbreviated way of 
indicating Dec. 2nd, 1880, 814.60, and Dec. 13th, 1880, 85.25, these being 
the dates and amounts of bills we bought from Arinsby. We sometimes 
enter a great many bills for a firm, and this way of entering them, is then 
found to be a great convenience, as much time and much Journal paper 
is saved by so doing. (See 460 for a better example.) When there is 
only one bill, we simply write the day of the month on the end of the 
line, as in 403, for Dec. 3rd, i.e., if the bill is dated in the present month; 
but if dated in the previous month, we indicate the month and day as in 
paragraph 406 for Nov. 28th. If the time on which the goods were sold 
is given, we add the same after the name, as in paragraph 403, etc. After 
the bills have all been entered, we find the sum total of them, and enter 
that amount to the debit of Merchandise in the " Mdse. Dr." column. 
(See 309, 331, and 175.) 402 to 407 posted to 766, 767, 750, 759, 778* 
779, 750, and 783. 

Ex. 408 to 416. These are charges transferred from Sales Books 1 and 
2, referred to in paragraph 337. It is not thought necessary to give, in 
this work, the form of the Sales Book, as an entry made in this book is 
made in precisely the same form and manner as in paragraph 370, and 
when transferred to the Journal, simply the amount, person's name, 
number of Sales Book and page is taken. When we wish to refer to an 
original charge, we turn to the Journal, and here find the book (Sales 
Book) and page upon which the sale is recorded. In this example, 409 
to 412 are transferred from Sales Book 1, and 413 to 416 from Sales 
Book 2, the pages upon which such charges are made being added. 
(See 14.) Having entered all the charges from the Sales Books, we find 
the sum-total of them all, and credit Merchandise in the " Mdse. Or."

column for the amount. 409 to 416 posted to 724, 578, 737, 709, 716, 
738, 692, and 734. Paragraphs 411 and 414 are petty accounts referred 
to in paragraph 327. 

Ex. 417 and 418. Fisher's note was due on the 14th instant, but he 
failed to pay it, and, as there seemed to be poor prospect of our collecting- 
the account, we hand it over to our attorney, Richardson, for collection 
This note was debited to Bills Receivable account, so we now credit Bill* 
Receivable, and debit Richardson. (See 262 and 264.) 417 posted to 
684. 418 posted to 621. 

Ex. 419 and 420. Russell, the farmer, sent to Armsby, the commission 
merchant, cheese to be sold on commission, with instructions to pay the 
proceeds of the sales of same to us. As we are owing Armsby & Co., 
they render to us an account -sales, and request us to give Russell credit 
for the amount of same. We then debit Armsby and credit Russell. 
419 posted to 763. 420 posted to 712. 

Ex. 421 to 425. Russell's note of November 18th, at 30 ds. for 8200, 
3 now due. On December 3rd he paid 850 on this note. (See 488.) 
He is now unable to pay the balance, and wishes to give us two notes for 
the balance of the old (8150), and the interest on same to date (81.27), 
and the balance of his account in the Ledger (826.96). We take from him 
the new notes (see 425), and surrender to him the old note. 421 posted 
to 610 and 611. 422 posted to 624. 423 posted to 667. 424 posted to 
713. Another way of recording this transaction would be to debit Rus- 
sell's account for the balance due on the old note surrendered and interest, 
and then credit his account for the new notes he gives us. If this method 
were adopted, the entry would then be as follows :- 

151.27 Ed Russell Dr. to Sundries, 

Bills Receivable, 8150.00 

Interest, 1.27 

Surrendared note of Nov. 18-8230 ds. 

8200. Payment on same, 50. 

178.23 Bills Receivable Dr. to E. Russell, 178.23 

Rec'd following-described notes : 
Dec. 21-82 30 ds. 100.00 
" " CO " 78.23 

Ex. 426. Same as 408 to 416. After a customer's name has become 
familiar to us, and we have only one person by that surname in our 
Ledger, we omit the initials, as in this example. (See 332.) It is not 
necessary to ditto the Sales Book page ; but we understand that it is the 



THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

same as above until changed. Piper, Dickenson, Goodwin, and Cameron 
are petty customers, and these amounts are posted under " Petty Ac- 
counts." Lyman and Keene are new customers, therefore residence is 
added. It is not thought necessary to indicate where the amounts in 
this example are posted, as the student by this time has sufficient know- 
ledge of posting such charges. 

Ex. 427 to 430. When goods are frequently returned to us, it is ad- 
visable to keep a " Credit Book " in which to enter these credits. When 
this is done, we simply write in that book the person's name and a 
description of the goods returned ; then those credits are transferred to 
the Journal in the manner here indicated entering the person's name, 
C. B. for Credit Book, the page and amount. 428 posted to 697. 42E 
posted to 730. 430 posted to 720. 

Ex. 431 and 432. We give Borland, whom we are owing, an order on 
Bennett (a dry goods merchant), who is owing us, for dry goods to the 
amount of $20, with instructions to Bennett to charge the same to our 
account. This is to us the same in effect as giving Borland a sight 
draft on Bennett, so the entry is made the same as in paragraphs 4 
ant l 44.0 the explanation only being different. 431 posted to 777. 432 

posted to 698. 

Ex. 433 and 434. We are owing S. W. & Co., and they are owir 
Thompson & Risley. They draw on us at 30 days from Dec. 20th, mak- 
ing the draft payable to T. & K, and we accept it, thereby promising to 
pay T. & R in 30 days, for S. W. & Co., 828.45. (See 182 and 
433 posted to 782. 434 posted to 638. 

Ex. 435, 436, and 437. Porter cannot pay his note, which is now due, 
therefore renews it for 30 days, giving us a new note for the amount .,f 
the old note and interest. When he gives us the new note we surrender 
to him the old. This, also, may be treated according to the other methoc 
described in Ex. 421 to 425. (Lee 124.) 435 posted to Gl 3. 436 pos 
to 625. 437 posted to 668. 

Ex. 438. Same as 408 to 416. 

Ex 439 and 440. Dollus is owing us and we are owing Armsly, : 
crive Armsby a sight draft on Dollus. If sight drafts are not paid whod 
drawn by us on one person payable to another, and are returned to us, we 
are then obliged to undo the entry we made when the draft was drawn 
which would be done by debiting the person on whom we drew, anc 
crediting the person to whom we made the draft payable.

THE EXPLANATION OF THE JOURNAL. 715 

Ex. 441 and 442. We hear that Dorman is about to fail ; therefore, 
we make a certified statement of his account, and hand it to our attorney 
for collection. " What is meant bya certified statement ? " A certified 
statement is an itemized statement of a person's account made out and 
sworn to by us before a notary public as being " correct, to the best o 
our knowledge and belief." (See 262 and 264.) 441 posted to 685. 442 
posted to 735. 

Ex. 443 to 446. We are owing these different parties. We send 
Arbuckle and Babbitt notes on 60 and 30 days from the dates of their 
bills, as indicated in paragraphs 444 and 445 ; and we accept the draft 
drawn on us by the Toronto Tobacco Co. at 60 days from Nov. 28th, as 
indicated in paragraph 443. The entry for these is the same in effect as 
were the entries in paragraphs 380, 381, and 396, 397, excepting that 
here we make an entry for several notes, and in those cases, for only one 
at a time. The items are posted separately on the Bills Paj'able account 
for checking purposes. 443 posted to 639, 640, and 641. 444 posted to 
755. 445 posted to 758. 446 posted to 748. 

Ex. 447, 448, and 449. Some book-keepers hold the notes they receive 
several days before entering them, and then enter them all together in the 
manner here illustrated. Each of the parties is then credited, and Bills 
Receivable account debited for each item separately. 447 posted to 614 
and 615. 448 posted to 727. 449 posted to 731. 

Ex. 450 and 451. Hurto is insolvent, and compromises with his 
creditors for a settlement in full for sixty cents on the dollar, i.e., each 
one of his creditors signs a paper which is presented to them agreeing to 
accept sixty cents on the dollar in full settlement. Hurto then gives us 
a check for 97.50, which is 60 per cent, (entered on Cash Book see 500), 
and the remainder, 865 (40 per cent.), is of course lost. (See 265.) 450 
posted to 784. 451 posted to 600. 

Ex. 452. Same as 427 to 430. Posted to 700. 

Ex. 453 to 457. For full instructions and explanations, see latter part 
of paragraphs 336 and 337 ; also 201 and 204. 453 posted to 654. 454, 
5, 6, and 7 posted to 677, 679, 681, and 683. 

Ex. 458 to 463. Same as 401 to 407. When several bills are bought 
from a firm on different time, the time on which each is bought is indicated 
in the manner illustrated in paragraph 460. For example: "ZIT^TT" is 
Dec. 15, 820.00 on 60 days' time. Posting same as Ex. 401 to 407.' 

Ex. 464 to 468. For full instructions and explanations, see paragraphs 
266, 270, 271, and 272. Dollus having suddenly " left for parts unknown," 
we call his account lost. Lyman having recently failed, his note is con- 



71 C THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

sddered by us as worthless. Our attorney reports that of the remaining 
$50 due on Dorman's account, he believes not more than $25 to be 
collectible, so we carry $25 to Lo$t Accounts and Notes. 465 posted 
to 785, 786, and 787. 466 posted to 722. 467 posted to 626. 468 
posted to 687. 

Ex. 469 and 470. Having carried forward the Merchandise debit for 
the entire month, we now post the total amount for the month to debit 
of the Merchandise account in the Ledger (see 586) ; a$d having carried 
forward the Merchandise credit for the entire month, we now post the 
total amount for the month to the credit of the Merchandise account in 
the Ledger. (See 590.)

720 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

EXPLANATION OF THE CASH BOOK ENTRIES ON THE 
TWO PRECEDING PAGES. 

THE COLUMNS. 

As indicated at the top of the respective columns, 471 and 478 are the 
" Date " columns ; 472 and 479 are the " L. F.," or " Posting " columns, in 
which to write the Ledger page to which an item is posted. 

Ex. 475. This the " Miscellaneous," or " General" column, in which is 
entered all cask received (except for cash sales of merchandise), all items 
entered in this column are credited to the respective accounts indicated 
under 473. (See 13, 43, and 45.) 

Ex. 476 This is an extra column kept in which to enter the merchan- 
dise cash sales. The object in thus extending the cash sales into this 
column is to save labour in posting ; for by so doing, it is necessary to 
post the Merchandise cash sales only once a month, crediting Mdse. at 
the end of the month for the total sales for the month, as shown by the 
total of this column. (See 547.) When the Cash Book is closed daily, 
this column cannot be used, then the cash sales items are entered in the 
"Miscellaneous" column, and we are obliged to post the same to the 
Merchandise account daily. 

Ex. 477. This is the " footing," or " total " column, into which is ex- 
tended the balance of cash on hand in the morning, and the total received 
during the day, at night. (See 485 and 548.) 

Ex. 482. This is the " Miscellaneous," or " General" column, in which 
is entered all cash paid out (except for items belonging to the Expense 
account), all items entered in this column are debited to the respective 
accounts indicated under 480. (See 13, 44, and 46.) 

Ex. 483. This is an extra column kept, in which to extend all items 
to be debited to the Expense account. This is kept for the same reason 
that any extra column is kept to save labour in posting, the total of 
this column being posted to the debit of the Expense account at the end 
of the month. (See 550.) When the Cash Book is closed daily, it is 
scarcely advisable to keep this extra column, as there are seldom enough 
entries to the Expense account to pay for keeping it, the Expense items 
are then entered in the column with the miscellaneous items, and posted 
daily to the Expense account. 

Ex. 484. This is the credit " footing " or " total " column, into which 
is extended, every night, the total amount of cash paid out during the 



EXPLANATION OF THE CASH BOOK. yoj 

day, and the balance of cash remaining on hand at night. (See 551 
and 552.) 

Ex. 473 and 474. When we receive cash, we write the name of the 
account we are going to credit for that amount under 473, and if any 
explanation be required, we write it in as few words as possible under 
474. 

Ex. 480 and 481. When we pay out cash, we write the name of the 
account we are going to debit for that amount under 480 ; and if any 
explanation be required, we write it in as few words as possible under 
481. 

THE ENTRIES. DEBIT SIDE. 

Ex. 485. When the Cash Book is closed daily, we bring down on the 
debit side, each morning, the amount of cash on hand for the beginning of 
the day's business in the manner here illustrated, always extending the 
amount into the outer column. 

Ex. 486 and 487. No entry is made of the cash sales in the Cash Book 
until the close of the day, and then Merchandise is credited for the total 
sales of the day in one entry, as here shown. When an extra column is 
kept, it is advisable to make a check in the " L. F." column opposite all 
items for that column, so as to leave no blank lines whereby the 03-0 
might be confused in posting. 

K\. 488. Russell pays us $50 on his 30-days' note of Nov. 18th, which 
amount we endorse on the note. (See 109.) Posted to G18. 

Ex. 489. If we are in need of money, we take a note to the bank and 
get it discounted, the entry is then made in this manner. This note is 
mad.' without interest, so the bank deducts 85 cents (see 509) and hands 
us the balance, or gives us credit in our bank book, for the same. They 
deduct the discount at a certain per cent, per annum for the time the note 
has yet to run before due in this case 8 per cent, for 19 days. We must 
in all such cases credit Bills Receivable for the full face of the note, and 
debit Interest on the opposite side of the Cash Book for the discount.

722 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

E X . 492. On the 6th instant we draw on Miller at sight, through our 
bank, for the amount of his account. Our bank this day advises us that 
the draft is paid, and enters in our bank book the amount to our credit. 
We now add this to the amount we have on deposit in the bank on the 
stub of our check-book, which is the same in effect as making a deposit of 
that amount. (See 170, 74, and 143.) Posted to 703. 

Ex. 493 and 494. The note which Smith gave to Emerson on Nov. 
14th, at 30 days, for $1,000, and was by Emerson endorsed over to the 
firm on Dec. 1st, is now due. Smith is unable to pay more th;in 8500 
and the interest accrued to date $7.33 ; he therefore wishes to renew 
the remaining $500 for 15 days. He pays $507.33 cash, which is entered 
in the manner indicated in 493 and 494, and then writes a new note for 
8500 at 15 days, gets the same person he had on the old note to endorse 
for him, and hands this note to us ; we then surrender the old note. No 
entry need be made for the new note ; but it may be allowed to appear 
in the books as so much still remaining unpaid on the old note, the only 
record of the renewal being made in the Bills Receivable and Bills Pay- 
able Book. [See 124 and 153.) Posted to 622 and 665. The object 
in taking a new note instead of endorsing the payment on the back and 
holding the old note, is in order that we may use the new, to get it dis- 
counted if we wish. 

Ex. 495 and 496. This note is made with interest, and as the rate per 
cent, is satisfactory to the bank, instead of deducting a discount, they 
allow us for the interest which has already accrued on the note to date, 
and give us credit for the face of the note $200 and this accrued inte- 
rest 76 cents. The interest is in this case calculated from the date of 
the note to the time it is discounted, from Dec. 3rd to Dec. 20th 17 
days. (See 125.) Posted to 623 and 666. 

Ex. 497, 498, and 534. We sold Bennett and Cameron goods on Dec. 
17th and 2lst, on terms 60 days, or 2 per cent, off for cash within 6 days, 
On Dec. 23rd, they deduct 2 per cent, from their bills, and pay us the 
balance. We give them credit for the full amount of the bills, and debit 
Merchandise on the opposite page. (See 534 and 74.) 497 and 498

CREDIT SIDE. 

Ex. 506. We give our landlord a check for the month's rent of our 
store. A " Rent " account is sometimes kept, so as to show how much 
has been expended during the year for rent ; but in this case it is carried 
into the Expense account. (See 190 and 194.) All items we wish charged

Ex. .-,17. We purchase five bank shares of the Union Trust Co. stock. 

We buy these because we have money to spare, and think it a good in- 
vestment as this bank declares a semi-annual dividend to its shareholders, 
the per cent, of which amounts to more than our money would bring if 
put out on interest. When we receive cash on a dividend we open a 
" Union Trust Co. Dividend" account, and credit that account for the 
amount of the dividend ; which " Dividend " account is closed at the end 
of the year and the amount carried to the Loss & Gain account as a Gain.

CLOSING THE CASH BOOK. 

Ex. 547. It is now the end of the month, and we wish to close or bal- 
ance the Cash Book. First. Find the total of the " Mdse. Cr." column, 



726 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

then bring that total into the " Miscellaneous Or." column, which amount 
is the total sales for the month. 

Ex. 548. Second. Find the total of the " Miscellaneous Cr." column, 
(including the Mdse. Cr. amount) the amount of which is the total cask 
received during the month, and this amount is then extended into the 
" Total" column. 

Ex. 549. Third. Add the amount on hand at the beginning of the 
month, $3,000, and the total received which gives the total Cash debit. 

Ex. 550. Fourth. Find the total of the " Expense Dr." column and 
bring the total into the " Miscellaneous Dr." column. 

Ex. 551. Fifth. Find the total of the " Miscellaneous Dr." column, 
which amount is the total cash paid out during the month, or total Cash 
credit. 

Ex. 552. Sixth. Find the difference between the total Cash credit 
(551), and the total Cash debit (549), which difference is the balance of 
cash remaining on hand. Now write, in red ink, " Balance on hand " 
and extend the amount into the " Total " column under the total amount 
paid out. 

Ex. 553. Seventh. Add the total paid (551), and the balance now on 
hand (552), and place the total below (553), which total should just agree 
with the total on the opposite side of the Cash Book. 

KULlNO. The red lines should first be ruled in the manner here illus- 
trated. The double red lines should always extend across both pages on 
the same line ; therefore we always rule first the page that extends the 
lowest down, then rule the opposite page to correspond. 

E X 554, After the Cash Book has thus been balanced, we bring down 
on the debit side of the book the balance of cash on hand for the beginning 
of the new month. We then proceed in the same manner as in the pre- 
ceding month. 547 posted to 589. 550 posted to 645. 

REMARKS. When there are a great many entries in the Cash Book 
every day, it is advisable to balance it daily ; then the extra columns, 
" Mdse. Cr." and " Expense Dr." could not be used. When they are not 
used, there are but two money columns on each side of the Cash Book, 
in reality, a common Journal ruling. The items that are here entered 
in the extra colums would then be entered in the inner, or general 
column, and the book would be otherwise treated the same as though 
these columns were here stricken out the Mdse. and Expense items 
being posted to their respective accounts the same as the other items.

730 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

EXPLANATION OF THE LEDGER. 

THE COLUMNS. 

Ex. 555 and 559. These are the date columns. The dates entered 
herein are taken from the Journal and Cash Book, or whatever books we 
post from. 

Ex. 556 and 560. These are the " explanation columns " referred to in 
323 and 324. 

Ex. 557 and 561. These are the columns in which we indicate the 
Journal or Cash Book pages from which a transaction is posted or trans- 
ferred. By thus entering on an account the Journal or Cash Book page 
upon which a transaction may be found recorded in detail, it is not neces- 
sary to write any explanations on this book, excepting the few instances 
that will be noticed on the accounts herein. 

Ex. 558 and 562. These are the debit and credit money columns. 

Now read Par. 15 to 19 ; also 321 to 330. 

THE ACCOUNTS. 

Ex. 563 to 570. See 49 to 56. (This set of books is closed according to 
Closing No. 1.) It will be seen that Goodwin has a net private gain > 
while Emerson has a net private loss : thus illustrating to the student the 
different ways of treating the Stock accounts in such cases. 

Ex. 571 to 583. See 57 to 65. It will be seen in 575 and 582 that 
each of the partners is credited with equal shares of the net business gain. 
Goodwin has drawn less (571, 2 and 3) for his private use than his net 
business gains amounted to, therefore he has a net private gain (See 62). 
It does not matter whether or not a salary is allowed the account is 
treated the same, as will be seen in this case where none is allowed. 
Emerson has drawn more for his private use than his net business gain 
amounted to, therefore his is anct private loss. (See 63.) 

Ex. 584 to 59L See 66 to 74. 

Ex. 591 to 600. See 92 to 96. 

Ex. 601 to 628. See 322. In business colleges 601 is the style of . 
ruling that is used under the Ledger headings. Some book-keepers also 
use this ; but if any ruling is used the style under " Bills Payable (628; is 
recommended, as it requires less time to rule it and is not so " fussy." 
These rulings are used here simply to show the different styles. 

Ex. 602 to 027. See 107 to 128. Some book-keepers do not insert the 
two ciphers in the " cents" column in their books when there are no cents

but leave the column blank as has been done in this Bills Receivable ac- 
count. When an item is posted to this account, do not write in that 
formal business -college way "To Ed. Russell" when a note is received, or 
" By Cash" when it is paid ; but simply write as in G02 and CIS the person's 
surname (Russell), the month in which the note is dated, (llth or Nov.) 
the number of days upon which it is drawn (30), the page (02), and the 
amount (200). And when a payment is made on this note, write on 
the credit side of the account when the item is posted, the name, month, 
days, page and amount, the same as on the debit side adding after the 
days " P.," " D." or " R.," so that we may know whether " Payment," 
" Discounted," or " Renewed." This is all done simply for checking pur- 
poses, in case that the difference between the two sides of the account 
should not agree with the total value of the notes we actually have on 
hand. (See 128.) For explanation of 626, see 271. 

Ex. 629 to 643. See 129 to 140. The explanation columns are treated 
in this account in the same manner and for the same purpose that they 
arc treated in the Bills Receivable account, the names, etc., being entered 
simply for checking purposes. (See 139.) It is not neccessary to ditto the 
month in the explanation column but to allow it to stand until changed 
as in 635 to 641. The Bills Receivable and Bills Payable accounts are 
usually balanced in the manner here illustrated only when the page is full

of the year, at which time it is customary to close them and bring down 
the balances in this manner. (See 308.)

811. This is the Trial Balance with the names of the accounts, referred 
to in 301. This kind of a Trial Balance is a sufficient "Balance Sheet" (see 
latter part of paragraph 303) to satisfy any business man ; but as such a 
Trial Balance is required only once a year, the book-keeper can well af- 
ford to spare time enough to make out for the firm a " Yearly Statement " 
in the manner hereafter illustrated, which cannot help but prove suffi- 
ciently clear and plain to satisfy the most fastidious. (See 812 to 818.) 
In taking the above Trial Balance, it will be seen that the personal ac- 
counts from the Ledger are first taken, then the cash balance from the 
Cash Book, then the remaining accounts in the Ledger, last of ail the 
partners' Stock accounts. (See 296, 297 and 298.) After the Trial Bal- 
ance has been taken the Yearly Statement is then made, the items of 
which are taken from the Trial Balance for the Assets and Liabilities (see 
812), and from the Loss & Gain account in the Ledger for the Losses and 
Gains. (See 813.) The Partners' Individual Statements are made from 
the Stock and Private accounts of each of the partners. (See 814.)

816. In order to present to the firm, in a compact form, a statement of 
the monthly sales, in such a way that the sales for one month or year may 
be compared with the sales of another, the above form is recommended. 
This form is continued in length for the twelve months of the year, and in 
width for as many years as there can be money columns made on the 
page ; or if begun on the left hand page of the book, it may be extended 
across both pages. When this statement is made, the total sales (cash and 
on account) are, at the end of each month, here recorded. A statement of 
the firm's Expenses may be made in the same manner ; but this requires 
more labour, as it necessitates the making, first, of an itemized statement 
of the expenses.

818. The foregoing is a statement easily made, and proves one of great 
importance and satisfaction to the business man ; since he can therefrom 
compare one year with another, the proportion of the gross and of the 
net gain to the sales. This statement is made only at the end of the year 
after the books have been closed. The proportion of the gross gain is 
then found by adding two ciphers to the gain on Merchandise, and divid- 
ing this amount by the total Merchandise sales for the year which in this 
set of books would be as follows: 3.043.18) 78,41.3.00 (25,% per cent. 
(See 587 and amount in small figures under 5 ( JO.) The proportion of the 
net gain is then found by adding two ciphers to the net business gain 
(found on the Loss & Gain account) and dividing that amount by the to- 
tal Merchandise sales for the year, which in this set is as follows : 304318) 
2666200 (SjW per cent. (See 797,798 and amount under 590.) 



712 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

STOCK COMPANIES. 

81J>. Or/'inh<itlon. When a stock company is organized, it is done 
by several persons coming together and making a certificate to the effect 
that they propose to form a corporation to bear a certain name, for the 
purpose of transacting a certain kind of business at a certain place; and 
that they propose to issue a certain number of shares at a certain price 
per share ; that the capital stock of the corporation is to be a certain 
amount ; and the duration of the corporation a certain period of time. 
This certificate is filed in the office of the Provincial Secretary, after hav- 
ing been previously advertized in the Gazette. 

A subscription book is then opened and the shares of the company are 
disposed of by subscription, the persons subscribing paying ten per cent, 
down, and the balance afterward at such times and in such payments as 
the by-laws, hereafter to be made, may designate. 

After one-half of the capital stock has been subscribed for, a meeting of 
the subscribers is called and by-laws are by them made ; a record of the 
proceedings in this meeting is then filed in the office of the Provincial 
Secretary, whereuoon a certificate is issued to the effect that the corpora- 
tion is fully organized according to the laws of the Province. 

820. Stock Holders or Share Holders. Certificates of Stock are issued 
to each of the subscribers for the number of shares by each subscribed. 
These certificates are transferable at the pleasure of the owners, except 
when the owners are indebted to the corporation, then the transfer cannot 
be made without the consent of the corporation. 

821. Capital Stock Increased or Jtiminixht'.d. The capital stock of a 
corporation may be increased or diminished by a vote of a majority of the 
stockholders representing a majority of the stock, a statement of which in- 
crease or decrease of stock must be filed with the Provincial Secretary. 
The capital stock of a corporation is never allowed to exceed a certain 
amount, that amount being determined by the laws of the Province gov- 
erning " Corporations." 

822. Book-keeping for a Stock Company. A. "Capital Stock" ac- 
count is opened in the General Ledger, which account is credited when- 
ever capital is paid in, i. e., when payments are made on subscriptions, the 
Capital Stock account is credited for the amounts of such payments. 
When all the shares originally issued by the corporation arc sold and paid 
for, then the Capital Stock account will be credited for just the amount 
that the certificate originally issued and filed with the Provincial Secre- 



STOCK COMPANIES. 74,3 

tary indicated would be the capital stock of the corporation. Th.3 amount 
for which a Capital Stock account is credited is called the " Paid Up 
Capital " of the Company. 

After the shares have thus all been issued and paid for, the Capital 
Stock account is allowed to stand from year to year without an entry be- 
ing made thereon, unless the capital stock of the corporation be dimin- 
ished or increased and then this account is debited or credited accord- 
ingly. 

823. Gains and Losses and Surplus Fund. The gains and losses of 
the corporation are first carried to a Loss and Gain account the same as in 
any other book-keeping ; but afterward when the net gain or the net loss 
is found, unlike any other book-keeping, it is carried to a "Surplus Fund" 
account, and in that account it is allowed to remain until a dividend is de- 
clared by the Company, at which time this " Surplus Fund" account is 
debited and a " Dividend " account is credited for the amount of such divi- 
dend. Whenever the dividends are paid to the shareholders, the " Divi- 
dend " account is debited for such amounts ; therefore, when they have all 
been paid, the " Dividend" account will just balance. 

824. There is another method of disposing of the net gain, which is to 
declare a dividend as soon as the net gain is found for a certain portion of 
that gain ; then credit " Dividend " account for the amount of the divi- 
dend thus declared, and " Surplus Fund " account for the balance ; the 
former method, however (823), is thought to be the better one. 

885. Dividends. The dividend is seldom declared for the full amount 
of the gain, for the reason that the Company wishes to reserve a portion 
of the amount as a surplus fund, against which they may draw at such 
times as the net gain is not sufficient to make up the customary rate per 
cent, of dividend which is at regular intervals declared by the Company. 
For example : If a Company declare a five per cent, dividend semi-annually 
arid the number of shares issued by this Company require at this per cent, 
a dividend to the amount of 815,000 and the net gain of the Company be 
only 12,000, then the " Surplus Fund " account must be drawn on to the 
extent of 3,000. 

If the final result of the Company's business be a net loss, the entire 
amount of such loss must be carried from the Loss and Gain account to 
the debit side of the " Surplus Fund " account. 

Some Stock Companies declare dividends semi-annually. some quarterly, 
and a few monthly, while others have no stated times in which to declare 
them, but do so only at such times as it is the general wish of the stock- 
holders so to do. 



744 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

826. Dividend Receipt Book. This is a book in which are entered in 
alphabetical order, whenever a dividend is declared, the names of each of 
the shareholders, together with the number and value of shares held, the 
percentage of dividend and dividend amount. Opposite each of these 
amounts, whenever the dividends are paid to them, the shareholders si<m 
their names and enter the dates upon which they receive such payment. 

827. Stock Ledger. The Stock Ledger is a book in which is kept a 
record of the names of all the shareholders and number and par value of 
shares held by each. It is a private book, and is in no ivay connected ivith 
the other books of the Company. A. " Capital Stock " account is opened in 
this book, which account is debited for the total number and par value of 
the shares issued by the corporation ; following this, an account is then 
opened with each of the shareholders ; then, the " Capital Stock" account 
is credited for all shares that are disposed of, and each of the persons to 
whom such shares were sold are debited for the number and par value of 
same. When the total number of shares issued by the corporation has been 
disposed of, the " Capital Stock " account here opened will balance, and 
all the shares will have been debited to shareholders ; therefore, when this 
account does not balance, the difference between the two sides always shows 
the number and par value of shares remaining unsold, or not yet subscribed 
for. The total of all the accounts in the Stock Ledger (including the dif- 
ference, if any, between the two sides of the " Capital Stock " account) 
should always represent just the amount of stock issued by the corpora- 
tion. 

When a shareholder transfers shares to another person, the person to 
whom the shares are transferred must take the certificate of stock to the 
Company which issues it and have the transfer recorded in the Stock 
Ledger ; which is done by the Company crediting the old shareholder and 
debiting the new. 

828. "Limited" Liability and "Full Liability" Companies. LIMITED. 
When the word '' Limited" is affixed to a stock company's name, it sig- 
nifies that each shareholder is individually liable to the creditors of the 
company for only the amount representing the value of shares held by 
each. If suit is brought against the Company for a claim and it is not 
paid by the Company, action may be brought against any one of the share- 
holders to the extent of the shares held by him ; and when claim is by 
him paid, he may recover from each of the other shareholders the amount 
paid in proportion to the shares by each held less his own proportion of 
such claim. If a " Limited Liability Company ' omits to add the word 
" Limited" after its name wherever and whenever they cause it (o appear 



SUNDRY INSTRUCTIONS, HINTS, ETC. 745 

a heavy fine is imposed for each omission. FULL. When the word 
" Limited " is not affixed to to a stock company's name, it is understood 
that it is a " Full Liability Company." In such a company the shareholders 
are each individually liable to the creditors of same for the total liabilities- 
of the company. However suit cannot be brought against an individual 
shareholder until it has first been brought against the Company, and then, 
if not paid, the claimant may institute proceedings against any one of the 
shareholders of the Company for the full amount of the claim ; and after 
same has been paid by the shareholders, he may recover from each of the 
shareholders proportionately, according to the number of shares held by 
each, the amount paid less, of course, his own proportion of such claim.

829. Checks, Drafts, X'otes, Etc. When a check is printed payable to 
bearer, it may be made payable to order by simply erasing the word 
" bearer " by drawing a line through it with the pen. 

830. When you receive a bank draft, sight draft, or check made pay- 
able to the order of the party sending it, see whether or not it is endorsed 
by him. If not endorsed return it to him for the endorsement, as it is of 
no value to you until so endorsed. 

83 1 . In receiving a check or draft from a person, upon which check 
or draft the person's name does not in any place appear, whether made 
payable to order or to bearer, have this person from whom yon receive it 
endorse it ; for if it prove to be worthless, you can then have recourse to 
this person, as by endorsing his name on the back of it, the pa} r ment is by 
him guaranteed. 

832. When we return a draft, note or check to the maker of same, 
which draft, note or check we had endorsed, we should always erase our 
name from the paper by drawing lines through it with the pen. 

832. 1-2 In handing a note to the bank or express company for col- 
lection, which note will be due in a few days, some business men simply 
make a memorandum in full for same, and place the memorandum with 
the not-yet-due notes making no entry on the books until the note is 
collected and the proceeds of same returned, then the Bills Receivable 
account is credited, and the memorandum found and destroyed. 

833. On Receiving dish. When cash is received examine it closely to 
see whether or not there are any counterfeits ; and if there be a doubtful 



74C THK HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

bill, make a memorandum of it, showing from whom it was received, then 
try this at the bank in the next deposit. 

834. Payment on Discounted Nole*. When we receive payments on 
notes which have been discounted and still remain in the bank, we simply 
take the money to the bank and see that the amount is by the banker 
endorsed thereon no entry being made for same on our books unless it 
be to make a memorandum of such payments in the Bills Receivable and 
Bills Payable Book. 

835. Waive Protest, When there are no endorsers on the notes we 
receive from our customers, and we wish to discount them in the bank, 
waive protest by writing on the backs of such notes " Protest Waived,' 
and thereby save the customers the protest fees that would otherwise be 
charged if the notes should not be paid when due. Care must be taken 
not to waive protest on notes having endorsers ; for if protest be waived 
on such notes, the security is, in some States, released. 

836. Sight Draft. In making a sight draft on a person, if you want 
it paid upon presentation, leave the " time" blank ; i. e., commence it : 
"Pay to the order of," etc. It is customary, however, to make the 
drafts " at sight " or " at three days' sight " in order not to take the 
person upon whom drawn by surprise, but to give him a little time to 
raise the money. 

S3T. Computing Interest on Payments. In computing interest on 
payments on notes, it is the better plan to compute the interest on the 
full face of the note up to the present time, and afterward on each pay- 
ment up to the present time ; then the difference may be found between 
the sums total of the interest on the payments and the amount of the in- 
terest on the full face, which difference will be the net amount of interest 
<lue. The total amount due will, of course, be the difference between the 
sum total of the payments and the sum total of the face of the note plus 
the interest due. 

338. "C. O.D.' Sab'*, <"l Sales for which we make Sight Draft as 
soon as Goods are Shipped. When we ship goods to the country C. O. D., 
or ship them and make a sight draft on the person as soon as the goods 
are shipped, we may enter the person's name under our " Petty Accounts," 
if we have no regular account with him, as it is not advisable to open an 
account for only one entry. The person must, of course, be charged as 
soon as the goods are shipped, and credited when the money is, by the 
express company or bank, collected a^nd returned to us. 

839. Different Kinds of Business Consolidated. When a merchant 
conducts several different kinds of business in one, and wishes to know 



SUNDRY INSTRUCTIONS, HINTS, ETC. 747 

his gains on sales for each, the books may be kept in the following man- 
ner : The cash sales for each business must be kept seperate, and at the 
close of each day, week or month credited to the respective accounts to 
which they belong ; extra columns may be kept for each business in the 
Journal, and whenever sales are made on account, the amounts of sales 
extended into the respective columns to which they belong, the totals of 
these columns carried forward until the end of the month, and then the 
totals 'for the month credited to the respective accounts in the Ledger- 
For example : If Grocery, Dry Goods, and Boots and Shoes consolidated, 
on the credit side of the Journal would be kept four columns ; a " Miscel- 
laneous Or.," a " Grocery Or.," a " Dry Goods Cr." and a " Boots and Shoes 
Cr." ; then when a sale is recorded, that part of it which belongs to the 
grocery department is extended into that column, the dry goods into the 
" Dry Goods " column, etc. ; and whenever a credit that belongs to none of 
the three latter columns, it is extended into the "Miscellaneous Cr." 
column. The Invoices are first assorted according to the different kinds 
of business, after which the Grocery bills are entered, then the Dry Goods j 
and then the Boots and Shoes. The columns for each of these dif- 
ferent kinds of business are treated the same throughout as is the 
"Merchandise Cr." column in the Journal of "The Illustration ;" the 
invoices are entered the same as the Mdse. invoices, and the accounts 
are treated the same as the Merchandise account is treated in " The 
Illustration." 

The books are kept in this manner simply as a matter of satisfaction, 
that we may know how much has been made on the goods sold from each 
business. There are but very few who keep the expenses for each 
business separate; but when they do, either a "full set" of expense 
accounts must be kept for each business, or the expenses incurred in 
each business must at once be charged directly to the respective busi- 
ness to which it belongs. For example : When a grocery clerk is paid 
his wages the amount must at once be debited to the Grocery account. 

The expenses may be charged proportionately to the different kinds of 
business ; i. e., when the sum total of the expenses for the entire business 
is found, a certain per cent, of the same may be carried to the debit of the 
Grocery account, a certain per cent, to the Dry Goods, and a certain per 
cent, to the Boots and Shoes. 

84O. On Transferring Accounts from an Old Lender to a Neu\ This 
is done by balancing the accounts in the old Ledger in the manner de- 
scribed in paragraph 308, following the directions there given in entirety, 



748 THE HOME, FARM AXD BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA.. 

excepting, while reading those instructions, substitute " to the page opened 
for this account in the new Ledger " in place of " new page." 

841 Statements. It is advisable to make and send out statements of 
all our customers' accounts on the first of every month. By so doing an 
account cannot escape our notice and thereby be allowed to remain on our 
books until it is long past due without the person having been notified 
monthly of that fact. Another reason for so doing is, because if any mis- 
takes have been made in posting, by which an item was posted to the 
wrong account or 'to the wrong side of an account, we are then notified by 
the persons who receive the incorrect statements, and we may then make 
the corrections in the Ledger. 

O 

842. Ou Copying Invoices of Goods We Bu.y. There are a few firms 
who keep Invoice Books or Purchase Books into which they copy the 
items from all the bills of goods they buy. This is an absurd practice and 
a lavish waste of time ; for, after the amount of an invoice has been cre- 
dited to the person, !the invoice is thereafter held as a memorandum for 
reference ; and, if we wish therefore to refer to a purchase we have but 
to find the invoice, which is done in the manner described in 309. 

843. Classification of Account*. When but one Ledger is used, it is 
advisable to have the miscellaneous accounts in the fore part, and follow- 
ing these, the accounts with persons from whom we buy, reserving the 
back part of the Ledger for the accounts with our customers ; or, wa may 
have our dealers' accounts in the fore part and our creditors, in the back, 
as we prefer. 

844. Overcharges, etc. Sometimes persons from whom we buy goods 
guarantee the freight at a certain rate, i. e., guarantee that the goods will 
be laid in our store at a certain rate per 100 Ibs. or per piece. If the 
Railroad company charges us more than this rate, we debit the over- 
charge to the person from whom we bought the goods. If any overchai 

in prices on goods, such overcharge may be deducted from the bills before 
they are entered. If goods are damaged, we must first ascertain whether 
they were damaged while in transit,'or before they were shipped, if the for- 
mer, the Railroad company must be debited for the amount of such dama- 
gi's; if the latter, the amount of such damages may either be deducted 
from the bill before it is entered, or the full face ,,f the bill credited to the 
person and the amount of the claim for damages afterward debited to hi* 
account. 

If any error in " figuring," the amount of such error may be deducted 
from the bill before it is entered. 



SUNDRY INSTRUCTIONS, HINTS, ETC. 74.9 

If a claim for overcharge, damaged goods, or error, is made on a bill af- 
ter it has been entered, the amount of such claim cannot then, of course, 
be deducted from the bill, but must be debited to the person's account. 
Whenever such a charge is made, the person must, in all cases, be notified 
of same either by sending a bill or writing a letter to that effect. 

845. " Easy " Customers. There are very few firms who have not 
some customers who " take the world easy " and allow nothing to trouble 
them not even their debts; and in consequence of this independence (?) 
such customers would willingly allow their accounts to pass into the " vale 
of forgetfulness," were it not for the fact that somehow or another the 
owners of such accounts cannot tune their ideas to harmonize with them 
and, therefore, there is a discord. We might dun such customers for cash 
or for notes to balance their accounts until " doomsday," and be just as 
successful at the beginning of our exertions as at the end. However, if 
we succeed in getting notes from such persons, there are then some hopes 
of ultimately collecting the amounts due ; for they then realize that they 
must make some exertion to pay. unless they have become so hardened 
that not even a note will move them to action, The tougher the custo- 
mer we have, the sharper the " goad " we seek if only moderately dila- 
tory, and we think him abundantly able to pay all his debts, we simply 
ask for a note without security ; if a little doubtful, we ask him for a note 
with a good endorser ; if altogether doubtful, we endeavour to get notes 
secured by a mortgage on his stock of goods, his lot, or his farm. There are 
many customers who, when we send a statement requesting them to send 
us notes for amount due, will take no notice whatever of our request ; but 
if, when we send the statement, we will fill out and enclose with same 
notes for them to sign, they then feel in duty bound either to do as we re- 
quest, or offer some very good excuse for not so doing ; therefore this lat- 
ter method is recommended. 

846. The Services of an Office Boy. A smart office boy may, in most 
cases, be a very great convenience to a book-keeper ; so much so, that the 
services of an assistant book-keeper may be dispensed with. For instance, 
he may do all such work as making duplicate bills, copying letters, ad- 
dressing envelopes and enclosing the letters, statements or bills in same, 
delivering the statements to the city customers on the first of every month, 
running errands, etc., etc. ; forms of business letters may be prepared by 
the book-keeper, and by using these, the boy may write a great many- 
business letters that would otherwise have to be written by the book- 
keeper. One day in such a school is better for the boy than a whole 
month in a business college. 



7oO THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

847. Errors in Posting. When errors arc made in posting, some 
book-keepers make what is called a "contra entry ; " i, e., make an entry 
on the opposite side of the account " By Error" to balance the entry erro- 
neously made, and afterward post the amount as it should first have been 
posted ; and some book-keepers erase with a steel eraser the error, but 
some business men object to " scratching on the books," not wanting 
a figure altered after it has once been placed in the Ledger. A better 
method than either of the foregoing, and one to which no person could 
object, is to simply draw a red line through the amount of such error and 
then post the amount as it should have been posted. If, however, the 
error was made in a previous month, it is then necessary either to make 
a contra entry, as above described, or if a line drawn through the amount, 
to change the lead-pencil Ledger footings. 

8-IH. O'n Making Mistakes. There are some business men who, in a 
temporary fit of insanity, forget that they are the only persons who can 
justly claim " infallibility," and, in consequence of this little forgetfulness, 
chastise the book-keeper severely for every little " blunder" he makes. 
A book-keeper's work is, to say the least, very monotonous, and it is with 
great difficulty that he confines his mind to his work from morning until 
night, day after day. The errors he makes are usually made at such times 
as his mind is roaming in other fields rather than that in which he is at 
work perhaps while he is looking forward to the day when he can give 
" figures" and " trial-balances" a long vacation. While posting, it is advis- 
able for the book-keeper to " make assurance doubly sure " by comparing 
the amount carried to the Ledger with the amount on the book from 
which it is posted, at least twice, noticing at the same time whether 
posted to the proper side of the account. 

When cash is received or paid out, it is better not to trust the memory 
one instant, for it is sometimes very treacherous, but to make the entry on 
the Cash Book at once ; otherwise an hour might be spent in seeking for a 
little " difficulty " in the cash that might have been avoided if the entrv 
had been made at the proper moment. 

Units Under Units, etc. The utmost care must be taken at all times to 
place units directly under units, tens directly under tens, etc., etc. ; for 
while adding, if such care has not been taken, it is very easy to make a 
mistake, Better to spend an hour now in being over-particular on this 
score, than a week at the end of the month when the trial-balance is 
taken, in finding an error caused by carelessness in placing tens under 
hundreds, or something similar. 



SUNDRY INSTRUCTIONS, HINTS, ETC. 751 

849. Invoices, Notes, etc., we have to Pay. For the invoices, notes, and 
acceptances for which we have to remit, and the sight drafts for which we 
have to pay, would recommend the following method of making the daily 
lists or memoi'anda : Take a small book and arrange the dates in the form 
of a diary, omitting the Sundays ; then, on the first of each month, from 
the Bills Payable Book, enter under the respective dates when they be- 
come due, on this small book, all the notes and acceptances we have to 
pay during the month. After which, the sight drafts we accept and the 
bills for which we wish to remit may, from day to day, be herein entered 
under the respective dates when due. Enter first the amount ; then the 
firm name, adding the address (if not familiar with same) ; then, if a note 
acceptance, .or sight draft, write " Note," " Ace.," or "St. D'ft," adding the 
date and time of same and if a bill or several bills, add date or dates 
of same. By making the lists in this manner, all the remittance let- 
ters may be written from the memoranda here made. The amount 
to be paid daily may be found by finding the sums total of these 
lists. If we wish to buy Exchange (bank drafts) to pay for such notes^ 
invoices, etc., as we have in one of these daily lists, or if we wish to pay 
for such of our notes, acceptances, and sight drafts as are made payable 
at our bank, we simply find the sum total of the list thus made and give 
the bank a check for the same, filling out a " Drafts Wanted " blank for 
the Exchange we want, and, together with the " notices " we have received 
from the bank for notes and acceptances due on that day, pin them to the 
check ; after which we receive from the bank, in return for same, the 
notes and acceptances stamped " Paid," and the Bank Drafts, which should 
aggregate an amount equal to the full amount of the check we gave. The 
following will be given as an illustration of this method the " 17" at the 
top being the day of the month :

85O. Sundry Minute Savinys of Time and Labour. A great saving of 
time may be realized in the wholesale business, while making bills and 
statements, by giving the larger cities in which we have many customers, 
a city number ; then the bill clerk, while making the bills, or the book- 
keeper, while making the statements, for the convenience of the person 



752 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

who addresses the envelopes for same, simply indicates the addresses of 
the customers by adding the respective city numbers representing the 
cities in which they belong the person addressing the envelopes being 
also, of course, familiar with the city numbers. 

While addressing several envelopes, lay the letters, bills or statements 
to the right and the envelopes to the left; then, after they have all been 
addressed, they will be found in regular order, and consequently such let- 
ters, etc., may be expeditiously folded and enclosed. 

"While posting it is advisable to use a small slip of coloured paper on 
the money column of the Journal or Cash Book, and always to keep this 
directly over the amount that is next to be posted, moving the slip down- 
ward to the next amount as soon as that amount is posted. By so doing, 
much time may be saved that would otherwise be spent in tracing the 
lines out for the amounts ; and it is a good way to guard against errors in 
posting the wrong amounts to the Ledger. 

On the other side of the Line it is now rapidly growing into custom 
among business men to omit all " handles to names," such as " Mr.," 
" Esq.," " Messrs.," etc., while addressing envelopes, writing letters, notes, 
checks, drafts, etc., it being thought to be understood, therefore super- 
fluous. In Canada, however, we properly adhere to the more courteous 
practice, which is certainly preferable. 

While receipting bills, statements, etc., the simple word " Paid " answers 
the same purpose as " Received Payment," and is much more quickly 
written. 

It is of course understood by everyone, that the nearer perpendicular 
the writing, the more there may be written on a line. It is better to have 
an explanation of an entry in the Cash Book never take up more space 
than the line upon which the entry is made ; and as some entries require 
a considerable amount of explanation, it is necessary that the same be 
made very compact as well as very concise. 

851. Sundry Explanations and Remarks. The meaning of the word 
" Sundries " is " several." For example : when is written " Mdse. Dr. to 
Sundries," the meaning is, that Merchandise account is debited for the 
sum total of an amount for which two or more or several accounts are 
credited. 

A debtor is a person who is indebted to or owing us ; and a creditor, is 
a person to whom we are indebted or owing ; therefore, the former, one 
who is debited on our books, and the latter, one who is credited on our 
books. 



SIXGLE E.VTRY BOOK-KEEPIXG. 733 

When goods are sold or bought on " account," the meaning is that they 
are not paid for, but are to be debited or credited to the party to whom 
sold or from whom bought ; therefore, when the expression " on account '' 
is used, it indicates that the amount is to be placed to the debit or credit 
of some personal account. 

Those accounts upon which we think there will never more be entries 

\ made, are called " Dead Accounts," and those accounts which are yet open^ 

and upon which we either frequently or seldom make entries, are called 

" Live Accounts." The more frequent the entries are made, the more is 

the vitality with which the account is infused. 

When there are but one or two " extra columns " in the Cash Book or 
the Journal, it is not necessary to have printed or to write the names of 
same at the top of each column ; for the uses of same are known to the 
book-keeper and he is not obliged to refer to the top of the page for the 
name of the column in which to enter an item. However, when several 
" extra columns " are used, it is necessary to have the book ruled and 
printed to order. 

No employe* can sign notes, drafts or checks for the firm without first 
having procured a " Power of Attorney " authorizing him so to do ; but he 
may endorse for deposit in the bank drafts, notes, checks, etc., made paya- 
ble to the order of the firm, by simply getting a written order from them 
to the cashier of the bank authorizing him to do so. When the latter is 
done, the signature of the employe" so authorized is recorded in the bank's 
" Signature Book," and the firm's written order is taken by the cashier of 
the bank and filed away, so as to insure against any accidents, etc., that 
might occur through the carelessness or negligence of such employe*. 

When a merchant's Liabilites exceed his Resources, he is then insolvent ; 
and the difference between the sum total of his Resources and the sum 
total of his Liabilities is his net insolvency, which difference will appear 
on the debit side of his Stock account instead of on the credit, as is the 
case when the Resources exceed the Liabilities and the difference is known 
as a net worth. 

SINGLE ENTRY BOOK-KEEPING. 

852. The difference between Single Entry book-keeping und Double 
Entry book-keeping is explained in paragraphs 3 and G. Any person 
who is the possessor of as much as a thimble full of brains, may already, 
without instruction, justly and honestly claim a knowledge of Single 
Entry book-keeping ; for the boy but five years of age (unless he be a sou 
vv 



754 THE HOMK, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

of a business college professor) knows full well that if he buys something 
and does not pay for it that he owes the person from whom the article 
was bought, and thereupon he conceives the idea of credit ; and when he 
pays for this article, he knows full well that the debt exists no lonn-er, 
and thereupon he conceives the idea of a debit to balance that credit; 
when he sells an article and does not receive payment therefor, he knows 
that the person to whom he sold the article is indebted to him for same, - 
and thereupon the idea of debit is conceived ; and when this person can- 
cels the obligation by paying for the marbles o'r taffy, the boy knows full 
well that his comrade to Avhom he sold the same owes him no longer and 

o " 

thereupon, an idea is conceived for a credit to balance that debit this is 
all that Single Entry book-keeping consists of simply debiting persons 
when we sell them goods on account in the manner and form illustrated 
in paragraph 370, and crediting them when they pay for same ; and credit- 
ing persons when we buy goods from them on account in the manner 
illustrated in paragraphs 401 to 407, and debiting them when we pay for 
same. 

It will be seen that in strictly Single Entry book-keeping there are no 
accounts in the Ledger but accounts with persons ; therefore Single Entry, 
unlike Double Entry, does not exhibit a statement of the business done, 
but is .simply a record of the amounts owing to us and by us on account. 
(See 3.) In posting an item in Single Entry, if the person is debited, we 
simply post the amount to the debit of his account in the Ledger, and 
make no credit whatever ; if the person is credited, we simply post the 
amount to the credit of his account in the Ledger, and make no debit 
whatsoever for same. Whenever there are any other than personal ac- 
counts in the Single Entry Ledger, there has been just so much borrowed 
from Double Entry book-keeping. (See 313 and 314.) There are a great 
many firms who keep a Merchandize account and an Expense account in. 
the Ledger simply as memorandum accounts, to the Merchandise account 
they post at the end of each month, the same as in Double Entry, the 
total sales for the month ; and to the Expense account they post all items 
of expense, of whatsoever kind. These accounts are kept just as a matter of 
gratification that they may see what their total sales for the year are and 
what their total expenses. They also keep a Cash Book which they treat 
in the same manner as the book illustrated in this work. There are some 
houses who keep a Bank account crediting the bank on the debit side of 
the Cash Book when checks are drawn, and debiting the accounts for 
which sucli checks are given on the credit side of the Cash Book ; and 
debiting the bank on the credit side of the Cash Book whenever deposits 
are made; but the system recommended in So'i is the one most in use. 



ADDITIONAL BOOKS USED IX A WHOLESALE BUSINESS. 755 

ADDITIONAL BOOKS USED IN A WHOLESALE BUSINESS. 

853. The books used in a wholesale business in addition to those al- 
ready explained and illustrated heretofore in this work are as follows : 

Bade Orders. A book in which are entered orders for goods we have 
not in stock, but have ordered or intend to order. Such orders are al- 
lowed to remain in this book until the goods arrive, then they are filled 
and the charges transferred from this book to the Journal, the same as 
from the Sales Books to the Journal. 

Debit Ledger or Dealers Ledger. A book in which are kept exclusively 
accounts with our customers. 

Credit Ledger or General Ledger. A book in which are kept accounts 
with persons from whom we buy goods ; also all other accounts that do 
not belong in the Debit or Dealer's Ledger. 

East '/rn Order Book. A book in which is made a record of the goods 
we order, whether.through agent or by mail, with prices and terms af- 
fixed which were guaranteed by agent or quoted by mail. Nearly all 
large wholesale houses have a Stockkeeper, whose duty it is to keep 
posted on the stock of goods in the store, and to report whenever the 
stock is running down in any particular line; then a memorandum is 
made in this book and the goods are ordered. 

Receiving Book. This is a book in which is made a record of goods we 
receive from the parties from whom we bought. The record is made just 
as soon as the goods are placed in the store. The invoices are checked off 
from this book to indicate that the goods have been received. 

Change Book. It is customary with most manufactories and large whole- 
sale houses to notify their customers of any changes in prices of the goods 
they handle ; and when we receive such advice we make a memorandum 
of the present price in this book. Our travelling agents are then all ad- 
vised of such changes, if not of much consequence, by letter, and of great 
importance, by telegram. We use our cost mark in this book instead of 
the figures to prevent the " curious " from booming enlightened should 
they at any time find this book lying open on the desk. 

Price Books. These are small books carried by each of the salesmen 
and proprietors of the firm, in which is arranged in alphabetical form a 
li>t of all the goods in the store with both the cost and*the selling prices 
attached. Whenever a memorandum is made in the Change Book for a 
change in the price of any particular line of goods, the change is at once 
made on each of the price books to correspond with same. 



756 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

Sales Books. In some of the largest wholesale houses a very nice sys- 
tem of keeping Sales Books is adopted, which will be described as follows ; 
They have labelled on one, " Monday Wednesday, Friday ; " on the other, 
" Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday." The sales for each of the different days 
of the week, are recorded in the respective book upon which is labelled 
the day. While entries are being made on Tuesday in the " Tuesday " 
book, the entries that were made on the previous day are being posted 
from the " Monday " book ; therefore the " Monday " book is handed in to 
the book-keeper by the entry clerk on every Monday night, and the " Tues- 
day " book is by the book-keeper handed to the entry clerk on every 
Tuesday morning and so on through the week. By so doing the book- 
keeper is never interrupted while posting these books. 

Sales Another Method. There is another method which will be de- 
scribed as follows : To have loose sheets ruled in regular Sales Book form r 
and numbered from " I " forward. The sales are recorded on these sheets 
the same as they would be if recorded in a book ; when a sheet is filled 
it passed to the book-keeper who posts all the entries on it, and afterward 
files it in a safe place until he has a certain number of pages or of months, 
when he has them bound in book form. The total is posted to the credit 
of Mdse. account monthly from this book. 

Sales Another Method. There is another method which is much in use 

because of its simplicity and labour saving, which will be described as fol- 
lows : Write the invoices of goods we sell in copying ink and copy them 
in a copying book used expressly for that purpose ; post the charges to 
the personal direct from this copying book to the Ledger, carry forward 
the sales from page to page until the end of the month, and then post the 
total for the month to the credit of Merchandise. Some firms adopt a me- 
thod of numbering the bills, and when posting to refer in the Ledger to 
the bill number, instead of to the page upon which the bill is copied. 

The Different Books Used. The books used in a business depend en- 
tirely upon the nature and style of the business, although a person will 
often find books exactly alike in nature and

854. l.st. Take an inventory of all the merchandise, store fixtures, 
etc., etc., belonging to the firm.

2nd. Make a statement of all the Resources and Liabilities of the firm, 
(See 20 and 21.) Wake this statement in the form of the Trial Balance 
illustrated in paragraphs 810 and 812 entering the Resources in the debit 
column and the Liabilities in the credit. Include the private accounts of 
each of the partners in this statement, the same as any personal accounts. 

3rd. Find the difference between the sum total of the Liabilities and 

the sum total of the Resources, and this difference will be the present 
gross worth of the firm. 

4th. Find the net worth of the firm at commencement of business (the 

sum total of all the partners' original investments), then, find the differ- 
ence between the now present gross worth and the then present net worth of 
same which difference will be the net business gain or net business loss 
for the firm if worth more now than then, of course a gain ; and if worth 
less now than then, a loss. 

5th. If a net business gain, credit each partner's Stock account for his 

share of such gain ; if a net business loss, debit each partner's Stock ac- 
count for his share of such loss. 

6th. Close each Partner's Private account and carry the balance of 

same to their respective Stock accounts. If the debit side of a Private 
account be the larger, the difference between the two sides is carried to 
the debit side of the Stock account ; if the credit side be the larger, the 
difference between the two sides is carried to the credit side of the Stock 

account. 

7th. the difference between the two sides of the respective Stock 

accounts is now found, which difference is the present net worth of each 
and this is the object in view in closing the books to find the present 
net worth of each of the partners. This concludes the closing of the books. 

855. Remarlcs There are some firms that keep their books by Single 
Entry and allow the same to run several years without closing them 
either not wanting to take the trouble to find out how much lost or gained 
by closing the books, or worse still, not knowing the proceedings for doing 
so, and they thus allow them to run from year to year, until finally, there 
is 'a " death in the family," or one of the members of the firm wishes to 
withdraw, and then it becomes necessary to close the books to find the 
present net worth of each ; which closing is done according to instructions 
given in this article. 

In making a statement of the Resources and Liabilities, the Private ac- 
counts of all the members must be included, in order to ascertain the net 
business gain or net business loss of the firm ; and afterwards, these Pri- 
vate accounts must finally be closed and carried into the respective Stock 



758 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

accounts of eacli of the members in order to find the present net worth of 
each. 

The present gross worth of the firm is found by finding the difference 
between the sum total of its Liabilities and the sum total of its Resources, 
Private accounts included. 

The present net ivorth of the firm is found by finding the sum total of 
all the amounts credited to each of its members as his present net worth, 
i. e., after such accounts have been closed as per instructions in " 7th " 
of this article. 

856. When there is but a single proprietor, there are some who do not 
keep a Stock account, and a few who keep neither a Stock nor a Private 
account, but charge amounts drawn for private use to no account simply- 
writing " Private use," or something similar, on the Cash Book ; this is, 
however, a very loose system of book-keeping, affording no satisfaction 
whatever to the business man other than merely showing him the personal 
accounts owing to and by him. When no Private account has been kept, 
there is no way of finding how much has been expended for private use, 
unless an account had been kept called " Private Expenses ; " neither can 
the amount gained or lost in the business be ascertained, for the reason 
that the amount drawn for private use has been taken from the business 
and no account made thereof. 

856?,. If other than personal accounts have been kept, such as Ex- 
pense, Merchandise, etc., the balance from such accounts must not be carried 
forward to the new double entry books or accounts, but such old accounts 
or old balances must be dropped, abandoned, for the reason that they were 
kept in Single Entry simply as memorandum accounts, in order that the 
firm mi"ht know what their expenses and sales were. 



ON " MAKING THE CASH." 

851. It is best to balance the Cash Book every day, although some firms 
balance it only once a month. Whether we balance the book every day 
or not, we should every night see whether the balance on hand as shown 
by the Cash Book agrees with the amount we actually have on hand. The 
writer would recommend the following described and illustrated method 
of finding whether or not the cash balances : Take a .slip of paper and put 
down in figures at the left, as illustrated below, first, the balance we had 
on hand in the morning, and under this the total cash received during the 
day; add these amounts together; then under this sum just found, enter 



OX " MAKING THE CASH." 7.59 

the total cash paid out during the day, which amount subtract from the 
sum above it which will give the amount of cash we ought to have on 
hand. Then put down in figures at the right on the slip, as illustrated 
below, first, the balance iu the bank as shown by the Check Book, then 
the amounts of all checks, drafts, etc. (called cash), and the cash we have 
in the cash drawer, after which find the amount of cash on hand we actu- 
ally have by finding the total of these amounts, the sum of which total 
should just agree with the balance on hand as shown by the Cash Book 
and indicated in the figures at the left on the slip. (See below ; also in 
the Cash Book, 485, 548, 551, and 552.)

858. Handling the Cash. If the cashier is to be responsible for the 
cash, no othar person should be permitted to handle it, then, if any errors 
occur by which the Cash Book and cash do not agree, he may justly be 
held accountable for same. 

If, on the other hand, everybody in the store is allowed to go to the 
cash drawer to make change and pay out and receive cash, it is then im- 
possible, if an error be made, to know by whom it was made. 

If the balance called for by the Cash Book docs not agree with the cash 
actually on hand, and the cashier after diligent search does not find the 
error, lie may make it agree in the following described manner : IF CASH 
IS OVER. If the cash is over, i. e., more cash on hand than is called for 
by the Cash Book, the amount over may be credited to the Merchandise 
account by writing on the debit side of the Cash Book, " To Mlse. Cash 
over could not account for," and the amount, and this will make them 
agree ; afterward, if the error is found for this amount, the proper account 
may be credited and merchandise debited. IF CASK is SHORT. If the 
cash is short, i. e., less cash on hand than is called for by the Cash Book ] 
tha thoroughly conscientious cashier will charge the amount short to his 
own account, by writing his name on the credit side of the Cash Book, ad- 
ding, " Cash short could not account for ; " and afterward if the error be 
found, will debit the amount to the proper account and credit his account 
for the same this is not done, however, until after he has made diligent 



7CO THE HOME, FAEM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

and thorough search and is finally obliged to " give up in despair." The 
reasons why he should do so are : He might have made the error in mak- 
ing change ; or, in paying an account and not charging the person ; or, in 
paying a person more than he charged them. 



SHORT CALCULATION. 

ADDITION. 

859. In adding a column of figures you should learn to do it without 
mental labour ; and, this may be acquired by any one with a little prac- 
tice. The art is acquired by learning to read a column of figures as you 
would a sentence in prose. By practice you have become so familiar with 
letters that when you see a group of them together it is not necessary for 
you^to stop and separate the letters, but you can tell at a glance what the 
word is. By practice you may become so familiar with figures that when 
you see a group of them you can tell at a glance what the sum of them is. 
In practicing the reading of a column of figures in this way, do not let 
your brain work at all, but simply pass your eyes over the figures as if 
you were reading a sentence, not reading too slowly, and you will your- 
self be surprised to find how readily you may acquire the art. First, be- 
gin with practicing on two figures, then on three, four, five and so on, un- 
til finally you will become able to write the sum total of a whole column 
without once having thought of an amount until you have the entire pro- 
duct. For example : When you see, one above the other, the following fig- 
ures, 9, 9, 5, 5, you know at a glance that the sum is 28. The reading of 
a column of figures, as in the reading of a sentence, is done by dividing a 
large group of figures into smaller groups, and from group to group read- 
ing through a column the same as from word to word we read through a 
sentence. Another example : 9, 6, 4, 2, 8, in this, we group the last four 
figures, and by taking them all into our eye at once, we see that the sum of 
them is 29, then we have but to say 20-9 or 29. The expert in addition 
will skip around "here, there and everywhere " in order to do this group- 
ing, and will sometimes go back to the beginning of a column to pick up 
a stray figure that he had left behind. 

In finding the sum total of several long columns of figures, it is well to 
set down one under the other, the total of each column ; then, after the 
sum total of the last column at the left has been found, the grand total or 
product will be the sum total of the extreme left hand column, with the 



SHORT CALCULATION. 761 

unit figure of each of the preceding totals affixed one after the other, 
reading upward. For example : We will suppose the following amounts 
to be the sums total of certain columns of figures in an example, and that 
they come in order, one under the other, as here placed, 98, 120, 65, 24, 
the sum total is 24508. In putting down the sum total of each column 
in this manner, the amount to be carried to the next column is the figures 
to the left of the unit number in the first above, it is 9 ; in the second, 
12, and so on. The object in putting down the totals in this manner is, 
that if in going over the addition a second time, the second addition does 
not agree with the first, we are not obliged to commence again from the 
beginning, but may commence with the figures to the left of the unit num- 
ber in the column preceding and " try it again." 

MULTIPLICATION. 

86O. To multiply by any number between 10 and 20, multiply by the 
unit figure ; set the product thus found one place to the right, under the 
multiplicand, and add. The sum will be the answer. For example : In 
multiplying 324 by 17, we simply multiply by 7 in the manner above in- 
dicated, thus : 

324

In order to give an idea of rapid calculation in multiplication a few ex- 
amples will here be given, and from these others may be created without 
limit by any one :

The reasons for making the computations in this manner will at once be 
apparent, from the fact that when the price is either more or less than $1, 
the fractional part of a dollar is either taken from, or added to, the amount 
that the sum would be if @ SI per yard. It is sometimes more convenient 



SHORT CALCULATION. 703 

to call the number of yards the price, and the price the number of yards, 
in order to make the computation, as in the example above ; 50 yards @ 
$1.18 would be the same as 118 yards @ 50c. ; or to say, if 100 yards @ 
SI. 18 would be 118, 50 yards would be half of that amount, or 59. In 
the first example we say, if 35 yards @ 10 per yard would be $350, at 
S2.50 per yard, it would be one-fourth of that amount, or 87.50. 

INTEREST. 

861. To find the interest on any amount, at any rate per cent., for any 
length of time : 

First. Reduce time to run on interest to months and tenths of a month. 
To find the number of tenths of a month, divide the number of days over 
a month by three, then add to the number of months the tenths, in decimal 
form. 

Second. Move the decimal point between dollars and cents in the prin- 
cipal two places to the left, divide this amount by twelve, and multiply by 
the rate per cent. ; multiply this amount by the number of months, as found 
above, and the product will be the answer. 

EXAMPLE. 360.00 @ 7 ^ cent, for 2 years, 5 months and IS days. 
SOLUTION. 2 years, 5 months and 18 days equals 29 .6 months. 
12)3.60 (Move decimal point two places to the left.) 

.30 (Divide by 12), 
.7 (Multiply by the rate per cent.) 



2.10=Interest on principal for one month. 

If $2.10 for one month, for 29.6 months it would be 29.6 times 2.10 or 62.16 
Answer. 

AT TEN PER CENT. 

First. Find the number of months and tenths of a month as in preced- 
ing item. 

Second. Move decimal point between dollars and cents in principal one 
place to the left, divide by twelve, then multiply this amount by the num- 
ber of months, as found in "first," and the product will be the answer. 

EXAMPLE. 8600. 00 (? 10^ cent., from August 7, 1877, to January 28, 1879. 
SOLUTION. From August 7, ]877, to January 28, 1879, is one year, 5 months and 
21 days, which equals 17.7 months. 

12)60.00 (Move decimal point one place to the left.) 

5 (Divide by twtlce.) Which equals interest on the principal for one 
month. 



764 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPEDIA. 

If $5 for one month, for 17.7 months it would be 17.7 times $5, which equals $88.50 

OTHER EXAMPLES. Required, the interest on a note for $267.50, running 93 days 
at 10 ^ cent. ; 93 days equals 3.1 months.

the decimal one or two places. In many examples, both multiplier and 
multiplicand, i.e. months and rate per month, can be calculated in (

ON AVEKAGING ACCOUNTS. 

889. Averaging accounts or equation of payments consists in findincr 
the common time of maturity of bills due at different times. The method 
most commonly in use for finding average date of payment is the " Inter- 
est Method," which method will be hereinafter described and illustrated 
Any rate per cent, of interest may be used in order to arrive at the result 
but one per cent, per month is thought to be the best rate, for the reason 
that a result may be found quicker with that rate than any other. The 
method of figuring at this rate will be hereinafter described. 

. The kind of an example that most commonly presents itself is 
the one in which there are several bills either bought by us, or sold by us 
on time; and for which bills we wish to ascertain the common date due 
or the date upon which the sum total of all the bills will be due our 
object in finding this date being in order that we may give a note or 
accept a draft if it be an account we owe ; or take a note from, or make a 
draft on the person if it be an account that is owing us. The rules for 
finding the average date due for this kind of an example will here be 
given, and following same will be an illustration in the form of an account 
ive owe.

891. 1st. Find the dates the bills are due, and write the same on a 

slip of paper, with the amounts opposite. 

892. 2nd. Take the bill latest due as the basis upon which to work. 

It is advisable to indicate this " basis " by boxing it, or drawing a line 

around it. 

893. 3rd. Find the number of days each bill falling due previous to 

the " basis " has to run from its date due, up to the " basis," and compute 
interest on same at the rate of one per cent, per month, calling a month 
30 days; after which, find the sum total of these several interest 

amounts. 

81) 1. 4th. Find the'sum total of all the bills; then cut off or draw : 
line through the cents and the unit number of the dollars. After which 
divide this amount by 3, place the decimal point two places to the left in 
the product thus found, which will give the interest on the total amounts 
of the bills for one day at one per cent, per month. 

895. 5th. Divide the sum total of the interest due on all the bills as 
found in 893, by the interest on all the bills for one day as found in 894., 
and the product thus found will be the number of days to count backward 
from the " basis " (892) to find the average date of payment, or the date 
all the bills fall due by equation.

897. Another example. There is another example that occurs less 
frequently, viz. : One which arises from accounts current, i. e., accounts 
with persons to whom we sell goods on time and from whom we buy 
goods on time, also cash is paid on account by us or by them. Finding 
the average date of payment on an account of this kind consists in find- 
ing the date upon which the balance or the difference between the two 
sides is due, the rules for finding same and the illustration are as fol- 
low : 

898. 1st. Find the dates the bills are due, and write the same on a 
slip of paper, with the amounts opposite taking first one side of the ac- 
count and then the other. If any cask payments, the dates put down on 
this slip for same are the dates upon which the payments were made. 

899. 2d. Same as 892 this "basis" being found either on the debit 
side or the credit, whichever presents the bill latest due. 

900. 3d. Same as 893 taking first one side of the account, and then 
the other, and keeping the figuring for the two sides "separate. 

901. 4th. Find the difference between the sum total of the interest for 
the debit side of the account and the sum total of the interest for the 
credit side of same. 

902. 5th. Find the difference between the two sides of the account ; 
then cut off or draw a line through the cents and the unit number of the 
dollars, after which divide this difference by 3, place the decimal point 
two places to the left in this product, which will give the interest on this 
balance for one day at one per cent per month. 

903. Gth Divide the balance of interest as found in 901, by the inter- 
est on the balance of account for one day, as found in 902, and the pro- 
duct thus found will be the number of days to count backward from the 
" basis" (as found in 899) to find the average date of payment, or the date 
the account is due by equation.

This gives 42 days to count backward from the "basis" (May 9th) to 
find the date upon which the account is due by equitation, or the average 
date of payment, which is March 28th. 

90S. On averaging a past-due account, for the purpose of finding the 
interest due, the average date when the account was due is first found, 
after which we compute the interest on the account, from that date up to 
the present at whatever rate per cent, agreed upon ; then, if it be an ac- 
count owing us, we charge the same for the interest thus found ; or if it 
be an account we owe, we credit the same for the interest. 

9O8. On averaging an account not yet due, for the purpose of set- 
tling by note or acceptance, the average date when the account will be due 
is first found ; then the note is either dated backward from that date the 
number of days we wish the note to run, or dated on the present date, 
and made to read in such a manner that it will fall due on the average 

date due. 

907. The three days of grace is not added when averaging an ac- 
count ; but it may be added after the average date is found, if we wish 

to do so. 

908. Explanation of the " Interest Method" of Averaging Accounts. 
We find the bill latest due, and taking this as a basis or foundation upon 
which to work, suppose all amounts prior to that to run from their re- 
spective dates due up to this " basis " date before they are paid, and 
thereupon we charge or credit, as the case may be, interest on such 
amounts for the time they thus run past due. After we have thus found 
the total interest due, we find the interest on the amount of the account 
for one day. Now we see by paying the sum total of all the bills just 
one day backward from this "basis" date, there will be due the interest 
for one day less, and consequently, we ascertain how many days backward 



OX AVERAGING ACCOUNTS. 775 

from this " basis" date we will have to pay the total amount of the bills 
in order to consume all the interest, so that there would be interest nei- 
ther owing to nor by us, by dividing the total interest due by the interest 
on the whole for one day. 

OO9. On computing interest at 1 jyer cent, per Month or 12 per cent. 
per Annum. We call a month thirty days ; therefore at this rate per 
cent, the principal earns 1 per cent, every 30 days, and T \y per cent, every 
3 days ; consequently to find the interest for 30 days, we simply move the 
decimal point between dollars and cents two places to the left, and for 
3 days we move it three places to the left. With a very little practice, in- 
terest may be very rapidly computed at this rate per cent. In the exam- 
ple under 904, we first find the interest for 30 days on $350, which is 
53.50 ; for 60 days it is twice that amount, or S7.00 ; and for 3 days 
35c. ; and 1 day, of 35c., which is 12c, Then we add 60 days, $7.00 ; 3 
days. 35c. : 1 day 12 cents; total 64 days, $7.4-7. Then $2.00, 30 days ; 
and for 3 days 20 cents. ; 9 days, three times 3 days, and consequently, 
three times 20c., or 60c. Then we add 30 days, $2.00 ; 9 days, 60c. ; total 
39 days, 2.60. Then if $1.40 for 30 days, for 90 days it is three times 
that amount, or 4.20; and if 14 cents for 3 days, it is of that amount 
for 1 day, or oc. ; total 91 days, $4.25.

The foregoing illustration is deemed sufficient to make perfectly clear 
to the mind the 1 per cent, method of figuring interest, and when by con- 
tinued practice the method has been thorougly mastered, the old torture 
of averaging accounts is rendered, on the contrary, a pleasure.

ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES OF DECEASED 
PERSONS. 

HEN a person dies, leaving no valid will behind him his 
estate is distributed among his heirs by what is known 
as operation of law. This is regulated by the statute of 
the Province in which the deceased resided at the time 
of his death. The distribution must be made by an ad- 
ministrator duly appointed by law. The administrator 
is appointed by the court having jurisdiction in such 
cases on being satisfied that the person proposed is le- 
gally qualified. The appointment must be made with 
the consent of the person appointed. It is the generally accepted rule 
that any one is legally competent to be an administrator who is competent 
to make a contract. The relatives of the deceased are considered as en- 
titled to the appointment to administer the estate. 

If letters of administration should be unduly granted they may be re- 
voked. 

Administration may likewise be granted on certain conditions, for a cer- 
tain limited time, or for a special purpose. 

The powers and duties of an administrator differ from those of an exe- 
cutor only inasmuch as he must distribute and dispose of the entire es- 
tate according to the direction of the law, as he has no will to follow. 

The administrator must give bonds with sureties for the faithful execu- 
tion of his trust. 

Having liquidated all the debts of the intestate, the administrate 
divide the remainder of the assets among the surviving relatives of the 
deceased. In so doing, he will act under the direction of the court. 

AGENCY. 

By Agency is meant the substitution of one person by>nd for another, 
the former to transact business for the latter. An Agency may be estab- 
lished by implication an express agreement with a person that he is to 



ARBITRATION. 777 

become the agent of another not being necessary or verbally, or by writing. 
A. verbal creation of agency suffices to authorize the agent to make a con- 
tract even in cases where such contract must be in writing. 

Agency is of three different kinds : special, general, and professional. 
A special agency is an authority exercised for a special purpose. If a 
special agent exceed the limits of his authority, his principal is not bound 
by his acts. 

A general agency authorizes the transaction of all business of a particu- 
lar kind, or growing out of a particular employment. The principal will 
be bound by the acts of a general agent though the latter act contrary to 
private instructions, provided he keep, at the same time, within the gene- 
ral limits of his authority. 

Professional agents are those licensed by the proper authority to tran- 
sact certain kinds of business for a compensation. The following are 
among this class of agents : 

1. Attorneys. 

2. Brokers. 

3. Factors. 

4. Auctioneers. 

5. Masters of Ships. 

In regard to the subject of an agency, the general rule is that whatever 
a man may do in his own right, he may also transact through another. 
Things of a personal nature, implying personal confidence on the part of 
the person possessing them, cannot be delegated. 

Infants, married women, lunatics, idiots, aliens, and persons incapable 
of making legal contracts, cannot act as principals in the appointment of 
agents. Infants and married women may, however, become principals in 
certain cases. 

Agency may be terminated in two ways : (1) by the act of the princi- 
pal or agent; (2) by operation of law. In the latter case the termination 
of the agency is effected by lapse of time, by completion of the subject 
matter of the agency, by the extinction of the subject matter or by the in- 
sanity, bankruptcy, or death of either party. 

AEBITEATION. 

Arbitration is an investigation and determination of subjects of diff'-r- 
ence between persons involved in dispute, by unofficial persons chosen by 
the parties in question. 

The general rule is that any person capable of making a valid contract 
concerning the subject in dispute may be a party to an arbitration. Any 



778 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

matter which the parties may adjust by agreement, or which may be made 
the subject of a suit at law, may be determined by arbitration. Crimes 
cannot be made the subject matter of an arbitration. 

Questions may be submitted for arbitration in the following ways : 

1. By parol. 
. 2. By writing. 

3. Under the statute, which must be done if the parties are desirous of 
availing themselves of its provisions. (This is, where a suit is pending.) 

4. By rule of court, which occurs when an action is pending in court 
and the parties agree to take it before arbitrators, in accordance with an 
order of the court. 

5. By deposit of notes. 

A person may be selected as arbitrator, notwithstanding his natural in- 
capacity or legal disability to make contracts, 

The arbitrators must fix the time and place of hearing, and give due 
notice of the same to the parties. They must be sworn, if the statute re- 
quires an oath, unless such oath is waived by the parties themselves. In 
the matter of hearing evidence the statute must be followed. 

The arbitrators may adjourn from time to time, provided the time docs 
not extend beyond the period appointed for the delivery of the award. 

In arbitrations the parties are entitled to the aid of counsel, the same 
as they would be in court. 

After a fair submission and a legal award, the matter submitted cannot 
be litigated on, any more than if it had been settled by a judgment. 

An award may be impeached where it has been procured by corruption, 
fraud, or other undue means ; by misconduct, corruption or irregularity 
on the part of the arbitrators when the arbitrators acknowledge they have 
made a mistake in their decision ; where the arbitrators have exceeded their 
powers ; where pertinent and material evidence was rejected, etc. If 
either party revokes the submission, he will be liable for an action for 
breach of contract, and the payment of damages to the other party. 

AEEEST. 

The defendant in a civil action may be arrested under Revised Statutes 
(Ont.) cap. 67, also in an action wherein the judgment requires the perfor- 
mance of an act, the neglect or the refusal to perform which would be 
punishable by the court as contempt. 

The defendant, when arrested, may give bail. 



ATTACHMENT - CHATTEL MORTGAGES -CONTRACTS. 779 

ATTACHMENT. 

An attachment may be issued, when it is a question of recovering a sum 
of money, for damages, in the following cases : 

1. Under cap. 68, Revised Statutes, Ontario, and under the Common Law 
Procedure Act, Revised Statutes, Ontario, cap. 50. 

The plaintiff must prove that a cause of action exists under one of the 
above statutes, before he is entitled to a warrant of attachment. In case 
of an action to recover damages, his affidavit must show that he is entitled 
to recover a sum therein stated over and above any or all counter claims 
against him. In addition that he has left the Province with the intention 
of defrauding his creditors, or avoiding being served with a summons, or 
that he keeps himself concealed within the Province with like intent. If 
the defendant is a natural person or a domestic corporation, the affidavit 
must show that he or it has removed his or its property from the Province 
with the intention of defrauding his or its creditors, or that he has assign- 
ed, disposed of, or secreted his property, or that he is about to do so with 
like intent. 

CHATTEL MORTGAGES. 

A mortgage of goods and chattels will be void to creditors of the mort- 
gagee, if the following conditions are not complied with : 

1. The filing of the mortgage, or a true copy thereof, as required by law 
in the County Court clerk's office of the town, city or county where the 
mortgagor resides, and where the property lies at the time the instrument 
was executed, if he is a resident of the Province ; if not, it must be filed in 
the city or town where the property is located at the time of the execution 
of the mortgage. 

2. The mortgage not being filed within five days from the execution 
thereof. 

CONTRACTS. 

The conditions of a contract, as .applying to individuals, are: 1. Age; 
2. Rationality ; and 3, as to Corporations, the possession of general or spe- 
cial statutory powers. 

Persons under age are incompetent to make contracts, except under cer- 
tain limitations. Generally such persons are incapable of making binding 
contracts. 

As to rationality', the general principle of law is that all persons not 
rendered incompetent by personal disability, or by considerations of public 
policy, are capable of making a contract. 



780 THE HOME, FARM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPAEDIA. 

Corporations have powers to make contracts strictly within the limits 
prescribed by their charters, or by special or general statute. The following- 
classes of contracts are void, unless they shall be in writing and subscribed 
by the party to be charged thereby : 

1. Every agreement that by its terms is not to be performed within one 
year from the making thereof. 

2. Every special promise to answer for the debts, default, or miscarriage 
of another person. 

3. Every agreement, promise or undertaking, made upon consideration 
of marriage, except mutual promise to marry. 

4. Every contract for the leasing of a longer period than one year, or 
for the sale of any lands, or any interest in lands, shall be void, unless the 
contract, or some note or memorandum thereof, expressing the consider- 
ation, be in writing and subscribed by the party by whom the lease or sale 
is made. 

INTEEEST AND USUKY. 

Interest is a moderate profit for the use of money. In the Dominion the 
rate of interest is established by statute. Six per cent, is the legal rate of 
interest. An excess of interest above the legal rate may be recovered by 
an action at law. 

LIEN LAWS. 

Any one who, as contractor, sub-contractor, or labourer, performs any 
work, or furnishes any materials, in pursuance of, or in conformity with, 
any agreement or contract with the owner, lessee, agent, or one in posses- 
sion of the property, toward the erection, altering, improving, or repairing 
of any building, shall have a lien for the value of such labour or materials 
on the building or land on which it stands, to the extent of the right, title 
and interest of the owner, lessee or person in possession at the time of the 
claimant's filing his notice with the Registrar of Deeds of the County 
where the property is situated. 

This notice should be filed within thirty days after completion of the 
work, or the furnishing of the materials, and should state the residence of 
the claimant, the amount claimed, from whom due, when due, and to ; 
whom due, the namo of the person against whom claimed, the name of the 
owner, lessee or person in possession of the premises, with a brief descrip- 
tion of the latter. 

Liens cease in ninety days after the filing of the notice, unless an action 
is begun, or the lien is continued by an order of Cjurt. 

The following classes of persons are generally entitled to lien: 






LIMITATION OF ACTION- -WHEN A DEBT IS OUTLAWED. 781 

1. Bailees, who may perform labour and services on the thing bailed, at 
the request of the bailor. 

2. Innkeepers, upon the baggage of guests they have accommodated. 

3. Common carriers, upon goods carried, for the amount of their freight 
and disbursements. 

4. Vendors on the goods sold for payment of the price where no credit 
has been expressly promised or implied. 

5. Agents, upon goods of their principals, for advancements for the bene- 
fit of the lattei'. 

6. All persons are entitled to the right of lien who are compelled by law 
to receive property, and bestow labour or expense on the same. 

The right of lien may be waived : 

1. By express contract. 

2. By neglect. 

3. By new agreement. 

4. By allowing change of possession. 

5. By surrendering possession. 

The manner of the enforcement of a Hen, whether it be an innkeeper's, 
agent's, carrier's, factor's, etc., depends wholly upon the nature and char- 
acter of the lien. 

LIMITATION OF ACTION-WHEN A DEBT IS OUTLAWED. 

Actions upon judgments or decrees of a court, or a contract under seal, 
or for the recovery of real estate, must be commenced within a period of 
ten years from the date when the cause of action accrued. 

All actions upon unsealed contracts, express or implied, become out- 
lawed in six years. 

Claims for damages to property become outlawed in six years. 

Claims for the specific recovery of personal property and on judgments 
of courts not of record, are outlawed in six years. 

In the case of enforcing the payment of a bill, note, or other evidence of 
debt that may be issued by a moneyed corporation, or to enforce the pay- 
ment of same issued or put in circulation as money, there is no limitation 
of time to sue. 

An acknowledgement or new promise cannot take a contract or other 
liability out of the statute of outlawry, unless it be in writing. 

A payment on account of principal or interest takes the case out of the 
statute, without being in writing. 



782 



THE HOME, FAKM AND BUSINESS CYCLOPJF.DIA. 



NOTES AND BILLS OF EXCHANGE. 

Notes are, as a rule, entitled to three days' grace that is, the note is 
not payable till the third day after the day expressed for its payment. 
Notes made payable " on demand " are not entitled to grace. 

In the following cases there are no days of grace : 

1. Bills of exchange or drafts, payable at sight at any place within the 
Dominion shall be deemed due and shall be payable on presentation, with- 
out the allowance of any days' grace. 

2. Checks, bills of exchange or drafts appearing on their face to have been 
drawn upon any bank, or banking association, or banker, carrying on 
binking business under the act to authorize tha business of banking, 
which are on their face payable oa any specified day, or in any numbar of 
days after the date or sight thereof, shall be deemed due and payable on 
the day mentioned for paymsnt of same without any days of grace being 
allowed nor shall it be necessary to protest the same for non-acceptanca. 

When the last of the days of grace falls on Sundoy, or any leading pub- 
lic holiday when general business is suspended, the presentment for pay- 
ment must be made on the Saturday preceding the Sunday, or the day pre- 
ceding the holiday. 

As a general rule, the note or bill must be presented for payment on 
the last of the days of grac3, and the drawers and endorsers must be noti- 
fied of non-payment not later than the following day. 

Notes and bills, when made payable to or at any person's order and en- 
dorsed in blank, pass by delivery. 

The words " value received," though ordinarily used, are not indispen- 
sable, as value is held to be implied. 

Notes do nob bear interest except when it is so stated. After maturity 
all notes bear legal interest. 

The holder of a note that is made payable to order may sue in his own 

name. 

A promissory note given by a minor is void. 

The indorser of an accommodation is a surety for the maker, and he is 
liable to the costs of collection that may be brought against such maker 

or indorser. 

Any promise to pay, without specifying the time of payment, is equiva-

PARTNERSHIP. 



PAETNERSHIP. 



783 



The general rule is that every person of sound mind, and not otherwise 
restrained by law, may enter into a contract of partnership. 

There are several kinds of partners, which may be classed as follows : 

1. Ostensible partners, or those whose names are made public as part- 
ners, and who in reality are such, and who take all the benefits and risks. 

2. Nominal partners, or those who appear before the public as partners, 
but who have no real interest in the business. 

3. Dormant, or silent partners, are those whose names are not known 
or do not appear as partners, but who, nevertheless, have an interest in 
the business. 

Special partners, or those who are interested in the business only to the 
amount of the capital they have invested in it. 

5. General partners, who manage the business, while the capital, either 
in whole or in part, is supplied by a special partner or partners. They 
are liable for all the debts and contracts of the firm. 

A nominal partner renders himself liable for all the debts and contracts 
of the firm. 

A dormant partner, if it becomes known that he has an interest, whe- 
ther creditors trusted the firm on his account or not, becomes liable 
equally with the other partners. 

The partnership firm is responsible for any acts done by any partner, 
touching the partnership business. 

The representation or misrepresentation of any fact made by any part- 
ner within the scope of the business, is binding on the firm. 

A notice to or by any of the firm is deemed a notice to or by all of 
them. 

Each partner is liable to third parties for the whole partnership debt. 

The articles of partnership must in all cases be in writincr.

The above table gives the number of days intervening between any day , 
in any month to a similar date in any other month. To ascertain these 
intervening days, run the eye along the line designated by title of the 
month on the left hand, until it reaches its intersection by the column 
headed at the top, by the month in which the note matures, and the figures 
at the angle denote the number of days from the first of the respective 
months. To this, add the day upon which the note matures, and from the 
sum subtract the date of the month from which it is reckoned. 

EXAMPLE. A note falling due June 20th, is offered for discount on March 10th ; wanted, the 
number of days intervening before maturity. 

The figures at the angle give 92

In reference to tile-pipe drains, it must be remembered that the 
-diu-h may be much narrower than when stones are used, thus nuk- 
ing a considerable saving in the expense of digging. The ii]i]x-r piirt 

e earth is taken out with a c imon spade, and the lower part 

with one made quite narrow for the purpose, being only about four 
inches wide at the point. 



Facts About Weeds, 

Ir. I.indley estimates as a low average 
the followin!: number of seeds from each of 
these four plants : 

1 plant of Groundsel produces 2,080} 
1 " Dandelion " 2,740 ( 16,400 
1 " Sow Thistle " 11,040 ~ plants 
1 " Spurge 540,1 

or enough seed from these four plants to 
cover three acres and a half, at three feet 
apart. To hoe this land, he says, will cost, 
.(is. (sterling) PIT acre, and hence a man 
throws away r.s. :M. a time, as often as he 
.neglects to bend his back to pull up a 
young weed before it begins to fulfil the 
first law of nature. He recommends every 
farmer, whose vertebral column will not 
bend, to count the number of dandelions, 
sow thistles, etc., on the first square rod 
he can measure off. 

This operation may be repeated in Ibis 
country by applying all the above estimates 
to pig-weed, burdock, fox-tail, chick-weed, 
and purslane.

MISCELLANEOUS TABLES.

Measuring Land. 

Farmers often desire to lay off small 
portions of land for the purpose of experi- 
menting with manures, crops, etc. ; but 
sometimes find difficulty in doing it cor- 
rectly, for the lack of a few simple rules. 
The following table and accompanying ex- 
planation, which we copy from the New 
England Farmer, carefully studied, will 
make the whole matter perfectly clear. 

ONE ACRE CONTAINS 

100 square rods ; 4,840 square yards ; 43,- 
50 J square feet. 

ONE ROD CONTAINS 

30-25 square yards ; 272'25 square feet. 
One square yard contains nine square feet. 

THE SIDE OF A SQUARE TO CONTAIN 

One acrs 203-71 feet 12-65 rods 64 pices 

One-half acre 147-58 " 8-94 " 45 ' 

One-thirilacre....l20r,0 " ....730 " ....37 ' 

One-fourth acre.. 104-36 " 6 3l> " 32 ' 

One-eighth acre .. 73-79 " .... 4 47 " 22J " 

20S-71 feet. 



208 71 feet. 

It will be seen by reference to the plan 
that a practice sometimes followed by far- 
mers is very erroneous ; if the side of a 
square containing one acre measures 
20871, one-half that length will not make 
a square containing one-half an acre, but 
only one-fourth of an acre, and one-third 
the length of line will enclose a square of 
one-ninth an acre, and one-fourth the line 
squared, will contain one-sixteenth an 
acre, and so on. 

Garden Seeds for Half an Acre. 

The following seeds, with judicious 
management, will fully crop a garden of 



half an acre, which will supply a moder- 
ate-sized family with vegetables through- 
out the year. Vegetable seeds, where 
carefully grown in this country, are (with 
a few exception*) preferable to those im- 
ported ; but the utter c irelessness mani- 
fested by many in keeping them apart 
when growing is not to be recommended.

Seeds should always be kept in bags, in 
a dry, airy situation. Wall closets and 
cellars are objectionable, from their damp- 
ness. All seeds will keep two, and many 
from three to six years. 

How to lay off a Square Acre. 

Measure 209 feet on each side, and you 
have a square acre within an inch. 

Box Measures. 

Farmers and market gardeners will find 
a series of box measures very useful ; and 
they can readily be made by any one who 
understands the two-foot rule, and can 
handle the saw and hammer. The follow- 
ing measurements, it will be seen, vary 
slightly from the regular bushel adopted 
by some of the countries, but are suffici- 
ently accurate for all ordinary purposes : 

A box 1C by 10^ inches square, and 
eight inches deep, will contain a bushel, 
or 2150.4 cubic inches, each inch in depth 
holding one gallon. 

A box 24 by 11.2 inches square, and 8- 
inches deep, will also contain a bushel or 
2150.4 cubic inches, each inch in depth 
holding one gallon. A box 12 by 11 .2 inches 
square, and 8 inches deep, will contain 
half a bushel, or 1075.2 cubic inches, each 
inch in depth holding half a gallon. 

A box 8 by 8.4 inches square, and 8 
inches deep, will contain half a peck, or 
298.8 cubic inches. The gallon, dry mea- 
sure. 

A box 4 by 4 inches square, and 4 2 
inches deep, will contain one quart, or 
67. 2 cubic inches.
