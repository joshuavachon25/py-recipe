TO THE 



RE A D E R. 



T Bdieve tbave attempted a branch of^ Cookery'^ 
which nobody has yet thought worth their white 
to write upon : but as I have botbfeen^ and founds 
by experiences that the generality of fervants are 
greatly wanting in that pointy therefore I have, 
taken upon me to inftruH them in the beji manner I 
am capable i and, I dare fay% that every fervant 
niQbo can but read will be capable of making a toler^ 
able good cookf and thofe who have the leajl notion 

of Cookery cannot mifs ^^ being very good ones. 

» t • 

if 1 have not wrote in the high polite Jlyle, I hope 
I Jhall be forgiven ; for my intention is to infiruSf 
the lower forty and therefore muf treat them in their 
own wayi For example : when I bid them lard a 
fowl, if IJhould bid them lard with large lardoons^ 
they would not kr^owrfwhat I meant i but when I fay 
they muji lard with ^little puces ofbacoff^ they know, 
what I me aft. So, in many other things in Cookery , 
the great cooks havefuch a hi^h way ofexprejjtng

tbemfehes^ that the poor girls are at alofsto kno^g 

ffjohat they n^eaji : and in all Receipt Books yet 

print edi there arejuck m pdd jumble of things a^ 

would quite fpoil a good di(h ; and indeed fom 

things fo extravagant^ that it would be almojl q 

Jloaffie to makf uje oftbmy whep a difh C(}n be made 

full as goodi or better^ without them. For ex^fiir 

pie : when you entertain ten or twelve people, you 

. /hall ufe for a cullis, a leg of veal and a ham ; 

' which % Wfh^ tf)e other ingredients 9 ma^ef it very 

expejifive^ and all this only to mix iipith other fauch. 

And again %, the ejerfce of ham for fduce to ope di(b ; 

when I will prove ityfotr about three Jhillings Iwilf 

.-. make as rich and high a fauce as all that will be, 

when done. For example ; 

Take a large deep ftew-pan, half a pound of 
bacon, fat and lean together, cut the fat and lay 
it over the bottom of the pan \ then take a pound 
of veal, cut it into thin flices, beat it well with 
the back of a knife, lay it all over the bacpn j then 
liave fix-penny tvorth of the coarfe lean part of 
thp beef cut thin and well be^it, lay a layer of it 
all over, with fome carrot, then the lean of the 
bacon cut thin and laid over that : then cut two 
onions and ftrew over, a bundle of fweet-herbs, 
four or five blades of mace, fijcpr feven cloves, a 
fpoonful.of wjiole pepper, blatk and white toge- 
^ ther, half a nutnieg beat, a pigeon beat all to 
pieces, lay that all over, half an dunce of truffles

find morels, then the reft of your beef, agoddcriift 
of bread toafted very brown and dry on both fides : 
you may add an old cock beat to pieces ; cover 
it ciofe, and let it (land over a (low fire two or 
three minutes, then pour on boiling iva^er enough 
to fill the pan, cover it clofe, and let it (lew till it 
is as rich as you would have it, and then ftralfi 
off all that faucc, Put all your ingredients toge- 
ther again^ (ill the pan with bbiling water, put in ^ 
a fre(h onion, a blade; dfmace, and a piece of 
carrot i cover it cIo(e, and let it (lew till it is as 
llrong as you want it. This will be full as good 
as the e(icnce of ham for all forts of fowls, or in- 
deed mo(i made-di(hes, ndixed with a glafs of^ - - 
winfe, drid two or three fpoonf'uls of catchups 
When yoiir fird grivy is cool, ikini o(FaUthefatj 
and keep it for ufc. — ^'-^Thh falls far Jhort of the 
expence of a leg of veal and banti and anfwers every 
purpofe you want* 

ifydii go io rHarkei^ the ingredients iJoili riot come 
to, above half a croion, or for about eighteen-pence 
you may make as much good gravy as will ferve 
twenty people • 

Take twelve pcnny-wofth of coarfc lean beef, 
tvhich will be fix or feVen pounds, cut it all to 
pieces, flour it well, take a quarter of a pound oF 
good butter, put it iiito a little pot or large deep 
ftew-pin, and put in youf beef : keep (lirring it, 
and when it begins to look a little brown, pour 

A3 itf

To the READER 



in a pint of boiling water ; flir it all together, put 
in a large onion, a bundle of fweet herSs, two 
.or three -blades of mace, five or fix cloves, a 
fpoonful of whole pepper^ a cruft of bread toaft- 
cd, and a piece of carrot ; then pour in four or 
five quarts of water, (lir all together, cover clofe, 
and let it flew till it is as rich as you would have 
it I when enough, ftrain it off, mix it with two 
or three fpooftfuls of catchup, and half a piritof 
whit^ wine; then put all the ingredients together 
.again, and put in two quarts of boiling water, 
cover it clofe, and let it boil till there is about a 
•pmt; ftrain it oiFv/ell, add it to the firft^ and 
grve it a boil together, * This vvill inake a great 
deal of rich good gravy. * 

« 

Tou may leave out the wine, according to nvbaf 
ufe you want it for ; fo that really one might have 
a genteel entertainment ^ for the price thefauce of 
me dijh comes to : but if gentlemen "will have 
French cooks, they mufi pay for French tricks. . 

A Frenchman in his own country njoilVdrefs a 
fine dinner of twenty dijhes^ and all genteel and pret- 
ty, for the expence he will put an Engli{h lord to for 
dr^ng one diJh. But then there is the little petty 
profit. I have heard of a cook that ufe d fix pounds of 
butter to fry twelve eggs \ when every body knowjr 
'{that ^nderfiands cooking) that half a pound is full 
.'enough, or more than need be ufed: but then it

To the k£ADER. f 

^ouM not ie Frencli; So much is the blind folly of 
this age J that they 'would rather be impofed on by a 
'French booby ^ than give encouragetHent ti a good 
Englifli cdoltl 

> 

I doubt I pall not gain the efieem ofthofe gentler 
men ,• however^ let that be as it will^ it little cm^ 
terfks me ; but Jhould I be fo happy as to gain tbi 
goodoptnioh of my own feXy Idefre no more ; that . 
will be a full recompence for all my trouble j and I 
only begtbefavoiir of every lady to read my Book 
throughout before they cenfure me, and then I flatter 
myfelf I JhaH have their approbation. 



IJballnot take upon me to meddle in the phyflca$ 
way farther than iivd receipts, which will beofufe 
to the public in general : one isfpr the bite of a mad 
dog : and the other ^ if a man would be near where 
jthe plague is, he jhall be in no danger ; which, if 
made_ ufe of would be found of very great feriiict 

to tbofe who go abroad. 

* I 

Nor Jhall I take upon me to direSi a lady in the 
^economy of her family i for every mijirefsdoes, or at 
leaft ought to know, what is moft proper to be done 
there ; therefore I Jhall not fill my Book with a 
deaj ofnonfenfe of that kind, which I am very well 
tijfured none will have regard to.

THE 

ART of COOKERY, 



^ 



MADE 



PLAIN and EASY. 

. C H A p. I. 

CyROASTINC, BOILINO^ ^C. 

THAT prorefied cooks will find fault with touching upon 
a branch af coolcery which ihey never thought worth 
their notice, is what I expert : however, this I know, 
it is the moll necelTary part of it } and few fervants there are, 
tbat know how to loaft and boil to perfection. ■ 

I do not pretend to teach profelTed coolt&, but my delign U to 
ii)ftm£l the ignorant and unlearned (which will likewife be of 
great ufe in all private famBies) and in fo plain and full a man- 
ner; that the moft illiterate and ignorant peifon, vfho can but 
read, wilt' know how to do every thing in cookery well. 

I (hall firft btfgin with roaft and boiled of all forts, and muft 
defire the cook to order her iire according to what fhe is to 
drc& i if any thing very little or thin, then a pretty little briflc 
fire, that it may be done quicic and nice; if a very large joint, 
then be fure a good fire be laid to cake. Let it be clear at the 
bottom } and when yout meat is half done, move the diipping- / 
B pan ' 



-2 7'he Art of Cookefy^ ' 

pan and fpit a little from the fire, and fiir up a good brifk fire f . 
for according to the goodnefs of your fire, your meat will be 
done fooner or later. 

BEEF. 

IF beef, be fure to paper the top, and bafie it well all tbc 
time it is roafiing, and throw ^ handful of fait on it. When 
you fee the fihoke draw to the fire, it is near enough ; then 
take off the paper, bade it well, and drudge it with a little flour 
to make a fine froth. Never fait your roaft meat before you 
lay it to the fire, for that draws out all the gravy. If you 
would keep it a few days before you drcfe it, dry it very well 
with a clean cloth, then flour it all over, and hang it where the 
air will come to it ; but be fure always to mind that there is no 
damp place about it, if there is you mufl: dry it well with a 
cl6th. Take up your meat, and garnifh your diih with nothing 
but bdrfe-raddifli. 

MUTTOT^ and LAMB. 

AS to roafting of mutton ^ the loin, the faddle of mutton 
'^ which is the two loins) and the chine (which is the two necks) 
muft be done as the beef above. But all other forts of mutton 
and Iamb muft be roafied with a quick clear fire, and without 
paper ; bafte it when you lay it down, and j^uft befpre you take 
it up^ drudge it with a little flour ; but be fure not to ufe too 
much, for that tak^s away all the fine tafte of the meat. Some 
chufe to fkih a Toin of mutton, and roaft it brown without 
paper : bpt that you may do juft as you pleafe, but be fure al- 
ways to take the (kin off a breaft of muttotkt 

VEAL. 

AS to veal, you muft be careful to rdaft it of a fine brown 5 
if a large joint, a very good fire ; if a fmall joint, a pretty little 
brifk fire; if a fillet or loin, be fure to paper the fat, that you 
lofe as little of that as poflible. Lay it fome diftance from the 
fire till it is foaked, then lay it near the fire. When you lay 
it down, bafte it well with good butter; and.when it is near 
enough, bafte it again, and drudge it with a Jittle flour. The 
breaft ycu muft roaft with the caul on till it is enough ; and 
'ficewer the fweetbread on the backfide of the breaft. When it 
is mgh enough^ take off the caul^ bafte it, and drudge it with 
a little flour. 
V P V RK. 



madi Plain and Eafy^ ,% 

PORK. 

JP O R K muft be well done, or it is apt to furjTeit. When 
you roaft a loin, take a (harp penknife and cut the ikin acrofs, 
to make the crackling eat the better. The chine you muft not 
cut at alU The beft way to roaft a leg, is firft to parboil it, 
then iktn it and roaft \k ; bafte it with butter, then take a little 
fage, (bred it fine, a little pepper and fait, a little nutmeg, and 
a few crumbs of bread ; throw tbefe* over it all the time it is 
roafting, then have a little drawn gravy to put in the difh with 
the crumbs that drop from it. Some love the knuckle ftufFcd 
with onion and fage (bred fmall, with a little pepper and fa!t» 
gravy and apple- fauce to it. This they call a mock goofe^ 
The fpring, or hand of pork, if very young, roafted like ia pig» 
eats very well, other wife it is better boiled. The fparerib 
ihould be bafted with a little bit of butter, a very little duft of 
flour, and fome fage ihred fmail : but we never make any fauce 
to it but apple-fauce. The beft way to dre(s pofk griflcins is 
to roaft them, bafte them with a little butter and crumbs of 
bread, fage, and a little pepper and fait. Few eat any thing 
with tbefe bat muftard. ^ 

To Toafi a pig. 

SPIT your pig and lay it td the fire, which muft be a very 
good one at each end, or hang a flat iron in the middle of the 
grate. Before you lay your pig down, take a little fage (bred 
iinall, a piece of butter as big as a walnut, and a little pepper 
and fait $ put them into the pig and few it up with co^rfe thread, 
then flour it all over very well, and keep flouring it till the eyes 
drop out, or you find the crackling hard. Be fure to fave all the 
gravy that comes out of it, which you muft do bytfetting bafons 
or pans under the pig in the dripping-pan, as foon as you find 
the gravy begins to run. When the pig is enough, ftir the fire 
up bri(k; take a coarfe cloth, with about a quarter of a pound 
of butter in it, and rub the pig all over till the crackling is quite 
crifp, and then take it up. Lay it in your difli« and with a (harp 
knife cut off the head, and then cut the pig in two, before you 
draw out the fpit. Cut the ears off the head and lay at each 
end, and cut the under-jaw in two and lay on each fide : melt 
fome good butter, take the gravy you faved and put into it, 
boil it, and pour it into the di(h with the brains bruifed fine, 
and the fage mixed all together, and then fend it to table,

"4, Th Art of Cookery^ 

Different forts of fauce for a pig. 

NOW you arc to obfervc there are feveral ways of making 
fauce for a pig. Some don't love any fage in the pig, only a 
cruft of bread; -but then you (hould have a little dried fage 
Tubbed and mixed with the gravy and butter. Some love bread- 
fauce in a bafon; made thus: take a pint of water, put in a 
good piece of crumb of bread, a blade of mace, and a little 
ivbole pe))per ; boil it for about five or fix minutes, and then 
pour the water ofT: take out the fpice, and beat up the 'bread 
with a good piece of butter. Som^ love a few currants boiled 
in it, a glafs of wine, and a little fugar : but that you muildo 
juft as you like it. Others take half a, pint of good beef gravy, 
and the gravy which comes out of the pig, with a piece of 
.buttef rolled in flojur, two fpoonfuls of catchup, and boil them 
all together; then take the brains of the pig and bruife them 
fine, with two eggs boiled hard and chopped ; put all thefe 
together, with the fage in the pig, and pour into your di(h« 
It is a very good fauce. When you have not gravy enough 
comes out of your pig with the butter for fauce, take about 
s^alf a pint of veal gravy and add to it : or flew the petty-toes, 
and take as much of that liquor as will do for fauce, mixed with 
the other. 

^0 roaft the bind quarter of pigj lamh-fafhion. 

AT the time of the year when houfe-lamb is very dear, 
take the hind quarter of a large pig ; take ofF the fkin and 
roaft it, and it will eat like lamb with mint- fauce, or with a

little chicken will be done in fifteen minutes, a large chickea 
in twehty minutes, a good fowl in half an hour, a little turkey 
or goofe in an bottr, and a large turkey in an hour and a

Sauce for a bailed turky. 

THE beft fauce (o a boiled turkey is this : take a little Water^ 
or mutton gravy, if you have it, a bl^de of mace, an onion, a 
little bit of thyme, a little bit of leqion-peel, and an anchovy; 
boil all thefe together, ftrain them through a (ieve, melt Tome

put them into a^aucepan, juft (hake a little flour over them, 
put in a little milk or cream, with a good piece of butter ; fet 
them over the fire, and when the butter is melted they are 
enough. But if you would have onion fauce in half an hour, 
take your oniona, peel them, and cut them in thin flices, put 
thenl into milk and water, and when the water boils they will 
be done in twenty minutes^ then throw them into a cullender

but you muft bake it, flour it very well, and rub it all over 
with butter, and when it is near enough, draw it to the oven's 
mouth, rub it dry, and put it in again for a few minutes ; lay 
it in the difh, and let the fauce be fmall gravy and butter in

THE beft way to roaft a turkey is to loofen the (kin on the 
breaft or the turkey, and fill .it with force-meat made thus : 
take a quarter of a pound of beef-fuet, as many crumbs of 
bread, a little lemon peel, an anchovy, fome nutmeg, pepper^ 
parfley, and a little thyme. Chop and beat them all well toge- 
ther,' niix them with the yolk of an egg, and fiuiF up the bfcaft j^ 
when you have no fuet, butter will do : or you may make youi: 
fbrce*meat thus : Spread bread and butter thin, and grate fome 
nutmeg over it : when you have enough roll it up, and JRuiTthe 
breaft of the turkey ; then roaft it of a fine brown, but be fure to 
pin fome white paper on the breaft till it is near enough. You 
muft have good gravy in thediOi, and bread fauce made thus: 
take a good piece of crumb, put it Into a pint of water, with a 
blade or two of m<gce, two or three cloves, and fome whole pep* 
per. BcnI it up five or fix times, their with a fpoon take out 
the fpice you had before put in, and then you muft pour oilF the 
water (ycfu may boil an otiion in it if you pleafe) ^ thenbeat tip 
the bresid with a good piece of butter and a little fait; or ohion*^ 
fauce, made thus : take fome onions, peel them and cut then' 
into thin dices, and boil them half an hour in milk and water; 
then drain the water from them and beat them up with a good 
piece of butter ; (hake a little flour in, and ftir it altogether 
wirh a little cream, if you have it, (or milk will do) ; put the 
fauce into boats, and garniih with lemon.

i&jnd as to 'brown fauce, take great care no fat fwuns at the 

<op, but that it be all fmooth alike, and about as thick as good 

creamy and not to tafte of one thing more than Smother. As to 

pepper and fait, feafon to your palate, but do not put too much 

cf cither, for that will take away the fine flavour of every thing. 

* As to moft made diflies, you may put in what you think proper; 

to enlarge it, or make it good; as mufhrooms pickled, dried, 

frefli, or powdered ; trufiies, morels, cocks-combs ftewed, ox 

palates cut in little bits, artichoke -bottom^s, either pickled, freflji 

boiled, or dried ones foftened in warm water, each cut in foiir 

pieces, afparagus-tops, the yollyf hard eggs, force-meat balls,

Xo drefs Fish. 

AS to boiled fi(h of all forts, you have full direflions in the 
Lent chapter. But here we can fry fifh much better, becaufe 
we have beef-dripping, or hog's lard. 

Obferve always in the frying of any fort of fifli ; firft, that 
you dry your fifli very well in a clean cloth, then flour it. . Let 
your ftew-pan you fry them in be very nice and clean, and put 
in as much beef-dripping, or hog's lard, as will almoft cover 
your fifli s and be fure it boils before you put in your fifh. Let It 
fry quick, and let it be of a fine light brown, but not too dark a 
colour. Have your fifh-flice ready, and if there is occafion tura 
it: when it is enough, taice it up, and lay a coarfe cloth on a 
difli, on which lay your fifh, to drain all the greafe from it ; if 
you fry parfley, do it quick, and take great care to whip it out 
of the pan as foon as it is crifp, or it will lofe its fine colour. 
Take great care that your drfpping be very nice and clean. You 
have diiedipns in the eleventh chapter, how to make it fit for 
ufe, and have it always in readjnefs. 

Sorhe love fifh in batter j then you mufl beat an egg fine, 
and dip your fifh in juft as you are going to put it in the pan ; 
or as good a batter as any, is a little ale and flour beat up, juft 
as you are ready for it, and dip the fifh, to fry it. 

Fijh'fauce with lobfter. 

FOR falmon or turbot, broiled pod or haddock, &c. nothing 
is better than fine butter melted thick; and take a lobfler, 
bruife the body of the lobfter in tbe butter, and cut the flefbi 

. into 



jiita littte ptecc8.; ilov it all together, apd give it .a. Vf^j]. If 
yoa would have your fi^uce very rich, jet pne half be,rich beef- 
gravy, and the other half melted butter with th&lobftier j but 
the gravy, I tbiok^ takes away the fweetneft of the, butter, and 
lobifter, and the fine flavour of the iifli. 

TAKE a pjnt of beef-gravy, and' half a pint of fhrlilips, 
thicken h with a good piece of butter rolled in flour. Let the 
gl^vy be well feafoned, and let it bojl. '

oyfters are fine and plump, ihencarefMlfy'with a fork takeoaut 
the*oyfters from the liquor and fpice, and let the liquor boil 
iiVe or fix minutes ; then ftrain the liquor, waih out theXai^^p- 
pan clean, and put the oyfters and liquor in the fauce-pan 
again, with half a pint of gravy, and half a pound of butter 
juft rolled in a little flour. You may put in two fpoonfuls of 
white wine, ke^ it ftirring till the fauce boils^ and all the 
buttec is nteited* 

To make anchavy-faucje. 

TAKE a pint of gravy, put in an anchovy, take a qqarter of

you would have the fauce white, put in white-wine, and good 
' urong'veaiwgravy, with the above ingredients. DreflTed as it) ^he / 
Lent chapteri'is full as good, if your beer is not bitter. 

As to drefling a pike^and all other fi(h, you have it in the Lent 
chapter ; only this, 'when you drefs them with a pudding, you 
ii)ay add a littlp be^f-fuet cij^t very fine, and good gravy in the

very clean and free from all greaie and fand, and that th^y foe 
well tinned, for fear of giving tne broths and foups any brafly 
tafte* If you have time to fiew as fofciy %\ you can, it will 
both have a Hner flavour, and the meat will be tenderer* .But then 
obferve^ when you make foups of broths for prefent u(e, if it is 
to be done fofdy, don't put much more water than you intend 
to have foii>p or broth \ and if you have the convenience of an 
earthen pan or pipkin, fet it on wood embers till it boils, 
then fkim it, and put in your feafbning; cover it clofe, and fet 
k on embers, fo that it may do very foftly for fome time, an4 
both the meat and t»roth$ wrU be delicious. You muftobferve 
in all broths and foups that one thing does not tafte more Aaii 
-another ; but that the tafte be equal, and h ha^ a flne agree*

and cut it as near the fhape of your pot as you can. Take two 
nutmegs, an ounce of mace ana cloves beaten^ half an ounce of 
white pepper, and an ounce of fait ; then take out all the bones,

oven, let it ftand half an hour; then uncover it, and raife it up 
at one end, that the gravy may run out, then put a trencher 
and a weight on it to^prefs out the gravy. When the butter is 
cold, take it out clear from the* gravy, addl fome more to it,

more or Icfs. 

N. B. Always take great care that no gravy or whey of the 
butter is left in the potting ; if there is, it will not keep.

directions for the cQok» or nurfe^ I prefume, will not be im** 
{proper, to make fuch a diet, &c. as the dodtor fliall order, 

J'o make mutim hroib. 

TAKE a pound of a loin of mutton, take off the fat, put to 
it one quart of waier, let it boil and (kirn it well ; then put 
in a good piece of upper-cruft of bread, and one large blade of 
mace. Cover it clofe, and let it boil flowly an hour; don't ftir 
it, but pour the )>roth clear off. Seafon it with a little fait, and 
the mutton will be fit to eat. If you boil turnips, don't boil 
them in the broth, but by themfelves in another fai^ce-pan* 

To toil a fcrag of veaU 

$.ET on the fcrag in a clean fauce-^pan : to tacb pound of vca! 
put a quart of water, Ikim it very clean, then put in a good 
piece of upperrCiruft, a blade of mace to each pound, and a little 
parflcy tied with a thread. Cover it clofe ; then let it boil very 
foftly two hours, and both broth and meat will be fit to eat. 

31? make beef^ or mutton broth for very weak peofle^ who 

take but little nourijhment. 

TAKE a pound of beef, or mutton, or both together: to a 
pound put two quarts of water, firft flcin the meat and take off 
all the fat ; then cut it into little pieces, and boil it till it comes 
to a quarter* of a pint. Seafon it with a very little corn of fait*.- 
fkim off all the fat, and give a fpoonful of this broth at a time/ 
To very weak people, half a fpoonful is enough ; to feme a tea- 
fpoonful at a time ^ and to others a teacup full. There is 
greater nourifliment from tbi^ than kr^f thing elfe^

To boil a chicken. 

LETyotrrfauce-pati bevery clean and nice; when the water 
boils put In your chicken, which muft be very nicely picked 
and clean, and laid in coM wateT a qxianer-of an bour before it 
is boiled ; then take it out ofthe Water boiling, and lay it in ^ 
]i^lirter-dift. Save alUhc liquor that rufis from it in the dfJb', 
<fut up ybur chicken all in joints in the difli ; then bfuii^ the 
Kver very fine', add a little boiled parfley chopped very fine, a 
Vtpry little fait, and a very little grated nutmeg : mix it alt weH 
together with- two fpoonfVils of 'the liquor of "the fowl, and poixr 
it into the di(b with the reft of the liquor in the difh. If there

A pickle for pork which is to be eatfobn. 

, You muft take lito gallons of ^pump-water, one, pound of 
Wy-falt, one, pound of coarfe fligar^ fix ounces of fak-petre ^ 
lx>U it all together, atKl fkim it when cold. Cut the pork in 
-what pieces you pleafe^ lay it dowh clofe, and pour the liquor 
over it. Lay a weight on it to keep it clofe, and cover it clofe 
froflhthe air, arid it wilt be fit to ufe in a week. If you find' 
the pickle begins to ^poil, boil it again, and (kim it^ when ic \i 
cold, pout it on your pork again. 

To make veal hams. 

CUT the leg of veal like a ham^ then take a pint of bay-falt^ 
two dunces of falt-petre, and a pound of common falt;/niii^ 
them together, with an ounce of juniper-berries beat ; rub thef 
ham well^ and lay it in a hollow tray, with the fkinny iide 
downwards. Bafte it every day with the pickle for a fortnight,^ 
and then hang it in Wood-fmoke for a fortnight. Yon may 
boil it, or parboil it and roaft it. In this pickle you may dof 
i#o or three tongues, or a piece of pork.' 

To make heef bams . 

YOU muft take the leg of a fat, but fmall beef, the fat Scotcfit 
oi: Welch cattle is beft, and cut it ham-fafhioh. Take art 
ounce of bay-falt) an ounce of falt-petre, a pound of common' 
fait, and a pound of Coarfe fugar (this quantity for about four- 
teen or fifteen pounds weight, and fo accordingly, rf you pickle 
the whole quarter) riib it with the above ingredients, turn \t 
every dayi and bafte it well with the pickle for a month : take 
it out and roll it in bran or faw-difft, then hang it in Wood^-fr^oke, 
wherethere is but little fire, and a condant fmoke, for a month ; 
then take it down^ and hang it in a dry place, not hot, and keep 
it for ufe. You may cut a piece off as you have occafion, and 
thher boil ft or cut it In rafiiers, and broit it with poached eggs, 
or boil a piece, and it eats fine cojd, and will ihiver tike DutcN 
beef. After this beef i$ done> you may do a thick brifcuit of 
beef in the fame pickle. Let it lie a month, rubbing it evefy day 
with the piekle, then boit it tilt it is tender, hang it in a dry 
place, and it eats finely cold, cut in flices on a plate. It is a 
pretty thing for a fide-dlfti, of for fapper. A Ihoulder of mut- 
ton laid in this pickle for a week, hung in wood fmoke two or 
thr^e days^ and then boiled with cabbage^ is very good.

To make mutton bams. 

YOU muft take a hind-quarter of mutton, cat it like a haiHt 
take one ounce of falc-petre, a pound of coarie fugar, a pound 
. of common fait ; mix them and rub your ham,' lay it in a hollow 
tray with the (kin downwards, bafte it every day for a fortnight* 
then roll it in faw-duft, and hang it in the wood-'fmokc, a fort- 
night \ then boil it, and hatig it in a dry place, and cut it out 
In ra(bers. It don't eat well boiled, but eatd finely broiled. 

To make pork hams. 

YOU muft take a fat hind-quarter of pork, and cut o(Fa fine 
ham. Take an ounce of falt-petre^ a pound of coarfe fugar, 
and a pound of common fait; mix all together, and rub it well. 
Let it lie a month in this pickle, turning andbiifting it every 
day, then hang it in wood fmoke as you do- beef, id a dry 
place, fo as.noheat comes to it; and if you keep them long, hang 
them a month or two in a damp place, fo as they will be mouldy^ 
and it will make them cut fine and (bort. Never lay thefe hams 
in water till you boil them,, and then boil them in accpper, if 
you have one, or the biggeft pot you have. Put them in- the 
cold water, and let them be four or five hours before they boil. 
Skim the pot well and often, till it boils. If it is a very large 
one, ^wo hours will boil it ; if a fmall one, an hour and a half 
will do, provided it be a great while .before the water boils. 
Take it up half an hour before dinner, pull ofi^ the fkin, and 
throw rafpings finely fifted all over. Hold .a red-hot fire fliovel 
over it, and when dinner is ready take a few rafpungs in a fieve 
and fift all over the diHi; then lay in your ham, and with your 
finger make fine figures round the edge of the difii. Be fure 
to boil your ham in as much water as you can, and to keep it 
(kimming all the time till it boils. It Qiuft be at leafl four hours 
before it boils* 

This pickle does finely for tongues, afterwardsj to lie in it a 
fortnight, and thsn hang in the wood-fmoke a fortnight, or to 
boil them out of the pickle. 

York(htre is famous for hams ; and the reafon is this : their 
fait is much finer than ours in London, it is a large clear falt^ 
and gives the meat a fine flavour. I ufed to have it from Mai- 
den in Efiex, and that fait will make any ham as fine as you can 
d^fire. It is by much the beft fait for faltinrg of meat. A deep 
«hollow wooden tray is better than a pan, becauf^ the pickle 
fwells about it« 

I ' When 



made Plain and Eafy. 259 

Wheji you. broil any of thefe hams in flices, or bacon^ hav« 
fome boiling water ready, and let the'flices lie a rninute or two 
inthe water, then broil them ; it takes out the fait, and makes 
thenr eat finer. v . 

To make bacon. 

TAKE a fide of pork> then tak;e off all the infide fat, lay it 
on a long board or dreffer, that the blood may run away, rub it 
Well with good fait on both fides, let it lie thus a week ; then 
take a pi«t of bay fait, a quarter of a pound of falt-pctre, beat 
them fine, two pounds of coarfe fugar, and a quarter of a peck of 
common fait. Lay your pork in fomething that will hold the 
pickle, and rub if well with the above ingredients. Lay the 
flcinny fidedowi.'vards,and bafli: itevery day with the pickle for 
a fortnight; then hang it in wood-fmokeas you do the beef, and 
afterwards hang it in a dry place, but Hot hot. You are toob* 
ferve, that all hariis arid bacon (Hould hang clear from every 
thing, and not againfl a wall. 

Obferve to wipe off all the old fait before you put it into this 
j^Jckle, and never keep bacon or hams in a hot kitchen, or in a 
room where the fun comes. It makes them all rufty.

To fave potted hirdsy that begin to be bad. 

I HAVE feen potted birds which have come a great way, of-, 
t^n fmeli fo bad, that no body could bear the fmell for the raak* 
fitk of the butter, and by managing them in the following man* 
xier, have made them as good as over was eat.

mind, put them, down clofe in a pot, and pour clarified butter 
over tbem. 

To pickle mackrel^ called caveach. 

CUT your mackrel into round pieces, and divide one into 
five or fix pieces : to fix large mackrel you may take one ounce 
of beaten pepper, three large nutmegs, a little mace,and a hand- 
ful of fait. Mix your fait and beaten fpice together, then make

To fickk walnuts blach . 

YOU muft take large full-grown nuts, at their fuH growffh 
faefore they are hard, lay them iii fait and water; let tnem He 
two days, then (hift them into fre(h water; let them lie two days 
longer, then {hift them again, and let them lie three days^ then 
take them out of the water, and put them into your pickling- 
pot. When the pot is half full, put in a large onion ftuck wiih 
, cloves. To a hundred of walnuts put in half a pint of muftard- 
feed, a quarter of an ounce of mace, half an ounce of black 
pepper, half an ounce of all.-fpice^ fix bay-leaves, and a ftick 
of horfe-raddifh ; then fill your pot, and pour boiling vinegar 
over them. Cover them with a plate, and when they are cold 
tie them down with a bladder and leather, and they wijl be fie 
to eat in two or three months. The next year, if any remains^ 
boil up your vinegar figain, and (kirn it ; when cold, pour it o\'er 
your walnuts. Thi$ is by much the beft pickle for ufe ; there- 
fore you may add more vinegar to it, what quantity you pleafe. 
If you pickle a greatmany walnuts, and eat them fatt,make your 
pickle for a hundred or two, the reft keep in a ftrong brine of 
iait and water, boiled till it will bear an egg, and as your pot 
fempties^ fill them up with thofe in the fait and water^ Take

them out of thepor, wipe it clean, and jiift rub the outs with 
a coarfe cloth, apd then put them in the jarwit^i thie pickle, as

you need not boll it the £ri1: year, but pour it on eold ; and the 
next year, if any remains, boil it up again, fkim it, put freih 
fpice toic, and it will do again. 

To pickle gerkins. 

TAKE what quantity of cucumbers you think fit, and put

with a woollen cloth, and over that a pewicr d ifh ; tie them down 
cIofe,and l6t them (land twenty.four hours ; then take them out, 
lay them in a cloth, and another over them to dry them. When 
they are pretty dry, wipe your jar out with a dry cloth, put your 
cucumbers, and with them a liirtle dill and fennel, a very fmall 
quantity. For the pickle, to every three quaris of vinegar one 
quart of fpring-w^ater, till you think you have enough to cover 
them; put in a little bay-falt and a little while, but not too 
much/ To every gallon of pickle put one nutmeg cut in quar- 
ters, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, a quarter of an ounce of 
xnace, a quarter of an ounce of whole pepper, and a large race of 
ginger fliced ; boil all thefe together in a bell-metal or copper- 
pot, pour it boiling hot on your cucumbers, and cover them as 
before. Let them lh>nd two days, then boil your pickle again, 
and pour it on as before ; do fo a third time \ when they are 
cold cover them with a bladder and then a leather. ' Mind al- 
ivays to keep your pickles clofe covered, and never take them 
out with any thing but a wooden fpoon, or one for the purpofe. 
This pickle will do the next year«. only boiling it up again. 

You are to obferve to put the fpice in the jar with the cucum- 
bers, and only boil the vinegar, water, and fait, and pour over 
them. The boiling of your fpice in all pickles fpoils them, and 
loles the fine flavour of the fpice.

7t9 make iircb wine, 

THE feafon for procuring the liquor from die birch tfces is 
in the beginning of March, while the Cap is rifing, andbeforethe 
Jeaves (hoot out; for when the fap is come forward, and the 
leaves appear, the juice, by being long dtgefted in the bark, 
^rows thick and coloured, which before was thin and clear. 

The method of procuring the juice is, by boring holes in the 
body of the tree, and putting in foffets, which are commonly 
made of the branches of elder, the pith being taken out. You 
may without hurting the tree, if large, tap it in feveral places, 
four or five at a time, and by that means fave from a good many 
trees feveral gallons every day ; if you have not enough in one 
day, the bottles in which it drops muft be cork'd clofe, and 10- 
fined or waxed ; however, make ufe of it as foon as you can. 

Ti^e the fap and boil it as Jong as any fcum rifes, flcimming 
it all the timfe : to every gallon of liquor put four pounds of good 
fugar, the thin peelof a lemon, boil it afterwards half an hour, 
Ikimming it very well, pour it into a clean tub, and when it is 
almoft-cold, fet it to work with yeaft fpread upon a to'aft, let 
it ftand five or fix days, ftirring it often ; then takefuch a caflt 
as will hold the Hquor, fire a large match dipt in brimftone, and 
throw It into the cafk, ftop it clc^etill the match isextmguiflied, 
tiin your wine, lay the bung on light till you find it has done 
working; ftop it clofe and keep it three months, then bottle it off. 

To wake quince wir^e. ' 

GATHER the quinces when dry and fijJI ripe; take twenty 
large quinces, wipe them clean with a coarfe cloth, and grate 
f hem with a large grate or rafp as near the core as you can, but 
none of the core; boil a gallon of fpring-water, throw in your 
quinces, let it boil foftly about a quarter of an hour, tbbn ftrain

take out the toafi and lemon, put it up in a caig» keep it three 
n^onths, and then bottle it. If you make a twenty gallon ca(k, 
let it (land fix months before you bottle it ; when you drain 
your quinces, you are to wring them hard in a coarfe cloth.

TAKE fix gallons of water, twelve pounds of fugar, the juice 
of fix lemons, the whites of four eggs beat very well, put all

take a peck of cowfltps ; if dry ones, half a peck ; put them into 
* a tub with the thin peeling of fix lemons, then pour on the 
boiling liquor, and ftir them about; when almoft cold, put in a 
thin toaft baked dry and rubbed with yeaft. Let it ftand two or 
.three days to work: If you put in before you tun it fix ounces 
of fyrup of citron or lemons, with a quart of Rhenifli wine, it 
will be a great addition ; the third day ftrain it off, and fqueeze 
the cowflips through a coarfe cloth, then ftrain it through a 
flannel bag, and turn it up, lay the bung loofe for two or three 
fdays to fee ifit works, and if it don't, biing it down tight; let 
it ftand three months, then bottle it. 

To make turnip mne^ 

TAKE a good many turnips, parethem» dice them, put them 
in a cyder-prefs, and prefsoutall the juice very well. To every 
gallon of juice have three pounds of lump fugar, have a vefl'ei 
ready, juft big enough to hold the juice, put your fugar into a 
^ veiTeU and alfo to every gallon of juice half a pint of brandy. 
Pour in the juice, and lay Something oyer the bung for a week, 
to fee ifit works. Ifit does, you muQ not buAg it down till it 
has done working; then ftopitclofe for threemonihs, and draw 
it oft* into another vefTel. When it is fine, bottle it off. 

To make rafpberty wine* 

TAKE fome fine a rafpberries, bruife rhem with the back of 
a fpoon, then ftraiA them through a flannel bag into a ftone 
jar. To each quart of juice put a pound of double^refined fu- 
gar, ftir it well together, and cover it clofe ; let it ftand three 
days, then pour it off clear. To a quart of juice put two quarts 
of white wine, }>ottle it off; it will be fit to drink in a week. 
Brandy made thus is a very fine dram, and a much better way 
than fteeping the rafpberries.

Rules for brewing. 

CARE muft be taken in the firft place to have the malt clean; 
and after it is ground, it ought to fland four or five days. 

For ftrong Oflober, five quarters of malt to three hogflieads^ 
. and twenty-four pounds of hops*. This will afterwards make 
two hogfheads of good keeping fmall beer, allowing five pounds 
of hops to it. 

For good middling beer, a quarter of malt makes a hogfhead 
of ale, and one of fmall beer; or it will make three hogsheads 
of good fmall beer, allowing eight pounds of hops. This will 
keep all the year. Or it will make twenty gallons of ftrong 
ale, and two hogsheads of fmall beer that will keep all the year. 

If you intend your ale to keep a great while, allow a pound 
of hops to every bufiiel ; if to keep iix months, five pounds to a 
hogihead ; if for prefent drinking, three pounds to a hogfliead, 
and the fofteft and cleareft water you can get. 

Obfcrve the day before to have all your veffels very clean, and 
aever ufe your tubs for any other ufe except to make wines. 

Let your cafks be very clean the day before with boiling, wa- 
ter; and if your bung is big enough, fcrub them well with a 
little birch broom or brufh ; but if they be very bad, take out 
the heads, and let them be fcrubbed clean with a hand-brufh 
and fand and fuUers-earth. Put on the head. again and fcald 
them well, throw into the barrel a piece of unila'cked lime, and 
fiop the bung clofe. 

The firft copper of water, when it boils, pour Into your maOi-

^nd take great care they don't burn, or be too much difcoloured, 
but that you will be a judge of in two or three makings. Take 
care the middle of the iron is not too hot, as it will be, but then 
you may put a brick-bat^or two in the middle of the fire tofiac- 
ken the heat. The thing you bake on muft be made thus : 

Build a place juft as if you was going to fet a copper, and in 
the ftead of a copper, a piece of iron all over the top fixed in form, 
juft the fame as the bottom of an iron por, and make your fire 
underneath with coal as in a copper. Obferve, mui&ns are made 
the fame wayj only this, when you pull them to pieces roll them 
in a good deal of flour, and with a rolling-pin roll them thin, 
cover them with a piece of flannel, and they will rife to a proper 
.thicknefs \ and if you find them too big or too little, you muft 
roll dough accordingly. Thefe muftnoi be the leaft difcoloured.

When you eat them,, toaft -them with at fork crifp on both 
iides, thea with your hand pull them open, and they will be 
like a honeycomb; lay in as much butter as you intend toufe, 
then clap them together again, and fet it by the fire. When 
you think the butter is melted turn them, that both fides may 
be buttered alike, but don't touch them with a knife, cither to 
fpread or cut them open, if you do they will beas heavy as lead, 
only when they are quite buttered and done, you may cut them 
cro/s with a knife. 

Note. Some flour will foak up a quart or three pints morewater 
than other flour \ then you muii add more water, or fliake in

A receipt for making bread without harm by the help of a 

leaven. 

TAKE a lump of dough, ^bout two pounds of your laft 
making, which has been raifed by barm, keep it by you in a 
wooden veflel, and cover it well with flour. This is your lea* 
ven : then the night before you intend to bake, put the fatd 
leaven to a peck of flour, and work them well together with warm 
water. Let it lie in a dry wooden veflTel, well covered with a li- 
nen cloth and a blanket, and keep it in a warm place. This 
dough kept warm will rife again next morning, and jfirill be fuf- 
ficient to mix with two or three buihels of flour, being worked 
up with warm water and a little fait. When it is well worked 
up, and thoroughly mixed with all the flour, let it be well covered 
with the linen and blanket, until you find it rife; then knead it 
well, and work it up into bricks or loaves, making the loaves 
broad, and not fo thick and high as is frequently done, by which, 
means the bread will be better baked. Then bake your bre«d. 

Always keep by you two or more pounds of the dough of 
your lail baking well covered with flour to make leaven to ferve 
from one baking day to another ;• the more leaven is put to 
the flour, the lighter and fpungier the bread will be. The 
frcfher the leaven, the bread will be the lefs four.

fourdofes, one of whichmuftbc taken every morn i;ig failing, 
for four mornings fucceffively, in half a pint of cow's milk 
>varm. After thefe fourdofes arc taken, the patient muft gQ 
into the cold bath, or a cold fpring or liver every morning 
lading fpr a month. He muft be dipt all over, but not to ftay 
h(\yitb his head above water) longer than half a mipute, if the;

AriQtb^rfor the biU of « mad dog. ' . 

FOR the bite of .a mad dog> for eiihet tnan or beaft^ take fix 
Ounces of ru^ cliC!an picked and bruifcd;) four ounces of garliclt 
peeled ^nd brvtifed, four ounces of Venice treacle, and four 
ounces of filed pewter, or fcraped tin. Boil thefe in two quarts 
of the beA ale, in a pan covered clofe over a gentle fire, for the 
fpace of an hour, then drain the ingredients from the liquor. 
0jve eight or nine fpoonfuls of it warm to a man, or a woman, 
three mornings fading* Eight or nine fpoonfuls is fufficlentfor 
theftrongeft; a lefftr quantity to thof<5 younger, or of a weaker 
jconftitution, as you may judge of theii" Arength. Ten or twelve 
fpoonfuls 7or a horfe or a bullocjc^ three, four, or five to a 
iheep, hog, or dog. This muft b(^ given within nine days after 
the bite ; it fel^om fails in maa!or beaft. If you bind fome of 
the ingredients on the wound^H will be fo much the better. 

Receipt ag^njl the plague. 
, TAKE of rue, fag^, mir^t, rofemary, wormwood, and la- 
vender, a handful of each % infufe them together in a gallon 
p{ white wine vinegar^ put the whole into ailohe-pot clofely 
covered up, upon warm wood- a(hes, for four day^ : after whicFt 
draw off (or ftrain through fine fiaiinel) the liquid, and put it 
into bottles well corked ; and into every quart bottle put a quar- 
ter of an ounce of camphire. With this preparation waihyo,ur 
mouth, and rub your loins and your temples every day; fnufFa 
^ittle up your noftrils when you go into the ^ir^ and carry about 
ypu a bit of fpunge dipped in th^ r4me, in order to fmell to upon 
all occi^fions, efpecially when you are near any place or perfon 
that is infeded. They wrice, that four malefadors (^yho had 
robbed the infedted houfes, and murdered the people during the 
<!ourfe of the plague) owned, when they came to the gdtllows^

FIRST t^ke put of your room all lilver and gold lace, \then

cupboard doors, all your drawers and boxes* haog the reft of your 
bedding on the chairbacks» lay the feather-bed qn a table, thea 
iejt. a large broad earthen pan in the middle of the room, and in 
that'fet a chaffing diih that ftandson feet, full of charcoal well 
lighted. If your room is very bad^ a pound of rolled brimftone; 
if only a few, half a pound. Lay it o^ the charcoal, and get 
put of the room as quick as poffibly you can, or it will take 
away'your breath. Shut your dooir clofe, with the blanket over 
it, and be fure to fee it fa as nothing can cgtch fire. If you havid 
any India pepper, throw it in with the brimftone. You muil 
take eare to have the door open whilft you )ay in the brimftone, 
#iat you may get out as loon as poffible. Don -t open the door 
under fix hours, and then you mufl be very careful how you go 
in to open the windows } therefore let the doors ftand open an 
hour before ydu open th^ windows. Then brufli and fweep your 
room very clean, waih it well with boiling lee, or boiling wa- 
ter, with a little unflacked lime in it, get a pint of fpirits of 
wine, apintof fpirits of turpentine, andanbuneeofcamphire; 
fliake all well together, and with a bunch of feathers wa(h your 
bedftead very well, and fpr inkle the reft over the feather-bed, 
and about the wainfcoc and room. ^ 

If you find great fwarms about the ipoin» apd fome not dead, . 
49 this over again ; and you will be quite clear. Every fpring 
2fii, fail, wafli your b^((ead witl^ half apintjai^d you will neveo

bedding and bed^ and you will be clear; but be fure to do it as 
fpon s^s you fii\d one. |f your room is very bad. It will be 
well to pa^ot the room after the brimftone is burnt in it. 

Tbis never fails, if riglitly done. 

An effeSual way to clear the bedftead dfhuggs. 
TAKEquickfilver, and mix it well ina mortar with the white 
of an egg till the quickfilveris all well mixt, andthere is no blub- 
bers ; then beat up fome white of ah egg very fine, and mix with 
the quickfilver till it is like a fine oititment, then with a feather 
^anoint the bedftead all over in every creek and corner, and about 
thelacing and binding, where you think there is any. Do this two 
or three trmes : it isn certain cure, and will not fpoil any thing 

DireSliofis to the boufe-maid. 
ALWAYS when you fweep a room, throw a little wet fand 
all over it, and that will gather up all the flew and duft, pre- 
vent ft from riling, clean the boards, and fave the bedding,

Obfervations on preferving Salt Meat, fo as to 
keep it mellow and fine for three or four' 
Months ; and to preferve potted Butter, 

TAKE care when you Uh your meat In the fummer, that 
it be quiie cool after it comes from the butchers; the way 
15, to lay it oA cold bricks for a few hours, and when you (alt it, 
lay it up on art inclining board, to drain off the blood ; then fait it 
a^frefh, add to every pound of fait half a pound of Lifbon fugar,. 
and turn it in the pickle every day ; at the month's end it will 
be tine: the fait which is commonly ufed, hardens and fpoils all 
the meat; the right fort is that called Los,vnd<;s's fait; it comes 
from Nantwich m Chefliire: there is a very fine fort that comes 
from Maiden in EiTex, and from Suffolk, which is the reafon 
of that butter being finer than any other ; and if every body, 
would make ufe of that fait in potting butter, we Ihould not 
have fo much bad come to market ; obferving all the general 
rules of a dairy. If. you keep your meat long in fair, half the 
quantity of fugar will do; and then beftow loaf fugar, it will 
eat much finer. This pickle cannot be called extravagant, be- 
caufe it will keep a great while; at three or four months end, 
boil it up; if you have no meat in the pickle, fkim it, and when 
^old, only add a little more fait ant} fugar to the next meat you 
put in, and it will be good a twelvemonth longer. 

Take a leg of mutton piece, v^iny or thick flank-piece, with- 
out any bone,' pickled as "above, only add to every pound of 
fait an ounce of fajt-petre ; after being a month or two in the 
pickle, take it out, and lay it in foft watejr a few hours, thenroaft 
it; it eats fine. A leg of mutt >n, or fhoulder of veal^ does the 
fame. It is a very good thing where a market is at a gr^^at dif- 
tance, and a large family obliged to provide a great deal of meat. 

As to the pickling of hams and tongues, you have the receipt in

ble, a little fait, the juice of four lemons, and fome fweec^-herbs 
cut fmall ; flew all thefe together till the meat is very tender, 
which will be in about aahour and an half; andtheahave ready 
the back fbell of a turtle, lined with a paHe of flour and water, 
which you muft firft fet into the oven to 'harden ; then put in 
the ingredients, and fet into the oven to brown the top ; and 
when that is done, fuit your garnifh at the top witb the yolks of 
eggis boiled hard, and force-meat balls. 

N. B. This receipt is for a large head ; if you cannot get the 
fhell of a turtle, a china*foop^diin will do as well ; and if no 
oven is at hand, the fetting may be omitied^ and if no oyfters 
are to be had, it is very good without. 

It has been dreffed with but a pint of wine, apd the juice of 
two lemons. . • 

When the horny part is boiled a little tender, then put in 
your white meat. 

It will do without the oven, and take a fine knuckle of veal, 
c\it off the (kin, and cut fome of the fine firm lean into fmali 
pieces, as you do the white meat of a turtle^ and flew it with 
the other white meat above. 

Take the firm hard fat which grows between the meat, and 
lay that into the fauce of fpinage or forrel, till half an hour be- 
fore the above is ready; then take it out, and lay it on a fieve 
tp drain ;\and put in juice to ftew with the above. The re- 
mainder of the kniickle wil} help the gravy,

ALL the kinds, except ftock-fiOi, are falted, or either dried

by the fmoke of wood*iires in chimney corners ; and in either 
fcafe, require the being fofteped ^nd ffeOiened in proportioa 
to their bulk or bignefs, their nature or drynefs ; the very dry 
fort, as, bacalao, cod -fifli or whiting, and fuch like, (hould be 
fteeped in luke warm milk and water ; the fteeping kept as 
near as poflible to an equal degree of beat. The larger iifli 1
