Baked Beans with Relish 

Bake the beans in a small basin 
with a piece of scored salt pork in 
centre. When cold, cover with waxed 
paper, wrap in strong wrapping-paper 
and place in the bottom of the picnic 
basket. Fill a small jelly jar or large- 
mouthed bottle with equal portions 
of tomato catsup and freshly grated 
horseradish, add, if at hand, 1 tbsp. 
each of finely minced green pepper 
and pimento or sweet red pepper. 
Wrap the glass in a paper and place 
in the basket. A recipe for the beans 
may be found on page 8 in :< One 
Hundred Luncheon Dishes." 



Baked-Bean Roll with 
Sausage 

When baking beans substitute a 

link of sausage for the salt pork. 

When baked pack in a cylinder mould 

-a round baking-powder can will do 

-insert the sausage in the centre, and 

place the mould in the ice-box. Let 

it remain in the mould until serving 

time. Cut it in slices and serve with 

Oscar sauce or home-made chilli sauce. 



Baked-Bean Savory 

Cook, in 2 tbsps. of salt pork or 
bacon fat a large slice of onion, add 
1 teasp. curry -powder and ^ cup of 
tomato pulp, or half the amount of 
tomato catsup. Add 2 or S cups of 
baked beans, turn into a mould, and 
when cold serve on lettuce leaves. 



Bologna Biscuit 

Roll baking-powder biscuit dough 
quite thin, cut in rounds the size of 
a bologna sausage, and place a thin 
slice of the sausage between each two 
rounds. Bake in a quick oven. The 
skin may be removed from the sausage 
and the disks cut to fit the biscuit. 
This, of course, should be done before 
making the biscuit. If liked, a very 
little French or German mustard may 
be spread on each slice of sausage be- 
fore laying them on the biscuit.

Eggs, Delicieuse 

Plunge very fresh eggs in boiling- 
water, cover and keep them just be- 
low the boiling-point for 10 minutes, 
boil 1 minute, place on back of stove, 
and let them stand until water is cool. 
Plunge them in cold water and re- 
move shells. Roll them in diluted egg 
white, well seasoned with salt and pep- 
per and paprika, and then in finely 
minced parsley or chives. Wrap each 
one in waxed paper. To keep the 
yolks in the centre, stand the eggs, 
small end down, in a wire rack for a 
day, and boil them in the rack. 



Eggs, Stuffed 

Cook eggs as in recipe (page 7), re- 
move shells, cut in halves, lengthwise, 
remove yolks, and soften them in 
melted butter. Mix them with any 
of the following: minced ham and 
chicken, pate de foie gras and minced 
truffles and minced sauted mush- 
rooms; or, mix with grated dairy cheese 
mixed with pimento pulp and seasoned 
with salt and paprika or tabasco 
sauce. Fill the whites, rounding them 
up into a mound. Wrap each one 
separately in waxed paper.

Ham Shortcakes 

Roll thin and cut into rounds a rich 
baking-powder crust, spread half of 
them with minced ham moistened with 
melted butter and seasoned with 
minced parsley, onion, and paprika. 
Cover with the remainder of the 
rounds and bake in a hot oven. For 
making the biscuits: sift 2 cups of 
pastry flour with Y^ teasp. salt and 4 
teasps. of baking-powder, chop in 1 
teasp. butter and 1 tbsp. of lard, add 
milk to make a soft dough, mix lightly, 
with the fingers, and roll as directed.

13 



Cottage-Cheese and Peanut

of chilli sauce, add 1 tbsp. melted 
butter, 1 teasp. Worcestershire and 
plenty of paprika. Mustard may also 
be added if liked. Spread on slices of 
buttered white bread, cover with 
watercress and again with the bread, 
trim free from crusts, and wrap in 
waxed paper. 



15 



Cheese and Crab -Meat 
Sandwiches 

Cream ^ cup of butter, add same 
amount of grated cheese and spread on 
white-bread slices, dust well with pa- 
prika and cover with slivers of crab 
meat marinated in French dressing. 
Cover with the buttered bread, trim 
and press together, and wrap in waxed 
paper. Lobster may be used instead 
of the crab meat, and canned lobster 
or crab meat may be used. 



16 



Cheese and Nut Sandwiches 

Cream y% cup of butter, add 1 cup 
of grated American cheese and ^ cup 
of pecan or walnut meats minced fine. 
Dust with salt and paprika and spread

pineapple, cream cheese, and pimento 
puree. Season with salt, cayenne, and

19 



Cheese-Sauce Sandwiches

tbsps. flour, cook until well blended 
but not oily, add 1 cup of rich milk, a 
little salt and pepper, % teasp. each 
of mustard and Worcestershire and 1 
cup of grated cheese. When cheese is 
melted add 1 beaten yolk mixed with 
J4 cup of thick cream. Cool slightly 
and spread on buttered white bread 
slices, cover with chopped hard-boiled 
eggs, dust with paprika, and cover 
with another slice of the bread. Trim, 
press together, and wrap each one sep- 
arately in waxed paper. 



Chicken Sandwiches 

Mince chicken rather fine and add 
half the amount of minced celery or 
ham or tongue, or use all chicken. 
Add a few pimolas minced fine, and 
moisten well with thick mayonnaise. 
Spread white bread with creamed 
butter, then with the mixture, cover 
with more of the bread, trim, and wrap 
in waxed paper, then in a napkin wet 
in cold water and again in paper. In 
making mayonnaise for sandwiches 
use twice the number of eggs to the 
usual amount of oil. To % cup of oil 
use 2 egg yolks. This makes the 
dressing very stiff, as it should be for 
sandwich filling. 



Chicken-Cream Sandwiches 

Melt slowly 3 tbsps. butter, add 3 
of flour, and when well blended add 1 
cup of thin cream which has been 
steeped an hour in a double boiler with 
a seasoning of onion, parsley, celery, 
and a small piece of mace, and strained. 
Cook until thick, cool and add 1 cup 
of minced chicken, a few finery minced 
pimolas or blanched almonds. Season

waxed paper and put them all together 
in a damp napkin, and wrap in thick 
paper. 



Chicken- Liver Sandwiches 

Slightly brown in butter 2 slices of 
onion, 3 sprigs of parsley, and a strip 
of green pepper. Brown the chicken 
livers in this and cover with chicken 
stock. Simmer slowly until the livers 
are tender. Trim them, cut in small 
pieces, and press them through a 
coarse sieve. Season with salt, pa- 
prika, a very little mustard, and a little 
curry -powder, or a few drops of onion 
juice. Add a few minced pimolas or 
olives, if at hand, and spread between 
slices of buttered brown or entire- 
wheat bread. Wrap in waxed paper. 



Chicken and Nut 
Sandwiches 

Add to minced chicken the same 
amount of minced nuts, moisten with 
cream, season well with salt and pa- 
prika and spread between slices of en- 
tire-wheat bread spread with creamed 
butter, and serve with a salad. 

Salted almonds or pecans may be 
used, also filberts or walnuts. 



Corned-Beet Sandwiches 

Mince boiled corned beef, moisten 
with tomato catsup, chilli sauce, or 
made mustard, and spread on graham 
or entire-wheat bread slices well cov- 
ered with creamed butter. Creaming 
the butter is better than melting it, as 
it spreads easier. Wrap the sand- 
wiches in waxed paper. 



Crab -Meat and Pimento 
Sandwiches 

To flake canned or fresh crab meat 
or lobster, add one-fourth the amount 
of pimento puree (pimento or sweet 
red peppers pressed through a sieve).

buttered white-bread slices. Paprika 
and mustard may be added to suit 
taste. Wrap in waxed paper.

onion, 1 green pepper, and 2 tbsps. of 
parsley, all minced fine, boil until ten- 
der, drain and mash, and add to the 
mashed yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs. 
Soften with creamed butter, add a 
very little tarragon vinegar, and 
spread on thin slices of white bread. 
Cover with very thin slices of cu- 
cumber which have laid in French 
dressing an hour or more, cover with 
the bread, and wrap in waxed paper. 



Ham Sandwiches Tartare 

Add to J/ cup of mayonnaise or 
boiled dressing 1 tbsp. of tarragon 
vinegar, % teasp. mustard and 1 tbsp. 
each of minced parsley, capers, gher- 
kins, olives, and chives or onion, and 
2 tbsps. of chopped fresh tomato, 
squeezed dry. Add finely minced 
ham and spread on buttered bread. 
Cover with nasturtium blossoms or 
watercress, cover with the bread, and 
wrap in waxed paper. 



Green-Pepper Sandwiches 

Broil or saute in butter green pep- 
pers cut in strips and scraped free of 
membranes and seeds, dust with salt 
and spread them well with butter, and 
lay the peppers, while hot, between 
slices of buttered white bread. When 
cold wrap them in waxed paper and 
serve with cold meat. 



30 



Green and Red Pepper 
Sandwiches 

Cream ^ cup of butter, add 1 finely

cover with a slice of entire-wheat 
bread, also buttered, spread on this a 
layer of chopped hard-boiled eggs 
mixed with minced pickle and capers, 
and a little anchovy or bloater paste, 
cover with another slice of white 
bread, wrap in cloth, and press under 
a weight for an hour. Trim free of 
crusts and cut through the three layers 
of bread in thin slices. This may be 
taken to the picnic before cutting. 



Liver Sandwiches 

Boil calf's liver until tender, or well- 
cooked sauted liver may be used. 
Trim well and mince fine. Add a 
third of the amount of hard-boiled 
eggs, also chopped fine. Season well 
with salt, pepper, and paprika, and 
soften with creamed butter. Minced 
green peppers and pimentoes or olives 
may be added, if at hand. Spread on 
slices of buttered white bread and 
wrap in waxed paper. 



33 



Peanut-Butter Sandwiches 

Add a few minced olives or pimolas 
to peanut butter, or mashed sardines 
may be used with the peanut butter. 
Sprinkle with lemon juice, dust with 
paprika and spread on slices of but- 
tered white bread, using creamed but- 
ter. Wrap in waxed paper. 



34 



Raisin-Bread Sandwiches 

Use either entire-wheat or white 
bread in which seeded and plumped 
raisins are worked into the dough be- 
fore the last raising. Cut the bread 
as thin as possible (it cannot be cut as 
thin as white bread on account of the 
raisins), spread it with creamed butter, 
dust with finely ground nuts, cover 
with the buttered bread, trim, and 
wrap in waxed paper. This may be 
eaten with salad. 



35 



Roast-Beef or Beefsteak

Cover slices of white bread spread 
with creamed butter, with thin slices 
of cold roast beef or broiled beefsteak 
cut across the grain, spread the beef 
with a layer of horseradish mixed with 
a little chilli sauce, cover with the but- 
tered bread, and trim them free from 
crust. Brown or graham bread may 
be used for the upper slice. The beef 
may be minced, if desired, and grated 
onion with salt, celery salt, and pa- 
prika used instead of the chilli sauce. 



36 



Sardine Sandwiches 

Toast lightly thin slices of well- 
trimmed white bread, when cold 
spread with tartare sauce (see page 
29), cover with skinned and boned sar- 
dines, sprinkle with minced capers or 
watercress, and cover with slices of 
the toast spread with creamed butter. 
Wrap separately in waxed paper, then 
all of them in a wet cloth and in strong 
paper. 



37 



Savory Sandwiches 

Mix equal amounts of minced 
chicken livers and lobsters or shrimps,

Wrap in waxed paper. 



39 



For the Thermos Bottle 



Chocolate, Cold 

Melt 2 squares of grated chocolate 
in y$ cup of water, add y$ cup of sugar 
and 3 cups of water and boil until clear 
and smooth, and strain. When cold 
add 1 teasp. of vanilla or sherry, or 
flavor while cooking with a small stick 
of cinnamon. Put on ice until very 
cold, add Y% cup of cream and pour 
into the thermos bottle, or carry the 
cream in a separate bottle. More 
sugar should be taken for those who 
require it. 



43 



Chocolate, Hot 

Melt 3 squares of grated chocolate 
in % cup of hot water, add J^ cup of 
sugar and 3 cups of milk, simmer 5 
minutes, beating as soon as hot with 
a Dover egg beater. Add 1 teasp. of 
vanilla and 1 of sherry and a small 
piece of orange peel. Remove peel 
and when boiling again pour into the 
hot thermos bottle. Serve with a 
spoonful of cream in each cup. The 
cream may be carried in a separate 
bottle, and also more sugar. 



44 



Coffee, Cold 

Put 8 tbsps. of powdered coffee in 
the percolator, pour over 3 cups of cold 
water and cook until the liquid is 
quite brown. Add 1 tbsp. of the pow- 
dered coffee to the top of the perco- 
lator and cook again about a minute. 
Take from the fire, and when nearly 
cold pour into a pitcher containing a 
large piece of ice. When very cold 
pour into the chilled thermos bottle. 
Take a bottle of cream wrapped in a 
napkin wet in ice-water, and wrapped 
again in thick paper. Carry cream 
and powdered sugar separately. 



45 



Coffee, Hot 

Put 6 tbsps. of powdered coffee into 
the percolator, pour over 3 cups of 
cold water and cook 15 minutes, re- 
move from the fire and add 1 tbsp. of 
the powdered coffee and place on the 
fire again for a moment. Or use the 
same proportions of ground coffee, add 
the crushed shell and white of 1 egg to 
the coffee, stir in J^ cup of cold water, 
turn into a very clean pot and add 3 
cups of cold water and heat slowly 
until boiling. Boil this 3 minutes, 
pour in 3 tbsps. of cold water, strain 
into a hot pitcher containing sugar 
and cream, stir a moment and pour 
into the hot thermos bottle, or carry 
the cream and sugar in separate re- 
ceptacles. 

46 



Caffeineless Coffee 

This is genuine coffee from which 
the caffeine has been largely removed, 
and it is particularly adapted for those 
to whom ordinary coffee is forbidden. 
While the directions given by the 
makers are as for ordinary coffee, the 
writer, having used it for many years, 
finds that it is necessary to make it 
somewhat stronger than for ordinary 
coffee. This is excellent, both hot 
and iced, and may be made according 
to the recipes given on the preceding 
pages. 



47 



Egg-Nog 

Mix 2 cups of cream with 1 cup of 
milk which has been beaten with 4 
egg yolks, a scant Y cup of sugar, 2 
tbsps. each of sherry and brandy, and 
a generous grating of nutmeg. Beat 
well and add the egg whites beaten, 
not too stiff. Chill on the ice and 
pour into the chilled thermos bottle. 



Ginger -Ale Punch 

Crush one-half bunch of well- 
washed mint leaves with % cup of 
sugar, add 3 small lemons and 1 or- 
ange cut in slices, J^ cup of crushed 
pineapple, if at hand, and place for a 
few hours on ice. Strain through a 
wet cloth into a pitcher of ice, when 
very cold add 1 pint of ginger ale, also 
well chilled, and pour immediately 
into the ice-cold thermos bottle. 



49 



Grape-Juice Punch 

Mix grape juice with ginger ale and 
White Rock water, using about half 
the amount of water. Pour into a 
pitcher containing cracked ice. When 
very cold add small pieces of canta- 
loupe, grape fruit, or pineapple and 
pour into the well-chilled thermos 
bottle. 



50 



Grape Juice, Hot 

Heat to boiling point in a double 
boiler 1 qt. of grape juice, with a few 
cassia buds, or a 2-inch stick of cin- 
namon, strain and return to fire until 
nearly boiling, and pour into the hot 
thermos bottle. This is a most deli- 
cious drink for a cold day. 



51 



Tea, Cold 

Pour 3 cups of freshly boiling water 
onto 6 teasps. of tea, let stand on the 
fire a moment, stir the contents of the 
pot with a spoon, remove from the fire 
and let stand 3 minutes. Crush 6 
slices of lemon and a few leaves of mint 
with 4 tbsps. of powdered sugar in a 
pitcher, add cracked ice and pour in 
the hot tea. When cold strain into 
the chilled thermos bottle. 



Tea Mate, Cold 

This is a delicious aromatic tea, 
which is made from the leaves of a 
kind of prickly holly which grows in 
Brazil. According to recent authori- 
ties, it accelerates the circulation of the 
blood, diminishes fatigue, and is much 
less exciting to the nervous system 
than ordinary tea. To make it, add 
to 3 cups of cold water 6 teasps. of 
Mate, stir well and place on the fire 
until the water boils. Stir again and 
remove from the fire. Let stand 3 
minutes and strain into a pitcher con- 
taining 6 slices of lemon, crushed with 
a few sprigs of mint and 4 tbsps. pow- 
dered sugar, and plenty of cracked ice. 
When cold strain into the chilled 
thermos bottle. 

53

Beef Galantine 

Mince cold roast or boiled beef 
rather fine. Season with 1 teasp. of 
grated onion, 1 of minced parsley, salt, 
pepper, and paprika, and add a peeled 
tomato chopped rather fine. Add 1 
tbsp. of gelatine soaked in % cup of 
cold water and melted in J/ cup of 
beef stock, turn into a mould and stir 
until it begins to harden, then place 
on ice until it is set. This may be put 
in round baking-powder cans or in a 
small pan. Tomato catsup or chilli 
sauce may be used in the place of the 
fresh tomato if desired. Wrap in 
cloth wet in cold water, and then in 
thick paper. 



57 



Beefsteak and Ham Pie 

Line a shallow baking dish or tin 
basin with a thin layer of minced ham, 
mixed with half the amount of tomato 
sauce, highly seasoned. Add thin 
strips of cold broiled beefsteak, minced 
parsley and a few chopped fresh mush- 
rooms, if at hand, and put an inverted 
custard cup in the centre, or make a 
hole in the crust and insert a funnel of 
thick, buttered paper. Cover with a 
rich baking-powder biscuit crust, prick 
it with a fork, brush over with slightly 
beaten egg white mixed with milk, and 
bake. When done remove funnel and 
pour in a cup of strong stock, to which 
1 tbsp. of softened gelatine has been 
added. 



58

tabasco and mustard, or with a very 
little nutmeg, and 2 or 3 tbsps. of Ma- 
deira wine. Turn into a very hot 
vacuum jar, cork well, and place in the 
motor hamper. These thermos va- 
cuum jars are made purposely for hot 
mixtures, as they are cylinder shape 
with a cork the same size of the jar. 
The cream sauce is 2 tbsps. of butter, 
2 of flour, 1 cup of cream, and salt and 
pepper.

and when cold roll each piece in waxed 
paper and pack in a tin or pasteboard 
box. 



61 



Chicken Galantine 

Boil a fowl, remove skin, and cut the 
meat into thin slivers. Cool, remove 
fat, and boil the stock until well-re- 
duced, with a seasoning of onion, pars- 
ley, and celery seed. Strain and add 
to 2 cups of this stock 1 tbsp. of gela- 
tine softened in J^ cup of cold water. 
Pour a little of this stock when slightly 
cool into a bread pan ; when nearly set
