NOTE. 



It was not the aim of the compilers of this book to 
furnish a complete guide to housekeeping, but to collect 
such rich, rare and racy, as well as time-honored, recipes 
as have never been given to the public. To these we 
have added some from well-known books because of 
their great excellence. 

Fully aware that by adding the recipe to be found on 
the last page of the book we have laid ourselves open to 
the charge of inconsistency, we have done so because 
we believe that the prophet should not be without honor 
in her own country. 

Our thanks are due to the friends who so cordially 
responded to our request for the " choicest recipe." 

Kindergarten Committee.

German Method of Preparing Spring Chicken. 

Carefully dress and singe the chicken; mix salt and 
pepper, and rub thoroughly all over the inside; peel a 
small onion and lay with half a teaspoonful of thyme 
inside the chicken; spread a sheet of writing paper 
thickly with butter and tie around the chicken, care- 
fully covering all the incisions; put into a dripping pan 
with enough hot water to more than cover the bottom; 
put one or two small onions into the pan, with two 
cloves stuck into each. Half an hour before removing 
from the oven, place a small piece of toasted bread in 
the pan. Remove the paper. Serve the gravy in a

175 <^"H()ICE RECIPES. ^9 

1 small onion. 

Juice of I large lemon. 

2 tablespoonfuls of desiccated cocoanut. 
I cup of milk. 

Salt to taste. 

Put the cocoanut to soak in the cup of milk; make a 
paste of the curry by mixing it with a little cold water; 
slice the onion thinly and put it in about half the butter 
into a pan on the fire; cook till well browned; add the 
rest of the butter and put in the curr}- paste. Fry from 
5 to 8 minutes, stirring all the time. When quite dry 
put on the back of the stove, adding a cup of hot water. 
Now add the meat cut in small pieces; cook the whole 
for about an hour, preventing its getting dry by adding 
hot water occasionally, or, better still, broth or gravy. 
Twenty minutes before serving add the juice of the 
lemon, and before removing from the fire add the des- 
iccated cocoanut and milk, with salt. 

This dish is not good unless the rice is cooked dry 
and each grain separate. 

HOW TO BOIL RICE WELL. 

Take the largest porcelain-lined kettle you have, fill 
with water, and let it boil. When it is boiling hard 
throw in the washed rice. Boil fast for about 20 
minutes, stirring occasionally to keep from burning. 
Add salt. Try the rice by biting it, and the moment it 
is soft, remove from fire and pour off the water. Put 
the rice in a colander and let it drain till quite dry. 
Serve in separate dishes the rice and the curry, and in 
helping put rice first on each plate, then the curry 
on top.

Moisten slices or bits of bread with milk or water,

For every can of shrimps use the yelks of two eggsÂ» 



175 CIIOKK Rl'XMl'F-S. 11 

The eggs should be fresh and cokl, and the oil of the 
best quality and cold. Put the yelks of the eggs on a 
dinner plate, stir them round and round a minute or so 
with a silver fork, then begin adding the oil, a few drops 
at a time, stirring steadily. As the eggs and oil begin 
to thicken, the oil can be added a little more at a time; 
but the more slowly it is put in the less likely are the 
eggs and oil to separate. When it becomes very stiff, 
a little vinecrar can be added and stirred in slowlv until 
the dressing resembles boiled custard. Much or little 
oil can be used, but a coffee cup of the mayonnaise is 
not too much for an ordinary dish of salad. Those 
who like oil would use 2 cups. Mix a little of the 
dressing with the salad; pile it lightly on a flat dish or 
in a salad bowl, and pour the dressing evenly over it. 
The salad can be trimmed wdth the delicate tops of the 
celery for a border and ornamented with olives, capers,^ 
rings of hard-boiled eggs and thin slices of red beets 
cut in diamonds or stars. The same mayonnaise can be 
used for chicken or lobster salad; but for lobster omit 
the celery dressing, using lettuce leaves fresh and crisp. 
Serve a few of these with each plate of salad.

" I have formed a settled conviction that the world 
is fed too much. Pastries, cakes, hot bread, rich gra- 
vies, pickles, pepper sauces, salads, tea and coffee are 
discarded from my ' bill of fare,' and I firmly believe 
that they will be from the recipes of the twentieth cent- 
ury. Entire wheat flour bread, vegetables, fruit, fish 
with a little meat, and milk as the chief drink, will dis- 
till in the alembic of the digestive organs into pure, 
rich, feverless blood, electric but steady nerves, and 
brains that can ' think God's thoughts after Him ' as 
they have never yet been thought. This is my recipe : 
'â Plain living and high thinking^ and this is my warn- 
ing: With high living yoti will get exceedingly plain 
thinking. Yours for stomachic rights,
