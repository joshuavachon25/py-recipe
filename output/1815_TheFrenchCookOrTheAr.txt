PREFACE. 



I ' 



Soon after my arrival in this country, 1 thought 
^f publishing a work, which might prove of 
|;reat utility to sUch, amongst others^ as 
kithough possessed of real knowledge, yet might 
not uafrequently be at a loss, from mere 
ivant of memory. The works hitherto pub- 
lished on the Art of Cookery are unintel- 
ligible^ and the receipts tbereia indicated im* 
pi^cticable. 

Martialo, an Italian by birth, as nlay be kndwtl 
ftt once by his name^ was a famous Cook in his 
time : but were he to make his appearance noiv^ 
he would cut a very pooi; figure. His book dis- 
plays nothing besides costly dishes, bad pre- 
cepts, and worse taste. Several works hate 
appeared since under various denominations; 
but seldom from the^ peii of professional Cook^* 
The Art of Cookery is a science appreciated 
only by very few individuals; and which re- 
quires, besides a great deal of studious applica- 
tion, no small share of intellect, and the strictest 



a 



u 



sobriety and punctuality^ to be brought to per- 
fection. In England^ the few assistants that a 
head Cook is allowed in a family, and the num- 
ber of dishes lie has to prepare, often deprive 
him of an opportunity of displaying his abilities ; 
nay, after ten years of the utmost 'exertion to 
bring his Art to perfection, he ranks no higher 
than an humble domestic. , 

If I should be so fortunate as to succeed in 
iny attempt, I hope to produce a more easy 
method than has hitherto been pointed out. 
I shall first treat of houillonSj cpnsomm^iy sauces, 
&c. which are the basis of Cookery. Next, 
beginning with beef^ as the most common^ 
vet the most indispeiisible article for the 
corps de bouillons, I shall explain all the difle- 
rent purposes that beef will answer ; for re- 
levdsy entr^s, terrifies : I shall then proceed 

m 

to treat of veal ; and subsequently of every 

bther kind of materials.

- When I shall have explained the inantier of 
dressing the entries, retevds, &c. I shall refer 
for the proper saace to the chapter of sauces^ 
wherein they will all, or nearly all be explained^ 
ptinuant to the method practised in Paris, or at 
Versailles, in tlie kitchens of the Royal Family. 
I intend^ moreover, to indicate the. manner of 
making them, which I have contrived since I 
bafve been in England, from which I have derived 
i|9tp^itf<m, economy, and I mayToiake bold to 
affirm, great improvement in point of savour. 
• Thi» work, notwithstanding the utility it 
might be of in Paris, is more particularly in- 
tended for Engknd. I shall introduce not only 
Mdi apple-sauce, bread-sauce, &c. sauces lor fish 

a 3 



IV 

as are not known in France^ but also the manner 
of dressing fish en maigrep for those persons w^io 
are Roman Catholics. 

Those vegetables that are used as garnish tQ 
the enfr^eSf and relevds, will be found among 
the sauces; and those that are intended for 
entremets in their proper place, when mention 
will be made of the proper time of the year to 
send them up to table. 

The entremets sticrds such as Suidoise^ Char^ 
lottCy pommes au ris, chartreuse de fruity pan-- 
nequety beignets^ souffl^s^ poudings, mirotons de 
pommes^ croquettes de risy croquettes de pomme 
de terre, &c. &c. &c. and in general what is not 
the department of the pastry-cook, will be men- 
tioned in the chapter of entremets sucrds^ toge* 
ther with the creams. 

The jellies for both summer and winter, will 
be treated of in a particular chapter. 

Pastry will be treated of under a distinct head ; 
so that such persons as should have a grand 
dinner to serve up every day, would seldom 
send up to table the same articles by following 
the method which I shall prescribe. 

Suppose tliere are eight persons at dinner. 
You cannot send up less than four entriesj a 
soup, and a fish. Now as a remove to the 
two latter, you must have two removes, tnz. 



two dishes of rdt. Next four entremets, and 
if you should think proper two removes of 
rdt. You make your bill of fare, chusing 
out of each chapter whatever you may want, 
namely, a soup, a fish, two removes, four 
entries ; by which must be understood- one arti- 
cle out of the chapter that relates to ^^ mut- 
ton or lamb ; " one out of the article ^' veal,'* 
two at that of ** poulets gras^ with this pro- 
viso, however, that no two entries are to be 
alike either in shape, colour, or taste. 

For the second course you must act upon the 
same principle. 

The rdts will be found in the chapter of 
ritSy and according to the particular season of 
the year : neither must they bear any resem- ' 
blance with each other. W ith regard to the 
entremets, in summer time you will select two 
amongst the vegetables, one amongst the jellies 
and the other out of the chapter pdtmerle 
(pastry), as for instance :

From the above statement it will be easy to

sixteen entries, and the other courses in propor- 
tion. For the convenience of those persons who 
wish to have a bill of fare presented to them ac« 
cording to the English way^ I shall introduce 
some of from four to sixteen ditches ; observing^ 
in the mean time, that whenever tliere are more 
than four efUr^eSy symqsetry must always be at« 
tended to. The two flanks, for a dinner of 
six entries must be parallel, that is to say^ 
that if you place petits pdtds on one side, 
you must have croquettes on the other ; if 
you have a vol au vent on one side, you must 
place a pdt4 chaud opposite, and so on ; a judi* 
cious arrangement of dishes giving additional 
merit to a dinner. 

The second course requires also a different ar- 
rangement when you have more than four enir^eSn 

a 4

YUl 

At the two flanks you must have two dishes of 
vegetables, if approved of^ and at the fbar coro- 
ners a jelly, some pastry, a lobster, or sallad, 
&c. &c. If direct^ otherwise, you may put 
two sucrds between the two flanks, two dishes of 
vegetables, one at each opposite corner^ shrimps 
and a sallad at each other corner.

I have not brought forward four potages ia 
the above bill of fare; because the choice of 
articles rests with the cook himself, who may 
serve up a good dinner without adhering td the 
very same dishes I have selected, or rather men- 
tioned, as it were at random, in the said bill 
of fare^ or any other under-mentioned* Yet I 
think it would be useless to go beyond sixteen 
entries; for the miiltipHcity of dishes may easily 
be made out. I shall only observe that with 
twenty entries the counter-flanks must exhibit 
copious entries ; and that for the second course^ 
must be introduced what we call moyens d'en* 
tremets, such as brioches^, gdteaux de compiegne, 
babas, and two articles erected according to th^ 
fancy of the pastry-cook. Eight large pieces 
are not requisite when there are only twenty 
entries ; but if you have to send up four and 
twenty, and of course thirty-two entrSes, those 
huge pieces then are indispensible. Whenever 
a dinner consists of more than eight entrdesy it 
Ts impossible for any cook^ to dress them without

I have not mendoned the 'second course for 
the above dinner ; as it is known thai there are 
to be the same nomber of dishes^ as in the 
Antooorse. There must also be two phts de 
rSt at the extremilies^ two on the flanks^ and the 
fetHsrdts aft the counter ftanka. If you Imhtc 
asfistants enough to make some pihces montiee, 
they are to be placed on the counter-flanks. 

I haire added two pdt4sfroidsy whiefa are like* 
wise served at grand dinners. I like them to be 
lent t^ to table with the first trourse, and Ibeve 
to remain during the second. Numbers of peo* 
pie like these pdt4s frmd»i but. if they were 
not served up with the first course, their appe-* 
tite being gone, they coukl not eat of tbeai« 
They are not at all in the way> but improve the 
look of the table. 

N.B. — ^Tbe pdt4$ may be either of game 
•r fowl. 

. in France, between the dormant (ceotre alar 
tionary dish) and the entries^ it is customary 
to place hors-d'oeuvres 9 viz. sallads of ancho- 
vies, canapds, sallad dishes filled with lemons, 
bitter oranges, butter, radishes, turnip radishes, 
of figs in autumn, what we call hors-d* qeuvres de 
cmsine, such as saucisseSj houdins, &c. &c. which 
indeed give a good appearance to a table. In 
England it is not customary to serve hors- 
d'csuvres, as in very few houses,' they keep a 



»• 



xn 

confectioner^ and that the hors-tTnemres belong 
to his department* 

Military tactics, fortification, music, dancings 
and millinery, &c. being of foteign extraction^ 
most of the words relative to the said arts or 
sciences have necessarily retained their original 
appellation. It must not be wondered at^ there- 
fore, if in this work I have made use of the 
original^ or native expressions* The name of 
the various dishes is a matter of course, which 
requires no more explanation, than roast beef^ 
tut plum puddings wehh-rahbity or muffins^ &c* 
do in France. Marquer, masquer, sauter, &c« 
&c. have a particular meaning, but are such 
technical words as cannot be translated properly^ 
for which reason they will frequently be met 
with. Suffice it to say that, Marquer signifies 
to put in a stew*pan or saut4 pan, whichever you 
use. Sauter, is when you put the saut^ pan on 
the stove with the contents. Masqud, is whea 
you are to put the sauce over the; meat, &c«

necessary to practise it as a chief professor. There- 
are very few good cooks, though there is a great 
number who caU themselves so. This dispropor^^ 
tion of talent among them is the cause of the 
little respect in which they are held ; for if they* 
were all provided with the qualities necessary, 
they would certainly be considered as artists* 

What science demands more study than 
oooking? You have not only, as other arts rc« 
quire, to satisfy the eyes ; but by how many^ 
means are you bound to satisfy* the persons who 
employ you ? The economy which every one 
demands; the different taste of persons at the 
same table ; the difficulty of procuring things 
which are necessary ; the want of unanimity 
among the servants of the house ; the unlimited 
confidence sometimes given to persons who are not 
papable of giving orders in the kitchen, without 
giving themselves airs, which are almost always 
out of reason, and which often discourage the 
cook. In fact, a thousand observations, too 
tedious to detail, render this employment very 
laborious and little honored. Nevertheless, if 
you are extremely clean, if you are very sober;

"and have^ above all, a great deal of activity^ you 
succeed one day or other in acquiring that confi-*- 
d^noe^ which these qualities always inspire. You 
liave not the power, as others have, to put off till 
another day ; the work must be done at the ap- 
pointed time : be careful then, to have every thing 
ready for your work always by the time it is re* 
quired, and, above all, without noise or confusion. 

Although you ought not to be regarded merely 
as a servant, you have still a duty to fulfil ; you 
are obliged to serve at the precise hour, to anti- 
cipate all that can give pleasure to your employer, 
to have evety thing ready which he has forgot 
to order, to watch strictly over those in your 
department 

If you confide any thing to persons under your 
controj, be careful always to have it done under 
your eye, that you may be able to answer for 
the fault if there be any. It often happens that 
the company who dine together have not the 
same taste ; try as much as possible to furnish 
them with what they like, and above all, make 
no objections to change any dish which is not 
approved of. Were you even the best cook in the 
yyorld, if you arc obstinate in your old routine, 
without seeking to please those who employ you, 
you will merely exist without acquiring either re- 
putation or fortune. Great cleanlim^ss is requisite 
in the utensils you employ : you ought never to

little white sauce or brown ; for economy i^ 
more necessary than ever, seeing the dearness 
of every thing used . in the kitchen. You 
should have great care to take off the fat 
and skim your soups and sauces infinitely. 
The smallest bit of grease is insufferable, it 
indicates bad cookery and a cook without me- 
thod. The " cuissons^ the '* braizes^ the 
*^ broiling^ are things which require the great- 
est attention. The theory of the kitchen is 
trifling, but its practice is extensive. Many 
persons talk of it and yet know nothing about* 
it: for instance, '^ V Almanac des Gounnans^ 
and '^ La Gastronomies a poem on the 
subject of cookery, without treating of it ; 
works only fit for the chaplain^s servant, and 
containing nothing that can give you an idea of 
the science in its perfection. 

I'here exists in France a mode of instructing 
cooks \Vhich cannot be practised here in En- 
gland. For example, in the houses of the Royal 
Family of France there were different depart- 
ments : the ** soups,'* the " sauces,*' the " e«- 
tr^,^ the " cuissons^ the " broilings,'* the 
** entremets^ the pastry, the roasts, the larder, 
&c. &c. for each of these departments there 
<^ere cooks and assistants, who passed alter- 
nately to each of these different branches; ex- 
cept the roasls and pastry, which were constantly 
under the direction of tbe same persons. 



^ r 



li 

As each person passed every week in his 
turn in these different branches^ each person 
could not fail learning the principles of cookery. 
Nevertheless there are persons who were very 
clever in one department who were horribly 
Stupid in another. Sauces were not confided 
but to experienced persons, as they are the 
most difficult 'parts of cookery ; but when t 
worked upon extraordinary occasions in the 
royal kitchen, I passed through every depart- 
ment/ so that, I flatter myself, I know the 
science of cookery from principle. One diffi- 
culty in cooking is the nanie of the *' entries^ 
the " entremets^ &c. Cooks seldom agree upon 
this point. Some names owe their origin 
either to the cook who invented them, or the 
first epicure who gave them a reputation. I 
<!onfess there are some ridiculous names ; for 
mstance, ** soupe au clair de luue^ " ioupe h ta 
jambe de bois^ ** la poularde en has de soie^ 
and many other names still more ridiculous, which 
I shall certainly not mention in my treatise. 
Her Majesty's soup,** " puddings h la Richelieu^ 
a fowl h la Villeroy^ " sweetbreads h la Dati^ 
pfnne^ &,c. &c. are names which are fluent and 
sonorous. BSckamelle owes its name to a rich 
financier who was a great epicure. I am sur- 
prised not to find in cookery the names of those 
who have given a celebrity to science^ such as 






lii 

Apicitts, Lucullusj, Oetavios^ and those who pa* 
tronized it under the reign of Louis the XI Vth« 
Voltaire says b his '' Mondain^ ^^ that a cools^ 
is a divine mortaL" Why should we not gl<v 
riQr ourselves in our knowledge of cookery? 
It is the soul of our pleasures in all times, in all 
ages. How many marriages have been the eoa-^ 
aequepce of a nueeting at dinner? how mucti 
good fortune has been the result of a s«pper ?. 
At what period of life are we happier thaa at 
table r There hatred is lulled to sleep and 
pleasure reigns. It is at; table that an amiably 
lady or gentleman shines in sallies of wit» wh^re 
they shew the ease with which they perform thik 
honors oi: the table. Here the cook, by hit. 
skill and attentiojriy anticipates their wishes ia 
the happiest selection of well dressed dif^he^r 
Here their wants are satisfied, their minds anct 
bodies invigorated, and themselves are qualified 
for the high delights of love^ music, poetry* 
dancing, and other pleasures. And is he^ whose 
talents has produced these happy efiects, ta 
rank no higher in the scale of man than a G/m^ 
mon servant ? Yes, my friends, adopt the rulea 
I have laid down, and by these attentioQt 
the self-love of mankind will consent at laat^ thiit 
Cookery shall rank in the class of the scienceSp^ 
and its professors deserve the name of ArtkUf^.

FRENCH COOK. 



CHAPTER 1. 

SAUC£S^ ^ROTHS^ AND COKSOMMis. 



19? l.^Le Grand Bouilbn. 

X A R E part of a breast or of a rump of beef, 
with some of the parures. Put the meat into a 
marmite with cold water. Set it on the fire, and 
watch the proper mei^eat to skim it well. If 
this broth is not clear and bright, the other 
broths and sauces will also be spoilt. Be particular 
in skimming off the black scum ; pour a little 
cold water into the above to raise up the white 
scum. When all the scum has been skimmed 
ofi^ put in a few carrots, turnips, heads of celerjr^ 
and leeks, four large onions, one of which is to 
be stuck with cloves ; then throw a handful of 



idXt into the mArmiie, and let the whole simmer' 
for five hours. Drain the broth through a ctoth, 
or a double silk sieve. Lay the piece of beef in 
some liquor of braize, if you have any, to im- 
prove its savour. This grand bouillon serves to 
mouiller (moisten) all other broths^ which ar^ 
termed marmites. 

)9? a.^^Grand Consommi. 

Mark in a marmite a large piece of small 
round of beef^ with a knuckle of veal^ and the 
other bones of the 1^, according to the quantity 
of sauce you may want to make. Put likewise 
the parures of a neck of veal. This marmite 
will admit all manner of veal or poultry. Let 
the meat sweat over a gentle fire. MouiUez with 
about two large ladles full of grand bouilbm % 
put no other vegetables in this marmite^ except 
a bunch of parsley and green onions. Let them 
sweat thoroughly ; then thrust your knife into 
the meat ; if no blood issues it is a sign that it is 
heated through. Then moisten it with boiling 
grand bauillon, and let it boil for about four 
hours. You use this consomm4 to mark the 
sauces^ or the consommds of either poultry or 
game. Skim oflT the grease and scum of all the 
various marmteSy and keep them full> in order 
that the broth should not be too high in celour. 



N? 3i — ConsommS of PouUrjf. 
Beef is no longer required in consommes either 
of poultry or of game. Put a few slices of haixi 
in the bottom of a marmite or of any other 
vessel, likewise some slices of veal. In France 
i^e generally take the sous noix and the omtre 
noix. Lay over the veal the loins of fowl and 
some pdrures. Then mauiUez about two inches 
deep with grand consommS, and let it sweat on 
a fire so confined that the blaze may not colour 
the circumference of the vessel. When the 
meat is heated through^ cover the meat with 
consamm^; season it with mushrooms, a bunch 
of parsley and green onions^ and let the meat 
boil^ till it be done properly. The broths are 
more savoury and mellow when the meat is not 
overdone. Drain the consommi through a silk 
sieve, to use it when wanted. 

N? Ak — Comommd of Game* 

If you are to send up entries of partridges, 
you must have prepared a consofnmi of par- 
tridges. Mark in a stew-pan a few slices of veal^ 
the backs, &c. of partridges to be laid over. If 
yott mouUlez with a consommi containing ham, 
there is no occasion to put in any more j if not, 
a few slices of ham will not be amiss. If your 
^entries arc aiu? truffeSy add the parures of your 

B 2 



truffles and a few mushrooms. When your cm* 
sommi is sufficiently done^ drain it through a 
cloth^ or silk sieve, and use it when you have 
an opportunity. 

N? i.^Consommi of Rabbits. 

* 

Mari^ the various consomnUs with the bonet 
and parures of rabbits. Do the same as for a 
consommd of partridges ; put in truffles if your 
entries be (tux truffes. 

N? e.-^Bknd de Feau. 

Mark a few slices of Westmoreland ham (the 
• lean only) in a pretty thick stew-pan. Lay qver 
them pieces of sous de noix or contre noix of 
veal. You may also use some rump of veal. 
Pour into the stew-pan a sufficient quantity of 
grand consommd to cover about half the thick- 
ness of the meat. Let it sweat on a stove^ over 
a brisk fire.. Watch your stew-pan and the con- 
tents. When the broth is reduced, thrust a 
knife into the meat that all the gravy may ma 
cut ; then stew the sauce somewhat more gently. 
When the whole is absolutely h gtaccy you niust 
tet your blond de veau stew till of a light brownj^ 
but take care it does not burn^ to prevent which 
you put it on red hot ashes. Keep stirring your 
•tew^pan over the fire^ in order that the glac^ 



may be all of the same colour. Turn the meat 
upside down> that it may not stick. When 
your glace is of a dark: red colour^ mouillez with 
some hot broth ; let the glace detach before you 
put the stew-pan on the fire^ for it might still 
burn. Season with mushrooms and a bunch of 
parsley and green onions. When your blond de 
veau has boiled for an hour, it is done enough. 
Take off the grease^ ^nd drain through a silk 
sieve. 

N? 7-—- «^^ de Bosiif^ 

Trim> with layers of bacon, the bottom of 9 
tbick stew-pan ; cut four large onions by halveSj, 
l^y the flat part over the bacon ; take a few slices 
of beef, the.nou? or the sous noix'VLre the parts that^ 
are used in preference ; mark them in the same 
manner aa in the blond de veau, mouillez with 
the grand bouillon only. Let this sweat in order 
to get all the gravy out of the beef, and when 
the brotth is reduced, thrust a knife into the 
veat ; let it stew gently on a slow Are, till the 
gravy b.e of a light brown, without burning. 
Next mouillez with some grand bomlloi^, throvr 
ii^ a large bunch of parsley and of green onions, 
a little ss^lt and pepper corn. Let the whole boil 
for two- hours ; take the fat off, and drain it 
though* a. «ilk sieve^ to use it when wanted* 

B 3 



N? S.-^V Aspic, 

Takb a handful of arpmatic herbs, sucl) 
^ burnel^ chervil, and tarragon. Boil thosci 
herbs in white vinegar ; when the vinegar is well 
•oented, pouf into your stew-pan some cqmommi 
fk volaille reduced ; season well before you cli^ 
rify. If your aspic is high seasoned, break th? 
white of four eggs in an earthen pan, which beat 
with an osier rod ; throw your aspic into those 
whites of eggSjf and put the whole on the fire in 
a stew-pan; keep beating till your jjelly geta 
white, it is then very near boiling. Put it oo 
the comer of the stove, with a cover and a little 
fire on the top of it. When quite clear and 
bright, drain it through a bag or sieve^, to be 
used when wanted. 

iV. B. If you should want to use it for a mapor 
naise, or as a jelly in moulds, you must make 
f^ertain of its being stiff enough. If it be not, put 
more, either a knuckle of veal or a calTs foot ; 
which put into a stnall mould in ice, for trial $ 
when you may ascertain whether it may be use4 
|n large moulds, which, it is to be observed, rcr 
quire the jelly to be quite firm,^ you must use 
xnore of those parts that have neryes about theni« 

N? 9.— Je/^e de Fiande, for fie^ 
Tbb jele'f de viande for pies, is not to be prer

m 

pared in the same manner as the aspic. Neither 
aromatic herbs or vinegar are to be used. The 
jeUe is to be marked as follows : In a marmite 
put a good piece of round of beef^ two calPs 
feet, a few slices of veal, remnants of fowl, or 
game, according to the contents of your pies, 
two onions stuck with cloves, two carrots toumies^ 
four shalots, a bunch of parsley and green onions, 
some thyme, bay leaves, spices, &c. and a small 
piece of ham. Sweat the whole, then moisten 
with some good broth, let the marmite be cover- 
ed close, and those ingredients stew for four 
hours, but very gently. When done, taste it, 
season it well, and clariiy it as you do the aspi<u 
In order that it may keep the better, put it in 
the ice* 

* 

N? 10. — Le SuagCy or FEmpotage. 

Mark in a marmite twenty pounds of beef, a 
knuckle of veal, a hen, and if you have any 
remnants of fowl or of veal, you may put them 
in likewise. Mouillez this marmite with two large 
ladles full of broth. Sweat it over a large fire* 
Let it boil to glace without its getting too high in 
colour. Next fill it up with some grand bouillon 
that is quite hot. Put some vegetables into this 
marmite which is intended for making soup only. 
But you must put very few in the oonsojnm4$ 

B4 



trhich are to be reduced, a^nd wpvld b^ve a bitter 
tacite, if they were to retain that of the rootSj 
and accordingly not be fit to be used in delicate 
cookery* Lempotage requires no more than five 
hours to be done ; drain it through a silk sieve, 
and use it when you have occasion, 

• N? 1 1 .— Xc Comommi clarifii 

Is to be clarified as specified for the aspic^ and 
jeUe de viands. You must not forget thal^ such 
articles as are to be clarified rc<)uire njore hjgh.

N? 12.— Le Jusclair 

Ifli to be clarified with whites of egjgs^ or hhnd- 
de veau, or jus de bceuf. The blond de veau 
however is more mellow, and better suited for 
the table of the great* The jus de boduf may do 
for private families of the middle clasji. 

N? 13.— Le Bouillon de Santi. 

^ABi;. in an. earthen marmite. six ppunda of 
.round of beef« one half of a hen, an4 a knuckle 
of veal. Mouillez with cold water* Let it boil 
so that the scum only comes up by degrees, and 
that the broth may be quite clear and limped* 
When you have skimmed your marmite, throw, 
i|ito it two carrots^ two leeks^ and a head of 






a 

cole^s tvfto omo«i^ aifiol: with thrat olovoa, tkvM 
turnips, and a parwiep. Let the TKhole simmer 
gently for four houjrs. Then put a little salt 
to ity and skim off the grease or fat before you 
serve upt 

N? 14*— ^OMX blanc. 

Put a good lump of butter in. a stew^pap^ let 
it melt over a slow fire ; when melted^ powder 
it over and beat it with flour^ keep it on the fire 
for a quarter of an hour^ fry it wliite, pour it 
into an eajrtheh pan to use it when wanted. 

N? 15*— ZJoMo: blond. 

Put in a stew-pan a quantity of butter propor** 
tionate to * that you want to prepare^ Melt it 
geotly ; when melted^ if you mix any flour with 
it, you must stew it on a brisker iise^ and then 
piit it again over a very slow fire, till it be of a 
nice colour ; but mind this is to be procured only 
by slow degrees. When of a light brown you 
pour it into aa earthen pan^ and keep it for use. 

N? \6.—le CdulU. 

MAtiUiC the coulh in the same manner* as; the 
bfffnd de veau, with slices of ham, and sous now 
of veal, &c» When your gloffe is. of a. nice 
CQlqiir^ iQpipten it, aad let it stew enticely. You 



1« 

Biiist season it with a bunch of parsley and green 
onions^ mushrooms, &c. Then mix some rtnm 
Irun with the hlond de veau, but do not make 
them too thick, as you could not get the grease 
out, and that a sauce with the fat neither has a 
pleasing aspect or a .good taste. Let it stew for 
an hour on the comer of the stove, skim off the 
grease, and drain it through a tammy, &c« 

N? lf»— Graiwfe Espagnole. 

Besides a little ham, mark in a stew-pan som« 
pieces of veal, those parts namely that are called 
sous noix and contre noix* Mouillez the same as 
for the coulis; sweat them in the Hke manner ; let 
all the glace go to the bottom, and when of a 
nice red colour, mouillez with a few spoonfuls of 
consomm^ to detach the glace: you then pour in 
the coulis. LiCt the whole boil for half an hour,, 
that you may be enabled to remove all the grease. 
Drain it through a clean tammy. Remember 
always to put into your sauce some mushrooms, 
^ith a bunch of parsley and green onions. 

N? 18. '^Espagnole de GiUer. 

The same operation as above, except that in 
this you introduce the loins of either young or old 
partridges in order that your sauce may taste of 
game. Put them in the sweating. KemenibOT 



ihat such sauces as are kept too long on the fire 
Jose their savour. 

N? 19. — Sauce toum^e. 

Take some rotix blanc, dilute it with some 
consomm^ de volaiUe; neither too thin or too 
thick. I must repeat what I have already said, 
9 sauce when too thick will never admit dT the 
grease being removed. Let it stew on the comer 
of the stove. Throw in a few mushrooms, with 
^ bunch of parsley and green onions. Skim it 
well, and when there is no grease left drain it 
liirough a tammy, to use it when wantedf 

N? 20. — Sauce h tAllemande. 

This is merely a satice taum^e or season re- 
(duced, into which is introduced a thickening 
firell seasoned* 

N?3l.— LcTe/oii/A 

Take much about the same quantity of con^ 
fomm^ and of sauce toum^e, which reduce over 
a large fire. When your sauce is very thick^ 
you should have some thick cream boiling, 
frhich you pour into your sauce, and give them 
p couple of boilings ; season with a little salt, and 
drain through a tammy. If perchance the ham 
\>p too briny^ put in a little sugar. 



N? M.—VItalienne blanche. 
After having toumd some mushrooms^ throir 
them into a little water and lemon juice to keep 
them white. Formerly it was customary to use 
oil for these sauces, as on account of its being 
much lighter^ it would rise always to the top,, 
whereas in thick sauces butter never does. Thii» 
(^ration, hqwever, is useless. Put in a stew- 
pao two»thirds of sauce tourn^e, and one-third 
of consomm^i add two spoonfuls of mushroomsi 
cfaopt very fine, and especially of a white colour, 
half a spoonful of shalots. likewise chopt, well 

• 

washed. in the corner of a clean towel. Reduce 
this sauce^ season it well, and send it up. 

N? M. — LItalicnne rousse. 

It is requisite in a kitchen to have what is. 
commonly called an assiette, which is a dish, 
with four partitions^ intended for the reception 
of fine herbs. You must always.have ready some 
parsley chopt very fine, some shalots the same ; 
if the mushrooms were cbopt before-band tliey 
would become black ; therefore you only chop 
them when you have occasion for them ; the 
feurth partition is intended for the rejeption of 
hunches of parsley and green onions. The 
i)hopping and mincing cf the above is the 
business .of thjft apprentice,,. if there be one 



13 

under the head cook ; if not^ of the junior 
kitchen-maid. 

Take two spoonfuls of mushrooms^ one spoon- 
fill of shalots^ one ditto of parsley. Throw the 
whole into a stew-pan with two-thirds of Es-- 
pagnole, and one-third of consomind. Some 
people will add white wine to the sauce. In 
France where there was a choice of light white 
wines it might be done easily, biit in England 
where Champaign is the only wine that can be 
ifsed^ it would come too dear ; besides thq sauce 
may be made very good without any wine what* 
ever^ if you know how to work it well^ to its 
proper degree^ with a little salt> and still less 
pepper. Brown sauces ar^ not to be made thick. 
When your sauce is done enough, you must ahvft 
it into another stew-pan, and put it au bain 
marie. If you were not to skim this sauce with 
particular attention, you mi^ht skim off all the 
parsley, which is to bo avoided. 

N? 24. — La Sauce hacMe. 

This sauce although deldom, if ever, used in 
good cookery, is frequently to be met with at 
taverns aod inns on tho road. Such asr it is, iC 
is to be made in the following way. Chop somer 
girkins, mushrooms, capers, and anebovies, which 
throw into an Italienne rousse, and that is what 



14 

if called a mU6? hachie. Why have t called thii 
a tavern or cotnmoti iiin sauce ? Because it is not 
requisite to have an Italienne well prepared. A 
common browning made with butter and fldur^ 
moistened with a little broth^ or' gravy, and 
some fine herbs, will answer the purpose of thossi 
Vho knolv no better. 

N? 25,— La PoivraJe blanche. 

Pour into a stew-pan four spoonfuls of white 
vinegar, to which add some tarragon (if you 
have no tarragon, use tarragon vinegar), about 
twenty pepper corns ; reduce the vinegar to one* 
fourth oi its original quantity ; pour into the 
stew-pan six spoonfuls of sauce tourn^e, and two 
spoonfuls of consomm^; then reduce your sauce 
orer a large fire. Drain it through a tammy^ 
and then again lay it on the fire. Thicken it 
with the yolks of two ^gs, work it with a large 
lump of butter. In case it should happen to be 
brown, pour a spoonful of cream into it^ to re- 
store the white colour. 

N? 26.— La Paivrade blonde* 

In a small stew-pan mark a small carrot cut 

into dice, a few shalots the same, some parsley 

roots, some parsley, a few slices of ham, a clove, 

a little thyme^ the half of a bay leaf, a few 



16 

grains of pepper com and all-spice^ with a little 
mace. Let the stew-pan now be put on the fire, 
till it begins to be of a fine brown all round ; 
then keep stirring with a wooden spoon ; pour 
into the stew-pan four spoonfuls of white vine- 
gar, and a small bit of sugar. Let this reduce 
nearly h glace. Then tmmillez with some JSt- 
pagnole and a little consommS, that you may be 
enabled to take the grease off the sauce. Taste 
whether there be salt enough, but mind it is not 
to be too acid ; skim off the grease, and drain 
the sauce tlirough a tammy, and serve up. 

N? 27.-^1; Jspic lU. 

Put in a stew-pan with 9uch herbs as are 
called ramgottesy namely burnet, chervil, and 
tarragon* Add two or three spoonfuls of white 
vinegar, and let the herbs infuse on a slow fire 
for • half an hour. Then moisten with eight 
spoonfuls of Espagfiole : let the whole stew finr 
ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Season it 
well^ and serve up. 

N? 28.— La RaingotU. 

Tft^ same as above, except that instead of 
JSipagnole, you use sauce toumie. Let it boil 
for half an hour, then drain your sauce through

New white beans are the best suited for making 
^purie. Put them into boiling water if they be 
fresb^ and in cold water if they be dry, with a 
little butter in either case, which makes the skin 
more mellow. When they are done, throw in a 
handfut of salt to give them a seasoning. Fry 
a few slices of onion in a little butter; when 
they are of a nice brown colour, singez them 
with half a spoonful of flour ; lYumillez with a 
hlond de veau and season with a little salt and 
pepper, and skim off the grease. When the 
flour is done, mix it well with the beans, and

S? 56.—Fhhut^, a new Method. 

As it is not customary in England^ the same 
fis in France^ to allow a principal cook six assis** 
tants or deputies^ for half a dozen or even ten 
entries, I have thought it incumbent on me to 
abridge, to the best of my abilities, the varioiur 
preparations of sauces, &c. &c* I therefore put 
a few slices of Westmoreland ham at the bottom 
of a stew-pan, in which I mark a few slices of 
veal also, and over the veal, loins and parures of 
fowl. I pour in some good broth till it reaches 
the veal. ' (Observe you are not always to mark 
with grand bouillon, &c* &c. To be brief, I 
mark a marmite with a large piece ef beef^ a 



32 

knuckle of veal, a hqn^ wbich I boil till wdl 
skimmed. I then season with four carrots^ six 
leeks^ three large onions^ one of which is stuck 
with cloves^ two heads of celery> four large, turnips 
and a handful of salt. These I . stew gently, for 
about four or five hours, then drain the whole 
through a silk sicve^ and keep the liquor either 
for my soups, or to nwuiller my comomm^ and 
Espagnole.) When my sauce has been sweate4 
long enough, I mouille it with some boiling-hot 
broth, and throw into that consommi half a 
dozen mushrooms, a large bunch of parsley and 
green onions, and let them stew for an hour and 
a half. I then drain this consommd through a 
silk sieve, and reduce it. I have no occasion to 
use any sauce toumde^ because broth gets reduced, 
without one's being obliged to turn it; and 
that you must continually watch a sauce that has 
a thickening in it. I take four spoonfuls of tlie 
finest flour, which I mix with some good cream, 
though not too thick. When I have well work- 
ed my flour, I put about three pints of cream, 
which I keep turning on the fire that it may 
boil, before I expose my consomm^. When the 
cream boils I pour in the consomm^ that I have 
been reducing, and keep turning my sauce till 
such time as the flour be done. I add a little 
«alt if requisite, and then I put it through a tammy. 



This sSiuoe is the fundamental stone^ if I may; 
use the expression, of all sorts of little sauces i 
especially in England, where white sauces are 
preferred. From this motive I have left off the 
former method. In summer time I was not able 
to procure any butter that was fit to be used. 
I accordingly was forced to do without, and 
found out that my sauce was the better for it. 
You must always keep this ^ sauce very thick, as 
you may make it thin whenever you like, either 
with amsommiy or with cream. If it were too 
thin, it could not be used for so many purposes.

choose, but only at the last moment, and for 
two different reasons j the first, because they are 
liable to turn yellow; the other, because they 
would have a bitter taste. If you wish to serve 
any thing up with asparagus tops^ you must put

do not look well in a brown sauce. From this 
reason they are seen in Inacddoinesy Chartreuses^

you send up.

nice Espagnol, without frying them in butter, 
as many persons will have them. If your sauce

the same. Add a little sugar. With regard to 
salt it is needless to say, that not one single dish^ 
or sauce, is prepared without*

a very little fire in the said stove. You qext 
blanch them, and put them in a little blanCj by 
which is meant butter, salt, water, and slice of 
lemon. Try them frequently with a wooden 
spoon, lest they should be too much done. The 
kidneys are not to boil, for then they would 
break. The eggs are to boil a" little, in order 
that the first skin may come oflT. Now throw 
the whole into the blanc. As soon as the combs 
are done, you have ready a nice Espagnole re-

N? 72. — La Chamhord. 
This is a rago4t like the Jinanciire^ with 
this difference, that you must first reduce a pint 
of Madeira wine, which you mix with the Espa- 
gnole. You must also add to the above garnish, 
soft rows of carp, craw-fish of a large dimension^ 
and introduce a beurre d^anchois into the sauce. 
The quenelles are to be poached a la cullli^re. 
This to be performed requires too spoons : you 
fill one with the farce, which has been levelled 
all* round, with a knife dipped into boiling 
water. With the other spoon, which is lying 
also in boiling hot water, you take the quenelle 
out, and put into a stewi-pan that has been 
buttered. When you have thus marked your 
quenelles, you pour some boiling water into the 
9tew-pan, and boil them for a quarter of an 
hour. A small quantity of salt is required in 
the water. Some people will poach the quenelle 
in broth. • In my opinion it is wasting the broth 
to no purpose*

more v^al in your Espagnole. The moment it 
j^Ia^es, take part of the glace in a small stew

Observations relative to the Satices. 

Amongst the number of sauces that have been 
mentioned, many may be found that are not to 
be used. But I thought it incumbent upon* me 
to introduce them all^ for fear of incurring cen- 
sure. If four entries only are to T)e sent up to 
table, it would be ridiculous to make prepara- 
tions, that will answer the purpose of a grand 
afiair. Then instead of using grand bouillon^ 
suage, couUSi &c. merely mark a mamdte on 
the day preceding, or in case you should be at 
leisure in the forenoon. Take a quantity of meat, 
a fowl, and a knuckle of veal. 

When I am to send up a dinner of six or eight 
entrdeSy with a view of not carrying the expense 
to an extreme, I take a nice rump of beef, and 
about twelve pounds of buttock, a leg and 
knuckle of veal, and as I wish to have no waste, 
the rump is used to make a remove ; I make gre- 
nadinSf or JricandeaUy or quenelles^ with the noig 
of veal. By this means I reduce the expense. 
On tho preccd i g evening I put in a »Mir;/?/7e.the 



53 . 

twelve pounds of beef, the parure of th^ rump^ a 
knuckle of veal^ and a few other /?artire^ if I have 
any. Now I set this marmite skimming, and 
reason it with two large onions, one of which is 
«tuck with four cloves, three carrots, four large 
leeks, as many turnips, a head of celery, a little 
aalt, and I leave the whole to stew on a slow 
fire for five hours. I drain the broth through 
a silk sieve. I next skim the fat, or grease ; for 
if the broth of any description be not thus 
fikimmed, it will turn, sour in the course of the 
night On the next day I mark my sauces with 
that bouillon i and the day on which I am to 
«erve my dinner, I make another marmite with 
my rump, a knuckle of veal, and a fowl, seasoned 
-in the same manner as that above. This bouillon 
1 use for my potages ^nd to moisten my braize. 
I mark in a stew-pan thin slices of ham, and 
a few slices of veal, moistened with some of ray 
bouillon, which I reduce cl glace. When it 
begins to thicken, so as to stick,* I put the stew- 
pan on a very slow fire, in order that the glace 
may get a good colour without burning. I 
then moisten with the broth, to which I add a 
bunch of parsley and green onions, igid a few 
mushrooms, and stew them for an hour. Next 
I make row*, which I moisten with the blond de 
veauy and keep some for the gravy of my rdts. I 

£ 3 



54 

•kim all the grease off from my sauee^ reduelr 
it^ and use it when I have occasion. 

For white sauces I mark the slices of ham^ a 
few pieces of veal with the bones and remnants 
of fowl^ which r moisten with the same lumillon^ 
as I have done my ooulis^ or my Eipagnole. 
When my meat is sweated through^ 1 cover it 
entirely with boiling hot broth, season with a 
bunch of parsley and green onions and m feW 
mushrooms, and stew the whok for an hour 
and a half. This consommi I use to make 
either the velout^y N? 56, oc la sauce toumdc, 
which is the key to all other thick sauces, &c 

The marmite must be put on the fire at an 
early hour. Your rump of beef must be kqpt 
hot Reduce to glaze the broth diat you have 
left after having marqui every article. This 
glace may serve either to strengthen or to glazer 
If you are frequently set to work, you must 
always have a little gtace ready. By this means 
you have no occasion to reduce your liquor tiU 
the following day^ and k will serve for the 
morrow.

N? 23. — Potage h la Reitie: a new Method. 

For twelve people take in preference three 
fat chickens or pullets, which are generally better 
than fowls : skin them, take out the lungs, wash 
them clean, and mark them in a pan with a 
bunch of parsley only ; moisten the whole with 
good boiling broth : let it stew for an hour and 
a half^ then take out the chickens: soak the 
crumb of two penny loaves in the broth ; take 
off the flesh of the chickens, and pound it with 
the yolks of three or four eggs boiled hard, and 
the crumb pf bread which has been sufficiently

soaking in the broth. Rub the whole through « 
tammy ; then take a quart of cream, which lay 
on the fire, and keep stirring continually till it 
boils. Pour it into the sOup. It is not liable 
to curdle as when the other method is used, and 
it tastes more of the chickens. If you think 
proper to add either barley, rice, or vermicelli, 
let it stew in broth, and only pour it into the 
soup when quite done. 

N? 24. — Semouille au Consomm^.

Take one or two spoonfuls of this flour, and 
dilute it with broth, rather coy than hot. AU 
this time you hare some broth •'on the fire; 
throw the flour of rice thus diluted into the brothy ' 
and keep stirring till you find the soup is hot

broth, and let the whole sweat over a slow fire. 
When the meat is hot to the middle, you cover 
it entirely with boiling broth, and let the

more cabbages which are to be washed clean

the cabbages are not made rich and mellow they 
are good for nothing. You may add to the 
above either sausages, bacon, or stewed legs of 
geese if you have any: mind above all things 
that the cabbage be not too briny, for the soup 
then would not be eatable. When the cabbage

N? l.-^De ta Cuhttt, or th^ Rump of Beef

BoKE !t^ tie it found with packthread, and

broth. When done draiti it a quarter of an hour 
before dinnei- time, that you may trim it well and 
gla2e it several times. Difth it with paisley all 
found* 

Several people braize the rUmp of beef, 
'which I do not approve, as it gets too high 
seasoned for people who have so many other 
things to eat. The sauces and garnitures that 
are served at the same time are sufficiently 
seasoned, without the beef being so likewise. 
Besides the first method is the most economical 
aiT the rump braize furnishes too rich liquor to be 
UMd in delicate cooking. Moreover when boiled

in the common way, the rump is more whole*- 
some^ makes mori liroth, aad therefore deserves 
the preference. However, not to disappoint 
such as might like it, I shall proceed to treat of

It was customary in France to cut off a small

Scale your pike and let it disgorge in water for 
an hour or two. Then lard it in difierent places 
on one side of the back, and bake it in a mari* 
node au vin, as you would do in the marinade a 
la Gendvoise. That part which has been larded 
must stand uppermost, to prevent the other 
getting dry. Cover this with layers 'of bacon, 
and be particular in basting frequently with the 
seasoning. When your fish is done, glaze the 
parts th^t have been larded, and mask the others 
with a raji&dt a la Chambord. Observe that 
the quenelles must be made of fish. The garn- 
ish is generally composed of large quenelles, 
small pigeons innocents, (squab pigeons) larded 
sweetbread of lamb, &c« Take a little of the 
marinade, skim off the grease, reduce it nearly

without their getting too much colour. Tbea 
pour in two bottles of white and a bottle of red 
wine with salt, &c. This marinade being stewed 
properly will serve several times for stewing the

FARCES, OR FORCED MEAT. 



N? 1. — CbieneUes de Veau. 

Takb a sous mnx or a oontre noh of veal* Cut 
it into slices, wbich scrape with your knife till 
you have got off all the meat without the nenres. 
About half a pound of this raspt meat is 8u& 
fident for an entrSe. You have boiled either in 
your marmite^ or in plain water, a calTs udder« 
When it is cold yiou trim all the upper part, cut 
it into small pieces and pound it in a mortar tiii 
it can be rubbed through a sieve. All that part 
that has bten thus strained dirough the sieve, 
you make a ball of, and of the sam^ size as your 
meati which you have al^ rolled in a ball ; you 
then make a pamule in the following manner. 

Panades fw Farces in general. 

Soak in milk the crumb of two penny rolls 

for about half an hour ; then take it out, and 

squeeze it to draw ont all the milk. Put that 

-^rumb in a stew-^pan with a little sauce toumde ; 

I 2 



116 

a little cansomm^g and some fine herbs, that is 
to say a little parsley, and a few mushrooms, 
. and if approved of^ a few shalots or very small 
green onions. Stew those herbs in a little but* 
ter for a moment, to do away their crudity* 
Then set them to reduce with yom* panade^ 
which you must keep stirring constantly with a 
wooden spoon. When your panade begins to 
get dry in the stew-pan, introduce a small lump 
of butter, which assists in drying your panade 
without its stidcing to the pan. When it is 
quite firm, take it off from the fire, and mix 
with it the yolks of two eggs. Then let it eool 
to use it when wanted. Your panade must 
always be prepared before hand, in order to havt 
it cold, for it cannot be used when hot or eveik 
.wsrm. When your panade in cold, you roll 
it into balls, the same as tlie two other articles, 
hut let the .balls be all of a size. Pound the 
.mdiole in a mortar as long as possible, for the 
more quenelles are pounded, the more they are 
delicate. Then break two eggs, whites and 
yolks together, which you pound likewise ; now 
season with pepper, salt, and spices in powder ; 
when the whole is well mixed tc^ether, try a 
ismall quenelle, which you roll with a little flour; 
then poach it in boiling wat^ with a little salt. 
If it be not firm enougb^ put another egg with" 



117 

out lt>eating the white^ which only makes the 
quenelles flat^ and hollow inside. When yoii 
Jiave made your farce rub it through a sieve. 

Several people who use the same ingredients 
as I do, but not in the same way, will perhaps 
feel inclined to censure my method ; yet such as 
ivUl adhere to it will derive great benefit. 

N? ;2. — Quenelles de VolaiUes. 

The quenelles de volailles are made with the 
fillets only, all other parts being too full of 
tierves. Take the fillets of young ordinary 
chickens, for you must never use those of an 
old fowl. Veal when very white, is even better 
than fowls if they be tough. Cut your meat 
into dice and pound it in a mortar, till it can be 
rubbed through a sieve. Next make three balls, 
as you have done for the quenelles of veal. Then 
pound, season, and try them in the same man-» 
ner as indicated above, as they must be made 
firm, or soft, according to the use they are in- 
tended for. Quefielles au consommi clarifidj for 
instance, must be very delicate and soft. If 
they are to be served in a ragoAty be it either 
white or brown, they must be made more firm^ 
and so on. The farce h quenelles is made great 
use of in cookery. They alone make various 
^[ood entries, and serve besides to garnish \h^

If you 9ire enabled to use fiUets onljr^ they 
inake the best quenelles. If you are en^ged 
with a nobleman who has game in abiiii4atee^ 
take the fillets for your quenelles ; with the legs 
and shoulders make a gibhtte, or a pye English 
fashion for the servaots^ and with the remaining 
parts you make your consammd* When you lift 
up the fiUets you must l^ave the qervesi about 
the carcase. Pound your npeat aqd make a 
panade as for other queneUe^n Take a calPs 
udder likewise^ which prepare as abpve indicated^ 
Quenelles are di^ereat in ta3te and ^peUatioQ ; 
only in consequence of the meat they 4re made 
of. Remember that the panade and calPs udder 
%fe indispensable articles. Sa foUow what I have 
prescribed in N? Ij for th« quemelks. of vmI 
which I haye mentioned the first, as beii^ more 
frequently used than all ptbers* They are very

Take the white flesh of a fowl that has been 
roasted ; take off the skin and nerves, chop your

other Jarces. Put \n the yolks of your ^;gs 
only, after having pounded your Jarce, and

N? 6. — Farce h Gratin de LapreauXf Perdreaux, 

Poulets, &c. 
. The force h gratin is made in the same man- 
ner as the farce h la Crime, with the only dif- 
ference that you must not beat the whites of 
your eggs^ and that this^r^ is to be kept 
delicate and soft. Take the flesh of roasted 
chickens, or young rabbits, or young partridges^ 
&c. The manner of using it is explained in its 
proper place. The^rce is intended for the stuf- 
fing of such articles ;as are not to be put on the 
fire again^ such as calfs ears, calfs feet, sheep's 
trotters en canelouy and risisoUes, as also quails, 
tongues, and larks au gratin. There are some 
gratins that are also imincis, and are treated of 
lo their proper plap^s, 

N? 7» — Boudins h la Richelieu. 

. As soqn as you have rubbed your farce a 
pLcnelles through a sieve, you have some onions 
cut sideways into diceSj and that have been 
sweated white, which you fnix with your farce 
before it is got firm, because the onion then 
does not break. . But if you should wait till the 
farce is firm, the onions will break. The houdins 
a la Richelieu are a farce h queneUes either of 
fowl or of veal, as they are never made of game. 



121 

N? "S.^^Boudin^ a la Sefhn. 
These are made with quenellfs as tbogq abov^ 
pn\y instead of onions sliced sideways, yofi put 
iDUshrooms, sliced in the same manner^ and 
sweated white in butter. When you drain your 
mushrooms preserve the liquor^ which pour intq 
the sauce that serves for the houdins. The 
flavour of mushrooms must prevail in these 
boudins^ the same as that of onions prevails ii| 
the baudms a la RicheUetu 

N? 9. — Quenelles de Merlans. 

Take the fillets of four whitings. If in a 
Roman Catholic family on a fast day, instead of 
an udder use butter. The panade however is far 
superior lyhen at^ gras^ In the former case you 
soak yoiir cri^mb of bread in some good milk^ 
and squeeze it well in a towel. Do pot put the 
same quantity of butter^ as you would of udd^r, 
as the butter would not keep in. In every other 
respect these are made like other quenelles. 

N? 10. — Farce de Carpes, pour les Diners en 

Maigre. 

Take the flesh of two carps, which chop, 
pound, aiyi rub through a sieve. Soak some 
crumb of "bread in some good milk ; have a few 
^ushrooms and a little parsley chopt very fine* 



Set your bifrbs sweating in a Ktde butter^ over a 
very slow fire. Hien let your herbs cool in a 
hair sieve. Next put the breads that has be^n 
soaked and squeezed properly, with the flesh of 
Ihe carp that has been rubbed through a tammy 
into a mortar, with a lump of butter of about the 
same bulk as the flesh of the carp, and season 
with pepper, salt, all-spice, three or four eggs, 
whites and yolks together, for farces with butter 
require more eggs than those with udder. Yet 
before you put more than three^ you must try 
to roll some of the Jarce in a little flour, and to 
poach it in boiling water. You then taste and 
ad^ to the seasoning if required. When com- 
pletely ^one, you rub it through a sieve, and 
let it cool in the larder, and use it when you 
have occasion. This Jarce is used for petty 
patties of carp. We also make quenelles for 
matehftes en maigre, &c. 

K? 1 1 . — Farce de Crodiveau, pour les P4t4s & 

la Mazarine, &c. 

Take three-quarters of a pound of very white 
veal, a pound and a half of beef suet, which 
you strip of all the sinewy skins, chop your suet 
separately, and your veal the same. When you 
have chopt them both, take some herbs such as 
parsley, shalots and mushrooms^ which you chop 



123 

also very fine^ and sviKeatiDg in a Ktile butter^ mix 
tiie whole together, veal, suet, ai^d herbs, which 
season with pepper and salt* Then ehop them 
again. Break two eggs, yolks and whites, and 
if yoar godiveau appears to be well mixed, put a 
Utile piece to tiie oven in a small tart mould. 
If it rises well^ and is properly seasoned, that i& 
a sign of its being done : if not put it into the 
mortar again with a little milk. 

By dint of practising a great deal, you^are 
liable, to observe accidents which cannot be duly 
explained. In the summer season for instance, 
the suet being very soft, you find more difficulty 
in using it. If you have any good ice, put some 
small pieces into the go^veau, to make the 
meat and suet combine better. 

N? 1 2.— -Rwce Marhr^e Ferte. 

Makb a farce a quenelles as indicated above. 
Take part of it, and mix it with a verd de persU 
(see Sauces) which you have drained, in order 
the water may not make your farce tliinner. If 
you wish to use it quite of a green colour, you 
do not mix it ; but if you intend to marble either 
galantines J or fillets of soles, you put on slightly 
a part white, and another green. You then roll 
and poach them, and when they are cut they 
look like marble. 



124 

N? \3.r^Farce Marhrie Rouge. 
This, is much the same as4he former. In 
France we made use of a heurre d'dcrevisses^ 
for poulets a la Cardinal, or red and marbled 
Janes. In England the eggs of lobsters are 
more frequently used^ which are not amiss for 
farces of fish. But for farces of volaille, ot 
of veal> <u*aw-fish, is far preferable, nay requi- 
site. (See Sauces, heurre d'^crevisses.) 

N? 14. — Farce it LiSvre et h Dindon. 

. Take half a pound of beef suet, chop it very 
fine, some parsley likewise, a little thyme, pep- 
per, salt, crumbs of bread, lemon peel also 
chopped very fine, an egg or two, and mix the 
whole with a little .milk. It would not be amiss 
to pound the whole in a mortar for a moment. 
This farce may be used with baked pike, boiled 
turkey with celery or oysters ; iu short with all 
such articles as will be indicated in this work. 

N? 15.— Farce A Pdt^. 

Take an equal quantity of veal and of fat 
bacon; chop them tc^ther, season them with 
pepper, salt and all- spice, but no herbs which 
only .damage the pye. If it is to be eat imme** 
diately, you may however introduce a littlo 
chopt parsley^ and shalots^ and ma|^e ^ vdt^. 



125 

aux truffieSy or chop some truffles which you 
mix with the farce. In pies made of game you 
may chop soni# ham^ but )n those made of 
fowl^ the saltpetre gives a red colour to the 
meat^ which can never look too white. 

N? 16. — Farce €b' Saucisses* 

Sausagei^ are only composed of bog^s flesh ; 
but as it is customary to stuff turkeys with this 
Jixrce^ I have thought proper to mention it here. 
Take all the tender parts of the meat, the nerves 
being left aside when the hams and breasts are 
cured, which will be found treated of in a sepa- 
rate article. Cut the whole of the meat into 
smalt diet ; then cut nearly about the same 
quantity of fat into small dice also. Chop and 
mix them well together ; fat and lean, season 
with pepper and salt, all-spice, and a little mint 
chopt very fine. All these ingredients give the 
sausages a very pleasing taste.

Palates of beef are always prepared in the 
same manner as indicated in N? 1. The only 
ditfereiice consists in the diitting of them^ and 
in the sauce with which they are sent up to 
table. Take some sauce d*attelets, (see Sauces) 
and after having cut your palates into square 
pieces of whatever dimension you may think 
proper, let them cool in the sauce. When quite 
cold run a silver skewer through them in a row^ 
and cover all the meat with some of the sauce. 
Make your pieces as smooth as possible with 
your knife. Next dip them into crumbs of 
bread, and make them quite square. Mind that 
both extremities be well covered with the crumbs 
into which you dip them a second time, after 
having previously used an omelette; likewise 
that both ends of the skewers be remarkably 
clean. Then fry your palates to a fine brown, 
and serve them up with an Italienne rousse^ 
(See Sauces.)

N? \.—Cdteletie de Mmim h h Saubise^ 

You take a carri de nmitan^ and eut ^

off the flat bone at the extremity of the chops* 
Then mark them in a stew-pan with all yo«r 
parureSf likewise with the jmrurea of yow 
^oos for la saubise. Season the whole w^U 
with carrots^ and bancb of parsley and green 
(Dnionsy salt,* and a very small quantity of 8pie% 
^. throw in four or five spoonfuls of good broth^ 
%o bruize them. When done drain them, and 
Jet them cooL Strain the liquor- through a silk 
sieve. Then reduce it to glaze. Next pareM 
your chops nicely and put them with the gUze# 
This being eooipteted^ dish thenk f^ mirotan, 
find pour the souhise in the middle. 

Some people will take two carries de twutonf 
pni cut two bones to each chop, lard them with 
^wioon, and bruize them as above. But mutton 



138 

being in general fat, it is better not to lard them. 
With regard to the two bones, you must make 
them as flat as aboVe, for if tob thick you cannot 
dish them well. 



Another Method- ^preparing les Cdtekttes ^ 

la Soubise. 

You cut your mutton chops a little thicker 
than when you wish to broil them. Parez 
ifaeni nicely, and put them into a stew-pan, 
where they may all lay flat. Put an onion or 
two, a few carrots toum^es^ a little salt, four or 
five spoonfuls of good cdnsonvme^ and sweat thd 
Whole till it be entirely done. Then take out 
the roots, put in a little glaze, and reduce over 
a lai^e fire. When entirely sur glace^ lay them 
on a cover to drain the grease, and serve up 
before they can get dry. This method is prefer- 
able to the other. In neither case must you 
lard your chops with bacon. 

« 

N? a.— Les Cdtekttes en Haricot Vierge. 

Prepare your chops as above. Braize them 
in the like manner. As several people' do not 
like onions, serve them with a haricot vierge

139 

m a.—Cdtekites h la Mnute, 
Take the best part of a neck of < mutton that

Season them with pepper and salt, dip them 
into some melted butter, and broil them over a

N? 6. — Cdtelettes en Haricot brun. 

Several people braize and glaze them, and 
put the haricot brun iii the middle, but I will 
explain the manner in which they are to be 
prepared, ia order that they may taste of the 



140 

ttiriiips. Cot your chops m in N? I^ parez the 
booes nicely^ thrp fry then in a little butter; of 
H nice brown colour^ dnin this butter^ and make 
n ronx very ^/p^^t Moisten with some blond th

your sauce boils^ throw in your chops, and let 
tbem stew gently o|i the porner of the stove. 
Skim the sauce freqi;ently x when the chops ate 
doi)e» drain them ip a clean stew-pan. Have 
iMdy SQipe turnips tprned in whatever -shape you 
think proper, but not too small fpr this entrie, 
drain yapr sauce through # tanuay over the 
turnips^ which stew in t^is sauce with a little 
MV^T. Continue skimming frequently. When 
your turnips im done mix the whole together, 
chops and all, and warm them au bain mme ^ 
or give them one boil or two ths^t they ynay taste 
of tbe turnips. 

iVlB.^-^Some peojjfle will fry the turnips in 
batter to make them brown^ which is useless^ as 
they will lo^k very well, provided the blond dei 
veau be of a fine colour. 

N? 7. — Lea Cdtelettes santies h V Essence.

. N? 14. — Le Fricandeau aux diffirentes Pur4e$* 

Fricandeau is a very good enMe when made 
with due care and attention^ but it is seldom 
cooked with that degree of perfection which it 
requires. 

To make a good JricandeaUy your veal must 
be of the best quality^ which you may know by 
the meat being white^ and not thready. Take 
off the skin of a noix de veau, flatten it on a 
cloth or a clean towel, then at one stroke level 
it with your knife, for a fricandeau that is cut 
off at several times never looks so well. When 
you have pari the top part, turn it round, 
make slits in the middle, that it may taste more 
of the seasoning. Now lard it very thick, which 
is not generally done properly in England. The 
consequence is, that the bacon not being laid 
sufficiently crossways, the shreds shrink, and 
cannot be properly glazed. Never blanch your 
fricandeau after it has been larded, as some 
people will, but mark it in a stew-pan large 
enough to contain the fricandeau besides plenty 
of roots cut into slices, such for instance as two 
carrots, two large onions, and some roots of 

M 



162 

parsley, besides a small quantity of mace, all- 
spice, thyme, bay-leaves, and whole peppek*. 
Put all these in tlie bottom of your stew- 
pan, with layers of very fat bacon, on the top of 
the vegetables, as lean bacon gives a red colour 
to the Jricandeaun When yon have thus wed 
covered your roots, «rect a small dome in the 
centre, lay the meat over the bacon, powder a 
little salt over the Jricandeauj and moistea with 
a sufficient quantity of broth to cover tlie roots 
without reaching the said fricandeau. Then 
put a great deal of fire on the cover o\ the stew- 
pan, keeping very little beneath the stew-pan* 
It is not amiss to observe Uiat Xhe fricandeau 
being done in this way retains a good shape, and 
all its gravy. 

If you should wish to cook it, as I am farther 
going to direct, the moment it is parti (which 
signifies when it begins to boil) you put it over 
a very slow, equal fire, for three hours and a 
half, if it be not very large. Baste it frequently 
with the liquor: then take a needle a bnider, 
which run through the middle : if it gets in and 
comes out easily, the Jricandeau then is done 
enough. Now again put a great deal of fire over 
it to make the bacon firm, which otherwise 
would break, th time you glaze it. The liquor 
reduced is to be used to glaze the Jricandedu. 



163 

Serve up with that the fwrie the season will 
afford, or la Mac^doine, &c. (See Sauces.) 

JV.JB. The fricandeau may vary with regard 
to the shape, but the savour is filways the same, 
if it be done properly* If for instance a /H- 
candeau is to be served when there is a grand 
party it is requisite to give it another shape thai;i 
&r a fiimily dinner. Though an expensive dish 
when served alone, it becomes rather cheap if 
there be a grand dinner, as veal in abundance is 
wanted to make the broths and sauces. The 
fiaix de veau besides glaze, will supply a very 
elegant and good entrSe^ In the summer season 
you give it the shape of a turtle. You cut off 
p^rt of each extremity of your fricandeau, you 
take the tops of asparagus which you lay beneath 
after having poured in a Macddoine. Have four 
braized lettuces ready, put one at eaeh corner^ 
as sham claws. Asparagus and lettuce eat well 
with a Machine and of course they may be 
used without any danger of their being disap- 
proved of. In the winter season you make 
quenelles of veal, which you place instead of the 
above* mentioned articles, and serve up with an 
E^qgnole. 

Another Method. 

Whin yom fricandeau is fully lardtd, split 

M 2

it through the middle. Take a tcry large 
turnip, or a piece of cold veal, which has been 
used to make a sauce, cut either round, or oval, 
wrap it up in bacon, and thrust it within the cleft^ 
which you have practised in the fricandeau. 
Mark this as the other, and let it be done in 
the like manner. You must observe that it will 
be done sooner, that is in less time. Glaze it. 
Now take either French beans, or asparagus; 
place them erect inside of the two extremities of 
the cleft, and pour a Macedoine between, with 
a very large sweetbread larded and glazed over 
the middle, which produces a very pleasing 
effect. 

The same may be done for a fricandeau en 
puitSy with a hlanquette in the middle. 

N? 16. — Les Grenadine h la purSe de C^kri

manner. Out of a noix of veal you may make 
two or three grenadins according to its size. It 
is no easy matter to explain the manner of cut- 
ting them; let it suffice to say, that being much 
thinner than a fricandeau, they naturally are 
(Jonc in less time. They are served up with a 
Macedoine, or with all sorts of purdes.

N? l6.— La Noix de Veau en Bedeau. 

It is so called because in France the parish 
beadles wear gowns of two colours^ one half of 
one colour^ the other half of another. Parez 
this is as follows. 

Take the noix of a young heifer. If intended 
for an entree choose the s^nallest you can pro-^ 
cure ; if for a remove^ the largest that can be 
got. Flatten it a little retaining the udden 
Form a crescent on the border of the fat, and 
parez that part where there is no fat. Lard it 
as ajricandeau; let it be done in the same 
manner, only cover with bacon the part that is 
not larded, in order to keep it white, and glaze 
it slightly when done. Being done in the same 
style as the fricandeau it is served up with the 
same sauces. 

N? 17.— ^cawA la Bourgeoises 

The only part which I could wish to recom- 
mend in this case is the cassis, which is fat, and 
a luscious eating. It is not generally sent up 
when there is a grand dinner, but for a family* 
dinner it may prove very acceptable indeed. 
The plain way of cooking this, I reckon the best, 
and will explain it accordingly. Take a stew-pan 
large enough to make your veal 6rm in a little 
butter; when it is of a fine brown colour all 

M 3

rounds put in a f^w caffotd^ otiioiid^ spiCes^ a 
tittle lean bacon^ and two cair^ feet seasoned 
with pepper^ satt^ tbyme^ &c. Moisten with 
two spoonfuls of brotb^ and let the wbole stew 
for a eouple of hours on a very slow fire. When 
done drain the grease^ take out the spice and 
serve up the veal^ with the roots all round. 

N? l8«-*-£e» Ris de Veau h la Dauphincr 

If you use round dishes, you must have four 
sweetbreads ; if a long dish three large ones will 
be sufficient. Mind, at any rate, to select them 
of a large size and very white. Parez the nerves 
and the fat; throw them into warm water to 
draw out the blood and make them as white as 
possible. When thoroughly disgorged, blanch 
them a little, that you may lard them with 
greater facility. As soofi as they are larded, rub 
a stew-pan all over with butter, lay your sweet- 
breads over the butter, powder them over with 
salt, and stew them with a deal of fire on the 
top, and very little beneath. When they are 
come of a fine brown, cover them with a round 
of paper, and lessen the fire on the top. If 
they be large it will require three-quarters of an 
hour to do them. If they be too much done they 
become soft, and are not so palatable. When 
properly done, drain them, and put them in % 



pM With tome glaze, and tile bacon beneath. 
Xieave them in the glaze till dinner time ; then 
drain them afresh, and glaze them of a fine 
brown. Serve them up with la chicorie au

When cold cut into scollops, and put it into 

»the sauce hlanquette^ (See Sauces.) Take six 
fine cucumbers, cut them into quarters, parez 
them about the size of your scollops : then^take 
the parures and some other pieces which mince 
with a little onion. Fry the whole together 
in a little butter ; when your cucumbers are en- 
tirely melted, moisten with a sauce toum^ey and 
stew them on the corner of the stove for an hour ; 
skim off the grease, and rub the sauce through 
a tammy. Put the other cucumbers, in some 
sauce toum^e, and let them boil till done. Then 

' lay them in a hair sieve to drain. Put together 
your puree of cucumbers and the sauce toum^e 
when- you have boiled the cucumbers, being suf- 
ficiently reduced, thicken it with yolks of eggs 
well beaten and seasoned with salt and sugar. 
When your sauce is well thickened with the 
aforesaid articles and a little thick cream, you 
put in your meat and cucumbers, and keep your 
sauce hot, that the meat may have a better 
savour. This entree must be sweet.

made out of a carrot, or some other substance,

the same length ; cut the flesh of the chickens 
into fillets, add a fevir slices of veal; of those 
form kind of beds, in such a manner as when 
they are cut they may be checquered; then 
close the skin of the chicken, sow up the back^ 
give it a nice shape before you put it in the stew- 
pan. You must have some calfs foot jelly 
ready, for the chicken is much sooner done than 
the calfs foot ; then mark the chicken in a stew^ 
pan, and. cover it with layers of bacon ; season 
it with a bunch of parsley and small onions, 
some thyme, a bay-leaf, a clove, a little spice, 
a few carrots, a couple of onions, and slices of 
yeal ; then mix a little broth and a small quanr 
tity of the jelly. The ^chicken must not boil 
above an hour. , 

Th^n take it off from the fire, and let it cool 
in the liquor, that the slices may stick together 
on account of the jelly, for were this neglected 
the galantine would break to pieces on being 
cut. If you send it up hot, you pour over i( 
such sauce as you think proper, but it must be 
a brown sauce, or sorrel, or onions made brown 
in an Espagnole : however it is much bettter 
to serve a galantine cold with jelly : take some 
of the liquor, beat the white of two or three 
eggs, which you mix with the cold jelly after 
having skimmed oflf the grease, then again put 
the whole on the fire, and keep stirring till the

You must have a mould ribbed like a melon ;

chicken larded with bacon, and others decorated 
with trufiles. Have sweetbreads of lamb already 
done, one of which put between each rib, and 
]the thickest part of the JSfets mignons. When 
you have thus arranged alternately one slice 
larded and another decorated with trufiles, cover 
the whole of your fillets with a farce fine. (See 
farce fne.) Put a thick salpiconxn the centre 
and cover it with the farce over, stick it with 
farce meat, then put tbe mould in au bain marie 
in order to poach the whole at a time ; next turn 
the grenade on a dish ik entries, dry the larded

you cover also with thin slices of bacon, pour 
the bread in the middle of your entrie dish, 
then lay the farce h quenelles all round, of the

fillets into the Jarce h quenelles ; they are not to 
be stuck perpendicularly, but at equal distances : 
leave a separation between each fillet to make 
room for cock*s-kidneys of an equal size. These 
are to be put in only when you are going to 
send up : cover your dish with an earthen pot, 
or a lid that closes hermetically. The turban 
is to be put into the oven, and when done glaze 
the fillets by means of the salamander. Prac* 
tice small holes for the admission of the cock's- 
kidneys, which must be very white, and bear 
a resemblance to as many pearls. If you have 
nothing to cover the dish, use layers of bacon, 
but a plain cover is still preferable, as it yields 
no grease, and that the quenelles are better and 
more easily poached.

CHAR X- 



ENTRfiES OF PARTRIDGES, 

YOUNG AND OLD. 



N? 1. — A whole Partridge it TEspagnole. 

It is necessary to observe, that except for 
perdream oux choux, or perdreaux a la pur^e de 
lentilleSi young partridges are required: these 
in general have yellowish <;laws, yet it may 
happen that althobgh they be still tender, the 
claws and legft may be of a grey or even of a 
bluish colour. Look at the extremity of the 
wingi if it be sharp pointed and whitish, the 
bird is still tender, but if the above marks are 
not to be seen^ the bird is invariably old, and 
consequently un6t to be used, except as above^ 
mentioned, or for sauces, consomm^s^ and cold 
patties. 

The size of the dish must determine the num* 
her of birds you are to dress ; in general three 

a 4 



9^2 

are wanted^ you empty them as usual, and take 
care not to injure the skin : pick them well, mix 
a little butter, salt, and lemon-juice: put an 
equal proportion inside of each bird ; cut off the 
nerve that is under the joint of the legs, truss the 
legs up towards the breast: you then sew up 
the birds in the following manner. You first 
prick the aiguille h brider (the needle) tbreugh 
the stump of the right wing, then through the 
thick joint of the leg, and next across the body i 
then again through the other stump ; let the 
packthread be very tight, and fasten the knot« 
Now from the back ran the needle through the 
side beneath the leg, then above the pinion 
below the breast, so as to perforate the breast 
bone: let the needle come out from the part 
parallel to that where first it was introduced, and 
then from through the side to the back, and 
fasten the packthread. Give a good shape to the 
birds; which constitutes a true knowledge of 
the art of cookery. A man cannot be really a 
thorough good cook unless he be well acquainted 
with every branch of the art. How to trasa 
poultry or game is not to be easily explained in 
a book : you may as well try to have drawing 
learnt without a master, or patterns. Seasoning, 
and marking may be elucidated, but practice 
alone can make a man perfect. Such however 



233 

«8 have been initiated may derive great advan-r 
tage from such a work as this. Mark the par- 
tridges between layers of bacon^ the same as 
legs of fowl, and pour a po'ele over them : if you 
happen to have no po'ele ready, use some c^ the 
pot-top, with a little salt, parsley, and onion&i 
well seasoned. They will be done in the icourse 
of twenty minutes, but let it be on a slow fire ; 
drain and put them in the dish and pour an Es^ 
pagnole over them, wherein you introduce a 
little glace de perdreatm* (See Sauces.) 

N? 3. — YiYung Partridges h la Montntorend. 

Takb some young partridges which empty, 
and truss as in N? 1, dip the breasts into boiling 
water ; when made firm, dip them immediately 
into cold water : next lard them with thin slits 
of bacon ; mark them in a stew-pan with slices 
of fat bacon all around only, pour a little foile 
or any other liquid to immerse about one halC 
of the birds. Have a brisk fire over them to 
seize the bacon ; when they have been stewed 
for twenty minutes, you glaze them, and probe 
them near the back ; if no blood issues it is a 
sign that they are done enough. Drain them, 
glaze them a second time, and send them up 
with a ragofdt 4 la Jitutncihe. 



234 

N? i.^^Foung Partridges h la Barbaric. 
; Truss the birds as in N? 1, instead of butter 
stuff them with chopped truffles and rasped 
bacon, seisLsoned with sailt, pepper, and all- 
spice: then cut. small pieces of truffles; in the 
shape of nails ; with a penknife make holes ia 
the breasts of the birds, widen the holes with a 
st:ewer and jQll them with the truffles, let them 
be nailed in very regular. Then mark them as 
ia N? 1/ They are to be stewed also in the 
same manner. Serve them with ah Itdlienne 
aux truffes. (See Sauces.) 

N.B. Take care to drain them well, otherwise 
the grease would spoil both the taste and look of 
the sauce. 

N? 4. — Young Partridges h la Dreux. 

This is nearly the same as the foregoing dish, 
only instead of using truffles you lard with small 
pieces of ham : use the pen-knife, as larding 
pins would spoil the look of the birds, &c. that 
are served entire. Mark and stew as above and 
serve up with the essence de gibier. (See 
Sauces.) 

N? 5. — JToung Partridges h la Crapan£tw. 

Cot off the claws after having emptied and 
picked the birds ; make a hole below the joint 



235 

of the leg ; truss the leg inside of the body i 
tinge the birds till the flesh gets firm ; pinch the 
breast with year left hand, scotlop the breasts 
without quite reaching the skin, turn the flesh 
over on the table, beat the bird fl|it, dust it with 
a little salt and pepper ; then dip it twice into 
melted butter and crumbs of bread, then broil 
it, and send it up with an Ittdienne. 

N? 6. — Young Partridges h la Givry. 

In this case you add a decoration to the birds, 
in the following manner, truss and stew them as 
in N? 1* At dinner time take rings of white 
onions, let them be stewed white in a little 
tonsommij then take a cutter of the same size as 
the inside of the rings of the onions, cut round 
pieces of truflles that have been braized with the 
birds ; mind the truffles must be of a very black 
colour : (the parures are to be chopped and mixed 
with the Italienne:) the round pieces of truffles 
are to be put over the breasts of the birds, 
three on each side, and the rings of onions 
round the trafBes, and one over the pouch. 
If the truffles d^ not stick well use a little glace 
to make them stick, as they are liable to fall oflT. 
Jk> not ma^k with the sauce, which must be 
poured into the bottom of the dish ; the sauce 
must be an Italienne au tmffe, mix with % 
little glace of game. 



f36 

N? J.-^Compotte of ycmng Partridges h hhfw. 
Take four young partridges^ cut off the clawB^ 
and truss them en pouk, by which is meant 
with the legs inwards ; next singe them. Then 
take a few pieces of bacon from the breast^ 
which cut into small corks^ and boil in water for 
half an hour. You next fry them white^ and 
take them off from the fire as soon as they are 
made firm. Now fry your partridges, white also^ 
in butter and the fat of your bacon. When they 
are quite firm, take them out of the stew-pan. 
You then throw a spoonful of flour into the 
butter, and fry your flour white. Next pour in 
a little broth till the sauce be thin enough to 
be skimmed, (for it is to be observed that if a 
sauce be too thick it can never be skimmed) then 
put in some parures of mushrooms, a bunch of 
parsley and green onions, and season with a 
little thyme, bay-leaves, a clove, a little salt 
and a small lump of sugar. Stew the birds in 
this saucCi the same as a fricassie of chickens ; 
if onions be agreeable put a few small ones 
to give a relish. When the compotte is done> 
skim all the grease, drain the partridges in a 
clean stew-pan ; drain all the bacon, which you 
throw into the stew-pan with the partridges; 
reduce the sauce after it has been skimmed; 
drain it through a tammy over the birds^ put 



237 

the stew-pan au hain marie: now take some 
small white onions of an equal sise^ which have 
been boiling in a little consammi with a lamp of 
sugar ; you likewise hare some mushrooms, fried 
white in butter; when the onions and mush* 
l*ooms are ready, set the campotte boiling ; thicken 
the sauce with the yolks of four eggs beat with 
a little cream and lemon-juice ; next put in small 
onions, mushrooms, and bacon^ likewise some 
quenelles if you think proper, and garnish your 
entree. If the dish be a large size pot a crouton 
en critey glazed between each bird, and send up 
with a good seasoning. 

N? %.-^Compotte of young Partridges h hrun. 

Do exactly the same thing as in N? 7^ instead 
of moistening with consommSy use blond de veau^ 
(See Sauces.) Sweat the onions in a little butler 
till they be of a fine brown, then let them boil 
in a little hUmd de veau, they may be of an 
equal size, give them a good colour. Add 
truffles and mushrooms, in case you have any. 

N? 9. — Partridges aux Choux dressds. 

Takb a couple of old partridges, empty and 
truss them en jHmle, the legs inward ; simmer 
them on the fire till they get firm. Blanch 
eight cabbages, that you have cut by halvies; 



S38 

when the cf&bbages ard blanched^ put tliem 
into cold water to cool, cut off the tops o^ 
the middle^ * squeeze them so as to leave no 
water ; you have also blanched about a pound 
and a half of breast of bacon with the cabbage ; 
put this baoon into a small braizing-pan and the 
birds close to the bacon. Next put in the cab* 
bage, a few carrots tourn^es^ two or three 
onions, a bunch of parsley seasoned with salt 
and a small quantity of all-spice, bay-leave&r, 
and thyme ; cover the whole with a few layers 
of bacon, then with a sheet of buttered paper ; 
then moisten with a braize, if you have any, if 
• not, take some o£ the pot-top, but in the latter 
case you must season a little more. Set the 
contents of the braizing-pan boiling, and this 
being accomplished, put it over a slow fire for, 
three hours and a half. Now take out the layers 
of bacon, the onions, and the carrots. Place a 
large sieve over a dish of the same magnitude, 
turn the birds into the sieve, take a clean toweL 
mould the cabbage into a lai^e roller, squeeze 
them so as to have no grease left, then take a 
plain mould, garnish them with w^ry thin layers 
of bacon, make a kind of fiower, in the middle 
of the mould, with the crrots, put a border of 
sma 1 g!azcd onions all round the top ; next 
take some of the cabbage with a ladle, with 



230 

which 611 the mould. At the same tiide 1^ the 
birds' be covered all over with the cabbage 
equally on all sides. Make a rosasfe of carrots 
OD each face of the mould, which fill to the 
brim* Then put it in the oven. At dinner 
time turn the mould into a dish, let the birds, 
&c. lay for a moment, drain all the broth, and 
send up with a nice Espagnole.

N? 10. — Sautd of Fillets of young Partridges 

au fumet. > 

Take four young partridges, rather stale, that 
they may have more flavour, flay them, take up 
the fillets, detach the f lets mignans from the 
upper fillets, cut out the nerve of the Jilets 
ptignovs, and flatten the fillets with the handle of 
your knife dipped in cold water, the blade where- 
of is to be dipped in the same, pass it gently 
over the fillets leaning heavy on the table, in 
order to take oflf the second skin of the fillets 
only: trim the fillets nicely, mark them with 
clarified butter in a saut^ pan; lay the ^filets, 
mignons over the others, dust a little salt, and 
cover the whole with a round j)iece of paper till 
dinner time, then you sautez the fillets over a 
a very brisk and equal fire. With the remnants 
of the birds, mark a few thin slices of veal and 
ham in a small slew pan, lay the aforesaid 



240 

femriants of the birds over the veal, moisteh the 
• whole with a few spoonful of cansamm^. Let the 
whole sweat on a slow fire^ and when jowt 
' meat is sweated thoroughly, maisten with boil- 
ing conmnmiy to which add a few mushrooms^ 
if you have any, together with a bunch of parsley 
and green onions. Let the whole stew for an 
hour and a half; drain yoxxr funtet through a 
silk sieve, and reduce it to glaze, to use it when 
required. When the fillets have been sauids verd 
cuits, drain the butter; then take four or five 
spoonfbls of vehtU^f some of the above giace de 
giineTj and keep stirring without allowing them 
to boil* Now taste whether they are seasoned 
enough : pour a little thick cream to whiten the 
sauce and make it more mellow : have as many 
slices of bread cut in the shape of your fillets, 
fried in butter, as you have lai^ fillets, glaze 
the fried bread lightly, then dish the sauU in 
the following manner: a crvutan and next a 
Urge fillet with the thick end upwards, then a 
^let mignon with the point upwards, then

h la Sefton. 

Takb five young partridges, as tender as 
possible, and of an equal size, flay them, take 
up the fillets, and tear off the second skin. Next 
slit the fillets at tbree equal distances: have 
r^dy some trufiles that are chamfered and cut 
qui in the shape of a cork ; these you flatten on 
one side in order that when you slice the trufl3es^ 



342 

they may appear somewhat more than semi- 
circular ; take about eight of these slices of 
truffles^ lay them equally over one another and 
introduce some into each of the slits you have 
made^ and next into the other two parts : take 
care not to make the slits too deep, do the same 
with regard to every one of the ten fillets. The 
filets mignons are only to be marked in clarified 
butter ; do not forget piilling off the nerve, to 
prevent the fillets taking a bad shape whilst 
sauterifig. Mark the fillets in ti'saut^ pan with 
butter and round slices of truffles of an equal 
size, and sautez the fillets when dinner time is 
at hand.' With regard to the sauce (see Sauces h 
la bicullus) ; next drain the butter^ put the round 
truffles in one half on the sauce, and keep the 
other half to lay over the fillets. Make a kind 
of a coronet with the large fillets, and ^ish the 
^fikts mignons in the middle, standing nearly 
upright, by which is meant that you are to lean 
upon each intermediate one. This enir^e has a 
fine appearance when dished properly.

RABBITS. 



N? 1 .-—Fillets of young Rabbits h la OrKe^ 

It is to be observed that warren rabbits alone 
ought to be sent up to a good table^ tame rabbits 
in general having no savour. 

Take four rabbits ; detach the fillets, and 
^lets mignons : cut the large fillets of an equal 
size: marinate them in lemon-juice, a little 
parsley, a shalot cut into slices, a little thyme, 
a bay^leaf, salt, pepper, &c. &c. for two hours. 
X)rain them, dip them into the white of an e^ 
that has been well beaten, and then into some 
flour mixed with crumbs of bread. Fry them 
till it be of a fine brown, and serve under them 
a poivrade, or an Espagpole de gibier, observe 
particularly those fillets must be green done. 

N? 2.—^Turban of Fillets of Rabbits h la Sal- 

tane. 

Take the fillets. of four rabbits, which pro- 
duces eight fillets, likewise the flets mignons 



349 

aad kidneys ; ^ krd the eight fillets with very 
Boiall slips c^ bacon all of an equal size. Have 
^ farce h quenelles ready made out of the legs ci 
the rabbits* It vrould be requisite to have a kind 
of a cnupe pdte very high> or swtetmeat pot to 
be put in the middle of the dish^ in order ta 
raise the turban all around it ; in this ca&e the 
grease might be more easily drained, which is 
always in great abundaace if you place not a 
mould in the centre of the dish« Take a largt 
piece of stale breads cover it with a thin layer 
of bacon, lay it in the middle of the dish, and 
dress the farce h quenelles equally round on it : 
then with the handle of a wooden spoon mark 
leight ribs, leaving an interval between each not 
straight but rather sloping ; put the fillets ci 
rabbits inside each of those ribs ; and after having 
skinned the kidneys put them into four of the 
intervals two by two, in the other four you put 
fillets of trufiles* 

Mind to turn the pointed extremity of the 
fillets inside of the turban, otherwise they would 
pot stick. Cover the whole with layers of bacon. 
If you have an earthen-pan that may cover the 
whole hermetically, lay it over without using the 
layers of bacon. The steam alone will prevent 
the fillets from getting dry. When the turban 
has t)een kept in the oven long enough to be well 



250 

haked^ you glaze the fillets of a light brown, 
take the lump of bread out from the middle of 
the dish^ and wipe off all the grease. When 
going to send up put an eminci of rabbits in the 
middle, of the dish^ and sauce t-he outside with 
•very good fume of rabbit* 

N? 3* — Emincdof Rabbits au fumei. 

This is an entree de desserte. Take the fillets

Take five rabbits ; detach the fillets, tear off 
the nerves, then scollop the fillets keeping your 
knife in a slope ; flatten with the handle of the 
knife ; put the escalope in a sauti pan with s(>me 
clarified butter: have some truffles peeled an4

the truffles may give a relish to the sauce^ like- 
wise to the meat. Garnish the edges of the

N? j5. — Blanquette of Rabbits aux Pois. 

Take four rabbits, detach the fillets, sautez 
them entire in clarified butter with a little salt 
and pepper ; next cut them on a sheet of paper, 
of the size of a shilling, and put them into the

made as follows. With the remnants of the 
rabbits you make a consommi ; put a large slice 
of Westmoreland ham in a small stew-pan,* with 
some pieces of veal and the bones, &c. put the 
rabbits over them ; then moisten with two spoon- 
fuls of rich broth. Let the meat sweat thorough- 
ly, till, when you thrust your knife into it.

neither tcnm nor juice will issiie. Toii theii fill 
the slew-pan with boiling broth, well seasoned 
with a bunch o( parsley, green onions, ^thynie>. 
I)ay»]eaves, and a £ew mushrooms. When the 
eonsommi is done enough, put a small lump of 
butter into the stew-pan on the fire, and as soon 
as the butter is melted, throw in a spoonful of 
flour; let the flour fry a little in the butter^ 
without however getting brown. Next moisten 
with the consommi. Then throw in a bunch of 
parsley and green onions and few mushroom's. 
Let this sauce boil gently on the oomer of the 
stove for an hour. Skim the grease off carefully, 
then reduce the sauce, and thicken it with the 
yolks of three eggs well beaten with some cream. 
Drain this sauce through a tammy over the esco-

N? 8. — Young Rabbits en friteau. 

Take several very young rabbits ; skin them 
and cut them in four according to the size ; let 
thedi be marinated as in N? 1 of this chapter^ 
Drain them, and dip them into flour ; then fry 
them till of a light brown. Serve up with a

N? 9. — Rabbits h la Vinitienne* 

Take three young rabbits; skin and empty 

them nicely, then cut them into pieces in the

stir the sauce well: if it happened to be too 
thick) make it thinner with a spoonful of broth i 
keep it quite hot, throw the members into the 
sauce again, and send up quite hot. This sauce 
must be rather high seasoned*

MakB cases of paper either square or round } 
dip the rabbits as above into sweet herbd ; when 
nearly done put them into the paper cases akid 
the sweet herbs over them, with the rasped 
crust of a two*penny French loaf, to absorb the 
fat, or grease. Then put the paper cases into 
an oven. Before you send up squeeze a little 
lemon-juice, and pour in a few spoonfuls of 
Espagnole. 

N? II. ^Giblottes of Rahbits. 

Take two rabbits : it matters very little whe« 
ther they be young or not, to make a gibloUe* 
Skin them, and cut them into pieces as above^ 
Have ready some pieces of breast of bacon cut 
into the shape of small corks, which are blanehedi 
in order that they may no longer be . briny «

Next fry them in the stew-pan with a little but-* 
ter, to give them a light brown colour. Take 
the bacon out from the stew-pan wherein put 
the members of the rabbits ; when made firm 
you take them out also; throw a good handful 
of flour with the butter in the stew-pan, let it 
get a little brown ; next moisten with some 
blond de veau. Let the sauce boil a little to see 
whether it be not too thick : if so, you will 
never be able to skim the grease off, and accord- 
ingly it will never be of a good colour. When 
sufficiently stewed you put in the members, 
bacon, bunch of parsley and green onions, 
thyme, bay-leaf, clove^ &c* &c. ; and when the 
sauce has boiled for an hour you put the roera^ 
bers into another clean stew-pan, and drain ^he 
sauce through a tammy^ you then take some 
mushrooms toumiesy and some small onions 
which fry white in butter, let them boil for a 
quarter of an hour in the sauce. When you are 
going to send up dish first the members, next 
the small white onions, the bacon and the 
mushrooms. Skim the fat off and scum, other- 
wise there can be no good cookery.

is meant to dust floqr equally on all sides) yott 
let the whole stew for about an hour« N^xt 
take off all the scum and grease : shift the mem* 
bcrs into another clean stew-pan ; reduce the 
sauce, drain it through a tammy over the mem-* 
bers^ lay the giblatte on the fire, and when it 
boits^ thicken it with the yolks of four eggs, 
and the juice of a lemon. This sauce although 
white must be high seasoned. Note, if you want 
to make your giblotte whiter, you disgoi^ the 
rabbit and blanch them. 

N? 13. — Fillets of young Rabbits en lorgnettes. 

Take the fillets of four young rabbits that hi|ve 
been flayed ; lard them with thin bits of bacon ; 
when thus larded make an opening on the thick-* 
est part by thrusting your knife nearly to the 
▼ery extremity. Then run the knife in^ but no 
farther than the middle i and so on with the rest. 
Put a little butter in a sautS pan ; thrust your 
finger into the opening you have made; give 
those parts the shape of a lorgnette, put them 
for a moment in an oven that they may take a 
good form. When made firm, mark thcfii in 
a stew-pan, over a bed of minced roots and vege- 
tables, covered with bacon, seasoned with salt, 
pepper, thyme, bay-leaves, &c. &c. moisten 
with two spoonfuls of consomm^. Let the whole

9tew for a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes^ 
drain the fillets, reduce the liquor, to which 
add a little glaze of a light colour, and send up 
with endives au velout^, or a souhise. (See 
Sauces.) Dish en mirotoriy and pour the sauce 
in the middle. Mind the sauce be not too 
liquid. 

N? \4.~Pdle chaud of Rabbits. 

Take on or two rabbits, according to the size 
you wish to make the pdt^ of. Skin and empty 
them ; then detach the legs and shoulders ; which 
you cut by halves : from the head to the tail cut 
out four pieces of an equal size: then chop a 
shalot, a little parsley, and a few mushrooms 
and stew them : next put the members in the 
butter with the sweet herbs, till the flesh is quite 
firm, then season with salt, pepper, and spices* 
In the course of a few minutes, drain the butter. 
Then make a paste (see Pastry) and put the 
limbs into the oven. When the crust is baked 
enough, make a round opening, lifl up this 
kind of cover, and j-ust as you are going to send 
up, pour into the pye a ragadt h la Jtuandh^e. 
(See Sauces.) Be. careful to drain the grease

N? l&.^Quenelles of Rabbits. 

This farce is made like the generality of 
quenelles: the only difierence is that yx)u take 
the flesh of rabbits instead of any other meat. 
The l^s in general are used for making the 
quenelles ; the fillets will supply you with ano* 
Iher entrSe ; so will the legs occasionally. The 
bones and the parures are used to make tha 
oonsommS. 

N? l6.--Gratin of Rabbits. 

This^ is an entree de desserte ; take a couple 
of roasted rabbits ; lift up the whole fleshy parts; 
then parez those that have nerves about them ; 
mince the meat very flne^ and put this ^mincS 
into a veloutS reduced : take a little of the 
liquor which graiinex (by gratini is meant to 
stick at the bottom in a silver dish without burn* 
ing). When the preparatioi^ is cold^ stick a 
border of soft bread all round the inside of 
the dishj and put your 4nwnci in the middle :• 
level it well with a knife : then powder crumbs 
6f bread over it>. wliich baste with Kieked but-

baste with butter again. 1 ben make it brown 
all over with a salamander^ because if you were 
to put the dish in an oven hot enough to give it 
a colouring, the gratin then would buru. Kee|i 
It hot^ and send it up either with slices of bread

roll it into two boudins of the same length as 
your dish. Poach them in water with a little 
salt, when done, drain them on a clean cloth)

of those legs, or even a little larger. Then take 
small layers of bacon, lay one on the paper, and 
the leg over the bacon, then a little seasoning, 
and another layer of bacon ; wrap the whole in 
the paper, which is to be plaited equally all 
round. Then broil them over a slow fire, and 
send up hot, without any sauce. 

N? 22. — Hissoles of Rabbits* 

Take the remnants of roasted rabbits, with 
which make a farce fine. (See farce fine.) 
Spread on the table some feuilletagey but do 
not let it be too rich ; cover it, at equal dis- 
tances, with little lumps of yjirce; moisten the 
past all lound, then fold it in two ; lean upon it 
all round with your fingers, that the paste may 
stick ; then with a rowel cut it and let it fry tiM 
it be of a fine brown. You may occasionally 
ppwder them over with crumbs of bread, when

Make boudins of rabbits with quenelles of the 
same length as the dish ; poach them in milk, 
butter, and a little salt. When none enough 
drain them on a clean towel. Cut one side flat till 
they dish well ; have a little veloutS reduced and 
pretty thick, which whiten with a little thick 
cream. Mask the boudins with this sauce, but 
do not use more than is requisite for masking 
the boudinsy since in the middle you are to 
serve a ragoAt h VAUemandCy which is the same 
thing as a Toulouse. You must have six fillets 
larded equally. Take a. very large carrot, cover 
it with thin layers of bacon, and lay the fillets 
over the carrot with a little salt : let them stand 
a moment in the oven till they be firm : you 
then glaze and dry them with the salamander: 
now glaze them a second time : then lay one 
fillet at each extremity of the boudin, and one 
fillet in the middle. Mind to keep this entree 
well covered, for if not, it would not be of i^ 
fine colour, and the velouti would dry up.

not catch the ^ye^ as the phrase goes. In the 
common way many entries may be made with 
the legs of rabbits^ but as many dishes of game 
are not to be sent up at a *time, provided you 
have fillets^ it is better to use the legs for Jarces^ 
QT petty pattiesi or croquettes.

HARES AND LEVERETS. 



It IB Y^PI^' to observe^ that the hares are fit 
W W^ sett tfp to a nobleman's table^ when they* 
atkB «hevr their age. To be made acquainted 
whether they be hold or youngs feel the first 
jJMit of the fore claw : if yoa fifid a imall nodusi, 
tie anitnal k still yMng: should this noi»» 
littve disappeared^ turn the claw sideways, andl 
if tbt joint crack, this is a sign of its being 
tfeilt ltod« ; if oOt it is only fit to be made 
€» daube, or en civet : but if very taugb a tkuibt. 
is preferable ; yet it is a very insignificant disb^ 
the more so as requiring high seasoning, it is too 
nourishing to be sent up to a nobleman's table^ 
or that of any real epicure. 

N? 1 • — Hare en Dauhe. 

Aftek having skinned, emptied and washed 
eff the blood of a hare, you divide it through the 



267 

middle. Have ready layers of bacon well sea^* 
Boned with chopped parsley, spiced, gait and 
pepper. Lard the hare as thick a^ possible ; put 
slices of bacon in the bottom of a stew-pan, 

9 

covet them with slices of hare, tie up a large 
bundle of parsley, seasoned with thym^ bay- 
leaves, sweet hazily a clove and common spicea 
a few carrots, four large white onions, two cair^ 
feet, and a few pieces of breast of bacon ; seasont 
the whole with salt, pepper, &c. and a few roota 
of parsley. Moisten with a couple of spoonfuls 
of rich broth, a pint of white wine ; cover the 
whole with a, round of buttered paper, to pre-: 
vent the hare getting dry ; now oover it hermetH 
cally, and let it stew for three hours as gently as 
possible : then take it off from the fire ; draifK 
the hare ; skim the liquor, drain it throi:^h a 
silk sieve, and let it cool, that it may iMs tetea 
cold ; although you may serve it hot, with a. 
garnish all round. In this latter case you make, 
a roux with a little flour and butter; wheti of ^ 
very light colour, moisten it with the Iteiuor m 
which the hare has been stewed, and let it boil 
enough fir the flour to be done, and then setid 
np^ plain as it is. 

N. B. — If you wi^h the jelly should look 
bright, break a couple of eggs into the jelly 
vhilst not boti beat it over th& fire till it b^ina. 



268 

boiling, then lay it aside with a cover and a 
little fire over it ; when limpid drain it through 
a cloth, and let it cool, to be used occasionally. 

N? 2. — Gvet of Hare, served as Terrine. 

SKiKand empty the hare, but take care not 
to waste the blood. First cut off the two legs, 
next divide them into two or three pieces ; cut 

m 

likewise' the body into equal pieces ; be particu« 
lar in preserving the blood in a vessel, to be 
used as follows. Take half a pound of breast of 
pork, otherwise called petit lard, cut it into 
small square pieces about an inch thick, blanch 
these in water, then put them into the stew-pan, 
with a small lump of butter ; let them fry till 
they be of a fine brown ; take out the bacon, 
and put the pieces of. hare into the stew-pan, 
(of all things pull out the eyes) stew them in the 
butter till firm ; then take them out and make a 
rotur, which is not to be kept too long on the 
fire. Moisten with about a quart of broth and 
a pint of red wine ; put in the pieces of hare, 
die bacon, a bunch of parsley, &c. with pepper, 
salt, and spices, and a few white onions, to give 
a relish, together with some parures of mush- 
rooms. Let the whole boil for an hour and try 
whether the pieces of hare be done. Skim the 
grease oflf from the sauce ; then put the mem« 



269 

bers in a clean stew.pan, one after another, 
likewise the bacon and nothing else. You must 
have ready some white onions ^ried in butter, 
till they be of a light brown ; those you stew in 
a little consomm^j or hlond de veau. Have like- 
wise some mush rooms stewed in butter. Let 
the sauce boil gently, yet it must get thick. 
Now the blood and liver, that have been left in 
a vessel are to be poured into the sauce as thick- 
ening. You must not letthe sauce boil, other- 
wise the blood would in some measure curdle, 
neither would the sauce be of the same dark 
brown colour. Civet must appear as black as 
possible : then put in the onions and mush* 
rooms, and send up high seasoned. 

N? 3. — Fillets of Hare, au Sang. 

When a hare has been skinned, thrust your 
knife all along the spine, taking care ever to 
lean towards the bone. Detach with your fin* 
gers, the fillet down from the neck to the legs ; 
leave the thick fleshy part after the leg ; then 
introduce your knife, the sharp side towards the 
tender part of the fillet and your thumb towards 
the skin ; press with your thumb on the sharp 
side of the blade of the knife, in order that it 
may not cut the part affected with the nerves. 
You then pull towards you the fillet, and the 



270 

lierve rtmaint attached to the leg* l^is operas 
tioQ being performed, you scollop the fillets, 
that is to say, you lay the fillets on the table, 
and flatten them with the back of your knife, 
then slope your knife, eut off slices nearly fiat ; 
•larft them in a^ate^<fpan with clarified butter, 
and dust a little salt and pepper over them. At 
dinner time sautez the escalopes^ drain the 
butter, and put the fillets into a sauce de ctvet, 
which you have made with the remnants, as it 
will require at least a oouple of hares to make 
escalopes au sang. Mind to preserve the blood 
ef both, in order that the sauce may be black, 
or of a dark brown. The meipbers may serve 
for a terrine ; but are not worth eating for the 
parlour, but are good for the servants. 

N? A^^-Fillets (^ Hare en ChevreuiL 

' Take the fillets of three or four bares, accord- 
ing to the size of your dish, detach the fillets, 
and lard them with bacon cut very equal ; then 
put them into a deep vessel : with salt and 
pepper, a little parsley, two onions cut into 
slices, a bay-leaf, a little thyme, a glass of vine- 
gar and half a glass of water. Let these be mari- 
nated for a couple of days ; you then drain the 
fillets and mark them in a sauti pan with a little 
butter : bake them next verd cuits : glaze tbena

roasted Hares. 

I SHALL only observe that houdifis, guenellesy 
imincisy &c» may be made oi harcs^ although 
in England it ia most customary to serve them 
roasted. They nevertheless are very good when 
made into pieces. Roasted hares ought always 
to be tender. In England after being skinned, 
they are not shewn to the fire a little^ as in 
France, to be made firm. They make a farce 
in the following manner. They take a good 
handful of cruinb of hreadj with (he same quan« 
tity of beef-suet well chopped^ a little chopped 
parsley, a little thyme, salt, pepper, two eggs, a 
little butter, and a little milk. They mix thesi 
tip in an oval shape, with whi<^ they stuff the 
beHy of the hare, and sew up the belly. They 
stick the fore legs under the belly, and double 
the hind legs under the belly also, then skewer 
them well ; the head stands erect as if the hare 
was running, and thoy flay the ears. If it foe 
an old hare it will require an hour doing, if 
young three-quarters of an hour will do. Serve 
k up with gravy, and some currant-jelly in a 
tauce-boat; Some people like a powrade under it.

Entries of red legged Partridges ^ or Bartavelks. 
These sort of partridges are very scarce in 
England : yet let those who chancie to meet with 
some^ cook them in the same manner as the 
other partridges. 

Quails and Cailleteaux. 

The cailleteaux are young quails, but owing 
to their enormous price in England, they are 
very seldom, if ever, to be procured at the 
poulterers. An entree of fillets of young quails, 
besides its costing too dear, is never attempted ; 
the expence would come to an extravagant price, 
without any other merit. 

N? l.—Compotte of Quails. 

' Take six or eight quails according to the size 
of your dish. Cut the claws off, empty the birds 
without making too large an opening. Truss 
them en paule, that is to $ay, with the legs 
inward. Have a dozen pieces of bacon cut in 
the shape of a cork, blanch them in order to 
draw the salt out: then let them stew in the 
butter till they be of a light brown ; then take 
them out of the stew-pan to make room for the 
quails, which stew till they begin to be of a 
light brown also,' and then take them out. Make 
a rotM^ which moisten with a little blond de 




273 

beau, add a bunch of parsley and green oniotis^ 
some small white onions (if approved of) mush- 
rooms, &c. As soon as the quails are done^ 
take them out of the stew-pan, and let the bacon 
stew till thoroughly done. Skim the saure well, 
and drJEiin it through a tammy over the quails : 
then dish the bacon, mushrooms, and smaill 
onions, and send up quite hot, and well sea* 
soned. 

*  

Nt' 2. — Compotte of Quails k blanc» 

This is made in the same manner as the com- 
potte of partndt^es, N? 8, with the only difference 
that you use broth instead of blond de veau; 
thicken the sauce, or serve the onions a blanc, 
the same as the mushrooms* 

N? 3 .-^Quails aux Pol^. 

EM^^Y, singe, and truss six nice quails \ 
mark them in a stew-pan wrapped up with layers 
of bacon : moisten with a pocle if you have any, 
if not with two spoonfuls of broth, a bunch of 
p<«rsley, &c. now season them well. Stew them 
for twenty minutes over a very slow fire. Drain 
them well and let them boil for a moment with 
the pals au hhl. ^See Sauces pois a brun^ 
pois h blanc.) Next dish them^ and reduce ths

N? ^.-^QuaHs itn grutin. 

Bone six quaiU^ pick thepi. nicely : take a 
Yiitle Jar cejine, made in preference of the fl^sh 
pf youqg rabbits : fill the bodies of the quails 
with ^he md farce: then r^ise a kind of a 
dome on a dish^ and with a spoon make room, 
for the birds : next make an opening 'n the 
middle ; }^ it be either round or square accord- 
ing to the shape of the dish. Put a piece of aoft 
bread ?ovei;ed with layers of bacon wltbjn the. 
opening;, cover the birds wijlji layers of ba<^n, 
and put the dish into the oven for about; a qu^^rtei; 
of an hour^ or twenty minutes at mpst^ tijl th^- 
birds be done. Drain the grease carefully. Then 
take six slices of br^ad. cut^ in the shape of 
co?kVcombs, which you fry in butter till . tijey 
be of a. light bfown, and put theni one lyr on» 
between the birds. Serve a rq^oiii h ^Jina^r

l^i^hca the stew-pan is to be put au bain marie^ 
that the birds may taste of the sauce and truffles. 

N? G^-^-^tuaih h la Crapcrudine. 

These are dressed and cooked in the same 
manner as ihe pigeons, or partridges a la cra^ 
paudine. Serve them up with an Jfalienney or 
a con^ommi a glace over them. 

l^o6dcochs aivd Snipes. 

WoodcockjS, the same as snipes> axe good 
only when they are fat. They are cooked but 
in Very jEew waye>. Tlw mo^ dolicftte p«rts are 
the legs and the- inte3tine9. The fillets of wood- 
cooks, for those who do not like their meat verd 
cuit, are tough and without savour. They are 
held in high estimation when roasted or en safmu 
A pwr^c of woodcocks is also served occasional ly» 
They may however be dressed in as many ways 
iaryoQng partrrdges% When roasted, you must 
ialways pql a toast under them, to receive the 
intestines which generally drop off whilst roast* 
ing, unless paper be used to secure them. Take 
care to stop the f^t wh^n the baick is towards 
^be fire^ because the legs are to be well done, 
nod the fillets wrds cuits.

N ? 1 . — Salmi of fFoodcochs. 
Thb same operation is required as for the 
salmi of partridges. Instead of boiling the 
parures in the sauce, take out the members, as 
you do in the salmi of partridges, and peund the 
remainder in a mortar till you can strain it 
through a tammy. When you have skimmed 
the grease ofFi and given a good seasoning, 
moisten the pounded meat with that sauce ; then , 
strain it through a tammy, put it over the legs 
in a bain marie. The salmi must be made 
hot, but without boiling. Serve up with slices 
of fried breisid cut into hearts and glazed. 

N? 2. — Salm of Woodcocks h FEspagnole* 

If you have any roasted woodcocks left, cut 
them as for eating ; mark the members in a stew- 
pan; make a sauce as for partridges: put the 
parures into the sauce boiled for an hour : when 
the sauce has been well skimmed, and that there 
is no grease left, drain it through a tammy over ' 

the members. Let it be made hot without boil- 
ing, and serve up with slices of fried bread be- 
tween the members. 

N? 3. — Croustadede purieof Woodcocks. 

If you have any ^(i/mt of woodcocks left, drain 
all the sauce^ mince the flesh well and pound \Xr 



277 

in a mortar; then moisten it with the sauce^ 
and warm it to know whether the pur^e be too 
thin or too thick : drain it then through a 
tammy, and put it au bain marie; then work it 
with a small lump of very fresh butter. Cut 
eight slices of bread into hearts all of an equal 
size : try them on the dish to see whether they 
form a regular flower ; then cut another slice 
quite round to pul in the middle over the points 
of the hearts: this completed, make a deep 
incision all round the upper part, without how- 
ever it being cut through : then fry them in 
clarified butter till of a light brown : as soon as 
they are fried cut the middle out, to leave as 
little crumb as possible. Keep' them hot, well 
wrapt up in a clean sheet of paper. When ready 
to serve up, work the puree, and pour it into 
the croustade. 

You^ may send up this pur^e in a lord de 
plat with poached eggs, or in a vol au vent, &c, 

N? \.—Phver^. 

Plovers are hardly fit but to be roasted. 
Sometimes however they are prepared a la hofur- 
guignotte^ which is indeed the only way of mak- 
ing a ragoiit of plovers. In this latter case 
empty and truss them as neatly as possible; 
mark them in a stew-pan with layers of bacon ;

the members with the sauce. 



Ther*: ape pigeons of various sorts ; nameljr^ 
tame pigeons, wild pigeons, and wood pigeons. 
The former are most in use, ^ although wild 
pigeons be good either broiled or roasted ; but 
if made ragadts or fricassis of, their flesh is 
too black. Small pigeons h la gautier are of 
great service for garnishing, hut they make very

possible. Now broil the pigeons on a slow fire 
that they may get thoroughly done without 
l)eing burnt, You ascertain when they are done 
enough by thrusting the point of your knife into 
the fleshy part of the leg. If no blood issues, 
then they are done enough. Serve under them 
an Italienne^ or some rich gravy. This being

N? 4. — Pigeons au Soleil. 

These indeed are not well named as they 
shine but very Httle. It is an entree de desserte^ 
and that is saying enough. If you have any 
pigeons either roasted or otherwise left, cut off 
the pigeons in two. You next put them in a 
marinade. (See N? 39, Entries of Fowl.) 
When they have simmered for half an hour in 
the marinade, let them cool, drain them, and 
put them into a pdte a frire. (See pdte h

As I do not pretend to make a shew of extra-

it la sauce aux tomaiesj en marinade au blanc,

every one has his choice. 

For la godardj or la chamhordy likewise for

This dish would find few admirers, as birdi

seldom called for. The nobility of this country 
like to see what they are eating, lest they should 
ineet with something they do not like in a pdti*

reason why is obvious and justifies their aver- 
*^iori, as the aforesaid pdtSs chauds are generaliy^

Pheasants. 

It is no easy matter to meet with a pheasant 
that has that exquisite taste which is acquired 
only by long keeping. The damp of the climate 
prevents their being kef)t so long as they are in 
other countries. The hens in general are more 
delicate. The cocks shew their age by their 
spiers. They are ooly fit to be eat^ when the 
blood runs from the bill, which is commonly six 
flays or a week after they have been killed. You 
may then either roast, or make entries of them. 
The fiesh of a pheasant is white, tender, and has 
a good savour if you keep it long enough ; if npt, 
it has no more savour than a common fowl. 

N? 1 .—'Salmi of Pheasants h VEspagnole.

FRESH WATER FISH. 



CARPS. 

N? l.—Carp grilldey sauce aux Capres. 
You must never use fresh water fish unless it 
be alive^ and kill it yourself. When you have 
beaten a few strokes on the carp's head with a 
large knife, * you thrast your knife under the 
scales, beginnitig at the tail, and proceed cut- 
ting right and left. All the scales on one side 
must come 00* at once, in a piece. Then do the 
same on the other side, and about the belly. 
When the scales have been taken off properly, 
and that none are left, your carp must be white ; . 
you then take off the gills, without damaging the 
tongue, which is one of the most delicate parts 
of the carp« Make a small incision in the neck 
as if you were going to cut off the head ; make 
another in the b^lly, but in a contrary direction 
and as small as possible. Then with your fore^ 
finger draw out the roe, intestines, and guts. 
Wash your carp well, till th^r^ b? no blood left^ 

u 3 



39i 

You next wipe it well, and slit both sides of the 
back^ and let it marinate in a little oil, salt, and 
pepper for about an hour, or a little more. Now 
lay it on the gridiron over a very slow fire, that 
it may have time to be well done through. When 
broiled on both sides, serve it with. a sauce aux 
capres, and beurre d*anchois. (See Sauces.) If 
the carp had a soft roe, you return it inside of 
Jthe body with a little chopped parsley, mixed 
with a sm&U lump of fresh butter, salt, and 
pepper ; then sow the belly up for fear the con- 
tents jshould drop out. When your carp is done, 
cut off the thread, and mask the fish with the 
shuce* 

N? 2.— Carpe farcie aufour. 

Aft£r having cleansed and prepared a carp as 
above^ take up one half of it, and with the flesh 
make a farce (see farce de carpe) with which, 
you cover the other half, the bones whereof 
have been taken out. Give it a pleasing shape. 
Then with a very small spoon figure scales over 
it, and put it into the oven on a baking-pan. 
Take care it does not get too dry. When it is 
of a fine brown colour, you must cover it when 
it is done, which you ascertain by running your 
knife between the force and th^ fish. If youy 



,295 

carp is done you send it up to table witli a saucf 
aux anchoisy or an Italienne en gros. 

^N? 3.^-r-La Carpe au bku, et au court-bomlbnu 

Take a very fine carp^ cut oflf the gills^ but 
retain the tongue. Then make as small an 
ppening as possible to empty it, and wash- it 
well, till no blood be left. Then boil some 
^vinegar, and when boiling hot pour it over the 
fish that the scales may- crisp. You next wrap 
your carp up in a cloth^ and stew it in a cdurir 
bouillon. Let it cool in the court-bouiHon, in 
case you are to send it up cold. If it is intended 
to serve it up hot, then sauce it with a sauce au 
beurre tTanchois^ (See Sauces.) 

Court-bouillon. 

Take three carrots, four onions, six shalots^ 
and two roots of parsley, which pick and wash^ 
Chop them very fine. Put a small lump of butter 
into a stew-pen, with the above roots, and stew 
them till they begin to get brown. Moisten next 

with two bottles of red wine, a bottle of water.

If you should have no wine^ put m some vine- 
gar. The court^houillon is better after having 
s.erved several times than on the first day. It if 
a famous thing for stewing craw-6sh. 

N? 4. — Carpe h la ChanAcrd. 

Take a very hugQ carp, scale it and empty it 
as indicated in N? 1. Have the soft roes of 
other smalt carp^ which introduce into the 
body of the large one^ after you have seasoned 
them with chopped parsley, salt, pepper^ and 
spices. Sew up the belly of your carp, and lard 
two squares on the back with very small pieces 
of bacon. Next lay the carp in a fish-pan 
with one half of your court-houiUony and put it 
into the oven, but mind you baste it frequently 
with the marinade. When it is done, drain it, 
but take care you do not break it. Now dish it 
>vith la chambord {^ee Sauces) and its garnish. 

N? ^.^^Matelotte de Carpe ^ Iq Royalt. 

Take several carp, which cleanse as indi- 
cated N? 1. Then you cut them into thick 
slices. You first cut off the head^ but never 
forget to take out the stone which is at the top 
of the spine, exactly about the neck, for it tias 
a most obnoxious bitter tastq. Next cut thq 
remainder into three equal parts^ (^i^l^h JR

prance are called frontons)* Wash thes^ welU 
then lay them on a clean towel to drajn^ and 

jnark them in a stew-pan just large enough to 

•J 

contain the quantity of fish you \yish to cook. 
As you arc to boil the fish with wine only, if 
you were to take too large a vessel, it would 
require top much wine, which would be wasted* 
Powder a little salt oyer yoqr fish. Pour only 
as much wine as is requisite just to cover tb^ 
carp, and let it stew over a large fire. As soon 
as the w*ine boils, ifitbegood, or unadulterated, 
}t will catch fire. Red wipe of course is used* 
You then take your pan oflf from the fire, and 
leave it on the corner of the stove, and make a 
sauce in the following manner* 

Put a lump of butter into a stew-pan, accord-* 
jng to the quantity of fish you have. At any 
rate a quarter of a pound will be enough. Then 
make a roux by mixing a little flour. When 
your roux begins to get brown, put in two large 
onions cut by quarters, and let them fry till 
they be entirely melted. Then moisten with 
some of the wine in which your fi^h has been 
stewing ; add a large bunch of parsley and green 
onions seasoned with all-spice. Pick a pint of 
mushrooms, wash theni well, toumez the finest 
which you throw into a little water and lemon- 
juice to keep them white^ The varures are to 



298 

be used for the improvement of the, sauce, whicl) 
skim off, let no grease remain, then drain it 
through a tammy over your tron^ns. You 
must have ready some small onions fried brown 
in butter, and stewed separately in a little broth ; 
mushrooms likewise stewed separately. Then 
dish your trongons with the head in the middle. 
You have provided somfe soft roes which you 
have stewed also separately in vinegar, that they 
may be quite firm ; with these garnish your 
matefotte. Next you have a dozen of toasts 
made of rasped crust of bread, a few quenelles^ 
craw-tish the same, and you dish your mateiotte 
rather en dome. Let your sauce boil in a good 
lump of butter kneaded with a little flour, then 
z beurre of six anchovies, and the juice of a 
lemon. The sauce must be rather high sea* 
soned, and thick that it may jnask well. The 
small onions and mushrooms are not to be 
omitted. 

; N? 6. — Mateiotte de Carpe h h MarinUre. 

After havmg cleansed your fish as indicated 
N? 1, you put it into any vessel whatever that will 
stand a large brisk fire. Moisten with some red 
wine according to the quantity of the fish ; put 
some small onions fried whitfe in butter into 
your vessel, with salt, pepper, spices, ^ bunch 



of parsley and green onions well seasoned. Let 
the whole boil till you see the fish be done. 
You have been handling some butter and flour, 
which you drop by small parts into your sauce, 
in order to thicken it. You have likewise some

EELS. 

N? 1. — La Matehtte d^AngutUes. 

Take one or two live eels. Throw them into 
the fire. As they whirl on all sides you lay hold 
of them with a towel in your hand, and skin 
them from head to tail. This method is the 
best as it is the means of drawing out all the oil, 
whicn is unpalatable. Cut your eels into iron- 
govs, without ripping the belly ; then run your 
knife into the hollow part, and turn it round to 
take out the entrails. Wash them well, that no 
blood remain. MarJc your trongons in the like 
manner as those of c^rp. The eel is longer 
doing, yet the operation is the same. It will 



300 

frequently happen that a matelotte in made of alt 
sorts of fish^ such as carp^ tench, pike^ and 
eels. The carp is sooner done than any of the 
other mentioned fish, but they notwithstanding 
arc always cooked together when they can be 
procured* 

« 

N? 2, — Tron^ons d^AnguUles h la Tartare. 

Skin the eel as above^ cut your tran^ns 
longer, make a court-bauilion, or a marinade. 
Stew your tron^/ons in this marinade, and when 
they are done let them coo], then you brush 
them over first with yolks of eggs mixed with a 
little salt, and dip them into crumbs, then with 
butter, and strew over them crumbs of bread 
again. Broil them of a fine colour, or bake 
them, and serve them up with a sai^e hlari-' 
mouhde. (See Sauces.) 

N? Z.'^Tron^m d'AnguUles h la Pauletfe. 

There are some people who will cook Pan- 
^tiille a la poulette, in the same manner as a 
fricassee de poulets ; it is better however to stew 
it in a marinade, and then to make the sauce h 
la poulette, by taking some ^auce tournde, which* 
you reduce till it can take a thickening. Mix 
it with parsley chopped very fine, and small 
onions if approved of; but then they are to be 



301 

done separately and stewed in a little broth and 
salt. Drain them, and put them into the saucp 
after having thickened it. Let it be seasoned 
pretty high with salt, pepper, and the juice o^ 
a lemon. Let your eel continue in the sauce 
for ten minutes before you send your dinner up 
to table. If you should have no sauce tourn^e, 
make a little roux hlanc (see Sauces), moisten 
with either water or broth, to which add a 
bunch of parsley and green onions, pepper, salt, 
and a small white onion. W^en your sauce has 
been boiling for an hour, that the flour may be 
well done, you take out the parsley and onions^ 
skim your sauce, mix a little chopped parsley 
and the juice of a lemon with the thickening^ 
and serve up hot.

You must scale and empty your pike, then 
cut it into tron^tmsy and wash them well, till 
thore be no blood left. Mark in a stew-pan a 
lump of butter, some roots and stalks of parsley,, 
an onion cut into slices, a few minced carrots, 
half of a bay-leaf, a little thyme. Stew the 
whole over a slow fire, that the vegetables may 
be done without getting brown. Then moisten 
with ptiilk seasoned with salt, and let your roots 
stew. When yoar polonaise is done, drain it' 
through a sieve over your tron^ons^ which arc 
to be stewed in that moisture. When they are 
done, take some turnips cut into olives, which 



303 

stew also in the above seasoning. You next 
mark a haricot vierge (s^e Sauces) with the 
moisture^ and make a roux blanc (see Sauces) 
iiyith two ounces of bntter^ and two spoonfuls 
of flour. Moisten with your seasoning, and 
add to it a few mushrooms if you have any. 
Now reduce that sauce till it be thick enoitgh 
to mask the fish ; drain your turnips well to 
prevent their making your sauce liquid. Dish 
your 'troncans, put a little sugar in the sauce; 
taste it to ascertain whether it be properly sea- 
soned and send up to table as white a3 possible^

After' having merely emptied and washed 
your pike^ without scaling it, mark a marinade, 
with carrots, onibns, parsley roots, thyme, bay-

parsley.. Stew all these in a little butter over a 
slow fire. When your roots are become tender, 
moisten them with Madeira wine, and let your 
marinade stew on. When it is done enough^ 
drain it through a sieve over your pike, which 
you have taken care to lay in the straitest vessel 
you could procure, so as to use no more wine 
than is requisite for the sauce. Mind not to pu£ 
inuch salt, as the moistening is used for th^ 
lauce. When your pike isdone^ drain it imme-

diately that you may scrape off all th^ scales oit 
both sides. Then return it into the vessel 
ivhercin it has boiled, and pour in a Httle of th^ 
liquor to keep it warm, and from getting dry. 
Make a roux, but not too high in colour, which 
you moisten with the wine alone en matgre : but 
en gras you add two good spoonfuls of blond de 
veau (see Sauces) with some parures of mush*

Scale your pike, take off the gills, without

suet. {En maigre you use butter instead of 
suet.) The yolks of two eggs, or two whole 
eggs, put a little milk, a large quantity of 
chopped parsley, a little thyme, salt and pepper, 
and shalots chopped very fine if approved ofr 
Put the whole in the belly of your pike. Thea

trim a plqfmd with layers of bacon that tht 
pike may not bum and stick. Fasten the fish*s 
tail in its mouth with a little skewer. Break a 
few eggs in an earthen-pan, with a little pepper 
and salt. Now brush your pike all over with 
the beaten eggs^ and powder it over with crumbs 
of bread ; then baste it all over with melted 
butter^ and powder it with crumbs of bread 
again: baste it afresh with butter, and then 
bake it in the oven, till it be of a fine colour. 
Send it up to table on a cloth, and serve up 
separately la sauce Hollandotse. (See Sauces.) 
If you send up two pikes, let one be green, and

Perch is a fish that is held in high estiroatioa^ 
Its flesh is white and delicate; the perch is easily 
digested, and is particularly recommended ta 
those invalids who hare a weak debilitated 
stomach. 

N? \.— Perch a la JVaterfiah. 

Empty your perch. Wash them well in seve^

blanche, composed of shreds of parsley and of 
parsley roots, of a few carrots, two or three 
green onions cut into fillets. Stew the whole 
in a little butter. When your roots begin to 
get soft, moisten with boiling water, salt, pep- 
per, &c. Let the whole stew well, then pour 
that marinade over your fish, which stew for 
about twenty minutes. Then drain and scale it 
nicely, preserving, however, the red fins. When 
your perch is quite clean, stick those red fins 
into the partition of the fillet, to shew what the 
fish is. Do not forget to bind the head before 
you stew the percb^ as it is very liable to break%

This fish is held in high estimation in France^ 
and especially in Paris. It must be scaled, 
emptied, and washed nicely. Next it is to be 
marine in a little oil, with pepper and salt. It 
is proper that it should be slit, that the salt may 
penetrate. Broil it on both sides over a slow fire. 
It will be done in the course of half an hoar. 
When it is done, let it be served with a sauce

SALT WATER FISH- 



TURBOT. 

A TURBDT of a middling size is preferable te 
any other. When very large the meat is tou^ 
and thready. It was customary in France^ and 
the same must be done in every country, to 
empty the fish and to wash out all the blood; 
We besides made an eau de self by which must 
be understood that as we had no white salt, we 
used to boil some of our grey aalt in water, then 
let the water rest and strain it, next to lay the 
turbot over a sheet of paper in the fish-kettle. 
We used also to prick the white side of our 
turbot with a needle h brider, to prevent the 
skm firom breaking, and to facilitate the salt 
penetrating to the very bone. We likewise 
rubbed the surface with lemon, and would put 
a few slices of lemon into the water ; we then 
wrapt up the fish into buttered white paperj and 
Jet it stew^ without boiling. 



^18 

But in England a more expeditious metbod 
is practised^ and which^ in my opinion^ is pre- 
ferable: tbe fish preserves its natural savour^ 
and is more firm, the metbod is as foIlo\vs. 
Have some boiling water^ nrhereinto you put 
your fish after having rubbed it over with lemoa 
and salt. Throw into the water a large hand* 
ful of salt; cover your kettle, and let it boil half 
an hour, or three-quarters of an hour, according 
to the size of your turbot. Then drain it and 
Mnd it up to table on a clotb, with crisp gteen 
parsley as a garnish. The parsley is never eat^ 
Iwk the green colour improves the look of tbe 
fish. With regard to the cloth, it attracts the 
water from the fish, and of course makes it more 
susceptible of receiving the sauce. Lobster sauce 
ia a boat. (See Sauces*)

Some sorts offish require a little vinegar, salmon 
does not, it spoils its colour. DaUes atre done 
within a quarter of an hour. You put your fish 
into some boiling water, with plenty of salt. Let 
it boil very fast which makes it more firm. As 
soon as it is done, drain it, for if you were to leave 
it in the water it would lose both its savour and 
colour. If it is not time yet to send it up, leave

case it should not be thick enough to mask with, 
use a lump of butter kneaded with flour, and 
some butter and a heurre d*anchois (see Sauces) 
with the juice of a lemon. Drain your fish, and 
mask it with your sauce, after having drained it 
through a tammy.

to put the red part upward. When your houdins 
are equally decorated, lay them in a dish, which 
you cover, and lay them for a moment in the

them up with the juice of a lemon, and no 
other sauce. This is a very palatable dish^ but 
common* 

N? 8. — Merlans JHts. 

According to the French fashion we do not 
flay the whitings ; we only slit, and then fry 
them in very hot dripping, and serve them with- 
out any sauce. In England you take off the 
skin^ and fasten the tail in the mouth ; and dip 
them into an omelet te, then in a little flour and

Take some roots of parsley, which cut into 
slices as for ^julienne, about one line thick aod

one inbh long. Put these roots into some water 
with a burich of parsley, green onions, thyme, 
bay-leaf, and a little salt, and let them stew for 
an hour. Then stew your soles. When they 
are done, have ready some leaves of parsley, 
(without stalks) which have boiled separately in 
salt and water. Drain your soles, that the par- 
sley-roots, cut into slices above-mentioned may 
stick. You then put your soles into a tureen, 
or a deep dish, with some of the liquor in which 
they have been stewed, and which you drain 
through a silk sieve. Throw in the roots of 
parsley and the leaves, and send up your potage 
without any bread in it ; but in a separate plate, 
3end up a few slices of rye-bread and butter. Thi^

drain the whole through a tammy, in order that 
your sauce be thin. Add to it a little beurre

Keep your sauce hot, and mask your fillets.

Divide that butter into three equal parts, and 
put each inside of the opening of the soles, 
close the opening, and make the whole stick by 
means of the yolk of an egg, put a few crunftbs 
of bread at the joint. Then dip your soles into 
an omelette of two eggs, and next into crumbs 
of bread, equally on all sides. When dinner 
time is come^ fry your soles in hot dripping. 
They are done as soon as they have got a colour. 
The sauce is found in the sole itself. This la 
ivhat we call in France an entree bourgeoise. 

"N? 9. — Aspic et Salade de Filets de Sol/es; ' 

It is occasionally requisite to dress soles on 
purpose to make either aspics, or a sallad ; in 
which case it is better to fry therii with the skin, 
than to take up the fillets and to sautez them. 
When they are fried the fillets come off neater, 
and without any scum. If, however, you have 
sent up to table an entrdCi or a dish of fillets of 
soles, that has been returned untouched, you 
may make a salade with them. Parez your 
fillets nicely. Contrive always to procure some 
green sallad, of any sort, to dish them with. 
Nature will always supply you with agreeable 
colours, without your ever painting whatever is 

intended to be eat. I like to see a bed of fresh 

• 

fi^llad^ or of mustard seed, on a dish. Then 



346 

lEth faar fillets en ndro/ton; ornament them 
wnA beet-root, nastartium^ small white onions 
-stewed, cliervil, pickled cucumbers, red turnip^ 
vedishes ; but above all things, take care not to 
lose time in ornamenting your salades, and that 
the sauce be not poured over the decoration, 
(The sauce for a sallad is to be found at the 
article of sauces fraides, or cru^.) The aspic 
dtjileis de soUes^ is hardly admissible except at 
balls, when the multiplicity of dishes may 
require their being introduced ; but in general it 
is but a very indifferent article. (See Sauces 
mspic^) First brush the mould all over with oil, 
put a little aspic in a mould to acquire a sub- 
stance ; when the aspic is chilled, do whatever 
your skill and ingenuity may suggest. This 
.work is only a theoretical treatise, wherein it 
is impossible to detail what relates to taste alone. 
Use a little liquid to stick what you have deco- 
rated. When you have completed this, put it in 
the ice. When become a solid substance, put 
a little aspicy which let get into jelly. Then 
place your fillets ; stick them together befbn 
you fill the moul<l ; when they are quite sdid, 
£11 the mould, and when the contents are be- 
come solid also, rub the mould outside, with a 
towel dipped into hot water, that it may empty 
and -turn neater.

N? lO.-^Craquettes de Fillets de SoUes. 
Several books mention croquettes demiumon^ 
croquettes de mofuej which, indeed^ are not 
eatable. Sturgeon and soles are the onty two 
^fiorts of fish, that have a sufficient firnmess to 
allow their being made into crequettes. The 
more a fish is presented to the fire, the more its 
taste becomes unpalatable. With regard to 
'i^[^& croquettes o( %o\es, reduce your sauce, throw 
yotir small dice into the sauce, season them wdl, 
und put the whole preparation in the ice. Whea 
<!o1d, cut them into equal parts on a dish. Roll 
•them either round, or oval, but never into 
pears ; dip them into an omelette of tiiree eggs, 
two whites of which you have laid aside, witfa'i 
little salt, and then into crumbs of bread. Dip

HARENGS-FRAIS. 

Hf:RRiNGS are an excellent fish ; but the flesh 
IS so delicate that no cook attempts to dress them 
otherwise than broiled or fried. Those with soft 
roes are the most delicate. You know them to 
be very fresh when the eyes are very red, and 
the scales shine bright. You must broil them 
over a brisk fire, but never wash them. You 
must empty and scale them carefplly, cut off a 
small piece of the tail, and of the head. Send 
them to table with the sauce fL la moutarde. (See 
fauces.) 

N? 1. — Laitancesde Harengs en caisse. 

Your herrings must be very fresh. Have a 
paper case, either round or square ; spread som^ 
butter at the bottom; then open the number of 
herrings you think '^proper, and put the soft inoes 
into the case, without breaking them. Dqst

"done, put a little maltre d^hdtel in the case, with 
the juice of a lemon. Send them up quite hot 
and very firm. 

GROUBINS. PIPER. 

This fish is seldom eat in England. It is to 
be boiled in eau de sel^ well drained and served 
either with sauce aux capres, or a mnitre cTMtel^ 
You may dress it in fillets as yo«i do the fillets 
of soles. It may also be baked. 

ROUGET. RED MUILETS. 

This fish although of the same make as tbe 
groudin, is more delicate, besides it is of a fine 
pink colour, as the French name indicates. It 
is to be stewed also in eau de sely and serve up 
with wasterfitke, a maitre d*h4tel, or la sauce 
aux capres* 

MAAUEREAUX; 

N? I . — Maquereau grille a la Maitre d'Hiitel. 

Mackarel is a fish generally esteemed by all 
ranks of people. T he rich eat it on account of 
its good savour, the poor because it is cheap. 
It must not be washed, when intended to be 



350 

liroiled. Empty and wipe it well/ Open thcS 
back, whereiQto introduce a little salt and oiL 
Broil it on a gentle fire ; turn it over on hotix 
sides and likewise on the back* With the point 
of your knife try if it be done^ by detaching the 
bone from the flesh. Some people will stuff it 
with butter kneaded with chopped parsley^ 
pej^r^ sdlty and the juice of a lemon, but for 
a noblefnan*s table it is better to send it up with 
a nudtre cThdlel fondue.- (See Sauces.) 

N? 2. — Maqiiereau houilli h VAngleise. 

When your mackarel have been emptied and 
washed clean, put them into boiling water, with 
% handful of salt, and let them boil very fast, 
(hat they may be more firm. When they are 
done, drain them, and serve them on a 
cloth with green fennel all round. As for the 
sauce, . bUnch some fennel in salt and vrater. 
When it is quite soft, drain it, chop it, and mix 
it wijh the sauce au beurre. Gooseberries are 
also used for the sauce^ Blauch them, when soft 
lay them in a hair sieve to drain. Squeeze them 
with a wooden spoon, and strain them though a 
hair sieve. Throw the pulp into a stew-pan with 
m little sugaf, and when hot send up your sauot

let the sauce be liquid enough to penetrate the 
soft roes. Of all things send up quite hot. This 
entree is much esteemed by the daintiest epicures. 
N. B. If you have a grand dinner, four 
mackarel will make two entries without any 
connoisseur having occasion to find fault, as 
they will both differ in taste as well as in ap* 
pearance. 

VIVE GRILLES. 8£A-DRA60Nt 

^Sea-dragon is a fish that is seldom eat in 
England^ although in France it is frequently

sent up to table; Tovrards the gill there is • 
most venomous bone* We always broil it, and 
aerve it up with a heurre d'anchois. or a maitre

AKCHOIS. 

Anchovies are a salt fish that are of great ser- 
viee, and of frequent use in cooking. Essence 
of anchovies is a thing which a skilful cook must 
never use. Make a beurre d^anchois yourself. 
For a dozen of anchovies, a quarter of a pound 
of butter will do. First wash your anchovies^ 
so that no lime whatever remains. Take off the 
bones and nns. Pound the meat with the fresh 
butter. When well pounded rub the whole 
through a hair sieve, and secure it in a gallipot 
well covered t Use your beurre d*afichois when 
wanted, for either canap^s^ sallads, or fish sauce : 
anchovies are very seldom used with meat. 

£.PERLANS. 

Smelts are most generally fried. In the 
French way after having wiped them clean, we 
skewered them in a row, through the eyes, 
dipped them into flour and fried them in oil. 
In England they are dipped into an omelette 
and crumbs of bread mixed with flour. They 
take a fine colour. Send them up with fried

number of people you have at dinner. Cut your 
lobster in two without breaking the shell. Clean 
the inside of the shell, cut the meat of the 
lobsters into small dice ; retain the kind of Jarce 
that is inside. Then take one or two spoonfuls 
of veloute J a small lump of butter, a little salt 
and pepper, and keep stirring that sauce over 
the fire. When it in quite hot, throw the meat 
and farce into the sauce ; and ISy the whole in

Give it a colour with the salamander and keep 
your fish hot. Never let it get a colouring in

order that they may stick together, rub that

rather thick, with which you mix your eggs, 
add a little anchovy butter. Mix your sauce 
well before you put in the meat; then add a little 
caince (from Mackay*s) and one or two spoonfuls 
of cream, with a little salt. Never allow this 
sauce to boil, but send it up to table in a boat.

OF EGGS IN GENERAL- 



Eecs are indispensable in cookery. They are 
ibed for a prodigious quantity of entries, entre^ 
imttf and sauces. Eggs are the fundamental 
stone of all pastry. I shall endeavour to shew 
in whatever manner they may be used either en

N? 1. — V Omelette baveuse. 

This denomination will appear rather vulgar^ 
but it cannot be avoided. Break eight eggs in

a sufficient quantity of water to melt the salt. 
Beat your eggs well : then throw an ounce and a 
balf of fresh butter into a frying-pan^ and melt 
it over a brisk 6re : then pou^ the eggs into the 
patty which is not to be kept too close to the 
fire. Now keep turning continually, but never 
let the middle or centre be over the fire, for it ia 
always rather too hot. Gather all the border 
together, and roll your omelette before it gets 
too mach done. The middle part must always 
be kept mellow. Roll it equally with your knife 
tiefore your dish it, and take care not to let the 
pan soil the dish.

This root when black we call salsifts, if white 
it goes by the appellation of scorsonaires. This 
latter is by no means so tender or palatable as 
the former, however both are prepared and 
done in the same manner. You scrape them 
gently, so as to strip them only of the outside 
peel. You then cut them into equal pieces, and 
throw them into water with a little vinegar, or 
lemon-juice, to prevent their getting black. 
When you have scraped a sufficient quantity, 
you stew them in a little butter and salt, and 
water enough for them to swim at ease. They 
will generally be done in three-quarters of an 
hour; yet it is better to ascertain the fact by 
taking a piece out of the water, and to try with 
your knife whether they be done enough, which 
IS the* case when the knife penetrates easily/

the top. The artichokes will be done in threes 
quarters of an bourns time if they be yoang

aome old ones amongst the number^ it is better 
to ascertain with the point of your knife

flour, three entire eggs, a tea spoonful of olive 
oil, and keep stirring the whole with a wooden 
spoon, till the leaves are well imbibed. You 
then have some dripping, that must not be too 
hot, so that your artichokes may be done of a fine 
brown colour. You throw your artichokes into 
the dripping piece after piece, and use a skewer 
to prevent their sticking together. When they

White beans when new and fresh^ are pot

be soaked for an hour before you boil them. 
You put them into cold water to boil, and 
replenish with cold w&ter also, which makes the

done before you dress theni ^ la n^tre d'Mtel,

CUCUMBERS. 

N? 1 . — Les Qmcambres Jarcis. 

Take four or six cucumbers^ according to the 
size of your dish ; cut them in the shape of a 
screw^ which is done by means of leaning with 
your thumb on the blade of your knife whilst 
cutting the cucumber^ at an equal distance* 
When you have thus toumi the outside, you 
empty the inside with a scooper. Take great 
care not to bruise the cucumbers, * which when 
prepared you throw successively into some water* 
Then take a little Jfarce a quenelles^ or some 
sodiveau (see Farces), with which you fill your 
cucumbers. Now blanch them, and mark them 
in a stew-pan with layers of bacon and a little 
salt; moisten with some good consomm^y and 
)et them stew, but not too long. Lay them on 
a towel to drain, and send them up with a fine

The rice is to be prepared as above N? 1 , but 
. must be put into smaller moulds. Mind that 
the cassolettes A*e to be made quite cold before 
• you take them out of the mould. The best 
method of filling up the cassolettes consists in 
taking a carrot, which you cut out of a proper 
larger size to make a hole in the rice ; this hole 
you fill up with an iminci of fowl' au vehuf^. 
This dmincd must be thoroughly cold- When 
you fill up the mould with the rice, close the 
former without allowing any of the SmincS to be 
mixed with the rice, in which case the casso-

leftes would break in the dripping when you fry 

, them. For preventing a similar accident the 

dripping must be very hot It is tolie observed 

^hat in the making of cassolettes, the rice must

N? 3.^L6 Gateau de Ris. 

After having prepared your rice as in N? 1, 
you* take some good cream^ which you boil^ 
first to ascertain it will not curdle ; the quantity 
whereof is proportionate to the mould you in- 
tend to use. For a quarter of a pound of rice 
you take a quart of cream^ which however is 
not always sufficient; this depends on the rice 
swelling more or less: in this case you add a 
little milk to it. Wheii your cream has boiled 
take the peel of a lemon which infuse in the cream 
for a quarter of an hour^ take the peel out before 
you pour in the rice, which lay on a very slow 
fire till^it bursts, or swells ; when well swollen 
add a little salt, and some sugar, according to 
your own palate, the sugar however must pre- 
dominate, the salt being only intended to remedy 
the insipid taste that is the general companion 
of sweet entremets. Sugar must entirely pre- 
dominate in articles for a dessert, but in entre^

mets it is to be used moderately. When your 
rice is done ' enough, and properly seasoned^ 
break eight eggs, mix the yolks with thjp rice, 
next beat the whites ' which you pour gently 
into the preparation, put likewise a good bit of 
butter ; then clarify about a quarter of a pound 
of butter, and when it is completely clarified 
pour it into the mould; turn your mould 
round that the butter , may be spread equally 
on all parts of the mould which you then 
turn upside down for a moment : you then put 
crumbs of. bread into the mould, tod contrive 
to have them likewise spread equally all over the 
mould ; now dip a small piece of paper into the 
butter, sprinkle some butter all round the- 
mould, and put some more crumbs of bread» 
This being performed to your satisfaction, pour 
your rice into the mould, and put it into the 
oven, but nund it be not too hot. An hour is 
required for your' gateau to be baked enough. 
Turn it upside down in the dish, and serve up*

perly seasoned, let it cool ; then roll it into 
croquettes in the shape of a cork. You next 



431 

strew over them crumbs of bread (by Tvhich i« 
'tneant that you dip tbcm firrt into 9M omelette^ 
•and Bext *into crumbs of bread). Roll them 
several times in those crumbs that they may be 
made of a fine colour. When you have fried 
them of a good colour, you may gla2e them on 
one side with pounded sugar by using the sala- 
mander. Seud up with fried parsley of a nice 
colour in the centre.

as many eggs, whereas in a souffle you put only 
six yolks and eight whites, and a little more butten 

N? Q.'^^Le Ris gratini. 

Take two ounces of rice, which wash^ pick^ 
&c. You then let it swell in hot milk, as cream 
when used for entremets of this sort would turn 
into butter. When your rice is well done, 
pound half a dozen of sweet almonds, and the 
same quantity oT bitter ones ; when you have 
made them into a paste^ mix them with your 
rice^ together with a little sugar^ and very little 
aalt. Then pat your rice in a silver pan w 



422 

porringer, and leave it to gratiner on a slow 
fire for three-quarters of an hour. Instead of 
using the lid, only cover the pan with a sheet of 
paper to "prevent the dust. Serve hot ; if you 
put a cover to it the steam will prevent lis gratin. 

N? 7.—Le Turban de Ris. 

Prepare your rice as in N? 3 . You have 
^some apples cut into quarters, which you have 
stewed in sirop. Take particular care that the 
quarters be kept entire. Dish your rice, put a 
gallipot in the middle, in order to procure a 
vacuum, into which you pour a crime pattis^ 
sih^e. (See Grimes.) Dish or dress the rice 
round the gallipot, and level it with the back of 
a spoon. You next place the apples round the 
rice till you have reached the summit of the 
latter, •and put the whole into the oven, but 
only leave it there time enough to^dryupthe 
- sirop which stick<( round the apples. You next 
decorate with sweetmeats of difllerent colours, 
such as green gages, apricots, and cherries, and 
when you are ready to send up you remove the 
gallipot, and fill the vacant place with crime 
pattissikre. 

N. B. — Many entremets are made of crime

try a little of the preparation in a small mould

It is to be observed that the isinglass must 
previously be melted in a little water, (See me- 
thod of melting isinglass). . 

N? 4.—Cr^me a fa rafiiUe. 

Take one or two sticks of vanilla, which in-

put a smaller quantity of eggs, and keep con^ 
etantly stirring your cream on the fire, whilst 
your eggs are getting done. - Mind that the eggs 
be not overdone. When you perceive your cream 
is getting thick, put the isinglass in, and rub it 
through a tammy^ then put it into a mould and

Melt about an ounce of sugar m a confee*

'4>ut mind to' keep continually stirring to prevent 
'the sugar getting a bitter taste. Wheni)mte 
^rown, dilute it with a little water, to which 
.add a little sugar to remedy the -bitter taste. 
'Next use -a little more water to melt the carameL 
When' this is melted, take a pint of cream that 
4ias been boiling, throw yoar caramel into this 
'^ream; and put a sufficient quantity of sugar to 
(make it palatable. Now, if you wish to have 
your cream to the ice pour in the yolks of eight 
eggs ; but if you intend to have it d Vcmf 
seulement you must use twelve eggs. In the 
.first ease, when the e^ are well mixed -you 
.put them on the fire to thicken, and when tiie

The Manner q/* melting Ismglmss 
Tb melt a quarter of a pound of kinglass^ 
'take a little more than a pint of water, into 
which throw the twelfth part of the white of aa 
egg ; beat the water well till it becomes white ; 
throw your isinglass into that water, and lajr 

«  # - , •  

it on the iJtove over a very slow fire. If you 
keep it covered it will melt more easily. Take 
care it does not burn, for then it can never 
he- made limpid, and besides it wouTd> have' an 
unpleasant taste*. Fbr ia larger quantity, yoa 

9 r • • • • 

increase that of the water and of the white of 
the- egg, but be cautious to use very little of the 
latter*. Seme people will put in* the peel of ii 
l^mon, wbi^^h is wrongs however, you may 
aqueexe the juice of a lemon intq it if you wairt 
your isinglass to be limpid, but for a cr^nie it ia 
useless. You always put less isinglass than may 
be requisite, because in order to make your crimee 
or jellies in perfection, you always try a little in 
a small mould. If the jelly should not be firm 
enpugh, you put a little isinglass more. It is im- 
possible to determine the exact qqantity which is 
required for cr^me^ or jellies, as the dishes- and 
moulds are never of the same dimension^ The

GEL^Es AU Faurr. 

Tt is to be observed that all jellies made of 
what is called red fruit must be worked cold, 
and be laid on the ice very expeditiously. If 
you were to use a tinned mould llie tin would 
alter the red into a dead blue colour, and also 
apoil the taste ; whereas if you use earthen 
xnoulds your jellies will always look and taste 
better. 

It is also advisable to clarify the isinglass 
Whjlst it is melting: there ms less waste aijd thp 



439 

• * 

jellies \xBve a brighter look. (See auiQiter of 
melting isinglass). 

Put some strawbeniet into an eafthen pan^ 
squeeze them well with a new wooden spocm^ 
mix some pounded sugar with your fruity and 
let them infuse for an hour that the sugar ma^ 
draw out all the juice from the fruit ; now pour 
in a little water, if the strawberries be very 
ripe, squeeze the juice of two lemons to restore 
the acid taste of the strawberries^ for such pre- 
parations as are made too sweet are ever insipid. 
Put all this in a bag nearly new, that the juice 
may be drained clear and limjnd ; mix ' some 
isinglass with your juice, but mind the whole 
be very cold. Now put half a spoonful of the 
jelly in a mould ovdr -some ice to asceft^in 
the degree of its substance. If thick enough 
put the whole in the large mould in the ice^ and 
•cover it also with iee, but no salt^ for it would 
•spoil the bright colour. 

Some people will clarify the sugar, and when 
it is quite limpid and very hot they will throw 
their strawberries into the clarified sugar. This 
method 'is good enough, but then the jelly does 
not keep the taste of the fruit sq welL You 
may try either way« When the strawberries

amiss to repeat that the isinglass must be thrown

gopd jelly. Take the peel of six oranges, throw 
it into a little water, which lay on the cornerof 
a sto^e without allowing it to boil, for fear it 
•hould taste too bitter. Cut your oranges . in 
two: have a silk sieve and an orange squeezer, 
both wbich you dip into cold water, otherwise 
they would absorb the juice of two oranges at 
least. Squeeze your oranges in a sieve over an 
earthern-pan. This being completed pour the 
infusion of (he peel through the sieve ; next a 
pound of sugar or so, in proportion as your 
pranges are more or less acid. Break the sugar 
in a poehn d* office (confectionary pan), pour a 
drop of the white of an egg in about a pint of 
water, beat this water Jill it gets white, pour it 
pyer the sugar, and set it on the fire. Wfaeii 
your sugar becomes frothy or scummy, throw a 
little more water in. Then skim your sugar, let 
it redqce till it begins to bubble ; you then pour 
in the juice qf your oranges. The heat of the 
suga^ will clarify the jelly. Do not let it boil, 
but asf soon as you perceive a yellow scum, skim 
it and pour ypur jelly into a bag. You then 
mix some isinglass either hot or cold. This jelly 
innst not be made too firm, and especially avoid

wherefore would you contrive to make it red.

the decoration from sticking fast. You decorate 
thfs bottom firsts next the sides ; then only you 
put the mould over the ice* Now pour a little 
orange-jelly lightly not to injure your decoration, 
and let it get thick. When the orange- jelly is 
frbzen, thrust the mould deeper into the ice; 
then piit a little more jelly to the height of the 
Jower deco'ration on the sides ; now let the ^ pre- 
paration be made firm again ; mind the jelly is 
never to come higher than the flowerets until the 
f>ottom has been first made firm ; then gradually 
you ascend to the top. Yon then cover and 
encircle your mould with ice. When you wish 
to serve up, you dip a towel into some hot water, 
^nd rub your mould all round. A&certain that 
none of the jelly sticks to the sides before you 
ineddle with the bottom of thd mould. Ydtl 
then rub the bottom with your to^el, and tv[vn

precautions, the two colours would melt and 
mix with one another. This jelly looks beauti-

N. B. — It is to be observed that this jellyt 
pan only be made in winter time ; for, during the 
summer season, the jelly would melt except it 
be made hard, then it will not be good, how* 
(pver you mv^y Wt^rk H in a yery cold place.

The pineapple although a very odorous fruit| 
is not very juicy. Clarify some sugar (seeN? 6) ; 
when your sugar is clapified^ take the rind of 
the pineapple that you have pared ofl; and 
ioumez the best part equally. Let them be 
a little thicker, but of the same diameter as a 
crown piece. Boil it in the sugar, and take the 
sirop into which you squeeze the juice of a 
lemon or two; and put to it some isinglass 
ready melted. Drain the whole through a bag; 
next trim a mould with a little of the jelly of 
pineapple, and when there is about three lines 
deep at the bottom of the mould, put the whole 
on the ice to get a substance, then lay slices of 
pineapple symetrically over the jelly. Mincl 
they be quite dry, and then use a little of jelly 
to make them stipk together. When your jelly 
is come to a substance, fill your mould and put 
some ice all round. If your pineapple does not 
look well enough to be served en miroton, only 
send up the jelly, but keep your slices of the 
fruit in sugar, as they will serve to make another 
Jelly.

add to this a stick of cinnamon, a few doves, a

eggs, for if one of them should not be fresh and 
sweet it would spoil the jelly. B^at the whole 
with a rod, but take care it is not greasy. Lay 
your jelly on the fire and keep beating it till it 
begins to turn white, and to bubble round the 
stew-pan. You then remove the stew-pan from 
the fire, you cover it with the cover^ and lay aomtf 
fire over the coven This fire is intended to pre-^ 
serve the strength of the jelly, which otherwise 
((he steam dropping from the lid of cover) would 
weaken. When your jelly has been srnimering 
for an hour on a very jlow fire, you drain it 
through a bag« It must be drained several

Ycm may make it lighter if you use a great deal 
df butter, but then it has less substance. 1 shall 
treat of the different pdtes. The baking of 
pastry requires particular attention* You must 
be well acquainted with your oven to be enabled 
tp send up nice pastry. The best prepared paste^ 
if not properly baked will be good for nothing 
therefore 1 recommend paying the greatest atten^ 
tion to the various observations containea in this

It is not possible to indicate or determine the 
exact quantity of paste to be made for a pie^ 
since it depends solely upon the size the pie is 
to be. Take two pounds of flour, half a pound 
of fresh butter, and when your flour has been 
properly sifted, spread it round on a table or 
dresser. Make a large hole in the centre, into 
which throw a large pinch of salt. Break a couple 
of eggs entire into that centre, and work the but- 
ter well with your hand, before you mix it with 
the paste ; when it is made malleable, or soft, 
break it into small pieces with your fingers and 
throw those in with the eggs ; you then pour in 
a little water to melt the salt ; now work your 
paste well with your hands^ and make it as firm 



«< 



455 

fts possiblci for if it were not very firm yoa 
never could erect the circumference or-flank works 
of a pie. Now I have found out a method equally 
easy and eipeditious of erecting those walls, for 
I will venture to call them so, by which means 
they never tumble or shrink, as is too often the ' 
eaae nn^erthe management of many unskilful 
paitrjr-^ooks. 

Take a piece or lump of paste, proportionate 
to the size of the pie yon are to make ; mould: ' 
your paste in the shape of sugar-loaf, lay it erect 
on the table, then with the palm of your h^nd^ : 
flatten the sides of your paste ; always keep the 
middle high erect ; when you have equalized it. 
all round, and that your paste is quit4 smooth,, 
squeeze the middle of the point nearly about half 
the height of it, and give it the shape of a hat i 
thus it is kept quite even, and this is executed with 
SO much celerity that you can make a dozen of 
them in an hour*8 time. Now, if you wish to 
make a pdte froid you trim the middle of your. 
paste, and all round with layers of bacon cut of' 

• 

an equal size: lay those layers double all over 
except on th eb order, that you may leave lobm 
to stick the cover or upper crust on. First in* 
troduce some farce (seejarces h pdtds) ; next, as 
you have boned your game or poultry, season 
the middle well with salt, pepper, and allspice

to dilute your paste' with boiling water^ use m 
ivooden spoon to beat it^ but mind you do. not 
make it too soft : when you have beat it well 
with the spoon first, remove the paste from 
the earthern-pan^ work it well on the table^ and 
place it for a moment before the fire that yon 
may work it more easily. With this paste you 
may make either cold or hot pies^ as indicated 
above (see pdte hrisde). This paste indeed does 
not taste so nice as the other; but you may work 
it with greater facility, and it is not liable to so 
many accidents. 

KUILLETAGE. 

Take the same quantity of butter as of, flower^ 
so fhat if you use two pounds of the one yon 
ibmst also use two pounds of the other ; and so 
in a like proportion. Weigh two pounds of 
flower, which shake through a sieve ; then lay it 
on the table ahd make a very large hole ih the 
middle^ throw in a little pinch of salt i^d a few 
small pieces of butter ; use a little cold water to 
melt the salt, take water enough to make your 
paste of the same consistence as your hotter. In 
winter time you must make the paste very firm, 
because then the butter is so. In summer time 
you must' make your paste very soft on aoooont 
of the butter being so. The reason why yoa 



459 

are obliged to do so is, that if the paste were 
not made of a similar substance with the butter^ 
this latter when you turn your paste would break 
through. When you have well worked your 
flower^ you mould it into a large ball which you 
flatten^ or into any kind of a large pad or long 
bag, which you turn into a spiral direction^ and 
flatten the middle. Lay your butter on the 
table with a little water^ handle it a little to 
extract the white liquor^ take a clean towel 
within which squeeze your butter that ho mois- 
ture may remain. Lay the ball of butter over 
the paste^ flatten your butter, then fold the 
paste over the butter so as to wrap it well all 
over. Try whether the paste be hard or firm 
enough to prevent the • butter from breaking 
through it. Now powder a little flower over the 
table and the paste. Roll your paste as smooth 
as possible with the rolling-pin, fold it in three, 
roll it over once more, taking care always to 
powder it over with a little flower to prevent its 
sticking to the table or to the rolling-pin. After 
having sprtiad it ^eH you fold it again in three 
loldis. Makfe two marks oh the top with your 
rolling-pin, %Vemember that it has been rolled 
twice.' Then put it in 2l plafond In aim^d with * 
a little flower on the ground to keep it cool, and 
leave it there for a short while, A moment after 



450 

you turi) it over tvticf ^gain ss above ; tlioA let it 
rest, apd £pve it two turnings more ^vvblph wiU 
make ^\t in al). Now give it a long shape ani) 
ibid it in two. You may then use it to qaake f 
vol m vfnt^ Whei) you only fold your past^ 
double^ it is what is called half a turning ; of 
course yx>u are sensible that your p^ste must 
have had ^ix turnings apd a b^If^ before yoi| 
could ipfike a vol.m v^t, and that you qiust keep 
your paste thicker than for other small articles 
of pastry. Cut your vol au vent of the size of the 
dish in which it is to be ^nt up, and imme- 
diately after put it in 2Lj^hifon^: brusl) it oyer witi^ 
yolks of eggs, open it all roupd with the point 
of a knife, and put it into g very hoi)t oveur Mind 
that the feuilUfage always requires the oven to 
be very hot. |f yoQ were not cautious of ke^- 
ii^S yonr ovep shut the vol au vent wpuld not 
raise perpendicular. When it i^ wel) baked^ 
ai)d of a fine colour take it out of the ov^n, 
remove the leniddle which served as a cpver^ 
empty the paste of the middle whic^ is not 
baked, and lay your vol au pent op some paper 
to extract the butter. When yovi are ready to 
^rv« up, dish yot^r vol ay> vent^ and fill it with 
whatever you think proper.

It is to be observed that the meringues to 
be well made require the eggs to be fresh^ 
and . that you are not to break them until 
the very moment when you are going to use

six whites are sufficient for an entremets. Have 
some pounded sugar that is quite dry^ br^ak 
your eggs in a clean and very deep pan, beat 
your whites without loss of time, till they be 
very firm^ then take as many spoonfula^ of sugar 
as you have eggs, and beat them with the- eggs

over the meringues and blow off the sugar that 
may have fallen on the paper; now lay your 
slits of paper on a board, and bake them in an 
oven moderately hot. As soon, as they begin to 
colour remove them from the oven i take each 
slit of paper by both extremities, turn them 
gently on the table ; take off a little of the mid^ 
die with a small spoon. Spread some ; clean 
paper on the board, turn your meringues upside 
down on that paper, and put them into the ovea 
that the crumb or soft part may ^e baked and

this operation fpr the whole, you put them in a

l>er however that you are not to use articles that 
are very sweet, the meringues being sweet by 
their nature. Mind that your spoon is to be

This paste is one of the forts b^ses of 
pastry ; it is used to :make an infinite number of 
entrmiets of various forms, and of different de* 
nominations, I shall first explain the manner 
of making it; n^xt I shall enumerate briefly it» 
manifold appellations^ 

Take a stew-pan large enough to conbiin three 
pints of water ; pour half a pint of water inte 
it with a quarter of a pound or a little more fresh 
butter, two ounces of sugar, a little salt, and 
ihe peel qf 9k lempn : let the whole bail till tb»

Ijutter be entirely melted. Then talce some of 
the finest flower that is very dry, and shake it 
through a sieve. Take the lemon peel oiit with 
a ladle, and throw a handful of flower in the 
preparation whilst boiling ; however pay atten- 
tion not to put more flower than the liquor can 
soak. Stir with a wooden spoon till the paste 
can easily be detached from, or, no longer 
sticks to the stew-pan or to the spoon : you then 
take it ofl* from the fire. Next break an egg 
into your paste and mix it well ; then break 
a second which you mix likewise ; do not put 
more eggs than the paste can absorb, yet mind 
you do not make your preparation too liquid. It 
is almost certain that between five or six eggs 
will be wanted for the quantity as aforesaid. 
Tou then form them en choux, by which is 
meant in the shape of a ball one inch in circum- 
ference. As this paste swells very much you 
must dress it accordingly. Abroad we use the 
technical word coucber, and we say coucher les 
choux, les biscuits, &c. but when in a foreign 
country We must as much as possible adopt the 
expressions there in common use, I therefore say, 
dress, which is to put the choux on a plafond 
at one inch distance from one another, in order 
that they may undergo a greater eflfect in the 
oven. Srush them over as vsual with an ome--

ten, lower, and in vain would you attetnpt to 
have them rise again : next make them Sry. 
Sometimes you may glaze them ; at other timei 
you may send them up without being glared. 
To detach them from off the plafond, you apply 
the sharp edge of your knife, and take them oi 
gently. You then make a small opening on 
the side, into which you introduce with a tea- 
spoon,* such sw^tmeats as you think proper, and 
send up dished en buisson. 

N* i3«— Be cautious to smell every egg before 
you use them, for a bad one will spoil them all* 

3>ES PETITS CHOUX PRAUK^S. 

I 

The same paste as above, only when your 
choux are dressed on the plafond and dor^, you 
have some sweet almonds chopped very fine, 
which you mix with a little pounded sugar; 
these you powder over your paste. Now turn 
your plafond and powder again with the 
almonds ; next bake and garnish with sweet* 
meats, as indicated above.

moqld in the shape of a basket ; stick them vjeW 
together^ especially about the top, for it is gene- 
mlly the upper pjirt of the basket that is most 
liable to break. In order to procure the handiesfy 
you use the side of a stew-pan of the same cir-w 
cumferfWie as the height of your basket, and 
vtick some of the choujc clo9e to each other to 
make your handles : you next stick the handle 
to the basket. When ready to send up yoa 
pour some eream .k la Chantilli into ' youp 
basket, aod then serve it. If you pay strict 
attention this entretmts will have a pleasing 
appearance* 

AT.jB.--— You may have your choice with 
legard to the shape you give to the choux, and 
miry your moulds either made into baskets round^^ 
or oval» vases,. &c. &c. * Mine) always to butter 
tine moulds inside; otherwise the sugar would 
sticky and the baskets^ &c. would not come out. 

PAINS A LA DUCHESSC. 

TttB same paste again, with this difference^ 
that first on the pasteboard you make round 
balki and subsequently roll them as long as 
-^ yoar finger. You next lay them on the plafond, 
dorez them, and bake them either glazed pr not, 
at y^our option. Trim them with sweetmeats.

choux en biscuits, pits gateaux a la 

< d'artois. 

Take a pint of thin cream^ whmh t)oil ia • 
stew-pan that may contain four quarts, with a 
little salt, a little sugar, a pinch of flowers of 
oranges prdlin^s, and two ounces of fresh bat- 
ter. When your cream has boiled, skim off the 
flowers of oranges. Take some flower that has 
been sifted through a silk sieve ; throw a handfut 
into the boiling cream. , If the cream can absorb 
more, put a little more to dry on the fire, and 
keep stirring with, the wooden spoon till the 
paste no longer sticks to it. Now take five veiy 
fre^h eggs, break three of them entire alternately^ 
tnd stir quick ; then you throw in the other two 
yolks only, but as that is not sufiicient.to 
moisten your paste properly, you add as much 
thick cream to it as the paste can imbibe. Do not 
make your paste too liquid, dress as you would 
biscuits, dorez with a thin omelette, and put 
your choux into the oven. When they are 
baked glaze them first with sugar.; next use the 
salamander, and serve up hot. 

N. B. — ^This method is quite plain, but it 
cannot be altered. You may stick two together 
with apricot marmalade* 

Observation. — ^When you have succeeded so 
hv as 'to ijaake your pdte royah well, it only 



475 

requires a small share of abilities to vary joht 
entremets. You may make a hole on the top ia 
the middle, and 611 it with cri^me pdtissihe, aod 
put it into the oven again. Another time if you 
wish to make rocks, or croquantes^ you manage 
to franie the doors or* apertures, by erecting 
small chouxon^ above another in the shape of 
an arch ; your prdtinez them with chopped 
almonds, which you have made of a green colour 
by means of using le verd d'^inards, and that 
you have subsequently dried. You may also 
shape them into sheaves. Make your choux very 
small yet long. Then' with the sugar aucassi 
stick one round on the dish, and alternately 
another on the border of the dish to strengthen the 
structure. The cJwux are not to be of an equal 
length in this case. Mind with the point of a 
knife to put a little melted sugar all along the 
bdtanets (sticks) to prevent their breaking. Fill 
the middle with the cream h la chantilli, with 
which you mix a little marasquin. If you should 
have a little sugar left, sprinkle it gently into a 
buttered mould to cover the cream. 

LE BISCUIT DE SAVOIE. 

Take a dozen of fresh eggs, break them into 
a vessel that you may put into another containing 
iome hot water. With those eggs mix a pou^d 



I 



tl superfine pounded sugar. BeM diem w^l w 
the vessel which stands in the hot water* When 
yon perceive that your eggs are no longer soft, 
put three-quarters of a pound of flower into i 
silk sieve not very close woven ; mix your flower 
well with the eggs, which is to be dope by meaoi 
of shaking the sieve, then add about two s|)ooa* 
fuls of flower of orange water. If you only vm 
lemon put in. a spoonful of cold water. Rubs 
mould over with butter; powder some sugtr 
round, fill that mould with your preparation, 
powder some sugar round your moukli and bake 
It in aa oven moderately hot« Ascertnin with i 
little skewer whether the middle part be suf* 
ficicntly baked. If the biscuit be not of a very 
large size, it will be baked enough in three* 
quarters of an hour*s time. Biscuits like other 
pastries of a greater magnitude, require the oveo 
not to be so hot, and therefore must be kept ii) 
a longer time. 

PATE A TAETE, DtrE D*^OFFICB. 

SpltEAD on the table two handfuls of flower, 
two ^x>onfu]s of pounded sugar, a pinch of salt, 
an ounce of butter, and a little water to melt 
the salt. Make a hole in the middle ; break 
two eggs entire besides the yolk of one egg wore; 
mix your paste well, and it will serve you fo^ 



477  • 

ttiaking tartes, tartelettesy and for mbimtiiig 
croquantes. You increase the quantity of in* 
gredients according to the quality of paste you 
may have occaaion for. 

PATE D*AMAKDS. 

' Take a pound of sweet almonds, blanch them 
in boiling water ; trice off the peel and put them 
in a mortar, pound theib very well, and add a 
little water to prevent them turning into oil ; 
after they are very fine and quite in a paste^ 
piit in three^uarters of a pound of sugar welt 
pounded ; pound all together in' the mortar. If 
your paste is quite fine, take it from' the mortar 
and put it into a stew-pan over a slow fire, and 
stir with a wooden spoon till your paste beeomet 
white and dry ; how put your paste into a pot 
you have taken care to keep covered^ in order 
to prevent your paste from drying. 

, . TARTELETTE DE CONFITURE. 

Taice some remnant of puff paste, which 
spread on the table with the rolling-pin ; have 
some tartelette mould well buttered ; cut some 
paste with the paste cutter,. Ihe same shape as 
the tartelette mould lay this paste to each 
mould, put a tea spoonful of apricot marmalade 



47a 

io each mould ; now covef your mould with a 
little cover made as follows, 
t Take Bome pdte a Veau chaude (see page 457) 
have a little board engraved of three little coven 
of difierent ornaments^ have some coarse muslin, 
put to it a little fine powder^ tie the muslin as if 
you were going to make a little bag of it, use 
this little bag to prevent the paste sticking to tbe 
board; let it be shaken over the board; take 
some paste which lay over an engraved part of 
the board, press with your thumb equally over 
the paste, then with your knife press with the 
sharp side and cut off the superfluity of the 
paste. With a little paste you take the paste out 
of the mould, and moisten the border of the 
tartelette ; you stick that little cover to the tat'' 
teletteSy put one to each of them, bake tfa^m in 
the oven without any dof*ure^ but when done 
glaze them with a little sugar, and use the sala- 
mander. 

N.B. — You may also make some without any 
coveir, but those with covers look better, and 
.the sweetmeats do not dry Iso much. 

TARTELETTE DE PATE d'aMANDE- 

Spread some almond paste over the pastry 
table^ cut tbe paste with a cutter the same stffi 



479 

as the tartelette ; butter the mould with verf 
little butter, and then put it in the oven when 
not very hot. After the paste is done quite white, 
you tale them off from the mould and garnish 
them with currant jelly, raspberry jam, ,or apri*- 
cot^ &c. As the sweetmeats do not go to the 
oven, they are always of a better colour and 
better taste. 

GAUFRES A LA FLAMANDE. 

. Take a pound of fresh butter, a pobnd of 
fine flower, six or seven eggs ; mix first the eggs 
with the butter in a bason, put to it a little salt, 
sift the flower over the eggs and butter, add to 
it a spponful of yeast ; mix with all that a pint 
of double cream, work it well with your hand^ 
put the bason on the dresser till dinner-^ttuie^ 
Have your gaufre mould greasy with some fat 
bacon for the first only, the othw comes out 
very easy without any other grease. After they 
are all made, you pour some fine sugar over just 
at the time you send them to the table, for if 
you put the sugar sooner it will make them 
soft

bake it very well and serve it always cold. 



For Roasting, it is almost unnecessary to five 
any advice about it; afanost every indiridiial 
understands how to ruast a joint ; the only ab* 
aervation is, a large joint wants the fire mode* 
imte ; for a small one the fire must be very sharp» 
Game in general muat be under done ; and iritfa 
respect to poultry that should be thonMgblf 
done. Roasted meat should always hare a good 
teloar, which depends upon keeping your i^ 
very equal, ao as to give an uniform coknir ta 
every jrairt of it.
