The Paper Bag Cook Book 

Complete Information About This New 
and Desirable Method of Cooking, 
With an Introduction by Emile Bailly, 
Chef of the Hotel St. Regis, and Page 
After Page of Delicious Recipes, 
Including Many of Mr. Bailly's Own. 

(Copyright, 1'Jll, by American-Journal- Examiner.) 

COOKING in paper bags appeals to many housewives as a 
unique, economical, labor-saving method of preparing a meal. 
Indeed, when attended with the expected results, food thus 
cooked retains a delicious flavor and zest which are hardly obtain- 
able through the old way. 

The sealed bag prevents loss of the rich juices or shrinkage of 
the food, and the heat is in most cases more thoroughly distributed. 
This confinement of the heat, of course, greatly reduces the time 
required for cooking and makes a material reduction in the fuel 
bill. As the bag is always placed upon a gridiron in the oven, pots 
and pans are not needed, and the malodorous fumes peculiar to many 
dishes are unknown. 

Like all such innovations, however, the new paper bag 
cookery has its restrictions. Nowhere is success more dependent 
upon repeated experience, and the average person will seldom be 
proud of her first attempt with the bags. 

It should be understood at the outset that the scheme is not 
practicable for a coal range. Gas or electricity is everywhere pref- 
erable, because of the steady heat which can be kept. Neither is 
bag cooking on a large scale to be advised. Hotels and boarding 
houses with their accustomed ranges cannot afford to experiment 
with great quantities, especially since they rarely use gas for the 
more important' dishes. Certain technicalities of seasoning and stir- 
ring the cooking food, only too well known to the cook and the 
chef, are precluded by the closed bag, and while such minor matters 
are negligible in the private residence they loom up significantly in 
the hotel kitchen. 

But at the house, or at the apartment, the paper bag may well be 
employed to great advantage and satisfaction. The up-to-date hostess 
will entertain a party of friends at a "paper bag dinner," and as the 
toothsome viands are brought upon the table concealed in those 



THE SU.MDAY AMERICAN'S 



queer-looking browned sacks naught but exclamations of delight can 
escape her guests when the novel puffed pouchs are slit open and 
give forth volumes of savory, piquant odors. Again, if the busy, 
thrifty woman be delayed by a long afternoon shopping, and reaches 
home only to find time enough to prepare a "hurry-up'' dinner for 
her family, the paper bag readily lends itself to hasty cooking. Fish, 
roasts and some of the vegetables can be easily prepared and made 
ready to serve in a surprisingly s/hort period. 

Until the cook is accustomed to the various times required for 
different dishes, she will probably be harassed by doubts as to when 
the dish is done. She cannot see inside of the bag, and to rip it open 
would destroy the benefits that are to be obtained only by the closed 
bag, but if she wishes to see whether the dish is properly cooked it is 
easy to press gently on the bag and feel whether the meat or fish is 
thoroughly tender. 

The cooking of our food in a paper bag is not new. The 
present idea, without doubt, grew out of the old and familiar method 
of cooking en papillote. But the difference between these dishes en 
papillote and the latest idea of cooking in bags is that, as a rule, 
most of the old dishes were prepared and sometimes half cooked 
before they were put into the paper. Of course, this was therefore 
a matter for the chef and many assistants, who desired to attain a 
certain flavor, rather than a device to save labor. In olden times 
our forefathers used to cook their game and fruits wrapped in leaves 
and parchment, and we ourselves, when camping, frequently wrap a 
bird in a piece of old linen, then in coarse brown paper, and roast 
it on the ashes of the camp fire. Now the idea is brought into the 
home and made practical. All that is necessary is an oven, a grid 
and a paper bag. 

The bag, firmly fastened at the bottom and up the sides, keeps in 
all the smell of cookery, all the albumen of the food, and prevents 
loss of weight in cooking. In either roasting or baking, beef loses 
25 per cent of its weight when cooked by the ordinary methods. In 
the paper bag, however, it loses none of its weight and no particle 
of its essence. 

When the food is taken from the bag a small quantity of con- 
centrated gravy first rolls out, and it is the purest and best broth 
that can be imagined. The time that the gas oven has been in use 
for preparing the meal is reduced by at least one-third. There is not 
the faintest trace of odors from the kitchen, not even in the case of 
vegetables, which sometimes smell rather strongly, as cauliflower, for 
instance. 

The paper bag system notably allows freedom from grease. Many 
dishes which are too rich for the digestion when cooked in the usual 
way may be put into a paper bag with no more butter than is neces- 
sary to grease the bag, and will be found to have gained in savor 
and delicacy of taste, while so completely free from grease that they 
will not disagree with the most delicate digestion. Furthermore, 
there is no scrubbing out of a greasy oven, with dripping clinging to 
its sides; no washing out of the dripping pan or baking dish. A 



PAPER BAG COOK BOOK 3 

spotlessly clean oven is left, and when the bags have been burned 
up and the dishes washed the cook's labors with the finished meal 
are over. 

Many housekeepers have discovered how to freshen and reheat 
bread by wrapping it in a paper bag. Biscuit that have been cooked 
for twenty-four hours, while having lost only one per cent or one- 
half per cent of moisture by evaporation, are nevertheless dry. Their 
crusts are brittle, though the heart will be moist. If the moisture 
can be redistributed the biscuit will become almost as good as when 
first baked. Nothing will accomplish this redistribution as well as 
paper wrapping. 

Soups cannot be cooked in bags, as the expansion caused by 
evaporation bursts the paper. Vegetables and desserts give varying 
success, some turning out to perfection and others proving less pala- 
table than when cooked in the pan. But eggs in every style, fish, 
entrees and roasts are always delicious, and it is here that the 
epicurean though frugal housekeeper will reap the many profits of 
paper bag cookery. 

EMILE BAILLY. 

St. Regis Hotel, October 14, 1911. 



General Directions 

PAPER bag cookery is done in the oven. Gas fires, electric stoves 
or oil stoves are all equally efficacious, but the time varies and 
must be learned by experience. A wire grid must always 
be used in the oven under the bag, in order that the heat may circu- 
late. Each bag must be well inspected before using, to make sure 
that there are no holes. Use a light brush to paint the interior of 
the bag with drawn butter before placing the food inside. Dripping 
or good olive oil may also be used. 

The heat of the oven should at first be about 300 degrees Fahren- 
heit. If there is not an oven thermometer attached use the ordinary 
white paper test, and if it turns brown at once the oven is right. 
With a gas fire take out the grid shelf and turn the gas on full for 
eight minutes before using the oven. Leave it three parts on for five 
minutes after putting the dish in the oven, then turn the gas half 
down during the rest of the cooking. This will reduce the heat to 
about 200 degrees, which is the proper temperature for paper bag 
cookery, on the average. 

Several dishes can be cooked at the same time in separate bags. 
The bags retain everything, and there is no possibility of flavors 
intermingling. Bags cannot be used twice, for, after being in the 
oven they crumple and tear very easily. In cases where a 
brown surface is required, such as for chicken, duck and similar 
game, break open the top of the paper bag or prick it with a wooden 
skewer about ten or fifteen minutes before taking it out of the oven. 



THE SUNDAY AMERICAN'S 



It is also advisable when cooking pastry to prick the top of the bag. 
This will help to give the food a delicate, golden brown. 

Always slide the bag and its contents on to a hot dish; then slit 
the bag with a pair of clean scissors, kept specially for the purpose, 
and draw away the paper carefully. To avoid any possible leakage, 
close the bag by folding down the top (the open end), fold over 
three times, fasten with a clip, and turn up the bottom corners of 
the bag. Keep the bags well away from the gas jet; otherwise they 
are apt to scorch and burn. 

Although the bags are waterproof, they will hold only a small 
quantity of liquid safely. 

In order to prevent any possibility of the paper bag breaking or 
bursting, either before or after being placed in the oven, the follow- 
ing hints should be observed: 

Select the size bag that will conveniently hold the food intended 
to be cooked in it. Examine carefully to see if there is the slightest 
rent or break. If so, paste over with white of egg or a paste made 
with flour and water. The least hole m the bag is certain to in- 
crease in size when placed m a heated atmosphere, thus causing loss 
of gravy or juice from food. 

Cut, saw or trim off all projecting sharp bones, fins or pro- 
truding edges from food that are likely to tear the paper before 
placing it in the bags. Without this precaution meat or poultry is 
likely to cause incisions in the bag perhaps unknown to the cook. 

After greasing the bag, and when the food necessary for the 
dish has been inserted, fold the open end several times and fasten 
with one or more paper wire-clips, or with small, thin wooden 
skewers, so as to seal hermetically the bag. It is a good plan to 
fold in also the corners at the bottom of the bag to insure against 
leakage. 

The paper bag, when filled with the food and ready for cooking, 
must be placed in the oven on a so-called grid shelf, such as is 
usually provided in gas cooking stoves. 

After the first 15 or 20 minutes that is, when the cooking has 
sufficiently advanced the heat of the oven must be slightly reduced 
until the food is quite cooked and tender. 

For flat fish allow from 10 to 15 minutes to the pound for it to 
be tender and fit to serve. Small fillets need only 8 to 10 
minutes, while practically all roast meats require 20 to 25 minutes to 
the pound. Stews will take 45 to 60 minutes; chicken and duck, 35 
to 40 minutes, but small birds should cook only 15 to 20 minutes. 
Sausages, ham, liver and bacon and kidney need but 8 to 10 minutes. 

Vegetable stews and vegetables must be cooked 25 to 30 minutes. 
Finally, all sweets, including pastry, rissoles and patties require from 
15 to 20 minutes. When cooking milk puddings in paper bags the 
p'- " r nz ust be made in the ordinary way in a shallow pie dish. 
This is then slipped in, and the bag is folded and fastened as usual. 

if the bags are put on a hot baking sheet the cooking will be a 
failure, because it is necessary for the hot air to' circulate and com- 
pletely surround the food, or the bags will burst as soon as they are 



PAPER BAG COOK BOOK 



laid on a hot, solid surface. In a gas oven it must be remembered 
that the lower grid must not be put in the lowest groove, or the 
bags will catch fire from being too near the flame. The top grid 
should be put in the groove nearest the top of the oven, if that 
will allow the bags to lie conveniently on it, and the second grid as 
near the first as may be convenient. Sometimes, when people are 
living in apartments, there is a supply of gas, but no cooker. In 
such a case it would be easy to buy a gas ring and tubing and attach 
it to a gas jet. Over the ring a tin oven should be placed, and it 
will be found that a paper bag dinner can then be prepared most 
successfully. 

At the end of the specified time a peep into the oven will reve-i 
the array of paper bags probably well browned, but not burned. If 
there has been the slightest smell of burning paper it should at once 
be investigated and the gas reduced. After removing the food from 
the oven a pair of scissors should be at hand to slit open the bag, 
which must then be destroyed, leaving the nicely browned, perfectly 
cooked viand on the dish. There will be very little gravy, as that, 
of course, is the juice of the meat, and the claim of the paper bag 
cookery is that it seals up the juices WITHIN the meat. On no 
account add water to the few spoonfuls of rich, strong gravy in the 
dish, for that would completely spoil the delicious flavor. In families 
where much gravy is desired it must be made separately with a little 
stock, browned and thickened. The potatoes can then be turned out 
of their paper bag into a hot dish, and the same process can be 
followed with the other vegetables. Cauliflower requires gentler 
handling. Its bag should be slit, and it should be slid carefully into 
a dish filled with white, hot sauce ready prepared. The pudding 
may be left in the oven, the gas turned very low, so that it may 
keep hot, but not cook any longer, until it is required. Thus an 
entire meal, with the exception of the soup, is cooked and ready to 
serve through the paper bag system. 

The most distinctive of American culinary processes, the clam- 
bake or fishbake, has long utilized the paper bag in the production 
of some of its most delectable courses. It may be a fish or a meat 
course. "Weakfish are cleaned and salted and then carefully wrapped 
in thick manila paper, or Frankfort sausages may be treated in the 
same way. Dozens of these rolls are placed on the hot rock where 
the bake fire has been started and then covered with seaweed. At 
the right moment they are carried to the table and each diner is 
served with a delicious, steaming hot fish or sausage, dropped onto 
his plate from the paper. By this process none of the flavor is lost 
from the fish or sausage. The paper becomes oiled with the fish and 
its pores practically filled, so that no steam escapes through them. 
The flesh is thus peculiarly tender and tasty. 

In general, it may be stated that there are less dangers to be 
avoided in paper bag cookery than in any other method. Here it 
is not necessary to open the oven door every once in a while to 
baste the food or to see how the cooking is progressing. The oven 
can be relied upon to do its work thoroughly, as the whole force of 



6 THE SUNDAY AMERICAN'S 

the heat surrounds the bag and cooks the food to a turn. But the 
oven must always be opened cautiously, as a draught from a door or 
window may easily ignite a bag from the gas burner and thus destroy 
the food if not removed immediately and placed in a new bag. In 
removing the bag from the oven a plate should be placed gently 
underneath and the bag withdrawn to the plate with the fingers, cut 
open and thrown away at once. 



Remember These "Don'ts" 

1. DON'T forget to examine each bag carefully before using, and 
if any possible rent, tear or tendency to become unfastened is 
discovered to repair the defect with white of egg or a little 
paste made with flour and water. 

2. DON'T omit to brush over the inside of each bag thoroughly 
with clarified butter, clarified dripping, lard, or good olive oil. 

3. DON'T fail to cut, saw or trim off all projecting sharp bones, 
fins or pointed skewers, such as are likely to pierce the paper 
bag. 

4. DON'T forget, when once the food has been placed in the proper 
sized bag, to fold over at least twice the opening of the bag, and 
fasten with wire clips; to turn down both corners, and secure 
also with a wire clip. 

5. DON'T put the loaded bag on a hot grid, trivet or shelf in the 
oven; place it on a cold grid on the hot oven shelf. 

6. DON'T forget to remove the top portion of the paper bag a few 
minutes before the meat is done when a joint or bird is required 
to be nicely browned. 

7. DON'T forget to ascertain the correct heat of the oven before 
putting in the food. 

8. DON'T place the paper bag in too hot an oven, or, in the case 
of a gas oven, too near the gas jets, so as to cause the paper to 
scorch or burn. 

9. DON'T attempt to economize when once a bag is scorched; re- 
move it at once and put the food in a fresh bag. 

10. DON'T forget to use a wire trivet or grid to support the bag in 
every case, whether the oven shelf be of the "solid" or "open- 
bar" variety, whether the cooking be done by gas, coal,, oil or 
electricity. 

11. DON'T omit when baking pastry to punch or pierce a few small 
holes here and there in the end of the bag with a skewer or the 
prongs of a fork; this will insure the pastry acquiring a golden 
brown. 

12. DON'T spill or otherwise waste any liquor or gravy retained in 
the bag in which certain kinds of food is cooked; it is valu- 
able and should be made good use of. 

13.^_DON'T forget to dish up all foods neatly; put the whole bag as 
it leaves the oven on a large dish, cut or break the paper and 
place the food carefully on a dish. 



PAPER BAG COOK BOOK 



Fish Recipes. 



COD, salmon, halibut or any other kind of fish suitable for 
boiling can be cooked successfully in a paper bag. After clean- 
ing, trimming and wiping the fish thoroughly, butter the 
inside ot a paper bag of suitable size; then put in the fish, with 
one or two slices of onion and carrot, a little vinegar or lemon 
juice and enough salted water to moisten the fish well. Allow abou 
a pint of water to two pounds of fish. Fold in the end of the ba^ 
with two folds, then fasten with several wire clips and place it 
carefully onto a cold wire tray or grid and put it in the oven to 
cook. 

The oven should register about 225 degrees when the fish is put 
on. The time required for cooking depends greatly on the shape 
and thickness of the fish. Two pounds of cod will take about 25 to 
30 minutes. 

To serve take out the bag carefully with the grid; slit the paper 
and lift out the fish with a fish slice or small skimmer and place it 
on a hot dish. Garnish with sprigs of parsley and serve. 

BAKED HERRINGS. 

Remove the heads from three or four fresh herrings. Split them 
open and take out the backbones. Season the inside with salt and 
pepper and dip them in a little milk and dredge with Scotch oatmeal. 
Melt some fat and with it brush over 'the prepared herrings. Then 
place them side by side in a paper bag, fasten the end and cook on a 
wire grid or perforated shelf in a hot oven for about 10 minutes. 
Dish up and serve. 

BAKED MACKEREL. 

Procure a good-sized mackerel, wipe it with a damp cloth, split 
it open and remove the bones, also the head and fins. Prepare a 
stuffing composed of two ounces of chopped beef suet, two to three 
tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one teaspoonful of savory herbs 
and some chopped parsley. Spread the inside of the mackerel with 
this, fold over and put the fish in a greased paper bag, pour a little 
oiled butter over the fish and fasten the bag securely. Bake on a 
wire grid in a moderate oven for about 25 minutes. Dish up and 
serve plain or with anchovy sauce. 

FILETS OF MACKEREL. 

Procure two good-sized mackerel, wipe them and carefully 
remove the fish from the bones. Place the filets thus obtained in a 
deep dish, season with salt and pepper and a little lemon juice, then 
pour over a tablespoonful of vinegar and add a few thinly cut slices 
of carrot and onion and one bay leaf. Cover the dish and allow to 
stand for about half an hour. Take up the fish and drain on a 
cloth. Put the cut vegetables in a well-buttered grease-proof paper 
bag, and upon them place the filets of fish, skin downwards, then. 



8 THE SUNDAY AMERICAN'S 

brush over with a little oil or butter. Fold over the end of the b^g, 
fasten with clips and cook in a quick oven on a grid or trivet from 
8 to 10 minutes. Take out the bag, remove the fish on to a hot dish, 
put a little neatly shaped parsley butter on top of each. Garnish 
with thin slices of lemon and sprigs of parsley and serve. 

PARSLEY BUTTER. 

Mix one ounce of fresh butter with a teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley, a saltspoonful of chopped mixed tarragon and chervil, a 
teaspoonful of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper. Spread 
on a plate, put on the ice and shape into pats when quite firm. 

COD STEAKS WITH HAM. 

Procure two slices of cod, each weighing from half to three- 
quarters of a pound. Wipe it and place on a buttered dish. Prepare 
a mixture of bread crumbs, savory herbs and parsley and bind it 
with a little beaten egg. Place this upon each slice of fish and season 
with salt and pepper. Put a slice of raw ham or lean bacon on top 
of ach, then place the fish in a well-greased paper bag, fold the 
end and fasten with clips. Put the bag on a grid shelf in a fairly hot 
oven. Bake for about 20 minutes. Dish up and, if liked, pour round 
some anchovy sauce, and serve. 

FILETS OF FLOUNDER. 

Remove the filets from a medium-sized flounder, tut eac. filet 
in two, season with salt and pepper and sprinkle over a little lemon 
juice; fold each filet in two or roll up (skin inwards). Put a small 
piece of butter on top of each and place carefully in a buttered 
paper bag, fasten the ends with clips, and cook for about 10 minutes 
on a wire grid in a hot oven. Cut open the bag and lift out .the 
fish carefully on to a hot dish. Garnish with sprigs of parsley and 
serve. 

STUFFED HADDOCK. 

Wash, scale and wipe a good-sized fresh haddock; remove the 
eyes. Prepare a stuffing with two tablespoonfuls of chopped suet, 
two tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, half teaspoonful of herbs, one 
teaspoonful of chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper. 
Moisten the stuffing with half an egg. Stuff the body of the fish 
and sew up the opening or simply fold in ends. Brush it over with 
beaten egg and sprinkle over some browned bread crumbs and place 
a few very small pieces of dripping, wrap carefully in greased paper 
bag, fold the end and fasten with wire clips and place on a wire grid 
Jin the oven. Bake in a fairly hot oven from 25 to 30 minutes, accord- 
ing to size of fish. Dish up, remove the string and serve. 

FILETS OF HADDOCK. 

Cut the filets neatly from a good-sized fresh haddock, cut each 
filet in two, season with salt and pepper and sprinkle over a little 
lemon juice. Put a small piece of butter on top of each filet and 
place carefully in a well-buttered papr bag, fold in twice, fasten 
the ends with clips and cook for about 10 minutes on a wire grid in 
a hot oven. 



PAPER BAG COOK BOOK 9 

FILETS OF HADDOCK WITH ANCHOVY BUTTER. 

Procure a large haddock, remove the filet s and skin carefully. 
Wipe them with a cloth, squeeze over a little lemon juice, then 
dredge both sides with seasoned flour (flour mixed with salt and 
pepper). Sprinkle over with clarified butter and place the filets in a 
well-buttered paper bag, fold in the ends and fasten with clips, then 
cook on a grid shelf in a hot oven from 10 to 12 minutes. Take up 
the fish, range on a hot dish, put a small pat of anchovy butter on 
top of each filet, garnish with sprigs of parsley and serve. 

FRIED FILETS OF SOLE. 

Remove the skin and fins from two soles, cut off the head por- 
tion, dip the fish fillets in milk and then in flour. Put them in a 
well-buttered paper bag with about two ounces of clarified butter, 
fold in the end of the bag and fasten with clips, place on a wire 
grid and cook in a very hot oven for about twenty minutes. Turn 
the bag twice during the cooking process. Take up the fish, drain 
and dish up. Garnish with quarters of lemon and sprigs of parsley 
and serve. 

SOUCHET OF FISH. 

This can be made of flounder or sole, or any other kind of white 
fish. If soles are used they must be skinned on both sides. Trim 
the fish and wipe it thorbughly. Peel one small onion, half a small 
turnip, a small carrot, and cut each into thin slices, then into fine 
julienne strips. Put the fish with the vegetables in a well-buttered 
paper bag. The fish should be put between the vegetables. Add as 
much salted water as may be required to well moisten the fish (half 
to three-quarters, of a pint). Fold in the bag and fasten with clips, 
turn up the corners and put it carefully on a grid shelf into a 
moderate oven. It will take about half an hour to 40 minutes to cook 
the fish and vegetables. Take out the fish, put it on a hot dish and 
sprinkle over the vegetables and a little stock. Sprinkle over some 
chopped parsley and garnish with slices of lemon. 

FISH CAKES.

Meat Recipes. 



TRIM the meat, if necessary, and cut off any projecting bones, as 
these often cause the paper bags to burst. Wipe it with a 
cloth, then weigh the joint. Allow from 20 to 25 minutes to 
each pound of meat. Veal and pork require a little more time than 
beef or mutton, as the former should always be well done. Dredge 
the cut side of the joint with flour seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Have ready the correct size of a paper bag. Select it rather too 
large than too small, so that there is no possible chance of its break- 
ing when the joint is put in. After spreading a little dripping or 
butter over the meat put it in a well-greased paper bag. Fasten the 
end after folding it with several wire clips. Next place it on a 
grid shelf in a hot oven and cook till tender. When done open the 
bag and dish up the meat. Serve with gravy. 

The time required for cooking depends upon the size and weight 
of the joint. It is safe to allow about 20 minutes to every pound. 
For other information on this point the time table found at the 
beginning of this book should be consulted. 

GRAVY 'FOR ROAST MEATS. 

Pour any fat found in the bag while warm into a basin, which 
keep for future use. Pour a little hot water or stock into a basin 
containing the liquor from the roast meat, stand it in the hot oven 
and add a little gravy salt. This will color the gravy. Season with 
pepper and salt and strain over the meat on the dish. When the 
joint is cut some of its juice will run out and will improve the 
gravy already in the dish. 

BOILED BEEF. 

Procure about two pounds of salt beef and soak it for several 
hours in cold water. Peel and scrape two small turnips and two 



14 THE SUNDAY AMERICAN'S 

carrots, cut them into quarters and put them with the meat in a well- 
greased bag of the required size. Add as much water as the bag 
with its contents will conveniently hold and fold in the end, fasten 
with wire clips and place it on a cold wire grid into a moderately 
heated oven. Cook thus for about 50 or 60 minutes. When done 
take up the meat, put it on a hot dish, garnish with the cooked 
vegetables and pour over a little of the liquor. Serve with boiled 
suet dumplings. 

SUET DUMPLINGS. 

Mix six ounces of sifted flour with three ounces of finely chopped 
beef suet and a pinch of salt, also half a teaspoonful of baking 
powder. Moisten with enough cold water to produce a fairly stiff 
paste. Make this up into small balls and put them in a well-greased 
paper bag with about half a pint of water. Fold in the end of the 
bag and fasten with wire clips, place it on a wire grid in a hot oven 
and cook for about 35 to 40 minutes. 

CHOPS AND STEAKS. 

These can be successfully cooked in paper bags. Wipe the meat 
and trim off some of the fat, if found necessary. Chops should be 
skewered to keep them in shape. Season with salt and pepper and 
brush over the chops or steaks with oiled butter. Put them in a 
well-greased paper bag, place them on a grid shelf in a hot oven and 
cook for about 15 or 18 minutes, according to the thickness of the 
m'eat. A little parsley butter, that is, gutter mixed with salt and 
pepper, lemon juice and chopped parsley, should be put on the meat 
when dished up. There is usually a little gravy in the bag in which 
chops or steaks are cooked. This should be poured over the meat. 

PORK SAUSAGES. 

Divide a pound of sausages and prick them with the prongs of a 
fork, then put them side by side into a well-greased paper bag. Close 
it up and fasten with clips. Place on a wire grid and cook in a 
fairly hot oven for about 15 minutes. 

MUTTON CUTLETS. 

Cut the best end of a neck of mutton into neat cutlets, flatten 
each and trim neatly. Season with salt and pepper and place in a 
well-buttered paper bag, fold in the ends, fasten with clips and cook

MUTTON CUTLETS WITH TOMATOES. 

Flatten slightly and trim neatly six or more mutton cutlets, sea- 
son each side with salt and pepper and place a slice of tomato upon 
each. Sprinkle over with chopped parsley and chives, then put the 
cutlets carefully into one or more buttered paper bags, place in a 
very hot oven on a grid or trivet and cook from 12 to 15 minutes. 
To serve, cut open the paper bag and take out the cutlets carefully, 
arrange them on a hot dish, garnish with sprigs of parsley and send 
to table. 

VEAL CUTLETS, 

Procure about four or five veal cutlets from the best end of the 
neck of veal. Flatten with a cutlet bat, then trim the sides neatly 



PAPER BAG COOK BOOK 15 

and scrape the bones clean, season each with salt and pepper. Melt 
about half an ounce of butter and add to it about a teaspoonful of 
finely chopped parsley, one small peeled and finely chopped shallot 
and a little lemon juice. Brush over each side of the cutlets with 
this, then place them side by side into a thickly buttered paper bag, 
fold in and fasten the ends, then put the bag on a grid shelf or 
trivet and cook in a hot oven from 18 to 20 minutes. Slit open the 
bag and arrange the cutlets neatly on a hot dish, garnish with 
parsley and quarters of lemon and serve with a sharp tomato or 
piquante sauce. 

Note. If liked, a few finely cut slices of streaky bacon can be 
cooked at the same time as the cutlets. These can be placed on top 
of the cutlets or may be cooked in a separate bag. 

STEAMED CHOP. 

Procure two or three mutton or lamb chops and trim each 
neatly, cutting off the superfluous fat, fold in the ends and fasten 
with a skewer, then season with salt and pepper, and spread over 
each side with butter. Place the chops in a well-buttered paper bag 
with a few slices of onion and carrot and, i liked, a few pieces ot 
celery and also three tablespoonfuls of water. Close up the ends of 
the bag and fasten with clips. Then cook on a grid or trivet in a 
hot oven for about 25 minutes. Slit open the bag, take out the chops 
and remove the skewers, arrange the chops on a dish, pour over any 
liquor found in the bag, sprinkle over a little chopped parsley and 
serve hot. 

A dish of mashed or fried potatoes should accompany this dish.

Poultry and Game. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 

Cut the legs, close to thigh, of a chicken, well trussed for roast- 
ing. Spread over the breast part a layer of butter or dripping, 
then put it in a buttered paper bag, fold in the end and fasten with 
clips. Cook it on a grid shelf in a fairly hot oven for about 40 
rrinutes; this is the time a moderate sized fowl v/ill take. Take up 
the bird, remove the skewer and string and put it on a hot dish. 
Prepare some gravy as directed for roast meat. Garnish with water- 
cress and serve with bread sauce. 

BOILED CHICKEN. 

Careful cooks have always boiled fowls and chickens by pre- 
viously wrapping them up in buttered paper, but boiling them in 
paper bags is more convenient and certainly cleaner. Procure the 
bird to bex boiled ready trussed for boiling; rub the outside with a 
cut lemon, then put it in a well-buttered paper bag with a sliced 
onion, a piece of celery, a small peeled onion stuck with a clove and 
a small bunch of herbs, parsley, etc.; add also about a pint of salted 
water; fold in the bag and fasten well with wire clips, or, if pre- 
ferred, tie up the end with string. Put it on a grid shelf in a 
moderately heated oven for about an hour, or less, according to the 
size of the bird. Serve the chicken on a hot dish with its gravy or 
liquor. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE, WITH MUSHROOMS. 

Cut a tender chicken into the usual joints, trim each neatly, and 
cut off any projecting bones. Season with salt and pepper and

with a handful of finely sliced preserved mushrooms, also a small 
onion stuck with a clove, half a carrot and a bouquet of parsley; 
pour over about a gill of stock. Close up the end of the bag, fold 
over and fasten with clips, then place on a wire grid and cook in a 
'moderate oven from 35 to 40 minutes, according to quantity cooked. 
Stir a yolk of egg in a small basin with three tablespoonfuls of 
cream. To this add the strained juice of half a lemon. Take the 
pieces of chicken out of the bag and dress them on a hot dish with 
the mushrooms. Remove the onion, carrot and parsley and strain 
the liquor remaining in the bag into the yoke of egg, etc. Mix 
thoroughly and pour over the chicken. Sprinkle with a little finely 
chopped parsley and garnish with fleurons (half moons or puff 
pastroy), and also, if liked, with thin slices of lemon.

Vegetable Recipes. 

ONLY lately has any attempt been made to cook vegetables in 
paper bags. While it is not advisable to adopt this method 
for every kind of vegetable, the experiments made have proved 
that quite a number can be successfully cooked by the paper 
bag process, notably so the following: Artichokes, broad beans, 
Brussels sprouts, beans, carrots, cauliflower, celeriac, celery, cucum- 
ber, endive, chicory, seakale, mushrooms, parsnips, peas, potatoes, 
salsify and tomatoes. These must in each case be washed, trimmed 
and prepared the same as for an ordinary cooking process, duly 
seasoned and placed with a little water, and, in some cases, butter 
as well, in a grease-proof paper bag (sealed up), and put in a mod- 
erately heated oven on an iron grid, not a solid shelf, as is usually 
found in coal ovens. The heat will thus reach the contents of the 
bag from all sides and top and bottom. From 15 to 35 minutes 
should be allowed to cook any kind of vegetable; some will take 
even less time. 

Dried peas, lentils and haricot beans are excellent cooked in 
paper bags, but they must be allowed to soak for rather longer than 
usual before cooking them. 

It is well to remember that all vegetables must undergo some 
kind of preparation, washing, draining, scraping, peeling, etc., before 



PAPER BAG COOK BOOK 25 

they can be cooked in the correct sense, and unless this is done well 
the success of a dish is often spoiled, so that the paper bag cannot 
be of much help unless this is done. 

Always cook the vegetables on the same day on which they are 
prepared and wanted for table. 

Vegetables of strong flavor, which include almost every kind of 
green vegetable, are not recommended to be cooked in a paper bag. 
They should be cooked in a large quantity of water, sufficient to well 
cover the articles to be cooked. 

The water in which they are cooked must be well seasoned with 
salt. About a teaspoonful to every quart of water is the average 
proportion used. 

As a much smaller quantity of water is used by the paper bag 
system than by the ordinary way, the liquor in which vegetables 
have been cooked is valuable and should be made use of. 

BROAD BEANS. 

This is an excellent way of cooking young broad beans: Shell 
them and put the beans with salted water in a buttered paper 1 bag, 
seal it up and cook on a grid shelf for 20 minutes in a moderate 
oven. Mix a little of the stock or liquor of the beans and a table- 
spoonful of cream with the yoke of an egg, and add a little chopped 
parsley and a few drops of lemon juice. Dish up the beans and pour 
over the prepared sauce. 

CARROTS A LA VICHY. 

Wash and scrape four or eight carrots and cut them into very 
thin slices, season with. salt and pepper and mix with an ounce of 
clarified butter and a gill of stock. Put all into a well-buttered 
paper bag, close it up and fasten with wire clips; place it on a wire 
grid in a moderately heated oven and' cook from 25 to 30 minutes. 
Slit the bag open and put the carrots with the liquor on to a hot 
dish, sprinkle over some finely chopped parsley and serve hot. 

BAKED POTATOES. 

Wash and scrape, or peel thinly, one to one and a half pounds 
of new potatoes; parboil them for a few minutes in salted water; 
then drain, sprinkle over with butter and put them into a but- 
tered grease-proof paper bag. Fasten the bag securely and place on 
a grid or trivet in a hot oven and bake for 25 or 30 minutes. 

POTATO CHIPS. 

Wash and peel thinly four or five potatoes and cut them into 
very thin slices. Put them on a cloth and drain thoroughly so as 
.to absorb all the moisture. Have ready a well-buttered paper bag, 
put in the prepared potato chips and close up the bag. Fasten the 
end with clips and place on a grid shelf in a hot oven. Cook thus 
for about 15 minutes, turning the bag once or twice during this 
period. The potato chips will be found quite cr,isp by this time. 
Open the bag, season the chips with fine salt and dish them up. 



26 THE SUNDAY AMERICAN'S. 

SAUTE POTATOES.

PUFF PASTE. 

Sift half a pound of flour onto a pastry board, make a well in 
the centre, add a pinch of salt, one teaspoonful of lemon juice and 
about a gill of cold water. Knead the paste tho* hly and doll 
out into an oblong strip. Next put 6 ounces of h mtter into a 

cloth, knead a little so as to squeeze out any moisture, and shape it 
into a flat cake. Place the butter in the centre of the prepared paste, 
wet the edges with a brush dipped in cold water and fold over so as 

to completely inclose the butter. Now roll it out very carefully, fold 
' it into three and roll out into an oblong shape again; continue this 

about four or five times, setting the paste aside in a cool place for 
about 15 minutes between each turn. Before using it should be 
allowed to stand for at least half an hour. 

ROUGh PUFF PASTE. 

This is not quite so rich as puff paste, but the results are equally 
good. Add a pinch of salt to 12 ounces of flour (sifted), cut 8 ounces 
of butter into small pieces and mix with the flour; add just enough 
writer to make a firm but smooth paste, roll it out one-third of an 
inch thick, fold in three and let it rest for 10 minutes in a cool 
r place. Roll out again and fold in three. In about 15 minutes roll 

out a third time, again fold in three, and use as directed. This paste 
is eminently suitable for meat pies, sausage rolls, fruit tarts, pas- 
tries, etc. 

RASPBERRY AND CURRANT TARTLETS. 

Roll out, not too thinly, half a pound or more of puff paste, and 
line with it the required number of small pastry hoops or tartlet 

moulds. Fill these with rice or dried peas and slip into a paper bag; 

. prick the top of the bag with a skewer, and bake on a grid in a 
moderate oven for about 12 minutes, or until the paste has acquired 
a golden color. Take out the rice or peas and fill the tartlet crusts 
with prepared raspberries and currants; pour over a little prepared 
syrup and place in the oven again for a few minutes to get hot. 
Sprinkle over with powdered sugar and serve. 

FRENCH CHERRY TARTS. 

Roll out thinly some puff paste, and line with it a large pastry 
hoop or flat cake tin. Fill this with stoned cherries and sprinkle 
over with castor sugar mixed with a little ground cinnamon. Slip 
this into a paper bag, fold in the ends and fasten with clips, and bake 
for about 15 to 20 minutes. When baked, take out of the bag, pour 
over some well-reduced syrup, and serve. 

SWEET BANANA PASTIES. 

x Roll out some rough puff paste and cut it into oblong pieces or 

squares of even size. Spread the centre of each piece of paste with a 

-little apricot marmalade, upon this put half a banana not too ripe,. 

n and sprinkle over with powdered sugar mixed with ground cinna- 

rrnon. Wet the edges of the paste, fold over and press the ends. Now 

brush over with a little milk and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Then
