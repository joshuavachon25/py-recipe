PREFACE 



"Oh, Dear! What shall we have to eat?" What housekeeper 
has never been confronted with this tiresome and ever present 
question ? I have written this book hoping that it may be an ever 
ready answer to that wearisome interrogative. By setting down 
each day what was served on my own table, as a future reference 
to help me in deciding this every day puzzle, the thought occurred 
to me, "Why couldn't I help to a certain extent all my sister house- 
keepers ?" With this thought in mind, I used my list of meals as a 
basis, changing and improving it so as to give the most varied and 
wholesome bill of fare possible at a moderate cost, choosing all my 
supplies at that season when they are most plentiful, therefore the 
cheapest and best. While the purse will give a ready answer to all 
pertaining to luxuries, I would make one suggestion, and it is an 
old one, that by using a cold frame, (a thing inexpensive in itself 
and requiring but little attention), anyone can have lettuce, radishes 
and green onions in the early spring months at a very small cost, 
while the same if bought, would be expensive luxuries. 

The meals follow each other in such a manner that there shall 
be no waste, hence a great many dainty and appetizing dishes 
appear in my menu which at first glance would impress one as 
both unnecessary and extravagant, while they are really made out 
of the left overs which are so often thrown aside or left to spoil. 

If a family serves late dinner then Monday's tea must we used 
for Tuesday's lunch, etc. 

I believe this Bill of Fare to be strictly practical, having spent 
several years before I felt it was perfected, yet I do not expect 
those having it to follow it exactly, but to use it more as a book of 
reference, exercising their own individual taste in connection with 
it, and should like to hear from anyone having the book how it 
suited their family.

TO THE PUBLIC : 

We wish to announce to the patrons of the AinericaJi Gelati?ie 
Co. that we have purchased from E. E. McLeish & Co. all their 
right, title and thei?- secret process for manufacturing the American 
Gelatine. 

We propose to manufacture a pure article and to maintain the 
high standard of excellence and reputation that the American Gel- 
atine^ as manufactured heretofore by E. E. McLeish & Co., has 
acquired. 

By the E. E. McLeish & Co.'s process no sulphur, no sulphuric 
acid, or acid of any kind, or any deleterious ingredient whatever 
enters into the manufacture of the American Gelatine. 

By this process Gelatine is made a strictly pure, odorless and 
wholesome article, and we challenge a chemical analysis to find a 
particle of impure or deleterious substance in it. 

We claim that by this process we manufacture the purest, odor- 
less and most wholesome Gelatine in the world. 

Our goods will be manufactured under the careful supervision 
of an experienced person. No expense or attention will be spared 
in the manufacturing of these goods to keep up the high standard 
of excellence that they have attained. 

By strict attention to all the details in the production of these 
goods we hope to retain the patronage of the former patrons of the 
American Gelatine Co. 

Soliciting the extension of your patronage to us, we remain 

Respectfully yours, 

J. E. ROBINSON & CO., 

Successors to E. E. McLeish & Co. 

BUFFALO, M. Y.

LADIES. WE KNOW 

You do not mean to keep in the same rut your grand- 
mother's made. The world is moving. You do not 
cook by the old-fashioned crane nor even by the old 
brick oven. After you have used a modern 

(3a8 Cooking IRanoe, 

YOU WILL WONDER 

How you consented so long to be the slave of an 
ordinary cook stove. 

A Gas Range will give your bread, pies and cakes just exactly the shade of 
brown you desire, just as if you had used a paint brush, so perfect is the result. 
In broiling and roasting meat, all the juices are saved by a gas stove ; the same 
economy in fish. Toast is quickly browned to the desired shade, and all along 
the line the Gas Range is perfection for cooking purposes.

PREFACE. 



" Oh, Dear ! What shall we have to eat ?" What ^housekeeper 
has never been confronted with this tiresome and ever present 
question ? I have written this book hoping that it may be an ever 
ready answer to that wearisome interrogative. By setting down 
each day what was served on my own table, as a future reference 
to help me in deciding this every day puzzle, the thought occurred 
to me, "Why couldn't I help to a certain extent all my sister house- 
keepers ?" With this thought in mind, I used my list of meals as a 
basis, changing and improving it so as to give the most varied and 
wholesome bill of fare possible at a moderate cost, choosing all my 
supplies at that season when they are most plentiful, therefore the 
cheapest and best. While the purse will give a ready answer to all 
pertaining to luxuries, I would make one suggestion, and it is an 
old one, that by using a cold frame, (a thing inexpensive in itself 
and requiring but little attention), anyone can have lettuce, radishes 
and green onions in the early spring months at a very small cost, 
while the same if bought, would be expensive luxuries. 

The meals follow each other in such a manner that there shall 
be no waste, hence a great many dainty and appetizing dishes 
appear in my menu which at first glance would impress one as 
both unnecessary and extravagant, while they are really made out 
of the left overs which are so often thrown aside or left to spoil. 

If a family serves late dinner then Monday's tea must we used 
for Tuesday's lunch, etc. 

I believe this Bill of Fare to be strictly practical, having spent 
several years before I felt it was perfected, yet I do not expect 
those having it to follow it exactly, but to use it more as a book of 
reference, exercising their own individual taste in connection with 
it, and should like to hear from anyone having the book how it 
suited their family. 




The Mean Grystaiilzed Gelatine. 





TO THE PUBLIC : 

We wish to announce to the patrons of the American Gelatine 
Co. that we have purchased from E. E. McLeish & Co. all their 
right, title and their secret process for manufacturing the American 
Gelatine. 

We propose to manufacture a pure article and to maintain the 
high standard of excellence and reputation that the American Gel- 
a tine, as manufactured heretofore by E. E. McLeish & Co., has 
acquired. 

By the E. E. McLeish & Co.'s process no sulphur, no sulphuric 
acid, or acid of any kind, or any deleterious ingredient whatever 
enters into the manufacture of the American Gelatine. 

By this process Gelatine is made a strictly pure, odorless and 
wholesome article, and we challenge a chemical analysis to find a 
particle of impure or deleterious substance in it. 

We claim that by this process we manufacture the purest, odor- 
less and most wholesome Gelatine in the world. 

Our goods will be manufactured under the careful supervision 
of an experienced person. No expense or attention will be spared 
in the manufacturing of these goods to keep up the high standard 
of excellence that they have attained. 

By strict attention to all the details in the production of these 
goods we hope to retain the patronage of the former patrons of the 
American Gelatine Co. 

Soliciting the extension of your patronage to us, we remain 

Respectfully yours, 

J. E. ROBINSON & CO., 

Successors to E. E. McLeish & Co. 

BUFFALO, N. Y.

LADIES. WE KNOW 

You do not mean to keep in the same rut your grand- 
moiher's made. The world is moving. You do not 
cook by the old-fashioned crane nor even by the old 
brick oven. After you have used a modern 

(Sas Cooking IRange, 
YOU WILL WONDER 

How you consented so long to be the slave of an 
ordinary cook stove. 

A Gas Range will give jour bread, pies and cakes just exactly the shade of 
brown you desire, just as if you had used a paint brush, so perfect is the result. 
In broiling and roasting meat, all the juices are saved by a gas stove ; the same 
economy in fish. Toast is quickly browned to the desired shade, and all along 
the line the Gas Range is perfection for cooking purposes.
