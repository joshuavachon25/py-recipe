THE PURPOSE 

of this little book is to procure funds in aid of the 
farmers in that part of France which was devas- 
tated by the invasion of the German armies and 
subsequently regained by the French. 

This region, in part, one of the most fertile in 
France, and which sustained htmdreds of thousands 
of inhabitants engaged in agricultural pursuits, 
has been left desolate, with all buildings destroyed 
and all farming implements, cattle, and farm pro- 
ducts taken ofE by the invaders for military uses. 

Its old men, women, and children, who survived 
the slaughter of invasion, are now imdertaking the 
labour of restoring their farms. To help in the 
supply of seeds, farm implements, and other simple 
but essential means of enabling these suffering 
people to regain by their own efforts the necessaries 
of life, the compilers offer to the public this book 
on Cookery. 

Its proceeds will be distributed by Le Secours 
National, of France, whose effective organization 
assures its best and most helpful disposition.

information from any one wishing fiirther to 
support this cause.

Mrs. Wm. Lynde Harrison, 
Miss G. Clergue. 

Mesdames : 

Vous desirez faire quelque chose pour venir en 
aide aiix victimes de la guerre en France et, dans 
ce but, vous publiez un livre utile dont vous faites 
tous les frais d' impression de maniere a ce que le 
produit total de la vente soit verse au Comite de 
Secours National de Paris. 

Le but que vous vous proposez est fort louable 
car les besoins sont grands au pays de France. 
On a fait demierement le recensement des refugies 
beiges et frangais chasses de leurs demeures et 
recueillis dans les di verses communes de France, 
lis sont plus de 900,000 et les allemands ont ren- 
voy6 en France par la voie de la Suisse plus de 
100,000 prisonniers — vieillards, femmes et enfants 



6 Allied CooKery 

— qu'ils ne voulaient plus nourrir et qui ont 6t6 

rendus, denues de tout, a la charite publique. 
Tous ces malheureux doivent etre vetus de la tete 
aux pieds. Les Etats-Unis et le Canada ont heu- 
reusement fait leur part pour soulager cette grande 
infortune, grace aux appels reiteres de T American 
Relief Clearing House de Paris et de New- 
York et des divers comites canadiens du Secours 
National de Paris, organises par le Comite France- 
Amerique. 

Les hopitaux frangais reclament aussi, a bon 
droit, notre sollicitude, car c'est la France qui 
supporte le plus fort de I'assaut teuton sur la 
frontiere de T Quest et ses blesses doivent depasser 
le demi million. Devant cette grande detresse la 
Croix-Rouge americaine et la Croix-Rouge cana- 
dienne ne sont pas demeurees indifferentes et des 
milliers de caisses ont ete envoyees aux hopitaux 
frangais. Malheureusement la liste des calamites 
qui ont fondu sur la France ne s^arrete pas Id: 
tout le territore envahi par les troupes allemandes, 
dont elles ont ete chassees, qui va de la Mame a 
TAisne, et que couvraient des centaines de vil- 
lages prosperes dans une des regions les plus fertiles 
et les plus riches de la France, a ete ravage par les 
troupes ennemies. Les proprietaires de ces milliers 
de fermes — vieillards, femmes et enfant s — sont 
revenus a leurs foyers detruits pour relever leurs

maisons et faire produire a la terre la nourriture 
dont ils ont besoin. lis ont tout perdu: maisons, 
meubles, vetements, animaux, instruments ara- 
toires. Ce sont ces demiers qui attirent particu- 
lierement votre commiseration. En face de cette 
misere effroyable tous les coeurs s'emeuvent et 
chacun veut apporter son aide a ces braves gens. 
Vous donnez au public ime occasion facile et 
agreable de faire ce geste en mettant a sa portee un 
livre interessant dont le prix ira soulager les nobles 
victimes de la guerre en France. 

Je vous souhaite ime forte recette. Veuillez 
agreer, mesdames, avec mes felicitations, Texpres- 
sion de mes sentiments distingues.

ALLIED FOOD 

As soon as I heard of the proposed plan of this 
book I became positively frantic to co-operate 
in it. The idea of a cookery book which should 
contain Allied Recipes and Allied Recipes only, 
struck me at once as one of the finest ideas of 
the day. 

For myself I have felt for some time past 
that the time is gone, and gone for ever, when 
I can eat a German Pretzel or a Wiener 
Schnitzel. 

It gives me nothing but remorse to remember 
that there were days when I tolerated, I may 
even say I enjoyed, Hungarian Goulash. I could 
not eat it now. As for Bulgarian Boosh or Tur- 
kish Tch'kk, the mere names of them make me 
ill. 

For me, for the rest of my Hfe, it must be Allied 
Food or no food at all. One may judge, therefore, 
with what delight I received the news of this 
patriotic enterprise. I at once telegraphed to 
the editors the following words: 



Allied CooKery 9 

''Am willing to place at your service without 
charge entire knowledge of cookery. Forty-six 
years' practical experience." 

To this telegram I received no reply. I am 
aware that there is, even in cooking circles, a cer- 
tain amount of professional jealousy. It may be 
that I had overpassed the line of good taste in 
offering my entire knowledge. I should have only 
offered part of it. 

I therefore resolved that instead of writing the 
whole book as I had at first intended, I would con- 
tent myself with sending to the editors, a certain 
number of selected recipes of a kind calculated to 
put the book in a class all by itself. 

I sent, in all, fifty recipes. I regret to say that 
after looking over the pages of the book with 
the greatest care, and after looking also on the 
back of them, I do not find my recipes included 
in it. The obvious conclusion is that while this 
book was in the press my recipes were stolen out 
of it. 

The various dishes that I had selected were of 
so distinctive a character and the art involved in 
their preparation so entirely recherche that it 
seems a pity that they should be altogether lost. 
They contained a certain je ne sais quoi which 
would have marked them out as emphatically 
the perquisite of the few. To say that they 



lo Allied CooKery 

were dishes for a king is to understate the fact. 

It is therefore merely in the pubHc interest and 
from no sense of personal vanity that I reproduce 
the substance of one or two of them in this preface. 
There was a whole section, for example, on Eggs, 
which I am extremely loath to lose. It showed how 
by holding an egg down under boiling water till it 
is exhausted, it may be first cooked and then be 
passed under a flat iron until it becomes an Egg 
Pancake. It may be then given a thin coat of 
varnish and served in a railway restaurant for 
years and years. 

I had also an excellent recipe for Rimi Omelette. 
It read: "Take a dipper full of rum and insert an 
omelette in it. Serve anywhere in Ontario.** I 
am convinced that this recipe alone would have 
been worth its weight in nmi. 

But it would be childish of me to lay too much 
stress on my own personal disappointment or regret. 
When I realized what had happened I felt at once 
that my co-operation in this book must take some 
other form. I therefore sent to the editors a 
second telegram which read: 

'*Am willing to eat free of charge all dishes 
contained in volume." 

This offer was immediately accepted, and I am 
happy to assure readers of this book that I have 
eaten each and every one of the preparations in the 



Allied CooKery il 

pages that follow. To prevent all doubt I make 
this statement under oath. I had intended to 
make merely an honest statement of the fact 
but my friends tell me that a statement under 
oath is better in such a case than a mere honest 
statement. 



Stt^A^ ^^^coc/C^ 



FOREWORD 

God what a world ! if men in street and mart 
Felt that same impulse of the human heart 
Which makes them in the hour of flame and flood 
Rise to the meaning of true Brotherhood ! 

The heart of the world throbs with sympathy 
for the suffering women and children in the war- 
devastated countries of Europe. He who does not 
long to be a helper in this hour of vast need and 
unprecedented anguish must be made of something 
more adamant than stone. America owes a large 
debt to the culinary artists of Europe. Without 
their originality and finished skill, in the creation 
of savory dishes for the table, the art of enter- 
taining in our land could never have attained its 
present perfection. 

Ever ready to incorporate in her own methods 
whatever other countries had to offer as improve- 
ments, America has received from the epicurean 
chefs of Europe conspicuous benefits . In every menu 
from coast to coast, these facts make themselves 
evident. It is then fitting, that at this crucial 
hour, we repay something of the debt we owe by 

12 



A.llied CooKery 



13 



making this little cooking manual an instant and 
decided success, knowing the proceeds from its 
sale will relieve such distress as we in our sheltered 
homes can scarcely picture by the greatest effort 
of imagination. 

Our souls should be vessels receiving 
The waters of love for relieving 

The sorrows of men. 
For here lies the pleasure of living : 
In taking God's bounties and giving 

The gifts back again.

BOUILLABAISSE 

(The national dish of Marseille) 

Indeed, a rich and savory stew 'tis; 

And true philosophers, methinks, 
Who love all sorts of natural beauties, 

Should love good victuals and good drinks. 
And Cordelier or Benedictine 

Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace, 
Nor find a fast day too afflicting. 

Which served him up a Bouillabaisse. 

Thackeray. 

Cut off the best parts of 3 mediiim-sized flounders 
and 6 butterfish and put them aside ; the remaining 
parts of the fish — skin, bones, heads, etc. — boil in 
water 20 minutes; this should make i quart of 
fish stock when strained. 

Put 3 tablespoons of olive oil in stew-pan, add 

4 chopped onions, 3 cloves of chopped garlic, a 

15 



i6 Allied CooKery 

few sprigs of parsley, i bayleaf , X teaspoon fennel, 
yi teaspoon saffron, yi teaspoon whole black 
pepper ground, salt, fry until golden brown. Then 
add 3 or 4 tomatoes and a pimento, Yz quart of 
white wine, Yz quart of water, boil 15 minutes. 
Strain and return to the kettle; add the flounder 
and butterfish in pieces as large as possible, }4. lb. 
of codfish tongues, i lb. of eel; boil 10 minutes, add 
the fish stock, i lb. of scallops, boil 10 more minutes. 
Rub together i oz. of flour and i oz. of butter; drop 
this in the soup in little balls five minutes before 
serving. Then put in yi lb. of shrimps and i large 
boiled lobster cut in large pieces. Rub with garlic 
some round slices of bread and serve the Bouil- 
labaisse on them. 

This will serve 12 persons. 

One is not able to obtain here the varieties of 
fish of the Midi, but the above will make an excel- 
ent substitute. 

BORCHT 

(Russian) 

flDake a clear, light-coloured, highly seasoned 
stock of beef and veal or of chicken. Strain and 
remove all fat. A Russian gourmet will say that 
really good Borcht should be made with 2 ducks 
and a chicken in the stock. Cut up some red 
beets and boil them in the stock; about 4 large 



Allied CooKery 17 

beets to 8 cups of stock. When the beets are 
cooked squeeze in enough lemon-juice to give it a 
slightly acid flavour, then clear by stirring in the 
whipped white of an egg and bringing it to the 
boiling point. Strain carefully. . Serve in cups 
with a spoonful of sour cream. If the colour fails 
to be bright red, a few drops of vegetable colouring 
may be added. 

MUSHROOM SOUP 

(French) 

ZThree-quarters lb. of fresh mushrooms, i cup of 
water, 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of 
flour, 4 cups of scalded milk, ^ cup of cream, a 
few gratings of nutmeg, salt, and pepper. 

Put the mushrooms in a stew-pan with i table- 
spoon of butter, a few gratings of nutmeg, salt, 
and pepper, and i cup of water; cook over a good 
fire 20 minutes, then pass through a coarse sieve. 
Cream i tablespoon of butter with 2 tablespoons 
of flour, add this to 4 cups of scalded milk. When 
this thickens to a thin cream, add the mushrooms ; 
just before serving add ^2 cup of cream. 

SERBIAN CHICKEN SOUP 

Cut a fowl in four or five pieces. Put in a kettle 
with about one quart of water to each pound of 
fowl. When half cooked add salt and a carrot, 



1 8 Allied CooKery 

parsnip, some celery and parsley, an onion, and a 
few whole black peppers. 

In a separate pan put a tablespoon of lard and yi 
tablespoon of flour. Stir this until it is brown 
and add some paprika, according to taste. Add 
this to the soup. Let it boil a few minutes. Just 
before serving the soup stir in well the yolk of an 
^gg beaten with three tablespoons of cream. 

VEGETABLE SOUP 

(Minestrone alia Milanese) 

One-half quart of stock, 2 slices of lean pork, 
or a ham bone; 2 tomatoes, fresh or canned; i cup 
of rice, 2 tablespoons of dried beans, i tablespoon of 
peas, fresh or canned ; 2 onions. 

Put into the stock the slices of pork, cut into 
small pieces; or, if desired, a ham bone may be 
substituted for the pork. Add the tomatoes, cut 
into small pieces also, the onions, in small pieces, 
and the rice. Boil all together until the rice is 
cooked. Then add the beans and the peas and 
cook a little longer. The soup is ready when it is 
thick. If desired, this chowder can be made with 
fish broth instead of the stock, and with the addi- 
tion of shrimps which have been taken from their 
shells. 

This dish can be served hot or cold. 



Allied CooKery 19 

LETTUCE SOUP 

(Zuppa di Lattuga) 

One small lettuce, meat stock, 2 potatoes, the 
leaves of a head of celery, 2 tablespoons of peas, 
fresh or canned, i heaping tablespoon of flour. 

Put the potatoes, cold boiled, into the stock when 
it boils, add the celery leaves, the lettuce chopped 
up, the peas, and the flour mixed well with a little 
cold stock or water. Boil for one hour and a half, 
and serve with little squares of fried bread. 

POT-AU-FEU 

(French family soup) 

llngredients. — 4. lbs. of brisket of beef, the legs 
and neck of a fowl, }4 a cabbage, 2 leeks, i large 
onion, 2 carrots, a bouquet-gami (parsley, thyme, 
bay-leaf), i dessert-spoonful of chopped parsley, 
4 cloves, 12 peppercorns, i tablespoonful of 
salt, }/2 lb. of French bread, 6 quarts of cold 
water. 

Put the meat and water into a stock-pot or 
boiling pot ; let it come gently to boiling point, and 
skim well. Wash and clean the vegetables, stick 
the cloves in the onion, tie up the cabbage and leeks, 
and put all in with the meat. Add the carrots cut 
into large pieces, the bouquet-garni, peppercorns, 
and salt, and let the whole simmer gently for 4 



20 Allied CooKery 

hours. Just before serving cut the bread into thin 
slices, place them in a soup tureen, and add some 
of the carrot, leeks, and onions cut into small pieces. 
Remove the meat from the pot, season the broth to 
taste, and strain it into the soup tureen. Sprinkle 
the chopped parsley on the top, and serve. The 
meat and remaining vegetables may be served as 
a separate course; they may also be used up in 
some form for another meal. Or the meat and 
vegetables may be served and the broth put aside 
and used on the following day as '' Croute-au-pot. " 

ONION SOUP 

(Soupe k rOignon) 

Slice or chop two medium-sized onions; let them 
colour an instant in i oz. of butter; add a table- 
spoonful of fiotir; make a brown thickening. The 
onions must on no account be allowed to burn. 
Add 2>^ quarts of water, salt, and a pinch of 
pepper; stir on the fire until it boils; let it cook five 
minutes. Cut some slices of bread very fine (like 
a leaf) ; dry them in an open oven. Place in the 
tureen a layer of bread, a layer of grated cheese, 
until the tureen is half full. Pass the soup through 
a sieve into the tureen. Allow a few minutes to 
well soak the bread; at the same time the soup 
must not be allowed to get cold. If onions are not 
objected to do not strain them off.

SOLDIERS' SOUP 

(Soupe a la Bataille) 

TKHash well and chop fine a small white cabbage

take out the onion and herbs, taste if sufficiently 
seasoned ; mix the blood with a teacupf ul of thick 
cream, throw over the hare; shake the stew-pan 
briskly to allow all to mix well, but it must not 
boil; at the last moment add the liver, which has 
been sliced and sauted (shaken) for two minutes 
in hot butter over the fire. Arrange in an entree 
dish, pour the sauce over and garnish round with 
croutons of fried bread. 

Note. — This dish may be rendered more highly 
flavoured, if desired, by steeping the pieces of hare 
for some hours in the following marinade or pickle: 
a bottle of red wine, a cupful of vinegar, salt, 
pepper, a bouquet of herbs, and an onion stuck with 
cloves. Leave the hare in this preparation four or 
five hours, then when the thickening is made, put 
in the hare with this marinade, then the stock, and 
finish as above. Small button onions or mush- 
rooms may be added before the hare is tender; if

stock, cayenne pepper, and a very little curry 
powder; put the lid on the stew-pan, and set the 
rice to boil, or rather simmer, very gently over a

Cut up your rabbit into neat pieces, removing as 
much of the bone as possible. Have an iron sauce- 
pan ready, in which you have put a good quarter 
of a pound of fat bacon. Put in your pieces of 
rabbit, which you fry until they become a nice 
golden brown, and which the French call dore; just 
before they are this colour add 2 tablespoonsful of 
rimi, or of cognac, according to taste, also 2

must see do not bum.

bouillon, or gravy. Into this put what you have 
already pounded up and mix it in, then pass it all 
through a sieve (passoire). When ready pour it 
over the pieces of rabbit, now that they are become 
of a golden colour, and let it simmer with them in a 
covered saucepan by the side of the fire for a good 
two hours and more, so as to have it very tender. 
Salt and pepper to taste. Bouquet garni — ^which 
means thyme, and if one likes the flavour, a leaf 
of bay laurel — but for the latter just to let it be in 
an instant only, as it has such a strong flavour. 
Many prefer just the thyme, which is more delicate. 
Half an hour before the rabbit is cooked, add a good 
spoonful of vinegar' ; two, should the vinegar not be 
strong. Add a piece of butter of the size of a wal- 
nut whilst it is simmering or stewing by the side of

Curries 

INDIAN CURRY 

fIDost of the curry powder or paste to be found 
in this part of the world is a mixture of ^ of 
dried chilli, }i coriander, J^ dagatafolum; but 
the native curry cook uses a much larger variety 
of spices and likes to grind them himself fresh daily 
between two stones. The spices commonly used 
are: 

Red chilli (roasted) Scraped cocoanut 

Coriander seed (roasted) Dagatafolum 

** '' (fresh) Caraway seed 

Cinnamon Yellow pimentos 

Nutmeg Red pimentos 

Baked garlic Cardamon seeds 
Curcuma (saffron root) 

A FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN 

(Ceylon style) 

Cut 2 good-sized chickens in 8 pieces. Season 

with salt and pepper; put in a saucepan with 

about I quart of cocoanut milk ; add to this a little 

52 



A.llied CooKery 53 

cinnamon, yi teaspoon fresh coriander, X tea- 
spoon of powdered saffron, a little red pimento, and 
boil until tender; at the last minute thicken the 
sauce with 4 yolks of eggs mixed well with yi pint 
cocoanut cream; keep hot but do not boil, as the 
richness of the ingredients would make it curdle. 
As this curry is not hot it is served with a sambo 
which consists of small dishes on one tray con- 
taining such savories as plain scraped cocoanut, 
pimento paste, and chopped onion with a red 
pepper sauce. 

To obtain cocoanut cream, use the same process 
as that for ordinary cream ; — as for the milk : have 
3 fresh cocoanuts scraped very fine to which you 
add 3 pints of water, stir together for a few mo- 
ments, then strain, let this milk stand for 3 hours 
to obtain the cream. 

A SIMPLER INDIAN CURRY 

®ne lb. of beef, mutton, fish, or vegetables, as 
desired. One tablespoon of curry powder, i heap- 
ing tablespoon of butter, i onion, ^ fresh cocoanut, 
juice of half a lemon, salt to taste. Curry powder 
to be mixed in 2 ozs. of water. Onion to be finely 
chopped. Cocoanut to be scraped and soaked in 
a teacup of boiling water, then squeezed, and the 
milk (or the liquid) to be put in the curry. First 



54 Allied CooKery 

cook the butter till it bubbles, put in the onion 
and let it brown, add the curry powder, and let 
that cook a few minutes; if it becomes too dry 
and sticks to the pan add a little hot water. 
Then put in the meat (raw), cut in small pieces, 
fish, or vegetables, and fry them, add salt, and if 
dry, add a little more water, let all simmer till 
meat is thoroughly done; when about half done, 
add the cocoanut milk and the lemon -juice. 

If not convenient to use the cocoanut milk, or- 
dinary milk can be used, and the mixture thickened 
with a little flour. , Cocoanut milk thickens with- 
out flour. When the butter separates and shows 
itself in the gravy, the curry is ready for serving. 
Curry should be served with plain boiled rice. 
Pass rice first, then curry. 

If Indian chutney is served with curry it is a 
great addition. A banana may be cut up in pieces 
about half -inch thick, and added to the curry mix- 
ture while cooking, and is a pleasant addition to 
the flavour. 

ANOTHER CURRY SAUCE

Now take the cold Indian meal and cut it into 
squares about two inches across. Take a baking- 
dish of medium depth, butter well, then put in a 
layer of squares of Indian meal close together, to 
entirely cover the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle 
over it grated cheese; then pour on the top enough 
meat sauce to cover the layer (about 2 tablespoons) , 
then on the top of this add a layer of Bechamel 
sauce. Then put another layer of the squares 
of Indian meal, sprinkle with grated cheese as 
before, add meat sauce, then Bechamel sauce, and

of butter, when they come to the boiling point 
remove to the back of the stove. Use a large quan- 
tity of the syrup to the quantity of chestnuts. 
This syrup should diminish very slowly. When 
it has become very thick take out the chestnuts 
and drain them, add a little vanilla to the syrup. 
Now pour boiling water over the chestnuts to 
remove the syrup which covers them. Dry them 
well. Beat the thick syrup until it is opaque, then 
roll the dry chestnuts in it ; remove with a skimmer 
and let them dry on a sieve. 

Prunes may be treated in the same way.

horse-radish root, pour boiling water over them, 
and let stand 15 minutes; drain off, add yi cup 
of white mustard seed, a few whole cloves, and 
some cinnamon sticks. Then put all of this mix- 
ture on the pickles, cover them with boiling vine- 
gar, and put away. Two or three cloves of garlic 
put in the jar are an addition. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES

THE PURPOSE 

of this little book is to procure funds in aid of the 
farmers in that part of France which was devas- 
tated by the invasion of the German armies and 
subsequently regained by the French. 

This region, in part, one of the most fertile in 
France, and which sustained hundreds of thousands 
of inhabitants engaged in agricultural pursuits, 
has been left desolate, with all buildings destroyed 
and all farming implements, cattle, and farm pro- 
ducts taken off by the invaders for military uses. 

Its old men, women, and children, who survived 
the slaughter of invasion, are now undertaking the 
labour of restoring their farms. To help in the 
supply of seeds, farm implements, and other simple 
but essential means of enabling these suffering 
people to regain by their own efforts the necessaries 
of life, the compilers offer to the public this book 
on Cookery. 

Its proceeds will be distributed by Le Secours 
National, of France, whose effective organization 
assures its best and most helpful disposition.

An acknowledgment must be made for the kind 
assistance of friends in securing desirable recipes. 
There are some that will be novel to many house- 
holds, and all of them will give satisfaction when 
exactly followed. 

The compilers will gladly answer requests for 
information from any one wishing further to 
support this cause.

Mrs. Wm. Lynde Harrison, 
Miss G. Clergue. 

Mesdames : 

Vous d6sirez faire quelque chose pour venir en 
aide aux victimes de la guerre en France et, dans 
ce but, vous publiez un livre utile dont vous faites 
tous les frais d'impression de manidre k ce que le 
produit total de la vente soit vers6 au Comit6 de 
Secours National de Paris. 

Le but que vous vous proposez est fort louable 
car les besoins sont grands au pays de France. 
On a fait demierement le recensement des r6fugies 
beiges et frangais chassis de leurs demeures et 
recueillis dans les diverses communes de France, 
lis sont plus de 900,000 et les allemands ont ren- 
v©y6 en France par la voie de la Suisse plus de 
100,000 prisonniers — ^vieillards, femmes et enfants 



6 Allied CooKeiy 

— qu'ils ne voulaient plus nourrir et qui ont 6t6 
rendus, d6nu6s de tout, d la charit6 publique. 
Tous ces malheureux doivent 6tre v^tus de la t6te 
aux pieds. Les Etats-Unis et le Canada ont heu- 
reusement fait leur part pour soulager cette grande 
infortune, gr^ce aux appels r6it6r6s de 1' American 
Relief Clearing House de Paris et de New- 
York et des divers comites canadiens du Secours 
National de Paris, organis6s par le Comit6 France- 
Am6rique. 

Les hdpitaux frangais r^clament aussi, k bon 
droit, notre soUicitude, car c'est la France qui 
supporte le plus fort de I'assaut teuton sur la 
frontidre de I'Ouest et ses blesses doivent d6passer 
le demi million. Devant cette grande d^tresse la 
Croix-Rouge americaine et la Croix-Rouge cana- 
dienne ne sont pas demeur^es indiff^rentes et des 
milliers de caisses ont 6te envoyees aux h6pitaiix 
frangais. Malheureusement la liste des calamit^s 
qui ont fondu sur la Prance ne s'arr^te pas 1^: 
tout le territore envahi par les troupes allemandes, 
dont elles ont 6t6 chass^es, qui va de la Mame d 
I'Aisne, et que couvraient des centaines de vil- 
lages prosp6res dans une des regions les plus fertiles 
et les plus riches de la France, a 6t6 ravage par les 
troupes ennemies. Les propri6taires de ces milliers 
de fermes — vieillards, femmes et enfants — sont 
revenus k leurs foyers d6truits pour relever leurs 



Allied CooKery 7 

maisons et faire produire k la terre la nourriture 
dont ils ont besoin. lis ont tout perdu: maisons, 
meubles, v^tements, animaux, instniments ara- 
toires. Ce sont ces derniers qui attirent particu- 
lidrement votre commiseration. En face de cette 
mis^re eflfroyable tous les coeurs s'^meuvent et 
chacun veut apporter son aide k ces braves gens. 
Vous donnez au public une occasion facile et 
agr§able de faire ce geste en mettant k sa port^e un 
livre int6ressant dont le prix ira soulager les nobles 
victimes de la guerre en France. 

Je vous souhaite tme forte recette. Vetiillez

ALLIED FOOD 

As soon as I heard of the proposed plan of this 
book I became positively frantic to co-operate 
in it. The idea of a cookery book which should 
contain Allied Recipes and Allied Recipes only, 
struck me at once as one of the finest ideas of 
the day. 

For myself I have felt for some time past 
that the time is gone, and gone for ever, when 
I can eat a German Pretzel or a Wiener 
Schnitzel. 

It gives me nothing but remorse to remember 
that there were days when I tolerated, I may 
even say I enjoyed, Hungarian Goulash. I could 
not eat it now. As for Bulgarian Boosh or Tur- 
kish Tch'kk, the mere names of them make me 
ill. 

For me, for the rest of my life, it must be Allied 
Food or no food at all. One may judge, therefore, 
with what delight I received the news of this 
patriotic enterprise. I at once telegraphed to 
the editors the following words: 



^lliecl CooKery 9 

"Am willing to place at your service without 
charge entire knowledge of cookery. Forty-six 
years' practical experience." 

To this telegram I received no reply. I am 
aware that there is, even in cooking circles, a cer- 
tain amount of professional jealousy. It may be 
that I had overpassed the line of good taste in 
offering my entire knowledge. I should have only 
offered part of it. 

I therefore resolved that instead of writing the 
whole book as I had at first intended, I would con- 
tent myself with sending to the editors, a certain 
number of selected recipes of a kind calculated to 
put the book in a class all by itself. 

I sent, in all, fifty recipes. I regret to say that 
after looking over the pages of the book with 
the greatest care, and after looking also on the 
back of them, I do not find my recipes included 
in it. The obvious conclusion is that while this 
book was in the press my recipes were stolen out 
of it. 

The various dishes that I had selected were of 
so distinctive a character and the art involved in 
their preparation so entirely recherchS that it 
seems a pity that they should be altogether lost. 
They contained a certain je ne sais quoi which 
would have marked them out as emphatically 
the perquisite of the few. To say that they 



lo Allied CooKery 

were dishes for a king is to understate the fact. 

It is therefore merely in the pubHc interest and 
from no sense of personal vanity that I reproduce 
the substance of one or two of them in this preface. 
There was a whole section, for example, on Eggs, 
which I am extremely loath to lose. It showed how 
by holding an egg down under boiling water till it 
is exhausted, it may be first cooked and then be 
passed tinder a fiat iron until it becomes an Egg 
Pancake. It may be then given a thin coat of 
varnish and served in a railway restaurant for 
years and years. 

I had also an excellent recipe for Rum Omelette. 
It read : " Take a dipper full of rum and insert an 
omelette in it. Serve anywhere in Ontario." I 
am convinced that this recipe alone would have 
been worth its weight in rum. 

But it would be childish of me to lay too much 
stress on my own personal disappointrnent or regret. 
When I realized what had happened I felt at once 
that my co-operation in this book must take some 
other form. I therefore sent to the editors a 
second telegram which read: 

"Am willing to eat free of charge all dishes 
contained in volume." 

This offer was immediately accepted, and I am 
happy to assure readers of this book that I have 
eaten each and every one of the preparations in the

pages that follow. To prevent all doubt I make 
this statement under oath. I had intended to 
make merely an honest statement of the fact 
but my friends tell me that a statement under 
oath is better in such a case than a mere honest 
statement.

FOREWORD 

God what a world! if men in street and mart 
Felt that same impulse of the human heart 
Which makes them in the hour of flame and flood 
Rise to the meaning of true Brotherhood! 

The heart of the world throbs with sympathy 
for the suffering women and children in the war- 
devastated countries of Europe. He who does not 
long to be a helper in this hour of vast need and 
unprecedented anguish must be made of something 
more adamant than stone. America owes a large 
debt to the culinary artists of Europe. Without 
their originality and finished skill, in the creation 
of savory dishes for the table, the art of enter- 
taining in our land could never have attained its 
present perfection. 

Ever ready to incorporate in her own methods 
whatever other countries had to offer as improve- 
ments, America has received from the epicurean 
chefs of Europe conspicuous benefits . In every menu 
from coast to coast, these facts make themselves 
evident. It is then fitting, that at this crucial 
hour, we repay something of the debt we owe by

making this little cooking manual an instant and 
decided success, knowing the proceeds from its 
sale will relieve such distress as we in our sheltered 
homes can scarcely picture by the greatest effort 
of imagination. 

Our souls should be vessels receiving 
The waters of love for relieving 

The sorrows of men. 
For here lies the pleasure of living: 
In taking God's bounties and giving 

The gifts back again.

BOUILLABAISSE 

(The national dish of Marseille) 

Indeed, a rich and savory stew 'tis; 

And true philosophers, methinks, 
Who love all sorts of natural beauties. 

Should love good victuals and good drinks. 
And Cordelier or Benedictine 

Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace, 
Nor find a fast day too afflicting. 

Which served him up a Bouillabaisse.

with a wooden spoon, until it boils ; the sauce should 
cover the meat and not be too thick ; add a bouquet 
of herbs, an onion with cloves in it. Cover the 
stew-pan and leave it to stew until the hare is 
tender. A young hare will take from an hour and 
a quarter to an hour and a half, an old one may 
cook for three hours without becoming tender. 
The sauce should by this time be reduced to half; 
take out the onion and herbs, taste if sufficiently 
seasoned ; mix the blood with a teacupful of thick 
cream, throw over the hare; shake the stew-pan 
briskly to allow all to mix well, but it must not 
boil; at the last moment add the liver, which has

" " (fresh) Caraway seed

boil until tender; at the last minute thicken the 
sauce with 4 yoUcs of eggs mixed well with j4 pint 
cocoanut cream; keep hot but do not boil, as the 
richness of the ingredients would make it curdle. 
As this curry is not hot it is served with a sambo 
which consists of small dishes on one tray con- 
taining such savories as plain scraped cocoanut, 
pimento paste, and chopped onion with a red 
pepper sauce. 

To obtain cocoanut cream, use the same process 
as that for ordinary cream; — ^as for the milk: have 
3 fresh cocoanuts scraped very fine to which you 
add 3 pints of water, stir together for a few mo- 
ments, then strain, let this milk stand for 3 hours

milk (or the liquid) to be put in the curry. First 



54 Allied CooKery 

cook the butter till it bubbles, put in the onion 
and let it brown, add the curry powder, and let 
that cook a few minutes; if it becomes too dry 
and sticks to the pan add a little hot water. 
Then put in the meat (raw), cut in small pieces, 
fish, or vegetables, and fry them, add salt, and if 
dry, add a little more water, let all simmer till 
meat is thoroughly done; when about half done, 
add the cocoanut milk and the lemon-juice. 

If not coruvenient to use the cocoanut milk, or- 
dinary milk can be used, and the mixture thickened 
with a Uttle flour. Cocoanut milk thickens with- 
out flour. When the butter separates and shows 
itself in the gravy, the curry is ready for serving. 
Curry should be served with plain boiled rice. 
Pass rice first, then curry. 

If Indian chutney is served with curry it is a

other round the pan. The latter must be well 
buttered before putting in the lettuces, or in place 
of butter some very good gravy from which all 
grease has been taken. Add stock to half the 
height of the lettuces; cover and cook them gently 
for an hour. The lettuces should be tender and the 
liquid much reduced. 

Note. — Lettuces may be cooked in the same
