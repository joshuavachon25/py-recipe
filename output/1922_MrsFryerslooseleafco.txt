COOKING means the knowledge of Medea, and of Circe, and 
of Calypso, and of Helen, and of Rebekah, and of the Queen 
of Sheba. It means the knowledge of all herbs, and fruits, and 
balms, and spices; and of all that is healing and sweet in fields 
and groves, and savory in meats; it means carefulness, and invent- 
iveness, and watchfulness, and willingness, and readiness of appli- 
ance; it means the economy of your great-grandmothers and the 
science of modern chemists; it means much tasting, and no wasting; 
it means English thoroughness, and French art, and Arabian 
hospitality; it means, in fine, that you are to be perfectly and 
always, ladies (loaf givers); and, as you are to see, imperatively, 
that everybody has something pretty to put on, so you are to see, 
yet more imperatively, that everybody has something good to eat.

PREFACE 

lively and intense interest now displayed everywhere in 
the art of cookery, which is at once the most ancient and 
the most modern of the arts, marks such an advance over the 
pioneer days of domestic science as only a teacher of that subject, 
or an experienced housekeeper who has kept step with the march 
of progress, can fully appreciate. The increasing knowledge of 
food materials and the work they perform in the body, the constant 
study of the principles of nutrition and of the causes of malnutri- 
tion, the many inventions and labor-saving devices of the present- 
day kitchen, the eagerness to try new methods and the willingness 
to adopt them when proved to be better, the desire to work with 
intelligence rather than by "the rule of thumb" all these are 
signs of the times indicating that domestic science is assuming an 
importance in our social fabric which augurs well for the future 
health and happiness of the American home. For those who wish 
to understand the "whys" of cookery and who does not? it is 
believed that the chapters in this book treating of the principles 
of cookery, the balanced ration, diet for weight control, school 
lunches, and kindred topics, will be found especially helpful. 

As to the recipes themselves, they have stood the tests of experi- 
ment and experience, and unless too many liberties are taken with 
them, they will bring the success every cook desires. They are as 
economical as consistent with wise selection and the variety which 
is the spice of appetite; and are planned for a family of four, 
because four seems to be the average number today. They can 
readily be divided by two for a family of two; multiplied by three- 
fourths for a family of three; multiplied by one-and-a-half for a 
family of six; or doubled for a family of eight. Some articles, 
like cakes, will serve more than four, but they will keep for several 
days, and are better made by the four-in-family measure.

PREFACE 

Every home-loving woman loves new recipes, and gathers them 
from all sources, begging them from friends, clipping them from 
magazines and newspapers, and pigeon-holing them in her kitchen 
cabinet or her desk for future use too often having the vexatious 
experience of being imable to trace their whereabouts when 
wanted; or she places them between the pages of her cook book, 
until the overstrained binding, having reached the limit of endur- 
ance, bursts, and but who need be told? The Invisible Loose- 
Leaf Binding Device has made the Loose-Leaf Cook Book possible, 
and it brings to you a method of keeping your cook book up to date. 
As the binding device admits of extension, memoranda and per- 
sonal recipes can be added at pleasure, so that your cook book 
will become increasingly valuable as a record of your own house- 
keeping experience. 

Acknowledgment is here made of the able assistance of Miss 
Helen Cramp, and of Miss Ada Z. Fish, in the preparation of 
the recipes; and of the kindness of other friends who have con- 
tributed their favorite recipes; especially of the courtesy of The 
Ladies' Home Journal for the use of illustrations which originally 
appeared in the pages of that magazine. The data and tables 
in regard to food values in this book are based chiefly on material 
furnished by the very helpful and instructive publications issued 
from time to time by the United States Government.

PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY

The knowledge of science which is attainable by mere reading, 
though infinitely better than ignorance, is knowledge of a very differ- 
ent kind from that which arises from direct contact with fact.

PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY 

IN the days of our grandmothers, a woman who knew how to 
tempt the appetite with the richest and newest viands was 
accounted a good cook; but today the cook who deserves such a 
happy title must not only know how to appeal to the appetite, 
she must also understand what the human body needs, what foods 
are best adapted to its use, and how to prepare these foods in 
kind and quantity to meet its requirements. 

The cook who understands these things and does them is entitled 
to be called a good cook in the truest sense of the term. She 
realizes that health depends upon the food eaten, and that upon 
her shoulders, or rather in her hands, rests the welfare of her 
family and the nation; and she willingly assumes this Responsi- 
bility, knowing well what she is about. 

A serious matter then, is the planning of a day's meals; and 
scientists, realizing its importance, have in recent years devoted 
many hours of study and experiment to the principles of nutrition 
and nutritive food values. 

The Human Engine. The body has often been called a living 
engine, for it performs work and generates power. In other 
words, it is a living machine. All engines are run by the use of 
some kind of fuel. Coal, wood, gasoline and other substances are 
constantly fed to mechanical engines. Each type requires its 
own particular kind of fuel. In order to do its work properly, 
the human engine requires the right kind of fuel just as does any 
other engine. 

Food as Fuel; Other Uses. Food then is required by the body 
to supply heat and energy; but fuel foods are not the only kind 
required by the living mechanism, for the body is able to do what 
no man-made device is able to accomplish. When the parts 

3 I/-L 



PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY 



become worn out, the living system uses food to repair the wasted 
tissues and bony structure. Not only can the body do this; but 
that it uses food for growth is constantly manifest in the develop- 
ment of children. Therefore, tissue-building or repair foods are 
required as well as fuel foods. 

Wise Selection of Foods. It is very evident, therefore, that the 
person who plans the meals for the family should understand how 
to select wisely the foods which supply the needs of the human 
mechanism. Foods are grouped according to their nutritive uses 
into the following classes: Proteins, Fats, Carbohydrates, Mineral 
Matters.

e. g., fat of meat, butter, 

olive oil, oils of corn and 

wheat, etc. 
CARBOHYDRATES Are transformed into fat. 

e. g., sugar, starch, etc. 
MINERAL MATTERS (ASH) Share in forming bone, assist in digestion, etc 

e. g., phosphates of lime, potash, soda, etc. 



All serve as fuel to 
yield energy in the 
forms of heat and 
muscular power. 



PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY 



The Proteins form tissue and muscle for growth and repair. 
They are found in lean meat, white of eggs, gluten of wheat, curd 
of milk, beans, peas, etc. 

The Fats are either used as fuel foods or stored as fat. Examples 
are the fat of meats; the oils of corn, peanut, and olive, etc. 

The Carbohydrates, such as starch and sugar, are fuel foods. 

All three of the above, Protein, Fats, and Carbohydrates, serve 
as fuel to yield energy in the forms of heat and muscular power. 

The Mineral Matters (ash) share in forming bone and in acting as 
body regulators. They are found in fruits and in many vegetables. 

Water enters every tissue, regulates body temperature, and aids 
in the work accomplished by all other foods. 

In planning a day's meals, fuel foods, growth-and-repair foods, 
and mineral matters should be provided in correct proportion. 
This subject is further discussed in the chapter on Balanced 
Rations. 

Purpose of Cooking. The purpose of cooking foods is threefold : 
to increase their nutritive value and render them more digestible; 
to develop their flavors; and to safeguard health by destroying 
germs and parasites. 

Many vegetables are indigestible if uncooked; this is not only 
because their coarse cellular structure must be softened by cook- 
ing, but because most vegetables are made up largely of starch; 
and starch in its raw state cannot be appropriated by the body. 
Witness the pain caused by eating green apples, due to the presence 
of uncooked starch. In the case of the ripe fruit, the starch has 
been partially cooked by the heat of the sun's rays. Exposure 
to heat, as in boiling, causes the starch grains to swell and burst 
the hard outer coverings in which they are enclosed. The starches 
thus softened and released are converted during the digestive 
process into sugar, which the body so readily appropriates. 

If the starch grains are subjected to a greater degree of heat, 
as in baking, a greater a chemical change takes place which 
approaches the changes made during the process of digestion. For 
this reason, toasted and twice-baked breads are easily assimilated. 



PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY 



It follows, therefore, that starchy foods require thorough cook- 
ing. This does not mean, however, that all foods should be made 
very soft, nor that they should be predigested. The digestive 
system of a healthy person likes to do its own work, and both 
desires and requires a certain amount of bulk. This much-needed 
bulk is largely supplied by the cellulose, or fibre-structure of vege- 
tables, which has no nutritive value in itself, but has great mechan- 
ical value. In some forms it is not too coarse to be used uncooked, 
as in lettuce and celery; but as found in potatoes, the cereal 
grains, and in other combinations with starches, it needs to be 
softened by the cooking which renders the starch digestible. 

Cooking develops and intensifies the flavors which render food 
more appetizing, and therefore more digestible. This is particu- 
larly true of meats. Cooking also serves to destroy germs and 
parasites; and, in the case of meats, to break down their heavy 
muscular fibres and tough connective tissues. 

Albuminous Foods should be cooked at a low temperature. 
This refers principally to meats and eggs. Meats belong to the 
protein group of food, and contain much fibrin which closely 
resembles albumen. The simplest form of albumen is seen in the 
white of an egg. Heat hardens albumen, long exposure to intense 
heat rendering it almost insoluble, and therefore indigestible. For 
this reason eggs should be cooked at a low temperature; soups 
and broths likewise to extract the full flavor of the juices. Baked 
and roasted meats should first be exposed to intense heat, to sear 
the surface and thus prevent the rich juices from escaping. After 
a coating is formed, the balance of the cooking should be done at 
a low temperature. 

These two principles, thorough cooking for starchy foods, and 
low temperature for albuminous foods, are a key to the reasons 
for the various methods given in the chapters that follow. 

Different Methods of Cooking. Foods are cooked in their own 
juices, or by the use of water, or by the use of fats. 

Roasting, baking, broiling, and pan-broiling are examples of 
cooking foods in their own juices. 



PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY 



Roasting, which means cooking before a clear open fire with 
exposure to air, has practically gone out of use with the passing 
of the open fireplace for cooking, although gau/e-door ovens are 
a substitute. By roasting, the flavor is better developed, and the 
juices are better retained than by any other method of cooking 
meats. 

Baking, which means cooking in a closed oven, has largely taken 
the place of roasting. 

Broiling, or cooking on a grill over glowing coals, or exposed to 
gas flames, is the nearest to roasting of the methods of cooking 
now employed. Pan-broiling is cooking in a saute pan or spider 
without the use of either water or fat. 

Boiling, stewing, braising, and fricasseeing are various methods 
of cooking by use of water, and are explained in the chapter on 
"Meats," page 59. 

Frying and sauteing, methods of cooking by the use of fats or 
oils, are also explained on page 60. 

Measurements. On the last page of this book will be found 
tables of weights and measures. The standard measuring cup 
holds one-half pint, and all measurements are level. Fill measures 
more than full, then draw a knife across the top to level. Just 
as a skilled workman enjoys using good tools, so the good and 
intelligent cook enjoys having a well-equipped kitchen work-room. 
There is not only inspiration for the cook in such inexpensive 
conveniences as the transparent glass measuring cup, the handy 
nest of measuring spoons, the flexible kitchen spatula, the copper 
wire dish mop, the revolving egg-beater, and the potato-ricer,

but they have an additional value in stirring the intellectual 
curiosity of the younger members of the household, who absorb 
from these workman-like tools a new respect for the art of cookery, 
and not unfrequently manifest a desire to learn to use them. 

Marketing and Economy. The wise housekeeper does not market 
over the telephone except in emergency, but goes to the market 
herself. Her aim is to provide the food which her family needs; 
and to get the best returns for the money she spends. In order 
to provide the right kind and amount of food, she has made a 
study of foods, and of balanced rations; and in order to get the 
best returns for the money expended, she selects in person the food 
required, for she knows that the price she pays is no test of the 
nourishment the food will yield. The scarce article is not neces- 
sarily the article to be most desired. Strawberries on the table 
with snow on the windows are surely an extravagance. The expen- 
sive cuts of meat are expensive because there are only a few of 
them in each animal. Cheaper cuts, if cooked skilfully, yield as 
much nutriment, and will be fully as much relished. But it would 
be unwise to pay more for fuel for cooking a tougher cut of meat 
than was saved in the difference in the purchase price. The fire- 
less and steam cookers have practically solved this problem. No 
kitchen should be without one. In the use of the less tender ends 
of meat, and for "left-overs," a meat grinder is one of the best 
means of economy. 

It is often a foolish pride which prevents a housekeeper from 
saving. Get what you ask for. Do not accept substitutes. 
Help the Government Pure Food Laws by observing labels. 
These laws are a wonderful advance in bettering conditions. Keep 
a pad and pencil hanging in the kitchen for market memoranda. 
Do not purchase what you do not need because it is cheap. 

If practicing economy, avoid "package goods" because a goodly 
part of the price goes for the fancy wrappings. Where possible, 
buy by weight. 



ENTERTAINING

ENTERTAINING 

THE most formal of social functions is the formal dinner. 
The dignity of the occasion demands that everything be 
correct, the invitations issued long in advance, and the courses 
many and elaborate, as befitting the ceremonious affair. It is to 
be doubted if either guest or hostess finds the formal dinner 
comparable in enjoyment with the little, or informal dinner, for 
in this the true spirit of hospitality seeks its opportunity to charm. 
The courses are few as compared with the formal dinner, and all 
details have been thought out by the hostess with a consideration 
for the personality of her guests. 

The formal luncheon and the less formal breakfast differ sim- 
ilarly; although, of course, no luncheon is as ceremonious as the 
formal dinner. The most approved hour for the breakfast party 
is twelve o'clock, but it is sometimes placed as early as ten or 
eleven; and it may be said that this pleasing manner of gathering 
friends about one especially recommends itself in the summer time, 
when elaborate affairs are less attractive than in[the cooler seasons. 

Afternoon tea is continually becoming more popular, and for 
good reason. From its very simplicity, it is no tax on the hostess, 
and is a most welcome and restful break in the "busy -ness" of a 
busy day. At an "At Home" day, which may be a set day and 
hour at intervals throughout several weeks, a hostess receives 
many of her friends at one time, and although she owes each 
guest a call in return, she has the pleasure and satisfaction of 
being "in" when her friends call. 

The evening reception) may be an elaborate affair, if the occasion 
requires; but in its best estate it is a simple, informal way of 
introducing a pleasant visitor to one's circle of friends, or of 
honoring a noted musician, author, or other celebrity.

ENTERTAINING 



INVITATIONS 

As has been said, the dinner takes first rank among general 
entertainments and usually involves more or less formality. 
Invitations are sent out at least two weeks in advance, and should 
be answered immediately. The formal invitation is engraved; 
the guest's name, hour and date written in by hand, 

Mr. and Mrs. Henry B. Anderson 

request the pleasure of 
Mr. and Mrs. James Brown's 

company at dinner 
on Wednesday, April the fourteenth 

at eight o'clock. 
12 West Burton Place, 
March the thirty -first. 

For a less formal dinner a note in the first person may be sent : 
My dear Mrs. Brown: 

Will you and Mr. Brown dine with us informally on Thursday 
evening., January the eighteenth, at eight o'clock? 

Sincerely yours, 

Elizabeth Smith Anderson. 
12 West Burton Place, 
January the fourth. 

The dinner in this case may be quite as formal as that for which 
the third-person invitation was sent, and evening dress is required. 

For a very informal little dinner an unconventional note is sent 
a week or less before the date set; and dinner dress is not required. 

Invitations to luncheon are similar to those used for dinner, 
although, as the affair is generally less formal, the engraved invita- 
tion is much less frequently used. 

Invitations for afternoon or evening occasions vary according 
to the number of guests and the degree of formality. For small, 
informal affairs the hostess simply uses her visiting card (or one 
engraved a trifle larger), writing in the lower left-hand corner, 
"Cards," "Musicale," or whatever the entertainment is to be, 

12 L-L 



ENTERTAINING 



and under it the date and hour. She may write under her own 
name, "To meet Miss Mary Jones" if the entertainment is given 
in honor of Miss Jones. Often, however, the cordial little note 
of invitation is preferred by many, perhaps because it carries a 
more direct and personal appeal. It is a subtle compliment, 
sometimes well calculated to make a diffident invited guest feel 
that she is really wanted. 

The Formal Dinner Party 

For the large dinner party, guests are expected to arrive at the 
hour appointed, and courtesy does not demand that the hostess 
wait more than fifteen minutes for a tardy guest. 

Each gentleman finds on a tray in the dressing-room a small 
addressed envelope containing a card on which is written the 
name of the lady whom he is to escort to dinner, and "R" or 
"L" in one corner to indicate on which side of the table they are 
to sit. If he does not know the lady, the hostess should see that 
he is presented to her. 

Introductions 

The hostess stands near the door and receives the guests, 
making such introductions as are convenient. In general, the 
"roof introduction'* is considered sufficient especially at large 
dinners. Introductions, however, should be given wherever 
possible, for they make intercourse among one's guests easier. 

On the other hand, it is not considered good form for a hostess 
to interrupt a conversation between guests for the purpose of 
making an introduction, or to introduce a guest upon his entrance 
to more than one other at a time. 

In making introductions the names should be pronounced as 
distinctly as possible; nothing is more discourteous to one's 
guests than a muttered introduction. A certain deference is 
to be observed in regard to sex, age, and office or public position. 
The gentleman is always presented to the lady, the usual form 
being, "Mrs. Brown, allow me to present Mr. Smith: Mr. Smith, 
Mrs. Brown." In introducing two women, either may be pre- 
sented to the other, unless the difference in their ages is very 
evident, in which case the younger should be presented to the 
older. With regard to office or station, the presentation is made 
to the distinguished guest, thus: "Governor Clark, allow me to 
present Mr. Newton: Mr. Newton, Governor Clark.'* The 

13 I/-L 



ENTERTAINING 



exact words used in introductions are immaterial, so that the 
proper order is preserved. Where sex, age, and position play 
no part, it is sufficient to say "Mrs. Bell, this is Mrs. Adams: 
Mrs. Adams, Mrs. Bell"; or, in the case of two men, "Mr. Grant, 
Mr. Wilson." 

The tactful hostess usually adds to an introduction some remark 
which will enable the guests to converse more readily. She may 
say, for instance, "Mrs. Brown, allow me to present Mrs. Smith; 
Mrs. Smith has just returned from London"; or "Mrs. Smith, 
this is Mrs. Brown; two such ardent club women should know 
each other." There are very few persons who will not be grateful 
for some such hint. 

Seating the Guests 

The servant watches the number of guests, and when all have 
arrived announces dinner; or in case of a belated guest, he waits 
for a signal from the hostess. When dinner is announced the 
host offers his right arm to the lady who is to sit at his right. The 
other couples follow; then, last, the hostess with the gentleman 
who is to sit at her right. 

Guests are enabled to find their places easily by means of 
"place cards," on which the name of each guest is distinctly 
written. Confusion in seating the guests is thus avoided, and 
those who are congenial can be placed near each other. 

The host and hostess may sit at the ends of the table or in the 
middle of each side. The lady who is to be especially honored 
sits on the host's right, she who is to be honored next, on his left. 
Similarly, two gentlemen are honored by seats on the right and 
left of the hostess. 

The hostess should, as far as possible, bring together only guests 
who "mix well," and should select the dinner partners tactfully. 
Two very quiet people should not be seated together, or two who 
have very decided opinions, or two who are known to be uncon- 
genial. The dinner should be a feast of good things other than 
food, and conversation should be as entertaining as possible. 
Upon host and hostess, of course, devolves the duty of keeping 
conversation alive, though the guests are expected to do their 
part. Many a hostess has saved the day by a bon mot or a tactful 
change of subject. Some women are born hostesses, most women 
can be made, or rather can make themselves, successful hostesses. 
The chief essentials are tact, which is the saving grace of women, 
the ability to be interested in many things, and true kindliness. 

14 L-L 



ENTERTAINING 



Courtesy, after all that is, true courtesy is a matter of the 
heart, and is not dependent upon a knowledge of social usages. 
Some women, notably poor conversationalists, are still very 
charming hostesses. In them thoughtfulness and tact make up 
for lack of brilliancy. 

For the sake of her own peace of mind, however, the hostess 
should leave nothing to chance. All should be carefully planned 
beforehand, the servants properly instructed, and everything in 
readiness before the guests arrive, so that the dinner may proceed 
with the smoothness of clockwork, with the hostess as free from 
care as the guests at her own table. 

Menu-Making 

In arranging the menu too much should not be attempted 
and each course should be in pleasing contrast to the last. Except 
for a very elaborate dinner, raw oysters, a clear soup, fish, one 
entree, a roast with potatoes and one other vegetable, salad with 
cheese straws or crackers and cheese, an ice, fruit and black coffee 
should be sufficient. Butter is seldom served except at the 
informal dinner.

ENTERTAINING 



All of these menus are more or less elaborate. They may be 
made much more simple by omitting the appetizers and desserts. 
For a dessert at luncheon, especially where children are served, 
cocoa with whipped cream is a welcome substitute. As people 
are learning to appreciate simplicity of diet more and more, there 
is a tendency to lessen efforts to plan overburdening bills of fare. 

HINTS ON SERVING 

The table should have its centerpiece of growing ferns or flowers, 
and two or four candlesticks with wax candles and pretty shades. 
No edibles, with the exception of bonbons, salted nuts or crystal- 
lized fruits in compotiers, appear upon the table. All the china 
used in the same course should match wherever possible, but a 
different set of plates is permissible for each course. 

A supply of extra silver should be laid out in convenient fashion 
on the sideboard, and finger-bowls, dessert plates, after-dinner 
coffee cups and spoons should be in readiness on the side table. 
Water in the finger-bowls should be warm, with perhaps a dainty 
flower or a leaf of rose geranium floating on the surface. 

1. Food should always be placed before guests from the right. 

2. When a dish is presented from which a guest is to help him- 
self, it should be passed to the left. 

3. When a course is finished, the plate should be removed from 
the left. 

4. Plates should be before the guests when they take seats at 
the table, and when one plate is removed it should be immediately 
replaced by another. 

5. At the right of the plate have oyster fork, soup spoon and 
knives in the order of use, the one first needed farthest from the 
plate. On the left lay the forks in the order of use, the one first 
needed farthest from the plate. Let the bowls of the spoons and 
the tines of the forks be turned upward and the cutting edges of the 
knives toward the plate. The napkin, simply folded, is placed 
at the left of the forks and parallel to them with the open corners 
nearest the guest. A small thick piece of bread or a dinner roll 
may be laid on the napkin or inserted in the fold. The guest 
removes the napkin, leaving the bread at the side of the plate 
until he wishes to eat it. 

6. Set the glass for water above the plate near the end of the 
knife. Each glass should be filled with cracked ice before the 
water is poured. 

7. Before the dessert is served all the plates, small silver, salt 

17 I^L 



ENTERTAINING 



and pepper shakers, and all the glasses that will not be used 
again, should be removed. Then the table should be "crumbed," 
using a silver crumb knife and tray or a napkin and plate. 

8. Spoons or knives and forks for the sweet course are usually 
supplied after the table is cleared. Spoons or knives are laid to 
the right of the plate; forks to the left. If forks only are called 
for, they are placed at the right. 

9. Black coffee in small cups (for which sugar is passed) is the 
last course, and should precede the finger-bowls unless the coffee 
is to be served to the ladies in the drawing-room. In that case 
the finger-bowls should be placed before the ladies leave the table. 

10. If the coffee is to be served in the drawing-room the waitress 
covers a large tray with a white napkin, arranges the filled cups, 
smoking hot, upon it, and carries it into the room where the guests 
are assembled. Many hostesses prefer this way of serving. 

When there is only one pair of hands to do both cooking and 
serving, still less formality should be observed. The service plate 
should be omitted; all the knives and forks to be used should be 
upon the table, with salts and peppers at the corners of the table, 
or one for every two persons. Bread-and-butter plates, containing 
butter-ball, and a small butter knife should be placed at the left 
of the cover before dinner is announced, and a dinner roll folded 
into the napkin. Glasses should be filled with ice water and every- 
thing needed should be on the side table before the guests are 
seated. The plates for each course served on the table should be 
placed in a low pile, not more than three or four at a time, in front 
of the host or hostess. As each is filled the maid will lift it to her 
tray, carry and place it before the guest. 

Where there is no maid, as is the case in seven-eighths of Ameri- 
can homes, the tea- wagon, or " service wagon " may be a most con- 
venient substitute. Upon it, close at the left side of the hostess, 
may be placed all the extra accessories for the various courses, 
and it may be used later for carrying soiled dishes into pantry and 
kitchen. 

THE INFORMAL DINNER 

The informal dinner, to which only a few guests are invited, is 
served almost like the formal dinner; but where there is only one 
waitress it is customary to do much of the serving at the table. 

For this simple dinner, soup, a roast, two vegetables, a salad, 
dessert and coffee amply suffice. 

Soup may be served by the hostess from a tureen. The waitress 

IS i.-i. 



ENTERTAINING 



takes one soup-plate at a time from the sideboard, placing it in 
front of the hostess; when it is filled she passes it to the guest and 
brings another. Fish may be served by the host and passed in 
the same manner as the soup. The roast is carved by the host: 
but entrees, if included in the menu, are served from the side, 
Vegetables and sauces should be placed on the side table and 
passed to each guest when required. The salad may be brought 
in on individual plates or served on the table by either host or 
hostess. The dessert is served by the hostess, and the coffee, 
unless brought in cups from the kitchen, is poured by her. Bon- 
bons and relishes are usually on the table. 

AFTERNOON TEA 

The serving of afternoon tea with its dainty accompaniment of 
sandwiches or cake is coming into ever greater popularity, 
whether at an entertainment to which cards for "Afternoon tea 
at four o'clock" are sent, or during the customary afternoon calls. 
In the former case, naturally, the refreshments are usually more 
elaborate, though in no case should they be heavy, as dinner is so 
close at hand. 

For the small reunion of friends, the tea should be made and 
served by the hostess in the drawing-room or living-room; or in 
summer weather, out-of-doors. Simple sandwiches and cakes are 
served with hot tea, coffee or chocolate; though tea is preferable, 
because less rich and held by most women in high esteem. 

In hot weather, however, iced coffee, tea, or punch is usually 
more acceptable. No service or assistance is necessary except to 
bring in the required articles; the hostess or a friend makes the 
tea and the guests help each other and themselves. 

For the more pretentious afternoon tea, refreshments are served 
in the dining room, from a table made beautiful with flowers, 
lights and tempting viands. At one end of the table is usually a 
tea-service and at the other a service for chocolate; each is pre- 
sided over by a friend of the hostess. The refreshments include 
sandwiches, fancy cakes, olives, bonbons, etc. These are passed 
to the standing guests by waitresses or young girls, also friends of 
the hostess. Napkins are a convenience, but not a necessity; 
sandwiches and cakes are usually placed on the saucer or a plate 
under it. In summer weather, frappe, glace, sherbet, or any 
suitable frozen dessert is sometimes served in addition to the other 
delicacies.

ENTERTAINING 



THE EVENING COLLATION 

Evening refreshments may be of infinite variety from the very 
simple to the most elaborate without regard to appetite or diges- 
tion. The menu may include hot bouillon, hot entrees, sandwiches, 
cold entrees, salads, coffee, salted nuts, ices and cakes. Coffee 
may be served in teacups with the supper or in after-dinner cups 
as a last course. The second way is necessarily customary where 
guests are not seated at tables. 

Only the daintiest of china, glass and silver should appear on 
the table, and all crowding should be avoided; dishes can be 
replenished from the pantry if necessary. The table may be 
simply or elaborately decorated, according to the kind of enter- 
tainment, the season, and inclination of the host. Candle light, 
because of its soft radiance, is preferred to any other; and the 
candlesticks themselves add beauty of the appearance of the table.

APPETIZERS 

A APPETIZERS, which are served at the beginning of a meal, are 
L\- invitations'to the feast, as it were, because their piquant 
flavors or high seasonings stimulate digestion to wait on appetite. 
Native oysters and clams on the half-shell, or imported caviar 
(the salted roe of sturgeon), or anchovies (tiny fish) served as 
canapes, constitute this course at formal dinners; but for other 
meals the fruit cocktail forms a pleasing introduction, especially 
at luncheons. This dainty appetizer, served in its appropriate 
glass, set on a linen or paper doily on a plate, is not only very 
palatable, but may form part of the table decorative scheme.

SOUPS 



Too many cooks spoil the broth because they put no stock in it. 

Fables of a Rolling-Pin.

SOUPS 

THIN clear soups, such as consomme and bouillon, which are 
used as a dinner course, are valuable advance agents of the 
meal, preparing by their warmth and stimulation for the heavier 
courses to follow. Soups containing (bits of meat and vegetables, 
and cream soups, are far more nutritious than clear soups, and may 
be made the basis of a luncheon or supper. The wise housekeeper 
is able to serve soup at a moment's notice by having soup stock 
always on hand. 

MEAT STOCK 

Instruct the butcher to deliver all bones and trimmings removed 
from roasts; and save all meats and gravies left over from previous 
meals. By so doing soup may be at once economical and good. 

To every pound of meat and bone use one quart of cold water. 
Cut the meat into pieces and ask the butcher to crush the large 
bones, so that the gelatine and fat may be fully extracted. Put all 
in a covered kettle on the back of the stove. When the water be- 
comes red bring the kettle forward and let it heat slowly. Keep 
the water below the boiling point for three or four hours. If more 
water is needed, add boiling water. It is not necessary to remove 
the scum that rises. 

Stock should be prepared at least one day before it is to be used, 
so that the fat on the top may harden and be removed. Do not 
remove the fat until it is necessary, however, as it aids in keeping 
the stock sweet. 

VEGETABLE STOCK 

1 carrot 1 tablespoon sugar 

1 onion 4 tablespoons olive oil 

1 Btalk celery 2 quarts cold water 

2 turnips 2 bay leaves 

2 tomatoes Salt and pepper 

Chop the carrot, onion, celery, turnips and tomatoes very fine. 
Put the sugar in a kettle over the fire, and when it is brown add 

29 



Planned for a

the olive oil and the vegetables. Add the water and season to 
taste. Let it simmer for one or two hours; strain and stand aside 
to cool. 

CREAM STOCK 

1 pint milk 1 tablespoon butter 

1 tablespoon flour l / 2 teaspoon salt 

Red or black pepper 

Melt the butter over the fire and add the flour, being careful not 
to let it brown. Add the milk gradually, stirring constantly to 
prevent lumps; then add the seasoning. 

This cream sauce is used instead of stock as the foundation for 
many soups. 

CONSOMME 

2 pounds lean beaf 1 stalk celery 

1 small knuckle veal 1 small carrot 

2 tablespoons butter 1 bay leaf 

1 small onion 2 quarts cold water 

The under part of the round of beef is the best for this soap, 
though any lean portions will do. Cut the beef and veal into 
small pieces and brown them in the butter over a hot fire. Add 
the cold water, onion, celery, carrot and bay leaf; simmer slowlv 
for five or six hours in a covered kettle. Take from the fire; cool; 
remove the fat; strain; reheat and serve. 

BEEF BOUILLON 

6 pounds beef and bone 2 quarts water 

Pepper and salt 

Cut and break the beef and bone, and put it in the water, letting 
it simmer for five or six hours. Then cool and strain through a 
sieve, removing all fatty matter Reheat, seasoning to taste with 
pepper and salt. 

CHICKEN BROTH 

1 chicken l /2 cup rice 

1 quart cold water 1 cup water 

Salt and pepper 

Cut the chicken into small pieces and place it in a deep earthen 
dish; add the quart of water; cover it and set over a kettle of

boiling water, letting it steam until the meat of the chicken has 
become very tender. Strain off the broth and let it stand over 
night. In the morning remove the fat and return the liquid to 
the original earthen dish. Steam the rice in the cup of water until 
it is soft; add it to the broth and steam the whole from one to two 
hours longer, 

CLAM BOUILLON 

1 dozen clams In shells I pint milk 

2 cups water V 2 tablespoon butter 

Salt and red pepper 

Scrub the clams and put them in a covered vessel over the fire

shells open; fill bouillon cups half full of broth; then pour in the 
milk, to which the butter and seasoning have been added. 



OYSTER BOUILLON 

25 oysters 1 pint milk 

1 cup water l /z tablespoon butter 

Salt and red pepper 

Wash the oysters; chop them fine; cover with water or oyster 
juice and cook in a double boiler for one hour, closely covered; 
strain through a sieve; add the milk, separately heated, and the 
butter and seasoning. Serve in bouillon cups, 



OYSTER SOUP No. 1 

25 oysters and juice Salt and pepper 

1 pint milk 1 hard boiled egg 

1 ounce butter 1 soda cracker rolled 

Vi cup chopped celery 

Boil the milk and set it aside. Bring the oyster juice to a boil

FISH 



There be an good fish in the sea as ever yet were caught. 

Proverb.

FISH 

impression that fish, because they are rich in phosphorus, 
*- are particularly good food for brain workers, is not neces- 
sarily true. The fact that they are easily digested, especially 
the white-fleshed kinds, may partially account for this reputation. 
Coming into their prime, as they do, at the end of winter when the 
system is meat-weary, and bringing with them the refreshing 
flavor of the sea, fish afford a pleasant and welcome change of diet. 

Fresh fish have firm flesh, bright eyes and gills, and do not have 
an offensive odor. In stale fish there is danger of ptomaine poison- 
ing. This danger is greatest in fish which have been preserved 
frozen, and have been kept for some time after thawing. 

If fish have not been cleaned when they come from the market, 
clean them immediately. Wash, wipe, and sprinkle with salt. 
If placed in the refrigerator, slip the plate into a paper bag to 
keep the odor from other food; or set the plate on a pan of ice 
and keep it in the cellar. 

Frozen fish should be soaked in cold water until thawed, and 
then removed. Soak salt fish in fresh water, skin side up, to draw 
out the salt. 

White-fleshed fish, such as shad, blue-fish, mackerel, and salmon, 
have fat distributed more or less throughout the body, and are 
seldom fried. They are usually baked, broiled cr planked. 

Of the Great Lakes fish, white-fish are the finest. They are 
cooked in various ways, but are often planked. Of other fresh 
water fish, trout, black bass, and catfish are the best known. 

Codfish, haddock, and halibut may be found in market the year 
around, but are not really good in June, July, August and Septem- 
ber. Flounders are at their best in May. Shad are best in April 
and May, and are in season only in the spring and early summer. 
Blue-fish come in summer and early autumn.

FISH Planned lot a 

JX1 Family of Four 

Of bivalves (shell-fish), oysters and scallops are winter fish; 
clams are year around, being much used in summer when oysters 
are out of season. Of crustaceans (crust-fish), lobsters are to be 
found in market throughout the year, but are best from June to 
September. Crabs also are best in summer. Soft-shell crabs are 
so called because they have shed their hard shells, and have been 
caught before their new shells harden, 

CLEANING FISH 

To remove the scales hold the fish by the tail and scrape firmly 
toward the head with a small sharp knife, held with the blade 
slanting toward the tail. Scrape slowly so that the scales will not 
fly, and rinse the knife frequently in cold water. 

If the fish is to be served whole, leave the head and tail on and 
trim the fins; otherwise remove them. 

To open small fish make an incision under the gills and squeeze 
out the contents by pressing upward from the middle with the 
thumb and finger. To open large fish split them from the gills 
half way down the body toward the tail; remove the entrails 
and scrape and clean, opening far enough to remove all the blood 
from the backbone, and wiping the inside thoroughly with a cloth 
wrung out of cold, salted water. 

To skin a fish remove the fins along the back and cut off a narrow 
strip of the skin the entire length of the back. Then slip the knife 
under the skin that lies over the bony part of the gills and work 
slowly toward the tail. Do the same with the other side. 

To bone a fish clean it first and remove the head. Then, begin- 
ning at the tail, run a sharp knife under the flesh close to the bone, 
scraping the flesh away clean from the bone. Work up one side 
toward the head; then repeat the same process on the other side 
of the bone. Lift the bone carefully and pull out any small bones 
that may be left in the flesh 

BOILED FISH 

Wipe the fish carefully and if fresh, sprinkle thoroughly with 
salt. Wrap it in a piece of cheesecloth to hold the fish together 
and to prevent the scum from clinging to the fish, and place it in 
a kettle of boiling water, adding a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon 
of vinegar to every two quarts of water, also a slice of onion, a bay

table in the front of the book ; lift and drain carefully; open the 
cloth and turn the fish upon the serving platter, garnishing with 
parsley and slices of lemon r The fish is done when the flesh is 
firm and separates easily from the bone* 

As fish used for boiling has Jittle fat and is cooked in none, it 
needs a rich sauce to make it palatable. Drawn butter^ egg, 
Hollandaise and Bechamel sauces are used* 

BAKED USB 

Wash and dry the fish, rubbing inside and out with salt; stuff 
with forcemeat or bread stuffing and sew Cut gashes two inches 
apart on both sides, alternating, and into each slip a narrow strip 
of salt fat pork. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place in a hot 
oven without water. As soon as it begins to brown add hot water 
and butter and baste every ten minutes* Bake until done, allow- 
ing an hour or more for a large fish, twenty or thirty minutes for 
a email one. Remove to a hot platter; draw out the strings; wipe 
off all water or fat and remove pork; garnish with slices of lemon 
well covered with chopped parsley and serve with Hollandaise 
sauce, 

BROILED FISH 

For broiling large fish should be split down the back and head 
and tail removed; salmon and halibut should be cut into one-inch 
slices, and smelts and other small fish left whole. Wipe the fish 
as dry as possible; sprinkle with salt and pepper and if the fish 
is dry and white brush the flesh side well with olive oil or butter. 
Put in a well-greased broiler, placing the thickest parts of the fish 
toward the middle or back of the broiler, Hold over a hot fire 
until the flesh side is nicely browned; then cook the skin side just 
long enough to make the skin crisp. Small fish require from ten 
to fifteen minutes, large fish from fifteen to twenty-five. To remove 
from the broiler loosen one side first, then the other, and lift care- 
fully with a cake turner. Place on a platter; spread with butter 
and stand in the oven for a few minutes. Garnish with lemon and 
serve with Maitre d'Hdtel sauce.

Put only a few pieces of fish in the basket at a time and remove 
them as soon as they are brown. Garnish with parsley and serve 
with Tartare sauce. 

SHAD ROE 

Shad roe may be baked, broiled or fried. To broil, wipe dry; 
sprinkle with pepper and salt and cook five minutes on each side. 
Butter well and stand in the oven for a few minutes; then serve 
garnished with parsley and lemon. To fry, proceed as with fish, 
but cook the roe for ten minutes first in boiling water. 

BAKED SHAD 

Clean and split a three-pound shad, placing it skin side down 
in a baking pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; spread with 
butter and thin slices of bacon and bake twenty-five or thirty 
minutes in a hot oven. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. 

PLANKED SHAD 

Clean and split a three-pound shad. Heat the plank very hot; 
lay the fish upon it, skin side down. Brush the flesh carefully 
over with olive oil or butter; then sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Bake for thirty minutes in a hot oven. It may be cooked in a gas 
range, having the flame over the fish. When cooked pour over the 
fish two tablespoons of melted butter and the juice of one lemon. 
Garnish with parsley, quarters of lemon, and mashed potatoes. 
Shape the potatoes by means of a forcing bag and star tube; 
brush over with beaten yolk of egg; then brown in the oven. Set 
the plank on a serving dish and serve. 

PLANKED HALIBUT 

Trim the ends of a solid piece of halibut, weighing about four 
pounds and cut the entire width of the fish. Peel and slice three 
onions into a baking pan, and on these lay the halibut. Squeeze 
the juice of a small lemon over it; put some pieces of butter on the 
top; pour in a cup of white stock, to which has been added a table- 
spoon of vinegar. Bake for three-quarters of an hour; baste

tered toast. 

FRIED OYSTERS 

Select large oysters; drain them and dry between soft towels, 
Dip each oyster in beaten egg until it is thoroughly coated; then 
roll in cracker dust or fine bread crumbs well seasoned with salt 
and pepper. Lay the oysters in a wire basket, a few at a time, and 
lower them into boiling hot fat. Test the fat by lowering a piece 
of stale bread into it; if it browns in thirty seconds the fat is 
sufficiently hot; if it burns the fat is too hot. Fry the oysters a 
delicate brown; drain them over the fat; then lay on brown paper 
in the oven until serving time. 

Olive oil is best for frying, though suetine, cottolene, crisco, 
or a mixture of suet and lard brings good results. Butter alone or 
lard alone should never be used.

To kill a lobster grasp it by the back and put its head under 
hot water; then its body, and quickly cover the kettle. The 
lobster will die immediately, but should remain in the water about 
twenty minutes, boiling all the time. 

The meat should not be eaten until cold and should never be 
kept more than eighteen hours after cooking. It should not be 
removed from the shell until it is to be used. 

Remove the meat from the shell, discarding the gills, stomach 
and intestines. Garnish with small clams and lettuce leaves. 

PLANKED LOBSTER 

To plank a lobster heat the plank very hot. Kill the lobster 
by splitting it into halves, lay it on the plank shell side down; put 
it under the gas for twenty minutes; baste with butter; dust with 
salt and pepper, and cook ten minutes longer. Garnish with small 
fried French potato balls and grated cucumber in tiny lettuce 
leaves.

MEATS 



Some hue meat and canna eat; 

And some wad eat that want it; 
But we hae meat, and we can eat; 

So let the Lord be thankit. 

ROBERT BURNS: Grace before Meat. 



56 



MEATS 

THE following are the words of a noted dietitian in the employ- 
ment of the United States Government: 

" The custom of serving meat at each meal should be discouraged. 
Deficiency of protein need not be feared when one good meat dish 
a day is served, especially if such food as eggs, milk, cheese, and 
beans are used instead. In localities where fish can be obtained 
fresh and cheap, it should be more frequently substituted for meat 
for the sake of variety as well as economy. Ingenious cooks have 
many ways of * extending the flavor' of meat; that is, of combin- 
ing a small quantity with other material to make a large dish, 
as in meat pies, stews and similar dishes." 

As to Digestibility. Animal protein is more easily digested than 
vegetable protein, such as found in beans and peas, for flesh foods 
are more like the human body, and do not have to undergo the 
same amount of chemical change as do vegetable foods; but the 
drainage of the body is taxed by flesh eating, and certainly too 
much meat is a mistake. When used, meat should form only one- 
fifth, or, at most, one-fourth of a well-balanced meal. This 
subject is further discussed in the chapter on " Balanced Rations, " 
page 417. 

As to Cost. Meat is the most expensive food used in most house- 
holds. There is no need for buying the most expensive cuts. " The 
best is the cheapest," does not apply to foods. The most economi- 
cal food is that which supplies the most nutriment for the least 
money. Prices are not regulated according to their nutritive 
value, but according to attractiveness and scarceness. The nutri- 
ment in an ounce of tenderloin is no more than that of an ounce of 
the round or shoulder. "Much more depends upon the art and 
skill of the cook than upon sums laid out in the market," said 
Count Rumford.

DIAGRAM OF CUTS OF BEEF 
58 



Planned for a 
Family of Four 



The time required for digestion of beet' and mutton is about the 
same. Pork is the most difficult of meats to digest, and is better 
for the use of people who do manual labor than for those who 
exercise little. The flesh of young animals is tender, but is less 
nutritious than that of older ones. Beef and mutton are tfound 
in the markets the year round. Veal and lamb are in season in 
the spring. Pork should not be used in hot weather. 

The methods of cutting meats differ in different localities, but 
the diagrams in this chapter give the housekeeper an idea of the 
general divisions. As a rule, the more tender portions of unused 
muscles lie just below the back of the animal, but the tenderness 
decreases downward, toward the legs, and toward the head. 

Never wash fresh meat. Wipe it with a damp cloth, 

Roasting 

Meats are "roasted" before an open fire, and "baked" in a 
closed oven, although as a matter of convenience the oven method 
is now commonly used. The chief point to remember is that the 
meat should be quickly browned in order that the crust thus formed 
may retain the juices. The oven should therefore be hot when 
the meat is put in and the heat, if possible, gradually reduced. 

Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, but do not wash it. Sprinkle 
with pepper and salt and just a little flour, and put in a pan 
with a small piece of fat or drippings. When the meat is seared, 
add a little water and baste every ten minutes. When one side is 
thoroughly browned, turn over and brown the other side. When 
done, remove the roast; pour off almost all of the fat and make a 
brown sauce according to the directions in the chapter on 
"Sauces." 

If the meat is very lean it is a good plan to lay thin slices of fat 
meat, bacon or pork over the top. 

Broiling 

The object of boiling is to coagulate as quickly as possible all 
the albumen on the surface of the meat, sealing up the pores so 
that none of the juices may escape. It is therefore a good plan to 
warm the gridiron before putting on the meat so that none of the 
heat may be conducted away. The broiling should be done ovet 

59 L-L 



MEATS Planned for 

O.TXJVAJ.O ^ Family of Four 

a clear fire at least two inches away from the gridiron. Meat 
cooked by this method is more wholesome than meat cooked in 
any other way; ^ but if the fire is not hot, most of the juices will be 
lost. Season with salt, pepper and butter when the meat is done; 
do not season before cooking, as salt draws out the juices. 

Pan-broiling is less desirable than broiling over hot coals, 
though when properly done the meat has much the same flavor 
and appearance. Have the pan red hot and if the meat is very 
lean, rub the pan with fat; but do not leave any fat in the pan. 
Sear the meat quickly on one side, then on the other; then cook, 
turning several times. Season and serve. 

Boiling 

Boiling is one of the easiest methods of cooking meat, but it is 
not satisfactory unless the proper method is followed. In making 
soup the meat is put in cold water to draw out the juices; in boiling 
it should be put in hot water, so that the meat and not the water 
may retain the juices and flavoring. Some of them will necessarily 
escape, but the boiling water coagulates the albumen on the sur- 
face of the meat, forming a sort of coat. 

Salt meat should be soaked in cold water before boiling, but 
fresh meat should simply be wiped with a damp cloth. Have the 
kettle scrupulously clean; put in it enough water to cover the 
meat and when boiling drop in the meat. Boil hard for five 
minutes; then draw the kettle aside and let the meat cook slowly 
Cover closely and remove all scum that rises. 

Frying 

Frying is cooking in very hot fat, and the secret of success is 
to have the fat hot enough to harden the outer surface of the meat 
immediately and deep enough to cover the meat. As the fat can 
be saved and used many times, the use of a large quantity is not 
extravagant. 

Have a frying pan with a wire basket and arrange the pieces 
of meat or croquettes so that they will not touch each other. 
Plunge them in the fat, testing it first with a small piece of bread, 
which should brown in thirty seconds. When cooked, drain the 
meat over the hot fat; shake the basket and place the pieces on 
soft paper so that the fat may be absorbed. 

Olive oil is best for frying; but as it is expensive for general use, 

GO L-L ' 



rianned tor a

various compounds such as cottolene, suetine, crisco, etc., may 
be used. These on the whole are better than lard, which is easily 
absorbed and therefore apt to make the food greasy. Suet and 
drippings are cheapest; but suet alone cools quickly and leaves 
a tallowy taste. 

Dry the meat; roll it in fine bread crumbs; then dip it in beaten 
egg diluted with water; roll it in bread crumbs again and fry. 
The white of the egg hardens immediately if the fat is sufficiently 
hot and the fat cannot penetrate to the meat Mix a little salt 
and pepper with the bread crumb? 

Sauteing 

Sauteing is commonly called frying: it consists in cooking with 
a little fat in a shallow pan. This method is apt to make the 
articles greasy and is therefore to be used with caution. Use 
butter, olive oil, or one of the cheaper fats. 

Braising 

Braising is a cross between boiling and baking and is one of 
the best methods of cooking large pieces of tough, lean meat. 
The meat is placed in a closely covered pan partly filled with hot 
stock or water and cooked slowly in the oven. Bay leaf, carrot, 
onion and herbs are added, and the meat is usually seared first 
to prevent escape of the juices in the water c 

Stewing 

Stewing consists in cooking meat in a little water in a closely 
covered vessel. Thickening and vegetables are usually added. 
Cut the meat hi small pieces and brown over the fire; add boiling 
water; cook for a few minutes; then reduce the heat and cook very 
slowly. The long-continued action of the heat softens the fibers 
and renders the coarsest and cheapest kinds of meat tender and 
palatable 

Fricasseeing

until tender and serve with white or brown sauce made from thr

placing in a hot frying pan and turning until the entire surface is 
browned, then put in a kettle with not more than a cup of hot 
water; cover tightly and keep just below the boiling point. Do 
not let the meat boil dry, but add only enough water to keep it 
from burning. Cook until tender and add pared potatoes one half 
hour before it is done. Serve with brown sauce made from the 
fat in the pot.

remove and cool it, saving the broth for soup. Cut the cold meat 
into half-inch dice; add seasoning and butter and the flour well 
mixed with the cream. Bring to a boil, stir in the jelly and serve. 



PLANKED STEAK 

Nearly all planking boards are now fitted out with steel rods 
or bars to hold the steak in place and grooves for the conservation 
of the gravy. Before using, heat the board very hot before the 
fire or in the oven, lay the steak on and fasten into place. Brush 
over with olive oil or melted butter; dust with salt and pepper 
and lay the plank in the broiler chamber of a gas range for at least 
fifteen minutes. Baste frequently and reverse the plank from time 
to time. 

While the steak is cooking press fresh-boiled potatoes through a 
ricer; season with salt and pepper; add a little butter and cream; 
and beat with a fork until very light. When the steak is nearly 
done take the board from the oven; put the beaten potato into a 
pastry bag and force through the tube, rose fashion, at regular 
intervals along the edge of the steak on the board. 

Between the potato roses make little mounds of cauliflower, 
mushrooms, spinach or onions. Return to the oven and allow 
them to brown delicately. Garnish with cress and send the steak 
to the table on the plank, setting it on a large platter or tray

EGGS 

EGGS are a highly concentrated food, a pound (about nine) being 
nearly equal in nutritive value to a pound of beef. They 
make an excellent meat substitute, but when so used should be 
served with starchy foods, since they lack in fuel value. 

Eggs should not be cooked at a higlTtemperature, intense heat 
causing albumen to harden and become difficult of digestion, 

BOILED EGGS 

Soft-boiled eggs may be prepared in two ways. The eggs may 
be dropped carefully into boiling water and boiled three minutes, 
or they may be placed in a covered vessel of boiling water and 
allowed to stand in a warm place (but not on the stove) for ten 
minutes. Eggs prepared in this way are sometimes called "Cod- 
dled Eggs." They are much more delicate and digestible than 
the usual "Boiled Eggs." 

"Hard-boiled" eggs should be put into cold water and brought 
to the boiling point. Let them cook just below the simmering 
point for twenty or thirty minutes, and then drop them into cold 
water to prevent the yolk from turning dark. 

POACHED EGGS 

Bring salted water to a boil in a shallow vessel; remove from the 
fire and slip the eggs carefully into it, breaking each into a small 
saucer first. Place the pan over a moderate fire and let the water 
come slowly to a boil. By this time the whites of the eggs should 
be delicately set. Lift the eggs carefully; trim off the ragged 
edges and serve on slices of buttered toast. 

FRIED EGGS 

Melt in a frying-pan a large piece of butter; or use the fat 
of ham or bacon. When hot, drop in the eggs, one at a time, 
being careful not to break the yolk. When the white of the egg

is set they are done, though some persons like them turned over 
and cooked on the other side. Remove from the pan with a cake- 
turner and serve at once. 

SHIRRED EGGS 

Eggs may be shirred in one large baking dish or pan, but are 
better and look more tempting in individual ramekins or custard 
cups. Place a small piece of butter in the bottom of each; break 
the egg; drop it in without breaking the yolk; season with pepper 
and salt and put another small piece of butter on the top. Bake 
in a hot oven until the white is set, and serve immediately. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

4 eggs 1/2 tablespoon butter 

4 tablespoons milk or water Salt and pepper 

Break the eggs In a bowl and beat them thoroughly; add the 
milk and seasoning and beat again. Melt the butter in a frying- 
pan over the fire; pour in the eggs; stir occasionally but not con- 
stantly until they thicken; then serve at once. 

GRIDDLED EGGS 

Heat a griddle as if for baking cakes; butter it lightly and ar- 
range small muffin rings on it. Drop an egg in each and turn as 
soon as lightly browned. Griddled eggs resemble fried eggs but 
are far more delicate. 

CURRIED EGGS 

6 hard-boiled eggs l /2 teaspoon salt

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

FIAT meat in the diet is not essential for efficiency for many 
people at least is shown by the fact that a Chinese coolie, 
for a day's work, carried a pack of tea weighing a hundred and 
fifty pounds over forty miles of road on a diet almost exclusively 
of rice; that the almost indefatigable Japanese soldiers are rice- 
fed; that a vegetarian won the recent walking race of the British 
Isles from Land's End to John o' Groats, doing the nine hundred 
and eight miles in less than seventeen days. 

Whether or not the use of meat is best for health and efficiency 
has never been fully agreed upon. It is more or less a personal 
question, depending to a great extent upon the dietary habits 
formed in childhood, and upon one's occupation; but doubtless 
we, as a nation, eat too much meat. In many American homes, 
meat is eaten three times a day. This mistaken idea of being 
well-fed may have come about because of lack of knowledge of 
the amount of protein contained in some other foods. 

A quart of milk, three-quarters of a pound of moderately fat 
beef, and five ounces of bread, all contain about the same amount 
of nutritive material. The milk comes the nearest of being a 
perfect food. Cheese, made of the curd of milk, stands almost at 
the head of the list of foods as far as nutritive value is concerned; 
but in large amounts, or when cooked at high temperature, it is 
not readily digested by some people. In cooking, it should be 
diluted with milk or used with other food, because it is so highly 
concentrated; and it should be well masticated. The question 
of digestion is again a personal one, about which no wholesale 
statement can be made. It is well to serve such green vegetables 
as lettuce, watercress, celery, with this concentrated food. 

In looking for ideal meat substitutes, eggs immediately suggest

themselves, not only because of their high nutritive value, but 
because of their pleasing appearance when cooked, and because of 
the great variety of dishes which can be made from their use. 

Among vegetables rich in protein and in fuel value, dried beans, 
peas, and lentils are excellent substitutes for meat. They contain 
as much protein as meat, and their fuel value is almost equal to 
that of cheese, and they are used extensively by people who, cither 
from choice or necessity, eat little or no meat. Care must be 
taken, however, to have them very thoroughly cooked. The impov- 
erished Mexican uses at almost every meal the native bean or 
frijole, made palatable with green vegetables and chile or red 
pepper. There is a Hindoo proverb, "Rice is good, but lentils 
are my life," showing in what esteem the protein of the lentil 
was held even among ancient peoples. 

Nuts also are used as substitutes for meat; for they are very 
rich in oil, with only a small percentage of starch and sugar, and 
are also rich in nitrogen (protein) . Though frequently indigestible 
when used by themselves, if properly combined with other foods, 
they should be quite easy of digestion by any normal person.

The dried legumes are excellent if properly cooked, and form a 
palatable dish if simply boiled until tender and seasoned with but- 
ter, pepper and salt. 

The first important step is the swelling and softening of the 
legume by soaking in water a number of hours, usually not less 
than eight, and the removal of such parts as will not soften by 
cooking. The skin of the ripened pea and lentil is easily removed, 
and both peas and lentils are therefore more easily prepared than 
beans. Many kinds of beans, however, after proper soaking may 
be freed from their skins by stirring in water. The skins rise to 
the top and can be skimmed off. The large lima beans after 
soaking may easily be slipped out of the skins by pressing them 
between the fingers. 

Soft water should be used for both soaking and boiling the 
legumes; but if neither is available, simply boil the water before 
using and pour it from the sediment. In soaking beans baking 
soda may be used to soften the water (using a quarter teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in one quart of water to every pound of beans),

as it increases the digestibility of the beans and does not destroy 
the flavor. . . . . 

Dried peas, beans and lentils are better if cooked slowly all day, 
If desired, the flavor may be improved by the addition of onion, 
flavoring herbs or meat stock. The legumes may be left whole or 
mashed through a sieve. In either case they will be greatly im- 
proved by the addition of butter and abundant seasoning; the 
salt should be cooked with them, allowing one half tablespoon tor 
one pint of beans, and the pepper added with the butter. 

LENTILS A LA CREOLE 

1/2 cup lentils 1 sma11 onion 

1 tablespoon butter 1 cup tomatoes 

1 green pepper Salt and pepper

Let the lentils soak over night in water, adding a pinch of bak- 
ing soda if the water is hard. In the morning, drain; cover with 
fresh water and let simmer for one half hour; drain again; cover 
with hot water and let simmer slowly until the lentils are tender. 
Put the butter in a saucepan and melt; add the pepper and onion, 
both finely chopped; stir and cook until the butter is browned. 
Add the tomatoes, canned or raw; season to taste; and into tJ 
empty the lentils after they have been drained and mashed through 
a colander. Cook slowly for about thirty minutes; pour into a 
deep platter and surround with a border of rice.

with about a quart of water. As soon as the water begins to boil 
the lentils will rise to the top. Remove them with a> skimmer; 
put them in a deep baking dish with the pork and onion in t 
center and pour over them the pint of boiling water, in which th 
salt and pepper have been mixed. Bake in a moderate oven four

fold in the beaten whites; pour into a buttered baking dish and 
cook about twenty minutes in a slow oven. Serve at once or the 
souffle will not be light. 

CHEESE ROLLS 

A large variety of rolls may be made by combining cooked 
beans, lentils or peas with cheese and adding bread crumbs to make 
the mixture thick enough to form into a roll. Beans are usually 
mashed, but peas or lima beans may be combined whole with 
bread crumbs and grated cheese and enough of the water in which 
the vegetables have been cooked to insure the right consistency. 

Chopped spinach, beet greens or lettuce may be used instead of 
the legumes if desired. 

Cottage cheese, cream cheese, American or English dairy cheese 
may be used. 

BAKED RICE 

2 cups boiled rice l /z cup milk 

1 cup grated cheese Salt and red pepper 

1 tablespoon butter Bread crumbs 

Arrange the rice in a baking dish in layers, covering each with 
cheese, a little milk, butter, salt and red pepper. Spread bread 
crumbs over all and bake in a moderate oven until the crumbs are 
browned. 

English dairy cheese is preferred for this, although American 
cheese will do. 

ENGLISH RICE

dish, then a layer of nuts, then rice, then nuts again until the entire 
quantity is used, making the last layer of rice. Pour the tomatoes 
over this and bake in a moderate oven thirty minutes. 

PEANUT BUTTER 

Nuts are found indigestible chiefly because of the impossibility 
of grinding them fine enough with the teeth. The value of nut 
butters is therefore obvious. 

Almost any kind of nut will make good butter, but peanuts are 
perhaps the best and the most generally available. Pound freshly 
roasted nuts in a mortar or put them through a chopper, using the 
knife designed especially for the making of nut butters. Season 
with salt and add a little olive oil if desired. In most cases the oil 
from the nuts is sufficient to moisten the butter. 



NUT AND FRUIT CHEESE 

14 pound figs 2 ounces almonds 

1 A pound seeded raisins 2 ounces pine nuts 

14 pound dates 2 ounces Brazil nuts 

1 A pound pecans 



Wash the fruit and stone the dates. Mix thoroughly with the 
nuts and put through a meat chopper. Press the mixture into 
baking powder tins and stand in a cool place. When wanted for 
use loosen the sides with a thin knife-blade and turn out on a 
board. Cut into thin slices and serve in the place of meat or put 
between thin slices of buttered bread.

and press the lentils through a colander. To them add the nuts, 
either ground or chopped, the bread crumbs and seasoning and 
milk sufficient to make the mixture the consistency of mush. Put 
into a greased baking dish; bake in a moderate oven for an hour; 
turn out on a heated platter; garnish with parsley or watercress 
and serve.

LEFT-OVERS 



I found a little crust of bread that must not go to waste, 

80, by a famous recipe, I seasoned it to taste. 

I used six eggs, a pint of cream, some citron and some spice, 

Two lemons, dates and raisins, and a brimming cup of rice. 

It took a lot of things,, I know 

(That's Iww the cook-book read); 

And no one cared for it but oh! 

I saved that crust of bread.

LEFT-OVERS 

EFT-OVERS afford the cook an opportunity for the display 
of her ingenuity that is not to be slighted. To concoct a 
pleasing dish out of an unpromising left-over is a small triumph 
that is in itself its own reward. Almost any one can succeed 
with new and fresh material, but to take old materials that are 
too good to be wasted, and make them appear new and tempting, 
is a branch of the art of cooking that will repay the extra time and 
study that it takes. Made-over dishes are especially useful for 
luncheons or suppers, when only a light meal is needed. What 
otherwise might be a loss of good food can often be made to 
appear on the table as a most desirable addition to the menu. 

There are throughout this book many recipes that call for 
cold meats and vegetables, so that this chapter is not the only 
one to be studied by the economical cook. See especially the 
chapter on "Entrees."

VEGETABLES 

A,L the elements needed for nutrition are found in vegetables. 
In beans, peas, lentils, and other legumes, much protein is 
furnished, and for this reason they can often be used in place of 
meat. (See chapter on "Meat Substitutes.") In such vegetables 
as potatoes and squash there is an abundance of starchy or fuel- 
and-energy food. From olives, nuts, and corn come oils which 
are also fuel-and-energy foods. Lettuce, spinach, cabbage, turnips, 
carrots, tomatoes, and other succulent (juicy) vegetables contain 
the valuable mineral matter and vitamins which no chemist save 
Nature can wisely furnish. 

Perhaps one reason why vegetables are not used in greater 
variety is that they are not always properly cooked. Over-cooking 
lessens the food value of many vegetables, destroys their color, 
and tends to make them tasteless and tough. Green vegetables 
should not be permitted to boil one minute after they begin to 
lose their green color. As a rule, root vegetables, such as turnips, 
carrots, and salsify are best cooked in unsalted water, gently boiling. 
This applies emphatically to turnips. Never soak wilted vege- 
tables in salted water, for salt hardens the fiber. This is particu- 
larly true of cucumbers. Use fresh cold water. 

Potatoes should be thinly pared, not so much for economy, as 
to save the mineral matters which are stored close to the skin. 
Jacket-boiled potatoes retain most, and baked potatoes retain 
practically all of these valuable food adjuncts. 

Canned goods are improved if the contents are removed from 
the container upon opening, and exposed to the air for an hour or 
more to re-oxygenate. 

Delicate vegetables containing sugar, such as green peas and 
sweet corn, lose flavor and sweetness every minute after leaving

VEGETABLES 



the mother-stalk. Leave them in pod or husk until ready to cook, 
and then serve as nearly immediately as possible. 

Start vegetables with boiling water. With very few exceptions, 
they should be left uncovered, or only partially covered, to permit 
exposure to the air. Of course this does not apply when a steamer 
is used in cooking, 

CABBAGE 

Divide a small head of cabbage into four parts, cutting down 
through the stock; soak for one-half hour in a pan of cold water to 
which has been added a tablespoon of vinegar; then remove from 
the water and cut in slices. Have a large saucepan full of boiling 
water; put in the cabbage, pushing the slices under the water with 
a spoon; add a tablespoon of salt and cook from twenty-five to 
sixty minutes, according to the age of the cabbage. Drain through 
a colander; then put in a chopping bowl and mince. Season 
with butter, pepper and more salt if needed, and stand over the 
fire for a few minutes to reheat. Allow a tablespoon of butter to 
a pint of cooked cabbage. 

The addition of a quarter teaspoon of bi-carbonate of sod;i 
reduces the time of cooking, helps retain color and lessens the odor. 



CABBAGE WITH PORK 

For a small head of cabbage use half a pound of minced salt 
pork. Boil the pork gently for three or four hours. Prepare the 
cabbage as for plain boiled cabbage; drain well and put on to boil 
with the pork. Boil and serve the pork with the cabbage. A 
little additional salt may be needed. 

Smoked bacon or ham or corned beef may be substituted for the 
pork; but these are usually better if cooked separately from the 
cabbage. 



LADY CABBAGE 

Prepare and cook the cabbage in the usual way. Chop very 
fine; return to the fire; cover with milk; season; bring to a boil 
and serve.

CREAMED CABBAGE 

Make a cream sauce; add the boiled cabbage, chopped; bring 
to a boil and serve, sprinkling a little chopped parsley over the top 
of the dish. 

CAULIFLOWER 

Remove all the large green leaves and the greater part of the 
stalk, and soak, head down, in a pan of cold water which contains 
to each quart of water a tablespoon of vinegar. Put in a large 
saucepan, stem end down; cover with boiling water; add a table- 
spoon of salt and cook from twenty to thirty minutes, according 
to the size of the head and its compactness. Remove as soon as 
done, for overcooking darkens it. 

CREAMED CAULIFLOWER 

Make a cream sauce; add the boiled cauliflower, broken into 
pieces, and serve. 

CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN 

Break boiled cauliflower into small flowerets; place in layers in 
a buttered pudding dish, covering each with cream sauce and 
grated cheese. Spread buttered bread crumbs over the top of the 
dish and bake until brown. 

CAULIFLOWER POLONAISE 

1 head cauliflower Yolks of 3 eggs 

iy 2 teaspoons mustard 1 A cup olive oil 

1V 4 teaspoons salt J /2 cup vinegar 

1 teaspoon powdered sugar 2 tablespoons melted butter 

y 2 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon chopped parsley 

Cook the cauliflower as usual; when done break into flowerets 
and cover with a sauce made from the other ingredients. Mix 
the dry ingredients; add the beaten eggs, then the oil and 
vinegar. Cook over hot water until the mixture thickens; re- 
move from fire and add the butter and parsley. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS

or more. Drain well and empty them into boiling salted water, 
allowing one teaspoon of salt to two quarts of water. Boil rapidly 
for fifteen or twenty minutes, according to the size of the heads; 
when done, turn into a colander and pour cold water over the 
heads. Reheat in butter and seasoning or in cream sauce. 

KALE 

Remove all the old or tough leaves; wash the kale thoroughly 
and drain. Put it into boiling water to which has been added salt 
in the proportion of one half tablespoon to two quarts of water. 
Boil rapidly, uncovered, until the vegetable is tender; pour off the 
water; chop the kale very fine; return it to the kettle with one 
tablespoon of butter and two of meat stock or water to every pint 
of the minced vegetable. Add more salt if necessary; cook for ten 
minutes and serve at once. The entire time for cooking varies 
from thirty to fifty minutes. 

BOILED LETTUCE 

Lettuce that has grown too old for salad may still be cooked, 
forming a very palatable dish. Wash four or five heads of lettuce, 
removing the thick bitter stalks and retaining only the sound 
leaves. Cook in boiling, salted water for ten or fifteen minutes; 
drain in a colander, pouring cold water over them. Chop and re- 
heat with butter and seasoning or with cream sauce. 

BEET GREENS 

Beets are usually thickly sowed, and as the young plants begin 
to grow they must be thinned out. These plants make delicious 
greens, and even the tops of the ordinary market beets are good if 
properly prepared. Examine the leaves carefully to be sure that 
there are no insects on them; wash thoroughly in several waters, 
and put over the fire in a large kettle of boiling water. Add a 
teaspoon of salt for every two quarts of greens; boil rapidly about 
thirty minutes or until tender; drain off the water; chop well and 
season with butter and salt. 

SPINACH 

Perhaps no other vegetable requires such care in the preparation 
as spinach. In the first place it takes a great deal of time, water 
and patience to wash it clean. Cut off the roots; break the leave?

apart; drop them in a large pan of water; rinse well; lift them out 
separately and drop back into a second pan of water. Continue 
washing in fresh waters until there is not a grain of sand to be 
found in the bottom of the pan. Drain the spinach and drop it 
into boiling water, allowing one pint of water and one tablespoon 
of salt to a half peck of spinach. Let it simmer for twenty 
minutes or more, counting from the time it begins to boil, and 
drawing the cover of the saucepan to one side to allow the steam 
to escape. Empty into a colander; pour cold water over the 
spinach; drain and mince fine. Return to the fire with seasoning 
and butter, or drippings from roast beef or chicken if preferred. 
Garnish with hard-boiled egg or serve with cream sauce. 

DANDELIONS 

Gather young dandelion plants before they have flowered; cut 
off the roots; wash thoroughly; boil in salted water about one hour, 
leaving the lid partly off. Drain and chop fine; season with salt, 
pepper or vinegar, and a liberal measure of butter. 

If cooked with half spinach or beet greens it is less bitter and 
more palatable to some people. In this case the dandelion should 
be partly cooked before the other vegetable is added. 

LEEKS 

Wash and trim the leeks and cook them in boiling salted water 
until soft. Drain thoroughly; season with butter, salt and pepper, 
and serve. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

1 quart peeled and cut artichokes 1 tablespoon butter 
1 pint milk 1 tablespoon flour 

1 small onion 1 teaspoon salt 

l /4 teaspoon pepper 

Wash and peel the artichokes and cut them into small cubes; 
put in a double boiler; cover with milk; add the onion and cook 
twenty minutes. Beat the butter and flour together and stir them 
into the milk; add the seasoning and cook for a half hour longer-

water and cook until tender, from thirty to fifty minutes; take up 
and remove the choke. Serve hot with melted butter or cold with 
French salad dressing. 

GREEN PEAS 

Shell the peas and cover them sparingly with water; bring to a 
boil; then push aside until the water will just bubble gently. When 
the peas are tender add salt and butter; cook ten minutes longer 
and serve. If the peas are not the sweet variety, add a teaspoon 
of sugar. 

SUGAR PEAS 

Sugar peas may be cooked in the pods like string beans. Gather 
the pods while the seeds are still very small; string like beans and 
cut into pieces. Cover with boiling water and boil gently for 
twenty-five or thirty minutes or until tender. Pour off most of the 
water, saving it for soup; season the rest with salt and butter and 
serve. 

STRING BEANS 

Remove the strings carefully; break the pods into one-inch 
pieces; wash thoroughly; add just enough boiling water to prevent 
burning, salt at the end of ten minutes, and let simmer until tender. 
Season with butter. 

Pork may be boiled with the beans if desired. Boil a quarter 
of a pound for five hours; then add the beans. 

GREEN LIMA BEANS 

Cover the shelled beans with boiling water; bring to a boil 
quickly ; then let them simmer slowly until tender. Drain and 
add salt, pepper and butter or hot cream or cream sauce. 

DRIED BEANS AND PEAS 

Recipes for cooking dried beans and peas will be found in the 
chapter on "Meat Substitutes." 

BOILED TURNIPS 

Have the turnips peeled and sliced and drop them into boiling 
water sufficient to cover. Cook until tender; drain well; chop 
them or mash with a wooden potato masher. Season with salt, 
butter and pepper and serve at once.

drop them into a small quantity of boiling water; salt at the end 
of ten minutes. Boil until tender; drain and serve with butter 
and pepper or with cream sauce. 

CARROTS AND PEAS 

Cook the carrots; add an equal quantity of cooked peas; sea- 
son with butter, pepper and sa)t, or beat both together in a cream 
sauce. 

PARSNIPS 

Wash the parsnips clean; boil them until tender; scrape off the 
skin and slice them into a vegetable dish, seasoning with salt, 
pepper and butter or pouring drawn butter over them. 

If preferred, the cooked parsnips may be chopped rather coarse, 
seasoned and returned to the fire with milk sufficient to cover them. 
Thicken with a teaspoon of flour rubbed in a tablespoon of butter; 
simmer for ten minutes and serve. 

Still another method of serving the parsnips is to fry the slices 
in butter after they have been boiled. 

KOHL-RABI 

Kohl-rabi or kale turnip is a cultivated variety of kale or cab- 
bage, distinguished by the swelling of the stem in turnip form. 
This swollen portion is used for food, cooked like turnips or un- 
cooked in slices like radishes. 

SALSIFY 

6 large roots 1 teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon vinegar 3 pints water 

2 tablespoons flour 1 cup cream sauce 

To prevent the roots from turning dark they must be dropped 
as soon as they are pared and cut into the mixture of flour, salt, 
water and vinegar. Wash and scrape the roots; cut them into 
slices about three inches long and drop them into the prepared 
water. Place the saucepan on the fire and cook for thirty minutes 
after it begins to boil. Drain and serve with white or cream sauce.

BEETS 

Wash the beets, being careful not to break the skin ; cover them 
with boiling water and boil until tender. Remove from the fire; 
drop into cold water and rub off the skins. Cut the beets into 
thin slices or chop them if not young; season with salt, butter and 
pepper and serve at once. 



PICKLED BEETS 

If beets are very old they will be better pickled in vinegar. Boil 
and slice them; cover with vinegar and let stand until cold. 

CREAMED CELERY 

Remove the leaves from the stalks of celery; scrape off all 
rusted or dark spots; cut into small pieces and drop in cold water. 
Have boiling water ready; put the celery into it, and salt at the 
end of ten minutes. ^ Boil until tender, leaving the cover partly 
off; drain and rinse in cold water. Make a cream sauce; drop 
the celery into it; heat thoroughly and serve. 

BOILED ONIONS 

Peel the onions and cut off the roots; drop each into cold water 
as soon as it is peeled. When all are ready, drain and put in a 
saucepan well covered with boiling water, adding a teaspoon of 
salt for every quart of water. Boil rapidly for ten minutes with 
the cover off; drain and return to the fire with fresh water. 
Simmer until tender; add pepper and butter and serve, or omit 
the butter and pepper and pour a cream sauce over the onions.

of pepper. Then dip the slices in dried bread crumbs; spread on 
a dish for twenty minutes or more and fry until brown in deep fat. 



BAKED EGGPLANT 

Make a dressing as for stuffed peppers, using, however, a little 
more salt, pepper and butter. Cut the eggplant in two lengthwise; 
scrape out the inside; mash it fine; mix with the dressing and re- 
turn to the shells. Place on a pan in the oven and bake forty-five 
minutes. Serve in the shells, placing a doily under each half.

BROILED EGGPLANT 

Slice the eggplant and drain it as for frying; spread the slices on 
a dish; season with salt and pepper; baste with olive oil; sprinkle 
with dried bread crumbs and broil. 

SQUASH 

Summer and winter squash are prepared and boiled in the same 
way. Wash and pare the squash; cut it into small pieces; cook 
in boiling water for half an hour; mash fine and season with salt, 
pepper and plenty of butter. 

BAKED SQUASH 

Wash a Hubbard squash and cut it into large pieces, removing 
the pulp. Place these, outer side down, in a shallow baking dish 
and bake until brown. Baked squash is eaten like baked sweet 
potatoes with butter and salt. 

STEAMED SQUASH 

Remove the top of a Hubbard squash and steam the rest until 
tender. Discard the pulp; scoop out the remainder of the soft 
portion; mash it, seasoning well with salt, pepper and butter; re- 
heat; return to the shell and score the dome-shaped surface with a 
knife. Place the squash on a plate with a doily beneath it and 
serve. 

CORN ON THE COB 

Free the corn from husks and silk; have a kettle of water boiling 
hard; drop the corn into it and cook ten minutes (or longer if the 
corn is not young). If a very large number of ears are put into 
the water they will so reduce the temperature that a longer time 
will be needed. In no case, however, should the corn be left too 
long in the water, as overcooking spoils the delicate flavor. 

CORN OFF THE COB 

Corn is frequently cut from the cob after it is cooked and served 
in milk or butter; but by this method much of the flavor and juice 
of the corn itself is wasted. It is better to cut the corn from the 
cob before cooking. With a sharp knife cut off the grains, not 
cutting closely enough to remove any of the woody portion or the

skins. Then with a knife press out all the pulp and milk remaining 
in the cob; add this to the corn; season well with salt, pepper and 
butter; add a little more milk if the corn is dry; cook, preferably 
in the oven, for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally. If the 
oven is not hot, cook over the fire. 



SUCCOTASH 

To a pint of corn cooked off the cob add a pint of cooked and 
creamed Lima beans. 

CORN PUDDING 

6 ears corn y 2 teaspoon sugar 

1 cup hot milk 1 tablespoon butter 

l / 4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon flour 
1 egg 

Prepare the corn as for cooking off the cob. Melt the butter; 
mix well with the flour; add the milk gradually, then the season- 
ing and corn, and last of all the beaten egg. Pour into a buttered 
baking dish and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. 



STEWED MUSHROOMS 

1 pint mushrooms Salt and pepper 

1 tablespoon butter Flour 

Wash the mushrooms; peel them and cut off the bottom of the 
stalks. Melt the butter; add the mushrooms, sprinkling them 
with salt, pepper and flour. Let them cook slowly in the butter 
and their own liquor for about fifteen minutes. 

If desired, a few tablespoons of cream and a little grated nutmeg 
may be added to the butter, and the mushrooms served on small 
pieces of buttered toast. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS 

Wash the mushrooms; remove the stems and peel the caps. 
Place them in a broiler and broil for five minutes, with the cap side 
down during the first half of broiling. Serve on circular pieces of 
buttered toast, sprinkling with salt and pepper and putting a small 
piece of butter on each cap.

melted butter. 

MUSHROOMS A LA POULETTE 

Stew the mushrooms in cream; remove from the fire and stir in 
the beaten yolks of two eggs. Return to the fire to let the eggs 
thicken; then serve at once. 



BOILED CHESTNUTS 

Boil the chestnuts a few minutes; drain and remove the shells 
and skins. Boil again until tender, adding sufficient salt to make 
them palatable. Drain again; shake over the fire until dry; cover 
with cream sauce and serve at once. If allowed to stand the chest- 
nuts become heavy and unappetizing. 



ROASTED CHESTNUTS 

With a sharp knife cut across on the flat side of each chestnut; 
put them in a wire pan and shake constantly over a hot fire until 
the shells split. Serve at once. 

BOILED POTATOES 

If the potatoes are to be boiled in their skins, cut a narrow band 
of skin from the center of the potato and small pieces from the 
ends. If the potatoes are to be peeled, use a very sharp knife and 
remove as thin a layer as possible. If the potatoes are very young, 
the skins may be scraped off. Let the potatoes boil fifteen minutes ; 
then add a tablespoon of salt for every dozen- potatoes; boil until 
tender and remove immediately from the water so that they will 
not become soggy. They will be improved by being kept hot for 
an hour or more provided that they are so ventilated that they dry 
rather than retain moisture. 

Boiled potatoes may be served dry or covered with cream sauce.

Wash the potatoes perfectly clean and let them drain; put them 
in an old baking pan in a hot oven and bake until soft. Potatoes 
of medium size will take about forty minutes. Baked potatoes 
should be served as soon as they are done, but if they must stand 
for any time the skins should be broken so that the moisture may 
escape. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES 

Pare the potatoes and throw them into cold water until needed. 
Dry them with a towel; cut into small pieces lengthwise of the 
potato; drop them into hot fat and remove when lightly browned. 
It is better to fry only a few at a time, letting those done stand in 
a colander in the oven to keep hot. When all are done, sprinkle 
with salt and serve at once. 

For variety, and for use in garnishing, cut the potatoes into 
balls, using the vegetable cutter which comes for this purpose.

VEGETABLE HASH 

Hash may be made with one or many vegetables and with or 
without the addition of meat and fish. Potato is the most useful 
vegetable for hash, because it combines well with meat or other 
vegetables. The vegetables must be chopped fine, well seasoned 
with salt and pepper, and parsley, onion, chives or green pepper 
if desired, and moistened with stock, milk or water, using a quar- 
ter of a cup to a pint of hash. Melt a half tablespoon of butter or 
savory drippings in a pan; put in the hash, spreading it evenly and 
dropping small pieces of butter or drippings over the top." Cover

REHEATING VEGETABLES 

Left-over potatoes, turnips, parsnips, carrots, and similar 
vegetables may be cut into cubes and reheated in cream sauce. 
It is essential to have the sauce freshly made and very hot when 
the vegetables are entered. They may be served in this style, or 
the dish may be sprinkled with buttered bread-crumbs, and 
browned in the oven. Or, using a thick cream sauce as a "binder," 
the vegetables may be made into croquettes. Of course, if so 
used, they must be mashed first. 

Left-over stewed tomatoes may be strained and used as stock 
for tomato sauce, which is an excellent foundation for reheating 
cold meats,

PATTY SHELLS 

Follow the directions for making puff-paste. One half pound 
of flour will make about six patty shells. 

Roll the paste to a thickness of one fourth inch; stamp out 
with a large round cutter and cut the centers from half of the 
rounds. Lay the rings thus made on the whole rounds, pressing 
them down so that they will stick together. In cold weather 
it may be necessary to wet the top of the large rounds near the 
edge to make sure that the rings will not slip. If deeper patty 
shells are wished two or three rings may be placed on top of the 
rounds instead of one. 

Have the oven as hot as for baking white bread. The shells 
should rise in ten minutes and then take twenty minutes longer 
to bake through and brown. There will usually be a little soft 
dough left in the center. This should be carefully removed 
with a fork. 

VOL-AU-VENT 

Roll puff-paste one half inch thick and from it cut out two large 
ovals, using a sharp knife first dipped in flour. Place it on a shal- 
low baking tin; cut a smaller oval from the second piece and lay 
the ring on the first, moistening slightly so that the two will stick 
together when baked. Roll out the piece cut from the second 
oval until it is the size of the others and bake in a separate pan as 
a cover for the vol-au-vent, Bake in a hot oven, covering with 
paper after the first fifteen minutes. It will require three quarters 
of an hour or longer; and unless baked thoroughly the crust will 
fall in cooling. When ready to use, reheat and fill with creamed 
oysters or game; or for dessert fill with sugared fruit and serve 
with whipped cream.

MEAT CROQUETTES 

Veal, mutton, lamb, beef and turkey croquettes may be prepared 
in the same way as chicken croquettes. The secrets of success

mixture of any of these with drippings will serve the purpose; 
but olive oil is best.

SALADS 



To make a really good salad the poem-in-a-picture kind takes 
the eye of an artist in selection, the niggardliness of a miser with 
vinegar, the wisdom of a counselor with salt, and the extravagance 
of a spendthrift with oil. 

Old Recipe. 



166 



SALADS 

NO one knows how many centuries salads have been a favorite 
form of food; probably ever since the ancients discovered 
that olives would yield their rich, nutritious oil. And rightly so, 
for the green, uncooked vegetable furnishes the mineral salts, the 
valuable vitamins, and the bulk so much needed; the oil supplies 
fuel-and-energy food; and the acid of the vinegar, or of the deli- 
cately perfumed lemon, aids digestion. More and more the Ameri- 
can people are learning that salads should appear on the table 
every day in the year. Perhaps the reason that they are not as 
generally served as they deserve to be is due to the too common 
use of inferior oils. While there is much nutriment in peanut oil 
and in cotton-seed oil, neither can be compared with pure olive 
oil in flavor and digestibility. 

In making salads, everything should be crisp and cold both at 
the time of making and of serving. Greens should always be 
washed in cold water, and dried by vigorous swinging in a wire 
basket, or by pressing lightly between a clean folded towel. The 
salad should be kept on ice as long as possible, and the dressing 
should not be added until the moment of serving. Mayonnaise 
dressing is perhaps more generally used with meats than any other. 
Lettuce and other leaf salads are usually considered better with 
French dressing. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Yolk of 1 egg V 2 teaspoon salt 

1 cup oil 1/4 teaspoon paprika 

2 tablespoons vinegar or lemon juice 

Beat the egg yolk and add all the seasonings including the 
vinegar. Add the oil, a teaspoon at a time, and beat after each 
addition, using either a Dover egg-beater or a wire whip. If the 
dressing should curdle add a little more vinegar or lemon juice; 

167 t-i. 



Planned for a 
Family of Four 



or another egg yolk may be beaten in a clean bowl and then the 
curdled mixture beaten into it, a teaspoon at a time. The egg 
white may be beaten and added to thin the dressing instead of 
cream. 

Salads with mayonnaise dressing are especially adapted for 
meals in which there is no regular meat course. Salad with 
French dressing is better with a meal having a meat course and 
a rich dessert. 

COLORED MAYONNAISE 

To color Mayonnaise green add one tablespoon of ravigote herbs 
to the finished dressing; or chop parsley leaves very fine; pound 
them in a small quantity of lemon juice; strain and add the juice 
to the dressing. 

To color Mayonnaise red rub one scant tablespoon of lobster 
coral through a fine sieve and add it to the dressing. 

WHITE MAYONNAISE 

To make white Mayonnaise follow the ordinary directions, 
using lemon juice instead of vinegar, omitting the paprika and 
adding, when finished, a half cup of whipped cream or half an egg 
white beaten very stiff. 

COOKED DRESSING (MOCK MAYONNAISE)

PUDDINGS AND DESSERTS 

A LITTLE girl once defined desserts as "What you eat after 
you are through"; which is an excellent description of the 
heavy desserts often unwisely served after a meal furnishing all 
the nutriment needed. Desserts of milk and eggs, for instance, 
should not follow such meals; but, instead, some light dainty 
like lemon jelly. Mince pie or plum pudding should not "top off" 
a turkey dinner; better a simple salad and bonbons. When de- 
pended upon for their food value, however, custards and milk 
puddings are especially desirable for children, and for adults to 
whom eggs and milk are not acceptable in other forms. 

RICE PUDDING 

2 quarts milk % cup rice 

y 2 teaspoon salt % cup sugar 

Grated nutmeg or cinnamon 

Wash the rice; mix with half the milk and the salt and sugar 
and pour into a buttered pudding dish. Bake for several hours in a 
slow oven, stirring frequently and adding the rest of the milk. 
When the last milk is added, grate nutmeg over the top and let 
the pudding brown. 

A cup of seeded or seedless raisins may be baked in the pudding 
if desired. 

BOILED CUSTARD 

2 cups hot milk 2 tablespoons sugar 

Pinch of salt 2 eggs or yolks of 3 eggs 

l /2 teaspoon vanilla 

Put the milk on to heat in a double boiler. Beat the eggs thor- 
oughly with the sugar; into them pour the hot milk, stirring to 
prevent lumps. Return all to the double boiler and cook until 
the custard coats the spoon, but no longer. If the mixture should 
curdle, set the boiler in a pan of cold water and beat with a wire

my dessert.' 9 

Quaint Tales. 



202 



FROZEN DESSERTS 

Tj^ROZEN desserts are refreshing and wholesome and require 
* less time in preparation than the ordinary pudding. Success, 
moreover, is assured if a few very simple directions are followed. 

The essentials are to have the ice finely crushed and to use 
the right proportion of coarse rock salt. The finer the ice is 
crushed the quicker it melts, so for this reason it is important to 
have the ice broken into very small pieces. Enough should be 
broken for the entire freezing, as the process of turning the crank 
should not be interrupted. 

The can should be completely surrounded and covered with a 
mixture of ice and salt, using three parts ice to one of salt. Let 
it stand for a minute or two until the mixture begins to freeze to 
the inside of the can. Then turn the crank continuously until 
the mixture seems hard and heavy to move; then take out the 
dasher, scrape the frozen dessert from the sides of the can and 
pack it down closely. Put a cork in the opening of the cover, 
fill up the bucket with ice and salt, cover with burlap or piece 
of carpet and let stand an hour or more to ripen. 

Do not draw off any of the water until the freezing is completed, 
but add ice and salt as necessary. The melted water helps to 
freeze the mixture in the can and need not be drawn off at all if 
the dessert is to be served within an hour. 

The mixture should be prepared several hours before freezing 
and allowed to stand in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled. 
Can and dasher should be scalded before using. 

To crush the ice use an ice-crusher or a wooden mallet. Put 
the ice in a bag of burlap or canvas and pound into fine pieces. 
When the dessert is served, drain the salt that is in the can and 
save to use again.

BREAD-MAKING 

GOOD bread flour is a rich creamy yellow in color, is slightly 
gritty, and if squeezed hard in the hand, will not hold form, 
but will crumble apart upon release. Pastry flour contains more 
starch and less gluten (protein) than bread flour. It is paler in 
color, velvety to the touch, and retains the form of the hand after 
the pressure test. Most bread flours on the market are from 
blended spring and winter wheat, but the pressure test always 
holds good for selection. 

The three essentials in bread-making are flour, yeast and liquid. 
The yeast plant grows best in a temperature of 86 F. Bread 
should therefore be set to rise in a warm place, free from drafts. 
On the other hand, too great heat will kill the yeast plant and make 
the bread sour. About 75 F. is the most practical temperature 
to maintain. Two risings are sufficient if the ingredients have 
been well mixed. Dough permitted to rise until too light will 
be full of holes; bread baked before it is sufficiently light will 
be heavy. Bread must be well covered while rising to prevent a 
crust from forming on the top of the dough. Several thicknesses 
of clean towels are best for this purpose if a covered bread-raiser 
is not used. The bread in the pans must also be covered until 
it is put in the oven. 

The use of the patent bread-mixer shortens the work of bread- 
mixing and is therefore to be recommended. 

Kneading 

To knead the bread push the dough with the palm and draw it 
forward with the fingers. Use as little flour on the board as pos- 
sible as a soft dough makes better bread than a stiff dough. The 
more it is worked the finer will be the grain; but if a great deal of 
flour is worked in it will become hard. Knead until the dough is 
smooth and elastic to the touch: about twenty minutes is the 
usual time: about three minutes in the patent bread-mixer. 

221 ^ 



BREAD, HOT-CAKES, ETC. 



Baking 

Bread should be baked in a hot oven, but not in one that is too 
hot, as it should continue rising for the first fifteen minutes and if 
a hard crust is too quickly formed the rising is rendered difficult. 
The crust may be buttered ten minutes before the bread is re- 
moved from the oven: this will make it softer and more palatable. 

The best pans for baking are made of Russia iron and are four 
inches deep, four and a half wide, and ten long. The bread is done 
when it leaves the sides of the pan. The usual time allowed is 
fifty minutes. 

Biscuits require less time, but more heat. They should be baked 
in fifteen or twenty minutes. 

YEAST 

Yeast is a tiny, microscopic plant and like any other plant it 
needs light, heat and moisture for its growth. The temperature 
most favorable is from 70 to 75 F. If colder than this, its 
growth may be retarded altogether. Above 90 F. the conditions 
are favorable for the growth of lactic acid bacteria and the bread 
"sours." Sugar feeds the yeast; so when added to the sponge it 
hastens the growth. The starch of the flour is, to some extent, 
converted into sugar and thereby serves the same purpose. The 
soluble carbohydrates are acted upon by the yeast and con- 
verted into alcohol and carbon-dioxide. The carbon-dioxide gas 
becomes entangled in the gluten, and by expansion when heated, 
raises the bread. 

Compressed yeast is commercially made from grain in factories 
equipped with highly specialized and complicated machinery. The 
grains most used are corn, rye and barley malt. The grain is 
ground in a mill, mashed with water and the mash, cooked and 
allowed to cool, and finally fermented with yeast of a previous mak- 
ing. The result is the growth and multiplication of yeast cells. 

When the fermenting process has been carried to the proper 
stage, the yeast is separated from the fluid containing it, thoroughly 
washed with water, filtered, pressed, cut into cakes and wrapped. 
Every yeast cake contains millions of tiny yeast plants. 

Baking powder, like yeast, is a leavening agent which ^causes 
dough to rise by the expansion of imprisoned carbonic acid gas. 
The two principal, ingredients are an acid and an alkali, usually 
cream of tartar and bicarbonate of soda. These, when mixed 
together and moistened, react on each other and form gas bubbles 
which rise through the mixture, making it light and porous.

warm in winter and cool in summer; add two tablespoons of lard 
(or butter) and half the flour. Beat until smooth; then add bal- 
ance of the flour, or enough to make moderately firm dough, and 
last, the salt. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place in well- 
greased bowl and cover; set aside to rise over night, or about nine 
hours. In the morning mold into loaves. Fill well-greased pans 
half full; cover and let rise until light, or until loaves have doubled 
in bulk, which will be in about one and one half hours. Bake forty 
to fifty minutes. 

The half cake of yeast, which is left over, can be kept in good 
condition several days by rewrapping it in the tinfoil and keep- 
ing it in a cool, dry place.

CAKES 

A /THOUGH the mixing of cakes requires skill, the baking is 
even more important and needs careful judgment. The 
novice generally errs in using too hot an oven. 

For the sake of convenience, cakes may be divided into two 
main classes sponge cakes, or cakes without butter, and butter 
cakes. Other fats may be substituted for butter. Since butter 
becomes more difficult to digest upon being heated, sponge cakes, 
or the butterless kind, are to be preferred for children. 

Mixing 

Accuracy in the proportion of ingredients is absolutely neces- 
sary. To insure it, instead of depending on ordinary cups and 
spoons, no two of which hold exactly the same quantity, it is 
well to have utensils of regulation size a measuring cup divided 
into quarters and thirds, and holding half a pint, a few tea- and 
tablespoons, a case knife, and several mixing spoons. 

To mix sponge cake: Separate the yolks of the eggs from the 
whites, and beat the yolks with an egg-beater until they are thick 
and lemon-colored. Then add the sugar a little at a time, beating 
constantly. Now beat the whites until they are stiff and dry; 
add them and the sifted dry ingredients as directed in the recipe. 
Do this with as few motions as possible, as otherwise the air bub- 
bles enclosed in the mixture will be broken and all previous work 
undone. 

To mix butter cake: Use an earthen bowl for mixing such cakes, 
and a wooden mixing spoon with slits in it, to lighten the labor 
of creaming and stirring. Measure the dry ingredients; mix 
with the flour and. sift. Next break the eggs, dropping each 
into a saucer first in case the whole egg is to be used, so that if 
a stale egg happens to be among them it can be detected easily 
and in time. If the whites and yolks are to be used separately, 
divide them as you break the eggs, and beat both well before using 
the yolks until light and the whites until stiff and dry.

Then measure the butter, and if it is too hard to work well, 
let it stand in a warm place until it has become softened, but riot 
melted. If there is not time for this, warm the bowl by pouring 
hot water into it, letting it stand a few minutes, then emptying 
and wiping it dry. Do not let it get too warm, however, or the 
butter will become oily instead of creamy. 

If fruit is to be used, wash and dry it the day before. Dust 
with flour just before using, and mix with the hand till each 
piece is powdered, so that all will mix evenly with the dough 
instead of sinking to the bottom. 

Be sure to have all the ingredients ready before beginning to 
mix. Put the butter into the bowl ; work it until soft and creamy, 
and gradually add the sugar, beating constantly. Next add the 
egg, or the yolks, whichever the recipe specifies, and then the 
liquid. Work in the flour, a little at a time; or, if desired, add 
small quantities of flour and liquid alternately until the entire 
amount of each has been used. 



Baking 

Grease the pans carefully with butter or suet; dust lightly 
with flour; shake out the flour and pour in the batter. Then 
lift the pans into the oven. 

The essential point, of course, is that the oven have just the 
proper degree of heat for the kind of cake to be baked. If it is 
too hot at first, the cake will form a crust on the outside before 
rising to its full height, and in continuing to rise it will lift the 
top and break it, thus producing an unsightly loaf. If it is too 
cool, the cake will either fall, or rise and run over the sides of the 
pan, making the loaf not only unsightly, but of a coarse texture ' 

Cake should be watched while baking. If the oven door is 
opened and closed carefully there is no danger of causing the 
cake to fall. If the cake browns too quickly, cover it with paper 
and reduce the heat. Small cakes require a hotter oven than 
loaf cake. 

All cakes except pound cake shrink away from the edges of the 
pan when done, and in most cases no further test is necessary. 
Cakes may, however, be tested by sticking a fresh broom straw 
into the center; if it comes out clean the cake is done. 

If the cake cracks open on top too much flour has been used. 
If of coarse texture the cake has not been well beaten or the oven 
has been too slow.

PASTRY AND PIES 

r would be a waste of paper and space to warn the average 
American against the indigestibility of pastry, even at its 
best, and to explain that starch cells thus combined are 
armored against the influence of digestive fluids. Therefore 
every good cook endeavors to produce the best kind of pastry, 
light and flaky, and as digestible as possible; for heavy, soggy 
pastry is an endurance test for the digestion of even the most 
healthy person. 

The baking is especially important, because even good crust 
poorly baked is unfit to eat. The oven must be hot, with the 
greatest heat at the bottom, so that the under crust may be thor- 
oughly cooked, and cooked before the filling of the pie has a chance 
to soak in and make it soggy. 

Butter makes a more flaky crust than lard, although the recipes 
call for lard because that is generally more available; but other 
preparations, of which there are several on the market, may be 
used, 

PUFF-PASTE 

l / 2 pound butter l / 2 teaspoon salt 

l /2 pound flour l / 4 to l / 2 cup ice-water 

The secret of making good puff -paste is to have all the ingredients 
cold. Use a marble slab if possible and avoid making the paste 
on a warm, damp day. It should be made in a cool place, as 
it is necessary to keep the paste cold during the whole time of 
preparation. The recipe makes two pies or four crusts. 

Cut off one third of the butter and put the remaining two thirds 
in a bowl of ice- water. Divide this into four equal parts; pat 
each into a thin sheet and set them away on ice. Mix and sift the 
flour and salt; rub the reserved butter into it and make as stiff 
as possible with ice-water. Dust the slab with flour; turn the

PASTRY AND PIES 



paste upon it; knead for one minute; then stand on ice for five 
minutes. Roll the cold paste into a rectangular sheet about one 
third of an inch thick; place the cold butter in the center and fold 
the paste over it, first from the sides and then the ends, keeping 
the shape square and folding so that the butter is completely 
encased and cannot escape through any cracks as it is rolled. Roll 
out to one fourth inch thickness, keeping the rectangular shape and 
folding as before, but without butter. Continue rolling and fold- 
ing, enclosing a sheet of butter at every alternate folding until all 
four sheets are used. Then turn the folded side down and roll in 
one direction into a long narrow strip, keeping the edges as straight 
as possible. Fold the paste over, making three even layers. Then 
roll again and fold as before. Repeat the process until the dough 
has had six turns. Cut into the desired shapes and place on the 
ice for twenty minutes or longer before putting in the oven. 

If during the making the paste sticks to the board or pin, 
remove it immediately and stand on the ice until thoroughly 
chilled. Scrape the board clean; rub with a dry cloth and dust 
with fresh flour before trying again. Use as little flour as possible 
in rolling, but use enough to keep the paste dry. Roll with a 
light, even, long stroke in every direction, but never work the 
rolling pin back and forth as that movement toughens the paste 
and breaks the bubbles of air. 

The baking of puff-paste is almost as important as the rolling, 
and the oven must be very hot, with the greatest heat at the 
bottom, so that the paste will rise before it browns. If the paste 
should begin to scorch, open the draughts at once and cool the 
temperature by placing a pan of ice- water in the oven. 



HALF PUFF-PASTE FOR FRUIT PIES 

l /2 pound flour Ice-water 

2 ounces lard 4 ounces butter 

Pinch of salt 

Sift Uie flour and salt; cut into it the lard; mix to a dough with 
cold water. Flour the pastry slab or pie board; turn out the paste; 
roll half an inch thick; sprinkle lightly with flour and roll again 
Lay on the butter; fold the crust over; roll as before; dust with 
flour; fold and roll again. Repeat the process once more; set 
in a cool plae** for half an hour or longer; give another roll and the 
paste is readj for use. It should make four single crusts.

PLAIN PASTE 

l l /2 cups flour (sifted) 1/2 cup lard 

J /2 teaspoon salt 3 J /2 tablespoons coid water 

Sift the flour and salt, then cut in the shortening with two 
knives until it looks mealy. Add the water gradually, cutting 
it in with a knife. Flour the bottom of the pan; roll out the crust 
and line the bottom of the pan with it. Trim off the edges; roll 
them out; form into a long strip and press around the edge of 
the crust, moistening it slightly with water first to make the 
dough adhere. Fill and bake in a quick oven, having the greatest 
heat at the bottom. A gas stove is more satisfactory for pies 
than a coal stove. The recipe makes two single crusts. 



TARTLETS 

Roll puff-paste one eighth of an inch thick; cut it into squares; 
turn the points together into the middle and press slightly to make 
them stay. Bake until thoroughly done; place a spoonful oi 
jam in the center of each; cover the jam with meringue and brown 
the meringue in a quick oven.

Repeat the layers until the dish is full and cover with chopped nuts 
and narrow strips of the puff-paste. Bake slowly for an hour 
or more. 

PEACH CRUSTS 

Roll puff-paste one-eighth of an inch thick; cut in two-and-a- 
half-inch squares and bake in a hot oven. Cool; press down the 
centers and place in each a half of a canned peach, drained from 
its syrup. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and squeeze a little 
lemon juice into each cavity.

CEREALS 

^T^HE cereal grains wheat, corn, rice, oats, rye, barley furnish 
* the principal part of the world's food supply, being culti- 
vated practically everywhere except in the Arctic regions. They 
provide about one-quarter of the food consumed by the average 
American family. The word cereal is derived from the name of 
the Roman goddess of grain Ceres. 

In the grain or seed kernels of tall grasses lie the living germs 
of the plant, surrounded by the food necessary for their growth. 
It is this food which supplies the world's table with breakfast 
foods and cereal foods of all kinds. The cereal grains are rich in 
starch,* and supply an abundance of carbohydrate, or fuel-and- 
energy food. They contain also much protein, or muscle-forming 
food, and several per cent of fat (oils), in addition to mineral 
salts and vitamins. 

With whole milk, cereals supply the elements of nutrition in 
the most desirable proportions, and make excellent breakfast 
foods. As with all starchy foods, thoroughness of cooking is a 
factor which has an important bearing upon digestibility. It is 
unfortunate that cereals are so often served for breakfast hurriedly 
prepared. They should, whenever possible, be cooked over night; 
and for this reason the use of the fireless cooker is to be especially 
recommended. The ready-cooked breakfast- foods are not more 
digestible than any thoroughly cooked cereal, though usually 
higher in price. Where there is no fireless cooker, however, and 
where the saving of fuel is to be considered, they are not necessarily 
more expensive. 

OATMEAL PORRIDGE 

As oatmeal is ground in different grades of coarseness, the time 
for cooking varies and it is best to follow the directions given on 
the packages. The meal should be cooked until soft, but should

not be mushy. Cook in a double boiler the required time. Keep 
covered until done; then remove the cover and let the moisture 
escape. 

OATMEAL WITH CHEESE 

1 cup oatmeal 1 teaspoon salt 

Water 1 tablespoon butter 

1 cup grated cheese 

Cook the oatmeal over night and just l>efore serving add the 
butter and cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and serve at 
once. 

BAKED APPLE WITH OATMEAL 

Pare and core the apples and fill the core space with left-over 
oatmeal mush. Put the apples in a baking dish; sprinkle with 
sugar; pour a little water into the bottom of the pan and bake in 
a moderate oven until the apples are tender. Serve warm with 
cream for breakfast or luncheon. 



WHEAT CEREALS 

Wheat cereals, like oatmeal, are best cooked by following the 
directions on the package. Most of them are greatly improved 
by the addition of a little milk or by ja few chopped dates or 
whole sultana raisins. 



CORN-MEAL MUSH 

1 cup corn meal 1 teaspoon salt 

1 cup cold water 1 pint boiling water 

Mix together the corn meal and salt and add the cold water 
gradually, stirring until smooth. Pour this mixture into the 
boiling water and cook in a double boiler from three to five hours. 
Serve hot with cream and sugar. 

FRIED MUSH 

Pour hot corn meal into a square dish that has been rinsed in 
cold water. When the mush is cold cut it into slices one hah* inch

Put the rice in a strainer; place the strainer over a bowl nearly 
full of cold water; rub the rice; lift the strainer from the bowl and 
change the water. Repeat the process until the water in the bowl 
is clear. Have the two quarts of water boiling briskly; add the 
rice and salt gradually so as not to check the ebullition; boil 
twenty minutes or until soft; drain through a colander and place 
the colander over boiling water for ten minutes to steam. Every 
grain will be distinct and tender. 

If desired, the rice may be brought to a boil in a little milk 
instead of being steamed, though in this case the grains may not 
remain separate. 

Serve as a vegetable with butter and salt, or as a cereal with 
cream and sugar.

CANDY 

THE "sweet tooth" is increasing in size in America. Sugar 
is a valuable food; and pure candies, rightly used, are good 
for children. The best time to eat candy is toward the end of a 
meal. Its abuse is in much munching between meals, which 
destroys the appetite for more needed food. 

FONDANT 

2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup water 

l /4 saltspoon cream of tartar 

Put the ingredients in a copper or granite saucepan; stir until 
the sugar is dissolved, but no longer.* Boil until the mixture makes 
a very soft ball when dropped in cold water. After it has boiled 
a few minutes sugar will adhere to the sides of the kettle: this 
should be washed off as soon as it forms, with the hand first dipped 
in cold water. Pour the mixture slowly on a moist marble slab or 
large platter; let it cool until pressure with the finger leaves a dent 
on the surface. If stirred while too warm or if cooked too long it 
will granulate and must be recooked, adding more water. When 
it will dent work the mass with a wooden spoon or spatula, keep- 
ing the mass in the center as much as possible. Continue to stir 
until creamy; then work with the hands until perfectly smooth. 
Put in a bowl; cover with oiled paper to exclude the air and let 
stand for twenty-four hours. 

Make into balls for cream chocolates and centers of walnut 
creams, date creams, etc., adding flavoring as desired. For cocoa- 
nut creams stir in grated or dried cocoanut. 

QUICK FONDANT 

White of 1 egg Confectioners' sugar 

Flavoring 

Beat the egg very stiff; stir in as much confectioners' sugar as 
the egg will hold; flavor and mold into small balls. 

* A candy thermometer does away with much guesswork. Special directions 
are usually furnished with such conveniences.

CHOCOLATE CREAMS 

Roll fondant into balls; dip them in melted chocolate and stand 
them to dry on waxed paper. 

The necessary utensils are a wire fork and a very small double 
boiler. The chocolate when melted should come nearly to the 
top of the inner boiler. Melt the chocolate; cool to about 80 F.; 
drop a ball of fondant into the chocolate; with a fork push it below 
the surface; remove carefully with the fork. 



CHOCOLATE CREAM MINTS 

Melt fondant over hot water; flavor with oil of peppermint and 
drop from the tip of a spoon on waxed paper. When cool dip in 
melted chocolate as directed under the recipe for Chocolate Creams.

FRUIT 

^ I ^IIE old saying, "an apple a day keeps the doctor away," had 
-- a better foundation than the people who originated its trite- 
ness realized, for only by very recent experimentation has it been 
found what an important place fruit has in the diet, not only for 
bulk or roughage, but for the mineral substances and vitamins 
so essential to health. The juices of lemons, oranges and grape 
fruit are particularly rich sources of vitamins. 

So from those who advocate a diet of cereals, fruits, and nuts to 
those who enjoy three "square" meals a day, people are coming 
more and more to realize the importance of fruit in the daily meal. 
In general it may be said that fruits are wholesome, palatable, 
and attractive additions to the menu. Fresh fruits, of course, are 
largely composed of water; but dried fruits and many preserves 
are much more concentrated, comparing favorably with cereals 
and dried vegetable foods. Fruits contain carbohydrates, con- 
siderable mineral matter and acid, and when eaten raw do much 
to stimulate a sluggish digestion. 

Several methods of preparing fruit for the table will be discussed 
in this chapter and others will be found in the chapters on "Appe- 
tizers," "Puddings and Desserts," "Salads," and "Canning and 
Preserving." 

BAKED APPLES 

Wash and core and if desired pare the apples. Place them in 
a shallow baking dish and fill the cavities with sugar, sugar and 
spice, sugar and seeded raisins, or sugar and chopped nuts. 
Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over the apples; cover the bottom 
of the pan with water and bake about thirty minutes or until 
tender. Serve with cream or with lemon sauce. 

APPLE SAUCE 

See chapter on "Sauces."

FRIED APPLES 

Cut slices a hah* inch thick across the apple, removing neither 
skin nor core; or cut the apples in quarters, removing both skin 
and core. Saute them in butter or drippings until tender; serve 
with crisp bacon. 

STEWED PEACHES 

Pare and quarter the peaches, discarding the stones. Bring 
to the boiling point one cup of sugar and one cup of water; cook 
four minutes; add the peaches and cook until tender. 

Pears, plums and apricots may be cooked in the same way, 
though the plums may require more sugar. 

BAKED PEACHES 

Plunge the peaches into boiling water to loosen the skins. 
Remove the skins; cut the peaches in half, discarding tne stones, 
and lay them, cut side up, in a shallow baking dish. Fill the 
cavities with butter and sugar, a few drops of lemon juice and a 
sprinkling of cinnamon or nutmeg. Bake twenty minutes and 
serve on buttered toast or crackers. 

BAKED PEARS 

Wash the pears, and unless they are small quarter and core 
them. Place them in a deep pudding dish, well sprinkled with 
sugar. Add water sufficient to keep them from burning; cover 
and bake for two or three hours in a slow oven. If desired, a 
piece of stick cinnamon may be put in the pan with the pears; 
this will improve the flavor. 

BAKED QUINCES 

Wash, quarter, core and pare the quinces. Place them, cut 
side up, in a shallow baking dish, filling the cavities with sugar, 
mixed with a little grated lemon rind or lemon juice. Cover 
the bottom of the dish with water and bake in a moderate oven 
until soft, basting frequently. Serve hot with butter and sugar. 

STEWED QUINCES 

Wash the quinces, pare and core them and cut them into 
eighths. Cover with cold water and let them come slowly to a

boil, removing the scum that rises. When nearly soft add one 
cup of sugar for every pint of fruit and one cup of apples, pared 
and cut into eighths. Boil until both apples and quinces are 
tender. 

STEWED RHUBARB 

Select the strawberry rhubarb in preference to the white; 
wash it, and unless it is very old, do not peel it. Simply remove 
the ends and cut the stalk into small pieces. Pour boiling water 
on the rhubarb; drain and put it in a saucepan over the fire, 
covering it well with sugar and adding only enough water to keep 
it from burning. Cook until soft but not until the pieces have 
lost their identity. The quantity of sugar will have to be varied 
according to the age of the rhubarb. 

STEWED BLACKBERRIES 

Wash and stem the blackberries; add a little water and stew 
until tender. Just before they are done sweeten to taste. 

Some cooks thicken the juice with a little cornstarch thinned in 
water. If this is done the blackberries must boil for an extra 
minute or two until the cornstarch is cooked. 

STEWED RASPBERRIES 
Follow the recipe for Stewed Blackberries. 

STEWED CHERRIES 

Select pie cherries, preferably the morello cherries; stone them 
or not as desired and follow the directions for Stewed Black- 
berries. 

STEWED CRANBERRIES 
See chapter on "Sauces." 

DRIED FRUITS 

To cook dried fruits thoroughly they should after careful wash- 
ing be soaked over night. Next morning put them over the fire 
in the water in which they have been soaked; bring to a boil; 
then simmer slowly until the fruit is thoroughly cooked but not 
broken. Sweeten to taste. Very much less sugar will be needed 
than for fresh fruit.

CANNING AND PRESERVING 



* We eat what we can; and what we can'Z, we can." 

The Punster. 



316 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 

IT is said that modern canning was first thought of when a jar 
of perfectly preserved fruit was found embedded in a heap of 
lava among the ruins of Pompeii. Very evidently the heat of the 
molten lava, together with the exclusion of air, had kept the con- 
tents of the jar from "spoiling. " So experiments were tried, and 
for many years it was thought that exclusion of air would "keep" 
food. But scientists have proved that floating about in the air 
there are billions of billions of micro-organisms known as yeasts, 
molds, and bacteria, which attack foods and cause fermentation 
or "spoiling." And it may be added, in passing, that not all 
such tiny organisms are destructive, but many are helpful, doing 
such things as making milk into cheese, changing cider to vinegar, 
and performing a multiplicity of other beneficial services for 
mankind. 

The secret of successful canning and preserving lies in destroy- 
ing the micro-organisms which "spoil" food. Yeasts and molds 
are killed at a temperature of 160 F. Bacteria are destroyed at 
212 F., or the boiling point. If this temperature is maintained 
the proper length of time, they are rendered sterile, or incapable 
of growing or reproducing, or of throwing off spores which in turn 
will develop into bacteria. Spores are more difficult to kill than 
bacteria ; therefore, if the heat does not penetrate the whole mass 
some parts may not be sterilized and will ferment. 

Methods. There are two methods of sterilizing commonly used 
in home canning: the cold-pack; and the open-kettle, or hot-pack. 

The cold-pack method is greatly to be preferred, because the 
food is packed in the containers before cooking, and is not touched 
again with spoons or other utensils. In the open-kettle method, 
the food is cooked before it is put into the jars, and there is 

317 L-L 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 



Planned for a

always danger of bacteria and spores being introduced on spoons 
and other utensils. The simplicity of the cold-pack method re- 
commends it. Fruits are put in syrups. Vegetables require 
only salt for flavoring and water to fill the containers. 

THE COLD-PACK METHOD 

In the cold-pack process, after the jars are filled with the pre- 
pared food, they are placed in the apparatus to be used for sterilizing. 
^^^ People who do home canning may 

choose from among several types of 
apparatus, according to their needs and 
means. 

1. The Hot-Water-Bath CannerA 
serviceable cold-pack canning outfit may 
be made of equipment found in almost 
any household. A wash-boiler, or any 
tight-covered utensil, which is deep 
enough to allow the water to reach to 




WASH-BOILER WITH RACK FOR 
JARS 



HOME-MADE RACK FOR WASH- 
BOILER 



the tops of the jars when a false bottom 
is beneath them, may be used for sterili- 
zation. A wire or wooden rack, or a milk- 
carrier, makes a good false bottom, 
permitting the water to circulate under- 
neath the jars. Several inexpensive 
canners of this type are on the market. 

2. The Water-heal Conner. This is much more desirable 
than the above, as the period of sterilization is shorter and less 
fuel is required; and less water is needed, making lifting lighter. 

The water-seal canner consists of two con- 
tainers, one fitting within the other, and 
a cover which extends into the space 
between the outer and inner container. 
The water-jacket thus formed makes it 
possible for the temperature within the 
container to be raised above 212 F., and 
since steam is hotter than boiling water, 
is more quickly accomplished. Such outfits are 
not expensive. 

Steam-Pressure Canners. Canning is very rapid when sterili- 
zation is done in steam maintained at a pressure. There are several 
canners of this type. Each has a pressure gauge and safety-valve; 

318 L-L 




A WATER-SEAL OUTFIT 
sterilization is more quickly 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 



and they carry from five to thirty pounds of steam-pressure. They 
are made of aluminum and of iron; and, when properly equipped, 
are very satisfactory either for canning or for general cooking. 

Utensils. It is important to plan so that whatever may be 
needed will be ready for use. For home canning, glass jars are 
more satisfactory than tin. All types of jars which seal readily 
may be used. Those having glass tops are much more satisfactory 
than those with screw caps. The new " Victory" jar is to be 
preferred to all others, having a wide mouth, glass top, and no 
curves. 

Tests for Jars. Jars should be tested before they are used. 
With glass top, fit cover to jar. If top rocks when tapped it should 
not be used on that jar. If the wire clamp is either too tight or too 
loose it should be taken off and bent until it goes into place with 
a light snap. All sharp edges on top and jar should be filed or 
scraped off. With screw-top jars, screw the top on lightly without 
the rubber. If thumb nail can be inserted between top and jar, 
the cover is defective. If the edge is only slightly uneven it can 
be bent so that it is usable. Put on the rubber, and screw top 
on tightly, and then pull the rubber out. If the rubber returns 
to place, the top does not fit properly, and should not be used on 
that jar. 

Tests for Rubbers. Buy new rubbers every year, as they dete- 
riorate from one season to another. A good rubber will return to 
its original size when stretched. WTien pinched it does not crease. 
It should fit the neck of the jar snugly, and be fairly wide and 
thick. It is cheaper to discard a doubtful rubber than to lose a 
jar of canned goods. 

Preparation. There are certain essentials for the successful 
canning of fruits or vegetables. These include clean, fresh 
materials, perfect containers, good rubber rings, heating for 
sufficient time to insure preservation, and air-tight sealing. These 
essentials must be secured in any method of canning. 

Definitions of Terms. The most important steps in the cold- 
pack method are: (1) blanching; (2) cold-dipping; (3) packing 
in clean containers, adding hot water or syrup at once, then 
immediately half sealing; and (4) processing in the sterilizer. 
Spoilage of food is nearly always due to carelessness in one of 
these steps. 

1. Blanching consists in plunging the fruits or vegetables into 
boiling water, or exposing them to steam for a short time. This 
is necessary with all vegetables and some fruits. It insures 

319 L-L 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 




thorough cleansing, and removes objectionable odors and flavors 
and excess acids. It starts the flow of coloring matter; it reduces 
the bulk of greens, and causes shrinkage of fruits, increasing the 
quantity which may be packed in a container. 

For blanching in boiling water, place the food in a wire basket 
or piece of cheesecloth. The blanching time varies from one to 
fifteen minutes, as shown in the time-table on 
page 323, and the products should be kept 
under water the whole period. 

Spinach and other greens should not be 
blanched in hot water, but in steam to pre- 
vent the loss of the mineral salts, volatile oils, 
and other valuable substances. Place such 
vegetables in a colander and set this in a ves- 
sel which has a tightly fitting cover. In this 
BLANCHING GREENS m vessel there should be an inch or two of water, 

but it should not touch the greens. 
In canning berries and all soft fruits, blanching is dispensed with. 

2. Cold-dipping. When the blanching is complete remove the 
vegetables or fruits and plunge them once or twice into cold water 
the colder the better. The cold dip hardens the pulp under the 
skin so that the products are not injured by peeling. It also sets 
the coloring matter. Do not allow the products to stand in cold 
water. 

Always blanch and cold-dip only enough material to fill one or 
two jars at a time. 

3. Packing into jars should immediately follow. Cover contents 
with boiling water or syrup (see page 321). As soon as the jar is 
filled, put the rubber and cap in place. With glass-top jars place 
the wire that clamps on the cover just up to the first glass eleva- 
tion not between the two glass elevations, as this might make 
too great pressure, causing the lid to break. 

With Mason jars, screw top on with thumb and little finger 
which will not be strong enough to make it too tight. 

4. Processing is the sterilization treatment. In using the hot- 
water-bath canner, count from the time the water begins to boil. 
The water should be hot when the jars are put in. With the water- 
seal canner, count when the thermometer reaches 214 F. There 
is a clever little device substituted for a thermometer on some 
water-seal outfits. It is a whistle which blows when the water is 
hot enough for beginning to count time. Special directions are sup- 
plied with steam pressure canners and aluminum pressure cookers.

.4 reliable alarm clock, set to ring at the end of the sterilization 
period, is a great convenience. 

HOW TO PROCEED 

Vegetables. Prepare vegetables by blanching and cold dipping. 
Pack jars to within an inch of top. Add one level teaspoonful 
salt to each quart jar. Fill with boiling water. Process according 
to time-table for sterilizing. 

Fruits. With some exceptions, as shown in the time-table on 
page 323, fruits should be blanched before canning. When fruits 
are intended for table use, syrup should be poured over them to 
fill the jars. Consult time-table for length of time to sterilize. 

Syrups. Three grades of syrups are used in canning, according 
to the degree* of sweetness desired : 

Thin ........ 1 part sugar to 4 parts water. 

Medium ..... 1 part sugar to 2 parts water. 

Thick ....... 1 part sugar to 1 part water. 

Boil until all the sugar is dissolved. 
Use thin syrup with sweet fruits. 
Use medium syrup with sour fruits. 
Thick syrup is used in preserving. 

SUMMARY 

1. Prepare vegetables or fruits. 

2. Blanch and cold-dip. 

3. Pack in jars, using a wooden paddle to place pieces in position. 

4. Fill jars with hot water or syrup. 

5. Partly seal jars and place them in the sterilizer. If hot-water 
bath is used, have a hot bath deep enough to reach within an inch 
of covers. Count time from when water begins to boil. 

G. Process according to time-table, page 323. 

7. Remove jars as soon as time is up, and tighten covers. Do 
not further tighten covers of screw cap jars after the jars have 
become cold, as heat softens the rubber and makes it stick, forming 
a seal. Tightening the top after cooling may break the rubber 
seal, letting into the jar some germ-laden air. Occasionally the 
cover will cut off the outer edge of a rubber, but it will do no harm 
if the rubber is under the edge so that a seal may be formed. 

* A saccharometer, or sugar gauge, does away with guess-work as to the density 
of syrups. 

321 L-L 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 



If for any reason a cover is removed, return the jar to the canner to 
be re-sterilized, for twenty to thirty minutes. 

8. Set jars upside down to test for leakage. Cover with a 
towel, for a draft of air may cause sudden contraction which will 
break the glass. 

9. Wash each jar, label and store away in a dry place, dark, if 
possible, to prevent change of color. Paper wrappings not only 
exclude light, but prevent mold which causes rubber to decay. 

NOTE. All jars should be washed thoroughly. If jars that 
have contained spoiled material are to be used, special care should 
be taken in cleansing them. Do not use the water in which they 
have been washed for washing other jars. Sterilize them and their 
covers by boiling* one hour, or "process" in a steam-pressure 
cooker from fifteen to thirty minutes. If the jars are of the metal 
screw-cap type, use new lids. 

TIME-TABLE FOR BLANCHING AND STERILIZING 

The following time-table shows blanching time for various 
vegetables and fruits, and also sterilizing time in the hot-water-bath 
canner, and in equipment for sterilization by the water-seal method, 
the steam-pressure method and the steam-cooker method. 

The time given in this table is for quart jars. Add 30 minutes 
for two-quart jars and deduct 5 minutes for pint jars. 

The time given is for fresh, sound and firm vegetables. Increase 
the time of sterilization by adding one-fifth for vegetables which 
have been gathered more than 24 hours. 

The time given is for altitudes up to 1000 feet above sea level. 
For higher altitudes increase the time in hot-water bath 10 per 
cent for each additional 500 feet. For example, if the time is 
given as 120 minutes in the table and your location is 1500 feet 
above sea level, the time should be made 132 minutes. 

Neither home-made nor commercial hot-water-bath outfits are 
entirely satisfactory, however, for canning at very high altitudes, 
as the temperature of water in them does not reach 212 F. In 
such localities water-seal and steam-pressure outfits are advisable, 
as they give higher temperatures. 

At nigh altitudes the boiling point of water is below 212 F. 
At moderate elevations satisfactory results may be obtained in 
the use of the hot- water bath by increasing the time of sterilization 
10 per cent.

OPEN-KETTLE METHOD 

Canning in the preserving kettle is less satisfactory than by the 
cold-pack method; but is sometimes considered easier, especially 
for small fruits, and it must be used in making jams, marmalades, 
etc., because some evaporation is necessary to reduce the products 
to the right consistency. Cook the fruit according to the direc- 
tions and see that all jars, covers and utensils are carefully sterilized. 

To sterilize saucepans, spoons, jars, covers, straining bags, and

Famof 



other articles, put them over the fire in cold water, heat gradually, 
and let boil for ten or fifteen minutes. The jars must be taken 
one at a time from the boiling water, and not until the moment 
each is to be filled. When ready to put the fruit in the jars, put 
a broad skimmer under one, lift it and drain off the water. Set 
it in a shallow pan of boiling water or wrap it well in a heavy 
towel wrung out of boiling water; fill to overflowing with the 
fruit and slip a silver-plated knife around the inside of the jar to 
make sure that fruit and juice are solidly packed. Wipe the rim 
of the jar; dip the rubber ring in boiling water, place it on the 
jar; cover and remove the jar, placing it upside-down on a board, 
well out of drafts until cool. Then tighten the covers, if screw 
covers are used; wipe the jars with a wet cloth, and stand on 
shelves in a cool, dark closet. 

The success of canning depends upon absolute sterilization and 
not upon the amount of sugar or cooking. Any proportion of 
sugar may be used, or fruit may be canned without the addition 
of any sugar. Juicy fruits, such as berries and cherries, require 
little or no water. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Never use old rubbers or lids that are bent, and be sure that lids 
are boiled and rubbers dipped in boiling water one at a time just 
before using. 

Fruit must be carefully picked and washed, and all stems re- 
moved, and only as much as can be cooked while it still retains 
its color and crispness should be prepared. If practicable pare the 
fruit with a silver knife. Peaches, plums, and tomatoes may be 
readily skinned after a three-minute plunge in boiling water. 
Where fruit like quinces and hard pears must be first boiled in 
clear water, the fruit should be dropped in cold water made slightly 
acid with lemon to keep the fruit from discoloring. 

When fruit is preserved with a large amount of sugar (a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit) it does not need to be sealed in air- 
tight jars; because bacteria do not readily form in the thick, 
sugary syrup. It is, however, best kept in small sealed jars, since 
molds are very likely to form. 

Under no circumstances should preserving powders be used. In 
most cases they are injurious, and in any case are the resort of the 
cook who is too lazy to take the proper precautions. 

NOTE. In most of the following recipes for canning, directions 

324 L-I, 



Famiiy d ofFo a ur CANNING AND PRESERVING 

are given for the Open-Kettle Method; but in almost every case 
the canning may be better done by the Cold-Pack Method. 



CANNED APPLE SAUCE 

Cut tart apples into eighths, removing cores. Put them in the 
preserving kettle with one cup of water for each quart apples. 
Cover, and let cook gently until tender. Press through a colander 
to remove skins. Re-heat in the preserving kettle, allowing one- 
quarter cup sugar to each pint of apple sauce. Stir to prevent 
burning. Fill hot sterilized jars to overflowing and seal immedi- 
ately. If desired, a pinch of cinnamon may be added with the 
sugar. 



CANNED PEARS 

Pears should be firm to retain their form after cooking. It is 
not necessary to pare them. Cut in halves; remove cores. Drop 
into cold water to prevent their turning dark in color. Weigh 
them. Put one-third their weight of sugar in the preserving 
kettle. Add one pint water to each pound sugar. Boil five 
minutes. Add the pears. Cook gently until skin is readily 
pierced with a straw splint. Pack into hot sterilized jars, filled 
to overflowing with the boiling syrup. Seal immediately. Do 
not attempt to cook many pears at one time, for those that are 
cooked too long crumble and lose their form. Many people add 
a few slices of lemon, or a piece of ginger root for additional flavor. 
Bartlett pears are best for canning. 



CANNED RASPBERRIES 

6 quarts berries 1 quart sugar 

Put one quart of the fruit in the preserving kettle; heat slowly, 
crushing with a wooden potato masher; strain and press through 
a fine sieve. Return the juice and pulp to the kettle; add the 
sugar; stir until dissolved; then add the remaining quarts of 
berries. Boil ten minutes, counting from the time they begin to 
boil. Skim well while boiling, and put into jars as directed.

Measure the cherries after the stems have been removed; 
stone them or not, as desired. Put the sugar and water in the 
preserving kettle and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the 
cherries; bring slowly to a boil and cook ten minutes. 

CANNED GRAPES 

6 quarts grapes 1 quart sugar 

l /2 cup water 

Squeeze the pulp out of the skins; cook for five minutes; rub 
through a sieve fine enough to retain the seeds; return to the 
preserving kettle with the water and skins; bring slowly to the 

)iling point, removing the scum. Cook for fifteen minutes.

CANNED RHUBARB 

Wash the rhubarb thoroughly in pure water; cut it into pieces 
and pack it in sterilized jars. Cover with cold water; let it stand 
ten minutes; pour off the water; fill again to overflowing with 
fresh cold water; seal with sterilized rubber rings and covers, and 
set away in a cool, dark place. 



CANNED GOOSEBERRIES 

6 quarts berries 3 pints sugar 

1 **nt water 

Dissolve the sugar in the water, using three pints of sugar if 
the gooseberries are green and only half the quantity if they are 
ripe. Add the fruit and cook fifteen minutes. 

Green gooseberries may also be canned like rhubarb without 
sugar and sweetened when used. 



CANNED PLUMS 

4 quarts plums 1 quart sugar 

1 cup water 

Wash, drain and prick the plunis. Make a syrup of the sugar 
and water; put part of the fruit in the boiling syrup; cook five 
minutes; fill and seal the jars. Put more fruit in the syrup; 
remove and continue the process until all the fruit has been 
cooked. 

CANNED PEACHES 

8 quarts peaches 1 quart sugar 

3 quarts water 

Make a syrup of the sugar and water; bring to a boil; skim it 
and draw the kettle aside where the syrup will keep hot but not 
boil. 

Pare the peaches, cutting them in half or not as desired. If 
in half leave one or two whole peaches for every jar, as the kernel 
improves the flavor. Put a layer of fruit in the kettle; when it 
begins to boil skim carefully; boil gently for ten minutes; put 
in jars and seal. Then cook more of the fruit in similar fashion. 
If the fruit is not fully ripe it may require a longer time to cook.

CANNED CRAB APPLES 

3 quarts apples 3 cups sugar 

I quart water 

Boil the syrup and skim it; add the fruit and cook gently until 
tender. It will take from twenty to fifty minutes, according to 
the kind of apple. 

CANNED QUINCES 

2 quarts quinces 3 cups sugar 

1 quart water 

Wash and drain the quinces; pare, quarter and core them and 
drop the pieces into cold water to which a little lemon juice has 
been added. Put the fruit over the fire with cold water to cover 
it; heat slowly and simmer gently until the fruit is tender. With 
a silver fork remove each piece as soon as it is tender and drain 
them on a platter. Strain the water in which the fruit was cooked; 
put one quart of it in the kettle with the sugar; bring to a boil 
and skim. Add the cooked fruit and boil gently for about twenty 
minutes. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE 

Select ripe fruit; pare and remove the eyes; slice them in half- 
inch slices and cut each slice into quarters. Fill the jars with 
fruit, within an inch of the top. Make a syrup of sugar and water 
in the proportion of a cup of sugar to a pint of water; fill the jars 
with this up to the top and process by the cold-pack method. 
See time-table for length of period of sterilization. 

CANNING VEGETABLES 

In canning vegetables the same precautions must be observed 
as in canning fruit and it is safer to use jars that have either glass 
tops, or tops without porcelain lining. Corn should be pressed 
or cut from the cob and packed at once into jars, and, in order to 
insure its keeping, the cold-pack method should be followed. 
See directions on page 318. 

Peas may be packed in the same way as corn, but each jar must 
be filled with water; string beans require a shorter period of 

328 L-L 



gimiiy d of Four CANNING AND PRESERVING 

cooking, but the jar manipulation is the same. See time-table, 
page 323. Add a teaspoon of salt to each jar of vegetables. 

CANNED TOMATOES 

Wash the tomatoes and plunge them in boiling water for about 
five minutes. Pare and cut them into small pieces; put them in 
the preserving kettle over the fire and heat slowly, stirring fre- 
quently to prevent their sticking, and removing the scum that rises. 
Boil for thirty minutes, counting from the time the whole mass 
begins to boil. Put in sterilized jars and seal. If canning by the 
cold-pack method, blanch, cold dip, and peel tomatoes; pack the 
best into the jars. Put the imperfect and broken pieces in the 
preserving kettle. Boil ten minutes. Strain, and pour over the 
tomatoes packed in the jars. Add one teaspoon salt to each jar. 
Process in sterilizer according to time-table. 

CANNED MUSHROOMS 

Wash the mushrooms carefully, but do not peel them. Pack 
them closely in glass jars; adjust the rubbers, and lay the lids on 
loosely. Stand the jars in the sterilizer. Cover. If hot-water- 
bath canner is used, bring the water to the boiling point and boil 
one hour and a half. If water-seal canner is used, boil one hour. 
If steam-pressure canner is used, boil thirty minutes. By this 
time, the mushrooms will have wilted down; so fill two jars by 
means of a third. Fill the jars to overflowing with boiling water. 
Return to sterilizer and process one-half hour, 

PRESERVING FRUIT 

Some fruits, such as strawberries, sour cherries, sour plums, 
etc., are better preserved with a large amount of sugar than 
simply canned. They are richer, however, and cannot be eaten 
in such abundance as canned fruits. The object in making pre- 
serves is to have the fruit permeated with a syrup sufficiently 
dense to prevent the entrance of bacteria. The cooking should 
be done slowly, below the boiling point, until both fruit and the 
surrounding syrup are clear and transparent. 

A thick coating of paraffin makes a good cover. Melt the 
paraffin and pour it hot over the cold preserves. Allow the paraffin 
to become cold before covering the glasses with the lids. Wipe 
the outside of the glasses, label, and store in a cool, dry place.

ORANGE MARMALADE 



1 dozen oranges Vz dozen lemons 

Sugar and water 

Select fruit that is firm and not too ripe. Omit the lemons if 
preferred. With a sharp knife slice the fruit very thin, throwing 
away the ends and removing the seeds. Weigh, and to each 
pound of fruit add two pints of cold water. Let this stand over 
night; then boil the fruit in the same water until it is tender. 
Remove from the fire; weigh again; and to each pound of fruit 
and liquid add one pound of sugar. Boil until the fruit is trans- 
parent and the juice a rich syrup. 

SPICED CURRANTS 

5 pounds currants 2 tablespoons cinnamon 

4 pounds brown sugar 2 tablespoons cloves 

1 pint vinegar 

Wash the currants and remove the stems. Place them with 
the other ingredients in a preserving kettle and boil gently for 
two hours. This makes five pint cans. 

PRESERVED YELLOW TOMATOES 

4 pounds small yellow tomatoes l /2 cup boiling water 

3 pounds sugar Juice and rind of 1 lemon 

Wash and dry the tomatoes and prick each one in five or six 
places. Stir the sugar in the water until dissolved; add the 
tomatoes and cook until clear. When half done add the lemon 
juice and the rind sliced very thin. When the fruit is clear, 
remove it with a skimmer; put in small jars, filling them two- 
thirds full. Boil the syrup fast for a few minutes longer or until 
thick and syrupy; fill up the jars; cover with a cloth until the 
next day; then cover closely and stand away in a cool place. 

RAISIN COMPOTE 

3 navel oranges 3 pints currants 

l l / 2 pounds seeded raisins 3 cups cold water 

3 cups sugar 

Prepare the oranges as for marmalade and let them soak over 
night in the water. In the morning pick and wash the currants

and add them with the washed raisins and sugar to the oranges; 
boil hard for about two hours and put in glass jars, closing them 
while hot. Serve with meat. 

SPICED PEARS 

4 pounds fruit l /2 ounce whole allspice 

3 pounds sugar J /2 ounce whole cloves 

1 pint vinegar Vfe stick cinnamon 

Tie the spices in a small cheesecloth bag; boil ten minutes with 
the vinegar and sugar. Skim, add fruit and cook until tender. 
Remove the fruit; boil down the sugar and vinegar until syrupy; 
pour over the fruit in jars and seal. 

Peaches, grapes, plums, cantaloup, quinces, watermelon rind 
and cucumbers may be prepared in the same way. 

PICKLED CHERRIES 

1 pound sugar 1 pint vinegar 

Remove all specked cherries. Wash and stem. Bring vinegar 
to the boiling point, add the sugar, stir until dissolved. The 
cherries may be thrown into the boiling liquid, simmered three 
minutes, and put into sterilized jar; but the cold-pack method is 
much better. Use the vinegar syrup in place of plain syrup as 
directed. Process five minutes. 

The morello cherries are most satisfactory for pickling, and 
can be used in many places instead of maraschino cherries for 
decorating and flavoring. 

CITRON PRESERVE 

6 pounds citron rind l ! / 2 quarts water 

6 pounds sugar 4 lemons

Peel and cut the rind into pieces of uniform size, rejecting all 
the seeds. Tie the ginger root in a piece of muslin so that it can be 
readily removed. Put the sugar, water, lemon juice and ginger 
hi a kettle; stir until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup clear. 
Remove any scum that rises and take out the bag of ginger. Add 
the citron and cook until it is clear but not soft enough to fall 
apart. Pour into sterilized jars and seal while hot. 

The ginger may be omitted if the flavor of ginger is not

APPLE BUTTER 

5 quarts apple pulp 1 teaspoon ground cloves 

10 quarts new sweet cider 1 teaspoon ground allspice 

Brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 

The apples should be tart and the cider not more than two 
days old. Boil the cider down one half before measuring; put 
the pared and cored apples through a fruit press; measure them 
and add to the cider. Cook slowly, stirring frequently, and when 
the butter begins to thicken sweeten to taste with brown sugar. 
Continue cooking until of the consistency of soft jam; pack while 
hot in sterilized jars or glasses and keep in a cool place 

PEACH BUTTER 
4 pounds peaches 2 pounds sugar 

Select ripe peaches and peel and stone them before weighing. 
Cut them in pieces and put them through a fruit press. Put 
over the fire in a porcelain kettle and cook slowly until of the 
consistency of marmalade, stirring occasionally to prevent stick- 
ing. Add the sugar; stir until dissolved; cook rapidly for fifteen 
minutes, then place the kettle on the back part of the stove and 
keep warm until the butter is of the desired consistency. Pack 
in jars or tumblers. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI 

Preserve the various fruits as they come in season, following 
the recipe for Preserved Strawberries on page 372, and sealing in 
separate jars. When the desired number of fruits have been 
preserved, empty all into the preserving kettle; mix well; bring 
to a boil and when cool put into glass jars or tumblers. Pineapple, 
cherries, peaches, apricots, white grapes and the berries are the 
best fruits to use. 

JELLY-MAKING 

To be successful in jelly-making it is necessary to understand 
a few of the simple underlying principles. The making of jelly 
is possible through the presence in the fruit of pectin, a carbo- 
hydrate, somewhat similar in its properties to starch. This 
element exists in largest quantities in the following fruits: cur- 
rant, apple, quince, grape, blackberry and raspberry; so that 
these fruits are preferred for jelly-making. Moreover, the pec- 

334 u-i. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 



tin is at its best when the fruit is just ripe or a little under-ripe. 
Last, it must be remembered that if the juice ferments or if the 
cooking of the jelly is continued too long, the pectin undergoes a 
change and loses its power of gelatinizing. 

After insuring the presence of the pectin, the matter of next 
importance is to add the right quantity of sugar. The rule is to 
measure the juice and add an equal amount of sugar; but the 
rule must be followed with discretion. If the fruit contains an 
unusual percentage of sugar, less sugar should be added; if it 
is less sweet than usual, more should be added to make up the 
deficiency. The sugar will dissolve more quickly if first heated 
in a moderate oven, and will then in no way interfere with the 
cooking. 

Jelly should be put into glasses that have been thoroughly 
sterilized and covered according to the directions given under 
"Preserving Fruit." It should, however, stand twenty-four hours 
before being covered. If possible lay a sheet of glass over the 
tumblers and stand them in a sunny window. 

APPLE JELLY 

Wash the apples; remove stem and blossom ends and cut into 
quarters. Put them in a preserving kettle, adding enough cold 
water to come nearly to the top of the apples. Cover and cook 
gently until the apples are soft and clear. Mash the apples and 
drain them through a sieve in which two thicknesses of cheese- 
cloth have been laid or through a jelly bag. Avoid squeezing the 
bag or the jelly will be clouded. Boil twenty minutes and add 
the heated sugar, allowing two cups or one pound to every pint 
of juice. Boil five minutes; skim, and test by putting a teaspoon 
of juice in a cool saucer. If it jellies at once, remove from the 
fire and pour into sterilized glasses. 

QUINCE JELLY 

Follow the recipe for Apple Jelly, using part apples if desired, 
and saving the better parts of the fruit for canning.

CURRANT JELLY 

Wash and pick the currants, but do not remove the stems. 
Put them in the preserving kettle, crushing a few in the bottom 
first; heat slowly, stirring frequently. When the currants are 
hot, mash them with a potato masher and let them drip the same 
as the apples for apple jelly. After this put the cloth or bag 
over another dish and press out as much juice as possible, using 
this for a second quality of jelly. Return the clear juice to the 
kettle, adding a pint of granulated sugar to every pint of juice. 
Stir until the sugar is dissolved; place over the fire; bring to a boil; 
set aside and skim. Repeat this process three times; test by a 
few drops on a cool saucer; if it jellies remove from fire and pour 
it into sterilized glasses.

COFFEE, tea, and cocoa are stimulants affecting the circula- 
tion and nerves. Taken in moderation, they cheer and do 
not harm the healthy person if rightly prepared; but tea and coffee 
can be so treated as to draw out their caffein, theine, and tannic 
acid to such a degree as to render them exceedingly harmful. 
For persons who find their use unfavorable, there are substitutes 
on the market, made of roasted and toasted cereals. 

COFFEE 

5 tablespoons ground coffee 4 cups boiling water 
White of 1 egg (or less) 1 cup cold water 

Use an aluminum or granite-ware pot and always make the coffee 
fresh, scalding the pot each time before using. 

Wash the egg; break and beat slightly. Add half the cold 
water; mix some with the coffee; put in the pot and add the 
boiling water. Bring to the boiling point; add the remainder of 
the cold water to hasten the grounds in settling. Stand the pot 
where it will keep hot but not boil for five minutes; then serve at 
0nce, as coffee allowed to stand becomes flat and loses its aroma. 

The egg is not necessary; but most cooks use a clean shell or a 
little of the white of an egg. Others beat the whole egg with a 
little water, but use only a portion of it, keeping the rest for 
further use in a covered glass in the ice chest. 

INSTANTANEOUS COFFEE 

6 tablespoons pulverized coffee 6 cups boiling water 

A variety of pots are on the market for making instantaneous 
coffee, all containing a strainer to hold the coffee, which must be 
pulverized, not simply ground. Put the coffee in the strainer; 
scald out the pot; adjust the strainer and set the pot where the 
coffee will keep hot but not boil. Pour on freshly boiled water 
slowly, covering between additions. When filtered pour off one 
cup and let it run again through the strainer. Serve at once.

SERVING COFFEE 

Cream is usually served with coffee, but scalded milk renders 
the coffee more digestible than does cream. Fill the cup one 
fourth full of hot scalded milk; pour on the freshly-made coffee, 
adding sugar if desired. 

Whether cream or milk is used, it is better to pour the coffee on 
the cream or milk. 

After-dinner coffee should be made very strong arid served black. 

COFFEE IN BULK 

1 pound ground coffee 9 quarts water 

1 egg 

Mix the coffee with the egg that has been thinned by a little 
water, and tie it into four muslin bags. Let these soak in the 
water for three or four hours; bring to a boil and serve. 

This amount will serve fifty persons. 

TEA 

2 teaspoons tea 4 cups boiling water 

Use an earthen or china teapot and have water freshly boiled. 
Scald out the teapot; put in the tea and pour on the boiling water. 
Let stand in a warm place for five minutes ; pour off and serve. 

Never let the tea boil; never let it stand a long time on the 
leaves; and never make more by adding fresh leaves to the old. 



RUSSIAN TEA 

Make the tea as usual. Serve with thin slices of lemon from 
which the seeds have been removed. 

TEA PUNCH 

1 quart tea Juice of 6 lemons 

1 pound sugar Juice of 2 oranges 

1 lemon sliced 

Make the tea as usual; add sugar and fruit juices, cracked ice 
and more water as desired. Serve in a punch bowl with thin slices 
of lemon floating on the top.

when cool stand in the refrigerator until serving time. Have the 
glasses filled with cracked ice and have thin slices of lemon cut to 
serve with the tea. 

HOT CHOCOLATE 

2 ounces unsweetened chocolate 1 cup boiling water 

3 tablespoons sugar 3 cups bot milk 
Small piece stick cinnamon 1 teaspoon vanilla 

Scrape the chocolate very fine; add the sugar, cinnamon and 
water; stir over the fire until the mixture is smooth; then add the 
milk. Return to the fire for a minute; remove; add the vanilla; 
beat well; pour into a chocolate pot and serve plain or with 
whipped cream. 

COCOA 

4 teaspoons cocoa Little cold milk 
4 teaspoons sugar 4 cups hot milk 

Mix the cocoa and sugar, and stir together with a little cold 
milk until smooth. Stir this mixture into the hot milk; boil two 
minutes and serve. 

CHOCOLATE SYRUP 

2 cups sugar 1 cup cocoa 

2 cups water y 2 teaspoon salt 

Dissolve the sugar in one cup of water and boil five minutes. 
Mix the cocoa with the other cup of water and add to the boiling 
syrup. Boil slowly for ten minutes; add salt; cool and bottle for 
future use. 

This syrup will keep a long time in the ice chest in summer and 
may be used for making delicious drinks. 



CHOCOLATE NECTAR

FRUIT DRINKS 

The success f lemon-, orange- and pineapple-ade depends in large 
degree upon the way they are made. It is best to make a syrup as 
for sherbets, using one cup of granulated sugar to one cup of water. 
Put the sugar in cold water over the fire; stir until the sugar is 
dissolved; then cook until the syrup spins a fine thread. Take 
from the fire and add the fruit juices while the syrup is hot. If 
lemonade is desired, lemon should predominate, but orange or 
pineapple juice or both should be added to yield the best result. 
Small pieces of fresh pineapple, fresh strawberries and maraschino 
cherries added at time of serving will make the drink look pretty 
and will improve the flavor. Shaved or very finely cracked ice 
should be used. 

QUICK LEMONADE 

2 lemons 1 quart water 

4 tablespoons sugar Cracked ice 

Wash the lemons and squeeze the juice; mix thoroughly with 
the sugar, and when the sugar is dissolved add the water and ice, 
and a little fresh fruit or slices of lemon if convenient* 

EGG LEMONADE 

2 lemons 4 tablespoons sugar 

2 eggs 3 cups water 

1 cup cracked ice 

Break the eggs and beac the whites and yolks separately. Mix 
the lemons, sugar, water and ice as for lemonade; add the eggs; 
pour rapidly back and forth from one pitcher to another and serve 
before the froth disappears. 

GRAPE JUICE 

10 pounds grapes 2 pounds sugar 

1 quart water 

Wash and stem the grapes; put them in a preserving kettle and 
crush slightly. Bring to a boil and cook gently for half an hour. 
Strain though cheesecloth or jelly bag, pressing out all the juice 
possible; return to the fire with the sugar; cook for fifteen minutes; 
strain again; reheat and pour into sterilized bottles, thoroughly 
heated. Put in sterilized corks and dip the neck of the bottle in 
hot sealing wax,

OTHER FRUIT JUICES 

Raspberry, blackberry and strawberry juice may be made by 
following the recipe for grape juice but doubling the quantity of 
sugar. For currant juice use four times as much sugar as for grape 
juice. 

FRUIT SYRUPS 

Fruit syrups may be made like fruit juices, only using more 
sugar at least half as much sugar as fruit juice. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR 

4 quarts raspberries 1 quart vinegar 

Sugar 

Put two quarts of raspberries in a bowl and cover them with the 
vinegar; cover and stand in a cool place for two days. Mash the 
berries; strain the vinegar through cheesecloth; pour it over two 
quarts of fresh raspberries; let stand for another two days; strain 
and put in a preserving kettle with sugar, allowing a pound of 
sugar to a pint of juice. Heat slowly, skimming when the vinegar 
begins to boil. Boil twenty minutes and put in sterilized bottles. 
Serve as a drink, using two tablespoons to a glass of water.

^ j^HE proper feeding of an invalid plays an inestimable part in 
A his recovery. The general rules to remember are: Give 
only food that is easily digested, served as temptingly as possible. 
When the temperature is high, water and liquid food should be 
given freely to repair the rapid waste caused by fever. As the 
fever abates, semi-solid foods may be used: and as convalescence 
advances, soft foods such as eggs, toast, and simple puddings.

FIRELESS COOKERY 

time saver, fuel saver, and nutriment saver, the fireless 
cooker has proved itself to be one of the most useful of cook- 
ing devices, well worthy of the serious attention of the conserva- 
tive housekeeper. The construction of the device is simple, 
being the same in principle as the thermos bottle. The outside 
box is lined with non-conducting materials, such as mineral wool 
and asbestos, with inside compartments or wells to hold the food 
containers. When the heated vessel is tightly enclosed, the heat 
is retained and continues the process of cooking. Usually the 
cooker is equipped with radiator disks of metal or stone, which, 
when fully heated on the stove and placed in the compartment 
with the food container, materially increase the rapidity of cook- 
ing. Many dishes may be cooked without the use of radiators; 
but no cooker is complete without them, since their intense heat 
makes possible the baking of bread, cakes, and pies, the roasting 
and stewing of meats, and in fact, the cooking of almost any dish 
that can be prepared on the modern cooking range. 

Not only does the fireless cooker mean a tremendous saving of 
fuel, and of energy on the, part of the housewife, but it produces 
better results with many dishes than are possible with coal or gas. 
Cereals, for instance, which require long heating and which it is 
almost impossible to cook properly on a gas stove, are delicious 
when prepared by the fireless method. The slow, even heat cooks 
beans, rice, macaroni, and similar dishes more thoroughly, and 
improves their digestibility and flavor. Meats retain all their 
nutriment and, being cooked in their own juices, are more savory. 
The recipes given in this chapter are arranged for the cooker 
with radiators; but all of them, with the exception of those for 
roasting and baking, can be used for any cooker. Where there 

363 L-L 



FIRELESS COOKERY Fa "X n rf 

are no radiators, and where you are cooking things which require 
a great length of time, it is a good plan to remove the container 
from the cooker when the time is half gone and reheat it over the 
fire. In doing so, as in preparing the dish for the cooker in the 
first place, the container must not be uncovered before returning 
it to the cooker, or steam will escape and the food cool. 

In considering labor-saving and fuel-saving devices, the steam 
pressure cooker should be mentioned. While it requires fire for 
operation, the intense heat caused by steam under pressure so 
reduces the length of time required for cooking that there is great 
saving of fuel, and cheaper cuts of meat, dried beans and peas, 
and other foods which usually need long, slow cooking are much 
more quickly and thoroughly done. 

Among the many inventions since the days of open-fireplace 
cookery the automatic electric oven cooker, which of itself turns 
the power off upon attaining a certain registered temperature, is a 
most desirable acquisition where electricity is not too costly for 
its operation. Aladdin and his lamp were not more wonderful! 

CEREALS 

To cook cereals in the cooker to best advantage there should be 
a double-boiler receptacle. Fill the large outer pail with water 
and bring it to a boil. In the upper vessel put the required amount 
of water; stir in the cereal; season to taste; heat and stir slowly 
until it begins to thicken about ten minutes. Place the smaller 
kettle inside the larger and set away in the cooker; leave over- 
night and in the morning beat up well and reheat. If the grains 
are desired separate, cook a less time and do not beat. 

ARROWROOT GRUEL

SOUP 

The real value of soup is brought out in a fireless cooker. Meats 
and bones for soup cost but little and the real expense of the dish 
the long cooking over a fire, is done away with. The foundation

used, and the true flavor and the nutriment of these things are 
best preserved by the fireless method of cooking.

Put in baking dish a layer of fish, then a layer of sauce, until full. 
Cover top with bread crumbs and bake in the cooker for one hour. 
Use two radiators. 

MEATS 

The more expensive meats are not necessarily the most nutri- 
tious. If the housewife thoroughly understands the right way to 
prepare cheaper meats, and has a fireless cooker, it is possible to 
have a tender and juicy piece of meat at comparatively small cost. 
Meats cooked by the fireless method do not lose in weight, be- 
cause nothing escapes, and there is no shrinkage from evaporation. 
It is a recognized fact that the tough meats can be reduced to 
delicious tenderness if steamed in a closed roaster for several 
hours. This is the principle of the fireless cooker. 

CORNED BEEF 

For cold corned beef the plate piece is best, while for hot the 
brisket is to be preferred. Always have a good layer of fat around 
it. Place in cold water and bring slowly to a boil and boil for 
thirty minutes, skimming well the first few minutes. Have cover 
tightly closed before removing to the cooker, and leave six or 
eight hours, using one radiator. Cool in stock; press between 
plates, and serve in thin slices. 

BOILED BEEF 

The brisket or piece of round is good for boiling. Place the suet 
and trimming of the meat in the kettle and fry out the fat. Then 
throw in the meat and sear quickly on all sides. Remove the 
cracklings from the fat and cover the meat with boiling water.

and another layer of crumbs, until the dish is full. Pour over all 
any left-over gravy or stock to moisten. Bake in the cooker for 
one hour. 

ROAST BEEF 

The best shaped roast to cook in the fireless is a rolled roast of 
five to eight pounds. Use whatever seasoning you are accustomed 
to and prepare in the usual way for the oven. Put the roast in 
the largest vessel, and if the roast is large, raise the temperature 
of the two radiators to the highest possible point; then place the 
vessel in the large compartment and allow it to remain on the 
program of twenty minutes for each pound of roast, or three 
minutes less per pound if the roast is desired rare. 

ROUND STEAK ON BISCUITS 

Cut round steak into small half-inch squares; cover with water 
and boil for five minutes. Remove at once to the fireless cooker

CHICKEN PIE 

Place hot fricassee chicken and gravy in a baking dish. Make 
a rich crust and place on top of chicken. Place in cooker for one 
half hour. Use two radiators. 



ROAST CHICKEN 

The time necessary for roasting a chicken depends on the age of 
the bird. One hour and a half is sufficient for a young chicken, 
but an older one should be roasted two hours, and a very tough 
chicken three hours. If this course is followed, old chickens will 
turn out as tender and savory as spring chickens. Prepare the 
chicken in the usual method for the oven. It will not be necessary 
to heat the chicken to brown it before it has been placed in the 
cooker, for if both radiators have been made very hot the chicken 
when roasted will be nicely browned. It is not necessary to open 
the cooker for basting as the hot steam prevents burning. 

CHICKEN STEW 

Clean the chicken and cut it into small pieces. Heat the kettle 
and cover with water; allow to boil slowly for thirty minutes; 
season with pepper and salt, and place in cooker for six hours.

VEGETABLES 

Many vegetables are cooked best in a fireless cooker, because 
the food value and taste are developed. For those vegetables 
that are cooked or boiled in water, the usual recipes can be applied. 
It is only necessary to put sufficient boiling water over the vege- 
tables before placing in the cooker. One radiator is used. In 
baking such vegetables as potatoes, apples, etc., both radiators 
are used. Ordinary sized potatoes require from three quarters to 
one hour cooking time. 

Vegetables may be cooked by all of the following three methods, 
and each housewife should determine to her own satisfaction which 
method gives the best results : 

1. Vegetable first brought to boiling point and placed in cooker 
without radiator. 

2. Vegetable first brought to boil and placed in the cooker with 
heated radiator. 

3. Vegetable placed in cooker cold and raw with heated radiator. 
All good cooks are aware that some kinds of vegetables are better 

when cooked at a boil, such as potatoes and other vegetables con- 
taining a large percentage of starch; while other vegetables, such 
as parsnips, carrots and turnips, containing but little starch, are 
hardened by high heat and should be cooked slowly. Again, 
green peas and asparagus, containing much sugar, are better 
cooked without violent boiling. In general, any foods requiring 
long, slow cooking, are made delicious by the use of the fireless. 

It is well to remember that the fireless cooker, like other labor- 
saving devices, will yield its best results only to experiment and 
experience. Occasionally, a beginner will become discouraged by 
one or two failures and be tempted to abandon its use. Its 
mastery is not difficult and, when mastered, it can readily be 
made to cook practically anything desired, at a considerable saving 
of labor and expense,

crumbs on the top with bits of butter. Bake slowly for an hour. 

BREAD AND BISCUITS 

In baking bread or biscuits the fireless cooker is a pronounced 
success, as it browns the crusts and bakes thoroughly without 
burning. The cooker is also an excellent place to set the sponge 
to rise, for the temperature is always the same, and no matter 
what condition the kitchen may be in over night, the sponge will 
be kept perfectly warm. 

Use two radiators -for baking bread, biscuits, cakes and pies, 
placing one radiator below bread or pastry rack and one above, 
and have only one pan of bread, cake or pie in the rack at a time. 
After the pastry has been cooking ten or fifteen minutes, if the 
cooker is not provided with a steam outlet, open and close the top 
quickly to let the steam escape. Do not open again until the full 
cooking time has elapsed. Opening the cooker and letting out 
the steam prevents the bread and pastry from becoming soggy 
and permits it to brown. The regular recipes can be used, but 
several are here given. A few experiments will enable one to 
make a satisfactory time schedule.

CAKE 

Any kind of cake can be baked in the fireless cooker; but dif- 
ferent cakes require different heats, which can only be learned by 
experience. For instance : a batter with butter in it requires more 
heat than a light batter without butter. One must consider this 
fact in heating the radiators and in keeping the cake in the cooker. 
Use ordinary cake pans, placing same in bread and pastry rack 
which is furnished, using two radiators. It is a good plan after 
the cake has been in the cooker ten or fifteen minutes to open the 
top quickly and let the steam escape, if no steam outlet is pro- 
vided. Below are a few recipes that have been well tried out on 
the fireless cooker.

CHAFING-DISH COOKERY 

WHEN the fryingpan, in the form of the chafing dish, first 
entered society it was regarded'as a fashionable fad with 
which to entertain guests. It has long since proved its worth by 
introducing many a novice to the gentle art of cooking. 

Where one is fortunate enough to have an electrically equipped 
home, the management of the chafing dish becomes child's play, 
an adventure in fairyland. Where alcohol is the fuel, a few prac- 
tical suggestions may be worth while: Be sure that the lamp is 
filled and in working order. Place the equipment on a tray to 
protect the table from the heat. Have all ingredients ready before 
beginning to cook. When the dish requires steaming, use the hot- 
water pan to prevent burning. To cook food quickly, or to cook 
it brown, use only the blazer, properly heated.

CASSEROLE COOKERY 

French, more than any other nation, know the value of 
"smothered cooking," for such is cooking en casserole. This 
process develops the flavor of the many foods which are neces- 
sarily better if cooked by long, slow heat; and renders cheaper 
foods more palatable than many expensive ones. For this reason 
it would be worth the while of the American housekeeper to study 
the casserole method. Then, if she is thrifty, she will serve 
instead of expensive sirloin steak, rump steak en casserole at much 
less cost. Instead of roasting she will buy stewing meats at about 
half the price; instead of an untempting hash she will have some 
dainty, tasty viand (made from left-overs) in ramekins. And 
her family will in no wise suffer by her economy. 

Casserole dishes, either of earthenware or of tempered glass- 
ware, are always pleasing, their quaint artistic shapes making 
even a very common article of food look interesting and attractive. 
All casserole and ramekin foods are served in the dishes in which 
they are cooked; so there is no loss of heat in transference. The 
ramekins, or little individual fire-proof baking dishes, should rest 
upon paper or linen doilies.

Before attempting to make menus, a study of Balanced Rations would be helpful. Each class of food 
should be represented in a day's meals. Hearty desserts should not follow meals containing rich dishes.

BRILLAT SAVARIN: Physiology of Taste.

BALANCED RATIONS 

THE word "rations" may be defined as a daily food allowance. 
If meals formed from such rations contain the food nutrients 
proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and mineral matters in the 
proper proportions, they are balanced meals, and the rations are 
balanced rations. Such rations and such meals would fully supply 
the body's needs for energy, growth, and repair. 

On the other hand, meals containing only one class of food 
nutrients would not be balanced. For instance, a diet of starch 
foods, as bread, cereals and potatoes, or a diet of protein foods, as 
meat, beans and cheese, would quickly impair health and efficiency, 
unless balanced by the addition of foods from other classes. Evi- 
dently, then, the housewife should know the different kinds of 
foods depended on by the body for its various needs, and how 
those needs can be met with the food materials at her command. 
With such knowledge, she can plan daily menus intelligently and 
maintain her family in health. 

In a previous chapter the human body was compared to an 
engine, because, like the engine, it burns fuel which yields heat 
and energy, from which in turn it derives its ability to perform 
work. Here the comparison ends, because the body uses food 
not only to develop energy, but also to build and repair its own 
structure. 

For this twofold purpose, nature has provided an abundant 
variety of food materials. All these foods, when burned in the 
body, yield heat and energy, and nearly all build up muscular 
tissue which is used in body-building. The foods which are highest 
in body-building and repair value, as meats, eggs, or meat sub- 
stitutes, are grouped as protein foods, and the foods which are 
highest in fuel value, as fat, starch, and sugar foods, are called 

417 L-L 



BALANCED RATIONS 



carbohydrates. Still another class of foods, chiefly vegetables and 
fruits, provide bulk and mineral matters. 

Calories. The manner in which scientists measure the fuel 
value that is, the amount of heat and energy given off by a certain 
food when burned in the body is interesting. Heat can be meas- 
ured only by a change of temperature, not by weight or length. 
The heat measure cannot be a pound or a yard; it must be a definite 
quantity of heat. If a pint of water (or a pound, which is the same 
thing) is raised four degrees in temperature, say from 40 degrees to 
44 degrees, or 70 degrees to 74 degrees, a certain amount of heat is 
required. This amount of heat is called a calorie; therefore a 
calorie is simply the amount of heat or energy given off by the 
body in burning up a certain amount of food. 

If one ounce of protein, the fibrin of lean meat, for example, is 
burned in the body, it will yield a little more than 113 calories of 
heat. That is, one ounce of protein will give off a little more than 
113 times the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 
a pint of water four degrees. A pound of protein would equal 
1820 calories of energy. 

If one ounce of pure sugar is burned in the body, it will yield a 
little more than 113 calories. One pound of sugar will supply 
1820 calories. 

If one ounce of fat is burned in the body, the result will be about 
255 calories; and one pound of fat will yield 4040 calories. 

It will be noted at a glance that the heat value of fat is more 
than double the heat value of lean meat or sugar, a fact that is 
proved by daily experience. 

Scientists have shown that a man who does average muscular 
work, a carpenter for instance, requires food sufficient, when 
burned in his body, to yield about 3400 calories of energy daily to 
enable him to do his work. Now, seven-eighths of a pound of fat, 
or two pounds of sugar, or two pounds of lean meat would provide 
approximately the number of calories required; but it is very 
evident that either the fat or the sugar would be a very poor ration, 
for the reason that both foods are practically pure fuel, and would 

418 il-L 



BALANCED RATIONS 



leave nothing for bulk or repair. Work, and even life itself, on 
such a ration for any length of time would be almost impossible. 
The lean meat ration would be little better. If, on the other hand, 
this same amount of energy were derived from a variety of food 
materials which provide for restoring broken down tissues as well 
as for energy, the day's work could be performed with ease and 
efficiency. 

Fortunately, nature does not require a scientific knowledge of 
calories for normal good health; neither does she require that each 
person consume an exact number in the day's ration, and no more. 
She is far kinder and more liberal than that. She has provided us 
with an abundance of foods for body-building, for fuel and energy, 
for bulk, and for necessary mineral matters. These foods have 
been carefully studied by scientists and grouped as to their various 
uses and properties. 

What the intelligent cook chiefly needs is a familiarity with these 
food groups, and a knowledge of what the particular foods of each 
group may be depended upon to do in the body. She can then 
plan the family meals so that they will contain the proper amount 
of material from each group necessary for good health and effi- 
ciency. The human body is so adaptable that it is not necessary 
that each meal should be balanced with scientific accuracy, even if 
that were possible. If on the whole, from day to day and week to 
week, the various elements are provided for and eaten, the meals 
will be sufficiently balanced, 

FOOD GROUPS AND THEIR USES 

GROUP 1. Foods depended on for protein; that is, foods in which 
the principal parts of the nutrient is in form of protein: milk, 
skim milk, cheese, eggs, meat, poultry, fish, dried peas, beans, 
lentils, and some of the nuts. Especially useful for repair 
and body -building material. 

GROUP 2. Foods depended on for fat; that is, foods in which the 
principal part of the nutrient is in the form of fat: butter, 
cream, lard, suet, and other cooking fats, salt pork, bacon, 
table and salad oils. All have a very high fuel value. 

419 L-L 



BALANCED RATIONS 



GROUP 3. Foods depended on for starch; that is, carbohydrate 
foods in which the principal part of the nutrient is in the form 
of starch: the cereals wheat, corn, oats, rice, rye, barley 
and their products, breakfast foods, bread, crackers, maca- 
roni, cakes, cookies, puddings; also potatoes and other starchy 
vegetables. Used as fuel, and in excess, stored in the body 
as fat. 

GROUP 4. Foods depended on for sugar; that is, carbohydrate 
foods in which the principal nutrient is sugar: sugar, molasses, 
syrups, honey, candies, fruits, sweet cakes, and desserts. A 
form of fuel which is quickly utilized in the body. 

GROUP 5. Foods depended on for mineral matters; that is, foods 
not rich in nutrients but which supply iron, vitamins, vege- 
table acids, cellulose, and other body-regulating substances: 
fruits and vegetables, apples, pears, oranges, lemons, bananas, 
berries, melons, salads, lettuce, spinach, potatoes and root 
vegetables, green peas and beans, tomatoes, squash, etc, 

Vitamins. In addition to a familiarity with the various food 
groups, the good cook should know something about vitamins. 
By vitamins is understood certain life-giving substances whose 
presence in the body is essential to normal growth and health. If 
omitted from the diet for any great length of time, the so-called 
" deficiency diseases" arising from malnutrition are likely to 
develop. 

Vitamins are present in some foods, but absent in others. It is 
therefore of the utmost importance to know which foods contain 
these life-giving elements, so that they may be included in the 
daily diet. Some of them are soluble in fat, others are soluble 
in water. 

Whole milk and butter are especially rich in the fat-soluble vita- 
min, recognized by scientists as vitamin A. For this reason milk 
and butter are absolutely essential to the growth and health of 
children. Skimping on milk and milk products is certain to retard 
the child's development and expose it to the many evils which 
follow malnutrition. Codliver oil is another source, being more 
than two hundred times as rich in the valuable vitamin A as butter. 
This vitamin is also present in the yolks of eggs, in animal fats, in 

420 Ir-L 



BALANCED RATIONS 



green-leaf vegetables, such as young cabbage, and in most yellow 
vegetables, such as carrots. 

The water-soluble vitamin, known to scientists as vitamin B, is 
present in most foods, especially in fruits, vegetables and whole 
grain cereal products. It is absent in foods which have been 
"purified," such as white flour, cornstarch, polished rice, refined 
sugar, and most table oils, all of which in their natural state con- 
tain vitamins. Vitamin B supplies the nervous reserve so neces- 
sary to combat neuritis. 

Another water-soluble vitamin is recognized by scientists as 
vitamin C. This is found abundantly in all citrus-fruit juices, in 
lemons, oranges, grape-fruit, and in green vegetables. Tomatoes 
and white potatoes are a valuable source of vitamin C. Vitamin 
C is the accepted preventive and cure for scurvy. 

Since an abundant supply of vitamins exists in all fresh vege- 
table foods, in milk and in meat from animals fed on fresh foods, 
the normal adult living on a well-balanced diet is certain to obtain 
a plentiful supply. But the diet of growing children must be 
watched carefully to see that they get a proper proportion. For- 
tunately, vitamins A, B, and C are all found in whole milk. Chil- 
dren suffering from rickets and other diseases of under-nourish- 
ment have frequently been cured by a liberal diet of foods that con- 
tain vitamin A. 

It should be remembered that all the vitamins are easily de- 
stroyed by excessive cooking or sterilization. Fresh foods, and 
those that have been properly cooked, contain the helpful element 
in greatest measure. While canned foods and other dried vege- 
tables and fruits may be necessary for economy and convenience, 
or to give bulk to the diet, they should never be used to the exclu- 
sion of green-leaf vegetables and fruits.

powder has been sifted; then the nut-meats and, last, the well- 
whipped whites. Bake in layers or in round cake dish. Remove 
and ice with caramel icing and nut-meats. Bake with two radi- 
ators. 

DRIED FRUITS 

Dried fruits are especially satisfactory when prepared in the 
fireless cooker; for they can be cooked the long time that is neces- 
sary to their perfection, without danger of being broken or re- 
duced to a mush. 

APPLES 

Wash the apples in cold water, soak over night and cook in the 
water in which they were soaked. Boil slowly for ten minutes, 
adding sugar, lemon and spices to taste. Place in cooker for six 
hours. 

APRICOTS 

Wash the fruit carefully and allow it to soak in cold water over 
night. Boil slowly for ten minutes in same water; add sugar to 
taste and place in cooker for four hours. 



BLACK FIGS 

Wash figs and soak over night in cold water. Boil slowly for 
five minutes in same water in which they were soaked; add sugar 
to taste; cook until sugar is dissolved; place in cooker for three 
or four hours. Serve cold with cream. 



FIGS 

Cut stems from figs ; cover with cold water; add a slice of lemon 
and simmer for five minutes. Add sugar to taste and cook five 
minutes longer. Place in cooker for three hours. 



DRIED PEACHES 

Wash peaches in cold water; drain and cover with fresh water; 
allow to soak over night. Boil slowly for ten minutes in water in 
which they were soaked; add sugar to taste and place in cooker 
for four hours.

FIRELESS COOKERY 



DRIED PEARS 

Cook pears the same as peaches. A few whole cloves, a small 
piece of cinnamon and a slice of lemon added while pears are boil- 
ing will improve their flavor. 

PRUNES 

Wash the prunes in cold water; cover with fresh water and 
allow to soak over night. Simmer for five minutes in the same 
water in which they were soaked; add sugar to taste and when 
sugar is dissolved and tho prunes boiling hot, place in the cooker 
for four hours. 

BREAD PUDDING

No. 3. U. S. Department of Agriculture chart showing bread and other cereal 
foods which supply together about 240 one-hundred-calorie portions, or 24,000

cereals would furnish about the same amount of body fuel. This proportion may 
be raised or lowered by half. See note, page 431.

How TO ESTIMATE THE FOOD VALUE OF CEREAL FOODS 

Dry cereals average about 16 one-hundred-calorie portions per pound. Bread 
and rolls average about 12 one-hundred-calorie portions per pound. At a rough 
estimate, three-fourths of the weight of bread and rolls is flour. Three-fourths 
of the ten pounds above is 7^ pounds, which, added to the 7^ pounds of cereals, 
equals 15 pounds of dry cereals food. 15 X 16 equals 240 one-hundred-ealorie 
portions, or 24,000 calories, which is the required amount. Or,

No. 5. U. S. Department of Agriculture chart showing vegetables and fruits 
fresh, canned, and dried, which together supply about 160 one-hundred-caloric 
portions, or 16,000 calories. Any other combination of ordinary vegetables and 
fruits equivalent to 70 pounds of fresh material would supply about the same 
amount of body fuel. If more bulk is needed in the diet, it is better to supply it 
from vegetables and fruits than from the richer foods. 

The separate items are: 

Fresh Vegetables and Fruits: White potatoes (% peck), 7 pounds; sweet 
potatoes (^2 peck), 7 pounds; asparagus, 2 pounds; beets, with greens, 2 pounds; 
carrots, 2 pounds; cabbage, 2 pounds; squash, 2 pounds; turnips, 2 pounds;

2 pounds; cherries (1 quart), 2 pounds; peaches (1 quart), 2 pounds; total, 8 
pounds. 

Dried Vegetables and Fruits: Lima beans, 2 pounds; raisins, 1 pound; total, 

3 pounds. 

How TO ESTIMATE THE FUEL VALUE OF VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

Fresh and canned vegetables and fruits as used in most households average about 

225 calories, or 2)^ one-hundred-calorie portions, per pound; canned foods such as 

peas, string beans, cherries, and peaches, having about the same fuel value as if 

they were fresh weight. Dried vegetables and fruits have about six times the fuel

value of these foods fresh weight, or about 1350 calories 13^ one-hundred-calorie 
portions per pound. Counting the 3 pounds dried vegetables and fruits as 18 
pounds fresh weight, the above items would total 70 pounds fresh weight. 
Therefore, 2| X 70 pounds fresh weight would equal 157 one-hundred-calorie 
portions; or 

100-Calorie 
Portions 

2M X 52 pounds fresh and canned weight = 117 

X 3 pounds dried weight = 



This would equal 15,750 calories, or a little less than the required estimate. 

The larger the proportion of fresh vegetables and fruits to those canned and 
dried thejbetter. 

From the foregoing it is clear that if the weekly food supply 
is satisfactory, the exact make-up of each meal is not important. 
It is well to do a certain amount of balancing from day to day, 
although the habit of providing all the required kinds of foods 
regularly will save unnecessary time and thought in this direction. 
If the housekeeper will keep a record of the foods used during the 
week, she will have little difficulty in securing a satisfactory result. 
An account book, or a set of cards, should be kept for this purpose, 
showing the date, the kinds of food, with weight, measure, and 
cost, listed under their proper headings: Milk, Meat, Eggs, and 
Similar Protein Foods; Fat Foods; Cereal Foods; Sugar and 
Sweets; Vegetables and Fruits. With these facts in hand, the 
fuel value can be roughly estimated by weight, or in calories, by 
means of the table on the following page. For the fuel value of 
any particular food per pound, see the tables on pages 433, 434, 



RULES FOR BALANCING DIET OF YOUR OWN FAMILY 

1. Determine from Table of Energy Needs, page 425, the 
approximate number of hundred-calorie portions needed by your 
family per week. 

2. Keep account of foods purchased each week under the proper 
heads. 

3. Estimate the fuel value of each group. 

4. Provide 20 per cent, or about % of the total fuel required, 
from milk, meat, and similar foods; 20 per cent, or about ^o> from 

430 L-L 



BALANCED RATIONS 



fat foods; 30 per cent, or about T 3 ^, from cereal foods; 10 per 
cent, or about T V, from sugar foods; 20 per cent, or about ^, from 
fruits and vegetables. If you do this from week to week, your 
family rations will be sufficiently balanced. In a short time the 
habit of providing in the right proportions will become established.

These amounts of food may be depended on to furnish an attractive diet for an 
average family for a week. When economy is necessary, it is often possible to 
effect considerable saving without loss of fuel value. By means of the tables on 
pages 433, 434, and from the market price of foods, the cost of the fuel value of 
different foods can be compared, and the less expensive selected. It is also possible, 
to a certain extent, to raise or lower the proportions of the different groups with 
safety. For example, cereal foods will often provide fuel at less cost than the 
protein and fat foods; but an extra allowance of cereal foods should never be at 
the expense of milk or green-leaf vegetables.

DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 

FROM the nature of their diet, it is easy to believe that Jack 
Sprat of the nursery rhyme was under weight, and that Mrs . 
Sprat was the exact opposite. While it is undoubtedly true that 
some persons are naturally inclined to thinness, and others to fat- 
ness, it is also equally true that undue excess in either direction can 
largely be controlled by proper diet. 

Causes of Overweight- Simply stated, excess weight results from 
an overconsumption of the fuel and energy foods; that is, starches, 
sugars, and fats. If too much of these foods is consumed, the 
excess is stored up by nature in the body as adipose tissue or fat. 
Nature's wise purpose is to be able, in emergency, to draw upon 
the stored supply, when the tissues are wasted by disease or fever. 
But an excess of such storage results not only in an awkward 
burden of avoirdupois, and unpleasing physical proportions, but 
causes overtaxation of the heart, and becomes dangerous to health. 

Curing One's Self. The cause being understood, the method of 
cure is evident. The first necessity is to face the fact. Be weighed. 
'Consult the table of normal weights, page 441, then use every 
ounce of will-power possessed to overcome the unpleasant condi- 
tion. Unless the overweight is due to some disturbance of the 
secretions of the body, about which a physician should be con- 
sulted, unflagging perseverance in cutting down the diet, and in 
taking exercise will result in reducing the pull on the scales. 

Foods to Avoid. Of course the foods to shun are the starch, 
sugar, and fat foods, 

A LIST OF FOODS TO AVOID 

Appetizers catsups, pickles, olives, horseradish, etc. 
Rich foods made with fat or oil bases cream soups and sauces, 
oil salad dressings. 

29 437 *-i. 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 

Carbonaceous meats pork and pork products; sausage, scrap- 
ple, etc. Such vegetables and cereals as potatoes, hominy, rice, 
cornmeal mush, oatmeal, parsnips, beets, turnips, and other 
starchy foods. 

Sweets candies, cakes, puddings, pastry. 

Beverages tea and coffee may be used, but with a minimum 
of sugar and cream, far better without either. Avoid cocoa and 
unskimmed milk. 

WHAT TO EAT 
For breakfasts: 

Fruits oranges, grapefruit, peaches, pears, apples, grapes, cherries, etc. 

Berries fresh strawberries, blackberries, huckleberries or blueberries, etc. 

Bread or cereal one piece toast, bran, or graham bread; or, 1 cup (scant) puffed 

whole cereal, with skimmed milk. 
Beverages tea or coffee without cream and sugar. 

For dinners : 



Clear soups or broths. 

Lean meat, chicken, or white fleshed fish. 

Green and succulent vegetables spinach, cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, string 

beans, cress, celery, etc., without butter or cream dressing. 
Salads with a very little French dressing. 
Fruit desserts; as, prunes, pineapple. 
Beverages lemonade with little sugar, or tea or coffee. 

For luncheons or suppers: 

Thin soup; as, tomato, consomme. 

One glass skimmed milk or buttermilk, or poached egg, or spinach with egg, or fish. 

Bread or cereal as for breakfast. 

Fruit or plain salad. 

Select only one or two items of food for each meal; a greater 
variety is conducive to weight. 

In following a reducing dietary, it would be well to serve a sugar- 
less, creamless, cup of hot tea or coffee mid-meals, but no food 
should be eaten between meals. It is generally thought wise to cut 
down the quantity of water, but it should be remembered that in 
cases of gout and rheumatism, an increased amount of liquid is 
necessary. In all cases gradual reduction of weight is much better 

438 L-L 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 



than rapid decrease. Loose skin over reduced muscles makes an 
aged appearance, and sudden loss of weight may injure the health. 
Elderly people should not follow a rigid system of reduction. 

If a glass or two of water is taken before eating, it may help 
with a rigid regime, by giving a sense of fullness at the beginning 
of a meal. The extent of diet restrictions depends upon the amount 
of excess weight. Having decided how much the daily allowance 
should be cut down, do not carry out the plan spasmodically, but 
day -in and day-out keep within the limitation; and the reward will 
surely come. 

It is well to remember that over-eating is more dangerous than 
under-eating; and that after all, the question of reduction is chiefly 
n question of the intelligent control of the appetite. 

By consulting chapter on Balanced Rations, page 417, many 
hints may be gleaned as to selections for menus, always allowing 
less food than for the average person. 

A bottle of citrate of magnesia taken once a week is usually 
beneficial as a body regulator, the consequent depletion of the 
blood vessels of the intestines causing them to give up considerable 
water, thus lessening weight. 

Exercise. Since overweight is caused by storage of energy food, 
it follows that an expenditure of energy will draw upon such stor- 
age, and reduce weight. Before any system of strenuous exercise 
is undertaken, a thorough examination should be given by a phy- 
sician as to heart action, blood pressure, and general physical fit- 
ness. Exercises are of very little help unless kept up regularly. 
One rule must be observed: stop when tired. Almost any good 
book on physical training will give excellent exercises for weight- 
control. 

Remember that walking in the open air is always a splendid 
exercise, using up food fuel rapidly. No so-called "reducing*' 
medicines should be taken without the advice of a physician, for 
probably all such medicines are dangerous. 

HOW TO ADD WEIGHT 

Foods to Avoid. It is very much easier to add than to reduce 
weight, for all the "indulgences" of diet are the things needed. 
Usually the person of underweight is overfond of salads and other 
foods which give bulk. It would be well to read a list of what the 
obese should avoid, in order to know what the too thin should eat; 
but if sweets and desserts are taken at the beginning of a meal, or 
between meals, the desire for substantial food is lost. 

439 L- L 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 



What to Eat. The fattening foods or carbohydrates starches, 
sugars and fats are what the too thin person should choose in 
diet; and not many succulent green vegetables, or salads, unless 
they are served with mayonnaise dressing made of oil, or of rich 
cream. Potatoes or any other starchy vegetable with cream sauce: 
or rice, hominy, corn and similar cereal foods should be selected. 

For desserts puddings and cakes with cream, ice-cream, and 
whipped cream; sweet chocolate. 

For beverages little tea or coffee. Drink and eat whole milk, 
swallowing it slowly. This food is excellent between meals. Cocoa 
and chocolate. 

If digestion is weak, do not use many different kinds of food at 
one meal. Use no pickles; few acids. 

By turning to the tables of food values on page 425, calculation 
may be made as to dietary, always allowing more fuel food than 
for the average person. 

List of Fattening Foods 

Cream soups. 

Cream dressings. 

Milk dishes. 

Oil dressings. 

Potatoes, sweet and white, turnips, carrots, etc. 

Macaroni, spaghetti, etc. 

Rice, tapioca, and arrow-root puddings. 

Cakes of all kinds. 

Sweet chocolate, candies. 

Cocoa, chocolate, whipped cream, ice-cream, cereals with cream. 

Eat also eggs, fish, meat, beans, peas, lentils, fruits and berries 
Consult the following weight tables. Be weighed; and train 
your taste to like what your body needs. To do this, take at first 
only a little of the kind of food you do not care for. Rest, and 
then exercise. Take plenty of sleep ten hours each night if 
possible, and angles will become curves; the lean and hungry look 
will disappear; and, incidentally, life will seem brighter. Then, 
too, in case of illness nature will have a store of energy fuel to 
draw upon. 

Rest-. Thin people are usually of restless, nervous temperament, 
" always on the move," expending muscular energy every waking 
minute; bolting a meal, and flying away to another occupation. 
The old Roman custom of resting and relaxing, but not napping, 

440 L-L 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 



after eating had a very commendable reason. So, too, had their 
custom of massaging with oil. The thin person will find such 
massage very beneficial, for the body is able to absorb such food. 

Codliver oil, taken either in capsules, or by the spoonful fol- 
lowed with orange juice, is a flesh-builder as well as a health giver. 
This oil is very easily digested. 

Rest is necessary for increasing weight ; but so also is exercise, for 
the thin person needs plenty of oxygen to aid in the digestion and 
assimilation of food, and in throwing off poisonous waste matters. 

The following tables afford a standard of weight for comparison. 
In comparing your own weight with the table, your type of build 
should be taken into account, as well as height and age. A person 
of naturally slender type might be below the standard, or one of 
stocky, thick-set type might be above the standard, and yet both 
be normally healthy. If, however, the excess in either direction 
is over ten per cent, corrective measures should be taken. 

In ascertaining height, measure in shoes; stand erect, and press 
measuring rod down on scalp. Weigh yourself in indoor clothing 
and shoes. Subtract one inch for height if sensible heels are worn; 
if heels are "high, " subtract two inches. Your standard of weight 
is found where your height and age columns meet,

SCHOOL LUNCHES 



The child is building the temple of the soul, planned by the divine 
Architect but ofttimes ruined by man's bad workmanship. 

Child Life. 



Upon the health and strength of our children the glory and greatness 
cf our nation depend. 

Every child has a right to be as healthy as present knowledge can 
make him. Proper feeding is one of the chief factors in health. 

Health Education. 



444 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 

THE witty French cook who said, "Tell me what you eat, 
and I will tell you what you are, " might even more certainly 
have stated, "Tell me what you give your children to eat, and I 
will tell you what they will grow to be, " for the kind of food the 
child eats largely determines whether he will be a strong, healthy 
adult, or a weakling. More important, then, than the wise 
selection of foods for grown people is the proper feeding of the 
growing bodies of children especially of little children, 

A few general rules should be borne in mind: 

1. Meals should be given at regular times. 

2. No "nibbling" between meals. If a child is really hungry, a 
slice of bread and butter will satisfy the craving for food. Never 
give candy at such times. It will not only spoil the normal appe- 
tite, but will encourage a bad habit. Oftentimes a glass of water, 
and not food, is what the little one really craves. 

3. Teach the child to drink plenty of water between meals 
several glasses a day. 

4. Happiness while eating is essential to good digestion. 

5. Do not force a child to eat. If after a day or two the appetite 
does not return, consult a physician. 

0. Teach a child to wash face and hands before eating. Explain 
that dirt is dangerous. Explain that flies are dangerous. 

Teach a child to demand fresh air and sunshine, for they are 
the great cleansers of nature. 

7. Children may generally be taught to like all kinds of foods 
that are good for them. By giving a little of a new food at first, 
taste can be cultivated. 

Staple Food Requirements 

1. Milk is the best arid most important food for growing chil- 
dren. No other food can take its place. Children over five years 
of age should have at least three cups a day, more if possible. 

445 L-L 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 



Warm milk is more easily digested than cold milk. If children 
rebel against drinking plain milk, it may be given in the form of 
cocoa, milk soups, custards, etc. If it is impossible to get fresh 
milk, use dried milk. If neither fresh nor dried milk is procurable, 
use evaporated milk. If skimmed milk is given, the child should 
eat plenty of vegetables and cream or butter. Tea and coffee 
should not be given to growing children at all. 

Bread and milk form a perfect food, containing all food elements 
in the right proportion to sustain child life. The milk furnishes 
protein for muscles and other tissues; fats and sugar for body fuel; 
minerals for bones and other tissues; vitamins, essential to growth 
and health. The bread furnishes some of each of these, but is 
valuable because it provides starch fuel food, and gives bulk. 

2. Bread, cereals and other grain products should furnish about 
one-third the food required by a child. 

3. Vegetables are essential to the growing child not only for their 
food value, but because they contain vitamins (see page 40). 
The water in which vegetables and rice have been boiled should be 
used for making soups, sauces, and gravies. Where for any reason 
there is a scarcity of milk and eggs, the diet should include as much 
milk as possible, with pea or bean soups, spinach and other green 
vegetables, oatmeal, and dried fruits. Vegetables and fruits are 
excellent sources of iron and other elements necessary for growth. 
If combined with milk, they will supply food value fully equal to 
that of meat. 

4. Eggs, meat, etc. Aside from milk, eggs are the best source of 
protein for children. Where plenty of milk and an egg a day are 
included in the diet, a child needs very little meat. Allow not 
more than 2 ounces of meat a day for a child from 7-10 years; 3 
ounces daily from 1014 years. Broth from stews may be given 
on vegetables and bread. 

5. Fruits. There should be some fruit in the diet every day. 
Where fresh fruit is not -possible, use dried fruit. Bananas should 
not be eaten raw by very young children. Bananas are not ripe 
until the skins have brown spots. They should be cooked if given 
before they reach this stage. 

6. Sweets. There is danger of children getting too much sugar 
and spoiling the appetite. They should not have more than the 
following allowance, aside from that contained in foods: 

5 to 7 years 1 tablespoon daily 

7 to 12 years 2 tablespoons daily 

446 L-L 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 



It is better to give sugar in cocoa and desserts than as candy. 
Molasses has a high food value. Dates are a good substitute for 
candy. 

7. Fats are essential for growing children. Cream and butter, 
the fats of milk, are the most important kinds; therefore, children 
should have unskimmed milk. For the delicate child, cod-liver 
oil is an excellent fat, containing large quantities of vitamins, see 
page 420. Cod-liver oil may be procured in gelatine capsules, but 
if orange juice is given after, the child seldom objects to the oil. 
Other oils, such as olive, corn, and peanut, are good foods, too, in 
small quantities. (See Salads, page 167.) Young children should 
not have cooked fats except bacon fat, which is easily digested. 
All fried foods should be avoided. 

Children need at least three meals a day. The heavy meal 
should preferably come at mid-day, with a light supper, such as 
bread and whole milk, baked potatoes, stewed fruit; or cereal and 
milk, bread and butter, baked bananas; or poached egg on toast, 
baked potatoes, bread and butter, apple sauce, gingerbread. 

Desserts. Cooked desserts are not essential with plenty of bread 
and butter and vegetables and fruit. When given, they should be 
plain and simple; as cereal puddings with fruit, such as rice, oat- 
meal, or bread pudding. 

Home Lunches. If dinner is at the end of the day, let the lunch- 
eon be as light as the supper would be if the main meal were at 
mid-day. See end of this chapter for suggestions. 

Basket Lunches. School authorities are recognizing the impor- 
tance of a warm mid-day meal for children, and many schools pro- 
vide school lunches. If a child must carry a whole luncheon, it 
should be nutritious as well as appetizing. If possible let it include 
a bottle of milk. If it is practical for the child to use a thermos 
bottle, the milk may, of course, be warm; or hot cocoa, or soup may 
be provided by this means. The following suggestions should 
prove helpful : 

NOURISHING SANDWICHES APPETIZING FILLINGS 

Whole wheat bread Peanut butter 

Raisin bread Chopped celery with mayonnaise

SCHOOL LUNCHES 



See chapter on Sandwiches, page 287, for further suggestions. 
Desserts of custard, baked apple, sweet chocolate, maple sugar, 
sponge cake, fruit cookies, or gingerbread make a pleasant variety. 

It is essential for the children to have plenty of time in which to eat 
their mid-day meal. The child who bolts a meal and rushes back 
to school cannot either work or digest properly. It would be better 
to carry a lunch than to go home fora warm meal, if the journey 
means hurried eating. 

Summary. In the diet of the child the following is suggestive: 

WHAT FOODS TO AVOID WHAT FOODS MEAN GOOD HEALTH 

Coffee Milk 

Tea Vegetables 

Sodas Thick soups 

Much candy Cereals 

Doughnuts Fruits 

Much meat Honey and mola^,-. 

Rich cakes Rice puddings 

Highly seasoned dishes Custards 

Pies Ice cream 

The School Lunch Room 

The school lunch room, which may be conducted by the Parent- 
Teacher Association or the Home and School Club, makes it possible 
for children to buy nourishing warm food for a few cents. This 
is a very pleasant arrangement for all children, but its chief value 
is in promoting the health of those who are under-nourished at 
home. The time will come, no doubt, when the authorities of 
every school will provide meals for all children who are under- 
weight, or who otherwise show malnutrition. 

Most housekeepers have collections of recipes of all kinds, but 
probably few have attempted to compile lists of dishes suitable for 
school lunches. A few suggestions may be welcome. By all means 
children should be instructed in the lunch room as to food values, 
and should not be allowed to select sweets or ice-cream in the place 
of substantial dishes. 

School Lunch Room Bills of Fare 

1. Vegetable or milk soup; crackers; rolls; fruit; plain cake; 
cocoa. 

2. Meat and vegetable stew; bread and butter; sweet chocolate.

4. Macaroni with cheese and tomato sauce; fruit; chopped date

herds's pie (meat pie with mashed potato cover) ; creamed frizzled

A LIST OF SOUPS DESSERTS 

Vegetable Soup Rice Pudding 

( ream of Pea Soup Boiled Custard 

( Voam of Tomato Soup Tapioca and Fruit Pudding 

Dried Lima Bean Soup Bread Pudding 

Split Pea Soup Apple Betty with Cream 

Potato Soup Junket 

Corn Chowder Fruit, raw or cooked 

Fish Chowder Gingerbread or plain cake 

Cocoa for School Lunch Room, x 

Measure one pound of cocoa. Add as many cups of sugar as 
there are of cocoa. Add three cups of water. Cook until thick 
and glossy. Pour into jelly glasses or glass jars. Cover and set 
away. When cocoa is wanted for lunch use, prepare according 
to the following recipe : 

1 cup milk for each child. 

11/2 tablespoons of the cocoa mixture 

Heat the milk scalding hot in a double boiler. Add the cocoa 
mixture. Beat well and serve. More sugar may be used in the 
mixture if it is found that the children desire it sweeter. 

NOTE. The tables of height and weight for girls and boys, pages 
450, 451, afford a standard for comparison only. In comparing a 
child's height and weight with the table, the type of build should 
be taken into account. A child of slender type might be under 
weight, and one of thick-set, stocky type might be over weight, 
and yet both be normally healthy. A slight variation is no cause 
for alarm, but if the difference amounts to ten per cent, however, 
corrective measures should be taken.

GOOD TO REMEMBER 

One teaspoon or tablespoon means a level teaspoon or tablespoon. 

A tin, aluminum or glass measuring cup should be used for all measuring. These 
cups are marked off in quarters and thirds and insure accuracy. 

Aluminum cooking utensils are the best for general use. They are expensive 
in the beginning, but outwear other kinds. They are light in weight and easily 
cleaned, and there ia no enamel to chip off and poison the food. 

Discolored pans and kettles, not aluminum, should be boiled in water to which 
a lump of washing soda has been added. 

Scrupulous cleanliness and eternal vigilance are the essentials of all goodcooking. 

If the oven becomes too hot while bread or cake is baking, it may be cooled by 
setting a pan of water in it. 

If bread or cake browns too quickly, cover with a piece of paper. 

Pies should always be baked in a quick oven, with the greatest heat at the bottom* 

Cakes will seldom stick if this direction is followed : Grease the pans carefully ; 
dust lightly with flour; shake out the superfluous flour and pour in the mixture. 

Muffins and gems will be lighter if baked in pans that have been thoroughly 
heated as well as greased. 

Biscuit dough should Be as soft as possible. Biscuits will bs lighter and 
crisper if not allowed to touch each other on the baking tin. 

Meat should never be put in cold water except in making soup, for cold water 
draws out the juices. Wipe with a wet cloth, or rinse and dry at once, and in cooking 
use boiling water. 

Tomatoes that are too strongly acid are improved by a pinch of baking soda. 
The soda should always be added when they are to be mixed with milk or cream, 
to prevent curdling. 

The white of eggs will whip more readily if a pinch of salt is added. The eggs 
should be as cold as possible. 

Cream that is too thin to whip may be made to do so by the addition of aa 
unbeaten white of egg. 

When dipping articles hi egg and cracker, dilute the egg with a tablespoon of 
water. Only the white may be used, if desired, but never only the yolk, as it is the 
albumen which is needed to form a coat which the grease cannot penetrate. 

Almost any dish is made more inviting by a little garnishing. Parsley, water* 
cress, slices of lemon, bfcet, onion, hard-boiled egg or maraschino cherry, small 
triangles of toast, potato balls, mashed potatoes pressed through a pastry tube 
all these are useful and within reach of almost every cook. Paper doilies, paper 
cups, and paper frills for chops may also be used to good advantage: these may tre 
tought at any stationer's*

DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 

FROM the nature of their diet, it is easy to believe that Jack 
Sprat of the nursery rhyme was under weight, and that Mrs . 
Sprat was the exact opposite. While it is undoubtedly true that 
some persons are naturally inclined to thinness, and others to fat- 
ness, it is also equally true that undue excess in either direction can 
largely be controlled by proper diet. 

Causes of Overweight.- Simply stated, excess weight results from 
an overconsumption of the fuel and energy foods; that is, starches, 
sugars, and fats. If too much of these foods is consumed, the 
excess is stored up by nature in the body as adipose tissue or fat. 
Nature's wise purpose is to be able, in emergency, to draw upon 
the stored supply, when the tissues are wasted by disease or fever. 
But an excess of such storage results not only in an awkward 
burden of avoirdupois, and unpleasing physical proportions, but 
causes overtaxation of the heart, and becomes dangerous to health. 

Curing One's Self. The cause being understood, the method of 
cure is evident. The first necessity is to face the fact. Be weighed. 
'Consult the table of normal weights, page 441, then use every 
ounce of will-power possessed to overcome the unpleasant condi- 
tion. Unless the overweight is due to some disturbance of the 
secretions of the body, about which a physician should be con- 
sulted, unflagging perseverance in cutting down the diet, and in 
taking exercise will result in reducing the pull on the scales. 

Foods to Avoid. Of course the foods to shun are the starch, 
sugar, and fat foods, 

A LIST OF FOODS TO AVOID 

Appetizers catsups, pickles, olives, horseradish, etc. 
Rich foods made with fat or oil bases cream soups and sauces, 
oil salad dressings. 

29 437 i/-fc 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 

Carbonaceous meats pork and pork products; sausage, scrap- 
ple, etc. Such vegetables and cereals as potatoes, hominy, rice, 
cornmeal mush, oatmeal, parsnips, beets, turnips, and other 
starchy foods. 

Sweets candies, cakes, puddings, pastry. 

Beverages tea and coffee may be used, but with a minimum 
of sugar and cream, far better without either. Avoid cocoa and 
unskimmed milk. 

WHAT TO EAT 
For breakfasts: 

Fruits oranges, grapefruit, peaches, pears, apples, grapes, cherries, etc. 

Berries fresh strawberries, blackberries, huckleberries or blueberries, etc. 

Bread or cereal one piece toast, bran, or graham bread; or, 1 cup (scant) puffed 

whole cereal, with skimmed milk. 
Beverages tea or coffee without cream and sugar. 

For dinners : 

Clear soups or broths. 

Lean meat, chicken, or white fleshed fish. 

Green and succulent vegetables spinach, cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, string 

beans, cress, celery, etc., without butter or cream dressing. 
Salads with a very little French dressing. 
Fruit desserts; as, prunes, pineapple. 
Beverages lemonade with little sugar, or tea or coffee. . 

For luncheons or suppers : 

Thin soup; as, tomato, consomme. 

One glass skimmed milk or buttermilk, or poached egg, or spinach with egg, or fish. 

Bread or cereal as for breakfast. 

Fruit or plain salad. 

Select only one or two items of food for each meal; a greater 
variety is conducive to weight. 

In following a reducing dietary, it would be well to serve a sugar- 
less, creamless, cup of hot tea or coffee mid-meals, but no food 
should be eaten between meals. It is generally thought wise to cut 
down the quantity of water, but it should be remembered that in 
cases of gout and rheumatism, an increased amount of liquid is 
necessary. In all cases gradual reduction of weight is much better 

438 L-L 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 



than rapid decrease. Loose skin over reduced muscles makes an 
aged appearance, and sudden loss of weight may injure the health. 
Elderly people should not follow a rigid system of reduction. 

If a glass or two of water is taken before eating, it may help 
with a rigid regime, by giving a sense of fullness at the beginning 
of a meal. The extent of diet restrictions depends upon the amount 
of excess weight. Having decided how much the daily allowance 
should be cut down, do not carry out the plan spasmodically, but 
day -in and day-out keep within the limitation; and the reward will 
surely come. 

It is well to remember that over-eating is more dangerous than 
under-eating; and that after all, the question of reduction is chiefly 
a question of the intelligent control of the appetite. 

By consulting chapter on Balanced Rations, page 417, many 
hints may be gleaned as to selections for menus, always allowing 
less food than for the average person. 

A bottle of citrate of magnesia taken once a week is usually 
beneficial as a body regulator, the consequent depletion of the 
blood vessels of the intestines causing them to give up considerable 
water, thus lessening weight. 

Exercise. Since overweight is caused by storage of energy food, 
it follows that an expenditure of energy will draw upon such stor- 
age, and reduce weight. Before any system of strenuous exercise 
is undertaken, a thorough examination should be given by a phy- 
sician as to heart action, blood pressure, and general physical fit- 
ness. Exercises are of very little help unless kept up regularly. 
One rule must be observed: stop when tired. Almost any good 
book on physical training will give excellent exercises for weight- 
control. 

Remember that walking in the open air is always a splendid 
exercise, using up food fuel rapidly. No so-called " reducing " 
medicines should be taken without the advice of a physician, for 
probably all such medicines are dangerous. 

HOW TO ADD WEIGHT 

Foods to Avoid. It is very much easier to add than to reduce 
weight, for all the "indulgences" of diet are the things needed. 
Usually the person of underweight is overfond of salads and other 
foods which give bulk. It would be well to read a list of what the 
obese should avoid, in order to know what the too thin should eat; 
but if sweets and desserts are taken at the beginning of a meal, or 
between meals, the desire for substantial food is lost. 

439 L-L 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 



What to Eat. The fattening foods or carbohydrates starches, 
sugars and fats are what the too thin person should choose in 
diet; and not many succulent green vegetables, or salads, unless 
they are served with mayonnaise dressing made of oil, or of rich 
cream. Potatoes or any other starchy vegetable with cream sauce; 
or rice, hominy, corn and similar cereal foods should be selected. 

For desserts puddings and cakes with cream, ice-cream, and 
whipped cream; sweet chocolate. 

For beverages little tea or coffee. Drink and eat whole milk, 
swallowing it slowly. This food is excellent between meals. Cocoa 
and chocolate. 

If digestion is weak, do not use many different kinds of food at 
one meal. Use no pickles; few acids. 

By turning to the tables of food values on page 425, calculation 
may be made as to dietary, always allowing more fuel food than 
for the average person. 

List of Fattening Foods 

Cream soups. 

Cream dressings. 

Milk dishes. 

Oil dressings. 

Potatoes, sweet and white, turnips, carrots, etc. 

Macaroni, spaghetti, etc. 

Rice, tapioca, and arrow-root puddings. 

Cakes of all kinds. 

Sweet chocolate, candies. 

Cocoa, chocolate, whipped cream, ice-cream, cereals with cream. 

Eat also eggs, fish, meat, beans, peas, lentils, fruits and berries 
Consult the following weight tables. Be weighed; and tram 
your taste to like what your body needs. To do this, take at first 
only a little of the kind of food you do not care for. Rest, and 
then exercise. Take plenty of sleep ten hours each night if 
possible, and angles will become curves; the lean and hungry look 
will disappear; and, incidentally, life will seem brighter. Then, 
too, in case of illness nature will have a store of energy fuel to 
draw upon. 

Rest. Thin people are usually of restless, nervous temperament, 
"always on the move," expending muscular energy every waking 
minute; bolting a meal, and flying away to another occupation. 
The old Roman custom of resting and relaxing, but not napping, 

440 L-L 



DIET FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 



after eating had a very commendable reason. So, too, had their 
custom of massaging with oil. The thin person will find such 
massage very beneficial, for the body is able to absorb such food. 

Codliver oil, taken either in capsules, or by the spoonful fol- 
lowed with orange juice, is a flesh-builder as well as a health giver. 
This oil is very easily digested. 

Rest is necessary for increasing weight ; but so also is exercise, for 
the thin person needs plenty of oxygen to aid in the digestion and 
assimilation of food, and in throwing off poisonous waste matters. 

The following tables afford a standard of weight for comparison. 
In comparing your own weight with the table, your type of build 
should be taken into account, as well as height and age. A person 
of naturally slender type might be below the standard, or one of 
stocky, thick-set type might be above the standard, and yet both 
be normally healthy. If, however, the excess in either direction 
is over ten per cent, corrective measures should be taken. 

In ascertaining height, measure in shoes; stand erect, and press 
measuring rod down on scalp. Weigh yourself in indoor clothing 
and shoes. Subtract one inch for height if sensible heels are worn; 
if heels are "high, " subtract two inches. Your standard of weight 
is found where your height and age columns meet, '

SCHOOL LUNCHES 



TJie child is building the temple of the soul, planned by the divine 
Architect but ofttimes ruined by man's bad workmanship. 

Child Life. 



Upon the health and strength of our children the glory and greatness 
of our nation depend. 

Every child has a right to be as healthy as present knowledge can 
make him. Proper feeding is one of the chief factors in health. 

Health Education.

SCHOOL LUNCHES 

THE witty French cook who said, "Tell me what you eat, 
and I will tell you what you are, " might even more certainly 
have stated, "Tell me what you give your children to eat, and I 
will tell you what they will grow to be, " for the kind of food the 
child eats largely determines whether he will be a strong, healthy 
adult, or a weakling. More important, then, than the wise 
selection of foods for grown people is the proper feeding of the 
growing bodies of children especially of little children, 

A few general rules should be borne in mind: 

1. Meals should be given at regular times. 

2. No "nibbling" between meals. If a child is really hungry, a 
slice of bread and butter will satisfy the craving for food. Never 
give candy at such times. It will not only spoil the normal appe- 
tite, but will encourage a bad habit. Oftentimes a glass of water, 
and not food, is what the little one really craves. 

3. Teach the child to drink plenty of water between meals 
several glasses a day. 

4. Happiness while eating is essential to good digestion. 

5. Do not force a child to eat. If after a day or two the appetite 
does not return, consult a physician. 

6. Teach a child to wash face and hands before eating. Explain 
that dirt is dangerous. Explain that flies are dangerous. 

Teach a child to demand fresh air and sunshine, for they are 
the great cleansers of nature. 

7. Children may generally be taught to like all kinds of foods 
that are good for them. By giving a little of a new food at first, 
taste can be cultivated. 

Staple Food Requirements 

1. Milk is the best arid most important food for growing chil- 
dren. No other food can take its place. Children over five years 
of age should have at least three cups a day, more if possible. 

445 L-L 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 



Warm milk is more easily digested than cold milk. If children 
rebel against drinking plain milk, it may be given in the form of 
cocoa, milk soups, custards, etc. If it is impossible to get fresh 
milk, use dried milk. If neither fresh nor dried milk is procurable, 
use evaporated milk. If skimmed milk is given, the child should 
eat plenty of vegetables and cream or butter. Tea and coffee 
should not be given to growing children at all. 

Bread and milk form a perfect food, containing all food elements 
in the right proportion to sustain child life. The milk furnishes 
protein for muscles and other tissues; fats and sugar for body fuel; 
minerals for bones and other tissues; vitamins, essential to growth 
and health. The bread furnishes some of each of these, but is 
valuable because it provides starch fuel food, and gives bulk. 

2. Bread, cereals and other grain products should furnish about 
one-third the food required by a child. 

3. Vegetables are essential to the growing child not only for their 
food value, but because they contain vitamins (see page 40). 
The water in which vegetables and rice have been boiled should be 
used for making soups, sauces, and gravies. Where for any reason 
there is a scarcity of milk and eggs, the diet should include as much 
milk as possible, with pea or bean soups, spinach and other green 
vegetables, oatmeal, and dried fruits. Vegetables and fruits are 
excellent sources of iron and other elements necessary for growth. 
If combined with milk, they will supply food value fully equal to 
that of meat. 

4. Eggs, meat, etc. Aside from milk, eggs are the best source of 
protein for children. Where plenty of milk and an egg a day are 
included in the diet, a child needs very little meat. Allow not 
more than 2 ounces of meat a day for a child from 7-10 years; 3 
ounces daily from 10-14 years. Broth from stews may be given 
on vegetables and bread. 

5. Fruits. There should be some fruit in the diet every day. 
Where fresh fruit is not possible, use dried fruit. Bananas should 
not be eaten raw by very young children. Bananas are not ripe 
until the skins have brown spots. They should be cooked if given 
before they reach this stage. 

6. Sweets. There is danger of children getting too much sugar 
and spoiling the appetite. They should not have more than the 
following allowance, aside from that contained in foods: 

5 to 7 years 1 tablespoon daily 

7 to 12 years 2 tablespoons daily 

446 L - L 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 



It is better to give sugar in cocoa and desserts than as candy. 
Molasses has a high food value. Dates are a good substitute for 
candy. 

7. Fats are essential for growing children. Cream and butter, 
the fats of milk, are the most important kinds; therefore, children 
should have unskimmed milk. For the delicate child, cod-liver 
oil is an excellent fat, containing large quantities of vitamins, see 
page 420. Cod-liver oil may be procured in gelatine capsules, but 
if orange juice is given after, the child seldom objects to the oil. 
Other oils, such as olive, corn, and peanut, are good foods, too, in 
small quantities. (See Salads, page 167.) Young children should 
not have cooked fats except bacon fat, which is easily digested. 
All fried foods should be avoided. 

Children need at least three meals a day. The heavy meal 
should preferably come at mid-day, with a light supper, such as 
bread and whole milk, baked potatoes, stewed fruit; or cereal and 
milk, bread and butter, baked bananas; or poached egg on toast, 
baked potatoes, bread and butter, apple sauce, gingerbread. 

Desserts. Cooked desserts are not essential with plenty of bread 
and butter and vegetables and fruit. When given, they should be 
plain and simple; as cereal puddings with fruit, such as rice, oat- 
meal, or bread pudding. 

Home Lunches. If dinner is at the end of the day, let the lunch- 
eon be as light as the supper would be if the main meal were at 
mid-day. See end of this chapter for suggestions. 

Basket Lunches. School authorities are recognizing the impor- 
tance of a warm mid-day meal for children, and many schools pro- 
vide school lunches. If a child must carry a whole luncheon, it 
should be nutritious as well as appetizing. If possible let it include 
a bottle of milk. If it is practical for the child to use a thermos 
bottle, the milk may, of course, be w T arm; or hot cocoa, or soup may 
be provided by this means. The following suggestions should 
prove helpful : 

NOURISHING SANDWICHES APPETIZING FILLINGS 

Whole wheat bread Peanut butter 

Raisin bread Chopped celery with mayonnaise 

Toast Lettuce and tomato with dressing 

Nut bread Jelly, or chopped raisins 

Oatmeal muffins Chopped dates 

Rolls Chopped olives and peppers, mayon- 
naise dressing 

447 L-L 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 



See chapter on Sandwiches, page 287, for further suggestions. 
Desserts of custard, baked apple, sweet chocolate, maple sugar, 
sponge cake, fruit cookies, or gingerbread make a pleasant variety. 

It is essential for the children to have plenty of time in which to eat 
their mid-day meal. The child who bolts a meal and rushes back 
to school cannot either work or digest properly. It would be better 
to carry a lunch than to go home fora warm meal, if the journey 
means hurried eating. 

Summary. In the diet of the child the following is suggestive: 

WHAT FOODS TO AVOID WHAT FOODS MEAN GOOD HEALTH 

Coffee Milk 

Tea Vegetables 

Sodas Thick soups 

Much candy Cereals 

Doughnuts Fruits 

Much meat Honey and molasses 

Rich cakes Rice puddings 

Highly seasoned dishes Custards 

Pies Ice cream 

The School Lunch Room 

The school lunch room, which may be conducted by the Parent- 
Teacher Association or the Home and School Club, makes it possible 
for children to buy nourishing warm food for a few cents. This 
is a very pleasant arrangement for all children, but its chief value 
is in promoting the health of those who are under-nourished at 
home. The time will come, no doubt, when the authorities of 
every school will provide meals for all children who are under- 
weight, or who otherwise show malnutrition. 

Most housekeepers have collections of recipes of all kinds, but 
probably few have attempted to compile lists of dishes suitable for 
school lunches. A few suggestions may be welcome. By all means 
children should be instructed in the lunch room as to food values, 
and should not be allowed to select sweets or ice-cream in the place 
of substantial dishes. 

School Lunch Room Bills of Fare 

1. Vegetable or milk soup; crackers; rolls; fruit; plain cake; 
cocoa. 

2. Meat and vegetable stew; bread and butter; sweet chocolate. 

448 L-L 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 



3. Tomato soup; tapioca custard; lettuce sandwiches; fruit; 
cookies. 

4. Macaroni with cheese and tomato sauce; fruit; chopped date 
sandwiches. 

Milk and cocoa should always be provided. 

A few meat substitutes and "meat extenders." Scrambled eggs 
with minced ham or bacon; meat stew with vegetables; shep- 
herds's pie (meat pie with mashed potato cover) ; creamed frizzled 
beef on toast; fish cakes; salmon loaf; macaroni or spaghetti with 
tomato sauce; creamed potatoes au gratin. 



A LIST OF SOUPS 

Vegetable Soup Rice Pudding 

Cream of Pea Soup Boiled Custard 

Cream of Tomato Soup Tapioca and Fruit Pudding 

Dried Lima Bean Soup Bread Pudding 

Split Pea Soup Apple Betty with Cream 

Potato Soup Junket 

Corn Chowder Fruit, raw or cooked 

Fish Chowder Gingerbread or plain cake 

Cocoa for School Lunch Room, ^ 

Measure one pound of cocoa. Add as many cups of sugar as 
there are of cocoa. Add three cups of water. Cook until thick 
and glossy. Pour into jelly glasses or glass jars. Cover and set 
away. When cocoa is wanted for lunch use, prepare according 
to the following recipe : 

1 cup milk for each child. 

1V 2 tablespoons of the cocoa mixture 

Heat the milk scalding hot in a double boiler. Add the cocoa 
mixture. Beat well and serve. More sugar may be used in the 
mixture if it is found that the children desire it sweeter. 

NOTE. The tables of height and weight for girls and boys, pages 
450, 451, afford a standard for comparison only. In comparing a 
child's height and weight with the table, the type of build should 
be taken into account. A child of slender type might be under 
weight, and one of thick-set, stocky type might be over weight, 
and yet both be normally healthy. A slight variation is no cause 
for alarm, but if the difference amounts to ten per cent, however, 
corrective measures should be taken.

GOOD TO REMEMBER 

One teaspoon or tablespoon means a level teaspoon or tablespoon. 

A tin, aluminum or glass measuring cup should be used for all measuring. These 
cups are marked off in quarters and thirds and insure accuracy. 

Aluminum cooking utensils are the best for general use. They are expensive 
in the beginning, but outwear other kinds. They are light in weight and easily 
cleaned, and there ia no enamel to chip off and poison the food. 

Discolored pans and kettles, not aluminum, should be boiled in water to which 
a lump of washing soda has been added. 

Scrupulous cleanliness and eternal vigilance are the essentialsof all goodcooking. 

If the oven becomes too hot while bread or cake is baking, it may be cooled by 
setting a pan of water in it 

If bread or cake browns too quickly, cover with a piece of paper. 

Pies should always be baked in a quick oven, with the greatest heat at the bottom. 

Cakes will seldom stick if this direction is followed : Grease the pans carefully ; 
dust lightly with flour; shake out the superfluous flour and pour in the mixture. 

Muffins and gems will be lighter if baked in pans that have been thoroughly 
heated as well as greased. 

Biscuit dough should be as soft as possible. Biscuits will be lighter and 
crisper if not allowed to touch each other on the baking tin. 

Meat should never be put in cold water except in making soup, for cold water 
draws put the juices. Wipe with a wet cloth, or rinse and dry at once, and in cooking 
use boiling water. 

Tomatoes that are too strongly acid are improved by a pinch of baking soda. 
The soda should always be added when they are to be mixed with tnillr or cream, 
to prevent curdling. 

The white of eggs will whip more readily if a pinch of salt is added. The eggs 
should be as cold as possible. 

Cream that is too thin to whip may be made to do so by the addition of aa 
unbeaten white of egg. 

When dipping articles hi egg and cracker, dilute the egg with a tablespoon of 
water. Only the white may be used, if desired, but never only the yolk, as it is the 
albumen which is needed to form a coat which the grease cannot penetrate. 

Almost any dish is made more inviting by a little garnishing. Parsley, water- 
cress, slices of lemon, bfcet, onion, hard-boiled egg or maraschino cherry, small 
triangles of toast, potato balls, mashed potatoes pressed through a pastry tube 
all these are useful and within reach of almost every cook. Paper doilies, paper 
cups, and paper frills for chops may also be used to good advantage: these may to 
bought at any stationer's.
