Cookery .... means the econ-

THE INTRODUCTION 

This little series of books is a collection of tested and 
economical recipes for everyday foods that are obtainable 
everywhere and suitable for any of the three meals of the 
day. These recipes are written in plain, everyday terms. 
They are not all original — the authors of many of them 
are unknown. They form just a little series of everyday 
books for everybody from everywhere. 

The World War gave every homemaker an opportunity 
to realize the difference between use and abuse of foods. 
For years we have wasted much of the bountiful supply of 
food produced by our country. Let us then not go back- 
ward, but let us go forward, bending every energy to make 
lasting the benefit in health and economy gained from a 
diet that not only eliminates extravagance and waste in 
buying and serving, but also affords greater variety. 

The recipes in this series call for flour, sugar, and butter. 
To conserve these three foods just as long as our country 
and the peoples of Europe need them is the loyal and 
patriotic duty of — not the other fellow — but you. 

Measurements

CORN MEAL 

ORIGIN, USE, AND FOOD VALUE 

Origin. We are indebted to the Indians for many of 
the foods we are enjoying to-day, but the greatest gift 
they bestowed on modern civihzation was corn. The 
desire to produce this food was the incentive which led 
them to abandon their roaming hfe and to form settlements. 
Fish, game, and corn were their staple foods. 

We know the important part corn played in the early 
history of America, and how it saved many of the pioneers 
from starvation. Corn was unknown in Europe until 
after America was discovered, but, once it was introduced, 
its use spread rapidly, and to-day it is raised in every 
country where climatic conditions will permit. In Africa 
corn is known as ''mealies" and in Europe as ''maize." 

Food value. From the standpoint of economy and nour- 
ishment, few foods compare with corn m^eal. It is rich in 
fats and carbohydrates, but is lacking in protein. Corn 
contains twice as much fat, or oil, as wheat, three times 
as much as rye, and twice as much as barley. As compared 
to wheat, corn meal contains a little more fat and starch 
but less protein. 

How to buy corn meal. There are two common varieties 
of corn meal on the market, white and yellow. As a rule 
white com meal is the milder in flavor, but in composition 
and nutritive value there is no difference. Very finely 
ground and bolted meal does not make good bread. Rather 
select a medium-ground meal, either white or yellow.

Bi? BessU R. Murphy, Food Expert and Lecturer 

The books of this little series for school and home use are something 
more than a collection of tested recipes for the preparation of foods 
we know. They represent, besides, a thrifty and thinking use of 
home-grown foods to the most appetizing, economical, and healthful 
ends. 

Rice : For Breakfast, Dinner, and Supper. 

In the inviting recipes of this little book, rice is shown not only in 
its possibilities as a cereal, soup, salad, dinner vegetable, bread, dessert, 
and invalid food, but in its value for nourishment and energy, and as 
an admirable balance for the diet. 

Peanuts: For Breakfast, Dinner, and Supper. 

Wholesome, healthful, and flavorous, the humble peanut is presented 
in its countless uses for the table — as breads, meat substitutes, dressing 
for poultry, salads, desserts, candies, butter, and relishes — ^food prepa- 
rations that whet the appetite, and at the same time bring before us 
the importance of the peanut as a food. 

Corn Meal: For Breakfast, Dinner, and Supper. 

In the breads, griddlecakes, tamales, corn-cheese sticks, croquettes 
of meat, and other good things, the young cook gets not only a sug- 
gestion of the Indian feast — "green corn and venison" — but instruction 
as to how to prepare and cook properly corn-meal dishes that tempt 
the appetite. 

Potatoes : For Breakfast, Dinner, and Supper. 

Anyone who uses this book will approach potatoes, whether Irish 
or sweet, with a new interest. It is surprising how many toothsome 
changes may be rung on the necessary tuber in the way of breads, 
as a vegetable in combination with others, as croquettes, salads, 
doughnuts, cakes, pies. 

Legumes: Dried Beans, Peas, and Lentils. 

Under Legumes, the student comes to know the tmusual food value 
of beans, peas, and lentils, as compared with other vegetables and 
their cost, also that there are innumerable ways of preparing "the 
poor man's beef" in savory baked and stewed dishes, and soups.

HOME ECONOMICS SERIES 

LESSONS IN COOKERY 

jBp Frances EUzaheth Stewart, Instructor in Home Economics, 
Robert Lindblom Technical High SchooU Chicago 

This series, a two-year course for high schools, is a definite force 
for self-help. ^ Based upon economic values, and treating foods and 
their preparation for the child, adult, and invalid in relation to health, 
these four books not only make for better and more profitable service 
in the home, but they lay the foundation for a radical improvement 
in health for those who come under its influence. 

Food Economy. Book One consists of lessons in cooking care- 
fully planned to lower the cost of living and to attain the greatest values 
in food. Naturally "the balanced ration" and "complete dishes" 
are features of the book. Food Economy treats preservation of 
foods by means of drying and canning, "left-overs," inexpensive meat 
cuts, stews, meat substitutes, bread, and wheat substitutes, and gives 
invaluable exercises and aids for the use of the future housewife. 
$1.25 

Diet for Adults. In Book Two the needs of the worker are the 
subject of study, and calorie values are the basis of the dishes treated. 
Suitable diets for both hard and light workers are carefully considered. 
Problems in calorie values, such as the loo-calorie portion scheme, give 
the pupil thinking work to do $1.25 

Diet for Children. Book Three deals with suitable food for 
babies and children. For the older infant there are broths, gruels, and 
fruit juices, and for children of four to eight years, such dishes as cereals, 
cream soups, simple fruit and milk desserts. The older child also has 
attention. Sections on lunch boxes, parties, and penny lunchrooms 
have point for teacher, parent, and pupil $1.25 

Diet for Invalids. Book Four gives an interesting insight into 
foods in their relation to disease. Here are bran breads and dried 
foods useful for elimination diseases, special diet for diabetes and 
fever patients, and for children wasting from malnutrition; here are 
foods valuable for iron, fats, and proteins. The book is one of worth, 
not only to the teacher and pupil, but to the nurse and mother. .$1.25
