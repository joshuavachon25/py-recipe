PREFACE 

LIBRARY 

"Of making many (cook) books there is no end." 

Ecclesiastes xii: 12. 

In imposing another contribution of a culinary nature on a 
long-suffering public, I offer a word of justification, if not of 
apology. 

The gleanings of a good many pleasant years are em- 
bodied in the following pages. The publication of "High 
Living" and the kind reception accorded to it bore in upon 
me the need of presenting to the American housewife a few 
dishes borrowed from foreign countries and possessing the 
merit of being cheap and easy to prepare. 

In making my selection from a large stock of material at 
hand, I have chosen, in many cases, those recipes which will 
help to keep down the cost of living. For example, I have 
rejected the national cake of Russia, served at Easter, which 
calls for 1000 or more eggs, in favor of the humble confec- 
tion which contains no eggs at all. 

In our cosmopolitan San Francisco we have singular op- 
portunities of varying the monotony of our menus, and, in 
epitomizing this collection, I have been struck with the 
divergencies in preparations which contain the same ingre- 
dients. It is no less remarkable that in cookery as in folk- 
lore striking resemblances can be found in races remote 
from each other in space, origin and language. 

The recipes are arranged as far as practicable for six 
people and are intended for those who understand the rudi- 
ments of cooking. 

I have included in these pages original contributions of 
certain resourceful housekeepers of our own State which 
ordinarily would not have appeared in print.

Breads 




Breads 



574. BRIOCHE FRENCH 

Sift half a pound of flour ; put a fourth of it into a bowl 
and make a Avell in the middle ; dissolve a level teaspoon of 
compressed yeast in a little lukewarm water; pour it into 
the well and mix it with the flour, little by little, until it is 
a smooth dough ; knead well and put it again in the bowl 
(floured) ; cover and stand in a warm place. Make a well 
in the rest of the flour and pour in two tablespoons of milk, 
mixed with a teaspoon of salt and two of sugar ; mix well, 
break in an egg and beat hard three or four minutes; add 
another egg and repeat until three eggs have been used; 
then beat in a half cup of softened butter. Now mix the two 
doughs together and knead only enough to form a very soft 
ball, which place again in the well-floured bowl ; cover with 
flannel and place in a warm spot to rise for twelve hours. 
Cut the dough into small pieces, which form into buns of 
medium size with a twist at the top, or crescents. Place 
in a greased tin and when they have risen nicely bake in a 
moderate oven. 

575. CRISSINI (BREAD STICKS) ITALIAN 

Cut a small portion from risen bread dough that is ready 
to be shaped into loaves; roll into pieces the length and

oven until crisp and dry. 

576. CRUMPETS ENGLISH

and leave again, repeating the process three times. Lay 
greased crumpet rings on a floured baking tin, half fill with

and all. Cool, split open, toast, slip butter between and 
serve very hot in a napkin. 

577. DANISH BLACK BREAD 

Dissolve a fourth of a cake of compressed yeast in a little 
lukewarm water; add a tablespoon of sugar and a quart of 
sour milk. Mix with enough rye meal to make a stiff batter,

fifteen minutes ; cover and let rise ten or twelve hours in a 
warm place ; then knead for twenty minutes. Form into a 
loaf, place into a greased bread pan and, when light, bake in 
a moderate oven for two hours. It will make one big loaf. 

578. FLAT BREAD SCANDINAVIAN 

Boil and mash six large peeled potatoes ; add a teaspoon 
of salt and enough flour to make a stiff dough ; roll out as

corners of each into the center and serve with butter, sugar 
and cinnamon. 



579. LANCASHIRE CAKES ENGLISH 

Mix two cups of hot mashed potatoes with enough flour to 
make a stiff paste ; add a tablespoon of butter and a slightly 
beaten egg and a half cup of cleaned currants ; roll out sev-

quickly on both sides and split, butter, and serve very hot. 

580. POTATO SCONES YORKSHIRE 

Boil and mash four medium-sized potatoes and, while hot, 
stir in a handful of oatmeal and a little salt. Sift some self- 
raising flour on the pastry board and knead the potato in it 
until stiff enough to roll out. Cut with a large cutter, prick 
with a fork and bake on a hot griddle. Split and butter and 
serve hot. The secret lies in making them so quickly that 
the potatoes are still warm when baked.

PREFACE 

"Of making many (cook) books there is no end." 

Ecclesiastes xii : 12. 

In imposing another contribution of a culinary nature on a 
long-suffering public, I offer a word of justification, if not of 
apology. 

The gleanings of a good many pleasant years are em- 
bodied in the following pages. The publication of ''High 
Living" and the kind reception accorded to it bore in upon 
me the need of presenting to the American housewife a few 
dishes borrowed from foreign countries and possessing the 
merit of being cheap and easy to prepare. 

In making my selection from a large stock of material at 
hand, I have chosen, in many cases, those recipes which will 
help to keep down the cost of living. For example, I have 
rejected the national cake of Russia, served at Easter, which 
calls for 1000 or more eggs, in favor of the humble confec- 
tion which contains no eggs at all. 

In our cosmopolitan San Francisco we have singular op- 
portunities of varying the monotony of our menus, and, in 
epitomizing this collection, I have been struck with the 
divergencies in preparations which contain the same ingre- 
dients. It is no less remarkable that in cookery as in folk- 
lore striking resemblances can be found in races remote 
from each other in space, origin and language. 

The recipes are arranged as far as practicable for six 
people and are intended for those who understand the rudi- 
ments of cooking. 

I have included in these pages original contributions of 
certain resourceful housekeepers of our own State which 
ordinarily would not have appeared in print. 

L. L, MCLAREN.

PREFACE 

"Of making many (cook) books there is no end." 

— Ecclesiastes xii: 12. 

In imposing' another contribution of a culinary nature on a 
long-suffering public, I offer a word of justification, if not of 
apology. 

The gleanings of a good many pleasant years are em- 
bodied in the following pages. The publication of "High 
Living" and the kind reception accorded to it bore in upon 
me the need of presenting to the American housewife a few 
dishes borrowed from foreign countries and possessing the 
merit of being cheap and easy to prepare. 

In making my selection from a large stock of material at 
hand, I have chosen, in many cases, those recipes which will 
help to keep down the cost of living. For example, I have 
rejected the national cake of Russia, served at Easter, which 
calls for 1000 or more eggs, in favor of the humble confec- 
tion which contains no eggs at all. 

In our cosmopolitan San Francisco we have singular op- 
portunities of varying the monotony of our menus, and, in 
epitomizing this collection, I have been struck with the 
divergencies in preparations which contain the same ingre- 
dients. It is no less remarkable that in cookery as in folk- 
lore striking resemblances can be found in races remote 
from each other in space, origin and language. 

The recipes are arranged as far as practicable for six 
people and are intended for those who understand the rudi- 
ments of cooking. 

I have included in these pages original contributions of 
certain resourceful housekeepers of our own State which 
ordinarily would not have appeared in print.

Breads 




Breads 



574. BRIOCHE— FRENCH 

Sift half a pound of flour ; put a fourth of it into a bowl 
and make a well in the middle ; dissolve a level teaspoon of 
compressed yeast in a little lukewarm water; pour it into 
the well and mix it with the flour, little by little, until it is 
a smooth dough ; knead well and put it again in the bowl 
(floured) ; cover and stand in a warm place. Make a well 
in the rest of the flour and pour in two tablespoons of milk, 
mixed with a teaspoon of salt and two of sugar ; mix well, 
break in an egg and beat hard three or four minutes; add 
another egg, and repeat until three eggs have been used; 
then beat in a half cup of softened butter. Now mix the two 
doughs together and knead only enough to form a very soft 
ball, which place again in the well-floured bowl ; cover with 
flannel and place in a warm spot to rise for twelve hours.

and leave again, repeating the process three times. Lay 
greased crumpet rings on a floured baking tin, half fill with

577. DANISH BLACK BREAD 

Dissolve a fourth of a cake of compressed yeast in a little

PREFACE 

"Of making many (cook) books there is no end." 

— Ecclesiastes xii: 12. 

In imposing another contribution of a culinary nature on a 
lohg-suffcring public, I offer a word of justification, if not of 
apology. 

The gleanings of a good many pleasant years are em- 
bodied in the following pages. The publication of "High 
Living*' and the kind reception accorded to it bore in upon 
me the need of presenting to the American housewife a few 
dishes borrowed from foreign countries and possessing the 
merit of being cheap and easy to prepare. 

In making my selection from a large stock of material at 
hand, I have chosen, in many cases, those recipes which will 
help to keep down the cost of living. For example, I have 
rejected the national cake of Russia, served at Easter, which 
calls for 1000 or more eggs, in favor of the humble confec- 
tion which contains no eggs at all. 

In our cosmopolitan San Francisco we have singular op- 
portunities of varying the monotony of our menus, and, in 
epitomizing this collection, I have been struck with the 
divergencies in preparations which contain the same ingre- 
dients. It is no less remarkable that in cookery as in folk- 
lore striking resemblances can be found in races remote 
from each other in space, origin and language. 

The recipes are arranged as far as practicable for six 
people and are intended for those who understand the rudi- 
ments of cooking. 

I have included in these pages original contributions of 
certain resourceful housekeepers of our own State which 
ordinarily would not have appeared in print. 

L. L. McLaren.

Breads 



Breads 



574. BRIOCHE— FRENCH 

Sift half a pound of flour ; put a fourth of it into a bowl 
and make a well in the middle ; dissolve a level teaspoon of 
compressed yeast in a little lukewarm water; pour it into 
the well and mix it with the flour, little by little, until it is 
a smooth dough ; knead well and put it again in the bowl 
(floured) ; cover and stand in a warm place. Make a well 
in the rest of the flour and pour in two tablespoons of milk, 
mixed with a teaspoon of salt and two of sugar ; mix well, 
break in an egg and beat hard three or four minutes; add 
another egg and repeat until three eggs have been used; 
then beat in a half cup of softened butter. Now mix the two 
doughs together and knead only enough to form a very soft 
ball, which place again in the well-floured bowl ; cover with 
flannel and place in a warm spot to rise for twelve hours. 
Cut the dough into small pieces, which form into buns of 
medium size with a twist at the top, or crescents. Place 
in a greased tin and when they have risen nicely bake in a 
moderate oven. 

575. CRISSINI (BREAD STICKS)— ITALIAN 

Cut a small portion from risen bread dough that is ready 
to be shaped into loaves; roll into pieces the length and 
thickness of macaroni; place in rows on a greased baking 
pan an inch apart; set to rise again until double in size; 
then bake in a quick oven. Cool and bake again in a slow 
oven until crisp and dry. 

576. CRUMPETS— ENGLISH 

Make a very soft sponge of a large boiled potato, mashed ; 
a teaspoon of salt, a yeast-cake, dissolved in a quart of luke- 
warm water, and sifted flour. Cover and leave in a warm 
place for half an hour, then beat well with a wooden spoon 
and leave again, repeating the process three times. Lay 
greased crumpet rings on a floured baking tin, half fill with 



BREADS 152 

the batter and cook on a hot stove, turning frequently, ring 
and all. Cool, split open, toast, slip butter between and 
serve very hot in a napkin. 

577. DANISH BLACK BREAD 

Dissolve a fourth of a cake of compressed yeast in a little 
lukewarm water ; add a tablespoon of sugar and a quart of 
sour milk. Mix with enough rye meal to make a stiff batter, 
after which work in flour with the hands and knead for 
fifteen minutes ; cover and let rise ten or twelve hours in a 
warm place ; then knead for twenty minutes. Form into a 
loaf, place into a greased bread pan and, when light, bake in 
a moderate oven for two hours. It will make one big loaf. 

578. FLAT BREAD— SCANDINAVIAN 

Boil and mash six large peeled potatoes ; add a teaspoon 
of salt and enough flour to make a stiff dough ; roll out as 
thin as paper, cut in large squares and bake on the top of a 
stove without any pan — turning when brown. Fold the four 
corners of each into the center and serve with butter, sugar 
and cinnamon. 

579. LANCASHIRE CAKES— ENGLISH 

Mix two cups of hot mashed potatoes with enough flour to 
make a stiff paste ; add a tablespoon of butter and a slightly 
beaten egg and a half cup of cleaned currants ; roll out sev- 
eral times and finally cut into rounds as large as a small 
plate, half an inch thick. Dust a griddle with flour, brown 
quickly on both sides and split, butter, and serve very hot. 

580. POTATO SCONES— YORKSHIRE 

Boil and mash four medium-sized potatoes and, while hot, 
stir in a handful of oatmeal and a little salt. Sift some self- 
raising flour on the pastry board and knead the potato in it 
until stiff enough to roll out. Cut with a large cutter, prick 
with a fork and bake on a hot griddle. Split and butter and 
serve hot. The secret lies in making them so quickly that 
the potatoes are still warm when baked.

around the edges of each quickly, before it gets cold. They 
should be about three inches in diameter and rather thin. 

584. PLATANOS DULCE— GUATEMALAN 

Boil six plantains, or large sweet potatoes, until tender; 
while they are cooking make a syrup of two cups of sugar 
and a cup of water, boiling for twelve minutes and skimming 
carefully ; peel the potatoes quickly, cut into thick slices and 
throw into the boiling syrup to simmer until thoroughly 
soaked with it; skim out carefully and drain on a wire 
broiler for two hours, then throw into fresh clear syrup to 
steep for a few minutes; drain again and let stand until 
rather dry; roll in powdered sugar mixed with cinnamon 
and wrap each piece in oiled paper. Keep in a cool, dry 
place until used.

of vanilla; then stir it on the slab until it grains. Knead 
with your hand until it cools, then pat out into a smooth
