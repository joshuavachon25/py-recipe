PREFACE. 



'TH V HIS companion volume to Warne's Model Cookery Book 
"*" has been in course of preparation for more than three years. 
During its progress the Editor has attentively watched for all 
new discoveries in Science or Art, and has carefully tested the 
receipts and advice sent in by Contributors, so as to ensure their 
practical utility. 

Of the Articles, the one on Potatoes is from the pen of Miss 
Hartshorn e, well known from her own and her father's talents > 
Miss Jewry, the Editor of the Model Cookery, has examined 
or contributed the additional Cookery receipts and useful House 
hold information; Major McCoy and two ladies of good posi- 
tion contribute first-rate amateur experience of the Poultry Yard. 

The Stable and the Dairy are original articles by competent 
authorities. 

For " Domestic Science " (though chiefly original), use has been 
made of Professor Pepper's "Cyclopaedic Science." The "History 
of Pottery and Porcelain," by Joseph Marryat, Esq. (which every 
householder of taste in Ceramic Art should possess), has afforded 
some of the information given with regard to old china, in 



vi Preface. 

addition to the personal experience of the editor. The works 
of Henderson, Cyrus Redding, and the Supplement to the 
" Encyclopaedia Britannica " are briefly quoted — in conjunction with 
the practical knowledge of a first-rate wine merchant — on the 
subject of wines. 

The advice how to act in case of accidents, the remedies 
for poisoning, and instructions for the care of the sick, have 
been contributed by an experienced Surgeon. 

The Plates, printed in Colours by Kronheim & Co., have 
been executed from original designs by eminent artists. 

The Publishers and Editor unite in offering their best thanks 
to numerous Contributors, and trust that their labours may be 
rewarded by the acknowledged utility of a popular and practical 
Manual of Household Economy.

THE 

MODERN HOUSEHOLDER. 



INTRODUCTION. 

To a people who dwell so much in their homes as the English, any 
information which can tend to make those seats of domestic life happier, 
more comfortable, brighter, and more attractive, should be welcome; and 
that it is so, the success of most of the popular home literature bears 
evidence. 

There are numerous works on the subject of housekeeping, but 
every day modern Science adds to our knowledge of facts tending to im- 
prove domestic comfort, and to promote health. Lectures on cookery, 
schools for instruction in it, the Food Gallery of the South Kensington 
Museum, offer us a surprising amount of information as to the most 
nourishing diet and the best mode of preparing it ; while the secrets of 
chemistry and the principles of art and of good taste are placed freely 
before us, to assist us in cleansing and adorning our dwellings. To 
gather up some crumbs from this banquet of knowledge has been our en- 
deavour in this volume, which, though not exclusively designed for the 
mistress of the household (the stable-yard, etc. being exceptions) will still, 
we trust, prove most acceptable to those in whom the " rightful sway and 
due supremacy " of home is centred — the " housemother," as the Germans 
expressively style her. 

It is not too much to say that the welfare — present and future — 
of the family depends chiefly on the manner in which the Mother 
sways the domestic sceptre. Freedom from painful pecuniary anxieties, 
comfort, health, peace, and joy all depend mainly on her wise use 
of the power entrusted to her. Even future generations may be in- 
fluenced for good by her care, or for evil by her indolence and neglect. For 
executing so great a trust, knowledge is imperatively necessary. The 
tenderest and best-meaning ignorance often injures where it would fain 
serve; and modern education has been somewhat to blame in not blending 
more of domestic training with the accomplishments which would well 
harmonize with it. Artistic taste has a wide field for its exercise in the home, 
and music is one of its best relaxations ; the arts need not be abandoned 
for the scientific knowledge which is so important, nor for household duties, 
which when well and regularly performed occupy no great deal of time. 
We believe, as education takes a higher and more thorough tone, domestic 
knowledge will advance with it. Every little aid which can be given on the 
subject should meantime be afforded ; and it is in order to add our mite to 

B 



Introduction. 



the general attempt in this direction that we have collected from many 
sources, and gathered from the memoranda of old families numerous re- 
ceipts for domestic needs, and have also attempted to offer some popular 
hints on Science in its connexion with daily life, and on the constituents 
of the food which supports our existence. To give the analysis of every 
article of it was not possible in a volume of this size, containing so much 
also of other matter ; we have contented ourselves, therefore, with pre- 
senting a general idea of the constituents of animal and vegetable 
substances, to guide the housekeeper in judiciously assorting the materials 
which spread her table. 

The article on the Dairy is from the pen of a writer practically and 
thoroughly acquainted with the subject ; the same may be said of those 
on the Stable-yard and Poultry-yard. 

The prescriptions for slight family ailments ; the hints of what should 
be done in case of accidents or poisoning ; the articles on ventilation, 
the sick room, climate, sleep, diet in relation to disease, etc. etc., have 
been contributed by a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and 
may therefore be entirely relied on. 

Neither have we forgotten the speechless (we cannot say mute) friends 
who often share our dwellings ; some knowledge of their ways and wants 
cannot fail to be useful, and the experience of the accomplished writer on 
Domestic Pets assures the excellence of her instructions. 

One thought has forcibly presented itself to the Editors mind while she 
has been occupied with her task, — namely, how wonderfully the wisdom 
and goodness of the Creator are displayed in the system by which all his 
creatures are fed ; and by the adaptation of different kinds of food to their 
need and comfort. How marvellous is that great chain of being by 
which animals depend on vegetation for existence ; man on animals with 
vegetation, and vegetation itself on the breath of animal life ;— all in the 
first place nourished by the bounteous earth, and her mantle of air — for 
the analysis of food might go far deeper than the constituents given in our 
tables, and be traced back to the gases themselves. 

We believe that even so superficial and popular a sketch as we have 
given of this subject — we trust it may lead to real study of the matter — - 
can scarcely fail to impress the mind with awe, and gratitude to Him who 
" openeth His hand and filleth all things living with plenteousness." 



THE HIRED HOUSE. 



The choice of a house is a matter of no small moment. It must be 
directed necessarily in the first place by the means of the inmate, or by 
the needs of his position or profession. 

It is usual to say that the rent and taxes of the house should not 
exceed the eighth part of the occupier's income. We believe that this 
rule is rarely carried out. A man often requires a large and well-situated 
house in town for his profession ; it would be ruin for him to live in a 
cheap house in a shabby or poor neighbourhood ; or well-born and well- 
connected poor people find that they must (to retain their position in 
society) live in a higher rented locality than they can quite afford. In 
these cases the housewife will often be required to exercise more vigilant 
economy than might otherwise be necessary. (Let us advise her to 
practise it on superfluities and dress : but of this hereafter.) 

Next to the requirements of means and position, we must put those of 
health. In fact they ought to be our chief consideration, for no house is 
cheap if it be ill-drained, ill-ventilated, damp or dark, — defects on account 
of which houses are often let cheaply, and considered bargains. Alas ! is 
the dwelling cheap which is paid for with life, or energy ? 

Let the householder, therefore, select as healthy a locality as circum- 
stances will admit, with a clear passage for air at the front and back of the 
house — taking care that the outer air does not pass over any nuisances, as 
dirt-heaps, uncovered sewers or ditches, in its way to the open windows, 
bringing poison — slow and fatal — on its wings ! 

His next care should be to inquire carefully about the drainage of the 
future home. The hirer should ascertain if there is a sufficient fall for it ; 
if the pipes are large enough to carry off accidental stoppages ; and above 
all, if there are syphons placed to prevent the return of bad gas. Without 
these no drainage is perfect. It is often difficult to ascertain the exact 
truth as to these facts from the landlord, or from previous inmates ; but 
on entering upon the occupancy a little attention to the smells of the house 
will suffice to prove whether all is right or not. The landlord is bound to 
keep the drainage in order, and an appeal (if he refuses) to the inspector 
of nuisances will shortly set all right. But we warn the housewife that 
she must herself be careful that the servants do not pour cabbage water 
down the back kitchen sink ; as the smell of it — a singularly unpleasant 
one — is so strong that it will penetrate all over the house, and produce the 
suspicion of a bad drain. The water in which any kind of cabbage has 
been boiled, should be thrown away out of doors, in a distant corner of 
the garden, if possible ; chloride of lime dissolved in water should occa. 
sionally be poured down the drains also, to secure disinfection of all kinds. 

B 2 



The Hired House. 



Miss Nightingale says, " It would be curious to ascertain by inspection 
how many houses in London are really well drained. Many people would 
say surely all or most of them. But many people have no idea in wha.t good 
drainage consists. They think that a sewer in the street, and a pipe 
leading to it from the house is good drainage. All the while the sewer 
may be nothing but a laboratory from which epidemic disease and ill 
health is being distilled into the house. No house with any untrapped 
drain-pipe communicating immediately with a sewer, whether it be from 
•water-closet, sink, or gully-grate, can ever be healthy. An untrapped sink 
may at any time spread fever or pyaemia among the inmates of a palace .* 

" The ordinary oblong sink is an abomination. That great surface of 
stone, which is always left wet, is always exhaling into the air. I have 
known whole houses and hospitals smell of the sink. I have met just as 
strong a stream of sewer air coming up the back staircase of a grand 
London house from the sink, as I have ever met at Scutari ; and I have 
seen the rooms in that house all ventilated by the open doors, and the 
passages all 7^«ventilated by the closed windows, in order that as much of 
the sewer air as possible might be conducted into and retained in the bed- 
rooms. It is wonderful ! 

" Another great evil in house construction is carrying drai ns under- 
neath the house. Such drains are never safe. All house-drains should 
begin and end outside the walls." 

Ventilatioti is of as much importance as good drainage. The air we 
breathe contains the principle of life or death. Oxygen, or pure air, is life- 
giving ; carbonic acid (or impure air) is fatal to animal life. 

The free circulation of air prevents the accumulation of the vitiated 
particles which form carbonic acid, and thus increases the amount of 
oxygen. 

The danger of breathing impure air is great. It is carbonic acid (a 
state of bad air) which frequently kills the miner, or the man who 
descends into a well ; it is the carbonic acid in the air of crowded rooms, 
or churches, which causes head-ache and drowsiness, for it is a narcotic 
poison, and from it also (tainted with other impurities) come the fatal 
fever, cholera, and many other kinds of infection. Every room, there- 
fore, should be well ventilated, especially sleeping-rooms, which should 
never be used unless there is a fire-place in them, or a panel of perforated 
zinc in the door. We will explain why : — The breath of each person 
occupying a room corrupts a certain portion of air. A part of the air 
imbibed by breathing is returned by the exhaled breath in the form of 
carbonic acid. Thus gradually, if there be no ventilation or circulation 
of fresh air in the room, the whole atmosphere of the chamber becomes 
poisonous and sometimes fatal, producing death in sleep — a kind of 
apoplexy, or if it is survived, generating afterwards putrid fever. 

It was the carbonic acid exhaled from their own lungs, and not dispersed 

• " God lays down certain physical laws. Upon His carrying out such laws 
depends our responsibility (that much abused word), for how could we have any 
responsibility for actions, the results of which we could not foresee — which would 
be the case if the carrying out of His laws were not certain. Yet we seem to be 
continually expecting that He will work a miracle— i.e., break His own laws 
expressly to relieve us of responsibility." 



Ventilation. 5 



by ventilation, which killed the unhappy prisoners of the Rajah of Bengal 
in the Black Hole of Calcutta, as the small chamber in which they were 
confined was called. It is carbonic acid settled on the floor of the Grotto 
del Cane, in Italy, which stupifies the poor dogs sometimes driven into 
it ; it is carbonic acid settled in the jungle — through which no wind 
can penetrate — that kills men and beasts in the fatal Valley of Death in 
Java ; and the same deadly foe to life and health exists in every ill-venti- 
lated and over-crowded house. Let us therefore, if we would be well and 
happy, carefully supply our apartments with pure air by ventilation- 
opening windows and keeping the register of the fireplace open. 

We must here observe that the eye of the mistress is especially re- 
quired to secure that the stove-registers are left open when no fires are in 
the grates. Housemaids almost invariably shut the register when fires are 
not lighted, and many a headache and morning drowsiness may be traced 
to the fact. The unconscious occupant of a chamber falls asleep in a 
room with closed shutters and door, and shut-up grate ; gradually his 
breath poisons the air, and, if the room be small, he has before morning 
absorbed into his blood (by re-breathing) the tainted air which carries 
in it the seeds of disease. An open register admits fresh air to replace 
that which is vitiated by breathing. If air enters by chinks or keyhole, 
the draught will be towards the fireplace ; therefore care should be taken 
not to place the bed between the fireplace and a door or window. 

A fire in a room is a great purifier of the air, and when it can be 
afforded should be used in bedrooms. 

There are always two currents of air in a room ; one of hot air 
flowing out of the room, and another of cold air flowing into the 
room. This may be proved by holding a lighted candle near the top of 
the door. You will perceive on doing so, that the flame will be blown 
outwards towards the hall or passage. But if you hold the candle at the 
bottom of the door the flame will be blown into the room ; this is not 
the case when there is a fire in the room ; then an inward current is 
drawn through all the crevices. 

Heated air always ascends towards the ceiling, and floating about in the 
upper part of the room, escapes through any opening or crevice to be found 
there. The empty space (vacuum) left by the ascent of the hot air is in- 
stantly filled by the outer and colder air rushing in. This cold air drives or 
presses the hot air out. Thus the reader will perceive that to free the air 
of a room from impurity the windows should be opened at the top, — to 
cool a room the windows should be open at the bottom, that is, the lower 
sash should be raised, as the cold air will rush in there. The upper sash 
must be opened for ventilation. 

There is no draught from the open upper sash, as thought ; the warm 
and bad air rushes out of it. There is a considerable draught from 
an open lower sash, as through it cold air is rushing into the room. This 
fact is very important to be known by those who are nursing invalids. 

A ventilator is absolutely necessary when gas is burned in the room. 

We add here a paper on ventilation, by an eminent surgeon whose 
instructions may be taken as authoritative. 



VENTILATION. 

The ventilation of dwelling-houses, although as important as that of 
churches and other buildings in which large numbers of people congre- 
gate, has, however, been almost entirely overlooked until lately, or has 
been allowed to take quite a subordinate place in the architect's plans. 
Gas illumination having in a great measure superseded that of candles 
and lamps, it becomes a more urgent necessity to provide some means for 
carrying off the products of combustion. These products are more 
complex and more dangerous for respiration than those from candles and 
lamps ; yet modern houses, although generally furnished with gas-fittings, 
are built without any provision for a supply of fresh air, or for the carrying 
off of the foul air. It is an established physiological law that no room 
should afford less than a thousand cubic feet of air for each person in 
health, under the ordinary conditions of inlet and outlet ; for the sick- 
room not less than one thousand cubic feet should be allowed to each 
patient. This quantity of space is the least that is allowed for patients 
in the large hospitals recently erected. There is one simple principle 
that should guide all contrivances for ventilation purposes — viz., to secure 
a constant change of the atmosphere. 

Thorough change of the air of a chamber involves the admission of 
pure air on the one side and the removal of the vitiated air on the other. 

In ordinary rooms, this is imperfectly effected by the fireplace, and by 
the imperfect closure of door and window frames. It is, perhaps, a source 
of some consolation that the very imperfection of modern domestic archi- 
tecture offers some degree of immunity from the consequences of breathing 
air that is vitiated, either by the lungs of human beings, or by the com- 
bustion of gas. We have heard modern houses, in this respect, described 
as patent self-acting ventilators. 

This haphazard mode of ventilation is unscientific and insufficient, 
being effected only by draughts of air which cannot always be borne 
without risk to the health. To secure the thorough change of air that has 
been spoken of, a good ventilator should be placed in the chimney, or some 
part of the wall communicating with the outer air if there be no chimney. 
As nearly as possible opposite to the ventilator a flow of pure air should be 
secured at the top of the room as well as near the floor. If only admitted 
in the latter position, the heated impure air will collect at the top of the 
room under the ceiling, and gradually intermingle with the air below. 
By a little skilful management of the cornice, or other ornamentation 
along the top of the wall of the room, concealed perforations may be made 
that shall admit a flow of pure air which will mingle with that which may 
also be admitted in like manner by concealed perforations in or behind 
the skirting-board. 

If there be a fireplace in the room, a very free admixture of these two 
air-supplies will take place before they reach the fireplace, which they will 
surely do by virtue of the suction power of the heated air in the chimney. 

It may here be stated that in the summer time, when fires are not being 
used, there is a draught up the chimney, as may be seen by holding a 
lighted taper at its mouth. A downward current may in the winter time 
be obtained by the same means, from a chimney in which there is no fire. 



Hiring Houses. 




We have said that a good ventilator is an essential part of the system for 
complete ventilation of a room. A ventilator to be perfect should be self- 
acting with the current of air. Arnott's are hung on an erroneous plan, the 
reverse of what they should be. Being fixed on a hinge at the lower border, 
the valve requires a counterbalancing weight to make it swing with the cur- 
rent of air, whereas if it be suspended from its upper edge at a proper angle, 
and be made of some light material, 
as talc, it will open with the slightest 
upward flow, and be effectually closed 
by the reverse movement, the down- 
ward current of the air. The valve 
by this arrangement prevents the 
back escape of smoke into the room, 
and secures the exit of the vitiated 
air. This form of ventilator will act 
equally well with or without the pre- 
sence of a fire in the grate. They 
are also made so as to serve for the 
ventilation of halls and other public buildings. 

A great mistake is often made in warming rooms by gas burners. 
More particularly is this objectionable in a sick room, where pure air is 
required more than anywhere. If any one will take the trouble to notice, 
he will find that, on going from the fresh air into a room in which gas is 
burning (without sufficient ventilation, or a flue to carry off the vapour), 
there will be distinctly perceptible a more or less pungent smell of sulphu- 
rous and other vapours. Where therefore gas is used for the purpose of 
warming, the warmth is obtained at the cost of the purity of the air. An 
open fireplace is not only a source of warmth, but it is also a means 
of ventilation and purification of the air. 

HIRING HOUSES. 

Houses may be hired for any period. By agreement for three years, or 
by leases of 7, 14, or 21 years, or by the week, month, quarter, or year, if 
the landlord chooses. The rent for the lease is generally lower than the 
rent for a three years' term. The three years' occupancy rent again is 
generally less than that paid by the year. The drawing out of a lease is 
very expensive, never, we believe, much less than 8/., and frequently 
more. There is nothing paid for the form of an agreement for three 
years, or at least not more than a guinea. 

' A tenant for a long lease generally agrees to do the repairs, and to 
paint the house inside and out, at certain fixed periods. Unless there is 
an express agreement in the lease to the contrary, a tenant is bound to 
pay his rent even after his premises have been destroyed by fire. Even 
if the landlord has insured the premises against fire, the tenant will 
still remain liable for the rent if they should be burned down, and 
he cannot compel the landlord to rebuild. But if the landlord has 
entered into a covenant or agreement to keep the house in good and 
tenantable repair, and it be burned down, or otherwise destroyed, though 
at law the tenant would still remain liable for the rent, in equity, it is 
submitted, he would be entitled to relief during the time the premises 
remained urdnhabitable. As repairs are generally undertaken by the 



8 Hiring Houses. 



landlord in a three years' agreement, it is manifestly safest we think 
to take a house for that period, rather than on a lease, even allowing 
that the rent should be a little higher than for the latter. But without a 
special agreement, the tenant is still liable for the rent after the house is 
burned down. To avoid this risk a householder may insure for his rent 
yearly at any Insurance office. Then, if he is burned out, the office pays 
the year's rent. 

A tenant is not bound to repair damages by tempest, lightning, or 
inundation. 

If the landlord agrees to repair, and fails to do so, the tenant or lessee 
may do the repairs himself, and deduct it from the rent. 

If a lessee remains in his house after the expiration of his lease, he 
is liable for rent accruing after the termination of the lease. If he is 
allowed to remain in possession without renewing his lease, he is called a 
tenant by sufferance, and pays the same rent which he was charged 
during the lease. On the landlord's accepting any rent after the lease 
has terminated, the tenant becomes a yearly tenant, and must receive 
a half-year's notice to quit. No notice to quit is necessary when the 
house is held for a fixed period — as three years — the tenancy expiring with 
the time. But if the tenant be a yearly one, (and all who have not agreed 
to take their houses for a fixed period are held to be yearly tenants,) 
notice to quit must be given six months before the expiration of the 
year, so that the notice may expire on the very day the tenant 
entered into possession of the dwelling : — for example, if the house 
was taken December 25th, notice to quit must be given on June 24th, 
and the tenant must leave at the date he entered. If a house is taken 
by the quarter, a quarter's notice to quit must be given ; if by the month, 
a month's notice ; if by the week, a week's notice. Yearly rent is paid 
quarterly — i.e., on March 25th, June 24th, September 29th, December 
25th — and may be demanded on any of those days between sunrise 
and sunset ; but few people pay their rent to the day. It is usually 
settled during the following week, and (if collected) is seldom sent for 
under three weeks from the day. Weekly rent is paid weekly ; if suffered 
to run on to the quarter the tenant becomes a quarterly tenant. The rates 
and taxes paid by the landlord are, property tax — land tax — ground rent, 
and sewers' rates, which the tenant pays for him, but deducts from the 
rent during the current year. Most frequently however, the landlord 
stipulates in the agreement that the tenant shall pay the sewerage rates. 
The house tax is paid by the tenant, and is, on farmhouses occupied by a 
tenant or servant, and on houses in which articles are exposed for sale, 
6d. in the pound — on private dwelling houses, 9^. in the pound. 

The parish rates (except sewer rates) are all paid by the tenant. 

Notice to quit should be given in writing, to save possible blunders, 
though verbal notice is sufficient, if there is a witness to prove that it was 
given, and that it was sufficiently explained. 

The following is the form for giving notice to quit : — 

Sir, — I hereby give you notice that I shall quit the house (or apart- 
ments) which I hold of you in street (at the rent of £ per ), 

on day of 18 — . Your obedient Servant, 

Address to landlord by his name and abode. 



To Purchase a House. 



The incoming tenant of a house should be careful, before he takes pos- 
session, to ascertain whether the arrears of rent, ground-rent, taxes, and 
rates have been paid. He should also be certain when he pays the out- 
going tenant for any fixtures, that they are not the property of the landlord. 

The state of repair of the house should be carefully ascertained. All 
broken panes of glass should be repaired ; or, if cracked, a note should be 
taken of the fact, otherwise they will be charged to the tenant on giving 
up possession. Symptoms of damp should be observed It may be 
detected by stains on the wall-papers or whitewash. 

He should also see that the sash-lines of the windows are not worn, 
and that bolts, locks, shutters, etc., are in good order ; that the bells ring ; 
that the floors are level (for if they are not the edges of the planks will de- 
stroy the carpets), and that there are no gaps between the boards, nor round 
the skirting-boards. If Venetian blinds are left in the house, they should be 
carefully examined before purchasing them. He should try if the water- 
taps are right, and ascertain whether the water is on the main, or only 
let in at certain hours of the day ; whether the cisterns are indoors or 
out, and of what materials they are made. A leaden tank or cistern is 
dangerous ; it should be lined with slate, and covered to keep dust and 
bad smells from the water. An out-door tank is likely to get frozen in 
winter, and when it thaws a bursting of pipes is to be apprehended. 

In short, no pains should be spared to ascertain that the house is as 
perfect as may reasonably be expected before entering on its tenancy. 

TO PURCHASE A HOUSE. 

Purchased houses are either freehold, leasehold, or copyhold. Of 
these, a freehold is greatly to be preferred. It becomes, by purchase, the 
property of the purchaser for his life, with power to will it away at his 
death. Any improvements made by him on it increase the value of his 
possession, and are not only for temporary enjoyment, but become actual 
investments. 

A leasehold, on the contrary, can only be bought for a fixed period of 
time, longer or shorter, and at the end of that time reverts to the original 
owner or lessor. Long leases falling in, after the property by improve- 
ments of tenants or other causes has grown valuable, frequently enrich 
the descendants or heirs of the lessors. 

Copyholds are held by lives being placed on them. For example: — 

Three lives may be put on the house ; if all three fall in, the lease 
lapses to the lord of the manor, and is lost to the lessee. Consequently, 
every life failing by the death of the individual must be replaced to 
preserve the property. The putting in a new life is a very expensive affair. 
It is well, therefore, to insure the life placed on it in case of accidental 
mortality ; young and healthy lives should also be chosen for this purpose. 
But this kind of house property must be looked on as a bad investment. 

With all these objections, there may yet be good reasons at times for 
purchasing a leasehold house. If the lease be for 70, 80, or 99 years, and 
to be had cheaply by the payment of a moderate ground-rent, the present 
outlay may be compensated by the house costing less yearly than the 
purchase of a freehold would involve. All leases with uncertain fine? 
should be avoided. A short lease seldom pays, 



jo To Purchase a House. 



The title-deeds of a house should be carefully examined before it is 
purchased ; indeed, no one should buy a house without employing a 
lawyer to look at them first. 

The expenses of conveyance must be calculated as forming an item in 
the outlay for purchasing a house. They are much greater for freeholds 
than for leaseholds. 

All fixtures put up in a leasehold house belong to the lessor or original 
owner, and cannot be taken away at the expiration of the lease, unless 
otherwise specified. No fixture in the soil, out-house, or fold-yard can be 
taken away ; no wainscot, doors, floors, etc., can be removed ; but a tenant 
may remove any conveniences fixed up for the purposes of his own trade, 
as counters, engines, brewing utensils, etc. ; the removal taking place 
before the expiration of his lease. 

Chimney-pieces, pier and other glasses, cupboards, bookcases fitted in 
recesses or against the wall, and wainscot (if it is not nailed but put up 
with screws) may be removed. 

An outgoing lessee must be careful to leave the house in good repair, 
as he is otherwise exposed to an action for dilapidations, which might 
cause him great expense and trouble. 

Before purchasing a house it is well to have it carefully examined by 
a surveyor, in order to ascertain that the walls are thoroughly waterproof, 
that the roof is in good repair, and the drainage perfect ; also that the 
roof shall not be one which will retain snow, or compel the sweeping it 
away with difficulty. An exit to the roof is desirable for this purpose, as 
well as for an escape in case of fire. 

The chimneys should be tested, in order to ascertain whether they 
smoke or not ; indications of this miserable defect may be seen in the 
nouse, unless it has been painted and papered since its last tenant left. 

" A dark house is always an ill-aired house, always a dirty house," says 
Miss Nightingale, in her invaluable " Notes on Nursing ;" "want of light 
stops growth, and promotes scrofula, rickets, &c, among the children. 
People lose their health in a dark house, and if they get ill they cannot 

get well again in it One of the greatest observers of human 

things (not physiological) says, in another language, ' Where there is sun 
there is thought.' All physiology goes to confirm this. Where is the 
shady side of deep valleys, there is cretinism. Where are cellars and the 
unsunned sides of narrow streets, there is the degeneracy and weakliness 
of the human race — mind and body equally degenerating. Put the pale 
withering plant and human being into the sun, and, if not too far gone, 

each will recover health and spirit People think the effect of 

sunshine is upon the spirits only. This is by no means the case. The 
sun is not only a painter but a sculptor. You admit that he does the 
photograph. Without going into any scientific exposition, we must admit 
that light has quite as real and tangible effects upon the human body, 
liut this is not all. Who has not observed the purifying effect of light, 
and especially of direct sunlight, upon the air of a room ? Here is an 
observation within everybody's experience. Go into a room where the 
shutters are always shut (in a sick room or a bedroom there should never 
be shutters shut), and though the room be uninhabited, though the air has 
never been polluted by the breathing of human beings, you will observe a 
close, musty smell of corrupt air, of air — i.e., unpurified by the effect of the

sun's rays. The mustiness of dark rooms and corners, indeed, is pro- 
verbial." 

The Italians have the following truthful proverb : — 

" Dove non entra il sole 
Entrail Dottore." 

"Where the sun does not enter the doctor does." Dwelling in so cold 
and moist a climate as we do, it would be well if builders were taught this 
truth from the sunny South. It is better, therefore, to choose a house the 
aspect of which is east and west ; most assuredly no one who can possibly 
avoid it should hire or purchase a house with a northern aspect, unless 
the chief sitting-rooms face south and are very open to it. Air through the 
house, and sun-light on three or two sides, are the conditions of health. 

Suppose that the householder, as is sometimes the case, has no 
choice of his dwelling, he may still do something to improve it. Say it has 
damp walls, the following suggestions from that excellent paper The 
Builder, may be followed with advantage : — " Remove the whole of the 
damp plaster down to the surface of brick or stone walls, rake out the 
joints, clean and well wet the surface ; lay on a coat of good Portland 
cement, mixed with one-sixth sand ; be careful to cover every part of the 
brick or stone ; broom or otherwise roughen the surface of the cement while 
soft ; let this stand a few days, to get a hard skin on it, then re-plaster in 
the usual way. It will not do well to finish the inside surface with Port- 
land cement, as condensation will take place on the surface in damp 
weather. If speed in execution be desired, the surface may be finished 
with plaster of Paris, Keene's Parian, or Martin's cement, with the usual 
proportion of sand." 

A wash of boiling oil over paint is also an excellent method of keeping 
out damp. 

Sometimes the dampness proceeds from the spouts being foul, and over- 
flowing, or from a leakage in the inner side of one of them. They should 
be looked to, repaired and cleci7ied out; the latter process is imperative 
occasionally, as birds build in spouts and collect immense quantities of 
rubbish in them ; the water not finding a free passage runs over and 
damps the walls. 

Preparation for Damp Walls. 

Nitric acid, 4 ounces ; sulphuric acid, 4 ounces ; spirits of turpentine, 
3 ounces ; muriatic acid, 3 ounces ; stove sal ammoniac, 1 ounce. Mix 
to a consistency of colouring in 8 pounds of lime with hot water, and 
apply when the wall is least damp with a whitewash brush. 



BUILDING A HOUSE. 

Miss Edgeworth calls proverbs "thewisdom of nations." If herassertion 
?s correct, the said wisdom has decided strongly against building a house 
for one's own habitation * Nevertheless, there are people who, looking at 



* Proverb: — " Foels build houses for wise men to live in.' 



1 2 Lodgings. 



the present rapid and certainly very imperfect development of houses 
which are built " to let," feel inclined to try what they can do to secure 
for themselves a well-built dwelling, which will not be in a chronic state 
of disrepair. There is something to be said on their side ; but when such 
a resolution is taken, and outlay is not a matter of consideration, we 
recommend the amateur builder not to be his own architect, but to employ 
a good practical professional architect, who will listen to any suggestions 
he may care to make, and be willing to carry out his plans if they are 
judicious. A good and respectable builder is then necessary. It is better 
to contract for the building with him, at a fixed price and specified time, 
as no amateur builder ever yet calculated exactly the expense of bricks 
and mortar, and many men have been ruined by over-building them- 
selves. 

The architect will submit a plan of the house, which should be carefully 
studied before it is accepted ; and great consideration should be given sic 
to the facilities for draining, the admission of sunshine into the rooms, 
and the proper ventilation. While the house is building, the future owner 
should keep an eye on the building to see that the bricks are new and 
water-tight, that the foundation is deep enough, that the drainage-fall is 
sufficient, and that the pipes and syphons of drains are well cemented 
together. The want of cement in drain-pipes often causes an escape of 
noxious air from them, or, should it occur in the gas-pipes, of gas. He 
should also see that the woodwork is well done. The respectability of 
the builder employed will guarantee that the wood is well-seasoned — 
unseasoned wood will crack and shrink and be a perpetual annoyance 
and trouble if it is used for skirting-boards, doors, etc. etc. The floors 
should also be looked to : if the planks are not laid evenly and smoothly 
the edges will cut the carpets out ; if they are not well fastened down 
also, they will create unpleasantness. The proprietor should also take 
care that the staircase is well lighted, as nothing is more disagreeable 
than dark stairs. 

For persons of small property there are Building Societies, which furnish 
the means of purchasing or building a house by weekly instalments of 
payment or yearly subscription, and also are useful as modes of invest- 
ment for small weekly sums. 

LODGINGS. 

Furnished lodgings are generally hired by the week ; unfurnished, by 
the year or quarter. Payments are made according to arrangements 
between the householder and lodger. 

One of the greatest objections to living in lodgings has been removed 
by the recent Act to protect lodgers' goods. Formerly, if the householder 
did not pay his rent to the superior landlord, the lodger's goods could be 
seized for it. The new Act remedies this injustice. By it a lodger, if a 
distress is levied, is to make a declaration that the immediate tenant has 
no property in the goods distrained. Annexed to the declaration is to be 
a correct inventory, and if the lodger shall subscribe the declaration or 
inventory knowing either of them to be untrue in any material particular, 
he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour. If after such declaration 
and inventory, and after the lodger has paid or tendered the rent, if any

due, the superior landlord shall levy a distress, he shall be deemed guilty 
of an illegal distress, and the lodger may apply to a police-court for an 
order for the restoration of such goods ; besides which, the superior land- 
lord is to be liable to an action at the suit of the lodger, in which action 
the truth of the declaration and inventory may likewise be inquired into. 
The Act is not to extend to Scotland. 

Papering and Painting the House. 

Papering a house is a subject for great consideration before furnishing 
it. Very generally the landlord of a dwelling-house allows the incoming 
tenant to select his own papers at a fixed price. If the tenant wishes for 
a more expensive paper he can have it, of course, by paying the extra 
expense. 

In selecting the paper-hangings, judgment and taste are necessary. 

We should always recollect that wall papers are the same (or ought to 
be) as the background to a picture. They should not therefore be such 
as will attract attention to themselves especially ; they should be subdued 
in effect, with no strong contrasts of colour, or of shades of dark and light. 
Nothing should disturb the sense of flatness on the wall. The tints should 
be simple, the objects represented on it should be conventionally^/. 

While the decorative details should be arranged on symmetrical bases, 
these should be so resolved into the minor forms as not to be obtrusive. 
Prominent colours should be broken over the whole surface, so as to give 
a general negative hue. There should be no masses of prominent colour. 

If the householder already possesses furniture, regard must be had in 
selecting the papers, to the harmony of their colours and style with those 
of his furniture, carpets, and curtains. 

The effect of colour in producing beauty is not half understood by 
people in general. An apartment in which the harmony of colour is 
perfect, although the furniture in other respects may be of very moderate 
goodness, will far surpass in effect a gorgeously or handsomely furnished 
room in which the effect of the mighty enchanter COLOUR has been set at 
nought. A right blending or harmonizing of hues, or judicious contrasts, 
can only be attained, however, by some artistic knowledge, or by that 
instinctive taste possessed by some persons. A few words on colour may 
not be unwelcome to our readers, while on this subject. 

There are generally said to be three primary colours — red, blue, and 
yellow. Any two of these mixed will form 
a secondary colour ; for example, red and primary. 

yellow combined give orange ; yellow and 
blue, green ; blue and red make purple. 
Each primary colour has its complemen- 
tary colour in the other two mixed toge- 
ther. Thus, for the primary RED, yellow 
and blue combined furnish the comple- 
mentary colour green ; in blue and 
red, which produce purple, we have the bi 
complementary of yellow. In the 
union of red and yellow making orange 
colour, we have the complementary of blue. Of course it is clear that

the complementary colour of the secondary or mixed colours must be the 
primaries themselves.

In practice, therefore, we are sure of harmony of tint between blue 
and orange, purple and yellow, green and red. 

The secondary colours form by their union the tertiary colours, which 
are greys — sometimes distinguished as russet — citrine, and olive. These 
also have their complementary colours ; a red grey will be complementary 
to a green, a blue grey to an orange, a yellow grey to purple. 

Colours are modified by mutual neighbourhood, some becoming dulled, 
some more resplendent by the reaction on themselves of the colours next 
to which they are seen. This fact was long known, but the law which con- 
trolled them was discovered by M. Chevreul, director of the Gobelins 
tapestry manufactory. 

He asserted that the phenomena of colour contrast fell under two 
classes — the contrast of colours simultaneously seen, and the successive 
contrast of colours seen one after the other in time. It is to the former 
class that the most important questions regarding domestic art belong, 
and the law which governs this class of contrasts is simply this — t/uJ 
when the eye sees at the same time two colours which are in near neigh- 
bourhood, they will appear as dissimilar as possible. 

Chevreul asserts that there are six distinct modes in which colour 
harmony may address itself to our minds, and that these may be classed 
under two heads — the harmony of analogous colours, and the harmony of 
contrasts. Under the harmonies of analogy he classes 

First Kind. 

Harmonies of Analogous Colours, 

1. The harmony of scale, produced by the simultaneous view of different 
tones* of a second scale, more or less approximating. 

2. The harmony of hues, \ produced by the simultaneous view of tones 
of the same height or nearly so, belonging to scales more or less approxi- 
mating. 

3. The harmony of a dominant coloured light, produced by the simul- 
taneous view of different colours assorted conformably to the laws of 

* Pure tints modified by black or white. 
T Hues are formed by the modification of any pure colour by small amounts 
of some other colour.

contrast, but one of them predominating, as would result from seeing these 
colours through a slightly stained glass. 

Second Kind. 
Harmonies of Contrasts. 

1. The harmony of contrast of scale, produced by the simultaneous 
view of two tones of the same scale, very distant from each other. 

2. The harmony of contrast of hues, produced by the simultaneous 
view of tones of different height, each belonging to contiguous scales. 

3. The harmony of contrast of colours, produced by the simultaneous 
view of colours belonging to scales very far asunder, assorted according to 
the law of contrast : the difference in height of juxtaposed tones may also 
augment the contrast of colours. 

Chevreul names blue and orange as good contrasts ; violet and yellow, 
red, with white or black, in juxtaposition. 

Colours placed in juxtaposition effect a modification in tint or hue on 
each other. Place blue and green of nearly the same height of tone side 
by side, and you will perceive that the blue will look less greenish and be- 
come more violet, and the green will take an orange tinge. 

" Under similar conditions an orange and a red mutually affect each 
other, and pass respectively towards yellow and crimson. Even two 
white stripes by the side of two black, or even two grey stripes matched 
with two brown ones, undergo severally, and severally induce, a change, the 
tone of the grey or the brilliancy of the white being heightened, those of 
the brown and of the black being in a corresponding degree lowered by 
the mutual neighbourhood of these different stripes. It is then a phenome- 
non affecting tone (i. e., relative depth of greyness) as well as tint (*. e., 
relative quality of colour). Furthermore, black, white, or grey, placed in 
juxtaposition with coloured stripes, exhibit changes, the character of which 
can be readily anticipated by reference to Chevreul's law. Thus white 
with red mutually produce difference both in tone and tint. The high 
tone of white (absolute whiteness being the greatest height of tone to 
which all colour can approximate) reacts on the tone of the red lowering it. 
The colour of the red reacts on the colourlessness of the white, impressing 
this with a slight tint of the colour most different from the red — that is to 
say, the complementary colour to the red, namely, green. Thus red and 
white become respectively a deeper toned (darker) red contrasted with a 
slightly greenish white. Thus, too, black and red become a very faintly 
greenish and much less rich black and a more white (lower toned, paler) 
red. The hue variations become marvellously distinct in a well-chosen 
grey whose tone is commensurate with that of the colour juxtaposed to it. 
Here, the modification of tone not affecting the relative brilliancy of the 
colour and the grey, the former impresses on the latter its complementary 
tint, so that a red will render a like-toned grey quite perceptibly green, 
itself becoming of a purer redness, while a blue similarly brightened will 
impart to it a decided orange. Greys slightly tinted with any colour have 
that colour in a surprising way intensified by juxtaposition with its comple- 
mentary, so that a bluish grey will become almost a decided blue in the 
neighbourhood of orange."*

1 6 Papering and Painting the House. 

These hints on the art of colour may be (if carefully thought out) of 
some service to the housewife furnishing. She should see that the stuff 
which covers the cushions of her rosewood chairs is of a colour adapted 
to set off the wood ; and then be careful that this colour is in harmony 
(whether by contrast or judicious analogy of hue) with the wall-paper, the 
curtains, and the carpet ; and that the various hues and tones of these 
are borne out by tints and hues on cornice and wainscot which will har- 
monize with the whole, giving an effect of a blooming light to the room, 
which has a peculiar, and to the uninitiated in art a mysterious charm of 
its own. 

The greys will be found of great service contrasted with their comple- 
mentary colours, and shades of the same colour are also pleasant to the 
eye. In papering, forethought regarding the furniture to be placed in the 
room must constantly be exercised. The bloomy papers, all of one tint, 
with gold mouldings or panellings always look well, if the colour be chosen 
with regard to that of the carpet, curtains, and general style of furniture. 
But fashion regulates the style of papers, with or without the "dado." 

We have insisted elsewhere in this volume on the beneficial effect of 
LIGHT. Colour has been said by one of the wisest and most practical of 
Englishwomen to be, like light, a physical boon as well as a thing of 
beauty. 

" The effect in sickness of beautiful objects, of variety of objects, and 
especially of brilliancy of colour," says Miss Nightingale, " is hardly at all 
appreciated. 

" Such cravings are usually called the ' fancies' of patients. And often 
doubtless patients have 'fancies/ as, e.g., when they desire two contradic- 
tions. But much more often, their (so called) 'fancies' are the most 
valuable indications of what is necessary for their recovery. And it would 
be well if nurses would watch these (so called) ' fancies' closely. 

" I have seen, in fevers (and felt, when I was a fever patient myself) the 
most acute suffering produced from the patient (in a hut) not being able to 
see out of window, and the knots in the wood being the only view. I shall 
never forget the rapture of fever patients over a bunch of bright-coloured 
flowers. I remember (in my own case) a nosegay of wild flowers being 
sent me, and from that moment recovery becoming more rapid. 

" People say the effect is only on the mind. It is no such thing. The 
effect is on the body, too. Little as we know about the way in which we 
are affected by form, by colour, and light, we do know this, that they have 
an actual physical effect. 

" Variety of form and brilliancy of colour in the objects presented to 
patients are actual means of recovery."* 

If colour and beautiful objects have this effect on the sick, how can we 
doubt but that a beautiful room, bright, or soothing from the effect of 
colour, will have a good and wholesome effect on those who are in health. 

How much of ill-humour, depression, and craving for excitement may 
be caused by a dull, dark room, without a ray of beauty in the shape of 
colour or fonn to enlighten it. 

Let your walls then be painted or papered with harmonious colours ; or 
if, unluckily, you have no choice, and the dull, heavy, drab paper, or one of 

* Miss Nightingale's "Notes on Nursing." 



Papering — Painting — Colour. x 7 



violent and vulgar colouring disfigures the room, try to enliven it or to 
tone it down, as required, by your curtains and furniture, or by bright water- 
colour drawings for the first, or engravings with dark or oak frames for 
the other. Though, really, a pretty paper may be had cheaply enough, and 
the expense is as nothing compared with the benefit conferred by it. But 
of some delicate attractive tints it is necessary to beware. The apple- 
green papers are coloured by means of arsenic, which is likely to fly off 
into the air of the room and slowly poison its inmates. The writer 
remembers that, as a child, she was always conscious of a feeling of dis- 
comfort and sleeplessness in a green bedroom ; and that she was said to be 
fanciful and too imaginative, from the intense dislike she took in conse- 
quence of this feeling to green rooms. Science has since become popu- 
larized, and her childish distaste is proved to have had a very real and serious 
cause. A personal friend of hers will never again be quite strong from 
having slept for a long time in a bedroom papered with green. A suspicion 
of the truth having been roused by our discussing the question of papers, 
the one covering her bedroom wall was tested, and the doctor declared 
her singular illness was actually slow arsenical poisoning from the particles 
which floated on the air from the paper. Another friend of ours — a gifted 
artist — once suffered from almost a fit, caused by the same thing. For- 
tunately he only passed one night in the fatal chamber, the paper of which 
was pulled down by order of his hostess the next day. 

With regard to health, Miss Nightingale says, "As for walls, the worst 
is the papered wall ; the next worst is plaster. But the plaster can be 
redeemed by frequent lime- washing ; the paper requires frequent renewing. 
A glazed paper gets rid of a good deal of the danger. But the ordinary 
bedroom paper is all that it ought ?iot to be. 

" The close connexion between ventilation and cleanliness is shown in 
this. An ordinary light paper will last clean much longer if there is an 
Arnott's ventilator in the chimney than it otherwise would. 

" The best wall now extant is oil painted. From this you can wash the 
animal exuviae." 

Bedroom papers should be light, they should not be of patterns which 
tempt the gazer on them to count them. I mean that alternate rows of 
bunches of flowers or fanciful shapes in very regular order, should be 
avoided. The sleeper awakened should not have rows of figures on the 
wall which tempt him to count six, seven, twelve, thirteen, as we are all 
conscious of having done. This is very disturbing, and as it is 
always possible that an invalid may occupy the bedroom, it is to be 
avoided. 

Next as to warmth or coolness of colour. 

Dark colours are wanner than light ones, because they absorb heat 
from the sun more than light ones do. This can be proved by experiment, 
and is indeed instinctively acknowledged by us all. Red is a warm colour. 
White gives coolness. We give the order of degrees in which the colours 
stand as regards heat. 



1. Black— warmest of all. 

2. Violet. 

3. Indigo. 

4. Blue. 



5. Green. 

6. Red. 

7. Yellow. 

8. White. 



1 8 Papering — Painting — Colour. 

Now the rooms in our houses have, of course, different aspects, varying 
as to heat. A northern aspect never gets much sunlight, or all it does get 
is very early morning sunshine in the heat of summer. To live in rooms 
or a house which has o?ily a northern aspect, or in which the chief rooms 
all look north is a mistake, as we have before said. Nevertheless, we may 
find in some corner of even a sunny house a north room to paper. Let 
us recollect that it will be nearly sunless, and provide a light-radiating 
paper for it. Red is warm. Light red would be bright and cheerful. White 
would be best as to light-giving, but then it looks cold ! Could we not 
choose a paper of the two mixed ? The white ground with bright red 
figuring on it ? In a north room the paper and furniture should be both 
brightly coloured. Blue is also pretty for a north room. 

A warm south room will be the better for a white paper, or one of the grey 
green tint, which is not arsenical. Yellow is a restless colour in which the 
eye feels a want of repose. Yet amber — one of its shades — is very effec- 
tive in a drawing-room facing north. 

Let our readers remember that papers on walls retain a great deal 
of the dust which passes over them, and require dusting as much nearly 
as furniture does. They also retain infection ; after scarlet fever or small- 
pox the walls of the sick chamber should be repapered, and the paint and 
whitewash of the ceiling re-done. Be careful also, that when your rooms 
are papered the old paper is first removed — this is essential to perfect puri- 
fication of the apartment. 

The paint in a house should harmonize with the paper and the furni- 
ture. With a pale grey-green paper, the doors and skirting boards should 
be painted pale green. With paper of a rosy hue, pale strawberry colour ; 
or the finer maple-wood should be imitated in a drawing-room. Panels 
picked out in gold, and gilt mouldings, are great improvements, and where 
expense is no object, tinting the moulding of the ceiling is very desirable ; 
soft shades, light and dark, of grey are very effective, and tints of colour 
blended with them are often beautiful. 

Dining-rooms are better painted than papered. Fashion assigns them 
at present darker paper than the other rooms. In London, and for north 
rooms, this is a mistake, as it occasions a diminution of size to the eye, 
and a gloom and deficiency of light. If painted, a light colour would of 
course be employed, and this alone is an advantage ; not to speak of the 
avoidance of fumes of dinner, which hang about a wall paper. We have 
two charming dining-rooms at this moment in our " mind's eye " — one 
painted pale green, with curtains of the same hue, but of a darker tint — 
the ceiling picked out in green grey and pale greens ; another of a tint 
of indescribable salmon colour, with a crimson carpet, and curtains of a 
darker hue, yet retaining a due harmony of tint.* 

To get rid of a Bad Smell in a Room newly Painted. 

Place a vessel full of lighted charcoal in the middle of the room, and 
throw on it two or three handfuls of juniper berries, shut the windows, the 

* For ordinary hired houses, paper alone is attainable, and a little judgment 
and knowledge of colour and its effects will help to render the dining-room plea- 
sant and cheerful at a much lower rate of outlay.

chimney, and the door closely ; twenty-four hours afterwards the room may 
be opened, when it will be found that the sickly unwholesome smell will 
be entirely gone. The smoke of the juniper berry possesses this advantage, 
that should anything be left in the room, such as tapestry, etc., none of it 
will be spoiled. 

FURNISHING. 

A house painted and papered with taste has next to be furnished with 
taste* 

Where the means are large and the taste good, this may be easily 
achieved ; but it by no means follows that expensive furnishing is tasteful 
furnishing. Good taste may be shown at very small expense, and bad 
taste at a great cost ; but where the taste is equal, the means will largely 
assist the furnisher in making her dwelling beautiful. 

The great improvement in art during the last twenty years has enabled 
us to obtain articles of exceeding elegance and beauty, and it is only 
necessary to have a just and pure taste to be able to delight the eyes and 
charm the mind in a modern home. 

Where a purchaser -is doubtful of her taste or knowledge in furnishing a 
mansion, it is wise for her to trust to those of a very first-class upholsterer, 
but it is pleasanter every way to be able to choose for oneself, and a Utile 
knowledge of colours, and study of works of art will soon improve an 
uncultivated taste. Bad taste is shown in a jumble of many gaudy tints — 
too much gilding — too many mirrors — an overcrowding of furniture- 
furniture of size disproportionate to that of the room — an air of stiffness 
and unoccupancy. No expenditure can atone for any of these defects. 

THE ENTRANCE-HALL. 

The hall may, in the country, rejoice in sylvan trophies of the chase — 
antlers — the fox's head and brush ; — old carved oak cabinets may fill in 
recesses, and within them may repose a collector's treasures. The carved 
oak chairs and table, the umbrella-stands like them in material ; the 
blazing open grate in winter, the same full of bunches of evergreens or 
large pots of hydrangea or azalea in summer, frequently renewed, may 
make it a pleasant place to linger in. In London there is a conventional 
type of table, seats, stands, etc., which must necessarily be followed, chiefly 
for want of space. 

Carpets. 

The carpet of a room should have a quiet and negative effect, giving an 
impression of flatness; there should be no strong contrasts of light or 
shade in it. The leading forms should be composed so as to distribute 
the pattern over the whole floor, not up and down the breadths. The 
forms should he flat, without shadow or relief, whether derived from orna- 
ments, flowers, or foliage. The ground should be of a negative colour, 
generally low in tone, and inclined to the tertiary hues — i.e., the greys. 

* Furniture may be hired for twenty per cent, on its value if quite new ; for 
example, if furniture, which to purchase would cost 150/., is hired, you would 
pay 30/. a year for the hire. Secondhand furniture is let at ten per cent.

20 Carpets. 

distinguished as russet, citrine, and olive ; — leading forms of the pattern 
should be expressed by the secondary colours, purple, green, and orange 
—primary colours should be seen in small quantities. Such, according 
to the principles of true taste, should be a carpet ; and the nearer we get 
to these suggestions the better the style of our rooms will be, but at 
present few carpets accord with these rules, and we are compelled to make 
the best choice that we can from those to be had. 

Let us now see what are the different kinds of carpets, that we may 
judge of the value and expense of these necessary articles of English 
household furnishing. 

Turkey and Persian carpets have a cut surface of wool, and are 
always made in oblong squares, with a border round them. They are suited 
for dining rooms, being warm to the feet, and bearing much wear and 
tear. Their colours are generally a rich and fanciful pattern of red, blue, 
and green, or yellow. When much worn, Turkey carpets may be shorn 
carefully, and will then be as good as new ; they are expensive. Our 
Axminster carpet is an imitation of the Turkey, but surpasses it in 
value and richness. The pile is thick, and the colours brilliant. This 
carpet also is very expensive. The Wilton and velvet pile carpets 
have a velvety surface, resembling that of the Turkey carpet, but they are 
liner and thinner, and the pile will not clip. They soon grow dirty, and 
look bad. BRUSSELS carpets are woven on a foundation of flax thread, but 
their pile is not cut as the Wilton is. They are called three-thread when 
each loop consists of three woollen threads, and two-thread when the 
loop consists of two only. These last carpets are cheaper, but do not 
wear well. An old Brussels carpet worn quite bare to the foundation will 
sell well, as it is then used for making oil-cloth on. 

Tapestry carpets are woven like Brussels, of woollen threads, but they 
are dyed in short lengths, or now, we believe, stamped with colours. 
Their colours are much more brilliant than the Brussels, but they do not 
last well, and are not cheaper in the end, though they cost less at the 
moment of buying. Nevertheless, for a room not much occupied, they 
answer extremely well. 

Kidderminster and Scotch carpets are woven all of wool, and have 
two sides, so that they can be turned, but they are of no substance, and 
soon wear and cut out. They do for bedrooms pretty well, but will not 
stand much wear. 

Dutch carpets are made on the same principle, but have a woof of 
flax — consequently they wear better. 

Venetian carpet has a woof of flax, and a web of woollen threads, 
which shows on both sides. It is only used for strips by the bedside, or 
for stair-carpets. 

Drugget is a coarse kind of woollen carpeting woven like flannel, 
which wears pretty well as a common carpet, but is chiefly used for cover- 
ing better carpets. It is printed. 

Felt is wool of a short staple matted together, not woven. It is 
printed, often very prettily, and catches the eye, but wears very badly 
indeed, the colours rub off, and it is soon useless. 

Cocoa-nut matting is very durable and cheap. It is used for offices, 
halls, and kitchens, and is of all widths. 

India Matting is made from grasses, and is used for covering carpets

in bedrooms and dressing-rooms on spots where the wear is very great — ■ 
i.e., before the toilet-table, washing-stand, etc. 

Floor-cloth. — The foundation of this cloth is either of flax, or else 
the foundation of an old Brussels carpet — part flax, part wool. A strong 
oil-paint is laid smoothly over it in four coats, and the pattern is stamped 
on it. They are sold by the square yard. 

Oil-cloths are also a painted material, but on much finer and thinner 
canvas. The oil-paint finer, and pattern more delicate. They are used 
for table-covers ; but we object to them, as they destroy the varnish op 
French polish, under them. They are also used as squares under hip- 
baths to save the carpet from wet. 

Hearth-rugs are made like Axminster carpets, with a foundation of 
flax, into which tufts of wool are woven, and then cut. 

Door-mats are of the like make, unless they are of skins tanned and 
dried. Hemp door-mats are used for the outer-door, as best suited to 
take off mud and dust. 

We must say a word here about the rag-carpets manufactured by 
our American cousins. They are thus made : — 

Old cloth clothes, as coats, cloaks, etc., are torn into narrow strips ; 
these are joined into one length, and are rolled up in balls. They form 
the warp ; coarse coloured yarn makes the woof. It is sent to a weaver 
and woven. These carpets are comparatively inexpensive, and last long ; 
but as we have never seen them, we know nothing about their appear- 
ance. 

Good rugs for bedrooms maybe manufactured at home, by cutting pieces 
of list from flannel into short lengths and knitting them into a twine 
foundation. First knit a number of stitches, sufficient for the width you 
require ; on the third row begin to knit in, with every stitch, a piece of 
narrow and short list. Make it the desired length, line it with any piece 
of old carpet or drugget to keep it firm. Short pieces of red flannel might 
be knitted in about four stitches deep at each end of the row if a border 
be desired. But then the four first rows, and four last, must be of red 
flannel instead of list. This makes a cheap and comfortable rug. 

Carpets are generally made up by the upholsterer, at a charge of three- 
pence on the yard. This includes binding, but the tape will be extra. 

A clever woman can make a carpet perfectly well. The great secret is 
for the patterns to match down each breadth, a little puckering and some 
contrivance will easily achieve this, and there will be less waste than if an 
upholsterer's people did it — as they have not patience to contrive and 
arrange it as it may be done. The moss patterns, which are, after all, the 
very prettiest and most picturesque of carpets, save the waste of this 
pattern-matching which, unless care and skill are shown, is excessive. 
If coarse paper, used for the purpose, is laid over the floor under 
the carpet, it will last much longer and feel much softer to the tread. 
Caipets are laid down by means of a stretcher, hammer, and tacks. 
The first thing to be done in laying down a carpet is to clear the 
room of furniture, and place the carpet as it is meant to go. Then 
begin at one corner, and nail down one side of the cut ends of the 
breadths, not the selvage way. Continue nailing down by the selvage 
side. The carpet is stretched carefully, so as to be neither too loose 
nor too much strained. If you are nailing it down yourself, and you have 



22 The Dining-room. — The Drawing-room. 

no stretcher, get some one to help you. Let him stretch the carpet with 
all his strength while you nail it down. When two sides are nailed down, 
nail the side opposite to the selvage ; and lastly, the fourth side (of cut 
ends of breadths). Here the greatest stretching is required to get rid of 
puckers. 

A carpet must be well laid down, or it will not wear well ; it is best, if 
it can be afforded, to have it done by experienced people. 

THE DINING-ROOM 

Should look warm in winter, and cool in summer. The carpet should be 
a rich Turkey or Axminster — not quite covering the floor, but leaving a 
border of polished oak. The sideboard should be (in the country) of old 
oak carved, all the furniture matching it ; in London, of polished maho- 
gany, the cellaret to match. The dining-table should be oval, of polished 
mahogany ; the chairs of the same, with leather cushions, harmonizing in 
colour with the curtains. The side-tables should not be too large ; the 
chimney-ornaments of bronze ; on the walls, family portraits, or well- 
chosen landscapes — not paintings of any painful subject. 

The colour of the dining-room should be bright and rich, suiting the 
aspect, but we may suggest that green (of a grey tint, not arsenical green) 
is a good colour, as it is warm-looking in winter and has the effect oi 
looking cool in the summer. It harmonizes also with the rich colours of the 
carpet. The walls should not be papered, but painted delicate green and 
varnished — the cornice picked out with tints of green and soft greys. The 
curtains should be of rep or damask, the leather of the chairs of the 
same colour ; or, of a perfect interval of shade between them and the wall. 

Dinner Table Ornaments. 

The dinners a la Russe exact more splendid ornaments for the dinner- 
table than were formerly required. The Exhibition of 1878 has furnished 
several specimens of beautiful dinner-table decorations. 

About one of the prettiest is the looking-glass plateau with the scented 
fountain, represented in the plate. Of course, the difficulty of drawing it 
has been great, but it will be understood that the vases of flowers standing 
on it, the perfumed water, and the fruits and creams are all reflected in 
the looking-glass, which will also shine and glitter in the gas-light above. 
The rim, filled with sand, holds flowers. Nothing can be prettier than 
this for a Russian dinner ; we think, even the splendour of a silver 
plateau cannot surpass its effect. 

These dinner ornaments may fairly be classed, we think, with furniture, 
although they are, of course, only used at dinner-time. 

THE DRAWING-ROOM 

Might have a light-coloured paper and paint picked out with gold, and 
the cornice and ceiling the same, with soft shades of grey. The furni- 
ture may then be of any hue chosen. Amber is very elegant; peach- 
bloom delicate ; or pale green. Blue is also pretty, but the instructions 
given as to colour must be remembered in every case. Chintz, and under 
muslin curtains, are pretty for summer. The furniture might be somewhat 
as follows : — ■ 



The Library. — The Schoolroom. 23 



List of Furniture for Drawing-room. 

Brussels carpet or velvet pile, hearth-rug to match, or fender-st.ool of 
worsted work — fender and fireirons. 

In summer, a looking-glass chimney-board, upper portion perforated 
to let air in ; a rustic screen where fender would be, and hot-house plants 
in it on a raised stand, or velvet curtains trimmed with lace. 

Loo-table. Pembroke-table. 

Small tables, marble tops, for vases of flowers. Five o'clock tea-table. 

Chess table. Ladies' work-table. 

Console tables and mirrors. 

Davenport ; or fancy writing-table, furnished with inkstand, penstand, 
blotting-book, letter-weigher, taper, pen-wiper, china saucer, with seals, 
wax, etc. etc. Grand piano. 

Two large china vases for flowers. 

Brackets for old china and statuettes. 

Chimneypiece, pier glass, handsome clock, lustres, china vases and 
figures. 

Sofa, ottoman centre, occasional table for tea, footstools, prie-dieu 
chair. 

The sofa, chairs, and ottoman should be of the same coloured satin as 
the curtains, covered, in summer, with chintz. 

Fire-screens, banner-screens, knick-knacks on tables, etc. etc. 

The wall pictures may be left to the owner's taste. 

Above all, the room should have an air of comfort and occupancy. 
Books lying about here and there — not the magnificent volumes of 
engravings, etc. which lie on the loo-tables, but readable books and 
periodicals — a lady's open workbox — chairs moved from their places, give 
the home-like air which has so great a charm for the casual visitor 

THE LIBRARY 

Should have a rich Turkey carpet, and the furniture should be of a 
handsome and stately character, of carved oak or rosewood. Above the 
bookshelves should be busts of distinguished authors, and in the intervals 
between them Mercuries (or tall stands) with the same. Over the mantel- 
piece a good picture ; on the chimney-piece itself a marble or bronze 
timepiece ; bronze ornaments ; a centre table, two writing tables with 
small drawers, duly fitted up with inkstand, pens, blotting-books, tapers, 
letter-weighers, paper weights ; a Postal Directory on one, a Peerage on 
the other, a barrel of string, large scissors, paper-knives, penknives ; 
globes and maps between the bookshelves ; a portfolio, stand for 
choice engravings ; a cabinet for gems of art ; general colouring grave and 
warm. 

THE SCHOOLROOM. 

The schoolroom should, if possible, receive the morning sun, which 
will be found a great enlivener of youthful intellects. It should be a 
nicely furnished room ; the apartment in which early tastes and disposi- 
tions, as well as intellects, are cultivated, should not be dull, cheerless, 
ugly and depressing. Where expense is no object, good pictures and 



24 The Nurseries. — The Bedrooms. 

thoroughly well-furnished bookshelves will be found great adjuncts to 
education ; a terrestrial and celestial globe, an easel or two as required, a 
really good piano, a library-table with drawers, two inkstands and other 
writing materials, slates, a small round work-table, one easy-chair or a 
sofa, and light cane-bottomed chairs for the elder pupils, high-backed 
chairs and low chairs for the little ones are required. Under the book- 
shelves should be cupboards to hold slates, copy and exercise books, and 
drawing materials ; on a stand a portfolio for drawings. Atlases must be 
provided, and a Canterbury for music. 

THE NURSERIES. 

The Nurseiy should face either south or east. It is cruel to condemn 
infants to north rooms, or underground rooms ; both are unhealthy abodes 
for them. Let the mother remember that the future health of her offspring 
depends greatly on the admission of air and light to their apartments. 
Nursery walls should be painted and varnished, that they may be easily 
and often washed down. The floor is best covered with a carpet which 
may be taken up daily in winter ; in summer it is better to have no carpet, 
but a few soft sheep's-wool mats on the floor. No curtains should be 
allowed in summer ; the room should be made to look very pretty, with 
coloured prints on the walls of pleasant and cheerful subjects — appropriate 
emblazoned texts will also charm the little people. Their tastes may be 
judiciously cultivated even in infancy. Low chairs and tables as well as 
high ones, a closet for toys, and a shelf for books are required. 

The night Nursery should be well ventilated, without bed-curtains or 
window-curtains ; strips of carpet by the beds only, and not too many 
persons in the room. There should be high fenders and fire-guards in 
both rooms, and an Etna should be provided for the night nursery, and a 
large clothes-horse for airing clothes. 

THE BEDROOMS. 

A lady's bedroom (where money can be commanded) may be a very 
charming retreat. Bedsteads of great elegance may be purchased, and 
should if possible stand back in an alcove. We have seen them of carved 
ivory, dating from Queen Elizabeth's days : of carved oak, of polished 
mahogany, of very pretty manufactured brass. One very splendid bed- 
stead, of Louis XIVVs time, we have seen, the centre of the top of which 
was lined with looking-glass, surrounded by a painted ivory frame of 
great beauty ; fluted blue satin sloped from it to the sides, and from 
thence fell blue satin curtains trimmed with lace. It was a couch fit for a 
princess. 

The bedstead of modern days is less splendid but far more healthy, 
for curtains are very generally eschewed by the wealthy class of our day, 
and the light but elegant brass bedstead is wisely preferred. The pillows 
are edged with lace, the coverlet an embroidered or Marcella quilt, on it 
a coloured silk duvet. On the pillows an embroidered case, lined with 
same colour, for the night-dress. 

Bedroom carpets should not be fixed to the floor, a margin of polished 
wood may be left round the room, so that the carpet may be taken up 
and beaten frequently. It should not be of a large bright pattern : a soft 



The Bedrooms ', etc. — Housekeeper's Room. 2 $ 

moss carpet, or some general tint of great delicacy, is best. By the side 
of the bed should be a deep white-wool flossy-looking mat for stepping on 
when the lady gets up. A similar rug before the fire in winter, and a small 
one before the toilette-table, are also desirable. Near the washing-stand 
should be spread;a large square of thick soft flannel, nicely bound, for the 
bath to stand on. The toilette service should match the washing-stand 
china, and both should harmonize with the carpet and walls. In some 
houses you will see lace curtains fastened with a crescent to the ceiling 
above the toilette-table, and floating down on each side of it. These are 
used in old families. In former days, at least about a hundred years ago, 
it was usual when a death took place in the family to draw these curtains 
over the looking-glasses and mirrors. In the present day they can be 
drawn to shelter the toilette-table from dust, but their chief use is adorn- 
ment, to which they add greatly. A screen round the washing-stand is 
comfortable and may also be made very ornamental. A cheval glass, 
easy-chairs, a sofa, a table for writing, etc., are necessary. On the latter 
should be placed in every bedroom an inkstand, pens, blotting-paper 
case, and taper. In many houses a Bible stands beside them. 

The curtains of the bedroom should be chintz, we think, both as being 
more lively to the eye and capable of cleaning more perfectly than satin 
or damask. The new material, Cretonne, is also well suited to the purpose. 
A bookcase, fixed to the wall or standing near it, should contain favourite 
books. Pictures in bedchambers are generally of a religious character, 
and wall texts are especially suitable as well as ornamental. One general 
rule may close our hints on a handsome chamber : let everything in it tend 
to soothe and cheer the inmate, and make it a retreat from the noise and 
hurry of daily life. 

The Gentlemen's Dressing-rooms should have the same carpet and 
curtains as the adjoining bedroom ; easy-chair and couch of the same 
chintz as the bedroom furniture ; the dressing-table must not be a toilette ; 
there must be a good-sized marble washing-stand, a bath, boot-jack, etc. ; 



HOUSEKEEPER'S AND LADY'S-MAID'S ROOMS. 

The Housekeeper's Room should be neatly but plainly furnished, and 
should contain large closets, or cupboards, for her use ; writing materials, 
a slate-book and pencil for the dinner carte, and as the individual is often 
alone, it is usual to put a modest sofa or leather easy-chair in her room. 

The Lady's-maid's Room should have a long, large deal table in it for 
cutting out ; a dummy figure, or at least a head for fitting trimmings and 
bonnet making, two flat-irons for pressing dresses, etc. ; an Italian and 
gauffering irons, soft and hard clothes brushes, and a sewing machine. 
In many large houses a room is set apart for the needlework of the family ; 
when this is the case the lady's-maid's room is simply furnished as any 
other bedroom of modest pretensions, and the table, machine, irons, etc., 
are transferred to the workroom.

SERVANTS' HALL AND SERVANTS' BEDROOMS. 

The Servants' Hall has a long, large oak or deal dining-table, and 
forms or benches for sitting at it. 

In many large houses the servants' bedrooms are a disgrace to the 
dwelling; while amongst the middle classes very tidy rooms are provided for 
the domestics. We have seen servants' chambers in great mansions which 
were void of nearly every comfort. Why should not servants have neat 
and even pretty rooms ? It would be one means of civilizing them and 
improving their tastes ; and surely they require baths even more than 
their mistresses do. We wish we could see a bath in every servant's room, 
a toilette-cover on her table, a good text enlivening her wall with gay 
colours and wholesome counsel, and a glass of flowers, or any other cheap 
adornment. If female servants are encouraged to try and make their 
bedrooms pretty, they will take a pride in them and acquire habits and 
tastes which may ultimately improve the home of the working man. In 
addition to neat ordinary furniture, we would give, in the rich man's home, 
a hip-bath, a few bookshelves and books on them, a table and inkstand, 
and a flower-glass or two. 

"I must say a word," observes Miss Nightingale, "about servants' 
bedrooms. From the way they are built, but oftener from the way 
they are kept, and from no intelligent inspection whatever being 
exercised over them, they are almost invariably dens of foul air, and 
the 'servants' health ' suffers in an 'unaccountable' (?) way, even in 
the country. For I am by no means speaking only of London houses, 
where too often servants are put to live under the ground and over 
the roof. But in a country ' mansion} which was really a ' mansion ' (not 
after the fashion of advertisements), I have known three maids who slept 
in the same room ill of scarlet fever. ' How catching it is,' was of course 
the remark. One look at the room, one smell of the room, was quite 
enough. It was no longer ' unaccountable.'" 

WOODS USED IN FURNISHING. 

The woods used in furnishing are — deal, mahogany, rosewood, walnut, 
birch, maple, beech, white and yellow pine, satin-wood, cedar; and oak. 
lime, and pear, which are used for carving. Of these woods, deal is the 
cheapest and rosewood the dearest. 

For bedroom furniture, japanned (or painted) deal is quite good 
enough. It is much cheaper than mahogany or birch, and looks fresher 
than birch after a lapse of years, if it is taken care of and kept clean. 

For people who can afford it, an inferior kind of walnut-wood is very- 
nice in bedrooms. But good mahogany, if it is not too expensive, is 
the best investment, for (with care) time improves it, and it will always, if 
sold, bring nearly its original price. Deal is used for the tables in 
kitchens, etc. 

There are two kinds of mahogany — Spanish and Honduras. Spanish 
is the best ; it is darker in hue, and the grain has a curl or wave in it 
which is considered a beauty, and regulates its price. It has a fine close 
texture, is very hard and strong, and does not break easily, nor does it 



Woods used in Furnishing. 27 

warp or twist. The weight of mahogany is the best test of its value, the 
heaviest being, in general, the best. Sometimes mahogany is veneered 
over cedar or pine — that is, thin slices of the more valuable wood are glued 
on to other wood of less value. The Honduras mahogany has a coarse, 
loose, and straight grain and is not so valuable. Tricks are practised 
occasionally, by which Honduras mahogany is made to look the colour of 
Spanish. It is stained to the colour before it is polished. The same 
deceit is practised on birch, which is thus made to take the appearance of 
mahogany. The young housekeeper, to avoid being thus imposed on, 
should deal with a first-rate firm incapable of dishonesty. Buying cheap 
and showy furniture is a great mistake, as it never lasts, and costs more 
in the end for repairs, or replacement, than good articles would cost at first. 

Rosewood is a dark hard wood, with a slight curl or wave in the grain. 
It is most used in veneers, but the solid wood is sometimes used. 

Walnut, at the present time, rivals rosewood in use for drawing-room 
furniture. It is a very lovely wood, very close grained, compact and hard, 
and it takes a very high polish. 

Birch is an American wood, of a pale yellowish brown, which, when 
polished, has a silky lustre that is very pleasing. By staining, it can be 
made to resemble Honduras mahogany, as we have said. It is much 
cheaper than rosewood or mahogany, and makes pretty chairs, etc. 

Maple, also an American wood, somewhat resembles satinwood, but it 
is much darker, and the grain has more curl. It has knobs in it called 
birds' eye. It is used very much for picture-frames, and is not very 
common in furniture, but the writer possesses a remarkably handsome 
chest of drawers of maple. 

Beech is a close tough wood, much used for the framework of chairs, 
bedsteads, and tables. It is rather paler than birch, and may be known 
by its having on it little specks of darker brown. 

White and yellow pine are much used at present, japanned or painted, 
for bedroom suites, and look very nice, but the stain is apt to fade, and if 
the wood has not been very well seasoned, the furniture is apt to crack 
and fall to pieces. We think honest deal japanned, far preferable to pine. 

Satin-wood is very beautiful for small fancy tables, cabinets, etc. etc., 
or inlaying. It was once fashionable in furniture, and still (we think) 
gives an air of distinction to a room, as its use is not quite of to-day. 

Cedar is of a dark colour, resembling pale mahogany, and has a sweet 
aromatic smell. Chests of drawers made of it, and veneered with maho- 
gany, are very nice, as cedar keeps away moths. 

Oak is either British or foreign ; the latter is known by the name of 
wainscot, and is used for kitchen tables in great houses. British oak is 
darker in colour than wainscot. Oak is used for carved furniture of the 
best and most expensive description. 

Lime is seldom used except for carving. 

Pear resembles pine. 

Cane is split, and makes chair-bottoms for bedrooms. 

Veneered articles of furniture are cheaper, and often lighter to move 
than those made of solid wood. By looking underneath a table, the pur- 
chaser can see if it is veneered or solid. Veneered goods are often pre- 
ferable to solid, not only because they are cheaper, but because there is 
less risk of their splitting or warping. 



;8 Cheap Furnish hi, 



The purchaser of veneered goods should catch the light upon them so 
as to see if the surface is perfectly flat. If it is not so, he should not 
purchase them — any inequalities of surface are caused by the veneering 
being badly done, or the wood underneath not having been seasoned. 

BUHL-WORK consists of woods inlaid with metal (generally lacquered 
or gilt brass), or with ivory, tortoiseshell, etc. etc. 

Marquetry resembles mosaic work, or Tunbridge-work — i.e. a pattern 
is formed by blocks of coloured wood being joined together. Marquetry 
is not so minute as mosaic work. 

Parquetry is a coarse kind of buhl- work used for floors. 

Almost all articles of modern wood furniture are French polished — 
dining-tables are sometimes excepted on account of hot plates, etc. marking 
the surface. 

CHEAP FURNISHING. 

We have now to consider how taste may be blended with economy. 

Of course, the same laws respecting harmony of colour belong to the 
rich and poor alike. Say you have hired an ordinary London house. 
Manage to get permission to choose the papers yourself, and get for ail as 
soft and light a tint as the means placed at your disposal will admit ; but 
recollect that varnished papers are cheapest in the end, as they will clean 
like new with bread. If possible, have the dining-room painted. 

Panelling and imitation wainscoting diminishes the size of a room, 
and consequently is to be eschewed for small rooms. If you have 
furniture, endeavour to harmonize the colour of the wall with it, and with 
your curtains. 

The white and gold drawing-room papers are not very expensive ; for 
about So 1 , or 6d. a yard a tolerably good one can be obtained. 

A drawing-room suite mounted with green rep can be obtained for 
10/. 10s. at most of the upholsterers, and is worth the money, as when the 
seat stuffings sink, they may be re-stuffed by the notable housewife herself. 

The tapestry carpets are very pretty, and will with care last many 
years, though not so long as the Brussels ; as, however, they last very 
fairly with care, they can really be recommended. The moss patterns are 
very suitable to small rooms, and have a charming effect ;— - these carpets are 
about is. M. per yard ; hearth-rugs to match, 17s. 6d. In laying them, the 
floor should first be covered with the coarse brown paper used for the 
purpose ; it not only protects the carpet, but gives a very thick feeling to 
it when trodden on. The suite of furniture will contain a sofa, 2 easy- 
chairs and 6 ordinary chairs. A loo-table may be had cheaply if the top is 
made of deal (which can be covered with the cloth) but care must be taken 
not to get a badly seasoned wood, however cheap, as in time it will open 
across. A second-hand loo table is to be preferred if it can be bought, 
and chintz curtains, with lace curtains under them, are prettiest for a 
drawing-room. A piano, a few vases of flowers, nicely arranged, 
a good clock, a chess-table, a Davenport, a work-table, will be found 
ornaments enough, and we may suggest a book-stand on the table, 
with some choice authors, and a few ornaments on the mantelpiece. 
These few simple articles will furnish a comfortable room, if it be light 
and well ventilated and occupied. But it would appear poor and shabby 



Cheap Furnishing* 29 



if it is kept dark, dusty, or too tidy. Above all, we protest against the 
formal row of books crossed over each other on the table, the shell baskets, 
etc. etc., which disfigure instead of ornamenting a room. Books which are 
readable are a great, almost indispensable addition to a lady's drawing- 
room, but not the collections of poems and old-fashioned hereditary 
volumes which figure on the loo-table solely on account of their binding ; 
nor the trashy novels thrown about it. Taste can be shown inform also. 
Prettily shaped vases ; the disposal of the furniture about the room, even 
the fall of the curtains, will show this precious gift, and alter the whole 
appearance of the apartment Above all, perfect cleanliness and fresh- 
ness, pure air admitted, and plenty of light when possible, give a great 
charm to a room. In winter, the fireplace should always be bright and 
well-swept ; in summer it should be filled with shavings, or some graceful 
white ornament, with a few coloured flowers on it. A small bundle of 
the threads of tarletane pulled out, have a very light and vapoury ap- 
pearance. Living fern leaves, or good bunches of lilac, are charming in 
the country fireplace. Brackets on the wall are cheap and pretty. 

The dining-room requires a stronger carpet than the drawing-room, 
being in moderate houses more used, as the housekeeper of small means 
generally avoids the expense of a double fire, by sitting in it till after 
luncheon or early dinner ; also the feet of the servants waiting at table 
wear the dining-room carpet. It should be a strong Brussels, harmonizing 
in colour with the paper and furniture. The mantelpiece does not abso- 
lutely require ornaments, though a marble clock, bronze (or imitation bronze) 
candlesticks, the same material for spill stands, look comfortable. The 
dining-table should be a telescope one of mahogany, not French polished, 
because hot dishes leave marks on the varnish. It should be polished with 
oil and hard rubbing. The whole furniture should be mahogany, but the 
chairs should not have horsehair cushions ; no room can look nice with them, 
nor with a horsehair couch. They should be mounted in leather, or at 
least American cloth, but the latter soon wears out. An American chair, 
a leather easy-chair, a sideboard, or a waggon (if the former be too ex- 
pensive), and a writing-table in the window if it be a bow-window, will 
furnish this room moderately well. When there is no library, the book- 
shelves are generally on each side of the dining-room fireplace. 

The hall does not require more than an umbrella-stand, pegs for hats, 
etc., a chair, and a small hall-table. Floorcloth should be strong, and 
should harmonize with the walls in colour. A weather-glass is useful 
in the hall. 

In the bedrooms much reduction in expense may be achieved by a 
little ingenuity. The room need not be carpeted all over. A piece of 
Kidderminster in the centre of the room suffices, and is healthier, for it 
can be shaken every week ; the boards round, which are apt in London to 
be discoloured, may be stained oak colour and varnished, when they will 
dust and wipe easily. No carpet should be under the bed, nor should 
there be a valance — only the oak-stained floor. The curtains should be 
pure white dimity — the prettiest and cleanest-looking of all, or, if cretonne 
could be afforded, they would be pretty, but they are very expensive, as 
they do not wash well. Two chairs, a washing-stand and bath, a piece of 
bound flannel for the bath to stand on, and a chest of drawers, are indis- 
pensable ; a deal toilette table, with a ledge for holding boots and shoes 



30 Pincushions for the Toilet, etc. 



underneath it, is good enough. It is covered with a lined book-muslin 
toilette. Some old-fashioned families cover the back of the looking-glass 
with muslin, and draw it in with bows of ribbon at the hinges. This has 
a pretty effect, only the edge (of lace) showing in front. In cases where 
the bedroom is very small, the toilette table may be utilized, by having 
shelves under it (enclosed with sides and a door) for dresses. The toilette 
muslin being made to open in the same place as the doors — i.e., in the 
middle of the front — will throw back and allow the doors to open easily. 
The dresses can be laid at full length in it. 

All bedrooms require the same furniture, more or less. It should all be 
of the same kind of wood, whether mahogany, walnut, or painted deal, as 
harmony of colour is required to make the room look well. 

Cheap bedroom bookshelves may be made thus : Cut a plank of 
about three or four feet in halves. The plank should be a good inch 
thick ; plane the halves and paint them, also the edges ; take four and 
a half yards of red or green cord ; divide it in halves. Take the shelves, 
make four holes in them, one in each corner, exactly over each other in 
each shelf. Put one of the halves of cord through the front hole of the 
bottom shelf on the right side, tie a knot in the end to keep it from slipping 
through — a good large knot for the shelf to rest on ; leave a piece of cord 
above the hole through which it is passed, the height of your highest book ; 
tie another knot, pass the cord through the front hole at the righthand of 
the other shelf ; then put it through the front le/thand side of the second 
shelf, and tie a knot, then pass it through the front lefthand hole of the 
bottom shelf and tie a knot ; cut off ; be careful that both sides are 
exactly the same height before you cut off the cord or tie the knots ; it 
requires careful management. Next pass a cord through the back right- 
hand hole, tie a knot below ; measure the same length, or height rather, as 
front cord, tie a knot, pass the cord through back righthand hole of 
second shelf; carry it over to back lefthand corner ; pass it through hole, 
tie a knot (after measuring with front cords), pass it through bottom left- 
hand hole and fasten with knot. Take care that the measurement of the 
cord is exact, or the shelves will hang crookedly. Then drive one large 
brass-headed nail into a firm part of the wall (a joist is the place), twist 
the cords together at the top, and hang up the shelves ; or put in two nails, 
and stretch the cord over both, if you wish for more room for your books. 
A prettily made toilette pincushion, a glass or vase of flowers, will greatly 
enliven a chamber. We give two receipts for toilette pincushions :— 
No. I. — Make a round pincushion, with a hollow in the middle of it 
large enough to hold a small tumbler. Paste a firm 
piece of cardboard at the bottom of it. Then make a 
cover of muslin over pink silk, leaving a hole just 
over the hollow in the middle of the pincushion for 
a tiny glass, which you must buy to fit it, and which, 
when the pincushion is on the toilette table, must 
be filled with a bouquet of delicate flowers. A lace 
frill should be sewn round the edge of the pincushion, 
to hang to the bottom of it. 

No. 2. — A small square deal box, lined with pink silk, and covered 
externally with the same. The inside lining should be quilted on flannel ; 
the outside covered first with muslin, and then with a deep lace friL'. 




Home-made Chsets and Cupboards. 31 

Make a pincushion on the lid, cover it with pink silk and spotted muslin, 
and edge it all round with pink silk ribbon rucheing. 

A few good engravings, if possible, may be hung up on the bedroom 
walls. Short muslin blinds are required for the windows ; and against the 
wall behind the washstand, it is well to fix a piece of spotted muslin, 
hemmed round with a broad hem, in which a coloured ribbon is run, 
to guard the wall paper from splashes. 

Old boxes may be utilized and made into seats, by covering them with 
cheap chintz ; the top made plain ; a frill the depth of the box down the 
sides. The top cover should not be joined to the side frills, in order not 
to rumple them when the box is opened. It is sometimes well to stuff a 
cushion with chaff for the top, and to nail it on by the tape which binds it ; 
the chintz cover goes over it, and the side frills are put on as when the box is 
covered without a cushion. But the cushion prevents it from being used 
for travelling purposes without some trouble in uncovering it. The 
loose, unstuffed cover is easily lifted off when the box is required else- 
where, or the chintz requires washing. A long trunk thus stuffed at the 
top and covered at the sides, makes a nice seat at the foot of the bed, and 
is very convenient tor putting away dresses at full length. Smaller boxes 
do for keeping bonnets or any other garments in. It is astonishing how a 
little ingenuity will help to beautify a room and make it comfortable. 

For persons who cannot afford a toilette service, a nice box pincushion 
may be made from an old cigar-box, to be purchased for threepence at any 
tobacconist's. It should be lined with glazed pink calico, a pincushion 
stuffed and fastened on the top, edged with lace or quilted ribbon. The 
sides must be first covered with pink calico and then with muslin frills 
edged with lace, or hung with lace frills the depth of the box, fastened to 
the edges of the sides. The china pots in which potted-meat is sold will 
also help to furnish cheaply the lady's toilette-table. 

One great defect of modern houses is the want of closets and cup- 
boards. Ingenuity and industry can, however, often supply this deficiency. 
A good closet for hanging dresses may be made in a bedroom recess, by 
merely putting a shelf of deal a little way from the ceiling, and a thin slip 
of the same across the recess at the bottom ; along the edge of the shelf 
fix a strong red cord, by a brass-headed nail at each end. Do the same 
at the bottom edge. Then take some cheap chintz, or cretonne, or dimity ; 
hem it top and bottom, and put on small rings. Pass these through 
the cords, and the curtains will draw backwards and forwards quite 
easily ; if they set in slight flutes so much the better, the housewife will thus 
have a pretty-looking wardrobe at little cost. Next as to cupboards. Nearly 
everybody possesses some old boxes, or packing-cases ; place one on its 
side, with its open top towards you ; another on it, and another on that if 
possible. They should stand by a wall on the landing-place of the stair- 
case or in any convenient corner, and be fixed to the wall thus ; hammer 
into the wall two strong nails on each side about the middle of each box. 
Make a hole large enough for a cord or rope to go through in the sides 
of each of them, and thus tie them securely to the wall. The expense of 
making the lids into a door will not be great ; a hinge on each box and a 
strong lock also will be necessary. Cover them with one of those hall 
papers, which are excellent imitations of wood, and you will have a good 
closet, which if you leave the house can be re-converted into packing-cases. 



32 Bedsteads, Beds, etc. 



Whilst we are on the subject of bedrooms, we feel inclined to complete 
our subject by an extract from one of Leigh Hunt's charming essays :— 
" Order in a house/' he says, " first manifests itself in the room which the 
housewife inhabits, and every sentiment of the heart, as well as of the 
external graces, demands that a very reverence and religion of neatness 
should be there exhibited ; not formality, not a want of snugness, but all 
which evidences that the esteem of a life is preferred to the slatternliness of 
the moment 

" Commend us (for a climate like ours) to a bedchamber of the middle 
order, such as it was set out about a hundred years back, and may still 
be seen in the houses of some old families, the room of moderate size, the 
fourpost-bed neatly and plentifully but not richly draperied ; the chairs 
draperied also, down to the ground ; a drapery over the toilette ; the 
carpet a good old Turkey or Brussels, not covering the floor and easily to 
be taken up and shaken ; the wardrobe and drawers of old shining oak, 
walnut, or mahogany ; a few cabinet pictures, as elegant as you please ; 
the windows with seats, and looking upon some green place ; two or three 
small shelves of books ; and the drawers, when they are open, redolent of 
lavender and clean linen. We dislike the cut-and-dried look of modern 
fashions ; the cane chairs, formal-patterned carpets, and flimsy rooms ; 
modern times (or till very lately they were so) are all for lightness and 
cheap sufficiency, and what is considered a Grecian elegance ; they 
realize only an insipid or gaudy anatomy of things, a cold pretension, and 
houses that will tumble upon the heads of our grandchildren. But these 
matters, like others, are gradually improving. If our bedroom is to be 
perfect it should face the east, to rouse us pleasantly with the morning 
sun ; and in case we should be tempted to lie too long in so sweet a nest, 
there should be a happy family of birds at the windows to salute our rise 
with songs."* 

Here is another charming picture by the hand of a great novelist : — 
u The room in which I found myself was one of those never seen out of 
England, and only there in unpretending country houses which have 
escaped the innovating tastes of fashion. A bedstead of the time of 
George I., with mahogany-fluted columns and panels at the bedhead, dark 
and polished, decorated by huge watch-pockets of some great-grand- 
mother's embroidery, white spotless curtains, the walls in panel, and 
covered in part with framed engravings a century old, a large high screen 
separating the washstand from the rest of the room, made lively by old 
caricatures and prints, doubtless the handiwork of female hands long 
stilled A sweet, not strong, odour of dried lavender escaped from a chest 
of drawers polished as bright as the bedstead. The small lattice-paned 
window opened to the fresh air, the woodbine framing it all round from 
without ; amongst the woodbine the low hum of bees. A room for early 
sleep and cheerful rising with the eastern sun, which the window faced/'t 

We venture to suggest to inmates of small houses the idea of the high 
screen, as a substitute for a dressing-room, Such a screen would not be 
expensive ; a common drying clothes-horse would suffice, with canvas or 



'Men, Women, and Books," vol. i. pp. 120, 121, 
f Lord Lyiton's " Caxtoniana," vol. ii. p. 94. 



Cheap Furniture. $$ 



any cotton cloth strained over it. Pictures should then be pasted or 
gummed all over it, and a cheap varnish passed over all. It is indeed to 
be wished that this forgotten decency could be restored to our homes. 
Making a screen, too, would be an excellent household amusement in 
which all might join. 

We must now say a few words about bedsteads, beds, and bedding. 
Iron bedsteads are cheapest upon the whole, and may be either with or 
without furniture. They may have a half-tester and curtains, or a wooden 
pole may be fixed in the wall and the curtains may hang from it. The 
latter makes the bedstead come cheaper, and looks well, but the 
curtains are apt to hang rather close to the head. If the bedstead stands 
as French beds are intended to do, with its side to the wall, the curtains 
make a tent above it and hang over head and foot, but they should be put 
back from the latter before sleeping, that the sleeper may have plenty of 
air. The cheapest curtains are dimity, and really nothing looks better if 
they are kept clean and snowy white ; about eighteen yards will make a 
pair of bed curtains for a three feet wide bed, with one breadth and 
a half in each curtain ; but two breadths, which would be thirty-six yards, 
would be much handsomer, and are required to cover a bed five feet six 
inches wide. The curtains must first be bound with braid, and then 
a white fringe should be sewed down one side ; the other joins behind 
the head, or by the side of the bed, and does not require any. This 
fringe might easily be made by the housemother herself, or some of the 
young people, by knitting in ends of cotton according to the following 
receipt : — 

" Cast on eleven stitches ; one plain row ; knit two ; turn over the needle 
and knit two together ; turn, and knit two together ; turn, and knit two 
together ; put the fringe over the needle ; knit two ; turn over the fringe 
and knit one plain row back, and repeat." 

Or the curtains may have a border sewn on of scarlet Turkey twill, or 
washing cambric of any other colour, or they may have a coloured fringe ; 
but if the room be bright and sunny, pure white will look much the best. 
Cretonne and chintz are both too expensive for small means. It looks nice 
to loop back the curtains in the daytime to the bedpost, with either white 
binding, or if the trimming be coloured, with ribbon of the same hue ; or 
if this is not liked, the curtains when they fall on each side of the head of 
the bed, may be raised by the servant, and their ends laid on the pillow. 
Of course, the bed and window curtains must be alike. Mattresses 
are more used than feather beds in the present day, being thought more 
conducive to health. The best mattress is the spring mattress. It 
is made of a succession of coils of stout copper wire, sometimes gal- 
vanized. These are set in a framework of stout laths, having one or 
two transverse bars from head to foot as the width requires. The springs 
are fastened to the laths, and secured to strong canvas at the top, upon 
which is laid a padding of wool covered with the ordinary check covering. 
These mattresses cost, for a three feet wide and six long bedstead, it. js., 
and for one five feet wide, 2/. 10s. A thin woollen mattress is required 
on the top for the protection of the springs. Ordinary woollen mattresses 
are softer than thin horsehair ones, as well as cheaper ; but a good thick old- 
fashioned hair mattress on a straw paillasse, or better still on a sacking, is 
an excellent bed.

34 Purchasing Secondhand Furniture. 

Feather beds are expensive, except to those who pick their own poultry 
and can save the feathers, which should, however, be thoroughly well- 
baked before using. A feather bed, bolster, and pillows cost about 12/. 
for a full-sized bed. In purchasing one, it is well to go to a very reliable 
and respectable shop, as sad tricks are occasionally played in the making 
of feather beds. We remember how a lady once in a ready furnished 
house, feeling something very hard in her bed, opened a portion of the 
seam and found the whole wing of a goose in its original state, pieces of 
old woollen cloth, etc. Besides, there are different qualities of fea- 
thers. If on pressing your hand on the bed it rises up again quickly, the 
feathers are fresh and good. If the bed does not rise at all, they are old 
feathers cleaned, which are really objectionable ; and here we must observe 
that feathers hold infection in a remarkable degree. Many families keep 
scarlet fever as a perfect inheritance from ignorance of this fact, and 
lodging-house beds by the seaside often give fever and even smallpox to 
the unlucky visitors. Nothing will disinfect a bed except unmaking it, 
having the feathers re-baked, and the tick washed, with a little of Condy's 
disinfecting fluid or chloride of lime in the water. The cost of purifying 
feathers is $\d. per pound. Pillows are expensive things. Very good, 
cool, and pleasant ones, most grateful to patients in fevers, may be made 
by curling paper and stuffing a tick with it. For this purpose all old 
useless notes, circulars, etc., should be saved. The paper is cut into 
narrow strips, and curled round a rather blunt penknife. A little shredded 
flannel or cloth should be mixed with it, and the pillow should not be 
stuffed too hard. 

Beds and mattresses may be stuffed with chaff, but once a year it must 
be taken out and fresh put in, instead of that used. Well dried moss 
answers the same purpose, and in some countries dried birch leaves are 
used. 

If poor people would only gather the seeds of the thistle — thistle- 
down — every year, and keep their collections in dry paper bags, they would 
soon have enough for the softest of down pillows, and at the same time 
that they were preparing this great luxury for themselves they would be 
diminishing the thistles for the benefit of cultivation. 

Blankets. 

About three for each bed should be provided, small or large as required. 
For people who can afford them, duvets — i.e., down coverlets — are very 
delightful and ornamental. In some families four and even five blankets 
are allowed to each bed ; but we give the lowest possible number which 
will be required. The better the quality of the blankets the fewer will be 
required. They are sold by the width and length, and should be selected 
for their weight, softness, and thickness. The price of very good " extra 
supers " is from 30J. to $os. per pair. Aldershot blankets are often used 
for servants. They are only 6s. per pair. 

Marseilla quilts are in ordinary use and maybe of several qualities. A 
patchwork quilt lined with soft brown paper would be found very warm in 
winter. Knitted quilts are pretty, but the cotton for making them comes 
expensive.

The servant's bedroom should be made as comfortable as possible, and 
she should be encouraged to keep it nice and neat. Commend her for 
any attempt to adorn her bedroom. 

PURCHASING SECONDHAND FURNITURE. 

Furniture may be purchased very cheaply at sales, but in order not to 
run any risk of being tricked by brokers running up the prices, it is best to 
mark a catalogue with the exact sum you would give for each article, and 
not on any account to exceed it ; or you could give a catalogue thus marked 
to a broker, and pay him a per centage on his obtaining the articles at 
your price. The furniture you intend to buy, you should previously closely 
examine. If it is wooden furniture, see that the surfaces are level, that 
there are no cracks or rickety legs or starting veneer. If the furniture is 
really good, it will be better to buy it than to purchase new, because the 
fact of its having been properly seasoned is proved, and it easily and 
cheaply re-polishes. 

We do not recommend purchasing carpets or curtains at a sale. The 
latter seldom fit, and unless they a?'e known to have been only a short time 
in wear, their lasting cannot be relied on. The same may be said of 
kitchen utensils. 

In purchasing glass and china there can, of course, be little possibility 
of mistake. 

We add a list of kitchen utensils for small houses, and for large ones, 
as some guide to persons about to furnish ; and similar lists of all the 
other necessaries required in housekeeping.

In very large establishments, "kitcheners" are now generally used. In 
small houses they are less desirable, as they are apt to spread a smell of 
red-hot iron through the dwelling, and even the ventilating kitchener, 
which is best for this purpose, makes a small kitchen too hot for the health 
of its inmates. The same may be said of the cottager's stove. 

Gas cooking-stoves will be found handy, and very economical.

LAMPS. 

Gas is very generally used now in towns. It is the cheapest light 
there is, and the dirtiest. It defaces and tarnishes gold, blackens the 
ceilings, and unbinds books ; nevertheless it is popular on account of its 
cheapness and the amount of light derived from it. In halls, over door- 
ways, in passages and kitchens, it is really valuable, and as a means of 
lighting streets a great public boon. Gas chandeliers, which alone belong 
to our article on furniture, may be of any degree of elegance. In dining- 
rooms they should be of bronze ; in drawing-rooms, gilt. Petroleum and 
paraffin lamps are the cheapest next to gas, but the burning them is at- 
tended with considerable danger. In fact, an increased premium is required 
by insurance offices for premises where paraffin is burned. There is also a 
disagreeable vapour arising from these oils which is very objectionable. 

The Duplex lamp in which silver oil is burned, is now generally preferred 
to all others ; but unless very carefully filled and trimmed, there is often 
a disagreeable smell with it. We are old-fashioned enough to prefer the 
colza oil to any other still. 

Reading lamps of pretty form and very reasonable are now to be 
bought, and are a great additional evening comfort. 

Moderator lamps, with colza oil, are, we think, the best lights yet 
known, after gas. They may be purchased at any price, from ijs. or iSs. 
Some of them are exceedingly pretty. 

For a small household, one moderator lamp will suffice. For a large 
establishment, where gas is not burned, as in country houses, about four 
will be sufficient. Chandeliers and wax candles supply the most delicious 
of lights. 

A nice hand lamp is also desirable. 

Moderator Lamps. 

It is useless to describe, in detail, the mode of making a moderator 
lamp, as the way it is constructed has not much to do with its manage- 
ment. The Moderator lamp is an Argand lamp in principle, with an 
arrangement for forcing the oil up from a reservoir in the pedestal by 
means of a piston and springs. These lamps are very apt to get out of 
order, and after being once repaired are still more liable to being so ; the 
greatest care and cleanliness is required in the management of them. The 
upper portion of the lamp should be kept quite clean by washing it very 
often with strong soda and water to remove the clotted oil. The cotton 
wicks, before putting them freshly in, should be dried in the oven for 



40 



Gas. 



twenty minutes. In winter the oil-can should be placed near the 
kitchen fire before the oil is poured into the lamp, and the lamp must not 
be kept in a cold room or the oil will congeal and not flow freely. Every 
day the lamp must be trimmed, the black edge of the cotton wick must be 
cut off very evenly* with scissors made for the purpose, and fresh oil 
must be added. The chimney and globe must also be kept very clean or 
the light will be impeded. Never wash the chimney ; if once wet it will 
break as soon as the lamp is lighted. Clean it with a brush leather 
made for the purpose and sold with the lamp at the lamp shops. 
Wash the globe in soda and water. The lamp should always be lighted 
with a wax taper, as, if ends of lucifers fall in, or bits of burnt paper, 
they will make the inside of the lamp and the oil dirty and injure its 
efficiency. 

The oil-can must also be kept very clean, as dirty oil will at once spoil 
a lamp. To clean the can, drain it thoroughly first — then take a small 
mop (such as is used for cleaning lamp-glasses) tie it tightly to a long 
stick, and wipe out the can well. Make a strong soap-lather, with carbolic 
or yellow soap, pour it into the can ; rinse well with it. Then rinse 
thoroughly with clean water, and drain till dry. 

Colza oil is used for this lamp ; it costs 4s. gd. or 4s. 6d. per gallon ; 
half-a-gallon a week in depth of winter suffices for one lamp. 

To prevent Lamps from Smoking. 

Soak the wick in strong vinegar, and dry it well before you use it ; 
this answers very well. 

GAS. 

Gas consists of light carburetted hydrogen, defiant gas, hydrogen, 
carbonic oxide, nitrogen, vapour of volatile liquid, carbides of hydrogen, 
vapour of bisulphide of carbon. 

Great care should be taken in the use of gas — a tap left unturned may 
cause the most serious accidents — kill a servant, or blowup a room. If 
by any chance it has escaped, windows should be at once opened to admit 
the atmospheric air, and let it escape, and it should be turned off at the 
main. We are of opinion that this should always be done at night, as in 
case of fire its presence in the pipes might prove dangerous, should a 
portion of them melt. The dry meter is the best. 

The quantity of gas used can be noted and checked from the dial-plate 
in front of the meter. 

Ventilation is especially required where gas is used, as it poisons the 
air, and blackens furniture and paper very much where ventilation is 
wanting. 

The price of gas varies from 4^. 6d. to 3^. 6d. the thousand feet. 

Light from Gas. 

Although chimneys are essential to argand gas-burners, and globes 
also in many places where fish-tail burners are used, and the ornamental 



* If unevenly cut the lamp will flare, and the flame will come above the 
chimney. 



Effect of Gas on Steel Pens. — The China Closet. 41 

effect is pleasant, still they are detrimental to the diffusion of the light of 
gas. A clear glass globe obstructs about 12 per cent, of light ; a clear 
globe engraved with flowers about 24 per cent. ; a globe ground all over 
40 per cent. ; an opal globe 60 per cent. Hence the folly is apparent 
of using elaborately engraved and ground glass globes or shades where it 
is desirable to economize. If engraved at all, the upper portion of the 
globe only should be embellished, while the lower part should be left clear 
for the free passage of light. 

Effect of Gas on Steel Pens. 

When the pen has been written with, and appears spoiled, place it 
over a gaslight, for a short time — say a quarter of a minute — then dip it in 
water, and it will again be in good condition to write with. Also any new 
pen which is too hard to write with, will become softer with being heated 
in the same way. 

THE CHINA CLOSET. 

Two hundred years ago china was the Englishwoman's passion ; the 
fancy for it was carried to an extent of folly satirized by most of the 
writers of the day. " There is no inclination in women," says Addison, 
" that more surprises me than this passion for china. When a woman is 
visited with it, it generally takes possession of her for life. China vessels 
are playthings for women of all ages. An old lady of fourscore shall be 
as busy in cleaning an Indian mandarin as her great-granddaughter is in 
dressing her baby." 

" If you were to come into my great parlour," says a correspondent of 
the Spectator, "you would fancy yourself in an India warehouse. 
Besides this, she (his wife) keeps a squirrel, and I am doubly taxed to pay 
for the china he breaks." 

"And mistress of herself, tho' china fall ' 

was considered then the height of womanly endurance. 

Even men shared in this taste as collectors, and of Horace Walpole it 
was said — 

11 China's the passion of his soul, 
A cup, a plate, a dish, a bowl 
Can kindle wishes in his breast, 
Inflame with joy, or break his rest." 

The taste still lingers amongst collectors, though generally kept within 
reasonable bounds ; there are still ladies also who treasure their heritage 
of old china — and with reason. The ceramic is assuredly a charming 
art, and true taste will always delight in the artistic beauty of the exquisite 
porcelain of Dresden, Sevres, Berlin, Capo di Monte, and our own old 
Chelsea. There is a china closet in most old family dwellings, in which 
are garnered the ancient possessions of ancestors and friends, of the value 
of which too often the possessor is ignorant. A few words on pottery and 
porcelain may therefore not be unwelcome to our readers. 

Pottery — the manufacture of vessels of all kinds from clay— is a very 
ancient art, cultivated long ere sculpture or painting had charmed the 



42 



The China Closet. 



world. Early in Scripture the potter is named, and many are the simili- 
tudes furnished by his art.* The second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, 
founded a potters' college, and the art was held in honour by all the 
ancient nations of the earth. The funeral pottery found in tombs, and 
easily assignable to the people who were its makers, has been of the very 
greatest service to the historian ; it ascertains for him the limits of Greek 
and Roman dominion, and of Mahometan sway, while the degree of civili- 
zation, and domestic habits of nations can be tolerably well learned from 




Sevres Porcelain, French Exhibition, 1 86 7. 

the same source. But we have to speak of china as a charm of the home, 
not as an object of antiquarian research. And first of all, the exquisite 
Oriental china, which has never been surpassed in quality, occurs to us. 
The Chinese first brought the ceramic art to perfection ; and the celebrated 
porcelain tower near Nankin, is a lasting memorial of their devotion to it. 
The glazed tiles of this tower are oifayence, covered with brilliant glaze, 
and a legend says that a human life was given to achieve the manufacture 
of this species of china. 

A Chinese Emperor ordered porcelain tiles to be manufactured of a 
size and kind which the workmen found it impossible to produce. The 
sovereign would not however hear of an impossibility, and the mandarin 
who had to enforce the imperial command, endeavoured to goad on the 
workmen to its achievement by means of cruel punishments ; one of them 
overcome at last by despair, leaped into the glowing furnace, and was con- 
sumed. When the same furnace was afterwards opened, the porcelain 
was found exactly that which had been required, and from that hour the 
man who had thus perished was worshipped by the potters as their tute-

lary deity. The funny little corpulent figures called magots are images of 
this deified workman* 

The Portuguese traders were the first who introduced the fine wares of 
china into the trade of Europe, though single specimens of it as gifts 
to royal persons, etc., had before found their way here. It was the 
Portuguese who gave it the name of porcelain — i.e., Porcellana. Its glossy 
whiteness reminded them of the pearly lining of the cowrie shells which 
were (and are still) used as money in the East, and as they called these 
shells ftorcella, or " little pigs" (from the likeness of their shape to the back 
of that animal) they transferred a modification of the name to the china. 
They enjoyed a monopoly of the trade in it for some time ; and when 
they ceased to possess it the Dutch obtained it and kept it long. 

The first Chinese porcelain brought into England is believed to have 
been presented to Queen Elizabeth by Cavendish, the celebrated traveller. 
That the great queen had a true woman's taste for china we may infer 
from the New Year's gifts made to her in 1587-8 when Lord Burghley pre- 
sented her with " one porringer of white porselyn garnished with gold," and 
Mr. Robert Cecil gave her " a cup of grene porselyn." These gifts were 
probably purchased from seamen who had captured Spanish carracks, 
and who disposed of this part of the cargo ; for there was no trade in 
china till the East India Company had formed their first establishment at 
Gombron. 

Nankin Porcelain is blue and white ; the clearness of the white and 
fineness of the blue determine its value. 

The old sea-green or Celadon is very valuable. So also is the trans- 
parent china called " egg-shell" china, which is wonderfully thin and 
fragile. A sister of the writer possesses some cups of it which are per- 
fectly transparent. The citron-coloured and ruby are extremely rare, being 
made only for the Emperor's use ; they are not allowed to be sold publicly. 

Japanese China is superior to Chinese in the quality of the paste 
and the colours, which are generally blue and red — some is of lacquered 
ware, with subjects in mother-of-pearl. 

Majolica is Italian pottery, sometimes known under the name of Raf- 
faele ware or Umbrian ware. It was manufactured, it is believed, in imita- 
tion of the Moorish pottery taken by the Pisans from Majorca. Hence its 
first name. Afterwards it was called Raffaele ware because it was de- 
corated with paintings from the copper plates that the great engraver 
Marc Antonio printed from the famous Raffaele's works. 

Palissy's Pottery (French) is also greatly valued. The story of his life- 
long struggles, of his discouraging wife, and his death in the Bastile, are 
familiar to most readers from the pretty tale called " Madame Palissy's 



* A very intelligent little Chinese girl told the writer some four or five years 
ago, that a female infant is sacrificed still at times for the success of the porcelain 
manufacture. The child is told to look at some wonderful thing in the furnace, 
and is then pushed in. " They think," she said, in her broken English, "that 
china sure to come out very good then." It was evidently a tale heard in the 
nursery ; but considering the amount of cruelty and superstition known to exist 
amongst the celestials, it is not impossible that it may be true. In fact the 
worship of the unfortunate Pousa may have given the Chinese potters the idea of 
such a sacrifice. 



44 The China Closet. 



Troubles/' Palissy's fayence is decorated with subjects in relief, never 
with flat painting. The colours are usually yellows, blues, and greys — 
sometimes violet, green, and brown. His plates, dishes, etc., repre- 
sent the fossil shells, reptiles, fish and plants of the neighbourhood of 
Paris. But these are not all his works. There are statuettes, cups, salt- 
cellars, incense burners, and baskets by him of great beauty. 

The Fayence of Henry II.'s time is wonderfully beautiful and much 
valued. It is made of a hard paste, while the Majolica and Palissy ware 
are both of soft paste. Majolica is covered with a thick coating of enamel. 
The Fayence of Henry II. (French) is only covered with a thin transparent 
yellowish glaze — dark yellow is the predominant colour of some of its 
patterns. Its decorations, in relief, are generally pink. 

Porcelain is composed of two substances — alumina or clay, called 
technically Kaolin, which cannot be melted by heat ; the other felspar or 
petro-silex — called pe-tun-tse — which will vitrify in heat. Hard paste 
porcelain is composed of a greater proportion of alumina and less of silex. 
It requires greater heat in the furnace, and is of a denser substance than 
soft paste porcelain. The soft paste porcelain has more silex with the 
addition of alkaline fluxes, and therefore requires less furnace heat and is 
less dense. It is easily scratched by a knife. Porcelain is in short a sub- 
stance between earthenware pottery and glass. 

The first European hard porcelain was made at Dresden, under the 
auspices of Frederick Augustus I. Elector of Saxony, and afterwards 
King of Poland. The circumstances attending the Saxon discovery of 
the art are remarkable. 

There dwelt at Berlin an apothecary's assistant called John Frederick 
Bottcher, who was suspected of being an alchemist, and compelled to fly 
for safety to Saxony. The Elector Augustus sent for him, and demanded 
of him whether he truly possessed the secret of making gold. Bottcher 
denied any such power, but the Elector did not believe him, and placed 
him under the charge of the alchemist, Tschirnhaus, who was then em- 
ployed by the prince in the search for the Elixir of Life and the Philo- 
sopher's Stone. Whilst working at the furnaces, Bottcher perceived in the 
contents of some crucibles a substance resembling Oriental porcelain. He 
communicated his discovery to the Elector, who perceived the importance 
of the discovery, and at once removed Bottcher to the Castle of Albrechts- 
burg, in Meissen, where (though he supplied him with all possible comforts 
and luxuries) he detained the poor artist a close prisoner till his 
death. Tho first attempts of Bottcher produced only a kind of red 
stone-ware ; it was not till the occurrence of another accidental cir- 
cumstance, in 1709, that he was enabled to manufacture white porcelain. 
The circumstance was this : — An iron-master of the Erzgcbirge, 
named Schnorr, riding one day near Aue (in Saxony), found his horse's 
hoofs continually stick fast in a soft white clay. As hair-powder was 
in general use at the time, it occurred to him that this clay, dried and 
powdered, might be a substitute for the wheat-flour employed in the 
manufacture of it. He collected some of the earth, carried it to Carls- 
feld, and had a hair-powder made of it, of which he sold at Dresden 
and other places great quantities. One of its purchasers was Bottcher. 
He noticed its singular weight in his hair ; ascertained where it was 
bought, and that it was an earth, and at once tried it as a clay, or kaolin,

for his ware. It proved the right material for making white porcelain, and 
the great manufactory at Meissen was at once established by Augustus. 
This clay was known henceforth as Schnorrische iveisse Erde, and was 
taken to the manufactory in sealed barrels by persons sworn to secresy. 

Horoldt succeeded Bottcher as head of the Meissen manufactory in 
1720. In 1731, Kandler, a sculptor, superintended the modelling, and the 
art rose to a great degree of perfection. The best productions of Kandler 
were the "Lute Player "representing "Hearing," from his allegorical groups 
of the " Senses." " The Broken Looking Glass," " Marriage a-la-Mode ;" 
"The Love Letter," and several groups of children. Dresden figures have 
in fact ever since been famous. 

Dresden candelabra have never been surpassed. A friend of the 
writer possesses two, on which the flowers are life-like. The " lace " on 
figures is of especial beauty. We have been told by a collector that it is 
real lace which is put into the clay, and reappears as lace in china. Berlin 
china stands second to Dresden in beauty of form and colour. The 
manufacture was commenced by Frederick the Great after his occupation 
of Dresden in the Seven Years' War. He established it by a shameful 
act of injustice : — He despatched large masses of the " Schnorrische" 
Kaolin, or clay, to Berlin, and sent off captive thither the best modellers 
and painters of Meissen, who were compelled thenceforward to toil in the 
service of the conqueror and inveterate enemy of their country. Never- 
more were these unfortunate exiles allowed to return to their native land ; 
their descendants or pupils are still the subjects of Prussia. 

Frederick compelled the Jews to become his customers by refusing to 
allow them to marry till they had purchased a service of Porcelain from 
the royal manufactory, from the trade of which he obtained 200,000 crowns 
annually. 

Berlin is celebrated for the manufacture of lithophanes, or transparent 
pictures in white porcelain. A sister of the writer possesses an exquisite 
nightlight-holder, and kettle, of the purest transparency ; the light within 
exhibiting the most charming pictures perfect in light and shade. The 
Berlin Biscuit figures are also very charming. 

English porcelain was chiefly of soft paste ; that of Bow was coeval 
with Chelsea, to which it bears a resemblance. A bee is often seen on 
it, either embodied or painted on the handle or under the spout of the 
cream-jug. 

Chelsea china was manufactured in Queen Anne's reign, but was not 
then remarkable for excellence. Under the patronage of George II. and 
the Duke of Cumberland (of Culloden memory) it rose rapidly to excel- 
lence ; and in George III.'s time quite equalled Dresden china. Its 
colours are fine and vivid, especially the one peculiar to Chelsea, the 
claret colour. Paul Ferg, a German artist, and Beaumont painted the 
best landscapes on it. Foreign artists probably designed the birds, insects 
and flowers which enrich it. 

The manufactory was situated at the corner of Justice Walk, and 
occupied the house at the upper end of Lawrence Street. 

" The factory stood just below the bridge, upon the site of Lord 
Dartery's house. My father worked for them at one time," said Nolle- 
kens. "Yes," replied Betew, "and Sir James Thornhill designed for 
them Paul Ferg painted for them. The cunning rogues produced

very white and delicate ware, but then they had their clay from China, 
which when the Chinese found out they would not let the captains have 
any more for ballast, and the consequence was that the whole concern 
failed."* 

A very curious coffee-pot, supposed to have been manufactured for 
George II., is in the family of the writer. It has a silver spout and silver 
edges. It was used daily by the king ; but (according to the fashion of 
those days) became, with all the other china and glass, a perquisite of 
the captain of his yacht after his Majesty's first or second voyage to 
Hanover. 

Chelsea china is of great value, and sells for very high prices. Its 
manufacture ceased in 1765, whether from the merchant captains failing 
to obtain Chinese kaolin for ballast ! or by the smuggling in of Dresden 
china at a nominal duty by foreign ministers, is not clear. 

Worcester china is remarkable for its durability as well as excellence. 
Coalbrook Dale china (Shropshire) was more for use than ornament, but 
was nevertheless often beautiful. 

French porcelain ranks very high. The royal porcelain manufacture 
of Sevres was patronized by Madame de Pompadour. Difficulties in 
procuring the kaolin, or clay, for white porcelain at first impeded this 
manufacture, but the needful material was again discovered by chance, 
that is, if observation can deserve so to be designated. Madame Darnet, 
the wife of a poor surgeon residing at St. Yricix, near Limoges, perceived 
in a ravine through which she happened to be walking, a white unctuous 
earth. She must have been an intelligent woman, and anxious to reduce 
needful household expenses, for she thought it possible that this clay 
might serve as a substitute for soap ; so she carried some of it home, and 
displayed it to her husband. He, in turn, showed it to a chemist at Bor- 
deaux, who having heard of the researches then making for proper porce- 
lain earth, sent the specimen to the chemist Macquer, who at once 
declared that it was true kaolin. 

From that period the manufacture rose to great eminence. Our 
readers will be glad to learn that the good housemother, whose wise study 
of economy led to this discovery, finally benefited by it. Madame Darnet 
was reduced to great distress, living in poverty at Paris in 1825, when she 
applied to the celebrated M. Brongniart, the director of the Sevres manu- 
factory, for the means of returning on foot to St. Yrieix. The director 
brought her case before the king, Louis XVI 1 1., who immediately assured 
her future comfort by granting her a pension from the Civil List. 

Sevres china is now the first in estimation. The colours used on it are 
remarkable for their unequalled beauty — the bleu du roi, bleu turquoise, 
Jonquille, vert pre, and lastly, the exquisite rose du Barry, a very lovely 
pink, are the principal tints. The paintings on it, by Watteau and other 
masters, and the jewelled cupst must be tolerably well known to the 
reader who has visited the South Kensington Museum, etc. Bouquets of 
flowers (the especial work of women) are ancient Sevres, and of great 
value.

The China Closet. 4? 



The Capo di Monte china is very beautiful and very easily recognised. 
It is quite an original china, unlike that of either Germany or France. It 
is decorated in the very highest relief, and the figures are most exquisitely 
moulded. The late George Smith, Esq., of 21, Russell Square, well-known 
for his generous patronage of art, and his skill and judgment in collecting, 
possessed (his widow still possesses) two Capo di Monte vases of great 
beauty. The figures are in such high relief that they appear scarcely 
attached to the side of the vase, and cast light shadows upon it in some 
places ; the paste is of wonderful excellence. The subjects are a vintage 
feast, dancers, &c. 

The marks by which the china we have described may be known have 
now to be mentioned. 

Oriental china is marked in two ways, either by Chinese characters 
which fix the reign or dynasty under which the piece was made, or by 
the marks of the several factories or those of the makers of the pieces ; 
these are various, and the Chinese characters are unmistakeable (several 
works on the subject give the marks chronologically). The acorus 
or the sweet rush, the Gladiolus, the numerical 1 ( — ) and 2 (=), fish, 
a small thin nail, the flower of the plant Lesance, a kind of grain, two 
lions playing with a ball, two ducks painted in the centre of the vase, 
grasshoppers or crickets fighting, a hen and chickens, are all marks to be 
found on Oriental china, and fix with some accuracy its date ; but as our 
limits will not permit us to give them all, we refer our readers for informa- 
tion to Marryat's " History of Pottery and Porcelain," a most valuable 
and exhaustive work, and to Mr. Bonn's volume on the same 
subject. 

Majolica and Palissy ware (which are pottery and not porcelain) are 
easily recognisable from their peculiarities. 

The marks on Dresden china are A.R., signifying Augustus Rex ; 
K.P.M. (Koniglich Porzellan Manufactur) ; the caduceus ; the Electoral 
swords crossed. The period when the King was the actual director of the 
manufactory is marked by the crossed swords having a dot between their 
handles ; sometimes there is a star between the handles, signifying that 
Marcolini was director when the piece was made. 

Berlin porcelain has as marks a W, two strokes of the letter being too 
short and the centre strokes irregularly crossed like an X ; a sceptre in 
brown, if the porcelain be painted and gilded ; in blue, if the porcelain be 
white. Since 1833 the marks have been the sceptre, eagle, and im- 
perial globe in brown, on painted and gilded porcelain, and the sceptre and 
letters K.P.M. (Koniglich Porzellan Manufactur), in blue, if the porcelain 
be white ; another is an eagle burnt in colour on the bottom. 

Dutch porcelain of the Hague has for mark a stork standing on one 
leg with a fish in its mouth. 

The porcelain of Denmark, which is at present excellent, is marked 
with three parallel wavy lines signifying the Sound and the Great and 
Little Belts. 

Swiss porcelain is marked with a fish. 

Bow china has a triangle. 

Of Chelsea — the earliest had no marks — by-and-by came an embossed 
oval with a raised anchor on it — an anchor and cross, and next the red 
and gold anchor. The gold anchor signifies the best Chelsea porcelain,, 



48 The Chi?m Closet. 

Two anchors were sometimes stamped on it, and three dirty spots with- 
out glazing on the bottom of the piece also characterize this porcelain ; 
they were caused by the clumsy tripod on which it stood in the 
furnace. 

Sevres china marks are easily understood, for the na?ne is frequent, and 
royal cyphers, eagles, crowns, fleur de lis, and N with the crown imperial 
at once distinguish it. 

The Capo di Monte marks are a figure resembling a flower with a 
short curled stem ; a crown with a wide N under it ; a tiara like an earl's 
coronet with N under it. These marks are painted in blue or red, or 
graved on the moist clay. 

Plymouth china has for its mark the astronomical symbol for Jupiter. 
The wares in household use in England at present are the Oriental, Japan, 
Dresden, and Sevres, English porcelain made at Worcester and in the 
potteries of Staffordshire ; iron-stone and stone china — a very hard and 
tough kind with little or no transparency; semi-porcelain made for 
cooking and chemical operations, and earthenware — which is known as 
Wedgwood's, delft ware, etc. 

Wedgwood ware has been brought to great perfection. Delft is an 
imitation of the famous Dutch pottery which was in ordinary use in Eng- 
land from the reign of our Henry IV. till Wedgwood's superior produc- 
tion put an end to the delft trade of Holland. The Dutch tiles which 
were formerly used for lining fireplaces, dairies, etc. are well-known. They 
came into fashion in England in 1625 — Charles I.'s reign. 

The materials for English earthenware and porcelain are silica, pro- 
cured from the flints of the Sussex coast and from Antrim in Ireland ; 
alumina from different sorts of clay — from Bideford and the Isle of Pur- 
beck come two pipe clays. A china clay (an extremely white and impal- 
pable powder) is found in catchpools in Cornwall. Magnesium clay, slate 
and shale clays are also used, and bone earth which is made by removing 
the gelatine from bones by boiling, and then calcining and grinding 
them. The process of making pottery is a long one — first the clay is pre- 
pared, next thrown) as it is called; turned, modelled, or pressed ; baked into 
biscuit — painted or printed, glazed and ornamented. 

Washing China* 

Valuable china, such as Oriental, Dresden, or Sevres, should never be 
trusted to the housemaid to dust or wash ; a lady of the family should do 
this task herself. 

For Dresden china, rich in groups of flowers, etc., a soft tooth-brush 
may be required for the very intricate and embossed work. Wash it 
in very clean COLD water, use a little soap, rinse in cold water, and dry 
with a soft wash-leather. Take care to wash it in a wooden bowl, 
as an earthenware basin might possibly crack it. Sevres vases, 
Oriental china, etc., should be washed with a soft sponge in cold water ; 
soap is seldom required, nor washing often, if china is carefully dusted : 
never use soda, it will injure gilding and fade colours. 

For washing ordinary china in daily use for breakfast or tea, use very 
hot water in a wooden bowl. Dip one cup in at a time, wipe it in a clean 



The Linen Press Or Closet 49 

and dry linen cloth. The hot water and separate washing will give a 
polish ; never use soda for fear of injuring the gold or colours. The dirty 
habit of putting all the cups in a pile, draining on each other, in the 
wooden bowl should never be endured. The cups are never freed from 
grease when washed in this manner ; they are always dull-looking and 
sticky. One cup at a time and a clean dry cloth should be the rule. Mr. 
Bamfield of the Crystal Palace says, half the china made is defaced and 
injured by the use of soda. 

Accidents in spite of every care will occasionally happen to china. The 
readiest way to mend a fracture is to take instantly the white of an egg, 
brush it over the edges with a feather, replace the piece, and tie it together 
with a piece of tape till it dries ; this cement will hold the cup or plate 
together so long as it is not wet. 

A strong and lasting cement can be made from white flint. Get a 
chemist to make you some white flint powder, and mix it with resin to the 
consistency of a paste. Keep it for use. The mode of applying it is to 
heat the edges of the fracture and piece, rub the cement on them, and join 
and tie them together. When dry remove the cement which remains outside 
the edges. Or, beat lime into the most impalpable powder, sift it through 
fine muslin ; then tie some into a thin muslin ; put on the edges of the 
broken china some white of egg, then dust some lime quickly on the same, 
and unite them exactly. The Chinese use finely powdered,/?/;// glass with 
the white of an egg-. 



THE LINEN PRESS OR CLOSET* 

The linen press or closet should be in a dry place. Each shelf should 
be covered with clean brown paper, and on it should lie a large muslin 
bag full of lavender, and a small one of camphor. A book should be kept 
in one corner, in which the entire contents of the closet should be entered, 
the number of the shelves stated, and what is on each. 

Stick papers with number on the edge of each shelf. 

This closet must contain all the household linen (lists of which 
are given a little further on) ; the extra blankets or bedding ; the 
counterpanes and quilts ; all pieces of bed furniture ; curtains not in 
actual use ; muslin curtains ; pieces of paper-hangings, and general odds 
and ends. 

The air should be frequently admitted to the press or closet, and 
nothing damp should be put away in it. 

Linen is made from flax, the straw of a European plant which 
has a pretty blue flower. This straw is deprived of its juices by mace- 
ration and washing. It is afterwards bleached, spun, and converted 
by weaving into plain linen — more or less fine — damask, Holland, and 
lawn. 

Cotton is a vegetable down contained in the seed of the cotton plant, 
which is cultivated in America, the East and West Indies, and Egypt. 
Cotton, after many processes, is woven into calico, muslin, chintz, di- 
mity, etc. 

Linen is much more expensive than cotton, but it wears a great deal 

K 



50 The Linen Press or Closet. 

longer. Cloth made of flax is clearer than that made of cotton, and very 
cold to the touch. Cotton is whiter, thicker and warmer to the touch. 

Linen should be purchased at a trustworthy shop, as table-cloths and 
diapered articles are often adulterated with cotton. 

House linen should be nicely marked with the united initials of 
husband and wife, and the number of purchase. By number we do not 
mean I, 2, 3, but on each article the number of which the set consists, 
as 12, 24, 36, as it may be. Example — A B C, 24,1872 ; or A B C, 36, 
1872. 

A good store of fine linen was once the pride of Englishwomen, as well 
as of the Scotch, and to the fact that a maiden must spin her own linen 
for her future home before she was deemed meet to be a wife, we owe the 
word spinster — equivalent to maiden. The pride in household linen, like 
many other good household feelings, has nearly passed away in some 
circles ; but the true housemother who cares for the comfort and beauty 
of her home, will still feel a matronly pride in her linen closet. 

Linen consists of sheets, pillow-cases, tablecloths, table-napkins, towels, 
quilts, etc. 

By persons of very small income only a small quantity of linen 
can be bought at a time, as it is expensive. For two beds, four pairs of 
sheets will suffice ; for three beds, five pairs, as the changing may be 
so managed that the two extra pairs will suffice ; but when there is only 
a small stock of linen, it soon wears out, and has to be replaced ; if, 
therefore, the outlay can be spared, a good stock will be found most 
economical. If however only a few articles of household linen can be 
afforded at a time, it is well to lay by a small sum constantly, with which 
an occasional purchase of a sheet or tablecloth may be made. The fol- 
lowing arc three lists of linen for different incomes : — 



Smallest Quantity. 



6 pairs of good cotton sheets. 
6 pillow cases (untrimmed.) 

3 dozen bedroom towels, part rough, 

part soft, part servants' towels.

2 roller towels. 

4 counterpanes, or one for each bed. 
and two for change. 



2 kitchen tablecloths. 1 4 toilette covers 



Medium Quantity. 



12 pairs of linen sheets (unless cotton 
are preferred.) These include 
servants'. 

2 dozen pillow cases, frilled. 

6 dozen bedroom towels (2 dozen of 
which may be bath towels, and

12 tablecloths. 



24 table napkins. 

6 kitchen tablecloths.

The Linen Press or Closet. 5 1 



Good Quantity. 



24 pairs of linen, cotton, and servants' 

sheets. 
24 pillow cases edged with lace, and 

plain for servants. 
1 2 bath towels 
24 fine towels. 

24 coarse and servants' towels.

12 breakfast cloths. 
6 kitchen tablecloths. 
36 table napkins. 
6 roller towels. 
4 dresser cloths.

14 dusters. 



Nursery linen is not included in these lists. 

Sheets should be 3 yards long and two breadths wide (if they are not 
made of full width linen). Some persons prefer cotton sheets to linen on ac- 
count of their superior warmth ; old East Indians seldom use anything but 
" India sheeting," as it is called, which is of fine twilled cotton. Linen 
sheets last longer, and are fresh and cold to the touch. The housemother 
should have both in her possession, as it is possible some guest, or one of her 
family, may be unable to sleep on linen, from delicate health, rheumatic 
affections, etc. Servants' sheets are generally of cotton. Sheets should 
be thoroughly aired the day they come from the laundress, and then 
folded in pairs for the closet. In one pile should be placed the fine linen 
sheets ; in another the coarser linen ; in a third, the cotton ; in a fourth, 
the servants'. The sheets should be lifted up, and the last washed sheets 
as soon as aired should be placed at the bottom of each pile. Thus each 
pair will be fairly worn in turn. A ticket should hang from the shelf con- 
taining a list of the sheets on it. They must also be entered in the linen 
book. 

Before the sheets are sent to the wash they should be carefully ex- 
amined, and mended if they require repairs. If they have grown thin in 
the middle the centre seam must be unripped and the outside seams be 
turned inwards and sewn together ; or if (as is now usually the case) the 
sheet is made the whole width, it must be cut very carefully and evenly by 
a thread, down the middle, and the sides joined inwards. In both cases 
the outsides must be neatly hemmed. When they are again worn in the 
centre they may be cut across the length, and the short ends sewn together 
in the middle. 

A sheet quite worn out for the bed will still make pillow-cases, dusters, 
etc. etc., and the pieces will be of use for cleaning lamps, candlesticks, etc. 

Pillow-cases may be made quite plain, with strings, or trimmed 
prettily with frills or lace. Very grand pillows are sometimes edged with 
Valenciennes. 

Huckaback towels are excellent for drying the skin, and produce (by 
rubbing) a fine glow. The unbleached material is to be preferred, and it 
should not be fine but thick and loose in texture. It is about So 7 , the 
yard. Eighteen nails is the length for a towel. 

Russian towelling, called by drapers " crash," is a strong material, but 
narrow in width. It costs about $d. a yard. 

Towels are fringed by ravelling out a little of the edge, and loosely 

E 2

sewing over the threads which end the fringe. Many people prefer this 
mode to hemming them. 

Bath towels can be purchased the full size, but a small sheet is much 
more comfortable in the bath room, as one can step into it at once, and 
there is less chance of chill if the bath is a hot one ; but for ordinary use 
it is enough to sew two ordinary towel widths together. It is a good plan 
if it can be managed to mark every room's separate towels. 

The towels, sorted into piles of fine, coarse, bath, and servants', should 
occupy a shelf with a ticket attached to it stating the number of towels 
on it ; they should be aired when they come from the wash, because linen 
put away damp is sure to rot ; and when aired each pile should be lifted 
and the last washed towels should be placed at the bottom. 

Tablecloths may be of great beauty, or merely nice and useful. A 
tablecloth and napkin press is necessary in order that the tablecloth may 
be kept smooth for use. 

Tablecloths and table-napkins should be examined every week before 
they are sent to the wash and all thin places finely darned with soft cotton, 
every other thread being taken. Any stains must be taken out. Table- 
cloths are very liable to accidental stains ; port wine upset on them is one. 
When such an accident as upsetting port or claret on the cloth occurs, in- 
stantly throw some salt on the spot and pour a little sherry on it. Let the 
servant wash it the moment the cloth is removed. 

Ironmoulds can be taken out by wetting the spot, stretching the linen 
over a plate placed over a basin of boiling water, and touching the place 
with salts of lemon ; keeping the plate very hot. As soon as the stain is 
removed, wash in a good deal of hot water. 

To take out stains of acids, fruits, etc., rub the place each side with 
yellow soap, then lay on a paste of starch made with cold water, rub it in, 
and bleach the linen in the sun till the stain comes out. Scorches may be 
removed from linen by spreading over them the following mixture : — Juice 
expressed from two onions, half an ounce of white soap, two ounces of 
fuller's earth, and half a pint of vinegar ; mix and boil well. Let it get 
cold before using it. 

Glass cloths must be of thin linen. Both these and the coarse brown 
towels should be a yard long.- Not more than twelve should be given out to 
the servants at a time, and the mistress of the family should inspect them 
once a month, to see that they are well kept. There is nothing in which 
more loss and waste occurs, than in kitchen towels unless they are looked 
after and examined. When worn, the rags should be produced, as careless 
servants will occasionally throw away a towel rather than wash it if it is 
very dirty — the kitchen servants wash the coarse towels ; the housemaid 
washes the glass cloths. 

Kitchen tablecloths are generally made of unbleached cotton diaper, 
but huckaback will be found cheapest in the end, as it lasts so much 
longer. 

Dusters may be made of old sheets, old chintz, or any remains of cot- 
Ion dresses — they are best of cotton ; but whether of new material or old, 
they should be hemmed. 

Pudding cloths should be squares of thick new Russia sheeting. For 
dumplings, squares knitted in coarse cotton, will give a pretty effect. 
These also should only be given out in certain numbers, and the old ones

shown when new are asked for. The eye of the mistress should often 
inspect the cleanliness of these cloths. 

Fish cloths are made of a species of inferior table-napkin. Many- 
persons now prefer the embossed bordered fish papers, which cost no 
more than the washing of the fish cloth, and look pretty. They are cer- 
tainly an economy. 

Jelly bags are made of a half-handkerchief shaped piece of flannel, 
the two sides sewn together strongly, and the top hemmed, and tape loops 
put to it to hang it up by, or it is in a frame ; but if a small outlay does 
not signify, it is better to buy a jelly bag. 

Scouring flannels should be strong and coarse, the edges should be just 
caught round to save them from fraying out. 

In the linen press or closet should be kept needles, cotton, white and 
black thread, (coarse thread, we mean, for carpets,) curtain rings, patent 
curtain hooks which require no sewing on (they are in the fashion of the 
safety pins invented by the Queen), string, binding, etc., and a large pair 
of cutting-out scissors. These articles may be kept in a large brown 
holland bag suspended from a nail in the door ; it may also contain a 
pencil for making any alterations in the linen lists. 

Linen is usually marked with ink. The following is Mr. Redwood's 
receipt for making marking-ink to be used without preparation : — 

One ounce of nitrate of silver, one and a half-ounce of best washing 
soda, three drachms of tartaric acid, two ounces of distilled water, six 
drachms of white sugar, ten drachms of powdered gum-arabic, half an 
ounce of archil and water. 

Dissolve the nitrate of silver in distilled or rain-water ; distil the soda 
(separately) in rain-water. Mix the solutions, and collect the precipitate ; 
wash it in a filter. Whilst it is still moist, rub it in a mortar, with three 
drachms of tartaric acid ; add the two ounces of distilled water. Mix, 
and add the white sugar, gum-arabic, archil and water, to make up in 
all six ounces. 

The cost is a little over $s., but the quantity makes twenty-four bottle- 
fuls of the usual or Zd. size. Use a quill pen, and expose to the air. 

We give this receipt because our book may possibly travel where 
marking-ink cannot be bought ; but we recommend for English use the 
purchased ink as the best. That which requires preparation, and the 
heat of a hot iron after it is used, lasts much the best. We speak from 
experience. We give an excellent receipt for one, with preparation, long 
used in the family of a friend. 

Marking Ink. 

One drachm and a half of lunar caustic, one scruple of sap-green, six 
drachms of water, two drachms of mucilage. 

The Preparation. 

Half an ounce of subcarbonate of potash, half an ounce of mucilage, 
half an ounce of water. 

This preparation is to be applied to the linen with a brush ; when it is 
nearly dry, rub smooth with the bowl of a spoon and write on the spot 
with the ink.

Ornamentation. 



To restore Scorched or Discoloured Linen. 

For discoloured linen or muslin, grass or seaside bleaching is always 
the best ; but in town, mix a pound of bleaching-powder with six quarts 
of water, and put a portion of this into the tub where the articles are steep- 
ing. 

To take Stains of any kind out of Linen. 

Stains caused by Acids. — Wet the part, and lay on it some salt of 
wormwood. Then rub it without diluting it with more water. 

When white linen becomes mildewed it should be washed in warm 
water, with a little borax, and then rinsed in clean water. After this, it 
must be put into a tub of water, containing a little hydrochloric acid ; then 
rinsed and dried in the sun. 

To take Mildew out of Linen. 

Wash the linen well in warm water with soap ; then scrape some 
chalk very fine on it, and lay it on the grass in the sun ; as it dries, wet it 
a little. The mildew will come out after twice doing this. 

To take out Fruit Stains with Chloride of Soda. 

Wet first with cold soap and water, touch with chloride of soda. 
Wash again immediately. See also " Laundry," and its receipts. 

ORNAMENTATION. 

The taste of a lady is shown especially in the ornamentation of her 
apartments. 

The best ornaments (available for poor as well as rich) are flowers. 
They will enliven the dullest room, and bring nature and beauty into the 
heart of a smoky city. 

The power of arranging bouquets with taste and judgment is a gift not 
bestowed on everybody, but it may be in a great degree acquired by 
observation and care. The skilful grouping of colours is first to be con- 
sidered. Scarlet and white — i.e. scarlet geraniums with white cloves and 
jessamine — will be found very effective. The long wavy stems of the jessa- 
mine greatly relieving the flatness of the other flowers. 

Bouquets composed entirely of many-tinted roses are wonderfully 
lovely. A straw basket filled with roses and lilies {see plate) may be made 
a most charming ornament ; but some people cannot bear the strong per- 
fume of the tall lily — nor even that of lilies of the valley. 

Bouquets of set flowers, as zinnias, carnations, asters, should always 
have the centre raised with thin tapering flowers— as sweet-peas, jessa- 
mine, clematis, etc. 

A china bowl filled with roses is very pretty. 

Large soup-plates, or dishes filled with wet sand, will hold dahlia 
blossoms, and show them to great advantage. There are also tables

made for the purpose covered with a wire netting which, filled with 
dahlias, are very beautiful. 

A majolica vase, large enough and round enough to be filled with 
earth, may be planted with snowdrop bulbs round the edge, and filled in 
the centre with tulip-roots. These will bloom in spring, and form a 
charming and lasting bouquet. 

Tiny specimen glasses for rare flowers, containing a single magnolia, a 
choice rose, or new geranium, should stand about on the tables. 

The new glass half-rings for flowers are also well adapted for display- 
ing small flowers, such as yellow primroses, evening primroses, and violets 
in moss — all being put into wet sand. These may be formed into patterns 
in the rings {see plate) one half-circle of violets, the next of snowdrops, the 
next of yellow primroses, then heartsease, primulas, or nemophila. The 
interstices filled in with any rare bits of green and brown moss, with here 
and there a few scarlet blossoms. 

In winter the rings may be filled with moss, red berries of holly, hips 
or haws, and the yellow and white immortelles, Russian violets, and 
Christmas roses. They may be also arranged to look like a twisted 
wreath by placing them in curved lines {see plate). 

Tulips in tiny pots, placed in moss on one of the glass stands now 
sold for flowers, are pretty. Overhanging fern leaves give a grace to stiff 
bouquets, and are indeed always beautiful. 

In the centre of the annexed plate will also be seen a pretty orna- 
ment for a stand in summer. It is a glass stand with a deep bowl-like 
bottom, surrounded by a rim for flowers. In the bowl, water-lilies are 
laid ; on the second glass-round, which is nearly flat, other plants are 
placed ; on the flat glass top is placed a small block of ice crowned with, 
and surrounded by, violets. As the heat of the day melts the ice, it 
flows down on the flowers on the stands below, and gradually floats the 
water-lilies. The ice, of course, must be in exact proportion in size to the 
water which the lower bowl will contain. Placed on a table in the hall, 
this bouquet will produce a delightful freshness of the air round it. 

For a winter bouquet, nothing is prettier than crystallized twigs and 
evergreens, which sparkle in the light like diamonds. 

We give the following receipt for one of these bouquets : 

To Ice Evergreens. 

Dissolve alum by boiling in hard-water, in proportion of a pound to a 
quart. Pour it into a deep vessel, and as it cools the alum will be preci- 
pitated. Choose light sprays, and hang them with the stems upwards on 
cords stretched across the top of the vessel so that they do not touch 
the bottom ; they will attract the alum in the process of crystallization like 
the threads in sugar-candy. The warmer the solution when they are put in 
the smaller will be the crystals attached to them, but care must be taken 
that it be not hot enough to destroy the leaves or fronds ; and, if there be 
berries, like holly, it must be hardly lukewarm. The same solution 
warmed again will do two or three bouquets. 



56 Domestic Science. 



To Frost Leaves and Sprays. 

Purchase, at any glass manufactory; a few pennyworths of powdered 
glass, or powder some pieces of broken glass, by breaking or rolling them 
yourself ; but beware lest any chips of the glass get into your eyes (which 
should be covered with a gauze veil to protect them while you roll and 
pound the glass) ; dip the leaves and sprays in a thin gum-water ; then 
shake the powdered glass over them and let them dry. The effect is 
wonderful. 

To make Snownakes. 

Dip pieces of cotton-wool, the size of snow-flakes, into weak gum-water. 
Dust them over with glass-powder. These flakes are pretty for Christmas 
ornamentation of all kinds. 

Flowers should be gathered early in the morning, but not till the dew 
is nearly dried off them. They should be placed in a flat basket, or on a 
tray, so as not to press upon and crush each other, and they should be 
neatly cut, and not mangled or bruised. When thus gathered, they should 
be covered with a sheet of paper, and immediately conveyed to the apart' 
ment where they are to be used, if that apartment be near at hand. But if 
they are to be sent to any distance, they should be placed in tin cases, 
such as botanists use when collecting specimens. 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

We believe that the mother of a family might derive much assistance 
in her domestic rule, and might be a gainer in many ways, did she possess 
a knowledge of certain natural laws, and the consequences resulting from 
either violating or obeying them. It is surprising how little scientific 
knowledge is possessed by women ; yet it is most essential for the ruler of 
a small kingdom such as that of the family, to know the various awful 
powers of nature which affect life, health, or, at the very least, domestic 
comfort, and which are always acting in the midst of the dear circle of be- 
loved beings to whom she would fain be as a guardian angel. It is terrible 
to think that her ignorant love may be actually injuring those whom she 
would willingly die to serve ; yet such is too often the case. The follow- 
ing pages are meant to explain a few scientific matters which ought to be 
known to everybody. They will, we trust, be of service in showing the 
reason why certain things should be done or avoided, and also why so 
many circumstances occur to mar our home comfort in the most useless 
and foolish manner. 

Natural laws will be stated in plain and unscientific language. It is 
hoped that the subject may awaken sufficient interest in the minds of 
those readers to whom it may be in any way new, to induce them to study 
natural science in works devoted to it. 

We shall begin with the mighty power, without which our life itself 
would cease.

HEAT. 

Heat travels with light from the sun, but it can be produced by fric- 
tion — by percussion — by chemical action— by electrical action — by vital 
power. " Pouillet has carefully ascertained," says Professor Pepper, in his 
admirable " Cyclopaedic Science Simplified," " the total heating effect of 
the sun's rays upon the earth ; and estimating the whole heating power of 
the sun as 2300 millions of parts, he calculates that less than one of those 
parts only reaches our earth, and yet it would melt a layer of ice thirty-five 
yards thick over the whole surface of our globe. This proportion of heat 
is not all available : some of it is at once converted into power by setting 
the air in motion, to create the winds ; another portion raises the water of 
the ocean into vapour, which, descending in the form of rain on high 
levels, such as the mighty water-shed which supplies the great lakes (dis- 
covered by Speke and Grant and Sir Samuel Baker), which are the sources 
of the Nile, flows down to the lowlands, giving rise to water power, which is 
again the equivalent for heat. Another part stimulates and increases the 
growth of plants ; and thus in ages long since passed away, the heat of the 
sun's rays was not all lost, as the elder Stephenson insisted, but was stored 
up ready for man to use in another form — viz., coal. It was therefore called 
potential heat. The plants, being the food of animals, again contribute to 
the production of animal heat and muscular force. The sources of heat 
are all connected with motion of some kind. 

" Friction is a notable illustration, and it was by causing two pieces 
of ice to rub one against the other that Sir Humphry Davy gene- 
rated heat, and liquefied the ice. Like Dr. Young, who proved that light 
could turn a corner, and established by his experiments with inflection a 
sort of basis upon which the undulatory theory of light was again recon- 
structed, so this famous experiment of Davy supplied a great fact, and 
gave the first blow to the old theory which said that the ice melted because 
latent heat was made sensible heat, when it was well known that water at 
a temperature of 32 Fahrenheit contains much more heat than ice ; how, 
then, could the ice, already deficient in heat, supply enough to satisfy the 
condition of water ? There are plenty of illustrations of the generation of 
heat by friction. The flint and steel ; the attrition of dried wood, as used 
by savage tribes ; the famous experiments of Count Rumford whilst boring 
cannon, when enough heat was generated in two hours and a half to cause 
two and a half gallons of water to boil ; the friction of railway-wheel axles, 
which have been known to become red hot and to set fire to the woodwork 
of the carriage. In North America, a case is quoted where heat was 
intentionally generated by waste water power and used for heating pur- 
poses, the generator being two flat plates of iron which rubbed against 
each other. 

" Percussion .—It was said formerly that metals when struck with 
a hammer, or with a die in the coining-press, became hot because their 
density was increased, and therefore their capacity or containing power for 
heat was altered ; but it is clearly shown that this is not the true explana- 
tion. Lead, for instance, which becomes hot by percussion, does not 
increase in density and yet becomes hot — so hot that when projected from 



50 Domestic Science. 



the steam gun, in the form of bullets, against a wrought-iron target, a flash 
of light is apparent in a darkened room. The heavy shot used for batter- 
ing iron plates always becomes very hot after it has struck the plate. 

"Chemical Action. — The bringing together of a number of atoms, 
however small, the clashing together (as Tyndall calls it) of particles to 
produce new compounds, as in the heating and combustion of finely pow- 
dered antimony when it is brought in contact with chlorine gas ; or the 
heat generated by combustion or from other chemical changes, are all to 
be regarded as the result of motion which the eye cannot detect, but which 
must occur before the elements come in contact, combine, and form new 
compounds. There are many chemical changes accelerated by motion, 
and hence the stirring-rod is an important mechanical means to secure the 
more rapid union of particles. 

" Electrical action is, of course, circulation, or motion." 

Vital power is heat generated by chemical action — it is very slow 
combustion ; we call it animal heat, without the presence of which in our 
bodies life would cease. This heat is caused (in scientific language) by 
"the combustion or burning of hydrogen and carbon in the capillary 
vessels." 

The capillary vessels are vessels as small as hairs, from which they 
take their name : Capillaris is a Latin word meaning, " like a hair." These 
vessels run all over the body. We all know that wherever we prick or cut 
ourselves, blood will flow ; no part of the body is exempt from this flow of 
blood, even if it be but the speck covered by a pin-prick. The blood flows 
from these tiny vessels. The blood in them contains hydrogen gas and car- 
bon. By breathing we inhale (or ought to inhale) oxygen gas ; this gas com- 
bines with the carbon in our blood, and causes combustion or heat by 
forming carbonic acid gas. Thus a constant fire is kept up within the 
human body ; if it failed from want of food (which makes carbon), or 
from want of oxygen (pure air), we should perish. Animal heat is not very 
high, not hotter than 90 or 104 degrees ; nevertheless, it slowly consumes 
the body ; every muscle, nerve, organ is wasted away by it, and has 
to be perpetually renewed. The lamp of life requires to be constantly fed, 
just as an ordinary lamp requires to be supplied with oil, but the combus- 
tion in the former case (that of the animal) is much slower than in the case 
of the latter. 

Food is the fuel of the body ; when it is not supplied the capillary fires 
consume the human frame itself, while substance enough remains to keep 
them burning, and when that fails they expire. Life goes also, and the 
man is said to be starved to death. 

This is the reason that want of food causes shrinking of the body ; it 
is an actual wasting in the fire. The fat of the body, which is the most 
combustible part, goes first, and afterwards the muscles. The animal 
heat expires, and death comes to close the sufferings of starvation. 

The air, which acts so important a part in generating or causing 
animal heat, is composed principally of two gases, called oxygen and ni- 
trogen, unequally mixed ; it is composed of about one gallon of oxygen to 
four of nitrogen. It also contains small quantities of vapour of water, car- 
bonic acid, and ammonia. The word "gas" means air, but the atmosphere 
is a compound of two gases, as we have said. The oxygen in the air sustains 
life by keeping up the animal heat, and giving vitality to the blood. 



Domestic Science. 59 



We breathe it in (i.e. inhale it), and it mingles with our blood in the lungs, 
which it turns to a bright red colour. Blood before the oxygen meets it is 
a dark purple. 

This fact accounts for the pale cheeks and lips of people who breathe 
impure air, or air not quite fresh. Oxygen is the purest air ; if there is not 
enough in our share of the atmosphere, the blood cannot turn a beautiful 
red : therefore, dwellers in towns where the allowance of oxygen is 
small, are pale ; country folks who get plenty of oxygen are rosy and 
fresh-looking. 

The reason why oxygen turns the purple blood red, is this : — The 
colouring matter of the blood is formed of very minute globules floating in 
it, the oxygen uniting with the coats of these globules makes them milky- 
looking, and the dark colouring matter seen through this milky tinge 
appears of a bright red. 

Oxygen, as we have said before, causes combustion or heat by com- 
bining with the carbon which is the chief element in the blood, and thus 
sending warmth through all the capillary vessels. We swallow, of course, 
the mixture of nitrogen and oxygen of which the air is composed ; but 
after we have absorbed the oxygen into the blood in the lungs, we breathe 
back carbonic acid which mixes with the air. 

Thus the air breathed in houses and rooms is rendered impure — that 
is, full of carbonic acid — and requires to be constantly renewed fresh 
from the outside air or atmosphere. The reason why the atmo- 
sphere or whole body of the air is not gradually rendered bad by human 
beings thus absorbing the oxygen, is because the under surface of vege- 
table leaves gives out oxygen as long as it is daylight, and thus preserves 
the due proportion of oxygen and nitrogen in the air.* But you will say, 
where do the plants get this oxygen ? Partly from the atmosphere, also from 
the earth which contains carbonic acid gas — that is, carbon and oxygen 
mixed — derived from the air through drops of rain. From the decay of 
vegetable and animal matter, and from the stones, which are full of 
carbonic acid in a solid state, the roots of trees and vegetables 
draw up, by capillary attraction,t this carbonic acid from the earth into 
their sap ; they keep for themselves (for the formation of wood) the car- 
bon, and return the oxygen from the under surface of their leaves to the 
atmosphere. 

Thus God has made animal life to depend on vegetable life ; for unless 
the plants returned to the air enough oxygen to supply the loss caused by 
our consumption of it, the atmosphere could not supply us with the 
breath of life. 

But if we are so much indebted to the vegetable world, it also is de- 



* The great currents of air circulating from the equator to the poles, and from 
the poles to the equator, also preserve the purity of the atmosphere, and keep up 
life by supplying the plants with carbonic acid borne from fully populated regions, 
and the populated regions with oxygen from the plants of little-inhabited lands. 
The fall of rain also washes impurities from the atmosphere. 

+ Capillary attraction is the power which very minute tubes possess of making a 
liquid rise in them above its own level. The smaller the tube the higher the 
liquid will be attracted up it,

pendent upon us. The plants, as we have said, require carbonic acid for 
their nourishment ; now animals all exhale carbonic acid into the air, 
and thus supply the plants with it, in return for the oxygen which vegeta- 
tion gives out. Thus all things are linked together in the golden chain of 
reciprocal benefits. 

This carbonic acid gas is a foe to animal life if inhaled. It is the most 
deadly of poisons. It was the cause of the death of the British prisoners 
in the Black Hole of Calcutta ; as choke-damp it causes death sometimes 
in mines or deep wells, and even if inhaled slightly in the impure air of 
a heated or crowded room or church, it is dangerous to health. It is 
a narcotic poison, and its presence may be divined by a sense of drowsi- 
ness and lassitude. We have said much about it already in our former 
passages on Ventilation. 

No fire will live in an atmosphere of carbonic acid ; therefore candles 
let down into wells and placed in suspected rooms, are sure tests of the air. 
Where a candle will not burn a man cannot live. Fire {i.e., combustion) 
depends, you remember, on the union of carbon, or charcoal, and oxygen ; 
if there is no oxygen there can be no fire. 

You will perhaps wonder why there should be so much nitrogen (or 
bad air as we call it) mixed with the oxygen of the atmosphere. It is 
meant to dilute the oxygen, which has such great powers of combustion, 
that if it were not thus mixed, and weakened or diluted with nitrogen, it 
would quickly exhaust our lives by burning us up with animal heat. 

We think these few hints will show the mother of a family the need of 
keeping the air of her house pure ; and the benefit of " green leaves," which 
are not only ornamental, but useful in feeding the flame of life, Dear 
housemother, let your little ones, if you live in a town, have green plants 
and flowers in their nurseries, and walk in the parks near the life-feeding 
trees. 

The necessity of being much in the open air will be made apparent by 
these facts. 

" Recent researches, especially those of Professor Mantegazza, com- 
municated during the year to the Institute of Lombardy, would seem to 
show that the ancients, after all, were by no means following merely 
imaginative or superstitious speculations in the practice they adopted of 
attempting, by the free use of odoriferous substances, to guard themselves 
against the attack of infectious diseases. This subject was deemed of 
sufficient importance to be referred to in the opening remarks of the pre- 
siding chairman of the public health section of the recent British Medical 
Association, as one deserving of careful study. Whether we shall, 
however, ever recur to the practice of Acron of Agrigentum, and other 
followers of Empedocles, the physicist, who not only used aromatic and 
balsamic herbs as preventives of pestilence, oftentimes planting them in 
abundance, for that purpose, round their cities, or adopt a similar course 
to that followed in a plague that once devastated Italy, when, acting on 
the advice of the faculty of the day, strangers crowding into Rome re- 
treated to Lauretum, now San Lorenzo, that by a cooler atmosphere and 
by the odour of laurel they might escape the chance of infection, we 
cannot pretend to say. But it would really seem that we may, with in- 
creased confidence, rely upon our camphor bags, our lavender bundles, 
and the like, for Mantegazza says that in the oxidation of the essences ot 



Domestic Science. 61 



odoriferous plants a large quantity of ozone* is evolved, at least as much 
as is generated by electricity or phosphorus ; the ozone being developed 
by the direct action of the sun's rays, and in some cases, whilst this com- 
mences in solar light, it continues in the dark. The plants -which give 
ozone most readily are cherry-laurel, clove, and lavender, among herbs ; the 
narcissus, hyacinth, and mignonette, and amongst perfumes eau-de- 
Cologne, oil of bergamot, and certain aromatic tinctures. The cultiva- 
tion of herbs and odorous flowers ' in marshy districts and in places 
infected with animal emanations/ is the advice which Mantegazza gives 
to those who pin any faith to his experiments. Verily, if Apollo the 
Healer, by his life-inspiring and health-restoring ways, can draw from the 
fairest flowers of nature so mysterious and yet so mighty a purifier, there 
is hope for the slums and pest-stricken nooks of our towns and cities, and 
so grateful and attractive a mode of disinfection will surely soon become 
universal." 

We cannot leave the subject of air without pointing out the danger 
of a charcoal fire. — Charcoal is carbon ; when burning, it readily unites 



* Ozone. — Although oxygen has never been changed from the gaseous state 
to a liquid or solid condition, it seems to be capable of assuming a peculiar con- 
densed form called Ozone, — a word taken from the Greek o£w, to give out an 
odour. 

MM. de Babo, Claus, and Soret all maintain that ozone is oxygen denser than 
common oxygen gas. The latter philosopher especially declared that ozone as a 
molecule consisted of three atoms of oxygen, and he therefore called it binoxide of 
oxygen. M. Soret, in continuation of his researches on the density of ozone, and 
employing the absorptive powers of essences of turpentine and cinnamon, has come 
to the conclusion that the density of ozone is I \ times that of oxygen. Other learned 
chemists appear to concur in this opinion. 

Ozone is produced in various ways. 

1. By passing a series of electrical discharges — silent ones — through dry oxygen 
gas ; the latter diminishes in bulk to the extent of one-twelfth, showing condensa- 
tion ; and if subsequently heated to a temperature of 550 F., recovers its former 
bulk and loses its peculiar ozone qualities. The reason the electrical discharge 
should be a silent one is because the electrical spark produces too much heat, 
which destroys a considerable portion of the ozone, and thus prevents any con- 
siderable accumulation. 

2. This peculiar condition of oxygen is obtained by acting either on potassium 
permanganate, or upon baric dioxide with strong sulphuric acid. 

3. A stick of phosphorus scraped clean under water, and then exposed in a 
bottle containing moist air, produces ozone. 

4. When water is decomposed in the apparatus called a voltameter, the mixed 
gases give the peculiar odour, and are found to contain a certain quantity of 
ozone. 

It is known that sea-air contains ozone, whilst the same air, having passed 
over or through a town, is supposed to be deprived in a great degree of this agent, 
which is considered to have purifying and health-giving powers. The absence of 
ozone from the air is said to be prejudicial to health, and during the prevalence of 
cholera it was thought to be due in some degree to the absence of this condition of 
oxygen. 

Ozone was first discovered by Van Marum in 1785 ; but it was not till 
Schonbein experimented upon it, in 1840, that it received its name. 



62 Domestic Science. 



with the oxygen of the air and forms the deadly carbonic acid. If a 
charcoal fire be shut into a bedroom, it will deposit this poisonous gas at 
the bottom of the room, and as all gases diffuse themselves through each 
other — just as wine will through water — it will gradually permeate the air 
of the chamber, and a person sleeping in it for six hours would probably 
never wake again. He would be suffocated. 

We must guard carefully in our houses against the presence of this 
insidious foe. As the breath of animals, and combustion of any kind 
create it, we should frequently renew the air, by letting the carbonic gas 
escape from our rooms and admitting the fresh out-door atmosphere. The 
decay of animal or vegetable matter causes it also. Our dust bins there- 
fore require attention ; the contents should not be let accumulate, or if 
they cannot be frequently cleared out, fresh slaked lime must be thrown 
into them, which will absorb the carbonic acid, and render it harmless. 

As oxygen creates the animal heat which is life, but which also 
consumes the body, it follows that very pure air by increasing combustion 
will create appetite — hunger being the craving of the human frame for 
fuel to supply the hourly consumption. Therefore good air will give a good 
appetite. Exercise, also, increases animal heat, by causing man to con- 
sume more oxygen than when he is still and sedentary, for in exercise the 
respiration is quicker, and more air is inhaled. The heat in the capillary 
vessels is acted on by running, jumping, etc., as a fire is by a pair of 
bellows. 

Hard work, reading aloud, singing — all increase combustion by intro- 
ducing a larger amount of oxygen into the lungs, and cause the persons 
working, reading, or singing, to require food to sustain the waste of the 
frame. 

In sleep we breathe more slowly than when awake, consequently we re- 
quire no food during the hours of the night (if we slumber), for less oxygen is 
introduced into the lungs, and our food-fuel consumes slowly till we 
wake. 

Want of exercise and over-feeding produce over-fat and ill-health, be- 
cause more hydrogen and carbon are taken into the blood than can be 
consumed by respiration. These, therefore — remaining unburnt up — turn 
to superfluous fat, or cause disease. 

In cold weather flesh-food and fatty matters are required, because 
they contain more carbon and hydrogen, which when burned in the 
blood produce a larger amount of heat than any other kind of food. 
Hence the inhabitants of the Arctic regions eat train oil, whale blubber, 
etc. And in winter it is well to supply a fuller meat and fattier diet than 
in summer heat. In cold weather more food is required, to keep up the 
animal heat, because the air contains more oxygen than in warm weather, 
and therefore burns up the food more fiercely ; besides which we are 
generally more active and our faster respiration fans the heat in the blood 
and consumes the fuel faster. 

In summer we naturally dislike animal food, because the carbon and 
hydrogen in it make us too hot ; — we prefer fruit and vegetables, for 
they contain less carbon and hydrogen than meat, and also a very large 
amount of water, and therefore produce less blood, and are not of so com- 
bustible a nature. On this account the natives of tropical climates, by 
a wise instinct, live on rice and fruit or vegetables. 



The Thermometer. 63 



The frequent use of baths tends to improve health and appetite in 
consequence of their freeing the pores of the body from obstruction, and 
thus promoting combustion. Ventilation, also, increases combustion by 
means of the introduction of more oxygen to the house. Therefore the 
badly-fed poor are instinctively averse to washing and to pure air, both of 
which increase hunger by diminishing warmth. 

The cold-blooded animals — frogs, fishes, snails, lizards, etc. — have cold 
blood because they consume very little air ; without a plentiful inhaling of 
which combustion is slow and animal heat small. 

But while carbonic acid, when inhaled, is so injurious, it is, in creation, 
an agent of great good. In water it is beneficial to us ; vegetation would 
perish without it, and chalk could not be formed without carbonic acid. 
There is nothing in nature which does not in some way tend to good. 

"When we consume wood and coal in our fires, or bread and wine in 
our bodies," says Dr. Odling, " we merely effect a combination whereby 
their potential is converted into actual energy ; this potential energy* 
having been stored up in them at the period of their formation, this energy 
being, in fact, the robbing of the sun's rays, and the storing up the heat of 
these rays in these articles of fire fuel. Under the action of the sun's 
rays the decomposition is effected of the carbonic acid and water into 
oxygen gas restored to the atmosphere, and of carbon-hydrogen, which is 
accumulated in the vegetable tissue. When we burn these tissues in our 
fires or bodies, we are simply restoring, in the form of actual energy, the 
potential heat of the sun's rays or its mechanical equivalent. We have all 
read of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme who had been talking prose all his life 
without knowing it. We have all our lives, and some of us without know- 
ing it, been realizing that celebrated problem of extracting sunbeams from 
cucumbers." 

This mighty agent of Life possesses also tremendous power in other 
respects. In can overcome the power of cohesion — that is, the attraction 
which by drawing particles of matter together makes bodies solid. Heat will 
rend these atoms asunder and change solids into liquids, liquids into 
vapour, and expand even the air itself, and the fine gases to a marvellous 
extent. We are all aware how heat expands our bodies in hot summer 
weather ; how furniture expands in the day, and contracting at night by 
the colder atmosphere, makes night hideous to a wakeful person by divers 
mysterious cracks and sounds which have no apparent cause. It is the 
expansion of heat which bursts a roasting chestnut if an opening has not 
been made in the skin or shell, and which causes breakages of glass and 
china from hot water being poured into them. 

Liquids expand still more readily with heat — some fluids expand more 
than others. 

THE THERMOMETER. 

The expansion of liquids by heat has been used in the formation of 
the Thermometer, or heat (thermo) measure (meter). 

Quicksilver, though a solid metal at the North Pole, is a liquid, and 
can be poured out like water in our climate. It is nearly fourteen times 
as heavy as water. 

* Potential energy used to be called " latent heat."

The Thermometer. 



It is used for thermometers instead of spirits of wine, because it bears a 
greater degree of heat before it boils. The instrument is made in the fol- 
lowing manner : — 

A glass tube with a small bore, sufficiently so to be capillary, is selected 
with care, in order to secure the same diameter throughout. The bores of 
some tubes are like an elongated cone, and, if they 
were used, the mercury would expand much more 
in some parts of the tube than in others, and hence 
the indications of such a thermometer would be in- 
correct. A little mercury, amounting to an inch in 
length, is allowed to enter the tube, and being 
moved from one end of the tube to the other, it is 
soon discovered whether the mercury increases or 
decreases in length, or remains, as is usually the 
case, of the same linear dimensions in all parts. 
The proper length having been cut off, one end is 
melted and blown out into a bulb, the other being 
formed into a cup or funnel-shaped form, to hold 
the mercury, which is forced in ; the tube is now 
inclined slightly, and the air in the bulb expanded 
by heat ; it is afterwards allowed to cool, and, as 
the air cools and contracts, the mercury from the 
upper funnel is forced in by the pressure of the air, 
and enters to supply the place of the air driven out 
by expansion. To get rid of the rest of the air, the 
mercury is alternately boiled and cooled until the 
bulb and part of the tube are full of mercury. 

Having thus filled the bulb and one-third of the 
tube, the next step is to seal it hermetically, which 
is done by heating the mercury to the boiling-point, 
and at the moment the mercury is overflowing at the 
summit the glass is fused with a flame, urged by a 
blow-pipe before the mercury has had time to contract ; and if this opera- 
tion has been skilfully performed, a perfectly void space or vacuum, free 
from air., is obtained as the mercury sinks or contracts in the bulb and 
tube. 

The marks on the thermometer are made by means of melting ice and 
boiling water. Ice always melts at the same temperature, and pure water 
invariably boils at the same temperature, when the barometer stands at 
29*8 in. 

It is only necessary to immerse the thermometer alternately in melting 
ice and in boiling water, with certain precautions, and to mark the point 
at which the mercurial column stands — one being called the freezing-point, 
and the other the boiling-point. 

The instrument must be immersed in the melting ice until the mercury 
becomes perfectly stationary. The immersion in boiling water requires 
the greatest care, and a time should be selected when the barometer stands 
at 29*8 or 30 inches. The depth of the water in the vessel should not ex- 
ceed two inches. The vessel must not be a shallow one, but sufficiently 
deep to contain the bulb and nearly all that part of the tube up which the 
mercury will rise. When placed in boiling water, distilled water should be

expresses slight variations of temperature better, therefore it is preferable ; 
the degrees on the " Centigrade » being too large to express minute diffe- 
rences. 

COMMUNICATION OF HEAT. 

Heat is communicated from one body to another by Conduction, 
Absorption, Reflection, Radiation, and Convection. 

Conduction means the communication of heat from one body to 
another by contact. Some bodies conduct heat well ; others are bad con- 
ductors. The best are the metals — lead being inferior to the rest. Light 
and porous bodies are bad conductors of heat, as hair, fur, wool, eider- 
down, cotton, wood, air, water, and snow. Our readers will see in these 
facts the scientific reason for many of our ordinary practices. Everything 
which conducts heat/;vw us, must necessarily render us colder ; bad con- 
ductors on the contrary keep us warm, because they do not rob us of our 
warmth to transfer it to other objects. Therefore, in winter, when we 
desire to keep as much heat to ourselves as we can, we dress in woollens 
and furs, because wool and fur are bad conductors, and will not suffer the 
warmth of our body to be drawn off by the cold air. Wool and fur do not 
give out warmth to us from themselves, they simply preserve our own 
natural heat from escaping into the air, which would otherwise gradually 
draw it away from us till both it and our body were of the same tempe- 
rature. For this reason God has clothed his dumb creatures with hair and 
wool, down and feathers, which, being bad conductors, serve to keep 
them warm. Fur, hair, and feathers are bad conductors of heat because 
the air (which is happily also a very bad conductor) gets amongst their 
fibres, and thus in a manner defends the creatures covered by them from 
itself. It may be asked, why, if the air be a bad conductor of heat, it 
should deprive any part of our bodies exposed to it of warmth, and make 
us require clothing ? The reason is that the air is ever moving and chang- 
ing ; the particles which pass over our skin deprive us of but a small 
amount of heat at a time, but they move off, and fresh cold ones instantly 
supply their place, and thus we are continually warming fresh particles of 
air, to our own loss of temperature. 

The act of warming particles of air by conveying to them our own 
heat, and thus growing colder ourselves, is the reason why a fan or punkah 
is a relief in warm weather. By agitating the air, we constantly bring 
fresh cold particles to be warmed by us, and thus bestow on them our 
superfluous warmth and become ourselves cooler. 

We said just now that happily air is a bad conductor of heat. If it 
were as good a conductor as metal, it would draw the heat from our body 
so quickly, that we should die of cold. Hot air too would parch and burn 
us up if it conducted heat as metal does, but fortunately it conveys heat 
to us as slowly as it takes it away. 

The earth is also a bad conductor of heat ; the surface may be 
scorched, but intense heat cannot reach the roots of the trees, neither

can cold, in the shape of frost, penetrate more than a few inches beneath 
the surface. Creative wisdom is shown in this, for if the earth were a 
good conductor, vegetation would perish ; springs of water would be dried 
up in summer by heat, and in winter frozen hard. 

The kettle-holder made of wool, the pieces of ivory which break the 
metallic communication between the good-conducting silver teapot and it? 
handle, and the soot — charcoal — covering the bottom of a kettle, which 
allows the vessel to be taken direct from the fire and held, though full ot 
boiling water, are good and familiar examples of the application of bad 
conductors. 

Snow is a very bad conductor. Its protecting veil consequently defends 
vegetation from cold and frost, by keeping in the warmth of the earth. 

The earth also is a bad conductor ; for this reason, the water of a 
spring is cool in the hottest weather. 

The reason that the earth is a bad conductor is that its particles are not 
continuous. Heat is conducted best by continuity of matter. 

Linen is a good conductor of heat ; it therefore draws the animal 
warmth off rapidly, and produces a sensation of chill. Cotton is warmer 
wear, because it is not so good a conductor as linen. Silk is warm wear 
also, because it is a bad conductor ; raw silk, a very bad conductor, is 
even a warmer clothing than wool. 

The metals are excellent conductors of heat. The iron of stoves con- 
ducts the heat of the fire to the air, and thus warms a room. Our readers 
are, doubtless, aware how hot the handle of a metal teapot will become 
from the same reason. 

The absorption of heat means the sucking in instead of diffusing it. 
Every good conductor of heat is therefore a bad absorber of it. 

The power of absorbing heat depends on the nature of the surface of a 
body ; bright and polished surfaces will not absorb heat as well as black 
or rough ones do. This is the reason why a kettle, the bottom and back 
of which are covered with soot, boils much quicker than a bright new one 
would — for polished metal reflects heat instead of absorbing it ; and on 
this account brilliant tin reflectors, such as plate-warmers, or meat-screens, 
are used. 

" The absorptive power," says Professor Pepper, " was supposed to de- 
pend greatly upon the particular colour used. Franklin placed pieces of 
coloured cloth in the sun's rays on the snow, and found they sank into the 
snow or melted it in the following order — black, blue, green, purple, red, 
yellow, white. Tyndall, however, has explained the cause more correctly, 
and has discovered that the colour has not so much to do with the effect pro- 
duced as the nature of the material used for the colouring agent. Although 
it has been stated by Leslie that white surfaces generally reflect heat well, 
and absorb it indifferently, there is the curious fact, ascertained by Mel- 
loni, that white lead has quite as great an absorbent power as lampblack ; 
and if the heat comes from boiling water it will absorb twice as much as 
it would do if it came from an incandescent platinum wire." 

Nevertheless colours undoubtedly do affect the heat or coolness of our 
dress. We think everybody will allow that a black dress in summer is 
much warmer than a white one, irrespective of its effect on the sight, to 
which colours appear certainly either warm or cool. Every one is sensible 
of the heat and glare of scarlet, and of the coolness of green and blue to 
his eye in the furniture of rooms or in dress. 



68 Communication of Heat. 



Professor Pepper adds, "Leslie's principle does apply to clothing, 
and it appears that if we imitate nature, and, like the Polar bear, wear 
white, we shall be warmer in winter and cooler in summer." 

The power of black to absorb heat was tested by a friend of our own, 
in his fruit garden. He had the wall behind an apricot tree painted black 
for one half of the tree, leaving the other side of unpainted bricks. The 
apricots on the black side were ripe before the others. 

Reflection of heat is heat thrown back from polished and bright 
surfaces ; as from a meat-screen ; but if the screen be scratched, painted, 
or dull, it will not reflect or cast back the heat it receives from the fire. 
Polished boots are cooler than dusty ones from the same cause ; a dusty 
boot absorbs heat. 

Polished metals will conduct heat by contact. If a bright steel poker 
be kept in a hot fire, it will conduct heat ; if it were lying in the fender, it 
would reflect it. 

Heat is radiated from one body to another when a non-conducting 
medium separates them. A fire radiates heat, the burning fuel emitting 
rays which warm us when near them. Dull and dark substances are 
radiators : light and polished substances radiate badly ; therefore stoves 
are cleaned with blacklead, which radiates heat better than any other 
known object. 

Bodies which are bad radiators preserve the heat within them. Polished 
metal is a bad radiator, therefore teapots are made of it, because as it 
does not radiate well, it keeps the heat of the tea in. Polished metal also 
keeps cold in it. Hot water will keep hot longest in a metal jug, and cold 
water (in hot weather) will keep cold longer in one. This fact accounts 
for the use of tin cans and jugs for bringing hot water to bedrooms. 
Very brightly polished dish-covers being bad radiators, do not suffer the 
heat of dishes to escape by radiation, but as polish is essential for non- 
radiation, the same covers if suffered to become dull, scratched, or dirty, 
will only badly fulfil the purpose for which they are designed. 

Convection of heat, means heat communicated by being carried to 
another thing, or place. Water is made hot by convection. 

Air also (being like water, a bad conductor) is heated by convection. 

Water and air both ascend when heated. The water at the bottom of 
a pot or boiler, and the air nearest to the fire, will both become hot first 
and then rise. The colder water or air above then descends, but when 
heated ascends in its turn ; thus the whole air in a room, or the whole 
body of water in a vessel is gradually heated by convection. 

The general atmosphere is also heated by convection. The sun (which 
does not heat the air) heats the earth ; the earth heats the air resting on 
it. This heated air, called " a convective current," rises, and carries heat 
with it. Colder air takes its place, and is warmed and ascends in its 
turn. 

Fire — our best servant and worst enemy, as the old proverb calls it, 
is heat and light produced by combustion of inflammable substances, 
which separate from each other by chemical action, and combine with the 
oxygen in the air. 

Fuel contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, with certain mineral sub- 
stances. Carbon is the solid part of fuel — charcoal is carbon, so are 
lampblack, coke, and diamonds ! Hydrogen is an inflammable gas ; 
carburetted hydrogen is burned in the lamps in our streets and houses as 



Fire. 69 

common gas. It is the lightest substance known ; it burns the moment it 
is ignited, and will, if a light reaches it, explode should there not be enough 
atmospheric air in the room to render it innocuous. Happily its unpleasant 
odour is a warning of its presence, which should never be unheeded. 

Oxygen is the pure air which gives life. Nitrogen is an invisible gas 
which will not burn, will not help combustion, and is as deadly as carbonic 
acid gas. Now three of these elements are employed in making every 
common fire — i.e., hydrogen gas, carbon, and oxygen; the two former in 
the fuel, the latter in the air. 

The hydrogen is set free by the match, and uniting with the oxygen of 
the air makes a flame, the flame heats the carbon of the fuel, which also 
unites with the oxygen and produces carbonic acid gas. 

Fire gives forth warmth by liberating latent heat from the air and the 
fuel. Carbon requires a great deal of heat to make it unite with the oxygen 
of the air, in consequence of which the fire kindles gradually. A blazing 
fire burns the fuel quickest, because the inflammable gases then escaping 
help combustion. A clear, bright fire is more economical, for it burns 
more slowly, and there is very little smoke with a red hot fire, much less 
than with one partially black, because the entire surface of the coals being 
in a state of combustion, very little of the escaping carbon remains uncon- 
sumed to fly off as soot. Smoke is unconsumed matters separated from 
the fuel, consisting of minute pieces of carbon, gaseous exhalations, and 
vapour. It is, we know, possible to consume smoke. 

Fresh coals increase smoke, because more carbon and volatile parti- 
cles are separated from the fuel than can be reduced by combustion, and 
consequently they fly off in smoke. 

The combustion of a fire is very unequal, because the air reaches it in 
varied currents. The various shades of red, yellow, and white heat, showing 
the different degrees of combustion, mingled with the unburnt coal, pro- 
duce the fanciful resemblances we call " faces in the fire." 

Coals burn out faster on a frosty day than on a warm one, because the 
cold condenses the air and thus produces more oxygen ; colder air makes 
the fire burn more intensely. 

Our readers are probably well aware that the rays of the sun falling on 
a fire will often put it out. The reason is, that the solar rays are composed 
of three parts — lighting, heating, and actinic or chemical rays. The two 
latter interfere with combustion. 

Fires " go out " in summer, not only because less attention is paid to 
them, but because the hot and rarefied air of summer has its oxygen dif- 
fused through a greater space. On damp days, also, fires do not burn 
well because the air is full of vapour and is too much rarefied. In windy 
weather, when the air is rapidly changed, plenty of oxygen is supplied, and 
the fire will burn fiercely. For the same reason, a pair of bellows helps to 
kindle, or get a fire up, by driving the oxygen rapidly into it. 

When coals are small and dusty it is well to sprinkle them with water, 
this cakes them and the steam generated assists to heat them into com- 
bustion ; a little water, in fact, makes a fire burn more fiercely, because it 
is readily converted into steam, which increases heat. A large quantity of 
water extinguishes fire because it cannot be converted instantly into steam. 

From these facts we may learn an important lesson. In cases of fire, a 
little water employed to extinguish it is worse than no water at all, as it 



70 Smoky Chimneys. 



increases the intensity of the fire instead of quenching it ; a supply, rapid 
and abundant, which cannot be converted into steam, is required. 

Smoke ascends the chimney, unless for our misery the flue smokes ; it 
is carried up by the air, which, passing over the fire gets heated, becomes 
of course lighter, and flies up the chimney carrying the unconsumed par- 
ticles of carbon with it ; for, as we have said, warm air, expanded (as all 
things are) by heat, always ascends, the cold and heavier air sinks. This 
cold air presses the lighter (heated) air up the chimney. 

We come now to the vexed question of smoky chimneys. There are, 
of course, scientific reasons for them. If fresh air is not let into the room 
as fast as it is consumed by the fire, a current of air comes down the 
chimney to supply the deficiency, and drives the smoke before it. This is 
one cause. 

Again, if the funnel of the chimney— that is, the part up which the 
smoke goes — be very short, it will smoke, because the draught of a short 
flue is too slack to carry the smoke up the chimney. The longer the flue, 
the greater the draught ; hence the use of chimney-pots, 

Houses in valleys often smoke, because the wind striking against the 
hills, returns to the chimney and destroys its draught. 

If the fireplace and the door are on the same side of the room, the 
chimney will be apt to smoke, because the current of air from the door 
will blow obliquely to the fireplace and drive the smoke into the room. It 
is best, if possible, for the room door to be opposite to the fireplace. Too 
large an opening of the fireplace, as in farm-houses and kitchens, will a.so 
cause smoke, because much of the air which goes up the chimney has never 
been over the fire, and this cold air chills the ascending hot air and 
checks its ascent. Contracting the space, or fixing a blower is the best 
remedy : a blower increases the draught by compelling the air to pass 
through the fire, and thus makes it so much hotter that it ascends more 
rapidly. 

Such are some of the causes of smoky chimneys ; we may add obstruc- 
tions by soot, bricks' out of the chimney and chinks which admit cold air ; 
in short the management of the draught is the great thing in almost every 
case. Air must be supplied to the fire, and all contrivances to keep it out 
of the room, such as list or Indian-rubber round doors, sandbags, etc., are 
likely to make a chimney smoke. The draught of air from the door or 
window always sets towards the fireplace ; a bed, chair, or sofa placed 
between them would be in a draught. 

Cure for Smoky Chimneys. — Inflate a large ox-bladder with air, 
and tie it by the neck to the middle of a stick, which place across the inside 
of a chimney, about two feet from the top, or at the foot of the chimney- 
top. The buoyancy of the air keeps the bladder continually in a circular 
motion, and thereby prevents the rush of air into the funnel from descend- 
ing so low as the fireplace. 

The grate should be fixed near the floor of the room, as the heat of the 
fire has very little effect on the air below the level of the grate. A poker 
b.id across a dull fire will revive it, because the metal concentrates the 
heat and throws it on the fire, and air being drawn between the poker and 
the coals a slight draught is created. 

In every occupied room there are two currents of air — one of hot air 
flowing out of the loom, the other of cold air flowing into the room. The 



Making up a Fire. 7 1 



hot air escapes by the crevice at the top of the door, the cold air enters at 
the bottom.* But this is not the case when a fire is lighted in the room ; 
an inward current is then drawn through all the crevices, and the heated 
air escapes up the chimney. 

Professor Faraday has well explained the advantages of the open coal 
£re and chimney in comparison with the stove and flue. A parlour grate 
will consume forty pounds of coal in twelve hours ; the combustion of this 
quantity of fuel renders 42,000 gallons of air unfit to breathe. But the 
chimney clears us of all this bad air which ascends it, while Jive times that 
quantity of air is carried up with it by the draught, and thus good venti- 
lation is obtained by means of our ordinary fires. 

If the combustion of the coals were perfect, we should have neither 
soot nor smoke. Dr. Arnott's patent stove was constructed that the com- 
bustion might be perfect. In a common fire it is estimated that five-sixths 
of the heat passes up the chimney. 

The principle of the Arnott stove may be carried out by lighting a fire 
from the top. Here are instructions given for the arranging it, taken from 
the Builder : — 

" Clean out your grate ; cover the bottom with a sheet of paper cut out 
or folded to fit ; place coals in the grate to the level of the top bar, keeping 
the larger ones to the front, to prevent waste. Light your fire on the top 
and allow it to burn downwards undisturbed. An ordinary fire prepared 
and lighted in this way will, according to the size and form of the grate, 
burn six, eight, or ten hours without any renewal of coal, burning brighter 
and warmer than if lighted from below, as fires are ordinarily made. The 
coal should be tolerably equal in size, something like McAdam stone ; 
place the large to the front, the small to the back. The paper is put in 
the grate to prevent any air rising through the bottom bars. The fire is 
lighted on the topt and made to burn downwards to prevent rapid com- 
bustion, and to keep the heat on the surface of the coals, cinders, or coke ; 
and if undisturbed, the combustion will be so complete that there will be 
no waste ashes. The grate must be cleaned each morning, and the paper 
must be renewed on the bottom of the grate when the fire reaches the 
lower layer of coal." 

This fire is very advisable for a chimney which is incurably smoky ; 
but though economical and clean, it lacks the bright sparkle and blaze of 
the old-fashioned fire. 

A very good plan also, is to make a hollow at the back of the fire, 
before fresh coals are put on, and fill it in first with the cinders under the 
grate. Place the fresh coals on these cinders, and the gas given out by 
the coals will be consumed by them, and the smoke also. This is a very 
old-fashioned mode of making up a fire ; the reason why it answered well 
was probably unknown to the housewives of other days, but their practical 
knowledge told them that this was the right way. 

It should ever be borne in mind that fire cannot exist without air, and 
will not spread rapidly unless it is plentifully supplied with it. Therefore in 
pses of fire catching the furniture, etc., in a room, close all the doors and

windows instantly, while every effort is made to extinguish it. In case of 
the dress catching fire, the same truth should be borne in mind. Never 
run out into the air. Running increases the flame by fanning it. Lie 
down and roll over and over on the ground, if you are alone ; at all events 
lie down, aflame ascends, and will therefore not be so likely to injure the 
head or vital parts if the person on fire is lying down. But if possible roll 
yourself in a blanket, or the rug, or a table cover at once. The moment 
all air is shut off from fire it will go out. Remember also, that as heated 
air and vapour ascend, and cold air sinks, you will always (in the midst 
of most suffocating smoke) find air fit to breathe within a foot of the floor ; 
XRAWL therefore rather than walk in escaping from a room full of smoke ; 
a piece of flannel over the mouth would also enable you to breathe. 

LIGHT. 

LIGHT is supposed to be communicated and produced by the vibratory 
motion of a subtle and delicate ether, but it is believed that further dis- 
coveries may be made on the subject hereafter. 

" Starting with the proposition," says Professor Pepper, " that all 
sources of light and luminous bodies, like musical instruments, must first 
vibrate, it is not difficult to understand by analogy, how these vibrations 
may travel at the rate of 182,000 miles per second, in straight lines called 
rays. 

" A tuning-fork emitting sound might by analogy represent a source of 




A, tuning-fork struck on the leaden cone B, capped with leather, and 
applied to the end of the rod c, whilst the other end is held against the 
sounding- board D. 



light like the sun, whilst a long rod communicating with it would stand in 
the place of the theoretical ether, propagating the undulations from the 
sun through a space of 924 millions of miles, and if the other end of the 
rod communicates with the sounding-board of a guitar, the audible sound 
obtained might compare with the light falling on the earth, and becoming 
apparent by radiation. 

"The conversion of a continued series of mechanical impulses into waves 
is beautifully shown by taking hold of the end of a long vulcanized india- 
rubber tube filled with sand, and having attached one end to the ceiling or 
•Mdier convenient place, it is easy by a jerk to produce the appearance of a

wave, which travels distinctly from the hand to the ceiling ; at the same 

time it demonstrates the pro- 
gressive nature of the wave 

or undulation, and as the 

portion held by the operator 

cannot move from his hand 

to the ceiling, it shows how 

the eye is deceived whilst 

looking at the motion of 

waves of water. Every wave 

in water is propagated by the 

rising and falling of that 

which has preceded it, and 

not because the volume of 

water representing the wave 

travels bodily from the spot 

where it is first noticed to 

the shore where it breaks. 
" Dr. Tyndall has shown, 

by a modification of Dr. 

Young's experiments with 

vibrating strings upon which 

light is thrown, a number of 

very beautiful effects. A sil- 
vered cord attached to the 

iron arm of a curved spring 

band, one end of which is 

made to vibrate by an electro-magnet, displays the divisions of the cords 

into wave-like figures most perfectly when the cord is illuminated by the 

lime or, better still, the electric light. 

" Using the brilliant light as before, a still more perfect and admirable 

experiment may be conducted by attaching one end of a bright silvered 

chain to a hook screwed into a vertical whirling table, and the other to a 

proper stand. The chain being horizontal and the wheel vertical, it may 

be swung into one longwave, or by a still more rapid rotation, can be 
divided into three, four, or more. The links of the chain flash in the light, 
and produce the most pleasing effects. 

" It must be remembered that if cords, chains, water, air, &c, can 
assume a wave-like motion, the wonderful tension and elasticity of the hypo- 
thetical ether would permit the latter to adapt itself to the most compli- 
cated movements almost with the rapidity of thought. The very spiral, 
spindle-like, or corkscrew motion observable in the chain and cord affords 
a good idea of the mechanism of the propagation of light, as the movement 
of each molecule of ether is always perpendicular to the path of the ray or 
wave of light. 

" The astonishing rapidity of the periodic movements of the non-gravi- 
tating molecules of ether becomes apparent, when it is stated that to 
produce white light five hundred millions of millions of vibrations of the 
ether, 1,000.000,000,000 x 500 must occur in every second of time. 

" Or, taking the coloured rays at the extremities of the solar spectrum, 
viz., the red ray and the violet, the former demands the recurrence of four

hundred and fifty-eight millions of millions, 1,000,000,000.000 X 458 ; and 
the latter, the violet, a still larger number, and greater rapidity of vibration, 
six hundred and ninety-nine millions of millions, 1,000.000,000,000 x 699 
per second. 

" The coloured rays of light are supposed, according to the undulatory 
theory, to be distinguished from each other by the breadths of the different 
waves, just as the sound of a stringed instrument may vary according to 
the diameter and thickness of the strings. A tightly-stretched thin cord 
vibrating would be the parallel to violet light. It is an axiom that, " The 
rapidity of vibration is inversely proportional to the length and diameter 
of the string, and proportional to the square root of the tension. A thicker 
cord not so tightly stretched, would be the parallel to red light. 

Heat a Source of Light. 

"When iron is heated to a temperature of 635 Fahrenheit, it emits a 
dull red light, visible only in a darkened room. If the heat is further in- 
creased to 903 Fahrenheit, a bright red light is apparent, visible in a 
chamber fairly illuminated. The light attains a greater intensity at the 
moment the iron is heated to 1000 Fahrenheit. Thus, by the progressive 
increase of the heat of the iron, what is call a dull red, a pale red, and a 
white heat is obtained. By increasing the heat of a solid body a develop- 
ment of light or incandescence is obtainable. 

Light the frequent attendant of Electrical Phenomena. 

" The intense and dazzling brightness of lightning has been known to 
■cause temporary and permanent blindness. The immense electric spark, 
the result of the discharge of thousands of acres of charged clouds, will 
probably be more closely imitated than ever by an enormous induction 
coil, now being constructed by Mr. Apps for the Royal Polytechnic, which 
.is calculated to give a spark 5 ft. in length, the usual length being from 
5 to 18 in., or, in very rare cases, 2 ft. At the moment of discharge the 

• electricity may develop light, heat, magnetical, mechanical, and chemical 

• effects. Here is a correlation of forces that might well excuse Oersted in 
proposing a theory of light in which he regards light as the result of electric 

: sparks." 

Light moves with extraordinary swiftness. It travels at the rate of 

182,000 miles in a second, and will go eight times round the earth while 

.-a person could count " one." It acts on the nerve of the eye and causes 

1 us to see. The pupil contracts when the light falls on it full and brilliantly, 

; as from the sun, etc., and dilates when the rays of light are few. The 

sudden light is therefore painful because it falls on a dilated pupil, which 

has not had time to contract. By dilating and contracting to catch 

more or keep back the rays, the pupil of the eye accommodates itself to 

. light or darkness. 

The broad pupil of a cat's eye is fatigued by light, therefore she closes 
her eyes, blinks at fire-light, and sleeps much by day ; — seeing best in the 

• dark, because she has the power, as tigers and owls also have, of dilating 
,the pup' 1 ^f the eye to collect scattered rays in a manner impossible to us,

THE HUMAN EYE. 

From Professor Pepper's " Cyclopedic Science Simplified? 

" This elaborate and wonderful work of the Creator, built up of the usual 
constituents of animal substances, viz. — albumen, gelatine, fibrine, with a 
little fatty matter— all marvellously shaped and fitted to their purposes > 
represents an optical instrument which transcends every contrivance made 
by the hand of man. The camera obscura is the nearest approach to an 
imitation of the eye. It is fitted with a double-convex lens ; the rays of 
light thrown off from any object placed before the apparatus are brought 
to a focus, and received upon a sheet of paper or piece of ground glass. 
In the eye the same result is brought about by the refraction of light in the 
crystalline lens and the other humours ; the rays are brought to a focus, 
and impinge upon a nerve, spread out as a delicate network to catch the 
beams, and to vibrate in sympathy with those exquisite undulations which 
cause the propagation of light, and thus to produce the sensation of vision. 
Anatomists have given this organ their most careful attention, and pub- 
lished elaborate drawing of the various parts of the eye. By the permission 
of Messrs. Chadburn, of Sheffield, a copy of their instructive diagrams of 
the eye is added. 

A. The Pupil, or circular opening in the iris, capable of being con- 
tracted or enlarged, according to the amount and intensity of light. 

B. The Iris, a flat circular membrane, of a grey, blue, or black colour, 
forming the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. It performs the 
same functions as a diaphragm in an optical instrument. 

C. The Sclerotic Coat, a tough white membrane, to which the muscles 
for moving the eyeball are attached. 

D. The Eyelids, containing the tarsal fibro-cartilages. 

E. The Cornea, composed of tough transparent laminae, forming the 
front of the eye ; the first surface, where the rays of light are refracted. 
Some anatomists have considered the sclerotica and cornea as one and 
the same, and have termed the cornea the transparent, and the sclerotica 
the opaque cornea. 

F. The Aqueous Humour, contained in a delicate membrane filling the 
space from the cornea to the crystalline lens. The space occupied by this 
humour is divided into two parts by the iris, forming, as shown at B, the 
anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. 

G. The Crystalline Lens, contained in a transparent membrane called 
the Capsule, the principal refracting medium of the eye. The capsule 
adheres by its edge to the ring-shaped body called the Ciliary Circle or 
ligament, N. 

H. The Vitreous Humour, contained in the hyaloid membrane — a 
jelly-like substance, resembing the white of an egg, filling the body of the 
eye. 

I. The Retina, a membrane which receives the impression of light, 
and transmits it to the brain through the optic nerve, K. 

J. The Choroid Coat, a delicate membrane lining the sclerotica, 
covered on its inner surface with a black substance (pigmenlum nigrum, 
resembling the colouring matter of the negro's skin) contiguous to the

" Brewster found the following to be the refractive powers of the dif- 
ferent humours of the eye, the ray of light being incident upon them from 
air : — 



Aqueous humour . . . . I '336

„ „ centre . 1-3990 



Crystalline lens, mean . . 1 '3839 
Vitreous humour .... 1*3394 
Water i'3358 



" But the rays of light are not all incident upon them from the air, and 
as the rays refracted by the aqueous humour pass into the crystalline, 
and those from the crystalline into the vitreous humour, the indices of re- 
fraction of the separating surfaces of their humours will be — 

From aqueous humour to outer coat of the crystalline . . 1*0455 

From „ „ to crystalline, using the mean index 1*0352 

From vitreous to crystalline, outer coat 1 '0443

" The eye, as already described, consists of four coats or membranes, 
which are disposed in the following order — viz., 1st, the sclerotic ; 2nd the 
cornea, which fits into it like the glass of a watch ; 3rd, the choroid ; and 
4th, the retina : of two fluids or humours, the aqueous and the vitreous, 
and of a lens called the crystalline. 

" Over the cornea and sclerotic is expanded a delicate mucous mem- 
brane, called the conjunctiva. The iris is suspended across the eye, and 
in its centre is an opening, termed the pupil, which immediately opens 
when the light diminishes, and closes if the light is too strong. The 
posterior convexity of the lens is greater than the anterior. Sometimes, 
from a too great convexity of the lens or the cornea, the rays of light 
which enter the eye come to a focus before they impinge upon the retina, 
producing the defect called short-sighted vision. Optical science corrects 
this inconvenience by the use of a concave lens. If the crystalline lens is 
not sufficiently convex, the rays of light come to a focus behind the retina ; 



7$ • The Human Eye. 



this defect is surmounted by the use of a convex lens, which diminishes 
the divergence of the rays. Such ingenious artificial additions to the eye 
are common enough at the present day, but it may be asked, how did our 
forefathers bear these infirmities ? Spectacles are supposed to have been 
unknown to the ancients, and it is stated by Francesco Redi that they 
were invented in the 13th century, between the years 1280 and 1311, pro- 
bably about the year 1299 or 1300 ; he gave the honour of the discovery 
to Alexander de Spina, a monk of the order of Predicants of St. Catharine, 
at Pisa. Muschenbroek, the old electrician who discovered the Leyden 
jar, observes that it is inscribed on the tomb of Salvinus Armatus, a noble- 
man of Florence, who died in 1317, that he was the inventor of spectacles. 
This may have been the person who had the secret as well as the learned 
monk, because Redi states that the latter only disclosed the secret upon 
learning that another person had it as well as himself. 

" Mr. Acland makes the following practical and valuable observations on 
defects of vision : — 

1 On the Symptoms indicating a Necessity for Spectacles. 

" ( The natural decay of vision occurs usually from thirty to fifty years 
of age, varying according to habits and employment of the individual. 
Some time during this interval the refractive power of the crystalline 
humours of the eye slightly alters its condition, whilst the crystalline lens 
and cornea change their form, so that a difficulty of distinct vision is felt. 
The eye loses a portion of its power of seeing at varying distances, or its 
power of adjustment ; and near objects are no longer as easily seen as in 
youth. Reading small print by candlelight is difficult, as the book re- 
quires to be held at a greater distance from the eye than formerly, and a 
more powerful light is needed ; and even then the letters appear misty, 
and to run one into the other, or seem double. And still further, in order 
to see more easily, the light is often placed between the book and the eye, 
and fatigue is soon felt, even with moderate reading. 

" ' When these symptoms show the eye to have altered its primitive 
form, spectacles are absolutely needed. Nature is calling for aid, and 
must have assistance, and if such is longer withheld, the eye is needlessly 
taxed, and the change, which at first was slight, proceeds more rapidly, 
until a permanent injury is produced. 

" ' There is a common notion that the use of spectacles should be put 
of? as long as possible, but such is a great mistake, leading often to 
impaired vision for life, and is even more injurious than a too early 
employment. 

" ' Timely assistance relieves the eye, and diminishes the tendency to 
flattening, whereas should the use of spectacles be longer postponed, the 
eye changes rapidly, and when the optician is at last consulted, it is found 
that a deeper focus spectacle must be used than usual for the first pair, 
and even these suit but a short time and have to be again exchanged for 
those of still deeper power ; and these frequent changes become a matter 
of necessity which, unless judiciously checked, continue during life. 

" ' It must not be forgotten that, when first using spectacles, they are 
not required during daylight, but only for reading, etc., by artificial light, 
and it may be from six months to two years from the time of first adopting 
them ere they will be required for day use. 



The Stereoscope. 



" ' Spectacles for the Short-sighted. — Short sight is often present at birth, 
but is little noticed, nor its inconveniences felt, until study becomes im- 
perative. When this occurs, the power employed should be always 
slightly under that needed to remedy the defect, otherwise the eye will 
gradually accommodate itself to the lenses, and require constantly an in- 
crease of power. In all cases leave some little for the adjustment of the 
eye to do, and then you may, after a time, diminish the power of the lenses 
needed. 

" ' The Optician's Knowledge. — Having now shown when spectacles 
should be employed, let us for a moment consider what are the require- 
ments that should in all cases be possessed by the optician to whom the 
selection of spectacle lenses is entrusted. 

" ' These requirements are — 

"'ist. An intimate knowledge of the anatomical structure of the eye, 
and of the theory of vision. 

" ' 2nd. An extensive acquaintance with the science of optics. 

" ' 3rd. A sound mathematical knowledge. 

" ' 4th. A practical acquaintance with the manufacture of lenses and 
spectacle frames. 

ut Having for the last fourteen years made the adaptation of spectacles 
my especial study, I have frequently met with cases where great injury 
has been done to the weak-sighted by the ordinary optician's im- 
proper selection of spectacles ; and I could heartily wish more of my 
medical brethren would bring their knowledge to bear on this subject, — 
which demands, and frequently calls forth, all the science and skill we 
possess, to meet the requirements of some abnormal cases that present 
themselves.' 

" The knowledge which the eye conveys to the mind is boundless ; the 
relative condition of matter, large and small, of motion or rest, of colour, 
of solidity, of transparency, of brilliancy, of opacity, of space or distance, 
are only a few of the results attained by the exercise of the faculty of 
vision." 



THE STEREOSCOPE. 

u This most valuable and instructive instrument, and now not only a 
1 household word,' but a piece of domestic apparatus without which no 
drawing-room is thought complete, was invented by Professor Wheatstone, 
and subsequently modified by Sir D. Brewster. It demonstrates that man 
must have two eyes in order to enjoy the appreciation of distance, or, like 
the fabled Polyphemus, we might only have had one eye. Mr. Woodward 
gives the following excellent and familiar explanation of the phenomena 
produced by the stereoscope. 

1 A Familiar Explanation of the Phenomena produced by the Stereoscope* 

" ' The name is derived from two Greek words, signifying to view solid 
things, and the instrument is so constructed that two flat pictures, taken 
under certain conditions, shall appear to form a single solid or projecting 
body. 

" ' A picture of any object is formed on the retina of each eye ; but 
although there may be but one object presented to the two eyes, the pic- 



So 



The Stereoscope. 



tures formed on the two retinas are not precisely alike, because the object 
is not observed from the same point of view. 

" ' If the right hand be held at right angles to, and a few inches from, 
the face, the back of the hand will be seen when viewed by the right eye 
only, and the palm of the hand when viewed by the left eye only ; hence 
the images formed on the retinae of the two eyes must differ, the one 
including more of the right side and the other more of the left side of the 
same solid or projecting object. Again, if we bend a card so as to represent 
a triangular roof, place it on the table with the gable end towards the 
eyes, and look at it, first with one eye and then with the other, quickly and 
alternately opening and closing one of the eyes, the card will appear to 
move from side to side, because it will be seen by each eye under a dif- 
ferent angle of vision. If we look at the card with the left eye only, the 
whole of the left side of the card will be plainly seen, while the right side 
will be thrown into shadow. If we next look at the same card with the 
right eye only, the whole of the right side of the card will be distinctly 
visible, while the left side will be thrown into the shadow ; and thus two 
images of the same object, with differences of outline, light and shade, will 




Professor Wheatstone's Reflecting Stereoscope. 

be formed— the one on the retina of the right eye, and the other on the 
retina of the left. These images falling on corresponding parts of the 
retina convey to the mind the impression of a single object;* while expe- 
rience having taught us, however unconscious the mind may be of the 
existence of two different images, that the effect observed is always pro- 
duced by a body which really stands out or projects, the judgment natu- 
rally determines the object to be a projecting body. 

" ' It is experience also that teaches us to judge of distances by the 
different angles of vision under which an object is observed by the two 
eyes ; for the inclination of the optic axes, when so adjusted that the 
images may fall on corresponding parts of the retince, and thus convey to 
the mind the impression of a single object, must be greater or less, accord- 
ing to the distance of the object from the eyes. 

" ' Perfect vision cannot then be obtained without two eyes, as it is by 
the combined effect of the image produced on the retina of each eye, and 



* " That this is the correct theoiy of single vision with the two eyes is evident. 
For if, while looking at a single object with both eyes, Ave make a slight pressure 
with the finger on one of the eyeballs, we shall immediately perceive \wo objects; 
but, on removing the pressure, only one will be again seen." 



The Stereoscope, 



the different angles under which objects are observed, that a judgment is 
formed respecting their solidity and distances. 

" ' A man restored to sight by couching cannot tell the form of a body 
without touching it, until his judgment has been matured by experience, 
although a perfect image may be formed on the retina of each eye. A man 
with only one eye cannot readily distinguish the form of a body which he 
had never previously seen, but quickly and unwittingly moves his head 
from side to side, so that his one eye may alternately occupy the different 
positions of a right and a left eye ; and, if we approach a candle with one 
eye shut, and then attempt to snuff it, w r e shall experience more difficulty 
than we might have expected, because the usual mode of determining the 
correct distance is wanting. 

"' In order, then, to deceive the judgment, so that flat surfaces may 
represent solid or projecting figures, we must cause the different images of 
a body, as observed by the two eyes, to be depicted on the respective 
retinae, and yet to appear to have emanated from one and the same object. 
Two pictures are therefore taken from the really projecting or solid body, 
the one as observed by the right eye only, and the other as seen by the left. 
These pictures are then placed in the box of the stereoscope, which is 
furnished with two eye-pieces, containing lenses so constructed that the 
rays proceeding from the respective pictures to the corresponding eye- 
pieces shall be refracted or bent outwards, at such an angle as each set of 
rays would have formed had they proceeded from a single picture in the 
centre of the box to the respective eyes, without the intervention of the 
lenses ; and as it is an axiom in optics that the mind always refers the 
situation of an object to the direction from which the rays appear to have 
proceeded when they enter the eyes, both pictures will appear to have 
emanated from one central object ; but as one picture represents the real 
or projecting object as seen by the right eye, and the other as observed by 
the left, though appearing by refraction to have proceeded from one and 
the same object, the effects conveyed to the mind, and the judgment 
formed thereon, will be precisely the same as if the images were both 
derived from one solid or projecting body, instead of from two pictures, 
because all the usual conditions are fulfilled ; and consequently the two 
pictures will appear to be converted into one solid body. 

" ' The necessary pictures for producing these effects, excepting those of 

geometrical figures, which may 
be laid down by certain rules, 
cannot, however, be drawn by 
the hands of man ; for, as Pro- 
fessor Wheatstone has observed, 
'It is evidently impossible for 
the most accurate and accom- 
plished artist to delineate, by the 
sole aid of his eye, the two pro- 
jections necessary to form the 
stereoscopic relief of objects as 
they exist in nature, with their 
delicate differences of outline, 
light, and shade. But what the hand of the artist was unable to accomplish, 
the chemical action of light,directcd by the camera, has enablod us to effect.

§- Refraction of Light. 



" ' Daguerreotype portraits and Talbotype pictures are therefore taken 
usually by two cameras placed towards the object, with a difference of 
angle equal to the difference of the angle of vision of the two eyes, which 
is about 1 8° when the object is eight inches from the eyes ; hence, if these 
be carefully examined and compared with the original projecting objects, 
they will be found to be faithful representations of the object as seen by 
each eye respectively." 

Directions for using the Stereoscope. 

" * The objects must be so adjusted in the box, that only one picture may 
be seen in the centre, care being taken that the pictures are not reversed 
so as to be seen by the right eye instead of the left, and vice versa. 

" ' The proper position of portraits, buildings, and similar objects cannot 
be mistaken ; but where this is not readily perceived, it should be ascer- 
tained, when the object can be marked so as at once to be properly 
placed. 

" ' The eye-pieces, if allowed to turn, are marked with arrows, to indi- 
cate their proper position, these must be placed inwards, and in a right 
line with each other. 

" ' The eye-pieces in some instances are made to draw out to suit the 
foci of different persons. But those who use spectacles will generally see 
best with them on, bringing them forward so as to lie flat on the eye-pieces, 
which in such cases should not be drawn out. 

" ' Persons, however, with a defective sight in either eye will not be able 
to perceive the astonishing effects of the arrangement, as two different 
images will not be perfectly formed on the retina? of the respective eyes.' " 

REFRACTION OP LIGHT. 

Some slight knowledge of the refraction of light may be of great im- 
portance to boys or lady-bathers. We shall subjoin a few remarks from 
" Cyclopaedic Science," and a practical hint on the subject : — 

"When a ray of light passes from one medium to another of the same 
density, and in a perfectly straight line, no alteration of its course takes 
place ; but if the light passes in an oblique direction, its course is broken 
or refracted— i.e., bent back from its natural path. To this branch of 
optics, which includes, perhaps, the widest field of inquiry, and traces the 
propagation of light through transparent, solid, liquid, and gaseous bodies, 
has been given the name of 

Dioptrics. 

" To prove that a straight line representing a ray of light is really bent 
when passing from a rare medium, air, into a denser one, such as water, 
nothing is easier than to place a bright shilling on the end of an ivory 
paper-knife, which is inclined in a large empty tumbler. On looking down 
the paper-knife a straight line only is apparent, terminating with the coin ; 
but if the tumbler is filled with water whilst the observer is still looking 
down the flat surface, he will notice that at the point of juncture between 
the air and water a break takes place, and the end of the paper-knife, or 
all that part immersed, appears to be lifted up or bent upwards from its

natural course or direction. If a small pocket-pistol were now aimed at 
the coin and the bullet discharged it would certainly miss, because even- 
visible object appears to be in a

of Refraction. 



direction represented by a straight 
line drawn from it to the eye. A 
straight line ruled to the shilling 
would not touch it, the line must 
be ruled to, or the pistol aimed at, 
a point nearer to the spectator 
than the apparent position of the 
coin." 

This refraction of light causes 
a river or stream to appear much 
more shallow than it really is, be- 
cause the light of the bottom of 
the river is refracted as it comes 
out of the water, and the bottom 
consequently appears much nearer 
to the surface than it really is. The 
old " Sandford and Merton" ex- 



periment of placing a shilling in a bowl and moving away till you lose 
sight of it, and then getting some one to pour water in on it, which brings 
it to your view again immediately, by ref?'action, will exhibit this delusion, 
which it is well for boys and young-lady swimmers to know. A river is 
always one-third deeper than it seems to be. 



REFLECTION OP LIGHT. 

The rays of light are reflected from substances which are light and 
brilliant, as glass, crystals, steel, etc. Other substances absorb light, and 
always appear dark and dull. 

We see ourselves in a mirror by the reflected rays of light from our 
own face, which, striking the surface, are reflected back to our eyes. The 
reason of this is, that the rays cannot pass through the metal with which 
the back of the glass is covered, and therefore, are tftrown back in reflec- 
tion. Looking-glass is an excellent reflector of light, water is a good 
one, and polished metal also ; therefore before glass was known, the 
maiden gazed at her face in a limpid stream, or decked her tresses by the 
reflection of a polished steel mirror. 

Light is of the utmost importance to health. Mothers should beware 
of a dark nursery ; neither animals nor plants will flourish in dark places. 
It is to light that we owe the beautiful colours which deck the universe. 

Every ray of light contains the colours of the rambow. Some things 
reflect one of these colours and some another, according as their surface is 
constructed, physically and chemically. The swiftness or slowness with 
which the undulations of ether are thrown back from surfaces causes 
colour. Quick undulations produce bine, violet, and their different shades. 
in order to produce the violet colour, the undulations of ether must be 
699 millions of millions in a second of time. Slow undulations produce 
red ; the ether being thrown off the surface of the body at the rate of 
477 millions of millions of vibrations in a second. 



o4 



Artificial Light, 



Yellow is the medium of undulations between blue and red. Red., 
blue, and yellow are the three primary colours, the others are compounds 
of them and affected by the same laws. 

Black objects are without colour, because their surfaces will not reflect 
at all the undulations of ether which touch them, and which consequently 
cease. White objects set in motion all the undulations of ether, so as to 
reflect all the rays together, the effect of which is to produce white light. 

There are of course many colouring matters in existence, that is, matters 
which affect these undulations of ether. Chlorophyll, for example, which 
gives the green colour to leaves and is 
formed by the agency of the sun's rays ; 
vegetation grown out of sunlight is yel- 
low and faded-looking. 



ARTIFICIAL LIGHT. 

Artificial light has next to be con- 
sidered ; and here the science of che- 
mistry has been of the greatest service 
to man. In all ages, when science was 
little known, men provided themselves 
with artificial light. Probably the first 
lights used were torches of dry and 
resinous woods, but veiy early the use of 
oil for the purpose was discovered. It 
was olive-oil which fed the golden can- 
dlesticks in the Tabernacle, and in tombs 
of the greatest antiquity oil lamps have 
been frequently found. 

Many other vegetable oils besides 
that of the olive-tree exist, and have 
been used for light. Nuts and almonds 
yield a pure sweet smelling oil : so do 
seeds of flax, hemp, and rape. 

The cocoa-nut and the fruit of the 
African palm give us oil ; animals and 
minerals also supply it ; the sperm 
whale affords sperm oil ; it may also be 
obtained from the pilchard. Mineral 
oils are of peculiar lustre and brilliancy ; 
naphtha, pitch, asphalte, all burn. Petro- 
leum springs have yielded a new supply 
of light. 

A wax myrtle grows in Louisiana, 
from which berries enough may be 
gathered in a day to make eight pounds 
of tallow, which is much harder and 
purer than common tallow. 

The candleberry myrtle of the 
United States has its fruit or nuts covered with a waxy secretion, which

may be readily separated and manufactured into candles. This wax has 
long been an article of commerce. 

The Wax-palm and the Wax-tree of Japan, again, assist us in pro- 
curing artificial light ; the candles made with it are coated with bees - 
wax. Bornean vegetable tallow, chemically treated, yields a valuable pro- 
duct for the same purpose. 

Candles were at first made by dipping ropes, rushes, or the papyrus 
fibre into grease or wax. They are of great antiquity. Egyptian candles 
have been discovered, and Roman ones have been found in Shropshire. 

The time-measuring candles of Alfred the Great are well known. Rush- 
lights are of the greatest antiquity of all candles. In the last century the 
poor in England and Ireland used no other candles, and they were of 
home manufacture. 

Gilbert White, in his " Natural Histoiy of Selborne," gives the follow- 
ing account of this manufacture of our forefathers : — 

" The proper species is the common soft rush, found in most pastures 
by the sides of streams and under hedges. Decayed labourers, women, 
and children gather these rushes late in summer. As soon as they are 
cut, they must be flung into water, and kept there, otherwise they will dry 
and shrink, and the peel will not run. When peeled, they must lie on the 
grass to be bleached, and take the dew for some nights, after which they 
are dried in the sun. Some address is required in dipping these rushes 
into the scalding fat or grease. The careful wife of an industrious Hamp- 
shire labourer obtains all her fat for nothing, for she saves the scummings 
of her bacon-pot for this use ; and if the grease abound with salt she 
causes the salt to precipitate to the bottom by setting the scummings in a 
warm oven. A pound of common grease may be procured for fourpence, 
and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes, which cost one 
shilling, so that seven pounds of rushlights will cost three shillings. If 
persons who keep bees will mix a little wax with the grease it will give a 
consistency, render it more cleanly, and make the rushes burn longer ; 
mutton suet will have the same effect. A pound avoirdupois contains 
iooo rushes ; and, supposing each to burn on an average but half-an-hour, 
then a poor man will purchase 500 hours of light — nearly twenty-one 
entire days — for three shillings. According to this account, each rush 
before dipping, costs one thirty-third of a farthing, and one-eleventh after- 
wards. Thus, a poor family will enjoy five-and-a-half hours of comfortable 
light for a farthing." 

A pound and a half of rushes supplied a poor family of that period with 
light for a year. 

Tallow-dips came next, probably, in the course of candle progress. 
In them, cotton is substituted for rushes as the wick, the mode of making 
them being much the same. Lengths of cotton are cut off, hung up by a 
loop, dipped into melted tallow, taken out again, and cooled ; then 
re-dipped until enough tallow has been accumulated round the wick- 
cotton. Dips were followed by moulds. A frame with a number of moulds 
the size of the intended candles is made. A wick is passed down each 
mould to the bottom where it is pegged in — the little peg holding the 
cotton tight and stopping the aperture so that no fluid shall run through. 
The tallow is then melted and the moulds are filled. After a while, the 
moulds cool, the excess of tallow is poured off at one corner, and then

cleaned off altogether and the ends of the wick cut away. The candles 
can then be easily lifted from the mould, as they are narrower at the top 
than the bottom. 

The Russian tallow, suet or fat of the ox, of which dips and old- 
fashioned mould candles were made, was converted, by Gay-Lussac, into 
the substance known to us by the name of stearine, in the following 
manner. — Fat, or tallow, consists of a chemical combination of fatty acids, 
with glycerine. It is first boiled with quick-lime, which unites with the pal- 
mitic, olive, and stearic acids, and separates the glycerine. Thus a soap is 
made. This is decomposed by sulphuric acid, which takes away the lime ; 
the melted fatty acids rise to the surface, where they are decanted. They 
are again washed and cast into thin plates which, when cold, are placed 
between layers of cocoa-nut matting, and submitted to intense hydraulic 
pressure. In this way the olive acid, which is soft, is pressed out, and the 
hard palmitic and stearic acids remain. These are again purified by 
pressure at a higher temperature, and by washing in warm diluted sul- 
phuric acid, when they are ready to be made into candles, and are 
harder, whiter, cleaner/ and more combustible than the fats from which 
they are obtained. 

Wax candles cannot be cast as tallow are. To make them, a number of 
cottons are hung on frames, and covered with metal tags at the ends to keep 
the wax from covering the cotton. Melted wax is then poured, by a man, 
over them ; the frame being brought close to the wax-heater. When the first 
wax is cold a second coat is given, and so on till the candles are as thick 
as they are required to be. When finished, they are taken down and well 
rolled upon a fine stone slab ; the conical top is moulded by properly- 
shaped tubes, and the bottoms cut off and trimmed. The wicks of tallow 
candles require snuffing because they are never quite consumed in the 
flame, the outer cone preventing a sufficient supply of oxygen reaching it 
for complete combustion. Wax and composite candles do not require 
snuffing, because the wick is so plaited as to bend into the outer cone of 
the flame where it is completely consumed. This cannot be done with 
tallow candles, because this bending of the wick into the outer cone would 
melt the tallow on one side too quickly, and cause the candle to gutter; 
tallow melting at a much lower temperature than wax or stearine. 

The continuous flame of the candle is caused by the heated wick de- 
composing the wax or tallow, and forming vapour of water and carbonic 
acid gas. The hydrogen of the candle combining with the oxygen of the 
air forms the former ; the carbon of the candle combining with the oxygen 
forms the carbonic acid gas. 

As the air comes to the candle, it moves upwards by the force of the 
current which the heat of the candle produces, and cools all the sides of 
the wax or tallow, so that it keeps the edges much cooler than the part 
within ; the part within is heated by the flame which runs down the wick 
as far as it can go before it is extinguished, and forms a little cup of liquid 
tallow or wax, while the edges never melt. Of course, if by leaning the 
candle on one side, a current of air is made in a slanting direction, the 
cup will become lopsided and the fluid will run over, or gutter, as it is 
called. 

The horizontal formation of this cup is of the first importance, for if it 
be not horizontal the fluid will run away in guttering. 



Artificial Light. 87 

Fluted candles are not good for burning on this account ; they have 
not the nicely formed edge to the cup, which is the perfection of a candle, 
and consequently prove wasteful from guttering.* 

The fuel for the flame is this melted part of the candle which is carried 
up the wick by capillary attraction — which we have already explained 
in a note at p. 59. Capillary attraction is sometimes unpleasantly but well 
exemplified by some careless person leaving the corner of a towel in 
water — the water, by the power of capillary attraction, spreads all over the 
towel and wets it through. In the like manner, water rises through a 
sponge, or a lump of sugar. Thus the melted tallow ascends the wick ; 
other particles follow from their mutual attraction to each other, and arc 
gradually consumed. Whenever the flame descends into the melted tallow 
it is instantly extinguished, therefore the flame remains in the place 
where we always see it. 

The flame of a candle consists of three cones ; the inner or hollow 
cone, in which no combustion takes place, and which is filled with invisible 
vapour raised from the candle by the heat of the wick, and which cannot 
burn because it does not come in contact with the outer air ; an interme- 
diate cone, where hydrogen is chiefly consumed with particles of carbon 
which it raises to a white heat (from thence the light chiefly proceeds) ; and 
the outer cone in which the carbon is consumed. The flame of a candle 
produces light because the chemical changes made by combustion excite 
undulations of luminous ether which, striking the eye, produce light. The 
light of the flame is yellow, because that is the colour of carburetted hy- 
drogen when burning ; and here we may observe that yellow rays pro- 
duce the greatest amount of light, as red rays produce the greatest amount 
of heat. 

The flame of a candle is of an oblong shape, brighter at the top than 
towards the bottom ; it is carried upwards by the ascending air, which, 
heated by the candle, goes rapidly upwards. ' The darker parts, towards 
the bottom of the flame, are particles of the fuel not in a perfect state of 
ignition. 

Certain products result from the combustion of a candle. One of 
these products is charcoal, or soot. Some of our readers may have seen 
etchings done on a card rapidly passed through, or over a lighted candle, 
till it is shaded black, or dark brown, with soot. But, if the candle burns 
well, that is, if the combustion is perfect, no smoke or soot will proceed 
from it ; soot being, as we have said, the escape of unconsumed fuel. 

Water also is produced from the flame of a candle — i.e., vapour of 
water which, if cooled, will condense as water. Water is likewise pro- 
duced from the combustion of gas and from that of oil — a pint of oil fairly 
and properly burned produces rather more than a pint of water. In fact, 
all combustible substances which burn with a flame produce vapour of 
water, which may be condensed if anything cold enough is held over it. 

The combustion of a candle also produces, as we have said, carbonic 



* The action of the ascending current of air on the outside of a candle may be 
seen when it has guttered. The thickened piece at the side forms a little pillar, 
as the candle goes on burning, because as it rises higher above the rest of the 
tallow or wax, the air gets better round it and it is more cooled.

acid gas, very often called fixed air,* and evolves heat from it precisely as 
we by breathing make heated carbonic acid gas, and thus feed the animal 
heat. The candle cannot burn without oxygen ; neither can we live with- 
out oxygen, as we have before observed. 

A lamp burns on the same principle as a candle, and is probably long 
prior to it in antiquity. 

The oil is the fuel which, by capillary attraction, ascends the wick and 
is consumed by the carbon combining with the oxygen of the air. The 
Argand lamp is remarkable for its excellent combustion. A current of air 
is made to pass through the middle of the flame, in consequence of" which 
the carbon of the interior of the flame is consumed as well as that in the 
outer coating. These lamps do not smoke, because the combustion is 
perfect. Lamp-glasses diminish the smoke from lamps by producing a 
draught, which supplies more oxygen to the flame ; they also concentrate 
and reflect the heat of the flame, thus helping its combustion. 

Lamps smoke, either because the wick is turned up too high and more 
carbon is separated from it than can be consumed by the flame, or from 
the wick having been cut unevenly. When this is the case, the points of 
the jagged edge project into the flame where there is not enough oxygen 
to consume the carbon and, of course, cause smoke. 

Candles and lamps will often spirt when rain is at hand. This is 
caused by the air being filled with vapour which penetrates the wick, 
where, being formed into steam, it expands suddenly, and produces a little 
explosion. 

We cannot conclude these few remarks about the combustion of carbon 
without adding to them a passage from Professor Faraday's admirable 
lectures on the "Chemical History of a Candle," which we recommend to 
the perusal of our readers. He is speaking of the creation of carbonic acid 
gas :— 

" You will be astonished when I tell you what this curious play of 
carbon amounts to. A candle will burn some four, five, six, or seven hours. 
What then must be the daily amount of carbon going up into the air in 
the way of carbonic acid ? What a quantity of carbon must go from each 
of us in respiration ? A man, in twenty-four hours, converts as much as 
seven ounces of carbon into carbonic acid ; a milch cow will convert 
seventy ounces, and a horse seventy-nine ounces, solely by the act of 
respiration ; that is, the horse in twenty-four hours burns seventy-nine 
ounces of charcoal, or carbon, in his organs of respiration to supply his 
natural warmth in that time. All the warm-blooded animals get their 
warmth in this way, by the conversion of carbon, not in a free state, but 
in a state of combination. And what an extraordinary notion this gives us 
of the alterations going on in our atmosphere. As much as 5,000,000 
pounds, or 548 tons of carbonic acid is formed by respiration in London 
alone in twenty-four hours. And where does all this go ? Up into the air. 
If the carbon had been like the lead which I showed you, or the iron 
which, in burning, produces a solid substance, what would happen ? Com- 
bustion could not go on. As charcoal arises it becomes a vapour and

passes off into the atmosphere which is the great vehicle, the great carrier 
for conveying it away to other places. Then what becomes of it ? Won- 
derful it is to find that the change produced by respiration, which seems so 
injurious to us (for we cannot breathe air twice over), is the very life and 
support of plants and vegetables that grow upon the surface of the earth. 
It is the same also under the surface in the great bodies of water ; for fishes 
respire upon the same principle, though not exactly by contact with the 
open air."* 

WATER. 

Water is another of the great agents of life. Without it the whole 
world must perish. On its uses we have no occasion to dilate. It is one 
individual thing. It never changes. It can be added to by careful adjust- 
ments for a little while ; it can be taken apart and analysed, but it always 
remains water > either in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state. It can be cooled 
into solid ice, or heated into vapour, but it may always be restored to its 
original state by thawing or condensation. In both cases of transformation 
it gains a wonderful increase of volume. As ice, it swells so violently that 
it will burst iron ; and as steam, it expands and evaporates in a manner 
which reminds one of the genius the fisherman released from a bottle in the 
"Arabian Nights ;" or if restrained, it becomes the mighty and dangerous 
power which science has chained and fettered to man's chariot wheels. 
A knowledge of the expansion of water by cold may save many do- 
mestic inundations in the time of severe frost. The 
-water pipes should be kept (if possible) warm enough 
to prevent the water freezing ; the taps should be half 
turned, to let it drip a little. The jugs and bottles, in 
bedrooms which have no fires, should only be half 
filled with water. 

Water becomes ice at a temperature of 32 degrees. 
It is a remarkable exception to the general rule that 
cold contracts the volume of liquids. "Water which 
becomes solid in all parts of the globe at the level of 
the sea at 32 Fahrenheit, or of o° Centigrade," says 
Professor Pepper," expands instead of contracting when 
the water reaches a temperature of 40 Fahrenheit, and 
falls to 32 : the amount of expansion is not very great, 
being one part in ten thousand at 32 ." 

But the fact, which at first was thought illusory, is 
indisputable, as proved by the experiments of Dr. Hope. 
He placed two thermometers in a large vessel of water, 
the one being at the top, and the other at the bottom. 
Up to a temperature of 40 , the cold water contracted, 
and, being the heavier, sank to the bottom, and the lower 
thermometer registered the greatest cold. After 40 
was passed, the water evidently expanded ; the coldest 
to be at the top, and duly recorded by the thermo-

to the law of expansion, to have been uppermost, remains at the bottom, 
and therefore was heavier, bulk for bulk, than the water about to crystal- 
lize. It is this remarkable exception that preserves the fish in the lakes 
and rivers. During the severe winters of Siberia the water is frozen many 
feet thick ; but it is related by one of the exiles in this roomy but severe 
prison, that part of their amusement in certain seasons consisted in fishing 
in great holes in the ice, and all they caught they partially but immediately 
ate raw and living, biting out a piece of the back, which was declared to 
be a most agreeable tit-bit. 

" It is evident that the fish, if frozen, could have no power cf locomotion 
— they must die ; so that on the arrival of winter the Siberian waters 
would throw up their dead fish, as all would be killed if the water, which 
is a very bad conductor of heat, did not remain at 40 at the bottom of the 
lakes, rivers, and seas. 

" Bismuth is said to possess the same curious property of expanding 
whilst it is being cooled, and thus iron bottles filled with melted bismuth, 
and plugged with a screw, burst at the moment the metal assumes a solid 
state." 

This expansion of ice is supposed to be caused by the ice-crystals not 
fitting as closely to each other as the particles of water do. 

Ice is considerably lighter than water ; it floats on the surface of 
streams and ponds while the water flows beneath it, and is not chilled by 
the ice into freezing, when the surface is once covered ; for as we have 
said before, water is a bad conductor of heat or cold, and the ice acts as 
a shield to prevent the cold air freezing the river by convection. We see 
divine wisdom in this law, for if the ice were a good conductor of cold, or 
if it were heavier than water and were to sink to the bottom, rivers would 
become blocks of solid ice which no heat could thaw, and all creatures 
inhabiting them would perish. As it is, the ice preserves the water fluid 
for us in the severest weather. Of course the ice thickens in protracted 
cold, because the heat of the water immediately beneath escapes through 
its pores into the cold air ; but our English frosts never last long enough 
to allow this slow conduction to convert the whole of a large body of water 
into ice. 

Water is composed of two gases, oxygen and hydrogen — eight parts 
oxygen to one part hydrogen. It is fluid because its particles are kept 
separate by latent heat. When a certain quantity of this heat has been 
driven out the water becomes solid — that is, ice. We speak of water as 
salt or brackish water, hard water, and soft water. Salt water is that of 
the sea, which holds in solution a quantity of saline matters. Hard water 
is that obtained from springs in the ground, from rivers, pumps, and wells. 
Soft water is that of rain. 

"Water is presented to us in nature having different degrees of purity ; 
hence we speak of hard or soft water. The former may contain calcium 
carbonate and sulphate, magnesium carbonate and sulphate, sodium 
sulphate and chloride, and many other substances, in considerable quan- 
tities, especially if the water flowing into the well be derived chiefly from 
surface drainage. When rain-water has been collected after several hours' 
tain, it is almost in a state of purity, containing then only certain gaseous 
matters in solution : such water is usually called soft, because it is free from 
the salts a-!readv mentioned. If the rain-water be collected after a lon^

drought, it may then contain nitrates and salts of ammonium, and, if near 
the sea-side, would always contain sodium chloride or common salt." 

River-water contains a less proportion of saline matters in solution : 
it is not, however, so good to drink as spring-water, because it frequently 
occurs that rivers receive the sewage of large towns, and hence the water 
contains organic matter in solution, and, should the water be taken whilst 
this organic matter is undergoing decomposition, very serious conse- 
quences may result to the person drinking it. It is now, however, a rule in 
sanitary matters to endeavour to divert the sewage from our noble rivers 
when possible, and with the help of proper filters the Thames water is 
now potable and wholesome. 

All rivers flow into the sea, hence sea-water contains a larger quantity 
of sodium chloride, and many other salts, in solution, likewise organic 
matter ; but, curious to say, it remains in a uniform condition so far as the 
quantity of saline matter is concerned, and the specific gravity varies little, 
the mean being 1*027, pure water being rooo. 




A Still placed on a common fire or fitted to a proper furnace. 
Both the Stills have worm tubs or condensers. 



When sea-water or any other hard water is placed in a still and boiled, 
the earthy or saline matters are left behind, and, the steam only being con- 
densed, pure water is obtained. 

Some water is impregnated with lime, some with salt, some with iron. 
Mineral springs are caused by the water in its passage through the ground 
dissolving and absorbing metallic substances. 

It is difficult to wash linen in hard water because the soda of the soap 
combines with the sulphuric acid of the salts of hard water, and the oil of 
the soap with the lime, and then it floats in white flakes on the water. 

Wood ashes will, however, render hard water soft. The carbonate of 
potassa in the ashes, and the sulphate of lime in the water unite, and form 
into sulphate of potassa and carbonate of lime ; the ashes also render 
some of the soluble salts of water insoluble ; they fall to the bottom of the 
pan or tub as a sediment, and thus the water becomes fit to use for wash- 
ing. It will then cleanse linen by dissolving the stains on it, while the soap 
has the power of uniting with grease, and rendering it soluble in water. 

Water that has run through chalk is the worst of all for washing pur-

poses. It is also bad for cooking vegetables and for making tea ; a pinch 
of soda will soften it, by decomposing the earthy salts present in it. 

Water flowing from granite rock is the purest : slate formations also 
are favourable to the purity of water flowing from them. 

Rain-water is soft because it has not been impregnated with earths and 
minerals ; it is consequently very pleasant to use for washing. It dissolves 
the soap, instead of decomposing it as hard water does. 

Rain-water is produced chiefly by evaporation from the seas, but it is 
not salt, because saline matters will not evaporate. They remain in the 
bed of the ocean, the fresh vapour alone ascending from it into the cold re- 
gions of the sky ; from whence when condensed by cold air it falls in rain. 

Rain-water is more fertilizing for the soil than pump water. It contains 
more carbonic acid, and a small quantity of ammonia, which nourishes the 
young plants. 

Rain is in fact a great benefit to us, not only for " watering the earth," 
but because it dissolves as it falls all noxious exhalations that may be lin- 
gering in the air, it mixes the upper air with the air of the lower regions, 
and washes out sewers and ditches, the stagnant water in which might 
bring diseases. 

Rain is caused by a cold current of wind condensing the vapour of 
the clouds or the air, and precipitating it to the earth in drops. The va- 
poury particles in their descent attract each other, and those which are 
quite near unite and form drops. But in order that rain may fall, the 
atmosphere must be saturated with vapour ; unless this be the case the 
vapour will be held in solution in spite of the cold currents. 

A passing cloud coming in contact with cold air is condensed and falls 
in rain. More rain falls by night than by day, because the cold of the 
night condenses the air, and decreases its power of holding vapour in 
solution. 

Snow is the vapour of the air condensed by a cold current below freez- 
ing point, and precipitated as a shower of crystals. It is of great service, 
for it nourishes the earth and keeps it warm. It is a very bad conductor, 
having a great deal of air in its crystals ; it therefore prevents the heat of 
the earth passing off into the colder air, while it nourishes the soil with the 
carbonic acid it contains, which passes into every pore of the ground as 
the snow melts. Hail is frozen rain ; that is, rain which passing through a 
cold current or layer of air is turned into ice. Two strata of clouds of 
opposite electricities, and two currents of air, are the causes of hail ; the 
lower cloud containing resinous electricity is the one precipitated as hail. 

The density of the air is lowered previous to a storm ; this is shown by 
the rapid fall of the mercury in the barometer which is held up by the pres- 
sure of the atmosphere. This changed condition of the air causes some- 
times a painful oppression ; the air being lighter than usual does not 
balance the air in our bodies, and we have in consequence a disagreeable 
feeling of distension.* 

Then again air laden with vapour has less oxygen, and in fact has a ten-

the air before a storm, is the reason of corns aching. They cannot distend equally

dency to depress the nervous system. It is therefore not " mere fancy," 
as it is often called, which makes sensitive people susceptible of changes in 
the weather. All animals appear listless and drowsy when rain is at hand, 
because the air is supplying less oxygen. Sheep will lie under a hedge ; 
horses neigh ; cattle low from the same cause. Smoke falls, because the 
air is not dense enough to keep it up. 

Moist air is very objectionable to the housewife for another cause — it 
rusts her bright stoves and fire-irons. The oxygen in the air combines 
with the surface of the metal and oxidises — that is, rusts— the iron. The 
only way to prevent iron from rusting in moist air is to grease it — grease 
preventing the humidity of the air coming in contact with the surface of the 
iron. 

The oxygen of dry air will not rust iron ; moisture (or a very great 
degree of heat) is necessary to bring into action the affinity of oxygen for 
steel. Copper and zinc also are tarnished by oxidation. The oxygen 
from moist air combines with the surface of these metals, and tarnishes 
them ; they do not rust as steel does. Lead is rendered dull by moist air 
in the same way, and silver oxidizes and tarnishes. Platinum is the only 
metal which never oxidizes in moist air. Gold also is little affected by the 
atmosphere if it — the gold — be quite pure. 

We must now speak of water as a portion of our food, and a very im- 
portant portion it is. 

It is contained more or less in everything we eat ; when the food is of 
a dry nature, as wheat, peas, oatmeal, maize, etc., more drink is required. 

Spring-water is more agreeable to drink than soft water, because it con- 
tains carbonic acid which gives it the life and sparkle we all prefer, and 
singularly enough the acid so deadly to inhale is conducive to health when 
drunk in water, acting as a refrigerant and allaying irritability of stomach. 

The carbonic acid is produced in water by the presence of bicarbonate 
of lime in it. It escapes very quickly into the air, leaving the water flat 
and stale, therefore it is best drunk fresh from the pump, and should not 
be let stand long uncovered before using. 

The quality of the water of springs depends a great deal on the soil 
through which they pass ; from granite and slate formations it is very 
pure ; sandstone is inferior in this respect, while lime and magnesia ren- 
der the water, as we have seen, very hard, and if found in large quantities, 
make it injurious to health. Hard water is found most commonly to con- 
tain chalk — i.e., carbonate of lime. 

If the presence of this carbonate is suspected — and it will lurk in clear 
bright sparkling filtered water — it may be tested by boiling, when the 
chalk will at once be thrown as a " furr "* or coating on the inside of the 
vessel in which it has been boiled. 

If the lime in the water, however, is in the condition of the sulphate, — 
that is, gypsum, no amount of boiling will precipitate it. The only thing 
then to be done is to put carbonate of soda into the water in sufficient 



* This furr may be removed from kettles by boiling in them a little sal am- 
moniac. The hydrochloric acid unites with the lime of the furr, and the carbonic 
goes to the ammonia. Both of these new compounds dissolve, and can be very easily 
washed away. 



94 Water. 

quantity to convert the sulphate of lime into the carbonate. If the water 
be then boiled the chalk will be deposited as furr, and sulphate of soda 
will be left in the water. Hard water may be made softer by exposure to 
the air in a wide vessel — as a flat pan. The carbonic acid in it will 
escape into the air, and the mineral salts which cause its hardness will sub- 
side. It is lime and magnesia in various forms which cause "hardness" 
in water. 

Water contaminated by lead cisterns or pipes has proved very injurious. 
A ninth part of a grain of lead per gallon will affect the health of a whole 
family. But happily this injurious substance may be easily removed by 
filtering the water through sand. 

Water may be purified in many ways. Pouring it from a height into a 
flat pan, so as to allow the air to mix with it will improve it. Stirring ir 
about with freshly-made animal charcoal purifies it. You can purify a 
gallon of water with twenty drops of sulphuric acid. "An ounce of powdered 
alum dissolved and stirred into a hogshead of putrid water will precipitate 
the foul matter in a few hours, and render it pure again." 

Chips of oak wood put into water will purify it. The tannic acid in 
the oak effects this change. The worst impurity in water proceeds from 
sewage, which is apt to get into rivers and old wells. Nitrogenous pro- 
ducts when they become mixed with a large quantity of river water, absorb 
oxygen and are slowly converted into inorganic matter, the nitrogen they 
contain being converted into nitrous and nitric acids. These acids unite 
with lime, etc., and form nitrites and nitrates, while the carbon of which 
they were composed becomes carbonic acid. The hydrogen in them is 
formed into water. If these nitrites or nitrates of lime and magnesia are 
found in any water used for drinking purposes it should be avoided. 

Generally water had better be filtered, as it might look both bright and 
sparkling, and be even pleasant to the taste, and yet contain many impuri- 
ties. Filters are very cheap — a pretty glass one resembling an hour-glass 
in form, can be bought for ys. 6d. at the Crystal Palace ; or any poor man 
may make himself one in accordance with the directions given at the South 
Kensington Museum, which we transcribe for our readers. 

The Poor Man^s Filter made with a Flower-pot. — Plug the hole at the 
bottom, but not too tightly, with a new piece of sponge, lay over it powdered 
charcoal two inches thick ; cover this with a layer of two inches of clean 
sand ; put on that a layer of clean coar sish gravel three inches deep. 

Carbonic acid can be forced into water by pressure to a considerable 
extent ; and effervescing draughts are made upon this principle. The car- 
bonic acid contained in the drink is imprisoned by the cork and thus 
forced into the liquid by pressure, and absorbed in it. But when the cork 
is removed the carbonic acid flies off in bubbles or effervescence. Soda 
water contains eight times its bulk of carbonic acid gas which has been 
forced into it by pressure ; of course when it is uncorked the escape of the 
imprisoned carbonic acid is somewhat vehement. Ginger beer pops from 
the same cause when opened, because carbonic acid has been forced into 
it by tlie cork. All vinous fermentation produces carbonic acid. The 
presence of carbonic acid also gives a pleasant acid taste to soda water, 
ginger beer, champagne, and cider. 



Boiling Water.

Carbonic acid dissolves so readily in water, that water will take up in 
solution a volume of this gas equal to itself. 

It is expelled by boiling, therefore boiled water always tastes flat and 
insipid. 

Water in its ordinary state contains a considerable quantity of atmo- 
spheric air dissolved in it. It contains more oxygen than we find in the 
air itself; and this property of dissolving a large proportion of oxygen 
renders water fit to be the dwelling place of fish and other creatures which 
depend on it for the oxygen they breathe. 

Water contains much latent heat. This can be proved by pouring 
cold concentrated sulphuric acid into cold water, when 
chemical action evolves the latent heat of the water, 
and the mixture becomes extremely hot ; or cold 
water poured on lime unites with the lime, and be- 
coming solid gives off its latent heat — which is, in 
fact, required to keep it in a fluid state. In water 
as much as 1140 of heat may remain latent. Water, 
therefore, requires a large amount of heat to raise its 
temperature, the greater proportion of the heat applied 
to it entering into combination with it as latent heat ; 
and it is this property that renders water capable of 
cooling us to a great extent. No other liquid when 
drank cools in the same manner, though some few are 
better for cold applications. 

Water boils at a temperature of 212 F. under 
ordinaiy conditions — i.e., when the pressure of the 
air is fifteen pounds upo?i every square inch. 

But when the pressure is reduced by ascending 
mountains, where of course the column of air above is 
not so high, water will boil at 184 F. It is therefore 
possible to determine elevations, by the temperature 
of the boiling-point of water. (See the adjoining cut 
of the apparatus used for the purpose.) 

"The pressure of the air is represented by the 
height at which a column of mercury is supported : 
when the mercury is i6'6 inches high, water boils 
at 184 F. ; if the pressure is doubled, and the co- 
lumn of mercury stands at 32 '3 inches, water boils 
at 2 1 6° F. The difference between i6"6 inches and 
32*3 inches is very great, and it might be thought

that such a fall in the barometer could only be demonstrated by artificial 
means, and by the creation of a partial vacuum with an air-pump. But it 
must be remembered that there are certain spots on" the surface of the 
globe where the adventurous traveller may ascend nearly three miles above 
the level of the sea. 

" The famous De Saussure ascended to the summit of Mont Blanc, 
which is 15,650 feet above the level of the sea, and where water boils at a 
temperature of 185*8° F., and the barometer stands at about seventeen 
inches. The boiling-point of water is lowered about one degree for every 
590 ft. De Saussure's observations were verified by Tyndall in August, 
1859, when the temperature of boiling water at the summit of Mont 
Blanc was found to be 1 84-95° F« 

" It is by the careful observation of the temperature at which water boils 
that the height of any hill or mountain may be determined. Since Dr. 
Wollaston constructed his instrument for measuring heights by the obser- 
vation of the boiling-point, improvements have been made, as shown in 
figure annexed." 

Water simmers before it boils. This is caused by its being heated by 
convection. The water nearest to the fire becomes hot first, and being 
heated rises, while its place is supplied by the colder portion above. This 
is in its turn heated and rises up till the whole body of water boils ; 
the ascending current of hot water rises through the centre of the mass, 
the cold currents descend by the metal sides of the kettle. 

It is necessary, as heated water thus always ascends to the surface, 
that heat should be applied to the bottom, not the top of a kettle or boiler ; 
for if it were applied to the top of a kettle the water below the surface 
would never boil. If it is desired to cool a liquid, cold must be applied to 
the top of the vessel ; for cold portions always descend and will allow the 
under warm portions to ascend and be cooled in their turn. The ascend- 
ing and descending currents of boiling water produce the agitation called 
" simmering." The bubbles collapse beneath the surface, and the steam 
is condensed to water again. When it boils the heated bubbles rise to the 
surface, and steam is thrown off. The entangled air escaping from the 
water produces the sound called " singing," which ceases when all the 
water boils. 

Water expands, as we have said, with heat, consequently if a kettle be 
quite filled with cold water it must run over when the water is expanded 
by heat. Even when not quite filled this occasionally happens from rapid 
boiling. Steam escaping from the lid and spout are proofs that a kettle 
boils. Any good conductor placed in it, as an iron spoon, will delay the 
boiling of water, by carrying off a portion of the heat to itself. Water 
that boils is not rendered warmer by continued boiling after it has reached 
the boiling-point 21 2°, it only escapes in steam — or, as the housewife says, 
" boils away." Steam ascends as vapour into the higher regions of the 
air. It is really invisible, but condensed by the coldness of the air be- 
comes a mist. This can be seen by any one observing the spout of a 
kettle — an empty space will be observed between the spout and the little 
column of steam. Steam is really there also, but is invisible because the 
air has not yet chilled it. It is not possible to boil a pot of water by im- 
mersing it in boiling water, though gravy, etc., may be warmed thus ; — the 
heat is never sufficient, but brine, which boils at a higher temperature will

boil the water in another vessel immersed in it. Ether can be boiled in a 
vessel immersed in water, because it boils at a lower temperature, 96 . 

Water is best kept in uncovered cisterns, because the air prevents or 
annihilates putrefaction by supplying it with oxygen. It should never be 
allowed to stagnate ; the water in the cistern should be drawn off and 
replaced every twenty-four hours if possible. 

But do not leave a cistern or tank of water uncovered near any offen- 
sively smelling objects — if it is in the scullery or near a dung or dirt heap 
have it covered, but draw it off frequently, and have the cistern cleaned 
out every six months at the very least. 

Boiling water is an admirable way of purifying it, but as it becomes 
very flat afterwards by losing its carbonic acid, aerate it again by pouring 
it at as great a height as you can from one jug to another six times. It 
will then be fresh and sparkling. 

The temperature at which water is drank, is of importance in a sani- 
tary point of view. Below 45 it is an astringent : at 6o° a diluent, and 
of use for removing indigestion ; a celebrated gourmand of the Regency ; 
was accustomed to drink a wine-glass of water at 6o c after his dinner 
daily. 

Water of a temperature from 70 to 8o°, drunk the first thing in the 
morning, is an excellent antibilious dose. Water is cold at 8o° to the 
hand ; it is tepid from 86° to 90 , at ioo° it is warm, at 21 2° boiling. 

The following are some of the tests for water : — Proportion a few drops ' 
of the one used to a wine-glass or tumbler of water. 

To detect alkaline carbonates and sulphates — a solution of nitrate of 
barytes. If they are in the water it will cause a turbid appearance. 

To precipitate lime : — a solution of oxalate of ammonia. 

Free carbonic acid is detected by an appearance of milkiness when an 
equal quantity of lime water is added to the water tested. Magnesium 
waters possess the look and properties of magnesia. If the presence of 
magnesia be slight and only suspected, a solution of carbonate of am- 
monia, followed immediately by a solution of potash of soda may be used 
to test it ; if magnesia be in the water it will become milky. Water im- 
pregnated with iron is called chalybeate; and it is called sulphurous 
when impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas. 

Pure water is at its greatest density, or heaviest, at 39 of Fahrenheit, 
that is, at 7 above freezing ; if the temperature rises or falls, the water 
expands. 

Salt (sea) water may be rendered fit for washing purposes by adding 
soda to it. The soda acts by decomposing the chlorides of calcium and 
magnesium, and by supplying excess of free soda prevents the chloride of 
sodium from injuring the soap. When it is thrown in the water it will 
become cloudy, and a white precipitate will be thrown down. When it has 
settled the water may be poured off for use. 

Fermentation is a change effected in the elements of a body com- 
posed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen without nitrogen. This change 
produces alcohol and carbonic acid, and if the process be continued the 
alcohol will be changed into acetic acid or vinegar. Alcohol is, we all 
know, spirit : the carbonic acid produced by fermentation causes beer or 
ale to be brisk and sparkling ; if suffered to escape by the cask being left 
open too long, the malt liquor becomes jfo/ ; as it is called. 

H 



98 Fermentation and Putrefaction, 



Without fermentation we can have no wine nor beer ; yeast, the foam 
of beer, or of some similar liquor, is produced by fermentation, and con- 
sists of a substance called gluten, undergoing putrefaction, in which con- 
dition it possesses the property of exciting fermentation. It is the presence 
of nitrogen in it which gives yeast the power of causing fermentation, 
which cannot take place unless the gluten is in a putrefying state. 

Yeast is put into the infusion of malt called sweetwort, to make 
it into beer, because the presence of a putrefying body, containing 
nitrogen, is required to convert sugar into alcohol, and by it the sugar of 
the wort is changed into alcohol and carbonic acid, and the gluten (of 
which sweetwort contains a great deal) is changed into yeast. 

Grape-juice contains a sufficient quantity of a nitrogenized substance, 
like yeast, to produce fermentation without any external assistance. 

Fermentation in bread is produced generally by yeast, and makes the 
dough rise, from the carbonic acid gas which is evolved by it. The sticky 
texture of the " sponge" will not let this gas escape, and it forces up little 
bladders all over the dough. Heat increases fermentation and expands 
these gas bubbles, in consequence of which the dough becomes more 
porous and lighter. For this cause the cook places her dough before the 
fire to rise ; if the dough were to be removed and get cold the air bubbles 
would condense, the paste would fall, and the bread would be heavy. 

Putrefaction is a change effected in the elements of a body composed 
of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. 

At the freezing-point of water all putrefaction ceases, and also at the 
boiling-point. 

Perfectly diy substances never putrefy. 

Putrefaction cannot take place if there is no air, Air contains the 
germs of low forms of organic life. Substances can neither putrefy nor 
ferment without these infusoria being present. 

When meat becomes tainted and putrefaction has commenced, it can 
be stayed and the taint removed by washing it with pyroligneous acid, by 
covering it for a few hours with powdered charcoal, or by putting a few 
lumps of charcoal into the water in which it is boiled. Both these sub- 
stances combine with the putrescent particles and neutralize their 
offensive taste and smell. 

Meat should never be exposed to the action of moonlight, for on a 
clear moonlight night it will radiate heat freely and grow wet with dew, 
which causes rapid putrefaction. 

ELECTEICITY. 

We have already spoken of rain, hail, and snow ; it is time to discuss 
the great agent of storms — Electricity, which exists latent probably in 
nearly all terrestrial objects, and is seen in nature as lightning. 

There are two kinds of electricity — Vitreous and Resinous ; called by 
Dr. Franklin the Positive and Negative. Vitreous electricity is so called 
because it was first produced by rubbing glass : Resinous, because it was 
best procured by rubbing resinous substances. 

Electricity accumulates in the clouds from different sources : from 
evaporation from the earth's surface ; from chemical changes in the air ; 
and from friction between currents of air of unequal temperature crossing 



Thunder and Lightning. oo» 



each other. Lightning is this accumulated electricity discharged from the ' 
clouds, by one kind of electricity rushing from a cloud to unite itself withn 
the other kind, in another cloud, or in the earth. The flash parts the- 
atmosphere, and the concussion made when the air closes again, produces 
(in great part) the noise which we call thunder. When the lightning 
cloud is near the earth all the vibrations of the air (on which sound 
depends) reach the ear at the same moment, and produce one terrific 
crash. When the lightning cloud is a long way off, and some of the 
vibrations of sound have further to travel than others, the peal reaches the 
ear at intervals and is broken and irregular. The vibrations produced in 
the lowest portions of the air are heard first. The flash is instantaneous,, 
but sound takes a second of time to travel 380 yards. 

The lightning clouds are often very near the earth. They are rarely 
more than 700 yards from the surface when discharged, and the nearer 
they are the more likely they are to discharge. Any high object whictu 
reduces the distance between them and the earth, as steeples, high trees,, 
etc., will discharge them. 

Electricity passes through a conductor in a quiet and invisible form : 
when it cuts the air it becomes visible, because the atmosphere is a bad 
conductor. 




Example of the zigzag path of Lightning. 

Lightning is forked when the flash is divided by terrestrial objects 
which attract it ; it is zigzag when it condenses the air in its immediate 
path, and flies from side to side that it may pass where there is least 
resistance. When the distance a flash lias to pass is very short, the air is 
not condensed by it and the flash descends straight. 

Lightning destroys life when it passes through the body of men or 
animals, by its violent action on the nerves ; it therefore possesses a 
degree of peril for us which makes some of its properties, and the laws 
which direct it, matters of important knowledge. 

Lightning in seeking the earth will always choose the best conductors, 

H 2 



* o o Conductors and Non- Conductors. 

and will leap from a bad conductor to a good one. It also seeks a path by 
the highest object ; or rather, perhaps, it is high objects which discharge the 
electrical cloud. It is well, therefore, to know which are the conductors 
that are especially beloved by the fiery visitor. Water is an excellent 
conductor ; so are metals of all kinds. Vapour is a good conductor ; the 
body of man itself is another, the lightning passing through the human 
fluids. It is therefore unwise to stand near or under a tree in a thunder- 
storm, because the tall tree would attract the lightning, and as the man 
would be the better conductor, the flash would diverge from the tree to 
him ; but if he were at a sufficient distance the tree might save him from 
the flash, because it would be higher and would draw the lightning to itself. 

It is dangerous to lean against a wall, because the electric fluid will 
sometimes run down it, and would leave the wall for the better human 
conductor. 

All sorts of metals are good conductors, and therefore attract lightning ; 
they should not be worn at the time of a storm nor taken in the hand. 

A crowd conducts lightning, the vapour arising from it increasing the 
conducting power of the air above. 

Metals conduct in the following order : copper is the best conductor ; 
zinc is next in power ; iron next ; and lead least. 

Iron houses would be safest to inhabit, because the metal walls would 
draw the lightning from their inmates to the ground. Iron bedsteads are 
also safest in lightning storms, as they are excellent conductors, and the 
lightning would prefer the iron pathway to one through the human body. 
For the same reason the knights of old were safe in their steel armour, 
which lightning would prefer to the knight himself as a road to the earth, 
which it seeks. 

This power of conducting electricity has caused the placing of lightning 
conductors by churches, powder magazines, and other public buildings. 
But these conductors must be of proper size and kept in perfect order, as 
if broken, cracked, or defective, the electric fluid will fly from them to the 
building. It is safer not to sit near the fireplace in a thunder-storm, and 
the middle of the room is to be preferred. Mattresses and beds are 
non-conductors, and therefore afford security. Silk is a non-conductor, 
and glass ; therefore glass windows protect from lightning in a storm. 
Pieces of metal of all kinds attract it, and are dangerous. Wet is a 
protection ; wet clothes will conduct lightning from the human body, but 
it is dangerous to stand near water. 

The electric fluid makes itself felt in our dairies and cellars. It 
produces a disturbance in the condition of milk which turns it sour ; and 
if our beer be new and its fermentation not complete, lightning will so 
accelerate the process that it will turn the sugar which is not yet alcohol 
into acetic acid, and we shall have sour beer. Old beer and strong porter, 
the fermentation of which is more advanced, will be less affected, if at all. 

But lightning, in spite of its peril for us, is a beneficent agent in crea- 
tion. It is one of the great sources of heat. It purifies the air by pro- 
ducing nitric acid* in it, and by agitating the air-currents. 

* Nitric acid acts very powerfully in destroying noxious exhalations from putrid 
vegetable or animal matter. It is formed by th« electric fluid chemically uniting 
the nitrogen and oxygen of the atmosphere. 



The Barometer. 



ior 



A thunder-storm generally follows very dry weather in summer. The 
dry air being a non-conductor will not relieve the clouds of it, and they 
are at length discharged in a storm ; whereas moist air or falling rain — a 
good conductor — carries the fluid silently, and by degrees, from the clouds 
into the earth. 

THE BAROMETER. 

Two Greek words — fiapos, a weight, and fierpov, a measure — are en- 
listed to give the title to this most valuable instrument, which accurately 

demonstrates the variability of the pressure 
of the air. Mercury is about thirteen times 
heavier than water ; consequently a column 
of mercury I in. square and about 30 in. in 
height will counterbalance a column of 
water 34 ft. high and 1 in. square at the 
base, or both will hold in equipoise a 
column of air of its natural height from 
the earth, or that aerial mixture which is 
supposed to be included within a distance 
of 45 miles of the earth's surface — i.e., 
starting from the level of the sea. 

The specific gravity of air is taken as 
unity or one, and it is the standard with 
which the density of all gaseous bodies is 
compared. Air at 30 Bar. and 32 Fahr. 
is 769/4 lighter than water, and 10,462 
times less heavy than mercury. 

A barometer, for rough purposes, is soon 
made. A clean, dry tube of stout glass, 
called barometer-tube, is hermetically 
sealed at one end ; pure mercury is then 
poured in until the tube is filled within 
one inch of the open end ; the thumb is 
now held tightly over the latter, and the 
air included in the small space already 
alluded to is slowly passed up and down 
the tube, in order to collect all' the smaller 
bubbles of air which adhere to the inside 
of the glass tube. The tube, filled with 
mercury, is left standing upright, and is 
gently tapped (say daily for a week), in 
order to assist the escape of any bubbles 
of air. It is then inverted in a basin of 
clean mercury, and, supposing the tube to 
be 36 in. in length, the mercury may fall 
to 30 in., and the space between 30 in. 
and 36 in. is called the Torricellian 
vacuum. 
The barometer thus made, if placed under the receiver of an air- 
pump, indicates, by the falling of the mercury, the amount of vacuum 
procurable by any pump that the operator may wish to test ; but there

is always a fractional portion left behind, however excellent the air- 
pump may be. A pump that will remove 329 volumes out of 330 may be 
regarded as a very good one. 

The more refined instruments required for meteorological purposes are 
made in the same manner, with the additional precau- 
tion of boiling the quicksilver in the tube, so as to get 
rid of the last bubbles of air. It is this which renders 
them more costly, as many tubes are sometimes broken 
in the process of boiling. There are many good baro- 
meter-makers in London. 

The annexed figure represents a refined instrument, 
made by Negretti and Zambra, who give the following 
instructions : — 

A Standard Barometer, on Fortin's principle, reading 
fiom an ivory point in the cistern, to insure a constant 
level — with mercury boiled in the tube. The barometer- 
tube, which is T 4 5 of an inch diameter, is enclosed and 
protected by a tube of brass extending throughout its 
whole length ; the upper portion of the brass tube has 
two longitudinal openings opposite each other ; on one 
side of the front opening is the barometrical scale of 
English inches, divided to show, by means of a vernier, 
i\q of an inch ; on the opposite side is sometimes divided 
a scale of French millimetres, reading also by a vernier 
to T \j of a millimetre ; the reservoir or cistern of the 
barometer is of glass, closed at bottom by means of a 
leather bag, acted upon by a thumb-screw passing 
through the bottom of an arrangement of brass-work, by 
which it is protected. A delicate thermometer is attached 
to the brass tube. 

Directions for fixing the Barometer. — Having deter- 
mined upon the position in which to place the instru- 
ment, fix the mahogany board as nearly vertical as 
possible ; and ascertain if the barometer is perfect, and 
free from air, in the following manner : — Lower the screw 
at the bottom of cistern three or four turns, that the 
mercury in the tube, when held upright, may fall two or 
three inches from the top ; then slightly incline the in- 
strument from the vertical position, and if the mercury 
in striking the top elicit a sharp tap the instrument is 
quite perfect. If the tap be dull, or not heard at all, 
there is air above the mercury, which must be driven into 
the cistern by inverting the instrument, and gently 
tapping it with the hand. Supposing the barometer to 
be in perfect condition, it is next suspended on the brass 
bracket, its cistern passing through the ring at bottom of 
the mahogany board, and allowed to find its vertical 
position, after which it is firmly clasped by means of the 
jhree thumb-screws. 

Before making an observation, the mercury in the cistern must be 
raised or lowered, by means of the thumb-screw, until the ivory point and

its reflected image are just in contact ; the ver- 
nier is then moved by means of the milled head, 
until its lower termination just excludes the 
light from the top of the mercurial column ; the 
reading is then taken by means of the scale 
on the limb and the vernier. 

A very excellent and moderate-priced instru- 
ment is that made by Davis and Co., 163, 
Fenchurch Street. {See cut.) 

Changes in the weather are indicated by the 
barometer, or weather-glass, which was invented 
by Torricelli, a pupil of Galileo, in 1643. 

The principle by which it is made to indicate 
changes of weather is by measuring the weight 
of air. When the atmosphere is filled with 
vapour* the air is lighter than usual, and the 
column of mercury in the barometer stands low. 
When the air is dry and free from vapour it is 
heavy and the mercury stands high. 

To sailors the barometer is of the highest 
value ; it forewarns them of wind, rain, and 
storms, and thus enables them to prepare their 
vessel to meet it. An unusual and sudden fall 
in the barometer has been found frequently to 
precede a hurricane. 

The barometer is highest of all during a 
protracted frost, and rises with a north-east 
wind, and when the air is very dry. The baro- 
meter falls very low in a thaw; it falls also 
when the wind comes from the moist quar- 
ters of the south and west. When the baro- 
meter stands above 30 , no rain may be 
expected, the air is too dry for it. When the 
barometer stands very low indeed, short heavy 
showers and sudden squalls from the west may 
be expected. 

As we have said, the sudden falling of the 
barometer denotes gales of wind, or, if the 
weather be very hot, thunder. In frosty 
weather the fall of the barometer foretells an 
approaching thaw. The barometer sinks lowest 
of all for wind and rain together. In winter 
the rise of the barometer foretells frost. 

During frosty weather the rise presages 
snow. If in wet weather the barometer rises 
suddenly, the fine weather will not last. If 
the mercury fluctuates, expect changeable wea- 
ther. In short, its upward motion signifies fine 
weather ; its downward, wet or windy weather. 
The barometer is highest in May, August, 
June, March, September, and April. 



io4 Natural Signs of the Weather. 



The mercury is rising when the top of the column is convex, that is, 
higher in the middle than at the sides ; it is falling when the top of the 
column is concave, that is, when it is hollow in the middle and higher at 
the sides. 

The convex form is caused by the whole column not being able to rise 
together on account of the capillary attraction of the glass tube, which 
delays the part of the mercury which touches it, while the middle part is 
rising. The same cause — the capillary attraction of the sides of the glass 
tube — delays the fall of the sides of the column, and the centre sinks faster 
than the outside, and gives the column a concave shape at the top. 

There are many natural prognostics of coming fine or foul weather. 
A red sunset with a tint of purple in it is a harbinger of a fair morrow. For 
when the air is dry it refracts the red or heat-making rays, and as dry 
air is not perfectly transparent they are again reflected in the horizon. 

A red sunrise, on the contrary, forebodes wet. 

A yellow or coppery sunset foretells rain. The yellow colour shows 
that the vapours of the air are already condensed into clouds. The rays of 
light meet with more resistance from condensed vapour, consequently those 
which are more refracted than the red — i.e., the yellow — are bent down to 
the eye. Moist air is more transparent than dry, and allows yellow rays, 
which have less momentum than red, to pass through it. 

A grey sunrise is the harbinger of a fine day, for the air must be com- 
paratively clear and free from moisture to let all the three coloured rays 
pass together, with a slight degree of intensity, so as to produce white 
light — for grey is only a modification of white. The old proverb truly 
says : 

11 Evening red and morning grey 
Will set the traveller on his way ; 
But evening grey and morning red 
Will bring down rain upon his head." 

A morning rainbow also presages wet, because it must necessarily be 
in the west, for it is always opposite the sun, which rises in the east ; now 
rain clouds in the west almost always in this country bring bad weather. 
The old proverb is well known : 

" A rainbow in the morning is the shepherd's warning ; 
A rainbow at night is the shepherd's delight." 

The rainbow at night is in the east because the sun is in the west, and 
as it shows that the rain clouds (if they have been driven from the west) 
are leaving us, it harbingers fine weather. If the wind be easterly, how- 
ever, neither can be relied on. 

A haze round the sun and a halo round the moon both foretell rain, for 
they are each caused by very fine rain suspended in the upper regions 
of the air, which will be sure to fall at last. The larger the halo, the 
sooner rain may be expected, because the clouds are nearer. Flowers also 
give out peculiarly strong and sweet odours before rain, chiefly because the 
vapour in the air prevents their perfume from ascending. 

Swallows fly low before rain, because the insects on which they feed 
have descended from the cold regions of the air to the warmer air near 
the earth. 



Wind, as influencing Weather. 



Seagulls come to land before stormy weather, because the fish on which 
they feed leave the surface of the sea, and they are driven for food to the 
worms and larvae which in such weather come out of the ground. 

The Stormy Petrels* on the contrary go out to sea and ran along the 
top of the waves, because their food (which consists of insects) is at such 
times to be found on the surface of the water ; and their presence invaria- 
bly predicts a storm. 

" The different tribes of wading birds always migrate," says Sir 
Humphry Davy, " when rain is about to take place ; and I remember 
once in Italy, having been long waiting in the end of March for the 
arrival of the double snipe in the Campagna of Rome, a great flight 
appeared on the 3rd of April, and the day after heavy rain set in which 
greatly interfered with my sport." Sir Humphry goes on by observing 
that many popular superstitions are owing to the same causes. " For 
anglers in spring," he says, " it is always unlucky to see single magpies, 
but two may be always regarded as a favourable omen ; and the reason 
is that in cold and stormy weather one magpie alone leaves the nest 
in search of food, the other remaining sitting upon the eggs or the young 
ones ; but when two go out together it is only when the weather is warm 
and mild and favourable for fishing." 

Certain winds also influence the weather. 

Wind is air set in motion by heat or cold. The air always seeks to 
preserve an equilibrium ; therefore when hot air ascends, as it always does, 
cold air rushes into its place. Our highest winds are generally in Decem- 
ber and January ; March and November come next. The wind is stillest 
in August and September. High winds are caused in the cold months 
by the contrast between our temperature and that of the torrid zone ; for 
the greater the contrast of cold and heat, the more violently will the air 
rush in to restore the equilibrium. 

In summer when our climate is nearer in heat to that of the tropics, 
the air rushes to us with less force and velocity. 

This tendency of the air to preserve an equilibrium is one of the wisest 
laws of creation, for by it the northern regions are warmed by the hot air 
from the torrid zone, and the torrid zone air is cooled by the cold air from 
the poles. In addition to this, the air from the tropics, where great portions 
of land are covered with vast forests, is full of oxygen, while in the tem- 
perate and polar regions, fires and congregated human beings fill the air 
with carbonic acid. The mingling of the hot and cold atmospheres is 
consequently beneficial to both. The polar air currents carry carbonic 
acid to the plants of the torrid zone, while the equatorial currents carry 
oxygen to the animals of the other zones. 

The west winds coming across the Atlantic are laden with vapour, 
and on meeting with the least chill fall in rain. East winds cross the 
cold plains of the north of Europe, and as they pass chiefly over land 
do not absorb much water ; they are consequently very dry and absorb 
moisture from our air and clouds. 

The north wind is generally cold, keen, and dry, because it comes from 



* Petrelli, or little Peters, so called from the manner in which they walk or rutt 
on the top of the waves. 



io(S Sea-breezes. — Dm. 

the Arctic Regions, over mountains of snow and plains of ice, and being 
warmed by the heat of our island instantly absorbs all the moisture it 
can find. The north-east wind from the same causes is also a dry one. 
South winds are warm because they come to us over the scorching sands 
of Africa, and consequently imbibe water in large quantities as they 
cross the Mediterranean and English Channel ; as soon as they react 
our colder climate they are condensed — can no longer hold their vapour 
in solution — and it falls as rain. 

Sea breezes are very salubrious, both on account of the constituent 
elements of the sea air, and because they are not laden with noxious 
vapours ; this is especially the case in the morning, when the cool air from 
the sea, which has never been heated as the land breeze has, creeps inland 
to restore the equilibrium of the air by pressing the light hot air up- 
wards. 

Land breezes are coolest of an evening because the surface of the land 
cools down after sunset more quickly than the surface of the sea, therefore 
the air from the land feels cooler than that from the sea. Islands are 
warmer in winter than continents, because the warmth of the sea air miti- 
gates the cold of the land air. 

Dew is condensed vapour from the air. It is condensed by coming 
in contact with bodies colder than itself. In summer there is much dew 
because the hot earth radiates or throws off heat freely and the air does 
not ; consequently after sunset the earth is often many degrees colder than 
the air, and the warm vapour of the air which touches it is chilled and con- 
densed into dew. Clouds arrest the radiation of heat from the earth, conse- 
quently on dull cloudy evenings and nights there is no dew. In conse- 
quence of the clouds preventing the radiation of heat from the earth, the 
surface of the ground retains its warmth and a cloudy night becomes closer 
and hotter than a fine clear one. Any covering prevents the radiation of 
heat from the earth, therefore if an awning be spread out of doors there 
will be little or no dew under it, even if it should be open at the sides. It 
is a knowledge of this principle which enables us to protect trees from the 
frost. Any covering prevents the radiation of heat from the tree ; and if 
trees are not cooled down by radiation the air-vapour will not be frozen 
when it comes in contact with them. A thin covering of muslin is there- 
fore sufficient to prevent them from being struck by the frost. But the 
bass or canvas usually employed to cover fruit trees is always drenched 
with dew itself, because it radiates heat both upwards and downwards, 
and in consequence is so cooled that it readily condenses the air-vapour 
into dew. 

Leaves of plants and grass radiate heat very freely, and by doing so 
condense the vapour of the air into dew very easily ; thus they supply their 
great need of moisture in dry weather. 

Polished metal and smooth stones do not radiate heat well, and conse- 
quently scarcely get any dew by condensing the air-vapour. Thus only 
the things which require dew, make it. 

Radiation is carried on very rapidly on bright moonlight nights ; dew 
is consequently largely deposited on young plants and trees, and thus their 
growth is promoted. 

Evening dew is always laden with exhalations from the earth which 
are injurious to health ; it should therefore be avoided. 



Weather-toys. — Magnetism 



107 



There are certain small weather-toys which admirably supply the place 
of the barometer where the expense of the latter prevents purchasing it. 
The capuchin is one ; in this the monk's cowl is on when rain is coming, 
but is taken off when it is fine. This is caused by the catgut which is at- 
tached to it ; being shortened by moisture it pulls the cowl up. In dry 
weather the string expands and the cowl falls by its own weight. In the 
other toys, where a man and a lady, or a knight and a jester, etc., come 
out alternately, the same principle acts ; the moist catgut sending out the 
man, or knight, as it may be. 



MAGNETISM. 

The magnetic or black oxide of iron, sometimes called the lead- 
stone or loadstone, is estimated as one of the most valuable ores of iron, 
because it enjoys the property, when freely suspended, of pointing to 
the north ; and it does this by virtue of an inherent property which 
belongs to it, called magnetism. 




The Shepherd discovering the Magnetic Stone on Mount Ida 
with the Iron 01 his Crook. 

The loadstone occurs native, and crystallizes in cubes, and is said to 
have been discovered by a shepherd on Mount Ida, who first noticed that 
the iron of his crook was attracted by it. 

The magnet was not only called magnes, but " lapis Heracleus," from 
Heraclea, a city of Magnesia, a part of ancient Lydia, in Greece. It is 



10S Home Use of Magnet. 



also called lapis nauticns, because of its use in navigation ; and siderites, 
because the mineral attracts iron, which the Greeks called aidrjpos. 

" The earliest mention in English records of the primitive mariners 
compass is that by Alexander Neckham, who describes the same in his 
' Treatise on Things pertaining to Ships.' Neckham was born at St. 
Alban's in 1157. A translation of his works from the Latin, was published 
in 1866. In the reign of Edward III., the magnet was known by the 
name of the sail-stone or adamant, and the compass was called the sail- 
ing-needle or dial ; it is long after this period before we find the word 
compass. A ship called the Plenty sailed from Hull in 1388, and we find 
that she was steered by the sailing-stone. In 1345, another entry occurs of 
one of the king's ships, called the George, bringing over sixteen horologes 
from Sluys, and that money had been paid at the same place for twelve 
stones, called adamants or sail-stones, for repairing divers instruments 
pertaining to a ship." 

Fine large pieces of loadstone are usually mounted in handsome brass 
or silver boxes, and were highly prized in the reign of King Charles II., 
when the Royal Society of England began to exert itself in the acquisi- 
tion of scientific knowledge. 

When examined with a magnetic needle, the mineral is found to have 
two points where the magnetic virtue exists in the greatest intensity : these 
are called poles, and are connected with the pieces of soft iron which pro- 
trude from the case containing the loadstone ; they take off the friction 
and wear and tear of the mineral, whilst all cutting of the stone, in order 
to obtain a hollow space between the two poles, as in an ordinary horse- 
shoe magnet, is avoided. The magnetism from the loadstone is easily 
conferred upon and retained by hardened steel. 

It is only necessary to rub the steel or drag the loadstone round in one 
direction, taking care to put the pole N of the latter on the end of the 
steel bar marked S. An assemblage of steel plates in the form of an 
elongated horseshoe, when carefully magnetized and fixed together, con- 
stitutes a kind of magnetic battery having greatly increased powers. 

Every housemother should possess a small magnet. In case of a 
morsel of needle or any steel dust getting into the eye, a magnet held to 
it will draw the offending substance out. A niece of the writer broke a 
large carpet needle into her foot. A surgeon was called in ; he endea- 
voured to extract it, cut the foot deeply, but could not succeed in reaching 
the needle. Some days afterwards, at the suggestion of a friend's nurse, 
she tried holding a strong horse-shoe magnet to it, drawing it backwards 
and forwards over the place till the needle, obeying the attraction, 
appeared on the surface. She then squeezed it upwards, and passing 
another needle through the eye, drew it out.

THE HOUSE-MOTHER. 

The house taken and furnished, the duties of the housewife or— we 
prefer giving her the expressive name employed by our German cousins, 
— the House-mother — begin, and first, perhaps, in her list of many duties 
comes feeding the family. In order to do this judiciously and economi- 
cally, she should know everything about the articles on which we feed, 
— their powers of sustaining life and health — the mode of using and 
preserving them, and their price. We give, therefore, a brief summary of 
the chief food used in English families, and some hints respecting the pro- 
visions for the larder found in the colonies. This book does not however 
pretend to be a cookery book ; for instructions in that art the reader is re- 
ferred to Warne's " Model Cookery Books," which range from the first-class 
volume, price Js. 6d., to the poor house-mother's guide at a penny. 

The house-mother has duties separate from those of the cook. One of 
these is a knowledge of the nature and character of the food which the 
latter prepares. We offer her in the following pages some guidance in 
this direction ; and also we insert some few receipts which from their ex- 
cellence, and their being chiefly original and not to be met with elsewhere, 
we think may be usefuL They will be found at the end of the description 
of the article of food to which they refer. 

POOD. 

The use of food is to repair the waste daily and hourly going on in our 
bodies, and to enable us to execute the work for which the body was de- 
signed ; also, as we have shown in the first pages of Domestic Science, to 
keep the lamp of life burning by supporting the animal heat. 

To keep a man living and able to work he will require daily five ounces 
of nitrogenous or flesh-forming food, and ten ounces of calorific matter 
or carbon, for heat-giving or breathing. Women and schoolboys require 
two and a half ounces of flesh-formers, and about three-fourths of the 
man's amount of carbon, or heat-givers.* 

" This large quantity of starch or fat is required by a full-grown man 
daily, in order that he may continue to breathe, and yet retain the weight 
of his body undiminished. 

" That all bodily movement is attended by waste of the bodily sub- 
stance is a received opinion. But whether such movement is or is not its 
true cause, the waste itself is certain. An animal when fasting will lose 
from a fourteenth to a twelfth of its whole weight in twenty-four hours. 
This loss does not fall altogether upon the fat" — which supplies the animal 
heat — " but extends also in part to the tissues and general substance of 
the body. It is so great that the whole blood is unable altogether to re- 
place it. Scarcely, therefore, is the stomach of an animal empty, when it 
begins already to feed upon itself." 

The food required by the body consists of gluten, fibrin, albumen, 
starch, fat, sugar, and saline matters. 

* On the authority of the South Kensington Museum. 



no Food. 

Gluten will be readily detected in the dough of bread if it be placed on 
a sieve and turned about by the hand under a stream of water poured 
from a jug on it. The water at first passes through milky in appearance ; 
at last there will remain at the bottom of the sieve a white sticky sub- 
stance resembling bird-lime. This matter from its glutinous nature has 
been called " gluten." 

If the milky water be allowed to stand, a white powder will sink as a 
sediment in it, which is wheaten starch. 

Gluten contains nitrogen, the kind of air or gas which forms the greater 
part of the atmosphere. The fibrin of meat, and the albumen or white of 
an egg, also contain nitrogen nearly in the same proportion as gluten. In 
these three similar substances, therefore, the nutritive or flesh-forming 
parts of our food are chiefly found. We must observe here, that albumen 
in pla,7its is not the same as the albumen which is the white of an egg. It 
is the white inner part of the seed on which the plants feed, as the 
chicken does on the albumen in the egg. Albumen, though different in 
appearance and sensible properties from gluten and fibrin has, as we have 
just said, a close chemical relation to both and serves nearly the same 
Durpose in feeding animals. Gluten, fibrin, and albumen are all alike 
nutritive and flesh-forming. 

Next in order come the heat-givers, or those substances which by 
keeping up the internal combustion always going on within, enable us to 
breathe and live — they are the fats and oils, sugars and starch. Human 
fat feeds the animal heat in combination with the oxygen of the air. It 
(human fat) consists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and is transformed 
into carbonic acid and water by the oxygen in the air we breathe. This 
oxygen taken into the blood circulates through our bodies, unites with the 
carbon and hydrogen of the fat, and changes it into carbonic acid and 
water, to be breathed off again through the lungs. 

Now starch and sugar will take the place of the animal fat, and 
thus prevent its diminution. They will be breathed away instead of the 
fat of the animal itself. Ardefit spirits, which consist of four parts of car- 
bon, six of hydrogen, and two of oxygen, have the same power of sup- 
plying carbonic acid gas for breathing. Starch consists of half its 
weight in carbon, and hydrogen and oxygen in the proportions which 
form water — i.e., eight parts of oxygen to one part of hydrogen. It pro- 
duces when oxidized (that is, united with oxygen) in the system of man, 
muscular force and animal heat, but it is not either a flesh or muscle former. 

Arrowroot, which is a starch, cannot therefore form alone the food of 
man, who on such a diet would die of slow starvation. 

No vegetable production will preserve life unless starch and glute?i be 
united in it. 

Wheaten bread will support life, but it lacks fat, required for repairing 
the waste of animal fat, and to help digestion ; and we consequently 
eat butter with it. We make tart and pie crusts with butter, lard, or 
dripping, for the same reason, wheaten flour being deficient in fat ; in fact 
to most vegetables we require to add fat. 

Woody fibre will be always found amongst the constituents of vege- 
table food ; it passes through the animal undigested. 

The following table of flesh-formers, each sufficing for the daily food 
of a man, is given from the Food Gallery of the South Kensington

"All parts of the body," says Professor Johnston, "are endowed with 
the power of selecting from the universally nourishing blood the chemical 
compounds which are specially required for the formation of their own 
substance, or the discharge of their special functions. Thus the bones 
specially select and appropriate phosphate of lime, while the muscles take 
phosphate of magnesia and phosphate of potash. The cartilages build in 
soda in preference to potash. The bones and teeth specially extract 
fluorine. Silica is almost monopolized by the hair, skin, and nails of 

man Iron abounds chiefly in the colouring matter of the blood, in 

the black pigment of the eye, and in the hair. Sulphur exists largely in 
the hair, and phosphorus in the brain. Thus to each part of the body 
certain chemical substances seem to be most specially appropriated, and 
to each part a peculiar and special power has been given of selecting out 
of the common storehouse those materials which suit it best to work withal.*'* 

These materials are supplied in our food, and care should be taken by 
the housewife that bad cooking and injudicious arrangements may not 
cause the needful substances to be wanting from the food supplied. 

We shall now endeavour to guide her judgment in the choice and 
preservation of food, commencing with a little information respecting the 
staff of life — our daily bread. 

Bread, and the Grains used for making it. 
The various kinds of flour used for ordinary English bread are- 
Wheat Flour, Oatmeal, Barley-meal, Indian-meal. 

Wheat-flour is sold by millers, and all of these grains are sold at corn* 
chandlers.

There are many kinds of foreign wheat. 

Flour of every kind consists of two classes of substances — one nitro- 

gcnized, the other non-nitroge- 
nized. It also contains mineral 
substances. 

The gluten is the substance of 
most importance in flour, as it con- 
tains, in its crude state, most of the 
other nitrogenized substances — viz., 
fibrine, mucine or caseine, and oil. 
The greater part of the oil is con-

tained in the bran, or husk, as are also the phosphates. The nitrogenized 
substances — pure gluten, vegetable fibrin, caseine, and oil, serve to form 
in the human body flesh or muscle through the agency of the blood into 
which they first enter ; the starch, sugar, and gum are used for forming 
fat and carrying on respiration. 

It will be seen, by comparison with the following tables, that the 
nitrogenized, or flesh-forming substances, are in larger proportion in wheat 
than in any other grain, consequently wheaten bread is the most econo- 
mical in the end. 

Before grinding, several sorts of wheat are mixed together, as the 
mixture makes better bread than any single kind alone. The process of 
mixing is called " mealing." 

After the wheat is mixed, it is carefully winnowed from the dust, and 

then descends through a hopper (a) to the space be- 
tween two mill-stones (b). These are about four or 

live feet in diameter, and are made of a very hard 

French stone — called French burr-stone. 

The burr-stones are not often brought to this 

country much larger than a man's hat — a number 

of them are, therefore, carefully cemented together 

with a very strong cement, and bound with iron 

hoops to form one mill-stone. The method that is 

employed in France to split the burr-stones to 

the requisite thickness, is rather singular. Cir- 
cular indentations are made round the blocks,

at proper distances, and then wedges of willow that have been dried in 
an oven are driven into the indentations with a mallet. When these 
wedges have been sunk to a proper depth they are moistened with water; 
and, after a few hours, the several stones that have been marked out are 
found to be perfectly separated. The surfaces of the stones are rough or 
grooved, and the lower one being fixed, the upper one revolves rapidly — 
more than a hundred times in a minute. 

It is necessary to keep the stones a little distance apart, for if they 
touched they would grow very hot. This is effected by a strong spindle 
being put through a small hole in the lower stone, which turns the upper 
mill-stone. By raising or lowering the spindle the upper stone is raised 
Or lowered. The centrifugal force drives the flour from the centre to the 
circumference, where it falls into a box. The upper stone is slightly 
concave, therefore the broken grain can gradually find its way outwards, 
being ground in its passage. A blast of cold air is directed on the stone 
to keep it cool. 

The flour descends through a spout into a bin below, after which it is 
" dressed" — i.e., sifted through a sieve, which varies in fineness. 




Finest flour. Fine. Coarse. Bran. 

A spindle through the middle of the sieve, has brushes fastened to it. 
When the flour is in, the brushes revolve swiftly, and rub the flour through 
the sieve — the bran falling out at the end. By an exhausting or pumping 
apparatus, the loose flour dispersed in the air by the blast is collected and 
saved from waste.

The pollards are sold for feeding pigs and poultry, the bran for horses 
and cattle ; three kinds of flour remain for the bakehouse— -firsts, for fine 
wheaten bread ; seconds for household bread ; thirds, for brown bread. 

The flour, when ground, is placed in sacks ; each sack contains five 
bushels, that is, 280 lbs. The bushel is divided again into four pecks. In 
some English counties BREAD is measured by the gallon— in Hants, for ex- 
ample. In London, and generally in England, by the 41b., or quartern loaf.

very excellent — it is sold in barrels* Seconds are quite good enough for 
ordinary bread ; firsts are required for pastry. The whole meal should be 
used for making bread, as the phosphates of wheat necessary for forming 
bone are contained in it. It is said, on high medical authority, that the 
decay in the teeth amongst young people, so much more prevalent than it 
was a century ago, proceeds from our never eating anything but the finest 
flour. A mixture of bran also assists digestion. 

The whole meal is obtained by simply grinding the grain without 
sifting it : it is not only best for nourishment, but would effect a great 
saving if used. 

Flour is fearfully adulterated, the usual substances used for the pur- 
pose being pea and bean meal, potato-flour, plaster of Paris, bone-dust 
and alum. In purchasing flour, it is wise to take up a handful and make 
a ball of it. If it holds together well for a little while the flour is probably 
pure. Plaster of Paris may be detected by its great weight. Observe in 
your toast whether there is any scent of bean or pea, while the toast is 
hot. Nitric and muriatic acid will also test the purity of flour ; if it is not 
adulterated nitric acid will turn it orange colour, and muriatic acid will 
change it to a deep violet colour.

Oats grow in England, but are much finer and better when grown in 
Scotland. In the husk, they are used chiefly as food for horses. The 
potato-oat has been long in cultivation. It yields the very best quality 
known to English agriculture. The husk removed, the grain is called 
groats, and is used for making gruel. Ground to a flour, it is called oat- 
meal. Oatmeal is the chief food of the Scottish peasantry, and it is 
nourishing and excellent, both when made into porridge and cakes ; it 
cannot be made into bread. The outer husk, unlike that of wheat, is poor 
in albuminoid matters, so that oatmeal is better than the whole oat. Oat- 
meal is rich in fat. 



* Dr. Poleck has instituted a series of researches with the view of ascertaining 
the cause of the difference exhibited by flour preserved in casks, and that kept in 
bags, the former of which often obtains a peculiar smell. He found that the 
gluten of flour exhibiting that peculiar smell had been, in a great measure, con- 
verted into a soluble modification, whereby the flour had lost the capability of 
being converted into a good dough, the flour also having assumed a sour reaction. 
He ascribes the cause of this change to want of a sufficient circulation of air 
through the mass of the flour kept in casks, the innermost flour in which was 
most sour and gave off the peculiar, somewhat mouldy smell. It was also found 
that with this change in the flour coincides an increase of the albuminous com- . 
pounds therein soluble in water. — Chemical News.

A bushel of oats weighs 39 to 41 lbs. They are sold generally, how- 
ever, as oatmeal, on account of the great waste occasioned by the thick 
husk in grinding. Oatmeal is sold by the cwt. or ton. Oats are the best

Barley is used in its natural state for feeding poultry, and constitutes 
the material for making malt. When threshed, the grain is called Scotch 
barley ; further prepared, pearl-barley ; carefully ground, patent barley ; 
or, less prepared, barley-meal, which makes agreeable cakes. 

The chief value of barley, however, is that it furnishes the malt for our 
beers. 

Malt is procured from barley in the following manner :— 

The maltster moistens his barley and spreads it on the floor of a dark 
room to heat and sprout. When the germ is about to burst from its 
envelope, he stops the growth by drying the grain gently on the floor of 
his kiln. It is then called malted barley, and has a sweet taste. The 
starch of the barley is changed into soluble grape-sugar ; the gluten into 
a white soluble substance, called diastase. 

The maltster has only taken advantage of the chemistry of nature with 
respect to a growing plant. The grain consists of two principal sub- 
stances — starch and gluten. When moistened by the rain and dew, the 
grain begins to sprout ; the starch and gluten are intended to feed the 
young plant, but they cannot be dissolved in water, so in their natural 
state they cannot pass out of the body of the seed to nourish the growing 
germ. Therefore, as the sprouting proceeds, a chemical change in them 
has been wonderfully ordained. This change takes place at the bottom 
of the germ, exactly where the starch and gluten are needed for food. 
The gluten is changed into diastase (among other products) ; the starch 
again is changed by the diastase mixing with it, into grape-sugar, which is 
soluble in the sap, and therefore can be carried up as food for the young 
plant. We all know that sprouting corn is sweet. 

The maltster retains the germ just in this chemical condition, and 
uses for beer the substance which nature provides for the growing plant. 

One pound of diastase is sufficient to change a thousand pounds of 
starch into grape-sugar. 

The malt is ready, when thus prepared, for the mash-tub. 

By a further and very familiar chemical process it is turned into beer. 

Barley is deficient in crude gluten. 

Barlev-meal makes more fat and less muscle than Wheat-flour.

Indian-corn meal is made from Maize, or Indian Corn, and is sold as 
polenta, and when coarsely bruised as hominy. Polenta makes very nice 
and nutritious bread, at a much lower price than Wheat-flour. The 
taste is very sweet and peculiar. It has less gluten than wheat and more 
oil, therefore it makes more fat but less muscle. 

Many very nice cakes may be made from Indian-corn. 

The method of making bread from Indian-corn (in conjunction with 
wheat-Hour) is given in Warne's " Model Cookery Book," 

Indian-meal is very nutritious.

Rye makes a light spongy bread like wheat, and it is very nearly 
as nutritive as wheaten bread. Rye bread possesses one valuable 
quality, it retains its moisture and freshness for a long time, and can be 
kept for months without becoming hard, dry, and unpalatable. This arises 
from peculiar properties possessed by its gluten. The Swedes are enabled 
therefore to keep rye-cakes strung on rods under the roof of their dwellings 
till required,

Buckwheat flour is nearly as nutritious as wheaten flour, and makes 
excellent cakes. They are eaten in the backwoods of America hot and 
5Preac| with maule honey. 



i-° Buckwheat Cakes. — Bread. 



American Buckwheat Cakes. 

One quart of buckwheat flour, one heaped-up dessert spoonful of 
Borwick's baking powder, a little salt. Enough water to make a batter. 

Make a batter of the above ingredients ; put a very little dripping or 
butter in a frying-pan, hardly greasing the pan. Drop in portions of the 
batter, and fry. When the cakes look full of little holes turn them. Send 
them to table very hot. They are eaten with butter or golden syrup. 

Half the above quantity suffices for a small family. 

Wheaten Bread. 

If flour be mixed with sufficient water, the particles will cohere and 
form a smooth elastic substance called dough. When a little yeast is added 
to the flour before, or as it is being mixed with the water, and the dough is 
placed for an hour or two near the fire, the warmth will cause the yeast to 
make it ferment, or rise, as cooks say — that is, it will swell up. This 
fermentation is the consequence of the peculiar action which yeast exer- 
cises over moist flour. It first changes a part of the starch which is in the 
flour into sugar, and then turns this sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid, 
in exactly the same way as it does in the worts of the brewer or spirit 
distiller. Therefore, when the poorer classes objected to unfermented 
bread as being " without its gin," they were scientifically correct, although 
the greater part of the alcohol escapes during the baking of the loaf, and 
is actually lost in the oven. The carbonic acid gas, unable to make its 
way out through the glutinous dough, forms large bubbles within it and 
makes it swell, till the heat of the oven at last kills the yeast plant, when 
the fermentation suddenly ceases ; this takes place when the heat reaches 
the boiling-point— 212° ; till then heat assists the fermentation. 

New bread is very soft and pleasant, though from its spongy nature it 
is thought indigestible. In a day or two it becomes stale and will crumble. 
It can be made as fresh as ever again, however, by just dipping it in 
water and exposing it again to the heat of an oven, or treating it in a closely 
covered tin. The same effect is produced without wetting the bread, if the 
heat to which it is subjected is at 21 2°. 

The bread we eat is nearly one-half water, for the flour contains water 
naturally, and absorbs much more in its conversion into bread. One 
hundred pounds of wheaten flour take up fifty pounds weight of water, and 
yield one hundred and fifty pounds of bread. The water does not eva- 
porate from the bread in the oven and the air, as much as we might 
expect, because the gluten, or flour, is difficult to dry, and retains the 
water ; part of the starch is converted into gum, and also holds it, and 
the crust of the loaf, which is dry and thick, retains the moisture within it. 
Wheaten bread contains in due proportions — water, gluten, starch, sugar, 
and gum. 

By making bread at home we save the weight of water used in making 
each loaf, a very considerable economy in a large family.

THE YEAST PLANT. 



The yeast with which we raise our bread is a minute plant belonging 
to the division of the Conferva. It grows in certain substances — iiTthe 
juice of ripe grapes, in the syrup of sugar-cane, in beer, etc. etc. " The 
minuteness of the yeast plant," says Professor Johnston in his admirable 
" Chemistry of Common Life," (to which we refer our readers for much 
valuable information), " the minuteness of the yeast plant, consisting in its 
simplest form of only a single cell, long prevented it from being generally 
regarded as a form of living matter. But the changes it undergoes in the 
fermenting tub, day by day, as shown by the microscope, prove it to be un- 
questionably a growing vegetable."* 

"If we filter the juice of ripe grapes we obtain a clear transparent 
liquid. Within half an hour this liquid begins to grow first cloudy, and 
afterwards thick ; to give off bubbles of gas or to ferment ; and in three 
hours a greyish yellow layer of yeast has collected on its surface. In the 
heat of the fermentation the plants are produced by millions ; a single 
cubic inch of such yeast, free from adhering water, containing 52,000,000 
of the minute organisms." 

Yeast has the power of changing sujar into alcohol or pure spirit, and 
of raising bread by fermentation. 

Distillers do not wait for the natural appearance of the plant ; they add 
a little existing yeast to the liquor as socn as it is ready for fermentation, 
because they know how swiftly this mysteious plant will grow and propa- 
gate itself. The making of yeast is one branch of business itself now. 
It is sold as dry yeast for the use of the private baker or brewer. The 
process is thus given in the " Chemistry of Common Life," vol. i. p. 86. 

" Crushed rye is mashed with the propei quantity of barley-malt, and 
the wort when made cooled to the proper temperature. For every hun- 
dred pounds of the crushed grain, there are now added half a pound of 
carbonate of soda and six ounces of oil of viviol (sulphuric acid) diluted 
with much water, and the wort is then brougit into fermentation by the 
addition of yeast. From the strongly fermentinr liquid the yeast is skim- 
med off and strained through a hair-sieve into ctld water, through which 
it is allowed to settle. It is afterwards washed wih one or two waters, and 
finally pressed in cloth-bags till it has the consistency of dough. It has a 
pleasant fruity smell, and in a cool place may bt. kept for two or three 
weeks. It then passes into a putrefying decomposition, acquires the odour 
of decaying cheese, and like decaying cheese, has now the property of 
changing sugar into lactic acid, instead of into alcohol is before. A hundred 
pounds of crushed grain will yield six to eight poinds of the pressed 
yeast. It is made largely at Rotterdam, and is imputed thence to this 
country through Hull." 

Many families prefer making their own yeast to buyhg the German or 
patent yeast. We give three receipts for so doing in the ne;t page. Brewer's 
yeast is apt sometimes to be bitter — yeast from porter 's always so ; to 
prevent the bitterness spoiling the bread, it is well to put a red hot poker 



Chemistry of Common Life," vol. i. p. 29,

for a minute or two into the yeast, or to threw in a few blades of grass 
which can afterwards be strained off, but except in the country or where 
the family brews at home, brewer's yeast is seldom used ; the German and 
patent yeasts are used. The dried yeasts consist of the sporules of the 
yeast plant, freed from gas and moisture by filtering or evaporating away 
the fermented liquid. When required for making, this yeast is dissolved 
in lukewarm water. A common method of drying yeast is to dip twigs in 
the yeast and dry them in the air ; or the yeast is stirred round with a 
whisk till it is thin, and then spread with a brush over a clean piece of 
board, and dried in the air. When it is dry more yeast is brushed over it. 
and it is again dried. This process is repeated till the yeast is a good 
thickness on the board. It may be kept on it, and cut off as required. 

Both brewer's yeast and artificial yeasts must be kept in a cool cellar 
or any very cold place to preserve them good.

The Ovin. — Mixing the Dough. 123 



Yeast may be preserved by mixing it while yet moist with powdered 
sugar. The yeast ought not to contain too much water, and there should 
be enough sugar added to make a thick syrup of the whole. A deficiency 
in the quantity of sugar, and an abundance of water, are likely to bring 
about a fermentation in hot weather. It has been recently proposed to 
mix pure glycerine with the yeast, instead of sugar. The efficiency of the 
preparation was tested, and found to be good after four months' preserva- 
tion in winter. 

THE OVEN. 

The best oven for baking bread is the brick oven; but bread can be 
made at home and baked in the iron oven by the side of the fire, if good 
care be taken in the operation. There is an Italian expedient for baking 
bread, which we venture to suggest to ladies who possess only an iron 
oven. The peasants of Italy bake their loaves in flower-pots, or rather in 
bowls of a similar material in their charcoal fires. Now if the dough be 
put into a nice new flower-pot of the size preferred, and the bread 
baked in it {in the iron oven), the bread will bake quite as well as in a 
brick oven, because the heat will be graduated in the same way, and both 
sides of the loaf, if turned carefully, will be equally well done. 

In heating a brick oven fagots of brushwood are used as fuel, or quick- 
burning coal, which leaves little ash. The oven should be heated for about 
thirty or thirty-five minutes, then the fuel should be taken out, the floor 
swept, and the door closely shut to diffuse the heat for about twenty- 
five minutes before the loaves are put in. 

The right heat can be ascertained thus : it is not too hot if the hand 
can be held in it (not of course touching the bricks) whilst counting 
twenty. An oven can be generally heated in one hour ; sometimes in 
even less. 

MIXING THE DOUGH. 

Put seven pounds of flour into a deep pan ; heap it round the sides, 
and leave a hollow in the centre ; pour into it a quart of milk-warm water, 
a large spoonful of salt, and half a gill of yeast ; have ready three pints 
more of warm water and, using it as you require it, make the whole into 
rather a soft dough, kneading it with both hands ; when it is smooth and 
shining strew a little flour on it ; lay a thickly-folded cloth over it, and set 
it in a warm place by the fire for four or five hours ; then knead it again 
for a quarter of an hour. In order to knead properly flour the hands, and 
folding the fingers over the thumb make a fist, and beat and pummel the 
dough on every side ; work it till it ceases to stick to your hands. Bread 
cannot be kneaded too much. Cover it over and set it to rise again. Divide 
it into two or four loaves, and bake in a quick oven. The quantities can 
be increased as required. In cold weather bread should be made in a 
warm room, and not allowed to become cold while rising. If it does not 
rise well set the pan over a bucket of boiling water. 

Brown bread can be made from three parts of seconds flour, fourth 
part of rye, a little milk, and the due quantity of water required for 
mixing. 

Bread may be made without yeast if the following ingredients be used: — 
One stone of fine flour, two ounces of carbonate of soda, one and a half 



124 Potato Bread. 



ounce of tartaric acid. Mix this flour with cold water, and the usual allow- 
ance of salt, and put the dough into the oven directly it is made — a pint 
of cold water to two pounds of the flour. 

Quartern loaves take on an average about two hours to bake ; half- 
quarterns nearly an hour and a half. Bread may be made also with the 
addition of rice, Indian-meal, potatoes, and sago to the flour in the fol- 
lowing proportions of mixture : — one and a half of rice to fourteen pounds 
of flour ; seven pounds of Indian-meal to fourteen pounds of flour ; five 
pounds of potatoes to fourteen pounds of flour ; one pound of sago to 
fourteen pounds of flour. These mixtures cheapen the bread considerably. 
Indian-meal is the best mixture, as it is nearly as nourishing as wheaten 
flour, but rice and potatoes are not nourishing ; they do not supply the 
wants of the system, because they have very little of the nitrogenized 
principle which makes muscle and bone, but if meat be eaten in sufficient 
quantity, potato and rice bread will suffice for the family needs ; wheaten 
bread, however, being always the best. 

Potato Bread. 

This is one of the best varieties of mixed or cheap bread when it is 
made with care, as its flavour is excellent, and it remains moist longer than 
any other except rice-bread ; but the potatoes used for it should be good, 
thoroughly boiled, well dried afterwards (by having the water poured from 
them, and then standing by the side of the fire to steam), and reduced to a 
perfect paste by mashing, or by rubbing quickly through a colander or 
other coarse strainer. They should be perfectly mixed with the flour or 
meal while they are still warm, and after the addition of rather more salt 
than for common bread. The dough, which will require less liquid than 
wheaten dough, should be made smoothly and firmly and be managed 
afterwards like other bread, but be baked in a more gentle oven. Seven 
pounds of potatoes weighed after they are cooked and peeled may be 
added to each gallon of meal or flour. Should it be necessary from cir- 
cumstances that cannot be controlled, to use such as are watery, the 
moisture may be partly wrung from them in a warm thick cloth before 
they are mixed with the other ingredients* 

Unfermented bread is made according to Dr. Pereira as follows : — 
Flour, one pound ; bicarbonate of soda, forty grains ; cold water, half a 
pint ; muriatic acid, forty drops. 

Aerated bread is made by putting flour into an iron box, moistening it 
with water into which carbonic acid gas has been forced, and kneading it 
by machinery inside the box. In ten minutes the dough is ready for baking. 

Baking powders are also used instead of yeast. The common propor- 
tions of these powders are one part of tartaric acid, two of carbonate of 
soda, four of potato flour, and a little turmeric powder to give a yellow tint. 

When mixed with flour and wetted they effervesce and diffuse the car- 
bonic acid through the dough, as yeast does.f

Oaten , Barley, and Sago Bread. 125 

Oaten bread requires to make it warm water, a good deal of yeast, and 
much kneading — but it is not good. 

Barley bread takes less yeast. 

We need scarcely observe that a piece of sour dough will act instead 
of yeast, and leaven the bread ; but the bread has always an acid taste. 

The water used for bread making should be soft water, if it can be had, 
well-filtered. The more water used the looser the dough will be, and if 
baked in tins it will be the lighter, or bran water is excellent, adding quite 
one-fifth to the bread. It is prepared thus :— Boil three pounds of bran 
in water for every twenty-eight pounds of flour you mean to use ; boil it 
for an hour ; strain the water off through a hair sieve, and use it for mix- 
ing the flour. 

Sago Bread. 

Sago is procured from the sago palm. The meal is extracted from the 
pith by rubbing it to powder, and then washing it with water in a sieve. 

It makes alone a kind of bread or hard cake, and is the chief food of 
the inhabitants of New Guinea, and parts of the African coast. It is 
stated that two and a half pounds of sago bread will suffice for daily food 
for a healthy man. 

For numerous receipts for bread, cake, and biscuit making we refer the 
reader to Warne's " Model Cookery Book." 

Flour should be kept in a chest or bin in a dry place. A good tin bin 
is better than a wooden one ; it is drier, and is proof against vermin. 

Grown flour, as it is called, is the flour of wheat which, in consequence 
of much rain, has germinated in the field before it could be harvested. 
Our readers will understand from what we have before said on the subject 
(seep. 118), that the effect of germination is to change the gluten into 
diastase, which converts the starch of the flour into sugar. Now flour 
deprived of gluten cannot retain carbonic acid gas, and yeast consequently 
cannot act on it ; therefore grown flour makes only heavy and indigestible 
bread. We should, of course, never purchase it ; but supposing that we 
are in a wild land where we sow and reap, harvest and grind for ourselves, 
it is well to know that our grown wheat may be used. It riiust be kiln- 
dried before grinding ; the flour should have forty grains of carbonate of 
magnesia to the pound of flour added to it, if very bad. Bread made of 



of carbonate of soda, and six ounces of tartaric acid : this last ingredient must be 
beaten in a mortar, or crashed with a rolling-pin, to make it as fine and smooth as 
possible before adding it to the rest. The whole is to be passed through a sieve, 
and kept in a dry place for use, in a glass bottle with a wide mouth. In using 
mix with cold water, and put the dough made instantly into the oven. Or, 

Two ounces of tartaric acid, three ounces of bicarbonate of soda, and three 
ounces of potato flour. Mix, by passing them through a dry sieve altogether. 

Baking Powder for Hot Rolls. — Six ounces of carbonate of soda, four 
ounces of tartaric acid, two ounces of finely powdered and sifted sugar, one ounce 
of salt ; mix well. After the flour is made dough with milk, add one teaspoonful 
of the powder to every pound of flour, knead it well in. The powder is kept for 
use well corked up. 



126 Weights of Bread. — Bran. 

grown flour requires the oven to be extra hot, and the bread must be eaten 
when quite stale. In the north of Sweden where the sun often refuses to 
fully ripen the grain, it is exposed to dry in the sun and air on a rack 
which is to be found outside most houses, and where it becomes fit for 
use, though cut before it is quite ripe. 

French Bread. 

Two quarts of flour, scald one pint of it ; butter, half the size of an 
egg ; mix with cold water, two-thirds cup of yeast. When mixed, knead 
fifteen minutes, using as little additional flour as possible. Let it rise 
twelve hours. Cut and work with a knife ten minutes before putting it into 
the pan to bake. 

Bread Griddle Cakes with Water. 

Soak pieces of stale bread in water till quite soft ; drain them through 
a sieve, rub the bread through a colander. To one quart of this add 
three eggs and milk to made a thick batter. Bake on a griddle. 

Soda Griddle Cakes. 

One pint milk, two teaspoons cream tartar, one teaspoon soda, flour to 
mke a thin batter. 

Weights of Bread. 

A quartern loaf should weigh 4 lbs. Sz ozs. 
A half-peck loaf, 8 lbs. 1 1 ozs. 
A peck or stone of flour is 14 lbs. 
A bushel, 56 lbs. 

A sack, 5 bushels, or 280 lbs., or i\ cwt. 
Bakers may be required to weigh the bread they sell, but fancy bread 
is not sold by weight. 

To Discover Alum in Bread. 

Heat a knife and stick it into a loaf. If alum is in it, it will slightly 
coat the knife. 

Alum may also be discovered in bread (if it be present) by dipping a 
slice of the loaf into an infusion of logwood. The logwood will turn a 
purplish carmine if there is alum in it. 

Bread is not good if there are black specks on the upper crust, or if 
the bottom crust grows moist and sodden by standing.

Hominy. — Milk, Cheese, and Butter. 127 



HOMINY. 

Hominy is Indian-corn shelled from the cob, and divested of its skin. 
It is then dried for use. 

There are three sizes of hominy ; the middle size is the best. 

Wash a teacup of hominy in plenty of water, rubbing it between the 
hands ; all that is not good will rise to the top ; drain off the first water, 
then add more ; stir it in this ; let it settle and pour off the water ; then 
put to it a quart of water, cover it and let it stand all night. In the morn- 
ing add to it a teaspoonful of salt, and set the vessel which contains it in 
a kettle of boiling water over the fire : one hour will boil it. The reason 
for putting the vessel in water is, that otherwise the hominy is very liable to 
burn. It may be set in an oven, or over a very gentle heat, without 
danger of burning. When all the water is absorbed, stir it well with 
a spoon, turn it out in a deep dish, leave it and serve for breakfast with 
broiled steak, fried oysters, or chickens. This is extremely palatable 
and wholesome, and much liked though not generally known. Some 
hominy is much sweeter than other. It may be eaten with butter for 
breakfast, or with a sauce of butter, sugar, and nutmeg for dessert, the 
same as rice. 

Coarse hominy requires five or six hours' boiling. Cooked with dried 
beans and pork, it is called succatash.

The substance casein (the curd which forms the cheese) resembles the 
gluten of vegetables, the fibrin of meat, and the albumen of the egg in 
nutritive qualities ; it possesses the same value, weight for weight, as 
food ; but when eaten alone as cheese, is, like eggs, a constipating food. 

When the curd and cream have been taken from the milk, and the 
whey is evaporated to dryness, sugar of milk is obtained ; this sugar 
represents the starch of wheaten bread, while the butter and curd or 
casein represent the fibrin and fat of meat ; consequently milk partakes 
of the nature both of animal and vegetable food. 

The power of retaining the globules of air or steam in moistened flour 
when baking, possessed by the white of egg, belongs, though in a less 
degree, to the curd of milk ; consequently bread is much improved in 
lightness and appearance when it is made with milk.

128 Milk, Cheese, and Butter. 

Milk is full of very minute globules of oil, which may be seen by the 
microscope floating on a transparent liquid. It would take 10,000 of them 
to cover an inch if placed side by side. These globules are transparent 
in themselves, but they cause the opacity of the milk by scattering and 
bending the rays of light which reach them. If milk is left standing the 
greater number of these oil globules rise to the surface and are called 
cream. The milk beneath (which becomes skim milk) is nearly trans- 
parent, and would be quite if all the globules had risen. Churning cream 
breaks these globules (each of which is enclosed in a thin membrane or 
bag) and the oil united into a mass is easily made into butter. The 
Devonshire clotted cream is made by heating the ordinary cream nearly 
to the boiling-point, when the envelopes of the oil globules burst ; the rich 
oily cream after standing some hours is skimmed off. 

The casein or flesh-former in milk is held in solution in it by an alkali 
which is known to have the power of doing this ; an acid, by neutralizing 
the alkali, solidifies the casein into CURD. When milk is drunk, the acid 
of the gastric juice at once renders the casein of the milk solid in the 
stomach ; and milk soured by keeping will, as we all know, curdle. 

An acid thrown into milk produces the same effect, and changes it to 
curd and whey. 

Rennet, by producing acid and rendering the casein insoluble, helps us 
to obtain it for the manufacture of cheese ; the substance next perhaps to 
animal food in nourishing properties. 

The milk of ewes and goats is the richest, possessing as much as nine 
per cent, of casein and ten per cent, of butter. 

Milk is adulterated with water, chalk, and starch, and is sometimes 
sold as pure milk when it is quite skim milk. 

The Lactometer is the instrument used for testing milk, and should 
find a place in every well-furnished house. It is a glass tube, closed at 
one end, and marked with fine divisions on the outside. The milk is left 
for twenty-four hours in the tube, and the depth of the cream which forms 
on it can be ascertained by means of the graduations marked. 

Chalk leaves a white sediment at the bottom of the glass if milk is left 
standing. The milk should be poured off without disturbing this sedi- 
ment, and water should be poured on it, and it should again be allowed to 
settle ; repeat this a second time and a white powder will be left. If it 
effervesces with an acid it is chalk. 

Cream may be kept by putting two or three lumps of sugar into it ; 
boiling it first. It may be kept, if scalded, without sugar. 

To make Curds and Whey. — Into a tumbler of new milk put half a tea- 
spoonful of dissolved citric acid (or squeeze a lemon in). The milk will 
curdle directly, and the whey will be clear and acid. 

We must not, in treating of milk, omit to mention the recent prepa- 
ration of Swiss milk, which has taken so good a place in the nourishment 
of infants brought up by hand. It is a valuable preparation, and if kept 
in the house will often be found of the greatest service for some pressing 
and sudden need ; mixed with water it is equal to and better than any 
bought milk. The Dairymaid brand is the best. It can be bought at 
from Z\d. to u. per tin. Babes who cannot be reared on bought cow's 
milk, will thrive on Swiss milk. 

A simple preventive of milk " turning" in summer is, to put fifteen

In making cheese the milk is first curdled with rennet. The curd is 
then separated from the whey ; in which the milk of sugar remains in a 
liquid form. The curd is carefully pressed and dried. It will be seen 
that both the rich and poor cheeses are without sugar or starch. To 
supply this lack bread is eaten with them, bread being the vegetable food 
containing it. Skim-milk cheese would require butter to be eaten with it 
also, in order that the due proportion of nourishment might be obtained 
from it. When the curd has been obtained by rennet, it is salted to keep 
it from putrefaction, and sometimes coloured with annatto or carrot. 
It is then pressed into a cheese. The cheese is kept in a dry place to 
ripen, as it is called. This process is a kind of fermentation by which 
certain acids are produced. 

The richness of cheese depends on the quantity of cream left in the 
milk used for it. Skim-milk forms the poor and salt cheeses (as Dutch 
cheese, etc.). They contain casein and little else, but are nourishing. 

Stilton cheese is made of milk with cream added to it. 

Cream cheese is made from cream alone. It is eaten fresh. 

The chief makes of cheese are — Stilton, which is very expensive, 
from is. 2d. to Is. 6d. per pound ; Cheddar next in price ; Cheshire, Wilt- 
shire, Derbyshire, Gloucester, and Irish, Scotch, Dutch, and American. 
We may add, as luxuries, Parmesan, Neufchatel, and Gruyere cheeses. 
American and Dutch cheeses are extremely cheap — yd. or 8d. per pound ; 
Gloucester is about the medium of expense. 

Cheese is chosen by taste : the strong and pungent ones are the most 
economical, as less is eaten at a time ; the mild and creamy consume 
rapidly. In large households it is advisable to lay in cheese in the 
autumn ; but in small families and towns it is best to buy it as required. 
One person cannot consume more than half a pound of cheese in a week, 
with meat. If a larger piece of cheese happens to be sent or bought than 
can be eaten at once, the piece to be kept must have a buttered paper tied 
over the cut side, and then be tied up in strong brown paper and kept 
covered over in a very cold and dry place. 

BUTTER. 

Butter is either fresh, potted, or salt. The potted butters are the 
Dorset, Welsh, and Ostend, and are slightly salted. The salt butter is 
coarse looking, but will keep a long time. The mode of making butter 
will be found in the article entitled "The Dairy." Butter has been 
frightfully expensive in London of late years ; the best cannot be bought

under is. per pound. This rate has caused great adulteration in the 
article, of which the most frightful stories are told : the suet or fat of dead 
dogs melted down with oils and chemically prepared, is said to be sent to 
Holland, and from thence imported back as Dutch butter : nay, by a 
chemical preparation, the slimy sewage of the Thames is said to be con- 
vertible into butter. It is wise, therefore, for the housewife to have her 
butter sent up from a dairy she knows, if possible ; if not, she should buy 
it at a first-class shop and give a good price for it. 

Butter should be kept in a terracotta stand ; in hot weather ice is 
required to keep it firm and sweet. Those who are unable to procure ice 
may refrigerate it by placing the bowl which holds it in a basin of salt- 
petre and water ; cover the bowl over, lay on and round it a clean cloth 
with its ends in the saltpetre water, which by capillary attraction will keep 
it wet all over. Stand it in a cool, dark place, for light and heat are 
inseparable. 

To Sweeten Rancid Butter. 

If butter which has become rancid be washed with new milk, and 
afterwards with water, it will become as good as ever. The rancid flavour 
of butter that has been long exposed to the air is due to what the chemists 
call butyric acid, which, being soluble in milk, accounts for that fluid re- 
moving the bad taste of rancid butter. The water with which the butter is 
afterwards rinsed is used to take away any of the superfluous milk which, 
if left on the butter, would become sour. The manner of " washing" butter, 
or any other greasy substance, is to knead it in the cold fluid after the 
fashion of kneading dough. 

Thick sour milk taken from the pan carefully with a skimmer without 
breaking, may be eaten with sugar and nutmeg over it. It is both cooling 
and palatable. 

Buttermilk is used sometimes to make pot-cheese or cottage-cheese. 

To Make Pot Cheese. 

Put buttermilk and thick sour milk together — about one-third butter- 
milk. Put it into a clean vessel over the fire, make it scalding hot ; then 
take the curd from the whey with a skimmer, put it into a muslin or linen 
bag, tie it up, and hang it to drain. After an hour or two take it down, 
moisten it slightly with sweet cream, put a little salt to it, work the salt 
into it and make it into balls the size of a teacup. Press them closely, lay 
on a cloth, and keep in a cool place. Serve for breakfast or luncheon. 
They should be eaten fresh made. 

Cheese Pudding. 

Well beat two eggs, add to them a teacupful of cream, a little salt and 
pepper and two large spoonfuls of best grated cheese. Mix all well 
together and bake in a quick oven. — Or, 

Beat one egg and mix it with two tablespoonfuls of milk, one of bread 
crumbs, and a quarter of a pound of grated cheese. If the cheese be dry, 
add half an ounce of warmed butter to the milk. 

This pudding may be put into a mould, and boiled forty minutes ; or, 
baked with bread crumbs and salamandered.

Beef is the flesh of the ox, and is considered the staple animal food of 
England. Beef contains fibrin, which resembles the ghiten of plants in 
composition and properties. The amount of water in beef is as great as 
it is in the potato or plantain. It does not contain a particle of starch ; 
but its fibrin is three times as great as that in ordinary wheaten bread ; 
therefore, as far as this matter goes, one pound of beef is equal to three of 
wheaten bread. The fat in beef makes up for the lacking starch, as it 
yields a great amount of heat to the system. Fat, in fact, gives more 
heat during its combustion than any other form of food. Fat meat is 
therefore the best to purchase. 

The heavier the meat is the more water it contains, and this has 
to be paid for in the meat : it evaporates in roasting. The juice of 
beef, when extracted, contains a small proportion of a substance called 
Kreatin, which is rich in nitrogen, and lias a certain likeness to the pecu- 
liar principle of tea and coffee (t/ieiue). This substance has an exhila- 
rating effect on the human system, as a species of tonic ; and is the cause 
of beef-tea being so supporting to invalids. 

Beef should be marbled with fat through the red lean, and should 
possess a good amount of separate fat (suet). The animal should have a 
third of its whole dead weight of fat. 

Beef, in cooking, loses on an average 1 lb. in four when boiled ; lib. 3 oz. 
when baked ; 1 lb. 5 oz. when roasted. This is caused by the evaporation 
of the water and the melting of the fat into dripping. 

In boiling there is less waste if the meat be plunged into boiling 
water — not boiled in cold water, when a greater loss will take place, 
by the unconflned juices slowly passing into the water, which thus be- 
comes stock or pot liquor. The reason is, that the heat contracts the 
outer surfaces, and coagulates the albumen in the meat juice ; thus pre- 
venting the escape of the juices into the water. 

Meat contains in a liquid form in its juices, ALBUMEN — the white 
of egg — exactly as it is in an egg before it is boiled. This albumen 
surrounds the fibres ; its use in preparing meat for food is to pre- 
serve the fibres from contracting and hardening. This it does by coagu- 
lating, or thickening, as soon as sufficiently heated, as white of egg 
does, and thus covering and preserving the fibres from hardening under 
the heat. The more albumen there is in meat, therefore, the tenderer it 
is. Now all young animals have more albumen in the juices than old 
ones, therefore their flesh is more tender ; but, in consequence, they give 
less gravy, and from the quantity of coagulated albumen in their meat it 
is white. 

Beef and mutton are brown and juicy, because they have less albumen 
than veal and lamb.

Gelatine is the glutinous matter in the bones of animals ; it exists also 
in a small degree in the flesh. But two ounces of bone contain as much 
gelatine as there is in one pound of meat. Powdered bone can be dis- 
solved completely into gelatine.

Osmazome is the flavouring matter of meat. The flesh of old animals 
has most of it. Under the influence of dry heat osmazome acquires 
higher properties and gives a finer flavour. 

Meat is under-dressed when it has only been sufficiently heated to

coagulate the albumen, but not to coagulate the colouring matter of the 
blood. It is perfectly dressed when it has been heated throughout to a 
temperature sufficient to coagulate the colouring matter of the blood. 

It is too much or over-dressed when the heat has lasted long enough 
to harden the fibre. 

A quick heat in roasting causes the fibres of the meat to contract 
and close up the pores ; it coagulates the albumen (as boiling water will) 
which at once stops up the pores and retains the whole internal juice. 
Then the cooking is carried on by the agency of the natural moisture of 
the flesh. Converted into vapour by heat, a kind of steaming takes 
place within the piece of meat, so that, whether in the oven, on the spit, 
or in the midst of boiling water, it is in reality, when skilfully done, cooked 
by its own steam. 

Meat should therefore be cooked by a quick strong fire, and brought 
near it early, if it is liked with the gravy in it ; slower cooking makes it 
less full of red gravy, but, if well managed, the juices can be retained fully 
as well. 

An ox should be five or six years old before it is killed ; it is then in 
its prime ; the fat should be white (yellow fat is not good), and the suet 
firm and white ; the lean, as we have said before, should be marbled with 
fat — otherwise,in cooking, when the water evaporates there will remain a dry 
tough piece of meat. Heifer beef is paler than ox beef and closer grained, 
the fat whiter, and bones smaller. Bull beef is of a dark purply red 
colour, coarse-grained ; has little fat, and a strong meaty smell.

A rump- or beef-steak should never be hung up after it is cut off for 
use ; the air dries all the juice out of it, and it will grow harder, not 
tenderer. Beating it well with a rolling-pin is the best means to make it 
tender when it is once cut out of the animal, but the flesh from which it 
is cut should hang to grow tender in the whole joint.

Salting of Beef. — Veal, 



Salting of Beef. 

Beef is salted either by having salt rubbed into it, or by being 
immersed in brine. Brine is strong enough for pickling when it will 
support an egg on it. Salt has the effect of contracting the fibres of meat, 
and drawing out the juice from the pores. You will see this by sprinkling 
dry salt on fresh lean meat ; it will draw out the juice which will be con^ 
verted (by being dissolved by it) into fluid brine. As much as one-third 
of the juice of the meat is forced out by the contraction of the fibres when a 
great deal of salt is used ; the salt takes its place. The salt closes the pores 
by contracting the fibres, and thus prevents the entrance of the atmospheric 
air, which decays meat. For this reason, salted meat can be kept longer 
than fresh. But though preserved by salt, meat is robbed by it of much 
of its nutritive quality — the juice drawn out by the 
salt contains albumen, kreatin (the substance already 
described), phosphoric acid and potash. Salt meat 
will not therefore nourish us as fresh meat does, and, 
if long fed upon, injures the health ; and unless 
vegetables or lime-juice are taken with it, will cause 
the terrible complaint called scurvy. 

Fat meat keeps longer 
when salted, if the fat be 
hard.

Veal even when it is the

most deficient of all meats 
in fat. It should be small, 
of a pinky white, and the 
kidney should be well 
covered with fat. The calf 
should not be killed after 
it is eight or ten weeks old, 
or the meat will be coarse. 
Large coarse veal is cheaper 
than the more delicate kind. 
The flesh should be closely 
grained and dry ; if it is 
moist and clammy it is 
approaching decomposition,

mutton often attains this age, but butcher's mutton is rarely as old or 
as good as this. The darker the mutton is the better, it is a sign of a 
mature animal. The fat should be abundant.

Pork should never be bought of cheap butchers or strangers, as thf 
pig is liable to horrible diseases — smallpox, 
trichinae, or little worms, measles, scarlet fever, 
etc. Pork is best purchased from a dairy, the 
owner of which is known to the purchaser. 

The fat should be firm, and the lean white and 
finely grained, the skin or rind thin and smooth. 
If the flesh feels clammy the pork is bad. If 
the fat has kernels in it the pig has been measly. 
Very red flesh signifies scarlet fever. 

Pork is the driest and fattest of meat.

HOW TO CHOOSE MEAT. 

Dr. Letheby gives the following admirable di- 
rections for choosing meat of all kinds. 

" Good meat has the following characteris- 
tics :— 

" 1. It is neither of a pale pink colour, nor of 
a deep purple tint, for the former is a sign of 
disease, and the latter indicates that the animal 
has not been slaughtered, but has died with the 
blood in it, or has suffered from acute fever. 

" 2. It has a marbled appearance from the 
ramifications of little veins of fat among the 
muscles. 




A pig is thus divided : — 

1. Spare rib. 

2. Hand. 

3. Belly. 

4. Fore loin. 

5. Hind loin. 

6. Leg. 

The Chine is the neck 
whole. 



* Bacon suffers less waste than fresh meat in cooking, and goes further as food. 
Good bacon should not lose more than from to to 15 per cent, in cooking. It 



Cooking and Preserving Meat. 



"3. It should be firm and elastic to the touch, and scarcely moisten 
the fingers— bad meat being wet and sodden and flabby, with the fat 
looking like jelly or wet parchment. 

" 4. It should have little or no odour, and the odour should not be 
disagreeable ; diseased meat has a sickly cadaverous smell, and some- 
times a smell of physic. 

"5. It should not shrink or waste much in cooking. 

"6. It should not run to water nor become very wet on standing for a 
day or two, but should on the contrary dry upon the surface. 

" 7. When dried at a temperature of 21 2° or thereabouts, it should not 
lose more than 70 to 74 per cent, of its weight, whereas bad meat will often 
lose as much as 80 per cent." — Dr. Letheby's Lectures on Food, p. 235. 

The parasitic animals which infest butcher's meat are destroyed if the 
meat be thoroughly dressed and raised, during the cooking, to a tempera- 
ture of 212°. 

Roast meat should be frequently basted with its own dripping. Meat 
can scarcely be basted too much. 

Boiled meat if cooked in cold water — i.e., put into cold water and raised 
gradually to boiling point — imparts its juices to the water, and supplies 
both soup and meat. If plunged into boiling water to shut in the juices 
the pot liquor will be worthless. Stewing is very slow boiling. Broiling 
is roasting over the fire instead of in front of it. Frying is boiling in 
boiling fat. 

For every mode of cooking animal food, see Warne's " Model Cookery." 

We subjoin, however, a few words from Dr. Lyon Playfair on the 
science of boiling. 

" In boiling meat for soup, cold water should be used at first, so as to 
extract as much of the nutrient juices as possible, and the heat be raised 
gradually. But if the meat be wanted in a boiled state for itself, and not 
for its soup, then it should be plunged at once into boiling water, and 
kept boiling for a few minutes, so that all the outer albumen may be 
coagulated, in order to imprison the sapid and nutritive juices ; then cold 
water should be added till the temperature is reduced to 160 , at which it 
should be kept till the cooking is completed, because that heat is necessary 
for the coagulation of the colouring matter of the blood. In all cases no 
more heat than is sufficient should be employed in cooking. Thus, in 
making soup, all the fire in the world will not make the water hotter than 
its boiling temperature, at which point it can be retained by a very 
moderate expenditure of fuel. Violent ebullition, such as we see cooks 
often practise, while it does no good, does much harm, not only by wasting 
coal, but also by carrying off in the steam much of the aromatic and vola- 
tile ingredients of the food." 

Meat should be wiped with a dry clean cloth as soon as it comes from 
the butcher's ; fly-blows, if found in it, cut out, and in loins the long pipe 
that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it soon taints ; the kernels 
also should be removed from beef. Never receive bruised joints. 

Meat will keep good for a long time in cold weather, and if frozen 
through may be kept for months. Frozen meat must be thawed before it 

contains a great deal of carbonaceous matter, and should therefore be used with 
eggs, veal, beans, and peas, which are rich in nitrogen,

is cooked by plunging it into cold water, or placing it before the fire 
before setting it down to roast. It will never be dressed through if this 
precaution is not taken, not even when twice cooked. 

Pepper is a preventative of decay in a degree j it is well, therefore, to 
pepper hung joints. 

Powdered charcoal is still more remarkable in its effect. It will not 
only keep the meat over which it is sprinkled good, but it will remove the 
taint from already decayed flesh. 

A piece of charcoal boiled in the water with " high " meat or fowls, will 
render it or them quite sweet. A piece of charcoal, or powdered char- 
coal, should be kept in every larder. Hams, after being smoked, may be 
kept any length of time packed in powdered charcoal. 

Charcoal powder also darkens and improves the flowers of the dahlia, 
rose, etc., etc. 

The taint of meat may also be removed by washing it with pyrolig* 
ncous acid {i.e., vinegar distilled from wood), which like charcoal com- 
bines with the putrescent particles and neutralizes their offensive smell 
and taste. 

Tough meat may be made more tender by soaking it in vinegar and 
water. Three quarts of water mixed with three-quarters of a pint of 
vinegar, will suffice to steep a piece of beef weighing ten pounds. Soak 
it for six or seven hours. 

Most Profitable Joints for Family use. 

The leg of mutton is the most profitable joint, containing most solid 
meat. The neck is an extravagant joint, half the weight consisting of 
bone and fat. The shoulder has also much waste in bone. The breast 
does well for kitchen dinner, nicely stuffed ; it is much cheaper than the 
other joints. 

Sirloins and ribs of beef are very extravagant joints, from the weight 
of bone. The roasting side of the round part of the buttock, and the part 
called "the topside," are the most profitable for family eating. The 
mouse buttock is used for stewing ; shin is used for soup or stewing. 

The usual quantity of butcher's meat consumed in a family is on an 
average three-quarters of a pound a day for each person ; but when the 
family consists of ladies and children, half a pound per day is about the 
quantity consumed one with another, independent of hams, bacon, pou ltry, 
fish and game. 

Lard. 

Lard is the fat of the pig melted down. The best is made from the 
kidney fat melted and poured into bladders. In foreign lard kidney and 
surface fat are mixed and melted down. When pure, lard has scarcely any 
taste or smell : it should be of a pure white, not too opaque, firm but not 
hard. If when it is melted it sputters, it is a sign that water has been added 
to it when prepared. No deposit remains after it has been a second time 
melted. Any opaque bodies which float in it, or sink to the bottom, are adul- 
terations of flour or starch. Chemical tests only will reveal carbonate 
of soda or potash and salt, which are often mixed with it. Lard is 
now sold at \s. per pound. It is use4 for making pie-crusts ancj 
frying, etc.

Dripping is sold in London for yd. or %\d. per pound. In the house

Miscellaneous Receipts. 



To keep Beef. 

If you wish to keep beef two or 
three days in hot weather, do not 
salt it, but dry it well in a clean 
cloth, rub ground pepper plentifully 
over every part of it first, then flour 
it well and hang it in a cool, dry 
place where the air will come to it ; 
be sure always that there is no damp 
place about it ; if you find one, dry 
it with a cloth ; but pepper will se- 
cure it from this. 

To keep Game from Tainting-. 

Game may often be made fit for 
eating when apparently spoiled, by 
nicely cleaning it and washing with 
vinegar and water. 

If you have birds which you fear 
will not keep, pick them and empty 
them, rinse them and rub them over 
with salt outside and in ; have in 
readiness a kettle of boiling water, 
and plunge them in one by one, 
holding them by the legs and draw- 
ing them up and down, so that the 
water may pass through them. Let 
them remain in for five or six 
minutes, then hang them in a cool 
place. When perfectly drained, rub 
them outside and in with black 
pepper. The most delicate birds 
may be preserved in this way. Tho- 
roughly wash them before roasting 
or otherwise cooking them. Pieces 
of charcoal put about meat or birds 
will preserve them from taint, and 
restore what is spoiling. 

Poultry or birds should be drawn 
and wiped dry, and a bit of char- 
coal put into the body and over the

nicely ; or they may be kept in a pot 



lined with zinc, with bits of ice be- 
tween them. Pepper keeps them 
from flies. 

To Pickle Meat in One Day. 

Admiral Ross's Receipt. 

Get a tub nearly full of rain or 
river water, and put two pieces of 
thin wood across it, and set the beef 
on them, distant about an inch from 
the water. Heap as much salt as 
will stand on your beef, and let it 
remain twenty-four hours ; then take 
the meat off and boil it, and you will 
find it as salt as if it had been in 
pickle for six weeks, the water hav- 
ing drawn the salt completely through 
the beef. 

To Preserve large Game of all kinds. 

Well clean the animal inside ; 
drain the blood, and wipe it out 
with a damp cloth. Put it in a 
packing case, and cover the whole 
body with a thick layer of oats well 
pressed down. Fasten it down so 
as to exclude the air, and it will keep 
for three weeks. 

Birds may be preserved for a fort- 
night in the same way. 

Take care to keep out the air, and 
keep the case in a shady place or on 
the north side of a wall. 

Another Mode. 

Partly sink a wine-cask in the 
ground, fasten sticks across the top 
and hang the game down inside it. 
Cover the top of the cask so as to 
quite exclude the outer air. Of 
course the game must be first 
cleaned out and well dried as above.

Cutlets a la Milanaise — an Entree. 
Cut a pound and a half of veal 
into small cutlets, trim them neatly 
and put them into a stew-pan with 
two shallots, a stem of garlic, and a 
quarter of a pound of butter. When 
they have become nicely browned 
draw the pan to the side of the fire, 
and let the cutlets stew slowly for 
half an hour, then take them out of 
the pan and add to the butter and 
gravy a spoonful of tomato sauce. 
Let it simmer until reduced, then 
put in the cutlets, and when they 
have stewed for about a quarter of 
an hour, serve them on about a 
quarter of a pound of maccaroni 
previously stewed. 

Sheeps' Tails Fried. 
Time, 1 hour and 40 minutes. 

Wash six sheeps' tails ; simmer 
them very slowly till tender. Egg, 
bread-crumb, and fry them a nice 
brown. Serve cold for breakfast or 
luncheon, placing them in alternate 
cross bars as in plate. 

Boulettes au foie de Veau. 
Time, 20 minutes. 

Mince two pounds of calf's liver 
very fine with a few slices of ham or 
bacon. Chop some sweet herbs and 
mix with it ; add a little pepper, salt, 
nutmeg, the yolks of two well-beaten 
eggs, and a cupful of cream. Warm 
over a slow fire till the mixture is 
firm. Then take it out and make it 
into balls (well covering your hands 
with flour); brush the balls over 
with white of egg well beaten, roll 
them well in bread crumbs and fry 
them in boiling butter. When they 
are done drain them on a sieve in 
front of the fire, and serve them with 
piquante sauce poured over them. 

Indian Kebobs. 
Cut some apples and onions into 
slices, and some uncooked veal in . ( 



round slices of a little larger size ; 
have ready some small skewers 
(silver if you have them), and put 
on each skewer alternate slices of 
meat, apples, and onions alternately. 
Sprinkle well over them some currie 
powder, and fry them with sufficient 
butter to cover them. Send them to 
table on the skewers. 

Larded Lambs' Sweetbreads. 
Time, half-hour. 

Parboil three or four lambs' sweet- 
breads ; let them get cold, then lard 
them down the middle with strips of 
fat bacon, and on each side with 
strips of lemon-peel, and beyond 
again with strips of pickled cucumber. 
Then stew them gently for twenty 
minutes in a pint of veal gravy 
thickened with a little flour ; add a 
small pinch of Cayenne pepper, a 
squeeze or two of lemon-juice, and 
a little mushroom powder. When 
done pour it round the sweetbreads 
and serve. 

Sheeps 1 Tongues en Papillotes. 

Time, 12 or 15 minutes to fry. 

Wash and scald the tongues, and 
stew them in good stock till tender ; 
drain them on a sieve, then take a 
buttered or oiled paper, line it with 
a seasoning of sweet herbs and 
mushrooms chopped fine and mixed 
with a little piece of butter, pepper, 
and salt. Fry them and serve them 
in the papers garnished with parsley. 

Boiled Marrow Bones. 
Served on a napkin or on toast. 

Saw the bones any size you may 
prefer, cover the ends with a paste 
of flour and water, tie a cloth over 
them and place them in a small 
stewpan with sufficient boiling water 
to cover them. When sufficiently 
boiled, serve them upright on a 
napkin, as in plate.

. Fowls contain less fat than butcher's meat, except the capon, the 
ortolan, and the livers of Strasbourg geese. 

" Poultry and the white meat of rabbits," says Dr. Letheby, " are not 
of themselves very nourishing ; they contain too much nitrogenous matter 
and too little fat. In the case of aquatic birds, as the goose and duck, the 
fat is more abundant, but it contains certain flavouring matters which are 
not easy of digestion. The darker flesh of game is also somewhat in- 
digestible, and requires management in its culinary treatment." 

To Choose Poultry. 

The cock is young when it has a smooth leg and short spur ; when fresh 
the vent is closed and dark. Hens when young have smooth legs, and the 
vent is closed and firm. Black legged fowls are used for roasting only. 

In young geese the feet and bill will be yellow and free from hair ; 
when fresh the feet are pliable. 

Ducks may be selected by the same rule. 

Pigeons when fresh have supple feet and vent firm. If discoloured all 
birds are stale. 

Plovers may be chosen by the same rule. 

The Turkey. 

Turkeys are found in a wild state from Canada to the Isthmus of 
Panama, and far from being improved by being made a domestic fowl, 
they degenerate exceedingly. 

The wild bird is at least three feet high, and weighs from twenty to 
sixty pounds. The most beautiful species are the Ocellated Turkeys. 

The common turkey is a domestic fowl in England. Norfolk turkeys 
are thought the best. 

When young, the turkey has a smooth black leg with a short spur, the 
eyes are bright and full, and the feet are supple when the bird is fresh. 
The absence of these signs indicates age or staleness. The legs of an old 
hen turkey are rough and the vent is close and firm. The cock bird is best 



Game. 

Grouse. — This group of birds contains the grouse proper and par- 
tridge. 

Grouse are in season in August, and are expensive birds. They are 
found chiefly in the North of England and Scotland, amongst the heather 
and morasses. Young grouse are known by a short round spur. 



Rabbits, Hares, etc. *43 



Partridges are natives of the Old World. They are very prolific, 
laying from twelve to twenty eggs. Ants, larvae, and the eggs of insects 
are their chief food. Yellow legs and a dark bill are signs by which a 
young partridge may be known ; a rigid vent shows when they are fresh. 

The native country of the Pheasant is the mountainous districts of 
Asia, but it has been naturalized in England. Our pheasant is sup- 
posed to have been brought from the banks of the river Phasis in the 
ancient Colchis on the Eastern shore of the Black Sea, where it is still 
abundant. Its scientific name is Phasianus Colchicus. The young 
pheasant may be known by a short or round spur ; in old birds it is long 
and pointless. 

Snipes, Quails, and Ortolans may be known as young birds by the 
short or round spurs. 

Ptarmigan are imported in great quantities from Norway, preserved in ice. 

Woodcocks are in season in November. Young birds may be known 
by a round or short spur ; when old the spur is pointed. 

Wild Ducks, Widgeon, and Teal are seasonable and often cheap in 
winter, but Teal are not profitable even then, as they have very little on 
them. 

Quails, Landrails, Plovers, and Larks are delicate food. 

Rabbits and Hares. 

Rabbits are a very useful article of food, and are not dear, varying 
from is. 2d. to is. 6d. each. Ostend rabbits, the skinned animals sold at 
the grocers or porkbutchers, are tame Belgian rabbits kept for their 
skins. When these are sold the bodies are sent to England and sold at 
M. per lb. 

Hares are much valued for food. Hare soup is excellent, and jugged 
hare is'also good. Old hares suffice for both. A hare for roasting should 
be very young ; a leveret is best. The signs of youth in a hare are these : 
the cleft in the lip is narrow, the body stiff, and the claws smooth and 
sharp.r-^Rabbits the same. — To ascertain if a hare is old or young, turn 
the claws sideways ; if they crack it is young. 

The Squirrel. 

The squirrel is a lively graceful little animal, the ornament of forest 
scenery. It builds its nest at the top of the loftiest trees. In it it passes 
great part of the day, but comes out and gambols in the evening. In the 
summer it stores food for the winter. Squirrels are not eaten in England, 
but in America they are considered good food. 

After the squirrels have been split and skinned, they may be broiled, 
fried, or stewed ; they are best broiled. 

The Kangaroo. 

The Kangaroo is an animal peculiar to Australia. It is herbivorous 
and remarkable for the smallness of its fore-feet and the length of its hind 
legs and tail, on which it sits upright as on a tripod. The kangaroo has a 
skin pocket in front of it in which it carries its young, for a period of 
tight months after their birth.

Miscellaneous Receipts. 



Cuisses de Lapins a la Maintenon. 

Bone two rabbit legs, and stew 
them with a tablespoonful of chopped 
mushrooms, same of parsley, and a 
little grated bacon. Let them cool 
when done. Cut and oil some paper 
a little larger than the legs, lay on 
each piece a thin slice of bacon, then 
the leg, then some of the seasoning, 
then another slice of bacon. Fold 
the paper over, and warm them in a 
saute-pan in the oven. Serve on a 
napkin with fried parsley in the 
centre. 

Partridges a la Kusse. 

Cut the partridges into pieces and 
lay the pieces in a stewpan with no 
water, but a little melted bacon fat. 
Put the pan on a brisk fire and give 
it two or three turns. Pour in then 
a large wineglassful of brandy and j 
let them stew for an hour or more ; 
then set the pan by the side of the 
fire to continue slowly stewing for 
about half an hour. Strain the birds 
then from all the fat, lay in the 
washed-out pan some mushrooms 
and truffles, put in the pieces and 
pour over them a good gravy. Warm 
over a moderate fire, thickening the 
gravy with a piece of butter, and add 
the juice of a lemon. Serve hot. 

Indian Spatchcock. 

Prepare a freshly killed fowl ; split 
it in halves through the middle of 
the breast and back ; pepper and 
salt ; rub it once with butter ; grease 
a gridiron : and broil it over a clear 



bright fire. Put a lump of butter in 
a hot dish before the fire ; let it dis- 
solve ; lay the fowl in it or on a round 
of toasted bread, and serve very hot. 

Game Pie. 

Cut some thin slices of venison, 
well pepper and salt them, and lay 
them at the bottom of a very deep 
pie dish (which is put into a wooden 
pie dish when it is finished baking) ; 
cut up two partridges, two pigeons, 
and a hare, and lay them in in pieces ; 
add two mutton kidneys, a teacup- 
ful of pickled mushrooms, forcemeat 
balls, egg balls, and a good gravy- 
made from the bones of the game, 
and some stock. If served hot send 
it up with cover on ; if cold, fill up 
the top with a good aspic jelly. 

Macedoine of Larks. 

Time, a quarter of an hour. 

Pick and clean a dozen and a half 
larks, bone them, and stuff them with 
the livers, a little minced bacon, a 
few sweet herbs chopped very fine, 
and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg ; put them into a dish, pour 
in a little gravy, and bake them in a 
moderate oven for fifteen minutes. 
Boil six or eight mealy potatoes, 
mash them up with a little butter, 
and arrange them in a deep border 
round the edge of a dish ; fill the cen- 
tre with carrots and turnips boiled 
and cut into rings, place the larks 
amongst and on the vegetables and 
three or four on the top ; pour in a 
little gravy, and serve.

FISH. 



Fish is an important article of food. It is more rich in fibrin or 
flesh-forming matter than butcher's meat or birds, but it contains less fat 
and gelatine. Fish frequently contains large quantities of mineral matter, 
principally phosphates of lime, potash and soda.

mon Life," p. 131 : — In 100 parts of

"These numbers, of course, are liable to variation— the herring espe- 
cially, being very much fatter at some seasons, and on some coasts, than 
on others. We see, however, that the salmon is justly considered a rich 
fish, since it contains nearly three times as much fat as the haddock. 
The epicure has also a substantial reason for his attachment to the eel, 
since it contains a considerably greater weight of fat than it does of 
muscular fibre." 

Fish is much more easily digested than flesh, and consequently food is 
required sooner after eating it. The most digestible kinds are the white 
fish, which have least fat, and require to be fried in fat, or eaten with 
melted-butter or sauces. Of all fish, the haddock, whiting, and flounder 
are most digestible. 

The salmon, herring, and eel are dressed in their own oil, and are very 
nutritious. 

Fish should never be eaten out of season, as it is then very likely to 
disagree with the system. The flesh of fish should not have a bluish tinge 
If it has this quality it is inferior.

in great multitudes in the Northern seas, from 
in large shoals every spring. It swims with 
great rapidity, and can leap a height of twelve or fifteen feet. When salmon 
arrive at a spot fit for spawning, they deposit their eggs at the bottom on 
the gravel, and then permit themselves to be carried by the current to the sea, 
where they go to acquire strength, and return again the following spring. 
Young salmon are born in the rivers, but when they are twelve inches long 
they descend to the sea like the older fish. 

This fish is generally caught in nets stretched across the river ; but in 
Scotland they are sometimes speared with a many-pronged weapon, called

a leister. They are also caught with a rod and line. They are caught 
when they ascend the river to spawn ; after spawning, they are very lean, 
and their flesh is of little value. Salmon is, therefore, best in the spring. 
It is a very rich and nourishing fish. It should have a small head, 
very thick shoulders and a small tail. The scales should be very bright, 
the flesh a rich yellowish pink. 

Salmon is sometimes crimped ; this is done by depriving it first of 
sensation by a blow on the head, and then scoring it deeply to the bone. 
Hot and cold boiled it is excellent ; or pickled, curried, marinaded, or 
dried. Usual price early in spring, is. 6d. per lb., is. 6d., later. The 
rivers of Norway, Scotland and Wales, produce the finest salmon ; 
salmon-trout, common trout, smelts and graylings belong to this family, 
and are all excellent fish.

The Turbot, Brill, Sole, Halibut, Plaice, Flounder, Dab and Hake, are 
all of the same family, and are excellent for food. " Their form is very deep, 
but, at the same time, very thin, and they are not constituted to swim as 
other fishes do, with their backs uppermost ; but, lying on one side. They 
reside wholly at the bottom, shuffling along by waving their flattened 
bodies, fringed with the dorsal and anal fins, and as they are somewhat 
sluggish in their movements, they need concealment from their enemies. 
This is afforded them by the side which is uppermost being of a dusky 
brown hue, resembling the mud on which they rest ; and so conscious are 
they where their safety lies, that they do not seek to escape by flight when 
alarmed, but sink to the bottom and lie perfectly motionless." If the eyes 
were placed, as in all other creatures, one on each side of the head, it is 
plain that flat-fish, habitually grovelling, would be deprived of the sight of 
one eye, which being always buried in the mud would be quite useless. 
To meet this difficulty, the skeleton is distorted, taking, near the head, a 
sudden twist to one side, and thus the two eyes are placed on the side 
which is kept uppermost, where both are available. In the plaice, the 
flounder and the sole they are on the right side ; in the turbot and brill on 
the left. " The value of these fish may be estimated from the fact that 
London pays 80,000/. a year to the Dutch for turbot alone." 

Soles keep twenty-four hours well. They cost from is. to gd. per pair. 

Plaice varies from 1 s. to 6d. each. Dabs are valueless, and taste of mud. 

The Turbot should be thick, the under part of the colour of rich cream ; 
eyes bright, body stiff, gills of a fine clear red. It is boiled, and is excel- 
lent, when cold, made into cakes or curried. Soles are fried, boiled and 
filleted ; plaice is best filleted and fried — it is a watery fish when boiled. 
Dabs and flukes are generally boiled. Turbot is very expensive— some- 
times 1/. is. each. Brill, equally good, varies from &r. downwards. 

The Cod fish family, or Ganoids, contains the cod, the haddock, the 
whiting, the hake, the coal-fish, the pollach, the ling :— their flesh is very

valuable for diet, both fresh, salted, or dried. The fishery of the cod is 
the most valuable in the world. The pursuit, the curing, and transport 
affording employment to thousands of people and whole fleets of ships. 
The value of the cod taken by British subjects on the coast of Newfound- 
land alone, is not less than 500,000/. annually — they are caught with a 
hook and line. The cod should have a small head, very thick shoulders, 
and a small tail. 

Cod is best dressed the day after it is caught. It is boiled and served 
with oyster sauce ; the cod, occasionally, has an oyster flavour in its 
flesh. It is excellent " twice laid" — i.e., served up with potatoes and hard 
eggs, or curried, or in fish cakes. Price generally from is. 6d. to lod. 
per lb 

The John Dory is a rare fish, flat, and of smallish size. It is sent to 
London from the coasts of Cornwall and Devon, and is much prized ; it is 
more expensive than turbot. The gurnard and piper come also from the 
western coasts ; they have large and ugly heads defended with spears and 
plates of armour. They should be split and dried for twenty-four hours. 

The Smelt is a small fish, of delicious flavour, resembling the cucumber. 
It is very expensive when first it comes in, and is used sometimes as a 
garnish for larger fish. 

The Haddock is an excellent and delicate fish. It is delicious stuffed 
with veal stuffing and roasted, and delicate boiled ; it is also dried and 
eaten for breakfast— price from is. to 6d. each. The Whiting is a very 
delicate fish, it requires to be cooked at once, as it will not keep. It is 
fried. The Hake is a coarse but nutritious fish, much eaten on the coast 
of Devonshire ; it is generally stuffed and baked ; very cheap ; sold in 
slices. The Ling furnishes the ordinary salt fish.

The mackerel is an excellent fish ; it has a blue back marked with un- 
dulating black stripes and five false fins. It is a migratory fish, and at 
certain periods of the year abounds on the coasts of Europe and America. 
On the western coasts of England the mackerel is captured with nets by 
torchlight ; it is also caught by hook and line. It bites eagerly at anything 
which appears alive, and is "caught by glare"— a bright fish, a piece of 
glittering metal, or a bit of scarlet cloth ; the line is short, but made heavy 
with lead ; a couple of men can catch 1000 a day. The greater the 
speed of the boat, the greater the number of fish taken, therefore a fresh 
wind is called a mackerel breeze. Mackerel fishing is considered delight- 
ful sport. The Tunny of the Mediterranean belongs to this family. Its 
flesh resembles beef. 

Mackerel are boiled with fennel-sauce, broiled or fried ; also soused in 
vinegar for a breakfast-dish. They should never be eaten out of season, 
as they are especially injurious. They are very nourishing fish and cheap. 
Price, generally from 6d. to 3^. each.

The common herring inhabits the northern seas ; shoals of this fish 
arrive every year on the coasts of Europe and America, but they do 
not go farther south than 40 of north latitude. In the months of 
April and May, herrings begin to appear off the Shetland Islands, and 
towards the end of June, and in July, they arrive in vast numbers, extend- 
ing over the face of the sea for leagues, hundreds of feet in thickness. 
The herring fishery is of immense importance ; it employs entire fleets 
of ships. The fish are caught in a net called a gill-net. The herring is an 
excellent fish ; but, probably from its cheapness and its rather strong smell, 
it does not often appear at table. It is bought at id. each. Salted, it is 
greatly relished, and forms an important article of food for the poor. 

The Sardine is a species of herring, celebrated for the delicacy of its 
flesh. It is found in the Baltic, Atlantic, and Mediterranean. During the 
winter it keeps in the depths of the sea, but about June it approaches the 
shore in immense shoals, and is caught with ease in nets. The fishermen 
tempt it into them by throwing into the sea a bait made of cod-fish 
eggs. The sardine fishery is on the coast of France, from the mouth of 
the Loire to the extremity of Brittany. Sardines are preserved in oil and 
eaten as relishes. 

The Pilchard, Sprat, Whitebait and Shad, are all species of herrings. 
Potted pilchards are delicious ; sprats contain an immense quantity of fat. 

The Anchovy is found on the coast of the Mediterranean and the 
western shores of France and Spain. It approaches the coast to spawn, 
and is then taken. 

Anchovies are attracted to the net by furnaces lighted in some of the 
boats ; they surround the boat which contains the light, the net is cast so 
as to surround the shoal, and then the fire is suddenly extinguished. The 
anchovies, startled and alarmed, turn to escape, and are caught in the net. 
The head and intestines of this fish are removed, and it is preserved in salt. 

Anchovy Cutlets. — Cut some bread, about half-an-inch thick, into the 
shape of pretty small cutlets, fry them a nice light-brown, then spread thinly 
upon them some anchovy paste ; have an egg boiled very hard, chop it 
up small, yolk and white, with a little fresh parsley, which pile upon them, 
and serve hot. (See plate). 

Sprats are sometimes preserved like anchovies. 

The Basse is a sea-perch ; it is an excellent fish for food/ 

Mullets are of two kinds, the red and the sea mullet. The red mullet 
is considered a great delicacy. It is celebrated as a fish in favour with the 
ancient Romans, who took pleasure in watching the changes of colour 
which it displays when dying. Extravagant sums were paid by them for 
large mullet, and at entertainments they were brought to table alive, and 
cooked before the eves of the guests. 



Fresh-water Fish. 149 



For very good receipts for cooking mullet, see Warne's " Model Cookery 
Book." The sea mullet is larger than the red, and is striped with yellow. 
The grey mullet is an excellent fish. 

Fresh-water fish are very valuable inland. 

The Perch is an excellent fish. It inhabits rivers, lakes, and running 
streams, and swims at the depth of two or three feet. It feeds on worms, 
insects, and small fish. Its flesh is very agreeable food. It spawns in 
April. 

The Perch is one of the most wholesome of fish. 

" The Carp ," says Isaac Walton, " is the queen of rivers ; a stately, a 
good, and a very subtle fish. It was not at first bred, nor hath been long 
in England, but is now naturalized. It is said they were brought hither 
by one Mr. Mascal, a gentleman that then lived at Plumstead. Doubt- 
less there was a time when there were no carps in England, as may 
seem to be affirmed by Sir Richard Baker, in whose Chronicle you may 
find these verses : — 

Hops and turkeys, carps and beer, 
Came into England all in a year." 

Carp feed on grain and vegetable substances. They have in the back 
part of their mouth a remarkable apparatus for crashing their food. The 
carp delights in tranquil waters. 

It wiil live, like the eel, a long time out of its native element ; and 
is very tenacious of its life, which lasts for many years. At six years 
old it weighs about three pounds. During winter the carp buries it-self in 
the mud, and passes many months without eating. 

We are tempted to add to this notice Isaac Walton's receipt for 
dressing a carp, as a specimen of the cookery of the 17th century : — ■ 

" Take a carp alive if possible ; scour him and rub him clean with 
water and salt, but scale him not ; then open him, and put him with his 
blood and liver, which you must save when you open him, into a small 
pot or kettle ; then take sweet marjoram, thyme, and parsley, of each 
half a handful, a sprig of rosemary, and another of savoury. Bind them 
into two or three small bundles and put them to your carp, with four or 
five whole onions, twenty pickled oysters, and three anchovies. Then 
pour upon your carp as much claret wine as will only cover him, and 
season your claret well with salt, cloves, and mace, and the rind of oranges 
and lemons. That done, cover your pot and set it on a quick fire till it be 
sufficiently boiled ; then take out the carp and lay it with the broth into 
the dish, and pour upon it a quarter of a pound of the best fresh butter 
melted, and beaten with half a dozen spoonfuls of the broth, the yolks of 
two or three eggs, and some of the herbs shred. Garnish -with lemon." 

The Barbel resembles the carp, and is a good fish for the table. 

The Tench inhabits stagnant waters. It is less esteemed as food than 
the carp. It has been called the " physician of fish," having in former 
ages been thought to cure by its touch the other fish in the river or 
pond. 

The Sturgeon is a royal fish. 

Every sturgeon caught in the English rivers belongs to the Queen, ex-

1 5° The Pike.— Conger Eel 

The sturgeon is as large as a shark, but has no teeth. It lives by suction, 
but manages to eat herrings, mackerel, and sometimes salmon, and it 
roots in the mud for worms and mollusks. 

The body of the sturgeon is covered with plates of bone embedded in 
the skin in longitudinal rows. It is a wholesome fish, and very delicious 
as food ; it may be cooked like veal. 

The favourite Russian caviare is made from the eggs of the sturgeon. 
It is chiefly from the swimming bladder of these fishes that Russian 
isinglass is manufactured.

The Pike is the most voracious of fresh-water fish. It devours frogs, 
young ducks, and all the fish which comes in its way. Its presence in a 
pond very soon depopulates it. Pike four or five feet long are not rare in 
the great lakes of Northern Europe. In 1497 a pike was caught at Kaiser- 
lauten, near Mannheim, which was nearly nineteen feet in length, and 
weighed 350 lbs. This monster had a gilt copper ring round its neck 
bearing this inscription : " I was the first fish that was thrown into this 
pond by the hands of Frederick II., October 5th, 1230" — it was conse- 
quently 267 years old ! The pike is excellent stuffed with veal stuffing 
and roasted. These fish are seldom bought in London for the table, but 
are justly prized by the angler. 

Eels. 

Eels inhabit fresh water. By day they lie concealed in the mud or 
in holes which they excavate near the shore. 

When the water of the pond grows low or stagnates, the eels leave 
the bottom and conceal themselves in the herbage of the shore ; they 
will also at night cross the land in search of a fresh dwelling-place, 
crawling on the earth like serpents. When the ponds dry up they bury 
themselves in the sand and remain there till the water returns. The eels 
deposit their eggs in the sea ; in the spring the young eels ascend rivers, 
and dwell in fresh water till they go to deposit their eggs.

The Conger Eel always lives in the sea, or in salt water. It is of 
great size and a very rich fat fish. It abounds at the mouth of the 
Severn. Eels are stewed, fried, and boiled. The conger eel is cooked 
in many various ways. (See " Model Cookery," and " Fish and How to 
Cook them," by Elizabeth Watts.) Eels sell at about 9^/. per pound. 
They average from one and a half to two or three pounds. 

The Lamprey is a species of eel very much esteemed as food. The sea 
lamprey is two or three feet in length, and marbled with brown on a 



Lobster ', Crab, Oyster, etc. 151 

yellowish ground. It inhabits the coasts both of Europe and America ; 
in the spring it ascends rivers to deposit its eggs. The fresh-water lamprey 
is a smaller species — seldom exceeding eighteen inches in length. It 
passes the greater part of the year in fresh-water lakes. Its colour is dark 
olive, yellowish, and silvery beneath. 

The Bream is a flat fish. It frequents still water like the pike, and is 
found in ponds. Its head is very small ; it has no teeth ; the colour 
bluish iron-grey. It is best stuffed and roasted like the pike. 

The Chub frequents deep rivers, and lives chiefly on worms. Its flesh 
is not very good, but it is not bad when stewed in rich gravy. 

The Roach and Dace are not much valued for the table though perfectly 
wholesome. They both haunt swift and gravelly streams. 

The Barbel, named from its beard, frequents deep and rapid rivers. 
Its flesh is tasteless and poor. 

The Gudgeon is a delicious little fish. It is taken in immense numbers 
in the Thames and the rivers of Surrey and Middlesex. 

The Ruffe also abounds in the Thames. It is a variety of the perch. It 
is not much prized, and is sold very cheaply to the poor. 

The Shad is a migratory fish which enters rivers for the purpose of 
spawning. It has much of the richness of the salmon, but is only in 
season for a fortnight just before spawning. After that time it is sold very 
cheaply. 

Fresh-water fish are not always to be found at the fishmongers, but most 
of them may be had if desired. The price varies, and is quite uncertain. 

" All fish," says Dr. Letheby, " are in their best condition at the time 
of the ripening of the milt and roe, for not only are they fatter at that time, 
but when cooked they have a better flavour, and the flesh is solid and 
opaque. On the other hand when they are out of condition the flesh is 
semi-gelatinous and watery." 

The Lobster, Crab, and Oyster. 

" On examining a lobster with a little attention," says Professor 
Jones,* " it will be seen that its head is furnished with four antennae. 

Its eyes are compound like those of an insect, and are 

supported upon a pair of moveable pedicles. There are five pairs of 
jointed limbs placed on each side of the mouth, which are evidently 
adapted to assist in seizing and conveying ifto the mouth the substances 
used as food." (These organs are termed " foot-jaws.") " The pair of 
legs which comes next are developed to a size far surpassing that of the 
other limbs, and are endowed with proportionate strength." Each leg or 
claw ends in a pair of strong pincers, but they differ in their structure 
and uses. One claw is armed with sharp teeth ; the other has the op- 
posed edges of its terminal forceps provided with large blunt tubercles. 
One is used as an anchor ; the other for tearing and dividing the creature's 
prey. Then follow behind the claws four pairs of slender legs, but they 
are not much used for locomotion ; that is chiefly effected by the tail, 
which terminates in a fin formed of broad plates, so arranged that while 
they will close together during the extension of the tail, and thus present 

* "The Animal Creation."

the least possible surface to the water, they are brought out to their full 
expansion by its down-stroke ; and such is the impulse thus given that 
a lobster will dart backwards to a distance of twenty or thirty feet by one 
sweep of this remarkable locomotive instrument." Lobsters are caught 
in wicker baskets called pots. They change their shells every year, 
and during their moulting remain concealed in the deepest recesses of the 
rocks. They are in season when oysters are out of season, in the summer ; 
in winter male lobsters only are in good condition. The hen lobster 
may be known by her coral spawn, which is used for garnishing turbot, 
and for sauce. 

If a lobster is stale the tail hangs limp, while if fresh it is drawn under 
the fish, and if pulled out will spring back again when it is let go. The 
quality of the lobster is judged by its weight ; a light lobster is not a 
good one. Price averages from is. 6d. to 6d. each, according to size and 
abundance. 

Crabs, also, are to be judged by their weight and stiffness. Light and 
limp they are bad. 

Oysters are in season from August to May. They are divided into 
natives and common oysters ; the former being fattened in beds. The 
mid-sea oysters are dredged for, and are large and coarse. Oysters, if 
fresh, will close forcibly on the knife when opened. If the shell gapes the 
least bit the oyster is losing its freshness. 

Oysters Stewed with Wine. 

Receipt 100 years old.. 

Rub over the bottom and sides of a silver or any other chafing dish a 
little butter ; lay some oysters in it, strew over them a little pepper and 
minced parsley ; then put to them half a glass of champagne, cover 
them with slices of butter cut very thin ; strew grated bread over ; 
put a cover over the dish, and set them cooking, with fire over and under, 
until they are a fine brown ; then take off all the fat, wipe the rim of the 
dish, and serve hot. This may be done in an oven instead. 

Oysters au Parmesan. 

Instead of grated bread, as in the foregoing receipt, use grated Par- 
mesan, or English cheese. 

Oyster Etiquette. 

Open two dozen oysters, and put them into a basin ; chop a small bunch 
of parsley very fine, mix with it a little minced lemon peel, half a nutmeg 
grated, the crumb of a French roll grated fine, and one drachm of Cayenne 
pepper, well beat the yolks of three eggs ; dip each oyster separately 
into this, and then roll them in bread crumbs until they are thoroughly 
encased; put a quarter of a pound of butter into a Dutch oven before a 
brisk fire, and when the butter is melted, arrange the oysters on the tray 
of the oven, and keep them turned until they are perfectly brown. When 
baked, serve them up with a plate of bread and butter cut very thin. 

A stick of celery eaten with them adds to the relish.

Boasted Oysters. 

Wash the shells perfectly clean, wipe them dry, and lay them on a 
gridiron the largest side to the fire ; set it over a bright kind of coal. 
When the shells open wide and the oyster looks white they are done. 
Fold a napkin on a large dish, lay the oysters on their shells, taking care 
not to lose the juice. Serve hot. 

Serve cold butter and rolls with oysters. 

Buttered Lobsters— American. 

Boil a lobster, take the meat from the shell and mince or chop it fine ; 
put the coral and green inside, but leave out the " lady." To a wineglass 
of vinegar, or hot water, add a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a 
salt-spoonful of Cayenne, one of made-mustard, and put it with the lobster 
into a stewpan over a gentle fire ; stir it until it is thoroughly heated. 
Cut three heads of nicely washed lettuce, put them at the sides of a salad 
bowl, lay the hot lobster in the middle, garnish with a hard-boiled egg cut 



Lobster Cutlets— excellent. 

Pick the meat from a large hen lobster and two small ones, and pound 
it in a mortar with part of the coral, and a seasoning of pepper and salt, 
a blade of pounded mace, a little nutmeg and Cayenne pepper. Add the 
yolks of two well-beaten eggs, the white of one, and a spoonful of anchovy 
sauce ; mix the above ingredients thoroughly together, and roll it out as 
you would paste with a little flour, nearly two inches thick. Cut it into 
cutlets, brush them over with the yolk of egg, dip them into bread-crumbs, 
and fry them a nice brown in butter. Make a sauce with a cupful of melted 
butter, a spoonful of anchovy, and the remainder of the coral. Pour 
it into the centre of a hot dish, and arrange the lobster cutlets round it, 
as you would cutlets of meat ; place between each the horns of the lobster 
cut into short lengths. 

Shrimps and Prawns. 

There are two kinds of shrimp — the brown and the red. The brown 
keeps near the shore, and is the most highly flavoured. 

The red shrimp is smaller, and of a more delicate flavour. It was 
accidentally discovered in Great Yarmouth Roads by some boatmen 
who were sweeping for lost anchors. The basket of " swill " let down 
between the boats to find the anchor returned full of red shrimps, which 
had not before been known. 

The prawn is a very large shrimp. It is caught in traps and baited nets 
on the coast, and at the mouth of rivers. Shrimps bought alive and boiled 
at home are very superior to those bought ready boiled. This is the case 
also with prawns. They take ten or fifteen minutes to boil in salt and 
water. Amongst boiled purchased shrimps we sometimes see a few flat 
and extended ; this is caused by the shrimp having been dead before it 
was boiled. It will not be good to eat. 



154 Cray -fish, Mussels, etc. — Dried Fish. 



Shrimp Pancakes. 

Boil one pound of the best fluke potatoes ; peel and beat them up in a 
mortar ; then (with a spoon) stir the same up with milk till they become 
a soft paste ; scatter into the latter half a pint of picked shrimps, dredge 
a small quantity of flour into the paste, divide it into portions, and fry 
them separately in a pan with good butter. If eggs are used they will 
improve them. 

Cray-fish, Mussels, etc. 

Cray-fish resemble lobsters, but are not equal to them in flavour. 

Mussels maybe eaten plain. Put a quart of them in a pan, after being 
well washed, with some onions cut in slices, also a little parsley ; put 
them on a sharp fire for ten minutes, when they will all open ; then remove 
the beard and black part, and eat them plain with some of their juice. 
Mussels are sometimes poisonous. They are not very generally eaten. 

Cockles are much liked by some people. They are very good pickled. 

Whelks when small are boiled and eaten like periwinkles. When large 
they can be removed from their shell, and fried as fritters. 

Periwinkles are eaten chiefly by the poor. 

St. James's cockle or scallop is a very good shell fish. It resembles 
lobster in flavour, and is scalloped like oysters in its own shell. 

Scalloped Scallops. 

Take the Scallops out of their shells, cut off their beards and divide 
each into three or four pieces. Fry some bread crumbs with butter, 
pepper and salt, until they are brown. Put in the scallops and fry them 
and the bread crumbs for three minutes, shaking the pan all the time. 
Pack them neatly in their shells, brown the tops, and serve them. 

If the greater shells of the scallop are saved they will supply the place 
of the silver-scallop shell, in which it is usual to send scalloped oysters, 
veal, or chicken to table. 

Dried Fish. 

Salmon, Cod, Herrings, and Haddock are our dried fish. These fish 
are dried by being salted and smoked ; they are also sometimes rubbed 
over with pyroligneous acid, which preserves them at smaller cost. Pre- 
served salmon is called kippered ; preserved cod is called salt fish. It is 
prepared chiefly in Newfoundland, and sent home dry, or in barrels with 
layers of salt. Preserved herrings are called " Red," or " Bloaters." The 
former are very dry and salt, and keep a long time ; the latter have very 
little salt, or smoking, and will not keep long. 

Bloaters are sold at \d. to \\d. each; haddock is dried and salted, 
price from ^d. to 6d. each. 

Choosing Fish. 

For choosing fish we give these rules : — Eyes should be bright ; gills 
a fine clear red ; body stiff ; smell not unpleasant. 

Fish may be preserved well in ice, but it rather spoils their flavour.

The ripe potato is covered with a thin skin of cork through which 
water can scarcely pass. It is this cork skin which enables the potato to 
be kept the winter through. 

It is nearly three hundred years since the potato was introduced into 
this country. This valuable root is now amongst the necessaries of life, 
being seldom absent from the table of either the rich or poor. Let us 
trace back its history and see how its progress and uses have become 
more and more developed as it has added to our daily domestic comforts. 

Sir Walter Raleigh has the undoubted credit of bringing the potato 
into notice, and his name seems as closely associated, in our minds, with 
this plant as it does with the tobacco, which by his instrumentality was 
brought to our knowledge. We are, however, more individually indebted 
to Thomas Herriot, the well-known mathematician, who was one of the 
"adventurers" sent out under the sanction of Queen Elizabeth, who 
granted a patent for " discovering and planting new lands, not possessed 
by Christians," which passed the great seal in 1584. He returned on the 
27th July, two years after, and describes a plant called by the natives 
" Openawk," growing in that part of North America which Raleigh had 
named Virginia. " The roots of this plant," says Herriot, " are round ; 
some as large as a walnut, others much larger ; 'they grow in damp soils, 
many hanging together as if fixed upon ropes. They are good food boiled 
or roasted." 

The potato was grown in Ireland before it came to England ; first, on 
the estate of Sir Walter Raleigh, near Youghal, county Cork, where it 
grew and bore flowers. The gardener gathered the " apples," or " berries," 
and, in showing them to his master, said, "Is this the fine fruit from 
America you so highly praised ?" Sir Walter pretended to be ignorant of 
the matter, and desired him to dig up the weed and throw it away. The 
man, in following his directions, rinding a large number of tubers, saved 
them. 

Sir Robert Southwell, President of the Royal Society, informed the 
Fellows, in 1693, that his grandfather had purchased potatoes from Sir 
Walter Raleigh, and was the first cultivator of them in Ireland. At the 



156 The Potato. 



end of the seventeenth century they were as much used in that country as 
bread. Dean Swift, in alluding to the families and farmers of Ireland, 
says, " They live upon buttermilk and potatoes." 

" Leek to the Welsh, to Dutchmen butter's dear, 
Of Irish swains potato is the cheer." * 

In Scotland the potato was not largely grown till 1728. A labourer, 
named Prentice, living in Stirlingshire, planted a little plot of ground 
from which he partly obtained his livelihood with them. They throve so 
well, and were so productive, that he retired upon a small fortune which 
he had been enabled to make, after having witnessed the success of their 
growth for sixty years. The neighbouring cottagers and farmers seeing 
the great value of the root, the potato became generally cultivated. 

The potato was first planted in England, in Lancashire, owing 
to a shipwreck, when we are informed that it was accidentally thrown 
on our shore at North Moels, a soil well adapted for producing this 
vegetable in great perfection, and where the mode of propagation still 
maintains pre-eminence, and from whence this important plant has 
gradually spread through every portion of Great Britain. But it was not 
for some time generally grown, and was only to be met with in the gardens 
of noblemen as a " curious exotic ;" and in the reign of James I. was con- 
sidered such a delicacy as only to be provided in small quantities at the 
cost of two shillings a pound for the Queen's household. Through the 
succeeding reign and the Commonwealth the potato remained extremely 
scarce, and its culture was not universally extended till more than a 
hundred years after the discovery of Virginia. t 

Ray (1662) scarcely mentions it, and Evelyn does not name the potato 
in his " Sylvia," although specially asked to do so by the Royal Society ; 
but thirty years after, in his " Kalendarium Plantarum" (1664), says, 
" Plant your potato in your worst ground ; take them up in November for 
winter spending ; there will be enough remaining for stock though ever so 
exactly gathered." 

The potato found its way on to the Continent at an earlier period than 
that already mentioned. Peter Cicca, in his Chronicle, printed in 1553, 
tells us that the inhabitants of Quito and its vicinity have, besides maize, 
a tuberous root, which they eat and call " Papas." This, Clusius conjec- 
tures to be. the plant he received from Flanders in 1598, during his resi- 
dence at Vienna, it having been sent to him by the governor of Mons, 
in Hainault, who procured it the year before from the attendants of the 
Pope's legate, under the name of Taratoufli, and learned from them that it 
was then in use in Italy, but no one knew if its origin were Spanish or 



* John Gay. 
f Looking through the average prices of vegetables at Covent Garden Market, 
which was drawn up some fifteen years ago, we find that when the new or forced 
potato first came in they were sold in March, April, and May at the prices respec- 
tively of ten, six, and five shillings a pound. During these three months they are 
considered amongst our greatest vegetable delicacies. The importation of new 
potatoes from Holland now permits the greengrocers at Covent Garden to sell 
them at is. a basket — i.e., about one pound— as early as February.

American. As the Spaniards were at that time sole possessors of South 
America, there can be but little doubt the plant came from the moun- 
tainous parts of Quito into Spain, and from thence to Italy. The Italians 
becoming well acquainted with the potato, gave it the same title as the 
Truffle, being also, in habit, an underground root. 

Some writers assert that potatoes were discovered by Sir Francis 
Drake in the South Seas, and others that Sir John Hawkins introduced 
them into England. It is evidently the sweet potato, or Battata da 
Terra, that is alluded to, and which was used in England as a delicacy 
before the introduction of our potato, and was imported in large quanti- 
ties from Spain and the Canaries. These were supposed to possess in- 
vigorating qualities. Kissing comfits and other confections were made 
from them and from the eringo root. Falstaff says in the " Merry Wives 
of Windsor:"* 

" Let it rain potatoes and hail kissing comfits." 

The potato is in general use in France, Germany, and Holland ; it was 
introduced into Sweden in 1726, but was little cultivated there till aided by 
a Royal edict three years after. It increased rapidly in Russia, and is 
grown in the East and West Indies. 

Attempts have been made to grow the potato in Ceylon ; it thrives only 
in one spot of the interior of the island, from whence the Governor's table 
is supplied. In China the progress of the potato has been very slow ; its 
value does not appear to be appreciated in that country. The colonists of 
Australia, New Zealand, and Queensland cultivate the root largely. 

Gerrard in his valuable and quaint old Herbal (1597) gives the follow- 
ing account of the potato : — " This plant (which is called of some sasa- 
rum Pcnruianum, or skyrrets of Peru) is generally of us called potatus 
or potatoes. It hath long flexible branches trailing upon the ground like 
unto those of pompions, whereon arc set greene three-cornered leaves very 
like those of the wild cucumber. There is not any that have written of 
this plant, have said anything of the flowers ; therefore I refer their 
description unto those that shall hereafter have further knowledge of the 
same. 

" Yet have I had in my garden divers roots that have flourished unto 
the first approach of winter, and have grownc unto a great length of 
branches, but they brought forth no flowers at all ; whether because the 
winter caused them to perish before their time of flowering or that they be 
barren of flowers I am not certain. The roots are many, thick, and 
knobby, like unto the roots of peonies, or rather the white asphodill joined 
together at the top into one head, in the manner of the skyrret, which 
being divided into divers parts and planted, do make a great increase, es- 
pecially if the greatest roots be cut into divers goblets and planted in 
good fertile ground. The potatoes grow in India, Barbarie, Spaine, and 
other hot regions ; of which I planted divers roots (which I bought at the 
Exchanget in London) in my garden, where they flourished until winter, 

* Act v. scene 3.

potatoes may be bought.

at which time they perished and rotted. It flourisheth till the end of 
September ; at the first approach of great frosts the leaves together with 
the stalks do perish. The leaves of potatoes are hot and dry, as may evi- 
dently appear by the taste : the roots are of a temperate qualitie. The 
potato roots are among the Spaniards, Italians, Indians, and many other 
nations ordinarie and common meat ; which, no doubt, are of mighty and 
nourishing parts, and doe strengthen and comfort nature ; whose nutriment 
is as it were a mean between flesh and fruit, but somewhat windie ; yet being 
roasted in the embers they lose much of their windiness, especially being 
eaten sopped in wine. Of these roots may be made conserves no lesse 
toothsome, wholesome, and dainty, than of the flesh of quinces, and like- 
wise those comfortable and delicate meats called in shops, morselli placen- 
titis, and divers other such like. 

" These roots may serve as a ground or foundation whereon the cun- 
ning confectioner or sugar-baker may worke and frame many comfortable 
delicate conserves and restorative sweet-meats. They are used to be eaten 
rosted in the ashes. Some when they be so rosted infuse and sop them 
in wine : and others to give them the greater grace in eating do boile them 
with prunes and so eat them : likewise others dresse them (being first 
rosted) with oile, vinegar, and salt, every man according to his owne taste 
and liking." 

Our old author adds a description of the Virginia potato as follows : — 
" Virginian Potato hath many hollow flexible branches trailing upon the 
ground, three-square, uneven, knotted, or kneed in sundry places at cer- 
taine distances ; from the which knots commeth forth one great leafe made 
of divers leaves, some smaller, others greater, set together upon a fat 
middle rib by couples, of a swart greene colour tending to rednesse ; the 
whole leafe resembling those of the winter-cresses, but much larger ; in 
taste at the first like grasse, but afterwards sharp and nipping the 
tongue. From the bosome of which leaves come forth, long round slender 
foot-stalks, whereon grow very faire and pleasant floures, made of one 
entire whole leafe, which is folded or plaited in such strange sort, that it 
seems to be a floure made of fine sundry small leaves which cannot easily 
be perceived except the same be pulled open. The whole floure is of a 
light purple colour striped downe the middle of every fold or welt with a 
light shew of yellownesse, as if purple and yellow were mixed together. In 
the middle of the floure thrusteth forth a thicke flat pointall, as yellow as 
gold, with a small sharp green pricke or point in the midst thereof. The 
fruit succeeds the floures, round as a ball, of the bignesse of a little 
Bullesse or wilde plumme, green at the first, and blacke when it is ripe, 
wherein is contained small white seed lesse than those of mustard. The 
root is thicke, fat, tuberous, not much differing either in shape, colour, or 
taste from the common potato, saving that the roots hereof are not so 
great nor long ; some of them are as round as a ball, some oval or eggc- 
fashion, some longer and others shorter ; the which knobby roots are 
fastened on to the stalks with an infinite number of threddy strings. It 
growcth naturally in America, where it was first discovered as reported 
Clusius, since which time I have receiued roots hereof from Virginia, 
otherwise called Norembega, which grow and prosper in my garden as in 
their owne native country. The leaves thrust forth of the ground in the 
beginning of May ; the floures bud forth in August ; the fruit is ripe in

September. The temperature and vertues be referred to the common 
potato's being likewise a food, as also a meat for pleasure, equall in good- 
nesse and wholesomnesse to the same, being either rosted in the embers 
or boiled and eaten with oile, vinegar, and pepper, or dressed some other 
way by the hand of a skilfull cooke." 

Lord Bacon writes soon after Gerrard, that " If potato-roots be set in a 
pot filled with earth, and then the pot with earth be set likewise within the 
ground some two or three inches, the rootes will grow greater than ordi- 
nary. The cause may be, for that having earth enough within the pot to 
nourish them, and then being stopped by the bottom of the pot from 
putting strings downward, they must needs grow greater in breadth and 
thicknesse. And it may be that all seed roots, potted and so set in earth, 
will prosper the better." — Professor Bradley in his work on " New Im- 
provements of Planting and Gardening," (1718), says, after describing other 
tuberous plants — " Potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes are roots of less note 
than any I have yet mentioned ; but as they are not without their ad- 
mirers, so I shall not pass by the method of their culture in silence. The 
potato rather loves a sandy than a strong soil : I have seen them do well 
in both, but I have observed that the roots knot much better and are 
sweeter in the sand." 

There have been some prejudices against the potato, on account of its 
being a species of the Solatium, or Nightshade. In Burgundy its use 
was interdicted, as it was deemed a poisonous and mischievous root, and 
among other evils was accused of occasioning leprosy and dysentery. In 
France there was also considerable opposition to the " Pomme de Terre." 
The philosophy of the age was unable to dissipate this until Louis XV. 
wore a bunch of the flowers on a day of festivity in the midst of his court. 
The people then acknowledged its usefulness, and its cultivation as an 
article of food became universal. The value of the potato has been no 
less appreciated by our own Queen, who on one occasion appeared before 
her court adorned with its blossoms. 

The potato undoubtedly is amongst the greatest blessings that the soil 
produces, every part of it being available for use. A bright light, so 
powerful as to enable the bystander to read by it, issues from the common 
potato when in a state of putrefaction ; and Professor Lindley mentions 
that an officer on guard at barracks, near Strasburg, during night, thought 
that the building was on fire ; and, upon examination, found that the vivid 
light which had alarmed him proceeded from a heap of potatoes contained 
in a cellar. The apples, when ripe, foment and yield vinegar ; the stalks 
produce a cottony flax ; also potash ; its tubercles made into pulp are a 
substitute for soap in bleaching. In Sweden sugar is extracted from the 
roots of the potato, which also yield a sweet but not strong spirit, which is 
so plentiful in that country and Norway as not even to be charged for at 
meals. The liquor obtained in making potato-starch will clean silk, 
woollen, and cotton articles without damaging them ; and is also useful in 
cleaning paint. The fecula, or substance, of the potato answers the pur- 
pose of tapioca, and the best souffles are made with it. Hair powder has 
also been prepared from the potato farina, and size also obtained from 
this root, as well as yeast fit for the use of either the baker or brewer. 

Waxy potatoes contain but little nutriment ; when mealy, one thousand 
parts contain two hundred parts of starch (used by the French bakers as

flour, and sold by druggists as arrowroot), forty parts of gluten, twenty parts 
of sugar, and the rest leguminous fibre and some of the alkaline earths. 

Horses will eat potatoes ; they are said to cool the blood, and when 
used raw to be a remedy for swelled legs. For fattening cattle, sheep, 
and pigs, mixed with other food they are very nutritious. Potatoes are a 
valuable article for rearing poultry of all kinds ; they will feed and fatten 
on them with much less grain in half the time than on corn or even meal 
alone. Potatoes boiled and mashed, and mixed with meal, are excellent 
food for dogs. 

The Cultivation of the Potato. 

The mode of propagating this root is very simple, the common method 
being to set the potato itself. This applies more particularly to the early 
kidney varieties, the later sorts and the round potatoes having usually a 
greater abundance of eyes or buds. In cutting potatoes for sets they should 
be divided through the crown, as the shoots which rise up from the bottom 
are strong and vigorous, and produce more stem, which takes from the 
nourishment of the root by depriving it of the sap. One or two eyes in 
each set is sufficient. It is desirable to let the wounds of cut potatoes 
remain for a few days to harden and heal over before planting them. 
Small potatoes are sometimes preferred for setting, the crop producing 
usually about the same quantity of potatoes in either case. 

The early, or forced, potatoes are raised in hot beds or grown in pots in 
manure or tan beds (set about Christmas or January) ; but for our usual out- 
door early crops they are planted in the open ground about the middle of 
February. They are planted in rows two feet apart and about fifteen 
inches distant from each other. The potato should always be planted 
with the crown uppermost (which will make the difference of a fortnight 
in its appearance above ground), and placed four or five inches in the earth, 
leaving the soil loosely round them, at the same time covering them well 
over. When the potatoes are three or four inches high, the spaces between 
should be well hoed to remove weeds and loosen the soil round them, 
which promotes the growth ; when the stems have further advanced to 
about eight inches high, the earth should be hoed up round them to 
exclude the light from the roots (which turns them green); a second 
hoeing is sometimes required to prevent the stems from falling. 

The late crop of potatoes may be planted in March and April. The 
ground is generally prepared for them previously, and holes made with a 
setting stick and the soil trod up over them, whilst the sets may be 
dropped in by women or boys ; the same directions for weeding and 
hoeing being pursued in the field as well as the garden culture. 

Towards the end of July the early sorts will begin to ripen, and should 
be taken up as soon as the stalks have withered down. In October and 
November the general late crops will have arrived at maturity, and should 
be taken up as soon as possible before severe frost sets in, as they arc 
turned watery by it and rendered unfit to eat. Potatoes should always be 
dug up with a three-tyned fork, being the proper instrument for that 
purpose, made blunt and rounded at the ends. 

Let potatoes, as far as possible, be dug in dry and sunny weather, as 
they come up very clean and are ready to house at once ; keep them in a 



The Cultivation of the Potato. 1 6 1 



dry place, and in severe weather cover them well over with a good thick- 
ness of straw. They should from time to time be looked over, and such 
as have any tendency to decay ought to be taken out, as they would soon 
infect the rest. 

Old decayed manure is the best that can be used in the culture of the 
potato ; coal ashes and burnt soil, with a little lime, are beneficial on 
heavy land. On the coast, sea-weed, in addition to other manures (or 
separately) is dug in. The richer the land is the better the crop ; fresh 
land may do without the application of manure at all. Potatoes are con- 
sidered rather an exhausting crop to the soil, and constant planting on 
the same piece of ground requires the aid of artificial means to assist the 
growth of the root. 

The varieties of the potato are very numerous : they consist of two 
kinds, kidney potatoes and round potatoes. These sorts differ in earliness, 
lateness, form, size, colour and quality. Some of these degenerate and 
others improve when removed from one district to another. The new 
plants are obtained from seed. Three years are required to elapse before 
the new root is fully developed in size, and its quality and merits can be 
properly discerned. Few of the early kinds of potatoes produce blossom, 
and to obtain seed from them the plant should be deprived of its tubers, 
and the runners kept above ground by not earthing up. The same sap 
gives existence to both root and apple, so that by depriving the plant of 
one it produces the other. In addition to flowers and roots, some potatoes 
produce stem tubers, which are small bulbs appearing with the leaves. 
These, when set, will yield potatoes ; but very few varieties do this. It is 
seldom that the root changes when produced from the eye ; but Mr. Phillips 
informs us, in his " Companion for the Kitchen Garden,'' that Mr. Bate, 
when he went with the first settlers to Van Diemens Land, took with him 
about half a bushel of potatoes for seed which were all of one kind ; and 
to his great surprise when they were dug up, he had five distinct varieties — 
the White Champion, the Red Round, the Kidney, a small round potato, 
and a variety commonly called the Miller's Thumb. A sample of each 
was afterwards sent into a warmer climate, where, on being planted, they 
all degenerated into one, the original variety." 

Many interesting experiments have been made in the cultivation of the 
potato ; the following and most recent is worthy of insertion, being 
perhaps also the most novel, at the same time highly profitable and simple 
in its application. 

Some few years ago a friend of mine purchased some cuttings from a 
wash-leather mill (or wash-leather waste, as it is called), consisting as it 
does of the trimmings and dust produced in the making of the leathers. 
In a field previously well trenched but not manured, he dibbled the 
potatoes in the ground, placing in each hole a piece of the leather with 
the potato, with a small portion of the dust, filling with soil in the ordi- 
nary way. The potato chosen for this experiment was the common 
" Early Shaw ;" and the result at first sight seems almost incredible. 
Many of the potatoes weighed one and two pounds each, the largest one 
noticed being within an ounce of three pounds. Forty potatoes could 
easily be found from a few roots to fill a bushel measure, the largest 
number of tubers on one stalk being seventy-two, and, despite their im- 
mense size, none were discovered hollow in the middle, nor on being

Disease of the Potato. 

The curl is a well-known disease amongst cultivators of potatoes, and 
is supposed to arise, in many cases, from using over-ripe seed stock, or 
seed that has been improperly kept during the winter and exposed to the 
light and air, instead of having been covered with earth, sand, or straw, 
so as to preserve their juices ; or from the want of lime or salt upon the land, 
and the over-application of strong manures, and successively planting in 
the same ground. All these evils can be remedied. The disease which 
has justly excited so much attention is the same as that which has 
been known in South America from time immemorial, under the name of 
" Casaque" (great coat), which has been shown at annual periods, and 
which took, at one time, the form of a true calamity. Considerable losses 
have been sustained in Germany, where the epidemic caused very great 
ravages. The worst and most general change showed itself first, in 1 843, 
in the United States of America and in Canada, and re-appeared there 
in 1844. 

The following year it came over to Europe, and there increased 
rapidly from the 20th of July till the month of October. It showed itself 
successively in Germany, Belgium, Holland, France, England, and Ire- 
land, in which latter country it increased with great virulence. From 
Westphalia it was propagated to Mecklenburg, Hanover, Denmark, and 
Russia. The disease of the potato appears generally in the months of 
July, August, September, and October ; very few cases are observed in 
June, and scarcely any in May. A mild damp temperature always pro- 
vokes the development and favours the progress of the disease. The 
early potatoes generally escape, when we can cultivate them before the 
time the malady invades us. Towards the time of maturity, this special 
infection strikes the leaves, passes through the stalk, and generally pene- 
trates to the root, where the destruction is either partial or total. The 
external sign is the withering of the leaf ; it presents a yellowish hue, and, 
under the microscope, small drops of moisture are visible upon it ; minute 
brown spots then show themselves, the stalks become yellow, and soon 
after spotted with brown. These changes are observable in a single day. 
We can more easily distinguish the disease by dividing the potato ; when, 
in the section, may be seen numerous spots of a reddish hue, more or less 
distinct towards the centre, scattered or in lines. The malady will be 
made more apparent by cooking in water or steaming the potato which is 
attacked, and when done, all that part not tainted by the red matter will 
break easily between the fingers, whilst that affected, or marbled, will 
resist the pressure and remain solid ; or if a slice of potato is put in water 
and remains there for twelve or fifteen days, the soundest part will be the 
first to decay, whilst that which is affected will remain unchanged. The 
first attributed cause was the inclemency of the weather ; a second, the 
degeneracy of the root ; a third, a fungous insect ; and another, that 
the disease is sown by atmospheric agency. This is the prevailing opinion, 
and that it is a kind of floating blight, which the wind wafts from place to 
place ; this has been observed to be checked when coming in contact 
with a wall or hedge. If a fog or light rain comes on during its flight, it 
instantly settles on the ground arid destroys whatever it comes in contact

with. Learned men have stated that this blight also attacks insects : and 
give for example the silkworm. The tomato and beetroot, as well as 
other plants, are liable to the same disease. 



Miscellaneous Receipts 

To Choose a Potato. 

The finest, mealiest, and most 
nutritious potatoes are always denser 
and heavier than the waxy and 
soft ones. If you put potatoes into 
a solution of salt, the inferior po 



are soft enough to admit of a fork. 
The breaking of the skin is no test 
that the potato is cooked inside ; 
pour off the water, the moisture will 
evaporate and the potatoes will be 
dry and mealy. You may sprinkle a 



tatoes will swim on the surface and j little saltoverthepotatoeswhen done, 



the good will sink to the bottom. 
This trial never fails. Specific weight 
therefore is to be considered in pur- 
chasing them. 

Barm or Yeast made of Potatoes. 

Boil some of the mealy sort, lib. 
for every quart of yeast to be made, 
till they arc quite soft. Skin and 
mash them very smooth, mix as 
much of the water in which they 
were boiled as will reduce them to 
the consistency of common yeast, 
but not thicker. To every pound of 
potatoes add two ounces of coarse 
sugar or treacle, and when lukewarm 
stir in for every pound of potatoes 
two tablespoonfuls of good new beer 
yeast ; keep it stirring and warm for 
twenty-four hours, or till it has done 
fermenting, when it will be fit for use 
(but if older the better). It will keep 
in bottles three months. 

To Boil Potatoes. 

Be careful in the choice of the pota- 
toes that they may be as nearly of the 
same size as possible, so that they may 
all be equally cooked. Wash them, 
but do not pare or cut them unless 
very large; fill a saucepan half full, and 
put as much cold water as will cover 
them about an inch, so' as to allow 
for waste in the boiling, that they 
may be just covered with water when 
finished. Set them on a moderate 
fire till they boil, then set them at 
the side to simmer slowly till they 



or add a little to the water before 
boiling, and afterwards fold a napkin 
to the size of the saucepan's diame- 
ter to keep them hot till wanted. 
Moderate-sized potatoes will be done 
in fifteen or twenty minutes. This 
method of managing potatoes is 
equal to steaming, and they are 
dressed much more quickly. The 
proper way to serve the potatoes is 
in a wooden bowl, covered with a 
cloth. 

New potatoes are insipid till they 
are two inches in diameter ; they are 
cooked in a similar way to the above, 
with the addition of a little mint 
boiled in the water, and served hot, 
with a piece of butter in the dish. 
The best way to clean them is to 
rub off the skin with a coarse piece 
of flannel or scrubbing brush. 

Potato Cheesecakes. 

One pound of mashed potatoes, 
quarter of a pound of currants, 
quarter of a pound of sugar and 
butter, and four eggs, to be well 
mixed together ; bake them in patty 
tins, having first lined them with puff 
paste. 

Collar of Potatoes. 

Beat some potatoes with a little 
mace and cream, or best butter ; 
work it up and shape it like a collar, 
leaving out a little to make into 
round and oval balls; glaze the whole 
with the yolk of an egg, and bake 
them of a fine crisp brown ; place

the collar in the middle, and lay the 
balls round it ; make a sauce of 
half a pint of red wine, some sugar, 
the yolks of two eggs beaten up, with 
a little nutmeg ; stir it gently on the 
fire till it is pretty thick, then pour it 
about the dish. 

Potatoes Fried in Slices. 

Peel large potatoes, slice them 
about a quarter of an inch thick, or 
cut them into shavings as you would 
peel a lemon ; dry them well in a 
clean cloth and fry them in lard or 
dripping. Take care that your fat 
and frying pan are quite clean. Put 
it on a quick fire, and as soon as the 
lard boils and is quite still, put in 
the slices of potato and keep mov- 
ing them until they are crisp, take 
them up and lay them to drain on a 
sieve. Send to table with a very 
little salt sprinkled over them. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

When your potatoes are thorough- 
ly boiled drain them quite dry, pick 
out every speck, etc., and while hot 
rub through a colander into a clean 
stewpan : to a pound of potatoes put 
half an ounce of butter and a table- 
spoonful of milk ; do not make them 
too moist, and mix well together. 

Potatoes Mashed with Cabbage or 
Spinach. 

Moisten cold mashed potatoes 
with a little white sauce ; take cold 
cabbage or spinach and chop either 
one very finely ; moisten them with 
brown gravy. Fill a tin mould with 
layers of potatoes and cabbage, 
cover the top, and put it into a stew- 
pan of boiling water ; let it remain 
long enough to warm the vegetables, 
then turn them out and serve them. 
This is a pretty dish for an entree. 

Potatoes Mashed with Onions. 

Prepare some boiled onions by 
putting them through a sieve, and 



mix them with potatoes. Regulate 
the proportions according to taste. 

Potato Ragout Balls. 

Add to a pound of potatoes 
(cooked) a quarter of a pound of 
grated ham, or some sweet herbs, or 
chopped parsley, an onion or escha- 
lot, salt, pepper, and a grated nut- 
meg and other spice, with the yolk 
of two eggs. Make into balls, and 
fry a light brown, or bake them. 

Potato Pie. 

Peel and slice your potatoes very 
thin into a pie-dish ; between each 
layer of potatoes put a little chopped 
onion (three-quarters of an ounce of 
onion is sufficient for a pound of po- 
tatoes), between each layer sprinkle 
a little pepper and salt, put in a 
little water, and cut about two ounces 
of fresh butter into little bits, and 
lay them on the top, cover it close 
with puff paste. It will take an hour 
and a half to bake it. The yolks of 
four eggs may be added, and when 
baked a tablespoonful of good mush- 
room catsup poured in through a 
funnel. 

Potato Pudding. 

Boil and peel half a pound of po- 
tatoes, and beat them well in a 
mortar with six ounces of butter, 
six eggs (keeping three of the whites 
out), and six ounces of sugar ; season 
with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a glass 
of spirits. Bake and send it hot to 
table. 

Potato Pudding under Meat. 

Boil and skin as many potatoes 
as will fill a dish, beat them and 
mix in some sweet milk, give it a 
boil with a good piece of butter ; 
season with salt, spices, and an 
onion shred small, put it in a dish to 
cook under roast beef or mutton till 
it is a fine brown. Pour oft' the fat 
before it goes on the table. Two 
beat eggs mixed in with the potatoes

Miscellaneous Receipts. 



before they are dished makes the 
pudding rise and eat light. 

Potato Puffs. 

Take cold roast meat, either beef 
or mutton, or veal or ham, clear it 
from the gristle, cut it small, and 
season with either zest, or pepper 
and salt, and cut pickles. Mash 
some boiled potatoes and make them 
into a paste with one or two eggs, 
roll it out with a dust of flour, cut it 
round with a saucer, put some of 
your seasoned meat on one half and 
fold it over like a puff, and fry a 
light brown. 

Potato Cheese Puffs. 

Take some grated cheese, some 
cold mashed potatoes, and a beat-up 
egg, with a little butter, and mix 
well together with a little salt and 
pepper ; put into small patty pans, 
and bake in a quick oven, turn out, 
and send hot to table. 

Potato Salad. 

To one pound of mashed potatoes 
add a quarter of a pound of beet- 
root mashed ; when quite smooth add 
two table-spoonfuls of salad oil, and 
the same of vinegar, and pepper and 
salt ; also herbs, such as onions, 
lemon-thyme, tarragon, etc., chopped 
fine. 

Potato Scones. 

Mash boiled potatoes till they are 
quite smooth, adding a little salt, 
then knead in some flour or barley- 
meal to the thickness required, toast 
on the griddle, pricking with a fork 
to prevent blistering. When eaten 
with fresh or salt butter they are 
equal to crumpets. 

Scalloped Potatoes. 

Beat them fine in a bowl with 
some good cream, butter, a little 



white pepper, and salt ; then put 
them into scallop shells or shapes, 
smooth and score them on the top 
with a knife, lay thin slices of butter 
over them,and brown in an oven or 
before the fire. Three shapes are 
sufficient for a dish. 

Snow Potatoes. 

Pick out the whitest potatoes, put 
them in cold water to boil; when 
they begin to crack, strain, and put 
them in a clean stew-pan before the 
fire till they are quite dry and fall to 
pieces ; rub them through a wire 
sieve on the dish they are to be sent 
up in, and do not disturb them after- 
wards. 

Potato Grafting. 

Take two potatoes of opposite 
natures, nick a wedge-shaped piece 
out of one, cut the other to the shape 
of the indenture and fix them firmly 
one to another with a hair-pin or 
thin piece of wire, care being taken 
to preserve one eye only in each. 

Storing Potatoes. 

Long experience and inquiry justify 
us in recommending that potatoes 
are best preserved if placed in alter- 
nate layers with dry sand in a cold dry 
cellar or outhouse. On similar grounds 
we recommend potatoes to be taken 
up for storing during dry weather 
immediately the leaves have died to 
a considerable extent. Leaving the 
ripe tubers in the soil exposed to 
vicissitudes of temperature and wet, 
is the most effective mode of induc- 
ing disease. — Journal of Horticul- 
ture. 

To Preserve Potatoes till Spring. 

Put a quantity of powdered char- 
coal in the bottom of a potato bin ; 
it will preserve their flavour, and 
prevent the sprouts from shooting 
out so early as they otherwise would.

Our cabbage-plants of all kinds — broccoli, cauliflowers, cabbages, 
Scotch and German greens, Brussels sprouts, kohl rabis, etc. in all their 
varieties — spring from one or more species of Brassica Oleracea which, in 
their wild uncultivated state, have miserable woody and bitter stems and 
leaves, and useless spindle-shaped roots. 

The word cabbage, in its original signification, means a firm head, or 
ball of leaves folded closely over each other ; hence a cabbage-lettuce, a 
cabbage-rose. Cabbages require a soil enriched with animal manure. 
When a cabbage is cut in the garden, the stalk left should have two cuts 
nude across each other so as to divide it into four ; sprouts will again 
Spring from it. 

The cabbage, when decaying, has a peculiarly strong smell of putrid 
meat, from the large quantity of azote it contains ; therefore the water in 
which it has been boiled should not be poured down the sink, but out of 
doors, if possible. 

The cabbage is the most nutritious of vegetables, except the mush- 
room and the dried cauliflower. Its flavour is improved by boiling, but it 
requires to be eaten with fat, in which it is deficient ; therefore fat bacon 
or pork is quite the proper accompaniment of greens. 

A dish in Ireland, known as kolcannon, is the best and most nutri- 
tious mode of eating the cabbage. 

Koleannoii. 

Equal quantities of potatoes and cabbage— peel the potatoes when 
boiled enough ; chop up the cabbage, beat both together well, and put in 
a little pork fat, or dripping, or lard — one ounce to a pound of vegetables ; 
Season with pepper and salt, and an onion or two if you like them. The 
potato's want of gluten is supplied by the cabbage, which is rich in it, and 
a most nourishing dish is thus made. 

Cauliflower. 
In season : June to September. 

The cauliflower, the name of which is supposed to be derived from 
caulis (a stalk), and florens (flowering), is a native of Cyprus, introduced 
in 1694. It requires excessive care in its culture. 

Broccoli is supposed to be a species of the cauliflower ; it is in season 
from November to April. 



J 68 Sourkraut. — Fried Cauliflower. 



Cabbage is eaten by the Dutch, Germans, and Americans as sourkraut. 

We give this receipt (American) for it : — 

Have ready a vinegar or white wine cask. About four inches from th<? 
bottom have a vent-peg ; take a number of the best white cabbages, strip 
off all the outside leaves, and slice the heads transversely, or across, as 
thin as possible, until you have as much as you require, then lay over the 
bottom of the cask vine-twigs, to the height of the peg ; on these put a 
layer of sliced cabbage three inches deep, strew it plentifully with fine 
salt ; use one pound of salt to fifty of the cabbage ; then put another layer 
of cabbage, and salt and cabbage alternately until the cask is two-thirds 
full ; let the last layer be of salt ; put cabbage-leaves all over ; cover them 
with a cloth and a piece of wood which will fit the inside of the cask, and 
place a heavy stone upon it. After four or five days draw out the peg 
and let the brine run off, rinse the cloth, wash the board and stone, add 
more salt over the top, and replace cloth, board, and weight. 

Repeat this operation at intervals of not more than a month, till that 
which flows from the cask is clear and free from smell. Keep the cask in 
a moderate temperature during the whole year. Take it from the cask 
with a wooden spoon or fork. 

To Serve Sourkraut. 

Take out as much sourkraut as you wish from the cask, and soak it for 
at least two hours in cold water, then put it into a colander to drain ; put 
it into a large stewpan or dinner-pot ; put on it a piece of corned pork or 
bacon, and put hot water over nearly to cover it ; cover the pot and set it 
over a moderate fire for an hour or more, until the pork is done ; serve 
with the meat on it ; or cut the bacon or pork in slices, strew pepper over 
them, lay the sourkraut on, put hot water nearly to cover it, cover the pot 
close, and set it over a moderate fire for an hour and a half. Or it may be 
boiled with water, and fried sausages put over it and served ; or the 
sausages may be boiled with it and the skins taken oft' before serving. 

Fried Cauliflower (American). 

Having laid a cauliflower in cold water for an hour, put it into a pot of 
hot water that has been slightly salted (milk and water will be still better), 
and boil it slowly five minutes, or till the stalk is perfectly tender, then 
divide it into small tufts, and spread it on a dish to cool. Prepare a suffi- 
cient quantity of batter, made in the proportion of a table-spoonful of 
flour and two tablespoonfuls of milk to each egg ; beat the eggs very 
light, and stir them into the flour and milk alternately ; a spoonful of flour 
and two spoonfuls of milk at a time. When the cauliflower is cold, have 
ready some fresh butter in a frying-pan over a clear fire. When it has 
come to a boil, and has done bubbling, dip each tuft of cauliflower twice 
into the batter, and fry them a light brown : send them to table hot. 
Broccoli may be fried in this manner.

Lentils are but little used in England as vegetables for the table. 

The French use them for soup, and as a broth with crusts of 
bread. A pint and three quarters of lentils will make a tureenful of 
soup. They are simmered in pot liquor or stock, with carrots, onions, 
and cloves, and when done are strained off. The broth is then again 
made hot and skimmed. Crusts of bread are laid at the bottom of the 
tureen. 

The lentil is well known to readers of Scripture as composing the 
pottage for which Esau sold his birthright. It forms the " Revalenta 
Arabica" well known to us, in the present day, as a nutritious and di- 
gestible food. The lentil contains a great deal of casein, and is very 
nutritious.

The Pea is a native of the south of Europe, and was introduced, it is 
believed, in the reign of Henry VIII. 

Green peas are generally eaten when not more than a quarter ripe. 
They should always be used as soon as possible after they are gathered, 
as they injure more by keeping than any other vegetable does. 

They are rich in flesh-forming matter, lib. containing 30Z. 324 grains 
{see table above) of casein or cheese. Many excellent dishes are made 
with peas — soups, stews, etc. etc. A nice Eastern dish made from peas is 
" Dhal," which will be found a good and nutritious addition to our English 
bill of fare. 

Dhal. 

_ Put one pint of split-peas into one pint of boiling water or pot liquor ; 
boil for five hours, till they are soft and pulpy ; add a dessert-spoonful of 
curry-powder, two small onions cut up and fried, two ounces of butter, and 
a little cayenne, and three cloves chopped fine. It is best to boil the peas 
some hours before they are required, and warm them with the other ingre- 
dients. Serve them with rice, as you do curry. 



*7° Beans. — Succatash. 



Beans. 

In season : Broad-beans — June to August. French — June to August. 
Scarlet-runners — July to September. 

The Bean is said to be a native of Egypt, and is supposed to have 
been brought to England by the Romans. 

The dwarf Kidney-bean is a native of India, and was introduced about 
the time of Gerrard. 

The Scarlet-runner is a native of South America, and was introduced 
into England in 1633, when it was considered a flower, or ornamental 
plant, and was cultivated in the flower-garden only. The kidney-bean and 
scarlet-runner differ from other leguminous vegetables in the pods of all 
kinds being eaten. 

The Americans make an excellent dish called Succatash from the 
bean. As our book is designed for possible emigrants as well as home- 
readers, we give two receipts for making it. 

Take one quart of dried sweet corn to one or two of beans. Put the beans 
to soak in a basin, with water to cover them ; rinse the corn in cold water 
and put them in a basin with water to cover it, let them remain until the 
next day ; within two hours of dinner-time pour the water from the beans, 
pick out any imperfections, and put them with the corn, with the water in 
which it is soaked, into a dinner-pot ; cut a pound of nicely corned pork 
in thin slices, put it to the corn and beans, and put over them hot water, 
rather more than to cover them ; add a very small red pepper or a salt- 
spoonful of cayenne, and cover the pot close ; set it where it will boil very 
gently for an hour and a half, then put it in a deep dish ; add a bit of 
butter to it, and serve. 

The pork may be scored and not cut up, if preferred, and served in a 
separate dish. Dried corn and beans may be soaked and cooked in this 
manner, without the pork ; when taken up, add plenty of sweet butter, 
season with salt and pepper, and serve. Lima beans are the best ; the 
small white kidney-bean next. 

Beans and Indian Corn called Succatash. 

Take the husks and silk from a dozen ears of Indian corn, and with a 
sharp knife cut the kernels from the cob ; scrape gently what remains on 
the cob with a knife blade ; string a quart or more of green beans, and cut 
them in inch lengths or shorter, wash them and put them to the corn ; 
put them with the corn into a stewpan, add half a pint of boiling milk or 
water, cover it close, and let them boil rather gently for three quarters of 
an hour ; then add a teacup of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, and a salt- 
spoonful of pepper ; stir them well together ; cover it for ten minutes ; 
take the beans and corn into a dish, with more or less of the liquid, as may 
be liked. This dish may be made without butter, by substituting half a 
pound of nicely-corned fat pork, washed in cold water, and cut in thin 
slices. No other salt is required. As we have said before, Lima beans 
and sweet corn make the finest succatash. 



The Turnip and Carrot 171 



Preserving French Beans. 

"Procure a large stone jar or a glazed earthenware pan with a lid, such 
as is employed for pickling pork, and put the beans in it as they are 
gathered, avoiding those which are too young, as well as those which are 
too old. They should be gathered when dry, and laid in the pan or jar in 
layers two or three inches in thickness. Over each layer put sufficient 
salt to fill up the space between the pods, and leave them just covered. 
As each layer is put in, it must be pressed down, and a piece of clean 
board that will fit the vessel should be laid over them, and a heavy weight 
put upon it to keep the beans underneath the brine. The board can, of 
course, be easily removed when a fresh layer is added. By this simple 
method I have supplied families throughout the winter with beans scarcely 
inferior in flavour to those just gathered in the summer, but better than those 
grown in a forcing-house. Previous to using, they must be soaked in 
water for two or three hours, and then sliced up with a knife in the ordi- 
nary way." — Gardeners' Magazine, 

Broad Beans Mashed. 

Boil some old broad beans for one hour, mash them through a coarse 
sieve, and mix with them a little butter, pepper, and salt. Put the mash 
into a hot basin or mould, and turn it out before serving. {See plate.)

carrot, Daucus carota, highly cultivated. It is very nutritious. The 
carrot is a native of England. 

Carrots are used with boiled beef or mutton. 

Carrot soup, known as Cressy soup, and carrot pudding are both ex- 
cellent. Carrot jam is so good that we think it worth while to give a 
receipt for it. 

Boil a few carrots quite tender, rub them through a colander, after- 
wards through a sieve, and to I lb. of pulp add I lb. of lump sugar, boil it 
to a jam, and when nearly cold add the juice of two lemons (strained 
from the seeds), and the rinds grated very fine, to that quantity of pulp. 
Choose deep-coloured carrots for this jam.

The Parsnip requires the same culture as the turnip. It is very seldom 
sent to table, except with salt fish on fast days ; but it is really an excel- 
lent vegetable. 

Parsnip fritters make a capital dish. A native English plant. 

The Red Beet 

(In season : all the year through) 

Is a native of the seacoast of the South of Europe, and was introduced in 
1656. It contains a great amount of sugar juice, which has long been 
manufactured into sugar. lib. contains —

Beetroot is ready for the table in September or October. In taking 
them up and in boiling them great care must be taken not to wound the 
outer skin, for if it is scraped and broken all the colouring matter will 
escape, and the root will be of a dull dingy pinkish white, instead of its own 
rich red. 

Asparagus. 

An excellent vegetable, very nourishing and digestible. It is a native 
British plant, and grows wild in many parts of England and Scotland, 



Artichoke. — Rhubarb. — Onion. 1 7 3 

though, of course, the wild plant is wonderfully inferior to the tenderly 
nurtured and expensive garden asparagus. 

Artichoke. 

Also a delicate and nourishing vegetable, a native of Italy, introduced 
in the reign of Henry VIII. 

Sea-kale. 

Sea-kale was discovered and brought into general use about a hundred 
years ago by Dr. Lettsom, a celebrated physician and botanist. He hap- 
pened to find some plants pushing themselves up through the sand on the 
coast near Southampton, and on inquiry found that the country-people 
had long been in the habit of boiling the shoots and eating them. The 
doctor tasted them, and thought them so good that he sent some seed to 
his friend Mr. Curtis, the originator of the Botanical Magazine, who had 
a nursery garden in Lambeth Marsh. Mr. Curtis wrote a book on " Sea 
Kale/' which brought it into notice, and he sold the seed at high prices. 
The fisherman's weed is now a dainty for rich tables. 

Rhubarb. 

The Rhubarb used for making spring tarts and puddings is the foot-stalk 
of the leaf of the rhubarb plant, a native of Asia, introduced in 1 573. Several 
kinds are now grown in England. It is a very useful plant, as it takes the 
flavour of any fruit boiled with it, and thus will help to make jams and 
marmalades cheaply. For example, if mixed with raspberries it will take 
their flavour, or with oranges, it will help diminish the expense oiftulp for 
marmalade. It makes a good marmalade (with almonds and lemon juice) 
itself, (see " Model Cookery,") and is wholesome boiled in milk. 

Leeks. 

In season : Autumnal months. 

The Leek is a native of Switzerland. It is the badge of Wales, and 
worn in honour of St. David on his day. 

Chives 
Are native plants of Britain. 

Shallot, Garlic, and the Onion, 

Onion in season : Yottng— May and June ; stored— August to October. 

A native of the south of Europe, introduced before the time of Henry 
VIII. The Shallot is a native of Palestine ; it has been cultivated in Eng- 
land as long as the leek. It possesses a strong and fetid oil in it called 
oil of garlic, which is much disliked in our country. 

The Onion is remarkably nutritious. The dried onion-root contains from 



Horseradish. — The Lettuce. 



twenty-five to thirty per cent, of gluten. Burnt onions are the best for 
flavouring and colouring made dishes and soups. The onion keeps well. 

It has a strong and unpleasant smell, arising from an oil in it called 
garlic oil (it is still stronger in garlic), which is retained for a long time in 
the breath after swallowing it in onion or garlic. It exudes from the pores 
of the skin in garlic eaters, giving them a strong scent of it, familiar to 
travellers in Spain, Egypt, Malta, etc. The common onion will scent a 
steel knife and convey the taste of the garlic oil also to any substance cut 
by it. 

The onion is used much in cookery by ourselves, and to a certain ex- 
tent raw ; it is the common food of the Portuguese, Spaniards, Arabs, and 
North African people, and being very nutritive takes with them the place 
of the English labourer's cheese with their bread. 

The onion was an object of worship of the ancient Egyptians, and is 
still excellent upon the banks of the Nile. 

The onion is a compound of sulphur and allyle, which exercise a cer- 
tain action on the system favourable to its general comfort. It is thought 
that the onion promotes sleep, and is a good cure, put hot into the ear, for 
earache. 

Horseradish. 

We mention this plant next, because it contains the same peculiar 
principle as the onion — allyle, combined with sulphur and a substance 
called by chemists cyanogen. This substance depriving the garlic oil of 
its horrid smell, leaves a different odour, though still a pungent one. 

Horseradish is used as a condiment, either scraped or in sauce, with 
roast beef or boiled hen pheasant (see Warne's " Model Cookery "). The 
sticks of horseradish, when taken up, can be kept in sand in an outhouse 
or cellar till wanted. 

The Lettuce. 

In season : April to October ; Greek Lettuce — all the year. 

The Lettuce is said to have been introduced into England in 1562, but 
from what country is unknown. Various kinds from Maryland are now 
possessed by us. It possesses in its juice a species of opium. 

If the stem of the lettuce when it is coming into flower be wounded 
with a knife, a milky fluid appears. In the open air it soon grows brown 
and dries ; its smell resembles opium and is narcotic. It has a pungent 
bitter taste, and acts like opium. 

The principal ingredient in it is said to be a substance called Lactucine, 
of which the extract contains about one-fourth of its weight. The juice 
is called Lactucarium. It exists, of course, in all lettuce leaves ; there- 
fore a salad has narcotic and soothing properties. Eaten at night, it 
induces sleep ; by day it calms the nervous system. Lettuce is therefore 
a valuable article of food. 



The Radish. — Spinach. — Herbs. * 7 5 



The Radish. 

In season : Long — April and May ; Turnip — June and July. 

Is a native of China, and was introduced into England before 1584. 
There are numerous varieties ; the long Japan radish is the last. In a 
degree the radish possesses the oil of the horseradish ; this gives it its 
pungent quality, which stimulates the stomach and helps it to digest other 
food. 

Spinach. 

In season : Spring — April to June ; Winter — November to December. 

Spinach is a nice vegetable ; the Flanders kind is the best. It is 
valuable as producing both a summer and a winter crop. Of the winter 
crop only the outer leaves should be gathered, and it will continue to pro- 
duce fresh ones for many months. 

Cresses. 

Both water and land cress are very wholesome, because anti-scorbutic. 
They are not nourishing, but they cool and freshen the blood. Land cress 
possesses the same pungent volatile oil peculiar to the horseradish and 
radish. 

Sorrel. 

An acid leaved root, little used in England, but an excellent anti- 
scorbutic. To stew sorrel, wash it and leave its leaves a little wet ; put it 
with no other water into a stone jar, and let it simmer as slowly as pos- 
sible. When done, add a piece of butter and beat it well. 

Pot Herbs, 

Parsley is a hardy biennial, a native of Sardinia, introduced in 1548. 
It may be gathered for drying in May, June, and July. 

Tarragon is a strong-smelling perennial from Siberia ; introduced 
before 1548. It may be gathered for drying in June, July, and August. 

Fennel is a perennial which when it once grows in a garden can 
scarcely be got out of the soil. Fennel may be gathered for drying in 
May, June, and July. 

Sweet Herbs, 

Thyme and Lemon Thyme are natives of the South of Europe, intro- 
duced before 1548. They will dry for keeping, and should be gathered for 
that purpose about the end of July or August. 

Sage is a much taller plant. It is a native of the South of Europe, 
and was introduced in 1597. It maybe gathered for drying in August 
and September. Sage leaves rubbed on the teeth clean them pleasantly. 

Mint. — There are three kinds of Mint— the common or spearhead, used 
for mint-sauce, boiling with peas, dried, etc. The pepper-mint is only- 
used for distilling, like the penny-royal. They are all British perennials. 
Mint may be gathered for drying in June and July. 



176 Endive. — Gourds. — Pumpkin Soup. 

Marjoram. — There are four kinds : the Pot Marjoram, a native of 
Sicily, introduced in 1759. The Sweet or Knotted Marjoram, a hardy- 
biennial ; a native of Portugal, introduced, about 1573, and sown every 
year from French seed. The Winter Marjoram, a native of Germany, in- 
troduced 1640 ; and the Common Marjoram, a native of Britain. Knotted 
marjoram may be gathered for drying in July. 

Savory. — Winter and Summer Savory are natives of the South of 
Europe, and have been cultivated in Britain since 1650. Summer savory 
may be gathered for drying at the end of July and August. Winter savory 
at the same time. 

Basil is an annual, a native of the East Indies, introduced in 1548. 
All herbs should be gathered in the sunshine, or at least on a very dry 
day. They should be dried immediately by the heat of a stove or Dutch 
oven, the leaves picked off and bottled at once. 

Jerusalem Artichoke. 

The Jerusalem Artichoke is a tuberous-rooted sunflower, a native 
of Brazil. The name " Jerusalem " is only a corruption of the word 
" Girasole," signifying to turn to the sun, as is the habit of the plant. 
Its tubers are dry in September or October. It was introduced in 17 16. 

Endive. 

Endive is a native of China and Japan, introduced in 1548. It is 
blanched by having the leaves tied over the hearts with strands of bast 
mat or twigs. There are two kinds, the broad-leaved or Batavian 
endive, and the Curled, which is the most common. 

Gourds. 

Gourds are all of a very watery nature, and are consequently chiefly 
of use (like fruit) for cooling the system. At the same time, the pumpkin 
has long taken its place as a useful vegetable ; it is good also in pies and 
as a preserve, and is much eaten in America. Here is an American re- 
ceipt for a pumpkin pie : — Cut up a nice cheese pumpkin, take out the 
seeds and stringy inside, pare off the rind, and cut the pumpkin small ; 
then put it into a saucepan with a teacupful of water ; cover the vessel, 
and set it over a gentle fire until the pumpkin is soft enough to mash when 
lightly pressed. Press it through a sieve or colander with a wooden spoon. 
When it is rubbed through, add enough milk to make it into a thin batter, 
and to every quart of this batter put four well-beaten eggs. Add a small 
teacup of sugar and a saltspoon of salt for each quart. Grate in a nutmeg 
and add a teaspoonful of extract of lemon, or some ginger if preferred. Line 
a pie-dish with crust, fill with the mixture ; lay a strip of paste round the 
edge, and bake in a quick oven for three-quarters of an hour. Pumpkin- 
pie may be made in the same way without eggs, but it is less delicate. 

The Vegetable Marrow, the American Butter Squash, and the Mam- 
moth Gourd are excellent for the table either in soup, boiled, or fried. 

Pumpkin Soup. 

Peel the pumpkin and cut it in pieces ; take away the seeds. Boil it 
in boiling water and salt till it will pulp through a strainer. Melt a piece

of butter with a wineglass of milk ; add to it the pulp when passed through 
the strainer, with salt and pepper to taste, and a pinch of flour. Let it 
simmer for fifteen minutes, thicken with the yolk of an egg, and serve. 

Pumpkin with Cheese. 

Peel, slice, and stew a pumpkin ; sprinkle it with salt, fry it in two 
ounces of butter ; grate cheese over it, add a little butter, brown with a 
salamander. 

Cucumber. 

In season : Forced— March to June ; open air — July to September. 
Neither heat-giving nor flesh-forming.

A cool and pleasant vegetable, delightful in hot climates from the 
quantity of water it contains, but considered unwholesome. It is eaten 
with the richest fish— salmon — as a corrective, probably. 

Tomato, or Love Apple. 

A tender annual, a native of South America, introduced before 1596. 
This vegetable is used chiefly for flavouring sauces ; for that purpose 
it is invaluable. It makes 'also an excellent supper dish scalloped, 
fresh tomatoes, bread crumbs, a little butter, pepper and salt being 
all that is required. Put the tomatoes, cut in pieces, into scallop shells, 
cover them with bread crumbs, a slice of butter, pepper and salt. Send 
them up hot. 

Tomatoes make good sauces, vinegar, etc. For receipts for otherwise 
using them, see " Model Cookery." 

The tomato is one of the most wholesome as well as the most universally 
liked of all vegetables. Its healthful qualities do not depend on the mode 
of preparation for the table. It may be eaten thrice a day, cold or hot, 
cooked or raw, alone or with salt and pepper or vinegar, or all together, 
with like advantage, and in the utmost quantity which can be taken 
with an appetite. Its wholesome quality arises from its slight acidity, 
making it as valuable? perhaps, as cherries, berries, currants, and other 
similar fruits. The tomato season ends with the frost. If the vines are 
pulled up before the frost comes, and hung up in a well-ventilated cellar, 
with the tomatoes hanging to them, the " love apple " will continue ripen- 
ing until Christmas. The cellar should not be too dry, nor too warm, nor 
too close. The knowledge of this may be improved to great practical 
advantage for the benefit of many who are invalids, and who are fond of 
the tomato. 

N 



1 7 8 Wild Plants and Berries. 



Tomatoes and Eggs, 

Parboil one pound of tomatoes and pass them through a sieve ; put six 
well-beaten eggs into a frying-pan with an ounce of butter, and fry them 
for one minute ; then add the tomatoes with a little salt and Cayenne 
pepper. Stir the whole together and fry it for about two minutes, and 
serve. 

Chicory, or the Wild Endive. 

The Chicory is one of our native weeds ; it grows in the calcareous or 
sandy soils of England, has a large pale blue flower and a white parsnip- 
like tap root, which grows of good size when the plant is cultivated. This 
root has a bitter juice. It is cultivated in Surrey, Bedfordshire and York- 
shire, and in Germany, Belgium and France. 

The root is dug up before the plant flowers ; it is washed, sliced, dried 
and roasted till it is of a chocolate colour. Two pounds of lard are 
roasted with each cwt. It makes in water a sweetish-bitter beverage, not 
unwholesome. 

The way to detect the unauthorized mixture of chicory with coffee is to 
put the powder in cold water, which (if there is chicory with it) it will 
colour more or less according to the quantity. Pure coffee will not colour 
cold water. 

Chicory makes an excellent winter salad. For this purpose it is taken 
up in October or November, and stacked in cellars with alternate layers 
of sand, so that the crowns of the plants just show along the ridge. If 
the frost be carefully excluded the roots will here soon send forth a profu- 
sion of tender, succulent leaves, which, if kept from the light, will be quite 
blanched. 

WILD PLANTS AND BERRIES. 

Hips. — Made into Jam. — The hip is the large red berry, or seed, of 
the hedge or dog-rose. Gather hips when ripe. Boil them in water till 
they will pulp through a very fine sieve. Take an equal weight of sugar 
to that of fruit, boil the hip pulp with the same quantity of sugar 
thoroughly, as for any other jam. Fill a stone jar three-parts full with 
this jam ; it is liable to ferment and requires space. 

When used mix it well with a wineglass of white wine, and add sugar 
if required. 

This jam is very good. 

Charlock is a common weed in cornfields. It much resembles mus- 
tard ; the young sprouts make excellent greens. 

The Nettle gathered in early spring is excellent. It is a very nutritious 
vegetable. It should be cut before it shows any flowers, for after bloom- 
ing it becomes stringy. It is served on toast like spinach, or pressed into 
a tin mould in the shape of a large leaf. (See plate.) To dress Nettles they 
must be well washed and picked, then put them into a very large saucepan 
with just sufficient water to prevent their burning, sprinkling in a wooden 
spoonful of salt Press them down with a large spoon, and when they are

quite done drain them in a colander, and chop them up very fine. Mix 
them with a piece of butter the size of an egg, and a little pepper, put 
them into a stewpan and make them very hot, press them into a tin, leaf- 
shape. (These shapes can be purchased at any tin-shop.) 

Utility of Nettles. — Steel dipped in the juice of the nettle becomes 
flexible. Lint dipped in nettle juice will stop bleeding of the nose if ap- 
plied to the nostril. 

Its seeds are said to be a remedy for goitre. 

Nettles are very good for young chickens ; plenty should be left within 
their range. 

The Hop. — Constituents : Lupulin — volatile oil— narcotic — aromatic 
resin.— The hop plant was brought into England from the Low Coun- 
tries in_ the reign of Henry VIII., about 1524. It is now extensively 
cultivated in England, Belgium, and the United States. The best Eng- 
lish hops are the Worcestershire and Herefordshire for pale ale ; the 
Sussex and Mid- Kent are the strongest. 

The active principle of the hop is a bitter resinous matter called 
lupulin, and also an essential oil, both of which act on the nervous 
system. They prevent beer from decomposing and turning acid. Hops 
are gathered by the hand in September and October, rapidly dried in a 
kiln, and closely packed in pockets or bags. 

Hops have long been celebrated for their narcotic virtues, and to the 
wakeful invalid a hop pillow has often brought refreshing sleep. The 
effect is produced by the escape of the volatile narcotic ingredient which 
is contained in the oil. 

Hop-tops are a capital vegetable. 

Hop-tops.— The young shoots of hop are excellent served as aspara- 
gus. Break off the young shoots, tie them in bundles, and boil them in a 
little pot liquor for twenty minutes. They are served like asparagus 
with melted butter. (See plate.) 

The Wild Hop may be dressed in the same way and is good, but has 
a slightly bitter flavour. 

BuRDOCH.— The stalks of this wild plant are very good cooked as 
asparagus. 

The Common Arum (lords and ladies) has a tuberous whitish root 
about the size of a nutmeg. Dried and pounded it is sent to London 
from the Isle of Portland (where it is dug up by the country people) as 
Portland sago. Arum root is saponaceous and will clean woollen well ; it 
is also used as a cosmetic ; the " Cypress Powder " used in Paris is made 
from it. 

The Early Purple Orchis.— The tuber of this plant is remarkably 
farinaceous and nutritive. An ounce of it dried, mixed with an ounce of 
soup stock, is said to be sufficient for the day's food of a working man. 
Put into milk it will prevent it from turning sour. 

The tuber is prepared for use by washing, brushing off the brown skin, 
and roasting it on a tin plate in an oven from six to ten minutes. It is 
then placed to dry gradually in moderate heat. 

Borage.— All parts of this plant contain much mucilage. The stem 
and leaves contain nitrate of potassia and other saline qualities. It is 
very cooling, and a tonic. It is a wild plant with a beautiful blue 
flower. It is used in making " cups " of different kinds. Nothing can

took prettier than the borage with its lovely blue flowers lying on the top 
of a cider cup. It grows in gardens to a good height. 

Sea Holly or eringo root is found on the sea shore. It is prickly, has 
dry horny leaves, and is of a bluish hue. The Swedes eat the young 
shoots as' asparagus. Candied, it is sold at chemists' shops, and is very 
strengthening. 

Dandelion. — This weed is used for making Taraxacum coffee, and is 
excellent as a remedy for bilious attacks. Blanched dandelion roots make 
a pleasant addition to a salad ; they are blanched like other plants by 
covering them from the light with earth or sand. 

A Mode of Use — Take three pounds of best coffee, one pound of hard 
extract of dandelion and succory reduced to coarse powder and ground. 

Wild Spinach. — The roots may be eaten in spring like asparagus. 
" Good King Henry," as it is often called, is eaten also as spinach. 

Watercress. — A cooling vegetable eaten at breakfast or tea ; it 
should grow in very pure running water ; and in the spring be carefully 
examined, to see that no spawn of toads, etc., is clinging to the leaves. 

Some Ferns are eatable (especially the common brake) ; they should 
be boiled when they are quite young, covered with down, and the fronds 
bent and rolled up in themselves ; they form a delicious kind of aspara- 
gus. {See Galton's Works.) In Siberia the fern is used in brewing ale. 
— One third of the fern root to two-thirds of malt. — Dr. Clarke says, "the 
properties of ferns are tonic, antibilious, and decidedly deobstruent ; and 
therefore a fern, if esculent, might be expected to be very serviceable as 
a change of diet, to those labouring under dyspepsia and its conse- 
quences." 

For eating, the young fronds of the fern must be blanched. 

n The young fronds," continues Dr. Clarke, " should be cut as soon 
as they first appear at the surface of the ground, and as low down as 
may be ; and when quite blanched, boiled for one hour, but if tinged 
with green, for an hour and a quarter, or an hour and a half, the leafy 
part in the latter instance being rejected, and a sufficient quantity of salt 
added to give the vegetable a slightly saline flavour." 

Soap-wort. — The leaves and flowers of this plant are saponaceous ; 
they contain a large quantity of alkali. They may be boiled, and clothes 
washed in the water will not require soap. 



THE COMMON MUSHEOOM. 

Agaricus campestris (True Meadow Mushroom). 

The common meadow mushroom varies considerably, but " common 
to all are a fleshy pi lens, which is sometimes smooth, sometimes scaly, in 
colour white, or of different shades of tawny, fuliginous, or brown ; gills 
free, at first pallid, then flesh-coloured, then pink, next purple, at length 
tawny-black ; the stem white, full, firm, varying in shape, furnished with 
a white persistent ring ; the spores brown-black, and a volva which is very 
fugacious." — Badhanis Esculent Funguses of England. 

There is scarcely any one in England who does not feel himself com- 
petent to decide on the genuineness of a mushroom ; its pink gills

easily distinguish it from a kindred fungus, Ag. arvensis, the gills of which 
are of a flesh-coloured grey, and out of the pickings of ten thousand hands 
a mistake is of rare occurrence ; and yet no fungus presents itself under 
such a variety of forms, or such singular diversities of aspect. The infer- 
ence is plain ; less discrimination than that employed to distinguish this 
would enable anyone who should take the trouble to recognise at a glance 
many of those esculent species, which every spring and autumn fill our 
plantations and pastures with plenteousness. Neither is this left to be a 
mere matter of inference ; it is corroborated in a singular manner by what 
takes place at Rome ; there, whilst many hundred baskets of what we call 
toadstools are carried home for the table, almost the only one condemned 
to be thrown into the Tiber, by the inspector of the fungus market, is our 
own mushroom ; indeed, in such dread is this held in the Papal States, 
that no one knowingly would touch it. " It is reckoned one of the fiercest

imprecations," writes Professor Sanguinetti, " amongst our lower orders, 
infamous for the horrible nature of their oaths, to pray that one may die 
of a Pratioloj " and although it has been some years registered among the 
esculent funguses of Milan and Pavia (on the authority of Vittadini), it 
has not yet found its way into those markets. Mr. Worthington G. Smith, 
in his "Mushrooms and Toad-stools," qualifies this statement of Dr. 
Badham. 

Agaricus campesiris is not generally appreciated in Italy, and indeed 



1 82 The Common Mushroom. 

is seldom eaten, and never appears in the markets, for the simple reason 
that there would be no sale for it. There is an edict in existence ordering 
certain fungi to be thrown into the Tiber, but it is now and has long been 
altogether effete ; and whilst there is an abundance of A. Ccesareus 
(avowedly the most delicious of all fungi) for the markets of Italy, it is not 
to be expected the consumption will be given up for another and little 
known species. 

The Modes of Cooking this Species. — " The mushroom, having the same 
proximate principles as meat, requires like meat to be cooked before these 
become changed. The Ag. campestris may be prepared in a great variety 
of ways : they give a fine flavour to soup, and greatly improve beef-tea ; 
where arrowroot and weak broths are distasteful to the patient, the simple 
seasoning of a little ketchup will frequently form an agreeable change. 
Some roast them, basting with melted butter and white (French) wine 
sauce. In patties and vols-au-vent they are equally excellent ; in fricas- 
sees, as everybody knows, they are the important element of the dish. 

Mushrooms a la Creme. — Trim and rub half a pint of button mush- 
rooms, dissolve two ounces of butter rolled in flour in a stewpan ; then 
put in the mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, a teaspoonful of salt, half a tea- 
spoonful each of white pepper and of powdered sugar, shake the pan 
round for ten minutes, then beat up the yolks of two eggs, with two table- 
spoonfuls of cream, and add by degrees to the mushrooms ; in two or 
three minutes you can serve them in the sauce. 

MusJirooms on Toast. — Put a pint of mushrooms into a stewpan, with 
two ounces of butter rolled in flour ; add a teaspoonful of salt, half a tea- 
spoonful of white pepper, a blade of mace powdered, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of grated lemon ; stew till the butter is all absorbed, then add as much 
white roux as will moisten the mushrooms ; fry a slice of bread in butter, 
to fit the dish, and as soon as the mushrooms are tender serve them on 
the toast. 

To Pot Mushrooms. — The small open mushrooms suit best for potting. 
Trim and rub them ; put into a stewpan a quart of mushrooms, three ounces 
of butter, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and half a teaspoonful of Cayenne and 
mace mixed, and stew for ten or fifteen minutes, or till the mushrooms are 
tender; take them carefully out and drain them perfectly on a sloping dish, 
and when cold press them into small pots, and pour clarified butter over 
them, in which state they will keep for a week or two. If required to be 
longer preserved, put writing paper and melted suet over the butter. 



THE TRUFFLE. 



The Truffle {Tuber cibariuni) grows under ground, a few inches be- 
neath the surface. Truffles are not common in England, though occa- 
sionally found. They are imported chiefly from Perigord, and they are 
also abundant in Piedmont. They like dry, light soils, and are found at 
the roots of oak and chestnut trees. Dogs are taught to find them bv 
scent, and show where they are by scratching the ground : or even will 



The Truffle. 



1S3 



dig them up. They are collected between October and January. When 
they are quite mature they become gelatinous, and gradually dissolve 
away. 




Truffle Dog. 

The truffle is about the size of a hen's egg, and has no roots or fibrils ; 
the skin is blackish or dark grey, with small projections like warts on it. 
The flesh is greyish white or blackish with black or brown veins. They 
are very expensive to purchase. 

They are much used for flavourings. 

Truffles are found in England in Hampshire, Wilts, and Kent. They 
are in season all the winter, from November to March. 

Truffles. 

Time, 1 hour or more. 

Clean the truffles well by washing them in several waters and re- 
moving the earth with a brush till they are quite free from it ; butter some 
pieces of white writing-paper and wrap each truffle in it. Bake them in a 
hot oven for an hour at least. When they are done remove the papers, 
wipe the truffles, and serve them in a hot napkin. Or, 

They may be cut in slices, seasoned with pepper, salt, garlic, and 
pounded mace, and baked for about an hour in a quarter of a pint of the 
best salad oil. When they are done squeeze a lemon over them. 



1 84 To preserve Vegetables for Winter use. 



To Boil Fresh Truffles. 

Take twelve large truffles, pare the outside skins off very thin, wash 
them, and put them into a stewpan that will just hold them, and cover 
them with half white wine, half water, two or three cloves, a little salt, and 
a quarter of a blade of mace. Cover them close, and boil them gently for 
an hour, then fold a napkin, lay it in a dish, and serve the truffles on it. 

Fresh Truffles Stewed. 

Pare off the outside from six or eight large green truffles, cut them in 
thin slices, and put them into a stewpan with half a pint of gravy, a glass 
of white wine, sweet herbs tied together, pepper, salt, and mace. Cover 
them close, and let them simmer very slowly for one hour, then add a 
piece of butter mixed with flour. Stew it until thick, and squeeze in the 
juice of half a lemon, crisp the top of a French roll, put it in the centre of 
a dish, take out the bunch of sweet herbs, and put the truffles over the 
roll. 

TO PRESERVE VEGETABLE S FOR WINTER USE. 

Green stringed beans must be picked when young ; put a layer three 
inches deep in a small wooden keg, or half-barrel, sprinkle in salt an inch 
deep, then put another layer of beans, then salt, and beans and salt in 
alternate layers until you have enough ; let the last be salt ; cover them 
with a piece of board which will fit the inside of the barrel or keg, and 
place a heavy weight upon it. They will make a brine. 

When wanted for use, soak them one night or more in plenty of water, 
changing it once or twice until the salt is out of them, then cut them and 
boil the same as when fresh. 

Carrots, beans, beetroots, parsnips, and potatoes keep best in dry 
sand, or earth, in a cellar ; turnips keep best on a dry cellar bottom, or 
they may be kept the same as carrots, etc. Whatever earth remains 
about them when taken from the ground should not be taken off. 

When sprouts come on potatoes or other stored vegetables, they should 
be carefully cut off. 

The young sprouts from turnips are sometimes served as a salad, or 
boiled tender in salt and water and served with butter and pepper over. 

Celery may be kept all the winter by setting it in boxes filled with 
earth ; kept in the cellar, it will grow and whiten in the dark. Leeks 
may be kept also in this way. 

Cabbages set out in earth, in a good cellar, will keep good and fresh all 
the winter. Small close heads of cabbage may be kept many weeks by 
taking them before the frost comes and laying them on a stone floor ; this 
will whiten them and make them tender. 

Store onions are to be strung and hung in a cold, dry place. 

Pumpkin may be kept for use thus : — Cut it up, take off the skin, and 
take out the seeds ; put a teacup of water to a common-sized pumpkin and 
stew it to a mash over a slow fire ; let it dry as much as it will without 
burning ; then take it up, spread it in pans or make it into thin cakes, and 
dry it in a hot sun or cool oven after baking 



Seaweeds. 185 



it in milk or pour hot milk over it, and let it dissolve : then add eggs for 
pies. Pumpkins may be kept for a long time on frames in a good dry 
cellar, or they may be cut up and dried the same as apples ; they are then 
to be stewed with very little water, and used the same as fresh pumpkin. 

Parsley should be cut when tender and a delicate green ; then pack it 
down in sweet butter ; one pound of butter will be enough for a quarter of 
a peck of parsley. This butter may be used for melted butter, or sauce, or 
for frying, or for fricassee. In this way parsley may be kept perfectly 
green and fresh all the winter. 

Green vegetables are good in proportion as they are young and fresh 
gathered. Spinach, cucumbers, new potatoes, beets, and turnips should be 
put in cold water sometime before dressing. 

SEAWEEDS. 
Marine Algae. 

The seaweeds on our coasts are comparatively nutritious food. In a 
moderately dry condition they are said to contain from 18 to 26 per cent, 
of water, 9-0 to 1 5 per cent, of nitrogenous constituents, and about 66 per 
cent, of starchy matter and sugar. They are consequently shown to be 
richer in nitrogen than oatmeal or Indian corn. 

The edible s^weeds are, Ulva latiforina, Porphyra laciniata, Condrus 
crispus, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, and Alaria esculenta. 

Ulva Latissima 

Is a deep green weed, covering the stones as well as the rocks as the 
tide recedes, called by fishermen " oyster green," because employed to 
cover oysters. It is also called lave?; as it is used by epicures instead of 
the true laver, when Porphyra cannot be procured, but it is by no means 
so good. 

Porphyra. 

(From a Greek word signifying " Furple.") 

Generic character. — Delicately membranaceous, flat, purple. 

Porphyra is also called Laver and Sloke. It is a favourite dish with 
some people, stewed for several hours until quite tender, and eaten with 
pepper, vinegar, and butter ; others prefer it cooked with leeks and onions, or 
pickled and eaten with oil and lemon-juice. It does not look inviting and 
the taste is peculiar, but is very wholesome, and will keep a long time in 
closed tin vessels ; it is therefore valuable in long sea voyages. 

Chondrus. 

(Name signifying " Cartilage," from the toughness of its frond.) 

Generic character. — A flat, cartilaginous frond, divided into branching 
lesser fronds of purplish or livid red colour. 

Fructification. — 1. Tubercles, or warts, composed of radiating threads, 
whose lower joints transfoim into spores. 2. Tetraspores collected into 
sori, immersed in the substance of the frond. 



:86 Seaweeds. 



Chondrus Crispus. 

In deep pools between half-tide and low water we shall find abun- 
dance of this seaweed, better known as Irish moss, or Carrageen moss, 
sold once as high as is. 6d. per pound, whilst in repute with physicians as 
a light and easily-digested food for invalids. This plant varies exceed- 
ingly in size and colour : in shallow pools, small, pale, and stunted ; 
whilst in the shadow of a great rock, or down at the bottom of a deep 
pool, it has purple red and reddish-green thick fronds in dense masses. 
Carrageen Moss has been recently prepared and sold for making a cheap 
and nourishing blancmange. 

Laminaria Digitata, 

Called Sea-girdles, in England ; Tangle, in Scotland ; Sea-staff, Sea- 
wand, Coius'-tails, and Red-ware in the Orkneys. These great thick 
stems are cut up by the fisher-boys as handles for knives or hooks. When 
it is fresh the blade is stuck in, and as the stem dries it hardens, contracts 
closely and firmly, embracing the hilt of the blade. It takes some months 
to be quite firm, and then is hard and shrivelled, very like hart's-horn.* 

" Look reverently at it," says Mrs. Lane Clarke, in her charming " Com- 
mon Seaweeds." " Do you know that a little slice under the microscope 
will show you a tissue of delicate cells in which God has stored up one of 
the most precious remedies for suffering mankind ? that He has given the 
Laminaria-stem power to abstract from the sea a precious substance 
called Iodine — that which alone can relieve the pale, sad sufferer from 
scrofula, reduce the swollen glands, check the ravages of cancer, act on 
the torpid liver, ease the racking pains of rheumatism, give the flush of 
health to the wasted weary invalid ? Yes — this is hidden in that rough 
brown stem, brought out by fire in the kelp-kilns of Ireland and Scotland. 
Another use is its importance in the manufacture of glass : our fragile 
beautiful glass springs from the old brown seaweed. 

" Some shipwrecked sailors, making a fire with the dried weed amidst 
fine river sand, found the strange transparent substance in the ashes 
which gave the first hint of our window panes. What should we have 
done for soap without those sticks of tangle ? And do we remember that 
iodine, like the violet mist of the Arabian tales, rises from the burning 
kelp — a genie whose power gives back the lost, the absent, the beloved ? 
Did not the calotype, the daguerreotype, owe their birth to this subtile 
essence, compelling the sun itself to be a portrait painter ? 

" Well may those banners float out upon the sea, and well may we 
ponder on the tangled fronds cast up by the storm. There is subject for 
a long lesson and for a song of praise in the weather-beaten stems of old 
Laminaria Digitata." 

Laminaria Saccharina. 

A single, smooth, brown frond, clear olive and glossy, with a conical 
root of twisted fibres. It well deserves its name " Saccharine," from the 



"Common Seaweeds." By Mrs. Lane Clarke. 



Fresh Fruits. 187 



abundance of sweet mannite or manna which is secreted in its cells. This 
was discovered by Dr. Stenhouse some years ago : he took a quantity of 
this seaweed and macerated it in a particular way called "digesting" in 
hot water, which formed it into a brownish sweetish mucilage. When 
evaporated, it left a considerable quantity of saline semi-crystalline sub- 
stance. This was reduced to powder and treated with alcohol, by which 
a considerable portion of it was dissolved. This solution yielded, on 
cooling, large hard prisms of fine silky lustre, very beautiful, purely white 
as loaf sugar and almost as sweet. This is mannite. 

Alaria Eseulenta. 

(Name from ala, "a wing," in allusion to the winged leaflets at the 
base of the frond. ) 

This beautiful plant is abundant on the northern coasts of England 
and Scotland, and extends throughout the whole of the Northern and 
Pacific Oceans. It flourishes in the deepest water and on the most ex- 
posed rocks ; the roughest sea seems to be its chosen playfellow, though 
the delicate fronds are worn and torn by the rude waves, and we rarely 
find a specimen in a perfect state. The colour is clear olive yellow ; the 
root is a mass of round strong branching fibres, the stem as thick as a 
small goose-quill, naked in its lower part for the length of two to four 
inches, then clothed with leaflets without a rib, four inches long, after 
which the frond begins, and varies from three to twenty feet in length, the 
margin plaited and split here and there like a frond of hart's-tongue fern. 
The fructification is microscopic, formed on the leaflets, which appear, 
when in fruit, as if partially covered with a brown crust. This crust con- 
sists of dense masses of slender transparent spore-cases, on a stalk con- 
taining four spores set in a cruciform manner. 

The plant is eaten in Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, and the Faroe 
Islands, and has various household names — " Badderlocks," " Henware," 
" Honeyware," and " Murlins." Four other species are natives of America 
and of Asia. 

To prepare seedweeds for food they must first be steeped in water, to 
which add a little carbonate of soda ; this will remove saline particles and 
take off their bitterness. Then stew them in water and milk till they are 
tender. Serve them flavoured with pepper and vinegar. 



FRESH FRUITS. 

All fresh fruits contain a mixture of vegetable acids, with more or less 
sugar and mucilage. They are mostly cooling, refreshing, and whole- 
some, but to this stone fruits are in many cases an exception. Peaches, 
nectarines, and apricots are tolerably wholesome. Cherries and plums 
are indigestible, and plums are apt to give diarrhoea. 

;{ Fruits," says Dr. Cameron, " are used as a staple food in many 
warm countries ; but in most parts of Europe they are regarded chiefly 
in the light of luxuries. Deprived of their stones or seeds, they contain 
often not more than five per cent, of solid matter. They are very poor 



Quinces. —Medlars. — Apples. 



in albuminoids ; but they are usually rich in sugar, and many of them 
contain much acid. There is the greatest variation in the relative amounts 
of pectose, sugar, and acid in edible fruits. Berries contain, as a rule, 
more acid than stone fruit. Th~ grape contains from thirteen to twenty 
per cent, of sugar ; the cherry only one and a half per cent. In the peach 
there is about nine per cent, of soluble pectin and gum, whilst the goose- 
berry includes only two per cent, of these bodies. In the common fruits 
the percentage of free acids varies from a mere trace to about three per 
cent. The pear is almost wholly free from acids, whilst the currant often 
contains three times as much free acid as sugar. The grape is probably 
the best fruit adapted for the sick. As heat-and-force producing foods, 
five pounds and a half of grapes, six pounds and two-thirds of apples or 
cherries, ten pounds and three-quarters of currants, and twelve pounds 
and one-third of strawberries are equal to one pound of starch. The 
dietetic value of the fruits is chiefly due to their fine flavour and their 
abundance of saline matter. 

Quinces. 

In season : October to November. 

Quinces improve the flavour of apple tarts, and make excellent mar- 
malade, resembling Guava jelly in flavour. 

Medlars. 

In season : November to December. 

Medlars are never eaten till they are in a state of decay ; they are not 
much in demand. 

Apples. 

In season : non-keeping, July to September ; keeping, October to May. 

The apple is the most useful of fruits. It supplies the cider counties 
with their ordinary beverage, and, cooked, furnishes us with an excellent 
food for old people and children. Every housemother will value the 
apple, and knows well its uses. Apples may be kept on shelves with straw 
under and over them, nicely covered. They must not touch each other, 
and should be often turned and examined. They must not be left in too 
cold a place as they will freeze, and if they thaw in the light are apt to 
decay. Keep them, if possible, not frozen. They should also be kept in 
a distant part of the house, or an out-door shed or room, as the smell of 
kept apples is extremely disagreeable and penetrating. There are many 
good keeping apples. The French crab has been known to keep for 
three years. The golden reinette and old nonpareil keep well. 

Apples and pears are better kept between two layers of cotton wool — 
this is the American mode of keeping them. Choose apples by weight ; 
the heaviest are the best, and large apples save the waste of peeling and 
co.vcimr, 



Pears. — Strawberries. — Cranberries. 189 



Dessert Dishes of Apples. 

Take twelve large green apples, green them as for preserving, and put 
them on a tin plate or dish ; whisk the White of six eggs to a very stiff 
froth, rub them over with it, sift loaf sugar over them, and put them in 
the oven until they look bright and sparkle like frost ; then take them 
out and arrange them carefully in the dish you intend to serve them on, 
pour some good custard round them, and stick a flower on every apple. 

Apple Love-Knots. 

Take the pulp of the apples after the juice has been taken from them, 
rub them through a sieve, weigh it, and put it into a pan, stir it well over 
the fire until it boils, then put to it half the quantity of white sugar sifted ; 
let it come to a boil ; then pour it on a large flat dish, and run it about 
the thickness of a crown piece, put it into a cool oven, and when dry cut 
it into long strips with a paste cutter and twist them into knobs. Put 
them in a tin or glass in a very dry place. You may put cochineal to 
some of the strips.

The pear is a very delicious fruit, and by extreme cultivation and care 
is produced of great size and delicious flavour. There are an immense 
variety of pears for eating and keeping. Pears should be covered with 
paper and hung up by their stalks so as not to touch each other. It is a 
good plan to cover the tip of the stalk with sealing-wax as we do to natural 
flowers for wearing in the evening ; or wrap them in a layer of cotton, but 
never suffer them to touch each other. 

Strawberries. 

In season : June and July. 

This delicious fruit received its name from the practice of the people 
in tying them down straws as cherries were often sold tied down sticks, 
The strawberry grows wild in many parts of England in the woodlands, 
but our cultivated varieties have many of them been imported from other 
lands. This fruit makes a delicious preserve, and is eaten fresh as a 
dessert fruit. 

Cranberries, 
In season : fresh, Sept. and Oct. ; imported, Nov. to Jan. 

The Cranberry grows best on the muddy margin of a pond, or in bog 
earth. It is a native of England and all the north of Europe, but American 



i go Barberries. ^-Currants. — Raspberries. 

cranberries are the best ; the flavour is a pleasant acid. It is used for 
tarts, but is not so common as the garden berries are. It is also pre- 
served, and is imported during the winter months. 

Barberries. 

In season : July and August. 

The Barberry or berberry is of three kinds — the common red, the 
stoneless, and the sweet. The barberry makes an excellent preserve, and 
is a pretty breakfast or dessert dish. {See plate.) 

A Pretty Dish of Barberries. 

Select the finest barberries, taking the largest bunches to preserve 
whole. Divide the fruit, pick half 'of them off their stems ; put them into 
a preserving pan with sufficient water to make a syrup ; boil them till 
they are soft ; then strain off the juice, and to every pint of syrup put a 
pound and a half of pounded loaf sugar. Boil and skim it well, and to 
every pint of this syrup put half a pound of barberries tied in bunches. 
Boil them in it till they look clear, then put them in glass bottles for use, 
tied down with paper dipped in brandy. When you wish to use them 
make a mound of fresh moss and stick them over it by their stems. This 
dish is used for ornamenting a supper or breakfast table. 

Currants. 

In season : July and August. 

Currants belong to the same genus of plants as the gooseberry. They 
are red, white, and black. The white and red serve for dessert fruits ; the 
black is used exclusively for pies, puddings, and jams. Crystallized cur- 
rants in moss are an elegant dessert dish. Take some of the finest 
bunches of red and white currants. Well beat the whites of three or 
four eggs, and mix with the stiff froth a quarter of a pint of spring water. 
Dip each bunch of currants separately into the egg water. Drain them 
for a minute, holding them by the stems ; roll them in finely-powdered 
loaf sugar ; repeat this till you get enough sugar on them. Lay them on 
white paper to dry before the fire. The sugar will then crystallize. Make a 
mound of moss, and stick them in it by the stems. {See plate.) 

Raspberries. 

In season : July and August. 

Raspberries are called travelling plants, because if left alone they run 
along in suckers to a considerable distance, thus propagating themselves. 
The best are the red and yellow Antwerp. The raspberry belongs to the 
same genus as the bramble or blackberry. Raspberries are eaten in tarts 
with red currants, or alone, preserved, or made into raspberry vinegar— 
an excellent remedy for sore throat. 

Raspberries and strawberries will remove tarter from the teeth.

The Gooseberry is a common and very useful fruit. It will keep well, 
bottled green, or it makes a delicious preserve ; it can be used for tarts 
also while unripe, and for fool. Gooseberry bushes should be in every 
poor man's garden. 

The skin of the gooseberry being very indigestible is never swallowed. 
Gooseberries are useful for cooling the system ; the acid in them is very 
wholesome. 

The small hairy sort of gooseberry is best for preserving. The large 
yellow and old-fashioned red gooseberry are best for dessert. 

The gooseberry is very good food ; perfectly dry it is nearly as nourish- 
ing as wheaten flour.

The Peach is supposed to be a native of Persia, and was introduced 
into England about the middle of the sixteenth century. The peach and 
the nectarine are only varieties of one species of almond. The two fruits 
have been known to grow on the same tree without grafting. Both are 
divided into two kinds : the free stones, the flesh of which parts readily 
from the stone ; and the cling stones, the flesh of which adheres to the 
stone. The earliest peach is the Red Nutmeg, which ripens in July. The 
Grosse, Mignonne, Belgarde, and Barrington are good peaches. 

The best nectarines are the Ebruge, the Violette native, and the white 
nectarine. These fruits are very wholesome. 

The Apricot. 

In season : green, May ; ripe, July and August. 

The Apricot is a native of America, introduced in 1562. Its culture is 
the same as that of the peach. The fruit is suffered to form, and is then 
thinned out while it is green, in May or the beginning of June. Green

apricots make delicious tarts, and are therefore not wasted. The apricot 
makes also an excellent jam. The best for preserving are the Brodie ; 
the Moorpont are best for table. Soap-suds poured round the root of the 
apricot tree is believed to improve the fruit. 

Beignets d'Abricots. 

Split some apricots in half, remove the stones and skin, roll each half 
in powdered loaf sugar, dip in butter, and fry. 

The Plum. 

In season : August and September. 

An indigestible stone fruit, which, however, makes excellent jam, and 
good tarts ; cooked, it is wholesome. 

The Cherry. 

In season : eating cherries, June and July ; morella, September. 

The Cherry is also indigestible when not cooked. It is said to have 
been brought to England by the Romans, Lucullus having imported it to 
Europe from the countries on the Black Sea. It is excellent in brandy, 
and contains itself a strong spirit which may be extracted. A relative 
of the writer once achieved this manufacture. He had a quantity 
ofmorella cherries put into a large earthenware bread pan, with their 
equal weight of large lumps of white sugar. As it was impossible to stir 
this mass, two of the men servants rolled the pan from side to side, thus 
the juice was extracted. It was left to ferment, and became a cherry- 
flavoured spirit much stronger than cherry brandy generally is ; the 
cherries were bottled with it. Cherries make good tarts, and are a plea- 
sant fruit for the table. 

Pickled Cherries. 
Take three pounds of morella cherries, one and a half drachms of mace, 
one and a half drachms of white pepper, one and a half drachms of cloves, 
one and a half drachms of cubebs, one pound of loaf sugar. All the 
spices are to be bruised. Boil the bruised spices in four pints of white 
vinegar, and pour it warm over the cherries. Cut off half their stalks, and 
prick each cherry in three or four places. The cherries must be pickled 
when ripe, and will be ready for use about Christmas. — Food Journal. 

The Fig. 

In season : September and October. 

The Fig will grow and bear well in any soil it likes. It thrives and 
bears well in London and the neighbourhood. The fruit is delicious and 
wholesome. The preserved figs eaten in England are imported from 
Smyrna and the Levant. The fig is exceedingly nutritious ; it contains 
nearly as much gluten as wheaten bread, and is twenty-seven per cent, 
richer in starch and sugar. Any poor man who can grow a fig-tree near

his home will find its fruit help to nourish and sustain his children ; yet, 
strangely enough, there are places in rural England where the poor will 
not eat figs, but give them to their swine as food. 

Mulberries. 

In season : September and October. 

There are three distinct species of Mulberry — the white, the black, and 
the red. The white mulberry is the tree on which the silkworm lives. It 
is scarcely ever grown in England. 

The black mulberry is said to be a native of Persia, but was early 
brought to Europe, and was introduced into England long before 1573, as 
many large trees were then in existence in our country. The leaves of the 
black mulberry — the one generally found in our gardens — are not good 
for silkworms, nor are those of the red mulberry, the fruit of which is not 
good. Only lettuce leaves should be used for silkworms in England. The 
mulberry is later in coming into leaf than any other tree, but when its buds 
once open the leaves expand, and the fruit forms very rapidly. It needs 
very little care from the gardener, and no pruning. The fruit drops off as 
soon as it is ripe ; therefore it is usual to plant the tree in the centre of a 
soft lawn, that the berries may fall without being bruised. The juice of the 
mulberry extracted as a syrup is good for colds and sore throats. 

NUTS. 

In season : hazel nut andjilderl, September and October. 

Nuts are an indigestible food, full of oil, and valuable rather as a 
source of pleasure by affording us the delightful amusement of Nutting 
than for any other use they may be to us. The hazel nut is a native 
fruit. 

The filbert is only a variety of the common hazel. It is supposed to 
derive its name from the words " full beard," applied to it at first on ac- 
count of the length of its husk. The best nuts grow in Kent. Filberts are 
reared in orchards, also about Maidstone and elsewhere : they are trained 
with short stems like gooseberry bushes. 

Filberts may be kept for two years by packing them when quite ripe 
and dry, in their husks (in which they are always served), in earthen jars. 
A layer of salt must be spread over the fruit, and the jars must be tied 
down closely with brown paper. They must be kept in a cold place. 
If they get black and mouldy-looking they may be renovated before using 
by putting them on a strainer or colander, and shaking them gently over a 
chafing dish of red-hot charcoal over which a little powdered sulphur has 
been thrown ; the fumes will restore their appearance and render them fit 
to send to table. 

The Almond. 

The Almond is grown for its kernel also, and may be called a nut, but 
it is in fact a peach tree. Almond trees are cultivated in England only 
for their flowers — the fruit is imported from Malaga.

194 Chestnut. — Walnut 



The Chestnut, 

Imported : September and October to December. 

There are two kinds of chestnuts— the sweet or Spanish chestnut, and 
the horse-chestnut. The sweet chestnut (Casta?iea vesca) of Asia ; it has 
also been found in the north of Africa and in North America. We call it the 
Spanish chestnut, because the best chestnuts for the table were formerly 
brought from Spain. 

Chestnut-trees are now grown in England, but the fruit used by us is 
imported. There are several celebrated chestnut-trees of enormous size 
and great age. The Castagna di Cento Cavalli, on Mount Etna, is famous 
for its great proportions, and also the Tortworth chestnut in England. 

In the south of France and north of Italy the nuts serve as food in 
place of bread and potatoes. Chestnuts are dried and laid by for winter 
use. There is no doubt that chestnut-flour would make a palatable 
bread. Chestnuts are used in Galette, Polenta, Maroon glace, and in 
many other ways. 

For dressing them as a dessert fruit, for stuffing turkeys, etc., receipts 
will be found in Warne's " Model Cookery Book." 

The Walnut. 

In season : fresh, September and October ; for pickling, July. 

The Romans called this fruit the "Nut of Jove;" the Greeks dedi- 
cated the tree to Diana, and held festivals under its shade. With us, it is 
associated with pictures of rural life and repose ; for of old the walnut- 
tree flourished on many a village green and by many a cottage door. 

Our readers have, doubtless, heard the old adage : — 

•* A woman, a spaniel, and a walnut-tree, 
The more you beat them the better they be." 

A third of truth is certainly contained in it, for beating a walnut-tree 
really does improve it, by breaking off the points of the too luxuriant shoots, 
and making them send out the short spurs which alone produce the nut. 
We may add, thztflrumng answers the same end. Walnuts are an excellent 
nut, and the green walnut makes a good pickle. They are best when eaten 
just as they fall from the tree, when their green envelope breaks, and the 
ripe nut will open on the pressure of finger and thumb ; but they will also 
keep well for some time. 

A decoction of the leaves and husks of this tree will protect plants 
from insects if sprinkled on their leaves. It is also a powerful dye. 

If walnuts become shrivelled, soak them in hot milk and water for 
seven hours before sending them to table. This will make them plump up 
and peel easily.

The Grape is the most wholesome of fruits, and a grape diet has of late 
years been recommended as a cure for consumption. 

The grape is chiefly cultivated in hothouses, and attains great perfec- 
tion in them under skilful culture. It grows small in the open air, though 
we have tasted very sweet small grapes from open-air vines. 

Grapes are also imported, and can be had at a moderate price in the 
winter. Cut bunches of grapes should be hung up in loose bags of tissue 
paper till required. If they have been kept long, clip the stalk of the 
bunch and put it into a wineglass of claret, or port wine ; the wine drawn 
up by capillary attraction will refresh the grapes for eating. 

Melons, 

In season : forced, July to September : foreign, July to September. 

The gourd tribe are remarkable for the water they contain. The 
melon contains 94 per cent, of water. They are the fruits of hot dry 
climates. In our cold lands they are less needed, and tax the digestion cf 
a weak stomach. Eaten with pepper instead of sugar — an Asiatic custom 
— the melon is not unwholesome. It makes a delicious preserve. The 
imported Spanish melon, of great size, may be bought for about 2s. 

Pine Apples. 

In season : forced, June to August ; foreign, all the year, nearly. 

A very expensive hothouse fruit, but to be bought cheaply enough — for 
about is. 6d. to 2s. or 3J. from the fruit shops. The cheap pines are 
imported from the West Indies. 

Pine-apple preserve is excellent, but the fruit is not easy of digestion. 

Flavour of Fruit. 

To obtain the full, true, delicious flavour of a strawberry or peach, 
gather the fruit one day in advance and shut it up closely in the fruit- 
room, and it will then be fit for the dessert and a credit to the cultivator. 
A second-class fruit prepared by this course of procedure will actually 
surpass a first-class fruit eaten freshly gathered ; yet the current notion 
is, that soft fruits cannot be too fresh, and that the keeping of them dete- 
riorates their flavour. — Gai'dener's Magazine.

Cotton as a Preservative of Fruit. 

It is not generally known that common raw cotton is one of the best 
and most simple means of preserving fruit for a long while. In America 
it is in general use for keeping grapes fresh all the winter. The method 
employed is as follows : — The bunches are gently laid between a layer of 
cotton in a glass or earthenware jar. The jar is then corked down and 
the corks dipped in melted resin. 



THE STORE-ROOM. 

A large airy, cool and dry store-room is a great boon — a small airy 
closet will, however, suffice if a large one is not to be had. Shelves, hooks 
and nails in the walls, or on the edges of the shelves, are essential ; a few 
little nets for hanging lemons, earthenware jars and tins, are also required. 

A book and pencil should be kept in the store-room ; in this book 
every article purchased should be entered, with its date and price on one 
page, " taken out," should head the other page ; and on it should be en- 
tered everything given out of the store-room. 

The cook should be supplied, once a week, with the ordinary things 
required — such as kitchen tea and sugar, rice, candles, soap, etc. etc. — in 
fact all she can possibly want. On that day week she should account for 
all she has used, and bring any remainders, which can be made up to the 
average quantity. If the housemother prefers giving out the store-room 
articles daily, she should still enter them in her book at the time. 

In this manner, the consumption of stores will be constantly checked. 
Say, the housekeeper has given out so many pounds of bedroom candles ; 
a glance back will show whether they have lasted the proper time, when 
the housemaid comes to ask for more. Say, that a pound of tea is to last 
her and the cook a fortnight ; if she asks for more in ten days, a glance at 
the book will reveal the irregularity ; it will also betray too great a con- 
sumption of lemons, nutmegs, etc. etc., or any other article. 

A store-room should be dry, clean and cool. In the coolest and driest 
part should be kept the jams, pickles and preserves. Tin boxes must hold 
biscuits or cakes. Coffee should not be kept in quantities unless it is 
unroastcd, which is the best way to buy it ; the berry, if not roasted, will 
improve by keeping ; if roasted it loses its flavour, even when kept in tins. 

Tallow candles should be purchased in March, as they will then have 
been made in the winter, and will keep well. We have written largely on 
the subject of candles in " Domestic Science," to which we refer our 
readers for every information respecting them. 

Soap should be bought, for cheapness, by the cwt. if possible ; if not, 
by the bar ; it should be cut in pieces for use, and put in a drawer, or on 
the floor of the store-room to dry and harden slowly, which will make it 
last much longer. 

Starch must be kept in a dry place. 

Sugar, sweetmeats and salt, must be kept very dry. 

Rice, tapioca, sago, etc., must be kept close covered, for fear of insects. 



Stores Required. — Vinegar.

Lemons should be purchased, for keeping, in June or July, when they 
are cheapest. They must hang in net ted bags. 

Eggs may be preserved by brushing over with gum, and laying them 
in a cool place, or they may be washed with quicklime, saltpetre, and an 
ounce of cream of tartar. 

Fresh eggs should have the date of their being laid written on them. 

The housekeeper should always have also a ball of string, a hammer, 
nails, a pair of scissors, and a box of gum in her store-room. 

Spices must be kept in tins. Pickles and dry preserves and lemon peel 
in glass bottles, which may be hermetically closed by means of gelatine caps. 
Gelatine mixed with glycerine yields a compound which is liquid when 
hot, but becomes solid by cooling, at the same time retaining much elas- 
ticity. To apply it, dip the neck of the bottle into the liquid mixture, and 
by repeating the operation the cap may be made thicker.

beginners : —

Vinegar; 

Vinegar (acetic acid) is the acid of malt. It is obtained also from 
various other sources — from wine, cider, sugar, and wood. Good table 
vinegar can also be made from the vinegar-plant. 

This plant is a kind of fungus growing on wet sugar and treacle, and 
consists of a gelatinous substance of a pale brownish colour. If placed 
in a jar with a solution of sugar and water, or a mixture of sugar, treacle, 
ind water, and allowed to remain for six or eight weeks in a kitchen cup- 
board, the solution will be converted into vinegar ; the change is produced 



198 How to make Vinegar, etc. 

by fermentation caused by the plant. The plant grows at the same time, 
perpetually doubling itself when the growth is removed. 

It was an observation made by Scheele, but the fact has recently been 
published as a new discovery, that ordinary brown vinegar will keep bright 
and clear for any length of time if heated to the boiling-point for a few 
minutes. 

Vinegar is refrigerant and moderately stimulating applied externally. 

How to make Vinegar at Home. 

Fourteen lbs. of moist sugar, 7 gallons of hot water, 8 quarts of cold 
water, a toast spread with yeast. 

Put the sugar into 7 gallons of water, boil and skim it tho- 
roughly ; then pour in the cold water. When it is cool put in a 
toast spread with yeast Stir it for nine days, then put it in a clean 
nine-gallon cask. Cover the bunghole with a piece of slate, and set the 
cask in the sun. It will be ready to use in six months. 

March is the best time to make it. Cost, 4s. lod. the cask, about 6\d. 
per gallon. 

To make Cider Vinegar. 

After cider has become too sour for use, set it in a warm place ; put to 
it occasionally the rinsings of the sugar-basin or some molasses or any 
remains of ale or cold-tea ; let it remain with the bung open, and you will 
soon have the best of vinegar. 

The following is Dr. Ure's receipt for making Malt-vinegar : — 
" One boll of good barley malt properly crushed is to be mashed with 
water at 160 Fahrenheit. The first water should have that temperature. 
The second must be hotter than 160 ; and the third water, for the extrac- 
tion of all the soluble matter, may be boiling hot. Upon the whole not 
more than 100 gallons of wort should be extracted. After the liquor has 
cooled to 75 Fahrenheit, three or four gallons of beer yeast are poured in 
and well mixed with a proper stirrer. In thirty-six or forty hours, accord- 
ing to the temperature of the air and the fermenting quality of the mash, 
it is racked off into casks, which are laid upon their sides in the ferment- 
ing apartment of the vinegar-works, which should be kept at a tempera- 
ture of 70 at least ; in summer by the heat of the sun, or by stoves. 
The bunghole should be left open, and the casks should not be full in 
order that the air may act over an extensive surface of the liquor. It would 
be proper to secure a free circulation of the air by boring a hole in each 
end of the cask near its upper end." 

How to make the Vinegar Plant Grow, and Vinegar from it. 

Get a quarter of a pound of sugar, and the same of treacle ; add to 
them three pints of water ; boil all together and put in a pan ; cover it 
over with net, and set it in a warm place for six weeks, in which time the 
plant will be formed from the sugar and treacle. You may then remove 
the plant and boil the vinegar : get a fresh supply of sugar, water, and 
treacle, put your plant on it, and proceed as before with a plant. The 
vinegar will be made in a month.

How to detect Adulteration of Vinegar by Minerals. 

Copper. — If you suspect copper, dip a clean piece of iron into the 
vinegar ; if copper be in it a rose-colour coating of copper will remain on 
the iron. If you suspect 

Lead, use bisulphuret of soda. If put in vinegar which contains lead, 
a white precipitate will remain — sulphuret of lead. If 

Iron, prussiate of potash produces a blue precipitate. 

There are various modes of making vinegar with acid wines. The 
most simple and natural consists in placing the wine in a flat tub, and leav- 
ing it open and exposed to the air and the sun. In the summer it will re- 
quire from six weeks to two months, according to the alcoholic strength of 
the wine, to turn it into vinegar. In the winter, when the influence of the 
sun is not sufficiently powerful to cause the evaporation of the alcohol in 
the proportion desired, the temperature must not be below 6o° Fahren- 
heit. To hasten the operation, it is well to use a vessel that has already 
held vinegar, and then to add to the wine some boiling vinegar, in the 
proportion of, say, ten parts of vinegar to 100 parts of the wine, leaving 
the liquid exposed as above stated. Another mode of completely acidu- 
lating the wine is to add five per cent, of strong acetic acid to the quantity 
of wine. Vinegar can thus be obtained in the space of about three weeks. 
If the wine be red, the vinegar will be red also. When white or slightly 
coloured vinegar is desired, the extra colouring matter can be taken off by 
means of animal charcoal. For this purpose, when the vinegar is tho- 
roughly made, a tap is affixed to the cask or other kind of vessel. A funnel 
of about six inches in diameter is taken, lined with ordinary filtering paper, 
and filled up with coarse-ground animal charcoal. It is then placed in a 
bottle or jar under the tap, and the liquid is allowed to drip very slowly 
through it. When the animal charcoal is so impregnated with the colour- 
ing matter of the liquid that it decolorizes it no more, then the funnel 
must be emptied and replenished with fresh filtering paper and animal 
charcoal ; the vinegar will, however, look better if slightly tinted. The 
discoloring process can accordingly be regulated. 

Store Vinegars. 

Camp VINEGAR. — Two heads of garlic, one ounce of Cayenne pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls of walnut ketchup, two tablespoonfuls of soy (or instead, 
six anchovies chopped up), vinegar one pint. Infuse for two months. 
Strain and bottle. 

Horseradish Vinegar is made by scraping up about six ounces of 
the root, and putting it into three pints of vinegar. Let it stand for a 
fortnight or three weeks ; then strain for use, and bottle. 

Shallot, Onion, and Garlic Vinegar are made in the same way, 
by putting them into vinegar in the proportion of 1 oz. to 1 pint of vinegar, 
letting them stand for a fortnight ; then straining and bottling. 

Chilis and Capsicums.— In the proportion of an ounce to a pint of 
vinegar. Stand a fortnight or a little longer ; strain and bottle. 

Tarragon Vinegar. — To one pound of tarragon leaves, one gallon 
of white-wine vinegar. The vinegar is made according to the following 
receipt : — Strip off the leaves just as the plant is going into blossom, 



2oo Sauces. — Salt. 



and add the vinegar in the above proportions. Put it into a stone jar to 
ferment for a fortnight. Then run it through a flannel bag, and to every 
two gallons of vinegar put one quarter of an ounce of isinglass dissolved 
in a little cider. Mix it well ; let it stand a month ; then bottle it and tie 
it down closely. 

Cress Vinegar. — Dry and pound half an ounce of cress-seed (the 
same that you sow with Mustard-seed), pour on it a quart of the best 
vinegar ; let it infuse for ten days or more. Shake it every day. 

Celery Vinegar. — Half a pound of celery seed, one pint of vinegar, 
a little salt : or, ten ounces of fresh celery root cut up very small. Put the 
celery (or seeds) into a jar, boil the vinegar and pour it over them. Set it 
to cool ; bottle it in wine bottles, and cork it down. Let it stand fut a 
month, then strain it into small bottles and cork for use. 

Cayenne Vinegar. — One ounce of good Cayenne to one quart of best 
vinegar. Put the Cayenne in a jar, pour the vinegar over it cold ; cover 
it closely, let it stand for a month. Then strain it through muslin and 
bottle for use. 

Tomato Vinegar. — Three dozen tomatoes, half a pound of salt, a little 
mace, cloves and nutmeg, one clove of garlic, half a pint of mustard-seed, 
two quarts of vinegar. Quarter the tomatoes, but leave the bottoms undi- 
vided, rub half a pound of salt over them and place them in a wide- 
mouthed jar in a cool oven, or by the side of the fire for two days. Add 
then the garhc, spices and mustard-seed, and pour over all the vinegar 
boiling hot. Tie a bladder over the jar, and let it stand by the fire for five 
or six days, shaking it well every day. Put it by in the same jar as long 
as convenient. When you want to bottle it, press out and strain off all the 
liquor ; let it stand several hours to clear, then bottle it. 

The sediment can be used for sauce to cutlets at once. 

A Good Acid Sauce. — One quart of vinegar, half a bottle of soy, 
half a bottle of ketchup, half ounce of Chilis and four or five shallots 
chopped very fine. Put all into a jar and shake every day for a week, 
and then bottle for use. 

SALT. 

Component parts, when pure : 39/4 parts of sodium and 6o*6 chlorine. 

Salt is absolutely required for the support of health. Upwards of half 
the saline matter of the blood consists of common salt ; the necessity of 
supplying its daily waste is therefore obvious. It has been known for ages 
past that without salt man would perish, and in former periods of history 
i barbarous punishment (entailing certain death) was that of feeding a 
culprit on food destitute of salt. It is required in the bile and for the car- 
tilages of the body ; the digestion would be impaired unless it were sup- 
plied, and the cartilages cannot be rebuilt as fast as they waste without 
its aid. 

Table salt is obtained by the evaporation of water from brine springs ; 
it is also dug out of salt mines. 

Salt is of great value for the preservation of meat ; it prevents the de- 
composition of flesh at a temperature below 6o°, but above that heat it 
cannot control putrefaction. It is therefore scarcely safe to salt beef or 
pork in very hot weather unless ice be used in the pickling. But eve» in 



Mustard. — Pepper. 201 



the height of summer meat may be safely cured if ice enough is added to 
the pickle to keep it as cool as 55 degrees. 

Meat is salted either by rubbing salt into it with the hand, or by im- 
mersing it in pickle or brine. The flesh absorbs the salt and gives out its 
watery particles in return, which form brine. Sugar is used in addition 
to salt, and is no doubt a valuable agent in pickling, for this reason — 
Oxygen is the great decomposing agent, that is, it is oxygen which causes 
decay. Now carbon absorbs oxygen, and as sugar contains a great deal 
of carbon it absorbs the oxygen, and thus helps the salt to preserve the 
meat. These would be about the ingredients of a good pickle : Four and 
a half pounds of common and fine salt, three gallons of water, one pound 
of moist sugar, one ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of salteratus. For 
many varied and all good modes of making pickle we refer the reader to 
Warne's " Model Cookery Book." 

Salt in store must be kept in a dry place. 

Mustard 

Is a native of Europe, and was introduced into England before 1548. 
Our readers may remember how Grumio teased "the Shrew" by proposing 
" the mustard without the beef;" and how Bottom spoke to Mustard-seed 
the fairy : " Good Master Mustard-seed, I know your patience well ; that 
same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your 
house ; I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now." 
In George I/s reign, a Mr. Clements prepared and sold Durham 
mustard, but the condiment had (on the above authority) been long pre- 
viously in use. 

Mustard is of the easiest culture possible. The white mustard, which 
we eat in its seed leaves with cress, may be raised by spreading the seed 
in a saucer on wet flannel. 

The flour of mustard — mixed for the table — is made from the ground 
seeds of the black mustard, extensively cultivated in England for that 
purpose 

A good supply of mustard should be kept in the storeroom in the coun- 
try, as it is a valuable article in cases of inflamation, cold, or poisoning. 

The seeds of the black mustard contain a volatile and fixed oil of 
mustard, and two substances known as myronic acid and myrocene. 
These substances are not found in white mustard. Myronic acid con- 
tains sulphur and nitrogen. Myrocene is an albuminous matter which 
coagulates in hot water, and is necessary to the formation of the essential 
oil. Therefore mustard must be always made with hot water. 

Table mustard mixed with hot water is a strong emetic, and spread as 
a poultice will relieve cold on the chest, etc. etc. 

Mustard owes its peculiar odour, burning taste, and blistering quality 
to its volatile oil, which resembles that of horseradish. 

Pepper. 

Constituent parti : Acrid resin— Essential oil— Piperine. 

Pepper, unlike the other spices, possesses a nitrogenized principle, 
called Piperine. Its effect on the human body is the same as that of the 



202 Curry Powder. — Olive Oil. 

Theine in tea, Caffeine in coffee, and Theobromine in cocoa ; consequently 
it is extremely wholesome. 

Pepper is the berry of the pepper plant known as Piper nigrum and 
longum. Black pepper is the entire berry of the Piper nigrum ground ; 
white pepper is the same berry ground without its husk or outer covering. 
Peppercorns are these berries whole. They are imported from Malabar, 
Sumatra, and Penang. They should not be too small or shrunk in drying, 
and should sink in water. 

The Piperine is contained in the white or internal structure of the berry. 

Cayenne Pepper is made from the pods of capsicum plants. This 
pod consists of an outer skin which contains a principle called capiscin, 
very powerful on the oigans of sneezing ; an inner substance, and a num- 
ber of small seeds. The whole pod is ground up to make Cayenne. 

This pepper is more wickedly adulterated than any other article of 
food. The mixtures with it being red lead, Venetian red, red ochre, 
vermilion, and common salt. There is no possibility of defending one's 
self from these poisonous deceptions except by dealing with first-class 
tradesmen, or by getting friends who go to Africa or the West Indies to 
bring it home with them. We know a lady who prepares the pepper 
herself from the pods, and sells it, to the great benefit of her neighbours 
and the poor. The writer uses it herself in preference to any other. 

Dr. Kitchener gives the following receipt for making it : — 

" Four hundred large chilies, a fourth part of their weight in salt. 
Take away the stalks and put the pods into a colander, set it before the 
fire ; they will take twelve hours to dry. Then pound them to a fine pow- 
der in a mortar with the salt. Bottle and keep. This receipt makes a 
quarter of a pound of Cayenne pepper."* 

We think a few dried Capsicums might be added with advantage, but 
unless home-made Cayenne pepper is procured, the article is scarcely ever 
pure. Considering its importance as a cure for one kind of sore throat, 
and its digestive uses, this is much to be regretted. 

Curry Powder. 

The best and purest is to be bought only at Apothecaries' Hall. 

Curry powder is adulterated with red lead. 

Receipts brought from India for excellent curry powder are given in 
Warne's " Model Cookery Book f we subjoin another original one. 

Half an ounce of cayenne, one ounce of mustard, half an ounce of 
black ground pepper, half an ounce of salt, a quarter of a pound of tur- 
meric, a quarter of a pound of coriander seed, one ounce of pounded 
cinnamon, one ounce of ground ginger, two ounces of fenugreek, and a 
quarter of an ounce of allspice, mixed, 

Olive Oil. 

The flask of oil must be kept in the driest and above all darkest place 
in the storeroom, as light injures it very much. Olive oil is demulcent and 
laxative. It is an antidote to some poisons, and applied warm to the 

* One hundred chilies will make two ounces of Cayenne. 



Nutmegs. — Cloves. — -Pimento. — Ginger 



skin is an emollient ; combined with hartshorn, it is used as an external 
stimulant. The persecution of musquitoes and of our own midges may be 
prevented by slightly brushing olive oil over the skin. It is used in 
cookery for salads, mayonaise and frying fish. 

Nutmegs and Mace 

Are the fruit of the nutmeg tree, of which there are three species— 
Myristica fragrans, Myristica fatua, Myristica malabarica. This tree 
resembles the pear tree. Its fruit is like a large pear in shape, 
and is smooth externally. The outer or fleshy part is the pericarp. 
When ripe it separates lengthwise, and within is the seed or nutmeg 
enclosed in two coverings ; the mace fills up the space between the 
seed and the pericarp. The true or best nutmeg is the seed of the 
Myristica fragrans ; an inferior kind called the false nutmeg is procured 
from the other two species. The true nutmeg is round and of an aromatic 
smell or flavour ; the false nutmeg may be distinguished from it by being 
longer and paler.* 

To Select Nutmegs, prick them with a pin. If they are good, the 
oil will instantly spread around the puncture. 

Mace follows, of course, and is either true or false. The good mace is 
orange yellow, transparent, and horny ; the inferior or false is of a dark 
red colour, and has little flavour or smell. There is a fixed and volatile 
oil in the nutmeg which, if the seeds are eaten alone and in any quantity, 
will produce intoxication. 

Cloves. 
Constituents : Essential oil — Resin — Tannin — Woody fibre. 

Cloves are the fruit, or rather the cup of the unopened flowers of the 
clove tree, Caryophyllus aromaticus, a native of the Moluccas, or Clove 
Islands. Cloves are shaped like a nail, whence the name, from the French 
word clou, a nail. Good cloves have a strong, fragrant, aromatic odour, 
and a hot acrid taste, which is very permanent. 

Pimento, or Allspice. 

Constituents : Essential oil— *Gum— Resinous matter — Astringent extract 

and fatty oil. 

Pimento is the berry of the pimento tree, growing in the West Indies. 

Ginger. 
Constituents: Gum— Starch— Woody fibre— Volatile oil— Acrid resin. 

Ginger is the root of a perennial plant called Zingiber Officinale, growing 
in Asia, Africa, and the Tropics of America. The roots are dug up at the 
end of the first year and prepared for selling. It is sometimes imported 
from Jamaica, preserved as green ginger, and is very delicious. 

Ginger owes its pungency to its volatile oil. 



* If a nutmeg is grated at the stalk end it will be hollow all the way through, 
while if grated from the solid end it will be solid throughout. 



2 04 Cinnamo?i. — Soda. — Rice. — Arrowroot. 

Ground ginger is adulterated with sago, wheat flour, cayenne pepper, 
mustard husks, and turmeric powder. 

Ginger makes a milder poultice for face-ache, etc., than mustard, and is 
of use in cases of flatulency. It is also good for gouty persons. 

Preserved ginger is very delicious. It may be well imitated at home 
by preserving ends of cos lettuce stalks with ground ginger, etc. etc. 

Cinnamon. 

Cinnamon is the bark of the Cinnamo?nu?n, a tree cultivated chiefly in 
Ceylon, and also in Bombay, Malabar, and Java. The three-years-old 
branches are peeled for the bark, and it is dried in the sun. The flavour 
of cinnamon is much liked ; a very little of it flavours. 

The Cassia — the bark of the Cimiamornum Cassia — is sometimes sold 
for the true cinnamon, but it is not so sweet, and has a slightly bitter taste. 

Mixed spice is a compound of ginger, pimento, cassia, etc. etc. It is 
never required by a good cook, who should be able to flavour more skilfully 
than this mixture does. 

Soda, 

Soda, or bicarbonate of soda, is manufactured by the decomposition of 
common salt. It is used for household and cleansing purposes. 

Carbonate of Soda is useful for making effervescing draughts and 
other purposes. It has also the power of altering the colour of plants 
when it is put round the roots.

Rice is not as nourishing as other cereals, though, of course, its use as 
food by the populations of Hindostan shows that it will sustain life ; 
but as we have shown, it takes four pounds thirteen ounces to supply 
five ounces of flesh-forming matter to a working man. Rice makes 
fat, and it has a tendency to constipate the bowels, consequently it 
is given in cases of cholera and diarrhoea. The rices are Carolina, from 
America, Patna, Bengal, Madras, Arracan, and Java. Carolina is much 
the best ; Patna next ; Madras rice is the cheapest. It is well not to 
have too much rice in stock at once. 

Ground rice makes nice custard puddings, a good Blancmange, and 
fritters. It is never used in any other way. 

Arrowroot. 

Arrowroot is a starch obtained from the roots of many plants. 

There is the Maranta Arundinacea, Tacca Oceana, Manihot, and 
Curcu?na roots. Of these, the Maranta arrowroot is considered the best, 
and is sold in England by the name of Bermuda or Jamaica arrowroot. 



Sago. — Tapioca. — Semo/ina, etc, 205 

Arrowroot will not sustain life alone, though it makes pleasant pud- 
dings, fritters, a clear jelly, and a milk posset. 

Potato flour makes a nice imitation arrowroot pudding, and is much 
better for thickening gravies than common wheat flour. 

The goodness of arrowroot may be tested by letting the transparent 
jelly made from it stand for twenty-four hours, when, if the jelly becomes 
thin, the arrowroot is pure. Arrowroot varies greatly in price. 

Sago. 

Sago is the pith of an Indian palm called Sagus iavis. This pith 
is steeped in water, becomes a paste, and is rubbed, when half dried, 
through a perforated plate, which causes it to be easily formed into little 
balls. 

Tapioca. 

Tapioca is the pith of the Manihot tree, washed like sago, but formed 
into different shapes from that pulp. It is brought from Brazil and the 
East Indies. Tapioca is very nutritious and easy of digestion ; boiled 
in milk, or with fruit, or as a pudding, or in soup, it is equally good 
and nourishing. 

Semolina 

Is a preparation of wheat flour— very nourishing. 

Tous les Mois 

Is prepared from the pith of the Camm edulis, but more commonly from 
wheat flour. 

Rice, Sago, or Semolina Pudding. 

Boil two large spoonfuls of rice, etc., in milk, with sugar, lemon-peel, or 
a laurel-leaf until tender. Beat up the yolks of two eggs, and mix them 
with the rice, etc., and milk when lukewarm. Let it stand until cold, and 
just before you want to bake it, beat up the two whites to a stiff froth and 
mix it in the dish with the rice and yolks ; bake it before the fire or in a 
Dutch-oven. 

Maizena. 

Maizena is a preparation of corn-flour. 

Maizena Pudding. 

One quart of milk, five tablespoonfuls of maizena, two eggs, essence 
of lemon or vanilla, sugar to taste ; some candied citron and orange-peel. 

Beat thoroughly five spoonfuls of maizena with two eggs and two table- 
spoonfuls of milk, flavour it with lemon or vanilla ; put the milk over a 
clear fire, sweeten it to taste, and when on the point of boiling stir in very 
briskly the maizena, and let it boil a few minutes, stirring it all the time ; 
place green citron cut into pieces over the bottom and sides of a wet 
mould ; pour out the maizena, adding pieces of orange-peel as it is 
poured in. When cold turn it out on a glass dish. 



2o6 Maccaroni. — Isinglass. — Gelatine. — Soap. 



Maccaroni and Vermicelli 

Are preparations of wheat flour. The flour is mixed with water and then 
forced through perforated plates of a larger or smaller size. The macca- 
roni is forced through large holes — the vermicelli through very small ones. 
There is also a ribbon-maccaroni manufactured, which is not bad. Mac- 
caroni varies very much in quality. 

To Dress Maccaroni. 

Put the maccaroni into boiling water, and let it be kept boiling until 
soft, then let it drain on a sieve, and put it on a dish to serve. Make a 
sauce with cream, butter, and flour, and grated cheese. Mix all, and pour 
over the maccaroni, then grate some cheese over the top and brown. 

Isinglass. 

Isinglass is made from the swimming-bladder of the sturgeon, and 
from other fish. It is a gelatinous substance, and is imported from Russia, 
Brazil, and the East and West Indies. Russian isinglass is the best. 

Ribbon-isinglass is made from the intestines of the cod. 

Gelatine. 

Gelatine is extracted from the bones and hoofs of animals, by boiling 
them at a high temperature. Anything which contains gelatine may be 
made into it. Gelatine is very low-priced. It will make jellies, etc., quite 
well. The smell of dissolving gelatine is like boiling glue. The smell of 
dissolving isinglass is fishy. 

If the housewife has any doubt of the genuineness of the isinglass sold 
to her, the above test is a simple and sure one. 

Soap. 

This useful article should be bought in quantities ; say, half cwt. or 
cwt. at a time, if the family be large ; if small, it should be bought by the 
four bars at once. A bar contains about three pounds of soap. The reason 
for buying a quantity at once is that it hardens by keeping, and therefore 
does its work of cleansing without so much waste in the water. The bars 
should be cut into moderate sized pieces for use with a fine twine, they 
will harden better than if it be left in the bar. Scented soap should also 
be kept for use. If shape is not an object, pieces of scented soap of the 
best kind may be purchased very cheaply of any of the great manufac- 
turers. These are the bits cut off in forming the pats, which, of course, 
they quite equal, except in shape. They are sold by the pound. Soap 
is made ot fat, exposed to the action of a caustic alkali, which produces on 
it a peculiar change called saponification. 

Almost every kind of fat or oil has been used, at different times, for soap. 
Of oils, those of hemp-seed, rape-seed, cocoa nut, beech-seed, poppy-seed, 
palms, almonds and nuts. Fat of any kind (such as tallow, etc.) is also used 



Soap. — Starch. 207 

for soaps. The alkalies used to make soap are potash or soda. Yellow soap 
is made of whale oil, soda and resin ; soft soap, of oil and potash ; hard 
soap of oil and soda. Soda-made soap consists of about 61 parts of fat or 
oil, 84 of soda, and 30! of water. Some portion of the water will evaporate 
if it be kept in a dry place. In common yellow soap, whale oil, or palm oil 
and resin, are used with the soda. Soap made of tallow and potash con- 
sists of about 28 parts of fat, 12 of potash, and 29 of water. This, as we 
have said, is soft-soap. Mottled soap is made by mixing a solution of 
the sulphate of iron with common hard white soap while it is still in a 
melting state. The alkali in the soap decomposes the sulphate, and black 
oxide of iron is deposited in streaks through the soap. 

Brown Windsor is hard white soap coloured with burnt umber and 
scented. 

Glycerine soap is made with hog's lard, oil of almonds, nut-oil, palm- 
oil, or suet and soda, with glycerine added to it. 

Honey soap has no honey in it ; it is simply the same compound as 
glycerine, with the essential oil of citronella added to it. 

Marseilles white soap consists of soda and olive oil, with water. Cas- 
tile soap of the same materials, with more olive oil and soda, and less 
water. It has also colouring matter in it. These soaps are expensive. 

Common soft-soap is made with coarse fish oil ; white soft-soap with 
potash and tallow, as we have before said. Green soap is made with 
vegetable oils, such as rape- and poppy-seed oil ; soft-soap can be made 
hard by the addition of common salt when it is in process of making. 

The best soap for the skin is the very best yellow soap ; it softens it 
excessively, and when nibbed in instead of being washed off, it is useful 
as an external remedy for rheumatism, and used to be prescribed by Sir 
William Fergusson. 

Soap is sold — yellow, at about \\d. per lb. ; mottled, about \d. per lb. ; 
scented soap is sold by the pat, or bar, is. per bar, 3d. or \d. per pat. 

Carbolic soap is a valuable preparation, as it has great disinfecting 
powers, and should always be used in washing the linen of fever patients. It 
possesses also great cleansing power without injuring the material on which 
it is used. Its use is fatal also to house insects. There is also a carbolic 
toilette soap which is excellent in hot weather for the skin. The Kalydor 
soap is also very good for the skin. 

The following process for making soap is practised by emigrants : — 
Two or three gallons of clean water are poured upon about a bushel of 
wood ashes, thoroughly stirred, and the ash is allowed to subside. The 
liquid, which is now a lye, is drawn off and boiled for two or three hours 
with fat of any description. At the end of that time the fat will have as- 
sumed the consistency of soap. It is allowed to settle, and the liquor is 
then drawn off, being no longer of any use. The residue, although soft, 
will answer every purpose for which soap is used. 

Starch. 

Starch is an important constituent part of food, as it assists, with 
sugar and gum, in forming the fat of the body, and in carrying on the 
respiratory process ; but, separately, it is used for stiffening and glazing 
muslins, etc. etc., which are thus preserved clean longer, as well as made to

look better. Clear starching was introduced in the reign of James I., and 
the first clear starchers were Dutch women. The yellow starch, intro- 
duced and made fashionable by the infamous Mrs. Turner, who was hung 
for assisting in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury in the Tower, went 
out of fashion at her death, as she was hung in a yellow starched ruff. 

Many vegetable substances afford starch ; the chief are wheat, rice 
and potatoes. Arrowroot also makes a delicate but expensive starch. 
Wheat starch is made by soaking the grain in cold water till the husk sepa- 
rates and the farina is softened — i.e., till the grains are full of milky matter. 
The mass of grains thus softened is then put under pressure, which forces 
out the milky fluid. This is let stand for some days. A slight fermenta- 
tion takes place ; the gluten is decomposed and changed into acetic acid 
and alcohol, while the starch remains undissolved. It is taken out and 
washed in cold water, then slightly coloured with blue and heated in an 
oven until it cracks into the pieces in which we buy it. 

Rice starch is procured much in the same way, but as it contains 
almost no gluten it is made more easily. 

Potato starch is made by grating raw potatoes into a vessel full of clear 
water, and after sluicing it well, letting the mass settle. The water is 
poured off and fresh water added three times j then the starch remains 
at the bottom of the vessel. 

Arrowroot starch is made by simply pouring a little boiling water on 
the powder. 

Starch will not dissolve in cold water ; it requires boiling water. Its 
price is from $d. to M. per lb. It should be kept in a jar, in a dry place. 

Stone-blue. 

Stone-blue is merely indigo reduced by adding whiting or starch. It 
is used, tied in a bag, to blue water into which .washed linen or muslin is 
dipped. Powder-blue is smalt mixed with a very little starch. 

Candles. 

The manufacture and chemistry of candles have already been so fully 
described in " Domestic Science," that we have little more to add 
respecting them, except that tallow candles are the better for keeping, 
and that winter-made candles last longer than those made in the summer. 
Prices of all kinds vary very much. They are chiefly, 

Wax. Belmontine. Field's Ozokerit. 

Sperm. Price's. Dips (tallow). 

Rock candles and half-hour candles, is. per box of 60, useful for timing 
the going to bed of servants and children. 

Ozokerit candles are the last novelty. Ozokerit is from the Greek ozo 
11 1 smell of" — keros, " wax." It is a vegetable wax, and in its raw and native 
state is of a yellowish colour, of light specific gravity, and somewhat 
fibrous in its structure. It will not burn of itself, but will readily melt on 
a light being applied to it. On being roughly wrapped around a centre, 
even in its native state, it easily and readily consumes. In fact, a rude 
candle can be made of the raw material and a cotton wick. It is found

principally in Austria, Moldavia, the Caucasus, and near the Caspian Sea, 
where it is obtained in great quantities, being largely used in those coun- 
tries for illuminating purposes. It was discovered, about two years since, 
by a Russian military officer, who communicated the fact to M. Gustav 
Siemssen, who has introduced it into England. These candles are much 
liked, as they remain hard at a high temperature. 

Wax candles which have turned yellow may be whitened by rubbing 
them with a spong dipped in a little spirits of wine. 

Savealls are used by all economical people for burning up ends of 
candles and saving waste. 

Oil. 

Colza-oil is that which is chiefly in use in families for the moderator- 
lamp. It is the oil of the Brassica Arvensis, which is grown in France 
and Belgium. It is pressed from the seed, and purified and whitened by 
sulphuric acid. It is often adulterated by mixture with the oil of the 
Brassica rapus — i.e., clarified rape-oil. When pure it does not smoke, 
and has no unpleasant smell. Both the light and cleanliness of the lamp 
depend greatly on the purity of this oil. 

Petroleum and Paraffin lamps cannot be recommended. They always 
smell unpleasantly, and the latter are attended with some risk. Insurance 
offices expect a higher rate of premium where paraffin is used. If, however, 
it is made use of, it should be tested out of doors before it is put into the 
lamp, by pouring a very little into a flowerpot-saucer and applying a light 
to it. If it does not explode it may be used. 

Sand, Glass, and Emery Papers. 

Sand paper and glass paper are made of sand or powdered glass 
glued on to cartridge-paper. Price \d. per sheet. 

Emery is a stone ground in mills and suspended in water. The finer 
sort is found in the water drawn off first ; the coarser follows. It is glued 
on paper in the same way as sand and glass, or can be used in the powder. 
It should be bought at the best shops, as there is great difference in it. 
Good emery paper will last for two or three cleanings ; the bad rubs off 
the first time. Price \d. a sheet. 

To make Emery Cloth. — Buy some emery powder. By washing in 
water (as before explained), get the different degrees of coarseness, cover 
a piece of thin cotton cloth with a light layer of glue, sprinkle over it the 
powdered emery. But it is better to buy the cloth all ready. 

To make Glass-paper. — Take any quantity of brokeu window-glass, 
that which has rather a green appearance on the edge is /.he best, pound 
it in an iron mortar, then have two or three sieves of different degrees of 
fineness ready for use when wanted. Take any good tough paper (fine 
cartridge is the best), level the lumps on both sides with pumice- 
stone, tack it at each corner on a board, and with good clean glue, diluted 
with about one-third more water than is used generally for wood-work, go 
quickly over the paper, taking care to spread it even with your brush ; 
then, having your sieve ready, sift the pounded glass over it lightly, but to 
cover it in every part ; let it remain till the glue is set, take it from the 
board, shake off the superfluous glass into the sieve, and hang it in the

shade to dry ; in two or three days it will be fit for use. This paper will 
be much better than most of that which you can buy, sand being fre- 
quently mixed with the glass, and coloured to deceive the purchaser. 

Elacklead is a carburet of iron, and consists of 92 parts of iron and 
3 of charcoal. Price 6d. per lb. or 10s. per cwt. 

Fuller's earth is of a greyish brown colour. It is scraped off when 
required for use, and absorbs grease easily. 

Washing powders are made chiefly of alkalies, and have the effect of 
pearlash or potash. They remove grease in washing, id. per packet. 

DRIED FRUITS. 

Prunes are dried plums. French plums are the best dried plums. 
Prunes are chiefly used for stewing. French plums are fit for dessert. 

Normandy Biffens are apples dried in stove heat till they look shri- 
velled. They are excellent stewed in syrup. 

Almonds, 

Constituent parts : Gum — Albumen — Sugar — Woody fibre— Fixed oil. 

The almonds (sweet and bitter) are the kernels of two varieties of a 
stone fruit-tree growing in Spain, Italy, and Barbary. An essential oil of 
a highly poisonous nature is distilled from the bitter almond. Of sweet 
almonds, the Jordan are thought the best for dessert.

Grapes are dried for raisins in the sun or by stove heat. Those dried 
in the sun — called raisins of the sun — are thought much the best. The 
common raisins dried in stoves are often very dirty and mixed with much 
refuse matter. The Sultana is a stoneless raisin — very good in puddings. 

There are Muscatels, Smyrna, Valencia, Eleme' raisins, and the Sultanas 
already named. 

Currants, 

Currants are the small grape of Corinth and the Ionian islands dried. 
They are very indigestible even cooked. It is cheapest to buy the verr 
best, as the weight of the common ones is affected by the dirt mixed wit* 
thorn.

The date has been justly called " the Bread of the Desert," for multi- 
tudes of the Arab tribes scattered over the sandy regions of Egypt and 
Arabia live chiefly on this fruit. It grows amid parched sands and arid 
wastes ; wherever a spring of water appears in the desert, this elegant 
palm is found, yielding to the wearied traveller both shelter and food.° 

Preserved Dates are very useful in the English household for dessert 
and also for an especially good pudding. Before sending up for dessert 
they should be put for a few minutes into boiling water to wash them • 
this plumps them up, and makes them look better. They are very 
nourishing. Bread and butter and a date or two make a good li^ht 
supper.

Oranges. 
In season : November to June. 
Enormous numbers of oranges are imported yearly into England, and 
are of the greatest value in the household, being most wholesome and 
greatly needed by people who feed as much as we do on a meat diet. 
Oranges are brought from Spain, Portugal, the Azores, Malta (the blood- 
orange is peculiar to the island)* and Madeira. St. Michael and China 
oranges are also much liked. Oranges are eaten as dessert fruit, and 
also make a delicious compote and fritters. Orange Marmalade, the pre- 
serve of Scotland, needs no mention, though we beg to add to the many 
excellent receipts already known, two more of superlative goodness. 

Grated Marmalade. 

Grate the rind of the oranges off, then squeeze the pulp through 
a sieve, using a little water, say about a pint to four pounds of 
oranges ; then put on to boil with the sugar, one pound to one pound of 
fruit, and the gratings ; boil till you find the gratings soft, or about half 
an hour. You may add a lemon. 



* The Maltese blood-orange is produced from the common orange-bud grafted 
on the pomegranate stock. The juice is as red as blood and of fine flavour.

Marmalade with Chips, 

To each pound of oranges put two pints of water and two pounds of 
sugar. The oranges to be peeled, and the peel cut into thin chips, the 
pulp and juice bruised together, and nothing kept out but the seeds. 
The whole is then put into a brass pan and boiled for three hours and a 
half, when the sugar is added and boiled half an hour longer on a slow 
fire. Two lemons to six pounds of oranges. 

Orange Compote. 

Time, five or six minutes. 

One pound of sugar — eight oranges — a pint and a half of water. 

Boil a pound of sugar in a pint and a half of water, with the peel oi 
eight oranges cut very thin, for nearly twenty minutes, removing the scum 
as it rises. After the oranges are peeled, remove all the white pith without 
breaking the inner skin, divide them into quarters, and put them into the 
syrup, and let them simmer for five or six minutes ; then take them care- 
fully out with a skimmer or spoon, and arrange them in the centre of a 
glass dish (as in plate) with the skins downwards. Boil the syrup until 
thick, and when cool, pour it carefully over the orange quarters, and set 
them in a cold place until ready to serve. 

Red Crystallized Oranges. 

Take off the skin and pith from some China oranges, taking care not 
to cut them through, and pass a double thread through the centre of each. 
Powder and sift a pound of loaf sugar, add it to the whites of two eggs, 
add Cochineal to colour the liquid, and whisk it for nearly twenty minutes. 
Hold the oranges by the thread, and dip them into the beaten egg and 
sugar, covering every part with it ; then pass a piece of thin stick through 
the thread, and fix it across a very slow oven for the sugar to dry. 

Lemons. 

In season : all the year. 

Lemons (from which the useful citric acid is obtained) are imported 
and are to be had all the year, but come freshly into England in June. 

They are an absolutely requisite article of housekeeping, being used 
for flavouring all kinds of cookery, seasonings, made-dishes, puddings, 
jelly, etc. etc. 

They should be kept hung up in little netted-string bags. The juice 
can be kept bottled. Lemons also furnish a very good pickle. When 
only the juice is required, the cook should peel the lemon before squeezing 
it, and the peel should be hung up in the empty bag to dry for use. 

Preserved Lemon Peel. 

Cut the lemon peel into thin slices ; make a thick syrup of white sugar ; 
allow the peel to simmer in it till tender, that will be in less than half an 



Candied Peel. — Eggs. 



hour ; put it into a jar and tie closely down with a piece of bladder as for 
any other preserve. 

Candied Orange or Lemon Peel, 

Boil the rind from thick skinned oranges or lemons in plenty of water, 
until they are tender, and the bitterness is out ; changing the water once 
or twice. Clarify half a pound of sugar with half a cup of water for each 
pound of peel ; when it is clear, put in the peel, cover them, and boil them 
until clear, and the syrup almost a candy ; then take them out, and lay 
them on inverted sieves to dry ; boil the syrup with additional sugar, then 
put in the peels, stir them about until the sugar candies around them, then 
take them on to a sieve, and set them in a warm oven, or before a fire ; 
when perfectly dry, pack them in a wooden box, with tissue paper between. 

To Keep Lemon Juice. 

Buy the lemons when cheap, keep them in a cool place two or three 
days if too unripe to squeeze at once ; cut the peel from some, and roll 
them under your hand to make them part with the juice more readily ; 
others you may leave unpared for grating ; when the peel shall be taken 
off and dried, squeeze the juice into a china basin ; then strain it through 
some muslin, which will not permit the least pulp to pass. Have ready 
half and quarter-ounce phials perfectly dry ; fill them with the juice so 
near the top as only to admit half a teaspoonful of sweet oil into each 
ottle, or a little more if for larger bottles. Cork the bottles and set them 
upright in a cool place. 

When you want lemon-juice, open such a sized bottle as you can use 
in two or three days ; wind some clean cotton round a skewer, and dipping 
it in, the oil will be attracted ; and when all shall be removed, the juice 
will be as fine as when first bottled.

The egg consists of the shell, the white, and the yolk. The shell is 
composed of carbonate of lime, — that is, chalk. It is full of minute pores 
or holes through which the air passes for the use of the young bird in the 
process of hatching. Now as it is the air which causes putrefaction by its 
chemical effect, we can only preserve eggs by making them air-tight. 
Whatever, therefore, will perfectly close the pores in the egg-shell will 
preserve the egg. 

Rubbing the new-laid egg over with fat or oil, or gum answers well ; 



2i4 The Hen's Egg, 



and there are several other modes of closing them, as packing them in 
bran, or just dipping the egg once or twice in boiling water. Saw-dust 
packing gives a bad flavour to the eggs. The best way is to grease them 
over or gum them, and turn them occasionally from side to side.* 

An egg contains fifty-five parts of carbon, sixteen of nitrogen, seven of 
hydrogen, and the remaining twenty-two are oxygen, phosphorus, and sul- 
phur. The offensive smell of stale eggs is caused from the hydrogen of 
the egg combining with its sulphur and phosphorus, and thus forming 
sulphuretted or phosphu retted hydrogen— two gases which have a horribly 
bad smell. 

It is the sulphur in the egg which uniting with the silver of an egg- 
spoon tarnishes it as soon as it is moistened with the saliva. This tarnish 
is sulphuret of silver. It can be removed by rubbing it with table salt. 

" The yolk of the egg" says Dr. Hunter, " is a natural soap, and in all 
jaundice cases no food is equal to it. When the gall is too weak, or by 
accidental means is not permitted to flow in sufficient quantity, our food 
which consists of watery and oily parts cannot unite so as to become 
chyle. Such is the nature of the yolk of an egg, that it is capable of 
uniting water and oil into a uniform substance, thereby making up for a 
deficiency of natural bile." 

The shell forms more than a tenth part of the weight of the egg, the 
white six-tenths, the yolk three-tenths. 

The white of the egg is the substance known to chemists as alfouncn; 
in a nutritive sense it answers to the gluten of vegetables and fibrin of 
meat. 

The yolk consists of fat and a variety of albumen. It contains also a 
trace of milk sugar. 

The egg is much richer in fat than beef, and is, in fact, only equalled 
in it by pork and eels. 

Eggs are, therefore, very nutritious. The white is constipating, and 
the egg is better eaten without it by invalids or children — we mean simply 
the yolk should be eaten by them. 

Fat eaten with eggs makes them more laxative, hence " bacon and 
eggs " form a judicious mixture. 

The white of the egg has a glairy consistence, which enables it, when 
mixed up with moistened flour, arrowroot, sago, etc., to retain the globules 
of air or of steam which are produced by heat, and thus it enables the 
mixed materials to swell up into a porous mass. Therefore white of 
egg gives lightness to puddings, cakes, etc. When we speak of eggs in 
puddings we mean hen's eggs, because they are the only eggs to be had 
all the year round. 

Turkey and goose-eggs are too valuable for eating in the early summer, 



* M. Burnouf recommends in a French journal of agriculture the following 
method of preserving eggs : — Dissolve in two-thirds of warm olive oil one-third of 
beeswax, and cover every egg completely with a thin layer of this pomade with 
the end of the finger. The egg-shell by degrees absorbs the oil, and each of its 
pores becomes filled with the wax, which hermetically seals them. M. Burnouf 
affirms that he has eaten eggs kept two years in this manner in a place not exposed 
to too great extremes of temperature. He thinks also that the germ may in this 
way be preserved for a considerable time. 



Grandmother* 's Strips.- -Morning Eggs, etc. 215 

but in autumn turkey eggs are often used and are excellent. Ducks' eggs 
are common enough, but they are richer and not so delicate as hens' 
eggs. 

A fresh egg feels heavy in the hand ; but the best way to prove them 
is to try them in water. Put an egg into a basin of water, if it stands 
upright on the end it is bad ; if it lies obliquely it is not quite fresh ; if it 
floats it is bad ; if it lies at the bottom it is quite fresh. A fresh egg takes 
half a minute longer to boil than a stale one. The yolk of an egg sets 
before the white does, and if it is put into cold water, before the water 
boils ; the white becomes fixed at the temperature of scarcely boiling 
water. Very little heat is required therefore for sauces made with yolk 
of egg ; a little more when white and yolk are boiled together. If boiled 
custard, or any milk and egg custard, boils in the dish, the egg runs to 
whey, and the dish is spoiled ; quick boiling converts the white of egg 
into a leathery substance, while the yolk is still moist. The way to make 
water boil slowly — i.e., to delay its boiling, while it gets extremely hot — is, 
as we have said in " Domestic Science," to add a body to it less volatile 
than itself. Salt does it, and it is therefore used for poaching eggs, which 
are plunged suddenly into boiling salt and water, in order to set the albu- 
men speedily. 

There are many modes of cooking eggs. We insert a few delicate 
modes of dressing them : — 

Grandmother's Strips, 

Make a syrup of sugar, marsala, and water in a rather deep stewpan. 
Beat together eight fresh eggs with a dessert spoonful, of flour, or arrow- 
root. Get a colander, the holes of which would be the size of a strip of 
vermicelli, put it over the boiling syrup, pour the beaten eggs in and press 
them through the holes. They will drop in a thin stream into the liquid, 
and will be immediately set, or poached, in these tiny forms. On taking 
them up they are drained and placed on a dish in a pile. Garnish with 
red sweetmeats. 

Morning Eggs. 

Boil one dozen eggs hard, press the yolks through a sieve and add to 
them two ounces of butter, half a spoonful of flour, a little pepper and salt, 
parsley chopped fine, a little nutmeg, and half a pint of very rich cream. 
Stir well together until thick, cut the white in strips, put them into the 
sauce. 

Eggs au G-ratin. 

Boil four eggs hard, cut them in halves, take out the yolks, put them 
into a basin, mix them well together, with a little cream, salt, pepper, and 
grated cheese ; put this mixture into the half whites and brown the tops 
with a salamander. 

Bumbled Eggs. 

Take three eggs and beat them ; add to them a large cupful of cream, 
some nutmeg, white pepper and salt ; mix together in a bowl, have ready 
a frying-pan with fresh butter in it, pour in the ingredients and stir it over 
a slow fire. They are done when they become thick. Serve on buttered 
toast. 



2 1 6 Pickled Eggs.— Tea. 



Pickled Eggs. 

Boil the eggs for twenty minutes ; take them up and plunge fehem in 
cold water, shell them, lay them whole in wide-mouthed jars. Pour over 
them scalding vinegar in which has been boiled pepper, allspice, whole 
ginger, and a few cloves. Let the pickle get cold ; fasten them tightly 
down, and keep for use. They will not be ready for a month. 

Ducks' eggs may be used to advantage in making very rich puddings. 
Swans' eggs are never eaten in England, but in other lands they, as well as 
the eggs of many other birds not known to us, are used, and eat well as an 
omelette, or even simply roasted. 

The water in which eggs have been boiled has a strange power of pro- 
ducing warts on the skin if it happens to touch it j cooks should therefore 
carefully avoid touching egg-water. 

Omelette a la Neige. 

Break and separate the yolks from the whites of six fresh eggs, add a 
pinch of salt, the peel of half a lemon minced fine, and five or six pounded 
macaroons ; mix all well together. Then whip the whites to a stiff froth, 
beat them well into the yolks, and then pour the mixture into a pan of hot 
butter ; stir them round, and raise the edges to separate it from the pan ; 
turn them over, and then turn the omelet on a dish, sprinkle sugar over it 
and lightly brown with a salamander. Have ready the whites of six eggs 
beaten to a very great firmness — as thick as cream. Drop heaps of it on 
the omelet as soon as it is in the dish, and serve quickly. {See plate.) 

To Keep Eggs— American Receipt. 

Take fresh laid eggs, dip each one in melted lard or beef-fat, or rub a 
bit of butter thoroughly over the shell between the hands ; then pack 
!hem, the small end downwards, in bran or chaff. In this way they will 
keep good for months. 

Eggs may be kept good for a year in the following manner : — 
To a pail of water put of unslacked lime and coarse salt each a pint ; 
keep it in a cellar or cool place, and put the eggs in, as fresh laid as pos- 
sible. It is well to keep a stone pot of this lime-water ready to receive 
the eggs as soon as laid. Make a fresh supply every few months. This 
lime-water is of exactly the proper strength ; strong lime-water will cook 
the eggs ; very strong lime-water will rot the shells.

Our truly national beverage is made from the leaf of the tea-plant 



Tea. 2 1 7 

(Thea sinensis), a shrub which bears a great resemblance to the Camellia 
Japonica. The tea-plant is a native of China, and grows wild in some 
parts of that country and of Japan. The leaves of the tea-plant are 
gathered (chiefly by women) in the spring. The tea-harvest generally ends 
in May or June ; they are, however, gathered at three successive seasons. 
— the young and tender leaves giving the highest flavoured tea ; the second 
and third gatherings are bitterer and have more woody leaves. 

The refuse and decayed leaves are pressed into moulds, made hard 
with ox blood, and sold as Brick Tea in Northern China, and beyond 
the Great Wall. 

Tea is either green or black. As it is now well known that the green 
teas are painted with Prussian-blue or indigo, black tea is the general 
choice of the nation ; though some still prefer green. 

The leaves for black tea are spread out and left in the air for some 
time after they are gathered ; they are then tossed about till they become 
soft and flaccid ; next washed for a few minutes and rolled. Afterwards 
they are exposed to the air for a few hours in a moist state, and then dried 
slowly over charcoal fires. The leaf blackens by exposure to the air. 

For green tea the leaves are spread thinly on bamboo-trays for one or 
two hours, and then dried off rapidly and rolled. 

The principal varieties of black tea are — Bohea, Congou, Campoi, 
Souchong, Caper, and Pekoe. The green teas are Twankay, Hyson-skin, 
Hyson, Imperial, and Gunpowder. 

Pekoe, or " White-down," is made from the downy sprouts or leaf-buds 
of plants of three years' growth. 

Caper is in hard grains ; it is made of the dust of the other teas, 
cemented with gum. 

The practice of scenting teas is common, and various sweet flowers 
and odoriferous plants are used for the purpose. 

Tea was brought to England in the seventeenth century only, and was 
immensely expensive. The East India Company made a present to the 
Queen of Charles II. of two pounds of tea as a very costly gift. 

Dried Sage leaves formed the tea of England till then and for very 
long afterwards. They were, in fact, used up to the middle of the last 
century. 

The effects of tea are well known, it " cheers without inebriating f ex- 
cites the brain to activity and watchfulness ; soothes the system, and 
stays the waste of the body. 

This last effect is produced by the substance in it called Theine, 

Theine is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen ; three- 
tenths of its substance being nitrogen. Theine has, as we have said, 
the remarkable power of sensibly diminishing the waste of the body. 
Now, as we eat to supply this waste, it follows that if the waste be less 
we shall want less food. Tea, therefore, saves solid food while it cheers 
and soothes the spirits. For old people — in whom the daily waste of the 
tissues is greater than in the young — tea is very valuable ; while the poor, 
who have scanty food, reasonably cling to their " cup of tea," as their 
great stay and solace. 

It is wise in the poor to buy good tea (as they almost invariably do), 
because the support is greater in the purer beverage than when adul- 
terated with sloe-leaves, etc. 



2l8 



Adulteration of Tea. — Coffee. 



Baron Liebig has shown that THEINE is of all substances the most 
easily converted into bile, and that by means of tea this necessary fluid 
can be produced in those who are ill-fed or take little exercise. 

The fashion of the five o'clock cup of tea is therefore evidently a wise 
one. 

Tea-leaves contain a great deal of gluten, and if eaten would be as nutri- 
tious as beans or peas. This fact is worth knowing in case of famine. 

A pinch of soda in the water poured over tea, dissolves a portion of 
this gluten and renders the tea more nutritious, 



Adulteration of Tea. 

Congou and Souchong are the teas which reach England unadul- 
terated by the Chinese. English adulterations are sloe-leaves and black- 
thorn-leaves dried, broken in pieces, and mixed up with a paste made of 
gum and catechu, or Japan earth ; ash and plum-leaves, silkworm dung, 
dung of pigs and dogs, or exhausted tea-leaves bought from hotels, re- 
dried, mixed with gum and faced with rose-pink, or blacklead, or copper, 
for green tea. 

Taking these frauds into consideration, we think it is wise to buy of a 
first rate dealer, whose honour may be relied on. 

Souchong is the finest of the strong black teas ; Pekoe the most 
delicate. 

Tea to preserve its flavour must be kept in lead. 

To make tea, take care that the water boils : tea cannot be made with 
any but boiling water. A teaspoonful for each person and one over " for 
the pot," is the quantity required ; let it stand five minutes. Keep the 
tea-pot (if possible) covered with a woollen " cosy." 

Flesh-producers remain with the tea-leaves, but may be taken up, as 
we have said above, by putting a little soda in the water.

The Coffee tree is a native of southern Abyssinia, where it grows in 
the countries of Enarea and Caffa like a weed. Coffee was brought from 
Abyssinia to Arabia in the beginning of the fifteenth century. About the 
middle of the sixteenth century it reached Constantinople, and became an 
article of general consumption. In 1652 the first coffee-house was opened 
in London by a Greek named Pasqua, and twenty years after the first 
French coffee-house was opened at Marseilles. 

Ceylon, Jamaica, Costa Rica, and Brazil supply us with coffee. 

The Arabian or Mocha, considered the best, is small and of a dark 
yellow colour. Javan and East Indian are larger and of a paler yellow. 



Coffee. 219 

Ceylon, West Indian, and Brazilian coffees have a bluish or greenish 
grey tint.* 

The coffee tree is an elegant tree, covered with a dark shining and 
evergreen foliage. It flourishes in a dry soil and warm situation. It has 
pale white fragrant flowers, and its fruit grows in clusters. Inside the 
fruit are the berries or seeds which we use. 

Berries improve in flavour by keeping — of course unroasted. The 
Mocha berries will ripen in three years, and bad coffee will in ten years 
be good and of fine flavour. 

Everybody knows the good effects of coffee. It cheers the spirits, 
rouses us and keeps us awake, and counteracts stupor caused by fatigue or 
by opium. To a certain extent it allays hunger, by retarding the waste in 
the tissues of the body. With coffee to drink much less food is required— 
as much as one-third less, the great chemists tell us. 

Coffee has great medicinal virtues ; it is said to be an excellent anti- 
dote to gout, and to cure other painful diseases. 

Coffee-tea must here be mentioned. It is made from the leaves of the 
coffee-tree roasted over a clear fire till they become of a dark buff colour. 
They are then separated from the twigs, the bark of which is roasted, rubbed 
off and used with the leaves. They are immersed in boiling water, give 
a brown infusion, and with sugar and milk form a very pleasant beverage. 
They have a fragrant odour like that of tea and coffee mixed. They are 
said to have great effect on the body and mind, strengthening the former 
and making the intellect clear and active. A greater portion of theine is 
found in them than in the coffee bean itself. Coffee is sometimes mixed 
with chicory. 

It is best to buy unroasted coffee-beans and roast them as required. 
Coffee can be bought wholesale at is, per pound, but as dealers will not sell 
less than twenty-eight pounds weight at that price, it must be bought un- 
roasted, or it would not keep. 

Coffee makes better if the powder be warmed first before the water is 
poured on it. 

Roasted beetroot is a substitute for coffee.t The root is roasted and 
ground and made in the same manner. The root of the dandelion, also 
furnishes a coffee which is excellent for the liver. It is called Taraxacum 
coffee, and can be bought at all chemists. 

Allow for each person a dessert spoonful of coffee ; use a biggin, as it 
should be made with boiling water, but not boiled. Coffee keeps people 
awake, and should not therefore be drank at night. 



* Of course that is unroasted. 
f Cut it in slices, add a little piece of butter to prevent burning, and roasl 
them dry over a good fire ; then powder them.

The Mexican Cocoa is the seed of the Theobroma cacao, a small tree 
with bright dark green leaves, which grows in the West Indies and the 
central regions of America. It grows wild in Mexico, and there are whole 
forests of it in Demerara. In the Mauritius and Isle de Bourbon it is 
cultivated. It was first known in its best form as chocolate — the Mexican 
name being chocolatl, and was brought to Europe by the Spaniards in 
1520. Timseus gave this tree the name of Theobroma — food for the gods 
— on account of the beverage being so delicious. 

The fruit of the tree, which grows like the fig from the stem and 
branches, is of the form and size of a short but very thick cucumber. 
When ripe the seeds are taken out, cleaned from the marrowy substance 
of the fruit, and dried in the sun. These seeds are called cocoa beans. 
They are of a dark colour, and have a bitter taste. They are gently roasted 
in an iron cylinder, as coffee is roasted, and when the aroma is fully deve- 
loped, they are left to cool. The beans, when freed from their husks, are 
beat into a paste in a hot mortar, or ground between hot rollers ; this 
paste when mixed with sugar and seasoned with vanilla, cinnamon, or 
cloves, is chocolate; mixed with starch, sugar, and other ingredients it 
forms the ordinary breakfast COCOA. The husk, which is removed from 
the bean and crushed into fragments, forms the cocoa nibs — the purest 
state in which cocoa is sold. 

Chocolate is made into sweet cakes and bonbons, which are very 
nutritious and strengthening — a few being capable of giving great support. 
Chocolate scraped to a powder and boiled in milk is very refreshing and 
nutritious. 

The cocoa powder mixed with boiling milk is now a common morning 
beverage ; it is alterative, heat-giving, and flesh-forming. 

One reason of its usefulness as an article of diet is the presence in it 
of the substance called theobromi?ie. This substance contains carbon, hy- 
drogen, nitrogen, and oxygen in itself, and is particularly rich in nitrogen, 
which exercises an active influence on the human system. 

Cocoa also contains a great deal of fatty matter called cocoa butter. 
It has therefore great power of nourishing, while the theobromine exhila- 
rates and soothes the spirits, and has a waste-retarding power. 

Cocoa is adulterated with its own husks, starch, sugar, ground roots, 
and red ochre, which is a very injurious substance ; its presence can be 
detected by burning the cocoa in the air ; then examine the ash; if it be 
grey the cocoa is pure ; if red, it is adulterated with ochre.

SUGAE. 



The Sugars in modern use are, cane sugar, maple, beet, maize, and 
palm sugar. The ancients had only honey, grape sugar, manna, and fruit 
sugars. 

Sugar is also maufactured from potatoes, seaweeds, milk, Carrageen, 
Ceylon, and Iceland mosses, and even from sawdust and rags ! 

The cane sugar first claims our attention. It is the juice of the sugar 
cane, a plant which was cultivated in China and the South Sea Islands 
before the historical era ; for it is really a native of the East. Through 
Sicily and Spain it reached the Canary Islands. It was introduced to St. 
Domingo by the Spaniards in 1520, and gradually spread all over the 
West Indies and tropical regions of the New World. It will, however, 
grow far beyond the boundaries of the tropics. It flourishes in a tempera- 
ture of from 77 F. to 66° F. It is grown also in Nepaul, and on the high 
plains of Mexico. The juice of the sugar cane contains : — sugar, 18 to 
22 parts in the 100 ; water and gluten, 71 ; woody fibre, 10; saline 
matter, 1. 

The sugar cane is a very elegant plant ; the sap contains the sugar up 
to a certain height, after attaining which it appears to spend its sweetness 
in nourishing the growing stem and leaves. Consequently only the under 
part of the cane is used for the extraction of sugar. The leaves and 
tops are chopped off, the remainder of the canes are passed between heavy 
iron rollers which crush them, and squeeze out the juice into large vats or 
vessels where it is clarified by the addition of lime. 

Lime neutralizes the acid which forms in the fresh juice, combines 
with the gluten, and carries it to the bottom of the vessel. The gluten is 
removed, because if left it would act as a natural cause of fermentation, 
and cause the sugar to turn to acid. After being clarified and filtered the 
juice is boiled rapidly down, and run into wooden vessels to cool and 
crystallize. 

When the crystals are formed it is put into perforated casks to drain. 
The remainder left is muscovado or raw sugar ; the drainings are molas- 
ses. The molasses and skimmings are fermented and distilled into rum. 

The raw sugar is still further refined by boiling, &c. 

The juice of the sugar cane is so nutritive that it is a perfect food for 
man, capable of sustaining life without any other sustenance ; but this is 
not the case with sugar, because the gluten has been removed. 

Beetroot Sugar comes next in the list of European sugars. It is 
extracted from the sugar beet, which often contains a tenth of its weight 
in sugar ; by squeezing out the juice the raw sugar is obtained, and when 
refined can scarcely be told from cane sugar. Beet sugar is manufac- 
tured in France, Belgium, Germany, and Russia. 

Palm or Date Sugar, or Jaggery. — W 7 hen the top shoot of any 
of the great palms is wounded it yields a quantity of sweet juice, which, 
boiled down, gives the slightly brown raw sugar known by the name 
of jaggery. The date and the gommuti palm both yield sugar. The wild 
date palm, Phoenix Sylvestris, supplies the largest amount of the saccharine 
juice. This date sugar is chiefly consumed in India, but some of it is 
imported into this country and occasionally sold as cane sugar. 



222 Sugar. 

The COCOA-NUT tree has also a saccharine sap which is boiled down 
(in the South Sea Islands) till it becomes a brown syrup resembling 
molasses. 

Maple Sugar is the juice of the sugar maple {Acer saccharinum) 
which grows in New England, and by the lakes, and in the provinces of 
British America. The Canadas produce a great deal of maple sugar. 

In several parts forests of maple trees cover the country, and from 
them large quantities of maple sugar are obtained. Incisions are made in 
the trunk for the purpose of collecting the sap, which is gathered twice a 
day. The first which issues from the tree after an incision is made, is clear 
and without taste or colour ; but after standing a day or two it becomes 
sweet, and a few days after the sap runs sugary from the tree. It is 
boiled down to the crystallizing point, and poured into brick-shaped 
moulds in which it becomes solid. Specimens of maple sugar of every 
kind may be seen in the Food Gallery of the South Kensington Museum. 

The brown-coloured sugar is preferred on account of its maple flavour, 
but the clear sap when carefully boiled in glazed pots will yield a beautifully 
white sugar, which cannot be distinguished from cane sugar. The molasses 
drained from maple sugar is very pleasant to the taste, and is an American 
luxury. 

Maize Sugar is made from the green stalks of maize or Indian corn, 
which, when boiled down, give a good sugar juice. 

Potato or Starch Sugar. — Starch of any kind is dissolved by 
boiling and becomes a sticky jelly ; by the addition of a little sulphuric 
acid it is converted into grape or honey sugar. One pound of acid to one 
hundred pounds of starch will suffice to convert into sugar, potato, wheaten, 
or sago starch. By a further chemical process a solid sugar can be ob- 
tained — i.e., the acid is separated by lime, and the liquor boiled down. 
Or if sulphuric acid be objected to, malt may be used for the same pur- 
pose. Fifteen pounds of malt are added to one hundred pounds of starch ; 
it is subjected to a heat of 160 F. or 170 F. for three hours, then filtered 
and evaporated. This sugar is used for adulterating cane sugar, and in 
the manufacture of spirits. Brandy is also distilled from it. 

Sulphuric acid has also the marvellous effect of changing paper, cotton, 
or flax, cotton and linen rags or sawdust into sugar by the same operation, 
only demanding a longer time to achieve the transformation, as it first 
changes the material into starch, and then the starch into sugar. Robin- 
son Crusoe would have rejoiced to know that from starch he could manu- 
facture sugar for himself. The barley supplying the malt. 

The MOSSES known as Carrageen (collected on the coast of Ireland), 
Ceylon, Iceland, and many other seaweeds, yield when boiled in water a 
jelly which is very nutritious and wholesome in itself, and can be con- 
verted by sulphuric acid into sugar. 

Sorghum Sugar and Sugar Millet are Chinese sugars. Sorghum 
is the juice of the sorghum, a kind of D hurra plant. 

Coarse brown sugar, though the cheapest, is not profitable to purchase. 
It is mixed with woody fibre and grit, and contains a kind of fungus resem- 
bling the yeast plant. Dr. Hassall found in it the Acarus sacchari, or 
sugar mite, an insect which resembles the itch insect, and which he thinks 
may cause the grocer's itch, a complaint attacking people who handle 
sugars. Good moist sugar is light in colour, dry, and crystallized ; the 



Molasses and Treacle. —Honey. 223 

more it is crystallized the better it is. Bad moist sugar is damp, heavy 
and not crystallized. It is no economy at all to buy it, as it outweighs 
the good. Lump sugars differ very little ; the price being affected chiefly 
by the colour. The whitest is the dearest. 

MOLASSES AND TREACLE. 

Molasses is the drainings of the raw or unrefined sugar ; treacle the 
drainings of refined sugar. 

Sugar contains four to ten per cent, of moisture ; treacle, about twenty- 
three. The rest is carbonaceous matter, but contains no nitrogen. 

They are therefore heat-producing and fattening agents. 

HONEY. 

Honey is the sweet juice of flowers prepared for our use by the honey- 
bee. The working bees extract it from the nectaries of the flowers, deposit 
it in their crop or honey-bag, which is an expansion of the gullet, 
and disgorge it when they return to the hive. Some chemical change 
probably takes place in the juice while secreted in the insect's crop, and 
transforms it to honey. When suffered to stand for a length of time 
liquid honey thickens. 

If it is then pressed through a linen bag, a thick syrup will flow out, and 
crystals of solid white sugar will be found remaining in the strainer. This 
is precisely the same as the grape sugar procured from raisins. 

Honey contains besides this grape sugar yellow colouring matter, 
wax, and gum. Honey is flavoured by the flowers which feed the hive. 
Hence the honey of Crete, Minorca and Narbonne is flavoured with rose- 
mary, that of Hymettus with thyme, Provence honey with lavender, Cuba 
honey with the orange flower. 

Sometimes honey becomes poisonous by the bees sucking the rhodo- 
dendron, azalea, monkshood, or kalmias. 

The honey of Trebizond causes headache, vomiting, and a species of 
intoxication in those who eat it. 

It was probably a rhododendron honey which intoxicated the soldiers 
of Xenophon, during the famous retreat of the Ten Thousand. 

Strong spirits are obtained from fermented honey — Mead, Metheglin, 
and Hydromel — but they are no longer used in England. 

To Keep Honey. 

Heat strained honey to the boiling point, and store it in covered jars, 
when it will keep without candying. To prevent danger of burning, set 
the vessel in which it is to be heated into another containing water. 

American Honey Cakes. 

One quart of honey ; half a pound of powdered white sugar ; half a 
pound of fresh butter ; two lemons ; one nutmeg, and one pound and three- 
quarters of flour. 

Press the juice from the lemons, strain the honey ; mix the honey,

powdered sugar, and butter together with the lemon-juice. Put them in a 
stewpan and warm them slightly over the fire till the butter is softened ; 
shake into it gradually a pound and three-quarters of flour (sifted). Make 
it into dough stiff enough to roll out ; beat it well with a rolling-pin, then 
roll it out to half an inch thick ; dip the top of a tumbler in flour, and cut 
this paste into rounds with it : lay them in tin pans, slightly buttered, ana 
bake them. 

Honey Cakes, 

Three pounds and a half of flour ; one pound and a half of honey ; 
half a pound of sugar ; half a pound of butter ; half a nutmeg grated ; 
one tablespoonful of ground ginger ; one teaspoonful of saleratus, or car- 
bonate of soda. 

Mix the sugar with the flour and grated ginger, and work the whole 
into a smooth dough with the butter beaten to a cream, the honey and 
saleratus, or soda, dissolved in a little hot water. Roll it a quarter of an 
inch think, cut it into small cakes, and bake them twenty-five minutes in 
a moderate oven. 

Honey Noyau. 

Time to make, ten days. 

Four ounces of bitter almonds ; two ounces of sweet almonds ; two 
pounds of loaf sugar ; juice of three lemons ; two quarts of gin ; two large 
tablespoonfuls of clarified honey ; one pint of milk. 

Blanch and pound the almonds, and mix them with the sugar, which 
should be rolled. Boil the milk, and when cold, mix all the ingredients 
together, and let them stand ten days, shaking them every day. Filter 
the mixture through blotting paper, bottle off for use, and seal the corks 
down. 

Seeds and Dried Vegetables for Winter Use. 

Keep celery and parsley seed in the store-room for flavouring soup 
and making parsley sauce. The seed boiled giving the flavour. 

Liebig's extract of meat can be flavoured by boiling vegetables, herbs, 
etc. in water first, and making the soup with this flavoured boiling water. 
A preparation of vegetables — i.e. f of finely shred carrots, turnips, onions, 
celery, etc. is sold in packets by La Compagnie Francaise d' Alimentation 
for flavouring this soup also, but the vegetables boiled and the water used 
will be found the better way. As an addition to stock made from bones 
alone, flavoured with vegetables, Liebig's extract is most useful ; a capital 
and most nutritious tureen of soup being produced from the admixture of 
a very small quantity of the extract. 

PICKLING AND PRESERVING. 

Pickling is preserving fruit or vegetables in vinegar. Orleans, or white- 
wine vinegar, though the dearest to purchase, will be found the cheapest 
in the end, as it keeps best : indeed the success of pickling depends on the 
goodness of the vinegar. It must, if boiled, be done in saucepans lined 



Pickling and Preservi?ig. 225 



with unglazed earthenware, or in stone pipkins ; if these are not to be had, 
the vinegar must not be suffered to remain a moment longer than neces- 
sary in the tin saucepan. Wooden spoons must also be used in preparing 
pickles, as the vinegar acts chemically on metal ; also no glazed earthen- 
ware may be used for keeping it, as the vinegar acting on the glaze pro- 
duces a mineral poison. 

Everything relating to the art of pickling will be found in Warne's 
" Model Cookery Book," but we add a few general instructions of our own, 
Here is an East Indian mode of pickling : — 

Take one pound of raw ginger, soak it in water one night, then cut it 
into thin slices and lay it on a clean sieve to dry. Take two ounces of 
long pepper, cut it in slices as you did the ginger ; then take a pound of 
garlic, lay it in strong brine for three days, and then dry it as you did the 
ginger. Then mash it well, or cut it in slices. Put a quarter of a pound 
of mustard seed into a mortar with half an ounce of turmeric, half a pound 
of made mustard, and plenty of Cayenne pepper. When all these ingre- 
dients are prepared put them into a large stone jar, with a gallon of 
vinegar, stir it well and often for a fortnight and tie it over closely. Into 
this pickle you can put any kind of vegetables which have been first well 
dried. 

The whole process is a cold one ; the vinegar is not to be boiled. 

This pickle will keep good for years if replenished occasionally with 
vinegar. Keep it filled with vegetables. 

Then there is the simple one of cold vinegar alone, without mustard or 
spices : — Half fill some large glass bottles with vinegar, drop into it any 
vegetables which being hot in themselves do not require spices, etc. In one 
bottle put capsicums and chilis ; in another, horseradish, eschalots or 
garlic. Fill each bottle and cork the bottles well down, tie them over with 
bladders. 

Horseradish must be scraped and cut up in rounds about half an inch 
thick. 

The other mode of pickling is with hot vinegar. It should not be 
boiled, as it loses its strength by evaporation. The vinegar must be put 
with the spices into a stone jar, bunged well down and covered with a 
bladder. It may then stand in the oven for three days, shaking it two or 
three times a day. The vegetables should be prepared by laying them in 
brine, or sprinkling them with salt for a day or two ; then put them into 
glass bottles and pour the hot vinegar on them. In every case the vinegar 
must be two or three inches above the vegetables or they will not keep, 
for the vinegar will gradually be absorbed in the pickles and will therefore 
shrink. When this is the case more vinegar must be added. 

These modes of pickling will answer for all vegetables but wslnuts, 
artichokes, and beetroot, which must be done over the fire themselves. 
See " Cookery Book " for these especial pickles, and for many others. 

Samphire. — This seaside wild plant, very much used in the reign of 
our good Queen Bess, is now not common. Our readers doubtless re- 
member the passage from " King Lear," in which Shakspeare alludes to 
the dangers to which the samphire gatherer was exposed. 

"How fearful 
And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low ! 

Q 



2 2 6 Pickling and Preserving. 



The crows and choughs that wing the midway air, 

Show scarce so gross as beetles ; halfway down 

Hangs one that gathers samphire ; — dreadful trade I 

Methinks he seems no bigger than his head. 

* * * * * * « 

I'll look no more 
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight 
Topple down headlong. " 

One has some reason to rejoice that this "dreadful trade" is no longer 
remunerative ! 

Samphire when gathered for immediate eating, is only put into equal 
parts of sea-water and vinegar. For pickling, steep it in brine for two 
days ; then put it into a jar with vinegar and bake in a cool oven all night, 
the top of the jar must be covered with a paste of flour and water. When 
it is done and cool, remove the paste, put the pickle into a glass bottle, 
fill up with cold vinegar and tie down as for all pickles. 

Barberries pickled for garnishing, are dropped into cold vinegar. They 
must be gathered before they are ripe. Nice bunches to be chosen. 

Another Mode of Preserving Barberries. 

They must be gathered when not over ripe, and the leaves and dead 
stalks should be picked off ; after which they should be placed in jars in 
a large quantity of salt and water, and tied down with a bladder. They 
must be looked at occasionally, and as soon as a scum is seen to rise on 
them they should be put into new salt and water. 

Nasturtium Buds. 

Gather the seeds in sunny weather, and sprinkle them with salt for a 
day or two. Drain them from the salt, wipe them, and put them into a 
pickle bottle. Boil some vinegar, with one ounce of salt to every pint of 
vinegar, pepper-corns and allspice. Let it get cold and cork closely down 
for use. These seeds will serve instead of capers for sauce for boiled 
mutton, or they may be eaten as pickles. 

Glass bottles should be used to keep pickles in, and they must stand 
in a very dry place. 

A friend of the writer advises improving the purchased pickles rather 
than making them wholly at home. He takes some bottles of Crosse and 
Blackwell's piccalilli, turns out the contents and washes them well with 
plain cold vinegar. Then he boils up vinegar, ginger, whole peppers, and 
a quarter pound of mustard together and pours it over the pickles, restores 
them to their bottles and ties them down. 

List of Vegetables for Pickling at Certain Periods. 

In July and August. — Capsicums, cauliflowers, cucumbers, chilis, 
gherkins, onions, nasturtiums, walnuts, radish pods, French beans, red 
cabbage, samphire, shalots, garlic. 

October and September. — White cabbage, mushrooms, forked horse- 
radish, for vinegar. 

Melons (as mangoes), artichokes, etc., about August. 



Preserving. — Bet lung. 227 



Pickles should bs examined often ; if any mould appears the vinegar 
must be boiled up with spices. 

Fill the bottles up with vinegar when it has sunk below the pickles. 
Red cabbage is the most wholesome pickle. 

Preserving. 

The requisites for making jams and jellies are enamelled or iron pre- 
serving-pans (no other should be used), a wooden spoon, a hair-sieve, and 
a jelly-bag ; copper and brass pans are dangerous on account of the 
chemical action of the fruit acid on the metal ; doubly-galvanized iron or 
block-tin pans are safe, but they are apt to injure the colour of the 
preserves. 

The sugar used for jams is called preserving sugar, it is a coarse white, 
and costs about $d. per pound at present ; it takes three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar to one pound of fruit for preserving, with the exception of 
damsons, which require equal weights of sugar and fruit. 

The great secret of preserving well is the boiling, which must be suf- 
ficiently long, and sufficiently quick. The following general directions 
will, it is hoped, suffice in a work of this kind. 

Gather the fruit in sunshine if possible, if not, in perfectly dry weather, 
and without dust. Pick the fruit off its stems, etc., top and tail goose- 
berries ; boil all fruit for jellies or jams alone for twenty minutes, to eva- 
porate the water they contain ; skim carefully. Make the sugar warm 
before the fire meantime, then add it to the fruit and stir gently but con- 
tinually, removing the scum as it rises till the jam is done thoroughly. 
Then put it in white jam-pots to cool. Next day cover with paper 
saturated with white of egg or starch. 

Different fruits require different times for boiling. Excellent directions 
for every one of them will be found in the " Model Cookery Book." 

Keep jams in a cool place, or they will be liable to ferment. Examine 
the pots now and then. If the paper at the top is stained, or the jam has 
run over the sides of the jar, it must be opened and the jam boiled up again. 

Clarifying sugar for sweetmeats is a confectioners art ; it will be found 
in the " Model Cookery Book," p. 594. 

Candying fruits is done by first preserving the fruit in sugar syrup, 
then washing the syrup off in hot water, drying the fruit before the fire, 
and sifting double-refined sugar over it till it is quite white ; it is then put 
in a moderate oven to dry. 

For jellies the juice only of the fruit is boiled with the sugar, and 
finally strained through the jelly-bag. 

Bottling, 

This mode of preserving fruit depends wholly on the exclusion of the 
air from the bottle in which they are put. The following is the best 
plan : — 

Nearly fill a dry bottle with dry fruit, say cherries (do not break the 
fruit in any way — cut off the stalks), add to every pound of cherries three 
ounces of sugar ; tie them tightly down with starched paper covered with 
bladder, keep them in the oven all night, putting them in at nine o'clock 
in the evening. Remove them next morning before the fire is lighted ;

put them in a dry, cool, dark cellar, or bury them in the garden head 
downwards and at least a foot deep, mark the spot and dig up when 
required. 

Preserving in Spirit. 

The fruit must be pricked with a fine needle, sugar strewn over it, and 
the glass bottle filled up with brandy or wine, as required. See " Model 
Cookery" for individual receipts. 



There is very little economy in home-made jams in London, or indeed 
anywhere else unless the housemother has a garden and home-grown 
fruit. Crosse and Blackwell's jams and jellies are excellent, and allowing 
for fire, labour, and possible failure, it is as cheap to buy jams and jellies 
as to make them ; but in the country and with a good fruit garden this is, 
of course, not the case, and the good housekeeper will do well there, in 
making jams and jellies, according to good receipts, for household use. 

Herb Mixture, 

Two ounces of knotted marjoram, two ounces of winter savory, one 
ounce of basil, one ounce of tarragon. 

Rub these dried herbs together and put them into a spare clean dry 
pickle bottle. Cork them closely down for future use. 

Preserved Meats, 

Potted preserved meats when bought at a tradesman's who can be relied 
on are excellent. Potted ham, tongue, beef, bloaters, etc., are very useful 
for breakfast or light supper. Cold boiled beef sold in tins, cold chicken, 
etc., are excellent, so also are beef and bouilli, but it requires a little 
additional flavouring. Australian boiled mutton is also a cheap and 
excellent food. For invalids, Joubert combines meat extract with iodine 
and bromine, and recommends the combination in cases of chlorosis and 
consumption. Two gr. extr. carnis are mixed with fifteen ctgr. kal. iodat. 
or kal. bromatum. — Food Journal. 

The potted soups all require flavouring and the addition of fresh 
vegetables, wine, lemon-juice, ketchup, herbs, etc ; but well-managed they 
save trouble. They are not, however, as cheap, nor (when it is well made) 
as good as home-made soups. They are is. a tin. 

One tin of the Condensed Swiss Milk should be kept in the store-room 
as a resource if the milk of the house fails. It is diluted with warm 
water for use, according to the taste and judgment of the user. 

We conclude in the words of a Journal which every housekeeper 
should take in : 

" Let me recommend two convenient additions to the store closet. 
Pastilles for soup, which consist of balls composed of vegetable matter 
(sold in bottles, and costing about a halfpenny a ball), are invaluable for 
colouring and flavouring soups, only requiring to be added with the meat 
or bones ; as are also dried mushrooms, an Italian preparation, but un- 
fortunately three times the price in London that one has to give in Italy ;

nevertheless, in flavouring dishes a little goes a long way, and they can of 
course be used when mushrooms are out of season. Both the pastilles and 
mushrooms are to be obtained at Piccirillo's, Wigrhbre-street, London. 

"Do not throw away as utterly worthless the remainders of lemons 
which have been peeled and squeezed. Lemons have very cleansing pro- 
perties, and such fragments if put into the scullery soap-dish will cleanse 
both the hands of the cook, and her saucepans,"— Food Journal 

Night Lights. 

Nightlights are merely short pieces of stearic acid, or stearine, with a 
fine wick enclosed in a thin roll of paper or wood shaving. They are burnt 
in a little glass or china stand holding water to prevent the envelope igniting. 
They are sold at 6d. the box, A good supply should be kept in the store- 
room, and a box at a time should be given to the housemaid. 



A FEW USEFUL RECEIPTS. 



Brown Colouring. 
To make for keeping. 

Into a clean fryipg-pan put a quar- 
ter of a pound of brown sugar. Place 
this over a slow fire, then gradually 
heat it until the sugar boils and 
the steam bubbles disappear, and 
are followed by others from which 
issue little puffs of white smoke. 
When these appear all over the sur- 
face the caramel, as the sugar is 
then called, is in its best condition. 
Remove it from the fire, and add 
a pint of lime water.* This will dis- 
solve all the true colouring. Strain 
it through muslin, and preserve it 
in a bottle for use. The more sugar 
used the darker will be the colour- 
ing. 

Colourings for Jellies, Ices, or Cakes. 

For a beautiful red, boil fifteen 
grains of cochineal, finely powdered, 
with one and a half drachm of cream 
of tartar, in half a pint of water, 
slowly for half an hour, adding a 
piece of alum the size of a pea ; or 
sliced beet-root and some liquor 



poured over it, may be used. For 
white, use almonds finely powdered, 
with a little water, or use cream. For 
yellow, yolks of eggs, or a very small 
piece of saffron steeped in the liquor 
and squeezed. The juice of boiled 
spinach or beet-leaves may be used 
for green. Chocolate or strong cof- 
fee may be used for brown. 

Orange Fritters. 

Take the peel and white skin from 
three large oranges ; then cut them 
across into slices ; pick out the seeds ; 
dip each slice of orange into a thick 
batter. Fry them nicely, and serve 
them with sugar sifted over each. 

Arrowroot Fritters. 

Put a pint of new milk and the 
same of cream over the fire until it 
boils ; mix two ounces of arrowroot 
very smooth in a little cold milk, 
and stir it as quickly as possible into 
the boiling milk and cream ; add a 
little vanilla, the yolks of eight well 
beaten eggs, and sugar to taste ; stir 
it for about twenty minutes over a 
quick fire, then put it into a deep

winebottle full of hot water, and allowing it to settle for a day. 



Useful Receipts. 



cutlet pan, and bake it about ten 
minutes in a quick oven. When it 
is cold, cut out the fritters with a 
round cutter, and egg, bread-crumb, 
and fry them ; glaze and send them 
up very hot, with greengage or 
apricot sauce in the dish. 

Pink Fritters. 

Boil a large beet-root till it is ten- 
der, and then beat it fine in a mortar ; 
add the yolks of four beaten eggs, 
two spoonfuls of flour, and three of 
cream ; sweeten it to your taste, 
grate in some nutmeg, and the peel 
of half a lemon, and add a glass of 
brandy. Mix all well together, and 
fry the fritters in butter ; garnish 
them with green sweetmeats, apricots 
preserved, or green sprigs of myrtle. 

Raspberry Fritters. 

Grate two Naples biscuits ; pour 
over them half a gill of boiling 
cream, and set it to cool. Beat the 
yolks of four eggs into a strong froth, 
and then beat them into the soaked 
biscuits. Add two ounces of sugar 
pounded fine, and as much raspberry 
juice as will flavour it and give, it a 
pink colour. Drop it from a spoon, 
the size of a walnut, into a pan of 
boiling fat, and when done, drain 
them from the fat, stick shreds of 
citron into some, and blanched al- 
monds cut into long strips into 
others. Garnish with sweetmeats. 

Potato Cakes. 

Boil and mash three mealy pota- 
toes ; mix them with three ounces of 
sugar, three ounces of flour, a little 
grated nutmeg, a small piece of but- 
ter, and two well beaten eggs. Make 
them into cakes ; fry a nice brown, 
and serve them on a table napkin. 
(See also Article on " Potatoes.") 

A Bird's Nest. 

Cut the peel of six lemons in long 
thin shreds ; cut the same quantity 



of angelica in shreds ; put half a 
pound of loaf sugar, one ounce of 
gum Arabic, and two tablespoonfuls 
of water into a basin ; stir it till it 
is dissolved, then set it over a slow 
fire, stirring it till it is of the con- 
sistence of melted glue. Take a 
basin, butter it or slightly oil it in- 
side, then lay the shreds of angelica 
and lemon peel in the form of a bird's 
nest inside it; stick them with the 
glue. Make some good isinglass jelly, 
colour it with spinach juice ; take a 
basin about two sizes smaller than 
the first used, butter or oil the outside 
of it ; pour a little jelly over the bot- 
tom of the nest ; stand the second 
basin in the first, and fill up the space 
between the two basins with the liquid 
jelly ; let it get cold — ice it ; turn it out 
carefully, and stand the nest on the 
remainder of the jelly which must 
have been poured flat over a glass 
dish, and let get cold. Make eggs 
of blancmange and place in the 
nest, or beat the whites of eggs to a 
thick froth, and form them into eggs 
for it, flavouring with vanilla ; but 
the blancmange eggs are best, and 
the moulds easily procured. 

A Cheap and Elegant Cream. 

Time, nearly an hour to beat the eggs 
— twenty minutes more altogether. 

One quart of milk ; six eggs ; 
vanilla flavouring ; sugar to taste. 

Set the milk in a stewpan on the 
fire to boil ; break the whites of six 
eggs into one T?asin, and the yolks 
into another ; fr ^at up the eggs to a 
high stiff froth, and as soon as the 
milk boils lay ' u-ge flakes of the egg 
whip on the milk ; let them boil for 
a few minutes ; repeat the operation 
with the remainder of the froth until 
all has been set, then pile it high in 
the centre of a glass dish ; make a 
custard of the yolks of the eggs, 
flavoured with vanilla, and pour it

round the snowy pyramid. It will 
maintain its place for many hours. 

Thatched Pudding. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

Two ounces of butter ; two dessert- 
spoonfuls of flour ; a little cold milk ; 
half a pint of boiling milk ; two 
lemons; four eggs; angelica; lemon 
peel — six or eight almonds. 

Melt two ounces of butter, mix 
two dessertspoonfuls of flour with a 
little cold milk, till quite smooth ; 
pour over it half a pint of boiling- 
milk, add the peel of a lemon grated, 
and sugar to taste. When cold stir 
in the yolks of four eggs well beaten, 
and add the whites whisked to a stiff 
froth, and stirred into the pudding 
the last thing before putting it into 
the mould. Wet a mould ; line it 
thickly with shreds of lemon peel 
and angelica with little bits of shred 
almonds interspersed, dipped in 
white of egg. Pour the pudding in 
very carefully, and boil it for twenty 
minutes. 

Biscuit Pudding. 

Three ounces of flour, the same of 
pounded sugar and butter, the yolks 
of three eggs, and the whites of two, 
mix all well together, having pre- 
viously warmed the butter, and beat 
the mixture for ten minutes ; put 
some thin strips of candied peel into 
some small moulds, pour in the mix- 
ture and bake for half an hour in a 
slow oven. 



Ploating Island. 

Set a quart of rich milk to boil, 
when it does so, stir into it two small 
tablespoonfuls of white sugar, and 
the beaten yolks of six eggs ; flavour 
with lemon or peach water ; whip the 
whites to a high froth ; when the 
custard is thick, put it into a deep 
china or glass dish, and heap the 
frothed eggs upon it ; it may be 
finished by putting a spoonful of 
jelly or jam over the frothed eggs. 

Broiled Lobster. 

After having boiled the lobster, 
split it from head to tail, take out 
the uneatable part called the " lady," 
lay it open, put pieces of butter over 
the meat, sprinkle it with pepper, 
and set the shells on a gridiron over 
bright coals until nicely heated 
through. Serve in the shells. 

Ice Pudding. 

Make a thin custard with a pint 
of milk and the yolks of four eggs, 
keeping out a little milk to mix with 
some currants, raisins, the crumb 
of a sponge cake, candied lemon 
and citron, grape, apricot, or any 
thing that is nice. Scald the cur- 
rants and raisins and mix them with 
the cold milk, then stir all together, 
and put it into the mould ; plunge it 
in a bucket of ice pounded with 
salt, turning the mould every two 
hours, and the inside occasionally.

COOLING SUMMER AND 
WINTER DRINKS. 



HOT 



ICE. 

Ice, once a luxury enjoyed only by the rich, has become a necessity 
of daily life. Rough ice, at id. or 2d. per lb. is used in summer for 
keeping fish good, and cooling butter in nearly all well-to-do families, and 
by thus saving our food it is really an economy. 

Ice is also most useful in many cases of illness ; in fevers, spinal affec- 
tions, etc. etc. 

Its use in cooling drinks was known from the most remote antiquity. 
The manufacture of ices was an invention of the seventeenth century. 

Ice can now be artificially produced by machinery, by evaporation, 
etc. etc., but it is seldom made at home except in wealthy households. 

The importance of being able to keep small quantities of ice for various 
purposes, and especially in sick rooms for medical use, cannot be over- 
rated. Dr. Schwarz has communicated to the public the following simple 
method, which he has practised with success. He says, " Put the ice in a 
deep dish or jug, cover it with a plate, and place the vessel on a pillow 
stuffed with feathers, and cover the top with another pillow carefully, by 
this means excluding the external air. Feathers are well-known bad con- 
ductors of heat, and in consequence the ice is preserved from melting." 
Dr. Schwarz states that he has thus preserved six pounds of ice for eight 
days. The plan is simple, and within the reach of every household. 



To Keep Ice. 

Make a double pocket of any 
kind of strong woollen cloth, no 
matter how faded and coarse it is. 
Have a space of two inches or so 
between the inner and outer pockets, 
and pack this space as full as pos- 
sible with feathers. You have no 
need to use geese feathers ; hen's 
feathers are just as good. With a 
pocket thus constructed, and kept 
closely tied at the mouth, a few 
pounds of ice may be kept a week. 

Buttermilk. 

Buttermilk is a very cooling sum- 
mer drink. It must be drunk, how- 
ever, the first day, for it is not fit for 



drinking afterwards. Sweeten with a 
little sugar, and add grated nutmeg 
to taste. 

Curds and Whey. 

Half a drachm of citric acid to a 
pint of milk. This will make good 
curds and whey. 

Lemon Tea. 

Weak green tea let get cold, and 
with half a lemon squeezed into it, 
makes an excellent beverage. 

Wine Sangaree. 

Put a gill of wine (Port or Ma- 
deira) into a tumbler, add to it water, 
hot or cold, nearly to fill it, sweeten 
with loaf-sugar to taste, grate nut- 



Barley Milk. — Barley Water, etc. etc.

meg over, and serve with sponge- 
cake or Savoy biscuit, cut small. 

Barley Milk. 

Half pound of pearl-barley, three 
pints of milk, one quart of cream, 
cinnamon and sugar to taste, one 
pint of sherry. 

Boil the pearl-barley in the milk 
till it is done ; add the cream, cinna- 
mon and sugar to taste. When 
nearly cold, pour into it a pint of 
Sherry or Marsala ; raisin wine also 
answers very well, and the cream 
may be omitted. 

Simple Barley Water. 

Two tablespoonfuls of very clean 
pearl-barley, two ounces of lump 
sugar and lemon-juice. 

Put the pearl-barley in a jug with 
the sugar required, fill it up with 
boiling water, and keep stirring for 
a few moments, cover, and let it 
stand till cold. Flavour with lemon- 
juice or cinnamon. 

Barley Water. 
The best way. 

Half a teacupful of the very best 
pearl-barley in a quart of water. 

Let the barley boil well till it is 
smooth ; then strain it off into a 
mug ; while the barley is boiling, peel 
one large lemon, or two small ones, 
as thin as possible, put the peel into 
a tumbler, pour boiling water over it. 
and cover it closely. This extracts 
all the flavour. Add the water from 
the peel, and the peel itself to the 
barley-water, with the juice of the 
lemon (strained from the pips, which 
would make it bitter) ; add loaf-sugar 
to taste. The barley-water must not 
be too thick, and before the lemon is 
added, when it is poured from the 
saucepan, it should be strained 
through muslin. 



Toast and Water. 

Fill a jug with boiling water. 
carefully drop into it a piece of bread 
toasted very brown. Let it stand till 
cold. 

If the water be poured on the toast 
instead of the toast being dropped in, 
the liquid will look cloudy and dis- 
coloured ; it ought to look as clear 
as sherry. Some persons make toast 
and water with cold water ; this is 
very nice when you are quite sure of 
the goodness of the water itself ; but 
as boiling water destroys much that 
is bad in it, we think it advisable to 
boil it first. If the water be cold, the 
toast had better approach the state 
of charcoal. But boiling water, with 
the toast, as we have said, carefully 
dropped into it, can be strained when 
it is coloured, and then poured from 
jug to jug till it is once more filled 
with carbonic acid from the air. 

Hhubarb Tea. 
Time, quarter of an hour. 

Two pounds of rhubarb-sticks, 
one lemon, sugar to taste — one quart 
of water. 

Slice the rhubarb, boil it for a 
quarter of an hour in a quart of 
water ; strain it into a jug, add the 
juice of one lemon and a little sugar 
after it is cold. 

Apple Tea. 
Time, half an hour. 

Two pounds of apples, half a 
lemon, sugar — one quart of water. 

Peel, core, and cut up the apples 
in quarters ; boil for half an hour, 
strain the liquor into a jug, squeeze 
in the juice of one lemon, and sweeten 
to taste. 

Soyer's Apple Water. 

One gallon of water, one pound of 
apples, half a pound of sugar, a slice 
of bread. 



234 



Apple, Fig, French Plum Water, etc. 



Boil the water ; while it boils cut 
up the apples in quarters. Boil them 
till they can be pulped in the boiling 
water, strain through a colander ; 
boil the strained liquor up again, with 
half a pound of white sugar — skim 
well ; slowly toast a piece of bread 
till it gets quite black, and put it in 
the apple-water — let it get cold. 
Keep it in bottles, without a cork, in 
a cool place. 

Apple Barley Water. 

One gallon of water, one pound 
of apples, quarter of a pound of pearl- 
barley, half a pound of white sugar. 

Cut up the apples, boil them till 
they will pulp in boiling water ; pass 
the liquor through a colander, add 
the sugar, then boil up again and re- 
move the scum ; boil a quarter of a 
pound of barley one hour — add it to 
the apple-water. Put it into bottles 
uncorked, and keep for use. Keep 
it in a cool place. 

Apple Water. 

Cut some tart apples very small; 
pour boiling water over them, and 
set it to simmer gently for half an 
hour, then strain off the liquor; 
sweeten to taste. 

Apple Rice Water. 

One gallon of water, one pound 
of apples, half a pound of rice, half a 
pound of lump sugar. Bake the ap- 
ples, then put them in a pan and add 
the sugar ; pour over them water in 
which the rice has been boiled to an 
utter pulp. Pass through a colander. 
To be drunk when cold. 

Mulberry Drink. 

Half a pound of mulberries, quar- 
ter of a pound of sugar, two quarts of 
cold water — a little lemon-peel. 

Bruise the mulberries, throw the 
sugar over them, and add a little 



lemon-peel. Pour in the cold water, 
stir well, allow it to settle, and strain 
off for bottling. A very delicious 
summer drink.

Quarter of a pound of preserved 
figs, two quarts of water, half an 
ounce of ginger. 

Boil the figs to a pulp, with the 
ginger ; strain off, and bottle. 

French Plum Water. 

Haifa pound of French plums, two 
quarts of water, quarter of an ounce 
of ginger, quarter of a pound of sugar.

One pound of gooseberries, one 
gallon of water, quarter of an ounce

with the sugar and ginger. Skim 
well and bottle.

One pound of red currants, half 
a pound of raspberries, half a pound 
of sugar, one gallon of cold water. 

Put in the fruit, well bruised, to- 
gether with the sugar pounded. Stir

bottling. 

Currant Water. 

Having pressed the juice from 
ripe currants, strain it clear ; put to 
each pint nearly a pound of white 
sugar pounded ; add cold water (or 
ice-water if you have it) to your 
taste ; grate in a little nutmeg, and 
it will be found a fine cooling be- 
verage. 



Capillaire and Cider Cups. 



Cherry Water. 

Pound a dozen large sour cherries 
in a mortar, so as to break the ker- 
nels, then put them into a tumbler,

Take fourteen pounds of sugar, 
break six eggs in with the shells, stir 
with it gradually three quarts of 
water, set it over the fire, and boil it, 
and take off the scum until only a 
light froth rises ; add to it a wine- 
glass of orange-flower-water, or half 
as much lemon-extract with a little 
vanilla, then strain it through a jelly- 
bag, and when cold bottle it ; cork 
it tight to keep. A wineglass of this 
put to a tumbler of ice-water is a 
cool and refreshing drink. 

A glass of wine, brandy or rum 
may be added. 

Cherry Water with Capillaire. 

Put a wineglass of capillaire 
into a tumbler ; pound a dozen large 
cherries in a mortar, so as to break

To one quart of cider add half a 
lemon squeezed, three tablespoonfuls 
of powdered lump sugar, two wine- 
glasses of pale brandy, a wineglass

on the peel and let it stand to infuse, 
covering it closely. When cold, 
strain this water from the peel into 
the juice and sugar. Put it into de- 
canters for present use. One wine-

possible, put eight of the rinds into 
three quarts of hot, not boiling, 
water, and cover it over for three or 
four hours ; rub some fine sugar on the 
other lemons to attract the essence, 
and put it into a china bowl, into 
which squeeze the juice of the lemons. 
To it add one pound and half of fine 
sugar, then put the water to the 
above, and three quarts of milk made 
boiling hot ; mix and pour through 
a jelly-bag till perfectly clear. 

Lemonade. 

Pare a number of lemons accord- 
ing to the quantity you are likely to 
want ; on the peels pour hot water, 



but more juice will be necessary than 
you need use the peels of. While 
infusing, boil sugar and water to a 
good syrup, with the white of an egg 
whipt up ; when it boils, pour a little 
cold water into it ; set it on again, 
and when it boils up, take the pan 
off, and put it to settle. If there is 
any scum, take it off, and pour it 
clear from the sediment to the water 
the peels were infused in, and the 
lemon juice ; stir and taste it, and 
add as much water as shall be neces- 
sary to make a very rich lemonade, 
then strain the liquor, which is un- 
commonly fine, through a jelly-bag. 

Lemonade that has the Flavour and 
Appearance of Jelly.

water ; boil a pound and a quarter 
of loaf sugar in three pints of water, 
and skim it ; add the two liquors to 
the juice of six China oranges, and 
twelve lemons ; stir the whole well, 
and run it through a jelly-bag till 
clear ; then add a little orange water 
if you like the flavour, and, if wanted, 
more sugar. It will keep well if 
corked. 

Lemon "Whey. 

Boil as much milk as you require ; 
squeeze a lemon, add as much of the 
juice to the milk as will make it quite 
clear. Mix with hot water and 
sweeten to taste.

divide it into twelve equal parts, and 
put each powder in white paper, if 
you like, but it is best to bottle the 
powder and keep it corked. One- 
twelfth part dissolved in a tumbler 
of water will make good lemonade. 

Soyer's Lemonade. 

Three lemons ; half a pound of 
sugar ; one gallon of water. 

Cut the lemons in very thin slices ; 
take out the pips ; put them in a 
bowl ; add the sugar ; bruise well

One ounce of citric acid ; twenty- 
two drops of essence of lemon ; one 
pound and a half of loaf sugar ; 
three-quarters of a pint of water. 

Boil the sugar in the water for a 
few minutes ; skim it ; when half 
cold mix the other ingredients with 
it. Stir well together, and bottle for 
use. Two tablespoonfuls with a 
tumbler of water makes a refreshing 
drink. 

Milk Lemonade. 

Two lemons ; two pounds of loaf 
sugar, powdered ; one quart of white 
wine ; three quarts of quite fresh 
boiling milk. 

Wash the lemons, then peel them 
very thinly ; squeeze the juice over 
the peel, and let it stand all night. 
In the morning add to it the sugar, 
powdered, the wine, and the milk 
boiling hot ; strain it once or twice 
through a jelly-bag till it is clear. 
A delicious beverage.

and delicious summer drink, and 
suitable at any time. It will be 
much approved if a pint of good 
old sherry be substituted for the

soda water or lemonade be added, 
with some grated nutmeg ; or if half 
the quantity of brandy with half a 
pint of sherry be used.

syrup to flavour it ; boil it over a 
gentle fire for a short time ; when 
cold bottle it. Mix it with water to 
your taste ; set it on ice ; serve in 
small tumblers. 

Lemon Syrup. 

Make a simple sugar syrup, add 
extract of lemon. 

Vanilla Syrup. 

Flavour simple sugar syrup with 
extract of vanilla. 

Strawberry Syrup. 

One pint of juice to one pint of 
syrup. For syrup : one pint of water 
to one pound of sugar. 

Make a syrup by boiling, in the 
proportion of one pound of sugar in 
a pint of water, skimming it till 
quite clear. Crush some fine straw- 
berries in a sieve and press out all 
their juice. To every pint of juice 
put one pint of syrup. Boil together 
gently for an hour ; then let it be- 
come cold, and bottle it. Cork and 
seal it. When used, reduce it to 
taste by adding iced water to it, or 
set it on ice and add water. 

Strawberry Sberbet. 

Fourteen ounces of picked straw- 
berries ; one quart of water ; one 
lemon ; one teaspoonful of orange- 
flower water ; eighteen ounces of 
sugar. 

Crush the strawberries in a mortar ; 
then add to them a quart of water. 
Pour this into a basin with a lemon 
sliced and a teaspoonful of orange- 
water ; let it remain for two or three 
hours. Put eighteen ounces of pow- 
dered white sugar into another basin ; 
cover it with a cloth, through which 
pour the strawberry juice ; after as 
much has run through as can, gather

up the cloth and squeeze out as 
much more as possible. When the 
sugar is all dissolved, strain it again ; 
set the bowl or jug containing it on 
ice ; until ready to serve. 

Strawberry Vinegar. 

Take the stalks from the fruit, 
which should be a highly-flavoured 
sort, quite ripe, and gathered in dry 
weather ; weigh, and put them into 
large wide-necked bottles, and to 
each pound pour about a pint and a 
half of fine, pale, white wine vine- 
gar. Tie a thick paper over them, 
and let the strawberries remain from 
three to four days ; then pour off the 
vinegar, and empty them into a jelly- 
bag, or suspend them in a cloth, that 
all the liquid may drop from them 
without pressure : take an equal 
weight of fresh fruit, pour the vine- 
gar upon it, and three days afterwards 
repeat the same process, diminishing 
a little the proportion of strawberries, 
of which the flavour ought ultimately 
to overpower the vinegar. In three 
days drain off the liquid, and, after 
having strained it through a flannel 
bag, weigh it, and mix it with an 
equal quantity of highly refined 
sugar, roughly powdered ; when this 
is nearly dissolved, stir the syrup 
over a very clear fire until it has 
boiled five minutes, and skim it 
thoroughly ; pour it into a delicately 
clean pitcher ; throw a folded cloth 
over, and let it remain until the mor- 
row ; then put it into pint or half 
pint bottles, and cork them tightly 
with new corks, not pressed in too 
tightly at first, as the bottles would 
be liable to burst. In four or five 
days they may be closely corked, and 
stored in a dry and cool place. 

A dessertspoonful to a tumbler of 
water for drinking. 

Strawberry Acid. 

Three pounds of strawberries ; 
one and a half ounces of tartaric 



acid to one pint of water; lump 
sugar. 

Put the water and the tartaric acid 
into a deep pan, let the acid dissolve, 
add the fruit. It must stand covered 
over for twenty-four hours ; then 
strain it off, and to every pint add 
one and a half pounds of loaf sugar, 
stir it well, and when the sugar is 
dissolved, bottle it, and seal it up. 
This quantity makes three bottles. 

Add a dessertspoonful to a tum- 
bler of water for drinking. 

Elackberry Syrup. 

Make a simple syrup of a pound 
of sugar to each pint of water, boil 
it until it is rich and thick, then add 
to it as many pints of the expressed 
juice of ripe blackberries as there 
are pounds of sugar ; put half a 
nutmeg grated to each quart of the 
syrup ; let it boil fifteen or twenty 
minutes, then add to it half a gill of 
fourth-proof brandy for each quart 
of syrup, set it to become cold, then 
bottle it for use. 

A tablespoon for a child, or a 
wineglass for an adult, is a dose for 
sore throat. 

Mulberry Syrup. 

Put some mulberries into a jug, 
tie a paper over it, and then put it 
up to the neck in a kettle of water, 
let it boil ; as the liquor rises from 
the mulberries, drain it off ; to each 
pint of it put one pound of white 
sugar, or brown sugar clarified ; set 
it over a slow fire, and boil until 
about the consistence of molasses, 
then skim it, and take it off; when 
cold bottle it. 

Orange Sherbet. 

Squeeze the juice from oranges, 
pour boiling water on the peel, and 
cover it closely ; boil water and sugar 
(a pint to a pound) to a syrup, skim 
it clear ; when all is cold, mix the

Put a pound of sifted loaf sugar 
to a pint of raspberry juice ; mix it 
well together, and then strain it ; to

Brown Spruce Beer. — Punch. — Milk Punch. 



245 



Brown Spruce Beer. — This beer 
is made in the same manner as the 
preceding, only treacle is substituted 
for the sugar. It is an exceedingly 
wholesome summer drink, especially 
for persons afflicted with pains of 
the kidneys. 

Punch. 

One of sour, two of sweet, four of 
strong, eight of weak, is the formula 
for making excellent punch. 

An Excellent Method of Making 
Punch. 

Take two large lemons, with 
rough skins, and some lumps of 
sugar. Rub the sugar over the lemons 
till it has absorbed all the yellow 
part of the skins ; then put into the 
bowl these lumps, and as much more 
as the juice of the lemons may re- 
quire, for no certain weight can be 
mentioned; then squeeze the lemon- 
juice upon the sugar, and with a 
bruiser press the sugar and the juice 
well together, for the richness and 
fine flavour of the punch de- 
pends on the rubbing and mixing 
process being thoroughly performed. 
Then mix this up very well with 
boiling water (soft water is best), till 
the whole is rather cool. When this 
mixture is to your taste, take brandy 
and rum in equal quantities, and put 
them to it, mixing the whole altoge- 
ther again. The quantity of liquor 
must be according to your taste ; two 
good lemons are generally enough 
to make four quarts of punch, in- 
cluding a quart of liquor, with half a 
pound of sugar ; but this depends 
on taste, and on the strength of the 
spirit. As the pulp is disagreeable 
to some people, the sherbet may be 
strained before the liquor is put in. 
Some strain the lemon before they 
put it to the sugar, which is im- 
proper ; as, when the pulp and sugar 



are well mixed together it adds to 
the richness of the punch. 

When only rum is used, about 
half a pint of porter will soften the 
punch ; and when both rum and 
brandy are used, the porter gives a 
richness and, to some, a very plea- 
sant flavour. 

Whisky Punch. 

Pour half a pint of the spirit on the 
peel of a lemon, taken off very thin, 
and the lemon cut into very thin 
slices after the whole of the white 
part has been carefully taken off. Let 
it stand one hour, then add a suffi- 
cient quantity of sugar, with a glass 
of Curacoa, about a pint of water, and 
two bottles of iced soda-water. 

George the Fourth Milk Punch. 

Time, eighteen hours. 

Take two quarts of rum, put the 
peel of twelve lemons and two 
Seville oranges into it, and let it 
stand twelve hours, then add two 
quarts of cold spring water, one 
pound of loaf sugar, one pint of 
lemon-juice, one nutmeg, one pint of 
strong green tea, quarter of a pint of 
maraschino, one pint of Madeira ; 
mix together, and stir in a pint of 
new milk boiling hot; let it stand 
six hours till quite clear ; then bottle 
it for use. 

Milk Punch. 

Infuse the peel of twelve lemons, 
cut very thin, in one quart of the 
best brandy, for forty-eight hours ; 
dissolve two pounds of treble refined 
sugar in seven pints of cold water ; 
put to it the brandy that the peel 
has been infused in, with two 
quarts more brandy and one of rum, 
with the juice of the twelve lemons 
and one grated nutmeg; then take 
three pints of milk scalding hot, and 
throw it in ; let it stand altogether

twelve hours, and then run it through 
a jelly-bag till it is clear. 

Milk Punch. 

The rinds of six lemons to stand 
in a bottle of rum three days (or 
more). Then add one quart of lemon- 
juice, three quarts of water and live 
of spirits, three pounds of loaf sugar 
and two grated nutmegs ; mix them 
all well together, and add two quarts 
of boiling milk : let all stand four or 
five hours, then fine it through a 
flannel bag, and bottle it off. 

The bottle must be filled with 
lemon-peel, cut very thin, before you 
put the spirit in. 

Cold Punch. 

Take half a pound of loaf sugar 
in lumps, rub each lump over a lemon 
to draw out the essence of the peel ; 
squeeze the lemon-juice over the 
sugar, pour over it half a pint of rum 
or whisky ; let it stand twenty mi- 
nutes, and add three pints of cold 
water and a large lump of ice. 

Cool Tankard. 

One quart of ale, one glass of 
sherry, one of brandy, one of capil- 
laire, the juice of a lemon, four ounces 
of cream of tartar. Mix and strain 
half an ounce of sugarcandy, quarter 
of an ounce of cream of tartar, a few 
lemon and orange chips. Pour upon 
them one quart of boiling water. 
When cold strain it off. 

Drink for a Sick Room. 

Put a teacupful of cranberries into 
a cup of water, and soak them. In 
the mean time boil two quarts of 
water with a large spoonful of oat- 
meal and a piece of lemon peel ; then 
add the cranberries and as much 
loaf sugar as will leave a slight 
acid flavour of the fruit, and a quar- 
ter of a pint of sherry (or less). Boil 



all for half an hour, and strain it 
off. 

Brandy Bitters. 

Steep a quarter of a pound of 
dried orange and lemon peel, and 
half an ounce of fresh peel, in one 
pint of good brandy for ten days, 
frequently shaking it ; then press 
out the liquor and filter through 
blotting paper ; lastly, dissolve two 
ounces of loaf sugar therein. This is 
a very pleasant bitter, either taken 
alone or mixed with other liquor. 

Ginger Cordial. 

To each pint of strained white 
currant juice add one quart of best 
Scotch whisky, half an ounce of 
ginger bruised, one pound of best loaf 
sugar and the rind of a lemon. Put 
it into a jar, tie it down very closely, 
and let it stand twenty-four hours. 
Then strain it through a jelly-bag, or 
filter through paper, the latter is best. 
Bottle and cork it well. In two years 
it will be in perfection. 

Imperial Water. 

Put a quarter of an ounce of cream 
of tartar and the peel of a lemon, cut 
very thin, into a jug, pour upon them

To five gallons of ripe elderberries 
put ten gallons of water, boil them 
with the water for a quarter of an 
hour, then strain them through a 
hair-sieve, not pressing the berries ; 
measure the liquor into the boiler 
again, to every gallon add three 
pounds and a half of sugar with the 
thin peels of six lemons ; let it boil 
twenty minutes ; when scalding hot 
beat up the white of four or five eggs 
and put them into it, stirring the 
liquor well about ; when the liquor is 
sufficiently cooled to add the yeast 
on the top of a piece of toasted 
bread, add the juice of six lemons ; 
when ready to be bunged up hang 
a gauze bag filled with bruised gin- 
ger in the middle of the cask. 

Ginger in proportion of half a 
pound to ten gallons of wine. 

Dandelion Wine, or Taraxacum. 

To one gallon of water put three 
quarts of dandelion blossoms, three 
pounds of raw sugar, two sweet 
oranges and two lemons. 

Pour boiling water over the flowers 
the day they are gathered, and let 
them stand all night in a tub, but do 
not cover them over. Strain the 
liquor off next morning, and boil it 
with the sugar about half an hour. 
Pare the oranges and lemons very 
thin, then take off all the white, 
bruise them well, and put them into 
the liquor with the peels when milk 
warm, with half a teacupful of yeast ; 
let it stand a week or ten days before 
putting it into the barrel. In three 
months bottle it and put two lumps 
of loaf sugar in each bottle. 

Elder Wine with Cider. 
Bake the elderberries in a large 
stone jar well stopped down ; to each 



quart of juice put three quarts of 
cider; to every gallon put two pounds 
of the best Lisbon sugar, four pounds 
of raisins stoned and chopped fine, 
two ounces of nutmegs ground, two 
ounces of cloves, two ounces of mace, 
and one ounce of cassia, all slightly 
bruised in a mortar, and two ounces 
of bitter almonds. Put all into a 
cask except the liquid which you 
must work in a tub. Put a slice of 
toasted bread and a large spoonful 
of yeast on it, let it work for one day 
and a night, then take off the scum, 
and put it also into the cask. When 
it ceases to hiss, put in half a pint of 
brandy to every gallon of liquor. If 
not made with very good strong cider, 
one pint of the best brandy will not 
be too much for each gallon. Stop 
it down close ; let it remain in the 
cask two months, then bottle it. 
The longer it is kept, the better it 
becomes. 

White Elder Wine. 

Boil eighteen pounds of white 
powdered sugar with six gallons of 
water, and two whites of eggs well 
beaten ; then skim it, and put in a 
quarter of a peck of elder-flowers 
from the tree that bears white berries. 
Do not keep them on the fire. When 
near cold, stir it, and put in six 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, four or five 
of yeast, and beat well into the liquor, 
stir it every day. Put six pounds of 
the best raisins, stoned, intothe cask, 
and tun the wine ; stop it close, 
and bottle in six months. When 
well kept this wine will pass for 
Frontignac. 

Malt Wine. 

With every three pints of water 
boil three pounds of sugar as long as 
any scum rises, which must be taken 
off, then pour it into a vessel, and 



2^0 



Parsnip, Ginger, and Raisin Wines. — Champagne. 



when sufficiently cool, add to each 
three quarts of water one quart of 
the best rum, and set it with yeast. 

Parsnip Wine. 

Take fifteen pounds of sliced pars- 
nips and boil until soft in five gallons 
of water ; squeeze the liquor well out 
of them, run it through a sieve, and 
add three pounds of coarse lump 
sugar to every gallon of liquor ; boil 
the whole for three quarters of an 
hour ; when it is nearly cold, add a 
little yeast on toast ; let it remain in 
a tub for ten days, stirring it from 
the bottom every day ; then put it 
into a cask for a year ; as it works 
over, fill it up each day. 

Ginger Wine. 

To every gallon of water add one 
pound and a half of loaf sugar and 
half an ounce of ginger finely bruised ; 
boil the whole together for one hour, 
and then pour it into a tub to cool ; 
when cool, take as many lemons as 
you have gallons of water, peel them 
very thin, and add the juice and the 
peel to the liquor ; then work it with 
a small quantity of good yeast spread 
on a piece of toasted bread ; when it 
has fermented twenty-four hours put 
the whole together into a cask, and 
at the end of six weeks bottle it, care 
being taken not to shake it, that it 
may draw off clear. After it has 
been a month in bottle, it will be fit 
for use. 

Excellent Raisin Wine. 

To every gallon of spring water 
put eight pounds of fresh smyrnas 
in' a large tub ; stir it thoroughly 
every day for a month ; then press 
the raisins in a horse-hair bag as 
dry as possible ; put the liquor into 
a cask, and when it has done hissing, 
pour in a bottle of the best brandy ; 
stop it close for twelve months, then 
rack it off; but without the dregs ; 
filter them through a bag of flannel 



of three or four folds ; add the clear 
to the quantity, and pour one or two 
quarts of brandy, according to the 
size of the vessel ; stop it up, and at 
the end of three years you may 
either bottle it or drink it fresh from 
the cask. 

Raisin wine would be extremely 
good if made rich with fruit and kept 
long, which improves the flavour 
greatly. 

Very fine Black Currant Wine. 

To every three quarts of juice, put 
the same of water unboiled ; and to 
every three quarts of the liquor add 
three pounds of veiy pure moist 
sugar ; put it into a cask, preserving 
a little for filling up ; put the cask 
in a warm dry room, and the liquor 
will ferment of itself. Skim off 
the refuse when the fermentation 
shall be over, and fill up with the 
reserved liquor. When it has ceased 
working, pour three quarts of brandy 
to forty quarts of wine. Bung it close 
for nine months, then bottle it and 
drain the thick part through a jelly- 
bag until it be clear, and bottle that. 
Keep it ten or twelve months. 

Champagne. 
To every pound or quart of grapes 
picked and bruised put one quart 
of water, let it stand in a tub three 
days, stirring it every day. To every 
gallon of juice when pressed out by 
the hands through a cloth, (and after 
standing a little time, carefully 
pour off the sediment), put three 
pounds of good loaf sugar. Barrel 
it, and put the bung slightly over ; 
when it has done working, or at the 
end of three weeks, add isinglass in 
the proportion of half an ounce to 
ten gallons of liquor, dissolving it 
previously in a small quantity of the 
liquor, stir it for three days once a 
day, and at the last stirring add one 
quart of white brandy to every five 
gallons of wine. In a few days bung 
it down close, and in six months 



Gooseberry, Orange, and Blackberry Wines. — Mead. 251 



bottle it. The fruit to be picked 
when full grown, and just beginning 
to change colour. Bottle it in March. 

Gooseberry Wine. 

Take four pounds of gooseberries 
at the time for bottling; pick and 
bruise them in a mortar ; put over 
them one gallon of water, and let it 
stand three days, stirring it three or 
four times a day, then strain it 
through a hair sieve, and to every 
gallon of liquor put three pounds of 
loaf sugar, or good fine moist ; put 
it into a cask, placing the bung 
lightly on until the fermentation 
ceases, then stop it down. It will 
be fit to bottle in six months. 

You may if you please add to every 
four gallons of liquor one quart of 
brandy. 

Gooseberry Wine. 

To a gallon of water (cold after 
being boiled) add one gallon of full 
grown gooseberries well bruised, to 
be stirred often for forty-eight hours, 
then strain off, and add three 
pounds and a half of loaf sugar ; put 
it into a cask ; when the fermenta- 
tion ceases, add a wine-glass of 
brandy ; bung it tight, and keep it 
six months before bottling. 

Orange Wine. 

Four hundred and fifty Seville 
oranges ; peel of three hundred and 
fifty ; boil fifty-six gallons of water, 
allowing three pounds of lump sugar 
to each gallon of water. When it 
boils pour it on the peels of the 
oranges ; beat up the whites and 
shells of twelve eggs to a froth ; put 
it to the liquor ; when it boils, skim 
it till clear, then pour it on your peels 
and cover it ; let it stand three or 
four days, then put it in the tub. 
After it has stood a fortnight, you 
may add two quarts of brandy, and 
stop it down. 

If you should not find liquor 
enough off the peels to fill the tub, 



put hot water on them sufficient to 
do so ; do not put the orange juice 
till you put it in the tub. A little of 
the liquor that is boiled to be put 
cold to the juice for fear of its turn- 
ing off the few days it stands. 

A Good Blackberry Wine. 

To make an excellent wine, almost 
equal to port, take ripe blackberries, 
press the juice from them, let it stand 
thirty-six hours to ferment (lightly 
covered) and skim off whatever rises 
to the top ; then, to every gallon of 
the juice, add one quart of water and 
three pounds of sugar (brown will 
do) ; let it stand in an open vessel 
for twenty-four hours ; skim and 
strain it, then barrel it. Let it stand 
eight or nine months, when it should 
be racked off, and bottled and corked 
close. Age improves it. 

Mead. 

To a gallon of water put four pounds 
of honey; boil it three-quarters of 
an hour ; skim it. Add one ounce of 
hops ; boil it half an hour, and let it 
stand till next day ; put the quantity 
made into your cask; to thirteen 
gallons of the liquor add a quart of 
brandy. Lightly stop it till the fer- 
mentation is over, then stop^ it very 
close. Keep it a year in cask. 
Cowslip Mead. 

Put thirty pounds of honey into 
fifteen gallons of water, and boil till 
one gallon is wasted ; skim it, and 
have ready a dozen and a half of 
lemons cut in quarters ; pour a gallon 
of the liquor boiling hot over them ; 
put the remainder into a tub with 
eight pecks of cowslip-pips ; let them 
stay all night ; then put the liquor 
and the lemons to eight spoonfuls of 
new yeast, and a handful of sweet- 
brier ; stir altogether ; let it work 
three or four days ; strain it ; put 
it into the cask. Let it stand six 
months. Then bottle it.

Wines are prepared by the dried fermentation of the sugar which 
exists in the juices of fruits. The wines of Europe are mostly made 
from the juice of the grape, which before fermentation is called " must." 
Wines vary according to the quantities of sugar, alcohol, and acid they 
contain. When wines contain much sugar they are called " sweet," when 
little " dry." The quantity of alcohol depends on the amount of sugar 
changed during fermentation. It is frequently added to wines to give 
them strength, as in port, sherry, and Madeira. Clarets, hocks, and the 
light wines of the Continent will not bear the addition of alcohol. The 
acid in wines made from grapes is tartaric. It forms an insoluble salt with 
potash, which is the tartar of the lees of wine, and thus wine is freed 
from too much acidity. The colour of red wines depends on a very small 
quantity of colouring matter contained in the grape. The market value 
of wines depends to a great extent on the development of a variety of 
chemical compounds, which are formed during their fermentation and 
keeping. These form the "bouquet" and peculiar flavour of wines. Some 
of these compounds, as cenanthic ether, occur in all wines. Others, as

Foreign Wines. 253 



acetic, butyric, caprylic ethers, and oxide of amyl, are only found in old 
wines ; whilst some are peculiar to the wines of particular districts, as the 
flavouring principle of the muscatel grape.* 

The vine is one of the most useful of vegetable productions. In 
Switzerland the leaves are used as a remedy for cuts and wounds. Our 
cooks use them for covering the breast of the grouse when roasting. 
They also make a good tea, which is said to strengthen the nerves. The 
prunings yield vinegar. The leaves are also good food for cows and sheep ; 
but are too rare in England to be thus used, and in the vine countries they 
are used for manuring the vineyard itself. Vine branches yield potash 
and salt when burned. The Germans distil brandy from the skins or 
" musk," and extract an oil from the seeds. 

For making wine the grapes are gathered when fully ripe. For the 
best wine the best grapes are selected ; the stems are pressed with them, 
as they are thought to make the wine keep better. For red wine the 
grapes are picked off the clusters by the hand. Formerly, and still in one 
or two of the Greek islands, at St. Lucar, and in some parts of France 
the grapes are trodden as in the days of Isaiah ; but now in a general 
way mechanical presses, or two wooden cylinders turning in opposite 
directions, press out the juice of the grape. 

_ The juice is then put into vats and left to ferment. The saccharine 
principle of the grape and the tartaric acid cause the fermentation, which 
is rendered active by heat, and delayed by cold. In the dry wines there 
is a good proportion of tartaric acid ; in the sweet wines the quantity is 
inferior to the grape-sugar ; this difference causes the wine to be either 
" dry," as it is called, or " sweet." 

When the wine is sufficiently fermented, it is drawn off into barrels. 
But as the process of wine making, interesting as it is, is of no service to 
the British householder, we will not enter into useless details, but proceed 
to enumerate the names and properties of the wines with which he should 
fill his cellars. And first we must premise that first-rate wine can never 
be obtained cheaply; and all assertions of such being the case are 
delusions and snares. The purchaser should buy of thoroughly respec- 
table wine merchants, not of publicans or grocers ; and the better the 
character of the firm is, the surer he may be of obtaining a pure and 
wholesome wine. 

Port 

stands at the head of the above table, and has long been held in general 
esteem by Englishmen, but it is well known that there is no wine more 
easily imitated or adulterated ; cheap port is therefore to be eschewed. Ac- 
cording to Mr. Cyrus Redding (to whose admirable and amusing volume 
" On Wines " we recommend the reader), port or Oporto has long been so 
grievously brandied, coloured with elderberries, &c, in Portugal itself, 
that it never is (or only by accident) a pure wine. The taste for it was 
first introduced into England by a sense of economy. Portugal undertook 
to import our woollens if her port wine was taken at a lower duty than 
the wines of France. The treaty respecting it, called the Methuen Treaty, 



* From South Kensington Food Catalogue. 



254 Mas dm — Sherry. 



was signed in 1703. At first the wine was supplied tolerably pure, but as 
it became an established favourite in England it was gradually more and 
more brandied and adulterated, and thus the English taste gradually 
acquired a relish for hot fruity wine, which it has not yet lost. 

Mr. Henderson, a great authority on the subject of wines, says of port 
or Oporto, " The wines of Oporto, which abound in the astringent princi- 
ple, and derive additional potency from the brandy added to them pre- 
viously to exportation (especially those intended for the British market) 
may be serviceable in disorders of the alimentary canal, where gentle 
tonics are required. But the gallic acid renders them unfit for weak 
stomachs, and what astringent virtues they show will be found in greater 
proportion in the wines of Alicant and Rota, which contain more tannin 
and less acid. The excitement they produce is of a more sluggish nature 
than that attending the use of the purer French wines, and does not en- 
liven the fancy in the same degree. As a frequent beverage they are 
unquestionably more pernicious." 

For persons unable to purchase port wine at a good price from a first- 
rate wine merchant, Roussillon is an excellent substitute, and according 
to Mr. Redding has been frequently sold for port. It contains only 18*13 °f 
alcohol, port 23*39, consequently it is not so heating or intoxicating, and 
it is considerably cheaper than good port. It is a wine of the Pyrenees 
Orientales. 

■■ The red wines of Roussillon are remarkable for their fine deep colour 
and alcohol. They have the advantage also of not spoiling when left in 
a partially filled cask. They ameliorate by age. They deposit continually, 
and form a crust on the bottle." — Redding on Wines. 

Masdeu 

is an excellent Roussillon wine ; it is strong in body, deep in colour, and of 
rich soft taste. 

Sherry 

is either brown or pale. 

Amontillado, a dry delicate sherry, is from Andalusia. It is excel- 
lent and is supposed to be the " sack " of Shakspeare. 

All sherry is by nature of a pale colour, the darker shades are conferred 
by age, or by vino de color, or by boiled wine. This is made by taking 
some of the must before fermentation begins and boiling it down to a 
sixth of the quantity, keeping it constantly stirred and skimmed from all 
impurities. When the liquor is quite thick the fire underneath it is with- 
drawn gradually and it is let get cool. This boiled wine is mixed in the 
proportion of a quarter or less quantity with the pale sherry, and thus 
makes it of different kinds of brown shades, consequently brown sherry 
is sweeter than the dry wines. 

The pale sherry is the pure wine, to which is added two bottles of 
brandy to the butt. 

Manzanilla 

is a delicate pure wine of a fine straw colour. The name is the Spanish 
for chamomile, and the flavour of the wine probably suggested the name, 



Foreign Wines. 255 



as there is a chamomile taste in Manzanilla. " This wine," says Mr. 
Redding, " is the driest of all the Spanish wines, scarcely any wine what* 
ever surpassing its delicacy and purity. It admits of no mixture of any 
kind, not even the smallest quantity of brandy, without deterioration in 
taste and flavour. When carefully made it becomes a perfect wine, 
and improves with age beyond all other kinds both in flavour and firm- 
ness, so as to surpass almost every dry wine." Sherries are not to be 
judged by colour but by taste. They are subject to adulteration and 
cannot be bought pure and good under a good price. Pure sherry being 
totally without acidity is considered the most wholesome of wines. A 
good age is required to mellow the Spanish wines. 

For those who are unable to afford good sherry, Marsala is an excel- 
lent substitute, and is generally very pure. It resembles Madeira of the 
second class. "A voyage to India and home renders this wine, when of 
the best quality, a most excellent dinner wine, equal to Madeira."* 

Now as the advantages to Madeira of an Eastern voyage are motion 
and heat, why could not both be contrived for the Marsala without the 
voyage, by giving it motion by some mechanical means, in a place where 
the temperature is kept high ? Marsala is the strongest of wines ; it has 
25*09 per cent, o'f alcohol. 

Madeira, 

Though this wine is no longer as fashionable as it once was, it is still 
considered a very choice and excellent wine. It requires age, and is 
better for an East Indian voyage. Its flavour and aroma perfect them- 
selves by years, and it stands all climates. 

Madeira should never be bought cheaply, as it cannot be sold at alow 
price if genuine, and there are many imitations of it from the rejected 
wines of the south of the island. "Of all the strong wines," says Mr. 
Henderson, " those of Madeira, when of good quality, seem best adapted 
to invalids ; being equally spirituous as sherry, but possessing a more 
delicate flavour and aroma, and though often slightly acidulous, agreeing 
better with dyspeptic habits." Madeira is next to port in amount of 
alcohol. 

Malmsey Madeira is a first-class wine of great excellence. It has 
not so much alcohol as Madeira, only about i6'4oper cent. 

Claret, 

becoming now a universal beverage, is a French wine of the Bordelais. 
The name claret comes (Mr. Redding tells us) from Clairet j the wine is 
" a mixture of several sorts of wine, Beni-Castro and Bordeaux are thus 
mingled up for the English market; Sometimes Languedoc and Bor- 
deaux, at others Hermitage and Alicant with Bordeaux, and uniformly 
a portion of spirits of wine in addition." 

Claret was one of the favourite wines of our ancestors, and is exceed- 
ingly excellent when good, but the sour vi?i ordinaire sold for it at low 
rates is about as nasty as it can be. But those weak clarets midl well in

256 Burgundy — Hocks. 



winter, and are good enough for ordinary claret-cup in summer when in 
both cases sugar is added. But the householder who lays down a good 
cellar should give the best price for claret. 

Chateau Livran is a good wine ; St. Julien of St. Estephe is nourish- 
ing, with great body ; Chateau Belaire ranks next to Chateau Margaux. 
Of ordinary clarets St. Emilion is a good cheap wine. Chateau 
Lafitte is a wine quite unsurpassed in excellence. Chateau Latour has 
greater body and consistence than Chateau Lafitte ; it requires to be kept 
a year longer in wood than Lafitte to attain maturity. 

Chateau Margaux has a rich colour and a soft bouquet, and strength 
without headiness. 

The best Medoc wines are Chateau Margaux, Chateau Lafitte, 
Chateau Latour. These wines are of fine colour and perfume, less warm 
than Burgundy, with a taste of the violet, and a rich purple hue. 

The Bordeaux white wines are Chateau d'Yquem, Haut Sauterne, 
Sauterne, and Vin de Graves. These wines vary in excellence and in price. 
The first-named are excellent light wines. 

Burgundy. 

The red wines of Bungundy are distinguished by great spirituosity 
and a powerful aroma. Owing perhaps to this aroma they are more 
heating than many stronger wines. They are pleasant, healthful, and in- 
vigorating. The best Burgundies are Romanee-Conti, Chambertin, red 
and white, St. Georges, Clos Vougeot ; and for cheaper wines Beaune, 
Beaujolais, and Macon. The finest white Burgundy is Montrachet. 
Chablis is an excellent light wine. 

Chambertin is white and red. " It is a wine of great fulness, keeps 
well, and has the aroma perfect. It was the favourite wine of Napoleon." 
— Reddi?ig on Wines. 

The Romanee-Conti is considered the most perfect wine in Burgundy. 
St. Georges is an exquisite wine. Montrachet is a delicious white wine, 
considered the best white wine in Burgundy ; it has an exquisite perfume. 
Burgundy is always sent to England in bottles, and is said to deteriorate 
even on the short voyage across the Channel. Chablis is a pleasant dry 
wine. There are very good second-class Burgundies, of lower price than 
the fine wines above named. These are Vosne, Nuits, Volnay, Beaune, 
and Pommard, &c. 

The wines of the Rhone must find their place in a well-furnished 
cellar. Of these 

Hermitage is full of body, spirit, and perfume. The white is the 
finest of white wines. Red Hermitage is of good body and has a rasp- 
berry flavour. The second growth of red Hermitage (less expensive) is 
also a very good wine. 

Frontignac is a fine spirituous luscious wine — a muscadine wine. 
Frontignac is white, sweet, and of moderate price. 

We come now to the light and most excellent wines of the Rhine. 

Hocks. 

From the town of Hochheim on the Marne the name Hock is derived ; 
and is too generally applied to all German wines by us. The Hoch- 



Foreign Wines. 257 



heimer made near this town is very excellent, but the best wine is the 
Schloss-Johannesberger, made on Prince Metternich's estate. The 
" Steinberger " is sometimes said to rival the Johannesberger however. 

Marcobrunner is another excellent Rhine wine. Rudesheimer and 
Niersteiner are delicate and free from acidity. 

There are numerous Hocks of an inferior quality sold in England, 
varying in price from iSs. to 54^., or even higher. 

Moselle, 

The Moselle wines are light and secondary to those of the Rhine and 
Marne. Moselle wines have lately become favourites with us. They will 
not keep as long as Rhine wine, but are very pleasant and wholesome. 
These light wines "are more refrigerant," says Mr. Henderson, "than 
any others, and are excellent for persons in low fevers, and when there is 
great nervous exhaustion." 

The German wines are imported in bottles, generally in cases con- 
taining three dozen each. 

Champagne, 

"Champagne," says Mr. Redding, in his interesting book, "reached 
its present perfection and estimation in 16 10, at the coronation of 
Louis XIII. The oldest anecdote which the French possess relative to 
the excellence of Rheims wine dates as far back as 1397, when Vinceslaus, 
King of Bohemia and of the Romans, on coming to France to negotiate 
a treaty with Charles VI., arrived at Rheims, and hav.ng tasted the wine 
of Champagne — it is to be presumed for the first time — spun out his 
diplomatic errand to the longest possible moment, and then gave up all 
that was required of him in order to prolong his stay, getting drunk on 
Champagne daily before dinner. It is said that Francis I. of France, 
Pope Leo X., Charles V. of Spain, and Henry VIII. of England had each 
of them a vineyard at Ay, their own property, and on each vineyard a 
small house occupied by a superintendent. Thus the genuine article was 
secured by each sovereign for his own table." 

The vineyards on the banks of the Marne produce the best Cham- 
pagne. 

Champagne is divided into sparkling or mousseux, demi-sparkling 
{ere mans or demi-mousseux), and still Champagne or non-moiisseux. 
They are white, straw-coloured, grey, rosy, or red. 

Still Champagne is infinitely the best, though not generally preferred 
in England. 

Sillery has no sparkle at all. The wine which froths only slightly 
is the best. 

Ice improves Champagne by diminishing its effervescence. The 
Champagne which effervesces violently is not the best wine. The best 
Champagnes are : Sillery (still and dry), Ay (fine effervescing wine, bright 
in colour), Hautvilliers, Dizy, Epernay " Closet." These are white 
Champagnes. The Hautvilliers, Dizy, Marenil, and Epernay Closet, 
which are red Champagnes, are third-class wines. 

The use of Champagne for invalids cannot be extolled sufficiently. 

s 



258 Champagne. 



The writer has seen cases where its administration has been apparently 
life-giving. It acts so quickly on the circulation, raises the depressed 
spirits so & gently, and exhilarates without causing any after-reaction, that 
it cannot be praised enough as a curative agent. 

New Champagne glasses, which by means of a hollow stem keep up 
the effervescence, have been invented for some years, but we prefer the 
old-fashioned glasses. Rhine wines and Moselle should be drunk out of 
the thinnest glass it is possible to procure. The glasses sold for Hock 
are green. 

The wines of Champagne, whether still or effervescing, are generally 
in perfection the third year of bottling ; but the best wines gain, rather 
than lose in delicacy by keeping, up to ten or twenty years. 

Though good Champagne is so excellent its imitations or any species 
of bad Champagne are very deleterious. 

English gooseberry wine is a pleasant effervescent wine, but altogether 
lacks the aromal bouquet of Champagne. 

Amongst rarer wines in the English cellar should be Tokay, a Hun- 
garian wine, thick, rich, and expensive ; Constantia, from Cape of Good 
Hope, a luscious wine ; Lachrymae Christi, a Neapolitan wine, a rich 
sweet luscious red wine. 

Mountain or old Malaga is little drunk now. It is a rich sweet 
wine. 

The Hungarian wines have recently come into the English market 
with some success. There is a Hungarian Chablis sold very cheap, 
but we have no personal knowledge of it, and the red wines are said to be 
pleasant and good. 

The Greek wines also have taken their place in England, and are 
said to be very good. 

Of these the wines of Cyprus were once well-known in England. 
Cyprus of the Commandery is still valued. The age of Cyprus wine may 
be known by pouring it into a glass and observing whether oily particles 
adhere to the sides. It is often adulterated with sweet wines and per- 
fume.. Cold injures it ; it should be placed before the fire in winter 
before drinking. Kephisia, when red, resembles claret rather, and is a 
good wine. 

While Kephisia is a pleasant dry wine, Patras, when red, approaches 
the character of Burgundy. 

Mont Hymet is also a pleasant wine. 

The purchaser should taste these wines and judge for himself, how- 
ever, as in these matters personal taste can alone decide. 

The Spanish Catalan, red and white, is considered a good wine when 
it can be had pure, and is used in some of the hospitals. It is a spirituous 
red wine, warm and fruity. It is very cheap, and Kinloch's is, we believe, 
considered the be3t. These wines are infinitely preferable to the old 
cheap Cape wine, of which one now hears very little. 

The Cape wines, except Constantia, are of a very inferior quality and 
now seldom purchased. Lisbon and Bucellas, once favourite wines, are 
now out of fashion. 

Australia has sent us " Adelaide " wine ; but as yet it is not in much 
vogue. 



The Wine Cellar. 259 



The tables of the higher classes have long been served with the light 
wines of France and the Rhine, port being seldom taken (except with 
cheese) or with the dessert, or on account of its known age and 
purity. 



THE WINE CELLAR. 

The wine cellar should if possible face north, and be divided in two 
portions, as some wines, such as Madeira, Sherry, Malaga, and Cyprus, keep 
better at a higher temperature than the light wines require. " The wines 
of Champagne, Bordeaux, and the Rhone should be kept in cellars where 
no motion can affect them, far from the vibration or rather trembling of 
the earth from the traffic over granite pavements; they should be as far 
removed from sewers and the air of courts where trades of a bad odour 
are carried on, as possible." 

Bad smells affect wine. Vinegar must never be kept in a wine cellar, 
and the temperature should be maintained the same all the year round, 
by a thermometer ; for wine is influenced by heat and cold, by frequent 
moving and shaking. The temperature of the cellar should be between 
46° and 56 Fahrenheit. 

Greek and Hungarian wines require a temperature of 66° Fahrenheit.* 

Sparkling wines should be kept in the very coolest part of the cellar, 
cork downwards. All other kinds should be laid down horizontally, that 
the cork may be kept moist and the air thus excluded ; but the rich wines 
of liqueur, as Malaga, Syracuse, &c, may be placed on their ends. 

Wines differ considerably as to the time of keeping. They lose their 
bouquet by being kept too long. There is always a middle period when 
they are best used. 

Burgundy will be good for twenty years, but it does not improve after 
fourteen. Good Champagne improves for fifteen years, and will keep 
forty years, but is best at twelve years old. 

Roussillon will keep for any length of time. The luscious wines im- 
prove by keeping, as do port and sherry. Effervescing wines require to 
be bottled early. Delicate and light wines should remain unbottled as 
long as possible, for in that state they improve most. Strong-bodied 
wines, on the contrary, should remain long in bottle. When any wine 
ceases to deposit it begins to deteriorate. 

Great care should be taken in bottling delicate wines. 

Mr. Redding tells us that on the Continent a plan is adopted which 
enables the wine to be drawn off slowly (even as required for drinking) 
without injuring the wine by the inevitable admission of air. A bottle of 
the purest olive oil is poured on the wine. It floats of course at the top, 
and excludes the air from the partly emptied cask, so that the quality of 
the wine will be preserved for a yearns duration. 

Wine in casks should be firmly laid up, and bottled only in fine weather. 



Artificial heat may be introduced into a cellar by means of a chafing-dish, 

S 2 



260 Decanting. 



The bottles should be cleansed and rinsed twenty-four hours before 
they are filled. 

Shot should never be used to cleanse wine bottles, as if any of them get 
jammed in, the acid of the wine will act on them. Clean gravel is much 
the best. After washing, the bottles should be well drained, being placed 
with their necks downwards. Afterwards they should be rinsed with a 
little brandy, if the wine is not of the first class. Very fine wine would 
be spoiled by the brandy. 

The corks should be selected with care ; they must be sound, not 
specked with black, well cut, and quite new, or they will give a bad taste 
to the wine. The corks are improved by steeping them in hot water. A 
wooden mallet, a bottling boot, and a squeezer will be required. The 
corking boot is buckled by a strap to the knee, the bottle placed in it, and 
the cork after being squeezed in the press is driven into the bottle. But 
we are going a little too fast. The wine has to be bottled first. 

Place the bottle and filterer in a tub by the cask, bore a hole in the 
lower part of the cask with a gimlet, and receive the wine in the bottle. 
Two persons should bottle the wine. The bottle, when as full as required, 
should be passed to the person who corks, who does it as above described. 
As the wine draws near the bottom of the cask a thick piece of muslin is 
placed in the strainer to receive the sediment. Bottles should have the 
corks covered with a composition of resin, Burgundy pitch, and yellow 
wax, with a little red mastic. This is melted over the fire till it froths, 
then stirred and replaced till it has well combined ; with this mixture the 
corks should be wholly covered. 

The wine when bottled must be stored away in its respective bins, 
and covered with a layer of sawdust. The rows of bottles are separated 
by a lath, and the necks laid alternately in opposite directions, the necks 
of the second row being placed towards the bottoms of the first. Wine so 
laid in will be ready for use according to its age. Old port wine will be 
ready to drink after it has been bottled about six months. 

Good sherry will be fit to drink as soon as the " sickness," as it is 
called, ceases. 

For fining wine the following receipt is a good one. Draw a gallon 
and a half of the wine, whisk into one quart of it the whites of five eggs, 
with a whisk. When it is thoroughly mixed, pour it into the cask by the 
bunghole and stir it up with a long thin stick ; then pour in the rest of 
the gallon ; stir again and skim off the bubbles which follow. Close the 
bunghole and let it stand for three or four days, or isinglass may be used ; 
one ounce is sufficient to clear ioo gallons of wine. 

Decanting. 

Port wine should be decanted very carefully into a warm decanter, 
keeping the chalked side of the bottle uppermost, so as not to disturb the 
crust or sediment. Sherry should be decanted two hours before it is used ; 
as should all the Greek white wines. 

Greek and Hungarian red wines should only be decanted just before 
using. The same may be said of the French red wines. 

The deposit which exists in all wine (though in some it is scarcely 



Distilled Spirits. 261 



perceptible) consists in port, of tartar and tannin, which, uniting with the 
albuminous matter in it, forms a crust, which becomes year by year so 
thin that it has obtained the name of beeswing. 

The deposit from white wine is chiefly tartar, in the form of crystals. 

Wines are made in this country from oranges, raisins, gooseberries, 
currants, elderberries, and other fruits. They contain other acids besides 
tartaric, which are not thrown down as insoluble salts ; hence the neces- 
sity of adding to them large quantities of sugar, to cover the taste of the 
acid. The sugar in this case is in a readily fermentible condition, hence 
these wines cannot be taken in large quantities with the same impunity 
as wines holding less sugar in solution. 

It is better, if possible, to buy foreign wines in the wood, and bottle 
them at home, but this is not always practicable. 

Half-pint bottles are not economical and not requisite, and even a 
bottle of Champagne may be kept partly full after opening, by corking 
tightly with a silver-stoppered cork and turning the neck downwards.

Distillation was invented by the Arabs, and was introduced into 
Europe by them A.D. 900. But it was not in general use, the 
chemist and alchemist alone practising it, till the seventeenth century, 
when the art was fully established in France. 

The " still " became then very common in England, and in all great 
country houses the lady had her still-room and her " still-room maid" 
(who, by the by, retains the same name, though the still-room in the old 
sense exists no longer), and here the housemother of Queen Anne's days, 
and long after, distilled rose and lavender water ; and "cordial waters," 
with which she dosed her family. 

When wines or other fermented liquors are submitted to heat, the 
alcohol distils over and may be collected in a receiver. The product is 
called distilled spirits. The alcohol is not, however, pure, but mixed with 
water. It is difficult to procure alcohol pure. A spirit having a density 
of "825, is called proof spirit in this country ; and when distilled spirits 
contain more or less alcohol than this they are said to be under or above 
proof. 

Brandy is distilled from wine, cider, perry, corn, potatoes, prunes, 
and cherries. 

The brandy which first passes condensed from the still is weak and is 
always thrown back again ; then follows the purest product ; the best 
brandy. As the distillation proceeds the brandy becomes weaker. The 



262 Distilled Spirits. 

Eau de vie premiere, the best, is the only brandy exported from France. 
Brandy of inferior quality is distilled from garden fruits, honey, molasses, 
corn, potatoes, &c. 

The peculiar flavour of brandy depends on the addition of peach 
kernels to the liquid while distilling. It also contains cenanthic and acetic 
ethers. 

Spanish Brandy ranks next in quality to French brandy. French 
Brandy is called Cognac from the chief place of its manufactory. 

Gin is obtained from fermented grain, to which the berries of the 
juniper are added to give it a flavour. Other flavouring substances are 
employed, as cinnamon, cloves, &c, for what is called " cordial gin." 
The words gin and Geneva are a corruption of Genievre, French for 
juniper. 

Gin is not allowed to be sold pure by the distiller, because for the con- 
venience of the excise it must be distilled only in a certain mode and 
strength above proof. The distiller is compelled to send his product to a 
person called a rectifier, who reduces and adulterates it at his pleasure. 

The worst possible adulterations are practised on English gin, and it 
is consequently the worst spirit to drink. Unhappily it is chiefly the poor 
who suffer from this wrong. The com spirit of the Scotch and Irish is 
suffered to be purely distilled. Whisky is therefore less injurious than 
gin. It has a slightly smoky flavour. 

Rum is distilled, from fermented sugar and molasses, in the West 
Indies. Its peculiar odour depends on butyric ether, and a flavour is 
sometimes given to it by the addition of pineapples. 

_ Rum is a wholesome spirit ; chiefly drunk in the navy by the seamen. 
It is very nourishing, and is often given with milk to invalids ; a table- 
spoonful to a tumbler of milk. Rum should be kept a long time. 

Hollands is a gin from Schiedam. 

Arrack is obtained from fermented rice, betel-nuts, or the sap of 
the various species of palm. 

Potato Brandy is made by converting the starch of the potato into 
glucose, and then fermenting and distilling it. 

Liqueurs are spirits distilled from various substances which give 
their peculiar flavour, and to which a considerable quantity of sugar is 
added. 

Maraschino de Zara is a liquor distilled from the cherry. 

Goldwasser or Eau de Vie de Dantsic is distilled from com 
and has gold leaf floating on it. 

Rosolio is made from brandy, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves distilled. 

Shrub is a liquor made from rum — now seldom seen.

Ale 

has been for centuries the national beverage of the English. _ The 
" mead" of the Saxons appears to have early merged into it, as it is men- 
tioned by Chaucer ; and in his time, and afterwards, its praises were sung 
in popular songs and Christmas choruses. But the " good ale " of Bishop 
Still's famous song was not the ale of to-day. It was made of malt 
it is true, and resembled our ale in being an alcoholic liquor ; but to the 
malt, umnalted oats were added, and the bitter flavour was given by the 
addition of ivy-berries, or bay-berries. An attempt was made in 1428 to 
flavour ale with hops, but the people, always averse to novelty, petitioned 
Parliament against it as a "wicked weed," and the use of them was 
deferred till 1528, when, as the old rhyme tells us — 

" , Reformation, and beer,* 

Came into England in the same year." 

It appears likely that hops were not indigenous to Britain, but were intro- 
duced from the Hanse Towns, where they were used for the beer which 
formed one of the staple exports of those boroughs in the thirteenth 
century.

264 



THE BREWERY. 

The brewery, when possible, should be a separate apartment, as 
nothing is worse for the beer than to allow the place in which it is made 
to be used for washing, &c. 

Any place well-covered in and ventilated will do for a brewhouse, but 
the bottom should be paved with brick or stone, that it may always be 
well cleansed. Bad smells in the neighbourhood will spoil the beer, for 
the proper making of which pure air and soft water are most essential. 

Proper Management of Vessels for Brewing. 

The utensils for brewing should never be used for any other purpose 
except perhaps for home-made wines, and when so used should be most 
carefully cleansed. They should be kept in a very clean place. 

The casks should be cleaned before using with boiling water, the 
heads taken out, and the inside scrubbed with sand and fuller's earth. 
When this is done the head is to be put on again, and the cask scalded 
well ; then a piece of unslacked lime should be thrown into it, and the 
bung stopped close. When the casks have stood thus for some 
time, they must be rinsed well with cold water, they will then be fit for 
use. 

The greatest attention must be paid to the coolers, for if they are not 
quite pure and sweet they will communicate a most unpleasant taste to 
the home-brewed. Our readers may have occasionally detected in it a 
flavour like snuff ; this proceeds from coolers which have contracted a 
mustiness or smell, which no Washing will remove, when wet has long 
lodged in the wood of the cooler. When the coolers are being pre- 
pared, the water used for cleaning should never be suffered to stand too 
long in them, or it will soak in and produce this taint — for this reason it 
is better to have coolers lined with lead ; they are very clean, and expedite 
the cooling of the liquor, thus saving a good deal of waste of the liquor by 
evaporation. 

If the coolers are of wood, it is best to scrub them well over with cold 
water ; hot water, old housekeepers say, is more likely to develop the evil 
taint. 

The mash tub also must be kept perfectly clean ; nor must the grains 
be left in the tub longer than the day after brewing, lest they should sour 
it. A sour scent in the brewhouse will be likely to infect the liquor and 
worts. 

The brewhouse floor shouiu be washed down, so as to insure cleanli- 
ness. 



265 



BREWING UTENSILS. 

Every brewhouse, large or small, must have its plant or proper 
utensils ; these are — 

1. The copper for the liquor or wort, or when possible two coppers 
are better, one for the water and one for the wort. 




Brewing Copper. 

2. The mash tub, which is a tub with a false bottom some inches 
above the true bottom. It is bored full of small holes through which the

wort is drained from the malt. These holes must be examined occa- 
sionally to see that they do not get choked up. If they are, a skewer 
should be made hot and they should be repierced with it. 

For home use a wine butt cut down, with a false bottom put in it, 
answers every purpose. 

3. The oar or rudder, anciently called the Pcnstoff, for stirring up the 
malt in the mash tub.

4. The undcrback — that is, a tub to receive the wort as it comes out of

the mash tub. The upper part of the cut-down wine butt would answer 
for it. 

5. The Coolers. — These are oblong shallow vessels. They should^ be 
raised at one end to allow the wort to run off free of the sediment.

6. The Fermenting tun ; it should be large enough to hold the whole 
brewing ; but the mash tub, with the false bottom taken out, can be used.

And we may observe here, that the grains taken out are of great use for 
feeding cows and pigs. 

7. Casks and oak-stands to place them on. As to size and number, 
they will depend on the quantity required. 

8. Stillions — *.*., flat wooden troughs in which the vats or barrels 
stand while the yeast is coming over.

15. A tub and skimmer for the yeast.

Materials used in Brewing. 

The materials required for brewing pure beer are Malt, Hops, Yeast, 
and water and isinglass for fining — (this is dissolve \ in sour beer). 

Malt is made from barley, wheat, oats, or rye ; but barley is the best, 
and is used for English beer. 

Malting, or making malt, is performed by putting the barley in a 
cistern, steeping it in water till the grains become swollen and soft, 
and then piling it in a heap, to develop heat by the absorption of oxygen 
from the air. After this the grain is spread about on the floor, more or 
less, according to the temperature of the air. It soon begins to sprout, 
and throws out a rootlet and germ, when the peculiar chemical substance 
called diastase is developed, which has the singular power of converting 
starch first into dextrin, and afterwards into grape-sugar. In fourteen 
days the barley will have sprouted sufficiently ; its starch being to a great 
extent converted into sugar. It is then dried in a kiln, and is in a fit state 
to use for brewing. 

There are four sorts of malt ; made by varying the amount of heat 
employed in drying it. These kinds are called pale, amber, brown, and 
blown. 

The pale malt contains the largest amount of saccharine matter, and 
consequently makes the best and strongest beer. 

Amber malt is only slightly scorched, and has therefore nearly as 
much sugar in it as the pale ; in brown malt the scorching has greatly 
diminished the amount of sugar ; in the black or blown, the sugar has 
been by heat converted' nto caramel, which has a bitter taste. 

In choosing malt it is best to buy that which has the grains full, 
round and plump, with a thin skin, and with a mellow sweet taste. In 
testing it draw a broken grain across a board ; if it leaves a rich chalk 
mark it is good — or put some in water ; good malt always swims ; if there 
is raw barley mixed with it, it will sink. Maltsters sometimes adulterate 
their malt with raw barley, but it will never float as good malt does. Malt 
should weigh from 40 to 45 lbs. per bushel. If it is light it is not so good, 
or pure. 

It is best to grind the malt at home, as it measures more when ground 



Hops — Water 2 69 



than it does in the grain. It should not be ground too fine, and it should 
be crushed or ground nearly a week (or if high dried or dark malt, ten 
days or a fortnight) before using — that it may mellow. 

The pale malt is the most wholesome. Beer made of brown malt turns 
sour sooner than the pale does. 

Hops. 

The hop or Humulus Lupitlus, is a plant now extensively cul- 
tivated in England. Our hop gardens form a portion of the national 
wealth, and far excel in picturesque beauty the vineyards of France 
and Spain. Hops are cultivated chiefly in Kent, Sussex, Worcester- 
shire, and Herefordshire ; also in Belgium and the United States. 
They require a rich and loamy soil, and great quantities of manure. 
They need the greatest care, and are always an uncertain crop. In 
unfavourable seasons they are imported. 

The hops from South and Mid-Kent are the strongest and most highly 
flavoured. Herefordshire and Worcestershire hops, of a more delicate 
flavour, are used chiefly for pale ale. Belgium hops are used for porter. 
" Spent hops" — i.e., those which have been boiled in the wort, are used for 
manure. 

Hops are gathered by hand in September and the first week of 
October, and are rapidly kiln-dried. After which they are put into 
pockets, or bags, where they become a solid greenish-yellow mass. The 
active principle of the hop resides in a bitter resinous matter called 
lupulin, and also in an essential oil, both of which prevent beer from 
decomposing. 

Hops retain their strength up to three or four years old, after which 
they are worthless ; but the fresher they are the better. 

In selecting hops we must think of the kind of ale for which they are 
to be used. If for pale ale or table beer new hops of a pale yellow 
colour and mild flavour should be chosen. They should have a clammy 
feel when rubbed, and plenty of yellow farina on them. If they are 
required for brewing strong ales, porter, or stout, the strongest hops of 
Kent or Sussex are best, and always as new as it is possible to obtain. 

Hops remain very good, however, for two years, then they begin to 
decay and lose their flavour, unless great quantities are kept together, in 
which case they preserve it much longer. 

They should be kept in a dry place. 

Hops which have grown stale, and lost their natural bitterness, can 
be renovated by unbagging them, and sprinkling them with aloes and 
water. 

Water. 

The quality of the water used in brewing is of the greatest impor- 
tance. 

Experience has proved that the best water for brewing is softandpure 
river water, or that of a stream running over a chalky or gravelly bottom. 
Rivers exposed to the beneficial influences of sunshine and air, and not 
polluted by drainage, make the best ale ; the reason perhaps why some 



2 7 ° The Process of Brewing. 

particular localities, such as Stoke-upon-Trent, Burton, &c, have become 
famous for it. 

Hard water astringes the power of the malt, and consequently requires 
a much larger quantity to be used than soft water does. 

Chalky water also produces good ale, for which Dorchester used last 
century to be famed. 

If, however, nothing but hard water can be obtained, it may be in a 
degree softened by exposure to the air and sun, and putting some pieces 
of chalk to intuse into it ; or, when the water is set to boil, a quantity of 
bran should be put into the copper with it, which will take off part of its 
hardness, and make it better extract the virtues of the malt. 

Brown malt will bear a coarse river water, it is said, like that of the 
Thames about London, but it will not keep more than six months good. 

Yeast should be good, fresh, and white ; bad yeast will spoil good 
beer. 

The brewer should be careful to have every article required for brewing 
ready before he begins, as, if the wort waits for anything that should be 
immediately at hand, it will be injured, 



The Prooess of Brewing. 

We give our readers now the process of brewing, as carried on in the 
writers tamily very many years ago — when, in fact, George III. was king 
— and which produced a home-brewed ale rarely equalled then, and cer- 
tainly not surpassed now : — 

" First, the utensils," says the old receipt, " must be properly cleansed 
and scalded the day before. The malt should be ground a week — if 
brown malt, a fortnight — previously. The water in the copper must then 
be made boiling. The season for brewing should be March if you desire 
the ale or beer to keep well. For the air at that time is temperate, and 
contributes to the good working or fermentation of the liquor, which 
principally promotes its preservation and good keeping. 

" Very cold as well as very hot weather prevents the free fermentation 
of liquors, for if you brew in very cold weather, unless you use some 
artificial means to warm the cellar while the liquor is working, it will never 
clear itself properly, and extreme heat will prove equally detrimental. 
The beer will be muddy and sour, and often past recovery. 

" A damp cellar also affects beer ; the liquor will chill in it and become 
vapid or flat. 

" Beer is therefore better brewed in March, for it will then have time to 
settle before the winter. October is also a good brewing season, if the 
cellars are known to be dry and temperate with regard to cold or heat. 

" All cellars for keeping liquors should be so contrived that no external 
air can get freely to them ; the variation of the temperature of the air will 
affect the liquors and render them unfit for working. 

" A constant temperate air softens malt liquors. 

"And now we come to the process of mashing the malt, to extract from 
it its saccharine matter. The exact heat of the water is of the first im- 
portance. If too near the boiling point it will set the flour of the malt 



Quantities required for making Different Beers. 271 



and turn it into paste, instead of extracting the goodness ; if too cool the 
wort will be without strength, a certain amount of heat being required to 
extract the sugar." 

And now comes in the modern use of the thermometer. Our old 
housewife informs us that the boiling water must be poured into the mash- 
tub, and the steam " suffered to go off, till the person brewing can see his 
or her shadow in the water." We have a more sure test ; and in the fol- 
lowing table we will show by the thermometer the right temperature of 
the water. At the same time we may observe, that three parts of boiling 
water to one part of cold is about right, and the old fashion of looking at 
the shadow will then be justified.

Preparation for Brewing. 

Cleanse the casks ; if quite new scald and soak them for several 
days with a hot brine of salt and water; then put in them some spent 
hops and water with a little yeast and leave it to slightly ferment: old 
casks must be carefully cleaned as previously directed. 

Fill the copper with soft water over night, and light and damp down 
the copper fire so that it may be in readiness next morning. Place your 
utensils. 

Lean the mash tub a little on one side ; mix the boiling with cold 
water till it is of the proper temperature by thermometer {see last page). 
Then let another person gently put in the malt, while you constantly stir 
it. It requires stixringfrom the first. 

When the mash gets thick and is difficult to stir, add more water, 
stirring it continually. 

Leave out a portion of dry malt to cover the mash, and when it is 
wholly wet and soaked, cover this dry malt over it, to prevent evaporation. 
Then cover the mash tub closely with sacks, and leave it to steep. In the 
course of mashing, great care must be taken that the mash is thoroughly 
stirred with the oar from the bottom. Particular attention must be paid 
to the time of steeping the mashes. Strong beer must be allowed three, 
or at least, two hours ; ale, one hour ; and if small beer is drawn after- 
wards, half an hour. 

Before the mash is let run, a pail must be prepared to catch the first 
flush, as it is generally thickish ; another pail must be ready to receive 
the drain while the first thick running is returned to the malt. This is 
repeated till the wort runs quite clear. 

The first mash seldom runs off more than half the quantity of liquor. 
It is necessary therefore to pour the same quantity of water over it 
again, and this is done with a watering-pot, so that the water may not 
drain too fast through the malt. It is called " sparging." The water 
poured in should be of 180 to 185 , according to the weather. As soon 
as the wort for the strong beer has been all drawn off, it must be put, 
with half the hops (previously soaked in water taken from the first mash), 
into the wort copper to boil. While mashing the first malt, fill up the 
copper with water and make it boil ready for the second mash. When 
the second mash begins, water at 180 is poured over the malt ; it stands 
again for a quarter of an hour and is drawn off like the first, returning 
the wort to the tub till it runs clear. 

But meantime we must return to the strong ale in the second copper. 

Quick boiling is essential, though not too quick. 

In order to ascertain the proper time the liquor should boil, try it 
occasionally in a glass ; when it breaks into flakes and the hops sink to 
the bottom, it is ready. 



Fermentation. ' 2 73 



It must not be over-boiled, or it will not fine in the casks. 

Essence of malt is extracted by length of boiling, by which the wort 
can be made of the thickness of honey or treacle. If the wort remains 
too long in the underback after drawing off, it is apt to become "foxy" 
or sour. The average time for boiling the first wort is about an hour 
and a half ; for the wort from the second mash two hours or two hours 
and a half, and for the third, or small beer mash, three hours at least. 
The hops of the first wort, when strained, are returned into the copper 
again, with some fresh ones added for the second mash beer. 

When the wort is intended to be boiled for more than an hour, it is 
best not to add the hops until an hour of the time when it is to be cooled, 
as the aroma is to a certain extent lost in the boiling. 

The hops which are not squeezed retain about two quarts of wort to 
every pound, which, with the loss in evaporation, must be allowed for in 
the quantity brewed. 

The wort when sufficiently boiled is strained into the coolers, and 
should not be more than three or four inches deep in them, except in 
winter, rapid cooling being very essential, as otherwise the wort may 
turn sour. 

While drawing off the first wort, keep the copper well stirred, that the 
hops may not burn on to the bottom. 

The third mash is managed much as the second, but as less saccha- 
rine matter will remain in the beer, it is usual to add to the wort one or 
two pounds of sugar to eighteen gallons, according to the need of the 
beer. 

When the brewing is confined to one quality of beer only, the process 
is the same, except that the whole qtiantity is run through the malt, more 
water being added gradually, and constantly stirred and mixed together 
before hopping and boiling. This beer is called " Entire." 

The malt left after brewing is called brewers' grains. 

Fermentation. 

The principal points to be taken into consideration in the fermentation 
of beer, is the weather, the yeast, and the proper performance of 
mashing. 

If the weather is thundery, it is likely to promote acetic fermentation. 
Warm weather accelerates fermentation, cold weather delays it. 

The yeast, if bad, will obstruct the proper fermentation. 

If the mashes have been made with too cool liquors, fermentation is 
difficult, and the wort impoverished ; while if the liquor used for mashing 
was too hot, it will take some time to cure it by fermentation, or it will be 
" ropy." 

The state of the fermentation will soon show any of these faults. If 
the liquor was too hot, the air bladders on the head of the wort will be as 
large as a pennypiece. If it was too cool there will be few bladders, and 
they will be small. 

The proper temperature of the wort, when the yeast is put to it, de- 
pends on the season of the year. In summer the wort cannot be too cool, 
in winter it may be as hot as 65 , 70 , or 75 P'ahrenheit. 

T 



274 Fermentation . 



The temperature of the place in which the ale is to ferment must be 
also considered, and directed by the thermometer. 

Small brewings require more heat than larger ones ; and if the outer 
temperature be very high, the inner must be kept below it. Cold 
draughts also must be avoided, as they draw off the carbonic acid gas. 
More yeast is required for termentation in cold weather than in warm ; 
at least a quarter less will be required in summer. 

The method of mixing the yeast is this : Say the wort is by thermo- 
meter 6o° ; take a pound of yeast to two quarts of wort, stir them well 
together and place them near the fire for a few minutes, till they begin to 
ferment ; then pour the whole into the fermenting cask, and stir it up with 
the oar. 

The first sign of fermentation is a thin white line round the side of 
the tun, which gradually creams over the surface. By and by a singing 
sound is heard from the gas bubbles as they rise to the surface ; by 
degrees the creamy head, growing thicker and thicker, takes the appear- 
ance of a cauliflower. At first it is white, then yellow, then brownish- 
yellow. If the head is in broad flat flakes, something is wrong, or if the 
air bubbles are of a bluish-white. 

When no cauliflower head appears, the wort is said to be unsound, 
and "to boil." The cauliflower head, when there, grows higher, denser, 
and closer ; the bubbles melt into each other and grow larger, till the 
head, from which they gradually break and sink, becomes a close brownish 
mass, and is skimmed off as soon as it shows a tendency to sink. If it 
tell in, the beer would be bitter. 

Fermentation should be gradual, not too quick. 

It it does not begin in four or five hours, add a little more yeast, 
stirring well together. 

After skimming, take a handful of flour and a handful oi salt, warm 
them by the fire and sprinkle them over the top of the fermenting wort; 
give the whole a good stirring and immediately fill the barrels, which 
must be dry and warm. 

The stillions or tubs under the barrels will receive the yeast as it 
runs over from them.* 

Fill up the barrels every three hours for a day or two. In four or five 
days the ale will have cleared itseli of the yeast. 

It must then stand till the vinous fermentation is finished. This may 
be known by the yeast at the bunghole turning brown and full of holes. 
When this appearance is detected, the barrels should be tightly bunged. 
In three weeks table-beer, and in two or three months the ale will be fit 
for use, according to its strength. 



* The old-lashioned system was to skim off the top barm, then fill the casks 
quite lull, and immediately bung and peg them close. Then a hole was bored 
with a tap-borer near the summit of the stave, at the same distance from the top 
as the lower taphole is from the bottom, for working through that upper hole, 
which is a clean and more effectual method than working it over the cask ; for 
being thus closely confined it soon sets itseli into a convulsive motion oi working, 
and forces itself fine, provided the casks are filled up five or six times a day. 



275 



Proper Management of the Beer Cellar. 

In order to keep strong beer in a proper state of preservation, re- 
member that when once the vessel is broached regard must be paid to 
the time in which it may be finished. If it is likely to be drunk up 
quickly, it will last good to the end, but if the draught is slow, it is best 
not to draw off quite half before bottling" the rest, otherwise it will grow 
flat, dead, and sour. 

In proportion to the quantity of liquor in a cask, it will be a shorter or 
longer time ripening. A vessel which contains two hogsheads of beer 
will require twice the time of one that contains only one hogshead to per- 
fect itself, and it is found by experience that it is wise for those who are 
able, to brew a hogshead at once, instead of a less quantity, as the whole 
hogshead, if it be tit to draw in a year, will have body enough to keep it 
good for two, three, or four years, provided it has a sufficient strength of 
malt and hops. 

In order to fine beer, some people who brew with high-dried barley 
malt put a bag containing about three pints of wheat into every hogshead 
of liquor, which will fine it and make the beer drink soft and mellow. Or 
three pints of wheat malt in a bag, put into a hogshead, will have the 
same effect. 

" But all malt liquors, however well they may be brewed, may be spoiled 
by bad cellaring, which will sometimes make them ferment in the cask, 
and occasionally turn them thick and sour. When this occurs, the best way 
to restore the liquor is to open the bunghole of the cask for two or three 
days, and if that does not stop the fermentation, to put in two or three 
pounds of oystershells — first washed, dried well in an oven, and then 
beaten to a fine powder. After putting them in the liquor must be stirred 
a little, and it will soon settle fine, and lose its sharp taste. 

" If this, however, does not prove effectual, draw the liquor off into 
another vessel, and suspend in it a small bag of wheat or wheat-malt in 
proportion to the size of the barrel." 

"It will sometimes happen that such fermentation takes place from a 
change of weather. If the cellar is no* bad, nothing need be done then ; 
in a few months it will fine of itself and grow mellow." 

In some old-fashioned country-houses it is the practice to dip whisks 
into yeast, then beat it well, and hang up the whisks with the yeast on 
them to dry. The beating and stirring one of these whisks in new wort 
will soon raise a fermentation. It is really better to work the wort well 
in the tun before putting it into the barrels. Some beat the yeast down 
very often while it is in the tun, and keep it there working two or three 
days, observing to put it into the barrel /z«tf when the yeast begins to fall. 
This liquor is in general very fine ; while, on the contrary, that which is 
put into the barrel soon after it is brewed will be several months before it 
comes to a state of perfection. 

With respect to the management of small beer, the first consideration 
should be to make it tolerably good in quality, which will always be found 
truly economical, as it will keep better and nourish the servants more, 
It is a known fact that beer saves butcher's meatj a consideration in these

days of high prices for it. Servants who do not drink beer require more 
animal food. 

It is advisable, where there is good cellarage, to brew a stock of table 
beer in March or October, or both months if possible, in hogsheads. The 
beer brewed in March should not be tapped till October, and that brewed 
in October should be tapped in March. 

It may be as well to observe that, if the cellars are so situated as to be 
exposed to great heat, the October brewing will be best; for then the 
liquor will have time to digest before the warm weather comes. 

If the cellars are damp and chilly, March is the best month to brew 
in. Some experienced householders use the pale malt in March and the 
brown in October, supposing that the pale malt, being then made with a 
less degree of heat than the brown, will ripen better in summer ; and that 
the brown, which has been made with greater heat, can better stand the 
winter. But this is a mere matter of opinion. 

The temperature of the cellar should be tested by a thermometer hung 
up in it. The height should be about 55 ° Fahrenheit. 

Fining with Isinglass. 

When beer is required to become fine, before it has worked itself so, 
or if it does not do so in proper time, isinglass is used to assist it ; and this 
is better than the wheat bag, if it can be afforded. 

The mixture made with it is called " finings." 

The proportion is one ounce of isinglass to a barrel, on an average. 

Dissolve it in sour beer till it is as thick as treacle ; strain it through 
a piece of canvas ; then put a little more beer till it is about as thick as 
cream. 

Draw out a pail of beer and add the finings, whisk the whole to a 
head, then pour it through a funnel into the bunghole. Make room for it 
by previously drawing out another pailful of beer. Then well stir the ale ; 
pour back the last drawn pailful, and replace the bung when the bubbles 
are gone down. 

Try it in a week or ten days. If then it is not clear, add " half a 
pound of salt to a hogshead," or " two ounces to the hogshead of alum or 
quicklime." 

" Ropiness" requires to cure it more yeast and a second fermentation ; 
adding the wheat bag. 

Racking Beer. 

Racking is drawing off beer from the large casks into small ones, for 
use. Whenever this is done be sure to empty the large cask into 
several smaller ones, or it will get flat, from the air filling the empty upper 
part. Add a few hops to each cask. Rack in a small stream, and do not 
leave a large space between the cask and tun as you draw it off. 

Wlien a small cask is opened for use, and gets flat, add a little new 
beer to it ; or make a paste of wheat flour and treacle, and drop it into 
the cask to recover it. 



Bottling Beer — Choosing Corks. 277 



Stout. 

Quantities for one Hogshead : 

1 quarter of pale malt. 2 bushels of brown malt. 

Three-quarters of a bushel of blown malt. 8 lbs. of hops. 

Made as all other beer. 

Porter, 

Porter may be made from the second mash of stout by adding 18 lbs. 
of treacle to it — thus 36 gallons of porter may be obtained. The best 
hop for porter is the Humulus Germanicus. 

Porter Brewed as u Entire T 

Half a quarter of pale malt. 1 bushel of brown malt. 

Haifa bushel of blown malt. 4 lbs. of hops. 

Brew stout and porter by the general rules for brewing. Porter owes 
much of its flavour to a high and rapid fermentation. 

Bottling Beer. 

The first thing to be done is to see that the bottles are very clean, and 
very dry. Wet bottles will turn the beer mouldy, or " mothery," as it is 
called. 

Next the corks must be new and sound ; for if the air can get through 
them the ale will be flat and never rise. There is no saving, but great 
waste in using old corks. 

If a cork has once been in a bottle, even though it has not been drawn 
by a corkscrew, it will turn musty as soon as exposed to the air, and will 
communicate its evil flavour to the bottle it is next put into. 

Choosing Corks. 

Take those which are soft and clear from specks. 

Observe in bottling that the top and middle of the hogshead are the 
strongest and will sooner rise in the bottles than the bottom. 

When you begin bottling go on. If you leave your task uncompleted 
and continue it at intervals each bottle will have a different taste. 

If the cask of beer you have in use grows flat, bottle the beer ; but 
nto every bottle put two or three lumps of sugar, about the size of a 
walnut, out it is best to bottle beer before it has quite completed its 
fermentation. 

If you brew table beer in March or October, some of it may be 
bottled at the end of six months, putting in every bottle a lump of sugar ; 
but if you want good bottled beer, bottle it as soon as it has done 
working. 

Beer should never, however, be bottled while there is any tendency to 
spirt from the vent peg ; but as soon as this has ceased, bottle at once. 



zj8 To Preserve Yeast for Breiving. 



For the flat beer of an open cask you had better put into the bottle 
either the sugar (as before directed) or a few raisins or grains of rice. 

If you find it impossible to keep your bottled beer in your cellars from 
some defect in the latter, you might try the following expedient. 

Sink holes in the garden, purchase and put in the holes some large 
oil jars, and fill the earth close to their sides. One jar will hold a dozen 
bottles of beer, and will keep them well ; but you must take care to closely 
cover the tops of the jars. 

In the winter, when the weather is frosty, shut up all the lights or 
windows of your cellar (if it has any), and close them with manure to 
keep the proper temperature (55 ) up. 

To Preserve Yeast for Brewing. 

When you have plenty of yeast, take a quantity of it, stir and work it 
well with a whisk until it becomes liquid and thin. Then get a clean 
deal board, and with a soft brush lay a thin layer of yeast on it. Turn 
it downwards over a tub or pan to keep it from dust and let it dry. 

When that coat is dry lay on another, and let it also dry ; adding layer 
after layer, as they dry, till you have as much as you wish. This dried 
yeast will keep for several months. 

When you want to use it, cut off a piece and lay it in warm water, then 
stir it well and it will be fit for use. 

If it is for brewing, take a handful of birch tied together, dip it in the 
yeast, and let it hang up to dry. You can make as many whisks as you 
please, but they must be kept carefully from dust. 

When the beer is set to work, throw in one of these, and it will act as 
well in promoting fermentation as fresh yeast. 

" In brewing, one barrel, or thirty-six gallons, is lost by evaporation ; 
half a barrel, or eighteen gallons, by fermentation and racking ; and half a 
barrel is absorbed by the grains." — South Kensington Museum Food 
Catalogue. 

Many things besides malt are used for inferior beers, such as potatoes, 
beans, turnips, and other starchy foods. In Russia a beer is made from 
rye called Quass. 

The Tartars and Turks make a beer from mare's milk, called Koumis. 

In South America a beer called Chica is made from maize. 

In Africa beer is made from an infusion and fermentation of millet- 
seeds. 

Beer is adulterated with salt, capsicums, &c, but not very generally. 
Publicans are said to put in salt to make their customers thirsty. Grains 
of paradise are also added sometimes. 

The householder will do wisely to avoid buying beer at public-houses, 
but have it in barrels in the house, from the best breweries — Ind and 
Coope's, Allsopp's, Bass's, &c. — if he does not brew at home. 

Ind and Coope sell nine-gallon casks, which are more convenient for 
small families ; they allow a good discount for ready money. 

The brewer's men are obliged, if required, to test the quantity in each 
cask delivered, to show that it is full ; and on any complaints from the

servants, or unaccountable ending of a cask of beer, it is well to exact this 
proof from them. 

Beer should be kept in a dry place, but not too hot. 

The adulteration of beer with caramel (burnt sugar) may be detected 
by adding a little tannic acid, which, if the beer is pure, will bleach it 
directly. On the burnt sugar-coloured beer it has no effect. 



CIDER. 

Cider is a spirit distilled from the expressed juice of apples. 

The best apples for cider are not those used at dessert, or for cooking, 
but rough apples which have a light colour with a maze of red streaks on 
the sunny side. 

The apples used for cider must be thoroughly ripe, or the cider will be 
harsh, rough, and unpleasant. The branches of the orchard trees are 
shaken, and the perfectly ripe fruit falls ; the rest is gathered when 
ready ; the last ripe is used for inferior cider. 

The fruit should be separated ; as the yellow apple mixed with red, or 
all yellow, is the one to use for the best cider ; the green apples make an 
inferior kind. Each sort must be collected separately, and kept till 
mellow. This is done by piling the apples in heaps about a foot high, 
and exposing them to the sun and air. As the fruit matures, it gets 
of a deeper yellow. Every heap is examined before grinding, and the 
decayed or green fruit is removed. 

The fruit, when ready, is placed in a circular stone trough with a 
bruising-stone, or in an apple-mill. In the trough the apples are crushed by 
the stone, put in motion by a horse, and this way is thought in Devon- 
shire the best, as the acids of the apple or pear, acting on the metal of 
the iron cider mill, produce a disagreeable taste, and a brown colour. The 
trough stands in a shed, roofed, but open at the sides so that a draught 
of air may pass over it. 

The mess produced by the grinding is called pommage. This pom- 
mage is removed, as it is ready, to the press, so that part is pressed while 
the rest is grinding, though some persons think it ought to remain 
twenty-four hours in the trough before it is taken to the press. Hair 
cloths are spread, and the pommage in large cakes is laid in the press 
with perfect evenness. Upon the whole a strong board is placed, wider 
than the pile on which the blocks rest. 

The hair cloths must be perfectly clean and fresh, or they will com- 
municate a bad taste to the cider. 

The cakes are then squeezed by lowering the screw of the press, and 
increasing the pressure as the cakes become drier, till the must or juice 
is quite squeezed out. This is completed by the long lever and windlass. 
The juice is received in a tub. 

It is then strained through a coarse hair sieve into the fermenting 
vats or casks— generally into the casks. The juice of the apple before 
fermentation consists of sugar, mucilage, acid, water, essential oil, and 
astringent matter. 

Of these constituents only sugar produces ardent spirits. 



2 So Cider. 

The ciderists of Herefordshire attribute much of the strength of cider 
to the rind and kernels, and are particular in grinding them with the 
pulp. 

Fermentation of apple juice should not be conducted with too much 
heat, or the fermentation would be too rapid ; neither must the tempera- 
ture be too low. The degree of heat should be between 40 and 50 
Fahrenheit. 

Cider ferments with a violent ebullition ; the bubbles rise and form a 
scum or crust over the surface of the liquor ; the ascent of additional 
fixed air breaks this crust ; another is formed and again broken, and thus 
it proceeds till the ebullition gradually ceases, and the fermentation is less 
brisk. If then a hissing sound is heard in the liquor the room is too 
warm, and the external air must be admitted. 

All fermentation must be stopped as soon as the liquor is clear. To 
do this it must be racked off into open vessels, and kept cool for a day 
or two. 

Then it must be barrelled and stored in a cool place for winter. In 
Herefordshire the casks are placed in open sheds for the winter, and 
early in spring racked again, and put into the cellar. 

The cider must be racked in a small stream and the receiving tub 
must be close to the tap, to avoid another fermentation. 

Cider casks should be thoroughly clean and dry when filled, and they 
should not be filled within a gallon or two. The casks should be filled up 
every two or three weeks, to supply the waste by insensible fermentation, 
until the beginning of the next March. 

If the cider should be dull it may be improved by putting lump sugar 
into it — two pounds to one hogshead. 

If the colour be bad a little essentia vina will give it any tint it 
may require. 

Cider should be bottled in April, when the barometer is high and the 
wind northerly. It must be strongly corked and waxed over, and secured 
with small string or wire. 

It is said that half a hogshead of cider may be expected from one well- 
covered apple tree.

DAILY DUTIES OF THE HOUSE-MOTHER, 



FEEDING THE FAMILY. 

Having attained some knowledge of the constituent parts, prices, and 
season for different kinds of food, the house-mother will have less diffi- 
culty in arranging the daily bill of fare. 

She should visit the kitchen to give the cook her orders, directly after 
breakfast— or before that meal, if it be habitually a late one. The reason 
for making the hour early is, that much hindrance is put in the way of 
the cook if it is late, and also that tradesmen generally call early for 
orders. 

The first thing to be done is to inspect the larder thoroughly. It will 
contain, doubtless, cold meat, suet, dripping, butter, cheese, eggs, etc., 
and the breadpan. This last should be uncovered and examined, for 
servants are apt to be neglectful and wasteful with regard to bread. No 
unnecessary pieces should be found in it. Only the crusts from having 
grated bread for puddings, cutlets, etc. are allowable. If these exist 
they should be soaked, beaten up with an egg, a little milk, and a few 
currants, and baked as a pudding — a very good one it is. Bread should 
never be used up to the last loaf, so that the household are obliged to eat 
new bread, which is not as wholesome as one-day old bread, and is also 
extravagant. The difference between eating new bread and stale being 
one loaf in five more of the new. If by accident the bread has accumu- 
lated, and the house-mother finds a stale roll or stale loaf too many and 
too hard, the freshness of both may be restored by dipping them in hot 
water, and putting them in the oven, when they will be as fresh as ever. 
Home-made bread is best and cheapest, the weight of water used in 
making it being saved. 

Moreover, home-made bread keeps fresh longer than baker's bread, 
and may be eaten pleasantly the third or even fourth day. There is also 
a greater chance of escaping adulteration of alum, etc. etc. The house- 
mother can guess tolerably well what quantity of bread will be required, 
so that it may not run out suddenly, and should order it accordingly. 
The average quantity is about a quartern loaf for each person, but in 
some families (if ladies only) less will be required, and a small or half 
loaf of 2lbs. will be found sufficient. 

The Flour-bin next requires examination. In it is kept the flour 
used for puddings and cooking generally. It should be kept dry — about 
a quartern of flour a week is sufficient, unless the family is large. Flour 
should be bought of the miller. Firsts are required for puddings and 
tarts ; Seconds (or even whole meal) are much better and more whole- 
some for bread. The baker should be asked occasionally whether bread 
has fallen ; and the price should be ascertained by the housekeeper. 

Next comes the Dripping. This should be nicely clarified, and kept 



282 Feeding the Fam i?y. 



in clean white basins ready for use. It is of great value in housekeeping. 
The mode of clarifying it is this : Put it as it comes from the meat into 
a basin, pour boiling water over it, and stir it round ; set it to cool. When 
it is hard and cold, lift the cake which will have formed off the sediment, 
and put it in the basin, or basins, for use. Cover from dust. Dripping 
is used for basting, frying, making plain meat pie-crusts, and plain family 
cake. The poor buy it at yd. or &d. a pound for eating on bread instead 
of butter. It is in grand households the cook's perquisite. Then, of 
course, the cooking has to be done with butter or lard. The value of 
allowing the dripping in a large household is estimated at from 10/. to 
15/., in addition to the wages. We have heard of a cook refusing to 
give up the privilege for an extra 10/. a year. 

Eggs — the bowl of eggs should be examined, and the number used 
accounted for by the cook. 

If Poultry is kept, the eggs are generally put into the store-room, 
dated, and given out as required, a certain number being kept for winter. 
When bought at the egg merchants a few only should be purchased at a 
time, in case of their proving bad. To try the freshness of eggs see 
pp. 244. As eggs may be wastefully used, it is well for the house- 
mother to recollect or keep a memorandum of what puddings, cutlets, etc. 
she has had during the week. These minutiae of housekeeping are really 
important, and should be jotted down for the sake of remembrance. We 
have found it a good way to enter the dinner ordered daily in a memo- 
randum-book. This both checks expenditure and saves the dreary 
monotony of a frequent repetition of the same dishes. 

Ham should be kept under a wire cover. When very low and dry 
it can be grated off into a jar and kept for ham toast — an excellent break- 
fast dish. The bone suffices to flavour pea soup. 

Bones of all kinds should be inquired for, as they will otherwise 
disappear and be wasted. Every bone (not left on a plate) should 
be stewed down in the stockpot for gravy, or stock for soup. With 
a slight covering of meat they may be devilled. Next comes the cold 
meat. Cold beef may be re-warmed as Breslau de Bceuf (see Model 
Cookery), as Can?ielo?i de Beeuf, or curried, minced, and served with 
poached eggs, scalloped with bread crumbs, etc. etc., or served in cold 
slices, steeped in a mixture of vinegar and mustard, and garnished with 
slices of hard egg or beetroot. It may also be made into croquettes, 
olives, or cakes. 

Cold mutton may be re-warmed as hash or curry. 

Cold lamb is best eaten as it remains with lettuce. 

Cold veal is best minced ; it also curries well ; scalloped \\. is excellent, 
or it makes good blanquettes. 

Cold pork can be curried. 

Cold salt beef makes excellent bubble and squeak, or curry, or cold 
slices, as above. 

Cold rabbit can be fricasseed or curried. 

Cold fowls may be fricasseed, minced, curried, or put into a mayonaise. 

Cold hare is better jugged — which is our English way of braising —

We name these different modes of making rechauffes to help in the 
ordering of dinner and suggest the variety which may spring from one 
joint. 

Cheese must be kept covered. When it is down too near the rind to 
send to table, it can be grated for cheese pudding, or used in Macaroni. 

In ordinary dinners (if the household be large) the luncheon or nursery 
dinner has to be taken into consideration, and the kitchen dinner also ; 
and in reality the task is an easier and pleasanter one for the mistress of 
such an establishment than for the house-mother who has to stint and 
economise. For the roast beef of luncheon or kitchen dinner will supply 
curry, Breslau de Bceuf, olives, etc., for the late dinner, while variety can 
be given with poultry 7 , etc. at a moderate expense. Numbers in fact do not 
increase expense to the extent that might be anticipated ; and a grand house- 
hold is kept (proportionately of course) at a less expense than a small one. 

But now we turn to the house-mother who rules over a smaller realm, 
and has to " cut and contrive." In ordering dinner she requires to 
exercise forethought and observation. For example, if she plans her 
dinners a little beforehand they will fit into each other better. Say she 
has a sirloin of beef one day, the fillet or undercut in tiny slices fried 
with bits of butter and a slice of lemon laid on each, and served on 
mashed potato, makes a nice little dish for dinner. The end stewed ; the 
main piece roasted. Here are three hot dinners ; cold or minced a fourth ; 
the dripping will make the crust of a meat pie ; the bone will go largely 
towards stock, or will suffice for a vegetable soup. Therefore, seeing these 
various ways of doing it, she orders a good sized joint, and not a small one 
which would dry up and be less profitable. Or say that she is obliged 
to have the whites of a certain number of eggs used ; she should take 
care to order some dish in which the remaining yolks may be used. 

If a ham bone has been grated, pea soup will suggest itself for the next 
day, and so on. Observation — thought — foresight are all called into play 
in the due execution of these duties. 

We must here observe that economy is sometimes well shewn in fore- 
going puddings, or at least in selecting the most inexpensive. That they 
are a pleasant and even wholesome variety of diet no one will deny ; but 
they materially add to expense, and are not so beneficial as a fruit dessert. 
Fresh fruit in hot weather is really requisite for health ; and in winter the 
good effects of oranges cannot be denied. We consider that if the house- 
mother cannot afford both a second course and a dessert, it is wiser to give 
up the former, go without puddings and eat fruit ; or perhaps on the days 
cold meat forms the dinner, pudding may appear and no dessert ; and on 
roast meat days fruit and no pudding. 

If in ordering dinner there is much to remember, the cook should be 
made to enter every order on her slate ; and also the articles required for 
making it. 

When dinner has been thus ordered or arranged, the lady should go 
into the kitchen, observe if it is perfectly clean, glance into the closets, 
notice if the kitchen table is kept white and the tins and covers bright, 
and commend or reprove as required. She should then walk into the 
back kitchen or scullery, to see that the sink is clean and qtiite J7~ee from 
bad smells — a very important thing. If anything unpleasant is perceptible, 
chloride of lime should instantly be poured down it. The mistress of the 



284 Feeding the Family. 

house must also not be above asking to look inside the saucepans, which 
should be kept very clean, and never left dirty " to be cleaned another 
time." She should also insist on the knives never being put in the 
basket dirty, but under all circumstances washed, and ready for cleaning. 
Then she should note down in her memorandum-book what hearthstone, 
blacking, emery paper, soda, or soap may be required, and the cook 
should accompany her to the store-room to receive her supplies. 

It is a good plan to do all this every day if possible ; but where time is 
an object, and duties are various and pressing, once a week suffices for the 
examination of the cooking utensils, etc., but then the day of examination 
should not be always the same, but vary, so that no preparation may be 
made for it by a careless or dirty servant. 

Once a week is also often enough to give out sugar and tea for the 
servants, sugar for cooking, etc. etc., soap, candles, soda, and house 
flannels ; though with regard to cleaning utensils the cook may occasion- 
ally have to apply oftener. If any articles are left from the last week's 
giving out she should be asked to produce them, and the quantity should 
be made up. For example, say that you have given out on one Saturday 

1 lb. of rice, 2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of sugar (for cooking), \ lb. of cocoa, 

2 lbs. of candles. The next week there will probably be some of each 
left. It will then only be necessary to make up the quantities to the 
allowances before given out. This will keep the cook with always 
sufficient articles for use and yet with little power to waste. 

The following quantities for each person in a large household are 
thought sufficient for one week : 

Bread. — 8 lbs. or two quartern loaves for a woman servant ; 16 lbs. or 
four quarterns for a man ; but this quantity will vary as more or less meat 
is eaten. 

Meat. — 3! lbs. for a woman ; $\ lbs. for a man, averaging all eaters. 

Milk. — 1 quart, or more if it is for a child. 

Butter. — \ lb. 

Cheese. — \ lb. 

Potatoes.— 3| lbs. 

Beer. — 1 gallon for a woman ; 7 quarts for a man. 

Tea. — Two ounces. 

Coffee. — \ lb. (for breakfast only). 

Cocoa (paste).— Ditto, \ lb. 

Sugar. — \ lb. 

N.B. — In giving out stores for the week the housekeeper must multipl) 
each article by the number of persons, and that will give the quantity 
required. Articles of doubtful use, such as rice or tapioca, may be given 
or not ; an account should be required of the last given out before 
replenishing the kitchen jar. The kitchen spice-box should be filled, 
and the date of filling it entered in the store-room book. 

After having thus far guided the house-mother, we must say a few 
words on marketing. It is certainly best to go to market (if distance 
permits) in person. 

The senses will help in selecting the best materials for feeding the 
family, and there are occasionally times when, from a great abundance, 
or from an impossibility of keeping them, articles generally expensive may 
be had at a moderate price. After settling, therefore, what to have, it is well 



Feeding the Family. 285 

to go and buy it at the shop or market itself — a near market is a great 
economy by the bye — there is a chance of real bargains at it — and at all 
times it is cheaper than the shops (if we except Covent Garden). Ready 
money, of course, gets a fair advantage at it. Vegetables are the most 
uncertain articles as to price (speaking from a London experience), very 
often the same vegetable in every respect is selling at one shop at a 
comparatively high price, and at another close by, for nearly half the 
sum. For these, and for fruit, it is especially worth catering oneself. 

Butcher's meat is pretty generally cheaper at market. A good 
butcher is generally a dear one apparently, but such is not the case if 
his meat be really better than the cheap one's. Prices of meat vary too 
often to give them. 

Bread has a fixed price and rises or falls with the market-price of flour. 

Milk is generally 4a 7 . a quart. Butter u. Sd. to 2s., at present. The 
Aylesbury is the best. Devonshire has a peculiar flavour liked by some 
people. Buy at a trustworthy dairy. 

If, however, circumstances forbid an early walk marketing, then I can 
give no better advice than that of Dr. Kitchener to " employ trustworthy 
tradesmen," who will send for orders and obey them to the best of their 
ability. In this case each daily order should be written down in a private 
memorandum-book, and when the weekly bills or books come in, they 
should be compared with this list. Fix the sum you can allow for house- 
keeping, and never exceed it. 

We will conclude this part of our subject by giving Dr. Kitchener's 
rules for marketing, which are for persons of good income. 

" The best rule is to pay ready money for everything, and to deal with 
the most respectable tradesmen in your neighbourhood. 

" If you leave it to their integrity to supply you with a good article, at the 
fair market price, you will be supplied with better provisions, and at as 
reasonable a rate as those bargain-hunters, who ' travel around, around 
about ' a market till they are trapped to buy some unchewable old poultry, 
tough mutton, stringy cow-beef, or stale fish, at a very little less than 
the price of prime and proper food. 

" With savings like these they toddle home in triumph, cackling all the 
way like a goose that has got ankle-deep into good luck. 

" All the skill of the most accomplished cook will avail nothing unless 
she is furnished with prime provisions. The best way to procure these 
is to deal with shops of established character. You may appear to pay 
perhaps ten per cent, more than you would were you to deal with those 
who pretend to sell cheap, but you would be much better served. Every 
trade has its tricks and deceptions ; those who follow them can deceive 
you if they please, and they are too apt to do so if you provoke the 
exercise of their overreaching talent. Challenge them to a game at 
' Catch who can,' by entirely relying on your own judgment, and you will 
soon find nothing but very long experience can make you equal to the 
combat of marketing to the utmost advantage. If you think a tradesman 
has imposed upon you, never use a second word if the first will not do, 
nor drop the least hint of an imposition ; the only method to induce him 
to make an abatement is the hope of future favours, pay the demand, and 
deal with the gentleman no more ; but do not let him see that you are 
displeased, or as soon as you are out of sight your reputation will suffer 



286 Bow to Keep Receipts— The Breakfast 'Table. 

as much as your pocket has. Before you go to market, look over youf 
larder and consider well what things you require — especially on a Satur- 
day. No well-regulated family can suffer a disorderly caterer to be 
jumping in and out to make purchases on a Sunday morning. You will 
be enabled to manage much better if you will make out a bill of fare for 
the week on the Saturday before ; for example, for a family of half a 
dozen : — 

Sunday. — Roast beef and pudding. 

Monday. — Fowl, what was left of pudding, fried, or warmed in a 
Dutch oven. 

Tuesday. — Calf's head, apple pie. 

Wednesday. — Leg of mutton. 

TJiursday. — Ditto, broiled or hashed, and pancakes. 

Friday. — Fish, pudding. 

Saturday. — Fish, or eggs and bacon. 
" It is an excellent plan to have certain things on certain days. Whefi 
your butcher or poulterer knows what you will want, he has abetter chance 
of doing his best for you ; and never think of ordering beef for roasting 
except for Sunday. When you order meat, poultry, or fish, tell the trades- 
man when you intend to dress it ; he will then have it in his power to 
serve you with provision that will do him credit, which the finest meat in 
the world will never do, unless it has been kept a proper time to be ripe 
and tender." 

Weights and Measures. — As all families are not provided with 
scales and weights, referring to the ingredients generally used in cakes 
and pastry, a comparative list of those weights and measures may be 
useful. Wheat-flour, — one pound is one quart ; butter, when soft, one 
pound one ounce is one quart ; loaf sugar, broken, one pound is one quart ; 
white sugar, powdered, one pound one ounce is one quart ; eggs, eight 
unbroken eggs are one pound ; best brown sugar, one pound two ounces 
is one quart ; sixteen large table-spoonfuls are half a pint ; eight large 
table-spoonfuls are one gill ; a common sized tumbler holds half-a-pint ; 
a common sized wine-glass holds half-a-gill. 

How to keep Receipts. 

The usual way of keeping receipts on files dated with the year is a good 
one ; but a friend has made (for the Editor) a very neat and ingenious 
case of brown holland, which hangs inside the store-room, or closet door, 
and holds the receipts separately. It is about a yard square of holland, 
on which pockets are stitched in rows — i.e. a long strip is stitched on the 
foundation by the bottom line and then divided into pockets. On each is 
marked the purpose for which it is designed — i.e. rent, taxes and rates, 
gas, water, butcher, grocer, baker, milk, etc. etc. The whole is neatly 
bound with ribbon or coloured tape, and is most convenient, as a receipt 
can be found in it in a moment. 

The Breakfast Table. 

A bright-looking breakfast-table is a cheerful welcome to a new day, 
and the housewife should be careful that it may offer nothing to the sight 
and taste but pleasing objects. In this volume will be seen a picture of a 
well-laid breakfast-table.

The Breakfast Table. 287 



It will be seen that at the head of the table are the breakfast cups and 
saucers, the tea-cups to the left, the coffee-cups on the righthand side. 
The teapot and coffee-pot stand in front of the urn ; slop-basin and milk- 
jug to the left ; cream and hot milk to the right. Hotplates should come 
in with hot dishes ; a plate, knife and fork should be set for each person. 
Bread should be on a wooden platter. Hot rolls should be covered with 
a napkin. Dry toast and hot toast must only be sent in when the 
breakfast party are seated, as they are spoiled by keeping. 

The tablecloth should be spotlessly white and smooth, the plate 
brightly cleaned, the china pretty, the food well cooked — tea, coffee, 
chocolate well made. An appetizing breakfast is a great promoter of 
health and good temper. A soiled cloth, tough toast, blackened and 
half-dressed chops, weak or cold tea, are real trials to temper when 
encountered at the beginning of the day. Flowers on the breakfast-table 
are imperative where they are not impossible. 

" Set flowers on your table," says Leigh Hunt, " a whole nosegay il 
you can get it — or but two or three — or a single flower — a rose, a pink ; 
nay, a daisy. Bring a few daisies and buttercups from your last field- 
walk, and keep them alive in a little water ; ay, preserve but a branch of 
clover, or a handful of flowering grass, one of the most elegant as well as 
cheap of Nature's productions, and you have something on your table 
that reminds you of the beauties of God's creation, and gives you a link 
with the poets and sages that have done it most honour. Put but a rose, 
or a lily, or a violet on your table, and you and Lord Bacon have a 
custom in common ; for that great and wise man was in the habit of 
having the flowers in season set upon his table — morning, we believe, 
noon, and night ; that is to say, at all his meals ; for dinner, in his time, 
was taken at noon ; and why should he not have flowers at all his meals, 
seeing that they were growing all day ? Now here is a fashion that shall 
last you for ever, if you please, never changing with silks and velvets and 
silver forks, nor dependent upon the caprice of some fine gentleman or 
lady, who have nothing but caprice and change to give them importance 
and a sensation. The fashion of the garments of heaven and earth 
endures for ever, and you may adorn your table with specimens of their 
drapery, with flowers out of the fields, and golden beams out of the blue 
ether. Flowers on a morning table are specially suitable to the time. 
They look like the happy wakening of the Creation ; they bring the 
perfumes of the breath of Nature into your room ; they seem the repre- 
sentations and embodiments of the very smiles of your home, the graces 
of its good-morrow, proofs that some intellectual beauty is in ourselves, 
or those about us, some house Aurora (if we are so lucky as to have such 
a companion) helping to strew our life with sweets, or in ourselves some 
masculine mildness not unworthy to possess such a companion, or unlikely 
to gain her." 

Breakfast dishes are of themselves pre :ty and taking to the eye. Eggs 
in their stands or in baskets lined with moss, as Plover eggs are served, are 
beautiful in form and colour ; honeycomb, radishes and mustard and 
cress, are all lovely patches of colour on a white ground. 

Chops are not very well fitted for adornment, but brawn and ham are 
picturesque if adorned with plenty of parsley. 

Then twice-dressed meat or fish may appear in scallop shells, which 



Luncheon. 



placed on a white napkin look very pretty ; and no dish looks better than 
lobster cutlets. We suggest also that the breakfast-room should face 
the east to receive the early sunshine. 

On the sideboard should be placed cold joints of all kinds— they rather 
encumber a breakfast table, therefore custom and good taste require a 
cloth over the sideboard or a side-table for them. Here also must be put 
whatever other superfluous food cannot find a place on the table. The 
breakfast table will always be the criterion of the style of the house and 
of the taste of its mistress. 

We subjoin a list of a few breakfast dishes for selection : —

Luncheon. 

The word lunch or luncheon literally means a slice of bread. It was 
added when dinners became late, and since that meal has long passed the 
supper hour of our ancestors, luncheon has become a substantial meal, in 
fact an early dinner, at which the children of the upper classes usually 
dine. 

Our ancestors were content with dinner and supper only ; but probably 
quite as much food was consumed at the two meals as is consumed at 
present.

To Lay a Luncheon. 

It is possible that some amongst our readers may find the accompanying 
plate of a laid luncheon useful, to show to inexperienced servants as a 
specimen of what the table should look like. 

They need only add the information that small knives and forks are 
laid for luncheon ; that caraffes of water should stand at the four corners 
of the table, with spoons, salt-cellars, etc. as for dinner ; and that no 
table napkins are required. The servants hand the plates of whatever is 
eaten once round and then leave the room ; no further waiting (unless fci 
a grand luncheon party) being required.

THE LADY'S SOCIAL DUTIES. 

"Use hospitality one to another without grudging." 

In addition to her household duties the lady of a house has social 
duties to perform, which she is equally concerned in fulfilling well and 
gracefully. Of these hospitality comes first. There has been much 
falling off in the frequency of domestic entertainments since the growth 
of luxury has made home parties so extremely expensive. 

We think it would be well if the middle classes would return in some 
measure to the old-fashioned heartiness of their ancestors, and ask friends 
to spend a social evening without giving them a supper which it would 
cost an immense sum to return. 

The late hours for dinner stand somewhat in the way of small evening 
parties ; still if they were given oftener we believe that much social good 
would arise from them. The sons of the family would not seek evening 
amusement so much at music halls, plays, etc., but would find it at home, 
and their associates would be ladies and gentlemen ; while the dulness of 
girl-life would be exceedingly brightened by them. 

We have heard a lady relate how, in the old " war time," she and her 
young friends used to meet often at each others' houses once or twice a 
week and dance to their own playing ; or play round games of cards — eat 
a light supper of sandwiches and wine, and, as they had walked to the 
friend's house, so walk back again at night, escorted by a servant and a 
group of merry friends. And these ladies were of high station ; one of 
them became afterwards the wife of an earl, and the speaker herself was 
of still better family. 

Amongst the upper middle class these simple gatherings no longer 
exist ; they only entertain expensively; much in the style of far grander 
fortunes, and of course their parties must needs be few and far between. 
But it is time to say something about the present mode of entertainment. 
We begin of course with dinners. 

Dinner parties have become so very expensive that people of small 
means cannot give them ; they are compelled to ask their friends 
separately, or to entertain them at a " kettledrum," or an evening party. The 
latter is not less expensive than a dinner, but is more easily managed 
where the servants are not numerous and the rooms are small. 

Nevertheless the wife of a professional man may often have to entertain 
a party of six or eight, and this may be done very pleasantly if too much 
is not attempted and the guests assimilate well. 

And here we would observe, that if the servant who waits at table — 
whether footman or parlour-maid or housemaid — is used every day to 
wait will, and that the lady points out any little awkwardness or short- 
coming which she may perceive in his or her service, not at the time, but 
the next day, there will be little difficulty in the waiting when two or three 
guests come to dine ; but to wait on a dinner party of eight or ten, two

Dinners. 291 



persons are required. Waiters can, however, be hired, or a clever 
housemaid, occasionally trained, can help the footman. 

Dinners a la Rtisse are now universal, and are very nice, if well 
managed. The table is spread with fruit and flowers only ; a tiny basket 
of strawberries in summer, being placed at each seat near the wine glasses, 
etc. etc. In other respects plate and glass as usual. 

There should be a tiny salt-cellar and a caraffe beside each person ; 
this will be achieved (with a party of eight) by placing the former at the 
end of the table, one at each corner, and one in the middle on each side. 
Soup and fish are handed — then side-dishes — then the principal joints — 
next puddings — then cheese, etc. ; ices and dessert. 

The tin or glass half-moons are a very pretty and new device for 
ornamentation ; the centre may vary according to taste or means. The 
basket of roses given in Frontispiece, or in winter the iced bouquet 
(directions for making which will be found in this book) will form a 
pretty centre. The tin half-moons will ornament the edges of dishes, etc. 
Nothing should be served which the cook is not sure of doing well ; the 
meal, however simple, should be excellent of its kind, and some forethought 
should be exercised as to the cook's power of dishing up in time the 
things ordered, and the capabilities of the grate or stove for cooking 
them. Good soup is not difficult to make, and may be prepared the day 
before ; so also must be the jellies and blancmange. Pigeon or any game 
pie, vols-au-vent and patties may also be ready, and only require warming — 
in short, preparations might commence, to save time and hurry, at least 
two days before. 

The following are a few moderate dinners for middle-class people :—

be within the compass of a moderate cook's powers ; while cheerful 
conversation, ease, and comfort in partaking of the dinner will render it 
quite as possible that it may be a success, as far more pretentious 
entertainments. 

The housekeeper must take care that the cutlets, which are generally 
(in London) sent trimmed and ready from the butcher, are not kept long;

cut apart. A very clever and experienced lady has told us that this 
makes the difference between dried up and mellow tasting cutlets. The 
joint should hang till the cutlets are required. If sent cut from the 
butcher's they should not be quite disjointed, and should be put up close 
together and so tied till required. A chop, cutlet, or steak left all night 
before it is dressed loses great part of its juices by evaporation.

ETIQUETTE OP A DINNER PARTY. 

The lady who gives a dinner party should be very punctual, especially 
if she is one of those who have no house-keeper nor a very large number 
of efficient servants. She should be in the drawing-room some few 
minutes before her guests are expected, that she may glance around and 
see that everything is arranged as she would wish — chairs and sofas 
placed where they can be easily used, etc. 

There is a sad fashion, amongst people of the middle class, of receiving 
their guests in a drawing-room which is not always inhabited, and in 
which the fire is not lighted till about half an hour before the arrival of the 
visitors — nothing more uncomfortable can be imagined. The room feels 
cold — is often damp, the fire looks newly-lighted, and there is a general 
sense of discomfort in it.

Etiquette of a Dinner- Party. 295 

Now if the family habitually occupy the library or breakfast-room, they 
should take care that a fire be lighted in the drawing-room on the morning 
of the day on which they expect guests, so that the room may be well 
warmed in time. Plenty of light, well distributed, is another means of 
ensuring the success of a party. 

The lady should advance a little way to receive her guests ; the chairs 
should be arranged so as not to create any confusion on their entrance ; 
and the welcome should be smiling and cordial, not stiff and 
formal. 

Should a guest be late, or the cookunpunctual, the lady must not show 
any outward signs of annoyance or impatience, but endeavour to make the 
guests forget it by pleasing and amusing conversation. 

Very soon after the last guest has arrived, the servant ought to 
announce dinner, and the host, after directing the gentlemen whom to 
take in, should offer his arm to the lady of the highest rank in the room, 
the gentleman of highest station taking the lady of the house. 

Noav this order of precedency in going in to dinner being likely, if 
violated, to give offence, it is well that the lady of the house should 
arrange with her husband how to marshal their guests before they 
arrive. 

With respect to persons of title, these take precedence according to their 
titles ; though, as eldest sons of peers have intermediate places in the 
scale (so to speak), we advise the lady to have by her, Lodge's " Orders of 
Precedency/' that she may make no mistakes. Foreign ambassadors are 
given the precedence of our nobility, out of courtesy, and with respect to 
their mission ; archbishops rank with dukes ; bishops with earls. 

Ordinary foreign counts and barons have no precedency of title in 
England, but rank about with English baronets or great landed 
proprietors. 

For untitled precedence :•— 

An earl's grandson or grand-daughter, and all near relations (untitled) 
of the aristocracy precede the esquires or country gentlemen. 

Then come — 

Wives of country gentlemen of no profession. 

Clergymen's wives. 

Barristers' wives. 

Naval officers and their wives. 

Military men and their wives. 

There is no specified place for physicians, who, however, are ranked 
in the royal household as next to knights, and whose wives therefore 
would go out after those of barristers. 

These rules appear doubtless to many unnecessary and absurd, but 
they are not really so ; and perhaps there is no truer sign of good 
breeding than to know how to render " honour to whom honour is due." 
Assuredly they are of great use to prevent personal piques at supposed 
preferences and neglects. 

The lady of the house should be at leisure to give her whole attention 
to her guests. If a clergyman be present he is asked to say grace ; if not, 
the gentleman of the house does so. 

The present fashion of giving dinner parties a la Russe, is far preferable 
to the old mode of having the joints, etc., on the table ; but it supposes 



296 Etiquette of a Dinner Party. 

that you have a sufficient number of waiters, as otherwise it would be 
impossible and ridiculous. 

The table, then is laid thus : in the centre is some exquisite ornament 
— an alabaster stand crowned with pine-apples, beneath which hang 
clusters of grapes ; or a frosted-silver tree, with deer, etc., beneath it, 
holding on its branches glass dishes filled with the most picturesque fruit ; 
or any of the centres of which pictures are given in this book ; but it is 
now the fashion to have the centre ornament of flowers very low. Round 
it the dessert dishes are put, intermixed with dishes of preserve, sweet- 
meats, etc. At the house of a nobleman, with whom we occasionally 
dine, the table — a round one — is encircled by small silver camels, bearing 
on their backs silver baskets, holding tiny fruits or sweetmeats. 

Menus, or dinner cards, are placed the length of the table, one for the 
use of two persons ; on these the names of the dishes are written, so that 
the guests may select whatever they prefer. 

Soup is then handed ; sherry is offered after it. Fish follows soup. 

Then the made dishes (which would be side dishes were they on the 
table) are handed, duplicates of each being handed simultaneously on 
each side of the table. 

After these follow the pieces de resistance — turkey, lamb, mutton, etc. 
Then follow game, puddings, tarts, jellies, etc. etc. 

During dinner the hostess should chat pleasantly with her guests, and 
not be too much engrossed with the dinner, or with watching the servants 
waiting. 

Any mistake or slight solecism will be much less noticed if an anxious 
glance does not direct attention to it. 

We have described a dinner d la Russe; but as our book is meant 
also for readers of small income, we shall describe a dinner on a smaller 
scale, and in the present mode of combination of the old and new 
fashions. 

In the centre of the table an ornament, holding fruit, etc. (as we have 
described already), should be placed; close round it the dessert-dishes 
with fruit, etc. 

Soup is put opposite to the lady of the house. If there are two soups, 
a tureen will be at each end and be succeeded by two kinds of fish. 

It may be that the soup is before the lady, and the fish at the same 
time placed before the gentleman. The butler holds the plate close to the 
tureen, and one ladleful is sent to each person. The butler gives the 
plate, when filled, to the footman, who carries it round to the guests. 

The gentleman on her right hand generally saves her the trouble of 
helping it. 

The soup and fish are succeeded by the meat and chickens, or turkey. 
The inevitable saddle of mutton, or the fore-quarter of lamb, are put before 
the gentleman ; the chicken or turkey before the lady, who is assisted in 
carving by the gentleman beside her. 

But before "either of these pieces de resistance are uncovered, the 
servants hand the side-dishes, which are not now put on the table. 

The second course follows : the game is put before the gentleman ; the 
lady has the pudding ; jelly, blancmange, etc., are at the sides. 

When the second course has been removed, and cheese handed round, 
grace is said again, and the dessert follows. 



Etiquette of a Dinner Party. 297 

Ice is handed round first, then the separate dishes of fruit, etc. After 
which the servants leave the room. The wine is passed round the table, 
and the gentlemen help the ladies to it as well as to any more fruit which 
they may require. This is an especial time for conversation. 

Sherry is offered once by the butler after soup, or oftener if there is 
no champagne or hock. Hock is offered with the fish, or chablis takes 
its place. Champagne is taken round three or four times immediately 
after the first entree has been served. Sherry and claret only are put for 
the dessert. Port and Madeira are rarely seen now. 

As soon as the hostess thinks that her lady-guests have finished their des- 
sert, she bows to the lady of the most distinction, and then all the ladies rise 
and leave the dining-room — the hostess remaining the last to go out. The 
ladies amuse themselves in the drawing-room till the gentlemen join 
them. 

During the interval the hostess must endeavour to amuse her guests 
as she best can. Coffee is handed, and sometimes a young lady will play 
or sing, and the hostess must never relax her quiet and unobtrusive 
endeavours to make the evening pleasant. Observation, tact, and a little 
information on the events of the day, are required to make a perfect 
hostess. 

Pleasant and lady-like habits at table are easily acquired, if carefully 
observed daily. But " manner " requires as much, or mo?-e, practice than 
music, and no one will attain a polished ease in society unless she practises 
its habits continually, and at all times, in her domestic circle. She can- 
not put on a habit, or a graceful manner, when she will ; it must be a 
thing of daily life. And, allow me to say, that care bestowed upon it will 
add greatly to the comfort and happiness of home, as well as relieve the 
oppression of awkwardness and shyness in society. 

Now we will describe a plain family dinner, which taxes more closely 
the attention and hospitality of the host and hostess. 

In the dinner parties we have described the hospitality is dispensed by 
the servants ; when a quiet family, with perhaps one or two guests, meet 
round the dinner table, a little more supervision of their guests' comforts 
will fall to the lot of the lady and gentleman of the house. 

Soup and fish are placed on the table, and sent to each person. It is 
rude and inhospitable to ask a guest whether he will take soup 
or fish. He will probably take both ; and it limits him to one by 
the question. It should be helped and sent round by the servant 
waiting. 

The same mode is pursued with the side dishes — they are handed 
round ; the end dishes are helped and handed round. 

It has been the fashion for the last two years to hand cold and hot 
dishes alternately at dinner. Vegetables and sauces are handed as 
cu'ckly as possible by the footman or parlour-maid. "Wine is offered 
by the servants after soup or fish and during dinner, as described 
above. 

A lady ought to know how to carve, and it is well for the daughters of 
a family to learn it in their youth, that they may not be awkward at their 
own table when they marry. 

We subjoin a few plain directions for carving and helping. 

Of soup we have already spoken. 



298 



Carv'un 



Fish is cut with a silver fish-slice, or the more modern large silver fish 
knife and fork. 

Large flat fish, as turbot, brill, John Dorey, etc., must first be cut from 




Turbot. 



Middle Cut of Salmon. 



head to tail down the middle, and then in portions across to the fin, which 
being considered a delicacy, is helped with the rest. {See cut) 

Salmon is cut in slices down the middle of the upper side, as from A 
to B, and then in slices across D to 
C, and a little of the "thick," or 
upper side, and "thin," or under 
side, are put on each plate. 

A mackerel divides between four 
people ; the fish knife is passed 
between the upper and under side 
from head to tail, and each side is 
halved to help. Cod is cut cross- 
ways, like salmon, from C to B, and 
in down slices as from A to B, and 
a small piece of the sound is sent 
with each helping. Small fish, as smelts, are sent whole, one on each 
plate ; as are whiting. 

Fried soles are cut across right through the bone. The " shoulder," or 
head end, should be first helped. 

A sirloin of beef is cut across for the under-cut, and lengthways for the 




Cod Fish. 




Sirloin of Beef, 
upper. You should ask your guest if he or she prefers the under-cut,

which is by some considered the most delicate part of the beef, and is 
disliked by others. Slices from the under-cut should be thick. 

Rolled ribs, and a round of 
beef, are easily carved in horizontal 
slices over the whole surface. 
The slices should be very thin. 

Boiled beef should also be 
cut in thin horizontal slices the 
size of the joint itself in length 
and breadth. {See cut.) 

Mutton appears on the table 
in four forms — the saddle, the 
leg, the shoulder, the loin. 

The saddle is the joint ordered 
for a large dinner-party. It is 
cut in very thin slices ciose to the backbone ; B to A and then down- 




Aitch-Bone.

wards from A to D and C ; but a lady is scarcely ever required in the 
present day to carve a saddle of mutton. 

A shoulder must lie with the knuckle towards your right, and the blade - 
bone towards your left hand. 





Shoulder of Mutton.

apart, and you cut rather thick slices on each side of the opening A to B 
till you can cut no more. 

You will then rind two or three slices from the centre bone to the end 
B to C. Afterwards the joint must be turned over, and slices cut from the 
under-side. 

Some people, instead of cutting the joint in this manner, begin with 
slices cut lengthways near the middle of the joint from the end to the 
knuckle, and it is a better way. 

A leg of mutton must be placed with the knuckle towards your left 




Leg of Mutton. 

hand ; you then cut into the side farthest from you towards the bone 
B to C, helping thin slices from the right and thick slices towards the 
knuckle. The little tuft of fat near the thick end is a delicacy, and must 
be divided amongst your guests. 

A loin of mutton is carved either through the joints, which brings 
it into the form of " chops," or it is cut lengthways, in a parallel line 
with the joints. The latter is the best mode for a lady, but a loin is 
rather for family consumption than for guests. 

A fore-quarter of lamb consists of a shoulder, the breast, and the ribs, 
and, alas ! when the carver has to dissect it ! If a lady is obliged to carve 
this joint, she must first place her knife upon the shoulder, draw it through 
horizontally, and then remove the joint whole, placing it on a separate 




Fore Quarter of Lamb. 



dish, which is held for its reception. She must then cut off the breast and 
separate the ribs {see cut) ; but the cook should always cut off the 
shoulder, and leave it on the joint. 

The hind-quarter consists of a leg and loin. 



Carving. 



301 



A fillet of veal is cut in horizontal slices like a round of beef ; they

must not be too thin. The stnfnng in the centre is taken out and helped 
with a spoon. 




Breast of Veal. 



In a breast of veal the ribs should be first separated from the brisket, 
after which either or both may be sent round. 

A calf s head must be cut down the centre in rather thin slices on each 
side. The meat round the eye is scooped out ; it is considered a delicacy. 
A small piece of the palate and accompanying sweetbread must be sent on 
each plate. 




Half of Calf s Head. 

Roast pork is never seen at dinner parties, but is occasionally served 
at a family dinner. 

The leg is carved like a leg of mutton, but the slices should be thicker 
and not so large. 



302 



Carving:, 



A ham may be cut in three ways — ist. By beginning at the knuckle, 
which must be turned towards your left hand, and cut in a 



slanting 




direction ; or at the thick end, which is then turned towards your left ; or 
in the ordinary manner, like a leg of mutton, beginning in the centre. 

The slices must be as thin and delicate as you can possibly cut them. 
One slice is given as accompaniment to fowl or veal. 

A rabbit has the legs and shoulders removed with a sharp- 




pointed knifr

then the back is broken into 



three or four pieces at the 



joints. 

Hare is thus carved : First take off the legs. Cut two long thin 
slices off each side of the back B to A ; then take off the shoulders, and 
break the back into four pieces with the fork. Cut off the ears,

insert the point of the knife exactly in the centre of the palate, and 
drawing it to the nose, split the head in two. But when only a small 
portion of the hare is eaten, and it is only served at second course, it is 
more elegant for a lady to help a portion of the side with a spoon, as 
we have often seen done. 

The best parts of a hare are the slices from the back, the head, and 
cars. But ladies never eat the two latter. They should be sent to any 
gentleman guest who is known to be an epicure.

A chicken is carved thus : Take off the wings, cut slices from the 
breast, take off the merrythought and side bones. The liver wing is the 
best part of the chicken after the breast ; but you should help the breast

first, then both wings. If you have many to help, manage to reserve a 
slice of white meat to send with the legs and sides. 

A partridge is carved like a fowl ; so is a pheasant. 

A pigeon is cut in halves right down the middle, and half is sent at 
once to the guest. 

A snipe is treated in the same way. 

Very small birds are sent whole. 

A turkey and goose are helped by cutting slices off the breast, and 
then the wings and legs are taken off. Wild duck is helped in the same 
manner. 




Haunch of Venison. 

A haunch of venison should be cut from A to B close to the knuckle.

Coffee is sent to the gentlemen in the dining-room. Tea only is 
handed after dinner when the gentlemen have left the dinner-table. 



MOUSING PARTIES. 

Morning parties, ja called (royal breakfasts occuring at 5 P.M. occa- 
sionally), are generally given during the summer or autumn months. In 
town they are garden parties, breakfasts, five o'clock teas, or concerts ; in 
the country, lawn-tennis or archery meetings. 

At the garden parties a splendid dejeuner a la Fourchette is presented 
to the guests. 

A garden party begins at about four o'clock, and usually ends at 



* For fuller directions for carving see Warne's " Mcdel Cookery." 



304 Evening Parties. 

seven, but very frequently the guests conclude the evening by a dance, 
and sometimes a regular dinner-party and ball follow it. 

But we will speak of the ordinary lawn-tennis party. 

Invitations to garden parties name the hour of meeting and that of 
leaving, generally from four to seven, and state whether lawn-tennis will be 
played, etc. Croquet is now completely exploded as a fashionable game. 

It is usual to play until about six o'clock ; then the players go into the 
house to tea. 

The "tea" is a substantial meal, consisting of all kinds of cold 
delicacies, chickens, mayonaise, ham, ducks, etc. etc. ; all kinds of sweets 
and fruits ; tea and coffee. There is frequently champagne for the 
gentlemen, but wine is not de rigueur, and is rarely given. 

These country meetings are remarkably pleasant and social. 

After tea, unless invited to remain for the evening, the visitors take 
their departure. 

At morning concerts no refreshments are offered. 

"Five o'clock Tea" is now a very popular form of entertainment, 
though more favoured by ladies than gentlemen. For the large and 
ceremonious five o'clock tea (of generally from fifty guests and upwards) 
professional music, both vocal and instrumental, is generally provided. 
The tea is served in the dining room, and consists of tea and coffee in 
large urns, sherry, champagne cup, claret cup, ices, fruit, fancy biscuits 
and cakes, thin bread and butter, potted game, sandwiches, etc. No 
plates are used except for ices and fruit. For small teas similar refresh- 
ments are given on a smaller scale, and the tea is served in the smaller 
or back drawing room ; it is dispensed then by the ladies of the family 
themselves, not by servants ; in the small friendly five o'clock tea only 
tea, cakes, and bread and butter are served, and there is no entertain- 
ment but conversation. Carriages are always kept waiting at afternoon 
teas, for ladies frequently only remain for a quarter of an hour. At these 
afternoon teas the hostess does not ring to order the door to be opened to 
the departing guest, or for her carriage. The lady makes her own way 
to the hall and the servants there call up the carriage.* 

EVENING PABTIES, 

Evening parties vary extremely. They are sometimes for cards, 
sometimes for music, sometimes for a conversazione with occasional 
singing, sometimes a friendly dance ; but this should be specified in the 
invitation. 

Evening parties commence generally at nine o'clock, but occasionally 
at eight, and generally end at half-past eleven. 

The rooms should be prepared for the guests at least two hours 
previously, so that the hostess may not be hurried. Plenty of flowers 
should adorn them ; if the evening is for conversation, etc., only, a chess 
table and a whist table should be placed for any persons who may prefer 
them. The piano should be open ; choice books and prints or photo- 
graphs placed on the table, and the seats arranged not round the room, 
but in groups, so that people may sit about it as they please. 

A great deal of light — in the form of wax candles it is pleasantest— 



* See " Manners and Tone of Good Society." 



Light Supper on Tray. 3°5 

should be given, and ventilation should be as good as it is possible 
to give. 

There should be a room for the guests to uncloak in ; the same apart- 
ment sometimes serves for tea and coffee. 

A long table should be covered with a white table-cloth ; two neatly- 
dressed maids should preside over tea, coffee, cake, biscuits, and thin 
bread and butter, and as each group or individual finishes tea or coffee 
they leave the room, and the footman announces them in the drawing- 
room. -, Here the hostess receives them at the door kindly and graciously, 
and they pass about the rooms to greet friends, etc. etc. 

The hostess, when all are arrived, should move about amongst her 
guests, seeing that every one is amused, and having herself a bright word 
and a kind smile for every one. Cards, music, and conversation should bo 
set afloat. Tact or an earnest desire to promote her friends' pleasure 
will make a good hostess. Trouble must not be spared. 

Supper must be served at ten or half-past ten. 

As few families possess glass, china, and plate enough for a large 
gathering, these as well as rout seats, if required, are to be hired at glass 
and china shops. If a pastrycook is employed to supply the supper, he 
will find also the things required. 

For mere friendly suppers a pastrycook need not be employed, as the 
lady's taste will superintend laying the supper, which may be light and 
elegant merely. When space is wanting, the ladies frequently sit down to 
supper alone, and the gentlemen stand by them and wait on them ; then 
the ladies leave the supper room and the gentlemen take their place. The 
servants in this case should be told to replace half finished or empty dishes 
by duplicates. 

Occasionally people who wish for music or a little chat do not sit 
down to supper at all. A tray is brought into the drawing-room or a table 
spread in a corner, and everything is handed and eaten where the guest is. 
In this case only sandwiches, oyster patties, veal patties, lobster patties, 
and sweets of all kinds are served, the late dinners of the present day 
rendering light suppers imperative unless they follow dancing, and are 
very late. 

During the evening, when the party is large and formal, ices and wine 
are occasionally handed. We give a few lists of suppers for evening 
parties. 

The dress for these entertainments varies, but the present fashion is 
half toilette — not ball costume, unless dancing is specified on the card of 
♦nvitation.

THE BALL-ROOM. 

Invitations to a ball should be issued by the lady of the house in her 
Own name only, about three weeks before the night fixed on for it. 

The requisites for an agreeable ball are — a good room, good music, 
and a good supper. It is of all entertainments the most extravagant — a 
large ball in London generally costing about 300/. Great quantities of 
flowers are used to adorn the rooms ; they often cost 50/. ; lights are 
placed before reflectors on the walls — as chandeliers are dangerous, and 
gas gives an unbecoming glare. The carpet should be taken up, the 
floor polished — but not so as to blacken the ladies' shoes. A good band 
should be hired for the occasion. 

The lady who gives the ball must linger till supper-time near the 
door of the ball-room, to receive and welcome her guests. She should 
have a smile and a few gracious words for every one. 

The sons and daughters of the family must take care to provide 



The Bail-Room. : oJ 

partners for their friends. A well-bred young lady does not dance till 
she has seen that her young lady-friends, generally, have partners. 

The right of introducing partners rests chiefly with the ladies and 
gentlemen of the house ; but a chaperon may introduce a gentleman to 
her charge, and an intimate gentleman-friend may introduce an acquain- 
tance to a partner. 

A young lady must be very careful how she refuses to dance with a 
gentleman ; and she ought, indeed, to have a good reason for so doing. 
She can only say she does not wish to dance that dance (with which 
answer a gentleman will be satisfied), or that she is engaged. 

But if she refuses one gentleman, she has no right to accept another 
for the same dance ; and she must be extremely careful not to engage 
herself to two gentlemen for the same dance. 

Flirtation is always vulgar, but it is perhaps less dangerous in a ball- 
room than out of one ; still, very well-bred girls will not dance too often 
with the same partner, nor linger too long away from their chaperon. 
Three dances are quite as much as a young lady should give to the same 
partner. 

Public balls are not much frequented by people in good society, except 
in watering-places and country-towns ; even then a young lady should 
only be seen at two or three in the course of the year — as, for example, a 
county-ball, a race-ball, a hunt-ball. At public balls there are generally 
three or four stewards, who have to order the dances, change them if 
desirable, and introduce partners to the young ladies. But young ladies 
of good station generally dance with members of their own party. They 
must on no account dance with a gentleman at a public ball unless he 
be presented by the stewards, or by a friend. 

It is not necessary to recognise a ball-room acquaintance the next 
day, unless you choose to do so. The introduction is for a dance, and 
not for future acquaintanceship. To act on it afterwards depends entirely 
on the will of the lady ; and she is not ill-bred if she ignores her partner's 
existence the next day. 

If you give a carpet dance to your young friends, take care to provide 
at least two musicians : a harpist and a pianoforte player are the best. 
You should on no account tax the good nature and fingers of your friends 
by asking them to play for you. 

A ball supper is far beyond the means of any ordinary household to 
prepare. It would be cheapest and best to engage a first-rate pastrycook 
to supply it at so much a head. He will then undertake the whole 
responsibility, and the thing will be well done. During the last season a 
novel and delicious mode of decorating a ball-room was introduced. 
Pillars made of solid blocks of Norway ice, clear and sparkling like 
diamonds, were placed at intervals down the room on each side. They 
stood in great pans in which water-lilies had been placed, and as they 
slowly melted in the heat and dripped into these great tubs of stone, the 
lilies floated on the water. The coolness of the air produced by this 
device can scarcely be conceived if not felt. 

Ball dress is the extreme of full dress, and should be that which is 
the fashion of the day.

CHRISTMAS RECEIPTS. 



To Dress a Boar's Head. 
(An Ancient Christmas Dish.) 
After scalding off the hair from 
the head, and removing the snout, 



boned ; then place it in a deep pan, 
with the tongue and about two 
pounds of the boar's flesh, add a 
bundle of thyme, parsley, and sage, 
one eschalot, about two tablespoon- 



have it thoroughly cleaned and fuls of salt and a few peppercorns^ 



To Cook a Boar's Head, etc 



3°9 



pour over the whole sufficient vinegar 
and water to cover the head, and let 
it stand three days ; then drain it 
from the liquor and fill up in it every 
vacancy (made by withdrawing the 
bones) with the tongue and the neck, 
cut into very thin slices, and rolled 
together ; when the head is filled, 
and its form perfected sew it up and 
tie it in a cloth. 

Put it into a stewpan, with the 
liquor drained from the head, a few- 
cloves, one tablespoonful of salt, 
and a pint of sherry ; let it simmer 
slowly for seven hours, then take it 
out, and when quite cold, remove 
the cloth and the stitches. Place it 
in a dish, glaze* it well, and stick 
in the tusks, put a lemon in its 
mouth, and serve it on a folded 
napkin, decorated with pieces of 
Christmas and rosemary. 

To Ccok a Boar's Head. 

The following receipt for dressing 
a boar's head is a French one : — 
The head must be well singed, and 
rubbed with a piece of brick to re- 
move the hair. Scrape it with a 
knife, and clean it well ; bone it, and 
cut out the two jaw-bones, and take 
off the snout ; slit it underneath, so 
that it may stick to the skin on the 
top, and take out the brain and 
tongue, and rub some salt into all 
the parts of the flesh. Put the head 
together again, wrap it up and tie it 
in a cloth, then put it into a saucepan 
of hot water, with some leaf-fat of a 
pig, two bay leaves, all kinds of i 
sweet herbs, coriander, and aniseed, i 
salt, nutmeg, and cloves pounded, 
some rosemary, and an onion. When j 
half boiled add a quart of wine, and 
let the whole boil for twelve hours. I 
When sufficiently boiled, let it cool 
in its own liquor. When cold, put j 



it in a dish and serve it up. The 
tongue may also be boiled in the 
same liquor. Put a lemon in the 
mouth, and decorate with sprigs of 
rosemary and Christmas. 

Boar's Head Sauce. 

Juice of two Seville oranges, one 
spoonful of mixed English mustard, 
four spoonfuls of currant jelly, a 
little pepper and salt, half a pint of 
port wine : mix all together and 
serve. 

Boast Swan. 

This splendid dish, worthy of a 
piince's table, is only too locally 
known. It is, of course, only 
eligible for the table in its cyg- 
net state. Young swans are called 
cygnets from the Latin name for the 
parent bird, cygnus olor. The swan 
of our rivers and ornamental waters 
is the mute or tame swan, kept from 
flying away by having one of its 
wings pinioned. The mute swan 
pairs, and builds its nest amongst 
the rushes on the shores of small 
islands in the river or the banks of 
pieces of water. With wonderful 
instinct these nests are built up to 
some height, in order to preserve the 
young birds from any sudden rising 
of the waters. The cygnets when 
hatched are of a slaty grey, which 
grows lighter as they grow older. The 
cygnets of the wild swan are white. 

But it is of the grey cygnets we 
have to speak. They are hatched in 
June. If it is intended to eat them 
they must be taken from their 
parents and put into a separate 
swan pond, at the end of August or 
first week in September. 

After they have been "hopped or 
upped," as it is called, from their 
native place grass is thrown to them 



* A Glaze. — One dessert spoonful of Indian Soy and the white of one 
egg. This is sufficient for two Hams or three Tongues, or for rather more than 
a Boar's head. 



Swan Giblet Soup. 



twice a day with their other food for 
a fortnight. They are fattened on 
barley ; a coomb each cygnet suf- 
fices for the fattening. The corn is 
set in shallow tubs just under water. 

Cygnets can only be fattened be- 
fore the white feathers appear ; after 
that no feeding will do any good ; as 
soon as a white feather shows they 
will cease fattening, no matter what 
food they have. They can conse- 
quently only be eaten in December, 
and are a capital and very magnifi- 
cent Christmas dish. Their weight 
then will be from 25 lbs. to 28 lbs. 

We give now the "how to cook 
swans" supplied to the Publishers 
from the place where the dish is 
native, i.e. Norfolk. 

Time, two hours for 1 3 lbs. weight. 
Cygnet must not be skinned ; pick 
the bird, and truss like a goose ; 
take two pounds of rumpsteak, 
chop it fine, season well with spice, 
a piece of onion or shalot, and 
butter. Rub the breast both inside 
and outside with beaten cloves, then 
stuff with the above, taking care to 
sew the bird up carefully and to tie 
it up very tightly on the spit, so that 
the gravy may not escape. Enclose 
the breast of the Swan in a meal 



paste, after which cover the whole 
bird with paper well greased with 
beef dripping. About a quarter of 
an hour before the bird is taken up 
remove the paper and the paste, 
baste well with butter and flour till 
brown and frothy. A swan of 1 3 lbs. 
weight requires about two hours 
roasting, with a fire not too fierce. 
Cut out some tiny swans in white 
turnip for garnish, put a swan (in 
turnip) on each leg and each wing, 
and a paper frill, nicely cut, about 
the shoulders* — See Plate. A 
squeeze of lemon improves swan 
when eaten, and fried bread crumbs 
should be served with it. 

Swan Giblet Soup. 

Cut six pounds of the knuckle of 
veal, and one pound of lean ham in 
a large dish, add three onions, two 
turnips, one carrot, two heads of 
celery, a small piece of sweet basil, 
marjoram, thyme, parsley, and bay 
leaf, and a tablespoonful of salt. 
Butter a stewpan lightly, put in the 
whole of the ingredients, add five 
cloves, two blades of mace, and half 
a pint of water, stew it over a brisk 
fire about twenty minutes ; when it 
becomes a nice light brown colour 



* TO ROAST A SWAN. 

Take three pounds of beef, beat fine in a mortar, 

Put it into the Swan — that is, when you've caught her. 

Some pepper, salt, mace, some nutmeg, an onion, 

Will heighten the flavour in gourmands' opinion. 

Then tie it up tight with a small piece of tape, 

That the gravy, and other things may not escape. 

A meal paste (rather stiff) should be laid on the breast, 

And some whited brown paper should cover the rest. 

Fifteen minutes at least ere the swan you take down, 

Pull the paste off the bird that the breast may get brown. 



THE GRAVY. 



To a gravy of beef (good and strong) I opine, 
You'll be right if you add half a pint of port wine : 
Pour this through the Swan — yes, quite through the belly, 
Then serve the whole up with some hot currant jelly. 



Lamb's Wool. — Furmity— Punch, etc. 



in 



add eight quarts of water, directly 
it boils place it at the corner of the 
stove, scald the giblets in boiling 
water, take them out and cut them 
into joints, the gizzard in four pieces, 
put them into the stock, and let 
them simmer gently until they are 
quite tender, take them out, strain 
the gravy through a cloth, skim 
off every particle of grease, put it 
into a clean stewpan with the 
giblets, and thicken it with arrow- 
root dissolved first in cold water, 
but do not make it too thick ; finish 
by adding half a pint of sherry, the 
juice of half a lemon, and two 
grains of cayenne. 

Lamb's Wool. 

Boil some large cooking apples 
till quite tender, add to them nut- 
meg and cloves ; beat them up to a 
pulp, with enough powdered sugar 
to sweeten them, squeeze over them 
the juice of a lemon, pour over them 
part or the whole of a bottle of 
sherry as required, with a wineglass 
of brandy ; beat well together, and 
serve in a glass dish. Or, 

Take a quart of milk and half a 
pint of sherry, make a nice white 
wine whey with it ; roast some crab 
apples, drop them in the whey, and 
send up hot in a china bowl. 

Furmity. 

Furmity, probably originally Fru- 
menty, from Jrutnentum, the Latin 
for wheat, is one of our oldest 
Christmas dishes. 

It is made of wheat, milk, wine, 
or brandy, and plums, thus : — Put a 
quarter of a pound of wheat into a 
saucepan with two pints of milk, 
and boil it until it is swollen, but 
not broken ; then add a quart of 
new milk, two ounces of raisins, two 
ounces of currants, and sugar to 
taste ; flavour with cinnamon, and 
boil it for a quarter of an hour ; then 
stir in a wineglass of good brandy 



or two wineglasses of sherry (the 
last is best), and serve. 

Punch. 

Three lemons, half a pint of rum, 
half a pint of brandy, sugar to taste, 
two quarts of boiling water. 

Peel the lemons as thin as pos- 
sible, pour half a pint of boiling 
water over them, and cover them 
closely; let them stand till the 
essence is thoroughly drawn out of 
the lemon peel; put the whole 
(water and lemon peel) into a very 
large jug, add the rum, brandy, and 
the juice of two lemons, and sugar ; 
pour boiling water on it till it is of 
the strength you require; strain it 
into a china bowl and serve. If it 
is wished to be drunk cold it must 
stand before sending up. Steam 
the bowl before the punch is poured 
into it hot or it will, in frosty weather, 
crack. 

Punch can be made with the rum 
alone ; it is then much cheaper. 

Wassail Bowl. 

One bottle of sherry, half a pint of 
cold water, six or seven eggs, ac- 
cording to size, quarter of a pound 
of powdered sugar, a little nutmeg, 
and a few cloves, half a pound of 
macaroons, half a pound of rata- 
fias, twelve spongecakes, one lemon. 

Grate the biscuits into an old 
china bowl, and squeeze a lemon 
over them ; beat the eggs thoroughly 
with the sugar and spice ; pour the 
wine and water into an enamelled 
saucepan ; stir till they boil ; then 
pour them by degrees over the eggs, 
stirring one way all the time. If it 
does not thicken put it on the fire 
and stir till it does ; then pour it hot 
over the cakes. Or, 

The Wassail Bowl. 

Ingredients : One pound of ma- 
caroons, one pound of ratafias, twelve

spongecakes, one lemon, one bottle 
of sherry, one quart of custard. 

Crumble the cakes altogether and 
squeeze the lemon juice on them, 
pour over them the greater part of 
the bottle of wine, at least enough 
thoroughly to saturate them ; lay on 
the top a rich custard. 

Make this sweet dish in an old 
china bowl. It makes an excellent 
pair with the punchbowl. 

Punch Jelly. 

Two ounces of isinglass, one pint 
and a half of water, two large lemons, 
two pounds of loaf sugar, two large 
wineglasses of brandy, the same 
of nam, 



Peel one lemon, put it with the 
isinglass into the water, and dissolve 
the isinglass ; put the juice of the 
lemons and two pounds of loaf 
sugar to the two wineglasses of 
brandy and the rum ; strain the 
isinglass water upon the lemon 
juice and spirits ; place it over the 
fire to become hot, but do not let it 
boil ; let it stand a few minutes to 
settle, strain it through a fine hair 
sieve into the mould ; stand it in a 
very cold place, at Christmas it will 
not require ice to harden it ; shake it 
the next day gently into a glass dish ; 
stick a little spray of holly in th;; 
top.

THE WEDDING. 

The trousseau, breakfast, and wedding-cake, are given by the bride's 
family. 

The bridesmaids are chosen, and the bridegroom's " best man," and 
the guests are invited. 

The number of bridesmaids varies from two to eight. The bride 
generally dictates their dress, which should be all alike. If the bride is 
young, the bridesmaids should be young also ; if the lady be middle-aged, 
her bridesmaids may be any age. 

A widow has no bridesmaids. Widows and ladies past their first 
youth generally wear bonnets. A young bride should wear a veil, confined 
round the head by a wreath of orange-flowers, or lilies of the valley. 

As soon as the carriages are at the door, the bridesmaids and mem- 
bers of the family set off for the church. The bride goes next with her 
father ; in some cases the mother remains at home, but ladies now 
generally attend their daughters to the altar. If the bride has no father, 
her nearest relative, or the friend " who gives her away," accompanies 
her in her carriage. 

The bridegroom, and his best man, and the bridesmaids ought to be 
waiting in the church-porch. The father of the bride gives her his arm, 
and leads her to the altar. Her bridesmaids follow, and cluster behind 
her. The chief bridesmaid holds her gloves and bouquet at the 
altar. 

The bride's bouquet should be formed of white roses — if in season — 
azaleas, white camellias, and a very little orange-blossom, or whatever 
white flower may be obtainable. 

The bride quits the church with the bridegroom, and returns home 
with him alone. 

The breakfast follows ; sometimes the bride and bridegroom do not 
remain for it, but usually they are present. 

The wedding-cake occupies the centre of the table— at each end are 
tea and coffee. The viands are cold, and may be as many and as costly 
as you please. The wedding-cake is cut by the nearest gentleman, and 
handed round. 

The clergyman who performs the marriage ceremony is always invited 
to the breakfast. 

The father proposes the health of the bride and bridegroom ; the latter 
is expected to return thanks. The bridegroom's man gives the health of 
the bridesmaids — for whom the bridegroom rises to return thanks. The 
health of the bride's father and mother is generally proposed by the 
bridegroom's father. The speeches are made as short as possible. 

Gentlemen do not remain after the ladies at a wedding breakfast. 
The bride retires and changes her bridal attire for a travelling costume. 
This should be good but plain, like a handsome dress for morning-calls. 

< Presents are usual from the bridegroom to the bridesmaids. The 
bride also will generally bestow some souvenir upon each. 

The evening commonly concludes with a ball. Cards may be sent or 
not, as preferred ; if not sent, the omission should be announced (with 
the marriage) in the Times,

COUNTRY VISITS. 

Visiting in the country is always pleasant. Nowhere does society 
present a more attractive aspect than at the well-regulated countiy-seat. 

The lady who thus receives guests will, however, remember that the 
truest good breeding and the best means of ensuring the pleasure of her 
guests, is to leave them as much freedom to do what they please as 
possible. 

The guest's bedroom should be furnished with a writing table, on 



On Making Presents. 315 



which the lady will place an inkstand, blotting book, and stationery ; 
and also a Bible. A bouquet or two about the room in summer, and a 
fire in winter, will give the chamber a homelike air of welcome. 

If the visitor has no maid with her, the lady's maid or the upper 
housemaid should be sent to see if she requires any attendance, and to 
assist her to unpack if she likes any aid. 

From breakfast-time till luncheon a visitor amuses herself, either 
reading, working, writing letters, or strolling in the grounds, but on no 
account intruding on the morning avocations of her entertainer. 

At luncheon, plans are generally arranged for the afternoon's amuse- 
ments. 

Luncheon is nearly as important a meal as dinner in the present day. 
We will, therefore, say something about it here. 

People are not taken in to luncheon. The hostess sometimes even 
leads the way to the dining-room herself, when the butler announces it. 

It is always now a substantial and elegant meal. The table should be 
well covered ; cold and hot meat, game, vegetables, tarts, pudding, creams, 
&c, are all put on it at the same time ; and after once handing round the 
plates of food chosen, the servants leave the room, and the family and 
guests wait on themselves. 

If there are children in the house they dine with their governess at 
luncheon, and should be trained to behave as little ladies and gentlemen ; 
the little boys acting as small pages, and removing plates, &c. 

Music, charades, and other games are frequent evening amusements 
in country houses. 

You should never, invite yourself to stay with even a near relation. It 
is a great liberty to do so, and may cause inconvenience to your friend, 
or give her and yourself the pain of a refusal. 

A general invitation should never be acted on. It is often given as a 
mere act of courtesy ; if it was meant, it would be followed up by a special 
one, sooner or later. 

The length of a visit is generally now specified in the invitation. If, 
however, it is not specified, a week is as long as you can properly remain, 
unless strongly pressed to do so ; or unless you should be at the house of 
a relative or old friend. But long visits are, in a general way, very 
objectionable, being a great infliction on a family if not desired, and 
standing in the way of the reception of other guests. 

On Making Presents. 

There is much courtesy demanded in giving or accepting a present. 
Do not offer a gift with the assurance that " it is not worth having," or 
that "you really don't want it yourself." Give it gracefully. Ask your 
friend to accept " a trifle as a very small token of your regard," &c. &c. 

" Nothing is more popular than small presents," says Miss Sinclair ; 
and she was right. A valuable gift oppresses the recipient with a sense 
of obligation ; a small gift pleases and obliges at the same time. 

You must not be too eager to return a gift. Wait for a time before 
you do so. The best gifts to offer are elegant curiosities, a book, flowers, 
or game. 

Never refuse a present if you can possibly accept it ; it is very dis- 
courteous to do so. 



3i 6 Morning Calls. 



Married ladies may receive trifling gifts from single gentlemen, who, 
being in the habit of visiting much at their house, may consider they are 
under an obligation for hospitality received which they cannot otherwise 
return. 

MORNING CALLS, 

A morning call should not be paid before three P.M., nor after six. 
No one has a right to intrude (unless by permission) on the quiet morning 
occupations of a family ; nor to detain them in the drawing-room after 
the dressing-bell has rung. 

It is very ill-bred also to call on people at their hours for meals ; you 
should especially avoid making your visit at luncheon time. 

A morning call should never exceed a quarter of an hour in time. If 
other visitors come in during your visit, do not " sit them out," as it is 
phrased ; remain for a few minutes after their entrance chatting to them, 
if they are acquaintances of your own, or if they are strangers to you, 
bearing a part in the general conversation. Then rise and take your 
leave, bowing slightly to the strangers as you quit the room. 

Never look at your watch during a morning visit ; it is very rude to 
do so. 

Do not call with a large party on your friends ; two people are quite 
as many out of one family as would be proper. You ought not to fill a 
room up with your own relatives or friends. Never take your pet dog ' 
with you on a call. Many persons have a great objection to animals 
entering their drawing-room, and others have a fear of, or antipathy to 
them. 

You should always leave your umbrella in the hall, and take care that 
you do not enter the drawing-room with muddy boots. 

Children, also, should be left at home when the mamma goes out on a 
round of visits, unless she is only calling on an old friend. 

If the lady on whom you call is not at home, you must leave your 
card. If she has grown-up daughters or a sister living with her, two 
cards; or you may slightly turn down the corner of your card, which 
signifies that the visit is paid to all. 

It is customary for the names of the daughters who are introduced 
into society to be printed on the same card as their mother's. It is a 
saving of expense and trouble, and is in good taste, we think, as implying 
the protection under which the young ladies visit. 

A card left at a farewell visit has P.P.C. (pour prendre conge — i.e. to 
take leave,) written in the corner. 

After an illness of any kind, or after the death of any member of the 
family, a card " returning thanks " is sent to all whose cards or inquiries 
have been received at the house during the period of affliction. 

Visits of condolence are generally paid on friends in affliction soon 
after the cards of "returning thanks for kind inquiries" have been 
received. 

When morning callers enter your drawing-room you need not advance 
to receive them beyond a few steps ; nor need you lay aside any needle- 
work or light employment in which you may be engaged ; only you must 
take care that all your attention be given, for the time being, to your 
guests. 



Introductions and Letters of Introduction. 3 * 7 



You should strive to be pleasant, kindly, and courteous to your 
visitors, and to let them leave your house with a feeling of satisfaction 
with themselves and with you. 

Take pains to acquire a habit of " small talk " for such occasions, 
which must not, however, degenerate into gossip ; and never let the 
conversation sink into an awkward silence. Inquiries as to the well- 
being of your visitor's family or relatives ; the public-topics of the day ; 
even "the weather," will always furnish matter for chit-chat without 
discussing the characters of other people. Nothing is more under-bred 
than scandal. 

It is not necessary to introduce your visitors to each other at a 
morning call, unless you know they wish to become acquainted. If an 
ntroduction does take place, you must present the person of inferior 
social position to the superior ; the gentleman to the lady ; thus (with a 

slight bow to the lady) — " Will you allow me to introduce Mr. ?" or, 

if the person addressed is an intimate friend, and both guests quite on an 
equality, you need only say " Mr. Smith — Mr. Brown," or " Mr. Smith — 
Mrs. Bell." 

When you are yourself introduced to strangers bow slightly, and 
enter at once into conversation with them ; to bow and take no further 
notice of them, but to continue your conversation with the lady on whom 
you are calling, is a great want of good breeding. 

People who outsit two or three sets of visitors are always considered 
" bores." 

A lady never calls on a gentleman unless professionally or officially. 
It is considered an impropriety to do so. 

Ceremonial visits are made the day after a ball, when it is sufficient to 
leave a card. It is usual to call about a week after a small party. 

When a stranger calls for the first time, you ought to return the call 
in about a week's time ; a long delay in returning a first visit is considered 
equivalent to an unwillingness to accept the new acquaintance, unless 
there has been some unavoidable hindrance, which the lady should 
explain, and for which she must apologize. 

Do not, however, apologize for " not having called for a long time," 
under any other circumstances, or without some perfectly satisfactory 
excuse ; it would be simply a rudeness. 

If you cannot receive a visitor, tell your servant to say that you are 
" engaged," or " not at home." These last words are not, as they are 
someiimes thought, a falsehood, for every one knows they merely mean 
that you are engaged and cannot see visitors. 

A lady should be more richly dressed for calling on her friends than 
she requires to be for an ordinary walk. 



Introductions and Letters of Introduction. 

Never introduce people to each other unless you feel quite sure that 
it will be agreeable to both parties. We have said before that it is right 
to introduce the gentleman to the lady, even when the social rank of the 
former is higher, because ladies have always the precedence of gentlemen. 

If you are walking with one friend and meet another on the road, you 



3i 8 Notes of Invitation, etc. 

must not introduce them to each other, unless you know previously that 
they wish for an introduction. 

At a ball the lady of the house may introduce a gentleman to a lady 
without permission, in order that he may ask her guest to dance. 

Ladies are not obliged to consider their ball-partners as acquain- 
tances, unless they please. 

It is the lady's place to bow first to a gentleman. 

It is no longer necessary to introduce the guests to each other at an 
evening party. You may talk to any one sitting near you easily and 
courteously without any introduction. The fact of the lady or gentleman 
being at your friend's house is a sufficient introduction. 

Letters of introduction should only be given to introduce the bearer 
to a very intimate friend of your own. You put yourself under a great 
obligation to the person whom you request to show civility or kindness to 
a stranger. 

Always reflect whether the person who wishes to be introduced would 
be agreeable to your friend, and whether you have any right to tax her 
time and hospitality for another. 

Should you have a letter of introduction given to you, be sure to send 
it (inclosing your card). Do not on any account call with it yourself. 
If the receiver of the letter is really well-bred, she will call upon you or 
leave her card the next day, and you may then return her visit. She 
ought to invite you to her house if possible, or to show you any other 
attention which may be in her power. 

If you are yourself the recipient of a letter from a friend presenting a 
foreigner to you, etiquette demands that you should escort her to any 
exhibition, whether national or otherwise, which might prove of interest, 
and make a little party or invite a few friends to dinner, to entertain the 
stranger. In short, that best and most unfailing guide to good-breeding, 
"Do unto others as you would they should do unto you," will best direct 
your conduct. 

The letter of introduction is better unsealed. You should request 
your friend to fasten it previous to delivering it, which is virtually giving 
her permission to read it first. 

Notes of Invitation, etc, 

Notes of invitation and reply should be written on small paper of the 
very best quality. For large parties, balls, &c, people now generally use 
printed cards. 

When a note of invitation to dinner is written, it should be in the 
third person, and in the names of both the lady and gentleman of the 
house. 

" Mr. and Mrs. — — request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. — — 's 
company at dinner on Monday, Dec. — , at 8 o'clock." 

The answer accepting should be — 

"Mr. and Mrs. have much pleasure in accepting Mrs. — - — 9 S> 

invitation for Dec. — ." 

Or, refusing the invitation— 



Notes of Invitation, etc. 3 I 9 

" Mr. and Mrs. Moore regret that a previous engagement will prevent 

them from having the pleasure of accepting Mr. and Mrs. 's kind 

invitation for Dec. — ." 
Or— 

" Mr. and Mrs. Moore regret extremely that owing to a prior engage* 

ment they cannot have the pleasure of dining with Mr. and Mrs. on 

Monday, Dec. — ." 

If there be any other cause for refusal, it should be stated in as few words 

as possible. 

Invitations for balls are sent on printed cards three weeks previous to 
the day fixed. The card is the usual " At home " card with the word 
" dancing" printed in the corner ; the word "ball" is used only for quite 
large ones. These invitations, as well as those to " five o'clock teas " and 
evening parties, are given in the name of the lady only. 

We mention this fact, because a lady of our acquaintance tells us that 
she has known an instance in which some excellent people were vexed, and 
fancied they had offended the gentleman of the house, because the invita- 
tion was sent in the name of the lady only. They asked, " What they had 
done to offend Mr. — -, as lie had not joined in the invitation to^hem?" 

Never ask a friend, either in a note or by word of mouth, to " take tea" 
with you — it is a vulgarism ; you should say " drink tea? 

Example of a friendly note :— 

" Dear Miss A. — 

" We have some friends coming to drink tea with us to-morrow; 
will you give us the pleasure of your company also ? We hope you will 
not disappoint us." 

In writing to persons of rank above your own, you should "request 
the honour" instead of "pleasure" of their company. 

In writing to a perfect stranger on business of any kind, you should 
begin your letter with " Sir," or " Madam," and sign yourself " Your 
obedient servant." 

It is usual to write to tradesmen in the third person ; as — 

" Mrs. will thank Mr. Jones to send her five yards of lace, &c, 

at his earliest convenience." 

If writing to a servant, begin with her name, thus— 
" Mary Smith,— 

" Your character is satisfactory, &c. &c, and you can enter 
my service on Monday, 18th inst., when my present housemaid leaves. 

"Jane Morris." 
( The signature alone is sufficient to this kind of letter ; or you may 
Write in the third person, and say — 

" Mrs. Morris is satisfied with Mary Jones's character, and will receive 
her into her service on Monday, Dec. — ." 

Thus much for the mere etiquette of letter-writing. 
We may add, that to answer a letter promptly is a civility, and in 
some instances a kindness. 

Invitations ought to receive an immediate reply if the card bears R.S.V.P.

320 The Etiquette of Walking, Riding, and Driving 



of friends ought to excuse you from keeping your engagement ; as it is 
very disagreeable for the lady who gives the dinner party to have a 
vacant seat at the table, and, perhaps, an odd number to send in to 
dinner. Send an excuse (if one must be made) in time to allow her to 
supply your place. 

THE ETIQUETTE OF WALKING-, RIDING, AND 
DRIVING. 

A well-bred woman will endeavour to acquire an elegant walk. She 
will hold herself erect without stiffness, and walk without a footfall being 
audible in the house. In the road or street she should also walk lightly. 

If you meet a gentleman whom you know slightly, it is your place, as 
a lady, to bow to him first, and thus acknowledge his acquaintance. He is 
not permitted by the rules of society to bow to you first. If you only just 
wish to recognise him with ordinary civility, you must bow slightly and 
distantly, and pass on. But do not, if you are short-sighted, examine him 
first through your eyeglass before you bow ; look at him well before you 
come up to him, and be sure that you know him before you recognise him. 

A lady shakes hands with gentlemen who are friends or intimate 
acquaintance. 

A young lady rather gives her own hand than shakes that of a gentleman. 

A very young lady should not walk out alone ; she should be accom- 
panied by a relative or governess, or attended by a lady's maid. It is now 
usual for* grown-up young ladies to walk without attendance. Ladies and 
gentlemen never now walk arm-in-arm, unless the lady is elderly or 
requires support. 

At watering-places and public promenades it is usual for gentlemen to 
join ladies with whom they are acquainted and walk with them for a 
short time. A gentleman slightly acquainted with a lady raises his hat 
only slightly. 

Now as to riding : 

A lady who rides should be dressed in the fashion of the time — but 
she must not exaggerate it, nor even go to the extreme of it, especially if 
it is at all fantastic. A lady over or gaily dressed on horseback would 
look like a circus-rider. 

A too long riding habit is very dangerous. 

A gentleman helps you to mount your horse. You must gather up 
your habit, and hold it in your left hand ; then place yourself as close as 
possible to the horse, with your face towards the animal's head, and your 
right hand on the pummel. The gentleman stoops and places his right 
hand horizontally, at a convenient distance from the ground. Put your 
left foot in it, and spring upwards into your saddle as he lifts you. 

You should not rise much in your seat, nor lean over the horse's neck, 
nor hold the veins in both hands. 

It is much better for a young lady not to ride out alone, with only a 
groom in attendance, and mothers who permit the violation of this rule of 
propriety are greatly to blame. We should not have so many disgraceful 
stories of young ladies running away with and marrying grooms or riding- 
masters, if they were not improperly left to such low riding associates. 



Presentation at Court. 



You should imitate the best examples in getting into a carriage. Do 
not hurry in. If you are going to sit with your face to the horses, and 
there is one step to the carriage, put your left foot on it — or, if there are 
two steps, put your right foot on the first, and your left on the last step, 
so as to enter the carriage with your right foot, and sink easily into your 
seat. If you are going to sit in the back seat, reverse this action, and put 
your left foot into the carriage first. 

The seat facing the horses is the place of honour, and should be given 
to the eldest ladies, or the first in rank. The lady of the house, however, 
always occupies her own seat on it, and should never be allowed by a 
guest to resign it to her. Do not take a stiff-handled parasol, or a large 
umbrella, in your friend's carriage to scratch the paint. I need scarcely 
say that you must let your guests precede you in entering your own 
carriage, as well as in quitting the room, fcc. 

You may dress rather gaily for a drive. 



PRESENTATION AT COURT. 

The wives and daughters of the nobility are of course eligible for pre- 
sentation at Court, unless there is an objection on the part of the Sovereign 
from some moral cause. Only ladies of good character are received by 
the excellent Queen of England. 

Young ladies of rank, who have violated duty and propriety by a run- 
away marriage, are not allowed to appear at Court, at least for some length 
of time afterwards. 

Only certain professions are admitted at Court after the nobility and 
squirearchy. 

The wives and daughters of the Clergy, of Naval and Military officers, 
of Physicians and Barristers, have a right to presentation at Court. These 
are aristocratic professions. The wives and daughters of solicitors and 
general practitioners are not entitled to a presentation, nor are the families 
of tradesmen, though wealth and connexion have proved a passport thither 
of late years for merchants and manufacturers. 

The lady wishing to be presented must ask the favour — and it is a 
great one — from the friend or relative of highest rank whom she knows. 
The higher the rank, and the more unexceptional the character, the better 
for her. The lady who presents must be at the Drawing-room at which 
her protegee appears to be presented. Any married lady presented at 
Court may present a friend in her turn. 

The regulations of the Lord Chamberlain must then be consulted and 
implicitly obeyed. 

It is desirable to be early, in order to escape the crowd. 

Everything in the shape of a cloak or scarf, even of lace, must be left 
in the carriage. The train must be carefully folded over the left arm, and 
the wearer can then enter and wait her turn to be presented. 

She is at length ushered to the Presence- Chamber, which is entered 
by two doors : she goes in to the ante-room or corridor, instantly 
lets down her train, which is spread out by the officials. The 
lady then walks forward towards the Oueen or Princess. The card 



322 Duties to the Poor. 



on which her name is inscribed, is handed to another lord in waiting, who 
reads the name aloud to the Sovereign. 

When she arrives just before her Majesty, she should curtsey as low as 
possible, so as almost to kneel. 

If the lady presented be a peeress or a peer's daughter, the Queen kisses 
her on her forehead. 

If she is only a commoner, the Queen extends her hand to be kissed 
by the lady, who having done so, rises, curtseys to the Princess of Wales 
and the other members of the royal family, and then passes on, keeping 
her face towards the Queen, and backing out of the door which leads from 
the Presence-Chamber. 

Peeresses in their own right — like peers — can demand a private 
audience of their Sovereign. 



DUTIES TO THE POOR, 

The House-mother should spare something from her abundance, and 
even from her poverty, for the poor. In most country houses soup is given 
away twice a week, and skimmed milk oftener, to the very poor. Where 
there is an abundant supply of vegetables from the garden, these also 
should be given to poor people who may chance to have no gardens. 

The cook should be charged to save all boilings of meat, ham, tongue, 
mutton, chickens, &c, and whatever can be spared ; it will help to make 
soup. Fish-bones will greatly add to it. Scraps of meat left, also should 
be added and boiled in the digester. The longer it is boiled the better, 
and it may be set on at odd times. Add one or two pounds of fresh 
meat, oatmeal, rice, or Scotch barley, with vegetables, and a good soup 
will be had to give away. A little fresh meat should always be given 
towards it, and this should not be strained off, but left in pieces in the 
soup. 

Dripping, which supplies the place of butter, is a valuable gift to the 
poor. 

A good large baked rice pudding, made without eggs, a little suet on 
the top to brown it, makes a good dinner for a family of children. 

All spare pieces of bread should be soaked in water till they are soft ; 
then add sugar, one egg, a little milk and a little spice. Bake it, and it 
will make a good pudding. 

Occasionally give away a few pounds of meat, baked, with vegetables, 
or made into a substantial pie. The crust can be made of clarified fat. 
Tea is a welcome gift to an old woman. A pound of treacle for the children 
would be acceptable. 

Old clothes, too, are very valuable gifts, and the charity is enhanced 
if they are first neatly patched and darned ready for use. A shirt ready- 
or rather home-made, a knitted pair of stockings, a knitted petticoat, are 
all gifts of price. A pillow made of paper shavings, elsewhere described ; 
list cut off flannel makes warm inner jackets, worked nicely together, to 
be worn inside a cotton dress ; and many little garments may be made 
for poor children out of odds and ends of linen, cotton cloth, &c. &c. 

Subscriptions to clothing-clubs, maternity societies, provident societies, 
&C., will occur to all ; but much also may be done by visiting personally; 



Duties to the Poor. -i> 2 , 



and in a friendly and courteous manner, amongst our poorer neighbours, 
and giving just the help which is required at the time. 

"The liberal soul," says the wise man, "shall be made fat;" and 
doubtless the habit of giving will grow with its exercise, and bring down 
a double blessing on the giver and the receiver. 

We subjoin a capital receipt for a pea-soup, which may be made weekly 
at a small expense for poor neighbours : — 

Peas, 16 oz. ; meat, i6oz. ; Pot barley, i 7 _.oz. ; salt, \\ oz. ; onions, 
\\ oz. ; black pepper, 40 grains ; water, 4 quarts. 

The peas must be steeped for four hours in 4 pints of cold water. The 
meat must boil three hours in 5 pints of water. Then boil the peas in a 
muslin bag and meat together in 5 pints of water for an hour. Next rub 
the contents of the bag of peas into the soup, but not letting the skins in. 
Add seasoning of pepper and salt, onions and barley, and boil for an 
hour. Add water from time to time to make up a gallon. 

To Choose Calico. 

Rub it to see that there is not much dress, as it is called, in it. If a 
quantity of white powder falls out do not buy it, however cheap, for it is 
really thin and sleasy, and will not wear well. 

To Choose Silks and Satins. 

A silk should be soft, smooth on the surface, and brilliant or glossy, 
not thin, flimsy, or stiff. Stiff silks cut into holes. 

The purchaser should carefully feel the silk, and gather it into folds. 
If the folds are round and full the silk is soft, if they are stiff and angular 
the chances are that the dress will cut in the folds when made up. 

Mr. John Spiller has found by recent experiments that hydrochloric 
acid is a powerful solvent of silk, although it has little or no effect on 
cotton or wool, at least for a long time. The practical use of this dis- 
covery to ladies is great. The purchaser of a silk has only first to buy or 
obtain a few inches of it, and drop a little hydrochloric acid — to be had at 
any chemist's — on the centre of the piece ; if it be aifture silk a hole will 
be made ; if there is cotton in it those threads will remain. 



FURS, AND SKINS OP BIRDS. 

What they are — How to Preserve — How to Clean and Prepare. 

The use of furs in England as an article of dress did not become 
general till the fourteenth cer.'. 

In 1670 — reign of Charles ' II.— the Hudson's Bay Compair 
incorporated by charter, and the entire trade in furs passed into its hands, 
and furs became cheaper and more abundant. In 1682 an opposition 
company started, but the two were amalgamated under the original name 
in 182 r. The territory of the Hudson's Bay Company Avas of great extent : 
it reached from Canada to the Arctic Ocean, and from the coasts of 
Labrador to the Pacific. It has recently been transferred to the Govern- 
ment, and '.o the nation. London

is the largest fur market in Europe, the Company having nearly 150 
establishments in it. 

Of all furs in the present day the sable is the most valuable, and will 
probably always continue the most expensive, as of all kinds of hunting, 
that of the sable is the most arduous and perilous ; its proper name is 
Mustela Zibclline, or the Sable Marten. It belongs to a group of the 
Digitigrade Carnivora {i.e. from digitus the toe, gradion I walk, — walking 
on the ends of their toes). The Sable Marten is celebrated for the great 
beauty of its fur, but its winter coat is the one which is prized, and as it is 
found only in the northern parts of Europe and Asia, and is most 
abundant in the mountains of frozen regions, the chase for it is perilous, 
and the sufferings of its hunters terrible. The exiles of Siberia are 
employed in this winter sable hunting, and it is said that their sufferings 
from extreme cold, privations of all kinds, and the attacks of wolves, are 
beyond anything which we can imagine. A sad price is paid, indeed, for 
this luxury of the toilet ! 

The fur of the Hudson's Bay sable (Mustela Canadensis) is considered 
the next best to that of the Russian sable ; the colour, however, is a light 
brown, not dark like the Russian, but it is frequently dyed, and is then 
quite as handsome in appearance. The Baum or Pine Marten's skin 
when dyed cannot be told by unexperienced eyes from the true sable. 

The Stone Marten {Martela saxonnn), found in high and stony

districts, is the animal which supplies us with what is called French 
sable, because the French dye its skin so admirably. The natural fur is 
a bluish white underneath, with a top or surface of dark brown hair; the 
throat quite white. It is an excellent skin. The Fisher Martin is a 
larger animal ; the hair of the fur is fuller and longer. Great numbers of 
these skins are brought to England from North America. 

The fur of the Minx resembles sable in colour, but the hair is much

shorter and has a satiny gloss. It is a very durable fur, and is imported 
by the Hudson's Bay Company. 

The Polecats {Mustela fiutorius) are found both in the Old and New 
Worlds. Their fur is thick and soft, their tail long, and they have glands 
which secrete a horribly unpleasant fluid. The Polecat is very common 
in Britain and very mischievous. It hides by day in the thatch of barns 
and unfrequented places, and at night invades the poultry yards and dove- 




i'olecats [M. putorius, Linn. ) 

cots, and commits sad havoc, biting off the heads of the sleeping birds 
and carrying them away. Its fur is known to us as Fitch, and is still 
used, though not much liked, in England. The top hair is black, the 
ground fur a deep yellow. Fitch wears well; but has always an unpleasant 
smell about it. 

The Ermine is another species of Polecat. Its body is about nine 
inches long and its tail about four. It has two coats — a white one in 
winter, with its tail tipped with black — this is the beautiful fur we call 
ermine. In the summer its coat changes to a beautiful brown above and 
yellowish beneath ; it is then called R.oselet. It is found in the northern 
parts of the New and Old continents. The best fur is taken from full- 
grown animals. They are taken generally in traps or snares, so that the 
skin may not be stained. The tails are laid on the pure white skin when 
the furs are prepared for use. Miniver, famous in Troubadour lay and 
story, is the ermine skin with the black tips of the tail spotted at intervals 
over the skin. Ermine was once exclusively worn by sovereigns and 
royal persons, and is still w r orn with state robes. 

The Kolinski {Mustela Sibirica) furnishes the Tartar Sable, as it is 
called; the skin is naturally of a bright yellow colour. It is, however, 



26

dyed into a good imitation of sable. The tail of the Kolinski furnishes 
the " sable" pencils of artists. 




4 Al 








Ermines (M. erminca, Linn.) 

The Beaver {Castor Fibor) is distinguished from all other Rodents, 
by its tail, which is horizontally flattened, of a nearly oval form, and 
covered with scales. 

This animal was once, it is believed, a native of Britain. It is now an 
inhabitant of the most solitary parts of North America; it is also found 
in Siberia and Norway. It is a wonderfully ingenious animal, and builds 
for itself a hut (which it inhabits in winter) with marvellous skill. It is 
always found near the banks of rivers or lakes, and in company with 
others. Beavers aid each other to construct dams or dykes and huts for 
the winter. Each hut contains two or three families, and is of two 
stories. We have not space to give a full account of these wonderful 
dwellings or their inmates, but they are worth reading about. Formerly 
the skins of beavers were in great demand for hats, but happily for their 
existence the fashion has gone out, or they might have shared the 
threatened extinction of the black monkeys. The skin is still used for 
other purposes. When it is well prepared it nearly equals seal skin, 
and is lighter and more lasting. It is probably often worn as seal 
skin, if not sold for it. Beaver and rabbit skins are manufactured into 
felt. 



Furs, ana Skins of Birds. 



The seal (Phocd), the skin of which is now so much worn by English 
ladies, is an amphibious creature, found in the Arctic and South Seas.

The Seal. 

Its natural history is as interesting as that of the beaver but we have no 
space for it here. The coarse hair of the seal covers a fine silky fur. 




The Crested Grebe {Podiceps crista fits). 

The skin takes a great deal of preparation before it is fit for use, and is 
dyed dark brown or black. It is very beautiful and very expensive. 



To Preserve Skins of Birds for Hals. 



Of the fox — red, blue, black, and silver — and of the brown and grizzly 
bears, we need say nothing. The squirrel also furnishes us with a delicate 
fur, light, warm, and lasting, and imitation sable is made from it dyed. 

The chinchilla is a little animal between a squirrel and a rabbit. Its 
fur is very soft and beautiful, but it is not durable, and soon loses its 
lovely bloom. Its fur is brought from Lima, Buenos Ayres, and Arica. 
The darkest and best comes from Arica. Those of Lima have short 
hair and are inferior to the others. 

The Canada lynx {Felis Canadensis) has soft long fur of a greyish 
colour. The Norway lynx is spotted with brown. It is generally dyed 
black and makes pretty muffs, but is not much worn at present. 

The Astrakan, much used now for muffs, jackets, and trimmings, 
comes from Russia. 

But perhaps the most beautiful of all muffs and trimmings are those 
made from the grebe, an aquatic bird, rarely seen on the land, as it has 
great difficulty in walking. It dives very swiftly, and is so beautiful that it 
is considered the standard of perfection among water birds. The 
extraordinary beauty of its plumage has caused the skin of this bird to be 
greatly used in ladies' dress. Seal skin and grebe are occasionally 
united with good effect in muffs, etc., etc. 

To Preserve Skins of Birds for Hats. 

After the bird has been carefully skinned, the skin should be nailed 
out on a board with the feathers downwards, and having been well 
peppered, should be rubbed with a strong solution of alum and left on the 
board till quite dry. It must be placed in the air when drying. 

Furs require the greatest care. They have especially to be guarded 
from damp and moth. Wet or damp spoils fur, especially chinchilla. 
The moment the wearer of fur enters the house after a damp or wet walk 
she should wipe her fur carefully with a very clean cloth, and then dry it 
at a little distance from the fire. It will decay if it is put away damp. 

Before putting furs away for the summer shake and wipe them well, 
(but do not shake chinchilla ; it will not bear it ; it is so fragile), sew 
them up in linen with small bags of pepper with them, or pepper the fir 
— it will shake out afterwards. Cedar shavings put in with the fur are 
also a good defence against moth. Wrap the linen envelope in another 
of coarse brown paper. Carefully wipe out the box or drawer in which 
you place the furs, and take care that it is not a damp place in which you 
leave them. Furs should be examined several times during the summer 
to be sure no moth has got in. They should be put away also before 
moths are about. 

Fur may be cleaned by rubbing dark furs with clean dry bran, and 
ermine with powdered starch till it is white — but both cleanings make a 
great mess in the house, and never answer so well as sending the furs 
to a good furrier. Grebe is cleaned by washing it well with a soft sponge 
and hot soap and water ; then again with warm water only. Brush, down 
with a clean clothes brush.

CLEANLINESS. 



THE HOUSE-MOTHER. 

M It is often said that there are few good servants now : I say there are few 
good mistresses now .... mistresses now seem to think the house is in charge 
of itself. They neither know how to give orders, nor how to teach their servants 
to obey orders — i.e., to obey intelligently, which is the real meaning of all 
discipline." — Notes on Nursing. 

Our motto is taken from Miss Nightingale's " Notes on Nursing," 
and is only too true. 

It is amazing how little the house-mother of to-day (in many in- 
stances) looks after her house. 

Housekeeping is scarcely the shadow of what it was a century ago, 
and the change is surely very much to be regretted. There would be far 
less craving for excitement, whether of pleasure or " a mission," — far less 
invalidism and necessity for wine and tonics, if our ladies would return to 
the good old ways (when they were good) and exercise their true and 
undenied rights in household rule and dainty ways at home. 

In one especial respect the change has been greatly for the worse. 

In former days the ladies of England looked more to the house 
cleaning than they do at present. The consequence was that they were 
stronger, brighter, more vigorous, than they are at present. 

We look back to our own grandmother, and remember a stately old 
lady of ninety-five ! with skin still of a creamy white, few wrinkles, several 
white teeth remaining, able to walk, read, and work as well as she could at 
forty years of age. She never, till the close of her life, indulged in any 
modern luxury. She was a perfect housekeeper. In her youth she told 
us she had been made for the sake of exercise to rub tables and shake 
feather beds before she went into the school-room ; a portion of each day, 
too, was given to household duties. Now what is it? Numbers of 
women, who are well enough off to keep two servants, hardly ever walk 
over their house entirely at the same time. They go into the kitchen, 
look in the larder, order dinner, and remark on it if it is badly cooked, 
comment probably on any palpable housemaid's neglect, and find fault 
with her for it ; but they do not visit every hole and corner as they ought 
every day or every other day (unless some duty prevents it), and see that 
windows are open, dust removed, china utensils washed and sweet, 
especially that basins are not wiped with a nasty cloth which leaves the 
odour of its recent presence ; that saucepans are clean, drains in order, 
closets kept clean and sweet ; yet these are absolute duties to be fulfilled, 
for on perfect cleanliness depends the health of the entire family, especially 
of the children. Perfect cleanliness and pure air are antidotes to scarlet 
fever, smallpox, measles, and low typhoid or even typhus fever. 



13° The House-mot he* 



The house-mother who every day takes this beneficent round is acting 
as the wise guardian of the lives, health, and intellects of those who look 
to her for protection ; such a thought should render the vigilance re- 
quired a delightful rather than a burdensome task. 

She should see especially that the beds are not made up unaired. 
Many housemaids, especially if they have a great deal of work to do, are 
anxious to get the bedrooms " done" early ; so they strip the beds and 
cover them at once, shutting up the damp and unwholesome exhalations 
of the sleeper's body in store for his benefit the next night. Now this 
ought 7iever to be. She should see that the beds are opened and remain 
so for some time ; that the windows are open near them ; that the 
mattresses are rolled back for the air to dry them underneath ; that the 
blankets and sheets are placed in the air ; that the bedstead is dusted ; 
the bed curtains (if there are any) shaken well out and lifted on the bed 
while a slightly damp cloth wipes the carpet beneath it. She should 
require the housemaid never to forget her box for cinders, &c, in the 
winter ; and she should see occasionally if that and the slop-pail is kept 
clean. The latter should be washed out twice a week with chloride ot 
lime and water. Personal observation, the quick eye of the mistress 
(which a little pains will render wonderfully observant) will have a very 
stimulating effect on the housemaid. The lady should never fail to praise 
cleanliness and care in small matters. Self-esteem, once awakened, will 
do much to cause a girl to exert herself ; very much more than blame, 
which discourages and depresses. There is nothing like sympathy in 
influencing people. Let the house-mother show that she takes a real 
interest in her servants' work, and it will become a labour of love on their 
part. 

"Attend," says a wise French writer, "as much to neatness as you do 
to economy. Accustom girls never to suffer anything about them to be 
unclean or in disorder ; lead them to notice the slightest derangement in 
a house ; say to them that nothing contributes more to economy and 
neatness than keeping things in their proper place. This may seem 
trifling, yet it leads to very important consequences ; for then, when any- 
thing is wanted, there will be no difficulty in finding it ; and when it is 
done with, it will be returned to the place from which it was taken. This 
exact order forms the most essential part of neatness. For instance, a 
dish will not be soiled or broken if it is put in its proper place as soon as 
it has been used. The carefulness which makes us place things in order, 
makes us keep them clean. Joined to all these advantages is that of 
giving to domestics a habit of neatness and activity, by obliging them to 
place things in order, and keep them clean." 

Dust is one of the greatest enemies of domestic comfort, and a sad 
destroyer of furniture. We are bound to wage continual war with it ; not 
only on this account. It is inhaled into the lungs, and becomes one of 
the sources of disease. Miss Nightingale says with great truth, " No 
particle of dust is ever or can ever be removed or really got rid of by the 
present system of dusting. Dusting in these days means nothing but 
flapping the dust from one part of a room on to another with doors and 
windows closed. What you do it for I cannot think. You had much 
better leave the dust alone, if you are not going to take it away alto- 
gether." A damp, but not wet, duster will alone remove without scattering

it ; and a friend of ours of great experience, and whose house is a perfect 
picture of cleanliness, worthy of Holland itself, asserts that she rarely 
has her carpets swept. They are wiped over with a damp (but only 
moist, not wet) duster. Thus the carpets are preserved from the wear of 
the brush, and the dust is not scattered over curtains and furniture. 

Again we quote from the wisest of women : — 

" Air can be soiled just like water. If you blow into water you will 
soil it with the animal matter from your breath. So it is with air. Air 
is always soiled in a room where walls and carpets are saturated with 
animal exhalations. 

" Want of cleanliness, then, in rooms .... may arise in three 
ways. 

" 1. Dirty air coming in from without, soiled by sewer emanations, 
the evaporation from dirty streets, smoke, bits of unburnt fuel, bits of 
straw, bits of horse dung. 

" If people would but cover the outside walls of their houses with 
plain or encaustic tiles, what an incalculable improvement would there be 
in light, cleanliness, dryness, warmth, and consequently economy. The 
play of a fire-engine would then effectually wash the outside of a house. 
This kind of walling would stand next to paving in improving the health 
of towns. 

" 2. Dirty air coming from within, from dust, which you often displace, 
but never remove. And if you never clean your furniture properly, 
how can your rooms be anything but musty ? Ventilate as you please, 
the rooms will never be sweet. Besides this, there is a constant degrada- 
tion, as it is called, taking place from everything except polished or 



;lazed articles- 



in colouring certain green papers arsenic is used. 



Now in the very dust even, which is lying about in rooms hung with this 
kind of green paper, arsenic has been distinctly detected. You see your 
dust is anything but harmless ; yet you will let such dust lie about your 
ledges for months, your rooms for ever." 

The house should be thoroughly cleaned from garret to cellar once 
every year ; the ceilings, if dirty, whitewashed, or papered (the latter mode 
is good, and the effect, especially when the paper covers a cracked ceiling, 
excellent, and it is as cheap as whitewashing, and can be done without 
injuring the wall papers), and the papers cleaned with bread. 

Papers which are glazed clean best, and are therefore cheaper in the 
end than unglazed papers. We give receipts for cleaning every article of 
household use in the following pages : — 



To Test the Purity of the Atmosphere. 

Fill a glass tumbler with lime 
water, and place it in any convenient 
position. The rapidity with which 
a pellicle forms on its surface cor- 
responds to the amount of carbonic 
acid, or foul air, present in the 
atmosphere that surrounds it. 

To Clean Wall Papers. 
Let the servant or man employed 



get on high steps, and first brush 
the wall all over with a perfectly clean 
brush. Then divide a stale loaf in 
large pieces, and rub the paper down- 
wards with it in firm clear strokes ; 
he must not go back over it with the 
same piece of bread, nor rub it up 
and down, only downwards. The 
bread will remove all the dirt and 
leave the paper like new ; but it 
must not be used dirty, a fresh piece

must be taken when the last used is 
soiled, otherwise dust will be carried 
from one breadth of the paper to the 
next. 

To Remove Grease Spots. 

If there are any grease spots on 
the paper, cover them with a little 
moist fuller's earth, and when it is 
dry brush it off. Repeat the appli- 
cation if required. 

To Clean Paint. 

This receipt is given in an American 
publication. 

Get some of the best whiting ; 
powder it and then sift it, so that it 
may be as hue as possible. Put it 
in a plate for use. Get some clean 
warm water in a basin, and apiece of 
soft flannel, and a new soft chamois 
leather. 

Dip the flannel in the water and 
squeeze it nearly dry : then rub it 
down in the whiting, and take up as 
much as will adhere to it. Rub the 
paint gently with it and it will clean 
it perfectly. Next lightly wash the 
part done with clean water, and dry 
with the chamois leather. The paint 
will look as well as if it were just 
done, and the most delicate colours 
will be uninjured. It is a better 
mode than the old one of soap and 
water, and ii is also quicker about. 

Window-cleaning should be done 
by men, if the windows are high up. 
Nc woman should be allowed to run 
the risk of breaking her neck from a 
height, nor to stand where she is 
indelicately exposed to observation, 
but she ought to clean the inside of 
the windows with the footman or 
hired cleaner. 

Plate-glass is best cleaned with 
wet whiting, which is afterwards 
washed off, and the glass is rubbed 
with a chamois leather. 

If paint-splashes have been left 
on the panes of glass by the painter, 



it can be removed by washing the 
glass with soda and water, which 
will quite clear it from them. 

Board Cleaning. 

Boards should never be rubbed 
across, but up and down the boards. 
After being well scrubbed with soap, 
hot water, and a brush, they should 
be washed over again with clean 
water and soft cloth, and then well 
dried by hard rubbing. To extract 
oil from boards (it is frequently upset 
on them by careless painters), make 
a lye of pearl-ashes and rain-water ; 
add to it unslacked lime as much as 
the water will absorb ; stir well 
together ; let it settle, and bottle it 
for use. Dilute it with rain-water 
when required, and wash the greasy 
spots quickly with it. Do not let it 
remain wet, for fear of discolouring 
the boards. Boards may be whitened 
by scrubbing them with soft water, 
sand, and slacked lime. This will 
also destroy insects. 

How to Clean Carpets. 

Carpets should be swept the way 
of the pile, with wet tea-leaves, to 
prevent the dust from flying over the 
curtains and furniture, A short- 
handled soft brush should be used 
for valuable carpets, and the servant 
must sw-eep it with care once a week. 
Once a year carpets should be well 
shaken. For cleaning them when 
they are laid down, we recommend 
a wash called Proctor's Carpet Re- 
novator. It must be used as fol- 
lows : — 

Let the article be well shaken and 
freed from dust ; then with a flannel 
and hot water wet the part to be 
cleaned ; rub on the renovator, and 
again use the flannel and hot water, 
then rub dry with a towel. 

Carpets should be shaken, and 
put down as for use, and a smali 
portion done at a time.

It is also used for cleaning and 
restoring the colours of carpets, 
druggets, woollen materials, moreens, 
damasks, silks, etc., rendering them 
equal to new with very little trouble 
or expense. 

Bedroom carpets should be wiped 
over, especially under the bed, with 
a damp cloth every day, or at least 
three times a week. 

The house-wife who has her carpets 
wiped with a damp cloth daily (if 
mud be on them, the spots must first 
be brushed off), will find that it is 
only necessary to sweep them once 
a week, and that they will last for 
years longer than if they were swept 
daily. Of course the cloth must not 
be wet, only damp enough to pick 
up flue and dust. But however it 
is cleaned, be sure that it is done 
often and effectually, for the sake of 
health. 

" A dirty carpet," says Miss Night- 
ingale, "literally infects the room. 
And if you consider the enormous 
quantity of organic matter from the 
feet of people coming in, which must 
saturate it, this is by no means sur- 
prising. 

" As to floors, the only really clean 
floor I know is the Berlin lackered 
floor, which is wet rubbed and diy 
rubbed every morning to remove the 
dust. The French parquet is always 
more or less dusty, although in- 
finitely superior in point of clean- 
liness and healthiness to our absor- 
bent floor." 

Polished floors, well varnished, 
with a mere strip of carpet by the 
side of the bed (in bedrooms), is 
better and healthier than our present 
carpeted rooms. 

For Removing Grease from Carpets. 

Half a wineglassful of Fuller's 
earth, half a wineglassful of mag- 
nesia. Mix the above in a basin 



with boiling water ; put it hot on the 
grease-spot or spots, and leave it on 
till it is dry, then brush it off, and 
you will find the spots are gone. 
Or if the grease is recent, lay a sheet 
of blotting-paper over it and iron 
over the spot with a hot flat iron ; 
it will come out into the blotting- 
paper, but you must keep moving 
the paper and applying fresh parts 
of it till the heat has absorbed the 
whole of the grease. 

To Remove Ink from Carpets. 

If the ink is just spilled, take up 
as much as you can with a spoon 
and with blotting-paper. When you 
have taken off all that is possible, 
wash well with skim milk (London 
milk does as it is), then wash again 
with hot water. As soon as the 
accident happens, wet the place with 
juice of sorrel, or lemon, or vinegar, 
and the best hard white soap. Old 
ink-stains are hard to get out ; but 
they can be removed by first wetting 
the spot, and then applying salts of 
sorrel. Wash off immediately, how- 
ever. 

Fuller's earth mixed with lemon- 
juice will also take other stains out 
of carpets. 

Carpets should not be swept with 
the whisk-brush above once a week. 
It wears them out if it is used 
ofcener. 

To Clean Floor Cloths. 

Sweep them, and wash them now 
and then with milk ; never scour 
them with a brush, or use soap or 
hot water to them, as it would take 
off the paint. A soft cloth and luke- 
warm water are all that is required 
to clean them. 

Oil-cloths are washed when they 
require it with a soft flannel wetted 
with milk ; or with a mixture of 
salad-oil and weak table beer. 
Never use soda or soap to them.

To Clean Strata Matting. — To Clean Glass, etc. 



To Clean Greasy Cocoa-nut Matting. 

Thoroughly scrub it all over with 
hot water and soap, then loosely fold 
it and put it into a large washing- 
tub. Pour a quantity of cold water 
over it. then hang it out on a line in 
the sun to dry. 

To Clean Straw Matting. 

Wash as seldom as possible ; but 
when it becomes imperatively neces- 
sary to do so, use salt and water. 
Salt will prevent the matting from 
turning yellow. Dry as fast as you 
wash, and wash only a small space 
at a time. 

Stained boards are dusted and 
polished as stained furniture would 
be. 

To Clean Glass. 

Tumblers and wine-glasses should 
be washed in cold water in which a 
little soda is dissolved, then turned 
up to drain, dried with a soft, clean, 
and dry cloth, and finally polished 
with a leather or an old silk hand- 
kerchief. Chandelier or lustre glasses 
are washed in the same way. De- 
canters require careful cleaning. First 
have ready some strong suds of white 
soap and water and a little pearl- 
ash. Mash up an egg-shell well, 
drop it into the bottle, pour in 
some of the soap-suds, and shake it 
well about till the bottle is clean, 
then empty it ; put in fresh suds and 
clean inside with a small sponge on 
the end of a glass-stick ; rinse out 
twice with clean cold water. Next 
put them into the soap suds, and if 
they are cut, wash them with a re- 
gular glass-brush ; next rinse the 
outside. Dry the inside with a small 
clean piece of linen on the end of 
your glass-stick. Wipe the outside 
with a dry glass-cloth, and polish off 
with a leather or silk handkerchief. 

For cleaning and mending china, 
see " China Closet.' ; 



To Remove Rust. 

To remove rust from steel, cover 
with sweet oil, well rubbed on it ; in 
forty-eight hours use unslacked lime 
powdered very fine. Rub it till the 
rust disappears. To prevent the 
rust, mix with fat oil varnish four- 
fifths of well-rectified spirits of tur- 
pentine. The varnish is to be ap- 
plied by means of a sponge ; and 
articles varnished in this manner 
will retain their brilliancy, and never 
contract any spots of rust. It may 
be applied to copper, philosophical 
instruments, etc. 

To Distinguish Iron from Steel. 

Let a drop of diluted nitric acid 
fall on the metal, and after a few 
minutes wash it off with water. If 
the metal be steel, a black spot will 
be left on it ; if it be iron, a whitish- 
grey spot will remain. The reason 
is, that the nitric acid dissolves the 
iron in both cases, but the charcoal 
that enters into the composition of 
the steel remains undissolved, and 
constitutes the blackness. 

To Clean Marble. 

One oz. of potash, 2 oz. of whiten- 
ing, and a square of yellow soap, cut 
into small pieces ; boil all together 
in a saucepan, until it begins to 
thicken ; apply this with a large 
brush to the marble. If the marble 
is very dirty, let it remain on all 
night ; if not, one hour will be suffi- 
cient. Then wash it carefully off 
with plenty of cold water and a 
sponge. Take care the mixture is 
not applied too hot. Or : — 

Equal quantities of soft soap and 
pearlash. 

Put the soap and pearlash on the 
chimney-piece with a soft flannel ; 
let it lie on it for a few minutes. 
Wash it off with warm water, not 
too hot ; wash it over a second time 
with cold spring water. Acids act 



To Clean Brass. — To Clean Ormolu Ornaments, cte.

on marble. Marble is itself com- 
posed of carbonate of lime — that is, 
it is a compound of carbonic acid 
and lime. Now the carbonic acid 
has a comparatively weak affinity 
for lime, and most other acids will 
prevail over it and take its place 
when brought into contact with it ; ! 
thus destroying the texture of the j 
stone, liberating the carbonic acid, 
and leaving some salt of lime, in 
the form of a white powder, in its 
place. 

When marble has had its polished 
surface eroded by acids — and even 
lemon juice or vinegar will do this 
readily — the only mode of repara- 
tion is to have the marble again 
polished by the use of polishing 
powders, such as emery. 

Neither spirits nor water produce 
any permanent effect on marble, 
but fixed oils and grease soak into 
its substance, and it is impossible 
to remove them, as any agent potent 
enough to act on the grease will 
also destroy the texture of the mar- 
ble. A portion of the grease may 
be extracted by covering with ful- 
ler's earth or pipeclay. But marble 
should be carefully preserved from 
contact with grease or oil. 

Alabaster is so called from Ala- 
bastron, the name of a small town 
in Upper Egypt, near which the 
stone was very abundant. There 
are two kinds of alabaster, one a 
white semi-transparent sulphate of 
lime, and the other a compact crys- 
talline carbonate of lime, The 
former is the real alabaster, and is 
so soft that it may be scratched 
with the nail, while the latter is 
quite hard and effervesces in acid. 

Alabaster must not be cleaned 
with soap and water. It is cleaned 
by rubbing it with lemon-juice by 
the Italian manufacturers of it. 

To Clean Brass. 
Rub it with a little sal ammoniac 



finely powdered and wet. Warm 
the brass first : polish with wash 
leather. Or : — 

Rub with a soft wash-leather 
dipped in sweet oil ; then with finely 
powdered rotten-stone. Polish with 
wash-leather. The Americans use 
powdered rotten-stone, well mixed 
with a pint of water. Then a tea- 
spoonful of sulphuric acid is added. 
This mixture is applied gently, then 
rubbed off, and the brass polished 
with powdered whiting which has 
been sifted through muslin. Use 
wash-leather in all cases. Some 
persons wash the brass with the 
sulphuric acid and water, and then 
polish with rotten stone, etc., etc. 



To Clean Ormolu Ornaments. 

The best way to clean ormolu 
ornaments is to rub whiting, mois- 
tened with gin, well on the articles 
with an old toothbrush. Rub it off 
with a clean one, and polish with a 
leather. 

To Clean Real Bronze. 

Wash the ornaments gently (with 
a sponge) with soap and water, 
then rinse them in beer. Do not 
wipe it off or rub the ornaments at 
all, but place them in a warm room, 
at a little distance from the fire, 
until they are quite dry. Use very 
little soap. 

Bronzed chandeliers, lamps, etc., 
should be only dusted with a feather 
brush or soft cloth. Washing takes 
off the bronzing. 



To Clean Gilt Lamp and Chandeliers. 

Wipe off the dust with a soft 
cloth, and wash gently with fine 
soap-suds and soft hckewarm water. 
Any wrought work may be carefully 
cleaned out with a very soft tooth- 
brush.

One ounce of soft soap, two 
ounces of emery, made into a paste : 
then rub the article for cleaning 
with wash-leather, and it will give 
a brilliant polish. 

For Removing Paint from Wood. 

Mix lib. of soda, such as is used 
for washing ; 2lbs. of lime, un- 
slacked. If the paint is very strong 
on the wood, add \Vo. of potash. 

Mix these ingredients together, 
and dilute with water until the mix- 
ture becomes rather thicker than 
whitewash, and then rub it on the 
paint with a piece of wood folded 
up in rag. The person who uses 
this preparation must be careful not 
to touch it with his hand. 

To Clean Japanned Waiters, Urns, etc. 

Rub on with a sponge a little 
white soap and some lukewarm 
water, and wash the waiter or urn 
quite clean. Never use hot water, 
as it will cause the japan to scale 
off. Having wiped it dry, sprinkle 
a little flour over it ; let it rest a 
while, and then rub it with a soft 
dry cloth, and finish with a silk 
handkerchief. If there are white 
heat marks on the waiters, they will 
be difficult to remove. But you 
may try rubbing them with a flannel 
dipped in sweet oil, and afterwards 
in spirits of wine. Waiters and 
other articles of papier mache should 
be washed with a sponge and cold 
water, without soap, dredged with 
flour while damp ; and after a while 
wiped off, and then polished with a 
silk handkerchief. 

Wood Furniture. 

The greatest care should be taken 
to keep furniture fresh and clean. 
If the house-wife is neat and careful 
her property will last much longer 
than otherwise, and her dwelling 



will always possess a charm too 
often wanting in more pretentious 
dwellings. 

Furniture which is French po- 
lished should be carefully dusted 
every day, and polished once a 
week with the furniture polish to 
be bought at any good chemist's. 
Generally these polishes are better 
and really cheaper than any that 
the housekeeper can make herself. 
" The chemical and mechanical ac- 
tion of different substances on 
articles of furniture is very little 
understood by persons in general, 
and consequently the most absurd 
directions are frequently issued for 
the preparation of cleaning materials, 
and also for preventing injury from 
certain agents. The substances from 
which furniture is chiefly exposed to 
injury are water, oils, spirits of 
various kinds, such as brandy, eau- 
de-Cologne, benzine, etc., and acids. 

Varnishes, or polished surfaces of 
wood are easily injured by volatile 
mineral spirits, such as those used 
for lamps, or by any alcoholic spirit, 
as brandy, or wine. The polish is 
composed of gums and resins which 
are soluble in spirits. Many of 
these polishes or varnishes are made 
by dissolving the materials in alco- 
hol, then when they are applied the 
spirit evaporates and the gum or 
resin is left in a thin polish or 
varnish on the wood. Of course, if 
wine, brandy, or spirits of wine fall 
on it, a portion of it is again dis- 
solved, and the brilliancy of the 
surface is destroyed. The only re- 
medy for these kinds of stains or 
marks is to have the table, or what- 
ever it may be, repolished. 

Heat has the same effect on 
French polish. A hot plate, or dish, 
or cup, or mug, placed on it, leaves 
its shape as a dull mark on the 
table. Therefore, dining tables are 
better not French polished, but well 
rubbed with oil. When furniture is

not French polished, it is well to 
rub it with linseed oil, slightly 
coloured with alkanet root. Every 
time the dinner table is rubbed all 
the leaves should be put in, so that 
the portions of the table may be of 
the same colour, for oil darkens 
mahogany, and if the leaves are not 
rubbed every time there will soon 
be a great difference of shade be- 
tween them and the table. 

A Capital Receipt for Polishing Tables. 

Cold-drawn linseed oil, I pint ; 
spirits of wine, I oz. ; white tonic 
vinegar, I pint ; spirits of turpen- 
tine, i oz. ; powdered gum arabic, 
\ oz. ; butter of antimony, i^ oz. ; 
spirits of salt, I oz. 

The above ingredients to be well 
mixed together and shaken previous 
to being used. 

Family Receipt for Polish for Furniture 
not French Polished. 

Three oz. of bees' wax; 3 oz. of hard 
white soap ; 1 oz. of spermaceti, 
cut up small and simmered in a 
pint of water, keeping it stirred all 
the time. Pour it into a jar and 
keep it well covered. 

We give the following excellent 
receipt, which proves experimentally 
to be good for those who may wish 
to polish a table or box for them- 
selves, premising that the surface to 
which it is applied must be perfectly 
cleansed first : — 

French Polish. 

Shellac, one ounce and a half; 
mastic, half an ounce ; sandarac, 
half an ounce ; rectified spirits of 
wine, two ounces. Pound the gums 
very finely in a mortar, and put 
them in a bottle which will rather 
more than hold the whole quantity ; 
stand the bottle in a kettle of cold 
water, which bring slowly to a boil ; 



let it boil for some time, until the 
contents of the bottle become like 
treacle (this requires great care), 
stirring the while with a wire rod. 
Roll several yards of flannel list 
into a flat coil, put a little sweet oil 
on it, and cover with a piece of old 
linen ; on this apply the polish. — 
The Field. 

Furniture Polish. 

Half a pint of spirits of wine ; \ oz. 
of gum shellac ; \ oz. of gum ben- 
zoin ; \ oz. of gum sandarac. 

Put the whole into a bottle for a 
day or two, and shake it a few times. 
When the gums are dissolved it is 
fit for use. When you think the 
polish is laid on thick enough, take 
a clean wad and cloth, put a little 
clean spirits of wine on the wad, the 
same as you did the polish, and rub 
it up the same way, but rub very 
lightly, and rub until quite dry. 
You must put a little oil on the 
cloth the same as in laying on the 
polish. 

For Polishing Furniture. 

Half a pint of vinegar ; half a pint 
of linseed oil ; two pennyworth of 
butter of antimony. 

To Clean the Face of Soft Mahogany 
or other Wood. 

After scraping and sand-papering 
in the usual manner, take a sponge 
and well wet the surface to raise the 
grain ; then with a piece of fine 
pumice-stone, free from stony par- 
ticles, rub the way of the fibres ; rub 
the wood in the direction of the 
grain, keeping it moist with water ; 
let the wood dry then ; if you wet it 
again you will find the grain much 
smoother, and it will not rise so 
much ; repeat the process, and you 
will find the surface perfectly smooth, 
and the texture of the wood much 
hardened. By this means common 
soft Honduras mahogany will hare

To Clean and Lay by Curtains, etc. 



a face equal to Hispaniola. If this 
does not succeed to your satisfac- 
tion, you may improve the surface 
by using the pumice-stone with cold- 
drawn linseed oil, in the same man- 
ner as you proceeded with water ; 
this will be found to put a most 
beautiful, as well as durable, face 
to the wood, which must then be 
polished or varnished. 

To Clean and Lay by Curtains. 

In summer it is usual to lay by 
curtains of rep, damask, or chintz, 
and replace them with lace or mus- 
lin curtains, which look much cooler, 
and the more expensive rep and 
chintz are preserved by it. Rep 
curtains should be well brushed and 
shaken ; wrapped in linen cloths, 
and put away (protected by bags of 
pepper, cedar shavings, or cam- 
phor, from the chance of moths) in 
a dry closet or a deep drawer. 
Chintz should be spread on a long 
table and rubbed all over with clean 
bran and flannel, which cleans the 
glaze nicely. Then fold and lay 
them by. If chintz curtains have 
the dust blown off them once a 
week by a pair of bellows, and are 
taken down and well shaken once a 
quarter, they will last seven years 
without . requiring cleaning. The 
writer speaks from experience in 
this matter. It is wiser to have lace 
and muslin curtains cleaned than 
washed, and quite as cheap. Chintz 
should also be sent to be cleaned 
and re-glazed when dirty. 

To Clean Covers which are not Silver. 

Put a piece of mottled soap (about 
2 oz.) and about the same quantity 
of whiting into a jug and pour 
boiling water on it ; mix till it be- 
comes a thick paste, quite smooth. 
Then rub it on the covers, let it dry, 
and rub off with dry whiting and a 
leather. This preserves the covers 



from being scratched. The insides 
and outsides of covers should be 
carefully wiped the moment they 
are brought from the table. 

There are also pastes sold for 
cleaning covers, about the best of 
which is Graham's paste; but the 
old fashioned mode of using soap 
and whiting for the purpose does 
very well and preserves the covers 
longer. 

When they are plated, they are 
best cleaned like other plate, with 
gin and 
powder. 

To Clean Tins. 

Clean tins as you would clean 
covers, with soap and whiting mixed 
to a cream in boiling water. Lay 
it on with a piece of leather ; let it 
dry, and then rub it off with dry 
whiting and a clean leather. 

To Clean Copper and Brass. 

Mix oil and brickdust, or oil and 
finely powdered rotten-stone (sifted 
through muslin) together ; rub it on 
with a piece of leather ; let it rest a 
little on, and then rub off with a dry 
soft leather. 

Many people use oil of turpentine 
and rotten-stone, but the copper very 
soon tarnishes after its use ; others 
use oxalic acid, but this is so dan- 
gerous a poison, and so painful if it 
chances to get into the servant's 
eyes, that we strongly object to its 
use. 

To Clean Lacquered Brass. 

Wash with a stiff lather of soap 
and water ; let the brass lie in it for 
three days, taking it out every day 
and brushing it with a hard brush ; 
let it dry, and then rub it with a 
eather. 

To Clean Stair-rods. 

Mix finely-powdered rotten-stone 
and sweet oil to a paste, then rub it

on each rod with a piece of flannel 
or woollen. Polish with the dry 
powder of the rotten-stone and a 
nice leather. 

The same mixture, carefully ap- 
plied to inlaid brass or brass handles 
of furniture, answers very well ; but 
care must be taken not to let it 
lodge in any network or hollows of 
the brass. 

To Clean Candlesticks. 

Melt all the wax or grease off with 
boiling water ; but on no account 
melt it by putting the candlesticks 
before the fire, as it melts the solder. 
Tin candlesticks must be cleaned as 
other tins are. Plated candlesticks 
should be cleaned with plate-pow- 
der. 

To Clean the Inside of Pots, Pans, 
and Kettles. 

Boil in the kettle or pot a little 
sal-ammoniac for the space of one 
hour, to remove the fur. Be sure to 
wash out a dirty saucepan with boil- 
ing water the moment you finish 
using it. 

To Clean Steel or Iron. 

Make a paste of two ounces of 
soft soap and four of emery-powder 
— that is, two ounces of coarse 
emery-powder and two of fine. Put 
this paste on fire-irons, fenders, etc., 
and afterwards rub off with dry wash- 
leather. Some people use crocus- 
powder moistened with sweet oil. 
This is best for polished steel. 

To take Rust out of Steel. 

The steel must be covered with 
sweet oil, and left for 48 hours, then 



rubbed with leather, and this must 
be repeated till the rust is removed. 
Or you may rub it with the finest 
emery-paper. 

To Clean Cast Iron and Black Hearths. 

Mix together blacklcad and whites 
of eggs to a liquid consistency ; paint 
the stove, etc., all over with it, and 
rub bright with a hard brush.* 

To Clean Looking-Glasses. 

Wash them with spirits of wine ; 
dry them ; powder slightly with 
whiting, and rub off with a leather. 
Take care that the whiting does not 
get into the edge of the frame. 

Polish the mahogany frames with 
furniture paste. Beware of spill- 
ing scents on polished looking-glass 
frames, as it removes the polish. 

To Clean Plate. 

Plate should be treated with great 
care. Never put it into a basket or 
tray with knives, nor mix spoons with 
forks, for fear of making scratches, 
which nothing will remove. Wash 
it directly it comes from table with 
warm water and soap, rinse it in 
cold water, wipe it, rub it well with 
a leather. Never suffer mercurial 
preparations to be used for silver. 
It is a really saving plan to boil it 
for half an hour in soft water, with 
whiting and yellow soap enough to 
make a lather. Rinse it with cold 
water, wipe with a soft towel, and 
rub with a leather. 

Gas blackens silver sadly, and the 
deep stain can only be removed by 
a plate-powder. Rouge (which is 
made by the precipitation of sulphate 



* A most excellent varnish to prevent rust is made of one pint of fat oil 
vamish, mixed with five pints of highly rectified spirits of turpentine, rubbed on 
the iron or steel with a sponge. This varnish may be applied to bright stoves, 
and even mathematical instruments, without hinting their delicate polish. — Dr. 
Brewer's " Guide to Science," p. 260.

of iron by carbonate of potash ) 
is most generally used, and does 
very well. In our own household 
the plate is cleaned by being first 
nicely washed in warm water and 
wiped dry. Then a mixture is made 
with whiting and gin, or spirits of 
wine (which is in many respects 
better), and it is rubbed wet on the 
silver. A sponge is used to rub 
this mixture on, as it is soft. It is 
let dry very thoroughly, so that it will 
rub off like powder with a piece of 
flannel ; then it is polished with a 
chamois leather. Be sure that the 
whiting is reduced to the finest pos- 
sible powder. It should be ground 
quite fine and even, then sifted 
through coarse book-muslin, as any 
rough bits will scratch. 

To take Stains out of Silver. 

Steep the plate in soap, let it lie for 
four hours, then cover it with whiting 
wet with vinegar, so that it may 
stick upon the silver, and dry it by 
the fire ; after which rub off the 
whiting, rub it over with dry bran, 
and the spots will disappear, and 
the plate look bright. 

To Remove Ink Stains from Silver. 

The tops and other portions of 
silver ink-stands frequently become 
deeply discoloured with ink, which 
is difficult to remove by ordinary 
means. It may, however, be com- 
pletely eradicated by making a little 
chloride of lime into a paste with 
water, and rubbing it upon the 
stains. 

An Old Family Receipt to make Plate 
look like New. 

Take of unslaked lime and alum 
a pound each, of aqua vitae and 
vinegar each a pint, and of beer- 
grounds two quarts ; boil the plate 
in these ingredients, and it will re- 
ceive a beautiful polish from them. 



Plate is best polished by the naked 
hand, but the operation gives some 
pain to the rubber. Jewellers thus 
polish plate, but it requires the thick- 
skinned, yet soft, palm of a practised 
hand to do it. 

Egg-spoons get discoloured and 
tarnished by the sulphur in the egg 
uniting with the silver as soon as it 
is moistened by saliva. This tarnish 
is a sulphuret of silver, and may 
easily be removed by rubbing it with 
table salt or a little hartshorn. 

Let the plate in use be counted 
over every night — a card with a list 
being kept in the plate-basket — and 
the basket carried to the master's or 
lady's room. 

To Clean Britannia Metal. 

Finely powdered whiting, two 
table-spoonfuls of sweet oil, and a 
little yellow soap melted to some 
thickness : mix, with a little spirits 
of wine. Rub this cream on with a 
sponge or soft flannel, wipe it off 
with a soft cloth, and polish with a 
leather. 

To Clean a Metal Teapot. 

Put into it a solution of common 
soda boiling hot ; let it stand twelve 
hours near the fire ; then pour it 
away, and wipe with a clean cloth. 

To Clean Gilding. 

Brush off dust with a feather 
brush. Never wipe with linen, it 
takes off and deadens the gilding. 

To Clean Steel Knives and Forks. 

The moment used knives are 
taken into the kitchen, they should 
be dipped in warm water and 
wiped, taking ca7'e not to wet the 
handles. 

Knives are cleaned on a board 
covered with I ndia-rubber, with brick- 
dust sold for the purpose. In some 
large families Kent's knife-cleaner

is used. This machine saves labour, 
but requires care in putting the knives 
in. Printed directions and a powder 
for it are sold with the machine. 

Knives are cleaned on the board 
by being rubbed smartly on it, with 
brick-dust spread on the surface. 
Steel forks are washed, dried, and 
also rubbed on the board with brick- 
dust. The intervals between the 
prongs are cleaned with a small bit 
of stick wrapped in leather and 
rubbed in brick-dust. 

Knives are often stained by fruit 
or vinegar. The stains can be re- 
moved by rubbing them with a piece 
of raw potato before they are cleaned 
on the board. 

To make Windows like Ground Glass. 

Make a hot solution of sal-ammo- 
niac. Brush the solution over the 
pane or panes ; the moisture will 
instantly evaporate and leave a beau- 
tiful radiated deposit. 

Flies. 

House-flies are very destructive to 
furniture. They may be effectually 
destroyed by mixing half a spoonful 
of ground black pepper, a teaspoon- 
ful of brown sugar, and a teaspoonful 
of cream. Place the mixture in a 
room where flies are troublesome. 

Or :— Put saucers of strong green 
tea, sweetened, about the room. This 
will poison flies. 

They also dislike elder leaves, and 
will keep away from them. 



To Kill Beetles or Crickets. 

Parings of cucumber strewn near 
their holes, or strong snuff. 

To get rid of Ants. 

A little green sage placed in their 
haunts will drive them away. Quick- 
lime scattered over their hills and 
watered, will destroy them. 

How to take Ink out of Boards. 

Strong muriatic acid or spirits of 
salts, applied with a piece of cloth ; 
afterwards well washed with water. 

To Purify Bottles. 

Wash well with water and powdered 
charcoal. 

To take out Spots of Ink. 

As soon as the accident happens, 
wet the place with juice of sorrel or 
lemon, or with vinegar, and then rub 
with best hard soap. 

Cement for Glass. 

Equal parts of flour, powdered 
chalk, and finely pulverized glass ; 
half the quantity of brick-dust, 
scraped lint, and white of egg. 

To Preserve Water Fresh. 

Put into the barrel or cistern 3 lbs. 
of black oxide of maganese, pow- 
dered ; stir it well, and the water will 
keep good an indefinite time.

THE LAUNDRY AND FUEL. 



THE LAUNDRY, 

Washing is in the present day seldom done at home, unless the family 
reside in the country, for drying-ground in London and other large towns 
is wanting. The laundress, therefore, fetches the soiled linen on Mondays 
and returns it on Saturday. The charges for washing differ in different 
places. In London it is possible to get it done for is. per dozen, including 
everything ; but this is not the price of good washing. Ordinary London 
charges are — id. each the large articles of underclothing, except petticoats, 
which vary from 4^. to 6d. orSd., according to trimming ; id. the stockings 
per pair, collars id. each, cuffs id. the pair, table-cloths 4d., kitchen do. 3d., 
table napkins id. each, sheets ^d. per pair, towels gd. per dozen, handker- 
chiefs \d. each, fish cloths id. each, counterpanes Lf., curtains 2s., etc. etc. 
Servants are usually allowed is. 3d. per week each for their own washing. 

But many trifling articles may be washed at home even in London, and 
the house-mother who can do her own lace, or the costly trifles belonging to 
the baby, will find that she saves much more than the pence charged 
for washing. Fine work and lace will last instead of rapidly going to rags. 

Two books should be kept for the laundress — one at home and one in 
her hands — to prevent any possible loss of the list. The clothes should 
be looked over on Monday morning, sorted, mended if required, and put 
up for the wash. All stains should be removed before the article is sent. 

The laundress brings the clothes home on Saturday. The housemaid 
should count it over carefully by the book, and look at the marks, so that 
nothing may be changed, for an exchange is sometimes as bad as a loss. 

Washing at home must now be taken into consideration. A woman 
is generally hired to assist the servants where there is no washing-machine ; 
her wages are in London is. a day, and she expects beer three times a day, 
and gin-and-water at night. Everything is put ready for her before she 
arrives. 

Where a laundrymaid is kept, no assistance is of course given, though 
sometimes the under servants assist in the ironing. 

The washing and wringing machines of recent invention make household 
washing, where there is a drying-ground, both cheap and easy. In 
general, servants will not use machines, disliking the trouble of cleaning 
them ; the only ones which obtain favour in their eyes are the sewing, and 
the washing and wringing machines. Where these are possessed (with the 
ground for drying) it is far better to wash at home. The family are safer 
from infection of all kinds, and it is decidedly cheaper and pleasanter. 

We give for home washing some few receipts, which may be found 
useful. 

Clothes should be well aired before they are sent up from the laundry, 
and sorted into sets according to their marks. 



To Wash Clothes. — To Bleach Linen, etc. 



343 



To Wash Clothes. 

Half a pound of yellow soap, I lb. of 
soda, |- lb. of lime, to three quarts of 
boiling water ; let the lime^and water 
remain all night ; boil the soda and 
soap to a paste in three pints of clean 
water ; when boiling, put the lime 
water to it. Soak the clothes and 
towels over night ; wring them out 
and put them into the boiler with 
from half to one pound of soap ; boil 
twenty minutes, then rinse them out. 

To Bleach Linen. 

Pour over a quarter of a pound of 
chloride of lime one gallon of boiling 
water. Let it stand two days, stir- 
ring it occasionally ; then pour it 
clear off, and bottle it for use. When 
required, add half a pint to a quart 
or three pints of cold spring water. 
Wash your clothes well, and rinse it 
from the soap ; then put it into the 
above, and let it steep for a few hours ; 
pass it through clean water, and you 
will find the colour much improved. 

Borax used in Washing. 

Quarter of a pound of refined 
borax to five gallons of water ; pow- 
der the borax ; dissolve it in boiling 
water in the above proportion, and 
use. It is an excellent bleacher, and 
may be used for the most delicate 
laces even ; it also saves soap. 

A little pipeclay dissolved in the 
hot water cleans very dirty linen with 
half the soap required without it. 

To Remove Ironmoulds. 

Wet the spot ; lay it over a hot 
water plate, or strain it over a basin 
with hot water in it ; put a little salts 
of lemon on the spot ; wash it as 
soon as the spot is removed. 

To take out Mildew. 

Mix soft-soap, powdered starch, 
half as much salt, and the juice of a | 
lemon. Paint both sides of the linen ! 



with a brush ; put it out on the grass 
till the stain comes out. 

Clothes Lines. 

Gutta-percha clothes lines are 
stronger and much more durable 
than common cord. They can, more- 
over, be cleaned, and are not affected 
by wet. When the clothes line is 
done with, a little hot water will con- 
vert the material into a soap-bowl. 

To Eemove Wine-stains from Linen. 

Hold them in milk that is boiling 
on the fire, and they will soon dis~ 
appear. 

To Clean White Veils. 

Make a solution of white soap ; 
let the veil simmer in it for a quarter 
of an hour ; squeeze in warm water 
and soap till it is clean ; rinse it in 
cold water, in which put a drop of 
blue water. 

Pour boiling water on a teaspoon- 
ful of starch ; run the veil through 
this, and clear by clapping it. Pin 
it out on a cloth or a cushion, very 
evenly, by the edges to dry. 

To Remove Stains made by Acids. 

Wet the spots and lay on them 
some salt of sorrel, rub it, but do 
not wet it again. Then wash it 
out. 

(See also Linen Closet.) 

To Wash Coloured Prints, Cretonnes, etc. 

Put a little bran into lukewarm 
water ; wash quickly through ; rinse 
in cold water also quickly. Hang 
to dry in a room without fire or 
sunshine. Iron with not too hot an 
iron. Use no soap. 

The colour of mauve or violet 
may be preserved by putting a little 
soda in the water. Green can be 
kept by putting alum in the water ; 
ox-gall also preserves the colours. 
But if coloured prints continue wet 
too long, nothing can save the 



44 



Fuel. 



colours from running. They must 
be done quickly and not let lie in 
the water. 

To Render Muslin, Lace, and Net 
Incombustible. 

Mix with the starch half its weight 
of whiting. It answers also for 
lace flounces. 

Or: — Dissolve half an ounce of 
sal-ammoniac in the rinsing water. 

Alum also answers the purpose. 

Substitute for Soap. 

The sawdust of pine and fir trees 
will do quite as well as soap for 
washing coarse linen. 

To render Muslins Uninflammable. 

Tungstate of soda, prepared ex- 
pressly for rendering fabrics non- 
inflammable, can be obtained by 
order, of any chemist for about is. 
per pound. Directions for use : To 
three parts of dry starch add one 
part of tungstate of soda, and use 
the starch in the ordinary way. If 
the material does not require starch- 
ing, mix in the proportions of one 



pound of tungstate of soda to two 
gallons of water ; well saturate the 
fabric with this solution, and dry it. 
The heat of the iron in no way 
affects the non-inflammability. Or, 
dip in a solution of chloride of zinc. 

"Washing Blonde. 

For Blonde use fine soap, very 
slightly ; wash it gently in water in 
which a little stone blue is dis- 
solved ; when clean, dry it ; then 
dip it in thin gum water ; dry it 
again in linen, and iron it flat ; if 
washed finally in water in which a 
lump of sugar is dissolved, it will 
have the face of new blonde. 

To Wash Lace. 

Dissolve some salts of tartar in 
hot water. Put in the lace, and let 
it remain to soak for about half an 
hour. Then take it out of the water, 
and squeeze it dry. 

The salts of tartar must be used 
when bought to prevent them melt- 
ing away. 

Blonde net or tulle may be washed 
in the same manner. 



FUEL. 

COALS— COKE— WOOD— CHARCOAL. 



Coal is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, 
besides the mineral substances which remain in the ash. 

Wood contains the same elements, with the exception of sulphur and 
nitrogen. 

Newcastle coal is considered the best, as it burns without making any 
dust and leaves very little residue ; but it requires to be stirred often, or 
it cakes and goes out. 

Silkstone is a good burner with a very little ash. 

Brooch coal burns very brilliantly, and leaves almost no ash. It will 
burn to the last fragment. It is considered, from its rapid combustion, 
a very expensive coal. 

Anthracite is fit only for hall stoves. 

The very cheap coal lately sold in London at 17s. per ton is of use 
only in the kitchen, as it makes so much dust that it quite destroys the 
furniture. 

Coal contains a certain amount of water, some more, some less ; it is 
therefore most economical to buy it in the hot dry weather, when the 



Matches. 345 



water having exuded, the weight will be that of coal, not coal and water. 
Moreover, coal is sold much more cheaply in the summer than in the 
winter, the demand for it being less. 

The price varies with the seasons and the locality. 

Wood makes a cheerful, clean, and pleasant fire, but it is seldom — we 
may say never— burnt alone in our country. It heats ovens better than 
any other fuel. Joined to coal it makes the best fire imaginable, and 
we believe (in contradiction to the received opinion) that good hard 
chumps of wood save the coals. Fir apples, or the cones of the fir tree, 
make a wonderfully bright and pretty fire, added to the coals. 

Coke is a preparation of coal, or, rather, the refuse of coal when gas 
has been extracted from it. It burns clearly and without a flame and 
gives out a great heat, and saves coal when broken into very small pieces 
and added to the fire. It can be used by itself in close stoves, but will 
not burn alone in an open grate. It is of use in the kitchen grate from 
its power of heat when in a thorough state of combustion. In the 
drawing room it is objected to on account of its peculiar vapoury smell ; 
still, for people of small means, it is a saving. Packing the cinders at 
the back of the grate and putting on small coal, slightly moistened, also 
economizes coal. A ton of coals should make one fire for seven weeks. 

Charcoal is wood burnt to mere carbon, the hydrogen and oxygen 
having been expelled from it. It is used only in stoves for the more 
delicate kinds of cooking. It should never be burned in bedrooms, as it 
gives off nearly pure carbonic acid gas, which is a deadly poison, and 
which causes drowsiness, lethargy, and death. 

Cooking by gas is considered economical. 

Wood for lighting fires is sold in bundles. A bundle used with skill 
will light three fires. Wheels made of resined wood are sold for the same 
purpose at \d. each, and ignite very rapidly ; but this fact renders them 
dangerous to keep in the house, for fear of their igniting by accident. 

Matches. 

But little more than a quarter of a century ago every housewife saved 
her linen rags to make tinder ; now they are saved to make paper. 
Brimstone-tipped matches sold in a bunch, but spread out like a fan, 
were at that time sold in the streets by poor match-girls, a class as 
peculiar then as the boys with their " box o' lights" are now. What a 
change has the lucifer produced ! The trouble of getting a light years 
ago can only be well understood by those who then used flint and steel. 
At length the great discoveries of Sir Humphry Davy in chemistry 
became known. Phosphorus became of commercial importance as a 
light-bearer. There were other discoveries of great use, particularly that 
of chlorate of potash. Phosphoric matches were soon reduced in price 
from five shillings a hundred to sixpence for the same quantity. Finally, 
by various improvements in their manufacture they were reduced to their 
present price. It was in 1842 that Mr. Reuben Partridge obtained his 
patent for making splints, without which only half progress could have 
been made in the cheap manufacture of matches. Kraft, the discoverer 
of phosphorus, travelled through Europe, and was received at various 
courts to show his inventions. Schrotter, the great Austrian chemist of

Vienna, discovered in 1845 a method of rendering phosphorus less com- 
bustible than it is in its ordinary state, yet quite as efficient as a source 
of light. To this discovery we owe the present popular matches which 
light only on the box, as Bryant and May's do. 

To Extinguish a Fire* 

A solution of 5 ounces of ammonia in 1 gallon of water will extinguish

THE STABLE-YARD AND 
OCCUPANTS. 



ITS 



Of all animals destined for the use of man the horse is the most useful 
and profitable, as he is the most noble, generous, and patient, conducing 
most to our profit, pleasure, and sport, notwithstanding the abuse, ill- 
treatment, and overwork to which he is subjected by the thoughtless, the 
ignorant, and cruel. Thanks to the Society for the Prevention.of Cruelty 
to Animals, and the highly advanced state of civilization in this country, 
much is daily being done to better and improve the condition of the 
horse and of all other animals ; still very much remains to be done. It is 
therefore both the duty and interest of every man possessing a horse to 
see that he is properly stabled, carefully groomed, fed, and shod, and that 
he purchases one suitable and fitted for the work required of him. 

Stable. 

Every one will prefer to have the stables near his house, if not on his 
own premises ; in either case, if they are already built, he must do the

Aspect. — Drain age. 



best he can with them. Old buildings are for the most part very defective, 
badly drained, and badly ventilated. This must at once be remedied, and 
may generally be done at a moderate expense, which will be amply repaid 
by the improved health and comfort of the horses. New stables are 
better, but they also frequently require alteration. 




Ground Plan of a Stable. 
A. Drains. 

For the guidance and assistance of those proposing to build their own 
stables, subjoined are some plain, useful remarks on the building, drain- 
ing, and ventilating, and also some plans for the arrangement of the 
stalls and boxes, and designs for stable fittings, selected from the catalogue 
of the St. Pancras Iron Works Company, where fittings and articles of 
stable furniture will be found, both for quality and moderate charges, 
equal to any in London. These plans can be varied and enlarged accord- 
ing to circumstances. 



Aspect. 

When about to build a stable, the first consideration will naturally be 
the selection cf a site. We need not insist on the advantages of a 
southerly aspect, they are almost self-evident. The stables will be much 
more cheerful, and much warmer, and enable the groom to avail himself 
of every gleam of sunshine to open the windows and thoroughly ventilate 
the interior. 

Unfortunately it is not alwrys possible, from the disposition of the 
ground and premises, to manage this. However, let it be borne in mind 
that such is the best, the west the next best, and the north-east the very 
worst. 

It should not be forgotten, also, that a thorough drainage is one of the 
most important points, and every natural slope of the land should be 
taken advantage of in this respect. 



Drainage- -Sewers, 349 



Drainage. 

Having settled the site and the plans of the stables, to which we will 
refer further on, the first works to be provided for will be the drainage, for 
these will have to be carried out simultaneously with the foundations. 
The drains will be of two sorts, which should be kept as far away from one 
another as it is possible to manage, — first, those connected with the 
drainage of the interior of the stables ; second, those intended to carry 
away the surface water and collect the rain-water from the roofs, &c. 

Sewers. 

There are four conditions which are to be regarded as indispensable in 
the construction of all drains from all buildings whatsoever. These con- 
ditions are : — Firstly, that the entire length of drain is to be constructed 
and maintained with sufficient declivity towards the discharge into the cess- 
pools to enable the average proportion and quantity of liquid and solid 
matters committed to it to maintain a constant and iminterrupted motion, 
so that stagnation shall never occur. Secondly, that the entire length of 
the drain is to be constructed and maintained in a condition of complete 
impermeability, so that no portion of the matters put into it shall 
accidentally escape from it. Thirdly, that the head of the drain shall be 
so efficiently trapped that no gaseous or volatile properties or products can 
possibly arise from its contents. And, fourthly, that the low extremity of 
the drain or point of communication with the cesspool shall be so completely 
and durably formed, that no interruption to the flow of the drainage or 
escape shall there take place, and that no facility shall be offered for the 
upward progress of the sewage in case of the cesspool becoming sur- 
charged. 

For most purposes a fall of two and a half inches in ten feet will be 
sufficient, and the drain should be of three inch glazed stoneware pipes 
(four inches for w.c), with carefully made socket-joints laid in the 
direction of the current, and cemented. For the head of the drain we 
would recommend the bell-trapped horse pots, which are to be had at all 
stable furnishing ironmongers, taking care that they are sufficiently large 
and of good strong quality. 





The cesspool for sewerage should be well away from the tank provided 
for the reception of the rain-water, and well puddled with clay on the 
outside and cemented inside. Precaution should also be further taken 
that all sewage drains should be laid below the rain-w r ater drains, so that 
in case of any accidental defects no matter will by any possibility taint 
the water supply. (See Plan No. I.) 



35° 



Rain-water Drains. 



Plan No. I. 




Rain-water Drains. 

These will subdivide themselves into two, those laid to collect the 
drainage of yard, &c, and which may be common pipes laid dry, and 
leading to an ordinary cesspool made of bricks laid without mortar, where 
the water will collect and gradually lose itself; the others connected 
with the down pipes from roofs and leading to a rain-water tank. These 
should be laid with the same care as the sewer drains, the tank con- 
structed in the same way with an overflow pipe to lead to cesspool just 
mentioned. 



Buildings — Materials — Plans. 



35i 



Buildings. 

Having determined upon the site for the stables, the next point to study 
will be the general arrangement of the plan, and the materials for construction. 

Materials. 

As to the materials, economy will dictate that preference should be 
given to those supplied by the immediate neighbourhood ; and we should 
advise that where a professional architect is not employed, the builder be 
required to make a drawing and a specification of the works which he 
will perform for the named price. Also, that all the requirements should 
as much as possible be foreseen, so that afterwards no alterations be made 
in the building, as otherwise it will be impossible to determine the limit 
of the cost. Should the estimated price come to a higher sum than was 
anticipated, we should not recommend to attempt to get the builder to 
take something off the amount, as he will only do so by scamping the 
work ; but premising that he is a respectable and well-recommended man, 
we should advise that the extent of the building be reduced in preference 
to the quality of the work. Cheap work and cheap materials are always 
the dearest in the end. 

Plans. 

The plan of the building will vary very much according to the aspect.

disposition of land and other premises, and 
other local circumstances. These should be 
very carefully studied, and the plans well 
matured, as the success of the building will 
greatly depend on the disposition of its various 
parts. We will lay down as one of the first 
principles, that no stall should be less than 
six feet wide by ten feet long, no loose box 
less than ten feet square, and no stable less 
than ten feet high from floor to ceiling. Pas- 
sage in rear of stalls, five feet wide. 

Such arrangement as will put all the 
horses' heads the same way, with the light 
and ventilation behind them, will be the 
most preferable, as enabling the doors and 
windows to be opened without placing the 
horses in a draught. (See Plan No. 2.) 

The doors should be wide and high, and 
hung in two heights, with fanlight over (four __ 
feet by seven feet at least), that the horses 
may go in and out freely without a chance of 
knocking themselves about. One often sees 
a horse hesitating before entering a stable ; and 
when after a little coaxing he is persuaded to 
come on, he will do so with a rush. Such a 
horse has no doubt, at some time or other, 
hurt himself when passing through a door either 
too narrow or too low. 

The light should be full, as tending greatly 
to the cheerfulness of the interior. It is also 
well known that horses who work in darkness, 
such as those in the mines, eventually become 
blind. Their sight, therefore, must be to some 
extent affected by the quantity of light which 
they enjoy. The sashes also should be hung on 
centres in their height, as the most advantageous 
method for ventilation. 



Ventilation. 

To complete the ventilation, the only further 
requirements will be an opening in the ceiling — 
not immediately over the horses, but in the 
rear over the passage, fitted with an orna- 
mental ventilating grating, to be shut and open 
at will, leading to an air-flue laid between the 
joists, and conducting the foul air from the 
stables to the outside through an ornamental 
perforated air brick or iron grating. A similar ventilating grating, to

regulate the admission of fresh air, will only be necessary where the doors 
and windows are small, and fit very accurately. 

Paving. 

The materials for paving should be of the hardest quality, on good 
sound ballast or concrete foundation. Any absorbent materials must be 
rejected— first, because they will not be of sufficient durability ; and, 
secondly, because from their nature they will retain part of the manure, 
and the stables will never be sweet. The paving of boxes and stalls 

should be laid with a 
regular gentle slope to 
the drain, which should 
always be in the centre. 
Irrespective of other 
advantages, the horses 
stand on the level, and 
take their rest more com- 
fortably. 

An occasional sprink- 
ling of gypsum (sulphate 
of lime), when cleaning 
the stables, will be found 
to act as a great purifier. 
Its great affinity for am- 
monia causes it to ab- 
sorb a great quantity of the 
gases generated in the 
stables, which will thereby 
lose all their offensive smell, 
and none of the ammonia 
will be lost, but will be re- 
tained in a condition ser- 
viceable as manure. 

Partitions. 

The partition for stalls 

will be match-lined both 

sides, and about four feet 

two inches high in rear, with a ramp and rising to six feet two inches 

towards the mangers ; with iron pillar at the end next passage, with 

rings for pillar reins. Sometimes also the match-lining will be carried

through in a level line, and the ramp formed by a cast-iron ornamental 
panel. 




For loose boxes the boarding will be from five feet to about five feet 




four inches high at most, with a two-foot ornamental iron panelling 
over. 



Mangers. — Harness Room. 



355 




Mangers. 

The best mangers are those containing hay-rack, corn manger, and 
water-trough in one, as per sketch ; and we more specially recommend 

that preference 







should be given to 
galvanized iron. 

The wall over 
the manger should 
be match-boarded 
to the height of 
partitions, and 
lined with iron 
hoop bands, sheet 
zinc over the joints 
of match-lining, or 
enamelled tiles, to 
prevent horses biting at it when 
being cleaned. 

The manger will have two rings 
for halter reins, and a ring and gal- 
vanized chain fitted in wall over 
same. 

Harness Boom. 

This should be at least ten feet 
square, and have in it a fireplace 
fitted with range with boiler attach- 
ed. A handy supply of hot water 
will be found most advantageous 
in the management of the stables, 
and we need not point out the necessity of a fire for drying the rugs, 
horse-cloths, saddles, harness, &c, in winter time. 

This room should be fitted with convenient hooks and brackets for the

hanging and cleaning of harness. These are of all sorts of designs, in 
which individual taste will be the best guide. 

Coach-House. 

In the arrangement of the coach-house care should be taken that it 
be so situated that it have a long front to the yard, so that the carriages 
may be housed side by side, and not one behind the other ; each carriage 
to have its doors, so that any particular carriage can be run in or run out 
without disturbing any of the others. When this is not practicable, the 
coach-house must be of sufficient depth to allow of two carriages standing 
one behind the other, with a space of at least eighteen inches between 
them. 

Hay Loft and Corn Chamber. 

In most stables, in addition to the coachman's rooms, there is a corn 
chamber and hay-loft over the stable. The former is generally boarded 
off, lined all round with sheets of zinc or tin to keep out the vermin, and 
the door is provided with a lock, of which the coachman keeps the key, 
and gives out at stated times the corn for so many horses for so many 
days. By this means he keeps a check upon the consumption, and pre- 
vents waste and pilfering ; both of which are more likely to occur when 
the supply is unlimited and easy of access. When there is not a regular 
corn chamber, one must either be made or a large bin provided, and the 
oats brought from the corn chandler as required, in quantities of two or 
three quarters at a time, as many as the bin will contain, which will be 
found a more expensive proceeding. Hay, from being bulky, is almost 
invariably stowed away in the loft, which should hold at least half a load ; 
it must be stored away carefully, and nothing allowed to run about or 
play on it. Hay will keep good and sweet for some time, if in a dry place 
and not meddled with. If the loft be large enough it will be found better 
and cheaper to buy a load at a time ; if not, or the loft be damp, a smaller 
quantity must suffice. 

Stable Utensils. 

Under this head is included all that is used in dressing the horse, and 
in cleansing the yard and stable. 

The pitchfork is used to shake up the straw, of which the horses' bed is 
made ; to remove all that becomes soiled and dirty ; and, in general, to 
set it fair and straight. The handle should be kept clean, and the prongs 
bright. Price is. 

The shovel removes the smaller particles, and the scrapings of the 
stable yard. Price 2s. 6a 7 . 

The besom or broom is used to sweep out the stable after the damp 
soiled litter has been removed, and to keep the yard neat and clean. 
Those made of birch are the best, and are bought at about gs. a dozen, 
according to the quality and locality. 

A manure basket to take up the droppings. This should be done before 
trodden about, to keep the straw clean, and the stable sweet. Price 2s. 

The stable pail should be made of strong oak, bound with iron, and 
neatly painted. Cost, from 5.9. to 6s. each. 

A sieve, to cleanse the oats and chaff of all dust and small stones. 
Price 2s. 6d> 



Clothing, &*c. 357 



A quartern and a half-quartern measure to measure out the oats, 
beans, chaff, &c. for each horse's feed. About is. 6d. each. 

The currycomb. — Horses of the present day are so much better bred 
than formerly, consequently their coats and skin are so much finer, there 
is now much less use for the currycomb, except to remove the dust from 
the body brush. On very rough-coated horses it may occasionally be 
used, but no other should ever be touched with it. In summer it is abso- 
lutely unnecessary, and in these days of clipping and singeing, in the 
winter it is almost equally so. It must always be used lightly, or it will 
severely punish the horse, and on no account should the teeth be sharp, 
or more than the eighth of an inch in length. Price i s. 6d. 

The body brush, or horse brush as it is sometimes called, is, in the 
hands of a good groom, the most useful implement used in dressing the 
horse, as it thoroughly removes all dust and dirt, stimulates the skin, and 
imparts a gloss to the coat. Cost, about 5s. 

The water brush is to wash all dirt and mud from the feet and legs of 
the horse, and stains from his quarters, &c. Price 4s. 

The mane comb, as the name implies, is to comb the mane and tail. 
It should be made of horn, have large teeth, and be used carefully and 
only occasionally, as in a general way a good brushing will answer the 
purpose without pulling out the hair. Cost, is. 

Tlie picker is a blunt iron hook for removing the grit and stones 
from the horse's feet. Some are made to fold up for the pocket. A good, 
careful groom will always carry one of these. Price is. 6d. 

A sponge, too, is always necessaiy to dry the legs, &c, after washing, 
and for other purposes of cleanliness. Price varies according to place 
and quality. 

Leathers and rubbers are also indispensable for drying the horse after 
work, and wiping him over after dressing. 

An oil-brush and tin to hold the oil, and to rub round the hoofs before 
leaving the stable to go to work. 

A wooden box for holding the stopping. Price 2s. 

A singeing lamp and a pair of trimming scissors are also necessary. 
Price of former about 10s., and of the latter $s. 

To avoid loss and confusion, there should be a place for everything, 
and everything in its place, and all the utensils should be kept bright and 
clean. 

Clothing, &c. 

Every horse standing in a stable must have a head collar with two 
reins long enough to go through the two rings fastened to the manger, 
and to reach the ground after being each attached to a weight or block 
made of hard wood or iron heavy enough to keep the reins from twisting 
or curling up, but not so heavy as to be a weight or strain upon the horse's 
head as he moves it. When in a box, too, a head collar is always handy 
on the quietest horse ; on a tricky or unruly animal it is absolutely neces- 
sary, as he can then be at any time easily secured without risk or trouble. 

Halters. — Two good web-headed hempen halters are also requisite in 
every stable, to lead the horse about without having to use the head 
collar. 

Clothing. — There is a great variety of clothing, from the comparatively 



35 8 Advice as to how to Purchase a Horse. 

inexpensive to the most expensive in make and finish. These consist of 
blankets or rugs of different degrees of warmth and thickness according 
to the time of year, a roller, a suit of body clothing, and a set of flannel 
bandages. The best material will be the cheapest in the end, as wearing 
so much longer than the cheaper kinds. 

The blanket or rug should be cut back at the top of the shoulder, with 
a projecting piece on each side coming round and meeting in the centre 
of the chest, where they fasten with a buckle and strap. Each rug, too, 
should be bound with some strong material to prevent the edges tearing 
out. Two rugs will be found necessary for each horse. 

A suit of body clothing may be made of various materials, but strong 
warm serge is best for winter, and a lighter kind for summer wear. It 
consists of a quarter-piece, hood and breast-piece, with roller to match. 
The roller must be well padded, to prevent bruising or injury to the back 
from pressure. 

In winter, in a warm stable, a heavy rug and the body clothing will be 
found sufficient during the day, but at night the latter should be removed 
to keep it clean, and another rug substituted. 

The flaii7iel bandages are put on after the horse has had his legs washed, 
to keep them dry and warm. They are also of great service in illness, to 
keep up the circulation and warmth in the extremities. In hunting 
stables, where the horses must be occasionally sweated, it will be necessary 
to have two or three spare rugs and hoods in use for that purpose, and 
which should be carefully washed and dried. The price of clothing 
varies so much according to the quality and finish, it is difficult to 
name any, but a respectable saddler will at any time give an estimate for 
the kind required. 

ADVICE AS TO HOW TO PURCHASE A HORSE. 

To the inexperienced the purchase of a horse is a matter of some 
little difficulty and risk, and the object of this treatise is to throw out 
some few hints to enable the intending purchaser to ascertain first what 
sort of horse he requires (not always an easy task), then the best and 
safest way to buy him, and the best and most economical way to preserve 
' him in health and condition to perform the duties required of him. 

And first I must caution all purchasers against a very common fault- 
that of wanting, and expecting to find perfection in any horse ; there is no 
such thing either in man or horse ; all that can be done is to select one as 
nearly as possible approaching the standard required. As in everything, 
" a little knowledge is a dangerous thing ;' ; it is particularly so in all 
relating to the purchase and management of the horse. The inexperienced 
purchaser should therefore place himself either in the hands of an expe- 
rienced friend, or respectable dealer, and unless he knows something of an 
animal previously, be very cautious in purchasing at the sales by auction, 
or from advertisements, however flatteringly described, and seemingly fair 
in allowing trials &c. The great demand for horses, both at home and 
abroad, during the last few years has raised the price at least fifty per 
cent., and in some classes to even more than that. 

There are several highly respectable dealers in London, and generally 
one at least in most large towns in the country, to whom an intending 



Advice as to how to Purchase a Horse. 359 



purchaser may apply, and who, on his stating the sort of horse he re- 
quires, and the ' purpose for which he requires him, will show him some 
from which he may make a selection, — the dealer guaranteeing the 
horses to be sound and quiet to ride or drive, &c. As so much difference 
of opinion exists as to what constitutes soundness or unsoundness in 
horses, most dealers of the present day decline to warrant any horse sound, 
but allow the purchaser to have him examined by any veterinary surgeon 
he may select, whose certificate that he is sound at the time of purchase 
exonerates the dealer from all responsibility in that respect. Most horses 
purchased out of a dealer's stable are fat and short of work, and at first 
care is requisite that they be used carefully and steadily, and brought to 
work by degrees, or illness may probably result to the horse and dis- 
appointment to the owner ; the dealer not unfrequently getting the blame 
for what arises, not from any fault of his, but from a want of knowledge 
or care on the part of the owner in too soon putting him to work for which 
he was not yet fit, and the ill effects of which a little care, a few days' 
patience, and a mild dose of physic would have prevented. 

In his choice of a horse the purchaser will of course be guided by 
whether he wants one for riding or driving purposes ; if for the former he 
will be particular that the shoulder lies well back, and if strong, not loaded 
at the top or points — that he has a good back, deep body, clean, flat, wiry- 
looking legs, and free from large splints, curbs, spavins, &c. ; that his feet 
are firm and of moderate size — neither large and flat, and therefore neces- 
sarily weak, nor strong and narrow like those of a mule. When a horse 
has natural feet of the latter description they are generally remarkably 
sound, and will stand a great deal of work ; but, as a rule, that shape is 
produced by internal disease, rendering the horse unsound when put to 
work. 

If for driving purposes, he need not be so particular about the 
shoulders ; for harness they may be stronger, heavier, and more upright, 
as many make capital harness horses that are, from their formation, very 
uncomfortable to ride. 

Having met with one suitable for his purpose, the purchaser must not 
let a few pounds prevent him buying him, if rather more than the price to 
which he had proposed to go. For instance, an intending purchaser 
limits himself to price, say jot. ; he sees one the very thing he wants for a 
few pounds more, but declines to go beyond his fixed price. He even- 
tually buys one he thinks may suit at about his price ; after a time, finding 
he will not do, he changes him away for another as unlikely to suit him, 
paying 10/. or 15/. more, simply to get rid of the first. This again is 
changed away in his turn, and so on, till at last he finds himself still 
unsuited, with one, that altogether, after the different changes and pay- 
ments, costs him nearly double the price of that he declined at first as 
being beyond his figure. 

Horses are for the most part unfit for the London market, and for 
general use, till they are at least five years old ; but a dealer will occasion- 
ally buy a good one at four years old, if at a corresponding price. Some 
men, and often young men, fond of riding, cannot afford to give a high 
price for a horse for their own use. He has either to put up with an 
unsound or a blemished one. But if his work is not hard, and he is a pretty 
fair horseman, he would find it advantageous to buy a good four-years old 



360 The Hack, or Riding Horse — The Ladies' Horse, 

and use him gently for a year, when, if all went well, he would have a 
good horse at a cheaper rate. A man must understand something about 
horses and their management to do this to advantage. 

The Hack, or Hiding Horse. 

In selecting a riding horse much must depend upon the size and 
weight of the rider. The best and most useful size is from I5hds. to 
I5hds. 2in. The most fashionable colours are bay, brown, and dark 
chestnut. A really good riding horse, with good action and fine manners, 
is very difficult to find, as he must be good-looking, well-made, sound, 
and temperate, with breeding substance, action, and courage. His head 
should be lean, the eye bold and prominent, the muzzle small, with large 
nostrils. The neck should be good and slightly arched to bend to the 
bridle, shoulders lie well back and strong, but not heavy and loaded at 
the points, the body deep and round, strong back and loin, with good 
deep quarters and good firm legs and feet. He must ride lightly in hand, 
walk pleasantly and safely, trot freely, with good action, and canter easily, 
yielding to the bit without pulling. He must carry the saddle well back 
behind the shoulders ; nothing is so uncomfortable or looks so badly in 
any description of riding horse as sitting on the top of the shoulders 
instead of behind them. The price will vary according to his action, 
manners, and appearance, as well as the weight he can carry. From 35/. 
or 40/. for the light blood hack with low action, to 70/. or 80/. for good 
useful sorts, and up to 150/. to 200/., or even more, for first-class horses 
of great style and manners, with very grand action. Many horses of this 
class are very fast, and can trot up to twelve and fourteen miles an hour; 
but if they do seven or eight miles pleasantly and well, they will be fast 
enough, as few men care to ride faster. 

The great defects to be avoided in purchasing a riding horse are a 
loose weak neck — horses so formed invariably getting their heads up, and 
being very uncomfortable to ride ; low upright shoulders ; and twisted 
fore legs — rendering the horse liable to hit either the inside of the knee 
or fetlock joint, which is very dangerous and likely to cause him to fall. 
A shy, nervous horse, too, should be avoided, as well as a hot, irritable one. 
Horses of a light chestnut colour are very often so, and in company will 
not settle into any pace. Ten miles is a fair average day's work. The 
expense of keep, shoeing, &c, will average 30^. a week for one, but where 
two or more are kept it will decrease in proportion. 

The Ladies' Horse. 

A perfect ladies' horse is of all descriptions the most difficult to find. 
So many good qualities, which, though desirable in all riding horses, 
may be overlooked in those for men, are here absolutely essential. Fine 
temper and courage, a light level mouth, and fine manners, are indispen- 
sable. He should be from i5hds. to I5hds. 3m. high, with a good head 
and neck, fine oblique shoulders, rather long in the body, with a good 
back and loin, deep strong quarters, firm sound legs and feet. If the 
hind legs are rather bent, so much the better ; he will get them more 
under him, and consequently his paces will be easier — horses with 
straight hind legs invariably pitching most unpleasantly in the canter, 



The Hunter. 



which must be easy and elegant. As few ladies ride more than from ten 
to eleven stone, including a nineteen or twenty-pound saddle, and ease 
and lightness in action are indispensable, the ladies' horse should be very 
nearly thorough-bred, if not quite so. He must walk well and freely, step 
lightly but sharply in the trot, with a rather long easy canter. He must 
be high couraged and free, but at the same time docile and temperate. 
A slow, lazy horse is as objectionable and disagreeable to ride as a hot, 
irritable one. The latter will sometimes go quietly and temperately in 
the hands of a lady, though irritable and fidgety when ridden by men, 
owing to the easier, lighter pull on their mouths. From the position of 
the ladies' seat and from the great length and incumbrance of the habit, 
it follows they cannot have the same power and control over the horse 
that men have, and accidents to them are more likely to be attended with 
dangerous results ; hence greater care is necessary in selecting a horse for 
their use free from all tricks, nervousness, and vice. 

Many are called good ladies' horses that have no other recommenda- 
tion than their being very quiet, which with very many will cover a multi- 
tude of faults. 

A few years since ladies rode no pace but the walk and canter, but 
lately the trot has become a favourite and fashionable pace ; consequently 
a safe, sharp, easy trot is now essential in all horses to carry a lady. 

The ladies' hunter differs in some respects from the riding horse for 
the road or park ; he may be less showy and stronger. He must be 
eight or nine years old, have been well and regularly ridden to hounds for 
at least two or three seasons, and thoroughly understand his business ; 
not less than I5hds. 2in. or more than i6hds. high, well above the weight 
he has to carry, well-bred and fast, but thoroughly quiet and temperate 
among other horses, and at his fences, which he should take freely and 
cleverly, go well into the bridle without pulling, and turn readily with a 
motion of the hand. 

A hot, irritable, fretful brute, or one with a weak, loose neck is uncom- 
fortable enough for a man to ride, but it is absolutely dangerous to allow 
any lady to ride such a one on the road — to say nothing of riding him to 
hounds — however good he may be represented to be. 

The best colours for ladies' horses are bay, brown, dark chestnut, or 
black. There is an old saying, that " A good horse cannot be a bad 
colour ;" and though no purchaser should decline to buy one that is likely 
to suit him on account of colour, those I have named are to be preferred. 

The price of horses differs so greatly, and depends so much on their 
make, style, and qualifications, that it is difficult to name an average one ; 
but a good ladies' horse, either for the road or the field, is always worth 
from ioo/. to 150/. 

The Hunter. 

In selecting a hunter it is necessary to bear in mind the country in 
which he is to be ridden. In the grass countries of Leicestershire, North- 
amptonshire, &c, the hunter must be nearly if not quite thoroughbred : 
the enclosures being large, the fences strong, and the scent over the grass 
good, nothing but blood can go the pace and keep on jumping. The 
reason is this : when going with hounds the thoroughbred is never really 
extended, but is always going within himself, while the half-bred is going 



The Hunter. 



all the time at the top of his pace, and necessarily becomes much sooner 
exhausted. 

In a close country, on the contrary, the half-bred hunter is preferred. 
The pace is not so fast, and the horse is constantly eased by being pulled 
up and steadied at the fences ; for it is a well-known fact that fences stop 
hounds more than they do horses. In countries of this description, as 
Essex, Herts, Surrey, &c, the land is generally ploughed, wet, and heavy, 
the enclosures are smaller, and the fences being principally bank and 
ditch, must be taken steadily and carefully. I have seen some quite 
common half-bred horses go remarkably well over a close country that 
could not live for five minutes over the grass countries. 

The points essential to a hunter are a lean head and neck, well set on 
to good oblique shoulders, a strong back and loin, wide hips, a deep 
body and back ribs, good muscular quarters, and gaskins well let down to 
the hocks, and clean, firm legs and feet. He must be temperate, with 
plenty of courage, and have a good mouth and manners. His size will 
vary from I5hds. iin. to i6hds. 2in., according to the weight he has to 
carry and the description of country he has to cross. From I5hds. 
3in. to i6hds. 2in. is perhaps the best size for the flying grass countries, 
while from I5hds. iin. to I5hds. 3m. will be found better and handier for 
the close deep country. 

The Irish hunter is very much improved of late years. From the 
importation into Ireland of some of the best-bred English stallions, they 
have lost a good deal of the mean appearance they formerly had, are better- 
bred, and better-looking, with deeper and longer quarters. The Irish 
horse had generally a small neat head, oblique but rather weak shoulders, 
short back ribs, and mean, drooping quarters — all which has been very 
much improved, and some very first-class horses are now bred in Ireland. 
They are generally very clever, particularly good timber-jumpers, better 
adapted perhaps for the close heavy countries than the grass. When 
honest and good-tempered, they are very pleasant to ride, but from often 
being tricky and shifty require care in purchasing. The price of the 
hunter depends very much on his breed, appearance, manners, and ability. 
For the grass countries it would vary from 100/. to 300/., and for the 
close plough countries from 80/. to 200/. 

The amount of work that may be fairly expected of a hunter is one 
day a week with staghounds and three days a fortnight with foxhounds. 
From being particularly liable to accidents from blows, thorns, over- 
reaches, &c, it will generally be found that out of a stud of four, one will 
be " hors de combat." The best and hardiest colours are bay, brown, dark 
chestnut, and black. Light chestnuts are very often hot and irritable, and 
also bad feeders when put to work. Horses with short back ribs, too, are 
almost invariably bad feeders. 

Hunters go in all forms, but a loose, weak neck and twisted fore-legs 
are always to be avoided. The former is the most dangerous fault a 
hunter can have : it is impossible to steady him at his fences or in any 
way interfere with his mouth, without his at once throwing up his head ; 
consequently he cannot see where he is going, and serious falls are the 
result. With twisted fore-legs, the horse is liable to hit and cut himself 
under the knee, and on the fetlock joint, resulting in lameness and 
swelling, even if he do not fall. 



363 

The Carriage Horse, 

These horses are bred principally in Yorkshire and the North of Eng- 
land, are bought there by the principal dealers and jobmasters at three 
and four years old, are broken, driven, and matched by them for some 
time before they are fit for the carriages of the nobility and gentry. 
Carriage horses are always either bay or brown, those without white are 
preferred. They must be fully i6hds. high, with rather long rainbow 
neck, strong but oblique shoulders, deep round body, with long muscular 
quarters, carrying a good tail, clean, flat legs, and good firm feet. Being 
kept more for show than work, grand stylish appearance and action are 
indispensable, and from being generally loaded with flesh, unless the feet 
and legs are good, they will soon wear out. A pair of well-matched 
carriage horses, with style and grand action, will fetch a long price, as 
much as 600/. or 700/. being sometimes given. 

This is easily accounted for if we bear in mind the great expense, 
trouble, time, and risk that are involved in purchasing, breaking, and per- 
fecting a pair of horses of the size and style required. In fact, so great 
is the risk and so many the disappointments, that many do not buy horses 
for their carriage, but prefer hiring them of a respectable jobmaster. 
But in this, as in all other sorts and descriptions of horses, there are 
various classes, and the purchaser can suit himself, from the pair of good 
useful average horses, at about 270/., up to almost any price for first-rate 
style and action. 

The great defects to which carriage horses are liable, from their size 
and general formation, are — defect of the wind, either roaring or whistling, 
horses with long rainbow necks very frequently becoming so after a bad 
cold, or an attack of influenza. All large horses, too, are more or less 
liable to their wind becoming affected after illness. Inflammation of the 
feet is another common complaint with horses of this class. Loaded 
with flesh to improve their style and appearance, and with high action in 
addition to their weight, two great causes of inflammatory attacks, they 
are very liable to this complaint, unless great care is taken to guard 
against it. Many carriage horses, too, have flat feet, rendering them 
doubly liable to an attack of this description ; in them the sole of the foot 
will sink, becoming convex instead of concave. When such is the case 
great care is requisite in shoeing, or the horse will not beworkably sound. 

Some few years since grey was the most fashionable colour for car- 
riage horses, now bays and brown have quite superseded it for all de- 
scriptions of horses ; and unless he is very first rate, a grey horse is almost 
universally objected to. 

In hiring or jobbing carriage horses the price per month varies 
according to the time of year. For the months of May, June, and July, 
the height of the London Season, it would be about 21/. or 22/. per month 
for a pair of good-looking, useful horses. For the rest of the year it would 
vary from 16/. to not less than 12/. per month, according to the time of 
year and the value of the horses. If hired by the year the price would 
be from 90/. to 100/. for a pair of horses, and 60/. for a single horse, The 
hirer in all cases to provide fodder, &c, and to pay all expenses, as 
shoeing, &c, unless a separate agreement is entered into, when the price 
will be proportionately more. 



3^4 Horses for Light and Heavy Harness — Cobs and Ponies. 



Horses for Light Harness. 

In this class may be included horses suitable for gigs, T-carts, light 
broughams, dogcarts, &c. They should be well-bred, neck rather long 
and arched, with good back and quarters, strong oblique shoulders, carry 
a good head and tail, and be of a generally showy and stylish appearance, 
with high grand action. Horses of this description are more fitted for 
the park and for show than for real work, and command high prices. 

For general use horses of a more common description will be preferred 
— less showy, and with less action ; the better to stand the wear and tear of 
the hard roads, and must be selected according to the work required of 
them. Many of them are very fast, and can trot up to fifteen or sixteen 
miles an hour. All must have a certain amount of style and action to 
render them safe and pleasant to drive ; but as a rule, the higher and 
grander the action, the less useful is the horse for real work, the wear 
and tear of horses of this class being so great as almost to preclude them 
from all that can be called work, and they are suitable only for the park 
and show. 

The most fashionable colours arc bay, brown, chestnut, and black. 
The height will vary from I5hds. to I5hds. 3m., according to the size and 
description of carriage he has to draw, and the price will vary from 50/. to 
150/., according to style and action. 

The Horse for Heavy Harness. 

Horses for this description of work are those that have grown too large 
and coarse for carriage horses, and are used principally to run in spring 
vans by railway carriers and others requiring great strength, combined 
with a certain amount of pace, and for which the cart-horse is not adapted 
from being too slow, and from his weight and heavy action liable very soon 
to shake himself on the road when put beyond a walking pace. Another sort 
is the common, coarse, half-bred horse, too light for a cart-horse, and too 
plain and heavy for private carriages. These are generally used in 
omnibuses, for which they are admirably adapted, as from their size and 
power, as well as being for the most part active, and on short legs, they 
can draw these heavy machines, often loaded inside and out, at the rate 
of six miles an hour — which is as fast as the frequent stoppages, the 
bad foothold on the stones, and the crowded state of our streets will 
admit. 

The height of the former will be from i6hds. to I7hds. ; that of the 
latter from i5hds. 2in. to i6hds. Good useful animals of either class will 
cost from 40/. to 50/. 

COBS AND PONIES. 

The cob is a strong little horse, about I4.hds. high, and of various 
descriptions. The better class are bred principally in Norfolk or Lincoln- 
shire. When well bred and good-looking, with action, they are not only 
very useful, but very valuable for carrying heavy and elderly men, as, 
being low, they are easy to get on and off. A good cob must have a good 
head, a strong but not heavy neck, good oblique and very strong shoulders, 
not loaded at the top or points, a deep round body, good loin, and strong 
muscular quarters and thighs— short, flat, firm legs, and good round feet : 



Cobs and Ponies. 365 

Lj should walk freely and well; step sharp and high in the trot, and 
canter safely and freely ; if, in addition to these qualifications, he is quiet, 
and does not shy or stumble, he is invaluable. A great many are bred in 
Wales, but by far the best come from Norfolk, Lincolnshire, and the 
North, where much more attention is paid to breeding them, and more 
care is taken of them than in Wales, where they run wild on the hills till 
they are three or four years old, when they are sent over into England 
in droves to be sold at the different fairs and markets. 

The faults to be avoided in purchasing a cob are upright shoulders, 
want of courage, and want of action. Particular attention must be paid to 
the shoulders— that they are well-formed and oblique ; many horses of 
this class having low, upright shoulders, which renders them valueless as 
riding cobs, and useful only for harness purposes — nothing being so uncom- 
fortable and looking so ugly as riding on the top of the shoulders instead 
of well behind them, which must necessarily be the case with straight, low 
shoulders. In fact, the value of a cob depends almost entirely on his 
shoulders and action ; for whereas in the one case he would be only 
worth 30/., in the other he might be worth 120/., or even more. Some 
very fast trotting cobs are bred in Wales, but they are mostly deficient in 
style and quality, though they can go a great pace. As a rule, Welsh 
horses are much better than they appear to be : they are hardy, useful, 
and strong, and will stand a great amount of work ; and, in addition, can 
generally be bought at a price suitable for those who want a useful animal 
at a moderate price in preference to a showy and expensive one. 

The next variety we will notice is the pony ; and there are various sorts, 
or rather kinds, named after the counties and localities in which they are 
bred — as the Welsh, the Scotch, the Exmoor, New Forest, Shetland, &c. 
They are all rough, strong, and hardy animals, varying in height from 
I2hds. to I4hds., doing a great amount of hard work at a small expense for 
keep, &c. Though for the most part well bred, they are generally deficient 
about their shoulders, which are low and upright, like those of most 
ponies. They are of no value for general riding purposes, except to carry 
children, and are principally used to go in light harness, in which they 
will do an amount of work almost incredible if properly cared for. They 
are sure-footed and fast, if not overweighted, and some make first-rate 
shooting ponies ; but they rarely grow to much value. The Welsh ponies 
grow to a larger size than the other sorts I have mentioned, and in all 
there is a marked improvement of late years, owing to small, thorough- 
bred stallions having been sent into the different districts for the purpose 
of improving the breeds. The prices would vary from 15/. to 30/., 
according to circumstances, age, action, &c. 

The Shetland pony is the smallest of his class, seldom exceeding 
io|hds. high, some never growing above ojids. high. They are like dray- 
horses in miniature, are very strong, active, and hardy ; have small heads, 
good shoulders, capital backs and quarters, and from their great beauty, 
combined with general good temper and docility, are well calculated for 
the use of children. They are too small for any other purpose, except for 
drawing a small chaise. Some are very fast and enduring. I once knew 
one only iohds. high, that had trotted ten miles within the hour in 
harness. 



3^6 Defects, Diseases, and Faults in the Horse. 



Defects in the Horse, which, while they Lessen his Value, do 
not interfere with his Usefulness and Ability to Work. 

Crib-biting is a defect, or rather a bad habit (some call it unsound- 
ness), to which many men have a great objection. The horse seizes the 
top of the manger, rack, or anything he can take hold of with his teeth, 
and sucks in the wind with a grunting noise. In some it at times pro- 
duces indigestion and flatulency, but upon the generality it seems to have 
no injurious effect whatever. It is incurable, but may to a certain extent 
be stopped by buckling a strap rather tightly round the upper part of the 
neck of the horse. This strap should be removed during feeding, and 
then be replaced. I have known many very good horses crib-biters, but 
never one that it in any way affected, or stopped in his work. He should 
have plenty of good hay chaff with his corn, and but a small quantity of 
hay at a time in the rack. 

Wind-sucking is only another form of the same bad habit. In this case 
the horse sucks in the wind without taking anything between his teeth. 
Like crib-biting it is incurable, but may be checked by putting a bit called 
" a whistle" into the mouth, which must be removed during feeding, and 
then at once replaced. The whistle is formed of a hollow iron tube about 
a foot long and an inch in diameter, open at each end, with three or four 
holes at equal distances in the tube. It is put into the mouth like a bit, 
and attached to a light strap over the ears, like a bridle-head. When the 
horse sucks in the wind it enters the iron tube through the three or four 
holes, and passes out at each end, instead of going down the throat. 
Horses that are slightly blemished, either in the knees, from any accident, 
or from firing, if sound will often do a great amount of work, and can be 
bought at a reasonable price — which to a man keeping horses rather for 
work than show is often a great consideration. They are intrinsically as 
good as if unblemished, though their market value is of course greatly 
reduced. For harness purposes I should not object to a whistler ; many 
very good stylish horses are so. It is detrimental and unpleasant in a 
riding horse ; but in harness, with no weight on the back, the noise is so 
slight as to be inaudible, and does not in any way interfere with his work. 
In short, many horses are practically and workably sound that no 
veterinary surgeon would pass; and though really useful and often 
valuable, are consequently to be bought at a reduced price. 

Defects, Diseases, and Faults to be avoided in all Horses. 

A loose, weak neck. — Horses so formed are extremely unpleasant to 
ride; they get their heads up, cannot see where they are going, and it is 
impossible to feel their mouths. 

Twisted fore-legs. — Horses with this defect, when put to work, hit the 
inside of the fetlock joint, and very often under the knee as well. Both 
are highly dangerous, as the parts soon become swelled and sore, from 
repeated blows, rendering the horse liable to fall. 

Capped hocks are very unsightly, but seldom cause lameness. 

Diseased eyes, from any cause, are sure to terminate in blindness. 

Stringhalt. — Catching up one or both the hind legs. When conside- 
rable, it renders the horse very unpleasant either to ride or drive. 



Occasional Ailments of Horses. 3^7 

All bony enlargements of the joints — viz., spavin, ringbone, sidebones, 
&c, as causing lameness, very difficult and doubtful of cure. 

Laminitis, or inflammation of the laminae, generally resulting in 
pumiced or convex soles of the feet. 

Corns, unless small, as if not properly treated, they are very trouble- 
some, often causing temporary lameness, and rendering the horse cramped 
in his action, and liable to fall. 

Chronic cough. — Frequently terminates in broken wind. 

Megrims. — An attack of giddiness, more or less violent, that frequently 
attacks some horses, rendering them for the time highly dangerous. 
Since condition has been better understood, and horses are fed more on 
manger food and do not have so much hay, megrims are not so common 
as formerly. Fast free horses are more liable to it than others. The 
cause is supposed to be determination of blood to the head. 

Navicular disease. — Lameness in the navicular joint, and incurable. 

An unnerved horse, as showing the horse's feet are diseased. Many 
unnerved horses will with care do a great deal of work either on the road or 
in the field. It is a merciful operation by which many horses can work 
and move about with ease and comfort, that must otherwise have been 
destroyed, or lived in pain and misery to the end of their days. 

Roaring. — A disease of the respiratory organs, causing the horse to 
make a noise when put to any exertion. 

All enlargements of sinews a?id tendons, arising from breaking down 
or violent strains, unless the horse has been properly fired for them, and 
is intended only for light, easy work, when he may stand. 

All horses that show any sort of vice, as rearing, kicking, running 
away, being restive, and shy badly, or are vicious in the stable. Such 
animals are highly dangerous to all, but particularly so to the inex- 
perienced. 

Occasional Ailments of Horses. 

Horses are subject to various ailments arising either from accident or 
disease, too numerous to mention in a treatise of this kind. The follow- 
ing are a few of the most common. In all that are serious, or admit of 
the least doubt, it will be better at once to send for the nearest veterinary 
surgeon, as few grooms are competent to treat any but the most plain 
and simple cases. Many valuable horses have been lost or rendered use- 
less by their ignorance, that might have been saved by timely and proper 
treatment. 

Influenza is perhaps the most common and tedious complaint to which 
the horse is liable. It is an epidemic, and most prevalent in the spring. 
The symptoms at first are those of a common cold, accompanied by more 
or less fever, and great and rapid prostration of strength. The appetite 
fails, the coat looks rough and unhealthy, the throat is sore, the flanks 
heave, the breathing is laboured and accompanied by a cough, the legs 
swell, and the inside of the eyelids and nostrils is red and congested, with 
a thick yellow discharge from the latter about the third or fourth day. 
The most important part of the treatment is to keep up the strength by 
every possible means ; therefore bleeding should generally be avoided, 
and all directions of the veterinary surgeon be strictly carried out. The 
stable must be kept cool and well ventilated, but the horse kept warm 
with clothing and bandages. After a horse is pronounced pretty well 



368 Occasional Ailments oj Horses. 

again, the effects of a bad attack of influenza will often last for some time, 
and in some are never recovered. One common result is an affection of 
the wind, either roaring or whistling, both of which are incurable. Swell- 
ings on different parts of the body and legs are not uncommon, and are 
only to be removed by care and good feeding. 

In common cold, or catarrh, the symptoms are similar to those in in- 
fluenza, but very much milder. The horse should be kept quiet and cool, 
the throat stimulated with mustard or liniment, to relieve the soreness and 
cough. He should be fed on bran mashes, with a few scalded oats in 
them, mixed with linseed, and have one or two fever drinks ; after which, 
if the attack be slight, a few days' rest and quiet will set him right. 

Congestion and inflammation of the lungs are highly dangerous, and 
no time should be lost in sending for the veterinary surgeon, and at once 
placing the horse under his care. This attack generally comes on with 
shivering, accompanied by hard, quick breathing and working of the flanks. 
The horse is dull, hangs his head, refuses his food, and his legs and ears 
are cold. When taken at once and in time the attack may soon be re- 
duced, but if neglected, it is a work of time, and frequently terminates 
fatally. 

Colic, or gripes, is another complaint to which horses are liable, the 
result generally of indigestion and gross feeding. Care must be taken to 
distinguish between it and inflammation of the bowels, as to an unprac- 
tised eye the symptoms are very similar. The horse is restless and 
uneasy, constantly looking round at his flanks, which are blown out and 
distended, and by repeatedly lying down and rolling, stamping, and 
kicking, showing the acute pain he is suffering. In colic there are inter- 
vals of ease and rest which do not occur in inflammation of the bowels. 
In this, as in other cases, it will be better and safer at once to send for the 
veterinary surgeon. 

Thrush is a very common complaint in horses ; it is a foul smelling 
discharge from the clefts of the frog both in the fore and hind feet, and is 
caused either from a want of cleanliness or from an inflamed state of the 
feet arising from a gross habit, or other causes. It occasionally produces 
lameness, and when very sore renders a horse unsafe on the road, where 
he is liable to tread upon loose rough stones. He should have a dose of 
physic, the feet be kept very clean, all the loose, ragged, diseased horn re- 
moved, and some common salt applied two or three times a week. Care 
must be taken to keep the feet dry and clean in the stable, and an altera- 
tive administered every three or four days. This treatment will soon 
effect a cure. 

Broken knees are the result of a fall upon some hard substance, as the 
road, &c, causing a lacerated wound. They should be washed as clean 
as possible with warm water, then well poulticed to remove all the dirt 
and grit that cannot be removed by washing, which will not only remove 
the soreness and reduce the inflammation, but very materially assist the 
healing. After which, if necessary, a strong stimulant may be used to 
reduce the enlargements and promote the growth of the hair. 

All horses, but particularly hunters, are exposed to accidents, as blows, 
thorns, and wounds. In most cases begin with a mild dose of physic, to 
cool the system. If the blow be severe use cooling lotions to subdue the 
inflammation, after which, if any enlargement remains, two or three 



Occasional A il in cuts of Hon set. 3^9 

dressings with biniodide of mercury will be found to reduce it. The in- 
flammation and soreness arising from thorns are only temporary. When 
possible they should be extracted ; but if not, poultices made of bran and 
linseed meal mixed should be constantly applied, hot. This will assist 
nature in promoting slight suppuration, and they will work out. 

In all cases of wounds, if large and severe, they must be first washed 
to remove all dirt, &c, then neatly sewn up, and the part well fomented 
with warm water. If slight, they should be bound up if necessary, and 
washed with arnica and water several times a day. 

Horses are occasionally pricked in shoeing, owing to the carelessness 
of the smith, or a nail may be picked up on the road. In either case the 
shoe must be removed, the horn cut away around the hole made by the nail 
to allow any matter that may have formed to escape, and the feet kept in 
a poultice till the inflammation has subsided, and all fear of further sup- 
puration is at an end. 

Swelled legs and cracked heels. — Many horses in the autumn are 
subject to swelling of the legs, but principally of the hinder ones. It is 
produced by the horse being out of health and condition, generally from 
debility, and is often accompanied by a cracking of the skin on the heels. 
Horses that have been summered at grass are particularly liable to swelled 
legs in the autumn, when put to work. Good feeding, tonics, and steady 
exercise, with an alterative ball twice a week, will soon set all right. 

When the heels are cracked the horse should be kept in the dry, as 
much as possible at exercise. They must be kept clean, with some gly- 
cerine ointment well rubbed in about an hour before going out, to keep 
the skin soft and pliable, and less likely to crack out again. But they are 
at all times tedious and difficult to cure. Some horses always have their 
heels more or less cracked all the winter. 

Lameness. — There are various and numerous causes of lameness in 
horses, brought on by hard work, disease, or the result of accident. Some 
of these rest and treatment will soon remove, and others are incu- 
rable. As this is not a veterinary work but intended to assist merely in 
the selection and management of horses, only a few of the most common 
will be briefly noticed. 

Splints are small bony enlargements on the fore legs of a horse ; they 
are generally situated on the inside, but occasionally occur on the outside. 
They do not always occasion lameness except in first forming, w T hen they 
are very sore. But few horses are quite free from them, and they are not 
generally of consequence unless interfering in any way with the action. 
Young horses are principally liable to them, as they are seldom met 
with in horses of seven or eight years old. There are several operations 
for removing them, as blistering, firing, setons, &c, but unless of any size 
and consequence rest and a strong blister will generally render them 
harmless. 

All horses, and particularly hunters, are subject to strains of various 
parts which for a time produce lameness, and are very frequently the 
effect of severe work before the horse is fully prepared for it. 

A curb is a swelling at the back part of the hock ; it generally occurs 
in young horses and is caused by a violent strain on that part. Some 
hocks are so formed as to be predisposed to throw curbs, and in them 
they are always likely to recur unless the part is properly fired. When 

B B 



370 Stable Servants. 



they occur in good shaped hocks the remedy is simple, and time and rest 
will effect a cure. 

Treatment. — A dose of physic, the parts to be kept cold and wet with 
cooling lotion. When the inflammation has subsided, three or four strong 
dressings with biniodide of mercury and a few weeks' rest. 

Strains of the back tendons and suspensory ligaments are violent strains 
of the tendons and ligaments between the knee and fetlock joint, and the 
hock and fetlock joint. Hunters and race horses are more liable to them 
than horses whose work is not so fast and severe. The horse should have a 
dose of physic, with cooling lotion constantly applied to the parts till the 
inflammation has subsided, after which strong blisters, and in bad cases 
the legs must be fired. Under no circumstances will the horse be fit to 
use for five or six months. 

Bone spavin is a bony deposit formed inside the joints forming the 
hock. It is the effect of strain and of hard work. If taken in time it may 
sometimes be cured or at any rate much alleviated. It is often incurable and 
the horse will remain lame for life, but much will depend upon the part of 
the hock affected. In the early stages much may be done by blistering and 
firing, but when confirmed it is incurable. In a mild form the horse will 
start lame even if he goes sound when warm. 

Corns are sometimes very troublesome. They come in the inside heel 
of the fore feet and are the result oi bad shoeing or neglect in allowing 
the shoe to remain on too long and thereby to press upon and bruise that 
part of the sensible sole. Horses with low weak heels are particularly 
liable to them. When slight and recent they are of little consequence if 
carefully treated, but if confirmed and of long standing are incurable, and 
it is only by the greatest care and having the shoes removed once a fort- 
night, the horse can be kept sound. The corns must be well pared away, 
the shoe hammered out so as not to press on the heels, and the parts 
dressed with ointment to remove the soreness, keep down the inflam- 
mation and promote the secretion of horn. There are several receipts 
for this, but the veterinary surgeon can always supply one that will answer 
the purpose. 

STABLE SERVANTS. 

The coachman must be a steady, sober, good-tempered, and respectable 
man, his office being in most cases a very responsible one ; many masters, 
either from want of energy, or through ignorance, leaving so much to his 
management. He not only has the entire control of the carriage and horses, 
buying the oats, hay, straw, &c, but very frequently selects and purchases 
the horses, so that, unless a conscientious man, he has it in his power 
to subject his master to serious loss and inconvenience. He must have 
had considerable experience in driving, to drive quietly and steadily 
without allowing the horses to jerk or snatch, which is most dis- 
agreeable and uncomfortable to those in the carriage, and thoroughly 
understand their management in the stable. No man, however willing, 
can attend properly to more than two horses and the carriage, and if the 
carriage be out on an average three hours a day he will find he has but 
little time to spare if properly turned out. The great inconvenience of 
having only one servant is, that on the carriage coming in wet and dirty, 
if it be not at once washed before the mud dries on, it will not only

take much longer to clean, but the paint and varnish suffer by the mud 
being allowed to dry on, while if this be done at once the horses are 
standing quite unattended to, at the risk of taking cold, getting cracked 
heels, &c. 

In case of accident or illness, however, disabling one horse, three or 
more are generally kept, in which case a helper is indispensable, and the 
wet carriage and horses can then receive proper and immediate attention. 

The coachman generally has rooms over the stable to protect the pro- 
perty, and to be on the spot in case of accident or illness to the horses, so 
that he lives rent free ; in addition to which his average wages will be 2/. 
per week including his livery, stable dress, coals, candles, &c. ; those of a 
helper will vary from 15s. to 1/. according to his age, and the locality. 
Where a coachman has but one horse and carriage to drive and attend to, 
a younger and less experienced man will answer the purpose, particularly 
in the country. In this case, as his time will not be fully occupied in the 
stable, he may be expected and required to make himself useful about the 
house, &c. His wages, too, will average 10s. or 12s. a week less than 
those of a superior coachman. 

The Groom. 

There are several descriptions and classes of grooms employed in 
private stables. With the stud-groom, for the breaking and training of 
thoroughbred horses, we have here nothing to do. The most important 
is the groom for the training and management of hunters. For this pur- 
pose he must be very steady, respectable, and intelligent, and have 
had considerable experience ; for as the hunter, to carry a man well and 
safely to hounds must be veiy fit, it follows that the groom must under- 
stand not only how to prepare him, but when he is fit. 

The preparation required for a hunter is such as to enable him to carry 
a certain weight through deep ground for some hours, often at a great 
pace, hence his wind must be clear, his flesh hard and firm, he must be 
full of power and muscle to perform the severe and long-continued exer- 
tion so often required of him. 

No groom can, without considerable experience, do this, as he must 
understand how to feed and treat the various habits and constitutions of 
the different horses that come under his charge, the quantity of corn, &c, 
and the amount of work best suited for each horse, and how to treat the 
various accidents, blows, strains, thorns, cuts, &c, to which all hunters 
are liable. 

A hunting-groom cannot properly attend to more than three hunters 
without help. In studs of five or six he should have two helpers under 
him, and in large studs one man to every three hunters, his own time will 
be fully taken up in a general superintendence of the helpers, attending to 
the horses that are ill, or have met with accidents, &c, and perhaps riding 
second horses for his master when hunting. 

A good hunting-groom is a very valuable servant, so much depending 
upon him as to the safety, comfort, and style in which a man is carried to 
hounds. He cannot of course make a good or fast horse out of a bad 
or slow one, but by proper care, attention, and exercise he can very much 
improve him, and a fair moderate horse fit to go will generally beat a 
really good one only half prepared.

3 7 2 Stable Management of the Horse. 

His average wages, including extras, will amount to from 30J. to 35 s. 
per week, but in his case, as in that of any first-rate trustworthy servant, 
a few additional pounds a year is money very well and economically laid 
out. 

Another class of groom is one that is rarely expected either to ride or 
drive. His duties are to feed, dress, and attend to the horses generally, 
and clean a chaise and harness, &c. He should be active, respectful, 
and obliging ; two horses with a chaise and harness will be as much as 
he can properly attend to ; and should he be expected occasionally to 
drive or ride he will need a helper ; nothing tends so much to spoil a ser- 
vant and make him idle and careless in his work as giving him more than 
he can fairly and properly do. When a groom is required to help in the 
stable, and ride behind his master and family, I know of no one so useful 
and fitted for the purpose as a good steady lad out of a racing stable, and 
who has grown too heavy for that work, as he is sure to be a good stable- 
man, and to ride well and smartly. 

After these come the nondescript class, part groom, part cowman and 
gardener, who are more useful than smart or ornamental. They cannot 
be called grooms, they simply just feed and "look after" the horse, or 
pony and carriage, and are for the most part young fellows who are either 
too lazy or too loutish to try to improve or take any pride or interest in 
their work. 

STABLE MANAGEMENT OP THE HORSE. 

In the morning the first thing the groom does on entering the stable, 
which must not be later than six o'clock, if the weather be warm and fine 
will be to open the door and admit some fresh air ; he will then give each 
horse a little water and a piece of hay ; having eaten which, he will put 
on the hood and watering-bridle, and take him out for exercise. While 
out, the helpers will separate the dry clean straw from the damp and soiled, 
removing the latter to the manure heap. Thoroughly sweep and cleanse 
the floor of each stall and box, allowing the straw to remain turned up 
until the return of the horses, when it may be partly littered down again. 
Each horse will then have a feed of corn, and having eaten it, be well 
dressed and his stall or box set fair. When one groom only is kept or 
where the horses do a fair amount of work during the day, early exercise 
is impossible and unnecessary. 

In dressing the horse the first thing the groom does is to turn him 
round in his stall, fold the rug back from his neck and shoulders, then 
well and carefully brush his head, neck, and shoulders with the body- 
brush, cleaning it with the currycomb as often as required. He is then 
turned back in the stall, the clothing removed, and his body, hind-quarters, 
and legs undergo the same careful and thorough brushing, care being 
taken to keep the brush clean with frequent use of the currycomb. He 
is next wiped all over with a damp whisp made of haybands, which entirely 
removes any remaining dust, and after being well wiped over with a linen 
rubber or wash-leather, his clothes are put on and secured by the roller. 
His eyes, nose, and anus are next sponged clean, his mane and tail care- 
fully combed or brushed, first with a dry and then with a clamp brush ; the 
feet are carefully picked out and washed, the legs well brushed, and if

dirty or stained, well washed, and either rubbed dry or dried in flannel 
bandages. The stall is then set fair and the horse ready for use. 

With grey or light-coloured horses, or that have white legs, the better 
plan will be to wash all stains off the quarters, &c., and to wash the legs 
with warm waiter and soap, rubbing the first dry and well bandaging the 
latter before proceeding to dress the horse, as by the time that operation 
is over the legs will be dry and the horse warm and comfortable. 

In the spring and autumn, when the horse is shedding his coat and 
the hair is broken and thin, the body-brush must be laid aside, the whisp 
and rubber being then quite sufficient for the necessary dressing. 

Before having the harness put on to go out the horse must again be 
wiped over, his mane and tail brushed, and his hoofs rubbed round with 
the oil-brush — some people object to the use of the oil-brush to the feet, 
and only have them done round with a wet brush. 

On returning to the stable after work, if he be clean and dry, his feet 
should be well picked out and washed, and he should again be well 
dressed and set fair. But if he returns hot and tired and wet and dirty, 
the best and quickest plan is to wash him all over with tepid water, 
scraping him immediately as dry as possible, clothing him up, and ban- 
daging his legs above his knees and hocks with flannel bandages. If the 
weather be warm, he may be washed in the open air, and a light suit of 
clothes put on, to be replaced by fresh as soon as he is dry ; but in winter, 
and if it be cold, he must be washed in the stable, and a suit of warm 
clothing put on until he is dry, when it must be changed. By this means 
the horse will be got fresh and comfortable in a much shorter time and 
with less fatigue to himself than if the dirt and sweat were removed in any 
other way and he was rubbed dry. 

At seven o'clock, the horses that have not been out or done but little 
work may again have their clothing removed and be wiped over, which 
must not be done when the horse is tired with work and has been once 
made fresh. They may then be fed, their heads let down, their feet 
stopped, and be shut up for the night. 

Food, 

Hay for horses should invariably be the best quality ; many different 
sorts and conditions being more or less detrimental to the digestion and 
wind. Good old upland meadow hay is the best, as being the hardest, 
sweetest, and most hearty. It should be of a pale brown colour, and smell 
sweet and clean. Hay of a green colour is generally grown on low, marshy 
ground, and is often dusty ; while the dark brown indicates that the stack 
has been very hot from having been put together in too green a state 
before it was properly made. Both are detrimental to the horse, and 
therefore to be avoided. 

The price of hay depends upon the quality, and the abundance or 
shortness of the crop. It varies from 4/. to 5/. ioj*., according to the 
season. 

Clover hay is but seldom used in private stables as being too coarse, 
except occasionally to cut up and mix with the chaff. When of fine quality, 
and well cut, it is remarkably sweet, and gives a flavour to the chaff that 
will often tempt a delicate horse to feed. 

Oats are the staple food for horses when in work, and are of various 



374 Food. 

kinds, English and foreign. The former are generally preferred, but some 
of the foreign oats are very good feed. Oats should be sweet, free from 
dirt and stones, and weigh nearly, if not quite, forty pounds per bushel. 
The lighter oats are generally deficient in kernel, while some of the heavier 
kinds, by thick coarse husks, make up the weight, which must be taken 
into consideration by the purchaser in making his selection. 

The price will vary from 10s. to 30J. per quarter ; good oats for general 
feeding may be had for 25^. per quarter. The value of the oat depends 
more upon the thinness of the husk and the amount of meal contained in 
the kernel, than upon the size and weight, which is often the result of thick, 
coarse husks. 

No oats should be used until they have been cut at least six months ; 
and if twelve or eighteen months they are so much the better. New oats, 
and oats that have been heated in the barn or stack, are not only very 
prejudicial to the horse, but it is impossible to get him into good condition 
on them, as being too soft and relaxing. 

Some horses bolt their corn nearly whole, which consequently does not 
do them so much good as it otherwise would. A double-handful of chaff 
in each feed will, to a certain extent remedy this, but crushing or bruising 
the oats in a mill is a far better remedy ; in fact, I quite believe that to 
bruise all the corn for horses would be found the most economical plan, 
as they would derive greater benefit from it by more easy and complete 
digestion, a smaller quantity would go as far, and the improved power and 
condition of the horse amply repay the labour and cost of bruising. 

By crushing or bruising I do not mean grinding to a powder, but merely 
crushing the husks and kernel. 

Beans are used only occasionally in feeding private horses when they 
are exposed to bad, rough weather for any length of time, or when tired 
and jaded and worn down by long courses of hard work. In small quan- 
tities they will then be found very useful to invigorate the frame, and warm 
and stimulate the impaired strength and digestion ; but they must not on 
any account be used if the horse be suffering from any inflammatory 
attacks either of the internal organs, or of the feet and legs, being too 
heating. In the autumn, when shedding the coat, many horses are subject 
to swelling of the legs ; in such cases beans are particularly good ; a 
quartern of good old beans a day to a quartern and a half may then be 
given with advantage, and if assisted by a few alterative balls will soon 
reduce all swelling, and strengthen and invigorate the horse in every way. 
Beans should be at all times a twelvemonth old. New beans are par- 
ticularly objectionable, and do more harm than good. 

White peas have the same effect as beans, and are used in the same 
way. To be good they must be old. Some prefer them to beans for 
hunters and horses that do fast work. Some, however, do better on peas 
and others on beans, which it is the duty of the groom to discover, and 
act accordingly. 

Bran is the husk of wheat separated from the flour after being ground ; 
it is very useful in the stable. It is made into mashes either hot or cold, 
and occasionally used for poultices for wounds, thorns, and blows. 
Mashes are very good given occasionally at night, instead of hay, as they 
have a laxative effect, and keep the horse's legs and body cool. After 
hunting, the horse should have a warm mash, with about a quartern and a 



Food. 375 

half of scalded oats in it instead of dry hay and oats, being easier of 
digestion, as from having often been many hours without food, he is apt 
to eat fast and ravenously, and thus fills the stomach with food it is not in 
a condition properly to digest. Sunday being an idle day in most private 
stables, Saturday is generally selected to give a mash, which may be hot 
or cold, according to the time of year and the condition of the horse. 
About half a pailful is the proper quantity. A horse should not on any 
account have a mash the night before hunting, or any other hard work is 
required of him. Some horses find a mash too relaxing under any cir- 
cumstances ; when a quartern of dry bran mixed with the oats at night 
will have the necessary effect. 

Chaff. — In all large establishments of working horses, as in the stables 
of omnibus proprietors and cab-masters, the object is to enable the horse 
to take his corn, &c. as quickly as possible and lie down to rest. For 
this purpose all the hay and clover is cut into chaff, and mixed with the 
oats, which not only enables the horse to eat it more readily and quickly, 
but also to grind it more thoroughly. Chaff is made of hay, clover, and 
wheat or barley or oat straw cut into short lengths, and then mixed. The 
general mixture for private stables is two-thirds good meadow-hay, and 
one-third clean wheat straw. Clover chaff is used principally for horses 
doing slower work than is generally the case with private horses. 

Carrots are occasionally given to horses as a slight alterative, they 
should be washed clean, and cut up into pieces. Horses are particularly 
fond of them, a few now and then are very good, and keep the body cool, 
but they must be given sparingly to hunters and horses required for hard, 
fast work. 

There are several kinds of green food for horses in the spring and 
summer, of which tares or vetches, Lucerne and clover are the principal. 
Tares or vetches when young are very good for fattening horses, but 
are then too relaxing for work ; as they get older and full of seed they are 
harder, and with some corn, horses will do a considerable amount of work 
on them, but in a general way they are used only sparingly as a natural 
alterative, and given in a small quantity once or twice a day. Lucerne is 
a green meat, as tares, but harder and drier in its nature ; a piece of 
Lucerne once sown will last for years, yielding at least five cuts every 
year ; it wants to be kept very clean, and occasionally manured. Horses 
are not as fond of it as of tares and clover. 

Clover like tares is very fattening, and too relaxing in a young and 
green state for horses to work upon. There are several other kinds of 
green food, but they are in all respects inferior to those I have mentioned. 

Straw. — For the bedding of horses wlieac straw is generally used. 
The greater part of wheat is now thrashed out by machine, and but little 
by hand, consequently the straw is not so good, and does not last so long 
as formerly, the machine breaking and bruising the straw so much more 
than the flail. 

A careless groom will use at least one truss of straw per week more to 
each horse, than a good careful one will use. The latter will be careful in 
the morning on turning up the bed to separate the soiled, dirty straw from 
that which may be used again ; removing the former from the stable, he will 
then, after thoroughly sweeping out the stall or box, put what may be a 
little damaged at the bottom, and the clean at the top. Such a groom will 



376" Feeding. 



use about two trusses to two and a half per week while another would 
use at least one truss a week more. 

The best way to economise litter is to sweep the stall or box out as 
dry and as clean as possible in the morning, and take up the droppings 
regularly at once, before they are trodden into the straw. 

Straw when good is bright and clean looking. The price will vary 
from 305-. to 45^. per load according to the season. In wet seasons it is 
difficult to get good straw, as it is generally then dark and mildewed- 
looking from the rain. At any time, good oat or barley straw is better 
for cutting into chaff than wheat straw, but it is not easy to obtain ; most 
farmers keeping it for fodder for home use. 

Eco7i07ny in the stable depends entirely upon the groom. If he does 
his duty well and conscientiously, he will keep down the expenses as far 
as is practicable with justice to the horse. Nothing whatever is gained 
by buying cheap or inferior fodder, on the contrary the horse suffers 
in every way, in condition, appearance, and value. 

Feeding. 

The ordinary food for horses is corn and hay. They should have the 
corn four times a day — at about seven, eleven, three and seven ; and the 
hay twice — at night and in the morning. These times may be slightly 
varied to suit the convenience. The quantity of each must depend upon 
the size and description of horse, and the amount of work required of 
him. A full-sized carriage horse will require at least five quarterns of corn, 
and about twelve or fourteen pounds of hay, daily. These horses being 
kept for show and style rather than for work, are required to be full of 
flesh to give them a grander and more imposing appearance. 

The hunter having hard, fast, and long-continuous work to perform, 
greater care is required in feeding him. Some hunters are delicate feeders, 
and cannot under any circumstances be induced to eat more than three 
quarterns of corn and beans in the twenty-four hours ; consequently they 
never look well, are never quite fit, and cannot come again more than 
once in ten days or a fortnight. Such horses must be got fit as best they 
may by changing the diet as often as possible, and by giving only a little 
at a time, but frequently. By changing the diet I mean, by sometimes 
giving old beans with the corn, at other times old white peas, and adding 
at one time good hay chaff, at another clover chaff, and occasionally a 
few pieces of chopped carrot mixed with the corn — in fact, trying almost 
everything that will tempt a delicate horse to feed. 

From five to six quarterns of corn, with a few good old beans or white 
peas, and ten or twelve pounds of good old meadow hay, is the average 
daily food of a hunter going three days a fortnight. It is a great mistake 
to get a hunter too fine, as the work being hard and long-continued, he 
must be full of muscle and strong, but at the same time in good wind. 
It is difficult to lay down any definite rules for feeding hunters, as some 
require much more food than others to keep them in the same condition. 
As soon as convenient after a day's hunting the horse should have some 
gruel — it is better than corn, as being easy of digestion and more invigo- 
rating for a tired horse. A hack will require from three to four quarterns 
of corn a day, and about the same quantity of hay as the hunter. His 
work is much lighter and he requires a more round and fleshy appearance. 



Wafer — Summering the Hunter. 377 

Beans are only occasionally necessary for hacks, and then only when 
much exposed to bad and wet weather. Harness horses must be fed in 
much the same way as hacks, but much depends upon their size and the 
work they are required to perform. Ponies require about two quarterns 
of corn daily, and seven or eight pounds of hay, some even less than that, 
as they are invariably hardy, and unless hard worked will keep fat on 
very little. Horses of all sizes and all descriptions should have chaff 
mixed with every feed of corn, as it enables them to masticate the oats 
more thoroughly, and so far assists digestion. 

Water. 

Where practicable it will be better for the horse to have water 
constantly by him in a small tank for the purpose, that he may drink when 
he feels disposed ; when such is the case he drinks less than when it is 
offered to him at stated times. 

In stables unfitted with tanks the water must be taken to the horse 
not less than four times a day, and he then may be allowed to take as 
much as he pleases in moderation. 

Pond water is the best for horses when it can be procured, and even 
when dirty they take it in preference to any other. Hard pump water is 
often injurious at first till they become used to it, but that is at all times 
preferable to stale stagnant rain water. Hard water will to some extent 
produce indigestion and consequently a rough staring coat. 

Care must be taken to water the horse some little time before starting 
him on a journey, and also on his return, that he is not allowed to drink 
too much at first, and if the horse be heated and the water be cold, it 
should be just chilled before allowing him to drink, or serious results may 
follow. 

Summering the Hunter, 

There still exists much difference of opinion on this point, but when 
we consider that the great object to be attained is rest, it must be evident 
to all who have seen horses at grass in the summer, that the old plan of 
turning the hunter to grass is about the very least likely way to obtain it. 
The ground is then very hard, the sun hot and oppressive, and even in 
the shade under the trees, the horse is constantly tormented by flies. He 
is never still, walking backwards and forwards, kicking and stamping to 
knock them off, till, unable any longer to bear them, he takes a mad 
gallop round the field. This state of things cannot be rest, but more 
destructive to the legs and feet than any ordinary amount of work. In 
addition to which, the horse gets big and lusty on soft green food, all 
which has to be taken off at the expense of his legs and feet, before he is 
fit to go, and is another very unsuitable preparation for the work required 
of him in the winter. The modern plan, the advantages of which are 
every year becoming more and more apparent, is, at the end of the hunt- 
ing season to cool the hunter, by giving him a dose of physic and then 
gradually taking off his clothing. At the end of a month he may be 
turned into a large cool box or shed, have from two to three quarterns of 
corn a day, according to his constitution, with green meat in sufficient 
quantities to act as a natural alterative and tonic to his system and get 
him fresh, but not fat and out of shape, as is too often the case. His hind 



378 Exercise and Work. 



shoes may be taken off, and light shoes or tips put on the fore feet, and 
removed about once a month. These will prevent his feet getting broken 
away and preserve them in shape. If he require blistering, or has any 
lumps or bumps on his legs, from blows or thorns, to be sweated down, 
it should at once be done. For this the biniodide of mercury will be 
found the best. At the beginning of August at the latest, the hunter 
may be taken up, his legs and feet will be found to be clean and cool, he 
should have a dose of physic, and begin steady exercise ; after which, if 
the groom do his duty, he will be free from the different complaints that 
usually attack a horse summered in the field, and when the hunting 
season arrives he will carry his master safely and pleasantly through runs 
that will soon stop the other for want of real condition. 

EXERCISE AND WORK. 

Unless the weather is wet and bad, every horse, whether in a stall or 
box, is better for going out every day. 

The work of a carriage horse does not on an average exceed seven or 
eight miles. They are very often out for three or four hours in the day, 
but by far the greater part of the time they are standing about, while the 
occupants of the carriage are either shopping or making calls, &c. From 
their size and weight they are generally unfit for long journeys and hard 
work. 

The work of a hunter is to carry a man to hounds ; and in order to 
render him fit to do so safely and well, he will require a great deal of 
exercise. 

Before the commencement of the hunting season he will require three 
hours' steady walking and trotting exercise, with occasional sweats and 
strong gallops ; but afterwards, supposing he is ridden to hounds three 
days a fortnight, he will require but little fast exercise— from two to three 
hours a day good steady walking will keep most horses quite fit. 

To go with stag hounds, a horse must be drawn rather finer than for 
fox hounds, his work being faster, but not so long continued. The meet is 
later ; the deer is uncarted, and the run begins at once, seldom lasting 
more than from an hour and a half to two hours. 

With fox hounds, on the contrary, the meet is earlier, and a fox is often 
not found till after a long draw. The run, from various causes — checks, 
bad scent, &c, is very seldom very fast or so long as with stag hounds, 
consequently the work of the horse is not so severe and distressing. 

On leaving hounds, the hunter should have some gruel and a handful 
of hay at the first convenient place ; he may then, if not fatigued, be 
ridden home at the rate of six or seven miles an hour. On reaching th# 
stable, he will be washed and scraped as dry as possible, a complete sui 
of clothing put on, his legs bandaged with flannel bandages, some chilled 
water and moist food given him, and left till dry. He must then be 
wiped over, dry clothing put on, his legs well hand-rubbed, dry bandages 
put on, again fed and watered, and set fair for the night. 

The fair average day's work for a hack or harness horse is nine or ten 
miles, in which case exercise is quite unnecessary. More harm and injury 
are done to horses by the grooms when at exercise than in any other way, 
and unless the man can be fully depended upon, the less they are exercised 



Clipping or Singeing. 379 

the better. Where the horse is only occasionally worked, exercise is of 
course absolutely necessary, not only to preserve him in health, but to 
keep him steady, and from getting above himself. 

Clipping or Singeing 

Is one of the greatest improvements ever introduced into stable 
management. It is a blessing not only to the horse, but to eveiy one who 
uses and attends to him. A horse clipped or singed will not only do 
double the amount of work on the same amount of food that a horse with 
his natural winter coat will do, but in the one case he will be fresh, 
cheerful, and full of vigour ; while in the other, he will be dull, out of 
condition, and seldom or never dry and clean. I have seen horses 
(hunters particularly) that no care or food could get into condition till 
clipped or singed, immediately change for the better, and get big in their 
ivork. 

The best time to clip or singe a horse must depend principally upon 
the state of his coat. Some shed their coat so much earlier than others, 
while in some horses it is much thicker and coarser. About the end of 
September is the best time for singeing, and three weeks or a month later 
for clipping. 

Clipping requires much practice and very neatly doing to look well ; it 
is far more difficult than singeing, and consequently is not so frequently 
used. The effect of both is the same — to shortern the long rough winter 
coat to the length of the short summer one, thereby preventing that 
extreme sweating which is always consequent on a long winter coat. It 
\s performed with scissors and a comb. The former are generally curved, 
and of various sizes, to suit the different parts of the body of the horse 
for which they are used. 

Singeing is performed with a lamp made for the purpose, burning 
naphtha or some spirit of the same description, and which is passed lightly 
over the whole body till the hair is reduced to the required length. It 
may be commenced as soon as the winter coat is partly grown, and must 
be repeated about every ten days or a fortnight till the coat is set and 
done growing, by which means the coat will not only be kept short but 
the hair will better retain the natural colour. After Christmas, about once 
in three weeks will generally be found sufficient to keep down the long, 
rough hairs. 

In some horses the coat is of so thick, coarse, and woolly a nature, or 
has been left so long, it is impossible to singe it without burning it into 
holes, and making the horse look worse than before. In this case he must 
first be clipped close, and then the singeing-lamp run lightly over him ; it 
can then be kept down by singeing, as in other horses, but his colour will 
be changed, as the part exposed, or rather left, will be the under part of 
the hair next the body, which is always of a different shade to the top 
hair, which, in horses that are begun early and singed frequently, from 
being never burnt quite down, retains its colour. After clipping and 
singeing, the horse should have a gentle sweat, be well washed, rubbed 
dry, and well clothed, after which he is fit and ready for his usual work. 

Some few very well-bred horses have in winter so fine a coat that beyond 
removing the few long, ragged hairs about their flanks and quarters, no 
singeing is necessary. 



3S0 Shoeing. — Tricks and Vices io which Horses arc liable. 



Shoeing. 

Several different plans have at various times been suggested for 
shoeing the horse, but none have as yet superseded that in general use, all 
the others having one or more great disadvantages. The horse must be 
shod according to his size and the amount of work he has to perform. 
The shoes ought to last at least three weeks or a month, as it is detri- 
mental to the feet to have them removed oftener than once in three weeks ; 
while on the other hand, they should never be on more than a month 
without removing. Care must be taken that, except where the horse has 
very strong feet, the horn is never cut away when shod ; all that is 
necessary is to have the rough, ragged parts removed and the foot just 
rasped round the toe. If this were well attended to, there would not be 
so many lame horses ; as, when left to themselves, farriers invariably cut 
away more horn at each shoeing than will grow before the horse has to 
be shod again, consequently they have but little left to hold the nails and 
bear the weight of the horse. 

TRICKS AND VICES TO WHICH HORSES ARE LIABLE, 

some of which arise from fear and nervousness, and others from vice 
or from improper breaking. All vicious and nervous horses should be 
avoided by all who do not thoroughly understand them. Of these rearing 
is the most dangerous, as a fall over backwards often leads to fatal 
results to the rider. A horse may rear occasionally from fear, but it more 
generally proceeds from vice. Several plans and bits have been suggested 
to cure rearers, but all are attended with more or less danger to both horse 
and man. They are best left to rough-riders, and those who thoroughly 
understand the management of vicious horses, as nothing but time and 
work will cure them. 

Kicking 

is another dangerous vicious habit. Like rearing, it may be cured by 
those who thoroughly understand horses ; but even when perfectly quiet 
and manageable in their hands, such horses are never to be trusted with 
less experienced persons. 

Running Away 
is another very dangerous fault. It may arise from vice or from the 
horse having been at some time very seriously alarmed. In the former 
case, a very sharp bit and great care may prevent it ; but in the latter, 
when the horse again becomes alarmed, nothing will stop him, as he is 
for the time in a state of madness. 

Bucking or Plunging 

is another dangerous habit. Sometimes it arises from vice and some- 
times only from freshness, the horse being above himself from want of 
work ; in the latter case it is soon cured by putting him to daily steady 
work. 

Jibbing 
either in saddle or harness is a very dangerous vice, and is always 
the result of bad temper. In saddle the horse rears, kicks, and rubs 
the rider against anything in his way. He will go anywhere and rush 



Shying. — Harness for Saddle Horses. 381 

anywhere but in the direction in which he is wanted to go. A good thrash- 
ing will sometimes cure him, but it is not always easy to do it, as the horse 
invariably jibs in the most awkward and dangerous places in which to fight 
him. In harness the jibber will not start, he runs back, and if whipped 
or punished will plunge and throw himself down. Such animals are quite 
unfitted for private use. 

Shying. 

This bad habit may arise from timidity, defective eyesight, or bad 
temper. If from timidity it can only be overcome by gentle usage and 
allowing the horse to pass the object without taking any notice of his fear 
beyond patting and encouraging him ; to chastise him is worse than use- 
less and senseless. If it arise from defective vision, it will be incurable, 
as it will be impossible for the animal to see objects otherwise than 
through a distorted medium. If it arise from vice, which is frequently the 
case, the horse must be made firmly but temperately to pass the object at 
which he shies ; having passed it, continue the ride, do not return and 
pass it again and again, as that only irritates him, and when he finds he 
is mastered, he will daily improve. 

Most of the above defects and vicious habits, if not absolutely caused 
by bad and injudicious treatment and breaking, are often increased by it ; 
nor is this to be wondered at, when we consider the class of men who are 
generally employed to break young horses, their roughness, ignorance, 
and often drunkenness. They break them all in the same way without 
any reference to their different and peculiar tempers and dispositions, 
whereas a little care and thought would check and frequently prevent 
faults and defects, which, in some cases, become incurable and highly 
dangerous, and render the horse comparatively unsaleable. 

There are many other minor faults, too numerous to mention here, 
most of which are capable of cure, or, at any rate, of great amelioration 
in the hands of a good horseman or coachman, but the less experienced 
will do well to purchase only such horses as are steady and suitable for 
their work. 

HARNESS FOR SADDLE HORSES. 

These consist of saddles, bridles, breast-plates and martingales. 

Saddles may be had of almost any size or weight, to suit the rider, one 
of twelve or fourteen pounds is about the average weight. They may be made 
with either plain or padded flaps, according to the seat and fancy of the 
rider. Some prefer the former, and others the latter. For the generality 
of riders there cannot be a doubt that the padded flaps are by far the 
better, as they keep the knee more steadily in the proper place, prevent 
the leg flying backwards and forwards if the horse jumps or plunges ; 
while in hunting they are of a very material assistance in taking a drop 
jump, and also in steadying and recovering a horse when blundering or 
falling at a fence. The plain flaps have perhaps a smarter appearance, 
and a clever horseman may be able to ride as well on them as on the 
padded flaps, but that is almost all that can be said for them. 

The saddle should be of sufficient length and breadth that the weight 
of the rider may be pretty equally distributed over it, or the back of the 
horse will suffer, and saddle galls be the result. Every hunting and riding

man knows, from experience, how difficult and tedious it is to get a back 

right after being once galled. 

The stirrups should not be small, for, in the event of a fall, the foot is 

more likely to hang in them. 

All well-made saddles have 

spring bars, which should be oc- 
casionally oiled, that they may 

work easily, and release the 

stirrup-leather should such an 

accident occur. The stirrup- 
leather should be of the best, 

close and strong, not too heavy, 

or it will look clumsy. 

Every saddle requires two 

girths — which may either be of 

the ordinary kind of the same 

width, with a buckle at each 
end, or one broad with two 
buckles at each end, which is 
put on first, and a second, about 
half the width only, over it, with 
one buckle at each end. The 
latter, called 
the Fitzwilliam 
girth, is the 
better and 
stronger for 
hunting. 

After use, the 
lining of the 
saddle must be 
thoroughly 
dried in the sun, 
or before the 
fire, and then 
well brushed, 
which will keep 
it soft and clean. 

This is particularly necessary with side-saddles. It is for want of this 
care and attention that so many horses have sore backs. When dirty, the 
saddle must be sponged clean, but not made more wet than is absolutely 
necessary ; after which, a little soft soap rubbed on will preserve the leather 
soft and pliable, and prevent it cracking. 

In choosing a saddle, go to a first-rate maker ; he may be a little more 
expensive, but you will get a good article, that will wear three times as 
long as an inferior one, will fit the generality of horses, will never get out 
of form, and will look well to the last. The price, complete, will be about 
6 guineas ; that of a side-saddle, about 10 guineas. 

The Breast-plate or Hunting-plate 

is used to keep the saddle in its place when hunting. It is also of 
great service on horses with short back-ribs, to prevent the saddle workincr

back, which it is very likely to do. Both on the road and in the field no 
lady should ride without one, as it will keep the side-saddle securely in 
its place, and prevent it turning round should the girths get loosened, or 
one break. 

The Martingale 

is used to steady the horse's head, and keep it in its proper place. 

It is generally used on loose weak-necked horses, and though of service 
in the hands of the experienced, it is often dangerous when used by others, 
as being apt to catch on the bit or buckles of the bridle, and so cause 
serious accidents. 

The Bridle. 

There is a great variety of bits suitable for different descriptions and 
tempers of horses, but it is impossible to describe them all in so limited a 
space. They all belong to one of two classes— the snaffle or the curb, and 
are of different degrees of severity and power. 

The snaffle is a piece of steel with a joint in the middle ; it may be 
smooth and plain, twisted, or double-jointed. The smooth snaffle is the 
mildest form of bit there is, and, except just for exercise, few horses ride 
pleasantly in one. The twisted bit is sharper, and if drawn quickly back- 
wards and forwards through the mouth is very punishing. The double- 
jointed is the most severe ; it is formed of two plain snaffles one above 
the other ; but the joints in each not being opposite each other, cause a 
sharper and more narrow pressure on the tongue and lower jaw. Very 
few horses ride well and pleasantly in a snaffle of any kind, as they all 
cause a horse to raise his head and open his mouth, to take the pressure 
off his tongue. In addition to these there are the chain-snaffle, which 
is a very light bit, and the gag, used for horses that get their heads 
down. 

The curb-bit is a lever that, by means of a curb-chain, acts upon the 
lower jaw, and may be made very easy or very severe according to the 
length of the cheek or leverage, and the height of the port or arch in the 
centre of the mouth-piece. It is very seldom used singly, but in conjunc- 
tion with some kind of snaffle, when it forms a double-rein bridle, and is 
by far the most useful bit. All horses go better in it, when properly 
handled, than in any other, as by lengthening or shortening the curb- 
chain, and taking up or dropping the bit in the mouth, it can be made 
either less or more severe, to suit most horses. 

The Pelham is a curb and snaffle in one ; it is a curb-bit with a joint 
in the middle, instead of a port. It forms a double-rein bridle, and is 
very light and easy. 

The Hanoverian is of the same description, but with a port and a 
joint on each side of it. The mouth-piece is covered with small rollers. 
This forms a double-rein bridle of great power and severity, requiring 
great care and judgment. 

Like saddles, the bridles should be of first-rate material and work- 
manship ; the bits sewn on to the head-pieces and reins, as being much 
neater and lighter than the buckles. The leather must be kept clean and 
pliable with soft soap, and the bits clean and bright with silver-sand and 
oil. Price of a snaffle bridle about 20s., and of a double-rein bridle 28 s. 
to 305*., according to the sort of bit required.

MODERN CARRIAGES 

are of various sorts and sizes, from the small pony-chaise to the heavy 
family coach or landau. They should be made of the very best materials 
and purchased of first-rate builders, to ensure wearing well. Nothing 
looks much worse than any carriage of a cheap, common description. 
They are badly made, badly hung, and badly painted, and consequently 
soon wear out. If wanted to be sold, no one cares to buy them except for 
a very trifling sum ; while any carriage by a first-rate maker will always 
look and wear well as long as it will hold together, and will fetch a good 
price if offered for sale.

Except in the country and by elderly people, the heavy coach and 
landau are now seldom used, being superseded by carriages of a lighter 
and more elegant description. 

Double Broughams 

are generally drawn by a pair of horses ; they have two seats and hold 
four inside, but are more comfortable with three. They vary in size, 
some being larger and heavier than others ; average price 200/., according 
to style, finish, &c. 

Single Broughams 
have but one seat and hold two inside ; they may be drawn by either one 
horse or two smaller ones. When really well appointed they are very 
stylish carriages. Average price 160/. 

The Waggonette 
is an open carriage opening behind with a door ; it will hold either four 
or six. II generally full it will require a pair of horses to draw it comfort

ably. It is a useful family carnage, and is often made with a hood to 
take on and off to suit all weathers. Price from 80/. to 100/., according 
to size, &c. 

The Canoe Waggonette 

is a variation of that in general use. The entrance is on each side be- 
hind the box, it will hold six, who sit in a semicircle round the back from 
one door to the other. It is a comfortable carriage, but does not seem to 
take with the public. 

The Victoria 

is the most modern and stylish of all light open carriages. They are 
intended to carry two only, but are occasionally made on a larger scale,

with two seats, to carry four. In the latter case they require a pair of 
horses. Price from 120/. to 150/, 

The Park- driving Phaeton 

or T cart is a light and stylish carriage for one or two horses. It is 
very fashionable, and has quite superseded the old buggy and gig in 
general use, as being safer in case the horse slips and falls. Price from 
100/. to 120/. 

The Skeleton Phaeton 

is the lightest four-wheel carriage there is ; it is not often used except 
where great lightness is required. To look well it must be very neatly 
and stylishly built. Price about 60/. 

The Gig, 

or Buggy, as it is generally called, is a two-wheeled carriage for one

horse. Of late years they have gone very much out of fashion, particularly 
in town, but are still used in the country. Price about 60/. 

The Dog Cart 

is a two-wheeled carriage, to carry either two or four ; the seats are 
placed back to back. They are very useful in the country to take a party 
to cover, or on shooting and fishing excursions, as they are strong, have a 
large boot for dogs, guns, and fishing tackle, and follow well. They 
require to be very nicely hung and properly balanced or they are very 
uncomfortable, particularly in the back seat. Price 60/. to 80/. 

There are many other sorts and descriptions of carriages for horses 
and ponies, from the cheap basket carriage at 20/. up to almost any price. 

All carriages should be washed as soon as they come in from use and 
while the dirt is wet, as, if allowed to dry on, the paint and varnish soon 
become scratched and worn, as few coachmen will take the trouble 
thoroughly to wet the mud again before trying to remove it, which seri- 
ously injures the carriage, by taking all the gloss off the paint, &c.

polished until just before the carriage is required for use, as it will get 
dull or tarnished by standing in the coachhouse. The inside and cushions 
should also be brushed, and if the coachhouse be damp the latter must be 
taken into the harness-room and be kept dry. 

Cleaning Harness, &c. 

Both single and double harness should be of the best leather and 
workmanship. 

The harness for carriage horses of all sorts is too well known to need 
repetition here ; the only difference is that some prefer it very neat, and 
only use what is absolutely necessary, while others like it covered with 
plate or brass, and use as much as they can possibly get on the horse. 
The price will vary according to the amount of plate or brass-work on it. 
A set of single harness will cost from 12/. to 16/., or even more ; and a set 
of double harness from 25/. to 3^/. Care must always be taken that the 
collars are deep enough, otherwise the horse's shoulders will suffer. The 
proper way to fit a collar is to hold the horse's head up as high as he 
usually carries it when going, and then leave room to put the hand in 
comfortably. 

Many horses, particularly those defective in the wind, go better in a 
pipe collar. On coming in from use, the bits, ferrets, &c, should first be 
removed, then the harness, if dirty, should be carefully washed clean, but 
not made more wet than is absolutely necessary, then dried in the harness- 
room, but not put near the fire ; when dry it should be thoroughly done 
over with some harness paste or polish, and well brushed bright. The 
bits and ferrets, &c, are also cleaned and polished and everything is ready 
for use.

four wheels, 2/. 2s. ; on every carriage with two wheels, i$s. ; on every

THE DAIRY. 



Observations on the Dairy. — A dairy of cows, when well selected and 
managed, is no doubt a source of profitable employment where there is 
plenty of provision and accommodation for such stock : particular atten- 
tion, however, to everything relating to their food, shelter, treatment, and 
the management of their produce in the dairy, is necessary to ensure 
success. The master's eye wants to be often looking on, to see that all 
persons employed are kindly disposed, and conduct their work in a re- 
gular, cleanly, and orderly manner. Unkind treatment, improper or 
irregular feeding, or unskilful milking of cows, would either of them be 
detrimental to the success of the undertaking. 

Situation, and how built. — A building for a dairy should be situated 
in a shady place, out of the reach of impure air, and have a northern or 
eastern aspect. If built with bricks and covered with tiles, the walls 
should be not less than nine inches thick, if fourteen inches it would be 
better ; the roof should be ceiled, and the windows latticed, glazed, and 
provided with sliding inside shutters for keeping out excessive heat or 
cold, otherwise the proper temperature of the dairy cannot be regulated 
in summer or winter. 

Supposing a dairy to be built for a dozen cows, it would be necessary 
to divide it into three rooms, two below and one above — viz., the milk- 
room or dairy, the wash-house, and the cheese chamber. The dairy for 
milk alone ; the other lower room for butter and cheesemaking, and for 
washing and scalding the dairy utensils ; the upper chamber for cheeses. 

Ventilation. — It would be as well to have two or three air-bricks in- 
serted in the northern wall of the milk-room some distance apart, about a 
foot from the ground, and the same number in the opposite side wall, 
about a foot from the ceiling. If the north side air-bricks were left open 
during the summer months, it would be found that a current of cool air 
would come in and lessen the temperature, as the warm air would ascend 
and pass through the upper air-bricks. In the winter all the air-bricks 
should be closed, as quite sufficient ventilation could be obtained from 
the windows. 

Size. — The size of the milk-room should not be less than fifteen feet 
square, and the other room quite as large, with chimney and copper 
placed at a distance from the dairy or milk-room ; and it would be best 
if entered by a passage, and if the door were placed so that it did not 
open into the milk-room, as the heat and steam should be entirely ex- 
cluded. The floor of both rooms should be paved with bricks or flags, 
with a slight incline towards the drain, which might either run down the 
centre, or be placed at one side. The water must either be laid on or 
the wash-house provided with a pump. 

Shelving. — Wide shelves about thirty inches from the floor would be 
required to hold full double the number of milk-pans that there are cows 



39° Different kinds of Cows. 



besides shelves for cream-pots, pans, and other articles belonging to the 
dairy. 

Utensils. — The utensils required where butter and cheese are made 
are a churn, a butter-stand, milk pans, pails, bowls, strainers, coolers, 
dishes, cheese-tubs, vats, girth butter-boards, markers, brushes, cloths, 
presses, thermometer and weighing machine, and sundry pots and pans, 
the cost of which would be about 20/. 

Cleanliness. — A scrupulous attention to cleanliness is absolutely neces- 
sary. All the pots and pans, and indeed everything that comes into 
contact with milk, butter, cream, or cheese, must first be well washed, 
scrubbed, and rinsed with cold water, and scalded before using a second 
time ; for unless the strictest cleanliness be practised, the produce of the 
dairy cannot be good. 

Different kinds of Cows. 

The large kinds of cows are generally chosen where there are rich 
fertile pastures ; and no doubt the dominant breed throughout the country, 
both for indoor and outdoor feeding, is the Shorthorn. This breed is 
divided into several varieties — the Holderness, Northumberland, Durham, 
Yorkshire, &c. The Yorkshire is thought to be the best for the dairy. 
These fine animals appear to have descended from the Teeswater breed. 
There are a great many varieties of the large cows in this country that 
have been bred by Shorthorn bulls. An excellent cross is common in the 
Eastern Counties between the best Suffolk cows and Shorthorn animals 
of the best blood. They are good milkers, harmless, and very quiet, and 
consequently much approved of for pasture feeding. Cows of this breed 
will produce from ten to twelve pounds of butter per week each, when 
well managed ; and for butter dairying the quantity and quality of cream 
produced is of greater importance than the quantity of milk. 

Cheshire Cows. — The Cheshire dairy farms are mostly stocked with a 
mixed breed of cows, between the Cheshire, Lancashire, and other crosses. 

Lci7icashire. — The Lancashire are distinguished by their long horns, 
deep fore-quarters, and long hair. They, as well as other long-horned 
cows, are said to give richer milk than polled cows, but not so much of 
it. Besides the milking properties of a breed of cows, their hardy quali- 
ties must be thought of, where they are exposed to bleak situations ; and 
no doubt the long-horned Lancashire and other coarse -skinned animals 
are the most hardy. 

Devons. — The middle-horned breed of cows may include the Devons, 
the Herefords, and the Sussex. The two latter are the largest, but neither 
of them excel the best Shorthorn in their produce of milk. The Devons 
are of a light-red colour, with yellowish coloured horns, well made, and 
their milk is rich — or we should not have such rich Devonshire cream. 
Many gentlemen prefer this breed for a herd in their parks. 

He?yfo)'d. — The Hereford, next in size to the Shorthorn breed, is a 
fine animal and a pretty good one for dairy stock, but better perhaps for 
fattening purposes. The Sussex do not differ much from the Hereford ; 
they are both of a darker colour than the Devons, with horns of a mo- 
derate length, turning up at the points, having wide hips and smallish 
bones. They are middling cows for the dairy. 



Different kinds oj Cows. 391 



Galloway. — The polled Galloways are very nice animals for grazing 
purposes ; they are mostly black, well proportioned in form, and yield an 
average quantity of milk, when carefully used, for dairy purposes. 

Highland. — The Highland are not thought to be better milk producers 
than the Galloways, but more hardy. 

Ayrshire. — The Ayrshire cow is a favourite in some places, but not 
preferred by cow-keepers in general. It is, however, a good animal for 
the dairy, and almost equal to the Alderney in the richness of its milk. It 
has fine wrinkled horns, is larger than the Alderney and somewhat like it 
in appearance. Its colour is usually red and white. 

Shetland. — The Shetland cattle are very small, and inferior in shape 
to those of the Western Highlands. They are hardy, small consumers 
of food, and yield about two quarts of milk a day. 

Welsh. — The Pembrokeshire cow is small and hardy. It is fine 
boned, with clean light head and neck, small yellow horn, good chine, 
long round barrel, thin thigh and short fine legs, always in good con- 
dition if tolerably kept, and has a rich wave in her hair which ever 
denotes thriftiness of kind. Its produce is from five to seven pounds of 
butter a week during the dairy season. 

Irish. — The Kerry cattle, in size and shape, resemble some of those 
from the Western Islands, of a high bred deer-like shape, not so broad 
or so low in the leg as the native Highland Stots. These cattle are very 
hardy, being reared in a country of rocks and hills. Their properties are 
said to be that of giving the largest quantity of milk, which is also of the 
richest quality for the amount of sustenance they require. 

Alderney. — The little Alderney cow is a slender made animal, not 
very well shaped, though admired for its deer-like mild face and fine 
bone, it is mostly of a red and white colour with a mottled face. The Al- 
derney gives the richest milk of any kind, and some of them have been 
known to produce ten and eleven pounds of butter a week of the finest 
quality. They are rather tender and require to be well housed in the winter. 

Stiffolk. — The Suffolk cow is believed to be the best of the polled 
breeds for the dairy where the pastures are not very rich. They are 
quiet, hardy, and suitable for upland fields. It is thought that the Dun 
coloured originally descended from the Galloway ; they do not, however, 
generally appear to be so uniformly well-shaped as the Galloway, al- 
though they have been vastly improved of late years by careful breeders. 
Various crosses between them and the Ayrshire, and other varieties, have 
increased the produce of the dairy in many places ; but it is believed 
that for large dairies, no cross is superior to that of the Suffolk cow and 
the Shorthorn bull. 

Whichever breed is made choice of to improve the stock, both male 
and female should be of the best animals. By a first-class bull a hardy 
well-formed and abundant milk-producing cow, is almost sure to produce 
valuable calves to bring up for the future supply of the dairy. 

Price. — The price given of late years for the live-stock of first-class 
breeders, has been enormous, hundreds and even thousands of pounds 
have been given for a single animal. It would not, however, answer the 
purpose of those who only keep a dairy for profit to purchase very high 
priced stock. Good cows may be obtained of the large breeds, which a 



39 2 Different kinds of Cows. 

few years ago cost 20/., for about 28/. now, and there is the same 
difference, or nearly 30 per cent., in the price of all breeds of milch cows. 

Cost of Keep. — Cows are large consumers of food and should not be 
stinted when in milk. Heifers will require nothing but green food in the 
dry summer months ; but as the winter approaches they should be 
sheltered in a yard at night, and a little fresh barley or oat straw 
given them in their cribs ; whenever the pastures become injured by frost, 
both young and old cows require improved food in their sheds. A few 
swedish-turnips or mangold roots should then be given them, which, if 
pulped and mixed with sweet chaff (one-fourth hay), would be sufficient 
to keep them in healthy condition ; but this applies only to those that are 
not in milk. When within two months of calving, all cows should be 
dried, for if not then dried they will not produce so much milk the next 
year. They should afterwards have their food improved by an additional 
weight of roots with their chaff, which should be mixed in a heap over 
night. By the morning it will be found to have heated a little, which im- 
parts a flavour that is much relished by the cows. 

Consimiption of Food. — As was before remarked, " cows are large 
consumers of food/' and no wonder that they should require an abundance, 
to enable them to supply so rich a sustenance for mankind, as well as 
to support themselves. Where there are no good dry pastures to provide 
them with plenty for their summer keep, they would do very well in a proper 
feeding-house (enclosed on the north and south sides) with a door at each 
end, if they were liberally supplied with green food, cut for them and put 
in racks ; such as rye grass, clover, tares, lucerne, or saintfoin. The two 
last grow best on chalky soils. Italian grass would be fit to cut first in the 
spring. It has been found that milk as abundant and butter quite as good 
have been produced by cows so fed, as by those which had the run of 
rich pastures. But where there are pastures it would be well to have the 
cows housed in hot weather, when insects are troublesome ; or else they 
will be worried and heated and unable to feed, and will fall off in their 
produce of milk. 

Coarse grass in low meadows is thought by some people to be proper 
food for milch cows, but it has not been found that the quantity or quality 
of milk produced by cows so fed is equal to that of those which are fed on 
good pasture of a less aqueous quality. 

A large cow will consume a cwt. of green food per day, which could 
not be valued at less than sixpence or eightpence. The general charge 
for pasturage is from 3^. 6d. to 4s. a week each. 

When green food is scarce, as it is sometimes at the end of a dry 
summer, a little linseed-cake or bean-meal, mixed with cut chaff (one 
third hay) should be given them to keep up the produce of milk, lest part 
of the best season for dairying should be lost by its failure. 

It is not good economy to feed cows on much uncut hay, for they 
would consume and spoil a cwt. a day, if fed entirely on it ; which at the 
rate of 4/. a ton would cost 14.S. a week ; neither is it found that any of 
the advertised condiments are worth their cost. Much less expensive and 
more natural condiments can be made by a mixture of bean, barley, maize, 
or linseed meal, and other produce of the soil, by cow-keepers themselves. 

Milk Dairies. — When cows are kept only for the purpose of producing 



Different kinds of Cows. 393 



a large quantity of milk, brewers' grains are given them, with a small 
portion of hay, for ruminating purposes. On this they do tolerably well, 
but it will be found to their advantage if about three or four pounds of 
bean-meal be mixed with the grains for each cow per day. 

Winter Food. — In winter and spring, Swedish turnips, mangold, and 
other root crops would be found more economical food than the grains, 
meal, and hay last mentioned. A bushel of pulped roots mixed with about 
fourteen pounds of cut chaff, one-third hay, and given them twice a day, 
would be found sufficient to satisfy a moderate-sized cow, but they should 
not be stinted or confined to any quantity if they are found to require 
more. Cabbages, carrots, and parsnips are very good food for milch cows 
if given in moderate quantities with other food. It is important that all 
roots should be freed from earth before pulping, or given to the cows, 
otherwise it would impart an unpleasant flavour to the cream. When 
cows are fed on pulped roots, with cut chaff, a peck or two of malt-dust 
(" combs") would be a nice addition, as it would give a zest to the mix- 
ture. A sufficient quantity for the whole herd should be put into a heap 
about twelve hours before it would be wanted, when it would be found to 
have acquired a little warmth and a fragrant smell, which would give the 
cows a greater relish for it. 

A change of green or succulent food appears to promote the secretions 
of the system, and to give stimulus to their action. Such as would in- 
jure the flavour of milk should be avoided. White turnips and cabbages 
will do this, if given without a good supply of other food with them. 

London cow-keepers do not usually keep their cows longer than they 
continue to give milk, but when they have been milked seven or eight 
months, and their milk falls off, they give them an increase of fattening 
food till they are quite dry, when they will have become fat and fit for 
the butcher, and fresh ones are bought to take their places. The best 
milkers are, however, in many cases kept to come in another year, if they 
can be accommodated with the run of a strawyard or pasture ; where 
they might remain if sheltered from inclement weather, till near the time 
of their calving. 

Weaning Calves. — Where there is accommodation for rearing young 
cow stock, the best males and females should be selected for propagating 
a good breed. It would not do, however, for those who expect to make a 
profit by dairy-farming, to purchase animals at the fabulous prices of 
hundreds and thousands of pounds, such as we read of at the sales of 
first-class breeders. Very excellent animals can be found now of various 
breeds, and calves chosen from the best of them, though not very high in 
price, will be as good for dairy purposes as the most celebrated stock. A 
selection should be carefully made from mothers which are the best 
milkers, with full-size udders, wide rounded hips, straight backs, and broad 
chests, with small tapering legs ; and bulls with broad breast, projecting 
a little before their legs, with neck rising from their shoulders, moderate- 
size heads, flat broad straight backs, well filled up behind their shoulders 
and between their ribs and hips, with small straight legs and rounded 
bodies. Large sunken bodies are generally brought on by poor keep. 
Animals kept on straw and sedgy meadows only, while young, are usually 
disfigured by their bodies becoming unnaturally protruded. 



394 Different kinds of Cows. 



Watchfulness required. — When cows are expected to calve (at the 
end of forty weeks) they should be carefully watched night and day, and 
where the weaning of the calf is intended, it would be best for them to 
calve at the end of February or the beginning of March, as they would 
then have the whole of the grass season before them. Calves will soon 
learn to drink from a pail ; but it is generally thought best to allow them 
to suck from their mothers for a few days, while the herdsman milks on 
the opposite side. The cow will give down her milk the better for it, and 
become reconciled to his milking her without the calf afterwards, if 
treated with gentle kindness. 

The calf should have new milk for a fortnight twice a day; then 
skimmed milk mixed with oatmeal or linseed meal, boiled for half an 
hour, during another fortnight or three weeks. It will require about two 
gallons a day till it begins to eat well, which it will do when it is five or 
six weeks old, if some sweet hay be given it daily, or some hay chaff with 
pulped mangold or swedes mixed with it. Skimmed milk, or whey mixed 
with a little linseed meal, will then do for its drink, which may be con- 
tinued till it is twelve weeks old, when it would live very well on a pasture 
or on natural food. Some people wean calves almost entirely on linseed tea. 

Summer Treatment. — When the weather is warm, and the flies become 
troublesome, they ought not to be left in their pasture without shade or shel- 
ter. If well shaded during the heat of the day, and supplied with pure water 
and some green food in their cribs, they will most likely continue to thrive ; 
but if left to be tormented with flies, huddled together in a corner of their 
pasture, or in a wet ditch, they will probably become unhealthy. It may 
here be remarked that on first leaving the cow-house, the calf should be 
confined in a safe place in the yard or elsewhere for a day or two, until it 
becomes accustomed to the bright light of day, as on its first introduction 
it appears almost blind, and would be likely to run into danger. 

A change of pasture now and then is desirable, but calves should not 
be put into low wet meadows, as it is generally in such situations that 
they get diseased with a husky cough.* As the autumn approaches the 
grass will be less nutritious, it will then be necessary to give them some 
food in their yard or shed, such as pulped roots mixed with cut straw 
chaff, every night. A little salt mixed with their chaff is a good thing, 
and is believed by some people to prevent " hove." 

When frost begins they should not be turned into their pasture till nine 
or ten o'clock, or till it disappears. Their racks, cribs, and mangers, or 
whatever they feed or drink from, should constantly be kept clean, and 
the herdsman should be urged to feed and water them regularly, and to 
keep them well supplied with dry bedding. 

As winter approaches they would be best confined to the yard, where, 
if well sheltered and fed regularly with a proper quantity of pulped roots, 
turnips, or mangold, mixed with sweet straw chaff sprinkled with a little salt, 
they will thrive fast enough till the spring, when they can return to their 
pastures, or be provided with green food ; they should be carefully treated 
as before recommended. The upland pastures are best for young stock. 



* Called hove or hoove. See " Diseases of Cows." 



Diseases of Cows. 395 



Some people allow heifers to have calves when only two years old, 
but they seldom (if ever) make such good cows as those that are left free 
till they are three years of age. 

Young stock brought up as here recommended will generally thrive 
fast, and be free from disease. 

Diseases of Cows. 

It is indispensably necessary to have a vigilant experienced herdsman 
at the time that cows are expected to calve. Many a young heifer has 
been spoiled for want of attention at this critical period. When their 
time of forty weeks has expired they should be watched night and day, 
no matter whether old or young.* 

They ought not to have been kept in too high condition, as in such 
cases they would be subject to milk or puerperal fever ; especially if they 
should calve in hot weather, or have a protracted labour. 

When fever comes on they generally refuse food, and are restless, and 
their udders become hard and distended. To prevent this, in hot weather 
and when cows are in too fat a condition, it would be best to have them 
bled about a week or ten days before the time they are expected to calve, 
and also give them a dose or two of Epsom salts. About five pints of 
blood may be taken from a large cow, and four from a smaller ; and the 
Epsom salts should be given in one pound doses, and thoroughly melted, 
with an ounce or two of ginger. Probably it would be best to give one 
dose a few days before calving, and the other a few days after. 

When this fever comes on, the udders become hard and glutted, and 
one quarter of the udder is generally worse than the others, and becomes 
inflamed with garget. This can be subdued only by an early stripping of 
the milk from the quarter, and by a very frequent bathing and rubbing 
with warm water and soft soap. Want of proper attention during this 
state occasions the affected quarter to become hard and useless ever after. 

Cows are often injured by unskilful treatment when the period of their 
gestation has arrived. They should then be placed in a warm, clean, and 
well-ventilated cow-house or shed, moderately fed, and well watched, and 
if all is right they should be left undisturbed ; but if difficulties should 
arise, the veterinary surgeon should immediately be sent for, and his 
practical skill will usually overcome them. 

Hove or Hoove. — The disease called Hove or Hoove is said to arise 



* This necessity has been experienced in several cases by the writer. A few 
years ago, when cows were cheap, 12/. were offered for a small but pretty heifer 
About four or five days before she was expected to calve a cold wind set in, and 
being in an exposed situation in the farmyard, she took cold and had garget. In 
administering a dose of salts the herdsman choked her, so that she died. During 
a cold wintry day, in the early spring of this year, the cows were put into a 
meadow. As was supposed, one of them was about to calve and was driven 
home, und the veterinary surgeon sent for. On his arrival he found the event had 
taken place, and on sending the herdsman into the meadow the calf was discovered 
— of course dead. They should neither of them have been out of their cow-house 
it the time. Both heifer and calf were lost through carelessness. 



396 Diseases of Cows. 

from forcing cattle on too fast, by giving them too rich succulent food ; 
but as we see as many (if not more) poor fed animals affected by the com- 
plaint, it is generally believed to be caused by bringing them up in low. 
undrained meadows, where they get coarse sedgy food without shelter, 
after having been half starved with cold and inferior food during the winter. 

Lime water and turpentine are said to be a cure for this disease, which 
at first seems only to affect the windpipe, but when the insects which are 
the cause of it have reached the lungs, no remedy can be depended on. 

Cattle are believed to be infested by these insects while in their winged, 
mature state, in low marshy grounds. They are first attacked in the 
nostril when they inhale their eggs ; but however this may be, one thing 
is certain, namely, that animals are less likely to become diseased if kept 
on well-drained upland pastures and in good condition. 

Pleuro-pneumonia has been a fatal disease among many herds of 
cattle. It is dreadfully infectious, and an immense number of valuable 
animals have been destroyed by its ravages. If the disease be discovered 
to prevail in the neighbourhood of healthy cattle, they should not be 
removed, but kept at home ; and should any of them show the least 
symptom of fever or disease, they should have a seton in the dewlaps 
of their chest. This is believed to divert the inflammation from their 
lungs by bringing on a copious discharge from their chests. For all lung 
disease it is safest to employ veterinary skill. 

Casualties. — It is common for cattle to get choked when feeding on 
cut turnips or other roots. This is occasioned by the lodgment of a piece 
in their throat or gullet which has not been properly masticated. It 
can sometimes be removed by pressing it forward with the fingers and 
thumb. The safest plan, however, would be for the herdsman to keep a 
proper tube by him which is made for that purpose and covered with 
leather. It is also used to enable cattle to expel wind from their stomachs 
when they are blown by an accumulation of it. This latter cross event is 
very dangerous. It is generally brought on by feeding too greedily when 
first turned into new luscious food, such as coleworts, clover, tares, &c. 
The ruminating process being stopped (because the animal cannot expel 
the accumulation of half masticated food fast enough), wind increases 
rapidly till it becomes so distressed by the distension of its stomach that 
unless speedily relieved it soon dies. 

Remedy for Wind. — A pint of linseed oil generally succeeds in forcing 
a passage into the stomach and in enabling the beast to expel the wind. 

In some extreme cases where no other remedy was at hand, a pen- 
knife has been thrust between their ribs into the stomach. This puncture 
has had the desired effect. The wound soon healed and the poor crea- 
ture's life was saved. 

Very few breeders or feeders of cattle use turnip-cutters now for stall 
feeding. The accidents of choking and blowing seldom occur where the 
improved system of pulping roots is practised. 

Cause of Diseases. — 111 fed and roughly u^ed animals are subject to 
many diseases, which no doubt would be avoided if they were carefully 
fed and properly protected from cold and wet seasons. Wet lodging, 
poor food, and careless treatment are too generally found to be the pre- 
cursors of weak and unhealthy constitutions. 



Milk. 397 

Diseases of Calves. — Calves are often subject to diarrhoea when sucking 
or weaning. The certain remedy is to lessen the usual food and give two 
or three glasses of port wine and a piece of opium about the size of a pea. 
If necessary, you may repeat the dose the next day, and continue it till 
cured. Should the griping return, alter their food and relieve as before. 

Young men and lads who show that they are kindly disposed and feel 
an interest in stock should alone be entrusted with feeding and attending 
to young animals. Food given them either too hot or too cold would prove 
very disastrous. 

A disease known as garget in weaned calves arises from exposure to 
cold, or lying on damp ground and the want of nourishing food, and is 
fearfully infectious. The blood chills and mortification soon follows, 
unless in the early symptoms a seton in the dewlap and good nursing 
should restore the system to healthy action. ' 

Foot and Mouth Disease. — This is generally discovered by cattle 
foaming at their mouths, becoming lame and refusing to eat their food. 
This complaint appears to be brought on by a slow fever. When it first 
appears, give each animal a pound of common salt with half a pound of 
Epsom salts in a quart of water, well dissolved, or for a large animal, 
three quarters of a pound of the latter. The next day give to each, two 
drms. of Chloride of Potash in their water, and continue it every day till 
they are well. Their mouths and feet should be washed twice a day with 
a solution of Blue Vitriol, one ounce to a gallon of water. 

Milk. 

What is milk ? Men of science inform us, " that it is a connecting 
and intermediate substance between animals and vegetables. Almost 
every kind of the mammalia class has something different in the compo- 
sition of its milk. That produced by the cow is well known to be the 
most abundant and valuable of any of them. This white opaque fluid 
has a slight peculiar smell and an agreeable sweetish flavour. It is com- 
posed of water, oil, sugar, curd, acetic acid, extractive, muriates of soda 
and potash, sulphate of potash, and phosphates of lime, magnesia and 
iron." 

When properly set, that is, immediately after it comes from the cow, in 
a shallow earthenware pan, a thick unctuous yellowish substance begins 
to rise to the surface, which we call cream. This is skimmed off at the 
end of twelve or twenty-four hours, and put into an earthen pot, and 
after a sufficient quantity has been collected, it is churned into butter. 
To make cheese the milk should be heated to a certain temperature and 
a little rennet poured into it which will cause it to coagulate into a mass, and 
the curd to separate from the whey ; the solid we call curd and the liquid 
whey. Thus milk is separated into three parts — cream, curd, and whey. 

Butter is usually produced by means of beaters or fans, which are 
made to agitate the cream ; during this process a separation takes place 
between what is called the butyraceous particles and the thin serous 
fluid. The former unites into a mass and is called butter, and the latter, 
butter-milk. 

It is not generally known that a little hot or cold water mixed with 
the cream neither lessens the quantity of butter nor injures its flavour. It 
is merely added to assist in attaining a proper temperature for churning. 



39 8 The Dairy Maid's Duties. 



A Few General Remarks on Milk. — Milk is one of the most useful 
articles of food. It can be equally taken by old and young, and is very 
nourishing. 

Milk or cream is a necessary adjunct to the breakfast table, and 
renders tea, coffee, or cocoa a delicious beverage, and none of our meals 
would be complete without butter. In some form or other milk is present. 
In cream, butter, or cheese, cakes, pastry, etc. 

The constant demand for milk amongst all classes of society keeps up 
its high price, and only a small quantity can be purchased by the poor. 
It is, however, a luxury they generally appreciate, and they usually ma- 
nage to have a little every day. They may not always be able to procure 
meat, but with rare exceptions they can get a little piece of butter and 
cheese, which give a relish to their food. 

It shows God's wisdom and goodness that those things which are 
most necessary are most abundant. 

The Dairy Maid's Duties. 

Punctuality, order, and cleanliness must be observed in all dairy work. 

The dairy-maid should be an early riser, for, in the summer months 
especially, much of her work will have to be done before breakfast. In 
preparing the dairy for use the walls must be whitewashed, the windows 
cleaned, and the shelves scrubbed with cold water and a brush kept for 
that purpose, and never used for the dairy utensils, and the floor nicely 
cleaned. Having heated the copper she must next take her best scrub- 
brush and thoroughly scour every part of the dairy utensils with cold 
water, rinsing them well, and if they are to be used for milk, cream, 
butter, curd, or cheese, afterwards scalding them and placing them in the 
rack and on shelves outside the washhouse door, for the purpose of sweeten- 
ing them, as the air is a great purifier. Next carry them into the dairy 
and place them on the shelves conveniently for use, taking care to keep "a 
place for everything and everything in its place." The milk pans (earthen- 
ware preferred) may be piled in a stack and taken down as wanted. 

Fuller's earth or wood ashes are sometimes used for scouring with 
cold water, but soap must never be used, for it would surely spoil the 
cream and butter. 

Should the herdsman milk the cows, it is necessary to see that they 
are milked perfectly dry, as the richest part comes last, and the dairy-maid 
should be particular to have her clean pans ready to receive the milk, 
which must be set or emptied into them at once. Next she should rinse 
the pail with cold water, and scrub it, and afterwards scald it and wipe 
it with the dairy cloth. The dairy cloth must then be carefully washed in 
cold water, scalded, and hung to dry. This must be done once a day. 
In the evening rinse the pail with cold water and wipe it with the dairy 
cloth. If either the pail or cloth were neglected, it would spoil all the 
cream and butter. 

After the milk has been standing twenty-four hours, the dairy-maid 
will take a skimmer and basin with a spout and proceed to skim the 
cream off, first loosening it round the edge with her finger. Then put in 
the skimmer and take up as much cream as it will hold, allowing the 
milk to drain off before putting it into the basin. This is repeated until 
all the cream has been carefully removed. As the small basin is filled, 



To Chum Butter. 399 



it is transferred from time to time to the cream-pot, into which a piece 
of saltpetre, about the size of a nut, is dropped with the first lot of cream 
only, and stirred with a flat wooden stick, which is left in, as it will be 
required to stir the cream every time any is added. Should the cream be 
more than three days gathering for butter-making, it should be put into 
another clean pot and stirred daily as before. This process gives it ven- 
tilation and it keeps better. 

The skim milk may be used for domestic purposes, bread making, 
puddings, &c, and the remainder (if not sold) may be given to the calves, 
pigs, and poultry with advantage. 

After the milk pans have been emptied, they should at once be care- 
fully washed with the scrub-brush and cold water (hot would only set the 
grease) and well rinsed and dried, and then put away till churning day, 
when they can be thoroughly done with the rest of the things, as they 
must be properly scalded before being used again. There are many 
varieties of churns, such as the barrel, box, air. The latter is the most 
difficult to use, as it requires the milk to be at a certain temperature, and 
if either hotter or colder the butter will not come. The American box 
churn, sold by Messrs. Burgess and Keys, is here recommended as easy 
to use and easy to clean. 

To Churn Butter. 

Fill your churn and butter stand with cold water over night. If sum- 
mer time, and the weather should be very hot, rise about three or four in 
the morning, then skim any pans you may have ready, empty the water 
out of your churn and strain the cream through a clean cheese-cloth into 
it, till three parts full, not fuller, as if too full it would become frothy. 
Then gently turn your handle, lifting the lid of the churn occasionally, 
but oftener at first, to let out the gas, which would prevent the particles of 
cream from uniting into a solid mass, and occasion you much trouble by 
becoming frothy, when you might churn for days and perhaps never get 
butter at all. When you find the butter is collecting, turn the beaters 
slowly up and dash them suddenly down until it is in firm lumps and 
ready for your butter stand. Take them out, and place them in it, after hav- 
ing first emptied out the water and rubbed the bottom with salt and rinsed 
it. Strain the butter-milk through a clean cheese cloth into a pail, carefully 
putting the rest of the butter (if any) into the stand. 

Wash it with fresh spring water, then work it with your boards and 
hands till all the milk is pressed out. Then shape it into pounds or pats 
as you may think proper, and mark it according to taste. Many pretty 
devices a»e now sold for that purpose. Before shaping it, salt it, if re- 
quired, and weigh it. 

In Cambridgeshire butter is made into rolls a yard long, and passed 
through a ring of a certain diameter, for the convenience of dividing it 
without weighing. In some parts it is made into pints. 

Having washed your large dishes with salt and water, you carefully 
place each pound or pat on a dish with your boards as you finish it, and 
put it on a shelf in the dairy. In summer it is dropped into a pail of cold 
water, and left till next morning before placing on the dish. 

Next with cold water and best scrub-brush you carefully wash off 
every particle of milk from your churn, stand, milk-pans, cream-pots, and 
other utensils, and scald the moveable ones in the copper (be sure not to 



400 Devonshire Cream. 

put enamelled ones in, or the heat will expand the outside and cause the 
enamel to crack) ; but those that are too large for that, pour boiling water 
into them, and let it stand in for a time ; then take them out into the air 
and place them in the rack outside, and on the shelf and stool, till they 
are thoroughly sweet. Then replace them in the dairy as before. 

During winter, about twenty minutes before using it pour boiling water 
into your churn to heat it, for if freezing it must be thoroughly warmed ; 
but when the thermometer is above temperate, it will not require it. In 
very severe weather it may be necessary to churn before the kitchen fire. 
Churning should now be done quicker than in summer, and the butter 
should be shaped as soon as possible, or it will become so hard with the 
cold as to be difficult to work. After it is salted according to taste, weigh 
it and make it up at once. 

Summer Temfteratw'e. — In summer it is important to keep the dairy 
cool ; therefore it is necessary to shut the windows and shutters during 
the excessive heat of the day, and to open them in the evening. Washing 
it down with cold spring water twice a day will freshen it and assist in 
preserving the milk sweet. 

Winter Te?nperature. — In winter it is desirable to keep the dairy 
about temperate, therefore the windows may be kept partially, and in case 
of frost wholly closed ; if very severe the shutters must also be shut. 

Necessity of providing Butter for Winter use. — Butter has of late years 
been an expensive article of housekeeping, and as it still keeps up its high 
price, it would be as well, whilst cheap and plentiful during the spring and 
summer, to put some down for winter use. The following receipts will 
be found useful : — 

Salting Butter. — In salting butter the quality of the salt is of great 
importance. It should be of the best quality. Some persons use half an 
ounce of dry salt pounded fine, two drms. of sugar, and two drms. of 
saltpetre to every pound of butter. As a cask or large jar is filled up, 
every fresh quantity is carefully added to the preceding portion. Should 
it shrink away from the sides, melted butter may be poured round it to 
fill it up. 

Without Salt. — Butter may be preserved without salt, by melting it 
very gently, without boiling ; which causes the watery particles to evapo- 
rate, and the curd, which is always present in small quantities, and is a 
principal cause of rancidity, to fall to the bottom. The clear butter is 
then poured into an earthen vessel, and covered with paper and a piece 
of bladder tied over, to exclude the air. Butter thus prepared loses some 
of its flavour, but is much superior to salt butter for ordinary purposes. 

All butter that is produced in this country is consumed here, and a 
large quantity is imported from Ireland, Holland, and other countries. 

The consumption of butter in London is estimated at 15,000 to 16,000 
tons yearly. 

Devonshire Cream. 

In Devonshire, instead of the ordinary mode of raising cream in 
shallow pans, it is put into a tin vessel as soon as it comes from the cow, 
and placed on a stove, to stand there for twelve hours, and then the stove 
is heated. This prevents the cream breaking, by being carried to it. 
The milk should be heated gradually until quite scalding, when a thick 
scum called " clotted cream" is thrown up, but it must not be allowed to 



The Cow House. 401 

boil. The lire should then be put out, and the cream allowed to stand 
twelve hours longer, when it may be skimmed. It may then be readily 
made into butter by beating it by hand in a bowl. 

Another mode which is followed in parts of Holland, Scotland, and 
Ireland, is to churn the milk and cream together, by which it is said more 
butter is produced. 

The Cow House. 

The milking or cow-house should be situated within a short distance 
of the dairy. If it were within a few steps it would be so much the better, 
as the milkers could then empty their pails into the pans while the milk 
was warm. The cream would then rise more quickly and more abun- 
dantly than if left to cool first. Milk is usually poured through a sieve 
or cheese-cloth into the pans, or else strained, before using for domestic 
purposes. Where it is not strained, the cream is always poured through 
a cheese-cloth into the churn. 

Mode of Building. — The building should be at least sixteen feet wide 
inside, to allow good room for stalls and feeding troughs, and for com- 
fortable room behind the cows. Their troughs should be placed three 
feet from the wall, so that their food could be put in on that side of the 
building. It should join the root-house. The floor should be paved with 
bricks, pretty high where the cows would stand, and sloping down to a 
gutter behind them. The gutter should be made with a good fall, so that 
no manure could remain long in it. It would be well if a cesspool could 
be made at a little distance to receive the drainage, so that no effluvia 
from it could reach the milking-house. 

It would be a good plan to have the north and south walls wholly en- 
closed, with the exception of a door for entrance into the turnip and 
chaff-house, and the east and west ends fitted up with double folding- 
doors, in a line with that part of the floor behind the cows. By this means, 
if both ends were left open in the summer, a current of cool air would 
go through the place, and either one or the other might be closed when 
the cold wind came from the east or west in winter. 

The calf-pens would have to be placed at each end. A few air-bricks 
might be put into the south wall, about four or five feet above the cows' 
heads, and a boarded loft over the whole building, the length of which 
would depend on the number of cows kept. If numerous, a row of cow- 
stalls (which might be double), on either side of the building, with a path 
down the middle for the men, would be an advantage. 

The strictest cleanliness should be practised, and clean dry beds pro- 
vided for the cattle when housed, and everything done that is required to 
make them comfortable. 

It would be advisable to have the pastures near the milking-house 
where it is possible, for when they are fetched from a long distance they 
sometimes get hurried, and their milk becomes overheated. Whoever 
drives them should be urged to do it gently, and taught the law of kind- 
ness. Neither whips nor sticks should be used if cows are expected to 
yield their milk down freely. If treated with gentle kindness they will 
become attached to their keeper or herdsman, and will place themselves 
in a quiet position to be milked, even in the open field.

40 2 Hints on Milking — Gloucestershire Cheese. 

It is dangerous to drive cows a long distance when near the time of 
calving. 

Hints on Milking. 

Milking. — Those who milk cows should be well looked after, and in 
large butter and cheese making dairies some trusty person should always 
follow the milkers to watch their proceedings and to ascertain whether the 
cows have been well milked. If a cow has been ill-treated she will leave 
off eating, toss up her head and become restless while she is being milked. 
She would not give down her milk freely if she had been misused by the 
person who was milking, and probably several pints of milk would be 
retained after he had left her. 

Few persons are fully aware of the great loss sustained by cowkeepers 
in consequence of their not employing good milkers. 

It is very important indeed to ensure the certainty of having every cow 
well stripped for two ostensible reasons. One is that the last pint or two 
of the strippings is a great deal richer than that which is first milked. 
Analysts inform us that it is ten times as rich in butter and cheese pro- 
ducing qualities. But another very strong reason why cows should be 
thoroughly well milked is, that they will very soon fall off in the produce 
of their usual quantity if all their milk be not drawn from them. They 
will gradually produce less and less. The portion left by careless milkers 
seems to be absorbed into the system, and nature will continue to generate 
no more than what has been abstracted. If this be the case, and some 
milk be left every day, of course the cow soon becomes dry. Observant 
men have frequently noted this fact, while the owners of the herd have 
been unconscious of it, and have wondered why so little butter and cheese 
have been produced, and why it was that their cows have become dry at 
the end of six or seven months, while their neighbours' cows have con- 
tinued to give a pretty good quantity till within two months of their 
calving. 

It is not the usual custom to milk cows more than twice a day, but it 
has been found that they will give a larger quantity if milked three times. 

However, it is not generally thought worth Avhile to trouble cither the 
servants or the cows during the middle of the day for what extra quantity 
could be produced by this practice. 

It will appear from what has been stated, that kind treatment and 
clean milking are essential requisites in the management of a dairy. 

Cleanliness with regard to milkers is indispensable. Their hands must 
be washed perfectly clean, and should the cow's udder be soiled it must 
be washed clean also. 

If all persons employed in dairy work are clean and careful, their 
butter and cheese are sure to be good. 

Gloucestershire Cheese. 

In the month of April the process of cheese making generally begins, 
though it is not till after the cows are fed in good pastures that the blue 
mould will be on it which is a sign of richness. 

One difficulty to contend against just now is the heaving of the cheese, 
or getting out of shape. This may sometimes be prevented by putting one 
pint of sour whey to forty or fifty gallons of milk and also a little saltpetre. 



Cheddar Cheeses. 4°3 



To the same quantity of milk put a tablespoonful of saltpetre in this 
way. Place it on the cloth which covers the cheese-tub underneath the 
sieve, and strain the milk through it. The saltpetre will then dissolve 
and effectually mix with the milk. 

When the milk is cool enough for the rennet to be put in, which is 
eighty degrees as indicated by your thermometer, it should be allowed to 
stand for an hour without being disturbed. Then it may be cut with a 
knife having three blades, slowly at first, to allow of some of the whey 
being dripped from it. In a quarter of an hour longer, it may be broken 
up very small, without injuring the quality by the fat from the curd being 
carried off by the whey. It will then sink in a solid mass, when the whey 
can be more easily removed. As it is necessary to make the curd as dry 
as possible, it is often put into vats and placed in the press for half an 
hour, after which it is taken out and placed in a tub, and either crumbled 
to pieces with the hand or, which saves the dairymaid much labour, 
ground by a mill placed on the top of the tub, this latter plan being the 
best for regularity. It will now be put into the vats and pressed firmly 
After the cheese has been in the press two hours, the wet cloth must be 
taken off and a dry one substituted, and the cheese turned over. When 
this second one is removed, if the curd be not properly closed up, a third 
may be used before salting. The cheese made at night shot Id be salted 
as early as convenient the next morning, and that made in die morning 
should have the salt rubbed in at night. Thin cheeses will require three 
times rubbing, and thicker ones four. Four or five days in the vat will 
complete the process, though a longer period would be an advantage. 

After taking the cheese from the vat let it be well washed in cold water 
to remove the brine and wiped, or it will fail to acquire that beautiful blue 
mould which is an indication of richness and good quality and will fetch 
the highest price in the market. 

You may now place your cheeses in the dairy for a week, after which 
they may be removed to the cheese-room. Care must be taken not to 
place them in a draughty situation or they will invariably crack. Turn 
them daily, frequently changing to clean shelves. In three or four months 
they will be ready. 

Cheddar Cheeses, 

Pour the milk through a sieve into a cheese tub as it is drawn or 
milked in the evening. But if very hot weather, place large vessels in a 
tank of water, and pour it into them, to cool till morning. These are all 
emptied into the tub with the next morning's milk. To every hundred 
gallons add two to four of sour whey, providing the temperature of the 
night's milk is not over 64 degrees, which must be ascertained by the 
thermometer ; if over, no whey should be added. Heat the whole to 
80 degrees either by warming the morning's milk and putting to the even- 
ing's, or by any easier process. Rennet and a pint of water in which two 
or three square inches of veil* has been twenty-four hours steeping, is 
then strained into it, at the rate of three-quarters of a pint to sixty gallons of 
milk. This must be thoroughly stirred in, also half an ounce of Freeman's

or NicliolFs liquid Annato to every iifty gallons is mixed for colouring. In 
an hour the curd will have come. It is next slowly cut with the curd 
breaker, and a few gallons of whey gently baled out and heated, and then 
added to the mass to raise the temperature again to 80 degrees ; the 
whole now being stirred and broken, and then covered up for three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Ten or twenty gallons of whey are then drawn off, and heated to about 
145 or 150 degrees, and then run into the tub again, raising the heat to 
100 Fahrenheit. It is covered up again for half an hour ; the whey is 
next slowly run off until only a few gallons remain for use the next day. 
The curd is then heaped into the middle of the tub to drain, and left for 
half an hour. It is then cut up, and again left for half an hour to drain. 
It is then weighed, and ground through a mill, and one pound of salt to 
one cwt. mixed with it. When sufficiently cool, at 6o°, it is vatted and put 
into the press. After three days it is bandaged, and placed on a shelf in 
the dairy for a week. It is then removed to the cheese-room, where it 
will require turning, daily at first, and afterwards at longer intervals, 
wiping it when necessary, and occasionally changing it to clean shelves. 

In a month it will be ready for scraping. This is done by moistening 
the cheese with a wet flannel all over, and then scraping it with a knife 
till smooth, but leaving the edges sharp. In about three months' time it 
will be ready for sale. 

Truckle Cheeses. 

Truckle cheeses are usually made in the autumn months, after the 
excessive heat of summer is over ; during which they are liable to heave 
and bulge, owing to fermentation occasioned by the hot weather. 

They are made from six to nine inches deep, and about nine inches 
across, and are recommended as the most convenient size for the table. 
It is not easy to fill vats of this description, they are therefore made of 
small staves like a milk pail or bucket, but without bottom. A piece 
of board rather larger than the vat is kept at the bottom until the cheeses 
are turned out. 

Truckle, or loaf, cheeses have a tendency to bulge at the sides, great 
care is therefore required in making them, for unless well made they will 
not retain their original shape, but lose their beauty. The quality, conse- 
quently, is easily determined by the shape. When the vat is half full, a 
small tablespoonful of fine salt should be put into the middle of the cheese, 
taking care to rub it well into the curd, but not allowing it to reach the 
outside, or it would make it crack. In the formation of these cheeses the 
curd should be made of new milk, crumbled small, and drained thoroughly 
before putting it into the vats, and it should be pressed in as firmly as 
possible with the hands. This done, they are ready for the press, where 
they must remain four or five days, and be turned every day and salted 
three times. In about twelve months they are fit for use. 

Stilton Cheese. 

Put the night's cream into the morning's milk with the rennet as 

before described. When the curd is formed it must not be broken, but 

taken out whole with the skimming dish, and placed in a sieve. As it 

drains gradual pressure should be employed till it becomes firm and dry. 



Cream Cheese — Parmesan Cheese — Leicester Cheese. 405 

It must then be placed in a hoop, and afterwards kept on a board, 
bound with a cheese fillet, and turned frequently. 

Cream Cheese. 
Take some of the curd, as in Stilton cheese, before it has become too 
firm, and, after draining it gently, and pressing it a little, place it on 
cut straws of a certain length strung together. The same quantity of 
straws should be placed on the top. It must be turned every day. In 
three or four days it is ready for the table. 

Parmesan Cheese. 

A moderate wood fire in a stove, adapted for the purpose and placed 
two feet below the surface of the ground, is made at ten o'clock in the 
morning, when sixty-six gallons of milk are poured into a large copper 
kettle suspended from a crane and placed over the fire. The contents 
must be stirred frequently. An hour afterwards, the milk being under 
blood-heat, must be still stirred and have some rennet squeezed into it 
through a cloth. The copper must then be turned from over the fire, and 
remain so till past twelve o'clock, by which time the rennet will have 
operated sufficiently. After being stirred up and allowed to stand for a 
short time, some of the whey should be taken out and the copper put 
over the fire again, which must be made up sufficiently to raise the 
materials to nearly boiling point. Colouring should be then added, viz., 
a quarter of an ounce of saffron. It must still be occasionally stirred 
and the curd frequently examined. In about an hour and half the small 
pieces of curd will be getting firm. When this is the case, the copper 
must be taken off and remain so till the curd has subsided. Part of the 
whey being removed, the curd, which will have become tough and adhe- 
sive, is taken up in a coarse cloth and put into a hoop and pressed for 
half an hour by a 56 lbs. weight. The cloth is then taken away and the 
cheese, left in the hoop, is then placed on a shelf. On the third day, it is 
sprinkled with salt, and this is repeated every second day for about six 
weeks. In order to facilitate the salting, two cheeses are usually placed 
one upon the other. 

Leicester Cheese. 

Put a rack across the cheese-pan or tub and pour the milk through a 
fine hair sieve into it. Ascertain by the thermometer that the milk is a 
right heat, — viz., eighty-four degrees, or the curd will not be a proper con- 
sistency. Rennet and a small quantity of water in which veil has been 
steeping is then strained into it in about the same proportion of that 
mentioned in Cheddar Cheese. 

Put a cloth over it to keep up its temperature and let it stand for sixty 
minutes. If at the end of thirty minutes, the curd has not begun to 
collect at the sides of the pan, add a little more rennet. When the curd 
is properly come, let it be gently broken up by putting the cheese breaker 
slowly down and bringing it up as slowly until it has gone once round the 
basin or pan. The second time it may be passed round a little quicker, 
and the third time put the breaker in at one end and bring it up at the 
other, and so go round. After this process let it remain a quarter of an 
hour. Then the dairy-maid must kneel down and begin to collect the 
curd with her arms and hands before removing any of the whey : by so 



40 6 Green Cheeses. 

doing she will be able to get it firm at the bottom. She must then draw 
the curd towards her which will now occupy half the pan, turn it from 
light to left till opposite, and then gently roll it over, bearing in mind 
that the weight of whey assists with the natural warmth of the arms and 
hands in producing the firmness required. She may then commence 
ladling off the whey, then cut her curd into large squares and lay them 
in a wicker sieve. The pan is now empty, let her put her cheese tongs 
across it and place the vat and cheese hoop on them. Put the large 
lumps of curd into this vat and lay the strainer over it, then place the 
strainer in the centre of the vat and commence at once to break up the 
curd with the hands. The dairy-maid must then take her kneeling-board, 
which is about five inches in width and thirteen long, and placing it over 
half the cheese, must kneel on it while she works the other half with her 
fists, moving it gradually round so that the cheese may be kneaded all 
over. Then she must draw the cloth straight over it corner ways, which 
will enable her to lay hold of both ends and swing or turn it over. 

Then she must tuck the strainer round tight and knead it again as 
before, which will occupy half an hour. Next take the strainer off and 
cut the curd into four large pieces and put them into the wicker sieve. 
She must then dip the strainer in whey, and wring it perfectly dry. The 
dairy-maid must again place the tongs on the cheese pan, and put the vat 
on it, and cheese hoop and the strainer in the centre. She must next 
crumble up a third part of the cheese with her hands, pressing it for 
twenty minutes, then another, break it and press it as before, and lastly 
the remainder in the same way ; bring the corner of the straining cloth 
over it, regulating her hoop so as to be just on the surface. By so doing 
the press will accomplish all that is required. The curd is then put into 
the cheese-press for three hours, and when taken out the strainer is wrung. 
It is then salted, put in again, and left for three or four days ; after which 
the brine is well washed off in cold water and the cheese wiped and 
placed in the dairy for a week, and afterwards removed to the cheese- 
room. 

Green Cheeses. 

A cheese of a dozen pounds may be made as follows. Take two 
handfuls of sage, one of marigold leaves, and a little parsley, and then 
let them be well bruised and steeped in a sufficient quantity of milk. 
The greenish milk must be strained from the mass the next morning, and 
mixed with one-third the quantity to be run. This mixture and the rest 
of the milk are then to be run separately and the two curds kept distinct 
till they are ready for vatting. In mixing, the curds may either be reduced 
small, and blended intimately together, or the green curd may be irregularly 
broken, or else cut into regular shapes. The bottom and sides of the 
vat are then set with these fragments, interspersing the different curds 
with each other, according to the taste of the maker. The middle is then 
filled up with the promiscuous mixture, and at the top the different colours 
are alternately or otherwise disposed, as in the bottom and sides. The 
remainder of the process is the same as that for other cheeses.

THE POULTRY YARD. 



There is no house, however small, with the very least possible piece of 
outlet, that may not, with a little care and trouble, indulge in the luxury of 
new-laid eggs, spring chickens, and fat poultry. We will try to show how, 
in an inexpensive manner and with ordinary care, the poultry-yard may 
prove a source of amusement as well as of profit, 



FOWL HOUSE. 

Having decided on keeping fowls, the first thing to be done is to 
prepare a suitable place for their habitation. Of course the size of the

number you purpose keeping must be regulated by the space at your

command ; but having decided the size to build your fowl-house, which, 
it possible, should have a south aspect, it is well to do so in as cheap a 
manner as possible. The most economical material for building is wood, 
the roof of the same covered with patent felt. This roofing measures 
thirty-two inches wide, and is M. a yard. It is water-tight, but should be 
placed over common boards, as it is apt to bag, and if water settles in the 
hollows it becomes rotten. It is nailed on with hot iron tacks heated in a 
frying-pan, and when it is up, it must be tarred and thickly sprinkled 
with sand, which should be repaired every year. In summer weather a 
felt-covered house is hot, therefore, if possible, it should be erected 
under the shadow of trees. It should be well ventilated, but you must 
avoid the least possibility of a draught. The floor should be perfectly 
dry, and the roof, like our own houses, weather-tight. Sliding-windows 
or air-openings should be made at either end, so as to admit air 
in abundance, but so situated as not to expose the fowls to a current 
of air or draught when they are at roost. The perches should of course 
be round and not too slight — perhaps about the size of a rolling- 
pin ; and the nearer they are to the ground for the heavy description of 
poultry the better. Having completed the fowl-house externally, the floor 
must be next attended to, and as cleanliness is of most particular 
importance in securing your fowls in health and beauty, too much atten- 
tion cannot be paid to this part. There are many opinions as to the best 
flooring for a fowl-house, some recommending stone and bricks: both 
these are too cold ; others, the ground well rammed, and ashes from the 
dust-hole, finely sifted, strewn over it : this plan we adopted ourselves, 
and although it kept the feet of the fowl clean, it was a complete nest of 
and harbour for the insects which are so troublesome to all poultry. The 
best we found, after very many trials, was well-screened gravel well-beaten 
down ; and, having a brickfield hard by, we were enabled to procure the 
refuse from the brick kilns thickly spread over the gravel and well 
rammed down also. Being thoroughly wetted during the process with 
good strong lime-water, it forms a description of concrete. It is of course 
necessary you should not mix your different varieties of fowl, otherwise 
you never can depend upon a pure breed, which to many is the very 
greatest desideratum ; and to obtain that object you must adopt the 
following method : Necessarily you must divide your poultry-house into 
as many partitions as you intend to keep descriptions of poultry. These 
may be made of wire netting, and the run or yard divided in the same 
manner. Should the cocks prove troublesome and inclined to fight, 
boards or wire have to be used instead of netting. The whole of the run 
should be covered also with netting. Hatches must be made in the 
houses for the exit and entrance of the fowls, and these should be made 
to slide so that the fowls may be safely shut up at night. The greatest 
cleanliness must be observed both inside and outside their houses ; baths 
should be cleaned if possible once a day — at the very least twice a week. 
If space allow, a sort of day-shed may be erected at the bottom of the 
run, made up of any description of old rubbish, but sufficiently secure to 
prevent their escape, in which gravel, ashes, refuse of old buildings, and old 
mortar pounded may be thrown, so as to enable them to seek shelter 
from the weather without taking refuge in their roosting-place, and where 
they may also peck up what is so essential to their well-doing, without

which they cannot digest their food, and where they can feather them- 
selves. 

Moveable houses are very excellent for fowls, as new earth is a great 
boon to poultry. If there is land enough to allow of a house of this kind

being removed from time to time, the poultry will thrive all the better /or 
it. Moveable fencing goes with these houses. 

Having fixed upon the description of fowls you purpose keeping, the 
very greatest care must be taken in their feeding. They should have 
sufficient, and no more than sufficient, food, but that which they have 
should be good. Very many people run away with the false impression 
that you cannot overfeed poultry : it is a grave error to do so. In feed- 
ing fowls throw the food to them, and while they are really hungry they 
will run after their food with avidity. When they begin to slacken or begin 
to eat daintily, stop feeding them. One essential of success in poultry- 
keeping is an abundant supply of clean water. Fowls are very particular 
about it. They also, like individuals, require a change of diet : their usual 
food is corn and meal of every description, small potatoes boiled and 
given hot, mixed with boiled barley meal, pollard, cayenne pepper seeds, 
a little Indian corn, crusts of bread fried in fat, and any cuttings of meat 
that may be tainted, or the refuse from making lard, will keep them laying 
the whole year round. Fowls allowed to run about are naturally fond of 
grass and vegetables ; any refuse cabbage-leaves, lettuce, and grass- 
cuttings from the lawn will be most acceptable to them, and should L>c 
thrown into their run. 



4 1 o The Nest. — The Chickens. 



Having housed the fowls and described their food and the way of 
feeding, it is natural to look forward for some reward in the way of eggs 
and chickens. With proper food, such as has been recommended above, 
we are certain to have a good supply of the former. We will show the 
method as adopted by some of the best breeders to raise the latter. The 
first thing is to choose a hen for sitting : that is easily ascertained. When 
you see one of your stock ruffling her feathers, wandering about, trying 
to hide herself in dark corners and out-of-the-way places, and making a 
peculiar sort of " cluck," immediately prepare a nest for her in a quiet 
spot, and place there the number of eggs which she can conveniently 
cover. It depends entirely upon the size of the hen what number of eggs 
you should place in the nest. Select if possible a short-legged hen. The 
number of eggs will of course vary according to her size, from nine to 
thirteen. Should you have two hens " clucking," it is a good plan to sit 
them both on the same day, as when the eggs are hatched the two broods 
may be given over to the charge of one hen ; you will then have the other 
in a short time laying again. 

The nest must be made warm and comfortable ; there must also be 
some degree of moisture. Some old housewives sit their hens on the 
ground, but damp is fatal to hatching. The most simple nest is one made 
of straw, well-softened by rubbing in the hands, fern or heath. You must 
induce the hen to leave her nest every day, and see that she has plenty of 
water and food, and also an opportunity of rolling herself in dust or 
ashes, and picking among gravel or soil. Do not interfere with her more 
than this, as excessive watching will disturb her. The eggs chosen for 
sitting should be from the newest you have ; if you have enough all laid 
on one day, so much the better. At the expiration of twenty-one days, 
if all goes well, you will find your chickens hatched ; if in winter, hen 
and chickens should be comfortably housed — an old shed will do. Place 
the hen under a coop ; a box with one side taken out, with laths nailed in 
front, makes a very excellent and cheap one. Place some chicken food 
in front of the coop. Whilst very young they should be fed every hour, 
and any stale food they may have left should be removed ; as they grow, 
the number of meals may gradually be reduced until they are fit for fat- 
tening. The best food for very young chickens is hard-boiled eggs, bread- 
and-milk, millet, rice (boiled), and canary seed. With the chicken as with 
the fowls, the greatest cleanliness must be observed, and their water- 
pans should be replenished two or three times a day. The best age for 
sitting a hen is from two to five years, and in selecting the hen you should 
choose one that has proved a good brooder, and keep the giddy and care- 
less ones solely for laying. Many people select fowls as sitters that have 
tufts on their heads. Every year some fine young fowls should be reared, 
to keep up a stock of good breeders ; by attending to this, and feeding 
bad layers and careless nurses, you will insure a good and profitable 
stock. Should you be inclined to sit a hen on any other description of 
eggs than her own, be most careful in placing her eggs as many days 
after the others as there is difference in the length of their sitting. Have 
wormwood and rue conveniently situated near your poultry-house ; some 
of the former, boiled and sprinkled over the floor of the house, is an ex- 
cellent thing. Pills made of chopped rue and butter are by some con- 
sidered a panacea for all the ailments to which fowls are subject. Moisture, 



Food for Chickens and Fowls. 411 



as before shown, is absolutely necessary to insure success, as well as 
being a means of insuring quick hatching — which is of great consequence, 
as many chickens die from inability to escape from their shell. During 
wet, warm weather the eggs will not require any interference with ; but in 
hot, dry, parching weather, a little assistance must be given, by sprinkling 
the eggs during the absence of the hen, when feeding, with tepid water, 
and watering with a water-pot in the neighbourhood of the nest, to create 
a moist, steamy atmosphere. Should it be necessary to give assistance 
to the chick in its endeavour to quit the shell, care must be taken that 
the time has really arrived when assistance should be given. If on break- 
ing away the shell the least shadow or sign of blood should be seen, stop 
immediately — the chicken is not ready to leave the shell ; by persisting 
you would most certainly cause the death of the chick. If the chick be 
ready to leave the shell, but unable through the dryness of the weather, 
and consequent hardness of it, he will assist you in your attempts to 
bring him into light. Do not neglect to feed your poultry regularly with 
good and solid food from the first Those hens you intend to keep for 
laying should be fed on Indian corn-meal, and those for market or for the 
table should have more nourishing food. It is a great mistake to pur- 
chase what is called chicken's corn for fowls, as it is generally little more 
than husk, or corn so shrivelled that there is no nourishment in it. Good 
wholesome corn, every description of the best meal — such as barley-meal, 
Pollard's buckwheat, oatmeal, cayenne pepper-seeds, and greaves — made 
into cakes, and given hot, is one of the most fattening and flesh-making 
foods for poultry. Little chickens thrive best if they are given chopped 
nettles, with a little butter-milk thrown over them. 

The following is a food on which our poultry will fatten very quickly. 
Put a sufficient quantity of rice to feed the fowls you wish to fatten in a 
saucepan, with some skimmed milk ; let it boil until the rice is perfectly 
swelled out, and then add a little sugar. Feed them three times a day in 
earthenware pans, giving them only as much as will quite fill them at 
once. Let the pans be washed out in spring water, that no sourness 
may be conveyed to the fowls, as that will prevent them fattening ; give 
them the milk the rice was boiled in, and clean water, to drink. By 
adopting this plan the flesh will have a clear whiteness, which no other 
food gives ; and when it is considered how far a pound of rice will go, 
and how much time is saved by this method, it will be found to be cheap. 
A little animal food mixed with vegetable food also causes poultry to 
fatten rapidly, but before these are killed they should for a few days have 
a purely vegetable diet. Another method of fattening fowls is by cram- 
ming them, which no doubt fattens them very shortly ; by this method 
you may have fowls ready for table or market in a fortnight, the fowls 
weighing from five to seven pounds. A good fattening food for fowls 
may be made as follows : — Mix the different meals together with boiling 
water ; then add suet, knead all together, and give in balls as much as will 
rill each fowl. By this treatment they will fatten very rapidly, and this food 
makes them look beautifully plump, and consequently they are eagerly 
sought for in the market. 

We will now say a few words as to the different descriptions of fowls, 
pointing out which are the best layers, the best for sitting, and the best 
and finest for the table. 



412 Spanish, Dorking, Cochin China Fowls, 



It is very hard to disabuse some people of their prejudices, and many 
good old-fashioned people, when you ask them what description of fowl 
they consider best, invariably reply, "The old barn-door." Doubtless, 
they are a useful sort, but in these days of progress poultry-keepers gene- 
rally like to keep pace with the times ; and it is no more expense to keep 
fowls that will lay eggs all the year round, half as large again as the old 
barn-door and produce chickens in March the size nearly of a common 
fowl. 

We will commence with the Spanish — a most elegant breed, jet black, 
with a white face, extending in the male bird all over the face and even 
under the beak The hens of these fowls never sit, so the eggs must be 
placed under a common hen. There is one drawback in the Spanish 
breed of fowls — the chickens when young are very delicate, and greater 
care must be devoted to them ; they amply repay the trouble, as the hens 
lay larger eggs than any other kind of fowl. There are several varieties 
of Spanish ; the white Spanish ; the red-faced white Spanish (these latter 
are very good layers, and commence early) ; the Minorca, a Spanish 
fowl, but without the white face — their eggs are large, and they will sit ; 
lastly, there is the Andalusian, very fine-looking fowls : these also are 
very good layers. 

The Dorking fowl, which may easily be known from all other varieties 
of fowl from having five toes, is, in our opinion, one of the best fowls a 
poultry-breeder can possibly have. It is described as being an excellent 
farm-yard fowl, being a good layer, a close sitter, an attentive mother ; 
the chickens also grow rapidly, and are most excellent for the table. The 
Cochin China is also a very great favourite with poultry-feeders ; their 
large size, and the number of eggs the hens lay, naturally led to their 
becoming in great request ; it matters not how cold the weather may be, 
even in deep snow, and with severe frost, you may always depend upon 
your handsome Cochins providing you with new-laid eggs. 

There is another description of fowl which no breeder should be 
without, and that is the Bramah Pootra ; they are good layers, their 
eggs are a very good size, and they make capital mothers ; of all the fowls 
we have ever kept, they are undoubtedly the best. If at liberty, they will 
almost keep themselves ; and even if confined, they thrive as well as any 
other fowls. They fatten quickly, and are most excellent eating ; they 
run to a tremendous size; when full-grown they have been known to weigh 
from twenty to twenty-five pounds a pair. Dr. Bennett, in describing 
them, says : " The cock is mostly white, with neck hackles pencilled with 
black, and rump hackles of the palest possible shade of straw colour ; the 
tail is black, with glossy green plume feathers ; the wings pencilled with 
black. 

" The pullets are white, with black tails ; the wings and neck slightly 
pencilled with black, the comb is small and serrated. Very frequently 
they have a perfect pea-comb, which is always a rare indication of 
fineness of flesh. The wattles are small, but the ear lobes are extremely 
large and pendulous. The legs are yellow, and usually very heavily 
feathered, though there are some excellent specimens with smooth 
legs." 

Another writer describes them better than they have ever been de- 
scribed before, and in comparing them with the Cochin China goes on to 



Bramah Pootra. — Malay. — Game Fowls. 4 1 3 

say : " In the shape of Cochin China fowls, no one can fail to remark the 
absence of breast, which is indeed one characteristic, as the lack of it 
enables the fluffy thigh to become more apparent ; and the wedge-like 
shape of the bird, while wide behind and tapering to the breast, forms the 
development of those points which constitute the chief beauties in that 
breed. Now in the Bramah Pootra this lack is materially supplied, 
inasmuch as there is a breast amply developed, and possessing a rotun- 
dity approaching, when in hand, to what game-fowl breeders and 
amateurs call cleverness, which is that a well-proportioned fowl, placed 
breast downwards on the palm of the hand, should balance. This cannot 
be when the breast is wanting. A lady lately imported some of these 
birds, and after they had been in charge of the man (who had had the 
care of the Cochins for years) some days, asked his opinion. 'Madam,' 
said he, 'these will get fat where the Cochins will starve.'" The Cochin 
seeks its roost early, and besets the hen-house door ; the Bramah Pootra 
always roams far from home till almost dark. We have seen them, like 
rooks, following a man at the plough, and pecking in the newly turned 
furrows three fields from home ; such a thing is seldom or never seen in 
others. The chickens are all hatched either black or yellow ; at the age 
of six weeks a change takes place — the black get gradually grey, and look 
as if their feathers were covered with a cobweb, while the yellow become 
white and then speckled like a silver-pencilled Hamburg chicken. They 
are very hardy, less expensive to keep, and are quite as prolific in eggs as 
the Cochins. 

MALAY. 

The Malay fowl is a fine, handsome looking fowl, stands tall, and has 
a very upright gait. On looking at its comb, you would almost imagine 
it had been dubbed, as is done with game cocks ; but one is led to see the 
necessity of this naturally dubbed comb, as there is no fowl so quarrelsome 
as the Malay. They have been known, when placed in front of a looking- 
glass, to severely injure themselves in fighting with their shadow. The 
chickens are, perhaps, the most ungainly looking things when young that 
can possibly be imagined ; half fledged, for they fledge slowly, with long 
legs, they have the appearance of a young stork without the long bill. 
The pullets lay very early, and the eggs are a nice medium size and have 
a tinted shell. It is always advisable, if you wish to propagate the breed, 
to place your sitting of Malay eggs under a Dorking hen — the long legs of 
the Malays are very much in the way in sitting, whereas the short-legged 
Dorking can leave her nest without disturbing or cracking the eggs. 

GAME. 

The Game fowl may justly be called the pure British fowl, and there is 
no breed of fowl that can in any way compare with the Game in the 
delicacy, whiteness, and richness of flavour. How grand the Game cock 
looks with his gorgeous black and red plumage, proudly strutting, and 
yet attentively watching his female train, and, like a good soldier or 
citizen, always ready to protect them from harm. Some are very spiteful. 
We had one that took such a hatred to a servant that he could never 
cross the yard without a stick. On one occasion having neglected to do

so, hearing shrieks, I looked out of rny dressing-room window, and then 
saw the cause. The cock had flown up to this tall man's throat, h.9.d 
firmly fixed his toes in his waistcoat, and was pecking furiously at his face. 
A few minutes' more delay and he might have been deprived of his eye- 
sight. Nothing can daunt the spirit of the thoroughbred game cock, for 
when unable to move, and lying wounded to death, he will crow for 
crow with his conqueror as long as life lasts. 

The hens are beautiful birds, marked in many instances exactly like 
a partridge. The chickens, from their earliest infancy, are pretty also, 
and their pugnacity is shown from the moment their combs begin to 
grow. The eggs have a most delicious and delicate flavour, but are, 
generally speaking, of a moderate size. Many people object to keeping 
game fowl on account of their fighting propensities, as very many in- 
stances have been known where a whole brood have been destroyed as 
soon as they were completely feathered, by the cocks and hens (for they 
fight indiscriminately) tearing each other's eyes out, stripping the skin off 
each other's heads ; in fact, so wounded, bruised, disfigured, and injured 
do they become that it has been necessary to wring their necks, so that 
the expectation of the breeder has been utterly disappointed, and his 
eggs and time in the hatching wasted. 

HAMBURG. 

We will now devote a short time to the different descriptions of 
Hamburg fowls, or more commonly called every-day layers, or everlasting 
layers. They are most profitable fowls to keep, as they eat little and lay 
incessantly. If space permit, and they be allowed to ramble, they will 
entirely provide for themselves. There are several varieties. 

The spangled Hamburg, gold and silver. The markings on the 
feathers of these birds are very curious, being a black spot upon each 
gold or silver feather. The comb is also most peculiar in shape, a bright 
red-rose comb, ending in a taper spike at the back end. 

The pencilled Hamburgs arc indeed beautiful birds, the markings 
on their feathers being so minutely exact. Instead of a black spot on 
each feather, a regular pencilling of black appears on the gold or silver, 
as the variety may be either golden or silver pencilled Hamburgs. 

The black Hamburg is a most attractive looking bird : brilliant jet 
black, with its bright red-rose comb and pointed spike, and its being, 
like the other breed of Hamburgs, a constant layer, will generally insure 
it a prominent place amongst the poultry-keeper's stock They are not a 
large fowl, but of a good medium size. The pencilled and black arc 
rather smaller, generally speaking, than the spangled, but all lay equally 
well. 

POLISH. 

One of the most extraordinary looking fowls is the Polish. They 
are generally great favourites, from their useful quality as layers, 
and from the pretty top-knot or tuft on their head. They are compact in 
shape, full round-breasted, and look well on the table. There are several 
varieties of them. 

The white-crested black is a beautiful fowl, dark black, glossy 
plumage, with its completely white tuft, in the perfect breed. There 



La Fleche. — Crci 'ccoiuf. 4 1 5 

should not be a feather of any other colour in the tuft ; the pure white is, 
however, rarely met with, as it is generally mixed at the edges with a few 
black feathers. 

The golden Poland is truly a handsome bird. Every feather in this 
description should be golden, from the tuft to every feather of the bird. 

Mr. Richardson gives the following description of them : — " The 
spangled Polish is a bird of extraordinary beauty, extremely rare, and 
difficult to procure. This fowl presents a symmetrical and regular com- 
bination of the following colours — viz., a bright orange, a clear white, a 
brilliant green, and a jetty black, softened down with rich pure brown, 
every feather being tipped with white, so as to produce the effect whence 
has been derived the name of spangled. The colour of the hen is a 
prevailing golden yellow, with white spangles like the cock. In the cock 
the thighs are black, and are likewise, though in a less degree, marked 
and spangled with black and golden yellow. The hinder end of the 
body is furnished with green and orange brown hackles, and the tail is 
carried well up. The flesh of these birds is of good quality, and they are 
very prolific. They have no comb or beard, the top-knot is white, and 
the legs clean and of a bluish slate colour/' 

LA FLECHE. 

A class of fowl lately introduced from France is a bird of extra* 
ordinary appearance, from the fact of the comb, which never varies 
either in cock or hen, being so dissimilar to that of the combs of other 
fowls ; it is more like a pair of straight horns. They are, however, a very 
handsome, hardy fowl, with a bold carriage, are reared with facility, and 
are profitable to the dealer as well as to the housekeeper, as they grow 
and fatten quickly, are soon ready for market, and lay very large 
eggs. La Fleche is a black fowl— jet-black in fact— looking like black 
polished marble ; and what adds to its extraordinary appearance is the 
fact of the face being nearly completely free from feathers and of a bright 
red, whilst the ear lobes arc large, almost disproportionate, and quite 
white. These birds are more suited for our climate than either of the 
French breeds lately introduced. They are also more stylish in their 
appearance, and, although they stand up from the ground, they cannot be 
denominated leggy, from the fact of their breasts being full and their 
bodies nicely balanced. 

CBEVECOEUR. 

This is another class of French fowl, but not so worthy of considera* 
tion for a poultry breeder as the last, as they have not the style in the 
first instance, and are not so well adapted to our changeable climate. It 
is necessary they should be kept in as warm a situation as may be 
possible. They are a very good fowl for the table, and the pullets fine 
and ready for disposal at an early date. They also lay very good eggs 
and do not sit, which to many people is considered a very great con- 
sideration. They differ from the Fleche fowl in appeaiance, as, although 
they are black, or nearly so, they have a large crest on the head, in 
addition to which they have the spikes or horns which distinguish La 
Fleche in front

THE HOUDON 

io the last we shall mention, and from our own experience, and that of 
others, we cannot say it will ever become a decided favourite, as it has 
iess to recommend it than any French visitors we have been favoured with. 

BANTAMS. 

Before quitting the subject of fowls, we must describe a few of the 
various classes of bantams. Who can have failed to observe the proud 
strut of the bantam cock, surrounded by his diminutive train of hens ; he 
looks like a Turk in his seraglio. To have a perfect breed of 
them, they cannot be too diminutive, although by some persons they 
are looked upon as useless, from the fact that there is not very much to 
eat on a fowl which, at the largest, would not much exceed one pound in 
weight ; their flesh is rich and delicate, and their eggs, though small, 
are truly delicious. How tempting to one recovering from illness ex- 
perience only can tell ; when a large egg would have caused nausea and 
disgust, the little bantam egg, from its size alone, amuses and tempts 
the appetite. 

The prettiest class of all is the Sebright bantam, raised and produced 
by the late Sir John Sebright. They are of two sorts, the gold-laced and 
the silver-laced. The former have, as their name indicates, a pure 
golden colour; the latter, a white, approaching French white. Each 
feather is as distinctly marked, or at least should be, with a lacing or 
edging of black, as if the painter had been called upon to exercise his 
art and add to the already beautiful appearance of the bird. The ban- 
tam cock (pure) throws his head back with such apparent pride in himself 
and disdain of others, that his little head, surmounted by a rose comb, 
nearly touches his squarely-cut tail. The wings also, instead of being 
firmly fixed to the body as in other descriptions of poultry, hang loosely, 
in a sort of jaunty manner, until they nearly touch the ground. They 
have blue legs. One can scarcely see them for their wings. They are 
very pugnacious, and have a lion's spirit in a very small body. The 
convenience of keeping bantams is that where there is little space you 
may find room for a few, and tending them, and breeding them (it is a 
little difficult to do so), may tend to amuse and pass away many an hour 
which might otherwise prove wearisome and full of ennui. 

The Game bantam, as its name indicates, is the game fowl in minia- 
ture. Take the black-breasted red, a minikin fowl, with all the pure 
points of the Derby breed — black breast, a purple band across the wing, 
its plumage hard and crisp, close-fitting and glossy, making the little game 
bantam look really smaller than he is. 

Black and white bantams, as their name also indicates, should be 
black and white, and, like all bantams, should be as diminutive as possible 
in size, with double combs and full tails. 

The White bantam, or feather-legged bantam, is now extremely rare. 
This bird was the pet of our ancestors in days gone by. These bantams 
should be very small, falcon-backed, and feathered with long quill feathers 
to the extremity of the toe, thus differing from Cochins, that are only 
feathered on one side of the leg. 

Fowls are subject to various diseases, and almost all they suffer from 



Diseases of Fowls. 417 



may be attributed either to improper feeding 
as to their houses, their runs, or their water, and in some measure to our 
variable climate. Fowls in pens, even kept scrupulously clean, are subject 
to attacks of apoplexy, and a fine bird may be thus lost, as no premonitory 
symptoms show themselves to allow of any treatment whatever, even if 
their possessor be a most skilful adept in the management of poultry. We 
have often known a fine healthy bird drop dead from his perch. It may 
probably arise from over-feeding, and not being able to take the exercise 
birds in their natural state do in searching for food, inflammation of the 
brain sets in, and they are dead in an instant. Be careful, then, in feed- 
ing, not to overdo it, but feed merely in proportion to the exercise the fowls 
have the opportunity of taking. 

Many chickens are lost from what is called the pip. This disease is not 
where it appears to be, but in a derangement of the alimentary canal. Pip 
is easily discovered by the appearance of the tongue, which is much thick- 
ened, as is also the palate, which causes a difficulty in breathing, and makes 
them gasp as if choking. You find them unable to eat, their feathers be- 
come ruffled, the fowl pines, and at last dies. The remedy which has gene- 
rally proved successful is to place the chick in a warm place; give it clean 
wholesome food of bread and milk, fresh vegetables chopped small, with 
some boiled potatoes mixed with oatmeal, all blended well together, and 
plenty of pure water. A little castor oil (always a safe medicine) may be 
given ; and if a tooth-wash, composed ui borax, myrrh, and water, be at 
hand, dilute some and apply it to the tongue and palate, but on no account 
remove the thickness with the nail, or in any forcible manner. With care 
and attention to this treatment you may save, in almost every instance, 
your chicken from death consequent on the attacks of pip. 

Gapes are very fatal to the generality of poultry ; and although not gene- 
rally known, this disease arises from the presence of a worm in the wind- 
pipe. The symptoms are easily discernible. The voice is completely 
altered, the eyes appear full of water, you observe a running at the nose, 
they have no relish for their food, mope about, and at last die. We have 
tried several remedies, and in most cases with success. The first thing 
to be done is to remove those affected from the remainder of the stock ; 
place them in a dry, warm room, and, taking each bird separately, puff 
tobacco smoke down its throat. This causes expectoration, and in many 
instances causes the worms to be dislodged. A little Scotch snuff may 
also be thrust down the throat. Others have used salt as a remedy. A 
little sulphur should be put into the water ; and even with their meal a 
little powdered sulphur and ginger has often proved beneficial. We have 
also tried gin, or, if not at hand, a little spirits of turpentine, mixed with 
their food, and made into pills. Where poultry are improperly fed, or if 
the fowl-house be not properly ventilated, or if the house and run be not 
kept scrupulously clean, and if attention be not paid to giving a good sup- 
ply of ground mortar and ashes, gapes will prove the cause of a very swift 
decrease in your stock of poultry. 

Fowls are also subject to inflammation of the lungs, and if you can cure 
them of it you must be cautious of breeding from them ; for although with 
care you might bring the fowl into an apparently healthy state, it would 
prove useless as a breeder and unfit for food. Fowls suffer as much from 
moulting as from any complaint they are subject to, as may be imagined 

E E

from its causing an entire change (gradually though) of their plumage. 
During this change you can expect no eggs ; and while the process is 
completing itself they must be kept warm, a generous diet given them, 
and above all things clean water ; a rusty piece of iron should be placed 
in it. Pills made of cayenne-pepper and meal should be given them in 
addition to their food ; it will throw a warmth into their system. Should 
they appear to suffer much, as chickens frequently do, a little chopped meat 
and parched corn may be given with advantage as part of their food. 

With these few remarks we here close what wc have to say as far as re- 
gards fowls, being well assured that a strict attention being paid to the 
simple rules laid down as to feeding and cleanliness, will insure the 
poultry-keeper a reward which will well repay him for any trouble or ex- 
pense he may have experienced or incurred. 

DUCKS. 

Ducks may be kept at a trifling expense, and although it has been laid 
down as a sine qua 11011 that to attempt to keep them without having a 
pond on the premises is absurd, we are able to assert from the experience 
of years that they will thrive and do well without one. A duck will eat 
almost anything and everything, and although a gourmand, is in no way 
fastidious as to the description of food. All refuse from the house, 
vegetables, green or otherwise, boiled with meal, and put into pans as 
often as they are empty, is all they require. They will fatten themselves. 
A place of shelter must be provided for them. One part of a fowl-house 
will answer the purpose well, separated from the other part with wire 
netting, so that the fowls may not have the opportunity of roosting over 
them. A little water will of course prove advantageous. We sank an 
old tub that had been used for scalding pigs in the ground, well puddled 
the outside with clay to render it water-tight, and in this miniature pond 
our ducks throve in a most astonishing manner. W T e were always very 
successful in rearing early ducks. Their price in early spring well repays 
any trouble or expense (in moderation) you may incur. Ducks will not 
bear confinement. They must be allowed to ramble about in the fields or 
in the garden. They will do no mischief there, being very fond of slugs 
and snails. They do very much more good than one gives them credit 
for. Be careful there are no rat-holes near the place you have selected to 
keep your ducks, as, if there be rats on the premises, you will have but a 
very poor account of your ducklings. We lost the greater part of a 
brood in one night. The bedding most suited for ducks is straw, rushes, 
fern-leaves, or haybands opened out. This should be cleaned out every 
morning. One good drake will be perfectly content with from four to five 
ducks, as it is only since the civilization or domestication of the duck that 
he has become a monogamist, as in the wild state they pair and are 
most constant and attentive to each other, until the duck begins sitting, 
when the drake leaves Ihe female and joins any other drake whose family 
affairs keep the duck closely occupied at home. Many people are in the 
habit of placing duck's eggs under a hen. For rearing early ducks this is 
a very good plan to adopt, as you more frequently find a hen wishing to 
sit early than a duck ; but to insure early ducklings, a little care must 
be taken with them. In a cow-house, if possible, have some pens or 



Gcesc. 



■419 



hutches nailed against the wall, just large enough to hold two or three 
ducklings, and let these be fed regularly several times a day, and in a few 
weeks they will be fit for market or table. They must be kept scrupu- 
lously clean, or they will be liable to cramps, and you will find their limbs 
distorted. In Buckinghamshire, famous for its breed of Aylesbury ducks, 
many cottages are in the early spring converted into breeding and rearing 
houses for early ducks on the plan above described. From nine to eleven 
eggs should be placed under the duck, according to its size. If a very 
large bird twelve or even fourteen may be placed under her. The nest 
should be comfortable, made of broken straw. As ducks will always 
cover their nests when they leave them, to hide the eggs, it is better 
to leave a little loose hay about that she may do so when quitting her 
nest to take her morning bath and her necessary food. When the 
ducklings are hatched they should not be allowed to go into the water too 
early, as having no feathers then, but merely down, they soon get 
saturated and drowned. When once they are fledged they cannot by any 
possibility become wet, as their oily feathers throw off the water. Ducks 
will travel a long distance in search of water. They have been known to go 
upwards of a mile for it. It is well to ascertain before you allow them to 
frequent such ponds that there are no pike or eels there, as very often a fine 
duck will be carried off by the former, and young ones carried off by the 
latter. It is very interesting to watch them on their journey to and from 
the pond, following each other in single file like troops in a narrow defile. 
Do not be anxious about your ducks if they are absent all day ; in 
the evening they will return full of food without any expense to their 
owner. 

Ducks begin to lay generally in February, and the eggs should be 
taken away as soon as laid, leaving one always as a nest egg, which 
should be plainly marked. As soon as you see the duck inclined 
to sit, let them remain. A duck sits thirty days, and during that time it 
will require but little attention, except to see there is food at hand for 
the duck when she leaves her nest. It takes about three weeks to fatten 
the young ducks, or in fact any ducks. Leave plenty of food for them 
about ; however coarse it may be matters not. If you have water near at 
hand on your own premises, so much the better. Their laying-places 
should then be placed as near the water as possible. Small wooden 
houses, divided in the middle with a door at each end. An old box 
makes a very good and inexpensive duck-house. Although water is the 
duck's natural element, when weak and young they should be placed 
under cover, as they are very liable to cramp before they are properly 
fledged. 

GEESE 

Are without exception the least expensive poultry to keep. If they can be 
permitted to roam about at large, their great delight is to wander into 
green lanes and peck about in the ditches at the side of the road. The 
largest description of geese are of course the best, as also are the white 
and grey. The time geese sit is generally thirty days, but in mild weather 
you may expect a hatch a few days sooner ; let them have plenty of food, 
such as scalded bran and oats twice a day ; that is, early in the morning 
before they commence their ramble, and in the evening on their return? 

E E 2 



42 o The Turkey. 



All poultry fetches a good price early in the season in the London market, 
high prices being given for green geese. The best and quickest food for 
fattening geese is oatmeal and peas, or any good grain mixed with skim 
milk or buttermilk. It is a waste of time to give bad corn. Begin to 
fatten when about six weeks old. Feed well for about three months 
on this description of food, and the green geese will well repay you. 
As with other poultry geese must be kept perfectly clean, and punctually 
fed. You will generally find that one gander will be sufficient for four or 
five geese. During the time the goose is sitting, the gander is a perfect 
model, sitting by her the whole time, and very determined to shield her 
from harm. They are at these times very spiteful. When the goslings 
are hatched, they should be penned for a few days with the goose on a 
dry grass plot, and she should have plenty of food within easy reach of 
her and the young ones. Any green vegetables chopped small, oatmeal 
made into cakes and broken small, and similar food will soon cause them 
to thrive. Surrey and Lincolnshire produce thousands of geese every year, 
Lincolnshire more especially. Some years since, before the Continent 
was opened to us for traffic of every description, we depended entirely 
upon our home supply of geese. Pennant, in his description of the 
goose, after showing the way they breed and rear geese in Lincolnshire, 
gives us an insight into the cruelty (for such it appears to us to have been) 
practised in plucking the geese for their feathers. The geese are plucked 
five times in the year. The first plucking is at Lady-day for feathers and 
quills, and the same is renewed four times more between this and 
Michaelmas for feathers only. The old geese submit quietly to the opera- 
tion ; but the young ones are very noisy and unruly. We once saw this 
performed, and observed that goslings of six weeks old were not spared, 
for their tails were plucked, as we were told, to habituate them early to what 
they are to endure. If the season prove cold, numbers of the geese die 
by this barbarous custom. When the flocks are numerous, about ten 
pickers are employed, each with a coarse apron up to his chin. Vast 
numbers of geese are driven annually to London to supply the markets, 
among them are the superannuated geese and ganders (called the cog- 
mags) which, by a long course of plucking, prove uncommonly tough and 
dry. 

THE TURKEY. 

The turkey is a bird so well known, it is almost superfluous to describe 
it ; for who is there that has not heard the gobble-gobble of the noble- 
looking turkey-cock, with his proud, defiant strut, his widely-expanded 
tail, his neck like the brightest coral, and the quickly-changing colours of 
the skin of the head when aggravated by the sight of such a colour as a 
scarlet or red coat, cloak, or petticoat. The cocks are decidedly quarrel- 
some and vindictive, and have no really kindly feelings towards the hens, 
as they attack them indiscriminately. A game cock, though smaller in size, 
has been known often to give this farmyard bully a thrashing such as 
could scarcely be imagined from its comparative smallness ; but being 
large and heavy, the turkey cocks are unable to use their spurs with the 
same activity as the game cock. When young, turkeys are very delicate, 
and require the very greatest attention. Some people recommend that 
three peppercorns should be put down the chicks' throats as soon as 



The Turkey. 



hatched ; it can do no harm, and as it is necessary to remove every chick 
from the nest as soon as hatched, it may be as well to give the pepper- 
corns, as they may incite a little warmth in the chick. Place them as 
they leave the shell, in a basket with wadding, warm flannel, and feathers, 
and as soon as all are hatched, put them under the hen. Do not at- 
tempt to feed them or cram them for some three or four hours after they 
are hatched ; by attempting to cram them you may cause injury to the 
beak, which (as may be imagined) is naturally very tender. Very shortly 




The Common Turkey 

you will see the chicks looking for food, so some must be placed conve- 
niently for them, and the more simple the variety the better ; for instance, 
eggs boiled hard, cheese-parings cut small, in fact, minced ; bread-and- 
milk, with chopped wormwood or boiled nettles, are rubbed together and 
made into a sort of dry paste— the tops of onions with a little chopped 
parsley may be added. The hen turkey makes a bad mother ; she will 
often go about with one chick, and leave the remainder, or tread upon 
them and kill them. The food must be thrown to the chicks alone^ as 



422 The Turkey. 



the hen is so greedy she will devour it all else. You may vary the food 
for turkey chicks by giving them potatoes boiled and mashed, mixed with 
roasted turnip, kneaded into a paste with barleymeal or oatmeal. Do 
not neglect a plentiful supply of clean water, in pans very shallow to pre- 
vent the possibility of their falling in, as wet at that early stage is most 
injurious to them. It will be necessary to keep both hen and chicks under 
cover for a week at least, and when they are allowed out with the hen, 
watch them with a careful eye, so that they may not be exposed to the 
fatal effects of showers of rain ; as they grow they will gain experience, 
and will make for shelter on the first threatenings of a shower. You 
should also be careful not to allow them out too early in the morning, 
before the dew is off the ground, or to allow them to remain too long in 
the evening ; they should be housed before the dew begins to fall. When 
your chicks are about two months old, you will be able to distinguish the 
hens from the cock birds, the latter showing growth of comb and the 
rough coral appearance on the neck. You must now be more than ever 
watchful, as your chicks are chicks no longer, but turkey poults. If it is 
your desire to have a good strong, hardy brood of turkeys, good feeding 
is now most essential, and if persisted in from this time will obviate the 
necessity of cramming for Christmas. It is a most mistaken policy and a 
false economy to merely keep your stock alive ; they should always be in 
good condition. It is more economical to feed poultry that have had 
always a generous diet, than to endeavour to feed and then cram those that 
have been kept at the point of starvation. The food for bringing turkeys 
to the degree of excellence and flavour which we expect at our Christmas 
feast, is or should be composed of sodden oats or barley, oatmeal, barley- 
meal, boiled vegetables — turnip-tops, cabbage, nettles — and a little wheaten 
flour, all well kneaded into a paste, with the addition of rice boiled in 
skimmed milk. This description of food will render them juicy and 
white and fit for the spit in one month from the day of really commencing 
to feed. Very many people cram them, but turkeys are so ravenous that 
cramming is quite unnecessary. They should be fed near home, as tra- 
velling for food when fattening robs them of their flesh. It is of great 
assistance in fattening the turkey, if melted suet or refuse of tallow be 
mixed with their food ; if unable to procure tallow-refuse, linseed-meal 
may be added. A little oilcake sparingly administered we have known 
make fat rapidly. Do not overdo it, as it may induce a flavour in the bird. 
On no account give turkeys pigeons' food, such as peas, vetches, or tares ; 
although a favourite food of the pigeon it is poison to a turkey. 

Having tried to impress upon the turkey-feeder the care he should 
take with the young brood, attention must also be paid to them as they 
grow to maturity. They are liable to the diseases common to poultry 
in general : care is the best doctor, and attending to the simple remedies 
given on the subject of fowls, will in most instances be sufficient. A good 
lock is almost an essential for the turkey-house, as great disappointment 
would be experienced as well as a great loss incurred, if at the last 
moment your turkeys, fit for table, were appropriated by some midnight 
marauder, either biped or quadruped. The fox is very partial to a good 
fat turkey, and although in some places subscriptions are raised by the 
advocates of fox-hunting to defray losses caused by Reynard's attacks on 
the poultry-yards, it is but a poor satisfaction to know that all one's 



Pigeons. 423 

anxiety and trouble in rearing a brood, have been solely for the benefit 
of Mr. Reynard, the fox. 

Turkeys may be made to attain almost any size ; they often reach the 
enormous weight of twenty-five pounds. In some instances (rare ones, 
though) they have weighed ten pounds more. Norfolk turkeys are gene- 
rally in great request, but if you start with a good stock, feed them well, 
and pay attention to them, whatever county or town you live in, you will 
not be ashamed to show your turkeys, either for size or flavour, with the 
best raised in that famous turkey district. The eggs are considered very 
delicate eating, and as the hen sits only once, one sitting occupying thirty 
days, you may have an abundant supply for home consumption and for 
disposal. Turkeys vary in colour : the best and strongest are the green? 
looking black — they approach more closely to the wild bird in colour \ 
some are pink-white, others speckled brown and whiie, but the hardiest 
and the easiest to fatten is the dark description of bird, 

PIGEONS, 

Pigeons are very profitable things to keep, as they breed every month, 
but they must be well attended to and have plenty of food. They, like 
poultry, must be kept very clean. The cot, which should face the south- 
east, should have sand strewed at the bottom about once a fortnight, and 
all dirt removed at the same time. They hatch two birds at each sitting. 
The young are perhaps the most unsightly-looking creatures imaginable. 
They are unable to feed themselves, but the parents are most attentive 
up to a certain period ; as soon as they consider the young should leave 
the cot, every persuasion is used by them to encourage them to do so, 
but if unsuccessful by entreaty or persuasion, they forcibly eject them, 
and make them seek their own food. If pigeons are kept for ornament 
only, select Fantails, Pouters, Tumblers, and the Carrier pigeon ; if for 
profit, the Blue Rock is the best description. The best food for them is 
tares and peas. Plenty of water is a great essential. After dry weather, 
you will see pigeons revelling in a bath, with their wings fully extended, 
so that no part of their body may be deprived of the benefit of a really 
good ablution. Starlings are great enemies to them. Should there be 
any of these birds located near your pigeon-cot, immediately destroy 
them, or say farewell to pigeons. They suck their eggs, occupy their 
nests, and, in fact, entirely root out and destroy the brood of pigeons. 
wSparrows are also very annoying to them, as they will build in the 
pigeon-holes. Do not keep too many cock birds among your pigeons, 
as they are very quarrelsome, and soon thin the dovecot. Pigeons 
are fond of salt, and, as it is very essential to their well-doing, there 
should always be a lump of rock-salt for them to peck at, or a large lump 
of clay placed near the house, thoroughly saturated with brine that may 
no longer be required for domestic purposes. They are subject to many 
diseases common to poultry. The universal remedy for all diseases of 
pigeons may be summed up in two words — bay-salt and cummin-seed, 
mixed. Should they prove scabby, as sometimes happens, on their backs 
and breasts, prepare a paste, made of the following ingredients : — A 
quarter of a pound of bay-salt, the same quantity of common salt, a 



424 Pigeons. 



pound of fennel seeds, a pound of dill seed, the same quantity of cummin- 
seed, and an ounce of assafcetida ; mix with some fine wheaten flour and 
some well-worked clay, beat all well and thoroughly together, put it into 
garden saucers, and bake in the oven ; when cold, put this paste inside 
the dovecot. The pigeons will eat it with avidity, and be rapidly cured. 
It is well to cultivate the breed of Carrier pigeons, as no one can tell how 
soon the necessity may arise for making these useful birds the messengers 
of state secrets ; or they may be used between friends as a safe convey- 
ance of correspondence, escaping thereby the espionage of the post- 
office in some countries. A friend of ours was in the constant habit of 
corresponding by Carrier pigeon. The rate they fly at, and the distance 
they travel, is almost beyond belief. Under their little wings those most 
intelligent pigeons of their breed have not known that the fate of 
dynasties or families has been confided to their care. Some of these 
messengers of peace, of love, or of war, have been known to have carried 
upwards of twelve hundred messages. During the calamitous Franco-Prus- 
sian war, upwards of fifteen thousand messages were carried. Readers 
of the Times may have observed at the commencement of the siege of 
Paris, the " agony," or second column of that paper, with advertisements 
to or from families in Paris to their relatives in England or abroad. In 
less than three weeks the whole front page of that journal, as well as half 
the second page, was filled with that description of advertisement, and 
the greater part of these were conveyed by the trusty Carrier pigeon. 

GUINEA FOWLS. 

Should you have sufficient space, Guinea fowls may be kept, as» 
although the eggs are smaller than the fowl egg, you will have many of 
them, for they commence laying in April or May and continue to do so 
the whole summer. They are of a very rich flavour. Guinea fowls will 
not bear confinement, being of a rambling disposition ; consequently they 
must he carefully watched, or they will lay far away from home, in a 
hedgerow, perhaps, and remain absent until the hen returns for you to 
welcome her with her young brood. 

It is a matter of impossibility to discover their nests ; the only certain 
method is to watch the movements of the cock, for while the hen is 
laying his attention is very great, and where he is you may be certain of 
finding your eggs. As it is uncertain, from their rambling propensities, 
when they will take to sitting (they may sit late in the season, when the 
weather will be too cold for the chicks) it is advisable to secure some 
eggs early in the season and place them under a common hen ; from 
eighteen to twenty eggs may be placed under a good-sized hen. You 
will, if fortunate, secure a brood of guinea chicks about the middle of 
June. They are very delicate, require great warmth, and careful feeding. 
Rice, boiled in milk until perfectly swelled, is an excellent food, as is also 
bread treated in the same manner. Many people treat the chick as they 
do the turkey chick, by giving it a few peppercorns as soon as hatched. 
The hens sit twenty-six days generally, so if you collect your eggs early 
in May, you will have a very early brood, with all the benefit of a long 
summer before them, so that they will be full-grown birds before the 
biting frosts of winter set in. They are inexpensive birds to keep, as, 



Pea Fowl 425 



from rambling about constantly, they pretty well contrive to get their own 
living. On seeing a Guinea fowl walking about, you would imagine it 
was quite a large bird : it has a most deceptive appearance, the feathers 
hanging much more loosely than the common fowl's. When plucked, 
they very seldom exceed the fowl in size. Some old friends of mine were 
frequently in the habit (when late in the season for pheasants) of serving 
young Guinea fowls as a substitute, and a very excellent one they were. 
Having taken the precaution to preserve some feathers from the tail of 
the cock pheasant, the Guinea hen, with its borrowed plumes, often did 
excellent duty for its more gaudily-plumed substitute. You can never 
induce them to roost in the fowl-house ; as soon as dusk commences, you 
hear them calling to each other in that peculiar note, harsh, grating, like 
a wheel grinding, which is one reason some people assign for not keeping 
them. They generally roost in branches of trees, and, like boys playing 
" follow the leader ," as soon as one mounts, the others follow in succession. 
There is little, if any, difference observable between the cock and hen 
bird ; on a close inspection, you may see the helmet-shaped crest, with 
which their head is crowned, larger in the cock than in the hen, and her 
wattles are also different in colour and smaller, the cock's being blue and 
large, those of the hen red and small. 

THE PEA FOWL, 

Though last in our list of poultry, is by no means the least. It is not 
in every establishment that this bird can be kept, as, being of a very 
rambling disposition, it requires space. It loves to roam in shrubberies 
and extensive pleasure grounds, and to such places it is a most appro- 
priate ornament. Who can fail to be struck with admiration at the sur- 
prising beauty of the plumage of the peacock, strutting along in majestic 
grandeur, the tail as it is generally, but erroneously, called, spread ? Those 
splendidly-marked feathers we see expanded are not the tail proper, but 
the feathers that cover the tail ; it is nearly, or completely, covered by 
them. The tail proper consists of abcat eighteen feathers, of a brown, 
rusty hue, which serve as a support for the beautifully-marked feathers 
which we generally call the tail. 

The hen is not so splendid as the cock, but has an aigrette on its head 
the same as the cock. Peacocks are very shy birds. The hen generally 
selects some very sheltered retired spot for her nest. This is not so much to 
protect her eggs from human enemies as it is to hide them from the pea- 
cock, who will destroy every egg that he might see. The same also would 
be the fate of the pea chicks. He would kill every one he might meet by 
pecking them on the crown of the head before the protecting feathers 
sprout. They will not leave the nest for some days after they are hatched ; 
when they do, on no account attempt to chase or catch them, as the hen 
will lead them away through dangerous places, and, in her hurry to pro- 
tect them, trample upon and kill them. 

The peahen sits from six-and-twenty to thirty days. The eggs are greyish- 
white, and she seldom sitsupon more than five eggs. The chicks shouldbe fed 
the same as turkey's chicks ; and when full-grown, corn of different kinds, 
insects, small reptiles, and fruits, are their general and favourite food. As 
a dish for the table, the roast peacock must be seen and tasted by those

who would enjoy a repast worthy of ancient Rome and of our more 
modern times. 

The peacock is a na- 
tive of India, Thibet, 
and the islands of the 
Indian Seas, This bird 
is said to have been in- 
troduced into Europe 
by Alexander the Great. 
The date of its introduc- 
tion into this country 
is unknown. Peacocks 
formed a favourite dish 
at the tables of the an- 
cient Romans and at 
the feasts of the Middle 
Ages. 

A vow taken in the 
presence of the pea- 
cock was considered 
especially sacred, pro- 
bably from its social 
and public nature.

ESGS. 

We will close our few remarks relative to the poultry yard with 
a few words of advice with regard to eggs. When they are plentiful, 
about July, they should begin to be saved for winter consumption. There 
are two or three ways of preserving them, all equally simple. Some dip 
them in boiling water for a second and instantly remove them ; others 
oil each shell. Either of those methods will prevent the air en- 
tering the shell — in fact it becomes hermetically sealed, as it were. 
Others keep them on shelves with holes in them to receive each egg ; 
these should be turned every day, which is a very tedious process. 
Others place them in a tub or stone jar closely packed, and pour lime- 
water, moderately strong, over them until they are all covered. Great care 
must be taken that the lime-water be not too strong, as in that case the 
shells will be completely destroyed, and your eggs will be one incongruous

mass. Should you at any time desire to make a present of a sitting of 
eggs of a choice breed of fowl, it is satisfactory to know that your friend 
will receive them in safety if properly packed. They may either be packed 
in a hamper or a box ; the former is the best. Put at the bottom of it a 
good layer of hay or grass ; wrap each egg separately in the same, and 
place over all a good covering of wool. Pack them carefully, and press 
well round the spaces at the sides some of the same description of pack- 
ing, so that there may be no shaking of the eggs ; should there be, disap- 
pointment will most inevitably follow, as. they will be addled to a cer- 
tainty,

depend entirely on the hap-hazard chance of wet or dry hatching seasons, 
so, to insure a plentiful supply of game, many hundred eggs are placed 
under common fowls and reared and fed as poultry until they are large 
enough to turn out into the woods, when they are dignified with the name 
of game. 

The following directions for rearing them under hens have been, we 
know, adopted with success : — A sufficient number of eggs being provided, 
put them under a hen that has kept her nest for three or four days ; and 
if two or three hens happen to sit on the same day, an opportunity will be 
afforded of shifting the good eggs. At the end of ten or twelve days, 
examine, and throw away those that are bad, and set the same hen or 
hens again. The hens having set their full time, such of the young 
pheasants as are already hatched must be put into a basket, with a piece 
of flannel, till the hen has done hatching, then place the whole brood under 
a frame, with a net over it, and a covered place for the hen, so as to confine 
her ; but leave the young pheasants at liberty to go or return to her at 
pleasure. Their food must consist of boiled eggs cut small, boiled milk 
and bread, alum curd, and ants' eggs, a little of each and often. Rice may 
also be given, softened by boiling ; and, instead of ants' eggs, which in 
some places are not easily procured, or in addition to them, maggots from 
decayed flesh may be used. Artificial ants' eggs may be easily made, 
composed of flour beaten up with an egg and the shell together, and the 
pellets rubbed between the fingers to a proper size. 

After two or three days, the pheasants will know the call of their foster- 
mother, and may then be allowed to run upon a grass-plot, or the edge of a 
corn-field is very desirable, as they like the tall stems, and soon learn to pick 
up the green grains. Take care to shift them with the sun, and guard 
them from cold winds. They ought not to be let out in the morning before 
the sun is up, and they must be shut in with the hen in good time in the 
evening. When they are old enough those that are to be turned out wild 
ought to be taught to perch. This is done by tying a string to a hen's 
leg, and obliging her to sit in a tree all night. She should be placed there 
before sunset, and if she falls down she must be perseveringly replaced, 
till she becomes contented with her position. Next the young birds will 
follow her example and perch with her, and in a few days they will be able 
to take care of themselves. 

If regularly fed, they will remain near any particular spot, and fre- 
quent a lawn or pleasure ground as familiarly and almost as fearlessly as 
common poultry. 

Instances have been known of the pheasant breeding with the common 
fowl. Other crosses also have occurred — viz., with the pheasant and 
turkey, as also with the Guinea fowl. We have mention also of a cross 
between the pheasant and grey hen, the female of the blackcock. 

Pheasants are bred in vast numbers now in this country, and at a 
great expense to those that preserve them. It is generally supposed that 
by the time the pheasants are fit to shoot, each bird has cost in its rearing 
from 2s. 6d. to 3^. 

PHEASANTS FOR AVIARIES. 

The Chinese species of pheasants have a much more splendid plumage 
than the British-bred pheasant. Their plumage is truly magnificent, and

should find a place in every aviary. The Golden pheasant is one blaze 
of splendour, reminding one almost of the description of birds in some fairy 
tale. In contrast to the gorgeous plumage of the Golden, we have the de- 
licately-tinted Silver pheasant, also from the same country ; but they are 
getting common in this country now — in fact, no aviary is considered 
complete without them ; and it is generally supposed that if they were 
turned out, as the other common pheasant is, they would thrive equally 
welL 

There is one description of pheasant which has splendid plumage, 
generally known as Reeves' pheasant. The feathers in the tail of the male 
bird are very nearly six feet long. 

The Japanese pheasants are also remarkable for their extraordinarily 
beautiful plumage. They are in their manners and habits exactly the 
same as our own common pheasant. 

The Himalaya mountains in Hindostan have a remarkably extraor- 
dinary description of pheasant called the Horned pheasant. The plume 
of this bird is also extremely beautiful. 

The Argus pheasant of Sumatra and the adjacent islands should also 
be found in our aviaries. The wings of this bird are covered with beau- 
tiful spots, which the male bird is proud of showing when strutting 
in the society of the female birds. It is also remarkable for the extraor- 
dinary development of the secondary quill feathers of the wings, which, 
although an impediment in flying, are of very great assistance when run- 
ning, which it does very swiftly. The tail of this bird is also beautifully 
spotted ; and when disporting with the female birds, it is raised aloft and 
spread to show its beauty. The generality of pheasants feed on grain of 
various descriptions ; but there is one found in Nepaul, called the Im- 
peyan pheasant, which lives principally on bulbous roots, and its bill is of 
the shape of a scoop, which enables it to raise them with ease. The 
plumage of the male bird is perfectly resplendent. It is almost impossible 
to describe the beauty of the several tints — changing and changing again 
and again with the dazzling hues of green, steel-blue, and golden bronze. 
At a first glance one would imagine the bird clothed in scale armour. It 
has a crested head, of a naked shaft of feathers. The back of this splendid 
bird is of the purest white. The female varies in its plumage from the 
male bird, being altogether of a sombre hue, bearing no resemblance what- 
ever to the transcendent beauty of the cock. The young birds are plumed 
much in the same manner as the female.

DOMESTIC PETS. 



This is a very comprehensive title, and might fairly be supposed to 
comprise ponies, donkeys, dogs, cats, rabbits, poultry, and pigeons ; 
but this article will be confined to animals kept in the house, and will 
especially relate to those which may be legitimately called Pets, the care 
of them devolving entirely upon their owners. Out-of-door pets must 
necessarily be left in a great measure to the care of servants, and cannot 
be so essentially home friends. 

Squirrels, dormice, and white mice are sometimes kept in captivity 
by those whose lives are chiefly spent in towns, and who have no know- 
ledge of the wild frolicsome creatures in their native haunts ; but they 
appear to lead very unnatural lives in confinement, and are not very 
desirable pets for the house : it is difficult to keep their cages quite sweet 
and clean. All may be domesticated, however, and are, we believe, capable 
of attachment to their owners. We have never kept any ourselves ; but our 
brothers had dormice from time to time, and several small families were 
born and brought up under their care, but most of them came to an 
untimely end. 

The squirrel seems so delightfully free and happy, playing about on 
the tops of the tallest trees in the woods, launching himself boldly into 
the air, and taking tremendous leaps from branch to branch, that after 
seeing the pretty little creature at his ease, one does not feel inclined to 
deprive him of the liberty he seems so thoroughly to enjoy ; but if he is 
captured, his life ought to be made as happy as possible, and he should 
be allowed as much exercise as he can have in the house. His casre

should be at least 3 or 4 feet long and 3 or 4 feet high, and instead 
of the revolving cylinder, which is very injurious to the little prisoner, he

should have a good-sized branch of a tree, to form perches for him, and 
be able to frisk about at pleasure in his little parlour. A little sleeping- 
box must be attached to this, with a door at the back, and the board 
forming the floor should be drawn out like that of a bird-cage. Every 
part of the cage must be kept as clean as possible, and the moss and 
cotton wool, which must be put into the squirrel's bedroom, must be 
changed nearly every day. The active little creature does not often live 
long in confinement ; but if taken young, and very carefully managed, it 
may become a very tame and a very engaging pet, and may sometimes 
be trusted to frolic about out of doors when tame enough to return at his 
owner's call. His cage should, however, be lined with tin ; for he is 
apt to gnaw the wood with his sharp little teeth when impatient of 
confinement. He should be fed on nuts, almonds, filberts, beech masts, 
walnuts, acorns, wheat in the ear, and fir cones ; and he is fond of milk, 
cold tea, and bread-and-milk. A little bit of boiled potato, and even a 
tiny morsel of cooked meat, may be given as a treat, and a stale crust of 
bread to gnaw. All creatures require variety in their food, and in his 
wild state the squirrel gets animal food by robbing birds' nests of their 
eggs occasionally. He lays up a store of food for the winter in various 
holes and crevices, and is much too acute ever to put by a nut in which 
a maggot has been, or to miss the place where his treasure is concealed, 
even when several inches depth of snow covers the ground. The female is 
a very affectionate mother, and will remain with her young in the nest 
even while the tree in which it is, is cut down, or will carry them, one 
after another, in her mouth, to a place of safety. She generally builds 
on the topmost branches of the fir tree, and the nest is made of dry 
grass and sticks, very slightly yet firmly put together, and lined with fur, 
which she scratches off her body before the young ones are born. This 
is generally in the summer, and the young squirrels remain with their 
parents till the following spring, when they are able to manage for them- 
selves. They have a substantial winter's nest, to which they appear to 
add every year fresh layers of hay and moss, to make their habitation 
more and more warm and comfortable. I have been told that the best 
time to buy a squirrel is at the end of September, when it is fat and 
vigorous and its fur is in good condition ; but it is never safe to purchase 
those which are sold in the street as " wonderfully tame," and which will 
allow themselves to be handled by a stranger, and pulled about, without 
showing any disposition to bite. The probability is that the poor little 
creatures have been stupefied by some drug, and that they will either 
recover their natural ferocity in a few hours, or die — poisoned by the 
narcotic which has been given them. 

The dormouse is very like the squirrel in many of its habits : it lives 
upon much the same food, and is a hybernating animal too, laying up a 
store of eatables for the winter, and passing the greater part of the cold 
months in sleep. In a cage it is not seen to advantage : throughout the 
day it is generally rolled up into a little soft ball of fur, fast asleep, and its 
architectural talents are quite thrown away. It is in its wild state a very- 
clever nest-builder, and Mr. Wood gives a most fascinating description of a 
dormouse's nest, which he found in a hedge 4 feet from the ground, in the 
forking of a hazel branch, the smaller twigs of which formed a palisade 
round it. The nest itself was 6 inches long and 3 wide, and constructed of 



43 2 The Dormouse. 



grass blades and leaves of trees. The blades of the sword-grass were chiefly 
used, and these were twisted round and between the twigs so as to form a 
hollow oval nest. Finer sorts of grass and the slender stems (not bigger 
than thread) of delicate climbing weeds, interwoven with the leaves of hazel 
and maple trees, were used for the bottom of the nest ; the entrance to 
which was most ingeniously concealed by long blades of grass placed across 
it in such a manner as to spring back to their places, after havingbeen pushed 
aside to admit the dormouse into the nest. This was never used as a 




Dormouse. 

storehouse ; the little creature had its winter provisions carefully hidden 
under a thick branch in the neighbourhood of the nest. While hyber- 
nating, the dormouse does not seem to require food : but it wakes up 
occasionally during the winter, perhaps when a warm sunny day calls it 
into life for the time, and then it takes food before it rolls itself up and 
sleeps again. It requires a good deal of warmth, and must have soft 
hay, moss, and wool given it to form its bed, and it does its best with 
these, but cannot construct anything very beautiful out of them. 

If we had a tame dormouse, we think we should try to provide it with 
materials which it might be induced to use for the construction of a nest 
like that described by Mr. Wood. The dormice our brothers had were 
kept in a cage made for dormice, wired at one end, with a little compart- 
ment at the other boarded in, the door of which was pulled up and 
pushed down at pleasure, so that the little creatures could be shut 
into their bedroom when the outer room was cleaned out. Even with 
this precaution they were continually getting out of the cage, they were 
such nimble little animals, and the whole house was often searched in 
vain for the truants. At last, perhaps, they would be found in the .fold of 
a curtain or underneath the cushion of a sofa. Sometimes a worse fate 
befell them, and they would creep under the cushion of an arm-chair, 
and get crushed to death, or be trodden under loot, or be squeezed under 
a door in trying to escape. They sleep during the day and come out in 
the evening, so that they must be provided with food as soon as it grows 
dusk ; and if they have a large cage with sticks placed across it, they will 
gambol about very merrily in the open part of it as soon as night

approaches. Their food should be varied as much as possible : they will 
eat nuts and almonds, peas and beans, canary seed, and various other 
grains ; and they are very fond of the milky juice of a dandelion or sow- 
thistle. We used always to put a little tin pan of milk into the cage every 
night, and they would often drink it all, especially when they had young 
ones. It is said that rabbits will be hindered from devouring their young 
by providing them with water, and that they would not eat them unless 
maddened by thirst or suffering from extreme hunger. Some dormice 
have the same propensity to cannibalism ; and if this theory about the 
rabbits be correct, it may apply also to the mother dormouse which 
devours her young. We thought she did so when alarmed for their 
safety, not being able to conceal them elsewhere ; but it would be well to 
provide her with a constant supply of water or milk when nursing. The 
milk is useful too in furnishing the dormouse with animal food; out ol 
doors it eats insects. There are generally four or five young ones in a 
litter, born blind, but able to see in a few days, and they are soon capable 
of taking care of themselves. The cage must, of course, be kept perfectly 
clean, and the floor of the open part should be sanded like a bird-cage. 

White, Grey-and-White, and Brown and White mice are sometimes 
kept in cages like those of the dormouse, and they must be treated in 
the same manner. The common Brown mouse is said to be a more 
tractable and intelligent pet, and to be easily tamed by patient kindness. 
I never heard a mouse sing, but several instances are recorded of mice 
who have learned to imitate the chirp and even the song of a canary 
kept in the room in which they were ; so that it might be worth while to

try to give such pets the benefit of a musical education for the chance of 
their acquiring so curious an accomplishment. The little Harvest mouse, 
the tiniest of British quadrupeds, has sometimes been kept in a cage, and 
will grow tame enough to take its favourite food, flies and other insects, 
from the hand. It is a most beautiful little creature, very active and agile, 
climbing about by means of its long tail and flexible toes, and leaping like 
a little Jerboa. It should have grains of wheat and maize, and canary

seed, and plenty of water always in the cage ; and wool or flannel and 
grass for its nest, which in its wild state is the most beautiful and elabo- 
rate construction of leaves and grass woven together into a round ball 
and suspended from strong grass-stems, wheat-stalks, or thistle-heads. 
In the winter it takes refuge in corn ricks, or burrows deeply in the earth, 
and makes a warm bed of grass. Even in confinement the harvest 
mouse will show its instinctive propensity to store up food for the winter, 
and if a number of grains of wheat or seed are given to it, will carry them 
off and hide them in its nest. 

None of these little creatures, however pretty and intelligent they may 
be, seem to me to be such desirable pets to be kept in the house as Birds, 
to which the remainder of this article will be devoted. We can make them 
so happy, and they can tell us when anything is amiss with them so plainly 
—so thoroughly enjoying our petting, and becoming so attached to us — 
that no trouble is thrown away upon our feathered pets. 

On the whole, I think canaries flourish best in imprisonment. All the 
English finches do well in aviaries or cages ; but one does not like to see 
them imprisoned while their brothers and sisters are flying about at large 
close by — one thinks they must envy them their liberty, and long to join 
them ; while canaries would suffer extremely exposed to the cold of 
winter, if, indeed, they survived it. As regards other birds — robins, 
wrens, titmice, sparrows, &c. — it is much pleasanter to have them visit- 
ing us from the garden than to keep them shut up all the year round ; and 
larks and nightingales are so completely out of their natural element in 
cages that one cannot feel happy in keeping them. Any one who will 
take the trouble to feed the birds that congregate round the house in 
winter may soon have a family of pensioners. 

The robins will become our very familiar friends — hopping about at 
their ease on the breakfast-table, examining every article in the room with 
the utmost self-possession ; will visit us regularly through the cold months, 
and, if they leave us in spring, will bring their young ones to make our 
acquaintance when they leave their nests. Crumbs of bread, potatoes, 
and scraps of fat will make a feast for the poor little hungry birds, driven 
by frost and snow to our doors ; and the saucy tomtits and sparrows 
will afford us much amusement in return for our hospitality. 

We may get much insight into the special characteristics of the birds 
by watching them when they are at their ease, and a hard winter will some- 
times make them so tame, and so accustom them to our care, that they 
will hover about us out of doors, and peck at the windows for admittance 
at their usual feeding hours. 

Although I do not advocate keeping English birds in confinement as 
a rule, it will sometimes happen that nestlings will be thrown upon our 
compassion, which have either fallen out of their nest, lost their parents, 
or have been taken captive by village boys, and are likely to come to a 
miserable end if not taken care of. Under these circumstances it is as 
well to know how to bring them up by hand. I once had several nests to 
take care of, and all the young birds were reared and sent out into the 
world when able to take care of themselves ; all but two bullfinches, 
which were given to a neighbour, who fed them upon hemp-seed — the con- 
sequence of which was that nearly all their feathers fell off, and they were 
the most miserable little objects that can be conceived, and their little red- 



The Linnet. — The Greenfinch. — The Bullfinch. 435 



hot bodies were quite uncomfortable to touch. A course of warm baths 
and plenty of cooling green food, however, restored them to health and 
beauty, and they were returned to their owner with a warning against 
hemp-seed. It is said that a bullfinch fed entirely upon this heating seed 
will become blind. 

Nestlings should be fed upon bread soaked in water, squeezed nearly dry, 
and chopped up finely with rape-seed which has been scalded by pouring 
boiling water upon it, and leaving it till quite cold. Of course this food 
must be made fresh every day ; if it grew sour it would kill the birds at 
once. About four quills full of it is enough for a meal for one young bird ; 
but they generally clamour for food till they have enough, and then settle 
down to sleep again. They must be fed as soon as possible in the morn- 
ing after sunrise, and will require food at intervals of from one hour and 
three-quarters to two hours throughout the day, the last meal being given 
about sunset, when they must be covered up for the night. The best plan 
is to keep the nest in a shallow box, over which a board can be laid to 
darken it, otherwise the birds will be asking for food every quarter of an 
hour. As soon as they hear a step in the room they begin to chirp ; and 
when the box is uncovered they will stretch out their necks, and as they 
grow older jump out of the nest, and fly upon the hand or shoulder in their 
impatience for food. In time they will learn to feed themselves with the 
soft food, and by degrees to pick up and shell the seed put into their cage ; 
for of course they must be put into a cage as soon as they are fledged suffi- 
ciently to enable them to fly. It is best to crush the hemp-seed for them 
at first, but they soon learn to shell the canary and rape-seed. 

The linnets and greenfinches I brought up by hand were very tame, 
and although I left seed and water always within their reach, I accustomed 
them to be fed by me, and kept any food of which they were particularly 
fond — hemp-seed, plantain, or chickweed, for instance, which all birds 
love — to be given them as dainties ; so they always expected something 
nice from me, and would fly out of their cages and all round the room in 
their joy as soon as I opened the doors, returning to perch on my hand, 
shoulder, or head when they wanted their food. The greenfinches were 
very bold birds, and as familiar as possible with me. They were great 
eaters, and very eager for their favourite food, so they alway welcomed me 
very heartily ; but I did not prize their affection so much as I did that of 
the linnets, which were naturally more shy and retiring, and required 
more courting and petting. They are very nice pets, and become very 
much attached to their owner, and their song is very sweet ; but if kept 
in confinement they never acquire the red poll and breast which ought to 
distinguish the male bird in full plumage. They are fond of flax or lin- 
seed, but they must not have much of it, or they will grow very fat. Canary 
and rape-seed should be the principal food both of linnets and green- 
finches. As soon as my four green nestlings were full grown I let them 
fly out of the window, but for a long time they used to come back to the 
cage for food,and sometimes would roost there during the night; however, 
at last they found companions of their own kind in the woods and fields, 
who gradually weaned them from us. 

The bullfinch is a very nice pet ; he becomes so attached to his 
owner, and will not bestow his affection indiscriminately, so that he 
repays one for any attention given him. He is subject to fits of jealousy,

however ; and I have known birds who would take a violent dislike to 
any friends of their mistress upon whom they thought some of the 
affection due to themselves was bestowed. Some have died of grief 
when separated from those who petted and fed them, and who had won 
their faithful little hearts completely. They are happy in confinement, if 
not made ill by improper food, as they are not very active birds. They 
should have no sweets or injurious delicacies, but be fed upon rape and 
canary-seed, with an occasional treat of hemp-seed, water-cress, lettuce, 
and chickweed and groundsel. If they mope and ruffle their plumage, 
they should be fed only upon scalded rape-seed for a few days. When 
moulting, they require a little hard egg and breadcrumbs, and a rusty 
nail or a clove in their drinking-water. They like a little bit of apple 
and a few berries occasionally. In gardens they are supposed to do a 
great deal of mischief by eating the young buds and fruit ; but it is 
doubtful whether the good they do by eating the insects upon them is 
not more than the destruction they are accused of. Their natural song is 
not musical, but they may be taught to whistle or "pipe" airs very 




Bullfinch. 

accurately. The Germans take great pains in the teaching of their 
young bullfinches. They divide them into classes of five or six pupils, 
and they are kept much in the dark, and the tunes they are to learn are 
repeated over and over again to them while they are fed. By degrees 
light is admitted, and after a time the birds are taken out of the class, 
one by one, and given into the charge of a boy, whose duty it is to 
repeat the tunes on a bird-organ from morning to night, till the bird 
acquires them perfectly, when a large price will be paid for him. Some 
bird teachers keep their pupils fasting while they learn their lessons, and 
only feed them as a reward ; but I believe the best and most humane 
plan is to repeat the airs to them while they are digesting their food ; and 
if they are taught by good whistling instead of by a bird-organ, they 
generally pipe in a pleasanter and more flute-like manner. Bullfinches 
that CA.n pipe three or four distinct airs correctly are highly prized, and 4/. 
or 5/., or even more, will be paid for them. It is, however, as well to 
suggest that there may be disappointment in store for their purchasers, 
for the birds are often apt to forget their accomplishments while they are

moulting, and they ought to have the airs frequently repeated to them 
during this time of silence, and when they are beginning to use their 
voices again. 

The bullfinch can be taught to perform many amusing tricks, such as 
drawing up water in a bucket from a little well underneath his cage, and 
the more difficult feat of pumping it up to fill his bath ; but although in- 
telligent and docile enough to learn these, such accomplishments do not 
appear to suit him so well as the active, restless little goldfinch, who is 
scarcely still a minute in the day, and seems to want something to do to 
fill up his time in confinement. 

The goldfinch is an universal favourite, both from its beauty and 
sprightliness : it is very restless in a cage, and therefore I do not think it 
appears as contented as some less active birds ; but it will live many 
years in confinement, and in an aviary is as happy as possible. It ought 
not to have a bell-shaped cage, as it is apt to grow giddy, twirling its beak 
along the wires. It is very easily tamed, and is capable of great attach- 
ment to its owner, and may generally be safely allowed a- flight round the 
room while its cage is being cleaned. I had one which would fly across 
the room to me as soon as its cage door was opened, and perch on my 
shoulder for its favourite food of hemp-seed. It is rather fond of eating, 
I think, and takes so much exercise that I suppose it requires plenty of 
food. It will not sing without a few hemp-seeds in the day, but it must 
not be fed solely upon this heating seed. Canary, rape, and poppy-seed 
should be the ordinary food of goldfinches. Lettuce, groundsel, chick- 
weed, and water-cress they should have frequently, and plantain in the 
winter ; in the wild state they feed much on thistle-seed, and they should 
often have a thistle-head given to them, to pick the seeds out of it for 
themselves. They ought not to have sugar or sweet cakes, but they exceed- 
ingly enjoy a treat of biscuit, and Reading cracknels are very wholesome 
for them, and thoroughly appreciated by goldfinches, bullfinches, and 
canaries. 

The goldfinch is a very tractable bird, and there are many accomplish- 
ments which he will learn, and seems to exhibit with pleasure. He may

be taught to fire off a small cannon, to feign death, and stand unmoved 
while fireworks are let off close to him, to mount a ladder, &c. ; but I 



433 



The Goldfinch. 



fear when these tricks are made use of by his master to exhibit in public 
for pay, he is often treated with cruelty to make him a proficient in them. 
Many very harmless accomplishments he will learn, however, merely by 
patience and kindness on the part of his teacher — to open a box for his 
seed, to ring a bell when he wants food, to drag a little waggon up an 




inclined plane into his cage, and to draw up water from a little well under- 
neath it. All these are easily taught, and the bird really seems to find 
pleasure in such little tasks. One of my birds who lived in a cage so 
constructed as to have the seed always in a box of which he had to lift 
up the lid, and the water in a well to be drawn up in a bucket, was quite 
unhappy when his home was undergoing repair, and he had to live for a 
time in an ordinary cage, and sang his merriest song when he had to go 
to work with his little chain and pail again. I taught him to lift the lid 
of the box by having it open for one day, and then gradually lowering it 
by means of a piece of silk put round it, fastened at the back of the cage, 
till it was quite shut. He very soon found out that he must lift it up with 
his beak in order to reach the seed ; and at last he became so crafty about 
it, that he would take out two or three seeds at once, and put a reserve 
by his side between the wires while he ate one. The cage was made with 
a wooden back, and the box was let into this above the door, and the lid 
fastened to the inside with two little hinges (care should be taken that the 
lid is not too heavy for the bird to lift easily, and that it should fall at 
once when not held up) ; a little bow window was constructed in the 
front of the cage, in the floor of which was a little hole with a wire across 
it, to which was attached a light silver chain fastened to a silver bucket 
about the size of a thimble. A small coloured glass tumbler was fixed 
below the bow window, by means of four strong wires and a ring. This 
was filled with water and the bucket dropped into the well, and the bird 
hauled up the chain with his beak, holding each fresh haul with his feet 
till the bucket came to the hole, and he could drink out of it. I taught 
him this accomplishment by filling the bucket with water, and putting it 
on the floor of the bow window to accustom him to look for water there 



The Siskin. 439 



then I let it down by means of the chain pushed through two of the side 
wires by degrees, lowering it a little more every day. At first the bird 
pulled up the short bit of chain with his beak, and let it go before he 
could drink out of the bucket, but he gradually found out that he must hold 
the chain when he had drawn it up, and when he had once succeeded in 
doing this his education was finished ; he never forgot the art, and often 
showed his delight in his task by singing when he had drawn up the bucket 
while his chain was under his feet, before he quenched his thirst. Of course 
it is necessary to see that the machinery of the bucket, chain, and well is 
always in order ; any hitch preventing the bucket from falling into the 
well and getting re-filled with water would cause the poor little bird to 
die of thirst. The bullfinch and siskin will readily learn this accom- 
plishment, and I had a mule bird (whose parents were a goldfinch and 
canary) who learned it very quickly ; but I never succeeded in teaching a 
canary to put his foot on the chain, though he would pull it up with his 
beak readily enough — of course, always to be disappointed by the falling 
down of the bucket. A goldfinch will learn to pull a little waggon up an 
inclined plane in the same way, and to take his seed out of it, the chain 
attached to the waggon having to be hauled in and held in the same 
manner. The w r ay to teach him to ring for his food, is to suspend a 
little bell in a corner of his cage, and when he has been an hour or two 
without food, to ring it by means of a string attached to it, and imme- 
diately to place some of his favourite seed in the glass. In a few days 
he will discover that whenever the bell rings he gets a meal, and will 
seize the string, and peal away merrily whenever he is hungry. 

The goldfinch is rather subject to epileptic fits, and whenever he is 
seized with one, he should be plunged head downwards into cold water, 
and one or two dips will restore him at once. He is a large eater, and in 
all probability has indulged his appetite too much, so that he must be 
kept upon a low diet of lettuce seed and thistles, and have no hemp-seed 
for a few days after he has had one of these fits. 

He is fond of bathing, and should have a bath every day. The gold- 
finch will sometimes mate with the canary, and the mules are very pretty. 
He must, however, be taken away from his wife as soon as she begins to 
lay, as he has a mischievous propensity for breaking the eggs. After the 
young birds are hatched he may be put back into the cage, and will help 
in feeding them. I have never had a siskin, but it is a very favourite 
bird among bird-fanciers, especially in Germany, where it is ranked as 
one of the best of cage birds. It is smaller than the canary, and its song 
is not so loud — a low sweet warble, which suits some people better than 
a more beautiful song. It is a very sociable bird and very easily tamed, 
and is very amusing to watch in a cage, on account of its whimsical pos- 
tures and climbing propensities. It seems to delight in doing things 
which it would be next to impossible for ordinary birds to accomplish : it 
will drink in a perpendicular position, hanging by its legs, with its head 
downwards, and sleep clinging to the wires instead of roosting on a perch, 
and will run along the top of its cage like a fly upon the ceiling of a room. 
It seems to use its feet very much like parrots, and to throw somersaults 
like a mountebank for amusement. Doubtless it would soon learn all the 
feats which have been spoken of as accomplished by the goldfinch, to 
perfection. The siskin is said to be very fond of eating, and to eat

much more than most birds of its own size. It should be fed on canary, 
rape, and poppy-seed, with occasional treats of hemp-seed and aimonds, 
of which it is very fond, and must have plenty of water both for drinking

and bathing. Very handsome mules are obtained by mating the siskin 
with the canary. 

The chaffinch is not valued so much in England as in Germany, where 
bird-fanciers prize it exceedingly for its song. Indeed, the enthusiasm 
about it is so great that in some of the villages the inhabitants appear to 
have quite a passion for the chaffinch's song. At Buhl, in Thuringia, the 
cotters will go ninety miles to catch one who is supposed to sing well, and

a common workman will give as much as i6j-. for one, and live on bread 
and water to get the money ; indeed, there is a proverb amongst them, "A 
chaffinch is worth a cow." Bechstein gives no less than eight varieties of 
songs most admired in his country, and says that no amateur can hear the

441 



double trill of the Hartz without being in an ecstasy. The chaffinch's song 
seems to vary in different countries and in different provinces. The biro? 
catchers who frequent Epping Forest, say that the birds there sing a dif- 
ferent song from those on the other side of the river ; and they have 
singing matches amongst their birds, the prize being given to the owner 
of the bird who delivers the greatest number of perfect notes within a 
certain time. A perfect note in their estimation is represented by toll-loll- 
loll-chick-zvee-do, and if the bird slurs over his notes, and stops at chick 
or wee, the note is not to be counted. 

The chaffinch is easily tamed, and lives happily with other English 
finches and canaries ; feeding on the same food recommended for the 
goldfinch. Too much hemp would produce blindness or some other dis- 
ease. A bell-shaped cage is objectionable for the chaffinch, who has the 
same disposition as the goldfinch to giddiness. In its wild state it builds 
the most beautiful nest of lichen, lined with feathers ; in confinement, I 
am afraid, its architectural talents would fall into abeyance. 

If my readers desire to have a nursery of young birds, they will find 
canaries the best in every respect to rear. There is no doubt about their 
happiness in a cage, if proper attention be paid to them ; and I would 
fain believe that no one who reads these pages would willingly cause them 
suffering from want of care, or would attempt to keep pets upon whom 

they are not ready to bestow all the 
time and trouble necessary to keep 
them in health and comfort. People 
are not worthy of their birds if 
they neglect them, and leave them 
to the care of servants, to whom 
they are either troublesome or indif- 
ferent. And their attention will be 
received with such expressive grati- 
tude and delight— their feathered pets 
will welcome them so gladly, and 
show so plainly how much their hap- 
piness depends upon their care — that 
they will be sufficiently rewarded for 
its bestowal. They should become in- 
timately acquainted with their birds' 
dispositions, too, and learn their lan- 
guage thoroughly, and they will find 
a fund of amusement in their society. 
This is more easily accomplished 
when one or two pet birds are kept in 
a cage alone, than when there are 
a number of canaries together in a 
very large cage or aviary, but I always 
ike best to see them under such circumstances — they seem so thoroughly 
happy when they have room for flying and frolicking about ; some birds, 
too, will sing best when they are excited by emulation with others, but 
occasionally a good songster is sulky when in company, and prefers being 
alone. One of my birds who had been accustomed to a small single 
cage, never seemed at ease when in a large one, and resented being jostled

44-2 The Canary. 

by others. He was an old bird, too, and did not like his saucy young 
companions, and showed his displeasure by total silence whenever he was 
placed with them ; so I had to restore him to solitary grandeur. 

All through the autumn and winter months, about twenty or thirty 
birds will live very happily together, in a cage from 3 to 4 feet long, and 2 
feet high and wide. This should be made of tin wire, as brass is apt to 
corrode, and communicate its poisoned green rust to the birds, when they 
rub their beaks against it ; the iron rust is very good for them. The 
wood may be either mahogany or varnished deal. The arrangements for 
seed and water should be carefully attended to. If the former is put 
into the cage, the bird-hoppers are best to use, because the seed is kept 
clean, and only falls down as the birds peck and scatter away the husks 
beneath. A good plan is to have the seed and water in long covered 
boxes outside the cage, with china or glass trays to take in and out of 
them. These can be kept perfectly sweet and clean, and the birds 
cannot make the seed or water dirty. Objections are made to the old- 
fashioned bird-glasses, because they are sometimes carelessly put into the 
wires which hold them, so that they slip aside, and the poor little birds 
cannot get at the water ; but no provision for their comfort can succeed 
if carelessness be allowed at all. I do not advocate their use, however, 
for if they are very full, the seed or water often gets spilt into the cage, and 
if not, the birds have to stretch their little necks painfully to reach their 
food. Sometimes, too, a young bird will contrive in some mysterious 
fashion to get into the glass, and having got in, cannot extricate itself. 
One of mine was nearly suffocated by getting into a seed-glass, and it 
was a long time before I could pull it out again. I had to pour all the 
seed out first, and at last I contrived to rescue it ; but another bird, of 
which I heard at the time, got into the water-glass, and was drowned 
before its danger was discovered. Nothing looks prettier at first than a 
fountain in the middle of the cage ; but it becomes so dirty in a few hours 
that it is not well to use it. A bath, wired round like the cage, should be 
made to hang on the doorway, and the birds will go in and out and splash 
about in this, with the greatest delight. It must be taken away when they 
have all had a good washing, in cold weather especially, as some of them 
will go into the bath again and again, and get completely chilled. In 
winter the water must have the chill taken off, and whenever the sun 
shines they may have a bath safely. They must always have sand spread 
on the board at the bottom of the cage ; and the coarse gravelly sand is 
best for them. It is a good plan to have a second board and two sets of 
perches for a large cage ; this gives opportunity for washing and drying 
them thoroughly, and when the board gets wetted by the splashing of the 
birds, it can be dried before it is returned to the cage. Of course the 
perches must be made to take in and out of the cage ; they should be 
round and smooth like a bamboo. A swing suspended from the centre is 
a source of pleasure to the birds, and if the cage has a domed top, looks 
very pretty underneath it. They much enjoy hiving a pot of mignonette 
or of chickweed put in ; and all perch eagerly about it, and soon devour 
every leaf and flower. No plant that would be injurious to them must be 
put either in or close to the cage, for they are sure to eat the leaves, and 
the beauty of the plant is destroyed in a few hours. My cage stands on 
a flower-stand and has flowers all round it, but the plants are kept out of 



The Canary. 443 



the bird's reach. A fir branch put into the cage occasionally gives them a 
good deal of amusement, and seems to do them no harm ; but it is very- 
soon reduced to a bare pole. Plantain is very good winter food for them, 
and they enjoy picking it from the stalk. Their food should have plenty 
of variety, to keep them in health and good humour. They must not 
have sugar or sweet cakes, but plain biscuits — cracknels, for instance, are 
good for them. Their staple food should be canary and bird turnip (the 
small brown summer rape) seed, a small quantity of hemp-seed each day, 
and occasionally, in cold weather, a pinch of maw, or poppy-seed, always 
to be given while the birds are moulting. When they are building they 
must have a mixture of hard-boiled egg and finely-crumbled stale bread, 
with a pinch of the same seed mixed with it every morning. It must 
always be made and given freshly, or it will turn sour and kill the birds. 
This food may be dispensed with while the hen is sitting ; but as soon as 
she is about to hatch, it must be put in the cage for the young to be fed 
upon. 

Canaries ought to have green food three or four times a week, 
chickweed, groundsel, or lettuce. It is better for them to have a little 
constantly than a great quantity now and then, when they are apt to eat 
over-eagerly of it. They should have some whole oatmeal or grits every 
day ; sometimes a little piece of bread soaked in milk, not boiled, unless 
it is given as medicine ; a little lump of basalt to peck at, or a bit of 
apple, or pear, or potato, or rice pudding. All these tit-bits are, of course, 
to be considered as delicacies, to be given by the birds' owner, and they 
will help very much to win their affection. They require warmth and 
nourishing food during moulting : if they seem weak, a rusty nail in the 
water gives them a little tonic, and a small piece of Spanish liquorice is 
good for hoarseness. By way of physic, I think I have rarely found 
any of the many nostrums recommended as specifics of much use, 
excepting boiled milk. If they have been eating too freely of green food, 
a lump of chalk may be useful. Some bird-fanciers give ants' eggs and a 
spider occasionally, and it is likely that this animal food would be good 
for them now and then. Most birds are, to a certain extent, insectivorous 
in their wild state. Variety in their food is necessary for all birds ; and 
if they have this, and the seed is good and sound, and they are not 
exposed to draughts or sudden changes of temperature, they will rarely 
have anything amiss with them which a warm bath will not cure. When- 
ever my birds look moping, or when the hen is " egg-bound," and cannot 
lay her eggs, I give them a bath at 96 , holding the bird in my hand while 
immersing all but the head in the water for three or four minutes, then 
taking it out and drying the feet, I put it in the sunshine, or at a little 
distance from a fire to get dry. Sometimes, if a bird is not fond of 
bathing, the feet will get clogged, especially during nesting, when the 
claws get a bit of hair or cotton twisted around them occasionally, and the 
feet should be cleansed in warm water, and gently freed from their trouble- 
some encumbrance. 

An old bird's claws will sometimes grow too long, so that it cannot 
perch comfortably, and they must be very carefully cut, taking care not to 
draw blood, or to injure the bird in any way. W T henever possible, it is 
best to avoid catching the birds, especially if they are wild and fly about 
in alarm ; but if taught to consider their owner as their friend, they

will generally submit, without much fluttering, to be taken hold of ; and 
illness generally tames them sufficiently to make them quiet when they 
require to be taken out of the cage to be put into a bath. 

Early in spring, when the cock birds begin to fight, the hens should be 
taken away, and kept apart in another cage till the pairs are put together 
in March. Some people allow their birds to choose their own mates ; 
but a great deal of quarrelling takes place before this, and two or three 
gentlemen will sometimes fix their affections on the same lady, and they 
will get injured in the combats that ensue ; besides which, if it be an 
object to secure good coloured birds, it is necessary to put those together 
whose colours contrast well : a mealy cock with a jonque hen, or a green 
bird with a yellow partner. Handsomer birds are obtained by these 
selections than when two birds of the same colour are paired ; and two 
crested birds should never be put together, the young will probably be 
bald-headed. It is best to give an old wife to a young cock, and vice 
versa ; and the birds of a family should never be mated together : the 
progeny will infallibly be weak and unhealthy if this is permitted. Two 
of my birds were accidentally paired, a brother and sister, and the result 
was that one of their children was blind, and another deformed. For 
these reasons it is best not to leave the birds to choose for themselves, but 
to separate them before any attachment springs up among them. Cages 
sold as " breeding cages " have a wooden compartment at the top of one 
end for nest-boxes, and a wired-off partition underneath, into which the 
young birds may be put when it is desirable to separate them from their 
parents. There are some advantages in these cages, and the birds which 
are shy and like retirement prefer them to the open cages ; the only 
objection to them is that they are inconveniently small 'when a large 
family is hatched, and that the nest-boxes are necessarily so high that the 
young birds sometimes fall, when they come out of the nest before they 
are fully fledged, and are injured thus. On this account I put nest- 
baskets into my cages, at a little distance from the floor, so that the young 
birds hop in and out easily ; and if the old birds should entangle their 
feet in the nest (which they sometimes do if the claws are long and they 
fly out in a hurry), and the young birds are thrown out of it, they are not 
likely to be so much hurt as if they fell from the greater height. My 
breeding cages have compartments for the separate pairs, three in each, 
the centre space being kept for the young birds of each family, that they 
may be fed through the wires by the old birds, when they have left the 
nest, but cannot feed themselves. This space is necessary, too, to prevent 
quarrels, as the birds on each side of the wire partition will sometimes 
try to fight, and make furious assaults on their neighbours through the 
bars, or jealousies will arise to break their domestic peace, if, while the 
hen is sitting, her husband chooses to feed his neighbour's wife through 
the wires. The pairs should be kept as retired and out of sight of each 
other as possible. The materials for the nest should be hung up in the 
cage in a little net ; fine moss and cow-hair are best ; if cotton wadding 
is given it is apt to get matted and clogged round the bird's claws. The 
hen will generally make the nest herself ; but some birds are idle about 
it, and do not take the trouble to do more than to put a little moss or 
wool into the basket, and then it is as well to make a nest for her ; but il 
is not at all certain that she will allow it to remain in the basket. Some 



The Canary. 445 



birds seem to prefer sitting on their eggs without a nest, or are very- 
capricious about its formation, and will undo one day the work of the 
previous day. It is as well to leave them to their own devices till the 
young are hatched, and then they may have a little moss or cow-hair put 
in under them to make their bed softer. The hen generally lays four or 
five eggs, and sits thirteen or fourteen days, unless she or her mate have 
a bad habit of eating the eggs. They should be left in the nest, and not 
touched or interfered with at all, until a fortnight has elapsed after the 
laying of the last egg ; then, if there are no signs of hatching, the eggs 
may be put into warm water : if they float the probability is that they are 
addled, and no young bird in the egg ; if they sink, they may be replaced 
for a day or two, but if not hatched then, they should be taken away, or 
the hen will go on sitting uselessly (on dead birds probably). Sometimes 
a violent jar, caused by the shutting of a door near the cage, or the fall of 
the cage itself, will kill the birds in the egg, or the mother bird will cause 
their death by allowing the eggs to get cold, if sitting irregularly. The 
egg food must be provided in readiness for the hatching ; and it is 
necessary to watch the birds' proceedings at first, lest they should not 
feed the young ones ; but very few canaries are unnatural enough to leave 
them unfed, although they do not like to be overlooked, and, if they are 
shy birds, will refuse to feed their little ones when they arc in sight, so 
that one has to watch them without appearing to do so. If they feed them 
once they will continue to do so ; if not, it will be needful to bring them 
up by hand, giving them the soft egg food with a quill, as with the nest- 
lings before mentioned. Afresh nest must be given if the first nest becomes 
dirty, and the young birds carefully transferred to it with no more touching 
than is necessary. Some parent birds will resent any interference with 
their young, and will desert if they are meddled with ; others will appear 
pleased at any notice bestowed on them, and will call our attention to their 
children with great exultation, chirping and flying up to the nest, looking 
in, and then looking up in our faces as if to say, " Pray admire my lovely 
infants." 

If our birds are as familiar with us as they ought to be, they will exhibit 
their confidence in our sympathy and make their wants known to us in a 
very pleasant and expressive manner : if they want fresh food or water they 
will go down to the glasses and look into them, and then look up at us and 
chirp ; or if anything is amiss with their nestlings, they will attract our 
attention to the nest by signals that cannot be mistaken. One bird who 
wanted materials for her nest went about the cage picking up stalks, and 
another pulled the hair of any human head that came within her reach, to 
show what she wanted. 

The young birds will generally be out of the nest in about a fortnight 
during the day, returning to it at night for warmth. The mother bird will 
often begin to lay again about this time, and must have a fresh nest given 
her ; and the young ones should be put into the nursery partition, so as 
to be fed through the wires (or in a small cage tied on to the larger one). 
They are apt to tease their mother, or to break the eggs, by jumping in and 
out of the nest while she is sitting. I have sometimes seen three or four 
little heads peeping out under her wings at once, and occasionally they will 
sit upon her, which in hot weather is almost too much to endure. The 
cock bird will feed them while she is sitting, and show them how to feed

themselves. They must have a supply of egg food, crushed seed, and water 
in their compartment, and by degrees they will become independent of 
their parents. The first moulting tries the young bird's strength much, 
and till it is over they must have the same food (egg food and crushed 
hemp-seed) in addition to their usual provisions. The hen should not be 
allowed to have more than two broods in the year, for her health's sake : 
if she goes on laying or sitting, the nest should be taken away from her ; 
and if that hint is not sufficient, she must be separated from the cock till 
she begins to moult. The young birds should be within hearing of a good 
songster till after their moulting is over, when they will begin to warble feebly. 
If a nightingale or woodlark were to be had as music master, they would 
learn his notes ; but I do not advise any one to keep these birds in confine- 
ment ; they are not fitted for it by temperament or constitution, and their 
song is much more glad and sweet in their native woods. I had one 
canary who had learned several nightingale notes, and used to repeat the 
"Jug; jug" continually : he would not sing in company with others, but 
taught the young birds very well from a little distance. They will often 
learn best when their singing master is out of sight. 

Cross-breeding has changed the canary of the present day greatly 
from the original wild green bird of Teneriffe and the Canary Isles, and 
the varieties of shape and plumage are endless. There are canary societies 
and bird-shows now, and prizes are given for birds which excel in beauty 
or song. They are arranged in different divisions, and connoisseurs talk 
knowingly of "jonques," "spangles," " mealy birds ;" "flaxen," "grey," 
"cinnamon," and "agate-coloured" canaries ; all which have their distin- 
guishing merits. Then there is the German canary, a small, compact, 
smooth bird, with a sweet but not very powerful voice ; and the Belgian, 
its opposite in every respect, very long and slender, with exceedingly high 
shoulders and long legs, standing so uprightly on its perch as to give one 
the idea that it would fall backwards. The Norwich, or London fancy 
prize canary, is a large square bird, with a massive head, deep orange in 
plumage all over the body, excepting the wings and tail, which should be 
black. This at least used to be the prize bird, but every season has its 
fashion in birds as well as in dress. To my mind it is the most beautiful 
of all the canaries when perfect, but it is very difficult to get one without 
white or green feathers, or irregularly marked ; and a perfect bird will 
become imperfect after its first two moults. This is the case also with the 
lizard canary, which should be of a greenish bronze throughout, excepting 
the crown of the head, which is yellow in the gold-spangled, and white in 
the silver-spangled lizard. The markings or spangles on the back are 
very uniform and regular, and there ought to be no yellow or white feathers 
in the wings or tail : but these generally come when the bird is two years old. 

Many of the foreign finches do well in cages or aviaries where a mo- 
derate degree of warmth is always preserved : they are very beautiful, and 
many sing as well as their English relations ; but they are rare and ex- 
pensive. They are fed on the same kind of food — canary, hemp, poppy, 
rape, millet-seed, &c., and generally require the same treatment as the 
canary. Many other seed-eating birds are more easily procured, and do 
equally well in confinement. It is impossible to enumerate half of these, 
and every year adds to the list of imported foreign birds ; I will only men- 
tion a few of those which I know personally as domestic pets. 



The Java Sparrow, etc. 



447 



The Java sparrows are very pretty and affectionate, and very happy in 
confinement ; and they are hardy, and can be kept even in an aviary where 
canaries would live. They are about the size of a bullfinch, and like it in 
shape ; grey in plumage, and so neat and smooth that the feathers seem 
to be arranged so as never to stand apart from one another, and all appear 
covered with bloom like that of plums ; the head and throat are black, the

cheeks white ; the beak thick like that of a bullfinch, but of a bright rose 
colour. The song is very poor and monotonous. They eat canary and 
millet-seed, but might well be fed on rice, one should think, as they are most 
destructive in Java and China in the rice-fields, and are called Paddybirds 
{Le Pcdda, on oiseau de riz — Buffon) on that account. 

The cut-throat and diamond sparrows are veiy pretty birds, about the

size of a goldfinch, and their feathers are beautifully marked and spangled ; 
but they are not interesting birds, and their harsh twittering is not agree-

The Dominican and Whidah Birds. 



able. Their food is the same as that of the Java sparrows, with the addi- 
tion of chickweed and cracknels, of which they are fond. 

The indigo bird, Dominican, and Whidah bird, are all buntings, 
easily to be procured, and veiy beautiful. The former comes from 
Carolina and the neighbourhood of New York : its plumage is bright 
blue throughout, excepting the larger quill feathers and tail, which are 
brown. It may be kept in a bell-shaped cage, and fed on millet, canary, 
poppy, and bruised hemp- 
seed. The song resembles 
that of the linnet. 

The Dominican and Whi- 
dah bird are both Africans : 
the latter is chiefly remark- 
able for its long and curious 
tail, for the accommodation 
of which it requires a very 
large cage. The body is 
about the size of that of the 
linnet. The head of the 
male bird is black, and the 
throat, wings, back, and tail 
are of the same colour ; the 
back of the neck is orange, 
and the breast and upper 
part of the stomach white. 
The four outer feathers of 
the tail are about four inches 
long, and very broad ; the 
next two are thirteen inches 
long, broad in the middle, and 
running almost to a point 
at the ends ; the two centre 
feathers are glossy, and a 
little arched, like those of a 
cock ; thread-like filaments 
spring from the longer fea- 
thers and float about with 
every movement of the bird, 
which is very lively, and 
seems to take great delight 
in bathing and trimming its 
feathers: it moults twice in 
the year, and is without its 
tail from November to May. 
The female is entirely brown, 
almost black, but does not 
acquire its full plumage until 
it is two or three years old. 
The Whidah bird has a low, 
soft, rather melancholy song. 
It should be fed on canary

and millet-seed and barley-meal, with lettuce, endive, and other green 
f od from time to time, and will live in confinement from eight to twelve 
years. The same treatment will answer for the Dominican, but a large 
bell-shaped cage is more suitable for this bird, whose tail is not so long. 

The cardinal grosbeak, or Virginian nightingale, is a very beautiful 
red bird, with glossy black feathers about the head and neck. It is about 
eight inches long, of which the tail measures three. The song is varied and 
constant, and continues all through the year, except while it is moulting. 
The hen, which is of a reddish-brown colour, is said to sing nearly as 
well as the cock ; and perhaps that is the reason why these birds are 
better apart — the cock is jealous of his mate's rivalry of voice. Bird 
dealers have so often pronounced an unfavourable opinion of the cardinal 
grosbeak as regards his capabilities as a domestic pet, that I was sur- 
prised to hear of one which was so exceedingly tame that he would 
carry his favourite tit-bits to his mistress, and try to make her eat 
crushed hemp and caterpillars ! The bird is naturally, I believe, very

nervous and sensitive, so that it would fret and chafe in a shop sur- 
rounded by other birds, and its wild fluttering would give the idea that 
it could never be tamed ; but patient kindness and gentleness will make 
it a most attractive and pleasant pet. It should be fed chiefly on canary- 
seed, but should have a few hemp-seeds every day, and four or five meal- 
worms, or spiders, grubs, or caterpillars — some animal food, in short, to 
keep it well and vigorous. Spanish nuts, almonds, walnuts, and Indian 
corn, may be given as a treat ; and a lump of basalt and a little piece 
of chalk should be put in the cage, and the bird should always be allowed 
a bath, and should be kept out of draughts. I give the directions which 
have been given to me by a lady whose Virginian nightingale has 
flourished under her judicious care many years. I have never had one 
myself. 

The beautiful little avadavats and waxbills I have kept, and I can 
thoroughly recommend them as pets for the drawing-room or conserva- 
tory. In the latter atmosphere they flourish best, for they are rather

delicate birds, and do not like changes of temperature. The Avadavats 
are very small red and brown birds, and with their bright red beaks, 
spreading fan-like tails, and spotted plumage, are exceedingly pretty. 
They sit in a line on a perch as close as possible together, and are very 
affectionate. Their song is sweet and soft, and one will stand up and 
warble for a few minutes, and then sit down, and another will spring up 
and sing and subside into quietude, and so on. It is the prettiest thing 
imaginable to see a number of these little creatures in a cage of delicate 
workmanship, darting about, pluming themselves, washing, and singing, 
and appearing so thoroughly happy. They live very sociably with Silver 
Beaks, Cordon Bleus, and Australian, African, St. Helena, Orange, and 
Zebra Wax Bills, which are about their own size, and require the same 
food and warmth. They feed chiefly on millet-seed, but will eat canary- 
seed as well, and must be abundantly supplied with water. It is neces- 
sary, however, to take precautions against their being chilled by being 
too constantly in the bath, especially in winter. They are so fond of

washing that they will get into their water-glass, if possible, all day long, 
and I lost several of my birds from excessive bathing : I could not keep 
them out of the water, and when the sun was not shining, of course they 
could not get dry or warm for some time after they had been ducking 
themselves so thoroughly. I kept them in a cage made on purpose for 
them, with fine silver wires and glass sides round the lower half of the 
cage ; but I do not think this answered for them. The glass prevented 
the floor from getting dry quickly after it had been wetted by the splash- 
ing of the water, and it never looked clean for the same reason — it was 
so constantly splashed. The wires must be small and closely put 
together, as the birds would get out between the wires of an ordinary 
cage ; but I think tin wire is preferable to silver, and more easily kept 
clean. The birds must have a thick covering at night, and never be 
exposed to chilling draughts. A conservatory or greenhouse, kept at a 
moderate degree of heat always, is certainly the most desirable abode for 
these little foreigners. 

An article on domestic pets seems scarcely complete without some

notice of parrots and parrakeets ; but there are so many varieties of this 
tribe of birds, and they come from so many parts of the world, that they 
require a book to themselves. I can only make a few suggestions for their 
treatment generally. Those which are natives of tropical climates require 
warmth and abundance of farinaceous food and fruit. Bread and milk 
should be the staple prison diet of parrots (the bread should be soaked 
first in boiling water, squeezed as dry as possible, and then allowed to 
absorb as much fresh boiled milk as it will hold), adding Indian corn, 
biscuits, nuts, almonds (not bitter almonds), fruit (hard and soft), peach 
and plum kernels, cherries; grapes, pears, &c, grain, and seed for the

larger birds ; and the smaller kinds should have hemp, canary, and millet 
seeds, with fruit. All should have water for drinking and bathing within 
reach ; and if the birds will not go into water, it is well to sprinkle a little 
warm water on them occasionally, and put them into the sunshine that 
they may plume themselves and clean their feathers. Great cleanliness 
is necessary to keep parrots in health, and their feet must be frequently 
washed if they get dirty and they will not bathe themselves. They are 
subject to diseased feet, and their perches should be covered with flannel, 
and the bottom of the cage should have a grating with a drawer under- 
neath it always covered with sand. Lettuce or water-cress may be giver

to these birds occasionally ; and it is said that a chili-pod given from time 
to time is useful — when they are moulting they may have one or two cut 
up small once a week. If they have an attack of asthma they should have 
a few grains of cayenne-pepper mixed with their bread and milk. Meat, 
sugar, and sweetmeats, are all unwholesome for parrots. 

Within the last few years a great number of the Australian grass parra- 
keets have been brought to England. They were very expensive at first, 
but I should suppose they must be cheap now, for I hear of some thousands 
being brought over at once for sale. They are very delightful pets, and 
their plumage is very beautiful : one of the most charming is the warbling 
grass parrakeet or budgerigar, which is said to breed in captivity. Those 
which I kept were, I think, confined in too small a cage, and to see them 
to advantage they should be in a large, or rather a long cage, along which 
they can run, or in a room or aviary. In their native land they feed in 
large flocks upon the grass seeds in the plains, and rest during the heat of 
the day upon the branches of the gum-trees, in the hollows of which they 
lay their eggs. Their plumage is very 
beautiful; green is the prevailing 
colour, but it is very much spotted 
with black, and the breast and under 
tail feathers are yellow, and some of 
the feathers of the wings blue-black. 
They have bright blue spots on the 
cheeks, and the only distinctive mark 
of the sexes is, that the cock bird has 
bluish nostrils and the hen brown 
ones. They are very loving birds, 
and are continually caressing each 
other, keeping up a constant chirping 
and chattering all the time. My pair 
would sometimes flap their wings and 
utter a harsh disagreeable cry, but 
I think this was owing to their dislike 
to the smallness of their cage. I put 
a cocoa-nut into it in the hope that 
they may be induced to breed, but 
they never took any notice of it, ex- 
cept to bite the outside, and I imagined 
that they ought to have a cage four 
feet long to live in, and to be left in a 
much quieter room than mine was ; they are shy birds, and I could never 
succeed in making mine familiar with me — they were never tempted by 
any dainty I could offer them, and, indeed, never approached any food to 
which they were not accustomed, so that I could not change their diet : 
the only treat they had was a bundle of oats, out of which they could pull 
the grain, and that they appeared to like. I used sometimes to let them 
out of their cage, and their great delight was to run along the green bars 
of the Venetian blinds ; but they were so crafty that I found it impossible 
to catch them, and sometimes had to wait till late in the day before hunger 
induced them to return to their cage, and then they would often pop in and 
out again before any one could shut the door of the cage. They lived

The Dove.

very contentedly in the large winter cage with the canaries, but took very 
little notice of them, being too much occupied with one another to care for 
others. The hen is said to lay her two eggs about Christmas, and to be 
a very attentive mother, but I could not get mine even to enter the cocoa- 
nut I was told to provide for a nest. These birds seemed to like to get 
hold of a large piece of gravel to carry about the cage, so I put a piece of 
charcoal in for them, but I do not think they touched it. I always gave 
them water, but they did not drink much, and I never saw them bathe, 
although Australian travellers speak of flocks of them coming regularly 
every evening to the springs of water. Like the love-birds, which they 
much resemble, these parrakeets are unhappy alone, and must always 
have a companion. 

This is the case also with doves, which look very disconsolate without 
a mate, to whom they are constantly cooing. They are pretty, gentle, 
quiet birds, and easily tamed. The stock dove, ring dove, turtle dove, 
and collared turtle, are all kept in confinement, but they should all have a 
great deal of air. If kept in a wicker cage, it should be carried indoors 
at night (for, being natives of hot countries, they do not bear cold well), 
and taken out of doors early in the morning. The German peasants keep 




Doves- 



doves constantly in their cottages, from a fancy that they cure colds and 
rheumatism by taking the complaints themselves ; and I believe it is true 
that doves are subject to the diseases which people shut up in the same 
room with them have, such as small-pox, swollen legs, and tumours in the 
feet ; but this is probably due to the close unwholesome condition and bad 
air of the room, which affects birds and human beings alike. They are 
best kept in a conservatory or aviary, unless they are tame enough to fly

in and out of the house, and return to their cages at night or when they 
want food, in which case they may be allowed their liberty. They must 
have plenty of fine dry gravel and conveniences for bathing, and their food 
should be barley, wheat, pease, vetches, hemp, and canary seed. They 
like variety in it, and are fond of bread dry or soaked, the seeds of pines 
and firs, and linseed and myrtle berries. They ought to have bay salt 
mixed with old mortar or gravel : the salt is good for their throats, which 
often become diseased. Doves generally have two broods in the year, two 
young ones at a time, which they feed from their crops. I have been told 
that they are often unnatural enough to neglect this duty ; but I do not 
think this is generally the case. The young are so dependent upon their 
parents, that they could hardly be reared by hand. They are not very 
interesting birds, but have great beauty of plumage, and no disagreeable 
characteristics to detract from their merits as domestic pets. 

It may be remarked by my readers that I have not recommended the 
nightingales, larks, and many of our most renowned songsters to be kept 
in confinement. I have not done so, because they are not fitted by Nature 
to be imprisoned in cages. Those especially which are migratory birds 
are restless and miserable when the season comes for their flight to other 
countries ; they will beat wildly against the bars of their prison, forsake 
their food, and gasp for breath, and when quieter, will be very dull and 
moping for some days. This is one of the difficulties of keeping nightin- 
gales, which suffer much from this impulse to migrate. They require a 
spacious cage, at least 20 inches long, 9 broad, and 12 high ; the roof

should be lined with green baize or some soft material, and the three 
perches with which it should be provided must be covered with this to 
protect the birds' feet, which are very tender. They are fond of bathing, 
but care must be taken that the cage does not become saturated with 
water. Some nightingales dislike a strong light, and will not sing in sun- 
shine, and they must be humoured and treated very gently. If possible, 
they should be allowed an unfurnished room to live in, and if the sun 
enters this freely, and they can fly about among fir branches or other 
evergreens, with plenty of sand, clean water, and the food they like, they

will be much happier and healthier than in a cage, although, perhaps, 
they may not sing as well, especially if in company with other birds, as 
in solitary confinement. They must have ants' eggs and meal-worms 
daily, if possible ; if not, their food should be roasted bullock's heart, and 
raw carrot grated, and a little lean beef or mutton, stale bread, and hard 
egg occasionally, ripe elderberries, and spiders and caterpillars. They 
need animal food daily, and when moulting require the most nourishing 
diet, and to be protected from cold and draughts. They are fond of boiled 
vegetables, and pudding, bread soaked in milk and squeezed dry, and 
scalded hemp-seed crushed, and various pastes are given to them and 
other soft-billed birds, which seem to agree well with nightingales. 

The Blackcap, which is sometimes called the Mock nightingale, red- 
start, whitethroat, and other warblers, require much the same treatment. 
The blackcap should never be without fruit of some kind, cherries, cur- 
rants, raspberries, elderberries, or ripe apples. For all these birds, Mr. 
Sweet recommends hemp-seed soaked in boiling water and bruised, 
mixed with scalded bread (made without salt), and a little lean meat finely 
minced. This must of course be given fresh every morning, and the 
birds should have hard egg also. Other bird-fanciers recommend boiled 
carrot or beetroot mashed, and pastes made of white bread twice baked 
and pounded, with milk poured upon it, and mixed with barley meal or 
wheat meal, and the " German Paste ;; made as follows : — Heat two table-

spoonfuls of melted lard, free from salt, in a saucepan till nearly boiling ; 
stir into this while near, not on, the fire, four tablespoonfuls of treacle, and 
three pints and a half of pea-meal till the mixture becomes a stiff crumbly 
paste ; a few more seeds may be mixed with this, or a little stale bread 
grated, or well boiled mealy potato can be added to it when given to the 
birds. It will keep a long time in a glass ja,r, and both seed-eating and 
soft-billed birds will thrive on it. If birds of various kinds are kept 
together in a room or aviary, it is necessary to give some general food 
which those that live upon seeds, insects, berries, and fruit, may equally 
enjoy, and these pastes are suitable for all. The seed-eating birds have a 
mixture of seeds as well, and the insectivorous birds should be supplied 
with meal-worms, cockroaches, and crickets, easily procured from a baker's 
shop, and dried ants' eggs. These can be obtained in summer by un-

covering a nest of the large wood ant, and placing the eggs on a cloth 
in the sun, with the corners turned up over small leafy branches. The 
ants, in order to protect them from the sun, will carry their eggs under 
shelter, and thus they are procured free from dirt and from the ants also. 




Gold- Crested Wren. 

They may be dried in a frying-pan on sand over a slow fire, and kept in 
the sand in a jar all through the winter. All birds like them. The most 
beautiful of our small birds, the gold-crested wrens, delight in them, and 
must have them as well as bread-and-milk or soaked biscuit beaten up 
with milk ; but these are such delicate birds, and suffer so much from

cold, that it is very difficult to keep them alive through the winter. They 
might do well in a plant case lined with a fine woollen net, with a myrtle 
or tiny fir tree to perch upon. They, like the robins, are quarrelsome 
birds, and do not live well with others in a confined space. Titmice are 
such murderous little creatures, that it is cruel to put them with other 
birds, for, besides fighting with them continually, they will hang on to 
them and hug them round the neck, to rob them of any dainty food they 
are eating, to which they may take a fancy, and torment them exceedingly. 
Robins and larks can only be kept happily in an outdoor aviary. This

should be constructed of iron and glass upon a basement of brick or 
stone, with an earthen floor beaten hard, and be warmed by pipes, so as 
to keep up an even temperature in cold weather. The glass should 
have wire within it, so as to be opened freely in summer, and be shaded 
by blinds at pleasure, unless it is well sheltered by creeping plants 
without, and should be provided with wooden shutters for the winter. 
Within the aviary there should be a small fountain playing in the centre, 
with a basin for the birds to drink and bathe in, and plenty of dwarf 
shrubs and creepers for them to build and hide in. It is best to keep 
these in pots when practicable, in order to change them for fresh shrubs 
when they become spoiled. The seed should be put in bird-hoppers 




Skylark. 

against the wall, and there should be shelves and perches for the birds to 
roost on, and in the breeding season, wicker baskets and boxes for them 
to build in. The floor of the aviary must be kept covered with sand and 
small gravel, and old mortar well dried and bruised is good for the birds 
also. Of course, anything belonging to the aviary must be as clean as 
possible, and the water always fresh and cool. In fitting up aviaries or 
cages, the natural habits and tastes of the birds which are to live in them 
must be carefully considered — their comfort is sometimes sacrificed to 
ornament — and they should always have shade as well as sunshine provided 
for them, and snug corners for those who love retirement. Care must be 
taken to exclude fog and damp, and in sweeping out the aviary, to avoid 
raising much dust, from which the sensitive lungs of many of the birds 
would suffer exceedingly. The air from a close stove or any noxious 
gas too, would cause them much discomfort, if it did not stop their 
respiration altogether, so that means must be taken to secure good 
ventilation. 

If we keep birds in captivity at all, it is our bounden duty to keep 
them as healthy and happy as possible ; and unless we are well acquainted 
with their several wants and characteristic tastes, we cannot expect them 
to be our fond familiar friends, or to delight us with the exhibition of their 
natural beauties and talents. We must love our little prisoners and con- 
sult their happiness if we would entice them to treat us as friends, rather 
than gaolers,

PRESCRIPTIONS 

For SLIGHT FAMILY AILMENTS, REMEDIES in 
CASES of ACCIDENTAL POISONING, Etc. 

BY A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS. 



Boils and Carbuncles. 

Symptoms. — Boils are distinguish- 
able from carbuncles by their smaller 
size, by their conical shape, inflamed 
base, and tendency to form matter 
at the point. Beneath the matter is 
a portion of dead tissue, or " core." 

Carbuncle is a large and flat- 
tened compound boil, without the 
tendency to present a conical point. 
A carbuncle tends to form matter, 
and opens at various parts of its sur- 
face. At these points the skin gives 
way, presenting a riddled aspect, 
gradually running into one sore. The 
inflamed base of a carbuncle ex- 
tends wider than that of a boil, and 
has a harder feel, resembling indeed 
the consistence of brawn. 

The pain of a carbuncle is often 
very severe. The constitutional dis- 
turbance is marked by a low state 
of the vital powers. 

Treatment. — A small boil requires 
no treatment beyond protection from 
friction, by diachylon or soap plas- 
ter. If, however, it be large, in- 
flamed, and painful, water dressing 
or warm poultices should be applied, 
until the core has sloughed out. It 
should then be dressed with zinc 
ointment. 

A carbuncle should, in the first 
instance, be kept well covered with 
the water dressing protected by oil 
silk, until the surface begins to give 
way, and presents numerous small 
yellow points of matter ; it should 
then be dressed with strips of lint 
smeared with the yellow basilicon 
ointment, covered outside with linen, 



moistened with Condy's fluid or car- 
bolic oil, if there be any offensive 
odour. After the slough of dead 
tissue beneath the skin has sepa- 
rated, the sore may be dressed with 
zinc ointment. 

The diet should be full and nutri- 
tious, with a moderate allowance of 
stimulants. 

The medicines that will be useful 
will be quinine, compound tincture 
of bark, muriated tincture of iron, &c. 

Bruises. The variation of the 
colours of bruises is owing to changes 
going on in the blood which has 
been effused under the skin by vio- 
lence. A bruise generally goes 
through all the various tints from 
black to green and yellowish-green. 
Bruises sometimes, from the large 
quantity of blood effused, become 
inflamed and form abscesses. 

Treatment. — To prevent or dimi- 
nish discoloration from bruises, it is 
as well to apply cold or warm water 
as soon after the violence has been 
done as possible. To allay the swell- 
ing or inflamation which may fol- 
low, cooling lotions should be used. 
A mixture of tincture of arnica and 
water has been strongly recommend- 
ed, but a mixture of spirit and water, 
or spirit, vinegar, and water, will be 
found quite as efficacious. 
Spirits of wine, I oz. 
Vinegar, I oz. 
Water, to 4 oz. 

Graze or Abrasion. — An abrasion 
of the skin, or what is commonly 
termed " barked skin," is the sim- 
plest form of wound. It consists

in the superficial skin being rubbed 
off by violence. This form of injury 
of course varies in severity as the 
amount of violence varies. 

Treatment. — For a slight abrasion 
a piece of linen or lint wetted with 
cold water, and covered with oil- 
silk or gutta-percha tissue, will gene- 
rally be sufficient dressing. Or it 
may be covered with goldbeater's 
skin. 

For a graze or bruised wound of 
considerable extent or depth, a dress- 
ing of carbolic acid and oil will be 
found a very serviceable applica- 
tion. Take of carbolic, I part ; best 
olive oil, 28 parts — apply on lint or 
soft linen. 

In a majority of cases any simple 
application that will protect the de- 
nuded surface, while it is being 
skinned over, is enough — e.g., sper- 
maceti ointment, spread on linen, 
will be all that is required. One 
method of treatment for abrasions 
is to apply a piece of dry lint, and 
let the blood soak into it. This 
may be allowed to dry on the sore, 
and thus form an artificial scab ; or 
the lint may first be soaked in com- 
pound tincture of Benzoin, known as 
Friar's Balsam. 

Burns and Scalds. The effect 
of these will vary with the extent of 
surface, or the depth of skin injured 
or destroyed. Recovery, moreover, 
must depend greatly upon the state 
of health at the time of the accident. 
Under ordinary states of health a 
superficial scald or burn, not destroy- 
ing the skin below the surface and 
not involving more than half the 
superfices, may be recovered from. 
Less than half of this extent of 
burn may, however, be fatal, if it 
extend to the true skin and the 
muscles below. 

Burns as a rule destroy more than 
scalds. Scalds usually form blisters 
and go no deeper, but burns may 
char the deeper skin and the mus- 



cles beneath ; they are, therefore, 
the more dangerous of the two. 

Treatment —Should the burn have 
resulted from the clothes catching 
fire, they should carefully be re- 
moved, so as not to break the 
blisters which may be forming or 
formed, lest violence be done to the 
raw skin beneath, and, for the same 
reason, pieces of the clothing that 
stick to the surface should not be 
removed at the time. If the burn 
or scald be extensive, some stimu- 
lant wine and water should be given 
at once to diminish the effect of 
"shock." 

Treatment. — The principle to be 
observed in the treatment of burns 
and scalds, is to cause a gradual 
diminution of heat in the part, not 
to allow it to cool too quickly. This 
is effected by protecting the burnt or 
scalded part from the air, by imme- 
diately dredging with flour, or cover- 
ing with cotton-wool or oil. If the 
case is a slight one, these dressings 
may be left on for a day or two ; but 
if it be more severe the damaged 
parts should be dressed with lint, 
spread with basilicon or resin oint- 
ment, or a mixture of equal parts 
of that ointment and spirits of 
turpentine. 

Another useful lotion for appli- 
cation to burns and scalds of slight 
extent consists of " carron oil," or — 
Lime-water, 1 part, 
Linseed-oil, 2 parts, 
well shaken together, and applied 
by means of strips of lint, or soft 
linen rag soaked in it, and changed 
twice a day. 

The Blisters: Jiow to be treated. — 
It is generally advisable not to cut 
the blisters which may be formed, 
as they protect the true skin under 
them ; but if the base of the blister 
shows symptoms of inflammation, 
it is as Avell to evacuate the con- 
tents, but even then to do it by 
means of a small prick, and to leave 



460 



Accidents ; jDiseases, and Symptoms. 



the skin on, so that it may protect 
the raw surface from the air. 

The black char of skin that is 
sometimes left should be poulticed 
with bread, or linseed meal and 
bread, till the slough separates. 
When this has taken place, there 
is left a surface of what appear to 
be little mounds of flesh, and these 
give out a discharge of matter. 
They are called granulations, and 
are the commencements of the pro- 
cess of healing, At times these 
granulations grow very rapidly and 
abundantly, rising above the level 
of the adjacent skin. This is what is 
commonly meant by " proud flesh." 
Their growth may be checked by 
gently touching them with a stick 
of nitrate of silver, and dressing 
the surface with oxide of zinc 
ointment. 

Burns between the fingers, or in 
any place where two contiguous 
surfaces are likely to come in con- 
tact, should be separately dressed, 
and great care should be taken to 
keep the granulating surfaces apart, 
or they may grow together and 
produce deformity. 

Treatment of the cicatrices. — Scars 
are often left after extensive burns. 
These scars contract, and have been 
known to produce great deformities, 
such as the head being pulled down 
on the shoulder, the arm bent at the 
elbow, the leg contracted at the 
knee. This may generally be reme- 
died by keeping up gentle move- 
ment, or by keeping the limbs ex- 
tended until the process is complete. 

Opiates. — If there be much pain, 
it will be advisable to give opium, 
in the form of the tincture, as it will 
also allay nervous excitement. 

Tincture of opium, 10 minims. 

Water, 1 teaspoonful. 
Every four hours. 

This dose, it should be borne in 
mind, is for an adult person. 

Burns from Chemicals, — The de- 



structive chemicals most likely to 
produce these accidents are — sul- 
phuric acid, or oil of vitriol ; nitric 
acid, or aqua fortis ; ammonia, and 
hydrofluoric acid ; strong carbolic 
acid, and chloride of zinc. In cases 
of burns from any of these the parts 
should be well washed with water, 
in which a little bicarbonate of soda 
is dissolved, or soap and water in 
the case of the acids. Afterwards 
treat as in a case of inflammatory 
ulcer or ordinary burn. 

Gunpowder Burns. — Explosions 
of gunpowder cause destruction of 
skin, and resemble burns or scalds 
in their effects. They should be 
treated in the same manner as burns, 
first removing particles of carbon 
by means of a soft sponge and 
warm water. 

The diet in severe burns should 
be supporting. Some stimulant is 
usually advisable. 

Chapped Hands. After wash- 
ing the hands, and before drying 
them, pour over the backs of them 
some glycerine and water (equal pro- 
portions), smear it over them, and 
then quickly dip into water and dry 
the hands gently, so as not entirely 
to wipe off the glycerine. 

Chilblains. The best remedy 
for these, when not broken, is to 
paint them twice a day with strong 
tincture of iodine. 

A liniment of equal parts of ex- 
tract of lead and spirits of turpen- 
tine is also very useful . 

If inflamed and broken, they 
should be poulticed and dressed 
with some simple ointment. 

Cold. Remedy for. — A useful 
means of cure in catarrhal bron- 
chitis or severe " cold," is the in- 
halation of ammonia ; thus, put a 
teaspoonful of spirits of salvolatile in 
a three-pint jug, with a wide mouth, 
then fill the jug half full with boil- 
ing water, and holding the face over 
the mouth of the jug, inhale the

steam as long as it continues to be 
given off. 

Child-crowing-. Spasms of the 
Glottis. Symptoms. — This is a con- 
vulsion or spasmodic affection of the 
upper part of the windpipe, causing 
sudden difficulty of breathing, and 
accompanied with a shrill crowing 
noise resembling that of a young 
bantam cock. The paroxysm comes 
on almost instantaneously, very often 
after a fit of crying ; or the child 
will start up out of its sleep and be 
seized with the crowing noise. It 
has been known to be suddenly fatal 
without the slightest warning. This 
affection occurs in weakly children, 
and in apparantly fine healthy chil- 
dren of a strumous constitution. 
The paroxysm may be excited by 
any circumstances that depress the 
constitutional powers or derange the 
digestive organs. Thus teething, or 
injudicious feeding, may excite one. 

Child-crowing is veiy often con- 
founded with croup, but it is a dis- 
tinct affection, more alarming in its 
character, and requires distinctive 
treatment. Croup is a catarrhal 
affection in the first instance, and is 
frequently preceded by the symp- 
toms of a cold on the chest. The 
paroxysm of croup, although it 
may be sometimes of a spasmodic 
character, does not as suddenly pass 
off as does child-crowing, but leaves 
a rough, difficult kind of breathing 
and hoarse, croupy cough after it. 
The croupy sound is rather of a 
rough sawing character, and accom- 
panies both inspiration and expira- 
ration. Child-crowing occurs only 
in inspiration. 

Treatment. — Whatever treatment 
is to be adopted must be put in 
force in the intervals of the attacks, 
as there is no time then to do any- 
thing more than to sprinkle cold 
water on the face. 

If the paroxysms recur at short 
intervals, four or five drops of chloric 



ether should be given every two or 
three hours. If there be any known 
disordered function, it should be 
corrected if possible. Thus, if the 
bc*.vels be costive, some mild aperi- 
ent should be administered. If the 
gums are full and swollen from teeth- 
ing they should be lanced. The 
condition of the general health is, 
however, by far the most important 
indication to be followed, and herein 
is the reason why it is specially 
necessary to be clear in distinguish- 
ing the disease from croup, because 
the treatment of the two is opposite. 

In child-crowing, the child should 
be out of doors as much as the 
weather will permit, and the higher 
and drier the situation the better. 
The most nourishing diet, consistent 
with a care not to overload the 
stomach, should be allowed. 

The following should be given : — 
Take of 

Syrup of bromide of iron, \ oz. 

Simple syrup, 1^ oz. 
Mix. Give a teaspoonful three times 
a day to a child over two years of 
age. and half the quantity to one 
under that age. 

Concussion of the Brain, 
Symptoms. — This condition may be 
the result of either a fall, or blow on 
the head, or it may be occasioned 
by a violent jerk to the bod}-, 
especially to the lower part of the 
spine. After one or other of these 
accidents, the symptoms of con- 
cussion will be : — Unconsciousness, 
and loss of power of moving, a 
small and feeble pulse, the pupil of 
the eye insensible to light, the com- 
plexion pallid, skin cold, and there 
may be vomiting. Convulsions, 
also, are likely to occur if a child is 
the subject of concussion. 

Treatme?it. — Small quantities of 
stimulants, such as wine, brandy, 
ether, or salvolatile in water, should 
be given every half hour, if the 
patient can swallow, until signs of 



462 



Accidents, Diseases, and Symptoms. 



reaction begin to show themselves. 
This will be known by the restora- 
tion of warmth and colour to the 
surface of the body, together with 
increased force in the pulse, and 
gradually reviving consciousness. 

From this point, health may be 
re-established, or inflammation, or 
some other affection of the brain, 
may follow. Hence the importance 
of cautious and judicious administra- 
tion of stimulants during the stage of 
depression which follows the shock. 

Convulsions, or Fits, are, 
strictly speaking, symptoms, not a 
disease ; thus they are seen in the low 
weak state of the termination of dis- 
ease of various kinds ; they are seen 
in hysterical excitement, and are 
caused generally by the disturbance 
of dentition. 

Treatment. — At the time of the 
convulsions but little can really be 
done — cold water maybe dashed on 
the face, and mustard plasters ap- 
plied to the soles of the feet and 
calves of the legs. 

In the fits of children — the child's 
body being immersed in a hot bath 
— cold water should be poured on 
the head from a jug held at a good 
height. The hot bath, however, 
cannot be repeated if the fits recur 
with frequency ; the cold water can 
always with safety be poured on 
the head. 

Hysterical convulsions, or fits, also 
require the free application of the 
cold douche on the. face and head. 

The curative treatment of convul- 
sions can only be attempted during 
their intervals, according to their 
several causes. 

Corns. Repeated soaking of 
the feet in hot water and paring 
down the corn with a sharp knife, 
.then applying nitrate of silver, and 
I afterwards paring off the hardened 
j black skin. Corn-plasters, having a 
thole in the centre, give great relief 
' also in wearing. 



Soft-corns are relieved by soaking 
in warm water, and the subsequent 
application of nitrate of silver. A 
thick plaster, to take off unequal 
pressure, is extremely serviceable. 

Croup. This is a disease which 
is alarming from the suddenness of 
its attack and the rapidity with 
which it runs its fatal course if un- 
checked ; but, on the other hand, 
in the majority of cases, it is easily 
checked if the treatment begins 
immediately it occurs. 

Symptoms. — The following is 
generally the course of the dis- 
ease : — A child is put to bed in its 
ordinary health, apparently, or it 
may have a slight cold, and a cough 
a trifle rough, but not enough to 
excite attention to it. After a vari- 
able time the child wakes up with a 
hoarse, ringing, rasping cough and 
difficulty in breathing, and counten- 
ance expressive of its trouble ; each 
inspiration and expiration being at- 
tended with a rough metallic tubular 
sound, and the voice masked or ob- 
literated by a harsh, hoarse croaking 
vocalization. The cough is dry, 
harassing, and unattended with ex- 
pectoration in the outset, but after a 
while some portions of membrane- 
like mucus may be coughed up. The 
pulse becomes rapid, the skin hot, 
the countenance more and more dis- 
tressed, and if relief be not afforded, 
the patient becomes drowsy, the 
complexion becomes blue, and the 
little patient may die from suffo- 
cation within forty-eight hours. 
Happily, however, this is not the 
most common course of the disease, 
if the treatinent be prompt and 
active. 

The first thing to be done is to 
give a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha 
wine every ten minutes until vomit- 
ing occurs. Ipecacuanha wine is 
preferable to antimonial wine, as the 
latter is too depressing. 

[N.13, — Where children are sub- 



Accidents, Diseases, aud Symptoms. 



463 



ject to croup, ipecacuanha wine 
should always be at hand.] 

Meanwhile, a hot bath should be 
prepared, and used as quickly as 
possible ; and while in the hot bath 
a wet sponge, sprinkled with mus- 
tard, should be held on the upper 
part of the chest and front of the 
neck. 

After the vomiting has subsided, 
small doses of the ipecacuanha wine 
(from five to fifteen drops, according 
to the age of the child) should be 
continued every three hours, until 
the hoarseness in the breathing and 
voice ceases and the cough becomes 
loose. 

The atmosphere of the bedroom 
should be kept warm and moist by 
steam from a pipe or spout of a 
kettle. The temperature should not 
be allowed to fall below 6o°, if 
possible. 

The diet light and simple. 

If, however, within twelve hours 
there be not a decided improvement, 
small doses of calomel should be 
given also, and the front of the neck 
should be painted with blistering 
liquid. 

As a last resource, supposing these 
remedies are not at hand or obtain- 
able, and the disease be making 
rapid strides, life may be saved by 
applying scalding water to the neck, 
holding it there on a sponge or 
flannel for a minute at least. This 
is a most extreme and violent means, 
but it is one by which the writer has 
seen a life saved. 

Diarrhoea. There is a com- 
mon form of this disorder, which 
appears very often in hot weather 
without any other indication, and 
which if neglected will lead to fully- 
developed cholera, if that disease or 
its causes be at the time prevalent ; 
while, on the other hand, it is easily 
arrested if taken in time. 

Treatment. — For an ordinary 
attack of diarrhoea — not arising 



from any known cause, such as 
irregularity of diet — a dose of the 
common chalk mixture (one ounce) 
with a drachm of tincture of catechu, 
repeated every three or four hours, 
will generally prove sufficient. If 
otherwise, three or four drops of 
creasote mixed with a teaspoonful 
of spirits of salvolatile in a wineglass 
of water, will check it. 

If the diarrhoea be profuse, and 
attended with much pain, a single 
dose of one grain of opium (taken 
as a pill) will often be sufficient for 
the purpose of relieving pain and 
arresting the complaint. This dose 
is for an adult only. 

Diarrhoea occurring in infants and 
young children is best controlled by 
one or two teaspoonsfuls of chalk 
mixture, given after each loose 
purge. 

If it prove obstinate, the following 
will most probably be efficacious : — 

Take a few chips of logwood, and 
boil for half an hour in half a pint 
of water. Mix two ounces of this 
decoction with half a drachm of 
powdered alum, and enough pow- 
dered sugar to sweeten it, and give 
a teaspoonful after each action of 
the bowels. 

Dog" Bites. These are very 
much, though somewhat unneces- 
sarily, dreaded, on account of the 
fear which exists that they may be 
followed by hydrophobia. When it 
is considered how many people are 
bitten by dogs, and how few people 
have hydrophobia, it will be seen of 
what groundless nature is that fear. ' 

The best method of treatment 
which can be pursued in dog bites 
is to make a free application of lunar 
caustic to the bite. Sometimes (if 
the dog be known to be undoubtedly 
rabid) it might be recommended 
that the part bitten should be re- 
moved by incision, but as for this it 
will be advisable to have the help of 
a surgeon, it is better in his absence

to apply a stick of nitrate of silver 
freely. 

Drowning*, or Suspended 
Animation. The following in- 
structions, compiled by the Royal 
National Lifeboat Institution, are 
the result of a wide field of expe- 
rience : — 

Restorative Treatment. — Send 
immediately for medical assistance, 
blankets, and dry clothing, but pro- 
ceed to treat the patient instantly, 
on the spot, in the open air, with 
the face downwards, whether on 
shore or afloat ; exposing the face, 
neck, and chest to the wind, except 
in severe weather, and removing all 
tight clothing from the neck and 
chest, especially the braces. The 
points to be aimed at are — first, 
and immediately, the restoration of I 
breathing ; and secondly, after 
breathing is restored, the promotion 
of warmth and circulation. The 
efforts to restore breathing must be 
commenced immediately and ener- 
getically, and persevered in for one 
or two hours, or until a medical 
man has pronounced that life is ex- 
tinct. Efforts to promote warmth 
and circulation, beyond removing 
the wet clothes and drying the skin, 
must not be made until the first ap- 
pearance of natural breathing. For 
if the circulation of the blood be 
induced before breathing has re- 
commenced, the restoration to life 
will be endangered. 

To Restore 'Breathing. — Place the 
patient on the floor or ground, with 
the face downwards, and one of the 
arms under the forehead, in which 
position all fluids will more readily 
escape by the mouth, and the tongue 
itself will fall forward, leaving the 
entrance into the windpipe free. 
Assist this operation by wiping and 
cleansing the mouth. 

If satisfactory breathing commen- 
ces, use the treatment prescribed 
below to promote warmth. If there 



be only slight breathing or no 
breathing, or if the breathing fail, 
then, to excite breathing, turn the 
patient well and instantly on the 
side, supporting the head ; and ex- 
cite the nostrils with snuff, harts- 
horn, and smelling-salts, or tickle 
the throat with a feather, if they are 
at hand. Rub the chest and face 
warm, and dash cold water, or cold 
and hot water alternately, on them. 
If there be no success, lose not a 




moment, but instantly — to imitate 
breathing— replace the patient on 
the face, raising and supporting the 
chest well on a folded coat or other 
article of dress. Turn the body 
very gently on the side and a little 
beyond, and then briskly on the 
face, back again ; repeating these 
measures cautiously, efficiently, and 
perseveringly, about fifteen times in 
a minute, or once every four or five 
seconds, occasionally varying the 
side. On each occasion that the 
body is replaced on the face, make 
uniform, but efficient pressure, with 
brisk movement on the back between 
and below the shoulder-blades or 




bones on each side, removing the 
pressure immediately before turning

the body on the side. During the 
whole operation, let one person 
attend solely to the movements of 
the head and of the arm placed 
under it. Whilst the above opera- 
tions are being proceeded with, dry 
the hands and feet, and as soon as 
dry clothing or blankets can be 
procured, strip the body, and cover, 
or gradually reclothe it, but taking 
care not to interfere with the efforts 
to restore breathing. 

Should these efforts not prove 
successful in the course of from two 
to five minutes, proceed to imitate 
breathing by Dr. Silvester's me- 
thod, recommended by the Royal 
Humane Society, as follows : — 
Place the patient on the back 
on a flat surface, inclined a little 
upwards from the feet ; raise and 
support the head and shoulders 
on a small firm cushion or folded 
article of dress placed under the 
shoulder-blades. Draw forward 
the patient's tongue, and keep it 
projecting beyond the lips — an 
elastic band over the tongue and 
under the chin will answer this 
purpose, or a piece of string or 
tape may be tied round them, or 
by raising the lower jaw the teeth 
may be made to retain the tongue 
in that position. Remove all 
tight clothing from above the 
neck and chest, especially the 
braces. To imitate the move- 
ment of breathing : — Standing at 
the patient's head, grasp the arms 
just above the elbows, and draw the 
arms gently and steadily upwards 
above the head, and keep them 
stretched upwards for two seconds. 
(By this means air is drawn into 
the lungs.) Then turn down the 
patient's arms and press them gently 
and firmly for two seconds against 
the sides of the chest. (By this 
means air is pressed out of the 
lungs.) Repeat these measures alter- 
nately, deliberately, and persever- 



ingly, about fifteen times in a 
minute until a spontaneous effort to 
respire is perceived, immediately 
upon which cease to imitate the 
movements of breathing, and pro- 
ceed to induce circulation and 
warmth. 

Treatment after natural Breath- 
ing has been restored. — Commence 
rubbing the limbs upwards, with 
firm, grasping pressure and energy, 
using handkerchiefs, flannels, &c. 
(By this measure the blood is pro- 
pelled along the veins towards the 
heart.) The friction must be con- 




tinued under the blanket or over 
the dry clothing. Promote the 
warmth of the body by the appli- 
cation of hot flannels, bottles, or 
bladders of hot water, heated bricks, 
&c, to the pit of the stomach, the 
armpits, between the thighs, and to 
the soles of the feet. If the patient 
has been carried to a house after 
respiration has been restored, be 
careful to let the air play freely- 
about the room. On the restoration

Accidents y Diseases, and Symptoms. 



of life, a teaspoonful of warm water 
should be given ; and then, if the 
power of swallowing have returned, 
small quantities of wine, warm 
brandy and water, or coffee, should 
be administered. The patient should 
be kept in bed, and a disposition to 
sleep encouraged. 

Appearances which generally 
accompany Death. — Breathing and 
heart's action cease entirely ; the 
eyelids are generally half closed, the 
pupils dilated, the jaws clenched, 
the fingers semi-contracted, the 
tongue approaches to the under 
edges of the lips, and these, as well 
as the nostrils, are covered with a 
frothy mucus. Coldness and pallor 
of surface increases. 

Cautions. — Prevent unnecessary 
crowding of persons round the body, 
especially if in an apartment. Avoid 
rough usage, and do not allow the 
body to remain on the back, unless 
the tongue is secured. Under no 
circumstances hold the body up by 
the feet. On no account place the 
body in a warm bath unless under 
medical direction, and even then 
it should only be employed as a 
Sfiomentary excitant. 

Ear-ache. Symptoms. — Deaf- 
ness, Pain and Noises in the Ear, 
are often produced by the mere 
accumulation of wax in the ear. 

Treatment. — It will generally suf- 
fice to clear out the passage by 
syringing. A large syringe and 
plenty of water should be used. If 
not relieved in this way, the applica- 
tion of repeated mustard plasters 
behind the ears will have a good 
effect. 

Fainting:. Swooning occurs 
generally from sudden shock, or 
from large or sudden loss of blood, 
or any other cause of depression, 
mental or bodily, such as profuse 
diarrhoea and affections of the 
heart. 

Treatment. — The patient should 



be laid flat on a couch or on the 
ground, with the head as low as 
possible; the face should be sprinkled 
or dashed with cold water, free ac- 
cess of fresh air being secured. If 
able to swallow, let some stimulants 
be given, such as a small quantity of 
wine, brandy, or spirits of salvolatile, 
and apply strong smelling salts to 
the nostrils. 

Headache. There are few 
more distressing complaints than a 
severe headache, few more puzzling 
to account for in point of sudden- 
ness and intensity, and in the 
rapidity of their disappearance. A 
" nervous " headache, for instance, 
comes suddenly upon one, and dis- 
ables us from our duties, and may 
perhaps be dispelled, as it were 
magically, by a cup of tea, or a 
spoonful of spirits of salvolatile. 

This, however, is rarely the extent 
of headache. It is not a disease of 
itself essentially, but is the indica- 
tion of some morbid condition, it 
may be only temporary, of the brain 
or of its coverings. As such, it is 
often a persistent symptom, and the 
source of inexpressible suffering, 
more especially if it be the result of 
some structural disease within the 
brain or skull. 

There are, therefore, various kinds 
of headache — the nervous, conges- 
tive, neuralgic, rheumatic, bilious, 
&c. 

The nervous headache, arising 
from various causes of debility, may, 
as already mentioned, be very short- 
lived, and yields readily to stimulants 
and antispasmodics. 

Congestive headache is of a 
character distinct from the pre- 
ceding, as it does not generally 
come on so suddenly, is not ame- 
nable to the same treatment, but 
requires the reverse — viz., purgatives 
and low diet. This form proceeds 
from constipation, from over-use 
and exertion of the brain, 



Accidents, Diseases, and Symptoms.

Bilious headache, or sick headache, 
differs very little either in origin or 
treatment from the preceding, and 
requires similar treatment. 

Neuralgic headache is sometimes 
also much relieved by the external 
application of sedatives. The Bella- 
donna liniment of the British Phar- 
macopoeia applied freely over the 
surface of the forehead, or on the 
back of the neck, frequently gives 
great relief. Care must be taken 
that the skin is entire. It would 
not do, for instance, to apply any 
sedative or narcotic if the skin be 
tender from a blister, or leech- 
bites. 

Indigestion (Dyspepsia). 
Symptoms. — Various kinds of pain 
in the region of the stomach, which 
occur soon after meals. These 
pains are also sometimes felt be- 
tween the shoulders and in the back, 
flatulency causing some distension 
of the bowels ; pain that is called 
" heartburn," nausea, and sometimes 
vomiting, headache, disturbed sleep, 
palpitation of the heart, and other 
sympathetic inconveniences, also 
occur. 

Among the chief causes of this 
disorder of the stomach is the abuse 
of stimulating liquors, or of narcotics 
such as tobacco and opium, the use 
of too highly seasoned or rich food, 
sedentary habits, and want of proper 
exercise. Mere weakness of the 
system, in which the stomach will 
partake, is often a cause of indiges- 
tion. 

Treatment. — The main object in 
the treatment of indigestion is to 
find out what is the cause of the 
disorder. This being done, care 
should be taken to avoid those 
causes, as above-named. Urgent 
symptoms, such as acrid eructa- 
tions, heartburn, flatulency, and 
pain, may be relieved by bicarbo- 
note of soda, or potash, or by j 
carbonate of magnesia, e.g. : — 

H H 



Bica rbonate of soda, 120 grs. 

Tincture of rhubarb, 3 drms. 

Peppermint water, 3 oz. 

Infusion of gentian, to make 6 oz. 
Mix. One tablespoonful after every 
meal, or two tablespoonfuls morn- 
ing and evening, will probably prove 
curative. 

The diet should consist of light 
and easily -digested substances. 
Care should be taken to avoid 
those articles which experience has 
shown the sufferer to be excitants 
of indigestion. 

Splinters, Thorns, &c. 
These should be removed if possible 
by the use of forceps. If they are 
left in they may cause inflammation, 
and the formation of abscesses, or 
gatherings. 

If the foreign body cannot be 
extracted, a linseed-meal or bread- 
poultice should be applied. Matter 
will probably form, and may require 
to be let out by a puncture, in which 
case most probably the thorn or 
splinter will be evacuated at the 
same time. The inflammation will 
begin to subside as soon as this has 
occurred. 

Stings of Insects, <§tc. 
Symptoms. — The stings of wasps 
or ants or bees, as indeed do most 
of the bites of insects, present very 
much the appearance of what are 
called poisoned wounds. The his- 
tory of the case will generally be 
that the patient has suddenly felt a 
very sharp pain in the part affected, 
though, perhaps, he has not noticed 
any unusual appearance about it. 
Within a short, but variable, period, 
there is a feeling of irritation about 
the spot, which rapidly becomes red 
and swollen, and sometimes is 
acutely painful. On close examina- 
tion, it will be found that there is a 
small speck about the centre of the 
inflamed part, and in this the sting 
of the insect is sometimes found. 
The severity of the symptoms will 



4.68 



Accidents, Diseases, and Symptoms. 



of course vary, according to the 
state of health, or the constitution 
of the patient. The inflammation 
may be confined to a small circum- 
scribed spot, or it may spread over 
a whole limb, and be attended with 
signs of prostration. 

Treatment. — If the sting have 
been left in, as it usually is by 
wasps, it should be carefully ex- 
tracted, if it can be got hold of, by 
forceps or tweezers. If there be 
simply a small red irritable spot, it 
will be sufficient to dress it with a 
cold evaporating lotion, such as the 
following : — 

Vinegar, I oz. 

Spirits of wine, i oz. 

Water, 4 oz. Mix. 

This should be kept constantly 
applied, by means of a piece of lint 
or soft linen rag. 

Spirits of salvolatile is also very 
useful for local application in slight 
cases of stings. 

Should however the inflammation 
spread much, poultices of linseed- 
meal should be applied. 

Should the wound have been 
inflicted by a snake or other veno- 
mous insect, and the system be at 
all affected, if the patient seem faint 
or prostrated, stimulants should be 
given freely, thus : — 

Spirits of salvolatile, 1 drm. 

Water, to 1 oz. , 
Every hour, or brandy and water, 
if the ammonia be not at hand. 

If the bite proceed from some 
animal, whose bite is known to be 
of a dangerous nature, nitrate of 
silver should be freely applied to 
the wound as quickly as possible. 

If the wound be on a limb, it 
will be as well to tie a handkerchief 
or other ligature tightly round it 
above the part bitten. 

The venomous effects of certain 
snake bites, as that of the cobra 
di capello, are so rapid in their 
development, that unless speedy or 



immediate aid be rendered, the 
victim will stand but little chance 
of recovery. 

The bite of the adder is occa- 
sionally followed by very serious 
symptoms. The bite, or rather the 
stings, of certain scorpions, are 
often of a severe nature. In nearly 
all cases of snake-bite, the symp- 
toms consist in a fearful state of 
depression, during which, unless 
the strength be supported, the 
patient will sink. 

In India, there is largely used for 
snake bites a substance called Eau 
de Litce, which is a solution of 
ammonia with oil of amber. This 
is given in teaspoonful doses every 
five minutes ; and instances are on 
record in which life has often been 
saved by it. 

If the wound be inflicted on one 
of the limbs, a ligature should be 
very tightly tied round it above the 
wound. 

The object of the treatment, as 
above stated, is to support the 
strength of the patient until the 
poison shall have passed out of the 
system. 

Sunstroke. Symptoms. -These 
resemble the symptoms of conges- 
tion of the brain, and come on 
occasionally with great suddenness 
after exposure to the direct heat of 
the sun. In other cases the symp- 
toms are slower in their approach, 
and in children resemble those of 
affection of the brain from teething. 

Ti eatment. — Apply cold to the 
head, and mustard-plasters to the 
soles of the feet and calves of the 
legs, giving repeated moderate doses 
of stimulants internally at the same 
time. 

Swallowing 1 Foreign 
Bodies. It often happens that 
children swallow money, or other 
hard substances, such as pins, etc. 

In these cases, if the substance 
be completely swallowed, it should

be left to take its course through the 
stomach and intestines. The custom 
of giving purgatives in such cases is 
altogether contrary to physiological 
principles, as the intestinal move- 
ments will more safely carry them 
through than if violently urged by 
physic. 

Vaccination is the only real 
protective we have from the ravages 
of small-pox. This is proved by the 
following facts, among many others : 
In proportion as vaccination impro- 
perly and efficiently performed, so 
the mortality of small-pox is reduced. 
Secondly, by the freedom from in- 
fection which is enjoyed by properly 
re-vaccinated persons in constant 
attendance upon, and actual contact 
with, small-pox patients. There 
has never been a case of small-pox 
among the nurses or the attendants 
at the Small-pox Hospital, High- 
gate, within a period of considerably 
over thirty years. This is simply 
because they are all properly re- 
vaccinated before they enter upon 
their duties. 

We have used the expression, 
" properly vaccinated." It will be 
as well to explain what is intended 
thereby. 

" Properly vaccinated " does not 
only mean to be vaccinated during 
infancy, as the law compels, but it 
also implies re-vaccination, perfor- 
med at the period of puberty — that 
is, on or about fifteen to seventeen 
years of age. 

During, a late severe epidemic of 
small-pox in England (1 870-1 871), it 
has been noticed that no persons 
who have been properly vaccinated 
and re-vaccinated have taken the 
disease. 

There can be no doubt that 
diligent and careful vaccination 
and re-vaccination would in time 
extirpate small-pox. 

Mode ofvacci7iating. — The opera- 
tion of vaccination is simple, but 



so highly important that no care 
bestowed upon its performance is 
thrown away. 

The following instructions will be 
sufficient if carefully followed : — 

Select an arm of a vaccinated 
infant that has good vesicles on the 
eighth day, i.e., the day week on 
which the lymph was inserted. Then 
with a perfectly clean lancet make 
several punctures in the clear part 
of the vesicles, avoiding the red 
border of inflamed skin, so as not 
to draw blood. A clear watery fluid 
will ooze out in beads. 

Take off some of this clear fluid 
on the point of the lancet, and then 
taking the arm of the infant, or 
person to be vaccinated, draw the 
skin tense and insert the point of the 
lancet nearly horizontally into the 
skin to an extent of about one-tenth 
of an inch (-) ; then give the lancet 
a turn round, withdraw it, and press 
it down upon the puncture. Five 
such punctures, to the distance of 
about half an inch apart, should be 
made on one arm. 

The following figures represent the 
characters of the vaccine vesicle : — 





Supposing that an arm with ma- 
ture vesicles should not be available, 
lymph may be procured from any 
vaccine station. It will be received 
in that case, preserved either in 



47° 



Accidents, Diseases, and Symptoms. 



tubes, or on small points of ivory. 
If in tubes, the point at each end of 
one must be broken off, and the 
contained lymph be gently breathed 
on to the point of the lancet and 
inserted as above directed. If the 
lymph have been preserved dry on 
"points," one of these should be 
used for each puncture. Dip the 
point quickly into cold water, and 
shake off any excess of water. The 
object is just sufficiently to moisten 
the lymph, that it will be easily 
scraped off on to the point of the 
lancet, and inserted as before 
directed. 

Some degree of inflammation oc- 
casionally occurs on the vaccinated 
arm. This will generally disappear 
quickly under the application of 
simple water-dressing. 

A slight eruption of small colour- 
less pimples on various parts of the 
body also occasionally follows vacci- 
nation, and disappears in the course 
of a few days. 

To ensure the success of vaccina- 
tion, the infant to be vaccinated 
should be in good health, and free 
from any eruption of the skin, and 
the child from whom the lymph is 
taken should also be in perfectly 
good health. 

With these precautions, there is 
no ground for the fear that other 
diseases than cow-pox will be trans- 
mitted by the operation. Very great 
exaggerations and misrepresenta- 
tions have been put forth on this 
point in order to excite prejudices 
against vaccination. 

One very common source of pre- 
judice exists in the ordinary falla- 
cious reasoning which puts any two 
near things together in relation, as 
cause and effect. For instance, a 
child at about three months of age 
having been vaccinated has (we'll 
say for argument's sake) a skin 
disease break out a few weeks after 
—therefore, says the opponent of 



vaccination, "this irruption is the 
consequence of the vaccination." 

We put another case. A child 
that has not been vaccinated arrives 
at the period of teething, and suffers 
from some skin disease. This is 
a very common thing ; but clearly 
it could not have been caused by 
vaccination. 

The explanation of the fallacy is 
this. Teething often excites a febrile 
disturbance. A febrile disturbance 
may excite into activity any latent 
constitutional tendency to skin, or 
other disease ; vaccination usually 
closely precedes teething — and so 
the disturbance due to teething is 
charged upon the vaccination. 

Re-vaccination. — The primary 
vaccination of infancy, if well and 
thoroughly performed, as shown by 
the existence of several well marked 
cicatrices, affords protection for life 
from severe small-pox — protection 
however, not so complete but that 
modified small-pox shall not occur. 
It is shown by a vast accumulation 
of statistics that there is a greater 
tendency in vaccinated persons to 
take small-pox between the ages of 
fifteen and twenty-five than at all 
other ages put together. It is there- 
fore advisable, in order to obtain 
complete protection, the operation 
of vaccination should be performed 
at puberty, or when growth is 
completed. 

The insertion of lymph by three 
punctures is sufficient for re-vacci- 
nation. 

The lymph from a re- vaccinated 
vesicle should never be used for 
primary vaccination. 

'Wounds, Cuts, Stabs. 
These are of several kinds — e.g., 
incised, contused, lacerated, punc- 
tured — requiring each a modified 
treatment. 

Incised wounds. — These are clean 
cuts or wounds, with smooth defined 
edges. 



Accidents, Diseases, and Symptoms. 



47i 



Contused wounds are wounds 
attended with bruising of the parts, 
such as seen in gunshot wounds. 

Lacerated wounds are pretty much 
the same as bruised wounds — the 
edges are rough and jagged. 

Pzmctured wounds are where the 
orifice of the cut is small but its 
extent deep, such as in stabs. 

Treatment. — Incised wound. — In 
the case of incised wound or clean 
cut, if not large in extent, it will 
heal readily by the edges being 
brought together by means of some 
simple unirritating plaster, such as 
"adhesive plaster," or "isinglass 
plaster," or goldbeaters skin. 

It may be advisable to bring the 
edges of a wound together with 
stitches. The most convenient 
needle for this purpose is a glover's 
needle, and white silk is the best 
material for the sewing. 

If the wound has been inflicted 
by broken glass, &c, the surfaces 
should be carefully searched for 
any fragments or foreign bodies 
before the edges are brought to- 
gether. 

If the bleeding be profuse, the 
wound should be left exposed to the 
air for a while, or the ordinary means 
used to stop the bleeding. 

If the cut be a long one, there 
should be small intervals left be- 
tween the strips of plaster, in order 
to allow blood or other fluids to 
escape. This strapping-plaster need 
not be removed for three or four 
days, unless there be pain and 
throbbing in the wound ; in this 
case they should be loosened, or 
even removed, as these symptoms 
indicate inflammation. If it be 
necessary to remove the strapping 
before union has taken place, the 
wound should then be dressed with 
water and lint covered with oil-silk 
or gutta-percha. 

Scalp wounds. — Cuts on the scalp 
should be carefully cleansed from 



hair, which should also be removed 
for about half an inch around the 
wound. If small the edges can be 
brought together with plaster. If 
the wound be large, it is better 
simply treated with cold water 
dressing. No stitches should be 
put in these wounds unless they 
are very ragged and gaping, as they 
are prone to excite erysipelas in this 
part of the skin. 

Bruised, contused, and lacerated 
wounds. — In consequence of the 
tearing or bruising of the edges of 
a lacerated wound, the vitality of 
those parts is more or less im- 
paired ; hence these wounds do not 
heal as readily as a clean cut. 

In treating a contused wound, 
the surface should first be carefully 
sponged clean of clotted blood, or 
foreign bodies of any kind, such as 
portions of clothing, small shot, 
etc. 

The simple water dressing, or 
wet lint, covered with oil-silk, is 
the most suitable for this kind of 
injury. If the soft parts be much 
torn they may be bound down 
by a roller, and water dressing 
applied. 

After a time, the surface of a 
wound of this kind becomes sluggish 
in its healing, and resembles an 
ulcer. It should then be treated 
with zinc ointment, or yellow basi- 
licon. 

Stabs, or punctured wounds, 
require special treatment, varying 
with their depth, and the part in 
which they occur. 

A slight wound of this sort, not 
penetrating deeply, may be dressed 
with isinglass plaster, adhesive 
plaster, or goldbeater's skin. 

If, however, deeper, but not 
entering a cavity, the simple water 
dressing should be applied, and the 
part wounded be so placed that 
blood may escape freely. For this 
reason it is not advisable to en- 



472 



Accidents, Diseases, and Symptoms. 



deavour to heal a punctured wound 
quickly. 

If the bleeding from the wound 
does not stop from the exposure to 
cold, the wound may be plugged 
with lint or soft linen, soaked in 
tincture of perchloride of iron, 
diluted with an equal quantity of 
water, or with tincture of matico. 
The plugging may be allowed to 
remain in twelve hours. After 
its removal, if the bleeding be 



checked, dress as above directed 
with water. 

A deeply punctured wound is 
prone to heal at the surface ; this 
should be prevented by inserting a 
strip of lint between the lips of the 
wound, so as to allow of the escape 
of matter. The healing from the 
bottom is sometimes to be promoted 
by injecting with a weak solution of 
Condy's fluid (a teaspoonful to a 
pint of water.

POISONING AND ITS TREATMENT. 



SYMPTOMS. — These generally are sudden in their occurrence. As in 
criminal or accidental poisoning the quantity of the poison is usually 
large, the symptoms are both sudden and severe. In criminal poisoning, 
however, as is well known from many notorious instances that have been 
made public, the dose sometimes given is small and continued for a long in- 
terval so as to give the symptoms the characters of disease. Villany often 
succeeds in this attempt, but happily more frequently fails. It is in these 
cases that the true nature of the symptoms becomes difficult of detection, 
and calls for the closest vigilance. The circumstances attending the large 
and clumsy doses of the first mentioned class of cases are for the most 
part so obvious that a little investigation leads to discovery. Another 
feature attends these, that is the suddenness and severity of the attack 
not unfrequently induces a suspicion of poisoning where truly disease 
alone is the cause of death or illness. Further investigation will generally 
lead to a correct conclusion. The symptoms of the most common 
poisons now to be related will be found of assistance in the formation of 
an opinion m either instance. 

Circumstances Modifying Action of Poisons.— There are cer- 
tain conditions of the body which modify the action of poisons. Sleep 
or intoxication for example which retards, or debilitated states of the body 
which accelerate their action. Different diseases also have very different 
influence over the action of poisons, some accelerating and others retard- 
ing them. 

Distinctive Symptoms. — Then again, the symptoms of poisoning 
will generally occur after a meal or medicines have been taken, manifest- 
ing themselves within an hour after the poison has been introduced into 
the system. Strong presumptive evidence of poisoning may also be as- 
sumed when a number of people, who have been partaking of the same food, 
are all seized with similar symptoms. In such a case it is very advisable 
to cause a strict investigation to be made into the articles of food of which 
the sufferers have partaken, and not only this, but all the culinary uten- 
sils, in which the food has been prepared, should also be examined. 

Diseases Resembling Poisoning.— Great caution should, however, 
be observed before arriving at the conclusion that poisons have been ad- 
ministered, and it should be borne in mind that there are many diseases 
the symptoms of which offer a close resemblance to those of poisoning ; 
among these are those particularly affecting the nervous system, such as 
apoplexy, lockjaw, epilepsy, etc. The symptoms of cholera are often very 
sudden, and have been mistaken for those of poisoning, as have also 
colic or perforations, resulting from ulceration of either the stomach 



474 



Poisoning and its Treatment. 



or intestines. The diseases of the heart also frequently cause the sudden 
appearance of alarming symptoms, which, if the existence of disease were 
not suspected, might easily be mistaken for those of poisoning. 

CLASSIFICATION OP POISONS. 

The poisons most commonly met with may be divided into three 
classes — viz., animal, vegetable, and mineral ; of these the two latter ar 
more numerous, or at all events more commonly met with than the 
former. 

ANIMAL POISONS. 



In the first class is poisoning from 
certain shellfish, such as mussels, 
lobsters, etc., the eating of which is 
sometimes followed by an eruption 
of nettle-rash over the whole body, 
which causes it to have a bloated 
swollen appearance, and produces 
difficulty of breathing, accompanied 
with giddiness, nausea, stomach- 
ache, and great thirst. 

Treatment. — If commenced within 
two or three hours after the appear- 
ance of the symptoms, an emetic of 
mustard, salt, and warm water, 
should be given. The emetic should 
be compounded thus : — 

Mustard, I teaspoonful. 

Common salt, I teaspoonful. 

Warm water, a tumblerful. 
Mix, and take as a draught. 



Should, however, a longer time 
have elapsed, purgatives, such as 
a tablespoonful of castor oil, or half 
an ounce of Epsom salts, should be 
administered and repeated until full 
action is obtained. Stimulants, 
such as salvolatile, or aromatic 
spirits of ammonia, and ether, may 
also be administered if there be 
much depression. 

The following form would be a 
useful draught : — Take of 

Nitrous spirits of ether, 30 
minims. 

Spirits of salvolatile, 30 mi- 
nims. 

Water, to make up \\ ounces. 
Repeat the dose every two or three 
hours until the system rallies. 



VEGETABLE POISONS. 



Of these the most commonly met 
with are the aconite or monks- 
hood, belladonna or deadly night- 
shade ; the hellebore, hemlock, 
henbane, foxglove, laburnum, yew, 
colchicum or meadow saffron, and 
mushrooms, all of which are indi- 
genous to this country. Others, 
such as opium, Indian hemp, nux 
vomica, and gamboge, are not 
native here. 

Among vegetable poisons should 
be included oxalic acid, and that most 
deadly of all poisons, prussic acid, 
which is found in undiluted "almond 
flavouring" used for culinary pur- 
Doses. 



Symptoms. — Vegetable poisons 
have many features in common, 
thus they are strongly acrid and 
narcotic, or depressing ; causing 
drowsiness, feebleness of pulse, 
vomiting, purging, and griping. 

Under the following enumeration, 
the symptoms peculiar to each will 
be found, together with their appro- 
priate treatment. 

In order to assist the reader in 
the detection of vegetable poisons, 
we have appended a plate giving 
representations of some of the poi- 
sonous plants most commonly met 
with in temperate climates, and 
which are most likely to be mistaken

for harmless plants by children and 
others. 

Aconite {Monkshood). {See 
Plate.) Symptoms. — A sensation of 
burning, tingling, or numbness, in 
the mouth and throat. Giddiness, 
loss of power to stand firmly, pain 
in the region of the stomach, frothing 
at the mouth, vomiting and purg- 
ing. The pupils are dilated, the 
skin cold and livid, the breathing 
becomes difficult. In some cases 
delirium and paralysis follow. 

Treatment. — An emetic should 
immediately be given, such as a 
mixture of mustard, salt, and warm 
water, thus : — 

Mustard, I teaspoonful. 

Common salt, I teaspoonful. 

Warm water, a tumblerful. 
Or, 

Sulphate of zinc, 20 grains. 

Water, 1 ounce. 
Given every half hour until the 
stomach has been emptied of the poi- 
son. Acidulous fluids, such as vine- 
gar and water, and cordials should 
be given freely. External warmth 
should be kept up by mustard 
plasters, hot water bottles to the 
feet, and friction of the surface. 

Distinction. — The root of this 
plant is often mistaken for horse- 
radish which it closely resembles ; 
therefore great care should be 
taken not to allow the two plants to 
grow in the same garden. The 
leaves and seeds of the plant are 
also poisonous. 

Belladonna {Deadly Night- 
shade). {See Plate.) The leaves, 
berries, stalks — or extract or tincture 
made from these — are most com- 
monly met with as causes of poison. 

Symptoms. — Heat and dryness of 
mouth, a feeling of tightness in the 
throat. Nausea, vomiting, giddi- 
ness, indistinct or double sight, in- 
tense excitement, delirium of a pe- 
culiar kind, the patient twists him- 
seif round and round, butts against 



the wall with his head, and performs 
various other antics. These are 
followed by heaviness and lethargy. 

Treatment. — Begin by giving 
freely a mixture of about one part 
of vinegar to two of water. Then 
cause evacuation of the stomach by 
means of emetics, such as : — 
Mustard, 1 teaspoonful. 
Common salt, 1 ditto. 
Warm water, a tumblerful. 
Taken at a draught. 
Or, 
Sulphate of zinc, 20 grains. 
Water, 1 ounce. 
Dissolved, and taken as a draught. 
Promote vomiting by warm water 
slightly acidulated with vinegar. 

The bowels should be emptied by 
injections of castor oil. 

XJigitalis purpurea {Fox- 
glove). {See Plate.) Symptoms. — 
Vomiting and purging, accompanied 
with severe pain in the stomach. 
This is followed by a state of 
lethargy, during which the patient 
will sleep for hours ; this, again, is 
followed by convulsions. The pupils 
are dilated and insensible to the 
stimulating effect of light, the pulse 
becomes small and irregular ; and 
should the dose have been large, and 
the proper measures not adopted, 
coma or insensibility of a severe 
kind will rapidly set in, and be 
followed by death. 

Treatment. A free use of emetics 
{see under Hemlock) should be pur- 
sued. Drinks containing tannic 
acid, such as strong tea and infusion 
of gall-nuts, should be given, if the 
prostration be great brandy should 
also be given freely. 

All the parts of this plant are 
poisonous ; they owe their poisonous 
properties to an active principle 
called digitalin. This, in combina- 
tion with tannic acid, is rendered 
innocuous ; hence the reason for its 
administration in cases of poison-

Poisoning and its Treatment. 



Gamboge {Cambogia). Symp- 
toms. — Violent vomiting, severe pain 
in the stomach and excessive purg- 
ing, followed by great prostration 
of strength. 

Treat7nent. — Carbonate of potash 
should be given as follows : — 

Carbonate of potash, 20 grains. 

Mucilage, or solution of gum, \ oz. 

Water to make up 1 ounce. 
Mix, and take every hour until the 
purging has stopped. When this is 
the case, and the poison is supposed 
to be evacuated, give the following 
every half hour : — 

Tincture of opium, 10 drops. 

Water, 1 ounce. Mix. 

Gamboge is a gum resin obtained 
from the Garcinia Morella, a native 
of Spain. It is but little used in 
legitimate medicine, on account of 
its violent and uncertain action. 
Quack pills contain it in very va- 
riable quantities. 

Hellebores, the. — The Green 
Hellebore {Helleborus viridis). 

The White Hellebore ( Veratrum 
album). 

The Black Hellebore, or Christ- 
mas rose {Helleborus niger). 

The Foetid Hellebore {Helleborus 
fast id a). 

All of these are powerful poisons, 
the white hellebore especially so. 

Symptoms. — Vomiting, purging, 
giddiness, dilatation of the pupils, 
convulsions, insensibility, great heat 
of the throat, and tightness, with 
severe pain in the stomach. 

Treatment. — Vomiting should be 
' excited by large doses of solution of 
gum and other mucilaginous fluids 
(such as milk, white of egg, etc.), 
and injections of the same materials 
should be thrown up into the bowel. 

Coffee should then be given freely, 
and acidulous fluids and camphor- 
water. 

The roots and leaves of this plant 
are both poisonous, the roots espe- 
cially. 



Hemlock {Conium Maculatum). 
{See Plate.) Sy?nptoms. — This plant 
attacks the muscular power, and 
causes paralysis of the limbs, sick- 
ness, pain in the head, drowsiness, 
and sometimes it so affects the mus- 
cles of respiration as to cause death. 

Treatment. — The stomach should 
be evacuated by some powerful 
emetic, such as the following : — 

Sulphate of zinc, 20 grains. 

Dissolved in water, a wineglassful. 
Or, 
Mustard, 1 teaspoonful. 
Common salt, 1 teaspoonful. 
Warm water, a tumblerful. 

After this, cold water should be 
applied to the head. Vinegar and 
water {see under Deadly Nightshade) 
should be administered. 

The poisonous properties of this 
plant reside in the leaves, which 
somewhat resemble parsley, for 
which they have occasionally been 
mistaken. The seeds and the root 
are also poisonous. 

Henbane {Hyoscyamus). {See 
Plate.) Symptoms. — Vomiting, double 
vision, dilatation of the pupils, sleepi- 
ness, loss of muscular power, a 
peculiarly tremulous motion of the 
limbs, flushing of the countenance, 
heat and weight of head, giddiness, 
fulness of the pulse, and general 
excitement. 

If the dose has been a large one, 
the symptoms will be aggravated, 
there will be loss of speech, delirium, 
coma, coldness of the surface, and 
jerkings of the muscles. 

Treatment. — As soon as possible, 
empty the stomach by emetics, and 
give acidulous drinks ; if, however, 
the poison has entered the system, 
purgatives must be given. 

The seeds are the most poisonous, 
the leaves next, and the roots last. 

Indian Hemp {Cannabis In- 
died). Haschisch. Symptoms. — Much 
the same as those of opium, but are 
of a much more pleasant nature to

the patient, being associated with 
delightful dreams and visions. 

Treatment. — Much the same as in 
the case of poisoning by opium. 

Cases of poisoning by this plant 
are very rarely met with in England. 
In hot climates, however, it is fre- 
quently met with, especially in India. 

laburnum (Cytisus Labur- 
num). Symptoms. — Pain in the 
stomach, followed by vomiting and 
severe convulsions if the dose has 
been a large one. There is also 
shivering, great feebleness, and se- 
vere purging. 

Treatment. — The vomiting should 
be encouraged by mucilage, milk, 
white of egg, flour and water. 

Should the feebleness be very 
great, cordials and brandy should be 
given in repeated small doses. 

The bark and seeds of this plant 
are poisonous, and owe their dele- 
terious properties to an active prin- 
ciple called Cytisine. 

Meadow Saffron (Colchi- 
cum autumnale). Symptoms. — A 
burning pain in the gullet and sto- 
mach, violent vomiting, and some- 
times bilious purging. 

Treatment. — Give some mild 
emetic, thus : — 

Ipecacuanha wine, \ ounce. 

Honey, i tablespoonful. 

Milk, a teacupful. 
Stir up and mix thoroughly, and let 
the patient take it at a draught. 
This should be repeated every quar- 
ter of an hour till vomiting sets in. 
Of course the dose of ipecacuanha 
wine should be smaller for children, 
one-half or one-fourth of the above 
quantity being ample for a child 
under five years old. 

Then give opium as follows (to 
adults only) : — 

Powdered opium, 3 grains. 

Confection of dog rose, sufficient 
to make a small mass with the 
opium. 
Divide this into six pills, and let 



the patient have one every four 
hours, until the symptoms of poison- 
ing abate. 

Or, 

Tincture of opium, 1 fluid drachm. 

Water, to 6 fluid ounces. Mix. 
Two tablespoonfuls to be taken 
every two hours. 

Mushrooms (Fungi). Symt- 
ums. — Pain in the stomach accom- 
panied with vomiting, giddiness, 
drowsiness, dimness of sight, and 
debility. The patient appears to be 
intoxicated. 

Treatment. — This cannot better be 
expressed than in the terse and plain 
terms of Professor Taylor. They 
are : " The free use of emetics and 
castor oil." 

Nux Vomica (Strychnine). 
Symptoms. — An intensely bitter taste 
in the mouth. Tipsy manner, sick- 
ness, headache, jerking of the arms 
and legs, and twitching of the body. 
Lockjaw, great difficulty in breath- 
ing, with intense pain in the chest, 
and a sense of suffocation. 

Treatme7it. — Evacuate the sto- 
mach and bowels. Give vinegar 
(See Deadly Nightshade) and other 
acidulous drinks. If the spasms be 
very severe and constant, and do 
not yield to the emetics, etc., then 
try injections of infusions of tobacco, 
as follows : — 

Tobacco (shag), 30 grains. 

Water, 8 fluid ounces. 
Mix, and allow to stand for half an 
hour, occasionally shaking. Then 
strain, and inject into the bowel in 
the interval of the spasms. 

Strychnia is one of the most deadly 
poisons, a very small quantity being 
capable of killing a strong man. 

Opium : an extract from the 
poppy. (Pap-aver Somnif era.) Symp- 
toms. — Drowsiness, stupor, de- 
lirium, pallid countenance, con- 
tracted pupil, sighing, loud or 
snoring respiration, cold sweats, 
coma, and death. 



478 



Poisoning ana its Treatment. 



Treatment. — Emetics of the sul- 
phate of zinc — (.sunder H emlock) — 
or if the patient be too far gone to 
take these, the stomach-pump should 
be applied {See page 663). The pa- 
tient should on no account be allowed 
to sleep, but his attention should be 
constantly aroused. A good plan is 
to walk the patient rapidly and in- 
cessantly about. A tepid bath is 
useful lor arousing the sleepy ener- 
gies, and cold water should be dashed 
over the head at the same time. 
Opium is the juice of the poppy, 
which runs from incision made in 
the unripe fruit. Its principal pro- 
perties are due to an active principle 
contained in it, which is called mor- 
phia. In cases of overdoses of this 
drug, the same treatment should be 
adopted. 

Oxalic Acid. Symptoms. — If 
the dose be a large one, while it is 
being swallowed a hot burning acid 
taste is experienced, extending 
downwards to the stomach, vomit- 
ing then occurs, or within a few 
minutes. 

There is a severe feeling of tightness 
in the throat, and sometimes delirium. 

When the dose is smaller the pain 
is less, and vomiting does not 
set in so soon. At times there is no 
vomiting, at others it alone causes 
death by causing exhaustion. 

Treatment. — Some chalk and 
water should be immediately ad- 
ministered, and a quantity of water 
drunk to encourage vomiting. 

This is not often administered 
with a criminal intent, the taste is 
too strong; but it is taken some- 
times in mistake for Epsom salts, 
which it somewhat resembles. 

Frussic Acid {Hydrocyanic 
Acid). Symptoms. — Pallid ap- 
pearance, giddiness, great nervous 
prostration, loss of sight more or 
less complete, faintness, laboured 
and hard respiration, loss of power 
of motion. 



Treatment. — The stomach-pump 
should be applied ; or if this is not 
handy, emetics, such as mustard, 
salt and water. {See under Hem- 
lock.) Dash cold water over the 
head and chest. Give salvolatile 
as follows : — 

Spirits of salvolatile, 1 drachm. 

Water to 1 ounce. Mix. 
Every quarter of an hour until there 
are some signs of revival. 

Prussic acid is the most powerful 
poison known. This poison is often 
met with in the essential oil of 
almonds, and great care should 
therefore be taken in the use of this 
pleasant flavouring. 

"Yew {Tarns baccatd). {See 
Plate.) Symptoms. — Professor Taylor 
gives the symptoms of poisoning by 
this plant as follows : — " Convulsions, 
insensibility, coma, dilated pupils, 
pale countenance, small pulse, and 
cold extremities are the most pro- 
minent ; vomiting and purging are 
also observed among the symptoms." 

Treatment. — As in many other 
vegetable, indeed it might safely be 
said in all poisons, vomiting should 
be excited, and this is best done, and 
perhaps in the quickest, safest man- 
ner by an emetic of mustard, salt, 
and water. Should the convulsions 
be very acute, and there be great 
heat of head, cold should be applied. 
If the pulse is very small, and the 
prostration of the patient is great, 
as soon as the stomach is tho- 
roughly emptied, brandy should be 
given. 

It is commonly supposed that the 
leaves of this plant are not poison- 
ous when fresh, but this is erroneous. 
They are at all times poisonous. 
The berries also are very dangerous, 
more especially to children, as they 
have an agreeable taste, and look 
tempting. The danger of the leaves 
is not so much for the human race 
as it is for cattle, who are fond of 
eating them. 



479 



MINERAL POISONS. 



The mineral poisons are perhaps 
those most commonly used for 
criminal or suicidal purposes, and 
they are certainly more easily de- 
tected by chemical means than are 
either the vegetable or animal poi- 
sons. Science has as yet found 
out but few certain tests for the 
vegetable poisons compared with 
the large number of accurate and 
easily available tests for the mineral 
poisons. 

Perhaps the most important of 
this class of poisons is arsenic, as it 
is certainly the most fatal ; others, 
such as antimony, copper, lead, 
mercury, and the acids, are in many 
cases very fatal, but few of these 
possess the power of destroying life 
to anything like the extent that is 
possessed by arsenic. 

Acid, Carbolic. The powerful 
odour of this acid prevents its being 
frequently taken accidentally, but it 
has been taken with suicidal intent. 

Symptoms. — These are much the 
same as the other powerful irritant 
poisons. There is an intense burn- 
ing pain in the mouth and gullet, 
accompanied with a feeling of tight- 
ness in the throat, vomiting of 
shreds of mucus, griping pain in 
the stomach, the lips and insides of 
the cheeks present a charred ap- 
pearance, and if its action be not 
checked, the nervous system suffers 
and the organs of the senses are 
impaired, and death rapidly fol- 
lows. 

Treatment. — Albuminous fluids 
should be given in large doses, such 
as white of egg, flour and water, gruel, 
and milk. Magnesia, and chalk 
and water, is useful in these cases. 
Emetics of mustard should also be 
freely administered. 

Acid, Hydrochloric {Muria- 



tic Acid. Spirits of Salt).— Both 
the symptoms and treatment of a 
case of poisoning by this acid are 
given under Sulphuric Acid. 

Acid, Nitric {Aqua Fortis). 
Symptoms. — {See Sulphuric Acid.) 
The only difference is that nitric 
acid does not cause such a dark 
discoloration of the lips and 
mouth. 

Treatment. — Precisely similar as 
under case of sulphuric acid. 

Acid, Sulphuric {Oil of Vi- 
triol). — This acts as a poison by its 
powerful corrosive powers. It sel- 
dom causes death by its absorption 
into the system, but rather by the 
excessive irritation and inflamma- 
tion which it causes to the lining of 
the mouth, the gullet, and the sto- 
mach. It immediately causes the 
skin to have a charred appearance 
of a whitish hue, which gradually 
becomes darker and browner ; it 
causes pain in the stomach, vomit- 
ing and eructations of a gaseous 
character : great nervous depression, 
which is also shared by the pulse ; 
convulsions, and death. 

Treatment. — Give magnesia and 
water, or lime-water ; or, should 
neither of these be at ha»d, give soap 
and water freely. 

Antimony {Tartar Emetic. 
Butter of Antimony). Symptoms. — 
These are very much the same as 
those of arsenic, with the exception 
that the depression, vomiting, and 
collapse are much more rapid, 
owing to the immediate action of 
the poison on the heart. 

Treatment. — Should the vomiting 

not occur freely, it will be as well to 

give an emetic, and afterwards a 

dose of tannic acid and water, thus; — 

Tannic acid, 10 grains. 

Water, I oz. Mix. 



4 b'o 



Mineral Poisons. 



Or, 

A dose of very strong tea, or 
infusion of gall-nuts mixed with 
magnesia. 

Arsenic {Realgar or Red Ar- 
senic, White Arsenic, Scheele's Green, 
Orpiment, or Yellow Arsenic). 
Symptoms. — An unpleasantly strong- 
metallic taste, a tightness in the 
throat, vomiting of a brown mucous 
character mixed with blood, fainting, 
great thirst, excessive pain in the 
stomach with shivering, purging, 
the stools being very offensive and 
of a dark character, pulse small and 
rapid, great nervous prostration, and 
delirium. 

Arsenic is sometimes administered 
in repeated small doses, and by this 
means is produced a state which is 
called " chronic arsenical poisoning? 
In this case, disorder of the stomach 
and bowels exists, but does not form 
such a prominent symptom as in the 
more acute form of this poisoning. 

There will be redness and smart- 
ing in the eyes, great sensibility of 
the skin, at times accompanied 
either by a rash, which consists of 
minute vesicles or blisters, or else 
by nettle-rash. There is also local 
paralysis— that is to say, paralysis 
of one particular set of muscles, ac- 
companied, or rather preceded by 
numbness and tingling in the fingers 
and toes. The patient loses flesh 
and becomes exhausted, sometimes 
the skin peels off, and loss of hair 
occurs. 

Tr"zt;%e?it. — A substance termed 
hydrated peroxide of iron has been 
strongly vaunted as an antidote to 
arsenic. 

The best way to give it is to mix 
a tablespoonful with water, and give 
every five or ten minutes. Should 
this not be procurable, it is best to 
use the stomach-pump or emetics. 
{See under Hemlock.) 

Large quantities of mucilage should 
be given to drink, or eggs or milk. 



When the worst symptoms have 
subsided, and the patient is out of 
immediate danger, he should be 
kept in bed, with warm poultices 
applied to the pit of the stomach. 
Small pills of one grain of opium 
should be given every four hours 
while pain continues, but no violent 
aperient. 

Arsenic is one of those poisons 
which begun with very small doses, 
and gradually increasing them may 
become almost harmless. 

One form of arsenic (" Scheele's 
green") is largely used as a colouring 
for room papers. In this form it 
often does insidious mischief, as it 
separates from the paper in minute 
particles, and circulates freely in 
the air of the room as dust. This 
fact may be proved by submitting 
some of the dust which collects on 
bookshelves, etc., in a room thus 
ornamented to a few simple chemi- 
cal tests, or by causing some expert 
to analyse it. By so doing the in- 
quirer will often receive satisfactory 
evidence of the existence of this poison 
if he has not previously had some 
practical experience of its effects. 

Copper {Blue Vitriol. Mineral 
Green. Verdigris). Symptoms. — 
These, again, are much the same as 
in arsenic, but rather less acute. It 
may here be stated that many al- 
leged cases of poison by verdigris, 
from cooking vessels, etc., are in 
reality owing to bad or decomposed 
food. 

A poisonous dose of salts of copper 
is always followed (if the patient 
recovers from the first effects) by 
inflammation of the bowels. 

Treatment. — Begin with the sto- 
mach-pump, or an emetic. When 
the stomach has been evacuated, 
give white of egg, flour and water, 
milk. The subsequent inflamma- 
tion of the bowels should be treated 
as described under arsenic.

Lead). Symptoms. — This also causes 
many of the symptoms described 
under arsenic, when taken in a large 
quantity ; but there is a particular 
form of disease called lead colic, 
which particularly affects workers 
in lead {see Colic); these people are 
also subject to a form of paralysis 
(see Paralysis). 

Treatment. — When taken in a 
large dose, give an emetic of sul- 
phate of zinc or copper (see Hem- 
lock). If the pain in the stomach 
be severe, small doses of tincture of 
opium, about 10 minims, should be 
given at short intervals, combined 
with sulphate of magnesia. 

Mercury (Corrosive Sublimate. 
Calomel. White Precipitate). Symp- 
toms. — Intense metallic taste in the 
mouth, pain in the stomach, purging, 
vomiting, etc., in fact, the symptoms 
of nearly all metallic poisons are 
similar. There are, of course, cer 
tain peculiarities belonging to each 
and that belonging to mercury is 
the largely increased flow of saliva, 
commonly called u salivation," which 



almost invariably follows a poisonous 
dose of mercury in any of its forms. 
The period which elapses between 
the taking of the poison and ap- 
pearance of the salivation, varies 
from a few hours to some 
days. 

T?-eatmeut. — An emetic of sul- 
phate of zinc or copper (as under 
Hemlock) should be given in white 
of egg, mixed with milk or water, 
milk, and flour and water in large 
draughts. When the salivation sets 
in, the following will be found use- 
ful when in conjunction with astrin- 
gent gargles : — 

Iodide of potassium, 24 grains. 

Tincture of bark, 1 ounce. 

Water, to 8 ounces. 
Mix, and take two tablespoonfuls 
three times a day. 

A good form of an astringent 
gargle is as follows : — 

Alum, 30 grains. 

Water, to 4 ounces. Mix, and 
use about a tablespoonful as a gargle 
every three or four hours. 



ALKALIES. 



Ammonia. Symptoms. — Pun- 
gent acrid odour, hot taste, stomach- 
ache, followed by convulsions, deli- 
rium, and death. 

Treatment. — Vinegar and water 
in large doses, lemon juice and olive 
oil. 

For any of the other 1 alkalies, soda 
or potash, in their caustic forms, the 
same treatment should be pursued. 

Chloride of Zinc (Sir W. Bur- 
nett's Disinfecting Fluid). — Symp- 
toms. — Pain of a burning kind in the 
throat, nausea and vomiting, griping 
pains in the stomach, pallor and 
coldness, the legs are drawn up, and 
there are appearances of collapse. 



The strong or concentrated pre- 
paration acts with extreme corrosive 
violence on the mouth, gullet, and 
stomach. Should the action of this 
poison be further continued, it will 
be found that it affects the nervous 
system. This will be demonstrated 
by the patient's sight becoming dim, 
and the power of taste and smell 
less acute than it is normally — by 
extreme depression, syncope, and 
death. 

Treatment. — Milk and white ot 
egg should be given freely, and 
emetics of mustard and warm water, 
combined with flour or oatmeal.

ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SICK- 
ROOM, NURSING^ DIET, &c. 



CHAPTER I. 

THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SICK-ROOM. 

THE arrangements of the sick-room require attention, and demand special 
notice. They influence very much the result, and may indeed, where 
faulty, baffle the efforts of medicine. We would lay down the following 
brief rules : — 

1. Fresh, Air. — Secure a free and full change of air without chilling 
the patient. According to the state of the weather have the door or 
window or both open. In the summer time the upper part of the window 
of a sick-room should always be opened ; in cold weather a fire burning 
acts as a suction-pump to draw off the vitiated air of the room, at the 
same time that it diffuses sufficient warmth. To secure purity of air, as 
well as the quiet so necessary for a sick-room, no more persons than 
are required should be in the room. A crowd of people leads to gossiping 
and often exciting talk. 

2. The temperature of a sick-room should, if possible, be maintained 
as near to 6o° as possible. In the winter season, unless great care be 
taken, it will easily fall below this. At other times of the year it is more 
readily overheated. 

In some affections of the respiratory organs there is great advantage 
in cold weather in keeping the air of the room warm and moist by the 
steam from the spout of a kettle. If a piece of tin or lead pipe be attached 
to the spout, the steam can be brought further into the room. This 
plan has the additional advantage of securing a tolerably equable tem- 
perature in the room — an important point in the treatment of croup and 
other inflammatory affections of the chest. 

3. Light. — The light should be so adjusted as to be moderated 
according to the sensibility of the patient. Some persons when ill like a 
dark room. This is more particularly the case when the head is at all 
affected. In delirium a darkened chamber has often a very soothing 
effect. 

The bed should not be so placed that the strong direct light falls upon 
the face of the patient. 

During convalescence, the bright and cheerful light of the sun exerts a 
beneficial restorative influence. 



of the Sick-room, etc. 483 



4. Cleanliness. — A well-known proverb expresses the importance of 
cleanliness ; and if the proverb apply anywhere, it applies still more 
forcibly in the sick-room. 

A common error is that in eruptive fevers the clothes should not be 
changed for fear of exposure of the surface of the body to a chill. 
Nothing can be more mistaken ; the body-linen should not only be 
changed daily, but the bed-linen would also be changed with advantage 
at least every two or three days, and removed from the room as quickly 
as possible. The body should also be washed daily. Children suffering 
from scarlet fever, measles, or typhoid, derive comfort and benefit from 
their bodies being sponged all over daily with warm vinegar and water. 

The washing of utensils, and cleansing operations generally, should 
be carried on as much as possible out of the sick-room, in order to avoid 
the noise and bustle consequent thereon. 

All unnecessary articles of furniture are better out of the room. 

Lotions, Fomentations, etc. — External applications of various kinds 
are of so much use in the treatment of disease that a few directions as to 
their mode of use cannot be misplaced. 

Lotions. — These may be applied simply by frequently washing the 
surface with them. In scarlet fever the sponging with warm vinegar and 
water allays the irritation and heat of surface, and promotes the healthy 
functions of the skin. A more efficient method for an evaporating lotion 
is to soak one or two layers of soft linen or lint with the lotion, and laying 
them on the surface wet them again when they become dry. The drying 
takes place through the heat of the surface — the more rapidly, the higher 
the temperature of the part. An evaporating lotion is readily made by a 
wineglassful of gin or whisky in a pint of cold water. 

Sedative Lotions. — When the lotion is intended to act more by 
its sedative than by its evaporating effects, it will suffice to lay lint oi- 
lmen soaked in it upon the surface, and cover it with oil silk or gutta- 
percha tissue. Spongio-piline is a convenient medium for the application 
of sedative or other than evaporative lotions. Care, however, must be 
taken that it is not put on too wet, or the lotion will drain out and wet the 
clothing or bedding. 

A sedative lotion is made by boiling half a pound of fresh hemlock- 
leaves or half a dozen poppy-heads in three pints of water down to a 
pint and a half. 

Ice. — A greater degree of cold is sometimes required to be applied to 
a small part of the surface, as in the case of a rupture or in fever when 
the headache and heat of the head are extreme. 

A convenient mode of reducing the temperature of a part by ice is to 
pound some small and enclose it in a bladder, taking care first to squeeze 
out the superabundant air, and then to tie the neck of the bladder very 
tightly. The water in the bladder will continue at the temperature of the 
ice until every particle of it is melted. 

Fomentations are of very great value in the relief of pain of internal 
organs and of large joints when inflamed. They are apart of the nurse's 
duties which require promptitude and judgment. If a large joint — a 
knee, for instance — be inflamed, much benefit is derived from swathing 
the joint in flannels wrung out of hot water, and wrapping these again 
in dry outer flannels. Fomentations likewise are of great use in inflamma-

tion of the chest or of the bowels. The hot wet flannels should be put on 
quickly, and changed quickly, about every five minutes, so as to avoid 
exposure to the cold air. They may be continued half an hour or more if 
they do not fatigue the patient. 

Turpentine Stupes are hot fomentations, with spirits of turpentine 
sprinkled on the flannels. These cannot be applied so long as half 
an hour — the heat and pungency of the application is too much to be 
tolerated beyond fifteen or twenty minutes. They may be repeated twice 
a day. 

Wet Sheet. — In fevers with great heat of skin, wrapping the whole 
body in a wet sheet, and then enclosing in a blanket for an hour or more, 
will sometimes cause the skin to break into a profuse perspiration, reduce 
the heat of the skin, and moderate the pulse. In some affections of the 
kidney, attended with dryness of the skin and absence of perspiration, 
the wet sheet has been known to restore the action of the skin and 
relieve the kidneys. The wet sheet is, however, so much a part of the 
hydropathic treatment of disease that it can scarcely be safely or properly 
used apart from the medical supervision with all the means and appliances 
of a hydropathic establishment. 

Poulticiiig. — So common a thing as a poultice might seem beneath 
notice in such a treatise as the present, but some hints may be given 
thereon to the nurse. 

Thus in making a linseed-meal poultice most persons pour hot water 
upon the meal. To make a smooth, firm poultice, however, the reverse 
should be the plan — viz., to stir the meal into the water. 

A poultice should not be too heavy, especially if to be applied on the 
abdomen. It need not be changed oftener than when it gets cold. 

There are various kinds of poultices — e.g., mustard, yeast, carrot, bran, 
charcoal, bread. 

Bread Poultice may be used alone, for most small purposes, such 
as a boil. It will be the basis also of the charcoal and carrot poultices. 

Charcoal, bruised or powdered coarsely, and mixed with bread poultice, 
is useful for absorbing offensive odours. 

Scraped Carrot, mixed with bread-poultice, is used to stimulate a 
sluggish and sloughing or mortifying surface. 

Yeast, mixed with bread-crumb, forms also a good poultice for 
sluggish and offensive ulcers. 

Mustard Poultice, or Sinapism, may be made several ways ; some- 
times equal parts of bread-crumb or flour, and mustard are used, but 
the best way is to make a tolerably thick paste of mustard and water, 
spread it on stiff brown paper, and cover with thin muslin. This poultice 
is stronger, but requires to be kept on the part a less time than the others. 
When removed, the surface is easily cleansed by a soft towel. 

A handy way of making a mustard plaster also is to soak a slice of 
bread in water, and sprinkle it with flour of mustard. A ready and effi- 
cient sinapism is afforded by Rigollot's "mustard leaves." 

Blistei'ing Plaster and Liquid. — Blistering a surface with cantharides 
may be effected in two ways ; one, by the application of the ordinary 
blister plaster, the other by painting with blistering liquid. 

When the plaster is used it is usual to leave it on the skin of an adult 
for eight or ten hours ; when, if it has raised a blister, this is to be cut, 



Management of the Sick-room, etc. 485 

and the fluid having run out, the surface is then to be covered with a 
piece of fine dry wadding or carded wool. This dressing being, left on 
for two or three days, the skin will be found healed underneath. This 
plan is simpler and less painful than dressing with lard or spermaceti 
ointment. 

If desirable to " keep the blister open" — i.e., its surface discharging — it 
may be dressed with savine ointment spread on lint or linen. 

In the cases of young children the blister plaster should not be al- 
lowed to remain longer than two hours, after which period a muslin bagful 
of warm bread-and- water poultice should be laid on, and the blister will 
form under that. After the blister has been cut, the surface can either be 
dressed with continuation of the poultice or with dry wool. 

A warm poultice is a most suitable dressing for blisters, when applied 
for quinsy or other sore throat. 

Blistering Liquid. — As this is intended to be swift in its action it 
should be of the strongest kind that can be purchased. After it has been 
painted on for a few minutes the skin will be seen to turn white ; that is 
a sign that enough has been painted on. In the course of half an hour 
blisters will begin to form. These can be dressed as above directed. 

This mode of raising a blister has many advantages over the plaster- 
ing. It is speedy in its operation, it is cleaner, and it is more manage- 
able for children and persons in a state of delirium. 

For cases of apoplexy or paralysis, where a speedy impression upon 
the nervous centres is desirable, the blistering liquid possesses great ad- 
vantage, as it does also in acute rheumatism, in which affection the pain 
is often quickly relieved by having a strip of the liquid painted round the 
limb near to the swollen joint. 

Counter-Irritation acts by derivation or diversion of a morbid action 
from one part by setting up another equally or more powerful influence 
on the nerves of another part. It places in our hands a very powerful 
means of acting upon diseases of internal organs that are not absolutely 
close to the part acted upon, as well as when applied near to the seat of 
the malady. An example of the latter is afforded by the influence of 
belladonna or aconite on rheumatic or neuralgic pains ; of the former, 
in the beneficial effects produced on the brain by a blister plaster applied 
to the nape of the neck. 

Counter-irritants and External Stimulants. — The following are the 
chief agents of this class mentioned in this essay : — 
Blistering plaster. 

Tincture, liniment, and ointment of iodine. 
Compound camphor liniment and turpentine liniment. 
Soap liniment (opodeldoc). 
Nitrate of silver. 
Basilicon ointment. 
Citrine ointment. 
Belladonna liniment. 

Nitrate of Silver {Lunar Catistic).— Much misapprehension prevails 
as to the properties of "lunar caustic." It is very commonly said 
to be used for " burning " the throat, " burning " off a wart, etc. The 
fact is, that the word " caustic " is here a misnomer. Nitrate of silver 
does not burn or destroy after the manner of a caustic such as pure 



486 Management of the Sick-room, etc. 

potash or quicklime. Applied lightly to the skin, it acts on the surface as 
an astringent or sedative ; entering into chemical combination with the 
outer skin it forms a hard and horny layer, which compresses the part 
beneath it. In this way it acts as an astringent, and allays excitement of 
the minute nerves of the skin, and in this way is useful in sore throats. 
If, however, it be applied in a strong or saturated solution, or rubbed on 
firmly to a moistened surface of skin, it will raise a blister. 

It is by its astringent and sedative action that it becomes so valuable 
a remedy in inflammation of the eyes, in erysipelas and other inflamma- 
tions of the skin and mucous membranes. 

Tincture of Iodine. — Iodine may be applied externally in the form 
of tincture or of ointment. 

Its action in the form of a tincture depends upon the strength of the 
solution. 

As a tincture of ordinary strength, it promotes absorption by the 
moderate degree of stimulation that it possesses. In a stronger form its 
stimulant action will induce blistering, whereas the weaker solution pro- 
duces only a peeling off of the skin. The principal uses of tincture of 
iodine are in chronic inflammation, chronic rheumatism, thickening of 
bone, enlarged tonsils, chilblains. Its use may be suspended for a day or 
two if the skin be cracked. 

Iodine Ointment. — When rubbed in as an ointment, iodine alone, 
or as iodide of potash ointment, has considerable power in procuring the 
decrease of glandular swellings, as in strumous cases, and in goitre. 

Stimulant Liniments, Camphor, etc. — These forms of stimulating the 
surface are of great service in chronic rheumatism and in local pains of 
various kinds. 

The compound camphor liniment, or the turpentine liniment, is either 
of them a strong stimulant. 

Opodeldoc is less powerful, and is well suited for use with sedatives, 
such as laudanum, or belladonna liniment, in neuralgic or rheumatic 
pains. 

Belladonna Liniment is a powerful poison, and requires therefore 
that it should be cautiously used, being rubbed on gently with the 
palm of the hand. It is a means of relieving pain when rubbed on the 
joints in acute rheumatism, but caution must be observed not to apply 
it upon a raw or blistered surface, as it is readily absorbed under those 
circumstances. 

In neuralgic pains, a piece of lint soaked in belladonna liniment and 
laid on to the skin will often give relief. 

Leeching. — When leeches have to be applied, the part should first 
be carefully cleansed and washed over with milk-and-water before they 
are applied. If the leeches are then held in a wineglass or box over the 
part to which they are to be applied, they will readily bite, as they will 
be confined to a limited space. 

For the stanching of leech-bites see Surgical Haemorrhage. 

Care should be taken in applying leeches that they be applied over a 
surface that has bone beneath, so that pressure can be borne in endea- 
vouring to stanch the bleeding. 

The bleeding from leech-bites should, as a rule, be checked or 
stopped as soon as they leave their hold. This is particularly to be 



Management of the Sick-room, etc. 487 



observed with children, as they are prone to bleed a good deal ; indeed, 
so obstinate and difficult to stop are children's leech-bites, that we should 
seldom advise their use. 

The Nurse. — It is not always possible to meet with a well-trained 
nurse, even in a large town, while for those who are likely to consult the 
pages of this book it may be an impossibility to meet with a professed 
nurse of any kind. The hints here given are therefore addressed to those 
who may be compelled to be both nurse and doctor, and who in either 
capacity may be beyond the reach of professional or other aid. 

Cheerfulness and forgetfulness of self are prime requisites in the cha- 
racter of the woman who undertakes the duties of a nurse. Illness makes 
people selfish, therefore it is the more necessary that there should be un- 
selfishness to cope with this weakness. 

A nurse should secure quietness in the sick-room, and should permit 
only cheerful conversation — if possible, not too much of that. In acute 
affections of the brain this is a point of the highest importance. In 
haemoptysis, or " spitting of blood," strict silence must be enjoined upon 
the patient, who should make use of a pencil for questions or answers. 

The nurse should carefully avoid the narration of doleful tales of fear- 
ful cases she has seen or heard of, as these depress the patient and inter- 
fere with recovery. 

Directions for the management of the patient, given by those who 
are responsible for the well-doing of each case, should be strictly attended 
to by the nurse. 

In all severe cases of illness, such as fevers, inflammations, accidents, 
etc., a written memorandum should be kept of each time of taking food, 
wine, medicine, etc., with their precise quantities. Without a check of 
this kind it is very easy to give too much or too little, or to transgress 
directions as to time. 

It need hardly be remarked that sobriety is absolutely indispensable 
in a nurse. This requisite is at once admitted ; but many persons do, 
through false kindness, their very best to banish temperance from the sick- 
room. They will leave wine and spirit bottles open in the room, and 
expect that they shall not be touched. Until nurses in general shall have 
earned a much higher character than is at present the case, it is safer net 
to put temptation in the way. 

Caution in Use of Stimulants. — Another point in reference to this 
same subject may be mentioned. When stimulants are advisable for 
illness, great care must be taken not only that they are judiciously 
administered as to present quantity, but that they are discontinued with 
regard to future consequences, when no longer wanted for immediate 
requirements. 



488 
CHAPTER II. 

BATHS AND BATHING. 

IN infancy, bathing or washing at least twice a day is necessary to pre* 
serve the skin in a healthy condition. In so doing, however, care must 
be taken that the surface of the body be not chilled ; a judicious warmth 
(avoiding too great heat) should be studied. In the early weeks of life the 
body does not readily maintain its own temperature — hence the reason 
that the young of animals remain a certain time constantly near their 
mother. It is the same with our infants ; no warmth is so equable or so 
good for them during the few first days or weeks of life as the warmth of 
their mother, hence also the necessity for a warm bath as the means of 
cleanliness. 

A fallacy lurks in the notion of hardening children. The argument 
in favour of the attempt so to do, drawn from the " state of nature," is 
altogether a dangerous fallacy. All that can really be said in its favour 
is, that it is not possible to kill all the children submitted to the system. 
The delicate ones will be sifted out, and the hardy ones will survive in 
spite of " system." It is an error in reasoning to quote the savage 
state as that of nature, and therefore worthy of imitation. It may be 
urged with greater force that the nature of man's mental endowments 
tends to raise him from the savage to the civilized state. The natural 
state of man is that of civilization, with its attendant fostering care of 
infantile existence. 

Sponge Bath. — In after-life the daily sponge bath contributes greatly 
to the preservation of health, by the promotion of cleanliness and 
by the exhilarating influence in stimulating the circulation of the blood 
on the surface of the body. The warmth of reaction is more sure to 
follow if the bath be used on rising, while the body is still warm, and 
before the surface is chilled by exposure in dressing. In using this, a due 
regard to the feelings should be observed. Some persons are extremely 
sensitive to cold, while others enjoy its reaction and bracing influence. 
The temperature of the water should, therefore, be regulated by the 
climate, weather, and individual susceptibility. 

After sponging, the whole body should be briskly dried with a rough 
towel, and a glow of warmth will follow. 

Cold Bath. (Temperature 50 to 60°) — A cold bath will vary in 
its effects according as it is taken in a small bath, or in a river, the sea, or 
a quantity of water large enough for swimming, and according to the 
temperature of the air. The benefit to be derived from a cold bath is 
governed also pretty much by the state of health of the bather, or on the 
greater or less vigour of the heart's action, and of the circulation in the 
skin. A cold bath should not be taken with a cold skin ; the best prepa- 
ration is the warm glow of exercise. A plunge (head first) into cold water, 
even when hot and perspiring after exercise, and a good swim for a few 
minutes, is more surely followed by healthful reaction than the waiting 
until the body is dry and cool, or perhaps chilled by evaporation of per- 
spiration. A cold bath without the active exercise of swimming should 



Baths and Bathing. 489 



not be prolonged beyond three or four minutes ; even the good swimmer 
must be warned that prolonged action of cold incurs the risk of cramp. 

Persons in impaired state of health should take little more than a 
single immersion, and this should be followed by friction of the surface 
with towels or dry flannels. Such persons should avoid bathing on an 
empty stomach ; it is better not to take a cold bath immediately after a 
meal. 

The answer to questions on the advisability of cold bathing, whether 
in the sea or otherwise, is to be found in the state of the pulse and of the 
skin. With a feeble pulse and a disposition to palpitation of the heart, 
the flow of blood through the skin is sure to be tardy, as compared with 
that of health, and reaction will consequently be slowly established at the 
risk of congestion of internal organs. Hence, in persons disposed towards 
head, or heart, or lung affections, great caution should be exercised. 
Persons who are subject to palpitation of the heart, giddiness, etc., had 
better avoid the cold bath. 

Generally, it may be laid down as a rule that if cold bathing be :.ot 
followed by a glow of warmth on the skin, it should not be repeated. 

About two or three hours after a meal is the best time for cold 
bathing. 

The Tepid Bath (temperature 70° to 8o c ) is suitable for those 
whose health, or sensitiveness to cold, forbids the use of the cold bath. 
The same rules, however, apply, especially as regards the delicate in 
health. 

The Hot Bath (temperature 98 to no°) differs from the cold or tepid 
bath, inasmuch as they are preservative of health, while this is curative 
of disease. 

It opens the pores of the skin, relaxes the muscles, soothes the ner- 
vous system, and (after its first stimulation of the heart's action is past) 
is a valuable agent in reducing fever and inflammatory action by the pro- 
fuse perspiration that it induces — so much so, that it is often an efficacious 
remedy in the treatment of inflammation. 

In the convulsions of infancy, the hot bath, continued from five to ten 
minutes, is an important part of the treatment. 

In order to avoid any possible risk of the sudden immersion in hot 
water, it is a safe plan to have the bath at about 95 to begin with, and 
gradually raise the temperature to ioo°, or even 105 if profuse perspira- 
tion afterwards be desired ; in this case, the bath may be continued by 
an adult twenty minutes or half an hour. On coming out of the bath, 
after rapidly wiping the surface of the body, a warm blanket should be 
wrapped round before getting into a warm bed. 

When it is desirable to give a hot bath to a child for any febrile 
malady, cv in any case where the child would be frightened at being put 
into the water, its fears may be disarmed by covering the bath with a 
blanket, and letting the little patient down gently into the bath. 

Vapour Bath (ioo° to 120 ) is of great use in exciting perspiration 
in catarrh, in simple fever, and in rheumatism. It may be extemporized 
by sitting on a chair enclosed in a blanket, and having a pail of hot 
water placed under the chair, adding to the water some red-hot stones, or 
brick, or iron chain. If a long pipe can be connected with the spout of 
a large kettle, and made to pass within the blanket, it affords a ready 
means of making a vapour bath. 



49° Sleep. 

Hot-air Bath. (Temperature ioo° to 120 .) — This acts in the same 
way as a vapour bath. It is readily made by burning some spirits of 
wine under the canopy of blanket. A convenient mode is, after the 
patient is seated and covered up to the throat with blanket, to place an 
ounce of spirits of wine in a cup, the cup standing in a basin with some 
water, then light the spirit and let it burn out. 

The Tzirkish Bath, a combination of these, is useful in rheumatic 
and other chronic diseases, but requires to be used for medical purposes 
only under medical advice. 

Hydropathy professes the cure of disease by baths of various 
kinds. It can only be properly practised in establishments especially 
devoted thereto. It is expensive, and therefore only within the reach of 
comparatively few. 

CHAPTER III. 

SLEEP. 

No rule can be observed with regard to the proportion of time that should 
be given to sleep. Much depends upon individual habit and disposition. 
The active mind and cheerful disposition that is never more happy than 
when busily employed, and finds its recreation in change of work, will 
generally sleep soundly and be refreshed by six or seven hours' sleep. 
Less than this cannot safely be devoted to sleep by any one who does a 
good day's work, either bodily or mental. There have been those who could 
abridge their hours of sleep to four, three, or even two hours out of the 
twenty-four, but they paid the penalty of such an infringement of nature's 
laws by shortening the number of their days, and embittering them by 
the impairment of health. 

The daily wear and tear of life needs the restoration of sleep to ensure 
the healthy balance of nervous power, and that equanimity of mind so 
desirable in this world's strife and turmoil. 

Shakspeare was alive to the value of sound, healthy sleep when he 
made Caesar say — 

" Let me have men about me that are fat; 

Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights. 

Yond' Cassius has a lean and hungry look; 

He thinks too much ; such men are dangerous." 

Infants and children require more sleep than grown-up persons. In 
fact the early days of infancy are passed in sleeping, to the infant's great 
gain. If otherwise its health soon suffers, and shows the want of " balmy 
sleep." Warmth, sleep, and food are all that are wanted in early infancy. 
For the first three or four years the mid-day " nap" contributes to the 
vigour and activity of the young child. 

Throughout childhood up to youth from twelve to fourteen hours' 
sleep is not an undue allowance. At all events, if less time be ac- 
corded for sleep, " early to bed" is a golden maxim. The practice of 
allowing infants and young children to be awake and up until ten or 
eleven o'clock at night, amid the glare of lights, and perhaps the noise 
and excitement of festivity, is the most injudicious sort of kindness to 
ivhich they can be exposed. 



49i 
CHAPTER IV. 

CLIMATE. 

This word embraces the consideration of many topics which our limits 
forbid our touching upon ; but as the present work will doubtless be read 
in all parts of the world (at least such is our hope), it would be incomplete 
without a few remarks in relation to the causation and treatment of disease. 

The Effects of Change of Climate. — An inhabitant of a temperate 
climate going to a tropical country will suffer from excitement of the nervous 
and vascular systems, by the heat and moisture of the air. The respira- 
tory functions become less active ; while there is a decrease of the ordinary 
action of the kidneys in carrying off the refuse matters of the circulation. 
The consequence of which is that the skin and the liver have an excess 
of work thrown upon them (to speak metaphorically, and also exactly), 
in order to rid the system of certain effete elements which the lungs can- 
not throw off. 

Hence the " seasoning fevers," as they are called, and the disorders of 
the liver, to which Europeans are specially liable on arrival in a hot climate, 
and to which full often they render themselves the more obnoxious by in- 
judicious diet. 

Europeans visiting hot climates should live abstemiously, taking every 
means to promote the functions of the skin by moderate exercise and by 
daily free ablutions. Exposure of the head to the heat of the sun should 
be carefully avoided, as well as the risk of contracting fever by exposure to 
dews, the cold, and the malaria of the night air. Warm clothing should 
be worn at night by new-comers, as the extremes of day and night tem- 
perature in tropical regions often pass through a very wide range. 

The effects of a warm and moist climate upon the inhabitants of colder 
regions, in decreasing the functional activity of the lungs and increasing 
that of the liver and skin, has formed the basis of the recommendation of 
a change from a cold to a warm climate in pulmonary affections. It is, 
however, very doubtful whether the relaxing and enervating influence of the 
heat on the nervous system does not more than counterbalance this func- 
tional compensation. Certainly, when disease in the lungs has advanced 
much, more harm than good generally comes of the migration. On the 
other hand, the tonic and bracing effect of a cold climate more frequently 
checks the advance of consumption if care is taken to protect the surface 
from sudden chills, and so to protect it as to ensure a free circulation of 
the blood in the skin by active out-door exercise. Our British Hippocrates, 
Sydenham, was wont to call horse exercise the " palmarium remedy " for 
consumption, so strongly was he convinced of the importance of out-door 
exercise. A confirmation of this opinion is to be found in the fact that 
coachmen (if temperate men) are among the healthiest classes. In the 
days when locomotion was performed more on horseback than is now the 
case, it was said that "bagmen," or commercial travellers, enjoyed a sin- 
gular freedom from consumption. Unfortunately, however, these men, 
then as now, too often threw away their better heath by their irregularities 
in other directions. 

While the stress of the effects of removal to warm climates upon the 
inhabitants of temperate regions is thus seen to fall upon the liver and 



49 2 Climate. 



skin, the reverse is seen to occur when the natives of hot climates migrate 
to colder countries. The negro, brought direct from Africa to England, 
will almost surely be the victim of consumption. 

Between these extremes there are shades of tolerance of the change, 
which may be acquired by making the change gradually, by an inter- 
mediate residence in regions more temperate but less cold. Dr. Copland 
writes : " The native of Africa who removes immediately to Europe 
seldom lives more than two winters in it ; whereas the negro who has been 
brought to the West Indies, and subsequently to the Southern States of 
North America, previously to his arrival in more northern countries, and 
enjoys necessary food and clothing, will often not suffer materially from the 
change." In these few words lies the secret of protection, to a very great 
extent, from the effects of change of climate— "necessary food and 
clothing." Only the necessary food ; not the excessive and superabun- 
dant supply of the heating and stimulating food that is too frequently in- 
dulged in by Europeans in hot climates. 

An important point to be borne in mind on the question of change 
of climate, is so to time it as to assimilate as much as may be the 
characters of the climate ; to diminish the effects of the extreme diver- 
sity of the regions left or visited ; to go from the cold season of the one 
to the warm season of the other, or the reverse. For an European 
returning after a long residence in a hot climate, it is wise to break the 
change by a short preparatory residence in the warmer parts of Europe — 
such as the south of France or the south-western coast of England. 

The mildness and uniformity of the climate of the southern and 
south-western counties of England render them available for the change 
of air so commonly sought by invalids during the winter months. The 
access of a portion of the gulf stream to our southern and western coasts 
renders them mild, warm, and moist. The amount of rainfall at Pen- 
zance is double that of London. The daily range of the thermometer is 
less ; it rarely falls so low in the night, nor rises so high in the daytime 
as in the midland, northern, and eastern counties. Thus, in the hottest 
summer, when the heat in London is almost intolerable, the temperature 
is moderated by the sea breezes, and is often quite bearable on the coasts 
of our southern counties. 

Without attempting details which would carry us beyond our 
limits, we may briefly state that the more sheltered the situation, and the 
more equable the climate of any place, the better it is adapted for the 
out-of-door exercise so important for pulmonary affections, and beneficial 
for chronic inflammatory complaints, with deficient secretion from the 
mucous surface. The drier atmosphere and more bracing air of exposed 
positions — such as of our eastern and north-eastern coasts — are adapted 
to nervous affections and states of debility, accompanied with profuse dis- 
charges. 

The change of climate must therefore be guided by these several condi- 
tions both of place and person, and may further require to be altered 
according to the changes of the seasons, and according to the special 
character of the season itself. Thus, it not unfrequently happens that 
the south coast of England is not suitable for invalids, even so late as 
June, if easterly winds prevail. The air is then almost as keen as that oi 
the directly eastern coast, and a return inland becomes inevitable. 



Climate. 493 



British and Foreign Cli?nates i?i relation to Disease. — To enable the 
reader to select the climate most suitable to the requirements of the 
particular case he may have in view, we shall enumerate the diseases for 
which change is most frequently sought, and, by the help of the invaluable 
treatise of Sir James Clarke, endeavour to direct his choice. 

Consumption. — In this disease, change of climate, to be productive of real 
benefit, must be tried at a much earlier period than is generally done, as 
it is often delayed a year or two after the period that any good can be 
expected, and the result is that more harm than good is done thereby. 
Hence the trial is often not made through the discredit that arises out of 
its misapplication. It should be borne in mind that consumption is not 
merely a disease of the lungs, but a general morbid constitutional condi- 
tion of which the disease in the lungs is but a manifestation. The early 
treatment must therefore be directed to invigorating the system and 
improving the quality of the blood. With these objects the climates most 
suitable for winter residence are those of our southern coast, Madeira, 
Nice, Pisa, and Rome, with removal during summer months to the 
drier situations of our own islands. 

Chronic bronchitis is an affection that is often mistaken for consump- 
tion, and one which, through its persistence and its debilitating and emacia- 
ting effects, constitutes a veritable decline. The change from a cold and 
moist to a mild and dry air relieves the morbid conditions of the mucous 
surfaces. 

The same climates that are of service in consumption are beneficial in 
chronic bronchitis. When asthma is combined with chronic bronchitis, 
it is also relieved by the same climate as is found useful in chronic con- 
sumption. Torquay and Undercliff, for example, are most adapted to 
irritable states of the mucous membrane without much secretion ; 
Clifton or Brighton for those in which expectoration is profuse and the 
system debilitated ; Rome, Pisa, Madeira, are suited for the latter class of 
cases, Nice to the former. 

Chronic Rheumatism is benefited by residence in a warm climate, 
such as the south-western coasts of England, the south of France, 
Rome, and Pisa. 

Gout also derives benefit by a warm climate. The West India 
islands are especially marked in this respect. 

Dyspepsia and nervous affections connected therewith are aggra- 
vated by a cold and damp atmosphere, and are greatly relieved by 
change to a drier and warmer climate ; but great care in dieting is need- 
ful in order to ensure the full benefit of the change. The use of stimu- 
lants must be very cautiously watched. The nervous symptoms asso- 
ciated with dyspepsia are prone to take on the form of hypochondriasis ; 
the change of climate should therefore be accompanied with change of 
occupation and of amusement. This class of cases rapidly improve 
under change of scene, and the relinquishment of the cares of 'business, 
to say nothing of " throwing physic to the dogs." 



494 
CHAPTER V. 

DIET IN RELATION TO DISEASE. 

In acute diseases the diet should generally be of the simplest and lightest 
kind, such as beef-tea or mutton-broth, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, or gruel, 
with, at the same time, some little respect paid to the palate. 

Due regard, however, must be paid to the general character and con- 
dition of the constitution. For instance, acute disease may occur in a 
very debilitated state of the health, and then may require the addition to 
the above of some alcoholic stimulant. 

The stomach in such cases would not be able to digest solid food. 
The absence of this must be supplied by soups, broths, eggs, etc. 

In the feeding of invalids, even children, some attention may be paid 
to their cravings after particular articles. It will often be found that the 
thing longed for is not injurious, and may be even called for in obedience 
to some indication by nature. The following incident may serve to illus- 
trate this observation. A child of about four or five years old was suffer- 
ing under diphtheria, and had got to refuse the port- wine and beef-tea that 
had been ordered it. It seemed that there was nothing for it but that 
the child must die from starvation and diphtheria together. One day 
she woke up from a nap and saw a glass of ale which was being drunk by 
its mother with her luncheon. This ale the child cried for, but the 
mother feared to allow her to drink. When appealed to the medical 
attendant said, " By all means let the child have it ; and even put it in her 
way that she may take it herself without let or hindrance." The next 
time the child woke up she eagerly clutched at the malt liquor, and drank 
off a tumblerful. From that moment she began to mend, and for the 
next forty-eight hours persistently refused everything else, either as food 
or medicine, and eventually made a good recovery. 

When the disease, though acute, is of a less severe character, and is 
not stamped with extreme debility, the stomach will tolerate light solids, 
such as white fish, fowls, bread, rice, light puddings, and.cme pulpy fruit 
and vegetables may be taken with advantage, as the acid allays thirst. 

In chronic disease a fuller diet is required, comprising meat, with some 
stimulant. 

Milk. — Milk is the most important article of diet in infancy, and is 
also both nutritious and digestible in diseases of adult life. A prejudice 
exists in the minds of many persons to the effect that milk is not easily 
digested. The opinion is, however, at once refuted by the fact that it 
forms the nourishment of infants and of young animals of all kinds. Cow's 
milk, however, is sometimes unsuited to the stomachs of infants brought 
up by hand, or, from its richness in oil and curd, to the stomachs of per- 
sons enfeebled by disease. The best substitute that can be used is asses' 
or goat's milk. The latter, however, is richer than the former. 

Swiss Milk. — Avery good form of milk is the " Swiss" or " Aylesbury" 
milk, which consists of pure milk evaporated clown to a syrup, and 
thickened and preserved with honey. It keeps well in tins, and even 
for a short time after it has been opened. 



Diet in Relation to Disease. 495 

For the first three or four months of an infant's life the best food is 
nurses-milk alone. If for any reason this cannot be given, asses' milk is 
the best substitute. Next to this cow's milk, diluted with an equal pro- 
portion of water in which half a teaspoonful of powdered sugar-of-milk 
has been dissolved. Cow's milk differs from human milk in its excess of 
cream and curd. The cream consists almost wholly of oil globules. The 
addition of a solution of sugar-of-milk reduces it in one direction, and 
raises it in another, to the level of human milk : thus, sugar-of-milk con- 
tains all the saline matters of the milk from which it was made ;* there- 
fore, by its addition (with water) to cow's milk, while the curd and oil are 
diluted, the deficiency of the salts is supplied, and thereby its composition 
is as nearly as possible equalized or assimilated one to the other. 

Most infants will thrive well on this hand-feeding, but there are two 
points of essential importance to its success. One is the giving the food 
with regularity. For the first two or three weeks the child should be fed 
every two hours during the day, and once or twice in the course of the 
night. The interval should gradually be lengthened after the month. 

The same rule as to time should be observed, whatever be the food, 
whether breast-milk or any substitute. 

Feeding-bottles objectionable. — The next point, and one (if possible) 
more important, is that the feeding-bottle should be most scrupulously 
cleaned each time immediately after feeding, or small quantities of 
milk remaining in the tube or teat will become sour. The minutest 
particle of sour milk taken into the stomach with the other will act after 
the manner of a ferment, and favour the turning sour of the whole 
quantity. 

It should, however, here be noted, that it does not follow that because 
when a child vomits its milk it is found curdled, that therefore the 
whole has been sour at the time of taking it. The first step in the 
digestion of the milk is that it is curdled by the gastric juice of the 
stomach, and afterwards dissolved by it. This process, however, is very 
different from the curdling of milk by its having turned sour out of the 
stomach, and it has a very different result in the process of digestion. 

For the reason above-stated the writer entertains a strong objection to 
the use of feeding-bottles with the long india-rubber tubes attached to 
the teat. It is almost an impossibility to wash out the tube after use ; at 
all events, as a matter of fact it too often is only half washed, and -so the 
milk gets turned. 

There is another grave objection to these tubes — they engender and 
foster idleness on the part of the nurse. It is a common practice to put 
an infant into its bed or cradle, with the teat in its mouth and the bottle 
in bed, and there to leave it to suckle itself to sleep ; which it generally 
does, sucking the while even after it has fallen asleep and its bottle is 
emptied. The child goes on sucking at the tube, but getting no food ; the 



* Sugar of milk is made by the evaporation of the wluy of cow's milk to a 
sy rup, and its subsequent crystallization in the same way as sugar candy is made. 
Sugar of milk is chemically different from common sugar, and does not undergo 
the fermentation that the latter does. This furnishes an additional reason for its 
employment. 



4g 6 Diet in Relation to Disease. 

infant, in popular phrase, " sucks in wind." If it does not exactly suck 
the wind, its fruitless sucking at a piece of india-rubber keeps up secre- 
tion of gastric juice in the stomach. This, having no food to act upon, 
icts abnormally on the stomach itself, and sets up various disorders of 
mat organ and of the intestines. Such a mode of nursing is little better 
than the "Gampish" trick of sticking into the child's mouth a raisin in a 
piece of muslin to " keep it quiet." They are alike occasions to the nurse 
to evade the duty of really hand-nursing and carrying the child in arms. 

Beef-tea is the staple of existence in many cases of illness ; it is 
food and physic both in some fevers. It must be most carefully made, 
on Liebig's principles. The heat employed should not exceed 1 50 . A 
thermometer, however, is not commonly at hand, but the meat should be 
cut up small and merely covered with water, in a bottle or jar, in a sauce- 
pan with cold water, near a fire, so as not to allow it to boil, but merely to 
stew for three or four hours. The fat may be separated by allowing it to 
get cold and them skimming it off. Mutton-broth might be made on the 
same plan, and would be more nourishing than that commonly made. 

The principle on which this kind of beef-tea is made is the same as 
that on which Liebig's Extract of Meat should be prepared— viz., that of 
extracting the albuminous and meaty parts without extracting the gelatine, 
which is the least nutritious element of meat. 

In the ordinary way of making beef- tea, by boiling lumps of meat, a 
strong jelly may be formed, and is supposed to show its strength ; but each 
lump is really case-hardened, and the most nourishing part locked up in 
each piece. The explanation is, that flesh consists largely of albumen, 
which coagulates at 150 F. ; therefore the boiling temperature, 21 2° F., 
hardens the outer part at once, and slowly the interior. To give 
a culinary illustration, the best way to cook a boiled joint of meat 
is to put it into water already boiling, and continue boiling the requisite 
time ; the outside is at once hardened, and the gravy is locked up inside. 

Eggs. — For the same reason the white of eggs, which consists wholly 
of albumen, is a most excellent medium of nutriment where, for any reason, 
beef-tea cannot be given. The white of egg stirred into cold or lukewarm 
milk can often be given to children or other patients who refuse beef-tea. 
It is tasteless and colourless, therefore its presence can be disguised ; 
whereas the yolk of egg contains fatty matters with albumen, and is easily 
recognised by the child both from its colour and its flavour. 

Water, either as an ordinary article of diet or a means of allaying 
the thirst in febrile states, requires that great care shall be taken to ensure 
that it shall be free from impurities. 

The most dangerous impurities to which water is obnoxious are 
gaseous matters, and insoluble animal and vegetable matters. 

Gaseous matters and vapours are readily absorbed by water, as is seen 
in the ordinary experience of placing a basin or tub of water in a newly- 
painted room, whereby the smell of the paint is quickly removed. Water, 
by reason of the same property, should never be drunk from a cistern into 
which there is a waste-pipe having a direct communication with a drain 
or reservoir. The poisonous gases arising from the decomposing sewage 
are absorbed by the water, which thus becomes the vehicle for the convey- 
ance of the poison of malignant fevers. 

The decomposing animal and saline matters of sewage also readily

percolate a porous soil ; so that if a well and a cesspool be near one 
another, as is often the case both in town and country, the water becomes 
the channel through which deadly poison is carried. 

Rain water received into leaden cisterns, or water in tanks having 
leaden pipes leading from them, is often contaminated by a portion of that 
metal becoming oxidized and dissolved, producing colic and other signs 
of lead-poisoning. 

For ordinary domestic purposes water is classed as hard or soft. 
The latter is rain water ; the former spring or river water. These vary 
much in their degree of hardness, as may readily be noticed by their 
behaviour with soap. With hard water the soap does not readily make a 
lather, but curdles on the hand. The source of hardness of water is in the 
lime and other salts that are dissolved out of the strata of the earth through 
which it has passed. These may be separated to a considerable extent 
by boiling, or by the addition of small quantities of bicarbonate of soda. 
This is the object of some persons who put a small portion of bicarbonate 
of soda into the teapot when making tea. 

Insoluble impurities can be separated by Lipscomb's filters, or by any 
arrangement by which it is made to pass through fine sand or broken 
charcoal. The charcoal has the property of absorbing gases from water 
and rendering it sweet and' pure. 

Pure water may be obtained by distillation from sea-water, but it is 
always a difficult process, and requires an elaborate apparatus. Nearly 
every large ship has now, we believe, a still for this purpose fitted up be- 
fore going a long voyage. 

In the treatment of disease, water is of primary importance, as it allays 
thirst and fever by diluting the blood and giving the medium by which 
a poison may be eliminated from the system. In fever and in cholera 
thirst is often the one great complaint, and the cry is for water ! water ! 
This indication of nature may safely be followed, and the patient allowed 
to drink as freely as he will. 

Water is the chief of diuretics ; it increases the secretion of urine, and 
promotes thereby the evacuation of effete or irritant matters from the 
blood. 

Farinaceous Foods. — Farinaceous foods should be cautiously given to 
young infants. Neither the secretion of the saliva in the mouth, nor of 
the gastric juice in the stomach, is adapted for their digestion. 

Among the farinaceous foods suitable for young children are baked 
flour, corn flour, biscuit powder, arrowroot, ground rice, &c. It is not 
possible to say in what cases each of these may be most suitable ; what 
may be easily digested by one child may not agree with another, or with 
the same child for long together. 

After five or six months a crust may be given, but should be carefully 
watched. 

When some teeth are cut, the admixture of solids may occasionally 
be permitted ; but even when all the teeth are cut, it is advisable only to 
give meat every other or every third day. Soups, beef tea, &c, may be 
given at other times. 

General Diet. — It is scarcely necessary here to enter upon the diet for 
adults in health, as this will depend very much upon the pursuits and 
upon the inclinations of each. It is well known that those who work hard

can generally eat well without much regard to what is put before them — 
" Hunger is their best sauce." 

It is where little bodily exertion is undergone, and perhaps very little 
brain work either, that the appetite is apt to flag and to require pamper- 
ing : it is in such cases that a diet beyond the plainest and lightest is 
calculated to become the origin of disease. 

It may suffice to offer a few remarks on the digestibility of some 
articles of food as a guide to invalids, and with reference to the diet 
recommended under the several headings of disease in the following 
pages. 

It may be stated generally that beef is less digestible than mutton, 
especially for persons subject to dyspepsia. Beef is more easily digested 
cold than hot by delicate stomachs. Both these meats will require 
upwards of three hours for digestion. Salt beef will demand twice the 
time. Veal, lamb, and young meat generally is not so easy of digestion 
as the meat of animals killed at maturer age. Pork in any form is less 
readily digested than other meats. 

Fowls, Poult?y, Game, though generally regarded as light and 
digestible, are not always so in the cases of the invalid or the convales- 
cent ; they are not wholly digested much under four or five hours. 

Fish 9 especially the white sorts, are easy of digestion, according as 
they are plainly cooked. Salted fish are more slowly digested fish, as 
also are those that are fat, such as salmon. Much, however, depends 
upon the cooking, and of the adjuncts, the sauces, etc. 

Melted butter is usually taken with fish, but is better omitted when 
they are the food of the invalid. Butter when melted, or prepared in 
any way over fire, readily becomes altered in its composition, and yields 
various fatty acids, which are the sources of indigestion. This is more 
especially the case with pastry such as short pie-crust, etc. For the 
delicate stomach, fish cannot be too plainly and simply cooked ; under 
these circumstances they form a light and nutritious diet. 

Shell Fish, including under the term oysters, mussels, whelks, 
lobsters, crabs, are all more or less difficult of digestion, and unsuitable 
for invalids. Oysters are, perhaps, the least open to this objection, but 
they require three or four hours' digestion, and are not the light nourish- 
ment usually supposed, unless very carefully cooked. 

Sweetbread and tripe are easy of digestion, as also are the brains of 
animals. 

Liver and kidneys are the reverse of digestible. 

Ripe Fruits and Vegetables are more easily digested than any of 
the preceding articles ; but then, as they consist of a large proportion 
of water, they are not so nourishing as animal substances. Vegeta- 
rians supplement the deficient nutritive qualities of vegetables by a 
liberal allowance of animal matter in the shape of eggs and milk. 

Cheese, being almost entirely an albuminous substance, contains a 
very large amount of nutriment ; but from this element being combined 
with the fatty acids and some of the oily constituents of milk, it is not 
easily digested by weak stomachs when taken alone. It nevertheless is 
often useful in promoting the digestion of other food, to which it some- 
times acts after the manner of a ferment when taken in small quantities ; 
for instance, after dinner. 



Diet in Relation to Disease. 499 

Sausages, when fresh, are not unwholesome, and they contain a large 
quantity of nourishment in a compact form. 

Alcoholic Stimulants. — The treatment of disease, and more par- 
ticularly of convalescence, can scarcely be conducted without the ad- 
ministration of stimulants ; but it is obvious that it should be accom- 
panied with emphatic caution lest the use grow into the abuse thereof. 
An occasional dose may soon become the habitual dram, unless self- 
denial and self-control be exercised. 

We are not here called upon to follow in the wake of those who feel 
it their duty to expose the errors and weaknesses of their neighbours ; 
suffice it that we admit that in all directions we see a too free indulgence 
in alcoholic stimulation. There can be no two opinions upon that point. 
There is no amount of health or wealth that cannot or will not surely be 
destroyed by any one who determinedly gives himself up to drink. 

As has been said over and over again, it is a mistake to argue against 
the use of anything from its misuse, and so with alcohol. So long as the 
cares and toils of life are what they are, so long will the human frame be 
benefited by the judicious use of alcohol. Common sense and science 
combine to confirm the experience of good and wise men that the mode- 
rate use of alcoholic stimulation is to be regarded as indispensable. 

The extravagant views and unsupported assertions of the " teetotaller''" 
do infinite harm, by substituting artificial restraints for the wholesome 
moral influence of daily practice of self-denial and close watch over in- 
dulgence of the appetites. 

Abundant reasoning could be adduced in refutation of the alleged 
effects of alcohol were this the place to bring them forward. It has been 
repeated as a stock argument by indiscreet advocates of the teetotal 
movement that alcohol is not food, cannot be food under any circum- 
stances or conditions whatever. Experiment, however, contradicts the 
allegation, by showing that alcohol once taken into the animal system is 
never again recovered as alcohol alone, but passes out again like all other 
alimentary substances in various forms of combination as effete refuse — 
e.g., carbonic acid, water, urea, etc., after — as is daily to be seen in the 
case of the inveterate drunkard, who takes nothing else — having served to 
form flesh and blood and diseased structures. Diseased structures re- 
quire a pabulum as well as the healthy structure, true though it be that 
the better nourished the more surely they lead to death. 

The man who cannot be persuaded to sobriety by the instincts of self- 
preservation, or the obligations of social claims, will not likely be deterred 
from intemperance by extravagant assertions of a pseudo-scientific 
character. Better by far is it to inculcate lessons of morality than 
lessons of false science. " The schoolmaster is abroad " now in earnest, 
and we may indulge a confident hope that as education spreads multi- 
tudes will learn to appreciate the virtue of sobriety, without being scared 
by the hideous phantoms of excited imaginations. 

The medicinal uses of stimulants are most found in chronic disease, 
or in acute disease occurring in extremely debilitated states. It is 
grievously to be lamented that the medical recommendation of stimulants 
is not always sufficiently guarded and watched. There has been of late a 
fashion to regard and to teach that all disease proceeds from debility, and 
therefore that it must be treated with alcoholic stimulants. Allowing 

K K 2 



5°° Diet in Relation to Disease. 



(which we do not) that such might be the case, yet the inference that 
alcohol is the remedy is by no means conclusive. A supply of whole- 
some nourishment, with avoidance of the causes of disease, and bodily 
and mental rest, will be surer in their present effects and safer in 
future results. Few medical practitioners can pass many years, or even 
months, without meeting with the melancholy results of intemperance 
that began with the medicinal use of brandy-and-water, champagne, etc. 
The possibility is here referred to simply as a warning to those, who, 
consulting these pages, may feel justified in advising the use of alcoholic 
stimulants as a means of combating disease, lest they forget to look also 
to the discontinuance of their use. 

As regards the dietetic use of alcoholic stimulants, we have only a few 
words to add to the caution already given. 

Malt Liquors are, as a general rule, the most wholesome of 
alcoholic beverages. The alcohol is in them so combined with saccharine 
matter and tonic vegetable principles that it can only be separated by a 
distillation destructive of all other qualities. A small quantity of mild ale 
or porter taken with dinner and supper, or luncheon and dinner, sup- 
ports the strength, and supplies wear and tear. 

Wines resemble malt liquors in that when pure the alcohol is in a 
state of chemical combination that can only be superseded by destructive 
distillation. They have not, however, so much solid matter suspended in 
them as malt liquors. They are for this reason better suited to persons 
of weak digestive powers. The dietetic and the therapeutic uses of wines 
must depend upon their percentage of alcohol, and upon the develop- 
ment in them of certain acids and spirituous combinations termed ethers, 
which constitute what judges of wine call the " bouquet." The propor- 
tion of unfermented sugar also is a point to be considered in selecting 
wine for invalids. Thus, there are sweet and astringent wines, as there 
are ra/and white wines, and there are wines in which the fermentation 
of the sugar is checked and the sparkling or effervescing wine is 
produced. 

Effervescing wines, Champagne and Moselle, are among the most 
valuable wines for medicinal purposes. The free carbonic acid they con- 
tain renders them very serviceable in sickness and vomiting, while the 
alcohol, being in some peculiar state of combination, is more volatile, acts 
as a more rapid stimulant, effects passing off more rapidly than those of 
other and stronger wines. 

Astringent wines, such as Burgundy, Hungarian, Bordeaux, etc., are 
less liable to ferment in the stomach. Port, Madeira, sherry, Marsala, 
are all stronger wines, and are said to be highly brandied, and therefore 
less wholesome for ordinary consumption ; but they are (if moderately 
good) more useful for medicinal purposes than the lighter wines, which 
may be safer for daily use dietetically. In this matter, however, as in 
many others where eating and drinking are concerned, quantity is often a 
more important element in the question than quality. There is, moreover, 
so much in fashion that it is almost impossible to say which wines are 
best. Moderation is the golden rule. 

Spirits, the type of which may be taken to be brandy, are only of 
value as medicinal agents, and for these purposes they are sometimes in- 
valuable—-^., in low fevers, in some inflammations, and in states of 



Disinj action. 5 ° : 



debility, in sickness, and generally as indicated under the several head- 
ings of diseases in the preceding pages. We have no hesitation in affirm- 
ing that raw or diluted raw spirits can never be advantageously used 
merely as ordinary beverages by those who can obtain wholesome malt 
liquor or wines. 

The habit of spirit-drinking (as grog every night) as practised by many 
" very respectable people " in the middle classes, is not one whit morally 
or physically better than the habits of the poor besotted creatures who 
swarm in and out of the London gin palaces. With the moral aspects of 
the habit it may be said that we are not concerned, but of the physical 
aspects we feel morally bound by a solemn responsibility to speak. From 
our own personal observation we would warn all whom it may concern, 
that the " night-cap," as it is miscalled, gradually generates disease of the 
brain, liver, kidneys, with all the horrible train of diseases — delirium, 
paralysis, dropsy, cum multis aliis. 



CHAPTER VI. 

DISINFECTION. 

The following directions, prepared from instructions published by the 
Association of Medical Officers of Health in London, will be found useful 
for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases : — 

" When a person is attacked, one of two things should immediately 
be done. The sick person should either be put into a room, apart 
from others, the room being stripped first of all carpets, curtains, and 
unnecessary furniture, or where this cannot be done, should be sent to 
hospital. 

" When possible, all persons who have not had the disease should be 
sent out of the house to lodge elsewhere. 

" The infectious principle of the disease is given off by the breath, 
and by all the discharges of the sick person ; also from the skin until 
long after apparent recovery, so long indeed as any roughness remains 
upon it. 

"Persons with sore throat, when scarlet fever is about, sometimes 
give scarlet fever to other people. 

" To prevent it coming off by the breath, the mouth, throat, and nose 
should be very frequently washed with a disinfecting solution, such as 
water containing some Condy's fluid or chloride of soda, by gargling, 
swabbing, or syringing. 

" All vessels intended to receive the discharges from the bowels, etc., 
should have a dessert-spoonful of carbolic acid with a little water con- 
stantly kept in them. 

" Rags should be used instead of handkerchiefs for removing or 
wiping away the discharges from the throat or nose, and they should 
then be burned. 

" The air of the room should be kept sweet and disinfected, and pre- 
vented from mixing with the other air of the house. This may be done 



;o2 



Disinfection. 



by constantly keeping up a small fire, or by hanging over the doorway 
an old sheet well sprinkled with carbolic acid, or by both these methods. 

"No unnecessary communication should take place between the 
nurse in the sick-room and the other inmates of the house. Nurses or 
attendants should wear glazed or smooth dresses in preference to rough 
and woollen ones, and should wash their hands before eating. 

"All handkerchiefs, towels, sheets, articles of clothing, etc., should be 
steeped in boiling water containing carbolic acid, or Condy's fluid, or 
chloride of soda (a teaspoonful to the gallon), before they are taken out 
of the sick room. 

" Whenever slops from the sick room are thrown down closets, sinks, 
or drains, a teaspoonful of carbolic acid in a basinful of water should be 
thrown down after them." 

During Recoveiy and Convalescence. — "Warm baths with soap should 
be used repeatedly until all roughness of the skin has disappeared : a 
little carbolic acid added renders the washing more effective for dis- 
infection. 

" Until all roughness of the skin has disappeared, the person should 
not be allowed to mix with the rest of the family, and then only in new 
clothes, or in clothes which have been thoroughly disinfected." 

/;/ the Event of a Fatal Termination. — " The body should not be re- 
moved into another room to spread infection over the house. It is still 
infectious. 

" No articles of bedding or clothing should be removed from the room 
until disinfected as formerly stated. 

"In washing the body, carbolic acid (a dessert-spoonful to the gallon 
of water) should be used. 

" The body should be put into the coffin as soon as possible, with a 
disinfectant. Macdougars powder may be used, sprinkled freely under- 
neath and over the corpse, or rags soaked in strong carbolic acid may be 
laid beneath it and over it (beneath the clothing). The coffin should be 
screwed down and the body buried as sooji as possible" 

Subsequent Disinfection of the House, d^c. — " The infection hangs 
about a room or house for a very long time, and is difficult to dislodge. 
Fumigation by sulphur, however, may be employed by any one, the paper 
being previously wetted with carbolic acid, stripped off, and burned. A 
quarter of a pound of brimstone, broken into small pieces, should be put 
into an iron dish (or a lid of an iron saucepan turned upside down) sup- 
ported by a pair of tongs over a bucket of water. The fireplace and 
outer openings, such as the crevices of the windows, are then to be closed 
by pasting paper over them, and a shovelful of live coals is to be put 
upon the brimstone. The door is then to be quickly shut, the crevices 
pasted up with paper, and the room kept closed for five or six hours. 
Articles of clothing hung up loosely, or left uncovered in the room, are 
fumigated at the same time. 

" After this, a thorough cleaning should be made ; everything that can 
be, washed with a little carbolic acid in the water, and boiled. The room 
should then be lime-washed, and afterwards left unoccupied with the win- 
dows open for a week or a fortnight."

dard Authors, whether they be Poets or Historians, Essayists or Divines, Tra- 
vellers or Philosophers, arranged so as to form half an hour's reading for every 
day of the year. The student finds a taste of every quality, and a specimen of 
every style. Should he grow weary of one author, he can turn to another ; and 
if inclined to be critical, he can weigh the merits of one writer against those of 
his fellow. It gives us a glimpse of the celebrities assembled within its portals. 
At a glance the student can obtain some idea of the subject. Such books are the 
true foundations of that knowledge which renders men celebrated and famous.

Half-Hours of English History. 

Selected and Arranged by Charles Knight. 
A Companion Volume to the "Half-Hours with the Best Authors." 

Contains the Choicest Historical Extracts from upwards of Fifty Standard 
Authors, including Burke, Palgrave, Guizot, Sheridan Knowles, Thierry, H. 
Taylor, Rev. James White, Charles Knight, G. L. Craik, Landor, Hume, Keats, 
Hallam, Southey, Shakspeare, Froissart, Sir Walter Scott, Hall, Barante, Lord 
Bacon, Cavendish, Bisho J Burnet, Rev. H. H. Milman, Wordsworth, Lord 
Macaulay ; with a General Index. 

The articles are chiefly selected so as to afford a succession of graphic parts of 
English History, chronologically arranged, from the consideration that the por- 
tions of history upon which general readers delight to dwell are those which tell 
some story which is complete in itself, or furnish some illustration which has a 
separate as well as a general interest.

ADVICE TO INVALIDS.— If you wish to obtain quiet refreshing sleep, free 
from headache, relief from pain and anguish, to calm and assuage the weary 
achings of protracted disease, invigorate the nervoas media, and regulate the 
circulating systems of the bo ly, you will provide yourselves with that marvellous 
remedy discovered by Dr. J. COLLIS BROWNE, Member of the College of 
Physicians, London, to which he gave the name of CKLOROOYNE, and
