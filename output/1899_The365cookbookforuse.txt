TN THIS BOOK have been gathered a number 
of recipes: some of which are original, the re- 
sult of years of house-keeping experience; many 
old and rare ones are from friends; others have been 
translated from foreign cook books. It is hoped 
that they may prove acceptable and be useful to 
^ many. 

Special attention is asked for the chapter on 
Food for Invalids, as this contains the results of 
considerable research, consultation with competent 
authorities and not a little personal experience. 
To all who have so generously and kindly 
^ given me their valuable recipes, many of them 

treasures heretofore carefully guarded as family 
secrets, I tender my sincere and appreciative 
thanks. 

Mary Shelley Pechin.

SOUPS. 



(GENERAL COMMENT.) 

So much has been written on the subject of soups and 
of their importance or non-importance, that it is not pro- 
posed to discuss these points here. Soup is intended to ^^rc- 
pare for a dinner, therefore, the rich, thick soups, which 
are really a meal in themselves, should be omitted when a 
dinner of several courses is to follow. 

Light, nutritious soups and broths should, however, 
find a frequent place on every table. 

Stock being the basis of all meat soups and sauces, it is 
essential that we should have a proper knowledge of the 
most complete and economical method of extracting from a 
certain quantity of meat the very best possible stock or broth. 

Meat is composed of fibres, fat, gelatine, osmazome and 
albumen. The fibres are inseparable and constitute the 
remains of the meat after long cooking. Fat is dissolved by 
boiling ; gelatine is dissolved and is the basis and most nu- 
tritious portion of the stock ; when it is abundant, the stock 
when cold becomes a jelly. Osmazome is that part of the 
meat which gives flavor and perfume to the stock. When 
meat is roasted the osmazome appears to have a higher per- 
fume, and so when you use the remains of roast meat in 
your soup you have always a finer flavor. Albumen is of 
the nature of the white of eggs. 

Bones ought always to form a large part of the stock. 
They contain gelatine and a fat-like marrow, and by always 
breaking the bones in pieces you obtain better results. 

Beef makes the best stock. Unless fowls are old and 
fat they give but little flavor to soup. Old pigeons make 
an excellent stock. The best stock is obtained from the 
freshest meat. When the meat boiled in the stock-pot is to 
be used as a meat course at dinner or for other meals it is 
best to have it in one piece. The stock-pot should always be 



2 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

kept covered, and the contents should gently simmer, the 
vegetables being removed when tender. The contents of 
the stock-pot should be carefully skimmed and strained, and 
above all, the stock-pot should be absolutely clean. 

ARTICHOKE (JERUSALEM) SOUP. 

Two slices of ham, one-half a head of celery, one turnip, 
one onion, two tablespoonfuls of butter, four pounds of 
artichokes, one pint of boiling milk or one-half cream and 
and one-half milk, one teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, 
two lumps of sugar, three pints of white stock. Cut the 
vegetables and ham into pieces and fry in the soup kettle 
with the butter. Cook these for fifteen minutes, stirring 
them well all the time. Wash and pare the artichokes, cut 
them in pieces and add them with one-half of the stock to 
the other ingredients ; when the vegetables are all tender 
put in the rest of the stock ; stir well, add the seasoning and 
when it has cooked ten minutes mash through a sieve ; now 
return to the kettle and stir in the boiling milk or cream. 
Serve with small pieces of bread fried in butter. 

BOUILLON. 

Four pounds of lean beef, three carrots, three leeks, one 
turnip, one head of celery, one bunch of parsley, one bay 
leaf, one onion with four cloves stuck in it, one garlic clove. 
Cut the beef in pieces, put into six quarts of cold water, 
two tablespoonfuls of salt ; put on to boil, then skim off the 
froth, then let it simmer slowly for an hour; skim all the 
fat off, then add the vegetables not cut in pieces, boil for 
three and one-half hours ; remove the vegetables and meat, 
strain the soup ; when cold take off all the fat and heat the 
soup, strain through a napkin. The fat is excellent for 
frying purposes. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Three pounds of beef, one pound of bone — the shin of 
beef is very good for soup, provided there is enough meat 
on it ; have the bones all cracked. Five quarts of cold 
water, one teaspoonful of salt, two carrots, two onions, in 
which stick two cloves, six leeks, one head of celery, one 
umip. Put on the fire in the soup pot the cold water and 



SOUPS. 3 

the meat and bone ; when the soup boils add one-half tea- 
cup of cold water ; this will accelerate the rising of the 
scum ; skim, repeat this three times, the broth ought then 
to look clear, tlien add the vegetables ; as soon after as the 
soup boils put it on the corner of the stove and let it simmer 
there for four or five hours ; when the vegetables are done 
remove them from the soup. It may be necessary to add a 
little more salt when the soup is served. 

BEEF STOCK. 

One shin of beef cut in pieces, bones and meat ; six 
quarts of water. Fry together one quart of onions and 
three carrots until they are brown, then put them into the 
soup pot and one bunch of parsley, one head of celery, four 
bay leaves, six cloves. Let the soup boil gently at least six 
hours, then strain ; the next day remove all the fat, and 
when the soup is needed heat it, adding vermicelli, barley 
or rice to it ; if vermiceli, soak it in warm water for a few 
minutes ; if barley, it must be cooked slowly for several 
hours in water; rice must be cooked in boiling water; Ital- 
ian paste does not need cooking; put it in the soup when 
served. 

BAKED BEAN SOUP. 

It is always good economy to make a much larger dish 
of baked beans than will be used at one time. Reserve a 
portion of them for to-morrow's salad and put the rest over 
the fire with a quart of water and soup vegetables and 
herbs; simmer an hour and press through a sieve; return 
to the fire, stir in a teaspoonful of flour, wet with milk to 
prevent settling, and dilute the soup to the proper consis- 
tency with hot milk. 

BLACK BEAN SOUP. 

One pint of black beans, soak them over night in three 
quarts of water; boil them three hours with any bones or 
meat you have, or with one pound of lean beef and a slice 
of salt pork ; two onions sliced ; when the beans are very 
soft rub the soup through a sieve, add a little spice and 
cloves, if liked. Cut up one lemon into thin slices and put 
in tureen with three hard-boiled eggs sliced and one gill of 



4 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK, 

port or sherry ; this addition is not necessary ; strain the 
soup into the tureen, stirring well. 

BREAD PANADA SOUP. 

Three pints of water, add three tablespoonfuls of bread 
broken in small pieces, one saltspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful of butter. Put these on a very hot fire and stir 
constantly for twenty minutes. 

Mix together the yolks of four eggs with one teacup 
of cream or milk, one tablespoonful of butter; put the 
boiling soup into the tureen and stir in the yolks, etc., stir- 
ring all the time, and serve at once. 

BAKED SOUP. 

Two pounds of any kind of meat trimmings or odd 
pieces, two onions, two carrots, two ounces of rice, one 
pint of split peas, four quarts of cold water, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a little pepper. Cut the meat and vegetables in 
pieces, add the rice and peas, season with the salt and pep- 
per ; put all into a jar, fill in with the water, cover closely 
and bake for four hours, then strain and serve. 

This soup is very good and wholesome, and can be 
made in the oven when the top of the stove is occupied. 

BISQUE OF CLAMS. 

Take thirty clams, boil them in their own juice for five 
minutes, drain and chop them very fine. Put into the 
saucepan four ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, one- 
half saltspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, a 
little cayenne, one pint of milk ; stir constantly, and just 
before the mixture boils move from the fire, strain and heat 
again ; the butter and flour must be quite smoothly blended 
before the milk and other ingredients are added. 

• A QUICK BROTH. 

One pound of lean beef cut in fine pieces and some 
chicken bones well broken up ; add one quart of cold water, 
one carrot, one onion, a little celery and one saltspoonful of 
salt. Boil gently together for one hour, strain and serve 
with toasted bread. 



SOUPS. 5 

BROWN SOUP STOCK. 

Six pounds of beef from the shin (tiiree pounds of meat 
and three pounds of bone), six quarts of cold water, one- 
half teaspoonful of pepper-corns, six cloves, one bay leaf, 
three sprigs of parsley, three of thyme, three of sweet mar- 
joram, one carrot, one turnip, one large onion, two stalks 
of celery, all cut fine ; one tablespoonful of salt. Wipe the 
meat with a clean, damp cloth— never wash meat for soup ; 
cut the meat into small pieces, break up the bones ; fry one- 
third of the meat with the marrow from the bones ; put the 
rest of the meat with the bones into the soup kettle, add 
the water, let it stand one-half hour, then add the fried 
meat and cook all slowly, never boiling, only simmering, 
for six hours. Cover the soup tightly. One and one-half 
hours before finishing the soup, add the vegetables, then 
strain and cool quickly. The next day remove the fat before 
using the stock, 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Take one-half of an old chicken, remove the fat and 
skin, break up and pound the meat and bones ; then place all 
in a stew-pan and add one quart of cold water with one table- 
spoonful of cut leeks or one small onion, twenty blanched 
and peeled almonds, one blade of mace, and a saltspoonful 
of salt. Stir the broth until it boils, then skim carefully; 
after that remove from the hot fire to the cooler part of the 
stove and let the broth simmer for two hours, strain the 
broth and put away to cool, unless it is desired at once. 
Serve with slices of hot toast. 

CELERY SOUP. 

Take one quart of good stock either made from veal or 
the water in which chickens have been boiled ; put on the 
fire one-half cupful of rice and one pint of milk and grate 
into this the white part and the root of two heads of celery ; 
let the rice cook slowly, add more milk if the rice becomes 
too stiff ; when it is tender mash it through a colander and 
add to the stock, with one teaspoonful of salt, a little white 
pepper, a pinch of cayenne and let all boil up once. Serve 
in hot tureen. 



6 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CLAM SOUP. 

One shin of veal, cut into pieces, one bunch of herbs, 
three quarts of water, cook for three hours, skim carefully, 
strain and then put back into soup kettle, add fifty clams 
chopped fine one quarter of an hour before serving, with 
four large crackers grated. 

CLARET SOUP. 

One quart of boiling water; soak one cup of sago in a 
little cold water for a few hours ; add to the boiling water, 
one-half cup of sugar ; boil together ; add one lemon sliced 
very thin ; just before serving put one stick of cinnamon in 
one pint of claret, and boil for two minutes. Serve hot. 

CORN SOUP. 

One quart of water, six ears of corn, cut oft' the kernels 
and scrape the cob well ; boil the corn in the water one and 
one-half hours, then mash through the colander. Take 
butter the size of an egg, put into the frying pan with one 
tablespoonful of flour, stir until smooth, but not brown, then 
add one pint of sweet milk ; add to the corn and boil up 
once. 

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP. 

Two large heads of celery, cut very fine, put on to boil 
in one quart of milk and add one cup of rice, cook slowly; 
when the celery is tender and the rice cooked, rub them 
through a coarse sieve ; return to the soup kettle, add a little 
more milk if too thick and then add one quart of good veal 
or chicken broth, a little salt and pepper. 

CONSOMME ROYAL. 

Four pounds of beef cut in pieces and one chicken 
which has been half roasted and cut in pieces. Put four 
quarts of cold water into the soup kettle, add the beef and 
one ounce of salt ; as soon as it boils, skim, add the chicken, 
one carrot, one turnip, one leek, one onion with four cloves 
stuck in it, one bay leaf. Boil all slowly for four hours, 
then strain, put back into the kettle with the white of one 
egg beaten stifi" and let it all boil up once more, then strain 



SOUPS. 7 

again. Serve with royal custard. To make this, take two 
yolks of eggs, and one whole egg, a little pepper and salt, 
one-fourth of a pint of milk, one-fourth pint of the con- 
somme, mix well together. Butter a small cup or mold, fill 
with the custard, bake slowly for a few minutes or until the 
custard is solid ; when cold, cut into small dice and serve in 
the soup. 

CRECY SOUP. 

Slice one pound of carrots, put into the stew-pan, one- 
half pound of butter, when hot, fry the carrots, four leeks 
cut fine, one onion sliced, together for five minutes, then 
add one quart of good chicken broth and one-fourth pound 
of breadcrumbs; simmer until the carrots are done, then 
press all through a fine sieve, then return to the soup pot 
and add two quarts of chicken broth, stir well until it boils, 
then simmer for one hour, skim off all the fat and strain, 
serve in a tureen. Serve with fried bread, cut in small dice 
pieces. 

PUREE OF CAULIFLOWER. 

Put one small cauliflower in three pints of white stock, 
boil for thirty minutes. Stir two tablespoonfuls of flour 
well mixed with one tablespoonful of butter into this, and 
then boil ten minutes. Press through a sieve, add one cup 
of cream and let all just boil up ; put into the well heated 
tureen one and one-half cups of whipped cream ; pour over 
the soup ; serve hot ; add salt and pepper when first cream 
is added. 

COLORING FOR SOUPS— i. 

One cup of brown sugar, one-half dozen whole cloves, 
one cup hot water ; let them all boil until the liquid is quite 
dark brown in color, then bottle it. Add a teaspoonful to 
any soup, you desire to darken in color. 

COLORING FOR SOUPS— 2. 

Take onions and cut them in slices and put them into 
a moderate oven, leave until they are black chips (not 
burnt). These may be bottled and are by some considered 
far better for coloring soups and gravies than burnt sugar.

FISH CHOWDER. 

Put half a pound of sliced salt pork in the bottom of a 
saucepan and fry brown ; take it out, and put in layers of 
potatoes, onions and fish sliced, seasoning each layer with 
plenty of salt and pepper, using about three pounds of fish, 
and a quart each of potatoes and onions, cover with cold 
water, bring gradually to a boil, and cook slowly for thirty 
minutes; then add two pounds of sea-biscuit soaked for 
five minutes in warm water, and boil five minutes longer 
and serve. 

FISH SOUP. 

Put into the frying-pan one-half pound of butter, four 
carrots cut fine, three onions sliced, two heads of celery cut 
fine, two shallots cut fine or one clove of garlic, three 
cloves, one bay leaf, one little bunch of thyme and parsley ; 
fry all these until they are brown ; then add one pint of 
white wine and three quarts of boiling water, one teas- 
spoonful of salt, and one saltspoonful of pepper ; put with 
these six pounds of any good fish, let all simmer for two 
hours ; when finished, strain through a cloth ; serve hot. 

MARYLAND CHOWDER. 

There is nothing better for a chowder than a large cod 
or haddock. Two pounds of fish, one-half pound of water 
crackers, two ounces of butter, one pint of oysters or clams, 
one gill of cream, one gill of water, one onion sliced, one 
tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one- 
half teaspoonful of mace, one-third teaspoonful of cayenne. 
Put the water into the soup kettle, then the onion, one- 
half the fish, the skin side down; sprinkle in one-half the 
salt and pepper, etc., then one half of the oysters or clams, 
cover all with the butter in small lumps and one-half of the 
crackers ; the rest of the fish, oysters, seasoning, butter and 
crackers; pour over the cream having first boiled it. If 
the oysters have much liquor, you do not need the water ; if 
the chowder is too dry add a little more water, cover closely 
and cook one-half hour, serve on a platter; milk maybe 
used instead of cream. One-half pound of bacon or salt 
pork gives a good flavor. To be eaten on plates with a 
fork, not as a soup. 



SOUPS. 9 

FLEMISH SOUP. 

One dozen sliced potatoes, two heads of celery, two 
onions, four pounds of shin of beef, four quarts of water, 
salt, pepper ; boil together three hours, then add one-half 
pint of boiling milk or hot cream and one teaspoonful of 
sugar. 

GLAZE. 

This is one of the most valuable aids to good cooking — 
it will keep for years. It is not always possible to have 
stock in the house at all times, especially in summer — with 
glaze one does not need to have it. 

Take six pounds of lean beef, the leg is the best ; part 
of a knuckle of veal, with the beef to weigh six pounds; 
cut all into small pieces with one-half a pound of lean ham ; 
do not let any of the outside of the ham go in the pot. Put 
these into the soup with five quarts of water, three onions 
with two cloves stuck in each, one carrot and one head of 
celery; let all come to the boiling point, then skim, then 
place on the back of the range and let it simmer for six 
hours — it is now an excellent foundation for clear soups or 
gravies by adding one teaspoonful of salt, but do not add 
any salt, if it is intended to reduce to glaze ; just strain the 
stock through the colander, place in an earthern crock, 
put back the meat and vegetables with four quarts of boil- 
ing water and boil all four hours longer, then strain and 
place in another crock or bowl ; next morning, take the two 
stocks, heat them and strain again, then unite them in one 
large pot and let it boil as fast as possible, be sure not to 
cover it ; when it is reduced to three pints, then put it into 
a smaller pot and boil until it is thick and of a brown color ; 
be very watchful that it does not burn, as this is the 
dangerous time. When you have only a little over a pint, 
pour it into small jars or into sausage skins which have 
been well cleansed, or it can be poured on to tins and dried 
by exposure until it is dry ; if put into jars do not cover 
them until the glaze leaves the sides of the jar. To put the 
glaze into the sausage skins, tie one end very tight and pour 
the glaze through a funnel, into the skin, tie up the other end 
and hang it to dry ; when the glaze is needed cut a slice oflF 
this.

CHICKEN GUMBO. 

Put two slices of fat, salt pork and one tablespoonful of 
butter into the frying-pan. When hot put in one chicken 
which has been cut into pieces. Fry these brown, and then 
put them into the soup kettle with one pint of tomatoes, one 
pint of okra sliced, one onion sliced, onesaltspoonful of salt 
and two quarts of cold water ; cook together for four hours 
very slowly — the soup must not boil, only simmer — when de- 
sired, take out the chicken, cut all the white meat into small 
dice, and return to the soup ; let all come to the boiling 
point and serve. Serve with the soup, boiled rice. 

GAME SOUP. 

Take the bones and trimmings of any cold game, break 
into small pieces and put into the soup kettle ; add two 
quarts of stock (if you have it) or else cold water ; one car- 
rot, one onion, one small turnip, one head of celery all cut 
in small pieces. Let the soup boil, skim and place on the 
back of the stove to simmer for three hours, then strain 
and remove the fat. Boil two tablespoonfuls of barley 
until soft, take one half and mix with it the yolks of 
three hard-boiled eggs inoistened with one tablespoonful of 
cream, and then stir it into the soup, slowly ; put in the bal- 
ance of the barley and serve. 

CALF'S HEAD OR MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

Take the water in which the head was boiled, two pounds 
of veal, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of chopped carrots, 
one turnip cut fine, three stalks of celery, one blade of mace, 
four cloves, twenty pepper-corns, one bay leaf, a little pars- 
ley. Put all the vegetables into a pan and fry them with 
two tablespoonfuls of butter until they are brown ; put them 
with the stock and veal ; cook slowly for one hour, strain 
the soup, return to the kettle, and add two lemons cut in 
slices, one glass of sherry or port, some salt and pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed to a soft paste with a 
little water, one tablespoonful of tomato catsup, some egg 
and force-meat balls. Serve. 

Any of the soup left is equally good re-heated the next 
day. 



SOUPS. II 



MUTTON SOUP. 



Take the neck of mutton, cut it in pieces, add to it three 
carrots, two turnips, two onions, all sliced, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, one tablespoonful of parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, 
a little pepper and three pints of cold water ; simmer slowly 
for four or five hours, then skim ; pass the soup through the 
sieve and return to the soup kettle to boil just once. Serve 
with barley which has been boiled separately while the soup 
has been cooking. 

MINESTRONE. 

A FAVORITE ITALIAN THICK SOUP. 

Three quarts of boiling water well salted, one piece of 
salt pork the size of an egg ; one large clove of garlic ; chop 
the garlic fine with the pork ; this is absolutely essential ; 
one handful of lima beans, one-half a carrot, one-half a 
small turnip, both chopped fine ; add these to the water and 
boil for twenty minutes, then add two large tomatoes 
(stewed and strained), two potatoes chopped fine, one ear 
of corn, the kernels cut off ; one-half a medium sized cab- 
bage — use pieces of the leaves as large as your hand, but 
remove the thick stem, one-half a pint of rice; boil slowly, 
covered, one-half an hour or until the rice and cabbage are 
done, no longer, as the cabbage becomes watery if cooked 
too much. 

NORMANDY SOUP. 

One knuckle of veal, one quart of white button onions, 
four quarts of cold water, half a loaf of bread, one quart of 
cream, two tablespoonfuls of butter, salt and pepper to 
taste, two tablespoonfuls of flour. Put veal in the soup 
kettle with onions and water, let all simmer slowly for two 
hours ; then add the bread cut in slices. Simmer slowly for 
two hours more. Remove the knuckle and press the ingre- 
dients through a sieve. Rub butter and flour together to a 
smooth paste, stir into the boiling soup, and stir constantly 
until it thickens. Add the cream, salt and pepper, and 
serve. 



12 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

ONION SOUP. 

Fry six large onions in some butter or good dripping un- 
til they are brown, then stir in with the onions one table- 
spoonful of flour, then add one quart of hot water ; stew the 
onions till tender; add one teaspoonful of salt and one tea- 
spoonful of sugar ; when the onions are done, strain the soup 
into a hot tureen and stir quickly into it the yolks of two 
eggs in which put one tablespoonful of cream. Put into 
the soup tureen two slices of hot toast before pouring in the 
soup. 

BAKED ONION SOUP. 

Place in a dish which will stand the heat, some slices of 
bread with the crusts left on. Fry three onions in a pan 
with one tablespoonful of butter until brown, put these on 
the bread, and then fill up the dish with some good con- 
somme or stock ; sprinkle on the top some grated cheese, 
cover the dish and let the soup bake in the oven for ten 
minutes; the soup is really better served in the same dish. 
If this is not liked, be sure the tureen is hot before the soup 
is poured into it, aud that it is served at once. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

Two ox tails, two slices of ham, one tablespoonful of 
butter, two carrots, three onions, one leek, one head of 
celery, one bunch of sweet herbs, one bay leaf, twelve 
pepper-corns, four cloves, one teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one glass of port wine, 
three quarts of water. Cut up the tails, wash them well in 
cold water, put them in the soup kettle with the butter ; cut 
the vegetables in slices, add them with the herbs and pepper- 
corns, add one-half pint of water; stir and cook these well 
together for ten minutes, then fill up the stew-pan with the 
water, and when boiling, skim well and add the salt; sim- 
mer gently for four hours or until the ox tails are tender, 
then take them out of the soup, strain it, thicken with a 
little flour, add the wine and catsup, put back the tails, sim- 
mer for ten minutes and serve. 

A dish of boiled rice, boiled dry, is very nice to serve 
with the soup,

OYSTER CHOWDER. 



Two slices of salt pork cut fine, one onion sliced, one 
pint of oysters, one pint of sliced potatoes, one quart of 
rich milk, one-half cup of fine cracker crumbs, a little salt

Cook the potatoes until they are tender ; fry the onion 
and salt pork until they begin to color, strain them into the 
oysters ; cook the oysters in their own liquor until they are 
plump, add the potatoes, cracker crumbs, and last of all the 
milk. Keep it hot, and stand for one-half hour where it 
will not cook, to ripen— this chowder depends on two 
things— the richness of the milk, and the ripening process. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

One quart of oysters, one quart of milk, one-half pint 
of cream, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one dessertspoonful 
of flour. 

Put into the stew-pan the oysters in their own liquor,

salt and pepper and one tablespoonful of butter. Let these 
all come to boiling point. Serve hot, with toasted crackers. 

DRIED PEA SOUP.

morning place them in the soup pot with two quarts of 
water, with just a little bit of soda, add one carrot cut fine, 
one turnip cut in pieces, one onion sliced, one head of celery 
cut fine; when the vegetables are tender add one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, one teaspoon- 
ful of sugar. Strain the soup through a colander, rubbing 
the vegetables well, then return to the soup pot, and keep

with one-half teacup of cream, stir in quickly, and serve 
with fried bread cut in small cubes. 

PUMPKIN SOUP. 
Two pounds of yellow pumpkin, take off the rind and 
remove the seeds, cut into small pieces ; put into the stew- 
pan with one tablespoonful of sugar, a little salt and one 
pint of boiling water ; simmer together until the pumpkin 
is tender, then drain and mash through a colander ; put back 
into the stew-pan, add one quart of boiling hot milk, boil

dessertspoonful of flour and one tablespoonful of cream so 
as to make a thick cream, add one tablespoonful of grated 
cheese, a little salt, pepper and nutmeg ; beat the mixture 
until it is smooth and firm, and leaves the sides of the 
saucepan. Mold into quenelles with a teaspoon dipped in 
hot water ; when needed, poach them in hot stock or water 
and serve in the tureen. 

RICE AND TOMATO SOUP. 
Five cups of brown soup stock ; cook in this, one-half 
cup of rice until it is tender. Cook together one bay leaf, 
two cups of strained and stewed tomatoes, two slices of 
onion, ten peppercorns, two stalks of celery cut fine ; cook 
for one-half hour, then strain into the stock, add one table- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce ; rub together one-half 
tablespoonful of butter and one and one-half tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch ; stir this into the soup and cook for fifteen 
minutes, add one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, and 
serve hot. 



15 



SOUP A LA REINE. 



One chicken, one ounce of sweet almonds, one cup of 
bread crumbs, one-half pint of cream, one lump of sugar, 
two quarts of good veal stock. Boil the chicken until it is 
tender, then remove from the soup kettle, pull off the meat 
from the bones, pound it with the almonds in the mortar; 
when smooth, return to the soup kettle with the bread 
crumbs and let all simmer for one hour, then rub through 
the sieve, add the sugar, a little salt, and the cream ; take 
the crust of the loaf and place in the tureen ; pour over the 
soup. 

CREAM OF SPINACH. 

Wash and pick the spinach and put it on to boil ; boil 
until soft and tender, then press enough through a sieve to 
make a generous pint of the pulp, add to this one quart of 
rich chicken or any good, white stock ; when it becomes 
very hot, take one tablespoonful of butter and two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch and rub together until smooth, 
stir this into the soup and continue to stir until very smooth. 
Season with salt and white pepper ; return to the soup pot 
and add a cup of cream, beat all the time after the cream is 
added with an egg-whip — this you will find makes it very 
light. Serve immediately ; it should be very hot. 

Cream of Asparagus, Cream of Celery, Cream of Beets, 
Cream of Corn, Cream of Lettuce, and Cream of Green Peas 
are all made in the same manner. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil one can of tomatoes or four large raw ones in one 
quart of boiling water for twenty minutes, then add one 
pint of sweet milk, a pinch of soda, one teaspoonful of salt, 
a little pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of butter ; let the 
mixture come to boiling point, then strain and add eight 
small crackers, rolled fine. 

TOMATO-CREAM SOUP.

l6 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

and add one pint of whipped cream. Stir together and 
serve at once. 

TAPIOCA SOUP. 
Boil three pints of broth with two tablespoonfuls of 
tapioca, when well mixed cover the stew-pan and let the 
soup simmer for a half hour, then skim and serve. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 
One quart of good stock, two carrots cut fine, two 
onions cut fine, one potato cut fine, one turnip cut fine, one 
bunch of parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper. 
Cook the vegetables in the stock until tender, and then 
serve all together. The stock can be omitted and water 
substituted. Vegetable soups, clear and thick, are extremely 
palatable ; the former being agreeable and wholesome, 
especially in warm weather, when fresh vegetables are 
abundant and full of juice and fragrance, and the latter, or 
thick soup may be very nutritious also. Nutritious and 
palatable soup may be made from fish of the cheaper sorts, 
using fish in place of meat for the stock. 

VEAL OR MUTTON BROTH. 

To each pound of meat and bones add one pint of cold 
water, skim and add one teaspoonful of salt, six pepper- 
corns, one blade of mace, one bunch of sweet herbs, two car- 
rots cut in pieces, two onions cut fine, one potato, one 
turnip cut fine, one teaspoonful of sugar, one-half cup of 
rice ; boil slowly together for four hours, strain and let it 
cool, then skim off the fat, and re-heat. 

WHITE STOCK. 
One knuckle of veal, any cold poultry, four slices of 
ham, three carrots, two onions, one head of celery, twelve 
pepper-corns, one teaspoonful of salt, one blade of mace, 
one bunch of sweet herbs, four quarts of water, one table- 
spoonful of butter. Cut the veal, put it and the trimmings 
of poultry and the ham into the soup kettle with the butter, 
moisten with one-half pint of water and simmer until the 
gravy flows, then add the four quarts of water and the re- 
mainder of the ingredients; simmer slowly for five hours, 
skim, and then strain through a fine sieve, and it is ready 
for use. 



FISH. 17 



FISH. 

Fish is better fried than boiled ; water extracts the 
juices and flavor ; always use a deep vessel with plenty of 
fat for frying. 

Roasted or baked fish are always good, and Sir Henry 
Thompson advises that fish be so prepared. He says : 
" Even a coarse kind of fish if baked with a few slices of 
bacon will yield a good nutritious meal, which will cost 
only one-third of an average meat meal." 

To bake, place the fish in a tin vessel only slightly 
deeper than its' own thickness, with a lid to prevent the 
escape of the flavor; the dish to be well buttered, placed in 
a closed oven and the fish served in the original dish if 
possible. 

FISH BOILED IN COURT BOUILLON. 

Put on the bottom of your fish kettle a bed made of 
sliced carrots, onions, one lemon, some parsley, thyme, bay 
leaf and one tablespoonful of whole pepper grains. On this 
bed place the fish and cover with half white wine and half 
cold water, or water with three wine glasses of good vine- 
gar. Have a moderate fire and as soon as the liquid boils, 
take off the kettle and remove the fish. Serve with a white 
sauce. The bouillon can be strained and kept for several 
days and used several times, but be sure to re-boil it every 
three days. 

BOILING FISH. 

In boiling delicate fish, such as salmon cod or halibut, 
the plunging into boiling water tends to break the fish ; it 
should be put first into water that is on the point of boil- 
ing, kept at this temperature for a few minutes and then 
allowed to fall several degrees and cooked at about 180 
degrees F. The fish will be delicate and have preserved its 
form. 



iS THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

FISH CREAMED. 

Boil a white fish, about three pounds for fifteen min- 
utes, then tak'e from the water and let it cool ; when cool, 
mince it very fine after having carefully removed all the 
bones ; butter a baking dish. Boil one pint of milk ; stir 
together three tablespoonfuls of flour, and two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter ; when smooth stir into the hot milk with 
three sprigs of parsley, two onions minced fine, and the 
yolk of one egg beaten light. Place a layer of the fish in 
the dish, then a layer of the sauce and so on until the dish 
is full. Spread a thin layer of bread crumbs, which have 
been lightly buttered, over the top, and bake for one-half 
hour, 

FRIED SMALL FISH. 

Do not split the fish ; clean them, dip them in beaten 
egg and bread crumbs, or in flour seasoned with salt and 
pepper; have some fat hot in the pan, put in the fish, cook 
them for ten minutes, turn and brown on the other side, and 
serve. For the fat take some slices of salt pork and fry in 
the pan ; when all the fat is out remove the pork and fry 
the fish in the fat remaining. Serve on hot dish. 

FRIED PERCH, SMELT, PORGY OR ANY SMALL 

FISH. 
After each fish is cleaned, put into it a thin slice of fat 
salt pork, three slices of onion and a little green pepper, or 
red pepper, with the seeds removed ; add a sprig of mint if 
obtainable ; tie up the fish or skewer it, bread it and dip in 
beaten egg and fry. The heat drives the flavoring into the 
fish. This is a Cuban recipe. 

FISH CHOPS. 

These can be made with salmon or any other fish. 

Take one-half pound of cooked fish, carefully remove 
all the bones and particles of skin, shred very fine ; add to 
the fish two teaspoonfuls of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
pepper, one-half teaspoonful of cayenne and one teaspoonful 
of onion juice. Boil one cup of milk ; when boiling, stir 
into it three tablespoonfuls of flour, well mixed, with one 
tablespoonful of butter ; when thick remove from the fire 
and add the yolks of three eggs ; stir them well into the 



milk, add the fish, place on the fire again for two minutes, 
then add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley and one tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Spread the mixture on a platter 
and let it rest on the ice for several hours to become stiff ; 
when required take one tablespoonful of the mixture, form 
into a chop, and make all of the mixture into chops ; roll 
each one in beaten egg, then into fine crumbs and fry in 
deep hot fat for two minutes ; serve with a Tomato or Hol- 
landaise sance. 

FISH PIE. 
Four pounds of haddock or bass, boil with plenty of 
salt in the water ; take off the skin and bones, then flake 
the fish. Boil one quari of cream or milk, add one table- 
spoonful of flour stirred into cream until perfectly smooth, 
add one tablespoonful of parsley and one-half an onion 
chopped fine, also one-fourth pound of butter ; after all is 
boiled add a little cayenne ; grease a pan, put in it layers of 
fish, then sauce ; let the last layer be of the sauce ; strew on 
the top a thin layer of bread crumbs ; bake one-half hour. 

FISH PUDDING. 

Cold boiled fish makes an excellent pudding ; salmon is 
particularly good. To one pint of fish add two well beaten 
eggs, three tablespoonfuls of cream, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, a little salt and paprika. Mix them well 
together, breaking the fish into medium-sized pieces. Turn 
the mixture into a bowl that has been well buttered and 
sprinkled with crumbs. Place the bowl in a pan of hot 
water and put into a hot oven. Bake twenty minutes and 
turn out on a heated dish, and have a cream sauce to pour 
around it. 

TIMBALES OF FISH. 

To every half pound of fresh fish add one cup of bread 
crumbs, and one-half cupful of sweet milk; boil thecrumbs 
and milk together, pound the fish to a smooth paste, gradually 
adding the crumbs and milk, then add one-half teaspoonful 
of salt, a little cayenne, three drops of onion juice; when 
all the mixture is smooth fold in quickly the beaten whites 
of five eggs. Have the timbale tins greased, pour in the 
mixture, cover them with white paper and steam for twenty 
minutes ; serve with a white sauce. 



20 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CLAMS RAW. 
Serve on powdered ice, same as oysters. 

QUOHOGS CLAM CAKES. 

One pint of quohogs chopped fine, two eggs, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of baking powder, a little 
salt, just enough flour to stick them together, which is very 
little. Do not use the liquor that comes with the quohogs. 
Fry on griddle or drop in hot fat ; season with butter and 
pepper. 

STUFFED CLAMS. 

Chop your clams very fine, add as much bread crumbs 
soaked in milk as you have clams ; season with salt, pepper 
and parsley ; mix well and add the yolk of one egg. Put 
one tablespoonful of butter into the saucepan, when hot 
add the clam mixture, fry and add one tablespoonful of 
tomato sauce ; fill the clam shells, keep warm until served. 

Crabs can be served in the same manner. 

CLAM FRITTERS. 

An excellent breakfast dish is clam fritters. Chop fine 
two dozen clams, make a batter with one pint of flour, in 
which has been sifted a level teaspoonful of baking powder ; 
add a cup of sweet milk and nearly as much of the clam 
liquor, and two eggs beaten light ; beat hard until it is a 
smooth batter, then stir in the chopped clams ; put plenty 
of lard in the frying pan and let it become boiling hot ; put 
in the batter by the spoonsful and cook slowly, wnen one 
side. is browned turn the fritters and brown the other side. 
The batter may be cooked on a griddle like pancakes if 
preferred. 

CREAM OF CRAB. 

Put one large tablespoonful of butter in a sauce-pan, 
let it brown, then stir in one tablespoonful of flour, when 
thick put in one pint of milk, a little cayenne, one salt- 
spoonful of salt and one blade of mace ; add two cups of 
crab meat and let all boil together for fifteen minutes ; add 
lastly one-half teacupful of cream and one teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley, and serve, 



FISH. 21 

DEVILED CRABS. 

Crabs are in season in May, June, July and August. 

Crabs must be boiled alive, like lobsters. 

Boil twelve crabs, when cold take out the meat. 

Put four tablespoonfuls of cream in the double boilen, 
when hot add two tablespoonfuls of butter as soon as this 
sauce thickens, add the crab meat, one tablespoonful of 
finely chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half 
saltspoonful of cayenne, one-half teaspoonful of lemon 
juice and the finely mashed yolks of four hard-boiled eggs; 
fill the shells, which should be washed clean and dried, 
with the mixture, closely to the edge of the shells ; take the 
beaten yolk of an egg and baste the crabs well with it, and 
then sprinkle with bread crumbs ; fry for two minutes in 
deep boihng fat ; only put two shells at a time in the fat. If 
the fat is not convenient omit the egg and pour over each 
shell a little melted butter and bake in the oven for five 
minutes. 

SOFT SHELL CRABS FRIED. 

Remove the spongy part and the sand bags from the 
sides; wash, wipe, dry and drop them into deep, hot fat ; 
cook for five minutes, take them from the fat, with a skim- 
mer, sprinkle over them a little salt and serve very hot.

on the broiler— shell side down— and broil for twenty-five 
minutes ; put a little melted butter on the lobster to keep it 
from drying. When cooked serve with butter, salt and 
pepper, or with a sauce. 

LOBSTER— TO BAKE. 
Cut the lobster in the same manner as for broiling, 
remove the stomach and intestine, place in a baking pan, 
with a little butter spread over ; when about half cooked 
sprinkle a few bread crumbs over and some melted butter ; 
bake thirty minutes and serve hot.

at once. 

CREAMED LOBSTER. 

Take the meat from a boiled lobster, cut it into small 
pieces, mix two tablespoonfuls of butter, one tablespoonful 
of flour; when hot stir into the mixture, the lobster, a little 
grated nutmeg, a teaspoonful of salt, one teacup of cream

cold and firm form into cutlets. Dip first into bread crumbs 
made very fine, then into an egg beaten, then into crumbs. 
Place in ice box two hours ; when needed fry in deep hot 
fat. Serve with tartar sauce. A small piece of claw should 
be stuck into the end of each cutlet to resemble a bone. 



2A THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

LOBSTERA LA CREOLE. 

One pint of highly seasoned stock, add one cup of to- 
matoes, one garlic clove ; let these cook together for ten 
minutes, strain and return to the fire. Take one tablespoon- 
ful of iDutter and one tablespoonful of flour well mixed 
together and stir into the stock, add some sliced mush- 
rooms and some fresh, green peppers chopped fine and the 
seeds removed — the sauce must be of the consistency of 
thick cream. Have the meat of the lobster cut into pieces, 
cook it in the sauce long enough to become very hot, or a 
better plan is to warm it in a little of the stock before it is 
thickened, then add the balance of the stock. 

DEVILED LOBSTER. 

One lobster, take out the meat and cut into fine pieces ; 
put into stew pan one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour, stir until they are smooth and then add 
one tablespoonful of mustard, one saltspoonful of cayenne

FISH. 25 

BOILED SALMON. 

To cook salmon in perfection a slice should be plunged 
into boiling water enough to well cover it and allowed to 
boil eight minutes. Serve with drawn butter sauce. 

BROILED SALMON. 

Take a slice of salmon weighing two or three pounds, 
have the gridiron hot and greased, place the salmon on it, 
turn often to prevent burning. Cook ten minutes, butter 
on both sides, then place on hot platter, add a little salt and 
pepper. 

DEVILED SALMON. 

Two pounds of cooked salmon, two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, one tablespoon ful of flour, one tablespoonful of 
mustard, one-half teaspoonful of cayenne, one pint of milk. 
Put the butter into the sauce pan, when it bubbles add the 
flour, mix well together, then add the milk ; when the mix- 
ture is smooth and creamy, add the mustard which must be 
made into a soft paste before adding, and the cayenne. Put 
the salmon into a pudding dish, pour over the mixture, and 
on top of this spread a thin layer of bread crumbs and a few 
bits of butter. Bake ten minutes in a hot oven. 

SOUCED SALMON.

26 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CROQUETTES OF SHAD-ROES. 

Two shad-roes, put them into a sauce pan with boiling 
water slightly salted, let them cook slowly for fifteen 
minutes, then take from the fire, pull off the fine skin and 
mash them. Put one tablespoonful of butter into the sauce 
pan, add two tablespoonfuls of flour; when hot, add one- 
half pint of cream, stir until perfectly smooth and thick ; 
remove from the fire and stir in at once the yolks of two 
eggs, add to this mixture one tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, one saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper, one-half a 
grated nutmeg, one-half teaspoonful of cayenne and the 
shad-roes. Mix well together, spread on a platter to cool. 
When cold flour your hands and make the mixture into 
croquettes. Have one egg beaten, dip the croquettes into 
the egg first, then roll in fine bread crumbs, then in the egg 
again. Let them stand in the ice-box for fully an hour 
before frying, then have your fat very hot (see general 
directions for frying), when they are a golden brown color, 
drain them on folded brown paper. Serve with slices of 
lemon and a Tartar Sauce. 

PLANKED SHAD. 

The famous Planked Shad of the Delaware River are 
usually split down the back ; when the fish is split, proceed 
as for planked White Fish. 

FRIED SCALLOPS 

Wash the scallops, drain them well, then dip them into 
fine cracker crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper, then 
into an egg beaten and again into the crumbs ; fry in smok- 
ing hot fat. A Mayonaise dressing is delicious with fried 
scallops. 

SCALLOPS POULET AU CREME. 

Two tablespoonfuls of milk flavored with a little onion 
water or juice. Into this put one quart of scallops, chopped 
fine and the breast of one small boiled chicken, cut fine. 
Add a pint of cream, a lump of butter rubbed with a table- 
spoonful of flour, pepper and salt. Let this boil two or 
three minutes until of the consistency of cream and serve.

in beaten eggs, then in bread crumbs ; fry in hot, deep fat. 
Serve them crisp and dry with Tartar Sauce. 

CREAM SALMON OR TROUT. 

Have the head and tail cut off, put the fish into boiling 
water which has been slightly salted and simmer for five 
minutes, then remove from the fire and drain. Put the fish 
into a stew pan with a little mace, nutmeg, cayenne, all 
mixed together ; then cover the fish with cream, adding bits 
•of butter. Keep the pan covered and let the fish stew for 
ten minutes, then dish the fish ; keep it hot while you make 
the sauce. Take one dessert-spoonful of flour mixed smooth 
with milk; stir this into the cream, add the juice of one 
lemon, let this just boil, then strain, and pour over the fish. 

TO FRY BROOK TROUT OR ANY OTHER SMALL 

FISH. 

Clean the fish and let them lie for a few minutes on a 
clean towel ; season some cornmeal with salt and pepper, 
roll the fish in this and fry them in two-thirds butter and 
one-third lard ; drain on a sieve or on coarse brown paper 
and serve quickly. 

BAKED WHITE FISH. 

Bone the fish and cut into small squares or rounds, 
place them in a deep plate and put bits of butter over, 
some green peppers chopped fine and a little salt ; pour 
over some white wine, cover the dish closely and bake the 
fish for one-half hour ; serve with the following sauce : 

Cook one tablespoonful of butter until it is a delicate 
brown, put in one teaspoonful of capers, and one teaspoon- 
ful of flour ; either add a little more wine or drain the sauce 
from the fish into the butter, then pour it over the fish and 
serve hot. 

BROILED WHITE FISH. 

Split the fish down the back, remove the backbone; 
have the gridiron hot and greased, the fire clear; broil for 
five minutes, turn, cook five minutes, then again for five 



28 THE 3-6-5 COOK ROOK. 

minutes ; serve on hot platter, with melted butter over and 
some chopped parsley, a little salt and pepper ; garnish with 
slices of lemon. 

WHITE FISH BAKED WITH OYSTERS. 

One white fish, weighing about five pounds ; do not 
split, wipe dry on the inside and outside and rub well with 
a mixture of salt, pepper and flour, prepare the oysters 
for stuffing the fish. Take one full pint of oysters, drain 
them and roll each oyster in well seasoned bread crumbs, 
fill the fish, put slices of salt pork over the fish and bake for 
twenty minutes or until the fish is well browned ; baste fre-. 
quently with the water which comes from the fish; serve 
with a tomato sauce. 

PLANKED WHITE FISH. 

Cut the fish on the underside, bone it, wash and wipe 
dry; remove the line of opaque-looking fat on each edge. 
One hour before cooking rub the fish with a little olive oil 
and sprinkle over with one teaspoonful of brown sugar to 
which has been added a little cayenne and one saltspoonful 
of salt. 

The plank should be made of some hard wood and 
always heated before the fish is placed upon it : while the 
fish is cooking it should be well basted with melted butter ; 
cook for a half hour ; when cooked serve with a garnish of 
slices of lemon and cucumber. 

STEWED TERRAPIN. 

(Washington). 
Put the terrapin into boiling water and then simmer 
them until the feet are tender to the touch. Remove from 
the water, clean and pick them from the shells, cut into 
pieces ready for the dressing. To prepare the dressing take 
one pound of butter to three terrapins, melt the butter; when 
hot add the terrapins with one saltspoon of pepper, but no 
salt. Take for each terrapin the yolks of three hard boiled 
eggs, mash the yolks perfectly smooth and add one wine 
glass of Madeira wine, a little at a time, until the yolks are 
reduced to a thin paste ; it may be necessary to add more 
wine, add one-half a nutmeg grated ; place the paste over 



FISH. 29 

the terrapins (it should just cover them) and make very hot. 
The greatest care should be taken not to break the gall 
bladder, as the whole dish will be spoiled if even a drop of 
the gall should touch it. 

TO FRESHEN COD FISH. 
Cover the piece with cold water and let it heat gradu- 
ally ; when it boils the fish will part easily from the bones, 
remove from the stove ; when cool pick it fine. 

COD FISH BALLS. 
Cut the fish in pieces and soak an hour in luke warm 
water, then you can remove the skin and bones easily ; then 
put on the stove in cold water and when it begins to boil 
change the water and repeat twice; this removes the salt 
sufficiently ; then let it cook slowly until very tender. As 
soon as the fish is ready, the potatoes (which must be cooked 
at the same time), must be well mashed and added to the 
fish while hot, with a piece of butter the size of an egg, and 
one egg. You must have twice as much potatoes as fish, 
one cup offish, two of potatoes. Mix well together, mois- 
ten with milk until of the consistency, that will hold to- 
gether, then mold into balls and fry in boiling lard, or if 
you prefer you can fry out slices of salt pork and cook the 
fish balls in it — either is good. 

COD FISH CAKES. 
Wash and boil one quart of potatoes, putting them on 
the fire in cold water enough to cover them, and a table- 
spoonful of salt. Put one and a half pounds of salt cod 
fish on the fire in plenty of cold water and bring it slowly 
to a boil ; as soon as it boils throw off that water and put 
it again on the fire with fresh cold w^ater ; if the fish is very 
salt change the water a third time. Free the fish from skin 
and bones ; peel the potatoes, mash them through a colan- 
der with a potato masher, season them with a quarter of a 
saltspoonful of pepper and an ounce of butter; add the yolks 
of two eggs and the fish ; mix well and make into cakes, 
using a little flour to prevent sticking to the hands. Fry 
them golden brown in enough smoking hot fat to nearly 
cover them ; observe that in frying any article of food it 
will not soak fat if the latter be hot enough to carbonize the 
outside at once, and smoking hot fat will do that. 



30 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CREAMED COD FISH. 
Soak the cod fish for fifteeen hours in a large quantity 
of cold water, skin the fish, pick it all from the bones, cut 
it in small dice pieces. Take a large skillet, put the fish one 
inch deep in this, pour over cold water to cover the fish, let 
it simmer, but not boil, for two hours. About twenty min- 
utes before serving pour off the water and cover the fish 
with milk ; add one-half pound of butter to one quart of fish, 
add a little pepper, a very little salt; let the fish boil, then 
take one tablepsoonful of flour mixed smooth with a little 
water, stir it into the fish while it is boiling ; then just when 
ready to serve the fish add two eggs well beaten ; do not let 
the eggs boil. The fish can be prepared at any time, but 
must be kept covered with cold water ; do not let it stand 
after draining. 

COD FISH ON TOAST. 
(Cuban), 
One teacup of freshened cod fish shredded fine ; fry one 
onion and one tablespoonful of butter until brown, then put 
in the cod fish with enough cold water to cover it, add one- 
half can of tomatoes or six fresh tomatoes ; cook all slowly 
for one hour, add a little salt and pepper. Have ready 
slices of hot toast and pour on them the cod fish. 

SALT FISH. 
Soak the fish in cold water for two days, changing the 
water several times ; when required, dry it well ; fry in the 
pan with one tablespoonful of butter two onions sliced ; 
fry until yellow, remove the bones from the fish, season 
with pepper, one teaspoonful of mustard and one table- 
spoonful of vinegar ; mix with the onions and cook for ten 
minutes and serve very hot. Fish should always be split 
open for broiling. 

TO FRESHEN SALT FISH. 
Lay the fish in cold water with the skin side up, other- 
wise the salt sinks into the skin and the fish will not freshen. 

CROUTES OF HADDOCK. 
Take a finnan haddock about a pound in weight, free 
it from skin and bones, and put it into a stew-pan with two 



FISH. 31 

ounces of butter, four tablespoonfuls of milk, a well-beaten 
yolk of egg, a little pepper and a teaspoon ful of lemon 
juice. Whisk these ingredients over the fire for five min- 
utes, by which time the fish will be smooth. Pile this on some 
small rounds of hot buttered toast. Sprinkle the tops lightly 
with some finely minced parsley and red pepper, and serve. 

FINNAN HADDIE. 

One pound of finnan haddie, put into a pan and cover 
with boiling water, let it boil for five minutes, drain off the 
water from the pan, add one -half tablespoonful of butter 
stir the fish in this, so as to season both sides. Serve hot. 

HERRINGS ON TOAST. 

Cut three good bloaters down the backs, bone them, 
put them in spiced vinegar for ten minutes, then dust 
pepper and salt on the white side ; dip each one into heated 
fat and broil them over a clear fire ; when ready serve on 
toast and add one tablespoonful of lemon juice and one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Be sure to serve the 
fish very hot. 

PICKLED HERRINGS. 

Take twenty-four best fresh roe herrings, have them 
well cleaned ; place them in a large stone crock, putting 
first a layer of herrings, then cover them with salt, a few 
cloves, a little allspice, mace and whole pepper corns; then 
another layer of herrings ; repeat this until the crock is full ; 
cover the whole with vinegar. Place on the range, and 
let all simmer, but not boil, for twelve hours, then the 
preparation is ready to use ; but it will keep for weeks if 
kept covered with vinegar, and the crock tightly closed. 

SALT MACKEREL— TO BOIL. 

Soak the fish, skin side upward, for twenty-four hours ; 
drain, cook in boiling water for five minutes; pour off the 
water and cover fish with sweet milk ; cook for fifteen 
minutes ; remove the fish, thicken the milk with one table- 
spoonful of flour and one-half tablespoonful of butter 
rubbed together ; saltspoon of pepper ; pour this sauce over 
the fish and serve hot. 



32 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

SALT MACKEREL BROILED. 

The fish from Norway are the finest. Soak the 
mackerel for two days in cold ^vater, change the water two 
or three times, wipe dry. Broil over a clear fire, place on 
hot dish, pour one pint of boiling water on the fish, let it 
stand for a minute, then pour it off ; put on the fish a little 
butter, lemon juice and minced parsley, and serve. 

The boiling water poured on and off removes all taste 
of oil from the fish. Do not drink any liquids while the 
fish is being eaten ; if this rule is observed the fish will not 
be apt to disagree with any one, or prove indigestible — and 
salt fish is really a valuable food. 

DEVILED SARDINES. 
Take six sardines and spread over them on both sides 
some made mustard and a dash of cayenne, broil them and 
serve on hot buttered toast ; garnish with slices of lemon. 

SARDINES MAITRE D'HOTEL. 
Take six sardines, a dessert-spoonful of chopped parsley, 
one thin slice of onion pounded fine, one tablespoonful of 
Chili vinegar, half a pint of melted butter, and a round of 
toast; scrape the sardines, arrange them neatly on the toast, 
and put the above sauce over them, adding a squeeze of 
lemon juice and cayenne to it. 

SARDINES WITH EGGS. 
Fry some bread in boiling lard or butter ; cut it into 
fingers ; scale and wipe some sardines, make them hot in the 
oven, and place one on each finger of bread; then pour 
over them the following sauce : The yolks of four eggs 
well whipped, half an ounce of butter, one teaspoonful of 
tarragon vinegar, one teaspoonful of common vinegar, a 
mustard spoonful of made mustard and a little salt. These 
must be well stirred over the fire till the sauce thickens, but 
does not boil. 

KIPPERED SALMON. 
Rub the salmon with an equal mixture of salt and 
sugar ; let this fish stand twelve hours, then smoke it for 
twelve hours. Put the fire far away from the fish, so that 
the smoke will blow over the fish steadily. 



OYSTEUS. 33 



OYSTERS. 

ANGELvS ON HORSEBACK. 
Take very thin slices of fat bacon, cut all the rind off. 
Then take an oyster (or two if very small), pour on it two 
drops of essence of anchovy, four of lemon, and a grain of 
cayenne and roll it in the slice of bacon. Tie them together. 
When there are sufficient of these rolls, put them on a small 
skewer and fry them ; when cooked take each one separately 
and place on a small piece of toast. This is a dish which 
must be served very hot. 

BROILED OYSTERS— I. 
Dry large oysters on a napkin ; roll them in fine cracker 
crumbs, then into melted butter and again into the crumbs, 
add a very little salt and pepper with the crumbs ; broil 
them on a wire gridiron well greased ; they are done as 
soon as-they are a light brown. Serve with slices of lemon. 

BROILED OYSTERS— 2. 

Select large oysters, drain them, lay them on a well- 
greased broiler, place it over a clear lire and turn it as the 
oysters cook ; when done, serve at once ; pour over them 
some melted butter, seasoned with salt and pepper and some 
finely chopped parsley, 

OYSTERS IN BLANKETS. 
Take large oysters, season with cayenne, wrap up each 
one in a thin piece of bacon, fasten with a little wood tooth 
pick ; fry them for a few minutes, serve very hot. 

BAKED OYSTERS WITH SHERRY. 
Fifty oysters ; put one-third in a deep dish ; add a table- 
spoonful of melted butter and cover with bread crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper ; then put one-half of the 
remaining oysters in and proceed as above, then the balance ; 



-^4 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

pour in sherry enough to cover the oysters, add a layer of 
bread crumbs and one tablespoonful of melted butter. Bake 
until colored brown, serve hot. 

BROWNED OYSTERS ON TOAST. 

Mix yolks of two eggs with a little flour. Season

nutmeg; when the mixture boils, add the oysters, cook for 
five minutes. 

OYSTER CUTLETS— I. 
Mix about half a pound of veal with the same weight 
of large stewing oysters ; chop all very finely, then pound 
them together in a mortar, adding two ounces of finely- 
chopped veal suet and three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs 
which have been soaked in the liquor from the oysters ; 
season with a little salt, white pepper and a teaspoonful of 
lemon juice and one tablespoonful of cream. Now add the 
beaten yolks of two eggs and mix thoroughly, pounding all 
a little more, and make up into the shape of small cutlets.

crumbs. Drain them well and send to table very hot. 
Garnish with sprigs of parsley and slices of lemon. 

OYSTER CUTLETS— 2. 
Two dozen oysters, two ounces of butter, one ounce of 
flour, one-fourth pint of cream, three eggs, pepper, salt and 
bread crumbs. Melt the butter, add the flour, the yolks of 
three eggs, pepper and salt. Cut the oysters in half, and 
cook about five minutes in the sauce, but do not let them 
boil ; turn on to a dish to cool, when cold, form into cutlets. 
Cover with the whites of the eggs, and fry in boiling hot 
fat ; serve very hot. 



OYSTERS. 35 

OYSTERS ON CRACKERS. 

An appetizing dish that is easily prepared is oysters 
baked in crackers. Take little butter crackers or any small 
round crackers that will split readily ; split them ; dip the 
pieces in hot water and then spread each half thickly with 
soft butter. Lay half the pieces upon a biscuit tin and place 
an oyster upon each piece ; put a few drops of lemon juice 
upon each oyster and sprinkle them with salt and pepper 
and a dash of mace. Cover the oysters with the remaining 
buttered halves of crackers, brush the tops with melted 
butter, place them in a hot oven and bake them from five 
to ten minutes and serve as soon as they are taken from the 
oven.

of cream, one tablespoonful of curry powder, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one-half a tablespoonful of lemon juice. 
Fry the cocoanut, apple and onion in the butter until they 
are soft, then add the oysters and let all come to the boiling 
point, then add slowly the cream with the curry and flour 
rubbed together into the cream; let all boil, and take from 
the fire in a minute, then add the lemon juice. Serve at 
once as the oysters harden by long cooking. Serve with 
boiled rice. Lobsters, Crabs and Shrimps can be cooked in 
the same way. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL. 

(To Serve Before a Dinner.) 

The juice of two lemons, half cup of tomato catsup, 
four drops of tobasco sauce, one teaspoonful of Worcestshire 
sauce, one-half teaspoonful of salt ; mix together. Fill 
small punch glasses with oysters, pour over the sauce. 
Serve hot toasted crackers with the oysters. 

OYSTER CROQUETTES. 

One quart of oysters, stew them for three minutes in 
their own liquor, then drain them ; when they are cool 
slice them ; this is a better way than to chop them. Pre- 



^6 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

pare a sauce with one tablespoonful of butter and one table- 
spoonful of flour, a few drops of lemon juice or one table- 
spoonful of chopped shallots ; let these boil for five minutes ; 
if too thick thin with a little of the oyster liquor, then add 
the yolks of three eggs well beaten, a little cayenne, one 
saltspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley and 
the juice of one lemon ; put in the oysters and let all boil 
three minutes, then spread the mixture on a platter ; when 
cool make into balls, flattened at each end and about one 
inch thick; roll them in fine cracker crumbs, then in beaten 
egg, then in cracker crumbs. Have the fat deep and very 
hot, place the croquettes in the frying basket and fry for 
only two minutes. Serve the croquettes hot and with slices 
of lemon. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Fifty large oysters ; always use large oysters for frying ; 
wipe them dry in a clean towel. Beat one egg lightly, add 
to it one teaspoonful of warm water. Roll some cracker 
crumbs very fine, season the crumbs with salt, pepper and 
a very little nutmeg. Dip the oysters into the egg, then 
roll them in the crumbs, place them on a platter so that 
they will not touch each other ; place in the ice box for two 
hours, Put fat into the frying kettle ; when it is very hot 
put in the oysters ; the fat must be deep so as to cover the 
oysters, when brown drain them. Keep hot until served. 
Garnish the dish with slices of lemon and parsley. 

FRIED OYSTERS WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 

Select large oysters, drain them and wipe them dry 
with a clean coarse tow^el, then dip them into the follow- 
ing batter : Cook one cup of tomatoes, when hot put in one 
tablespoonful of flour, a little salt and cayenne, a very little 
nutmeg and three drops of onion juice (if liked), the batter 
should be very thick ; strain through the sieve and let it 
cool, then dip each oyster into this instead of into beaten 
egg, then into fine bread crumbs. Place them on the ice 
for two or three hours before frying ; when needed— fry 
them in deep, boiling fat and serve hot. 



OVSTEHS. 37 

FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

One liundred oysters, one-fourth pound of butter. 
Brown the butter, then put in the oysters and let simmer 
for ten minutes ; rub one tablespoonful of flour and butter 
together, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a little salt 
and pepper, and add just before serving three yolks of eggs 
well beaten. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Fill the shells of puff paste wit,h oysters. Cook the 
oysters first in rich cream, slightly thickened, seasoned with 
salt and powdered mace. 

OYSTERS A LA POULETTE. 

One pint of oysters, put them into a stew-pan and let 
them come to the boiling point, but not let them boil. 
Place in another stew-pan one tablespoonful of butter, when 
melted add one tablespoonful of flour; stir until these boil. 
Mix with one-half a cup of cream the yolks of two eggs, a 
little cayenne and salt ; pour this mixture into the stew-pan 
with the butter and flour, slowly and stir constantly until 
it boils, then remove from the fire and strain it over the 
oysters, and serve hot. 

OYSTER POURETTE.

add a dressing of rolled crackers, two yolks of eggs, one 
large tablespoonful of butter, one wine glass of wine, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Serve hot. 

OYSTERS WITH CELERY.

pounded ice ; put one-quarter of a lemon with each portion. 



38 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

OYSTER SALAD. 

Boil one hundred oysters in a little of their own liquor, 
or in half liquor and half milk — the milk makes the oysters 
whiter than the liquor alone ; let the oysters boil for five 
minutes, remove from the fire, drain them carefully, pour 
over them a French salad dressing and place them on the 
ice. When required drain them from the salad dressing and 
pour over a mayonnaise dressing.

BEEF. 



TO BOIL BEEF. 

Always simmer the meat, in this way meat which other- 
wise would be tough, is rendered tender and savory and 
inexpensive pieces are made palatable, juicy and nourishing. 

BOULETTES. 
A palatable way of using cold meats, roasted meat 
only ; mince the meat very fine, add a little fat bacon or 
salt pork ; chop an onion a teaspoonful of herbs one tea- 
spoonful of parsley together, add one teaspoonful of salt, 
one-half teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce, juice of one-half 
lemon, two eggs. Mix all well together, make into flat 
balls about one-half inch thick, fry in lard or butter until a 
light brown. 

BRAISED BEEF. 
Lay a piece of beef of about five pounds in a broad 
pot ; place sliced onions on the top, a little salt and one cup- 



AO THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

fill of stock or gravy, and one cupful of boiling water ; 
cover the pot tightly, add more stock or water if the gravy 
sinks too low ; when done — one hour will cook the meat — 
dredge the beef with flour, take it from the pot, put into a 
pan and place in a hot oven ; as the flour browns, baste the 
beef with butter-water. Ten minutes will be time enough 
to brown the beef; strain the gravy, take off the fat, take 
one tablespoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of tomato catsup, 
boil until the gravy is thickened ; pour one-half over the 
meat, the other serve in the gravy-boat. 

BEEF A LA MODE. 
Fourteen pounds round of beef with bone ; make in 
this four incisions half way through ; take one tablespoonful 
of black pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, rub these into the 
cuts, then mix together one pound of beef chopped fine 
and one pound of suet chopped coarsely, mix, season and 
add one tablespoonful of cloves, two tablespoonfuls of all- 
spice, one clove of garlic, fill the cuts, bind a cloth around 
the beef, cook like roast beef — do not baste. Make a rich 
gravy. 

CORNED BEEF. 

The best piece is from the round, though both the 
rump ai=id brisket pieces are very good. Put the beef into 
a kettle, cover with cold water, bring it to the boilinjj point, 
skim carefully and put back on the range to simmer — do 
not let it boil at all ; allow twenty-five minutes to each 
pound. Keep the water in which the beef was boiled ; re- 
turn the beef which was left from dinner into this, cover 
and put away to cool ; this renders the beef very tender. 
Do not cook cabbage with the beef, cook separately, if both 
are desired. The water in which the beef was boiled, if 
not too salt, is a good foundation for either split pea, po- 
tato or bean soup. 

CORNED BEEF HASH. 
The corned beef should be quite salt, cured with some 
salt-petre ; simmer, not boil, until very tender ; when done 
spread a napkin wrung out in cold water over it to prevent 
it turning black. Potatoes that boil mealy are not good ; 
boil them with the skins on rather underdone and do not 



BEEF. 41 

use until cold. Chop the beef very fine, the potatoes 
coarser, twice as much potato as meat. Put milk or cream 
(cream is better), butter and pepper into a large old- 
fashioned spider ; when hot add the hash, not more than one 
and one-half inches deep ; do not stir it. Keep drawing 
away from the sides of the pan with a spoon, but not to 
mash it. Cook for an hoair or more, quickly at first, then 
set back on the range to simmer. 

Prepare the beef and potatoes the night before using, 
pack all into a bowl and cover closely : it is readv then for 
breakfast — do not spare the butter, if you use cream not so 
much butter is necessary. 

CORNED BEEF WITH CREAM. 
Two cups of cooked corned beef grated, one-half a 
cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Mix together, heat thoroughly, and serve on toast. 

BEEF DRIPPING, TO PREPARE. 
Cut the beef suet into small pieces, place in saucepan 
with a very little water; be careful the suet does not burn, 
as it melts pour into a bowl ; when cold all the impurities 
will be on the bottom of the cake and can be scraped off. 

BROILED FILLET OF BEEF. 
Take one pound of fillet of beef, broil it nicely, but not 
too much ; have in readiness some maitre d' hotel butter 
made thus : Three ounces of butter, one dessert-spoonful of 
minced parsley, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, and a little 
pepper and salt ; work all these ingredients into a cake and 
let it grow cold. After broiling the fillet, place a piece of 
maitre d'hotel butter as big as a walnut on the top. 

HOT POT. 
Cut Gmall pieces of beef from the shank or round, cut 
potatoes in thin slices ; put layer of beef, a little salt and 
pepper, add little bits of butter and a few drops of onion 
juice, if onion flavoring is liked, continue the beef and po- 
tatoes, having potatoes the last layer, until the dish is nearly 
full, then add a cupful of good stock or hot water. Cover 
the dish tightly and bake for two or three hours ; it is well 
to serve it in the dish in which it is baked. 



42 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

HASH. 

Hash, made as the recipe for corned beef hash, of 
either corned beef or roast meat, is very nice baked in gem 
pans, instead of cooking it in the skillet ; when baked turn 
from the pans and serve on slices of hot toast. 

HAMBURG STEAK. 

Use for the steak the ends of the beefsteak, or meat from 
the round of beef; chop very find two pounds of meat, with 
a little of the suet, remove as much of the meat fiber as pos- 
sible ; add one saltspoonful of pepper one teaspoonful of 
salt, one tablespoonful of minced onion (this is not neces- 
sary), press the meat together and make into small flat 
cakes, or in one large one ; broil for five minutes over a clear 
fire, or cook in the skillet, which must be very hot and 
slightly greased before the meat is put in ; five minutes will 
cook the meat ; put melted butter over the cakes, and serve 
very hot. 

MOCK HARE. 

Three pounds of round steak, one-half pound of salt 
pork, all chopped fine; one onion scraped or grated, two 
eggs well beaten, six crackers rolled fine, one tablespoonful 
of pepper, one-half tablespoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls 
of milk or stock, and make into two loaves, like bread, 
scatter cracker crumbs over the tops and bits of butter, and 
baste often. Bake one hour. Thicken the gravy with one 
tablespoonful of butter and flour, then add one can of 
mushrooms. Serve one loaf hot with the mushrooms or a 
tomato sauce; the other loaf serve cold, sliced thin. 

MEAT FIBRIN. 

For enriching sauces and soups. Take four pounds of 
liver; cut it into long, slender strips; roll it in a mixture of 
the following. One-half ounce each of allspice, mace, nut- 
meg, celery salt, black pepper and cloves, all well pounded, 
after which roll it thickly in flour. It will take longer to 
dry in the oven than any other meat. When quite dry grind 
it and mix it with one-quarter pound of heated salt. Bottle 
and cork. Use it in the proportion of one dessertspoonful 
to one pint of good stock. 



REEF. 43 

MOCK DUCK. 
Two pounds of beefsteak from the round, one cup of 
bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper, one-half table- 
spoonful of melted butter, a little cayenne, one-half tea- 
spoonful of chopped onion ; mix well together and spread 
on one side of the steak, roll it and fasten with a little 
skewer ; roast for one hour, then remove from the pan ; 
place it on a hot dish. Thicken the gravy with one table- 
spoonful of flour and strain over the steak. 

BEEF OLIVES. 
Have thin slices cut from the round of beef, slightly 
beat them to make them level ; brush them over with a 
beaten egg, sprinkle with some sifted sweet herbs ; season 
with a little salt and pepper; roll up the slices and fasten 
with a little wooden toothpick. Put into the stewpan one 
pint of stock or one pint of hot water, then lay the olives 
side by side, closely ; put over them some thin slices of 
bacon, stew them very slowly for two hours ; take them from 
the pan, remove the skewers; thicken the gravy with one- 
half tablespoonful of flour and one-half tablespoonful of 
butter rubbed together; pour this over the olives. A few 
drops of Worcestershire sauce or tomato catsup can be added 
if liked. 

OX HEART. 

This is a very economical dish ; it is really very nice. 
Soak the heart in vinegar and water three hours, then cut 
off the lobes and gristle ; stuff the heart with salt fat pork 
chopped fine, the same amount of line bread crumbs, a little 
parsley chopped, a little thyme, pepper and salt ; tie up the 
heart in a cloth and let it slowly simmer for two hours, the 
large end up, then remove from the fire take off the cloth, 
flour the heart and roast it until it is browned ; lay some 
pieces of fat pork in the pan and some over the heart, make 
a gravy by stirring in the pan a tablespoonful of flour and 
a teacupful of hot water. 

VIRGINIA PICKLE FOR BEEF. 
To one gallon of water, add salt enough to float an egg ; 
one tablespoonful of saltpetre, cover closely and let it stand 
for three days. Rub the beef to be corned well with salt 



44 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK, 

and let it reiiKiin in the dry salt for tliree days, then wash 
carefully; rub again with salt, adding one tablespoonful of 
saltpetre to the salt ; let the beef remain in the dry salt for 
ten days, then place in the pickle, and cover closely for one 
month. Beef prepared in this manner can keep perfectly 
for a year, but it is absolutely necessary that all the blood 
be extracted from the beef. 

BEEFSTEAK PIE. 

One and one- half pounds of fine, juicy beefsteak, cut 
into pieces about an inch square, season them well with 
salt and pepper and dredge flour over them. Make a suet 
crust, butter a quart bowl well and line it with the crust, 
press the crust gently on to the bowl ; fill the bowl with the 
meat and one small cupful of cold water ; leave enough 
crust over the edge to form a cover — be sure there are no 
holes in the crust for the gravy to escape, pinch the edges 
together, tie a floured cloth over the bowl — be careful to tie 
it well and firmly down, bring up the four ends of the cloth 
over the top and tie them, plunge the bowl into boiling 
water, and boil gently for two hours. 

BEEFSTEAK PUDDING. 

Make a paste of one pound of flour, one-half pound of 
finely chopped beef suet, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and one- 
half pint of cold water. Roll out the paste until one-half 
an inch in thickness ; line the pudding bowl, leaving enough 
of the pastry to fold over the top. Take one pound of beef- 
steak, dredge with flour, cut into small pieces, with one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one 
tablespoonful of water; fill the pudding dish, fold over the 
crust, and cover the bowl with a clean cloth floured— tie it 
over tightly, put the pudding into boiling water and boil 
three hours, remove the cloth, turn the pudding out; cut 
a small hole in it to let out the steam, and serve. 

POT ROAST— I. 

Eight pounds of the "round" of beef; tie around round 
the beef a broad tape to keep it in round form— add two 
quarts of hot water, a little salt and pepper, simmer slowly 
for two hours; remove the beef, place it in a pan, and 



BEEF. 4:^ 

brown in a hot oven for ten minutes. Use tlie water in 
which the beef was boiled for the gravy. 

POT ROAST— 2. 

Place the roast in an iron pot without any water, but 
with a few slices of fat pork on the bottom ; let the roast 
brown on one side, then turn it on the other; when both 
sides are browned add one pint of hot water, one table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley or an onion sliced. The roast 
requires nearly three hours to cook ; when done, remove 
the meat, strain the gravy and put back into the pot ; add 
one tablespoonful of flour, one saltspoonful of salt and a 
little pepper. Serve hot. 

BEEF ROLLS. 
One pound of lean beef, one-third of a pound of sau- 
sage meat, one-third of a pound of bread crumbs ; mix the 
sausage and crumbs together with one saltspoonful of salt 
and one-fourth saltspoonful of pepper. Cut the beef into 
slices one-half an inch thick, spread the sausage and crumb 
mixture over the beef and tie firmly ; dredge with flour, put 
into the stew pan with one onion, cut in pieces, two table- 
spoonfuls of tomato catsup or tomatoes, one-half a teaspoon- 
ful of Worcestershire sauce, two slices of salt pork, one-half 
pint of water ; cover closely and cook for two hours. 

ROLLED BEEF. 

Cut the bones from the ribs of beef, or take any part of 
the beef that can be made into a long roll— chop very fine 
together one garlic clove, one onion, one-fourth pound of 
fat salt pork, add one saltspoonful of salt, one-fourth salt- 
spoonful of pepper, one-fourth teaspoonful of ground cloves 
(if liked) ; mix these well together and spread over the beef, 
roll the beef, bind with a string and skewers. Put one-half 
tablespoonful of butter in the stew pan ; when it is hot put 
in the roll of beef, brown, add one glass of wine or vinegar, 
one glass of water or stock, one bay leaf, a little pepper and 
two cloves ; let the beef cook slowly for two hours, then 
remove from the pan, skim oflP the fat from the gravy — put 
into the gravy a slice of toasted bread— in five minutes 
strain the gravy through a coarse sieve and serve ; garnish 
the beef with slices of lemon. 



^6 THE 3-6-1^ COOK BOOK. 

SPANISH OLLA PODRIDA. 

One pound of beef, one pound of mutton, one pound of 
lean pork, one-half pound of bacon, one handful of green 
peas. Place all these in a stew pan with enough water to 
cover and simmer slowly ; as soon as the meats are half 
cooked add one-half head of cabbage, two pieces of pumpkin, 
one handful of kidney beans, a few potatoes and two sau- 
sage ; boil together for one hour, season with salt, pepper, 
cayenne, one garlic clove and a little cloves and allspice, add 
one tomato cut in pieces and one onion, boil together one- 
half hour longer and serve. 

BEEF STEAK. 

A beef steak should be at least one and one-half inches 
thick ; trim the steak slightly, beat it in order to flatten it, 
have the broiler very hot— the coals bright, turn the steak 
very often and broil for ten minutes — do not stick a fork 
into the steak while it is broiling. When cooked, place on 
a hot platter and put over it a good lump of butter or a 
maitre d'hotel sauce. 

RUMP STEAK STUFFED AND ROLLED. 

Two pounds of rump steak, two ounces of suet, three 
ounces of bread crumbs, six olives, one dessert spoonful of 
chopped parsley, pepper, salt and two eggs. Peel and chop 
the olives small, chop the suet, put into a basin with the 
crumbs, parsley, olives, suet, pepper and salt ; mix well with 
the eggs. Spread the mixture on the steak, roll and tie 
securely; place in a greased paper and roast about three- 
quarters of an hour. 

STEWED TONGUE, FRESH OR SMOKED. 

Put the tongue into water, enough to well cover it, add 
a small handful of salt, parboil the tongue, then peel it and 
rub it well with mace, pepper, ginger, cloves and allspice. 
Strain the first water, put the tongue back into it, boil three 
hours, throw in two large handfuls of raisins, one table- 
spoonful of brown sugar, one-half cup of vinegar. One- 
half hour before it is done add one lemon cut fine, strain 
the gravy and serve. It should cook in all, four hours. 



BEEF. 



47 



FRESH TONGUE. 

(A Good Entree). 

Boil a fresh tongue until tender, slice it in thin slices 
on a dish, and keep hot, pour over and around the tongue a 
sauce made as follows : Take one cup of raisins, one cup of 
currants, half a cup of citron, one cup of port wine, one cup 
currant jelly, half a cup of butter and a half a cup of vine- 
gar— melt all together and pour very hot over the tongue. 

ROAST BEEF. 
In roasting meat the oven should always be hot so that 
the meat will brown at once— the gravy which exudes, con- 
geals on the outside and forms a glaze ; this glaze seals the 
pores of the meat. Never put water in the pan, and do not 
flour the meat, and never put the salt or pepper on the joint 
before it is cooked or while it is cooking ; when the meat is 
done pour off the fat from the pan, remove the meat, pour a 
little boiling water into the pan, carefully scrape off every 
bit of the glaze on the bottom of the pan, add a little salt 
and pepper, but no flour— the gravy will be thick enough 
without any. 

SIRLOIN OF BEEF. 
The sirloin of beef, about ten pounds, makes three good 
meals ; the thin end can be corned ; the fillet is considered 
the "epicure's piece." The roast is a good one and looks 
well on the table. It is important to remember that the 
smaller the cut to be roasted the hotter should be the fire, 
for an intensely hot fire coagulates the exterior and prevents 
the drying up of the meat juices. Do not apply this to 
large pieces of meat, for meat is a poor conductor of heat, 
and a large piece of meat exposed to intense heat would 
burned and changed to charcoal before the heat had pene- 
trated to the interior. 

A GOOD STEW. 
Take an earthenware jar, put in the bottom a few slices 
of bacon, on this a layer of potatoes, then a layer of onions, 
some chopped parsley, a little sprinkle of sweet herbs, pep- 
per and salt, and a little grated nutmeg, then a layer of 
good beef or mutton, then repeat the vegetables, etc., until 



48 TJIE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

the jar is filled, finishing with a few slices of bacon ; cover 
tightly and place in a deep pan half filled with boiling water 
and bake for three hours. 

BEEF TRIFLES. 

Take a pound of cold roast beef, mince it very finely, 
then put into a basin and mix with it a seasoning of salt 
and pepper, three ounces of melted butter, two tablespoon- 
fuls of finely grated horse radish, six tablespoonfuls of fine 
bread crumbs, and a tablespoonful of minced onion. Mix 
these ingredients thoroughly, then moisten well with two 
beaten eggs. Put the mixture into small well buttered 
cups or molds, bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes, 
then turn out and garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley and 
serve with or without horse radish sauce. 

BONNAR STEW. 

Cut small pieces of meat from the leg, about three 
pounds ; roll all in flour until very white, place in stew pan 
with salt and pepper. Cover with cold water ; simmer 
slowly for five hours. This stew will be found very good 
and most nourishing. 



MUTTON AND LAMB.

/ChUCK \ LOJN / 




MUTTON AND LAMB. 



MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton foi* boiling should be fresh and not 
hang as long a time as for a roast. 

BREAST OF MUTTON BOILED. 

Place the breast of mutton in the kettle with just 
enough hot water to cover it ; let it come to the boiling point 
and then place on the back of the stove and let it simmer 
for three hours ; then remove from the fire and pull out the 
bones. Make a force-meat of one cup of bread crumbs, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of thyme, 
one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, one-half teacupfulof 
chopped suet ; spread this over the breast of mutton, roll it 
up and fasten with a skewer, dip the roll into beaten egg 
and then into fine bread crumbs, place in the oven and 
brown, basting often with butter- water, for twenty min- 
utes or until well browned. Serve hot, with stewed onions. 

SHEEP'S BRAIN WITH BROWN SAUCE. 

Take four sheep's brains — be careful not to break them, 
put into a basin, cover with warm water, remove the skin 
and let them remain for two hours, then put them into a 



5© THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

saucepan, cover with boiling water, add one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, one teaspoonfulof salt; cook until they are firm, 
then put them into cold water for five minutes ; when 
needed, put the brains into one pint of stock, one onion 
stuck with two cloves, one sprig of parsley, one slice of salt 
pork or bacon, and cook for twenty-five minutes. Put on 
a hot dish. Serve with a brown sauce. 

BREAST OF LAMB BROILED. 

Put the breast of lamb into cold water with one onion, 
some parsley or celery, salt and pepper, two cloves and a 
little lemon peel ; simmer until nearly cooked, then take out 
the meat and let it cool ; when cold remove bones, divide it 
into narrow slices, dip each slice into melted butter, then 
into bread crumbs and broil them five minutes and serve. 

BRAISED MUTTON. 

Prepare and cook the same as Braised Beef. 

COLD MUTTON. 
Cut the mutton into chops, dip each piece in beaten 
egg in which put one tablespoonful of milk, then into fine 
bread crumbs and fry in deep hot fat. 

LAMB CHOPS BROILED. 

Proceed as for Mutton Chops. 

CROWN OF LAMB. 

The crown is the side of the lamb with all the ribs 
turned around in a circle to form a crown. The center is 
filled with the trimmings from the bones, when they are 
" Frenched," and a string is tied around the outside to 
keep the crown in shape, and then you proceed as follows : 
Season the lamb with salt and pepper, place it in a roasting 
pan, put one whole onion in center of the crown. Baste 
the meat all over with melted butter, place the pan in a hot 
oven, roast until the meat begins to brown, then add one 
cup of boiling water or meat stock. Roast, basting very 
frequently till done, which will take about an hour and a 
hulf. When done, lay the meat on a hot dish, garnish with 
green peas, carrot balls and potato bdlls. Remove all fat 
from the gravy, mix one tablespoonful of corn starch with a 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 5 1 

little cold water, add it to the gravy, cook and stir five min- 
utes, add sufficient meat stock or water to make one pint of 
sauce, cook five minutes, strain and serve with the lamb. 

BROILED CHOPS. 

Remove the fat, beat them with the steak beater, dip in 
melted butter, sprinkle over a little pepper and roll them in 
pounded cracker crumbs, then place over a clear fire and 
broil eight minutes, four for each side; turn them often, 
serve very hot. A thick chop will take twelve minutes to 
cook ; a thin one nine minutes. Always have the gridiron 
hot before putting on tlie chop. 

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS. 

Remove the fat from the bone, beat the chops slightly 
to level them. Have the gridiron hot and greased, the fire 
bright and clear ; broil the chops eight minutes, place them 
on a hot platter, arrange them neatly ; put a small piece of 
butter on each chop and a little pepper and salt. Serve the 
chops very hot. Mutton chops should be broiled over a 
clear but not fierce fire ; pour a little salad oil over the chops 
and sprinkle them with a little pepper and salt an hour be- 
fore broiling them. 

IRISH STEW. 

Take two pounds of pieces of mutton (the trimmings 
of chops and the neck make a good stew), two pounds of 
potatoes cut in pieces, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half tea- 
spoonful of pepper, two onions may be added if liked, and 
one carrot, all cut in pieces; add one pint of water; let the 
stew simmer for two hours ; add one tablespoon ful of butter, 
then serve hot. 

MUTTON AND LAMB KIDNEYS. 

Fry in butter some slices of bread trimmed free from 
crusts ; split six fresh kindeys, after they are washed, freed 
from fat and skin. Season them well with salt and cayenne, 
lay them in the pan and fry in a little butter; when they 
have cooked for ten minutes remove from the pan, place on 
the slices of fried bread ; thicken the gravy with one table- 



52 rilE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

spoonful of fiour, and one teaspoonful of tomato catsup or 
one teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and one teaspoon- 
ful of sherry or port wine. Serve the kidneys very hot. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. 

Llave the water boiling; put in the leg and let it sim- 
mer, not boil, until cooked — all meats are more tender if not 
allowed to boil hard. Allow twenty minutes to each pound ; 
put one onion and one bay leaf into the water, and a little 
salt and pepper. Serve with caper sauce. 

MUTTON PIE. 

Use two pounds from the neck or loin of mutton and 
two kidneys ; take out the bones, put them into one pint of 
water and cook for one-half hour ; cut the meat into small 
pieces, cut up the kidneys, mix with the meat, sprinkle over 
one tablespoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper, one tablespoonful of minced onion. Put these into a 
deep pie dish with the gravy ; cover with a good pastry, puff 
paste or suet ; bake for one and one-half hours and serve 
hot. 

MINCED MUTTON ON TOAST. 

Mince very fine the remains of cold mutton left from 
the roast or boiled mutton, add to the mince one tea- 
cupful of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little pepper, three drops of onion juice 
(if liked) ; let all become hot, then serve on hot toast. A 
poached egg may be placed on each portion, and will be an 
addition. 

NECK OF MUTTON BOILED. 

Place the neck of mutton in boiling water, to which add 
one tablespoonful of salt ; let it simmer slowly for two hours ; 
then remove from the stew pan and serve with caper sauce, 
or with parsley or butter sauce. The liquor in which the 
neck was boiled should be strained, and the next day it will 
serve as the foundation for a good broth or soup. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 53 

ROAST MUTTON. 

Fouf days before using, bone and season with the fol- 
lowing mixture : One teaspoon ful ground ginger, one tea- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon, one-fourth teaspoonful 
ground black pepper, one-fourth teaspoonful ground cloves, 
one-fourth teaspoonful ground mace ; mix together in one- 
half pint hot vinegar in which has been steeped two bay 
leaves and a small bunch of thyme and sweet marjoram and 
a clove of garlic ; rub the mutton thoroughly with this mix- 
ture — put in a cool dry place for one and one- half days. Fill 
the cavity left by the bone with a stuffing made of celery 
chopped very fine and cooked until tender, mixed with a 
pint of wljite sauce (the bone will make the necessary stock). 
When the meat is needed, cover with mushrooms chopped 
fine and one-half pound of almonds chopped ; then roast in 
hot oven, baste constantly while cooking, with mixture of 
strained tomatoes and rich stock, one pint of each. A glass 
of claret may be added if liked. 

ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

Select a good sized leg of mutton of ten pounds ; in 
winter let it hang for three weeks, unless it has been hung 
for a long time at the butcher's. Before roasting, beat the 
leg well, all over, with the rolling-pin ; this adds greatly to 
the tenderness and delicacy of the meat. Put a clove of 
garlic or a few slices of shallots into the hock end of the leg, 
dredge with flour, spread a little butter over and roast for 
one hour and thirty minutes ; baste the mutton frequently 
with a little boiling water at first, then from the juice in the 
pan. When the mutton is cooked, place on hot platter, strain 
the gravy, skim off the fat. Serve currant jelly with roast 
mutton. 

LEG OF MUTTON STEWED. 

Beat the leg well and rub over a little salt ; grease a tin 
baking pan with butter; put on the bottom two sliced 
onions, two bay leaves, one carrot sliced, one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, one-half a pint of water, one saltspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth saltspoonful of pepper. Lay the mutton in the pan 
and bake in a hot oven until it is brown, basting often with 



24 THE 3-6-5 COOK tJOOK. 

the gravy in the pun ; when brown, put the mutton in a 
stew pan with all the sauce and vegetables and slowly sim- 
mer closely covered for two hours ; if the gravy dries away 
add a little water; remove the mutton, skim the gravy and 
strain it over the meat. One cucumber stewed in the gravy 
is an addition. 

ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

Trim off all unnecessary fat. Wrap the saddle up well 
in greased paper, tie the paper over, roast in the oven, baste 
it frequently— allow fifteen minutes to each pound. Within 
one-half hour of the time for serving, remove the paper, 
brown the mutton. Serve with a clear gravy, very hot. 

VEAL OR LAMB PIE. 

Have your dish well buttered Place first a layer of 
cold veal or lamb cut in small dice, then a layer of cold 
boiled potatoes cut in small dice, then a layer of sliced hard 
boiled eggs, pepper, salt and a little chopped onion and 
parsley, till the dish is within an inch of the top ; add 
enough stock well seasoned to fill the dish ; cover with a 
pie crust, and bake ten minutes or ,long enough to brown 
the crust.

VEAL. 



BREAST OF VEAL FRICASSEED. 

Lay the breast of veal in ^varm water to whiten for a 
few minutes, then cut the meat into small pieces. -Put in 
the stew-pan one-half a tablespoonful of butter, one onion, 
one carrot, a sprig of thyme and a thin slice of lemon peal, 
a little salt and pepper ; dredge the meat with flour, put it 
in the stew-pan with one pint of water; simmer for two 
hours — the meat must not brown ; when ready to serve, 
take out the meat, skim the fat from the gravy and add the 
yolks of two eggs well beaten, and the juice of one lemon, 
one cup of w^hite bread crumbs, a little salt and nutmeg; 
stir these well into the sauce and serve with the veal. 

VEAL BIRDS. 

Veal birds are made in Austria from slices of uncooked 
veal, covered with thin slices of bacon and a sage leaf, then 
tied up and roasted. There is, however, no reason why 
they should not be stewed in this way. A foundation gravy 



56 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

is made of a mixture of white stock and cream, flavored 
with lemon peel, parsley, cayenne, and a dash each of salt 
and nutmeg. The "birds" must stew in this for about two 
hours ; they are nicest when made small enough to serve 
one to a person. This same gravy is good to serve with 
cooked veal minced. 

BLANQUETTE OF VEAL. 

Use the breast of veal. Take three pounds of veal, cut 
into pieces about two inches square ; put these into the 
stew-pan and cover with water ; add one saltspoonful of salt 
and one-half saltspoonful of pepper; boil, and then add 
two onions, two cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs ; simmer 
gently together for one hour, then drain the veal from the 
broth. Stir one tablespoonful of flour and one tablespoon- 
ful of butter together in a stew-pan until smooth, add the 
broth, which must have been strained, stir together ; add the 
beaten yolks of two eggs, strain over the veal and let it all just 
come to a boil, add one tablespoonful of chopped parsley and 
serve hot. Blanquette of veal can be made from the remains 
of cold roast veal ; avoid boiling the veal again, only let it 
become hot. 

VEAL SCALLOPS. 

Take thin slices of veal, cut them into pieces about an 
inch square, season with a little salt and pepper and some 
sweet herbs, dip each piece in the yolk of egg, then into 
bread crumbs; fry some pieces of salt pork, remove these 
from the pan and put in the scallops, fry them brown and 
then add one cup of stock, one-half cup of cream or milk, 
one cup of oysters or mushrooms and one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice. 

CREAM OF VEAL— I. 

Take a pound of fillet of veal, pound it in a mortar with 
an equal part of milk panada. Mix and stir in the beaten 
yolk of one egg and the whipped whites of two, and 
sufficient cream to make into a paste ; add a little pepper 
and salt. Place this in well-buttered molds ; steam for an 
hour ; be sure and do not let it boil. Turn out and serve 
with either tomato sauce or a puree of spinach.

CREiVM OF VEAL— 2. 



Two pounds of veal cutlet, pound it until soft and thin, 
then cut into finger lengths and about one inch wide, dip 
each piece into beaten egg, then into fine bread crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper and a little nutmeg. Put one 
tablespoonful of butter into the pan ; when it is hot put in 
the veal, brown the slices on both sides, then place them on 
a hot dish. Pour into the pan two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
let it boil once, then strain this gravy over the veal. vServe 
with slices of lemon. 

VEAL CUTLETvS. 
Llave the cutlets free from bone if possible; trim them 
into a proper shape and beat them well with the pastry roller 
until the fibre of the meat is broken ; this process improves 
veal, but it is injurious to many other meats. Dip each cut- 
let in flour or in beaten egg and bread crumbs and fry for 
fifteen minutes in good fat, either of dripping or lard, not 
a deep fat. Then remove the cutlets from the fat and pour 
out the fat. Put into the pari one tablespoonful of flour 
and one tablespoonful of butter ; cook these together for a 
minute, then add one cup of broth or boiling water, one 
spoonful of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of salt, one-half a 
saltspoonful of pepper ; strain the gravy over the cutlets 
and serve hot. 

FRIED VEAL CUTLETS WITH CREAM GRAVY. 

Take two pounds of veal from the leg, cut into small 
round pieces ; dip each piece into flour with one teaspoonful 
of salt and a little pepper. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter 
in the frying pan, when hot put in the cutlets and fry 
slowly until they are brown and tender, then remove ; pour 
into the pan one teacup of cream, let it just boil, then strain 
over the meat. Serve hot. 

VEAL CUTLETS WITH MACARONI. 

Use three pounds of veal cutlets from the neck, one- 
fourth pound of macaroni broken into four-inch pieces ; put 
into one pint of boiling water ; when boiling put on the back 
of range to simmer for thirty minutes, then pour in one tea- 
cupful of cold water ; this is the correct way to prevent the 



58 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

macaroni from pulping ; add one saltspoonful of salt. Make 
a gravy from some fine stock, thicken with one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, add one tablespoonful of some good catsup, 
drain the macaroni and put it into the gravy. Cook the 
cutlets; first put them in the beaten 3 oik of egg, then into 
bread crumbs, fry them in fat until they are brown, add a 
sprinkle of thyme over them and a few drops of lemon 
juice. Place the macaroni and cutlets on a hot dish and 
sprinkle with paprika. Serve the gravy in small dish. 

TO PREPARE CALVES' BRAINS FOR COOKING. 
Wash the brains in cold water, drain them, cover again 
with cold water, in which put a tablespoonful of good 
vinegar or lemon juice and one saltspoonful of salt ; let the 
brains soak in this mixture for twenty minutes. Put in the 
saucepan some boiling salted water, drain the brains and 
put them into the saucepan with one onion, one bay leaf, 
six peppercorns and six cloves ; let them cook for thirty 
minutes, then drain them and put them again into cold 
water ; when cold pinch oflf all the fibers you can without 
breaking the brains. 

CALF'S BRAINS. 
vSoak the brains in cold water for one hour, remove all 
the skinny parts, be careful not to bruise the brains ; when 
they are clean and white put them into a stew-pan with one 
quart of water, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, and boil gently for twenty minutes, then remove 
from the pan and let them become cold ; cut them in pieces, 
dip each piece in beaten egg, then into bread crumbs; fry in 
deep hot fat. Serve with a tomato sauce. 

BAKED OR FRIED CALF'S BRAINS. 
Wash the brains, then cook them in salt water for 
twenty minutes, place on a plate and put a plate over them 
and a weight ; when cold, slice the brains, dip in beaten 
egg, then in cracker dust, then in egg, and fry them in a 
little butter, or bake them in the oven. 

CROQUETTES OF CALF'S BRAINS. 
Wash the brains thoroughly till they become white, re- 
move the skin and fibers, then pound them till smooth in a 



VEAL.

mortar. Season with pepper, salt and a pincli of white 
sugar. Add two ounces of milk panada, a beaten egg and 
a teaspoonful of flour ; leave the mixture to get quite cold 
before rolling into balls, then dip in beaten egg and bread

veal^ with one carrot, one onion cut fine, a little salt and 
pepper; lay on the top of these the veal, add one-half pint 
of broth, boil until the broth is thick, then add one pint 
more of broth, and simmer all for one and one-half hours ; 
baste the fricandeau every few minutes, when it is browned 
take from the pan. Skim off the fat and strain the gravy 
and serve over the meat ; place the fricandeau on a bed of 
cooked spinach. 

FRICANDEAU OF VEAL— 2. 
Use four pounds of veal (the fat side of the leg), one pint 
of broth, four ounces of lean ham, one faggot of sweet herbs, 
one carrot, one onion, two bay leaves, one blade of mace, 
one-fourth pound of fat bacon for larding, eight artichoke 
bottoms, six truffles, four mushrooms. Beat your frican- 
deau with a rolling-pin, take off the skin and trim off the 
rough edges, lard the top and sides, cover it with fat bacon, 
lay it in a stew-pan with some trimmings of raw veal under- 
neath it, also the onion and carrot cut up small, the herbs, 
mace, the lean ham, pepper, add salt and a pint of broth. 
Cover the pan close and let it stew slowly three hours, then 
take up the meat, remove all fat from the gravy, boil quickly 
to a glaze, then glaze the fricandeau. Make a rich gravy, 
add the mushrooms, truffles and artichoke bottoms, and 
serve round the meat. 

CALF'S FEET FRITTERS. 

Boil two calf's feet as for jelly, but do not let them stew 

till they fall to pieces, but while they are still firm take them 

out of the stock, split them open, remove the bones (which 

you return to the stock for sweet jelly), and lay the cover-

and pour either tomato sauce around or a sauce composed of 
a half pint of stock, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, 
one of chutnee, a little salt, a lump of sugar, thicken with 
corn-starch and boil the sauce well before serving. 

CALF'S HEAD BOILED. 
Have the head thoroughly cleaned, scraped and split 
open ; see that the ears are clean ; then put the head in cold 
water for an hour. Remove the brains ; be careful not to 
break them and put them into a basin and cover with cold 
water. Put the head into a large enough kettle that the 
water will entirely cover it, bring the water quickly to the 
boiling point, skim and then put the kettle on the cooler 
part of the stove and simmer the head for three hours ; add 
one teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth teaspoonful of pep- 
per, remove from the fire ; remove the large bones and pour 
over the head either Brown, Parsley, Tomato or Bechamel 
sauce. The water in which the head was cooked may be 
used for mock turtle soup, or a white soup. 

CALF'S HEAD TERRAPIN. 

One pint of cold calf's head cut into small pieces, one 
cup of the water in which the head was cooked, one-half a 
teacupful of cream, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a little 
cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of sherry, the yolks of two

season highly with pepper, salt, cayenne, mace and nut- 
meg. Soak the gelatine and melt it with the stock ; line a 
china mold with the bacon cut into very thin slices, then 
put a layer of the cooked meat or poultry, next a layer of 
the pounded liver, and so on, till the mold is full ; pour in 
some of the stock in which the gelatine has been melted, 
cover the top with bacon, and bake in a moderate oven. 
Do not turn it out of the mold till next day. 

ITALIAN CHEESE. 
One pound and a half of calf's liver, cover it with 
boiling water for five minutes, then dry with a soft cloth 
and chop it very fine ; chop one pound of veal and one-half 
pound of ham fine and mix with the liver, add one onion 
chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, a 
little cayenne and a pinch of powered sage. Mix all well 
together and put into a buttered mold, cover tightly and 
steam or boil for three hours, then remove the cover, pour 
off any liquid from the top, pour this into a saucepan and 
while hot, add to it one-fourth of a box of gelatine which 
has been previously soaked in a teacup of cold water, stir 
until the gelatine is dissolved, add a little salt and pepper, 
pour this into the mold over the cheese ; it will fill up all 
the places which have shrunk in the cooking ; shake the 
niold so as to have the liquid settle around the sides ; leave 
it to cool, when cold turn on a platter and garnish with 
slices of lemon and sprays of parsley. 

LIVER AND BACON.

this preparation), then put in the onions, mushrooms, 
parsley and lemon ; put in the liver, cover tightly that no 
steam escapes. Cook for two hours; remove from the pot, 
strain the gravy and pour over the liver. 

BAKED CALF'S LIVER.

onions sliced ; sprinkle all with flour, and baste often in a 
hot oven. Bake one and one-half hours. 

CALF'S LIVER CAKE. 
Pound in the mortar the best part of the calf's liver ; it 
must be perfectly fresh ; add an equal quantity of boiled 
salt pork, pound this in a mortar with some parsley, a little 
salt and pepper. Slice two onions very fine and fry them 
with a little suet dripping. Cut into fine dice enough ham 
to make one-half a cupful, add this to the liver and pork, 
add three eggs beaten separately, beat these well into the 
meat ; grease a plain mold and fill with the m'xture and 
steam for three hours. Turn out the cake on a platter and 
garnish with thin slices of broiled bacon. 

CALF'S LIVER LARDED. 
The operation of larding is done by passing strips of 
larding pork, which is firm, white, fat pork, cut two inches 
long, and quarter of an inch square, in rows along the 
surface of the liver, placing the strips of pork in the split 
end of a larding needle, and with it taking a stitch about a 



VEAL. 63 

quarter of an inch deep and one inch long in the surface of 
the liver, and leaving the ends of the pork projecting 
equally ; the rows must be inserted regularly — the ends of 
the second coming between the ends of the first, and so on, 
until the surface is covered. The liver is then laid in a 
dripping pan on one ounce of carrot, one ounce of onions 
and one ounce of salt pork sliced, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
quarter of a saltspoonful of pepper, three sprigs of parsley, 
one of thyme, three bay leaves, and six cloves ; a gill of

SALT PORK FOR LARDING. 

Salt pork used for larding should be cut in very narrow 
strips and thrown into ice-water for a few minutes before 
using. The ice-water hardens the pork. 



68 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

BACON. 

Bacon can be boiled the same as ham, three hours' time 
required for a piece of four pounds ; when cooked remove 
the skin, sprinkle the top with fine bread crumbs and a little 
brown sugar and brown in the oven. Boiled bacon is 
especially nice, served with boiled chicken. 

BROILED BACON. 

Slice the bacon in very thin slices, cut off the hard lean 
and the rind ; put on the fine wire broiler, cook over a clear 
fire, five minutes. Keep the bacon in a cool, dry place; if 
the slices are placed in the ice-box for a few hours before 
needed, it will be found an improvement. 

CLEAR BACON FRIED. 

Cut off the hard, lean strip from the bacon, then cut 
the slices one-eighth of an inch thick ; have the frying-pan 
very hot, lay in the slices of bacon, turn as soon as they are 
clear, cook a moment on the other side and remove from 
the fire. 

TO COOK BACON. 

Cut the slices very thin, let them stand in the refriger- 
ator for some hours before cooking. 

PORK CUTLETS. 

Three pounds of the loin of pork, three ounces of but- 
ter, lemon juice, three tomatoes, one carrot, one turnip, one 
parsnip, one apple, one ounce of glaze, chopped parsley, 
one pound of chestnuts, pepper and salt. Take a very 
young and tender piece of loin of pork, cut it into delicate 
cutlets, fry the cutlets in two ounces of butter quickly ; boil 
your carrot, turnip, apple, parsnip, and cut them into thin 
strips ; keep the vegetables warm. Boil your chestnuts very 
soft and take the shell and skin off. Pound with pepper, 
salt, and an ounce of butter, and rub through a sieve ; 
arrange as a wall on which to dish your cutlets. Bake 
your tomatoes and use them to garnish the dish. Fill the 
center of the chestnut wall with the cut-up vegetables ; 
pour the melted glaze round the cutlets ; squeeze the lemon 
juice over all.

POOR MAN'S GOOSE." 



Take the liver, heart and sweetbreads of the pig, wash 
them thoroughly. Slice four onions fine, put into the 
baking pan, with one teaspoonful of dried sage ; cut the 
liver into small pieces, lay them with the onions, then cut 
up the heart and then the sweetbreads, pepper all well, and 
cover with thin slices of bacon or salt pork ; set the tin in a 
good oven, bake for one hour, then add one cup of boiling 
water. Send this to the table in the pan in which it was 
cooked. Serve with it, plain boiled potatoes. 

The bacon mentioned in Foreign Cook Books, is equiva- 
lent to our salt, pickled, or mess pork ; not the smoked sides 
and shoulders we call bacon. 

Children as a rule do not like meat fats ; but use bacon 
fat for frying potatoes and they will like it. 

VIRGINIA LIVER PUDDING. 

Soak the pigs' livers over one day and night in salt and 
water, changing the water frequently. Soak the pigs' 
heads in salt and water for the same time, allow two livers 
to every head. After soaking the livers and heads, wash 
them carefully and boil them until soft, remove the bones 
from the heads, put livers and heads through the meat 
chopper, season the meat highly with salt and pepper, mix 
together, heat thoroughly and pour into shallow pans. 
Keep in a cool dry place ; when required, slice in thin 
slices, and fry in a hot pan and serve. 

PIG'S FEET BROILED. 

Have the feet well washed and cleansed, then place in 
a large stew-pan, cover with boiling water, with one 
tablespoonful of salt for twelve feet; let the water boil 
once, sknn, then place the stew-pan on the back of the 
stove and let the feet simmer for six hours. At the end of 
this time, take from the fire, and let the contents become 
cold. When cold place in a stone crock and if desired pour 
over two cups of vinegar and two teaspoonfuls of whole 
spice boiled together. When desired dip the feet in flour 
which has been well seasoned with salt and pepper and 
broil over hot coals for eight minutes. 



70 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

PIG'S FEET FRIED. 
Prepare as for broiling, dip them in beaten egg then 
into fine crumbs and fry in hot fat for six minutes. 

HAM BROILED. 

Slice the ham in thin slices ; have the gridiron hot, 
put on the ham and cook quickly. 

HAM FRIED WITH EGGS. 

Slice the ham in thin slices, fry them in the frying 
pan ; when cooked, remove to a dish and keep hot ; break 
the eggs into the hot fat, cook them until the white of the 
egg is set, then put them on the ham and serve. 

Many persons prefer cold, boiled ham for broiling or 
frying, 

HAM BOILED. 

Soak the ham over night, next morning wash it thor- 
oughly, place in kettle with hot water to cover it ; put one 
pint of cider vinegar and two onions into the water ; let the 
ham simmer five hours— turn it once. Then take from the 
kettle, remove the skin, sprinkle fine bread crumbs over 
the ham, in which mix one tablespoon ful of sugar and one 
tablespoonful of pepper ; bake the ham for one hour, or, in 
place of putting into the oven, the ham can be put back into 
a smaller kettle, and one pint of white wine poured over it 
and the kettle tightly closed and the ham cooked in this 
for one hour. 

LIVINGSTON HAMS. 
For every three hundred weight of hams ; seven 
quarts of fine salt, two pounds of brown sugar, one quart 
of molasses, one pound of saltpetre. Rub the hams with 
this mixture once a week until the mixture is exhausted. 
Then change about the hams, putting bottom ones on top, 
etc. Keep in a cool place for two weeks, and then smoke. 

HAM (BAKED). 
One ham, twelve pounds, seven pounds of flour. 
Make the flour into a paste with water, completely cover 
the ham with it; put into the oven and bake four hours. 
Take the crust ofiF as soon it comes out of the oven ; when 
cold, glaze. 



71 



STEAMED HAM. 



Put the ham in cold water for twelve hours, wash it 
thoroughly, rubbing with a stiff brush to dislodge any salt 
on the outside, put into the steamer, cover closely and put 
over fast boiling water, allowing thirty minutes to each 
pound; keep the water on the steady boil, skin and 
sprinkle fine crumbs over the ham, and serve. 

PIG'S HEAD. 

Boil the head including the tongue in a good sized 
sauce-pan with sufficient water to cover the head, add a little 
salt ; when sufficiently cooked the flesh will leave the bones. 
Chop it very fine while hot, add pepper and salt to taste 
and a little chopped sage, if sage is liked ; put into a bowl, 
press it firmly into the bowl and place a weight on top. 
Return the bones to the stock which, when carefully skim- 
med, will serve for a good soup of peas, oatmeal, etc. ; the 
fat to be used for frying. Oatmeal is very good in the soup, 
dredge in the meal, carefully stirring all the while. 

LEG OF PORK ROASTED. 

Take a leg of pork of about seven pounds, roast it, al- 
lowing twenty minutes to each pound, baste it frequently 
with the gravy which runs out from the leg ; when done 
place on a platter, pour off the fat in the pan, add a little 
hot water, scrape the pan well ; if the gravy is liked thick- 
ened, add one tablespoonful of flour, one saltspoonful of 
salt and a little pepper. 

STEWED LEG OF PORK— r. 

Take a leg of young pork, rub it well with salt and let 
it lie in the salt for a week. When ready to cook it, place 
it in an iron pot with just enough water to cover it and let 
it simmer for four hours, skimming off the fat. Then re- 
move the leg of pork, strain the water, put into the pot one 
pint of good vinegar, one-half pound of brown sugar, one 
pint of the water in which the pork was boiled. Put in 
the pork, cover well and place the pot in the oven and let 
it cook for two hours or longer. The pork should be well 
browned. Serve with the gravy in the pot, and apple 
sauce. 



72 THE 3-6-5 COOK IJOOK. 

STEWED LEG OF PORK— 3. 
Put into the kettle one leg of young pork, one carrot 
cut tine, two onions sliced, a bunch of sweet herbs, one 
tablespoonful of butter and water to half cover the leg ; 
cover the kettle tightly, and cook the pork for two hours. 
Turn the leg once. When cooked, remove the pork, add a 
little boiling water to the gravy, thicken with one table- 
spoonful of flour, add a little salt and pepper, and pour this 
sauce over the pork and serve. 

PORK MEAT-CAKE. 
Chop some cold pork very fine ; grate two potatoes and 
one onion ; mix with the pork ; add two eggs well beaten, a 
little salt and pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of milk; make 
into a cake and fry in a little fat. Serve hot. 

BONED SPARE-RIBS OF PORK STUFFED. 

Six pounds from the piece of spare-ribs of pork, it con- 
sists of the flat bones cut from the loin ; slip out the bones, 
flatten the meat with chopper, dust it with pepper and then 
spread on it this stuffing : Two well-cooked onions, one 
tablespoonful of dried sage, one pound of chopped apples, 
a little pepper and salt ; mix well together. Roll the meat 
up tightly, fasten at each end with string, place in the oven 
and baste often, it will be cooked in one and one-half hours ; 
dish it very hot — serve with roasted potatoes and a dish of 
good apple sauce. 

SCRAPPLE— I. 

Four pounds of pork, the lower part of belly with skin 
on, one pound of beef liver ; after cleaning pork, boil both 
together with plenty of salt and pepper, cook until tender, 
then chop fine, each separately. Sift into the liquor two 
teacups of cornmeal, let boil until well cooked, add salt, 
pepper and sage to taste, then add pork and liver and one 
cup of buckwheat flour — don't make it thick, pour into 
pans. 

SCRAPPLE— 2. 

Boil together six pig's feet and a jowl, until they rre 
so tender you can pull out all the bones ; then chop the meal 
fine. Put into the liquor when boiling, enough cornmeal 
to thicken the mixture, cook all well together, season with 



PORK. y^ 

salt and pepper, then add the meat. Put into shallow 
dishes, slice when needed and fry. 

SAUSAGE. 

For forty pounds of meat, thirteen ounces of salt, four 
ounces of pepper, one ounce of sage. .Spread the meat out 
on a table, and sprinkle the salt, pepper and sage over it, 
stir well ; then grind the meat very fine, by seasoning 
before grinding every bit is well done. It is wise to make 
the meat up into balls and fry, then pack away. If the 
meat is to be kept, cover well with lard. 

Sausage can be kept for several months, perfectly 
sweet, if after it is prepared, it is made into small balls 
(enough for one person) and fried a little on each side ; then 
pack the balls into a stone crock and pour over the top some 
melted lard. Keep the sausage meat in a cool, dry place. 
When needed, fry the balls in a very little lard. 

BOILED SAUSAGE. 
Put the sausage into boiling water and cook for ten 
minutes ; serve with a turkey or chicken. 

BROILED SAUSAGE. 

Have the broiler hot and greased ; broil the sausage for 
five minutes ; serve on hot toast. 

FRIED SAUSAGE. 
Have the pan very hot ; put in the sausage, fry for ten 
minutes, turn them once, and serve hot. 

SAUSAGE ROLLS— I. 
Make a light biscuit dough with milk, let it rise over 
night ; in the morning roll it out very thin, cut into biscuits, 
place a sausage in the center of each, fold over the dough ; 
let it rise again, then bake in hot oven. 

SAUSAGE ROLLS— 3. 
Roll out some good pastry, a pufF paste is best ; roll out 
to one-eighth of an inch in thickness, then cut the paste in 
five-inch squares ; wet the edges with a little beaten egg ; 
mince up any cold meat with a little ham, season with salt 
and pepper or use sausage meat. On each square spread 
two ounces of the meat, fold, press the ends together, brush 
over the rolls slightly with the egg, and bake in a quick oven 
for fifteen minutes. Send them to the table on a napkin.

POULTRY, 



HOW TO CHOOSE AND PREPARE POULTRY. 

An old test in choosing poultry is the condition of the 
breast bone. Touch the end of it and if it bends easily from 
side to side the bird is under a year old, and tender. If 
not it will serve best in fricassees and stews. The skin of 
the chicken should be firm, smooth and white ; the feet 
short and soft, the legs long, smooth and yellow, the spurs 
small and comb red and fresh, while the eyes are bright and 
full. Pin feathers denote a young chicken, while on fowls 
there are long hairs. The drawing should be done as soon 
as the bird reaches the kitchen. The first step consists in 
removing the pin feathers and hair. This is usually done by 
holding the bird by the head and feet and turning it con- 
tinually over a flaming newspaper. As there is danger of 
smoking the flesh by this process it is really better to use a 
small quantity of ignited wood alcohol. 

Cut off the head, cut the skin down the back of the 
neck and fold it over, while you carefully remove the crop 
and wind pipe, then cut the neck off close, leaving the skin 
to fold back over the opening. 

Next cut a small opening under the rump, run the finger 
around so as to loosen the entrails. Do the same at the 
neck. Carefully draw them out ip one solid mass without 
any part being broken ; cut around the vent to free the large 
intestines. If by accident the gall sack or the intestines 
should be broken the inside of the chicken must be washed 
quickly and wiped immediately, otherwise the outside treat- 
ment here will suffice. Cut the oil sack away from the 
rump ; cut the gall sack from the liver. 

Cut open the outer coat of the gizzard and draw it away 
from the inner sack, leaving this last unbroken. Open the 
heart and wash free from blood. These inner organs and 
the giblets are to be saved for the gravy. 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 75 

Nothing improves a bird more than the drawing of 
the sinews from the legs. This, if done, is accomplished 
before the entrails are drawn. Bend the leg back slightly 
and carefully cut the skin at the joint just enough 
to expose the sinews; run a skewer in each of them 
in turn and carefully draw them out. After a little practice 
has given skill you can get out as many as eight. The one on 
the back of the leg is the one you should be particularly 
persistent about, since it is so large and strong. In turkeys 
especially these sinews are so tough that in cooking they 
become almost as hard as bones, but if removed the drum- 
stick is as tender as any other part. 

If frozen the fowl should be put into a warm room to 
thaw several hours before needed. Do not soak it to thaw it. 

BREADED SPRING CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken before cooking, season with salt and 
pepper. Take two eggs beaten lightly, put them into one- 
half cup of milk, and stir into this mixture two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour ; dip each piece of chicken into this and after- 
wards into bread crumbs. 

Bake the chicken in an oven on a pan; make a gravy 
of one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
one tablespoonful of butter, boiled together. 

BOUDIN OF CHICKEN AND TRUFFLES. 

Put half a pint of \vater into a stew-pan with a pinch 
of salt and an ounce of butter ; when it boils stir into it enough 
flour to make a thick paste ; put it by to get cold. Take the 
flesh from a fowl and pound in the mortar, add half its 
bulk of the above paste, and half that quantity again of 
butter, then salt, pepper, a small piece of shallot and a little 
nutmeg. Mix the whole in the mortar and work into 
this mixture one whole egg and the yolks of three. Pass 
the w^hole through a sieve and work in a gill of cream. 
Take a mold, butter it well (or use several small ones) ; cut 
truffles in slices, stamp them in any shape and arrange them 
against the molds in pretty devices. Half fill the mold or 
molds ; tie a piece of paper on the top ; place in a stew-pan 
half full of water and steam for fifteen to twenty minutes. 
Turn out carefullv and serve with truftle or tomato sauce. 



76 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

BROILED SPRING CHICKEN. 

vSplit the young chicken down the back, remove all the 
entrails, wipe dry, flatten with the rolling pin ; place in the 
oven for five minutes to heat it, then dip the chicken into 
some melted butter, place on the hot gridiron with the in- 
side down ; broil for fifteen minutes, turning it once ; when 
cooked, place on a hot platter and spread some butter over 
it with salt and pepper or some maitre d' hotel butter. 

TO PREPARE SPRING CHICKENS. 

Young spring chickens are often dry; dip them in 
melted butter or olive oil before broiling them. It is a very 
good plan to place the chickens in a hot oven for ten min- 
utes before you put them on to broil. 

CHICKEN AU CASSEROLE— I. 

Put about one and one-half ounces of butter into a fire- 
proof casserole with two ounces or so of fat bacon cut up into 
dice, a pinch of salt, a sliced onion, or two or three shallots 
and a sliced carrot ; let all this brown gently, and when 
quite hot lay in the fowl dressed as for roasting ; let it color 
till of a pale golden color on both sides, then pour into the 
pan half a pint or so of good stock ; cover down very closely 
and let it stew gently in the oven till done, and either serve 
neatly dished on a hot dish, or better in the pan in which 
it was cooked. This is the simple form of "poulet au cass- 
erole," but needless to say, it can be made richer in a 
variety of ways, adding a tablespoonful of sherry or a sherry 
glassful of chablis to the stock ; or rich, strong gravy, 
put in with the fowls, truffles, mushrooms, tiny silver or 
pickling onions, some small slices of ham, or some of the 
small French sausages,— these can all cook with the fowl as 
before. 

Almost any meat can be cooked in this way. Beef- 
steak cut up and stewed thus, with half stock, half red wine 
and silver onions is particularly good. 

CHICKEN AU CASSEROLE-3. 

Put a small spring chicken into the casserole with 
a little water, one tablespoonful of butter and some 
potatoes cut into round balls with the vegetable cutter. 



POULTRY — CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 77 

Place in the oven and cook thirty minutes, then add one 
can of mushrooms, a flat tablespoonful of chopped onion, 
one-half a wine glass of extract of beef or one-half cup of 
rich stock, one-half a wine glass of sherry, a little salt and 
pepper, and thicken the gravy with one tablespoonful of 
flour; to do this, push the chicken on one side, return to 
the oven and cook for five minutes and serve at once. If the 
chicken is old, parboil or steam it for one hour, then put in 
the casserole and cook as for spring chicken. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES— I. 
Boil one chicken and two sweet breads ; when cold chop 
them fine. Take one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour; fry together; then add one-half pint of 
cream, a few drops of onion juice, add the chicken and 
sweet bread ; stir well together, add salt, mace and cayenne. 
Spread the mixture thinly oir a platter; when cold shape 
into croquettes, dip each into beaten egg, then into bread 
crumbs or cracker crumbs; have the fat boiling hot and 
deep ; before frying put the croquettes on the ice for two 
hours. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES— 2. 
(Washington.) 

Take two chickens, boil them in a little water until 
tender. Two sets of brains, prepared as "brains, to cook." 
When the chickens are cold remove the meat and chop it 
very fine ; one teacupful of suet chopped fine, two sprigs 
of parsley minced as fine as possible, the juice and rind of 
one lemon, one nutmeg, one tablespoonful of finely chopped 
onion, one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. 
Mix these all well together and add enough cream to make 
the mixture very moist ; have it as soft as possible and be able 
to mold it. Make the mixture into croquettes, either with 
a mold or with the hands; dip them into beaten egg, then 
into fine cracker crumbs ; fry them in deep, hot fat or lard. 
This quantity should make twenty-four croquettes. 

Cold veal or lamb can be used in the same manner. 

CURRY OF CHICKEN. 

One good-sized, young chicken, two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, two onions sliced, one small, even tablespoonful of 



78 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

grated cocoanut, one-half an apple cut fine, one pint of 
stock, one tablespoonful of curry powder, one tablespoonful 
of flour, four tablespoonfuls of cream, one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice; cut the chicken into pieces, fry the onions, 
cocoanut and apple in the butter; when fried add the stock 
and stew gently for fifteen minutes, then add the curry 
powder and flour rubbed together with a little stock ; stew 
for fifteen minutes, then add the cream, which should be 
hot, and lastly the lemon juice. 

DEVILED CHICKEN. 

Take any cold, cooked chicken and cut into small 
pieces ; dip them into a little melted butter, then into a 
paste made of one teaspoonful of French mustard, one-half 
teaspoonful of English mustard, one teaspoonful of Worces- 
tershire sauce, one-half saltspoonful of cayenne, one salt- 
spoonful of salt. Then place the j^ieces of chicken in a dish, 
cover them with fine bread crumbs and a few bits of butter, 
and bake for fifteen minutes. Turn the chicken on to a hot 
plate, garnish with some watercress seasoned with salt and 
pepper and a little oil and vinegar. 

Any cold game or poultry can be deviled in the same 
way. 

ESCALLOPED CHICKEN. 
Boil two chickens until they are tender ; when cool pick 
the meat from the bones and cut into small pieces. Butter 
a pudding dish, put in one layer of chicken, then a layer of 
sauce made of one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, 
one tablespoonful of flour cooked together. Put the butter 
that has been heated into a saucepan ; stir in the flour ; 
when smooth add the cream, a little salt, pepper and 
powdered mace ; fill the dish with alternate layers of chicken 
and sauce ; on top put some very fine bread crumbs in which 
one tablespoonful of butter has been rubbed. Bake one- 
half hour. Serve in the dish it was baked in. 

BONES FOR SOUP. 
Return the bones to the water in which the chickens 
were boiled; boil together one hour and strain, and when 
cold take off" the fat. This will make a good broth, or a 
good foundation for a white soup. 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 79 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN. 
Take one chicken weighing about three pounds, cut it 
into pieces neatly ; let these stand in cold water for a half 
hour, then drain and put them into the stew-pan with one 
quart of water, one onion with two cloves stuck in it, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one-half 
pound of salt pork cut in small pieces; boil, skim and then 
place the saucepan on the back of the stove for two hours, 
then remove the chicken ; take out the onion ; stir together 
one tablespoonful of flour and one tablespoonful of butter 
and one tablespoonful of cream ; stir this into the broth ; 
when the broth thickens pour it over the chicken and serve. 

VIRGINIA FRIED CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken into pieces, dip each piece into flour 
which has been well seasoned with pepper* 

Take slices of salt pork, put them on the frying pan 
and cook until the fat is all extracted ; remove the pork and 
fry the chicken in the fat ; fry slowly for twenty minutes if 
the chickens are quite young — rather longer if they are old. 
Then remove the chickens, arrange neatly on a platter and 
keep warm while you make the gravy ; stir into the fat one 
cup of milk (of course, cream is better) in which you have 
mixed a tablespoonful of flour; as soon as it thickens, pour 
over the chickens. 

HUNGARIAN CHICKEN OR PAPRIKA HULM. 

Take one large tablespoonful of butter, put into the 
stew-pan ; add two onions sliced tine ; when they are of a 
light brown color add one-half teaspoonful of paprika ; let 
the onions brown a few minutes longer, then add the 
chicken cut into pieces and one-half teaspoonful of salt ; 
brown the chicken ; when this is done add one pint of good 
stock or boiling water ; stew very gently with the pan 
closely covered until the chicken is cooked ; remove from 
the pan, put on a hot dish ; add to the gravy one teacup of 
rich sour cream ; let this scald only in the gravy and then 
strain the gravy over the chicken. 

CHICKEN PIASII. 
Mince cold roasted or boiled chicken, not too fine. To 
each cupful of meat add two tablespoonfuls of butter, one- 



8o THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

half a cup of milk, one minced onion, one teaspoonful of salt, 
a little pepper. Mix well together, cook, and stir frequently. 
Serve on toast with a garnish of parsley. 

CHICKEN HASH WITH EGGS. 
Prepare as above, but just before serving poach as many 
eggs as required and place on the hash. 

CHICKEN HASH ON RICE TOAST. 
The night before, prepare some boiled rice and set away 
in a dish, with a weight on top. The next morning cut it in 
slices one-half an inch thick ; brush over with melted butter, 
lay between a double broiler and toast a delicate brown ; 
put bits of butter on each, season with salt and pepper, 
squeeze over a few drops of orange or lemon juice ; hash 
the chicken, heat in brown or cream sauce and place it on 
the rice. 

CHICKEN JELLY. 
Cut up one-half an old chicken, one calf's foot and one- 
half pound of veal ; put in soup-kettle with three pints of 
cold water, one-half teaspoonful of salt ; boil and then skim 
carefully; add one tablesp-oonful of chopped carrots, one 
tablespoonful of onions chopped fine, one-half tablespoonful 
of blanched almonds. Simmer the broth until all the meat 
is tender; skim again, and then strain the broth through a 
fine sieve or napkin ; if desired very clear, after straining, 
add the white of an egg beaten very light ; stir this into the 
broth and let it boil up, then remove and strain again. Put 
into small molds or cups and place on the ice. 

JELLIED CHICKEN— I. 
Boil one chicken ; when cold cut the meat into small 
pieces ; place in the mold a layer of the chicken seasoned 
with salt and pepper, then a layer of a few capers or truffles, 
then the chicken ; press all down to make it solid. When 
the mold is full, pour over the water in which the chicken 
was boiled, in which you have put one tablespoonful of but- 
ter. Cover and place in the ice-chest for a few hours. 

JELLIED CHICKEN-2. 
Cut up a good-sized chicken, leave the breast whole; 
put all into a stew-pan including the liver, gizzard and 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY, 8l 

heart, put over it one quart of cold water and let it come to 
the boiling point slowly, skim and add one bay leaf, four 
cloves, one sprig of thyme, three sprigs of parsley, three 
slices of lemon ; simmer for one hour; do not let it boil, or 
the meat will be tough ; cut off the meat in small pieces, 
excepting the breast, cut this in four long strips ; put back 
the bones into the pan with one-half an ounce of gelatinje 
which must be previously soaked in a little cold water. Let 
the bones stew a little longer, then strain through a napkin ; 
take the jelly mold, pour into it a little of the gravy; let 
it harden ; cut one hard-boiled egg into slices, place these 
in the jelly ; slice the liver and put them over the eggs and 
the breast ; pour over some of the jelly, then when it is 
hard put in the meat and pour over the balance of the jelly. 
Remains of cold turkey or game can be made into a 
jellied dish ; their bones stewed dowm for the gravy, and if 
liked, some lean ham can be chopped fine and added. 

JELLIED CHICKEN— 3. 

Jellied chicken is a delicious cold dish to serve witli 
cresses or lettuce. Cut a fowl into four parts and cover 
them with boiling ^vater ; add a stalk of celery, one 
slice each of carrot and onion, a bay leaf, a couple of 
cloves and half a dozen of peppercorns. Cover the kettle 
and let the liquid slowly simmer over the fire until the fowl 
is tender. Remove the chicken and let the liquid become 
cold ; then take off all the fat and reheat the liquid. 
Season it with salt and a little cayenne pepper, and then 
add half an ounce of gelatine that has been soaked in a 
little cold water an hour or more, and stir until it is entirely 
dissolved ; then strain the liquid into an earthern bowl. Free 
the chicken from skin and bone and cut it into moderate 
sized pieces. Wet a plain mold with cold water and lay upon 
the bottom and sides some slices of hard-boiled eggs ; then 
put in the prepared fowl and some shreds of cold boiled 
ham or tongue scattered among the chicken ; very thin 
slices of cucumber pickles are also frequently added. Pour 
over the whole the liquid jelly and place the mold in a cool 
place to harden. Turn it out upon a platter and garnish 
with cresses or salad leaves.

CHICKEN LIVER WITH BACON. 

Take the livers, roll them in melted butter, then in fine 
breadcrumbs; season with salt, pepper and a little cayenne. 
Broil them for five minutes, first flattening them a little. 
When cooked, serve in a hot dish with a maitre d'hotel 
butter, and garnish with crisp slices of bacon. 

Broiled squabs, quail, grouse and woodcock are 
properly served with garnish of bacon. 

CHICKEN A LA MARENGO. 

Prepare the chicken as for fricassee ; put the pieces 
into a stew-pan with one tablespoonful of olive oil, two 
shallots, one teaspoonful of salt, one bay leaf, one-half tea- 
spoonful of pepper, one garlic clove, one bunch of parsley, 
one sprig of thyme, fry these together for twenty-five 
minutes, or until the chicken is tender, then take from the 
pan and keep hot. Take one tablespoonful of flour, inix it 
with a little cold water, stir it into the broth, cook for ten 
minutes, then drain over the chicken and serve ; do not 
skini the broth. 

CHICKEN PATTIES. 
Cut in very small pieces the breast of a cooked chicken. 
Put in the stew-pan one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour ; stir together ; when smooth add one 
tablespoonful of cream, a little nutmeg, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a little cayenne, then add the chicken. Do not 
let the mixture brown ; fill the patty-cases and bake. 

CHICKEN PIE— I. 
Cut in pieces a good-sized chicken, pull off" all the skin 
you can; cook the chicken in the stew pan with a pint of 
water, one slice of lean ham, one onion, four peppercorns, 
one-fourth pound of salt pork cut in pieces, until tender; 
then remove the chicken and the pork, place the pieces in 
a deep pudding disli. Rub together one tablespoonful of 
flour, and one tablespoonful of butter, stir this into the 
liquor in which the chicken was cooked, add one-half cupful 
of cream or milk or more ; when the gravy is thickened and 
smooth, strain into the dish with the chicken. Cover the 
dish with pastry and bake until the pastry is done— one-half 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 83 

an hour is generally the time required. Make the pastry 
either with suet or butter. 

Veal pie can be made in the same manner, only sub- 
stituting veal for chicken, and leaving out the salt pork. 

CHICKEN PIE— 2. 
Cut into pieces two chickens, put them into a kettle 
and cover with water ; add one saltspoonful of salt and one- 
fourth saltspoonful of pepper. Simmer the chickens until 
they are tender, then remove from the fire, take from the 
kettle, leaving the gravy in the kettle, and put the pieces 
into a deep dish which has been buttered. Make a batter 
with one pint of sweet milk and two eggs well beaten and 
enough flour to make the batter the consistency of thick 
cream; add one pinch of salt, season the chicken with a 
little salt and pepper and add one tablespoonful of butter; 
pour over the batter and bake one-half hour. Thicken the 
gravy with one tablespoonful of flour, rubbed smooth with 
a little milk, and boil for five minutes. Serve it in a gravy 
boat with the pie. 

CHICKEN POT-PIE. 
Cut a chicken into pieces, put it into the stew-pan with 
water enough to cover the pieces, one-half pound of salt 
pork cut in pieces, one saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper ; 
let the chicken simmer slowly ; when it is nearly done, put 
in the dumplings, made the same as soda biscuits, cover the 
pan and let them cook for one-half hour. Put the pieces of 
chicken in the center of the platter, the dumplings around 
them. Thicken the gravy with one tablespoonful of flour 
mixed with one tablespoonful of butter, add two tablespoon- 
fuls of cream or milk ; strain the gravy over the chicken and 
serve. 

CHICKEN WITH POACHED EGGS. 

A nest made of bits of cooked cliicken for serving 
poached eggs in, is a tempting way to use up the ragged 
pieces. Chop the meat very fine, and for two cups of meat 
add one tablespoonful of melted butter, the same quantity 
of cream, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a little 
salt and cayenne pepper, and two beaten eggs. Put the 
ingredients in a saucepan and let them thoroughly heat so 



84 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

as to set the eggs. Turn the mixture on a hot platter and 
form it in a flat mold with a ridge around the edge. Mean- 
while poach the eggs required and place them carefully on 
the meat. Garnish the dish with parsley and slices of hard- 
boiled eggs around the mold. 

ROASTING TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 
Before I'oasting either a turkey or chicken, after it is 
stuffed, pound it well all over with the rolling-pin ; the 
pounding renders the fowl tender and plump ; then spread 
the fowl all over with butter and flour mixed to a smooth 
paste; this mixture is the greatest possible improvement. 
Another way is to blanket the fowl all over with thin slices 
of salt pork ; use the dry salt pork always for larding or for 
blanketing. It is far better than pickled pork for this pur- 
pose. If the chicken is very fat, bind over the breast the 
chicken fat. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 
A chicken a year old is generally used for roasting ; if 
an older fowl is used, steam it for one hour before roasting. 
Have the chicken nicely prepared ; it can be stuffed or not ; 
draw the drum sticks together, tie them ; blanket the chicken 
with thin slices of salt pork ; baste frequently in the oven ; 
allow fifteen minutes for each pound ; just before the chicken 
is ready, rub some butter over the breast and legs with some 
salt and pepper. Serve with a gravy made of the giblets. 

SWEDISH CHICKEN. 
Young spring chickens are the nicest for this preparation, 
though chickens a year old can be used. Have the chickens 
left whole ; clean them. Take one-fourth pound of butter 
and one large bunch of parsley— take the leaves only— chop 
them fine and mix with the butter and a little salt ; fill the 
chickens with this mixture. Put into the braising-pot (an 
iron pot with a closely-fitting iron lid), two tablespoonfuls 
of butter ; brown the chickens in this ; then put the pot on 
the back of the stove ; add one pint of cream to the chickens ; 
cover the pot and let the chickens simmer, not boil, for one 
and one-half hours if young ones are used; two hours if 
older. Cook the giblets with the chickens. When ready 
to serve remove the chickens and thicken the gravy with 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TUHKEV. 85 

one tablespoonful of flour ; strain this gravy and serve with 
tiie fowls. 

CHICKEN STEWED. 
For one chicken weighing three pounds, take one table- 
spoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of Hour, one large 
onion cut fine, three slices of carrot, three slices of turnip, 
three pints of boiling water, one saltspoonful of salt, one-half 
saltspoonful of pepper. Wash the chicken, put it into a 
large stew-pan and let it boil gently, put the carrot, turnip, 
and onion with the butter in a saucepan and cook slowly 
for one half hour, stirring them often ; skim off two table- 
spoonfuls of the fat from the chicken, remove the vegetables 
from the saucepan, put in the fat, add the flour and stir 
until a dark brown; mash the vegetables through a sieve 
into the stew-pan with the chicken, stir in the brown sauce, 
and let all simmer together until the chicken is cooked. A 
year-old chicken will require two hours. Twelve minutes 
before serving let all boil once. Serve with boiled bacon, 
ham or sausage. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES. 
Cook the chicken until the meat will fall from the 
bones, season as it is being cooked with salt, pepper and a 
small onion and a little mace. Remove the meat, strain 
the gravy, then put the chicken back on the fire ; add cream, 
about one pint, and a good piece of butter, unless the chicken 
is very fat. Boil the gravy, then set away to cool ; when 
the meat is cold cut it very fine, add the gizzard and liver 
cut very fine. Cut the bread thin, spread it with layer of 
meat, then layer of gravy ; roll the bread, and fasten with 
little wooden toothpicks. 

CHICKEN SOUFFLES. 

Take the breast of a chicken, pound it well in the mor- 
tar, press it through a sieve ; to two tablespoonfuls of the 
meat, after it is pounded, add the yolks of two eggs, two 
truftles cut fine, a saltspoonful of salt, a little cayenne and 
a little nutmeg ; mix these well together and add to the mix- 
ture one-fourth pint of whipped cream, and the well-beaten 
whites of three eggs. 

Fill little paper cases, which can be purchased at the 



86 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

confectioners, two-thirds full with the mixture and bake in 
a moderate oven for fifteen minutes ; then serve on a napkin 
on a dish. Tomato or cream sauce can be served with the 
souffle if wished. 

TIMBALES OF CHICKEN. 
To every pound of the breast of an uncooked chicken 
pounded to a smooth paste, add one cup of bread crumbs 
and one-half cup of milk ; cooked together, and add 
this gradually to the chicken meat ; add one teaspoonful 
of salt, a little cayenne and a little nutmeg, then add 
the well-beaten whites of five eggs — put them in very 
gently. Grease the timbale molds or tins, sprinkle on the 
bottom of each a little finely chopped truffle ; steam the tim- 
bales. Be careful not to let any water boil into the tins, by 
covering them with white paper. Steam for twenty min- 
utes and serve with white sauce. 

ROAST GOOSE— I. 
Prepare the goose for roasting, then stuff it with the 
following preparation : Peel, wash and dry a platefuU of 
potatoes ; cut them into small dice. Put into the stew-pan 
one and one-half tablespoonfuls of butter; when hot put in 
the potatoes, one onion minced fine, one garlic clove minced; 
cover the pan ; shake the potatoes to prevent burning, 
steam them until they are half cooked, then take from the 
fire and stir with them the liver of the goose, cut very fine; 
one saltspoonful of salt, one-fourth saltspoonful of pepper, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of powdered sage, one grate of nut- 
meg ; stuff ; or in place of this stuffing use apples cut into 
small pieces and make a rich gravy with the giblets. 
Prunes half stewed, make a very good stuffing ; almonds 
chopped fine and mixed with apples and bread crumbs can 
be used also, 

ROAST GOOSE— 2. 
Take a young, fat goose, chop two onions fine and fry 
them for five minutes in a little butter; mix theonions with 
one pint of mashed potato, one-half teaspoonful of sage, 
one teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper ; stuff the goose 
with this. Roast the goose for two hours, basting fre- 
quently with butter-water. 



POULTRY CIUCKKX, GOOSK, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 87 

Cut six large apples into halves, till a baking pan with 
them, put over them little bits of butter and some powdered 
sugar ; bake until they are soft, then place them around the 
goose and serve. 

Make a gravy by boiling the giblets in one-half pint of 
water. When they are done, chop the gizzard fine, rub the 
liver with one tablespoonful of flour and one-half spoonful 
of butter; stir this into the water in which the giblets were 
boiled until it thickens. Or stuff your goose with apples 
and add two ounces sultana raisins. 

TO RENDER DOWN GOOSE FAT. 

Take all the fat that was removed from the inside of 
the bird when drawing it, or any other superfluous pieces. 
Put all into cold water and leave one day. Change the 
water once or twice. Then drain off the water and cut the 
fat into small pieces, put into a clean stew pan, and slowly 
melt it till nothing but skinny pieces remain and liquid fat. 
Strain it into a jar through a piece of unbleached calico or 
muslin ; when cold cover tightly and keep in a cool place. 

ROAST TAME DUCK. 

The ducks may be stuffed with mashed potatoes and 
onions, with a little sage added or with apples chopped 
fine and seasoned with salt and pepper. Baste the ducks 
very often while roasting. If large, one hour and a half is 
necessary to properly roast them ; ordinary sized ducks, 
about one hour. Serve with a gravy made from the giblets. 

STEAMED DUCK. 
Rub the duck with warm butter ; put into the oven to 
acquire a slightly yellow color ; then put into the stew-pan 
with one carrot sliced, one celery root or three stalks, one 
onion, three cloves, one bay leaf, two sage leaves, one pint 
of water ; lay the duck on these, the breast upward, let it 
steam, closely covered until the vegetables are cooked ; add 
one saltspoonful of salt, and more water if it is needed. 
When the duck is cooked remove from the pan, skim the 
gravy, strain through a sieve, then return it to the pan and 
thicken with one tablespoonful of flour ; boil once and 
serve with the duck. 



88 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CREAMED TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 
Chop fine one quart of cold boiled turkey or chicken ; 
take one pint of fresh white bread crumbs, without crusts ; 
add one-half pint of rich milk and cook together until soft. 
Be sure to stir the mixture constantly that it may not burn. 
When cooked add the turkey or chicken meat, seasoned 
with salt and pepper and a little celery salt. Beat the 
yolks of four eggs until light, add to the preparation, then 
stir in the whites, beaten a little, not too frothy, just 
broken. Butter a mold, put in the mixture and place the 
mold in a pan half full of hot water and bake twenty 
minutes. Turn the mixture from the mold and serve either 
hot or cold ; if hot, serve a white sauce with mushrooms 
added. Serve green peas with the dish. 

BROILED TURKEY. 

For broiling, only a young, half grown turkey is used. 
Split in half, broil over a clear fire for twenty minutes ; 
serve with melted butter, salt and pepper. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Clean, rub with salt, pepper and lemon juice, and stuff 
with oyster or bread stuffing. Really the turkey is better 
without the stuffing, and an oyster sauce is nicer. Crush 
the wings and legs close to the body, pin the fowl in a 
clean cloth, put a little salt in the water, cook slowly, allow- 
ing twenty minutes for each pound. A turkey is nicer 
steamed than boiled, serve with oyster or celery sauce. 

A boiled turkey can be stufl^ed with celery seasoned 
with salt and pepper or with macaroni, which has been 
partially cooked before using in the fowl. 

BREAST OF TURKEY BROILED. 
Cut each breast off" cleanly in one piece, dip into 
melted butter, broil fifteen minutes. Every five minutes 
dip again in melted butter seasoned with salt and pepper ; 
serve with some of the butter poured over each piece. This 
way of cooking a turkey will make it very delicious. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

Stuft' the turkey with bread crumbs seasoned with salt 
and pepper, one tablespoonful of powered thyme and one- 



I'OUI.TRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 89 

half cup of melted butter ; mix well together. Rub the 
turkey well with butter and dredge with flour and a little 
salt ; put in hot oven ; as soon as it is brown reduce the 
heat of the oven, put one pint of hot water and one table- 
spoonful of butter into the pan, and baste with this every 
few minutes, dredging with flour often. 

If chestnut stufHng is desired take one quart of large 
chestnuts, pour over them boiling water to soften the shells, 
remove the shells and the brown skin, boil in salted water 
until tender, mash them (keep a portion for the gravy), add 
to the chestnuts one cup of rolled cracker crumbs, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, one-half cup of melted butter. 
For the gravy remove all the fat from the baking pan, add 
one pint of boiling water, stir in one tablespoonful of flour 
which has been rubbed into one tablespoonful of butter, 
add a little salt and pepper and the remainder of the chest- 
nuts. 

STEWED TURKEY. 

Cut the turkey into nice pieces, put on to cook with 
one quart of water, a few pieces of salt pork, one onion, 
one teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper ; stew gently for 
one and one half hours. Remove the pieces of turkey, 
thicken the gravy with two tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed 
with one tablespoonful of butter. 

MINCED TURKEY. 
Chop very fine the remains of cold turkey. To each 
cupful of meat, add one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of milk or cream, one teaspoonful of flour dissolved 
in the milk, a saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper; let the 
preparation boil once ; put it upon toasted bread and place 
poached eggs on the top if desired. 

STUFFING FOR TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 
Bread crumbs grated fine put into the roasting pan ; 
add salt and pepper and a good large lump of butter ; brown 
on the top of the stove, stirring all the time, then stuff the 
fowl ; the stuffing will be found to be very light and diges- 
tible. Place the fowl in the same pan without washing 
the pan. 



90 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

STUFFING FOR ROAST TURKEY. 

Substitute pork sausage meat for the suet, add one- 
fourth pound of chopped Sultana raisins. 

TO COOK A TURKEY. 

Three hours will cook a ten pound turkey ; it is well to 
have the oven hot at first, then a slower one ; baste fre- 
quently with butter-water. 

BREAD CUPS. 

To fill with creamed sweetbreads, chicken, veal, beef, 
etc. 

Cut slices of bread six inches thick; cut with a deep 
cutter. A half-pound baking tin is nice for this purpose. 
Fry these cups in hot lard until brown then remove the cen- 
ters It is well to make a round mark on the tops of the 
cups before frying. Fll the cups with any of the above 
preparations. Serve at once. 



GAME.

Pick, singe and draw the ducks, slit them down the 
back, crack the bones, flatten the ducks with a cleaver, 
season with a little salt and pepper. Have the gridiron 
hot and greased with a little fat ; have the fire clear — a char- 
coal fire is the best for broiling. Broil for ten minutes. 
Serve very hot with a little butter over them. 

ROAST WILD DUCK (AN OLD VIRGINIARECIPE). 
Mince the livers of a pair of wild ducks with a table- 
spoonful of scraped bacon ; mix with an ounce of butter a 
slice of onion chopped fine, a little salt and cayenne ; fill 
the bodies of the ducks with the mixture ; lay them in a 
baking pan, cover with thin slices of fat bacon, wrap in let- 
ter paper and set in a hot oven. When the ducks are brown 
take them out, garnish with slices of orange and pour over 
them a sauce made by adding the juice of an orange, two 
minced onions, with a teaspoonful of butter, a pinch of 
cayenne, add a little salt to the gravy in the pan. Twenty 
minutes will cook the ducks. 

ROAST DUCK. 
Do not stuff the duck ; have oven very hot and roast 
just twenty minutes, to be in perfection ; the blood should 
follow the knife in carving. Be sure to serve very hot, and 
baste often with melted butter while roasting. 



92 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

GUINEA FOWL. 
One guinea fowl; truss and lard it, roast exactly like 
a pheasant. Put a buttered paper over the breast to prevent

Mince, pound and rub through a sieve the breasts of 
two grouse ; mix with this one-half pint of stiff whipped 
cream, a little salt and pepper. Put the mixture into a 
buttered mold, steam for twenty minutes. Serve with either 
sauce supreme, truffled sauce or mushroom puree. 

ROAST PIGEONS. 
Dry the pigeons, put the heart, liver and gizzard inside 
each bird ; spread some butter over them and dredge them 
with flour ; season with salt and pepper ; place in the stew- 
pan a few slices of salt pork and put in the pigeons, fre- 
quently basting them ; cover and cook for half an hour, 
then remove the pigeons and thicken the gravy with a little 
flour. 

STEWED PIGEONS. 

Take two pigeons, cut off their heads, draw them ; put 

the liver inside the birds. Take one-half pound of salt 

pork, cut it into small square pieces, fry it in the stew-pan 

until light brown, then remove froin the pan ; put the 



GAME. 93 

pigeons into the same pan and fry them until they are

tablespoonful of flour and one-half tablespoonful of butter 
in the stew-pan ; add one pint of broth, season with a little 
salt and pepper, stir on the fire until boiling, then strain ; 
return to the stew-pan the pigeons, the bacon, the broth and 
two onions ; simmer for thirty minutes, then remove the 
pigeons, skim the gravy and strain over the pigeons ; put 
the bacon around them and serve. A pound of fresh niush- 
rooms stewed in the broth is an improvement.

have been shot more than two or three days. Place the bird 
breast downward in well salted water, and see that the 
water covers it ; bring it to a boil and then simmer three- 
quarters of an hour; skim well. Serve with a thick white 
sauce, poured over the bird. Garnish the dish with small 
cooked chestnuts, tomatoes, tufts of fried parsley, and cut 
lemon.

SAUCES AND GARNISHES. 



ALGONQUIN SAUCE FOR CHOPS OR STEAK. 

Two onions chopped fine, three green peppers chopped 
fine ; cook these in one-fourth of a pound of butter ; when 
they are tender, add one pound of fresh mushrooms chopped, 
or one teaspoonful of mushroom catsup ; cook ten minutes 
longer ; then add one claret glassful of sherry and one large 
spoonful of glaze or strong stock, and cook five minutes; 
when ready to serve, sprinkle in one tablespoonfiil of 
parsley chopped fine. 

ANCHOVY vSAUCE— I. 
Prepare some melted butter (see "Melted Butter"), add 
a little cayenne, and add when the sauce is over the fire, a 
teaspoonful of essence of anchovies. 

ANCHOVY SAUCE— 2. 
One tablespoonful of butter, one-half tablespoonfnl of 
flour; mix them well together and add two tablespoonfulo 
of cold water ; put into the saucepan and stir constantly on 
the fire until the sauce thickens and boils; then take from 
the stove and add one and one-half teaspoonfulsof Anchovy 
essence, stir this well and add six drops of Chili vinegar. 

APPLE SAUCE— I. 
Apple sauce should be made in a porcelain lined kettle 
or one of graniteware. To prepaid the apples, peel them 
and cut into pieces, dust a little salt over them ; put into 
the kettle with a little water so that the apples will not 
burn. Cover them up tightly. It will not be necessary to 
stir them if the fire is not too strong. When the apples are 
done for making one quart of the sauce ; put one-half of the 
sauce into the dish in which it is to be served, add two 
tablespoonf uls of sugar, unless the apples are very sour, then 



SAUCES AND (iARNISlIES. 97 

the rest of the apples and then one tablespoonful of sugar, 
one sahspoonful of salt ; cover until served. A small piece 
of butter about the size of a walnut, is liked by many. 

APPLE SAUCE— 2. 
Take half a dozen good-sized apples and throw them 
into cold water, after paring and coreing them. Then put 
them into a saucepan with sufficient water to moisten them, 
and boil till soft enough to pulp. Beat them up, adding a 
little sugar and a small piece of butter and one saltspoonful 
of salt.

water, drain and cool; when cold, place in the ice-box. 
Serve when needed, with a French dressing, or with a 
Mayonnaise dressing. 

SALAD OF JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 

Slice one pint of cold, boiled artichokes and add to 
them one tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, one table- 
spoonful of tarragon vinegar, three tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil, one teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne. Four over the 
artichokes and let the salad stand an hour before serving. 

CALF'S BRAINS AS A SALAD. 

Whiten the brains in cold water ; stew them in a little 
water, with one tablespoonful of vinegar, one onion, three 
cloves, one saltspoonful of salt, three pepper-corns ; simmer

SALADS. 115 

CHICKEN SALAD. 
Boil one chicken until tender. Put in the water one 
onion. When the chicken is cold, cut into small square 
pieces— the salad made of only the white meat is considered 
the finest, but if economy is studied, the dark meat is equally 
good, and the salad liked by man}' more than when made 
with the white meat alone. Take celery, cut it in small 
pieces, add an equal quantity of the chicken — make a mayon- 
naise dressing— mix carefully with the chicken and celery ; 
garnish with lettuce leaves or with the celery leaves. The 
water in which the chicken was boiled should be saved for 
soup. A medium-sized chicken boiled will make enough 
salad for six people. 

SALAD OF CELERIC OR TURNIP-ROOTED 
CELERY. 

Boil the celeric ; when cold, take off the skin, cut it in 
thin slices, dress them with one tablespoonful of vinegar

spoonful of cayenne, one saltspoonful of mustard, one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Mix all well together and then add slowly 
four tablespoonfuls of hot cider vinegar. Put the mixture

half teaspoonful of pepper. Let the dressing stand on the 
potatoes for half an hour before serving. 

POTATO SALAD-2. 
Boil the potatoes in their skins, but be -careful not to 
cook them until they break open ; when cooked let them

SALADS. Iig 

VEGETABLE SALAD. 
Wash carefully one beet, one carrot, one onion, one 
potato, one-half pint of green peas, one-half pint of string 
beans. Cook these until soft in boiling water with one 
teaspoonful of butter and a little salt ; cook the beet separ- 
ately ; when cold peel and slice the vegetables and mix 
them together and pour over all a mayonnaise. Do not put 
the beet with the other vegetables until just before serving; 
dress the salad with lettuce leaves. 

WATERCRESS SALAD. 
Take nice young watercress, cleanse thoroughly in salt

tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a little salt and cayenne. 

WALNUT AND PEAS SALAD. 
If fresh peas are used have them cooked cold and 
carefully drained ; if canned peas are used have them rinsed 
in cold water poured into a colander and drained ; the canned 
peas are already cooked. Shell and blanch the \valnuts by 
letting them remain in boiling water for a few minutes and 
remove the thin brown skin ; this requires time and patience ;

mixture into a bottle and use one tablespoonful for French 
salad dressing with the olive oil. 



120 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 



VEGETABLES. 



Fresh vegetable, especially of the cabbage tribe, should 
be put into fast boiling water ; salt should be added only 
towards the end of the cooking, as its earlier application 
would simply tend to harden the vegetables. 

Potatoes should always be put into boiling water. Do 
not peel potatoes and let them soak for an indefinite time in 
cold water. Never boil potatoes to be served plain before 
you need them ; never try them with a fork ; the fork causes 
them to break and crumble. 

All green vegetables should be cooked in soft water ; 
add a small bit of soda to preserve the green color. Never 
cover green vegetables. 

Garlic is a most excellent condiment. 

Always put vegetables into boiling water ; never have 
the vegetables wait for the meat. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Asparagus of the large or giant variety should be cut 
of exactly equal lengths and boiled standing tops upward in 
a deep saucepan ; nearly two inches of the heads should be 
out of the water, the steam sufficing to cook them, as they 
are the tenderest part of the plant. The stalks can be 
boiled by this method thirty or forty minutes, thus ensuring 
a third more of the asparagus delicious. 

ASPARAGUS CREAMED. 

Cut off the heads of the asparagus ; cook them in 
slightly salted water ; when tender, which will be in about 
twenty minutes, drain off the water and add one cup of 
cream, one-half tablespoonful of butter, one saltspoonful of 
salt, and a little pepper; as soon as the cream is hot, serve 
the asparagus on slices of toast. 



VEGETABLES. 121 

GLOBE ARTICHOKES. 

The ordinary manner of cooking green artichokes is to 
boil them in water ; when tender, drain them and dish them, 
and send melted butter or cream sauce to be eaten with them. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES STEWED. 
Wash the artichokes, cut off the end of each quite flat. 
Boil them in milk and water and lift them out the moment 
they are done ; drain and place them in the dish in which 
they are to be served, and serve them with a rich bechamel 
sauce. 

BEETS. 

Wash free from dirt, but never peel tliem before cook- 
ing. Be careful not to break the skin for if broken the 
beets will bleed. Cook young beets about thirty minutes, 
old beets until they are tender. When cooked peel off the 
skin, slice the beets in thin slices or chop fine, put over 
some melted butter, a little salt and pepper and if liked, 
one tablespoonful of hot vinegar. 

BAKED BANANAS. 

Peel the bananas, place them in a tin pan with three 
teaspoonfuls of cold water and one half teaspoonful of but- 
ter, drop a little lemon juice over each banana, dredge them 
with cinnamon and sugar ; bake for fifteen minutes, or until 
they are easily pierced with a fork. Serve at once. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 
Two quarts of Brussels sprouts, wash them thoroughly, 
put them into three quarts of boiling water with one table- 
spoonful of salt ; boil them gently until they are tender — 
this will be in twenty minutes, shake the pan occasionally, 
then drain them, do not break them; return to the sauce- 
pan, add one-half tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful 
of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of salt, one-fourth saltspoonful 
of pepper; stir over the fire until hot, then serve on hot, 
buttered toast.

simmer away, add one cup of cream or milk, with one table- 
spoonful of flour and two tablespoonfuls of butter mixed 
together. 

LIMA BEANS— 2. 
Boil one pint of lima beans for one hour, then drain 
them, season with a little salt ; keep them hot. Make a 
sauce with one egg beaten light with two tablespoonfuls of 
cold water, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice ; add one table- 
spoonful of butter ; boil these together until the sauce 
thickens, then pour it over the beans and serve hot. 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS. 
Wash the beans and soak them over night in cold 
water ; in the morning put them into cold water and boil 
until soft, then put them into the bean pot with the same 
water, some pepper, one pound of salt pork to one quart of 
beans, one-half cup of molasses. Bake all day ; if the water 
bakes out add more. 

BAKED CABBAGE. 

Put the cabbage into boiling water until the leaves open 
out; clean. Take two slices of boiled ham, chop it very 
fine with a few leaves of the cabbage, add three hard boiled 
eggs, chopped fine, one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful 
of pepper, one teaspoonful of mustard, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter ; mix these together, remove the heart of the 
cabbage and fill in its place the above mixture. Tie up the 
cabbage and put it into boiling water and cook until tender; 
when cooked remove the cloth, put the cabbage on a pan, 
sprinkle over a little flour and one spoonful of melted lard, 
put into the oven and bake until brown. Serve with a 
sauce poured over it; for the sauce, take one tablespoonful 
of butter, melt it in the saucepan, when hot stir in one table- 
spoonful of flour ; as soon as the sauce thickens add two 



VEGETABLES. 1 23 

tablespoonfuls of hot milk ; stir well and pour over the cab- 
bage and then put slices of hard boiled eggs over all. 

BOILED CABBAGE. 

Wash and quarter the cabbage not quite into four 
pieces ; keep it so it will not fall apart. Then have four 
quarts of boiling water and add to it one-half teaspoonful 
of soda, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, boil the cabbage in 
this with the cover on ten minutes, then remove the cover 
and boil twenty minutes. Serve with a sauce as for cauli- 
flower. Cabbage cooked exactly as in this recipe, will be 
found digestible, and there will be no odor in the house from 
the cooking of it. 

CABBAGE WITH BUTTER. 

Boil a cabbage in two quarts of water for an hour, then 
chop it fine, put it into the saucepan with four ounces of 
butter, a little salt and pepper and one teacup of vinegar ; 
let it become very hot, and serve.

124 ^^^ 3"^"5 COOK BOOK. 

CARDOONS BOILED. 
Cut away the coarse outside of the cai-doon, wash it 
free from sand, lay in cold water to harden ; then boil 
in milk and water till tender, drain it on the back of a sieve. 
Cut each stalk in two ; place them in a vegetable dish and 
pour white sauce over them. 

CARROTS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. 
Scrape, wash and scald the carrots in boiling water ; 
cook them in hot water, with salt and a piece of butter the 
size of a small egg. When cooked, remove and put them 
to drain. Mix in a stewpan another piece of butter, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one chopped shallot, one 
teaspoonful of lemon juice, and pepper and salt to taste. 
Put in the carrots, toss them up for two minutes, and serve 
them on fried bread. 

STEWED CARROTS IN THEIR OWN JUICE. 
Wash the carrots very clean, scrape them and cut in 
thick slices, put them in boiling water slightly salted, just 
enough to cover them, boil gently until tender, then boil them 
rapidly to reduce the water ; when only about one table- 
spoonful is left, put with the carrots one-half tablespoonful 
of butter rolled in flour, a little salt and pepper, stir for a 
moment, then add one spoonful of minced parsley, one tea- 
spoonful of cream, and serve at once.

forty-five minutes ; serve it in the same pdn. 

BOILED GREEN CORN. 

Remove the husks and the fine silk from the ears, put 
the corn into boiling water enough to cover it and boil until 
tender — young corn will cook in ten minutes. Take from 
the water, spread a napkin on a dish and put the corn on it ; 
fold over the napkin and serve at once. 



VEGETABLES. 1 25 

CREAMED CORN. 

Cut the corn from the cob, cut only the outer part of the 
grain, then scrape the cob clean ; cook the first part in a little 
milk for forty minutes, add the part scraped from the cob, 
and cook together for five minutes ; season with one table- 
spoonful of butter, a little salt and pepper. 

GREEN CORN CAKE. 
Cut the grains from the corn cob, then scrape the cob 
well, add one tablespoonful of melted butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour, salt and pepper. Have the frying pan 
hot and lightly greased with butter, pile the corn on it, 
brown, then turn it over and brown the other side. 

GREEN CORN CAKES. 
Grate the corn, scrape well the cob. For twelve ears 
take three eggs, beat them well and add to the corn one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Mix well together and fry like griddle 
cakes. These cakes will be found very delicate. Serve with 
meat. 

ESCALLOFED CORN. 
One can of corn or one pint fresh corn, season highly ; 
add one egg, two spoonfulsof cream; place in baking dish, 
cover with cracker crumbs and bits of butter. Bake ten 
minutes, just to brown nicely for luncheon. The corn, if 
fresh, must first be boiled until tender. 

CORN PUDDING. 
Scrape with a knife two dozen ears of corn, cut the 
grains and then scrape the cobs well. Melt one-half pound 
of butter; stir into the corn and add one pint of milk, the 
yolks of three eggs well beaten, one teaspoonfulof salt, one 
saltspoonful of pepper, then add the whites beaten stiff. 
Pour the mixture into a baking dish and bake in a moderate 
oven for one hour and a quarter unless the corn is old, when 
a longer time will be necessary. 

CORN FRITTERS. 
One pint of corn, either fresh or canned. Make a 
batter of four eggs, one cup of milk, one teaspoonful of 
baking powder, one cup of flour, one teaspoonful of salt; 



126 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

mix these well together until light. Have the fat deep and 
boiling, then drop the mixture in spoonfuls into it and fry 
until the fritters are a light brown. 

STEWED CELERY. 

Take the outer stalks of celery, cut in pieces two inches 
in length, boil in milk until tender, add a little salt and 
pepper ; when cooked drain from the milk, put into the milk 
one teaspoonful of butter and one teaspoonful of flour mixed 
together, stir until the milk thickens and then pour over the 
celery. 

CAULIFLOWERS BOILED. 

Choose white, firm and small grained cauliflowers; 
trim off the leaves and stalk ; wash them well in cold water, 
in which put one tablespoonful of vinegar— by using this, 
any insect in the cauliflower will be sure to come out. Put 
the cauliflower in boiling water for five minutes, remove, 
cool and drain, then boil again in two quarts of water with 
one teaspoonful of salt. You can tell if the cauliflower is 
done, if when you pinch a small piece, it is tender, though 
still firm. Serve with a white sauce, or sauce for cauli- 
flower. 

CAULIFLOWER WITH CHEESE. 

Cook the cauliflower in salted water ; when tender, 
drain from the water, put into a porcelain dish which will 
stand the heat of the oven; cover with white sauce, then 
put two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese over it and some 
fine bread crumbs and bits of butter ; when brown, serve 
hot. 

CUCUMBERS. 

It is a mistake to soak cucumbers in salted water to 
draw out the indigestible part ; it surely renders them un- 
palatable and wilts them. To prepare the cucumber prop- 
erly is to cut off the rind, then cut the cucumber into thin 
slices and place them in an earthern bowl with ice-water. 
Let them stand at least one hour before serving, they will 
then be crisp and the poisonous substance (to some) will be 
extracted. 



VEGETABLES. 1 37 

CUCUMBERS FRIED. 
Peel the cucumbers, cut in slices one-fourth of an inch 
in thickness, dip each slice in beaten egg and then into 
bread crumbs or into flour ; fry brown the same as egg plant. 

CUCUMBERS-FOR FISH. 
Peel the cucumbers, then place in water for one hour, 
grate them, removing first the seeds, add to the pulp a 
French salad dressing ; this preparation of cucumbers is 
very nice served with fish. 

DRESSED CUCUMBERS. 
Take cucumbers, pare and chop them into small 
pieces. Take half the quantity of young onions and cut 
them fine ; add one tablespoonful of lemon juice, a trifle of 
cayenne, and a glass of sherry or Madeira and a dessert- 
spoonful of Chili vinegar. This is very good with any 
roast meat. 

FRIED EGG PLANT. 

Cut the egg plant into slices one-fifth of an inch in 
thickness, sprinkle them with salt, pile them on each other 
and place a weight on the top ; leave them for three hours, 
then rinse and dry the slices, dip them into beaten egg and 
then into flour, fry them in hot lard ; serve hot. 

STUFFED EGG PLANT-i. 
Wash and dry one large egg plant, cut oflf the top like 
a lid; scoop out the inside of the egg plant, season it with 
salt and pepper ; take one onion, peel and chop it very fine, 
put it into the saucepan with one tablespoonful of butter, 
cook these together for five minutes, do not brown ; add a 
few tnushrooms chopped fine, one ounce of sausage meat ;

plant, dip it in egg then in bread crumbs, and bake in the 
oven until it is browned. 

KOHLRABI OR CABBAGE TURNIP. 
Peel the turnips, cut them into small pieces, boil them 
until tender in salted water ; boil the green leaves of the 
tops, and when they are done, strain and chop them fine 
like spinach and return to the stewpan with a little butter, 
season with salt and pepper. Put the turnips into the center 
of a dish, pour over a little melted butter, dish the greens 
around the turnips and serve hot. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS. 
Toast for each person a slice of bread and spread over 
it some cream. Lay on each slice of toast, with the head 
down, one mushroom, if large ; if small, two or three mush- 
rooms ; fill in each cup with as much cream as it will hold, 
with a bit of butter and a little salt and pepper. Place over 
the dish a closely-fitting cover ; the mushrooms should be in 
a shallow dish. Bake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes ; 
do not remove the cover until just before serving. Serve in 
the same dish, if possible, in which the mushrooms are 
baked. 

MUSHROOMS WITH BUTTER. 
Cut the stems from the mushrooms, clean them with a 
piece of flannel and some salt ; if necessary to wash them, dry 
thoroughly after. To one part of mushrooms put one and 
one-half tablespoonfuls of butter into the saucepan ; when 
hot put in the mushrooms and siiake them in the butter until 
they begin to brown ; in five minutes add one saltspoonful 
of salt and a little pepper, stew them until tender, remove 
from the pan and serve on hot toast. If any butter remains 
in the stewpan, put it into a small cup and keep for a steak 
or some chops the next day ; it will have a delicious flavor. 

MUSHROOMS STEWED— I. 

Take two tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half teaspoonful 

of pepper, one fourth teaspoonful of cayenne. Mix together 

into a paste, put in saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter; 

when it is hot put in the mushrooms which have been 



VEGETABLES. 1 29 

peeled, place on each mushroom a little of the paste ; as 
soon as a brown sauce comes from the mushrooms, they are 
cooked and should be served at once on hot toast. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS— 2. 
Cut off the stems and boil in a cup of beef stock for 
twenty minutes and strain. Take one quart of mushrooms 
and strip off the skins, put into the stock and stew gently, 
add one-half cup of cream, one teaspoonful of butter, and 
thicken with a little flour, salt and pepper. Cook all about 
half an hour. 

ONIONS.

and parboil it ; fill the centre with forcemeat and place it in 
a stew-pan ; cover it with slices of bacon, sprinkle with salt 
and sugar and cook over a quick fire. When done, remove 
the onions, reduce the sauce and pour it over them and serve.

v^^ater and let them Jjoil until soft, then drain off the water 
and put with the peas a piece of butter the size of an egg, a 
chopped onion, a little salt and pepper, and stew until the 
onion is cooked, then serve. 

GREEN PEPPER CROQUETTES. 
Select good-sized, firm sweet peppers, wash them, cut 
a small liole at the stem and remove all the seeds, then put 
the peppers in a stew-pan in a little boiling water to par- 
boil them, remove and let them cool. Stuff each pepper 
with a forcemeat, made with cold chicken, veal or sweet- 
breads minced fine and mixed with some bread crumbs, and 
seasoned with a little salt and a few drops of onion juice.

a knife scrape and peel them, cut them open, remove the 
seeds, rinse in cold water, drain them and pack into glass 
jars, pour boiling vinegar over them and a little salt, and 
seal. 

BOILED POTATOES. 
Potatoes should be very carefully boiled ; and if not 
used as soon as they are done, should be kept hot and dry, 
by pouring off the water, covering them with a dry cloth, 
and setting them on the back of the stove. After washing 
them thoroughly, pare them entirely, or take oft" one ring 
around each ; if they are new put them over the fire in hot 
water ; if they are old, put them on in cold water ; in either 
case, add a tablespoonful of salt, and boil them from fifteen 



VEGETABLES. I33 

to thirty minutes, as they require, until you can pierce 
them easily with a fork, then drain off the water, cover 
them with a clean, dry towel, and set them on the back of 
the fire until you are ready to use them. 

POTATOES A L'ANNA. 
Cut up some raw potatoes very fine, put them in cold 
water for six hours, then drain them, season with salt and 
pepper, put them into a well-buttered dish, sprinkle bread 
crumbs on top, add enough melted butter to cover them ; 
bake in a very hot oven for one-half hour or until they are 
well browned. If baked in a porcelain dish they can be 
served in it, a folded napkin being put around the dish, or 
they can be put on a hot dish. 

POTATO BALLS. 
Boil four large potatoes ; when hot mash and add to 
them one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one egg well 
beaten, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
pepper, a little grated nutmeg and a little cayenne. Mix 
these well together and roll into balls, dip them in beaten 
egg, then into fine bread or cracker crumbs ; be sure the 
crumbs are fine, and fry in deep boiling fat ; drain from the 
fat and keep hot until served. 

BAKED POTATOES. 
Choose large and smooth potatoes, put them in the 
oven ; when they are half done take each one in a kitchen 
towel and press it hard ; return to oven ; bake one hour. 

COLD BOILED POTATOES. 
All potatoes that are intended to be boiled and then 
made into different preparations should be boiled in, their 
skins and not quite cooked ; set away and allowed to get cold 
in their skins. This plan makes a great dift'erence in the 
successful preparation of potatoes, and should be followed. 

POTATOES CADEAU. 

Boil four large Irish potatoes in their skins and let 

them become cold ; it is best to boil them the day before 

using; grate the potatoes, add one egg beaten until light, 

one tablespoonful of flour, a little salt. Make the mixture 



134 TIIE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

into balls and roll them in flour. Have two kettles on the 
stove, one half full of boiling water, the other with boiling 
lard ; put the balls first into the boiling water, as soon as 
they rise on the surface, take from the water and drop into 
the lard, as soon as the balls are brown they are cooked. 

POTATOES WITH CHOCOLATE. 
Slice the cooked potatoes, put a layer of potatoes in a 
porcelain dish, which you can serve them in ; then a layer 
of sugar and butter, then a layer of potatoes, then a little 
more sugar and butter, then one tablespoonful grated 
chocolate dissolved in one cup of milk ; pour this over the 
potatoes and bake for twenty minutes. 

CREAMED POTATOES.

POTATO CROQUETTES. 

Take two cups of mashed potatoes, add to them a few 
drops of onion juice, the yolks of two eggs well beaten, one 
teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of cream, one table-

ents well together in the saucepan ; when hot remove from 
the fire and let the mixture cool ; when cold form into balls, 
dip these first into beaten eggs, then into very fine cracker 
or bread crumbs ; see that the balls are smooth, place in the 



VEGETABLES. I35 

ice-box for an hour or more. When required h-y them in 
very hot deep fat. It is best to use the frying basket ; when 
the balls are of a brown color drain from the fat on brown 
paper. Keep them hot until served. 

POTATOES CRUMBED. 
Peel and boil the potatoes ; when they are cooked but 
not broken, split them in halves, season with salt and 
pepper, pour over them some melted butter, then dip each 
piece in browned bread crumbs, place them in a buttered 
tin and bake for fifteen minutes in a hot oven. 

ESCALLOPED POTATOES. 
Pare, wash and slice enough potatoes to nearly fill the 
baking dish ; season the potatoes with salt and pepper ; 
add little bits of butter all through the dish, then pour over 
the potatoes enough milk, or better, cream, to fill up the 
dish ; put one tablespoonful of butter on top of the dish ; 
bake. Keep the dish covered until the potatoes are nearly 
done, then uncover and let them brown. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 
Peel the potatoes, cut them in narrow strips, soak in 
ice water one hour, drain and dry, have ready a kettle of 
deep lard ; when boiling drop in the potatoes a few at a 
time and let them brown, sprinkle salt over them when 
they are removed from the fat, drain on wire dish or on 
filtering paper; serve in a hot dish. 

FRIED POTATOES— I. 

Take six good potatoes, peel and slice them about 
one-fourth of an inch in thickness. Have two pans of fat, 
either clarified beef suet or lard ; cook the potatoes in one 
for a few minutes, then remove them with a skimmer and 
put them into the other pan ; the fats must be very hot. The 
potatoes will swell and be much lighter from the double 
frying. 

FRIED POTATOES— 2. 

Peel the potatoes, slice them lengthwise about one- 
eighth of an inch thick, place in cold water for a few 
minutes, then drain and fry them in hot fat for six minutes, 



136 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

remove from the fat, let them cool. Keep the Sat hot (it 
must be deep fat), and just before serving the potatoes 
plunge them into the boiling fat for five minutes ; this will 
cause them to swell ; then remove from the fat, drain them, 
sprinkle with salt and serve at once. 

POTATOES FRIED WITH PARSLEY. 

One pound of potatoes, two ounces of butter, two tea- 
spoonfuls of chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Scrape and 
boil the potatoes ; let them get cold. Put the butter into 
the frying pan ; when melted put in the potatoes and fry a 
pale gold ; add the parsley about five minutes before serving ; 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. 

HASHED BROWN POTATOES. 

Six potatoes cut fine. Take two tablespoonfuls of 
onions cut fine and one tablespoonful of parsley chopped 
fine ; put these into hot lard and fry them ; as soon as the 
onions commence to brown add the potatoes, stirring all 
together; press the mixture down on the pan, let it brown, 
then stir again, so as to mix the crust well; when the 
potatoes are well mixed with the crust add one tablespoon- 
ful of butter ; press the potatoes well on the pan so that 
they will have a good brown crust ; turn them out on a 
platter, the crust side up. 

POTATO KLOSSE. 

Take about six baked potatoes and scoop out the floury 
part till there are about six ounces. Beat one tablespoonful 
of butter to a cream and mix it with the potato flour ; add 
the well beaten yolks of two eggs, a grate of nutmeg and a 
little pepper and salt to taste. Beat the mixture thoroughly 
and mold it into small balls. Drop these in boiling salt 
and water, and be careful to do this with a metal spoon, 
and to dip it into boiling water each time it is used. Or 
they may be made with two ounces of finely-grated bread 
crumbs and one ounce of Parmesan, the white of one of the 
eggs, then molded and boiled as above. Sprinkle fried 
bread crumbs over when dishing them up.

mashed potatoes and mix them with some finely chopped 
onions, a little pepper and salt ; beat these well and add one 
tablespoonful of melted butter. Make into little loaves and 
place in the pan with the roast of beef ; the gravy from the 
beef gives a very good flavor to the potato loaves. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES, 
Two tablespoonfuls of good beef dripping or butter 
made very hot in the frying pan, when hot add one table- 
spoonful of minced onion ; let this fry until brown, and then

pepper and salt; two eggs, dried crumbs, one-fourth pint of 
milk. Boil your potatoes in their skins, skin them and 
mash them with the butter; add the seasoning and milk. 
Make into balls, brush over with yolk of egg and crumbs. 
Fry three minutes in boiling fat in a frying basket. 

SARATOGA POTATOES. 

Slice three potatoes as thin as possible, throw them into 
a bowl of ice-water, keep them in the ice-water for two or 
three hours. When ready to use the potatoes, have the 
kettle of fat very hot ; you must have deep fat, at least four 
inches deep. Dry the potatoes by putting a few at a time 
in a clean coarse towel, drop them into the boiling fat, a 
few at a time. Stir, to prevent them from sticking to- 
gether. The moment they are of a light yellow color 
remove with the skimmer ; drain on brown paper. These 
potatoes should never be greasy, and they will not be if the 
fat is at the right temperature and care is used. 

POTATO SNOW. 
Have some very mealy potatoes ; boil ; when cooked 
drain and keep them hot ; heat the colander and pass 



VEGETABLES. 139

the back of the range for two hours ; if the cream or milk 
cooks into the potatoes, leaving them dry, add some more. 
Serve hot. 

STEWED POTATOES— 2. 
Boil the potatoes in their skins ; when almost cooked 
remove from the fire ; when cold peel them and cut into

VEGETABLES. I4I 

well in two waters and be sure you have removed all sand ; 
cut off the roots and stems, drain the leaves, put them into a 
large kettle containing one quart of boiling water and one 
tablespoonful of salt; toss and turn the leaves for ten min- 
utes ; remove from the pot, drain them in a colander ; when 
dry, chop them very fine, or press them through a coarse 
sieve ; put the mixture into a saucepan with one table- 
spoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of cream, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, a little pepper; stir constantly until very 
hot and serve ; put sliced hard-boiled eggs on top.

salt and pepper ; when the sauce has thickened, serve hot. 

SALSIFY BOILED-2. 

One bundle of salsify, one-half pint of cream, pepper 
and salt, one lemon, one ounce of butter. Scrape the roots 
very gently to get off the outer skin and quickly throw 
them into vinegar and water or they will become black. 
Boil them in enough water to cover them ; drain, add the

TO PICKLE SAUER KRAUT. 

Select firm, white cabbages, leave out the outer leaves 
and stalks, begin at the top of the head to cut across in 
narrow strips using a large knife ; have a small oak barrel 
or pickling jar or tub, cover the bottom with clean cabbage 
leaves, throw in the cabbage as fast as it is shredded, sprinkle 
with salt ; stamp it down hard with a club ; when all is 
closely packed, strew more salt on top, cover with some 
cabbage leaves and then with a clean linen cloth. Put on 
a cover that will fit closely and on this a heavy stone. 

Do not put the kraut in too cool a place or fermentation 
will not begin. When it has begun small white globules 
will form on the brine, which should appear in two or three 
days ; if they do not, boil some salt and water, cool and 
pour over the cabbage. 

A large handful of salt is enough for a firkin of cut 
cabbage ; too much salt prevents fermentation. In two 
weeks the cloth over the kraut must be taken off and wash- 
ed and the leaves renewed, then cover again — the washing 
of the cloth must be done every week. 

In three weeks it will be ready for use, and will keep 
good for a year. 

SAUER KRAUT COOKED. 

One tablespoonful of butter ; melt this in a saucepan, 
then put in half as much sauer kraut as needed, and a piece 
of pork, bacon, ham or sausage ; lay over this the rest of the 
kraut, but in a glass of vinegar, a little water ; cover all 
closely and stew gently until the kraut is soft and yellow. 
Remove the meat when it is done ; dredge in a little flour ; 
cook one-half hour longer ; put back the meat to heat thor-

RICE, ETC. 147 



RICE, ETC. 



TO BOIL RICE. 

One quart of water with one teaspoonful of salt. When 
boiling hard, put in one pint of well-washed rice. As soon 
as the water boils hard again, remove to the back of the 
range and let the rice cook slowly ; when all the water is 
boiled away, cover the rice until it is perfectly cooked, do 
not stir at all — be careful not to burn the rice. 

The addition of a little lemon juice to the water in 
which rice is boiled will increase the whiteness, and the 
grains will readily separate. 

RICE CROQUETTES WITH MEAT. 

Boil the rice until quite soft and tender; while warm 
add an egg well beaten, a teaspoonful of butter, and salt to 
taste, and half a teacupful of any kind of cold meat, ham or 
tongue, chopped fine. When cold, make into croquettes, 
cover with beaten egg and bread crumbs, and fry in hot 
dripping-pan till browned. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

One-fourth pound of rice well-washed and dried, one 
pint of milk ; boil them together until the rice is perfectly 
tender. A thin rind of lemon cooked with the rice is an 
addition. When the rice is rather dry and tender add one 
tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of butter, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little pepper and a little nutmeg. Stir 
together and spread on a dish to cool ; when cold form into 
croquettes ; dip each one in beaten egg, then into fine 
crumbs, either of bread or crackers; put on the ice for an 
hour or more, then fry in deep hot fat until a light brown 
color, and serve at once. 



148 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

RICE CROQUETTES WITH JAM.

oil, one quart of stock. Cut the onion fine, cook well in the 
butter and oil until of a golden color, mix it in the rice, add 
the wine, then one-half the stock (one pint), add the rest of 
the stock, a little at a time until the rice is done and the 
mixture thickens— it must boil fast and hard ; when almost 
done, add the saffron and last the cheese; after removing it 
from the stove add a piece of butter. The Risotto should 
be a trifle thicker than a puree. 

RICE CASSEROLE. 
Wash two pounds of rice in water twice; drain and 
put into a stewpan with two quarts of water, one salt- 
spoonful of salt ; when the water boils, cover the rice with 
some thin slices of salt pork and let it simmer slowly until

until the rice is tender, then add two tablespoonfuls of 
blanched almonds chopped fine. Put the rice mixture into 
shallow dishes and shake until the surface is smooth, then 
sift over thickl}' some powdered cinnamon, which will give 
it the appearance of a freshly baked cake. Serve cold. It 
will remain good for several days. If desired richer, one- 
third cream may be used in the place of the milk.

CHEESE PREPARATIONS. 



CHEESE. 

Cheese is regarded as a most important article of food ; 
it contains more nutritious material than any other food that 
is ordinarily obtainable. Mr. W. Matthieu Williams, in 
his " Chemistry of Cookery," says : " All that is required to 
render it, next to bread, the staple food of the world, is 
scientific cookery." Mr. Williams advises the use of a very 
little bicarbonate of potash in all cheese dishes. 

AIGRETTES OF PARMESAN. 
One-fourth pint of water, two ounces of butter, two 
ounces of flour, two ounces of grated cheese (Parmesan), 
two eggs, one-fourth ounce pepper and salt. Put the water 
into the saucepan with the butter, let it boil, shake in the 
flour, cook well ; add the cheese, the eggs, well beaten, one 
at a time. Have ready some boiling fat and drop in about 
a dessert-spoonful of the mixture at a time ; fry a golden 
brown, and serve very hot. 

CHEESE BALLS. 
Two cups of grated cheese, the whites of two eggs 
beaten very light, one tablespoonful of cream, one saltspoon- 
ful of salt, a little cayenne, five drops of Worcestershire 
sauce. Mix all these together, then make into small balls, 
dip them in beaten egg and fine bread crumbs ; fry in hot 
deep lard. 

CHEESELETS.

served — a small silver dish or a French porcelain one is 
suitable. Mix one tablespoonful of butter and one table- 
spoonful of flour in the saucepan, stir until they bubble, 
then add one gill of rich milk ; this will make a thick white 
sauce; stir constantly to prevent burning ; when smooth, 
stir into the sauce three tablespoonfuls of grated cheese 
(good York State cheese), one small saltspoonful of salt, a 
little cayenne. Turn the mixture into a bowl, stir in the 
well-beaten yolks of two eggs ; whip the whites of three 
eggs very stiff and stir them in very gently at the last. 
Butter the dish in which the fondue is to be baked; the 
fondue must half fill it. Bake until it is a golden brown in 
hot oven. Serve at once. 

CHEESE FONDUE— 2. 

One cup of bread crumbs fine and dry, two cups of 
milk, one-half pound of cheese grated, three eggs, whipped

into the milk. Soak the crumbs in the milk, beat the eggs 
and stir into the crumbs and milk, then add the cheese. 
Butter the baking dish, pour the mixture into it, strew some 
dry crumbs on the top, and bake in a hot oven. 

A very little soda should be put in all cheese prepara- 
tions.

EGGS, 



Eggs contain all that is required for the building up of 
the body. 

EGG BALLS. 
Boil four eggs until they are hard, then put into cold 
water for a little while, remove the shells and take the yolks, 
pound them smooth, add one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of pepper, a little cayenne and one yolk of raw 
egg. Make the mixture into small balls, roll them in flour, 
fry them with a little butter until they are a delicate brown ; 
serve with mock turtle soup or other soups. 

BAKED EGGS— I. 
Put some good gravy into a shallow baking dish. 
Break four eggs or as many as are required into this, salt 
them, and sprinkle some bread crumbs over them, and bake 
for five minutes in a quick oven. Take up the eggs care- 
fully one by one, and lay upon little rounds of fried bread. 
Add to the gravy a little cream and some very finely chopped 
parsley and onion ; put into a saucepan and boil up quickly 
and pour over the eggs. 

BAKED EGGS— 3. 

Spread a thick layer of fresh butter on a tin or fireproof 
china dish, sprinkle with salt, and break the eggs carefully 
onto it, one at a time; pour some cream over them, season 
with salt, pepper and one grate of nutmeg; place a few 
small lumps of butter over all, bake in the oven for four 
minutes. 

BAKED EGGS— 3. 
Boil eggs until hard, then put them into cold water ; 
when cold remove the shells, chop the eggs very fine, add 
one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper; stir 



EGGS. l6l 

together ; put the eggs into a porcelain dish ; first put a layer 
of breadcrumbs, then a layer of the eggs, then bread crumbs, 
eggs, or until the dish is full ; then put bits of butter over 
the top with some bread crumbs; lastly pour over all one 
cup of cream ; bake fifteen minutes. 

EGGS AND CHEESE. 
Take the small china dishes that will stand the heat ; 
place in each a bit of butter, a little chopped parsley, break 
over a fresh egg, sprinkle on the top of theegg some grated 
cheese — American cheese is excellent for this, a few bread 
crumbs and a little salt and pepper ; bake in a hot oven for 
three minutes, and serve in the same dish in which they 
are baked. 

EGGS WITH CREAM— I. 

Poach eggs in boiling water, allowing one for each 
person to be served ; trim them and dish on a slice of bread ; 
pour over some hot cream sauce ; sprinkle some chopped 
parsley or truffles over, and place around the eggs slices of 
hot, fried bacon cut thin and rolled. 

EGGS WITH CREAM— 2. 
Cover the bottom of a porcelain plate with cream ; 
break on this the eggs carefully; let them bake for four 
minutes ; sprinkle a little salt and pepper and a bit of butter 
on each egg, and serve in the same dish in which they are 
baked. 

EGG CROQJLIETTES. 
One ounce of butter, one pint of flour, one pint of boil- 
ing water, five eggs. Mix the flour with the water in a 
saucepan ; when well cooked take it off the fire and cool the 
mixture ; when cold add the eggs one by one, beat the batter 
very hard before the eggs are put in, and after, drop the 
batter in little bits like eggs, into deep boiling lard. 

DEVILLED EGGS. 

Take as many eggs as there are persons to be served ; 
break them into the saucepan and fry them until the whites 
are firm ; be careful not to break the yolks ; trim the eggs 
nicely and place them on a hot dish ; pour over them this 



162 THE 3-6-5 COOK HOOK. 

sauce, which should be ready at the same time the eggs 
are to be served. Put into a stewpan one tablespoonful of 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of cream, a little cayenne, one 
saltspoonful of salt, one teaspoonfulof French mustard, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of English mustard, one tablespooonful 
of tomato catsup, the yolks of two raw eggs. Stir together 
on the fire until the sauce thickens, add one tablespoonful 
of finely minced cold ham, and one green pepper cut very 
fine (if convenient); serve. 

FRIED EGGS— I. 

When the frying pan is hot put in a little butter, then 
place the pan on a cooler part of the stove, break into the 
pan, one at a time, the eggs ; if the eggs are put into the pan 
when it is very hot they they will burst and crack. 

FRIED EGGS— 2. 

One tablespoonful of olive oil, put into the saucepan ; 
when hot, drop gently into it the eggs. As soon as the eggs 
are cooked, carefully remove from the oil ; the whites should 
have a yellow edge. It is very necessary that the eggs for 
frying should be most carefully put into the pan so as not to 
break the yolks. In place of the oil, butter can be used. 
Serve very hot ; sprinkle over the yolks a litttle salt and 
pepper. 

EGGS IN A NEST. 

Toast some slices of bread a dainty brown and pare off 
the crust, leaving an oval of toast; on this put a big tea- 
spoonful of white of egg beaten to a stiff froth ; drop the 
yolk in the center, with pepper, salt and a tiny bit of butter, 
and set in the oven until it becomes a golden brown. 

EGGS ON THE PLATE. 

Rub the plate well with butter, sprinkle a little salt 
and pepper over, then break the eggs carefully ; do not break 
the yolks ; put bits of butter on the eggs, and put one spoon- 
ful of cream for each egg ; put the plate on a tin containing 
a little hot water, and stand in the oven for five minutes, 
and serve hot 



EGCJS. 163 

POACHED EGGS. 

A wide and shallow pan is the best for poaching eggs 
in ; half fill the pan with boiling water slightly salted ; break 
the eggs carefully into a saucer separately and slide them 
into the water; let them simmer for two minutes, then let 
the water boil for another minute ; this detaches the eggs 
from the pan ; then remove the eggs with a pancake turner; 
place them on slices of hot toast or on minced meat or fish. 

Eggs can be poached in milk ; all eggs for poaching 
must be perfectly fresh. 

Three drops of Worcestershire sauce on each egg just 
before it is quite cooked, is a great addition to a poached egg. 

POACHED EGGS WITH ANCHOVY PAvSTE. 
Make six slices of toast, butter and spread over them 
some anchovy paste and place in the oven for a few 
minutes. Poach six eggs and place an egg on each piece of 
toast, add a very little salt and pepper to each top and serve 
very hot. 

PLAIN OMELETTE. 
Beat three eggs lightly with a little salt and pepper, 
add three tablespoonfuls of hot water. Put a little butter in 
the omelette pan ; when hot, pour in the eggs, stir continu- 
ally with a fork so that all may cook evenly; the omelette 
must cook quickly ; when the eggs are set, run the knife 
under the omelette which is nearest the handle of the pan ; 
turn this half over on the other half; take a hot plate and 
place it on the edge of the pan and flop the omelette on to it 
This is a plain omelette ; all other varieties are made by 
adding the ingredients after the eggs are put into the pan. 

OMELETTE CELESTINE. 
One-half a pint of milk, boil with it two tablespoonfuls 
of rice flour, four ounces of sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla 
extract, simmer for ten minutes, stirring constantly, add 
then the yolks of three eggs mixed with a little milk, and 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, then add the whites beaten 
light, and divide the mixture, making two omelettes; put 
one-half in the pan, having a little hot butter in the pan ; 
when the omelette is ready to fold, put over it one table- 
spoonful of marmalade, fold over the omelette and serve hot. 



164 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

SPANISH OMELETTE. 

One large tomato cut in pieces, one small green pepper 
cut in pieces, one small onion sliced, one teaspoonful of 
parsley chopped fine, one teaspoonful of celery chopped fine, 
half a can of mushrooms cut in pieces. Cook these together 
for a few minutes, then put with the omelette when it^is in 
the pan. 

ORANGE OMELETTE. 

For three eggs use the thinly-grated rind of one orange 
and three tablespoonfuls of the juice. Beat the yolks until 
light, add three tablespoonfuls of fine sugar, then the juice 
and rind of the orange ; beat the whites of the eggs until 
light, fold them in the mixture and then all into an omelette 
pan, cook until set, then place in a moderate oven and lightly 
brown. Serve on a hot dish. 

vSTUFFED EGGS. 
Boil as many eggs as you require until they are hard; 
put them in cold water, when cold remove the shells, cut 
the eggs in halves; cut with a warm, sharp knife; remove 
the yolks, mash them into a smooth paste, with one table- 
spoonful of olive oil, or two tablespoonfuls of melted butter ; 
one saltspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of cayenne, 
one-fourth saltspoonful of mustard. Mix these all together 
until smooth, then fill in the eggs and press the two halves 
together; place upon a bed of lettuce leaves. If desired, a 
mayonnaise sauce can be poured over the eggs. 

SCOTCH EGGS. 
Boil one-half dozen eggs twenty minutes and then drop 
them into cold water. Chop very fine, enough lean cooked 
ham to make one cupful. Cook one-third of a cup of stale 
bread crumbs in the same amount of milk and stir until it is 
a smooth paste. Take it from the fire and mix the prepared 
ham with the paste. Add half a teaspoonful of made 
mustard and half a saltspoonful of paprika ; lastly stir in a 
beaten egg and mix well. Remove the shells from the 
boiled eggs and cover the eggs with a thick coating of this 
mixture. With a spoon cover the outside of this mixture 
with a partly beaten egg and then roll them in fine bread 
crumbs. Lay the prepared eggs in a frying basket and put 



EGGS. 165 

them in a cold place untiT required ; then fry them in hot 
lard to a nice brown and let them drain on brown paper in 
the mouth of the oven, where they will remain hot. Cut 
some rather thin slices of bread and with a biscuit cutter 
make them into round pieces. Toast and butter these slices 
of bread and lay them on a hot platter. With a sharp 
knife cut each egg into halves lengthwise and lay them upon 
the toast with the cut side down. Garnish the dish with 
watercresses and serve them with the eggs. A bechamel 
or cream sauce is often served with the eggs in place of the 
cresses. 

SWISS EGGS. 

vSpread two ounces of butter on a dish, and lay on it 
six thin slices of Swiss cheese ; break six eggs upon this, 
keeping the yolks whole. Sprinkle over some salt and 
pepper. Mix a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and two 
ounces of grated Swiss cheese together and strew over them. 
Bake in a very quick oven for about five minutes. 

EGGS A LA TRIPE. 

Allow one egg to each person to be served. Boil them 
for eight minutes, then slice them, using a warm, wet knife 
for the purpose. Butter a porcelain dish, put in the bottom 
a layer of cream sauce, then a layer of the sliced eggs, 
sprinkle over them a little finely chopped onion or shallot, 
some chopped parsley ; continue these layers until the dish 
is full, having the cream sauce for the last layer, put over 
some fine bread crumbs and some bits of butter. Place the 
dish in a tin half filled with boiling water and put into the 
oven for fifteen minutes, then take from the oven, sprinkle 
over the top some hard-boiled yolk of egg, which has been 
passed through a fine sieve, and serve.

SAVORIES. 



Savories are served with the salad course at dinner or 
at luncheon. 

SAVORIES. 

(anchovies.) 
Take two hard boiled eggs, mash the yolks with one 
saltspoonful of salt, two mustard spoonfuls of French mus- 
tard ; rub the whole together, then add slowly two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon 
vinegar, stir all one way until all are blended smoothly, then 
add two filletted anchovies, which have been well pounded ; 
lastly add one-half gill of whipped cream and spread the 
mixture on thinly cut brown bread. 

ANCHOVY STRAWS. 

Take "anchovies in oil," dry them and cut into long, 
thin strips; roll each strip in pastry and fry in deep, hot 
fat ; pile them two by two over each other and serve hot. 

ANCHOVY TOAST. 

Toast thin slices of bread, butter them and spread over 
some anchovy paste ; serve hot. 

A SAVORY WITH BACON. 

Among the many excellent ways of serving bacon the 
following is one of the best. The bacon may be prepared 
and can be easily cooked the last moment over the lire in a 
frying pan ; or if desired it may be cooked upon the table in 
a chafing dish. Skin and bone some sardines ; add to them 
some paprika, a little chopped parsley (or lemon juice may 
be used in place of parsley), and some butter. Rub these 
ingredients together, making them into a smooth paste. 
Spread this paste upon thin slices of bacon and roll each 



SAVORIES. 167

toothpick. Lay the prepared slices in a hot frying pan and 
cook quickly. Serve very hot. 

CAVIARE CANAPES-i. 
Cut some slices of bread one-fourth inch thick, cut with 
the two-inch cutter into rounds. Fry in hot fat until both 
sides are brown. To one-fourth cup of butter made soft and 
creamy, add one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of 
paprika and one teaspoonful of watercress. Make into balls 
and let them become hard; when needed, spread on the 
bread slices and then put on a layer of caviare and squeeze 
a little lemon juice over all. To prepare the cress, wash 
and drain, then chop very fine, then squeeze it dry in a cloth. 

CAVIARE CANAPES-3. 

Cut some slices of bread a quarter of an inch thick, cut 
them out with a plain two-inch cutter and fry these rounds 
in a little butter till of a light golden color. When cold 
spread them over with Montpelier butter and place a layer 
of caviare on the top. vSqueeze lemon over them and serve. 

CRACKERS. 
Hot crackers always make a good relish. Butter them 
and then cover thickly with fine grated cheese. Place them 
in a baking pan and sprinkle a little sherry over them. Bake 
in a hot oven until slightly browned and serve at once. 

EGG SAVORY. 

Cook half a can of tomatoes eight minutes with a tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley and a teaspoonful of chopped 
onion ; add five eggs after beating them a little, and stir all 
together briskly until consistency of scrambled eggs. Add 
cayenne pepper and salt to taste. Thin slices of green pep- 
per are an addition. Serve on square pieces of hot toast, 
from which the crusts have been removed, and spread with 
anchovy paste ; then serve immediately. 

GASCONY BUTTER. 
Take equal quantities of parsley picked from the stalk 
and parboiled, of boned and pounded anchovies, and of fresh 
butter. Mix the ingredients well together and pass them 



l68 THE 3-6-5 .COOK BOOK.

put on the ice for one hour. These are nice little relishes 
for breakfast or lunch. 

HAM BUTTER. 

Pound together one hard-boiled yolk of egg, two table- 
spoonfuls of cooked ham, two tablespoonfuls of butter, a 
little cayenne. Mix until smooth. This butter is very nice 
spread on hot toast for breakfast or to use as a savory. 

OLIVE CUSTARDS. 

Take one ounce of grated cheese to one egg well beaten ; 
mix this over the fire until it becomes a very thick custard ; 
fry some neat little rounds of bread in butter, spread them 
very thinly with anchovy paste and pour on each a small 
quantity of the custard. Stone some olives, and put one in 
the middle of each round. 

PUFF PASTE STRAWS WITH BLOATER PASTE. 
One-fourth of a pound of flour, rub into it one table- 
spoonful of bloater paste, a little cayenne, one-half cup of 
cold water ; make into a smooth paste, roll it out and put on 
on it one-fourth of a pound of butter, fold it up and roll out 
six times, lastly roll out to one-eighth of an inch in thick- 
ness ; cut it into strips two inches long and one inch wide 
and bake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes ; take out 
and spread over them some bloater paste, and over that some 
whipped cream seasoned with a little salt and cayenne. 

SARDINE BUTTER. 

Remove the skins and bones from eight sardines ; put 
into a mortar and pound until smooth, two tablespoonfuls 
of parsley chopped very fine, four ounces of butter ; pound 
these with the sardines. This butter is very appetizing 
spread on hot toast. 

BROILED SARDINES ON TOAST. 
Broil the sardines ; have some small slices of hot toast ; 
place a sardine on each piece and pour over them a sauce 
made with the oil in which the sardines were packed, and 
one spoonful of paprika heated together. 



SAVORIES. 169 

SARDINES WITH CHEESE. 

Take small sardines, drain them from the oil, remove 
the skin and tip of the tail, and put over the fish a sprinkle 
of cheese grated fine. Make some slices of toast a little 
larger than the sardines, butter them and put the sardines 
on, place in the oven to warm, but not to become crisp, and 
serve hot. 

ICED SAVORY SOUFFLE. 

This dish can be made of almost any kind of fish, 
chicken or game ; it is excellent with lobster meat. Cut up 
the lobster or whatever it may be, into very small pieces; 
let it soak in mayonnaise sauce for two or three hours. 
Have some well-flavored aspic jelly and whip it till it is 
frothy. Put some of this at the bottom of the dish it is to 
be served in, then place a layer of the lobster and fill it up 
with aspic and lobster alternately till the mold is nearly 
full; place a stiff band of paper round, and fill it with 
whipped aspic. Put it on ice for two hours, take off the 
paper and serve. 

SAVORY. 

CHEESE, EGGS AND TOMATOES. 

One cup of tomatoes, two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
grated cheese, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, 
a little mustard, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, butter the size of an egg, and hot toast.

melt the butter ; when hot stir all the ingredients together 
and heat until very hot, but not boiling. Serve on slices 
of hot toast. 

SAVORY. 

CHEESE AND EGGS.

Pound to a paste four ounces of rich cheese with a 
small piece of butter (this varies with the dryness of the 
cheese), a couple of spoonfuls of vinegar from pickled 
walnuts, a good dash of cayenne, a dessertspoonful of 
essence of anchovy and the same of mustard. This mixtui-e, 
if heated over the fire, makes a delicious savory toast. 

A SAVORY OF SEMOLINA. 

Two tablespoonfuls of semolina ; stir into one pint of 
boiling milk, with a little salt, until it has the thickness of 
cream. Boil carefully (as milk is quick to burn) until it 
has the taste of being thoroughly cooked. In the mean- 
time beat the eggs, whites and yolks separately, about four 
to a pint of new milk. Stir in the yolks, keeping the sauce- 
pan a little longer on the fire ; follow with the whites and 
pour into a large shallow vessel. Place in a cool place for 
several hours until thoroughly set, when the semolina should 
be cut into pieces a couple of inches square, sprinkled over 
with grated cheese, and baked quickly in a hot oven.

A FEW BREAKFAST DISHES. I 77 



A FEW BREAKFAST DISHES. 



"A LITTLE BREAKFAST DISH." 

Cut two long slices of cold nieat and three of bread, 
buttered thickly, the same size and shape ; season the meat 
with pepper, salt and a little chopped parsley, or if veal is 
used, a little chopped ham, then lay one slice of the bread 
between two of the meat, and have the other two slices out- 
side ; fasten together with little wooden skewers. Put into 
a hot oven, baste with butter thoroughly, so that the bread 
is crisp and brown ; serve hot. 

BREAKFAST CUSTARD. 

One-half pint of sweet milk, two eggs if large ones, if 
not three eggs. Beat the eggs together until light, stir into 
the milk, add a little pinch of salt ; butter a pint bowl, pour 
in the mixture, and set the bowl in a tin of hot water, place 
in hot oven and bake for twenty minutes. Have a hot plate, 
turn the custard on this and pour over it a tomato sauce, or 
a sauce made of mushrooms, or a cream sauce. 

COLD MEAT BALLS. 
Chop the meat fine, season with salt and pepper ; make 
the meat into balls or flat cakes, fry them in a little butter 
or dripping. Fry some salt pork or bacon cut in thin slices 
and place around the balls. 

CROQ^UETTES. 

Stir into a cup of milk enough crustless bread to make 
a nice consistency (as glutinous as possible) ; add to this a 
cupful of cold meat of any kind, chopped fine. Season with 
a little chopped onion, chopped parsley, a piece of butter, 
salt and pepper. A few sliced mushrooms and some chopped 
truffles are, of course, an addition. This should be prepar- 
ed in the afternoon and allowed to remain in the ice chest 



178 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

until it is very cold. An hour before breakfast, remove from 
the ice and form the mixture into any desired shape, dip 
each croquette into the beaten yolk of an egg and then in 
bread crumbs, and place in the frying basket and put it back 
on the ice and do not again remove it until the fat is at the 
boiling point. By plunging the partly frozen forms into 
the intense heat, a coating, as it were, is formed, w^hereby 
the desired moisture inside is obtained as well as the possi- 
bility of maintaining the outward shapeliness. 

DRIED BEEF WITH EGGS. 
One-fourth pound of thinly sliced dried beef — shred it 
and let it lie in cold water for about fifteen minutes, then 
drain and cover the beef with milk, about one pint ; put on 
the stove, and when it begins to simmer, add one teaspoon- 
ful of flour, dissolved in one tablespoonful of cold milk ; one 
tablespoonful of butter, a little salt and pepper. As soon as 
the flour has cooked, break into the saucepan three eggs 
without beating, stir all rapidly until the eggs are cooked. 
Have several slices of hot toast ready, well buttered, and 
serve the beef, etc., on the toast— this will be enough for five 
half slices of toast. 

EGG TOAST. 

Six slices of bread, one egg, one cupful of milk, one 
salispoonful of salt. Beat the egg until light, add to the 
milk, also add the salt. Dip the slices of bread in the mix- 
ture, then have the griddle hot, grease it with a little butter 
and fry the toast on both sides. Serve hot. 

FRIZZLED BEEF. 
Shred the dried beef into little pieces, carefully remov" 
ing all fat, strings and sinews ; if the beef is very salt, fresh- 
en it by standing it in cold water for fifteen minutes, draiii- 
ing after. Put one tablespoonful of butter in the saucepan ; 
when hot, put in the beef and fry it for five minutes, then 
add one tablespoonful of flour dissolved in one cup of cream 
or milk ; as soon as the flour is cooked, serve. 

STEWED KIDNEY. 

Cut the kidney into small pieces about the size of a 
cherry, put into a colander and let cold water run over it 



A FEW BREAKFAST DISHES 



179 



while in the cohuider, then put on a pkite to drain ; put a 
piece of butter the size of a wahnit in a pot, and sprinkle 
flour on the bottom of the pot, and stir the flour and butter 
together with a spoon until brown, then sprinkle flour on 
the kidney in the colander, stirring them together well, 
then put the kidney into the hot pot on the stove, stirring 
it until it is well mixed, then pour hot water on it two inches 
deep; it must boil three hours to make it tender. Then 
take another piece of butter the same size, mix one table- 
spoonful of flour, pepper and salt with it to a paste, and 
stir it into the kidney, a little at a time and let it boil fifteen 
minutes ; while cooking it requires watching or it will burn. 

SAVORY MOLDS. 

Mince half a pound of underdone beef or mutton as 
finely as possible and put it into a basin with half its weight 
of bread crumbs, one ounce of butter broken into small 
pieces, a tablespoonful of finely minced onion, a teaspoonful 
of mixed powdered herbs and a good seasoning of salt and 
pepper. Mix these ingredients thoroughly, moisten with 
one beaten egg and fill in some small, well-buttered molds; 
bake in a moderate oven for half an hour, and turn out 
carefully ; insert a small sprig of parsley in the top of each, 
and pour a little brown gravy round the meat. 

"MY DEVIL." 

One tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, three 
mustardspoonfuls of mustard, one saltspoonful of salt, one- 
half saltspoonful of black pepper, one-fourth saltspoonful of 
cayenne pepper, one teaspoonful of vinegar, a few drops of 
" Soy," one small teaspoonful of brown sugar, a squeeze of 
lemon, one glass of port wine. Mix all well together— fry 
the meat (turkey legs generally) in a frying pan with a little 
butter; when almost ready, pour sauce over; boil up and 
serve. 

PORK TENDERLOINS. 

Broil the tenderloins and serve with melted butter poured 
over them, a little salt and pepper; serve very hot — very 
nice for breakfast. 



l80 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CALCUTTA TOAST. 
Put one tablespoonful of butter into the saucepan over 
boiling water ; as it melts, stir in two eggs, a little cayenne, 
one-half teaspoonf ul of essence of anchovy and a few chopped 
capers ; stir until the eggs are cooked ; then spread the 
mixture on hot buttered toast. Serve hot. 

TOMATO TOAST. 
Boil one-half can of tomatoes or six fresh ones for fifteen 
minutes, then add one saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper, 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, one-half tablespoonful of 
flour mixed together ; when the mixture is thick and smooth, 
pour over some pieces of hot, buttered toast. .Serve at once. 

VEAL SEFTON. 
Put one pint of strong, rich veal stock or gravy boiling 
hot, on to six fresh eggs, well beaten ; sprinkle in a little 
grated lemon peel, a dust of cayenne, salt and mace, then 
two ounces of melted butter. Bake slowly in buttered cups, 
turn out and serve with a good, rich gravy, or a tomato 
sauce. 

VIRGINIA WHITE PUDDINGS. 

One pint of fresh beef suet chopped fine and free from 
strings or skin, one pint of flour, one teacupful of corn meal, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper. Mix 
all well together, fill small cotton bags with this mixture, 
allowing a little space for the puddings to swell. Tie very 
tightly and boil for six hours, keeping the puddings well 
covered with water. When cold, hang in a cool, dry place ; 
when required for use, remove the bag and slice the pudding 
in thin slices and fry in a little butter. Serve very hot. 



iSi 



TRIPE. 



TO PREPARE TRIPE. 

When the tripe comes from the butchers, scrape it well, 
then put it on to boil in cold water ; as soon as it boils drain 
off the water and replace with more cold water — boil for 
four hours ; add to the water one onion, one teaspoonful of 
salt, a little cayenne, six pepper-corns and two cloves tied 
in a little bag, one bay leaf, one tablespoonful of vinegar ; 
when the tripe is cooked it is ready to be used for any of 
the various preparations of tripe. 

CREAMED TRIPE. 

Prepare the trip as directed. Cut the tripe into small 
pieces; put one tablespoonful of butter into the stew-pan ; 
when it is hot add one tablespoonful of flour, stir together ; 
when smooth add one teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, 
a little nutmeg, one-half pint of cream and the tripe, and 
cook for five minutes. 

TRIPE CUTLETS. 

Prepare the tripe as directed. Cut the tripe into pieces 
large enough for one portion ; dip each cutlet into beaten 
egg, then into fine bread crumbs— have the crumbs seasoned 
with salt and pepper, a little cayenne and a very )ittle nyt- 
meg, then into the egg again. Take one tablespoonful of 
butter, place in a pan ; when hot, put in the cutlets, brown 
and turn— they are cooked as soon as they are brown. .Serve 
hot. 

FRIED TRIPE. 

Prepare the tripe as directed. Cut the tripe into small 
pieces, dip them in beaten egg, then into bread crumbs ; fry 
in deep hot fat. 



l82 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

TRIPE A LA MODE. 

Cook the tripe for four hours and let it cool ; take one 
slice of bacon, one onion, one garlic clove, one teaspoonful 
of butter, one-half teaspoonful of sugar ; fry together until 
brown, add one teacup of stock, boil once, then strain and 
add one teacup of tomatoes, one-half teaspoonful of salt. 
Take two teaspoonfuls of butter in the saucepan, when hot 
add one tablespoonful of flour, when smooth add the sauce, 
stirring all the time, then add the tripe which should be cut 
in small pieces two inches square ; cook long enough to 
thoroughly season the tripe ; just before serving add one 
yolk of an egg, beaten with one tablespoonful of cream. 

TRIPE AND OYvSTERS. 

One pound of tripe, one quart of oysters. Cut the 
tripe into inch pieces ; drain the oysters, cook the tripe in 
boiling water for five minutes ; put the oysters in a pan and 
let them just come to the boiling point, then drain them. 
Make a white sauce of two tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; when hot, add one cup of cream; 
when smooth, add the tripe and oysters, seasoned with salt 
and pepper. 

TRIPE. 

It may not be generally known that stewed tripe is the 
most easily digested of all solid animal food ; it is fully 
digested in one hour after being eaten. 



FRYING. 183 



FRYING. 

In frying be sure that the pan is perfectly clean. To 
fry well the fat must always be very hot. To test this throw 
into the pan a bit of bread ; if it turns a light brown at 
once the fat is in a proper condition. 

Do not be afraid to put one or two pounds of fat into 
your frying pan ; it can be used over and over again, pro- 
vided it is strained each time. 

To Clarify Dripping — When poured from the meat pan 
it should be put into a bowl, pour into it some boiling water 
and a little salt, and stir well ; when it is cold remove from 
the bowl — the water and sediment will be at the bottom. 
Scrape the cake of dripping, put it into some more boiling 
water until it melts, then stir well and let it cool ; place in 
a crock and it will keep for weeks in cool weather. 

All the fats skimmed from boiled meats, soups, etc., 
should be treated in the same way and then added to the 
general crock. 

Fat for Frying — The light colored drippings of roast 
meat and the fat taken off from broths or beef suet chopped 
fine and melted down without browning. As soon as the 
bottom of the stew-pan can be seen through the suet is done. 

Olive oil of the best quality is tasteless, and is the best 
of all frying media. 

FRYING MIXTURE. 

A mixture of one-half lard and one-half beef suet is a 
good frying medium, 

BEEF SUET DRIPPING. 
Prepare the dripping by putting into a basin and pour- 
ing boiling water over it, stirring well to wash the suet from 
all impurities, then let it cool — all the impurities will settle 
with the water at the bottom of the basin ; when cold, place 



184 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

on lire ; when hot, remove the dripping and put it away in 
a cool place. Beef dripping is preferable to other dripping 
for cooking. 

Frying once understood is a very easy process ; to have 
the operation successful the fat must be deep and very hot ; 
when the smoke comes from the center of the fat, a bit of 
bread thrown into it at this stage must color at once. The 
time for frying any article must be very short, two minutes 
being, in nearly every case quite enough. A kettle which 
has suspended from the handle a basket which can be filled 
with the articles to be fried and then let down into the fat 
is the best possible arrangement for frying. 

FRYING BATTER. 

Mix together in a bowl four tablespoonfuls of flour, one 
of olive oil, a saltspoonful of salt, the yolks of two eggs and 
enough cold water to make a stiff batter, about half a pint ; 
the batter should be stiff enough to hold on its surface the 
drops from the mixing spoon. Just before using the batter 
add to it the whites of the two eggs beaten to a stiff froth. 
This batter may be used with any kind of fruit, or with 
chopped oysters or clams, to make oyster and clam fritters. 

FRYING MEDIUM. 

Equal quantities of butter and beef suet make an ex- 
cellent frying medium. Boil the beef suet in plenty of hot 
water, strain, melt the butter, pour the suet and butter 
together and let them cool. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

TO RENDER LARD. 

Cut the fresh lard into small pieces, let it melt slowly 
over a moderate fire, as it melts pour it off and strain it into 
small crocks, — cover with oiled paper when cold.

sprinkle over the grated yolks. Garnish with bacon cut in 
ribbons, and crisped in hot spider. 

FISH DINNER.

hard-boiled egg, one tablespoonful of cooked codfish, either 
fresh or salt, small piece of cooked carrot, one cucumber 
pickle, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, according to taste,

Put the stock into the stewpan or dialing dish ; beat the 
flour and butter well together and stir into the boiling stock ; 
stir constantly until thick and smooth ; add the meat, salt 
and pepper and cook for five minutes, then remove from 
the fire or put out the lamp of the chafing dish and add the 
sherry. Cold chicken, turkey, game and veal are all very 
good treated in this manner. 

COLD ROAST BEEF. 

Six slices of rare roast beef, six tablespoonfuls of toma- 
toes, one-half teacup of gravy, one onion chopped fine, one

Put the butter into the blazer with the onion, stew for 
about five minutes, then add the tomatoes and the gravy, 
sauce, mustard, salt and pepper ; when the mixture is 
smooth add the beef. As soon as the beef is hot it is ready 
to serve. Any rare cooked meat can be treated in the same 
way. 

LIVER. 

Slice a calf's liver one-fourth of an inch in thickness, 
dip each slice in flour, in which mix some salt and pepper

cook these for five minutes, then turn them, cook three 
minutes longer, then add one wine glass of sherry or port 
wine ; let this boil once, then serve.

One pint of tomatoes ; as soon as the tomatoes com- 
mence to boil, add one tablespoonful of butter, some salt 
and pepper, then add three well beaten eggs, one small 
pinch of soda ; as soon as the mixture has thickened pour 
out and serve on thin slices of toast. 

VENISON STEAK. 
Take two pounds of venison steak, cut into portions, 
about enough for each person to be served. Put into the 
chafing dish two tablespoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, and one tablespoon- 
ful of currant jelly (the lemon juice may be omitted). Stir 
this mixture until it is hot, then add the venison and cook 
for five or six minutes, — if wanted very rare, four minutes 
will answer ; add at the last two tablespoonfuls of port or 
sherry wine if desired. Slices of venison are very nice 
warmed in the chafing dish with the gravy left from the 
roast of a previous meal. 

WELSH RAREBIT. 
Melt one tablespoonful of butter in the chafing dish ; 
when hot add three teacupfuls of cheese (American) cut in 
small pieces, a little cayenne, and about one-third of a pint 
of beer, or the same amount of cream ; stir constantly ; when 
melted, pour the mixture on toast. Poached eggs can be 
added after the cheese is melted and poured on the toast, 
and the mixture is then called a golden buck, one egg to 
each slice of toast.

of melted butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, one-half cake 
of compressed yeast. Heat the milk, but do not let it boil, 
pour it on the beaten egg, add melted butter, sugar, a little 
salt and flour enough to make a stiff sponge. Set in a warm 
place to rise ; when light knead in flour enough to make a 
stiff dough ; let rise again, then divide the dough into two 
parts and roll out separately ; spread over one-half of it 
some melted butter so that every atom of the surface is 
thoroughly greased, then lay the other half over the buttered 
one, and roll till an inch thick. Cut in small biscuits with 
a tin cutter (one-fourth pound baking powder box can be 
used), let rise ; when light, bake. Should be very light and 
puffy. Mix at nine in the morning if you want them for 
supper. Do not bake till after you begin to eat supper, so 
that they may be hot.

as soft as it possibly can be handled • bake in a quick oven. 



BREADS, BTSCUITS, ETC. igC 

BUTTERED CAKES. 
One pound of flour, sift this into a basin, make a hollow 
in the center and mix in it one cake of compressed yeast 
dissolved in one-half teacup of warm milk, then put the 
sponge to rise in a warm place ; when the sponge has risen 
to twice its original size, add one-half tablespoonful of 
sugar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, four tablespoonfuls of 
butter, and one-half teacup of milk ; mix these well into 
the sponge, and then add six eggs, mixing each egg sepa- 
rately ; work these to a smooth paste and put it in a bowl, 
lightly covered, to rise for three hours in a warm place; 
then sprinkle the pasteboard with flour, place the dough on 
it, divide into small portions, make into small cakes, place 
on the baking tins one and one-half inch space between 
each ; brush them over with egg and let them rise for one 
hour, then bake in hot oven ; when baked, split them open 
without separating entirely ; place a little butter in each, 
and serve hot. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES-i. 
One quart of buckwheat flour, one tablespoonful of 
wheat flour, mix these into a batter with one pint of luke- 
warm water ; dissolve one cake of compressed yeast in a 
little warm water and add to the batter (or one teacupful 
of home-made yeast can be used) ; add one teaspoonful of 
salt. Beat the batter well and put in a warm place to rise. 
Start the batter the noon before the cakes are needed, as it 
requires to rise several times and be stirred down each time 
to make really good cakes. Next morning if the batter is 
oo thick, thin it with a little warm water; add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream if convenient and two tablespoonfuls of 
molasses and one-half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a 
little warm water. Keep one cupful of the batter to start 
the next cakes with. In winter, batter can be kept for 
several weeks. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES-2. 
Two quarts of hot water, enough buckwheat flour to 
make with the water a stiff batter. Add one-half a cup of 
wheat flour to the buckwheat ; one saltspoonful of salt, dis- 
solve one cake of compressed yeast in a little water, add to 



IC)6 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

the batter ; or one scant teacupful of home made yeast. Mix 
batter on the afternoon before the cakes are required for 
breakfast. Next morning add a spoonful of common mo- 
lasses, also a spoonful of melted butter and one-half tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in warm water. If the batter is 
too thick, thin it with either warm milk or water. 

BRIOCHE. 
Take of your bread sponge wImcIi is made of potatoes 
and no milk, as much sponge as when flour is added, will 
make a lump the size of a large orange ; let this rise. 

Put eight eggs into a basin with one pound of butter, 
jne teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar ; beat all 
;hese together until smooth, then add to the lump of dough 
as it has risen ; work these together for a long time, put to 
rise again, work it well, put to rise the second time and work 
it ; then the third time ; make into cakes like little pin-cush- 
ions and bake in a hot oven. If the cakes are for tea, do 
not add the eggs until noon ; keep the dough cool, add very 
little flour, as the secret is to keep the cakes very soft. The 
whole process takes seven hours. 

BUNS. 
One-half pound of flour in which work one-half pound 
of butter, then add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little salt, 
a little nutmeg. Boil one teacup of milk, in which dissolve 
one-third teaspoonful of soda, pour over the flour mixture, 
and then add two eggs well beaten, leaving out one white; 
when the white is well mixed, grease a baking tin and drop 
on the buns with a spoon and bake in a moderate oven. 

ENGLISH BUNS. 
Mix one and one-half pints of sweet milk and one yeast 
cake, dissolve in half a cup of tepid water, with flour enough 
to make a thick batter. Set this mixture in a warm place 
and let it rise over night. In the morning add one cup of 
sugar, half a cup of melted butter, one saltspoonful of salt, 
half a nutmeg grated, and just enough flour to make a bat- 
ter that can be handled ; knead well and let the dough rise 
four or five hours. Roll it out to three-quarters of an 
inch thick, and cut into round cakes. Lay them in rows on 
a buttered biscuit pan, and when the buns have stood in the 



BREADS, ]?1SCUITS, ETC. 197 

pans half an hour, make a cross with a knife upon the top 
of eacli one. Place the pans in a moderate oven and bake 
the buns a light brown. Beat the white of an egg stiff and 
add to the egg a little powdered sugar, and lightly cover the 
tops of the buns when they are taken from the oven. 

ENGLISH HOT CROSS BUNS. 
Sift into a large bowl one quart of fiour, half a cup of 
sugar and one-half a teaspoonful of salt ; dissolve one-fourth 
of a cup of butter in a generous half pint of warm milk, and 
add to the dry ingredients, with the yolks of two beaten 
eggs ; add half a yeast cake dissolved in a little water, half 
a nutmeg grated and the whites of the two eggs beaten 
stiff; this should make a very soft dough; cover the bowl 
with a clean cloth, place it where it will keep warm, and 
let it rise over night. In the morning take pieces of the 
dough the size of an egg, and with a little flour, mold them 
into round cakes an inch in thickness. Place them on a but- 
tered tin, leaving a little space between. Cover the tins and 
set in a warm place for the buns to rise ; they should be 
double their original size. With a sharp knife cut a cross 
in the center of each bun. Bake them in a moderate oven 
about a half hour. When the buns are baked brush the 
tops with a syrup made of sugar and water. 

BUNS FOR GOOD FRIDAY. 
Two quarts of flour, one quart of warm milk, one-fourth 
pound of butter, one-half cup of yeast. Mix and let raise 
four hours, then add four eggs, one-half pound of sugar, one 
teacup of currants, let all rise in the dough for two hours; 
when very light, cut them into small buns; brush the tops 
with a little mixed milk and molasses. Let the buns rise 
after they are made into small one. Bake twenty minutes. 

KARLSBADEN KIPFEL (Buns). 
One and one-eighth pounds of flour, one gill of sweet 
milk, one-half a yeast cake, dissolved in a little warm water ; 
make these into a sponge and let it rise ; when it has risen,

the popover kind. They are made with a much larger 
quantity of eggs than the ordinary wheat popovers. Beat 
the yolks of five eggs thoroughly with the patent egg-beater 
and stir them into a pint of sweet cream. Do not use a 
heavy cream for this purpose, but a light quality. Pour the 
mixture on a pint and a quarter of pastry flour sifted with 
half a teaspoonful of salt ; beat the batter well with a patent 
egg-beater and fold in carefully the whites of five eggs

spoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, about three 
cups of flour. Scald the milk, add butter and salt. When 
luke warm, add yeast dissolved in one-fourth cup of 
luke warm water. Stir in enough flour to make a thick 
batter, cover well ; put in a warm place ; let rise two and 
one-half hours, then stir and put a big spoonful in greased 
muftin rings about half full. Turn when brown. Then 
split and toast and butter well — you can do this the next 
day, for the ones left. 

RYE MEAL MUFFINS. 

Two cups of rye meal, one-half cup of molasses, one 
teaspoonful of salaratus dissolved in one cup of sour milk, 
one egg well beaten ; bake in muffin rings. 

QUICK WHEAT FLOUR MUFFINS.

milk, four whites of eggs, one teaspoonful of baking powder, 
two cups of flour, a little salt. Bake in muflin rings on the 
griddle, which has been rubbed with a little butter, the 
griddle must be hot ; turn the muffins with cake turner. 

CORN MEAL MUSH. 

One quart of boiling water ; stir into this one and one- 
fourth pints of corn meal mixed smooth with one pint of 
cold water, two tablespoonfuls of salt ; stir until the mush is 
well cooked. If required for fried mush, fill little cans 
(those that come with baking powder in them are very nice), 
as the mush can then be cut in round slices for frying ; 
when cold, slice ; dip each slice in bread crumbs and beaten 
egg and fry in deep, hot fat. 

ADIRONDACK PANCAKES. 

One quart of sour milk, add flour enough to make a thick 
batter. Let this stand twenty-four hours ; add then two

PAN-CAKES. 

One quart of sour milk, one-half teaspoonful of soda, 
one teaspoonful of salt, four eggs ; stir together, thicken 
with flour until a good batter is made, then stir in the yolks 
of the eggs well beaten, and then the whites beaten stiff, 
add the whites very carefully. For waffles, same batter, 
only add two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 

POPOVERS— I. 

Pastry flour is the most desirable, but the best bread 
flour will do. Sift two cups of flour with lialf a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Add gradually two cups of milk, and when a 
smooth batter has been obtained mix in two eggs without 
separating the whites and yolks. Add a teaspoonful of 
butter, melted. Beat the fatter thoroughly ; pour it at once 
into the cups of stoneware, well buttered. Do not fill the 
cups more than half full. Bake the cakes in a quick oven 
until, true to their name, they rise far above the edges of 
the cups and hang over them in a rich, brown crust. These 
cakes are nice for breakfast when served with either maple 
syrup or cream sauce ; or may be eaten like a muffin, with 
butter. They are often served as a plain dessert with 
sweetened cream. 

POPOVERS— 3. 

One pint of milk, one pint of flour, two eggs. Beat 

eggs separately and add milk and flour ; mix thoroughly and 

add one saltspoonful of salt. Bake in small pans, and fill 

half full ; the pans must be hot when the mixture is put in. 

GRAHAM POPOVERS. 
Half a pint of sifted Graham flour, half a pint of sifted 
wheat flour, one tablespoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, and a teaspoonful of butter, melted. Beat the whites 
and yolks together and beat the batter vigorously with a 
patent egg-beater. Pour the batter into buttered cups of 
stoneware. They should rise, like all popovers, to four times 
their original size. If they are baked in an ordinary muffin 
pan or even in a heated iron gem pan, they will not rise in 
this way. Wheat popovers are light and about double in 
bulk baked in gem pans ; in stone cups they are four times 
the bulk. 



BREADS, BISCUITS, ETC. 203 

RYE POPOVERS. 

Rye meal from which Boston brown bread is made, is 
used, not rye Hour. Mix an even cup and a half of rye meal 
with an even cup of wheat flour ; add a tablespoonful of 
sugar and half a teaspoonful of salt. Pour over these dry 
ingredients a pint of milk, mixing it to a smooth batter. 
Add three eggs, whites and yolks together. Beat the batter 
thoroughly and pour into a dozen stoneware cups well 
buttered. Bake the cakes in an oven that is very hot for 
the first twenty minutes ; then reduce the heat and bake 
them from twenty to thirty minutes longer. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 

Two quarts of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half 
cake of yeast, one-fourth teacup of sugar, one-half teacup 
of lard, one pint of milk. Boil the milk, melt it in the lard,

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CAKE MAKING. 

All materials for cake must be of the very best. Before 
commencing, see that the oven is right for properly baking 
the cake — one very good test for the right heat, is to place 
in the mouth of the oven a little flour ; if it browns in five 
minutes, the heat is right. Another is to hold the bare 
hand without being inconvenienced in the oven for one 
second ; if the oven is too hot the cake will rise and then 
fall ; if a piece of white paper colors a light brown in five 
minutes after it is put in the oven, the oven is right for all 
rich cakes. Cake made without butter, or with very little 
butter, requires a hotter oven than a rich cake ; thin cakes 
require a hot oven. Never jar the oven while the cake is 
baking. Before commencing to mix the batter, have all 
the materials ready ; the pans greased, the flour sifted 
twice, the granulated sugar sifted, the eggs counted and 
separated. First cream the butter, and add to it the sugar 
gradually. When these are light add the yolks well 
beaten. Where there is not enough butter to make the 
mixture creamy, add a part of the yolks, and after, the 
balance. Then add the milk, then the flour, measured after 
sifting, and in it sift the baking powder, then add the 
flavoring and one saltspoonful of salt ; lastly the whites 
beaten until stiff. These should be folded into the batter. 
In mixing cake an upward beating motion is better than 
stirring, as more air is introduced into the mixture. If the 
cake is not to be iced, a thin sprinkle of powdered sugar 
over the batter, just before baking, and when in tins will 
give a smooth surface. Sponge cake should have coarse 
granulated sugar sprinkled over the batter. To know if 
the cake is done stick a broom straw into the cake, if it 
comes out clean, the cake is done. All fruit should be 
lightly floured, and stirred into the batter at the last.

MEAvSUREMENTS. 

Exactness in measuring is absolutely necessary. 

When a receipt calls for a ''cupful of anything," it 
means one-half a pint, tin measures holding just this 
amount can be purchased at any house furnishing store. ' 

Loaf cakes require about an hour to bake. Layer 
cakes and small cakes about twenty-five minutes. 

ALMOND CAKE. 

ONE HOUR TO BAKE. 

One pound of flour, one pound of sugar, one pound of 
seeded raisins chopped, three-fourth pound of butter, one 
cup of thin sour cream, four eggs, one nutmeg, rind and 
juice of one lemon, one teaspoonful of cloves, one teaspoon- 
ful of soda, one wine glass of wine or brandy, one cup of 
almonds blanched and chopped fine. Beat butter and sugar 
together, add the milk eggs beaten separately, spices, 
lemon, cream, soda, dissolved in a little warm water; the 
wine, flour and almonds. Bake in three tins ; when baked, 
ice with the following mixture : Two eggs, whites only, 
the juice of one lemon, one cocoanut grated, one pound of 
raisins, one cup of blanched and chopped almonds; beat 
the eggs with one-half teacup of sugar, add the lemon juice 
then add a little more sugar — just enough to enable you to 
spread the mixture on the cakes ; then put on this frosting 
the grated cocoanut, then a layer of the raisins, put the 
raisins into boiling water a minute before using them ; 
then a layer of the almonds, then a layer of the frosting. 

ANGEL CAKE. 

ONE HOUR TO BAKE. 

Beat the whites of eleven eggs to a stiff froth ; sift into 
them a little at a time, ten ounces, or one and one-half 
tumblers of powdered sugar, mixing carefully and lightly 
then sift five ounces, or one tumbler of flour four times, add 
a level teaspoonful of cream of tartar to the flour, sift it 
again, and then sift into the eggs and sugar a little at a 
time, mixing it carefully and lightly ; when all the flour is 
used, add a teaspoonful of vanilla essence to the cake and 
put it into a new tin cake pan or mold, not buttered or 
lined. Bake it in a moderate oven about three-quarters of 



CAKES. 209 

an hour, testing it with a broom straw ; when the straw 
comes out clean, the cake is done. Let the cake cool 
gradually in the mouth of the oven with the door open. 
When the cake is quite cold loosen it from the sides of the 
pan with a knife and turn it out. The success of this de- 
licious depends upon preserving its lightness. If the 
eggs are beaten quite stiff, and the flour and sugar very 
carefully sifted and stirred in, it will be light. Do not 
open the oven for fifteen minutes after the cake has been 
put into it. 

BLACK CAKE. 

Bake Black Cake in a porcelain baking dish, if possible. 
The cake baked in a tin often becomes very dry and hard 
outside, from the long time necessary to properly bake it. 

Put into the crock with black cake, a thick slice of 
bread ; when very stale, another slice ; this will keep the 
black cake fresh and moist.

mon, molasses, one nutmeg. Bake three hours. 

Mix the butter and sugar together until light, then add 
the yolks of the eggs beaten light, then the flour, then the 
whites beaten very stiff, then the fruit (retain a little of the 
flour to sprinkle over the fruit), then the spice and 
liquor.

ROYAL ICING. 
Use the best confectioner's sugar, sift it until perfectl}^ 
fine. Take the whites of two eggs, beat them slightly, 
then add the sugar gradually, adding a little lemon juice 
from time to time. A very little corn-starch improves this 
icing. When the icing is perfectly smooth and will spread 
on the cake without running, it is ready for use, and should 
be used at once. Place a lump on the center of the cake 
and spread it over the cake with a palette knife ; dip the 
knife every now and then into cold water, then ice the sides 
of the cake, commencing at the bottom.

stirring it all the time ; then place the sauce pan on the hot 
fire and boil very fast ; do not stir it, however ; have a cup 
of cold ^yater aften ten minutes' fast boiling, drop into it a 
little of the syrup, if it will roll into a solt ball between 
your thumb and finger it is done, take from the fire and let 
the syrup cool. When cool, beat it hard with a wooden

of cold water and proceed as before. Keep the fondant in 
a jar until required. When needed, place the jar in a sauce 
pan half filled with boiling water and stir the fondant until 
it is soft, then spread or pour it over the cake or cakes. 
The fondant can be made any desired color by the colorings 
sold for the purpose, and flavored as desired. 



ICE CREAIVl, ICES, MOUSSE. 327 



ICE CREAM, ICES, MOUSSE. 



Always have the mixture to be frozen, cold before 
putting into the freezer ; the ice crushed fine and one-third 
as much salt as ice; when the freezer is well packed in salt 
and ice, pour in a pint of water — this fills in the spaces left 
by the ice and salt, and helps the melting of the ice. Salt 
water at the freezing point is colder than fresh water at the 
same point. A mistake is often made in turning the dasher 
too rapidly; the cream will not freeze until the ice around 
begins to melt ; use plenty of rock salt, turn the crank 
slowly, and the cream will be frozen in about twenty 
minutes.

PASTRY, PIES, AND PUDDINGS. 



Pastry can be made with any good fiour, thougli 
"pastry flour" is more apt to be successful. 

A VERY GOOD PASTRY. 

One and one-half cup of flour, one-fourth cup of lard, 
one-fourth cup of butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, ice 
water. Wash the butter, dry in a clean napkin, pat into a 
circular piece, add the salt to the flour, then rub into the 
flour the lard. It is better to cut the lard into the flour 
with a knife, moisten the flour to a thick dough with the 
ice-water, place the paste on the board, which sprinkle very 
lightly with flour, roll out the paste, then place on the 
butter and roll it out, fold the paste over, so as to make 
three layers ; turn for three half rounds, pat again, roll out ; 
repeat this three times. To place the butter, put it on the 
lower half of the paste, fold over, press the edges together 
with finger, so as to keep in the air ; turn one side over the 
butter, then the other under. Always roll out from you. 

PUFF PASTE— I. 

Puff paste should be made in a cool place always. 
Take equal quantities of pastry flour and butter. Wash 
the butter well in ice water, work it into smooth ball. 
Mix into the flour one teaspoonful of salt to a pound of 
flour. Make a paste with ice water, work until perfectly 
smooth and stiff, let it rest five minutes. Roll the paste 
out, put the butter on it, fold the paste about the butter 
and roll it out to one-half an inch in thickness, then fold 
over twice, it will then be in four thicknesses ; repeat this 
five times; let the paste rest each time, five ininutes be- 
tween. 



PASTRY, PIES, AND PlTDDIXCiS. 233 

PUFF PASTE— 2. 

One pound of flour, one pound of butter, scant one- 
half pint of ice water, one saltspoonful of salt. Mix the 
flour into dough with the ice water and salt ; reserve a little 
flour for the rolling out of the butter. Knead the dough 
well, and then make it into a ball, which pound with the 
rolling-pin until it is full of blisters, then put the dough on 
the ice for fifteen minutes. Wash the butter in cold water, 
wring it out in a clean napkin until dry, then put it on the 
ice for fifteen minutes. Take the dough, roll it out to one- 
half an inch in thickness; take one-fourth of the butter, 
spread it on one-half of the dough, sprinkle just a little 
flour on it to prevent the rolling-pin from sticking to it, 
fold over the other half and roll it; fold four times, using 
all the butter — let the paste rest fifteen minutes between 
each rolling, then put the paste on the ice to become very 
cold. In winter this is accomplished quickly and well by 
putting the paste out of doors covered; when the paste is 
required, handle it as little as possible, roll it to the re- 
quired thickness at once ; the paste will be lighter and more 
delicate if this is observed ; bear as lightly as possible on the 
rolling-pin. 

BEEF DRIPPING PASTRY. 

Take one pound of flour and one-half pound of beef 
dripping, prepared as directed ; one-half pint of cold water. 
Mix the flour and water into a smooth paste, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt ; roll it out three times, each time place on 
the paste one-third of the dripping in small pieces, roll the 
dripping lightly into the paste — if desired for a fruit pie 
crust, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

BEEF SUET PAS^^RY. 

One-half pound of beef suet, one pound of flour, one- 
half pint of cold water ; take all the skin and shreds from 
the suet, chop it very fine, and rub it well into the flour 
with one teaspoonful of salt, work it all to a smooth paste 
with the water; roll it out to the thickness desired and it 
is readv to use. 



234 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

FLEAD PASTRY. 
One pound of flour, three-fourths pound of fresh flead, 
one-half pint of water, one saltspoonful of salt. Take off 
the skin from the flead, cut the flead into thin flakes, rub it 
into the flour, add the salt and water, work all into a 
smooth paste, fold it three times, then beat it well with the 
rolling-pin, roll it out and it is ready for use. This crust 
is very light and makes and excellent crust for apple pies, 
or small tarts. 

A FINE PIE CRUST. 
One pound of flour, one-half pound of butter ; rub the 
flour and butter together while dry— add enough ice water 
to make a dough ; do not knead the dough, but roll it out 
with the rolling-pin four times. Let it stand two hours at 
least before baking. This will be crust enough for four 
pies with top crusts. 

PIE CRUST FOR ONE PIE. 
One coffeecup of sifted flour, one-half cofteecup of lard 
or drippings, rubbed together with one-half teaspoonful of 
salt ; cold water to moisten ; do not make the paste wet ; 
roll out quickly. 

APPLE CHEESE PIES. 
Mix together one-half pound of stewed apples, one-half 
pound of sugar, a little salt, juice of one lemon, four eggs. 
Line a pie plate with pastry and fill with the mixture, bake 
until brown. 

APPLE MERINGUE. 
Stew some apples until soft, add one cup of sugar, a 
little salt and a little nutmeg, strain through a colander; 
when cold, fill the pie tins, which must be lined with pastry, 
and bake; as soon as the pie crust is baked, remove from 
oven. Whip the whites of three eggs until stiff", add three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and put over the pie ; bake for a 
few moments, or until the meringue is firm. 

APPLE PIE- 1. 
Slice the apples in thin slices, cover the pie tin or plate 
with a crust, which rub over with the unbeaten white of an 



PASTRY, PTKS, AND PUDDINGS. 235 

egg. Put the apples on tlie crust, with one-half a cup of 
sugar, one-half saltspoonful of salt, a few bits of butter, 
one teaspoonful of flour and one teaspoonful of ground 
cinnamon ; then put on the upper crust, bake about forty 
minutes.

dissolved. Pour into glasses and cover these when cold, 
with papers dipped in alcohol. 



264 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Make the jelly when the fruit is just turning red— the 
jelly will be firmer and of a better color than it will be 
made from very ripe currants. Strip the currants from 
their stems, wash them and put into the preserving kettle, 
stir until the juice starts from them freely, then strain the 
juice through the jelly bag, weigh the juice and to every 
pound allow one pound of sugar, boil the juice for twenty 
minutes, skim carefully, then add the sugar, which should 
be hot ; stir until the sugar is dissolved, skim and pour into 
jelly glasses, cover these next day with paper wet in 
alcohol, and an outside paper tied or pasted over. If the 
currants are not too ripe the jelly will be firm without longer 
boiling. Test the juice on a saucer ; if it jellies quickly it is 
cooked enough.

next morning, continue to do this for eight mornings, the 
ninth morning put in the other half of the sugar and scald 
it ; when boiling put in the cherries and let them scald, then 
seal In glass jars. 



PKESERVKS, ETC. 265 

CRAB APPLE JELLY. 
Put the crab-apples into the kettle with not quite 
enough water to cover them, let them simmer until soft ; 
strain through a sieve. Take the pulp and strain it through 
a cheese cloth bag, then strain all the juice through a flannel 
bag. To the juice allow three pints of sugar to four pints 
of juice ; boil the juice twenty minutes before adding the 
sugar ; boil together until the juice will thicken on a spoon 
when tested. Fill the jelly glasses, dip them in warm 
water before tilling. When the jelly is cold put a thin 
paper on the top of each glass, dipped in alcohol, and paste 
over the top of the glass a paper which can be pasted tightly 
over by using the beaten white of egg for the paste. 

BRANDIED CHERRIES. 
Pick the cherries on a dry, clear day ; fill wide mouthed, 
glass jars with the fruit, and then pour in as much good, 
pale brandy as the jars will hold. Cover closely and place 
in a cool, dry place for four weeks. Then pour off the 
liquor; add to each pint three-quarters of a pound of white 
sugar ; boil these together until a thick syrup is obtained, 
strain it and pour it over the cherries, then boil all together 
for five minutes ; return to the bottles and cover tightly. 

GRAPE JUICE. 
Take only fresh ripe grapes, the Concord grapes make 
the richest juice, though other grapes may be used. Free 
the grapes from the stems, use no sugar ; put on the fire ; 
as soon as the grapes are soft strain them through a jelly 
bag of flannel or cheese cloth ; when strained, put back on 
the fire, and when boiling once more, bottle and seal or put 
into glass jars and seal, 

FRUIT JAM. 
Mix strawberries and pineapple. To every bowlful of 
strawberries put one-half a bowlful of pineapple shredded 
fine, — to each pound of mixed fruit put three-fourth pounds 
of sugar. Boil for two hours and seal while hot. 

PEAR PRESERVES. 
Four pounds of hard pears, four pounds of sugar, one- 
fourth pound of preserved ginger, four lemons, one pint of 



366 THK 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

water. Pare and cut the pears into very thin slices, chop 
the ginger fine. Place pears, ginger, sugar, lemon peel 
and water into the preserving kettle and boil until the fruit 
is transparent, adding the lemon juice at the end. Seal 
while hot. 

DAMSON PLUM JAM. 

Stone the plums, which should be freslj and ripe, boil 
them for forty minutes in the preserving kettle, skim care- 
fully, then add three-fourths of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of plums, boil for fifteen minutes, then put into 
small glasses or jam pots ; cover when cold with papers 
dipped in alcohol, and outside of these paste a stiff paper. 

Green gage plums are prepared in the same way. 

BRANDY PLUMS. 

Ten quarts of plums, seven pounds of sugar, to every 
pound a half pint of water ; when melted, put in the plums, 
having stuck them all with d pin. Throw them into cold 
water, then back into the syrup and let them stand until 
tender (do not boil). Strain the syrup, then let cool, when 
cold put your plums into jars, and to every half pint of 
syrup put one-half pint of brandy ; bottle. 

PEACH MARMALADE. 

Pare, cut in pieces and weigh the peaches ; for every 
pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Cook the peaches 
in a very little water for three-fourths of an hour, skim 
carefully and then add the sugar ; crack a number of the 
stones and put the kernels into the marmalade, add one 
tablespoonful of lemon juice ; boil all together for ten 
minutes, then put into small glasses; cover the next day 
with papers dipped in alcohol, and paste an outside paper 
over. It is an improvement, after the peaches are tender 
and before the sugar is added, if the fruit is pressed through 
a sieve and then returned to the fire. 

PLUM MARMALADE. 

Prepare in the same manner as peach marmalade, only 
omitting the lemon juice. 



I'UKSERVES, ETC. 267 

PINEAPPLE MARMALADE. 

Peel the pineapples, carefully removing all the dark 
specks, then grate the fruit on a coarse grater, and put it 
into the preserving kettle, allowing to each pound of fruit 
a scant pound of sugar. Boil sugar and fruit together until 
the fruit is clear, skim and then put into small glasses or 
jam pots. Cover when cold with papers dipped in alcohol, 
and over this paste stiff white paper. 

QUINCE AND APPLE MARMALADE. 

Peel, cut in pieces, equal quantities of apples and 
quinces, and follow the directions for peach marmalade, 
omitting the lemon juice ; add one-half teaspoonful of salt. 
Be careful to remove the hard parts of the quince around 
the cores, and cook the quinces first in water until tender 
before adding the apples. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Peel the peaches, remove the stones, then weigh the 
fruit ; to every pound of peaches put one-fourth pound of 
sugar, place all in the preserving kettle with a little water ; 
let the fruit boil for ten minutes, skim carefully. Place in 
jars, and fill the jars very full. Screw on the covers as soon 
as the fruit is put in the jars. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Peel the peaches, cut in halves, remove the stones, 
weigh the peaches. For every pound of fruit allow one 
pound of sugar ; place the sugar and peaches in the pre- 
serving kettle with just a little water; crack some of the 
stones and put the meats with the fruit ; stew slowly and 
skim often; when the peaches are. clear remove them to a 
platter; let the syrup boil until thick, then strain it over 
the peaches ; when cold, place in glasses or jars, and cover 
with papers dipped in alcohol. 

BAKED PIE PLANT. 

Cut the pie plant into pieces about an inch long, put 
in a baking dish with an equal weight of sugar, cover 
closely and bake about one hour. 



268 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

QUINCE JELLY. 
Qiuirter and core the ripe quinces, throw them into 
cold water until all are prepared ; weigh, and allow one 
pint of water to each pound of fruit, simmer the fruit until 
it is very soft, be careful it does not burn, then strain 
through a jelly bag, do not squeese the bag; weigh the 
juice, put it in a preserving kettle, and boil rapidly for 
twenty minutes ; skim, then stir into it one pound of sugar 
to each pound of juice. If the fruit is very sweet three- 
fourths of a pound will answer. Boil for twenty or thirty 
minutes, stir constantly and skim carefully until the juice 
jellies in falling from the spoon ; then pour into jelly 
glasses, cover the next day with paper wet in alcohol, and 
then paper pasted over the tops. 

QUINCES PRESERVED IN SLICES. 
Pare and core and cut into thin slices the ripe quinces ; 
throw the slices into cold water until all are prepared. For 
every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a pound of 
white sugar. Put the quince slices into the preserving kettle 
with a very little water, cook the fruit for ten minutes, then 
add the sugar, which has been dissolved in as little water as 
possible. Cook together until the slices of fruit are soft and 
clear. When clear, put into glasses and the next day cover 
with papers wet in alcohol and covered Avith dry papers. 

EAST INDIA PRESERVES. 
One-half bushel of green tomatoes ; after washing and 
slicing them into round, rather thick slices, put them into a 
porcelain kettle and boil until they are a light, transparent 
green color. Drain off the water and measure the tomatoes ; 
take to each pound of tomatoes, one pound of sugar, three 
lemons cut into slices, five cents' worth of ginger root broken 
into small pieces ; boil all these well together until the 
mixture is very thick — but the pieces should keep their 
forms — remove from the fire. In four days boil the mixture 
again if it is not thick enough. This preserve need not be 
sealed in jars. 

SPICED TUTTI-FRUTTI PRESERVES. 
Scald twelve pounds of currants, rub them through a 
sieve to remove all seeds and stems ; after this add to the

powdered cinnamon, one-half teaspoonful of powdered 
mace. Stew slowly until quite thick. 

GRAPE JELLY. 
Pick the grapes from the stems, wash and mash them, 
cook until they are soft, then strain ; then boil this juice for 
for five minutes, then strain and add to one pint of juice 
one pound of sugar. Boil together for fifteen minutes. 

LEMON JELLY. 
One box of gelatine, soak in one pint of cold water for 
one-half hour ; add one quart of boiling water, one quart 
of sugar, the juice of eight lemons. Strain into a jelly 
mold. 

PRUNE JELLY. 
One pound of prunes, one-fourth pound of sugar, one- 
half a lemon, one ounce of gelatine, one-half pint of cream. 
Put the prunes into a saucepan with sufficient water to cover 
them, add the sugar and the peel of the lemon, stew gently 
two hours, pass through a wire sieve, add the gelatine, 
having previously soaked it in water. Crack the prune 
stones and put the kernels into the jelly ; boil all together 
for a few minutes and pour into a china mold which is the 
shape of a ring. Whip the cream and heap it up high in 
the center of the mold, and serve. 

WINE JELLY- 1. 
One box of gelatine, soak this in one pint of cold water 
for two hours, then add one quart of boiling water, one 
and three-fourths pounds of sugar, the juice of two lemons 
and one pint of sherry. 

WINE JELLY-2. 
One package of gelatine, soak for two hours or more 
in one cup of cold water, then add the juice of one lemon 
and a little of the grated rind, two cups of granulated sugar, 
two cups of boiling water, two cups of Catawba or sherry 
wine; let all soak together for an hour, then add tlie water 



270 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

and strain through a flannel bag; when all is strained put 
the liquid into a jelly mold and set on the ice to harden. 
If desired to serve with cream, put the jelly into a mold 
which has an open center; this center can be filled with 
whipped cream when ready to serve. 

RASPBERRY JELLY. 
To each pound of raspberry juice add one pound of 
sugar. Prepare the juice in the same manner as for currant 

jelly- 

RASPBERRY JAM. 
Select ripe, fresh fruit ; to each pound of fruit allow 
one pound of sugar ; mash the raspberries, add the sugar, 
and boil together until the jam is clear, thick, and smooth — 
remove all the scum as it rises, When cooked put into jelly 
glasses; cover when cold with papers dipped in alcohol, and 
on the outside put papers either pasted or tied down. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. 
Prepare in the same way as for raspberry jam. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. 

Take the hulls from the berries; if possible avoid wash- 
ing the berries — if it is necessary to do so be as expiditious 
as possible. Take one pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit; place the berries in preserving kettle, let them come 
to the boiling point slowly; boil for fifteen minutes, care- 
fully skim them, then place in small jars or tumblers; the 
next day cover with a paper wet in alcohol, and outside of 
this a white paper pasted down over the tops with a paste 
made of the white of an egg slightly beaten. 

TO STERILIZE FRESH FRUITS. 
Fill the jars with the fruit, which must be freshly 
ga-thered and fully ripe. Sprinkle white sugar over the 
fruit. Place the filled jars in a fish boiler, fill it half full of 
warm water; place a little straw between the jars. Bring 
the water to boiling and keep it at this point for fifty min- 
utes, keeping the boiler almost closed; scald the covers of 
the jars, place them on the jars as quickly as possible while 
the fruit is hot. 



PKESERVRS, ETC 271 

STRAWBERRIES PRESERVED IN THE SUN. 
Select fine, large berries, remove the hulls. To each 
pound of berries put three-quarters of a pound of white 
sugar, let the sugar remain over the berries for three hours, 
then place all in the preserving kettle and boil for ten 
minutes. At the end of that time carefully remove the 
berries from the syrup with a skimmer and place them on 
platters and put them in the sun. Cook the syrup until it 
is thick, then pour it over the berries. The next day pour 
off the syrup, re-heat it, pour it over the berries and put all 
in the sun. Keep the berries in the sun until all the syrup 
is absorbed, then put into glass jars and cover with papers 
wet in alcohol, and with dry papers pasted over. 

VEGETABLE MARROW PRESERVE. 

BOSTON SQJLIASH. 

Peel and remove the pulp and seeds, then cut into inch 
cubes, let no water be added, the juice of the marrow being 
sufficient moisture for the syrup — two pounds of marrow, 
two pounds of sugar, the juice of one lemon, the peel cut 
fine, three-fourths of an ounce of root ginger, one saltspoon- 
ful of cayenne pepper ; boil gently one and one-half hours ; 
when the syrup is transparent, add one-half of a wine glass 
of sherry, brandy or whiskey ; place in glasses and cover 
with papers wet in alcohol and an outer paper pasted over. 
Be careful to rub the marrow, not to wash it, should any 
earth adhere. 

WATERMELON PRESERVES. 
Sixteen pounds of watermelon ; remove the green rind 
•and the seeds, cut the melon into two-inch squares. Take 
one-half pound of sugar to every pound of fruit, place in 
kettle one layer of fruit, one layer of sugar, then let these 
stand over night ; next morning boil for four hours steadily, 
then add six lemons cut up into very small pieces and a 
little ginger root ; boil one-half hour longer. 

SYRUP. 
To every pound of white sugar allow one-half pint of 
water and one-half the white of an egg. Beat the egg until 
light, then put it, the sugar and water, into a clean sauce- 



372 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

pan, but let the sugar dissolve before putting on the fire. 
When the syrup boils, add one teacup of cold water, but do 
not stir it at all. Carefully remove all the scum as it rises, 
and when the syrup is clear it is ready for use. Put into 
glass jars and cover. It will keep for a long time. 

ORANGE SUGAR. 

Cut oflF the thin yellow rind of oranges, and dry it. 
When it is dry (it will take two days to dry) put into the 
mortar with one cupful of granulated sugar. Pound the 
mixture until it is a powder, then rub it through a very fine 
seive. The rind of twelve oranges will require two cupfuls 
of sugar. When very finely powdered, put into tight glass 
jars. One tablespoonful of this mixture is required for 
flavoring a custard or cake. 

Lemon Sugar can be prepared in the same manner as 
orange sugar. 

VANILLA SUGAR. 
One pound of powdered sugar, one ounce of Vanilla 
bean, split the bean, remove the seeds, pound well together 
with the sugar until fine, then bottle for use. 

FRIED APPLES. 

Slice the apples ; have the frying pan hot ; put in one 
tablespoonful of butter, then the apples ; sprinkle a little 
sugar among the apples ; fry slowly until a good brown. 



SALTED NUTS AND CANDY. 373 



SALTED NUTS AND CANDY, 



SALTED ALMONDS-i. 

Blanch one pound of freshly-shelled Jordan almonds 
by pouring boiling water over them. When they have 
stood covered for five minutes rub off" the skins of the nuts, 
one by one, with the finger and thumb. This process of 
removing the skin of the almond, called blanching, is easily 
accomplished if the water is actually boiling, not merely 
warm, when it is poured over them. For this purpose the 
nuts should be placed in a tin pan and left a moment on the 
stove after the boiling water is poured over them. They 
should all be covered in order that the skins of all shall be 
" started," so they will rub ofi" easily with the finger and 
thumb. Dry the blanched nuts with coarse towels, so as 
to absorb any moisture about them, and measure them by 
the pint. Allow two tablespoonfuls of the best olive oil or 
the same amount of melted butter to each pint. Toss the 
nuts, a pint at a time, until they are evenly or thoroughly 
coated with the oil, or melted butter, if you prefer it; Let 
the nuts stand closely covered in the closet, under the oven 
or in some such warm place for about an hour, until they 
have partly absorbed the oil about them. Dredge two table- 
spoonfuls of salt over them, and stir in order to distribute 
the salt evenly. Spread the almonds on tin biscuit-pans, or 
better still, on sheets of tin that fit the oven, and let them 
bake in the oven bottom until they are slightly colored or 
begin to be crisp. If the oven is hot, it will not take over 
ten or twelve minutes. It must not be too hot or they will 
burn. 

Salted almonds are served at dinner, with the cheese 
and crackers, or at an afternoon tea. They are sometimes 
chopped and put on chocolate loaf-cake. 



274 THK 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

SALTED ALMONDS— 2. 

Shell the nuts and blanch them by covering them with 
boiling water for a moment, then throw them into cold 
water in order to remove the skins. To one pint of nuts 
take one tablespoonful of olive oil or melted butter ; let the 
nuts stand in this for an hour, stir them occasionally, then 
drain and sprinkle the nuts with two tablespoonfuls of salt. 
Put into a moderate oven and bake until they are all a deli- 
cate brown. 

You can prepare peanuts and pine nuts in the same 
manner. 

SAL^^ED HICKORY NUTS. 
Proceed as for salted almonds — without blanching them. 

PECAN NUTS. 
Proceed as for salted almonds — without blanching them. 

NUT LOAF. 
Chop very fine one-half pound of nuts — almonds, pecan 
or hickory nuts, add one pound of bread crumbs, one-quarter 
of a^ pound of butter. Stir these into one pint of boiling 
water, add one egg well beaten, a little salt, pepper and a 
pinch of sage or any sweet herb. Mix well together. Butter 
a baking dish, pour in the mixture, sprinkle some fine crumbs 
and bits of butter on the top and bake for one hour in a 
moderate oven, then turn the loaf on a platter and garnish 
with celery tops or parsley. 

CARAMEL. 

One and one-half pounds of brown sugar, one-fourth 
pound of butter, one-fourth pound of chocolate (Baker's), 
one teacupful of milk. Boil twenty minutes, stir all the 
time, then add one tablespoonful of vanilla. Pour on 
buttered plates. 

CARAMELS. 

Two pounds of brown sugar, one cup of milk, piece of 
butter the size of an egg, one-half pound of chocolate. Boil 
between twenty and thirty minutes ; on taking off pour in 
the white of one egg well beaten ; flavor with vanilla ; beat 
six minutes, then cool.

276 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK, 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS, 



To provide a sick person with nutritious food, of the 
proper quantity and quality, is one of the most important 
requirements of good nursing. It is well known that drugs 
alone cannot take the place of food. In the often long con- 
valescent stage of illness resources are taxed to the utmost to 
prepare the proper food which shall be at the same time 
nourishing and tempting. 

The tray becomes a souixe of weariness and the question : 
" What shall I give the invalid?" a constantly recurring one. 
Milk is now given so generally that it is absolutely necessary 
to be able to prepare it in many different ways, for of no 
food will a patient weary sooner. Let the tray always 
present an inviting appearance, every napkin and dish be 
perfectly clean, the food arranged in an inviting manner. 
Special care should be given that any diet ordered to be 
served hot is really hot, and any diet to be served cold, is 
cold. 

The food should never wait in the sick room before 
being served, and the tray and contents be at once removed 
after the patient is fed. Attention to little details, trivial 
perhaps in themselves when one is well, but of great con- 
sequence to an invalid, will aid greatly towards the recovery 
of the patient. 

BEEF BROTH— I. 
A good beef broth is really much more nourishing than 
beef tea. To make the broth take a piece from the. neck, 
chop it and the bone quite fine, have more beef than bone. 
Take one pound of beef and one-third of a pound of bone, 
put one quart of cold water over the meat and bone, cover 
the pan and let it simmer for four hours ; remove all fat, 
put with the broth two stalks of celery and a little salt ; 
strain and serve a small cupful at a time. 



FOOD KOK INVALIDS. 2^7 

BEEF BROTH— 2. 

Take one pound of the leg of beef, trim oPt' all fat and 
pound the meat well, then put into tlie stew-pan with one 
quart of cold water, one small carrot cut fine, one onion 
sliced, a little salt, one blade of mace ; stir the broth until 
it boils, then skim carefully ; place on the back of the stove 
and let it simmer for two hours ; strain and serve. If put 
away to keep, be sure to remove all fat before warming it 
again. This should be done to all broths. 

The extracts of beef are nearly always made from the 
least nutritious part of the fresh meat, so that there is little 
left in it, but the flavoring matter and the salts, these serve 
to give an agreeable flavor and rich color, but no solid 
nourishment. 

liEEF ESSENCE. 
Tliis is much better for an invalid than beef tea. Take 
a good beefsteak from the round, say two pounds, cut it in 
small pieces, put into a Mason jar and set in the oven, in a 
pan of hot water; as the juice runs from the meat take it 
away at intervals and slightly salt it. One teaspoonful of 
this liquor is worth a pint of the ordinary beef tea. 

BEEF JUICE. 
Heat on the broiler a thick piece of steak, about one 
pound ; when hot, squeeze out the juice ; serve at once. 

RAW BEEF SANDWICH. 
Scrape the tender meat with a sharp knife, spread it 
on thin slices of buttered bread, season with a little salt; 
cut off the crusts and cut the sandwich from corner to corner, 
so as to make two small, three-cornered pieces. 

CLAM BROTH, 
Take twelve clams, boil them in their own litjuor for 
llfteen minutes, strain the liquor and serve. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 
Take an old chicken, cut it in pieces and put it in the 
saucepan with three pints of cold water, one tablespoonful 
of rice ; let the soup simmer slowly ; when the chicken is 



27S THE 3-6-5 COOK HOOK. 

thoroughly cooked, take from the fire, skim every bit of fat 
from the soup before serving ; season with salt and pepper. 

EGG BROTH. 

Beat an egg until it is frothy, stir into it a pint of 
boiling hot meat broth, free from fat, season it with a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and eat it hot, with thin slices of dry toast ; 
it may be given to assist the patient in gaining strength. 

MEAT BROTH. 

One pound of mutton, one pound of veal, one-half a 
chicken, one calf's foot, two quarts of water, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a little pepper; simmer for four hours, strain 
and put in a mold and keep on the ice until needed. Serve 
hot. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

One and one-half pounds of mutton, free from gristle, 
one quart of cold water, two tablespoonfuls of rice, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt; simmer for four hours, strain and 
serve a small quantity at a time to the patient ; serve very 
hot. 

BROTH MADE FROM THE SHEEP " TROTTERS." 

Take eight trotters with just a little of the lower part 
of the meat from the leg ; put them into four quarts of cold 
water and one cupful of rice ; let them simmer slowly for 
eight hours, add a little salt and take from the fire and 
strain. The next day take oft' every particle of fat and heat 
a little of the broth ; it should be given in small quantities 
and frequently. This is a very excellent broth for a weak 
stomach. A patient can retain it when all other broths or 
foods have failed. 

VEAL BROTH. 

Two pounds of perfectly lean veal, one-fourth pound 
of pearl barley; cut the meat into thin, small pieces; boil 
it and the barley together for three hours, boil slowly ; then 
strain through a sieve and add one-half teaspoonful of salt. 
This broth is light and nourishing, and easy of digestion. 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 379 

HAMBURG STEAK. 

Take one-half pound of good beef; scrape all the pulp 
from the fiber, season with a little salt and pepper, make 
into a small steak and broil over a clear fire, or cook 
on the skillet, which should be very hot before the meat is 
put on it. Three minutes will cook the steak. Place a 
small piece of butter on the steak, garnish with a little bit 
of parsley, and serve very hot. 

MILK OF EGGS. 

Beat the yolks of two fresh eggs with one-half table- 
spoonful of sugar and one teaspoonful of orange flower 
water; stir these into one-half pint of boiling milk or water. 
This must be taken hot, and is most soothing for a cold or 
cough. 

EGG AND PORT WINE. 

One fresh egg mixed with one tablespoon ful of cold 
water, then add one wine glass of Port wine, a little grated 
nutmeg. Put a teaspoonful of sugar into the sauce-pan and 
when hot, stir in the egg mixture and stir carefully. The 
mixture is then poured into a glass and served with a 
cracker. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Have the water in the sauce-pan boiling, add a little 
salt and one tablespoonful of vinegar. Break the eggs 
separately into a saucer, slip them into the water carefully ; 
do not let the water boil again. Pour some of the hot 
water over each egg wath a spoon, so as to make a thin 
white film over them. Take carefully from the fire ; place 
each egg on a piece of hot toast. Serve hot. 

EGGS POACHED IN BROTH, 

Have the broth hot in the sauce-pan, break very gently 
the eggs into it, cook three minutes, remove and put each 
egg on a slice of hot toast ; if the gravy is desired, thicken 
it with a little flour, add one teaspoonful of butter, strain 
around the egg. 



28o THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

POACHED EGGS IN MILK. 
Have the milk boiling hot, add a little salt, drop in the 
eggs carefully, one by one ; remove as soon as they are set ; 
place on hot toast, and serve at once. 

EGG-NOG. 

One egg beaten very light, one tablespoonful of sugar 
beaten into the egg, then add slowly one tablespoonful of 
brandy and one-half a cup of milk — -cream may be substi- 
tuted for the milk. 

BREAD JELLY. 
Remove the crust from the roll, slice the crumb and 
toast it ; put the slices in one quart of water, and set it over 
the fire to simmer until it jellies ; then strain it through a 
cloth, sweeten it, and flavor it with lemon juice ; put it into 
a mold and cool it upon the ice before using. 

CURRANT JELLY-WATER- , 
Dissolve one teaspoonful of currant jelly in a glass of 
cold water. 

CHICKEN JELLY. 
See chapter on Chicken. 

LEMON JELLY. 
Three lemons — juice only, one pound of white sugar, 
three pints of boiling water, one ounce of gelatine dissolved 
in the boiling water, then add the juice and sugar and strain 
into small molds. 

■RESTORATIVE JELLY. 
One half box of gelatine, one tablespoonful of granu- 
lated gum-arabic, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, two cloves, one-half a pint of 
port — soak all these together for two hours ; keep the basin 
covered; then put into a sauce-pan and cook, stirring con- 
stantly until everything is dissolved, then strain and place 
on the ice. This jelly is excellent where the patient is 
unable to swallow solid food or even liquid, for it melts 
slowly in the mouth. A tablespoonful of beef juice can be 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 28 1 

added when the jelly is taken from the fire, if a stimulent 
is desired. 

STRENGTHENING JELLY. 
One pint of port wine, one package of gelatine, three- 
fourths of an ounce of gum arable, one-fourth pound of rock 
candy. Place all in a basin and let the mixture stand all 
night ; the next morning put the basin in one of boiling 
water, stir constantly until the ingredients are dissolved, 
then strain through a jelly bag into a mold. 

SAGO JELLY. 
One cupful of sago soaked over night in cold water. 
Boil it in a double boiler for one hour, then uncover and let 
the water boil away ; add two cupful? of sugar and the juice 
of one lemon ; pour into the dish in which it is to be served 
to cool. Serve rich cream with jelly. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 
Wash one ounce of tapioca, soak it over night in cold 
water, and then simmer it with a bit of lemon peel until it 
is thoroughly dissolved. Sweeten it to taste, and let it cool 
before using. 

EGG PUDDING. 

One egg beaten until light, and one teaspoonful of flour 
which has been mixed smoothly into one tablespoonful of 
milk, add a saltspoonful of salt (be careful with the salt as 
many invalids dislike salt), strain into a buttered cup, and 
set into boiling water to simmer for twenty minutes. 

EGG TEA-i 

Beat the yolk of an egg in a cup of tea, and let the 
sick person drink it warm ; the yolk is more readily 
digested than the white, and has a better flavor; and the 
tea is a powerful respiratory excitant, while it promotes 
perspiration, and aids the assimilation of more nourishing 
foods. 

EGG TEA-2 

The white of one egg beaten into a stiff froth ; the yolk 
beaten light with one teaspoonful of sugar. Mix together

waters, then drop it into one pint of boiling water for five 
minutes. Pour off this water and add one quart of fresh 
boiling water ; put on back of stove and let it simmer for 
three hours, then strain and season with a little salt or 
sugar. Equal quantities of barley gruel and milk make a 
nourishing drink. 

EGG GRUEL-i. 

Beat well one egg, add a very little salt, one sprig of 
parsley ; stir this into one cup of boiling water, strain over 
small slices of hot toast. 

EGG GRUEL-2.

the yolks smooth and stir gradually into the yolks one cup 
of hot milk, and a little salt and serve in bowl. 

FARINA GRUEL. 

Stir two tablespoonfuls of farina into three tablespoon- 
fuls of milk ; pour this into one pint of boiling water, boil 
it until thoroughly cooked; stir frequently. Take from the 
fire, add one saltspoonful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of 
cream. 

FLOUR GRUEL. 

Put into a strong cotton cloth, one pint of liour, tie it 
up into a ball, boil for four hours, keep it well covered 
with water. When needed to use, have one pint of milk 
boiling in the double boiler, stir into it one tablespoonful of 
the flour-ball, (you scrape the ball and mix a little water 
with the flour), add one saltspoonful of salt and a little 
sugar if liked. This is an excellent remedy in cases of 
summer complaint. The ball will keep for months, if kept 
dry and cool.

little sugar and a little grated nutmeg. 

SAGO GRUEL. 
Soak one ounce of sago, after washing it well, in a 
pint of tepid water for two hours ; then simmer it in the 
same water for fifteen minutes, stirring it occasionally ; then 
sweeten and flavor it to taste, and use at once.

EGGS AND ORA'NGE JUICE. 

A palatable, nourishing drink for a person with weak 
digestion is made with the whites of two eggs beaten but 
not frothed, and the juice of one orange ; place on the ice 
until very cold. The white of an egg, beaten, slightly 
sweetened and ilavored with orange juice or a little vanilla, 
is also a good drink for an invalid ; all should be served 
very cold. 

WINE WHEY. 

Take one cup of new milk and boil, adding a cup of 
sherry. Then strain through a cheese cloth. 

MILK PREPARATIONS. 

Milk is of special value as a food for invalids ; it is 
easily taken, easily digested, and the diet is more under the 
control of the physician than other foods. Life can be 
supported for a long time on milk alone. 

"Milk contains all of the ingredients needed for 
nourishment ; it furnishes the materials needed which build 
up the body and keep it in repair, and also those which 
supply it with fuel to keep it warm and to furnish the 
animal machine with the necessary power to do its work. 
Skim milk has great value as a food when used in cooking 
or when taken with bread. Milk comes nearest to being a 
perfect food." 

BAKED MILK. 

Put the milk into a jar ; cover the top with white paper ; 
bake the milk in a moderate oven until thick as cream. 
This preparation of milk can be taken by the most delicate 
stomach. 

CLABBERED MILK. 

Fill a glass dish with milk, cover and let it stand until 
it is smooth and jelly like — in winter this may take three or 
four days, in summer, two generally. When the milk is 
clabbered, put the dish on the ice for an hour to chill it, 
do not disturb it. Serve with sweet cream and a little 
g rated nutmeg.

MILK WITH CHOCOLATE. 

Grate one ounce of chocolate ; mix it into a paste with 
a little cold milk, then stir it into one pint of boiling milk, 
add a little salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, and the well- 
beaten yolks of two eggs. Serve hot. 

CHICKEN MILK. 

Cut a chicken into small pieces, see that it is well 
cleaned in a careful manner, take off the skin, put the 
chicken into a sauce-pan which is either granite-ware or 
China-lined, add a tablespoonful of celery cut fine, a little 
sprig of parsley, four pepper-corns, one-half saltspoonful of 
salt; cover the meat with cold water and let it simmer until 
the meat is all in rags, then strain into a bowl; when cold, 
it should be a firm jelly. When needed, carefully wipe off 
every bit of fat fi'om the top of the jelly. Take equal quan- 
tities of jelly and fresh milk, boil them together, strain into 
a cup— one teacupful is sufKcient at a time. It can be used 
hot or allowed to again become cold and formed into jelly. 
A small strip of toast can be served with it if desired. 

CITRONIZED MILK JELLY. 

One quart of milk, three-fourths of a pound of pow- 
dered sugar, four lemons, one ounce of gelatine. Boil the 
milk, sugar and gelatine together with some of the lemon 
rind cut very thin, then put the mixture into a basin to cool ; 
add the juice of the lemon and stir until the milk is curdled, 
then pour into a mold and let the jelly set. The casein rises 
to the top ; when the jelly is turned out it occupies the base 
and the jelly the top. 

DIGESTED MILK. 

One pint of milk added while boiling hot, to one pint 
of cold milk, then add thirty grains of carbonate of soda, 
then one and one-half teaspoonfuls of Liquid Pancreaticus ; 
mix and let stand for three hours in an even temperature. 
This preparation can be used when Koumiss is not obtain- 
able. Take a large wine glassful at a time.

HOT MILK. 

Hot milk is one of the most nourishing things that can 
be given to a weak or exhausted patient, or to any one suf- 
fering from a severe chill. If it is absolutely necessary to 
add any other stimulant, add it after the milk is taken from 
the hre. The milk should never boil for hot milk. 

JUNKET. 

One pint of fresh milk, warm the milk slightly, then 
stir into it one teaspoonf ul of rennet liquor, or one teaspoon- 
ful of Prepared Pepsin^use only the best for preparing 
Junket. Stir the rennet liquor or the pepsin only enough 
to mingle it with the milk; the milk will thicken in a few 
minutes; place on the ice or in a cold place. Serve with 
sweet cream and sugar or with cream and a little nutmeg. 

LAB AN. 

One quart of new milk, one tablespoonful of yeast ; 
stir the yeast into the milk and let it stand for twenty-four 
hours — it will then be hard. Take a tablespoonful of this 
and stir into a quart of new milk and put it away to 
harden— this is Laban. To keep a supply, if needed, reserve 
a tablespoonful each day for the next preparation. Eat 
with sugar and cream. 

MILK SOUP. 
One quart of milk, one egg, one-half tablespoonful of 
flour, a little salt, one-half teaspoonful of sugar, a little 
lemon peel or a bit of cinnamon stick. Boil these together ; 
as soon as the mixture boils, remove from the fire and stir 
in the white of egg beaten very stifi". 

THICK MILK. 
Put into the stew-pan one tablespoonful of flour, one 
tablespoonful of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt. Mix together 
until a smooth paste with one pint of milk ; stir with a 
wooden spoon ; if too thick add more milk. Boil for fifteen 
minutes. The soup should be thick enough to coat the 
spoon. Add a little nutmeg if liked and serve. It is a 
digestible soup for young children. 



288 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

MILK WITH WHITE OF EGG. 

One cup of milk ; beat well with the milk the white of 
an egg ; put into a glass and serve ; add the milk slowly to 
the egg. The addition of a tablespoonful of clear coffee is 
sometimes relished by the patient — or the milk slightly 
salted. 

MILK SHAKE. 

Fill up a large glass two-thirds full of sweet milk, 
sweeten with syrup, or with the strained juice from any 
rich preserve, a few drops of vanilla can be added or a tea- 
spoonful of orange juice. Fill up the glass with pounded 
ice, place the mixture in the shaker and shake well, or pour 
from one glass to another until well mixed. 

BARLEY WATER. 

Wash two ounces of pearl barley in cold water until it 
does not cloud the water ; boil it for five minutes in half a 
pint of water ; drain that off, put the barley into two quarts 
of clean water, and boil it down to one quart. Cool, strain, 
and use. Pearl barley largely contains starcli and mucilage, 
and makes an excellent soothing and refreshing draught in 
fevers and gastric inflamations. 

CRUST COFFEE. 

Toast two slices of bread until very brown, break into 
small pieces, put one-half pint of the pieces into a pitcher 
and pour over them one and one-half pints of boiling water ; 
cover the pitcher, let it stand for ten minutes, then strain. 
Serve either hot or cold— a little milk can be added if liked, 
or the coffee can be made with boiling hot milk instead of 
water. 

FLAXSEED LEMONADE— i. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of flaxseed into a pitcher, pour 
over it one pint of boiling water ; let this steep for three 
hours on the back of the stove, then strain and add the juice 
of one lemon and one tablespoonful of sugar or more if 
desired ; if the lemonade is too thick, add more water. This 
is soothing for colds and fever. 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 289 

FLAXSEED LEMONADE— 3. 
Pour one quart of boiling water over four tablespoonfuls 
of whole flaxseed, and steep three hours, covered Then 
sweeten to taste, and add the juice of two lemons, using a 
little more water if the liquid seems too thick to be pala- 
table. This beverage is verj^ soothing to the irritated 
membranes in cases of severe cold. 

KOUMISS. 
Two quarts of milk slightly warmed, add two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and one-half of a two-cent cake of com- 
pressed yeast. Blend ingredients thoroughly, bottle and 
cork and tie corks down ; put in warm place for six hours 
and then in ice box for two days before using. 

ICELAND MOSS CHOCOLATE. 
Dissolve one ounce of Iceland moss in one pint of boil- 
ing milk ; boil one ounce of chocolate for five minutes in one 
pint of boiling water; thoroughly mix the two, and give it 
to the invalid night and morning. This is a highlv nutra- 
tive drink for convalescents. 

DRY TOAST. 

In making toast there is apt to be great carelessness 
and ignorance shown ; the bread is generally cut too thick 
and the slices are unevenly colored. Cut the slices thin and 
even ; it is a good plan to dry the slices before toasting, then 
place them on the toaster over a clear fire, and turn con- 
stantly so that the slices are well browned ; always serve 
toast hot, 

CREAM TOAST— I. 
Toast a slice of bread evenly and quickly ; dip it into 
boiling water, then sprinkle a little salt on it, and cover 
with rich hot cream. 

CREAM TOAST— 2. 
Prepare as for dry toast ; pour over a little hot water, 
which must be drained off in a few minutes ; then spread 
some butter and a little salt on the slices, and pour over 
some good rich cream ; place in a hot oven for a few minutes 
and serve at once. 



390 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

MARROW-BONE TOAST. 

Take two beef marrow-bones, cover each end with 
dough made with flour and water mixed together, boil the 
bones for an hour, then remove the dough, take out the 
marrow, spread on hot toast and season with salt and cay- 
enne, and serve hot. 

OYSTER TOAST. 
Chop very fine fifteen good oysters, add a little salt and 
pepper and a little nutmeg; beat two eggs with one table- 
spoonful of cream, heat and stir in the oysters, simmer 
together for five minutes, then pour the mixture over slices 
of hot, buttered toast. 

WATER TOAST. 
When the toast is ready, place in hot plate, pour over 
a little boiling water, spread a little butter evenly on top 
and a little fine salt, cover tightly for a few minutes to soak 
up the water, and serve immediately. 

OATMEAL WAFERS. 

Sift the oatmeal flour several times that it may be very 
fine ; take one quart of flour, mix it into a dough with cold 
water, add a little salt, work the dough until smooth, then 
roll it out very thin ; cut into squares or bake in one large 
sheet in a very cool oven. 

CHICKEN CREAM. 
Pound the breast of a cooked chicken to a smooth 
paste in the mortar; add some of the broth, one saltspoon 
of salt and a little pepper ; keep on the ice ; when required 
to use, heat a portion over hot water and add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream. 

CAUDLE. 
Put one-half a wine glass of wine into any plain gruel, 
flour or cracker ; stir it in while the gruel is hot, but not on 
the fire. 

CRACKERS AND MARMALADE.

put between them layers of orange marmalade, or any other 
preserve or jelly; put plenty upon the top cracker and set 
them in the oven for two or three minutes before serving. 
This makes a delicate and inviting lunch for convalescents. 

CUSTARD SAVORY. 

Mix the yolks of two eggs and the whites of one in a 

gill of white stock, put into a small jam pot, tie a piece of 

buttered paper over it and boil for one-fourth hour in a 

bain-marie. vServe either hot or cold with buttered toast. 

CUSTARD FOR AN INVALID. 

Three tabespoonfuls of milk, one egg beaten into the 
milk and one dessert-spoonful of fiour, which has been 
warmed and dried ; when the ingredients are thoroughly 
blended, strain into a buttered cup, place the cup in a pan 
containing hot water, cover the top of the cup with a wet 
cloth. Bake slowly for twenty minutes, then turn it on to 
a small dish — be careful not to break the custard — put a 
nice bit of butter on top, and a little fine sugar. 

CRACKERS AND CREAM. 

Pour boiling water over one large cracker, sprinkle a 
little salt over and cover the cracker a few minutes, then 
pour over some cream and serve. 

SOAKED CRACKERS. 
Cover a hard pilot biscuit with cold water, when the 
water is all absorbed, cover the cracker again with cold 
water and place in the oven ; when thoroughly heated, put 
a little salt on it and two tablespoonfuls of sweet cream. 

Cl'STARD BROTH. 
Four fresh eggs, beat them until smooth, then pour them 
into three teacupfuls of broth, either of chicken, veal or 
beef; strain and then fill four cups with the custard, place

SANDWICHES. 



HOW TO MAKE. 

Sandwiches may be made of white, brown or Graham 
bread. The bread should be at least twelve hours old and 
close grained. Spread each slice lightly and evenly with 
butter or mayonnaise dressing, as may be required, before 
cutting from the loaf; lay the slice on a flat surface to be 
spread with the sandwich mixture ; over this place another 
spread slice of bread and press them together with a broad- 
bladed knife. They may be cut into various shapes, the 
square, triangular or diamond form being the most in use. 
Round sandwiches are made by using a large sized biscuit 
cutter. Slices cut into squares large enough to roll make 
another variety. 

SARDINE. 
Sandwiches in any form are always welcomed. The 
following are a little different from the regulation sand- 
wiches. Remove the skin and bones from some sardines 
and chop them and add a small strip of cooked ham chopped 
very fine. Mix with these some paprika and mustard, a 
little tomato or walnut catsup to give it a flavor, and just 
enough vinegar to make the mixture into a thick paste. 
Spread a thin slice of bread with butter and with a layer of 
the mixture. Lay another slice of buttered bread upon 
this and again cover with the mixture. Repeat with three 
or four slices of bread, then take off all the crust and cut 
the bread down into thick slices as you would jelly cake. 

BROILED SANDWICH. 

A broiled sandwich is unusual and is exceedingly good, 
as well as being a nice mode of using underdone beef. 
Spread thin slices of Graham or white bread with butter 
and place between the slices rare beef chopped fine and 



SANDWICUKS. 



293 



seasoned witli salt and paprika. Place the sandwiches in a 
double broiler and brown the bread over a clear tire slowly, 
so that the meat shall have time to become heated. Lay 
the sandwiches upon a heated dish and brush the tops with 
hot butter. A horseradish sauce is often served with these 
sandwiches. 

CHEESE SANDWICH TO SERVE WITH SALID. 

Cut slices of bread thinly in finger lengths ; butter them 
and cut thin slices of Swiss cheese and place them between 
the slices ; season the cheese with a little cayenne ; dip the 
sandwiches in melted butter, place in the oven for a few 
minutes or until the bread is brown. Serve hot. 

POTTED CHEESE SANDWICHES. 
Pound together one-half pound of Cheshire cheese and 
five ounces of butter, a pinch of sugar. Stir into a stiff 
paste with a little white wine and spread evenly on hot 
toast. 

CAVIARE SANDWICHES— I. 
Spread caviare on bread and butter, squeeze lemon 
over it, and add a trifle of cayenne pepper. 

CAVIARE SANDWICHES— 2. 
Take a small box of caviare, turn it into a shallow dish 
and beat into it alternately, a little at a time, lemon juice 
and olive oil, and stir until you have a thick, white paste. 
Spread it thickly on bread. Over this scatter some finely 
chopped olives. 

CREAM CHEESE SANDWICH. 
Delicious sandwiches may be made with one cup of 
English walnut meats chopped very fine and mixed with 
enough Philadelphia cream cheese to make a paste. Add a 
little salt and spread on very thin bread. 

CELERY SANDWICHES. 
Boil two eggs fifteen minutes, throw them into cold 
water, remove the shells and rub the eggs through a course 
seive, add to them a cup of finely chopped celery and enough 
mayonnaise dressing to season it and make a paste. Spread 
on buttered toast. 



394 THE 3-6-3 COOK BOOK. 

CHERRY SANDWICH. 

Another sandwich to serve with punch or lemonade is 
made of candied cherries chopped fine and moistened with 
a Httle wine. Spread the mixture between water thin 
biscuits. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES. 
Chop the white meat of cold boiled chicken very fine, 
and mix with it enough highly seasoned mayonnaise dress- 
ing to make a paste, add to this a few chopped olives and 
spread between buttered slices of bread. Another chicken 
filling is made by chopping the chicken line with half as 
many blanched almonds as you have meat; season with salt 
and a dash of cayenne pepper. Moisten with a little cream 
until it is thin enough to spread nicely. This is excellent 
on brown bread. 

HOT CHEESE SANDWICHES, 
To prepare them slice the bread very thin and cut it 
round with a large sized biscuit cutter. Put a thick layer 
of grated cheese between the two circles of bread, sprinkle 
the cheese with salt and cayenne pepper and press circles 
of bread together. Fry them in a spider in equal parts of 
hot lard and butter. Brown them on each side and serve 
hot. 

FISH SANDWICHES, 
Graham bread is especially good for fish sandwiches. 
To make a sardine sandwich take three sardines and remove 
the skin and bones. Put them in a bowl with one teaspoon- 
ful of anchovy paste, the yolks of three boiled eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil and the juice of half a lemon. 
With the back of a spoon rub this mixture to a paste and 
spread on bread. 

FRIED SANDW^ICH. 
A delicious fried sandwich is made with stale bread and 
a bit of dry cheese — two things that can usually be found in 
one's larder ; cut the bread thin and spread it with French 
niustard ; cover this with a thick layer of grated cheese and 
sprinkle with salt and a dash of cayenne. Press the slices 
of bread well together and cut them into any shape desired. 



SANDWICHES. 295 

Have equal parts of lard and butter heated to boiling point 
in a frying pan ; put in the bread sandwiches and cook both 
sides brown and serve very hot. These sandwiches may be 
varied by scattering a little minced ham or chopped parsley 
over the cheese. 

HOT SANDWICH. 
Here is another mode of utilizing stale bread. Graham 
or white can be used; cut it into rather thick slices and 
lightly toast them, cutting them into any fancy shape. To 
three-quarters of a cup of chopped ham or tongue add a 
little grated cheese, some chopped parsley, a tablespoonful 
of cream and the yolk of a beaten egg. Mix these 
ingredients well together and spread thickly upon the 
toasted bread and sprinkle a little grated cheese over the 
top. Place the pieces in a baking pan, put them into a hot 
oven and brown well. 

HAM SANDWICHES. 

One can of deviled ham, soften with rich cream and 
one glass of sherry. Spread on thin bread and butter. 

LETTUCE SANDWICH. 
Cut the bread very thin and stamp round with a biscuit 
cutter ; spread thickly with mayonnaise dressing, and lay 
white crisp lettuce leaves on the dressing between the 
slices, letting the lettuce leaves come beyond the slices; 
press the upper piece of bread over the lettuce and trim 
the leaves with sharp scissors to make them even on all 
sides. Watercress may be used in the same way. 

OLIVE SANDWICH. 
Chopped olives mixed with a little mayonnaise dressing 
are a popular filling for sandwiches at five o'clock teas, as 
well as brown or white bread cut very thin, and buttered 
and spread with almonds, walnuts or Pecan nut meats 
pounded to a paste with a little salt. 

RAISIN SANDWICHES. 

Raisin sandwiches are excellent to serve with lemonade. 
With a pair of sharp scissors cut large raisins in two, 
lengthwise, and remove the seeds. Lay the fruit closely 



296 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

together between thin buttered bread and cut into fancy 
shapes. 

MAYONNAISE WITH OLIVES. 
Cut with the pastry cutter some rounds of thin, white 
bread ; spread with mayonnaise sauce, in which mix 
chopped olives. 

COLD ROAST BEEF SANDWICH. 
A hearty sandwich that most men are fond of is made 
thus : Chop very fine cold rare roast beef, and to one cup- 
ful of meat add one-fourth of a teaspoon ful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of tomato catsup, and the same amount of 
Worcestershire sauce and of melted butter, stir until well 
blended and spread on thin slices of bread. Or thus : To 
half a cupful of thick mayonnaise add two spoonfuls of 
whipped cream, a dessertspoonful of grated horseradish, 
and two of chopped cucumbers. Spread the bread with 
this mixture, and then with a thin layer of finely chopped 
rare beef and cover with more dressing and bread. 

SPANISH SANDWICHES. 
Butter some slices of fresh brown bread, and sprinkle 
on each slice a little cayenne, then put some boned an- 
chovies, laying them flat, and sprinkle over all the yolk of 
an egg cooked hard and rubbed through a sieve, some finely 
minced cold chicken, and a little chopped parsley; place 
the other slices of bread over, press them well together, cut 
into rounds and serve garnished with sprigs of parsley. 

LEBERWURST SANDWICHES. 

Spread the leberwurst on slices of rye bread, do not 
use butter. Leberwurst is a German sausage made of 
goose's livers, truffles, etc. Scoop out of the sausage skin. 

TOMATO SANDWICH. 
Cut thin slices of bread and butter evenly, then cut 
them into rounds with a biscuit cutter, lay on one slice of 
the bread a slice of ripe tomato, sprinkle the other slice 
with grated cheese, season with salt and pepper; press the 
two slices together. 



SANDWICHES. 297 

FISH SANDWICH. 

Use any cooked fish, free from bones, spread the slices 
of bread with butter; mix the fish with finely chopped 
pickle and mayonnaise, and spread on the bread. 

SAUSAGE SANDWICHES. 

Take the small link sausage, split them lengthwise and 
broil on each side. When they become cool, cover buttered 
bread with delicate lettuce leaves and lay the sausage upon 
them ; then the thinnest possible slices of cucumber pickles, 
and lastly a piece of buttered bread. Cut them into small 
squares. 

It may well be said of sandwiches that their name is

BEVERAGES. 



APPLE TODDY. 
Two tumblers of boiling waters, two tumblers of white 
loaf sugar, one tumbler of best brandy, one-half tumbler of 
peach brandy, one-half tumbler of Jamaica rum. Remove 
the cores from ten apples, bake them. Mix the sugar well 
in the boiling water first, and then add the other liquors, 
then the apples ; this is better made the day before it is to 
be used. 

BONUM. 

Three-fourths quart of whiskey, one gill of Vermouth, 
one-third wine glass of orange bitters, thirty drops of 
Angostora bitters, one wine glass of Benedictine, one wine 
glass of Curacoa, one glass of rock candy syrup. 

COCKTAIL A LA SHERRY. 
Equal portions of Old Tom gin and Vermouth, small 
portion of orange bitters, a dash of Marischino. 

CHOCOLATE. 
"Time and experience, those two great masters, have 
proved that, when properly prepared, chocolate is whole- 
some, nourishing and easily digested ; and also that it is 
most suitable for those who have much brain work — for 
clergymen, lawyers, literary men, and, above all, for 
travelers." — Brillat-Savarin. 

ARABIAN CHOCOLATE. 
One-half pound of French chocolate, one pound of rice 
flour, one-fourth pound of arrowroot, one-half pound of loaf 
sugar pounded fine. These should be well mixed together; 
a tablespoonful may be slightly wet with milk or water, 
then stirred into one pint of boiling milk and boiled for five 
minutes. It can be served either hot or cold. 



HE\'ERACiKS. 399 

CHOCOLATE. 

To one quart of boiling milk take four ounces of 
chocolate ; put the chocolate into a small pan on the fire, 
add three tablespoonfuls of cold water; stir together until 
the chocolate is thick and smooth, then stir it into the boil- 
ing milk ; add three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir for five 
minutes and serve hot. If desired, put on the top of each 
cup one spoonful of wliipped cream. One teaspoonful of 
sherrv to each cup greatlv improves the chocolate. 

FILTERED COFFEE. 

Allow one and one-half tablespoonfuls of ground coffee 
to each person. Put the coffee into the filter and pour over 
the boiling water slowly, allowing one cup of water for each 
person ; after all the w'ater has gone through the coffee pour 
it all through the second time. 

COFFEE FOR FIVE PERSONS. 

One cup of coffee before being ground, half egg, two 
quarts of boiling water. Beat one egg with two table- 
spoonfuls of cold water. Grind the coffee, put one-half the 
egg on the grounds, then wet it thoroughly with cold water 
so that every grain will be wet. Pour the boiling water 
on, boil about ten minutes after it comes to a boil. The 
other Iialf of the egg will answer for the next coffee,. 

Note. — Put all the water on the coft'ee that is required, 
as it spoils the coft'ee to add water after. The water should 
be perfectly fresh, and the coft'ee should be used as soon as 
it has boiled. 

The coft'ee should be placed on the hottest part of the 
range, or gas stove, so that it \vill boil as quicklv as 
possible, watching it constantly (hat it may not boil over. 

The coft'ee pot should never be washed with soap, or a 
dish cloth, simply rinse it out thoroughly with cold water, 
then with boiling water ; turn the pot upside down to dry. 
Never use a towel to dry it. 

Use a wooden spoon or ladle, and never use anything 
else; rinse and dry as soon as you are through with it. 
Never let the coft'ee pot stand with coffee in it.

COCOA. 

Full directions come with all the various preparations 
offered in the leading grocery houses. 

"VERY BEST EGG-NOG." 

Eighteen eggs ; beat the yolks until very smooth with 
enough sugar to make the mixture sweet, add very slowly 
in a thin thread stream one pint of brandy and one pint of

USEFUL HINTS. 305 



USEFUL HINTS. 



ECONOMY. 

Never go in for that sort of seeming saving which 
consists in the use of cheap materials either in meats, 
groceries or fats ; the best articles are the cheapest in 
the end. Economy is a good and a splendid quality, 
but it must be intelligent economy. The avoidance of 
waste in every department of the kitchen, larder and pantry 
is the only true economy. Never allow the least scrap to 
go to loss, but strive to turn even the scraps to some good 
use. Scrupulous cleanliness is indispensible. Clealiness in 
everything, vegetables carefully washed and rinsed, every 
utensil invitingly clean. 

BROWNED FLOUR. 
Put some sifted flour into a pan, place it on the stove 
and stir constantly from the bottom, whenever it begins to 
stick — do not let it burn, but when well browned, it is 
done. Put in a tin canister or glass jar to keep until 
needed. 

TO CLEAN CURRANTS. 
The best way is to sprinkle them with flour and rub 
them until the grit, stems and flour are removed ; then put 
them in the strainer and let the water run through them 
until it is perfectly clear; then dry the currants on a coarse 
towel. 

SWEET HERBS. 
Many recipes call for ''Sweet Herbs;" the proper 
mixture is : One part marjoram, two parts thyme, and 
three parts parsley. It is a wise precaution to dry bunches 
of these herbs carefully, sift them through a sieve, and mix 
in the above proportions and bottle ready for use. 



306 TTIK 3-6-5 COOK HOOK. 

Add a pinch of salt when whipping the whites of 
eggs. 

A little sugar is a great improvement to soups. 
Add a little salt to sweet dishes. 

Beat the yolks of egfgfs until they are a light lemon 
color. 

Put one teaspoonful of hot water always into the yolk 
of an egg when used for breading^ wuth crumbs and eggs. 

In making hard sauce add the powdered sugar slowly, 
a little at a time. 

Always fold in the whipped whites of eggs, into cake 
batter or other batters, rather than to beat them in. 

Always strain any mixture of flour and milk or water 

to avoid lumps and always add milk or water a little at a 
time in mixing any thickening. 

MEAT. 

Never place meat directly on the ice in the refrigerator ; 
the water draws out the juices of meat. 

Never allow meat to remain in the paper in which it 
is brought from the butcher, or in the hot kitchen ; put it 
at once in a cool place. 

All meat that has been hung long must be carefully 
scraped and washed off with vinegar and water before 
using — the outer skin may have acquired a stale taste. 

All warmed-over meats, if fried, should either be 
breaded or else dipped into batter and fried. The batter, 
or egg and bread crumbs form a crust and keep the meat 
tender and juicy; if cold meat is fried without either, it is 
always hard and stringy. 

Meat is cooked in "its own juice," by placing the piece 
in a stone jar with a cover, without any water, and letting 
it cook on the back of the stove slowly and gently. 

All meats cooked at a low degree of heat are rendered 
tender and palatable. 

In broiling either meats or fish, be sure that the 
gridiron is perfectly clean, and that it is rubbed with good 
fat, and is hot before using. 



usKi-ri, nixrs. 



y^i 



In broiling, no thin pieces should be broiled, only thick 
iieshy pieces. No forks should ever be stuck into them 
nor should they be cut with a knife. You may sprinkle 
your steak or chop Avith a little pepper, but never add the 
salt till the meat is done. 

Cold beef cut in slices, covered with vinegar over ni^rht 
then dipped in egg well seasoned with salt and nutn?eg' 
rolled in bread crumbs, fried, makes a very good lunch dish! 

Always rub the broiler or gridiron with fat before usin^ 
and always have it hot before putting on the meat or ^th 
to be broiled. Broiling requires a brisk fire, free from 
smoke. 

A mixture for croquettes can be made and moulded 
and the croquettes kept in a cool place until needed, when 
they are easily cooked. 

Always see that the oven is hot one hour before baking • 
meat is spoiled in a cool oven. 



It IS indispensible to good cooking that every dish 
requiring to be served hot should not wait in the kitchen, 
but should be served with promptness. 

Remember that wine increases the taste of salt For 
this reason where wine is used for flavoring, very little 
sa t shonld be put in until after the wine has been used 
when more may be added if necessary. 

If the w^ater is hard water, a little pinch of soda should 
be added to soften it for cooking purposes. 

TO KEEP MEATS UNTAINTED. 
Put a piece of charcoal inside of any poultry to be kept 
over night in summer; when meat has a close or slightly 
tainted smell wash it in w^ater in which is dissolved a tea- 
spoonful of soda, or in water and vinegar mixed. 

Keep lemons in a crock HHed wit!i cold water. 

Put oyster shells into a stove that is clinkered. Put in 
w lien the hre is hot. 

EGG STAIN. 

vSalt will remove the stain on egg spoons. 



-^oS THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

TO THICKEN WITH CORNSTARCH. 

Corn starch is used to thicken soups or sauces because 
it makes a smoother thickening, but it should be cooked for 
fifteen minutes — ordinary flour requires five minutes to cook. 

MUSHROOM POWDER. 

Mushroom powder can be successfully used in place of 
fresh mushrooms in scrambled eggs and omelettes. 

TO REMOVE MORTAR AND PAINT. 
Mortar and paint may be removed from window glass 
by washing the glass with strong, hot vinegar. 

TO KEEP A CHEESE FRESH. 
Wring out a cloth in cider vinegar, wrap it around the 
cheese, cover with a paper bag and keep the cheese in a dry, 
cool place. The cheese will retain its freshness and will 
not mold. 

Serve cream cheese with figs. 

Figs may be freshened by washing them thoroughly, 
drying and then heating them in the oven — take out and roll 
in powdered sugar. 

TO KILL COCKROACHES. 
Helebore sprinkled about on the floor of the rooms 
infested by cockroaches, will kill the pests; they eat it and 
will be poisened. Be sure to sweep the helebore up every 
morning. 

TO REMOVE BLACK BEETLES. 
Try fresh cucumber peelings where black beetles and 
cockroaches haunt. 

TO FRY BREAD TO SERVE WITH SOUP. 

Cut some slices one-fourth of an inch thick from a stale 
loaf, pare off the crust and divide the bread into small dice ; 
put in the pan— for one-half pound of bread a tablespoonful 
of butter ; when it is hot put in the bread, and fry until it is 
colored a pale brown ; drain from the butter and keep warm 
until served. 



USKKITL HINTS. 309 

FRIED BREAD FOR SOUP. 

Cut stale bread into thin slices and moisten them with 
milk, then cut into dice, put in a pan and fry in butter unl il 
brown. 

CROUTON.S FOR SOUP. 
Cut some slices of bread into small dice and fr\- in a 
little hot butter until of a light brown color. 

BREADING AND RASPING— i. 

For breading, use beaten eggs, oil and crumbs of either 
cracker or stale bread; if bread is used, rub the crumbs 
through a sieve, dry in the oven, and place in a tin box 
until ready to use. In breading, the eggs should be well 
beaten ; for three eggs, add one tablespoonful of oil, one 
tablespoonful of water, a saltspoonful of salt and a pincli of 
pepper. 

"Raspings'' are made from crusts of bread baked to a 
bright golden color, then crushed with the rolling pin, 
passed throug a sieve, aud put by for use— the coarse crumbs 
bein"g used to sprinkle over roast birds, etc. 

BREADING— 2. 

In preparing the crumbs for breading any articles, to 
successfully cover the articles, you must use a quantity of 
crumbs — there should be a quart or more of prepared crumbs 
on the board. 

CRUMBS. 
Mix crumbs with a little melted butter before putting 
on the top of any dish. 

CRACKER CRUMBS. 
Crackers should be made hot, then rolled and sifted, 
rolled and sifted again, until they are very fine; all crumbs 
for breading should be made very fine before using. 

MUSH. 

Put mush for frying into baking powder tins. You 
can slice the mush in round slices which will present a very 
appetizing appearance. 



3IO TIfE 3-6-5 COOK I500K. 

BREAD CRUMBS.. 

Save all pieces of bread. The large slices can be used 
for toast ; small pieces be used in puddings or dried for 
crumbs. Use the white part and crusts separately, dry in 
oven, sift, then put away in glass mason jars. 

CAKE CRUMBS. 

Stale cake is useful in making ^'arious puddings. 

TO CLEAN FRUIT. 
The best way to remove sand and grit from small fruits, 
when washing them is necessary, is to lay the fruit loosely 
in a clean wire basket and dip the basket into fresh water 
several times, then let the fruit drain before using. 

TO CHOP PARSLEY. 

In chopping parsley, after it is very tine, wash it, then 
place in the corner of a napkin and wring it dry ; the pars- 
ley will, after this, sprinkle easily over any dish for which 
it is required. 

TO CLEAN IRON KETTLES. 
A little vinegar and salt, boiled in an iron skillet or 
spider, will remove all burned and black spots. 

TO PREPARE GELATINE. 

Gelatine must be soaked in cold water first, then dis- 
solved in hot water. 

LEFT OVERS. 

Never throw away any of the cereals left over from 
breakfast, they are improved by long cooking, and can be 
added to the supply for the next morning, or they can be 
sliced and fried. 

Save all the vegetables left from dinner. They can be 
used to make a salad with either a French dressing or may- 
onnaise, or they can be used in the soup the next day. 
Save all the bits of meat which are trimmed from the roast 
or steak and all bones ; use these for the soup stock. Clarify 
all bits of suet, and other fat bones to use for frying. Grate 
all the bits of cheese and put into a clean jar to serve on 
crackers or toasted bread, or to use with macaroni. 



ILSKKUL HINTS. 



CHOPPING SUET. 



Always add a little flour when chopping suet to pre- 
vent the suet from oiling and sticking together. 

TO CLEAN SILVER. 

vSilver that has been laid away, and has become tar- 
nished, can be cleaned quicker if the whiting used to clean 
with is moistened with sweet oil before applying to the 
silver. Afterwards, dry whiting can be used as usual. 

Grease all pans and molds with butter, dripping or lard, 
using a small brush. 

TO KEEP FOOD WARM. 

When it is required to keep some dish already prepared 
warm for a time before serving, place in a pan of hot water. 

TO CLEAN KETTLES. 

When any kettle has become black and burned, 
boil in it a solution of sal soda for an hour or more. Use 
soda to soften the grease on pans, and scour with Sapolio. 

TO CLEAN DRAINS. 

Pour a solution of concentrated lye down the drain 
pipe of the kitchen sink at least twice a week, to prevent 
the grease stopping the pipe. 

THE REFRIGERATOR. 

See that the refrigerator is kept absolutely clean, 
the drain pipe kept open by washing the refrigerator out 
three times a week with cold water with soda or borax 
dissolved in it. 

STEAMING VEGETABLES. 

Many vegetables can be steamed or stewed in the oven 
when the top of the range is full. After preparing them, 
place them in an earthenware jar with a spoonful of water 
and a very little butter. Cover the jar and stand it in a 
sauce pan of water or the jar can stand in the oven: Green 
peas, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, all can be so cooked. 



312 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

PUT AWAY UTENSILS. 
In cooking, try to clear up all utensils used as you go 
on ; do not allow all to accumulate. Wash and put each 
one back in its place. Neatness, order and method should 
be observed in every kitchen. 

DRIED FRUITS. 

Dried fruits are better stewed in a double boiler, or 
baked in an earthen jar in the oven, using as little water as 
possible, the fruit to be closely covered. Always carefully 
look over all dried fruits before cooking them, then soak 
them for two or three hours in cold water, or until they are 
soft and swollen to their full extent, when they should be 
stewed in the same water; add the sugar just before they 
are fully cooked. 

Apple sauce is vastly improved by being baked in an 
oven instead of being stewed. 

LIME WATER. 
To make lime water, frequently needed for an invalid's 
or a child's use, put one pound of unslacked lime into a 
large bowl ; pour over this three quarts of boiling water ; let 
it stand for fifteen minutes, then stir it well with a stick. 
Place the bowl in a cool place for several hours ; at the end 
of the time pour off the clear water and bottle it. A tea- 
spoonful may be added to a glass of milk in case of an acid 
stomach, or to render the milk more easy of digestion. 

BURNS. 
In case of a burn, cover the place with bicarbonate of 
soda (salaratus) and bind over it a soft cloth ; this will re- 
lieve by keeping the air from the burnt place. As soda is 
in all kitchens this is a convenient remedy. Lime water 
also is an excellent remed}-. Wet cloths in it and place over 
the burn. 

ORANGE SUGAR. 

Cut oft" the thin yellow rind of oranges, and dry it. 
When it is dry (it will take two days to dry) put it in the 
mortar with one cupful of granulated sugar. Pound the 
mixture until it is a powder then rub it through a very fine 
sieve ; the rind of twelve oranges will require two cupfuls 



ITSEFUL HIXTS. 



313 



of sugar ; when very finely powdered put into tight glass 
jars. One tablespoonful of thi.^ mixture is required for 
flavoring a custard or cake. 

LEMON SUGAR. 

Lemon sugar can be prepared in the same manner as 
orange sugar, 

VANILLA SUG.AR. 
One pound of powdered sugar, one ounce of vanilla 
bean ; split the bean, remove the seeds, pound well 
together with the sugar until fine, then bottle. 

MERINGUES. 
In making a meringue, after beating the whites of the 
eggs until they are very stiff, add the sugar to the whites, 
beating it into the whites with a silver spoon, a little at a 
time ; add the flavoring at the last ; the white of one egg 
requires one tablespoonful of sugar. A meringue should be 
baked in a slow oven, 

ONION JUICE, 
When onion juice is required, pare the onion and cut 
it in four pieces if a large onion, and squeeze the pieces in 
a wooden lemon sqneezer ; keep the squeezer for this use 
only. Or the onion can be pressed against a coarse grater 
and the juice extracted. 

TO KEEP MEATS. 

Meat can be kept in summer for a longer time if it is 
thoroughly rubbed over with olive oil ; steaks should be 
dipped in oil or melted butter or dripping, and then hung 
up. 

Meat can be rubbed with ginger, every crevice filled, if 
desired to keep it for a few^ days. 



When sponges have become soft and sour rub into 
them some lemon juice, then rinse several times in luke 
warm water and dry. 

Wash old gflass jars in hot water in which is dis- 
solved a tablespoonful of baking soda; after, rinse well in 
cold water. 



3 '4 



THE ^-6-q COOK BOOK. 



Flat irons that are rusty can be cleaned by rubbing 
them with wax tied in a cloth, the irons to be warm ; then 
rub them well on a board strewn with salt. 

Ink spots can be removed from the fingers by a little 
ammonia. 

A little ammonia and alcohol mixed, rubbed on black 
silk will remove the ''shiny'^ look^ so often seen on seams 
of dresses. 

TO WASH BLANKETS. 

To each pailful of rain water use one tablespoonful of 
borax. 

Fill the wash boiler with water ; cut into small pieces 
two cakes of any good white soap. When this is dissolved 
and the water boiling, strain into the washtubs through 
cheese cloth. 

Put in the blankets ; do not mix the colored borders ; 
put all of one color together; let the blankets remain in 
the water over night ; cover the tubs. The water should 
be made tepid before the blankets are put into it, so cold 
rain water can be added to the hot water. 

The next morning rinse the blankets up and down in 
the water by holding the ends and going all around the 
four sides ; then have the wringer set very loosely and wring 
the blankets into another tub containing clean cold rain 
water. Rinse the blankets in this the same as in the first 
water; then wring into another tub of cold water; wring 
again into a third tub ; from this water take the blankets — 
do not wring them ; hang them on the lines dripping wet 
in the hot sun, changing them twice ; that is, turning them 
upside down twice. The blankets will be beautifully soft 
and clean after they are dry.

with the soda and camphor in the turpentine. Then add

TO RESTORE THE "PILE" ON VELVET. 

To restore the "pile" on velvet hold the velvet over 
boiling water the wrong side next to the steam, brush the 
velvet lightly as the steam goes through the fiber. 

PAPER BAGS. 

The large paper bags which are made for holding 
banana bunches are very nice for holding blankets and 
other woolens, which require to be put away from moths 
in summer.

One-half pint of alcohol, one-half pint of distilled 
water, one ounce of aqua ammonia. Mix and bottle.

316 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CLEANSER FOR WOOLENvS. 

One-fourth pound of white castile soap, one-fourth 
pound of ammonia, one ounce of ether, one ounce of 
alcohol. Cut soap very find and dissolve thoroughly in 
warm water, one quart ; add four quarts of soft water, then 
the other ingredients. Bottle at once. 

COLD CREAM— I. 

The woman who wishes to be sure that the ingredients 
of her cold cream are absolutely pure can make it herself 
with but little trouble. 

The butcher's and not the druggist's is the place to seek 
for the basis. Secure from him some fine white tallow. 
Cut into bits, put it into a saucepan without any water; set 
the sauce-pan in a jar of boiling water and let all remain 
until the fat is thoroughly "tried" out of the tallow. Strain 
through a fine sieve and while still warm stir in a teaspoon- 
ful of the essence of camphor to every cup of tallow. Next 
a tablespoonful of your favorite perfume and stir until the 
whole is a sweet smelling liquid. Before it has had time to 
cool pour into a little toilet jar and set upon the ice over 
night. It will keep indefinitely and will be found a deli- 
cious remedy for all the ills that winds and weather bring 
to the feminine skin. ( 

COLD CREAM— 2. 

Four ounces of oil of almonds, one and one-half ounces 
of white wax, one and one-half ovmces of spermaceti, one 
and one-half ounces of rose water, one and one-half ounces 
of glycerine. Melt these together over a gentle heat ; \vhen 
blended, stir until the mixture is cold ; place in small porce- 
lain jars and cover. 

PERFUMED BAGS FOR THE BATH. 

Mix together five pounds of oatmeal, one-half pound of 
pure Castile soap powdered fine, one pound of powdered 
orris root. Make small cheese cloth bags and fill with the 
mixture ; fill the bags loosely, and sew up one end ; put in 
the bath and use in place of sponge. 



l^SKFUL HINTS. 



FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 



5't 



One-half ounce of gum benzoin, three and one half 
ounces of rose water, one-fourth ounce of glycerine. Mix 
together and bottle. Or eqnal parts of glycerine, rose water 
and spirits of camphor. Rub a little on the hands after 
washing and before drying them. 

TO CLEAN RUSTY METALS. 

Clean with kerosine, which is better than oxalic acid 
for brass or copper ware. Kerosene is harmless, while 
oxalic acid is poisonous. 

PASTE. 

In making a paste either with tiour or starch, add a 
little oil of cloves or of winter green, and the paste will not 
sour or mold. 

A SPICE PLASTER FOR SEVERE PAIN. 

One teaspoonful of ground cloves, one teaspoonful of 
ground cinnamon, one teaspoonful of ground ginger, one 
teaspoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful of ground allspice, 
one teaspoonfnl of wheat flour. Mix well together ; pour 
over the mixture enough boiling water to moisten ; stir until 
smooth and spread on cheese cloth, and apply as hot and as 
quickly as possible. 

TO WASH FANCY WORK. 

In all cases of embroidery on linen, the work should be 
carefully pressed when finished, and it is important for 
every embroiderer to know how this niay be done in the 
simplest and safest manner. The proper way to press the 
finished work is to lay the embroidery face down on a 
clean cloth spread over an ironing blanket or two or three 
thicknesses of flannel ; place a thin dampened cloth on the 
back of the article to be pressed, and then use a hot iron 
deftly on the wet surface until it is perfectly dry. A steam- 
ing process is thus engendered, whereby the embroidered 
linen is rendered smooth and the effectiveness of the work 
much enhanced. 



318 TMK 3-6-5 COOK HOOK. 

TO SOFTEN SHOES. 

Shoes that have become stiff and uncomfortable by 
being worn in the rain or that have been lying unused for 
some time, may be made soft and pliable by using vaseline 
well rubbed in with a cloth and rubbed off with a dry cloth. 

TO REMOVE THE SMELL OF PAINT. 

Put a pint of clean, cold water with a slice of lemon 
in it, in the newly painted room. Change the water every 
three or four hours and the unpleasant odor will be taken 
away. 

A FEW LESSONS FOR THE COOK. 

Teach your cook to have a place for everything and to 
put everything in its place. 

Cleanliness, economy and punctuality are necessary. 

Keep all dry stores, such as sugar, rice, etc., in clean, 
dry, covered tins. 

Never pour the water in which greens or cabbage has 
been cooked, down the kitchen sink. Throw it outside ; 
but if this is not possible, at once flush the sink with hot 
water in which some common washing soda has been dis- 
solved. This prevents the odors from pervading the house. 

Never bang the oven door when cake or bread is being 
baked. 

Put in all soiled saucepans some hot water and a small 
lump of washing soda, until there is time to wash and dry 
them. 

When gas stoves are used, insist that the burners are 
turned out as soon as a dish is cooked. A large saving of 
gas will be the result. 

JARELLE WATER. 

Remember never to use Jarelle water on anything 
colored ; use only on white goods. 



I'SKKUL HINTS. 



319 



TO REMOVE A SCORCH MARK FROM LINEN. 
Slice a large onion, pound it well, then add to the 
juice one ounce of white soap and one ounce Fuller's earth 
and one pint of vinegar. Boil these together, and spread 
the mixture on the scorched linen and leave it on until dry, 
when the article must be well washed in soap suds. 

USES OF TURPENTINE. 

Spirits of turpentine will restore the brilliancy to 
patent leather. Boots and bags look almost new under its 
influence. 

Applied to a burn where the skin is not broken, it 
gives quick relief. 

It sends down the skin of a blister and prevents sore- 
ness. 

Workmen's white overalls and artists' working aprons 
should be steeped in turpentine for twenty-four hours before 
washing to loosen and remove paint. 

A little added to the steeping water (a tablespoonful 
to a gallon) will make linen beautifully white. 

A flannel dipped in hot water and sprinkled with 
turpentine will relieve hoarseness. This application is also 
often ordered for the relief of lumbago and rheumatism. 
It generally relieves neuralgia in the face. 

A few drops in boxes and cupboards will prevent 
moths. 

Soak rags in it, and then place near the holes of mice. 
Renew the oil from time to time. It effectually drives 
them away. 

Add a few drops to starch to prevent the iron sticking. 

For a paint mark on cloth that will not wash, put 
turpentine on with a small brush. Begin on the outside of 
the stain and work to the middle, in order to prevent it 
spreading. 

Turpentine mixed with beeswax makes a well known 
polish for floors. A cloth wrung out of turpentine briglitens 
up an oil cloth. 

Two parts of sweet oil and one of turpentine make a 
reliable furniture polish. It instantly removes finger marks. 

But do not forget that turpentine is highly inflammable, 
and that it should never be exposed to a flame of gas or fire.

ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 



APRICOT EGGS. 

One sponge cake (one baked in a round tin), cut it into 
slices one-half an inch thick with a round cutter about 
the size of a tumbler. Spread over each round a little 
apricot jam, and cover with whipped cream slightly flavored 
with either lemon or vanilla. In the center place Jialf an 
apricot, a canned one is the better, dust it with powdered 
sugar. The eggs are easily and quickly made ; they are 
prettv and good for a simple dessert. 

APRICOT MUSCOVITE. 

One pound of apricot jam, rub through a sieve, and, if 
not sweet enough, add some fine sugar. Make a custard 
with one scant pint of milk and the yolks of four eggs. 
When the custard is thick, let it cool and then add to it 
one-half an ounce of gelatine which has been dissolved in 
a little hot water, strained and cooled. Whip all well 
together, and as soon as the mixture begins to become firm 
add one-half a pint of stiffly whipped cream, one wine glass 
of either noyeau or apricot brandy. Pack into a mold and 
place in a pail, surrounded with broken ice and salt; let it 
remain in this for at least two hours. Any good fruit jam 
can be used in the place of apricot. 

ARTICHOKES CREAMED. 

Boil two pounds of Jerusalem artichokes in milk until 
soft enough to mash through a sieve. To the milk in which 
they were boiled, add enough more, one-half pint, add the 
yolks of four eggs slightl}' beaten, one saltspoonful of salt, 
one-half saltspoonful of pepper, and cook until thick, then 
add the artichokes and the white of one egg beaten very 
stift". Put the mixture into a well buttered mold and steam 



ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 32 I 

for one hour, covering the mold on top with a white paper 
well buttered, then let it become very cold in the refrigera- 
tor. When required, turn from the mold and serve with a 
mayonnaise. 

CUSTARD SOUFFLE. 

Two scant tablespoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls 
flour, beat these well together until light and smooth, then 
pour gradually over one cup of boiling milk, and cook all 
for eight minutes, stirring constantly. Beat together the 
yolks of four eggs and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, add to 
the cooked mixture and put away to cool. When cold, add 
the whites of the eggs beaten until stiff; put all into a 
buttered baking dish and bake for twenty minutes in a 
moderate oven. 

SUMMER SQLTASH-FRIED. 

Cut the squash into slices one-fourth of an inch in 
thickness, dip these into flour well seasoned with salt and 
pepper, fry in hot butter or good fresh beef dripping until 
brown. 

FONTAINBLEU CHEESE. 

One quart of fresh milk, stir into it one teaspoonful of 
liquid rennet (the milk must be made just blood warm), 
only stir slightly. As soon as the milk is thick, stir to sep- 
arate the curd from the whey, then drain and add two 
tablespoonsful of cream. Line some small wooden molds 
which have perforated bottoms, with cheese cloth ; place in 
these the cheese ; let it drain for two or three days, then 
remo^'e from molds and serve with salt or sugar and cream. 

GREEN PEPPERS AND CHICKEN. 

Boil two green peppers for ten minutes, cut off the tops, 
remove the seeds, and chop very fine. Mix the minced pep- 
pers with two cupsful of finely chopped cold chicken, 
three tablespoonsful of butter, three tablespoonsful of flour, 
one and one-half cupsful of chicken broth. Mix well to- 
gether, add a little salt, cook until very hot and serve on 
toast. 



32 2 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

DUCHESS PUDDING. 

Eight tablespoonsful of bread crumbs, pour over these 
one-half pint of boiling milk ; cover, and when cold, add 
six tablespoonsful of crushed macaroons, eight tablespoons- 
ful of finely chopped suet, one-half teaspoonful of salt, the 
rind of one lemon grated, six tablespoonsful of sugar, three 
eggs, beaten together; mix well and put into a buttered 
dish and bake for two hours in a moderate oven. 

JAVELLE WATER. 

One pound of sal soda, one quart of water, boil together 
until the soda is all dissolved. While this is being done, put 
one quarter of a pound of chloride of lime into one quart of 
water; let it settle, pour off all the clear liquid and add it 
to the liquid soda ; bottle and keep for removing stains from 
linen. 

JUGGED CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken, which may be an old fat one or a 
young one, into pieces the same as for fried chicken ; for 
every pound of chicken take one tablespoonful of fiour, 
which season well with salt and pepper ; roll each piece of 
chicken in this flour, then pack the chicken closely into an 
earthenware crock and cover with cold water; cover the 
crock and bake for two hours, if a young chicken is used; 
three, if an old one, in a moderate but steady oven ; the 
chicken requires no stirring.

"N THIS BOOK have been gathered a number 
of recipes: some of which are original, the re- 
sult of years of house-keeping experience; many 
old and rare ones are from friends; others have been 
translated from foreign cook books. It is hoped 
that they may prove acceptable and be useful to 
W many. 

Special attention is asked for the chapter on 
Food for Invalids, as this contains the results of 
considerable research, consultation with competent 
authorities and not a little personal experience. 
To all who have so generously and kindly 
^ given me their valuable recipes, many of them 

treasures heretofore carefully guarded as family 
secrets, I tender my sincere and appreciative 

thanks.

SOUPS. 

(GENERAL COMJvIENT.) 

So much has been written on the subject of soups and 
of their importance or non-importance, that it is not pro- 
posed to discuss these points here. Soup is intended to f re- 
fare for a dinner, therefore, the rich, thick soups, which 
are really a meal in themselves, should be omitted when a 
dinner of several courses is to follow. 

Light, nutritious soups and broths should, however, 
find a frequent place on every table. 

Stock being the basis of all meat soups and sauces, it is 
essential that we should have a proper knowledge of the 
most complete and economical method of" extracting from a 
certain quantity of meat the very best possible stock or broth . 

Meat is composed of fibres, fat, gelatine, osmazomeand 
albumen. The fibres are inseparable and constitute the 
remains of the meat after long cooking. Fat is dissolved by 
boiling ; gelatine is dissolved and is the basis and most nu- 
tritious portion of the stock ; when it is abundant, the stock 
when cold becomes a jelly. Osmazome is that part of the 
meat which gives flavor and perfume to the stock. When 
meat is roasted the osmazome appears to have a higher per- 
fume, and so when you use the remains of roast meat in 
your soup you have always a finer flavor. Albumen is of 
the nature of the white of eggs. 

Bones ought always to form a large part of the stock. 
They contain gelatine and a fat-like marrow, and by always 
breaking the bones in pieces you obtain better results. 

Beef makes the best stock. Unless fowls are old and 
fat they give but little flavor to soup. Old pigeons make 
an excellent stock. The best stock is obtained from the 
freshest meat. When the meat boiled in the stock-pot is to 
be used as a meat course at dinner or for other meals it is 
best to have it in one piece. The stock-pot should always be 



2 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

kept covered, and the contents should gently simmer, the 
vegetables being removed when tender. The contents of 
the stock-pot should be carefully skimmed and strained, and 
above all, the stock-pot should be absolutely clean. 

ARTICHOKE (JERUSALEM) SOUP. 

Two slices of ham , one-half a head of celery, one turnip, 
one onion, two tablespoonfuls of butter, four pounds of 
artichokes, one pint of bojling milk or one-half cream and 
and one-half milk, one teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, 
two lumps of sugar, three pints of white stock. Cut the 
vegetables and ham into pieces and fry in the soup kettle 
with the butter. Cook these for fifteen minutes, stirring 
them well all the time. Wash and pare the artichokes, cut 
them in pieces and add them with one-half of the stock to 
the other ingredients ; when the vegetables are all tender 
put in the rest of the stock ; stir well, add the seasoning and 
when it has cooked ten minutes mash through a sieve ; now 
return to the kettle and stir in the boiling milk or cream. 
Serve with small pieces of bread fried in butter. 

BOUILLON. 

Four pounds of lean beef, three carrots, three leeks, one 
turnip, one head of celery, one bunch of parsley, one bay 
leaf, one onion with four cloves stuck in it, one garlic clove. 
Cut the beef in pieces, put into six quarts of cold water, 
two tablespoonfuls of salt ; put on to boil, then skim off the 
froth, then let it simmer slowly for an hour ; skim all the 
fat off, then add the vegetables not cut in pieces, boil for 
three and one-half hours ; remove the vegetables and meat, 
strain the soup ; when cold take off all the fat and heat the 
soup, strain through a napkin. The fat is excellent for 
frying purposes. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Three pounds of beef, one pound of bone — the shin of 
beef is very good for soup, provided there is enough meat 
on it ; have the bones all cracked. Five quarts of cold 
water, one teaspoonful of salt, two carrots, two onions, in 
which stick two cloves, six leeks, one head of celery, one 
umip. Put on the fire in the soup pot the cold water and

the meat and bone ; when the soup boils add one-half tea- 
cup of cold water ; this will accelerate the rising of the 
scum ; skim, repeat this three times, the broth ought then 
to look clear, then add the vegetables ; as soon after as the 
soup boils put it on the corner of the stove and let it simmer 
there for four or five hours ; when the vegetables are done 
remove them from the soup. It may be necessary to add a 
little more salt when the soup is served. 

BEEF STOCK. 

One shin of beef cut in pieces, bones and meat ; six 
quarts of water. Fry together one quart of onions and 
three carrots until they are brown, then put them into the 
soup pot and one bunch of parsley, one head of celery, four 
bay leaves, six cloves. Let the soup boil gently at least six 
hours, then strain ; the next day remove all the fat, and 
when the soup is needed heat it, adding vermicelli, barley 
or rice to it ; if vermiceli, soak it in warm water for a few 
minutes ; if barley, it must be cooked slowly for several 
hours in water ; rice must be cooked in boiling water ; Ital- 
ian paste does not need cooking; put it in the soup when 
served. 

BAKED BEAN SOUP. 

It is always good economy to make a much larger dish 
of baked beans than will be used at one time. Reserve a 
portion of them for to-morrow's salad and put the rest over 
the fire with a quart of water and soup vegetables and 
herbs ; simmer an hour and press through a sieve ; return 
to the fire, stir in a teaspoonful of flour, wet with milk to 
prevent settling, and dilute the soup to the proper consis- 
tency with hot milk. 

BLACK BEAN SOUP. 

One pint of black beans, soak them over night in three 
quarts of water ; boil them three hours with any bones or 
meat you have, or with one pound of lean beef and a slice 
of salt pork ; two onions sliced ; when the beans are very 
soft rub the soup through a sieve, add a little spice and 
cloves, if liked. Cut up one lemon into thin slices and put 
in tureen with three hard-boiled eggs sliced and one gill of

port or sherry ; this addition is not necessary; strain the 
soup into the tureen, stirring well. 

BREAD PANADA SOUP. 

Three pints of water, add three tablespoonfuls of bread 
broken in small pieces, one saltspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful of butter. Put these on a very hot fire and stir 
constantly for twenty minutes. 

Mix together the yolks of four eggs with one teacup 
of .cream or milk, one tablespoonful of butter ; put the 
boiling soup into the tureen and stir in the yolks, etc., stir- 
ring all the time, and serve at once. 

BAKED SOUP. 

Two pounds of any kind of meat trimmings or odd 
pieces, two onions, two carrots, two ounces of rice, one 
pint of split peas, four quarts of cold water, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a little pepper. Cut the meat and vegetables in 
pieces, add the rice and peas, season with the salt and pep- 
per ; put all into a jar, fill in with the water, cover closely 
and bake for four hours, then strain and serve. 

This soup is very good and wholesome, and can be 
made in the oven when the top of the stove is occupied. 

BISQUE OF CLAMS. 

Take thirty clams, boil them in their own juice for five 
minutes, drain and chop them very fine. Put into the 
saucepan four ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, one- 
half saltspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, a 
little cayenne, one pint of milk ; stir constantly, and just 
before the mixture boils move from the fire, strain and heat 
again ; the butter and flour must be quite smoothly blended 
before the milk and other ingredients are added. 

A QUICK BROTH. 

One pound of lean beef cut in fine pieces and some 
chicken bones well broken up ; add one quart of cold water, 
one carrot, one onion, a little celery and one saltspoonful of 
salt. Boil gently together for one hour, strain and serve

joram, one carrot, one turnip, one large onion, two stalks 
of celery, all cut fine ; one tablespoonful of salt. Wipe the 
meat with a clean, damp cloth— never wash meat for soup ; 
cut the meat into small pieces, break up the bones ; fry one- 
third of the meat with the marrow from the bones ; put the 
rest of the meat with the bones into the soup kettle, add 
the water, let it stand one-half hour, then add the fried 
meat and cook all slowly, never boiling, only simmering,

in a stew-pan and add one quart of cold water with one table- 
spoonful of cut leeks or one small onion, twenty blanched 
and peeled almonds, one blade of mace, and a saltspoonful 
of salt. Stir the broth until it boils, then skim carefully ; 
after that remove from the hot fire to the cooler part of the 
stove and let the broth simmer for two hours, strain the 
broth and put away to cool, unless it is desired at once. 
Serve with slices of hot toast. 

CELERY SOUP. 

Take one quart of good stock either made from veal or 
the water in which chickens have been boiled ; put on the 
fire one-half cupful of rice and one pint of milk and grate

yolks of eggs, and one whole egg, a little pepper and salt, 
one-fourth of a pint of milk, one-fourth pint of the con- 
somme, mix well together. Butter a small cup or mold, fill 
with the custard, bake slowly for a few minutes or until the 
custard is solid ; when cold, cut into small dice and serve in 
the soup.

half pound of butter, when hot, fry the carrots, four leeks 
cut fine, one onion sliced, together for five minutes, then

any soup, you desire to darken in color. 

COLORING FOR SOUPS— 2. 

Take onions and cut them in slices and put them into 
a moderate oven, leave until they are black chips (not 
burnt). These may be bottled and are by some considered 
far better for coloring soups and gravies than burnt sugar.

FISH CHOWDER. 

Put half a pound of sliced salt pork in the bottom of a 
saucepan and fry brown ; take it out, and put in layers of 
potatoes, onions and fish sliced, seasoning each layer with 
plenty of salt and pepper, using about three pounds of fish, 
and a quart each of potatoes and onions, cover with cold 
water, bring gradually to a boil, and cook slowly for thirty 
minutes ; then add two pounds of sea-biscuit soaked for 
five minutes in warm water, and boil five minutes longer 
and serve. 

FISH SOUP. 

Put into the frying-pan one-half pound of butter, four 
carrots cut fine, three onions sliced, two heads of celery cut 
fine, two shallots cut fine or one clove of garlic, three 
cloves, one bay leaf, one little bunch of thyme and parsley ; 
fry all these until they are brown ; then add one pint of 
white wine and three quarts of boiling water, one teas- 
spoonful of salt, and one saltspoonful of pepper; put witli 
these six pounds of any good fish, let all simmer for two 
hours ; when finished, strain through a cloth ; serve hot. 

MARYLAND CHOWDER. 

There is nothing better for a chowder than a large cod 
or haddock. Two pounds of fish, one-half pound of water 
crackers, two ounces of butter, one pint of oysters or clams, 
one gill of cream, one gill of water, one onion sliced, one 
tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one- 
half teaspoonful of mace, one-third teaspoonful of cayenne. 
Put the water into the soup kettle, then the onion, one- 
half the fish, the skin side down ; sprinkle in one-half the 
salt and pepper, etc., then one half of the oysters or clams, 
cover all with the butter in small lumps and one-half of the 
crackers ; the rest of the fish, oysters, seasoning, butter and 
crackers ; pour over the cream having first boiled it. If 
the oysters have much liquor, you do not need the water ; if 
the chowder is too dry add a little more water, cover closely 
and cook one-half hour, serve on a platter ; milk may be 
used instead of cream. One-half pound of bacon or salt 
pork gives a good flavor. To be eaten on plates with a 
fork, not as a soup. 



SOUPS. 



FLEMISH SOUP. 



One dozen sliced potatoes, two heads of celery, two 
onions, four pounds of shin of beef, four quarts of water, 
salt, pepper ; boil together three hours, then add one-half 
pint of boiling milk or hot cream and one teaspoonful of 
sugar. 

GLAZE. 

This is one of the most valuable aids to good cooking- 
it will keep for years. It is not always possible to have 
stock in the house at all times, especially in summer — with 
glaze one does not need to have it. 

Take six pounds of lean beef, the leg is the best ; part 
of a knuckle of veal, with the beef to weigh six pounds ; 
cut all into small pieces with one-half a pound of lean ham ; 
do not let any of the outside of the ham go in the pot. Put 
these into the soup with five quarts of water, three onions 
with two cloves stuck in each, one carrot and one head of 
celery; let all come to the boiling point, then skim, then 
place on the back of the range and let it simmer for six 
hours — it is now an excellent foundation for clear soups or 
gravies by adding one teaspoonful of salt, but do not add 
any salt, if it is intended to reduce to glaze ; just strain the 
stock through the colander, place in an earthern crock, 
put back the meat and vegetables with four quarts of boil- 
ing water and boil all four hours longer, then strain and 
place in another crock or bowl ; next morning, take the two 
stocks, heat them and strain again, then unite them in one 
large pot and let it boil as fast as possible, be sure not to 
cover it ; when it is reduced to three pints, then put it into 
a smaller pot and boil until it is thick and of a brown color ; 
be very watchful that it does not burn, as this is the 
dangerous time. When you have only a little over a pint, 
pour it into small jars or into sausage skins which have 
been well cleansed, or it can be poured on to tins and dried 
by exposure until it is dry; if put into jars do not cover 
them until the glaze leaves the sides of the jar. To put the 
glaze into the sausage skins, tie one end very tight and pour 
the glaze through a funnel, into the skin, tie up the other end 
and hang it to dry; when the glaze is needed cut a slice off 
this.

which has been cut into pieces. Fry these brown, and then 
put them into the soup kettle with one pint of tomatoes, one 
pint of okra sliced, one onion sliced, one saltspoonful of salt 
and two quarts of cold water ; cook together for four hours 
very slowly — the soup must not boil, only simmer — when de-

in small pieces. Let the soup boil, skim and place on the 
back of the stove to simmer for three hours, then strain 
and remove the fat. Boil two tablespoonfuls of barley

three hard-boiled eggs moistened with one tablespoonful of 
cream, and then stir it into the soup, slowly ; put in the bal- 
ance of the barley and serve. 

CALF'S HEAD OR MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

Take the water in which the head was boiled, two pounds 
of veal, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of chopped carrots, 
one turnip cut fine, three stalks of celery, one blade of mace, 
four cloves, twenty pepper-corns, one bay leaf, a little pars- 
ley. Put all the vegetables into a pan and fry them with 
two tablespoonfuls of butter until they are brown ; put them 
with the stock and veal ; cook slowly for one hour, strain 
the soup, return to the kettle, and add two lemons cut in 
slices, one glass of sherry or port, some salt and pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed to a soft paste with a 
little water, one tablespoonful of tomato catsup, some egg 
and force-meat balls. Serve. 

Any of the soup left is equally good re-heated the next 
day.

Take the neck of mutton, cut it in pieces, add to it three 
carrots, two turnips, two onions, all sliced, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, one tablespoonful of parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, 
a little pepper and three pints of cold water ; simmer slowly 
for four or five hours, then skim ; pass the soup through the 
sieve and return to the soup kettle to boil just once. Serve

has been cooking. 

MINESTRONE. 

A FAVORITE ITALIAN THICK SOUP. 

Three quarts of boiling water well salted, one piece of 
salt pork the size of an egg ; one large clove of garlic ; chop 
the garlic fine with the pork ; this is absolutely essential ; 
one handful of lima beans, one-half a carrot, one-half a 
small turnip, both chopped fine ; add these to the water and 
boil for twenty minutes, then add tw^o large tomatoes 
(stewed and strained), two potatoes chopped fine, one ear 
of corn, the kernels cut off ; one-half a medium sized cab- 
bage — use pieces of the leaves as large as your hand, but 
remove the thick stem, one-half a pint of rice ; boil slowly, 
covered, one-half an hour or until the rice and cabbage are 
done, no longer, as the cabbage becomes watery if cooked 
too much. 

NORMANDY SOUP. 

One knuckle of veal, one quart of white button onions, 
four quarts of cold water, half a loaf of bread, one quart of 
cream, two tablespoonfuls of butter, salt and pepper to 
taste, two tablespoonfuls of flour. Put veal in the soup 
kettle with onions and water, let all simmer slowly for two 
hours ; then add the bread cut in slices. Simmer slowly for 
two hours more. Remove the knuckle and press the ingre- 
dients through a sieve. Rub butter and flour together to a 
smooth paste, stir into the boiling soup, and stir constantly 
until it thickens. Add the cream, salt and pepper, and 
serve. 



12 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

ONION SOUP. 

Fry six large onions in some butter or good dripping un- 
til they are brown, then stir in with the onions one table- 
spoonful of flour, then add one quart of hot water ; stew the 
onions till tender; add one teaspoonful of salt and one tea- 
spoonful of sugar ; when the onions are done, strain the soup

the soup tureen two slices of hot toast before pouring in the 
soup. 

BAKED ONION SOUP. 

Place in a dish which will stand the heat, some slices of 
bread with the crusts left on. Fry three onions in a pan 
with one tablespoonful of butter until brown, put these on 
the bread, and then fill up the dish with some good con- 
somme or stock ; sprinkle on the top some grated cheese, 
cover the dish and let the soup bake in the oven for ten 
minutes; the soup is really better served in the same dish. 
If this is not liked, be sure the tureen is hot before the soup 
is poured into it, aud that it is served at once. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

Two ox tails, two slices of ham, one tablespoonful of 
butter, two carrots, three onions, one leek, one head of 
celery, one bunch of sweet herbs, one bay leaf, twelve 
pepper-corns, four cloves, one teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one glass of port wine, 
three quarts of water. Cut up the tails, wash them well in 
cold water, put them in the soup kettle with the butter ; cut 
the vegetables in slices, add them with the herbs and pepper- 
corns, add one-half pint of water ; stir and cook these well 
together for ten minutes, then fill up the stew-pan with the 
water, and when boiling, skim well and add the salt; sim- 
mer gently for four hours or until the ox tails are tender, 
then take them out of the soup, strain it, thicken with a 
little flour, add the wine and catsup, put back the tails, sim- 
mer for ten minutes and serve. 

A dish of boiled rice, boiled dry, is very nice to serve 
with the soup,

oysters ; cook the oysters in their own liquor until they are 
plump, add the potatoes, cracker crumbs, and last of all the

bread crumbs, one-half pint of cream, one lump of sugar, 
two quarts of good veal stock. Boil the chicken until it is 
tender, then remove from the soup kettle, pull off the meat

when smooth, return to the soup kettle with the bread 
crumbs and let all simmer for one hour, then rub through 
the sieve, add the sugar, a little salt, and the cream ; take 
the crust of the loaf and place in the tureen ; pour over the 
soup. 

CREAM OF SPINACH. 

Wash and pick the spinach and put it on to boil ; boil 
until soft and tender, then press enough through a sieve to 
make a generous pint of the pulp, add to this one quart of 
rich chicken or any good, white stock ; when it becomes 
very hot, take one tablespoonful of butter and two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch and rub together until smooth, 
stir this into the soup and continue to stir until very smooth. 
Season with salt and white pepper ; return to the soup pot 
and add a cup of cream, beat all the time after the cream is 
added with an egg-whip^this you will find makes it very 
light. Serve immediately ; it should be very hot. 

Cream of Asparagus, Cream of Celery, Cream of Beets, 
Cream of Corn, Cream of Lettuce, and Cream of Green Peas 
are all made in the same manner.

bunch of parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper. 
Cook the vegetables in the stock until tender, and then 
serve all together. The stock can be omitted and water 
substituted. Vegetable soups, clear and thick, are extremely 
palatable ; the former being agreeable and wholesome, 
especially in warm weather, when fresh vegetables are 
abundant and full of juice and fragrance, and the latter, or 
thick soup may be very nutritious also. Nutritious and 
palatable soup may be made from fish of the cheaf)er sorts, 
using fish in place of meat for the stock. 

VEAL OR MUTTON BROTH. 
To each pound of meat and bones add one pint of cold

ham, three carrots, two onions, one head of celery, twelve 
pepper-corns, one teaspoonful of salt, one blade of mace, 
one bunch of sweet herbs, four quarts of water, one table- 
spoonful of butter. Cut the veal, put it and the trimmings 
of poultry and the ham into the soup kettle with the butter, 
moisten with one-half pint of water and simmer until the 
gravy flows, then add the four quarts of water and the re- 
mainder of the ingredients ; simmer slowly for five hours, 
skim, and then strain through a fine sieve, and it is ready 
for use. 



FISH, 17 



FISH. 

Fish is better fried than boiled ; water extracts the 
juices and flavor ; always use a deep vessel with plenty of 
fat for frying. 

Roasted or baked fish are always good, and Sir Henry 
Thompson advises that fish be so prepared. He says : 
" Even a coarse kind of fish if baked with a few slices of 
bacon will yield a good nutritious meal, which will cost 
only one-third of an average meat meal." 

To bake, place the fish in a tin vessel only slightly 
deeper than its own thickness, with a lid to prevent the 
escape of the flavor ; the dish to be well buttered, placed in 
a closed oven and the fish served in the original dish if 
possible. 

FISH BOILED IN COURT BOUILLON. 

Put on the bottom of your fish kettle a bed made of 
sliced carrots, onions, one lemon, some parsley, thyme, bay 
leaf and one tablespoonful of whole pepper grains. On this 
bed place the fish and cover with half w^hite wine and half 
cold water, or water with three wine glasses of good vine- 
gar. Have a moderate fire and as soon as the liquid boils, 
take off the kettle and remove the fish. Serve with a white 
sauce. The bouillon can be strained and kept for several 
days and used several times, but be sure to re-boil it every 
three days. 

BOILING FISH. 

In boiling delicate fish, such as salmon cod or halibut, 
the plunging into boiling water tends to break the fish ; it 
should be put first into water that is on the point of boil- 
ing, kept at this temperature for a few minutes and then 
allowed to fall several degrees and cooked at about 180 
degrees F. The fish will be delicate and have preserved its 
form. 



l8 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

FISH CREAMED. 

Boil a white fish, about three pounds for fifteen min- 
utes, then take from the water and let it cool ; when cool, 
mince it very fine after having carefully removed all the 
bones ; butter a baking dish. Boil one pint of milk ; stir 
together three tablespoonfuls of flour, and two.tablespoon- 
fuls of butter ; when smooth stir into the hot milk with 
three sprigs of parsley, two onions minced fine, and the 
yolk of one egg beaten light. Place a layer of the fish in 
the dish, then a layer of the sauce and so on until the dish 
is full. Spread a thin layer of bread crumbs, which have 
been lightly buttered, over the top, and bake for one-half 
hour. 

FRIED SMALL FISH. 

Do not split the fish ; clean them, dip them in beaten 
egg and bread crumbs, or in flour seasoned with salt and 
pepper ; have some fat hot in the pan, put in the fish, cook 
them for ten minutes, turn and brown on the other side, and 
serve. For the fat take some slices of salt pork and fry in 
the pan ; when all the fat is out remove the pork and fry 
the fish in the fat remaining. Serve on hot dish. 

FRIED PERCH, SMELT, PORGY OR ANY SMALL 

FISH. 
After each fish is cleaned, put into it a thin slice of fat 
salt pork, three slices of onion and a little green pepper, or 
red pepper, -wiith the seeds removed ; add a sprig of mint if 
obtainable ; tie up the fish or skewer it, bread it and dip in 
beaten egg and fry. The heat drives the flavoring into the 
fish. This is a Cuban recipe. 

FISH CHOPS. 

These can be made with salmon or any other fish. 

Take one-half pound of cooked fish, carefully remove 
all the bones and particles of skin, shred very fine ; add to 
the fish two teaspoonfuls of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
pepper, one-half teaspoonful of cayenne and one teaspoonful 
of onion juice. Boil one cup of milk'; when boiling, stir 
into it three tablespoonfuls of flour, well mixed, with one 
tablespoonful of butter ; when thick remove from the fire 
and add the yolks of three eggs ; stir them well into the 



FISH. 19 

milk, add the fish, place on the fire again for two minutes, 
then add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley and one tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Spread the mixture on a platter 
and let it rest on the ice for several hours to become stiff ; 
when required take one tablespoonful of the mixture, form 
into a chop, and make all of the mixture into chops ; roll 
each one in beaten egg, then into fine crumbs and fry in 
deep hot fat for two minutes ; serve with a Tomato or Hol- 
landaise sance. 

FISH PIE. 
Four pounds of haddock or bass, boil with plenty of 
salt in the water ; take off the skin and bones, then flake 
the fish. Boil one quart of cream or milk, add one table- 
spoonful of flour stirred into cream until perfectly smooth, 
add one tablespoonful of parsley and one-half an onion 
chopped fine, also one-fourth pound of butter ; after all is 
boiled add a little cayenne ; grease a pan, put in it layers of 
fish, then sauce ; let the last layer be of the sauce ; strew on 
the top a thin layer of bread crumbs ; bake one-half hour. 

FISH PUDDING. 

Cold boiled fish makes an excellent pudding ; salmon is 
particularly good. To one pint of fish add two well beaten 
eggs, three tablespoonfuls of cream, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, a little salt and paprika. Mix them well 
together, breaking the fish into medium-sized pieces. Turn 
the iriixture into a bowl that has been well buttered and 
sprinkled with crumbs. Place the bowl in a pan of hot 
water and put into a hot oven. Bake twenty minutes and 
turn out on a heated dish, and have a cream sauce to pour 
around it. 

TIMBALES OF FISH. 

To every half pound of fresh fish add one cup of bread 
crumbs, and one-half cupful of sweet milk ; boil the crumbs 
and milk together, pound the fish to a smooth paste, gradually 
adding the crumbs and milk, then add one-half teaspoonful 
of salt, a little cayenne, three drops of onion juice ; when 
all the mixture is smooth fold in quickly the beaten whites 
of five eggs. Have the timbale tins greased, pour in the 
mixture, cover them with white paper and steam for twenty 
minutes ; serve with a white sauce.

An excellent breakfast dish is clam fritters. Chop fine 
two dozen clams, make a batter with one pint of flour, in 
which has been sifted a level teaspoonful of baking powder ; 
add a cup of sweet milk and nearly as much of the clam 
liquor, and two eggs beaten light ; beat hard until it is a 
smooth batter, then stir in the chopped clams ; put plenty 
of lard in the frying pan and let it become boiling hot ; put

minutes ; put a little melted butter on the lobster to keep it 
from drying. When cooked serve with butter, salt and 
pepper, or with a sauce. 

LOBSTER— TO BAKE. 
Cut the lobster in the same manner as for broiling, 
remove the stomach and intestine, place in a baking pan, 
with a little butter spread over ; when about half cooked

rooms and some fresh, green peppers chopped fine and the 
seeds removed — the sauce must be of the consistency of 
thick cream. Have the meat of the lobster cut into pieces, 
cook it in the sauce long enough to become very hot, or a 
better plan is to warm it in a little of the stock before it is 
thickened, then add the balance of the stock. 

DEVILED LOBSTER. 

One lobster, take out the meat and cut into fine pieces ; 
put into stew pan one tablespoonful of butter, one table-

BOILED SALMON. 

To cook salmon in perfection a slice should be plunged 
into boiling water enough to well cover it and allowed to 
boil eight minutes. Serve with drawn butter sauce. 

BROILED SALMON. 

Take a slice of salmon weighing two or three pounds, 
have the gridiron hot and greased, place the salmon on it, 
turn often to prevent burning. Cook ten minutes, butter

butter, one tablespoonful of flour, one tablespoonful of 
mustard, one-half teaspoonful of cayenne, one pint of milk. 
Put the butter into the sauce pan, when it bubbles add the 
flour, mix well together, then add the milk ; when the mix- 
ture is smooth and creamy, add the mustard which must be 
made into a soft paste before adding, and the cayenne. Put 
the salmon into a pudding dish, pour over the mixture, and 
on top of this spread a thin layer of bread crumbs and a few 
bits of butter. Bake ten minutes in a hot oven. 

SOUCED SALMON.

COOK BOOK. 



CROQUETTES OF SHAD-ROES. 

Two shad-roes, put them into a sauce pan with boiling 
water slightly salted, let them cook slowly for fifteen 
minutes, then take from the fire, pull off the fine skin and 
mash them. Put one tablespoonful of butter into the sauce

When cold flour your hands and make the mixture into 
croquettes. Have one egg beaten, dip the croquettes into 
the egg first, then roll in fine bread crumbs, then in the egg 
again. Let them stand in the ice-box for fully an hour 
before frying, then have your fat very hot (see general 
directions for frying), when they are a golden brown color, 
drain them on folded brown paper. Serve with slices of 
lemon and a Tartar Sauce. 

PLANKED SHAD. 

The famous Planked Shad of the Delaware River are 
usually split down the back ; when the fish is split, proceed 
as for planked White Fish. 

FRIED SCALLOPS 

Wash the scallops, drain them well, then dip them into 
fine cracker crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper, then 
into an egg beaten and again into the crumbs ; fry in smok- 
ing hot fat. A Mayonaise dressing is delicious with fried 
scallops. 

SCALLOPS POULET AU CREME. 

Two tablespoonfuls of milk flavored with a little onion 
water or juice. Into this put one quart of scallops, chopped 
fine and the breast of one small boiled chicken, cut fine.

in beaten eggs, then in bread crumbs ; fry in hot, deep fat. 
Serve them crisp and dry with Tartar Sauce. 

CREAM SALMON OR TROUT. 

Have the head and tail cut off, put the fish into boiling 
water which has been slightly salted and simmer for five 
minutes, then remove from the fire and drain. Put the fish 
into a stew pan with a little mace, nutmeg, cayenne, all 
mixed together ; then cover the fish with cream, adding bits 
of butter. Keep the pan covered and let the fish stew for 
ten minutes, then dish the fish ; keep it hot while you make 
the sauce. Take one dessert-spoonful of flour mixed smooth 
with milk ; stir this into the cream, add the juice of one 
lemon, let this just boil, then strain, and pour over the fish. 

TO FRY BROOK TROUT OR ANY OTHER SMALL 

FISH. 

Clean the fish and let them lie for a few minutes on a 
clean towel ; season some cornmeal with salt and pepper, 
roll the fish in this and fry them in two-thirds butter and 
one-third lard ; drain on a sieve or on coarse brown paper 
and serve quickly. 

BAKED WHITE FISH. 

Bone the fish and cut into small squares or rounds, 
place them in a deep plate and put bits of butter over, 
some green ""peppers chopped fine and a little salt ; pour 
over some whit^ wine, cover the dish closely and bake the 
fish for one-half hour ; serve with the following sauce : 

Cook one tablespoonful of butter until it is a delicate 
brown, put in one teaspoonful of capers, and one teaspoon- 
ful of flour ; either add a little more wine or drain the sauce

minutes ; serve on hot platter, with melted butter over and 
some chopped parsley, a little salt and pepper ; garnish with 
slices of lemon. 

WHITE FISH BAKED WITH OYSTERS. 

One white fish, weighing about five pounds ; do not 
split, wipe dry on the inside and outside and rub well with 
a mixture of salt, pepper and flour, prepare the oysters 
for stuffing the fish. Take one full pint of oysters, drain 
them and roll each oyster in well seasoned bread crumbs, 
fill the fish, put slices of salt pork over the fish and bake for 
twenty minutes or until the fish is well browned ; baste fre- 
quently with the water which comes from the fish; serve 
with a tomato sauce. 

PLANKED WHITE FISH. 

Cut the fish on the underside, bone it, wash and wipe 
dry ; remove the line of opaque-looking fat on each edge. 
One hour before cooking rub the fish with a little olive oil 
and sprinkle over with one teaspoonful of brown sugar to 
which has been added a little cayenne and one saltspoonful 
of salt. 

The plank should be made of some hard wood and 
always heated before the fish is placed upon it : while the 
fish is cooking it should be well basted with melted butter; 
cook for a half hour ; when cooked serve wth a garnish of 
slices of lemon and cucumber. 

STEWED TERRAPIN. 
(Washington). • 

Put the terrapin into boiling water and then simmer 
them until the feet are tender to the touch. Remove from 
the water, clean and pick them from the shells, cut into 
pieces ready for the dressing. To prepare the dressing take 
one pound of butter to three terrapins, melt the butter; when 
hot add the terrapins with one saltspoon of pepper, but no 
salt. Take for each terrapin the yolks of three hard boiled 
eggs, mash the yolks perfectly smooth and add one wine 
glass of Madeira wine, a little at a time, until the yolks are 
reduced to a thin paste ; it may be necessary to add more 
wine, add one-half a nutmeg grated ; place the paste over 



FISH. 3g 

the terrapins (it should just cover them) and make very hot. 
The greatest care should be taken not to break the gall 
bladder, as the whole dish will be spoiled if even a drop of 
the -gall should touch it. 

TO FRESHEN COD FISH. 
Cover the piece with cold water and let it heat gradu- 
ally ; when it boils the fish will part easily from the bones, 
remove from the stove ; when cool pick it fine. 

COD FISH BALLS. 
Cut the fish in pieces and soak an hour in luke warm 
water, then you can remove the skin and bones easily ; then 
put on the stove in cold water and when it begins to boil 
change the water and repeat twice ; this removes the salt 
sufficiently ; then let it cook slowly until very tender. As 
soon as the fish is ready, the potatoes (which must be cooked 
at the same time), must be well mashed and added to the 
fish while hot, with a piece of butter the size of an egg, and 
one egg. You must have twice as much potatoes as fish, 
one cup offish, two of potatoes. Mix well together, mois- 
ten with milk until of the consistency,, that will hold to- 
gether, then mold into balls and fry in boiling lard, or if 
you prefer you can fry out slices of salt pork and cook the 
fish balls in it — either is good. 

COD FISH CAKES. 
Wash and boil one quart of potatoes, putting them on 
the fire in cold water enough to cover them, and a table- 
spoonful of salt. Put one and a half pounds of salt cod 
fish on the fire in plenty of cold water and bring it slowly 
to a boil ; as soon as it boils throw off that water and put 
it again on the fire with fresh cold water ; if the fish is very 
salt change the vv^ater a third time. Free the fish from skin 
and bones ; peel the potatoes, mash them through a colan- 
der with a potato masher, season them with a quarter of a 
saltspoonful of pepper and an ounce of butter; add the yolks 
of two eggs and the fish ; mix well and make into cakes, 
using a little flour to prevent sticking to the hands. Fry 
them golden brown in enough smoking hot fat to nearly 
cover them ; observe that in frying any article of food it 
will not soak fat if the latter be hot enough to carbonize the 
outside at once, and smoking hot fat will do that. 



aO THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CREAMED COD FISH. 
Soak the cod fish for fifteeen hours in a large quantity 
of cold water, skin the fish, pick it all from the bones, cut 
it in small dice pieces. Take a large skillet, put the fish one 
inch deep in this, pour over cold water to cover the fish, let 
it simmer, but not boil, for two hours. About twenty min- 
utes before serving pour off the water and cover the fish 
with milk ; add one-half pound of butter to one quart of fish, 
add a little pepper, a very little salt ; let the fish boil, then 
take one tablepsoonful of flo,ur mixed smooth with a little 
water, stir it into the fish while it is boiling ; then just when 
ready to serve the fish add two eggs well beaten ; do not let 
the eggs boil. The fish can be prepared at any time, but 
must be kept covered with cold water ; do not let it stand 
after draining. 

COD FISH ON TOAST. 
(Cuban). 
One teacup of freshened cod fish shredded fine ; fry one 
onion and one tablespoonful of butter until brown, then put 
in the cod fish with enough cold water to cover it, add one- 
half can of tomatoes or six fresh tomatoes ; cook all slowly 
for one hour, add a little salt and pepper. Have ready 
slices of hot toast and pour on them the cod fish. 

SALT FISH. 
Soak the fish in cold water for two days, changing the 
water several times ; when required, dry it well ; fry in the 
pan with one tablespoonful of butter two onions sliced ; 
fry until yellow, remove the bones from the fish, season 
with pepper, one teaspoonful of mustard and one table- 
spoonful of vinegar ; mix with the onions and cook for ten 
minutes and serve very hot. Fish should always be split 
open for broiling. 

TO FRESHEN SALT FISH. 
Lay the fish in cold water with the skin side up, other- 
wise the salt sinks into the skin and the fish will not freshen. 

CROUTES OF HADDOCK. 
Take a finnan haddock about a pound in weight, free 
it from skin and bones, and put it into a stew-pan with two 



FISH. 31 

ounces of butter, four tablespoonfuls of milk, a well-beaten 
yolk of egg, a little pepper and a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice. Whisk these ingredients over the fire for five min- 
utes, by which time the fish will be smooth. Pile this on some 
small rounds of hot buttered toast. Sprinkle the tops lightly 
with some finely minced parsley and red pepper, and serve. 

FINNAN HADDlfi. 

One pound of finnan haddie, put into a pan and cover 
wth boiling water, let it boil for five minutes, drain off the

pepper and salt on the white side ; dip each one into heated 
fat and broil them over a clear fire ; when ready serve on 
toast and add one tablespoonful of lemon juice and one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Be sure to serve the 
fish very hot. 

PICKLED HERRINGS. 

Take twenty-four best fresh roe herrings, have them 
well cleaned ; place them in a large stone crock, putting 
first a layer of herrings, then cover them with salt, a few 
cloves, a little allspice, mace and whole pepper corns ; then 
another layer of herrings ; repeat this until the crock is full ; 
cover the whole with vinegar. Place on the range, and 
let all simmer, but not boil, for twelve hours, then the 
preparation is ready to use ; but it will keep for weeks if 
kept covered with -vinegar, and the crock tightly closed. 

SALT MACKEREL— TO BOIL. 

Soak the fish, skin side upward, for twenty-four hours ; 
drain, cook in boiling water for five minutes ; pour off the 
water and cover fish w^ith sweet milk ; cook for fifteen 
minutes ; remove the fish, thicken the milk with one table- 
spoonful of flour and one-half tablespoonful of butter 
rubbed together ; saltspoon of pepper ; pour this sauce over 
the fish and serve hot. 



32 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

SALT MACKEREL BROILED. 

The fish from Norway are the finest. Soak the 
mackerel for two days in cold water, change the water two 
or three times, wipe dry. Broil over a clear fire, place on 
hot dish, pour one pint of boiling water on the fish, let it 
stand for a minute, then pour it off; put on the fish a little 
butter, lemon juice and minced parsley, and serve. 

The boiling w^ater poured on and off removes all taste 
of oil from the fish. Do not drink any liquids while the 
fish is being eaten ; if this rule is observed the fish will not 
be apt to disagree with any one, or prove indigestible — and 
salt fish is really a valuable food. 

DEVILED SARDINES. 

Take six sardines and spread over them on both sides 
some made mustard and a dash of cayenne, broil them and 
serve on hot buttered toast ; garnish with slices of lemon. 

SARDINES MAITRE D'HOTEL. 
Take six sardines, a dessert-spoonful of chopped parsley, 
one thin slice of onion pounded fine, one tablespoonful of 
Chili vinegar, half a pint "of melted butter, and a round of 
toast ; scrape the sardines, arrange them neatly on the toast, 
and put the above sauce over them, adding a squeeze of 
lemon juice and cayenne to it. 

SARDINES WITH EGGS. 
Fry some bread in boiling lard or butter ; cut it into 
fingers ; scale and wipe some sardines, make them hot in the 
oven, and place one on each finger of bread; then pour 
over them the following sauce : The yolks of four eggs 
well whipped, half an ounce of butter, .one teaspoonful of 
tarragon vinegar, one teaspoonful of common vinegar, a 
mustard spoonful of made mustard and a little salt. These 
must be well stirred over the fire till the sauce thickens, but 
does not boil. 

KIPPERED SALMON. 
Rub the salmon with an equal mixture of salt and 
sugar ; let this fish stand twelve hours, then smoke it for 
twelve hours. Put the fire far away from the fish, so that 
the smoke will blow over the fish steadily. 



OYSTERS. 33 



OYSTERS. 



ANGELS ON HORSEBACK. 
Take very thin slices of fat bacon, cut all the rind off. 
Then take an oyster (or two if very small) , pour on it two 
drops of essence of anchovy, four of lemon, and a grain of 
cayenne and roll it in the slice of bacon. Tie them together. 
When there are sufficient of these rolls, put them on a small 
skewer and fry them ; when cooked take each one separately 
and place on a small piece of toast. This is a dish which 
must be served very hot. 

BROILED OYSTERS— I. 

Dry large oysters on a napkin ; roll them in fine cracker 
crumbs, then into melted butter and again into the crumbs, 
add a very little salt and pepper with the crumbs ; broil 
them on a wire gridiron well greased ; they are done as 
soon as they are a light brown. Serve with slices of lemon. 

BROILED OYSTERS— 2. 

Select large oysters, drain them, lay them on a well- 
greased broiler, place it over a clear fire and turn it as the 
oysters cook ; when done, serve at once ; pour over them 
some melted butter, seasoned with salt and pepper and some 
finely chopped parsley. 

OYSTERS IN BLANKETS. 
Take large oysters, season with cayenne, wrap up each 
one in a thin piece of bacon, fasten with a little wood tooth 
pick ; fry them for a few minutes, serve very hot. 

BAKED OYSTERS WITH SHERRY. 
Fifty oysters ; put one-third in a deep dish ; add a table- 
spoonful of melted butter and cover with bread crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper ; then put one-half of the 
remaining oysters in and proceed as above, then the balance ; 



•^4 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

pour in sherry enough to cover the oysters, add a layer of 
bread crumbs and one tablespoonful of melted butter. Bake 
until colored brown, serve hot. 

BROWNED OYSTERS ON TOAST. 

Mix yolks of two eggs with a little flour. Season 
twenty-four oysters and dip in the batter. Brown the 
oysters in hot butter. Then add the oyster liquor to the 
flour and eggs, stir into the butter, simmer three minutes, 
add oysters again, and serve on toast. 

CREAMED OYSTERS. 
Blanch twenty-five oysters and drain them ; take one 
tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour ; stir 
together in the saucepan until smooth, then add one cup of 
cream, a little salt and pepper and one-half teaspoonful of 
nutmeg; when the mixture boils, add the oysters, cook for 
five minutes. 

OYSTER CUTLETS— I. 
Mix about half a pound of veal with the same weight 
of large stewing oysters ; chop all very finely, then pound 
them together in a mortar, adding two ounces of finely- 
chopped veal suet and three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs 
which have been soaked in the liquor from the oysters; 
season with a little salt, white pepper and a teaspoonful of 
lemon juice and one tablespoonful of cream. Now^ add the 
beaten yolks of two eggs and mix thoroughly, pounding all 
a little more, and make up into the shape of small cutlets. 
Fry them in butter after dipping them in egg and bread 
crumbs. Drain them well and send to table very hot. 
Garnish with sprigs of parsley and slices of lemon. 

OYSTER CUTLETS— 2. 
Two dozen oysters, two ounces of butter, one ounce of 
flour, one-fourth pint of cream, three eggs, pepper, salt and 
bread crumbs. Melt the butter, add the flour, the yolks of 
three eggs, pepper and salt. Cut the oysters in half, and 
cook about five minutes in the sauce, but do not let them 
boil ; turn on to a dish to cool, when cold, form into cutlets. 
Cover with the whites of the eggs, and fry in boiling hot 
fat ; serve very hot. 



OYSTERS. 35 

OYSTERS ON CRACKERS. 

An appetizing dish that is easily prepared is oysters 
baked in crackers. Take little butter crackers or any small 
round crackers that will split readily ; split them ; dip the 
pieces in hot water and then spread each half thickly with 
soft butter. Lay half the pieces upon a biscuit tin and place 
an oyster upon each piece ; put a few drops of lemon juice 
upon each oyster and sprinkle them with salt and pepper 
and a dash of mace. Cover the oysters with the remaining 
buttered halves of crackers, brush the tops with melted 
butter, place them in a4iot oven and bake them from five 
to ten minutes and serve as soon as they are taken from the 
oven.

of cream, one tablespoonful of curry powder, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one-half a tablespoonful of lemoh juice. 
Fry the cocoanut, apple and onion in the butter until they 
are soft, then add the oysters and let all come to the boiling 
point, then add slowly the cream with the curry and flour 
rubbed together into the cream ; let all boil, and take from 
the fire in a minute, then add the lemon juice. Serve at 
once as the oysters harden by long cooking. Serve with 
boiled rice. Lobsters, Crabs and Shrimps can be cooked in 
the same way. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL. 

(To Serve Before a Dinner.) 

The juice of two lemons, half cup of tomato catsup, 
four drops of tobasco sauce, one teaspoonful of Worcestshire 
sauce, one-half teaspoonful of salt ; mix together. Fill 
small punch glasses with oysters, pour over the sauce. 
Serve hot toasted crackers with the oysters. 

OYSTER CROQUETTES. 

One quart of oysters, stew them for three minutes in 
their own liquor, then drain them ; when they are cool 
slice them ; this is a better way than to chop them. Pre- 



36 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

pare a sauce with one tablespoonful of butter and one table- 
spoonful of flour, a few drops of lemon juice or one table- 
spoonful of chopped shallots ; let these boil for five minutes ; 
if too thick thin with a little of the oyster liquor, then add 
the yolks of three eggs well beaten, a little cayenne, one 
saltspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley and 
the juice of one lemon ; put in the oysters and let all boil 
three minutes, then spread the mixture on a platter ; when 
cool make into balls, flattened at each end and about one 
inch thick ; roll them in fine cracker crumbs, then in beaten 
egg, then in cracker crumbs. Have the fat deep and very 
hot, place the croquettes in the frying basket and fry for 
only two minutes. Serve the croquettes hot and with slices 
of lemon. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Fifty large oysters ; always use large oysters for frying ; 
wipe them dry in a clean towel. Beat one egg lightly, add 
to it one teaspoonful of warm water. Roll some cracker 
crumbs very fine, season the crumbs with salt, pepper and 
a very little nutmeg. Dip the oysters into the egg, then 
roll them in the crumbs, place them on a platter so that 
they will not touch each other ; place in the ice box for two 
hours. Put fat into the frying kettle ; when it is very hot 
put in the oysters ; the fat must be deep so as to cover the 
oysters, when brown drain them. Keep hot until served. 
Garnish the dish with slices of lemon and parsley. 

FRIED OYSTERS WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 

Select large oysters, drain them and wipe them dry 
with a clean coarse towel, then dip them into the follow- 
ing batter : Cook one cup of tomatoes, when hot put in one 
tablespoonful of flour, a little salt and cayenne, a very little 
nutmeg and three drops of onion juice (if liked), the batter 
should be very thick ; strain through the sieve and let it 
cool, then dip each oyster into this instead of into beaten 
egg, then into fine bread crumbs. Place them on the ice 
for two or three hours before frying ; when needed— fry 
them in deep, boiling fat and serve hot. 



OYSTERS. 37 

FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

One hundred oysters, one-fourth pound of butter. 
Brown the butter, then put in the oysters and let simmer 
for ten minutes ; rub one tablespoonful of flour and butter 
together, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a little salt 
and pepper, and add just before serving three yolks of eggs 
well beaten. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Fill the shells of puff paste with oysters. Cook the 
oysters first in rich cream, slightly thickened, seasoned with 
salt and powdered mace. 

OYSTERS A LA POULETTE. 

One pint of oysters, put them into a stew-pan and let 
them come to the boiling point, but not let them boil. 
Place in another stew-pan one tablespoonful of butter, when 
melted add one tablespoonful of flour ; stir until these boil. 
Mix with one-half a cup of cream the yolks of two eggs, a 
little cayenne and salt ; pour this mixture into the stew-pan 
with the butter and flour, slowly and stir constantly until 
it boils, then remove from the fire and strain it over the 
oysters, and serve hot. 

OYSTER POURETTE. 

Boil fifty oysters in their own juice, drain them and 
add a dressing of rolled crackers, two yolks of eggs, one 
large tablespoonful of butter, one wine glass of wine, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Serve hot. 

OYSTERS WITH CELERY. 

Twenty-five oysters ; take one tablespoonful of butter, 
when hot, add one tablespoonful of flour; when these 
bubble add the oysters and one-half cup of chopped celery, 
a little salt and pepper. Cook for five minutes. 

OYSTERS TO SERVE RAW. 

Have the oysters opened carefully ; see that no bit of 
shell is left on them ; serve on their own shell ; arrange five 
on each plate ; place the oyster shells on a small bed of 
pounded ice ; put one-quarter of a lemon with each portion. 



38 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

OYSTER SALAD. 

Boil one hundred oysters in a little of their own liquor, 
or in half liquor and half milk — the milk makes the oysters 
whiter than the liquor alone ; let the oysters boil for five 
minutes, remove from the fire, drain them carefully, pour 
over them a French salad dressing and place them on the 
ice. When required drain them from the salad dressing and 
pour over a mayonnaise dressing.

BEEF. 



TO BOIL BEEF. 

Always simmer the meat, in this way meat which other- 
wise would be tough, is rendered tender and savory and 
inexpensive pieces are made palatable, juicy and nourishing. 

BOULETTES. 
A palatable way of using cold meats, roasted meat 
only ; mince the meat very fine, add a little fat bacon or 
salt pork ; chop an onion a teaspoonful of herbs one tea- 
spoonful of parsley together, add one teaspoonful of salt, 
one-half teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce, juice of one-half 
lemon, two eggs. Mix all well together, make into flat 
balls about one-half inch thick, fry in lard or butter until a 
light brown. 

BRAISED BEEF. 
Lay a piece of beef of about five pounds in a broad 
pot ; place sliced onions on the top, a little salt and one cup- 



40 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

ful of stock or gravy, and one cupful of boiling water ; 
cover the pot tightly, add more stock or water if the gravy 
sinks too low ; when done — one hour will cook the meat — 
dredge the beef with flour, take it from the pot, put into a 
pan and place in a hot oven ; as the flour browns, baste the 
beef with butter-water. Ten minutes will be time enough 
to brown the beef; strain the gravy, take off the fat, take 
one tablespoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of tomato catsup, 
boil until the gravy is thickened ; pour one-half over the 
meat, the other serve in the gravy-boat. 

BEEF A LA MODE. 
Fourteen pounds round of beef with bone ; make in 
this four incisions half way through ; take one tablespoonful 
of black pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, rub these into the 
cuts, then mix together one pound of beef chopped fine 
and one pound of suet chopped coarsely, mix, season and 
add one tablespoonful of cloves, two tablespoonfuls of all- 
spice, one clove of garlic, fill the cuts, bind a cloth around 
the beef, cook like roast beef — do not baste. Make a rich 
gravy. 

CORNED BEEF. 
The best piece is from the round, though both the 
rump and brisket pieces are very good. Put the beef into 
a kettle, cover with cold water, bring it to the boiling point, 
skim carefully and put back on the range to simmer — do 
not let it boil at all ; allow twenty-five minutes to each 
pound. Keep the water in which the beef was boiled ; re- 
turn the beef which was left from dinner into this, cover 
and put away to cool ; this renders the beef very tender. 
Do not cook cabbage with the beef, cook separately, if both 
are desired. The water in which the beef was boiled, if 
not too salt, is a good foundation for either split pea, po- 
tato or bean soup. 

CORNED BEEF HASH. 
The corned beef should be quite salt, cured with some 
salt-petre ; simmer, not boil, until very tender ; when done 
spread a napkin wrung out in cold water over it to prevent 
it turning black. Potatoes that boil mealy are not good ; 
boil them with the skins on rather underdone and do not 



BKKF. 41 

use until cold. Chop the beef very fine, the potatoes 
coarser, twice as much potato as meat. Put milk or cream 
(cream is better), butter and pepper into a large old- 
fashioned spider ; when hot add the hash, not more than one 
and one-half inches deep ; do not stir it. Keep drawing 
away from the sides of the pan with a spoon, but not to 
mash it. Cook for an hour or more, quickly at first, then 
set back on the range to simmer. 

Prepare the beef and potatoes the night before using, 
pack all into a bowl and cover closely : it is ready then for 
breakfast — do not spare the butter, if you use cream not so 
much butter is necessary. 

CORNED BEEF WITH CREAM. 
Two cups of cooked corned beef grated, one-half a 
cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Mix together, heat thoroughly, and serve on toast. 

BEEF DRIPPING, TO PREPARE. 
Cut the beef suet into small pieces, place in saucepan 
with a very little water ; be careful the suet does not burn, 
as it melts pour into a bowl ; when cold all the impurities 
will be on the bottom of the cake and can be scraped off. 

BROILED FILLET OF BEEF. 
Take one pound of fillet of beef, broil it nicely, but not 
too much ; have in readiness some maitre d' hotel butter 
made thus : Three ounces of butter, one dessert-spoonful of 
minced parsley, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, and a little 
pepper and salt ; work all these ingredients into a cake and 
let it grow cold. After broiling the fillet, place a piece of 
maitre d'hotel butter as big as a walnut on the top. 

HOT POT. 

Cut small pieces of beef from the shank or round, cut 
potatoes in thin slices ; put layer of beef, a little salt and 
pepper, add little bits of butter and a few drops of onion 
juice, if onion flavoring is liked, continue the beef and po- 
tatoes, having potatoes the last layer, until the dish is nearly 
full, then add a cupful of good stock or hot water. Cover 
the dish .tightly and bake for two or three hours ; it is well 
to serve it in the dish in which it is baked. 



43 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

HASH. 

Hash, made as the recipe for corned beef hash, of 
either corned beef or roast meat, is very nice baked in gem 
pans, instead of cooking it in the skillet ; when baked turn 
from the pans and serve on slices of hot toast. 

HAMBURG STEAK. 
Use for the steak the ends of the beefsteak, or meat from 
the round of beef; chop very fine two pounds of meat, with 
a little of the suet, remove as much of the meat fiber as pos- 
sible ; add one saltspoonful of pepper one teaspoonful of 
salt, one tablespoonful of minced onion (this is not neces- 
sary), press the meat together and make into small flat 
cakes, or in one large one ; broil for five minutes over a clear 
fire, or cook in the skillet, which must be very hot and 
slightly greased before the meat is put in ; five minutes will 
cook the meat ; put melted butter over the cakes, and serve 
very hot. 

MOCK HARE. 

Three pounds of round steak, one-half pound of salt 
pork, all chopped fine; one onion scraped or grated, two 
eggs w^ell beaten, six crackers rolled fine, one tablespoonful 
of pepper, one-half tablespoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls 
of milk or stock, and make into two loaves, like bread, 
scatter cracker crumbs over the tops and bits of butter, and 
baste often. Bake one hour. Thicken the gravy with one 
tablespoonful of butter and flour, then add one can of 
mushrooms. Serve one loaf hot with the mushrooms or a 
tomato sauce ; the other loaf serve cold, sliced thin. 

MEAT FIBRIN. 
For enriching sauces and soups. Take four pounds of 
liver ; cut it into long, slender strips ; roll it in a mixture of 
the following. One-half ounce each of allspice, mace, nut- 
meg, celery salt, black pepper and cloves, all well pounded, 
after which roll it thickly in flour. It will take longer to 
dry in the oven than any other meat. When quite dry grind 
it and mix it with one-quarter pound of heated salt. Bottle 
and cork. Use it in the proportion of one dessertspoonful 
to one pint of good stock. 



BEEF. 43 

MOCK DUCK.

skewer ; roast for one hour, then remove from the pan ; 
place it on a hot dish. Thicken the gravy with one table- 
spoonful of flour and strain over the steak. 

BEEF OLIVES. 
Have thin slices cut from the round of beef, slightly 
beat them to make them level ; brush them over with a 
beaten egg, sprinkle with some sifted sweet herbs ; season 
with a little salt and pepper; roll up the slices and fasten 
with a little w^ooden toothpick. Put into the stewpan one 
pint of stock or one pint of hot water, then lay the olives 
side by side, closely ; put over them some thin slices of 
bacon, stew them very slowly for two hours ; take them from 
the pan, remove the skewers ; thicken the gravy with one- 
half tablespoonful of flour and one-half tablespoonful of 
butter rubbed togethei: ; pour this over the olives. A few 
drops of Worcestershire sauce or tomato catsup can be added 
if liked. 

OX HEART. 

This is a very economical dish ; it is really very nice. 
Soak the heart in vinegar and water three hours, then cut 
off the lobes and gristle ; stuff the heart with salt fat pork 
chopped fine, the same amount of fine bread crumbs, a little 
parsley chopped, a little thyme, pepper and salt; tie up the 
heart in a cloth and let it slowly simmer for two hours, the 
large end up, then remove from the fire take off the cloth, 
flour the heart and roast it until it is browned ; lay some 
pieces of fat pork in the pan and some over the heart, make 
a gravy by stirring in the pan a tablespoonful of flour and 
a teacupful of hot water.

To one gallon of water, add salt enough to float an egg ; 
one tablespoonful of saltpetre, cover closely and let it stand 
for three days. Rub the beef to be corned well with salt 



44 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

and let it remain in the dry salt for three days, then wash 
carefully, rub again with salt, adding one tablespoonful of 
saltpetre to the salt ; let the beef remain in the dry salt for 
ten days, then place in the pickle, and cover closely for one 
month. Beef prepared in this manner can keep perfectly 
for a year, but it is absolutely necessary that all the blood 
be extracted from the beef. 

BEEFSTEAK PIE. 

One and one-half pounds of fine, juicy beefsteak, cut 
into pieces about an inch square, season them well with 
salt and pepper and dredge flour over them. Make a suet 
crust, butter a quart bowl well and line it with the-crust, 
press the crust gently on to the bowl ; fill the bowl with the 
meat and one small cupful of cold water ; leave enough 
crust over the edge to form a cover — be sure there are no 
holes in the crust for the gravy to escape, pinch the edges 
together, tie a floured cloth over the bowl — be careful to tie 
it well and firmly down, bring up the four ends of the cloth 
over the top and tie them, plunge the bowl into boiling 
water, and boil gently for two hours. 

BEEFSTEAK PUDDING. 

Make a paste of one pound of flour, one-half pound of 
finelychoppedbeef suet, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and one- 
half pint of cold water. Roll out the paste until one-half

of the pastry to fold over the top. Take one pound of beef- 
steak, dredge with flour, cut into small pieces, with one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one 
tablespoonful of water ; fill the pudding dish, fold over the 
crust, and cover the bowl with a clean cloth floured— tie it 
over tightly, put the pudding into boiling water and boil

ROAST BEEF. 
In roasting meat the oven should always be hot so that 
the meat will brown at once— the gravy which exudes, con- 
geals on the outside and forms a glaze ; this glaze seals the 
pores of the meat. Never put w^ater in the pan, and do not 
flour the meat, and never put the salt or pepper on the joint 
before it is cooked or while it is cooking ; when the meat is 
done pour off the fat from the pan, remove the meat, pour a 
little boiling water into the pan, carefully scrape off every 
bit of the glaze on the bottom of the pan, add a little salt 
and pepper, but no flour — the gravy will be thick enough 
without any. 

SIRLOIN OF BEEF. 
The sirloin of beef, about ten pounds, makes three good 
meals ; the thin end can be corned ; the fillet is considered 
the " epicure's piece.'' The roast is a good one and looks 
well on the table. It is important to remember that the 
smaller the cut to be roasted the hotter should be the fire, 
for an intensely hot fire coagulates the exterior and prevents 
the drying up of the meat juices. Do not apply this to 
large pieces of meat, for meat is a poor conductor of heat, 
and a large piece of meat exposed to intense heat would 
burned and changed to charcoal before the heat had pene- 
trated to the interior. 

A GOOD STEW. 
Take an earthenware jar, put in the bottom a few slices 
of bacon, on this a layer of potatoes, then a layer of onions, 
some chopped parsley, a little sprinkle of sweet herbs, pep- 
per and salt, and a little grated nutmeg, then a layer of 
good beef or mutton, then repeat the vegetables, etc., until 



48 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

the jar is filled, finishing with a few slices of bacon ; cover 
tightly and place in a deep pan half filled with boiling water 
and bake for three hours. 

BEEF TRIFLES. 

Take a pound of cold roast beef, mince it very finely, 
then put into a basin and mix with it a seasoning of salt 
and pepper, three ounces of melted butter, two tablespoon- 
fuls of finely grated horse radish, six tablespoonfuls of fine 
bread crumbs, and a tablespoonful of minced onion. Mix 
these ingredients thoroughly, then moisten well with two 
beaten eggs. Put the mixture into small well buttered 
cups or molds, bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes, 
then turn out and garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley and 
serve with or w^ithout horse radish sauce. 

BONNAR STEW. 

Cut small pieces of meat from the leg, about three 
pounds ; roll all in flour until very while, place in stew pan 
with salt and pepper. Cover with cold water ; simmer 
slowly for five hours. ' This stew will be found very good 
and most nourishing.

MUTTON AND LAMB. 



MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton for boiling should be fresh and not 
hang as long a time as for a roast. 

BREAST OF MUTTON BOILED. 

Place the breast of mutton in the kettle with just 
enough hot water to cover it ; let it come to the boiling point 
and then place on the back of the stove and let it simmer 
for three hours ; then remove from the fire and pull out the 
bones. Make a force-meat of one cup of bread crumbs, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of thyme, 
one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, one-half teacupfulof 
chopped suet ; spread this over the breast of mutton, roll it 
up and fasten with a skewer, dip the roll into beaten egg 
and then into fine bread crumbs, place in the oven and 
brown, basting often with butter-water, for twenty min- 
utes or until well browned. Serve hot, with stewed onions. 

SHEEP'S BRAIN WITH BROWN SAUCE. 

Take four sheep's brains — be careful not to break them, 
put into a basin, cover with warm water, remove theskin 
and let them remain for two hours, then put them into a 



50 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

saucepan, cover with boiling water, add one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, one teaspoonful of salt ; cook until they are firm, 
then put them into cold water for five minutes ; when 
needed, put the brains into one pint of stock, one onion 
stuck with two cloves, one sprig of parsley, one slice of salt 
pork or bacon, and cook for twenty-five minutes. Put on 
a hot dish. Serve with a brown sauce. 

BREAST OF LAMB BROILED. 

Put the breast of lamb into cold water with one onion, 
some parsley or celery, salt and pepper, two cloves and a 
little lemon peel ; simmer until nearly cooked, then take out 
the meat and let it cool ; when cold remove bones, divide it 
into narrow slices, dip each slice into melted butter, then 
into bread crumbs and broil them five minutes and serve. 

BRAISED MUTTON. 
Prepare and cook the same as Braised Beef. 

COLD MUTTON. 
Cut the mutton into chops, dip each piece in beaten 
egg in which put one tablespoonful of milk, then into fine 
bread crumbs and fry in deep hot fat. 

LAMB CHOPS BROILED. 
Proceed as for Mutton Chops. 

CROWN OF LAMB. 

The crown is the side of the lamb with all the ribs 
turned around in a circle to form a crown. The center is 
filled with the trimmings from the bones, when they are 
"Frenched," and a string is tied around the outside to 
keep the crown in shape, and then 3'ou proceed as follows : 
Season the lamb with salt and pepper, place it in a roasting 
pan, put one whole onion in center of the crown. Baste 
the meat all over with melted butter, place the pan in a hot 
oven, roast until the meat begins to brown, then add one 
cup of boiling water or meat stock. Roast, basting very 
frequently till done, which will take about an hour and a 
half. When done, lay the meat on a hot dish, garnish with 
green peas, carrot balls and potato bdlls. Remove all fat 
from the gravy, mix one tablespoonful of corn starch with a 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 5 I 

little cold water, add it to the gravy, cook and stir five min- 
utes, add sufficient meat stock or water to make one pint of 
sauce, cook five minutes, strain and serve with the lamb. 

BROILED CHOPS. 

Remove the fat, beat them with the steak beater, dip in 
melted butter, sprinkle over a little pepper and roll them in 
pounded cracker crumbs, then place over a clear fire and 
broil eight minutes, four for each side ; turn them often, 
serve very hot. A thick chop will take twelve minutes to 
cook ; a thin one nine minutes. Always have the gridiron 
hot before putting on the chop. 

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS. 

Remove the fat from the bone, beat the chops slightly 
to level them. Have the gridiron hot and greased, the fire 
bright and clear ; broil the chops eight minutes, place them 
on a hot platter, arrange them neatly ; put a small piece of 
butter on each chop and a little pepper and salt. Serve the 
chops very hot. Mutton chops should be broiled over a 
clear but not fierce fire ; pour a little salad oil over the chops 
and sprinkle them with a little pepper and salt an hour be- 
fore broiling them. 

IRISH STEW. 

Take two pounds of pieces of mutton (the trimmings 
of chops and the neck make a good stew), two pounds of 
potatoes cut in pieces, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half tea- 
spoonful of pepper, two onions may be added if liked, and 
one carrot, all cut in pieces ; add one pint of water ; let the 
stew simmer for two hours ; add one tablespoonful of butter, 
then serve hot. 

MUTTON AND LAMB KIDNEYS. 

Fry in butter some slices of bread trimmed free from 
crusts ; split six fresh kindeys, after they are washed, freed 
from fat and skin. Season them well with salt and cayenne, 
lay them in the pan and fry in a little butter ; when they 
have cooked for ten minntes remove from the pan, place on 
the slices of fried bread ; thicken the gravy with one table- 



52 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

spoonful of flour, and one teaspoonful of tomato catsup or 
one teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and one teaspoon- 
ful of sherry or port wine. Serve the kidneys very hot. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. 

Have the water boiling ; put in the leg and let it sim- 
mer, not boil, until cooked— all meats are more tender if not 
allowed to boil hard. Allow twenty minutes to each pound ; 
put one onion and one bay leaf into the water, and a little 
salt and pepper. Serve with caper sauce. 

MUTTON PIE. 

Use two pounds from the neck or loin of mutton and 
two kidneys ; take out the bones, put them into one pint of 
water and cook for one-half hour; cut the meat into small 
pieces, cut up the kidneys, mix with the meat, sprinkle over 
one tablespoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper, one tablespoonful of minced onion. Fut these. into a 
deep pie dish with the gravy ; cover with a good pastry, puff 
paste or suet ; bake for one and one-half hours and serve 
hot. 

MINCED MUTTON ON TOAST. 

Mince very fine the remains of cold mutton left from 
the roast or boiled mutton, add to the mince one tea- 
cupful of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little pepper, three drops of onion juice 
(if liked) ; let all become hot, then serve on hot toast. A 
poached egg may be placed on each portion, and will be an 
addition. 

NECK OF MUTTON BOILED. 

Place the neck of mutton in boiling water, to which add 
one tablespoonful of salt ; let it simmer slowly for two hours ; 
then remove from the stew pan and serve with caper sauce, 
or with parsley or butter sauce. The liquor in which the 
neck was boiled should be strained, and the next day it will 
serve as the foundation for a good broth or soup. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 53 

ROAST MUTTON. 

Four days before using, bone and season with the fol- 
lowing mixture : One teaspoonful ground ginger, one tea- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon, one-fourth teaspoonful 
gronnd black pepper, one-fourth teaspoonful ground cloves, 
one-fourth teaspoonful ground mace ; mix together in one- 
half pint hot vinegar in which has been steeped two bay- 
leaves and a small bunch of thyme and sweet marjoram and 
a clove of garlic ; rub the mutton thoroughly with this mix- 
ture — put in a cool dry place for one and one- half days. Fill 
the cavity left by the bone with a stuffing made of celery 
chopped very fine and cooked until tender, mixed with a 
pint of white sauce (the bone will make the necessary stock). 
When the meat is needed, cover with mushrooms chopped 
fine and one-half pound of almonds chopped ; then roast in 
hot oven, baste constantly while cooking, with mixture of 
strained tomatoes and rich stock, one pint of each. A glass 
of cjaret may be added if liked. 

ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

Select a good sized leg of mutton of ten pounds ; in 
winter let it hang for three weeks, unless it has been hung 
for a long time at the butcher's. Before roasting, beat the 
leg well, all over, with the rolling-pin ; this adds greatly to 
the tenderness and delicacy of the meat. Put a clove of 
garlic or a few slices of shallots into the hock end of the leg, 
dredge with flour, spread a little butter over and roast for 
one hour and thirty minutes ; baste the mutton frequently 
with a little boiling water at first, then from the juice in the 
pan. When the mutton is cooked, place on hot platter, strain 
the gravy, skim off the fat. Serve currant jelly with roast 
mutton. 

LEG OF MUTTON STEWED. 

Beat the leg well and rub over a little salt ; grease a tin 
baking pan with butter ; put on the bottom two sliced 
onions, two bay leaves, one carrot sliced, one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, one-half a pint of water, one saltspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth saltspoonful of pepper. Lay the mutton in the pan 
and bake in a hot oven until it is brown, basting often with 



54 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

the gravy in the pan ; when brown, put the mutton in a 
stew pan with all the sauce and vegetables and slowly sim- 
mer closely covered for two hours ; if the gravy dries away 
add a little water; remove the mutton, skim the gravy and 
strain it over the meat. One cucumber stewed in the gravy 
is an addition. 

ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

Trim off all unnecessary fat. Wrap the saddle up well 
in greased paper, tie the paper over, roast in the oven, baste 
it frequently— allow fifteen minutes to each pound. Within 
one-half hour of the time for serving, remove the paper, 
brown the mutton. Serve with a clear gravy, very hot. 

VEAL OR LAMB PIE. 

Have your dish well buttered. Place first a layer of 
cold veal or lamb cut in small dice, then a layer of cold 
boiled potatoes cut in small dice, then a layer of sliced Bard 
boiled eggs, pepper, salt and a little chopped onion and 
parsley, till the dish is within an inch of the top ; add 
enough stock well seasoned to fill the dish ; cover with a 
pie crust, and bake ten minutes or ,long enough to brown 
the crust. 



VEAL.

VEAL. 



BREAST OF VEAL FRICASSEED. 

Lay the breast of veal in warm water to whiten for a 
few minutes, then cut the meat into small pieces. Put in 
the stew-pan one-half a tablespoonful of butter, one onion, 
one carrot, a sprig of thyme and a thin slice of lemon peal, 
a little salt and pepper ; dredge the meat with flour, put it 
in the stew-pan w^ith one pint of water ; simmer for two 
hours — the meat must not brown ; when ready to serve, 
take out the meat, skim the fat from the gravy and add the 
yolks of two eggs well beaten, and the juice of one lemon, 
one cup of white bread crumbs, a little salt and nutmeg; 
stir these well into the sauce and serve with the veal. 

VEAL BIRDS. 

Veal birds are made in Austria from slices of uncooked 
veal, covered with thin slices of bacon and a sage leaf, then 
tied up and roasted. There is, however, no reason why 
they should not be stewed in this way. A foundation gravy 



56 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

is made of a mixture of white stock and cream, flavored 
with lemon peel, parsley, cayenne, and a dash each of salt 
and nutmeg. The "birds" must stew in this for about two 
hours ; they are nicest when made small enough to serve 
one to a person. This same gravy is good to serve with 
cooked veal minced. 

BLANQUETTE OF VEAL. 

Use the breast of veal. Take three pounds of veal, cut 
into pieces about two inches square ; put these into the 
stew-pan and cover with water ; add one saltspoonful of salt 
and one-half saltspoonful of pepper ; boil, and then add 
two onions, two cloves, a bunch of sweet helfcs ; simmer 
gently together for one hour, then drain the veal from the 
broth. Stir one tablespoonful of flour and one tablespoon- 
ful of butter together in a stew-pan until smooth, add the 
broth, which must have been strained, stir together ; add the 
beaten yolks of two eggs, strain over the veal and let it all just 
come to a boil, add one tablespoonful of chopped parsley and 
serve hot. Blanquette of veal can be made from the remains 
of cold roast veal ; avoid boiling the veal again, only let it 
become hot. 

VEAL SCALLOPS. 

Take thin slices of veal, cut them into pieces about an 
inch square, season with a little salt and pepper and some 
sweet herbs, dip each piece in the yolk of egg, then into 
bread crumbs ; fry some pieces of salt pork, remove these 
from the pan and put in the scallops, fry them brown and 
then add one cup of stock, one-half cup of cream or milk, 
one cup of oysters or mushrooms and one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice. 

CREAM OF VEAL— I. 

Take a pound of fillet of veal, pound it in a mortar with 
an equal part of milk panada. Mix and stir in the beaten 
yolk of one egg and the whipped whites of two, and 
sufficient cream to make into a paste ; add a little pepper 
and salt. Place this in well-buttered molds ; steam for an 
hour ; be sure and do not let it boil. Turn out and serve 
with either tomato sauce or a puree of spinach. 



VEAL. 



57 



CREAM OF VEAL— 2. 



Two pounds of veal cutlet, pound it until soft and thin, 
then cut into finger lengths and about one inch wide, dip 
each piece into beaten egg, then into fine bread crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper and a little nutmeg. Put one 
tablespoonful of butter into the pan ; when it is hot put in 
the veal, brown the slices on both sides, then place them on 
a hot dish. Pour into the pan two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
let it boil once, then strain this gravy over the veal. Serve 
with slices of lemon. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 
Have the cutlets free from bone if possible ; trim them 
into a proper shape and beat them well with the pastry roller 
until the fibre of the meat is broken ; this process improves 
veal, but it is injurious to many other meats. Dip each cut- 
let in flour or in beaten egg and bread crumbs and fry for 
fifteen minutes in good fat, either of dripping or lard, not 
a deep fat. Then remove the cutlets from the fat and pour 
out the fat. Put into the pan one tablespoonful of flour 
and one tablespoonful of butter ; cook these together for a 
minute, then add one cup of broth or boiling water, one 
spoonful of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of salt, one-half a 
saltspoonful of pepper ; strain the gravy over the cutlets 
and serve hot. 

FRIED VEAL CUTLETS WITH CREAM GRAVY. 

Take two pounds of veal from the leg, cut into small 
round pieces ; dip each piece into flour with one teaspoonful 
of salt and a little pepper. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter 
in the frying pan, when hot put in the cutlets and fry 
slowly until they are brown and tender, then remove ; pour 
into the pan one teacup of cream, let it just boil, then strain 
over the meat. Serve hot. 

VEAL CUTLETS WITH MACARONI. 

Use three pounds of veal cutlets from the neck, one- 
fourth pound of macaroni broken into four-inch pieces ; put 
into one pint of boiling water ; when boiling put on the back 
of range to simmer for thirty minutes, then pour in one tea- 
cupful of cold water ; this is the correct way to prevent the 



58 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

macaroni from pulping ; add one saltspoonful of salt. Make 
a gravy from some fine stock, thicken with one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, add one tablespoonful of some good catsup, 
drain the macaroni and put it into the gravy. Cook the 
cutlets ; first put them in the beaten yolk of egg, then into 
bread crumbs, fry them in fat until they are brown, add a 
sprinkle of thyme over them and a few drops of lemon/ 
juice. Place the macaroni and cutlets on a hot dish and 
sprinkle with paprika. Serve the gravy in small dish. 

TO PREPARE CALVES' BRAINS FOR COOKING. 

Wash the brains in cold water, drain them, cover again 
with cold water, in which put a tablespoonful of good 
vinegar or lemon juice and one saltspoonful of salt ; let the 
brains soak in this mixture for twenty minutes. Put in the 
saucepan some boiling salted water, drain the brains and 
put them into the saucepan with one onion, one bay leaf, 
six peppercorns and six cloves ; let them cook for thirty 
minutes, then drain them and put them again into cold 
water ; when cold pinch off all the fibers you can without 
breaking the brains. 

CALF'S BRAINS. 
Soak the brains in cold water for one hour, remove all 
the skinny parts, be careful not to bruise the brains ; when 
they are clean and white put them into a stew-pan with one 
quart of water, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, and boil gently for twenty minutes, then remove 
from the pan and let them become cold ; cut them in pieces, 
dip each piece in beaten egg, then into bread crumbs; fry in 
deep hot fat. Serve with a tomato sauce. 

BAKED OR FRIED CALF'S BRAINS. 
Wash the brains, then cook them in salt water for 
twenty minutes, place on a plate and put a plate over them 
and a weight ; when cold, slice the brains, dip in beaten 
egg, then in cracker dust, then in egg, and fry them in a 
little butter, or bake them in the oven. 

CROQUETTES OF CALF'S BRAINS. 
Wash the brains thoroughly till they become white, re- 
move the skin and fibers, then pound them till smooth in a 



VEAL. 59 

mortar. Season with pepper, salt and a pinch of white 
sugar. Add two ounces of milk panada, a beaten egg and 
a teaspoonful of flour ; leave the mixture to get quite cold 
before rolling into balls, then dip in beaten egg and bread 
crumbs and fry a pale color. Oyster sauce or sauce piquante 
should be served with this dish. 

FRICANDEAU OF VEAL— i. 
Use three pounds of the fillet of veal, take out the bone, 
trim the piece nicely and lard the top with thin strips of 
salt pork ; put into the stew-pan the bone and trimmings of 
veal, with one carrot, one onion cut fine, a little salt and 
pepper; lay on the top of these the veal, add one-half pint 
of broth, boil until the broth is thick, then add one pint 
more of broth, and simmer all for one and one-half hours ; 
baste the fricandeau every few minutes, when it is browned 
take from the pan. Skim off the fat and strain the gravy 
and serve over the meat ; place the fricandeau on a bed of 
cooked spinach. 

FRICANDEAU OF VEAL— 2. 
Use four pounds of veal (the fat side of the leg), one pint 
of broth, four ounces of lean ham, one faggot of sweet herbs, 
one carrot, one onion, two bay leaves, one blade of mace, 
one-fourth pound of fat bacon for larding, eight artichoke 
bottoms, six truffles, four mushrooms. Beat your frican- 
deau with a rolling-pin, take off the skin and trim off the 
rough edges, lard the top and sides, cover it with fat bacon, 
lay it in a stew-pan with some trimmings of raw veal under- 
neath it, also the onion and carrot cut up small, the herbs, 
mace, the lean ham, pepper, add salt and a pint of broth. 
Cover the pan close and let it stew^ slowly three hours, then 
take up the meat, remove all fat from the gravy, boil quickly 
to a glaze, then glaze the fricandeau. Make a rich gravy, 
add the mushrooms, truffles and artichoke bottoms, and 
serve round the meat. 

CALF'S FEET FRITTERS. 

Boil two calf's feet as for jelly, but do not let them stew 

till they fall to pieces, but while they are still firm take them 

out of the stock, split them open, remove the bones (which 

you return to the stock for sweet jelly), and lay the cover- 



6o THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

ings of them flat in a dish to get cold. Then cut them into 
small, cutlet-like pieces, dip each into batter and fry alight 
color. Drain them well from the fat, pile high on a dish 
and pour either tomato sauce around or a sauce composed of 
a half pint of stock, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, 
one of chutnee, a little salt, a lump of sugar, thicken with 
corn-starch and boil the sauce well before serving. 

CALF'S HEAD BOILED. 
Have the head thoroughly cleaned, scraped and split 
open ; see that the ears are clean ; then put the head in cold 
water for an hour. Remove the brains ; be careful not to 
break them and put them into a basin and cover with cold 
w^ater. Put the head into a large enough kettle that the 
water will entirely cover it, bring the water quickly to the 
boiling point, skim and then put the kettle on the cooler 
part of the stove and simmer the head for three hours ; add 
one teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth leaspoonful of pep- 
per, remove from the fire ; remove the large bones and pour 
over the head either Brown, Parsley, Tomato or Bechamel 
sauce. The water in which the head was cooked may be 
used for mock turtle soup, or a white soup. 

CALF'S HEAD TERRAPIN. 

One pint of cold calf's head cut into small pieces, one 
cup of the water in which the head was cooked, one-half a 
teacupful of cream, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a little 
cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of sherry, the yolks of two 
eggs, one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of 
flour. 

Put the stock into the stew pan or chafing dish ; beat 
the flour and the butter well together and stir into the boil- 
ing stock, stir constantly until thick and smooth; add the 
meat, salt and pepper and cook for five minutes, then 
remove from the fire or put out the lamp of the chafing dish 
and add the sherry. 

Cold chicken, turkey, game and veal are all very good 
treated in this manner. 

FRENCH PIE. 
One and one-half pounds of calf's liver, one-half pound 
of unsmoked fat bacon, one-fourth pound of cold roast veal, 



VEAL. 6l 

rabbit or chicken, one-half teaspoonful of white pepper, 
one and one-half ounces of gelatine, one onion, one pint 
of stock, cayenne, nutmeg, mace and salt to taste. Boil 
the calf's liver till tender ; when cold put twice through 
.the mincing machine with the onion, pound in a mortar and 
season highly with pepper, salt, cayenne, mace and nut- 
meg. Soak the gelatine and melt it with the stock ; line a 
china mold with the bacon cut into very thin slices, then 
put a layer of the cooked meat or poultry, next a layer of 
the pounded liver, and soon, till the mold is full; pour in 
some of the stock in which the gelatine has been melted, 
cover the top with bacon, and bake in a moderate oven. 
Do not turn it out of the mold till next day. 

ITALIAN CHEESE. 
One pound and a half of calf's liver, cover it with 
boiling water for five minutes, then dry with a soft cloth 
and chop it very fine ; chop one pound of veal and one-half 
pound of ham fine and mix with the liver, add one onion 
chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, a 
little cayenne and a pinch of powered sage. Mix all well 
together and put into a buttered mold, cover tightly and 
steam or boil for three hours, then remove the cover, pour 
off any liquid from the top, pour this into a saucepan and 
while hot, add to it one-fourth of a box of gelatine which 
has been previously soaked in a teacup of cold water, stir 
until the gelatine is dissolved, add a little salt and pepper, 
pour this into the mold over the cheese ; it will fill up all 
the places which have shrunk in the cooking ; shake the 
mold so as to have the liquid settle around the sides ; leave 
it to cool, w^hen cold turn on a platter and garnish with 
slices of lemon and sprays of parsley. 

LIVER AND BACON. 
Cook in a frying pan as many slices of bacon as may 
be required ; place them on a heated dish and put them 
where they will keep hot. Lay the liver in the frying pan 
where the bacon has been cooked, sprinkle it generously 
with salt and pepper and cook rare. Place the liver on a 
hot plate and with a sharp knife cut the meat into thin 
strips, removing all the stringy and gristly parts. Return 



63 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

the liver to the frying pan, add a generous piece of butter 
and more salt and pepper, and stir it around' with a fork, 
letting the meat become thoroughly heated. Turn it into the 
center of a hot platter, place the bacon around it arrd serve. 

BRAISED LIVER. 

Two and one-half pounds of calf's liver, three small 
onions, one can of mushrooms, one bunch of parsley, one- 
eighth pound of butter, one-half pound of salt pork, one 
lemon. Lard the liver with the pork, melt the butter in the 
pot (a small iron one, with a tight cover, is the best for 
this "preparation), then put in the onions, mushrooms, 
parsley and lemon ; put in the liver, cover tightly that no 
steam escapes. Cook for two hours ; remove from the pot, 
strain the gravy and pour over the liver. 

BAKED CALF'S LIVER. 
Take one liver, pour over it boiling water and skin it ; 
wash it in several waters, lard with bacon or salt pork. 
Put in a pan a little bit of sliced onion, a carrot sliced and 
a little water, put in the liver, which you cover well with 
onions sliced ; sprinkle all with flour, and baste often in a 
hot oven. Bake one and one-half hours. 

CALF'S LIVER CAKE. 
Pound in the mortar the best part of the calf's liver ; it 
must be perfectly fresh ; add an equal quantity of boiled 
salt pork, pound this in a mortar w^ith some parsley, a little 
salt and pepper. Slice two onions very fine and fry them 
with a little suet dripping. Cut into fine dice enough ham 
to make one-half a cupful, add this to the liver and pork, 
add three eggs beaten separately, beat these well into the 
meat ; grease a plain mo)d and fill with the mixture and 
steam for three hours. Turn out the cake on a platter and 
garnish with thin slices of broiled bacon. 

CALF'S LIVER LARDED. 
The operation of larding is done by passing strips of 
larding pork, which is firm, white, fat pork, cut two inches 
long, and quarter of an inch square, in rows along the 
surface of the liver, placing the strips of pork in the split 
end of a larding needle, and with it taking a stitch about a 



VBAL. 63 

quarter of an inch deep and one inch long in the surface of 
the liver, and leaving the ends of the pork projecting 
equally ; the rows must be inserted regularly — the ends of 
the second coining between the ends of the first, and so on, 
until the surface is covered. The liver is then laid in a 
dripping pan on one ounce of carrot, one ounce of onions 
and one ounce of salt pork sliced, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
quarter of a saltspoonful of pepper, three sprigs of parsley, 
one of thyme, three bay leaves, and six cloves ; a gill of 
of Spanish sauce or brown gravy is poured over it and it is 
cooked in a moderate oven about an hour until it is thor- 
oughly done.

ROAST SUCKING PIG. 

After the little pig is scalded and prepared for cooking 
wipe it dry and stuff the body with bread crumbs mixed 
with one teaspoonful of sage, one teaspoonful of salt, a little 
cayenne, a little melted butter, all well mixed together. Sew 
up so that the stuffing will not fall out ; cut off the feet and 
place the pig in a pan with an apple in his mouth ; score the 
skin, baste the pig constantly with the gravy that comes 
from the pig, roast four hours ; when ready to serve split 
open the body and remove the stuffing, cut off the head, split 
it open and take out the brains ; mix the stuffing and the 
brains well together, add one glass of sherry and the gravy 
which has come from the pig, a little nutmeg, one table- 
spoonful of lemon juice and a little cayenne. Serve this 
sauce in the gravy-boat or Piquante sauce. Serve apple 
sauce with the pig also. The pig must be well basted at 
first with hot water, in which put a pinch of salt, then pour 
off the w^ater from the pan and baste with olive oil. 

SALT PORK FOR LARDING. 

Salt pork used for larding should be cut in very narrow 
strips and thrown into ice-water for a few minutes before 
using. The ice-water hardens the pork. 



68 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

BACON. 

Bacon can be boiled the same as ham, three hours' time 
required for a piece of four pounds ; when cooked remove 
the skin, sprinkle the top with fine bread crumbs and a little 
brown sugar and brown in the oven. Boiled bacon is 
especially nice, served with boiled chicken. 

BROILED BACON. 

Slice the bacon in very thin slices, cut off the hard lean 
and the rind ; put on the fine wire broiler, cook over a clear 
fire, five minutes. K^eep the bacon in a cool, dry place; if 
the slices are placed in the ice-box for a few hours before 
needed, it will be found an improvement. 

CLEAR BACON FRIED. 

Cut off the hard, lean strip from the bacon, then cut 
the slices one-eighth of an inch thick; have the frying-pan- 
very hot, lay in the slices of bacon, turn as soon as they are 
clear, cook a moment on the other side and remove from 
the fire. 

TO COOK BACON. 

Cut the slices very thin, let them stand in the refriger- 
ator for some hours before cooking. 

PORK CUTLETS. 

Three pounds of the loin of pork, three ounces of but- 
ter, lemon juice, three tomatoes, one carrot, one turnip, one 
parsnip, one apple, one ounce of glaze, chopped parsley, 
one pound of chestnuts, pepper and salt. Take a very 
young and tender piece of loin of pork, cut it into delicate 
cutlets, fry the cutlets in two ounces of butter quickly ; boil 
your carrot, turnip, apple, parsnip, and cut them into thin 
strips ; keep the vegetables warm. Boil your chestnuts very 
soft and take the shell and skin off. Pound with pepper, 
salt, and an ounce of butter, and rub through a sieve; 
arrange as a wall on which to dish your cutlets. Bake 
your tomatoes and use them to garnish the dish. Fill the 
center of the chestnut wall with the cut-up vegetables ; 
pour the melted glaze round the cutlets ; squeeze the lemon 
juice over all. 



PORK. 69 

"POOR MAN'S GOOSE." 

Take the liver, heart and sweetbreads of the pig, wash 
them thoroughly. Slice four onions fine, put into the 
baking pan, with one teaspoonful of dried sage ; cut the 
liver into small pieces, lay them with the onions, then cut 
up the heart and then the sweetbreads, pepper all well, and 
cover with thin slices of bacon or salt pork ; set the tin in a 
good oven, bake for one hour, then add one cup of boiling 
water. Send this to the table in the pan in which it was 
cooked. Serve with it, plain boiled potatoes. 

The bacon mentioned in Foreign Cook Books, is equiva- 
lent to our salt, pickled, or mess pork ; not the smoked sides 
and shoulders we call bacon. 

Children as a rule do not like meat fats ; but use bacon 
fat for frying potatoes and they will like it. 

VIRGINIA LIVER PUDDING. 

Soak the pigs' livers over one day and night in salt and 
water, changing the water frequently. Soak the pigs' 
heads in salt and water for the same time, allow two livers 
to every head. After soaking the livers and heads, wash 
them carefully and boil them until soft, remove the bones 
from the heads, put livers and heads through the meat 
chopper, season the meat highly with salt and pepper, mix 
together, heat thoroughly and pour into shallow pans. 
Keep in a cool dry place ; when required, slice in thin 
slices, and fry in. a hot pan and serve. 

PIG'S FEET BROILED. 

Have the feet well w^ashed and cleansed, then place in 
a large stew-pan, cover with boiling water, with one 
tablespoonful of salt for twelve feet ; let the water boil 
once, skim, then place the stew-pan on the back of the 
stove and let the feet simmer for six hours. At the end of 
this time, take from the fire, and let the contents become 
cold. When cold place in a stone crock and if desired pour 
over two cups of vinegar and two teaspoonfuls of whole 
spice boiled together. When desired dip the feet in flour 
which has been well seasoned with salt and pepper and 
broil over hot coals for eight minutes.

HAM BROILED. 

Slice the ham in thin slices ; have the gridiron hot, 
put on the ham and cook quickly. 

HAM FRIED WITH EGGS. 

Slice the ham in thin slices, fry them in the frying 
pan ; when cooked, rtemove to a dish and keep hot ; break 
the eggs into the hot fat, cook them until the white of the

Mafay persons prefer cold, boiled ham for broiling or 
frying. 

HAM BOILED. 

Soak the ham over night, next morning wash it thor- 
oughly, place in kettle with hot water to cover it ; put one 
pint of cider vinegar and two onions into the water; let the 
ham simmer five hours— turn it once. Then take from the 
kettle, remove the skin, sprinkle fine bread crumbs over 
the ham, in which mix one tablespoonful of sugar and one 
tablespoonful of pepper ; bake the ham for one hour, or, in 
place of putting into the oven, the ham can be put back into 
a smaller kettle, and one pint of white wine poured over it 
and the kettle tightly closed and the ham cooked in this 
for one hour. 

LIVINGSTON HAMS. 
For every three hundred weight of hams ; seven 
quarts of fine salt, two pounds of brow^n sugar, one quart 
of molasses, one pound of saltpetre. Rub the hams with 
this mixture once a week until the mixture is exhausted. 
Then change about the hams, putting bottom ones on top, 
etc. Keep in a cool place for two weeks, and then smoke. 

HAM (BAKED). 
One ham, twelve pounds, seven pounds of flour. 
Make the flour into a paste with water, completely cover 
the ham with it ; put into the oven and bake four hours. 
Take the crust off as soon it comes out of the oven ; when 
cold, glaze. 



71 



STEAMED HAM. 



Put the ham in cold water for twelve hours, wash it 
thoroughly, rubbing with a stiff brush to dislodge any salt 
on the outside, put into the steamer, cover closely and put 
over fast boiling w^ater, allowing thirty minutes to each 
pound ; keep the water on the steady boil, skin and 
sprinkle fine crumbs" over the ham, and serve. 

PIG'S HEAD. 

Boil the head including the tongue in a good sized 
sauce-pan with sufficient water to cover the head, add a little 
salt ; when sufficiently cooked the flesh will leave the bones. 
Chop it very fine while hot, add pepper and salt to taste 
and a little chopped sage, if sage is liked ; put into a bowl, 
press it firmly into the bowl and place a weight on top. 
Return the bones to the stock which, when carefully skim- 
med, will serve for a good soup of peas, oatmeal, etc. ; the 
fat to be used for frying. Oatmeal is very good in the soup, 
dredge in the meal, carefully stirring all the while. 

LEG OF PORK ROASTED. 

Take a leg of pork of about seven pounds, roast it, al- 
lowing tw^enty minutes to each pound, baste it frequently 
with the gravy which runs out from the leg ; when done 
place on a platter, pour off the fat in the pan, add a little 
hot water, scrape the pan well ; if the gravy is liked thick- 
ened, add one tablespoonful of flour, one saltspoonful of 
salt and a little pepper. 

STEWED LEG OF PORK— i. 

Take a leg of young pork, rub it well with salt and let 
it lie in the salt for a week. When ready to cook it, place 
it in an iron pot wth just enough water to cover it and let 
it simmer for four hours, skimming off the fat. Then re- 
move the leg of pork, strain the water, put into the pot one 
pint of good vinegar, one-half pound of brown sugar, one 
pint of the water in which the pork was boiled. Put in 
the pork, cover well and place the pot in the oven and let 
it cook for two hours or longer. The pork should be well 
browned. Serve with the gravy in the pot, and apple 
sauce, 



72 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

STEWED LEG OF PORK— 2. 
Put into the kettle one leg of young pork, one carrot 
cut fine, two onions sliced, a bunch of sweet herbs, one 
tablespoonful of butter and water to half cover the leg; 
cover the kettle tightly, and cook the pork for two hours. 
Turn the leg once. When cooked, remove the pork, add a 
little boiling water to the gravy, thicken with one table- 
spoonful of flour, add a little salt and pepper, and pour this 
sauce over the pork and serve. 

PORK MEAT-CAKE. 
Chop some cold pork very fine ; grate two potatoes and 
one onion ; mix with the pork ; add two eggs well beaten, a 
little salt and pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of milk; make 
into a cake and fry in a little fat. Serve hot. 

BONED SPARE-RIBS OF PORK STUFFED. 

Six pounds from the piece of spare-ribs of pork, it con- 
sists of the flat bones cut from the loin ; slip out the bones, 
flatten the meat with chopper, dust it with pepper and then 
spread on it this stuffing : Two well-cooked onions, one 
tablespoonful of dried sage, one pound of chopped apples, 
a little pepper and salt ; mix well together. Roll the meat 
up tightly, fasten at each end with string, place in the oven 
and baste often, it will be cooked in one and one-half hours ; 
dish it very hot— serve with roasted potatoes and a dish of 
good apple sauce. 

SCRAPPLE— I. 

Four pounds of pork, the lower part of belly with skin 
on, one pound of beef liver ; after cleaning pork, boil both 
together with plenty of salt and pepper, cook until tender, 
then chop fine, each separately. Sift into the liquor two 
teacups of cornmeal, let boil until well cooked, add salt, 
pepper and sage to taste, then add pork and liver and one 
cup of buckwheat flour— don't make it thick, pour into 
pans. 

SCRAPPLE— 2. 

Boil together six pig's feet and a jowl, until they rre 
so tender you can pull out all the bones ; then chop the meai 
fine. Put into the liquor when boiling, enough cornmeal 
to thicken the mixture, cook all well together, season with 



PORK. 



"73 



salt and pepper, then add the meat. Put into shallow 
dishes, slice when needed and fry. 

SAUSAGE. 

For forty pounds of meat, thirteen ounces of salt, four 
ounces of pepper, one ounce of sage. Spread the meat out 
on a table, and sprinkle the salt, pepper and sage over it, 
stir well ; then grind the meat very fine, by seasoning 
before grinding every bit is well done. It is wise to make 
the meat up into balls and fry, then pack away. If the 
meat is to be kept, cover well with lard. 

Sausage can be kept for several months, perfectly 
sweet, if after it is prepared, it is made into small balls 
(enough for one person) and fried a little on each side ; then 
pack the balls into a stone crock and pour over the top some 
melted lard. Keep the sausage meat in a cool, dry place. 
When needed, fry the balls in a very little lard. 

BOILED SAUSAGE. 
Put the sausage into boiling water and cook for ten 
minutes ; serve with a turkey or chicken. 

BROILED SAUSAGE. 
Have the broiler hot and greased ; broil the sausage for 
five minut^ ; serve on hot toast. 

FRIED SAUSAGE. 
Have the pan very hot ; put in the sausage, fry for ten 
minutes, turn them once, and serve hot. 

SAUSAGE ROLLS— I. 
Make a light biscuit dough with milk, let it rise over 
night ; in the morning roll it out very thin, cut into biscuits, 
place a sausage in the center of each, fold over the dough ; 
let it rise again, then bake in hot oven. 

SAUSAGE ROLLS— 3. 
Roll out some good pastry, a puff paste is best ; roll out 
to one-eighth of an inch in thickness, then cut the paste in 
five-inch squares ; wet the edges with a little beaten egg ; 
mince up any cold meat with a little ham, season with salt 
and pepper or use sausage meat. On each square spread 
two ounces of the meat, fold, press the ends together, brush 
over the rolls slightly with the egg, and bake in a quick oven 
for fifteen minutes. Send them to the table on a napkin.

POULTRY. 



HOW TO CHOOSE AND PREPARE POULTRY. 

An old test in choosing poultry is the condition of the 
breast bone. Touch the end of it and if it bends easily from 
side to side the bird is under a year old, and tender. If 
not it will serve best in fricassees and stews. The skin of 
the chicken should be firm, smooth and white ; the feet 
short and soft, the legs long, smooth and yellow, the spurs 
small and comb red and fresh, w^hile the eyes are bright and 
full. Pin feathers denote a young chicken, while on fowls 
there are long hairs. The drawing should be done as soon 
as the bird reaches the kitchen. The first step consists in 
removing the pin feathers and hair. This is usually done by 
holding the bird by the head and feet and turning it con- 
tinually over a ilaming newspaper. As there is danger of 
smoking the flesh by this process it is really better to use a 
small quantity of ignited w^ood alcohol. 

Cut off the head, cut the skin down the back of the 
neck and fold it over, while you carefully remove the crop 
and wind pipe, then cut the neck off close, leaving the skin 
to fold back over the opening. 

Next cut a small opening under the rump, run the finger 
around so as to loosen the entrails. Do the same at the 
neck. Carefully draw them out in one solid mass without 
any part being broken ; cut around the vent to free the large 
intestines. If by accident the gall sack or the intestines 
should be broken the inside of the chicken must be washed 
quickly and wiped immediately, otherw^ise the outside treat- 
ment here will suffice. Cut the oil sack away from the 
rump ; cut the gall sack from the liver. 

Cut open the outer coat of the gizzard and draw it away 
from the inner sack, leaving this last unbroken. Open the 
heart and wash free from blood. These inner organs and 
the giblets are to be saved for the gravy. 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 75 

Nothing improves a bird more than the drawing of 
the sinews from the legs. This, if done, is accomplished 
before the entrails are drawn. Bend the leg back slightly 
and carefully cut the skin at the joint just enough 
to expose the sinews; run a skewer in each of them 
in turn and carefully draw them out. After a little practice 
has given skill you can get out as many as eight. The one on 
the back of the leg is the one you should be particularly 
persistent about, since it is so large and strong. In turkeys 
especially these sinews are so tough that in cooking they 
become almost as hard as bones, but if removed the drum- 
stick is as tender as any other part. 

If frozen the fowl should be put into a warm room to 
thaw several hours before needed. Do not soak it to thaw it. 

BREADED SPRING CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken before cooking, season with salt and 
pepper. Take two eggs beaten lightly, put them into one- 
half cup of milk, and stir into this mixture two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour ; dip each piece of chicken into this and after- 
wards into bread crumbs. 

Bake the chicken in an oven on a pan; make a gravy 
of one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
one tablespoonful of butter, boiled together. 

BOUDIN OF CHICKEN AND TRUFFLES. 

Put half a pint of water into a stew-pan with a pinch 
of salt and an ounce of butter ; when it boils stir into it enough 
flour to make a thick paste ; put it by to get cold. Take the 
flesh from a fowl and pound in the mortar, add half its 
bulk of the above paste, and half that quantity again of 
butter, then salt, pepper, a small piece of shallot and a little 
nutmeg. Mix the whole in the mortar and work into 
this mixture one whole egg and the yolks of three. Pass 
the whole through a sieve and work in a gill of cream. 
Take a mold, butter it well (or use several small ones) ; cut 
truffles in slices, stamp them in any shape and arrange them 
against the molds in pretty devices. Half fill the mold or 
molds ; tie a piece of paper on the top ; place in a stew-pan 
half full of water and steam for fifteen to twenty minutes. 
Turn out carefully and serve with truffle or tomato sauce. 



76 THK 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

BROILED SPRING CHICKEN. 

Split the young chicken down the back, remove all the 
entrails, wipe dry, flatten with the rolling pin ; place in the 
oven for five minutes to heat it, then dip the chicken into 
some melted butter, place on the hot gridiron with the in- 
side down ; broil for fifteen minates, turning it once ; when 
cooked, place on a hot platter and spread some butter over 
it with salt and pepper or some maitre d'hotel butter. 

TO PREPARE SPRING CHICKENS. 

Young spring chickens are often dry ; dip them in 
melted butter or olive oil before broiling them." It is a very 
good plan to place the chickens in a hot oven for ten min- 
utes before you put them on to broil. 

CHICKEN AU CASSEROLE— I. 

Put about one and one-half ounces of butter into a fire- 
proof casserole with two ounces or so of fat bacon cut up into 
dice, a pinch of salt, a sliced onion, or two or three shallots 
and a sliced carrot ; let all this brown gently, and when 
quite hot lay in the fowl dressed as for roasting ; let it color 
till of a pale golden color on both sides, then pour into the 
pan half a pint or so of good stock ; cover down very closely 
and let it stew gently in the oven till done, and either serve 
neatly dished on a hot dish, or better in the pan in which 
it was cooked. This is the simple form of "poulet au cass- 
erole," but needless to say, it can be made richer in a 
variety of ways, adding a tablespoonful of sherry or a sherry 
glassful of chablis to the stock ; or rich, strong gravy, 
put in with the fowls, truffles, mushrooms, tiny silver or 
pickling onions, some small slices of ham, or some of the 
small French sausages,— these can all cook with the fowl as 
before. 

Almost any meat can be cooked in this way. Beef- 
steak cut up and stewed thus, with half stock, half red wine 
and silver onions is particularly good. 

CHICKEN AU CASSEROLE-2. 

Put a small spring chicken into the casserole with 
a little water, one tablespoonful of butter and some 
potatoes cut into round balls with the vegetable cutter. 



POULTRY — CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 77 

Place in the oven and cook thirty minutes, then add one 
can of mushrooms, a flat tablespoonful of chopped onion, 
one-half a wine glass of extract of beef or one-half cup of 
rich stock, one-half a wine glass of sherry, a little salt and 
pepper, and thicken the gravy with one tablespoonful of 
flour ; to do this, push the chicken on one side, return to 
the oven and cook for five minutes and serve at once. If the 
chicken is old, parboil or steam it for one hour, then put in 
the casserole and cook as for spring chicken. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES— I. 
Boil one chicken and two sweet breads ; when cold chop 
them fine. Take one, tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour ; fry together ; then add one-half pint of 
cream, a iew drops of onion juice, add the chicken and 
sweet bread ; stir well together, add salt, mace and cayenne. 
Spread the mixture thinly on a platter ; when cold shape 
into croquettes, dip each into beaten egg, then into bread 
crumbs or cracker crumbs ; have the fat boiling hot and 
deep ; before frying put the croquettes on the ice for two 
hours. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES— 2. 
(Washington.) 

Take two chickens, boil them in a little water until 
tender. Two sets of brains, prepared as " brains, to cook." 
When the chickens are cold remove the meat and chop it 
very fine ; one teacupful of suet chopped fine, two sprigs 
of parsley minced as fine as possible, the juice and rind of 
one lemon, one nutmeg, one tablespoonful of finely chopped 
onion, one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. 
Mix the^e all well together and add enough cream to make 
the mixture very moist ; have it as soft as possible and be able 
to mold it. Make the mixture into croquettes, either with 
a mold or with the hands ; dip them into beaten egg, then 
into fine cracker crumbs ; fry them in deep, hot fat or lard. 
This quantity should make twenty-four croquettes. 

Cold veal or lamb can be used in the same manner. 

CURRY OF CHICKEN. 
One good-sized, young chicken, two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, two onions sliced, one small, even tablespoonful of 



>j8 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

grated cocoanut, one-half an apple cut fine, one pint of 
stock, one tablespoonful of curry powder, one tablespoonful 
of flour, four tablespoonfuls of cream, one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice ; cut the chicken into pieces, fry the onions, 
cocoanut and apple in the butter ; when fried add the stock 
and stew gently for fifteen minutes, then add the curry 
powder and flour rubbed together with a little stock ; stew 
for fifteen minutes, then add the cream, which should be 
hot, and lastly the lemon juice. 

DEVILED CHICKEN. 

Take any cold, cooked chicken and cut into small 
pieces ; dip them into a little melted butter, then into a 
paste made of one teaspoonful of French mustard, one-half 
teaspoonful of English mustard, one teaspoonful of Worces- 
tershire sauce, one-half saltspoonful of cayenne, one salt- 
spoonful of salt. Then place the pieces of chicken in a dish, 
cover them with fine bread crumbs and a few bits of butter, 
and bake for fifteen minutes. Turn the chicken on to a hot 
plate, garnish with some watercress seasoned with salt and 
pepper and a little oil and vinegar. 

Any cold game or poultry can be deviled in the same 
way. 

ESCALLOPED CHICKEN. 
Boil two chickens until they are tender ; when cool pick 
the meat from the bones and cut into small pieces. Butter 
a pudding dish, put in one layer of chicken, then a layer of 
sauce made of one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, 
one tablespoonful of flour cooked together. Put the butter 
that has been heated into a saucepan; stir in the flour ; 
when smooth add the cream, a little salt, pepper and 
powdered mace ; fill the dish with alternate layers of chicken 
and sauce ; on top put some very fine bread crumbs in which 
one tablespoonful of butter has been rubbed. Bake one- 
half hour. Serve in the dish it was baked in. 

BONES FOR SOUP. 
Return the bones to the water in which the chickens 
were boiled ; boil together one hour and strain, and when 
cold take off the fat. This will make a good broth, or a 
good foundation for a white soup. 



POULTRY CHICKBN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 79 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN. 
Take one chicken weighing about three pounds, cut it 
into pieces neatly ; let these stand in cold water for a half 
hour, then drain and put them into the stew-pan with one 
quart of water, one onion with two cloves stuck in it, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonfulof pepper, one-half 
pound of salt pork cut in small pieces ; boil, skim and then 
place the saucepan on the back of the stove for two hours, 
then remove the chicken ; take out the onion ; stir together 
one tablespoonful of flour and one tablespoonful of butter 
and one tablespoonful of cream ; stir this into the broth ; 
when the broth thickens pour it over the chicken and serve. 

VIRGINIA FRIED CHICKEN. 
Cut the chicken into pieces, dip each piece into flour 
wnich has been well seasoned with pepper- 
Take slices of salt pork, put them on the frying pan 
and cook until the fat is all extracted ; remove the pork and 
fry the chicken in the fat ; fry slowly for twenty minutes if 
the chickens are quite young — rather longer if they are old, 
Then remove the chickens, arrange neatly on a platter and 
keep warm while you make the gravy ; stir into the fat one 
cup of milk (of course, cream is better) in which you have 
mixed a tablespoonful of flour ; as soon as it thickens, pour 
over the chickens. 

HUNGARIAN CHICKEN OR PAPRIKA HULM. 
Take one large tablespoonful of butter, put into the 
stew-pan ; add two onions sliced fine ; when they are of a 
light brown color add one-half teaspoonful of paprika ; let 
the onions brown a few minutes longer, then add the 
chicken cut into pieces and one-half teaspoonful of salt ; 
brown the chicken ; when this is done add one pint of good 
stock or boiling water ; stew very gently with the pan 
closely covered until the chicken is cooked ; remove from 
the pan, put on a hot dish ; add to the gravy one teacup of 
rich sour cream ; let this scald only in the gravy and then 
strain the gravy over the chicken. 

CHICKEN HASH. 
Mince cold roasted or boiled chicken, not too fine. To 
each cupful of meat add two tablespoonfuls of butter, one- 



80 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

half a cup of milk, one minced onion, one teaspoonful of salt, 
a little pepper. Mix well together, cook, and stir frequently. 
Serve on toast with a garnish of parsley. 

CHICKEN HASH WITH EGGS. 
Prepare as above, but just before serving poach as many 
eggs as required and place on the hash. 

CHICKEN HASH ON RICE TOAST. 

The night before, prepare some boiled rice and set away 
in a dish, with a weight on top. The next morning cut it in 
slices one-half an inch thick ; brush over with melted butter, 
lay between a double broiler and toast a delicate brown ; 
put bits of butter on each, season w^ith salt and pepper, 
squeeze over a few drops of orange or lemon juice ; hash 
the chicken, heat in brown or cream sauce and place it on 
the rice. 

CHICKEN JELLY. 

Cut up one-half an old chicken, one calf's foot and one- 
half pound of veal ; put in soup-kettle with three pints of 
cold water, one-half teaspoonful of salt ; boil and then skim 
carefully ; add one tablespoonful of chopped carrots, one 
tablespoonful of onions chopped fine, one-half tablespoonful 
of blanched almonds. Simmer the broth until all the meat 
is tender; skim again, and then strain the broth through a 
fine sieve or napkin ; if desired very clear, after straining, 
add the white of an egg beaten very light ; stir this into the 
broth and let it boil up, then remove and strain again. Put 
into small molds or cups and place on the ice. 

JELLIED CHICKEN— I. 
Boil one chicken ; when cold cut the meat into small 
pieces ; place in the mold a layer of the chicken seasoned 
with salt and pepper, then a layer of a few capers or truffles, 
then the chicken ; press all down to make it solid. When 
the mold is full, pour over the water in which the chicken 
was boiled, in which you have put one tablespoonful of but- 
ter. Cover and place in the ice-chest for a few hours. 

JELLIED CHICKEN-2. 
Cut up a good-sized chicken, leave the breast whole ; 
put all into a stew-pan including the liver, gizzard and

heart, put over it one quart of cold water and let it come to 
the boiling point slowly, skim and add one bay leaf, four 
cloves, one sprig of thyme, three sprigs of parsley, three 
slices of lemon ; simmer for one hour ; do not let it boil, or 
the meat will be tough ; cut off the meat in small pieces, 
excepting the breast, cut this in four long strips ; put back 
the bones into the pan -with one-half an ounce of gelatine 
which must be previously soaked in a little cold water. Let 
the bones stew a little longer, then strain through a napkin ; 
take the jelly mold, pour into it a little of the gravy; let 
it harden ; cut one hard-boiled egg into slices, place these 
in the jelly ; slice the liver and put them over the eggs and 
the breast ; pour over some of the jelly, then when it is 
hard put in the meat and pour over the balance of the jelly. 
Remains of cold turkey or game can be made into a 
jellied dish ; their bones stew^ed down for the gravy, and if 
liked, some lean ham can be chopped fine and added. 

JELLIED CHICKEN— 3. 

Jellied chicken is a delicious cold dish to serve with 
cresses or lettuce. Cut a fowl into four parts and cover 
them with boiling water; add a stalk of celery, one 
slice each of carrot and onion, a bay leaf, a couple of 
cloves and half a dozen of peppercorns. Cover the kettle 
and let the liquid slowly simmer over the fire until the fowl 
is tender. Remove the chicken and let the liquid become 
cold ; then take off all the fat and reheat the liquid. 
Season it with salt and a little cayenne pepper, and then 
add half an ounce of gelatine that has been soaked in a 
little cold water an hour or more, and stir until it is entirely 
dissolved ; then strain the liquid into an earthern bowl. Free 
the chicken from skin and bone and cut it into moderate 
sized pieces. Wet a plain mold with cold water and lay upon 
the bottom and sides some slices of hard-boiled eggs ; then 
put in the prepared fowl and some shreds of cold boiled 
ham or tongue scattered among the chicken ; very thin 
slices of cucumber pickles are also frequently added. Pour 
over the whole the liquid jelly and place the mold in a cool 
place to harden. Turn it out upon a platter and garnish 
with cresses or salad leaves. 



82 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CHICKEN LIVER WITH BACON. 

Take the livers, roll them in melted butter, then in fine 
bread crumbs ; season with salt, pepper and a little cayenne. 
Broil them for five minutes, first flattening them a little. 
When cooked, serve in a hot dish with a maitre d'hotel 
butter, and garnish with crisp slices of bacon. 

Broiled squabs, quail, grouse and woodcock are 
properly served with garnish of bacon. 

CHICKEN A LA MARENGO. 

Prepare the chicken as for fricassee ; put the pieces 
into a stew-pan with one tablespoonful of olive oil, two 
shallots, one teaspoonful of salt, one bay leaf, one-half tea- 
spoonful of pepper, one garlic clove, one bunch of parsley, 
one sprig of thyme, fry these together for tM^enty-five 
minutes, or until the chicken is tender, then take from the 
pan and keep hot. Take one tablespoonful of flour, mix it 
with a little cold water, stir it into the broth, cook for ten 
minutes, then drain over the chicken and serve ; do not 
skim the broth. 

CHICKEN PATTIES. 
Cut in very small pieces the breast of a cooked chicken. 
Put in the stew-pan one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour ; stir together ; when smooth add one 
tablespoonful of cream, a little nutmeg, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a little cayenne, then add the chicken. Do not 
let the mixture brown ; fill the patty-cases and bake. 

CHICKEN PIE— I. 
Cut in pieces a good-sized chicken, pull off all the skin 
you can; cook the chicken in the stew pan with a pint of 
water, one slice of lean ham, one onion, four peppercorns, 
one-fourth pound of salt pork cut in pieces, until tender ; 
then remove the chicken and the pork, place the pieces in 
a deep pudding dish. Rub together one tablespoonful of 
flour, and one tablespoonful of butter, stir this into the 
liquor in which thechicken was cooked, add one-half cupful 
of cream or milk or more ; when the gravy is thickened and 
smooth, strain into the dish with the chicken. Cover the 
dish with pastry and bake until the pastry is done— one-half 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 83 

an hour is generally the time required. Make the pastry 
either with suet or butter. 

Veal pie can be made in the same manner, only sub- 
stituting veal for chicken, and leaving out the salt pork. 

CHICKEN PIE— 2. 
Cut into pieces two chickens, put them into a kettle 
and cover with water ; add one saltspoonful of salt and one- 
fourth saltspoonful of pepper. Simmer the chickens until 
they are tender, then remove from the fire, take from the 
kettle, leaving the gravy in the kettle, and put the pieces 
into a deep dish which has been buttered. Make a batter 
with one pint of sweet milk and two eggs well beaten and 
enough flour to make the batter the consistency of thick 
cream; add one pinch of salt, season the chicken with a 
little salt and pepper and add one tablespoonful of butter; 
pour over the batter and bake one-half hour. Thicken the 
gravy with one tablespoonful of flour, rubbed smooth with 
a little milk, and boil for five minutes. Serve it in a gravy 
boat w^ith the pie. 

CHICKEN POt-PIE. 
Cut a chicken into pieces, put it into the stew-pan with 
water enough to cover the pieces, one-half pound of salt 
pork cut in pieces, one saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper; 
let the chicken simmer slowly ; when it is nearly done, put 
in the dumplings, made the same as soda biscuits, cover the 
pan and let them cook for one-half hour. Put the pieces of 
chicken in the center of the platter, the dumplings around 
them. Thicken the gravy with one tablespoonful of flour 
mixed with one tablespoonful of butter, add two tablespoon- 
fuls of cream or milk ; strain the gravy over the chicken and 
serve. 

CHICKEN WITH POACHED EGGS. 
A nest made of bits of cooked chicken for serving 
poached eggs in, is a tempting way to use up the ragged 
pieces. Chop the meat very fine, and for two cups of meat 
add one tablespoonful of melted butter, the same quantity 
of cream, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a little 
salt and cayenne pepper, and two beaten eggs. Put the 
ingredients in a saucepan and let them thoroughly heat so 



84 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

as to set the eggs. Turn the mixture on a hot platter and 
form it in a flat mold with a ridge around the edge. Mean- 
while poach the eggs required and place them carefully on 
the meat. Garnish the dish with parsley and slices of hard- 
boiled eggs around the mold. 

ROASTING TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 
Before roasting either a turkey or chicken, after it is 
stuffed, pound it well all over with the rolling-pin ; the 
pounding renders the fowl tender and plump ; then spread 
the fowl all over with butter and flour mixed to a smooth 
paste ; this mixture is the greatest possible improvement. 
Another way is to blanket the fowl all over with thin slices 
of salt pork ; use the dry salt pork always for larding or for 
blanketing. It is far better than pickled pork for this pur- 
pose. If the chicken is very fat, bind over the breast the 
chicken fat. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 
A chicken a year old is generally used for roasting ; if 
an older fowl is used, steam it for one hour before roasting. 
Have the chicken nicely prepared ; it can be stuffed or not ; 
draw the drum sticks together, tie them ; blanket the chicken 
with thin slices of salt pork ; baste frequently in the oven ; 
allow fifteen minutes for each pound ; just before the chicken 
is ready, rub some butter over the breast and legs with some 
salt and pepper. Serve with a gravy made of the giblets. 

SWEDISH CHICKEN. 
Young spring chickens are the nicest for this preparation, 
though chickens a year old can be used. Have the chickens 
left whole ; clean them. Take one-fourth pound of butter 
and one large bunch of parsley— take the leaves only— chop 
them fine and mix with the butter and a little salt ; fill the 
chickens with this mixture. Put into the braising-pot (an 
iron pot with a closely-fitting iron lid), two tablespoonfuls 
of butter ; brown the chickens in this ; then put the pot on 
the back of the stove ; add one pint of cream to the chickens ; 
cover the pot and let the chickens simmer, not boil, for one 
and one-half hours if young ones are used ; two hours if 
older. Cook the giblets with the chickens. When ready 
to serve remove the chickens and thicken the gravy with 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 85 

one tablespoonful of flour ; strain this gravy and serve with 
the fowls. 

CHICKEN STEWED. 
For one chicken weighing three pounds, take one table- 
spoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of flour, one large 
onion cut fine, three slices of carrot, three slices of turnip, 
three pints of boiling water, onesaltspoonful of salt, one-half 
saltspoonful of pepper. Wash the chicken, put it into a 
large stew-pan and let it boil gently, put the carrot, turnip, 
and onion with the butter in a saucepan and cook slowly 
for one half hour, stirring them often; skim off two table- 
spoonfuls of the fat from the chicken, remove the vegetables 
from the saucepan, put in the fat, add the flour and stir 
until a dark brown ; mash the vegetables through a sieve 
into the stew-pan with the chicken, stir in the brown sauce, 
and let all simmer together until the chicken is cooked. A 
year-old chicken will require two hours. Twelve minutes 
before serving let all boil once. Serve with boiled bacon, 
ham or sausage. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES. 
Cook the chicken until the meat will fall from the 
bones, season as it is being cooked with salt, pepper and a 
small onion and a little mace. Remove the meat, strain 
the gravy, then put the chicken back on the fire ; add cream, 
about one pint, and a good piece of butter, unless the chicken 
is very fat. Boil the gravy, then set away to cool ; when 
the meat is cold cut it very fine, add the gizzard and liver 
cut very fine. Cut the bread thin, spread it with layer of 
meat, then layer of gravy ; roll the bread, and fasten with 
little wooden toothpicks. 

CHICKEN SOUFFLES. 

Take the breast of a chicken, pound it well in the mor- 
tar, press it through a sieve ; to two tablespoonfuls of the 
meat, after it is pounded, add the yolks of two eggs, two 
truffles cut fine, a saltspoonful of salt, a little cayenne and 
a little nutmeg ; mix these well together and add to the mix- 
ture one-fourth pint of whipped cream, and the well-beaten 
whites of three eggs. 

Fill little piaper cases, which can be purchased at the 



86 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

confectioners, two-thirds full with the mixture and bake in 
a moderate oven for fifteen minutes ; then serve on a napkin 
on a dish. Tomato or cream sauce can be served with the 
soufHe if wished. 

TIMBALES OF CHICKEN. 
To every pound of the breast of an uncooked chicken 
pounded to a smooth paste, add one cup of bread crumbs 
and one-half cup of milk ; cooked together, and add 
this gradually to the chicken meat ; add one teaspoonful 
of salt, a little cayenne and a little nutmeg, then add 
the well-beaten whites of five eggs — put them in very 
gently. Grease the timbale molds or tins, sprinkle on the 
bottom of each a little finely chopped truffle ; steam the tim- 
bales. Be careful not to let any water boil into the tins, by 
covering them with white paper, Steam for twenty min- 
utes and serve with white sauce. 

ROAST GOOSE— I. 

Prepare the goose for roasting, then stuff it with the 
following preparation : Peel, wash and dry a platefuU of 
potatoes ; cut them into small dice. Put into the stew-pan 
one and one-half tablespoonfuls of butter ; when hot put in 
the potatoes, one onion minced fine, one garlic clove minced; 
cover the pan ; shake the potatoes to prevent burning, 
steam them until they are half cooked, then take from the 
fire and stir with them the liver of the goose, cut very fine ; 
one saltspoonful of salt, one-fourth saltspoonful of pepper, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of powdered sage, one grate of nut- 
meg ; stuff ; or in place of this stuffing use apples cut into 
small pieces and make a rich gravy with the giblets. 
Prunes half stewed, make a very good stuffing ; almonds 
chopped fine and mixed with apples and bread crumbs can 
be used also, 

ROAST GOOSE— 2. 
Take a young, fat goose, chop two onions fine and fry 
them for five minutes in a little butter; mix the onions with 
one pint of mashed potato, one-half teaspoonful of sage, 
one teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper ; stuff the goose 
with this. Roast the goose for two hours, basting fre- 
quently with butter- water. 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 87 

Cut six large apples into halves, fill a baking- pan with 
them, put over them little bits of butter and some powdered 
sugar ; bake until they are soft, then place them around the 
goose and serve. 

Make a gravy by boiling the giblets in one-half pint of 
water. When they are done, chop the gizzard fine, rub the 
liver with one tablespoonful of flour and one-half spoonful 
of butter ; stir this into the water in which the giblets were 
boiled until it thickens. Or stuff your goose with apples 
and add two ounces sultana raisins. 

TO RENDER DOWN GOOSE FAT. 

Take all the fat that was removed from the inside of 
the bird when drawing it, or any other superfluous pieces. 
Put all into cold water and leave one day. Change the 
water once or tw^ice. Then drain off the water and cut the 
fat into small pieces, put into a clean stew pan, and slowly 
melt it till nothing but skinny pieces remain and liquid fat. 
Strain it into a jar through a piece of unbleached calico or 
muslin ; when cold cover tightly and keep in a cool place. 

ROAST TAME DUCK. 

The ducks may be stuffed with mashed potatoes and 
onions, with a little sage added or with apples chopped 
fine and seasoned with salt and pepper. Baste the ducks 
very often while roasting. If large, one hour and a half is 
necessary to properly roast them ; ordinary sized ducks, 
about one hour. Serve with a gravy made from the giblets. 

STEAMED DUCK. 
Rub the duck with warm butter ; put into the oven to 
acquire a slightly yellow color ; then put into the stew-pan 
with one carrot sliced, one celery root or three stalks, one 
onion, three cloves, one bay leaf, two sage leaves, one pint 
of water ; lay the duck on these, the breast upward, let it 
steam, closely covered until the vegetables are cooked ; add 
one saltspoonful of salt, and more water if it is needed. 
When the duck is cooked remove from the pan, skim the 
gravy, strain through a sieve, then return it to the pan and 
thicken with one tablespoonful of flour; boil once and 
serve with the duck. 



88 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CREAMED TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 
Chop fine one quart of cold boiled turkey or chicken ; 
take one pint of fresh white bread crumbs, without crusts ; 
add one-half pint of rich milk and cook together until soft. 
Be sure to stir the mixture constantly that it may not burn. 
When cooked add the turkey or chicken meat, seasoned 
with salt and pepper and a little celery salt. Beat the 
yolks of four eggs until light, add to the preparation, then 
stir in the whites, beaten a little, not too frothy, just 
broken. Butter a mold, put in the mixture and place the 
mold in a pan half full of hot water and bake twenty 
minutes. Turn the mixture from the mold and serve either 
hot or cold ; if hot, serve a white sauce with mushrooms 
added. Serve green peas with the dish. 

BROILED TURKEY. 
For broiling, only a young, half grown turkey is used. 
Split in half, broil over a clear fire for twenty minutes; 
serve with melted butter, salt and pepper. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Clean, rub with salt, pepper and lemon juice, and stuff 
with oyster or bread stuffing. Really the turkey is better 
without the stuffing, and an oyster sauce is nicer. Crush 
the wings and legs close to the body, pin the fowl in a 
clean cloth, put a little salt in the water, cook slowly, allow- 
ing twenty minutes for each pound. A turkey is nicer 
steamed than boiled, serve with oyster or celery sauce. 

A boiled turkey can be stuffed with celery seasoned 
with salt and pepper or with macaroni, which has been 
partially cooked before using in the fowl. 

BREAST OF TURKEY BROILED. 
Cut each breast off cleanly in one piece, dip into 
melted butter, broil fifteen minutes. Every five minutes 
dip again in melted butter seasoned with salt and pepper ; 
serve with some of the butter poured over each piece. This 
way of cooking a turkey will make it very delicious. 

ROAST TURKEY. 
Stuff the turkey with bread crumbs seasoned with salt 
and pepper, one tablespoonful of powered thyme and one- 



POULTRY CHICKEN, GOOSE, DUCK, AND TURKEY. 89 

half cup of melted butter ; mix well together. Rub the 
turkey well with butter and dredge with flour and a little 
salt ; put in hot oven ; as soon as it is brown reduce the 
heat of the oven, put one pint of hot water and one table- 
spoonful of butter into the pan, and baste with this every 
few minutes, dredging with flour often. 

If chestnut stuffing is desired take one quart of large 
chestnuts, pour Over them boiling water to soften the shells, 
remove the shells and the brown skin, boil in salted water 
until tender, mash them (keep a portion for the gravy), add 
to the chestnuts one cup of rolled cracker crumbs, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, one-half cup of melted butter. 
For the gravy remove all the fat from the baking pan, add 
one pint of boiling water, stir in one tablespoonful of flour 
which has been rubbed into one tablespoonful of butter, 
add a little salt and pepper and the remainder of the chest- 
nuts. 

STEWED TURKEY. 
Cut the turkey into nice pieces, put on to cook with 
one quart of water, a few pieces of salt pork, one onion, 
one teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper ; stew gently for 
one and one half hours. Remove the pieces of turkey, 
thicken the gravy with two tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed 
with one tablespoonful of butter. 

MINCED TURKEY. 
Chop very fine the remains of cold turkey. To each 
cupful of meat, add one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of milk or cream, one teaspoonful of flour dissolved 
in the milk, a saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper; let the 
preparation boil once ; put it upon toasted bread and place 
poached eggs on the top if desired. 

STUFFING FOR TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 
Bread crumbs grated fine put into the roasting pan ; 
add salt and pepper and a good large lump of butter ; brown 
on the top of the stove, stirring all the time, then stuff the 
fowl ; the stuffing will be found to be very light and diges- 
tible. Place the fowl in the same pan without washing 
the pan. 



90 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

STUFFING FOR ROAST TURKEY. 

Substitute pork sausage meat for the suet, add one- 
fourth pound of chopped Sultana raisins. 

TO COOK A TURKEY. 

Three hours will cook a ten pound turkey ; it is well to 
have the oven hot at first, then a slower one ; baste fre- 
quently with butter-water. 

BREAD CUPS. 

To fill with creamed sweetbreads, chicken, veal, beef, 
etc. 

Cut slices of bread six inches thick ; cut with a deep 
cutter. A half-pound baking tin is nice for this purpose. 
Fry these cups in hot lard until brown then remove the cen- 
ters It is well to make a round mark on the tops of the 
cups before frying. FU the cups with any of the above 
preparations. Serve at once. 



GAME. 



91 



GAME. 

BROILED CANVAS BACK DUCK. 
Clean as for roasting; split the duck on the back, 
season with salt and pepper and spread over it some olive 
oil ; put on the hot gridiron ; cook over a very hot fire for 
fifteen minutes, then put on a hot dish ; pour over the duck 
melted butter, one tablespoonful of lemon juice, salt and 
pepper. 

BROILED WILD DUCKS. 
Pick, singe and draw the ducks, slit them down the 
back, crack the bones, flatten the ducks with a cleaver, 
season with a little salt and pepper. Have the gridiron 
hot and greased with a little fat ; have the fire clear — a char- 
coal fire is the best for broiling. Broil for ten mihutes. 
Serve very hot with a little butter over them. 

ROAST WILD DUCK (AN OLD VIRGINIA RECIPE). 
Mince the livers of a pair of wild ducks with a table- 
spoonful of scraped bacon ; mix with an ounce of butter a 
slice of onion chopped fine, a little salt and cayenne ; fill 
the bodies of the ducks with the mixture ; lay them in a 
baking pan, cover with thin slices of fat bacon, wrap in let- 
ter paper and set in a hot oven. When the ducks are brown 
take them out, garnish with slices of orange and pour over 
them a sauce made by adding the juice of an orange, two 
minced onions, with a teaspoonful of butter, a pinch of 
cayenne, add a little salt to the gravy in the pan. Twenty 
minutes will cook the ducks. 

ROAST DUCK. 
Do not stuff the duck ; have oven very hot and roast 
just twenty minutes, to be in perfection ; the blood should 
follow the knife in carving. Be sure to serve very hot, and 
baste often with melted butter while roasting. 



92 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

GUINEA FOWL. 
One guinea fowl ; truss and lard it, roast exactly like 
a pheasant. Put a buttered paper over the breast to prevent 
it getting dry. Cook one hour. Serve with bread sauce. 

GROUSE ROASTED. 
When cleaned put a small piece of butter in each grouse, 
cover them well with slices of salt pork, place in your 
dripping-pan some slices of toast and place each bird on a 
piece ; baste the grouse well with butter-water (melted 
butter and water, a tablespoonful of each). Roast for thirty 
minutes. Serve on hot platter with the toast.

OYSTER SAUCE. 
Take half a pint of melted butter (see " Melted 
Butter"), and put it into the liquor of the oysters, in 
which liquor the beards of the oysters should be scalded 
and then strained, add a few drops of essence of anchovy, 
a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and a dash of cayenne ; boil 
up, and then put in the oysters cooked, but cut in half. A 
tablespoonful of cream is a great improvement.

CHICKEN SALAD. 
Boil one chicken until tender. Put in the water one 
onion. When the chicken is cold, cut into small square 
pieces— the salad made of only the white meat is considered 
the finest, but if economy is studied, the dark meat is equally 
good, and the salad liked by many more than when made 
with the white meat alone. Take celery, cut it in small 
pieces, add an equal quantity of the chicken— make a mayon- 
naise dressing— mix carefully with the chicken and celery ; 
garnish with lettuce leaves or with the celery leaves. The 
water in which the chicken was boiled should be saved for 
soup. A medium-sized chicken boiled will make enough 
salad for six people.

spoonful of cayenne, one saltspoonful of mustard, one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Mix all well together and then add slowly 
four tablespoonfuls of hot cider vinegar. Put the mixture 
into the double boiler and let it cook until thick ; be careful 
it does not curdle ; use when cold on raw cabbage, lettuce 
or tomatoes, anli on cooked cauliflower, beans and potatoes.

arrange on lettuce leaves or in a salad dish ; the salad can 
be garnished with slices of hard boiled eggs. Serve very 
cold. 

POTATO SALAD— I.

one tablespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
half teaspoonful of pepper. Let the dressing stand on the 
potatoes for half an hour before serving. 

POTATO SALAD-2. 
Boil the potatoes in their skins, but be careful not to 
cook them until they break open ; when cooked let them 
become cold before cutting them into small pieces ; add

mixture into a bottle and use one tablespoonful for French 
salad dressing with the olive oil. 



I20 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 



VEGETABLES. 



Fresh vegetable, especially of the cabbage tribe, should 
be put into fast boiling water ; salt should be added only 
towards the end of the cooking, as its earlier application 
would simply tend to harden the vegetables. 

Potatoes should always be put into boiling water. Do 
not peel potatoes and let them soak for an indefinite time in 
cold water. Never boil potatoes to be served plain before 
you need them ; never try them with a fork ; the fork causes 
them to break and crumble. 

All green vegetables should be cooked in soft water ; 
add a small bit of soda to preserve the green color. Never 
cover green vegetables. 

Garlic is a most excellent condiment. 

Always put vegetables into boiling water ; never have 
the vegetables wait for the meat. 

ASPARAGUS. 
Asparagus of the large or giant variety should be cut 
of exactly equal lengths and boiled standing tops upward in 
a deep saucepan ; nearly two inches of the heads should be 
out of the water, the steam sufficing to cook them, as they 
are the tenderest part of the plant. The stalks can be 
boiled by this method thirty or forty minutes, thus ensuring 
a third more of the asparagus delicious. 

ASPARAGUS CREAMED. 
Cut off the heads of the asparagus ; cook them in 
slightly salted water ; when tender, which will be in about 
twenty minutes, drain off the water and add one cup of 
cream, one-half tablespoonful of butter, one saltspoonful of 
salt, and a little pepper; as soon as the cream is hot, serve 
the asparagus on slices of toast. 



VEGETABLES. 121 

GLOBE ARTICHOKES. 
The ordinary manner of cooking green artichokes is to 
boil them in water ; when tender, drain them and dish them, 
and send melted butter or cream sauce to be eaten with them. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES STEWED. 
Wash the artichokes, cut off the end of each quite flat. 
Boil them in milk and water and lift them out the moment 
they are done ; drain and place them in the dish in which 
they are to be served, and serve them with a rich bechamel 
sauce. 

BEETS. 

Wash free from dirt, but never peel them before cook- 
ing. Be careful not to break the skin for if broken the 
beets will bleed. Cook young beets about thirty minutes, 
old beets until they are tender. When cooked peel off the 
skin, slice the beets in thin slices or chop fine, put over 
some melted butter, a little salt and pepper and if liked, 
one tablespoonful of hot vinegar. 

BAKED BANANAS. 
Peel the bananas, place them in a tin pan with three 
teaspoonfuls of cold water and one half teaspoonful of but- 
ter, drop a little lemon juice over each banana, dredge them 
with cinnamon and sugar ; bake for fifteen minutes, or until 
they are easily pierced with a fork. Serve at once. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 
Two quarts of Brussels sprouts, wash them thoroughly, 
put them into three quarts of boiling water with one table^ 
spoonful of salt ; boil them gently until they are tender — 
this will be in twenty minutes, shake the pan occasionally, 
then drain them, do not break them; return to the sauce- 
pan, add one-half tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful 
of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of salt, one-fourth saltspoonful 
of pepper ; stir over the fire until hot, then serve on hot, 
buttered toast.

pan, putting them into boiling water, do not cover the pan, 
add a. pinch of soda ; when the beans are tender, drain, put 
back into the saucepan, add one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoonful of cream, salt and pepper. 

LIMA BEANS— I. 
Boil the beans in water ; when nearly done let the water 
simmer away, add one cup of cream or milk, with one table- 
spoonful of flour and two tablespoonfuls of butter mixed 
together. 

LIMA BEANS— 2. 
Boil one pint of lima beans for one hour, then drain 
them, season with a little salt ; keep them hot. Make a 
sauce with one egg beaten light with two tablespoonfuls of 
cold water, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice ; add one table- 
spoonful of butter ; boil these together until the sauce 
thickens, then pour it over the beans and serve hot. 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS. 
Wash the beans and soak them over night in cold 
water ; in the morning put them into cold water and boil 
until soft, then put them into the bean pot with the same 
water, some pepper, one pound of salt pork to one quart of 
beans, one-half cup of molasses. Bake all day ; if the water 
bakes out add more. 

BAKED CABBAGE. 
Put the cabbage into boiling water until the leaves open 
out ; clean. Take two slices of boiled ham, chop it very 
fine with a few leaves of the cabbage, add three hard boiled 
eggs, chopped fine, one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful 
of pepper, one teaspoonful of mustard, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter ; mix these together, remove the heart of the 
cabbage and fill in its place the above mixture. Tie up the 
cabbage and put it into boiling water and cook until tender; 
when cooked remove the cloth, put the cabbage on a pan, 
sprinkle over a little flour and one spoonful of melted lard, 
put into the oven and bake until brown. Serve with a 
sauce poured over it ; for the sauce, take one tablespoonful 
of butter, melt it in the saucepan, when hot stir in one table- 
spoonful of flour ; as soon as the sauce thickens add two 



VEGETABLES. 1 23 

tablespoonfuls of hot milk ; stir well and pour over the cab- 
bage and then put slices of hard boiled eggs over all. 

BOILED CABBAGE. 

Wash and quarter the cabbage not quite into four 
pieces ; keep it so it will not fall apart. Then have four 
quarts of boiling water and add to it one-half teaspoonful 
of soda, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, boil the cabbage in 
this with the cover on ten minutes, then remove the cover 
and boil twenty minutes. Serve with a sauce as for cauli- 
flower. Cabbage cooked exactly as in this recipe, will be 
found digestible, and there will be no odor in the house from 
the cooking of it. 

CABBAGE WITH BUTTER.

cardoons boiled. 

Cut away the coarse outside of the cardoon, wash it 
free from sand, lay in cold water to harden ; then boil 
in milk and water till tender, drain it on the back of a sieve. 
Cut each stalk in two ; place them in a vegetable dish and 
pour white sauce over them. 

CARROTS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. 
Scrape, wash and scald the carrots in boiling water ; 
cook them in hot water, with salt and a piece of butter the

Wash the carrots very clean, scrape them and cut in 
thick slices, put them in boiling water slightly salted, just 
enough to cover them, boil gently until tender, then boil them 
rapidly to reduce the water; when only about one table- 
spoonful is left, put with the carrots one-half tablespoonful 
of butter rolled in flour, a little salt and pepper, stir for a

fold over the napkin and serve at once. 



VBGETABLES. I25 

CREAMED CORN. 
Cut the corn from the cob, cut only the outer part of the 
grain, then scrape the cob clean ; cook the first part in a little 
milk for forty minutes, add the part scraped from the cob, 
and cook together for five minutes ; season with one table- 
spoonful of butter, a little salt and pepper. 

GREEN CORN CAKE. 
Cut the grains from the corn cob, then scrape the cob 
well, add one tablespoonful of melted butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour, salt and pepper. Have the frying pan 
hot and lightly greased with butter, pile the corn on it, 
brown, then turn it over and brown the other side. 

GREEN CORN CAKES. 
Grate the corn, scrape well the cob. For twelve ears 
take three eggs-, beat them well and add to the corn one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Mix well together and fry like griddle 
cakes. These cakes will be found very delicate. Serve with 
meat. • 

ESCALLOPED CORN. 
One can of corn or one pint fresh corn, season highly; 
add one egg, two spoonfuls of cream ; place in baking dish, 
cover with cracker crumbs and bits of butter. Bake ten 
minutes, just to brown nicely for luncheon. The corn, if 
fresh, must first be boiled until tender. 

CORN PUDDING. 

Scrape with a knife two dozen ears of corn, cut the 
grains and then scrape the cobs well. Melt one-half pound 
of butter ; stir into the corn and add one pint of milk, the 
yolks of three eggs well beaten, one teaspoonfulof salt, one 
saltspoonful of pepper, then add the whites beaten stiff. 
Pour the mixture into a baking dish and bake in a moderate 
oven for one hour and a quarter unless the corn is old, when 
a longer time will be necessary. 

CORN FRITTERS. 
One pint of corn, either fresh or canned. Make a 
batter of four eggs, one cup of milk, one teaspoonful of 
baking powder, one cup of flour, one teaspoonful of salt ;

mix these well together until light. Have the fat deep and 
boiling, then drop the mixture in spoonfuls into it and fry 
until the fritters are a light brown. 

STEWED CELERY. 

Take the outer stalks of celery, cut in pieces two inches 
in length, boil in milk until tender, add a little salt and 
pepper ; when cooked drain from the milk, put into the milk 
one teaspoonful of butter and one teaspoonful of flour mixed 
together, stir until the milk thickens and then pour over the 
celery. 

CAULIFLOWERS BOILED. 

Choose white, firm and small grained cauliflowers ; 
trim oflf the leaves and stalk ; wash them well in cold w^ater, 
in which put one tablespoonful of vinegar— by using this, 
any insect in the cauliflower will be sure to come out. Put 
the cauliflower in boiling water for five minutes, remove, 
cool and, drain, then boil again in two quarts of water with 
one teaspoonful of salt. You can tell if the cauliflower is 
done, if when you pinch a small piece, it is tender, though 
still firm. Serve with a white sauce, or sauce for cauli- 
flower. 

CAULIFLOWER WITH CHEESE. 

Cook the cauliflower in salted water ; when tender, 
drain from the water, put into a porcelain dish which will 
stand the heat of the oven ; cover with white sauce, then 
put two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese over it and some 
fine bread crumbs and bits of butter; when brown, serve 
hot. 

CUCUMBERS. 

It is a mistake to soak cucumbers in salted water to 
draw out the indigestible part ; it surely renders them un- 
palatable and wilts them. To prepare the cucumber prop- 
erly is to cut off the rind, then cut the cucumber into thin 
slices and place them in an earthern bowl with ice-water. 
Let them stand at least one hour before serving, they will 
then be crisp and the poisonous substance (to some) will be 
extracted. 



VEGETABLES. 1 37 

CUCUMBERS FRIED. 
Peel the cucumbers, cut in slices one-fourth of an inch 
in thickness, dip each slice in beaten egg and then into 
bread crumbs or into flour; fry brown the same as egg plant. 

CUCUMBERS-FOR FISH. 
Peel the cucumbers, then place in water for one hour, 
grate them, removing first the seeds, add to the pulp a 
French salad dressing ; this preparation of cucumbers is 
very nice served with fish. 

DRESSED CUCUMBERS. 
Take cucumbers, pare and chop them into small 
pieces. Take half the quantity of young onions and cut 
them fine ; add one tablespoonful of lemon juice, a trifle of 
cayenne, and a glass of sherry or Madeira and a dessert- 
spoonful of Chili vinegar. This is very good with any 
roast meat.

Cut the egg plant into slices one-fifth of an inch in 
thickness, sprinkle them with salt, pile them on each other 
and place a weight on the top ; leave them for three hours, 
then rinse and dry the slices, dip them into beaten egg and 
then into flour, fry them in hot lard ; serve hot. ' 

STUFFED EGG PLANT-i. 
Wash and dry one large egg plant, cut off the top like 
a lid; scoop out the inside of the egg plant, season it with 
salt and pepper; take one onion, peel and chop it very fine, 
put it into the saucepan with one tablespoonful of butter, 
cook these together for five minutes, do not brown ; add a 
few mushrooms chopped fine, one ounce of sausage meat ; 
cook all these together, carefully stirring all the time. Let 
the mixture cool, then fill the egg plant, tie on the lid, 
cover the egg plant with buttered paper ; cook in a hot oven 
for twenty minutes.

it well, then return the mixture to the shell of the egg 
plant, dip it in egg then in bread crumbs, and bake in the 
oven until it is browned. 

KOHLRABI OR CABBAGE TURNIP. 
Peel the turnips, cut them into small pieces, boil them 
until tender in salted water ; boil the green leaves of the 
tops, and when they are done, strain and chop them fine 
like spinach and return to the stewpan with a little butter, 
season wth salt and pepper. Put the turnips into the center 
of a dish, pour over a little melted butter, dish the greens 
around the turnips and serve hot. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS. 
Toast for each person a slice of bread and spread over 
it some cream. Lay on each slice of toast, with the head 
down, one mushroom, if large ; if small, two or three mush- 
rooms ; fill in each cup with as much cream as it will hold, 
with a bit of butter and a little salt and pepper. Place over 
the dish a closely-fitting cover ; the mushrooms should be in 
a shallow^ dish. Bake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes ; 
do not remove the cover until just before serving. Serve in 
the same dish, if possible, in which the mushrooms are 
baked. 

MUSHROOMS WITH BUTTER.

hot put in the mushrooms and shake them in the butter until 
they begin to brown ; in five minutes add one saltspoonful 
of salt and a little pepper, stew them until tender, remove 
from the pan and serve on hot toast. If any butter remains 
in the stewpan, put it into a small cup and keep for a steak 
or some chops the next day ; it will have a delicious flavor. 

MUSHROOMS STEWED— I. 

Take two tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half teaspoonful 

of pepper, one fourth teaspoonful of cayenne. Mix together 

into a paste, put in saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter ; 

when it is hot put in the mushrooms which have been 



VEGETABLES. 1 29 

peeled, place on each mushroom a little of the paste ; as 
soon as a brown sauce comes from the mushrooms, they are 
cooked and should be served at once on hot toast. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS— 2. 
Cut oflF the stems and boil in a cup of beef stock for 
twenty minutes and strain. Take one quart of mushrooms 
and strip off the skins, put into the stock and stew gently, 
add one-half cup of cream, one teaspoonful of butter, and 
thicken with a little flour, salt and pepper. Cook all about 
half an hour. 

ONIONS. 
Old onions are better steamed ; new onions stewed. 

ONIONS WITH CREAM. 
Parboil the onions, slice and spread them in layers in a 
baking dish with bits of butter; first onions, then bread 
crumbs and so on until the dish is full ; last add enough 
cream to fill the dish. Bake one-half hour. To parboil, 
put the onions into boiling water for ten minutes, then drain. 

ONION CUSTARD. 
Peel and slice twelve small-sized onions, fry them in one 
tablespoonful of butter, drain them well from the butter, 
then mince them very fine, add to them four eggs beaten

ful of salt and one-half teaspoonful of pepper ; cover for ten 
minutes, then remove the cover and cook for twenty minutes 
or longer. 

ONIONS IN GRAVY. 

Cook the onions in salted water until tender ; mix one 
tablespoonful of flour, one tablespoonful of butter over the 
fire until they are brown, then add one wine glass of claret, 
one cup of gravy ; serve hot. 

ONIONS STEAMED. 

Put the onions into a baking dish, cover it with a plate 
and let them steam in a hot oven for three hours, then pour- 
over them some melted butter, salt and pepper. 

STUFFED ONIONS. 

Take a large Spanish onion, scoop out the centre, peel 
and parboil it ; fill the centre with forcemeat and place it in 
a stew-pan ; cover it with slices of bacon, sprinkle with salt 
and sugar and cook over a quick fire. When done, remove 
the onions, reduce the sauce and pour it over them and serve. 
The forcemeat can be made of chicken, ham, parsley and 
mushrooms, and some chopped suet, all finely minced to- 
gether, with pepper and salt to taste. 

BAKED SPANISH ONIONS. 

Take a large onion ; wash it clean ; take a corer and 
remove the core and put in its place some butter, pepper

OKRA. 
Boil the young pods in salted, hot water ; when cooked, 
drain and dress them with some butter, pepper and salt. 

FRIED PARSLEY. 
Wash the parsley, dry thoroughly in a cloth, then put 
in hot, boiling fat and let it remain until crisp ; shake from 
the fat, sprinkle with salt, and use. To prepare parsley 
for sprinkling over any preparations, chop the parsley very 
fine, wash, drain, place in corner of a clean napkin and 
squeeze dry, then the parsley will be found very light and 
dry. 

PARSNIP BALLS. 
Boil six parsnips, let them get cold, then peel and grate 
them ; beat two eggs until light, mix them with the grated 
parsnip and one tablespoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of 
salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper ; make the mixture into 
small flat balls, have some lard boiling hot, drop the balls 
into it until they are brown ; serve hot with fried parsley. 

PARSNIPS BOILED. 
Boil the parsnips, then slice them and put over a dress- 
ing of one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, salt 
and pepper ; if cream is not obtainable one cup of sweet

spoonful of flour. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 
Take three large parsnips, cook until tender, peel and 
mash them smooth ; add one teaspoonful of flour, one 
egg well beaten, one teaspoonful of salt ; make the mixture 
into small cakes, and fry them on both sides in good butter ; 
pile them on a hot dish and serve. 

GREEN PEAS. 
If the peas are young and freshly gathered the very best 
way to cook them is to boil them in water, slightly salted ; 
do not cover the saucepan ; when cooked drain from the 
water, add a tablespoonful of butter and a little pepper. A 
sprig of mint is considered by many a valuable addition. 
If the peas are a little old cook them in a little water, add 



132 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

one tablespoonful of butter, a little salt and one teaspoonful 
of sugar; when served, add one tablespoonful of cream or 
one tablespoonful of butter. 

DRIED PEAS. 
Wash and pick them over carefully, put into boiling 
water and let them boil until soft, then drain off the water 
and put with the peas a piece of butter the size of an egg, a 
chopped onion, a little salt and pepper, and stew until the 
onion is cooked, then serve. 

GREEN PEPPER CROQUETTES. 
Select good-sized, firm sweet peppers, wash them, cut 
a small hole at the stem and remove all the seeds, then put 
the peppers in a stew-pan in a little boiling water to par- 
boil them, remove and let them cool. Stuff each pepper 
with a forcemeat, made with cold chicken, veal or sweet- 
breads minced fine and mixed with some bread crumbs, and 
seasoned with a little salt and a few drops of onion juice. 
Put the peppers when stuffed into a pan with a very little 
water to prevent burning; put bits of butter over the pep- 
pers ; when nicely browned remove from the pan and serve 
over the peppers some White sauce. 

GREEN PEPPERS FOR WINTER USE. 
Put the peppers on the back of the stove or in a cool 
oven, turn them until they are cooked enough to crack the 
skins, then throw them into a bowl of hot water and" with 
a knife scrape and peel them, cut them open, remove the 
seeds, rinse in cold water, drain them and pack into glass 
jars, pour boiling vinegar over them and a little salt, and 
seal. 

BOILED POTATOES. 
Potatoes should be very carefully boiled ; and if not 
used as soon as they are done, should be kept hot and dry, 
by pouring off the water, covering them with a dry cloth, 
and setting them on the back of the stove. After washing 
them thoroughly, pare them entirely, or take off one ring 
around each ; if they are new put them over the fire in hot 
water ; if they are old, put them on in cold water ; in either 
case, add a tablespoonful of salt, and boil them from fifteen 



VEGETABLES. I33 

to thirty minutes, as they require, until you can pierce 
them easily with a fork, then drain off the water, cover 
them with a clean, dry towel, and set them on the back of 
the fire until you are ready to use them. 

POTATOES A L'ANNA. 
Cut up some raw potatoes very fine, put them in cold 
water for six hours, then drain them, season with salt and 
pepper, put them into a well-buttered dish, sprinkle bread 
crumbs on top, add enough melted butter to cover them ; 
bake in a very hot oven for one-half hour or until they are 
well browned. If baked in a porcelain dish they can be 
served in it, a folded napkin being put around the dish, or 
they can be put on a hot dish. 

POTATO BALLS. 
Boil four large potatoes ; when hot mash and add to 
them one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one egg well 
beaten, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
pepper, a little grated nutmeg and a little cayenne. Mix 
these well together and roll into balls, dip them in beaten 
egg, then into fine bread or cracker crumbs ; be sure the 
crumbs are fine, and fry in deep boiling fat ; drain from the 
fat and keep hot until served. 

BAKED POTATOES. 

Choose large and smooth potatoes, put them in the 
oven ; when they are half done take each one in a kitchen 
towel and press it hard ; return to oven ; bake one hour. 

COLD BOILED POTATOES. 
All potatoes that are intended to be boiled and then 
made into different preparations should be boiled in their 
skins and not quite cooked ; set away and allowed to get cold 
in their skins. This plan makes a great difference in the 
successful preparation of potatoes, and should be followed. 

POTATOES CADEAU. 

Boil four large Irish potatoes in their skins and let 

them become cold; it is best to boil them the day before 

using ; grate the potatoes, add one egg beaten until light, 

one tablespoonful of flour, a little salt. Make the mixture 



134 TIIE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

into balls and roll them in flour. Have two kettles on the 
stove, one half full of boiling water, the other with boiling 
lard ; put the balls first into the boiling water, as soon as 
they rise on the surface, take from the water and drop into 
the lard, as soon as the balls are brown they are cooked. 

POTATOES WITH CHOCOLATE. 
Slice the cooked potatoes, put a layer of potatoes in a 
porcelain dish, which you can serve them in ; then a layer 
of sugar and butter, then a layer of potatoes, then a little 
more sugar and butter, then one tablespoonful grated 
chocolate dissolved in one cup of milk ; pour this over the 
potatoes and bake for twenty minutes. 

CREAMED POTATOES. 
Boil some potatoes ; when done remove from the fire 
and beat them until they are soft and creamy, then beat in 
the yolks of two eggs, a little salt and pepper, one table- 
spoonful of melted butter and two tablespoonfuls of cream ; 
lastly, add the whites beaten very stiff; put the mixture in 
the saucepan and let it become very hot. 

POTATO CAKES. 
One-half pound of flour, one-half a pound of mashed 
potatoes, six eggs, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one 
tablespoonful of sugar, one-half teaspoonful of salt. Sift 
the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into a bowl, then 
add the eggs well beaten, then enough sweet milk to make 
a light batter, lastly add the potatoes ; mix well and let 
all stand for one-half hour before baking, bake on well 
greased griddle like batter cakes. These cakes are very 
nice served with afternoon tea. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. 
Take two cups of mashed potatoes, add to them a iew 
drops of onion juice, the yolks of two eggs well beaten, one 
teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of cream, one table- 
spoonful of butter, a little cayenne. Stir all these ingredi- 
ents well together in the saucepan ; vvhen hot remove from 
the fire and let the mixture cool ; when cold form into balls, 
dip these first into beaten eggs, then into very fine cracker 
or bread crumbs ; see that the balls are smooth, place in the 



VEGETABLES. 135 

ice-box for an hour or more. When required try them in 
very hot deep fat. It is best to use the frying basket ; when 
the balls are of a brown color drain from the fat on brown 
paper. Keep them hot until served. 

POTATOES CRUMBED. 
Peel and boil the potatoes ; when they are cooked but 
not broken, split them in halves, season with salt and 
pepper, pour over them some melted butter, then dip each 
piece in browned bread crumbs, place them in a buttered 
tin and bake for fifteen minutes in a hot oven. 

ESCALLOPED POTATOES. 
Pare, wash and slice enough potatoes to nearly fill the 
baking dish ; season the potatoes with salt and pepper ; 
add little bits of butter all through the dish, then pour over 
the potatoes enough milk, or better, cream, to fill up the 
dish ; put one tablespoonful of butter on top of the dish ; 
bake. Keep the dish covered until the potatoes are nearly 
done, then uncover and let them brown. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 
Peel the potatoes, cut them in narrow strips, soak in 
ice w^ater one hour, drain and dry, have ready a kettle of 
deep lard ; when boiling drop in the potatoes a few at a 
time and let them brown, sprinkle salt over them when 
they are removed from the fat, drain on wire dish or on 
filtering paper; serve in a hot dish. 

FRIED POTATOES— I. 
Take six good potatoes, peel and slice them about 
one-fourth of an inch in thickness. Have two pans of fat, 
either clarified beef suet or lard ; cook the potatoes in one 
for a few minutes, then remove them with a skimmer and 
put them into the other pan ; the fats must be very hot. The 
potatoes will swell and be much lighter from the double 
frying. 

FRIED POTATOES— 2. 
Peel the potatoes, slice them lengthwise about one- 
eighth of an inch thick, place in cold water for a few 
minutes, then drain and fry them in hot fat for six minutes, 



136 THB 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

remove from the fat, let them cool. Keep the fat hot (it 
must be deep fat), and just before serving the potatoes 
plunge them into the boiling fat for five minutes ; this will 
cause them to swell ; then remove from the fat, drain them, 
sprinkle with salt and serve at once. 

POTATOES FRIED WITH PARSLEY, 

One pound of potatoes, two ounces of butter, two tea- 
spoonfuls of chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Scrape and 
boil the potatoes ; let them get cold. Put the butter into 
the frying pan ; when melted put in the potatoes and fry a 
pale gold ; add the parsley about five minutes before serving ; 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. 

HASHED BROWN POTATOES. 

Six potatoes cut fine. Take two tablespoonfuls of 
onions cut fine and one tablespoonful of parsley chopped 
fine ; put these into hot lard and fry them ; as soon as the 
onions commence to brown add the potatoes, stirring all 
together; press the mixture down on the pan, let it brown, 
then stir again, so as to mix the crust well; when the 
potatoes are well mixed with the crust add one tablespoon- 
ful of butter ; press the potatoes well on the pan so that 
they will have- a good brown crust; turn them out on a 
platter, the crust side up. 

POTATO KLOSSE. 

Take about six baked potatoes and scoop out the floury 
part till there are about six ounces. Beat one tablespoonful 
of butter to a cream and mix it with the potato flour ; add 
the well beaten yolks of two eggs, a grate of nutmeg and a 
little pepper and salt to taste. Beat the mixture thoroughly 
and mold it into small balls. Drop these in boiling salt 
and water, and be careful to do this with a metal spoon, 
and to dip it into boiling water each time it is used. Or 
they may be made with two ounces of finely-grated bread 
crumbs and one ounce of Parmesan, the white of one of the 
eggs, then molded and boiled as above. Sprinkle fried 
bread crumbs over when dishing them up.

and lay them in the pan with the meat about one hour be- 
fore the meat is done. Serve with the roast. 

POTATO RISSOLES. 
Two pounds of potatoes, one-fourth pound of butter, 
pepper and salt; two eggs, dried crumbs, one-fourth pint of 
milk. Boil your potatoes in their skins, skin them and 
mash them with the butter; add the seasoning and milk. 
Make into balls, brush over with yolk of egg and crumbs. 
Fry three minutes in boiling fat in a frying basket. 

SARATOGA POTATOES. 
Slice three potatoes as thin as possible, throw them into 
a bowl of ice-water, keep them in the ice-water for two or 
three hours. When ready to use the potatoes, have the 
kettle of fat very hot ; you must have deep fat, at least four 
inches deep. Dry the potatoes by putting a few at a time 
in a clean coarse towel, drop them into the boiling fat, a 
few at a time. Stir, to prevent them from sticking to- 
gether. The moment they are of a light yellow color 
remove with the skimmer'; drain on brown paper. These 
potatoes should never be greasy, and they will not be if the 
fat is at the right temperature and care is used. 

POTATO SNOW. 
Have some very mealy potatoes ; boil ; when cooked 
drain and keep them hot ; heat the colander and pass

well in two waters and be sure you have removed all sand ; 
cut off the roots and stems, drain the leaves, put them into a 
large kettle containing one quart of boiling water and one 
tablespoonful of salt ; toss and turn the leaves for ten min- 
utes ; remove from the pot, drain them in a colander ; when

TO PICKLE SAUER KRAUT. 

Select firm, white cabbages, leave out the outer leaves 
and stalks, begin at the top of the head to cut across in 
narrow strips using a large knife ; have a small oak barrel 
or pickling jar or tub, cover the bottom with clean cabbage 
leaves, throw in the cabbage as fast as it is shredded, sprinkle 
with salt ; stamp it down hard with a club ; when all is 
closely packed, strew more salt on top, cover with some 
cabbage leaves and then with a clean linen cloth. Put on 
a cover that will fit closely and on this a heavy stone. 

Do not put the kraut in too cool a place qr fermentation 
will not begin. When it has begun small white globules 
will form on the brine, which should appear in two or three 
days ; if they do not, boil some salt and w^ater, cool and 
pour over the cabbage. 

A large handful of salt is enough for a firkin of cut 
cabbage ; too much salt prevents fermentation. In two 
weeks the cloth over the kraut must be taken off and wash- 
ed and the leaves renewed, then cover again — the washing 
of the cloth must be done every week. 

In three weeks it will be ready for use, and will keep 
good for a year. 

SAUER KRAUT COOKED. 

One tablespoonful of butter ; melt this in a saucepan, 
then put in half as much sauer kraut as needed, and a piece 
of pork, bacon, ham or sausage ; lay over this the rest of the 
kraut, but in a glass of vinegar, a little water ; cover all 
closely and stew gently until the kraut is soft and yellow. 
Remove the meat when it is done ; dredge in a little flour ; 
cook one-half hour longer ; put back the meat to heat thor- 
oughly ; stir the kraut and serve. 

Sauer kraut is equally good warmed over, and it should 
be cpoked three hours the first time. A little onion can be 
added if liked.

RICE, ETC. 147 



RICE, ETC. 



TO BOIL RICE. 

One quart of water with one teaspoonful of salt. When 
boiling hard, put in one pint of well-washed rice. As soon 
as the water boils hard again, remove to the back of the 
range and let the rice cook slowly ; when all the water is 
boiled away, cover the rice until it is perfectly cooked, do 
not stir at all — be careful not to burn the rice. 

The addition of a little lemon juice to the water in 
which rice is boiled will increase the whiteness, and the 
grains will readily separate. 

RICE CROQUETTES WITH MEAT. 

Boil the rice until quite soft and tender ; while warm 
add an egg well beaten, a teaspoonful of butter, and salt to 
taste, and half a teacupful of any kind of cold meat, ham or 
tongue, chopped fine. When cold, make into croquettes, 
cover with beaten egg and bread crumbs, and fry in hot 
dripping-pan till browned. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

One-fourth pound of rice well-washed and dried, one 
pint of milk ; boil them together until the rice is perfectly 
tender. A thin rind of lemon cooked with the rice is an 
addition. When the rice is rather dry and tender add one 
tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of butter, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little pepper and a little nutmeg. Stir 
together and spread on a dish to cool ; when cold form into 
croquettes ; dip each one in beaten egg, then into fine 
crumbs, either of bread or crackers ; put on the ice for an 
hour or more, then fry in deep hot fat until a light brown 
color, and serve at once.

oil, one quart of stock. Cut the onion fine, cook well in the 
butter and oil until of a golden color, mix it in the rice, add 
the w^ine, then one-half the stock (one pint), add the rest of 
the stock, a little at a time until the rice is done and the 
mixture thickens— it must boil fast and hard ; when almost 
done, add the saffron and last the cheese ; after removing it 
from the stove add a piece of butter. The Risotto should 
be a trifle thicker than a puree. 

RICE CASSEROLE. 
Wash two pounds of rice in water twice ; drain and 
put into a stewpan with two quarts of water, one salt- 
spoonful of salt ; when the water boils, cover the rice with 
some thin slices of salt pork and let it simmer slowly until

gather it into balls and mold it into the shape of a casserole, 
then brush the casserole over with a brush dipped in melted 
butter, and put it into the oven until it is slightly brown, 
then trim it and take out some of the rice inside and fill the 
casserole with any preparation you wish, sweetbreads, 
game, chicken, fish, etc.

cheese, add to the cheese a little cayenne and soda the size 
of a pea. Put first a layer of rice in a buttered pudding 
dish, then a layer of cheese; when the dish is full, put a 
thin layer of powdered cracker crumbs and bits of butter 
and over the whole pour the following mixture : One cup- 
ful of milk, one egg well beaten into it, one saltspoonful of

until the rice is tender, then add two tablespoonfuls of 
blanched almonds chopped fine. Put the rice mixture into 
shallow dishes and shake until the surface is smooth, then 
sift over thickly some powdered cinnamon, which will give 
it the appearance of a freshly baked cake. Serve cold. It 
will remain good for several days. If desired richer, one- 
third cream may be used in the place of the milk. 

SAVORY RICE. 

Put one-fourth pound of rice in fast boiling, salted 
water ; when half cooked, pour off the water and replace it 
with three-fourths pint of good stock, and cook until the

grated cheese and one egg well beaten. Pour this all into 
a buttered dish, and bake or brown in oven. 

RICE SOCLES. 
Wash one pound of rice ; put it in a stewpan with half 
a gallon of water and a little salt ; boil on a very slow fire. 
When the rice is done pound it in a mortar, and mold it to

egged over and put in the oven to color it. For cold dishes, 
spread the rice over with Montpelier butter. 

TIMBALE OF RICE. 
One teacupful of rice, one pound of any cooked meat, 
one egg, two tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one-half a 
small onion, one-fourth pint of stock, salt and pepper, one

stQck about a half hour, add mushrooms sliced. Put some 
butter in a small saucepan and when it melts, add what 
flour you think it will need to thicken ; dip the sauce from 
the macaroni, add it slowly to the flour stirring all the time ; 
then pour it over the macaroni, being careful not to break 
the macaroni. Just before serving, strew with chopped 
parsley ; then having the macaroni in the dish in which it is

RICE, ETC. 153 

HOMINY CROQUETTES. 

Take one cupful of cold boiled hominy, add one teacup- 
ful of milk, stir this well into the hominy, add one tea- 
spoonful of sugar and one well-beaten egg and a little salt. 
Make the mixture into croquettes, dip them in beaten egg, 
then in fine bread crumbs. Put on the ice for an hour or 
more ; when needed, fry them in deep hot fat. 

SMALL HOMINY OR GRITS. 

Soak the hominy over night, boil in a little salted water, 
stir very frequently — it should bfe as thick as mush. It can 
be eaten as a breakfast dish with cream and sugar, or as a 
vegetable with butter, salt and pepper with it. Serve hot. 
Any left over is very nice, cut in slices and fried in a little 
butter.

CHEESE PREPARATIONS. 



CHEESE. 

Cheese is regarded as a most important article of food ; 
it contains more nutri'tious material than any other food that 
is ordinarily obtainable. Mr. W. Matthieu Williams, in 
his " Chemistry of Cookery," says : " All that is required to 
render it, next to bread, the staple food of the world, is 
scientific cookery." Mr. Williams advises the use of a very 
little bicarbonate of potash in all cheese dishes. 

AIGRETTES OF PARMESAN. 
One-fourth pint of water, two ounces of butter, two 
ounces of flour, two ounces of grated cheese (Parmesan), 
two eggs, one-fourth ounce pepper and salt. Put the water 
into the saucepan with the butter, let it boil, shake in the 
flour, cook well ; add the cheese, the eggs, well beaten, one 
at a time. Have ready some boiling fat and drop in about 
a dessert-spoonful of the mixture at a time ; fry a golden 
brown, and serve very hot. 

CHEESE BALLS. 
Two cups of grated cheese, the whites of two eggs 
beaten very light, one tablespoonful of cream, one saltspoon- 
ful of salt, a little cayenne, five drops of Worcestershire 
sauce. Mix all these together, then make into small balls, 
dip them in beaten egg and fine bread crumbs ; fry in hot 
deep lard. 

CHEESELETS. 
A saucer three-fourths full of grated cheese, mix with 
it the whites of three eggs beaten stiff, add a pinch of salt, 
a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Form into balls, roll 
in cracker crumbs (very fine), drop in boiling lard. To be 
made during the dinner and served directly with the salad. 



CHEESE PREPARATIONS. 155 

CHEESE CUSTARDS. 

Take two ounces of grated cheese, three teaspoonfuls 
of milk or cream, one egg well beaten, a little cayenne and 
salt to taste. Beat all well together, bake in a small dish 
in a gentle oven for fifteen or twenty minutes and serve 
very hot. 

CdTTAGE CHEESE. 

Take sour milk, put it on the range until the milk 
crinkles, then put it in a colander and drain off all the whey ; 
beat the cheese until very light, add a little cream and salt, 
and make into balls and pour over them some rich cream. 

CHEESE FONDUE— I. 

The fondue must be baked in the dish in which it is 
served — a small silver dish or a French porcelain one is 
suitable. Mix one tablespoonful of butter and one table- 
spoonful of flour in the saucepan, stir until they bubble, 
then add one gill of rich milk ; this will make a thick white 
sauce; stir constantly to prevent burning ; when smooth, 
stir into the sauce three tablespoonfuls of grated cheese 
(good York State cheese), one small saltspoonful of salt, a 
little cayenne. Turn the mixture into a bowl, stir in the 
well-beaten yolks of two eggs ; whip the whites of three 
eggs very stiff and stir them in very gently at the last. 
Butter the dish in which the fondue is to be baked ; the 
fondue must half fill it. Bake until it is a golden brown in 
hot oven. Serve at once. 

CHEESE FONDUE— 2. 

One cup of bread crumbs fine and dry, two cups of 
milk, one-half pound of cheese grated, three eggs, whipped 
very light, one tablespoonful of melted butter, pepper and salt, 
a pinch of soda dissolved in a little hot water and stirred 
into the milk. Soak the crumbs in the milk, beat the eggs 
and stir into the crumbs and milk, then add the cheese. 
Butter the baking dish, pour the mixture into it, strew some 
dry crumbs on the top, and bake in a hot oven. 

A very little soda should be put in all cheese prepara- 
tions.

it is melted, then add one half pint of cream and two eggs, 
add a little salt and a small pinch of soda ; serve at once on 
toast. 

WELSH RAREBIT— I. 

The secret of making Welsh rarebit digestible, is to add 
paprika to the cheese. One pound of full cream American 
cheese, one teaspoonful of butter, when hot stir in the 
cheese ; add slowly as it melts, two spoonfuls of ale ; when 
smooth, put in the paprika. Put on hot toast.

EGGS. 



Eggs contain all that is required for the building up of 
the body. 

EGG BALLS. 
Boil four eggs until they are hard, then put into cold 
water for a little while, remove the shells and take the yolks, 
pound them smooth, add one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of pepper, a little cayenne and one yolk of raw 
egg. Make the mixture into small balls, roll them in flour, 
fry them with a little butter until they are a delicate brown ; 
serve with mock turtle soup or other soups. 

BAKED EGGS— I. 
Put some good gravy into a shallow baking dish. 
Break four eggs or as many as are required into this, salt 
them, and sprinkle some bread crumbs over them, and bake 
for five minutes in a quick oven. Take up the eggs care- 
fully one by one, and lay upon little rounds of fried bread. 
Add to the gravy a little cream and some very finely chopped 
parsley and onion ; put into a saucepan and boil up quickly 
and pour over the eggs. 

BAKED EGGS— 2. 
Spread a thick layer of fresh butter on a tin or fireproof 
china dish, sprinkle with salt, and break the eggs carefully 
onto it, one at a time ; pour some cream over them, season 
with salt, pepper and one grate of nutmeg; place a few 
small lumps of butter over all, bake in the oven for four 
minutes. 

BAKED EGGS— 3. 
Boil eggs until hard, then put them into cold water ; 
when cold remove the shells, chop the eggs very fine, add 
one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper ; stir 



EGGS. l6l 

together ; put the eggs into a porcelain dish ; first P^t a layer 
of breadcrumbs, then a layer of the eggs, then bread crumbs, 
eggs, or until the dish is full ; then put bits of butter over 
the top with some bread crumbs ; lastly pour over all one 
cup of cream ; bake fifteen minutes. 

EGGS AND CHEESE. 
Take the small china dishes that vs^ill stand the heat ; 
place in each a bit of butter, a little chopped parsley, break 
over a fresh egg, sprinkle on the top of the egg some grated 
cheese — American cheese is excellent for this, a few bread 
crumbs and a little salt and pepper ; bake in a hot oven for 
three minutes, and serve in the same dish in which they 
are baked. 

EGGS WITH CREAM— I. 
Poach eggs in boiling water, allowing one for each 
person to be served ; trim them and dish on a slice of bread ; 
pour over some hot cream sauce ; sprinkle some chopped 
parsley or truffles over, and place around the eggs slices of 
hot, fried bacon cut thin and rolled. 

EGGS WITH CREAM— 2. 
Cover the bottom of a porcelain plate with cream ; 
break on this the eggs carefully ; let them bake for four 
minutes ; sprinkle a little salt and pepper and a bit of butter 
on each egg, and serve in the same dish in which they are 
baked. 

EGG CROQUETTES. 
One ounce of butter, one pint of flour, one pint of boil- 
ing water, five eggs. Mix the flour with the water in a 
saucepan ; when well cooked take it off the fire and cool the 
mixture ; when cold add the eggs one by one, beat the batter 
very hard before the eggs are put in, and after, drop the 
batter in little bits like eggs, into deep boiling lard. 

DEVILLED EGGS. 

Take as many eggs as there are persons to be served ; 

break them into the saucepan and fry them until the whites 

are firm ; be careful not to break the yolks ; trim the eggs 

nicely and place them on a hot dish ; pour over them this 



1 63 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

sauce, which should be ready at the same time the eggs 
are to be served. Put into a stewpan one tablespoonful of 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of cream, a little cayenne, one 
saltspoonful of salt, one teaspoonf ul of French mustard, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of English mustard, one tablespooonful 
of tomato catsup, the yolks of two raw eggs. Stir together 
on the fire until the sauce thickens, add one tablespoonful 
of finely minced cold ham, and one green pepper cut very 
fine (if convenient); serve. 

FRIED EGGS— I. 

When the frying pan is hot put in a little butter, then 
place the pan on a cooler part of the stove, break into the 
pan , one at a time, the eggs ; if the eggs are put into the pan 
when it is very hot they they will burst and crack. 

FRIED EGGS— 2. 

One tablespoonful of olive oil, put into the saucepan ; 
when hot, drop gently into it the eggs. As soon as the eggs 
are cooked, carefully remove from the oil ; the whites should 
have a yellow edge. It is very necessary that the eggs for 
frying should be most carefully put into the pan so as not to 
break the yolks. In place of the oil, butter can be used. 
Serve very hot ; sprinkle over the j'olks a litttle salt and 
pepper. 

EGGS IN A NEST. 

Toast some slices of bread a dainty brown and pare off 
the crust, leaving an oval of toast ; on this put a big tea- 
spoonful of white of egg beaten to a stiff froth ; drop the 
yolk in the center, with pepper, salt and a tiny bit of butter, 
and set in the oven until it becomes a golden brown. 

EGGS ON THE PLATE. 

Rub the plate well with butter, sprinkle a little salt 
and pepper over, then break the eggs carefully ; do not break 
the yolks ; put bits of butter on the eggs, and put one spoon- 
ful of cream for each egg ; put the plate on a tin containing 
a little hot water, and stand in the oven for five minutes, 
and serve hot 



EGGS. 163 

POACHED EGGS. 

A wide and shallow pan is the best for poaching eggs 
in ; half fill the pan with boiling water slightly salted ; break 
the eggs carefully into a saucer separately and slide them 
into the water; let them simmer for two minutes, then let 
the water boil for another minute ; this detaches the eggs 
from the pan ; then remove the eggs with a pancake turner; 
place them on slices of hot toast or on minced meat or fish. 

Eggs can be poached in milk ; all eggs for poaching 
must be perfectly fresh. 

Three drops of Worcestershire sauce on each egg just 
before it is quite cooked, is a great addition to a poached egg. 

POACHED EGGS WITH ANCHOVY PASTE. 
Make six slices of toast, butter and spread over them 
some anchovy paste and place in the oven for a few 
minutes. Poach six eggs and place an egg on each piece of 
toast, add a very little salt and pepper to each top and serve 
very hot. 

PLAIN OMELETTE. 
Beat three eggs lightly with a little salt and pepper, 
add three tablespoonfuls of hot water. Put a little butter in 
the omelette pan ; when hot, pour in the eggs, stir continu- 
ally with a fork so that all may cook evenly; the omelette 
must cook quickly ; when the eggs are set, run the knife 
under the omelette which is nearest the handle of the pan ; 
turn this half over on the other half ; take a hot plate and 
place it on the edge of the pan and flop the omelette on to it 
This is a plain omelette ; all other varieties are made by 
adding the ingredients after the eggs are put into the pan. 

OMELETTE CELESTINE. 

One-half a pint of milk, boil with it two tablespoonfuls 
of rice flour, four ounces of sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla 
extract, simmer for ten minutes, stirring constantly, add 
then the yolks of three eggs mixed with a little milk, and 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, then add the whites beaten 
light, and divide the mixture, making two omelettes ; put 
one-half in the pan, having a little hot butter in the pan ; 
when the omelette is ready to fold, put over it one table- 
spoonful of marmalade, fold over the omelette and serve hot. 



164 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

SPANISH OMELETTE. 

One large tomato cut in pieces, one small green pepper 
cut in pieces, one small onion sliced, one teaspoonful of 
parsley chopped fine, one teaspoonful of celery chopped fine, 
half a can of mushrooms cut in pieces. Cook these together 
for a few minutes, then put with the omelette when it is in 
the pan. 

ORANGE OMELETTE. 

For three eggs use the thinly-grated rind of one orange 
and three tablespoonfuls of the juice. Beat the yolks until 
light, add three tablespoonfuls of fine sugar, then the juice 
and rind of the orange ; beat the whites of the eggs until 
light, fold them in the mixture and then all into an omelette 
pan, cook until set, then place in a moderate oven and lightly 
brown. Serve on a hot dish. 

STUFFED EGGS. 
Boil as many eggs as you require until they are hard ; 
put them in cold water, when cold remove the shells, cut 
the eggs in halves ; cut with a warm, sharp knife ; remove 
the yolks, mash them into a smooth paste, with one table- 
spoonful of olive oil, or two tablespoonfuls of melted butter ; 
one saltspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of cayenne, 
one-fourth saltspoonful of mustard. Mix these all together 
until smooth, then fill in the eggs and press the two halves 
together ; place upon a bed of lettuce leaves. If desired, a 
mayonnaise sauce can be poured over the eggs. 

SCOTCH EGGS. 
Boil one-half dozen eggs twenty minutes and then drop 
them into cold water. Chop very fine, enough lean cooked 
ham to make one cupful. Cook one-third of a cup of stale 
bread crumbs in the same amount of milk and stir until it is 
a smooth paste. Take it from the fire and mix the prepared 
ham with the paste. Add half a teaspoonful of made 
mustard and half a saltspoonful of paprika ; lastly stir in a 
beaten egg and mix well. Remove the shells from the 
boiled eggs and cover the eggs with a thick coating of this 
mixture. With a spoon cover the outside of this mixture 
with a partly beaten egg and then roll them in fine bread 
crumbs. Lay the prepared eggs in a frying basket and put 



EGGS. 165 

them in a cold place until required ; then fry them in hot 
lard to a nice brown and let them drain on brown paper in 
the mouth of the oven, where they will remain hot. Cut 
some rather thin slices of bread and with a biscuit cutter 
make them into round pieces. Toast and butter these slices 
of bread and lay them on a hot platter. With a sharp 
knife cut each egg into halves lengthwise and lay them upon 
the toast with the cut side down. Garnish the dish with 
watercresses and serve them with the eggs. A bechamel 
or cream sauce is often served with the eggs in place of the 
cresses. 

SWISS EGGS. 

Spread two ounces of butter on a dish, and lay on it 
six thin slices of Swiss cheese ; break six eggs upon this, 
keeping the yolks whole. Sprinkle over some salt and 
pepper. Mix a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and two 
ounces of grated Swiss cheese together and strew over them. 
Bake in a very quick oven for about five minutes. 

EGGS A LA TRIPE. 

Allow one egg to each person to be served. Boil them 
for eight minutes, then slice them, using a warm, wet knife 
for the purpose. Butter a porcelain dish, put in the bottom 
a layer of cream sauce, then a layer of the sliced eggs, 
sprinkle over them a little finely chopped onion or shallot, 
some chopped parsley ; continue these layers until the dish 
is full, having the cream sauce for the last layer, put over 
some fine bread crumbs and some bits of butter. Place the 
dish in a tin half filled with boiling water and put into the 
oven for fifteen minutes, then take from the oven, sprinkle 
over the top some hard-boiled yolk of egg, which has been 
passed through a fine sieve, and serve.

SAVORIES. 



Savories are served w^ith the salad course at dinner or 
at luncheon. 

SAVORIES. 
(anchovies.) 
Take two hard boiled eggs, mash the yolks with one 
saltspoonful of salt, two mustard spoonfuls of French mus- 
tard ; rub the whole together, then add slowly two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon 
vinegar, stir all one way until all are blended smoothly, then 
add two filletted anchovies, which have been well pounded ; 
lastly add one-half gill of whipped cream and spread the 
mixture on thinly cut brown bread. 

ANCHOVY STRAWS. 
Take "anchovies in oil," dry them and cut into long, 
thin strips ; roll each strip in pastry and fry in deep, hot 
fat ; pile them two by two over each other and serve hot. 

ANCHOVY TOAST. 
Toast thin slices of bread, butter them and spread over 
some anchovy paste ; serve hot. 

A SAVORY WITH BACON. 
Among the many excellent ways of serving bacon the 
following is one of the best. The bacon may be prepared 
and can be easily cooked the last moment over the fire in a 
frying pan ; or if desired it may be cooked upon the table in 
a chafing dish. Skin and bone some sardines ; add to them 
some paprika, a little chopped parsley (or lemon juice may 
be used in place of parsley), and some butter. Rub these 
ingredients together, making them into a smooth paste. 
Spread this paste upon thin slices of bacon and roll each

toothpick. Lay the prepared slices in a hot frying pan and 
cook quickly. Serve very hot. ■■ 

.CAVIARE CANAPES-i. 
Cut some slices of bread one-fourth inch thick, cut with 
the two-inch cutter into rounds. Fry in hot fat until both 
sides are brown. To one-fourth cup of butter made soft and 
creamy, add one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of 
paprika and one teaspoonful of watercress. Make into balls 
and let them become hard ; w^hen needed, spread on the 
bread slices and then put on a layer of caviare and squeeze 
a little lemon juice over all. To prepare the cress, wash 
and drain, then chop very fine, then squeeze it dry in a cloth. 

CAVIARE CANAPES-3. 
Cut some slices of bread a quarter of an inch thick, cut 
them out with a plain two-inch cutter and fry these rounds 
in a little butter till of a light golden color. When cold 
spread them over with Montpelier butter and place a layer 
of caviare on the top. Squeeze lemon over them and serve. 

CRACKERS.

and then cover thickly with fine grated cheese. Place them 
in a baking pan and sprinkle a little sherry over them. Bake 
in a hot oven until slightly browned and serve at once. 

EGG SAVORY. 
Cook half a can of tomatoes eight minutes with a tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley and a teaspoonful of chopped 
onion ; add five eggs after beating them a little, and stir all 
together briskly until consistency of scrambled eggs. Add 
cayenne pepper and salt to taste. Thin slices of green pep-

from which the crusts have been removed, and spread with 
anchovy paste ; then serve immediately. 

GASCONY BUTTER. 
Take equal quantities of parsley picked from the stalk 
and parboiled, of boned and pounded anchovies, and of fresh 
butter. Mix the ingredients well together and pass them 



l68 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

through a hair sieve ; shape the butter into little balls and 
put on the ice for one hour. These are nice little relishes 
for breakfasf or lunch. 

HAM BUTTER. 

Pound together one hard-boiled yolk of egg, two table- 
spoonfuls of cooked ham, two tablespoonfuls of butter, a 
little cayenne. Mix until smooth. This butter is very nice 
spread on hot toast for breakfast or to use as a savory. 

OLIVE CUSTARDS. 
Take one ounce of grated cheese to one egg well beaten ; 
mix this over the fire until it becomes a very thick custard ; 
fry some neat little rounds of bread in butter, spread them 
very thinly with anchovy paste and pour on each a small 
quantity of the custard. Stone some olives, and put one in 
the middle of each round. 

PUFF PASTE STRAWS WITH BLOATER PASTE. 
One-fourth of a pound of flour, rub into it one table- 
spoonful of bloater paste, a little cayenne, one-half cup of 
cold water ; make into a smooth paste, roll it out and put on 
on it one-fourth of a pound of butter, fold it up and roll out 
six times, lastly roll out to one-eighth of an inch in thick- 
ness ; cut it into strips two inches long and one inch wide

SAVORIES. 169 

SARDINES WITH CHEESE. 

Take small sardines, drain them from the oil, remove 
the skin and tip of the tail, and put over the fish a sprinkle 
of cheese grated fine. Make some slices of toast a little 
larger than the sardines, butter them and put the sardines 
on, place in the oven to wrarm, but not to become crisp, and 
serve hot. 

ICED SAVORY SOUFFLE. 

This dish can be made of almost any kind of fish, 
chicken or game ; it is excellent with lobster meat. Cut up 
the lobster or whatever it may be, into very small pieces ; 
let it soak in mayonnaise sauce for two or three hours. 
Have some well-flavored aspic jelly and whip it till it is 
frothy. Put some of this at the bottom of the dish it is to 
be served in, then place a layer of the lobster and fill it up 
with aspic and lobster alternately till the mold is nearly 
full; place a stiff band of paper round, and fill it with 
whipped aspic. Put it on ice for two hours, take off the 
paper and serve. 

SAVORY. 

CHEESE, EGGS AND TOMATOES.

grated cheese, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, 
a little mustard, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, butter the size of an egg, and hot toast. 
Beat the eggs ; mix in the cheese, seasoning, tomatoes, 
melt the butter; when hot stir all the ingredients together

SAVORY. 

CHEESE AND EGGS. 

Cut six slices of bread, remove the crusts, fry them 
until a light brown in hot fat ; keep them warm while you 
beat together two ounces of cheese cut fine, one ounce of 
butter and the yolk of one egg ; when the butter and cheese 
are melted, stir in the yolk, add salt and pepper and a little 
nutmeg, spread the mixture on the bread and serve at once. 



170 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

SAVORY BUTTER. 

Pound to a paste four ounces of rich cheese with a 
small piece of butter (this varies with the dryness of the 
cheese), a couple of spoonfuls of vinegar from pickled 
walnuts, a good dash of cayenne, a dessertspoonful of 
essence of anchovy and the same of mustard. This mixture, 
if heated over the fire, makes a delicious savory toast. 

A SAVORY OF SEMOLINA. 

Two tablespoonfuls of semolina ; stir into one pint of 
boiling milk, with a little salt, until it has the thickness of 
cream. Boil carefully (as milk is quick to burn) until it. 
has the taste of being thoroughly cooked. In the mean- 
time be.at the eggs, whites and yolks separately, about four 
to a pint of new milk. Stir in the yolks, keeping the sauce- 
pan a little longer on the fire ; follow with the whites and 
pour into a large shallow vessel. Place in a cool place for 
several hours until thoroughly set, when the semolina should 
be cut into pieces a couple of inches square, sprinkled over 
with grated cheese, and baked quickly in a hot oven. 

SCOTCH WOODCOCK. 

Eight hard-boiled eggs, chop them fine ; one cup of 
milk, when boiling stir into it one tablespoonful of flour 
well mixed into two tablespoonfuls of butter, add one table- 
spoonful of anchovy paste, a little cayenne and a little salt ; 
stir in the eggs, heat for one minute, then pour the mixture 
on to pieces of hot toast and serve at once.

A FEW BREAKFAST DISHES. I 77 



A FEW BREAKFAST DISHES. 



"A LITTLE BREAKFAST DISH." 

Cut two long slices of cold meat and three of bread, 
buttered thickly, the same size and shape ; season the meat 
with pepper, salt and a little chopped parsley, or if veal is 
used, a little chopped ham, then lay one slice of the bread 
between two of the meat, and have the other two slices out- 
side ; fasten together with little wooden skewers. Put into 
a hot oven, baste with butter thoroughly, so that the bread 
is crisp and brown ; serve hot. 

BREAKFAST CUSTARD. 
One-half pint of sweet milk, two eggs if large ones, if 
not three eggs. Beat the eggs together until light, stir into 
the milk, add a little pinch of salt ; butter a pint bowl, pour 
in the mixture, and set the bowl in a tin of hot water, place 
in hot oven and bake for twenty minutes. Have a hot plate, 
turn the custard on this and pour over it a tomato sauce, or 
a sauce made of mushrooms, or a cream sauce. 

COLD MEAT BALLS. 
Chop the meat fine, season with salt and pepper ; make 
the meat into balls or flat cakes, fry them in a little butter 
or dripping. Fry some salt pork or bacon cut in thin slices 
and place around the balls. 

CROQUETTES. 
Stir into a cup of milk enough crustless bread to make 
a nice consistency (as glutinous as possible) ; add to this a 
cupful of cold meat of any kind, chopped fine. Season with 
a little chopped onion, chopped parsley, a piece of butter, 
salt and pepper. A few sliced mushrooms and some chopped 
truffles are, of course, an addition. This should be prepar- 
ed in the afternoon and allowed to remain in the ice chest ' 



lyS THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

until it is very cold. An hour before breakfast, remove from 
the ice and form the mixture into any desired shape, dip 
each croquette into the beaten yolk of an egg and then in 
bread crumbs, and place in the frying basket and put it back 
on the ice and do not again remove it until the fat is at the 
boiling point. By plunging the partly frozen forms into 
the intense heat, a coating, as it were, is formed, whereby 
the desired moisture inside is obtained as well as the possi- 
bility of maintaining the outward shapeliness. 

DRIED BEEF WITH EGGS. 
One-fourth pound of thinly sliced dried beef — shred it 
and let it lie in cold water for about fifteen minutes, then 
drain and cover the beef with milk, about one pint ; put on 
the stove, and when it begins to simmer, add one teaspoon- 
ful of flour, dissolved in one tablespoonful of cold milk ; one 
tablespoonful of butter, a little salt and pepper. As soon as 
the flour has cooked, break into the saucepan three eggs 
without beating, stir all rapidly until the eggs are cooked. 
Have several slices of hot toast ready, well buttered, and 
serve the beef, etc., on the toast— this will be enough for five 
half slices of toast. 

EGG TOAST. 
Six slices of bread, one egg, one cupful of milk, one 
salispoonful of salt. Beat the egg until light, add to the 
milk, also add the salt. Dip the slices of bread in the mix- 
ture, then have the griddle hot, grease it with a little butter 
and fry the toast on both sides. Serve hot. 

FRIZZLED BEEF. 
Shred the dried beef into little pieces, carefully remov 
ing all fat, strings and sinews ; if the beef is very salt, fresh- 
en it by standing it in cold water for fifteen minutes, drain- 
ing after. Put one tablespoonful of butter in the saucepan ; 
when hot, put in the beef and fry it for five minutes, then 
add one tablespoonful of flour dissolved in one cup of cream 
or milk ; as soon as the flour is cooked, serve. 

STEWED KIDNEY. 
Cut the kidney into small pieces about the size of a 
cherry, put into a colander and let cold water run over it 



A FEW BREAKFAST DISHES. 1^9 

while in the colander, then put on a plate to drain ; put a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut in a pot, and sprinkle 
flour on the bottom of the pot, and stir the flour and butter 
together with a spoon until brown, then sprinkle flour on 
the kidney in the colander, stirring them together well, 
then put the kidney into the hot pot on the stove, stirring 
it until it is well mixed, then pour hot water on it two inches 
deep ; it must boil three hours to make it tender. Then 
take another piece of butter the same size, mix one table- 
spoonful of flour, pepper and salt with it to a paste, and 
stir it into the kidney, a little at a time and let it boil fifteen 
minutes ; while cooking it requires watching or it will burn. 

SAVORY MOLDS. 

Mince half a pound of underdone beef or mutton as 
finely as possible and put it into a basin with half its weight 
of bread crumbs, one ounce of butter broken into small 
pieces, a tablespoonful of finely minced onion, a teaspoonful 
of mixed powdered herbs and a good seasoning of salt and 
pepper. Mix these ingredients thoroughly, moisten with 
one beaten egg and fill in some small, well-buttered molds ; 
bake in a moderate oven for half an hour, and turn out 
carefully ; insert a small sprig of parsley in the top of each, 
and pour a little brown gravy round the meat. 

"MY DEVIL." 

One tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, three 
mustardspoonfuls of mustard, one saltspoonful of salt, one- 
half saltspoonful of black pepper, one-fourth saltspoonful of 
cayenne pepper, one teaspoonful of vinegar, a few drops of 
" Soy," one small teaspoonful of brown sugar, a squeeze of 
lemon, one glass of port wine. Mix all well together — fry 
the meat (turkey legs generally) in a frying pan with a little 
butter ; when almost ready, pour sauce over ; boil up and 
serve. 

PORK TENDERLOINS. 

Broil the tenderloins and serve with melted butter poured 
over them, a little salt and pepper ; serve very hot — very 
nice for breakfast. 



l8o THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CALCUTTA TOAST. 
Put one tablespoonful of butter into the saucepan over 
boiling water ; as it melts, stir in two eggs, a little cayenne, 
one-half teaspoonful of essence of anchovy and a few chopped 
capers ; stir until the eggs are cooked ; then spread the 
mixture on hot buttered toast. Serve hot. 

TOMATO TOAST. 
Boil one-half can of tomatoes or six fresh ones for fifteen 
minutes, then add one saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper, 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, one-half tablespoonful of 
flour mixed together ; when the mixture is thick and smooth, 
pour over some pieces of hot, buttered toast. Serve at once. 

VEAL SEFTON. 
Put one pint of strong, rich veal stock or gravy boiling 
hot, on to six fresh eggs, well beaten ; sprinkle in a little 
grated lemon peel, a dust of cayenne, salt and mace, then 
two ounces of melted butter. Bake slowly in buttered cups, 
turn out and serve with a good, rich gravy, or a tomato 
sauce. 

VIRGINIA WHITE PUDDINGS. 
One pint of fresh beef suet chopped fine and free from 
strings or skin, one pint of flour, one teacupful of corn meal, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper. Mix 
all well together, fill small cotton bags with this mixture, 
allowing a little space for the puddings to swell. Tie very 
tightly and boil for six hours, keeping the puddings well 
covered with water. When cold, hang in a cool, dry place ; 
when required for use, remove the bag and slice the pudding 
in thin slices and fry in a little butter. Serve very hot. 



iSi 



TRIPE. 



TO PREPARE TRIPE. 

When the tripe comes from the butchers, scrape it well, 
then put it on to boil in cold water ; as soon as it boils drain 
off the water and replace with more cold water — boil for 
four hours ; add to the water one onion, one teaspoonful of 
salt, a little cayenne, six pepper-corns and two cloves tied 
in a little bag, one bay leaf, one tablespoonful of vinegar ; 
when the tripe is cooked it is ready to be used for any of 
the various preparations of tripe. 

CREAMED TRIPE. 

Prepare the trip as directed. Cut the tripe into small 
pieces ; put one tablespoonful of butter into the stew-pan ; 
when it is hot add one tablespoonful of flour, stir together; 
when smooth add one teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, 
a little nutmeg, one-half pint of cream and the tripe, and 
cook for five minutes. 

TRIPE CUTLETS. 

Prepare the tripe as directed. Cut the tripe into pieces 
large enough for one portion ; dip each cutlet into beaten 
egg, then into fine bread crumbs — have the crumbs seasoned 
with salt and pepper, a little cayenne and a very little nut- 
meg, then into the egg again. Take one tablespoonful of 
butter, place in a pan ; when hot, put in the cutlets, brown 
and turn — they are cooked as soon as they are brown. Serve 
hot. 

FRIED TRIPE. 

Prepare the tripe as directed. Cut the tripe into small 
pieces, dip them in beaten egg, then into bread crumbs ; fry 
in deep hot fat. 



l82 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

TRIPE A LA MODE. 

Cook the tripe for four hours and let it cool ; take one 
slice of bacon, one onion, one garlic clove, one t&spoonful 
of butter, one-half teaspoonful of sugar ; fry together until 
brown, add one teacup of stock, boil once, then strain and 
add one teacup of tomatoes, one-half teaspoonful of salt. 
Take two teaspoonfuls of butter in the saucepan, when hot 
add one tablespoonful of flour, when smooth add the sauce, 
stirring all the time, then add the tripe which should be cut 
in small pieces two inches square ; cook lon^ enough to 
thoroughly season the tripe ; just before serving add one 
yolk of an egg, beaten with one tablespoonful of cream. 

TRIPE AND OYSTERS. 

One pound of tripe, one quart of oysters. Cut the 
tripe into inch pieces ; drain the oysters, cook the tripe in 
boiling water for five minutes ; put the oysters in a pan and 
let them just come to the boiling point, then drain them. 
Make a white sauce of two tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; when hot, add one cup of cream ; 
when smooth, add the tripe and oj'sters, seasoned with salt 
and pepper. 

TRIPE. 

It may not be generally known that stewed tripe is the 
most easily digested of all solid animal food ; it is fully 
digested in one hour after being eaten. 



FRYING. 183 



FRYING. 



In frying be sure that the pan is perfectly clean. To 
fry well the fat must always be very hot. To test this throw 
into the pan a bit of bread ; if it turns a light brown at 
once the fat is in a proper condition. 

Do not be afraid to put one or two pounds of fat into 
your frying pan ; it can be used over and over again, pro- 
vided it is strained each time. 

To Clarify Dripping — When 'poured from the meat pan 
it should be put into a bowl, pour into it some boiling water 
and a little salt, and stir well ; when it is cold remove from 
the bowl— the water and sediment will be at the bottom. 
Scrape the cake of dripping, put it into some more boiling 
water until it melts, then stir well and let it cool ; place in 
a crock and it will keep for weeks in cool weather. 

All the fats skimmed from boiled meats, soups, etc., 
should be treated in the same way and then added to the 
general crock. 

Fat for Frying — The light colored drippings of roast 
meat and the fat taken off from broths or beef suet chopped 
fine and melted down without browning. As soon as the 
bottom of the stew-pan can be seen through the suet is done. 

Olive oil of the best quality is tasteless, and is the best 
of all frying media. 

FRYING MIXTURE, 
mixture of one-half lard and one-half beef suet is a 
good frying medium, 

BEEF SUET DRIPPING. 
Prepare the dripping by putting into a ba-sin and pour- 
ing boiling water over it, stirring well to wash the suet from 
all impurities, then let it cool— all the impurities will settle 
with the water at the bottom of the basin ; when cold, place 



i 



184 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

on fire ; when hot, remove the dripping and put it away in 
a cool place. Beef dripping is preferable to other dripping 
for cooking. 

Frying once understood is a very easy process ; to have 
the operation successful the fat must be deep and very hot ; 
when the smoke comes from the center of the fat, a bit of 
bread thrown into it at this stage must color at once. The 
time for frying any article must be very short, two minutes 
being, in nearly every case quite enough. A kettle which 
has suspended from the handle a basket which can be filled 
with the articles to be fried and then let down into the fat 
is the best possible arrangement for frying. 

FRYING BATTER. 

Mix together in a bowl four tablespoonfuls of flour, one 
of olive oil, a saltspoonf ul of salt, the yolks of two eggs and 
enough cold water to make a stiff batter, about half a pint ; 
the batter should be stiff enough to hold on its surface the 
drops from the mixing spoon. Just before using the batter 
add to it the whites of the two eggs beaten to a stiff froth. 
This batter may be used with any kind of fruit, or with 
chopped oysters or clams, to make oyster and clam fritters. 

FRYING MEDIUM. 

Equal quantities of butter and beef suet make an ex- 
cellent frying medium. Boil the beef suet in plenty of hot 
water, strain, melt the butter, pour the suet and butter 
together and let them cool. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

TO RENDER LARD. 

Cut the fresh lard into small pieces, let it melt slowly 
over a moderate fire, as it melts pour it off and strain it into 
small crocks, — cover with oiled paper when cold.

cheese, one saltspoonful of dry mustard, a little cayenne. - 
Put butter into the chafing dish, when melted add the milk, 
crumbs, cheese and stir constantly, and just before serving 
add two well-beaten eggs. This fondue can be cooked on 
the stove as well. 

^ EGGS SCRAMBLED. 
Beat the eggs together a little ; add to six eggs, eight 
tablespoonfuls of ice- water, one saltspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper and one tablespoonful of butter ; melt the butter in 
the chafing dish ; when hot, put in the eggs mixed with

toast slightly buttered ; pour mixture on the toast, then 
sprinkle over the grated yolks. Garnish with bacon cut in 
ribbons, and crisped in hot spider. 

FISH DINNER. 

(so CALLED.) 

The following quantity of ingredients is supposed to be 
used for one person, doubled for two, etc., but I have found 
it too much ; however, you can easily judge for yourself : 
One cooked white potato, one cooked beet (same size), one 
hard-boiled egg, one tablespoonful of cooked codfish, either 
fresh or salt, small piece of cooked carrot, one cucumber 
pickle, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, according to taste, 
one-half tablespoonful of butter, one-half tablespoonful of 
flour ; mix together and stir well into the mixture one tea- 
spoonful of mixed mustard, 6ne-half saltspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, one saltspoonful of salt, provided fresh fish is used. 
Heat together in chafing dish.

flour and butter well together and stir into the boiling stock ; 
stir constantly until thick and smooth ; add the meat, salt 
and pepper and cook for five minutes, then remove from 
the fire or put out the lamp of the chafing dish and add the 
sherry. Cold chicken, turkey, game and veal are all very 
good treated in this manner.

Put the butter into the blazer with the onion, stew^ for 
about five minutes, then add the tomatoes and the gravy, 
sauce, mustard, salt and pepper ; when the mixture is 
smooth add the beef. As soon as the beef is hot it is ready 
to serve. Any rare cooked meat can be treated in the same 
way. 

LIVER. 

Slice a calf's liver one-fourth of an inch in thickness, 
dip each slice in flour, in which mix some salt and pepper 
and a little cayenne. Put in the chafing dish two table- 
spoonfuls of butter ; when hot,_put in the slices of liver, 
cook these for five minutes, then turn them, cook three 
minutes longer, then add one wine glass of sherry or port 
wine ; let this boil once, then serve. 

LOBSTER CREAMED. 

Have the meat of the lobster cut into small pieces. 
Put into the chafing dish one cup of cream ; rub together

ful of currant jelly (the lemon juice may be omitted). Stir 
this mixture until it is hot, then add the venison and cook 
for five or six minutes, — if wanted very rare, four minutes 
will answer ; add at the last two tablespoonfuls of port or 
sherry wine if desired. Slices of venison are very nice 
warmed in the chafing dish with the gravy left from the 
roast of a previous meal. 

WELSH RAREBIT. 
Melt one tablespoonful of butter in the chafing dish ; 
when hot add three teacupfuls of cheese (American) cut in

cover the pan and put it on the back part of the range, if 
the fire is very hot ; when the bread has risen very lightly, 
put it into the oven, removing the cover of the pan and let 
it brown ; it will take about fifteen minutes. Turn it out 
of the pan carefully. Serve hot.

of melted butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, one-half cake 
of compressed yeast. Heat the milk, but do not let it boil, 
pour it on the beaten egg, add melted butter, sugar, a little 
salt and flour enough to make a stiff sponge. Set in a warm 
place to rise ; when light knead in flour enough to make a 
stiff dough ; let rise again, then divide the dough into two 
parts and roll out separately ; spread over one-half of it 
some melted butter so that every atom of the surface is 
thoroughly greased, then lay the other half over the buttered 
one, and roll till an inch thick. Cut in small biscuits with 
a tin cutter (one-fourth pound baking powder box can be 
used), let rise ; when light, bake. Should be very light and 
puffy. Mix at nine in the morning if you want them for 
supper. Do not bake till after you begin to eat supper, so 
that they may be hotjp 

MILK BISCUITS— I. 
One pint of milk, with it it put one tablespoonful of 
butter, one tablespoonful of sugar ; heat these together, then 
add flour to make a batter like bread ; add one-half cake of

BREADS, BISCUITS, ETC. I95 

BUTTERED CAKES. 
One pound of flour, sift this into a basin, make a hollow 
in the center and mix in it one cake of compressed yeast 
dissolved in one-half teacup of warm milk, then put the 
sponge to rise in a warm place ; w^hen the sponge has risen 
to twice its original size, add one-half tablespoonful of 
sugar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, four tablespoonfuls of 
butter, and one-half teacup of milk ; mix these well into 
the sponge, and then add six eggs, mixing each egg sepa- 
rately, work these to a smooth paste and put it in a bowl, 
lightly covered, to rise for three hours in a warm place ; 
then sprinkle the pasteboard with flour, place the dough on 
it, divide into small portions, make into small cakes, place 
on the baking tins one and one-half inch space between 
each ; brush them over with egg and let them rise for one 
hour, then bake in hot oven ; when baked, split them open 
without separating entirely ; place a little butter in each, 
and serve hot. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES-i. 
One quart of buckwheat flour, one tablespoonful of 
wheat flour, mix these into a batter with one pint of luke- 
warm water ; dissolve one cake of compressed yeast in a 
little w^arm water and add to the batter (or one teacupful 
of home-made yeast can be used) ; add one teaspoonful of 
salt. Beat the batter well and put in a warm place to rise. 
Start the batter the noon before the cakes are needed, as it 
requires to rise several times and be stirred down each time 
to make really good cakes. Next morning if the batter is 
00 thick, thin it with a little warm water; add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream if convenient and two tablespoonfuls of 
molasses and one-half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a 
little warm water. Keep one cupful of the batter to start 
the next cakes with. In winter, batter can be kept for 
several weeks. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES-2. 
Two quarts of hot water, enough buckwheat flour to 
make with the water a stiff batter. Add one-half a cup of 
wheat flour to the buckwheat ; one saltspoonful of salt, dis- 
solve one cake of compressed yeast in a little water, add to 



196 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

the batter ; or one scant teacupf ul of home made yeast. Mix 
batter on the afternoon before the cakes are required for 
breakfast. Next morning add a spoonful of common mo- 
lasses, also a spoonful of melted butter and one-half tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in warm water. If the batter is 
too thick, thin it with either warm milk or water. 

BRIOCHE. 
Take of your bread sponge which is made of potatoes 
and no milk, as much sponge as w^hen flour is added, will 
make a lump the size of a large orange ; let this rise. 

Put eight eggs into a basin with one pound of butter, 
-ine teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar; beat all 
hese together until smooth, then add to the lump of dough 
as it has risen ; work these together for a long time, put to 
rise again, work it well, put to rise the second time and work 
it ; then the third time ; make into cakes like little pin-cush- 
ions and bake in a hot oven. If the cakes are for tea, do 
not add the eggs until noon ; keep the dough cool, add very 
little flour, as the secret is to keep the cakes very soft. The 
whole process takes seven hours. 

BUNS. 
One-half pound of flour in which work one-half pound 
of butter, then add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little salt, 
a little nutmeg. Boil one teacup of milk, in which dissolve 
one-third teaspoonful of soda, pour over the flour mixture, 
and then add two eggs well beaten, leaving out one white ; 
when the white is well mixed, grease a baking tin and drop 
on the buns with a spoon and bake in a'moderate oven.' 

ENGLISH BUNS. 
Mix one and one-half pints of sweet milk and one yeast 
cake, dissolve in half a cup of tepid water, with flour enough 
to make a thick batter. Set this mixture in a warm place 
and let it rise over night. In the morning add one cup of 
sugar, half a cup of melted butter, one saltspoonful of salt, 
half a nutmeg grated, and just enough flour to make a bat- 
ter that can be handled ; knead well and let the dough rise 
four or five hours. Roll it out to three-quarters of an 
inch thick, and cut into round cakes. Lay them in rows on 
a buttered biscuit pan, and when the buns have stood in the 



BREADS, BISCUITS, ETC. I97 

pans half an hour, make a cross with a knife upon the top 
of each one. Place the pans in a moderate oven and bake 
the buns a light brown. Beat the white of an egg stiff and 
add to the egg a little powdered sugar, and lightly cover the 
tops of the buns when they are taken from the oven. 

ENGLISH HOT CROSS BUNS. 
Sift into a large bowl one quart of flour, half a cup of 
sugar and one-half a teaspoonful of salt ; dissolve one-fourth 
of a cup of butter in a generous half pint of warm milk, and 
add to the dry ingredients, with the yolks of two beaten 
eggs ; add half a yeast cake dissolved in a little water, half 
a nutmeg grated and the whites of the two eggs beaten 
stiff; this should make a very soft dough; cover the bowl 
with a clean cloth, place it where it will keep warm, and 
let it rfse over night. In the morning take pieces of the 
dough the size of an egg, and with a little flour, mold them 
into round cakes an inch in thickness. Place them on a but- 
tered tin, leaving a little space between. Cover the tins and 
set in a warm place for the buns to rise ; they should be 
double their original size. With a sharp knife cut a cross 
in the center of each bun. Bake them in a moderate oven 
about a half hour. When the buns are baked brush the 
tops with a syrup made of sugar and water. 

BUNS FOR GOOD FRIDAY.

when very light, cut them into small buns ; brush the tops 
with a little mixed milk and molasses. Let the buns rise 
after they are made into small one. Bake twenty minutes. 

KARLSBADEN KIPFEL (Buns). 
One and one-eighth pounds of flour, one gill of sweet 
milk, one-half a yeast cake, dissolved in a little warm water ; 
make these into a sponge and let it rise ; when it has risen,

each ring one-half full. Bake until brown, then turn. 
When wanted, toast on both sides, butter nicely and serve 
on a hot plate. 

DROP FRITTERS. 
One pint of boiling milk, one pint of flour, three eggs, 
salt. Pour the boiling milk on the flour, beat until very

Drop by spoonfuls into hot deep fat and fry. 

GRIDDLE CAKES OF STALE BREAD. 
To one pint of stale bread crumbs add one quart of 
boiling milk, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Soak the prumbs in the milk, then beat 
the mixture until it is smooth, add the yolks of two eggs, 
then enough flour to make the batter stiff enough to bake, 
sift into the flour two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, then 
add the two whites beaten light. Have your griddle very 
hot and greased with a slice of salt pork. 

VIRGINIA HOE CAKE. 
Three eggs, one cup of corn meal, one pint of milk, 
wo tablespoonfuls of melted lard or butter, one teaspoonful 
of salt; mix these all well together, have your griddle hot, 
butter slightly ; bake the mixture in large cakes, turn and 
brown. In making hoe cake, beat the meal and milk 
together for at least ten minutes before adding the eggs, etc. 

LAPLAND CAKES. 
Lapland cakes are a peculiar, delicate, delicious cake of 
the popover kind. They are made with a much larger 
quantity of eggs than the ordinary wheat popovers. Beat 
the yolks of five eggs thoroughly with the patent egg-beater 
and stir them into a pint of sweet cream. Do not use a 
heavy cream for this purpose, but a light quality. Pour the 
mixture on a pint and a quarter of pastry flour sifted with 
half a teaspoonful of salt ; beat the batter well with a patent 
egg-beater and fold in carefully the whites of five eggs 
beaten to a stiff froth. Fill buttered cups of stoneware half 
full and bake the cakes three-quarters of an hour in a quick 
oven.

MUFFINS. 



One pint of milk, one-half cake of yeast, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, about three 
cups of flour. Scald the milk, add butter and salt. When 
luke warm, add yeast dissolved in one-fourth cup of 
luke warm water. Stir in enough flour to make a thick 
batter, cover well ; put in a warm place ; let rise two and 
one-half hours, then stir and put a big spoonful in greased 
muffin rings about half full. Turn when brown. Then 
split and toast and butter well — you can do this the next 
day, for the ones left. ^ 

RYE MEAL MUFFINS. 

Two cups of rye meal, one-half cup of molasses, one 
teaspoonful of salaratus dissolved in one cup of sour milk, 
one egg well beaten ; bake in muffin rings. 

QUICK WHEAT FLOUR MUFFINS.

milk, four whites of eggs, one teaspoonful of baking powder, 
two cups of flour, a little salt. Bake in muffin rings on the 
griddle, which has been rubbed with a little butter, -the 
griddle must be hot ; turn the muffins with cake turner. 

CORN MEAL MUSH. 

One quart of boiling water ; stir into this one and one- 
fourth pints of corn meal mixed smooth with one pint of 
cold w^ater, two tablespoonfuls of salt ; stir until the mush is 
well cooked. If required for fried mush, fill little cans 
(those that come with baking powder in them are very nice) , 
as the mush can then be cut in round slices for frying ; 
w^hen cold, slice ; dip each slice in bread crumbs and beaten 
egg and fry in deep, hot fat. 

ADIRONDACK PANCAKES. 

One quart of sour milk, add flour enough to make a thick 
batter. Let this stand twenty-four hours ; add then two 
eggs well beaten, a little salt, one-half teaspoonful of soda,

202 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

PAN-CAKES. 
One quart of sour milk, one-half teaspoonful of soda, 
one teaspoonful of salt, four eggs ; stir together, thicken 
with flour until a good batter is made, then stir in the yolks 
of the eggs well beaten, and then the whites beaten stiff, 
add the whites very carefully. For waffles, same batter, 
only add two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 

POPOVERS— I. 

Pastry flour is the most desirable, but the best bread 
flour will do. Sift two cups of flour with half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Add gradually two cups of milk, and when a 
smooth batter has been obtained mix in two eggs without 
separating the whites and yolks. Add a teaspoonful of 
butter, melted. Beat the batter thoroughly ; pour it at once 
into the cups of stoneware, well buttered. Do not fill the 
cups more than half full. Bake the cakes in a quick oven 
until, true to their name, they rise far above the edges of 
the cups and hang over them in a rich, brown crust. These 
cakes are nice for breakfast when served with either maple 
syrup or cream sauce ; or may be eaten like a muffin, with 
butter. They are often served as a plain dessert with 
sweetened cream. 

POPOVERS— 2. 

One pint of milk, one pint of flour, two eggs. Beat 

eggs separately and add milk and flour ; mix thoroughly and 

add one saltspoonful of salt. Bake in small pans, and fill

GRAHAM POPOVERS. 
Half a pint of sifted Graham flour, half a pint of sifted 
wheat flour, one tablespoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, and a teaspoonful of butter, melted. Beat the whites 
and yolks together and beat the batter vigorously with a 
patent egg-beater. Pour the batter into buttered cups of 
stoneware. They should rise, like all popovers, to four times 
their original size. If they are baked in an ordinary muffin 
pan or even in a heated iron gem pan, they' will not rise in 
this way. Wheat popovers are light and about double in 
bulk baked in gem pans ; in stone cups they are four times 
the bulk. 



BREADS, BISCUITS, ETC. 2O3 

RYE POPOVERS. 

Rye meal from which Boston brown bread is made, is 
used, not rye flour. Mix an even cup and a half of rye meal 
with an even cup of wheat flour; add a tablespoonful of 
sugar and half a teaspoonful of salt. Pour over these dry 
ingredients a pint of milk, mixing it to a smooth batter. 
Add three eggs, whites and yolks together. Beat the batter 
thoroughly and pour into a dozen stoneware cups well 
buttered. Bake the cakes in an oven that is very hot for 
the first twenty minutes ; then reduce the heat and bake 
them from twenty to thirty minutes longer. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 

Two quarts of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half 
cake of yeast, one-fourth teacup of sugar, one-half teacup 
of lard, one pint of milk. Boil the milk, melt it in the lard,

stir in the yeast, dissolved in a little water, then put in the 
milk after it is cool ; let it stand over night without mixing ; 
in the morning mix well and let it rise, and when light, 
work it together again ; when light, roll out the dough until 
one-half inch thick, cut into biscuits or rolls, fold together 
and let them rise again. 

STEPHAINE ROLLS.

and one-half pints more flour, teaspoonful of salt ; let rise 
again, roll out, bake one-half hour. 

RYE PUFFS FOR BREAKFAST. 

Add a cupful and a half of milk to one egg, whipped 
up in a tablespoonful of sugar ; stir in two cupfuls of rye 
flour, thoroughly mixed w^ith half a cupful of wheat flour. 
Into this flour put one and one-half teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, sifted, three times with the flour. Beat the batter 
hard for a minute before pouring it into the greased gem 
pans. Bake in a quick oven.

cup of white sugar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, a little cold 
water, add one-third cake of compressed yeast ; when the 
quart of water has cooled, add the potatoes, etc. Set in a 
cool place in summer, a warm place in winter. It will be 
ready for use in twenty-four hours. When fresh yeast is 
needed, and you already have some liquid yeast, one tea- 
cup of the liquid is used in place of the compressed yeast. 

YEAST— 2.

CAKES. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CAKE MAKING. 

All materials for cake must be of the very best. Before 
commencing, see that the oven is right for properly baking 
the cake — one very good test for the right heat, is to place 
in the mouth of the oven a little flour ; if it browns in five 
minutes, the heat is right. Another is to hold the bare 
hand without being inconvenienced in the oven for one 
second ; if the oven is too hot the cake will rise and then 
fall ; if a piece of white paper colors a light brown in five 
minutes after it is put in the oven, the oven is right for all 
rich cakes. Cake made without butter, or with very little 
butter, requires a hotter oven than a rich cake ; thin cakes 
require a hot oven. Never jar the oven while the cake is 
baking. Before commencing to mix the batter, have all 
the materials ready'; the pans greased, the flour sifted 
twice, the granulated sugar sifted, the eggs counted and 
separated. First cream the butter, and add to it the sugar 
gradually. When these are light add the yolks well 
beaten. Where there is not enough butter to make the 
mixture creamy, add a part of the yolks, and after, the 
balance. Then add the milk, then the flour, measured after 
sifting, and in it sift the baking powder, then add the 
flavoring and one saltspoonful of salt ; lastly the whites 
beaten until stiflF. These should be folded into the batter. 
In mixing cake an upward beating motion is better than 
stirring, as more air is introduced into the mixture. If the 
cake is not to be iced, a thin sprinkle of powdered sugar 
over the batter, just before baking, and when in tins will 
give a smooth surface. Sponge cake should have coarse 
granulated sugar sprinkled over the batter. To know if 
the cake is done stick a broom straw into the cake, if it 
comes out clean, the cake is done. All fruit should be 
lightly floured, and stirred into the batter at the last.

MEASUREMENTS. 

Exactness in measuring is absolutely necessary. 

When a receipt calls for a "cupful of anything," it 
means one-half a pint, tin measures holding just this 
amount can be purchased at any house furnishing store. 

Loaf cakes require about an hour to bake. Layer 
cakes and small cakes about twenty-five minutes. 

ALMOND CAKE. 

ONE HOUR TO BAKE. 

One pound of flour, one pound of sugar, one pound of 
seeded raisins chopped, three-fourth pound of butter, one 
cup of thin sour cream, four eggs, one nutmeg, rind and 
juice of one lemon, one tpaspoonful of cloves, oneteaspoon- 
ful of soda, one wine glass of wine or brandy, one cup of 
almonds blanched and chopped fine, Beat butter and sugar 
together, add the milk eggs beaten separately, spices, 
lemon, cream, soda, dissolved in a little w^arm water; the 
wine, flour and almonds. Bake in three tins ; when baked, 
ice with the following mixture : Two eggs, whites only, 
the juice of one lemon, one cocoanut grated, one pound of 
raisins, one cup of blanched and chopped almonds ; beat 
the eggs with one-half teacup of sugar, add the lemon juice 
then add a little more sugar — just enough to enable you to 
spread the mixture on the cakes ; then put on this frosting 
the grated cocoanut, then a layer of the raisins, put the 
raisins into boiling water a minute before using them ; 
then a layer of the almonds, then a layer of the frosting. 

ANGEL CAKE. 

ONE HOUR TO BAKE. 

Beat the whites of eleven eggs to a stiff froth ; sift into 
them a little at a time, ten ounces, or one and one-half 
tumblers of powdered sugar, mixing carefully and lightly 
then sift five ounces, or one tumbler of flour four times, add 
a level teaspoonful of cream of tartar to the flour, sift it 
again, and then sift into the eggs and sugar a little at a 
time, mixing it carefully and lightly ; when all the flour is 
used, add a teaspoonful of vanilla essence to the cake and 
put it into a new tin cake pan or mold, not buttered or 
lined. Bake it in a moderate oven about three-quarters of 



CAKES. 209 

an hour, testing it with a broom straw ; when the straw 
comes out clean, the cake is done. Let the cake cool 
gradually in the mouth of the oven with the door open. 
When the cake is quite cold loosen it from the sides of the 
pan with a knife and turn it out. The success of this de- 
licious depends upon preserving its lightness. If the 
eggs are beaten quite stiff, and the flour and sugar very 
carefully sifted and stirred in, it will be light. Do not 
open the oven for fifteen minutes after the cake has been 
put into it. 

BLACK CAKE. 

Bake Black Cake in a porcelain baking dish, if possible. 
The cake baked in a tin often becomes very dry and hard 
outside, from the long time necessary to properly bake it.

bread; when very stale, another slice; this will keep the 
black cake fresh and moist. 

BLACK CAKE-i.

mon, molasses, one nutmeg. Bake three hours. 

Mix the butter and sugar together until light, then add 
the yolks of the eggs beaten light, then the flour, then the 
whites beaten very stiff, then the fruit (retain a little of the 
flour to sprinkle over the fruit), then the spice and 
liquor. 

BLACK CAKE-2. 

Five pounds of raisins stoned, three pounds of currants, 
two pounds of citron chopped fine, one pound of butter, one 
pound of sugar, one pound of flour, ten eggs, two ounces of

mace, two glasses of whiskey, two glasses of wine. This 
recipe makes three loaves ; bake four hours. Mix the butter 
and sugar together until light, then add the yolks of the 
eggs beaten light, then the flour, then the whites beaten

One-half cup of butter, one and one-half cups of sugar, 
four cups of flour, one cup of milk, two eggs, one teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus, two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, two cups 
of berries. Mix butter and sugar together, add the eggs

of cold water aften ten minutes' fast boiling, drop into it a 
little of the syrup, if it will roll into a solt ball between 
your thumb and finger it is done, take from the fire and let 
the syrup cool. When cool, beat it hard with a wooden 



226 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

Spoon until it is a soft, creamy mass. Should the fondant 
bcome sugary, return it to the fire and add a few spoonfuls 
of cold water and proceed as before. Keep the fondant in 
a jar until required. When needed, place the jar in a sauce 
pan half filled with boiling water and stir the fondant until 
it is soft, then spread or pour it over the cake or cakes. 
The fondant can be made any desired color by the colorings 
sold for the purpose, and flavored as desired.

ICE CREAM, ICES, MOUSSE. 



Always have the mixture to be frozen, cold before 
putting into the freezer ; the ice crushed fine and one-third 
as much salt as ice ; when the freezer is well packed in salt 
and ice, pour in a pint of water — this fills in the spaces left 
by the ice and salt, and helps the melting of the ice. Salt 
water at the freezing point is colder than fresh water at the 
same point. A mistake is often made in turning the dasher 
too rapidly ; the cream will not freeze until the ice around 
begins to melt ; use plenty of rock salt, turn the crank 
slowly, and the cream will be frozen in about twenty 
minutes.

PASTRY, PIES, AND PUDDINGS. 



Pastry can be made with any good flour, though 
"pastry flour" is more apt to be successful. 

A VERY GOOD PASTRY. 

One and one-half cup of flour, one-fourth cup of lard, 
one-fourth cup of butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, ice 
water. Wash the butter, dry in a clean napkin, pat into a 
circular piece, add the salt to the flour, then rub into the 
flour the lard. It is better to cut the lard into the- flour 
with a knife, moisten the flour to a thick dough with the 
ice-water, place the paste on the board, which sprinkle very 
lightly with flour, roll out the paste, then place on the 
butter and roll it out, fold the paste over, so as to make 
three layers ; turn for three half rounds, pat again, roll out ; 
repeat this three times. To place the butter, put it on the 
lower half of the paste, fold over, press the edges together 
with finger, so as to keep in the air ; turn one side over the 
butter, then the other under. Always roll out from you. 

PUFF PASTE— I. 

Puff paste should be made in a cool place always. 
Take equal quantities of pastry flour and butter. Wash 
the butter well in ice water, work it into smooth ball. 
Mix into the flour one teaspoonful of salt to a pound of 
flour. Make a paste with ice water, work until perfectly 
smooth and stiff, let it rest five minutes. Roll the paste 
out, put the butter on it, fold the paste about the butter 
and roll it out to one-half an inch in thickness, then fold 
over twice, it will then be in four thicknesses ; repeat this 
five times ; let the paste rest each time, five minutes be- 
tween. 



fASTRY, PIES, AND PUDDINGS. 233 

PUFF PASTE— 2. 

One pound of flour, one pound of butter, scant one- 
half pint of ice water, one saltspoonful of salt. Mix the 
flour into dough with the ice water and salt ; reserve a little 
flour for the rolling out of the butter. Knead the dough 
well, and then make it into a ball, which pound with the 
rolling-pin until it is full of blisters, then put the dough on 
the ice for fifteen minutes. Wash the butter in cold water, 
wring it out in a clean napkin until dry, then put it on the 
ice for fifteen minutes. Take the dough, roll it out to one- 
half an inch in thickness ; take one-fourth of the butter, 
spread it on one-half of the dough, sprinkle just a little 
flour on it to prevent the rolling-pin from sticking to it, 
fold over the other half and roll it ; fold four times, using 
all the butter — let the paste rest fifteen minutes between 
each rolling, then put the paste on the ice to become very 
cold. In winter this is accomplished quickly and well by 
putting the paste out of doors covered; when the paste is 
required, handle it as little as possible, roll it to the re- 
quired thickness at once ; the paste will be lighter and more 
delicate if this is observed ; bear as lightly as possible on the 
rolling-pin. 

BEEF DRIPPING PASTRY. 

Take one pound of flour and one-half pound of beef 
dripping, prepared as directed ; one-half pint of cold water. 
Mix the flour and water into a smooth paste, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt ; roll it out three times, each time place on 
the paste one-third of the dripping in small pieces, roll the 
dripping lightly into the paste — if desired for a fruit pie 
crust, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

BEEF SUET PASTRY. 

One-half pound of beef suet, one pound of flour, one- 
half pint of cold water ; take all the skin and shreds from 
the suet, chop it very fine, and rub it well into the flour 
with one teaspoonful of salt, work it all to a smooth paste 
with the water; roll it out to the thickness desired and it 
is ready to use. 



234 ''""^ 3"^'5 COOK BOOK. 

FLEAD PASTRY. 
One pound of flour, three-fourths pound of fresh flead, 
one-half pint of water, one saltspoonful of salt. Take off 
the skin from the flead, cut the flead into thin flakes, rub it 
into the flour, add the salt and water, work all into a 
smooth paste, fold it three times, then beat it well with the 
rolling-pin, roll it out and it is ready for use. This crust 
is very light and makes and excellent crust for apple pies, 
or small tarts. 

A FINE PIE CRUST. 
One pound of flour, one-half pound of butter ; rub the 
flour and butter together while dry — add enough ice water 
to make a dough ; do not knead the dough, but roll it out 
with the rolling-pin four times. Let it stand two hours at 
least before baking. This will be crust enough for four 
pies with top crusts. 

PIE CRUST FOR ONE PIE. 
One coffeecup of sifted flour, one-half coffeecup of lard 
or drippings, rubbed together with one-half teaspoonful of 
salt ; cold water to moisten ; do not make the paste wet ; 
roll out quickly.

APPLE MERINGUE. 
Stew some apples until soft, add one cup of sugar, a 
little salt and a little nutmeg, strain through a colander ; 
when cold, fill the pie tins, which must be lined with pastry, 
and bake; as soon as the pie crust is baked, remove from 
oven. Whip the whites of three eggs until stiff, add three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and put over the pie ; bake for a 
few moments, or until the meringue is firm. 

APPLE PIE- 1. 
Slice the apples in thin slices, cover the pie tin or plate

minutes. 

APPLE PIE-2. 

Line a deep pie dish with pastry, cut the apples in thin 
slices, sprinkle them well with sugar, a little nutmeg, salt- 
spoonful of salt, and one tablespoonful of butter broken into

Make some good puff paste ; line some patty tins, 
grate one cocoanut ; to one-half pound of the cocoanut add 
one-half pound of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of water or the 
milk from the nut, if it is absolutely fresh and sweet ; stew 
the cocoanut for an hour or until it is tender, then cool it ; 
when it is cool, add one teaspoonful of brandy, three eggs 
well beaten, and the rind and juice of one lemon. Fill the 
patty tins with the mixture and bake for fifteen minutes.

ripe cherries stoned ; sprinkle over them a cupful of sugar, 
a few bits of butter and a teaspoonful of flour. Cover with 
the upper crust, and bake. 

CHERRY PIE-2. 

Fill a deep pie dish with cherries which have not been 
stoned, sprinkle thickly with sugar and little bits of butter. 
Cover with a good pastry, and bake.

one tablespoonf ul more butter ; roll one layer of dough to 
about one-half inch in thickness, spread it lightly with 
melted butter, then roll the remaining half of the dough to 
the same thickness, place over the first and bake ; the two 
layers will come apart when baked. If fresh peaches are 
used, take one. quart of peaches, peel and cut fine, and one 
cup of sugar ; let the fruit stand in the sugar for an hour 
before using, then spread the fruit on the crust, placing the 
upper crust on the peaches and keep warm. Serve with 
cream. If canned peaches are used, the syrup will make a 
sauce for the shortcake ; if it is not sweet enough, boil the 
syrup with one-half cup of sugar and serve. 

POTATO PIE. 

One pint of mashed potatoes, three eggs, one pint of 
sugar, one-half cup of butter, one-half teacup of cream, one 
lemon, one tablespoonful of brandy. Mix together and 
bake. Have pie tins lined with good pastry.

two sheets, lay one smoothly upon the other with a few bits 
of butter between them, and when done pull apart, waiting 
till they have slightly cooled. Cover the lower layer with 
a thick coating of strawberries and sprinkle liberally with 
powdered sugar ; lay on the upper crust and send to table 
whole, to be eaten with thick, rich, sweetened cream. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE— 2. 
Make the crust the same as for peach shortcake. Hull 
the berries. For one quart add one cup of sugar, crush the 



PASTRY, PIES, AND PUDDINGS. 34I 

berries and let them stand in tiie sugar for an hour ; just 
before spreading the fruit on the shortcake, add one-half 
teacup of cream to the berries ; if another layer is liked on 
the top of the shortcake, use for this layer the berries with- 
out any cream mixed with them. 

Stewed prunes, apricots and apples all make a very 
good shortcake, made in the same manner as peach short- 
cake. 

VOL-AU-VENT. 

Make some puff paste with one pound of flour, one 
pound of butter, one-fourth teaspoonf ul of salt. See direc- 
tions for making puff paste. Roll out the pastry to one inch 
in thickness ; cut in the size of the plate in which the vol- 
au-vent is to be served ; brush over the top with beaten 
egg; make a circular incision one-fourth of an inch deep, 
one inch from the edge of the pastry. Bake the pastry ; 
when cooked, remove the cover which will have risen during 
the baking; fill the vol-au-vent with creamed chicken, 
sweetbreads, lobsters, stewed fruit, whipped cream, or 
other articles desired. 

VOL-AU-VENT OR PATTY CASES. 

Have two round pastry cutters, one a little more than 
half the size of the other — these cutters can be purchased 
in sets. Roll out the puff paste to one-half inch in thick- 
ness ; with the largest cutter, cut the number of patties 
required, then with the small cutter, cut the same number 
of cases ; put these on top of the large onces, then cut with 
the smaller cutter nearly through one-half of the patties, 
put them together; when baked, remove this round of 
crust — it will come easily ; and fill the cases and place the 
little cover over. 

ALBERRY PUDDING. 
Peel four bananas, slice them ; peel six oranges, cut the 
pulp out free from the white part. Put these in layers in 
a glass dish and sprinkle over lemon juice. Boil together 
one and a half cup of sugar and one-half cup of water until 
a rich syrup is made. While hot, pour this syrup over the 
fruit, place on ice to become very cold before serving.

of the eggs beaten until stiff ; pour this over the apples and 
bake for five or six minutes. 

APPLE FRITTERS. 
Pare three apples ; slice them half an inch thick, remove 
the cores, and lay the slices for an hour in the following 
mixture, turning them over every fifteen minutes. Mix 
together two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful of 
ground spice, one glass of wine, and pour upon the apples. 
At the end of an hour dip the slices into a batter. (See 
recipe for frying batter.) Lift each one out on a fork, and 
fry the fritters a golden brown in smoking hot fat, laying 
them for a minute on brown paper to free them from grease. 
Arrange them on a dish in a circle, and dust them with 
powdered sugar. 

APPLE DUMPLING. 
Same as Damson Plum — only substituing apples for 
plums. 

APRICOT EGGS. 
One sponge cake, baked in a round tin, cut it into 
slices about one-half an inch thick, cut these into rounds 
with a biscuit cutter. Spread over each round of cake a

apricot, dust over some fine sugar. These eggs are rapidly 
made, look pretty, and though an old-fashioned dessert are 
quite good. 

APRICOT MUSCOVITE. 
One pound of apricot jam or apricot preserves, made 
very smooth by passing through a sieve, if not sweet enough 
add some sugar. Make a custard with the yolks of four 
eggs and one scant pint of fresh milk; boil the milk, stir 
in the eggs and one cup of sugar. When thick, remove 
from fire and add one-half ounce of gelatine, which should 
have been soaked in warm water and strained. Whip 
these together, and as soon as the mixture sets add one-half 
pint of stiffly whipped cream and one small glass of either 
noyeau or apricot brandy or plain brandy. Place the 
mixture in a mold, put it into a pail, cover with ice and salt, 
and let remain for two hours. Any jam can be used in 
place of apricot.

One coff'ee cup of tapioca soaked for some hours in cold 
water ; eight apples pared and cut in pieces, one cup of 
sugar. Put a layer of apples, then a layer of tapioca, sugar 
and the juice of one lemon, until the dish is full, then put in 
as much water as the dish will hold ; bake for an hour ; if 
the mixture seems too stiff add more water ; it should look 
clear and brown when done. Serve with cream. 

BAVARIAN CREAM. 
One quart of cream, five ounces of sugar, one ounce 
gelatine, two teaspoonfuls vanilla, four eggs (yolks), a little 
pinch of salt. Make a custard by taking one pint of the 
cream, and the sugar and salt ; when boiling hot, stir in the

one pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of flour, a pinch "of 
salt. Put the flour into a basin, add enough milk to moisten 
it ; carefully rub down all the lumps, stir in the melted 
butter, keep beating the mixture hard, add the eggs 
beaten together ; then add the salt. Butter a pudding mold, 
fill with the batter, tie down the cover tightly, put it into 
boiling water, move the mold a few times at first to prevent 
the pudding from settling, then boil for one hour and fifteen 
minutes. Serve at once when removed from the fire and 
serve with the pudding a fruit sauce or sugar and cream. 

BREAD PUDDING— I. 
Boil one teacup of bread crumbs in one pint of milk 
with a slice of lemon peel and one teaspoonful of butter ; 
boil for ten minutes, then mash through a sieve, add two 
well beaten eggs, one teacup of powdered sugar, one salt-

Put three-quarters of a pound of bread crumbs into a 
bowl vfith six ounces or six tablespoonfuls of sugar, two of 
butter, a saltspoonful of salt, and a pint of boiling milk, 
and let them stand for ten minutes ; then add the yolks of 
six eggs beaten to a cream and the whites whipped to a 
froth ; pour the pudding into a buttered mold, and steam it 
it one hour in a large saucepan containing boiling water 
enough to reach half way to the top of the mold. Turn the 
pudding from the mold and serve it with cream sauce. 

BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. 

Fill the pudding dish with slices of thinly cut bread, 
buttered, and strew over each slice some currants. Make 
a custard of one pint of milk, two tablespoonfuls of sugar,

ful of nutmeg. Mix these well together and pour over the 
bread and butter, and bake in a moderate oven for thirty 
minutes. 

BREAD TARTS. 
Cut slices of bread, one quarter of an inch thick ; cut 
these with the biscuit cutter into circles ; moisten them with 
a little milk, then spread over some jam or preserves ; put 
the circles together as sandwiches, and then fry them in 
a little butter on each side until they are browned. Serve 
with cream or with a pudding sauce or without any sauce. 

BRIGHTON PUDDING. 

One pint of milk, three eggs, one-half teacup of butter,

PRESERVES, ETC. 



All preserves and canned fruits should be kept in a cool 
dark, dry place. Always add. a little salt to apples when 
cooking them, salt improves and brings out the flavor of 
the apples and not so much sugar is required. 

BAKED APPLES WITH BUTTER. 
Pare eight good cooking apples and remove the cores 
— it is better to take out the core of an apple before peeling 
it ; fill the cavities with butter, place the apples in a pan ; 
sprinkle over the apples one cup of sugar, and one teaspoon- 
ful of cinnamon ; put two tablespoon fuls of water in the 
pan, and bake the apples in a slow oven until they are ten- 
der, then remove from the oven, put them in the dish in 
which they are to be served ; strain the syrup over them. 

FRIED APPLES. 
Slice the apples ; have the frying pan hot ; put in one 
tablespoonful of butter, then the apples, sprinkle a little 
sugar among the apples ; fry slowly until a good brown. 

APPLE JELLY. 
Pare the apples, cut them in pieces, place in the pre- 
serving kettle with a very little cold water, boil slowly 
until the fruit is soft, skim, then strain through a jelly bag ; 
weigh the juice and for each pound of juice allow three- 
fourths of a pound of sugar, unless the apples were very acid, 
then one pound of sugar will not be too much ; boil for 
fifteen minutes, skim, and then stir the sugar into the juice ; 
skim carefully ; cook until the sugar is dissolved, or until 
the juice jellies upon the spoon ; then pour into glasses ; 
cover these the next day with papers wet in alcohol, and 
paste over these another paper. One tablespoonful of 
lemon juice may be added if desired. 



PRESERVES, ETC. 263 

APPLE MARMALADE. 
Prepare in the same manner as peach marmalade, 
omitting the lemon juice. 

APPLES STEWED. 
Eight firm, large sour apples; pare, core and rub them 
over with lemon juice ; then cook them in a syrup made 
with one cup of sugar, one pint of water, two cloves. 
Stew the apples very slowly so that they will retain their 
shape ; when they are soft, put them into a glass dish and 
strain the syrup over them ; to be served cold. 

ASPIC OR SAVORY JELLY. 

Two calf's feet, three pounds of the knuckle of veal, 
three-fourths of a pound of lean ham, two onions, three 
carrots, one bunch of herbs, one blade of mace, twelve 
pepper-corns, one bunch of sweet herbs, four quarts of 
water ; boil these together until the liquor is reduced to two 
quarts ; skim and strain ; when cold skim off all the fat, put 
the jelly back into the stewpan, stir in the whites of two 
eggs well beaten, stir until the broth boils, then let it simmer 
slowly for fifteen minutes ; strain through a jelly bag into a 
mold. 

French cooks flavor with one tablespoonful of tarragon 
vinegar. 

BLACKBERRY JAM. 
Pick over the berries carefully ; to every pint of berries 
allow three-fourths pint of sugar, mash together and then 
place in the preserving kettle and let all boil slowly until 
the syrup thickens ; skim the jam and put into jars ; the next 
day cover with papers wet in alcohol, and another cover of 
stiff paper pasted on with the white of egg slightly beaten. 

BLACK CURRANT JELLY FOR GAME. 
Mash the currants and boil them in a very little water, 
just enough to prevent their burning, then strain the juice, 
and to every pound of juice add one pound of sugar; boil 
the juice for ten minutes, 'skim and add the sugar, stir until 
dissolved. Pour into glasses and cover these when cold, 
with papers dipped in alcohol. 



264 TI-IB 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Make the jelly when the fruit is just turning red— the 
jelly will be firmer and of a better color than it will be 
made from very ripe currants. Strip the currants from 
their stems, wash them and put into the preserving kettle, 
stir until the juice starts from them freely, then strain the 
juice through the jelly bag, weigh the juice and to every 
pound allow one pound of sugar, boil the juice for twenty 
minutes, skim carefully, then add the sugar, which should 
be hot ; stir until the sugar is dissolved, skim and pour into 
jelly glasses, cover these next day with paper wet in 
alcohol, and an outside paper tied or pasted over. If the 
currants are not too ripe the jelly will be firm without longer 
boiling. Test the juice on a saucer ; if it jellies quickly it is 
cooked enough. 

WHIPPED CURRANT JELLY. 

TO SERVE WITH GAME. 

One hour before dinner take a glass of currant jelly 
and whip it with an egg ; whip until it is all foamy. Whip 
the whites of two eggs until very stiff, add to them two 
tablespoonfuls of fine sugar, fold them into the jelly and 
heap on a glass dish, putting a little granulated sugar over. 
Any tart jelly can be used in this way. 

WHIPPED CRANBERRY JELLY. 

TO SERVE WITH ROAST TURKEY. 

Prepare the cranberries, removing all skins as recipe 
given, and proceed as for whipped currant jelly. 

PRESERVED SOUR CHERRIES. 

A pound of sugar to a pound of cherries, stoned. Take 
one-half the weight of the sugar to make a syrup, scald that 
syrup and pour it over the cherries and let it stand until the 
next morning, continue to do this for eight mornings, the 
ninth morning put in the other half of the sugar and scald 
it ; when boiling put in the cherries and let them scald, then 
seal In glass jars. 



PRESERVES, ETC. 365 

CRAB APPLE JELLY. 
Put the crab-apples into the kettle with not quite 
enough water to cover them, let them simmer until soft ; 
strain through a sieve. Take the pulp and strain it through 
a cheese cloth bag, then strain all the juice through a ilannel 
bag. To the juice allow three pints of sugar to four pints 
of juice ; boil the juice twenty minutes before adding the 
sugar ; boil together until the juice will thicken on a spoon 
when tested. Fill the jelly glasses, dip them in warm 
water before filling. When the jelly is cold put a thin 
paper on the top of each glass, dipped in alcohol, and paste 
over the top of the glass a paper which can be pasted tightly 
over by using the beaten white of egg for the paste. 

BRANDIED CHERRIES. 
Pick the cherries on a dry, clear day ; fill wide mouthed, 
glass jars with the fruit, and then pour in as much good, 
pale brandy as the jars w^ill hold. Cover closely and place 
in a cool, dry place for four weeks. Then pour off the 
liquor ; add to each pint three-quarters of a pound of white 
sugar ; boil these together until a thick syrup is obtained, 
strain it and pour it over the cherries, then boil all together 
for five minutes ; return to the bottles and. cover tightly. 

GRAPE JUICE. 
Take only fresh ripe grapes, the Concord grapes make 
the richest juice, though other grapes may be used. Free 
the grapes from the stems, use no sugar ; put on the fire ; 
as soon as the grapes are soft strain them through a jelly 
bag of flannel or cheese cloth ; when strained, put back on 
the fire, and when boiling once more, bottle and seal or put 
into glass jars and seal, 

FRUIT JAM. 
Mix strawberries and pineapple. To every bowlful of 
strawberries put one-half a bowlful of pineapple shredded 
fine, — to each pound of, mixed fruit put three-fourth pounds 
of sugar. Boil for two hours and seal while hot. 

PEAR PRESERVES. 
Four pounds of hard pears, four pounds of sugar, one- 
fourth pound of preserved ginger, four lemons, one pint of 



266 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

water. Pare and cut the pears into very thin slices, chop 
the ginger fine. Place pears, ginger, sugar, lemon peel 
and water into the preserving kettle and boil until the fruit 
is transparent, adding the lemon juice at the end. Seal 
while hot. 

DAMSON PLUM JAM. 

Stone the plums, which should be fresh and ripe, boil 
them for forty minutes in the preserving kettle, skim care- 
fully, then add three-fourths of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of plums, boil for fifteen minutes, then put into 
small glasses or jam pots ; cover when cold with papers 
dipped in alcohol, and outside of these paste a stiff paper. 

Green gage plums are prepared in the same way. 

BRANDY PLUMS. 

Ten quarts of plums, seven pounds of sugar, to every 
pound a half pint of water^ when melted, put in the plums, 
having stuck them all with d. pin. Throw them into cold 
water, then back into the syrup and let them stand until 
tender (do not boil). Strain the syrup, then let Gool, when 
cold put your plums into jars, and to every half pint of 
syrup put one-half pint of brandy ; bottle. 

PEACH MARMALADE. 

Pare, cut in pieces and weigh the peaches ; for every 
pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Cook the peaches 
in a very little water for three-fourths of an hour, skim 
carefully and then add the sugar; crack a number of the 
stones and put the kernels into the marmalade, add one 
tablespoonful of lemon juice ; boil all together for ten 
minutes, then put into small glasses; cover the next day 
with papers dipped in alcohol, and paste an outside paper 
over. It is an improvement, after the peaches are tender 
and before the sugar is added, if the fruit is pressed through 
a sieve and then returned to the fire. 

PLUM MARMALADE. 

Prepare in the same manner as peach marmalade, only 
omitting the lemon juice. 



PRESERVES, ETC. 367 

PINEAPPLE MARMALADE. 

Peel the pineapples, carefully removing all the dark 
specks, then grate the fruit on a coarse grater, and put it 
into the preserving kettle, allowing to each pound of fruit 
a scant pound of sugar. Boil sugar and fruit together until 
the fruit is clear, skim and then put into small glasses or 
jam pots. Cover when cold with papers dipped in alcohol, 
and over this paste stiff white paper. 

QUINCE AND APPLE MARMALADE. 

Peel, cut in pieces, equal quantities of apples and 
quinces, and follow the directions for peach marmalade, 
omitting the lemon juice ; add one-half teaspoonful of salt. 
Be careful to remove the hard parts of the quince around 
the cores, and cook the quinces first in water until tender 
before adding the apples. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Peel the peaches, remove the stones, then weigh the 
fruit ; to every pound of peaches put one-fourth pound of 
sugar, place all in the preserving kettle with a little water ; 
let the fruit boil for ten minutes, skim carefully. Place in 
jars, and fill the jars very full. Screw on the covers as soon 
as the fruit is put in the jars. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Peel the peaches, cut in halves, remove the stones, 
weigh the peaches. For every pound of fruit allow one 
pound of sugar ; place the sugar and peaches in the pre- 
serving kettle with just a little water; crack some of the 
stones and put the meats with the fruit ; stew slowly and 
skim often ; when the peaches are clear remove them to a 
platter; let the syrup boil until thick, then strain it over 
the peaches ; when cold, place in glasses or jars, and cover 
with papers dipped in alco'hol. 

BAKED PIE PLANT. 

Cut the pie plant into pieces about an inch long, put 
in a baking dish with an equal weight of sugar, cover 
closely and bake about one hour. 



268 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

QUINCE JELLY. 
Quarter and core the ripe quinces, throw them into 
cold water until all are prepared ; weigh, and allow one 
pint of water to each pound of fruit, simmer the fruit until 
it is very soft, be careful it does not burn, then strain 
through a jelly bag, do not squeese the bag; weigh the 
juice, put it in a preserving kettle, and boil rapidly for 
twenty minutes ; skim, then stir into it one pound of sugar 
to each pound of juice. If the fruit is very sweet three- 
fourths of a pound will answer. Boil for twenty or thirty 
minutes, stir constantly and skim carefully until the juice 
jellies in falling from the spoon ; then pour into jelly 
glasses, cover the next day with paper wet in alcohol, and 
then paper pasted over the tops. 

QUINCES PRESERVED IN SLICES. 
Pare and core and cut into thin slices the ripe quinces ; 
throw the slices into cold water until all are prepared. For 
every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a pound of 
white sugar. Put the quince slices into the preserving kettle 
with a very little water, cook the fruit for ten minutes, then 
add the sugar, which has been dissolved in as little water as 
possible. Cook together until the slices of fruit are soft and 
clear. When clear, put into glasses and the next day cover 
with papers wet in alcohol and covered with dry papers. 

EAST INDIA PRESERVES. 
One-half bushel of green tomatoes ; after washing and 
slicing them into round, rather thick slices, put them into a 
porcelain kettle and boil until they are a light, transparent 
green color. Drain off the water and measure the tomatoes ; 
take to each pound of tomatoes, one pound of sugar, three 
lemons cut into slices, five cents' worth of ginger root broken 
into small pieces ; boil all these well together until the 
mixture is very thick — but the pieces should keep their 
forms — remove from the fire. In four days boil the mixture 
again if it is not thick enough. This preserve need not be 
sealed in jars. 

SPICED TUTTI-FRUTTI PRESERVES. 
Scald twelve pounds of currants, rub them through a 
sieve to remove all seeds and stems ; after this add to the

Put the prunes into a saucepan with sufficient water to cover 
them, add the sugar and the peel of the lemon, stew gently 
two hours, pass through a wire sieve, add the gelatine, 
having previously soaked it in water. Crack the prune 
stones and put the kernels into the jelly ; boil all together 
for a few minutes and pour into a china mold which is the 
shape of a ring. Whip the cream and heap it up high in 
the center of the mold, and serve. 

WINE JELLY- 1. 
One box of gelatine, soak this in one pint of cold water 
for . two hours, then add one quart of boiling water, one 
and three- fourths pounds of sugar, the juice of two lemons

which has an open center ; this center can be filled with 
w^hipped cream when ready to serve. 

RASPBERRY JELLY. 
To each pound of raspberry juice add one pound of 
sugar. Prepare the juice in the same manner as for currant 
jelly. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 
Select ripe, fresh fruit ; to each pound of fruit allow

and boil together until the jam is clear, thick, and smooth- 
remove all the scum as it rises, When cooked put into jelly 
glasses; cover when cold with papers dipped in alcohol, and 
on the outside put papers either pasted or tied down. 

ST'RAWBERRY JAM. 
Prepare in the same way as for raspberry jam. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. 
Take the hulls from the berries ; if possible avoid wash- 
ing the berries — if it is necessary to do so be as expiditious 
as possible. Take one pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit ; place the berries in preserving kettle, let them come 
to the boiling point slowly; boil for fifteen minutes, care- 
fully skim them, then place in small jars or tumblers; the 
next day cover with a paper wet in alcohol, and outside of 
this a white paper pasted down over the tops with a paste 
made of the white of an egg slightly beaten. 

TO STERILIZE FRESH FRUITS. 
Fill the jars with the fruit, which must be freshly 
gathered and fully rip~e. Sprinkle white sugar over the 
fruit. Place the filled jars in a fish boiler, fill it half full of 
warm water; place a little straw between the jars. Bring 
the water to boiling and keep it at this point for fiftj' min- 
utes, keeping the boiler almost closed ; scald the covers of 
the jars, place them on the jars as quickly as possible while 
the fruit is hot. 



PRESERVES, ETC 2^1 

STRAWBERRIES PRESERVED IN THE SUN. 
Select fine, large berries, remove the hulls. To each 
pound of berries put three-quarters of a pound of white 
sugar, let the sugar remain over the berries for three hours, 
then place all in the preserving kettle and boil for ten 
minutes. At the end of that time carefully remove the 
berries from the syrup with a skimmer and place them on 
platters and put them in the sun. Cook the syrup until it 
is thick, then pour it over the berries. The next day pour 
off the syrup, re-heat it, pour it over the berries and put all 
in the sun. Keep the berries in the sun until all the syrup 
is absorbed, then put into glass jars and co_yer with papers 
wet in alcohol, and with dry papers pasted over. 

VEGETABLE MARROW PRESERVE. 

BOSTON SQUASH. 

Peel and remove the pulp and seeds, then cut into inch 
cubes, let no water be added, the juice of the marrow being 
sufficient moisture for the syrup — two pounds of marrow, 
two pounds of sugar, the juice of one lemon, the peel cut 
fine, three-fourths of an ounce of root ginger, one saltspoon- 
ful of cayenne pepper ; boil gently one and one-half hours ; 
when the syrup is transparent, add one-half of a wine glass 
of sherry, brandy or whiskey ; place in glasses and cover 
with papers wet in alcohol and an outer paper pasted over. 
Be careful to rub the marrow, not to wash it, should any 
earth adhere. 

WATERMELON PRESERVES. 
Sixteen pounds of watermelon ; remove the green rind 
and the seeds, cut the melon into two-inch squares. Take 
one-half pound of sugar to every pound of fruit, place in 
kettle one layer of fruit, one layer of sugar, then let these 
stand over night ; next morning boil for four hours steadily, 
then add six lemons cut up into very small pieces and a 
little ginger root ; boil one-half hour longer. 

SYRUP. 
To every pound of white sugar allow one-half pint of 
water and one-half the white of an egg. Beat the egg until 
light, then put it, the sugar and water, into a clean sauce- 



272 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

pan, but let the sugar dissolve before putting on the fire. 
When the syrup boils, add one teacup of cold water, but do 
not stir it at all. Carefully remove all the scum as it rises, 
and when the syrup is clear it is ready for use. Put into 
glass jars and cover. It will keep for a long time. 

ORANGE SUGAR. 

Cut off the thin yellow rind of oranges, and dry it. 
When it is dry (it will take two days to dry) put into the 
mortar with one cupful of granulated sugar. Pound the 
mixture until it is a powder, then rub it through a very fine 
seive. The rind of twelve oranges will require two cupfuls 
of sugar. WhSn very finely powdered, put into tight glass 
jars. One tablespoonful of this mixture is required for 
flavoring a custard or cake. 

Lemon Sugar can be prepared in the same manner as 
orange sugar. 

VANILLA SUGAR. 
One pound of powdered sugar, one ounce of Vanilla 
bean, split the bean, remove the seeds, pound well together 
with the sugar until fine, then bottle for use. 

FRIED APPLES.

tablespoonful of butter, then the apples ; sprinkle a little 
sugar among the apples ; fry slowly until a good brown. 



SALTED NUTS AND CANDY. 273 



SALTED NUTS AND CANDY. 



SALTED ALMONDS-i. 

Blanch one pound of freshly-shelled Jordan almonds 
by pouring boiling water over them. When they have 
stood covered for five minutes rub off the skins of the nuts, 
one by one, with the finger and thumb. This process of 
removing the skin of tiie almond, called blanching, is easily 
accomplished if the water is actually boiling, not merely 
warm, when it is poured over them. For this purpose the 
nuts should be placed in a tin pan and left a moment on the 
stove after the boiling water is poured over them. They 
should all be covered in order that the skins of all shall be 
" started," so they will rub off easily with the finger and 
thumb. Dry the blanched nuts with coarse towels, so as 
to absorb any moisture about them, and measure them by 
the pint. Allow two tablespoonf uls of the best olive oil or 
the same amount of melted butter to each pint. Toss the 
nuts, a pint at a time, until they are evenly or thoroughly 
coated with the oil, or melted butter, if you prefer it. Let 
the nuts stand closely covered in the closet, under the oven 
or in some such warm place for about an hour, until they 
have partly absorbed the oil about them. Dj-edge two table- 
spoonfuls of salt over them, and stir in order to distribute 
the salt evenly. Spread the almonds on tin biscuit-pans, or 
better still, on sheets of tin that fit the oven, and let them 
bake in the oven bottom until they are slightly colored or 
begin to be crisp. If the oven is hot, it will not take over 
ten or twelve minutes. It must not be too hot or they will 
burn. 

Salted almonds are served at dinner, with the cheese 
and crackers, or at an afternoon tea. They are sometimes 
chopped and put on chocolate loaf-cake. 



374 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

SALTED ALMONDS— 2. 

Shell the nuts and blanch them by covering them with 
boiling water for a moment, then throw them into cold 
water in order to remove the skins. To one pint of nuts 
take one tablespoonful of olive oil or melted butter ; let the 
nuts stand in this for an hour, stir them occasionally, then 
drain and sprinkle the nuts with two tablespoonfuls of salt. 
Put into a moderate oven and bake until they are all a deli- 
cate brown. 

You can prepare peanuts and pine nuts in the same 
manner. 

SALl^ED HICKORY NUTS. 
Proceed as for salted almonds — without blanching them. 

PECAN NUTS. 
Proceed as for salted almonds — without blanching them. 

NUT LOAF. 
Chop very fine one-half pound of nuts — almonds, pecan 
or hickory nuts, add one pound of bread crumbs, one-quarter 
of a pound of butter. Stir these into one pint of boiling 
water, add one egg well beaten, a little salt, pepper and a 
piach of sage or any sweet herb. Mix well together. Butter 
a baking dish, pour in the mixture, sprinkle some fine crumbs 
and bits of butter on the top and bake for one hour in a 
moderate oven, then turn the loaf on a^latter and garnish 
with celery tops or parsley. 

CARAMEL. 
One and one-half pounds of brown sugar, one-fourth 
pound of butter, one-fourth pound of chocolate (Baker's), 
one teacupful of milk. Boil twenty minutes, stir all the 
time, then add one tablespoonful of vanilla. Pour on 
buttered plates. 

CARAMELS. 
Two pounds of brown sugar, one cup of milk, piece of 
butter the size of an egg, one-half pound of chocolat^. Boil 
between twenty and thirty minutes ; on taking off pour in 
the white of one egg well beaten ; flavor with vanilla ; beat 
six minutes, then cool. 



SAINTED NUTS AND CANDY. 275 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 

One-third of a cake of Baker's chocolate, two cups of 
granulated sugar, one-half cup of sweet milk, one piece of 
butter the size of an egg ; flavor when done with vanilla, 
using about one tablespoonful. After boiling the chocolate, 
sugar and butter for about fifteen minutes, the sides of the 
kettle become sugary, then pour in the vanilla, take off the 
fire put on two buttered cake pans ; cut before it is hard into 
squares.

FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 



To provide a sick person with nutritious food, of the 
proper quantity and quality, is one of the most important 
requirements of good nursing. It is well known that drugs 
alone cannot take the place of food. In the often long con- 
valescent stage of illness resources are taxed to the utmost to 
prepare the proper food which shall be at the same time 
nourishing and tempting. 

The tray becomes a source of weariness and the question : 
" What shall I give the invalid?" a constantly recurring one. 
Milk is now given so generally that it is absolutely necessary 
to be able to prepare it in many different ways, for of no 
food will a patient weary sooner. Let the tray always 
present an inviting appearance, every napkin and dish be 
perfectly clean, the food arranged in an inviting manner. 
Special care should be given that any diet ordered to be 
served hot is really hot, and any diet to be served cold, is 
cold. 

The food should never wait in the sick room before 
being served, and the tray and contents be at once removed 
after the patient is fed. Attention to little details, trivial 
perhaps in themselves when one is well, but of great con- 
sequence to an invalid, will aid greatly towards the recovery 
of the patient. 

BEEF BROTH— I. 
A good beef broth is really much more nourishing than 
beef tea. To make the broth take a piece from the neck, 
chop it and the bone quite fine, have more beef than bone. 
T.ake one pound of beef and one-third of a pound of bone, 
put one quart of cold water over the meat and bone, cover 
the pan and let it simmer for four hours ; remove all fat, 
put with the broth two stalks of celery and a little salt ; 
strain and serve a small cupful at a time.

BEEF BROTH— 2. 

-Take one pound of the leg of beef, trim off all fat and 
pound the meat well, then put into the stew-pan with one 
quart of cold water, one small carrot cut fine, one onion 
sliced, a little salt, one blade of mace ; stir the broth until 
it boils, then skim carefully ; place on the back of the stove 
and let it simmer for two hours ; strain and serve. If put 
away to keep, be sure to remove all fat before warming it 
again. This should be done to all broths. 

The extracts of beef are nearly always made from the 
least nutritious part of the fresh meat, so that there is little 
left in it, but the flavoring matter and the salts, these serve 
to give an agreeable flavor and rich color, but no solid 
nourishment. 

BEEF ESSENCE. 
This is much better for an invalid than beef tea. Take 
a good beefsteak from the round, say two pounds, cut it in 
small pieces, put into a Mason jar and set in the oven, in a 
pan of hot water ; as the juice runs from the meat take it 
away at intervals and slightly salt it. One teaspoonful of 
this liquor is worth a pint of the ordinary beef tea. 

BEEF JUICE. 
Heat on the broiler a thick piece of steak, about one 
pound ; when hot, squeeze out the juice ; serve at once. 

RAW BEEF SANDWICH. 
Scrape the tender meat with a sharp knife, spread it 
on thin slices of buttered bread, season with a little salt; 
cut off the crusts and cut the sandwich from corner to corner, 
so as to make two small, three-cornered pieces. 

CLAM BROTH. 
Take twelve clams, boil them in their own liquor for 
fifteen minutes, strain the liquor and serve. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 
Take an old chicken, cut it in pieces and put it in the 
saucepan with three pints of cold water, one tablespoonful 
of rice ; let the soup simmer slowly ; when the chicken is 



278 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

thoroughly cooked, take from the fire, skim every bit of fat 
from the soup before serving ; season with salt and pepper. 

EGG BROTH. 

Beat an egg until it is frothy, stir into it a pint of 
boiling hot meat broth, free from fat, season it with a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and eat it hot, with thin slices of dry toast ; 
it may be given to assist the patient in gaining strength. 

MEAT BROTH. 

One pound of mutton, one pound of veal, one-half a 
chicken, one calf's foot, two quarts of water, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a little pepper ; simmer for four hours, strain 
and put in a mold and keep on the ice untrl needed. Serve 
hot. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

One and one-half pounds of mutton, free from gristle, 
one quart of cold water, two tablespoonfuls of rice, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt; simmer for four hours, strain and 
serve a small quantity at a time to the patient ; serve very 
hot. 

BROTH MADE FROM THE SHEEP "TROTTERS." 

Take eight trotters with just a little of the lower part 
of the meat from the leg ; put them into four quarts of cold 
water and one cupful of rice ; let them simmer slowly for 
eight hours, add a little salt and take from the fire and 
strain. The next day take off every particle of fat and heat 
a little of the broth ; it should be given in small quantities 
and frequently. This is a very excellent broth for a weak 
stomach. A patient can retain it when all other broths or 
foods have failed. 

VEAL BROTH. 

Two pounds of perfectly lean veal, one-fourth pound 
of pearl barley; cut the meat into thin, small pieces; boil 
it and the barley together for three hours, boil slowly ; then 
strain through a sieve and add one-half teaspoonful of salt. 
This broth is light and nourishing, and easy of digestion. 



FOOD FOll INVALIDS. 2^9 

HAMBURG STEAK. 

Take one-half pound of good beef ; scrape all the pulp 
from the fiber, season with a little salt and pepper, make 
into a small steak and broil over a clear fire, or cook 
on the skillet, which should be very hot before the meat is 
put on it. Three minutes will cook the steak. Place a 
small piece of butter on the steak, garnish with a little bit 
of parsley, and serve very hot. 

MILK OF EGGS. 

Beat the yolks of two fresh eggs with one-half table- 
spoonful of sugar and one teaspoonful of orange flower 
water; stir these into one-half pint of boiling milk or water. 
This must be taken hot, and is most soothing for a cold or 
cough. 

EGG AND PORT WINE. 

One fresh egg mixed with one tablespoonful of cold 
water, then add one wine glass of Port wine, a little grated 
nutmeg. Put a teaspoonful of sugar into the sauce-pan and 
when hot, stir in the egg mixture and stir carefully. The 
mixture is then poured into- a glass and served with a 
cracker. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Have the water in the sauce-pan boiling, add a little 
salt and one tablespoonful of vinegar. Break the eggs 
separately into a saucer, slip them into the water carefully ; 
do not let the water boil again. Pour some of the hot 
water over each egg with a spoon, so as to make a thin 
white film over them. Take carefully from the fire ; place 
each egg on a piece of hot toast. Serve hot. 

EGGS POACHED IN BROTH, 

Have the broth hot in the sauce-pan, break very gently 
the eggs into it, cook three minutes, remove and put each 
egg on a slice of hot toast ; if the gravy is desired, thicken 
it with a little flour, add one teaspoonful of butter, strain 
around the egg. 



28o THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

POACHED EGGS IN MILK. 
Have the milk boiling hot, add a little salt, drop in the 
eggs carefully, one by one ; remove as soon as they are set ; 
place on hot toast, and serve at once. 

EGG-NOG. 

One egg beaten very light, one tablespoonful of sugar 
beaten into the egg, then add slowly one tablespoonful of 
brandy and one-half a cup of milk — cream may be substi- 
tuted for the milk. 

BREAD JELLY, 
Remove the crust from the roll, slice the crumb and 
toast it; put the slices in one quart of water, and set it over 
the fire to simmer until it jellies ; then strain it through a 
cloth, sweeten it, and flavor it with lemon juice ; put it into 
a mold and cool it upon the ice before using. 

CURRANT JELLY-WATER, 
Dissolve one teaspoonful of currant jelly in a glass of 
cold water. 

CHICKEN JELLY. 
See chapter on Chicken. 

LEMON JELLY.

three pints of boiling water, one ounce of gelatine dissolved 
in the boiling water, then add the juice and sugar and strain 
into small molds. 

RESTORATIVE JELLY. 
One half box of gelatine, one tablespoonful of granu- 
lated gum-arabic, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, two cloves, one-half a pint of 
port — soak all these together for two hours ; keep the basin 
covered; then put into a sauce-pan and cook, stirring con- 
stantly until everything is dissolved, then strain and place 
on the ice. This jelly is excellent where the patient is 
unable to swallow solid food or even liquid, for it melts 
slowly in the mouth. A tablespoonful of beef juice can be 



FOOD FOU INVALIDS. 3SI 

added when the jelly is taken from the fire, if a stimulent 
is desired. 

STRENGTHENING JELLY. 
One pint of port wine, one package of gelatine, three- 
fourths of an ounce of gum arable, one-fourth pound bf rock 
candy. Place all in a basin and let the mixture stand all 
night ; the next morning put the basin in one of boiling 
water, stir constantly until the ingredients are dissolved, 
then strain through a jelly bag into a mold. 

SAGO JELLY. 
One cupful of sago soaked over night in cold water. 
Boil it in a double boiler for one hour, then uncover and let 
the water boil away ; add two cupfuls of sugar and the juice 
of one lemon ; pour into the dish in which it is to be served 
to cool. Serve rich cream with jelly. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 
Wash one ounce of tapioca, soak it over night in cold 
water, and then simmer it with a bit of lemon peel until it 
is thoroughly dissolved. Sweeten it to taste, and let it cool 
before using. 

EGG PUDDING. 

One egg beaten until light, and one teaspoonful of flour 
which has been mixed smoothly into one tablespoonful of 
milk, add a saltspoonful of salt (be careful with the salt as 
many invalids dislike salt), strain into a buttered cup, and 
set into boiling water to simmer for twenty minutes. 

EGG TEA-i 
Beat the yolk of an egg in a cup of tea, and let the 
sick person drink it warm ; the yolk is more readily 
digested than the white, and has a better flavor ; and the 
tea is a powerful respiratory excitant, while it promotes 
perspiration, and aids the assimilation of more nourishing 
foods. 

EGG TEA-2 
The white of one egg beaten into a stiff froth ; the yolk 
beaten light with one teaspoonful of sugar. Mix together

fire, add one saltspoonful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of 
cream. 

FLOUR GRUEL. 

Put into a strong cotton cloth, one pint of flour, tie it 
up into a ball, boil for four hours, keep it well covered 
with water. When needed to use, have one pint of milk 
boiling in the double boiler, stir into it one tablespoonful of 
the flour-ball, (you scrape the ball and mix a little water 
with the flour), add one saltspoonful of salt and a little 
sugar if liked. This is an excellent remedy in cases of 
summer complaint. The ball will keep for months, if kept 
dry and cool.

fire and add the whites of two eggs, beaten stiffly. Add a 
little sugar and a little grated nutmeg. 

SAGO GRUEL. 

Soak one ounce of sago, after washing it well, in a 
■pint of tepid water for two hours ; then simmer it in the 
same water for fifteen minutes, stirring it occasionally ; then 
sweeten and flavor it to taste, and use at once.

EGGS AND ORANGE JUICE. 

A palatable, nourishing drink for a person with weak 
digestion is made with the whites of two eggs beaten but 
not frothed, and the juice of one orange ; place on the ice 
until very cold. The white of an egg, beaten, slightly 
sweetened and flavored with orange juice or a little vanilla, 
is also a good drink for an invalid ; all should be served 
very cold. 

WINE WHEY. 

Take one cup of new milk and boil, adding a cup of 
sherry. Then strain through a cheese cloth. 

MILK PREPARATIONS. 

Milk is of special value as a food for invalids ; it is 
easily taken, easily digested, and the diet is more under the 
control of the physician than other foods. Life can be 
supported for a long time on milk alone. 

"Milk contains all of the ingredients needed for 
nourishment ; it furnishes the materials needed which build 
up the body and keep it in repair, and also those which 
supply it with fuel to keep it warm and to furnish the 
animal machine with the necessary power to do its work. 
Skim milk has great value as a fdbd when used in cooking 
or when taken with bread. Milk comes nearest to being a 
perfect food." 

BAKED MILK. 

Put the milk into a jar ; cover the top with white paper ; 
bake the milk in a moderate oven until thick as cream. 
This preparation of milk can be taken by the most delicate 
stomach. 

CLABBERED MILK. 

Fill a glass dish with milk, cover and let it stand until 
it is smooth and jelly like — in winter this may take three or 
four days, in summer, two generally. When the milk is 
clabbered, put the dish on the ice for an hour to chill it, 
do not disturb it. Serve with sweet cream and a little 
g rated nutmeg.

MILK WITH CHOCOLATE. 

Grate one ounce of chocolate ; mix it into a paste with 
a little cold milk, then stir it into one pint of boiling milk, 
add a little salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, and the well- 
beaten yolks of two eggs. Serve hot. 

CHICKEN MILK. 

Cut a chicken into small pieces, see that it is well 
cleaned in a careful manner, take off the skin, put the 
chicken into a sauce-pan which is either granite-ware or 
China-lined, add a tablespoonful of celery cut fine, a little 
sprig of parsley, four pepper-corns, one-half saltspoonful of 
salt; cover the meat with cold water and let it simmer until 
the meat is all in rags, then strain into a bowl ; when cold, 
it should be a firm jelly. When needed, carefully wipe off 
every bit of fat from the top of the jelly. Take equal quan- 
tities of jelly and fresh milk, boil them together, strain into 
a cup — one teacupful is sufficient at a time. It can be used 
hot or allowed to again become cold and formed into jelly. 
A small strip of toast can be served with it if desired. 

CITRONIZED MILK JELLY. 

One quart of milk, ttree-fourths of a pound of pow- 
dered sugar, four lemons, one ounce of gelatine. Boil the 
milk, sugar and gelatine together with some of the lemon 
rind cut very thin, then put the mixture into a basin to cool ; 
add the juice of the lemon and stir until the milk is curdled, 
then pour into a mold and let the jelly set. The casein rises 
to the top ; when the jelly is turned out it occupies the base 
and the jelly the top. 

DIGESTED MILK. 

One pint of milk added while boiling hot, to one pint 
of cold milk, then add thirty grains of carbonate of soda, 
then one and one-half teaspoonfuls of Liquid Pancreaticus ; 
mix and let stand for three hours in an even temperature. 
This preparation can be used when Koumiss is not obtain- 
able. Take a large wine glassful at a time. 



FOOD KOR INVALIDS. 2S7 

HOT MILK. 

Hot milk is one of the most nourishing things that can 
be given to a weak or exhausted patient, or to any one'suf- 
fering from a severe chill. If it is absolutely necessary to 
add any other stimulant, add it after the milk is taken from 
the fire. The milk should never boil for hot milk. 

JUNKET. 

One pint of fresh milk, warm the milk slightly, then 
stir into it one teaspoonf ul of rennet liquor, or one teaspoon- 
ful of Prepared Pepsin — use only the best for preparing 
Junket. Stir the rennet liquor or the pepsin only enough 
to mingle it with the milk ; the milk will thicken in a few 
minutes ; place on the ice or in a cold place. Serve with 
sweet cream and sugar or with cream and a little nutmeg. 

LAB AN. 

One quart of new milk, one tablespoonful of yeast ; 
stir the yeast into the milk and let it stand for twenty-four 
hours — it will then be hard. Take a tablespoonful of this 
and stir into a quart of new- milk and put it away to 
harden — this is Laban. To keep a supply, if needed, reserve 
a tablespoonful each day for the next preparation. Eat 
with sugar and cream. 

MILK SOUP. 
One quart of milk, one egg, one-half tablespoonful of 
flour, a little salt, one-half teaspoonful of sugar, a little 
lemon peel or a bit of cinnamon stick. Boil these together ; 
as soon as the mixture boils, remove from the fire and stir 
in the white of egg beaten very stiff. 

THICK MILK. 
Put into the stew-pan one tablespoonful of flour, one 
tablespoonful of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt. Mix together 
until a smooth paste with one pint of milk; stir with a 
wooden spoon ; if too thick add more milk. Boil for fifteen 
minutes. The soup should be thick enough to coat the 
spoon. Add a little nutmeg if' liked and serve. It is a 
digestible soup for young children. 



288 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

MILK WITH WHITE OF EGG. 

One cup of milk ; beat well with the milk the white of 
an egg ; put into a glass and serve ; add the milk slowly to 
the egg. The addition of a tablespoonful of clear coffee is 
sometimes relished by the patient — or the milk slightly 
salted. 

MILK SHAKE. 

Fill up a large glass two-thirds full of sw^eet milk, 
sweeten with syrup, or with the strained juice from any 
rich preserve, a few drops of vanilla can be added or a tea- 
spoonful of orange juice. Fill up the glass with pounded 
ice, place the mixture in the shaker and shake well, or pour 
from one glass to another until well mixed. 

BARLEY WATER. 

Wash two ounces of pearl barley in cold water until it 
does not cloud the water ; boil it for five minutes in half a 
pint of water ; drain that off, put the barley into two quarts 
of clean water, and boil it down to one quart. Cool, strain, 
and use. Pearl barley largely contains starch and mucilage, 
and makes an excellent soothing and refreshing draught in 
fevers and gastric inflamations. 

CRUST COFFEE. 

Toast two slices of bread until very brown, break into 
small pieces, put one-half pint of the pieces into a pitcher 
and pour over them one and one-half pints of boiling water ; 
cover the pitcher, let it stand for ten minutes, then strain. 
Serve either hot or cold— a little milk can be added if liked, 
or the coffee can be made with boiling hot milk instead of 
water. 

FLAXSEED LEMONADE— i. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of flaxseed into a pitcher, pour 
over it one pint of boiling water ; let this steep for three 
hours on the back of the stove, then strain and add the juice 
of one lemon and one tablespoonful of sugar or more if 
desired ; if the lemonade is too thick, add more water. This 
is soothing for colds and fever. 



food"for~invalids. 289 

FLAXSEED LEMONADE— 2. 
Pour one quart of boiling water over four tablespoonfuls 
of whole flaxseed, and steep three hours, covered Then 
sweeten to taste, and add the juice of two lemons, using a 
little more water if the liquid seems too thick to be pala- 
table. This beverage is very soothing to the irritated 
membranes in cases of severe cold. 

KOUMISS. 
Two quarts of milk slightly warmed, add two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and one-half of a two-cent cake of com- 
pressed yeast. Blend ingredients thoroughly, bottle and 
cork and tie corks down ; put in warm place for six hours 
and then in ice box for twojdays before using. 

ICELAND MOSS CHOCOLATE. 
Dissolve one ounce of Iceland moss in one pint of boil- 
ing milk ; boil one ounce of chocolate for five minutes in one 
pint of boiling water ; thoroughly mix the two, and give it 
to the invalid night and morning. This is a highly nutfa- 
tive drink for convalescents. 

DRY TOAST". 
In making toast there is apt to be great carelessness 
and ignorance shown ; the bread is generally cut too thick 
and the slices are unevenly colored. Cut the slices thin and 
even ; it is a good plan to dry the slices before toasting, then 
place them on the toaster over a clear fire, and turn con- 
stantly so that the slices are well browned ; always serve 
toast hot, 

CREAM TOAST— I. 
Toast a slice of bread evenly and quickly ; dip it into 
boiling water, then sprinkle a little salt on it, and cover 
with rich hot cream. 

CREAM TOAST— 2. 
Prepare as for dry toast ; pour over a little hot water, 
which must be drained off in a few minutes ; then spread 
some butter and a little salt on the slices, and pour over 
some good rich cream ; place in a hot oven for a few minutes 
and serve at once.

MARROW-BONE TOAST. 
Take two beef marrow-bones, cover each end with 
dough made with flour and water mixed together, boil the 
bones for an hour, then remove the. doughi, take out the 
marrow, spread on hot toast and season with salt and cay- 
enne, and serve hot. 

OYSTER TOAST. 
Chop very fine fifteen- good oysters, add a little salt and 
pepper and a little nutmeg; beat two eggs with one table- 
spoonful of cream, heat and stir in the oysters, simmer 
together for five minutes, then pour the mixture over slices 
of hot, buttered, toast. 

WATER TOAST. 
When the toast is ready, place in hot plate, pour over 
a little boiling water, spread a little butter evenly orj top 
and a little fine salt, cover tightly for a few minutes to soak 
up the water, and serve immediately. 

OATMEAL WAFERS. 
Sift the oatmeal flour several times that it may be very 
fine ; take one quart of flour, mix it into a dough with cold 
water, add a little salt, work the dough until smooth, then 
roll it out very thin ; cut into squares or bake in one large 
sheet in a very cool oven. 

CHICKEN CREAM. 
Pound the breast of a cooked chicken to a smooth 
paste in the mortar; add some of the broth, one saltspoon 
of salt and a little pepper ; keep on the ice ; when required 
to use, heat a portion over hot water and add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream. 

CAUDLE. 
Put one-4ialf a wine glass of wine into any plkin gruel, 
flour or cracker ; stir it in while the gruel is hot, but not on 
the fire. 

CRACKERS AND MARMALADE. 
Toast three soda crackers, dip them for one minute in 
boiling water, spread them with a little sweet butter, and 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 29I 

put between them layers of orange marmalade, or any other 
preserve or jelly ; put plenty upon the top cracker and set 
them in the oven for two or three minutes before serving. 
This makes a delicate and inviting lunch for convalescents. 

CUSTARD SAVORY. 

Mix the yolks of two eggs and the whites of one in a 

gill of white stock, put into a small jam pot, tie a piece of 

buttered paper over it and boil for one-fourth hour in a 

bain-marie. Serve either hot or cold with buttered toast. 

CUSTARD FOR AN INVALID. 
Three tabespoonfuls of milk, one egg beaten into the 
milk and one dessert-spoonful of flour, which has been 
warmed and dried ; when the ingredients are thoroughly 
blended, strain into a buttered cup, place the cup in a pan 
containing hot water, cover the top of the cup w^ith a wet 
cloth. Bake slowly for twenty minutes, then turn it on to 
a small dish — be careful not to break the custard — put a 
nice bit of butter on top, and a little fine sugar. 

CRACKERS AND CREAM. 
Pour boiling water over one large cracker, sprinkle a 
little salt over and cover the cracker a few minutes, then 
pour over some cream and serve. 

SOAKED CRACKERS. 
Cover a hard pilot biscuit with cold water, when the 
water is all absorbed, cover the cracker again with cold 
water and place in the oven ; when thoroughly heated, put 
a little salt on it and two tablespoonfuls of sweet cream. 

CUSTARD BROTH. 
Four fresh eggs, beat them until smooth, then pour them 
into three teacupfuls of broth, either of chicken, veal or 
beef ; strain and then fill four cups with the custard, place 
them in a pan of boiling water, which should come within 
one-half inch of the tops of the cups — the water must not 
boil. Bake until the custard is firm, no longer ; let the cus- 
tards cool in water. They may be eaten either hot or cold.

SANDWICHES. 



HOW TO MAKE. 

Sandwiches may be made of white, brown or Graham 
bread. The bread should be at least twelve hours old and 
close grained. Spread each slice lightly and evenly with 
butter or mayonnaise dressing, as may be required, before 
cutting from the loaf; lay the slice on a flat surface to be 
spread with the sandwich mixture ; over this place another 
spread slice of bread and press them together with a broad- 
bladed knife. They may be cut into various shapes, the 
square, triangular or diamond form being the most in use. 
Round sandwiches are made by using a large sized biscuit 
cutter. Slices cut into squares large enough to roll make 
another variet)'. 

SARDINE. 
Sandwiches in any form are always welcomed. The 
following are a little different from the regulation sand- 
wiches. Remove the skin and bones from some sardines 
and chop them and add a small strip of cooked ham chopped 
very fine. Mix with these some paprika and mustard, a 
little tomato or walnut catsup to give it a flavor, and just 
enough vinegar to make the mixture into a thick paste. 
Spread a thin slice of bread with butter and with a layer of 
the mixture. Lay another slice of buttered bread upon 
this and again cover with the mixture. Repeat with three 
or four slices of bread, then take off all the crust and cut 
the bread down into thick slices as you would jelly cake. 

BROILED SANDWICH. 

A broiled sandwich is unusual and is exceedingly good, 
as well as being a nice mode of using underdone beef. 
Spread thin slices of Graham or white bread with butter 
and place between the slices rare beef chopped fine and 



SANDWICHES. 293 

seasoned with salt and paprika. Place the sandwiches in a 
double broiler and brown the bread over a clear fire slowly, 
so that the meat shall have time to become heated. Lay 
the sandwiches upon a heated dish and brush the tops with 
hot butter. A horseradish sauce is often served with these 
sandwiches. 

CHEESE SANDWICH TO SERVE WITH SALID. 
Cut slices of bread thinly in finger lengths ; butter them 
and cut thin slices of Swiss cheese and place them between 
the slices ; season the cheese with a little cayenne ; dip the 
sandwiches in melted butter, place in the oven for a few 
minutes or until the bread is brown. Serve hot. 

POTTED CHEESE SANDWICHES. 
Pound together one-half pound of Cheshire cheese and 
five ounces of butter, a pinch of sugar. Stir into a stiff 
paste with a little white wine and spread evenly on hot 
toast. 

CAVIARE SANDWICHES— I. 
Spread caviare on bread and butter, sqyieeze lemon 
over it, and add a trifle of cayenne pepper. 

CAVIARE SANDWICHES— 3. 
Take a small box of caviare, turn it into a shallow dish 
and beat into it alternately, a little at a time, lemon juice 
and olive oil, and stir until you have a thick, white paste. 
Spread it thickly on bread. Over this scatter some finely 
chopped olives. 

CREAM CHEESE SANDWICH. 
Delicious sandwiches may be made with one cup of 
English walnut meats chopped very fine and mixed with 
enough Philadelphia cream cheese to make a paste. Add a 
little salt and spread on very thin bread. 

CELERY SANDWICHES. 
Boil two eggs fifteen minutes, throw them into cold 
water, remove the shells and rub the eggs through a course 
seive, add to them a cup of finely chopped celery and enough 
mayonnaise dressing to season it and make a paste. Spread 
on buttered toast. 



294 '^''^^ S'^^'S COOK BOOK. 

CHERRY SANDWICH. 
Another sandwich to serve with punch or lemonade is 
made of candied cherries chopped fine and moistened with 
a little wine. Spread the mixture between water thin 
biscuits. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES. 
Chop the white meat of cold boiled chicken very fine, 
and mix with it enough highly seasoned mayonnaise dress- 
ing to make a paste, add to this a few chopped olives and 
spread between buttered slices of bread. Another chicken 
filling is made by chopping the chicken fine with half as 
many blanched almonds as you have meat ; season with salt 
and a dash of cayenne pepper. Moisten with a little cream 
until it is thin enough to spread nicely. This is excellent 
on brown bread. 

HOT CHEESE SANDWICHES, 
To prepare them slice the bread very thin and cut it 
round with a large sized biscuit cutter. Put a thick layer 
of grated cheese between the two circles of bread, sprinkle 
the cheese with salt and cayenne pepper and press circles 
of bread together. Fry them in a spider in equal parts of 
hot lard and butter. Brown them on each side and serve 
hot. 

FISH SANDWICHES, 
Graham bread is especially good for fish sandwiches. 
To make a sardine sandwich take three sardines and remove 
the skin and bones. Put them in a bowl with one teaspoon- 
ful of anchovy paste, the yolks of three boiled eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil and the juice of half a lemon. 
With the back of a spoon rub this mixture to a paste and 
spread on bread. 

FRIED SANDWICH. 
A delicious fried sandwich is made with stale bread and 
a bit of dry cheese — two things that can usually be found in 
one's larder ; cut the bread thin and spread it with French 
mustard ; cover this with a thick layer of grated cheese and 
sprinkle with salt and a dash of cayenne. Press the slices 
of bread well together and cut them into any shape desired. 



SANDWICHES. 295 

Have equal parts of lard and butter heated to boiling point 
in a frying pan ; put in the bread sandwiches and cook both 
sides brown and serve very hot. These sandwiches may be 
varied by scattering a little minced ham or chopped parsley 
over the cheese. 

HOT SANDWICH. 
Here is another mode of utilizing stale bread. Graham 
or white can be used ; cut it into rather thick slices and 
lightly toast them, cutting them into any fancy shape. To 
three-quarters of a cup of chopped ham or tongue add a 
little grated cheese, some chopped parsley, a tablespoonful 
of cream and the yolk of a beaten egg. Mix^hese 
ingredients well together and spread thickly upon the 
toasted bread and sprinkle a little grated cheese over the 
top. Place the pieces in a baking pan, put them into a hot 
oven and brown well. 

HAM SANDWICHES. 
One can of deviled ham, soften with rich cream and 
one glass of sherry. Spread on thin bread and butter. 

LETTUCE SANDWICH. 
Cut the bread very thin and stamp round with a biscuit 
cutter ; spread thickly with mayonnaise dressing, and lay 
white crisp lettuce leaves on the dressing between the 
slices, letting the lettuce lewes come beyond the slices ; 
press the upper piece of bread over the lettuce and trim 
the leaves with sharp scissors to make them even on all 
sides. Watercress may be used in the same way. 

OLIVE SANDWICH. 
Chopped olives mixed with a little mayonnaise dressing 
are a popular filling for sandwiches at five o'clock teas, as 
well as brown or white bread cut very thin, and buttered 
and spread with almonds, walnuts or Pecan nut meats 
pounded to a paste with a little salt. 

RAISIN SANDWICHES. 
Raisin sandwiches are excellent to serve with lemonade. 
With a pair of sharp scissors cut large raisins in two, 
lengthwise, and remove the seeds. Lay the fruit closely 



296 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

together between thin buttered bread and cut into fancy 
shapes. 

MAYONNAISE WITH OLIVES. 
Cut with the pastry cutter some rounds of thin, white 
bread; spread with mayonnaise sauce, in w^hich mix 
chopped olives. 

COLD ROAST BEEF SANDWICH. 
A hearty sandwich that most men are fond of is made 
thus : Chop very fine cold rare roast beef, and to one cup- 
ful of meat add one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of tomato catsup, and the same arnount of 
Worcestershire sauce and of melted butter, stir until well 
blended and spread on thin slices of bread. Or thus : To 
half a cupful of thick mayonnaise add two spoonfuls of 
whipped cream, a dessertspoonful of grated horseradish, 
and two of chopped cucumbers. Spread the bread with 
this mixture, and then with a thin layer of finely chopped 
rare beef and cover with more dressing and bread. 

SPANISH SANDWICHES. 
Butter some slices of fresh brown bread, and sprinkle 
on each slice a little cayenne, then put some boned an- 
chovies, laying them flat, and sprinkle over all the yolk of 
an egg cooked hard and rubbed through a sieve, some finely 
minced cold chicken, and a nttle chopped parsley; place 
the other slices of bread over, press them well together, cut 
into rounds and serve garnished with sprigs of parsley. 

LEBERWURST SANDWICHES. 
Spread the leberwurst on slices of rye bread, do not 
use butter. Leberwurst is a German sausage made of 
goose's livers, truffles, etc. Scoop out of the sausage skin. 

TOMATO SANDWICH. 

Cut thin slices of bread and butter evenly, then cut 
them into rounds with a biscuit cutter, lay on one slice of 
the bread a slice of ripe tomato, sprinkle the other slice 
with grated cheese, season with salt and pepper ; press the 
two slices together. 



SANDWICHES. 297 

FISH SANDWICH. 

Use any cooked fish, free from bones, spread the slices 
of bread with butter ; mix the fish with finely chopped 
pickle and mayonnaise, and spread on the bread. 

SAUSAGE SANDWICHES. 

Take the small link sausage, split them lengthwise and 
broil on each side. When they become cool, cover buttered 
bread with delicate lettuce leaves and lay the sausage upon 
them ; then the thinnest possible slices of cucumber pickles, 
and lastly a piece of buttered bread. Cut them into small 
squares. 

It may well be said of sandwiches that their name is 
legion.

BEVERAGES. 



APPLE TODDY. 
Two tumblers of boiling waters, two tumblers of white 
loaf sugar, one tumbler of best brandy, one-half tumbler of 
peach brandy, one-half tumbler of Jamaica rum. Remove 
the cores from ten apples, bake them. Mix the sugar well 
in the boiling water first, and then add the other liquors, 
then the apples ; this is better made the day before it is to 
be used. 

BONUM. 
Three-fourths quart of whiskey, one gill of Vermouth, 
one-third wine glass of orange bitters, thirty drops of 
Angostora bitters, one wine glass of Benedictine, one wine 
glass of Curacoa, one glass of rock candy syrup. 

COCKTAIL A LA SHERRY. 
Equal portions of Old Tom gin and Vermouth, small 
portion of orange bitters, a dash of Marischino. 

CHOCOLATE. 
"Time and experience, those two great masters, have 
proved that, when properly prepared, chocolate is whole- 
some, nourishing and easily digested ; and also that it is 
most suitable for those who have much brain work— for 
clergymen, lawyers, literary men, and, above all, for 
travelers." — Brillat-Savarin. 

ARABIAN CHOCOLATE. 
One-half pound of French chocolate, one pound of rice 
flour, one-fourth pound of arrowroot, one-half pound of loaf 
sugar pounded fine. These should be well mixed together ; 
a tablespoonful may be slightly wet with milk or water, 
then stirred into one pint of boiling milk and boiled for five 
minutes. It can be served either hot or cold. 



BEVERAGES. 299 

CHOCOLATE. 

To one quart of boiling milk take four ounces of 
chocolate ; put the chocolate into a small pan on the fire, 
add three tablespoonfuls of cold water ; stir together until 
the chocolate is thick and smooth, then stir it into the boil- 
ing milk ; add three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir for five 
minutes and serve hot. If desired, put on the top of each 
cup one spoonful of whipped cream. One teaspoonful of 
sherry to each cup greatly improves the chocolate. 

FILTERED COFFEE. 

Allow one and one-half tablespoonfuls of ground coffee 
to each person. Put the coffee into the filter and pour over 
the boiling water slowly, allowing one cup of water for each 
person ; after all the water has gone through the coffee pour 
it all through the second time. 

COFFEE FOR FIVE PERSONS. 

One cup of coffee before being ground, half egg, two 
quarts of boiling water. Beat one egg with two table- 
spoonfuls of cold water. Grind the coffee, put one-half the 
egg on the grounds, then wet it thoroughly with cold water 
so that every grain will be wet. Pour the boiling water 
on, boil about ten minutes after it comes to a boil. The 
other half of the egg will answer for the next coffee. 

Note. — Put all the water on the coffee that is required, 
as it spoils the coffee to add water after. The water should 
be perfectly fresh, and the coffee should be used as soon as 
it has boiled. 

The coffee should be placed on the hottest part of the 
range, or gas stove, so that it will boil as quickly as 
possible, watching it constantly that it may not boil over. 

The coffee pot should never be washed with soap, or a 
dish cloth, simply rinse it out thoroughly with cold water, 
then with boiling water ; turn the pot upside down to dry. 
Never use a towel to dry it. 

Use a wooden spoon or ladle, and never use anything 
else; rinse and dry as soon as you. are through with it. 
Never let the coffee pot stand with coffee in it.

USEFUL HINTS. 305 



USEFUL HINTS. 



ECONOMY. 
Never go in for that sort of seeming saving which 
consists in the use of cheap materials either in meats, 
groceries or fats ; the best articles are the cheapest in 
the end. Economy is a good and a splendid quality, 
but it must be intelligent economy. The avoidance of 
waste in every department of the kitchen, larder and pantry 
is the only true economy. Never allow the least scrap to 
go to loss, but strive to turn even the scraps to some good 
use. Scrupulous cleanliness is indi^pensible. Clealiness in 
everything, vegetables carefully washed and rinsed, every 
utensil invitingly clean. 

BROWNED FLOUR. 
Put some sifted flour into a pan, place it on the stove 
and stir constantly from the bottom, whenever it begins to 
stick — do not let it burn, but when well browned, it is 
done. Put in a tin canister- or glass jar to keep until 
needed. 

TO CLEAN CURRANTS. 
The best way is to sprinkle them with flour and rub 
them until the grit, stems and flour are removed ; then put 
them in the strainer and let the water run through them 
until it is perfectly clear ; then dry the currants on a coarse 
towel. 

SWEET HERBS. 
Many recipes call for "Sweet Herbs;" the proper 
mixture is : One part marjoram, two parts thyme, and 
three parts parsley. It is a wise precaution to dry bunches 
of these herbs carefully, sift them through a sieve, and mix 
in the above proportions and bottle ready for use. 



306 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

Add a pinch of salt when whipping the whites of 
eggs. 

A Httle sugar is a great improvement to soups. 
Add a little salt to sweet dishes. 

Beat the yolks of eggs until they are a light lemon 
color. 

Put one teaspoonful of hot water always into the yolk 
of an egg when used for breading, with crumbs and eggs. 

In making hard sauce add the powdered sugar slowly, 
a little at a time. 

Always fold in the whipped whites of eggs, into cake 
batter or other batters, rather than to beat them in. 

Always strain any mixture of flour and milk or water 

to avoid lumps and always add milk or water a little at a 
time in mixing any thickening. 

MEAT. 

Never place meat directly on the ice in the refrigerator ; 
the water draws out the juices of meat. 

Never allow meat to remain in the paper in which it 
is brought from the butcher, or in the hot kitchen ; put it 
at once in a cool place. 

All meat that has been hung long must be carefully 
scraped and washed off with vinegar and water before 
using — the outer skin may have acquired a stale taste. 

All warmed-over meats, if fried, should either be 
breaded or else dipped into batter and fried. The batter, 
or egg and bread crumbs form a crust and keep the meat 
tender and juicy ; if cold meat is fried without either, it is 
always hard and stringy. 

Meat is cooked in "its own juice," by placing the piece 
in a stone jar with a cover, without any water, and letting 
it cook on the back of the stove slowly and gently. 

All meats cooked at a low degree of heat are rendered 
tender and palatable. 

In broiling either meats or fish, be sure that the 
gridiron is perfectly clean, and that it is rubbed with good 
fat, and is hot before using. 



USEFUL HINTS. 307 

In broiling, no thin pieces should be broiled, only thick 
fleshy pieces. No forks should ever be stuck into them, 
nor should they be cut with a knife. You may sprinkle 
your steak or chop with a little pepper, but never add the 
salt till the meat is done. 

Cold beef cut in slices, covered with vinegar overnight, 
then dipped in egg well seasoned with salt and nutmeg, 
rolled in bread crumbs, fried, makes a very good lunch dish. 

Always rub the broiler or gridiron with fat before using, 
and always have it hot before putting on the meat or fish 
to be broiled. Broiling requires a brisk fire, free from 
smoke. 

A mixture for croquettes can be made and moulded 
and the croquettes kept in a cool place until needed, when 
thev are easily cooked. 

Always see that the oven is hot one hour before baking ; 
meat is spoiled in a cool oven. 



It is indispensible to good cooking that every dish 
requiring to be served hot should not wait in the kitchen, 
but should be served with promptness. 

Remember that wine increases the taste of salt. For 
this reason where wine is used for flavoring, very little 
salt shonld be put in until after the wine has been used, 
w^hen more may be added if necessaiy. 

If the water is hard water, a little pinch of soda should 
be added to soften it for cooking purposes. 

TO KEEP MEATS UNTAINTED. 
Put a piece of charcoal inside of any poultry to be kept 
over night in summer ; when meat has a close or slightly 
tainted smell wash it in water in which is dissolved a tea- 
spoonful of soda, or in water and vinegar mixed. 

Keep lemons in a crock filled with cold water. 

Put oyster shells into a stove that is clinkered. Put in 
when the fire is hot. 

EGG STAIN. 
Salt will remove the stain on egg spoons. 



3o8 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

TO THICKEN WITH CORNSTARCH. 
Corn starch is used to thicken soups or sauces because 
it makes a smoother thickening, but it should be cooked for 
fifteen minutes— ordinary flour requires five minutes to cook. 

MUSHROOM POWDER. 
Mushroom powder can be successfully used in place of 
fresh mushrooms in scrambled eggs and omelettes. 

TO REMOVE MORTAR AND PAINT. 
Mortar and paint may be removed from window glass 
by washing the glass with strong, hot vinegar. 

TO KEEP A CHEESE FRESH. 
Wring out a cloth in cider vinegar, wrap it around the 
cheese, cover with a paper bag and keep the cheese in a dry, 
cool place. The cheese will retain its freshness and will 
not rnpld; 

Serve cream cheese with figs. 

Figs may be freshened by washing them thoroughly, 
drying and then heating them in the oven — take out and roll 
in powdered sugar. 

TO KILL COCKROACHES. 
Helebore sprinkled about on the floor of the rooms 
infested by cockroaches, wrill kill the pests ; they eat it and 
will be poisened. Be sure to sweep the helebore up every 
morning. 

TO REMOVE BLACK BEETLES. 
Try fresh cucumber peelings where black beetles and 
cockroaches haunt. 

TO FRY BREAD TO SERVE WITH SOUP. 

Cut some slices one-fourth of an inch thick from a stale 
loaf, pare off the crust and divide the bread into small dice ; 
put in the pan — for one-half pound of bread a tablespoonful 
of butter ; when it is hot put in the bread, and fry until it is 
colored a pale brown ; drain from the butter and keep warm 
until served. 



USEFUL HINTS. 309 

FRIED BREAD FOR SOUP. 
Cut stale bread into thin slices and moisten them with 
milk, then cut into dice, put in a'pan and fry in butter until 
brown. 

CROUTONS FOR SOUP. 
Cut some slices of bread into small dice and fry in a 
little hot butter until of a light brown color. 

BREADING AND RASPING— i. 

For breading, use beaten eggs, oil and crumbs of either 
cracker or stale bread; if bread is used, rub the crumbs 
through a sieve, dry in the oven, and place in a tin box 
until ready to use. In breading, the eggs should be well 
beaten; for three eggs, add one tablespoonful of oil, one 
tablespoonful of water, a saltspoonful of salt and a pinch of 
pepper. 

"Raspings" are made from crusts of bread baked to a 
bright golden color, then crushed with the rolling pin, 
passed throug a sieve, aud put by for use— the coarse crumbs 
being used to sprinkle over roast birds, etc. 

BREADING— 2. 
In preparing the crumbs for breading any articles, to 
successfully cover the articles, you must use a quantity of 
crumbs — there should be a quart or more of prepared crumbs 
on the board. 

CRUMBS. 
Mix crumbs with a little melted butter before putting 
on the top of any dish. 

CRACKER CRUMBS. 
Crackers should be made hot, then rolled and sifted, 
rolled and sifted again, until they are very fine ; all crumbs 
for breading should be made very fine before using. 

MUSH. 
Put mush for frying into baking powder tins. You 
can slice the mush in round slices which will present a very 
appetizing appearance. 



3IO THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

BREAD CRUMBS. 
Save all pieces of bread. The large slices can be used 
for toast ; small pieces be used in puddings or dried for 
crumbs. Use the white part and crusts separately, dry in 
oven, sift, then put away in glass mason jars. 

CAKE CRUMBS. 
Stale cake is useful in making various puddings. 

TO CLEAN FRUIT. 
The best way to remove sand and grit from small fruits, 
when washing them is necessary, is to lay the fruit loosely 
in a clean wire basket and dip the basket into fresh water 
several times, then let the fruit drain before using. 

TO CHOP PARSLEY. 
In chopping parsley, after it is very fine, wash it, then 
place in the corner of a napkin and wring it dry ; the pars- 
ley will, after this, sprinkle easily over any dish for which 
it is required. 

TO CLEAN IRON KETTLES. 
' A little vinegar and salt, boiled in an iron skillet or 
spider, will remove all burned and black spots. 

TO PREPARE GELATINE. 
Gelatine must be soaked in cold water first, then dis- 
solved in hot water. 

LEFT OVERS. 

Never throw away any of the cereals left over from 
breakfast, they are improved by long cooking, and can be 
added to the supply for the next morning, or they can be 
sliced and fried. 

Save all the vegetables left from dinner. They can be 
used to make a salad with either a French dressing or may- 
onnaise, or they can be used in the soup the next day. 
Save all the bits of meat which are trimmed from the roast 
or steak and all bones ; use these for the soup stock. Clarify 
all bits of suet, and other fat bones to use for frying. Grate 
all the bits of cheese and put into a clean jar to serve on 
crackers or toasted bread, or to use with macaroni. 



USKKUI. HINTS. 3II 

CHOPPING SUET. 

* Always add a little flour when chopping suet to pre- 
vent the suet from oiling and sticking together. 

TO CLEAN SILVER. 

Silver that has been laid away, and has become tar- 
nished, can be cleaned quicker if the whiting used to clean 
with is moistened with sweet oil before applying to the 
silver. Afterwards, dry whiting can be used as usual. 

Gtease all pans and molds with butter, dripping or lard, 
using a small brush. 

TO KEEP FOOD WARM. 

When it is required to keep some dish already prepared 
warm for a time before serving, place in a pan of hot water. 

TO CLEAN KETTLES. 

When any kettle has become black and burned, 
boil in it a solution of sal soda for an hour or more. Use 
soda to soften the grease on pans, and scour with Sapolio. 

TO CLEAN DRAINS. 

Pour a solution of concentrated lye down the drain 
pipe of the kitchen sink at least twice a week, to prevent 
the grease stopping the pipe. 

THE REFRIGERATOR. 

See that the refregerator is kept absolutely clean, 
the drain pipe kept open by washing the refrigerator out 
three times a week with cold water with soda or borax 
dissolved in it. 

STEAMING VEGETABLES. 

Many vegetables can be steamed or stewed in the oven 
when the top of the range is full. After preparing them, 
place them in an earthenware jar with a spoonful of water 
and a very little butter. Cover the jar and stand it in a 
sauce pan of water or the jar can stand in the oven. Green 
peas, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, all can be so cooked. 



312 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

PUT AWAY UTENSILS. 
In cooking, try to clear up all utensils used as you«go 
on ; do not allow all to accumulate. Wash and put each 
one back in its place. Neatness, order and method should 
be observed in every kitchen. 

DRIED FRUITS. 

Dried fruits are better stewed in a double boiler, or 
baked in an earthen jar in the oven, using as little water as 
possible, the fruit to be closely covered. Always carefully 
look over all dried fruits before cooking them, then soak 
them for two or three hours in cold water, or until they are 
soft and swollen to their full extent, when they should be 
stewed in the same water; add the sugar just before they 
are fully cooked. 

Apple sauce is vastly improved by being baked in an 
oven instead of being stewed. 

LIME WATER. 

To make lime water, frequently needed for an invalid's 
or a child's use, put one pound of unslacked lime into a 
large bowl ; pour over this three quarts of boiling water ; let 
it stand for fifteen minutes, then stir it well with a stick. 
Place the bowl in a cool place for several hours ; at the end 
of the time pour off the clear water and bottle it. A tea- 
spoonful may be added to a glass of milk in case of an acid 
stomach, or to render the milk more easy of digestion. 

BURNS. 
In case of a burn, cover the place with bicarbonate of 
soda (salaratus) and bind over it a soft cloth ; this will re- 
lieve by keeping the air from the burnt place. As soda is 
in all kitchens this is a convenient remedy. Lime water 
also is an excellent remedy. Wet cloths in it and place over 
the burn. 

ORANGE SUGAR. 
Cut off the thin yellow rind of oranges, and dry it. 
When it is dry (it will take two days to dry) put it in the 
mortar with one cupful of granulated sugar. Pound the 
mixture until it is a powder then rub it through a very fine 
sieve ; the rind of twelve oranges will require two cupfuls 



USEp-UL HINTS. 313 

•of sugar ; when very finely powdered put into tight glass 
jars. One tablespoonful of this mixture is required for 
flavoring a custard or cake. 

LEMON SUGAR. 
Lemon sugar can be prepared in the same manner as 
orange sugar. 

VANILLA SUGAR. 
One pound of powdered sugar, one ounce of vanilla 
bean ; split the bean, remove the seeds, pound well 
together with the sugar until fine, then bottle. 

MERINGUES. 
In making a meringue, after beating the whites of the 
eggs until they are very stiff, add the sugar to the whites, 
beating it into the whites with a silver spoon, a little at a 
time ; add the flavoring at the last ; the white of one egg 
requires one tablespoonful of sugar. A meringue should be 
baked in a slow oven. 

ONION JUICE. 
When onion juice is required, pare the onion and cut 
it in four pieces if a large onion, and squeeze the pieces in 
a wooden lemon sqneezer ; keep the squeezer for this use 
only. Or the onion can be pressed a,gainst a coarse grater 
and the juice extracted. 

TO KEEP MEATS. 

Meat can be kept in summer for a longer time if it is 
thoroughly rubbed over with olive oil ; steaks should be 
dipped in oil or melted butter or dripping, and then hung 
up. 

Meat can be rubbed with ginger, every crevice filled, if 
desired to keep it for a few days. 



When sponges have become soft and sour rub into 
them some lemon juice, then rinse several times in luke 
warm water and dry. 

Wash old glass jars in hot water in which is dis- 
solved a tablespoonful of baking soda ; after, rinse well in 
cold water. 



314 THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

Flat itons that arc rasty can be cleaned by rubbing 
them with wax tied in a cloth, the irons to be warm ; then 
rub them well on a board strewn with salt. 

Ink spots can be removed from the finders by a little 
ammonia. 

A little ammonia and alcohol mixed, rubbed on black 
silk will remove the "shiny" look^ so often seen on seams 
of dresses. 

TO WASH BLANKETS. 

To each pailful of rain water use one tablespoonful of 
borax. 

Fill the wash boiler with water ; cut into small pieces 
two cakes of any good white soap. When this Is dissolved 
and the water boiling, strain into the washtubs through 
cheese cloth. 

Put in the blankets ; do not mix the colored borders ; 
put all of one color together ; let the blankets remain in 
the water over night ; cover the tubs. The water should 
be made tepid before the blankets are put into it, so cold 
rain water can be added to the hot water. 

The next morning rinse the blankets up and dovv^n in 
the water by holding the ends and going all around the 
four sides ; then have the wringer set very loosely and wring 
the blankets into another tub containing clean cold rain 
water. Rinse the blankets in this the same as in the first 
water ; then wring into another tub of cold water ; wring 
again into a third tub ; from this water take the blankets — 
do not wring them ; hang them on the lines dripping wet 
in the hot sun, changing them twice ; that is, turning them 
upside down twice. The blankets will be beautifully soft 
and clean after they are dry. 

FURNITURE POLISH. 

A FAMOUS RECIPE FROM WARW^ICK, ENGLAND.

with the soda and camphor in the turpentine. Then add 
the boiling water and shake well together, until it looks 
white, and about the consistency of thick cream ; bottle. 
When required, apply a little on a flannel cloth evenly and 
rub it oflF with a clean soft cloth. This preparation can be 
used on any kind of wood work, or on leather goods. 

TO RESTORE THE "PILE" ON VELVET. 

To restore the "pile" on velvet hold the velvet over 
boiling water the wrong side next to the steam, brush the 
velvet lightly as the steam goes through the fiber. 

PAPER BAGS. 
The large paper bags which are made for holding 
banana bunches are very nice for holding blankets and 
other woolens, which require to be put away from moths 
in summer. 

CLEANING MIXTURE FOR BLACK GOODS. 
One-half pint of alcohol, one-half pint of distilled 
water, one ounce of aqua ammonia. Mix and bottle. 

FOR CLEANING CARPETS. 
One bar of good soap, or electric soap ; shave fine into 
one gallon of cold water, add four ounces of pulverized 
sal-soda, eight ounces of fine borax. Boil fifteen minutes. 
Put this into three gallons of cold water and one-half pint 
of alcohol. Rub on carpet with scrubbing brush, and wipe 
off carefully with a clean cloth. 

CLEANING MIXTURE FOR CLOTHING. 
One gallon of deodorized benzine, one-half ounce of 
ether, one-half ounce of chloroform, one ounce of alcohol. 
Mix well and bottle. 

CLEANING MIXTURE FOR RUGS, ETC. 
Two-thirds bar of ordinary kitchen soap, two quarts 
of water in which dissolve the soap, one tablespoonful each 
of borax, alum and washing soda. Mix and let all cool, 
then add two tablespoonfuls of ammonia and one table- 
spoonful of Fuller's earth. 



3l6 TriE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

CLEANSER FOR WOOLENS. 

One-fourth pound of white castile soap, one-fourth 
pound of ammonia, one ounce of ether, one ounce of 
alcohol. Cut soap very find and dissolve thoroughly in 
warm water, one quart ; add four quarts of soft water, then 
the other ingredients. Bottle at once. 

COLD CREAM— I. 

The woman who wishes to be sure that the ingredients 
of her cold cream are absolutely pure can make it herself 
with but little trouble. 

The butcher's and not the druggist's is the place to seek 
for the basis. Secure from him some fine white tallow. 
Cut into bits, put it into a saucepan without any water ; set 
the sauce-pan in a jar of boiling water and let all remain 
until the fat is thoroughly "tried" out of the tallow. Strain 
through a fine sieve and while still warm stir in a teaspoon- 
ful of the essence of camphor to every cup of tallow. Next 
a tablespoonful of your favorite perfume and stir until the 
whole is a sweet smelling Liquid. Before it has had time to 
cool pour into a little toilet jar and set upon the ice over 
night. It will keep indefinitely and will be found a deli- 
cious remedy for all the ills that winds and weather bring 
to the feminine skin. 

COLD CREAM— 2. 

Four ounces of oil of almonds, one and one-half ounces 
of white wax, one and one-half ounces of spermaceti, one 
and one-half ounces of rose water, one and one-half ounces 
of glycerine. Melt these together over a gentle heat ; when 
blended, stir until the mixture is cold ; place in small porce- 
lain jars and cover. 

PERFUMED BAGS FOR THE BATH. 

Mix together five pounds of oatmeal, one-half pound of 
pure Castile soap powdered fine, one pound of powdered 
orris root. Make small cheese cloth bags and fill with the 
mixture ; fill the bags loosely, and sew up one end ; put in 
the bath and use in place of sponge. 



USEFUL HINTS. 317 

FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

One-half ounce of gum benzoin, three and one- half 
ounces of rose water, .one-fourth ounce of glycerine. Mix 
together and bottle. Or eqnal parts of glycerine, rose water 
and spirits of camphor. Rub a little on the hands after 
washing and before drying them. 

TO CLEAN RUSTY METALS. 

Clean with kerosine, which is better than oxalic acid 
for brass or copper ware. Kerosene is harmless, while 
oxalic acid is poisonous. 

PASTE. 

In making a paste either with flour or starch, add a 
little oil of cloves or of winter green, and the paste will not 
sour or mold. 

A SPICE PLASTER FOR .SEVERE PAIN. 

One teaspoonful of ground cloves, one teaspoonful of 
ground cinnamon, one teaspoonful of ground ginger, one 
teaspoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful of ground allspice, 
one teaspoonfnl of wheat flour. Mix well together ; pour 
over the mixture enough boiling water to moisten ; stir until 
smooth and spread on cheese cloth, and apply as hot and as 
quickly as possible. 

TO WASH FANCY WORK. 

In all cases of embroidery on linen, the work should be 
carefully pressed when finished, and it is important for 
every embroiderer to know how this may be done in the 
simplest and safest manner. The proper way to press the 
finished work is to lay the embroidery face down on a 
clean cloth spread over an ironing blanket or two or three 
thicknesses of flannel ; place a thin dampened cloth on the 
back of the article to be pressed, and then use a hot iron 
deftly on the wet surface until it is perfectly dry. A steam- 
ing process is thus engendered, whereby the embroidered 
linen is rendered smooth and the effectiveness of the work 
much enhanced. 



3iS THE 3-6-5 COOK BOOK. 

TO SOFTEN SHOES. 

Shoes that have become stiff and uncomfortable by 
being worn in the rain or that have been lying unused for 
some time, may be made soft and pliable by using vaseline 
well rubbed in with a cloth and rubbed off with a dry cloth. 

TO REMOVE THE SMELL OF PAINT. 

Put a pint of clean, cold water with a slice of lemon 
in it, in the newly painted room. Change the water every 
three or four hours and the unpleasant odor will be taken 
away. 

A FEW LESSONS FOR THE COOK. 

Teach your cook to have a place for everything and to 
put everything in its place. 

Cleanliness, economy and punctuality are necessary. 

Keep all dry stores, such as sugar, rice, etc., in clean, 
dry, covered tins. 

Never pour the water in which greens or cabbage has 
been cooked, down the kitchen sink. Throw it outside ; 
but if this is not possible, at once flush the sink with hot 
water in which some common washing soda has been dis- 
solved. This prevents the odors from pervading the house. 

Never bang the oven door when cake or bread is being 
baked. 

Put in all soiled saucepans some hot water and a small 
lump of washing soda, until there is time to wash and dry 
them. 

When gas stoves are used, insist that the burners are 
turned out as soon as a dish is cooked. A large saving of 
gas will be the result. 

JARELLE WATER. 

Remember never to use Jarelle water on anything 
colored ; use only on white goods. 



USEFUL HINTS. 3I9 

TO REMOVE A SCORCH MARK FROM LINEN. ' 
Slice a large onion, pound it well, then add to the 
juice one ounce of white soap and one ounce Fuller's earth 
and one pint of vinegar. Boil these together, and spread 
the mixture on the scorched linen and leave it on until dry, 
when the article must be well washed in soap suds. 

USES OF TURPENTINE. 

Spirits of turpentine will restore the brilliancy to 
patent leather. Boots and bags look almost new under its 
influence. 

Applied to a burn where the skin is not broken, it 
gives quick relief. 

It sends down the skin of a blister and prevents sore- 
ness. 

Workmen's white overalls and artists' working aprons 
should be steeped in turpentine for twenty-four hours before 
washing to loosen and remove paint. 

A little added to the steeping water (a tablespoonful 
to a gallon) will make linen beautifully white. 

A flannel dipped in hot water and sprinkled with 
turpentine will relieve hoarseness. This application is also 
often ordered for the relief of lumbago and rheumatism. 
It generally relieves neuralgia in the face. 

A few drops in boxes and cupboards will prevent 
moths. 

Soak rags in it, and then place near the holes of mice. 
Renew the oil from time to time. It effectually drives 
them away. 

Add a few^ drops to starch to prevent the iron sticking. 

For a paint mark on cloth that will not wash, put 
turpentine on with a small brush. Begin on the outside of 
the stain and work to the middle, in order to prevent it 
spreading. 

Turpentine mixed with beeswax makes a well known 
polish for floors. A cloth wrung out of turpentine brightens 
up an oil cloth. 

Two parts of sweet oil and one of turpentine make a 
reliable furniture polish. It instantly removes finger marks. 

But do not forget that turpentine is highly inflammable, 
and that it should never be exposed to a flame of gas or fire.

ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 



APRICOT EGGS. 

One sponge cake (one baked in a round tin), cut it into 
slices one-half an inch thick with a round cutter about 
the size of a tumbler. Spread over each round a little 
apricot jam, and cover with whipped cream slightly flavored 
with either lemon or vanilla. In the center place half an 
apricot, a canned one is the better, dust it with pow^dered 
sugar. The eggs are easily and quickly made ; they are 
pretty and good for a simple dessert. 

APRICOT MUSCOVITE. 

One pound of apricot jam, rub through a sieve, and, if 
not sweet enough, add some fine sugar. Make a custard 
with one scant pint of milk and the yolks of four eggs. 
When the custard is thick, let it cool and then add to it 
one-half an ounce of gelatine which has been dissolved in 
a little hot water, strained and cooled. Whip all well 
together, and as soon as the mixture begins to become firm 
add one-half a pint of stiffly whipped cream, one wine glass 
of either noyeau or apricot brandy. Pack into a mold and 
place in a pail, surrounded with broken ice and salt ; let it 
remain in this for at least two hours.* Any good fruit jam 
can be used in the place of apricot. 

ARTICHOKES CREAMED. 

Boil two pounds of Jerusalem artichokes in milk until 
soft enough to mash through a sieve. To the milk in which 
they were boiled, add enough more, one-half pint, add the 
yolks of four eggs slightly beaten, one saltspoonful of salt, 
one-half saltspoonful of pepper, and cook until thick, then 
add the artichokes and the white of one egg beaten very 
stiff. Put the mixture into a well buttered mold and steam

for one hour, covering the mold on top with a white paper 
well buttered, then let it become very cold in the refrigera- 
tor. When required, turn from the mold and serve with a 
mayonnaise. 

CUSTARD SOUFFLE. 

Two scant tablespoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls 
flour, beat these well together until light and smooth, then 
pour gradually over one cup of boiling milk, and cook all 
for eight minutes, stirring constantly. Beat together the 
yolks of four eggs and two" tablespoonfuls of sugar, add to 
the cooked mixture and put away to cool. When cold, add 
the whites of the eggs beaten until stiff; put all into a 
buttered baking dish and bake for twenty minutes in a 
moderate oven. 

SUMMER SQUASH-FRIED. 

Cut the squash into slices one-fourth of an inch in 
thickness, dip these into flour well seasoned with salt and 
pepper, fry in hot butter or good fresh beef dripping until 
brown. 

FONTAINBLEU CHEESE. 

One quart of fresh milk, stir into it one teaspoonful of 
liquid rennet (the milk must be made just blood warm), 
only stir slightly. As soon as the milk is thick, stir to sep- 
arate the curd from the whey, then drain and add two 
tablespoonsful of cream. Line some small wooden molds 
which have perforated bottoms, with cheese cloth ; place in 
these the cheese ; let-it drain for two or three days, then 
remove from molds and serve with salt or sugar and cream. 

GREEN PEPPERS AND CHICKEN. 

Boil two green peppers for ten minutes, cut off the tops, 
remove the seeds, and chop very fine. Mixthe minced pep- 
pers with two cupsful of finely chopped cold chicken,

six tablespoonsful of crushed macaroons, eight tablespoons- 
ful of finely chopped suet, one-half teaspoonful of salt, the 
rind of one lemon grated, six tablespoonsful of sugar, three 
eggs, beaten together; mix well and put into a buttered 
dish and bake for two hours in a moderate oven. 

JAVELLE ^YATER. 

One pound of sal soda, one quart of water, boil together 
until the soda is all dissolved. While this is being done, put 
one quarter of a pound of chloride of lime into one quart of 
water; let it settle, pour off all the clear liquid and add it 
to the liquid soda ; bottle and keep for removing stains from 
linen. 

JUGGED CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken, which may be an old fat one or a 
young one, into pieces the same as for fried chicken ; for 
every pound of chicken take one tablespoonful of flour, 
which season well with salt and pepper ; roll each piece of 
chicken in this flour, then pack the chicken closely into an 
earthenware crock and cover with cold water ; cover the 
crock and bake for two hours, if a young chicken is used ; 
three, if an old one, in a moderate but steady oven ; the 
chicken requires no stirring.
