Introduction 

The family that must make every dollar of its income bring in one 
hundred cents' worth of well being for its members has a truly vital 
interest in the food problem. Jn order to make sure that the ration 
is satisfactory the housekeeper must see to it that every dollar spent for 
food furnishes a dollar's worth of strength. 

The ration allowance on which Miss Weeks has based the present 
work was planned for a group of families in Xew York City, and, con- 
sidering their limitations of income met in a fairly satisfactory way 
their food needs. 

( )bviouslv, the immediate aim in determining a safe minimum for 
the family food allowance was to help the family make the best of the 
situation. Even larger issues, however, were involved. Before a truly 
satisfactory ration could be outlined it was necessary to know the dan- 
ger line, or rather the safety line below which it was not possible to go. 
The matter of reasonable leeway could then be more easily determined. 

It is hoped that the present pamphlet may be of some service to 
those who are concerned with this problem of low cost dietaries. It 
seemed best to publish the calculations on which the work is based since 
these may prove of interest in the case of those whose responsibility 
lies along the line of helping to develop the literature of this subject. 

The unit system is used since this seems the most convenient way 
to approximate food needs for a group of families. Individual dietaries 
would of course be calculated upon the basis of individual needs.

TESTED MENUS AND RECIPES 

Based on a 
Low Cost Dietary 

In order to demonstrate that attractive and palatable menus can be 
planned from a low cost dietary and that sufficient variety can be intro- 
duced to continue the use of these foods from week to week, the interest 
of several women in menus and recipes was secured and the results 
obtained are set forth in this Bulletin. 

The food supply for the week is based on the minimum dietary for 
three units used for a number of years by Winifred S. Gibbs in New 
York City. Some changes were made to suit the needs and tastes of the 
individual families. 

Fbe first part of the plan was carried out by a painter's family, 
consisting of a man, lii^ wife, and three boys of 12. 10 and 8 years re- 
spectively. The woman took great interest in trying out the menus pre- 
pared by the writer and made only a few minor changes. 

In order to meet the needs of the family, lunches were planned for 
the man and dinner was made the evening meal. Xo change was made 
for the boys as they are in the habit of eating heartily at night, but it 
would be preferable, for the good of the children, to exchange the noon 
and evening meals. Cheese was omitted and an extra pound of beef 
substituted to suit the family's taste. 

The percentage of protein was kept high at the expense of greater 
variety to provide for the growing children. For the same reason little 
of the milk was used for cooking as a large part of it was given the 
children to drink as milk or cocoa. 

Additions of one slice each were made by the woman to the bread 
allowance for two breakfasts, and on two afternoons each of the three 
boys bad a slice of bread and nut butter for lunch. Nevertheless there 
were small amounts of several articles left at the end of the week. Had 
the menus been used in cold weather more energy would have been ex- 
pended and without doubt the full amount of food required. Afore- 
over, the allowance for the children was high as in the unit system of 
reckoning children of several ages are grouped together. 

A saving in the cost of supplies for the week could have been made 
if stores which do not deliver had been patronized.

PART II. 

Many women have been trained in the school of necessity to use 
the foods which are low in cost but high in food value. That some have 
profited by their experience is shown by the menus and recipes included 
in Part 11 which were prepared by women accustomed to managing on 
a small income. 

The list of foods used in I 'art 1 was the basis, but a few substitutes 
were allowed as follows :

FAMILY B.— American. 

Man, woman, 6 children (3 to 17 years). 

Number of units, 5.8. 

Number of calories per week. 121,800. 

Cost per unit per day, 41 cents. 
In this family the total cost of food for the week was $16.62, and 
150,122 calories were provided, an excess of over 28,000 above the 
number recpiired. This is accounted for by the use of an abundance of 
fats, sugar, bread, and potatoes. Three lunches daily were put up for 
the working members of the family. Several homemade cakes were 
included in the menus as well as some puddings and pie, as a dessert or 
sweet of some sort was generally served for both dinner and supper. 

FAMILY C— Italian. 

Man, woman, 7 children ( 5 months to 14 years ) . 
Number of units. 5.0. 
Number of calories per week, 117.01 Hi. 
Cosl per day per unit. 28 cents. 

The cost per 100 calories of foods used for the week was the lowest 
in this family, being $.009 against $.011 in Families A and II and in 
Parti. The menus were, however, correspondingly low in protein and 
high in fat and starch, a criticism characteristic of Italian diet in fam- 
ilies without American training. 

As a result of 10 cooking lessons given the 14 year old girl there 
were included in the menus a number of the recipes taught, as split pea 
soup, beef stew, codfish chowder, and American chop suey. 

Whereas the use of main of the foods included in the list is com- 
mon to families of various nationalities, combinations vary widely and 
a few recipes will be of value.
