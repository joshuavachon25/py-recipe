TF YOU are a woman upon whose knowledge of 
■*■ food values, and upon whose skill and common 
sense in cookery, no life depends — 

If you are one who is satisfied to cook food on 
the old recipes which may or may not provide the 
balanced ration — 

Or, if you are one who believes that ingredients 
whose trademark provides no guarantee of nutri- 
tion or clean manufacture are just as good as 
those which do — 

Then— 

This Woman's World Calendar Cook Book will 
not appeal to you. 

But to every woman who is interested to know 
what good food is, the first necessity of nwinkind. 
and its proper selection, preparation, cooking and 
serving, this book will have a very strong appeal. 

Dyspepsia is caused by overfeeding, un3er-eat- 
ing, eating irregularly and hurriedly, taking too 
much of one food and not enough of another, and 
by not having the balance right. '-.^ 

With too much food, the furnace is stuffed until 
the fires of life are choked by the excess of good 
fuel. 

With inadequate meals or unbalanced combina 
tions, growth is stunted, and energy dies. 

The Food That Counts Is the Pood That 
Digests 

The Woman's World Calendar Cook Book 
points out plainly the scientific selection of 
foods — 

Gives the careful preparation and mixing of in- 
gredients — 

Furnishes the practical knowledge of the time 
required and the manner of cooking, preserving or 
canning — 

Brings out the attractive appearance of food 
for the satisfaction of the appetite — 

Shows hundreds of new combinations of nutri- 
tious cookery — 

But— 

Its larger purpose is to bring out clearly the 
accurate facts on the values of foods and how to 
retain these values through proper methods of 
cooking and to emphasize the Economy and Nutri- 
tion of the Balanced Ration as against the hap- 
hazard choice, in order to prolong life, and to give 
a greater joy in living. 

Woman's World Calendar Cook Book contains 
Balanced Menus for a week in every month with 
variations for every meal — every day in the year. 

It has 250 Tested Recipes, made in a home 
Kitchen — 12 Monthly Messages on good ingre- 



dients and their preparation — Canning and Pre- 
serving Charts — Baking, Roasting and Boiling 
Time Tables — and practical articles on Child 
Feeding and other vital subjects in Home Eco- 
nomics.

BESIDES being an ideal 
spread for bread, Beech- 
Nut Peanut Butter is just the 
filler to give flavor and char- 
acter to candies, cakes and 
the like. Truly delicious in 
itself, it blends agreeably with 
many kinds of food. Use it 
in pastry, confectionery, fruit 
puddings, sandwiches and 
numerous desserts. You'll be 
delighted at the really deli- 
cious results obtainable from 
it. Our booklet, * 'One Hundred

WOMAN'S WORLD CALENDAR COOK BOOK 

THE BALANCED RATION 
"%ur Meals and Good Healtlv 



V 



AKIETY is the spice of life- 
the essence of life. 



-and it is also 



Our bodies must get from the food that we eat 
the tissue for its cells — energy for instant use — 
or storage for the future — mineral salts, vita- 
mines, water and a certain roughage from vege- 
tables and fruits to aid in proper elimination. 

When we do not balance our ration, but leare 
out of our diet any food upon which our bodies 
depend we throw the machinery out of gear by 
making it work overtime to secure enough tissue 
or energy from other foods to repair the loss. 

It is of the greatest importance to strengthen 
our bodies and brighten our minds — by a little 
common sense in the daily selection and prepara- 
tion of the food we eat. 

Living by the balanced ration is simply giving 
the body and the brain a chance to do its best as 
nature intended, by giving it the right nourish- 
ment every day in the year. 

We have set forth in the Woman's World Cal- 
endar Cook Book the correct diet with the newest 
food combinations — with the idea of providing 
sufficient nutriment from our food for every one 
of every age — with the greatest amount of econ- 
omy in its selection and preparation. 

Our bodies are made up of various parts — 
there's fat, bone, muscle, brain and nerve tissue, 
all of which are being constantly expended as we 
think and move, even to repair this waste ; and 
food, plus the right amount of water, has to be 
regulated. 

The following foods should be present in every 
meal : One protein or muscle-maker, two or three 
starches or energy foods, one or two fats or re- 
serve-force foods, one sweet or quick energizer, 
one or two roughage or bulky foods, some min- 
erals, at least one protective food, and a half pint 
of water. 

If you have a boy who can't get "filled up" — a 
daughter with a blotched skin — a husband who is 
always tired — and if you, yourself, are nervous 
and fretty, just give this balanced ration a thor- 
ough trial. 

The Balanced Ration 

In order to make the proper balancing of meals 
simple, we have listed the foods according to the 
special mission they have in the body. 

Muscle-Makers: (One of these for each meal.) 

Milk, skimmed milk, eggs, meat, fish, dried 
peas, dried beans, nuts, peanut butter, all kinds 
of cheese. 

Heat Foods: (Two of these for each meal.) 

All cereals, all breads — ^whether made with bak- 
ing powder, soda or yeast — crackers, macaroni, 
spaghetti, and noodles, bananas, all puddings 
that include bread crumbs, flour, cornstarch, 
tapioca, cereals. 

Quick Energy Foods: (One of these for each meal.) 
The sweets, all kinds of syrups — such as maple 
syrup, honey molasses, sorghum and cornsyrup; 
jellies and preserves, frostings, candies, sweet 
puddings, plain sugar as served in coffee, tea 
and on fresh fruit. 




Keserv© Foods, that supply stored-up energy: (Two 
of these for each meal.) 
All the fats — this means butter, nut and animal 
margarine: peanut butter, cream, top milk, all 
sal^ad oils, very fat ham, pork or bacon, very fat 
fish, sausages, cream cheese, all salad dressings, 
rich gravies, cake and pastry containing a great 
deal of shortening, most nuts, chocolate, and all 
puddings and cakes containing nauch fat — 
as suet puddings: also fried foods, such as fried 
potatoes, croquettes, etc. 

Tonic Foods: (One or more of these for each meal.) 
All fresh green vegetables, as cabbage, cucum- 
bers, celery, tomatoes, all salad plants, etc.; 
rhubarb, peaches, strawberries, pears, grapes 
and all fresh and dried fruits, except bananas: 
all fruit drinks, canned fruits and fruit ices all 
whole grain cereals, such as cracked wheat, 
brown rice, cornmeal ground at the mill, etc. 

The Koughage (or bullcy) Foods: (One or more of 
these for each meal.) 
Includes all of the Tonic Poods, as well as all of 
the coarse breads, such as graham, entire wheat 
and rye — all the gritty cereals, all the coarse 
vegetables — as lettuce, onions, asparagus, cab- 
bage, etc.: all unpared fruits or those which 
are full of seeds — as well as all of the bulky 
green vegetables. 

The liiquid Foods: (Two of these tor each meal.) 

Water, all soups, small amounts of tea or coffee, 
skimmed milk, buttermilk, cocoa, all fruit 
drinks, all o4;her drinks (not alcoholic) : gela- 
tines, ices, watery fruits and vegetables. 

Growing or Protective Foods. (Choose two of these 
or at least one for each meal.) 
Milk, butter, eggs, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, 
whole grains. 



Let Eacli Play Its Part 

As we learn to plan and cook rightly we soon 
become accustomed to thinking of the different 
materials we put into the dishes and find that it 
is not necessary to supply eight or ten dishes for 
each meal, as some may have thought after read- 
ing through the list of foods, but rather to think 
what goes into each one separately. 

In the well-planned meal there' are no acces- 
sories. When sugar, for example, is used in the 
coffee, tea or cocoa, or on the cereal, that sup- 
plies the necessary sweet for the meal. Bread 
acts as one of the heat foods, and the butter or 
margarine served on it is one of the foods that 
supplies stored-up force. It isn't necessarj' — ^if 
large amounts of bread and butter are eaten — to 
supply any other reserve-force food in the meal. 

A balanced meal can be selected by anyone by 
applying the simple principles I have mentioned. 
Properly selected meals mean efficiency, keener 
judgment, clear-headedness, a comfortable feeling 
after meals— and all it costs is the expenditure of 
enough time to understand the list of foods and to 
select them according to the simple laws of har- 
mony and body needs.

About Canned Foods 



MUCH has been said and written about 
canned foods; but, when finally sifted 
down, the question really presents the 
following aspects: 

How do canned articles compare in food 
value with fresh foods? 

Are they as clean as foods put up at home? 

Are they more expensive? 

The food value of canned articles is prac- 
tically the same as when the foods are pre- 
pared at home. However, the process of can- 
ning takes away most of the vitamines, and, 
because of this, it is not advisable to plan a 
dietary based largely upon canned foods. This 
means that canned foods should appear in 
the menu in balanced combination with fresh 
foods containing vitamines, as milk, eggs, 
cheese, etc. Example: Cream of spinach 
soup, escalloped brown rice, tomatoes and 
cheese. 

Canned Foocls Are Usually Cheaper 
Than Fresh Foods 

In most cases it is cheaper to buy canned 
foods than those that are fresh,, even if the 
cost of preparation and fuel is not considered. 
Standard brands of canned tongue, veal loaf, 
pressed beef and corned beef for certain 
processes of cookery are quite as adaptable 
as those that are home prepared. As to 
canned vegetables, they cost about the sajne 
as the home-prepared products, provided the 
latter are not home-grown, but it is a good 
rule to introduce the fresh vegetable in the 
menu when it is in season, for the vitamine 
element, rather than the canned vegetable. 
When the canned vegetable is used, let it be 
in the form of a salad into which a fresh, 
raw vegetable, as lettuce, radishes, celery, 
cabbage or even raw onions may be featured, 
or as a milk soup, or with poached eggs. 

Commercially-Canned Products More Eco- 
nomical Than Home Canned Foods 

Unless there is a large supply of fresh 
fruits on the home place, so that it is not 
necessary to purchase fruit for canning, it is 
not an economy to put them up at home, for, 
with the cost of both sugar and fruit, home 
canned fruit is as expensive as the commer- 
cial product. Fresh fruit the year round is 
the best possible insurance against autointox- 
ication, sluggish livers and frequent head- 



aches, although canned fruit is very useful 
when fresh fruit cannot be had. 

With the agitation for pure foods is the 
necessity for clean products, for that which 
is not clean cannot be pure. 

The Kind to Buy 

The housewife should be sure to buy the 
known brands which stand for purity in 
manufacture. The names of reputable firms, 
whose kitchens are constantly open for in- 
spection, mean cleanliness. I have seen hun- 
dreds of home kitchens and have also been 
through many manufacturing plants produc- 
ing food products, and in nearly every case 
the commercial ingredients were of the best 
grade, and the manufacturing kitchens were 
cleaner than those in the homes. 

Comhining Canned Poods with Fresh — 
For Vitamines 

Canned foods should be combined, if pos- 
sible, with something which will give either 
a fresh raw or freshly-cooked taste. Canned 
pears become another food if sharpened with 
a little lemon juice; a fruit cup of canned 
pineapple and cherries is more nutritious with 
a little sliced orange. Thus fish salad, com- 
bined with diced celery or lettuce hearts and 
garnished with radish roses, is both appetiz- 
ing and complete. The living principles 
needed by canned foods are thus introduced, 
giving the true balance. 

All canned foods are better if turned from 
the can at least a half hour before using and 
expose to the air to freshen, or re-oxygenize. 
This applies also to canned soups. Canned 
fish, as tuna and salmon, should be scalded 
before using. All vegetables of a firm na- 
ture, as asparagus, peas, Lima beans, etc., 
and canned spinach, should be drained, the 
liquor being used as sauce or the foundation 
for a soup. 

Many housewives seem to think that be- 
cause a meat is canned and, therefore 
cooked, it should be served plain. This makes 
it seem expensive and not particularly at- 
tractive. Canned meat is, however, most 
adaptable to made dishes. It should never 
be used entirely in the place of fresh meat. 
But the made fish from canned meat or fish, 
if combined with other ingredients, will often 
solve a luncheon or supper problem. All 
canned foods should be changed to another 
container immediately upon opening.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

As this is the season when quite a bit of acid 
should be gradually introduced into the menu, 
the citrus fruits and grape fruit can be used 
plentifully. The dried fruits may be used inter- 
changeably as they give bulk. If the family seems 
to be suffering from colds, try serving a glass- 
full of rather sour lemonade, all round, either 
in the evening, or a half hour before breakfast. 
The bread, both yeast and quick, should be made 
up — as far as possible — of whole grains. Fried 
foods should be avoided as much as possible. 
Broiled, smoked salmon, or smoked white fish, 
can be substituted for bacon. The Swedish omelet 
may be supplanted by tomato, or spinach, omelet ; 
and oven-browned cereal may be served, instead of 
creamed potatoes. 

Luncheon or Supper 

Escalloped eggs, potatoes, or spinach may be 
substituted for the escalloped cheese — ^while 
canned fruit may be used instead of stewed, dried 
fruit. Corn, potato, or tomato chowder will al- 
ways be welcomed, and any of the hot desserts 



will be delicious, especially on a rather cold day 
(in this case, a special substitute dish will have to 
be provided for the youngsters if the dessert is 
over-rich ) . As for general use, bread pudding, 
any form of cereal puddings, warm gingerbread, 
upside-down pies, or baked fruit dumplings are 
always acceptable. 

Dinner 

Any broiled meat may he substituted for the 
pork chops ; instead of meat loaf, Hamburg steak 
balls may be provided ; and to vary the meatless 
menu on Tuesday, nut cutlets, or rice and nut 
loaf may be provided. Any broiled fish may re- 
place the broiled mackerel, or halibut. A fri- 
cassee of lamb may be used instead of that of 
chicken, and a casserole of chicken, veal, or lamb 
may be used instead of beef. As to vegetables, 
try to put in those which are bulky, and introduce 
as many of the fresh vegetables as possible. 
Serve fruit freely as dessert, or introduce fruit 
juices in the form of tapiocas, gelatine, and 
so on. Salads should be used frequently, the 
French dressing being made with lemon juice, 
instead of vinegar, to stimulate the liver.

Yeast Bread Making 



THE exact science of bread making is a 
chemical one, consisting of the proper 
blending of flour, licLuid, salt and yeast 
into a dough which is raised by the growth in 
it of the yeast fungi. During that raising the 
action of the yeast converts part of the starch 
into a form of sugar; and the yeast cells, 
feeding on this, produce fermentation; and 
as the dough is fermented and raised, thou- 
sands of little cells, or pockets, are formed in 
it. During the baking, ho'wever, the fermen- 
tation is stopped by the heat, the result being 
the light, porous bread with which we are 
familiar. 

Bread making is a process which needs the 
utmost care. There is nothing difficult about 
it, but it must be done with exactness in re- 
gard to measurements, mixing, temperatures 
and cooking. 

Unfortunately, most of us use but one kind 
of bread, quite forgetting that "variety is the 
spice of life" and that there are various forms 
of bread, which would give the much needed 
change to our diet — ^whole wheat, graham, rye 
or corn bread — or breads made of a combina- 
tion of grains, such as Boston Brown Bread. 
These grains introduce vi famines into the 
diet, making it unnecessary to use so many 
other mineral foods. They give greater bulk, 
which is also necessary, and we should look 
upon bread as a food and not merely as an 
accessory. It is our best food if properly 
made of the right ingredients. 

Proper Kind of Ingredients 

What are these ingredients? Flour, salt, 
liquid and yeast. These four we must have, 
others we may have, and even with these four 
some variations are possible. As already 
stated, the flour may be of more than one va- 
riety, but some wheat flour we must have for 
good bread. The liquid may be plain water, 
water in which potatoes have been cooked, or 
milk, or two of these in combination. The 
yeast may be compressed or dry yeast accord- 
ing to convenience. Other ingredients may be 
potatoes, shortening and a little sugar or 
syrup. 

Whereas, the methods of making bread by 
both dry and compressed yeast are practically 
identical, the process when making it with 
dry yeast is facilitated if a soft sponge is first 
made, so that the little yeast plants may have 
all possible assistance in their growth. It is 
also advisable to make such a sponge when 
preparing coffee cake or rolls, or whenever a 
fine textured result is desired or when rich- in- 
gredients are being used, no matter what kind 
of yeast is chosen. Success in bread making 



consists in the use of a reliable recipe; care in 
keeping the rising dough at a temperature of 
not less than 70° F., nor more than 95° F.; 
shielding the dough from draughts, and the 
proper baking. 

The Sponge 

So in making a sponge, or in starting bread 
without a sponge, the liquid must be merely 
tepid — or blood heat. If milk is used, it should 
be first scalded to kill any bacteria that might 
cause it to sour w^hile the bread-rising process 
is going on. 

To this liquid is added the yeast, first 
softened and dissolved in a little liquid re- 
served for the purpose or an extra amount 
specified in the recipe. Then in making the 
sponge a little of the sugar, the salt, and a 
small portion of flour are added, usually twice 
as much as liquid. When light and spongy, 
the remaining ingredients are added, the mix- 
ture kneaded, set covered to use until doubled 
in bulk, then "cut down," shaped, and set to 
rise until doubled again, when it is ready to 
bake. 

Baking 

The baking process must be fairly slow at a 
moderate heat, so that the vitamines will be 
preserved and the bread be dried out thor- 
oughly, 375° F. being the best temperature 
to maintain. During the last five minutes of 
the baking the oven should be cooled off — so 
that no further browning takes place — the 
steam being merely dried out. 

The use of a bread-mixer facilitates bread 
making, obviating kneading by hand and 
actually saving a fourth of the flour. As these 
mixers may be obtained in both ' small and 
large sizes they are practipal for use In every 
family. And once the housewife has learned 
how to make not only the /delicious loaf 
breads, but dainty rolls, raised muflins, raisin 
ahiS nut breads, coffee cake of many kinds, 
brioche the "bread dessert" and other delight- 
ful dishes learned by yeast, by accurate and 
simple processes, she will look upon the day 
she bakes with yeast not only as a triumph 
of good cookery — but as a milestone on the 
road to good health for her family. 

It is just as essential that the bread be 
properly cared for after it, Is baked as dur- 
ing the cooking process. Place the fresh 
loaves on a wire rack or on the shelf of the 
gas range — and let them be perfectly cold be- 
fore putting into the bread box or crock. 
This, by the way, should be scalded twice a 
week and thoroughly dried, preferably in the 
open air.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

There are many ways of introducing different 
foods into this meal. Take baking powder bis- 
cuits, for instance, they can be very quickly made 
if the dry ingredients are sifted together the night 
before and the shortening is rubbed into them. In 
the morning, one has merely to add the moisten- 
ing, pat them out on a floured board, shape them, 
and bake them while the table is being laid and 
the other foods are being assembled. They can be 
served not only hot with butter, with honey, 
syrup, jam, or jelly, but are particularly good if 
split open and served with a cream gravy and a 
garnish of fried salt pork or bacon, with frizzled 
dried beef, or with flaked salt codfish heated in a 
cream gravy. 

Luncheon or Supper ' ' 

Luncheon and supper are the meals at which 
left-overs can be utilized to good advantage and in 
which made dishes appear. Take, for instance, the 
menu for Monday, with its Tomato Bouillon made 
of left-over canned tomato, a little carrot, some 
onion and some bouillon cubes ; the salad made of 
left-over potatoes and the crumb griddle cakes con- 
taining ground dry bread crumbs. These may be 
varied by the substitution of similar left-overs in 
the different dishes. On Tuesday we have Corn 
and Lima Bean Soup — again, of left-overs ; this 
might well be supplanted by a Cream of Celery, 
Pumpkin, or Spinach Soup. 




As to desserts, the Apple Sauce Cake may be 
varied by prune or peach cake ; the griddle cakes 
by waffles or hot muffins ; the stewed dried peaches 
by figs, dates, prunes, or apricots ; the blanc 
mange by any tapioca or cornstarch pudding, the 
spice cookies with ginger snaps, cream cookies, or 
peanut cookies ; and the dumplings by a cobbler, 
shortcake, or fruit pie. 

Dinner 

The short ribs of beef may be varied by the use 
of a pot roast, flank steak, or meat loaf; the 
thick oxtail stew by a lamb or veal stew, or 
fricassee ; the roast spare ribs by ham baked in 
milk, or fresh roast shoulder of pork ; the casser- 
ole of lamb by a casserole or fricassee of chicken, 
veal, or beef ; the old-fashioned fish pie by a fish 
loaf, oyster chowder, or escallop of salmon, or 
tuna fish ; the baked macaroni Hamburg by meat 
balls, braised round steak, or veal, or pork chops. 

For dessert, use warm gingerbread or cereal 
pudding instead of cottage puffs ; snow pudding 
or jellied fruits instead of cherry Spanish cream ; 
any tapioca dish instead of blanc mange ; butter- 
scotch or chocolate pie instead of cream tarts; 
pineapple or fig and orange fruit cup instead of 
prune and orange cup ; steamed fig or chocolate 
pudding instead of steamed carrot pineapple pud- 
ding ; and grape juice or coffee sponge instead of 
lemon snow pudding.

Thin White Sauce 

(For use in creaming vegetables) 



1 tablespoon butter 
1 tablespoon flour 
% teaspoon salt 



Few grains pepper 
1 cup milk 



Medium Thick Wliite Sauce 

(For use in creaming meats, fish, eggs, in mak- 
ing creamed vegetable sauces for meats, and in 
certain scalloped dishes.) 



2 tablespoons butter 
2 tablespoons flour 
Vi teaspoon salt 



Few grains pepper 
1 cup milk 



Ya teaspoon pepper 
1 cup milk 



Thick White Sauce 

(For use in binding together croquettes, certain 
scalloped dishes and fish and meat loaves.) 

4 tablespoons butter 

% cup flour 

^ teaspoon salt 

All of these sauces are made as follows : Melt 
butter in a medium-sized saucepan, lift it over to 
edge of range, and stir in flour and seasonings. 
Return to heat and add milk, a little at a time, 
stirring with each addition so that flour will take 
up all of liquid before more is added. Continue 
in this way until all liquid is in, then bring sauce 
to boiling point, and let it simmer a moment or 
two, when it is ready to use.

Be Lavish 

With 

Raisins 



:^ 



It's Justified by Dietetic Worth 

Raisins are a fruit-food that you should serve in many ways, because of their 
nutrition and health values. 

They furnish 1560 units of energizing nutriment per pound. More energy 
than eggs, milk, meat or fish. 

They are 75 per cent pure fruit sugar in practically pre-digested form, so their 
good is almost immediately assimilated. 

They also furnish food-iron and valuable organic salts. Children especially, 
shouldn't get all their iron from meat. 

Put raisins in oatmeal and in their cookies, cakes and breads. 

Serve bread puddings, boiled rice and stewed prunes with raisins. 

Raisins make plain foods delicious, so people welcome them. Thus raisins will 
help you keep the food bills down. 

Be lavish with them — you can afford to, when they bring you such returns. 

Get a package now and use them freely. 

SUN-MAID 
RAISINS 

Three varieties: — San-Maid Seeded {seeds remooej); Sun-Maid Seedless 
(groan withoul seeds); Sun-Maid Clusters {on the stem). All dealers 
sell them.

The Values of Dried Fruits 



ALTHOUGH a great deal has been said 
about the value of dates, flgs, raisins, 
dried peaches, prunes and other dried 
fruits, there are too many households in 
which these foods are only occasionally 
served. 

These dried fruits mentioned are bulky, 
and, further, they all contain certain laxative 
principles, particularly prunes and figs. They 
are all mineral foods and have a fine effect 
upon the blood and assist in digestion. 

Dates and coconuts come from palms, the 
fibre of which has much the same use, but 
the date is rich in sugar, while the coconut 
surpasses in oil. The milk of the coconut 
and its soft, fleshy pulp make it one of our 
best body builders. 

The fruit sugar in dates, figs, prunes and 
raisins is easily assimilated. Therefore, these 
foods are especially good for children, and 
being natural sugars they do not add flesh. 

When these fruits are used, the amount of 
sugar specified in the recipe may be reduced. 
Locke, in "Pood Values," says that "ten large 
dates contain 58.61 grams of carbohydrates; 
ten large flgs contain 144.69 grams; ten very 
large prunes contain 124.41, and ten very 
large raisins contain 17.31 grams." This tells 
its own story. 

Ways to Vary the Diet 
The following menus illustrate some new 
ways in which these fruits may be intro- 
duced: 

Breakfast 

Prunes, Pigs, Raisins or Dates Cooked with 

Cracked Wheat, Hominy or Brown Rice 

Top Milk Toast and Butter 

Coffee with Hot Milk (Adults) 

Cocoa (Children) 

liuncheon or Supper 

Eggs Shirred on Creamed Rice 

Bran Muffins and Butter 

Tomato Salad 

Dried Peach or Norwegian Prune Pudding 

Tea (Adults) 

Dinner 

Oven Braised Steak Escalloped Potatoes 

Corn on the Cob Bread and Butter 

Pickled Beets 

Fig Pudding Melted Jelly Sauce 

Coffee (Adults) 

Sunday Night Supper — No. 1 

Toasted Minced Ham Sandwiches 

Date and Orange Salad 

Coconut Drops Molasses Cookies Tea 

Sunday Night Supper — No. 2 

Welsh Rarebit on Crackers Celery 

Dried Peach or Raisin Pie Coffee 



AXtemooii Tea 

No. 1 : Date and Cream Cheese Sandwiches Tea 
No. 2 : Date Kisses Hot Chocolate 

Here Are Some New Ideas 

Prunes, at last, haV^e come into their own. 
Pitted, stewed, or soft uncooked prunes, com- 
bined with sliced peaches and honey salad 
dressing, served on lettuce. 
French Toast for luncheon, served with a 
sauce made of pitted, stewed prunes and their 
juice, thickened with a tablespoon each of 
butter and flour rubbed together, to each 
cup of liquid. 

Raw prunes, ground or chopped fine, added 
to veal, tongue, or chicken and used as stuff- 
ing for green peppers. 

Figs Are Delicious 

Try them baked en Casserole and served 
warm with marshmallows. 
Or, in Ice Cream, made with three cups of 
rich custard, a cup of heavy cream or evapor- 
ated milk undiluted and one and a half cups 
of chopped, dried figs cooked for half an hour 
with a cup of water. 

Short Cake, made of rich biscuit dough, baked 

in two layers, well buttered and put together 

with figs stewed until soft, with a grating of 

orange rind — served with whipped or plain 

cream has a new delicious flavor. 

Dates can be more quickly used than many 

of the dried fruits, because they are so tender 

and need no soaking. Try: 

Stirring halved, stoned dates into orange 
gelatine just as it begins to congeal. 
Spread saltines with cream cheese and butter 
creamed together, then lay on halved stoned 
dates. 

Put equal parts of stoned dates and English 
walnut meats through the food-chopper. Add 
a little butter and use as a filling for whole 
wheat or graham bread sandwiches. 
The pleasant tartness of raisins and 
peaches makes them adaptable to combina- 
tion with meats. 

Try This 
Combine one-half cup of tart jelly and one- 
half cup of boiling water. Add one-fourtli 
cup Of raisins, or diced soaked peaches, cook 
until tender and thicken with one-half table- 
spoon of cornst.arch, dissolved in a little cold 
water. 

Or: Apples, cored, filled with halved raisins 
or cooked dried peaches or apricots and baked 
with brown sugar syrup. 
A salad of equal parts of diced apples and 
celery and n generous numner ot raisins, a 
few nut-meats and boiled dressing to blend.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

Any seasonable fruit, or stewed, dried fruit 
may be used. Vary the cereals by the use of corn- 
meal mush, cracked wheat and brown rice. Use 
scrambled eggs with tomatoes, or raisins, or ham ; 
or creamed dried beef, or fish cakes. Occasion- 
ally, make coffee cake, or some other raised bread. 

Luncheon or Supper' 

Substitute salmon, or codfijsh salad for the tuna 
fish. Use griddle cakes, or French toast, instead 
of waffles. Use any kind of substantial vegetable 
soups, instead' of those enumerated. Try baked 
cheese, instead of Welsh Rarebit, and EscaUoped 
'Potatoes with Sausage, instead of bacon. Vary 



the cookies from week to week and use a simple 
sponge cake, instead of gingerbread. 

Dinner 

Substitute veal for chicken; fried, for broiled 
fish ; fresh pork, for roast Virginia ham ; boiled 
lamb, for spiced beef; creamed oysters, for fish 
balls ; and Lima beans and tomato sauce, for 
Boston baked beans. Try caramel marshmallow 
pudding for Monday ; cereal pudding for Tuesday ; ' 
a cream or chocolate cake for. Wednesday ; baked 
custard, or pumpkin pie for Thursday; a simple 
steamed pudding or apple cake for Friday; and 
a fruit shortcake for Saturday. On Sunday the 
dessert should be simple — a floating island, fudge 
pudding, or Bavarian cream being suitable.

■'• more of the fat than is absolutely necessary. 
Heat a frying pan and just before placing the ham 
in it, sprinkle a very little sugar — not more than 
one-half teaspoon — over the bottom of the pan. 
Fry the ham gently — the sugar will help it to 
brown and will give a rich and delicate flavor. 

Ham which has been boiled before frying is 
very much more tender than when uncooked ham 
is used. 

If the ham is very lean, put one tablespoon of 
fat into the pan before frying.

ters of an hour, then pour soup over eggs and 
cream which have been beaten together, stirring

more flour if necessary. Cover and set in a warm 
place to rise for about three hours or until dough 
has doubled its bulk. Divide into two portions, 
knead until smooth, place in oiled pans and again 
set aside to rise until doubled in bulk. Brush

The grated rind of half 

an orange 
Strained juice one orange 

SIFT confectioner's sugar, add grated orange 
rind and moisten with orange juice. (If or- 
ange is a very large one entire juice may not be 
needed. On the other hand, if orange is small a 
little water may be needed to moisten frosting 
sufficiently.) To one-half of this mixture add

moistened with the cold water. Boil thoroughly, 
then pour the thickened juice over prunes in 
deep baking dish, cover with a rich, short crust 
and bake twenty to twenty-five minutes in mod- 
erate oven — 350° F. Serve hot or cold.

OIL a baking dish and place in' it alternate 
layers of rice and grated cheese, reserving 
two tablespoons of cheese. Add salt and paprika 
to stewed, sifted tomatoes, pour these over rice 
and cheese, sprinkle remaining cheese over top 
and bake in moderate oven — 350° F. — for half an 
hour. 

Scrambled Onions and E!gg;s 

4 eggs 

1 tablespoon butter 

% teaspoon salt 

CHOP or cut up onions coarsely. Melt butter 
in inner vessel of double boiler, put in eggs, 
lightly beaten, stir until they begin to set. Add 
seasonings and onions and continue to cook until 
eggs are set as for ordinary scrambled eggs. Pile 
high on slices of toast or garnish with fried corn- 
meal mush. 

This is a good luncheon dish and the addition 
of the left-over onions is an excellent extender 
when eggs are costly. Creamed celery, creamed 
oyster plant or creamed turnips may be substi- 
tuted for the onions. 



Casserole oi Cliicken and Rice 



1 — 3 to 4 pound chickej 
% cup rice, boileci 
3 cups chicken stool- 
1 cup milk

14 cup chicken fat 

1 small onion, grated 

Salt and pepper, as needed 



OOOK chicken until nearly tender in salted 
'-' water to cover, using a closely-covered kettle 
and simmering slowly, or cooking in fireless 
cooker. When done, separate it into sections anel 
thicken stock with chicken fat and flour mixed, 
adding the milk and more salt and pepper, if 
necessary. Mix together the boiled rice and 
thickened stock, add onion and place in casserole 
in layers with chicken. Set the whole in oven and 
cook slowly from forty to fifty minutes longer. 

If desired, the chicken can be baked until ten- 
der in a slow oven, if it is first disjointed, then 
placed in a bean pot, covered with salted water 
and cooked gently for about four hours.

eggs until light, add milk and pour into a hol- 
low in center of dry ingredients. Add butter and 
beat until light and smooth. Just before baking 
fold in stiifly beaten whites of eggs. Bake in hot, , 
well oiled waffle irons and serve as soon as cooked. 





WOMAN'S WORLD CALENDAR COOK BOOK 

Feeding The Youngsters 

Proper Kinds of Food — ^And Why 



FROM the time the child is, one pertinent 
principle governs his feeding — the ration 

must be balanced. That Is why the child 
thrives best, in the early months, on milk — 
mother's milk. If possible — modified, cow's 
milk, If it is necessary to use a substitute. 
As the child grows older, less and less dilu- 
tion is put into the cow's milk, until it is 
given to him in its natural form. 

But, when a modification is used, what is 
most generally chosen? After the first two 
or three months, when other modifications 
are generally used, barley w^ter, oatmeal 
water, or something of like nature is added 
to the plain milk. This is to make up a per- 
fectly balanced ration, or a series of meals 
for the child, in which food will be provided 
in the right proportion to nourish every part 
of the body — every bone; every muscle; 
every nerve; every morsel of tissue; — and, at 
the same time, to build up reserve force and 
strength. 

Solid Foods 

After the child is weaned from, the breast 
or the bottle and begins to take solid food, 
how should the meals be planned? First, a 
protein, or muscle-maker, should be provid- 
ed; there should be a starch or two; a fat 
that will be easily digested; plenty of min- 
erals and roughage foods; a little sweet for 
energy, and an ample supply of the protec- 
tlves that the child may have sufficient vita- 
mines upon which to base a splendid growth 
and future good health. This general pro- 
portioning of foods is the same whether the 
child is nine months old, or whether he is 
of high school age. 

Until the child is five or six years old, he 
should not be given meat every day — three 
times a week being sufficient. He should also 
be provided with a quart of milk a day, which 
may be taken plain, or in the form of soups 
or puddings, or with cereals. All of his 
bread should be of the whole grain variety, 
such as genuine entire wLcat — bread of gen- 
uine cornmeal, and the like. Plenty of 
brown rice should t ppear; there should be 
an ample supply of raisins, prunes and figs, 
and of the citrus fruits. 

A wide variety of vegetables should be pro- 
vided and they, by the way, should be 
steamed whenever possible, to conserve all 
of the food value. Eggs should be provided 
for use on days when meat does not appear 
in the menu. The child should never be 
given tea or coffee, but cocoa may be served 
once a day, in which case it should be made 
with "one-half milk. 

It is generally possible to include in the 



family meals the foods that the children 
should eat- — these, supplemented by the milk, 
forming a balanced ration. It is safe to say 
that the foods which are good for children 
are best for adults. For instance, let us con- 
sider a day's menu for a family in which 
there are several small children: 

Breakfast Menu 

Stewed Prunes or Figs 
Cracked Wheat with Milk 
Bacon or Eggs Toast Coffee 
The adults would normally eat all of the 
foods enumerated; the children would eat 
everything except the bacon and coffee, be- 
ing given, in addition to the milk on the 
cereal, a glassful to drink; if the weather is 
extremely cold, this could be given in the 
form of cocoa. Children over six, who are 
playing outdoors and are very active, might 
like a little bacon, baked until it is dry and 
crispy. 

Mid-day Menu 
Tender Boiled Beef 
Steamed Potatoes Carrots, Butter Sauce 
Entire Wheat Bread and Butter 
Celery Tapioca Cr-jam Coffee 

There would be a most excellent soup re- 
sulting from the liquid in which the meat 
was boiled. This could be used as broth for 
the very young children. They could also 
be given the potato, mashed, and the car- 
rots, diced fine. Children over three could 
have the celery; the bread and butter would, 
of course, be given to them, as would the 
tapioca cream, and they would have a bal- 
anced meal, if it is supplemented by a glass- 
ful of milk. As boiled beef is one of the 
most digestible of meats, a very little of it 
could be finely minced and given to the 
youngsters over two and a half years of age. 
In other words, the children will be properly 
fed without a bit of extra cooking. 

Supper 

As to the supper — suppose that the follow- 
ing meal was provided: 

Cream of Potato Soup 

Hot Entire Wheat Bread Toast and Butter 

Cold Meat or Fish Loaf 

Pickled Beets 

Baked Apple Sauce Gingerbread Tea 

The children would have the soup, toast, 

apple sauce, and gingerbread. Moreover, this 

would all be prepared ahead of time and 

they could be finished with their supper and 

into their little pajamas, ready for father's 

good-night kiss when he comes home, and 

his supper would be ready, too.

IN ALL recipes in this book calling for baking 
powder use "Royal." Better and finer food 
will be the result, and you will safeguard 
it against a possible dangerous compound. 

In any recipes calling for one teaspoonful of 
soda and two of cream of tartar, use two spoon- 
fuls of Royal, and leave the cream of tartar 
and soda out. You get better food and save 
much trouble and guess-work. 

Look out for baking powders containing any 
ingredient that is not in itself wholesome. Do 
not permit them to come into your house under 
any consideration. They may add an injurious 
substance to your food, destroying in part its 
digestibility. Doctors will tell you this. 

To be certain of using baking powder that 
is absolutely pure and which may be depended 
upon to give the best and most wholesome re- 
siilts, insist upon Royal Baking Powder — stand- 
ard the world over.

Cakes and Cake Making 



■ abi 
A. inf 



THERE is no department of cooking in 
which failures prevail more than in the 
making of cakes. The principal causes 
are lack of care in undei standing the recipe, 
carelessness in measuring or an inaccurate 
recipe. The type of recipe that is handed 
from housekeeper to housekeeper and calls 
for a "heaping teaspoon" or "a rounding 
tablespoon" or "butter the size of an egg" 
usually means failure. If the measurements 
are "level" specified in the recipe, it is prob- 
able that the recipe is rroperly proportioned. 

Concerning the selection of the Ingredients 
for cake, only the "best" give superlative re- 
sults. But what are the best ingredients? 
"The highest-priced eggs, the most costly 
butter and the creamiest milk?" Not neces- 
sarily; for we all learned during the War 
that excellent results could be obtained with 
other materials, such as margarine, one of 
the solidified cooking fats, or a liquid fat. We 
learned that storage or dried eggs, or a good, 
reliable egg powder, would give good results, 
and that skim milk, evaporated milk or even 
milk and water could be used to produce good 
cake. 

We found that whereas cheaper ingredi- 
ents may have been substituted for the mate- 
rials called for in the recipe, the choice was 
always the best of its kind. 

Granulated sugar is the best sweetening for 
cake-making. Brown sugar makes a moist 
cake, however, with longer keeping qualities; 
powdered or confectioner's sugar makes a 
dry cake. 

Pastry fluur always gives the best results, 
because it Is :iot so rich in gluten as a spring 
wheat flour. 

Good Extracts 

Cake should be flavored with good extracts. 
In recently conducting a cake contest I found 
that ninety-five per cent of the cakes sub- 
mitted were poor in this respect. 

Cakes which contain no shortening, as 
angel or sponge cake, may be baked in an 
un-oiled pan, but cakes containing fat should 
be baked in a pan rubbed with unsalted fat. 
For loaf cake, line the bottom of the pan 
with a thin piece of manlUa paper. 

The temperature of the oven for baking 
depends upon the cake; fruit or rich wedding 
cake demanding two and a half hours, with a 
very slow heat, about 225 degrees F. Sponge 
or angel cakes need a higher temperature, 
about 300 degrees F. A loaf cake, contain- 
ing shortening, demands a heat of about 350 
degrees F. and layer and cup cakes call for 



375 degrees F. In baking cake in the gas or 
kerosene oven, a small pan of cold water 
should be put in a corner of the oven, away 
from the cake. 

Cake Baking 

The time needed to bake a cake is divided 
into four periods. During the first quarter, 
little bubbles should appear all over the top. 
The second quarter, the cake should rise to 
full height and brown in freckles. The third 
quarter, it should brown evenly all over, and 
during the last quarter the steam should dry 
out. The last few minutes the heat may be 
decreased. If a properly-proportioned recipe 
and a good baking powder have been used, 
no particular care is necessary to avoid jar- 
ring the cake. 

Cake is done when it has shrunk away 
from the sides of the pan, when it springs 
back when touched with the finger and when 
it does not hiss, steam or crackle. The cake 
may be tested by a clean common steel hat- 
pin; if done, the point when inserted will 
come out perfectly clean. 

After removing from the oven the cake 
should be allowed to stand for a few minutes 
in the pan and then carefully loosened about 
the edges with a limber knife, then tipped 
out on a cake cooler. 

Good Cake 

Good cake is of fine texture, or even thick- 
ness; it should be level, light, tender and 
moist, but not sticky. It should not be 
crumbly, although it should break easily into 
pieces. The crust should be tender and of a 
uniform brown color. 

If the cake breaks open on the top, too 
much flour has been used or the cake has 
been carelessly put into the pan. Sogginess 
or heaviness is usually caused by too little 
flour, too much sugar, too much fat or under- 
cooking. A cake that "runs all over the pan" 
shows the presence of too much baking pow- 
der. 

Cake may be covered with either a cooked 
frosting or an uncooked icing. If the first, it 
should be put on the cake while the latter is 
still warm. 

If not to be iced, the cake may be sprinkled 
with a little cocoanut or some chopped nut- 
meats and a little granulated sugar before 
being put into the oven. 

Cake occupies a definite place in the meal 
and acts as a sweet and a starch; and in case 
of sponge cake, where a large number of 
eggs are used, or a cake rich in nut-meats. It 
is a protein, or muscle-maker.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

Introduce as much acid fruit as possible; 
rhubarb is coming in season and can be used 
either plain stewed, or baked with raisins or 
prunes. Grape juice, grapefruit and stewed, 
dried peaches or apricots will make considerable 
variety. The lighter cereals will be enjoyed, such 
as those that are ready prepared. The main 
dish should be light, few fried foods being used. 
Meat is too heavy at this season, eggs in various 
forins ; fish, and even vegetables being welcome ; 
creamed asparagus on toast, for instance, is an 
excellent breakfast dish. 

Luncheon or Supper 

On cool days, substantial stews or chowders 
will be enjoyed, as clam chowder; Lima bean 
chowder ; or corn chowder. As many of the green 
vegetables as possible should be introduced so, 
when days are warm, try various salads. The 



stereotyped dessert may be relieved by the intro- 
duction of waffles or griddle cakes, cooked on an 
unoiled griddle. 

Dinner 

The same rule applies to dinner foods, as to the 
other meals ; few fried dishes should be intro- 
duced. This is the time to serve broiled chops ; 
flank steak ; Hamburg steak ; and lamb cutlets — 
in other words, meats which are easy of digestion. 
Do not forget to make use of the turnip tops, the 
carrot tops and the beet tops, which accompany 
those vegetables. As to asparagus, be sure to save 
the butt ends to use as a basis in the making of 
soup. When making dessert, remember that the 
family will welcome foods that are tart, so have

Baked Rhubarb with Raisms 



G stalks rhubarb 
1 cup raisins 



1 cup sugar 
% cup water 



(^UT the rhubarb into pieces about one-and- 
^-^ oue-half inches long. Place in a baking dish 
with the raisins, sugar and water, cover closely 
and bake until tender — about half an hour — in a 
moderate ovcn^550° F. 

Old-fashioned Gingerbread 



1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
1^ teaspoons ground 
ginger 



% cup shortening 
1 cup boiling water 
1% cups molasses 
% cup brown sugar 
3 cups flour 

pLACE the shortening — which may be of any 
■•• kind — in a mixing bowl, pour the boiling 
water over it to melt it, and add the molasses and 
sugar. Sift and add the flour, salt, soda and 
ginger. Beat thoroughly, turn into a baking pan 
which has been lined with oiled paper and bake 
in a moderate oven — 350° F. — ^from thirty to 
forty minutes. 

A cake containing both molasses and sugar 
burns quite readily and the oiled paper is used 
to protect the surface of the cake and render it 
less liable to scorching. 

Strawberry Cornstarch Pudding 

1 cup strawberries 2 cups boiling water 

A scant half cup sugar 2 tablespoons lemon juice 

% cup cornstarch ^i teaspoon salt 

1 cup marshmallow creme 

/^RUSH the strawberries so that the juice flows 
^ freely. Stir into the sugar and cornstarch 
which have been previously blended together and 
pour this mixture into the boiling water, boil 
up thoroughly, and then cook in a double boiler 
for at least twenty minutes. Cool, add the 
lemon juice and salt and pour onto the marsh- 
mallow creme, beating while pouring. Mold in 
small cups which have been dipped into cold 
water, chill, and serve with additional straw- 
berries, if desired, slightly crushed and sugared. 



Cream of Asparagus Soup 



1 can or bunch of as- 
paragus 

V2 small onion 

3 cups boiling water 

2 tablespoons butter 

3 tablespoons flour 



1 pint hot milk 
% teaspoon salt 
A slight grating of nut- 
meg 
Va teaspoon paprika 



REMOVE the tips 
reserve these for 



from the asparagus and 
some other dish, such as 
Asparagus Tips on Toast, Asparagus Salad or 
Eggs with Asparagus Tips. Simmer the remain- 
der of the stalks with the onion in the boiling 
water until tender — about twenty minutes — then 
pass through a sieve, rubbing through it as much 
as possible of the pulp. Prepare a white sauce 
by blending the butter and flour and when these 
are smooth adding the milk and the seasonings. 
Combine the sifted asparagus and water with this 
sauce, bring to boiling point and add the nutmeg. 
If desired, a half cup of hot cream or evaporated 
milk may be added just before serving and will 
enrich the soup. Serve with croutons or crackers. 

Toasted Cheese Sandwiches 



Slices of bread 
Butter 



Thin slices of cheese 
Mustard 



CUT the bread at least one-quarter of an inch 
thick, butter half of the slices and spread the 
remainder with thin slices of cheese. Season the 
cheese with mustard, or if preferred, cream the 
butter and mustard together so that one spreading 
suffices. Press the slices of buttered bread firmly 
over the cheese and toast slowly, thus giving 
opportunity for the cheese to heat and slightly 
melt. Cut into strips and tuck between the folds 
of a napkin to keep hot. 

Salt Codfish with Shirred Eggs au Gratin 

1 cup salt codfish 
1^ cups White Sauce 
Vi teaspoon paprika 

FRESHEN the codfish slightly by soaking it 
in warm water — the length of time needed 
will vary according to the saltiness of the fish. 
Add it to the White Sauce and cook until the

Chocolate Bread Cvstard Pudding 



^^ teaspoon vanilla ex- 
tract 



Vi teaspoon salt 



6 thin slices buttered 

bread 
2 cups milk 
% cup sugar 
I square chocolate 

■DUTTER the bread, cut it into finger lengths, 
^ and lay these in an oiled baking dish. Melt 
the chocolate _ in the^ inner vessel of a double 
holler, add to it the milk, flavoring and sugar and 
bring to scalding point. Pour this mixture over 
the well-beaten eggs and when mixed turn it over 
the slices of bread. Bake in a moderate oven — 
350° F. — until the custard is set. Serve hot or 
cold. 

It is preferable to place the dish containing the 
pudding in a pan of hot water while baking so 
that the eggs may not separate through too rapid 
cooking. 

White Iiayer Cake 



% teaspoon salt 
2 teaspoons baking pow- 
der 
% cup milk 
"Whites of two eggs 



4 tablespoons butter 
or vegetable fat 

1 cup sugar 

1 teaspoon vanilla ex- 
tract 

1^ cups paltry flour 

CREAM the butter, add the sugar gradually, 
then the vanilla. Sift the flour, salt and 
baking powder and add these alternately with 
the milk. Last of all add the whites of eggs 
which have been beaten until stiff. Fold these in 
gently and bake the cake in two. layers in well 
oiled pans. Have the oven moderately hot— about 
325° to 350° F. Put together with cooked cream 
filling, and cover with orange or Coconut icing. 

Sliced Oranges 

SELECT a seedless orange for each person, 
pour boiling water over it, let stand for a 
minute, then peel immediately. _The boiling water 
loosens the white pith so that it will come away 
easily with the orange rind. Cut into the 



thinnest possible slices and arrange on a plate 
overlapping each other. If desired, a small heap 
of powdered sugar may be piled in the center of 
the plate. 



Orange Mint Cocktail 



3 juicy oranges 
1 tablespoon finely 
chopped mint 



3 tablespoons sugar 
6 maraschino cherries 
2 tablespoons cherry juice 



T^IVIDE the oranges into sections and remove 
^-^ all skin and pith. Add the sugar and mara- 
schino cherry juice and set aside to chill for one 
hour. Chop the mint finely, mix it with the 
oranges, pile high in small glasses and place 
a cherry on top of each. 



Individual Orange Shortcake 

PREPARE a dough as for Baking Powder Bis- 
■•■ cuits but use twice the amount of shortening. 
Roll or pat thinly, cut into rounds as for biscuits, 
brush the tops with melted shortening and lay 
two rounds on top of each other. Bake about 
fifteen minutes in a moderately hot oven — 360° 
to 875° F. 

Prepare the fruit by removing all skin, pith 
and seeds, break or cut the oranges into small 
pieces and allow them to stand well sugared for 
one hour that the juice may flow freely. Pile 
the oranges thickly between and on top of the 
shortcakes which have been split and buttered. 
Serve, with or without whipped cream. 

i' .Creaflig^ Young Onions on Toast 

3 bunches "you^: onions % teaspoon salt

"IXTASH the onions very thoroughly, cut off the 
' ' roots; and remove the tops sufliciently to 
leave the onions about five inches long. (The 
tops can go into the stock pot.) Tie together in 
bunches and boil until tender in slightly salted 
water. Meanwhile make a white sauce of the 
butter, fiour, milk and seasonings. Drain the 
onions thoroughly, lay them on slices of toast 
and pour the sauce over them.

Measurements 

Accuracy Essential to Good Cookery 



MEASURING spoons and cups are not to be 
chosen at random^ for should this be 
done, poor results will almost certainly 
follow. Obviously, if one size spoon and cup 
are used to measure the ingredients for the 
cake you make today, and another size used 
in making the same cake next week, the pro- 
portions will not be the same, nor are the re- 
sults likely to be uniform; so be careful to 
keep at least a standard pint and half-pint 
cup and a standard tablespoon and teaspoon 
in your kitchen ectuipment for use in measur- 
ing. 

Better still, in addition to the pint cup, have 
two of half-pint size, one of these being of 
glass so that the quantity of any ingredient it 
contains — liquid or solid — can easily be seen. 

Measuring cups, both of glass and metal, 
are clearly marked so as to show one-third, 
one-quarter, one-half and three-quarters, so 
there need be no guess work in measuring. 

Then there are sets of spoons made ex- 
pressly for measuring, fastened together at 
the top for safe keeping. These spoons hold 
respectively — ^one tablespoon, and one-quarter, 
one-half and one teaspoon. 

Level Measurements tlie Basis 

All standard recipes are based on the slo- 
gan — "All Measurements Are Level," and 
"level" means that after a cup or a spoon is 
filled with the required ingredient — flour for 
instance — the contents are leveled off with the 
straight edge of a knife resting upon both 
edges of the utensil, pushing off all of the 
extra flour and leaving the utensil level full. 
To measure a half spoon — fill the spoon level 
full, then divide the contents lengthwise of the 
spoon. Half of this crosswise will measure 
one-quarter, etc. Remember, too, that flour 
and all dry solid ingredients such as baking 
powder, soda and spices, should be sifted be- 
fore being measured because they "pack" In 
the containers in which they are kept, and un- 
less sifted v/e are liable to get more than we 
need and by so doing possibly spoil the dish 
being prepared. 

In measuring liquids, a "cupful" or a 
"spoonful" means that the spoon or cup is to 
be filled ito the brim, but not so full that it 
cannot be carried without spilling. 

The expression "butter the size of an egg" 
is often used .in a recipe. This means one 
heaping tablespoon or two ounces or one- 
quarter of a cup. 

Again, one is sometimes puzzled when read- 
ing a recipe — one tablespoon of melted butter 
— OP— -one tablespoon of butter, melted. The 



former wording indicates that the butter is to 
be melted first then measured, while a table- 
spoon of butter, melted, indicates that the 
cook is to measure her butter first and to melt 
it afterwards. 

Here is a table of weights and measures 
which will enable you to change a recipe in 
which the ingredients are given by weight into 
the right proportions, if you have only cups 
and spoons with which to measure, instead of 
scales:

to know the right proportions of one ingredi- 
ent to use in combination with another. Here 
are a few useful suggestions: 

1 measure of liquid to 3 cups of flour for mak- 
ing a dough as for bread. 

1 measure of liquid to 2 cups of flour for a 
drop batter, as for mufiins. 

1 scant measure of liquid to 1 full measure

About Gelatine 



VERT few housewives appreciate the great 
value of gelatine — and know the many 
ways in which it can be used. 

Gelatine may be used in innumerable ways, 
which include not only the familiar jelly, but 
in jellied soups; the various delicious jellied 
entrees; the dainty jellied salads, which are 
so easy to make, as well as the more dec- 
orative, delicious desserts. 

There is no food in cookery which can be 
more easily used than gelatine. Soluble 
though it is, when it comes in contact with 
the stomach, it belongs to the muscle-making 
group discussed in "The Balanced Ration." 

Gelatine is always used with some other 
food product. When a jellied soup is served, 
we add a dissolvent; when an entree is made, 
such as jellied salmon, meat loaf or egg and 
vegetable jelly, we add bulk, liquid and pro- 
tein; when a jellied fruit salad Is used, bulk, 
liquid and acid, as well as sweet, are added, 
and if the jellied salad is of vegetable nature, 
it strengthens the balance and the mineral of 
the meal. In the form of jellied chicken 
salad it may be Classified as a muscle-maker. 

The gelatine dessert may be made to bal- 
ance almost any lacking element of the meal. 
For a luncheon that is deficient in fat — a 
raspberry Bavarian Cream which contains 
whipped cream will fill the gap. Or, if the 
meal is deficient in muscle-making properties, 
then the addition of a coffee sponge which 
contains eggs will make it balance. 

As a gelatine dish cannot be stiffened in a 
minute, the time to make it is in the morning 
before the washing of the breakfast dishes 
if you wish to serve for dinner in the evening. 

Molding Gelatines 

Many women have asked me how they can 
duplicate the beautiful molds they have seen 
at gelatine booths in food shows. 

If the mold is very elaborate, use a little 
less liquid, say an eighth. The mold Itself 
should be rubbed with a little salad oil, then 
wiped out with tissue paper. The gelatine 
mixture may then be poured in and, after be- 
coming stiff, if loosened carefully about the 
edges, may be easily turned out. The gela- 
tine is placed upon a paper doily on the serv- 
ing platter, and It may then be moved about 
as desired. If fruit, vegetables or flowers are 
to be molded in the jelly, it is first necessary 
to pour in a thin film of the mixture. Set 
the mold in ice water, and when the film is 
barely congealed, place the beginning of the 
design upon it. Pour in a little more of the 
mixture until the desired result is gained. 



If fruit or vegetables are to be stirred into 
the gelatine, the prepared food should be 
stirred into the gelatine when it becomes 
slightly thickened like an egg white. It is 
then sufficiently firm so that the pieces of 
food will not be precipitated to the bottom. 

The molds for ordinary gelatine may be 
rubbed with a salad oil or rinsed with cold 
water, and, while wet, the gelatine should be 
poured in. 

Gelatine Desserts 

To make any plain fruit or coffee gelatine 
mixture into a "sponge," prepare a pint, 
using either your own recipe or making a 
pint of prepared gelatine. When it begins to 
congeal, but before it has begun to stiffen, 
set the vessel in ice water or cold water and 
beat it until fluffy, with an egg beater, and 
then beat into it one or two egg whites, 
whipped stiff. Turn into a mold and, when 
firm, serve with cream, top milk or sweet- 
ened, fresh fruit that will harmonize with it. 

Excellent combinations are coffee sponge 
and cream, grape juice sponge with sliced 
peaches, or oranges, lemon sponge with fresh, 
sugared berries, raspberry sponge with sug- 
ared raspberries, etc. 

A delicious result may be gained by pre- 
paring the gelatine as described in the pre- 
ceding paragraphs, but instead of adding the 
two stiffly-beaten egg whites, add a half 
cupful of any good marshmallow creme, 
barely softened with a little boiling water, 
then proceed as directed. 

Bavarian creams are really "second cou- 
sins" to those rich and delicious frozen des- 
serts, known as mousses. Strawberry, rasp- 
berry or peach Bavarian cream may be made 
as follows: 

Crush sufficient raspberries or strawberries, 
then sift them to make two cupfuls of fruit 
and juice, or use two cupfuls of sifted peach 
pulp. Add to one and a half tablespoonfuls 
of gelatine, cold water to barely cover; let 
stand five minutes, then dissolve it over 
steam, and add to the prepared fruit. Then 
stand it in cold water until it barely begins 
to congeal. Whip two cupfuls of heavy 
cream, beating in one and a half cupfuls of 
powdered sugar. Fold the cream into the 
gelatine mixture and fill a mould with it. 
after rinsing it with cold water. When stiff, 
unmould and serve, garnished with sugared 
fruit of the same kind as that used In the 
cream. This may replace ice cream at any 
function. If the peaches are not of a very 
distinct fiavor, a half tablespoonful of lemon 
juice should be added to the pulp.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

Remember that breakfast can make or mar the 
day. Now that the warm weather is coming on, 
try serving some orange juice a few minutes be- 
fore breakfast. It is cleansing, cooling and full of 
vitamines. The stewed rhubarb can be varied 
with prunes, dried apricots, peaches, or figs ; the 
oranges, with strawberries, or grapefruit. Corn- 
meal mush and any of the lighter, wbeaten cereals 
may be used instead of farina. Salt fish may be 
substituted for bacon. 

Luncheon or Supper 

As to this meal, whereas it must be substantial 
and balanced, it should be kept light. Any of the 
fish, egg and dainty meat salads are suitable, so 
are such dishes as escalloped asparagus with 
ezss ; potatoes and dried beef, creamed together ; 



potato and clam pie ; escalloped salmon or tuna 
fish. As to dessert, remember that in case a 
muscle-making food does not appear in plenty in 
the main part of the meal, this balance must be 
made up in the dessert. If there is no other way 
to do it, cocoa made with milk will turn the trick. 

Dinner 

Any roast meat may be used instead of roast 
beef. White potatoes, macaroni, or rice in any 
form may be used as the starch. Asparagus, 
onions, or young carrots may replace the spinach. 
The salads should always be light and should be 
served with French dressing — mayonnaise being 
the exception, rather than the rule. Be sure to 
serve enough strawberries and sufficient foods in 
season, for they have been put there by Nature 
with a specific reason — thej/ contain what the 
tody needs.

Parker House Rolls 



Parkerhouse Rolls 



1 teaspoon salt 
1 yeast cake 
About 6 cups flour 



1 pint milk 

2 tablespoons shortenine 

2 tablespoons au^ar ^ 

OCALD the milk, add the shortening, sugar and 
^ salt, then cool until lukewarm. Soften the 
yeast cake in one-third cup of lukewarm water, 
add this to the milk and with a spoon beat in 
half of the flour. This will make a soft, spongy 
mixture. Cover and set aside to rise. The batter 
must be kept in moderate temperature, not over 
seventy degrees and must be free from draughts. 
When very light and spongy, add enough flour to 
make a dough which can be kneaded easily — 
this will probably be about three cups. An abso- 
lutely exact quantity cannot be stated as flours 
vary somewhat. When the dough has risen to 
double its bulk, turn out onto a floured board, roll 
to one-third inch in thickness, cut into rounds 
with a large biscuit cutter, brush each over with 
melted butter and fold half of the roll over the 
other, pressing the edges well together. Place in 
an oiled pan about one and one-half inches apart, 
let the rolls rise until very light, brush the tops 
with melted butter and bake in a quick oven — 
360° to 375° F. — fifteen to twenty-five minutes, 
according to size. 

Evaporated Milk Mayonnaise 

4 tablespoons evaporated % teaspoon salt 

milk ■ 1 teaspoon sugar (op- 

% cup oil tional) 

3 tablespoons lemon juice 

MEASURE the evaporated milk into a bowl 
and add the oil to it slowly, as in the mak- 
ing of ordinary mayonnaise. Add the lemon juice 
alternately with the oil as soon as the mixture 
is very thick and beat in the salt, and sugar, if 
used. Serve with any fruit salad. 

Stuffed Egg Salad 



4 eggs 

1 tablespoon butter 
1 teaspoon minced pars- 
ley 
A few drops onion juice 
Vi teaspoon salt 



% teaspoon paprika 
2 tablespoons minced 
ham or other meat, or 
sardines or smoked 
herring 



TO HARD-COOK the eggs put them on in 
cold water, bring to boiling point and boil 
rapidly for ten minutes. Then chill in cold 
water, cut into halves with a sharp knife, remove 
the yolks and either mash these with a fork or 



% cup butter 
4 egg yolks 
H^ tablespoons lemon 
juice 



pass them through a sieve. Blend the meat and 
seasonings together, moistening if dry with a 
tablespoon of mayonnaise. Form the mixture 
into balls and pile high in the hollows from which 
the yolks of the eggs were taken. Arrange on 
crisp lettuce leaves or in a nest of watercress 
and garnish with lemon fans or strips of pimiento 
and serve with Mayonnaise or Boiled Salad 
Dressing. 

HoUandaise Sauce 

% teaspoon salt 
% teaspoon pepper (Cay- 
enne) 
% cup boiling water 

/^REAM the butter with a fork ; add the yolks 
^-' of eggs one by one, beating after each is 
added until like Mayonnaise. Then add the 
lemon juice, salt and cayenne. Put in a double 
boiler and add the water, and heat with a rotary 
egg beater until like a thick, boiled custard. 

Patti Bread 

/"'UT stale bread into the finest possible slices — 
^-' almost waferlike. Lay on a pan or rack in 
the oven and dry out rather than cook until the 
bread is golden brown. If to be kept from one 
meal to another, store in a tightly closed tin 
to preserve crispness. 

Potato Pancakes 



2 large potatoes 
1 egg 

Vs cup flour 

% teaspoon baking pow- 
der 



% teaspoon salt 
% teaspoon pepper 
1 teaspoon finely chopped 
parsley 



ORATE the potatoes coarsely ; add the flour, 
^-^ baking powder, seasoning and parsley, and 
lastly, the egg beaten light. Mix all thoroughly 
and drop by spoonfuls into a frying pan con- 
taining a little hot fat. Flatten slightly, brown 
on both sides and serve as desired. 

Baked Beef with Tomatoes 

3 cups minced cold beef 1 teaspoon sugar 

1 onion % teaspoon salt 
1% cups canned tomatoes % teaspoon pepper 

2 tablespoons flour l'/^ cups any flaked cereal

WOMAN'S WORLD C A L U N D A B COOK BOOK 

Monthly Message for June 

Vegetable Oils and Fats 



THE various cooking oils should be con- 
sidered under the head of butter substi- 
tutes, in so far as they are used instead 
of butter in cookery. These oils are extracted 
variously from peanuts, corn, cotton-seed, 
coconuts, and so on, and while they are, one 
might say, a comparatively recent discovery, 
the vegetable oil itself has been used for 
cookery, since time immemorial, in the form 
of olive oil. 

Probably the best known usage of the 
vegetable oil is for the making of salad 
dressings and salads. These oils lend them- 
selves particularly well to this phase of 
cookery, either singly, or in combination with 
one-third their quantity of rather highly- 
flavored olive oil. 

The method of using the vegetable oils in 
the making of salad dressing is the same as 
when olive oil is used. A good vegetable oil 
is so pure and so highly refined that it is 
practically tasteless, so, in case the salad 
dressing may seem a little "empty" in taste, 
add a bit more seasoning. It is much easier 
to make a mayonnaise with these other veg- 
etable oils than with olive oil as it is not 
nearly so liable to break down. In fact, 
vegetable oil may be used in the making of 
this dressing at room temperature, instead of 
icy cold. 

It is the greatest possible help in salad 
making to keep on hand a jar of French 
dressing, a jar of mayonnaise and a jar of 
cooked salad dressing. It takes no longer to 
make up these foods in quantities of a pint 
or a quart than in smaller amounts and dur- 
ing the Summer months, especially when the 
salad dressing is already made up, the put- 
ting together of a substantial salad for 
luncheon or supper is the work of but a few 
moments. 

Vegetable Oils for Cocking 

The war, with its necessity for fat con- 
servation, did a, great deal toward introduc- 
ing these fats into general cooking. But, 
here again, prejudice, in many cases, has 
halted the march of a really excellent cook- 
ing product. The woman who, for instance, 
is accustomed to "creaming her butter" for 
cake, often finds it difficult to merely add the 
liquid oil! Apparently, sho had rather spend 
the five minutes necessary for the creaming 
process than to get out of her rut! Again, 
many women say that they can "taste" the 
difference. Under certain conditions this may 
be possible, but if the vegetable oil IS T^'RED 
IN PROPER PROPORTIONS, ANT) IF STT- 
FiriENT SAT^T IS ADDED TO THE MIX- 
TURE ANT DIFFERENCE IN TASTE CAN- 



NOT BE DETECTED — EXCEPT IN THE 
IMAGINATION. 

When substituting a vegetable oil for but- 
ter in the ordinary recipe, use from a fourth 
to a fifth less. In making cakC: cream to- 
gether the oil and sugar according to the 
usual method, then add the salt, flavoring 
and egg yolks. In making pastry, sift to- 
gether the dry ingredients, stir in the oil and 
add the wetting, and proceed in the same 
way for baking powder biscuit mixtures. 

"Whenever a recipe calls for melted butter, 
add the proper proportion of the oil. The 
vegetable oils are also especially good for 
deep-fat frying, as they can be heated to a 
high temperature without smoking. Always 
test them with a cube of bread, never wait for 
smoking point. 

The tests are as follows: 

Croquettes and oysters — 40 counts, or sec- 
onds. 

Doughnuts, fritters and fish balls — 60 
counts, or seconds. 

French-fried white or sweet potatoes, or 
onions — 90 counts, or 1% minutes. 

Raw meat, or small fish — 120 counts, or 
2 minutes. 

Solidified vegetable fats are nothing more 
than vegetable oils in solidified form. Some- 
times they are used singly and sometimes in 
combination. When used in place of butter 
in cooking they may be termed a butter sub- 
stitute, and should be manipulated like but- 
ter. Extra salt must always be added and 
the general proportion is from a fourth to a 
fifth less than would be used of butter. They 
are not generally adapted to the seasoning of 
vegetables, although they may be used for 
this purpose, and are not so malleable, in the 
making of salads, as the liquid oils. In using 
them as a frying medium the same directions 
must be observed as with the liquid oils. 

Peanut butter is considered primarily a 
butter substitute, as a spread only. It con- 
tains twenty-five per cent of protein and only 
approximately forty-six per cent of fat, the 
balance being made up in carbohydrates and 
minerals. It is therefore more than a mere 
butter substitute; it is a general food and. 
when used as a spread, may replace part of 
the other food elements in. the meal. It is 
also excellent as a butter substitute in cook- 
ing, but when it is used a small proportion of 
other fat should accompany it, in order to 
make the batter sufficiently short. It cannot 
be indiscriminately used in any reclne rallinfr 
f"r butter, because of its pronounced flavor, 
but its food value should be kept in mind 
when planning the meal.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

This is the month when the adjustment of the 
body from Spring to warm weather is quite com- 
plete. Nature calls out for light, cleansing foods, 
but this does not mean that substantial dishes of 
meat should be entirely omitted, neither does it 
mean that when the hot days come on, quantities 
of ice-cold liquid and cold foods should be eaten ; 
in fact, if this is done, the body is so chilled that 
the perspiration is checked and, therefore, one 
feels still hotter. 

Try having as great a variety of fruits as pos- , 
sible ; use plenty of milk with the cereal and, if 
possible, cut down on some of the more substantial 
courses. . Try introducing a little lettuce, or a few 
radishes for a change, and on a Sunday morning, 
serve a great, big, delicious strawberry shortcake 
— and plenty of it ! 

Luncheon or Supper 

Do not forget that on cool days soups will still 
be enjoyed. A salad should form the main por- 
tion of the meal at least three times a week. 
Children should be given the plain lettuce with a 
French dressing over it — made with salad oil 
and lemon juice, instead of vinegar — or they can 
eat the lettuce plain. When the grown folks have 
a substantial salad, the youngsters should have a 
good barley broth, some scraped meat, eggs, or 



something suited to their age. On a very hot day, 
serve iced tea — not with the ice in it, but chilled 
next to the ice. For a change, try an eggnog as 
the main dish, varied by a fruit salad and deli- 
cious cheese or nut sandwiches. The vegetable 
shortcakes are always good, but when they are 
served, remember to be sure to put in an egg or 
milk dessert to keep up the muscle-making bal- 
ance. 

Dinner 

Any pot roast, such as beef or lamb, may be 
substituted for the veal. The vegetables may bo 
cooked with it — ^all in the same pot. If raspberry 
sherbet is too much trouble, try a raspberry gela- 
tine or Bavarian cream. Instead of ham baked 
in milk, substitute trout — if you are lucky enough 
to have them — or mackerel. Any broiled meat 
can be used instead of a broiled steak for Wednes- 
day ; a veal fricassee would be delicious for 
Thursday ; and salmon loaf would be good for 
Friday. Any seasonable vegetables may be sub- 
stituted, provided they are similar in food value. 
As to desserts, put in just as many fruits as you 
can. Any cake may be used instead of the coco- 
nut cake for Monday ; floating prune whip would 
be good for Tuesday ; strawberry shortcake for 
Wednesday; uncooked fruit pies for Thursday; 
jellied rhubarb for Friday ; and a good fruit 
shortcake for Saturday. Jyst let your imagina- 
tion run riot !

as high as possible to form nests. Place on each 
a poached egg, having made a little hollow to 
contain it. Pour the Cream Sauce round the 
nests and garnish with asparagus. 

Tomato Sauce may be used in place of the 
Cream Sauce. 

String beans, wax beans or spinach may be 
substituted for the asparagus.

Fruit Salad Jellied, Individual Service 



Fudge Brownies 



1 cup SUglwF 

5 tablespoons butter or 

vegetable fat 
A scant % cup milk 
% cup pastry flour 



1 cup chopped nut-meats 
■ — any kind 

2 eggs 

4 tablespoons cocoa 
% teaspoon salt 



1 teaspoon vanalla extract 

IJEAT the butter and sugar until light and 
creamy, add the eggs lightly beaten, next the 
milk, then the flour, salt and cocoa sifted together. 
Lastly, stir in the nuts and flavoring. Spread 
one-quarter of an inch thick on a shallow pan 
and bake fifteen minutes in a moderate oven — 
350° F. While still warm, cut into squares like 
fudge. 

Bran Bread 



1' yeast cake 

Z^A cups lukewarm water 
5 tablespoons molasses 
2 teaspoons salt 



^^ teaspoon baking soda 
4 cups bran 
About 5 cups ■whole 
wheat flour 



r^ISSOLVE the yeast in a half cup of the 
■^ water and when soft add it to the remain- 
ing three cups of water into which the molasses, 
soda and salt have been stirred. Beat into this 
mixture enough of the flour and bran mixed, to 
make a thick batter. Let this rise until light 
and spongy and then add the remainder of the 
bran and sufScient additional quantity of flour 
to make a dough stiff enough to be easily handled. 
Knead thoroughly and set aside to rise until it has 
doubled its bulk. Divide into loaves, again knead 
slightly, place in oiled pans, filling these about 
half full and let rise until the dough has again 
doubled its bulk. Bake from fifty minutes to an 
hour in a slow oven — 340° to 350° F. 

Bran bread may be made either with com- 
pressed or dry yeast, but in the event of dry yeast 
being used, it is well to make the dough up over 
night to allow ample time for it to rise. 

Buttered Beets with Lemon Juice 



Beets 

Melted Butter 



Lemon juics 
Salt and pepper 



WASH the beets thoroughly, but be careful nof 
to bruise the skins. Leave about three 
inches of stalks on the beets that they may not 
"bleed," and boil until tender. (New beets will 
cook in one hour; old beets may take four 
hours.) When tender, plunge into cold water, 




rub off the skins, cut into crosswise slices and 
add the salt and pepper to season, using three 
tablespoons of melted butter and one-half table- 
spoon of lemon juice to each three cups of beets. 
Let the beets and seasonings stand together for 
a few minutes and make them thoroughly hot 
before serving. 

Mixed Fruit Salad Jellied

1 large orange % cup lemon juice 

1 cup strawberries 1 cup boiling water 

1 cup any other fresh fruit ^^ cup cold water 
in season or other fruit Lettuce 

if preferred Mayonnaise 

2 tablespoons gelatine 

OOFTEN the gelatine in the cold water, pour 
"^ the boiling water over it and when the gela- 
tine is entirely dissolved, add the lemon juice and 
sugar and set aside to cool. Meanwhile oil indi- 
vidual molds and arrange the cut and smaU 
fruit in them, using enough to about half fill the 
molds. When the gelatine is cold but not set fill 
the molds with it, chill and unmold on the slices 
of pineapple and garnish with the lettuce and 
mayonnaise. 

Pot Roast of Veal 

5 pounds shoulder of veal 1 teaspoon mixed whole 



6 onions 

6 carrots 

4 tablespoons drippings 

3 cups water 



spices 
2 teaspoons salt 
% teaspoon pepper 
2 tablespoons flour 



tJAVE the bone removed from the veal and if 
■•■ ■•■ desired, replace it with stuffing, then roll and 
tie in compact shape — the butcher is usually 
willing to do this. Peei the onions, scrape the 
carrots , and wi^e tke . meat with a damp cloth. 
Melt the drippings in a large cooking kettle, 
brown the meat in them, then remove the meat 
and brown the flour in the-same drippings. Adc! 
the water, stir until boiling, then return the meat 
to the pan. Add the spices, tied in a small piece 
of cheesecloth, and simmer for an hour, after 
which add the seasonings and vegetables. Con- 
tinue the cooking until these are tender, then 
serve with the meat in the center of the platter 
and the vegetables atbtind it. 

Plain boiled rice or noodles are a good accom- 
paniment to a Pot Roast of Veal. 

If desired, one cup of canned tomato may be 
substituted for one cup of the water.

Milk — Condensed, Evaporated and Powdered 



SOME folks have the idea that milk is just 
for children; that because it is a liquid 
easily assimilated and lacking in bulk it 
belongs merely to the infants of the house- 
hold. To be sure, it is the paramount food 
for them, but just as it nourishes and helps 
them to grow, it nourishes and sustains the 
adult. 

Just to drink a glass of milk in addition to 
an otherwise scanty meal will not mean satis- 
faction to a hungry man, but it will when 
served in some other way, as in a substantial 
cereal and raisin pudding, an escallop of veg- 
etables with a generous allotment of cheese, 
or in a corn or bean chowder. 

Milk is a protein, or muscle-making food. 
In itself it is less expensive than meat, eggs, 
or nuts, and on a par with fish. When used , 
as a protein in the diet in connection with 
inexpensive fillings, such as rice, hominy, 
vegetables from the garden, dried vegetables 
or odds and ends of left-overs, its use be- u 
comes a real economy. 

During the last few years we have not only 
learned what milk is, its mission in the body ,', 
and of the wonderful vitamines, or life-giving ' 
elements, which it contains, but we have also 
learned how it can be jnarlieted in tins, as 
well as in dried or powdered form. 

Evaporated Milk — ^Its Preparation 

and Uses 

Many housewives do not understand. about 
these various kinds of milk. Evaporated milk 
is unsweetened — just pure, fresh milk from 
which half the water has been evaporated. It 
is then placed in small and large cans, sealed 
and sterilized so that it will keep. It will 
keep for some hours after opening, without 
ice. To bring it up to the food value of ordi- 
nary, milk, add an equal quantity of water. 
If a good grade of evaporated milk is selected 
there will be no scalded, pronounced taste 
when the milk is used undiluted instead of 
cream in coffee. 

Evaporated milk may replace cream in 
cooking, but it must be clearly understood 
that it does not have the food value of cream, 
vchich is nearly all fat, though it will replace 
cream in many instances, as far as consist- 
ency and general effect is concerned. Certain 
kinds of evaporated milk, when sweetened 
and flavored, may be ' Used like whipped 
cream. 



Condensed Milk — When and 
How to Use It 

Condensed milk is a very different product, 
for it contains sugar, weight for weight. It 
can only be used in cases where sweetening 
and milk combined are to be introduced, as in 
making custard fillings, milk desserts and ice 
cream. Two tablespoons of condensed milk . 
are dissolved in a scant cup of water to pro- 
duce milk containing butter fat equivalent to 
that of fresh milk and at the same time sugar 
in the same proportion as when the actual 
product is used. 

Powdered Milk 

Then we- have dried milk in two forms — 
dried skimijied milk and whole milk. While 
left in dried form it requires no refrigera- 
tion. 

Many housewives do not understand what 
dried milk is. It is merely fresh milk from 
which the water has been entirely removed, 
leaving the solids, which are sold in powd- 
ered or crystalline form. When the powdered 
milk is skimmed before it is prepared for 
market, it contains all the food value of fresh 
milk except the butter fat. But when whole 
milk is powdered, the butter fat is retained. 
Roughly, one-quarter cup, or four table- 
spoons, of powdered milk dissolved in a cup 
of cold or warm water equals fresh whole or 
skimmed milk in food value, according to the 
kind that has been prepared. It can then be 
used just as fresh milk in any way desired. 

"But what of the vitamines?" you ask. "Is 
it safe to give my family evaporated, con- 
densed or powdered milk?" 

The subject of vitamines is still In an em- 
bryonic state, but well-known authorities 
such as Doctors Mendel, Osborn and McCol- 
lum have stated that the heating of milk 
does not interfere with its life-giving and 
growth-promoting properties. 

So why skimp milk for brother's cereal? 
Why put too much water in father's soup' 
Why make the rice pudding with half water? 
This is not economy. This is an absolute 
undermming of the most precious of all pos- 
sessions — the family health. 

Cut the excess sugar. We all eat too much 
of It. Regulate the number of starches, as 
nearly all of us suffer from autointoxication. 
Cut down meat to once a day and introduce 
some of those delicious casseroles and made 
dishes from thp cheaper cuts, so that you 
may incfeuse the milk.

Canning Suggestions 



WHEN there Is an over-abundance of 
fruits, vegetables, and sometimes of 
meat, It is absolutely necessary that 
they be conserved by home canning. This 
process may be made simple or difficult, ac- 
cording to whether the day chosen to accom- 
plish it is sufficiently free of other duties 
and to the way in which the work is carried 
on. 

Again there are times when a considerable 
quantity of different foods may be prepared 
at one time, as baked beans, or thick pea 
soup, then canned ready for use later on. 

The principles underlying successful can- 
ning are absolute cleanliness, foods of good 
quality and sufficient sterilization to kill all 
germ life. 

The simplest outfit used for canning is a 
stout wash-boiler, a wire rack to fit into it 
to hold the jars — good jars, new rubbers, a 
big colander for blanching and dipping and a 
steamer top to use in steaming bulky vege- 
tables before jarring them. However, if 
much canning is to be done, it will pay to 
purchase a pressure cooker, as the right use 
of this utensil will save time, fuel and 
energy. General instructions accompany the 
cooker. 

The canning tables give time directions for 
the cooking process; with both wash-boiler 
outfit and pressure cooker, the preliminary 
work is as follows: 

1. Wash the fruit or vegetable in cold 
water. 

2. Blanch — that is, scald in boiling water, 
from five to ten niinutes, or steam from fif- 
teen to twenty minutes. 

3. Plunge into cold water for two min- 
utes. 

4. Peel or skin — as needed. For ex- 
ample, one peels carrots or tomatoes — straw- 
berries and plums do not need it.

5. Remove seeds, stemd and blossom ends 
according to common sense. 

6. Pack as much as possible into abso- 
lutely clean scalded jars. 

7. Cover with cold water containing a tea- 
spoonful of salt to the quart for vegetables — 
sugar syrup or plain water for fruit. 

8. Place a new rubber on each jar, and 
partly close down the covers. 

9. Place the cans in the boiler, cover 
with cold water until the jars are submerged 
at least two inches. 

10. Put on the boiler lid, bring to boiling 
point, and boil steadily the length of time 
allowed in the canning table. 

11. Then remove, close permanently with- 
out opening, no matter how much the mate- 
rial in the can may have shrunk. If more 
convenient, cool in the water. 

12. Turn upside down on a cloth and cool, 
away from draughts. If the jars leak, new 
rubbers will have to be put on and the 
process repeated. 

13. Store in a dark place, moderately 
cool. 

The syrups used to cover fruits are made 
by boiling granulated sugar and water to- 
gether for five minutes. A syrup of medium 
sweetness or heaviness is used for canning 
juicy fruits, a thin moderately sweet syrup 
being reserved for rather dry fruits needing 
long cooking. A pound of sugar to one and 
one half quarts of water is correct for juicy 
fruits, one and one-fourth pounds of sugar 
to three auarts of water may be used for 
firmer fruits.

The Most Inexperienced Housewife Can Make 
Perfect Jelly by the New Amazing Certo Process 

It Never Fails — Quick and Economical 



By Ann Proctor 



Certo has revolutionized jelly and jam making. 
It has taken away the uncertainty as to "jelly- 
ing" and made it as accurate a process as two and 
two make four. It has extended the season of 
jelly-making to cover every month of the year. 
Moreover, with Certo you can have as many kinds 
of jam and jelly as there are species of fruit. With 
Certo all fruit juices "jell." 

And Certo is a pure fruit product — nothing c}se. 
It contains no preservative or gelatine. It 13 
Mother Nature's jell-maker, the concentrated form 
of that element found in varying and uncertain 
quantities in fruit juices which make them "jell." 
In following the Certo recipes you measure out 
your Certo as you measure your sugar and fruit — 
the most inexperienced housewife can't go wrong. 

Before Certo jelly-making was difTicult, labori- 
ous, uncertain. No recipe would provide for every 
condition. An over-dry or wet season would affect 
the jellying properties of the fruit. Currants picked 
late wouldn't "jell." Grapes must be taken before 
fully ripened. Some fruits, such as strawberries, 
cherries, raspberries, would hardly "jell" at all. 

Certo not only makes the process sure, but re- 
duces time and expense and results in jams and 
jellies of better flavor and color. By the Certo 
Process the boiling lime is cut down to one minute 
instead of boiling away flavor and fruit juice for a 
period of twenty minutes or much longer. This is 
an economy: the short boiling period gives more 
jam or jelly from the same amount of fruit and 
preserves all color and ripe fruit flavor. Nothing 
is lost. 

By the Certo Process you can make delicious 
jelly of bottled fruit juices — a few glasses at a time 
as you need it. You can make jelly 
and jams of all canned fruits and of 
dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, 
apricots and peaches. And you can 
easily put up marmalade from the 
winter grapefruit and oranges at far 
less cost than buying these dainties. 



You can understand, therefore, why 
Certo is so highly recommended by 
cookery editors and teachers as well 
as by expert housewives that have 
tried it. 




Grape Jelly 

Now Easily Made Anytime 

Measure 7 Vi leveled cups {3 M lbs.) of sugar and 4 cups 
of bottled grape juice into large saucepan, stir, and bring to 
boil. At once add one bottle of CERTO (scant cup) stir- 
ring continually, and bring again to hard boil for one 
minute. Stir constantly. Remove from fire, skim and pour 
into sterilized glasses. Makes 11 half-pound glasses. 

Strawberry Jam 
Crush well, in single layers about 2 quarts of ripe 
berries with wooden masher. Measure 4 level cups (2 
lbs.) of crushed berries with 7 H leveled cups (3 H lbs.) of 
sugar into preserving kettle, mix well, stir constantly and 
bring to hard boil over hottest fire. Boil bard one min- 
ute, continually stirring. Take from fire and add one- 
half bottle of Certo (scant M cup) stirring it in well. 
From time jam is taken off fire let stand five minutes only, 
by the clock, before pouring into glasses. In meantime 
skim, stir a little to cool slightly, then pour quickly. 

Pineapple Jam 

To give your family or guests a surprise, you need: 
— 1 large can Pineapple, 7 M level cups (3 Ji lbs.) of sugar 
and 1 bottle of CERTO. Use grated pineapple or put sliced 
pineapple through the food chopper. Mix the juice and 
chopped pineapple and measure out tour cups into a large 
saucepan. If necessary, add water to fill the fourth cup. 
Add sugar, mix and bring to a vigorous boil, stirring con- 
stantly. Boil hard one minute. Remove from fire, and 
add Certo stirring well. Skim and pour into glasses. 
Makes 1 1 half-pound glasses. 

Orange Jelly 

Use 12 oranges. Grate off the yellow part of the rinds 
into a dish. Cut fruit into halves and squeeze out the 
juice. Mix the juice with the grated rind and squeeze 
the mixture through a strong fine cloth to remove rind 
and pulp. Measure 3 cups of juice (1 ¥• lbs.) and 7 level 
cups (3 lbs.) of sugar into a large saucepan, stir and bring 
to boil. At once add Certo. stirring constantly. Con- 
tinue to stir and bring to a hard boil for one-half minute, 
stirring constantly. Remove from fire, skim and pour 
quickly into glasses. 

The above recipes and nearly 100 others are 
found in the Certo Book of Recipes. This will tell 
you how to make a year-round variety of jams, 
jellies and marmalades. 

Your grocer carries CERTO, or can order it for 
you. Or, you can get a bottle by parcel post pre- 
paid for 35 cents. Please send with order your 
grocer's name and address so that hereafter you can 
obtain Certo promptly. Get a bottle of Certo 
right away and see how easy it is to surprise your 
family with toothsome dainties made with little 
expenditure of time and money.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 

Breakfast piazza or in the backyard. A picnic means, first 

of all, a good time ; incidentally, "eats," but if 
you will learn to i)ut a loaf of substantial home- 
made bread in a basket or on a tray, together 
with a bread knife and board, and some cream 
cheese, plain butter or peanut butter, plenty of 
milk to drink, some bland fruit — not too acid — 
and some cookies or cake then betake yourself 
and the children out into the open, to eat the self- 
same luncheon from paper dishes, you will find 
that it is no bother at all, but a great refresh- 
ment. Try some of these picnic luncheons for 
this month. 



Bread is one of pur best foods and we should 
eat more of it during the Summer months than 
at any other time. Because of the body's call for 
something light, our bread should be made as 
nourishing as possible. Now is the time to intro- 
duce plenty of entire wheat bread — yes, made with 
one hundred, per cent entire wheat. It is sheer 
nourishment — vitamines, and all. Then there is 
old-fashioned cornmeal — the kind that is ground 
at the mill. Try introducing some corn bread — 
plenty of it — made with sour milk or buttermilk ; 
or use spoon bread made with cornmeal. Lighten 
Up the heavy main dishes and see how the family 
responds. Try serving -hot muffins containing 
left-over cereal, such as cooked brown rice ; or 
raised oatmeal, muffins, for a change ; French 
toast ; plain milk toast ; toasted Boston brown 
bread with hot milk poured over it ; raisin coffee 
cake^all of them offer a wide selection. And if 
you serve a cereal with plenty of milk, so that 
everybody will have at least a glassful, you will 
find that the family menu will balance with 
minimum labor on your part. 

Luncheon or Supper 

It is oftentimes possible to make luncheon or 
supper a picnic meal, even if it's only on the 



Dinner 

In planning the menus for this month I have 
kept the dinners substantial. You will notice that 
they contain a preponderance of vegetables ; in 
fact, there is no reason why entire vegetable meals 
cannot be introduced, providing you prepare a 
suitable muscle-making food to keep up the family 
nourishment, such as plenty of good homemade 
ice cream ; baked custard made with milk and 
eggs ; iced cocoa made with milk ; milk or egg 
shake. It is a safe rule to follow, to have two 
meatless dinners a week. For suggestions as to 
how you can introduce the muscle-making ele- 
ments see "Your Meals and Good Health," then 
let your imagination do the rest.

Cheese Straws 

Scraps of left-over pie Grated cheese 

crust _ Salt and paprika 

D OLL the pastry out thinly, sprinkle half of it 
thickly with the grated cheese, salt and pa- 
prika. Fold the other half of the pastry over 
this and roll out again thinly. Cut into long 
strips and twist together as shown in the illus- 
tration. Lay on a baking sheet, brush over the 
tops with milk to glaze them and bake ten min- 
utes in a moderately hot oven — 350° to 375° F. 

Salad Dressed at the Table 

THEN salad is to be dressed at the table, be 
sure that the lettuce has been thoroughly 
washed, drained and placed in a bag in the re- 
frigerator to crisp for two or three hours before 
serving. Also be sure that the salad bowl in 
which it is placed is large enough to permit 
proper mixing and blending of the salad with the 
dressing. 

For the dressing allow one tablespoon of oil, 
one-third tablespoon of vinegar, one-quarter tea- 
spoon of salt and one-eighth teaspoon of pepper 
for each two persons to be served. 

To dress the salad, measure the oil, pour it 
over the salad and add the salt and pepper. Then 
toss the salad about with the fork and spoon until 
the leaves begin to look a little wilted, after which 
add the vinegar and continue the mixing. 

Mint, tarragon or other vinegars may be used 
to give variety of flavor, while minced celery, 
thinly shaved onion, or finely chopped green pep- 
pers, etc., may be strewed among the salad greens 
to give further variety. 

Radish Roses 

CELECT perfectly shaped radishes. Wash them 
y thoroughly, then with a sharp knife make five 
incisions through the skin, running from root to 
crown. Insert the point of a small knife in 



these and cut down to form petals, making the 
cuts extend about three-quarters of the length of 
the radish. Place in a bowl of ice water for at 
least two hours, when the sections of skin will 
open leaving a white center with pink leaves 
surrounding it. Leave one or two of the smallest 
leaves on the radishes as foliage for your "rose." 

Iced Coffee with Orange 

The rind and juice of 1 quart coffee 

two oranges % cup light cream, 

1 cup water Whipped cream, optional 

Vj cup sugar 

pEEL the rind of the orange thinly, cook it for 
■*• ten minutes in the water, add the sugar and 
allow it to dissolve. When cold mix with the 
coffee, chill thoroughly and at serving time add 
half a cup of light cream and orange juice. Re- 
move the orange rind before servir.;; and put a 
spoon of whipped cream on top of each glass or 
eup. 

Grape Juice and Orange Mint Julep 



6 or 8 mint leaves 
2 cups grape juice 
2 tablespoons sugar 



2 cups water 

y2 cup orange juice 

Crushed ice 



■pRIIISE the mint leaves, pour the grape juice 
■^ over them and allow the two to steep together 
for at least half an hour. Boil together the sugar 
and one cup of the water, add this with the orange 
juice and the remaining cup of water to the grape 
juice mixture and pour into glasses which have 
been half filled with crushed ice. Put a sprig of 
fresh mint in each glass and serve. 

Jfut Mayonnaise 

1 cup mayonnaise dress- % cup toasted, nut- 
ing meats, chopped 

coarsely 

^OMBINE ingredients and use as desired. This 
^-' dressing will keep at least a week. Any kind 
of nut-meats may be used.

can be filled with fruit as needed. 

A Vegetable Meal 

'T'HE illustration shows a one plate meal includ- 
■•• ing Baked Stuffed Tomatoes, Creamed As- 
paragus, String Beans, Peas, Buttered Carrots 
and Duehesse I'otatoes. 

Some of these Vegetables may be left-overs, for 
it is often possible to cook on one day a sufiieient 
quantity of vegetables to serve for more than one 
meal. The potatoes may be just plainly mashed, 
but if prepared as shown they make a very at- 
tractive garnish and serve as boundaries or divi- 
sions for the different vegetables. 

For six persons two cups of peas, the tips of 
one bunch of asparagus, half a dozen young car- 
rots, two cups of string beans, six tomatoes and 
three cups of mashed potato will be needed. 

Duehesse Potato — To prepare the Duehesse 
Potatoes have the required quantity of potato 
thoroughly mashed and free from lumps, season 
with salt, pepper, butter and a little hot milk. 
The yolk of an egg may be added as it helps to 
brown the potato more prettily, but its use is 
optional. Place the hot mashed and seasoned 
potatoes in a pastry bag which has been fitted with 
a star tube. Press the potato out to form a 
border and divisions or nests for the vegetables. 
Bake in a moderate oven just until the tips of 
the potatoes are tinged golden brown. Potatoes 
prepared in this way can be used as a garnish for 
steak, baked fish, minced meat or indeed in almost 
any service which calls for mashed potatoes.

Preserving, Jam and Jelly Making 



Preserves 

TO PREPARE preserved peaches, pears, 
apricots, plums, strawberries, raspberries, 
etc., follow the general directions for 
canning those fruits, with this exception — use 
a heavy syrup made of the following propor- 
tions of sugar and water — two and a half 
pounds of granulated sugar to three quarts 
of water — boiled together for five minutes. 

Various blends of flavoring may be used 
in preserving, as a little stick cinnamon or a 
few whole cloves in the syrup for citron, ap- 
ples, pears, peaches, currants, or fresh figs; 
lemon or orange rind with that for apples, 
pineapples, prunes, figs or blackberries, etc. 
Sometimes in preserving, it is possible to 
blend fruit flavors by using a contrasting 
fruit juice instead of water in making the 
syrup, as currant juice for raspberry pre- 
serve, rhubarb juice for pineapple preserve, 
etc. 

Jams and Conserves 

Jams are made of fruit pulp with the addi- 
tion of only a little, if any, water, and then 
only in case flrm fruits like apples are being 
used. The right amount of granulated sugar 
to use in jam making is three-fourths of a 
pound to a pound of fruit weighed after the 
fruit is prepared, or a half pound of gran- 
ulated sugar and a fourth pound of white 
corn syrup may be substituted. 

The sugar, and water, if used, should be 
added to the prepared fruit, the whole cov- 
ered and allowed to stand in a cool place 
for several hours to extract the juices. The 
mixture should then be gradually brought 
to boiling point and gently boiled, uncovered, 
until a, little, dropped on a cold plate, will 
stiffen. The mixture should be poured boil- 
ing Hot into clean glasses which have been 
boiled, and when cold and stiff covered with 
melted paraflin a:nd preferably with tin 
covers! 

Plain fruits, cooked in this way are called 
jams^conserves usually containing a blend 
of two or more fruits,' and often nuts. It is 
often possible, by making such a combina- 
tion, to extend a costly fruit, with one less 
expensive, as in .the Apple Orange Marma- 
lade given elseivhere in this book. 
Jellies 

Jelly making is wrongly considered a diffi- 
cult department of cookery. In reality there 
are only two or three principles underlying 
its success. First, good fruit free from all 
decay, and not at all overripe. Second, good 
judgment. 

Whatever the fruit the general process of 
making it into jelly is as follows: 



1. Wash fruit in cold water, but do not 
remove cores, seeds or skins. 

2. If small fruit, like currants, crush in 
preserving kettle and add no water. 

3. If large, like apples, cut in small pieces 
and add a CLuart of water to each quart of 
prepared fruit. 

4. Cook gently until fruit is soft and the 
juice running freely. 

5. Drain through a flannelette jelly bag, 
allowing at least two hours for the juice to 
drip through. . If the bag is squeezed, the 
jelly will be cloudy and therefore less attrac- 
tive in. appearance. The residue in the jelly 
bag can always be used for the making of 
fruit butter. 

6. Measure the juice by means of a 
standard pint or half pint cup. 

7. Bring to boiling-point, and boll rapidly 
for twenty minutes, counting the time from 
the commencement of the boiling. 

8. Add to this juice three-fourths the 
amount of granulated sugar measured by the 
same cup used for the juice. The sugar 
should be measured as soon as the juice is 
put on to boil, and be placed in a very slow 
oven, with the door open, to warm through.. 

9. Then bring to boiling-point again, and 
boil briskly for five minutes counting the 
time from when the mixture begins to boil. 
Remove any scum that may appear. 

10. Lift up the spoon, and hold it side- 
wise in the air — if jellying point is reached, 
two rows of drops will form on the end of 
the spoon. 

11. Pour into glasses that have been thor- 
oughly washed, then boiled. 

12. Set aside to cool, away from draughts, 
and at the end of 24 hours, coyer with melt- 
ed paraffin. 

Certain fruits are better suited to jelly- 
making than others because they contain a 
larger proportion of pectin — the vegetable 
starch that causes the cooked fruit juice to 
stiffen or solidify. These fruits are: Apples, 
grapes, red currants, gooseberri^, blueber- 
ries, blackberries, cranberries, crab apples, 
green apples, plums, quinces, raspberries and 
barberries. 

In making jelly from apricots, cherries, 
black currants, peaches, pineapple, pears, 
rhubarb, and strawberries, it is necessary to 
add pectin — either by combining them with 
some fruit rich in this constituent, as oranges 
or apples, or by the addition of liquid pectin 
which may be purchased. No matter what 
fruit is used, care should be taken to select 
that which is very flrm, sound, and if possible, 
a little underripe.

WOMAN'S WORLD CALENDAR COOK BOOK 

Monthly Message for August 

Beverages 



OUR three favorite beverages — tea, coffee 
and cocoa — form an excellent basis for 
iced drinks. To make good tea use a 
china pot; a teaspoon of tea for each indi- 
vidual and a cup of freshly-boiling water for 
each person should be poured upon the 
leaves, which should stand for three minutes. 
Then it should be poured from the leaves. 

For icing or chilling, use more for each 
person. To be at its very best, it should be 
poured boiling onto freshly-cracked ice and 
served with powdered sugar, sliced lemon 
and a sprig of mint. If prepared ahead of 
time, it should be chilled next to the ice, in a 
tightly-corked bottle. Iced tea is delicious 
with a tablespoon of lemon sherbet to each 
serving. 

Essentials of Good Coffee 

Coffee is our favorite national drink. First, 
the utensils must be clean. The pot must be 
thoroughly scrubbed after using, with soap 
and hot water, then rinsed and scalded to 
remove any trace of oily film. If a perco- 
lator is used, the tube should be cleansed 
with a brush; and if a cloth bag or filter is 
used, it should be cleansed in hot water, 
rinsed and dried in the sun. 

Second, boiling water must be used to re- 
tain the true coffee fiavor — the delicate, aro- 
matic oils, on which flavor depends, cannot 
be retained if cold water is used. 

Third, a full tablespoon of coffee roasted to 
just the right brown must be allowed for each 
person. 

It should be ground like coarse cornmeal. 
The coffee itself should be of good quality 
and free from chicory. 

How to Blake It 

There are three methods of making. The 
best is by filtration, because less caffeine is 
extracted from the coffee. The next best is 
used by coffee tasters; a full tablespoon of 
coffee for each person is measured into a 
heated pot, the freshly-boiling water (a 
cup for each person ) is poured into it — the 
whole is closely covered and allowed to stand 
in a warm place for ten minutes. The third 
method calls for the use of the percolator. 

Serve the coffee clear for best results; 
with a little sugar if desired. A little cream 
may be added or undiluted evaporated milk 
or whole milk heated to the temperature of 
the coffee, to bring up the food value. 

Cocoa has a place in the menu as a bev- 
erage and as a food, for it contains consider- 
able fat, a little starch, and invariably, some 
sugar; and when taken as plain beverage it 



should be made with at least half milk. The 
cocoa and water themselves should be thor- 
oughly boiled together, in order to cook the 
cocoa; as per directions the milk should be 
added and the whole, together with the sugar 
and a little salt, be brought to boiling point. 
If the cocoa is to be iced, as in tea, it should 
be made a little stronger than when served 
hot. To make iced cocoa or cocoa milk shake 
syrup, dissolve three pints of cocoa which is 
deficient in fat in a scant four cups of tepid 
water. Add four cups of granulated sugar 
and a few grains of salt, bring to boiling- 
point, boil hard for ten minutes, transfer to 
sterilized bottles, fill to overflowing, seal and 
use as desired. 

For cocoa milk shake take one-fourth cup 
of this syrup with sufficient milk to fill a 
tumbler. For a cocoa egg nog combine four 
tablespoons of syrup, one-half cup of milk, a 
few drops of vanilla and a well-beaten egg. 

All the drinks containing egg or milk, or 
malted milk are food drinks, so are butter- 
milk and kumiss. When they are used in 
the luncheon or supper menu they help to 
furnish the muscle-making balance. Egg 
drinks and simple milk shakes are excellent 
for children. 

There are two other food beverages which 
can be used with profit. One is a good 
"cereal coffee," containing plenty of hot milk; 
the other is a malted milk, containing a high 
food value. Both of these beverages may be 
served cold and can help to vary the Summer 
drinks for both adults and children. 

Summei- Drinks 

For a taste of something acid there should 
be plenty of lemons in the icebox, and other 
fresh fruits to make up refreshing drinks. 
Oftentimes there are a few left-overs, such 
as a dish of raspberries, some peaches, half 
of an orange, a few currants, which can be 
brought to boiling point with a little water 
and strained — to which can be added a littlo 
lemon .iuice, sufficient iced water for dilution 
and either sugar or syrup to sweeten. 

Then there is grape juice, ginger ale, the 
juice from canned pineapple, bottled logan- 
berry — lime — grape and apple juice may be 
secured and kept, on hand. These refreshing 
drmks belong in the menu, because of their 
acidity, which whips the liver into action and 
helps to cleanse the blood, and because they 
are a means of introducing more water 
which helps to induce perspiration and cool- 
ness. If they are used in a meal, however 
cream or milk should not appear.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

Remember that when a cereal is served, a rather 
bland fruit should be selected. Instead of cooking 
oatmeal always in milk, substitute for it corn- 
meal, hominy, rice, or farina. This will give a 
change for each week in the month. Instead of 
always serving corn fritters, try new apple frit- 
ters, peach fritters, or clam fritters. Substitute 
ham for bacon; fish for meat in the meat and 
potato Cakes ; tomato omelet for shirred eggs ; po- 
tato and nut balls for nut loaf ; thin slices of 
broiled ham for boiled eggs ; creamed salmon for 
frizzled dried beef ; and baked bacon for codfish 
cakes. 

Luncheon or Supper 

Occasionally, for the main dish, try fried egg 
plant with creamed corn ; salmon salad made with 
peas and shredded cabbage ; cottage cheese balls 
on slices of tomato ; creamed tuna fish combined 
with cooked macaroni ; stewed corn ; Italian spa- 
ghetti ; or escalloped potatoes and cheese. For 
dessert, use any of the custard mixtures instead 
of baked custard, as bread custard ; floating is- 
land ; cereal custard pudding. For the ginger 
cookies, use bran or oatmeal cookies, or any 
simple cake; for the caramel bread pudding, try 
an old-fashioned bread and fruit pudding ; instead 
of coffee cake, try individual, peach .shortcakes ; 
and instead of raisin bread and butter and warm 



gingerbread, use a cornstarch pudding, a fruit 
tapioca, sponge cake, or peach cobbler. 

Dinner 

Plan occasionally to have a pot roast, a small 
baked Virginia ham, or corned beef. From the 
pot roast you can serve cold, sliced beef with 
horseradish sauce ; the ham can be used up in 
various ways, several of which are given in this 
book ; and what is left of the corned beef may be 
served cold for the next day at luncheon. In- 
stead of potatoes, use boiled rice ; creamed nood- 
les, or. spaghetti. For vegetables, the market or 
garden must be dictator. It is a good rule to 
follow, that at least one vegetable of pronounced 
color should be introduced into a menu, so draw 
liberally upon string beans, carrots and tomatoes ; 
and if you have a salad with a high aesthetic 
touch, use a vegetable that is less decorative, as 
corn, creamed cucumbers, or cabbage. For des- 
sert, draw heavily upon the fruits — they are 
cooling and therefore appetizing. Any kind of 
shortcake may be substituted for peach shortcake, 
such as blueberry or blackberry shortcake. Any 
fruit "Betty" may be used, as cherry, peach, or 
apple ; blackberry mold may be substituted for 
blueberry mold ; the charlotte russe may be varied 
by beating a little dry cocoa into the cream ; the 
sponge cup cakes may be served with stewed 
blackberries, instead of cocoa sauce.

Oatmeal Coolied in MUk 

TT IS often convenient to serve cereal as the

if sufficient milk is served with it to balance the 
meal. In many cases cream is preferred by vari- 
ous members of the family, so, in order to add 
sufficient muscle-making nutriment, it is necessary 
to add milk to the oatmeal or cereal while cooking.

Flavorings and Seasonings 



THK difference between cooking and good 
cooking has always been a matter of the 
proper seasoning and flavoring. Spices 
and herbs of all kinds were sought after in 
such degree that the discovery of our western 
hemisphere was in part due to the quest of 
the old explorers for the fragrant spice lands 
of the East. 

But it has taken years of scientific experi- 
mentation to bring us to the point where we 
can have them bottled in liquid form on the 
kitchen shelf. 

Not long ago it was necessary to stock the 
pantry with all kinds of dried seasonings and 
a long array of spice boxes, but it is all a 
part of progress that the selfsame spices 
and many of the much-used seasonings, as 
celery, onion, garlic and the like, as well as 
a bewildering array of extracts, can be pur- 
chased in liquid as well as other forms and 
at the same time be both economical and 
practical. 

Modem Flavorings Conserve the 
Honsevpife's Time 

In everything pertaining to the home the 
modern tendency is toward condensation and 
efllciency. It has become necessary, on ac- 
count of the ever-increasing help problem, 
to minimize the housewife's labor in every 
possible way. This is probably why season- 
ings, as well as flavorings, have been put in 
essence form. They take up little space, fit 
equally well into the kitchenette or pantry, 
do not deteriorate on standing, and may lit- 
erally be used in "a jiffy." Think of the 
time, for instance, it takes to patiently scrape 
up onion juice from the surface of a cut 
onion in comparison with the moment it 
takes to open a bottle and add a drop or so 
of onion extract to the dish that is being 
prepared. 

Varying the Flavor 

My pupils, many of whom are experienced 
housewives, study with interest the array of 
flavorings and seasonings that may always 
be found in my experiment kitchen. There 
are not only vanilla, lemon, orange, pistachio, 
almond and rose, but, in addition, a group of 
bewildering fruit flavorings, and spices and 
spice essences as well. "For what are all 
these used?" they ask. "I only find it neces- 



sary to buy vanilla and lemon." Then I ex- 
plain that one of the newest things about 
modern cookery is the use of the flavorings 
and seasonings that great manufacturers are 
preparing for the betterment and simplifying 
of cooking. 

EverV family becomes tired of the "same 
old thing." I frequently visit households 
in which the taste of the food is always 
the same. The family appetites are gen-' 
erally flagging, and the housewives complain 
of the monotony of their work. These house- 
holds need a change of food, not necessarily 
to strange and bizarre dishes, but a change 
in the usual diet, such as a little cherry or 
raspberry extract instead of so much vanilla 
in the tapioca pudding; a carefully-blended 
mixture of spices in the grape- juice gelatine; 
or a hint of vanilla, lemon and rose in com- 
bination in the everyday recipe. At first this 
may sound a little extreme, but it is really 
nothing but good, sound psychology. It has 
been proved, over and over again, that when 
a family tires of a certain kind of food they 
will still like it in another form. 

Seasoning Balance 

Neither is it an extravagance to keep on 
hand a variety of extracts. It simply means 
a small outlay at the beginning. A little ex- 
perimentation will soon show you how they 
can be used in flavoring and making delicious 
those economical dishes that tlie family 
usually disdains! 

A Seasoning Basket and What 
It Should Contain 

I always keep a seasoning basket beside my 
kitchen stove. In it is a salt shaker, a pep- 
per shaker and still a third one, containing 
a blend of seven parts of salt to one of pep- 
per- — ^just the right proportion for general 
seasoning — some poultry seasoning, dried 
powdered parsley, a bottle of mace, one each 
of celery, onion and garlic extract or salt, 
together with catchup and Worcestershire. 
Whenever a soup is made of left-overs or I 
make up one of those nondescript dishes of 
meat left from the baby's broth, this season- 
ing basket is called upon to make the food 
delicious and appetizing. Salt and pepper, 
alone, would not . be enough. Sometimes a 
mixture of two or three in sparing quantities 
will save the day. The seasonings which go 
into the various dishes and make them what 
they are when they appear on the table are 
both the spice and essence of life.

Variations'; pf the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

Now that the weather is becoming cooler, break- 
fast can be more substantial. All of the hot muf- 
fins will be welcome, and what a list there is ! 
Corn muffins, nut-raisin — graham — rye — entire 
wheat — cereal muffins and plain muffins into the 
batter for which a little left-over cooked bacon or 
minced ham may be stirred. Baking powder bis- 
cuits are in order-neither plain with butter, or 
with syrup or honey. Spoon bread — French toast, 
corn fritters, pancakes baked on an unoiled grid- 
dle, waffles, either plain or containing a little left- 
over rice or corn scraped from the cob, are easily 
made. With a list of such suggestions, why 
should breakfast ever become monotonous ! 

^~- Luncheon or Supper 

As the fall comes on the noon luncheon must 
change in character. At least three times a week 
a substantial soup may constitute the main dish — 
and if sufficient variety is introduced, the family 
will welcome it. When this is done, it is possible 
to provide adequately for all members of the fam- 
ily with almost no extra cooking. There are all 
the substantial soups of legumes as split pea, 



dried lima beans, lentils and kidney beans, that 
are meat substitutes ; cream soups made with 
milk also belong in this classification. When any 
of these are served, a fruit dessert is apropos — 
but if a plain vegetable soup is introduced, the 
muscle making balance must be made up in the 
dessert. Baked custard, rice and raisins cooked 
in milk, nuts in the shell, junket and almost any 
milk or egg desserts will accomplish this. 

Dinner 

There is no greater help in dinner getting than 
to have a meal that can be at least partly pre- 
pared in the morning while the general work is 
going on. Nearly all desserts can be at least 
started in the morning. All of the desserts sched- 
uled for these September dinner menus, can be 
done ahead — so in substituting others to create 
variety for the month, choose dishes of like char- 
acter, as for instance, molded farina instead of 
rice ; cup cakes or jelly balls for doughnuts ; baked 
fruit tapioca for Indian pudding ; caramel, coffee 
or lemon blanc mange for chocolate blanc mange ; 
any frtsh fruit instead of peaches ; peach or grape 
pie instead of apple, and peach or lemon sherbet 
instead or orange and date ice.

take about half an hour — drain and serve with 
White Sauce or with Hollandaise Sauce. 

Although cauliflower may appear a somewhat 
expensive vegetable to buy it is really economical 
provided one uses it to the best advantage. The 
flower may be boiled and served with a sauce as 
suggested ; the leaves can be boiled, chopped and 
seasoned with butter or bacon drippings ; the

or into dice, boiled and served with a cream sauce, 
Eollandaise Sauce or Cheese Sauce; while the 
liquor in which the cauliflower was cooked can be 
used as a base for a cream soup. The stalks of 
the flower may be cooked at the same time the 
flower is cooked and then reserved for a sub- 
sequent meal. In this way the liquor will have 
more strength and flavor and cooking time and

add to it the milk and the melted shortening auil 
use these ingredients to form a soft, light dough 
when blended with the dry ingredients. Roll out 
about half an inch thick on a well floured board, 
cut and drop each doughnut gently into hot fat, 
hot enough to brown a bit of bread in a minute, 
turn immediately and when golden brown lift one

paper. The doughmits should take about three 
minutes to cook. Sprinkle with powdered sugar 
before serving. 

A good way to sugar the doughnuts is to put 
three tablespoons of powdered sugar into a strong 
paper bag, drop six or eight doughnuts into this 
sugar, shake the bag thoroughly, then lift out 
and repeat the process until all have been 
sugared.

low baking dish or stew-pan, add the water and 
sugar which have been boiled together five minutes 
w^ith the cloves, cinnamon or lemon rind, which- 
ever is being used, and let the fruit and syrup 
simmer gently until the fruit is tender, turning 
occasionally so that all may be cooked. The 
skins should not burst during the cooking. When 
cool, place the apples or pears in a serving dish. 
pour the syrup over them (it should form a

the mixture leaves the sides of the pan clean. 
Remove from the heat, cool, then add the eggs, 
unbeaten, one at a time. As each egg is added 
the mixture will appear rather sticky and un- 
manageable, but a little beating quickly incor- 
porates the egg into it. When all of the eggs 
are beaten in, drop the mixture by tablespoons, 
three inches apart on an oiled baking sheet and 
bake half an hour in a moderate oven — about 
350° F. 

The above quantity will make about ten Cream

Cereals — Cooked and Uncooked 



CEREALS, although among our most impor- 
tant foods, are not used sufficiently, with 
the exception of wheat, which is, of course, 
found on nearly all tables three times a day. 
When we speak of cereals most of us think of 
the more familiar oatmeal, cornmeal, rice and 
the better known fine wheaten cereals. We 
forget about entire wheat, brown rice, cracked 
wheat, whole oatmeal, hominy and samp, all 
of which can be used advantageously to in- 
crease one's cereal vocabulary. 

Then there are the pastes — macaroni, spa- 
ghetti, noodles and their colleagues, which also 
belong to the cereal family, because they are 
made of a certain kind of wheat which is very 
rich in muscle-making properties. 

In addition to these cereals we have the 
wide variety of ready-prepared cereal foods in 
the form of flakes, granules and puffed grains. 
Regarding the whole gamut of cereals, how- 
ever, there seems to be considerable lack of 
true knowledge. I frequently hear women 
say: "Flakes should not be given, as they 
have no food value." On the other hand, they 
will feed the child white bread! 

Food Value Explained 

Now, just what is meant by this term, "food 
value," in connection with cereals ? Cereals are 
classified primarily as starches, or energizing 
foods. It is under this classification that we 
find white flour, as well as all flours, bread, 
crackers, etc. (See "The Balanced Ration.") 
Nearly all of these foods, during the process 
of preparation, have some of the food value 
removed, and it is to this that so many women 
refer. 

In making up some of the ready-to-eat 
cereals, as well as in the making of white 
flour, many oatmeal and cornmeal prepara- 
tions, and the milling of white rice, the vita- 
mines are removed along with the husks and, 
in some cases, the hearts of the grains. That 
is the reason why, whenever possible, brown 
rice, whole oatmeal, old-fashioned, water- 
ground cornmeal, and entire wheat flour 
should be used. 

But, if it is not possible to use these foods, 
all of the food value has not been taken out of 
the cereal that remains, for the starch — a 
certain percent of protein — many of the min- 
erals and some of the ash and fat have been 
left, and if the cereals are served with milk, 
with butter or cream, part of the missing vita- 
mine element is made up. 

Most cereals which need cooking, no matter 
in what form they are to be served, are first 
cooked by the usual method; that is, they are 




put on in salted boiling water for a prescribed 
length of time — fifteen minutes over a direct 
heat — to burst the starch grains, of which 
they are largely composed, and anywhere 
from thirty minutes to three or four hours in 
a double boiler — the time depending upon the 
cereal. (See Time Table for Cooking Cereals.) 
When a hot cereal is to be used for the 
main dish at breakfast, it should be cooked, at 
least partly, in milk (see recipe for Oatmeal 
Cooked in Milk) for this, together with the 
additional milk used in its service, is sufficient 
to provide the muscle-making element of the 
meal. 

Other Uses for Cereals 

But cereals can be used at other meals be- 
sides breakfast. Rice, oatmeal or fine hominy 
cooked in milk with a few raisins, dates or flgs 
make an excellent luncheon or supper dish for 
children, or dessert for the whole family. On 
the other hand, instead of using milk, fruit 
juice may be substituted — ^when the cereal 
takes on a very different character. If any of 
the cereals are left over they may be mixed 
with very few bread crumbs and an egg yolk 
to two cups of cereal, made into flat cakes, 
rolled in flour, then browned and served in- 
stead of potato, or as a dessert with melted 
jelly, preserves or syrup. It is a waste of both 
time and fuel to cook only enough cereal for 
one meal. 

Again, a substantial luncheon soup may be 
made up very quickly, if one keeps on hand 
some soup stock, a jar of diced vegetables, 
which have been cooked and are kept, to- 
gether with the cooking liquid, and left-over 
cereal; they simply have to be put together, 
then heated and served with or without grated 
cheese, as they do in Italy. 

As to the cereal breads, one can add cold 
cooked cereal to almost any of the plain hot- 
bread mixtures to achieve quite unusual re- 
sults. The cereal muffins in this book are an 
example of this type of cookery. Any of the 
grain-cooked cereals can be added to a grid- 
dle-cake mixture, to a waffle mixture, or to 
fritters, changing the flavor and the texture 
by introducing something a little different. In 
other words, the family will not get tired of 
cereals if they are only used with intelligence. 

One of the most delightful "company" des- 
serts I ever had served to me (and this was at 
a "real dinner") was plain farina cooked in 
milk, molded and chilled, and served with 
crushed strawberries, which had been sweet- 
ened, and plenty of whipped and sweetened 
cream.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

Now that the cold weather is coming on, do not 
make the mistake of cutting out fruit from the 
breakfast menu. For it is only by serving suffi- 
cient fruit fron October to March that we are 
able to keep in perfect physical condition. There 
are pears, grapes, the late cantaloupes, oranges, 
grapefruit, delicious apples, and all of the dried 
fruits to offer variety. Occasionally if the morn- 
ing seems particularly sharp, give the children 
cocoa instead of milk. Many mothers notice that 
as the cold weather comes on, children do not 
seem to like to drink as much milk as they 
should. This is often because it is served cold to 
them, instead of warm, so be sure to take off the 
chill, if you expect them to thrive. 

Luncheon or Supper 

The old-fashioned luncheon or supper dessert 
of cooked fruit and cake or cookies is now being 
frequently superseded by the serving of simple 
Qooked dessert in which the two, one might say, 
are combined. Examples of such desserts are : 
Apple Betty, Oatmeal Pudding with Raisins. Old- 
Fashioned Rice Pudding. Baked Indian Pudding, 
Warm Gingerbread with Marshmallow Creme 
Sauce, or any of the fruit shortcakes. It will give 



the family a pleasant surprise if you substitute 
some of these simply-made desserts for the sauce 
and cake with which they have been served so 
long. 

Dinner 

If you study these menus closely, you will 
notice that we are now beginning to think about 
pork again. During the summer months it is not 
so desirable a food as when the weather is cooler, 
because it is over- rich in fat for the warm 
weather. On Tuesday I have planned Pork Ten- 
derloins ; these may be obtained either fresh or 
smoked, and in case one lives some distance from 
a market and can shop only once or at most, 
twice a week for meat, it is necessary to fall back 
during part of each week on some form of 
smoked meat. 

Instead of the tenderloins one could substitute 
Smoked or Pickled Tongue, Smoked Ham, or Salt 
Mackerel plain broiled, or served with lemon, or 
baked in milk. 

It will be noticed that all of these dinner menus 
are especially economical in that the meats chosen 
are not costly, with the exception of the Roast 
Chicken scheduled for Sunday. In case chicken 
is expensive, I would suggest the substitution of 
Roast Breast of Lamb or Veal prepared with a 
moist, well-seasoned bread stuffing.

1 1^ tablespoons granu- 
lated gelatine 

CARAMELIZE one-quarter cup of sugar by 
placing it, dry, in a heavy frying pan and 
stirring it over a gentle heat until golden brown. 
The sugar must be watched carefully as jt readily 
Burns. As soon as melted, add the boiling coffee 
to it — use a long handled vessel to pour it from 
as caramelized sugar is intensely _ hot and the 
steam rising from the cofEee as it is poured out 
might easily burn the hand if it were too close. 
Cook until smooth. Meanwhile soften gelatine in 
cold w-ater, dissolve in hot cofEee, add remaining 
sugar and when partly cooled, the vanilla. Turn 
into molds which have been dipped in cold water, 
chill, unmold and serve with garnish of whipped 
cream.

hot water. Add with lemon juice to chopped 
prunes. When almost cold add cream or evap- 
orated milk which has been whipped stiffly. Beat, 



1 tablespoon gelatine 

% cup prune juice 

1 tablespoon lemon juice 




thoroughly together and drop by tablespoons into 
a deep dish containing soft custard. 

To whip evaporated milk — set the can contain- 
ing it in a pan of cold water, bring to boiling 
point rapidly, chill at once and whip as you would 
ordinary cream. 

Smoked Fork Tenderloins with Spinach 

IF TENDERLOIN appears very dry soak it 
over-night in cold water. Scrub thoroughly 
and place in a pan with cold water to cover, bring 
slowly to boiling point and if water is very salt, 
replace with fresh, otherwise continue cooking in 
same water. As soon as water boils add a table- 
spoon of mixed whole pickling spices — cloves, bay 
leaves, pepper corns, mace, etc. The length of 
time needed for cooking will depend on size of ten- 
derloin — two pounds will probably take about one 
and one-half hours. Serve with boiled spinach 
which has been cooked until tender, finely chopped, 
seasoned, then packed into small molds or cups 
and allowed to stand ten minutes before turning 
out. Serve with Horseradish Brown Sauce.

Nuts, Nut Butters and Margarine 



JUST what is margarine? There are two 
kinds — one consists of higlily purified oleo 
oil, obtained from the fat of prime beef, 
combined with neutral, which comes from 
pork of the best quality. Sometimes a little 
vegetable oil, as peanut oil, is included. To 
these are added cream from, inspected dairy 
herds and all this is churned in whole milk, 
then worked with salt, like butter. The 
gradation depends upon the amount of cream 
in the product. 

The other type consists of one or more 
vegetable fats, as coconut fat, and so forth, 
which have been especially prepared and, 
like the other margarine, are churned in 
milk and worked with salt. The best grades 
contain no preservatives. Neither type of 
margarine is colored, the housewife herself 
coloring it, if she wishes, with the capsule of 
vegetable coloring which usually is given out 
with the package. 



Some of the Many Uses 

of Margarine in Cooking 

In using margarine instead of butter in 
the everyday menu, it m.ust be kept in mind 
that margarine contains a minimum of vita- 
mines and so, wlien it is used, a larger pro- 
portion of milk, whole grain cereals, citrous 
fruits and leafy vegetables must be provided, 
lest the diet be lacking in protectives. 

Although most widely known as a spread 
for bread, margarine is equally good for 
seasoning vegetable's and for use instead of 
butter in the making of pastry, sauces, cakes, 
etc. It g'oes farther than buttep as it is more 
concentrated, so — rWhen substituting it in a 
recipe calling for butter — use a .fifth less. It 
is not at all suited to frying, as it contains 
too much moisture. 



Nuts as a Valuable Source 

; of Vitamlnes 

Since time immemorial, Quts have been 
among our best foods. fi&a.'use of their 
well-balanced composition they, iji^tke excel- 
lent meat substitutes. All nuts are rich in 
fat, peanuts being especially so. It is an in- 
;teresting fact that peanut oil is extremely 



rich in vitamines; that is one of the reasons 
why peanut butter is such a valuable food. 
It is merely ground-up peanuts with the oil 
left in. The only well-founded objection to 
the eating of nuts, one might say, is based 
upon laziness, for if they are not well mas- 
ticated they are liable to be a bit hard to 
digest, because of the fat which they con- 
tain, but when they are ground up into nut 
butter this objection is overcome. 

Peanut oil is often added to margarine of 
either type. If peanut butter is a little dry 
it can be softened by the working in of a 
little peanut oil or good salad oil and forms 
an excellent spread for the children's bread. 
It is also very well adapted to the making of 
various meat substitute dishes, such as Po- 
tato and Peanut Butter Croquettes, Sweet 
Potato and Peanut Butter Loaf, Nut Cutlets, 
Macaroni with Peanut Butter Sauce, Peanut 
Butter Soup, and so on. 

It must be kept in mind, whenever nuts 
are served, or whenever a nut butter is in- 
troduced, that the foods are highly concen- 
trated and must be served in the menu with 
some bulky foods, such as a coarse grain 
bread, lettuce, fruit, or celery. 

The Function of Coconuts 

in the PamUy Diet 

While speaking about nuts we must not 
overlook the coconut, which is very rich in 
oil. This oil, as I have stated before, is often 
extracted and used in the making of nut 
butters. The dry coconut contains some 
forty per cent, of fat, as well as nearly 
twenty-five per cent, of sugar and starch. 
This brings up an interesting situation. 
When dry coconut is introduced into a dish, 
the amount of fat and sugar, generally used 
in it, can be decreased proportionately — a 
little point, but just another argument in 
fayor of a definite knowledge of food values. 

November, is usually a cold and blustery 
month; the body fires are taxed to their ut- 
most, so serve plenty of the fat foods, to your 
family that they? may store up reserve force, 
to keep them warm during the ensuing 
months of winter arid to draw upon 
slight cold or other illness happens 
way.

Refreshments for Little Affairs 




MORE and more, the tendency of the times 
is toward simplicity — simpler homes; 
simpler clothing'; simpler food! In fact, 
it is positively unfashionable to serve elab- 
orate meals, a six or seven course dinner being 
a breach of etiquette. 

Let us consider a little dinner of four 
courses: 

Suggestive Menu 

First Course: An unthickened soup; a fruit 
cocktail ; raw oysters ; canapes ; or a fish 
cocktail. 

Second Course: A substantial meat dish, as a 
roast ; chicken a la Maryland ; baked Vir- 
-ginia ham; or baked stuffed fish; or a nut 
loaf, in case a vegetarian meal is being pro- 
vided. 

This main dish would be accompanied by a 
starchy vegetable, as white or sweet potato ; 
rice ; or spaghetti ; or samp ; and one or two 
vegetables of contrasting color and flavor, as 
tomatoes and spinach. 

Third Course: A simple salad, as a vegetable 
salad ; or lettuce with shredded ripe olives 
and celery, put together with French dressing 
— not mayonnaise — and served with toasted 
crackers ; cheese crackers ; or cheese straws. 

Fourth Course: A simple dessert, which must be 
of fruit or acid character in case a fat meat 
or fish has been provided. Little individual 
pies ; Bavarian creams ; fruit sponges ; ice 
cream ; little assorted cakes and baked cus- 
tard with caramel sauce — all are suitable. 
Black coffee follows as soon as the dessert 
is served. 



Bread and butter are served throughout the 
meal up to dessert. 

Relishes are passed between the courses ; up 
to dessert and individual, small baskets of 
salted nuts may be provided, if desired. 
There is nothing in such a meal that is 

elaborate; it can be made extremely simple — - 

but the cooking must be perfect. 

Luncheon for L/adies 

In case of a ladies' luncheon, we could 
combine the main and the salad course, using 
a substantial salad as the main dish, such as: 
Tuna fish, celery and pimiento salad, put to- 
gether with Chili mayonnaise. 
Chicken and celery salad with or without a 
few seeded Malaga grapes, or bits of diced 
pineapple. 
Stuffed egg salad. 

Little bread and butter sandwiches, or but- 
tered rolls could be used as an accompani- 
ment. 
In planning for little affairs, when one de- 
sires just "a bite," the question of refresh- 
ments is very easily solved — two foods being 
sufficient. 

Suggestive suitable combinations for such 
little gatherings are: 

1. Individual Apple Pies piled with Whipped 
Cream. Coffee. 

2. Cream Puffs filled with ice cream and served 
with Rich Cocoa Sauce Grape Juice Punch. 

3. Charlotte Russe. Iced Tea or Iced Coffee. 

4. Toasted Cheese Sandwiches. Hot Coffee. 

5. Fruit Salad. Crisp Crackers. Coffee. 

6. Fudge Mocha Cake. Strawberry Punch.

Variations of the Basic Menus for Every Meal of the Month 



Breakfast 

Whenever an acid fruit appears, a similar acid 
fruit may be substituted; in case dried fruit is 
used, any other dried fruit may be put in. In 
case a fried food appears, such as corn fritters, 
a similar, starchy, fried food may be substituted — 
such as fried potatoes, or clam fritters. When- 
ever a cooked cereal is used, a similar cooked 
Cereal may be substituted, such as brown rice, 
instead of cracked wheat; if an uncooked cereal 
is called for, any uncooked, ready-prepared cereal 
may be substituted. In case a menu calls for a 
fish dish, any other fish dish may be used, such as 
creamed salmon, broiled salt mackerel, panned 
oysters, etc. 

Luncheon or Supper 

Any cream or vegetable soup may be used, such 

as cream of canned pea, spinach, oyster plant, or 

' potato, instead of cream of celery. Griddle cakes, 



waffles, or muffins may be used, instead of French 
toast. Clam chowder, or a fish bisque may ap- 
pear, instead of oyster stew ; dried bean, or pea, 
soup, instead of lentil soup, and so on. 

Dinner 

Veal may be substituted for lamb; plain sir- 
loin, or flank steak, for Hamburg steak; sliced 
heart, instead of liver ; and mutton,' instead of 
beef. The vegetables may be varied according to 
those in market or in the canned goods closet — if 
care is taken to use those of similar food value 
(see "Your Meals and Good Health") . Any gela- 
tine dessert may be used, instead of grape juice 
sponge; any type of fruit dumplings, or biscuit 
shortcake, instead of apple dumplings ; any sort 
of custard dessert, instead of tapioca cream; 
marble, nut, or raisin cake, instead of fudge cake ; 
any fruit whip, instead of fig souffle; and any

About Sweets 



"Only buttered bread will do — 
Inches thick, with sugar, too." 

EUGENE FIELD certainly had a great 
knowledge of child life or he never would 
have added, "Inches thick, with sugar, 
too." In grandmother's time it was molasses, 
instead of sugar, and years before that it was 
honey that gummed the kiddies' fingers. At 
that time sugar was not only very expensive, 
but honey was thought to be more wholesome 
than products "of forced invention." And 
unless sugar is eaten in moderation, this rule 
still holds true, for it is a well-known fact 
that sugar and lime have a remarkable affin- 
ity, so that when more sugar is consumed than 
can be used up in energy, the sugar takes up 
the soluble lime from the blood, which, in 
turn, finally takes it from the bones and teeth. 
Sugar does not act directly on the teeth; it 
has no effect directly on the enamel, the mis- 
chief .coming from the inside out. 

Sweets other than those planned in bal- 
anced menus must be added to the diet with 
discretion. They should never be eaten in 
large quantities unless there is a correspond- 
ing amount of physical exercise. Usually an 
abnormal desire for sugar is an indication that 
the diet is not properly balanced. 

The Two Branches of the Sugar Family 

Sugars may be divided into two groups — 
the sucroses, which include cane sugar, beet 
sugar, maple sugar, etc., and the glucoses, 
which include honey, corn syrup, etc. Beet 
sugar and cane sugar can be used identically 
in cooking, and there is no evidence for the 
statement so often made that beet sugar is 
more injurious to health than the cane. To 
the chemist they are identical. Neither is 
there any chemical difference between maple 
sugar and that derived from the cane or beet. 
But it contains ethereal substances which give 
it flavor. It also is rich in vitamines, which is 
not true of granulated sugar. 

Treacle and molasses are by-products re- 
sulting from the manufacture of sugar. A 
general analysis of molasses shows it to con- 
sist of forty-seven percent of cane sugar, 
twenty and four-tenths percent fruit sugar, 
two and seven-tenths percent salts and twen- 
ty-seven and three-tenths percent water, ac- 
cording to Hutchison. Honey is our best 
syrup; it does not irritate the stomach, be- 
cause its sugar is in predigested form, ready 
for immediate assimilation. Honey is very 
rich in vitamines, and can be safely given to 
very little children — as well as to the family 
in general. 



Com Syrup for Jams and JeUles 

Fruit jams and jellies may be described as 
fruit and fruit juice, preserved in a large 
amount of sugar. In these, the acids of the 
fruit, plus the high temperature of the cook- 
ing, bring about the conversion of a consider- 
able proportion of the sugar into invert form, 
and the larger the proportion of sugar in- 
verted, the more digestible the jam. Corn 
syrup or glucose is also used in making jams 
and jellies. It is composed of about one-half 
dextrin and one-half glucose, and is sweet, 
nutritious and easily digested. In fact, the 
commission appointed recently by the Mayor 
of New York for the investigation of high 
prices brought about by the war, recom- 
mended corn syrup most highly as a sugar 
substitute, not only for jams and jellies, but 
for all sorts of sweetenings. 



Sugar An Energy Builder 

It does not seem much to add a lump of 
sugar to a cup of cofCee or tea, or a spoonful 
or two to the cereal, but when one realizes 
that four ordinary lumps of sugar, weighing 
about five grams each, contain nearly as much 
carbohydrate as a medium-sized white potato, 
it is clear that it contributes in no small way 
to the supply of energy needed. It is said that 
a pound of butter will yield about twice as 
much energy as a pound of sugar, but the cost 
is nearly four times as much, for sugar is 
cheap food. However, it cannot replace fat 
in the diet, for it is more rapidly burned up. 
Guides and explorers and soldiers have long 
since been familiar with the value of sugar as 
a stimulant to muscular effort, while athletes 
are using it more and more during times o£ 
stress. 

Amount of Sweets Required Varies with the 
Seasons 

It is almost impossible to state the exact 
amount of sweets needed daily by each per- 
sop. As they are heating foods, they should 
be eaten sparingly in summer and more heart- 
ily in winter. The best form in which they 
can be introduced is as sweetening to tea, 
coffee and cocoa; jams and jellies, simple, 
sweet desserts, and the pure candies. It is a 
common fault to put sugar into everything, 
from lettuce to baked beans. That not only 
sets up indigestion, which is too often attrib- 
uted to other causes, but also destroys the 
natural flavors of the foods.

dried peas, lentils or kidney beans. Instead of the 
lamb broth on Tuesday use beef broth, cream of 
salmon soup, or veal broth with barley. On Wed- 
nesday use creamed lamb, meat loaf from left- 
over meat, or meat and potato balls. For the 



fried mush on Thursday use coarse cooked hominy 
or samp, baked cheese pudding, or potato and 
cheese croquettes. For the French toast on Fri- 
day substitute griddle cakes or waffles with 
creamed dried beef, bacon, or sausages. For the 
"dog biscuits" on Saturday use a sausage and 
potato loaf, toasted devilled ham sandwiches, or 
escalloped potato with sausage meat. 

Dinner 

To reduce the bills, substitute roast breast of 
lamb or veal for roast lamb ; casserole or beef for 
spiced beef, which would be made from the round ; 
casserole of lamb or beef instead of chicken and 
rice ; fish cakes or escalloped tuna fish for boiled 
codfish ; and Hamburg steak or lamb stew for 
broiled pork chops. 

As to desserts, any of the following may be 
used to advantage : 

Orange shortcake ; popovers filled with canned 
fruit and served with marshmallow sauce ; choco- 
late bread pudding ; apple or banana fritters ; 
apple sauce cake ; cottage pudding ; orange and 
date salad ; cherry Spanish cream ; caramel cof- 
fee jelly; escalloped apples with raisins ; bananas 
with lemon juice and sugar.

WOMAN'S WORLD CALENDAR COOK BOOK 

The Rang-e and Its Operation 

A Discussion of the Different Types 



A LITTLE thought and care will result in 
materially reducing the cost of cooking 
by gas. For instance, a steam cooker 
which operates over one burner makes it pos- 
sible to cook two or three things at one time, 
and even without a steam cooker one can still 
do this by the use of double and triple sauce- 
pans, all of which can be placed over one 
burner. 

The newest style of gas range has a solid 
top like that of a coal range, the heat from 
each burner radiating so that a large surface 
of the stove top around it is heated, and this 
materially reduces the gas bill, because two 
or three things can be cooking by this radi- 
ated heat. 

There are three sizes of burners on almo.st 
all gas ranges: 

A — The simmerer. 

B — The regular-sized burner. 

C — The giant burner. 

The simmerer is actually used less than 
any other burner, whereas it should be the 
hardest worked, for its heat is quite enough 
to carry on cooking operations after the boil- 
ing point has been reached. The giant burner 
should be employed only when very large 
cooking utensils are being used. 

Most gas-range directions instruct us to 
make toast on the broiling burner of the 
oven, but why use this large burner when the 
toast can be just as well made on a gas 
toaster placed over one of the top burners, 
which use only about one-fourth as much gas 
as the boiling burner? Gas can also be saved 
by boiling only just as much water in the tea 
kettle as will be actually needed. In other 
words, do not boil two quarts when only two 
cupfuls are needed. 

Be sure that the mixer is properly regulated, 
so that enough air is burned with the gas to 
give a blue flame and not a red one. The lat- 
ter wastes gas, soils the pans and gives off less 
heat than the blue flame. 

Tlie Coal Range 

To get the best results from a coal range it 
is necessary to understand thoroughly its 
drafts and mechanism. A little practice will 
soon show you how to adjust these so as to 
economize on fuel. 

In no part of one's housekeeping is proper 
planning of greater value than in connection 
with the range, whether it be gas or coal. On 
ironing day, when a hot fire is needed to heat 
the irons, plan an oven meal of the kind 



which needs little actual attention — Baked 
Potatoes, Poor Man's Rice Pudding or some 
Casserole dish. Then, on your regular baking 
day, plan for further baked dishes which can 
be held over for a subsequent day's meals, be- 
cause the same heat which will bake your pie 
will also bake potatoes, or will cook the cereal. 
As far as the care of the coal range is con- 
cerned, there are only two things which must 
be given serious consideration: 

A — Keep a clear fire by shaking down the 
greater part of the burned-out ashes 
which collect in the lower part of the 
grate, that the air may circulate free- 
ly, making the coals glow and give off 
their stored-up power. 
B — Keep the flues clean and clear of soot 
and dust, for if these are not kept clean 
you cannot have proper heat in the oven. 

The Kerosene Stove 

A kerosene stove is invaluable, especially 
for Summer use, where gas or electricity are 
not available. It is sometimes stated that oil 
is a dangerous form of fuel to use. All fire 
is dangerous unless intelligently handled, and 
there is no more reason for banishing an oil 
stove than any other stove. 

A three-burner oil stove with a portable 
oven will do the necessary cooking for a small 
family. Give it the same care that you would 
give to oil lamps. See that the oil tank is 
properly filled, that the wicks are trimmed, 
that they are long enough to reach properly 
into the oil, and be careful that the saucepans 
placed on the oil stove are not over-filled so 
that there is no danger of boiling over. 

Baking can be done just as thoroughly with 
oil as with any other fuel. In baking, use the 
upper shelf of the oven as much as possible, 
especially in the baking of pies with an under 
crust, because if baked too close to the fiame 
the under crust may become dverdone before 
the top and filling are cooked. 

Oven Temperatures 

In baking with any form of fuel^electricity, 
gas, coal or oil — remember that more food is 
spoiled by too much heat than by too little. 

Accustom yourself to the use of an oven 
thermometer. It is inexpensive, and it does 
give a feeling of assurance. 

A very slow oven, 250° to 300° F. 
A moderate oven, 325° to 350° F. 
A hot oven, .350° to 375° F. 
A very hot oven, 375° to 450° F.

WOMAN'S WORLD CALENDAR COOK BOOK 

Setting the Table for an Informal Dinner 



THE menu should be thougrht out some 
time ahead, in order to have it delicious 
easily prepared and simple to serve. Like 
everything else that is well done, the success 
of the maidless company dinner, luncheon or 
supper, depends upon forehandedness. 

In just what way -would one go about pre- 
paring and serving a company dinner menu 
without extra assistance ? Assuming that the 
brunt of the weekly cleaning was completed 
two days before the affair, the actual preced- 
ing day's work could be simplified — the extra 
time being given over to the preparation of a 
generous part of the dinner Itself. 

If much of the actual cookery has been 
done the day before, there will be ample time 
on the day itself to set and decorate the table. 

For a dinner, it is customary to use a full- 
sized tablecloth, as this makes a plain back- 
ground, and the silence-cloth underneath acts 
as protection for the table top. Twenty inches 
of space should be allowed to each cover. 

"For a luncheon or supper, doilies or runners 
are usually selected, and for a supper either 
these may be used, or a yard, or a yard and a 
half tea cloth is considered good form. 

Arrangement of Silver 

The silver for the .meal, up to dessert, 
should be put in place' a half inch from the 
edge of the table, — the spoons and knives be- 
ing arranged at the right in their order of use, 
from right to left, the forks being placed at 
the left in their order of use, from left to right. 

The napkins should be placed at the left and 
the bread and butter plates, with the spread- 
ers laid horizontally across the lower edges, 
should be set above the forks. A set of salts 
and peppers should be allowed for each two 
people. Goblets are generally used for a din- 
ner, tumblers for other affairs; and individual 
nut cups may be provided if salted nuts are 




served, in which case they should be placed 
above the service plates, which are put 
in position when the table is laid, ready (or 
the first course, and later for the soup. It is 
permissible, when no maid is in attendance to 
lay the fork and spoon for the dessert service 
above the plates. 

The central decoration should not be over 
high, nor very large. Candles are used for 
evening dinners and suppers. 

Place cards, which may be attached to 
favors mark the places for the guests. 

The buffet or serving-table should contain 
an extra supply of butter balls, bread, a 
pitcher of water, the salad appurtenances and 
the coffee service arranged on a tray. 

After the first course is eaten, the hostess — 
or better still, some member of her family — 
should quietly rise and clear the table. The 
plates for the main part of the meal should 
then be set in front of the host, and the main 
dish put before him for serving; the vegetables 
may be served by a close friend or relative 
who is sitting at the left, then follow the good 
old-fashioned rule of "passing along." 

When the main course has been finished, it 
should be quietly and unostentatiously re- 
moved, — the next course then being put in 
position. If a salad, it may be arranged in 
a bowl and served by the hostess at the table, 
the salad accompaniments being passed infor- 
mally,- — or if a more elaborate salad is pro- 
vided, it may be arranged beforehand. 

After the removal of the salad course, the 
table should be crumbed by means of a soft 
napkin onto a plate, — the dessert, with the 
serving dishes, set in position, and served by 
the hostess; this is followed by coffee, prefer- 
ably in the living-room. Candies may be 
passed at this time.

Recipe in "Cake Secrets" 

Don't Waste Good Cake Ingredients! 

By far the largest proportion of cake — and therefore the most important 
mgredient — is the flour. You use the same choice eggs and butter and flavor- 
ing whether you make ordinary substantial cake or a light, flufify delicacy 
that's a real treat. 

The use of SWANS DOWN C.\KE FLOUR practically guarantees 
that soft, fine-grained consistency which is the \ery essence of good cake. 
To assure the uniform velvety smoothness of Swans Down, selected soft 
winter wheat is specially ground and sifted through closely woven silk. No 
drying cornstarch or other ingredient is added — one reason why Swans 
Down cake keeps moist and fresh to the last tempting morsel. Of course, 
such cake is always whiter and far more delicate than it is possible to 
make with a comparatively hea\'y bread flour 

If you wish the satisfaction (jf making deiici'vja cake every time you 



bake — at the same time doing away with the 
expensive waste of failures — use
