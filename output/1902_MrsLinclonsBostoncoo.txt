PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION 



When the "Boston Cook Book" was first published, 
cooking schools were in their infancy, and some sugges- 
tions as to their management were included in its pages. 
But now, after sixteen years' dissemination of these sug- 
gestions, it seems no longer advisable to include them in 
a cook book. Therefore, in making this first revision of 
my book I have utilized the pages previously devoted to 
this subject and to the general index, which is superfluous, 
as the alphabetical index is so comprehensive, also the 
blank spaces at the end of some chapters, for about three 
hundred additional recipes, and this without increasing the 
size or the price. 

The subject of each section forms the heading of the 
page. 

Since granulated gelatine and baking powder are now 
so universally used, the proportions of each are given 
where needed. Recipes for many new food products are 
inserted, and many minor changes made in the text. 

This revised edition is not the neiv book which has been 
in preparation for some time. Unavoidable delays in the 
completion of the latter and the large demand for extra 
copies from many persons who have worn out their first 



viii Preface to the Revised Edition, 

books have led me to make this revision of the "Boston 
Cook Book " now. 

The new book will contain many features not practicable 
here, and is designed not to supplant but to supplemerit 
my first book.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION. 



To compile a book which shall be not only a collection 
of receipts, given briefly for the experienced housekeeper, 
and with sufficient clearness for the beginner, but which 
shall also embody enougli of physiolog}^ and of the chem- 
istr}' and philosoph}' of food, to make ever}' principle in- 
telligible to a child and interesting to the mature mind ; 
which shall serve equally well for the cook in the kitchen, 
the pupil in the school-room, and the teacher in the normal 
class, — is a difficult task. Yet the need of a book of 
moderate cost, containing in a reasonably small compass all 
this and much more, has been seriously felt by all who are 
engaged in teaching cookery. Moreover, there is a special 
reason for the publication of this work. It is undertaken 
at the urgent request of the pupils of the Boston Cooking 
School, who have desired that the receipts and lessons 
given during the last four years in that institution should 
be arranged in a permanent form. 

To one who from childhood has been trained in all de- 
tails of housework, learning by observation or by actual 
experience much that it is impossible to receive from 
books, the amount of ignorance shown by many women is 
surprising. That a person of ordinary intelligence pre- 
siding over her household can be satisfied with onlj^ a 
vague conception of the common domestic methods, or 
that an}' true woman can see anything degrading in any 
labor necessary for the highest physical condition of her 



Preface, 



famil}', would be incredible if the truth of it were not 
dail}' manifest. 

Happil}', popular opinion now decides that no 3^oung 
lady's education is complete without a course of training 
in one or more branches of domestic work. And those 
who are not so fortunate as to have the best of all train- 
ing — that of actual work under a wise and competent 
mother — gladly resort to the cooking- schools for in- 
struction. 

In compiling these receipts for use in a school and in 
the family, several things were demanded. In a school 
of pupils from every class and station in life, a great 
variet}' of receipts is desirable. They must be clear, 
but concise, for those who are already well grounded in 
first principles. They must be explained, illustrated, and 
reiterated for the inexperienced and the careless. They 
must have a word of caution for those who seem alwaj'S 
to have the knack of doing the wrong thing. They must 
include the most healthful foods for those who have been 
made ill by improper food ; the cheapest as well as the 
most nutritious, for the laboring class ; the richest and 
most elaboratelj" prepared, for those who can afford them 
phj'sically as well as pecuniaril3\ 

These receipts are not a mere compilation. A large 
portion have accumulated during a long period of house- 
keeping ; and man}' have been received from friends who 
are practical housekeepers. Others have been taken from 
standard authorities on cooking ; and all have been fre- 
quently and thoroughly tested by pupils under the eye of 
the author. As far as possible, acknowledgment has been 
made for the receipts received. Where changes and im- 
provements have been made, or where there were many 
authorities for the same formula, no credit has been given. 

Some cook-books presuppose the presence of an as- 
sistant ; but as three fourths of the women in this country 



Preface. xi 



do their own work, these receipts are arranged so as to 
require the attention of but one person. 

It is proverbial that 3'oung housekeepers are often 
greatly perplexed in attempting to provide little enough 
for onl}- two. For their benefit man}' of our receipts are 
prepared on a scale of smaller measurements. 

The materials to be used are given in the order in which 
the\^ are to be put together. They are arranged in col- 
umns, where the e3'e may catch them readily, or in italics 
where economy of space seemed desirable. 

Every caution or suggestion has been given at the re- 
quest of some pupil who failed to find in other books just 
what she needed ; or because, in the experience of teach- 
ing, it has been shown that, unless forewarned, pupils 
inevitably make certain mistakes. Many subjects which 
in other books are omitted or given briefly, will be found 
to have received here an extensive treatment, because 
they have seemed of paramount importance. 

All the chemical and physiological knowledge that is 
necessar}' for a clear understanding of the laws of health, 
so far as they are involved in the science of cooker}', is 
given in this book. Nine tenths of the women who go 
through a scientific course in seminaries never put any 
of the knowledge gained into practical use. B3' the time 
they have occasion to use such knowledge in their own 
homes, the Chemistr}' and Physiolog}' have been relegated 
to the attic, where they help mice to material for their 
nests, but help no woman to apply the principles of 
science upon which the health and welfare of her house- 
hold largely depend. 

The statement will appear incredible to most people, 
and yet it is true, that many women do not know what 
the simplest things in our daily food are ; cannot tell when 
water boils, or the diflTerence between lamb and veal, lard 
and drippings. They cannot give the names of kitchen 



xii Preface. 



utensils ; do not know anj^thing about a stove, or how to 
pare a potato. This will explain what might otherwise 
seem an unnecessary minuteness of detail. The expe- 
rience of such ignorance also suggested the sub-title of 
the " Boston Cook Book," — " What to do and what not 
to do in Cooking," — just how to hold your bowl and spoon, 
to use 3'our hands, to regulate your stove, to wash 3'our 
dishes ; and just how not to fall into the errors into which 
so many have stumbled before you. But, more than all, 
it is attempted to give a reason for every step taken, and 
a clear answer to any questions that are likely to arise in 
the experience of either housekeeper or cook. 

A WORD of grateful acknowledgment is due the many 
friends who have aided in this work. 

First, to my mother I owe much for her excellent judg- 
ment in training me as a child to a love for all house- 
hold work. Although it was often hard to " help mother " 
when other children were at pla}^ the knowledge thus 
gained has proved invaluable. Every 3'ear's experience 
in teaching has made me prize more and more this early 
training. 

Also, I am deeply indebted to Miss M. S. Devereux 
for the illustrations of this book. In all my work I have 
been greatly aided by her suggestions and generous 
sympathy. 

And, lastly, I would not forget my obligations to a large 
circle of personal friends. Especially would I remember 
the one who, twent}^ years ago, aided me in making my 
first loaf of bread, and the many among my pupils who, 
out of their vai'ied experience, have contributed much that 
has proved helpful.

THE BOSTO:?^ COOK BOOK. 



COOKERY 

Cookery is the art of preparing food for tlie nourish- 
ment of the human body. AVhen given its proper impor- 
tance in the consideration of health and comfort, it must 
be based upon scientific principles of hygiene and what 
the French call the minor moralities of the household. 
All civilized nations cook their food, to improve its taste 
and digestibility. The degree of civilization is often 
measured by the cuisine. 

Cooking (from the Latin coquo, to boil, bake, heat, dry, 
scorch, or ripen) is usually done by the direct application 
of heat. Fruits and some vegetables which are eaten in a 
natural state have really been cooked or ripened by the 
heat of the sun. ]Milk and eggs, which are tj^pes of per- 
fect food, would be useless as food unless they came from 
the warm living animal. Fish, flesh, and fruits which 
have been dried in the sun or smoked, and are often eaten 
without any further preparation, have undergone a certain 
process of natural cooking. 

Heat seems to create new flavors, and to change the 
odor, taste, and digestibility of nearly all articles of food. 
It swells and bursts the starch cells in flour, rice, and 
potatoes; hardens the albumen in eggs, fish, and meat; 
softens the fibrous substances in tough meats, hard vege- 
tables and fruits. It develops new flavors in tea, coflfee, 
roasted meat, crusts of bread, baked beans, etc. 

X 



The Boston Cook Book, 



Cold is also an important matter to be regarded in the 
preparation of food. Sweet dislies and certain flavors, 
lilie hone}', ices, and custards ; the water, wine, or milk we 
drink ; our butter, fruits, and salads, — are all more pala- 
table when cold. 

Water ^ or some other liquid, in connection with heat is 
necessar}' in man}' forms of cookery. Grains, peas, beans, 
dried fruits which have parted with nearly all their moisture 
in the ripening or drying process necessary for their preser- 
A'^ation, need a large portion of water in cooking, to soften 
and swell the cellulose, gluten, and starch before they can 
be masticated and digested. In some vegetables and fruits 
water draws out certain undesirable flavors ; it softens 
and dissolves the gelatinous portions of meat, and makes 
palatable and nourishing many substances which would be 
rendered unwholesome by a dry heat. 

Air^ or the free action of oxygen, upon our food while 
cooking develops certain flavors not otherwise to be ob- 
tained. Meat roasted or broiled has a much finer flavor 
than when boiled, baked, or fried. Toasted bread, thin 
corn cake baked before the fire, roasted apples, and many 
articles cooked in the open air, show the benefit of this 
free combined action of heat and air. 

Drying in the sun was one of the earliest modes of 
cookery. Then came roasting before an open fire, or 
broihng over the coals, and baking in the hot ashes. 
This last was the primitive oven. As the art of making 
cooking-utensils developed, stewing, boiUng, and frying 
were adopted. Then, to economize heat, portable ovens 
were invented ; these were originally a covered dish set 
over or near the fire, having sometimes a double cover 
filled with coals. Afterwards, stoves which kept the fire 
and heat in a limited space were introduced ; and im- 
provements have been made in them so extensively that 
we now have them with conveniences for doing every form 
of cooking with wood, coal, oil, or gas. 

Some one gives tliis distinction between man and other 
animals : " Man is an animal that builds a fire and uses it 



Fire. 3 

to cook his food." It is quite important then, as a step- 
ping-stone to cooking, to learn the properties and manage- 
ment of a fii-e. 

Fire. 

Fire is heat and light produced by the combustion of 
Inflammable substances. Combustion is a chemical opera- 
tion carried on in the air, or the chemical union of the 
ox3'gen of the air with some combustible bod}', like h}'- 
drogen gas or the solid carbon, and is attended with the 
evolution of heat and light. The heat and the light come 
from the sun. With every particle of vegetable matter 
that is formed by the combined action of the sun and the 
carbonic acid gas in the air, a portion of the sun's heat 
and light is absorbed and held fast in it. And whenever 
this vegetable matter is decomposed, — as in burning wood, 
coal, or oil, which are only definite forms of vegetable mat- 
ter, — this heat and light are given out. The amount of 
each depends upon the mode of burning. 

Air is composed mainh' of two elementary gases, oxygen 
and nitrogen (one part oxygen and four parts nitrogen), 
with a small amount of watery vapor and carbonic acid gas. 

Pure oxygen is a gas x.hich has a wonderful attraction 
for, and power of combination with, ever}' other element. 
If it were ever}' where present in a perfectl}' pure state, it 
would consume or burn up everything ; but it is diluted 
or mixed (not combined) with nitrogen, another gas which 
IS incombustible, and which lessens the combustibilit}' of 
ever3'thing with which it comes in contact. Owing to this 
dilution, the oxygen will not unite with the carbon and 
hydrogen with which it is everywhere surrounded, and 
produce rapid combustion, except at a high temperature. 
The temperature at which this union takes place is called 
the burning-point, and this varies in difierent substances. 
Thus combustion is within the power and control of man ; 
and some extra means are usually employed to increase 
the temperature to the burning-point, — friction, or per- 
cussion, or the use of some more highly inflammable 



The Boston Cook Book. 



substances, like sulphur and phosphorus. This produces 
heat sufficient to complete the chemical union, or, in com- 
mon phrase, '" kindles the fire." 

The heat generated for all household purposes is produced 
b}' the chemical action of the ox3'gen of the air upon the hy- 
drogen and carbon which are found in the various kinds ot 
wood and coal. The oxjgen first combines with the car- 
bon and decomposes it, producing carbonic acid gas, which 
escapes into the air, from which it is absorbed b}' plants, or 
b}' human lungs when there is no proper ventilation. The 
ox3'gen also combines with the hj'drogen gas in the fuel, 
and this produces the flame ; the larger the amount of 
hydrogen in the fuel, the greater the amount of flame. 
Some of the products of combustion are not entirel}^ con- 
sumed, and pass off" as smoke ; some are incombustible, and 
remain as ashes. The intensity of a fire and the amount 
of heat which it produces are always in proportion to the 
amount of oxygen with which it is supplied. There should 
be just air enough for perfect combustion. An excess of 
air projected upon a fire conve3's awa}' the heat, cools the 
fuel, and checks the combustion. The suppl}' of air should 
be controlled b}' confining it in a limited space. 

Fires are usually kindled at the bottom of a flue or chim- 
ney. The heated air, being lighter, rises ; the colder, den- 
ser air rushes in to take its place, becomes heated, and 
ascends. Thus a continuous current is established, and a 
constant suppl}' of fresh air secured. The chimnc}' serves 
to Giwry off" the smoke and poisonous products of combus- 
tion ; the heavier, incombustible products settle in the form 
of ashes. The force of this current of air drawing through 
the chimney (a matter of great importance) is called the 
draught. It varies with the temperature and amount of 
air in the room, and the length and width of the chimney. 



Fuel. 

The materials generally used as fuel are wood, charcoal, 
coal, kerosene oil, and gas. 



Fuel. ' 5 

Sqfi laoods, such as pine or birch, kindle quickl}', produce 
intense heat, and are best for a quick, blazing fire. 

Hard ivoods , like oak, ash, and hickory, burn more slowly, 
but produce harder coals, which retain the heat longer, and 
are better where long-continued heat is required. 

Charcoal, which is coal made by charring or burning 
wood with only a limited supply of air, burns easily and 
produces greater heat in proportion to its weight than an}' 
other fuel. It should never be burned in a close room. 

Anthracite coal is a kind of mineral charcoal derived from 
ancient vegetation buried in the earth, and so thoroughly 
pressed that nothing is left but pure carbon, a little sul- 
phur, and the incombustible ash. It kindles slowl^', 3ields 
an intense, steady heat, and burns for a longer time with- 
out replenishing than the hardest wood. 

Coke, often used in cities, is the residue of coal from 
which illuminiiting gas has been manufactured. The heat 
is intense, but transient. 

Stoves for burning kerosene oil and gas have recently 
been introduced, and are now so nearl}' perfect that the 
care of a fire for cooking purposes is trifling. Gas can 
only be used in certain localities. 

The cheapest fuel is the best kerosene oil. There need 
be no waste, no superfluous heat, no vitiated air, if the fire 
be extinguished immediatel}' after the work is done, and if 
the stove be kept perfecth' clean, so as to secure a free 
burning and perfect combustion. With two good stoves 
having all the latest and best improvements, a large amount 
<of work can be easily and satisfactorilj' accomplished. 

The Making and Care of a Coal Fire. 

If 3'ou intend to bu}' a new stove or range, get one sim- 
ple in construction, that you may quickl}' learn all its parts 
and their uses ; plain in finish, that 3'ou ma}' easil}' keep it 
clean ; and perfectly fitted part to part, with doors and 
dampers shutting absoliitelv close, so that you may con- 
trol the fire and heat. This latter point is of essentia) 



The Boston Cook Book. 



importance in regulating the oven and in preventing a 
waste of fuel. 

Become thoroughl}' acquainted with whatever stove 3'ou 
ma}' have. If necessary-, take it apart ; learn how to 
clean it in the inside, to regulate the dampers for all the 
variations of wind, temperature, and fuel ; and then learc 
how to make and keep a fire. 

All stoves have a fire-box, with more or less space under* 
neath for ashes ; a slide damper under the fire, letting in 
the air ; an outlet for the smoke ; and a damper which reg- 
ulates the suppl}' of hot air, sending it around and under- 
neath the oven, or letting it escape into tlie chimnev. 
Remove the covers and brush the soot from the top of the 
oven into the fire-box ; then clean out the grate ; and if 
the stove have conveniences for so doing, sift the ashes in 
the stove and save all the old coal and cinders. Put in 
shavings or loose rolls of paper, then fine pine kindHngs, 
arranged crosswise, and a lajer of hard wood, leaving 
plenty of air space between the pieces. Be sure the wood 
comes out to each end of the fire-box. Put on the covers ; 
and if the stove need cleaning, moisten some pulverized 
stove polish with water, and rul) the stove with a paint 
brush dipped in the polish. When all blackened, rub with 
a dry polishing-brush until nearh' dr}'. Open the direct 
draught and oven damper, and light the paper, as a slight 
heat facilitates the process of polishing. When the wood 
is thoroughh' kindled, fill the fire-box with coal even with 
the top of the oven. Brush up the hearth and floor, empty 
the teakettle, and fill it witli fresh water. Watch the fire, 
and push the coal down as the wood burns away, and 
add enough more coal to keep it even with the top of the 
fire bricks. When the blue flame becomes white, close tlie 
oven damper ; and when the coal is burning freely, but not 
red, shut the direct draught. It seems impossible for some 
persons to understand that a coal fire is at its height as 
soon as well kindled, and needs only air enough to keep it 
burning. When it becomes bright red all through, it has 
parted with most of its heat, and begins to die out. Tons

of coal are wasted in many kitchens, and ranges are need- 
Iessl3' burned out, by filling the fire-box till the coal touches 
the covers, and leaving the draughts open till the coal is 
red. 

Nearly all stoves and portable ranges have the oven at 
one side of and a little below the fire. In brick-set ranges 
the ovens are sometimes over the fire. A stove has a door 
on each side of the oven, with the fire-box in front. A 
portable range has only one oven-door, and the fire-box at 
the end. In ranges where the oven is over the fire, the 
articles to be baked are placed on a grate near the middle, 
as the bottom of the oven is usually ver3' hot. In stoves 
or portable ranges an3'thing which has to rise in the oven, 
like bread, pastr}', cake, etc., is placed on the bottom of 
the oven, and, if the heat be too great, a small rack or 
grate may be placed under it. Large pieces of meat are 
placed on a rack in a pan ; while small cuts of meat, birds, 
etc., which are to be baked quickly, and any dishes which 
are to be merely- browned, like scalloped dishes, must be 
placed on the grate near the top. Cultivate the habit of 
opening and shutting the oven-door quickly but gently. 
Learn the hottest and coolest places in the oven. Look at 
things as the}' are baking, and turn and watch till you are 
sure the}' can be left alone. If anything bake unevenly or 
too fast, put a screen between it and the heat, — a pan on 
the grate above or underneath^ or a frame of stiff" paper 
made larger than the pan, that it may not touch the dough. 
When the regulating dampers are closed and the oven is 
still too hot, lift a cover on the top parti}' off*, although in 
a stove in which the parts are perfectly adjusted this will 
never be necessary. When the oven is not hot enough, 
open the direct draught, and rake out the ashes from the 
grate. Keep the grate cleaned out and the fire burning 
freely, when a very hot oven is needed. At other times 
keep the draughts shut and do not waste the coal. 

To keep a brisk fire for several hours or all day, it is 
better to add a sprinkling of coal often, rather than to let 
it burn nearly out, and then, by adding a larger quantity, 



The Boston Cook Booh 



check the fire and retard the work. In using the top of 
the stove remember the hottest place i^ over the fire and 
toward the middle, not on the front of the stove. When 
you have once watched the flame in its passage over the 
top, down the back, and under the oven, then across, out 
and up on the opposite side and out into the chimney', you 
will understand where the greatest heat must be. 



Boiling. 

The tenn " boiling" is often used erroneously in cook- 
erj'. The expressions '' the teakettle boils," '^ the rice is 
boiling," '' boiled beef," etc., are all good illustrations of 
the rhetorical figure metonymy^ but thev are practically 
incorrect. In all cases it is oul}' the water or liquid which 
boils. No solid can boil until first changed to a liquid. 
Solids become liquid at the melting-point. Liquids take 
the form of steam or vapor at'the boiling-point. Boiling 
is the conversion of a liquid into steam by the application 
of heat sufficient to cause ebullition^ or agitation of its sur- 
face. Boiling, therefore, as applied to the cooking of 
solids, is heating or cooking in a boiling liquid. It is one 
of the most generally used, and abused, forms of cooking. 
Boiling water, which is realh' cooked water, is the liquid 
usualh' emploj'ed. Water, as it is heated from below, ex- 
pands into vapor. The air of the water and the steam 
shoot up in the form of bubbles ; as they come in contact 
with the cold water near the surface, the bubbles collapse, 
the steam is condensed and descends with the cold water, 
making a double set of currents, which causes quite a com- 
motion among the particles. As the whole body of water 
becomes hotter, these bubbles of steam rise higher and 
higher before collapsing, and occasion the sound which 
we call the " singing of the kettle." When the water is 
suflficientlj' heated, they rise and break at the surface, 
causing more or less agitation, according to the rapidity 
with which the}' are formed. Water is scalding hot at 
150°, or when the hand cannot be borne in it. Water 



Boiling Wate7\ 9 



simmers when the bubbles all collapse beneath the surface, 
and the steam is condensed to water again, or at 185°.. 
Water boils when the bubbles rise to the surface, and the 
steam is thrown off, as at 212°. When this boiling-point 
is reached, the heat escapes with the steam ; and all the fire 
in the world cannot make the water any hotter, so long as 
the steam escapes. If the fire be very fierce, so that these 
bubbles are formed and expelled rapidly, and the water 
boils over, the water is no hotter ; it only evaporates or 
boils awa3' faster, and can only be made hotter by confin- 
ing the steam, which in ordinary kettles is impossible, 
owing to the enormous expansive force of the steam. 
With a few exceptions it is a waste of fuel, time, and ma- 
terial to keep the water boiling at such a galloping rate 
that the cover has to be lifted to prevent boiling over. 

A kettle should never be quite full, as the water ex- 
pands in heating, and, in boiling over, makes needless 
work and injures the stove. Water will boil more quickly 
in a kettle with a rough surface than in one with a smooth 
surface, as the water adheres to a smooth surface with 
greater force, and this force or attraction must be over- 
come before boiling takes place. Small, clean gravel is 
sometimes kept in a smooth kettle to facilitate the boihng. 

Water boils at a higher temperature when there is sugar, 
or salt, or anything in it to increase its density. It takes 
longer for it to boil ; but it is hotter, when that point is 
reached. No one who has been burned b}' boiling syrup 
ever doubted this fact. Fresh water boils at 212°; salt 
water, at 224°. If we put salt with the water in the lower 
part of a double boiler, a greater degree of heat is obtained 
bj' which to cook the articles in the top. 

Water boils at a lower temperature, that is, more quickl}^ 
when the pressure of the air upon the water is diminished. 
Before a rain the pressure of the air is lessened, because 
the air when filled with vapor is lighter. Observing house- 
keepers have often noticed how quickly things burn at such 
a time, and foretell a rain b}' the rapidity with which water 
evaporates. 



lo The Boston Cook Booh. 

The pressure of the ah* is less the higher we ascend 
above the level of the sea, since we leave much of the air 
below us. Cooking in boiling water requires a much 
longer time in mountainous regions ; for the water boils so 
quick!}' that it holds less heat than in lower altitudes, 
where it is subject to greater pressure. Water, in boiling, 
loses the air or gases which give it a fresh taste and spark- 
ling appearance. It becomes flat and tasteless. If there 
be an}' impurit}' in water, boiling or cooking will destro}^ 
it. Then, by cooling, and exposing to pure air again, it 
becomes aerated and palatable. But water for cooking, 
unless there are impurities to be removed, should be used 
when freshly boiled. This is especiall}' important in mak- 
ing tea and coffee. 

Soft water should be used in boihng where the object is 
to soften the texture, and extract the soluble parts, as in 
soups, broths, tea, and coffee. Hard water, or soft water 
salted, is better where we wish to preserve the articles 
whole, and retain the soluble and flavoring principles, as in 
most green A'egetables. Beans or dried peas, which contain 
casein or vegetable albumen in large proportion, should be 
cooked in soft water, as the lime in hard water hardens the 
casein, and prevents the vegetables from becoming soft. 

In cooking meat, fish, and vegetables in water, we should 
remember these two facts : — 

Gold water draws out the albuminous juices, softens the 
fibres and gelatinous portions of meat, and holds them in 
solution. It draws out starch, but does not unite with it. 

Boiling water hardens and toughens albumen and fibrine, 
bursts the starch grains, and is absorbed by the swelling 
5tarch. 

Meat is cooked in water for three distinct purposes : — 

First. To keep the nutriment within the meat., as in 
what is usually called boiled meat. To do this, we leave the 
meat whole, that only a little surface may be exposed. 
Plunge it into boiling salted water, and keep it there for 
five or ten minutes ; this hardens the albumen over the 
entire surface, and makes a coating through which the juices 



Boiling Meat., etc. ii 

cannot escape. Then move the kettle where the water 
will simmer slowlj' . See that the cover fits tightl}', to keep 
in the steam. The water should be salted to raise the 
boiling-point, and increase the densit}' of the water, and 
thus prevent the escape of the juices. A small amount of 
the albumen in the outer surface will be dissolved and rise 
as scum. This should be removed, or it will settle on the 
meat and render it uninviting in appearance. If the meat 
be put in the kettle with the bones uppermost, then the scum 
will not settle on the meat. In turning the meat do not 
pierce into it to let the juices escape. It will take a longer 
time to cook in this wa}^ but the fibrine will be softened, 
and the meat made more tender and of better flavor, than 
when kept boiling furiousl3\ 

Second. Meats are cooked in water to have the nutri- 
ment ivholly in the liquid^ as in soups and meat teas. Cut 
the meat in small pieces ; soak in cold water, the longer 
the better ; heat graduall}', and keep hot, but not boiling, 
until all the goodness is extracted. 

Third. Meats are cooked in water to have the nutri- 
ment partly in the liquid and partly in the meat., as in steivs.^ 
fricassees^ etc. Put the meat in cold water, let the water 
boil quickl}', then skim, and keep at the simmering-point. 
The cold water will draw out enough of the juices to enrich 
the liquid ; then, as it reaches the boiling-point, the meat 
hardens, and retains the remainder. 

Fish is usuall}' cooked in boiling water for the purpose 
of keeping the juices in the fish. As the flesh of fish 
breaks easil}', the water should never be allowed to boil 
rapidl3^ Salmon, mackerel, or an}' ver}' oil}' fish, should 
be put into cold water, and brought almost to the boiling- 
point quickly, as they have a very strong, rich flavor. A 
little of this flavor can be lost without injury to the fish. 

Vegetables, which are mostly starch and water, should 
be put into boiling water and boiled rapidly, that the small 
portions of albumen which they contain may be hardened 
on the surface ; then, if the starch grains are burst quickly, 
they will absorb the albuminous juices within. 



12 The Boston Cook Book. 

Milk boils at 196°. Being thicker than water, less of 
the steam escapes, and the whole liquid becomes hot sooner 
than water. The bubbles rise rapidl}^, and, owing to their 
tenacity, do not burst at the surface, but climb over one 
another till the}^ run over the edge of the pan. 

Milk, grains, custards, and an}^ substances which, from 
their glutinous nature, would be liable to adhere to the 
kettle, are much more easily- and safely cooked in a double 
boiler, or in a pail within a kettle of water. This is one 
form of steaming, or cooking over boiling water. In steam- 
ing, the water should not stop boiling until the articles are 
cooked. This is a convenient form of cooking many arti- 
cles which it is troublesome to cook with a dry heat, and 
yet do not need the solvent powers of water. Watery 
vegetables are rendered drier by steaming ; and tough 
pieces of meat which cannot be roasted, are first made 
tender b}^ steaming, and then browned in the oven. Some- 
times meat is steamed in its own juices alone ; this is 
called smothering, or pot-roasting. 

Stewing is another form of boiling or cooking in a small 
qnantit}^ of water, at a moderate heat, and for a long time. 
The word means a slow, moist, gentle heat. It is an eco- 
nomical mode of cooking, except where a fire has to be 
kept for this purpose alone. The long-continued action of 
a gentle heat softens the fibres ; and the coarsest and 
cheapest kinds of meat, cooked in this wa}', with vegeta- 
bles, ma}^ be made tender and nutritious. B3' judicious use 
of seasoning material, remnants can be made into savory 
and nourishing dishes. Whether we call it simply a stew, 
or ragout^ haricot, or salmi, the principle is the same, — 
that o^ slow, steady simmering, rather than fierce boiling. 

Fricasseeing (meaning "to fry") is a form of stewing. 
The term is usually applied to chicken, veal, or some small 
game, which is cut into pieces, and fried either before or 
after stewing, and served with a rich white or brown 
sauce, and without vegetables. Any meat that is quite 
juic}' and not very tough may be first browned on the out- 
side to keep in the juices, and improve the flavor. Coarse, 



Braising^ Baking, 13 

tough pieces should not be browned, but dipped in vinegar 
to soften the fibre ; and pieces containing much gristle 
should be put into cold water. 

Braising is a form of steAving done usually in a braising- 
pan or kettle which has coals in the cover. Any granite 
or iron pan with a close cover to keep in the steam will 
answer the purpose. When placed in the oven, where it 
is surrounded b}* a slow, uniform heat, it needs \Qvy little 
attention. It is one of the most economical and satisfac- 
tory ways of cooking large pieces of tough, lean meat, 
pigeons, liver, fowls, heart, etc. Stock, vegetables, and 
bacon may be used, if a rich liquor be required ; but water, 
herbs, and simple seasoning make it ver}- palatable. 

Baking is hardening or cooking in a dry heat, as in a 
close oven. Nearly all flour mixtures — bread, pastry, and 
some forms of pudding — are more wholesome baked than 
when cooked in any other wa}'. Manj- forms of baking 
are really stewing ; but the closely confined heat of the 
oven gives an entirely different flavor from that obtained 
by stewing over the fire. This is seen in the difference 
between stewed and baked apple-sauce, beans, etc. 

Meat and fish, if baked in the right waj-, lose less in 
weight than when boiled or roasted. To bake them prop- 
erly, the juices must be kept within the meat. An intense 
heat at first is necessary to harden the albumen ; then re- 
duce the heat, that the outside may not become too hard, 
and baste frequently to prevent drying. No water should 
be put in the pan at first, as it will then be impossible to 
have a greater heat than that of boiling water (212°) , while 
for baking meat 280'', or more, is required. Put one or 
two table spoonfuls of beef drippings, or some of the fat 
from the meat, in the pan, to use in basting, as the fat can 
be made much hotter than water. If the joint be very 
large, or the meat need thorough cooking, hke poultry, 
veal, or pork, water can be added to check the heat as 
soon as the outside is cooked sufficiently to keep in the 
juices. This will keep the meat moist. Small cuts, and 
meats to be eaten rare, are better baked without water. 



14 The Boston Cook Booh 

Many persons accustomed to meat roasted before the 
open fire object to the flavor of baked meat. If the oven 
be ver^^ hot at first, and opened every five minutes just 
long enough for tlie basting, which is an essential part of 
the cooking process, the smoky odor escapes. If there 
be no damper to clieck the heat underneath the oven, put 
the grate or another pan under the dripping-pan, as no 
heat is required under the meat. This will prevent the fat 
in the pan from burning and smoking the meat. Place 
the meat with the skin side down at first ; then, if the 
juices begin to flow, the skin keeps them in ; and, when 
turned, it brings the side which is to be up in serving 
next the hottest part of the oven, for the final browning. 
All baked meat or fish should be salted and floured all 
over. Salt draws out the juices ; but the flour unites with 
them, making a paste which soon hardens, and keeps them 
within. Baste often, and dredge with salt and flour after 
basting. If there be no shelf attached to the stove near 
the oven, keep a box or frame of wood just the height of 
the oven, near by, and pushed up close to it; it will be 
found very convenient to pull the pan out upon it when 
basting or turning the meat. 

Frying. 

Frjdng is cooking in hot fat, — 7iot boiling fat, as it is so 
often called, for fat can be made much hotter than the 
temperature required for cooking, which is 385° ; the tem- 
perature for boiling fat is from 565° to 600°. Frying, 
when properly done, is immersion in smoking-hot fat. The 
fat should be deep enough to entirely cover the articles to 
be cooked ; and as it may be used many times, it is not so 
extravagant as some suppose to use such a quantit3^ The 
prime secret of nice frying is to have the fat hot enough 
to harden instantl)^ the albumen on the outer surface, and 
thus prevent the fat from soaking into the inside of what- 
ever is to be fried. As a much higher temperature is 
required than that for boiling or baking, the articles are 



Frying. 1 5 



very quicklj' cooked ; and the}' have a flavor quite unUke 
that given by any other form of cooking. 

All articles to be fried should be thoroughly dried and 
slightly warmed. If very moist., or very cold, or too many 
articles be fried at a time, the fat becomes chilled, and 
the grease soaks into them. Then, as the moisture heats 
and boils, it causes such a commotion that the fat and 
water boil over, and there is great danger from the fat 
taking fire and spreading to 30ur clothing, to say nothing 
of the trouble of cleaning the stove and floor. For this 
reason be careful not to let a drop of water, or of con- 
densed steam from another kettle, fall into the hot fat. 

Meat, fish, oysters, croquettes, etc., should be dried, 
and rolled in fine bread-crumbs, to absorb any moisture ; 
then rolled in beaten Qg^, and in fine crumbs again. The 
hot fat hardens the albumen of the Qgg instantly ; and that, 
with the crumbs, makes a fat-proof crust. 

Fish balls, fritters, and fried muffin mixtures contain 
egg and albumen sufficient to keep them from soaking fat, 
if the fat be onl}' hot enough. A Scotch bowl, or deep 
iron or granite kettle, and a wire basket small enough to 
fit down into the kettle, are best to use in ftying. 

The Test for Hot Fat. — When the fat begin? to smoke 
put in a bit of bread ; if it brown quickh', or while you 
can count sixty as the clock ticks, it is hot enough for 
fried potatoes, doughnuts, etc. "When hot enough to 
brown the bread while you count forty, it will do for fish 
balls, croquettes, etc. 

When ready to fry, plunge the basket into the hot fat 
to grease it, and then place in it the croquettes, or what- 
ever you may be frying, so that they will not touch each 
other. Hold the handle of the basket with a long fork, 
and plunge it quickly into the fat, but do not drop the 
handle, because if the fat begin to boil up, you can then 
raise the basket quickly, and wait till the ebullition has 
subsided before plunging it in again ; and thus avoid 
the danger of burning from the overflowing fat. The fat 
cools rapidljs when many articles are fried at once, and 



i6 The Boston Cook Booh 

should be reheated to the test point before fiying an}' 
more. 

Tirne. — An}^ cooked mixture, such as fish balls and cro- 
quettes, or very small fish, 03'sters, scallops, etc., will be 
fried brown in one minute. Thicker fish, chops, and frit- 
ters require longer cooking ; and, after plunging them into 
the hot fat, the kettle should be set back from the fire to 
prevent them from becoming too brown before the}' are 
sufficientl}' cooked, ^yhile ftjing, be careful not to spill 
any fat on the stove. Keep a tin plate in your left hand, 
and hold it under the basket, or ladle, as you take things 
from the fat. 

Draining. — Thorough draining is another secret of nice 
frying, and you cannot find a much hotter place than right 
over tlie hot fat ; so hold your basket of fried food over the 
hot fat, and shake slightly, till all dripping has stopped. 
Then place the fried articles on soft or ungiazed paper, to 
absorb the fat, and keep them hot till read}' to serve. 
Never pile fried articles one on another. 

Fat for Frying. 

Lard, a mixture of half suet and half lard, drippings, or 
oil, may be used for frying. Suet and drippings are cheap- 
est, and are preferred by many. vSuet used alone cools 
very quickly and leaves a tallowy taste. Drippings should 
be carefully clarified (see page 18) and freed from water, 
or the articles cooked will soak fat. Lard, with a small 
proportion of suet or drippings, is more generally satisfac- 
tory. There is often a very disagreeable odor to new lard, 
and more or less water in it, as is shown by the froth and 
ebullition as soon as it becomes hot. Before it is used for 
any purpose it should be clarified with slices of raw potato 
and heated until it becomes still. Olive oil is the purest fat 
for frying, but it is too expensive for general use. Cotton- 
seed oil has been recently introduced for cooking purposes, 
and is an excellent fat for frying, though many dislike its 
peculiar odor It may be heated much hotter than lardj 



SauUing, 1 7 



without burning, and, when properly used, imparts do 
flavor to the food. When the fat becomes too brown lor 
potatoes or doughnuts, use it for croquettes, etc., and then 
use it for nothing except fish balls and fish. When it be- 
comes \Qvy brown, put it with the soap-grease. 

If 3'ou wish to fv\ several kinds at the same time, begin 
with potatoes, following with doughnuts or flour mixtures, 
and crumbed articles last ; otherwise the crumbs will fall 
off", and adhere to whatever is put in subsequently. After 
ever}^ fiying, strain the fat through a fine wire strainer or 
fine strainer cloth into a tin pail, not pouring it, but dip- 
ping it from the kettle with a small long-handled dipper. 
Let it cool slightly before straining, as, if ver}- hot, it will 
melt the strainer. Sprinkle coff'ee on the stove, while fry- 
ing, to disguise the odor. 

Sauteing. 

The ordinar}^ wa}^ of fiying in a shallow pan with onl}^ a 
little fat, first on one side and then on the other, which the 
French call sauteing^ answers verj' well for some purposes, 
— omelets, fried cakes, and man}' things browned in butter ; 
but nearly ever\'thing that requires any more fat than just 
enough to keep it from sticking, is much better immersed 
in hot fat. Fish balls, chops, and 03'sters are more quickly 
cooked, and absorb less fat, when fried by immersion than 
when sauted. Some people are extremely unwilling to 
make the change, and persist in going on in the old wa}' 
of cooking in a Httle, half-hot fat which spatters over 
stove and floor, soaks into the fish or meat, and is often 
served as the onl}' grav}-. Upon such, dyspepsia is a fell 
avenger. 

These directions for frying are given thus minutety not 
from any desire to recommend this method of cooking ; 
but, if people will fry their food, they should do it in the 
only correct wa3\ With the exception of salt-fish balls 
and small, dry, white fish, there is nothing fried, even in 

2 



r8 The Boston Cook Book, 

the right wa}-, that would not be equall}- good, and much 
more conducive to health, were it cooked otherwise. Sar- 
atoga potatoes, or chips as the}- are called, are really chips, 
for persons with weak digestion. Ojsters, chops, fritters, 
and the materials in croquettes, muffins, and doughnuts 
may be cooked in manj' better ways. 

Frying answers very well for open-air cooking, on the 
seashore or in camp, where appetite and digestion are 
strengthened. But in most modern houses, where the 
odors from the kitchen penetrate the remotest nook and 
corner, there are many serious objections, apart from the 
indigestibility of the food thus prepared. The acrid odors 
given off during the heating of fat are ver}' irritating to 
the mucous membrane of the nose and throat, and they are 
equally so to a sensitive stomach. Some persons who can 
usuallj^ digest fried food cannot do so when the stomach 
has been irritated by the odor in ftying. If all those who 
are so fond of croquettes, fritters, etc., were obliged to 
inhale the smoking fat, these dishes would seldom appear 
on the table. 

To clarify Fat. 

An}' uncooked fat, such as suet, the fat from chickens, 
and all superfluous beef fat, should be saved and clarified, 
or made pure and clear. Cut the fat into small pieces, 
cover with cold water, and cook over a slow fire until the 
fat has melted, and the water nearl}' all evaporated. Then 
strain and press all the fat from the scraps. When cool, 
remove the cake of hard fat, or, if soft, draw it to one side 
and let the water underneath run off. You may put with 
the new fat anj^ fat from soup stock, corned beef, drippings 
from roast beef, veal, fresh pork, or chicken ; in fact, any- 
thing except the fat from mutton, turke}', and smoked 
meat. If there be an}- sediment adhering to the fat, add 
a little very cold water, and, after stirring well, pour the 
water off, or skim the fat from the water. Place the fat 
in a pan over the fire, and, when melted, add one small 
raw potato, cut into thin slices. Let it stand on the top 



Egg and Bread Critmhing. *\g 

of the stove or in the oven till the fat has stopped bub- 
bling, is still, and the scraps are brown and crisp and 
rise to the top. Strain through a fine strainer, and keep 
in a cool place. Fat thus cleared will keep sw^eet for 
w'eeks, if melted occasionally, which should always be 
done when any new fat is added. 

Boiling the fat causes the water in it to evaporate, and 
the organic matters or impurities to be decomposed, and 
deposited as sediment ; the potato, owing to its porosity 
and power of absorption (being mostly starch and car- 
bon), absorbs any odors or gases, collects the sediment, 
and thus cleanses the fat, very much as charcoal purifies 
water. Clarified fat (or dripping, as it is usually termed) 
answers for many purposes in cooking, — frying, saute- 
ing, basting roast meat, greasing pans ; and as shorten- 
ing for bread, plain pastry, and gingerbread. 

Egg and Bread Crumbing. 

Hints on saving bread crusts and stale pieces, for Qg^ 
and bread crumbing, are given on page 75. The crumbs 
should be sifted through a fine sieve. For fish or meat 
mix a little salt, pepper, and chopped parsle}' with them. 
Beat the eggs slightl}^ with a fork in a shallow dish. Add 
one tablespoonful of water or two tablespoonfuls of milk 
for each eg^. Add a little sugar if the}' are to be used for 
sweet dishes, and salt and pepper for all others. Sprinkle 
the crumbs on a board, and roll the chop, fish, or cro- 
quettes first in the crumbs ; shake off all that do not adhere. 
Cover all the articles with the crumbs and let them stand 
till drj', then dip into the beaten egg, and be careful to 
have every part covered. Drain from the egg, and roll 
again in the crumbs. Croquettes or any soft mixture 
should be held on a broad knife while being placed in the 
egg. Then dip the egg over them, and slip the knife again 
lengthwise under the croquette, drain, and put it carefully 
into the crumbs. Scallops and ver}' small 03'sters can be 
more easily crumbed by placing them with the crumbs in a 



20 The Boston Cook Book. 

sheet of paper, and tossing or turning till all are crumbed . 
Remember the order : crumbs first, then egg, then crumbs 



Roasting. 

Roasting (meaning " to heat violentl}^" ) is cooking be- 
fore an open fire ; it implies the action of a much greater 
degree of heat than that employed in an}' of the previously 
specified methods of cooking. The heat of an open fire is 
about 1,000°. 

In the days of open fireplaces this was the general way 
of cooking large pieces of meat ; but now it is adopted 
onl}' in large establishments, or b}' those who can afford 
the additional expense of a tin kitchen, and a range con- 
structed especially for roasting. Baking, or roasting in a 
very hot oven, being a cheaper and more convenient wa}^, 
is more generally used. Ovens in stoves and ranges are 
now well ventilated ; and meat when properly cooked in a 
ver}' hot oven, and basted often, is nearl}' equal in flavor 
to that roasted before an open fire. The fire for roasting 
should be clear and bright, and of sufficient body to last, 
with onl}' a slight sprinkling of coal, through the time for 
roasting. 

The meat is placed on a spit, and hung in the jack in a 
tin kitchen, and made to revolve slowly before the fire b}' 
winding a spring in the jack, or by turning the spit at 
regular intervals. The meat should be rubbed with salt 
and fiour, and placed on the spit, ver}' near the fire at 
first, to harden the albumen ; then removed a little dis- 
tance to prevent the meat from burning, before the inside 
is cooked. Place two or three spoonfuls of dripping in 
the pan to use in basting the meat ; baste often, and 
dredge two or three times with fiour. When the joint is 
very large, place a buttered paper over it. 

As the juices of meat are composed largely of water, 
the water will be evaporated as soon as it reaches the 
boiling-point, or 212°. When meat is placed in a moder- 
ate oven, the heat is not sufficient to harden the albumen 



Broiling. 2 1 



on the outer surface ; the water}^ juices evaporate, the 
steam escapes, and the meat becomes (\y\ and tasteless. 
But when meat is exposed to the intense heat of an open 
fire, or a \qv\ hot oven, the albumen hardens ; and if 
basted frequentlj' with hot fat, the meat is completely en- 
veloped in a varnish of hot melted fat, which assists in 
communicating the heat to the inside, and checks the 
evaporation of the juices ; this prevents the escape of the 
steam, so that the inside of properly- roasted meat is 
really cooked in the steam of its own juices. The evapo 
ration of juices is proportionate to the amount of surface 
exposed. A small joint has a larger surface in proportion 
to its weight than a large joint weighing double or treble 
the amount ; therefore the smaller the joint to be roasted, 
the higher the temperature to which its surface should be ex- 
posed, that the evaporation may be more quickl3^ arrested. 
For very thin pieces of meat, which have a still larger 
surface in proportion to the weight, such as steaks and 
chops, a greater heat is required. This is accomplished 
by broiling^ wdiich should be done near the burning- 
point, the highest degree of heat emplo3'ed in any form of 
cooking. 

Broiling. 

Broiling (meaning " to burn " ) is cooking directly over 
the hot coals. The degree of heat is so intense that the 
articles to be cooked would be very quickb' burned, w^ere 
they allowed to remain for any length of time over the fire. 
The secret of nice broiling is frequent turning. The fire 
should be bright red, and nearly to the top of the fire-box, 
so that the broiler ma}' almost touch the fire. There 
should be no flame, as the flame from coal is due to the 
combustion of tarr}" vapors, and will cause a deposit of 
coal tar on the meat, giving it a smoky, nauseating flaA'or. 
When the fat from the chop or steak drips on the coals 
and blazes, it deposits a film of mutton or beef fat all 
over the meat, which has a very diflferent flavor from that 
of the coal flame. When the steak has much fat, remove 



22 The Boston Cook Booh 

part of it. A little fat will improve the flaA^or, baste 
the meat, and keep it from becoming too dry. The 
oven damper should always be opened while broihng, 
that the smoke of the dripping fat may be carried into the 
chimney. 

There is nothing better for broiling than a double wire 
broiler. It is well to have several sizes. Grease it well 
with a bit of the fat from the meat, or with salt-pork rind. 
Place the thickest part of whatever is to be broiled next 
the middle of the broiler. Do not salt the meat, as salt 
draws out the juice. Have the platter heating, and every- 
thing else ready, that you may not leave the broihng for 
an instant. Hold the broiler firmly, with a coarse towel 
wrapped around 3'our hand to protect it from the heat. 
Place it as near the fire as possible, to sear the outside 
instantly ; count ten, then sear the other side. The heat 
hardens the outside, and starts the flow of the juices. 
They cannot escape through the hardened outer surface ; 
but if the meat were cooked wholl}^ on one side before 
turning, thc}^ would soon come to the top, and then, in 
turning the meat, the juices would drip into the fire. But 
if the meat be turned before the juices reach the top, the 
other surface is hardened, and the^^ cannot escape, but flow 
to the centre, and are there retained. As the juices are 
converted into steam b}' the heat, they swell and give the 
meat a puffj^ appearance. If the broiling be carried on 
too long, these juices gradually ooze between the fibres 
to the surface, and are evaporated ; and the meat becomes 
dry, leather}', and indigestible. 

Meat should be broiled only long enough to loosen all 
the fibres, and start the flow of the juices. The meat will 
spring up instantly when pressed with the knife ; and when 
it ceases to do this, the juices have begun to evaporate, 
and the meat shrinks. A little experience will enable one 
to decide just when to remove the meat. Do not cut into 
it, as this lets out the juices. It should be pink and juicy, 
not raw and purple, nor brown and dr}'. Turn over as 
often as you can count ten, and cook four minutes, if 



Broiling. 23 



one inch thick; six, if one inch and a half thick. The 
smaller and thinner the article, the hotter should be the 
fire ; the larger the article, the more temperate the fire, 
or the greater the distance from the fire. 

Fish should be floured to keep the skin from sticking. 
A large baking-pan to keep in the heat should be laid 
over the fish if thick, or it may be first partly cooked in 
the oven. 

Chickens, to be thoroughly broiled but not burned or 
dried, require about twenty minutes. A safe way is to 
wrap them in buttered glazed paper ; cook the inner side 
first, and after the first searing keep them farther from 
the fire, or cook them first in the oven. 

Chops, bacon, birds, and dry fish are also improved by 
broiling in the buttered paper. Take a large sheet of 
white letter paper, or two small sheets. Rub them well 
with softened butter. This keeps out the air. Season the 
chop or fish with salt and pepper, place it near the centre 
of the paper, and fold the edges of the paper over several 
times and pinch them together close to the meat. The 
paper will char a long time before blazing, if care be taken 
not to break through the paper and thus let in the air and 
let out all the fat. The meat will be basted with its own 
fat and juices. A longer time will be required for the 
broiling ; but when the paper is well browned, the chop will 
be done. It will be found juic}' and delicious, — ■ free 
from an}' smok}' flavor. 

Pan-hroiling is broiling in a hissing hot spider or frjing- 
pan. Heat the pan to a blue heat. Rub it with a bit of 
the beef fat, just enough to keep the meat from sticking, 
but do not leave an}' fat in the pan. Sear the meat quickly 
on one side, then turn without cutting into the meat, and 
brown the other side before any juice escapes into the 
pan. Cook about four minutes, turning twice, and serve 
very hot with salt and butter. If the pan be hot enough 
and no fat used, this is not frying, it is hroiling on hot 
iron', and the flavor is almost equal to broiling over the 
ocals.

Larding. 

Man}' kinds of meat which are ver\' lean and dry are 
improved b}' the addition of some kind of fat. The tender- 
loin or fillet of beef, the thick part of the leg of veal, grouse, 
and liver, are often prepared in this waj'. 

Larding is drawing small strips of fat salt pork or bacon 
through the surface of the meat ; daubing is forcing strips 
of pork through the entire thickness of the meat. Take a 
piece of fat salt pork two inches wide and fom' inches 
long. Shave oil' the rind the long way of the pork ; then 
cut two or three slices about a quarter of an inch thick, 
the same way as the rind ; cut only to the membrane which 
lies about an inch below the rind, as this is the firmest 
part of the pork ; then cut each slice across the width, into 
strips one quarter of an inch thick. This will make the 
lardoons one quarter of an inch wide and thick and two 
inches long. Insert one end of the lardoon into the end 
of the larding-needle, then with the point of the needle 
take up a stitch half an inch deep and one inch wide in 
the surface of the meat. Draw the needle through, and 
help the pork to go through b}' pushing until parti}' through, 
then hold the end of the pork and draw the needle out, 
leaving the pork in the meat, with the ends projecting 
at equal lengths Take up more stitches one inch apart 
in parallel or alternate rows, until the whole surface is 
covered. 

Daubing is applied to a broad, thick piece of beef or 
veal. Cut the pork in strips one third of an inch wide and 
thick, and as long as the meat is thick. Punch a hole 
clear through the meat with a steel, and then insert the 



26 The Boston Cook Book, 

lardoon with a large larding-needle or with the fingers. 
The salt and fat from the lardooiis penetrate the inside of 
the meat, and by man}' are considered an improvement. 
Those who object to the pork will find that beef may be 
seasoned as well by covering the surface with nice beef 
suet, salted ; or the pork ma^' be laid on the meat and 
removed after cooking. The process is not difficult, re- 
quiring no more skill than any other kind of sewing. 

Boning. 

An}' one who can use a sharp knife, and scrape meat or 
fish from a bone, without cutting her own flesh, can bone 
anj'thing, from the smallest bird, chop, or fish, to a leg or 
forequarter of lamb, or a turkey. A small knife with a 
sharp, short, pointed blado, is all that is required. It is 
well to begin on a small scale l)y removing the bone from 
a chop or steak. The aim is to remove the iiesh from the 
bone without cutting into the flesh, or destro3ing its shape 
more than is necessary. 

To Bone a Chop or Steak. — Begin at the bone end, scrape 
the meat awa}', leaving the bone clean and the flesh un- 
broken. If there, be a piece of tenderloin under the bone, 
remove it, and put it up close to the meat, which was 
above the bone in the original form. 

Directions for boning fish are given on page 161. 

To Bone a Leg of Mutton. — Cut it oflT at the first joint, 
insert the knife near the joint, and loosen the flesh from 
the bone, leaving all the gristle and tendons on the bone. 
Then begin at the tail end, and scrape the fat away from 
the backbone, then follow the bone (you can easily tell by 
the feeling, if you cannot see it) until 3'ou come to the 
joint ; leave all the gristle and cords on the bone, and con- 
tinue scraping oflf the flesh till the whole bone is out. One 
could easil}' cut through from the outside to the bone and 
remove it in that wa}' ; but the flesh would have to be 
sewed together, and much of the juice would escape. 
After removing the bone, stuflf the cavity left by the bone, 



Boning. 27 



and sew the skin together at the smaller end. Then bring 
the edges together at the upper end, crowding ail the flesh 
inside, and sew the skin together tightly. This gives a 
rectangular form of solid meat and stuffing. When salted 
and floured and exposed to a hot oven, the juices are kept 
inside ; the meat is more conveniently served, and, when 
cold, does not become dr\' and hard. 

An}' other pieces of meat are boned in a similar manner. 

To Bone a Bird, Fowl, or Turkey. — In this case the 
flesh is to be kept in the skin in order to preserve the 
shape. The skin should be firm and unbroken, and 
the bird should not be di'awn. Remove the head and pin- 
feathers, singe and wipe carefullj-. Remove the tendons 
from the legs, and loosen the skin round the end of the 
drumstick. Make an incision through the skin from the 
neck to the middle of the back, or near the junction of 
the side bone. Scrape the flesh with the skin away from 
the backbone until you feel the end of the shoulder-blade ; 
loosen the flesh from this, and then follow the bone to the 
wing joint, and down to the middle joint in the wing. 
Tile skin lies very near the l)one underneath the joint, 
and care must be taken to avoid cutting through the skin 
at these places. Leave the first bone in the wing to aid 
in keeping the shape ; it ma}' be removed before serving. 
In small birds there is so little meat on the wings, that 
it is just as well to cut them otf at the middle joint. Re- 
move the bone from the other wing in the same wa}', then 
follow the collar bone from the wing down to the breast- 
bone, loosening the crop from the flesh. In removing the 
flesh from the breastbone, be careful not to cut through 
the skin on the ridge. The flesh may be pushed awa}' 
with the fingers, and the fillets or pieces that are detached 
from the other flesh can be laid aside, and put in place 
afterwards. "When the breastbone is bare, separate the 
flesh from the ribs, and be careful not to break through 
the membrane into the inside. Remove the flesh round 
the second joint, then the drumsticks, turning the flesh 
wrong side out as in pulling a glove from the finger. 



28 The Boston Cook Book, 

Repeat this process on the other side. Then scrape down 
to the end of the backbone, and cut through the bone, 
leaving a part of it in the tail. Separate the membrane 
under the body without breaking. Thus you have the 
flesh in the skin, and the skeleton left entire with the con- 
tents undisturbed in the inside. Lay the stuffing in, filling 
out the legs and wings, then sew the skin along the back, 
and skewer or tie into the original shape. 

An easier way of boning a fowl where it is to be rolled 
like a galantine^ is to cut off" the wings at the second joint, 
break the drumstick half-wa}' from the joint, cut the skin 
down the entire length of the back, remove the flesh from 
the wing and second joint, turning the skin and flesh off 
like a glove ; then do the same on the other wing and leg, 
leaAdng the breast till the last. The wings and legs are 
turned inside, the stuffing is laid in the flesh, and the 
whole rolled over and over, and sewed on the edge of the 
skin and at the ends of the roll. 

Measuring. 

It has been said that '' good cooks never measure an}'- 
thing." The}' do. They measure by judgment and ex- 
perience ; and until you have a large share of both these 
essential qualities, use your spoon and cup or scales. 

Measures, in preference to weights, are used in nearl}^ 
all these receipts, as they are more convenient for the ma- 
jority of housekeepers. Wlien measured and estimated by 
tlie Table of Weights and JMeasures on page 30, the cup 
and spoon may be used as accurately' as the scales. 

Flour, meal, sugar, salt, spices, and soda should al- 
wa3'S be sifted before measuring. Any other materials 
that have been packed, like mustard and baking powder, 
if not sifted, should be stirred, and broken up lightly. 
One tablespoonful of solid mustard taken carelessly from 
the box has been found equal to three tablespoonfuls 
measured after sifting. 

The saltspoons, teaspoons, and tablespoons used in these 
receipts are the silver spoons now in general use. Iron 



Measuring, 29 



mixiiig-spoous vary much iu size, but there is a size 
wliicli holds exactly the same as a silver tablespoon. Be 
careful to use this size iu measuring. The cup is the 
common kitchen cup holding half a pint. Those with 
handles are more convenient. 

To measure a rounded teaspoonful of dry material, dip 
into the sifted material, and take up a heaping spoonful, 
shake it slightly until it is just rounded over, or convex 
in the same proportion as the spoon is concave. A level 
teas2Wonful means the spoon filled lightly, and levelled off 
with a knife. Oyie half teaspoonful is most accuratelj- 
measured by dividing through the middle lengthwise. 
When divided across the width the tip is smaller than the 
lower half. A heaping teaspoonful is all the spoon will 
hold of any lightly sifted material. A teaspoonful of liquid 
is the spoon full to the brim. 

Tahlespoonfuls are measured in the same way. 

A cupful of dr}^ material should be filled and heaped 
lightly (not shaken down), then levelled oflT even with the 
top. A small scoop should be kept in the flour or sugar 
to use in filling the cup. A heaping cupful is all the cup will 
hold. A cupful of liquid is not what 3'ou can carry without 
spilUng, but what the cup will hold without running over ; 
full to the brim. Place 3'our cup in a saucer, while filling 
it, or in the bowl in which the liquid is to be poured. 
Half a cupful is not half the distance from the bottom to 
the rim. Most cups are smaller at the bottom, for which 
allowance must be made. Take two cups of the same 
size and shape, fill one with water, then pour the water 
without spilling into the other cup until it stands at the 
same level in both cups. This gives 3^ou the half-cupful 
exacth', which in the cups used here is two thirds of the 
height, or within an inch of the top. The quarter and 
three-quarter measures maj' be found in the same way. A 
scant cupfd is within a quarter of an inch of the top. 

'•'Butter the size of an egg^' is a very common expression. 
This equals about one quarter of a cupful, or two ounces, 
or one heaping tablespoonful, either of which is more easily 



30 The Boston Cook Book. 

written than the first expression. Place an egg in one 
tablespoon, then pack butter in another till it fills the 
spoon in the same proportion as the egg, and 3'ou will 
easil}^ cavvy it in mind. 

Have 3'our materials measured or at hand, and all uten- 
sils ready before beginning the mixing, or putting the 
ingredients together. Keep a bucket or pan full of flour, 
freshly sifted each day, and ready for use. Measure flour 
first, and put it in a bowl or pan together with salt, soda, 
cream of tartar, and spice ; measure butter and put it in 
the mixing-bowl ; then measure the sugar, and, in scraping 
out the sugar, take the butter which has adhered to the 
cup. Break your eggs on the edge of the cup ; if the white 
be clear, the egg is good. Put the yolks in one bowl and 
the whites in another ; measure the milk or liquid, and, 
after using the beaten 3'olk, clean out the bowl with the 
milk. Or, measure all the dry ingredients, break and sep- 
arate the eggs, measure the milk, add it to the beaten 
yolks, and measure the melted butter last. In either way 
you can make one cup do for all without washing. "Two 
eggs beaten separatel}' " means that the 3'olks and whites 
are to be beaten separatel}', not each whole Qgg beaten 
separatel3\ 

A tablespoonful of melted butter is measured after melt- 
ing. A tablespoonful of butter melted is measured before 
melting. 

To economize space, in many of the receipts the abbre- 
viations are written : one cup for one cupful, tablesp. for 
tablespoonful, teasp. for teaspoonful, and saltsp. for salt- 
spoonful. All these measures mean a full measure, unless 
scant or heaping measures are specified.

Mixing. 

Next to care in measurino^ comes the manner of mixincr. 
The most accurate measurement of the best materials is 
often rendered useless b}^ a neglect to put them together 
properly, and the blame is usually charged to the oven or 
the receipt. There are three distinct wa^'s of mixing : 
Stirring, Beating, and Cutting or Folding. 

Stirring. — Let the bowl of the spoon rest slightly on 
the bottom of the mixing-bowl ; then move round and 
round in widening circles, without lifting the spoon out of 



Mixing. 33 



the mixture, except to scrape the sides of the bowl occa- 
sionalh'. Stir slowly at first, to avoid spattering ; add the 
liquid gradually, and be sure the bowl of the spoon (not 
the edge nor the tip merely) touches the bottom and sides 
of the bowl. This is mashing as well as stirring, and the 
mixture soon becomes a paste. When perfectly smooth 
and free from lumps, add more liquid till 30U have the 
desired consistency. We stir flour and water together for 
a thickening, or butter and flour and milk for a sauce. 
We stir when we rub butter to a cream, or when we make 
a batter or semi-dough. When we make a stiff dough we 
stir at first, and then turn the whole mass over, bringing 
the knife or spoon round the bowl and cutting up through 
the dough. 

Beating. — Tip the bowl shghtly, and hold the spoon so 
that the edge scrapes the bowl, and bring it up through 
the mixture and over with a long quick stroke to the 
opposite side; under, and up through again, lifting the 
spoon out of the mass and cutting clear through, scrap- 
ing from the bottom at every stroke. Keep the bowl of 
the spoon and the sides of the mixing-bowl well scraped 
out, that all the material may be equally beaten. 

We stir simply to blend two or more materials ; we 
hent to add all the air possible to the mixture. We 
beat eggs or batter or soft dough. The albumen of the 
eggs and the gluten of the flour, owing to their visciditj' or 
glutinous properties, catch the air and hold it in the form 
of cells, something as we make soap bubbles b}' blowing 
air into soapy water. The faster we beat, and the more 
we bring the material up from the bowl into the air, the 
more bubbles we have ; but one stirring motion will de- 
stroy them. Yolks of eggs should be beaten nearh' as 
much as the whites, or till they are light or lemon-colored, 
and thicken perceptibly. The whites should be beaten till 
they are stiff and dry, or fly off in flakes, or can be turned 
upside down without spilling. When the two are to be 
put together, always plan to turn the whites into the yolks, 
as there is less waste than when the yolks are turned into 



34 TJie Boston Cook Book, 

the whites. Let the whites stiind a minute, then ran a, 
palette knife round the edge close to the bowl ; the}' will 
slip out easil}', and leave the bowl almost clean. For 
beating eggs, for nearly all purposes the Dover egg-beater 
is the best. There should be two sizes, the larger one for 
the whites of eggs. Hold the beater lightly in the left 
hand, and move it round through the egg while turning 
the handle. For frosting, and snow pudding, and all beat- 
ing of soft dough, use a perforated wooden spoon. Bowls 
with slightly flaring sides, and not too deep to be clasped 
from bottom to rim in the left hand, are most convenient. 
If tipped slightly toward the right, the beating is done 
more eflTectually. 

Cutting, or Folding, or Lifting. — Omelets, sponge cake, 
whipped cream, etc., should have the beaten white cut or 
folded in carefuU}' to avoid breaking the air bubbles. Turn 
the mixture over with the spoon, cut through, lift up, and 
fold the materials together, lifting the part from below, up 
and over, and mixing ver}^ gently until just blended. Do 
not stir round and round, nor beat quickl}'. 

All mixtures which are raised with eggs alone, should 
have the 3'olks and whites of the eggs thoroughly and 
separatel}' beaten ; any ver}' thin batter, like pop-overs, 
pancakes, or gems made without eggs, should be beaten 
vigorously just before baking. And many persons are 
most successful when all the beating of the eggs is done 
in the batter. 

Graham or whole-wheat flour is better than white flour 
for gems that are made without eggs, because it contains 
more gluten. 

Shall we stir only one way? No; stir any way you 
please, so long as you blend or mix the materials. But 
after beating in air bubbles, don't break them by stirring^ 
unless you wish to keep up the game of cross purposes 
indefinitely. Always let the last motion, before turniug 
into the pans, be one of quick, vigorous beating, except 
in those receipts where folding instead of beating is 
indicated.

BREAD AND BREAD MAKING-. 

Impoiiance of Bread. — Bread is one of the earliest, the 
most generall}' used, aud the most important forms of 
food adopted b}^ mankind. Nothing in the whole range 
of domestic life more affects the health and happiness of 
the famil}' than the quality of its daily bread. With good 
bread, the plainest meal is a feast in itself ; without it, the 
most elaborately prepared and elegantly served menu is 
unsatisfactor3\ 

Bread-making is at once the easiest and the most difficult 
branch of culinary science, — easy, if only sufficient inter- 
est be taken to master a few elementarj' principles and 
to follow them always, using the judgment of the best 
authorities, until experience furnishes a sufficient guide ; 
difficult, if there be an}' neglect to use proper care and 
materials. It should be regarded as one of the highest 
accomplishments ; and if one tenth part of the interest, 
time, and thought which are devoted to cake and pastry 
and fanc}' cooking were spent upon this most important 
article of food, the presence of good bread upon our tables 
would be invariably secured. 

Origin and Meaning of'-'' Bread. '^ — Bread is made from a 
variet}' of substances, — roots, fruits, and the bark of trees ; 
but more generall}' from certain grains. The word bread 
is derived from the verb to bray^ or pound, expressive of the 
old method of preparing the grain. Bread is therefore 
made of something brayed, as brayed wheat or braj-ed 
corn. But these brayed or ground materials are not prop- 
erl}' bread until they are mixed or moistened with water. 
Then the brayed grain becomes dough, from a word mean- 
ing to wet., or moisten. In primitive times this wetted 
meal or dough was baked at once in hot ashes, and made 



Wheat 37 



a firm, compact bread, exceedingly hard of digestion. 
Accidentally some one discovered that bj' letting the dough 
stand till it had fermented, and then mixing it with new 
dough, it raised, or lifted, the whole mass, and made it 
lighter and more porous. Thus we have our word loaJ\ 
from lijia?i^ to raise, or lift up. The old dough — or leaven, 
as it is called — ^ lifts up the dough. The raised mi.,s is held 
in place by the heat in baking, and becomes the loaf of 
raised bread. 

Bread made from Wheat. — Bread is made principally from 
wheat flour. Rye and corn meal are sometimes used, but 
better results are obtained when there is a mixture of wheat 
with one or more of these grams. Rye used alone makes 
a close, moist, stick}' bread ; while corn meal alone makes 
too dr}' and crumbly a loaf. 

Wheat is an annual gi-ass of unknown origin, cultivated 
more extensively in the Northern hemisphere. There are 
over one hundred and fift}' varieties of wheat. The}' are 
classified as red or white, in reference to the color of the 
grains ; as winter or summer, — winter wheat being sown 
in the autumn, and summer wheat in the spring ; as soft 
or hard, — soft wheat being tender and flour}* or starchy, 
and hard wheat being tough, firm, and containing more 
gluten. 

Chemical Composition of Wheat. — Wheat Is the only gram 
which contains gluten in the proper proportion and of the 
desired quality essential to 
the making of ligiit, spongy 
bread. It contains all the 
elements necessary for the 
growth of the body ; but, to 
meet all the requirements of 
nutrition, the whole of the 
grain, with the exception of 

the outer husk, should be coat of silex and woody fibre. 

used. Wheat has several 

layers of bran coats, the outer one of which is almost wholly 

pure silica and is perfectly indigestible. Underneath this

husk lie the inner bran coats, containing gluten, a dark sub- 
stance which is the nitrogenous or flesh-forming element, 

the phosphates and other min- 
eral matters which help to 
make up the bony parts of 
the body, and the oil which 
gives the characteristic odor 
to wheat grains. The cen- 
tre, or heart, of the grain 
consists of cells filled with 
starchy a fine, white, mealy 
powder, which has little value as food except as a heat 
producer. There is also a small amount of gluten dif- 
fused among the starch cells. For convenience, these dif- 
ferent parts of the wheat will be designated as bran^ or 
the outer husk ; gluten, or 
the inner bran coats ; and 
starch, or the heart of the 
wheat. The proportion and 
quality of the gluten and 
starch in different kinds of 
wheat varj' according to the 
climate and soil in which 
the}' are grown. The}' are 
also affected by the method 
of grinding the grain. Wheat grown in Southern or warm 
climates, and in the intense, though short, summer of our 
own Northwest, contains more nitrogen than that grown in 
cold, damp climates. It loses more water b}' evaporation, 
and consequently the seed is smaller and harder. In some 
varieties of wheat the outer husk is thin and smooth, and 
peels off readily under the stones. In others, it is thick 
and rough, and adheres closely to the kernel. In some, it 
is light-colored or brittle ; in others, dark-colored or tough. 
The husky portion of wheat is about fourteen or sixteen 
per cent of the whole w^eight. 

The gluten of wheat is a gray, tough, elastic substance, 
consisting chiefly of vegetable fibrine. It can be examined

Flour. 39 



easil}' hy making a dough of flour and water, and working 
it on a sieve under a stream of water. The water will 
carr}' the starch, sugar, gum, and mineral matters into the 
pan below, leaving a lump of gluten on the sieve. It 
closel}' resembles a piece of animal skin, and, when dried, 
has a glue-like appearance ; hence its name, gluten. The 
proportion of gluten varies from eleven to fifteen per cent. 
This tough, elastic quality of the gluten determines the 
quality of the flour. The more gluten and the tougher or 
stronger it is, the better the flour. The gluten of good 
flour will swell to four or five times its original bulk ; while 
that of poor fiour does not swell, but becomes water}' and 
sticky, and sometimes gives off" a disagreeable odor, owing 
to the deterioration oi the fatt}' or oily element. 

Preparing the Flour. 

*S'^. Louis Process. — There are several methods of con- 
verting wheat into flour. One is by grinding between two 
horizontal stones, the upper one revolving, and the lower 
one stationary- . The surface of the stones presents an 
infinite number of minute cutting edges. The upper stone 
IS convex, the lower one concave ; but instead of fitting 
perfectl}', the}- approach closer together from the centre 
outward, so that, as the grain is poured into an opening in 
the upper stone, it is at first rather coarsely crushed, and 
then cut finer and finer, as it is carried to the circumfer- 
ence by the centrifugal force. As the grain leaves the 
stones, the outer husk has been least aflfected ; the tough, 
coherent gluten is divided minutely, while the brittle starch, 
which forms two thirds of the grain, is completely crushed. 
The miller then divides these products, by sifting or bolt- 
ing, into j^??e^o?«r, coarse Jlour, and bran. 

The bran should be discarded as utterly useless for 
human food ; but it is often mixed with an inferior quality 
of fine flour, and sold as Graham flour. It was at one 
time considered valuable as a food for those sufiering 
from constipation, chiefly on account of its coarseness ; but 



40 The Boston Cook Book, 

science has shown us receutl}' that minute points of glass 
(and bran is nothing else) are not Nature's best agents in 
removing effete matters from the system. All of the so- 
called Graham flour made by this process should be sifted 
before using. 

The coarse fiour will vary in quality, according as it has 
more or less of the outer bran mixed with it. In the soft 
wheats the husk peels off readily under the stones, and is 
easily separated b}' bolting ; and as these soft varieties 
contain the smallest proportion of gluten, they yield a coarse 
flour, containing only an average amount of gluten, and 
the whitest fine-fiour. But in the hard, fl^^^ty wheats, tliis 
outer husk clings so closely that much of it is ground up 
finel}^ with the flour, giving it a dark color. This flour, as 
it contains a large proportion of gluten, would be more 
nutritious were it not that much of the gluten adheres to 
the hulls, and is lost b}' sifting them out, and much of the 
fine, flinty bran is retained in the flour, which makes it 
irritating and indigestible. 

The qualit}' of thQ fine fiour depends upon the quality of 
the wheat, in the first place ; also upon the number of sift- 
ings, being richer in gluten the less it is sifted ; and upon 
the way in which it is stored. The process of grinding 
with the stones heats the flour ; and as it is often thrust 
upon the market without being properl}' cooled and dried, 
it spoils very rapidh\ Flour made by this process of 
grinding is called the St. Louis, or old-process flour. When 
made of the very best qualit}^ of grain and carefull}- pre- 
pared, it makes a sweet, nutritious bread, and is excellent 
in cake and pastr3\ It is often designated pastry flour. 

Haxall Process. — Another method of making flour is 
by the 7icw, or Haxall process, so called from the name of 
the inventor. By this process the outer husk is first re- 
moved, or decorticated ; then the cleaned grain is cut by a 
system of knives, which reduces it to a fine powder with- 
out the injurious effects of heating. Tliis fiour has a 
slightly granular consistency, owing to the presence of 
minute particles of hard, flinty eluten. It is usually made 



Flour. 41 



from the best qualit}^ of wheat, and keeps well. It is con- 
sidered b}' man}' as the best flour for bread, as it makes a 
whiter, nicer-looking loaf. Haxall flour swells more than 
that made b}' the old process, as it contains more of the 
gluten ; the same measure making a greater quantitj' of 
bread than the St. Louis flour. It is, therefore, cheaper 
in the end, though costing more per barrel. B}^ repeated 
siftings, this flour loses its gluten, as does that made by 
the St. Louis process, and consequentl}' is then inferior as 
a food. But we can suppl}' b}' other flours and other food 
what this flour lacks in nutritious qualities ; and until the 
popular taste is educated to demand the amount of nutri- 
ment contained in bread rather than the whiteness of it, as 
a test of its qualit}', it is well to make our fine, white bread 
from this, which is the best flour, and have it as nearly 
perfect as possible. 

There have been man}' variations of the Haxall process, 
and all are included under the term new-process flour. 

Minnesota. — The Minnesota, or patent-process, flour is 
now considered one of the best grades. The Washburn, 
Pillsbury, and many other mills located in Minneapohs are 
the largest flour-mills in the world, and produce an excel- 
lent qualit}' of flour, in which a large proportion of the 
gluten is retained. This Minnesota flour is made from 
carefulh' selected wheat grown in the Red River region, 
the best wheat-growing section in America. The first step 
in the process is the breaking oflT of the germinal point of 
each gi'ain bj' what are called ending stones. Then it is 
sent through corrugated iron rollers, having shallow grooves 
cut spiralh' upon them, with rounded ridges between, and 
the opposing rollers grooved in an opposite direction. The 
grains are crushed (not ground) ; the starchy parts, or 
middlings, being quite finely powdered and easil}' separa- 
ted from the bran or tailings. After this separation the 
middlings are passed through ten bolting-cloths, and 
then through other and finer corrugated machines, and 
made into the various grades oZ fine, superfine^ SiU^S. fancy 
flours. 



42 The Boston Cook Book. 

Health-Food Flour. — A still better method of convert- 
ing wheat into flour, and one which is indorsed by leading 
scientists and physicians, has been recentl}' introduced by 
the Health Food Compan}' of New York. Onl}' the choicest 
kinds of wheat are used. The outer husk is first removed 
b}' moistening the grain, and subjecting it to a gentle rub- 
bing by what is termed the " attrition process." This 
softens the wood}^ fibre of the outer bran, which is easily 
removed by sifting, but does not afiject the hard gluten 
coats. The grains are dried, then pulverized into various 
grades b}^ a compressed cold-air blast, which dashes the 
grains into atoms with tremendous force. This is called 
whole-ivheat flour, the name indicating that the whole of the 
gluten, or nutritive part of the flour, is retained. It is not 
sifted like other flours, but pulverized into all the varieties 
of crushed wheats coarse granulated and fine granulated wheat; 
each varietj^ even the finest flour, containing all that is 
valuable as food. Bread made with this flour has been 
found, after repeated trial, to be sweet and agreeable to the 
taste, light and spongy in texture, with none of the objec- 
tionable features of Graham bread, and answering fully all 
the demands of perfect nutrition. 

Cheap inferior Graham flour, made of poor flour mixed 
with bran, is worse than no food at all. Any flour con- 
taining much of the indigestible bran causes irritation of 
the digestive organs ; all the food is hurried through the 
aUmentary canal before digestion is complete or all the 
nutriment can be absorbed, and thus is neither economical 
nor healthful. Fine flour containing the most gluten is the 
most nutritious, because it is all digested, and the loss of 
albuminous material can be supplied from other sources. 

The Arlington, the Franklin, and some other brands of 
whole-wheat flour, are highly indorsed by those familiar 
with them. 

The Tests of Good Flour. 

The first requisite in making good bread is to use good 
flour. Good flour should not be pure white in color, but 



Tests of Flour, 43 



of a creamy, 3'ellowish-white shade. If it feel damp, 
clamm}', or stick}', and gradually form into lumps or 
cakes, it is not the best. Good flour holds together in a 
mass, when squeezed b}' the hand, and retains the impres- 
sion of the fingers, and even the marks of the skin, much 
longer than poor flour ; when made into a dough, it is 
elastic, easy to be kneaded, will sta}' in a round puffy 
shape, and will take up a large amount of water : while 
poor flour will be stick}-, flatten, or spread itself over the 
board, and will never seem to be stiff' enough to be handled, 
no matter how much flour is used. Haxall flour has a fine 
granular consistency, and runs easily through the sieve or 
the fingers like fine meal ; while good St. Louis flour feels 
soft and oily. It is extravagant to buy poor or even 
doubtful flour. But, should it have ever}' appearance of 
being good flour, and yet not make good bread, do not 
condemn the flour without a fair trial ; and be sure the 
fault is nowhere else. 

Every experienced cook has her own tests for flour, and 
some of them are amusing, if not reliable. The best way 
is to buy a small quantity at first, and make it into dough ; 
then, if satisfactory, purchase whatever amount is re- 
quired, and buy this same brand as long as it proves of 
uniform quality. The names given to flour are not a sure 
criterion of the quality. The flour may come from the 
same growth of wheat, and be ground in the same manner 
and at the same mill, and yet the miller or the wholesale 
dealers will brand it diff'erently. And the same brand will 
vary in quality from year to year. Some of the varieties 
sold in Boston, and known to be good by personal trial, 
are Pillsbury's, Washburn & Crosby's, Swan's Down, 
Taylor's Best, Brown's Best, Marguerite, etc. ; the same 
flour may be known in other cities under different names. 
There are others equally good, and every year some new 
brand is announced. It is estimated that one barrel of 
flour will last one person one year ; which gives a rule 
of proportion by which to buy. Most good housekeepers 
agree that flour is not improved by long keeping, though 



44 The Boston Cook Book, 

flour dealers think differently. Flour should be kept in a 
cool, dr}- place, as the least dampness causes it to absorb 
moisture ; the gluten loses its tenacity, becomes stick}', 
and the bread made from it is coarser and less light. 

For small families it is better to buy whole-wheat flour 
b}^ the bag or half-barrel ; Haxall, for bread, hy the bar- 
rel ; and the best St. Louis flour for cake and pastry, by 
the bag, as a much smaller proportion is needed (or should 
be) for these indigestibles, than for the " staff of life." 

Bread, Fermented and Unfermented. 

Now, having discussed the subject of the flour, the next 
step in order is the different wa3's of making it into bread. 
These may all be included under two divisions, — those 
made bj^ fermentation, and those without fermentation. 

Fermentation^ what is it"^ — Fermentation is that change 
in organic substances by which their sugar, starch, gluten, 
etc., are decomposed or recombined into new compounds. 
This change may be spontaneous under favorable condi- 
tions of air, moisture, and warmth ; or it ma}' be hastened 
by the presence of a ferment. K ferment is some albu- 
minous substance in a state of decomposition, and, when 
introduced into anj^ other albuminous substance, in how- 
ever minute a quantit}', causes a change which pervades 
the whole mass. These fermenting substances are in great 
variet}', and the germs of some of them are always present 
in the air. There are different kinds of fermentation. 

The lactic fermentation is the change in milk when it 
sours. The casein, or albuminous part of the milk, b}- 
exposure to the air and warmth, begins to decompose, 
becomes a ferment, and changes the sugar of the milk into 
an acid called lactic acid. This reacts upon the remainder 
of the milk, as any acid would, and causes it to coagulate 
or harden, and gives it a sour taste. 

The alcoholic fermentation is that which is produced in 
substances rich in sugar or starch, as the fruits and grains 
from which wines and beer are made. Some of these fer- 



Fermentation. 45 



ment germs are present in the juice of grapes ; and under 
the influence of air, moisture, and warmth, they seize 
upon the sugar ah'ead}' present in the natural fruit juices, 
and an}' that may be added, and convert it into carbonic 
acid gas and alcohol. In the grains, a portion of the 
gluten ferments and changes the starch into sugar, and 
then the sugar iuto carbonic acid and alcohol. In con- 
verting the starch into sugar there is no change evident to 
the e^^e ; but as soon as the sugar is decomposed into alco- 
hol and carbonic acid gas, large bubbles of gas appear, 
which swell the whole mass. 

Acetic fermentation is caused by allowing alcoholic fer- 
mentation to go on beyond a certain limit, or in a tem- 
perature above 90"^. A familiar illustration of this is the 
change of wine or cider into vinegar. 

Now, bread-dough contains gluten, sugar, and starch ; 
and if the dough be kept warm for a certain time, lactic 
fermentation will be developed spontaneously , and the bread 
made from such dough will be sour and heavy. Alco- 
holic fermentation can also be spontaneously produced in 
dough, by making first a batter (as the semi-fluid state 
is more favorable to rapid chemical change), and subject- 
ing it to a temperature of 110° for five or six hours ; then, 
adding more flour, allowing it to rise again, and then 
baking it. Bread made in this way is called salt or milk- 
rising's bread. But it does not keep well, and is not gen- 
erally liked. 

It is not always convenient to wait for dough to be 
raised in this manner, so we hasten the process by the 
addition of some active ferment. Leaven, or a piece of 
old dough, left to sour, and then mixed with the new 
dough was formerly used ; this produced lactic as well as 
alcoholic fermentation, and though the bread was light and 
spongy in texture, it had an unpleasant sour taste. But 
since the chemistr}^ of 3'east fermentation has been under- 
stood, yeast has come to be considered the best ferment for 
producing alcoholic fermentation in bread rapidly, and 
with no objectionable result.

Teast, what is it? — Yeast is a plant or germ of the 

funt^us tribe. Under the microscope it is found to consist 

of numberless minute rounded or oval bodies which are 

true vegetable cells. Yeast is therefore one of the simplest 

and smallest of vegeta])le 

^^g^^^^^^^^^^^ organisms. Each little

brane, containmg a liquid 
or sap. The}' grow or expand from the minutest micro- 
scopic points, and seem to bud off from each other and 
multiply into many millions to the cubic inch. These 
cells are easily propagated in any medium where the}' find 
congenial food, particularl}- in the juice of grapes. If 
grape-juice be filtered and left to stand in a warm place 
two or three hours, it becomes first cloud}', then thick, and 
gives oflf bubbles of gas, showing there has been some 
change in its composition. In a short time a grayish- 
yellow froth, or layer of yeast cells, collects on the surface. 
" Whether the germs or spores of the yeast plant exist 
already in the juices of the living grape, or whether thev 
are always floating in the air, and cling to the exterior ot 
the fruit, and only become mixed with the juice in the wine- 
press, is not known ; " neither is it known just how they 
decompose the sugar of the grape. But it is enough for 
our purpose to know that they grow in the juice and ex- 
pand there, and that an active ferment may be dissolved 
out of these yeast cells, suflficient to cause alcoholic 
fermentation. 

The natural development of yeast through the agency of 
plants is too slow and inconvenient a process to rely upon ; 
therefore we manufacture it from various substances rich 
in starch and sugar. Brewer's yeast is made from malt, 
or sprouting grain, usually barley ; home-made yeast, from 
flour and potatoes. 

Yeast Bread the Result of Chemical Changes. — Bread 
properly made with yeast undergoes certain chemical 
changes which render it lighter, more porous, more pleas-

ant to the taste, and more healthful, because more easily 
digested, and more convenient for general use. It is gen- 
erally recommended b}' scientific and medical men as the 
best form of bread. 

AYheat contains a larger percentage of starch than of an}-- 
thing else. We learn, in the chapter on Digestion, that 
starch as such is not absorbed into the human system. It 
must first be transformed into sugar. All starch that is 
not changed into sugar b}' the process of cooking or before 
our food is eaten, is so changed b}- the p^^«/m, or ferment of 
the saliva, and the ferment of the pancreatic fluid. Anv 
process which produces this change for us makes our food 
more digestible. '' Powdered alum will dissolve in water 
sooner than a cr3'stal of alum." An}- fluid will penetrate 
more easil}- through a sponge than through putty, and the 
salivar}' and gastric fluids are no exception to this rule. 
Wheat starch in its natural state is close and compact ; and 
bread made simply with flour and water, and baked at once, 
will be close, dry, and difficult to masticate and digest. 
Good bread should be sufficiently soft to be easily crushed 
in the mouth, and of such a light, spongy texture that all 
the starch cells may be ruptured, and the greatest possible 
amount of surface be presented to the action of the diges- 
tive fluids. To obtain these qualities in bread, we trj' to 
expand the dough as much as possible without destroying 
its natural sweetness. Owing to the peculiar elasticity 
and tenacity of the wheat gluten, this is very easily accom- 
plished by alcoholic fermentation. The flour is moistened 
with some warm liquid, 3'east and salt are added, and it is 
then exposed for some hours to a temperature of about 
70°. The yeast changes some of the starch of the flour 
into sugar, and the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid 
gas. This gas, being lighter than the dough, rises, and, in 
its eflforts to escape, expands the elastic, glutinous dough 
into a mass two or three times its original bulk. The 
toughness or elasticity of the gluten prevents the gas from 
escaping ; and when this expansion has reached the desired 
limit, — that is,before the alcoholic fermentation has changed 



48 The Boston Cook Book. 

to the acetic and soured the dough, or the tough, ghitinous 
walls of the air cells are broken, — we check the forma- 
tion of gas, and kill the ferment by baking the dough in a 
hot oven. The alcohol escapes into the oven ; some of the 
starch is changed into gum, and forms the crust ; and the 
rapid decomposition, produced by the intense heat, causes 
the crust to assume a brown color. 

Unfermented Bread. — This is made without yeast ; but 
the principle is the same as in fermented bread, namely, the 
liberation of gas within the dough. The gas escapes quickly, 
and all such bread must be baked as soon as possible after 
mixing. There are no chemical changes in the starch or 
sugar ; the elastic, glutinous dough is simpl}' expanded by 
the gas. The starch cells are ruptured b}' the intense heat 
in baking ; but if the gas bubbles burst before the heat has 
fixed the gluten wall, the bread will be heavy. This gas 
is produced in the bread dough in various wa3'S : 1st. By 
the gas in ver^^ cold water, and the air obtained b}^ vig- 
orous beating ; 2d. By the introduction of water under 
pressure, highlj^ charged with gas. The first method is 
only suitable for mixtures which are to be baked quickl}^ 
in a very hot oven, and eaten immediately, like gems, 
puffs, etc. The latter method produces what is known as 
aerated bread, making a light, sweet, spongy loaf; but it 
is not practicable for home use. 3d. The usual method 
is by some gas-generating compound, as the union of an 
acid and an alkali ; usually soda, with either sour milk, 
cream of tartar, or muriatic acid. This is a convenient 
form adopted by many people who think it hard work to 
make yeast bread. When the chemicals used are pure, 
and in such a proportion that the}' neutralize each other, 
and leave onl}' Rochelle salt as a residue, this bread, if 
used only occasionally, is harmless. But Rochelle salt is 
a medicine, not a nutritive food ; and "those who are well 
do not need the disturbing influence of a medicine in their 
dail}^ bread," and those who are ill do not often need this 
particular form of medicine. Through ignorance or care- 
lessness this bread is often made so that there is ac excess

of alkali or a residue of alum ; and tiieii, if used habitually, 
it is injurious, and to some extent poisonous. It is con- 
venient to know how to make it well in an emergency, and 
it helps make variety. It is best, when freshly baked, in 
the form of small biscuit rather than in loaves, and is not 
as indigestible, when eaten hot, as hot yeast bread. But 
for a bread for general use, for bread that will keep well, 
for bread that will leave a sweet, clean taste in the mouth, 
for bread that will yield the most in bulk from a given 
amount of flour, for bread for promoting health, there is 
nothing equal to perfect, home-made yeast bread. It is 
not so difficult a task to make perfect bread as most young 
housekeepers imagine, or old housekeepers assert. It is 
not impossible for a young girl to succeed as well in her 
first attempt in this art as the mature housekeeper who 
counts her loaves by the thousand, provided she learns the 
best way of making it, and uses a reasonable amount of 
common-sense. 

The Best Kinds of Yeast. 

Who made the first 3'east ? and how does a young house- 
keeper start her own, w^hen awa}' from stores or friends, 
where she can neither bu}' nor borrow r are questions often 
asked. Simph* make a tliin batter with flour and water, 
and let it stand in a warm place till it ferments, and is full 
of bubbles. A pint of this ferment is equal to one cup of 
old 3-east in starting the new. 

There are three kinds of yeast in general use, — the 
dry^ the compressed, and the liquid, — each of which has 
its peculiar merits. 

Dry yeast calces are inexpensive, always ready to use, 
and generally liked by those who care more for economy 
of time and trouble than for the quaUty of their bread. 

Compressed yeast cakes, like the " Vienna " or " Fleisch- 
manns," are excellent, when perfectly fresh; the best 
form of yeast where bread is made in large quantities. 
But for a small family, where only a quarter of a cake is

used perhaps twice a week, or for those living at a dis- 
tance from the stores, they are not so convenient or 
cheap as good home-made yeast. They have almost en- 
tirely taken the place of baker's yeast. 

As to which is best of the many varieties of home-made 
yeast, who shall decide when housekeepers disagree? 
Everv good cook thinks her way the best. They are all good 
that make good bread ; the only special advantage of one 
over another being the greater ease in making or the 
length of time it will keep good. People who are inclined 
to shirk think it a deal of trouble to make yeast of any 
kind ; but there are none so independent as those who make 
their own yeast. 

The simplest form of liquid yeast is made with flour, salt, 
and boiling hop water. To this man3^ add potatoes and a 
little sugar, and some add ginger. Chemists say that the 
potato is the best form of starch for the growth of yeast. 
Potato yeast rises more rapidly, and keeps longer without 
souring, than flour yeast ; bread made from it is sweet, 
light, and does not dry quickly. As to the comparative 
merits of grated raw potato or boiled potato, those who 
have used them both ways with equally good results think 
the grated potato has the advantage of being made in much 
less time. 

The really essential points are that the water shall be 
hailing, so that all the cells of the flour or potato may be 
ruptured. The salt and sugar assist in the fermentation, 
and the hops and ginger serve to prevent the yeast from 
souring by checking the fermentation before all the sugar 
is converted into alcohol ; they also give it an agreeably 
pungent taste, if not used in too large quantities. Old 
potatoes are better than new for yeast, because they con- 
tain more sugar. Porcelain or granite kettles for boiUng 
the hops and potatoes, and earthen bowls and wooden 
spoons for mixing, are best, as iron and tin cause the yeast 
to turn dark-colored. 

The yeast for starting must be fresh and lively, and 
never added till the boiling mixture has become lukewarm,

or the plant will be killed. It must be kept warm, and 
stirred several times while rising, and the next day put 
awa}' in well-scalded glass jars. Keep it in a cool place ; 
freezing or intense heat will kill the yeast plant. Reserve 
a portion for the next rising in a small jar b}' itself, as 
opening the jar often causes the yeast to lose its strength. 
Always shake or stir well before using. Yeast is good 
when it is foam}- or full of beads, has a brisk, pungent 
odor, and a good deal of snap or vim ; it is poor when it 
has an acid odor, and looks water}- or has a thin film 
over the top. 

Making the Dough. 

Flour is moistened, or made into dough, with water or 
with milk. This softens the gluten and starch, dissolves 
the sugar, and cements all the particles together. Those 
who prefer water claim that water bread is cheaper, has 
more of the natural sweet taste of the wheat, and will 
keep longer ; while those in favor of using milk are equally 
sure that milk bread is more nutritious, more tender, more 
agreeable to the taste and the e3'e, more easil}' made, and 
with proper care will keep sweet and moist longer. 

Proportion. — The proportion of liquid and flour varies 
both with the flour and the liquid. Bread made of St. 
Louis flour, or mixed with water, takes more flour to make 
the same amount, than when made of Haxall flour, or 
mixed with milk. The general rule is one scant measure of 
liquid, including the yeast, to three full measures of flour. 
Water bread will need about one cupful more ; and milk 
bread, or whole-wheat bread, from one half to one cupful 
less of flour. Dough which is to be kneaded, or rolled 
and cut into special shapes, should be stiffer than that 
which is not kneaded, or is to be made into loaves ; but in 
all cases it should be mixed just as soft as can be handled 
easily without sticking, and just as little extra flour as 
possible should be used. If the dough be too stiff", make 
several deep incisions, and work in a little more liquid. 
The proportion of yeast is half a cupful of fresh home' 



52 The Boston Cook Book. 

made yeast to a pint of liquid: a little less in warm weather ; 
or when mixed at night, when the dough has a longer 
time to rise; or when made with a "sponge," or with 
whole-wheat flour, as the extra amount of gluten in 
this flour causes it to ferment more rapidl}'. A larger 
amount of yeast can be used when it is necessar3- to make 
bread in a limited time ; but great care must be taken not 
to allow the dough to rise bej^ond the desired doubling 
in bulk. With compressed yeast, dissolve one fourth of 
a cake in half a cupful of lukevxunn ivater, and use as 
home-made yeast. It will dissolve in one tablespoonful 
of water ; but it is important to have the half -cupful, that 
the proportion of liquid may be the same. 

Manner of Mixing. — Many people prefer to measure the 
flour, and add enough of the liquid to make it the desired 
consistency. The better wa}- is to measure the liquid, and 
add flour, using more or less o,ccording to the qualit}' of 
the flour, as the measure of the liquid determines the size 
of the loaf. All the flour may be added at first, and the 
dough raised in a mass ; or a drop batter may be made with 
about half the flour, and when this has well risen, the re- 
mainder of the flour ma}^ be added, and the whole allowed 
to rise again. The latter method is preferable when it is 
inconvenient to knead at the first mixing, as is often the 
case in the evening, or when there is an}' doubt about the 
qualit}' of the 3'east, as, if the yeast will not raise three 
cups of flour, it certainl}^ will not raise six. This method 
is advisable, also, when it is necessary to hasten the pro- 
cess of bread-making. Dough made by " setting a 
sponge," as this wa}' is called, requires less yeast, the fer- 
mentation being more rapid in a batter than in a stiff 
dough ; and this fermented batter acts like a double portion 
of yeast on the fresh flour, raising it very quickly. It is 
the best way of making bread with milk in the summer, as 
it may be mixed early in the morning and baked by noon ; 
and as it may be easil}' watched, it need not become sour. 
The question of mixing at night or in the morning is 
one which every housekeeper can best answer for herself. 



3Iixing Bread. 53 



Many old receipts read, •' Make a hole iu the flour, 
add the 3-east, aud then pour iu the Kquid." If the 
3'east be added to the milk or water, aud well mixed with 
it, and the flour then stirred thoroughly' into this liquid 
mixture, the yeast will be more eveuh- distributed through 
the dough, and less kneading will be required than when 
made b\- the old method. 

The other ingredients added to the dough are salt and 
iugar, in the proportion of one even teaspoonful of salt and 
one even tahlespoonfal of sugar to three pints offiour.^ using a 
little less salt if l>utter is added, and a little more with 
compressed yeast, as that is not as salt as home-made 
yeast, and doubling the amount of sugar when using whole- 
wheat flour. 

Sugar in Bread. — ]Many object to the use of sugar 
in bread. Flour in its natural state contains sugar ; this 
sugar is changed in fermentation. Just enough sugar to 
restore the natural sweetness, but not enough to give a 
realh' sweet taste, is necessar}' in fermented bread. 

Potatoes. — Potatoes are sometimes added to bread 
dough. Where the flour is of an inferior quahty, the 
])read is very much improved by their use ; but with good 
flour they are unnecessary, and the use of them increases 
the labor of making bread. 

Shortening. — Whether bread shall be " shoitened or not 
shortened." is another question on which there is gi*eat 
diversit}' of opinion. Those who disapprove of fat of an}- 
kind in bread claim that we eat fat enough in other forms 
of food, and also that the same crisp tenderness of tex- 
ture may be produced by skilful kneading. Bread made 
with new or unskimmed milk, and kneaded well, requires 
no other shortening ; but water bread, when shortened, is 
made more tender, and therefore is more easily pene- 
trated by the digestive fluids. The latest decision of the 
best physicians is that fat is absolutely necessary' as an 
element of food, and it is often given as a remed}' for 
some disease^. The proportion which one person would 
receive from one tablespoonful of butter, or drippings, or 



54 The Boston Cook Book, 

lard, ill two loaves of bread would not harm the most deli= 
cate stomach. Butter tastes best ; drippings are cheap- 
est. Lard has for its chief merit that of making whiter 
bread than either of the others. The shortening ma}' be 
rubbed into the flour, or, better still, melted in the warm 
hquid. Too much shortening clogs the glutinous cell- 
walls, and therefore checks the rising. Rolls, rusks, and 
buns, which are usuall}^ shortened more than loaf bread, 
should have the butter added at the last kneadhig. 

The bread should be mixed in a deep stone-china or 
granite bowl ; wooden bowls are difficult to keep sweet and 
clean. Brown earthenware is awkward in shape and 
clumsy to handle, W'hile tinware, being a better conductor 
than china, lets the heat w'ithin the mass escape, and the 
tin rubs off from the constant friction. Use a wooden 
spoon, or a wooden-handled iron spoon, or a broad-bladed 
knife. 

Kneading the Dough. — Kneading is the process of press- 
ing or working the dough in such a manner that the flour 
and water ma}^ be thoroughly mixed, and the 3'east oe so 
evenl}' distributed that the fermentation may be equal 
through the whole mass. It may be done hj cutting or 
chopping, either with the hand or machinerj' ; but there is 
nothing that gives the fine, even grain to bread so weh as 
hand-kneading ; and no surer test of the proper consist- 
enc}" of dough than that given by the sense of touch. 
There are some kinds of milk bread and rolls which are 
very good without it ; but water bread should always be 
kneaded. It is often done in the mixing-bowl, hy draw- 
ing the dough over from the side and pressing it down 
in the centre, turning the bowl with the other hand ; but 
it is more eflTectually accomplished on a bread-board. In 
Spain the bakers knead the bread with such force that 
the palms of the hands and the second joints of the fingers 
are covered with corns ; but strengtli and force are not so 
essentia] to good kneading as a pecuHar and dexterous 
handling of the dough. The most approved process is the 
following : — 



Kneading. 5 5 



Sprinkle the board with flour, and leave a little in the 
corner to lay 3'our hands upon. Scrape the dough from 
the bowl, and toss it over with the knife that it may 
be well floured. Flour the hands ; then, with the finger- 
tips, draw the dough farthest from 3'ou up and over to- 
ward the centre, letting the ball of the hand meet the 
dough, and then press down firmly-, giving the dough some- 
what of a rolling motion, that it ma}' not stick to the 
board. Repeat this motion until the dough is in a long 
narrow shape, then turn it at right angles, and draw up, 
fold, and press down again ; and continue this process 
until the dough is smooth, elastic, fine, and even-grained. 
Dust the board and the palms of the hands with flour often, 
but onl}' slighth'. Should the dough stick, lift it quickl3\ 
and always scrape off what has adhered to the board before 
dusting again, that the board ma}' be kept smooth. But 
do not let it stick ; keep it in constant motion. Do not 
knead hard enough to break into the dough, nor let the 
finger-tips pierce the smooth crust that soon forms under 
proper kneading. Use the fingers merel}' in drawing the 
dough over, and keep them up and out of it when press- 
ing with the ball of the hand. Use both hands in the 
same manner, or draw up and press with the right, and 
turn the ball of dough with the left, that all parts may 
receive an equal pressure. When enough of this smooth, 
soft texture has been formed all through the dough, it can 
be worked for some time without even a dusting of flour. 
After a 'little experience, if care be taken in the beginning, 
and only a little flour added at each dusting, when the 
dough is sufficientl}^ kneaded, the hands, the apron, and 
the board will be clean, and the dough of an even, elastic 
consistency, springing up instantly as you toss or pound 
or punch into it. The habit of mixing with the hands, 
and rubbing oflT Uttle wads of dough from the fingers into 
the whole mass, should be avoided, especialh' toward the 
last of the process. There is no mechanical operation in 
cooking more fascinating than the deft, quick touches a 
natural kneader gives to a mass of dough. Young ladies 



56 The Boston Cook Book, 

with pretty hands can dispia}^ them there quite as well as 
with embroidery, etc. ; but the rings and bracelets should 
be left in the jewel-case. The stitches in tight dress 
sleeves are not '' warranted not to break'' during this pro- 
cess. Perfect freedom for the muscles of the arms and 
chest is absolutely essential to the making and kneading 
of bread. 

Temperature and Time for the Raising of Bread. — In 
winter the water or milk used in mixing should be luke- 
warm ; and if the flour be kept in a ver^^ cold place, warm 
it before using. In summer the water need not be 
warmed, neither should it be ice-water ; the milk should 
be scalded (not boiled), and cooled. After the bread is 
kneaded sufficiently it must be made into a smooth round 
ball, with no dr\' flour left on the surface, and put back in 
the mixing-bowl to rise. If 3'ou have learned the knack 
of scraping a bowl thoroughly, it need not be washed ; 
otherwise it is well to wash and grease the bowl, that the 
dough ma}' come out more easil}' after it has risen. Notice 
how it fills the bowl, and let it rise until it has a httle 
more than doubled in size. Cover it, not with a cloth 
alone, as that serves merely to keep out the dust, but with 
several thicknesses of cloth, and a tightly fitting tin cover. 
It is important that the air be excluded, as it causes a 
hard crust to form, which will be difficult to mix thoroughly 
in the dough at the next kneading, and will also leave dark 
spots or streaks in the bread. 

The dough should rise in a temperature of about 75°. 
Avoid a draught of cold air, or sudden alternations of ex- 
treme heat and cold. If it be placed on a mantel or near 
a stove, it must be turned frequently. When necessary to 
hasten the rising, place the bowl in a pan of warm (not 
hot) water, and keep the water at the same temperature 
until it begins to rise. After fermentation has been well 
established the temperature can be lowered without harm, 
provided it docs not fall below 45°. In winter, bread 
should be mixed early in the evening ; and if the kitchen 
become very cold before morning, keep the dough in a 



Bread Raising. 57 



warmer room ; it will be risen by six or seven in the morn- 
ing. In summer, mix it later at night, leave it in a cool 
place, and the next morning attend to it early ; if possible, 
by five o'clock. In ver}' hot weather mix early in the 
morning, and bake b}* noon. It should never be allowed 
to rise to the point of '' caving in," or settling, or running 
over the bowl. Even if it does not become sour, it loses 
the natural sweet flavor of the wheat, and is tasteless and 
insipid. It should rise in a light, puflj', well-rounded 
mass ; and if it half filled the bowl at first, it will be read}', 
when risen nearly to the top of the bowl, '• to cut down," 
as most cooks express it. This is done by cutting it away 
from the sides of the bowl, and working it over into the 
centre with the knife. This releases some of the gas, 
checks the fermentation, and reduces the bulk somewhat. 
It will rise again very quickh, and the cutting-down pro- 
cess can be repeated several times, and the bread will be 
the better for it, provided the rising does not go too far at 
any time. It takes but a moment, and should always be 
done ^hen the dough is risen sufficienth', if you are not 
ready to shape it at once into loaves. If 3'ou do not wish 
to bake the bread for several hours, it can be kneaded 
again and put in the ice-chest or cellar. When the dough 
rises too long, and has soured, it will have a strong, tin- 
gling acid odor as 3-ou cut into it, and it will pull away 
from the bowl in long threads, having a water}' appear- 
ance, quite unlike the proper spong}' consistency and pun- 
gent alcoholic odor when it is just right. The practice of 
using soda to sweeten it, when in this state, cannot be too 
severely condemned. Chemists say that light sour bread 
is not unhealthful, although unpalatable to most Americans, 
Bread in that condition is eaten largely by the Germans. 
Sour bread sweetened b\' soda is unhealthful, as it is very 
rarel}' that the alkali is wholly neutralized by the acetic 
acid. Those who boast of never having sour bread be- 
cause the}^ alwaj's keep a bottle of soda dissolved and 
ready for instant use, should, instead, blush at the fact of 
such careless housewiferj'. With proper care, bread, even 



58 The Boston Cook Book, 

when made with milk, need never sour. But should the 
accident ever occur, it is better to eat the bread, or dry it 
for crumbs, or throw it away even, than to use the soc\a. 
This practice is so abominable that here it will receive 
neither aid nor encouragement. 

Shaping into Loaves or Biscuit. — At least an hour be- 
fore the time for baking, scrape the dough from the bowl, 
and turn it out upon the board, which should be dusted 
with flour ; knead it sHghtl}^, and divide into the proper 
proportion for loaves. 

The measures given in the following receipts fill two 
brickloaf pans, which are eight inches long by four inches 
broad and five inches deep, with nearly straight sides. 
This shape gives small uniform slices. Small round pans 
were formerly considered best for baking both bread and 
cake ; and there is some truth in the reason given, namety, 
that the cells which are formed by the gas are circular in 
form, and are much more uniform in a round than in an 
oblong loaf, in which the corner cells are easily- flat- 
tened or compressed, forming heavy streaks around the 
edges. But many people dislike the shape of the slices in 
a round loaf, and oblong pans have been more generally 
adopted. They should be greased with lard or drippings. 
It is better to divide the dough into four equal parts and 
put two in each pan, for several reasons : a small round 
loaf is more easily shaped, and can be broken, if wanted, 
while fresh, better than a long loaf; two small loaves 
rise and fill the pan more evenly than one long loaf ; and 
unless great care be taken in shaping to have the one 
loaf of uniform thickness, it will rise more in the middle 
and give uneven slices. Many make a deep cut through 
the middle to prevent this ; but that spoils the smootli 
round effect which adds so much to the looks of the 
crust. 

Use the merest dusting of flour in shaping, and knead 
just enough to work out the large bubbles of gas by fold- 
ing the mass over into the middle, then letting it si)ring 
open. Pat, coax, and work it with the hand and fingers 



Loaves 59 



until there are no wrinkles, and the loaves are smooth. 
Greasing the hands slightl}' with butter helps. All the 
flour added at this kneading rises but once, and too much 
will make the loaf burst out unevenly' at the sides. Some 
careless kneaders merelj^ fold it over, and if it look 
smooth on the top they think that enough ; but their loaf 
will sometimes have a seam or crack through it, which will 
cause the slices to fall apart easilj'. 

The loaves should come nearh' half-way up the pan ; and 
the same rule follows as for the first rising, namelj-, let it 
come to the top, or till the bulk is doubled. Cover with 
cloth and tin cover, or a large tin pan. The time for rising 
varies with the lightness of the dough and the temperature 
of the room. It is impossible to give a definite rule ; but 
should it rise too far and stick to the cloth, or look " tum- 
bled in," cut it down, knead, and let it rise again. Never 
bake it in the above state, as it will be coarse-grained, if 
not hollow. It is better to bake it a little too soon than 
to let it rise too long. 

Rolls and small biscuit should rise in the pans longer 
and be baked in a hotter oven than the loaf, because the 
loaf rises in the oven until the heat has penetrated to the 
centre : while in the rolls the air cells are very quickly fixed 
b}' the intense heat needed to perfect the crust, and fer- 
mentation is almost immediately checked. This is con- 
trary to the usual practice ; but it is the correct wa3^ 
Man}' people prepare biscuit for breakfast by letting them 
rise ten or fifteen minutes in a very hot place while the 
oven is heating. They are often onh' half baked, and then 
eaten smoking hot ; and those who have never had an}'- 
thing else think them just right. The evil efljects of this 
practice have been the occasion for much of the outer}" 
against hot, or even fresh, biscuit. Such are entirely dif- 
ferent from the dry, light, delicious biscuit which have had 
a natural, not a forced, rising, are of the proper texture, 
have been baked quickly, and allowed to stand at least 
half an hour before being eaten. The moral of the above 
is, never try to have raised biscuit for breakfast without

rising at least three hours before breakfast- time, unless 
you wish your fainil}' to become slaves to indigestion. 

The Temperature for Bakhig. — The object of baking 
bread is to kill the ferment, rupture the starch grains, 
fix the air cells, and form a nicel}' flavored crust. Bread 
could be baked by steam, as the air cells become fixed 
at 212°, and the temperature of the inside of the loaf, 
owing to the moisture, never rises aliove that point ; but, 
to give the delicious flavor of the browned crust, a much 
higher temperature is needed. The oven should be hot 
enough to brown a teaspoonful of flour in one minute 
for rolls, and in jive minutes for loaves. This is a good 
rule for those who do not use a thermometer, or cannot 
judge of the heat by their hands. The heat should be 
greater at the bottom than at the top of the oven, and of 
suflScient strength to last through the time of baking (which 
is about an hour) without replenishing the fire. Divide 
the time into thirds ; the first fifteen or twentj' minutes 
the heat should increase, remain stead}' during the next, 
and decrease toward the last. The dough should rise, and, 
after fifteen minutes, begin to brown slightly. If the oven 
be too hot, and the loaf brown too fast, a hard crust will 
be formed before the heat reaches the centre, and, pressing 
down on the air cells, make a heavy streak ; or, if removed 
from the oven too soon, it will be raw and doughy inside. 
If the heat be not suflScient to form the crust in fifteen 
minutes, the dough will go on rising until it becomes sour 
and pasty, and the air cells will run together, making a 
hole in the middle. The baking of bread is something that 
will not take care of itself. The old notion that 3'ou must 
not look at anything in the oven is erroneous ; and until 
you have learned by experience just how to regulate the 
fire and oven, and the many tests by which jevery good 
cook determines when bread is done, look at it often, 
and bake according to the clock from fifty to sixty min- 
utes. Better bake ten minutes too long, putting a paper 
over the top to prevent a burned crust, than not long 
«inough. Bake it brown ^ not black, nor pale whity-brown,

but brown all over. Rolls are often brushed with milk just 
before and after baking, to give them a richer brown color. 
Rubbing over with soft butter while still hot makes a crisp, 
delicious crust. When well baked, if tapped with the fin- 
gers, a hollow, empt}' sound will be emitted ; the crust 
feels firm, and, if broken apart, the inside rebounds in- 
stantly on an}' slight pressure. 

The Care of Bread after Baking. — Remove the loaves 
immediately from the pans, and place them where the air 
can circulate freeh' round them and thus cany off the gas 
which has been formed, but is no longer needed. A bread 
or cake cooler, made of fine wire, set in a narrow frame 
thirty inches long b}' twelve or fifteen broad, is a verj' use- 
ful article, as it will hold several loaves. An old wire 
window-screen, too small for modern windows, with cleats 
on the ends, to keep it two or three inches from the table, 
answers the purpose admirabl3\ Many use a wire sieve ; 
but that is small, and leaves the marks of the larger cross 
wires on the loaf. Never leave the bread in the pan, or on 
a pine table, to sweat and absorb the odor of the wood. 

If you hke crusts that are crisp, do not cover the loaves ; 
but to give the soft, tender, wafer-like consistency which 
man}' prefer, wrap them, while still hot, in several thick- 
nesses of bread cloth. When cold, put them into a stone 
jar or tin box ; remove the cloth, as that absorbs the mois- 
ture, and gives the bread an unpleasant taste and odor. 
Keep the jar well covered and carefully cleansed from 
crumbs and stale pieces. Scald and dry it thoroughly 
ever}' two or three days. A yard and a half square of 
coarse table linen makes the best bread cloth. Keep a 
good supply ; keep them sweet and clean, and use them 
for no other purpose. 

Fine white bread should be partaken of in moderation. 
Although the " stafi" of life," it is not necessary to eat 
bread with every kind of diet. It is most useful when 
taken with articles containing a large proportion of nour- 
ishment in a small bulk, as it then gives the stomach the 
proper degree of expansion.

Raw Potato Yeast. 



3^ cup flour. 

}^ cup sugar. 

1 tablespoonful salt. 



3 raw potatoes. 

1 to 2 quarts boiling water. 

1 cup yeast. 



First, see that 3'ou have at least three quarts of water 
boiling rapidl}'. Pare the potatoes, and keep them cov- 
ered with cold water. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a 
large bowl, and grate the potatoes as quickly as possible, 
not stopping to grate ever}' scrap ; mix them at once with 
the flour, using a wooden or silver spoon, that the mixture 
ma}' not be dark-colored. Pour the boiling water directly 
from the teakettle over the grater, and rinse off" the potato 
into the bowl, using perhaps a pint of water at first. Mix 
the water thoroughly with the potato and flour ; then add, 
slowly, enough more boiling water to make it the consist- 
ency of thin starch. The amount of water will depend 
upon the quality of the flour and potatoes. If it does not 
thicken, pour the mixture into a double boiler or granite 
pan, and let it come to the boiling-point, stirring well to 
keep it from sticking. Strain through a squash strainer and 
let it cool. When lukewarm (clear through the mixture, 
not merely on the top), add the yeast. Cover slightly, and 
keep in a warm (not hot) place, until light and covered 
with white foam. After it begins to rise, beat it well sev- 
eral times, as this makes it stronger. At night, or when 
well risen, put it into wide-mputhed earthen or glass jars. 
The next morning cover tightly, and keep it in a cool 
place. Reserve one cupful or more in a small glass jar, 
and do not open it until ready for the next yeast-making. 
Always shake yeast well before using ; take your cup to 
the jar instead of taking the jar to the hot kitchen ; when 
empty, scald the jar and the cover thoroughly. This is 
the quickest and easiest way of making yeast, fifteen min- 
utes being ample time for the first part of the process. It 
is whiter and looks more inviting than that made with hops. 
It keeps well two weeks, and makes delicious bread. 
This receipt can be varied by i!sing boiling hop-water. 



Potato Yeast. 63 



Steep one fourth cup of loose hops five minutes in thr-ee pints 
of ivate?% in a granite or porcelain kettle, and strain it into 
the potato and flour. Or the flour ma}' be omitted, using 
more potato or less water. Many think it an improvement 
to mix one even teaspoonful of sifted ginger witli the flour, 
sugar, and salt. The hops and ginger will make the yeast 
dark-colored, but it will not be perceptible in the bread. 

Boiled Potato Yeast. {Mrs. Towne's Matilda.") 
Three large., old potatoes., pared, soaked, and boiled until 
broken in 'small pieces ; half a cup of loose hops boiled in 
one quart of water. Drain and mash the potatoes ; add the 
hop water and enough more hot water to make tivo quarts. 
Strain, rubbing all the potato through, and put it on to 
boil. When boiling, add three fourths of a cup of flour^ 
which has been wet to a smooth paste in cold water, and 
three quarters of a cup of sugar. Boil five minutes, stu'ring 
well ; let it cool ; add three fourths of a cup of yeast ; and, 
when well risen, add one fourth of a cup of scdt. Keep in a 
covered stone jar in a cool cellar. Bread made with this 
yeast will not sour even in the hottest weather. 

Hop Yeast. 
Steep half a cup of loose hops in one quart of boiling 
.water., in a granite kettle, five minutes. Mix one cup of 
flour., one fourth of a cup of sugar, and one tahlespoonful of 
salt. Strain the hop liquor, and pour it boiling into the flour 
mixture. Boil one minute, or till thick. When cooled, 
add one cup of yeast. 



Water Bread 

2 quarts sifted (new-process) flour 
1 teaspoonful salt. 
1 tablespoonful sugar. 
1 tablespoonful butter, or drip- 
pings, or lard. 

Sift the flour, and fill the measure lightl}', not heaping, 
nor shaken down. Turn it into a laro^e bowl holdins: about 



% cup liquid yeast, or, 
3^ cake compressed yeast, dis- 
solved in }4 cup water. 
1 pint lukewarm water. 



64 The Boston Cook Booh 

four quarts. Reserve one cup of flour to add at the last if 
needed, and to use on the board. Mix the salt and sugar 
with the flour ; rub in the shortening until fine, like meal. 
Mix the 3'east with the water. If compressed 3'east be 
used, dissolve one fourth of a cake in half a cup of water. 
This is in addition to the pint of water to be used in mix- 
ing. Pour the liquid mixture into the centre of the flour, 
mixing it well with a broad knife or a strong spoon. Scrape 
the dr}' flour from the sides and bottom of the bowl, bring- 
ing the knife up through the dough, and turning the mass 
over and over until no dr}^ flour is left. If it be too soft 
to be handled easil}^, add a little of the reserved cup of 
flour. If too stifl", add more water. Knead it half an 
hour, or till smooth and fine-gi*ained. Cover, and let it 
rise until it doubles its bulk. Cut it down ; let it rise again ; 
divide into four parts, then shape into loaves, putting two 
in each pan, or reserve some for biscuit. Cover and let it 
rise again to the top of the pan. Bake in a hot oven nearly 
an hour. 

Milk Bread, No. 1. 



1 teaspoonful salt. 
)^ cup yeast. 
6 or 7 cups flour. 



1 pint milk, scalded and cooled. 
1 tablespoonful butter, melted in 

the hot milk. 
1 tablespoonful sugar. 

Measure the milk after scalding, and put it in the mixing- 
bowl ; add the butter, sugar, and salt. When cool, add the 
yeast, and then stir in the flour, adding it gradually' after 
five cups are in, that it ma}' not be too stifl"; use just 
enough to knead it. Knead till smooth and elastic. Cover ; 
let it rise till light ; cut it down ; divide into four parts ; 
shape into loaves or biscuit. Let it rise again in the pans. 
Bake forty or fifty minutes. 



Milk Bread, No. 2 (not kneaded). 

The same proportions as in the precedmg rule, except 
that about one cup less of flour is used, and the dough is 
not kneaded. Mix it with a knife, cutting it through and

turuing and working it over until all the diy flour is well 
mixed with the other materials. Mix it just soft enough 
to be shaped into a loaf after it has risen. Scrape the 
dough from the sides of the bowl ; smooth the top with 
a knife ; cover and let it rise. Shape it into loaves, and 
when well risen bake about fort}' minutes. 



"Water Bread (with a Sponge). 



1 tablespoonf ul butter. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 
1 tablespoouful sugar. 



1 pint water. 

}:_, cup yeast, scant. 

About 2 quarts flour. 



Put the butter, sugar, and salt in the mixing-bowl ; add 
one fourth cup of boiling water to dissolve them ; then add 
enough more lukewarm water to make a pint in all, half 
a cup of yeast, and three and a half or four cups of flour, 
enough to make a batter that will drop, not pour, from 
the spoon. Give it a vigorous beating ; cover and let it 
rise over night. This soft mixture is called a sponge. In 
the morning add flour to make it stiff enough to knead. 
Knead it half an hour. Cover; let it rise in the bowl 
until noon, or till light and spongy ; then shape it into 
loaves or rolls ; let it rise again in the pans ; bake as 
usual. This sponge can be divided in the morning, add- 
ing to one part of it white flour enough to knead it. and 
to the other part whole-wheat or rye flour and another 
tablespoouful of sugar. Make it just stiff enough to shape 
easil}^ into a loaf after it is risen. Use white flour to 
shape it on the board, as the rye and whole- wheat floui 
are sticky. Or make the dough a little softer, fill gem 
pans two thirds full, let them rise to the top, bake in a hot 
oven, and 3'ou have " raised rye or whole-wheat gems." 

Milk Bread, No. 3 (with Sponge). 

Pour one pint of scalded milk on one tahlespoonfid each 
of butter and sugar., and one teaspoonful of salt ; when luke- 
warm, add half a cup of yeast if mixed in the morning or 
one fourth of a cup if mixed at night. Stir in three cups of

flour, and beat well. Let it rise over night, or, if mixed in 
the morning, about three hours. Then add from two to 
three cups of flour, or enough to knead it, and knead half 
an hour. Let it rise in the bowl, and again after being 
shaped into loaves or rolls, and bake as usual. 

Whole-wheat or rye bread or gems can be made from this 
sponge the same as in the preceding rule. 

Whole- Wheat or Graham Bread. 



1 pint milk, scalded and cooled, 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 
1 teaspoonf ul salt. 

}^ cup yeast. 



5 or 6 cups fine granulated wheat 
flour, or 

2 cups white flour, and 

3 or 31^ cups sifted Graham flour. 



In the morning mix, in the order given, into a dough, a 
little softer than for white bread ; let it rise till light, stir 
it down, pour it into well- greased pans, or, if stiff enough, 
shape it into loaves ; let it rise again, and bake a little 
longer and in a less hot oven than white bread. Graham 
or whole-wheat flour rises more rapidly than white flour, 
as it contains more gluten. It is liable to become sour 
if mixed over night, and then the cooks resort to the soda. 
For the true remed}^ use less j-east, and use sugar instead 
of molasses, or mix in the morning. Always sift the flour, 
notwithstanding all cook-books say to the contrary. L^se 
a coarse sieve or squash strainer. Sift once, and, if 3'ou 
observe the character of the refuse, you will be glad 
to do so always. Bake part of this as biscuit or rolls. 
When made with ordinary Graham flour, the bread is 
much lighter if at least one third white flour be used. 



Squash Bread. 



1 tablespoonful butter. 

^< cup yeast. 

Flour enougli to knead it. 



1 cup squash, stewed and sifted. 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 
1 M cups scalded milk. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

Mix the sugar and salt with the squash, add the butter 
melted in the hot milk, and when cool add the yeast and

and shape into loaves or biscuit. When well risen, bake 

Rye Bread. 

Make by rule given for Milk Bread, No. 3, adding rye 
lour or rye meal to the white-flour sponge. 

Raised Brown Bread. {Mrs. H. B. May.') 



1 pint yellow corn meal. 
% cup yeast. 
1^ cup molasses. 



}^ teaspoonful salt. 
1 saltspoonf ul soda. 
1 pint rye meal. 



Put the corn meal in the mixing-bowl, and scald it with 
boiling water, just enough to wet it ; let it stand ten min- 
utes, then add cold water enough to make a soft batter. 
When lukewarm, add the 3'east, molasses, soda, salt, and 
xyo. meal. Beat it well, and let it rise over night, or until it 
cracks open. Stir it down ; put it in a buttered and floured 
tin to rise again ; sprinkle flour over the top. Bake in a 
moderate oven two hours. Brown bread made b}- this rule 
was first tested by the writer thirt}' years ago, when it was 
a wonder and delight to watch it as it was put on a wooden 
shovel and placed .n the great brick oven. It has been 
made in the same house regularlj' every week since then, 
and proves just as good now as it was In the olden time.

Sour Milk Brown Bread, No. 1. (Mrs. Wm. B. Johnson.) 



1 pint corn meal. 
1 pint Graliani flour. 
1 teaspoonf ul soda. 



1 teaspoonful salt. 
1 pint sour milk. 
1 cup molasses. 



Mix the meal with flour. Mash the soda and salt before 
measuring; sift and mix thorough!}' with the flour; add 
the sour millv and molasses, and beat well. If not moist 
enough to pour, add a little warm water. Pour it into a 
well-greased mould or pail, filhng it onl}' two thirds full. 
Cover it with a tight cover, also greased. Steam three 
hours in a steamer, or set the pail in a kettle of boiling 
water. Keep the water boiling ; and as it boils away, re- 
plenish with boiling water to keep it at the same level. 
Remove the cover, and place the mould in the oven fifteen 
minutes to dry the crust. 

Sour Milk Brown Bread, No. 2. 



1 cup wliixe corn meal. 
1 cup rye flour. 
1 cup Graham flour. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 



1 full teaspoonful soda. 
y^ cup molasses. 
1 pint sour milk. 



Mix in the order giv<;n, sifting the soda, and adding 
more milk or w-ater if not thin enough to pour. Steam 
three hours. One cup of raisins stoned and halved may 
be added to this, or any of the receipts for brown bread. 

Raised Biscuit and Rolls. 

The name "biscuit" is from the French, and means 
*' twice baked." It was originalh' applied to a kind of hard, 
thin bread, made in that manner to deprive it of all moist- 
ure and insure its remaining in good condition for a long 
time. It was something like our crackers and ship bread 
But in America it means an}' kind of bread made into 
small, round cakes and intended to be eaten hot or fresh. 
Raised biscuit may be made from any of the doughs made 



Rolls, 69 



by the receipts for bread ; the proportions are enough for 
one pan of bread, and one pan of biscuit containing twelve 
or sixteen according to the size. They should always be 
made small, and shaped with the fingers, not cut with a 
cutter. Divide the portion of dough reserved for biscuit 
into halves, then into quarters, and each quarter into 
bhirds or quarters. To shape a biscuit , take one of these 
quarters in the left hand and rest it lightly on the board. 
With the right thumb and forefinger draw a point of the 
dough up and over to the centre, and hold it down with the 
left thumb. Give the dough a slight turn toward the left, 
and repeat the drawing up and folding over until 3'ou have 
been all round the ball. You ma}' roll them in the hands 
until all these foldings have disappeared and the}' are 
smooth and round, and call them simply biscuit; or 3'ou 
may make the folds as distinct as possible, and place them 
at once in the pan. The folds will spread apart in rising, 
and when baked they can be peeled off in layers. They 
are then honored with the name of Imperial Bolls. Put 
the biscuit in a shallow round pan, fitting them closely, 
that they may rise up, round and puffy, instead of spread- 
ing. When very light, bake in a ver}- hot oven fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Keep them wrapped in a bread cloth for 
at least half an hour before serving. The receipts for 
Milk Bread are especially nice for biscuit. 

Bolls. 

Rolls are made by rolling the raised dough into small 
forms, with the hands or with a rolling-pin, and afterward 
cutting and folding into the desired shape ; the shape and 
manner of manipulation giving the distinctive names. The 
dough for rolls should be very light, and when wanted un- 
usually nice, more shortening should be worked into it after 
the second kneading. The rule for Water Bread made 
with a sponge is good for plain rolls ; Milk Bread made 
with a sponge is the same as Parker House Bolls, which 
have been generally adopted by housekeepers as the stand-

ard. The following are some of the best varieties and 
shapes : — 

For Finger Rolls ^ make a dough b}- the rule for Milk 
Bread, Xo. 2, and when risen and ready to shape, divide 
the half reserved for rolls into twelve pieces. Make each 
piece into a smooth ball as if for biscuit, then roll it be- 
tween the palms, or with the palm of one hand on the 
board, into a long roll about the «ize of the second finger. 
Roll with buttered hands or with as little flour as possible. 
Place them close together in a long, shallow pan. Let 
them rise to the top of the pan, and bake in a ver}- hot 
oven for ten or fifteen minutes. 

To make a Cleft Boll, make the dough into smooth balls, 
then with a floured knife-handle press through the centre 
but not quite through on the ends. Or make them round, 
and place them some distance apart on the pan, and when 
read}- to bake, make a deep cut through the middle. Make 
another cut at right angles with the first and 3-ou have 
a Cj'oss Roll. 

Parker Bouse Rolls are made after the receipt for Milk 
Brend with sponge, and when well risen and ready to shape, 
roll the dough on the board as 3'ou would pastry, and, if 
wanted richer, spread a generous tablespoonful of soft- 
ened butter all over it. Fold the dough, and roll out again 
until nearl}' half an inch thick. Lift the rolled dough from 
the board and let it shrink back all it will, and be sure it 
is of uniform thickness before cutting, or the rolls will lose 
their shape. Cut with a round or oval cutter ; press the 
thumb across the middle and fold over like a turnover, 
letting the edges come together. As the}' rise they will 
open a little, and, if folded only half-way over, the}' are 
liable to open too far. Spread a bit of soft butter the 
size of a pea on the edge before folding it, if 3'ou like 
the crusty inside which that gives. Or roll the dougli 
thinner, and put two rounds together with a thin spread- 
ing of butter between ; these are called Tic in Rolls. 

To make Pocket-book or Letter Rolls, roll the dough in a 
rectangular shape one fourth of an inch thick, and cut it in 



Sticks. 71 



strips four inches wide aud as long as tlie dough will allow. 
Spread with soft butter ; fold one end of the strip over 
about an inch and a half, and then over again. Cut off 
even with the folding, and then fold another, and so on. 
Or cut the dough into strips two inches wide by seven long, 
and spread each strip with butter, and fold one third over 
and then again like a letter. Or roll the dough out one 
fourth of an inch thick, then roll up and cut pieces one 
inch wide from the end of the roll, turn them over on the 
side, and place close together in a pan to rise. 

To make a Braid^ cut the rolled dough in strips one 
inch wide by six inches long, and pinch three strips together 
at the end, then form into a braid. Or roll little balls of 
dough into long pieces the same as for sticks, and then 
braid them. 

To make Crescents^ or Vienna Rolls ^ roll the dough 
until only an eighth of an inch thick ; cut into pieces five 
inches square and then into triangles. Hold the apex of 
the triangle in the right hand, roll the edge next the left 
hand over and over towards the right, stretch the point 
and bring it over and under the roll ; bend the ends of the 
roll around like a horseshoe, being careful to keep in the 
folding. Any dough that is quite stiff may be shaped with 
the hands into small, oval rolls with quite tapering ends, 
and baked far enough apart to allow each roll to have a 
crust all over. These are called French Rolls. Any of 
these rolls may be rubbed with a cloth dipped in melted 
butter ; or, better still, twist a piece of butter in a clean 
cloth and rub it over them just as they are taken from the 
oven. 



Sticks. 



1 cup milk, scalded. 
^4 cup butter. 
1 tablespoonful sugar. 
}4 teaspoonful salt. 



I/4 cake compressed yeast, or 
3 tablespoonfuls liquid yeast. 
White of 1 egg. 
About 4 cups flour. 



Melt the butter, sugar, and salt in the hot milk ; when 
lukewarm, add the 3-east (if compressed, dissolve in three 



72 The Boston Cook Book, 

tablespoonfuls of warm milk or water), then the beaten 
white and flour. Knead until smooth and fine-grained. Let 
it rise over night or till light. Shape into small balls ; 
then roll into sticks a foot long. Let them rise slowly and 
bake in a moderate oven, that the}' ma}- be dried through 
before browning. When shaped into large plain rolls, the}- 
are called White Mountain Rolls. 

Rolls designed for breakfast or dinner are better not to 
be sweetened enough to taste sweet ; but for tea or lunch 
more sugar may be added. This brings us to another vari- 
ety of rolls which are made richer by the addition of but- 
ter, sugar, eggs, and fruit, including Swedish Rolls ^ Rusks, 
and Bunns. 

Swedish Rolls. 



1 pint milk, scalded. 

3^ cup butter. 

3^ cup sugar. 

1 scant teaspoonf ul salt. 



Wliites of 2 eggs, 
ig cup yeast. 
7 or 8 cups flour. 



Melt the butter, and dissolve the sugar and salt in the 
hot milk ; when lukewarm, add the yeast and beaten whites. 
Mix in flour to make a sponge or drop batter. In the 
morning add the remainder of the flour, and knead twenty 
minutes. Let it rise till noon or till light; then knead 
again slightly, and roll out into a large, rectangular piece, 
half an inch thick. Have the edges as straight as possi- 
ble. Spread all over with a thin layer of soft hiitter, and 
a sprinkling of sugar, cinnamon, grated lemon rind, and 
currants. Roll up like a jelly roll, cut oflT slices an inch 
wide, lay them with the cut side down on well-greased 
pans, and when well risen bake in a hot oven fifteen or 
twenty minutes. When done, glaze them with sugar dis- 
solved in milk, and dry them a few minutes in the oven, or 
rub them with soft butter. If mixed in the morning, 
make a sponge with the scalded milk cooled, the eggs, 
salt, sugar, and part of the flour. Place the bowl in a 
pan of warm water for three or four hours ; then add the 
butter and the remainder of the flour. Knead, and after 
it is well risen roll out as above. 



Rusk. 73 



Rusk, No. 1. 



^4 cup yeast. 
2 cups flour. 



1 cup milk, scalded and cooled. 
1 tablespoonful sugar. 
}^ teaspoonful salt. 

Mix in a sponge at night or very earl}- in the morning. 
When well risen, add flour enough to make a stiff dough. 
Knead and let it rise again, then add one fourth of a cup 
of hiitter^ rubbed to a cream, half a cup of sugar ^ and one 
egg^ beaten with butter and sugar. Let it rise in the bowl 
till light. Shape into small round biscuit ; put them close 
together in a shallow cake pan, that they may rise very 
high. When read}' to bake, rub the tops with sugar dis- 
solved in milk, sprinkle with dry sugar, and bake in a 
moderate oven. 

Rusk, No. 2. 

Make a dough at night by the rule for Milk Bread, No. 1. 
In the morning make half the dough into a loaf for bread. 
Put with the remainder half a cup of butter^ creamed, with 
one cup of sugar and one egg^ well beaten ; mix and beat 
well ; add half a cup of flour ^ or enough to shape it easily. 
Let it rise in the bowl, shape into small rounds or into 
long narrow rolls, and when very light, glaze them and 
bake as in the preceding rule. 

Rusk, No. 3. {Miss Yandes.)

Dried Rusks are made after either of these receipts, and 
when risen are rolled thin, cut into rounds, and put two 
together into the pan. AVhen baked, the}' are pulled apart 
and left in a ver}' moderate oven to dr^'. Or the}- arc cut 
in slices when cold, and dried until crisp and brown. 
The}- are delicious soaked in milk and eaten with butter, 
or used the same as bread in puddings, or soaked in a

Bunns. 
Make a sponge over night with 

1 saltspoonful salt. 
I4 cup yeast. 

2 cups flour. 



1 cup milk, scalded. 
1 tablespoonful sugar and 1 egg 
beaten together. 



Beat it well and in the morning add flour to made a stiff 
dough. Knead fifteen minutes. Let it rise until light, 
then add one fourth of a cup of butter .^ softened, half a cup 
of currants^ and one saltspoonful of cinnamon or nutmeg. 
Let it rise in the bowl till hght. Shape into small 
round cakes, put them close together, and when well 
risen bake in a moderate oven. Glaze them with sugar 
and milk, or with white of Qgg beaten stiff with sugar. 
Make a deep cut like a cross just before they are put into 
the oven, and you have Hot Cross Bunns. Many prefer 
a bit of citron put into the middle of each bunn. These 
are better when freshly baked. It is therefore well to 
make onl}- a small quantit}-. The}- may be made from 
risen milk-bread dough in the same manner as Rusk, No. 
2, by using the spices and the fruit and a smaller quantity 
of sugar. This receipt for bunns makes excellent raised 
doughnuts by omitting the currants and rolling half an 
inch thick and cutting with a doughnut cutter,

This is similar to rusks and bunns, only richer ; and as 
it improves by keeping, it is well to make a large quantity. 



Stale Bread. 75 



At night mix one pint of milk^ scalded and cooled, one 
teaspoonfid of salt^ half a cup of yeast. Jive or six cups of 
■flour^ enough to make a soft dough. In the morning pre- 
pare one cup of butter^ creamed ; add two cups of brown 
sugar .^ one tahlespoonful of mixed spices, — cinnamon, nut- 
meg, and allspice, — ixud four eggs, 3-olks and whites beaten 
separateh'. Add this mixture to the beaten dough, and 
beat well. Add two cups of stoned and chopped raisins, or 
one cup of raisins, one cup of currcmts and half a cup of 
sliced citron. Flour the fruit. Let it rise in the bowl till 
light. Stir it down, and pour into two deep cake tins, 
making them two thirds full. Let it stand in a warm 
place fifteen or twenty minutes, then bake one hoar or 
longer in a moderate oven. 

Uses for Stale Bread. 

All bread crumbs left on the plates or bread board or in 
the bread jar, an}' broken pieces not suitable for toast, 
and an}- crusts or trimmings of toast should be carefully 
collected in a pan b}' themselves, and dried (not browned) 
in the hot closet or in a moderate oven, then pounded in 
a mortar or rolled on an old bread board, sifted through 
a coarse sieve, and put aw a}- in a dr}' place. These will 
be useful in covering anything which is to be dipped in ^g'g 
and crumbs and then fried. Bread crumbs brown better 
than cracker crumbs, and are much cheaper, being made 
from material which is usuallj' thrown awa}-. These are 
dried bread crumbs, and are not to be used for bread pud- 
ding or scalloped dishes, as they will absorb a great deal 
of moisture. The}- will keep indefinitely in a dry place 
Stale bread crumbs, which are not dried in the oven, but are 
made from odds and ends of stale bread, crumbled finely 
or grated on a coarse grater, are better for meat or fish 
stuffing, bread puddings, bread sauce, bread griddfe- cakes, 
scalloped fish, etc. They should be used at once, as they 
soon become musty. Any whole slices of stale bread ma}' 
be steamed or used for toast. 



76 The Boston Cook Book. 



Stale Bread Steamed. 

Have a large covered steamer fitting tiglitl}' over a ket- 
tle of boiling water. One with holes all over the bottom 
is best, as the steam condenses and runs down the sides 
and through the holes ; while in those with holes only in 
the middle it forms little pools of water round the edge, 
which make the bread soggy. Do not put in the bread 
until everything else is ready, as it takes only a few min- 
utes for it to become heated through. Arrange it all in 
the middle of the steamer, tilted against a small cup or 
dish so that the steam may pass between the slices. Do 
not let any of it touch the sides of the steamer, or it will 
become water-soaked. When ready to remove it, lift the 
cover quickly, turning it over instantly, that no water may 
drip on the bread. Spread each slice with butter as jo\x 
take it out, and arrange them on a hot platter. Cover 
with a napkin and serve immediately'. Stale biscuit may 
be made much nicer than new in this way. These direc- 
tions may seem needlessly minute ; but it is just these 
little things that make the difference between light, deli- 
cate, hot steamed bread, and the heavy, water-soaked 
stuff that is often served. 

Egg Toast, or Bread Sauted. 

1 egg. I 1 <^up milk. 

1 saltspoonful salt. | 4 to 6 slices stale bread. 

Beat the egg lightly with a fork in a shallow pudding- 
dish ; add salt and milk. Soak the bread in this until soft. 
Turn the slices by putting those underneath on the top, 
and dip the custard over them, being careful not to break 
them. Have a griddle hot and well buttered. Brown 
them on one side ; then put a piece of butter on the top of 
each slice, and turn and brown on the other side. To be 
eaten hot with butter, also with sugar and cinnamon if 
liked. This is one of the nicest ways of freshening stale 
bread, and is especially convenient when the fire is not in

order for toasting. It is called French, Spanish, German, 
and Nun's Toast ; but Egg Toast seems to best indicate 
the character of the dish. When fried in deep fat, it may 
be used as a pudding by serving with a sweet sauce, and 
is then called Italian Fritters. 



Brown Bread Bre.wis. 

Break one innt of dry hrown bread and ludf a cup of stale 
white bread into inch pieces. Put a tahlespoonfid of butter 
in a large fiying-pan, and when it is melted, but not brown, 
add the bread and cover with one pint or more of milk'. 
Let it simmer, stirring occasionally to keep it from stick- 
ing, until the bread is soft and the milk absorbed. Salt 
to taste. 

Brown Bread Brev/is, No. 2. 

Mix the same proportion of bread with one fourth of a 
cup of butter in a double boiler ; add milk to cover, and cook 
over hot water without stirring until the bread lias absorbed 
all the milk. If the bread be very dry, more milk will be 
needed. 

Toast. 

Bread is toasted, or dried and browned, before the fire 
to extract the moisture and make it more palatable and 
digestible. If the slices be cut thick and carelessly ex- 
posed to a blazing fire, the outside is blackened and 
made into charcoal before the heat can reach the inside ; 
the moisture is only heated, not evaporated, making the 
inside dough}' or clamrav, and when spread with butter, 
which cannot penetrate the charcoal, but floats on the sur- 
face in the form of oil, it forms one of the most indigestible 
compounds. The correct way is to have the bread stale, 
and cut into thin, uniform slices about one quarter of an 
inch thick. The fire should be clear, red (not blazing) 
coals. The crusts may be removed or not according to 
3'our taste, or the purpose for which the toast is intended. 
If you require only one or two slices, a toasting-fork will

answer ; but if a larger quantity be needed, there is nothing 
better than a double broiler with wires about a third of an 
inch apart. Place the slices evenly on one side of the 
broiler, being careful not to put in more than can be 
equally exposed to the fire ; close the broiler and hold it 
firml}-, that the slices may not slip ; move it gently over the 
fire for one or two nfls^ites ; then turn it over, that all the 
moisture ma}' be drawn out'; hold it nearer to the coals, 
and color it a delicate golden-brown. Serve at once in a 
toast rack or piled lightl}', that it may not lose its crisp- 
ness. Butter before serving, or send it dr}- to the table. 
Bread properly dried and toasted is changed from the 
nature of dough, which always has a tendenc}' to sour on 
the stomach, into pure wheat farina. It is not so scorched 
as to turn the butter into oil, but absorbs the butter ; and 
butter and farina, being easily separated, are quickl}' acted 
upon by the gastric fluid. Many persons prefer toast that 
is soft inside, but it should never be served to sick people 
in that manner. It is better to have it dr}^, and then mois- 
tened with milk or water, than to have it doughy. If the 
bread be freshl}- baked and 3-ou tJiust make toast, dr}' the 
slices in a warm oven before toasting. Alwa3's toast over 
the coals, or in the oven. If toasted over a hot stove, the 
crumbs fall through and burn, giving it a scorched and 
smok}' flavor. 



Milk Toast. 



1 p-nt milk, scalded. 

1 t^blespoonful cornstarch. 

1 large tablespoouful butter. 



}■£ teaspoonful salt, 
6 slices dry toast. 



Scald the milk ; put the butter in a granite saucepan ; 
when melted, add the dry cornstarch; when well mixed, 
add one third of the milk. Let it boil, and stir constantly 
till it is a smooth paste ; add the remainder of the milk 
gradualh', stirring well ; then add the salt. Put the toast 
in a hot deep dish ; pour the thickened milk between each 
slice and over the whole. Keep the dish over hot water 
until ready to serve. If liked very soft, the slices maj' be

first dipped in hot salted water, or in the hot milk before 
it is thickened. 

Cream Toast. 

Cream toast ma}' be made in the same way, using a 
scant tahlespoonfid of butter^ and cream instead of milk, 
or b}' thickening the boiling cream with one tahlespoonful 
of cornstarch wet in a little cold milk or water ; then salt 
to taste, and boil eight or ten minutes. 

Water Toast. 

Have a shallow pan with one quart of boiling water and 
a teaspoojiful of salt. Dip each slice of dr}' toast quickly 
in the water, then pile on a hot platter. Spread evenly 
with butter and serve very hot. Do not let them soak an 
instant in the water. 

Toast for Garnishing. 

For poached eggs, cut the bread into rounds with a 
large cake-cutter before toasting. For small birds or as- 
paragus, remove the crusts and cut into oblong pieces. 
For minces and fricassees, cut into small squares or dia- 
monds. For a border, cut, after toasting, into inch and a 
half squares, and then into halves diagonally, making tri- 
angles ; or cut into long pointed triangles. 

Entire Wheat Bread, Made Quickly. 

Put one teaspoon of butter and half a teaspoon each 
of sugar and salt in one cup of scalded milk. When cool, 
add half a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in one third 
of a cup of lukewarm water. Stir in fine whole-wlieat flour 
till stiff enough to keep in shape after you stop stirring. 
Mix it well, but do not knead it. Let it rise to double its 
bulk, then knead it just enough to shape it into a long 
thin roll. When light and double, bake in a hot oven 
about thirty minutes. Mix in the morning and it will 
be baked before dinner.

SODA BISCUIT, MUFFINS, GEMS, ETC. 

In making biscuit, etc., our grandmothers used saleratus, 
an alkali prepared by exposing pearlash, i. e., purified 
potash, to carbonic acid gas. Potash is a fixed alkali 
made from wood ashes. Now soda bicarbonate, made 
from common salt, is generally used. 

Crude soda is known as sal-soda or soda-saleratus ; 
when refined, it is carbonate and bicarbonate of soda. 
But the purest soda obtained to-day is that made from 
Kryolith, a mineral found only in Greenland. It is 
called Natrona Bicarbonate of Soda, and is an ingredient 
of the purest baking-powders. 

Pure, strong alkalies are powerful corrosive poisons, 
eating the coats of the stomach perhaps quicker than an}' 
other poisonous agent. This caustic or burning property 
is somewhat weakened b}" the carbonic acid united with 
them, and is therefore less in bicarbonate of soda than in 
the potash compounds. The latter are now seldom used. 
Alkalies when properly combined with acids lose this poi- 
sonous property ; the carbonic acid gas is liberated, and 
the compound formed hy this union is called a neutral salt, 
being neither acid por alkaline. When not properl}^ com- 
bined, if the acid be stronger than the alkali, the salt is 
acid ; and if the alkali be in excess, the salt is alkaline and 
still poisonous. 

Soda has a great aflfinity for water ; and when wet, a 
combination takes place which allows some of the carbonic 
acid gas to escape. This ma}- easih' be seen b}' the effer- 
vescence which occurs when soda is dissolved in hot water. 
This, the old way of using soda, was theoreticall}' wrong, 
as much of the gas was lost ; yet practically good results 
were obtained, because the saleratus formerly used was 
much stronger than the bicarbonate of soda of to-daj', and 
could well be weakened. 



Soda and Cream of Tartar. 8i 

Soda alone, when mixed with wet dough, will give off gas 
enough to raise the dough ; but it leaves a strong alkaline 
taste and a greenish yellow color, and, being poisonous, 
must be neutralized b}- an acid, or else its use is not ad- 
missible. The best acid for this purpose is one which does 
not liberate the gas instantly on contact with the soda, 
before the heat can fix the air cells, and also the one 
which leaves no unwholesome residue. 

Muriatic Acid, which is sometimes used, would be the 
best, as it leaves only common salt as a residue ; but the 
gas is liberated instantly-, and onh' a skilled hand can mix 
the bread and place it in the oven without losing much 
of the gas. 

Cream of Tartar, which is tartaric acid combined with 
potash, and is obtained from the crystals or argols which 
collect in wine casks, is preferred by chemists. Being 
only slightl}' soluble in cold water, it unites with soda 
only when heated, and the gas is not all liberated until 
the mixture is in the oven. The residue from the union 
is Rochelle salt, which is not injurious taken occasionally 
in small quantities. The objections to cream of tartar are 
these : being very expensive (the price var3'ing with the 
grape crop), it is often adulterated with cornstarch, flour, 
or other substances ; and the careless- cook guesses at the 
proportions of soda needed instead of measuring accu- 
rately. The only safe way to use these chemicals is to 
purchase cream of tartar of a reliable grocer, and to 
measure carefully one level teaspoonftd of soda to tico 
slighdy rounded teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar for one 
quart of four. It takes a trifle more than twice the 
quantity of cream of tartar to make the reaction complete. 
The soda must be finely pulverized before measuring; 
rub it on the board with a knife, measure, and then sift 
through the finest wire strainer into the flour. Sifting 
with the flour through an ordinary flour sieve is not 
enough. Cream of tartar does not become lumpy like 
soda ; but 'it is better to sift it, and salt also, into the 
flour, and then sift all together two or three times.

Baking- Poirders. — The most reliable and convenient 
quick leavening agent is a pure cream of tartar baking- 
powder. If pure, it will contain only soda Incarbonate 
and cream of tartar mixed by weight in the correct pro- 
portion, and combined w^ith the least possible amount of 
cornstarch or flour necessary for its perfect keeping. 
Any amount of starch above this is an adulteration as 
truly as if some harmful substance w'ere used. Baking- 
powders having their formula printed on the label of 
their tins, may be relied upon. Biscuits made without 
eggs require two level teaspoons of baking-powder for 
each cup of flour. Muffins and rich cakes with eggs, 
from one and one-half to one level teaspoon for each 
cup of flour or meal. 

Soda is also neutralized by sour milk or lactic acid. 
This is economical, particularly for those who have 
plenty of pure milk. But milk in winter grows bitter 
before it sours ; and the degree of acidity varies so much 
that the result is often failure. Sour milk is best when 
it sours quickly, and is thick and smooth, not separated. 
One even teaspoonful of soda to one pint of nicely thickened or 
loppered milk is the proportion. When the milk tastes 
or smells sour, but is not thick, use it as sweet milk in 
gingerbread or brown bread, where you have molasses to 
complete the acidity. Add a ver}' little more soda if 
the receipt call for sweet milk, or a little less if for sour 
milk. 

Nearl}^ all kinds of soda biscuit, muffins, gems, etc., 
should have the dry ingredients mixed in one bowl, and 
the liquids, such as milk, eggs, melted butter, etc., in 
another ; and when ready to bake, stir the two quickl}' and 
thoroughly together, and bake immediately in a very hot 
oven. 

Molasses gives another acid which is combined with 
soda, to raise and lighten dough. Directions for its use 
are given under rules for brown bread and molasses 
gingerbread.

Soda and Cream of Tartar Biscuit. 



2 full teaspoonfuls cream of 

tartar. 
1 large tablespoonful butter. 



1 quart sifted flour. 

1 even teaspoonf ul salt. 

1 even teaspoonful soda, meas 

ured after pulverizing. 

Milk to make a very soft dough : new-process flour will take a 
^int or more J St. Louis flour, less. 

Mix in the order given, sifting the soda, salt, and cream of 
tartar into the flour. Theu sift all together twice. Rubin 
the butter with the tips of the fingers, until there are no 
large lumps. Mix in the milk gradually-, using a broad 
knife and wetting onlj^ a small part of the flour with each 
addition of the milk. When just stiff" enough to be handled 
(not kneaded), cut it through with the knife until bareh' 
mixed ; it should look spong\- in the cuts and seem full of 
air. Turn it oat on a loell-fioured board ; toss with the 
knife till well floured ; touch it with the hands as little as 
possible ; pat it with the rolling-pin, which must be lifted 
quicklj' that it ma}' not stick ; and when the dough is 
about half an inch thick, cut it into rounds and bake 
at once. 

To make Twin Biscuit^ roll the dough out less than half 
an inch thick, cut into rounds, spread with softened but- 
ter, and put two together, and bake ten or fifteen minutes. 

Baking-Powder Biscuit. 

These are made in the same way as the preceding, 
using three rounding teaspoonfuls or eight level of 
baking-powder in place of soda and cream of tartar. 

Sour Milk Biscuit. 

These should be made the same as cream of tartar bis- 
cuit, using one pint of thick sour milk instead of sweet 
milk, and omitting the cream of tartar. Observe the same 
directions as to lightness and dexterity in mixing, and 
vary the amount of milk according to the flour.

Whole- Wheat or Rye Biscuit (with Soda). 

1 cup whole-wheat or rye flour. 1 teaspoonful cream of tartar.^ 

1 cup white flour. 1 ta])lespoonful sugar. 

% teaspoonful salt. 1 teaspoonful melted butter. 

}/2 teaspoonful soda. 

Milk enough to make a drop batter (about one cup). If sour milk be 
used, omit the cream of tartar. 

Mix ill the order given, and bake in hot gem pans 
twenty or thirty minutes. 

Cream Biscuit. 

When using sweet cream, make the same as cream ot 
tartar biscuit; and when using sour cream, the same as 
sour-milk biscuit, omitting the butter in either case. Any 
of these mixtures may be baked in gem or muffin pans by 
using more milk, and making the dough soft enough to 
drop from the spoon. 

Short Cakes, No. 1. 
1 pint sifted flour. 



H teaspoonful soda, measured 
after pulverizing. 



1 full teaspoonful cream of tartar 
(omit if sour milk be used). 

3^4 cup butter. 

1 cup sweet or sour milk, or cold 
water. 



Mix the salt, soda, and cream of tartar with the flour, 
and sift two or three times. Rub in the butter until fine 
like meal, or if liked very short and crisp, melt the butter 
and add it hot with the milk. Add the liquid gradually, 
mixing and cutting with a knife, and use just enough to 
make it of a light spongy consistency. Scrape out the 
dough upon a well-floured board ; toss it with the knife 
until floured ; pat into a flat cake, and roll gently, till half 
an inch thick ; cut with a small round cutter, and bake on 
the griddle or in the oven. If you use a griddle, grease 
it well with salt pork or butter, and cook the cakes slowly ; 
watch and turn them, that all may be browned alike. 

1 4 level teaspoons baking-powder may be used instead of soda and cream 
of tartar.

Mix the dry ingredients in the order given ; rub in the 
butter ; beat the egg and mix it with the milk ; then stir 
this into the dry mixture. The dough should be soft 
enough to spread half an inch thick on a shallow baking- 
pan. Core, pare, and cut four or five apples into eighths ; 
lay them in parallel rows on top of the dough, the sharp 
edge down, and press enough to make the edge penetrate 
slightly. Sprinkle the sugar on the apple. Bake in a hot 
oven twenty or thirty minutes. To be eaten hot with but-

and sprinkled with flour. Rub the butter to a cream, add 
the sugar, and beat again. Add the 301k well beaten, and 
then the milk. Stir this into the flour and beat thor- 
oughly ; add the white beaten stiflf, and, lastly, the berries, 
being careful not to break them. Bake in a shallow pan 
or in muffin pans about half an hour. 

These may be made with sour milk, omitting the baking- 
powder, and using half a teaspoonful of soda ; or leave out 
half a cup of flour, and substitute for it half a cup of fine 
vs'hite corn meal.

When well mixed, fill muffin pans two thirds full. Let 
them rise fifteen or twenty minutes, aild bake in a hot 
oven. Or thej' maj' be baked in muffin rings on a griddle, 
in which case it is better to add the melted butter at the 
first mixing. When ready to bake, have the griddle and 
rings well greased ; contrive to take up a spoonful of the 
dough without stirring enough to let out the air, and fill 
each ring ; cook until brown and well risen, then turn ring 
and muffin together, and brown the other side. Pull them 
apart, never cut them. This same mixture, when risen and 
baked in a buttered pudding-dish in which it is to be

Waflaes, Griddle-Cakes, Pancakes, etc. 

The names pancakes, fritters, flap-jacks, slap-jacks, 
batter-cakes, griddle-cakes, slappers, etc., are applied in- 
discriminatel}^ in difl'erent localities. 

Pancakes were formerly a kind of muflfln mixture, made 
a little stiflTer than a drop batter, but not stiff" enough to 
roll out, and were dropped from a spoon into hot fat. and 
fried like doughnuts. But, recently, the name has been 
applied to a ver}- thin batter made usuallj' without soda, 
cooked one cake at a time on a small well-buttered fiying- 
pan, and turned like a griddle-cake ; then buttered, and 
rolled over and over, or spread with sugar and jelly, and 
then rolled. In ''ye olden time" good cooks were sup- 
posed to have the knack of tossing the pan so skilfull}' 
that the cake would turn over itself ; but this is now one 
of the lost arts. 

For convenience and clearness, the following names will 
be used in this work : — 

Griddle- Cakes : any kind of small, thin batter-cakes 
cooked on a griddle. 

Pancakes: larger, thin batter-cakes, made without soda, 
and cooked in a small frjing-pan. 

French or Rolled Pancakes : the same as the preceding, 
buttered, sweetened, and rolled. 

Fried Drop Cakes or Fried Muffins : any muffin mixture, 
dropped from a spoon into deep hot fat. 

Fritters: a thinner mixture made without soda, either 
plain or with meat, fish, or fruit, and cooked by dropping 
into deep hot fat.

Waffles and Griddle-Cakes. 

A waffle iron is made of two corrugated iron griddles 
fitted and fastened together at one side with a hinge, and 
revolving in an iron frame, which is to be placed over the 
fire. It may be either circular or oblong. Each griddle 
is divided into compartments, which are usuall}' grooved 
into diamonds, hearts, rounds, etc. 

The iron should be placed over the fire, heated on each 
side, and greased thoroughh', as it is ver}' hard to clean 
if the cakes stick. Put a piece of salt pork on a fork, or 
■put a small piece of butter in a clean cloth, and rub all 
over both griddles. The heat will melt the butter and let 
just enough of it go through the cloth. This is better 
than to put it on with a knife. Close the griddles and 
turn them ; this causes the fat to run evenl}^ over them. 
Open, and pour the waffle mixture into the centre of the 
half over the fire, or put a spoonful in each compartment, 
filling them about two thirds full. Cover, and cook one 
minute on one side, then turn and cook a little longer 
on the other. An}' kind of griddle-cake mixture, with 
the addition of the melted butter to make them crisp, 
ma}' be cooked on a waffle-iron, if one cares to take the 
extra trouble.

white flour. If intended for tea, mix in the forenoon. 



To Cook Griddle-Cakes. 

A soapstone griddle, which needs no greasing, is the 
best ; but of whatever material, let it be large enough to 
hold seven cakes. Let it heat while you are making the 
cakes. If an iron griddle be used, put a piece of salt pork 
two inches square on a fork ; and when the griddle is 
hot enough for the fat to sizzle, rub it all over with 
the pork. Just grease it; do not leave little pools of fat 
on the edge to burn, and smoke the cakes. Take up 
a tablespoonful of the mixture, and pour it from the end 
of the spoon. The mixture should hiss or sizzle as it 
touches the griddle. Put one in the centre and six 
around the outside. By the time you have the seventh 
cake on, the first one will be full of bubbles and ready 
to turn ; and when the seventh is turned, the first will 
have stopped puffing and be done. Wipe the griddle 
with a dry cloth, and grease again after each baking. 
Turn 3'our griddle often, bringing each edge of it in 
turn over the hottest part of the stove, that the cakes may 
cook evenly. Always mix waffles or griddle-cakes in 
a bowl with a lip, and beat up the mixture well betwecE 
each baking. 



100 The Boston Cook Book. 



Griddle-Cakes. 



1 pint flour. 

}4 teaspoonful salt. 

1 teaspoonful soda. 



1 scant pint sour milk or cream. 

2 eggs, well beaten. 



Crush, measure, and sift the soda and salt into the 
flour. Mix thorough]}'. Add the milk, and beat well ; 
then add the beaten 3'olks, and last!}', the whites, beaten 
stiff. Bake on a hot, well-greased griddle ; turn when 
full of bubbles, and bake on the other side till they stop 
puffing. Use one half or one third jine corn meal or Gra- 
ham jlour^ to make a variet3^ 

To make Huckleherry Griddle- Calces ^ add one pint of 
berries^ picked over and rolled in flour. 

Some persons prefer to mix the sour milk with the 
flour, and let the mixture stand over night. In the morn- 
ing add the salt, soda, and eggs. 

Sour milk is the best for griddle-cakes, and when thick- 
ened just right, the cakes are very good without the eggs. 



Rice or Hominy Griddle-Cakes (no Soda). 

2 eggs, yolks and whites beaten 

separately. 
1 tablespoonf ul melted butter. 
Flour enough to make a thin 

batter. 



1 cup sweet milk.

Buckwheat Calces. lOi 



Raised Graham Griddle-Cakes. 

Mix one pint of miih^ scalded and cooled, one cup of 
ivhole-wheat flour ^ one cup oi ic kite flour, one fourth of a cup 
of liquid yeast. Let it rise over night. In the morning 
add half a teaspoonful of salt., one tahlespoonful of mo- 
lasses., one saltspoonful of soda. If too thick, add a little 
warm water. These are more wholesome than buckwheat 
cakes. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

Pour one pirit of boiling water on half a cup of flne 
com meal; add half a teaspoonful of salt. Mix well, 
and when lukewarm add half a cup of ivhite flour, one 
cup of buckwheat flour , one fourth of a cup of yeast. Beat 
vigorously. Let it rise over night. In the morning stir 
down, and beat again. When risen and read}' to bake, 
add one saltspoonful of soda, sifted through a fine strainer. 
Beat again, and fiy in large cakes. 

Buckwheat cakes, even if not sour, usually require the 
addition of soda just before baking, to make them light and 
tender. But when in their best estate, the}' are far from 
perfect food. They should be eaten only in ver}^ cold 
weather, and but seldom even then. They are better and 
brown better when made with boiling milk instead of 
water. 

Com Meal Slappers, or Griddle-Cakes (no Soda). 

1 pint corn-meal. I 1 saltspoonful salt. 

1 teaspoonful butter. | 1 teaspoonful sugar. 

Pour into this mixture boiling milk or water enough 
to wet the meal. AVhen cool, add two eggs, well beaten, 
and cold milk enough to make a very thin batter. 

Pease Griddle-Cakes. 

Take green pease which have been boiled, but are too 
hard to eat as a vegetable. Drain very drj', then mash,

and rub the pulp through the squash strainer. Or boil 
one cup of split pease till veiy tender, letting the water 
boil awa}'. Drain, mash, and rub through a squash 
strainer, and use the same as the squash in squash griddle- 
cakes. 

Squash Griddle-Cakes.

1 cup sifted squasli. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful sugar. 



% teaspooufiil salt. 

1 egg. 

3 level teasp. Ijaking-powder. 

1 cup flour. 



Pour the boiling milk into the squash ; add the butter, 
sugar, and salt. When cool, add the egg, well beaten, 
then the baking-powder, mixed and sifted with the flour. 
If too thin, use more flour ; and if too thick, add a little 
milk. The dry meal}' squash is the best. 

French Pancakes (no Soda). {Miss Parloa.) 



3 eggs. 

1 cup milk. 

3^ teaspoonful salt. 



1 teaspoonful sugar. 

3^ cup flour. 

^ tablespoonful salad oil. 



Beat the yolks and whites separately. Add the milk, 
salt, and sugar to the yolks. Pour one third of this mix- 
ture on the flour, and stir to a smooth paste. Add the 
remainder of the milk, and beat well ; then add the oil. 
Heat and butter a small frying-pan, and pour into it 
enough of the mixture to cover the pan ; when brown, 
turn and brown the other side. Spread with butter and 
sugar or jelh^ ; roll up, and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Fried Drop Cakes. 

The fat for fried cakes should be clean, new fat, half 
lard and half clarified beef drippings. By new fat is 
meant fat that has not been used for meat or fish, or be- 
come browned by previous frying. The same fat may 
be used several times by clarifying with several thin 
slices of raw potato, and straining through a fine strainer 
after each frying. When it becomes too brown for any 



Friea Muffins. 103 



flour mixtures, it will answer for croquettes or fish balls. 
It should be very hot, and still, not bubbling ; but not 
as hot as for mixtures which have been previousl}' cooked. 
The surest way is to tn- a bit of the mixture. It should 
rise at once to the surface, with much spluttering of the 
fat, swell, and begin to brown on the under side. Drop 
cakes will usuall}' turn over themselves, but doughnuts 
and fritters should be turned. The}' should be cooked an 
even golden brown, and the fat be kept at the right tem- 
perature b}' moving the kettle farther from or nearer to 
the fire. Tr^' them with a fork, and if it come out clean, 
they are done. 

Drain each cake over the hot fat, and when the}' cease to 
drip, put them in a squash strainer placed in a pan on the 
back of the stove, or drain on soft brown paper. Change 
the first cooked to another pan when the next are ready 
to be taken out. If the fat be not hot enough, or if there 
be too much soda, doughnuts will absorb the fat. The 
alkali in them unites with the grease, as it does in making 
soap. The eggs will prevent the cakes from soaking in the 
fat, and it is healthful and more economical to use them.

add one tablespoonful of lemon juice or vinegar. This bat- 
ter will keep several da^s. 

Oyster Fritters. — Boil the oysters till the liquor flows 
freely. Drain, strain the liquor, and use it to make a bat- 
ter, as in the preceding rule. Dip each 03'ster in the 
batter and fry until brown in hot fat. 

Clam Fritters. — Drain the clams, and chop the hard 
part. Use the liquor to make a fritter batter. Add the 
clams and fty by small spoonfuls in hot fat. Clams in the 
shell should be steamed and dressed. Drain, and dip each 
whole clam into the batter. If large and tough, chop the 
hard part, and use the same as raw clams. 

Apple Fritters. — Core and pare three or four apples., 
but do not break them. Cut them in slices one third of 
an inch thick, leaving the opening in the centre. Sprinkle 
with sugar., lemon ^ and spice. Dip each slice in the fritter 
batter and fry in hot fat. Drain, and sprinkle with pow- 
dered sugar. 

Vegetables for fritters, such as celerv, salsif}', or parsnip,

OATMEAL, INDIAN CORN, AND OTHER 
G-RAINS USED AS FOOD. 

Oatmeal is higbl}' nutritious, being richer in nitrogen 
than any other grain ; but a^ it does not contain a tough, 
adhesive gluten, like wheat, it is not easilj' made into fer- 
mented bread. Its nitrogenous matter resembles casein 
more than gluten, and is called avenin (from avena^ the 
oat). It is used as a mush or porridge, eaten with sugar 
and milk. It is rich in food for muscle and brain, useful 
for children and laboring people, but irritating to man}^ 
})eople whose digestive powers are weak. 

Groats, or Grits, are oats from which the outer husk and 
inner flint}' cuticle are removed. 

Indian Corn is used in many forms. Some varieties 
which contain a large proportion of s-jgar, are eaten green 
from the cob as a vegetable. The whole grains, hulled, 
are eaten as samp ; broken grains of various sizes, as 
homin}' ; the ground grains, as either coarse or fine meal. 
Meal grows musty very qnickly when ground by the old 
process, owing to the moisture of the corn and the heat of 
the stones. In the new-process, or granulated, meal the 
corn is first dried for two years, then ground into coarse 
grains like sugar. Indian corn is also used in the form of 
a very fine powder, called cornstarch. Corn meal, when 
cooked, is best made into small loaves or cakes and eaten 
hot. It is rich in nitrogen, and contains more fat than 
the other grains. This causes it to attract the oxygen 
from the air, and spoil rapidly. It should be purchased 
in small quantities. It is better adapted to strong labor- 
ing people, as it is very heating for persons with weak 
digestion. 



Cereals. 109 



Rye meal and flour are used, more especially in Xew 
England, in the form of bread and mush. Rye is sweeter 
than wheat, and makes a moist bread which can be kept 
for some time without becoming hard and unpalatable. 
Rye should be purchased in small quantities, kept in a cool, 
dry place, sifted and examined thoroughly before using. 

Barlty is used in soups and sometimes in gruels. It 
cannot be made into good bread, as it has too little gluten. 
It is nutritious, being rich in phosphates. It contains 
starch and mucilage, and, in the form of gruel, makes a 
soothing drink in fevers. The husk is removed, the 
grains are ground and polished, and then it is termed 
pearl barley. Barley crystals or flakes and granulated 
barley are also used. 

Buckwheat has less flesh-forming and more heat-giving 
elements than wheat. It is therefore suitable only when 
used in cold weather and by those who labor bard or exer- 
cise freely. It is used principally in the form of griddle- 
cakes. 

Rice contains very little of the flesh-forming element. 
It has more starch and less fat than any other grain. It 
is cheap, and is largely used by people in very hot cli- 
mates. It should always be used with milk, eggs, or 
some fatty substance. Rice is easily digested. 

Oatmeal Mush. 

One cup of B. B. oatmeal, and one teaspoonful of salt^ to 
a scant quart of boiling icater. Put the meal and salt in 
the top of the double boiler i add the boiling water. Place 
the upper boiler on the stove, and boil rapidly eight or ten 
minutes, stirring occasionally with a fork. Then place it 
over the hot water, and cook from forty to sixt}' minutes if 
liked dry, from two to three hours if liked ver}^ soft. Re- 
move the cover just before ser^ing, and stir with a fork to 
let the steam escape, to dry it ofi". Served with baked 
apples and siigar and cream. 

Oatmeal comes in three grades. B. B. is the whole oat 
with the outer husk removed. It is less pasty than the 



I lo The Boston Cook Book. 

finer grades. The Scotch consider the coarse oatmeal the 
best, the finer kinds being only suitable for children and 
invalids. 

Oatmeal, rice, or an}' mush that contains much starch, 
is more easily digested if it is masticated, and mixed with 
the saliva. When eaten as a soft porridge and still fur- 
ther thinned with milk, if it be swallowed whole, the saliva 
has no chance to do its part, and the whole process of the 
digestion of the starch is left for the intestines. The meal 
should be thoroughl}' cooked, stiff, and drj', rather than 
thin. 

Hominy^ cracked wheats and granulated ivheat are cooked 
in the same way, using only three cups of boiling water 
instead of one quart. 

The cracked ivheat ma}' be poured into a mould wet with 
cold water, and when jellied eaten cold with sugar and 
cream. 

Whole ivheat requires Jive cups of boiling water to one 
cup of wheat, and should cook six hours. 

Hasty Pudding, or Indian Meal Mush. 

Put one quart of water on to boil. Mix one pi?it of corn 
meal, one teaspoonfid of salt, and one tablespoonful of flour 
with one pint of cold milk. Stir this gradually into the 
boiling water and boil half an hour, stirring often. Eat it 
hot, with milk, and only in cold winter weather. 

Fried Hasty Pudding. 

. ook as above and pour it into a brickloaf pan ; when 
cool, cut into three-quarter inch slices. Dip them in flour, 
and brown each side in hot fat in a frying-pan. Or dip 
in crumbs, egg, and again in crumbs, and /r^ in deep fat. 

Any of these mushes may be fried the same way. 
When eaten with bacon, they make a nice relish for 
breakfast. 



Tea. 1 1 1 



BEVERAGES. 



Tea. 

There are three varieties of the tea-plant ; both black 
and green tea can be prepared from them all. Gi'een 
tea is made from 3'oung leaves steamed, roasted, and 
dried qiiickl}- on copper plates. Black tea is made from 
leaves which have been exposed to the air ten or twelve 
hours before roasting. The action of the air upon the 
leaves during this long exposure causes the dark color. 
Green tea gives up less of its juices in drying, and this 
accounts for its energetic action on the nervous S3'stem. 

The tea-leaf contains the largest amount of nutritive 
matter of an}- plant used as human food, though onl}- 
a small portion of it is extracted by our common method 
of making tea. There is a large proportion of casein in 
the leaves. Man}^ of the savage tribes of Tartar}^ boil the 
leaves with soda, and eat them with salt and butter. But 
in our method of using tea as a beverage merel}-, we use 
such a comparatively small quantity that the amount of 
nutriment is verj^ little ; its chief value being the sense 
of warmth and comfort that it gives. It excites the brain 
to increased activit}^ and produces wakefulness ; hence it 
is useful to students and night- workers. It retards the 
action of the natural functions, causes less waste, and, to 
a certain extent, saves food. For this reason, when not 
used in excess, it is suited to poor people, whose supphes 
of substantial food are scanty ; and to old persons, whose 
powers of digestion and whose bodily substance have 
begun to fail. It should not be used early in i;he morning, 
as the body needs immediate nourishment in a larger 
quantity ; and it should at all times be taken moderately, 
both as to quantit}' and strength. 



112 The Boston Cook Book, 

The water should be freshly" boiled. Scald and heat 
the teapot, which should be of earthen or china, never of 
tin. Allow one teaspootiful of tea for one cup of boiling 
water. Reduce the proportion of tea when several cups 
are required. Put the tea in a strainer, pour through it 
half a cup of boiling water to cleanse the grounds. Then 
put the tea in the teapot ; pour on the boiling water ; 
cover closel}^ and place it where it will keep hot, but 
not boil, for five minutes. If cold or lukewarm water be 
used in making tea, the thein^ or nitrogenous substance, 
will not be obtained. 

In boiling tea or allowing the leaves to remain long in 
the tea, by repeated steeping, the fragrant aroma is wasted 
and the tannin is extracted, which may cause gastric dis- 
orders to those who drink it. Never make tea in a 
tin teapot, as the tannic acid acts upon the metal and 
produces a poisonous compound. 

A slice of leynon is a good substitute for milk in tea. 
The lemon prevents the headache and sleeplessness which 
the tea causes in some persons. 

A French chemist recommends grinding tea like coffee. 
It will yield nearly double the amount of its exhilarating 
quality. Also to put a lump of sugar into the teapot 
with the tea. 

Iced Tea, or Russian Tea. 

Make the tea by the first receipt, strain it from the 
grounds, and keep it cool. When ready to serve, put two 
cubes of block sugar in a glass, half Jill with broken ice^ add 
a slice of lemon ^ and fill the glass with cold tea. 

Coffee. 

Coffee grows on small trees. Mocha, the best variety, 
is grown in Arabia. Other choice kinds come from Java, 
the West Indies, and South America. The fruit of the 
coffee tree is something like the cherry, and contains two 
seeds or beans. Bruising the fruit separates the berries, 



Coffee. 113 

which are then washed and dried. The raw berries are 
tough, diflScult to grind, and have but little flavor. Coflee 
should be roasted and kept in air-tight cans, that the fine 
flavor ma}' be perfecth' developed and preserved. Coffee 
is more stimulating than tea, and, when taken ver}' strong 
after a heart}' meal, aids digestion. It should be made in 
such a way that the full strength and aroma are obtained, 
without developing the tannic acid. This is done by pour- 
ing boihng water upon the coffee and keeping it in a 
closely covered vessel just below the boiling-point, or 
boiling not longer than five minutes. If allowed to boil 
longer, or left uncovered, the volatile oil which forms the 
fragrant aroma is dissipated, and the tannic acid extracted. 
This acid, when combined with cream or milk, forms a 
leather}', indigestible compound which irritates the internal 
membranes. 

The proportion of one third Mocha and two thirds .Java 
coffee is agi-eeable to most people. Many prefer to roast 
and grind the coffee for themselves ; but in coffee-houses 
the arrangements for roasting are now so complete, that it 
is well for small families to buy coffee already roasted, 
and to grind it as needed, or buy it ground in a small 
quantity. 

The coffee-pot should be of granite ware or porcelain, 
and kept scrupulously clean, cleansing the spout as well 
as the pot every time it is used. A brownish deposit is 
soon formed on the inside of the pot, if the coffee be 
allowed to stand in it long, or if it be not often scoured. 
Many a cup of ill-flavored coffee is owing to its having 
been made in an unclean pot. 

The proportions are, one heaping tahlespoonful of coffee 
to one cup of boiling water^ reducing the proportion 
slightly when several cups are requii-ed. Half a cup of 
ground coffee is enough for one quart of water^ and will 
make sufficient for five people. It takes a greater pro- 
portion of coffee and water, and it is more difficult to 
make just enough for one person than for more, as the 
last coffee poui-ed out is not as clear as the first. The 

8 



114 The Boston Cook Book, 

old notion of allowing extra for the pot is not without 
reason. 

Fish glue or inferior isinglass, which can be purchased 
at a druggist's, is a cheap and convenient article to use in 
clearing coffee. Egg shells should be saved and used for 
the same purpose. Wipe the Qg^>i as soon as the}' come 
from th':i market, and then the shells ma}' all be used. Two 
or three shells contain albumen sufficient to clear a quart 
of coffee. 

Various modifications of the biggin, or French coffee-pot, 
are in use, and the coffee made in them is excellent, as 
none of the aroma is wasted. Thej are general!}- quite 
expensive, and some soon get out of order, if not handled 
carefully. The spout of the coffee-pot should be closed 
with a cork, or a thimble fitted for that purpose, or a piece 
of soft brown paper twisted so as to form a stopper. This 
prevents the escape of the steam and aroma. Coffee, if 
allowed to boil, should stand at least ten minutes after 
boiUng, to give it time to settle and become clear. 

Roasting Coffee. 

Put one pound of raw coffee in a small frying-pan. Place 
it on the stove, and shake and stir occasionally for fifteea 
minutes, or till yellow. Then cover it, and increase the 
heat, and shake till the kernels are all a deep cinnamon or 
chestnut color, and have an oily appearance. Be careful 
that none are burned. Keep it covered, and when still 
warm, not hot, add one egg and its shell. Beat until every 
kernel is coated with the egg. The eg^ will dry quickly. 
It helps to preserve the flavor, is the cheapest form in 
which to use egg for clearing, and does not interfere w4th 
the grinding of the coffee. 

Coffee should be kept in air-tight tin cans, and ground 
only as required. Th^. finer it is ground, the stronger will 
be the extract. 



Coffee. 115 



Coffee (Common Coffee-Pot). 

1 heaping tablesp. ground coffee. I 1 e^g shell. 

1 square mch isinglass, or | 1 cup freshlv boiling water. 

Scald the coffee-pot. Put in the coffee and isinglass. 
Add the boiUng water. Cover the spout, and boil just five 
minutes. Stir it well. Set the pot on the back of the 
stove, where it will keep hot, but not boil. Add half a cup of 
cold water. Pour out a little of the coffee and pour it back 
again to clear the grounds from the spout. Let it stand 
at least ten minutes. If served in the pot, be careful not 
to roil the coffee by shaking the pot or b}' careless pour- 
ing. A tablespoonful of caramel mixed with the ground 
coffee gives additional flavor and color. 

Steamed Coffee. 

The same proportions as in the preceding rule. Place 
the coffee-pot in a kettle of boiling water, or make the 
coffee in a granite double boiler kept expressh' for that 
purpose, and steam twent}' minutes. Pour it from the 
grounds into a hot coffee-pot for serving. 

Coffee made with Cold Water. — Put the required propor- 
tion of cold water and coffee into a china or granite coffee- 
pot, cover closel}^, and let it stand over night. In the 
morning let it just come to the boiling-point, and serve at 
once. J"-: needs no straining nor clearing. {Miss Devereux.) 

Coffee made with an Egg. 

One egg is sufficient to clear one cup of ground coffee. If 
a smaller quantity be desired, half an egg may be used, as, 
if fresh, the remainder will keep till the next day. Or the 
whole Qgg ma}' be beaten with the ground coffee, and such 
portion of it used as is needed, keeping the remainder 
closely covered. 

To make the coffee., add half a cup of cold water to the 
portion of egg to be used and one third of a cup of coffee. 



ii6 The Boston Cook Book. 

Beat well ; put it in the hot coffee-pot ; add one pint of 
boiling water and boil five minutes. Keep it hot, but not 
boiling, for ten minutes. Pour out a little <ind pour it 
back to clear the spout. 

FUtered Coffee. 

This is made in a French biggin, or an}" double coffee- 
pot fitted with one or more strainers. The coffee, which 
is ground ver}" fine, is placed in the strainer ; this is put 
into the receptacle for holding the made coffee, the boiling 
water is poured in and allowed to drip slowly through the 
coffee. If there be onh^ two parts to it, the coffee-pot 
should stand where the coffee will keep hot, but not boil. 
Many of the coffee-pots made on this principle are placed 
in another vessel containing boiling water. 

To serve Coffee. 

Cream ^ scalded milk, and block sugar are essential to good 
breakfast coffee. Put in one tablespoonful of cream and tivo 
tablespoon/ids of 7nilk, and fill the cup three fourths full. 
Never fill to overflowing. Let each person add the sugar 
desired, unless 3'ou know the individual tastes of the fiim- 
ily. The milk should be just hot, but never boiled, as 
boiled milk gives a ver}- unpleasant flavor. 

After-dinner coffee^ or black coffee^ is made b}' either of 
the receipts previouslj' given, using double the proportion 
of coffee : two heaping tablespoonfuls of coffee to one cup of 
water. It sliould be very strong and perfectl}' clear ; served 
in small cups, with block sugar if desired, but not with 
cream or milk, as the milk counteracts the purpose for 
which the coffee is taken. 

The addition of three tablespoonfuls of whipped cream to a 
cup of coffee gives Vienna Coffee. An equal amount of 
boiled milk and filtered coffee is called Cafe au Lait. 

Cocoa and Chocolate. 
Cocoa is the fruit of a small tree which grows in Mexico, 
Central America, and the West Indies. The fruit is shaped' 



Cocoa, 117 

like a large, thick cucumber, and contains from six to 
thirt}' beans. The beans are roasted, like coffee. The 
husks or shells are taken off, and used in that form as 
cocoa shells. The}' need longer boiling, and are preferred 
b}- many persons with weak digestion. The}' are some- 
times ground with the bean, making an inferior article of 
cocoa. Starch is also used to adulterate cocoa. The best 
cocoa is made from the whole bean after the husk is re- 
moved. Cocoa nibs are the beans broken instead of 
ground. 

Chocolate is the finel}' ground powder from the kernels 
mixed to a stiff paste with sugar, and sometimes flavored 
with vanilla. It is the most nutritious and convenient form 
of cocoa ; a small cake of it will satisfy hunger. It is a 
ver}' good lunch for travellers. If the oily scum which 
forms on the surface after boiling be removed, it is less 
indigestible. 

Chocolate does not produce the injurious effects which 
render tea and coffee objectionable, and is far better for 
children and working-people. 

Cocoa. 
Put half a cup of broken cocoa into a pot with tivo quarts 
of water. Boil genth" two hours, until reduced to one 
quart ; or use half cocoa and half shells. Serve with sugar 
and cream ^ or scalded milk. It is more digestible if allowed 
to cool and the globules of fat removed, then reheated. 

Prepared Cocoa. 
This ground cocoa comes in man}' forms, and some are 
recommended to be prepared at the table ; but all kinds 
are better boiled one minute in a very little water, the same 
as chocolate, and thinned with hot milk. 

SheUs. 
Steep one cup of shells in 07ie quart of boiling water three 
or four hours, adding more hot water as it boils away, 
Strain, and serve with hot milk, or cream and sugar. 



ii8 The Boston Cook Book. 



Chocolate. 

Put one square of Baker's chocolate, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, two tablespoonfuls of hot water, and a pinch of salt in 
a small saucepan, and boil until smooth ; stir constantl}' ; 
add graduall}' one pint of boiling water, and when read}' to 
serve add one pint of hot milk. Use all milk and two squares 
of chocolate, if liked richer ; or thicken with one teaspoon-^ 
ful of cornstarch wet in a little cold water, and boil five min- 
utes before adding the milk. 

German, or Sweetened Vanilla Chocolate. 

Melt two sticks of chocolate in two or three tablespoonfuls of 
hot water. Stir to a smooth paste ; add graduallj' one pint 
of hot milk and stir or mill it five minutes. Serve in cups 
three quarters full with two or three tablespoonfuls of whipped 
cream on the top. Sweeten and flavor the cream before 
whipping. 

Hot Milk. 

Heat the milk over boiling water until it is barely hot, 
but not scalded. Test the heat by tasting. Shake in a 
few grains of salt, and sip it by the teaspoonful. One of 
the best " nightcap drinks." 

Lemonade. 

Boil one cup of sugar and one pint of water ten minutes ; 
add thin shavings of the yellow peel of one lemon, and 
pour it hot over the juice of three lemons. When cold, 
strain it, and add chipped ice and water as desired. 

Fruit Punch. 

Boil two cups of sugar and one quart of water twenty 
minutes. Pour it boiling hot over the following mixture : 
half a cup each of lemon and orange juice, one cup of 
strawberry juice, half a cup 'of canned cherry syrup, 
and one cup of chopped pineapple. AVhen ready to 
serve, strain it, dilute with ice water, and add one cup 
of fresh strawberries quartered, one banana sliced, and 
half a cup stoned cherrirs. Dilute with ApoUinaris if 
preferred. 



Soup, 119 



SOUP. 

Nothing can be easier than to make a good soup if 
one only knows how and has the will to do it ; and if one 
will, it is eas}' to know how. Considerations of econ- 
omy and healthfulness make it the dut}- of ever^^ house- 
keeper to thoroughl}' inform herself on the few essential 
points in soup-making. When these are learned it will 
be as simple as an}^ other dut}'. 

As soups are 7iot made from nothing^ a supply' of mate- 
rials should always be kept on hand, such as dried sweet 
herbs (which ma}' be purchased at any citj^ market for a 
trifle ; twenty-five cents' worth will last a year or more) ; 
also whole^ as well as ground spices; and, more particu- 
larl}', fresh vegetables, — onions^ carrots^ and turnips. If 
we had access to the French market, we could buy the 
smallest amount whenever it might be desired ; but as 
onl}' a few marketmen in America will sell a single onion 
or a single carrot, it is well for those who cannot cultivate 
for themselves to purchase in large quantities. They 
ma}' be kept in a cool place by covering with clean sand. 
Parsley ma}' be grown in the house if you have a sunny 
window ; and we can all have salt and pepper. Now, 
having these seasoning materials always at hand, you 
may easily find other material in the store-room, or from 
the day's supply of fresh meat, fish, etc., without buying 
expressly for soup ; that is, if you, instead of the market- 
man, have the bones and trimmings. 

Every pantry should have a " catch all." It is vastly 
more important there than in the sewing-room or on the 
toilet- table. The coal-hod, refuse pail, and sink catch all 
in many households. One or two large bowls — not tin, 
but deep earthen dishes, provided they are sw?et and do

not leak — will better answer the purpose. After breakfast 
or dinner, do not put away the remnants of steaks or 
roasts on the platters, but look them over and put bV 
themselves an}' pieces that can be used again, either cold 
or in what are called made dishes. Then put all the bones, 
trimmings, fat, gristle, and ever\-thing, especialh' the 
platter grav}', which usuall}' flaA'ors the dish-water, into 
the " catch all." If 3'ou have just one bone from a steak 
or chop, if it be not burned it is worth saving, and in cool 
weather will keep till jou have another. If there be a 
tablespoonful of an}' vegetables, a stalk of celer}', an ^gg, 
baked apple, or a bit of macaroni, put them away neatly. 
You will find a use for them. If 3'ou have boiled a fresh 
tongue, a fowl, a leg of lamb, or a cup of rice, plan to 
make a soup also, and thus save the water. This economy 
may be carried to the extreme of saving the water in which 
cabbages, beans, or potatoes have been boiled, or of keep- 
ing a fire several hours in a hot da}' only to save a few 
cents' worth of bone, or of spoiling all the soup by adding 
a spoonful of turnip already sour ; but as a rule we err in 
the opposite practice. 

Soups are made from meat, fish, and vegetables, with 
water or milk ; seasoned or flavored with any or every 
kind of vegetable, sweet herbs, spices, curry powder, 
catchups, aromatic sauces, and with some kinds of fruit. 
They are served thin and clear, or thickened with vegeta- 
bles or cereals, and with or without meat. 

Soups are classified and named in various ways, accord- 
ing to material, color, quality, etc. Soups loith stock have 
meat as the basis. Soups luithout stock are made of fish, 
vegetables, and milk. They are sometimes called soup 
maigre. Soups are named from the principal ingredient, 
or an imitation of the same, as Potato, Onion, Beef, 
Mutton, Chicken, Gumbo, Macaroni, Okra, Ox-tail, Gib- 
let, Cock-a-leekie, Lobster, Mock Turtle, Mock Bisque, 
etc. ; or from the color, as Clear, or Amber, Brown, and 
White ; or from the consistency, as Thin soups and Purees ; 
or from the quality, as simple Broths, Bouillon, and Con- 



Stock. 121 



somme ; or from the season of the year, as Julienne ; 
or from the people who use them, as Scotch Broth, French 
Pot-au-feu, Indian Mullagatawne3' ; or from the name of 
the makers, or in an}' wa}' one's fanc}' and invention may 
suggest. But from the scores, 3-es, hundreds of receipts 
in the cook-books, which seem so bewildering to the be- 
ginner, a few simple rules may be deduced which will 
make the process of soup-making intelligible ; and wh(m 
once the foundation is laid, 3'ou may build and enlarge as 
you choose. 

Do not be discouraged because 3'Ou have not all tlie 
dozen or more ingredients mentioned in most receipts. 
You will find man}- of them may be omitted with a per- 
fectl3' satisfactor3' result. Much depends upon tvhat is 
omitted, though, as Potage a la Reine without chicken, or 
Julienne without vegetables, or Mullagatawne3- without 
curr3' powder, would disappoint those who think onl3' 
of the name ; but, called b3' an3' other name, 30U would 
find them ver3' good soups. 

Soups with Stock. 

Soups made with stock include all the varieties made 
from beef, veal, mutton, and poultry. Perhaps a glance 
at the meaning of the word stock will make clear its appli- 
cation to cooker3'. Stock is from the Anglo-Saxon stician, 
to stick, and the idea of fixedness is expressed in all its 
forms. Stock in trade or business means the mone3' or 
material laid In*, or stored, stocked, fixed, as a source of 
supply, read3' for use at an3' time ; and in the business 
of soup-making, stock is the material stored or prepared 
in such a wa3' that it ma3^ be kept or fixed for use in 
making different kinds of meat soup ; or, more definitely, 
it is a liquid containing the juices and soluble parts of 
meat, bone, and vegetables, which have been extracted 
b3' proper cooking. This liquid is more or less solid when 
cold, according to the gelatinous nature of the ingredients. 
It varies greatly in qualitA', owing to the manner in which 
it is prepared and the material used. 



122 The Boston Cook Book. 

Stock is usually made from the cheaper, interior parts 
of meat, Avhich yield the most nutriment when cooked in 
this wa}' ; also from odds and ends of cooked meat, 
which perhaps could not be used otherwise. The chief 
object in making stock is to obtain in the quickest manner 
the largest possible amount of nutriment from the cheap- 
est parts of meat, and after getting it to keep and use it. 
This is best accomplished by observing the following- 
rules : — 

First. Cut the meat into small pieces, and soak them 
in cold water before heating, that every atom of nourish- 
ment may be extracted. Cold water draws out and 
dissolves the meat juices, while hot water hardens the 
albumen on the outside of the meat and prevents the 
juices from escaping into the liquid. 

Second. Use a careful selection and proportion of meat, 
bone, and water, and season judicioush', so that no one 
flavor will predominate. 

Third. Use a steam-tight kettle, and simmer, — not boil 
the material rapidl}', — that the juices may be retained in 
the water, and not wasted b}' evaporation. 

Fourth. Make stock the day before using, if possible, 
thsit the fat may be more easil}^ removed ; but do not give 
up making it simply from "lack of time," for it can be 
made quickh'. 

A sonp digester is the proper vessel for making stock. 
This is a porcelain-lined iron kettle with a bale, and hav 
ing a cover fitting closel}^ into a groove, so that no steam 
can escape except from the valve in the top of the cover, 
which at once indicates when the water is boiling rapidly. 
One holding six quarts, and costing three dollars, is a con- 
venient size for a small family. If you cannot afford a 
digester, get a granite ironware kettle, with a tightly fit- 
ting cover. Plain ironware will do if you have nothing 
better; but it rusts easily, and, if tin-hned, the tin melts 
in careless usage. 

The meats used in making stock should contain gelatine^ 
osmazome, and a small amount of fat. 



Stock. 123 

Gelatine is found in the bones, skin, tendinous andgristl} 
portions of flesli, especiall}' in veal. It is this which causes 
the stock to become a jell\-. But a soup which forms a 
jelly, or is made principall}- from bones, is not the most 
nutritious. The jelh- of bones and sinews boiled into soup 
can furnish only jell}- for our bones and sinews. It is use- 
ful in convalescence, for then the portions of the sj'stem in 
which gelatine is needed have been wasted ; but in other 
cases, though easily digested, it is unwholesome, for it 
loads the blood with disturbing products. It is entirel}^ 
destitute of flavor, and therefore we need with it meat con- 
taining osmazome. 

Osmazome is that part of meat which gives to each of the 
various kinds its distinctive flavor. It is more abundant 
in brown than in white meats, and in the meat of old 
rather than in that of young animals. It is found largely 
in lean beef, mutton, and fowls. Osmazome is more highly 
developed in roasted meals ; therefore all the bones and 
remnants of roasts which cannot be utilized in entrees^ 
should be put into the soup-kettle. 

We need also the alkaline and acid salts found in the 
blood and juices of the flesh ; therefore a small portion of 
raw, lean meat should form a part of all stock. 

Fat is necessary, as an element of perfect food, and 
should always be used in making stock. It adds to the 
flavor, and all that is not absorbed in the stock may be re- 
moved when cold. The mai-row, found in the shin bone, 
is the best form of fat. The browned fat of roast beef 
gives a fine flavor, and occasionally a bit of ham or bacon 
may be used. But all mutton fat should be avoided, be- 
cause of its rankness. 

These four kinds of meat — beef, mutton, veal, and poul- 
try — may be used together or separately. It is better to 
use mutton, if in a large quantity, by itself, as the flavor 
is disagreeable to many. After having extracted all the 
nutriment from the meat in its juices, fat, albumen, and 
flavor, do not attempt to make further use of the worthless 
residue of muscular fibre. It is not only harmful, but dry. 



124 The Boston Cook Booh 

tasteless, and utterl}' useless as food. It needs the addi- 
tion of many other materials to make it palatable even, 
and it is cheaper to get the fi brine we need from meat 
cooked in other ways, directions for which will be given 
under Boiling Meats and Stews. Therefore do not hesi- 
tate, as a matter of economy, to throw away this useless 
meat. 

When fresh meat is bought expressly for stock, select ? 
piece from the shin or lower part of the round of beef or 
veal. This has bone with marrow, a large proportion ot 
gelatine, more or less osmazome, according to the amount 
of flesh, and costs less than other parts. In mutton, pieces 
from the neck and forequarter are the best. Fowls are 
better than chickens. With this fresh meat ma}- be used 
the bones and trimmings from steak or chops, and the 
flank ends of roasting pieces, which yield more nutriment 
if added to the stock pot before being cooked. Add also 
any remnants of roasted or broiled meat, bone, fat, gristle, 
an3'thing except mutton fat. In families where large roasts 
of beef and poultrj^ are often used, there should be mate- 
rial enough for stock, without buying new meat, except for 
the nicest of clear soups, which the French call Consomme. 

The proportions of bone and meat should be about equal 
by weight. W^hen read}' to begin the stock, wipe the fresh 
meat with a clean cloth wet in cold water. Never put 
the meat in a pan of cold water to soak. It takes out all 
the juices that 30U wish to save. Wijje before cutting. The 
inside is clean. But rinse the cloth and scrub the outside 
thoroughly. Cut away the parts that are tainted or dis- 
colored b}' rusty meat-hooks, etc. Examine all the odds 
and ends of cooked meat, and remove any smoked or 
burned parts from ham or broiled meat, also the stulliug 
and skin from roast poultry, if you wish to have the stock 
clear. Scrape the meat clean from the bones and cut into 
inch pieces. Break or saw the bones as small as you con- 
veniently can. Remove the marrow (a soft, fatty sub- 
stance, which you will find in the hollow of the bones) and 
put it in the soup kettle to keep the bones from sticking. 



Stock, 1 2 5 

Put in the bones and pack the meat around them. Place 
your kettle on the back of the range before adding the 
water, so that there need be no heav}' weight to lift. Allow 
one quart of fresh cold water to every pound of meat and 
bone ; one fourth less water if 3'our stock is to be made 
altogether of cooked meats, or if 3'ou use a digester. Cover 
the kettle, and after the water is quite red, and the juices 
are well drawn out, draw the kettle forward and let it heat 
slowh', and simmer^ or boil slowl}^, but never boil hard. 

The scum, which soon rises on the surface, is the albu- 
men and juices of the meat which have been drawn out 
and mixed with the cold water. They coagulate, or har- 
den, as the water heats, and, being lighter than the water, 
rise to the surface in the form of scum. It has usuall}'' 
been considered essential, in making soup, to remove ever}^ 
particle of this scum ; but the practice is whoU}- unnecessary 
and wasteful. We learn, in the article on Boiling, the 
three distinct purposes and methods of cooking meat in 
water ; and yet in skimming a soup we act direct^ con- 
trar}' to the general principle there explained. If the kettle 
be clean, the water pure, and the meat well cleansed from 
any impurities on its outer surface, what can there be in 
the meat not suitable to eat, any more than in roast beef, 
or steak, or boiled mutton ? In making beef tea we are 
directed b}' the highest scientific authorities to remove the 
fat, cut the meat small, soak it in cold water, heat gradu- 
all3% and never skim, as the scum or thickened material in 
the water is the ver}' thing desired. Soup is only another 
form of beef tea, and the fat which is objectionable can 
better be removed when the stock is cold. These juices 
and soluble parts of the meat should be retained ; the}' 
increase, rather than diminish, the flavor, and all the sedi 
ment which is fine enough to go through clie strainer 
should be used. In any thickened soup it is so mingled 
with the other ingredients as not to be unpleasant to the 
ej'^e. And for those who wish clear soups, which are not 
as nutritious, iihis sediment can easil}^ be removed in the 
clearing. 



126 The Boston Cook Book, 

In a criticisui wbicli so decidedly rejects a prevailing 
custom, it may be well to remark that the method of pre- 
paring soups which is recommended in the preceding 
paragraph has been successfully proved in the Boston 
Cooking School for the last three years. The French, who 
regard skimming as very important in making their Pot- 
au-feu^ remove the meat as soon as tender, and serve it as 
bouilli^ or boiled heef. As it has not been cut in small 
pieces, and is heated quickly, some of the juices are re- 
tained in the meat, and it is nourishing and palatable. 
Their Pot-au-feu is more like our beef stew than like soup 
stock. 

In the preparation of the stock, the next step is to add 
the seasoning, which ma}' be used in these proportions : 
For every quart of water, one even teaspoonful of salt, two 
•peppercorns or half a saltspoonful of gioimd pepper, two 
cloves, two allspice berries, one fourth of a saltspoonful of 
celery seed or a bit of celery root, a sprig of parsley, a 
teaspoonful of mixed herbs, and a tablenpoonful of each 
vegetable. 

Herbs and spices are better whole than ground, as thev 
ma}" be more readil}" removed by straining. The French 
cooks use a bouquet of herbs, made with two leaves or 
blossoms of each herb wrapped in a sprig of parsley and 
tied securely so that it ma}" be easily removed. A con- 
venient and economical way is to strip off the leaves and 
blossoms, break the stalks in tiny pieces, mix them, and 
keep in a tin box. Use sage, summer savory, thyme, marjo- 
ram, and bay leaves: a teaspoonful of the mixture (not 
of each herb) for every quart. The vegetables generally 
used are onion, carrot, turnip, and celery. It is better to 
omit them entirely in warm weather, or if you wish to 
keep the stock more than a week, as the vegetable juices 
ferment quickly and sour the stock. 

Wash, scrape, or i)are the vegetables ; cut them into 
small pieces for convenience in measuring, as one onion 
or one slice of carrot is rather indefinite^ Keep them 
in cold water until the juices are drawn from the meat. 



Stoeh. 127 



When old or strong, the}^ ma}' be blanched or parboiled 
first. 

Onions, potatoes, and cabbage should alwaj's be scalded 
to draw out the indigestible qualities. Some object to the 
use of onions, particularly' on account of the disagreeable 
odor ; but when added with the other seasoning material, 
they are so completely absorbed in .the stock that no 
trace of their presence can be detected. All or part of the 
vegetables may be fried first, if you like. One or two 
sour apples give a pleasant flavor to stock. Wines or 
catchups should be added just before serving, as boiling 
dissipates the flavor. 

If 3'ou wish to have a darJc brown stock, reserve part of 
the lean meat to Ijrown with the onions. Fr}' the onions 
in a little fat, and when ver}- brown remove them, to pre- 
vent burning, and brown the meat in the same fat. Add 
the onions and meat to the stock. Take a little water 
from the stock, and wash off^^ all the browned glaze ad- 
hering to the frying-pan, as this is the best part. A table- 
spoonful of browned sugar or caramel (see page 134), 
which should alwa3'S be kept on hand, will also give a 
rich dark color. After the seasaning is placed in the 
mixture, put the kettle where it will keep at a gentle, 
stead}' simmering. Do not let it boil furioush' one half- 
hour and not at all the next, but find the place on the 
range where it will keep at just the right temperature, and 
then, if 3'ou have a stead}' fire, it will need no furthei 
attention until ready to strain. It is hot enough if the 
water just bubbles on one side of the kettle. 

When the stock has simmered till the meat is in rags 
and the bones clean, strain at once. Do not let it stand, 
if in an iron kettle. If you have used a digester or steam- 
tight kettle, the water will not have lessened much. If 
boiled in an ordinary kettle, it will be reduced about one 
half by evaporation, and may be diluted when ready for 
the table. Strain in this way. Place a stone jar beside 
your kettle. It should be of a size suited to the amount 
of stock. Put a colander over the jar (it should fit inside 



128 The Boston Cook Booh, 

it), and a strainer clotli over the colander. Then, with 
a ladle or dipper, dip the contents of the kettle and pour 
into the strainer. Never try to lift the kettle and pour 
it out, unless you have more strength and skill than most 
beginners. AVhen you have only a pint left, you may try 
the pouring. Do not squeeze the cloth, but let the con- 
tents drain ten or fifteen minutes, then throw the scraps 
away. Remember that you have extracted all the nutri- 
ment, and have it in the water ; so do not expect to have 
any virtue in the meat or vegetables. Set the jar in a 
cool place, uncovered, but not in the ice chest while hot. 
It keeps better to cool quickly. In cold weather, and if 
you have used a large proportion of bone, the stock will 
harden like jelly, with a cake of solid fat on the top. This 
fat, by excluding the air, helps to keep the stock, and 
should not be removed until the stock is needed. In 
winter stock will keep a week, and longer, if made without 
vegetables. It should be heated occasionally to the boil- 
ing-point, or after taking off any portion of it, that what 
remains may harden again in an unbroken form. A little 
fresh charcoal tied in a bag and boiled with the stock is 
said to restore it when only slightly changed. 

In very warm weather, make only enough for each da}', 
as sometimes it spoils in one night. If 3'ou wish to make 
a soup while the stock is still hot, put what portion 3^ou 
may need into a shallow pan and place the pan in ice 
water, with a larger pan of ice w^ater over it. This will 
soon harden the fat ; or if 3'ou have not time to do this, 
take off what fat 3'ou can with a spoon, and wipe off the 
remainder with soft tissue paper, or strain several times 
through a fine nai)kin. The grease will adhere to the 
napkin, which should be rinsed in cold water. That 
hardens the fat. Or you may let the soup boil gently, 
and nearly all can be taken off. 

To remove the fat after the stock has jellied, rim a knife 
around between the cake of fat and the jar. If the fat be 
solid, it will sometimes come off whole ; but if soft, take 
off all you can without cutting into the jelly, then wring 



Clearing Stock. 129 



a cloth out of veiy hot water, and wipe the stock. The 
hot cloth will absorb the fat readil3\ Remember, if the 
soup is to be served clear, not a pin-head of fat must be 
left ; but if it is to be thickened with any starchy material, 
this will absorb what cannot be removed with a spoon. 
This fat must be saved and clarified according to direc- 
tions on page 18. 

With this stock for a foundation, you may make an 
endless variety of soups, each soup taking its name from 
the principal solid ingredient ; and it is equally valuable to 
use, instead of water, in making gravies or sauces. No 
matter how little you have, one cupful is worth more than 
it costs to make it, as an addition to fricassees and braised 
meats. This stock, if properly made and strained, will be 
sufficiently clear for any common soups. But for clear 
sparkling soups and aspic jelly, it must be clarified with the 
white of an egg. 



To clear Soup Stock. 

Remove the fat, and allow the white and shell of oiie egg 
for every quart of stock. If you wish to flavor the stock 
more highl}', add half a salt spoonful of celery seed and the 
thinnest possible shavings from the rind of half a lemon.^ 
Add also the lemon juice, and more salt and pepper if 
needed. Mix celery seed, lemon, egg. etc. with the cold 
stock, and beat it well. If the stock be hot when the egg 
is a:Med, the egg will harden before it has done its work. 
This is a point where man}^ fail. Set it over the fire and 
stir it all the time, until it is hot, to keep the egg from 
settling. Then leave it, and let it boil ten minutes. By 
this time a thick scum will have formed, and as it breaks 
the liquid will be clear and sparkling, like wine, and darker 
than before. Draw it back on the stove, and add half a 
cup of cold water. Let it stand ten minutes, while 3'ou 
get 3'our jar, jcolander, and fine napkin read}' for straining. 
Wring your napkin out of hot water, and lay it over the 
colander. Put the finest wire strainer on the napkin and 
then pour it all through. This strainer will catch the scum 

1 Clear soup should be highly seasoned, as clearing destroys some of the 
strength. 



I30 The Boston Cook Book. 

and shells which would otherwise clog the napkin. Let it 
take its own time to drain ; but if you must hasten it, raise 
the napkin first at one corner, and then at another, and let 
the liquid run down to a clean place. This is better than 
squeezing. This is all ready to serve as a clear soup b}' 
simply heating to the boiling-point. Serve with it, in the 
tureen, thin slices of lemon, a glass of sherr}^ 3'olks of 
hard-boiled eggs, or delicate flavored force-meat balls ; or 
put on each plate a. poached egg, or a spoonful of grated 
Parmesan cheese. 

In making soups from this stock, bear this fact in mind : 
Do not waste the stock by boiling in it any material 
which requires long boiling. Vegetables, rice, sago, tapi- 
oca, macaroni, vermicelli, etc., should be cooked separatel}" 
and then added to the stock, which should be brought to 
the boiling-point. 

The following are some of the principal varieties. 
These soups are all supposed to have no meat served 
with them. The broth is clear and thin, and every particle 
of vegetable or cereal should be distinct, except in the 
soups called Mixed Vegetable and Tomato. 

Concise rules for Common Brown Stock and Consomme 
are given for the benefit of those who do not need to read 
all the preliminary remarks. 



Brown Soup Stock. 



6 pounds hiud sliiu of beef.

4 cloves. 

1 tablespoonful mixed herbs. 



Wipe and cut the meat and bones into small pieces ; 
add the water, and heat slowly ; add the seasoning, and 
simmer five hours. Boil down to three pints ; strain, 
remove the fat, and season with salt and pepper. Serve 
in cups at luncheons, evening companies, etc. Boil one 
onion, half a carrot, and half a turnip with it if 3'ou like. 



Clear, or Amber Soup, or Consomm^.^ 



4 pounds shin of beef. 

4 pounds knuckle of veal, or 

3 pounds fowl. 

4 quarts cold water. 

2 ounces lean ham or bacon. 

6 cloves. 

6 peppercorns. 

6 allspice. 

Bouquet of herbs. 



1 tablespoonful salt. 
3 onions. 
1 carrot. 

1 turnip. 

2 stalks celery. 

2 sprigs parsley. 

3 eggs, whites and shells. 
1 saltspoonful celery seed. 
Rind and juice of one lemon. 



Wipe and cut the meat and bones into small pieces. 
Put the marrow, bones, and part of the meat in the kettle 
with four quarts of cold water. Heat slowly : cut the 
onions and vegetables fine, and fiy them in the ham fat or 
in drippings ; then brown the remainder of the meat. Add 
onions, meat, herbs, spices, and vegetables. Simmer until 
the meat is in rags ; it will take seven or eight hours. 
Strain, and when cold remove the fat ; add the whites and 
shells of the eggs, celery seed, lemon, and salt and pepper 
if needed. When well mixed, heat it, and boil ten min- 
utes. Strain through the finest strainer, and heat again 
to the boiling-point before serving. Serve clear, or with 
wine or lemon. Clear soup should be perfectly transpar- 
ent, of a light brown or straw color. 

1 Consomme means " consumed, boiled to rags." 



132 The Boston Cook Book. 



Left-over Soup. 



Bones and trimmings from a 6- 

pound roast of beef. 
2 cold mutton-chops. 
The flank end of a sirloin steak, 

uncooked. 
4 quarts cold water. 
1 tablespoonf ul salt. 



4 cloves. 

4 peppercorns. 

1 cold fried egg. 

2 baked apples. 

1 cup cold boiled onions. 

2 stalks celery. 

1 tablespoonful mixed herbs. 



Cut up the meat and bones, and put them in the kettle 
with the cold water. Add all the other ingredients, and 
simmer till the bones are clean, the meat is in rags, and 
the water reduced one half. Strain, and the next morning 
remove the fat ; when read}- to serve, heat the stock to 
the boiling-point ; warm with it one cup of cold macaroni 
or tomatoes left from yesterday's dinner. Add more sea- 
soning if needed. 

Julienne Soup. 

1 quart stock. I % teaspoonful salt. 

1 pint mixed vegetables. | j^ saltspoonful pepper. 

Cut the celery into thin slices, the turnip into quarter- 
inch dice, and the carrot into three-quarters by one- 
eighth inch strips or straws, using onlv the orange part. 
Or cut carrot and turnip into quarter-inch slices, and 
then into fancy shapes with small vegetable cutters. 
Cover with boiling water, add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and cook until soft, but not long enough to destroy their 
shapes. Let the quart of stock come to a boil ; add the 
vegetables, the water, and more salt if necessary. Serve 
hot. In spring and summer use asparagus, peas, and 
string beans. It is quite important that the vegetables 
should be small and of uniform thickness ; but if any 
require a longer time to cook, they should be cut into 
smaller pieces. 



Brown Soups. 133 



Macaroni Soup. 

1 quart stock. I 1 teaspoonful salt. 

3 or 4 sticks macaroni. jo saltspoonful pepper. 

Cook the macaroni in boiling salted water, about half an 
hour, or until tender ; drain, pour cold water through it, 
to keep it from sticking together. La}- the sticks close 
together on a board, and divide them into eighth-inch 
pieces, making tin}' rings, or cut them into half-inch 
pieces. There should be about a pint of macaroni for a 
quart of stock. Bring the stock to a boil ; add the maca- 
roni, the salt, and the pepper ; then pour all into the 
tureen. 

Vermicelli Soup. 

1 quart stock. I 1 teaspoonful salt. 

1^ cup vermicelli. | }^.^ saltspoonful pepper. 

The vermicelK may be broken or not, as you please. 
Cook about ten minutes in boiling salted water. Drain, 
put it in the tureen, and pour over it the boiling stock. 
Spaghetti and Italian Paste may be used in the same way. 

Rice, Tapioca, Sago, or Barley Soup. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 



1 quart stock. 

2 tablespoonfuls either rice, bar- 
ley, tapioca, or sago. 



jo saltspoonful pepper. 



Wash the grains, and cook until tender in boiling salted 
water ; then add them to the boiling stock. Serve with 
croutons. Barley should be soaked one hour, and boiled 
two hours or more. Vegetables and macaroni are better 
with beef stock ; and rice, tapioca, and barley with mutton 
or chicken stock. 

Tomato Soup with Stock. 
1 quart stock. 1 can tomatoes. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. 1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonful pepper. 

Stew the tomatoes until soft enough to strain. Rub all 
but the seeds through the strainer. Add the sugar, salt, 



134 



The Boston Cook Book. 



and pepper. Add all to the boiling stock. Serve with 
croutons. 

Carrot, or Crecy Soup. 



1 quart rich, brown stock. 

1 pint carrot. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. 



1 teaspoonful salt. 

jo saltspoonful pepper. 

1 small onion, sliced. 



Wash and scrape the carrot ; shave off in thin slices r 
pint of the outer part. Do not use the 3'ellow centre. 
Cook the carrot with the onion in boiling salted water to 
cover, till ver}' tender. Rub the carrot through a squash 
strainer. Add the stock and heat again. Add the sugar, 
salt, and jDcpper, and when hot serve immediately with 
croutons. 

Mixed Vegetable Soup. 



1 cup strained tomatoes. 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonful pepper. 



1 quart stock. 

1 quart boiling water. 

1 cup each chopped onion, carrof, 
and celery. 

^2 cup each chopped turnip, pars- 
nip, and cabbage. 

Use all or as many varieties of vegetables as 3'ou wish, 
or if 3'ou have onl}* a few, add macaroni, rice, or barle}', 
having in all half the amount of vegetables that you have 
of liquid. Chop all the vegetables fine. Cabbage, cauli- 
flower, parsnip, potatoes, or onions should be parboiled five 
minutes, and drained carefully. Fr}' the onions and car- 
rot ; then put all with the water and stock, and simmer 
until tender. Add the seasoning. Serve without strain- 
ing. Always add sugar to all mixed vegetable soups. 

The next division of soups includes those which are 
thickened in various ways, and in wliich the meat is served 
with the soup ; also White Soups, and the materials to be 
served with soups. 

Caramel, for coloring Soups, etc. 

Melt one cup of sugar (either brown or white) witli one 
tablespoonful of water in a frying-pan. Stir until it becomes 



Soups, 135 

of a dark brown color. Add one cup o^ boiling ivater ; sim- 
mer ten miDutes, and bottle when cool. This should always 
be kept on Land, as it is useful for many purposes. It 
gives a rich, dark color to soups, coffee, and jelly ; is more 
wholesome than browned butter in sauces, and is delicious 
as a flavoring in custards and pudding sauces. 

Glaze. 

Glaze is simplv clear stock boiled down to one fourth of 
its original amount. Put two quarts of rich, strong stock 
into a saucepan, and boil it uncovered until reduced to 
one pint. It should have a gluey consistencv, and will 
keep a month if put in a closely covered jar in a cool place. 
It is useful in browning meats which have not been colored 
b}' cooking, but which we wisli to have the appearance of 
having been roasted or browned. 

Thickening for Soups. 

Soups are thickened with flour, cornstarch, or rice flour : 
one tablespoonful for a quart of soup, — heaping, if flour ; 
scant, if rice flour or cornstarch. Flour is the cheapest, 
but cornstarch gives a smoother consistenc}'. Mix the 
flour with a very little cold water or milk until it is a smooth 
paste ; then add more liquid, until it can be poured easilj^ 
into the hoiliug soup. Remember to boil the soup fifteen 
or twenty minutes after the thickening is added, that there 
ma}' be no raw taste of the flour. Where butter and flour 
are used, the butter is rubbed to a bream, mixed or braided 
with the flour, and then made into a paste with a htUe of 
the soup. 

A better wa}' is to put the butter in a small saucepan, 
and when melted and bubbling stir in the flour quickly, 
until smooth (be careful not to brown butter for any 
white soup) ; then add gradualh' about a cup of the hot 
soup, letting it boil and thicken as you add the soup. It 
should be thin enough to pour. In vegetable soups or 
purees, as soon as the hot butter and flour are blended* 



136 The Boston Cook Booh. 

the}' ma}' be stirred at once into the soup. This is what is 
meant in many of the receipts b}' thickening with butter 
and flour whicli have been cooked together. Tlie hot ])ut- 
ter cooks the flour more thoroughly than it can be cooked 
in any other way. When a brown thickening is desired, 
as in Mock Turtle Soup, melt the butter and let it become 
as brown as it will without burning ; then add all the 
flour at once and stir quickly, that every particle of it 
may be moistened in the hot butter ; add the water or 
soup gradually-. 

Flour that is browned while dry, either in the oven or 
over the fire, colors, but does not fliicken. A certain 
amount of moisture, of either fat or water, is necessar}' 
with the heat to thoroughh' swell the grains of starch in 
the flour. Thickened soups should be about the consist- 
enc}' of good cream. Purees are thicker. 

Material to be served with Soup. 

Croutons, or Fried Bread. No. 1. — Cut stale bread into 
half-inch slices, remove the crusts, and cut into half-inch 
cubes ; put them in a frying-basket, plunge into fat hot 
enough to brown them while you count forty ; drain and 
sprinkle with salt. The}' may be fried at any time and 
heated in the oven just before serving. They are espe- 
cially nice with pea and bean soup. 

No. 2. — Cut the bread into cubes, and brown in butter 
in an omelet pan ; or butter first, then cut into cubes and 
brown in the oven. They are best when prepared after 
the first receipt. 

Crisped Crackers. — Split butter crackers and spread with 
butter ; put them, the buttered side up, into a pan, and 
brown in a hot oven. They are delicious with w^hite or 
vegetable soups, and in fish chowder and oyster stews. 

Egg Balls. 

BoWfo^ir egr/s twenty minutes; put them in cold water. 
When cool, cut carefully through the white, and remove 



Soiq^s. 137 

the 3'olks whole. TLey may be served in the soup whov*? 
or cut into quarters. Or put the 3'olks in a small bowl 
and rub them to a paste with a wooden spoon. Season 
with one saltspoonfal of salt ; one fourth of a sab.spoonful 
oi pepper ; one teaspoonfuL of melted butter. Moisten it with 
the beaten yolk or white of one raw egg^ using just enough 
to shape it easily into balls about the size of a walnut 
Roll in flour and fry in butter ; the same as force-me«5t 
balls. They are sometimes boiled five minutes in the soup, 
but are better fried. 

Force-Meat Balls for Soup, 
i cup of any cooked meat. Yolk of 1 raw egg. 



I saltsp. each of salt and thyme. 

}.2 saltspoonf ul pepper. 

1 teaspoonf ul lemon juice. 

1 teaspoonful cliopped parsley. 



A few drops onion juice. 
1 tablespoonf ul flour. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 



Chop the meat very fine ; add the seasoning ; beat the 
yolk of the Qgg, and add enough of it to moisten the meat ; 
make it into balls the size of a nutmeg, put them in a soup 
plate, sprinkle them with flour, shake the plate until the 
balls are all floured ; put the butter in an omelet pan, and 
when brown put in the balls, and shake the pan occasion- 
all v until the balls are browned. 



Mock Turtle Soup. 



1 calf's head. 

4 quarts cold water. 

1 tablespoonful salt. 
6 cloves. 

6 peppercorns. 

6 allspice. 

i.< inch stick cinnamon. 

Bouquet of herbs. 

2 onions. 



1 carrot. 

1 turnip. 
Celery root. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 
1 pint brown stock. 

3 eggs. 

1 lemon. 



Wash, scrape, and clean the head, and soak an hour in 
cold water. Remove the brains and tongue. Lay them 



138 The Boston Cook Book. 

in cold water, to be reserved for separate dishes. Cut the 
head into four or five pieces, and put it into the kettle with 
the skin side up, to prevent sticking. Add the cold water ; 
heat slowly and skim thoroughly, as the meat is to be used 
again. Add the salt, and simmer two hours, or until the 
meat slips from the bones. Remove the meat, and put 
the face meat smoothl}' on a plate, so it can easily be cut 
into dice when cool. Reserve the remainder of the meat 
for force-meat balls. Put the bones on to boil again. 
Add the herbs, spices, and vegetables, and simmer until 
reduced to two quarts. Strain, and set away to cool. 
Half an hour before serving, remove the fat, put the stock 
on to boil, and season with one saltspoonful each of ground 
th3'me or marjoram and pepper, and one teaspoonful of salt. 
Make a brown thickening with two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
browned, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch or flour, and 
one pint of brown stock. Stir this into the stock. Add 
one cup of meat dice, made b}' cutting the face meat into 
half-inch cubes. Boil the three eggs twent3' minutes, and 
make the 3'olks into egg balls, or cut the whole eggs in 
half-inch slices. Make force-meat balls with the reserved 
meat, according to directions on page 137. Put the meat 
balls and egg balls into the tureen, add the soup, and serve 
very hot with thin slices of lemon. 

This is usually flavored with a glass of sherry wine, but 
is ver}' good with onl}' the lemon, or a tablespoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce. Or 3'ou may boil with it one i)int 
of strained tomatoes. 

If 3'Ou have no brown stock, boil one pound of lean beef 
with the head, and use the head stock with the flour and 
butter thickening. This soup is often made from calf's 
feet, and one or two pounds of lean veal. The feet should 
be soaked and scalded, boiled in four quarts of water with 
the herbs, spices, and vegetables, until the water is reduced 
to two quarts. Strain, and use as directed in the first 
receipt, making force-meat l)alls of the veal, and meat 
dice from the gelatinous meat of the feet. 



Soups, 139 



Ox-Tail Soup. 



2 ox-tails. 

1 large onion. 

1 tablespoonful beef drippings. 

4 quarts cold water. 



1 tablespoonful salt. 

1 tablespoonful mixed herbs. 

4 cloves. 

4 peppercorns. 



Wash and cut up the ox-tails, separating them at the 
joints. Cut the onion fine and fiy it in the hot beef drip- 
pings. When slightly browned, draw the onion to one side 
of the pan, and brown half of the ox-tails. Put the fried 
onion and ox-tails in the soup kettle, and cover with four 
quarts of cold water. Tie the cloves, peppercorns, and 
herbs in a small piece of strainer cloth, and add them to 
the soup. Add the salt, and simmer three or four hours, 
or until the meat separates from the bones, and the gristly 
portions are perfectly soft. Select some of the nicest 
joints to serve with the soup. Skim off the fat, and add 
more salt and pepper, if needed. Strain and serve very hot. 

If vegetables are served with this soup, add one pint of 
mixed vegetables, — onion, carrot, turnip, and celery. Cut 
them into small pieces, or into fancj' shapes with a vege^ 
table cutter. Add them to the liquor after straining, and 
boil twenty minutes or until tender. 

Mullagatawny Soup. 

This is an Indian soup, and means " pepper pot." It 
can be made from veal, calfs head, chicken, or rabbit. 
Use one, or a mixture of two or more of these varieties 
of meat. Mullagatawny soup should always be very highly 
seasoned with onions, curr}^ powder, and apples, or lemons, 
or some strong acid fruit. The best portions of the meat 
are usually removed as soon as tender, and served with the 
strained soup. Eice should also be served with this soup. 



3 pounds chicken, or young fowl. 

1 pound veal bones. 

2 onions. 

1 tablespoonful beef drippings. 

4 cloves. 

4 peppercorns. 



2 sour apples, or 

The juice of 1 lemon. 

4 quarts cold water. 

1 tablespoonful curry powder 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. 



I40 



The Boston Cook Book. 



Clean the chicken, and cut it at the joints into nice 
pieces for serving. Put it in the soup kettle with tlie veal 
bones, or any pieces of veal 3^ou may have. Cover with 
four quarts of cold water. SUce the onions, and fty them 
brown in the beef drippings. Put the onions, cloves, pep- 
percorns, and apples in the kettle. Mix the curry powder, 
salt, and sugar to a smooth paste with a little of the water ; 
add it to the soup. Let the soup simmer until the chicken 
Is tender. Remove the chicken and cut into small pieces. 
Put the bones back in the kettle, and simmer another hour. 
Strain the soup, remove the fat, and put the liquor on to 
boil again, with the pieces of chicken and three or four 
tablespoonfuls of boiled rice. When the chicken is hot, 
serve at once. 



Scotch Brotn. 



}4 cup pearl barley. 
2 pounds neck of mutton. 
2 quarts cold water. 
1^ cup each of carrot, turnip, on- 
ion, and celery. 



2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

1 tablespoonf ul flour. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

1 saltspoonful white pepper. 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 



Pick over, and soak the barley over night or several 
hours in cold water. Wipe the meat with a clean wet 
cloth. Remove the fat and skin. Scrape the meat from 
the bones and cut it into half-inch dice. Put the bones on 
to boil in one pint of cold water, and the meat in three 
pints of cold water. Let the latter boil quicklv, and skim 
carefully just as it begins to boil. When the scum comes 
up white, add the liarley and skim again. Cut the vege- 
tables into quarter-inch dice, fry them five minutes in 
one tablespoonful of the butter, and add them to the meat. 
Simmer three or four liours, or until the meat and barle}^ 
are tender. Strain the water in which tlie bones have sim- 
mered. Cook one tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan 
with one tablespoonful of Hour. When smooth, add the 
strained water gradually, and stir into the broth. Add 
the salt, pepper, and pnrslev. Simmer ten minutes, and 
serve without straining. Mauj' people have a prejudice 



Broth, 141 



against mutton in stews or broths. The strong, disagree^ 
able flavor lies mostl}- in the skin. If this be removed 
together with the fat, it will repay one for the time and 
trouble. As this broth is not to be strained, it is always 
well to boil the bones separately. Care must be taken not 
io let the water boil awa}'. This is a favorite dish among 
the Scotch. The}' often serve it with a larger proportion ot 
vegetables. The carrots are sometimes grated, giving the 
broth a fine color, and sometimes the dice of meat are first 
browned in the butter. Rice ma}" be used instead of bar- 
ley. Scotch broth made after this receipt has been tested 
by a native Scotchman, and pronounced more hke the 
*' auld countree " than any other dish eaten in America. 



Mutton Broth. 

Allow one quart of cold water to each pound of meat and 
bone. Break the bones and cut the meat (which should 
be lean) into small pieces. Cover with cold water and 
heat slowly. Add one teaspoonfid of salt and half a salt- 
spoonf id o^ pepper^ and a small slice of onion and turnip if 
you like. Simmer until the meat is in shreds. Strain it, 
and when it is cool remove the fat. To one quart of the 
broth allow tioo tablespoonfnls of rice^ washed and soaked 
half an hour. When the Ifi'oth is boiling, add the rice ; 
simmer until it is tender, being careful not to let the water 
boil away. Season, and serve at once. For seasoning, 
a little curry powder, used as you would use cayenne 
pepper, or a saltspoonful of celery salt, or a few leaves of 
fresh mint, are agreeable as a change. 

When you have not time to cool the broth, a piece of 
soft tissue paper passed over the surface helps to take up 
any globules of fat which cannot be removed with a spoon. 
To make it quickly for a sick person, chop one pound of 
perfectly lean, juicy mutton very fine ; pour over it one pint 
of cold water. Let it stand until the water is very red ; 
then heat it slowly. Let it simmer ten minutes. Strain, 
and serve hot. 



142 The Boston Cook Book, 



Chicken Broth. 

Clean the chicken, and separate it at the joints. Re- 
move all the skin and fat. Cover the chicken with cold 
water. Add one tablespoonfid of salt^ one saltspoonfal of 
pepper, one small onion, sliced. Simmer until the chickea 
is tender. Remove the best part of the meat, and put 
the bones and gristle back and simmer until the bones are 
clean. Wash and soak two tablesjwonfuls of rice half an 
hour. Strain the broth. Remove the fat. Put the broth 
on to boil again, and add to it the rice, and the nicest 
portions of meat cut into small pieces. Simmer until the 
rice is tender. Add seasoning to taste, and serve at once. 
A few spoonfuls of cream may be added if desired. Serve 
with toasted crackers. 



Turkey Soup. 

Take the bones and scraps left from roast tiirke}' or 
chicken, or any kind of game. Scrape the meat from the 
bones, and lay aside any nice pieces, no matter how small. 
Remove all the stuffing, and keep that by itself. Break 
the bones, and pack them closely in a kettle. Cover with 
cold water. Add one small onion, sliced, one teaspoonful of 
salt, and a little pepper. Simmer two or three hours, or 
until the bones are clean. Strain, and remove the fat. 
Put the liquor on to boil again, and add for every quart of 
liquor, one cup oi cold meat, cut into small pieces, and half 
a cup of the stuffing. Or omit the stuffing and thicken the 
soup with flour. Simmer till the meat is tender, and 
serve at once. If there be a much larger proportion of 
meat and stuffing left, use it in making scalloped turkey 
or croquettes. This is much better than to boil meat, 
bones, and stuffing together. In that case the stuffing 
absorbs the oil, and gives a very strong, disagreeable 
flavor to the soup. 



White Stock 143 



White Soup Stock. 

White soup stock is made from veal or chicken, sea- 
soned with onion, celery' salt, and white pepper, avoiding 
an3'thing which will give it color. White soups are thick- 
ened with rice, cornstarch, flour, eggs, or the white meat 
of chicken chopped fine, and are made still richer by milk 
or cream. 



White Soup (from Veal). 



4 pounds knuckle of veal. 
3 quarts cold water. 

1 even tablespoonful salt. 
6 peppercorns. 

2 small onions. 
2 stalks celery. 



1 pint milk. 

1 tablesijoonf ul butter. 

1 heaping tablespoonful flour. 

1 teaspoonful salt. . 

1 saltspoonful celery salt. 

}£ saltspoonful white pepper. 



Wipe and cut the veal into small pieces. Put it into 
the kettle with the cold water. Heat slowh' and skim, 
because we do not wish the soup colored. Add the salt, 
peppercorns, onions, and celer3\ Simmer five hours, 
strain, and when cool remove the fat. There should be 
about three pints of stock. When read}^ to use it, put 
the stock on to boil, and the milk into the double boiler. 
Thicken the stock with one tablespoonful of butter and 
one heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch, cooked together. 
Add the boiling milk, the salt, and pepper. Beat two 
eggs until light, put them in the tureen, and strain the 
boiling soup over them. Man}" people prefer to use the 
volks of the eggs onl}-. This makes a 3'ellow soup. 
Others vary it by boiling the eggs hard and rubbing the 
3'olks through a gravj- strainer after the soup is in the 
tureen. 

This veal stock may be clarified with the white of an 
egg, if you wish it transparent. But it is better with the 
milk or cream, and should be highly seasoned, and re- 
duced one half by boiling, as when made from veal alope 
it is insipid. Serve with croutons. 



144 ^^^ Boston Cook Book, 



White Soup (from Chicken). 



3 or 4 pounds fowl. 

3 quarts cold water. 

1 tablespoonful salt. 

6 peppercorns. 

1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 



1 pint cream. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

1 tablespoonful cornstarch. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonful white pepper. 



2 tablespoonfuls chopped celery. 2 eggs. 

Singe, clean, and wipe the fowl. Cut off the legs and 
wings, and disjoint the bod}'. Put it on to boil in cold 
water. Let it come to a boil quickly^ because we wish to 
use the meat as well as the water, and skim thoroughl}-. 
The meat may be removed when tender, and the bones put 
on to boil again. (Use the meat for croquettes or other 
made dishes.) Add the salt and vegetables. Simmer until 
reduced one half. Strain, and when cool remove the fat. 
For one quart of stock allow one pint of cream or milk. 
If cream, use a little less flour for thickening. Boil the 
stock ; add the butter and flour, cooked together, and the 
seasoning. Strain it over the eggs, stirring as 3'ou pour, 
or the eggs will curdle. B3' substituting, for the eggs in 
this white soup, the white meat of the chicken, chopped 
fine and rubbed to a powder, we have Potage a la Reine^ 
which man}^ think too elaborate for any but a professional 
cook to undertake. The breast of a roast chicken ma}- be 
used. Add it to the boiUng stock, then thicken it with 
the flour and butter. Add the cream, and if not perfectl}- 
smooth, strain into the tureen. It should be quite thick 
like cream. Whole rice is sometimes served with clear 
chicken soup. If used as a thickening, boil the rice until 
soft enough to rub through a strainer. Add it to the 
chicken liquor, and unite them with butter and flour cooked 
together. 

The liquor in which a fowl or chicken has been boiled, 
when not wanted for any other purpose, should be saved 
for white soup. If the vegetables and spices are not 
boiled with the fowl, fry them five minutes without burn- 
ing, add them to the stock, and simmer fifteen minutes. 



White Soups. 145 



Sti-ain before serving. Chicken stock clarified makes a 
pale straw-colored, transparent soup. 

Potage a la Reine, No. 2. {Queen Victoria's favorite Soup,) 

Remove the f\it from o?ie quart of the water in which a 
chiclcen has been boiled. Season highly with salt^ pepper^ 
and celery salt, and a little o7iion if desired, and put on to 
boil. Mash the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs fine, and 
mix them with half a cup of bread or cracher crumbs, 
soaked until soft in a little milk. Chop the white meat of 
the chicken until fine like meal, and stir it into the Qgg 
and bread paste. Add one pint of hot cream slowl}', and 
then rub all into the hot chicken liquor. Boil five minutes ; 
add more salt if needed, and if too thick add more cream, 
or if not thick enough add more fine cracker dust. It 
should be li]^e a puree. 

Cocoanut Soup. 

Cook two pounds of veal bones in two quarts of cold 
water until the meat is tender and the stock reduced to 
one quart. Grate the cocoanut and let it simmer with 
the veal the last half hour. Strain out the bones and 
cocoanut, and add to it the milk of the cocoanut and one 
pint of cream. Put it on the fire again, and when boiling, 
thicken it with one tablespoon each of cornstarch and 
butter which must first be blended or cooked as for 
white sauce. Add salt and pepper, and just before 
serving add a little of the broth to two slightly beaten 
eggs, then stir it quickly into the broth and serve at 
once with dried dice of bread.

SOUPS WITHOUT STOCK. 

Any of the soups or purees in this division nia}' be at- 
tempted before one has mastered the imaginary diflicultiet 
of stock-making. The}' are palatable, nutritious, inex 
pensive, and quickly prepared. 



Potato Soup. 



3 potatoes. 

1 pint milk. 

1 teaspoonful chopped onion. 

1 stalk celery. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 



3^ teaspoonful celery salt. 
}£ saltspoonf ul white pepper. 
1^ saltspoonf ul cayenne. 
;o tablespoonf ul flour. 
1 tablespoonf ul butter. 



Wash and pare the potatoes, and let them soak in cold 
water half an hour. Put them into boiling water, and 
cook until ver}^ soft. Cook the onion and celery with the 
milk in a double boiler. AYhen the potatoes are soft, drain 
off the water and mash them. Add the boiling milk and 
seasoning. Rub through a strainer, and put it on to boil 
again. Put the butter in a small saucepan, and when 
melted and bubbling, add the flour, and when well mixed 
stir into the boiling soup ; let it boil five minutes, and sen^e 
ver}^ hot. This flour tliickening keeps the potato and 
milk from separating, and gives a smoothness and con- 
sistency quite nnlike the granular effect which is often 
noticed. If the soup be too thick, add more hot milk. 

The celery salt may be omitted if you have the fresh 
celer}', or, if you like, put owe tahlespoonfid of fine chopped 
'parsley into the soup just before serving. 

When you wish a richer soup, use a quart of milk, mak- 
ing it much thinner, and add tico eggs, well beaten, after 
you take it from the fire ; or put them in the tureen, 
and stir rapidly as you pour in the l)oiling soup. New raw 
potatoes, cut into small dice or balls and cooked till tender 
but not broken, are sometimes served in potato soup. 



Soup without Stock. 147 



Celery Soup. 



1 head celery. 

1 pint water. 

1 pint milk. 

1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 



1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 
J2 teaspoonful salt. 
}.2 saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Wash and scrape the celery, cat into half-inch pieces, 
put it into one pint of boiling salted water, and cook nntil 
very soft. Mash in the water in which it was boiled. Cook 
the onion with the milk, in a double boiler, ten minutes, 
and add it to the celer}'. Rub all through a strainer, and 
put it on to boil again. Cook the butter and flour together 
in a small saucepan until smooth, but not brown, and 
stir it into the boiling soup. Add the salt and pepper ; 
boil five minutes, and strain into the tureen. Serve very 
hot. 

Tomato Soup. 



1 quart can tomatoes. 

1 pint hot water. 

1 tablespoonful sugar. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

4 cloves. 

4 peppercorns, or 



1 saltspoonful white pepper. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 
1 tablesj)Oonf ul cliopped parsley. 
1 tablespoonful cornstarch. 



Put the tomatoes, water, sugar, salt, cloves, and pep- 
j)ercorns on to boil in a porcelain stewpan. Put the but- 
ter in a small saucepan, and when it bubbles put in the 
onion and parsley. Fry five minutes, being careful not to 
burn it. Add the cornstarch, and when well mixed stir 
it into the tomato. Let it simmer ten minutes. Add 
more salt and pepper if needed. Strain, and serve with 
plain boiled rice, or croutons, or toasted crackers.

of the butter and the cornstarch together in a small sauce- 
pan, adding enough of the hot milk to make it pour easily. 
Stir it carefully into the boiling milk, and boil ten minutes. 
Add the remainder of the butter in small pieces, and stir 
till well mixed. Add salt and pepper and the strained 
tomatoes. If the tomatoes be very acid, add half a salt- 
spoonfid of soda before straining. Serve very hot. Many 
would use more tomatoes, but it is more delicate with a 
small quantit}'. 

Black Bean Soup. 



1 pint black beans. 

2 quarts cold water. 

1 small onion. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

1 saltspoonful pepper. 
^ saltspoonful cayenne. 



1 saltspoonful mustard. 

1 tablespoonful flour. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

1 lemon. 

2 hard-boiled eggs. 



Soak the beans over night. In the morning pour ofl 
the water, and put them on to boil in two quarts of cold 
water. Slice the onion and fry it in one tablespoonful of 
the butter. Put it with the beans. Add a bit of celery 
root, if you have it. Simmer four or five hours, or until 
the beans are soft. Add more cold water as it boils away, 
— about half a cup every half-hour, — to check the boil- 
ing and soften the beans, leaving about two quarts when 
done. Rub the beans through a strainer, put the soup 
on to boil again, and add the salt, pepper, and mustard. 
When boiling, thicken it with the flour and butter which 
have been cooked together. This will prevent the beans 
from settling. Season to taste. Cut the lemon and eggs 
into thin slices, put them into the tureen, and pour the hot 
soup over them. Serve with croutons. 

Many think tomatoes are an improvement. If that 
flavor be desired, add to the above half a can of tomatoes, 
before straining. Others think it is not just right unless 
a quarter of a pound of salt pork, or some bones and odds 
and ends of meat, have been boiled with it. The beans 
are sometimes boiled to quite a thick pulp, and after sifting 
made of the proper consistency b}- thinning with brown 



Pea ^^oiip. 14a 



soup stock, and seasoned more highly with the addition 
of ground herbs, spices, force-meat balls, and wine. It 
is then not unlike Mock Turtle Soup. 

A very good bean soup may be made from the remains 
of baked beans. Add one quart of water and a slice of 
onion to each pint of beans. Boil to a pulp, mash, and 
season. Or make the soup of equal parts of white beans 
and canned or dried sweet corn. If dried corn, soak it 
over night, chop it fine, and boil it with the beans. If 
canned corn, chop it, and add it to the beans after 
straining. But whichever way it is prepared, do not boil 
the beans in the water in which the}' were soaked, nor 
serve them without straining, to remove the hulls, which 
contain no nutriment and are indiorestible. 



Split Pea Soup. 



1 cup dried split peas. 
3 pints cold water. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 



^2 teaspoonful sugar. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonful wliite pepper. 



Pick over and wash the peas. Soak over night, or for 
several hours in cold water. Put them on to boil in three 
pints of fresh cold water, and let them simmer until dis- 
solved, adding enough more water, as it boils awaj^, to 
keep three pints of liquid in the kettle. Keep it well 
scraped from the sides of the kettle. When soft, rub through 
a strainer and put on to boil again. Add either water, 
stock, milk, or cream to make the consistency you wish. 
It should be more like a puree than a soup. Cook one 
large tablespoonful of butter and one of flour together, 
and add to the strained soup when boiling. Add the salt 
and pepper, and when it has simmered ten minutes, serve 
at once with fried dice of bread. 

This is delicious made in this simple way. It must 
alwa3's be strained, and thickened with the flour and but- 
ter, or it will separate as it cools. It will be smooth, per- 
fectly free from grease ; and those who like the natural 



I50 The Boston Cook Book. 

taste of the peas prefer it to any other wa}- of cooking. 
Do not think you must boil more or less salt pork with it, 
as most receipts advise. It may be varied in many ways, 
by adding half a can of tomatoes before straining, or 
by boiling with the peas a small onion which has first been 
cut fine and fried in a little butter, or by adding any rem- 
nants of bone or meat, being careful to remove them before 
straining. Always use the split peas, as the hulls have 
been removed, and they cook much more quickly than the 
whole peas. 



Green Pea Soup. 



1 quart green peas. 
1 quart water. 
1 pint milk. 
y^ teaspoonful salt. 



3^ saltspoonful pepper. 
% teaspoonful sugar. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 



Put the peas into one pint of boiling water, and cook 
until soft. Mash them in the water in which they were 
boiled, and rub through a strainer, gradually adding a pint 
of hot water, which will help to separate the pulp from the 
skins. Put on to boil again. Cook the butter and flour 
in a small saucepan, being careful not to brown it. Stir 
it into the boiling soup. Add the salt, sugar, pepper, and 
the milk, which should be hot, using enough milk to make 
it the consistenc}' you prefer. This is a very good wa}' to 
use peas that are old and hard, and unfit to serve as a 
vegetable, which is often the case with those that come 
from a market. When the pods are fresh, wash them 
thoroughl}^ ; allow more water, and boil them with the 
peas. 

Green Corn Soup. 

H saltspoonful white pepper. 
1 teaspoonful sugar. 



1 teaspoonful flour. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 



6 ears sweet corn, or enough to 

make 1 pint raw pulp. 
Water to cover the ears. 
1 pint milk, or cream. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

With a very shar}) knife scrape the thinnest possible 
shaving from each row of kernels, and then, with the back 



Vegetable Soup. 151 



of the kuife, scrape out the pulp, leaving the hull on the 
cob. Break the cobs if long, and put them on to boil in 
enough cold water to cover them. Boil thirt}' minutes and 
strain. There should be about one pint of water after 
straining. Put the corn water on to boil again, and when 
boiling add the corn pulp. Cook fifteen minutes. Add 
the salt, pepper, sugar, and the boiling milk. Thicken 
it with one teaspoon ful of flour and one tablespoonful of 
butter cooked 'together. Boil five minutes and serve at 



once. 



Corn is better for soup when it is a little old for the 
table, and the pulp is thick rather than milky. 



Vegetable Soup (Winter). 



1 cup each of onion and carrot. 
1 cup each of turnip and parsnip. 
1 pint each of celery and potato= 
3^ cup butter or drippings. 
1 teaspoonfui salt. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 



1 teaspoonfui sugar. 
1 saltspoonf ul white pepper. 
)^ saltspoonf ul cayenne pepper. 
1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 
1 slice of bread crust toasted very 
brown. 



Cut the onion, carrot, turnip, parsnip, and celery into 
half-inch dice, reserving the onions to fry, and the pota- 
toes to boil by themselves. Put the butter in a stew- 
pan or soup kettle, and when hot add the onions. After 
frying them carefuU}' until colored but not burned, add the 
flour, and when well mixed pour on gradually a pint of 
hot water. Add the salt, pepper, sugar, bread, vegetables 
(except the potatoes), and enough boiling water to cover 
all. Let them simmer two hours. Boil the potatoes ten 
minutes, drain, and add them to the soup. When the 
vegetables are soft, rub all through a strainer. Add more 
salt and pepper if desired, and keep over hot water until 
read}^ to serve. 

A summer vegetable soup may be made in a similar man- 
ner, using j^oung onions, turnips, carrots, and cauliflower. 
Cut fine and parboil ; then cover with fresh boiling water, 
simmer until soft, mash, strain, season, make quite thin

tity or tender green peas and asparagus tips, previously 
boiled. 



Fish Soup. 



1 pound any boiled fish, — salmon, 

cod, or halibut. 
1 quart milk. 
1 slice onion. 



1 tablespoonful butter. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 
1 teaspoonful sah. 

1 saltspoonful pepper. 



Cook the fish in boiling salted water, until it flakes 
easil}'. Drain it, remove the skin and bones, and rub 
through a coarse strainer. Cook the onion with one 
quart of milk ten minutes, remove the onion, and thicken 
the milk with the flour and butter cooked together. Add 
the seasoning and fish. Let it boil up once and serve. 

Puree of Canned Sahnon. 

Remove the oil, bones, and skin from half a can of 
salmon. Chop the salmon verj' fine. Boil one quart of 
milk^ and season and thicken it as for fish soup. Add the 
salmon, and when heated it is ready to serve. 

Lobster Soup, or Bisque of Lobster. 



2 pounds lobster. 
1 quart milk. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

2 tablesp. flour or cornstarch. 



1 teaspoonful salt. 
1 saltspoonful white pepper. 
I4 saltspoonful cayenne pepper. 
1 pint water. 



Remove the meat of the lobster from the shell, and cut 
the tender pieces into quarter-inch dice. Put the ends of 
the claw meat and an}' other tough, hard parts, with the 
bones of the bod}^, into one pint of cold water, and boil 
twcnt}^ minutes, adding more water as it boils awaj'. Put 
the coral on a piece of paper, and dry it in the oven. 
Boil one quart of milk, and thicken it with one tablespoon- 
ful of butter and two of flour or cornstarch. Boil ten 
minutes. Strain the water from the bones and add it to 
the milk. Add the salt and pepper, using more if high 



I 



Fish Soups. 153 



seasoning be desired. Rub the dried coral through a 
strainer, using enough to give the soup a bright pink color. 
Put the green fat and lobster dice into the tureen, and 
strain the boiUng soup over them. Serve immediatel}'. 

If you do not like so much of the lobster in the soup, 
chop it all ver}' fine, boil it with the milk, and rub it 
through a squash or grav}' strainer. Many like the addi- 
tional thickening of half a cup oX fine cracker crumbs. 

This soup maj' also be varied by using one pint of stocky 
either chicken or veal, and one pint of milk; or by the 
addition oi force-meat halls made in the following manner : 
Cut onl}' half of the meat into dice ; chop the remainder, 
and pound it to a fine paste with the yolks of tivo hard-boiled 
eggs., one teaspoonfd of butter^ a little salt, and pepper ; beat 
one raw egg, and add enough of it to moisten the paste so 
that it ma}' easily be made into balls the size of a nutmeg ; 
let them simmer in the soup about five minutes, just 
enough to cook the egg. 

Lobster Soup, No. 2. 

The meat of tivo smcdl lobsters, cut fine, one pint of cream, 
one pint of 7?iilk. Simmer twenty minutes. Add 07ie table- 
spoonfid of flour wet in cold milk. Salt and cayenne pepper 
to taste. Just before serving add half a cup of butter, cut 
into small pieces, and stir till it is entirely absorbed. 
Strain, and serve verj' hot. 



1 quart oysters. 

1 pint milk. 

1 tablespoonful butter, 



Oyster Soup. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 

Salt to taste. 

% saltspoonful pepper. 



Put the milk on to boil in the double boiler, while you 
prepare the 03'sters. Place a colander over a pan. Put 
the oysters in a large bowl, and pour over them one cup of 
water. Take up each 03'ster with the fingers, to make sure 
no pieces of shell adhere to it, and drain in the colander. 
Strain the oyster liquor, which has drained from the 



154 '^he Boston Cook Book. 

colander, through the finest strainer. Put it on to boil. 
Remove the scum, and Avhen clear put in the oysters. 
Let them simmer, but not boil, until they begin to grow 
plump and the edges to curl or separate. Strain the liquor 
into the milk, and put the oysters where they will keep 
hot, but not cook. Thicken the milk with the butter and 
flour, which have been cooked together ; add salt and 
pepper to taste (the amount of salt depending upon the 
saltness of the oysters) . Boil five minutes ; add the oys- 
ters and serve at once. This receipt may be varied b}' 
boiling one cup of fine chopped celery and a small slice of 
onion with the milk ten minutes ; then straining and thick- 
ening it with half a cup of powdered cracker. Add the 
butter, the seasoning, and the parboiled 03'sters. Serve 
at once. 

Oyster Stew is made like oyster soup, without the 
thickening. 

Clam Soup. 



1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 

1 heaping tablespoonful butter. 

2 heaping tablcspoonf uls flour. 
1 pint milk or cream. 



% peck clams in the shell. 

Salt to taste. 

1 saltspoonful pepper. 

1^ saltspoonful cayenne pepper. 

1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 

Prepare the clams by boiling in the shells, and cutting 
as directed for clam chowder, keeping the soft part sepa- 
rate from the hard. Pour off one quart of the clam liquor 
after it settles, being careful not to take any of the sedi- 
ment ; put it on to boil, and remove the scum. Add one 
pint of hot water ^ and season to taste with salt, pepper, cay- 
enne, onion, and parsley. Put in the hard part of the 
clams. Simmer fifteen minutes, strain, and boil again, 
and when boiling thicken with the flour cooked in the 
butter. Add the hot milk or cream, and the soft part of 
the clams ; serve at once, with crackers and pickles. 

Another method of preparing clam soup, if needed 
quickly : Heat the clam broth to a boiling point ; add the 
clams cut fine ; season, and pour into the tureen over two 
eggs beaten up with the boiling milk. 



Fish Chowder. 155 



The clam broth served hot with toasted crackers will ofteL 
tempt a person with a capricious appetite. 



Fish Chowder. 



i or 5 pounds cod or haddock or 

bass. 
6 potatoes. 

A 2-inch cube of fat salt pork. 
2 small onions. 



1 tablespoonful salt. 

3^2 teaspoonful white pepper. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

1 quart milk. 

6 butter crackers. 



When bu3ing a fish for a chowder, have the head left on 
but the skin removed ; or if 30U have to depend upon 3'our 
self, remove the skin according to directions on page 161. 
Then begin at the tail and cut the fish from the bone on 
one side, keeping the knife as close as possible to the 
bone ; remove the bone from the other side. Do not for- 
get to take out the small bones near the head. Wipe the 
fish carefully with a damp cloth, cut it into pieces about 
two inches square, and put it away in a cool place. Break 
the bones and head, cover with cold water, and put them 
on to boil. Pare and slice the potatoes one eighth of an 
inch thick, using enough to make the same quantit}^ b}' 
measurement as you have of fish. Soak them in cold water 
half an hour, and parboil or scald in boiling water five 
minutes ; then pour ofl" the water. Cut the pork into 
quarter-inch dice, and fry it in an omelet pan. Cut the 
onions into thin slices and fry them in the pork fat, being 
careful that it does not burn. Pour the fat through a 
strainer into the kettle, leading the pork scraps and onions 
in the strainer. Put the sliced potatoes into the kettle ; 
hold the strainer over the potatoes, and pour through it 
enough boiling water to cover them. This is easier than 
to fry in the kettle, and skim out the pork and onions, — 
which to a novice would be running the risk of burning the 
fat, cleaning the kettle, and beginning again. When the 
potatoes have boiled ten minutes, strain the water in which 
the bones were boiled, and pour it into the kettle. Add 
the salt and pepper, and when the chowder is boiling 
briskly, put in the fish, and set it back where it can sim- 



156 The Boston Cook Book. 

mer ten minutes. Do not break the fish by stirring it. 
Add the butter and the hot milk. Split the crackers, put 
them in the tureen, and pour the chowder over them. Do 
not soak the crackers in cold water. Butter crackers will 
soften easil}' in the hot chowder. If you wish the broth 
thicker, stir in one cup of fine cracker crumbs, or one 
tablespoonful of flour cooked in one tablespoonful of butter. 
More milk and a little more seasoning ma}- be added to 
this amount of fish and potato, if you wish to make a larger 
quantit}'. When wanted richer, beat two eggs^ mix them 
with the hot milk, and put in the tureen before turning in 
the chowder. If added while the chowder is in the hot 
kettle, the eggs will curdle. Any firm white fish may be 
used for a chowder, but cod and haddock are best. Many 
use a cod's head with the haddock. The head is rich and 
gelatinous, and it should always be boiled with the bones, 
and the liquor added to the chowder. In this chowder you 
have nothing but what the most dainty person may relish. 
There are no bones, skin, or scraps of boiled pork. Fish, 
potatoes, and crackers are all distinct in the creamy liquid, 
instead of being a past}^ mush, such as is often served. 
For a change, the crackers ma}' be buttered and browned. 

If a highl}' seasoned dish be desired, boil an onion, cut 
into thin slices, with the potatoes ; add more pepper, and 
either caj-enne pepper, Worcestershire sauce, or curry 
powder. Omit the boiling water, and use onl}- that in 
which the bones were boiled, when making a smaller 
quantity. 

Clam Chowder. 



y^ teaspoonful wliite pepper. 
1 large tablespoonful buttei'. 
1 quart milk. 
C butter crackers. 



3o peck clams in the shells. 
1 quart potatoes, sliced thin. 
A 2-inch cube of fat salt pork. 
1 or 2 onions. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

Clam chowder is made in the same manner as fish 
chowder, substituting half a peck of clams for the fish. 
Clams in the shells are better, as 3-ou then have more 
clam liquor. Wash with a small brush, and put them

157 



in a large kettle with half a cupful of water, or just enough 
to keep the under ones from burning ; set them over the 
fire. "When the clams at the top have opened, take them 
out with a skimmer, and when cool enough to handle, take 
the clams from the shell ; remove the thin skin ; then with 
scissors cut off all the black end, cut the ^' leather straps" 
into small pieces, leaving the soft part whole. Let the 
clam liquor settle, and pour it ofi" carefully. Use half 
water and half clam liquor. Fr}' the pork and onion the 
same as in fish chowder ; add the potatoes, which have been 
soaked and scalded, and boihng water to cover. When 
the potatoes are soft, add the clam liquor, the seasoning, 
and the clams ; when warmed through, add the hot milk 
and turn into the tureen. Do not put the clams into the 
chowder until the potatoes are nearl}' done, as prolonged 
boilins: hardens them. 



Corn Chow^der. 



1 quart raw sweet corn. 

1 pint sliced potatoes. 

A 2-inch cube fat salt pork. 

1 onion. 

1 teaspoonf ul salt. 



1 saltspoonful white pepper. 
1 large tablespoouful butter. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 
1 pint sliced tomatoes. 
1 pint milk. 



Scrape the raw corn from the cob. Boil the cobs twenty 
minutes in water enough to cover them ; then skim them 
out. Pare, soak, and scald the potatoes. Fr}' the onion 
in the salt pork fat, and strain the fat into the kettle with 
the corn water. Add the potatoes, corn, salt, and pepper. 
Simmer fifteen minutes, or till the potatoes and corn are 
tender. Add the butter and milk, and serve very hot 
with crisped crackers. 



1 pound lobster. 
1 quart milk. 
3 crackers. 
3^ cup butter. 



Lobster Chowder. 



1 scant teaspoonful salt. 

1-2 saltspoonful white pepper. 

34 saltspoonful cayenne pepper. 



Boil one quart of milk. Roll three crackers fine ; mix 
with them one fourth of a cup of butter, and the green fat 



158 The Boston Cook Book. 

of the lobster. Season with one scant teaspoonful of 
salt, half a saltspoonful of white pepper, and one fourth 
of a saltspoonful of caj'enne pepper. Pour the boiling 
milk gradually over the paste. Put it back in the double 
boiler ; add the lobster meat cut into dice ; let it boil up 
once, and serve. 

Puree of Clams. 

One pint of boiled clams ; remove the dark substance 
from the soft part, and chop the hard part ver}' fine. 
Thicken one pint of hot cream with one tablespoonful of flour 
cooked in one heaping tablespoonful of hot butter ; add the 
chopped clams, the soft parts, and salt and pepper. Add 
more hot cream or a little of the clam liquor if the puree 
be too thick. When hot, strain it into the tureen. 



3 onions. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 
1 cup claret, or 



Courbouillon. 

M cup vinegar. 

1 pint beef stock. 

2 pounds fish, sliced. 
4 tomatoes. 



Fry the sliced onions in the butter in the bottom of the 
stewpan ; be careful not to burn them ; add the flour, 
mix well; add gradually the stock, and, when smooth, 
put in half the fish, then half the tomatoes peeled and 
sliced, and the wine or vinegar; then another layer of 
fish and tomatoes. Simmer half an hour. The fish 
should be skinned and boned. 

Cherry Soup. 

Soups made from fruit juices only slightly sweetened, 
thickened with arrowroot and served cold in bouillon cups 
are quite acceptable in hot days. Allow one pint of water 
to a pint of fruit. Stew, mash, and sift the fruit, sweeten 
and thicken slightly, then l)oil till clear. Some fiuits re- 
quire a little lemon juice or wine. Add chipped ice and 
serve with zwieback or toasted wafers. 



Fish. 159 



FISH. 

Fish, on account of its abundance, cheapness, and 
wliolesomeness, is invaluable as an article of food. It is 
less nutritious and less stimulating than meat, as it con- 
tains less solid matter and more water. An exaggerated 
idea of the value of fish as brain food has prevailed ; the 
latest authorities, however, state that there is no evidence 
to prove that fish is an}' richer than meat in phosphorus. 
But as it contains little fat, the white varieties particularh*, 
it is easily digested, and as it has a large proportion of 
nitrogenous material, it is especially adapted to all those 
upon whom there are great demands for nervous energy. 

Salmon heads the list •' of whatsoever hath scales and 
fins," in nutritive qualities ; and it is richer than meat. 
The next in value are fat halibut, shad, white-fish, mack- 
erel, blue-fish, lean halibut, bass, flounder, trout, cod, 
haddock, cusk, etc. 

Red-blooded fish, like salmon, mackerel, and blue-fish, 
have the oil distributed through the body. They are 
nutritious for those who can digest them, but are too rich 
and oil}' for invalids. White fish, hke flounder, halibut, 
cod, and haddock, have the oil in the liver, and are more 
easil}' digested. Fish should be perfectly fresh and thor- 
oughly cooked, or it will be very indigestible and some- 
times poisonous. Broiling and baking are the best methods. 
Small pan-fish and fillets of large white dr}' fish are good 
if fried ; but oily fish should never be fried. Salting draws 
out the nutritive part of fish the same as it does in meat ; 
and either, when thus prepared, should be used as a relish, 
and not depended upon for nourishment. Fat fish are 
injured less than white fish, as the fat is not removed by 
salting. 



l6o The Boston Cook Booh. 



All varieties of fish need an accompaniment of starch}' 
foods, like bread and potatoes ; and white fish need beside 
to be cooked with butter or fat to make them desirable as 
food. The juices offish, shell-fish particular!}-, are of an 
alkaline nature ; and this renders lemon juice or vinegar 
a desirable condiment as a neutralizing agency. 

The flesh of good, fresh fish is firm and hard, and will 
rise at once when pressed with the finger. If the eyes be 
dull and sunken, the gills pale, and the flesh flabby or 
soft, the fish is not fresh. 

Fish should be cleaned as soon as possible, in strongly 
salted water. They should be washed (not soaked) b}' 
wiping with a cloth wet in salt water. Then wrap them 
ir* a cloth which is sprinkled with salt, and put them in 
a cool place. If put in the ice-chest, they will taint the 
butter and milk. Put ice around them, if necessary ; but 
do not let them touch the ice, as fresh water and ice will 
soften them. AVlien once the}' lose their hard, firm con- 
sistency, they are considered unfit to eat by those who 
know what good fish really are. 

Frozen fish should be thawed in cold water. Fresh- 
water fish having a muddy taste or smell are improved by 
soakuig in salt and water. Salt fish should be soaked in 
fresh water, with the skin side ujj, to draw out the salt, 
and should be eaten only occasionally, for the reason 
before stated. 

To Clean a Fish. — If the fish have scales, remove them 
before opening. Scrape with a small, sharp knife from 
the tail to the head ; hold the knife flat and slanting, 
resting it on the fish, that the scales may be taken 
upon the knife ; scrape slowly, that the scales may not 
fly over everything near, and rinse the knife often in cold 
water. 

When the fish is to be served whole, lU) not ivmove the 
head and tail Smelts and small fish served whole are 
opened under the gills, and the contents squeezed out by 
pressing from the middle with the thumb and finger. Large 
fish are split open from the gills half-way down the lower 



Fish. i6i 

part of the bod}', the entrails removed, and the inside 
scraped and cleaned. Open far enough to remove all the 
blood on the backbone. Man}- leave the sound, which is 
the white part adhering to the bone ; but it is better to 
remove it. 

To Skin a Fish. — Cut a thin, narrow strip down the 
backbone, taking off the dorsal fin. Then open the lower 
part half-wa}- down. Slip the knife under and up thi'ough 
the bou}- part of the gills, and hold this bonj' part between 
the thumb and finger, and strip the skin off toward the 
tail. Then do the same on the other side. 

Small fish, like mackerel and white-fish, when dressed 
for broiling, should be split through the back. 

To Bone a Fish. — Clean, and strip off the skin ; lay the 
fish flat on a board ; begin at the tail, and run the knife in 
under the flesh close to the bone, and scrape it away clean 
from the bone, holding the flesh carefulh^, not to break 
the flakes. When the flesh on one side is removed, slip 
the knife under the bone on the other side, and raise the 
bone, leaving the flesh on the board ; then pull out all the 
small bones left in the flesh, which 3-ou can easily feel with 
the fingers. Fish with many fine bones, like shad and her- 
ring, are not boned ; but from cod, cusk, mackerel, white- 
fish, and haddock the}- may be easil}- removed. 

Fillets of Fish are the flesh separated from the bone, and 
ser^^ed whole or divided, as the case ma}- require. Floun- 
ders or sole, chicken halibut, and bass, should have the 
fillets on each side divided lengthwise ; making four long 
thin pieces, or fillets. Other fish are cut into thin slices 
or small squares. Very small fish may be split, the bone 
removed, and the whole fish rolled up from the tail to the 
head and fastened with a skewer. 

Broiled Fish. 

First clean the fish. Wash with a cloth wet in salt water, 
and dry on a clean fish towel, kept for no other purpose. 
Mackerel, white-fish, small blue-fish, trout, small cod, and

shad should be split down the back, and if you prefer, cut 
off the head and tail. Halibut and salmon should be cut 
into inch slices, the skin and bone removed, and turned 
often while broiling. Cut flounder, bass, and chicken hal- 
ibut into fillets. Oil}' fish need onh' salt and -pepper ; but 
dvy white-fish should be spread with soft butter or olive oil 
before broiling. 

Use a double wire broiler, and grease well with salt porl 
rind. Put the thickest edge of the fish next the middle of 
the broiler, and always broil the flesh side first, as the skin 
burns easily. Cook the flesh side until it is brown. The 
time should vary with the thickness of the fish ; move the 
broiler up and down, that all parts may be equally browned ; 
then turn, and cook on the other side just enough to crisp 
the skin. Small fish require from five to ten minutes ; 
thicker fish, fifteen or twenty minutes. The fire should be 
hot and clear. If the fish be very thick, hold it farther 
from the fire ; or when nicel}' browned, put the broiler in 
the oven on a dripping-pan, and cook till the flesh sepa- 
rates easil}' from the bones. Mackerel, trout, and fresh 
herring are sometimes broiled whole. Clean without open- 
ing more than is necessar}'. Wipe and dr}' well. Gash 
through to the bone at intervals one inch apart on each side, 
and rub salt^ pepper^ and butter or oil in the incisions ; wrap 
in buttered paper, and broil carefully from ten to twentj- 
minutes. When ready to serve, loosen the fish from the 
broiler on each side, open the broiler, and, leaving the flesh 
side of the fish uppermost, slide it oflT without breaking. Or 
open the opposite way, hold a platter over the skin side, 
and invert platter and broiler together. Spread with butter^ 
salt, and pepper ; or add chopped parsley or icatercresses ; 
or serve with Maitre d'hotel, Tartare, Tomato, or Curry 
sauce. Garnish vfiih. parsley and slices of lemon. 

Baked Fish. 

Cod, haddock, cusk, blue-fish, small salmon, bass, and 
shad mav be stuff"ed, and baked whole. 



Baked Fish. 163 



Stuffing for Baked Fish weighing from four to six Pounds. 



1 teaspoonful chopped parsley. 
1 teaspoonful capers. 
1 teasi^oonf ul pickles. 



1 cup cracker crumbs. 

1 saltspoouful salt. 

7 saltspoouful pepper. 

1 teaspoonful chopped onion. 

This makes a diy, crumblj' stuffiug. If a moist stuffing 
be desired, use stale (not dried) bread crumbs, and moisten 
witli one beaten egg and the butter ; or moisten the crackers 
with warm water. 

Oyster Stuffing. — One pint of oysters, one cup of seasoned 
and buttered cracker crumbs. Drain and roll each 03'ster in 
the crumbs. Fill the fish with the oysters, and sprinkle 
the remainder of the crumbs over the oysters. 

General Directions. — Fish bake through more evenly, 
brown better, and are more easily served, if placed upright 
in the pan instead of on one side. Fish that are broad 
and short, like shad, may be kept in place b}' propping 
with stale bread or pared potatoes. But all others that are 
narrow in proportion to the length ma}' be skewered or 
tied into the shape of a letter S ; run a threaded trussing- 
needle through the head, middle of the bodj' and tail in 
the direction indicated b}' the dotted line above ; then 
draw the string tight, and fasten the ends. Fish thus 
prepared will keep their shape after baking. 

Have an iron sheet with rings at the ends for handles, 
and just large enough to fit into the dripping-pan. Eub 
the sheet well with salt pork, and put pieces of pork under 
the fish to keep it from sticking. This sheet will enable 
you to lift the fish from the pan and place it on the platter 
without breaking. If you have no sheet, put two broad 
strips of cotton cloth across the pan, before laying in the 
fish. When done, lift out on the cloth. Do not put water 
in the pan, unless you wish to steam instead of bake the 
fish. Put two or three slices cf fat salt pork over and 
near the fish, and when the floui has browned, baste 
often with the pork fat. Bake till brown, and baste 
often.

carefully from the fish sheet, and place it on a hot platter. 
Draw out the strings or skewer, w'ipe off all the water or 
fat which runs from the fish, and remove the pieces of 
pork. Pour Hollandaise sauce around (not over) the 
fish, or serve a drawn butter sauce flavored with lemon, 
in a sauce-boat ; and pile Saratoga potatoes lightly around 
the fish. Garnish the head of the fish with parslej^ or 
watercresses. 

To serve the Fish. — Make an incision along the backbone 
the entire length of the fish ; then draw the fish away from 
the bone on each side, cutting at right angles with the 
bone. Raise the bone to reach the stuflfing, and serve a 
little of the fish, stuffing, and sauce to each person. The 
skeleton should be left entire on the platter. 

No. 2. — Remove the head, tail, and skin. Rub well with 
salt and le?no7i juice. Stuff with oi/ster stuffing., and sew 
securely. Skewer it into shape, if long enough, or put 
it upright on a greased fish sheet, witli bread to keep 
it in i)lace. Or remove the bone, place the fish on a 
platter, and la}' the prepared oysters between the layers 
of fish. Season cracker crumbs with salt, pepper, and 
chopped 'parsley , and moisten with melted butter. Brush the

fish with beaten egg, then sprinkle with the crumbs. Set 
the platter in the oven over a pan of hot water to keep the 
platter from cracking. Bake from forty to sixt}^ minutes. 
Serve with tomato or HoUandaise sauce poured around 
the fish. 

JVb. 3. Baked Halibut. — Three or four pounds of halibut. 
Dip the dark skin in boiling ivater, and scrape clean. Rub 
well with salt and pepper. Put it into a clean pan, and 
pour 7nilk over it till half an inch deep. Bake about an 
hour, basting with the milk. Remove the bone and skin, 
and arrange on the platter in the original form. Serve 
with plain drawn butter, egg sauce, or cream sauce, and 
garnish with slices of boiled eggs. The milk keeps the 
fish moist, is a good substitute for pork, and makes the 
fish brown better. Use jnst enough milk to baste, and 
let it cook away toward the last. Or sprinkle buttered 
crumbs over the top, when the fish is nearly done, and 
serve with tomato sauce. 

A large cod, or any whole fish too large for a small 
family, may be cooked as follows : Remove the skin and 
bones from the middle and thickest part ; stuff" and bake. 
Use the bones and head for a chowder. Cut the tail 
piece into shces, salt well, and fty or broil them. Or crimp 
them by soaking in salted water ; then simmer in water 
with salt and lemoti Juice, and serve cold with Tartare 
sauce. 

Fried Fish. 

Mackerel, salmon, blue-fish, and all oily fish should 
never be fried. Smelts, perch, and other small pan-fish 
may be fried whole. When fried smelts are used as a 
garnish, fry them in the shape of rings by pinning the tail 
in the mouth. Cod, halibut, etc., should be skinned and 
boned, and cut into slices one inch thick and two or three 
inches square. Flounder and bass may be cut in fillets, as 
described on page 161, and each fillet seasoned with salt 
and pepper, and fastened with a small wooden skewer. 
Small fish may be boned without parting in the middle. 



1 66 The Boston Cook Booh. 

and rolled from tail to head. Fish for frying should be 
thoroughl}' cleaned and dried, seasoned with salt and 
pepper, and covered first with flour or line bread crumbs, 
then dipped in beaten egg, then in crumbs again. If this 
does not cover them completel}', repeat the process. 

When the fish has been kept on ice, let it become slightly 
warm before frying, as otherwise it will chill the fat and 
become greasy. Fr}- in deep, smoking hot fat. Observe 
the directions given for frying on page 15, testing the fat 
first with bread ; and after the first plunge into the hot fat 
set the kettle back to keep from burning ; then reheat 
before frying an}- more. Fr}' from two to five minutes. 
Drain and serve with tomato, or Tartare, or any acid 
sauce. Garnish with slices of pickle or lemon, and 
parslc}'. 

Arrange small fish with heads and tails alternating ; 

or two or three on a 
skewer, one skewer 
for each person ; or 
in a circle round a 
silver cup, placed in 
the centre of the 
platter and holding the sauce. Slices or rolled fillets may^ 
be arrani^ed in a circle, with the sauce in the centre. 



Boiled Fish. 

Boiling is the most insipid and wasteful way of cooking 
fish. To make boiled fish palatable, a rich sauce, like 
lobster, oyster, or shrimp sauce, is needed for all kinds 
except salmon and blue-fish. Salmon is so much richer 
and more oily than other fish that boiling does not injure 
it. Hollandaise and salice piquante arc appropriate for 
salmon. A fish kettle with a drainer for lifting out the 
fish is quite essential. Or you may put a small i)iece of 
fish in a wire basket or on a plate ; tie the plate in a 
square of cloth, and lift cloth, plate, and fish togetlier. 
Never try to boil a fish whole, as nothing can be more 




Fig. 8. Small Fish served whole. 



Boiled Fish, 167 

unsightly than the head of a boiled fish. Clean the fish 
thoroughly-, and remove the head, tail, and skin. Kub 
well ^rith salt and lemon juice. Fish should be of uniform 
thickness, to boil nicely. A small salmon or the middle cut 
of a large one^ or the thickest part of cod or blue-Jish, or a 
thick piece of halibut^ should be selected for boiling. Cod, 
haddock, and cusk, unless perfectly fresh, will break in 
boiling. 

If fish be put into cold water, the juices are drawn out 
into the water. If cooked in rapidly boiling water, the 
fish breaks on the outside before the middle is done. The 
best and most economical waj- is to cook it in a steamer 
over boiling water. If that is not convenient, put the 
fish into boiling salted water, and simmer till done. Fish 
is cooked when the fiesh separates easily from the bones, 
and should be taken up immediately, and well drained be- 
fore serving. A very good way of boiUng fish is to steep 
it for five minutes in strongly salted boiling water, with one 
or two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, then plunge it into 
fresh boiling water without salt, and simmer till done. 
Less scum rises in the fresh water, and the fish looks 
whiter. Allow about six minutes to a pound for boiling ; 
more if in a cubical form than for a thin narrow piece of 
the same weight. 

Serve boiled fish on a folded napkin, and the sauce in a 
sauce-boat. Parisienne potatoes boiled or fried and piled 
like cannon balls, alternating with parsley and button 
mushrooms ; or sliced pickles, fried 03'sters, Saratoga po- 
tatoes, slices of lemon, or hard-boiled eggs ma\' be used 
as a garnish. If the fish break and look unsightly, re= 
move the bones, and flake it ; pile it lightly on a platter, 
and pour the sauce over the fish. 

To boil Fish cm Court Bouillon. — Fish are improved by 
cooking in water fiavored with ^getables and spices. 
Mince one onion., one stalk of celery, and two or three sprigs 
of parsley. Fr}' tUem in a little butter ; add tivo tablespoon- 
fids of salt, six peppercorns, a bay leaf, three cloves, two 
quarts of boiling water., and one pint of vinegar or sour

wine. Boil fifteen minutes, skim well, strain, and keep 
to use in boiling fish. Rub the fish with salt and lemon 
juice^ and put it into the boiling liquor, and simmer till 
the flesh separates from the bone. 

Stewed Fish. — Any dry white fish or fresh-water fish 
may be stewed, and made into a very palatable and eco- 
nomical dish. Remove the skin, head, and bones from 
a four-pound Jish. Cover the bones and head with cold 
water, and cook them for half an hour. Slice and scald 
two small onions. Drain, and fry them till yellow, in the 
fat obtained from a tico-inch cube of salt pork. Pour it all 
into the kettle with the bones. Cut the fish into pieces 
two inches square, and season them with salt and pepper. 
Put them in a clean kettle with a little butter to keep them 
from sticking, and strain the boiling bone water over 
them, using just enough to cover. Add the juice of halj 
a lemon., and when boiling thicken with one heaping tahle- 
spoonf id of butter Siud two of Jlour cooked together. Sim- 
mer fifteen minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste, and 
07ie tablespoonfid each of chopped parsley^ and tomato or 
mushroom catchup., if desired ; or add one quart of drained 
oysters^ and simmer till the 03'sters are plump. A Matelote 
of fish is the French name for fish stewed with wine. 

Fish a la Creme. 

Four to six pounds of Jish, one to one and a half pints of 
cream sauce .^ and one cup of cracker crumbs, moistened in 
one third of a cup of melted butter. 

This is one of the most attractive and convenient 
methods of serAing any kind of dry white fish, — cod, had- 
dock, or cusk. Clean the fish ; cook in boiling salted 
water with one tablespoonful of vinegar till the flesh sepa- 
rates easily. Drain, and when cool remove the skin and 
bones, and pick apart in flakes. Sprinkle well with scdt 
and pepper. Make a rich white sauce. Put a layer of 
fish on a platter suitable for serving. Cover with the 
white sauce, letting the fish soak up all it will ; then arrange 



Fish Left Overs. 169 



another layer of fish and sauce. Moisten cracker crumbs 
in melted butter, and spread over the top with a fork. 
Set the platter in the oven over a pan of hot water, to 
keep the platter from cracking, and bake till the crumbs 
are brown. Garnish with parsley. The ichites of two or 
three eggs, beaten stiff and salted, are sometimes used in 
the place of crumbs, but are not so palatable. Two or 
th7^ee tahlespoonfuls of grated cheese may be mixed with 
the crumbs, if you like the flavor. 

The sauce may be mixed with the fish ; but be careful 
not to mash the fish or get it too moist. Then the fish 
may be piled on the platter, higher and broader at one 
end and giving the outline of a flat fish ; or arranged in 
the form of a fish shaped like the letter S, and covered 
with the crumbs. Or, if the fish be not broken in boiling, 
take it up carefuU}' on the drainer, remove the head, skin, 
and small bones from one side, put a platter over the fish 
and invert platter and fish together ; then remove the 
skin and the backbone from the other side, leaving the fish 
as whole as possible. Cover with the sauce and crumbs, 
and bake as above. This is not so desirable as the first 
method, because some fine bones are liable to be over- 
looked, and the sauce is not so well mixed with the fish. 

Remnants of Cooked Fish. 

Remnants of cold boiled or baked fish (using stuffing 
and sauce also) ma}' be freed from skin and bones, flaked, 
and used in an}' of the following wa3's : — 

Scalloped Fish. — Vwijish and stuffing into a shallow dish 
in alternate la3'ers, with cream sauce to moisten ; cover 
with buttered crumbs^ and bake till the crumbs are brown. 

Fish in Potato Border. — Warm the Jish slighth' in a 
white sauce, and put it in the centre of a dish with a border 
of mashed potatoes. Or, if 3'ou have enough material for 
a large platter, put the border on the edge and a higher 
mound of potatoes in the centre, and fill the space between 
with the fsh. Sprinkle buttered crumbs lightlj' ovfcr the 
whole and set in the oven till brown. 



170 The Boston Cook Book. 

Chartreuse^ or Casserole of Fish ^ No. 1. — One cup of auj 
cold fish ^ flaked, seasoned, and moistened with a little 
cream ; the same quantity of mashed potatoes ; and two hard- 
hailed eggs. Butter a small mould and put in alternate la}' 
ers of potatoes, fish, and slices of Qg^. Steam twent} 
minutes, turn out upon a hot platter, and garnish with 
'oarsley. 

No. 2. — Mix one cup of stale bread crumbs^ one pint of 
cold fish ^ flaked, and two eggs. Season to taste with War- 
cestershire or tomato catchup y salt ^ and cayenne p)epper. Put 
into a buttered mould. Boil thirty- minutes, and serve 
with an}' fish sauce. 

Kedgeree. — Warm cold flaked fish slightly over hot 
water ; and just before ser^ang stir in one egg., beaten 
with one or two tablespoonfuls of hot milk and a bit of butter ., 
and serve in a rice border. Steam the rice, one cup fid., in 
two cupfids of highly seasoned stock, in a double boiler thirty 
minutes, or till tender and drj-. 

Curried Fish. — Warm an}' cold flaked fish in curry 
sauce., page 190. 

Creamed Fish with Oysters. — Add an equal amount of 
oysters to the^s/^, and cook in wJiite sauce till the oysters 
are plump. Garnish with points of toast. 

Spiced Fish. — Steep six cloves, six allspice kernels., six 
peppercorns., and one tablespoonful of brown sugar in one cup 
of sharp vinegar ten minutes, and pour it over one pint of 
any cold flaked fish. 



Crimped Fish. 

Soak slices of any firm white fresh fish in very strongly 
salted water. Put them into boiling salted water enough 
to cover, with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar., and boil about 
ten minutes. Drain ; arrange on a platter ; remove the 
skin and bones. Serve hot with oyster or lobster sauce, 
or cold with a Jlfayonnaise or Tart are sauce poured 
into the cavity left by the bone. Garnish with water* 
presses. 



Fish Balls. 1 71 



Potted Fish. 

Three shad or six small mackereL uncooked ; one third of a 
cup of salt with half a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper mixed 
with it, and half a cup of whole spices., — cloves^ peppercorns, 
and allspice mixed in about equal proportions. Vine- 
gar to cover. Clean, remove the skin, split in halves, cut 
each half into three pieces, and remove all the larger bones. 
Pack the fish in la3'ers in a small stone jar. (Earthenware 
must not be used on account of the vinegar.) Sprinkle 
the salt and spices over each layer. Add one onion sliced 
thin, if 3'ou do not dislike the flavor. Add vinegar enough 
to completel}' cover the fish. Tie a thick paper over the 
top, or tie a cloth over and cover with a crust of dough to 
keep in all the steam. Bake in a \Qvy moderate oven five 
or six hours. Remove the dough-crust, and when cooled 
cover, and keep in a cool place. 

This will keep some time, if the fish be kept under the 
vinegar ; the bones will be dissolved, and it makes an ex- 
cellent relish for lunch or tea. 

Rules for Fish Salad, Croquettes, and Chowder are given 
elsewhere. 



Salt Fish Balls. 



1 cup raw salt fish. 

1 pint potatoes. 

1 teaspoonf ul butter. 



1 egg, well beaten. 

3^ sahspoonful pepper. 

More sah, if needed. 



Wash the fish, pick in half-inch pieces, and free from 
bones. Pare the potatoes, and cut in quarters. Put the 
potatoes and fish in a stewpan, and cover with boiling 
water. Boil twent3'-five minutes, or till the potatoes are 
soft. Be careful not to let them boil long euough to be- 
come sogg}'. Drain off all the water ; mash and beat the 
fish and potatoes till very light. Add the butter and 
pepper, and when slight!}' cooled add the agg and more 
salt, if needed* Shape in a tablespoon without smoothing 
much, slip them oflT into a basket, and fiy in smoking hoi 



172 The Boston Cook Book, 

lard one minute. Fiy onl}' five at a time, as more will 
cool the fat. The lard should be hot enough to brown a 
piece of bread while you count forty. Or, first dipping 
the spoon in the fat, take up a spoonful of tlie fish and 
plunge it into the hot fat. Drain on soft paper. 

These fish balls should be mixed while the potatoes and 
fish are hot. If you wish to prepare them the night 
before, omit the ^gg^ and in the morning warm the fish 
and potato in a double boiler, then add the egg. Keep the 
fish in a bowl of cold water while picking it apart, and 
it will need no further soaking. 

Contrary to all old theories, boiling the fish with the 
potato does not harden it. When well mashed and beaten 
with a strong fork, the fish will only be recognized in the 
potato b}^ the taste, and not hy the presence of hard, lumpy 
pieces. Never chop salt fish. If picked apart into small 
pieces and then rubbed with a potato masher till it is re- 
duced to fine threads, it will blend with an}' mixture 
better than it will when chopped. These are the most 
quickly prepared and the most delicious fish balls ever 
made, and are worthy the superlative adjectives which 
have been given them b}' enthusiastic pupils. 

Fish Hash. — The same mixture as above, cooked in a 
little salt pork fat in a frying-pan till brown, and turned 
out like an omelet. 

Fish Souffle. — Prepare the fish as for fish balls ; add two 
taUespoonfuls of cream and two eggs, beaten separately- ; and 
bake in a buttered dish. 

To prepare Salt Fish for Cooking. 

Soak over night in cold water with the s/tin side up.^ that 
the salt ma}- be drawn out ; or, if you can, strip the skin 
ofi* before soaking. By changing the water often, less time 
will be required. S(dl mackerel and other small corned fish 
should be broiled. Salt codfsh should be put on the stove 
in fresh water and kept warm, but not boiling, till softened. 
Then remove the bones and skin, and flake in delicate 
pieces. Serve with egg or cream sauce, potatoes, sweet beets, 



Fish Roes, 173 



carrots^ and onions, and crisp salt porh scraps, and you have 
the old-fashioned salt Jish dinner. 

Creamed Salt Fish. — Serve one cup of the picked up 
Jish in a rich cream sauce with potato border or on toast. 

Mock Oyster Stew. {Mrs. S. M.Bailey.) — Prepare one 
cup of salt Jish by washing, shredding, and simmering till 
soft ; when ready to serve, put it in a shallow^ dish with 
07ie pint of oyster crackers or three butter crackers split and 
browned, and pour over it one pint of hot milk. Add a 
tablespoonful of butter and halj a saltspoonful of pepper., and 
serve. 

Scorched Salt Fish. — Pick a small piece of the thickest 
part of salt Jish into long flakes. If verj' salt, soak a few 
minutes in cold water. Brown over hot coals. Spread 
with butter, and serve hot. Fish thus prepared is a nice 
relish with potatoes which have been roasted in the ashes. 
It will also tempt a convalescent. Smoked salmon or hali- 
but may be prepared in the same manner. 

Tongues and Sounds. — Soak them in warm water several 
hours, or till freshened ; scrape off the skm. Cut them in 
small pieces and heat slowly in ?jiilk or ivater. Make a 
thin tvliite sauce to pour over them, and serve on toast 
garnished with hard-boiled eggs. 

Fish Roes, Fried. 

Wash the roes and cook them ten nainutes in boiling 
salted water with one tablespoonful of vinegar. Then 
plunge them into cold water. Drain, and roll in beate?i 
egg, then in seasoned crumbs, and fry till brown in smok- 
ing hot fat. * 

Scalloped Roes. — Boil the roes as in the preceding re- 
ceipt. Drain, and break up lightly with a fork. Sprinkle 
a layer of the roe in a shallow dish ; then rub the yolk of 
hard-boiled egg through a fine strainer. Add a spriukhng 
of parsley and a little lemon juice. IMoisten with a thin 
white sauce. Then another layer of roe, egg, seasoning, 
and sauce. Cover with buttered crumbs and bake tilL

any cold flaked flsli^ or a small quantity of cooked rice. 

Small Fresh Fish Baked in a Crust. 

Clean the fish, and wipe dry. Cut gashes one inch apart 
on each side ; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Make a rich 
biscuit crust with baking-powder, or make a pastry crust ; 
roll it out half an inch thick ; wrap the fish in the crust, 
pinch the edges together, and bake about half an hour. 
Serve with egg sauce.

SHELL FISH. 

Oysters^ CJams, Scallops, Lobsters, Crabs ^ Shrimps^ aiul 
Prawns are the principal varieties of shell fish used as 
food. 

Oysters. 

These shell fish are found in perfection in the cool waters 
of the Northern Atlantic coast. The Blue Points from 
Long Island are considered the best in the New York 
market. The Wareham and Providence River are equally 
esteemed in Boston. Ojsters are neither healthful nor 
well flavored from Ma}^ to September ; at all other times 
the}' are used more extensively and are more highly- prized 
than any other shell fish. Thej^ are nutritious, and are 
easily digested when fresh and eaten raw, or when only 
slightly cooked. When over-cooked, the}' are tough and 
leather}'. Oysters should never be kept long after being 
taken from the shell ; and if to be used raw, should not 
be opened till just before using. 

Oysters cooked in the Shells. — Wash and scrub the shells, 
and put them in a pan with the round side down (to hold 
the juice), and cook either in a hot oven, on the top of a 
hot stove, on a gridiron over the coals, or in a steamer, 
ten to twenty minutes. When the shells open, the oysters 
are done. Remove the upper shell ; season the oyster on 
the lower shell with butter, pepper, salt, and vinegar, and 
serve at once. Or take from the shells, put into a hot 
dish, season, and serve immediately. There is no other 
way of cooking the oyster in which the natural flavor is 
so fully developed. 

Jiaia Oysters. — Open the oysters ; look them over care- 
fully ; remove any fine pieces of shell which may adhere to 
them ; then season slightly with salt and pepper, and let 



176 The Boston Cook Book, 

them stand half an hour in the ice chest. Serve on fancy 
oyster plates, or on the deep half-shell, with slices of lemon. 
Serve with small squares of buttered brown bread. 

Oysters on Ice. — Put a rectangular block of clear ice^ 
having smooth, regular surfaces, in a large pan. With a 
hot brick or flat-iron melt a cavity large enough to hold 
the desired number of oysters. Pour the water from the 
cavit}", and fill with oysters, which should first be drained, 
and seasoned with salt and pepjjer. Place a thick napkin 
on a platter, put the ice upon this, cover the dish with 
parsley or smilax, and garnish with lemon. The ice is some- 
times roughly chipped to resemble a rock. If the dinner 
be served from the sideboard, individual plates of ice are 
made. 

To prepare Oysters for Cooking. — Pour half a cup of cold 
water over one quart of oysters ; then with clean hands 
take out the oysters separately and remove any bits of 
shell or seaweed. Serious accidents have often resulted 
from the presence of pieces of shell. The crabs which 
are found among the oysters are considered a delicacy 
and should be saved. The oyster liquor is seldom used, 
as enough comes from the 03'sters in cooking ; but, if de- 
sired, it should be strained before using. The 03'sters ma}^ 
then be cooked in an}' of the following wa^^s. 

To cook or parboil Oysters in their Liquor. — Put them 
in a saucepan without water ; stir them, or shake the pan 
slightl}' ; as soon as heated, sufficient liquor comes from 
them to keep them from burning. When the edges curl or 
ruffle, and the 03'sters look plump instead of flat, they 
are cooked. Season with salt^ pepper., and butter., and 
serve as a plain roast; or pour on toast., and call it a 
fancy roast. 

For Oyster Steiv, see page 154. 

Smothered Oysters. — Put one tablespooiiful of butter in a 
covered saucepan with half a saltspoonful of white pepper., 
one teaspoonful of salt., and a few grains of cayenne pepper. 
When hot, add one pint of oysters carefulh" prepared. 
Cover closely, and shake the pan to keep the oysters from 



Oysters. 177 



sticking ; cook two or three minutes, or till plump. Sen-e 
on toasted crackers. 

Creamed Oysters. — Make one cup of thick cream sauce 
(see page 190), and season with salt^ pepper^ cayenne.^ and 
celery salt. Wash and pick over one pint of oysters^ and 
parboil until plump. Skim carefully ; drain and add them 
to the sauce. Serve on toast, ^ and garnish the dish with 
points of toast ; or the toast may be omitted, and bread 
crumbs browned in butter sprinkled over the oysters. 
When served in patty shells or in a vol-au-vent, make the 
cream sauce thicker. 

Fricasseed Oysters. — Cook one pint of oysters in hot but- 
ter^ till plump, as directed for smothered oysters. Drain, 
and keep the oysters hot, and add enough cream to the 
03'ster liquor to make one cupful. Cook one tablespoonfid 
of flour in one tablespoonful of hot butter. Add slowh' the 
hot cream and oyster liquor. Season with one teaspoonful 
of lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Pour the sauce 
into one well-beaten egg^ add the hot oysters, and heat one 
minute. Serve on toast, if for breakfast ; or in paper 
cases, OY patties, if for lunch or dinner. 

Scalloped Oysters. — One pint of solid oysters, washed 
and drained ; one third of a cup of melted butter; one cup of 
cracker or stale bread crumbs, moistened in the melted but- 
ter. Butter a shallow dish ; put in a layer of crumbs, 
then a layer of 03'sters ; season with salt and pepper; and, 
if 3'ou like, add Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, wine, or 
mace. Then put in another laver of crumbs, then 03'sters 
and seasoning, with a thick .la3'er of crumbs on the top. 
Bake in a hot oven about twent3' minutes, until the crumbs 
are brown. Many prefer to heat the oyster liquor and 
the butter with an equal quantit3' of milk or cream, and 
use more cracker. Moisten each la3'er of cracker with the 
hot liquid. Reserve the larger part of the butter for the 
top layer of crumbs. In this way a larger dish may be 
prepared with the same quantity of oysters. 

Oysters en Coquille. — Prepare as for scalloped oysters. 
Put one or two ver3^ large or several smaller 03'sters in 



178 The Boston Cook Book. 

oyster or scallop shells ; season, and cover with buttered 
crumbs. Bake till the crumbs are brown. Place the shells 
on small plates, and serve one to each person. 

Large scallop shells ma}' be obtained at the fish market, 
then cleaned and used several times. Tin, granite, or 
silver shells ma}' also be used. 

Oysters and Mushrooms in Crusts. — Bake Parker- House- 
roll dough in round pans, or as small round biscuit placed 
some distance apart. When cold, cut a slice from the top 
of each, and remove the soft inside without breaking 
through the crust. Fill with the following mixture : — 

Parboil half a pint oi oysters. Strain, and save the liquor. 
Cut the 03^sters fine, and mix with them half a can of 
chopped mushrooms. Mix the 03'ster Hquor and mush- 
room juice with enough cream to make one pint in all. 
Pour this hot liquid slowly on one tahlespoonful of butter 
and three of flour cooked together. Season highly with 
salt, pepper, lemon juice., and cayenne. Pour this into the 
crusts, and serve at once. This dish is acceptable to 
those who cannot eat oysters in puflT-paste patties. 

Pigs in Blankets., or Huitres au Lit. — Season large 03's- 
ters with salt and pepper. Cut very thin slices of fat 
bacon ; wrap each oyster in a slice of bacon, and fasten 
with a wooden skewer. Put in a hot omelet pan, and 
cook just long enough to crisp the bacon. Serve on small 
pieces of delicate toast. 

Fried Oysters. — Wash the 03'sters, drain, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and let them stand twent}' minutes. Roll 
first in seasoned crumbs, then dip in beaten egg mixed with 
one tablespoonful of milk ; roll in crumbs again, and frv one 
minute in smoking hot lard. Drain on paper, and garnish 
with chopped or sliced pickle, or choivchoiv. Serve with cold 
slaw or celery salad. 

Fried 03'sters are much better, and spatter less in frying, 
if parboiled slightl>' and drained before rolling in the 
crumbs. When onl}' a few are wanted, and those espe- 
cially nice, select the large oysters, roll them in fine crumbs, 
then in Mayonnaise dressing, then in crumbs again, and fry. 



Clams. 179 



Sauted Oysters. — Prepare as for ftying, and brown on 
each side in hot butter ; or roll in tlie cracker onlj', and 
brown tliem. 

Oysters in Fritter Batter^ see page 107. 

Broiled Oysters. — Pick over, and drain large 03'sters. 
Dip in melted hatter., then in fine cracker crumbs seasoned 
with satt and pepper. Butter a fine wire gridiron ; put 
the 03'sters in closeh', and broil till the juice flows. Some 
prefer to broil them without the crumbs, but more juice is 
lost in this wa3\ 

Pickled Oysters. — Cook one quart of oysters in their 
liquor, till plump. Remove the 03'sters, and add to the 
liquor half a cup of good cider vinegar. Skim as it boils, 
and add one teaspoonful of salt., two blades of 7nace, ten 
cloves., ten peppercorns., ten allspice berries., and a few grains 
of cayenne pepper. Boil five minutes. Pour the liquor 
over the ovsters, and when cold seal in glass jars, and put 
in a cool dark place. The3' will keep two weeks. 



Clams. 

Thin shell clams, and round shell clams, or quahaugs, 
furnish a delicious and wholesome form of food if eaten 
onh' when fresh. The3' are more easih' opened and have 
a finer flavor when cooked in the shells. 

Steamed Clams. — Wash and scrub the shells. Put them 
in a kettle without water, cover closeh', and cook till the 
shells open. Take them out with a skimmer, pour the 
clam water into a pitcher, and let it settle. Straining is 
not sufficient, as the fine sand will go through the finest 
strainer ; but the water will be clear if care be taken not 
to disturb the sediment. Remove the clams from the 
shells, peel off" the thin skin around the edge, and cut off 
the whole of the black end. Scissors are better than a 
knife for this purpose. Rinse each clam in a httle of the 
clam water, and if ver3' large, cut the tough part into 
small pieces. When the water is clear, pour it into a 
saucepan, add the clams, and heat again till just hot, but 



i8o The Boston Cook Book. 

do not let them boil. Serve with hrown hread^ or toasted 
crackers; and let each person season them to taste with 
melted butter^ 'pejp'per^ and vinegar. 

Scalloped Clams. — Prepare the clams as in steamed 
clams. Make a white sauce, as for fish (see page 189) ; 
put the clams in a shallow dish or in clean shells ; cover 
with the sauce and buttered crumbs., and bake till brown. 

For Clam Soup, Clam Chowder, and Clam Fritters, see 
the Index. 

A Clam Bake. 

An impromptu clam bake may be had at an3^ time at 
low tide along the coast where clams are found. If 3-ou 
wish to have genuine fun, and to know what an appetite 
one can have for the bivalves, make up a pleasant party 
and dig for the clams yourselves. A short thick dress, 
shade hat, rubber boots, — or, better still, no boots at all, 
if you can bring 3'our mind to the comfort of bare feet, 
— a small garden trowel, a fork, and a basket, and you are 
read}'. Let those who are not digging gather a large pile 
of driftwood and seaweed, alwa3's to be found along the 
shore. Select a dozen or more large stones, and of them 
make a level floor ; pile the driftwood upon them, and make 
a good brisk fire to heat the stones thoroughly. When hot 
enough to crackle as you sprinkle water upon them, brush 
off the embers, letting them fall between the stones. Put 
a thin la3'er of seaweed on the hot stones, to keep the 
lower clams from burning. Rinse the clams in salt water 
b}' plunging the basket which contains them in the briny 
pools near hj. Pile them over the hot stones, heaping 
them high in the centre. Cover with a thick la3'er of sea- 
weed, and a piece of old canvas, blanket, carpet, or dry 
leaves, to keep in the steam. The time for baking will 
depend upon the size and quantit}' of the clams. Peep in 
occasionall3^ at those around the edge. When the shells 
are open, the clams are done. The}" are delicious eaten 
from the shell, with no other sauce than their own brin3'^ 
sweetness. Melted butter, pepper, and vinegar should be 



Lobsters. 1 8 1 



ready for those who wish them ; then all may " fall to." 
Fingers must be used. A Rhode Islander would laugh at 
an}^ one trying to use a knife and fork. Pull otf the thin 
skin, take them by the black end, dip them in the prepared 
butter, and bite off close to the end. If you swallow them 
whole, they will not hurt 3'ou. At a genuine Ehode Island 
clam bake, blue-fish, lobsters, crabs, sweet potatoes, and 
ears of sweet corn in their gauz}^ husks are baked with 
the clams. The clam steam gives them a delicious flavor. 
Brown bread is served with the clams, and watermelon for 
dessert completes the feast. 

ScaUops. 

This shell fish has a round, deeply grooved shell. The 
muscle which unites the shell is the onl3-part eaten. Scal- 
lops have a sweet flavor, and are in season during the fall 
and winter. They may be stewed like oysters, but are 
better fried. 

Fried Scallops. — Pick over, and wash quickly ; drain 
between towels ; season Jlne cracker cr-umhs with salt and 
pepper. Dip the scallops in the crumbs, then in beaten egg., 
and again in crumbs. Fr}' in smoking hot fat, and serve 
at once. 

Lobsters. 

The markets are now so well supplied with these deli- 
cious shell fish, that they may be obtained in good condi- 
tion aU the year. The canned lobster is also convenient 
in an emergenc}', for use in soups and salads. Lobsters 
are put alive into boiling salted water, and cooked twenty 
minutes from the time the water boils. The}' should not 
be eaten until cold, and never be kept more than eighteen 
hours after boiling. Lobsters are diflScult of digestion, 
and should be eaten with mustard, cayenne pepper, and 
lemon juice or vinegar. 

To Choose a Lobster. — Select one of medium size, heavy 
in proportion to the size. Those with hard, solid shells, 
streaked with black, will be found full of meat; those wito 



1 82 The Boston Cook Book, 

thin shells are water^'. If the tail spring back quicklv 
when straightened, the lobster is fresh. 

To Open a Lobster. — Wipe the shell with a wet cloth 
Break off the large claws, separate the tail from the bodj 
and the body from the shell, leaving the stomach, or lad}-, 
in the shell ; then remove the small claws. Save the 
green liver and coral. Crush the tail b}' pressing the 
sides together, then pull it open on the under side, and 
take out the meat in one piece. Draw back the flesh 
on the upper end of this meat, and remove the intestinal 
canal, which runs the entire length. This is sometimes 
black, and sometimes the color of the meat. Break off all 
the gills on the bod}- before picking the meat from the 
joints, as the}- are liable to drop off with the meat, and 
are too woolly to be palatable. The gills, stomach, and 
intestines are the only parts not eaten. Break the body 
in the middle, and pick the meat from the joints, being 
careful not to take any of the bones. When the shells of 
the large claws are thin, cut off a strip down the sharp 
edge, and remove the meat whole ; or break them by 
hammering on the edge. Never pound them in the mid- 
dle, as that crushes the meat. If the lobster shell is to 
be used for serving the meat, cut down the under side of 
the tail with a sharp knife, and remove the meat without 
breaking the outside shell. Trim the inside, and clean 
the shell. The body shell may be cleaned, split in halves, 
and trimmed with sharp scissors into the shape of clam 
shells. 

Plain Lobster. — The simplest way of serving lobster is 
by many considered the best. Remove the meat from the 
shell, and arrange in a tasteful manner; or cut it into 
small pieces. Let each person season to taste with salt^ 
pepper^ vinegar., and o//, or melted hitter. 

Stewed I^obster. — Cut the lobster fine ; put it in a stew- 
pan, with a little milh or cream Boil up once ; add one 
tablespoonful of butter^ a little pepper, and serve plain or on 
toasted crackers. Cook lobster just long enough to heat it, 
as a longer cooking renders it tough. 



Crabs. 183 



Creamed Lobster. — For one pint of lobster meat cut fine, 
make one pint o^ white sauce (see page 189). Season with 
salt, cayenne, and lemon. Heat the lobster in the sauce, 
but do not let it boil. Serve on toast. 

Curried Lobster. — Make a curry sauce (see page 190), 
and warm the diced lobster in the sauce. 




Fig. 9. Scalloped Lobster. 

Sccdloped Lobster. — Season one pint of lobster, cut into 
dice, with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix with one cup 
of cream sauce (see page 190) ; fill the lobster shells, using 
the tail shells of two lobsters. Cover the meat wnth 
cracker crumbs, moistened with melted butter. Bake till 
the crumbs are brown. Put the two shells together on a 
platter, with the tail ends out, to loot like a long canoe. 
Lay the small claws over the side to represent oars. Gar- 
nish with parshy. The lobster may also be served in 
scallop shells. 

Devilled Lobster. — The same as the preceding receipt, 
with the addition of more scdt, -pepper, and cayenne ; add, 
also, chopped parsley, onion juice, mustard, and Worcester^ 
shire sauce. 

For Lobster .Soup, Chowder, Cutlets, Croquettes, and Scdad, 
see the Index. 

Crabs. 

These are found near the coast of the Southern and 
Middle States, and are considered such a luxuiy in Marj-- 
land that special means are taken for their propagation. 
They are usually quite expensive in Eastern markets. 



1 84 The Boston Cook Book, 

Crabs, like lobsters, shed their shell aniiuall3\ When the 
new shell is forming, the}^ are called soft shell crabs, and 
are highlj' esteemed bj' epicures. 

Soft Shell Crabs. — Use them onl}^ when freshly caught, 
as the shells harden after twenty-four hours. Pull off the 
sand bags, and the shaggy substance from the side ; then 
wash, and wipe dr3' ; sprinkle with salt and pepper ; roll in 
crumbs^ then in egg^ again in crumbs; and fry in smoking 
hot lard. 

Boiled Crabs. — These should be heavy, of medium size, 
and with stiff joints. Plunge them head first into boiling 
water, and cook fifteen minutes ; then remove the outside 
shells and the shaggy substance, rinse in hot water, and 
arrange on a platter. They are eaten from the shell. 

Scalloped Crabs. — Pick the meat from the shells, mince 
it, and mix with a cream sauce ; season with salt and j)^p- 
per, put the mixture in the crab shell or in scallop shells, 
cover with buttered cracker crumbs^ and bake till brown. 

Devilled Crabs. — Prepare as for scalloped crabs, add- 
ing mustard^ cayenne pepper^ and lemon juice to the 
seasoning. 

Crab Salad. — Mix the meat with a Mayonnaise dresS' 
ing^ pack in the crab shells, and garnish with sliced lemoyi 
and cresses,' 

Shrimps. 

Shrimps and Prawns are found in the summer season on 
the Southern coasts. They are similar in form to a 
lobster, but ver}' small. They should be cooked in boiling 
salted water from five to eight minutes. Remove the 
shells and head ; the part that is eaten resembles in shape 
the tail of a lobster. Thej' are used in fish sauces, and 
are very effective as a garnish. 

Shrimp Salad and Shrimps en Coquille may be prepared 
like lobster. Canned shrimps are generally used in East- 
ern markets. 

Scalloped Shrimps. — Make a tomato sauce (see page 193). 
Pick over one can of shrimps, and heat them in the sauce , 



Terrapin. 185 



add one glass of wine. Turn into a scallop dish, cover 
with buttered crumbs^ and bake till the crumbs are brown. 



Reptiles. 

Fried Frogs. — Frogs are considered a delicacy by those 
who have cultivated a taste for them. If not already pre- 
pared for cooking, remove the skin from the hind legs, 
which is the onlj^ part used. Dip in crumbs, seasoned 
with salt and pepper, then in egg, and again in cnwibs. 
Wipe the bone at the end ; put in a basket, and fry one 
minute in smoking hot fat. Drain, and serve in a circle^. 
around a centre of g^-een peas. Some parboil them three 
minutes in boiling salted water and a little le>7ion juice- 
before frying. 

Frogs' legs may also be broiled, or they may be made 
into a white or brown fricassee, seasoned with inushrooms 
or tomato catchup. 

Terrapin. 

This expensive member of the turtle family is highly- 
prized in Baltimore and Philadelphia, but seldom used 
a New England. Terrapin may be kept alive through 
the winter b^- putting them in a barrel, where they will 
not freeze, and feeding them occasionalh' with vegetable 
parings. Before cooking, soak them in strong salt water. 
Put them alive into boiling water, and boil rapidh' ten 
or fifteen minutes. Remove the black outside skin from 
the shells, and the nails from the claws. Wash in warm 
water ; then put them on again, in fresh boiling water ; 
add a little salt, and boil about three quarters of an hour, 
or until the under shell cracks. Open them carefull}' over 
a bowl to save the gravy, remove the under shell, the sand 
bags, the head, and the gall bladder from the liver. If 
the gall bladder be broken in the process, the whole dish 
will be ruined by the escaping gall. Put the upper shells 
on to boil again in the same water, and boil until tender [ 
watch them cjarefullj', and take each out as soon «^ 



1 86 The Boston Cook Booh. 

tender. Pick the liver and meat from the upper shell, and 
cut into several pieces. The intestines are used with the 
meat in winter, when the turtle is in a torpid condition ; 
but in the summer the}' should be thrown away. Boil the 
intestines hy themselves one hour. This should be pre- 
pared the da}' before. Heat the meat in the gravy. To 
each terrapin add one wineglassful of cream ^ half a cup of 
butter, a little salt, cayenne, and one wineglassful of sherry. 
Use the turtle eggs if there be any ; if not, the yolks of 
two hard-hoiled eggs to each terrapin. Rub smooth, mixing 
with raw yolk enough to make into balls the size of tur- 
tle eggs. Add these and the wine just as you send the 
dish to the table. 

Green Turtle Soup. 

The green turtle is highly prized on account of the deli- 
cious quality of its flesh ; but as it is very large and ex- 
pensive the canned turtle is more generally used. 

One can of green turtle, one quart of brown stock, two 
tablespoonfuls each of butter and flour, one lemon. Cut the 
green fat into dice and lay it aside. Simmer the remain- 
der of the turtle meat in the stock for half an hour. 
Brown the flour in the browned butter, add it to the soup, 
season highly with salt and pepper. Serve with thin slices 
of lemon, egg balls, and the reserved green fat. 

Crab Olio — A Southern Recipe. 
Scald and skin six large, smooth tomatoes, and drain 
on a sieve until the water is out. Chop fine the meat of 
four large crahs and the inside of one egg-plant which 
has been boiled, also the cold tomatoes. Add three eggs, 
slightly beaten, salt and pepper to taste, a id haJf a cup 
of bread crumbs. Cook until warmed through in a 
tablesjjoonful of butter, but do not brown it. Put it into 
the crab shells, cover with buttered crumbs, place the 
shells in a pan, and bake until the crumbs are brown. 



Drawn Butter Sauce. 187 



MEAT AND FISH SAUCES. 

Drawn Butter^ or water and melted butter thickened 
with flour, and seasoned, is the simplest form of a sauce. 

When milk, or cream, or white stock is used in place of 
water, less butter is required, and the sauce is called White^ 
or Cream^ or Bechamel sauce. 

B}' browning the butter, using brown stock, and adding 
diflerent seasoning materials, we have all the varieties of 
Brown sauces. 

Many people fail in making sauces b}' not cooking the 
flour sufficienth', and also b}' serving them with a mass of 
oily butter on the surface. Usualh' the flour is wet to a 
smooth paste and stirred into the boiling liquid. When 
made in this manner, the sauce should boil at least ten min- 
utes to have the flour thoroughh' cooked. But by cooking 
the dry flour in the hot butter the starch in the flour is 
more quickl}^ cooked, and the butter is all absorbed and 
conA^erted into an emulsion. Sauces made in this manner 
are perfectly smooth, free from grease, and have a flne 
flavor. Every one should learn how to make both white 
and brown sauces. They are adapted to nearly ever}' 
form of food. Meats, fish, vegetables, eggs, macaroni, 
rice, toast, etc., are rendered more palatable b}' being 
served with an appropriate sauce. 

Drawn Butter Sauce. 



1 pint hot water or 

white stock. 
% cup butter, scant 



2 tablespoonfuls flour, 
% teaspoonf ul salt. 
3^ saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Put half the butter in a saucepan ; be careful not to let 
it become brown ; when melted, add the dr}' flour, and mix 



1 88 The Boston Cook Book. 

well. Add the hot water, a little at a time, and stir 
rapidly as it thickens. When perfectly smooth, add the 
remainder of the butter in small pieces, and stir till it is 
absorbed. Add the salt and pepper. AVhen carefully 
made, this sauce should be free from lumps ; but if not 
smooth, strain it before serving. 

The following sauces may be made with one pint of 
this plain drawn butter as a foundation : — 

Caper Sauce (for Boiled Mutton). — Add six taUespoon- 
fuls of capers. Pichled Nasturtium seeds may be used in 
place of capers. 

Egg Sauce (for Baked or Boiled Fish). — Add two or 
three hard-boiled eggs^ sliced or chopped. 

Parsley Sauce (for Boiled Fish or Fowls). — Add two 
tahle spoonfuls of chopped parsley. 

Lemon Sauce (for Boiled Fowl). — Add the juice and 
pulp of one large lemon ^ and the chicken liver boiled and 
mashed fine. 

Shrimp Sauce (for Fish) . — Add hcdf a pint of shrimps^ 
whole or chopped, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice ^ and a few 
grains of cayenne pepper. 

Acid Sauce. — Add one tahlespoonful of lemon juice or 
vinegar., and a few grains of cayenne pepper. 

Mustard Sauce (for Devilled Turkey, Salt Fish, etc.). — 
Add three tahlespoonfuls of mixed mustard and a little cayenne 
pepper. 

Lobster Sauce (for Boiled Fish). — One pint of lobster 
meat^ cut into quarter-inch dice. Put the inner shells and 
scraggy parts in one and a half pints of cold water, and 
boil fifteen minutes. Strain and use the water in making 
one pint of drawn butter sauce. Add the lobster dice, the 
di'ied and powdered coral, a little cayenne pepper, and 
two tablespoonfids of lemon juice. 

Oyster Sauce (for Boiled Fish, Turke}', or Chicken). — 
Parboil one pint of oysters ; drain, and use the oyster liquor 
in making one pint of drawn hitter sauce. Season with 
celery salt and cayenne pepper. Add the 03'sters ; cook one 
minute longer, and pour it over the fish or chicken. Add 



White Sauce. 



the beaten 3'olk of one egg or one glass of claret tcine, if jou 
wish a richer sauce. 

Oelerg Saitce (for Boiled Fowl). — One pint of the ten- 
der part of celery^ cut very fine. Cook in boiling salted 
water, enough to cover, till tender. Drain ; add enough 
hot water to that in which the celery was cooked to make 
a pint, and use it in making one pint of drawn butter 
sauce. Add the cooked celery and the seasoning. 

Richer Drawn Butter Sauce. — Make a plain drawn 
butter sauce ^ and when ready to serve, pour it boiling hot 
into the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. Stir thoroughly, 
season to taste, and serve at once. 

Sauce Piquante. — Add one tablespoonful each of vinegar 
and lemon juice., two tablespoonfuls each of chopped capers^ 
pickles., and olives^ half a teaspoonful of onion juice., and a 
few grains of cayenne pepper., to one pint of drawn butter. 

White Sauce (for Vegetables, Chicken, Eggs, etc.). 



1 pint milk, or half milk and half 
white stock. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 



2 heaping tablespoonfuls flour. 
}.2 teaspoonful salt. 
3-2 saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Heat the milk over hot water. Put the butter in a 
granite saucepan, and stir till it melts and bubbles. Be 
careful not to brown it. Add the dry flour, and stir 
quickly till well mixed. Pour on one third of the milk. 
Let it boil, and stir well as it thickens ; tip the saucepan 
slightly to keep the sauce from sticking. Add another 
third of the milk ; let it boil up and thicken, and stir vig- 
orously till perfectly smooth. Be sure that all the lumps 
are rubbed out while it is in this thick state. Then add 
the remainder of the milk ; let it boil, and when smooth 
add the salt and pepper, using more if high seasoning be 
desired. 

This white sauce may be used in place of drawn butter 
in any of the preceding rules.

Eggs, 197 



EGG-S. 

Whatever else 3'ou maj' economize in, do not limit your 
famil}' in respect to eggs. They are nutritious, and even 
at four cents each are cheaper than meat. The}^ should 
be used freel}' by all except those who know thej^ cannot 
digest them. Using freely does not mean their unnecessary 
or extravagant use in rich cakes, custards, etc., nor in the 
indigestible form of fried or what is ordinaril}' called hard- 
boiled eggs ; but it means the frequent use of them in any 
of the simple forms of boiling, baking, omelets, plain cake, 
and other wholesome combinations. It is very poor econ- 
omy', especiaUy for those who keep hens, to exchange eggs 
for corned beef or salt fish ; or to use soda and cream of 
tai-tar as a substitute for eggs in sponge cake, or half- 
cooked flour in an omelet. The}^ ma}^ be served in an 
unlimited variety of styles, are especially suitable for 
breakfast or lunch, attractive as a garnish, and when 
combined with sugar and milk make the most healthful 
puddings, desserts, or tea dishes. 

But though a type of perfect food, eggs are not intended 
to be eaten exclusively, am' more than other foods. They 
are one of the most highh' concentrated forms of food, and, 
being wholly destitute of starch, should be eaten with 
bread or rice 

The white of the Qgg has but a trace of fat in it, and 
requires the addition of butter, milk, or fat meat, like 
bacon or ham- The white of egg contains water, mineral 
ingredients, and soluble albumen ; the yolk has, in addi- 
tion to these, oil and sulphur. The albumen is enclosed 
in layers of thin-walled cells. When beaten, these walls 
break, and the albumen, owing to its glutinous nature, 
catches and holds the air, and increases to man}' times its 
original bulk. 



193 The Boston Cook Booh, 

Do not use an egg till it has been laid ten hours, as the 
white does not become set or thick till then, and cannot be 
beaten stiff. Eggs for poaching or boiling are best when 
thirty-six hours old. Albumen, when heated, becomes a 
dense solid ; if mixed and heated with a liquid, it hardens 
and entangles in its meshes any solids or impurities in the 
liquid, and rises to the surface with them as scum, or pre 
cipitates them. It is thus the white of egg clears soups^ 
jellies, and coffee. Strong acids, corrosive sublimate, 
and creosote will also coagulate albumen ; and there- 
fore, if an}^ of these poisons be taken into the system, 
the white of egg, swallowed quicklj', will combine with 
the poison and protect the stomach. 

The shells of newly laid eggs are almost full ; but as 
the shells are porous, on exposure to the air, the water 
inside evaporates, and the eggs grow^ lighter, while air 
rushes in to fill the place of the water, and causes the 
nitrogenous elements to decompose, and the eggs soon 
spoil. This explains why a good egg is heavy, and will 
sink in water; and why a stale Qg^ is lighter, has a 
rattling or gurgling sound, and floats in the water. An}'- 
thing which will fill up the pores and thus exclude the 
air, when applied to perfectly fresh eggs, will preserve 
them indefinitely ; a coating of hquid fat or gum, or a 
packing in Dran or salt, with the small end downward, is 
effectual. Eggs should be kept in a cool, dark place, 
and handled carefully, as any rough motion may cause 
the white and yolk to become mixed, by rupturing the 
membrane which separates them, and then the egg spoils 
quickly. 

Never buy eggs about the freshness of which you have 
any doubt, not even in winter. One can easily judge 
which is the better economy, — to pay twenty-five or thirty 
cents a dozen, and find none of them full and fresh, and 
perhaps half of them really rotten ; or to pay fifty cents, 
and obtain them freshly laid, — not merely fresh from the 
country, —and all sound and good. Eggs with a dark 
shell are richer and have larger yolks. Eggs are of better 



Boiled Eggs, 199 



flavor and more palatable in the spring, but are good 
and suitable, if perfectlj- fresh, at an}- season. 

BoUed Eggs (the Best Way). 

Put the eggs in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, 
and let them stand about ten minutes where the water 
will keep hot (180°), but not boiling. The white should 
be of a soft jelh-like consistenc}', and the j'olk soft but 
not liquid. Experience will show the exact time to keep 
the eggs in the water to suit individual tastes. The}'^ 
should be served immediately^, as the}' harden by being 
kept in the hot shell. An Qg,g^ to be cooked soft, should 
never be cooked in hoiling water ^ as the white hardens un- 
eveni}' before the heat reaches the yolk. 

Hard-boiled Eggs. — Cook eggs for twenty minutes in 
water just below the boiling-point, for use in any receipt 
which specifies hard-boiled eggs. The 3'olk of an egg cooked 
ten minutes is tough and indigestible ; twenty minutes will 
make the 3'olk dry and mealy ; then it ma}' be more easily 
rubbed smooth for salad or other mixtures, and more 
quickly penetrated by the gastric fluid. If the shell of an 
Ggg be cracked before boiling, pierce several small holes 
in the large end to keep the contents from bursting out at 
the crack. 

Dropped or Poached Eggs on Toast. 

Toast a slice of bread for each egg, and trim neatly, or 
cut with a round cutter before toasting. Have a very 
clean shallow pan nearly full of salted and boiling water. 
Remove all the scum, and let the water simmer. Break 
each egg carefully into a cup, and slip it gently into the 
water. Dip the water over them with a spoon, and when 
a film has formed on the yolk and the white is firm, take 
each up with a skimmer ; drain, trim the edges, and place 
on the toast. Put a bit of butter and a little salt and 
pepper on each egg ; or make a thin cream sauce and 
pour it around them. Put a tablespoonful of lemoii juice 



200 The Boston Cook Book, 

in the water, or poach the eggs in muffin-rings to give 
them a better shape. An egg-poacher, something like a 
castor with perfoi-ated cups, is very convenient. 

2^0. 2. — Spread the toast with butter and anchovy 
paste or sardine paste ^ and serve a poached egg on each 
slice ; or spread the toast with potted or finely minced 
boiled ham. 

Ham and Eggs. — Serve poached eggs on thin slices of 
broiled ov fried Jiam ; when served on hot, highly seasoned 
boiled rice^ they are called Spanish Eggs. 

Eggs poached in Tomatoes^ or a la Dauphine. {M. L. 
Clarke.) — Stew slowl}^ for ten minutes half a can of toma- 
toes and one small onion, cut fine. Season highty with salt 
and pepper and butter. Break six erjgs into a bowl with- 
out beating, and when everything else is ready to serve 
slip them into the hot tomatoes. Lift the white care- 
fully with a fork, as it cooks, until it is all firm; then 
prick the yolks and let them mix with the tomato and 
white. It should be quite soft, but with tlie red toma- 
toes, the white and yellow of the egg, quite distinct. 
Serve at once on toast. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Beat four eggs slightly with a fork ; 
add half a teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonfid of pepper, 
and half a cup of milk. Turn into a hot buttered omelet 
pan and cook quickly, stirring all the time till the egg is 
firm but soft. Serve on toast or with hot minced ham or 
veal. Any of the ingredients given in fancy omelets may 
be mixed with the beaten eggs before cooking. 

No. 2. — Put a tablespoonful of butter in an omelet pan : 
when hot, add three whole eggs ; stir quickly till the mix- 
ture is firm but soft. Add a little salt and pepper, and 
serve at once. 

Omelets. 

Beat the yolks of two eggs till light- colored and thick ; 
add two tablespoonfuls of milk, one saltspoonfid of salt, and 
one fourth of a saltspoonful of pepper. Beat the ivhitei 
of two eggs till stiff" and dry. Cut and fold them lightly 
into the yolks till just covered. Have a clean, smooth

omelet pan. When hot, rub it round the edge' with a 
teaspoonful of butter on a broad knife ; let the butter run 
all over the pan and when bubbling turn in the omelet 
quickly- and spread it evenly on the pan. Lift the pan 
from the hottest part of the fire and cook carefully, until 
slightly browned

run a knife round the edge, then under the half nearest 
the handle, and fold over to the right. Hold the edge of 
a hot platter against the lower edge of the pan, and in- 
vert the omelet upon the platter. Or add only half of the 
beaten whites to the 3'olks, and when nearl}^ cooked spread 
the remainder over tlie top ; let it heat through ; fold over, 
and the white will burst out round the edge like a border 
of foam, making a foam omelet, or any fanc}' name you may 
choose to give it. 

If 3'Ou have no omelet pan, or no convenience foi* dr}'- 
ing the omelet in the oven, use a smooth iron spider or 
frying-pan with a tin cover, and double the quantities 
given. Heat the pan and the cover very hot. Butter the 
pan, turn in the mixture, cover it, and place on the back 
of the stove for five minutes, or till firm. Fold as usual. 
Omelets should be only slightly browned, never burned, 
as the flavor of scorched egg is not agreeable. 

One tahlespoonfid of chopped parsley, or a teaspoonful of 
fine grated onion, or two or three tablespoonfuls of grated 
sweet com ma}' be added to the 3'olks before cooking. 

Thin slices of cold ham, or three spoonfids of chopped ham, 
veal, or chichen ; steived tomatoes or raw tomatoes sliced; 
chopped mushrooms, shrimps, oysters which have been par

jy-Q. 2. Beat six eggs until Ught and foamy with a Dover 

effg-beater ; add half a teaspoonful of salt and 07ie scant salt- 
spoonful of pepper, and one cup of milk. Fry a large spoon- 
ful at a time in a hot pan or on a griddle, and roll over 
quickly like a French pancake. This is a convenient way 
where the family come irregularly to breakfast. The mix- 
ture may stand for some time if beaten again thoroughly 
before frying. 

Creamy Omelet. {Mrs. Ewing.) — Beat/oz«r eggs slightly 
with a spoon till you can take up a spoonful. Add a 
scant half-teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonfid of pepper, 
four tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, and mix well. Butter 
a hot omelet pan, and before the butter browns turn in 
the mixture. Then with the point of a fork pick or Uft 
up the cooked egg from the centre and let the uncooked 
egg run under. This leaves the butter on the pan, and 
is better than stirring. Continue the lifting until the whole 
is of a soft creamy consistency; then place it over a 
hotter part of the fire to brown slightly ; fold and turn out 
as usual. 

Sweet or Jelly Omelet. — Allow a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar to each egg, and omit the pepper. Mix and cook 
as in Omelet No. 1, and when ready to fold put tivo or 
three tablespoonfuls of any kind of preserves, marmalade, 
or jelly on the top. Fold and sprinkle with sugar. 

Oi'ange Omelet. — The thinly 
grated rind of one orange and 
three tahlespoonfids of the 
juice, three eggs, and three tea- 
spoonfuls of poivdered sugar. 
FIG. 11. orange Omelet. Beat the yolks; add the sugar,

in Omelet, No. 1. Fold, turn out, sprinkle thickly 
with powdered sugar, and score in diagonal lines with a 
clean red-hot poker. The burnt sugar gives to the omelet

a delicious flavor. Or cut the orange into sections, re- 
move the seeds and tough inner skin ; cut each section 
into pieces, and mix with the 3'olks before cooking ; or 
spread part of the orange over the omelet before folding, 
and sprinkle the remainder over the sugared top. 

This is a convenient dessert for an emergency, and may 
be prepared in ten minutes if one have the oranges. 

Omelet Soiiffie. — Allow a heaping teaspoonful of pow^ 
dered sugar, a few drops of lemon or vanilla for flavoring, 
and two ivhites to each yolk. To make a small omelet, 
beat the yolks of two eggs till light and thick ; add two 
heaping teaspoonfuls oi powdered sugar and half a teaspoon- 
ful of lemon or vanilla. Beat the whites of four eggs till 
stiff and dr^', and fold them lightly into the yolks. Put it 
b}^ the tablespoonfuls lightly into a well-buttered baking- 
dish. Cook in a moderate oven about twelve minutes, or 
till well puffed up and a straw comes out clean. Serve at 
once, as it falls quickly. 



Baked Eggs. 

Small stone china dishes or egg-shirrers, holding one oi 
two eggs for each person, are convenient for this method 
of serving eggs ; or use a common platter placed over hot 
water ; or bake in the shells in a moderate oven ten minutes, 
first pricking several holes with a large pin in the large end 
of the egg., to keep the air within from bursting the shell 
as it expands. 

No. 1. — Break each egg into a cup, being careful not to 
break the 3'olk, and put the eggs on a hot buttered dish 
suitable for serving. Put a little salt on each egg. Bake 
until the white is firm. Add a little butter and serve 
at once. Garnish each egg with thin strips of breakfast 
bacon. 

No. 2. — Cover the buttered dish with^?2e cracker crumbs. 
Put each egg carefull}- in the dish, and cover lightl}' with 
seasoned and battered crumbs. Bake till the crumbs are 
brown. 



204 ^^^ Boston Cook Booh, 

No. 3. — Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and 
salt slightly-. Spread it roughlj' on a pkitter ; make a 
nest or cavity for each 3'olk some distance apart. Season, 
and bake till the white is brown. 

No. 4. — Cover the dish with any poultry gravy 3'ou may 
chance to have, or with white sauce., and have a slice of 
toast or bread sauted for each egg. Set the platter in the 
oven over a pan of hot water, and when toast and gravy 
are hot drop the eggs on the toast, and bake till the eggs 
are set. 

Eggs en CoquiUe. — Cut slices o^ stale bread in large rounds ; 
then with a smaller cutter cut half-wa}^ through and scoop 
out the centre, leaving them shaped like a pate shell, with 
the cavity large enough to hold one Q^g. Dip these bread 
shells in raw egg., beaten with a little milk., and saute, or 
fry them in hot fat. Put them on a platter covered with 
hot white sauce or poultry gravy., and serve a poached egg 
in each shell ; or put a raw egg in each and bake till the 
eggs are set. Half a cup of chopped or sliced mushrooms 
may be cooked in the grav}^ The shells ma}^ be toasted if 
you prefer. 

No, 2. — Take half a cup of soft bread crumbs^ an equal 
amount of fine chopped ham or tongue., and a WttXe pepper., 
salt., parsley., mustard., and melted butter. Make it into a 
smooth paste with hot milk or cream. Spread the mixture 
on some scallop shells. Break the eggs carefully, and put 
one in the centre of each shell ; sprinkle with a little salt 
and pepper., s^ndfine cracker crumbs moistened with melted 
butter. Set in the oven, and bake five or six minutes, or 
until the Qgg is firm. Or put the bread and meat mixture 
in a baking-dish, shaping it a httle to hold six or seven 
raiv eggs ; cover lightly with buttered crumbs, and bake till 
the whites of the eggs are firm. 

Eggs and Minced Meat. — Chop one pint of cold chicken, 
ham, or veal fine, and rub it to a smooth paste ; add o?ie table- 
spoonful of melted butter, one tahlespoonful of chopped parsley, 
salt SiUQl pepper to taste, and two beaten eggs. If too dry, 
moisten with a little cream or stock or gravy, but do not

have it too soft to shape. Heat it in a fiying-pan just 
enough to warm through, letting it dry off if too moist. 
Form it on a hot platter into a flat mound ; hollow the cen- 
tre, leaving a ridge of the mixture round the edge. Keep 
it hot, and put three or four poached eggs in the centre.

Garnish with triangles of toast laid round the base of the 
meat. Or, if you have a larger quantitv of meat, prepare 
as above, and make a mound one inch deep on a round 
dish and a smaller mound above that, and place eggs 
baked in cups, or hard-boiled eggs cut in halves, or G^g 
baskets on the space between the mounds. Garnish with 
parsley. 

Pannikins. — Warm minced ham or tongne ov veal in 2i 
thick cream sauce, and pile it in the centre of a platter. 
Heat and butter some earthen cups, break an egg in each, 
and bake till the egg is firm. Turn them out and arrange 
round the meat. 



Various Ways of Serving Hard-boiled Eggs. 

Curried Eggs. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Remove 
the shells and cut into halves or slices. Fr}* one teaspoon- 
fal of chopped onion in one tahlespoonful of butter., being 
careful not to burn it ; add one heaping tahlespoonful of 
f,our or one even tablespoonfid of cornstarch mixed with halj 
a tahlespoonful of curry poioder. Pour on slowl}' one cup 
and a hcdf of ichite stock or milk or cream ; add salt and 
pepper to taste. Simmer till the onions are soft. Add

the eggs, and when warmed through serve in a shallow 
dish ; or arrange the eggs on hot toast ^ and pour the 
sauce over them ; or cover with buttered crumbs and bake 
till the crumbs are brown. 

Egg Vermicelli. — Boil three eggs twentj' minutes. Sepa- 
rate the 3'olks and chop the whites fine. Toast four slices 
of bread; cut half into small squares and half into points 
or triangles. Make one cup of thiii white sauce with one 
cup of cream or milk, one teaspoonful of butter, one heaping 
teaspoonful of flour, half a teaspoonfid of salt, and half a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Stir the whites into the sauce, and 
when hot pour it over the squares of toast. Rub the 
yolks through a fine strainer over the whole, and garnish 
with a border of toast points and a bit of parsley in the 
centre. 

Or cut the bread into rounds before toasting. Pour the 
white sauce on the hot platter, and put the rounds of toast 
on the sauce some distance apart. Put a little of the 
chopped white on each slice, pile it high on the edge, rub 
the yolks through a fine strainer over the centre, and laj- 
small sprigs of fine parsle}^ between the toast. 

Stuffed Eggs. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Re- 
move the shells and cut carefully lengthwise. Remove 
the yolks, and put the two whites of each egg together, 

that the}' ma}^ not become 
mixed. Mash the yolks, 
and add one teaspoonful of 
soft butter, a few drops of 
onion juice, and half the 
quantity of potted or dev-

minced chicken, lamb, or veal 
be used, season to taste with salt, pepper, mustard, and 
cayenne or chopped parsley. Fill the whites with the mix- 
ture, smooth them, and press the two halves together, 
being careful to fit them just as they were cut. Spread 
the remainder of the yolk mixture on a shallow dish and 
place the eggs on H. Cover with a thin ivhite sauce, or

any chicken or veal gravy ; sprinkle buttered crumbs over the 
whole, and bake till the crumbs are a delicate brown. 

No. 2. — After the ego^s are filled with the mixture and 
put together as above, roll each egg in fine bread crumbs 
and beaten egg and in crumbs again, then repeat the pro- 
cess, and fly in smoking hot fat. Drain, and serve hot 
with tomato sauce or garnished with parsley. 

Scotch Eggs. — One cup of lean cooked ham chopped 
ver}^ fine ; six hard-boiled eggs. Cook one third of a cup of 
stale bread cimmbs in one third of a cup of milk to a smooth 
paste. Mix it with the ham ; add half a teaspoonful of 
mixed mustard., half a saltspoonful of cayenne., and one raw 
egg. Mix well., remove the shells from the eggs, and cover 
with the mixture. Fry in hot fat two minutes. Drain, 
and serve hot or cold, for lunch or picnics. Cut them into 
halves lengthwise, and arrange each half on a bed of fine 
parsley. The contrast between the green, red, white, and 
3^ellow gives a \Qvy prett}' effect. 

No. 2. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make a force- 
meat with one cup of an}' kind of cold meat fineh' chopped, 
half a cup of soft bread cruynbs cooked to a paste, in one 
third of a cup of milk and one raw egg., beaten light, using 
just enough of the ^^,g to unite the mixture, being careful 
not to have it too soft. 

If chicken be used, season with chopped parsley and a 
pinch of herbs; season ham with mustard and cayenne; 
veal., with lemon juice or horseradish; and salmon, with 
lemon and cayenne. 

Divide the eggs crosswise or lengthwise, or leave them 
whole. Cover each half or whole egg thickly with the 
force-meat, and place them on a buttered tin pan and bake 
in a hot oven till slightl}' browned. Arrange on a hot 
platter with a white sauce poured around (not over) them. 

Scalloped Eggs. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make 
one pint of white sauce with stock and cream or milk, and 
season to taste. Moisten one cup oi fine cracker crumbs 
in one fourth of a cup of melted butter or cream. Chop 
fine one cup of ham., tongue., poultry^ or fish. Remove the 



2o8 The Boston Cook Book 

yolks of the eggs, and chop the whites fine. Put a layer of 
buttered crumbs in a buttered scallop dish, then a la3'er of 
chopped whites, white sauce, minced meat, yolks rubbed 
throuo-h a fine strainer, and so on, until the material is all 
used, having the buttered crumbs on the top. Bake till 
the crumbs are brown. 

Egg Balls in Baskets. — Boil three eggs twenty minutes. 
Remove the shells, cut off a thin slice at each end, that 
the eggs may stand upright, and cut in halves crosswise. 
Remove the yolks, and stand the cups or baskets thus made 
around the edge of a platter. Rub the yolks to a smooth 
paste ; add an equal amount of cooked hajn or tongue, 
chopped fine, one tablespoonful of melted butter, salt, pep- 
per, and mustard to taste. Make into balls the size of 
the original yolks, and fill the cups. Make one cup of 
white sauce, w4th cream or milk and white stock, seasoned 
with salt and pepper. Pour it in the centre of the eggs. 
Set the platter in the oven a few minutes, and when ready 
to serve put a tiny bit of parsley on each ball. 

In place of the meat, 3'ou may use, if you prefer, two 
tablespoon/ids of grated cheese, a speck of cayenne pepper, 
and moisten with vinegar and olive oil. 

Eggs k la Creme. 

Boil three eggs twenty minutes. Cut off a slice at each 
end, and cut the eggs in halves crosswise. Remove the 

3'olks, and cut them in 
thin slices. Mix with 
them an equal amount 
of small thin pieces of 
cold chicken, ham, salmon, 
or lobster, and season to 
taste. Fill the white 
cups with the mixture. Place them on a shallow dish and 
pour one cup of thick cream sauce (page 190) around them. 
The sauce should come nearly to the top of the cups. Or 
cut the eggs in halves, and place them with the cut side 
down and serve in the sauce. 




Fig. l-i. Eggs a la Creme. 



Fancy Eggs. 209 



Eggs in a Nest. 

Boil six eggs twent}' minutes. Remove the shells. 
Separate the yolks without breaking ; or rub them to a 
smooth paste with a little olive oil to moisten, and 
shape into small balls. Cut the whites in thin narrow 
slices, and mix with them an equal quantitj^ of jine 
shredded chicken^ ham^ or salmon^ and a tahlespoonfid of fine 
sprigs of parsley. Pile this mixture, which should be hght 
and drj', on a platter in a circular or oval ring, and put 
the yolks in the centre. Set the platter in a steamer, to 
heat the mixture. Make a pint of thick white sauce ; pour 
enough of it round the edge of the dish to come half-wa}' 
up the nest, and serve the remainder in a sauce-boat. 

The same materials may be served cold as Devilled 
Eggs. Mix a httle cayenne pepper and made mustard with 
the yolks and also with the shredded meat ; add a sprink- 
ling of vinegar., and garnish the dish w^ith parsley or water- 
cresses. Or serve as a salad, garnished with cresses or 
lettuce., and sprinkle a French dressing over the whole. 

Egg Salad ma}' be served in this form. Cut the yolks in 
dice, and mix them lightly with diced chicken, salmon, fish., 
or lobster; fill the white cups heaping with the mixture, 
and serve on a hed of lettuce or cresses, with French or 
Mayonnaise dressing. 

Egg Timbales. 
Beat six eggs lightly with fork till well mixed, add one 
and one-half cups of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper, one teaspoonful of minced parsley, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of onion juice ; stir all well, pour into well-buttered 
moulds, — set in pan of hot water, and cook in moderate 
oven till firm. Serve with either cream or tomato sauce. 

Hot Eggs. 
Into a hot bowl kept in very hot water break tico eggs, 
add one teaspoon of butter and a dash of salt and pepper, 
beat them slightly, and when they taste hot, serve at 
once. Excellent when nourishment is needed quickly.

MEAT. 

Meat is a general term applied to the flesh of animals 
used for food. It includes the muscular flesh, sinews, fat, 
heart, liver, stomach, brains, and tongue. Meat is divided 
into three classes : — 

Meat^ including beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork. 

Poultry^ including chicken, turkey, geese, and ducks, or 
all domestic fowls. 

Game^ including partridges, grouse, pigeons, quail, or 
other birds, venison, and an}^ wild meat that is hunted 
in the forest or field. 

Meat consists of several substances, — jibrine^ albumen, 
gelatine, fat, and \hQ juice of flesh. 

Fibrins exists in the blood and flesh. In the former 
it is soluble, owing to the alkaline nature of the blood ; 
it is deposited b}^ the blood, matrle into flesh, and becomes 
insoluble flesh-fibrine, and forms the basis or fibre of mus- 
cular tissue. It is separated into bundles b}^ membranes, 
and into larger separate masses by cellular tissue, in 
which fat is deposited. Its true color is white ; but the 
blood in the veins which penetrate every part of the fibre 
gives it a reddish tinge. This may be seen by washhig 
a piece of lean meat in cold water. The red coloring 
matter is soon drawn into the water, and the meat is a 
mass of white fibre. Fibrine is hardened and contracted 
by intense heat, but softened by moderate and long- 
continued heat. Meat that has tough fibre should simmer 
and not boil. 

Albumen exists in the flesh and in the blood. It is the 
soluble portion of the flesh. It dissolves in cold water, 
but hardens in hot water. 

Gelatine is a peculiar substance found in the tendons 



Meat. 211 

and gristly parts of flesh, the shin, and the sinewy parts 
about the joints, and in the nutritive parts of bones. It 
may be dissolved b^^ soaking in cold water, and then boil- 
ing gently for several hours. The solution hardens when 
cold. Gelatine hardens in a dry heat, and such parts of 
meat as contain it in abundance should be stewed, rather 
than roasted or broiled. 

Fat of meat is contained, a good measure of it, in the 
adipose tissue of almost all flesh which is used as food. 
It is liquefied by heat, and resolved into various acid and 
acrid bodies. It is a warmth-giver, and is therefore most 
appropriately used in cold seasons and climates. 

The juice of the flesh consists of water, a small propor- 
tion of albumen, and a mixture of other compounds. It 
is not the blood, for it still exists after the blood has been 
withdrawn. It ma}' be obtained b}' chopping lean meat 
fine, putting it in a closel}' covered jar without water, and 
heating it gradually. If heated above 160°, the albumi- 
nous matters in it harden and turn brown. The solid 
residue, consisting of fibres, tissue, etc., is white, tasteless, 
and inodorous. This separated juice is strongh' acid, 
while the blood is always alkaline. It contains many sub- 
stances which are very valuable as food, and the savor}' 
principle, or ozmazome^ which gives flavor to the meat and 
causes it to difier in difi'erent animals. Meat should 
always be cooked in such a manner as to retain the largest 
proportion of this juice. The juice is drawn out into the 
brine in salting, and this renders salt meat less nutritious. 
The juice when the water has been separated from it by 
evaporation, is termed extract of meat. 

The flesh of all young animals is more tender, but not 
so nutritious as that of maturer animals. Nearly all parts 
of an animal may be used as food. 

Meat is in season all the year ; but certain kinds are 
better at 'stated times. Porh is good only in autumn and 
winter ; veal., in the spring and summer ; venison^ in the 
winter ; fowls, in autumn and winter ; Iamb, in the summer 
and fall ; mutton and beef 0,1 any time.

213 



All meat should be removed from the brown paper iu 
which it is wrapped as soon as it comes from the market, 
or it will taste of the paper and the paper will absorb the 
meat juices. Wipe all over with a clean wet cloth. 
Chops and steaks will keep sweet much longer if examined 
at once, and an}- parts that are not clean and sweet 
removed. In warm weather look at the meat often. Put 
it on a dish near, but never directh' upon, the ice.

BEEF. 



Good beef should be bright red, well marbled with j^el- 
lowish-white fat, and with a thick outside layer of fat. 
The flesh must be firm, and when pressed with the finger 
no mark should be left. The suet should be dr}', and 
crumble easily. 

A side of beef is divided into the hind quarter and 
fore quarter. The hind quarter consists of the round, 
the rump, and the loin. The fore quarter is divided 
into the back half and the rattle rand. In cutting up a 
hind quarter, the flank is first removed. The cut should 
slant two or three inches toward the tip. The upper part 

of the flank has 
the ends of the 
short ribs, and is 
used for corning. 
The lower end of 
the flank has no 
bones. This may 
be stuff'ed, rolled, 
and boiled, either 
fresh or corned. 
The round is sep- 
arated from the 
rump in the line 
from 7 to 9. The aitch bone (7) lies between the back 
and middle cut of the rump and the top of the round. It 
is usually sold whole ; it makes a good roast for a small 
family, considering the price (10 cents), and is the best 
piece for a beef stew. 

The first cuts of the vein (9) which joins the face of 
the rump make good steak. The top of the round is 




Fig. 1 



Beef, 215 

the inside of the thickest part of the leg (8^, behind 8 
in the diagram) . As seen on the counter, it is above the 
bone. It consists of one large section or muscle with a 
thick edge of fat. The best round steaks lie between this 
point and the ridge of fat. The third slice is considered 
the best. After cutting beyond this ridge comes the 
beginning of another muscle, which is very tough. One 
ma}' easily detect, by the separation of this narrow strip of 
meat along the top of the slice, whether the meat came 
from the best part of the top of the round. It ma}' be the 




Fig. 18. Round, showing the beginning of the tough muscle on the top. 

best the marketman has ; but it is not the best cut, though 
often palmed off in place of the third slice. The under 
part of the round has two sections or muscles, the one 
nearest the bone being larger than the outside section. 
The skin is thin, with very little fat. Steaks from this cut 
are sometimes sold as good round steak to the ignorant 
Ixiyer ; but keep in mind that in the top cut there is one 
large muscle with thick fat, instead of two smaller muscles 
and thin fat, and you will not be deceived. This under 
cu^ of the round is excellent for braising. It is well shaped, 
requires no trimming, and is the cheapest cut, as every 
scrap of it may be eaten. Below this, as we follow down 
the leg, are nice pieces for stews, pie meat, etc. 

The marrow bone, running through the round to the 
shin, contains the best marrow. The next best is in the

foreshin. The hind shin differs from the fore shin in hav- 
ing a thick tendon, which separates entirel}' from tlie end 
of the leg, and unites again at the joint, forming a loop b}' 
which the hind quarter is hung on the meat hook. The 

middle cut of the 
shin ma}' be used 
for stews and brais- 
ing, and the lower 
part for soups. 

The rump is usu- 
ally separated from 
the loin, and divid- 
ed into the back, 
middle, and face 
of the rump. The 
back of the rump, one of the best pieces for roasting, has 
part of the backbone and sometimes the rump bone, as 
some marketmen will not cut it out before weighing. 
The small end nearest the loin has the most tender meat. 




Fig. 19. Back of Rump. 




Pig. 20. First Cut of Sirloin, showing the bulging muscle 
on upper edge. 



The middle cut has no bone, but it is not 
tender. It is better for braising than for roasting. Some- 
times the rump is not divided, and is cut into steaks. If 
cut parallel with the backbone, it will be tough. If cut at 
right angles, and from the end nearest the loin, it makes the

best steaks, and is well worth the extra price charged for 
cutting in this manner. The face of the rump has a thick 
piece of fat in the middle, often purposely covered by a 
thin cutting from the ten- 
derloin. This is a cheap 
piece for roasting, but not 
of the best quality. 

The sirloin is separated 
from the rump in a slant- 
ing direction. Never bu}' 
the first slice, as it alwaj's 
has a small narrow bone 
near the top in addition to 
the rib, and a larger por- 
tion of tough flank and 
gristle than the middle or 
second cuts. As it lies on 
the counter you may easily 

tell if it be the first slice by the small bone ; and if you 
press on the top of the meat near the middle, a small sec- 
tion of meat bulges out. This is the end of the muscle 
forming the face of the rump and vein, and is very tough. 
The second cut of sirloin has the most tenderloin, and 
onh' a straight rib at right angles with the backbone. 
An}' part after the first slice is taken off, until 3'ou come 
to the tip, is called the second cut, and is sold for roasts 
or steak. The tip is verv juicy. The whole hind-quarter 
is hung up by the shin, the juices all flow down, and the 
tip holds a large portion. The muscles which are the least 
used have the most tender fibre and the least juice. These 
muscles, 13'ing along the loin or middle of the backbone, 
above the ribs, and forming the top of the sirloin, are more 
tender, but less juicy, than those of the rump and round. 
The tenderloin, lying along the middle of the back under 
the sirloin, from below the tip to the face of the rump, is 
protected b}' its bed of suet below, and its roof of bones 
above. It ia a muscle very little used, is verv tender, 
but dry, and entirely' without flavor. This is removed

whole, and sold as the long fillet; or divided, and the 
smaller part, lying under the rump, sold as the short 
fillet.

Remove the fillet, or tenderloin, and cook that first, as it

spoils easily ; corn the flank, or use it for a stew ; and 
roast the upper part. If very large, roast it slightly the 
first time, and it may be roasted again for a second dinner. 

The Fore Quarter. 

The back half of the fore quarter has the backbone on 
the upper edge. The best roasting piece is the first cut of 
the rib, which joins the tip of the sirloin, and is sometimes 
sold for the tip. The tip has only one thick muscle above 
the rib, and the bones are usually slanting. One side of 
the first cut of the rib looks just like the tip ; the other 
side has the beginning of another tough muscle next to the 
skin, and the bones are straight. There are ten ribs in 
the fore quarter ; three are left in the sirloin. This first 
cut may be one, two, three, or four ribs ; but two are 
enough to roast for a small family. The shoulder blade 
begins in the fifth rib, and above this lie what are called 
the chuck ribs. The meat above the blade is tough, and

only suitable for stews. The part underneath is cut into 
small steaks, and is often offered for sale as sirloin steaks. 
The shoulder of mutton, just above the fore shin, is good 
for braising and pie 
meat. 

The rattle rand is 
divided into three 
long narrow strips, 
thick and lean at 
the upper end, and 
thin and fat at the 
lower end, all of 
which are usually 
corned. The upper

part, called the rat- 
tle, is divided into 
three cuts. The 

thick upper end is preferred by those who like lean corned 
beef. The second cut has straight ribs running through it, 
and three distinct laj^ers of meat with fat, and is considered 
the choicest piece hy those who like ' ' a streak of fat and

a streak of lean." The middle strip has a thick layer of 
fat, and only one layer of lean, and the bones are slantingv 
This is not a desirable piece. The lower strip is the 
brisket, the upper end of which is thick ; the lower end,

toward the middle of the creature, is called the navel end. 
Brisket pieces alwa3's have what is called a selvedge on 
the lower side, and the breast bones running at right angles 
with the rib. After a little experience in marketing one 
m2ij easil}' distinguish the various cuts of beef. It is well 
to know what you want, and to know whether you get 
what you have ordered. 

Roast Sirloin of Beef. 

Six or eight pounds from the tip or second cut of the sirloin. 
Wipe, trim, and tie or skewer into shape. If there be a 
large piece of the flank, cut it off, and use it for soups or 
stews. If 3'ou prefer to use it for this purpose after roast- 
ing, draw it round underneath and fasten it with a skewer. 
Lay the meat on a rack in a pan, and dredge all over with 
salt^ pepper^ and flour. Put it in a ver}' hot oven with two 
or three tahlespoonfids of drippings or pieces of the beef fat 
placed in the pan. Place a rack under the pan, or turn the 
heat off from the bottom of the oven. Put the skin side 
down at first, that the heat may harden the juices in the 
lean part. When the flour is brown on the pan and the 
meat is seared, baste with the fat and reduce the heat. 
Baste often, and dredge twice with salt and flour. When 
seared all over, turn and bring the skin side up for the 
final basting and browning. Bake fifty or sixt}^ minutes, 
if liked ver^' rare ; an hour and a quarter to an hour and 
a half, if liked well done. If there be any danger of 
burning the fat in the pan, add a little hot water after 
the flour is browned. Meat may be roasted and carved 
better if placed in the pan and on the platter with the 
skin up instead of the flesh side. 

Carve a sirloin roast by cutting several thin slices parallel 
with the ribs. Then cut down near the backbone and sep- 
arate the slices. Cut out the tenderloin from under the 
bone, and slice it in the same manner. Many turn the 
sirloin over and remove the tenderloin first. Serve a little 
of the crisp -fat on the flank to those who wish it. 



Roast Beef. 221 



Rih Roast. — Remove the backbone aud ribs. Skewer or 
tie into a round shape, and prepare as for sii'loin. Allow 
a longer time for roasting, as the meat is in a more com- 
pact form without the bones. Place it skin side up on the 
platter, and carve thin slices from the flesh side. 

The Back of the Rump, — This is the best and cheapest 
piece for roasting, as the meat is all good and there is not 
as much bone as in other pieces. It is usualh' too large 
for a small familj' ; but in cold weather it may be used to 
advantage, by cutting steaks from the thickest end, using 
the small end for a roast and the bones for soup. 

In carving the rump, when the bone has not been taken 
out, a deep cut should be made at the base, to loosen the 
meat ; then the slices may be cut lengthwise or crosswise. 
When the family is large and all the meat is to be used, 
it is well to cut it lengthwise. Should onl}- a small quan- 
tit}^ be needed, cut only from the small end, and save the 
tougher parts for a stew. Man}' think it more economical 
to serve the poorer parts the fii'st da}*, as thej^ are then 
more palatable, reserving the tender meat to be served 
cold. 

Roast from the Round. — A shce three inches thick, from 
the best part of the top of the round, may be dredged with 
salt^ pejiper, and flour ^ and roasted. Carve in thin slices, 
the same as steak. It is rather tough, but juicy and well 
flavored. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — Beat three eggs verv light. Add 
one scant teaspoonful of salt and one pint of milk. Pour half 
a cup of this mixture on two thirds of a cup of flour, and 
stir to a smooth paste. Add the remainder of the mixture 
and beat well. Bake in hot gem pans fortj'-five minutes. 
Baste with the drippings from the beef. This is a more 
convenient way than to bake in the pan under the beef, 
and gives more crust. Serve as a garnish for roast beef. 

Gravy for Roast Beef. — When the meat is done, put it 
on a plate, and keep it hot while making the gra^y. Hold 
the corner of the dripping-pan over a bowl ; let the liquid 
in the pan settle ; then pour ofl" all the fat and save It 



222 The Boston Cook Book, 

When no water is used in baking and the oven is very hot, 
this liquid will be the fat from the meat. The brown flour 
will settle, and some will adhere to the pan. Pour one pint 
of hot water or stock into the pan, and scrape off all the sedi- 
ment. Pour this water into a saucepan from which it may 
be poured easil}', and place it on the stove to heat. Put 
four tahlespoonfuls of the hot fat into a small fiying-pan, 
and when browned stir in two heapiny tahlespoonfuls of dry 
flour ^ or enough to absorb all the fat. Stir until the flour 
is brown and well mixed ; then add the hot liquid grad- 
ually, and stir as it thickens. Season with salt and pepper^ 
and simmer flve minutes. Strain if not perfectly smooth. 
Gravy can be made in the dripping-pan ; but such pans are 
usually large, inconvenient to handle, and take up more 
space than can be spared on the top of the stove, and are 
much harder to wash when the gravy has been made in 
them. To make it in the pan, pour ofl^ nearl}^ all the fat. 
Put the pan on the stove and add dry flour until the fat is 
all absorbed. Then add hot water or hot stocky and stir as it 
*.hickens. Cook five to eight minutes, and strain. It is well 
for those who like gravies to make a large quantity, as it 
is useful in warming over the remnants of the roast. But 
there is no sauce or made grav}- equal to the natural 
juices contained in the meat, which should flow freely 
into the platter when the meat is carved. 




Fig. 25. Fillet of Beef. 



Fillet of Beef, — Wipe, and remove the fat, veins, and 
tough tendinous portion in the middle. Trim into shape. 
Lard the upper side (see page 25). Dredge with salt,, pep- 
ver, and flour. Put several pieces of pork in the pan under 



Broiled Steak. 223 



the meat. Bake in a hot oven tw^ent}^ or thirty minutes. 
If you prefer, omit the pork and put the choice pieces of 
beef fat over the meat. Serve with mushroom sauce. Or 
brush the fillet with beaten egg^ and sprinkle seasoned and 
buttered crumbs all over it, and bake thirt}' minutes. Or 
stuff the incisions left b}' the removal of the veins and 
tendons with any stuffing or force-meat. Dredge with salt 
and Jlour^ and bake. 

Broiled Steak. 

Wipe, trim off the superfluous fat, and remove the bone. 
Save the flank end for broiled meat cakes. Grease the 
gridiron with some of the fat. Broil over a clear fire, 
turning every ten seconds. Cook three or four minutes, if 
liked rare ; longer, if well done. Serve on a hot platter. 
Season with butter^ salt, and pepper, or serve with Maitrp 
(T Hotel butter. Steaks should be cut at least an inch 
thick. Man}' prefer them much thicker. Sirloin, cross 
cut of the rump, and top of the round are all good steaks. 
The round is juic}', but has a net work of tough white fibre, 
which makes it difficult to masticate. If the steak be very 
tough, pound it with a meat hammer (a hammer with sharp 
teeth for cutting) or cut across it several times with a 
sharp knife on each side. The intense heat will sear the 
surface quickl}-, and prevent the escape of the juices. 

Man}' prefer not to remove the bone in a sirloin steak ; 
but it burns quickl}', and is better for the soup kettle if 
not cooked, and the steak is more easily carved when the 
bone is removed. Carve in narrow slices, giving each 
person a bit of tenderloin, fat, and upper part. 

Broiled Fillet of Beef — Cut slices from the tenderloin. 
Wipe the meat ; grease the gridiron ; broil over a clear 
fire, turnmg every ten counts, for three or five minutes. 
Spread with Maitre d' Hotel butter. 

Broiled Meatp Cakes. — Chop lean, raiv beef quite fine. 
Season with salt, pepper, and a little chopped onion, or onion 
juice. Make it into small flat cakes, and broil on a well- 
gi'eased gridiron or on a hot frying-pan. Serve ver}' hot 



224 ^^ Boston Cook Book, 

with butter or Maitre d^ Hotel sauce. The flank end of the 
sirloin is better when cooked in this manner than when 
broiled with the other part of the steak. 

Hamburgh Steak. — Pound a slice of round steak enough 
to break the fibre. Fry two or three onions^ minced fine, 
in butter until slightly browned. Spread the onions over 
the meat, fold the ends of the meat together, and pound 
again, to keep the onions in the middle. Broil two or 
three minutes. Spread with butter^ salt, and pepper. 

Braised Beef. 

Four to six pounds of beef from the lower part of the 
round or face of the rump. Trim, and rub well with salt, 
pepper, and flour. Cut two small onions into dice, and fry 
them until light brown in salt pork fat or drippings. Skim 
them out into a braising-pan or large granite pan ; then 
brown the meat all over, adding more fat if needed. Put 
the meat into the pan on skewers, to keep it from stick- 
ing, with the onions around, not under, the meat. Add 
one quart of boiling water and one tablespoonfid of mixed 
herbs, which should be tied in a small piece of strainer 
cloth. Cover closely, putting a brick on the cover to keep 
it down, and cook in a moderate oven four hours, basting 
every twenty minutes. Turn over after two hours ; add 
more water as it evaporates, so as to have one pint left for 
gravy. When tender, take up the meat, remove the fat 
and bag of herbs from the gravy ; add more salt and pep- 
per, and if desired add lemon juice, tomato, or mushrooms; 
thicken with two tablespoonfuls of flour, wet in a little cold 
water. Cook ten minutes, and pour the gravy over the 
meat. Garnish with potato balls, boiled onions, or with veg- 
etables d, la Jardiniere. Horseradish sauce maj" be served 
with the meat. This is a very nutritious, palatable, and 
convenient way of cooking the cheaper parts of beef, a 
cusii. n of veal, tongues, fowls, liver, and some other kinds 
of meat. The meat is equall}- good cold or hot ; there is 
no ^aste if care be taken not to let it become hard and dry 



Beef Steiv, 225 



by being exposed to the air. This method of cooking 
commends itself especiall^^ to those who " are tired of 
roasted, boiled, or fried meat.'* 

Beef a la Mode. 

Four to six pounds from the under part of the round of 
heef^ cut thick. Wipe, and trim off the rough edges. Put 
it in a deep earthen dish, and pour over it spiced vine- 
gar, made by boiling for five minutes one cup of vinegar^ 
one onion, chopped fine , three teaspoonfids of salt^ and half a 
teaspoonfid each of mustard, pepper, cloves, and allspice. 
Let the meat stand several hours, turning it often. Then 
daub it with ten or twelve strips of salt pork, cut one third of 
tt7i inch wide, and as long as the meat is thick, inserting 
them with a lardiug-needle or carving-steel. Or make 
large incisions and stuff with bread crumbs, highly seasoned 
with salt, pepper, onions, thyme, marjoram, etc., moistened 
with hot water, one tablespoonful of butter, and one well-beaten 
^gg. Tie it into good shape with a narrow strip of cotton 
cloth, to keep in the stuffing. Dredge with flour. Cut 
two onions, half a carrot, and hcdf a turnip fine, and fry 
them in fat or drippings until brown. Put them in the 
stewpan. Then brown the meat all over in the fat ; put 
it on a trivet in the pan, and half cover with boiling water. 
Add one tablespoonful of mixed herbs, tied in a small 
strainer cloth. Cover closel}^ and simmer four hours, or 
until tender. Take it up carefuUj', remove the strings, and 
put it on a large platter. Remove the fat from the gravy, 
add more seasoning, and thicken with flour wet in a little 
cold water ; boil eight minutes, and strain it over the meat. 
Garnish ^\\h potato balls and small onions. 

Beef Stevp- with Dumplings. 

The aitch bone is the nicest piece for a beef stew. There 
is some ver}^ ji^ic}' meat on the upper side in the large 
muscle which lies next to the top of the round, and it will 
serve a small family for a roast, and then may be made 

15 



226 The Boston Cook Book, 

into a stew. The flavor obtained by roasting adds mucti 
to the stew ; for tliis reason, wlien the meat has not been 
cooked, brown it in a little fat before stewing. The bones 
should never be chopped and splintered, but sawed care- 
fulh% and all the fine, crumbly pieces removed before 
cooking. Other good pieces for stews are two or three 
pounds from the middle cut of the shin^ or the flank end of 
a large sirloin roast, or the upper part of the chuck rib. 
Any part that has bone and fat, as well as lean, either 
cooked or uncooked, makes the best-flavored stew. The 
fat and bones may be removed before serving, and such 
pieces are much better than dr}^ lean meat. Remove the 
meat from the bones, and put them with part of the fat 
into the stewpan. Cut the meat into small pieces, and if not 
previoush^ cooked, dredge with salt^ pepper^ siud flour, and 
brown all over in salt pork fat or drippings. Put it into 
the stewpan. Cut two onions, one small white turnip, and 
half a small carrot (if 3'ou like the flavor) into half-inch 
dice. Cook them slightlj" in the dripping, and add them 
to the stew. Add boiling water enough to cover, and sim* 
mer two or three hours, or till the meat is tender. Remove 
the bones, and skim oflT the fat. While the meat is cook- 
ing pare six or eight small potatoes, and soak them in cold 
water. Wh^n the meat is tender, pour boiling water over 
them, and boil five minutes to take out the acrid taste. 
Drain, and add them to the stew. Add salt and pepper to 
taste. When dumplings are to be served with the stew, 
add them when the potatoes are nearl}^ done. The liquor 
should come up just even with the potatoes, that the dump- 
plings may rest on them. Cover closely to keep in the 
steam, and cook ten minutes without lifting the cover. 
Take out the dumplings, put the meat and potatoes in 
the centre of a hot platter, and the dumplings round the 
edge. 

Remove the fat, and add more salt and pepper, if needed, 
to the broth ; and if not thick' enough, add a little flour 
wet smooth in cold ivater, and boil five minutes. Add one 
CUV of strained tomato and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley 



Pot Roast. 227 



Pour the gravy over the meat, putting part of it in a 
sauce tureen if there be more than the platter will hold. 

Dumplings. — One pint of flour ^ half a teaspoonful of 
salt^ one teaspoonful of cream of tartar^ and half a tea- 
spoonful of soda (or three level teaspoonfuls of baking- 
poivder). Mix with one scant cup of siveet milk into a 
dough soft enough to handle easily. Pat it out half an 
inch thick. Cut in small rounds, or mix softer and drop 
by the spoonful into the boiling stew. Cook ten minutes. 

Rolled Flank of Beef. 

Four or Jive pounds of the flank. Wipe, and remove the 
skin, membrane, and extra fat. Pound and tpm until of 
uniform thickness. Make a stuffing with one cup of cracker 
crumbs^ two tahlespoonfuls of fine chopped salt pork ^ half a 
teaspoonful of salt^ one saltspoonful each of thyme^ marjoram^ 
and sage^ half a saltspoonful of pepper^ a few drops of onion 
juice ^ or 07ie teaspoonful of chopped onion ^ and one egg. 
Moisten with hot water until soft enough to spread over the 
meat. Roll over, and tie or sew securel}^ Wrap a cloth 
around it. Put it into boiling water, and simmer six 
hours or until tender. Remove the cloth, press it, and 
when cold remove the strings. Serve cold, cut in thin 
slices. Corned flank ma}* be prepared in the same way. 
The stuffing may be omitted, and the meat covered with 
vinegar spiced and flavored with onion, and after remain- 
ing in the pickle several hours, rolled, and boiled as above. 

Smothered Beef, or Pot Roast. 

Four to six pounds from the middle oy face of the rump^ 
the vein., or the round. Wipe with a clean wet cloth. 
Sear all over b}' placing in a hot ftying-pan and turning 
till all the surface is browned. Put in a kettle with one 
cup of ivater^ and place it where it will keep just below the 
boiling-point. Do not let the water boil entirely away, 
but add only enough to keep the meat from burning 



228 The Boston Cook Book. 

Have the cover fitting closely to keep in the steam. Cook 
until ver}' tender, but do not let it break. Serve hot oi' 
cold. The meat when cold is delicious, cut in quarter- 
inch slices, and sauted in hot butter. 

Spiced Beef. 

Four to six pounds from the middle cut of the shin. Wash 
the meat on the outside, and cut off an}' part of the skin 
which is not sweet and clean. Pick off all the fine frag- 
ments of bone. Cut the meat into several pieces ; cover 
with boiling water. Skim carefully as it boils, and then 
simmer until the meat falls to pieces, and the liquor is 
reduced to half a pint. Remove the meat ; season the 
liquor highly with salt^ pepper^ sage^ and thyme. Add it 
to the meat, and mix with a fork till the meat is all 
broken. Pack in a brickloaf pan. When cold, cut in 
thin slices. 

Corned Beef. 

Select a piece of beef which has a fair proportion of fat, — - 
the brisket or second cut of rattle rand. If ver}' salt, soak 
in cold water half an hour. Put on to boil in fresh cold 
water, enough to cover it. If not very salt, wash it and 
use boiling water, but never let it boil fast. Skim care- 
fully when it begins to boil, and cook slowly, simmering 
(not boiling) until so tender that you can pick it to 
pieces with a fork. Let the water boil away toward the 
last, and let the beef stand in the water until partially 
cooled. Lift it out of the water with a skimmer, and 
pack it in a brickloaf pan; let the long fibres run the 
length of the pan ; mix in the fat so tliat it will be well 
marbled. Put a thin board, a trifle smaller than the in- 
side of the pan, over the meat, and press by putting a 
heavy weight on the board. When cold, cut in thin slices. 
This is the most appetizing way of serving the fat of the 
meat, which in corned beef is a desirable part and is often 
untouched if offered in a mass on the edge of the lean. 



Boiled Dinner. 229 



An Old-fashioned Boiled Dinner. {Mrs. Poor.} 

Notwithstanding that this dish has fallen into ill-repute 
with many people, it may be prepared so as to be both pal- 
atable and nutritious for those who exercise freel3\ It is 
more suitable for cold seasons. The most healthful and 
economical wa}', though perhaps not the old-fashioned way, 
is to boil the beef the da}' before. 

Four pounds of cortied beef , two or fh?^ee beets, a small cab- 
bage, two small carrots, one small white French turnip, six or 
^^ght potatoes of uniform size, and one small crooked-neck 
xquash. 

Wash and soak the corned beef in cold water, and put it 
on to boil in fresh cold water ; skim, and simmer until ten- 
der, but not long enough for it to fall to pieces. Let it 
cool in the liquor in which it was boiled. Put it into a 
flat shallow dish, cover it with a board, and press it. 
Remove all the fat from the meat liquor, and save \t to 
clarif}' for shortening. Save the meat liquor, but do not 
let it stand in an iron kettle or tin pan. Boil the beets 
the da}^ before, also, and cover them with vinegar. The 
next da}' prepare the vegetables. Wash them all, scrape 
the carrots, and cut the cabbage into quarters ; pare the 
turnip and squash, and cut into three-quarter-inch slices, 
and pare the potatoes. Put the meat liquor on to boil 
about two hours befoi^e dinner time ; when boihng, put in 
the carrots, afterward the cabbage and turnip, and half an 
hour before dinner add the squash and potatoes. When 
tender, take the vegetables up carefully ; drain the water 
from the cabbage by pressing it in a colander. Slice the 
carrots. Put the cold meat in the centre of a large dish, 
and serve the carrots, turnips, and potatoes round the edge, 
with the squash, cabbage, and pickled beets in separate 
dishes ; or serve each vegetable in a dish by itself. This 
may all be done the same day if the meat be put on to 
boil very early, removed as soon as tender, the fat taken 
off, and the vegetables added to the boiling meat liquor, 
beginning with those which require the longest time to 



230 The Boston Cook Book, 

cook. This will depend very much upon their freshness. 
But whichever way the dish is prepared, boil the beets 
alone, remove the meat and fat before adding the vege- 
tables, and serve each as whole and daintily as possible. 
The next morning use what remains of the vegetables as a 
vegetable hash. 

Vegetable Hash. — Equal parts of cabbage^ beets, and tur- 
nips, and as much potato as there is of all the other vege- 
tables. Chop all ver}^ fine ; add a little salt and pepjyer ; 
put a spoo7iful of drippings in the frjing-pan, and when 
hot add the hash, and cook slowly until vrarmed through. 

Tongue in Jelly. 

Wash a fresh tongue, and skewer the tip to the root. 
Cook until tender in boihng salted water ; remove the skin ; 
trim and tie it in good shape. Season two quarts of soup 
stock highl}^ with salt, pepper, herbs, and wine or lemon. 
Clear it with eggs, and stiffen with the proportion of Cox's 
gelatine, as given for Aspic Jelly. Pour a little jelly into 
a mould ; when cool, la3' in the cold tongue, and add the 
remainder of the jelly slowlj'. 

Smoked Tongue. — Smoked tongues are much more pala- 
table, though not so economical as when fresh. Bend the 
tip of the tongue around, and tie it to the root. Put it in 
cold water and place over the fire. When the water boils, 
pour off the water, and put it on again in cold water. 
Boil until tender, or about two hours. Remove the skin, 
roots, and fat. Pour a white sauce over the tongue, and 
serve it hot ; or serve it cold with a salnd dressing. 
Tongues may also be braised (see Braised Beef, page 224) 
and served hot or cold. 

Lyonnaise Tripe. 

Tripe should always be boiled twenty to thirty minutes 
before cooking, or it will be tough. 

Cut the tripe in small pieces ; boil twenty-five minutes, 
and drain. Fry ojie tablespoonful of chopped onion in one 



Liver. 231 

heaping tablespoonfid of hatter till 3'ellow. Add the tripe, 
one tablespoonfid of vinegar^ and one tahlespoonful of chopped 
parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Simmer five minutes, 
and serve plain or on toast. 

Broiled Tripe. — Boil the tripe twenty minutes; dry it, 
spread with soft butter, salt, and pepper, and broil until 
brown. 

Ty-ipe in Batter. — Boil the tripe twent}' minutes. Cut 
in pieces two inches square, dip in batter, and fry in salt 
pork fat in a liying-pan. 

Batter. — One egg, one quarter of a cup of water, one 
tahlespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonfid of salt, and flour to 
make almost a drop batter. 

Liver. 

Soak ten minutes in boiling water to draw out the 
blood. Drain ; remove the thin skin and veins. Cut 
into pieces for serving. Season with salt and pepper; 
roll in flour, and fty in salt pork or bacon fat. Drain, and 
serve with a brown gravy, seasoned with onion, lemon 
juice, or vinegar. Or spread with butter, and broil, and 
season with salt, pepper, and butter. 

Kidneys. 

Beef and sheep's kidne3's are often recommended for 
food on account of their cheapness. Epicures are fond 
of them. The taste for them is an acquired taste, which 
it is not desirable to cultivate. The latest decision of 
ph3'sicians is that they are not suitable to eat ; as "from 
their constant use in the animal system as excretorj^ or- 
gans, — organs which separate from the blood that which, 
if it remained in the blood, would poison the system, — 
they are often hable to become diseased." 



232 The Boston Cook Boole. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 

Mutton stands next to beef in nutritive qualities, and 
with many has even more vakie as food, because more 
easily digested. In mutton about one half the weight is 
in fat, while with beef it is only one third. 

The choicest mutton comes from the mountainous re- 
gions of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carohna. 
Good mutton should be large and heavy, the fat clear 
white and very hard, the flesh fine-grained and bright 
red. Poor mutton has but little fat, and little flesh as 
compared with the bone. 

Mutton is cut at the market by splitting down the back, 
and dividing at the loin into the hind and fore quarters ; 
or the hind and fore quarters are separated without split- 
ting, and the loin is taken out whole and sold as the sad- 
dle of mutton. The leg, loin, and saddle are best for 
roasting, and are better if kept for some time before cook- 
ing. The leg, if to be boiled, should be fresh. The fore 
quarter is good boned and stuffed ; then steamed, and 
browned in the oven. The neck and bones are used for 
broths and stews. Chops are cut from the ribs and from 
the loin. The rib chops are sometimes cut long, with the 
flank on. The bone is removed and the meat rolled. 
These roll chops are not economical, as the flank forms the 
greater part. French chops are cut short from the rib, 
and the flesh is scraped clean from the end of the bone. 
The best-flavored, most tender, and cheapest in the end, 
are the chops from the loin. The}' have \Qvy little bone, 
and a piece of tenderloin. 

Mutton has a strong flavor, disagreeable to man3\ It 
is said to be caused by the oil from the wool, which pen- 
etrates the skin. The pink skin above the fot should 
always be removed from chops, and wherever it is pos- 



Leg of Mutton. 233 



sible, scrape it off without cutting into the lean. The 
caul, or lining membrane of the abdomen, is fastened 
round the meat, particularly on the leg, partly to increase 
its weight. This is often left on in roasting to help baste 
the meat ; but it gives a strong flavor, and should alwaj's 
be removed, and the kidney fat used if needed. If care 
be taken in selecting only the best mutton, and in cook- 
ing it in the best manner, man}^ who have become preju- 
diced against it could eat it with as much relish as beef. 
Mutton may be cooked rare, but lamb should alwaj's be 
well cooked. The end of the bone in a leg of mutton is 
smooth and oval, and is separated at the joint; while 
lamb may be known from mutton by the flat, irregularly 
grooved end of the bone, which is broken off squarel}^, 
instead of separated at the joint. Sometimes the bone 
is cut off close to the second joint, and then you will have 
to depend upon the word of your butcher. 

Saddle or Loin of Mutton or Lamb. 

Trim off all the pink skin and superfluous fat. Remove 
the ends of the ribs, the cord, and veins along the back. 
Wipe, and rub the inside with salt. Roll the flank under 
on each side, and sew it across the middle. Dredge with 
salt^ pepper^ and Jlour ; place it in the pan, with the inside 
up, in order to thoroughly cook the fat. Baste, and 
dredge often. When the fat is brown and crisp, turn, 
and cook the upper part till brown. Keep a buttered 
paper over it to prevent burning. 

CaiTC long slices parallel with the backbone, then slip 
the knife under and separate the slices from the ribs. 
Divide the slices, and serve with some of the crisp fat. 

A loin of mutton may be staffed and rolled, having first 
removed the ends of the ribs. Bake, and serve in slices 
cut at right angles 'with the backbone. 

Leg of Mutton, Stuffed and Roasted. 

Remove the bone ; wipe inside and out with a wet cloth ; 
sprinkle the inside with salt ; stuff and sew. Put it on a 



Z34 Th^ Boston Cook Booh, 

rack in a dripping-pan, with some of the kidney suet on 
the meat and in the pan. Dredge with salt^ pepper^ and 
flour ^ and bake in a hot oven. Baste as soon as the flour 
is brown, and baste often. Bake one hour, if liked rare ; 
one hour and a quarter, if well done. 

Stuffing. — One cup of cracker or stale bread crumbs. 
Season with one saltspoonful each of salt, pepper, thyme, or 
marjoram, and moisten with a quarter of a cup of melted 
butter. Add Jiot ivater if a moist stuffing be desired. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton or Lamb. — Wipe, remove the fat, 
and put into well-salted boiling water. Skim, and simmer 
twelve minutes for each pound of meat. One quarter of a 
cup of rice is sometimes boiled with the mutton, or the 
meat maj^ be tied in a cloth to keep it from becoming 
discolored. SerA^e with a thick caper sauce poured over the 
mutton. Garnish with parsley. Serve with currant jellj". 

Carve slices from the thickest part of the leg down to 
the bone ; then slip the knife under and remove the slices 
from the bone. The thickest part of the leg should be 
toward the back of the platter. 

What to do with a Fore Quarter of Mutton. 

Mutton Duck. — Select a fore quarter of mutton with 
the whole length of the leg bone left on. Ask the butcher 
to cut off what is called a raised shoulder, that is, raised 
from the backbone and ribs, cutting it far up on the 
shoulder to take in the whole of the shoulder blade, bone, 
and gristle. You may cut it yourself by removing the 
neck, the back bones, the ribs, and breast bones, leaving 
the shoulder blade in the upper part. Then scrape the 
flesh from the shoulder blade, and separate the blade at 
the joint. Lay it aside for further use. Remove the meat 
from the leg bone, turning the meat over, as j'ou would 
turn a glove over your hand. Be careful not to cut 
through the thin skin at the end of the leg. When within 
three inches of the lower joint, saw the bone off, and saw 
or trim the bone below the joint into the shape of a duck's 
bill. Bend the joint without breaking the skin. Wipe the 



Mutton Duck, 235 



meat and rub inside with salt. Make a moist stuffing and 
put it in between the hi^'ers of meat. With a coarse needle 
threaded with twine gather the edges of the meat, draw 
them together, fill the cavit}' with stuffing, and shape the 
meat into a long oval form like the body of a duck. Bend 
the leg at the lower joint to represent the duck's head and 
neck, and keep it in place with skewers. Run one skewer 




Fig. 26. Mutton Duck. 

through the side at the top of the body, and put one into the 
bod}^ on each side of the neck. Wind a string around the 
bill, and fasten it to the skewers. Scrape the shoulder blade 
clean, trim the bon}^ end into a sharp point, and notch the 
gristle at the opposite end. Insert this in the bod}^ to 
represent the tail, and fasten with twine. Put the bones 
and scraps of meat in water in a steamer or kettle. Place 
the duck on a plate, and steam it over the bones one hour 
to make it tender. Dredge with salt, pepper^ and flour^ 
and bake one hour, or till brown ; use the water in the 
kettle for basting if needed, or for a gra^y. Tie paper 
over the head and tail to prevent burning. This ma}' be 
made of lamb, and if tender will require no steaming. 
Garnish with parsley and Scotch eggs^ or with any kind of 
force-meat balls, crumbed and fried, or with egg-shaped 
potato croquettes. 

This Mock Duck is an attractive way of serving what is 
usuall}' considered an inferior piece of meat, and solves the 
vexing problem, " how to carve a fore quarter of mutton." 



236 The Boston Cook Book. 

The bones may be entirel}' removed, and the meat 
stuffed, and sewed in an oval shape, then steamed and 
browned ; this will prove just as palatable to those who do 
not crave something new. In serving, cut it across in 
medium slices. 

Braised Mutton. — Bone and stuff" the leg or the fore 
quarter, as directed in the preceding receipts ; cut the bone 
at the joints. Add 03'sters to the stuffing if preferred, 
and cook the same as braised beef. The breast of mut- 
ton ma3^ be boned and rolled without stuffing and then 
braised. 

Lamh or Mutton Chops. — Wipe with a wet cloth; re- 
move the skin and extra fat ; have a ftying-pan hissing 
hot, without an}^ fat ; put in the chops and cook one 
minute, turn, and sear the other side ; cook more slowl}' 
until done, five minutes if liked rare. Stand them up 
on the fat edge to brown the fat, without over-cooking 
the meat. When nearly done, sprinkle a little salt on each 
side. Drain on paper, and serve hot, either plain or with 
tomato or Soubise sauce. 

Mutton Cutlets^ Breaded. — Trim the cutlets, and season 
with salt and pep-per. Dip in crumbs^ beaten egg., and crumbs 
again, and fry in smohing hot fat^ four to six 
minutes if rare, eight to ten if well done. Ar- 
range in the centre of a hot dish, and pour tomato 
sauce around them, or place them around a mound 
of mashed potatoes or spinach. Trim the bones 
with a paper ruffle; or arrange them with the 
bone end up, stacked like baj'onets, and gar- 
nish with stuffed tomatoes.

one tablespoonful of butter., cooked together and flavored 
with mushrooms., parsleg. and le7non juice. Lay the cutlets

edges, place in a pan in the oven for ten minutes. Serve 
in the papers. If the chops be tough, dip them in olive oil 
before broiling. 

Fricassee of Glut- 
ton or Lamb with 
Peas. — Cut two 
founds oithQ breast 
of mutton or lamb 
into square pieces. 
Dredge with salt 
and flour., and 
brown in butter 
or drippings. Put 
them in a stew- 
pan with one onion 
sliced, cover with 
boiling water, and. 
simmer until the 
bones slip out. Remove the bones, strain the liquor, skim 
off the fat, and when the liquor boils again, add the meat, 
salt, and pepper, and stew until 
nearly' tender ; then add one quart 
of peas, or one pint of boiled mac- 
aroni cut into half -inch pieces, or 
one pint of asparagus tips, and sim- 
mer fifteen minutes. 

Mutton Steivfor Two. — Tivo mut- 
ton chops, cut from near the shoul- 
der. Put them in a shallow pan 
having a tight cover. Pour on 
boiling water to the depth of one 
inch ; cover and simmer one hour ; 
add more water as it boils awa}', 
using onh' enough to keep the 
meat from burning. Add two 
slices of French turnip, two small 
onions whole ; and when the meat and turnip are nearly 
tender, add two common-sized potatoes, having first soaked 




Fig. 29. Chop in Paper.

and scalded them. Add one teaspoonful of salt and a little 
pepper. Remove the vegetables without breaking ; let the 
water boil nearly away, leaving enough for a gravy. Re- 
move the fat, thicken the gravy with fiour, and if needed 
add salt and tomato catchup. Pour it over the meat. ^ 

Curry of Mutton. — Fry one large onion, cut fine, in 07ie 
heaping tablespoonful of butter. Mix one tahlespoonful of 
curry powder, one teaspoonful of salt, one tahlespoonful of 
flour, and stir it into the butter and onion. Add gradu- 
ally one pint of hot water or stock. Cut two pounds of lean 
mutton into small pieces, and brown them in hot fat ; add 
them to the sauce, and simmer until tender. Place the 
meat on a hot dish, and arrange a border of boiled rice 
or Turkish pilaf around the meat. Slices of cold cooked 
mutton may be used instead of the fresh meat. Veal 
curry is prepared in the same manner. 

Ragout of Mutton, made from the fore quarter, or any 
cooked mutton, may be prepared as directed for beef 
stew, adding carrots and turnips cut small, and seasoning 
highly. 

Sheep's Tongues, Braised. 

Wash, dredge with salt smdfloitr, and brown in salt pork 
fat, with one or two minced onions. Put them in a pan 
with water or stock to half cover ; add one sprig of parsley, 
a little salt and pepper ; cover and cook two hours, or until 
tender. Remove the skin, and trim neatl}^ at the roots. 
Place a mound of spinach in the centre of the dish ; ar- 
range the tongues around the spinach, alternating with 
diamonds of fried bread. 

Lambs' Tongues, Boiled. — Boil six tongues in salted 
water, with the juice of half a lemon, until tender. Serve 
cold with Tartar sauce. Or pickle them by covering with 
hot spiced vinegar. 



VeaL • 239 



VEAL. 

Veal is always in the market, but is better in the 
spring. The fat should be white and clear ; and the lean, 
pink or flesh color. If the flesh be white, the calf has 
been bled before being killed, and the meat is unfit to eat. 
Veal contains less nitrogen, but more gelatine, than beef. 
It has very little flavor, and needs to be highly seasoned 
to make it even palatable. Veal stands lowest among 
heat-producing meats, and should be eaten with potatoes 
or rice, which stand highest, or with bacon and jellj-, which 
furnish in their fat and sugar the carbon wanting in the 
flesh. It should always be thoroughly cooked, as under- 
done veal is not wholesome. At its lowest price veal is 
never a cheap food when we take into consideration the 
small amount of nutriment it contains, the large amount of 
fuel required to cook it, and the danger of being made ill 
by its use. 

The lower part of the leg or knuckle and all the gristly 
portions are used for soups. Cutlets, or steaks, the fillet, 
fricandeau, or cushion, are cut from the thickest part of 
the leg. The loin is used for chops or roasts, the breast 
for roasts, and the neck for stews and soups. Calf s head 
and pluck includes the lights, heart, and liver. The head 
is used for soup, the heart and liver for braising. The 
lights are now seldom used. 

Roast Veal. 

The loin, breast, and fillet (a thick piece from the upper 
part of the leg) are the best pieces for roasting. The 
bone should be removed from the fillet, and the cavity 
filled with a highly seasoned and very 7noist stiiffitig. Tie 
or skewer into a round shape. Dredge with salt, peppet, 



240 • The Boston Cook Book. 

and Jlour. Put strips of po7^k over the top, and bake. 
Allow half an hour to a p^und. Cover with a buttered 
paper to keep the meat from burning. Add water, when 
the flour has browned, and baste often. Serve with horse- 
radish or tomato sauce. 

Fricandeau of Veal. — This is made of a thick piece of 
lean meat from the top of the leg. Trim it off high in the 
centre and thin on the edges, and lard the top. Braise it 
in stock highly seasoned with bacon., onions., and herbs (see 
Braised Beef) . Serve it with tomato or horseradish sauce. 

Veal Stew or Fricassee. 

The ends of the ribs^ the neck., and the knuckle may be 
utilized in a stew. Cut the meat — two pounds — in small 
pieces, and remove all the fine bones. Cover the meat 
with boiling water ; skim as it begins to boil ; add two small 
onions., two teaspoonfids of salt., and one saltspoonfal of pep- 
per. Simmer until thoroughl}' tender. Cut four potatoes 
in halves ; soak in cold water, and parboil them five min- 
utes ; add them to the stew. Add one tablespoonful of 
flour wet in cold water, and more seasoning if desired ; 
and just before serving add one cup of cream ^ or if milk be 
used add one tablespoonful of butter. Remove the bones 
before serving. To make Veal Pot-Pie add dumplings., as 
in Beef Stew. If intended for a fricassee^ fty the veal in 
salt pork fat before stewing, and omit the potatoes. Add 
one egg to the liquor just before serving, if 3'ou wish it 
richer. 

Veal Cutlets. {Joanna Sweeny.) 

One slice of veal from the leg. Wipe, and remove the 
bone, skin, and tough membranes. Pound and cut, or shape 
into pieces for serving. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Roll in fine crumbs., then dip in beaten egg., then in crumbs 
again. Fr}'' several slices of salt pork., and fry the cutlets 
brown in the pork fat. When brown, put the cutlets in a 
stewpan. Make a brown gravy with one tablespoonful of 
butter.^ or the fat remaining in the pan if it be not 



Calf^s Liver. 241 



burned, and two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour. Pour 
on gradually a cup and a half^ of stock or ivater. Season 
with Woi-cester shire sauce or lemon or horseradish or tomato. 
Pour the gravy over the cutlets, and simmer forty-five min- 
utes or till tender. Take them out on a platter, remove 
the fat from the gravy, add more seasoning if needed, and 
strain over the cutlets. Garnish with lemon and parsley. 

Calfs Liver, Braised. 

Wipe with a clean wet cloth. Lard the rounded side 
with bacon or salt pork. Fry one onion in salt pork fat. 
Put the liver and fried onion in a braising-pan ; add hot 
water or stock to half cover, oyie teaspoonfid of salt^ one salt- 
spoonful of pepper, and one tablespoonfid of herbs. Cover, 
and cook in a moderate oven two hours, basting often. 
When read}' to serve, strain the liquor, season with lemon 
juice, and pour it over the liver. 

Calf's Heart, Braised. — Wash, remove the veins and 
arteries, and stuff with cracker crumbs, seasoned with onion 
auice, salt, pepper, and herbs, and moistened with butter. 




Fig. 30. Calfs Heart. 

Lard with bacon or salt pork. Dredge with salt and flour. 
Fry one onion in salt pork fat or dripping ; brown the meat 
in the pork fat. Cook it as hver is cooked, by the preced- 
ing receipt. 

Calf's Head. 

Scrape and clean a calfs head. Take out the brains and 
tongue, and put them in cold water. Remove all the dark 
membrane from the inside, and the gristle around the nose 

16 



242 The Boston Cook Book. 

and eyes. Soak two hours in lukewarm water to whiten 
it. Put the head, tongue, and heart on to boil in cold 
water, and skim carefully'. Add one tahlespoonfal of herhs 
tied in a piece of strainer cloth, one tablespoonful of salt^ 
and o?ie saltspoonful of pepper. Pour hoiling water over the 
liver, let it stand ten minutes, and when the head is nearly 
done, add the liver. When done, take up the head ; re- 
move the skin in as nice pieces as possible. Put the 
pieces of head meat on the platter ; la}' the skin over them. 
Cut the heart, tongue, and liver in slices, and place them 
round the edge of the dish. If the head is to be served 
with the bones, tie it in a floured cloth, and boil it until 
tender, but not long enough for the skin to fall off. Serve 
it plain ; or score the top, brush with beaten egg^ sprinkle 
buttered cracker crumbs over it, and brown in the oven. 
Serve with it a brown sauce piquante^ tomato sauce^ or 
brain sauce. 

Brain Sauce. — Clean the brains, remove the red mem- 
brane, and soak in cold water. Put them into one pint of 
cold water with one tablespoonful of lemon juice and half a 
teaspoonful of salt. Boil ten minutes ; then plunge into 
cold water. Make one pint of drawn butter sauce; flavor 
with lemon and parsley ; add the brains chopped fine, and 
when hot serve. 

Calf's Head^ Minced. — Chop what is left of the head., 
tongue., and liver very fine, and warm it in a sauce made 
with the meat liquor ; season with lemon or horseradish., salt, 
and pepper. 

Sweetbreads. 

The sweetbreads found in veal are considered the best. 
They are two large glands lying along the back of the 
throat and in the breast. The lower one is round and 
compact, and called the heart sweetbread, because nearer 
the heart. The upper, or throat, sweetbread is long and 
narrow, and easily divided into sections. The connecting 
membrane is sometimes broken, and each gland sold as a 
whole sweetbread. But there should always be two. Sweet- 



Sweetbreads. 



243 



breads were formerly thrown awa}* as worthless ; but the 
demand for them has increased so that now they are a lux- 
ury. They have a delicate flavor, and as the}' spoil 
quickly, should be put into cold water as soon as pur- 
chased, and parboiled before using in an}' form, to insure 
their being thoroughl}' cooked. They are sometimes left 
on the breast of veal, and may then be roasted with the 
meat. 

To Prepare Siveethreads. — Put them in cold water; re- 
move the pipes and membranes. Cook them in boiling 
salted water, with one tahlespoonful of lemon juice, twent}- 
minutes, and plunge into cold water to harden. The}' may 
then be cooked in either of the following ways : — 

Larded. — Lard, and bake until brown, basting with 
brown stock. Serve with peas. 

Fried. — Roll in Jine bread crumbs ., egg^ and a second 
time in crumbs, and fry in deep fat, or saute in a little fat. 

No. 2. — Cut in 
half-inch slices, roll 
in seasoned crumbs, 
egg, and crumbs again. 
Put three slices on a 
small skewer, alter- 
nating with three thin 
slices of bacon one 
inch square. Fry in 
deep fat. Serve on the skewers, with tomato scmce. 

Creamed. — Cut in small pieces, and serve in a white 
sauce, on toast or in toast patties or in puff-paste shells or 
as a vol-au-vent. 

Broiled. — Rub with butter, salt, and pepper ; wrap in 
buttered paper, and broil ten minutes. Serve with llaitre 
d! Hotel butter. 

Sccdloped or in Cases. — Cut or break the sweetbreads 
into small sections. Mix with a rich cream sauce made 
with eggs (see page 190). Put them in a scallop dish, in 
shells, or iu paper cases. Cover with buttered crumbs, and 
bake until the crumbs are brown. 




Fig. 31. Sweetbreads and Bacon. 



244 



The Boston Cook Book, 



With Mushrooms. — Prepare as for creamed or scalloped^ 
and add half or an equal amount of mushrooms^ chopped 
or cut into quarters. Garnish with toast points. 

Braised. — Lard with hacon. Put in a covered pan 
with fried onions^ and parsley^ and a pinch of herhs^ tied 
in a cloth. Half cover with stock. Bake forty or fifty 
minutes. 

Fritters. — Break into sections, and mix with a fritter 
batter (page 106). Fry by small spoonfuls in deep fat. 

Sweetbread Croquettes^ see Index. 

To serve sweetbreads, either larded, broiled, or fried, 
arrange around a centre of tomato sauce, mushrooms, or 




Fig. 32. Sweetbreads on Macaroni 



peas. Or put the sweetbreads in the centre on a nest 
of boiled macaroni. Sprinkle the macaroni with cheese, 
and pour white sauce or tomato sauce over it ; or garnish 
the sv/eetbreads with stuffed tomatoes. 

Gcmiish for Fried or Larded Sweetbreads. — Cut into 
strips the size of matches, part of the breast of a roasted 
or boiled chicken., some cold boiled ham and cooked 
spaghetti^ about a cup of each. Keep them hot in a 
steamer until the sauce is ready. Stew half a can of 
tomato until soft. Rub all but the seeds through a 
puree strainer. Heat again and boil down till quite thick 
and reduced to one cup. Season with one tahlespoonful 
of butter^ half a teaspoonful of salt^ a bit of cayenne, and 
one tablespoonfal of lemon juice. Add one tablesjwonful 
of glaze if you have it. When the sweetbreads are ready, 
arrange the mixture of ham, spaghetti, and chicken on a 
hot platter ; pour the tomato over it and lay the sweet- 
breads on the top. 



Porh. 245 



PORK. 

Pork is an unwholesome meat, and should never be 
eaten by children, or people with weak digestion, nor, 
indeed, by any one except in cold weather. Salt pork, 
bacon, and ham are less objectionable than fresh pork. 
If fresh pork be desired, obtain it, if possible, from a 
source where 3'ou can be sure the animal has been kept 
in a cleanly manner and fattened on corn. Fresh pork 
should be 3'oung and firm, the fat white, the lean a pale 
red, and the skin white and clear. The fat, when salted, 
should be a delicate pink, and the rind should be thin. 
Soft, flabbj^ flesh, and 3^ellowish fat with kernels, indicate 
that the pork is not of the best qualit\\ UnUke other 
meat, pork is divided into fat and lean. The flank and 
the thick la3'er of fat above the flesh are salted. The 
sides of very 3'Oung pigs are smoked, as well as sailed, and 
are called bacon. The hams and shoulders are salted 
and smoked. The head and feet are pickled or boiled, 
and made into souse or head cheese. After the fat is 
removed, the loin and ribs are used for roasting or for 
chops. The leaf fat from the kidneys is heated until 
melted, then strained, cooled, and used as lard. The 
trimmings of lean and fat, when chopped and highly 
seasoned, are called sausage meat. 

Roast Pig. 

Select a pig from three to five weeks old. Clean well, 
and stuff with hot mashed potatoes, or stale bread, highly 
seasoned with sage, salt, pepper, and onions. If bread be 
used, moisten with warm loater, melted butter, and one beaten 
egg. Stuff and sew. Skewer the fore legs forward, and 



246 The Boston Cook Booh 

the hiud legs backward. Rub all over with butter^ salt, 
pepper, and flour. Put it into a pan with a little water ; 
the oven should not be very hot at first, as it should be 
thoroughl}^ warmed through before browning. Baste verj' 
often, and at first use melted butter to make the skin tender 
and soft. Be careful not to let it burn. Bake two and a 
half or three hours. Arrange in a bed of parsley and 
celery leaves, with a " tuft of cauliflower in the mouth and a 
garland of parsley round the neck." Serve with apple sauce 
or pickles. In carving, cut off the head, then the hams 
and shoulders ; split down the back, and separate the 
ribs. 

Eoast Fork. — The chine, or loin, and the spare ribs are 
the best pieces for roasting. Rub well with pepper, or sage, 
salt, and Jlou?', and bake twenty minutes for each pound. 
Baste often, and do not have the oven as hot as for 
other meat. Roast pork is more wholesome when eaten 
cold. 

Po7'k Chops or Steaks. — If pork chops are to be broiled, 
the}^ should be cut very thin, salted, and peppered, wrapped 
in greased paper, and broiled until thoroughly cooked, — 
from ten to fifteen minutes. To fry or saute them, cook 
them in a hot frying-pan in a little hot lard or salt pork fat. 
Cook slowly after the^- are brown, and be careful not to 
burn them. If a gravy be desired, pour oflT nearly all the 
fat left in the frying-pan, add two tablespoouftds of flour, 
and when brown add hot water until of the desired consist- 
ency. Season with salt, pepper, vinegar, and chopped 
pickles. 

Breakfast Bacon. — Cut off the rind and smoked part; 
slice very thin ; cook in a fryhig-pan till the fat is tried 
out and the bacon is dry and crisp, or fry in deep fat. 
Drain on paper, and serve alone or as a garnish for 
beefsteak. 

Fried Salt Pork. — Cut fat salt pork in thin slices ; pour 
hot water over them ; drain, and fry in a pan until crisp ; 
or roll in egg and crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Serve 
with salt fsh or fried mush or baked potatoes. 



Ham. 247 



Boiled Ham. 



If very salt, let it soak over night. Scrub well ; trim off 
the hard black part, cover with cold water, and let it 
simmer slowlj', allowing half an hour to the pound. Take 
it from the fire ; let it remain in the water until nearly 
cold ; then peel off the skin and sprinkle sugar and grated 
breads or cracker crumbs, over the top, and brown in the 
oven. Or boil until nearly tender ; remove the skin and 
bake two hours ; baste often with vinegar. Cover with 
crumbs, return to the oven, and brown. Or omit the 
crumbs and cover with a paste made with 07ie teaspoonfid 
of brown flour and licdf a cup of brown sugar, moistened 
with a httle port wine. Spread this over the ham, and 
brown in the oven. Serve with a brown sauce flavored 
with half a glass of champagne. Trim the knuckle with a 
paper ruffle. In carving, cut in ver}^ thin slices. Old 
hams are improved by adding a pint of vinegar and a table- 
spoonful of herbs to the water in which they are boiled. 
If the ham is not to be served whole, boil till it is very 
tender ; let it cool, and remove the skin and bones, and 
press it, with the fat well mixed with the lean. A boiled 
ham is done when the skin will peel easily. 

To serve Cold Boiled Ham. —Cut in thin slices ; season 
highly with cayenne pepper, or with mustard and lemon 
juice, and broil two minutes. 

Melt half a glass of currant jelly ; add a teaspoonfd of 
butter, a little pepper, and when hot add several small 
thin slices of ham. Let it boil up and serfe at once. 

Fried Ham. — Cut the ham in thin slices, remove the 
outside, gash the fat, and cook in a frying-pan till the 
fat is crisp. If cooked too long, it will become hard and 
dry. Ham will fry quicker and be less dry if cooked in 
hot lard or some of the ham fat from a previous frying. 

Broiled Ham. — Cut in very thin slices, and broil three 
or four minutes. Old or very salt ham should be parboiled 
five minutes before being broiled. Serve with poached eggs. 



248 The Boston Cook Book, 



If 3'ou like to know what you are eating, have 3'our 
sausage meat prepared at home or b}' some one whom jou 
can trust. Of sweet fresh porh take one third fat and two 
thirds lean, and chop fine, or have it ground bj' your 
butcher. Season highh' with salt, pepper, and sage 
(use the whole sage ; dry, pound, and sift it). Mix thor- 
oughly. Make cotton bags, one yard long and four 
inches wide. Dip them in strong salt and water, and dr}' 
before filling. Crowd the meat into the bags closel}', 
pressing it with a pestle or potato-masher. Tie the bag 
tightly and keep in a cool place. When wanted for use, 
turn the end of the bag back, and cut off the meat in half- 
inch slices, and cook in a frying-pan till brown. Core 
and quarter several apples, and fry in the hot fat and serve 
with the sausages. 

A safe rule in seasoning sausage meat is one even table- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sifted sage, and a scant 
half-teaspoonful of white pepper to each pound of meat. 

Souse. 

Take the gristly part of the pig's head, but not the fat; 
also the ears and feet. Remove the hard part from the 
feet. Scald or singe the hairs, soak in warm water, and 
scrape thoroughly. Let them remain in salt and water 
for ten hours. Scrape, and clean again, and put them a 
second tim6 in freshly salted water. With proper care 
they will be perfectly clean. Put them in a kettle and 
cover with cold water ; skim when it begins to boil ; set 
back and let it simmer till the bones shp out easily. Skim 
out the meat, and remove the hard gristle, bones, and 
any superfluous fat. Season with salt, pepper, and vinegar, 
and pack in stone jars. When hard, cut in slices, and 
brown in the oven. 

Head Cheese. — Prepare the same as souse, omitting the 
Tinegar, and season with sage. Put into a strainer cloth, 



Baked Beans, 249 



and press out the fat. Pack it in jars or moulds. Serve 
cold, or brown slightl}' in a fiying-pan. 

Though seldom seen on modern tables, these dishes 
when carefully prepared are very acceptable to many who 
have pleasant recollections of them as served at ' ' grand- 
mother's table." 

To Try out Lard. 

Cut the leaves into small pieces ; remove all flesh and 
membrane ; put a few pieces in a kettle on the back of 
the stove, and when they are heated through, put in the 
remsiinder. Cook slowlj' until the scraps are crisp ; strain 
through a fine cloth into tin pails or pans, and press that 
obtained from the scraps into a separate pail. Never put 
water with the leaves, as the object is to expel that which 
the}' alreadj' contain, and there is no danger of burning 
if onl}' a few pieces be put in at first, and the kettle be 
not over the hot fire. The kettle should not be covered 
until the scraps are crisp ; then cover it, and if no steam 
condenses on the cover, the water is evaDorated. 

Baked Pork and Beans. 

Soak one quart of pea beans in cold water over night. 
In the morning put them into fresh cold water, and simmer 
till soft enough to pierce with a pin, being careful not to 
let them boil enough to break. If 3'ou like, boil one onion 
with them. When soft, turn them into a colander, and 
pour cold water through them. Place them with the onion 
in a bean-pot. Pour boiling water over one quarter of a 
pound of salt pork^ part fat and part lean ; scrape the rind 
till white. Cut the rind in half-inch sti'ips ; bury the pork 
in the beans, leaving onl}' the rind exposed. Mix one 
teaspoonfid of salt — more, if the pork is not very salt — 
and one teaspoonful of mustard with one quarter of a cup of 
molasses. Fill the cup with hot water, and when well 
mixed pour it over the beans ; add enough more water to 
cover them. Keep them covered -^'^^ water until the

last hour ; tlieu lift the pork to the surface aud let it crisp. 
Bake eight hours in a moderate oven. Use more salt and 
one third of a cup of butter if 3'ou dislike pork, or use 
half a pound of fat and lean corned beef. 

The mustard gives the beans a delicious flavor, and 
also renders them more wholesome. Many add a tea- 
spoonful of soda to the water in which the beans are boiled, 
to destro}" the acid in the skin of the beans. Yellow-e^'ed 
beans and Lima beans are also good when baked. 

Much of the excellence of baked beans depends upon the 
bean-pot. It should be earthen, with a narrow mouth and 
bulging sides. This shape is seldom found outside of 
New England, and is said to have been modelled after the 
Ass3Tian pots. In spite of the slurs against "Boston 
Baked Beans " it is often remarked that strangers enjo}^ 
them as much as natives ; and man}' a New England bean- 
pot has been carried to the extreme South and West, that 
people there might have "baked beans" in perfection. 
They afibrd a nutritious and cheap food for people who 
labor in the open air. 

Parsnip and Pork Stew. 

Clean aud scrape the rind of one quarter of a pound of 
fat salt pork. Put it on to boil in two quarts of cold ivater. 
Put with it any remnants of cold roast pork or p)ork 
chops, first removing any burned parts ; or you may use 
one ijound of fresh, uncooked pork, or only the salt pork, 
if you prefer. After it has stewed for an hour, skim off 
the fat. Wash and scrape two large 2^ci'>'snips, cut then, 
in inch slices, and add them to the stew ; add, also, one 
small onion, sliced. Half an hour before dinner, add 
four or Jive potatoes, cut in small pieces, and parboiled 
five minutes. When done, skim out the meat and vegeta- 
bles, thicken the liquor with flour and water, add more 
salt and pepper, if necessary, cook ten minutes longer, 
then pour it over the meat. 



Poultry. 251 



POULTRY AND GAME. 

The flesh of poultiy and of game birds has less red 
blood than the flesh of animals ; but as it abounds in phos- 
phates, it is valuable food, particularly' for invalids. The 
flesh is drier, and not marbled with fat as in that of quad- 
rupeds. All game has a strong odor and flavor, which is 
by some mistaken for that of tainted meat. It should be 
kept till tender, but no longer, unless frozen. 

White-fleshed game should be cooked till well done ; 
that with dark flesh ma}^ be served underdone. The 
breast of all birds is the most juicy and nutritious part. 
' ' The wing of a walker and the leg of a flier are consid- 
ered choice tidbits." 

To Choose Poultry and Game. — The best chichens have 
soft 3'ellow feet, short thick legs, smooth moist skin, plump 
breast ; and the cartilage on the end of the breast bone 
is soft and pliable. This is sometimes broken in fowls to 
deceive purchasers ; but the difference between a broken 
bone, that slips when moved, and a soft yielding cartilage 
may be very easily detected. Pin feathers always indicate 
a young bird ; and long hairs, an older one. TKe bodies 
of capons are very plump and fat, and larger in proportion 
than those of fowls or chickens. The meat is of finer 
flavor. 

Old foivls have long thin necks and feet, and sharp 
scales ; the flesh has a purplish tinge, and they usually have 
a large amount of fat. 

The best turkeys have smooth black legs, with soft, 
loose spurs, full breasts, and white plump flesh. 

Geese and duchs should be young, not more than a year 
Old, have white soft fat, yellow feet, and tender wings, 
and be thick and hard on the breast. The windpipe 



252 The Boston Cook Book. 

should break when pressed with the thumb and finger. 
Wild ducks have reddish feet. Tame ducks have thick 
3'ellowish feet. 

Young pigeons have light red flesh on the breast, and 
full flesh-colored legs. Old pigeons are thin, and the breast 
very dark. Wild pigeons are cheaper, but are dr}- and tough. 
Stall-fed pigeons are the best. Squabs are young tame 
pigeons, and always have pin feathers. 

Grouse^ partridge^ and quail should have full heavy 
breasts, dark bills, and yellowish legs. 

Young rabbits should have smooth, sharp claws, tender 
ears and paws, and short necks. 

VeJiison should be dark red, with some white fat. 

To Clean and Truss Poultry and Game. — The practice 
of sending poultry to market undressed is one that de- 
mands as earnest opposition from housekeepers as that of 
the adulteration of food. The meat is rendered unfit to 
eat, is sometimes infected with poison ; and the increase in 
weight makes poultr}^ a ver}- expensive food. All poultry 
should be dressed as soon as killed. The feathers come 
out more easilj' when the fowl is warm, and when stripped 
ofi" toward the head. If the skin be ver}- tender, pull the 
feathers out the opposite waj\ Use a knife to remove the 
pin feathers. Singe the hairs and down by holding the 
fowl over a gas jet, or over a roll of lighted paper held 
over the fire. Cut off" the head, and if the fowl is to be 
roasted, slip the skin back from the neck and cut the neck 
off close to the bod}', leaving skin enough to fold over on 
the back. Remove the windpipe ; pull the crop away 
from the skin on the neck and breast, and cut ofl" close to 
the opening into the body. Be careful not to tear the skin. 
Alwa3's pull the crop out from the end of the neck, rather 
than through a cut in the skin, which if made has to be 
sewed together. Cut through the skin about two inches 
below the leg joint ; bend the leg at the cut b}^ pressing it 
on the edge of the table, and break off the bone. Then 
pull, not cut, out the tendons. If care be taken to cut 
only through the skin, these cords may be pulled out easily, 



Fowl. 253 

one at a time, with the fingers. Or take them all out at 
once, by putting the foot of the fowl against the easing of 
a door, then shut the door tightl}' and pull on the leg. 
The tendons will come out with the foot ; but if once cut 
the}' cannot be removed. The drumstick of a roast chicken 
or turkey is great!}' improved b}^ removing the tendons, 
which alwaj's become hard and bony in baking. There is 
a special advantage in cutting the leg below the joint, as 
the ends of the bones afford more length for t3ing, and 
after roasting this is easily broken off, leaving a clean, un- 
burned joint for the table. Cut out the oil bag in the tail. 
It is better to dress a fowl for a fricassee first. Then you 
learn the position of the internal organs, and can tell bet- 
ter how to remove them when dressing for roasting, as 
with the whole fowl you work by feeling and not by sight. 

To Out up a Fowl for a Fricassee. — Cut through the 
loose skin between the legs and body, bend the leg over, 
and cut off at the joint ; then cut off the wings. Make an 
incision in the skin near the vent, and cut the membrane 
lying between the breastbone and the tail, down to the 
backbone, on each side. Then you have the intestines, 
gizzard, liver, and heart exposed, and can easil}' remove 
them. T)o not forget the kidne3's, lying in the hollow of 
the backbone, and the lungs in the ribs. Cut the ribs 
through the cartilage, separate the collar bone, and break 
the backbone just below the ribs. Divide at the joints 
in the wings and legs ; separate the side bones from the 
back, and remove the bone from the breast. Never chop 
the bones, but divide smoothly at the joints. 

To Dress a Fowl for Roasting. — Make an incision near 
the vent ; insert two fingers, loosen the fat from the skin, 
and separate the membranes lying close to the bod}'. 
Keep the fingers up close to the breastbone, until 3'ou can 
reach in be^'ond the liver and heart, and loosen on either 
side down toward the back. The gall bladder lies under 
the lobe of the liver on the left side, and if the fingers be 
kept up, and everything loosened before drawing out, 
there will be no danger of its breaking. The kidneys and 



254 ^^ Boston Cook Book. 

lungs are often left in by careless cooks ; but everything 
that can be taken out must be removed. When the fowl 
has been cleaned carefully, it will not require much wash- 
ing. Hold it under the faucet, or rinse out the inside 
quickly ; then wipe ([ry. 

If the breastbone protrude more than is desirable, put a 
small knife in at the opening, and cut through the cartilage 
in the ribs or through the breastbone. Or put a pestle 
in the inside, lay a towel over the breast, and pound slightly 
until the bone gives way. 

To Stuff a Fowl. — Place the fowl in a bowl, and put 
the stuffing in at the neck ; fill out the breast until plump 
and even. Then draw the neck skin together at the end, 
and sew it over on the back. Put the remainder of the 
stuffing into the body at the other opening, and if full, sew 
it with coarse thread or fine twine. If not full, sewing is 
unnecessary, except when the fowl is to be boiledo 

To Truss a Fowl. — Draw the thighs up close to the bod}^, 
and cross the legs over the tail, and tie firmh^ with twine. 
Put a long skewer through the thigh into the body and out 
through the opposite thigh, and another through the wings, 
drawing them close to the body. Wind a string from 
the tail to the skewer in the thigh, then up to the one in the 
wing, across the back to the other wing, then down to the 
opposite thigh, and tie firmly round the tail. If you have 
no skewers, the strings must be passed round the body, 
over the thighs and wings ; and care must be taken, in 
removing them, not to tear the browned crust on the breast. 
Sometimes the feet are cut off in the joint, and the legs 
passed into the body and out through an opening under 
the sidebone near the tail, or left in the body and covered 
with the skin. 

To Clean the Giblets. — Slip off the thin membrane round 
the heart, cut out the veins and arteries, remove the liver, 
and cut off all that looks green near the gall bladder. 
Trim the fat and membranes from the gizzard, cut through 
the thick part ; open it, and remove the inner lining with- 
out breaking. Cut off all the white gristle, and use only 



Carving Poultry. 255 



the thick fleshy part. Wash, and put them in cold water, 
and simmer till tender. The neck and tips of the wings 
are often cooked with the giblets. 

These directions apply to all kinds of poultry and game. 

Wild ducks, coot, and geese should be washed thor- 
oughly on the outside before being drawn. Scrub them 
with slight!}^ warm water and soap. The skin is very thick 
and oil}', and it is impossible to get it clean without 
soap. 

The strong smell in old fowls may be removed by wash- 
ing in warm soda water. 

To dress Fowls or Birds for Broiling. — Singe, wipe, and 
split down the middle of the back ; lay open, and then 
remove the contents from the inside. Cut the tendons in 
the thigh, or break the joints, and remove the breastbone 
to facilitate the carving. 

To Carve Poultry. — Place the fowl on the platter, with 
the head at the left. Put the fork in across the breast- 
bone. Cut through the skin round the leg joint. Bend 
the leg over and cut off at the joint. Then cut off the 
wings, and divide wings and legs at the joints. Carve the 
breast in thin slices parallel with the breastbone. Some 
prefer to cut it at right angles with the bone. Take off 
the wish-bone ; separate the collar-bone from the breast ; 
slip the knife under the shoulder blade, and turn it over. 
Cut through the cartilage which divides the ribs, separat- 
ing the breast from the back. Then turn the back over, 
place the knife midwa}', and with the fork lift up the tail 
end, separating the back from the bod}'. Place the fork 
in the middle of the backbone, and cut close to the back- 
bone, from one end to the other, freeing the side bone. 
As soon as the legs and wings are disjointed, begin to 
serve, offering white or dark meat and stuffing as each 
prefers. Do not remove the fork from the breastbone till 
the breast is separated from the back. Use an extra fork 
in serving. If all the fowl be not required, carve onlj^ 
from one side, leaving the opposite side whole for another 
meal. 



256 Tlie Boston Cook Booh, 

Gravy for Roast Poultry and Garyie. — Put the giblets^ or 
neck, liver, gizzard, and heart, on to boil in one quart of 
water ^ and boil till tender, and the water reduced to one 
pint. Mash the liver, and if desired chop the gizzard, 
heart, and meat from the neck. Pour off the clear fat 
from the dripping-pan, and put the settlings into a sauce- 
pan ; rinse out the pan with the water in which the giblets 
were boiled, and pour this water into the saucepan and 
put on to boil. Put three or four tahlespoonfuls of the fat 
into a small frj'ing-pan ; add enough dry flour to absorb 
all the fat, and when brown add the giblet liquor gradu- 
ally, and stir till it thickens. Season with salt and pep- 
per. If not smooth, strain it ; pour half of it into the 
gravy boat, and add the chopped giblets to the remaining 
half, and serve separately', as all may not care for the 
giblet gravy. 

Roast Turkey. 

Clean as directed on page 252. Stuff with soft bread ov 
cracker crumbs highly seasoned with sage^ thyme., salt^ 
and pepper ; moisten the stuffing with half a cup of melted 
butter., and hot water enough to make it quite moist. Add 
one beaten egg. Some use salt pork chopped fine, but 
stuffing is more wholesome without it. Oysters, chestnuts^ 
chopped celery, stoned raisins, or dates make a pleasing 
variet}'. 

For Stuffing and Trussing, see page 254. Put the turkey 
on a rack in a pan, rub well with butter, and dredge with 
salt, pepper, and flour. Put in a hot oven, and when the 
flour is browned reduce the heat, and add a pint of ivater. 
Baste with butter until nicely browned ; then with the fat 
in the pan. Baste often, and dredge with salt and flour 
after every basting. Allow three hours for an eight-pound 
turke\\ Cook till the legs will separate from the body. 
Prepare the gravy as directed above. Garnish the tur- 
kc}' with parsley or celery leaves and sausages or force-meat 
balls. Serve cranberry sauce or currant jelly with roast 
turke}'. 



Roast Chicken 257 



If the giblets be not desired in ttie gravy, the}' ma}- be 
boiled, chopped fine, and mixed with the stuffing ; or 
make them into force-meat balls, with an equal amount of 
soft bread crumbs. Moisten, and season highly, and brown 
them in hot butter. 

Boiled or Steamed Turkey or Fowl. 

Clean; rub well with salt^ pepper^ and lemon juice, and 
stuff with 01/ster or bread stuffing. It is better without the 
stuffing, as the oysters are usually over-done, and the 
same flavor may be obtained from an oyster sauce served 
with the turkey. Truss the legs and wings close to the 
body ; pin the fowl in a cloth to keep it whiter and preserve 
the shape. Put into boiUng salted water. Allow twenty 
minutes to the pound. Cook slowly till tender, but not 
long enough for it to fall apart. Turkeys are much nicer 
steamed than boiled. Serve with oyster, celery, lemon, 
or caper sauce. Garnish with a border of boiled rice or 
macaroni, and pour part of the sauce over the fowl. 

Fowls are sometimes stuffed with boiled celery, cut into 
pieces an inch long ; or with macaroni which has been 
boiled and seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Roast Chicken. 

Singe ; remove the pin feathers, oil bag, crop, entrails, 
legs, and tendons. Wipe, stuff, sew, and tie or skewer 
into shape. Place it on one side, on a rack in a dripping- 
pan, without water. Dredge, and rub all over with scdt, 
pepper, soft butter, and flour. Put chicken fat or beef drip- 
pings over it and in the pan. Roast in a hot oven, with 
a rack under the pan. When the flour is brown, check 
the heat, baste with the fat, and afterwards with one third 
of a cup of butter, melted in one cup of hot 2vater. When 
brown, turn the other side up ; then place it on the back, 
that the breast may be browned. Baste often, and dredge 
with flour after basting. Add more water if needed. 
Bake a four-pound chicken an hour and a half, or till the 

17 



258 The Boston Cook Book 



joints separate eas%. Lay buttered paper over it, if it 
brown too fast. 

Stuffing. — Moisten 07ie cup of cracker or soft bread crumbs 
with one third of a cup of melted butter ; season highly 
with salt, pepper, and thyme. 

Chestnut Stuffing. — Shell one quart of large chestnuts. 
Pour on boiling water, and remove the inner brown skin. 
Boil in scdted water or stock till soft. Mash fine. Take 
half for the stuffing, and mix with it one cup oi fine cracker 
crumbs ; season with one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoon- 
ful of pepper, and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. 
Moisten with one third of a cup of melted butter. Profes- 
sional cooks sometimes mix a Uttle apple sauce, flavored 
with wine, lemon, and sugar, with a chestnut stuffing. 

Chestnut Sauce. —^QUio\Q the fat from the dripping- 
pan ; add nearly a pint of hot icater ; thicken with flour 
which has been cooked in brown butter ; add salt and pepper, 
and the remainder of the chestnuts^ 

Braised Fowl. 

Prepare the same as for roasting; dredge with salt., 
pepper, and flour, and brown slightly in hot butter or 
chicken fat in a frying-pan. Put in a deep pan; half 
cover with water. Add the giblets, one onion, and one table- 
spoonful of herbs tied in a bag. Cover with a tightly fitting 
pan, and bake till tender, basting often. Chop the gib- 
lets, thicken, season, and strain the gravy ; add the giblets, 
and pour around the fowl. 

Chicken Fricassee. 

Singe, and cut the chicken at the joints, in pieces for 
serving Cover with boiling water ; add one heaping teaspoon- 
ful of saltj and half a saltspoonfid of pepper. Simmer one 
hour, or till tender, reducing the water to nearly a pint. 
Remove all the large bones, dredge with salt, pepper, and 
flour, and brown in hot butter. Put the chicken on toast 
on a hot platter. Strain the liquor and remove the fat. 



Chicken Curry. 259 



Add to the liquor one cup of cream or milk^ and heat ifr 
again. Melt one large tablespoonfal of butter in a saucepan ; 
add two tablespoonfuls of Jlour^ and when well mixed pour 
on slowly the cream and chicken liquor. Add salt^ pepper^ 
half a teaspoonful of celery salt, one teaspoonful of lemon juice. 
Beat one egg ; pour the sauce slow!}' on the egg ; stir well, 
and pour over the chicken. The chicken may be browned 
before cooking, then stewed, and a brown gravy made hy 
browning the butter before adding the flour. Half a can 
of mushrooms ma}' be added to improve the flavor, letting 
them simmer in the sauce five minutes. Arrange the body 
of the chicken in the centre of the dish, with the wings at 
the top, the thighs below, and the ends of the drumsticks 
crossed at the tail. 

If the chicken be not fried, it is simph' a chicken stew f 
and dumplings may be added, or not, as 3'ou prefer. And 
if put into a deep dish with a rich gravy, made as for 
fricassee, but without the ego^, and covered with a rich 
crust of pastry and baked, it is chicken pie. 

Chicken Curry. 

Cut the chicken at the joints, and remove the breast 
bones. Wipe, season with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour, and brown lightly in hot butter. Put in a stewpan. 
Fry one large onion, cut in thin slices, in the butter left in 
the pan till colored, but not browned. Mix one large 
tablespoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of sugar, and one 
tablespoonful of curry powder, and brown them in the but- 
ter. Add slowly one cup of water or stock and one cup of 
strained tomatoes, or one sour apple chopped, and scdt and 
pepper to taste. Pour this sauce over the chicken, and 
simmer one hour, or till tender. Add one cup of hot milk 
or cream. Boil one minute longer, and serve with a bor- 
der of boiled rice. 

Rabbit, veal, and lamb may be curried in the same 
way. 



26o The Boston Cook Booh, 



Broiled Chicken. 

Singe, and split a 3'oung spring chicken down the back. 
Break the joints ; remove the breastbone, clean, and wipe 
with a wet cloth. Sprinkle with salt and pepper^ and rub 
well with soft butter. Place in a double gridiron, and broil 
twent}' minutes over a clear fire. Spread with hitter^ and 
serve very hot. Or cover with fine bread crujnbs and bake 
in a hot oven half an hour. Serve with Tartar sauce. 

To Carve. — Separate the legs and wings, and then sep- 
arate the breast from the lower part. 



Fried Chicken. 

Singe ; cut at the joints ; remove the breast bones. 
Wipe each piece with a clean wet cloth ; dredge with salt., 
pepper^ and flour^ and saute them in hot salt pork fat till 
brown and tender, but not burned. Arrange on a dish, 
with boiled cauliflower or potato halls, and pour a iv/iite 
sauce over them. Or dip in egg and crumbs, and fry la 
deep hot fat, and serve with tomato sauce. 



Broiled Fillets of Chicken. 

Remove the bone from the breast and thighs. Rub the 
meat with butter or olive oil ; season, and cover with fine 
cracker dust. Broil about ten minutes. 



Devilled Chicken. 

Boil a chicken until tender in boiUng salted water. 
When cold, cut at the joints, baste with soft butter, and 
broil till brown. Or cut anj' cold boiled or roasted chicken 
at the joints, rub with salt and butter, and broil till warmed 
through. Pour hot Tartar sauce over them. Or make 
several incisions in the flesh, and rub with mustard and 
cayenne pepper before broiling. 



Geese ^ Ducks. 261 



Roast Goose. 

Singe, remove the pin feathers, and before it is cut or 
drawn, wash and scrub thoroughly in warm soapsuds, to 
open and cleanse the pores, and render the oil more easy 
to be extracted. Then draw, as directed on page 253. 
Wash and rinse the inside in clear water, and wipe dry. 
Stuff with mashed potatoes highly seasoned with onion^ 
sage, salt, and pepper, or with equal parts of bread crumbs, 
chopped apples, and boiled onions, seasoned with salt, sage, 
Sind pepper. Sew and truss ; put on a rack in a pan, and 
cover the breast with slices of fat salt pork. Place in the 
oven for three quarters of an hour. Tlie pork fat is 
quickly drawn out by the heat, flows over tlie goose, and 
aids in drawing out the oil. When considerable oil is 
extracted, take the pan from the oven, and pour off all the 
oil. Remove the pork, and dredge the goose with flour, 
and place again in the oven. When the flour is browned, 
add a little hot water, and baste often. Dredge with flour 
after basting. Cook until brown and tender. Make a 
gravy as on page 256. Garnish with watercresses. Serve 
with apple sauce. 

Roast Ducks. 

Pick, singe, and remove the crop, entrails, oil bag, legs, 
and pinions. Wipe, truss, dredge with salt, pepper, butter, 
and flour. Bake in a hot oven twent}^ minutes if liked 
rare, or thirt}^ minutes if preferred w^ell done. Serve with 
olive sauce and green peas. Geese and ducks have a strong 
flavor, and are improved by stuffing the craw and body 
with apples cored and quartered. The apples absorb the 
strong flavor, therefore should not be eaten. Celery and 
onions are also placed inside the duck, to improve its 
flavor. 

Braised Ducks. 

Ducks that are tough and unfit to roast are improved 
by being braised with onions, carrots, and turnips. Or 
they may be stewed, and served with canned /^eas. 



262 The Boston Cook Book, 



Larded Grouse. 

Clean, wipe, lard the breast and legs, and truss. Rub 
with salt and soft butter^ and dredge with flour. Roast 
twenty minutes in a quick oven if liked rare, thirty minutes 
if well done. Serve with bread sauce. 



Potted Pigeons. 

Draw and clean. Break the legs just above the feet ; 
leave enough below the joint to tie down to the tail. 
Wash and wipe. If old and tough, cover them with vine- 
gar., spiced and flavored with onion., and let them stand 
several hours. This makes them tender. Drain and wipe ; 
stuff, if you like, with cracker crumbs highly seasoned and 
moistened with butter. Dredge with salt., pepper., and flour. 
Frj' several slices of salt pork ; cut one large onion fine, 
and fry in the salt pork fat. Put the crisp fat in the stew- 
pan, add the fried onion, then brown the pigeons all over 
in the fat left in the pan. Put them in the stewpan ; add 
boiling water or stock enough to half cover them ; add a 
pinch of herbs tied in a bag. Simmer from one to three 
hours, or till the pigeons are tender. Remove the fat 
from the broth, season to taste, and thicken with flour 
and butter cooked together. Strain over the pigeons, and 
serve hot. 

Braised Pigeons. 

Prepare the pigeons as for potted pigeons, and cook in a 
braising-pan. Cook spinach (see page 296) ; chop it fine, 
and season. Spread the spinach on slices of toast^ and 
lay the pigeons on the spinach one on each slice. Serve 
the gravy in a boat. 

Pigeons Stuffed with Parsley. {Miss Ward.) 

Allow one pint of loose parsley for each pigeon. Wash, 
remove the large stems, and chop very fine, adding salt 



Birds. 263 



and pepper and two or three tahlespoonfuls of water while 
chopping. Stuff the pigeons with the parsley ; add also 
the hem^t and a half-inch cube of salt pork for each pigeon. 
Add the water left in the tra}' to that in the stewpan, 
and cook as in the preceding rule. 

Roast Birds, 

Draw, and wash quickl}' ; season with salt and pepper. 
Pin a thin slice of salt pork on the breast. Put on a shal- 
low pan, and bake in a hot oven, fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Baste often. Serve on toast with currant jelly or with 
bread sauce. Small birds may be baked in sweet potatoes^ 
or if large cut in halves, using the breast onl3\ Cut the 
potatoes in halves lengthwise, make a cavity in each 
half, season the bird with salt., pepper., and butter; fit 
it into the potato, put the other half over it, and bake 
till the potatoes are soft. Remove the string, tie with a 
bright ribbon, and serve in the potatoes, garnished with 
parsley. An inviting dish to serve to an invalid. 

Small birds are also broiled or stewed. 

Quail. 

Quail ma}^ be roasted, broiled, or braised ; or the breasts 
onl}' ma}' be removed and broiled. Use the bones and 
trimminos to make stock for a rich sauce. 



Woodcock. 

Dress, and wipe clean. Dredge inside and out with salt 
and pepper ; tie the legs close to the bod}', skin the head 
and neck, and tie the beak under the wings. Tie a piece 
of bacon over the breast, and fvy in boiling lard two 
minutes ; or roast in the oven, and serve on toast. 

Venison. 

Venison is one of the most easih' digested meats. It 
may be cooked after the same rules as mutton or beef. It 



264 



The Boston Cook Book, 



should be cooked rare, and served ver}- hot with currant 
jelly. The saddle, or loin, is the choicest cut for roasting 
or for steaks. Steaks are also cut from the leg. 

Venison steaks should be broiled the same as beefsteaks, 
and served with Maitre d' Hotel butter, made with currant 
jelly instead of lemon juice. The cheaper, tougher parts 
of venison may be stewed or braised. Venison should be 
wiped carefully before cooking, as the hairs are often found 
clinging to the meat. 

Rabbits and Squirrels. 

These may be cooked the same as chickens, — stewed, 
fricasseed, or larded and baked.

Stuffing for cuHen Turkey weighing Eight Pounds. — The 
meat from a four-pound chicken^ one pound of raw^ lean 
veal, one cup of cracker crumbs, two eggs, boiling stock enough 
to moisten, salt, pepper, and thgme to taste, and 07ie cup of 
potted ham or tongue.

long thin strips, la}' it aside, and chop all the remainder 
with the veal. Do not use an}' salt pork unless you wish 
the stuffing to taste like sausage meat. Add the cracker 
crumbs ; make it quite moist with hot stock, and season 
to taste. Fill the legs and wings of the turkey with the force- 
meat. Put the fillets, which came out in boning, on the 
skin below the breast ; then a layer of force-meat with 
a little of the tongue here and there ; or you may use thin 
slices of boiled tongue or ham. Then a layer of the re- 
served meat from the chicken, and force-meat again. Sew 
and tie into the natural shape. Or, if for a galantine, turn 
the legs and wings inside before stuffing, and roll up. Sew 
tightly in a cloth. Put the bones of chicken and turkey

and all the trimmings from the veal in a kettle, and cover 
with cold water. Steam the turke3' over the bones three 
hours. Remove the cloth, dredge with salt and fiour^ and 
bake one hour or until nicely browned. Serve cold, and 
garnish with parsley^ sparkling jelly ^ carrots^ and heets cut 
into fanc}' shapes, or with potato balls. Carve in slices 
across the breast. 

When the turkey is to be moulded in jelly, strain the 
liquor in which the bones were boiled; remove the fat, 
clear, and stiffen with gelatine as directed below. Make a 
brown aspic jelly with soup stock. Mould in the dark 
jelly and garnish with the light, or vice versa.

given in stuffing for turkey, according to the size of the 
fowl. Lardoons of pork may be inserted all over the top 
when the chicken is to be browned in the oven. 

To Mould in Aspic Jelly. — Take enough stock to fill the 
mould, — heef'if for dark jelly, and veal or chicken, if for 
light. Season highly with salt, pepper, celery seed, herbs^ 
kmon, or wine. If a darker shade be desired, add a little 
caramel. For three pints of stock mix the tvhifes and shells 
of two eggs with the cold stock ; add one box of Cox's gela- 
tine which has been soaked in one cup of cold water. Put 
all over the fire, and stir till hot. Boil till a thick scum 
has formed ; remove that, and strain the liquor through a 
fine napkin. 

Pack a mould in a pan of snow or broken ice, and pour 
in jelly to the depth of half an inch. When hard, garnish 



Boned Turkey, 267 




with fanci/ vegetables of different colors^ slices of hard-boiled 

eggs, Italian paste, rings of macaroni, etc. Fasten each 

ornament in place with hquid jell}', and when hard add 

enough jell}^ to cover all. When this is hard, place the 

meat, or whatever you have to mould, in the centre, being 

careful not to let it 

break the jell}*. Keep 

the meat in place with 

some of the liquid jel- 

h', and when hard add 

enough jelly to fill the 

mould. If to be dec- ^^^ 3^ ^^^.^j^^,^ .^ ,^,^^ 

orated on the side, dip 

the ornaments in the liquid jell}', and if the mould be icy 

cold, they will adhere. The jelly must be added slowly. 

Keep in the mould in a cool place till ready to serve. 

To remove it, dip the mould quickly in warm (not hot) 

water, put the dish over it, and invert dish and mould 

together. Garnish viith parsley and sparkling jelly. 

Tongue, boned turkey or chicken, birds, moulds of differeni 
kinds of meat smdjish, etc., may be served in jelly. 

Pressed Chicken. 

An Easy Way of Preparing Boneless Chicken. — Boil a 
fowl in as little water as possible till the bones slip out 
and the gristly portions are soft. Remove the skin, pick 
the meat apart, and mix the dark and white meats. Re- 
move the fat, and season the liquor highly with salt and 
pepper; also with celery salt and lemon juice, if you like. 
Boil down to Q7ie cupful, and mix with the meat. Butter 
a mould, and decorate the bottom and sides with slices of 
hard-boiled eggs ; also with thin slices of tongue or ham cut 
into round or fancy shapes. Pack the meat in, and set 
away to cool with a weight on the meat. When ready to 
serve, dip the mould in warm water, and turn out carefully. 
Garnish with parsley, strips of lettuce or celery leaves, an(3 
radishes or beets.

and garnish with triangles of toast. 

Scalloped Chicken. 

Take equal parts of cold chicken^ boiled rice or macaroni^ 
and tomato sauce. Put in layers in a shallow dish, and 
cover with buttered crumbs. Bake till brown. Cold roast 
turkey, using stuffing and gravy, may be prepared in the 
same way. 

Chicken Pie for Thanksgiving. {Miss A. M. Towne.) 

Two chickens, three pints of cream, one pound of butter^ 
flour enough to make a stiff crust. Cut the chicken at 
the joints, and cook in boihng salted water till tender. 

Crust. — TTiree pints of cream, one heaping teaspoonful of 
mlt, QXidi flour to mix it hard enough to roll out easily. 

Line a deep earthen dish having flaring sides with a 
thin laj'er of paste. Roll the remainder of the paste half 
an inch thick. Cut three quarters of a pound of butter into 



CMeken Pie. 269 



small pieces, and put them on the dough quite close to- 
gether. Sprinkle a little flour over the butter, and roll 
the paste over and over. Roll out again half an inch thick 
and roU up. Cut otf from the ends of the roll, turn the 
pieces over and roll out half an inch thick for rims. Wet 
the paste in the dish with milk, and la}- the rims round 
the sides of the dish. Put on two, three, or four rims, 
showing one above another, the inside rim the highest. 
Wet each rim to make it adhere. Fill the centre with the 
parboiled chicken. Take out some of the larger bones. 
Season the chicken liquor with salt and pepj)ei\ and pour 
it over the chicken ; use enough to nearl}' cover. Cut the 
remaining quarter of butter into pieces the size of a chest- 
nut, and put them OTcr the meat. Roll the remainder of 
the crust to fit the top. Make a curving cut in the crust 
and turn it back, that the steam ma}^ escape. Bake three 
hours in a brick oven. If baked in a stove oven, put on 
onl}' two rims of crust and bake two hours. 

Chicken Terrapin. (Miss 3Iinot.) 

Chop one cold roast chicken and one parboiled sweet- 
bread moderateh' fine. Make ojie cup of rich cream sauce, 
with one cup of hot cream ^ a quarter of a cup of butter^ and 
two tablespoonfuls of flour. Then put in the chicken and 
sweetbread. Salt and pepper to taste. Let it heat over 
hot water fifteen minutes. Just before serving add the

juice or vinegar^ a speck of cayenne^ two eggs^ well beaten, 
and enough hot soup stock to make it quite moist. Add 
salt and pppper to taste, the amount depending upon the 
seasoning in the sausages. The sausages maj- be omitted, 
and a larger amount of chicken used. Butter a small 
mould, and pack the meat in closel}^ to within an inch ol 
the top to allow for swelling. Put it on a trivet in a kettle, 
and steam three hours. If no uncooked meat be used, 
one hour will be sufficient. Cool it in the mould ; when 
read}' to serve, dip the mould quickly into warm water 
and loosen the meat around the edges with a thin knife 
and remove the mould. It may be served plain or 
moulded in jelly (see page 266).

Fry two small onions., cut fine, in two tablespoonfids of but- 
ter till brown ; add tioo tablespoonfuls of flour ^ and stir till 
dark brown. Strain the liquor in which the bones were 
boiled, and add it gradually to the butter and flour. Add 
more salt if needed, one tablespoonful of lemon juice, two 
tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire sauce, and the pieces of 
meat. Simmer fifteen minutes ; add six or eight 7nush- 
rooms, and a glass of claret, if 3'ou like, or the juice of a sour 
oratige. Serve very hot on slices of fried, bread, and gar- 
nish with fried bread and parsley. Or serve canned peas 
in the centre, with the meat on toast around the edge.

Beef Rolls, 271 



tahlespoonful of the chopped mixture for each slice. Sea- 
son highl}^ with scdt^ pepper^ and herbs, and mix with one 
fourth as much cracker crumbs as meat. Spread this on 
each slice, nearl}' to the edge. Roll and tie. Dredge 
with salt, pepper, and flour, and fry brown in drippings or 
salt pork fat ; put in a stewpan, and make a brown gravy 
b}^ adding tioo tablespoonfids of flour to the fat left in the 
pan, and when brown pour on one pint of hot water. Sea- 
son with salt andpepjyer ; pour over the rolls and simmer till 
they are tender. Remove the strings, place the rolls on a 
platter, season the gravy and pour it over them. 

Rolls may be made in the same way by using raw lean 
meat from the round, cut in small thin slices ; pound it to 
break the fibre, and trim into shape. Rolls may be made 
of veal or thin slices of liver (parboil and remove the skin 
before using the liver) . If there be any of the chopped 
mixture left, make it into round or oval balls, roll in 
crumbs, then in egg, and again in crumbs ; and brown in 
the oven or fty in/«^. 

Beef Roideite. — Take a large thin slice of meat from 
the round, or an}' tough part ; pound it enough to break 
the fibre, and trim into rectangular shape. Season and 
spread with a stuffing ; roll, tie, and cook as directed for 
Beef Rolls. Serve hot with a gravy ; or cold, cut into thin 
slices. 

Fricadilloes, or Meat Balls, Sausages, or Rolls. 

Chop the meat fine ; add a slice of onion chopped fine, 
and if the meat be lean, add one or two slices of bacon ; sea- 
son highly with salt, pepper, sage, thyme, lemon juice, and 
parsley ; add one fourth as much bread crumbs or boiled rice 
as you have meat. Moisten with beaten egg and hot 
water or stock if needed ; shape like a ball, Q^g, or C3'linder. 
Brown them in drippings or butter in a frying-pan, or roll 
them in crumbs, egg, and crumbs again, and fry in hot 
deep/a^

potato^ and a small 
quantity of chopped 
bacon ; season highl}^ 
with salt., pepper., cay- 
enne^ and lemon juice; 
moisten with beaten 
egg and stock or water 
enough to shape it. 
Mould it into an oval loaf, and put into a shallow pan well 
greased. Cut strips o^ fat bacon., one fourth of an inch 
wide and one inch long. Make holes in the loaf with a 
small skewer, insert the strips of bacon, leaving the ends 
out half an inch, and push the meat up firmly round the

one large tahlespoonful of butter. When the butter is melted, 
add the hash, and let it simmer till it has absorbed the 
water and formed a brown crust. Do not stir it. Fold 
like an omelet. Use corned meat or roast beef. If the 
potatoes be cold, chop them with the meat. 

Sandwiches. 

Chop ver}' fine some coohed ham or cold corned beef or 
tongue with one-fourth part fat. Mix one teaspoonful of dry 
mustard and one saltspoojiful of salt with cold water to a stiff

potatoes shaped into a mound like a wall on the edge of 
a platter. Brush over with beaten ivhite or yolk of an egg, 
and brown slightly. Fill with am' kind of cooked meat or 
fish warmed in a white or brown sauce. 

Veal Birds. 

Slices of veal from the loin^ cut ver}* thin. Wipe, re- 
move the bones, skin, and fat, and pound till one fourth 
of an inch thick. Trim into pieces two and a half by 
four inches. Chop the trimmings fine with one square 
inch of fat salt pork for each bird. Add half as muchj^^ze

venieut wa}^ of using pieces of veal that would not other- 
wise be utilized. 

Veal Loaf. 

Parboil two pounds of lean veal. Chop fine with one 
fourth of a pound of salt pork or bacon ; add four butter 
crackers^ pounded, tivo eggs, well beaten, tivo teaspoonfuh 
of salt^ one saltspoonful of pepper^ and half a saltspoonful of

Potting. 277 



Potting. 

Chop and pound to a paste anj^ fragments of cooked 
ham^ tongue^ beef ^ poultry^ game^ ov fish. With ham use a 
quarter part fat. Remove all gristle and skin, and pound 
till free from an}' fibre and reduced to a paste. Season 
highl}' with salt^ jjtpper^ cayenne, and made mustard, and 
moisten with a little melted butter (except ham, which has 
fat enough) . Pack closely in small stone or earthen jars. 
Put the jars in a steamer, and heat for half an hour. Then 
press the meat down again, and cover with hot melted 
butter. This will keep some time, and maj' be served in 
slices or used for sandwiches. Ham and tongue may be 
mixed with veal or chicken. Beef, game, and fish^are 
better alone- 

Potted Liver. 

Braise a cairs or lamb's liver in rich, highly seasoned 
stock. When tender, cut fine and pound to a paste, add- 
ing enough of the strained liquor iu which it was cooked to 
moisten it; add half a cup of butter, melted and strained.

slices of lemon and hard-boiled eggs. 

Croquettes. ^ 

These may be made of an}- kind of cooked meat, fish, 
05'sters, rice, hominy, and many kinds of vegetables, or 
from a mixture of several ingredients. When mixed with 
a thick white sauce (see page 278), which adds ver}' 
much to the delicac}' of meat or fish croquettes, less meat 
is required. The sauce is a stiff paste when cold, and 
being mixed with the meat or fish the croquettes may be 



2/8 The Boston Cook Booh 

handled and shaped perfectly, and when cooked will be 
soft and creamj^ inside. 

To Shape a Croquette. — Croquettes may be shaped into 
rolls, or ovals, or like pears, with a bit of parsley or a 
clove in the end to represent the stem. Take a tahlespoon- 
ful of the cold mixture^ and shape into a smooth ball. If 
the mixture stick, wet the palms of the hands slightly. 
Give the ball a gentle, rolhng pressure between the palms 
till slightly cylindrical ; then roll it lightly in the crumbs, 
clasp it gently in the hand, and flatten one end on the 
board. Turn the hajjd over, and flatten the opposite end. 
Place the croquette on a broad knife, and roll it in beaten 
Qgg, With a spoon dip the egg over the croquette, drain 
on the knife, and folT again in the crumbs. Fry in deep 
hot fat (see page 15). Drain on paper. 

In rolling any kind of croquettes, if the mixture be too 
soft to be handled easih', stir in enough fine cracker dust 
to stiffen it, but never add an}' uncooked material liko 
flour, nor the dried bread crumbs used in rolling, as thost 
will make the croquettes too stiflf. 

Thick Cream Sauce (for Croquettes and Patties). 

3^2 teaspoonful salt. 



1 pint hot cream. 

2 even tablespoonfuls butter. 

4 heaping tablespoonfuls flour, or 
2 heaping tablesp. cornstarch. 



^2 saltspoonful white pepper. 
j^'o teaspoonful celery salt. 
A few grains of cayenne. 



Scald the cream. Melt the butter in a granite sauce- 
pan. When bubbling, add the dry cornstarch. Stir till 
well mixed. Add one third of tlie cream, and stir as it 
boils and thickens. Add more cream, and boil again. 
When perfectly smooth, add the remainder of the cream. 
The sauce should be very thick, almost like a drop batter. 
Add the seasoning, and mix it while hot with the meat or 
fish. For croquettes, one beaten egg ma}' be added just as 
the sauce is taken from the fire ; but the croquettes are 
whiter and more creamy without the egg. For patties, 
warm the meat or fish in the sauce, and use the egg or not 
as you please.

Fig. 38. Chicken Croquettes. 



Chicken Croquettes. — Half a pound of chicken chopped 
ver}' fine, and seasoned with half a teaspoonful of salt, halj 
a teaspoonful of celery salt, a quarter of a saltspoonful of 
cayenne pepper, one saltspoonful of white pepper, a few 
drops of onion juice, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and 
one teaspoonful of lemon juice. Make one pint of ver}' thick 
cream sauce (see page 278). When thick, add one beaten 
Bgg, and mix the sauce 
with the chicken, us- 
ing only enough to 
make it as soft as can 
be handled. Spread 
on a shallow plate 
to cool. Shape into 
rolls. Roll in fine 
bread crumbs, then dip 

in beaten egg, then in crumbs again, and fry one minute in 
smoking hot fat. Diain, and ser^e with a thin cream 
sauce. Many prefer to cut the chicken into small dice. 
If this be done, use less of the sauce, or the croquettes 
will be difficult to shape. The white meat of chicken will 
absorb more sauce than the dark. Mushrooms, boiled 
rice, sweetbreads, calf s brains, or veal may be mixed with 
chicken. Cold roast chicken, chopped fine, maj- be mixed 
with the stuffing, moistened with the gravy, and shaped 
into croquettes. 

Veal Croquettes. — Chop cold veal fine; season highl}^ 
with salt, pepper, cayenne., onion juice, celery salt, and pars- 
ley. If you like, add half the amount of oysters, parboiled 
and drained. Moisten with beaten egg and white sauce. 
Shape into rolls. Roll in fine bread crumbs, egg, and 
crumbs again, and fry in smoking hot fat. 

Oyster Croquettes. — Parboil and drain one pint of oysters. 
Cut them into quarters, and mix with cream sauce enough to 
hold them together. Season with salt and pepper. Shape,

boiled rice. Season to taste with salt and pejjper^ and 
moisten with liot thick cream sauce until soft enough to 
be handled. When cool, shape, roll in crumbs^ then in egg^ 
and again in crumbs, and fry. Calf s brains may be 
parboiled and mixed with sweetbreads or chicken for 
croquettes.

Lobster Cutlets. — Prepare the lobster as for croquettes, 
and spread it half an inch thick on a platter. Cut into 
the shape of cutlets. . Roll in crumbs, egg, and crumbs again. 
Fry in smoking hot fat. Drain, and serve with a claw to 
represent the bone. 

Salmon, or any fish croquettes or cutlets are made in 
the same way. 

Clam Croquettes. — Steam the clams. Remove the shells, 
thin skin, black end, and the dark substance from the soft 
part. Cut the "leather straps," with the scissors, into 
small bits. Mix these and the soft part with a thick cream 
sauce, season with salt and pepper, and shape into rolls. 
Roll \\\ fine bread crumbs, dip in beaten egg, then roll in 
crumbs again. Fr}' in smoking hot lard. 

Potato Croquettes. — One pint of hot mashed potatoes, one 
tablespoonful of butter, half a saltspoonful of white pepper, a 
speck of cayenne, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoon- 
fod of celery salt, a few drops of onion juice, and the yolk 
of one egg. Mix all but the Qgg, and beat until very 
light. When slightly cool, add the yolk of the Q:gg, and 
mix well. Rub through a sieve and add one teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley. Shape into smooth round balls, then into 
rolls. Roll in fine bread crumbs, then dip in heaten egg, 
then roll in crumbs again. Fr}' in smoking hot lard one 
minute. Drain and serve in the form of a pyramid.

the 03'ster plant. Shape into rolls. Roll in crumbs., dip in 
egg, and again in crumbs, and fiy as nsual. 

Prepare parsnips in the same way. 

Turkish Croquettes. — Stew half a can of tomatoes fifteen 
minutes with one slice each o^ onion, carrot, and turnip, one 
teaspoonfal of herbs, one sprig of parsley, tioo cloves, two pep- 
percorns, one teaspoonful of salt, and one saltspoonful of pep- 
per. Rub through a strainer. Take one cup of the strained 
tomatoes, one cup of brown soup stock, season highl}', and 
when boiling add ojie scant cup of uncooked rice. Cook 
till the liquor is absorbed. Add a quarter of a cup of 
butter, and steam it, or cook on the back of the stove until 
the rice is soft. Add one beaten egg and a little cream 
sauce, or thick tomato sauce, using enough to make it quite 
moist. When cool, shape into rolls. Roll in fine bread 
crumbs, then in egg, then in crumbs again, and fry in smoking 
hot fat. Sometimes it is better to parboil the rice for five 
minutes, as it is more difficult to soften it in stock than in 
clear water. 

Siceet Rice Croquettes. — Steam one scant cup of well- 
washed rice in one pint of boiling luater, or milk and water, 
thirt}" minutes, or till very soft. Add, while hot, one tea- 
spoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and the well- 
beaten yolk of one egg, and a little hot milk, if it need more 
moisture. When cool, shape into small ovals, roll in 
crumbs, dip in egg, roll in crumbs again, and fty. Or, after 
shaping, press the thumb into the centre of each, and put 
in two boiled raisins or candied cherries, or half a teaspoonful 
of jelly or marmalade. Close the rice over the centre, roll 
in crumbs, dip in egg, roll in crumbs again, and fr3^

of cinnamon. Beat together half a cup of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch, one tablespoonful of Jiour, the yolks 
of three eggs, a quarter of a cup of cold milk, and owe salt- 
spoonful of sa^^ Pour the boiling milk on the mixture, and 
stir well. Strain into the double boiler, and cook fifteen 
minutes, stirring often. Add one teaspoonful of butter and 
one teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour into a buttered bread pan 
about one inch deep, and set awa}- to cool. When very 
hard, sprinkle a bread board vfiihfine bread crumbs. Turn 
the cream out on it, and cut into strips two and a half 
inches long and one inch wide, or in squares or diamonds.

five or thu't}' minutes. Serve immediately. 

Crackers a la Oreme. — Split butter crackers, and spread 
with hutter, salt, pepper, mustard, and cheese if you like. 
Put them in a buttered pudding-dish, cover with milk, and 
bake thirty minutes. Omit the mustard, pepper, and cheese, 
prepare in the same way, and it is called Cracker Brewis. 

Sardine Canapes. — Mix the yolks of hard-boiled eggs 
with an equal amount of sardines rubbed to a paste ; season 
with lemon juice, and spread on thin slices of delicate toast. 
Put two pieces together, and cut in narrow strips. 

Turkish Pilaf. 

One cup of stewed and strained tomatoes, one cup of 
stock, seasoned highly with salt, -pepper, and minced onion. 
When boiling, add one cup of well-washed rice ; stir lightly 
with a fork until the liquor is absorbed, then add half a 
cup of butter. Set on the back of the stove or in a double 
boiler, and steam twenty minutes. Remove the cover, 
stir it lightl}', cover with a towel, and let the steam 
escape. Serve as a vegetable, or as a border for curry 
or fricassee. 

No. 2. — Prepare as in the preceding receipt. Add 
with the butter ojie cup of cooked meat (lamb, veal, or 
chicken), cut into half-inch pieces and shredded ver}' fine. 
Serve as an entree. 

Sour Milk Cheese (sometimes called Dutch, Curd, or 

Cottage Cheese). 

1 quart thick sour milk. 1 saltspoonf ul salt. 

1 teaspoonful butter. 1 tablespoonful cream. 

Place the milk in a pan on the back of the stove, and 
scald it until the curd has separated from the whey 



284 Tlie Boston Cook Book, 

Spread a strainer cloth over a bowl, pour in the milk, 
lift the edges of the cloth, and draw them together ; drain 
or wring quite drj'. There will be but half or two thirds 
of a cup of curd^ but it is worth saving. It is the flesh- 
forming or nutritive part of the milk. Put it in a small 
bowl, with the butter, salt, and cream ; mix it to a smooth 
paste with a spoon. Take a teaspoonful, and roll in the hand 
into a smooth ball. It should be quite moist, or the balls 
will crack. If too soft to handle, put it in a cool place for 
an hour, and then it will shape easilj'. Or it may be 
served without shaping, just broken up lightl}- with a 
fork. If scalded too long, the curd becomes very hard 
and brittle. It is better when freshly made, and is deli- 
cious with warm gingerbread. An excellent lunch or tea 
dish. Season this cheese with one tablespoonful of finely 
powdered sage^ if 3'ou like the flavor. 



Forefathers' Dinner. 

Succotash is the great dish in Plymouth at every cele- 
bration of Forefathers' Day, December 22. Tradition 
says it has been made in that town ever since the 
Pilgrims raised their first corn and beans, and it is 
supposed thej^ learned to make it from the Indians. 

Strangers are rather sh}' of this peculiar mixture ; but 
it is a favorite dish with the natives, and to this da}^ is 
made b}' some families many times through the winter 
season. Although the dish has never been made b}^ the 
writer, it has been tested by her in that ancient town 
many times, and the excellence of the following receipt 
is unquestionable. It is given in the name of Mrs. 
Barnabas Churchill, of Plymouth, a lady who has made 
it for fifty years after the manner handed down through 
many generations. 

One quart of large white beans (not the pea beans) ; six 
quarts of hulled corn, — the smutty white Southern corn ; 
six to eight pounds of corned beef, from the second cut of 
the rattle rand ; one pound of salt porh, fat and lean ; 



Succotash. 285 



chicken weighing from four to nx pounds ; one large 
white French turnip ; eight or ten medium-sized potatoes. 
Wash the beans, and soak over night in cold water. In 
the morning put them on in cold soft water. When boil- 
ing, change the water, and simmer until soft enough to 
mash to a pulp and the water is nearly all absorbed. 
Wash the salt pork and the corned beef, which should 
be corned onl}' three or four days. Put them on about 
eight o'clock, in cold water, in a very large kettle, and 
skim as they begin to boil. Clean, and truss the chicken 
as for boiling, and put it with the meat about an hour and 
a quarter before dinner time. Allow a longer time if a 
fowl be used, and keep plenty of water in the kettle. 
Two hours before dinner time, put the beans, mashed to 
a pulp, and the hulled corn into another kettle, with some 
of the fat from the meat in the bottom to keep them from 
sticking. Take out enough liquor from the meat to cover 
the corn and beans, and let them simmer where they will 
not burn. Stir often, and add more liquor if needed. 
The mixture should be like a thick soup, and the beans 
should absorb all the liquor, yet it must not be too 
dry. 

Pare, and cut the turnip into inch slices ; add it about 
eleven o'clock, and the potatoes (pared) half an hour 
later. Take up the chicken as soon as tender, that it 
may be served whole. Serve the beef and pork together, 
the chicken, turnip, and potatoes each on separate dishes, 
and the beans and corn in a tureen. The meat usuall}^ 
salts the mixture sufficientl}', and no other seasoning is 
necessary. Save the water left from the meat, to use in 
warming the corn and beans the next day, serving the 
meat cold. This will keep several daj's in cold weather ; 
and, like man}' other dishes, it is better the oftener it is 
warmed over, so there is no objection to making a farge 
quantit}'. The white Southern corn is considered the only 
kind suitable for this ancient dinner. 



286 The Boston Cook Booh. 



Hulled Corn. 

Tie a quart of oak wood ashes in a flannel bag, and put 
it with three gallons of cold water into an iron kettle. Let 
it boil and become 13'e, or till the water is black. -Put in 
four quarts of corn^ and boil till the hulls have all started. 
Stir it well with a wooden spoon. Then pour it into a 
large pan of cold water, and rub with the hand thoroughly 
to loosen the hulls. Change the water five or six times, 
and wash and rub till the corn is white and clean. Keep 
in cold water over night ; then put on in fresh cold water, 
and simmer four hours, or till soft and flour3^ Take off 
the hulls and scum from the water, and add fresh water 
several times during the simmering. 

Indian Meal Pudding. {Mrs. Barnabas Churchill.') 

Rub a tablespoonfid of butter round the bottom and sides 
of a smooth iron kettle, — granite or porcelain will do ; 
when melted, add half a cup of boiling ivater. This will 
prevent the milk from burning. Add one quart of milk. 
Let it boil up, and almost over the kettle ; then sift in one 
pint of Jine yellow granulated corn meal., sifting with the left 
hand, and holding the meal high, that every grain may be 
thoroughl}' scalded. Stir constant^ ; ^([^ half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and set away till cold. Then add half a pint of 
N^ew Orleans molasses and one quart of cold milk. Put into 
a well-buttered deep pudding-dish, cover with a plate, and 
bake ver}' slowlj' ten or twelve hours. Put it in a " Satur- 
da}" afternoon oven," where the fire will keep low nearlj- 
all night. Let it remain over night, and serve for a Sun- 
day breakfast. 

Chickins forc'd with Oysters. 

(^Taken from a receipt book written in 1764.) 

Take Oysters, parsley, Onions, butter, pepper, Salt, grated 
Bread, Mushrooms — if you can get y"*, & as many eggs 
as you think propper, fill them inside, & Cut 3'" on the 



Bean Porridge 287 



breast, if you have a mind to, & put some of the stuflSng 
there, make gravy of Oysters, butter & mace, pepper, 
roast them well. 



Bean Porridge. {Mrs, C. M. Poor.) 

Five pounds of corned beef^ not too salt, or four pounds 
of heef and one of salt pork ; one pint of dry white heans.four 
tablespoonfuls of corn meal., pepper and salt to taste, one pint 
of hulled corn. Soak the beans over night. In the morn- 
ing parboil in fresh water with a pinch of soda till soft. 
Put the corned beef and pork in cold water, skim carefulh', 
and simmer four or five hours, or till tender. Take out, 
and cut into two-inch pieces, and remove the bone and 
gristle ; also the fat from the liquor. Put the meat and 
beans into the meat liquor, and simmer ver}' slowly three 
or four hours, or till most of the beans are broken. Half 
an hour before serving stir in the meal, first wetting it in 
cold water to a smooth paste. The meal should thicken 
the porridge to about the consistenc}' of a thick soup. The 
meat should be cooked till it falls apart. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Add the hulled corn, and when hot 
serve with brown bread. Sometimes the vegetables usu- 
ally served with a boiled dinner are cooked with the meat, 
then removed, and the beans cooked as above, in the meat 
liquor. 

" This old-fashioned and ver}- nutritious dish was one of 
the chief articles of winter food at my grandmother's farm 
in Northern New Hampshire eight}' 3'ears ago. "When 
cooked, it was poured into bowls or basins holding from 
a pint to two quarts. A nice tow string was laid in a loop 
over the edge, and the porridge was placed where it would 
freeze. By holding the dish in hot water it would cause 
the porridge to slip out ; then it was hung up bj' the loops 
in the ' buttery,' and was considered ' best when nine 
daj'S old.' At early dawn the ' men folks ' who went into 
the forest ' chopping ' would take the skillet, or a little 
three-legged iron kettle, some large slices of ' r3'e and 



288 The Boston Cook Book. 

Indian' bread in their pockets to keep it from freezing. 
The porridge was hung, wrapped in a clean towel, upon 
the sled stakes. Their spoons were made of wood. The 
hay that la}' on the floor of the ox sled was of use to keep 
their feet warm, and given to the oxen for 'bait' at noon. 
When it was twelve o'clock ' by the sun,' they kindled a 
fire b}" the aid of a ' tinder box,' warmed their porridge, 
and with their brown bread enjoj'ed this strong food as no 
modern epicure can his costly French dishes." 

Smothered Chicken. {Adaline Miller.) 

Clean a chicken, too old for broiling ; split down the 
back, and put it breast upwards in a shallow pan ; pour 
over it one cup of hoilmg loater^ and cover tightl}' to keep 
in the steam. Cook half an hour ; then baste with the hot 
water, rub all over with softened butter^ and dredge with 
salt and pepper. Baste often, keep closely covered, and 
cook till tender. It should be yellow, not dark brown. 
Thicken the gravy ; add chopped parsley^ salt, and j^^P- 
per^ and pour it over the chicken. 

Steamed Apple and Indian Meal Pudding. (J^Irs. Faunce.) 

Scald two cups of corn meal with boiling water. Add 
one teaspoonful of salt., one fourth of a cup of molasses., 
and two tart apples cut into eighths and cored, but not 
pared. Dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda in warm 
water, and add to the meal. Add more warm water to 
make a batter thin enough to pour. Pour into a grea^sed 
pail, place it on a trivet in a kettle of boiling water, 
t^ook three hours. The water must not stop boiling. To 
be eaten with roast meat. The next day warm what is 
left in the meat gravy. 



Botany of Food. 289 



VEG-ETABLES. 

Vegetable food, in its widest sense, includes some part 
of every form of plant growth, — herb, shrub, or tree, — 
used either as vegetables, fruits, grains, condiments, or 
beverages. Vegetables, as the term is generall}^ used, are 
such plants as are cultivated for culinar\' purposes. They 
comprise a variety of the parts of the plant, — roots, 
stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit. 

Before studying vegetables proper, it may be interesting 
for those who have never considered food from a botan- 
ical point of A'iew to glance at the various forms of veg- 
etable growth commonly used as food. 

Beginning with roots ^ we find, among fleshy roots, the 
carrot, turnip, parsnip, beet, salsifj', and radish, which are 
cooked in their natural state or used raw. Also from 
roots we get ginger, arrowroot, and tapioca. Bootstocks, or 
stems growing underground, consist of tubers, like the 
potato, 3'am, and artichoke, and of scalv bulbs, like the onion, 
chives, leek, and garlic. Stons we eat in asparagus ; and 
whole trunks of trees are felled and used in making sago, 
which is the pith of a species of palm-tree. 

Leaves include lettuce, endive, spinach, parsley, cabbage, 
and greens of various kinds. Dried leaves and Jlowers are 
used in the form of tea, sage, thyme, bay leaves, tobacco, 
marjoram, savor3^ and other herbs. Leaf stalks include 
celery and rhubarb ; flower stalks, cauliflower and globe arti- 
chokes. The juices of vegetables furnish many forms of 
food, — sugar, acids, honey, oil, gum, and wines. The 
bark we use in cinnamon. Unexpanded flower-buds are 
pickled, as in capers, or dried, as in cloves. Ripe cloves 
have no aroma. 

Many seeds or berries are gathered green, and are then 
dried for use. Allspice, or Jamaica pepper cassia buds, 

19 



290 The Boston Cook Book. 

long peppers, and black pepper are of this class. Mustard 
and celer}' seeds are used as well as the leaves. Nutmegs 
are seeds ; and mace is the aril, or covering, of the nutmeg. 
Seed vessels are used green, as in string beans, and also dried 
and ground, as in caj^enne pepper. Farinaceous seeds or 
grains include wheat, r3^e, oats, corn, barle}^, rice, and buck- 
wheat. The}^ have a thin seed vessel adhering closety to 
the whole surface of the seed. Oleaginous seeds contain 
oil and starch, like the cocoanut, walnut, chestnut, almond, 
etc. Leguminous seeds are enclosed in pods, as peas, beans, 
lentils, etc. 

Under the general name of fruit we eat very different 
things. Fleshy fruits, like grapes, tomatoes, gooseberries, 
blueberries, cranberries, and currants, are pidpy seed vessels. 
Oranges and lemons are pulpy seed vessels, with a thick 
leathery rind. Squashes, melon, cucumbers, egg-plant, etc., 
are fleshy fruits with a hard rind. Chocolate is made 
from the seed of ix. fleshy fruit. In checkerberries, quinces, 
and in all parts of the apple and pear but the core, we eat 
Si fleshy, enlarged calyx. In peaches, plums, apricots, cher- 
ries, and other stone fruits, we eat the outer part of a peri- 
carp or seed vessel. Olives belong to this class, and are 
used green and in the form of oil expressed from the 
fleshy pericarp. Coffee is the seed of a stone fruit. In 
figs we eat a hollow flower stalk, grown pulp}', and the 
inside lined with a great number of flowers. Mulberries 
are clusters of the pulpy flower leaves and stalk of minute 
multiple flowers. Pineapples are mulberries on a large 
scale. The strawberry is the receptacle of a flower grown 
juicy and pulp}', and bearing many one-seeded seed vessels 
on its surface. Blackberries also are receptacles, though 
smaller, covered with clusters of little stone fruits. Rasp- 
berries are the little stone fmiits in a cluster without the 
receptacle. 

Many fruits, when dried, are called by different names. 
Dried currants are small grapes. Sultanas are larger 
grapes, and raisins are another and larger variety of the 
same fruit. Prunes and prunellas are dried plums. 



Vegetables. 291 



Some of the lower orders of vegetation afford valuable 
food. Irish and Ceylon mosses are seaweeds. Iceland 
moss is a lichen. Truffles and mushrooms are a species of 
fungi of vegetable growth, but possessing a strong meaty 
or animal flavor. 

"We need a large variet}' of vegetables in our food to 
promote perfect health. Vegetables are rich in saline 
substances which counteract the evil effect of too much 
animal food. Some are rich in organic acids, and many 
abound in indigestible ligneous tissues which are useful 
in certain conditions. Those which contain starch and 
albumen and which can be stored for use during the winter 
months are considered the most valuable. All vegetables 
need the addition of salt and butter, or some form of fat, 
and many are rendered less indigestible b}' seasoning with 
pepper. Peas, beans, squashes, beets, turnips, etc., which 
contain sugar, should be slightly sweetened, as much of 
the natural sweetness is lost in cooking ; and those con- 
taining potash salts, as cabbage and lettuce, need an acid 
condiment. Beans, peas, and other vegetables, which are 
difficult of digestion, are less indigestible if eaten in the 
form of purees. 

Green vegetables should be freshly gathered, thoroughly 
washed in cold water, and cooked in freshly boiling 
salted water. It is impossible to give a definite time 
for cooking, as much depends upon their age and the time 
they have been gathered. Wilted vegetables require a 
much longer time than fresh. All vegetables should be 
cooked until soft and tender, and no longer. This is 
better ascertained by watching them carefully and piercing 
with a fork than b}" depending upon any time-table. Veg- 
etables which are eaten raw and are liable to ferment in 
the stomach are usually dressed with some condiment, — 
oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. 

Every green vegetable keeps its color better if it be 
boiled rapidly and uncovered. Many use soda for the 
same purpose, but unwisely. 



292 The Boston Cook Book, 



Potatoes. 

The potato is more generally used than an}^ other veg- 
etable. It combines with other foods — meats particularly 
— to give the desired elements. But it should not be used 
alone, or in too great a proportion, as it gives very little 
flesh-forming material. When taken exclusiveh', such a 
large bulk of it is required for sustenance that it results 
in increased size and prominence of the stomach, which 
sometimes amounts to deformit}'. 

Potatoes are three fourths water. The solid matter 
consists largel}' of starch, with a small quantity of albumen 
and mineral matter held in solution in the juices. The 
quantity of starch increases during the autumn, and remains 
stationary during the winter. In spring, when germination 
commences, the starch is changed to gum, and renders 
the potatoes mucilaginous. The sugar formed from this 
gum renders them sweeter. Potatoes which have been 
frozen and thawed suddenly" are sweeter and more watery 
than before, because on exposure to the warmth and air 
the starch is changed to sugar. Thej' should be kept 
frozen until read}^ to use, or used immediately after thaw- 
ing in cold water. The sprouts on potatoes should be 
removed as soon as the}^ appear, since, if the}' are allowed 
to grow, the}' exhaust the starch, and render the potatoes 
unfit for food. Potatoes should be kept in a dry, cool 
cellar. 

Botanicall}^ potatoes belong to the same poisonous 
order as tobacco and deadl}^ nightshade, and contain an 
acid juice which is unpleasant to the taste and often 
renders them indigestible. This lies in and near the rind 
of the potato. It is drawn out by heat. When the 
potatoes are l)aked it escapes in the steam, if the}' are 
opened at once ; and when they are boiled, it is absorbed 
by the water. It is not wasteful, therefore, to peel pota- 
toes before cooking, or to take oflT quite a thick peel, as 
they are thus rendered more wholesome. Taste the water 
in which potatoes have been boiled, and you will have no 



Potatoes, 293 



desire to use it in yonv 3-east, bread, or stews. Potatoes 
when first peeled are white, but turn brown on exposure 
to the air. For this reason the}' should be covered with 
cold water as soon as peeled. New potatoes are watery, 
as the starch is not fully formed. They have a very thin 
skin, which may be rubbed or scraped off. 

Raw potatoes which are to be fried should be thinly 
sliced, and soaked in cold water to draw out all the starch, 
that the}' maj' be crisp and not meal}'. The cells which 
hold the starch grains are of an albuminous nature. 
These cells are divided in slicing the potatoes, and the 
starch is drawn out into the water ; the albuminous mem- 
brane hardens in frying, and makes the potatoes crisp. 

Boiled potatoes should be drained tlie moment the heat 
bursts all the starch grains, whicli may easily be determined 
by their soft texture when pierced with a fork, else the 
starch will absorb water, and the potatoes become pasty 
and unwholesome. 

Baked potatoes should be served as soon as soft, and 
the skin should be slightly ruptured by squeezing to let 
the steam within escape, else it will condense and make 
the potato watery and unwholesome. Potatoes which are 
cut or sliced for stews and chowders should be soaked 
and scalded to remove the greenness before adding them 
to the stew. 

Boiled Potatoes. — Select potatoes of uniform size. 
Wash and scrub with a brush. Pare, and soak in cold 
water. Put them in boiling salted water, — one quart 
of water and one tablespoonful of salt for six large potatoes. 
Cook half an hour or until soft, but not until broken. 
Drain off every drop of the water. Place the kettle un- 
covered on the back of the stove to let the steam escape. 
Keep hot until ready to serve. 

Potatoes a la Neige. — Prepare the potatoes as above, 
and when well drained and mealy beat them thoroughly 
with a fork, add salt to taste, and sers^e at once, piled 
lightly on the dish. 

Rice Potato. — Rub the beaten potato through a squash 



294 The Boston Cook Book. 

strainer into the dish in which it is to be served. Keep 
the dish in a pan of hot water, and use a potato masher 
or pestle to facihtate the rubbing. Mashed and riced 
potatoes may be browned by placing the dish in the oven 
a few minutes. 

Mashed Potatoes. — To o?ie pint of hot boiled potatoes, 
add one tahlespoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a saltspoonful of pepper, and hot milk or cream to 
moisten. Mash in the keftle in which they were boiled, 
and beat with a fork until light and creamy, and turn out 
lightly on a dish. Never smooth it over, as that will make 
it heav}^ and compact. 

Potato Balls. — One pint of hot mashed potatoes higlily 
seasoned with salt, pepper, celery salt, chopped parsley, and 
butter ; moisten, if needed, with a little hot milk or cream. 
Beat one egg light, and add part of it to the potatoes. 
Shape into smooth round balls. Brush over with the re- 
mainder of the egg, and bake on a buttered tin until 
brown. Be careful not to get them too moist. 

Potato Puff. — Prepare as for potato balls, making iu 
quite moist with cream or milk. Beat the yolks and white* 
of two eggs separately, and stir them into the potatoes 
when slightly cooled. Turn into a shallow baking-dish,, 
pile it in a rocky form, and bake ten minutes, or until it is 
puffed and browned. Add half a cup of finely chopped 
cooked meat, to give a variet3^ 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. — Cut one pint of cold boiled potatoes 
into dice, and season with salt and pepper. Fry one scant 
tablespoonful of minced onion in one heaping tahlespoonful of 
butter, until yellow. Add the potatoes, and stir with a 
fork until they have absorbed all the butter, being careful 
not to break them. Add one tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, and serve hot. One tablespoonftd of vinegar 
heated with the butter gives the potatoes a nice flavor. 

Creamed Potatoes. — Cut cold boiled potatoes into cubes 
measuring one third of an inch, or into thin slices. Put 
them in a small shallow pan, cover with milk, and cook 
until the potatoes have absorbed nearly all the milk. To 



Potatoes, 295 



one pint of potatoes add one tahlespoonful of butter^ half a 
teaspoonful of salt^ half a saltspoonful of pepper^ and a little 
chopped parsley. 

Fried Potatoes. — Cut cold boiled potatoes into slices 
about a quarter of an inch thick. Have a fiying-pan hot 
and well greased with salt pork or bacon fat. Cook the 
potatoes in the fat until brown, then turn, and brown the 
other side. 

French Potatoes. — Yvy as above, pour a white sauce on 
a platter, and arrange the fried potatoes on the sauce. 

Potatoes a la Maitre d' Hotel. — Prepare the Maitre 
d^Hotel butter ; mix one tablespoonful of butter^ creamed, with 
the whole yolk of one egg. Add one teaspoonful of lemon juice ^ 
one tablespoonful of chopped parsley., half a teaspoonful of salt.^ 
and half a saltspoonful ot pepper. Cut one pint of cold boiled 
potatoes in thin slices or dice, or cut raw potatoes into 
balls with a French cutter, and boil them ten minutes. 
Warm the potatoes in milk enough to barelj' cover them. 
When the milk is nearl}' absorbed, stir in quicklj' the 
Maitre d'Hotel butter, and serve at once. 

Baked Potatoes. '-^ Select smooth potatoes of uniform 
size. Wash, and scrub well. Bake in a hot oven about 
fort^^-five minutes, or until soft. Pinch them to break the 
skins, and let the steam escape. Serve at once, and 
never cover, as the steam causes them to become sogg}-. 

Franconia Potatoes {Baked with Meat) . — Wash, scrub, 
and pare potatoes of uniform size. Put them in the drip- 
ping-pan with the meat, and baste when the meat is 
basted. Or place them in a small tin pan beside the 
meat or on the grate, and baste with the dripping. 

Potatoes in the Half- Shell., or Souffle. — Wash, scrub, 
and bake three smooth potatoes. Cut in halves lengthwise, 
and without breaking the skin scoop out the potato into a 
hot bowl. Mash, and add one even tablespoonful of butter., 
one of hot milk, and salt and pepper to taste. Beat the whites 
of two eggs stiff, and mix it with the potato. Fill the skins 
with the potato mixture, heaping it lightl}' on the top. 
Brown slight!}'. 




296 The Boston Cook Book. 

Stuffed Potatoes. — Bake potatoes of equal size ; when 
done, and still hot, cut off a small piece from the end of 
each potato. Scoop out the inside. Mash, and mix with 

it half the quantity of cooked 
meat^ highly seasoned and 
finely chopped. Fill the 
skins a little above the 
edge. Set in the oven to 
brown the tops. Or omit 
Fig. 39. Stuffed Potatoes. the meat, and fill Only with 

the mashed and seasoned 
potato. Replace the cover, and heat again. 

Fried Raw Potatoes. — Pare, wash, and cut into the de- 
su'ed shape. Soak in cold salted water, drain, and dry 
between towels. Fr}' in clear fat, hot enough to brown 
while counting sixt}'. Drain, and sprinkle with salt. 

Saratoga Potatoes are shaved in thin slices. Parisienne 
Potatoes are cut in small balls with a French vegetable 
cutter. Macaroni., or Shoo Fly., Potatoes are cut in quarter- 
inch slices, then in quarter-inch strips. Crescents and 
other shapes ma}^ be cut with vegetable cutters. 

These are all to be fried ; but some prefer to boil the 
Parisienne potatoes, and serve in a cream sauce., flavored 
with j^ctrsley. 

Sweet Potatoes may be baked or boiled. The}' are better 
baked. Cold sweet potatoes ma}' be cut in slices, warmed 
in milk^ and seasoned with butter and saU., or browned in 
butter. 

A Southern Dish. {Adaline Miller.) — Cut cold baked 
sweet potatoes into quarter-inch slices, and put them in an 
earthen dish. Spread each layer with hutter^ and sprinkle 
slightly with sugar, and bake until hot and slightly browned. 
Sweet potatoes are much richer when twice cooked. 

Spinach. 

Pick over, trim off" the roots and decayed leaves ; wash 
thoroughly, lifting the spinach from one pan of water into 
another, that the sand may be left in the water, and 



Greens. 297 



changing the water until it is clear. Put the spinach in a 
large kettle without water. Place it on the stove where it 
will cook slowl}^ until the juice is drawn out, then boil 
until tender. Drain and chop fine. For half a peck of 
spinach add one large tahlespoonful of butter, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a quarter of a saltspoonful of pepper ; 
or add a little thin cream sauce. Heat again and serve on 
toast. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs and toast points, or 
serve cold with French dressing. 

Spinach is nearl}' all water, and a smaller portion of the 
potash salts — its most valuable constituent — is lost when 
it is cooked in its own juices. 

Greens. 

The leaves and stalks of 3'oung beets, milkweed, dande- 
lions, and narrow dock are useful as food in the early 
spring, chiefl}' for the water and alkaline salts which they 
contain. The}' should be picked over, and washed care- 
full}', cooked in boiling salted water until tender, then 
drained, and seasoned with butter and salt. Vinegar is 
often used with them as a desirable condiment. Man}- 
people consider it necessary to boil a piece of salt pork with 
greens, but they are more wholesome when seasoned with 
butter. Dandelions should be cooked in plent}' of water ; 
but other tender greens may be cooked, like spinach, in 
their own juices. 

Asparagus. 

\Yash carefully and break (not cut) into inch pieces 
as far as each stalk can be broken. "When it will not snap 
off quickly, the stalk is too tough to be used. Cook in 
boiling salted water, deep enough to cover, for fifteen min- 
utes, or until tender. When the asparagus is not fresh 
and tender, it is well to boil the hardest part first, and add 
the tender heads after ten minutes. Drain, season with 
butter and salt, or pour white sauce over it, and serve on 
toast. Man}' people prefer to leave the stalks whole, and 
tie them into bundles before boiling. When served in this 
way, unless all the tough part be broken off before cook- 



298 The Boston Cook Book, 

iug, it is inconvenient, if not impossible, to cut the stalk 

afterward. 

Green Peas. 

Peas are fresh when the pods are green, crisp, and 
plump. The fresh pods are sweet, and full of flavor. 
Wash the pods before shelling, then the peas will require 
no washing. Put the peas into a colander, and sift out 
the fine particles. Boil the pods ten minutes, skim them 
out, and add the peas. Boil fifteen minutes, or till tender. 
When nearl}' done, add the salt. Let the water boil nearly 
awa}', and serve without draining, except when the peas 
are to be served as a garnish. Season with butter^ cream, 
salt., and a little sugar. 

Old peas should be cooked until tender, drained, mashed, 
and rubbed through a sieve, and served as a vegetable or 
made into a puree. 

Peas are nutritious, but they are indigestible unless the 
hull be broken before thej' are swallowed. 

Beans. 

Strmg Beans. — Remove the strings. The surest way 
to do that is to pare a thin strip from each edge of the pods. 
Man}' persons think this unnecessary ; but the beans are 
much more delicate, and two or three strings are enough 
to spoil the whole dish. La}' a handful of the pods on a 
board with the ends even, and cut them all at once into 
inch pieces. Wash, and cook in boiling salted water from 
one to three hours, the time varying with different vari- 
eties of beans. Drain ; season with butter, salt, and cream, 
and serve hot, or serve cold as a salad. When ver}' young 
and tender, the}' may be cooked in just water enough to 
keep them from burning. 

Shelled Beans. — Wash, and cook in boiling water ; al- 
ways use soft water. Add salt after ten minutes, and boil 
until tender. Let the water boil nearly away, and serve 
without draining. Season with butter and salt. Lima 
beans and other white varieties are improved by adding 
a little hot cream. 



Corn. 299 



Green or Sweet Com. 

Remove the husk, and ever}^ thread of the silk}' fibre. 
Put into boihug water, cover with the clean inner husks, 
and cook from five to fifteen minutes. Try a kernel, and 
take up the corn as soon as the milk has thickened and 
the raw taste is destroj'ed. Corn, if boiled a long time, is 
made hard and its flavor impaired. 

Green Corn Fritters^ or 3Iock Oysters. — Cut through 
each row of kernels with the point of a sharp knife. Then 
with the back of the knife press out the pulp, and leave 
the hull on the cob. This is better and easier than to 
shave or gTate ofl* the kernels. To OJie pint of corn pulp 
add two loell-beaten eggs^ half a teaspoonful of salt^ half 
a saltspoonful of pepper., and two tahlespjoonfuls of flour., 
or just enough to keep the corn and egg together. Do 
not add milk, as then more flour will be required, and this 
destro^-s the flavor of the corn. Fry in small cakes on a 
buttered griddle, and brown well on each side ; or add 
more flour, and drop by spoonfuls into deep fat. When 
highly seasoned with salt and pepper^ these fritters have 
the flavor of 03'sters. Make in the same way with canned 
com, finely chopped. Add two tablespoonfuls of milk^ as 
the canned corn is less moist than the fresh. 

Succotash. — This may be made by mixing equal quan- 
tities of shelled beans and corn cut from the cob, having 
first cooked and seasoned them separately. Or cut the 
raw corn from the cob, by scoring each row and pressing 
the pulp out with the back of the knife, leaving the hulls 
on the cob, and when the beans are nearly soft, add the 
corn, and cook fifteen minutes. Add cream, butter, salt, 
and sugar to taste. 

In winter, when the vegetables are dr}' and hard, soak 
the corn and Lima beans over night. Put the beans on 
in cold water, changing it twice. As soon as it boils, add 
the corn, and cook slowl}' several hours, or till soft. Sea- 
son with butter, sugar, and salt. Canned Lima beans and 
canned corn are also used. 



300 The Boston Cook Book, 

Corn, beans, and peas are delicious and wholesome sum- 
mer vegetables. Much of the prejudice against their use 
among children results from imperfect mastication, which 
renders them indigestible. Ever}' row of kernels should 
be cut with a sharp knife if the corn be served on the 
cob, and every pea or bean should be mashed with a fork 
to insure their perfect digestion. Thus eaten, these vege- 
tables are valuable food, and will cause no trouble. 

Tomatoes. 

Eaio Tomatoes. — Scald and peel at least an hour be- 
fore using. Keep them on the ice, and serve with sugar ^ 
salt^ vinegar^ or with Mayonnaise dressing. If very 
large, the}' ma}- be sliced before serving. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water over them, 
remove the skins and the hard green stem. Cut them 
into quarters, and stew in a granite pan fifteen minutes, 
until the pulp is soft and the juice is partly boiled away. 
Add salt^ pepper^ butter^ and sugar if desired. The 
tomato ma}^ be thickened with cracker crumbs or with 
cornstarch wet in a little cold water. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. — Season one quart of tomatoes 
with one teaspoonfid of salt., one saltspoonful of pepper^ 
half a cup of sugar ^ and a few drops of onion juice. 
Butter a deep dish, and sprinkle with^ne crumbs. Pour 
in the tomatoes. Moisten one cup of cracker crumbs with 
half a cup of melted butter. Spread over the top, and 
brown in the oven. Raw tomatoes sliced may be used in 
layers, alternating with crumbs and seasoning. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. — Cut a thin slice from the stem end 
of large, smooth tomatoes. Remove the seeds and soft 
pulp, and mix with the pulp an equal amount of buttered 
cracker crumbs. Season to taste with salt^ pepper., sugar, 
and onion juice. Fill the cavit}' with the mixture, heap- 
ing it in the centre, and sprinkle buttered crumbs over the 
top. Place the tomatoes in a granite pan, and bake until 
^he crumbs are brown. Take them up carefull}' with a 



Onions. 301 



broad knife, and serve very hot. A small quantity of 
cooked meat finelj' chopped maj' be used with the 
crumbs. 

Onions. 

Pour boiling water over them, and remove the skins. 
Put them in boihng salted water. When the}' have 
boiled five minutes, change the water, and change again 
after ten minutes. Boil half an hour, or until tender, but 
not until broken. Drain off the water, add milk enough 
to cover, and cook five or ten minutes longer. Season 
with butter^ salt^ and ^:/e/)/:>e?*. Serve plain or as a garnish 
for beef. Or omit the seasoning, and pour ichlte sauce 
over them. 

Baked or Scalloped Onions. — Boil, and if large cut 
into quarters. Put into a shallow dish, cover with ichite 
sauce and buttered crumbs^ and bake until the crumbs are 
brown. 

Onions are rich in flesh-forming elements, are soothing 
to the mucous membrane, and are otherwise medicinal. 
They impart an agreeable flavor to many kinds of food. 

Cauliflower. 

The leaves should be green and fresh, and the heads 
creamy white. When there are dark spots, the cauliflower 
is wilted. Pick off the outside leaves, soak in cold salted 
water, top downwards, for one hour, to cleanse it thor- 
oughlj'. Tie it in a twine bag, to prevent breaking. Cook 
in boiling salted water fifteen or twentj' minutes, or until 
tender. If not boiled in a bag, remove the scum before 
it settles on the cauliflower. Serve in a shallow dish, and 
cover with a cream or Hollandaise sauce. Or add a little 
grated cheese., and cover with cracker crumbs moistened 
in melted butter., and bake until the crumbs are brown. 
Or when cold, serve as a salad ^ith. Mayonnaise dressing. 
Cauliflower may be cut in small pieces, and served as a 
garnish around broiled chicken or sweetbreads. 



302 The Boston Cook Book, 



Cabbage. 

Select a small heavj' cabbage. Remove the outside 
leaves, cut into quarters, cut off the tough stalk, soak in 
cold salted water half an hour. Cook till tender in boil- 
ing salted water, changing the water twice. Drain, cut 
or chop fine, season with salt and butter^ or cover, with 
white sauce and buttered crumbs^ and bake till the crumbs 
are brown. 

The cauliflower and cabbage contain more gluten, and 
are therefore more nutritious, than any other vegetable 
food. Thej' should be eaten with fat and oil}' food, and 
require an acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, as a condi- 
ment. Cabbage is considered indigestible, and man}' boil 
with it a small piece of red pepper to counteract this 
• effect. If the water in which cabbage is boiled be changed 
two or three times, less of the strong odor and flavor is 
retained. With proper treatment this A-egetable may be 
served as temptingly as an}' other. It is more wholesome 
when served in its raw state as a salad than when cooked. 

Celery. 

Scrape clean, and cut the stalks into inch pieces ; cook 
in boiling salted water half an hour, or until tender. 
Drain and mix with a lohite sauce ; or dip them in fritter 
batter^ and fry in hot/a^. Celery is usually eaten raw, as 
a salad, but is more digestible when cooked. Celery is 
particularly good for nervous or rheumatic people. 

Egg Plant. 

Cut the plant into slices one third of an inch thick, with- 
out removing the skin. vSprinkle salt over each slice, pile 
them, and cover with a weight to press out the juice. Drain, 
and dip each slice first 'vc\.jine crumbs^ then in beaten egg^ 
and again in crumbs^ and saute them in hot fat. Egg 
plants belong to the same family as the potato and tobacco, 
all of which contain a bitter juice, more or less poisonous. 



Mushrooms. 303 



Egg Plant Fritters. {Adaline Miller.) — Put the egg 
plant whole into boiling salted water, mixed with one 
tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon juice / cook twenty 
minutes or until tender ; mash and drain. To one pint of 
egg plant add half a cup of flour, tico eggs, well beaten, 
and salt and pepper to taste. Frj- in small cakes in hot 
fat, browning well on both sides. 

Artichokes. 

The Jerusalem Articlioke is a tuber, something like the 
potato ; but as it contains no starch, it is not mealj'. Peel 
and throw at once into cold water and vinegar to preserve 
the color. Cook in boiling salted water until tender, watch 
closely, and take them out as thej^ become soft, for if left 
in longer they will harden again. Serve with a white sauce. 
Jerusalem artichokes ma}' be used as a salad, or they ma}' 
be pickled. 

Glohe Artichokes. — These are thick, fleshy-petalled 
flowers which grow on a plant that resembles the thistle. 
The thickened receptacle and scales of the involucre form 
the edible portion. Soak the artichokes, cut off the out- 
side leaves, trim away the lower leaves and the ends of 
the others. Cook in boiling salted water, with the tops 
downward, half an hour, or until the leaves can be drawn 
out. Drain, remove the choke, and serve with dravm 
butter. 

Mushrooms. 

Peel the top and stalk, break in small pieces, place 
them in a stewpan, sprinkle slightly with salt and pepper, 
and let them stand half an hour, until the juice is drawn 
out. Stew the mushrooms in the juice and a little butter 
until tender, add crecwi to cover, and when the cream is 
hot serve on toast. Mushrooms are considered difficult of 
digestion. They are a fungous gi'owth, and have a woody 
odor and a meaty flavor. They are used largely in sauces. 
Unless familiar with the difference between the edible and 
the poisonous mushrooms, it is safer to use the canned 
mushrooms, or to obtain the fresh at a reliable market. 



304 The Boston Cook Book. 

The eatable mushroom first appears ver3^ small, and of 
a round button shape, on a short underground stalk. At 
this stage it is all white. It grows rapidly, and soon the 
skin breaks around the base of the button, which there 
spreads like an umbrella, and shows underneath a fringed 
fur of a fine salmon-color, which changes to a chocolate 
and then to a dark brown color, when the mushrooms have 
attained some size. The}' are in perfection before the last 
change. The skin should peel easily-. Those with yellow 
or white fur, and which grow in low, damp shady places, 
should be avoided. The good mushrooms spring up in 
open sunny fields in August and September. Do not trust 
to any written description, but search the fields with some 
one who can unerringly distinguish them. 

The common puff-ball, when white and hard, though not 
so delicate as the mushroom, makes a palatable dish. It 
should be peeled with a silver knife, cut in slices half an 
inch thick, dipped in crumbs and egg^ or in a batter, and 
fried. Serve at once. 

Winter Squash. 

If the shell be soft, pare the squash, remove the seeds, 
and steam or cook in boiling salted water. If the shell be 
hard, split the squash, remove the seeds, and steam or 
boil until soft. Scrape out the soft part from the shell, 
mash, and season to taste. A pint of squash needs one 
tablespoonful of butter, a feio grains of pepper, half 
a teaspoonful of sugar, and salt to taste. Squash 
may be baked in the shell, then mashed, and seasoned as 
above. 

Summer Squashes are good onty when 3'oung, fresh, 
and tender. Wash, and cut into quarters or small pieces. 
The skin and seeds need not be removed. Cook in boiling 
salted water twenty minutes, or until tender. Place the 
squash in a strainer cloth, mash it thoroughly, squeeze the 
cloth until the squasn is dr}-. Add a little cream or butter, 
salt and 2^epper, and heat again before serving. 



Parsnips. 305 



Carrots and Turnips. 

Carrots and turnips contain, instead of starch, a gelati- 
nous gummy substance, called pectine. The}^ are useful 
in soups, giving them a fine flavor and color. Soups in 
which carrots are used are gelatinous when cold. Carrots 
are not a favorite vegetable for the table ; but if 3'oung 
and tender, the}' are palatable when boiled, and served in 
a white sauce. They should be washed and scraped (not 
pared) before boiling. Old carrots are sometimes boiled, 
and served with corned beef and salt fish. Their rich 
color makes them effective as a garnish. The red, outside 
part is considered the best, as the inside is stringy. 

Turnips contain but little nutriment. They are very 
watery, and having no starch are agreeable food to be 
eaten with potatoes. They contain no salt, and therefore 
need more than other vegetables. Being wholly deficient 
in starch and fat, they are good with fat meat, corned beef, 
roast pork, and mutton. 

Turnips in White Sauce. — Wash and cut French tur- 
nips into half or three-quarter inch slices ; pare and cut 
each slice into strips, and then into cubes. Boil in boiling 
salted water until tender. Drain and pour white sauce 
over them. Turnips ma}^ also be mashed, drained, and 
seasoned with butter^ pepper., and salt. 

Parsnips. 

Parsnips contain starch and sugar, a small portion of 
gluten, and less water than carrots or turnips. They are 
eaten with salt fish and corned beef. Those which have 
remained in the ground through the winter are considered 
the best. The}^ should be washed and scrubbed thor- 
oughh', but are more easil}' peeled after boiling. Cut 
them into half-inch cubes, and serve in ichite sauce. 

Parsnip Fritters. — After boiling the parsnips, plunge 

them into cold water and the skins will sHp off easily', 

mash them,^ and season to taste with butter, salt, and 

pepper. Flour the hands, and shape the mashed parsnip 

i Parsnips are more digestible if mashed and rubbed through a pur^e 
sieve to remove the woody fibre. 



3o6 The Boston Cook Booh, 

into small, flat oval cakes. Roll them in flour, and fry 
them in butter until brown ; or dip them in molasses^ and 
^hen fiy. 

Salsify, or Oyster Plant. 

Scrape, and throw at once into cold water, with a little 
vinegar in it to keep them from turning black. Cook in 
boiling salted water one hour, or until tender. Drain, 
mash, and season, and fvy like parsnip fritters ; or cut 
into inch lengths, and mix with a tchite sauce; or dip the 
pieces in fritte?' batter, and fry in hot /at. 

Beets. 

Wash, but do not cut them, as that destro^'s the sweet- 
ness and color. Cook in boiling w^ater until tender. Young 
beets will cook in one hour, old beets require a longer 
time ; and if tough, wilted, or stringy, the}' will never boil 
tender. When cooked, put them in a pan of cold water, 
and rub off" the skin. Young beets are cut in slices, and 
served hot with butter, salt, and i^epper, or cut in small 
cubes and served in a white sauce. Th^y are often pickled 
in vinegar, spiced or plain, and served cold ; or they may 
be cut into dice, and mixed with other vegetables for a 
salad. 

Rice. 

Rice should be thoroughl}- washed. Turn the rice into 
a coarse strainer, and place the strainer in a deep dish of 
cold water. Rub the rice, and .lift it in the strainer out of 
the water, changing the water till it is clear. It is impor- 
tant to observe all the steps of this process, for in this 
way all the grit is deposited in the water, leaving the rice 
thoroughly cleansed. Drain, and cook in either of the 
following wa3's, each of which, if followed carefully, will 
insure white, distinct kernels of thoroughly cooked rice. 

Boiled Bice. — Have tioo quarts o^ water with one table- 
spoonful of salt boiling rapidly in an uncovered kettle. 
Throw in one cup of well-xoashed rice, and let it boil so 
fast that the kernels fairl}' dance in the water. Skim care- 



Riee. 307 

fully, and stir with a fork, never with a spoon, as that 
mashes the kernels. Cook twelve, fifteen, or twenty' min- 
utes, according to the age of the rice, and add more boiling 
water if needed. Test the grains often, and the moment 
they are soft, and before the starch begins to dissolve and 
cloud the water, pour into a squash strainer. Drain, and 
place the rice — still in the strainer — in a pan in the hot 
closet or on the back of the stove. Stir it before serving, 
to let the steam escape and the kernels become ^vy. Be 
careful not to cook the rice enough to burst the grains, 
as then nothing can prevent them from sticking together. 

Steamed Rice. — Pour two cups of hoiling water on one 
cup of well-washed rice ; add half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Cook in the double boiler thirty minutes, or till soft. Re- 
move the cover, stir with a fork to let the steam escape, 
and dry off the rice. Rice will usually absorb twice its 
bulk of water ; but when cooked in milk or stock a little 
more moisture will be required. 

Some of the nitrogenous and mineral constituents, of 
wLich rice has but a small amount, are lost in the boiling 
water, and unless the water be used for soup, to boil rice 
is a wasteful process. Steaming is a much easier method, 
and is more economical. Many dishes may be prepared 
from combinations of rice and various seasoning materials. 

Savory Rice. — Steam one scant cup of rice and two 
cups of rich white or brown stock highly seasoned with 
salt, cayenne., chopped parsley., and ground herbs. Stir 
in one tablespoonful of butter with a fork, just before 
serving. 

No. 2. — Fr}^ one tablespoonful of chopped onion in 
one heaping tablespoon fid of butter until jellow ; add 
one scant cup of uncooked rice, and stir until slightly 
colored ; then add one pint of chicken stock, and pour 
all into the double boiler, and steam thirtj^ minutes. 

Salmon Rice. — Use half stock and half strained toma- 
toes ; season highly with curry, and cook like Savor^^Rice. 

Rice icith Cheese. — Steam the rice after either of the 
preceding receipts, and put it in a shallow dish in layers, 



3o8 Tlie Boston Cook Booh 

alternating with grated cheese and tomato sauce ^ or with 
slices of hard-boiled eggs and thin cream sauce. Heat in 
the oven with or without a crust of buttered crumbs. 

Macaroni, Spaghetti, and Vermicelli. 

These are thick pastes made from wheaten flour mixed 
with a small quantit}' of water. The}' are made to take 
various shapes by being forced through holes in metallic 
plates. These plates are arranged over a fire ; and the 
macaroni, as it issues from the holes, is partialh' baked, 
and afterward hung to dry over rods. Vermicelli is used 
in soup and puddings ; macaroni and spaghetti as vege- 
tables. 

Macaroni is a nutritious and economical food, and should 
be used more extensiveh' than it is. Do not wash it, as 
the boiling water will better take off anything that needs 
to be removed. Alwaj's cook it in boiling salted water 
until tender, before serving it in an}- waj-. Drain, and 
pour cold water over it to keep it from becoming pasty. 
Macaroni, as frequentl}' prepared, in long pieces, which 
utterl}' refuse to come out of the dish in a proper manner 
when served, is not attractive. Nor is it palatable when 
it is ov\y slightly seasoned, and is dried in the oven with- 
out a covering of sauce or crumbs. 

Macaroni. — Break one quarter of a pound of maca- 
roni in three-inch pieces, and put into three pints of boil- 
ing salted water. Boil twent}^ minutes, or until soft. 
Drain in a colander, and pour cold water through it to 
cleanse and keep it from sticking. Cut into inch pieces. 
La}' the strips on a board, parallel to each other, and cut 
through them all at once. Put in a shallow baking-dish 
and cover with a white sauce., made with a cup and a half 
of hot milk., one tablespoonful of butter^ and one table- 
spoonfid of flour, cooked according to directions for AVhite 
Sauce (see page 189). Add half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Mix two thirds of a cup of fine cracker crumbs with a third 
of a cup of melted butter, and sprinkle over the top. Bake 
till the crumbs are brown. 



Macaroni. 309 



If cheese be liked with it, use half a cicp of grated Par- 
mesan or an}^ other chy cheese. Put part of it with the 
macaroni, and mix the remainder with the crumbs. 

No. 2. — ^Mix tico hard-boiled eggs ^ chopped fine, with 
the macaroni. Sprinkle each la^'er with salt and pepper^ 
and add a little made mustard., if 3'ou wish. Cover with 
milk and buttered crumbs., and bake until the crumbs are 
brown. 

JSFo. 3. — Pour a rich ichite sauce over the macaroni, 
and serve grated cheese on a separate dish. 

Macaroni and Tomatoes. — Boil as above, and cover 
with tomato sauce. Fry one tablespoonfid of chopped 
onion in one tablespoonfid of butter. Add one large table- 
spoonful oi flour ; when well mixed, add graduallj' a cup 
and a half of strained tomato and half a teaspoonful of 
salt. Pour over the macaroni, and warm in the oven ; or 
cover with buttered crumbs., and bake until the crumbs are 
brown. 

Spaghetti. — This is a variety of macaroni about one 
eighth of an inch in diameter. It is usuallj- served un- 
broken. Take a handful of the long sticks, plunge the 
ends into rapidly boiling salted water. As they soften, 
bend and coil the spaghetti in the w^ater, without breaking 
it, until it is all softened. Boil until tender. Drain, pour 
cold water through it, and serve without cutting, if you are 
skilled in the art of winding it around your fork, as the 
Italians do. Serve the same as macaroni, with cream or 
tomato sauce, cheese, and crumbs. 



Salads. 

Green vegetables which are eaten raw and dressed 
with oil, acids, salt, and pepper, are classed as salads. 
Potatoes, string beans, beets, asparagus, cauliflower, and 
man}' other vegetables which have been cooked, are eaten 
cold with a salad dressing. Lobster, oysters, salmon, and 
other kinds of cooked fish, eggs, chicken, and delicate 
meats are combined with lettuce, cresses, or celerj', and

salad dressing, and furnish man}' appetizing and refreshing 
varieties of this useful form of food. 

There is a strong prejudice with many against the use 
of oil. It is not strange when we remember the rancid 
oil sometimes offered us. Pure olive oil is seldom to be 
obtained, if we are to believe all that the opposers of adul- 
teration assert. No doubt much that is sold as olive oil 
is made from cotton seed ; but if it were sold under its 
right name and at a reasonable price there would be no 
objection to its use. When properlj^ purified, and sweet, 
it may be as wholesome as olive oil. The}' are both veg- 
etable oils, which are always considered more nutritious 
than animal oils. Oil is one of the best forms of fat we 
can use, and aids in digestion. Oil, when taken only in 
lobster salad or at late suppers, as is often the case, is 
held accountable for the horrors and torment following 
such a use ; but if used seasonably and moderately, there 
will be no ill effects. 



French Dressing. 



1 saltspoonful salt. 

% saltspoonful pepper. 

3 tablespoonfuls oil. 



J^ teaspoonful onion juice. 
1 tablespoonful vinegar. 



Mix in the order given, adding oil slowly. 

This dressing is suitable for vegetable and egg salads, 
and is also used to marinate, or pickle, a meat or fish salad. 
The onion may be omitted, and lemon juice may be used 
instead of vinegar. A teaspoonful of made mustard 
added to a French dressing is liked by many. 



Boiled Dressing. 



Yolks of 3 eggs beaten. 

1 teaspoonful mustard. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

3^ saltspoonful cayenne. 
2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 



2 tablespoonfuls melted buttei 

or oil. 
1 cup cream or milk. 
% cup hot vinegar. 
Whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiflT. 



Cook in the double ])oiler until it thickens like soft cus- 
tard. Stir well. This will keep in a cool place two weeks,

and is excellent for lettuce, celery, asparagus, string beans, 
and cauliflower. 

Boiled Dressing for Cold SlaiL\ — ^o\\ half a cup of 
vinegar with tioo teaspoonfuls of sugrn\ half a teaspoon- 
ful each of salt and mustard^ and half a saltspoonful 
oi pepper. Rub a quarter of a cup of butter to a cream, 
with one teaspoonful oi flour., and pour the boiling vinegar 
on it. Cook five minutes, then pour it over one icell-heaten 
egg. The 3^olk only may be used, and the white saved for 
clearing co'ffee. Mix this dressing, wdiile hot, with one 
pint of red cabbage., shaved or chopped, or with a mixed 
vegetable salad. Cokl slaw is delicious served with fried 
o^^sters or fish. 



Mayonnaise Dressing. 



1 teaspoonful mustard. 

1 teaspoonful powdered sugar. 

}4 teaspoonful salt. 

y^ saltspoonful cayenne. 



Yolks of 2 raw eggs. 

1 pint olive oil. 

2 tablespoonfuls vinegar. 

2 tablespoonfuls lemon juice. 



Mix the first four ingredients in a small bowl. Add the 
eggs. Stir well with a small wooden spoon. Add the oil, 
a few drops at a time, stirring until it thickens. If hy 
chance you add too much oil, do not attempt to stir it 
all in at once, but take it up gradually. AVhen the dress- 
ing is thick, thin it with a little lemon, then add oil and 
lemon alternately, and lastlj' the A'inegar. When ready to 
serve, add half a cup oiv:hipped cream^ if 3'ou like. The 
cream makes it whiter and thinner. The oil should 
thicken the ^^^ almost immediately, and the mixture 
should be thick enough to be taken up in a ball on 
the spoon, before adding the vinegar. Should the 
^^^g not thicken quickl}^ and have a curdled appearance, 
half a teaspoonful of the unbeaten n^hite of egg or a few 
drops of vinegar will often restore the smooth consistenc}^ 
Be careful not to use too much, as it will make the dressing 
thin. The dressing liquefies as soon as mixed with vege- 
tables or meat ; therefore it should be made stiff enough 
to keep in shape until used. Many prefer to use a Dover 



312 The Boston Cook Book. 

egg-beater, and others succeed best with a fork. The 
mixture soon becomes too hard to use an egg-beater to 
advantage. Lobster coral, dried and pounded to a powder, 
will give a Mayonnaise a bright red color. Spinach green, 
green peas mashed, or chopped parsley will color it green. 
Never mix the Mayonnaise dressing with the meat or 
fish until ready to serve, and then only part of it, and 
spread the remainder over the top. 

Mayonnaise Tartare is simply the addition of chopped 
olives^ pickles^ parsley^ capers^ and onions to the May- 
onnaise. 

Lettuce Salad. — Pick over and wash each leaf with- 
out breaking. Shake off the water and drain in a net. 
Keep the lettuce in a cool place until ready to serve. 
Just before serving, dry between two towels. Arrange the 
leaves in a salad bowl, the larger leaves around the edge 
and the light ones in the centre. Serve with boiled dress- 
ing^ or French dressing^ or sugar., salt, and vinegar to 
taste. Lettuce should be served cool, fresh, and crisp. 
Never cut it, as that causes the leaves to wilt quicklj-. 
Tear them apart. 

Radishes or olives may be served with lettuce ; and 
when a brilliant effect is desired, garnish with a few nas- 
turtium blossoms. When lettuce is used witli other mate- 
rials, never mix them until read}' to serve. 

Dressed Celery. — Use only the white, crisp part of the 
celery stalks. The green parts may be made into a puree 
or used in soups. Scrape off the brown discolored part, 
and wash thoroughly. Keep in cold water, and when 
ready to serve, drain and arrange in a celery glass. Serve 
with salt. Or cut the celery in thin slices, moisten wnth 
French or Mayonnaise dressing, and garnish with lettuce, 
cresses, or celery leaves. Lettuce and celery may be 
served with the roast if desired. 

Cucumber Salad. — Cut off an inch from each end of 
the cucumber, and pare off a thick paring, as a bitter juice 
lies near the skin. Cut in thin slices, or shave with a 
vegetable cutter. Keep in cold water until ready to serve. 



Salads. 313 



Drain, and place in the bowl with ice. Serve with salt^ 
pepper, and vinegar, or with a French dressing. Young 
onions thinl}' sliced are "sometimes mixed with cucumbers. 

Cucumber and Tomato Salad. — Place a bed of crisp 
lettuce in a salad dish, then a laj'er of sliced cucumbers, 
then sliced tomatoes, and pour a French dressing, or a 
Mayonnaise, over the whole. Tomatoes peeled and cut 
into halves, and served with a spoonful of Mayonnaise 
on each half, make an attractive salad. 

Potato Salad. — One pint of cold boiled potatoes, cut 
in half-inch dice or shaved in thin slices, and seasoned 
with salt and pepper ; the yolk of one hard-boiled egg, 
one heaping tablespoonful of chopped parsley , hcdf a cup 
of cold beet dice, and a French dressing. Put alternate 
layers of potato, beet, 3'olk of egg, rubbed through a 
fine strainer, parsle}', and French dressing, until the 
materials are all used. Have parsley and ^gg on the 
top, and leave half of the dressing for the last la3'er. 
Or arrange the potatoes, parsley, and Qgg in the centre 
of the dish, then a circle of beets and lettuce around the 
edge, with French dressing sprinkled over the whole. 
Sliced onions, red cabbage chopped, capers, dice of 
tu7mips, and carrots cut into fanc}' shapes or rubbed 
through a strainer, may be used with potatoes for a 
salad. 

No, 2. — One pint of hot potatoes, mashed or cut in 
slices, half a cup of chopped cabbage, hcdf a cup of 
chopped celery, one tcd)lespoonfid of chopped parsley, 
one cucumber pickle, and one hard-boiled egg, chopped 
fine. Mix well, and add enough of Boiled Dressing 
No. 2 to moisten. Keep on the ice until ready to serve. 
Place tioo tcd)lespoonfuh on a leaf of lettuce, and serve 
in the leaf. 

Many professional cooks prefer to mix a potato salad 
while the potatoes are hot, as the salad looks more 
appetizing, will keep longer, and have less of the soggy 
peculiar taste than when made with cold potatoes. 
Rubbing a cut onion or a little garlic round the salad 



314 Th^ Boston Cook Book. 

bowl is sufficient where only a slight flavor of onion is 
desired. Vegetable salads are suitable for lunch or tea, 
or ma}' be served as a course at dinner. 

Egg Salad. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Cut the 
whites in thin slices, or chop them ver^^ fine. Arrange 
a bed of cresses on a dish. Make nests of the whites, 
and put one whole yolk in the centre of each nest ; or rub 
the yolks through a fine strainer over the whites. Sprinkle 
a French dressing over the whole. Serve small balls of 
cottage cheese with the salad. 

Oyster Salad. — Steam or parboil one pint of oysters. 
Drain, cool, and marinate them with a French dressing. 
Serve with cresses^ celery^ or lettuce^ and a Ma^'onnaise 
dressing. 

Fish Salad. — One quart of an}' kind of cold cooked 
Jlsh, flaked and freed from bones and skin, and placed on 
a bed of lettuce. Pound the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs., and three sai^dines (bones and skin removed) to a 
smooth paste. Mix this paste with the Boiled or the 
Mayonnaise dressing^ and pour it over the fish. Gar- 
nish with slices of lemon. 

Chicken Salad. — One pint each of cold boiled or 
roasted chicken and .celery., or half as much celer}' as 




Fig. 40. Chicken Salad. 

chicken. Cut the chicken into quarter-inch dice. Scrape, 
wash, and cut the celery in dice. Mix and marinate with 
a French dressing, and keep on the ice until ready to 
serve. Make a Mayonnaise dressing, and mix part of it 
with the chicken ; arrange the salad in a dish, pour the 
remainder of the dressing over it, and garnish with celery 



Salads. 3 1 5 



leaves and capers, or lettuce, and yolk of bard-boiled egg 
rubbed through a fine strainer. 

Lobster Salad. — Cut one 2nnt of lobster meat in dice, 
season with a French dressing, and keep it on ice until 
ready to serve, then mix with half of the 3IayonnaisG 
dressing. Make nests or cups of the crisp lettuce leaves 




Fig. 41. Lobster Salad. 

Put a large spooyifid of the lobster in each leaf, with a 
tablespoonfid of the Mayonnaise on the top. Garnish 
with capers and pounded coral., sprinkled over the dress- 
ing, and with lobster claws and pjarsleg round the edge. 

Salmon Salad. — Prepare in the same way with cooked 
or canned salmon, freed from bones, skin, and oil. 

Salad Sandwiches. — Mix a small quantity of Mayon- 
naise dressing with finel}' chopped lobster or chicken. 
Cover a small slice of bread with lettuce^ then the salad, 
lettuce, and bread again. Wrap them in tin foil or oiled 
paper, and serve at picnics or when travelling. 
Strawberry Salad. 
Choose the heart leaves of nice head httuce, and make 
cups of tivo leaves, stems crossed. Heap a few straiv- 
berries in the centre, dust lightly with povxlered sugar, 
and put a teaspoonful of Mayonnaise dressing on each 
portion. 

Sliced bananas may be served ni the same way.

PASTRY AND PIES. 

Puff Paste, when skilfully made, is light and tender, 
and so delicate that it cannot be touched without crushing. 
It should be thoroughly baked, and is therefore more suit- 
able for tarts and patties and the upper crust of pies. Eat 
it sparingly ; unless you have a good digestion, and exer- 
cise freel}^, never eat it. It is, however, less injurious 
than the ordinary pastry seen on manj- tables, as it con- 
tains no more shortening than much of the pastr}' made 
with a "guess measure" of lard. It is not so much the 
amount of fat the paste contains that makes it indigestible, 
as the inferior qualit}^ of the fat, such as rancid butter or 
impure lard, or the soggy, greas}', half-cooked paste. 

Pastr}' that is light, dr}', and flak}^ is more easily sepa- 
rated by the gastric fluids than that which is heav}'. Many 
housekeepers use lard in making pastr}^, as it is cheaper 
than butter, and makes a softer and more tender crust. 
Butter is more wholesome, and is preferable if you wish to 
make a brown crust. A mixture of half lard and half 
butter answers ver}- well for common paste, but for puflf 
paste butter alone should be used. In French receipts for 
puflT paste eggs are considered essential, but there is no 
necessity for their use. 

It requires practice to make puff paste well ; and as 
there are so many other dishes more easily made and 
vastly more important, it is better not to waste time 
and strength upon it. Let your ambition as a house- 
keeper soar higher than perfection in making puff paste. 
But those who will have it may observe the following 
directions. 

Puff Paste. — One poimd of i\\Q best butter^ one pound 
oi pastry flour ., one scant teaspoonful of salt^ about one 



Puff Paste, 317 



cup of ice water. By measure, use one quart of flour and 
one pint of butter. Scald the bowl, then fill with cold 
water. Dip the hands into hot and then into cold water ; 
this makes bowl and hands smooth, and keeps the butter 
from sticking. Wash the butter, by working it in the cold 
water, till soft and wax}-. Divide into four parts ; pat 
each part into a long and narrow piece, and wrap in a 
clean napkin. 

Have three shallow oblong pans that will fit the one into 
the other. Fill the largest and smallest of the pans with 
broken ice. Put the butter, covered with the napkin, into 
the other, and place it between the two pans of ice to 
harden. Mix the salt with the flour, then break in one 
quarter of the butter. Rub with the tips of the fingers, 
and keep plent}' of flour between the fingers and the but- 
ter. Man}' prefer to chop it, that the warmth of the hand 
may not soften the butter. When the butter and flour 
are well mixed, and fine and dr}' like meal, pour in the cup 
of ice water slowly. Mix with a knife, and cut, rather 
than stir. Wet onh' part of the flour at first and toss it 
to one side of the bowl, then wet another part ; and when 
it is all of the proper consistenc}', cut and mix it together 
till it can be taken up clean from the bowl with the knife. 
Add the last of the water cautiousl}', wetting only the dr}^ 
flour, and use less or more than the cupful as the flour 
may require. If the butter be softened by the heat in 
rubbing, it will moisten the flour, and less water will be 
required. But it should not be allowed to soften. The 
mixture should be light and dr}', like separate minute 
crumbs of butter coated with flour. 

Use a large smooth rolling-board and a glass rolling- 
pin. Put half a cup of flour in the dredger, and sprinkle 
the middle of the board with a light coating of flour. Toss 
the ball of paste in the flour with a knife until floured all 
over, then pat with the rolling-pin into a flat cake an inch 
thick. Have the end of the board next you, that you may 
roll the paste the required length. Hold the handles of 
the pin firmly, and roll with a light quick stroke as far as 



3i8 The Boston Cook Booh, 

your arms will allow, — the whole length of the paste, if 
possible, at every stroke. Do not attempt to roll the paste 
when it is in a ball or a cubical form, but pat it lightly, to 
make as large and flat a surface as possible before rolling. 
Roll out to the thickness of one third of an inch, and to a 
rectangular form. Lay one of the quarters of butter in a 
little flour on the corner of the board, and roll quickly into 
a long thin piece ; scrape it up with a knife, and lay along 
the middle of the whole length of the paste. Fold over 
one side of the paste, then the other, letting the edges just 
meet in the middle of the butter. Do not pat it down. 
Then fold each end to the middle and double again. Pound 
into a flat cake and roll again one quarter of an inch thick. 
Roll another piece of butter thin, lay it on the paste, fold 
the sides over, then the ends over, and then together, and 
repeat the process with the remaining pieces of butter. 
When the butter is all rolled in, the paste may be folded, 
patted, and rolled out, two, three, or seven times, as your 
strength will permit. Twice is enough for pies, three or 
four times for patties ; but more are needed for a vol-au- 
vent. 

When the butter is of the right texture, fine, smooth, 
and firm, not dry and crumbly, and the mixing and rolling 
are done so quickly and deftl}' that the butter does not 
soften, the paste will not stick, and ver}- little flour will be 
required in rolling. Do not strike a hard blow in rolling, 
nor press the paste down to the board, but roll with a 
light gentle stroke. When the paste does not slip along the 
board, 3'ou may know it is sticking, and it must be lifted 
at once, the board scraped clean, and floured slightl3\ 

Should the paste become soft and stick3^, fold again, 
and pat it out to the size of the pan, and put it in the 
napkin between the two pans of ice. It will harden in ten 
minutes, and then ma}' be rolled easil3\ After all the but- 
ter is in the dough, cut in two pieces, then roll and fold 
one, while the other is in the ice pan. Keep the board 
and pin wiped dr}', and use onl}- a little flour, but use 
enough to keep the paste from sticking. 



Patty Shells. 319 



Keep the edges even while rolling, and fold evenly, that 
there ma}' be an equal number of layers in all parts. Each 
time the paste is folded over thie butter a small amount of 
air is enclosed and is retained, unless the fold be patted 
down and allow the air to escape at the end. These bub- 
bles of air may be plainly seen when the ball of dough is 
patted and rolled out, and care must be taken not to let 
the air escape. For this reason roll lightly and always 
from you^ as a hard motion back and forth is more liable 
to break the bubbles. Roll with a fan-like sweep, a httle 
to the right and left, to widen it and keep the rectangular 
shape ; then roll genth* on the edge nearest 3'ou, to make 
it of uniform thickness. The more of the bubbles you can 
retain in the paste, the lighter and more puffy it will be. 
The number of folds or layers of butter and paste makes 
the paste flaky, but the amount of air in it makes it rise 
and puff in baking. 

The paste should be folded and rolled till no streaks of 
butter can be seen. After the last rolling, place it on the 
ice to harden, as it maj^ then be cut and shaped more 
easily. 

To Bake Puff Paste. — The dough should be icy cold 
when it is put into the oven. If the patties soften after 
being shaped, place them between the pans of ice till they 
are hard. The oven should be about as hot as for rolls, 
with the heat greater underneath, that the paste may rise 
nearly to its full height before browning ; then quicken the 
fire to brown the tops, and turn the heat from underneath 
or put a pan or grate under to prevent burning. If the 
oven be too hot. the paste will bum before it is risen ; if 
too slow, it will melt and spread. 



Fatty SheUs, Tarts, Vol-au-vents, and other Forms of 
Puff Paste. 

There are two waj's of shaping the paste for patties 
and tarts. First, roll puff paste one eighth of an inch 
thick, and stamp out circular pieces with a cutter, two and 



320 The Boston Cook Book. 

one half inches in diameter. With a smaller cutter stamp 
out the centres from half of these pieces, leaving rings half 
an inch wide. Dip the cutters in hot water, and cut 
quicklj-, that the edges may not be pressed together or 
cut unevenl}'. Rub a little white of egg on the top of 
the large rounds near the edge, put on the rings, and press 
them lightl}' to make them adhere, but be careful not to 
get any egg on the edges, as that will prevent them from 
rising. Put round pieces of stale bread, cut half an inch 
thick, in the centre, to keep the paste from rising and fill- 
ing the cavit}^ Bake on shallow pans lined with paper, 
and when done remove the bread and soft paste under- 
neath. Bake the small pieces cut from the centre on a 
pan b}" themselves, as the}' take less time for baking. In 
serving place them on the top of the shells for a cover. 

Another waj^ is to roll the paste one fourth of an 
inch thick, cut with a round cutter, and then with the 
smaller cutter cut nearly through the centre of each round, 
making a rim half an inch wide. After baking remove the 
centre crust and soft part underneath, without breaking 
through, as then the shell will not hold any liquid mixture. 
Some persons prefer this method ; but there is less waste 
when cut in the first way, as the parts cut out may be 
baked for covers, and usually prove to be the most delicate 
part of the pa^^te. Or, if covers are not wanted, these cen- 
tres may be rolled out thinner, and used as bottom pieces. 
The paste for patties is usually rolled one fourth of an 
inch thick and cut with a plain cutter. Two or three rims 
may be put on when a deeper shell is desired. Any kind 
of delicate cooked meat or fish (chicken, sweetbreads, 
oysters, lobster, etc.) may be cut into small pieces, and 
warmed in a thick cream sauce (see page 278), and served 
hot in patty shells, with a cover of the paste. 

Tarts are made thinner, and cut with a fluted cutter. 
They are filled Mdth jelly or preserves, and served cold 
without a cover. 

CupicVs Wells. — Cut the rounds of puff paste of three 
or four different sizes ; use the largest one for the bottom, 



Fancy Puff Paste. 321 

and cut the centres from the others, leaving the rims of 
different widths, and put them on the whole round, with 
the narrowest at the top. Bake, and fill with jell}'. 

Vol-au-vent. — This is made from the lightest form of 
puff paste, cut to any size and shape desired, a large oval 
being generalh' preferred. Mark the outline with an oval 
mould or pan, and cut quickl}' with a knife dipped in hot 
water. Put on two or three rims, wetting the edge of each 
with white of egg. Make an oval hoop of stiff paper, two 
inches high, and slightly larger than the vol-au-vent, and 
place around i^ to prevent scorching. Bake a large vol- 
au-vent nearly an hour. 

Cakes a la Polonaise. — Ro' puff paste very thin, cut 
into pieces three inches square, wet tho centre, turn each 
corner over, press the point down in the centre, and put 
a very small round of paste on the centre. Bake, and 
when cool put dots of jelly on each corner. 




Fig. 42. Bow-Knots. 

Bow-KnotK. — Cut thin puff paste into half-inch strips, 
and shape them on the baking-pan into the form of a 
double bow-knot. When baked, put jelly on each loop 
of the bow. 

Bissoles. —Roll the scraps of puff paste thin, and cut 
into rounds. Put a spoonful of whatever material is to be 
used in the centre of half of the number, wet the edges, 
and cover with the remaining rounds, first cutting a cross 
in the middle, or stamping out a small piece with a vege- 
table cutter or pastry tube. Any kind of cold meat may 
be cut fine, seasoned to taste, moistened with a white 
sauce, and used in the rissoles. Or they may be filled 
with stewed and sweetened fruit, or mince meat prepared 

21

as for pies. The}- may be cut into larger rounds, the 
filling placed on one half, and the edges folded together 
like turnovers. Bake in a hot oven. 

Plaits. — Roll verj' cold puff paste thin, and cut into 
half-inch strips. Braid them together, and bake quickl}'. 

Cheese Straios. — Roll scraps of puff paste thin, 
sprinkle with grated cheese, and cayenne pepper if 3'ou 
like, fold, roll out, and sprinkle again, and repeat the 

process. Then place on the 
ice to harden. When cold, 
roll into rectangular shape 
one eighth of an inch thick ; 
place it on a baking-pan, and 
Fio.43. Cheese straws. ^ith a pastry cutter dipped 

in hot water, cut into strips 
four or five inches long and less than a quarter of an inch 
wide. Bake, and serve piled cob-house fashion. Some- 
times, when the paste is ver^^ hard, the}" are cut as narrow 
as possible, laid on the pan in groups of five or six, with 
one straw laid over the middle to represent a bundle of 
straws, and baked in that form. 

Pies. 
For Pies^ roll the puflT paste out a quarter of an inch 
thick, then roll up, and cut from the end of the roll. Turn 
each piece on the side, so that the folds show in rings, and 
pat out flat, then roll to fit the plate. Keep the paste in a 
circular form, and roll eventy in ever}" direction. Make 
slightl}' larger than the plate, as the paste shrinks when 
taken from the board, and should be fulled in rather than 
stretched to the required size. After a little practice it 
is just as easy to judge of the amount of paste required for 
one crust, and roll it in this wa}^ to fit the plate, as to roll 
so large a quantity that the edges have to be tiimmed oflf 
and mixed with the remainder of the paste. Roll some of 
the paste, and cut into strips three quarters of an inch wide ; 
wet the under crust and place the rim on the edge. Use 
one rim for pies which are to be covered, and two, if 3'ou 



Plain Pastry. 323 



like, for pies without an upper crust. Fill the plate with 
the material to be used. Roll the upper crust larger than 
the plate, make a cut in the centre to let the steam escape, 
wet the rims, put the crust on the edge even with the 
rim and slightly fuller in the centre, to allow for shrinking 
in baking ; otherwise the crust, as it is forced up bj the 
steam within, will draw away from the edge. 

Wet every spot of the rim and edge, and press closely 
but hghtly together, to keep the juices from boiling out. 
All pies, meat pies especially, with a top crust should have 
several holes cut in the crust to let the steam escape. 
All fruit pies are better flavored if made with fresh, rather 
than stewed, fruits. If to be filled with juicy fruit, or 
cream, they are more wholesome prepared as follows: 
Bake the two crusts separately, stew the fruit, fill, and put 
the two together. Or fill, with a mock filling of pieces of 
clean cloth, bake, remove the cloth, and just before serving

deep, well-buttered pudding-dish, holding at least three 
quarts. Bake very slowly seven or eight hours. Do not 
stir, but cover with a plate if it bake too fast. One cup 
of currayits may be used to give variety. 

Baked Indian Meal Pudding (made quickly). 

Boil one quart of milk. Pour it gradually on three 
tablespoonfuls of granulated Indian meal. Put it back 
in the double boiler, and boil one hour, stirring often. 
Then add 07ie heaping tablespoonful of butter^ one tea- 
spoonful of salt., half a cup of molctsses., two eggs^ and one

hours and a half, and serve with cream or any plain 
pudding sauce. 0)ie cup of dates, fig s^ stewed prunes, or 
chopped apple makes a pleasing variet}'. This is an 
economical pudding, wholesome for children and invalids 
when served with cream, and rich enough to suit any one 
when served with creamy or foamy sauce. 



Steamed Fruit Pudding. 



2 eggs. 

% cup sugar. 

1 pint berries, or ripe fruit or cut 

small, or 
1 cup raisins, stoned and halved. 



1 pint flour. 

3 level teasp. baking-powder. 

3^2 teaspoonful salt. 

1 cup milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 

Mix the baking-powder and salt with the flour ; add the 
milk and melted butter. Beat the 3'olks of the eggs, add 
the sugar, and beat them well into the dough. Then add 
the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff; and then the fruit, 
well rolled in flour. Steam two hours, and serve with 
lemon or foamy sauce. 

Steamed Suet and Fruit Pudding. 



232 cups flour. 

1 teaspoonful soda. 

1.^ teaspoonful salt. 

3^ saltspoonf ul cinnamon. 

% saltspoonf ul nutmeg. 



1 cup chopped suet, or 

% cup butter. 

1 cup chopped raisins or currants. 

1 cup water or milk. 

1 cup molasses. 

Sift the soda, salt, and spice into the flour, rub in the 
butter, and add the raisins. Mix the milk with the 
molasses, and stir it into the dry mixture. Steam in a 
buttered pudding-mould three hours. Serve with foamy 
sauce. 

K water and hutter be used, three cups of flour will be 
required, as these thicken less than milh and suet. This 
pudding is sometimes steamed in small stone cups. 

Cabinet Pudding. 

Butter a melon mould, and decorate it with candied 
fruit, or with raishis boiled till soft and seeded ; then put 



340 The Boston Cook Booh 

in a la^'er of lady fingers or stale sponge caJce, then a 
few pieces of fruit, and repeat till the mould is nearl}^ full. 
Pour 07ie innt of foiling milk into the yolks of three eggs^ 
beaten with three tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Pour over the cake in the mould. Set 
the mould in a pan of warm water on the back of the stove 
half an hour, then bake one hour, keeping it in the pan of 
hot water. Or steam it one hour. Serve hot with wiiie 
or foamy sauce. 

Six macaroons or six cocoanut cakes may also be used, 
and the custard maj^ be flavored with wine. 

Christmas Plum Pudding. {Mrs. J. M. Towne.) 

One pint and a half of grated bread crumbs (soft, not 
dried), one pint of chopped suet., one pint and a half of 
currants and stoned raisins mixed, hcdf a cup of citron 
shaved thin, one scant cup of sugar ^ half a teaspoonful 
of salt., half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg^ five eggs., 
two even tables^jooiifids of flour., made into a thin batter 
with milk^ and half a glass of brandy. Mix in the order 
given, and boil or steam four hours. Serve with yellow 
sauce. 

Thanksgiving Plum Pudding. {Mrs. S. M. Baileij.) 

Six butter crackers^ rolled fine, and soaked in three 
pints of milk. Cream one quarter of a cup of butter with 
one cup of sugar / add half a teaspoonful of salt., one 
teaspoonful of mixed spice^ and six well-beaten eggs. Stir 
it all into the milk, and add one pound of the best raisins. 
Bake in a deep pudding-dish, well greased with cold 
butter. Bake very slowly in a moderate oven three or 
four hours. Stir several times during the first hour, to 
keep the raisins from settling. Make half of this receipt 
and steam it in a pudding- mould. Butter the mould, and 
line it with macaroons. 



Blanc Mange. 341 



CUSTARDS, JELLIES, AND CREAMS. 



Irish Moss Blanc-Mange. 

% cup Irish moss. I 1 saltspoonful salt. 

1 quart milk. I 1 teaspoonful vanilla. 

Soak the moss in cold water fifteen minutes ; pick over, 
wash, tie in a lace bag, and put it into the double 
boiler with the milk. Boil until the milk thickens when 
dropped on a cool plate. Add the salt ; strain and flavor. 
Mould in small cups or in egg-shells. Break off a piece 
as large as a ten-cent piece on one end of the egg-shell, 
pour out the ^g^, rinse the shells, stand them upright in a 
pan of meal, and fill with the blanc-mange. Serve blanc- 
mange with sugar and cream ^ also with apple or grape 
jelly ; or put half a peach or an v candied fruit in the bot- 
tom of the cup before filling. 

Blanc-mange ma}- be made b}' using one tablespoon- 
ful of sea-moss farina. Stir it into the boiling milk, 
and cook twenty- minutes. Or use three tahlespoonfuls of 
Hecker' s farina in the same wa}'. Cornstarch and gela- 
tine are often used, but they are neither palatable nor 
nutritious without eggs. 

Chocolate Pudding. — Use the same proportion of moss 
and milk as in the preceding rule. Put one square of 
chocolate in a saucepan with tico tahlespoonfuls each of 
sugar and icater. Stir, and boil until smooth ; add a little 
of the milk, until thin enough to pour easilv, then mix it 
well with the remainder of the milk. Add the moss, and 
boil till thick. 



342 The Boston Cook Boole, 



Banish Pudding, or Fruit Tapioca. 



}^ cup pearl tapioca. 
1% pint boiling water. 
1 saltspoonf ul salt. 



1^ cup sugar. 

}^ tumbler currant jelly. 



Pick over and wash the tapioca. Put it in the double 
boiler with the boiling water, and cook one hour, or till 
soft and transparent, stirring often. Add the salt, sugar, 
and currant jell}-. Stir till the jellj- is all dissolved. Poui 
into a glass dish, and keep on ice. Serve ver}- cold with 
sugar and cream. Half a cup of lemon juice ^ or any acid 
fruit syrup, or one cup of canned apricot, peach, or quince, 
may be used instead of the jelly. Or, in summer, use one 
'pint of ripe berries^ or any sinall fruits^ adding more sugar 
as requh-ed. 

Fruit Pudding. — Cook one quart of ripe berries or 
canned peaches or apricots with one pint of water., and 
sugar to taste, till the fruit is well scalded. Skim out the 
fruit into a dish for serving. Wet one scant cupful of 
fine granulated wheat flour in a little cold water, stir it 
into the boiling syrup ; cook ten minutes, and pour it over 
the fruit. Serve very cold with cream. 

Boiled Custard. 

1 pint milk. | }/^ saltspoonf ul salt. 

Yolks of 3 eggs. }/^ teaspoonful vanilla. 

3 tablespoonf uls sugar. j 

Scald the milk. Beat the yolks, add the sugar and 
salt, and beat well. Pour the hot milk slowly into the 
eggs, and when well mixed pour all back into the double 
boiler, and stir constantly till smooth and thick like cream. 
Strain, and when cool add the flavoring. Do not stir the 
Qg^ into the hot milk, as there is danger of curdling, and 
a part of the Qgg will be left in the bowl. Scalding the 
milk hastens the process, so that less stirring is required. 
When nearly thick enough, the foam on tlie top disappears, 
and the custard coats the spoon ; but the surest test is 



Custards, 343 



given b}^ the sense of feeling. You are conscious that the 
custard is thicker b}' the way the spoon goes through it. 
Do not leave the custard an instant ; take it off as soon as 
it is smooth, as it will thicken in cooling, and curdles 
quickly if cooked a moment too long or if left in the boiler. 
Have a fine strainer placed in a bowl or pitcher before you 
begin to cook the custard, that j-ou may strain it quickh*. 

Boiled custard, when to be used as a sauce, should be 
thin enough to pour ; when to be served as a custard, it 
should be cooked a moment longer, to make it thicker. 

Four or even^ft'e eggs to a pint of milk ma}' be used 
when a rich custard is desu'ed. But three are sufficient 
for nearl}' all purposes. 

Boiled custard is much smoother when onh' the yolks of 
the eggs are used. Mau}- combinations ma}' be made by 
adding the whites of the eggs after the custard is cold. 
Beat the whites stiff, put them on a sieve, and cook over 
steam, or pour boihng water through them. The water 
will cook and stiffen the Qgg, and when well drained it may 
be piled in rocky form on the custard. Or the white may 
be poached by dipping it by the spoonful into boiling milk. 
Serve the custard in a large glass dish, and pile the white 
in a mass, or put spoonfuls of it here and there on the cus- 
tard, with bright-colored jelly on the white ; or serve in 
small glass custard cups with the white and jelly on the 
top. Or pour the custard over slices of sponge cake 
(soaked in wine, if you prefer), and cover with a me'ringue 
of the whites sweetened and flavored. Floating Island^ 
Flummery, Tipsy Pudding, and hosts of other dishes 
are only fancy names given to the different combinations 
of cake, boiled custard, and meringue. 

Any of the following ingredients may be used as flavor- 
ing ; this will give a variety of dishes, which want of space 
prevents us from giving as separate receipts : hcdf a square 
of chocolate^ melted ; the three table s2')Oonfuls of sugar 
melted to a caramel before mixing with the yolks ; one cup 
of grated cocoanut., or cocoanut calces crumbled ; six mac- 
aroons soaked in icine ; one cup of chopjped almonds or 



344 The Boston Cook Booh 

any of the varieties of candied fruits; foui- oranges^ 
peeled, seeded, and cut fine ; one pint of any canned fruit ; 
one pint of lemon ^ icine^ or orange jelly ^ cut in cubes. 
Or color the meringue pink by beating three tablespoon- 
fuls of bright-colored jelly with the whites ; or brown it 
with a salamander or hot poker, or by putting the dish 
on a board in the oven. 

Baked or Steamed Custard. 

1 quart milk. i 6 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

6 eggs. I 1 saltspoonf ul salt. 

Scald the milk. Beat the eggs ; add the sugar and salt, 
then the scalded milk. Strain, add a little nutmeg, and 
bake about twent}^ minutes in a deep dish or in cups set 
in a pan of warm water ; or steam in a bowl or in cups. 
Test the custard with a spoon ; if it come out clean, the 
custard is done. 



Caramel Custard. 



% cup sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls water. 

1 quart milk. 



6 eggs. 

y^ teaspoonful salt. 

1 teaspoonful vanilla. 



Put the sugar in an omelet pan, and stir until it melts 
and is light brown ; add the water, and stir into the warm 
milk. Beat the eggs slightly, add the salt and vanilla and 
part of the milk. Strain into the remainder of the milk, 
and pour into a buttered two-quart mould. Set the mould 
in a pan of warm water, and bake thirty to forty minutes, 
or till firm. Cut into the middle with a knife ; if it come 
out clean, the custard is done. Serve cold with caramel 
sauce. 

Delicate Pudding. 



1 cup water. 

1 cup fruit juice. 

3 tablespoonfuls cornstarch. 



}4 saltspoonf ul salt. 
Sugar to taste. 
3 eggs. 



Boil the water and fruit juice (orapge, lemon, or canned 
cherries, quince, or apricot). Wet the cornstarch in a little 



Faney Custards. 345 



cold water ^ stir into the boiling s^rup, and cook ten min- 
utes. Add the salt and sugar to taste ; the quantit}^ de- 
pending upon the fruit. Beat the whites of the eggs till 
foamy, and stir, into the starch. Turn at once into a 
mould. Serve cold with a boiled custard sauce made with 
the yolks of the eggs. 

Apple Snow. 

3 large tart apples. I % ^up powdered sugar. 

3 eggs (whites). I )^ cup jelly. 

Stew or steam the apples (cored and quartered, but not 
pared), drain, and then rub them through a hair sieve. 
Beat the whites of the eggs stiff, add the sugar, beat again ; 
add the apple, and beat till like snow. Pile lightly in a 
glass dish, garnish with jelly or holly leaves. Serve with 
boiled custard. 



Tapioca Cream. 



2 tablespoonfuls pearl tapioca. 
1 pint milk. 
Yolks of 2 eggs. 
3^ cup sugar. 



% saltspoonful salt. 

"Whites of 2 eggs. 

jo teaspoonful vanilla. 



Soak the tapioca in hot icater enough to cover it, in the 
top of the double boiler placed on the back of the stove. 
When the water is absorbed, add the milk, and cook until 
the tapioca is soft and transparent. Beat the j'olks of the 
eggs, add the sugar and salt. Pour the boiUng mixture on 
them, and cook two or three minutes, or till it thickens like 
boiled custard. Remove from the fire, add the whites of 
the eggs, beaten to a foam. Stir well, and when cool 
flavor. Do not try to mould it, as it is more delicate when 
soft. 

Jellies and Fancy Dishes made with Gelatine, Custard, 
and Cream. 

Gelatine, as now obtained, is refined and clarified during 
the process of manufacture, and this renders it unnecessary 
to use the white of ^gg in making jellies, as was required 



346 The Boston Cook Booh 

when using the old preparation of isinglass and gelatine. 
Much of the strength and flavor of jellies is lost in clearing 
them with eggs. Cox's gelatine makes a clear jell}', but it 
softens slowly and requires a strong flavoring like wine 
or lemon to disguise the fish}' taste. Nelson's and Knox's 
gelatines are of fine qualit}^ soften quickly, have an agree- 
able flavor, and are well adapted to creams and other deli- 
cate dishes. Knox's is unusuall}' pure, being made from 
calves' heads. 

Never cook gelatine. Soak (not dissolve) it in cold 
water, in the proportion of one cup of cold water to one 
box of gelatine. It will soften in fifteen minutes, if stirred 
often. Then dissolve in boiling liquid, — either water, 
milk, or custard, — and alwa3's strain through a fine 
strainer after it is dissolved. 



Gelatine Pudding, or Spanish Cream. 



^ box gelatine.^ 

3^ cup cold water. 

^ cup boiling water. 

Yolks of 3 eggs. 

3 tablespoonf uls sugar. 



% saltspoonf ul salt. 
1 pint milk. 
Whites of 3 eggs. 
1 teaspoonful vanilla. 



Soak the gelatine in the cold water till soft, then dis- 
solve it in boiling water. Make a custard with the yolks 
of the eggs, beaten, and mixed with the sugar and salt. 
Pour on the hot milk, and cook in the double boiler till 
it thickens. Then add the strained gelatine water, the 
vanilla, and the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff". Mix all 
well, and turn into moulds wet in cold water. Place in ice 
water, and when hard and ready to serve turn out on a 
dish. 

Italian Cream. — Use the same proportions as in the 
preceding receipt. Dissolve the soaked gelatine in the hot 
custard instead of in hot water, and strain the whole while 
hot into the beaten whites. When well mixed, add lemon 
or vanilla^ and pour into a mould. 

Quakifig Custard. — The same proportions as in Span- 

1 If granulated gelatine, use \\ tablcrpoons. 



Snoiv Pudding 347 



ish Cream. Dissolve the soaked gelatine in the hot cus- 
tard, and strain into a mould. When read}' to serve, 
beat the whites of the eggs stiff, add three heaping table- 
spoonfuls oi poindered sugar ^ and the/i<ice of one lemon. 
Turn the custard on a platter, and heap the meringue 
around it. 



Snow Pudding. 



}/^ box gelatine.^ 
3^ cup cold water. 
1 cup boiling water. 
1 cup sugar. 
3^ cup lemon juice. 
Whites of 3 eggs. 



Yolks of 3 eggs. 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

3^ saltspoonful salt. 

1 pint hot milk. 

3^ teaspoonful vanilla. 



Soak the gelatine in the cold water fifteen minutes, or 
until soft. Then dissolve it in the boiling water ; add the 
sugar and lemon juice. Stir till the sugar is dissolved. 
Strain into a large bowl, and set in ice water to cool. Stir 
occasionally' . Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, 
and when the gelatine begins to thicken, add the beaten 
whites, and beat all together till ver}' light. When nearly 
stiff enough to drop, pour into a mould. Or beat until 
stiff enough to hold its shape, if 3-our strength will allow, 
and pile lightly in a tall glass dish. Make a boiled custard 
of the 3'olks of the eggs, the sugar, salt, and milk, and when 
cool flavor with vanilla. Serve the sauce in a pitcher. Or, 
if the snow be moulded, turn it out on a dish, and pour the 
sauce around the pudding. The snow may be turned into 
a shallow dish, two inches deep, to harden, and when ready 
to serve cut into blocks and piled like a pyramid. Blocks 
of lemon or vnne jelly ^ mixed with the snow or sparkling 
jelly (jelly broken up lightly with a fork), make a pleasing 
variety. If the whites of the eggs be added to the gelatine 
mixture before it becomes cold, as is directed in man}' re- 
ceipts, more time will be required for the beating. Many 
have never made the dish a second time on accoiuit of the 
time and strength expended. Fifteen minutes is sufficient 
when made according to this receipt. 

1 If granulated gelatine, use \\ tablespoons.

Imperial Cream. 

Make the rule for Lemon Jelly (page 350), and color part 
of it pink with cochineal or cranberry juice. Harden it in 
a shallow pan. Make Snow Pudding (page 347) , and when 
nearl}' stiff enough to drop, stir in small squares of the 
pink and le^non jelly. Mould, and when read}' to serve, 
turn out on a dish, garnish the base and top with maca^ 
roons soaked in wine. Pour rich boiled custard round the 
dish, and put macaroons and cubes of the jellies in the 
custard. 

"WTiipped Cream. 

Many wholesome, delicious, and attractive dishes may 
be made with whipped cream. To those who can obtain 
plent}^ of cream, these dishes afford a cheaper, more 
easilj^ prepared, and far more satisfactory^ course than 
pie and many forms of hot puddings. Many of them 
are equalty suitable for tea. Very rich cream should be 
diluted and well mixed with an equal quantity' of milk. 
The best quality of cream obtained from the milkman is 
asually of the proper consistenc3\ Thin cream will become 
liquid after whipping, and thick cream will turn to butter. 
The cream should alwa3's be icy cold ; when it is to be 
served as a garnish, or for cream whips, it should be 
sweetened and flavored before it is whipped. 

A whip churn is the best utensil for whipping cream. 
This is a tin C3'linder, perforated at the bottom and sides, 
and having a perforated dasher. When the cluirn is placed 
in a bowl of cream, and the dasher worked up and down, 
the air is forced from the c^'linder into the cream, causing 
it to become light and frothy. A Dover egg-beater will 
make the cream light, but it has a different consistency 
from that obtained by churning.

When the froth appears, stir it down once or twice, as the 
first bubbles are too large ; and when the bowl is full of 
froth, skim it off" into a granite pan placed on ice. Take 
off" the froth onh*, and do not take it off below the holes 
in the cylinder, as it whips better when the}' are covered. 
For this reason never whip a pint of cream in a three- 
quart bowl, and do not tr}' to whip it all, as usually a little 
is left in the bowl which is too thin to whip. 

One pint of cream should treble in whipping. If for a 
garnish, drain the whipped cream* on a hair sieve placed 
over a pan, and keep it on ice till stiff enough to keep it 
shape. Creams that are to be moulded are made stiffer 
by the addition of gelatine

the gelatine in the boiling water, and strain through a 
fine strainer over the whipped cream. Then stir (not 
beat) rapidl}' with the bowl of the spoon resting on the 
bottom of the pan. Turn the pan with the left hand while 
stirring with the right. If it feel lumpy, lift the pan 
from the ice and place it in warm water to melt the gela- 
tine. Stir till the gelatine is well mixed with the cream, 
and when nearly stiff enough to drop, turn it into the 
mould. Keep on ice, and when ready to serve, turn out

1 teaspoonful vanilla. 



Soak the gelatine in cold water till soft. Chill and 
whip the cream till jou. have three pints of the whip. 
Boil the remainder of the cream (or if it be all whipped, 
use a cup of milk) with the sugar ; and when boiling add 
the soaked gelatine. Stir till dissolved. Strain into a 
granite pan, add the vanilla or lemon, and wine if you 
wish ; or flavor with two tablesjjoonfuls of melted choco- 
late^ or one quarter of a cup of strong coffee. Place the 
pan in ice water, stir occasional!}', and when the mixture 
is thoroughly cold and beginning to thicken, stir in lightly 
the whipped cream. When nearly stiff enough to drop, 
pour into the moulds. 

This cream is sometimes moulded in small cups. 
Put half of a canned apricot ox peach., or three sections 
of orange., or several small cherries., or a candied plum.^ 
in the bottom of the cup before filling with the cream. 
Or line a bowl with whole strawberries and fill with the

with a few drops of the liquid jell}', and when hard add 
jeUy to cover the fruit. When this is hard, place a smaller 
mould in the centre on the jell}' and fill with ice. Pour 
the remainder of the jell}' between the two moulds, adding 
it slowh', and dropping in fruit here and there, if you 
choose, until the mould is full. When the jell}' is all firm, 
remove the ice, and add icarm^ not hot, water to the 
smaller mould, and take it out carefully, without breaking 
the wall of jelly. Fill the space with a Bavarian cream 
(page 356). Make a rich soft custard with the yolks of 
fice eggs^ half a cup of sugar, and a pint of milk ; strain, 
and flavor with vanilla. When ready to serve, dip the 
mould in warm water, put a dish over it, and invert dish 
and mould together. Remove the mould carefully, and 
pour the soft custard around the pudding. Make the soft 
custard while the jelly is hardening ; and do not put the 
materials for the Bavarian cream together until the small 
mould is removed from the jelly, and the cavity ready for 
the cream. Do not turn out of the mould until just before 
it goes to the table, as the slightest jarring breaks the 
jelly. A coffee cup within a quart bowl, and a small pail 
within a larger one, have been successfully used by those 
who had no moulds. 

A variety of dishes may be made by using the diflTer- 
ent colored jelhes and fruits ; and any of the creams stifl" 
enough to mould can be used as filling. Snoio Pudding. 
or Creme Diplornate and Wine Jelly, Norfolk Cream, 
and Lemon Jelly, Orange Sponge and Orange Jelly, are 
attractive combinations. It may also be made in two sizes 
of small moulds, serving one mould to each person.

Ice Cream. 361 



ICE-CREAM AND SHERBET. 

A GOOD ice-cream freezer should be in every kitchen ; 
for with it a great variet}' of wholesome and attractive 
dishes may be prepared with ver}^ little expenditure of 
time and strength. Fruit, cream, and eggs, when frozen, 
are more palatable in hot weather than when served in 
.other ways. A deep can, four inches in diameter, with a 
tight cover fitting outside the can, and packed in a firkin 
with ice and salt, makes a good substitute for a fi-eezer. 
B}^ scraping the cream from the sides and beating occa- 
sionall}' with a large bread-knife as the cream freezes, one 
ma}^ have a ver}' smooth quality of cream with very little 
efibrt. 

But whether with a patent or home-made freezer, the 
essential points are to have the ice finely crushed, to use 
the right proportion of coarse rock salt, and to beat the 
mixture thoroughly during the freezing. Salt has a great 
affinity for water, and when mixed with broken ice it 
unites with the water ; the ice, in changing from its solid 
form to a liquid, parts with its heat, and the mixture of 
melted ice and salt is man}' degrees colder than the ice 
alone. This is sufficient to reduce to the freezing-point 
the temperature of any liquid placed in the ice and salt. 
The finer the ice is crushed, the quicker it melts ; and the 
more the mixture is stirred, the sooner all parts become 
chilled. The melted ice and salt should surround the can, 
and not be drawn off" as fast as melted. For this reason 
it is a mistake to have the outlet for the water in the bot 
tom of the firkin. It should be just below the top of the 
can, and then the water will run out before it can get in- 
side the can. Draw it off only when it floats the ice. The 
ice should be nearly as fine as the salt. Use one part 



362 The Boston Cook Book. 

salt to three or four parts ice. An easy wa}^ is to measure 
eacli with a saucer or small shallow pan. Put in a la3'er 
of ice three inches deep (pack it in solidly), then a meas- 
ure of salt (sprinkle it evenly on the ice) , then three meas- 
ures of ice and one of salt, etc., till the freezer is fall. 
Pack each layer in closel}' with a wooden paddle, and turn 
the freezer handle occasionally while packing. Be sure that 
the freezer works perfectl}^ before adding the cream. The 
bearings and gears, and the socket in the tub should be 
kept well oiled- When the cream is thoroughly cold, pour 
it into the can. Turn slowly at first, and after ten minutes 
more rapidly, till you can turn no longer. Remove the 
beater, scrape off the cream, and beat and pack the 
cream closely in the can. Put a cork into the opening 
in the cover, and lay the cross-piece over to keep the can 
down in the ice. Cover with a piece of old carpeting wet 
in the salt and water. If the ice and salt have been well 
packed, and the cream is to be served within an hour and 
not moulded, no more ice will be needed ; bnt if to be 
kept longer, draw off the water and pack again. If to be 
moulded, beat the cream well, and pack into the mould ; 
bind the top with a buttered paper or cloth, cover closely, 
and bury in ice and salt. 

After using the freezer, clean and scald the can ; dry 
thoroughly, and keep it uncovered while not in use. 
Drain the salt left in the freezer, and use again. Use 
Turk's Island or coarse rock salt, and 7iot what is called 
coarse fine salt. 

Ice-Cream, ISTo. 1 (Philadelphia Ice-Cream). 

2 quarts cream ; if thick, add I 2 cups sugar. 

1 pint milk. I 2 tablespoonf uls vanilla. 

This is the simplest, and to many the most delicious, 
form of ice-cream. Scald the cream ; melt the sugar in it, 
and flavor when cool. Freeze as directed above. The 
cream should be very sweet and highly flavored, as both 
sweetness and flavor are lessened by freezing. To make 
it lighter and more delicate, whip the cream until you have 



Ice Cream. 363 



a quart of froth, and add the froth after the cream is partly 
frozen. Man}- prefer to add the whites of eggs, beaten 
till foamy, but not stiff. Use tico, three ^ or four eggs to 
each quart of cream. The proportion of sugar should varjr 
according to the flavoring used. 

Ice-Cream, No. 2 (Neapolitan Ice-Cream). 



1 quart milk. 

(6 or 8 eggs yolks). 

1 cup sugar. 



1 pint to 1 quart cream. 
Sugar to taste. 
Flavoring. 



Make a boiled custard with the milk, sugar, and the 
yolks of the eggs. Cook it slightly till smooth, but not 
curdled. Strain, and when cool add the cream, sugar to 
make it quite sweet, and any flavoring desired. The cus- 
tard, when made with cream instead of milk, makes the 
richest kind of ice-cream. If cream cannot be obtained, 
beat the whites of the eggs till foam}', and add them just 
before freezing. No matter how many eggs are used, a 
little cream, if not more than half a cupful, is a decided 
improvement to all ice-creams. It is better to make sher- 
bet, or fruit and water ices, than an inferior qualit}^ of ice- 
cream with milk. Ice-creams are richer and mould better 
when made with gelatine ; but care must be taken to flavor 
highh% to disguise the taste of the gelatine. Use a quarter 
of a box of Nelson's gelatine for tico qicarts of custard. 
Soak in half a cup of cold milk^ and dissolve in the boiling 
custard just as it is taken from the fire. If b}- any acci 
dent the custard should curdle in cooking, it will be smooth 
when frozen. 

Ice-Cream, No. 3. {Miss Parloa.) 



1 pint milk. 

1 cup sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 
1 saltspoonful salt. 



2 eggs. 

1 pint to 1 quart cream. 

3>^ to 1 cup sugar. 

1 tablesp. flavoring extract. 



Boll the milk. Mix the sugar, flour, and salt ; add the 
whole eggs, and beat all together. Add the boiling milk. 



364 The Boston Cook Book, 

and when well mixed turn into the double boiler, and cook 
twenty minutes, stirring constantl}^ till smooth ; after that, 
occasionall}'. When cool, add the cream, flavoring, and 
sugar to make it quite sweet. This makes a smooth and 
delicious cream ; and if the milk be boiling and the custard 
cook fulh^ twent}^ minutes, there will be no taste of the 
flour. 

The following flavorings, with either of these receipts 
for a foundation, will give a great many varieties of 
ice-cream. 

Vanilla Ice- Cream. — Use 07ie tablespoonful of Foss'' 
extract or one hea-ping tablespoonful of the pounded 
vanilla bean sugar. 

Lemon Ice- Cream. — One tablespoonful of lemon 
extract. 

Chocolate Ice-Creatn. — Melt tico bars of sweetened 
vanilla chocolate ^i\h one or two tableepoonfuls of icater ,' 
add a little cream or custard^ and when smooth stir it into 
the remainder of the custard. Add half a tablespoonful 
oi vanilla. Confectioners sometimes mix half a teaspoon- 
ful of Ceylon cinnamon with the chocolate. It gives a 
rich, spic}^ flavor. 

Coffee Ice- Cream . — Make half a cup of very strong 
black coffee for two quarts of cream ; or boil half a cup 
of ground coffee in the milk. 

Caramel Ice- Cream. — Add half a cup of caramel (see 
page 134), and omit part of the usual amount of sugar. 

Pineapyple Ice- Cream. — Add half a can of grated pine- 
apple or one pint of the ripje fruit, grated. 

Strawberry Ice- Cream. — Sprinkle sugar over the ber- 
ries ; mash, and rub through a fine sieve. Measure the 
juice, and use one pint oi juice to two quarts of cream or 
custard. Add more sugar as the berries require. Use 
the French bottled strawberries when the ripe fruit cannot 
be obtained. 

Banana Ice -Cream. — Make a custard with one pint 
of milk^ one cup of sugar^ and two eggs. When cold, 
add one pint of cream^ and six bananas^ sifted, or cut in 



Ice Cream. 365 



thin slices. Add a little lemon juice if the bananas lack 
flavor. 

Baked Apple Ice- Cream. — Bake and sift six sweet 
apples. Add one quart of rich cream, and sugar to taste. 
When the sugar is dissolved, freeze. 

Pistachio Ice- Cream. — One cup of pistachio 7iuts, and 
one quarter of a cup of almonds, blanched, chopped, and 
pounded to a paste. Add this to any receipt for ice-cream. 

Macaroon, Almond, Walnut, Cocoanut, or Brovyn 
Bread Ice- Cream may be made b}' adding one pint of 
either of the above ingredients to any receipt for ice- 
cream. Crumble the macaroons and cocoanut cakes, and 
brown them slightl}' ; dr}', crumble, and sift the brown 
bread, and chop the nuts fine. 

Fruit Ice -Cream. — Canned fruit, or ripe fruit sweet- 
ened to taste, and cut into small pieces, may be added to 
partlj' frozen cream, giving many delicious varieties. Use 
peaches, straicberries, raspberries, pineapples, apricots^ 
or cherries. 

Cafe Barf ait. — One pint of cream, one cup of sugar ^ 
half a cup of strong, clear coffee. Mix, chill, and whip. 
Take the froth off into a freezer or into a mould. Pack 
the mould in ice and salt, and let it stand two hours with- 
out stirring. 

Glace Cream. — Boil one cup of sugar and one scant 
cup of water until the syrup forms into a ball when rubbed 
in water between the finger and thumb. Then pour this 
sjTup in a fine stream into the ichites of th7'ee eggs beaten 
stiff, and beat till stiff and cool. Stir it into any frozen 
cream, made with a little less than the usual amount of 
sugar. 

Ice -Cream icith Condensed 3IilJc. — Mix one can of 
condensed milk with three pints of scalded milk, and use 
in making a rich custard, as directed in rule No. 2. Flavor 
highly, and add a pound of candied fruit if desired. 

Tutti Frutti. — Make either of the receipts for ice- 
cream, and flavor with two tablespoonfuls of Sicily Ma- 
ieira icine or Maraschino, When partlj^ frozen, add one 



366 The Boston Cook Book, 

pound of French candied fruity cut fine. Use a mixture 
of cherries^ plums^ apricots^ pineapjples^ pears^ strawber- 
ries^ and angelica root. Or use home-made preserves, 
carefully drained from the sjTup, and cut into dice. 

N'esselrode Pudding. — Shell 07ie pint of chestnuts. 
Blanch, and boil half an hour, then mash to a pulp, and 
stir into ice-cream made from rule No. 2. Strain, and 
when parti}' frozen add one p)int of mixed fruity cut fine. 

Frozen Pudding. — Make ice-cream, No. 3 ; add two 
tahlespoonfids of soaked gelatine^ flavor with wine and 
vanilla^ and freeze. Cut a pound of French fruit or 
hra7idy peaches in small pieces; or use half a pound oi 
mixed raisins^ currants^ and citron, and one cup of mac- 
aroons., pounded, or 07ie cup of mixed almonas and pista- 
chio nuts, pounded fine. Wash, and soak the currants and 
raisins until swollen. Remove the seeds, drain and quarter 
the raisins, and shave the citron in small thin slices. Mix 
half the fruit and nuts with the frozen cream. Butter a 
melon mould shghtl}', and line with lady fingers ; then 
sprinkle over a la3-er of mixed fruit, pack in the frozen 
cream nearl}' to the top, then a la3'er of fruit, and cover 
with cake. Cover closeh', and bind a strip of buttered 
cloth round the edge of the cover. Pack in ice and salt 
for two hours. When read}' to serve, dip quiekl}' in warm 
water, and turn out carefully. Sprinkle the remainder of 
the mixed nuts over the top, and garnish with cream, 
sweetened, flavored, and whipped. Some prefer to serve 
a rich boiled custard sauce, made with 07ie pint of cream, 
the yolks of four eggs, half a cup of sugar, and one tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. 



Plombiere. {Miss Ward.) 



1 quart milk. 
1 pint cream. 
6 whole eggs. 
3 egg yolks. 



1}.'2 cup sugar. 

2 ounces each of preserved cit- 
ron, greengages, and pine- 
apple, cut fine. 



Boil the milk and cream, and pour it on the beaten eggs 
and sugar. Cook slightl}', and when cool add the fruit, 
and freeze. 



jSherbets, Water Ices. 367 

Bombe Glace. — Line a mould or the freezer with one 
quart of raspberry or por^iegranate sherbet. Pack the 
sherbet round the bottom and sides of the mould one inch 
deep. Fill the centre with Bavarian cream., or Charlotte 
Russe cream, or Creme Diplomate. Cover with the sher- 
bet, and pack in ice and salt one hour. 

Biscuit Glace. — Ice-cream and sherbet are often served 
in small, fanc\' paper cases, which may be obtained at a 
confectioner's. Make and freeze the cream, and fill the 
paper cases with two kinds, either sherbet and plain ice- 
cream, or sherbet and tutti frutti, or Charlotte Russe cream 
and sherbet, or ice-cream. Pack the cases in a freezer, 
and keep on ice and salt till ver}' hard. Serve on a lace 
paper napkin laid on a fancj' plate. Sometimes the bis- 
cuits are covered with a meringue, and colored slightly 
with a salamander just before serving. 

Frozen Apricots. — Cut one can of ap)ricots into small 
pieces, add one p>int of sugar and one quart of loater. 
When the sugar is dissolved, freeze. When partly frozeri 
add, if you like, one p)int of whipped cream, measured 
after whipping. This is delicious without the cream. 
Peaches, pineapples, cherries, and strawberries are deli-

requires. 

Sherbets, or Water Ices. 

Sherbets, or water ices, are made with the juice of fruit, 
water, and sugar. With a supply of canned fruit, or fruit 
syrup always at hand, a variet}' of delicious desserts may 
be quickly prepared. A tablespoonful of gelatine^ soaked 
and dissolved, gives a light and smooth consistency to 
water ices. Man}' prefer to boil the water and sugar to a 
clear syrup, remove the scum, and when cool add the fruit 
juice ; and others use the white of e^g beaten stiif, add- 
ing it after the sherbet is parti}' frozen. The following 
are some of the most delicious water ices. Follow the 
directions given under Orange Sherbet, for all the other 
varieties.

G-ENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING 
CAKE. 

Study first the directions given under Measuring, Mix- 
ing, and Baking. 

Cake is a mixture of part or all of the following mate- 
rials : eggs, sugar or molasses, flour, butter or cream, milk 
or water, fruit, soda, cream of tartar, spices, etc. 

An unlimited variety of cakes may be made by varying 
the proportions of these materials, and to the same pro- 
portions man}' different names are given. Many amusing 
experiences are known of the eagerness with which a newly 
named receipt for cake is received, which, after many trials, 
has been found to be an old receipt arranged in a different 
order. An anal3'sis of the hundreds of receipts given in 
books devoted to cake-making would show that the gen- 
eral principles involved may be included under two di- 
visions, namely, receipts for sponge cakes^ made without 
butter; s^nd pound ov cup cakes ^ made with butter. Sponge 
cakes are made rich with eggs, the lightness depending 
wholty upon the amount of air beaten into the egg ; or an 
inferior quality is sometimes made by substituting soda 
and cream of tartar for part of the eggs, and adding more 
flour and some liquid, usually water. They vary in color, 
according as the white or yolk of the Qgg is used. Butter 
cakes are varied in the same way, and also by the addi- 
tion of fruit, or spices, or various coloring and flavoring 
materials. 

There is no one department in cooking where so much 
depends upon the baking as in making cake. The fire 
should be rather low, but sufficient to last through the 
entire baking. In many stoves it is exceedingly difficult 
to bake cake by a morning fire ; as so much coal is put on, 

24 



370 The Boston Cook Book. 

the fire is too hot and cannot be checked sufficiently. The 
oven should be less hot than for bread. If too hot, leave 
the oven door open for ten minutes before putting in the 
cake, then watch it, and protect it by putting over it a 
covering of paper, or a pan on the grate above. Do not 
attempt to make cake unless you can have entire control 
of the fire. 

Thin cakes require a hotter oven than those baked in 
thick loaves. If the oven be not hot enough at first, or be 
cooled too suddenly during the baking, the cake will not 
be light. Cakes with molasses in them burn more quickly 
than others. Thin cakes should bake from fifteen to 
twenty minutes, thicker cakes from thirty to forty minutes, 
very thiclv loaves about an hour, and fruit cake from two 
to three hours. Whichever kind you are baking, divide 
the time required into quarters. During the first quarter 
the heating is not manifested in appearance except by the 
rising ; during the second the cake should continue to rise 
and begin to brown ; then should become all over a rich 
golden brown ; and in the last quarter settle a little, brown 
in the cracks, and shrink from the pan. Be careful not to 
take it out too soon. If necessary to move it, do it very 
gently, and never move it when it has risen to the full 
height, but is not browned or fixed in its shape. 

If cake brown before rising, the oven is too hot. When 
it rises more in the centre, cracks open, and stays up, it is 
too stifi" with flour. It should rise first on the edges, then 
in the middle, crack slightly, settle to a level again, when 
the cracks usually come together. Nothing is more sug- 
gestive of bakeshop cake, or inferior quality in material, 
than a loaf with an upper surface having sharp edges, 
then hollows, and a peaked centre, as if the inside of the 
cake had boiled up and run out over the top. 

Line your cake tins with paper, to prevent burning the 
bottom and edges and to aid in removing the cake from 
the pans. Lay the paper over the outside of the pan, and 
crease it round the edge of the bottom. Allow it large 
enough to come above the top of the pan. Fold in the 



Cake Making. 371 



middle lengthwise and crosswise, and cut out the open 
corners to the crease made b}' the pan. Then fit it into 
the inside of the pan, and grease the paper, not the pan, 
with fresh butter or lard. Many use a rag tied on a stick ; 
others grease with a brush. Nice brushes are xqyj ex- 
pensive (and no others are suitable), and unless carefull}' 
cleaned are quite objectionable. Rags and paper absorb 
the grease which should be put on the pan, and in any case 
the fingers should be washed after the process. So there 
is no quicker, easier, or more economical way of greasing 
a tin than to rub the butter on with the fingers. 

Mix cake in an earthen bowl, and never in a tin pan. 
Use a wooden spoon, as iron spoons discolor the hand and 
the mixture. Use only the best materials. Go without 
cake rather than try to make it, or eat it when made, with 
what is called cooking butter and second-rate eggs. Such 
cake cannot be good or wholesome. Wash the butter, if 
very salt. Brown sugar is good for fruit cake, but for 
all other varieties use the finest granulated or powdered 
sugar. Very coarse granulated sugar makes heavy cake, 
with a hard and stick v crust. The flour should be drj'. 
When it has been kept in a cool place it should be 
slightly warmed, and alwa3's sifted before using. St. 
Louis flour — or pastry flour, as it is sometimes called — 
is best for cake. When new-process flour is used, taKe 
one eighth less. Soda, cream of tartar, and baking- 
powders should be crushed and sifted into the flour, then 
sifted two or three times with the flour. Mix spices 
with the flour or with the sugar. Mix a little of the 
measure of flour with the fruit to keep it from sticking 
together or settling. If the sugar be lumpy, crush and sift 
before using. Eggs should be fresh, and cooled b}- keep- 
ing in cold water or in the ice-chest. The 3'olks and 
whites should be beaten separately. Break each es^g on 
the edge of the cup, just enough to crack the middle of the 
shell, so the white will flow out, but not hard enough to 
break into the 3'olks. Then hold the egg over the cup, 
with the cracked side up, and break it apart. Let the 



3/2 The Boston Cook Book. 

white run into tlie cup, and keep the 3'olk in the half shell 
until all the white is drained off. Be careful not to break 
the .yolk, as the smallest portion of it in the whites will 
prevent them from frothing. Beat the 3'olks in a bowl, 
and the whites in a platter if you use a fork or whisk, or 
in a bowl if 3'ou use a Dover beater. Never stop beating 
the whites until thej^ are stiff and dry, as it is impossible 
to have them light if they become liquid again. 

Measure all the ingredients, and have the fire and all 
utensils read}', before 3'ou begin to mix. Observe the fol- 
lowing order in putting materials together. 

Sponge Cake Mixtures. — Beat the yolks until hght or 
lemon-colored and thick. Add the sugar gradually-, and 
beat again. Add the lemon juice or flavoring, and water, 
if that is to be used. Beat the whites until stiff and dry", 
and cut or fold them in lightlj^ then sift in the flour, and 
fold in carefuU}' without any stirring. Sponge cakes should 
not be beaten after adding the flour. Those made with 
soda and cream of tartar require less beating than those 
without, but they are a veiy poor substitute for genuine 
sponge cake. 

Butter Cake Mixtures. — Warm the bowl with hot 
water, then wipe dry. Put in the butter, and rub with 
a wooden or silver spoon until light and creamy. Be 
careful not to have the bowl so hot as to melt the butter. 
Add the sugar and beat again. If the habit of rubbing 
the butter and sugar together with the hand be alreadj- 
formed, and you find it easier than to use a spoon, it is 
hardly worth while to change ; but for those who are 
wholly inexperienced it is better to learn to use the 
spoon, and every lad}' would prefer to have her cook 
mix in that way. If the proportion of sugar be large 
for the butter, — more than double, — beat part of the 
sugar with the butter, and the remainder with the yolks 
of the eggs. Where a very small proportion of butter 
is to be used, it may be melted and mixed with the 
eggs and sugar. Beat the yolks till light and thick, 
then beat them well with the butter and su2:ar. Add the 



Sponge Cake. 373 



flavoring. Then add a little milk, then a little flour, and 
milk again, and continue until all the milk and flour are 
used. Lastly, add the beaten whites. All cakes made 
with butter require to be beaten long and ^igorouslj' after 
adding the flour, that they may be smooth and fine- 
gi'ained. Fruit should be added last ; cake with fruit 
should be a little stiffer with flour than that without 
fruit. Citron and large pieces of fruit may be put in 
in layers, or spread over the dough in the pan. 

All cake should be baked as soon as possible after it is 
mixed. Put the scrapings from the bowl into small tins. 
If put into the loaf, they sometimes cause a hea\^' streak 
through the top. 

Cake is baked when it shrinks from the pan and stops 
hissing, or when a straw inserted in the centre comes out 
clean. Remove the loaf from the pan as soon as baked, 
lifting it out by the paper ; or, if not papered, loosen the 
edges with a knife, and turn the pan over upon a cloth 
laid over a bread-cooler. Remove the pun as soon as 
possible. Never let cake stand in the pan to become 
moist. When cake is baked too hard or burned, rub off 
the burned surface with a coarse grater. 



Sponge Cake. 



5 eggs. 

1 cup sugar, powdered or fine 
granulated. 



1 saltspoonful salt. 

).2 lemon (grated rind and juice). 

1 cup pastry flour. 



See general directions for putting together (page 372). 
The mixture should be stiff and spongy, of the consistency 
of Charlotte Russe filling, as it is poured into the pan. 
Bake in a deep bread pan, in a moderate oven, nearly an 
hour, — in a shallow pan, about fort}' minutes. If stirred 
instead of beaten, the bubbles of air will be broken and the 
mixture will become liquid. TThen baked, it will be tough 
and too close-grained. To make this cake well, requires 
strength in beating and judgment in baking ; but when 
successful, it is one of the most satisfactory- and perfect

cakes made. Cut through the crust with a sharp pointed 
knife, then break apart. 

Sponge Cake. {Miss Josselyn.) — Beat the yolJcs of 
three eggs ; add one cup of fine granulated sugar ^ one 
tablespoonfid of lemon juice^ and one tahlespoonful of 
cold loater^ or a lump of ice melted in the lemon juice to 
make two tablespoonfuls of liquid. Add the whites^ beaten 
stiff, and one cup o'l pastry flour. 

Lady Fingers and Sponge Drops. — Four eggs, half 
a cup of powdered sugar ^ half a saltspoonful of salt^ one 
teaspoo'nful of flavoring^ and three quarters of a cup of 
pastry flour. See general directions for mixing sponge 
cakes. Pour the mixture into a pastr}^ bag, and press 
through it into shape, about three inches long and not 
quite one inch wide. Or drop b}^ the spoonful on a but- 
tered pan, and 3'ou have Sponge Drops.' Sprinkle pow- 
dered sugar over them, and bake twelve or sixteen minutes 
in a very slow oven. 

Miss Ward^s Sponge Cake. — Break ten eggs into a 
bowl ; add one pound of powdered sugar., and beat to- 
gether for half an hour without stopping. Add half a 
pound of flour., the grated ritid and juice of one lemoji^ 
and a vnneglassful of icine. Bake in deep pans one hour ; 
slowl3' at first, then quicken the fire the last half-hour. 
Sprinkle powdered sugar over the top before baking. 

Angel Cake. — One cup oi flour, measured after one 
sifting, and then mixed with o?\e teaspoonful of crearti. of 
tartar and sifted four times. Beat the \Mtes of elemn 
eggs., with a wire beater or perforated spoon, until stiff and 
flaky. Add one cup and a half oiflne granulated sugar^ 
and beat again ; add one teaspoonful of vcmilla or abnond^ 
then mix in the flour quickly and lightly. Line the bottom 
and funnel of a cake pan with paper not greased, pour in 
the mixture, and bake about forty minutes. When done, 
loosen the cake around the edge, and turn out at once. 
Some persons have been more successful with this cake by 
mixinj? the sugar with the flour and cream of tartar, and 
adding all at once to the beaten egg. 



Angel Cake. 375 



Sunshine Cake. — Make the same as Angel Cake, using 
one teaspoonful of orange extract instead of vanilla, and 
adding the well-beaten yolks of six eggs to the beaten

10 eggs. 



1 pound flour. 

^ wineglass wine. 

3^ wineglass brandy. 



Cream the butter ; add the sugar, yolks of the eggs^ 
wine, brandy, whites of the eggs, and the flour. Put cilt- 
rants into one fourth of the dough, and almonds, blanched 
and pounded in rose water., into another part ; leave the 
remainder plain. Fill very small round tins three quarters 
full. Into half of those containing the plain dough put 
small pieces of citron., three in each, inserting the citron 
upright a little w^a}' into the dough. Sift sugar over the 
tops of those containing the citron and almond before put- 
ting them into the oven. Bake twenty minutes. Frost 
the plain and currant cakes. Pound cake is lighter when 
baked in small cakes than in loaves.

the currants (see page 435) ; cut the citron in uniform 
slices, about one eighth of an inch thick ; blanch the 
almonds and chop fine. Mix all the fruit but the citron 
with enough of the flour to coat it thoroughly. Mix 
the spices with the sug-ar. Cream the butter ; add the 
sugar, beaten 3'olks, beaten whites, lemon rind and juice, 
brand}^ flour, and fruit, except the citron. Put a layer 
of dough half an inch deep in the pan, then spread evenly 
with the citron, then another layer of dough and citron ; 
repeat till the materials are all used. Have dough for the 
top layer. As this cake does not rise much in baking, the 
pans m2ij be at least two thirds full. Bake in two large, 
deep, oblong pans three hours, in a moderate oven. 

Frosting. 

Plain Frosting. — White of one egg^ one teaspoonful 
oflemonjuice^ and one scant cup of poioclered sugar. Put 
the egg and lemon juice in a bowl, and stir the sugar in 
gradually. Then beat, not stir, all together five minutes. 

Boiled Icing. — One cup of granulated sugar., one third 
of a cup of boiling water ^ lohite of one egg^ and one salt- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Boil the sugar and water 
without stirring, until the syrup taken up on a skewer will 
"thread" or "rope." When it is nearly at that point, 
beat the egg stiff", add the cream of tartar, and pour the 
boiling sjTup over the Qgg in a fine stream, beating well. 
When it thickens and is perfectlj^ smooth, pour it over the 
cake. It hardens quickl}^, and should be put on the cake 
before it stiffens enough to drop. 

Golden Frosting. — Beat the yoXks of eggs and stir in 
poiodered sugar till stiff" enough to spread, not to run. 
Flavor with vanilla or wine. 

Ornamental Frosting. — Whites of three eggs., three 
cups of coiifectioner'' s sugar., sifted, and three teaspoo7i^ 
fuls of lemon juice. Put the eggs in a large bowl ; 
sprinkle with three teaspoonfuls of the sugar. Boat with 
a perforated wooden spoon, adding three teaspoonfuls of 



Froiting. 



385 



sugar every five minutes. When it begins to thicken add 
the lemon juice and beat as before. It should thicken by 
the beating of the egg, and not by the addition of too much 
sugar. Do not use all the measure of sugar unless needed. 
Beat with a long flop, over and over, and never stir. When 
stiff enough to leave a " clean cut," or not to run together 
when cut with a knife, spread a thin layer of frosting on 
the cake, and when this is hard put on another layer a 
quarter of an inch thick. When this is firm, mark it for 
cutting. To the remainder of the frosting add sugar more 
rapidl}', until it begins to harden on the spoon and bowl. 
Put a confectioner's tube into the end of a pastry bag, fill 
the bag with frosting, twist the end tightl}^, and press the 
frosting through the tube on the cake in any design you 
wish. 

PinJc Frosting. — Color a portion of the Ornamental 
Frosting with cochineal, adding it slowly till of the desired 
shade. 

Chocolate Frosting. — Melt a square of chocolate in a 
saucepan, and add to the Ornamental Frosting, using 
enough to color light or dark as you prefer. 

Orange Frosting. — Grate the thin rind of an orange, 
and soak it half an hour in three or four teaspoonfuls of 
the orange juice. Then squeeze the juice through a fine 
cloth, and use the same as lemon juice in Ornamental 
Frosting.

open for half an hour. Then brown slightly. Put two 
together ; or put them on the paper in oblong shape, dry 
one hour, brown, remove the soft part, and fill with whipped 
cream. 

To make these successfull}', the stead}', moderate heat 
of a confectioner's brick oven is essential. It is a waste ot 
tune and material to attempt them in an ordinar}^ stove 
oven. 

Macaroons. 

Half a pound of almonds., blanched, dried, and pounded 
to a paste, with 07ie teaspoonfid of rose water. Beat to- 
gether the whites of three eggs^ and half a cup oi powdered

teaspoonfid of almond essence^ then add the pounded 
almonds and, if too soft to be shaped, add one tablespoon- 
fid of flour. Roll with wet hands into balls the size of 
walnuts, flatten them slightty, and place some distance 
apart on buttered paper. Bake slowl}'. 

Almond paste, ready for use, may be obtained at a con- 
fectioner's. Break it up with a fork, add the beaten whites 
and sugar, using four or five eggs for half a pound of 
paste. Drop by teaspoonfuls on paper, and bake as 
above.

stirring all the time. When it hardens in cold water, pour 
it into shallow pans, and as it cools cut in small squares. 



Fresh Fruit. 391 



FRUIT. 

It would be a great saving of time and work, give a 
pleasing variety to bills of fare, and be above all a great 
promoter of health, if people would use ripe fruit abun- 
dantly in its season at their tables (not between meals) . 
With the markets bountifull}' supplied with many varieties 
of fruit, it is to be regretted that it cannot be found at 
ever}' table at least once a day. Much of the money spent 
for some kinds of meat would be better expended for fruit. 
A simple course of fruit is all that is needed after a dinner, 
and is much more wholesome than pies. But it is so hard 
for some people to break away from old customs that it 
will be long before housekeepers generall}' will be content 
to serve the queen of all fruits, the apple, in its natural 
state instead of making it into the " persistent pie," over 
the preparation of which many women toil, for naught save 
the fear that the}' may be considered shiftless if they 
have n't a pie in the house. 

Eipe fruit is especially appropriate at the breakfast- 
table, and may be taken before or after the principal 
dishes, according to individual needs and taste. Some peo- 
ple require the acid of oranges or grapes before they can 
eat anything substantial ; others might be made ill by their 
use at that time, but be benefited by them afterwards. 

All fruit should be served as fresh and cold as possible. 
A dish of fruit which has been kept from day to da}' in a 
warm room may answer for an ornament, but it is not 
tempting to the palate. Only sound, fresh fruit should 
appear at the table. 

Aj-yj^les for table use should have a pleasant spicy flavor, 
not too acid, and should be wiped clean, or poUshed if you 
prefer the street-vender's style. 



392 The Boston Cook Book. 

Oranges may be served whole or cut. Manj' slice them 
across the sections ; but the presence of the seeds and tough 
inner skin is objectionable. A better way is to remove all 
the rind and white skin, divide into sections, then with the 
point of a silver fruit-knife cut off the inner skin in the 
middle, slip out the seeds, and cut each section into three 
pieces. Never serve with the seeds left in, nor sweeten 
until just before serving. A neat way to peel an orange 
is to cut the rind from the ends and leave a strip round 
the middle, then open, leaving the sections on the strip 
of peel. Or cut the oranges in halves crosswise without 
peeling, sprinkle with sugar, and eat with a spoon. 

Grapes^ Malagas especially, should be carefully rinsed in 
cold water, then drained. Fruit scissors should be used to 
divide the clusters. 

Bananas may be served whole, or sliced and slightly 
sweetened or salted. 

Peaches should have the w^ool wiped off, or if pared and 
quartered should be sprinkled with fine granulated sugar, 
and served at once. 

Strawberries, if gritt}', should be rinsed and drained, 
then hulled, and not sweetened till served. Large selected 
berries may be served with the stems on. Pass sugar with 
them, that those who prefer may roll them in it. 

Currants should be sweetened, and large whole clusters 
may be served on the stem. Currants and raspberries are 
delicious when served together. 

Watermelons should be served very cold. Cut off a 
slice at each end, that each half may stand upright. Serve 
the core only, taking it out with a tablespoon in cone- 
shaped pieces. Other melons should have the seeds re- 
moved before serving, be cut in halves, a lump of ice in 
each, and served with sugar or salt. 

Pineapples. — Pare, remove the e3'es, and cut in thin 
slices ; then remove the fibrous centre, and serve in shoes, 
or cut the tender parts into small pieces and sweeten to 
taste. Or pare and pull oft' the tender part with a fork, as 
directed for preserved pineapple. 



Stewed and Baked Fruits. 393 

Iced Fruits. — Dip selected fruit into the white of egg 
slightly beaten, then roll in fine granulated sugar. Dry, 
and serve very cold. 

Whole fruit should be served in a high dish, garnished 
with green leaves, flowers, or vines, and, with a tasteful 
combination of colors, arranged in a convenient wa}' for 
serving. 

Nuts should be cracked, and served with salt. 

Almo7ids and other nuts having a tough inner skin 
should be blanched. 

Raisins. — Use onl}' choice varieties, and serve with 
nuts. 



Tropical Snow. 



8 sweet oranges. 
1 cocoanut, grated. 
6 red bananas. 



1 glass sherry wine, or 
3^^ cup lemon juice. 
Powdered sugar to taste. 



Peel the oranges, divide into sections,, and remove the 
seeds and tough membrane. Put a layer of orange in the 
bottom of a glass dish, pour over it a little wine or lemon 
juice, and strew with powdered sugar ; add cocoanut, and 
then the banana cut in thin slices ; repeat the process, 
using orange, cocoanut, banana, etc., as before. The top 
lajTr is to be heaped high in the centre, and sprinkled 
thickly with cocoanut and powdered sugar, and garnished 
around the base with slices of banana. 

Other combinations of fruit maj^ be arranged to suit the 
taste ; and cocoanut cakes or macaroons., crumbled, or a 
meringue of ichite of egg and sugar., may take the place 
of the grated cocoanut. 

Stewed and Baked Fruits. 

The simplest forms of cooking fruit are stewing and 
baking. Onl}' a small amount of sugar is needed, and it 
is not well to prepare a large quantit}' at a time, as stewed 
fruits do not keep long. In cooking fruit always use porce- 
lain or granite kettles, earthen dishes, wooden spoons, and 



394 The Boston Cook Book, 

silver knives, and pare just before cooking, that the deli- 
cate flavor of the fruit ma}' be preserved, and its attractive 
appearance not impaired hy discoloration. 

Stewed Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and quarter six or 
eight tart apples. Make a sjTup with one cup of sugar., 
two thirds of a cup of water., and a little lemon peel. 
When boiling, add the apples, and cook carefully two or 
three minutes, till thej' are just tender, but not broken. 
Remove them carefull}', boil the s^rup down a little, and 
strain it over the apples. Cook them in granite or porcelain 
pans, and use a wooden spoon. 

Compjote of Apples. — Make a s3-rup with one cup of 
sugar., one cup of icater^ and a square-inch of stick cin- 
namon. Boil slowl}' for ten minutes, skimming well. 
Core and pare eight or ten tart apples ; cook till nearly 
done in the sj'rup. Drain, and cook them a few minutes 
in the oven. Boil the syrup till almost like a jell}'. Ar- 
range the apples on a dish for serving. Fill the core 
cavities with jelly or marmalade. Pour the syrup over 
them. Put v^liipped cream around the base, and garnish 
the cream y^iWh jelly. 

Baked Apples. — Core and pare sour apples. Put them 
in a shallow earthen dish, fill the cavities with sugar ^ 
mixed with grated lemon rind ; add water to cover the 
bottom of the dish. Bake in a ver}- quick oven till soft, 
basting often with the syrup. 

Quinces ma}^ be baked in the same wa}', adding a little 
more water, as the}' require a longer time for baking. 
When eaten hot with butter and sugar ^ they are delicious. 

iVo. 2. — Fill a deep pudding-dish with apples, pared, 
cored, and quartered. For tico quarts add one cup> of 
sugar and one cup of water. Bake, closely covered, in a 
very moderate oven several hours, or till dark red. 

Baked Pears. — Hard pears, or "windfalls," are deli- 
cious pared and baked as in the preceding receipt. When 
done, and still hot, they may be sealed in Mason's jars, 
and will keep indefinitely. By preparing one large dishful 
every day during the pear season, a supply of wholesome 



Jellies, 395 



sauce may be easily obtained from fruit that is often 
left to waste ou the ground. 

Steamed lihubarb. — Wash and cut the rhubarb into 
inch pieces without peeling. Put it into a granite double 
boiler, add one cup of sugar for a pint ot fruit, and cook 
till the rhubarb is soft. Do not stir it. When the rhu- 
barb is very sour, steam it without sugar until the juice 
flows, then drain it, add the sugar, and steam again till 
the sugar is dissolved. Or pour boiling water over it 
and let it stand five minutes, then drain and steam. 

Stewed Prunes. — Wash carefully, and if hard and dry 
soak an hour before cooking. Put them into a porcelain 
kettle, with boiling water to cover them. Boil, closely 
covered, from five to ten minutes, or until swollen and 
tender. Then add one tahlespoonful of sugar for one pint 
of prunes^ and boil a few moments longer, but not enough 
to break them. Use onl}^ the best selected prunes. If 
they lack flavor, add a little lemoix juice. 

Cranherries. — Put three pints of washed cranberries in 
a granite stewpan. On top of them put three cups of gran- 
ulated sugar and three gills of icater. After they begin 
to boil cook them ten minutes, closel}^ covered, and do not 
stir them. Remove the scum. The}' will jell}- when cool, 
and the skins will be soft and tender. 

N'o. 2. {Miss Ward.) — Equal measure of cranberries 
and sugar. Wash, drain, put in a porcelain kettle with 
cold water to just show among the berries when they are 
pressed down. When they boil add a quarter of the sugar. 
Sprinkle it over the berries without stirring. Let it boil 
again a minute, add another quarter, etc., till all the sugar 
is in. Boil up once more, and turn out. Boil slowly, and 
do not stir. This method is preferred by those who like a 
very rich sweet sauce. 



Jellies. 



Jellies are made of equal parts of clear fruit juice and 
sugar. Ap>ples, currants^ quinces., grapes, and barberries 
are the fruits usually used. Loio blackberries and sioamp 



39^ The Boston Cook Book, 

hfuckleberries make delicious jell3\ Crab apples and quinces 
will form jellj^ easilj- ; but grapes are unreliable, and cur- 
rants, if not gathered at the proper time, will sometimes 
fail. Cherries and some other fruits require the addition 
of gelatine. Berries, currants, and grapes require no 
water. Simply mash them in their own juice. Apples, 
peaches, and quinces should be stewed in as little water as 
possible, then mashed, and the juice strained. The juices 
of fruits contain a gelatinous substance called pectose, or 
pectic acid, which is soluble in the fruit juice, but has the 
property of coagulation when mixed with sugar, exposed 
to a slight heat, and then cooled. Sometimes the heat of 
the sun is sufficient, but usually a short but more intense 
heat is necessar}-. When the sugar has a bluish tinge, or 
when there is not enough sugar to absorb the water in the 
juice, or when the juice is unusually watery, as when the 
fruit is over- ripe, and the fruit is boiled a long time to evap- 
orate this water, the mixture loses its gelatinous properties 
and becomes gumnw, or, as disconsolate housekeepers say, 
"will not jelly." 

Currant Jelly. — Currants should not be over-ripe, nor 
gathered after a rain, as then they are too water}'. In 
New England currants are in the best condition about

not squeeze them, or the jelly will be cloudy. In the 
morning measure a bowl of sugar for each bowl of juice,

twenty minutes, and skim thoroughly. Add the hot

days, then cover with paper dipped in brand}', and paste 
paper over the top of the glass. 

One who is authorit}' on this subject recommends cov- 
ering with melted paraffine, or putting a lump of paraffine 
on the jelly while still hot ; then no paper is needed. If 
one can be sure of several sunny dajs, and a perfectly 
dr}- place in which to keep jellies, they may' be made 
without boiling. Mix the sugar with an equal weight of 
currant juice, and stir till dissolved. Fill the glasses and 
keep in the sun till dry. 

After draining the juice the currants may be squeezed, 
and a second quality of jelly made. It ma}' not be clear, 
but answers for some purposes. 

Crab-^l^ple^ 'Wild-Apple^ or Porter- Apjple Jdly. {3Iiss 
Harriott T. Ward.) — Wash the fruit ; cut into pieces, 
but do not pare, nor remove the seeds ; barely cover with 
cold water. Boil and mash them until soft. Then drain 
on a sieve. Use the juice only, and do not squeeze the 
fruit. Boil the juice with an equal quantit}- of sugar, 
until it jellies. Peach jelly is made in the same manner. 

Quince Jelly. — Wipe the fruit carefulh', and remove 
all the stems, and parts not fair and sound. Use the 
best parts of the fruit for canning or preserving, and the 
skin, cores, and hard parts for jell}'. The seeds contain a 
large portion of gelatinous substance. Boil all together, 
in enough water to cover, till the pulp is soft. Mash, and 
drain. Use the juice only, and when boiling add an equal 
weight of hot sugar, and boil till it jelUes in the spoon. 

Grape Jelly. — Select the grapes when not fully ripe. 
Wash and drain, then put them in a preservnng-kettle, 
mash well, and heat till all the skins are broken and the 
juice flows freely. Strain, and use the juice only with an 
equal weight of sugar, as for Currant Jelly. 



Marmalade. 

This is made of the pulp of fruits with the juice, unless 
that has been used for jelly. When fruit is not abundant, 



398 The Boston Cook Booh 

it is well to make marmalade at the same time with jellies, 
especially from peaches, quiuces, and grapes. After drain- 
ing, rub the fruit pulp through a sieve, add an equal weight 
of sugar, and boil very slowly half or three quarters of an 
hour. Stir often to prevent burning. 

Preserves. 

These are usuall}^ prepared with equal weights of sugar 
and fruit. Although too rich for dail}' use, there are 
man}^ people who prefer them to the canned fruit, and 
there are some fruits which are better with the full weight 
of sugar. The fruit should be ripe, fresh, and perfect^ 
sound. The following rules illustrate the best methods 
for the difterent varieties of fruit. 

Beaches. — Pare the peaches ; or remove the skins b}- 
plunging the peaches into boiling 13'e (two gallons of water 
and one pint of wood ashes) . When the skins will slip 
easily, take the peaches out with a skimmer and plunge 
them into cold water ; rinse in several waters, and there 
will be no taste of the lye. Weigh, and add three fourths 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Halve them, 
and use some of the pits, or leave them whole as you 
please. The stones improve the flavor. Make a S3Tup 
by adding as little water as possible to the sugar, — 
about one cupful to each pound of sugar. When it 
boils, skim till clear, then add the peaches, and cook until 
transparent. 

Brandy Beaches. — Prepare the peaches as above, and 
use half a cup of the best brandy to every pound of fruit. 
Add the brandy just as the syrup is taken from the fire. 
Some people prefer the 3^ellow peaches, but white-fleshed 
freestone peaches have a delicious flavor. 

Damsons and Greengages should be pricked in man}^ 
places with a large needle, to prevent the skins from 
bursting. Or scald them and remove the skins, as some- 
times they harden in cooking. Prepare the syrup as for 
peaches. Cook only a few at a time, that the}' maj- not 
be broken. On three successive mornings pour off" the 



Preserves. 399 



S3'rup, and boil it gently for ten minutes. This will 
thoroughh' cook the fruit, without destroj'ing the shape. 

Preserved Quinces. — Use the orange quinces. Wipe, 
pare, quarter, and remove all the core and the hard part 
under the core. Take an equal weight of sugar. Cover 
the quinces with cold water. Let them come slowly to a 
boil. Skim, and when nearly soft put one quarter of the 
sugar on the top, but do not stir. When this boils, add 
another part of the sugar, and continue until all the sugar 
is in the kettle. Let them boil slowl}' until the color you 
like, either light or dark. 

Another way is to cook the quinces in water till ten= 
der, drain, and put them in a stone jar in layers, with an 
equal weight of sugar. Cover closelj'. In a cold dr}' 
place the}' will keep perfectly. They are lighter-colored 
and more tender than when cooked in the sjTup. Watch 
them during the first month, and if there be any signs of 
fermentation, set the jar in a kettle of hot water till the 
fruit is scalded. Reserve the broken or unshapely pieces 
of quince, cut them in small cubes, and use with Strawberry 
Tomatoes. Allow three quarters of a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. Make the s}' rup, and cook the fruit in it 
till tender. Skim it out, and boil the sjTup down for ten 
minutes. Fill the jars, and seal at once. Equal parts of 
siceet apple., cooked with the quince but with no extra sugar, 
can scarcely be distinguished from the quince. 

Preserved Pineapple. — Remove the skin and all the 
ej^es, take the pineapple in your kft hand, and with a sil- 
ver fork begin at the stem end of the fruit and fork out 
small bits. This will leave the core, which is juiceless 
and tasteless, in 3'our hand. Weigh the pineapple after it 
is thus prepared, and sprinkle over it three quarters of a 
pound of sugar to one pound of pineapple. When a 
s3Tup is formed, cook the apple slowlv in it until trans- 
parent, then remove the fruit and boil the syrup a little 
longer. Or slice the pineapple in half-inch slices, and cut 
out the core. Cook in the syrup, being careful not tp 
break the slices. 



400 The Boston Cook Book. 

Preserved Strawberries^ Raspberries^ Currants^ Black- 
berries^ and Cherries. — Measure a bowl of fruit and the 
same quantity of sugar. Put in a preserving-kettle, over 
night, a la^'er of fruit, and then one of sugar. In the 
morning cook slowl}' without stirring, until the liquid is 
clear and the fruit soft. Skim thoroughl}^ before putting 
into the jars. Cherries should be stoned. The pits may 
be used if the flavor be desired. 

No. 2. — Use only large and selected fruit, and allow 
one cup of sugar to a pint jar of fruit. Pick over the 
fruit, and put at once into the jars, with as little hand- 
ling as possible, and sprinkle each layer with sugar. Place 
the jars in a boiler of water, and let the water boil ten 
minutes. Have a little syrup boiling, and fill each jar to 
the brim with the boiling sjTup, and seal at once. 

Jams. 

Jams are made with whole small fruits, or large fruit cut 
fine, and cooked in an equal weight of sugar. 

Grape Jam. — Wash the grapes, and squeeze or pinch 
the pulp from the skins. Boil the pulp until it separates 
from the seeds, and rub it through a sieve. Then add the 
skins to the pulp, and boil with an equal weight of sugar 
fifteen minutes. Put into small jars or tumblers, and cover 
with paper. 

Currant^ Raspberry., or Blackberry Jam. — Pick over 
and mash the fruit ; allow one pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit. Put the fruit and one quarter of the sugar into 
a granite or porcelain kettle ; when boiling, add another 
quarter of the sugar ; boil again, add more sugar, and 
when all is used, let it boil till it hardens on the spoon 
in the air. 

Apples^ pears ^ peaches^ and quinces should be pared, 
cut small, and treated in the same wa3\ Cooking in only 
a little sugar at a time prevents the fruit from becoming 
hard. 



Canning. 40: 



Canniiig. 

Canning differs from preserving in that the fruit is kept, 
either with or without sugar, b}^ sealing in air-tight jars or 
cans, and is not cooked long enough to destro}' its natural 
flavor. Some authorities state that fruit ma}' be kept by 
putting it in the jars, filling with cold water, and sealing 
immediateh'. But nearl}' all fruits are improved b}' the 
addition of more or less sugar. As a rule, all fruits that 
require sugar when fresh require it when canned. 

The important points in canning are to have the fruit 
perfect in shape and quality ; the syrup clear, rightlv pro- 
portioned, and boiling hot ; the jars hot and filled to over- 
flowing, and sealed quickly and thoroughly, that no air 
may be left inside. Have all utensils in order and at 
hand, that there ma}^ be no needless dela}'. Large-mouthed 
glass jars with glass covers or porcelain-lined screw covers 
are the best. Pint jars are more convenient for a small 
familj'. The}' should be scalded, and the covers and rub- 
bers clean and perfectly' fitted. Keep the jars in hot water 
until ready to fill, or roll each one in hot water just before 
filling, or place them in a folded towel wrung out of hot 
water, and put a silver spoon or fork in the jar while 
fllhng. A clamp is a great convenience, as the jar may 
be held in the clamp directly over the kettle and filled very 
quicldy. If without this, have a broad shallow pan, half 
filled with hot water, on the stove or on a table near by, 
and place the jars in it while filling them. A wide-mouthed 
tunnel aids in filling the jars. When the fruit is to be boiled 
in the jars, place a perforated tin or some fiat stones or 
mufiSn rings in the boiler, to keep the jars from resting on 
the bottom. Then the water will be under as well as 
around the jar, and there will be no danger of breaking. 

All ripe mellow fruit ma}' be prepared and put at once 
into the jars. Place the jars in a boiler or kettle of warm 
water, with something underneath to avoid breaking. 
Make the syrup, using sugar according to taste, or in the 
proportion of one cup of sugar and one cup of water for 

26 



402 The Boston Cook Book. 

each jar o? small juicy berries^ and one cup of sugar and 
two cups of water for pears and large fruits. Pour the 
sj'rup boiling hot into the hot jars, boil five minutes, and 
seal at once. 

Strawberries^ plums^ and cherries will require more 
sugar. Cherries should be stoned, but the stones ma}^ be 
used if liked. 

Quinces^ apples^ hard peaches^ pears^ and fruits which 
require softening, should be cooked in water or in syrup 
until tender. Then fill the jars with boiling sj-rup, strain- 
ing it if not clear. 

Peaches ma}' be canned whole, or if halved, a few oi 
the pits removed and cooked in the syrup to give addi- 
tional flavor. 

Pears should be well ripened and of fine flavor. A taste 
less, insipid pear is onty suitable for sweet pickle. 

Tomatoes should be peeled and cooked till well scalded; 
then salted and sealed at once. 

Always fill to overflowing, using boiling water when 
there is not enough S3^rup. Run the handle of a silver 
tablespoon down the inside of the jar, that the syrup may 
completel}' surround the fruit. Fasten the covers on se- 
curel}^ and give the screw an extra turn ever}' half-hour 
until the fruit is cold. If the jars be kept bottom up and 
in a dark place, there is hardh' a chance of failure. The 
best qualit}' of thick tin-foil may be used as a cover for 
an}' large-mouthed bottle or jar minus a cover. Fill the 
jar with the fruit and s^^rup, cover with a large piece of 
tin-foil, work it down over the rim until perfectl}- smooth 
and tight. If air-tight, there will be a depression in the 
cover as soon as the fruit is cold. Fruit thus covered 
should be kept away from mice, as the}^ will eat the tin- 
foil. 

Canned fruit should be opened some time before using, 
that it may be aerated and the flavor improved. There 
has been a strong feeling against the use of fruit prepared 
in tin cans. Chemists have examined canned fruit as soon 
as opened, and found it harmless ; but if the fruit be left 



Sweet Pickles. 



in the tin can, the action of the air causes the acid in 
fruit to act upon the metal and form a poisonous compou 
Care should be taken to remove the fruit from the can as 
soon as opened. 

^ . Sweet Pickles. 

^ Eight pounds of fruit, four pounds of best hroicn sugar ^ 
Sne quart of vinegar^ and one cup of mixed whole spices^ 
— stick cinnamon^ cassia huds^ cdlspice^ and cloves ; less 
of the latter than of the former. Tie the spices in a bag, 
and boil with the vinegar and sugar. Skim well ; then add 
the fruit. Cook ten minutes, or till scalded and tender. 
Skim out the fruit, and put into stone jars. Boil the S3rup 
five minutes longer, and pour over the fruit. The next 
da3^ pour off the syrup and boil down again, and do 
this for three mornings. Keep the bag of spices in the 
syrup. 

Tomatoes. — Scald, remove the skins, and cook without 
breaking if possible. 

Peaches. — Scald or wipe off the " wool," and leave 
them whole. Do not stick them with cloves. If ver}^ 
ripe, merely pour the hot S3'rnp over them on three suc- 
cessive mornings. 

Pears. — Select sound fruit, not too ripe. Pare, and 
leave them whole with the stems on. Cook till tender. 

Pi2^e Cucumber or Watermelon Pind. — Cut the pared 
rind into thick slices. Boil one ounce of cdum in one gcd- 
lon of water ^ pour it on the rinds, and let them stand in it 
several hours on the back of the stove. Take out into 
cold water, and when cold boil them half an hour in the 
3weet pickle. 

Pipe Mushmelon or Canteloupe. — Pare, and cut into 
thick slices. Pour the boiling syrup over them. The 
next morning pour off the S3Tup, boil five minutes, and 
pour it boiling hot over the melon. Repeat this on three 
mornings. 

Pineapple. — Slice it, or with a fork pick it off from 
the centre, in small pieces, and prepare as for melon.

Tomato Catchup. {Mrs. Campbell.} 

Boil 07ie bushel of ripe tomatoes, skins and all, and when 
soft strain through a colander to remove the skins onl}'. 
Mix 0916 cup of salt, two pounds of brown sugar, half an 
ounce of cayenne pepper, three ounces each of ground all- 
spice, mace, and celery seed, tiao ounces oi ground cinna- 
mon, and stir into the tomato. Add two quarts of best 
cider vinegar, and when thoroughl}' mixed strain through 
a sieve. Pour all that runs through into a large kettle, and 
boil slowl}^ till reduced one half. It is an improvement 
to add a pint of brandy ten minutes before the catchup 
is done, but many think it unnecessar3\ Put it in small 
bottles, seal, and keep in a cool, dark place. 

Piccallili, or Chow Chow. 



1 peck green tomatoes. 

1 cup jalt. 

6 small onions. 

1 large head celery. 

2 cups brown sugar. 



1 teaspoonful white pepper. 

1 tablespoonf ul ground cinnamon. 

1 tablespoonful ground allspice. 

1 tablespoonful mustard. 

2 quarts good, sharp vinegar. 



Chop the tomatoes, mix the salt with them thoroughly, 
and let them stand over night. In the morning pour oflf 
the water, and chop the onion and celer3\ Mix the sugar, 
pepper, cinnamon, and mustard. Put in a porcelain kettle 
a layer of tomatoes, onion, celery, and spices, and so on 
until all is used, and cover with the vinegar. Cook slowly 
all day, or until the tomatoes are soft. Cauliflower, or 
cabbage, or one quart of cucumbers may be used with the 
tomatoes. Sliced or grated horseradish gives a pleasant 
flavor. 

Pickled Cucumbers. {Miss Harriott Ward.) 

To one hundred and fifty small-sized cucumbers take 
one pint of salt, dissolved in boiling water to cover them. 
Let them remain in a covered vessel for forty-eight hours. 
Then drain, and wipe each one carefully. Put them in a 
pickle-pot or firkin with one large onion, peeled and

stuck full of cloves, one green pepper, some scraped horse- 
radish^ and a small bit of alum. Boil vinegar enough 
to cover them. Fill a musliu bag with one cup of mixed 
spices, — whole cloves, whole allspice, peppercorns, stick 
cinnamon, white mustard seed, and a flake of mace, and 
boil ten minutes with the vinegar. Put this bag in the 
firkin when 3'ou pour on the boiling vinegar. 

When cucumbers are gathered fresh from the vines 
ever}^ daj', the}' ma}' be kept in brine till wanted. Make 
the brine strong enough to float an egg, — a pint oi coarse 
salt and six quarts of boiling loater, boiled and skimmed 
clear. Pick the cucumbers as the}' ripen, wash carefully 
without removing the prickles, leave a bit of the stem on, 
and keep them covered with the brine. Soak, as required, 
in fresh cold water two days, and pour boiling spiced 
vinegar over them. 



Mixed Pickles. {Mrs. Poor.) 



150 small cucumbers. 
1 quart small martinoes. 
1 quart small button onions. 
1 medium cauliflower. 
Rind of }-2 watermelon. 
3 pints green string beans. 

3 cups salt. 

4 quarts cold water. 

3^ pound horseradish root. 
1 tablespoonful white mustard 
seed. 



1 tablespoonful stick cinnamon, 

broken into half-inch pieces. 
1 tablespoonful whole cloves. 
^2 tablespoonful peppercorns. 
}2 tablespoonful allspice. 
^2 tablespoonful whole mace. 

1 teaspoonful celery seed. 

2 quarts white wine vinegar. 

1 ounce alum. 

2 quarts boiling water. 
1 gill alcohol. 



Wipe the cucumbers and martinoes with a damp cloth. 
Cut the cucumbers lengthwise into quarters, and the mar- 
tinoes into halves. Scald and peel the onions ; wash the 
cauliflower, watermelon rind, and beans ; break the cauli- 
flower into small pieces, and cut the melon rind about 
the size of the pieces of cucumber. Dissolve the salt in 
the cold water. Put the pickles in a large earthen or 
tight wooden vessel, and pour the brine over them ; if they 
are not covered, add more cold water. Put a large earthen 
plate over them, with a clean brick or stone to keep them

under the brine. Let them stand two days, remove them 
from the brine, and wash in cold water. Wash and scrape 
the horseradish root. Pack the pickles in a stone jar or 
firkin. Put all the spices into a bag made of strainer cloth. 
Boil the vinegar, spices, and alum in a porcelain kettle ten 
minutes, skim carefully', add the boiling water, and pour 
innnediately over the pickles. If a stronger spice be 
desired, leave the bag on the top of the pickles. Set them 
in a cold place, with the plate and w^eight over them to 
keep them under the vinegar. In about two weeks add 
the alcohol, and in four weeks the}' will be ready to use. 

Mustard Pickles. {Mrs. John Sheldon.) 

Equal quantities of small cucumbers., the largest ones 
sliced, green tomatoes sliced, cauliflower picked into flow- 
erets, and small button onions. Keep them covered wath 
strong!}' salted water twenty-four hours. In the morning 
scald the brine, and dissolve in it a bit of alum the size of 
a nutmeg. Pour the boiling brine over the pickles. When 
cold, drain thoroughly and prepare as much vinegar as 
there were quarts of brine. To 07ie quart of vinegar 
use one cup of brown sugar ^ half a cup oi flour, and one 
fourth of a pound of ground mustard. Boil the sugar and 
vinegar. Mix the flour and mustard, and stir the boiling 
vinegar into it, and when smooth pour it over the pickles. 

Canned Fruit. {Mrs. John Sheldon.) 

Put the prepared fruit in a jar, and cover with boiling 
syrup sweetened to taste. On three successive mornings 
drain ofl" the syrup, boil again, and pour over the fruit. 
The last morning, let fruit and syrup come just to the boil- 
ing-point, but do not boil ; then seal immediately. Fruit 
prepared in this way has been tested by the author and 
found perfect. Strawberries preserve their shape and 
never ferment. 



Invalid Coohery. 407 



GENERAL HINTS ON CARING- AND 
COOKING- FOR INVALIDS. 



Ventilation. — The first condition of comfort and re- 
covery to the patient is that the room be perfect!}^ ven- 
tilated, either directl3^ or from fresh air in an adjoining- 
room. A sunn}' exposure and an open fire, and in sum- 
mer an open fireplace, are essential aids. After all 
these points are secured, care must be taken that the air 
be not vitiated b}' anything in the room. Growing plants 
are more healthful than cut flowers ; unless the room be 
large and air}^, the latter should not be allowed for any 
length of time, and even then should be removed as soon 
as their freshness is gone. If possible, avoid having a 
kerosene lamp in a sick-room. The odor is irritating to 
the mucous membrane, and in some conditions positively 
harmful. The wick should never be turned below the 
point of free combustion, either in the room of the sick 
or well. If 3'ou wish a dim light, place the lamp outside 
the door, or shade it by a screen. Never turn it down, 
as it will inevitabl}' vitiate the atmosphere. 

Avoid noise in replenishing the fire, by bringing the 
coal in a paper bag, and putting bag and all upon the 
fire. Keep all medicines and everything suggestive of a 
sick-room out of sight. 

The Bed. — Arrange the bed so that the patient may 
be shielded from any draught. Neither sun nor lamp 
light should shine directly in the eyes. Whenever it is 
possible, change the position of the bed, furniture, and 
pictures, that the eye may have something new and inter- 
esting to dwell upon, if such changes interest instead of 



4o8 The Boston Cook Booh. 

distress the invalid. Two small beds, that the patient 
may find relief in change, are desirable ; or, if possible, 
procure an invalid's bed, which admits of many changes of 
position and the airing and changing of the bed with no 
accompanying fatigue. 

Cleanliness, — It is of the first importance that the bed 
linen and clothing of the patient should be kept fresh by 
frequent changes, and thoroughly dried and aired. Be 
careful to supply the needed warmth by light but not over- 
abundant clothing. The patient should be bathed freely ; 
avoid a chill by giving a sponge bath with alcohol and 
w^arm water, exposing only a part of the body at a time to 
the air, and rub till perfectly dry. 

Wet a cotton-flannel bag, made with the nap side out, 
in cold water, wring it slightl}^ and tie it over the broom 
to use in sweeping. Be careful to wash it every time it is 
used. It is quite essential that the floor of a sick-room 
should be kept clean. Remove all dust with a damp 
cloth. The cleansing, dr3'ing, or airing of all objects 
should be done outside of the sick-room. Keep the 
room, the bed, the patient, and ever3^thing about j^ourself 
absolutel}' neat and clean. 

Conversation. — In extreme sickness let no unnecessary 
word be spoken in a sick-room, and no needless, noisy, 
nor abrupt movements be made. Let the voice be calm 
and clear, neither loud nor whispering. In speaking to 
the patient do so in the way that requires the least eflbrt 
in response, and never consult him about his food. Avoid 
all discussions of the disease, the medicine, and any excit- 
ing topic either with or before him. Do not excite the 
patient by needless conversation with the doctor outside of 
the sick-room. Never whisper, even when the patient is 
asleep or in delirium, because a whisper is more j^enetrat- 
ing than a low full tone. During convalescence do not 
wear}^ with conversation ; let it always be bright and cheer- 
ful, and, as far as possible, of things outside the sick-room. 
Cultivate the power of talking to, rather than with, a sick 
person. 



Care of Invalids. 409 



Conveniences in a SicJc-Boom. — "In severe sickness 
a glass tube is useful for feeding drinks and gruels ; and 
little white china boats with spouts are also good. A 
wooden tra}- with legs six or seA-en inches high, to stand 
upon the bed, is ver^' convenient for serving meals." 

To Jveep Ice for a Sick-Boom. — Tie a square of coarse 
white flannel over a pitcher, leaving a cup-shaped depres- 
sion of the flannel in the pitcher. Put broken ice in the 
flannel, and cover it tightly with a thicker flannel. The 
ice will keep all night, and the water may be poured ofi" as 
wanted. 

In appl3'ing hot bandages dip the flannel in boiling 
water, place it in the centre of a coarse towel, and twist 
and wring the ends of the towel ; or place the flannels in a 
steamer over hot water until penetrated with the steam ; 
they will then need no wringing. 

Feeding the Patient. — When feeding the patient, do it 
gentl}^ and neatly. Anticipate his wants, and let the food 
be a surprise as far as practicable. In severe sickness give 
nourishment in a small quantity often^ and never fail to 
give it immediatel}' after a long sleep. During convales- 
cence food should be given at longer, but regular intervals. 
If the patient be unable to use a toothbrush, wet a bit of 
soft cloth and wipe the teeth and gums, and give a little 
water or acid drink to soften the drj- mucous membrane 
and destroy the bad taste in the mouth, before ofl'ering 
an}^ food. 

Let everything prepared for the invalid be arranged to 
please the e3'e as well as the palate. Serve less than 3'ou 
think the patient requires, and give as much variety as 
possible, serving in different forms or in diff'erent dishes 
if the material must be the same. Hot liquids should be 
hot when they reach the patient, not merely when the}' 
leave the kitchen. Serve them in a hot pitcher, and pour 
onl}' a little into the hot cup or bowl, and so avoid its run- 
ning over into the saucer or too rapid cooling. Never 
insult the patient by off'ering him a slice of dough covered 
with charcoal, under the name of toasL When the meal is* 



41 o The Boston Cook Book. 

over, remove immediatelj^ everj^ trace of food from the 
room. Keep in the sick-room choice fruit or an}' deUca- 
cies which have been sent to the patient only long enough 
to gratif}' the e3'e, then remove to a cool place, and serve 
as fresh and daintil}' as possible. 

Wines or liquors of ^uy kind should never be given 
without the advice of a ph3'sician. Young persons do not 
need them, and, in an}' form of fever, stimulants are posi- 
tivel}' harmful. In some extreme cases, among very old 
people, or where there is a great lack of recuperative 
power, they ma}^ be given. 

Yisitors. — Visitors should never be admitted to a sick- 
room, except with the consent of the phj-sician. Never 
visit a sick-room when in a violent perspiration or with 
an empt}' stomach, as then the sj'stem more readily re- 
ceives contagion. If obliged to sit up all night with a 
patient, provide yourself with something to eat, if nothing 
more than a cake of chocolate, that there may be no 
needless exhaustion. 

Not the least of the man}" qualifications desirable in a 
good nurse is a thorough knowledge of the nature, use, and 
digestibihty, as well as the best methods of preparing dif- 
ferent kinds of food, and of their adaptation to different 
forms of disease. Such knowledge is of still greater im- 
portaiice to every physician, and fully as essential as the 
study of drugs. Nurses, alas ! are often wholly unquali- 
fied, or not to be obtained at all ; and then that patient 
is fortunate, indeed, who has a physician who can in 
emergency fill the treble oflSce of nurse, cook, and doctor. 

Diet for the Invalid. 

First Condition. — Sometimes the system from over- 
taxation, either mental or physical, needs a period of 
complete rest or comparative inaction ; or, as in the com- 
mencement of many forms of sickness, the diet should be 
food which merely satisfies the hunger and which soothes 
and reduces inflammation and quenches thirst, but does

not nourish nor stimulate. Foods proper at such times 
come under the head of starchy gruels, gelatinous soups 
and jellies, oranges, grapes, etc., and mucilaginous, acid, 
and aromatic drinks. 



Flour or Arrowroot Gruel. 

1 cup boiling water. I 2 teaspoonfuls flour, wet in cold 

1 saltspoonful salt. | water. 

Cornstarch and rice-flour gruels are made in a similar 
manner. Use a little more of wheat flour than of the 
others. 

Mix the flour and salt, and make into a smooth thin 
paste with cold water, then stir it into the boihng water. 
Cook five minutes, or until the desired consistencj- is ob- 
tained. Strain : then add sugar ^ if preferred, and thin 
with a little milk. If intended for a fever patient, a little 
lemon juice improves the flavor ; if for a patient with sum- 
mer complaint, boil with the gruel half an inch stick of 
cinnamon or a little nutmeg^ — the spice will help to re- 
duce the laxative condition. Sick people soon tire of 
sweets, and gruels should be sweetened only slighth', if 
at all. Flour and starch}' gi'uels should not be given in 
typhoid fever, or when the disease is located in the intes- 
tines. Xor should they ever be used in excess, as, being 
rapidly swallowed, they are unaflfected by the alkaline 
action of the saliva, and pass through the stomach un- 
changed and severely tax the intestines. They should 
be kept in the mouth and mingled with the saliva before 
swallowinsf. 



2 dozen raisins, quartered. 
2 cups milk. 



1 tablespoonful flour. 
Salt to taste. 



Boil the raisins in a little water twenty minutes. Let 
the water boil away, and add the milk. When boiUng, 
add the flour rubbed to a thin paste with a little cold 
milk. Boil eight or ten minutes. Season with salt and

strain. Or omit the raisins, and add sugar to taste ; 
or add the beaten white of one egg after it comes from 
the stove. 

Barley Gruel. 

Boil one ounce oi pearl barley a few minutes, to cleanse 
it. Pour off the water, add one quart of cold water and 
half a teaspoonful of salt^ and simmer one hour, or until 
reduced one half. Strain it ; sweeten to taste, and add a 
little lemon or nutmeg^ if desired. Barle}" contains muci- 
lage, and is soothing and refreshing in fevers and gastric 
inflammation. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

1 tablespoonful flour. I 1 teaspoonful salt. 

2 tablespoonf uls corn meal. | 1 quart boiling water. 

Mix the flour, meal^ and salt. Make into a thin paste 
with a little cold water, and stir into the boiling water. 
Boil thirty minutes, stirring often ; thin with milh or 
cream. Milk ma}^ be used instead of water by mak- 
ing the gruel in a double boiler. Indian meal gruel 
requires longer time for cooking than an}' purely' starchy 
gruels. 

No. 2. — Wet one heaping teaspoonful of meal and 
one saltspoonful of salt in a little cold water, and stir into 
one c}ip> of boiling water. Boil slowly thirty' minutes. 

Indian corn meal is heating in its nature, and should 
never be given where there is an}' inflammatory condition 
of the S3'stem. If given during convalescence after scarlet 
fever, it sometimes produces glandular swellings. "When 
there is a deficiency of natural warmth, and no inflamma- 
tion, it may be given without harm. 

Oatmeal Gruel. 

2 tablespoonf uls oatmeal. I 1 quart boiling water. 

}/^ teaspoonful salt. | 

Boil one hour. Strain, and serve with milk or crexim. 



Gruels. 413 



No, 2. — Pound half a cup of coarse oatmeal until it is 
mealy. Put it in a tumbler, and fill the tumbler with cold 
water. Stir well ; let it settle ; then pour off the mealy 
water into a saucepan. Fill again, and pour off the water, 
and again repeat this, being careful each time not to dis- 
turb the sediment in the bottom of the tumbler. Then boil 
the water twenty minutes. Add one saltspoonful of salt. 
If ver}^ thick, add a little cream or milk. Strain and serve 
hot. Beef essence or beef tea may be used in place of cream. 
This is the most palatable and convenient way of making 
gruel from oatmeal. 

Farina Gruel. 

1 tablespoonful Hecker's farina. I 1 cup boiling water. 

1 saltspoonful salt. | 1 cup milk. 

Put all but the milk in the double boiler, and cook fifteen 
minutes, or until it thickens, then add the milk and boil 
again. Sweeten to taste. 

Farina is a granulated preparation of the inner portion 
of the finest wheat, freed from bran and floury dust. It 
contains nitrogenous or flesh-forming material, is easily 
digested, and is a more nutritive food for invalids and 
children than cornstarch, sago, arrowroot, or tapioca, 
which contain only starch. 

Cracker Gruel. 

4 tablesp. powdered cracker. I 1 cup milk. 

1 cup boiling water. j 1^ teaspoonful salt. 

Boil up once and serve. 

Egg Gruel. 

1 egg (yolk beaten well). I 1 cup hot milk. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. J White of egg, beaten till foamy 

Flavor with nutmeg or lemon. Good for a violent cold, 
if taken very hot after retiring. 



414 The Boston Cook Book, 



Panada, No. 1. 



1 cup stoned raisins. 

1 quart water. 

2 slices toasted bread, or 



1 cup bread crumbs. 

2 eggs. 

1 tablespoonful sugar. 



Boil the raisins one hour. Skim out the raisins, and 
add the bread to the boiling water ; boil fifteen minutes, 
stirring well. Beat the eggs, add the sugar, and pour the 
panada over them, stirring all the time. 

iVo. 2. — Split tioo Boston or Graham crackers. Put 
them into a bowl, sprinkle with sugar and salt^ and cover 
with boiling water. Set the bowl in a pan of boiling 
water for half an hour, or until the crackers are clear. 
Slide them out into a hot saucer, and serve very hot with 
sugar and cream. 

JVo. 3. — Boil one tablespoonful of cracker crumbs five 
minutes in one cup of boiling water., slightly sweetened^ 
salted^ and flavored with lemon. 

Oatmeal Mush for Children or Invalids. 

1 cup granulated oatmeal. I 1 scant quart boiling water. 

3^ teaspoonf ul salt. | 

Put the meal and salt in the double boiler, pour on the 
boiling water, and cook two or three hours. Remove 
the cover just before serving, and stir with a fork to let the 
steam escape. If the water in the lower boiler be strongly 
salted, the meal will cook more quickty. Serve with sugar ^ 
or salt^ and cream. Baked sour apples., apple sauce., and 
apple jelly are delicious eaten with the oatmeal. They 
should be served with the mush, and the cream and sugar 
poured over the whole. They give the acid flavor which 
so many crave in the morning. 

Coarse oatmeal is not suitable for any form of water 
brash, acidity, or bowel irritation. It often causes erup- 
tions on the skin in warm weather. 



Mushes. 415 



Indian Meal Mush. 



1 cup com meal. 
3^ teaspoonf ul salt. 



1 cup cold milk. 
1 pint boiling water. 



Mix the meal and salt with the cold milk. Stir this 
gradually into the boiling water. Cook half an hour in a 
double boiler, stirring often. 

Graham Mush. 

Mix half a cup of Graham Jfour and half a teaspoon- 
fill of salt. Make it into a thin sjuooth paste with a little 
cold loater. Stir it into one pint of boiling loater. Cook 
twenty minutes, stirring often. Serve with cream. 

Rye Mush is made in the same manner, and sometimes 
served with molasses. 

Gluten 3fush. — Use one cup of gluten to one pint of 
hoiling loater^ and cook as above. Being destitute of 
starch, it will not thicken like Rye Mush. 

Brain Food. {Health Food Co.) 

Wet one cup of Brain Food in a little cold water ^ and 
stir it into one quart of salted boiling loater. Cook over 
hot water one to two hours. Eat, hot or cold, with sugar 
and cream. 

Rice Water or Jelly. 

2 tablespoonfuls rice. I Salt and sugar to taste. 

1 quart cold water. 1 

Pick over and wash the rice, and cook in water one hour, 
or till the rice is dissolved. Add salt and sugar to taste. 
If intended for jelly, add lemon juice and strain into a 
mould. When cold, serve with sugar and cream. If to 
be used as a drink, add more hot water, enough to make a 
thin liquid, and boil longer. Add half a square inch of 
stick cinnamon., and strain. Serve hot or cold. 

Rice is easily digested and almost wholly assimilated ; 
it is good in diarrhoea or dysenter3\ 



4i6 The Boston Cook Book. 



Tapioca Jelly. 



^ cup pearl tapioca. 
1 pint cold water, 
1 saltspoonf ul salt. 



1 tablespoonful lemon juice. 
1 heaping tablespoonful sugar. 



Pick over and wash the tapioca. Add the cold water, 
and cook in a double boiler until entirel}^ dissolved. Then 
add the salt, lemon juice, and sugar. Turn into a mould. 
Serve with sugar and cream. Half a cup of strawberry^ 
raspberry^ or blackberry jam or currant jelly may be used 
in place of lemons. 

Irish Moss Jelly. 



% cup Irish moss. 
1 pint boiUng water. 



1 lemon, 

3/3 cup sugar. 

Soak the moss in cold water until soft. Pick over and 
wash again. Then put it into the boiling water, and sim- 
mer until it is dissolved. Add the lemon juice and sugar. 
Strain into a mould. Use currant jelly in place of lemon, 
or steep /oz^r or Jive figs with the moss. 

Sea mosses contain bromine and iodine, and are useful 
in rheumatic affections. Iceland moss ma}" be used in the 
same manner. This, when dried, contains more starch 
than potatoes, and more flesh food than oatmeal or corn. 

Restorative Jelly. 



% box gelatine. 
1 cup port wine. 
1 tablesp. powdered gum arable. 



2 tablespoonf uls lemon juice. 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

2 cloves. 



Put all together in a glass jar, and cover closely. Place 
the jar on a trivet in a kettle of cold water. Heat it slowly, 
and when the mixture is dissolved, stir well and strain. 
Pour into a shallow dish, and when cool cut it into small 
squares. This is good for an old person or a very weak 
patient. 

Mutton Broth. 

To make it quickly for an invalid, chop one pound of 
lean juicy mutton very fine ; pour over it one pint of cold

water. Let it stand until the water is ver}^ red, then heat 
it slowl}'. Let it simmer ten minutes. Strain, season, and 
add two tablespoonfuls of soft-boiled rice^ or thicken it 
sUghtly with rice flour wet with cold icciter. Serve hot. 
When given to a person with a severe cold, or a consump- 
tive, the fat should not be removed, as it is soothing to 
the chest, and when absorbed by the rice or some starch\' 
material is not uninviting to the eye. For a fever patient, 
tne fat should be removed. When you have not time to 
cool the broth, a piece of soft tissue paper passed over the 
surface helps to take up any globules of fat which will 
not come off with a spoon. 

Barley Soup. 

Remove the fat and bones from one 2:)07ind of the yiecJc of 
mutton. Cut the meat into dice, and add to it one table- 
spoonful of 'well-ioashed barley and one jjiiit of cold water. 
Heat slowly, and simmer two hours. Put the bones into 
one cup of cold water ^ and boil gently half an hour. Then 
strain into the meat and barley. Season with scdt. Skim 
off the fat, and serve with whole-wheat or gluten wafers. 



Calves'-Foot Jelly or Broth. 



4 calves' feet. 

4 quarts cold water. 

1 cup sugar. 

2 lemons. 



2 inch stick cinnamon. 
1 inch blade mace. 

3 eggs (whites and shells). 
1 pint wine. 



Scald the feet, and clean thoroughly-. Split, break the 
bones, and put them into the cold water. Heat slowly, 
and simmer gently until reduced to three pints. Strain, 
and when cool remove the fat. Add the other ingredients 
except the wine. Put it over the fire, and stir until hot. 
Let it boil five minutes, or till a thick scum has formed. 
Set it back on the stove ; skim, and add the wine. Strain 
through a fine napkin into a shallow dish. When ready to 
serve, cut it into blocks, or break it up lightly with a fork. 
If intended for broth, simply remove the fat, season to

taste, and stir it into a beaten egg ; or add sago or tapi- 
oca^ having first soaked and boiled it till soft. Veal broth 
is not ver^' palatable in itself; and as it does not contain 
the nutritive qualities of beef or mutton broth, it is not 
well to use it in the sick-room except for a variet}'. 

Chicken Jelly or Broth. 

Clean a small chicken. Disjoint and cut the meat into 
half-inch pieces. Remove all the fat. Break or pound the 
bones. Dip the feet into boiling water, and scald until the 
skin and nails will peel off. The feet contain gelatine, and 
when well cleaned may be used for jelly. Cover the meat, 
feet, and bones with cold water ; heat verv slowh', and sim- 
mer till the meat is tender. Strain, and when cool remove 
the fat. Season with salty pepper.^ and lemon^ and add the 
shell and ii^hite of one egg. Put it over the fire, and stir 
well until hot. Let it boil five minutes. Skim, and strain 
through a fine napkin. Pour it into small cups, and cool 
it if intended for jelh'. When the patient can take it, 
small dice of the breast meat may be moulded in the jell3\ 
Serve hot, without clearing, if intended for broth. 

Beef Jelly or Broth. 

Prepare the same as for Bouillon (page 131). If in- 
tended for jelly, clear it as directed for Clear Soup. 

Barley Water. 



1 tablespoonful pearl barley. 
3 blocks sugar. 



lo lemon. 

1 quart boiling water. 



Wash the barle}' in cold water, then pour ofl^ the water, 
and put the barley, sugar, and lemon into the boiling water, 
and let it stand covered and warm for three hours ; then 
strain it. Currant jelly or orange juice may be used in- 
stead of lemon. This is a valuable demulcent in colds, 
affections of the chest, hectic fever, strangur}- and other 
diseases of the bladder or urinary organs.

Gum Water. 

1 ounce clean gum arable, and I 1 pint boiling water. 

)o ounce sugar, dissolved in | 1 lemon (juice). 

When dissolved, add the lemon juice, and strain through 
a fine strainer. This is soothing in inflammation of the 
mucous membrane. 

Toast Water. — Toast one pint of lohite or brown bread 
C7'usts very brown, but be careful not to burn them ; add 
o?ie pint of cold ivater ; let it stand for one hour, then 
strain, and add cream and sugar to taste. The nourish- 
ment in the bread is easily absorbed when taken in this 
liquid form. 

Crust Coffee. — Pour one pint of boiling loater over 
two slices of broion toast. Steep ten minutes, and strain. 
Add sugar 2i\\d cream to taste. 

Corn Tea and Rice Coffee. — Brown one cup of dried 
sweet corn or rice. Pound or grind it fine. Add 07ie pi?it 
of cold icater^ and steep it one hour. Strain, and serve 
with sugar and cream. These are pleasant and nourishing 
beverages. 

Slip2)ery-Elm Tea. — Pour one cup of boiling water 
upon one teaspoonfid of slippery-ehn poicder or a piece 
of the bark. When cool, sti'ain and flavor with lemon 
juice and sugar. This is soothing in any inflammation 
of the mucous membrane. 

Acid Fruit Drinks. 

Pour boiling water on mashed cranberries.^ barberries., 
or iDliortleberries. When cold, strain, and sweeten to taste. 

iVo. 2. — Stir a tablespoonful of any acid jelly or fruit 
syrup into one tumbler of ice icater. 

No. 3. — Dissolve one tablespoonful of cream of tartar 
in one pint of loater. Sweeten to taste. 

Apptle Tea. — - Roast tico large sour apples, cover with 
boiling vKiter ; when cool, pour oflT the water and strain. 
Add sugar to taste- 



420 The Boston Cook Booh 

Jelly and Ice. — With a large needle or pin, chip half a 
oup of ice into bits as large as a pea. Mix with it about 
the same quantit}^ of lemon,, currant^ blackberry ^ or bar- 
berry jelly. Very refreshing in fevers. 

Tamarind Water. — Boil tico ounces of tamarinds with 
/our ounces of sto?ied raisins in three pints of loater for 
one hour. Strain and cool. 

Baked Lemon. — Bake a lemon or sour orange twenty 
minutes in a moderate oven. When done, open at one 
end and take out the inside. Sweeten with sugar or mo- 
lasses. This is excellent for hoarseness and pressure on 
the lungs. 

Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice from one lemon and 
add one tcd)lespoonful of sugar. Pour on one cup of 
boiling icater., and cool. Or take hot for a cold, after 
retiring. 

Flaxseed Lemonade. — Pour one quart of boiling loater 
o\evfour tahlespoonfuls o^ lohole flaxseed, and steep three 
hours. Strain and sweeten to taste, and add \hQ juice of 
two lemons. Add a little more water if the liquid seem too 
thick. This is soothing in colds. 

Irish-3Ioss Lemonade. — Soak, pick over, and wash 
one quarter of a cupj of Irish moss. Pour on one pint of 
boiling icater. Heat to the boiling-point, but not boil, 
and keep it at that temperature half an hour. Strain, and 
squeeze into it \\\q^ juice of one lemon, or enough to give it 
an acid taste. Sweeten to taste. Add acid phosp)hate in 
place of the lemon, if preferred. 

Wine Whey. — Boil one cup of new milk, and add one 
cup of wine. Let it stand on the back of the stove five 
minutes. Strain, and sweeten the whey. 

The whe}^, or water, of milk contains tlie sugar, salt, and 
other saline bodies necessar}- for digestion and the repair 
of the mineral part of the bod}'. 

Herb Teas. 
Pour one ciq^ of boiling icater over one tablespoonful of 
the herbs. Cover the bowl, set it over the teakettle, and

steep ten minutes. Sweeten if desi^-ed. Mullein tea is 
good for inflammation of the lungs ; Ch.amomile tea^ for 
sleeplessness ; Calamus and Catnip tea^ for colds and 
infants' colic ; Cinnamon tea^ for hemorrhages ; Water- 
melon-seed and Pumpkin-seed tea^ for strangury and 
summer complaint. A few sprigs of sage^ burnet^ balm, 
and sorrel, half a lemon, sliced, and three joints of boiling 
water, sweetened to taste, and covered closel}' until cold, 
makes an agreeable drink for a fever patient. 

Another Condition in sickness occurs when, after long- 
continued, prostrating, or rapid!}- wasting disease, the sys- 
tem demands immediate nourishment to supply- that waste, 
or when there is a lack of nutrition from any cause. Food 
that contains the most nourishment in the most easily as- 
similated form is now needed ; but the physician should 
always be consulted as to the food suitable during the dif- 
ferent diseases. Liquid food is most suitable, and should 
hefood as well as drink. In nearh^ all cases of fever milk 
is given when the patient can take it. Two or three grains 
of pepsin in a cup of milk or broth facilitate its digestion. 
In typhoid fever milk has often proved of great value, and 
is now generally recommended b}' the medical faculty in all 
cases of scarlet fever, nervous disorder, and all diseases 
arising from imperfect nutrition. It keeps up the strength 
of the patient, acts well upon the stomach, soothes the in- 
testines, and promotes sleep. It should be taken slowly to 
prevent the curdling in a dense mass which may occur if too 
much be taken at once. A pint of hot milk taken slowly, 
every four hours, will often check the most violent diar- 
rhoea and dysenter}'. It should never be boiled, only 
scalded. 

Eggnog or broth, meat broth, farina and oatmeal gruel, 
and port wine jell}-, are all suitable at such times ; but beef 
juice and tea are most generally used by physicians. They 
afford a fluid and easily assimilated form of food, and have 
a remarkable power of restoring the vigorous action of the 
heart, and dissipating the sense of exhaustion following 



422 The Boston Cook Book. 

severe, prolonged exertion. AVhen taken alone, tliej' are 
stimulating rather than nutritive, and a patient would soon 
starve il" he did not have the addition of the fibrine of the 
meat or of some farinaceous food, like bread crumbs or 
oatmeal. 

Beef Essence and Beef Tea. 

Beef essence is the pure juice of the meat. This is giver, 
where a patient needs much nourishment in a small com- 
pass. Beef tea is the juice of the meat diluted with water. 
It is a mistake to think that an}' beef because it is lean 
or cheap is good enough for beef tea. It will do for the 
soup-kettle, but not for those who are ill. Meat for beef 
tea should be lean, juic}', and of good flavor. Every par- 
ticle of fat, skin, and membrane must be removed. The 
top of the round and the back and middle of the rump con- 
tain the most and the best-flavored juice. It costs more 
per pound than some other pieces ; but as it yields nearly 
double the amount of juice, it is reallj' cheaper. The ten- 
derloin is often recommended for sick persons. It should 
never be used for beef tea, as it contains ver}' little juice 
and lacks flavor. When the tender fibre of the meat is 
desired, it ma}' be broiled, and served with the juice from 
some tougher steak. 

BroiUng is the quickest, and sometimes the most 
palatable, way of preparing both essence and tea in an 
emergenc}'. 

Drawing and heating the meat and juice is best where 
a little nourishment is to be given often, and where all the 
elements of the meat are needed. Soaking in cold water, 
then straining, and heating the juice onl}', is the most 
economical way, as more than twice the usual amount of 
juice ma}' be obtained by adding more water when the 
meat has not been heated. 

The allniminous juices of meat coagulate at 1G0° ; if the 
tea be allowed to boil, they become hard, and settle almost 
immediately when served. INIany make the mistake of 
straining the tea, or leaving the sediment untouched. If 



Beef Essence. 423 



the tea be heated just enough to make it palatable, it will 
hold the juices in solution, not separated, and will be thick, 
and of the color of chocolate, and much more palatable 
and nutritious than when boiled. 

Broiled Beef Essence. — Broil half a pound of round 
steak one or two minutes, or until the juice will flow. Cut 
it into small pieces. Squeeze the juice into a bowl placed 
over warm water. Salt^ and serve without reheating. Or 
pour it over a slice of hot dry toast. 

Broiled Beef Tea. — Add half a cup of boiling water 
to the meat after broiling as above. 

Bottled Beef Essence. — Put tioo pounds of roiiyid 
steals cut in small pieces, into a jar without water. Place 
the jar, covered closely, on a trivet in a keitle of cold 
water. Heat gradually, and keep it not quite at the 
boiling-point for two hours, or till the meat is white. 
Strain, pressing the meat to obtain all the juice ; season 
with salt. Or place the jar in a moderate oven for three 
hours. The liquid thus obtained x_ontains all the nutritive 
parts of the meat. It maj^ be kept in the refrigerator, 
and a small portion heated (not boiled), as wanted. Or it 
ma}' be made int(5 beef tea b}' diluting with boiling water. 
Beef essence given ice cold is sometimes more agreeable 
to a fever patient. 

Bottled Beef Tea. — Add 0)ie cup of cold vmter to the 
meat in the jar, and make as above. When the patient 
can take a little solid food, add tico table sjjoonfuls of 
stale bread crumbs to the beef tea, or mix with it oat- 
meal gruel ^ or add one teaspoonful ct finely chopped raw 
meat. 

Stev^ed Beef Essence. — Cut half a pound of round 
%teah into small pieces, season with one saltspoonful of 
salt., press it with a pestle or potato-masher, and let it 
stand in a covered bowl half an hour. Pour off the juice, 
and heat, but do not boil it. Serve immediately, without 
straining. 

As the salt without water will draw out oni}^ a small 
portion of the juice from the meat, a beef tea may be made 



424 The Boston Cook Book. 

from the scraps of meat left by adding one cup of cold 
water to the meat, and letting it stand two hours. Then 
strain and heat the liquid ; or the scraps of meat may be 
put in the soup-kettle. 

Economical Beef Tea. — Cut one pound o^ juicy rump 
steak into small pieces, and add one cup of cold loater. 
Let it stand in a covered bowl several hours. When 
read}" to serve, squeeze the meat and put it into another 
bowl. Strain the juice already obtained, add scdt to taste, 
and heat it just enough to be palatable, but not enough to 
curdle it. Serve at once, while hot. If it be heated over 
the fire, stir constantly, and take it off the moment it looks 
thick and is hot ; or heat it carefully over hot water. Add 
another cup of cold water to the scraps of meat, and soak 
again. Often the third cup of tea may be obtained from 
the same meat. This is excellent for hard-working people 
to take, in times of great exhaustion, before a hearty meal. 
It is one of the best and most easily prepared forms of 
soup or meat tea. 

Dr. MitclielVs Beef Tea. — One pound of lean beef cut 
fine ; add one pint of cold water and five drops of tnuri- 
atic acid. Put into a glass jar. Place the jar in a pan of 
water at 110°, and keep it at that temperature for two 
hours. Then strain through thick muslin luitil the meat 
is dr}", or press the juice out b}' squeezing. The acid 
makes the tea agreeable to a patient with fever, and also 
aids in drawing out the juices of the meat. 

Bavj Beef jSandwiches. — Scrape fine a small piece of 
fresh, juicy, tender, raw beef. Season highly with salt 
and pepper. Spread it on thin slices of bread, put them 
together like a sandwicli, and cut into small squares or 
diamonds. This will often tempt a patient who could not 
otherwise take raw meat. The sandwiches are sometimes 
made more palatable by toasting them slightly. 

Eggnog. — Beat the yolk of one egg ; add one table' 
spoonfid of sugar^ and beat to a cream. Add 07ie table- 
spoonful of iciiie or brandy^ and half a cup) of milk. Beat 
the lohite of the Qg^ to a froth, and stir in lightly. Omit 



Beef Tea. 425 



the milk when more condensed nourishment is required, 
or the wine, if not approved by the ph3'sician. It is more 
palatable when made with the milk. Whipped cream ma}' 
be substituted for the milk. In man}' cases it is desirable 
not to have the white beaten to a froth, as it causes wind 
in the stomach. 

Portable Beef Tea. — Two pounds of heef cut fine, 
and half a box of gelatine. Soak together in o)ie ^yint oi 
cold water one hour, squeezing often. Heat to nearly the 
boiling-point. Strain, pressing all the juice from the meat, 
till a glass jar with the juice, place the jar in water, 
and heat till the water outside the jar boils. Seal while 
hot. Dissolve tioo teaspoonfuls of the above prepara- 
tion in half a cup of boiling water, add a few grains of 
salt^ and serve at once. A convenient form of food for 
travellers. 

Broiled Beef Pidp. — Scrape raw beef to a pulp, make 
it into small cakes, and broil as steak. Season with salt 
and a few grains of cayenne pepper.^ and serve hot. 

Egg Tea and Coffee. — Beat the yoll: of one egg ; add 
one tahlespoonful of sugar, and beat to a cream ; add 07ie 
cup of tea or coff'ee, either hot or cold, and half a cup of 
cream. Stir in lightly the beaten white of the 2gg, and 
serve at once. 

Egg and Beef Tea — Add one cup of hot beef tea to 
the egg, beaten as above. 

Dishes for Convalescence. 
When the crisis of disease is past, the system needs 
gradual but complete nutrition, and the appetite is clamor- 
ous, fickle, or perhaps altogether wanting. Then is the 
time most critical for the patient, and most trying to the 
tact, skill, and patience of the nurse. Many a person has 
been carried safely through a long and distressing illness, 
onty to succumb at last to injudicious feeding, because of 
the nurse's ignorance or his own indiscretion. When solid

the forms given in the preceding rules.

The following dishes may also be used : broiled squab, 
venison, chicken, chop, steak, salmon, chicken panada, 
boiled halibut, roast beef, mutton, cream toast, eggs, aiid< 
03^sters (except when especially forbidden by the physi- 
cian), sweetbreads, baked potatoes, asparagus, onions, 
macaroni, custards, Charlotte Russe, snow pudding, ice- 
cream, sherbet, blanc-mange, Bavarian cream, sponge cake, 
simple puddings, stewed fruits, and man}' others, — receipts 
for which will be found as indicated in the table of lessons 
in the Nurse's Course. 

Broiling for the Invalid {Broiled Steak or Venison^. — 
Wipe with a clean wet cloth. Grease the gridiron with a 
bit of the fat. Broil over a clear fire, turning as often as 
you can count ten. Cook four minutes if the steak be 
about one inch thick ; not longer, as further cooking dries 
up the juices and destro3's some of the nutritive qualities. 
Be careful to serve on a hot platter, and season with salt^ 
and with ^pepper and hiitter if approved. Birds, chicken 
breasts, fish, and chops are better when seasoned, and 
wrapped in buttered paper, and then broiled, as this pre- 
vents them from burning or becoming too dr^ . Birds, fish, 
and chops are better, and more convenientl}' eaten, if boned 
before broiling. 

Broiled Steak ^ JVo. 2. — Broil half a pound of round 
steak and one slice of tenderloin. With a meat or lemon 
squeezer squeeze the juice from the round over the tender- 
loin. Season, and serve hot. 

Chicken Panada. — Orie cnp of cold roasted or boiled 
chicken., pounded to a paste. Add half a cup of stale 
bread crumbs, and enough l^oiling chicken liquor to make 
it a thick gruel. Salt to taste. Boil one minute, and 
serve hot. When the chicken has been roasted, boil the 
bones to obtain the liquor. 

Chicken Custard. — Scald togetlier one cup of strong 
chicken stock and one cup of cream. Pour it over the 
well-beaten yolks of three eggs, and cook in a double boiler 
till slightly thickened. Salt to taste, and serve cool in 
custard cups. 



Invalid Cookery, 427 



Crackers and Orange Marmalade. — Toast three crack- 
ers slightly. Dip them quickly into boiling salted water. 
Spread with a little butter., and put a layer of orange mar- 
malade, or any other jell}' or preserve, between them. Set 
them in the oven a few minutes before serving;. 



Racahout des Arabes. {Mrs. Devereux.') 

y^ pound best French chocolate. | 34 pound arrowroot. 

1 pound rice flour. | y^ pound loaf sugar, sifted. 

These materials are to be thoroughly mixed and rubbed 
together. A dessert spoonful of this mixture should be 
slightlj' wet with inilk or icater., then stirred into oiw pint 
of boiling milk^ and boiled five minutes. This is excellent 
food for invalids or convalescents. Serve hot, as a bever- 
age ; or make much thicker, to be eaten cold as a delicate 
pudding. 

Laban. {Miss Parloa.) — One quart of 7iew milk^ into 
which stir one tablespoonfid of yeast. Let it stand in a 
cool place to harden, which will take from three to twent}- 
four hours. When hard, take a tablespoonfid of the mix- 
ture, and stir it into a quart of new milk., and set away to 
harden. This is " Laban." It should be eaten with sugar 
and cream. If a constant supply be needed, reserve one 
tablespoonful each da}' for the next preparation. This re- 
ceipt is furnished by a lady who obtained it in Syria, and 
who advises a second or a third trial if the first attempt be 
unsuccessful. The dish is often palatable when the stomach 
is too weak for almost any other solid food. This is similar 
to Koumiss, or fermented mare's milk. 

Ash Cake. {Mrs. Henderson^ — Wet corn yneal., salted 
to taste, with enough cold water to make a soft dough. Let 
it stand half an hour, or longer. Mould into a cake one or 
two inches thick, as you prefer. Place it on a clean spot 
on the hearth, and cover with wood ashes. Bake from 
half to three quarters of an hour. Wipe before eating. 
The alkaline properties left by the ashes in the crust render 
it especially good for dyspeptics with an acid stomach. 



428 The Boston Cook Book. 



Gluten Gems. 



2 cups gluten. 

lo teaspoonful salt. 

2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder. 



2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

1 egg. 

2 cups water or milk. 



Bake in very hot buttered gem pans, in a hot oven, half 
an hour. 

Diet for Infants .and Young Children. 

Let ver}- young children have mother's millv above ever}*- 
thing else ; but if this be impossible, dissolve one ounce of 
sugar of onilk or loaf sugar in three fourths of a pint of 
boiling loater^ and mix, as required for use, with an equal 
quantity of fresh cow's milk. Give it, slightl}' warm, 
from a sweet, clean bottle. Sugar of milk is quite ex- 
pensive, but it is ver}^ much better for an infant than cane 
sugar. 

Teething children should have the milk from but one 
cow ; the cow should not be fed on green corn nor sour 
apples, as these produce acidit}' in the milk. A little 
thin, well-boiled oatmeal, or farina gruel, may be added 
to the milk. 

For summer complaint^ use scalded (not ]:)oiled) milk, 
prepared flour, roasted rice, boiled, mashed, and thinned 
with milk ; also rice jellv or barley gruel. Avoid all purely 
starch}^ gruels, hke arrowroot, sago, and cornstarch, upon 
which mau}^ children are fed to death. 

For constipation., a little salt added to cow's milk is 
often beneficial ; also gruel made from prepared coin meal 
and wheat flour, and oatmeal gruel. For older children 
use oatmeal, hominv or farina mush, and ripe fruit. 

Prejjared Flour {for Infants). — Tie one pint of 
flour in a stout cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it 
boil three hours. Turn out the flour l)idl, and scrape off 
the gluten which will be found in a mass on the outside of 
the ball and is not desirable. The inside will prove a dry 
powder, which is verv astringent. Grate a tablesjjoonfid 
of this powder from the ball as wanted ; wet it in cold 



Diet for Children. 429 

milk or toater, and stir it into one cup of boiling milk. 
Boil five minutes. Add a little salt. 

This is excellent for teething children. If the}' be 
troubled with constipation, use one quarter part corn 
meal and three quarters ic heat flour, boil as above, and 
stir some of the grated lump into boiling cream and water., 
using one part cream to six parts icater. For an infant 
the preparation should be thin enough to be taken from a 
bottle. Flour, after being cooked in this wa}' and then 
reduced to a finely divided form, loses its adhesive 
qualit}' ; and the particles are more easil}' separated and 
digested. 

Children and groioing persons need the most nutritious 
food, and plent}' of it at regular intervals ; but nothing 
stimulating nor exciting. The}' should be given, and com- 
pelled to take, sufficient time for eating ; and should be 
taught to masticate everything slowly and thoroughl}'. 
The}' should eat milk ; whole-wheat and cornmeal bread ; 
oatmeal, farina, and hominy mush ; plenty of ripe fruit 
raw, and stewed fruit sweetened ; beef, mutton, veni- 
son, and poultry, either roasted, broiled, or boiled ; baked 
potatoes, and asparagus ; green peas, beans, and corn, if 
every hull be first broken or cut ; eggs, omelets, and cus- 
tards ; plain sponge cake ; ice-cream, if not too hard 
and cold,' and eaten slowly ; siuiple fruit and bread 
puddings ; fruit, tapioca, and farina ; plain gingerbread 
and molasses cookies ; whole-wheat cookies and wafers. 
Children should avoid hot bread and griddle-cakes ; 
fried meats or cakes or doughnuts ; highly seasoned 
food ; rich gravies : rich pastry and cake ; pickles, pre- 
serves, all stimulants such as tea or coffee ; raisins, un- 
less cooked three hours and stoned ; sago, arrowroot, and 
other purely starchy foods, except when combined with 
milk, eggs, or fruit, and eaten with sugar and cream ; and 
especially veal and pork. Veal is an immature meat, lack- 
ing in nourishment ; and of the free use of pork, apart 
from the question of the trichinae, a majority of physi- 
cians believe that it is largely responsible for the forms of 



430 The Boston Cook Book. 



scrofulous disease that have so undermined the health of 
civilized nations. 

What are termed the "fancies" of delicate persons, 
especially children, are often natural instincts, pointing 
out what is beneficial to the system, or the reverse. All 
children have a fondness for sugar, which should be grati- 
fied in moderation rather than repressed. Their desire for 
it is natural, else it would not have been placed in the milk 
which forms their only nourishment in infancy. But candy, 
rich preserves, and cake are not the best form of sweets 
for children. Pure block sugar or maple sugar is better 
than any form of candy. It should never be allowed be- 
tween meals, but may be given occasionally as a part of 
the dessert. The habit of munching candy between meals 
destroys the appetite, disturbs the digestion, and is the 
cause of much illness among children. Children troubled 
with worms should avoid sugar, preserves, and green 
vegetables. 

Jlilk should enter largely into the diet of children. It con- 
tains caseine, or flesh-forming material ; cream and sugar, 
which are heat producers ; mineral salts, for the bou}' 
structure ; and water, as a solvent for all the other materials 
necessary in nutrition. It should be used with discretion, 
however ; not drunk immoderately, but taken slowly as 
food after the pattern given b}' nature. Milk as taken is 
a fluid ; but as soon as it meets the acid of the gastric 
juice, it is changed to a soft, curdy, cheese-like substance, 
and then must be digested, and the stomach is overtasked 
if too much be taken at once. A large glass of milk swal- 
lowed suddenly will form in the stomach a lump of dense, 
chees}^ curd, which maj- even prove fatal to a weak stomach. 
Under the action of the stomach this cheesy mass will turn 
over and over like a heavy weight ; and as the gastric juice 
can only attack its surface, it digests very slowly. But 
this same milk, taken slowl}^ or with dr}^ toast, light rolls, 
or soft dr}' porridge, form« a porous lump through which the 
gastric juice can easil}' pass, and which breaks up every 
time the stomach turns it over. Milk should be shghtly 



Diet for Invalids. 43 1 

salted, and eaten with bread stuffs or sipped by the 
spoonful. 

Cow's milk produces less heat than human milk ; a child 
would grow thin upon it unless a little sugar were added. 
Wheat flour has such an excess of heat-producing mate- 
rial as would fatten a child undul}', and should have cow's 
milk added to it to reduce its fattening power. 

Hints on Diet for Invalids. 

Vanilla should not be used as a flavoring in food for 
sick people. It is medicinal ; aiKl all medicines are more 
or less poisonous, and are not to be taken as food. 

Pepper is allowable when a slight stimulant is needed. 
It should be white or cayenne pepper, as these are less irri- 
tating than black pepper. 

Boiled onions are soothing to the mucous membrane. 
In inflammation of the stomach they are often helpful 
when a piece of white bread could not be digested. 

Broiled or roasted squah^ venison^ chicken, mutton^ 
and beef, in the order given, are the most easily assim- 
ilated meats. 

Game, being rich in phosphates, is valuable for invalids. 

Broiled bacon, dusted with cayenne, is an easily digested 
form of fat. 

Tomatoes as an article of diet are considered by many 
physicians a remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion. 

Watery, green, or diseased pjotatoes should never be 
eaten. If there be only a small spot of decay, it taints 
the whole potato. Young potatoes are very indigestible. 

Eggs for sick people should be taken raw. When 
beaten with cold milk, they are more quickly absorbed. If 
cooked, they should be either very soft, or hard enough to be 
easily crumbled to a powder, as in any intermediate stage 
the albumen is tough instead of brittle, and being tough is 
insoluble b}' the gastric juice ; these insoluble portions are 
often delayed in the stomach or intestines till they putrefy, 
and the sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonia evolved be- 
come poisonous to the intestinal canal. 



432 The Boston Cook Book. 

Soups which have in them cream or milk are better for 
invalids than those rich in gelatine. Cream of Celery 
and Potage a la Reine are especially suitable. Strong 
Bouillon is adapted to those suffering from hemorrhoids 
or any disease of the rectum, as there is no solid waste. 

Dyspeptics should avoid anything which they (not 
others) cannot digest. There are so many causes for and 
forms of dyspepsia, that it is impossible to prescribe one 
and the same diet for all. Nothing is more disagreeable 
or useless than to be cautioned against eating this or that, 
because your neighbor "So-and-so" cannot eat such 
things. If we would all stud}' the nature and digestion of 
food, and remember that air and exercise are as essential 
as food in promoting good health, we could easilj^ decide 
upon the diet best suited to our individual needs. 

The diabetic should abstain from sugar and anything 
which is converted into sugar in digestion, such as all 
starch}' foods, — fine wheat flour, rice, macaroni, tapioca, 
liver, potatoes, beets, carrots, turnips, parsnips, peas, 
beans, very old cheese, sweet omelets, custards, jellies, 
starch}' nuts, sweet sauces, wine, and liquors. He may 
eat oysters, all kinds of fish, meat, poultr}', and game, 
soups without any starchy thickening, lettuce, cucumbers, 
watercresses, dandelions, 3'oung onions, cold slaw, olives, 
cauliflower, spinach, cabbage, string beans, ripe fruit of 
all kinds without sugar, cream, butter, milk sparingl}', 
gluten, flour, oily nuts freely salted, eggs, coffee, and 
cocoa. 

The corpulent should abstain from fat as well as sugar 
and starch. A diet of whole-wheat, milk, vegetables, 
fruits, and lean meat will produce onl}' a normal amount of 
fatness; while an excess of sweets, acids, spices, and 
shortening keeps the system in an unheal thful condition. 

Those who can digest fine flour, pastr}', sugar, and fats 
become loaded with fat, but are neither strong nor vigorous. 
Thin people with weak digestion should also avoid such 
food ; for thin people are often kept thin b}' the same food 
which makes others fat. If they cannot digest the starch, 



Diet for the Gouty, etc. 433 

butter, and fine flour, the S3'stem is kept in a feverish, d3'S- 
peptic state ; the}' become nervous or go into consumption 
for no other reason than that hfe is burned out by a diet 
which only feeds the tire and does not renew the tissues. 
"Men dig their graves with ttieir teeth; not only by 
drinking whiskey and using tobacco, but by eating food 
loaded down with inflammator}' materials." 

The bilious and gouty should eat sparinglj- of brown 
meats, cheese, eggs, beans, peas, or food which is rich in 
albuminoids. A certain amount of albuminoid or nitro- 
genized food is requisite for tissue growth and repair ; 
more being required for growing persons and the conva- 
lescent than for health}' adults. Most Americans are in- 
clined to eat more albuminoid food than is required. It 
gives a sensation of energy, of being equal to work, which 
is ver}' pleasant. But when we have '' too much of a good 
thing," more than is needed for repair of tissue, this sur- 
plus of albuminous material is imperfecth^ oxidized, the 
blood is laden with waste, and biliousness or gout is the 
result. Fish gives less albuminoid waste than meat. 

People who are inclined to constipation should eat 
whole- wheat, rye, and corn bread and mushes, ripe fruit, 
berries, green corn, vegetables, beef, mutton, poultry, 
milk, cream, and butter ; and should avoid fried or greasy 
food, hot bread, rich cake, veal, pork, or anything whicl:. 
has so much wood}^ fibre or cellulose chat it only irritates 
the digestive canal, such as the outer bran of wheat, coarse 
oatmeal, etc. 

Those with consumptive tendencies should eat whole 
some, easil}' digested and assimilated food, with plenty of 
fat, — not in the indigestible form that it takes when 
mixed with starch, but as in cream, sweet butter, fat of 
roast or boiled meat, the fat, but not the lean, of ham and 
corned beef, oil, salads, corn-meal, oatmeal, etc. 

The diet of people who are well should be governed 
largely by their age, occupation, and exercise. Adults 
should have a variety of wholesome food cooked in diflTerent 
ways. Aged people should have a diet more like that of 

28 



434 The Boston Cook Book, 

children. If the occupation tax the tnuscular strength^ 
use muscle-making food ; not wholl}' meat, as man}^ labor- 
ing people are inclined to think, but grains, peas, beans, 
cabbage, milk, cheese, eggs, whole- wheat bread, and 
chocolate, with a small amount of beef, mutton, and 
poultr3\ Students and brain-ioorkers need more of brain- 
producing and less of muscle-making food. Brain food 
must contain phosphorus, which is found largely in oysters^ 
eggs, fish, lean meat, wheat, peas, beans, and fruit. Those 
who are engaged in sedentary occupations^ who take 
little exercise and live in close, confined rooms, should 
eat onl}^ the most easil}' digested food. 

People w^ho engage in regular active labor, who take 
plentj' of exercise In the open air, cultivate a cheerful, 
happ}' disposition, live temperatel}' in ever^^ wa}', and have 
naturally' strong digestive organs, can eat an^' kind of 
wholesome food that has been properl}' cooked, and have 
no consciousness of a stomach or an}' visceral organs ; and 
appetite, unless prevlousl}' impaired, is their best guide. 
If the digestive organs be not strong naturall}', such a 
mode of life as the above will tend to make them so, more 
than any amount of drugs or quack medicines. 



How to JDo Tt. 435 



MISCELLANEOUS HINTS. 

To Chop Suet, — Cut into small pieces and remove 
the membrane. Sprinkle with flour, and chop in a cold 
place to prevent its becoming soft and sticky-. 

To Clean Currants, — Put them in a squash strainer, 
and sprinkle thickly- with flour. Rub them well until they 
are separated, and the flour, grit, and fine stems have 
passed through the strainer. Then place the strainer and 
currants in a pan of water, and wash thoroughl3\ Lift 
the strainer and currants together, and change the water 
till clear. Drain bet^\^.en towels, and pick over carefulU*. 
Dr}- them in a sunn}^ place or between towels, but do not 
harden them b}' putting them into the oven. 

To Stone Haisins. — Pour boiling water over them, 
and let them stand in it five or ten minutes. Drain, and 
rub each raisin between the thumb and finger till the seeds 
come out clean, then cut or tear apart, or chop, if wanted 
very fine. 

Core Apj)les before paring, and there is less danger of 
their breaking. 

Egg Shells. — Wash eggs as soon as they come from 
the market, and then the shells maj^ be used in clearing 
coffee, soup, etc. 

To Boil a Pudding in a Cloth. — Wring strong cotton 
cloth out of boiling water, and spread over a bowl. 
Sprinkle with flour, fill with the pudding, draw the cloth 
together, and tie tightly, then flour near the opening. 
Plunge into boiling water, and keep the water boiling 
during the time for cooking. Add boiling water as needed, 
and replenish the fire often. 

Meringues should be put on puddings after they are 
slightly cool, as, if the pudding be hot, the Q^g will liquefy. 



436 The Boston Cook Booh, 

Moulds should be greased for any steamed mixture ; 
wet in cold water for jell}', creams, etc. ; and neither wet 
nor greased if to be lined with cake. A mould of jelly 
will cool quicker if placed in a pan of ice water or snow 
than in the ice-chest. 

Candied or Crystallized Fruit or NiUs. {3Irs. Camp- 
bell.) — Boil one cup oi granulated sugar and one cup of 
boiling water together for half an hour. Then dip the 
point of a skewer into the syrup and then into cold water. 
If the thread formed break off brittle, the syrup is read}'. 
The s3Tup must never be stirred, and must boil slowly, 
not furiously. When done, set the saucepan in boihng 
water, or pour the syrup into a bowl placed in hot water, 
to keep the syrup from cand3'ing. Take the prepared 
fruit or nuts on the point of a large needle or fine skewer, 
dip them into the syrup, and then la}' them on a dish, 
which has been lightly buttered or oiled ; or string them 
on a thread, and after dipping in the syrup suspend them 
by the thread. When oranges are used, divide them into 
eighths, and wipe all moisture. Cherries should be stoned. 
English walnuts are especially nice prepared in this way. 

To Blanch Almonds and other Nuts. — Remove the 
shells, cover with boiling water, and let them stand till the 
dark skin will rub off easily. Then put them in cold 
water, rub off the skins, and dry between towels. 

Corned Meat. — Fresh meat may be kept some time by 
corning it slightly. W^ipe carefully, and remove any parts 
that are not sweet and fresh, then rub all over thickly 
with salt. Or make a brine with rock salt and cold water ; 
use salt enough to float the meat, then cover, and put 
a heavy weight on the cover to keep the meat under the 
brine. Three days' time is sufficient for corned meat. 

To Make Paper Boxes. — These can be obtained, in a 
variety of forms, from the confectioner ; but plain ones 
may be made in this way. Take a piece of stifle white 
paper, five inches square. Find the centre of the square 
by folding two opposite corners together and creasing 
lightly in the middle, then open and fold the other two in 



Hoiv to Do It. 437 



the same way. Fold the two sides over till they meet in 
the centre, then fold the two ends. Open, and cut in the 
fold down to the line at each end, but not on the side. 
Fold the sides over on the outside about one quarter of an 
inch ; then fold the middle part of the end in the same 
way. Then turn the ends of the side pieces round behind 
the end, and let them meet in the middle, and fold the 
edge of the end over them. Fasten the ends with a few 
stitches or with paste. A border of fancy perforated paper 
may be pasted on the edge. 

A Pastry Bag. — One third of a yard of yard-wide 
rubber sheeting will make three bags one foot square. 
Fold two opposite corners together, stitch along the edge, 
and make a triangular bag. Cut off at the point to make 
an opening large enough to insert the end of a tin tube. 
It is convenient to have three bags, with openings of 
diiferent sizes, — one for eclairs, one for lad}^ fingers, and 
one for frosting. The tube for eclairs is three fourths ol 
an inch wide at the small end ; that for lady fingers, three 
eighths of an inch ; and the frosting tubes, of various sizes, 
some of them quite small. Fit the tube into the opening, 
and fill the bag with the mixture. Draw the edges together, 
and twist the top tightly to keep out the air. Hold the 
bag in the left hand, with the tube close to the place where 
the mixture is to be spread ; press with the right, and guide 
the mixture into an}^ shape desired. A slight pressure is 
sufficient. When no longer needed, wash the bags in cold 
(never in hot) water, and dry carefully. 

Vanilla Sugar. — One j^ound o^ turn}) sugar and one 
ounce of Mexican vanilla beans. Cut the beans in small 
pieces, and pound in a mortar, with the sugar, till fine 
like flour. Sift through a fine strainer, pound the remain- 
der again, and sift till all is fine. Keep in a tightly 
corked bottle. Use a tablesj^oonful for a quart of ice- 
cream. Or cut the beans into small pieces, and split them 
that the seeds may be exposed. Put a7i ounce of the 
beans in a small jar with a pound of sugar. Sift the 
sugar as required, and use as above ; add more sugar, 



438 The Boston Cook Book, 

keep closely covered, and use as long as there is any flavor 
in the sugar. 

Canned Fruit Juices. — Fruit juices ma}' be kept for 
a long time b}' canning the same as whole fruit. They 
are convenient for water ices and summer beverages. 
Mash the fruit, and rub the pulp through a fine sieve. 
Mix about three pounds of sugar with one quart of fruit 
■juice and p%dp. Fill Mason's jars with the S3Tup, cover., 
and place in a heater with cold water to come nearly to 
the top of the jar. Let the water boil half an hour, then 
fill each jar to the brim, seal, and cool in the water. 

To Mould Ice Cream. — Ice cream is more attractive, 
when served, if moulded, and if one has no fancy moulds, 
the freezer can will always give the round shape. If 
moulds are used, the cream should be packed into them 
closely, filling every crevice. The cover should always fit 
over and not into the mould. Bind a buttered cloth 
round the edge of the cover, or lay a buttered paper over 
the top of the cream, or coat the edge with butter or 
melted suet to fill all the crevices and keep out the salt 
water. Bury the moulds in ice and salt ; a little less salt 
than is used in freezing. Cover the ice with wet carpet- 
ing. The cream will keep hard several hours, but it is well 
to examine it occasionally, and when the mould floats, 
draw off the water and add more ice and salt. When 
ready to serve, wash off the butter and salt from the 
mould, lift off the cover and paper, and turn the mould 
over a platter. The warmth of the room will soon melt 
the cream sufficiently for the mould to be lifted ; if not, 
then lay a hot cloth on the mould, or dip the mould quickly 
in warm water. Salt water cannot get into the mould if 
full, but often when cream is left over and you replace it 
in the mould only partially filled, the water will get in. 

To Iteep Lettuce^ Celery^ Watercress, etc. — Wash them 
and nip off any part that shows signs of deca3^ Rinse 
each leaf separately to be sure it is free from grit, lay 
the inner leaves, such as may be used for a salad in 
regular order in a wet napkin, and put them away in a 
cold place. Break up the tough outside leaves, and cook 
them until tender in boiling water, as you do any greens. 



The Dining-Room. 439 



THE DINING-ROOM. 

The subjects of "The Arrangement of the Table/ 
'''Dinner-Giving," and "Bills of Fare" have been full}' 
treated in other cook books, and it would be difficult to 
add to what has alread}' been said. Hints on garnishing, 
carving, and appropriate combinations of dishes have been 
given in connection with man}' of these receipts ; and want 
of space forbids anything more than some general rules. 

Above all things, attempt nothing in style or expense 
bej'ond what 3'ou can well atford. There is no more paltry 
ambition, nothing that contains more certainly the seeds of 
unhappiness and disaster, than such a desire for "empty 
show," which all sensible people must despise. 

Let your breakfasts be of wholesome and substantial 
food. The system needs nourishment in the morning after 
the long, unbroken fast of the night. The practice of tak- 
ing onl}' a cup of tea or coffee with hot biscuit, and possi- 
blv pie or doughnuts, gives a very poor foundation for the 
morning's labor, which is and should be the hard labor of 
the da}'. Milk, coffee, or chocolate, mushes, fruits, pota- 
toes or bread, meat, fish, or eggs, in some of their simple 
and digestible combinations should form the basis of the 
breakfast. The morning meal should be taken as soon as 
possible after rising. Any prolonged bodily exertion or 
exposure to the earl}' morning air, before the stomach is 
fortified by food, is now condemned by the majority of 
physicians. 

The midday and evening meal may vary with the occu- 
pations and habits of the family ; but a regular hour for 
eating should be observed, whether the more substantial 
meal come at noon or night ; and if at night sufficient time 
should be allowed for digestion to be completed before 



440 The Boston Cook Booh 

sleeping. A supper of cold bread and cake or pie is 
neither appetizing nor satisfying for those who have been 
hard at work through the day. " Something warm or 
hearty, something for a relish," every man craves for 
supper. Toast, brewis, warm tea-cakes, cocoa, oatmeal, 
warmed-over potatoes, cold meat, made dishes, eggs, 
oysters, etc., are far better than the common supper of 
sweets. 

Every one may have clean, if not fine, table linen. An 
under covering of cotton llaimel or felt made to fit the 
table is desirable, as it prevents noise, and a linen cloth 
may be laid over it more smoothly than over the bare table. 
Thin tablecloths remain fresh longer if stiffened slightly 
with very thin starch, but heavy damask requires no stif- 
fening. Keep the cloths in a drawer large enough to hold 
them without much folding. Avoid making many folds in 
ironing, and in handling them fold alwaj'S in the creases. 
In laying the cloth, place the centre of it in the centre of 
the table, and have the folds straight with the edges of the 
table. Crease the cloth round the edge of the table, that 
it ma}- drape smoothly. 

Lay a plate, right side up, for each person. If the table 
be long, place one plate at each end, and those at the sides 
opposite each other. Place the napkin at the left of the 
plate, and at dinner place a piece of bread between the 
folds of the napkin. Place the knives, butter plate, and 
tumbler at the right of each plate, the forks at the left, and 
the soup and dessert spoons in front, the handles toward 
the right hand, — the number of each depending upon the 
number of courses. The fruit dish or flowers should occupy 
the centre of the table ; the salt and pepper, butter, jelly, 
pickles, etc., at the corners. Place the various dishes on 
the table in regular order, straight with the table, or, if at 
an angle, let there be some unifbrmitv, never helter-skelter. 
The cups, plates, and dishes for hot food should be heated 
in hot water or in a warming-oven. Use a spoon to place 
ice in delicate glasses or pitchers ; or put in the water first, 
and then the ice, to avoid breaking- 



Table Etiquette. 441 



Do not let the table become disordered during the meal. 
The dishes, plates, etc., should be removed noiselessh', one 
by one ; and never piled one upon another, after the hasty 
fashion of second-class hotels. 

If the serving be done b}- the host and hostess, it is more 
convenient for them to sit at the sides of the table ; the 
host serving the substantial dishes, and the hostess the tea 
or coffee, vegetables or entrees, puddings, and the dessert 
Where there are servants to do the waiting, the host and 
hostess ma}' sit at the ends of the table, as there they can 
command a better view of their guests, and see that they 
are properly- served. The hostess should serve the soup, 
salad, dessert, and coffee ; the host, the fish and meat ; and 
the servants, the vegetables and entrees. 

At a dinner served a la Husse^ the fruit and flowers only 
are placed upon the table, the several courses being served 
from the side. 

Man}' volumes have been written upon table etiquette. 
Some of the suggestions they contain are practical ; others 
useless. What is considered proper at one place or time 
is not approved under other circumstances ; and those 
desirous of observing the usages of good society are 
often sorely perplexed to keep pace with the variations 
of fashion. But if, instead of following mere arbitrary 
rules from the low standpoint of " style," we would take 
for our guidance the best definition of true politeness as 
given by Dr. Watts, — " Love manifested in an easy and 
graceful manner," — we need never be at a loss as to '' what 
to do and what not to do." A moment's observation will 
show the strictness of etiquette maintained in the family 
in which you may be a guest, — for instance, whether the 
servants are expected to take entire charge of serving 
everything, or whether the family reserve to themselves 
something of the happy privilege of courtesy and thought 
for each other ; and you may forget with them, in the 
mutual interchange of the proper attentions, that freezing 
formality which sometimes forbids that you should seem to 
know or care how your neighbor fares. "Think not of 



442 The Boston Cook Book. 

3'oursoir, but of what will contribute most to another's com- 
fort or convenience," remembering that for tlie time being 
utter deference should be paid to the evident arrangement 
of the house at which you are. This is the safest stand- 
ard for table etiquette, as well as for good manners ever}-- 
where. No selfish person can ever be trulj' polite. Children 
should be carefully' trained in table manners as soon as 
the}' are old enough to come to the table, and accustomed 
to perfect politeness ; then there will be no fear of mis- 
haps, nor special training needed for '' company," nor any 
awkward habits to be overcome in later life. 

After a meal brush up any crumbs that may have fallen, 
lest the}' be trodden into the carpet. Collect the knives, 
forks, and spoons by themselves. Put any food that ma}* 
be used again on small dishes, nev&r on the dishes nsed in 
serving. Scrape the dishes, empt}' and rinse the cups, 
and pack neatly near where the}- are to be washed. Brush 
the crumbs from the cloth, instead of shaking it, then fold 
and put it away carefully. 

Never pile nice china or any other dishes in the dishpan. 
Begin with a pan half filled with hot soapy water. Keep 
the soap in a shaker made for that purpose, or in a tin 
cup ; make a strong lather in the cup, and use as needed. 
Never leave the soap in the dishpan to waste and stick to 
the dishes. Wash glasses first. Slip them in sideways, 
so that the hot water will touch outside and inside at once, 
and then there will be no danger of breaking from unequal 
expansion. Wash one at a time, and wipe instantly with- 
out draining or rinsing. Wash the silver and wipe at once, 
as it keeps bright longer if wiped out of hot soap}' water. 
Keep a cake of silver soap at hand, and rub each piece of 
silver as soon as discolored. Then wash the china, begin- 
ning with the cups, saucers, pitchers, and least greasy 
dishes, and changing the water as soon as cool or greasy. 
Place these dishes in the rinsing-pan with the cups inside 
up and plates resting on the edges, that they' may be 
scalded inside as well as outside, and drain quickly. 
Scald and wipe immediately. 



Kitchen Utensils. 443 



"Dave's" method of washing dishes, though not in 
general use, has been proved satisfactor3^ Place a pan 
of cold water between the washing and rinsing pans. 
After washing and wiping the glasses and silver, add 
more hot water, and wash the china first in the hot suds, 
then dip each dish instantl}' into the cold water, and stand 
it on the edge to drain in ths rinsing-pan. The cold water 
rinses off the hot suds, and the sudden change of tempera- 
ture dries the dishes almost instantl}^ ; and they require 
little or no wiping. The}' will be neither " sticky nor 
streak}'." 

Where there is only one woman for " cook, waitress, 
hostess, and kitchen girl," it is well, after the table is 
cleared and the dishes neatly packed, to wash first the 
kitchen dishes, and pots and kettles ; then with clean 
water and towels wash and wipe the table dishes. The 
hands will be left in much better condition than when the 
pots and kettles are washed last. 

The Care of Kitchen Utensils. 

A complete list of kitchen utensils is not given in this 
work, as the variety and numlier needed will be largely 
determined by circumstances. There are several utensils, 
which are not perhaps in general use, which lessen the 
labor of cooking, and add much to the attractiveness of 
food prepared by their aid. 

There is nothing that makes so much difi'erence between 
ordinary and delicate cooking as a set of strainers. There 
should be one of vert/ fine wire for sifting soda, spices, 
etc., and for straining custards and jellies ; others with 
meshes from one sixteenth to one eighth of an inch in 
diameter ; also a squash st7Xiiner and a colander. Ex- 
tension toire strainers are very convenient. Keep also a 
supply of strainer cloths^ made from coarse crash or cheese 
cloth^ 2i\\(\.fine napkin linen. 

A set of oval tin moulds^ a melon mould., and one or 
two fancy moulds are convenient for entrees, puddings, 
and jellies. 



444 The Boston Cook Booh. 

Other useful articles are Dover egg-beaters^ large and 
small ; ordinar}- small loooden spootis and the larger per- 
forated ones ; a tchip churn ; granite sauce2)a)is and steifj- 
pans^ holding from half a pint to six quarts ; double 
boilers; a i«?>6 Jas^e«5 for frying ; 2l p)Otato slicer ; define wire 
broiler for toast, and two coarser ones for steak and fish ; 
a set of pastry bags and frosting tubes ; fancy vegetable 
cutters; a glass r oiling -pin ; and, above all, a small 
sharp-pointed knife, made from the best steel, for paring 
potatoes, turnips, etc., and a set of tiri measuring-cups 
holding half a pint, and divided into quarters and thirds. 

It is a mistake to have manj" large, un wield}' dishes. 
Small saucepans and small bowls are more convenient, and 
granite or agate ware is much lighter to handle and more 
easily kept clean than ironware. Buckets are convenient 
for keeping sugar and small quantities of flour. Glass jars 
or wdde-mouthed bottles are best for nearh' all groceries, 
such as rice, tapioca, meal, raisins, etc. The}' are easily 
cleansed, and the contents are plainly seen. The}' may be 
kept air-tight, or, if that be unnecessary, old jars not suit- 
able for canning may be utilized. 

A refrigerator should be examined daily and kept thor- 
oughly clean. If a suitable brush cannot be had, a long 
stiff wire with a bit of cloth on the end should be used to 
clean the drain pipe. Pour boiling washing-soda water 
through it every other day, and do not forget to wash off 
the slime that adheres to the water pan. Fish, onions, 
cheese, any strong vegetables, lemons, or meat not per- 
fectly sweet, should not be kept in the same ice-box with 
milk or butter. 

Do not become wedded to the idea that dishes can only 
be washed in a sink. If your pantry or cookroom be some 
distance from your sink, and have a broad shelf or table 
in it, take your dishpan to the pantry, wash and wipe your 
dishes there, and in this way save a few of the unneces- 
sary steps which soon amount to miles with many weary 
housekeepers. 

Never wash a bread-board in an iron sink. The iron 



Care of Utensils. 445 

will leave a black mark on the board, which it is difficult 
to remove. Wash the board on the table where j'ou have 
used it; use cold water, and scrub occasionalU' with. sand 
soap. In scraping dough from the board, scrape with the 
grain of the wood, and hold the knife in a slanting direc- 
tion, to prevent roughening the surface of the board. 
A\'ash, and wipe dr^', and never let dough accumulate in 
the cracks. Have one board for bread and pastr}^ and 
keep it smooth. Use a smaller board for rolling crumbs 
and pounding ana cleaning meat and fish. 

A Dover egg-beater should never be left to soak in 
water, as the oil will be washed out of the gears and the 
beater be hard to turn ; or, if used again before it be dry, 
the oil and water will spatter into the beaten mixture. 
Use it with clean hands, and then the handle will require 
no washing. Wipe the wires with a damp cloth immedi- 
ately after using, dry thoroughly, and keep it well oiled. 

All dishes should be scraped before washing. A small 
wooden knife is best for this purpose. Bread and cake 
bowls, or any dishes in which flour or eggs have been 
used, are more easil}' cleaned if placed in cold water after 
using, or washed immediatel}'. 

Clear up as 3'ou work : it takes but a moment then, and 
saves much time and fatigue afterward. 

Never put pans and kettles half filled with water on the 
stove to soak. It onl}^ hardens whatever ma}^ have ad- 
hered to the kettle, and makes it much more difficult to 
clean. Keep them full of cold water, and soak them away 
from the heat. 

Kitchen knives and forks should never be placed in the 
dish water. Man}^ err in thinking it is onh' the handles 
which should not be wet. The practice of putting the 
blades into a pitcher of very hot water is wrong, as the 
sudden expansion of the steel b}' the heat causes the han- 
dles to crack. Keep the knives out of the water, but wash 
thoroughly with the dishcloth, rub them with mineral soap 
or brick dust, and wipe them dry. Keep them bright, and 
sharpen often on a sandstone. The disadvantage and 



44^ The Boston Cook Booh. 

vexation of dull tools would be avoided if ever}' woman 
would learn to use a whetstone, and where and when to 
appl}' a little oil. 

Milk will sour quickl}' if put into dishes which have not 
been scalded. They should first be washed in clear cold 
water, then in hot soap}' water, then rinsed in clear boil- 
ing water, and wiped with a dry fresh towel. Do not for- 
get to scrape the seams and grooves of a double boiler. 

Ironware should be washed, outside as well as inside, in 
hot soap}^ water, rinsed in clean hot water, and wiped dry, 
not with the dishcloth, but with a dry towel. Dripping- 
pans, Scotch bowls, and other greasy dishes should be 
scraped, and wiped with soft paper, which will absorb the 
grease. The paper will be found useful in kindling the 
fire, and is a great saving of water, which is sometimes 
an object. A tablespoonful of soda added to the water 
will facilitate the cleaning. 

Kitchen mineral soap or pumice stone may be used 
freel}' on all dishes. It will remove the stains from 
white knife handles, the brown substance that adheres to 
earthen or tin baking-dishes, and the soot whicli collects 
on pans and kettles used over a wood or kerosene fire. 
Tins should be washed in clean^ hot soapy water. Rub 
them frequentl}^ with mineral soap, and they ma}' be kept 
as bright as when new. Saucepans and other tin or 
granite dishes browned by use may be cleaned b}' letting 
them remain half an hour in boiling soda water, then 
rubbing with a wire dishcloth or stiff brush. 

A new tin coff'ee-pot, if never washed on the inside 
with soap, may be kept much sweeter. Wash the outside, 
and rinse the inside thoroughly with clear water. Then 
put it on the stove to dry,' and when dr\" rub the inside 
well with a clean, dr}- cloth. All the brown sediment 
may be wiped off" in that wa}', but a soapy dishcloth should 
never be put inside. 

Keep a granite pan near the sink to use in washing 
vegetables, and use the hand basin only for its legitimate 
purpose. Pare vegetables into the pan, and not into the 



Dish Washing. 447 



sink. A strainer or an}^ old quart tin pan with small 
holes in the bottom is a great help in keeping a sink clean. 
Pour the coffee and tea grounds, the dish water, and 
everything that is turned into the sink through the strainer 
first, and then empt}' the contents of the strainer into the 
refuse pail. 

Never use a ragged or lint}- dishcloth. The lint collects 
round the sink spout, and often causes a serious obstruc- 
tion. A dish mop is best for cups and cleanest dishes, 
but a strong linen cloth should be used for ever3'thing 
which requires hard rubbing. AVash the sink thoroughly, 
flush the drainpipe often with hot suds or soda water, 
wipe dr}', and rub with a greased cloth or with kerosene. 
Keep it greased if you wish to prevent its rusting. 

Cremation is the most satisfactory way^ of disposing of 
kitchen refuse, both as a matter of convenience and for 
sanitary reasons. But if there must be other disposition 
made of it, keep two pails and use them alternatel}', 
cleansing each as soon as emptied. 

Wash dish towels in cold water, with plenty of soap, 
and rinse thoroughh' in cold water, every time the}' are 
used. If left to dry without washing, the}^ will be sticky 
to handle and have a disagreeable odor. If the dishes 
be well washed, rinsed, and drained, the dish towels will 
require no rubbing. It is easier to take care of three or 
four which have never been left to become grim}^ than to 
wash one after it is stained and saturated with grease. 
Towels used in this way may be kept sweet and clean 
without boiling or drying in the sun. This method has 
been proved b}' years of trial. 

With a little care in observing these hints, and always 
using clean, hot soapy water (ami not a liquid fit onl}' for 
the swill cart) , changing it as soon as greasy, dish- washing 
would be robbed of half its terrors. And after the work 
is done, ii the hands be carefully washed with Castile soap, 
not with strong washing-soap, and wiped dr}', no un- 
pleasant effect upon the skin will be felt. Some use a little 
vinegar to counteract the eflTect of the alkali in the soap. 



448 The Boston Cook Book. 

A large apron made like a child's tire, high in the neck, 
with long sleeves, and buttoned in the back, is the best 
pattern for a work apron. It protects the entire dress, 
and can be easily removed when one is called from the 
kitchen. Print or cambric with a white ground and small 
black figures wears better than colored print. 

New, white mosquito netting and cheese cloth are useful 
for draining lettuce and for putting around fish, chicken, 
or vegetables whicli require careful boiling ; also for bags 
for herbs and spices. Small squares of new cotton cloth 
are useful for wiping meat or fish. Keep them clean, and 
use for nothing else. 

Keep a good supply of small holders, large coarse 
towels to use about the oven, and fine crash towels for 
wiping dishes. Keep a damp towel on the table when 
cooking, for wiping the hands. Avoid the habit of work- 
ing with stick}' or flourj' fingers, or using your apron for a 
hand towel or oven holder, or using the dish towels about 
the stove. 

These suggestions are given by one who has always 
liked to wash dishes, and who thinks it not beneath the 
dignity of any woman to learn to do such work in the 
very best manner, and that no apology is needed for 
acknowledging a taste for this much-abused portion of 
domestic work. 

To remove Iron Rust. — Keep a bottle of strong solu- 
tion of oxalic acid, plainly labelled ^' Poison," in a handy 
place for use on washing day. Gather up the cloth round 
the spot of rust, and dip the spot in cold water, then in 
the acid, and then in rapidly boiling w^ater, holding it 
in the steam a few minutes. If the spot does not quickly 
disappear, repeat the pi^cess. The steam seems to be 
necessary with the acid. Then rinse thoroughly. 



AN 
OUTLINE OF STUDY FOR TEACHERS. 



FOOD: 
ITS USES, CLASSIFICATION, AND PROPORTION. 

Webster defines food as " anything that supports and nour- 
ishes life." 

The kingdom of nature is divided into organic and inorganic 
bodies. Organic bodies have life ; inorganic bodies are without 
life. Organic bodies are composed of several reciprocal parts, 
each of which is necessary to, and dependent upon, all the other 
parts. Organic bodies, therefore, include plants and animals, and 
inorganic bodies include earths, metals, and minerals. Organic 
bodies spring from some parent or immediate producing agent ; 
they are supported by means of nourishment, and die without it; 
they increase in size by the addition of new particles of matter 
to all parts of their substances. Inorganic bodies are formed by 
some chemical law or union, and grow only by addition to their 
surfaces. 

Organic and inorganic bodies are continually wasting away or 
wearing out. AVaste takes place in all objects, animate and in- 
animate. The minutest change in position in any plant, ani- 
mal, or rock cannot be effected without some loss of substance. 
It has always been beyond the power of man to make anything 
that would not wear out. But there is this important distinction 
between organic and inorganic bodies. Only organic bodies can 
repair their waste, and add to their substance; they alone have 
life, or vital force. When anything wears out in a stone or a 
steam-engine, there is no power in the stone or the engine to 
replace the lost matter; and when a plant or an animal dies, 
the power of repairing waste is gone from it forever. Hence it 
is with animate bodies, or bodies endowed with life, that we have 
to do in considering the subject of food.

45 O The Boston Cook Book. 

Life is that form of energy in creation that results in de- 
velopment from within the object. The energy may be purely 
physical, as in plants; or it may involve mental and moral 
considerations, as in animals. 

There are some essential distinctions between the various 
forms of organic life. Animals grow proportionally in all direc- 
tions, and, at a certain time of life, attain their average size. 
Plants grow upwards and downwards from a collet only, and 
continue to grow through a term of existence. Animals feed 
upon organic matter, consume oxygen from the air, and throw 
off carbonic acid ; plants feed upon inorganic matter, consume 
carbonic acid, and restore oxygen to the air. 

Living plants or vegetables are, with few exceptions, fixed to 
the spot of earth from which they spring, and receive their 
nourishment from external sources. It is furnished them by 
the soil, air, light, and heat by w^hich they are surrounded; and 
they are every moment receiving all that is necessary for their 
sustenance. If one of these essential conditions be withdrawn, 
death follows. Living animals have the power of locomotion, 
and, being obliged to wander, they are not always directly in 
contact wnth their sources of nourishment. They have, there- 
fore, a storehouse in which they lay up at intervals a supply 
of material. The possession of this stomach, or storehouse, 
characterizes all animal beings. 

The changes that occur in animal life are more rapid and 
variable than those in vegetable life. Not being, like vegeta- 
bles, always in connection with their food, animals need some 
monitor to warn them when to seek it. This is provided them 
in the appetite, or the sensations of hunger and thirst. There is 
also a pleasure in the regulated indulgence of these sensations, 
which never fails to insure attention to their demands. 

The vegetable kingdom is the original source of all organic 
matter. All our food is derived directly from the vegetable 
world, or indirectly through animals which have been nourished 
on vegetable products. The ox and sheep, which are consumed 
in the form of beef and mutton, have not fed on flesh, but on 
grass, hay, oats, and other grains. It is only under exposure to 
the sun's rays that plants will grow. Hence to its influence 
we must refer the production of food in the first instance, and 
therefore the sustenance of all life. 

Life and growth in human beings are dependent upon two 
conditions, — motion and warmth. 

Motion. — Our bodies are constantly in motion. The heart 



Food, 451 

and lungs move with every breath. Eveiy thought causes some 
change in the brain. Whenever any part of the body loses its 
power of motion, it dies. All this motion, whether voluntary or 
involuntary, results in the gradual wasting away of the flesh, 
blood, and bones of which the body is composed. " We begin 
to die as soon as we begin to live." If the worn-out materials 
be not replaced, we die. One great object of food is to supply 
this waste. The demand for building material is greatest when 
the body is in a state of activity. Until the human body has 
attained its complete growth, there should be a constant supply 
of material for 7iew growth, as well as for repair. In maturity, 
or when, from bodily inactivity, there is less waste, a smaller 
supply will suffice. Food taken at regular intervals supplies 
means of growth, and repairs the worn-out tissues. 

Warmth. — The temperature of the living human body is about 
98°. In hot or cold climates, in summer or winter, though the 
temperature of the external parts may vary, the internal tempera- 
ture is the same ; and if not maintained within a few degrees of 
this point, death invariably follows. The source of this animal 
heat, so independent of outside circumstances, must be from 
within. To keep up this internal heat or fire, a constant supply 
of fuel is necessary. This fuel is supplied by our food. To fur- 
nish material for growth and repair, and to provide fuel for the 
warmth of the body, is the twofold object of food. 

Animal Combustion. — The process by which food maintains 
the motion and warmth of the body is a kind of combustion, 
and has often been compared to the combustion carried on in 
the steam-engine (see Youmans's Chemistry). We can have no 
combustion without oxygen; therefore oxygen is the first impor- 
tant element of food. The air is our great source of supply of 
oxygen, and a volume might be written on the necessity for 
pure air and perfect ventilation. We breathe oxygen from the 
air into our lungs, and exhale carbonic acid. There must there- 
fore have been some internal union of carbon or hydrogen with 
oxygen, and such a union always produces heat. The carbon 
and hydrogen are obtained from our food, and are important 
elements. They are necessary for animal combustion. 

Food is taken in a natural or in a prepared state, and, after 
undergoing certain processes of digestion and assimilation, be- 
comes a part of our bodies for a time, and then is burned in the 
body, the process resembling somewhat the burning of wood and 
coal in our grates. But this union of carbon and oxygen, '"in- 
stead of taking place in one spot and so rapidly as to be accom- 



452 The Boston Cook Booh. 

panied by light, as in the case of the grate fire, takes place in 
each drop of the blood, and so slowly and continuously as not to 
be noticed." The force and heat absorbed from the sun by the 
vegetable in growing, and stored in its starch and sugar, are set 
free, by the decomposition of the vegetable, into carbonic acid 
and water again. These are given out, partly as heat, keeping 
the body temperature at 98°; and partly in other forms, — in 
that of mechanical motion, etc. 

All the external or internal work of the body is done by 
the force and energy of the food which is burnt therein. The 
greater the amount of work to be done, the greater must be the 
supply of fuel. The fire is constantly burning. " The smoke 
passes out in exhalation, inhalation is the bellows to furnish 
more oxygen," and food supplies the fuel. The kidneys are 
the grates through which the ashes are removed. But if we 
are " a house on fire," why are we not consumed? Because, 
lest this internal fire burn too freely, the oxygen of the air is 
diluted with nitrogen, which is incombustible. The blood, 
bones, and muscles of the body are composed largely of nitro- 
gen, sixteen per cent of that element being present; and this 
prevents the complete burning up of the structure. " What the 
iron is to the stove, the nitrogenous tissues are to the body." 
But the stove wears out in time, and so our bodies are con- 
stantly wasting away ; and these nitrogenous elements must be 
supplied by our food. 

Food, to accomplish its purpose fully, should consist of these 
four elements: oxygen, to support combustion, — obtained from 
the air; carbon and hydrogen^ to furnish fi^el, — obtained from 
water and carbonaceous food ; nitrogen^ to build up and repair 
the tissues of the body, — obtained from nitrogenous food. 

Food, in the form in which it is eaten, cannot sustain life. • 
It must be converted into a fluid that can pass through very 
small channels into the blood. Then it must be mixed with the 
air, and undergo certain changes, before it can replace the worn- 
out elements of the body. To prepare food so that it can most 
readily be assimilated, that is, made like our bodies, should be 
the chief purpose in cocking. To do this, three things are 
essential : 1st. The food selected should be of the right mate- 
rial, and properly proportioned; 2d. It should be cooked in the 
most digestible and attractive manner; 3d. It should be adapted 
to the various circumstances of age, occupation, climate, and 
state of health. 

Food, to be of the right material, should contain all the ele- 



Human Body. 453 



ments that our bodies contain. It is of primary importance, 
then, in studying food, to understand first the composition of the 
human body. 



THE COMPOSITION OF THE HUMAN BODY. 

Our bodies are made up of different materials: skin, flesh, 
blood, bone, etc. These consist of a large number of substances, 
called compounds; the compounds contain two, three, or four 
elements, united chemically in definite proportion. Some of 
these compounds are: ivater, which forms more than two thirds 
of the whole body, and is the common carrier of food into and 
through the system; fibr'me, which is the chief solid material of 
flesh, and forms one tenth of the body; fat, a mixture of three 
compounds, distributed all through the system; albumen, and 
other nitrogenous substances, of which osseine in bones, keratin 
in the hair, nails, and skin, cartilagin in cartilage, and liemo- 
globin, which contains iron and gives the red color to the blood, 
are the most important. Chloride of sodium, or common salt, 
and other mineral salts of pofas.'^a, lime, and magnesia, are 
found in all parts of the body. These compounds are made up 
of two or more separate and distinct elements. 

There are sixteen elements in the human body, — oxygen, 
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, fluo- 
rine, silicon, calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, 
manganese, and copper. Compounds only, not the separate ele- 
ments, are capable of nourishing the body. Oxygen only exists 
as an element. Its office is to support combustion. 

Combinations of two or more of these elements are found in 
the various articles used as food. It is quite important that our 
food should consist of various materials, containing elements 
similar to, or capable of being changed into, the elements of our 
bodies, of which the most important are: water, to help diges- 
tion and assimilation of food, and to help carry away refuse 
material; salts, to renew the mineral parts and replenish certain 
tissues; carbon, to furnish fuel for warmth; nitrogen, to build up 
and repair the whole structure. 

For convenience the elements are classified chemically into 
Non-Combustibles, or inorganic compounds, including ivater and 
salts; Combustibles, or organic compounds, including carbona- 
ceous and nitrogenous foods. Some foods contain no carbon, 
some contain no nitrogen, and some have all the elements io 



454 The Boston Cook Book, 

various proportions. Food has been classified into gaseous, oi 
air; liquid, or water; and solid, including animal and vegetable 
foods. But the division into carbonaceous, or heat-producing, 
and nitrogenous, or flesh-forming foods, answers every purpose.

Water forms more than two thirds of the whole body. It 
is especially abundant in the blood and secretions. It gives 
them the necessary fluidity, and enables them to dissolve the 
important materials they contain. It is contained in all kinds 
of solid food, as well as in the liquids drunk as beverages. It 
is most abundant in fruits and vegetables. Every pound of 
perfectly dry food should be accompanied with four pounds of 
water. 

Pure water is composed of ox^^gen and hydrogen, one ninth 
hydrogen and eight ninths oxygen by weight. The usual test 
for pure drinking water is that it be " free from color, smell, or 
taste, be soft, bright, and aerated, and free from all deposit." 
But it is very seldom found in that condition, as its power of 
dissolving other substances is so great that it nearly always 
holds animal, vegetable, or mineral matters in solution, obtained 
from the earth through which it flows. It also absorbs gases 
and odors from the air. The animal and vegetable substances 
found in it render it impure. But the mineral matters, unless 
in excess, are not objectionable. 

When water contains more than a few grains to the gallon of 
carbonate of lime, it is termed hard water. When water is hard 
or impure, it should be boiled before being used for drinking, 
as this destroys the vegetable and animal impurities. 

Water evaporates at all temperatures, boils at 212°, and freezes 
at 32° Fahrenheit. In freezing, the substances dissolved in 
water are expelled. Water, as it approaches the freezing-point, 
expands, and often bursts the vessels in which it is contained. 
In ponds or rivers it expands, becomes lighter, freezes, and 
floats on the surface in the form of ice. 

Water is perfectly neutral. It combines with acids and with 
bases. It becomes sweet, sour, salt, astringent, bitter, or poison- 
ous, according to the nature of the bodies it holds in solution. 



Salts. 45 5 

Salts and other Mineral Matters. — The chief purpose of min- 
eral ingredients is to replenish certain tissues, and aid in the 
transferrence and absorption of the combustible nutrients, as a 
scaffolding aids in the construction of a building. 

Chloride of sodium, or common salt, is essential to the life of 
the higher animals. It exists in all parts of the body. It is 
more abundant in the blood than any other inorganic ingredient 
except water ; but it is an active poisonous irritant if taken in 
excess, causing diseases of the mucous membranes, as in catarrh, 
and stiffening of the muscles, as in rheumatism. We take it as 
a natural ingredient in many kinds of food, and as a condiment 
to increase the relish of many others. 

The desire for salt is instinctive. There are people who do 
not use salt in food, but it is probable that they obtain sufficient 
sodium and chlorine in the brackish water they drink; or it may 
be, their habits of life render less salt necessary. 

Salt must be added plentifully to all vegetable food. The 
bad effects of a salt-meat diet can be counteracted by the use of 
lemon juice and fresh green vegetables, which are rich in potash 
salts. 

Salt taken with our food supplies two substances. Its chlo- 
rine supplies the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, that 
helps digest our food; and soda, which is an element of the bile, — 
a fluid which must be added to the dissolved or softened food 
before the nourishment can be extracted from it. People would 
very soon become ill if deprived of salt. A person requires 
from one fourth to half an ounce of salt daily. The attractive 
flavor which is developed by cooking and adding salt to our food 
excites the secretion of saliva and gastric juice, and therefore 
helps digestion. The Dutch used to condemn criminals to a 
diet of unsalted food. They suffered great physical torture, 
which soon ended in death. 

Salt is one of the most abundant of all minerals. It is ob- 
tained from springs by evaporation, and from natural mines. 
It is readily soluble in hot or cold water. It is used for packing 
and preserving meats, as it prevents putrefaction by absorbing 
water from the flesh. 

The other mineral ingredients needed in the system are com- 
binations of lime, soda, potash, magnesia, sulphur, phosphorus, and 
iron. Phosphorus, lime, and magnesia are found in meat, fish, 
the cereals, and potatoes. Potash is found in meat, fish, milk, 
vegetables, and the dry seeds and fleshy parts of fruits, iron, 
in flesh, vegetables, and nearly all food, in vG/y minute quantities. 



456 The Boston Cook Book. 

Sulphur is in fibriiie, albumen, and caseine. There is sufficient 
saline matter, except common salt, in all the ordinary food we 
eat and the water we drink. 

These mineral matters become rearranged and combined 
before becoming part of the body, but they do not undergo any 
chemical change or decomposition. They are absorbed with 
the food, and form for a time part of the animal tissues, after 
which they are discharged with the secretions, and replaced by 
a fresh supply. They are absolutely indispensable to the nour- 
ishment of the body. 



COMBUSTIBLE COMPOUNDS. 



CARBONACEOUS FOODS. 

The first division of combustible compounds is called carbon- 
aceous because they all contain carbon; or heat-producing^ be- 
cause by their burning they generate heat. They consist of 
starch, sugar, fats and oils, gum, and the softer fibres of plants. 
They are found in vegetables, cereals, fruits, milk, eggs, and 
the fat of meat. 

Starch. 

Starch is one of the most important of vegetable foods; it 
is found in grains, seeds, and roots^ and in the pith and bark 
of plants. When pure, it is a snow-white, glistening powder. 
It consists of exceedingly minute grains, varying in size and 
shape in the different kinds of starch. These grains are cov- 
ered with an outer skin which is insoluble and unchanged by 
cold water ; but in boiling, this membrane bursts and the inte- 
rior of each grain dissolves in the water, forming a thick, 
gummy solution. When cool, it stiffens into a kind of pasty 
mass. 

Starchy food is very unwholesome unless properly cooked, 
ft must be mixed with a sufficient amount of liquid, and sub- 
jected to a great degree of heat, that the grains may swell and 
burst. This liquid is sometimes supplied by the boiling water 
in which certain starchy foods are cooked; and sometimes by fat 
which melts with the heat, as in pastry, or by boiling fat, as in 
anything fried. When flour or starchy food is mixed with fat, 
it should be finely and evenly mixed, that the fat may penetrate 



Starch. 457 



every part of the flour, or else it will cake, and all the grains 
will not burst. Anything that helps to make pastry lighter 
and the fat more evenly distributed, causes the starch grains to 
burst equally, and makes such food more wholesome. 

Vegetables should be put into boiling water to burst the 
starch cells, and set free the confined air, of which there is a 
great deal in many kinds. They should be taken up as soon 
as they are soft, as they absorb water after the grains are fully 
burst. 

Starch in its uncooked, insoluble state is not digested by the 
human stomach. Seeds and fruits which consist of starch, 
especially if it be combined with oil, as in many nuts, if eaten 
uncooked, are very difficult to digest. 

All starchy articles of food should be masticated thoroughly, 
and mixed with the saliva. It is more necessary to chew bread 
and potatoes well than meat. Starch is changed by various 
means into sugar. If an acid be added to it in a watery solu- 
tion, and boiled, it becomes clear and transparent, and after a 
time all the starch disappears, and sugar takes its place. The 
same change is caused by the saliva, and during digestion the 
starch is all changed into sugar, so that none of it is found in 
the fluids and secretions of the body. This is easily seen by 
chewing pure starch ; after a while it will become sweet. 

Starch contains no albuminous substances, and therefore 
cannot supply any of the materials of which our bodies are 
formed. But it is the source of the warmth of our bodies, and 
the strength we exert. Taken alone, it would be useless as an 
article of food. It must have the addition of albuminoid and 
fatty substances, like milk or meat. 

Starch is prepared by grinding some vegetable matter that 
contains it in abundance, and mixing it with cold water. The 
water is strained and allowed to stand; the starch settles at the 
bottom, and is then dried and powdered. Cornstarch is ob- 
tained from Indian corn, by a chemical process. The gluti- 
nous, oily elements are freed from the seed by alkaline solutions, 
and the starchy parts are ground and dried. Sago is starch 
from the pith of a species of palm-tree. Tapioca is from the 
root of a species of the cassava plant of South America- It is a 
coarsely granulated substance. Cassava, or mandioc, is a more 
finely granulated form of the same root. Arrowroot is from 
the rhizoma, or rootstalk, of a West Indian plant. The natives 
use the roots of a species of the plant in extracting the poison 
of arrows ; hence the name. 



458 The Boston Cook Boole. 



Sugar. 

Sugar is composed of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. There 
are three kmds, — cane sugar, or sucrose; grape sugar, or glu- 
cose; milk sugar, or lactose. 

Cane sugar as an article of food closely resembles starch, but 
it is soluble and therefore more easily digested. It is readily 
distinguished by its sweet taste. It is found in many animal 
juices and also in fruits, but exists mainly in vegetable juices 
which have little or no acid in their sap, like sugar cane, rock 
maple, and beet-root. In its natural state-it is dissolved in the 
vegetable fluids, mingled with many other substances. It is 
obtained by crushing the raw material ; the fluids thus obtained 
are heated with a solution of lime, which causes the impurities 
to separate and rise in scum. These are removed, and the 
purified juice boiled down until it solidifies as a brownish de- 
posit. This brown sugar is again dissolved, boiled, and filtered 
through charcoal, evaporated, and crystallized. Molasses is the 
drainage of the raw sugar. Brown sugar is the first product. 
Granulated sugar is brown sugar refined and re-crystallized. 
All brown and moist sugars are inferior in quality; they contain 
water and mineral matter, and are sometimes infested by a 
minute insect. Loaf sugar is the purest. 

Sucrose, or cane sugar, is changed, by the acids of the gastric 
juice and the nitrogenous matter of the food, into grape sugar, 
or glucose. One of the most remarkable properties of sugar is 
that it can be decomposed and converted into other substances 
by fermentation. In its chemical relations sugar ranks with 
acids, and combines with bases, as in sugar of lead. It melts at 
€)'2(f, and by cooling forms a transparent amber-colored solid 
known as barley sugar. If heated to 420°, it forms a brown 
mass, called caramel. Sugar has great preservative powers, 
and is used in preserving fruits, hams, bacon, etc. 

Glucoae, or grape sugar, is abundantly distributed throughout 
the vegetable kingdom. It is found in honey, figs, grapes, and 
other fruits which have acid juices. It is less sweet than cane 
sugar, and is immediately absorbed into the circulation when 
taken into the stomach. It is less soluble and less easily 
crystallized than sucrose. 

Lactose, or milk sugar, is obtained only from the milk of mam- 
malia. It has the composition of cane sugar, and is converted 
into grape sugar when taken as food. 



Fats. 459 



Fats. 

Fats, or oleaginous substances, are composed of carbon, hydro- 
gen, and oxygen, — the two former elements preponderating, 
— and, having a very strong afl&nity for oxygen, are highly 
combustible. 

Fats are solid; oils are liquid. Fats may be changed to oil by 
a slight accession of heat, and are obtained from both animal 
and vegetable tissues, — suet and dripping, from beef fat; lard, 
from the fat of pigs; butter, from the creailPbf milk; olive oil, 
from the fleshy pulp. of the fruit of the olive tree. Oil is also 
found in nuts, seeds, cereals, and fruits. Croton oil, used for 
medicinal purposes, is from a plant, a native of India; cod liver 
oil, from the liver of cod fish ; castor oil, from the seeds of the 
castor-oil plant. 

Fats and oils contain three different oleaginous substances, 
known as stearine, margarine, and oleine. Oleine is that portion 
of oil that causes its fluidity. It is more abundant in oils than 
fats, and in the fat of swine than in the harder fat of sheep or 
beef. Lard is better than mutton fat or suet for frying, because, 
having more oleine, it can be converted into a liquid sooner. 
Margarine is harder than oleine. It exists in human fat, in but- 
ter, and olive oil. Stearine is the most solid substance of the 
three, and is most abundant in tallow and suet. 

The peculiar odor some fats and oils possess is from the pres- 
ence of an acid. In butter it is butyric acid. Glycerine is the 
base common to all the fats. In stearine, the hardest fat, it 
unites with stearic acid; in margarine, a less solid form, with 
margaric acid; in oleine, or oil, with oleic acid. 

" Fat forms the chief material of adipose tissue. It serves to 
fill spaces and give rotundity and beauty to the form, to equalize 
external pressure, to diminish the friction of the parts, to give 
suppleness to the tissues, and, being a non-conductor of heat, to 
keep the body warm. An undue accumulation of fat is a species 
of disease." 

Oils and fats will not mix with water; but if an alkaline sub- 
stance, like potash or soda, be added, the oil becomes separated 
into fine particles, and is held suspended in the watery fluid. 
This is called an emulsion, and this is what takes place in intes- 
tinal digestion. The gastric juice, being acid, does not digest 
fat, but only separates it from these substances, that it may 
digest the albuminous portions with wJiich it is mingled. But 



460 The Boston Cook Book. 

the pancreatic fluid, being alkaline, resolves the fat into an 
emulsion. This completes the digestion, then the fats are ab- 
sorbed and received into the general circulation. Having a 
strong affinity for oxygen, these fatty particles in the venous 
blood, when they come in contact with the oxygen of the air, 
burn, and heat is evolved. The power of fat in maintaining 
heat and activity is two and a half times that of starch. 

Oils which are used as food are Jixed oils. Volatile oils are 
found in many condiments and perfumes. Volatile oils can be 
distilled, or changed to vapor, and recondensed into their origi- 
nal form; they leave no permanent stain on paper. Fixed or 
greasy oils cannot be distilled; before changing to vapor they 
recombine into new compounds. 

Gum, Mucilage, Pectose, and Cellulose. 

These are combustible compounds, but are neither starchy, 
saccharine, nor oily. Gum is found in apple and plum trees. 
Gum arable is from a species of acacia, and is soluble. Muci- 
lage is found in onions, quinces, and flaxseed. It forms a jelly 
with water, but does not dissolve like gum arable. Pectose is 
found in many roots, like the turnip; also in the pear and peach. 
When boiled with water it changes to a vegetable jelly, called 
pectine. Currants, pears, peaches, plums, contain pectine, and 
this is what gives firmness to the preserves made from them. 
Cellulose is the woody fibre of stalks of grain, the membrane 
which envelops the grains, husks, and skin of seeds, rinds, 
cores, and stones of fruits. It is the main and almost the sole 
constituent of linen, and of the paper which is made from linen. 

NITROGENOUS FOODS. 

The second division of the Combustible Compounds is called 
nitrogenous, or fiesli-forming foods. Nitrogen is the flesh-form- 
ing element common to all foods. It enters largely into the 
composition of the body, forming sixteen per cent of the 
animal tissue. A liberal supply is necessary to form and 
repair tissue. Although the atmosphere is four fifths nitro- 
gen, we get no supply from that source. It must be sup- 
plied in a state of combination, not as an element, from such 
compounds as have been produced under the influence of life. 
We require organic nitrogenous matter, and not pure nitrogen. 
This is sometimes derived from vegetable sources, but is most 



Alhuminons Food. 461 

abundant in animal substances. Animal food is richer and 
more nutritious than vegetable food; but the latter, if taken in 
large quantities, yields the same amount of flesh-forming mate- 
rial. Nitrogenous substances in plants and animals are identical 
in composition; and, from whichever source they are taken, the 
most important consideration is, to digest them and make them 
into blood. 

Nitrogen is an essential part of some of our most powerful 
medicines, like quinine and morphine, and of our most dangerous 
poisons, such as strychnine and prussic acid. 

Nitrogenous foods are also called albumijwus, because albumen 
is their common element, though it is called by different names 
in different things. Albumen is from albiis, meaning white. The 
principal varieties of albuminous food are lean meat, fish, eggs, 
nrilk, cheese, peas, beans, oatmeal, flour, rye, and corn. These 
are treated more fully in other parts of the book, in chapters on 
Bread, Meats, Fish, Eggs, Milk, and Vegetables. 

The albuminous portion of meat is the juice, or albumen, and 
the fibre, or fibrine. In eggs it is the white. In milk it is the 
caseine, or the curdy part that separates when milk has soured. 
In peas and beans it is called vegetable caseine. In flour it 
is gluten, — the sticky, glutinous substance which is left after 
squeezing or washing out the starch. 

Albumen exists in two states, — one soluble in water and one 
insokible. The soluble may be changed to insoluble by heating 
to 120°, or by adding nitric acid. It is the most easily digested 
of all flesh-forming foods. 

Albuminous substances have the property of coagulation; but 
all albuminoids do not coagulate in the same way. The albumen 
of eggs and the juices of meat coagulate by heating to the boiling- 
point. The fibrine of the blood coagulates when exposed to the 
air. Milk coagulates by the addition of an acid. 

Albuminous substances also have the property oi fermentation. 
This occurs principally in substances which are rich in sugar, 
starch, and gluten, like flour, milk, etc. The fermentation in 
flour and milk is explained in the chapter on Bread-Making. 

Fermentation will not take place without air or moisture, and 
a moderate degree of heat. Therefore, if albuminous substances 
be excluded from air and moisture, and kept very hot or very 
cold, they will not ferment. Fermentation is a change in the 
elements of a body composed of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. 
Sugar is composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in equal 
parts; when sugar ferments, it decomposes and then reunites in 



462 The Boston Cook Book. 

different proportions, forming different compounds, — alcohol, 
carbonic acid, and water. 

Albuminous substances are the only substances which putrefy. 
Putrefaction resembles fermentation, and is due to the presence, 
in large proportion, of the fickle element, nitrogen, and also to 
the laro-e number of elements combined in all albuminous sub- 
stances. Complicated machinery is always more easily deranged 
than simple; and in all chemical combinations, the more com- 
plex they are, the more unstable. Nitrogen has a very weak 
affinity for other elements, and forms very mistable compounds. 
All substances rich in nitrogen, when exposed to the air, soon 
pass into a state of decomposition, or putrefaction. The oxygen 
of the air has a greater affinity than the nitrogen for the other 
elements, and unites with them very easily. In putrefaction 
the oxygen unites with the carbon to form carbonic acid, 
and with the hydrogen to form water. The hydrogen and 
nitrogen unite and form ammonia, and this occasions the 
peculiar, unpleasant odor of all putrefying bodies. In sub- 
stances rich in sulphur and phosphorus, the hydrogen unites 
with them and forms sulphuretted and phosphoretted gases 
which are very offensive. Therefore, if we exclude the air or 
oxygen from such substances, we can arrest decomposition. 
This is done by keeping them* in air-tight vessels, thus remov- 
ing the oxygen from the outside ; and by boiling or dr^dng, to 
remove that which is diffused within. Freezing will have the 
same effect; also salting or preserving. The salt draws out the 
moisture, hardens the albumen, and prevents the access of 
oxygen. In preserving, by the use of a strong solution of sugar, 
the watery juices are drawn out and formed into a thick syrup 
which excludes the air. 

There are some albuminous substances, such as isinglass and 
gelatine, which are taken as food ; but, strictly speaking, they 
are not jiesli- formers. Isinglass is obtained from the sound, 
or swimming bladder, of the sturgeon, and is imported from 
Russia. It is not actually gelatine, but is transformed into it 
by boiling water. Gelatine is obtained from bones. Ossein is 
that part of the bones to which their strength and elasticity are 
due. It is insoluble in cold water, but is slowly dissolved and 
changed into gelatine by being boiled gently under a pressure 
sufficient to prevent the escape of steam. Gelatine is also ob- 
tained from tendons, calves' feet, fish scales, stag's horns, etc. 

There are other varieties of nitrogenous food which are also 
carbonaceous. These are commonly included under the general 



Milh. 463 

term Beverages ; namely, tea, coffee, cocoa, and chocolate. The 
nitrogenous j)rincij)le of tea is theine; of coffee, caffeine; and of 
chocolate, theobromine. Tea also contains iron and manganese. 

Drinks, Beverages, and Liquid Foods are classified as follows : 
water, including rain, well, and mineral spring water; mucilagi- 
nous, farinaceous, or saccharine drinks, including toast water, 
Irish moss, and barley water, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, and other 
gruels; aromatic or astringent drinks, including, tea, coffee, choco* 
late, cocoa, and herb teas; acidulous drinks, including lemonade, 
raspberry vinegar, and other fruit syrups ; animal broths, or drinks 
containing gelatine, including soups, broths, and beef tea; emul- 
sive drinks, including milk ; alcoholic and intoxicating drinks, 
including wines, cider, beer, ale, porter, brandy, and whiskey. 

Water is discussed under Xon-Combustible Foods. Receipts 
for mucilaginous and acidulous drinks, animal broths, and herb 
teas are given in the chapter on Cookery for the Sick. The 
aromatic drinks are included in a separate article under the head 
of Beverages. Alcoholic drinks will not be discussed for want 
of space. Milk is food as well as drink, and deserves especial 
consideration. 

Milk. 

Milk consists of three distinct substances, which separate 
from one another after standing awhile, — the cream, curd, 
and whey. 

The cream is the carbonaceous part, and forms ten or twelve 
per cent of the whole. It consists of very small globules of fat, 
or butter, invisible to the naked eye, surrounded by a fine mem- 
brane of caseine or albuminous matter. These are dispersed in 
the milk at first; but as they are lighter than the other parts, 
they rise to the top of the milk in the form of cream. When the 
cream is churned, the membrane of each globule is ruptured, 
causing the butter to cohere in a separate mass. If all this 
caseine, or albuminous matter, be not removed, the butter soon 
becomes rancid. The butter has more margarine than oleine, 
and is therefore hard and firm instead of fluid. It contains 
butyric acid, which gives it its peculiar flavor. 

The curd is the albuminous part of the milk, which separates 
in a solid form whenever milk sours or curdles. This separa- 
tion is occasioned by the action of the oxygen in the air upon 
the nitrogen in the caseine, causing a portion of the caseine to 
ferment. This ferment acts upon the sugar of the milk, and 
converts it into lactic acid ; and this acid acts as any other acid 



464 The Boston Cook Book, 

would, and causes the sourness of the milk. The caseine is in- 
soluble in water, but in the milk it is combined with soda, and 
this compound is soluble. So, when the milk sours, and a suffi- 
cient quantity of acid is formed, it seizes upon the soda, takes it 
away from the caseine, and forms lactate of soda. The caseine, 
being thus set free, shrinks, and gathers into an insoluble curdy 
mass. This separation is spontaneous; but it is often caused 
artificially, by the use of an acid, — usually rennet, which is the 
lining membrane of a calf's stomach. The curd thus separated 
is pressed and prepared in various forms of cheese. It contains 
the nutritious elements of the milk in a condensed, but somewhat 
indigestible form. Cheese is more digestible when made from 
fresh than from skimmed milk. 

The whey is the water of the milk that separates from the curd 
In souring, and contains dissolved in it the sugar of milk and the 
saline and mineral ingredients. It is much better to use milk 
in its natural state than to use the butter or cheese obtained 
from it. It is the cheapest form in which animal food can be 
obtained, and should be used freely, especially by the young or 
weak. 

Condensed milk, when well prepared, is convenient and valu- 
able as an article of diet, if fresh milk cannot be obtained. It 
can only be made from pure milk, and is therefore perfectly 
harmless. 



CONDIMENTS. 

There is another class of foods, called condiments^ which should 
not pass unnoticed. 

Food that " tastes good " is digested more readily, and assimi- 
lated more perfectly, so that we really derive more nourishment 
from it. We use many articles with our food to make it taste 
better, which are not in themselves valuable as food. But by 
stimulating the flow of saliva and gastric juice, and enhancing 
the fine flavor of food, they increase the pleasure of eating, and 
render digestion more complete. These are called condiments. 
They are not necessary to persons of sound digestion, and, with 
the exception of salt, should not be used by children, nor by any 
one in large quantities. In perfect digestion there is the first 
taste in the mouth and the after-taste of the digestive organs 
which require satisfaction. " Any cook may gratify the first, 
but the second requires a skilled chemist." 



Con dim ents. 46 5 



The principal condiments are salt, pepper, mustard, and some 
herbs, including mint, thyme, parsley, sage, marjoram, summer 
savoiy, and bay leaves; spices, including ginger, nutmeg, cinna- 
mon, clove, mace, and allspice; and flavorings or extracts of 
lemon, vanilla, orange, almond, pineapple, etc. 

Salt is the only condiment actually necessary to health (see 
page 455) . 

Pepper is a stimulant when taken in small quantities, but irri- 
tating if taken in excess. It is the dried berry of a climbing 
plant of the piper family. The whole peppers are called pepper- 
corns. These peppercorns are ground, and we have black pepper. 
The outer shells are sometimes removed before grinding, and 
these kernels ground give us white pepper, which has a different 
flavor and is less pungent than black pepper. Red or Cayenne 
pepper consists of seed-vessels or pods of different species of 
capsicum ground to powder. It is stimulating, and far more 
wholesome than the black pepper, though not as much used. It 
is valuable as a medicine. 

Mustard is used as a condiment and medicine. It is made 
from seeds of black and white mustard, which are crushed be- 
tween rollers, and then pounded in mortars. In small quantities 
it is good for diijestion. Both red pepper and mustard, if used 
sparingly with indigestible food, like lobster and baked beans, 
are very useful. 

The herbs are used dried or green, and when used judiciously, 
make meats, soups, and sauces more palatable. 

Spices are used in cakes and articles of food containing sugar, 
and sometimes with meats. They are used whole, ground, and 
in the extract. Ginger is the most healthful, and is often used 
in sickness. It is a valuable stimulating tonic in hot weather. 
The other spices are better when mixed in small quantities, less 
of clove and more of cinnamon being used. When combined so 
that no one spice predominates, they are pleasant to the taste. 
Care should be taken lest they hide the natural flavor of tbe 
food. 

Flavors are all good in small quantities. Almond, vanilla, 
lemon, and pineapple are often adulterated. They should never 
be added while the article is hot, as the heat wastes the strength 
of the flavor. Vanilla beans are better than the extract. It is 
always well, if possible, to use the fresh fruit juice. 

Lemon juice and vinegar, used in moderation, increase the sol- 
vent properties of the gastric juice, and are useful with meats 
and vegetables which are difficult of digestion.

PROPER PROPORTION OF FOOD. 

These different kinds of food, luater, salts, sugar, starch, fat, 
and albumen, must be combined in our diet; for a simple sub- 
stance which fulfils only one of the purposes required in oui 
food will not support life. A man cannot live on water or salt, 
yet he would soon die without them. A diet composed exclu- 
sively of fats, starch, or sugar is equally incapable of supporting 
life. The albuminous foods, though they are considered the most 
nutritious, must be combined with the others to produce the 
desired result. 

Milk is the only substance prepared by nature expressly as an 
article of food. Seeds grow, and produce plants and fruits after 
their kind; but milk is prepared as the natural food of the 
young of all mammalia. A baby fed on milk develops in every 
part; therefore milk must supply every requisite for the growth 
of the young body, and the proportions in woman's milk may be 
taken as the standard for human food. Milk analyzed is found 
to contain water, salt, fat, sugar, and caseine, — the five ele- 
ments of food. It has enough of flesh -producing elements to 
restore the daily waste, and enough heat-giving elements to feed 
the oxygen in breathing. But when the teeth are formed, the 
child's system needs a greater proportion of some elements than 
are supplied by the milk, and other foods are gradually added 
to the diet. 

Eggs also contain all the necessary elements ; a diet of seven 
eggs per day furnishes all the nutrition a person needs. But 
the elements in eggs are too highly condensed, and are not 
properly proportioned for a continuous diet. 

Many articles of food do not contain all these elements, and 
it is very important to proportion our food rightly, so that one 
kind will supply what another lacks. A certain bulk is also 
necessary in our food to stimulate a thorough action of the diges- 
tive fluids. If the quantity be not sufficient to distend the 
stomach, so that the churning motion of the nmscular coats can 
affect every part of the food, the digestion is imperfect. Dys- 
pepsia is often caused by lack of sufficient quantity of food, and 
by weakness of the muscles of the stomach. If this requisite 
quantity be wholly nutritious or highly condensed food, capable 
of entire absorption, the effect is too stimulating, and serious 
disorders of the alimentary canal are the result. To remedy 
this, it is necessary to have a certain amount of innutritious 



Proportion of Food. 467 

food, which furnishes the bulk required, and gives all parts of 
the digestive apparatus their proper amount of work to perform. 

Many persons argue in favor of a vegetable diet, as we can 
obtain from vegetables al) the ne-^essary elements. There have 
been many cases known where people lived to an extreme age 
who used exclusively a vegetable diet, and others who lived 
equally as long upon animal food. But the general rule is, that 
we find the highest degree of bodily and mental vigor only 
among those who make use of a mixed diet. One of the strong- 
est physiological arguments in favor of this rule is found in the 
structure and conformation of the teeth and alimentary canal. 
Part of the teeth are of the carnivorous, or flesh-eating kind, 
and part of the herbivorous, or vegetable-eating kind. The 
alimentary canal is equally well adapted to the digestion of ani- 
mal or vegetable food, or an admixture of both. The proper 
proportion, by weight, is one third of animal, and two thirds of 
vegetable food. 

"Nature has given us an unerring guide to a proper choice of 
diet. An unperverted appetite is the voice of the physical sys- 
tem making known its needs, and it may always be trusted to 
indicate the food necessary to the preservation of health. But 
as the voice of nature is often unheeded, it is necessary to exer- 
cise intelligence in selecting our food and adapting it to the 
circumstances of life. By a proper choice we can often coun- 
teract the effects of a violation of nature's laws." 



ADAPTATION OF FOOD TO CLIMATE, AGE, OCCU- 
PATION, AND STATE OF HEALTH. 

In examining the foods adopted by different nations and 
classes of people, we find that many choose instinctively the 
kind best adapted to their individual needs. The climate, occu- 
pation, and water influence their choice. 

Climate. — Animal food is better for cold than for hot cli- 
mates. We breathe more rapidly, take in more oxygen in cold 
weather, and the internal fire burns up more of the food. We 
exercise more, and this causes more rapid wearing out of muscle 
and flesh. Fat meat is not digested easily unless exercise be 
taken freely; more oxygen must be mixed with it to produce 
heat than is required for sugar and starch. In summer, when 
we exercise less, the waste is less, and we need less warmth-

giving food. The starch and sugar obtained from fruits and 
vegetables are easily digested, and furnish sufficient warmth. 
The Esquimaux or Greenlander consumes a large quantity of 
fat, or blubber oil, the most condensed form of carbonaceous 
food. This gives him the amount of heat necessary in an ex- 
tremely cold climate. With this blubber he mixes some indi- 
gestible substances to give the needed bulk for the perfect 
action of the stomach. The people of Norway, Sweden, and 
Russia use large quantities of oily Jish. In China, India, and 
other extremely hot climates, rice is the universal food. Rice 
contains a very small amount of flesh-forming material, being 
mostly starch, which is changed into sugar by the action of the 
saliva. The natives of rice-eating countries owe much of their 
lack of spirit and energy to this defective diet. But when eaten 
with butter or olive oil, and made into curries, pilaf, and pilau, 
with a small amount of flesh or fish, it supplies all the elements 
necessary for life in such climates. The Spaniard in his olla 
podrida — a stew of peas, bacon, or fowl, with red pepper — finds 
all the necessary elements. The red pepper, used so largely in 
the curries and other dishes common to hot climates, stimulates 
the liver, which is naturally w'eakened by the long-continued 
heat, and thus assists digestion. The Arab chooses dates , parched 
grains, mare's or camel's milk. The Turk adds to these melons 
and cucumbers. As we come northward again, we find more 
flesh-forming material in the polenta (a dish made of Indian 
corn) and the chestnuts, macaroni, and cheese used by the Italians. 
T\\Q jjot-an-feu is the principal djsh of every peasant in France. 
This furnishes the cheapest form of nutriment, and contains all 
the necessary elements of food. 

Tne toaters of a country sometimes determine the national 
food. In Ireland, where the w^aters are strongly impregnated 
with lime, they furnish what the potato, which is richer in pot- 
ash and soda, lacks. When potatoes are combined with cabbage 
and pork, as in kolcannon, the flesh-forming element is supplied; 
and this, on account of the cost of meat, the laboring classes are 
unable to obtain in any other form. In England and Scotland, 
where the waters are soft, oats and wheat, which are rich in 
phosphates, are the staple diet. When combined with milk, 
eggs, rice, peas, beans, bacon, and cheese, their food is complete. 

To satisfy the natural instinct to obtain these five elements, 
we all prefer our bread with butter or cream, our meat with 
potatoes, our rice with butter, milk, or eggs; our fish we cook 
in fat; we eat liver with bacon and ham, or bacon with eggs; 



Choice of Food. 469 



we eat cheese with crackers, butter with cauliflower or cabbage, 
salt with all vegetables, oil with salad, and fresh vegetables with 
salt meat. Fruits and foods intended to be eaten raw contain a 
large proportion of water. This is supplied, when lessened by 
evaporation, by cooking and soaking in water. In cooking 
meats, we endeavor to retain all the juices, which are largely 
water. In spring we crave fresh green vegetables and salads, 
that we may have the potash salts of which there has been a 
deficiency in the winter diet. 

Occupation affects our choice of diet. Persons engaged in sed- 
entary occupations cannot digest as much nor as easily as those 
who labor out of doors. They should have food that gives the 
greatest amount of nourishment in the smallest compass, and it 
should be served in the most digestible form. Those who tax 
their brains severely should have animal food and the most 
digestible forms of starchy and warmth-giving foods. Those 
who exercise freely in the open air may take a larger quantity, 
and it need not be the most digestible, as they require food that 
will stay by them. The laborer instinctively prefers potatoes 
underdone, or "with a bone in them;" and he chooses salt 
meat, not only because it is cheaper, but because it stands by 
him longer. The salt causes him to drink water freely, and 
this supplies the waste caused by excessive perspiration. A 
diet of vegetables, peas, beans, cheese, oatmeal, bacon, and 
the cheaper, more indigestible parts of meat properly cooked, 
is suitable for laboring people. 

State of Health. — In selecting food with reference to health it 
must be remembered that there are certain general rules which 
have been established by the best authorities through many ages 
and in a great variety of circumstances; there are, however, 
some exceptions to these general rules. Milk is considered a 
wholesome food, yet there are some persons who cannot take it. 
Cheese is a cheap and nourishing food for laboring people, but 
there are some persons to whom it is an active poison. This is 
also true of oysters and strawberries. These exceptions are 
owing to some idiosyncrasy of the palate or weakness of the 
digestive organs, and should be regarded only as exceptions, 
which do not affect the general principle. 

The application of these general principles, given throughout 
this book in connection with the various articles used as food, 
must be left to each individual; but to those who have given 
the subject no serious study a few hints may be helpful. They 
will be fouud in the article treating of Cooking for the Invalid.

NOURISHING AND STIMULATING FOOD. 

There is another classification of food wliich it is well to con- 
sider briefly. In its effect upon the system food is nourishing 
and stimulating, or the reverse. 

Nourishing footU are those which serve to develop perfectly 
every animal function, but do not increase the strength and 
speed of organic action beyond the point of full nutrition. 
Bread, vegetables, fruits, sugar, salt, and water are nourishing 
foods. 

Nourisldng and Stimulating Food. — All food that nourishes 
the body is in one sense stimulating, as it gives renewed energy 
to the bodily functions. But there are foods which impart a 
speed and energy to the organs above that necessary to per- 
fect nutrition; these are termed stimulating foods. Animal 
food is of this class. 

Stimulants. — Alcoholic drinks and condiments are classed as 
stimulants, because they impart no nourislnnent, but act simply 
as excitants to preternatural activity. 

Innutritions foods are those which are not assimilated ; which 
are by nature indigestible, or have been made so by improper 
combinations and modes of cooking. The bran of wheat, fried 
or greasy food, heavy bread, and rich soggy pastry are either 
entirely unassimilated, and therefore not nourishing, or they 
weaken the system by exciting particular organs to excessive 
action 



Digestion, 47 1 



DIGESTION. 

In studying digestion, it is well to keep in mind the twofold 
division of food into nitrogenous, or flesh-forming, and carbona- 
ceous, or heat-producing, elements. The process of digestion 
differs with the character of the food. The purpose of diges- 
tion is to change and combine all the elements of food into a 
fluid which will mingle with the blood, become assimilated, and 
furnish nutriment for the body. 

Digestion is not confined to the stomach. It begins with ui- 
salivation in the mouth, and, after deglutition, is carried on in the 
stomach and intestines, the process continuing through the entire 
length of the alimentary canal, — a tube varying in diameter, 
and thirty-six feet in length. 

The first process in digestion, as in any chemical analysis, is 
to crush the materials. The teeth are the grinders for reducing 
the food. If we bolt our food or swallow it in lumps, the soft 
coats of the stomach are made to do the tearing and grinding 
work of the teeth. A solvent being necessary, the saliva is 
secreted from the blood, and is poured through three pairs of 
glands into the mouth, each pair supplying a different saliva. 
This softens the starch and tender cellulose. Animals, like the 
beaver, which feed chiefly on woody matters, have very large 
salivary glands. 

In health the saliva is always alkaline, especially during and 
after meals. It lubricates the mouth, and moistens the food so 
that it may assume a pasty condition. It is also necessary to 
the sense of taste, everything being tasteless that the saliva can- 
not dissolve. For this reason we cook and season our food so 
that it will excite the flow of the saliva. 

" This saliva is poured into the mouth not to he cast out, but to 
do a specific work, then pass into the stomach and be again ab- 
sorbed. If the system be drained of the saliva by profuse spit- 
ting, as is the case with those who use tobacco freely, the order 
of bodily functions is reversed, and the mouth is made to do the 
work of the kidneys, which is to carry away a large amount of 
the superfluous water and all the waste salts." 



472 The Boston Cook Book. 

The saliva consists mostly of water, with a very small amount of 
saline matter and about five parts in one thousand of ptyalin, an 
albuminous ingredient, or ferment, which has the power of con- 
verting the starchy portions of food into sugar, and sugar into 
lactic acid, but does not act upon nitrogenous food. The saliva 
froths easily, and aids in carrying air into the stomach. 

This is the first step in digestion, and the most important, as 
any error in the beginning leads to evil consequences which affect 
the whole process. It is also important, because it is wholly a 
voluntary process. While the food is in the mouth, we may 
masticate it thoroughly or imperfectly, and swallow or reject 
it. But when deglutition has carried it into the stomach, it is 
wholly beyond our control, and we are not responsible for the 
remainder of the process, only so far as it may be affected by 
error in the first stages. Bread, potatoes, and all starchy foods 
should be thoroughly masticated, and mingled with the saliva. 
Meat may be swallowed hastily, or knives may be made to do 
the work of the teeth in masticating animal food; but no chemist 
can prepare an artificial saliva to be mixed with starchy food, to 
save the trouble of chewing it. If a piece of dry light bread be 
masticated thoroughly, it will crumble and be quickly mixed 
with the saliva, and become sweeter the longer it is kept in the 
mouth. The alkaline saliva changes the starch into sugar, and 
begins the digestion. Try to chew a piece of hot bread and it 
at once assumes a pasty condition, which neither teeth nor saliva 
can penetrate, and is swallowed involuntarily. A piece of putty 
would not be more indigestible. If this experiment be tried, 
no other argument would be needed against the use of hot 
bread. 

The stomach carries on the second part of digestion. The 
presence of food excites the flow of a fluid called the gastric Juice, 
which is secreted in large quantities in the mucous mem- 
brane of the stomach. At the same time the muscular coats 
of the stomach contract, and produce a sort of churning motion, 
which carries the food round and round and over and over, ex- 
posing all parts of it to the action of the fluid. This gastric 
juice is always decidedly ac2c? in its nature, containing hydro- 
chloric acid. The lactic acid formed from the sugar in the 
mouth is also present in the stomach. Tliis acid arrests the 
work begun in the mouth on the starchy foods, renders the alkali 
neutral, and acts only on albuminous food. It contains an 
albuminous ingredient, or ferment, called pepsin, in about the 
same proportion as the ptyalin of the saliva. The pepsin 



Digestion. 473 



mixed with the lactic acid is powerful enough to dissolve all 
the albumen and fibrine of flesh food into albuminose, and sets 
free the starch, sugar, and fat, melts the fat, but does not 
change either. When there is an excess or deficiency of acid 
in the stomach, the digestion is abnormal. Pepsin is sometimes 
used as a remedy for dyspepsia, and is obtained from the 
stomachs of young, healthy pigs which are kept hungry. 

As all food which is to nourish the system must be converted 
into a fluid form, any substances which are taken in fluid 
form and afterward solidified in the stomach, as blood or juice 
of flesh, milk, and raw eggs, must be changed again to a per- 
manent liquid form before they can be absorbed. All nitro- 
genous matters are not only dissolved by the gastric fluid, but 
are modified so as to remain dissolved. These changed albu- 
minous matters are called peptones. Oil plays an important 
part in these changes, so that, although oil is not digested, it 
serves a useful purpose in passing through the stomach. 

The stomach would digest itself were it not protected by a 
sheathing of mucus and by a continual forming of cells called 
epithelium, during the process of digestion. The liquid or wateiy 
portions of food enter at once into the circulation by absorption. 
If too much water be taken with food, it dilutes the gastric 
juice and retards the digestion ; as all that is not needed must 
be absorbed before digestion can go on. 

Digestion is also retarded by the presence of very hot or very 
cold food, as everything taken into the «tomach has to be 
changed to the normal temperature of 100' . A large amount of 
food overloads the stomach, distends the muscular coats, and 
lessens the power of motion. Too little food is also a mistake, 
as the stomach needs a certain amount of bulk to work upon. 
Continual or irregular eating is wholly contrary to the intention 
of nature, since it does not alio./ the stomach time to rest and 
to form new cells to secrete digestive fluids. Flesh food that 
is finely minced, like hash, croquettes, and many entrees, passes 
rapidly through the stomach without being dissolved by the 
gastric juice; but when taken in larger pieces it remains long 
enough to be all digested. 

The digestive power of the stomach is weakened when there 
is any undue action in any other part of the body, as in great 
muscular exertion or in powerful excitement of the brain. 
Therefore we should eat sparingly at first, when fatigued by 
exercise or study or when unduly excited, and should rest 
awhile after eating. 



474 The Boston Cook Book, 



Lactic acid, small portions of sugar and digested nitrogenous 
substances, pass into the blood by absorption through the 
stomach veins. Thus the contents of the stomach leave it in 
two directions : a portion is absorbed through the coats of the 
stomach by the process of osmose, or the passage of fluids 
through animal membranes; the remainder passes through the 
pyloric opening into the duodenum and intestines for the com- 
pletion of digestion. Food from the stomach enters the duode- 
num in an acid state, and in the intestines is mingled with 
three alkaline fluids, all containing soda. 

The pancreatic fluid, secreted from the pancreas, digests the 
fatty matters. It breaks the large granules of oil and fat into a 
great many minute particles, and converts them into a milky 
liquid called chyle, which mixes freely with water and passes 
through the tissues of the intestines into the lacteals. It also 
changes the starch into sugar, and the sugar into lactic acid, but 
has very little action on albuminous substances. 

The bile, secreted from the liver, plays an important part in 
intestinal digestion, the exact nature of which is unknown. 
Bile is a complex liquid, consisting of biliary acid in combina- 
tion with soda. It certainly aids in the absorption of fat, and 
many suppose its purpose is to lubricate the walls of the intes- 
tinal canal; from its soapy consistency it effects a smooth, non- 
irritating passage of the contents. If there be any lack or 
surplus of the bile, it soon produces an injurious result in the 
system. The bile is in the intestines, and not in the stomach 
except when the act." on of the stomach is inverted, in nausea 
and vomiting; then the bile is forced up into the stomach in- 
stead of down into the intestines. 

The intestinal juice, secreted in the mucous membrane the 
entire length of the intestine, combines the active and digestive 
powers of all the other secretions. 

The lactic acid is formed so rapidly from the digestion of 
sugar that the contents of the intestine quickly becomes acidu- 
lous, and this completes the digestion of any portions of nitro- 
genous food not fully digested in the stomach. The combined 
amount of the salivary, gastric, pancreatic, biliary, and intes- 
tinal fluids secreted daily is twenty-one pints, of which the 
gastric juice forms more than one half. There are mechanical 
aids to intestinal as well as stomach digestion. The writhing, 
worm-like motion, or peristaltic movement, of the muscular coats 
of the intestines forces the food downward, and exposes all 
portions of it to the digestive fluids. 



Absorption. 475 



Notwithstanding all these powerful agents in digestion, a 
portion of useful matter passes through the intestines un- 
changed; and if there be a deficiency of either fluid, or a 
weakness of the muscular coats, or too great a quantity of irri- 
tating substance, like cellulose, woody fibre, bran, etc., the 
amount is increased. This is carried, with the innutritions 
portion, into the larger intestine, and forms a part of the 
excretions. 



ABSORPTION. 

The nutritive and perfectly digested portions of food are 
absorbed partly by the veins of the stomach, entering at once 
into the circulation, and partly by the intestines. The lining 
membrane of the intestines folds over and over upon itself, like 
a ruffle, along the entire edge; this is full of little tubes, or viUi, 
which absorb the chyle. 

The blood vessels absorb the nutritive elements from the villi 
and carry them to the veins in two ways: 1st. Through the 
portal vein into the liver, where it penetrates every part of the 
liver, then passes out through the hepatic vein into the veins 
near the heart; 2d. Through the lacteals, which are attached to 
the lining membrane of the intestines and empty into the 
thoracic duct, a tube extending along the spine, and then into 
the subclavian vein, which lies in the left side of the neck, 
under the collar bone. The veins also bring with them the 
lymph, — a thin colorless fluid which comes from the absorbent 
vessels situated all over the body, and which contains the 
worn-out particles. 

Then the venous blood, supplied from the lacteals with new 
material, and from the lymphatic vessels with waste materials, 
enters the heart through the upper door, or right auricle, passes 
through the valves down into the right ventricle ; out through 
the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where, as purple venous 
blood, it penetrates to the most remote capillaries. 

If the lungs be full of pure fresh air, the oxygen changes the 
purple blood into red blood, and burns up the impurities. The 
waste products of the combustion of carbon and hydrogen are 
expelled from the lungs at every breath in the form of carbonic 
acid and watery vapor; and not until now can the new elements 
in the blood, obtained from the food, become in reality food, or 
perfect blood. 



A7^ The Boston Cook Book 

This oxygenized or vitalized blood now returns from the lungs, 
and enters the heart through the left upper door, or left auricle; 
the valves open and allow it to pass into the left ventricle, 
then out through the aorta, or great artery, from which the 
arteries carry it to the capillaries all over the system. 

In the capillaries the new material is deposited wherever 
needed, and changed by cell growth into new tissue. The 
lymphatic vessels take up all that is not needed, with the 
worn-out portions ; and the veins then carry this impure blood 
back again to the lungs and heart. 

Thus a continuous circulation is established, the blood coursing 
over the whole body once in every three to five minutes, the time 
varying with the amount of exercise and the state of health. 
During this circulation the combustible compounds are burned 
by the oxygen received into the blood in the lungs, the carbona- 
ceous products of combustion are expelled through the lungs as 
carbonic acid gas and watery vapor, and the nitrogenous pro- 
ducts through the kidneys in the form of urates. 

" This process of digestion and absorption is really a kind of 
preliminary cooking process, going on from the mouth downwards 
all the way to the colon ; and from every part of the long canal 
tiny lacteals and absorbing veinlets carry off contributions of 
food either to the general store of chyle, or to the venous blood 
which is hurrying back to the heart." 



NUTRITION". 

" Albumen is the basis of all animal nutrition. This is seen 
in the bird's egg during incubation. Under the influence of 
warmth and oxygen, all the tissues, membranes, and bones are 
developed from albumen." 

In the human body a nutritious fluid is prepared from the 
food, and supplies materials for growth and repair. This fluid 
is the blood, and when examined under the microscope is found 
to consist of a clear colorless fluid, of a saline, alkaline, and 
albuminous nature, and an immense number of infinitely minute 
blood globules, or corpuscles. These corpuscles consist of an 
albuminous membrane called globulin, filled with a red coloring 
matter, hematine, in which there is much iron. 

This liquid albuminous portion of the blood must be changed 
to fibrine before it can nourish the muscles of the body. The 



Mitrition. » 477 



change of the gluten, caseine, and all the varieties of albuminous 
food into fibrine is a gradual process, begun in the lacteals, con- 
tinued in the circulation of the blood, and completed in the lungs 
by the oxygen which they receive in breathing. This fibrine 
remains in the liquid state, owing to the alkaline nature of the 
blood, and is distributed by the circulation into all parts of the 
structure, where it gradually coagulates into a network of tough 
thread-like fibres, enclosing in its meshes the blood corpuscles, 
and is changed by cell growth into new tissue, solid flesh and 
bone. 

The nervous system is also built and repaired from albumen. 
Nervous matter is about seven per cent albumen, and is the 
material by which we are put into relation with the external 
world. By it we see, hear, feel, taste, smell, and are conscious 
of existence. 

Each elementary cell or particle of tissue, whether of bone, 
flesh, or nerves, seems to have a sort of gland-like power, not 
only of attracting materials from the blood, but of causing them 
to assume its structure and participate in its properties. The 
bones and teeth select and appropriate the phosphates of lime, 
and magnesia, also fluorine. The muscles and nerves take 
fibrine, phosphates of magnesia, and potash. The cartilages 
seek for soda; the hair, skin, and nails are made up of silica. 
Iron is needed in the coloring matter of the blood, the black 
pigment of the eye, and in the hair. Sulphur exists in the hair, 
and phosphorus in the brains. The glands of the mouth take 
the substances necessary to form saliva; those of the eye, the 
elements of tears; the coats of the stomach, gastric juice; and 
the liver, bile. Each part of the body has the power to select, 
from the common supply, the material which suits it best for 
building and growing. 

If the conversion of albumen into fibrine be incomplete, the 
tissues are imperfectly nourished. The formation of tubercles 
in the lungs is caused by half-formed cells and coagulated albu- 
men deposited in the lungs. This is caused by a deficiency of 
the oily matter, which is necessary for the perfect formation of 
cells and the growth of healthy tissue. Hence for these cases 
physicians prescribe cod-liver oil. 

iDistilled spirits coagulate the albumen which ought to go 
into the blood; this prevents the proper digestion of food, and 
causes one of the great evils resulting from their use. The cer- 
vous tissue is thus deprived of nourishment, which is one of the 
causes of delirium tremens. 



478 The Boston Cook Booh 

Every twinge of pain in neuralgia is the nerves crying out 
for better blood. Imperfect digestion and assimilation of food 
are the chief causes of neuralgia. 

Nutrition, though seemingly complex, is really a simple pro- 
cess; albumen is changed to fibrine, and fibrine to flesh. The 
relation of each to the other has been aptly compared to that of 
the raw cotton, the spun yarn, and the woven fabric. 

The minute corpuscles in the blood are constantly building up 
the body, very much as the coral insect builds its structure. The 
work of each corpuscle is too small for our conception ; but, taken 
in the aggregate, the result is the wonderful growth and renova- 
tion of the human body. And what is still more wonderful, 
every organ of the body is on the alert to keep the whole system 
in natural health. The activity of the vessels which remove 
the waste particles from the blood is untiring. The kidneys 
are the scavengers of the body, and stand next to the lungs in 
renovating it. If too much water be drunk, the kidneys, lungs, 
and skin carry it off, for fear that the blood should become too 
watery. We may cease to convey food into the body for days 
with no evil consequences; but let the removing organs cease 
operations for a single day, and disease ensues. 



LIFE AND MOTION.i 

Circulation of Water. — As a plant grows, water from the soil 
or air unites chemically with carbon, and forms the woody fibre 
of the stem, the sugar of the sap, and the starch of the seed. 
When the plant dies, the water is again set free from its struc- 
ture and passes into the air. The starch and sugar, also, which 
the plant yields having been consumed by some animal, the 
water which they contain passes into the air through the lungs 
and skin. Thus the same water is caused to revolve in a circle 
of life-sustaining combinations. Within a single hour it may 
be in some vegetable structure in the form of sugar; then it 
may pass into and circulate through some animal system and 
be discharged as vapor from the lungs, and afterwards become

of Matter," contsiined in "Johnston's Chemistry of Common Life." It is

absorbed by thirsty leaves and aid in the growth of flowers and 
fruits. 

Circulation of Carhon. — Vegetables, which are largely starch 
and carbon, absorb carbonic-acid gas from the atmosphere, which 
contains thirty-three grains of carbon in every square inch. If 
the world were all dry land, and covered with dense vegetation, 
all the carbon would be extracted from the atmosphere in twenty- 
three years. This carbonic acid is restored to the atmosphere by 
the waste and decay of vegetable matter, by the exhalations from 
animals, and by combustion. 

The leaf of a living plant draws in carbonic acid gas from the 
air, and gives off the oxygen contained in it, retaining only the 
carbon. The roots drink in moisture from the soil ; and out of 
the carbon and water contained in it the plant forms starch, 
sugar, fat, and other substances. 

The animal takes the starch, sugar, or fat into its stomach, 
and draws in oxygen through its lungs. New chemical combina- 
tions are thus formed, undoing the work of the plant, and send- 
ing back to the air, from the lungs and skin, both the starch and 
oxygen, in the form of carbonic-acid gas and water. The same 
material is constantly circulating, — now floating in invisible air, 
now forming the substance of the growing plant, now of the 
moving animal, and now diffusing itself through the air ready 
to go its round again. It forms part of a vegetable to-day; to- 
morrow it is in a man's backbone; a week hence it may have 
passed through another plant and into another animal. 

In burning coal, we cause its carbon to unite with the oxygen 
of the air and to disappear as carbonic acid gas. The carbon 
returns to the atmosphere from which it may have been taken 
millions of years ago when it was appropriated by the gi'owing 
plants, which, in the form of vegetable matter, were afterwards 
buried beneath the surface of the earth only to reappear ages 
subsequently in the form of fuel. The earth itself breathes 
out carbonic acid, sometimes with water, sometimes alone. It 
sparkles in the springs of Carlsbad and Seltzer; it kills man and 
beast in the terrible " Valley of Death " in the island of Java. 

In this way is supplied the loss of that which is daily buried 
by the shell fish and coral insects in the limestone formations 
and coral growths. These rocks contain, chained down in seem- 
ingly everlasting imprisonment, two fifths of their weight of 
carbonic acid. 

Circulation of Nitrogen. — Gluten and fibrine are distinguished 
from starch and fat by containing nitrogen. The nitrogen forms 



480 The Boston Cook Booh. 

four fifths of the air. It exists also in ammonia, and in aqua 
fortis, or nitric acid. These two compound bodies exist and are 
found in the soil; and from the soil the nitrogen is taken up by 
the plants, and gluten is formed. When the animal consumes 
the gluten, it builds up and renews the waste of its several parts. 
The gluten of the plant is transformed into the flesh and tissues 
of the living animal. Thus the nitrogen of the soil through 
the plant has reached the dignity of being a part of breathing, 
intellectual man. 

Having reached this form, this restless element, nitrogen, 
grows weary of inactivity and moves on. Not only the living 
body as a whole is in constant motion, but even its minutest 
parts are continually active. " They are like the population of 
a great city moving to and fro, coming and going continually, 
weeded out and removed every hour by deaths and departures, 
yet as unceasingly kept up in numbers by new in-comers, chang- 
ing from day to day so insensibly as to escape observation, yet 
so evidently that after a few years scarcely a known face can 
be discovered among the congregated thousands." Scarcely has 
the gluten of the plant been fitted comfortably to its place in the 
muscle, the skin, or the hair of the animal, when it begins to be 
dissolved again and is removed. 

The living animal absorbs much oxygen from the air by its 
lungs. One part of it converts the carbon of the food into car- 
bonic acid; another portion is built into the substance of the 
body; a large part is employed in dissolving and removing the 
waste in urea, uric acid, etc. This urea and uric acid return to 
the soil from which the nitrogen they contain originally came, 
and where they are reconverted into ammonia, nitric acid, and 
other substances, and are now ready to enter into new roots and 
go the rounds again. 

The undigested gluten is rejected in the animal droppings, 
mingles with the soil, and is changed to ammonia and nitric 
acid. The vegetables which die undergo natural decay, and 
again enter the soil and air as elements. Animal bodies them- 
selves die at last, and the nitrogen tliey contain is made to assume 
the forms in which plants are able to take it up. The ammonia 
and volatile compounds of nitrogen, produced by animal and 
vegetable decay, rise in the form of gas or vapor, and escape 
into the air. The rains of heaven wash the ammonia out and 
bring it back to the earth. Part of it is, however, resolved into 
elementai-y nitrogen, and is thus lost to plants. To make up 
for this loss, nitric acid is formed in the air in small quantities. 



Circulation of Matter. 481 

Througli the agency of the electric currents the oxygen and 
nitrogen of the air unite to form nitric acid. Ammonia is given 
off by volcanoes, and is returned to the earth by the rains and 
snows. 

Circulation of Mineral Matter. — Everything which the animal 
body contains is derived, directly or indirectly, from vegetable 
foods; and the mineral or ash it leaves, Avhen burned, must have 
come from the soil through the plant. When the animal dies, 
its body sooner or later returns to the soil. So we have another 
circle in which the earthy matter of animals and plants moves- 
It ascends from the soil to the plant, then to the animal, and 
back again to mother earth, so that it is really " dust to dust." 

The plant does not absorb all mineral matters, but selects the 
rarer and more precious materials from the soil, and such as are 
held in solution by water. Phosphoric acid, lime, magnesia, and 
saline matter, of which common salt is a representative, are the 
principal substances chosen. The animal eating the vegetable, 
these substances enter its stomach, and are dissolved and enter 
the blood. The vessels provided for the purpose select the re- 
quired material, and, like ships in commerce, sail away on the 
blood rivers to their destined havens. The saline portion is car- 
ried to the blood and tissues. The phosphate of lime goes to the 
bones, and phosphate of potash to the muscles. After a time 
the animal, partly as it wastes and finally when it dies, returns 
to the soil all that the plant took from it. New plants receive 
it, and it goes the rounds again. 

So, over and over again, as the modeller fashions his clay, plant 
and animal are formed out of the same material. Is, all sense- 
less matter to be constantly working, and are we intetligent 
beings to idle away a precious but limited existence ? One 
should learn from this always to work for a definite purpose. 

How lovely is the plant in its position of bond-servant of man ! 
How willing and interesting! It serves till death, yet rises again 
rejoicing as ever, when spring returns, to renew its destined 
toil. 

The least alteration in the natural constitution of things would 
insure the extinction of animal and vegetable life.

RECAPITULATION. 



The Plant takes in, water, 
by its roots ; carbonic acid, by 
its leaves; nitrogen, in the form 
of ammonia and nitric acid; 
minerals, in the form of phos- 
phoric acid, lime, common and 
other salts, from the soil. 

The Animal takes in, water, 
starch, fat, gluten, and mineral 
matters, in the form of vege- 
table and animal food, into its 
stomach; and oxygen into its 
lungs. 



The Plant produces, oxygen^ 
from its leaves ; sugar, starch, 
gluten, and mineral matters, in 
its sap and solid substances. 



The Animal produces, car^ 
bonic acid and water, which are 
exhaled from the skin and 
lungs ; urea, phosphates, and 
other salts, in the excretions; 
the fat in the body, which is 
in time breathed away in the

and perfect muscle, bone, blood, 
and tissues, to build and repair 
the body. 

The Soil produces, carbon in 
the form of wood and coal, and 
in spring water; ammonia, ni- 
tric acid, and other nitrogenous 
compounds ; phosphoric acid, 
lime, common salt, and other 
mineral matters. 



So the movement is circular; the beginning is the end. A 
marvellous commerce appears ; soil, plant, and animal commin- 
gling ; the elements of each being at different times the elements 
of all, and their interchange perpetual. 



Chocolate Reception. 483 



ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 



Reception 2 qts. milk. 
Chocolate. 1 lb. cocoa powder. 

3 rounded tbsp. white 
susrar. 



1 pt. cream. 

2 eggs. 

3 tsp. vanilla extract. 



Bring milk to boil, work the cocoa in a little of the 
cold milk, then stir into the boiling milk till smooth. 
Boil ten minutes, add the sugar and cream, and stir well 
while boiling. Turn into a double boiler and keep the 
water in lower boiler almost at boiling point for half an 
hour. Then beat the eggs very light, add them and re- 
move immediately from the fire. When cool add the 
flavoring. 

This can be made in the morning, and when ready to 
serve, put from one to two tablespoonfuls of the prepara- 
tion into the cup and fill with boiling water. 

By cooking the cocoa we have a much more delicious 
flavor than that obtained by pouring boiling water directly 
upon the raw cocoa in the cup. The eggs and cream 
give body and richness. It will serve from sixty to 
eighty people. 

Church Sociable Coffee. — Tf we follow the proportion 
of one rounded tablespoon or one-half ounce of coffee^ 
ground, for each half-pint cup water, we must allow one 
pound of coffee for eight quarts of water. This will 
make coffee of medium strength and will be suflScient for 
about thirty persons. 

Soak the coffee one hour in two quarts of cold water 
in a tightly covered jar and then turn it into a cloth bag. 
Have the requisite amount of water in a large boiler with 
a tight cover, and when just ready to boil, put in the bag 
of coffee and the water in which it soaked, and let it boil 
ten minutes. 



484 The Boston Cooh Book. 

Handy Coffee. — Put six rounded tablespoonfuls of 
coffee in a hot coffee-pot or biggin, pour through it one 
quart boiling ivater. When all dripped through, pour the 
liquid through the grounds again, and after this second 
filtering let it come to the boiling point and then bottle 
tightly. When coffee is wanted, scald three- fourths cup of 
milk., heat two toblespoons of the bottled coffee and pour 
the two over the sugar in a hot cup. 

Quick Rolls. — Dissolve three yeast cakes in one cup of 
ivater., add one jnnt of milk scalded and cooled, one tea- 
spoonful of salt^ one table spoonful of butter, and two 
teaspoonfuls of sugar. Stir in flour enough to make 
a stiff dough, then knead it half an hour, being careful 
not to get it too stiff. Then without waiting for it to 
rise, divide it into equal portions for small rolls, and 
shape into balls and then into finger rolls, or press 
a small knife handle or roller through the middle, mak- 
ing cleft rolls, or it may be rolled with the hands into 
four long rolls. Put the rolls in a greased pan, cover 
with a cloth, let them rise about forty-five minutes. Then 
bake in a quick oven from twenty to forty minutes ac- 
cording to the size. Do not stop kneading until the time 
is up, or let the dough stand before shaping. If the 
dough is disturbed after it begins to rise, it will be diffi- 
cult to avoid having very large air holes. The idea is 
to make the dough light quickly by the large amount of 
yeast, rather than to exhaust the strength and elasticity 
of the flour by slow rising. Thus in less than two hours 
you will have bread or rolls that will surprise you by 
their lightness, fine texture, and rich nutty flavor. Not 
a trace of the yeast in the bread ; light, and yet unlike 
the extreme lightness of the usual yeast rolls, a rich 
crust that looks hard but proves to be soft and tender, 
and with none of the dry, chippy flavor common to bread 
raised over night.

Zwieback, No. 1. — Scald one cup mUk, add half a tea- 
spoon salt, and when cool dissolve in it half a cake of 
compressed yeast. Stir in flour to make a batter that 
just drops from the spoon. Let the bowl stand in a 
pan of warm (not hot) water, and when the sponge is 
full of bubbles add the following mixture : Two rounded 
tablespoons butter creamed with quarter cup sugar, and 
two ivell beaten eggs. 

Add more flour, and when stiff knead it until smooth 
and light. Let it rise until double its bulk, then shape 
it into finger rolls and place them close together in a 
shallow pan. Let them rise again until very light ; then 
bake in a hot oven about half an hour. The next day, 
or when thoroughly cold, cut the loaf in half-inch slices 
and let them stand in a very slow oven until colored and 
dry all through. 

Zwieback, No. 2. — Scald one cup milk; when luke- 
warm, dissolve in it ttvo yeast cakes, half a teaspoon 
salt, and four enough to make a soft dough. Let it 
rise until light, then stir in quarter cup melted butter, 
quarter cup sugar, and two eggs unbeaten. Mix thoroughly 
and add enough more flour to shape it into a loaf. Let 
it rise in the pan until very light ; then bake in a quick 
oven, and when nearly done brush over with sugar dis- 
solved in milk. When cold cut in half-inch thick slices 
and let them color and dry in a moderate oven.

% a nutmeg. 

2 eggs. 



Make a sponge of the milk warmed, the yeast and salt. 
When very light, add the butter and sugar creamed to- 
gether with the thoroughly beaten eggs, also the nutmeg 
and sufficient bread flour to make a dough that will 
mould without added flour, but not too stiff. Mould one- 
half hour on a warm board, then roll out one-half inch 
thick, cut with a small biscuit cutter and arrange half an 
inch apart on the warm board and place near the range 
till light. Then fry slowly, roll in powdered sugar while 
hot if you prefer. This makes three dozen. 

If a plainer rule is desired, omit one egg and use one- 
third cup of butter, the remainder of the rule the same as 
above. Be careful that at any time before frying they 
do not get too warm. 

Doughnuts. — Rub a teaspoon of butter into a generous 
cup of sugar ^ add ttuo unbeaten eggs and stir thoroughly ; 
add one scant cup of milk. Mix four level teaspoons of 
baking powder in two cups of sifted flour, and stir into 
the mixture. Then add more flour till soft as can be 
rolled out, one-third inch thick. Cut in rings and fry in 
clean hot fat. Test the fat by dropping in a piece of the 
dough, which should rise at once to the top with a good 
deal of ebullition and begin to brown at once. Turn only 
once. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — Mix over night, tivo cups buck-

Stir in warm water for thick batter, tico tablespoons 
molasses, and ojie-half cake compressed yeast dissolved

thin with warm water, or if any sour odor, add onefourth 
teaspoon soda dissolved in ivater. Rise again and fry on 
greased griddle as wanted. 



Oyster Cocktails. 



487 



Hors-d'oeuvre, (ili. L. Clarke.) — Remove the crust from 
a loaf of rye bread, cut into slices nearly two inches 
thick, remove crusts and hollow out the centre sufficiently 
to enable a lemon to stand upright in it. Cut the ends 
of the bread block into thin slices, not quite to the 
bottom. Cut a lemon in halves and scoop out the pulp 
from the sections, being careful to leave the membranous 
wall of every other section so there will be five distinct 
places in the cup thus formed. In these cavities put 
minced olives, 2')icMes, the bits of lemon, pounded sar- 
dines, caviare, finelj'' minced ham, tongue, ancJiouies, 
capers, or any other relish or combination you prefer. 
Have at least three varieties. Put the filled half lemon 
in the hollow of the bread. Put a dainty doil}'^ or paper 
on the plate, the bread on that, and an oyster fork across 
the plate. They may be placed beside the guest's plate 
and the various relishes nibbled as one fancies. The 
bread is broken from the cut end as needed. 

Oyster Cocktail. — Use very small oysters, and allow 
from four to eight for each glass. Keep them on ice 
until wanted, and have the glasses thoroughly chilled 
before filling. Use the common claret glass if you have 
not the regular cocktail glass. When ready to serve, 
put the oysters in the glass and add either of the follow- 
ing mixtures, using from one to two teaspoonfuls accord- 
ing: to taste.

Clam Cocktail. (i«« Rand.) — For ever}^ cocktail re- 
quired, take one teaspooiiful of lemon juice, oneteaspoonful 
of vinegar, a quarter of a teaspoonful of walnut sauce, 
one-half teaspoonful of mushroom catsup, one-half tea- 
spoonful of grated horseradish, one-half teaspoonful of 
tomato catsup, a pinch of salt, a dash of tabasco sauce ; 
pour this mixture over eight little neck clams and serve 
in an ice cup, or in a glass which was set on ice for hours 
previous to serving. This cocktail finds great favor for 
luncheon, high teas, or suppers. 

Caviare. — This is the roe of the sturgeon preserved in 
salt alone or in salt, pepper, and onions and left to fer- 
ment. The best caviare comes from the north of Europe ; 
that made on the Volga, called caviare of Astraehan is 
preferred by some. It is regarded as a heavy food, diffi- 
cult of digestion. The flavor is exceedingly disagreeable 
to an unaccustomed palate, and this has led to the expres- 
sion, " Caviare to the general," for anything that cannot 
be appreciated or understood by the people. Caviare is 
highly esteemed by the Russians, and the most delicate 
species of the sturgeon are reserved for the royal family. 
It is classed among the hors-d'oeuvres, or savouries, and 
is usually served on or with fried toast or crofitons, or 
brown bread, after the soup or fish. It should not be 
long exposed to the air. If you buy it in the little barrels, 
divide it into small bottles and cork them tightly, then 
open only as wanted. If it should become too hard, 
break it up and work in a little olive oil and lemon juice. 
This is often the only preparation given it at gentlemen's 
suppers, where a skilful host, if he prefers, can prepare 
it for each guest. Sometimes it is served on a side dish 
with slices of lemon around it, and sometimes with finely 
chopped scallions or other raw onions. 



Cavaire, 489 



Caviare Canapes, No. 1. — Cut slices of bread quarter 
of an inch thick, then cut out with a two-inch cutter into 
rounds. Saute or fry in hot butter on each side without 
burning, and set away to cool. Cream quarter of a cup 
of fresh butter, add salt and paprika to taste, and mix 
with it as much finely minced icater-cress as will give it 
a fine flavor. Chop the cress very fine, then squeeze dry 
in a napkin and chop again until very fine and dry. 
Make the butter into balls, and let it become hard. 
When ready to serve, spread the croutons with the butter, 
then spread a layer of caviare on top, and squeeze a little 
lemon juice over, and serve. 

Caviare, No. 2. — Cut slices of bread one inch thick, 
then with a pattie cutter stamp them out into rounds. 
With a smaller cutter stamp the centre two-thirds of the 
way down. Fry them in hot deep fat until a delicate 
brown color, drain, and with a sharp knife remove the 
centre crust. Then fill the centres with a mixture made 
in the following proportions. Tico tablespoonfuls of 
caviare, one teasp)oonful beef extract, one teaspoonful 
lemon juice, a scdtspooiful curry powder, and also of 
2Ktprika. Put all into a sauce pan and stir over the fire 
until quite hot, then put it into the croutons. This may 
be served hot or cold, one to each person on a plate with 
a paper doily. 

Caviare, No. 3. — Prepare some croutons from cjuarter- 
inch slices of bread, about three and a half inches long 
and one and a hcdf inches wide, fry, cool, and spread 
with the caviare. Pound together the yolks of two hard 
boiled eggs, six boned anchovies, a teaspoonful of chopped 
capers, a s(dtspoonful each of mustard and paprika, and 
tiuo tablespoonfuls butter. Mix and pound until very 
fine, then press it through a puree strainer, and put it 
into a bag with a small frosting tube, and use as you 
would frosting. Use a paper cornucopia if you have no 
bag or tube. Chop some parsley or water-cress very fine 



490 The Boston Cook Book. 

and put it on the corners of the crouton. Cut some hard 
boiled eggs into halves, lengthwise, and place them in 
the centre of the crotltons, then with the tube fill the egg 
cavities with the puree. 

Or, the egg whites may be sifted, and then the crolitons 
decorated according to your taste, with fancy lines of the 
puree, the white and the green salad. 

Cheese Canapes. — Allow the beaten ivhite of 07ie egg 
to each cuj) of finely crumbled or grated cheese, a sj^eck 
of salt and cayenne. Remove the crust from inch-thick 
slices of bread, hollow out centre making a box, fill with 
the cheese mixture heaped, bake about ten minutes, and 
serve on napkin. 

Thin Brown bread and Butter. — Trim off the crusts 
from a loaf of brown bread, leaving it in rectangular 
shape. Slice it very thin and spread with a thin coating 
of butter. Put two slices together and cut each square 
into triangles. Arrange them neatly on a plate and 
serve them with raw oysters. 

Halibut a La Conant. — In a baking pan put three 
thin slices of fat scdt pork about two inches square, 
three slices of onion and a bit of bay leaf. On top of 
these lay a two-jyound slice of halibut, spread over it one 
tables2)007ful butter and one tahlespoonful flour creamed 
together. Cover with buttered cracker cr^imbs and small 
strips of scdt po k and bake twenty minutes. Take out 
the fish with a fish spade or two long knives, and lay it on 
a hot platter. Garnish with lemon and j^arsley. Cooked 
in this way the halibut is delicious, moist inside with a 
crisp brown crust, and so nicely flavored that no sauce 
is required. 

Broiled Shad. — Split the shad dow^n the back, lay it 
open, clean, remove the back bone and as many of the 
fine bones as possible, and wipe dry. Brush all over 
with oil or melted butter. Lay it on a greased broiler 



Fish. 491 

and cook over coals or under gas, flesh side first, until 
brown, then turn and cook the skin side until crisp. 
Meanwliile have prepared one large tablespoonful huttev 
creamed with one level teaspoonful salt^ one saltspoo7iful 
pepper or paprika^ one tablespoon lemon juice or ivalnut 
catsup^ and one tablespoon minced parsley, and when the 
fish is on the platter spread this over the surface and make 
several incisions that it may penetrate the fish. Garnish 
with lemon points ?^udi p>arslei/^ and serve very hot. 

Planked Fish. — Shad or bluefish are nice cooked in 
this way ; indeed among camping parties along the shores 
of the Connecticut River planked shad is a favorite dish. 
Clean the fish, remove the head, and split entirely open. 
Nail it to a board, set in front of the fire and broil until 
the fisli is browned and cooked through. Remove it 
from the plank, and spread with butter., salt., and cayenne 
pepper. If dishes are scarce, as they are very likely 
to be in camp, season the fish and serve upon the plank 
as a platter. 

Turbot. — Select a turbot weighing from four to six 
pounds, and with yellowish-white flesh. Wash and soak 
it half an hour in one quart cold icater with two table- 
spoons salt to remove the slime. Put again into fresh 
water, drain and wipe. Remove the skin, cut the fish 
away from the bone and divide through the centre 
lengthwise, making four fillets. Wipe, sprinkle with 
salt and peppf'v^ brush over with oil or melted butter., 
and broil a delicate brown. Season with butter^ salt, 
and pepper, garnish with icater-cress, and serve with 
cucumber sauce. 

Fried Pickerel or Pike. — This fish is especially nice 
for frying, as the flesh may be sliced into uniform pieces 
about one inch thick, giving round, shapely steaks. Of 
course, the fins, scales, and entrails are first removed, 
and the fish washed and wiped dry. Roll the slices 
lightly in Jlour or fine white cornmealj and cook them 



492 The Boston Cook Booh. 

quickly in hot fat, half lard and half butter; or use salt 
pork fat. Do not let the fat burn. Turn the fish when 
brown, and when the other side is cooked, remove them 
to a pan lined with soft paper, to absorb the grease, 
while 3'ou make a cream gravy. Scrape out any burned 
crumbs left in the pan, but if they are only browned they 
will do no harm. If pork has been used, remove the 
scraps and fat. Turn in one-fourth cuj) of hot ivater., 
and scrape off any brown glaze from the pan, then add 
07ie cup of thick cream., and let it boil a few minutes. 
Rub one tablespoon each of butter and Jlour together, 
stir it in, with chopped jjcirsley and salt and pep^per. 
Strain it on to a platter and lay the browned fish in the 
sauce. Serve the crisp pork as a relish for those who 
care for it. If the fish have been frozen, thaw them out 
in cold water. 

Swordfish. — This valuable sea food has many friends 
among those who have eaten it at its best, and especially 
after the excitement of chasing it through the briny 
waves. But tastes differ, and some people dislike it ex- 
ceedingly, and never include it in their summer menus. 
It has quite a strong, distinctive flavor, and in grain and 
texture is not unlike some meats. Some parts of the 
flesh are dark and oily, for it belongs to the red-blooded 
division of the finny tribe, but the lighter-colored por- 
tions, when perfectly fresh, are very rich and delicious. 
It is usually sold in thin steaks or slices after the manner 
of halibut, which it somewhat resembles in size. Sword- 
fish steaks are cut about half an inch thick and are some- 
times broiled over the coals, but more often they are 
parboiled in a hot spider slightly greased. As they are 
rich in fat, they need but little, and will take on a rich 
brown color without the aid of flour or crumbs, and will 
cook through without becoming hard and dry. A little 
salt and pepper., with buffer and lemon juice is all the 
dressing required, but fried or broiled tomatoes are an 
excellent accompaniment. 



Fish. 493 

Stuffed Smelts. — Chop six large oysters^ add one cup 
of soft bread crumbs^ one tablespoonful of melted butter^ 
and salt and pepper to taste. Clean the smelts, fill with 
the mixture, sew the edges, roll in melted butter, then 
in soft bread crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven ten 
minutes. Serve with Maitre d'Hotel butter. Cream two 
tablespoonfids butter^ add juice of half a lemon or lime^ 
and a teaspoonfal of chopped parsley. 

Haddock Rarebit. — Have the haddock cut in slices or 
steaks about one inch thick and free from bone and skin. 
Lay them in a greased baking dish, and season with 
salt and pepper. Turn them over and spread on the 
top of each a cheese mixture prepared as for a rarebit. 
Have the cheese finely crumbled and seasoned with salt^ 
cayenne, and a bit of nmstard, and- if you like you may 
bind the mixture with beaten egg or cream. Put into 
a very hot oven and cook until the cheese melts and 
browns, and the fish is firm. Take up carefully on a 
serving dish and pour over one tablespoon of sherry to 
each slice. 



New 1 cup raw salt fish. 
Fish 1 pint potatoes. 
Balls. 1 teasp. butter. 



^ teasp. pepper. 
Salt if needed. 
Whites of 2 eggs. 



Wash the fish, pick in half-inch pieces, and free from 
bones. Pare the potatoes and cut in quarters, allowing 
a heaping pint measure to a level cup of fish. Put 
potatoes and fish in a stew pan and cover with boiling 
water. Boil twenty-five minutes, or till the potatoes are 
soft, but be careful not to let them boil long enough to 
become soggy. Drain otf all the water ; mash and beat 
the fish and potatoes with a wire beater till very light ; 
add the butter and pepper, and when cooled add the 
stiffly beaten egg whites and more salt if needed. 

While the fish and potatoes are cooking, try out several 
slices of sweet fat salt pork, being very careful that it 
does not burn, and when crisp remove the slices and

keep them warm. Drop a large tablespoonful of the mix- 
ture on a floured board and shape it into a round cake 
about one and one half inches thick, and floured on each 
side. When all are shaped, put them into the hot pork 
fat and brown them delicately on each side, but not on 
the edges. The white mixture should seem to be burst- 
ing out from the browned surfaces. Drain them on 
paper and serve them with hard-boiled eggs cut length- 
wise and laid on each cake. Boil the eggs eight minutes, 
or just enough to set the yolks. Garnish with the crisp 
pork and pickles cut in fancy shapes. 

Or you may omit the boiled egg garnish and make a 
sauce with the two yolks and pour it into the centre of 
the dish and lay the cakes around it. Or put the cakes 
in the centre, the yellow sauce at one end, and some 
sliced green tomato pickle at the other. 

Hulled Corn Soup. — There is a distinctive flavor to 
hulled corn that is especially agreeable to many, particu- 
larly to those who have been accustomed to this dish in 
childhood. But often the corn is not quite tender, or 
one wishes to serve it in a more modern way, and a soup 
or puree will be found to be both novel and delicious. 
If the corn is tender, mash it until fine and sift it 
through a puree strainer; otherwise chop the corn fine 
before sifting. Then gradually stir in hot milk enough 
to make it the consistency of any cream vegetable soup. 
Put it on to boil and add salt and pepper to taste, and 
a generous tahlespoonfid of hutter^ for each quart of the 
mixture. Serve it with croCitons. It will have a slightly 
granular texture, and if this is not liked, j^ou may add 
the usual flour thickening. One tablespoonful of butter 
and one tablespoonful of flour cooked together, and 
stirred into the hot soup. If a corn puree is desired, 
simply mash and sift the corn, heat and season to taste 
with butter., salt., and peppe.r., and serve as a vegetable, 
or as a garnish for sausage or pork chops. 



Noodles. 



495 



Noodles. — Beat two eggs slightly, add two tablespoon- 
fills of milk, and half a teasjyootiful of salt. Stir in flour 
enough to make a very stiff dough. Knead it till stiff as 
possible. Roll it out into rectangular pieces and so thin 
you can see through it. Lay them on a napkin half an 
hour until they are dry, but not brittle. Rub over with 
a little flour so it will not stick. Roll up tight and hard, 
and then slice off from the end about one-eighth of an 
inch thick. Shake them out till long and straight. Put 
them into boiling salted water, stir them at first to pre- 
vent sticking, and cook until they swell and come to the 
top of the w^ater. Skim them out into a dish for serv- 
ing. Melt half a cup of butter in a frying pan, put 
half a slice of bread, crumbled finely, in the butter, 
stir until golden brown, then spoon up butter and bread 
and pour over the noodles. Pass sapsago cheese with 
the noodles. 

If any be left over, warm it in butter until a delicate 
brown, and stir in three or four beaten eggs ; serve as 
soon as firm. This makes a nice relish for supper. 

Lentil Soup. — Lentils are rich in proteid material, and 
therefore are very suitable when a meat soup is not 
desired. 

Pick over and wash 07ie cup of lentils, and put them on 
to cook in o?ie quart of boiling water. Let them cook 
very slowly until soft and the water reduced one-half. 
Rub the pulp through a strainer, add one pint of milk., 
and, when boiling, thicken with one rounded tablespoon 
flour cooked in one rounded tablespoon butter. Season 
yiiih. pai^rik a, salt, and a dash of sugar, and serve with 
wafers or crot^tons. 

Cream of Onions. — Onions are usually used merely to 
flavor soups, but they may serve as the foundation or 
body of a soup the same as any other vegetable pulp. 
They are especially valuable in the spring, and by many 
are considered as almost a specific for some physical ills. 



496 The Boston Cook Booh. 

The large white Spanish and the Bermuda variety, 
having a mild flavor, are the best for soups. They 
should be peeled, sliced, and scalded for live minutes ; 
then drain quite dry; this will remove much of the 
pungent oil. Then, for a /^i^i^ of sliced onion put one 
rounded tahlesi:>oo7iful of butter in the stewpan, add the 
onions, and let them simmer very slowly for ten minutes. 
Put on boiling water to cover, and let them simmer until 
very soft — about an hour. 

Then rub them through a strainer, add one cup of hot 
milk, thickened with one level teasj:)oo?iful of flour 
cooked in o?ie rotmded tahlespoonful of butter. Season 
with one-fourth of a teasjyoonful of white pepper, one- 
half teaspoon salt. 

Beat yolks of two eggs, add one cup hot cream, and 
put into the tureen. Turn the hot soup over the egg, 
stirring constantly, and serve at once. 



Cream of 1 can peas. 
Canned 1 pint hot water. 
Peas. 1 qt. milk. 

1 teasp. salt. 



1 saltsp. pepper. 
3^2 teasp. sugar. 
1 tbsp. butter. 
1 tbsp. flour. 



Turn the peas from the can into a colander and pour 
cold water over them to remove the taste of the tin. 
Drain and heat slightly in quarter of a cnp of water. 
Rub them through a puree strahier, gradually adding the 
pint of hot water, which will help to separate the pulp 
from the skins. Put the pea pulp and milk on to boil ; 
add the seasoning ; then the butter and flour, which have 
first been cooked together. Stir as it thickens, and, as 
the pea pulp will vary in thickening qualit}^ it may be 
necessary to add more milk or water if too thick, or to 
let it cook longer if too thin. Remember that all vege- 
table cream soups become thicker as they cool, and 
should be served very hot. 

Clam Bouillon. — Select clams in the shell, wash and 
scrub thoroughly and change the water until clean. Put 



Gomho Soup. 497 



them in a kettle with a pint of cold water for half a peck 
of clams. Cover tightly and let them cook until the 
shells open. Skim out the clams, pour off the liquor 
carefully into a pitcher, and let it stand until clear. 
Then pour off again from the sediment, and if too strong 
dilute it with water as desired, and to each quart of 
liquid, add the white aud crumbled shell of one egg, and 
a little pepper. 

Place over the fire and let it boil five mimites, con- 
stantly stirring until the egg, has thickened. Draw it 
back, and when it is clear, strain it carefully. Serve hot 
or cold, in cups with whipped cream and wafers. 

Gombo Soup. — Cut up a chicken as for a fricassee, and 
dredge it thickly with flour. Fry a sliced onion in bacon 
fat, remove the onion and brown the chicken ; brown also 
one quart of sliced okra pods. Place the chicken, onion, 
and okra in a kettle, cover with boiling water, add one 
quart of sliced tomatoes. Simmer until the chicken is 
tender. Remove the larger bones and all the fat. Add 
salt, cayenne, and a very little sugar. Serve it without 
straining and with boiled rice. 



o 



Beef a La Russegue. — Select a piece of beef from the 
under part of the round, or the vein, weighing about 
three pounds. Put it on in boiling water to nearly cover, 
skim as it boils, and let it cook slowly three or four hours 
or until tender. When nearly done, add salt and pepper 
to taste. Remove it from the water aud set away to cool. 
In the water left in the kettle cook one dozen small 
onions. When nearly done, add the same amount of 
small potatoes pared into round shape, or cut with a 
large potato marble cutter. Remove these from the 
water when tender, and set away to cool. 

Half an hour before serving time, cut the meat into 
quarter-inch slices and brown it quickly and delicately in 
hot butter. Use two spiders, so it may l)e done quickly. 
Put the onions and potatoes in the spider, adding more 
butter as needed, and let them color slightly. Then heat 

32 



498 The Boston Cook Boole. 

the water in which the meat was boiled, which should be 
about a pint, add one cup of cream, and thicken it slightly 
with flour wet in cold water. Add more seasoning, if 
needed, and one cup of canned mushrooms, and simmer 
until the mushrooms are hot. Arrange the potato balls 
around the meat, then a row of the onions around the 
potatoes, and dot here and there with the mushrooms. 
Pour the gravy over the meat, enough to cover and show 
under the vegetable garnish. Put a sprig of parsley at 
tUe corners. 

This dish may seem to require considerable time in its 
preparation, but it is a very convenient dish for a six 
o'clock dinner, as the meat and vegetables may be boiled 
in the forenoon ; then it takes but little time to reheat 
them at night. Do not think it can be served as soon as 
the meat and vegetables are cooked and be the same, for 
the flavor of the meat when cooled and then reheated is 
quite unlike that of the freshly boiled meat. And we all 
know how the potato changes in texture and flavor when 
warmed over, and while it may not be as wholesome for 
a delicate stomach, it would not harm others. It is an 
economical and appetizing dish. 

Pepper Pot. — Cover two pounds-of tripe and four calves' 
feet, or a knuckle of veal, with cold water and heat slowly, 
remove the scum, add one red pepper, and cook till the feet 
are tender, then remove the meat, let the liquor cool, skim 
off the fat, heat the liquor again and add seasoning to 
taste, salt, cayenne, and sweet herbs. Cut the tripe and 
the meat in small pieces, and slice about an equal amount 
of potatoes, add them and cook until the potatoes are 
done. When nearly done, add either egg balls or very 
small flour dumplings, and cook ten minutes. 

Salisbury Steak. — Select the middle cut from the top 
of the best round steak. Free it from fat, skin, and fibre. 
Run it three times through a meat chopper. Make into a 
mass about one and one-fourth inch thick, and shape the 



Braised Veal. 499 



edges even. Put it into a wire broiler and lay an iron 
band round it, which will help to keep the meat in shape. 
If the broiler shuts together too closely, bend it out in the 
middle slightly. 

Put it over a Charcoal Broiler Stove and turn every ten 
seconds. Cook from four to six minutes. Lift the edge, 
and as soon as the meat is no longer raw, remove it to a 
hot plate. Sprinkle with salt. In serving, cut into thin 
strips, and let each person spread it with butter as 
desired. 

In this way you have the full, sweet flavor of the butter 
without the injurious effect of melted butter. 

Veal Chops. — These are cut from the loin and ribs, and 
correspond to the sirloin and rib steaks in beef, and to 
the chops in mutton. They are generally more tender 
than the cutlets from the leg, just as sirloin steak is more 
tender than that from the round. 

Loin or kidney chops have quite a piece of fat with 
them which is very sweet and delicious, and sometimes 
the kidney is sold with the chop. 

Trim off the fat and cook it slowly until crisp. Slice 
the kidney, season with salt and pepper, and cook it in 
the fat. 

Trim the chops and remove the bone, if preferred. 
Press into compact shape and season slightly. Roll in 
fine cracker crumbs, then dip in beaten Qgg^ then in 
seasoned crumbs, and cook carefully in the hot fat, 
adding more butter or salt pork fat, if needed. Do not 
let them become too brown. Drain and serve, garnished 
with the crisp fat and sliced kiduey and a bit of parsley. 

Braised Veal. — Chop half a iJOund of fat pork fine, and 
put half of it in the bottom of a broad pot ; sprinkle with 
a tablespoon of chopped carrot, minced onion, a hay leaf^ 
and a sprig of thyme. Lay a breast of veal on this bed, 
and cover with a similar layer. Pour in carefully a quart 
of stock, cover and set on back of the range ; let simmer 



500 The Boston Cooh Boole. 

for two hours, remove the meat, rub over Avith butter, 
then dredge thickly with browned flour. Pour over the 
meat one cupful of the stock, then place in a hot oven 
and bake about half an hour, basting with the remaining 
gravy every few minutes. Serve the veal on a hot platter 
lined with buttered toast, and serve the gravy in a sauce 
boat. Plain boiled spaghetti, or home-made egg noodles 
should be served with it. 

Brown Fricassee of Sweetbreads. — Parboil ten min- 
utes. Remove fat and membranes, dredge with jiour^ 
and fry, till quite brown, in butter^ with a minced onion. 
Add to the butter, one cup of veal stocJc and two table- 
spoonfuls of inushroom ketchup., or half a cup of tomatoes 
and one tahlespoonful of chopped parsley. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper^ cover, and stew slowly for half an 
hour. Strain the gravy, and pour it over the sweetbreads. 

Shoulder of Mutton. — Remove the shoulder blade, 
back, and leg bones, any fine crumbs of bone or stringy 
membranes. Wipe with a wet cloth and rub slightly with 
salt. Roll or fold into shape and tie securely. Put it 
into boiling salted water to cover, remove the scum as 
soon as the water boils again, then turn the meat over 
and skim again. Let it cook gently. When it is nearly 
tender, remove it from the water, drain it, and place it in 
a baking pan. Dredge with salt, pepper, and flour, and 
set it in the oven. Bake until brown and crisp on the 
surface. Baste occasionally with some of the top of the 
water from the kettle, and dredge with flour after basting. 
The whole process will take from two and a half to three 
hours. 

When the meat is suflSciently browned, remove it to a 
hot dish, put the pan on the stove, and let the water 
nearly boil out, leaving only fat in the pan. Stir into 
this fat about two tablespoonfuls of flour, and let them 
brown together. Scrape off all the glaze from the edges, 
and when well colored, add one pint of hot water from 
that used in boiling the lamb, or you may use half water 



Porh Chops. 501 



and half strained tomato. Stir well as it thickens, and 
season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in a gravy 
boat. Remove the strings from the meat, and in serving 
cut at right angles with the back edge. 

After putting the lamb in the oven, put the bones and 
trimmings in the kettle with the water used in the boiling, 
add one onion, and a few bits of carrot and turnip, if you 
happen to have them, and let the whole simmer until the 
bones are clear of all gristle or meat. Then strain the 
liquor and set it away to cool, and the next day you may 
remove the fat, heat it again, and have a delicious lamb 
broth with boiled rice or curry. 

Breaded Chops. — Remove the bone and tough portion 
from six chops cut from the loin or ribs. Pat them into 
shape. Make a dressing of stale bread crumbled, highly 
seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne^ and a little powdered 
thyme, moistened with melted butter and one well beaten 
egg and enough hot water to make it soft enough to 
spread easily. Lay the chops in a dripping pan with 
some of the surplus fat under them. Spread the dress- 
ing smoothly all over the top of each, place them in 
a hot oven, and bake about twenty minutes, or until 
brown. 

Pork Chops. — It will be impossible to cook some pork 
chops, and have them juicy and tender. There is no 
meat that varies so much in quality, or that is so decep- 
tive as fresh pork. The lean must be well marked with 
white lines of fat, or it will be dry and hard. It is often 
put into a very hot spider without any fat, and the sur- 
face quickly becomes very hard and brown. 

Put in a tablespoonful of lard, and when hot lay in the 
chops, and then keep them turning constantly ; reduce the 
heat as soon as the}^ are browned on each side, and cook 
slowly until thoroughly done. Do not salt them until 
just before serving. They may be laid in a greased pan 
and baked quickly in a hot oven. 



502 The Boston Cook Booh. 

Bacon. — Do not buy bacon by the pound, nor have it 
cut in thick slices, if cut at the market, but purchase it by 
the whole strip, freshly cured. It will keep well if the 
paper and burlap cover are replaced whenever opened, 
and is as much a necessity in the storeroom as is a supply 
of flour, sugar, or any other staple article of food. It has 
no equal as an appetizer for breakfast, or in helping out 
when there is but a limited supply of other meat. Served 
with omelets, or some other forms of eggs, crisp curly 
bacon is all the meat necessary for a summer breakfast. 
It is invaluable to boil with greens or other vegetables. 
The fat of bacon is one of the most easily digested forms 
of fat, as the curing and smoking seem to have given it 
some qualities which render it less objectionable than 
when fresh. Many physicians prescribe it in place of 
cod liver oil. 

Transparent Bacon. — Shave off the hard, lean strip 
from bacon, also the smoked edges and rind as far back 
on the strip as j^ou require for one meal. Then with a 
very sharp knife shave off in slices not more than an 
eighth of an inch thick. Lay them in a hot frying pan, 
and turn as soon as transparent ; cook a moment on the 
other side, tip the spider and let the fat drain away from 
the bacon. Then serve alone or with eggs, beefsteak, 
veal cutlets, liver, or oysters. The slices may be laid in 
a fine wire broiler and cooked over a clear hot fire, or the 
broiler laid in a pan and the whole placed in a hot oven 
until transparent. 

Keep the bacon in a cold place, that it may be hard and 
firm before slicing, and if not ready to fry immediately, 
put the slices in the refrigerator until wanted. 

Crisp Bacon. — Prepare as directed for Transparent 
Bacon, then shave in the thinnest possible slices ; never 
mind if they are not entire slices so long as they are mere 
shavings. Take two or three tablespoonfuls of clear 
bacon fat from a previous frying, or use lard if you have 



Fo^vl. 503 

no bacon fat ; let it become quite hot in a small pan, then 
pat the bacon in, stir it quickly with a fork for one 
minute, and skim it out as soon as it rattles. It should 
be only slightly colored, if dark brown, it has been over- 
cooked. Drain on paper. Should the bacon prove to be 
very salt, it may be soaked in milk over night after slicing, 
then drain, roll in very fine crumbs, or flour, and cook it 
quickly in hot fat. 

With a gas stove bacon is readily made crisp by broil- 
ing. Then no additional fat is required. 

Smothered Fowl. — Clean a fowl suitable only for boil- 
ing ; stuft' and truss as for roasting. Put it in a large 
deep kettle or jar. Parboil some white beans, season 
the same as for baking, and put them in the kettle wdth 
the fowl, — under, around, and over the fowl. Add 
water and a small piece of pork. Cover, and bake 
slowly about eight hours. Add water as it boils away, 
and treat the same as for beans alone. Pour the beans 
out, remove the fowl carefully, put it on a large platter, 
and garnish with the beans. If more convenient, the 
fowl may be cut as for a fricassee. 

Hungarian Chicken or Paprika Huhn. — Put one heaped 
tahlespoonful butter or dripplurj in a tight stew pan, add 
two good-sized onions sliced thin and left in long strips. 
When slightly colored, add half teaspoonful of Biaiffa- 
rian pepjjer ov paprika^ and mix well and let them brown. 
Then add the chicken cut in pieces, and salted and pep- 
pered. Brown well, turning often. Then add stock or 
water till nearly covered. Stew until tender. Just be- 
fore serving, take out the meat, put on a hot platter, and 
add a full ludf cup or more of thick sour cream. Just 
let it scald, but do not boil it, pour it over the chicken 
and serve at once. 

Croustades of Chicken. — Cover the outside of small 
moulds or tin corn-cake cups with thin puff paste. Prick 



504 The Boston Cooh Booh, 

and bake, remove from the moulds and fill with mixture 
of mushrooms and chicken breasts chopped fine and 
moistened with highly-seasoned cream sauce. 

Roast Mallard or Teal Ducks. — Singe, draw, and re- 
move all the tiny piufeathers. Then wash very quickly, 
both inside and out, with cool water and wipe perfectly 
dry. For the stuffing, take equal parts of chopped tart 
ap'ples^ of bread crumbs which have been browned in the 
oven and sifted, and of boiled 07iions. Season highly 
with salt and pepper^ and a little sage^ and moisten with 
tv'o or three tablespoonfids of melted butter. Stufi" the 
ducks, sew and truss. Put on a rack in a pan, sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, and a little flour. Cover with small 
slices of salt pork and put into a very hot oven. In 
about five minutes the ducks will be light brown. Now 
reduce the heat and pour into the pan a very little water. 
The dripping fat will burn unless a little hot water is 
added. Baste every four or five minutes. In forty 
minutes the ducks will be sufficiently cooked, if liked a 
trifle rare, but many prefer a longer cooking. When 
nearly done, the pork must be removed and the birds 
evenly browned on all sides. Serve with 

Olive Sauce. — Skim off some of the fat in the dripping 
pan until only/(>?r/* tahlespoonfuls remain. To this add 
four tahlespoonfuls of browned flour., stir, then add slowly 
one and a half cups of boiling water. Let it boil until 
slightly thickened, stirring constantly, then add four 
tahlespoonfuls of olive pulp cut in small pieces, one tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice and one teaspoonful of caramel. 

Roast Duck, No. 2. — Prepare as directed in first recipe, 
and stuff with stale bread crumbs.^ seasoned with a little 
melted butter^ salt, pepper, and three-fourths of a cuj) of 
chopped celerg. Place the duck on the bottom of the 
pan and not on the rack, and put close around it a siceet 
potatOy Si carrot, and Vi parsnip, each of them pared and 



Babbit Fricassee. 505 



Gilt in halves. AYheu the duck is basted, baste the vege- 
tables also, and when the duck has been taken from the 
pan, mash the vegetables in the drippings and press 
through the sieve. Add about o?ie and a half cups of 
boiling ivater, season and serve in a gravy boat. The 
vegetables take the place of flour in thickening, help to 
flavor, and we think this is a very good everyday gravy 
for ducks. (^21iss Souther.) 

A Missouri Dainty. — Cut a carefully dressed young 
squirrel or rabbit into pieces for frying ; rub each piece 
with salt., pepper^ and dust with a trifle of viace\ dredge 
well with flour, and fry to a rich brown in half butter and 
half lard. Remove the meat from the pan, add a heaping 
tablespoonful of flour., and when it is brown, enough 
seasoned soup stock to make a gravy as thick as cream. 
Next place the meat in a porcelain-lined pot, or earthen- 
ware "cooking-crock," pour over it the gravy, and a 
generous cupful of tomatoes., which have been well stewed 
down and seasoned with salt., pepper., and a grated onion ; 
place a tight-fitting lid on the vessel, stand it on a muffin 
ring in a moderate oven, and let it cook for three hours. 

Rabbit Fricassee with Curry. — Select a fat, young, 
wild rabbit, which, if fresh, will have no unpleasant odor. 
Skin and clean it, and remove the head and neck, which 
are not to be used. Split it down the back, then disjoint 
it, or cut into convenient pieces. ATipe off with a clean 
wet cloth, and if you prefer you may soak it half an hour 
in salted water. Season with salt and pepper., dredge 
withyfoz^?', and brown slightly in hot butter ov salt pork 
fat. Put the meat into a stewpan. In the fat left in 
the saucepan, put one sliced onion and cook until slightly 
colored. Mix two teaspoonfuls of curry powder.^ one 
teaspoonful of sugar, and one heajnng tablespoonful of 
flour^ and brown them in the butter. Add slowly one 
pint of ivater, one cup of strained tomato, six raisiiis 
seeded., one cup of chopped sour apple, a dash of cay^ 



5o6 Tlie Boston Cooh Booh 

enne^ and salt to taste. Turn this sauce over the rabbit, 
and let it simmer until the flesh is very tender. When 
ready to serve, add one cup of hot milk and quarter of a 
cup of chopped olives. Have ready one cup of Wee, 
cooked in boiling water until soft, turn the rabbit into a 
platter and pile the rice around the edge. 

Brown Fricassee of Partridge. — Dress and clean a pair 
of partridges, split them through the back and breast as 
for broiling. Fry two slices of salt pork in a Scotch 
bowl or other deep iron kettle. Remove the scraps, lay 
the partridges in, and brown them carefully. Then 
add 07ie ciq) of boiling water; cover the kettle closely 
and let it cook very slowly. Keep that amount of water 
in the kettle, adding a little as it boils away. Cook until 
very tender, about two hour§. Then take out the meat, 
remove the fat from the gravy and pour in half a (yup 
of tomato ketchup ; thicken it with a little flour mixed 
with cold water. Add more salt if needed, put the meat 
in again, and when heated through, serve on a shallow 
dish with browned sweet potatoes, (Ilrs. Webster.) 

Baked Quail. — Pick, draw, and wipe the birds outside 
and inside with a wet cloth. Be careful to remove any 
shot in the flesh. Cut the wings and neck off close to 
the body, but leave the feet on. Take two oysters to 
each bird.) dip them in melted butter ^ then in cracker 
crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper. Put them into 
the body, tie the feet and fasten them through the tail 
with a small wooden skewer so they will cover the open- 
ing. Rub the breasts with softened butter and dredge with 
flour. Pin a thin piece of fat salt pork on the breast, 
arrange them in a baking pan so they will keep breast 
up. Place them in a hot oven and bake twelve minutes. 
Baste with melted butter and water three times during the 
baking. They have a dry white meat, and should be well 
done and be basted frequently to make them delicious. 

Have ready a small slice of nicely toasted bread, no 



Chafing- dish. 507 



crusts, and moisten it slightly with hot salt water. Dish 
the birds on the toast without spilling any of the juice 
from the inside, as this is needed on the toast. Remove 
the skewers and pork, and garnish with cauliflower. 

Broiled Squabs. — Remove the feathers, split down the 
back, remove the entrails, and wipe clean. Rub all over 
with soft butter^ and dredge with salt and pepper. Lay 
them in a piece of buttered letter-paper, inside down, cross 
the legs over the outside, and fold the edges under to shape 
it well. Fold the paper over and fold the edges together. 
Broil over a clear fire about eight minutes. Spread cur- 
rant-jelly on some hot buttered toast ; lay a bird on each 
slice, with a little jelly on the breast. Pour over them 
the juice from the papers, and serve very hot. 

ON THE CHAFING-DISH. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Spread /o?^r slices of hot toast with 
a thin layer of j^otted ham. Beat/oi^r eggs slightly with 
a fork, season with salt and pepjper., add half ix cupful of 
milk. Turn into a hot buttered chafing-pan, and stir 
with a fork until the ^g^ is slightly thickened. Turn at 
once on the toast, and serve quickly. 

Tomato Omelet. — Fry three slices of bacon crisp, re- 
move it, and in the same fat cook one sliced onion until 
light brown. Beat three eggs slightly, season with cay- 
enne.) add three tablespoonfuls of thick stewed tomato^ 
the fried onions and the crisp bacon, finely crumbled. 
Turn into a greased chafing-pan, and pick it up with a 
fork as the egg thickens, then let it color slightly, roll 
over and turn out onto a hot platter. 

Scotch "Woodcock. — First toast and butter some bread 
on both sides, and spread on this some chopped a?ichovies. 
Beat the yolks of four eggs with half Vi pint of cream., and 
thicken this for a few moments in the chafing-dish without 
letting it come to a boil. Arrange the small pieces of 
toast into a little pyramid and pour the q^^ over it. 



5o8 The Boston Cooh Book. 



Deviled Eggs and Anchovy Toast. — Put a ivalnut of 
butter in the chafing-dish, half 2^ teaspoonful of dry mus- 
tard^ two tablespoonfids of tomato sauce, one taOlesj^oonful 
of JVorcestershire, and one of viushroom catsup. Put into 
this four hard-boiled eggs, sliced, salted, and peppered. 
When heated, place the eggs on toast previously spread 
with anchovy paste. 

Creamed Eggs. — Put into the chafing-dish one tea- 
spoonful butter and place the pan over the bath. Beat 
three eggs slightly, add half a cup thin cream and a salt- 
spoonful pepper. Turn into the butter and stir constantlj^ 
as it thickens. Sprinkle with salt, and turn out while 
moist and soft. 

Lobster Newberg. — Eemove the meat from a large 
lobster and cut it into half-inch pieces. Have ready the 
yolks of four eggs beaten with one pint of rich cream. 
Put two heaped tablespoons of butter into a hot chafing- 
dish, remove the pan containing the hot water, and cover 
it while you put the blazer over the flame. Add to the 
lobster, four tablespoons of sherry, one tablesjjoon of 
brandy, and a saltspoon of red pepper, and let them cook 
five minutes. Place the pan of boiling water underneath,

String I qt. butter beans. 

Beans, 1 hpd. tbsp. butter. 

German 1 saltsp. pepper. 
Style. 



saltsp. nutmeg, 
tsp. salt. 



Break off the ends and strings, and if the latter do not 
come off readily, take a thin sharp paring knife and pare off 
the thickest string on the inside edge of the pod, taking as 
thin a strip as possible. Hold the bean with this edge 
toward you, and cut in thin slanting pieces not more than 
an inch and a half long, holding the back edge of the 
pod against the left forefinger. I give this minute 
direction because many of my pupils have found it dif- 
ficult to get the knack of cutting them "on the bias," as 
we call it, and it does make a difference in the flavor if 
they are broken or snapped in the old way. It takes 
time to do this, but after you learn the art, it can be 
done as quickly as one shells peas. Beans prepared in 
this way require much less time for cooking, and house- 
keepers who often give up having a dinner of string beans 
because they could not get them on at nine o'clock, or do 
not want a hot fire all the morning, will do well to try 
this recipe. Do not be afraid to use the nutmeg. You 
will not recognize it, yet you will miss something if you 
omit it. 

If the beans are not fresh from the vines, it may be 
well to put them in cold water before cutting, to make 
them more crisp and firm. After slicing, put them again 
into cold water, but do not prepare them more than half 
an hour before needed. Put the butter, salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg into a broad granite stewpan having a tight cover, 



Puree of Green Beans. 513 

and when the butter is melted, take the beans from the 
water in handfuls, with only the water that clings to 
them, and put them into the butter. 

Add no more water. Cover tightly, and as soon as 
they are hot set them where they will cook very slowly. 
The butter and liquid that is drawn from the beans will 
make sufficient moisture to steam the beans, and they will 
be perfectly tender if cooked slowly- and of finer flavor than 
when deluged with water. Stir them up from the bottom 
occasionally, and so long as there is barely liquid enough 
to cover the bottom of the pan they are safe. If they 
cook too rapidly, and become quite dry, you may add two 
or three tablespoonfuls of water. They should be quite 
dry except for the coating of butter, when done, and 
being already seasoned they are simply turned into the 
dish and sent at once to the table. 

Small fresh-picked beans will cook in from thirty to 
forty minutes, larger or stale ones sometimes requu-e 
nearly an hour. It will do no harm to let them stand 
some time in the kettle on the back of the stove or be- 
yond the chance of burningj if they are tender before you 
are ready for them. 

Puree of Green Beans. — One of the most wholesome, 
delicious, and convenient ways of using Lima or other 
shelled beans while in the green state is in a puree. 
Cook the beans in boiling water for ten minutes, then 
drain, rinse, and put again into boiling water, plenty of it, 
:»^nd cook until very tender. Turn into a puree strainer 
and press all the pulp through. Put on to boil again, and 
add milk or cream sufficient to make it the usual puree 
consistency. For each quart of the mixture, cook one 
tablespoonful each of butter and flour together as for 
white sauce, and stir it into the boiling liquid. Season 
with salt and pepper. Serve with wafers. 

It is convenient to cook a quantity of the beans at once 
and sift them, then add milk and thickening only to what- 
ever portion may be needed for that meal.

514 The Boston Cook Booh. 

Cucumber Sauce. — Pare two cucumbers. Cut leugth- 
wise in quarters, remove the seeds if large, chop fine and 
squeeze dry. Season with salt^ paprika^ and vinegar, and 
stir in one-half cup of thick cream whipped stiff. This is 
especially suitable for broiled fish. 

Stewed Cucumbers. — Pare the large cucumbers, cut 
lengthwise into four parts, and remove the large seeds. 
Soak them half an hour in cold water. Cook in boiling 
salted water to cover until tender. Drain off the water ; 
add a little butter, salt, and pepper, and, when well 
heated, serve on toast ; or make a thin white sauce and 
pour over them. This is worth trying. 

Heidelberg Carrots. — Wash and scrape three medium- 
sized carrots, cut into pieces about an inch and a half 
long, then into thin slices lengthwise, and then again into 
thin strips about like short matches. Put them into cold 
water for a few moments, and then cook in boiling salted 
water, barely enough to keep from burning. They will 
cook tender in from twenty to thirty minutes. For about 
one pint of the carrot allow one heaping teaspoon each of 
butter and flour ^ creamed together ; stir it into the boiling 
liquid. There should be but a few spoonfuls, but by 
tipinng the pan toward yon they can be blended easily. 
Add half a teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper^ let it 
boil about five minutes, then sprinkle over a little fine 
parsley ; turn into the dish and sprinkle again with pars- 
ley, using about one teaspoonful in all. 

Sweet Carrots. — The carrots are best cut in quarter 
inch dice. Boil them in salt water uncovered. When 
they are almost tender, pour off all but perhaps a quarter 
of a cup of the water, put them back on the stove, 
sprinkle with two or three, table sjjoonfuls of sugar and 
allow them to cook until the water has boiled away, shak- 
ing the pot occasionally and shifting the carrots from top 
to bottom with a fork that they may all come in contact 
with the sweetened water. They should be decidedly 



Italian Chestnuts. 5 1 5 

sweet. When the liquid is absorbed, melt a tablespoori- 
fal of butter in the carrots, and pour over a teaspoonful 
of lemon juice, and they are ready. 

German Cabbage. — Cut a two-inch cube of fat salt pork 
in dice and fry it slightly in the bottom of the stewpan, 
add one cup of boiling water, and tivo quarts of shredded 
cabbage, and one sour apjyie cut fine. Cook one hour very 
slowly. When it is half done, add half a cup of vinegar. 

Summer Squash. — Use only very young, tender 
squashes. AVash and cut off the stem, lay them in a 
kettle with barely water enough to keep them from 
burning on, and cook until tender. Drain and let the 
water boil down to a thick syrup, add butter, salt and 
pepper. Cut the squash in portions for serving, and 
pour the seasoned sauce over it. In this way the deli- 
cate flavor of the squash is retained. 

Summer Squash, No. 2. — Steam the squash until tender. 
Then put into a cheese-cloth strainer and squeeze out 
some of the water. Mash and break up fine, and season 
with salt, pepper, and butter. 

Fried Squash. — Cut j^oung tender squash in half-inch 
slices, dip in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Cook 
slowly in hot butter or salt pork fat, until browned. 

Italian Chestnuts. (Lia Band.) — Two poimds of large 
chestnuts, the shells taken clean off with a very sharp 
knife. Pour boiling water over them and the under skin 
will come off readily. Peel and cut upfoiir red onions, 
stew them in butter until soft, but not brown. Add the 
peeled chestnuts, and pour over them enough soup stock 
to keep them moist without burning. Salt them but not 
too much. When the chestnuts are nearly done, add to 
them four large cqojyles peeled, cored, and sliced. Add 
them to the chestnuts, and let them simmer until done. 
Then add sugar to taste. 

This dish has a very rich flavor, and may be well worth 
trying by those who want a new combination. 



5i6 The Boston Cook Book. 

Many poor families in Italy derive their principal sus- 
tenance from the fruit of the chestnut-trees. The nuts 
are peeled, dried in the sun, ground into flour, and made 
into bread. The chestnuts are used also in soups, sauces, 
purees, forcemeats, entrees, and sweet dishes for dessert. 

Barley a la Strassburg. — Pour boiling water over Jialf 
a ciqj of pearl barley ; remove any specks or insects, and 
drain dry. Melt o?ie tablespoon butter in a stewpan ; add 
the barley, and let it cook until slightly browned and it 
has absorbed the butter. Then add one quart of thin 
stock and let it boil until tender and dry. Season with 
salt and serve as a vegetable. 

Lentil Hash. {Dr. Alice B. Stockton.) — Take one pint 
cooked lentils., one-lialf ijint of cold potatoes chopped fine, 
tivo tablespoonfuls chopped 07i/o??5, one tablespoonful salt, 
one-half tea spoonful pejyper, two tablespoonfuls butter ., one- 
halfciqy milk., cook slowly for an hour, then brown and turn. 

The lentils used for the above should already have been 
cooked at least eight hours in a double boiler at a tem- 
perature of about 200°. When thus cooked they can be 
used for hash, croquettes, soup, and many other purposes. 

B. B. B. Cakes. — A cupful more or less of cold baked 
beans may be left after the family are tired of seeing this 
dish for Saturday's supper, Sunday's breakfast, and wash- 
ing day lunch, and yet it seems wasteful to throw them 
away. Sift them, and if very dry add a little hot water 
to moisten enough to shape them into small flat cakes. 
First season them with salt, if needed, and mustard. Cook 
one tablespoonful of chopped onion in a little x>ork fat or 
butter^ and when slightly colored put in the cakes and 
brown on each side. Serve with toasted brown bread. 

Baked Corn and Beans. — Take equal quantities of shelled 
beans and sweet corn cut from the cob, — put them into 
a bean-pot in layers, sprinkling salt and pepper between 
each layer. For one pyint eacli of corn and beans take 
one-half pound salt jmrk., score the rind and place in the 



Mushrooms. 5 1 7 



top of the bean-pot, letting the rind come up even with 
the corn and beans. "' Cover with boiling water and bake 
slowly seven or eight hours, adding more water as it 
cooks away. 

A Rice Course for a Green- and- "White Luncheon. — 

Put one cup of rice and one cup and a half of boiling wate)^ 
in a small tightly covered stewpan over the fire, and let it 
boil rapidly without raising the cover until the steam from 
the rice lifts the cover. When done, the rice will be full 
of steam holes. Season with salt, pepper, and butter. 
Drain the liquor from a can of peas, rinse them in cold 
water ; put on to heat, with one tablespoon of butter; 
salt, pepper, and sugar to taste. 

Arrange a portion of rice on a lettuce leaf, making a 
slight depression in the centre, into which pile a portion 
of the peas. Sprinkle a little grated cheese over the whole. 

Mushrooms. Campestris. ^- Clean, peel the caps, and 
broil from six to ten minutes. Cook the gill side first. 
When done, spread at once with butter, creamed and 
flavored with lemon and parsley. 

Baked Mushrooms. — Place the caps on toast, spread 
with prepared maitre d'hotel butter, and bake in a cov- 
ered dish from twelve to fifteen minutes. 

Fried Green Tomatoes. — Cut off both ends from nice, 
large, green tomatoes, cut in thin slices ; roll them in 
flour, and cook them in hot butter in the frying-pan. 
Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and sugar, and cook until 
brown. Fry a sliced onion with them if you like the 
flavor. Serve them with fish-balls. 

Potatoes au Gratin. — One cup ivhite sauce, one pint 
cold boiled pofrtfo dice, one-half cup craclcer crumbs moist- 
ened with one tablespoon melted butter, find one-half cup 
cheese. Put potatoes, cheese, and sauce, two layers of 
each, in buttered baking dish, cover with crumbs and 
bake fifteen minutes. 



5i8 The Boston Cooh Booh. 

Potatoes Warmed in Stock. — Cut into half-inch dice, 
or into thin slices, enough cold boiled potatoes to make 
one pint. Season well with salt^ pepper^ fine-chopped pa?'s- 
ley^ and one teaspoon of lemon juice. Cook one sliced 
onion in one tablespoon beef dripping until you have a 
strong odor of the onion, but do not burn them. Add 
the potatoes, and cook a few minutes, or until slightly 
browned; toss them up and brown again, then add one 
cup of corned beef liquor^ and let them simmer until the 
liquor is nearly absorbed. One-fourth part of cold beet 
and vinegar may take the place of the parsley and lemon, 
to make another variety. 

Radishes. — The small, smooth, round, or slightly oval 
red radishes are generally preferred, although occasionally 
we find the long pointed varieties both red and white. The 
red skin is sometimes nearly removed by scraping, as it is 
objectionable to some tastes, but it adds so much to the 
attractive appearance of the table that it seems a pity to 
lose it. Trim off the fine roots and cut the leaves about 
an inch from the root. The delicate green will contrast 
prettily with the red, and the stems make a convenient 
handle. Put them in a pan of ice water till firm and 
crisp. With a small sharp knife begin at the point, and 
make several slight incisions through the skin merely, 
down about half-way and one-third inch or more apart. 
Slip the point of the knife under the skin at each point 
and separate it from the flesh. Press the points outward 
slightly, then let them remain in ice water, and when 
ready to serve you will find them open at the cut end like 
a flower. When the radishes are large, the point of each 
petal may be rounded off slightly to imitate a tulip. Use 
them as a garnish for meat or salads, or arrange them in 
a small glass dish, as a part of the table decoration, or 
serve two with t^wo or three olives on fancy individual 
dishes at each plate. Salt is the only condiment needed. 

Spring Salad. — In a salad bowl put first a layer of 
fresh crisp watercress, then a layer of thinly sliced cu- 



Salads. 519 



cumbers which have been soaked in cold water fifteen 
minutes, then a teaspoonful of minced chives, then an- 
other layer of cucumbers, and around the edge a light 
border of the cresses. When ready to sei-ve, pour a 
French dressing over it and toss it over until well 
mingled. This is appropriate to serve with a course of 
broiled fish. 



Lincoln 1 quart oysters. 
Salad. 3 cucumbers. 
1 tsp. salt. 



1 saltsp. black pepper. 
1 bunch watercresses. 
cream dressing to moisten. 



Pick over the oysters and parboil until the edges curl, 
drain very dry, cool and cut into small uniform pieces. 
Pare the cucumbers and leave in cold water until needed. 
Then cut into quarters lengthwise (sixths, if very large), 
trim off the edge containing the seeds, then dry on a 
towel and cut into thin slices. Season them highly with 
salt and black pepper, and add them to the oysters. 
Moisten with cream dressing, turn into a salad bowl 
lined with cresses, put some of the best sprigs on the 
edge, and cover with the remainder of the dressing. 

German Cucumber Salad. — The slightly acid juice of 
the cucumber is disagreeable to many delicate stomachs, 
and this is drawn out largely by this method of preparing 
them. We have been taught that cucumbers should be 
crisp and firm, and that if wilted or soft the}^ were not 
suitable to serve. But 1 have eaten them frequently dur- 
ing the last season, prepared as below, and found them 
delicious and less likeh' to remind me of their presence in 
my internal economy than when served in our way. 

This method also enables one to use cucumbers that are 
older than we generally like to have them, as the seeds 
which are the objectionable part when the fruit is too 
ripe, are not served. 

Pare the cucumbers, and then cut them in half-inch 
slices. Then pare each slice as thinly as possible from 
the outside to the seed part, making a long, thin, curling 
strip. Cover them with cold water and add one round 



520 TliQ Boston Cook Book. 

teaspoon of salt for each cucumber. Let them soak until 
soft, from one to two hours. Then drain off the water 
and squeeze them in a soft cloth until quite dry. Toss 
them up in a salad bowl and dress with cayenne, oil, and 
vinegar, and serve very cold. 

Apple and Celery Salad. — Have the celery nicel}^ cleaned 
and crisped by keeping it in a damp napkin on the ice 
until just before ready to use. Then cut it into thin 
crescent-shaped slices. With a silver knife pare and 
core some mildly tart apples, cut into eighths or narrower, 
if very large apples are used, and then cut across the 
sections into thin slices. Use equal parts of celery and 
apple. Mix in sufficient mayonnaise dressing to hold the 
pieces together. Arrange crisp cup-shaped lettuce leaves 
on a pretty shallow dish, put a portion of the mixture on 
each leaf, dot the top with a teaspoon of the mayonnaise, 
and serve quickly. Do not pare the apple until ready to 
put the mixture together. A simple French dressing may 
be used if preferred, and by many would be thought more 
suitable for a dinner salad. 

No. 2. Whip one cuj:) of thick well-chilled cream, with 

an egg-beater or fork until thick, then add gradually suf- 
ficient lemon juice to thin it slightly, and season with half 
a teaspoonful of celery salt and a s^yoonfid of paprika. 
Use a thin-skinned tart apple. Wipe, quarter, and core 
without paring, divide again lengthwise into two or three 
pieces, then slice very thin. For two cups of the cjyj^le 
use 07ie cup of fine cut celery. Moisten with the cream 
dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange 
in a shallow^ glass dish and garnish with green celery tips 
and crescents of the red apples. 

Chestnut, Apple, and Celery Salad. — Prepare the apple 
and celery as directed in the first recipe. Shell, parboil, 
and skin the large French chestnuts. Roil twelve min- 
utes, or until soft, but not broken. Drain, and when cool 



Salads. 521 



cut them into thin slices. Use one cup of each measured 
after slicing. Season highly with a French dressing, and 
keep in a cold place. Serve in a salad bowl surrounded 
with crisp lettuce. 

Apple and Onion Salad. — Boil one cup of vinegar. If 
strong, use half water. Mix one teaspoonful mustard^ one 
teaspoonful cornstarch^ one-half teaspoonful salt, and one- 
half salt spoonful pepper with one well-beaten egg. Stir this 
into the boiling vinegar and cook until creamy. Pour it 
over two mildly acid apples and one onion chopped fine. 
Serve it with lettuce cups. 

Nut Salad. — Equal parts of apple, celery, and nuts. 
Cut the apple in eighths, pare and cut from the end in 
thin slices. Split the celery stalks if they are wide, and 
then lay several together and shave off in thin crescents. 

Use almonds, peanuts, pecans, or walnuts. Salted al- 
monds and peanuts may be chopped medium fine, pecans 
and walnuts crumbled, or chopped. Some prefer to par- 
boil the walnuts and remove the skin ; the slight cooking 
softens them somewhat. It is not necessary to have 
equal parts of each, for with almost any proportion that 
I have chanced to have, if the seasoning has been right, 
the salad has been good. 

Mix with a ma^^onnaise dressing and serve with or 
without crisp lettuce. Salt and pepper the mixture well 
before adding the mayonnaise. 

Fruit Salad. — Remove the sections of pineapple with a 
silver fork. Stone the cherries, being careful to save the 
juice. Hull the berries, mix all together, place on lettuce 
leaves and garnish with stars of mayonnaise dressing. 

Another w^ay : Make a bed of lettuce leaves on a 
glass dish, keeping the fruit separated one from the 
other; make three mounds, and garnish in the same way. 
Select the dark, almost black cherries, as it gives 3^ou 
three distinct colors. Use equal parts of pineapple, cher- 
ries, and strawberries. 



1^22 The Boston Cook Booh. 

Fruit Cups. — Cut oranges in lialves and with a spoon 
scoop ont the pulp and juice, then scrape out the white 
membrane and set the cups in a pan of ice. Cut Malaga 
grapes in halves and remove the seeds. If the skins are 
tough, peel them before cutting. Have equal parts of 
grapes and banana, cut in small pieces. Add the juice 
of one lemon to the juice of three oranges, and sweeten 
it quite sweet. Add also a dash of salt. Fill the orange 
cups with the mixture of fruits, pour the sweetened juice 
over the fruit, and put a spoonful of thick whipped cream 
on top. Serve very cold. 

Tomato Jelly Salad. — Soak one-half box of gelatine in 
one-half cuj) of cold tvater fifteen minutes, or till soft. 
Stew one can of tomatoes till soft, cutting and mashing 
the pulp to hasten the process. For additional flavoring, 
stew with the tomato a half inch bit of bay leaf one-half 
teaspoon of mixed whole spices, one rounded tablespoon 
of celery salt, and one-half 2l small Bermuda onion. Strain 
the tomato through a puree sieve, and if there is not 
enough to make three cups add boiling water. Heat 
again to boiling point, add the soaked gelatine, stir till 
dissolved, then pour it into small cups or fancy moulds, 
or into a ring mould, if individual forms are not desired. 
Chill, and when ready to serve, turn out and serve the 
small forms on lettuce leaves with maj^onnaise on the 
top. Or turn the ring mould out on a salad dish, fill 
the centre with any salad mixture you prefer, and garnish 
with any appropriate border of green. 

Salad in Tomato Jelly Cups. — Soak one-half box of 
gelatine in one ciip of cold loater in which some celery has 
been stewed. Put into a stewpan one quart can of toma- 
toes, one tablespoon of minced parsley, one tablespoon 
of chives, one teaspoon of salt, one-fourth teaspoon of 
paprika, two tablespoons of lemon Juice, and tico carda- 
mom seeds. Stew until the pulp is tender, then strain it, 
without pressure, heat again t>) a boiling point, add the 
soaked gelatine and strain it again into a pitcher. Have

ready two sizes of small rouud moulds or cups. Put the 
larger moulds in a pan and surround them with broken 
ice. Pour in jelly to the depth of one-third inch. When 
firm, place the smaller mould inside and add a few spoon- 
fuls of jelly between the moulds. When this is firm, add 
the remainder till the larger moulds are filled. Fill the 
smaller mould with broken ice to hasten the process. 
When the jelly is firm, remove the ice, add hot water to 
the smaller mould till it can be lifted out carefully. Fill 
the space with oyster salad, or any preferred salad, and 
when ready to serve, invert on a dish, and garnish with 
whipped cream dressing and watercress. 

Salad of Remnants. — Mix ojie cup of cold boiled celery 
cut in bits, one cup of cooked cauliflower^ and one-half cup 
of canned butter beans. If you have no mayonnaise 
dressing left over, or do not like the oil in the plain 
French dressing, make a cream dressing as follows : Mix 
one-fourth teaspoon of mustard, one-fourth teaspoon of 
salt, one-half teaspoon of sugar, and a few grains oi pap>- 
rika. Add the yolk of one egg and mix well, then the 
white beaten till foamy (not stiff), and one tablespoon of 
thick cream. Gradually add one fourth cup of hot vine- 
gar, and cook over boiling water till it thickens, stirring 
constantly. When cold pour it over the mixed vege- 
tables. Or the vegetables may be arranged in groups, 
each kind by itself, and the dressing served separately. 

Asparagus. — Break off the stalks where they are tender, 
wash, tie in a bundle, cook in boiling water till tender. 
Drain, cut into inch pieces, and pour white sauce over it, 
using only enough to moisten. 

Asparagus Salad. — Use only about three inches of the 
tip end, and cook as directed above, and chill it thor- 
oughly. Serve it on a platter, and pass with it a French 
dressing, served in small dishes, into which each stalk 
may be dipped as desired.

Potato Salad. — Boil potatoes without paring, and re- 
move when not quite soft. Peel, and when cool slice 
thin, and season with salt and pepper. To one quarts 
allow one small onion sliced, and double the rule for 
French dressing. Mix thoroughly, and add more oil and 
vinegar if needed. Potatoes vary in the amount they will 
absorb. Chill thoroughly, and serve with a garnish of 
lettuce, parsley, celery, or boiled egg.

one saltspoonful mustard, one cup oil added in small por- 
tions until the mixture thickens, two tablespoonfuls lemon 
juice, and when ready to use, stir in half a cup of sour 
cream. 

Cream Salad Dressing. — A small quantity of salad 
dressing may be made very quickly in an emergency, by 
simply mixing two teaspoon/ids of vinegar or lemon juice 
with four tablespoonfids of sweet or sour cream, and 
seasoning with a speck of cayenne and salt and peiypter 
to taste. 



Sandwiches. 525 



Whipped Cream Dressing. — Surround one cup of thick 
cream with broken ice, and whip it stiff with a wire whisk 
or egg-beater. Add gradually three tablespoons of lemon 
juice, three of grated horse-radish, one-half teaspoon of 
salt, and one-fourth teaspoon of paprika. It should be 
stiff enough to keep in shape when dropped from the 
spoon. Keep it very cold till ready to serve. Mix a 
small portion of it with the oysters and cucumbers, and 
use the remainder for a garnish. (See Lincoln Salad.) 

Lettuce Salad with Claret Dressing. — Mix one teaspoon 
of German mustard, one-half teaspoon of salt, one-eighth 
teaspoon of freshly-ground pepper, four tablespoons of 
olive oil, one tablespoon of claret. Have a head of let- 
tuce washed and drained dry. Tear it into bits, put it 
in the bowl, pour the dressing over it, and toss about until 
well dressed. 

Boiled Dressing. {Mrs. Webster.) — M^^t one-half cup 
vinegar in the top of the double boiler. In a small bowl, 
mix thoroughly, tv:o level teaspoons of mustard, two 
level teaspoons of salt, three level tablespoons of sugar

all into the hot vinegar in tlie double boiler. Cook like 
boiled custard, stirring constantly, and be careful that it 
does not curdle. 

Sorrento Sandwiches. — Boil the liver from a pair of 
chickens until very tender, rub through a strainer, aud 
mix it with an equal amount of olives chopped very fine. 
Moisten with mayonnaise dressing, and put between two

onnaise dressing. Add more salt and cayenne if desired. 
Spread it on the bread, cover with a layer of thin slices 
of encumber, then another round of bread, press lightly, 
and arrange them in an overlapping circle around a few 
sprigs of parsley. 

Sweetbread Sandwiches. — Break up one cold boiled 
sweetbread, remove the membranes and press through 
a potato-ricer. Moisten with half as much thick whipped 
cream, and season to taste with salt, cayenne, and lemon 
juice. Spread on thin slices of bread, cover with the 
leaves of watercress and another slice of buttered bread, 
press, and cut into triangles. 

Lettuce Sandwiches. — Select nice tender, crisp lettuce, 
wash and dry well, but do not make the sandwiches until 
just before serving. 

Butter the bread and cover with the lettuce, and spread 
a thin layer of salad dressing on the other slice, and })ress 
them together tightly. Cut in halves, or cut into rounds 
before filling. Tear the lettuce to fit the slices. When 
a rich mayonnaise is used, it is not necessary to spread 
with butter, although many recipes call for it. 

Flower Sandwiches. — Sweet clover, sweet peas, vio- 
lets, roses, cinnamon pinks, apple blossoms, nasturtiums, 
and heliotrope may be used, some for fragrance merely 
and some for a part of the filling. 

Flavor the butter by cutting the desired quantity in 
small pieces, then lay it in thin cheese-cloth with the 
flowers all around it, and let it stand several hours in a 
close-covered jar. 

Spread the bread with the fragrant butter, and, if you 
like, sprinkle a few petals over the butter, then roll over 
and press firml3^ Put them back with the flowers and 
cover tightly, and when ready to serve arrange them in a 
dish. with fresh flowers. 



Sandwiches. 527 



Cucumber Sandwiches. — Select cucumbers that are 
small and thin, that there may be no large seeds. Peel 
and slice as thinly as possible, into ice water, and let 
them stand ten minutes. Drain very dr}', and place them 
between thin slices of bread which have been spread with 
maj^onnaise dressing. 

German Cucumber Sandwiches. — Peel the large cu- 
cumbers, cut in quartei-s lengthwise, and cut off the inside. 
Slice very thin, and let them stand in cold salted water 
until they are soft. Drain and press between towels to 
remove all the water. Butter thin rounds of brown 
bread, cover with a layer of the cucumber, season with a 
thick French dressing, and cover with another buttered 
round of bread. 

Cheese and Nut Sandwiches. — Take equal parts of 
grated cheese and English walnuts pounded to a meal, 
or ground; moisten with thick sv/eet cream, and season to 
taste with salt. Spread between thin slices of buttered 
bread. 

No. 2. — Chop fine or run through an almond grater 
half a cup of j^^cans. Melt half a cup of Edam cheese, 
and blend it thoroughly with the nuts. Add half a salt- 
spoon of paprika, and salt to taste. Spread the paste 
on thin slices of bread, and cut in small squares or 
triangles. 

Cherry Sandwiches. — Chop candied cherries fine, and 
moisten slightly with orange juice, or maraschino. 
Spread them on rounds of thin, lightly buttered bread, 
cover with another round, and serve on a dainty napkin. 

Crab-Apple Sandwiches. — Use whole-wheat bread, cut 
in one-third inch slices. Spread with a thin coating of 
thick cream, a little salt, and thin slivers of crab-apple 
jelly. Ser\^e these with lemonade. 



528 The Bostofi Cook Book. 

Ginger Sandwiches. — Bake a plain gingerbread in a 
thin sheet, or make soft cookies, and when cold cut into 
oblong pieces and split carefully. Spread with cream 
cheese, and put a thin slice of preserved ginger in the 
middle, cover, press slightly, and arrange on a napkin. 

Orange Marmalade Sandwiches. — Remove the crust 
from the end of a brick loaf of bread. Spread the end 
with creamed butter, and then cut off a thin even slice and 
repeat until you have sufficient 

Spread marmalade over the buttered side of one slice, 
being careful not to put it near the crust, lay another 
buttered slice on this, press them together with a broad 
knife, and trim off the crust. If the slices are large, 
divide them into triangles, or squares, or three long nar- 
row pieces. Or you may roll them and press slightl3\ 
Arrange them neatly in a fringed napkin, cover and serve 
as soon as possible. For a luncheon course you may use 
bread one day old, and toast it slightly before filling, and 
serve hot. 

Fig Sandwiches. — Use ripe figs that come in cans, or 
the delici(nis figs in cordial. Drain them from the S3Tup, 
then mash them to a paste, and spread on one part of 
the sandwich as directed for orange marmalade. 

Dates and Nuts. — Remove the stones and scales from 
the dates and break them up with a fork. Take half as 
much in bulk of pecans chopped fine or run through a 
nut-grater, mix them with the dates and moisten with 
creamed butter. Add a dash of salt^ and spread between 
two thin slices of bread. 

Mushroom Sandwiches. — A popular sandwich for 
afternoon tea consists of thin slices of enth-e-wheat bread, 
with a layer of cooked mushrooms between. The mush- 
rooms should be stewed until tender, and superfluous 
moisture allowed to evaporate, that the bread may not 
become soggy. 



Cherry Tarts. 529 



Deep Apple Pie. — Fill a deep earthen or granite dish 
with apples, pared, quartered, and cored. Sprinkle over 
them/iaZ/a cuj) of brown sugar mixed with one saltspoon- 
ful of allspice ; or you may use maple sugar, or half sugar 
and half molasses. Roll a strip of paste, one inch wide, 
wet the edge of the dish, put the paste on the edge, wet 
the rim of paste, then cover with a piece of paste a little 
larger than the dish, with the extra fulness thrown back 
into the centre. Press the cover to the rim, but not on 
the outer edge. Bake half an hour, or until the apples 
are soft. 

Cherry Tarts. — Into one cup of pastry flour mix one 
scant half teaspoon of salt. Add one-fourth cup of lard^ 
and chop it fine, using a knife instead of the fingers to 
avoid softening the lard, which should have been kept on 
the ice till quite hard. Mix with cold water to a stiff 
dough. Toss it out on a floured board, and pound it flat 
half an inch thick. Put on butter in little dabs here and 
there, dredge it slightly with flour, roll up and pat it out 
again. Do this four times, using one-fourth cup in all. 
After the last patting out, put it on ice until chilled. 
Use small tin cups or corn-cake tins to shape the tarts. 
Sprinkle them with flour on the outside, shake off all that 
does not adhere, then cover the outside with a thin layer 
of the paste. Roll the paste very thin, and cut with a 
saucer or cutter which will give you just the size to fit 
the tin. Put th? cups on a baking sheet and bake quickly. 
AVhen done, remove the tin by turning the cup over, and 
fill the crust with the prepared cherries. Wash, stem, and 
stone the cherries. Allow about one cup of sugar to one 
pint of cherries, if the very sour variety, possibly more 
will be needed. Put the sugar and one-half cup of water 
on the fire, and when boiling add the fruit, and cook ten 
minutes. Stir in one teaspoon of butter, and if the syrup 
seems thin, wet 07ie teaspoon of cornstarch in cold water, 
and stir in sufficient to thicken it slightly.

A Quick Dessert. — When an emergency arises where a 
dessert must be prepared q lickl}^, open a can of peaches, 
apricots, raspberries, or any avaiUible fruit. Put it in a 
rather large kettle with a close-fitting cover. While it is 
heating, mix one ^nnt of prepared Jlour with one beaten 
egg and one scant ctqyful of milk. Drop this like dump- 
lings in a stew over the fruit, cover closely, and steam 
from ten to fifteen minutes. Unless the fruit is juicy, 
there is danger that it will burn on the kettle while the 
dumplings are cooking. Serve the dumplings and fruit 
together with sugar and cream, or with a hard sauce. 

Noodles. {A German Dessert.) — Break tiuo eggs into 
a bowl, and stir in as much flour as they will take up in 
making a very stiff dough. Knead well. Roll out thin 
as a wafer, and roll up and cut off in thin strips. Let 
them boil in sweetened milk ten or fifteen minutes, or 
until done ; then skim them out. Rub ttvo tablesjjoons 
of butter to a cream ; add four yolks of eggs beaten ; 
then stir in the noodles and enough of the milk to make 
them moist. Add the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff. 

Put a layer of noodles in a baking dish, then a layer 
of any marmalade or jam, then another layer of each and 
another of noodles on top, and bake about twenty min- 
utes, or until brown. 

A friend who received her culinary education in Aus- 
tria recommends the following as being a most delicious 

Macaroon Pudding. — Take eight zwieback, remove the 
crusts and put them in melted butter to soften ; then let 
them cool. 

Put half a pound of macaroons^ using part butter and 
part suet^ into a bowl, and saturate them in claret icine 
thoroughly, or use syrup from whole peaches or 79??(ms, 
if you don't care for the wine. Remove the seeds from 
quarter of a pound of i^aisins^ and cut the same amount 
of citron in small thin slices. Mix one teasp>oon of cin- 
namon with one teaspoon of powdered sugar. 



I*uddi7igs. 531 



Butter a pudding mould, sprinkle with fine cracker or 
bread crumbs, and line it with the softened zwieback. 
Put in ala^^er of macaroons, then a layer of citron, spices, 
and raisins ; then another layer of macaroons and another 
of zwieback. Mix half a cup of cream with four to six 
beaten eggs, and pour this over the pudding. Add also 
the wine or syrup left from the macaroons. Steam it one 
hour, and serve with creamy sauce.

Scald half of the milk in a double boiler. Mix the 
sugar and flour, add the cold milk, and stir into the boil- 
ing milk. Cook five minutes, stirring until it thickens. 
Stir the butter in and when well mixed remove from the 
fire, and when nearly cold stir in the well-beaten yolks of 
the eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs until stiff and dry, 
and fold them in lightly. Turn into a buttered pudding 
dish, place the dish in a pan of hot water, and bake half 
an hour in a hot oven. Serve immediately. This is a 
delicious pudding and convenient to make, as the mate- 
rials are such as one w^ould usuall}'' have on hand, and the 
first part of the process may be done in the early part of 
the day, leaving nothing to be done at dinner time except 
to beat the whites of the eggs. Plan to put it into the 
oven just half an hour before it will be served, as it is 
better if it be served directly from the oven to the table. 
AVhen properly baked, it will not fall, and if any be left 
over it can be reheated for another meal, and will be 
good, even if not as nice as at first. Creamy sauce 
should be served with it. 

Cherry Rely Poly. — Into one pint of flour mix one- 
half teaspoon of salt and three level teas 00ns of baking-

Grandmother's Pound Cake. — For many 3'ears I tried 
in vain to make a pound cake that would have the soft, 
velvety texture which I remembered in that eaten at the 
table of a dear friend in my girlhood. The recipes which 
I tried made a fairly good cake, light and fine flavor, but 
the texture was never what I desired. 

Soon after my Boston Cook Book was completed a 
friend gave me her mother's recipe for pound cake, and 
it was as definite as most of the old style formulas. One 
and one-half teacups butter^ two blue cups sugar^ five un- 
beaten eggs^ added one at a time, and fi/ce handfuls of 
unsifted flour. Fortunately, my friend could show me 
by actual measurement just what she meant by handfuls 
of flour, and how she packed the butter in the teacup. 
The recipe then, as it stands, after a careful weighing 
and measurement by our standard half-pint cup, reads 
thus: One cup butter packed solid, orie and tico-thirds 
cups granulated sugar., one-half teaspoon mace., five un- 
beaten eggs^ tu'o cups sifted psistry flour. Have a round 
pan, greased and floured, the oven ready and ingredients 
measured, as the mixing must all be done by the hand. 
Cream the butter, add sugar, and work until very light, 
add spice and one egg at a time, and stir with the hand 
until you do not see any of the egg yolk, then another egg, 
and so on until all are used. Then mix in the flour, and 
turn at once into the pan, and bake slowly, about an hour. 

The grain of the cake should be fine and close, with not 
a suspicion of any toughness or heaviness, not porous 
like a cake made light with gas from soda and cream of 
tartar or by long beating, and yet soft, light, and velvety. 
This texture is obtained by the thorough blending of the 
butter and sugar, and not over beating the eggs.

part of the measure of flour. 

Mix the spice with one cup of the flour. 

Measure the butter easy, in pieces about like walnuts 
packed in lightly, cream it with the sugar, and beat into 
it the well-beaten yolks of eggs. 

Reserve one-fourth cup of milk to wet the soda. Warm 
the remainder of milk with the rum. 

Then add the spiced flour to the butter mixture, then 
a little of the milk, and beaten whites of eggs, then al- 
ternate flour, milk, and egg white, until all are used. Stir 
in the fruit before the last portion of flour is added, and, 
if stiff enough, do not use all the flour. Add the soda 
dissolved in the milk last. 

Bake in ' several small round pans, frost, and serve in 
the whole loaf, dividing it as needed. 

White Mountain Cake. — The distinguishing feature of 
this cake is that it has a soft frosting, or cream, instead 
of jelly, between the layers. This cream is sometimes 
flavored and enriched with chopped nuts, or fruits. The 
cake is baked in pans which are much deeper than jelly 
cake tins, and in most stores they are known as White 
Mountain cake pans.

Filling for White Mountain Cake. — Put half a cup boil- 
ing ivater and one cup granulated sugar in a smooth 
saucepan over the teakettle, and stir until sugar melts. 
Place it over the fire, and boil without stirring. Dip a 
silver fork in occasionally, and when the syrup forms a 
fine thread as the fork is withdrawn, it is done. Mean- 
while, have the ichltes of two eggs beaten stiff, and slowly 
pour the syrup onto it, beating as you pour. Beat until 
thick enough to spread easily, then flavor with tivo tea- 
spoons lemon jidce^ and spread it over the cake. Add 
half a cup of pineapple chopped and drained, or any fine 
French candied fruit, or raisins, figs, nuts, in any com- 
bination you please. Mix them with a part of the frost- 
ing for the middle layers, and save a few larger pieces 
of the fruit or nuts for the top, pressing them into the 
icing before it hardens.

aud flour (mixed with baking-powder, spice, and nuts), 
alternately. Measure baking-powder level. Bake half 
of it in a long cake pan and the remainder in two round 
pans. Frost the long loaf with caramel frosting and 
decorate with halved walnuts. Put caramel frosting on 
top of one of the round cakes, lay the other on this, press- 
ing it slightly, and pour the remainder of the frosting over 
the whole. 

Caramel 3 cups of C. C. sugar. | 1 cup cream. 
Frosting. 1 heaping tbsp. butter. 

Boil them in a granite saucepan without stirring, until 
when dropped in cold water it is hard enough to be waxy. 
Stir only on the bottom, to keep from burning. Then set 
the pan in cold water, as it hardens, spread it on the cake 
while it is still soft enough to spread. It will settle into 
a smooth surface almost instantly. 

Frosting. — One c?<p powdered sugar, one table spoonful 
cornstarch^ slightly rounding, two tablespoonfids water or 
7nilk, flavor as desired. Spread with a wet knife. 

This is simply mixed and requires no cooking. 

Sponge Cream Cake. {E. E. Squire.) — This recipe is 
desirable when one is limited for time. It may be made, 
baked, filled, and decorated in just twenty-five minutes. 

Two eggs and three-fourths of a cup of granidated sugar 
beaten together very light. Add five tablespoonfids of 
boiling water (be sure the water is boiling) as quickly as 
possible, beat slightly, then add one cup flour sifted twice 
with one teaspoonful bakuig powder and a saltspoonful of 
salt. Flavor slightly with lemon or ranUla or nutmeg.

Beat until the flour is absorbed, no longer. Bake in two 
jelly-cake pans twelve minutes in a quick oven. The 
batter is so thin the whole process of mixing can be done 
with the egg-beater. 

Whip one cup of cream stiff, sweeten with lyulverized 
sugar, adding it a spoonful at a time while you are beat- 
ing, until you have it sweet enough. Flavor to taste. 
Put part of it on the bottom of one cake, lay the other 
cake on with the top up, and put the remainder of the 
cream in a pastry bag containing a star tube in the end, 
and decorate the surface with dots of the cream.

Put it on back of cake, and if you like a thick loaf, lay 
one on top of the other. The peculiar flavor which is 
noticeable in many marshmallow cakes, especially those 
made by Germans, Js obtained from the extract of anise 
seed. Add it in small portions to the frosting till flavored 
to your liking ; a half teaspoonfal is usually sufficient. 

Marshmallow Cake, for dessert. {Miss Kate E. Whit- 
taker.) — Bake angel cake in a square pan, and when quite 
two days old, cut in slices and spread a marshmallow fill- 
ing between, ct la layer cake. Ice the top and sides wath 
a soft icing of a pale violet tint. Serve w^ith whipped 
cream around and candied violets scattered on the cake. 

Marshmallow Filling. — Put one ounce of granulated 
gum arabic with four tablespoons of cold ivater and soak 
it one hour. Then stir it over boiling water until melted. 
Strain it into a double boiler, add half a cup of sugar and 
cook thirty minutes. Then add the ichites of th7'ee eggs 
beaten very stiff and o/?e teaspoon of vanilla. Beat until 
the mixture is stiff and white.

of jelly, jam, or marmalade, with another dessert spoon- 
ful of the cake batter on the top. Bake in a quick oven

enough more flour to enable you to roll it very thin. Cut 
into rounds and bake quickly. Anise seeds are used by 
the Germans and the Chinese as a flavoring in cake and 
sweet dishes. They are the fruit of seed of a small an- 
nual of the parsley family. A cordial or liquor is also 
prepared from them. They have an aromatic, agreeable 
odor and a warm sweetish taste.

Then add flour to roll about a quarter of an inch thick, 
cut out in fancy shapes and bake quickly. 

Walnut Wafers. — Cream one-fourth of a cup (two 
ounces) of hutter gradually, add half a cuj) of poicdered 
sugar^ and almost drop by drop four tahlespoonfuls of 
milk. Next mix in a scant cupful of bread fiow\ a few 
drops of any flavoring extract preferred, and one-fourth of 
a cupful of chopped icalnuts. Spread on the bottom of an 
inverted dripping pan as thin as possible. The pan 
should be buttered unless it is very smooth. Because it 
is difficult to spread unless the nut meats are very finely 
chopped, many prefer to sprinkle them over the top of 
the dough after it is spread on tlie pan. Almond paste 
may be creamed in with the butter. 

Mark in squares, then sprinkle with the nuts, and bake 
in a moderate oven. In five minutes they should be ready 
to roll, and this must be done at the oven door before 
they have a chance to cool a particle. With a wafer iron 
the process is slower, but the shape can be made more 
uniform. 

Sand Cakes. — Cream one scant cup of butter with one cup 
and a half of light brown sugar. Beat two erjgs.^ reserving 
part of one white, and beat them into the butter. Mix 
half a teaspoon of cinnamon^ two level teaspoons oi baking- 
powder^ with three and a half cups of fiour^ stir this into 
the butter ; add another half cup of flour if needed to roll 
thin as a wafer. . Use fancy cutters, hearts, diamonds, 
etc. ; lay the cakes in a greased baking pan. Brush the 
top with the remaining egg white. Split blanched almonds 
and put three or four on each cake in corners or radiating 
from the centre. Mix one fourth of a teaspoon cinnamon 
with one-fourth of a cup coarse granulated sugar and 
sprinkle it over the cakes. Bake in a quick oven six or 
eight minutes.

Fancy Ice Creams. — Fancy ice creams depend largely 
for their right to this name, upon the moulding. Any 
good recipe for a cream ice or water ice may be used, 
but it is not advisable to attempt much in this line unless 
you have two freezers and a variety of fancy moulds. 
Plain briclv moulds, melon moulds, brown bread moulds, 
pails, baking-powder cans, or fruit cans, if they are water 
tight, may all be utilized. Individual fancy moulds are 
quite expensive, but if one can afford their first cost, and 
is likely to use them often, it is cheaper in the end than to 
depend upon the confectioner. 

Caf^ Parfait, No. 1. — Mix half a cup of strong clear 
coffee with one pint of medium cream. Sweeten to taste and 
stir until the sugar is dissolved. Place the bowl of cream 
in a pan of ice. When the cream is chilled, whip it with 
a whip-churn and skim off the froth into a strainer placed 
over a granite pan, which should be in another pan of ice 
to keep the whipped portion cold. Pack a mould in ice 
and salt, and when the whipped cream is drained, pack it 
into the mould. The liquid cream which drains through 
maybe whipped again. Be careful not to have any liquid 
cream in the mould. Cover the mould and let it stand in 
the ice from two to three hours. 

Cafe Parfait, No. 2. — Make half a cup clear strong coffee. 
Beat the yolks of three eggs, add half a saltspoon of salt 
and half a cup of sugar, and when well mixed stir it into 
the coffee and cook in a double boiler till thick and 
smooth, stirring constantly. Strain, and when cold add 
one quart of cream, whipped. Beat until well blended, and 
add more sugar if needed. Turn into the freezer can, 
packed in ice and salt, and freeze without turning the 
crank. 

Line a melon mould with an inch-thick layer of vanilla 
or plain coffee ice cream, then fill the centre with the 
whipped cream as in No. 1, and cover with ice cream. 
Pack in ice and salt, and let it stand for three hours. 



Fruit Mousse, 547 



Cafe Pralines. — Beat yolks ot four eggs^ Siddfour table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and four table spoonfuls of hlack coffee. 
Cook in double boiler until thick and creamy, stirring 
constantly. Then turn it out and beat until it is cold. 
Add four tahle spoonfuls of praline poicder, and fold in 
lightly the drained whip from one pint of cream. Turn 
into a mould, and pack in ice and salt, and let it stand 
four hours. 

Praline powder is made by powdering fine peanut, 
almond, or any nut candy which has been boiled in sugar 
until brown. 

Fruit Mousse. — Sprinkle strawberries or raspberries 
with sugar ^ and let them stand until the sugar is dis- 
solved and the juice drawn out. Use enough berries to 
make a pint of juice. Mash them and strain through 
fine cheese-cloth. Or prepare a pint of pineapple or 
orange juice, and sweeten to taste. Soak a quarter of a 
box of Nelsorts gelatine in a quarter of a cup of cold water 
twenty minutes. Pack the mould or freezer can, minus the 
beaters, in ice and salt. Chill a pint of cream; then whip 
and drain it, as directed in Cafe Parfait, No. 1. Dissolve 
the soaked gelatine in a quarter of a cup of boiling water ^ 
and strain it into the fruit juice. Set the pan in a pan 
of ice and stir constantly, and as it begins to thicken stir 
in the whipped cream. When well mixed, pour it into 
the mould. Cover, and let it stand three hours in broken 
ice and salt, that it may become icy cold. Whip the 
cream with a syllabub churn, skim off the froth and put 
it into the strainer. If any liquid part drain through into 
the pan, put it back into the bowl and whip again. When 
all is whipped, put it into the mould or can. Pack it in 
closely enough to fill all the spaces, but be careful not to 
break up the froth. Cover the mould and let it stand 
three or four hours. When a fluted or fancy mould is 
used, the mousse will turn out better if the mould is first 
lined with ice cream or sherbet frozen just stiff enough to 
pack in smoothly. 



548 The Boston Cook Book. 

Frapp^. — Frappe is a term given to water ices which 
have been only partly frozen ; that is, to the consistency of 
mush, rather than hard enough to mould. It is really an 
iced drink, therefore the name should not be given to a 
thick custard cream. These ices are served in glasses, and 
usually are more or less liquid as the mixture melts very 
quickly. They may be made of any fruit juice diluted 
with water and sweetened, or with a mixture of juices, or* 
with tea, coffee, or clam juice. They are served at after- 
noon teas, evening entertainments, or before the game 
course at dinner. 

In freezing frappe we use equal parts of ice and salt, 
and freeze quickly, as we wish to have a granular texture, 
and we turn the crank only until the mixture is partly 
frozen; or it may be left in the can without stirring and 
when partly frozen, by scraping the icy portions from the 
side of the can, and a slight mixing, the desired consist- 
ency may be obtained. 

Caf^ Frapp^. — Make a quart of very strong black cof- 
fee^ and mix it with a quart of cream, and sweeten to 
taste. Freeze as directed. 

Caf^ Frapp^. — Make a quart of coffee by filtering one 
quart of hoiling icater through half a cup of fine coffee. 
Freeze as directed, and serve in glasses with a spooyiful 
ot sweetened luhipped cream on each glass. 

Grape Juice Frappd. — One pint of grape juice, one 
pint of ivaier, one and one half cups of sugar. Freeze as 
directed. 

Strawberry Frapp^. — The juice from one quart of 
strawberries and tivice the amount of icater, one table- 
spoonful of lemon juice and sugar to make it very sweet, 
about half a cup for aptint of liquid. 

Clam Frapp^. — Two quarts of clams in the shell. 
Wash and scrub the clams, rinse thoroughly. Put half a 



Sherbet. 549 



cup of icater in a kettle, add the clams, cover tightly, 
and cook until the shells open. Skim out the clams, and 
pour off the water; remove the shells and tough mem- 
brane. Put the clams into the water, and let them stand 
ten minutes. Then skim them out, let the water settle, 
then strain through fine cheese-cloth, and freeze as 
directed. 



Ceylon 1 pt. sugar boiled with 
Frapp^. 1 pt. water, add 

2 cups orange juice. 



1 can grated pineapple. 
1.2 cup lemon juice. 
1 cup Cevlon tea 



Pour the boiling syrup over the shaved rind of half an 
orange and half a lemon, add the fruit juice. Pour one 
cup of boiling water on one teaspoonful of choice tea. 

When cool, strain, mix, and freeze as directed. 

Cherry Frappe. — The juice from one quart can of v'liite 
cherries^ a pint bottle of Apollinaris, and sugar to taste. 
Strain and freeze as directed. 

Orange Frapp^. — Boil tico cups of sugar and two cups 
of water twenty minutes, add the grated rind of one 
orange^ and pour it over two cups of blood orange juice 
add the juice of one lemon; strain, cool, and freeze as 
directed. 

Roman 1 cup lemon juice. 1 pint champagne. 

Punch. 4 cups water. 1 gill maraschino. 

2 cups sugar. 

Put water, lemon juice, and sugar together, freeze to 
a mush ; then add champagne and maraschino and finish 
freezing. Serve in frappe glasses. 

Banana Sherbet. — Put three cups of water ^n({ one and 
one-half cups of sugar in a smooth saucepan, and boil 
five minutes. Add the juice of one lemon and two oranges, 
and a little of the grated rind of each, and one cup of 
sifted banana pulp. Scrape off all the stringy fibres 



^^o The Boston Cook Booh. 

from the bananas before sifting. Beat the syrup and 
fruit mixture till cold, then stir in three cujjs of whipped 
cream, measured after whipping, or the whites of thixe 
eggs beaten stiff, if you have no cream. Add half a cup of 
sherry, if you approve, but it is delicious without it, as 
the banana has a distinctive flavor. Freeze till soft like 
mush, using equal parts of ice and salt. Serve in frappe 
glasses. 



4 oz. candied ginger. 
1 qt. sugar. 



Lemon 2 qts. boiling water. 
Ginger 8 lemons. 
Sherbet. 1 egg, white. 

Spread part of the sugar on a shallow plate or board, 
and after wiping the lemons with a clean, damp cloth, 
roll them in the sugar, to extract the oil. Then cut in 
halves, remove the seeds, and squeeze out the juice. 
Boil all the sugar, ginger, and water until clear. Remove 
the scum as it rises. Add the lemon juice to the syrup, 
strain it, and pour it gradually into the beaten egg. 
Then freeze as usual. 

"White Velvet Sherbet. — The juice of six lemons and 
the thinly shaved peel of two soaked in the juice half an 
hour. Then strain the juice, and add enough sugar to 
make a thick batter. It usually requires about a cupful 
to each lemon. Add three joints of viilk, and turn at 
once into a freezer packed with three parts broken ice and 
one part rock salt. Turn slowly at first, and when it 
begins to thicken, turn rapidly until stiff. Add more 
ice and salt, and let it ripen for at least two hours before 
serving. 

Milk Sherbet. — Pour one quart of milk into the freezer 
can, and pack it in the freezer with salt and ice. With 
the juice of three ov four lemons mix a generous cupful of 
sugar or enough to make a thick batter. A more pro- 
nounced lemon flavor is gained by using a few drops of 
lemon extract, or rubbing the rind of the lemons with 



Sultana Roll. 551 



lumps of loaf sugar which are afterward dissolved in the 
juice. Mix the lemon syrup with the ice-cold milk, and 
freeze as usual. When the milk is very cold, there is 
little danger that it will curdle. 

Ice Cream -with Fruit Syrup. — Fill punch glasses 
half full with vanilla ice cream. Crush strawberries 
and sweeten to taste with sugar dissolved in a little 
water boiled and cooled. Pour the fruit over the ice 
cream, nearly filling the glass. 

Banana Ice Cream. — Select eight large nice bananas^ 
ripe, but free from all blemish on the skin. Wipe them, 
and carefully peel off the flat strip of skin. Remove the 
pulp, scrape out the fibrous portion from the skins, and 
put them in the ice chest until the cream is ready. Mash 
the pulp of half of the bananas, mix with it two cups of 
sugar and one quart of cream of medium thickness, add 
one saltspoon of salt^ and two of lemon juice. Press it 
through a fine sieve and freeze. Chop fine some French 
candied fruity cherries^ green plums, and angelica enough 
to make eight rounded tablespoonfuls . When the cream 
is nearly frozen, put a layer of it in the banana skins, 
sprinkle a tablespoonful of the fruit over the cream, add 
enough more cream to fill the skins, lay back the strip, 
and tie them with narrow green ribbons. Put them into 
a clean freezer, and let them stand surrounded with ice 
and salt, for an hour or two to ripen. Serve them on 
plates lined with lace paper. 

Sultana Roll. — Wash and sosik on e-fotirth of a cup 
of Sultanas in brandy or ivi7ie to cover. Mix 07ie scant 
tablespoon of flour and a speck of salt with one cup of 
sugar ; add one egg^ and beat well. Pour on slowly one 
pint of hot milk. Turn into the double boiler, and cook 
twenty minutes. Cool and stir in one quart of cream ^ a 
feiv drojjs of (dnio7id and a tablespoon of vanilla. Color 
a delicate green with green color paste. Freeze it, and

then use it to line baking-powder cans, pound size. Scat- 
ter the drained Sultanas through the cream, fill the centre 
with thick creain^ sweetened, flavored with vanilla and 
whipped stifif. Cover, and let the cans stand in ice and 
salt one or two hours. Turn out, cut in slices, and serve 
with 

Claret Sauce. — Boil one cup of sugar with one- fourth 
of a cup of ivater ; when slightly thickened, cool and add 
one-half of a cup) of claret. 



Frozen 1 quart milk. 

Pudding. 1 hpd. tbsp. arrowroot. 
{E. E. Squire.) 2 cups sugar. 

% level tsp. salt. 

3 cups cream. 



4 eggs, whites. 

1 tbsp. vanilla. 

% lb. French fruit. 

2 oz. pistachio nuts. 
Color and flavor to taste. 



Scald the milk in a double boiler. Mix the arrowroot, 
sugar, and salt thoroughly, turn them into the boiling milk 
and stir constantly until it thickens and is smooth. Cook 
for twenty minutes. Or if you prefer you may wet the 
arrowroot with a little cold milk and stir it, into the boil- 
ing milk and then add the sugar. 

Let this mixture become very cold, and when ready to 
freeze it, whip the cream to a light froth, beat the eggs 
until light, but not stiff, and stir them into the cold mix- 
ture. Should there be any doubt as to the sweetness of 
the cream, scald and cool it, before whipping. Add the 
vanilla, using enough to give a strong flavor. If you like, 
you may color it a delicate tint with yellow, pink, or green 
color paste. 

Turn it into the freezer and when partly frozen stir in 
the French fruit and nuts. The fruit should be cut into 
small bits. Candied cherries, apricots, and green plums 
make an agreeable combination. Blanch the nuts in 
boiling water until the skins loosen easily, remove them, 
and cut into thin slices. 

Frozen pudding as usually served at first-class hotels 
is flavored with a fine quality of Santa Cruz or Jamaica 



Green Apple Sauce. 553 

Rum, about two tablespoonfuls put in with the fruit. 
Those who approve of and are accustomed to this flavor 
would doubtless consider a frozen pudding made without 
it, as not worthy of the name, but when made after this 
recipe it is delicious with only the vanilla flavoring, and 
although more expensive than the usual formula, it is 
well worth an occasional trial. 

Strawberry Ice Cream. — Sprinkle two cups of sugar 
over two quarts of strawberries. Mash them, and let 
them stand half an hour, or until the sugar is dissolved ; 
and meanwhile prepare the ice, and pack the freezer. 
Turn the berries into a large square of cheese-cloth, 
placed over a bowl, and squeeze as long as any juice or 
pulp will come. Then empty the pulp and seeds left in 
the cloth into a pan, and pour on gradually about a pint 
of milk ; mix it well with the pulp, until the pulp is sep- 
arated from the seeds. Squeeze again until perfectly 
dry. There should be nothing left in the cloth save a 
ball of seeds. Add to the juice as much cream as you 
may have, from one cup to three pints, and sugar to 
make it very sweet. Freeze as usual. After tasting 
this, you will never want any other strawberry ice 
cream. 

Stewed Green Apple Sauce. — The first green apples 
that are found in the market usually awaken an appetite 
for apple sauce and apple pie. The former is seldom 
seen in perfection. Try this method. 

With a sharp silver knife cut the apples in quarters, 
remove the cores and skin and put them, as fast as pared, 
into a bowl of cold water. When all are ready, skim them 
out into a porcelain-lined or agate kettle with a large 
surface, so there will not be much depth to the apples. 
Add boiling water, just to show among the pieces, cover 
tightly to keep in the steam, and let them cook quickly. 
Shake the pan occasionally, and as soon as soft, mash 
them with a silver fork, sprinkle over sugar to taste, 



554 The Boston Cook Booh. 

cover again and cook until the sugar is dissolved, and 
serve hot or cold. It should be free from lumps, white 
or about the shade of the iuside of a lemon, and not too 
sweet. When eaten hot for breakfast, sometimes a pat 
of butter is an improvement. When cooked in this care- 
ful way, it will be far more appetizing than if of a dingy- 
brown color, of half cooked, and there will be no occasion 
for sifting it. 

Bananas with Fruit Sauce. — Pick over one quart of 
currants; wash, drain, and mash them. Sprinkle over 
them one cup of siLgar^ and let them stand until the sugar 
is dissolved. Stir occasionally, then squeeze through 
coarse cheese-cloth, or press through a strainer fine 
enough to keep back the seeds. Peel four bananas^ re- 
move all the stringy membranes, cut them in halves 
lengthwise and crosswise. Arrange them in a shallow 
glass dish, and pour the currant juice over them. Keep 
it in a cold place until ready to serve. The flavor of the 
currant juice improves the bananas, and the color gives 
a pretty effect. Do not use the currants without sifting, 
for the seeds will be quite objectionable in the sauce. 
Blackberry juice may be used in the same way. A cool, 
simple dessert like this is more acceptable on a summer 
day than a hot starchy pudding served with meringue or 
whipped cream. 

Stewed Prunes. — It would appear that so simple a 
thing as a dish of stewed prunes might always be accept- 
ably served, but they are usually too sweet or insutiici- 
eutly cooked. All dried fruits — that is, fruits that have 
been deprived of their natural juices by quick evapora- 
tion, or sun drying — need to have this juice or water 
replaced by a long soaking in cool water before being 
subjected to heat. This softens the cellular tissues so 
that they can absorb the water, the fruit swells out to 
nearly its natural condition ; and then by the lieat ap- 
plied in cooking, the softening process is continued until 
every particle of the skin is, or should be, perfectly soft. 



Preserved Strawberries. 555 

Just enough water to cover them, so that all may be 
equally softened, is all that is necessary, and when the 
prunes are sufficiently cooked this should boil down to a 
thick syrup. Except in some of the most acid varieties, 
no sugar is needed. In fact, many prunes are so rich in 
sugar that a little lemon juice seems to be an improve- 
ment. It is understood, of course, that the prunes should 
be well washed in tepid water before they are soaked. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Select the choicest berries 
and lay aside not necessarily very large ones, but per- 
fect, firm, and of even size they must be. Press the re- 
mainder of the fruit for juice, taking only what drips 
easily. These berries can be used later for a jam. 

To a pound of juice allow a pound of sugar, and make 
as one does any jelly. Boil fully twenty minutes until 
surely jellied. Meantime weigh the fruit selected and an 
equal amount of sugar. Add these then to the jelly and 
boil carefully a few minutes more. No exact time can be 
given. It would not keep with raw strawberries dropped 
in, neither must they be allowed to shrivel like preserved 
ones. Occasionally try it on a saucer, keeping the kettle 
at a simmer only. Do not do much at a time. It is bet- 
ter to repeat the operation. When it grows firm in the 
saucer, put in a cold place, remove it from the fire (and 
seal, as usual, when cold), dipping it with care into glasses 
soon after taking from the fire. 

It will not be a jelly that moulds like gooseberry or like 
quince and sustains its weight. It is apt to fall in lusci- 
ous masses, catching the light in its clear red depths and 
showing the imprisoned berries. 

A very little apple juice prepared as for jelly — and 
carefully strained — added at the beginning, with the 
same allowance of sugar, pound for pound or fractions 
thereof, would help it to form or "set" as old house- 
keepers say, and the flavor would not be detected. This 
is frequently done for making pear, cherry, and peach 
jellies, for the same reason that they do not form jelly

well alone. A flannel jelly bag is very nice for a second 
straining, using the usual linen cheese-cloth for the first 
pressing. Cincinnati Recipe. 

Pot-Pourri. — Put a 2>int of alcohol or tvhite preserving 
brandy into a large stone jar that has a tightly fitting 
cover ; then, as the summer fruits come on, put them 
into the alcohol with an equal amount of sugar; thus a 
cup of sugar and a cup of fruit. Stir every day with a 
clean wooden spoon. Use strawberries, pineapples, rasp- 
berries, currants, blackberries, apricots, cherries, peaches, 
plums, and grapes. Plums and peaches should be peeled, 
stoned, and cut fine. Cherries should be stoned, and 
grapes should be seeded. The alcohol is enough for the 
jarful of fruit, and will cook and keep the fruit perfectly. 
About a month after putting in the last fruit, it will be 
ready to use. 

As the seeds of small fruits become hard by the brandy, 
it is better to mash them and use only the juice, particu- 
larly with currants, blackberries, and raspberries. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — September, or not earlier than the 
middle of August, is the best time to make rhubarb jelly, 
as it is almost impossible for it to thicken when made of 
the spring rhubarb. 

Wash the rhubarb, but do not peel it, simply cut it into 
small pieces and never mind if it be stringy. To every 
pound of rhubarb add half a cup of ivater and let it stew 
slowly in a granite or porcelain pan until it is all in 
shreds. Then strain through a fine cloth. Measure the 
juice and allow one pomid of sugar to one pint of juice. 
Let the juice simmer ten minutes, or until it begins to 
thicken on the edge, then add the sugar and let it simmer 
till it jellies on the spoon or when dropped on a cool 
plate. Remove the scum carefully when done, turn into 
glasses which have been rolled in hot water and are still 
standing in it, and when cold and firm, pour melted par- 
affine over the top. Cover with paper and keep in a cool, 
dark closet. 



Preserved Citron. 557 

"Wild Unripe Grape Sauce. — Wash the grapes and re- 
move the stems. Cut through the middle with a sharp knife 
and remove the seeds. Then weigh the fruit and allow 
an equal weight of sugar. Put the cut fruit in a kettle 
with cold water to show just to the top of the fruit. Let 
it boil, remove the scum, then sprmkle over it one quarter 
of the sugar. Boil again and press the grapes down, but 
do not stir to break them. Then add another quarter of 
the sugar, and when it has boiled five or eight muiutes, 
repeat until all the sugar is used. Cook slowly until the 
syrup is thick or will jelly. Turn into small jars or 
glasses and seal with paper. When cold, the grapes 
should be quite distinct in the clear jelly. 

Grape Jelly. — The wild grapes, gathered just as they 
begin to turn, are the best for jelly. Cultivated grapes, 
if fully ripe, are quite likely to disappoint one, if used 
for jelly ; the color is dark and unattractive, and the com- 
pound is often a syrup rather than a jelly, but they make 
delicious marmalade. 

Wash the grapes and free them from the stems. Put 
them in the kettle, and mash them until all broken. Heat 
slowh', and cook until the juice is well drawn out. Then 
place a square of cheese-cloth over a colander, and set 
the colander over a bowl. Turn in the grapes, and let it 
drip without any pressure. Measure the juice, and allow 
an equal measure of sugar. If wild grapes are used, 
allow a little more than an equal portion of sugar. Boil 
the juice fifteen minutes. Skim, and strain again, then 
add the sugar, and boil until the surface looks wrinkled, 
and the liquid jellies on the edge. Skim well, and turn 
into glasses. 

Preserved Citron. — Cut the citron melon In halves each 
way, then cut each quarter in three-quarter-inch slices 
from the stem and blossom ends to the middle. In this 
way you cut across the seeds, and they can be more easily 
removed than if the melon be cut in the same direction 
that the seeds lie. 



558 The Boston Cook Booh. 

Pick out all the seeds, and cut the slices in squares, 
stars, triangles, or any shape preferred. Put the harder 
outside pieces by themselves. Weigh the fruit aud allow 
an equal weight of sugar or a little less if you prefer. 
Cook the citron in clear water until tender and transpar- 
ent, the harder pieces first. As the fruit softens, take it 
out into another kettle or deep dish and sprinkle each 
layer with sugar. When it is all cooked, let it stand until 
the sugar is nearly dissolved and some of the citron juice 
is drawn out. Then put it over the fire again, aud let it 
heat slowly until the fruit is heated through. Remove 
the fruit into the jars, which should be near at hand, in 
a pan of hot water. Boil the syrup down until it seems 
thick and rich, then pour it into the jars and seal quickly. 
If the fruit seems dry after standing in the sugar, you 
may add a little water when it is put on to boil. If you 
like, you may use the thinly shaved rind and juice of one 
lemon to each jar of fruit. Be sure that the lemon is not 
bitter. One tablespoonful of crystallized ginger cut fine 
gives a flavor preferred by many. 

Strawberry Tomato Preserve. — For one pound of 
strawberry tomatoes allow one-half 2^ound of sugar aud 
one lemon. 

Remove the husks. Make a syrup with the sugar and 
water enough to dissolve it, bring it to a boil and remove 
the scum. Add the tomatoes and let them stew until 
heated through, then skim them out and boil the syrup 
down until quite thick. Cook the sliced lemon in boil- 
ing water until the rind is tender, then add it to the 
syrup. 

Tutti Frutti for Tarts. — Take equal parts of stoned 
cherries, currants, red raspberries, and large gooseberries. 
Mash the currants, squeeze out the juice, and use that to 
dissolve the sugar. Allow one pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit. Mix and boil until thick like jam. De- 
licious for tarts 



Mangoes. 559 



Lemon Butter. — The juice and grated rind of three 
lemons^ three eggs well beaten, one pound of sugar, one 
small cup of ivater, one level teaspoonful of butter. Beat 
well together and boil five minutes or until thick. Keep 
it in covered jelly-glasses. This is an English recipe. 

Mangoes. — These are made from small, green water or 
muskmelons, green tomatoes, peppers, peaches, large cu- 
cumbers, or any fruit from which the seeds, stone, or 
inside portion can be removed, the cavity filled with a 
highly-seasoned mixture, and the opening closed again in 
such a way as to give the appearance of whole fruit. In 
using peppers and green tomatoes, cut a circular piece 
from the stem end, remove the seeds, and put the pieces 
in place again, or beside the one from which they were 
taken. If melons are used, cut out a piece one inch wide 
and three long, then scoop out the seeds and soft portion. 
When the fruit is prepared, let it soak over night in 
strongly-salted water. In the morning drain, and be 
careful to have the cut portions kept where they belong. 
Prepare the following mixture to use as stuffing : Chop 
enough firm, white cahhage to fill the cavities, it is im- 
possible to give the exact amount. You may use with it, 
if you prefer, one-fourth part of chopped celery, or green 
tomatoes, or cucumbers. Sprinkle well with salt and let 
it stand two hours. Allow 07ie small onion, two or three 
nasturtium-seeds , and half a teaspoonful of ichole mus- 
tai^d-seed to each pint of chopped vegetables. Season to 
taste with ground cloves, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, pep- 
'per, and salt. Mix thoroughly, and then fill the cavities ; 
press it in well, fit in the pieces that were removed, and 
then tie them firmly with fine twine. Put the mangoes in 
a preserving kettle, cover with cold vinegar and let them 
remain over night. The next morning heat all together 
and simmer gently half an hour. Take them out care- 
fully and put in a stone jar and cover with cold vinegar. 
The next morning pour off the vinegar, add half a cup of 
sugar to each quart of vinegar, bring to a boil, and pour 



560 The Boston Cook Booh. 

it over the maDgoes. Repeat this for three or four morn- 
ings, and after the last scalding, cover when cool, and 
put away in a dry place. The latter part of this process 
applies only to mangoes made from melons and cucum- 
bers. Pepper and tomato mangoes are simply covered 
with cold vinegar after stuffing, then put away, and in a 
month they will be ready for the table. 

Orange Marmalade. — One dozen of large navel oranges. 
Cut in halves, and scoop out the juice. Boil the peels 
two or three hours in plenty of water until you can run a 
broom corn through them. Drain, and when cool enough 
to handle, scrape out all the white, leaving only the yellow 
outside. Cut into straws. Weigh the pulp free from 
membrane and add an equal weight of sugar. Boil pulp, 
sugar, and straws for two hours, and then turn into glasses. 
It makes six one-pint jelly tumblers.

IMPROVED WHITE 

MOUNTAIN FREEZER 




USED BY MRS. LINCOLN 

Endorsed and recommended by the Boston Cooking 
School, and used there in preference to all other freezers 

ALL White Mountain Freezers have several distinctive features 
of superior excellence, which especially contribute to their 
marked success, and which are not found in imitating freezers. 

They are all triple action. 

They will, in four minutes, freeze to uniform hardness cream 
of even grain and perfect smoothness. 

The tubs are built very strong, and will not warp, leak, or crack, 
and the cans are made of the finest quality pure charcoal tin plate. 

The beaters and interior mechanism are plated with block tin, 
and the exterior metal parts are cast iron, finely galvanized to pre- 
vent rusting. 

They are the only freezers made with a malleable iron duplex dasher 
and double self-adjusting scrapers, which, by keeping every particle of 
cream in constant motion, causes it to freeze faster and more evenly 
than can possibly be accomplished by any other freezer. 

White Mountain Freezers work quickly, wear perfectly, and 
are in every part so designed and constructed as to make them 
models of efficiency and durability.

Carving and serving 

By Mrs. MARY J. LINCOLN, 

AUTHOR OF " THE BOSTON COOK BOOK." 

Square i2mo. Illuminated board covers. Price, 60 cents. 



"Carving and Serving," by Mrs. D. A. Lincoln, author of the "Boston Cook 
Book," is a little manual by the aid of which any gentleman or lady can become ar. 
expert carver. Wliat an advantage it must be to be able to place with the left hands 
fork in the breast of a turkey, and, without once removing it, with the right hand to 
carve and dissect, or disjoint, the entire fowl ready to be helped to admiring guests' 
This is done by skilful carvers. The book also contains directions for serving, withi-- 
list of utensils for carving and serving. 

" The student of this attractive little book has no excuse for inefficiency and bun 
gling, as the directions, both general and specific, are so clear that no room is left fca 
uncertainty. The scope of the book broadens somewhat beyond its expressed range 
in giving a word of needful advice to the guest, who is conjured to bear in mind that 
he is invited to dine, not to take a lesson in carving ; adding that there * seems to be 
an irresistible fascination about carving which silences all tongues, and draws all eyes 
to the head of the table.' However, if the process is performed a la Mrs. Lincoln, 
scrutiny need not be feared. The directions in serving are no less timely and valuable, 
being founded upon a combination of experience and good taste that may safely be 
regarded as oracular." — Cottmtottwealth. 

"'Carving and Serving,' by Mrs. D. A. Lincoln, is a capital book for housekeepers. 
It gives minute and clear directions how to carve everything that goes on to the table 
in the way of beef, poultry, and game. It also gives instructions how to prepare all 
these edibles, and appetizing dishes like sweetbreads, chops, cutlets, meat pies, salads, 
soups, and many others. And what is greatly essential, it gives detailed information 
how to serve the different edibles and drinks, to cut bread, and, last but not least, 
gives some very much-needed advice how to offer all these things at the table. . . . 
The book is full of such pretty suggestions, as well as solid information, and there is 
such a wide-spread interest to-day among educated women regarding cooking, serving, 
and managing dishes on the table, they will find this little book a valuable assistant ir-' 
sm £uch matters." — Hartford Times.

By MRS. MARY J. LINCOLN 

AUTHOR OF *<THE BOSTON COOK BOOK" 

One Volume. i2mo. Price, $i.oo 

I regard the book as a very practical one for a text-book. It will be 
especially valuable to the teacher as a guide to the lessons she gives. The 
physiological information and chemical analysis of foods, together with the 
tables of cost at the end of the book, add to the usefulness of the work. It is 
an undoubted success for the school-room. — William T. Harris, Concord, 
Mass. 

Your " Boston School Kitchen Text-Book " appears to be based on cor- 
rect principles and admirably executed as regards details. I hope that my girls 
will have a chance to practically study its interesting lessons. Your quiet 
assumption (which runs through the whole book) that there is a good and 
satisfactory reason behind every process which is endorsed by good usage, is a 
wholesome one which it is well that children should early learn. — C. M. 
Woodward, Manual Training School, IVashiugton University, St. Louis, 
Mo. 

Allow me to say that you have made our whole country your debtor by the 
composition of a book so much needed, and so simple, sensible, and thorough. 
I am sure the book is its own best plea for a place in our public schools. I 
believe it will greatly aid in making instruction in the theory and practice of 
cookery a part of our school courses. — George C. Chase, Professor of 
English Literature, Bates College, Lewiston, Me.

A SELECTION FROM SOME OF THE MANY NOTICES BY THE PRESS. 

" Mrs. Lincoln, nothing daunted by the legion of cook-books already in existence, 
thinks there is room for one more. Her handsome and serviceable-looking volume 
seems to contain everything essential to a complete understanding of the culinary art. 
The Introduction of thirty-five pages discusses such subjects as cooking in general, 
fire, fuel, management of a stove, the various processes of boiling, stewing, baking, 
frying, roasting, and broiling, with full explanation of the chemical theory underlying 
each and distinguishing them ; also hints on measuring and mixing, with tables of 
weights, measures, and proportions ; of time in cooking various articles, and of 
average cost of material. One who can learn nothing from this very instructive 
Introduction must be well-informed indeed. Following this comes an elaborate and 
exhaustive chapter on bread-making in all its steps and phases. To this important 
topic some seventy pages are devoted. And so on through the whole range of viands. 
Exactness, plainness, thoroughness, seem to characterize all the author's teachings. 
No point is neglected, and directions are given for both necessary and luxurious 
dishes. There are chapters on cooking for invalids, the dining-room, care of kitchen 
utensils, etc. There is also a valuable outline of study for teachers taking up rhe 
chemical properties of food^ and the physiological functions of digestion, absorption, 
nutrition, etc. Add the miscellaneous questions for examination, the topics and 
illustrations f^r lectures on cookery, list of utensils needed in a cooking-school, an 
explanation of foreign terms used in cookery, a classified and an alphabetical index, 
— and you have what must be considered as complete a work of its kind as has yef 
appeared." — Mirror, Springfield, III.
