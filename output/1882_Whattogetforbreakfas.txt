PREFACE. 



The ivriter sends this Breakfast Repertory on 
its mission with the earnest hope that it may aid 
housekeepers in answering that oft-repeated ques- 
tion — 

What shall we have for Breakfast? 

Every little while the good housekeeper gets 
into inextricable difficulties with this vexed ques- 
tion, and what to get for this meal seems to em- 
barrass her more than to arrange for two or three 
dinners. Knowing that this general complaint of 
breakfast difficulties exists, the writer hopes to 
succeed in producing a directory that will help 
these perplexities of the most important meal of 
the day, and suggest over one hundred practical 
breakfast bills of fare, adapted to various persons 
and circumstances. 



10 PREFACE. 



To the young housekeeper who has entered upon 
her new duties without experience ; to those whose 
breakfasts are stereotyped after one fashion, and 
of which they heartily tire, these suggestions may 
prove of service. I have endeavored to make 
ea.eh plan so phiin that a novice can work with 
certainty/ of success. 

Besides furnishnig this extensive collection of 
breakfast fares, the wriLC^' aims to convince house- 
keepers of the evil eftects of neglecting this meal ; 
also, of the benefits resulting from a warm and 
nuti'itious breakfast. 

Each breakfast I have endeavored to suggest on 
common-sense principles ; have made nourishment 
the chief aim of eating ; have avoided provoking 
the appetite beyond nature ; have ignored nothing 
but what is absolutely unfriendly to health, and 
have advised each fare in a practical manner, so 
that the stomach may not be offended. 

I have aimed to inspire a respect for made-over 
dishes, which are sometimes so convenient for this 
meal, but which are served by many housekeepers 
in such an indifferent manner that the stomach 
takes offence, but which by patience and skill can 
be made appetizing. 



PREFACE. 11 



M}^ motto will be, never to attempt too much, 
but ever bear in mind that it is not the multiplicity 
of dishes, but the excellent and life-giving* qualities 
of a breakfast that vitally concern a family ; that 
a few wholesome and well-cooked dishes are more 
satisfying, and preferable to many indifterently 
cooked. 

Only home-made food will be patronized, as it is 
of vital importance that evpry :;rticle of food in- 
troduced at the table should be pure ; and to avoid 
hurtful admixtures, a personal inspection of its 
preparation is important, else we know not what 
we eat in this age of adulteration. 

A rigid adherence to the combination of each 
fare is not urged, but to deviate as circumstances 
dictate, and from each one to contrive and invent 
for yourselves as convenience requires, yet making- 
it a matter of study to serve together dishes which 
are especially suited to each other. Be assured 
you will derive much benefit from the experience 
of combining and contriving for j^ourselves. 

To have your favorite breakfasts in memoran- 
dum is sometimes a great convenience in cases of 
absence, sickness, or otherwise. For recording 
them each division is interleaved. 



12 PREFACE. 



No directory for the morning meal has yet been 
published, so far as the writer has yet been a]>le 
to investigate, consequently she trusts this offer- 
ing will be gladly received. 



SECTION I. 



WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST, 



I. REASONS FOR A GOOD BREAKFAST. 

I OFFER the opinion of an experienced and suc- 
cessful plijsician, whose protection I shared at an 
early age, and by whom I was scrupulously re- 
stricted from early morning walks, before break- 
fast, — a custom then among juveniles, it being the 
prevailing opinion that the early morning air was 
the healthiest, most bracing, and purest. He did 
not agree with the boarding-school theory which 
prescribed long walks before breakfast as a means 
of promotino- health, — but ever arirued the con- 
trary as the ftict, — that languor and exhaustion 
were sure to follow such exercise, especially when 
taken by persons of delicate organization or those 
liable to sudden colds. Assured that many con- 
sumptions and other diseases were contracted from 
the exposure of an empty stomach to the damp 
and poisonous influence of the morning air, he 
ever counselled those whose vocation called them 



16 AVHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

out early to first brace up the stomach with a 
warm and nourishing breakfast, for at no period 
of the day was the air more tainted than at sun- 
rise, in which it was a dangerous risk to take much 
exercise before the stomach had been fortified with 
a warm breakfast. 

Breakfast, coming after the longest fast in the 
twenty-four hours, should supply the great waste 
that goes on from supper till dinner. In this 
country this meal consists frequently of tea, coffee, 
and a small proportion of bread and butter. This 
is not enough for those who need a breakfast for 
muscular exertion or real activity. It does not 
give the strength that is needed to last until din- 
ner, and the system is sure to suffer. It only 
allays the appetite, and is insufficient for the sup- 
ply of bodily waste during the long interval 
between supper and dinner, — perhajDS a late one. 
As in pecuniary matters, when the outlay of the 
body exceeds the income, we may be sure the day 
of retribution will come, — that we shall sooner or 
later suffer. 

Those who go to their calling early should not 
only be fed with a nutritious breakfast, but should 
be served in sufficient season, that they may not 
eat hurriedly or insufficiently. Should we allow 
our cattle or horses to start out for half a day 



REASONS FOR A GOOD BREAKFAST. 17 

without being properly fed, we should stand a 
chance of hearing a remonstrance from philanthro- 
pists on " cruelty to animals." Can we work on a 
worthless breakfast more than they ? We should 
fitly feed our hungriness, for energy and morality 
have a great deal to do with what we are fed. 

A good breakfast is of vital importance to the 
temperance public. When our food sustains us 
properly, we do not have that " sinking feeling" 
which compels many to seek in the dram-shop that 
power which they ignorantly think can be obtained 
to give them the required strength to perform their 
work. We may be assured that real strength can 
be secured from the ris^ht kind of food and cook- 
ery, which means, in plain discourse, that a plenty 
of pure, nourishing, and well-cooked food w^ill 
supply us with all the stimulation and strength w^e 
'require, and are a safeguard against lager beer 
and whiskey. " Poor rations are demoralizing, 
and drive many to intemperance. When man 
does not get the stimulating nourishment w^hich 
his nature craves, he becomes demoralized, and 
resorts to the dram-shop to supply the want of 
good and stimulating food." 



WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 



II. WHAT ANIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 

The Bible's bill of animal food for man's diet is 
the best, purest, most delicate, and most popular 
that has ever been introduced, all civilized people, 
with few exceptions, living up to it (many unwit- 
tingly, though ?). How fortunate that God decided 
the animal food question. He well knew what 
animal food was unsanitary, and quickly foresaw, 
that if man was left unrestrained in this matter, 
great confusion and fatal consequences w^ould re- 
sult. Had no danger existed, there would have 
been no need of an exact and imperative prohibition 
and allowance, wherein has been established more 
complete sanitary eating than physiologists could 
have effected for ages, had they been the author. 
Without this Bible restriction of animal food, 
it would have been no easy matter for them to 
convince man that he could not eat of any 
kind of flesh in the animal kingdom that pleased 
him. 

That God intended for man to eat animal food 
is evident from the plain directions which He 
has given. His instructions are, that the animals 
to be eaten by him must be pure, and allows only 



WHAT ANIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 19 

those for his diet that are fastidious eaters, and 
require for their subsistence clean and vegetable 
food, which makes their flesh pure, wholesome, 
delicate, refined, dainty, and easily digested. 

Can any one fail to see the wisdom, carefulness, 
and hygiene in God's allowance of animal food for 
His people found in Lev. xi. and Deut. xiv. ? 
Surely, He cares for our bodies as well as for 
our souls. For convenience, I copy hereinto the 
cataloofues of wholesome and unwholesome ani- 
mals recorded in the Bible. 



Wholesome Anbials. 

"And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, 
saying. These are the beasts which ye shall eat 
anions: all the beasts that are on the earth. 
Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, 
and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye 
shall eat." 

" These are the beasts which ye shall eat. The 
ox, the sheep, and the goat, the hart, and the roe- 
buck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and 
the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois-, and 
every beast that parteth the hoof and cheweth the 
cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat." 

" These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters. 



20 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Whatsoever hath scales and fins m the waters, in 
the seas, in the rivers, them shall ye eat." 

There can be no doubt but this category of fish 
for food by Moses is the most wholesome. They 
are not very oily, but delicate and easily digested. 
The Great Naturalist's zoological marks so plainly 
discriminate the wholesome from the unwhole- 
some animals, that the eye of the unlearned can 
readily make the distinction. 

No o:eneral catalosfue is o-iven in the Bible for 
wholesome birds, yet the same principle is ob- 
served as for quadrupeds, — they must subsist on 
clean food. " Of all clean birds ye may freely 
eat." 

Unwholesome Animals. 

The Bible plainly teaches that the animals which 
the great Law-giver forbade man to eat are not 
clean eaters, but live on carrion and prey, eating 
their food in filth, which makes their flesh un- 
wholesome and not fit for man's food. 

"Nevertheless, ye shall not eat of them that 
chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof, as 
the camel, because he cheweth the cud but divideth 
not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. And the 
hare and the coney, for they chew the cud, but 
divide not the hoof, therefore they are unclean 



WHAT AXIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 21 

unto you. And the swine, though he divide the 
hoof, yet he cheAveth not the cud, he is unclean 
unto you ; ye shall not eat their flesh." 

"Whatsoever hath no fins and scales, in the seas 
and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, 
and of any living thing njliich is in the icaters, 
they shall be an abomination unto you ; 3^e shall 
not eat of their flesh." 

Unwholesome Birds. 

Carnivorous birds, as well as quadrupeds, are 
forbidden. "And these are they which ye shall 
have in abomination among the fowls, they shall 
not be eaten. The eagle, and the ossifrage, and 
the osprey, and the vulture, and the kite after his 
kind, and the owl, and the nighthawk, and the 
cuckoo, and the great and the little owl, and the 
swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and 
the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the 
lapwing, and the bat. All fowls that creep, going 
upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you." 

Creeping Things. 

"These also shall be unclean unto you among 

the creeping things that creep upon the earth. 

The weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after 

his kind, and the ferret, and the chameleon, and 



22 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

the lizard, and the snail, and the mole, and every 
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, it 
shall not be eaten." 

'^ This is the law of the beasts, and the fowl, 
and of every living thing that moveth in the 
waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon 
the earth." 

The laws for animal food hold a very prominent 
part in the revelation given to Moses. Wonder- 
fully few accessions have been made by succeeding 
generations to his list of edible animals, and with 
only a few exceptions his animal food laws have 
been kept by all subsequent civilized people. 
Only starvation would tempt a civilized man to 
accept a slice of turkey-buzzard, dog, ca;t, or 
horse (although the latter is one of the most 
fastidious feeders). These animals, with many 
others that shock the palate, were not any more 
forbidden, or held in greater aversion by Moses, 
than swine's flesh. Yet many of us, in this en- 
lightened Christian age, in this triumphant civil- 
ization of the nineteenth century, are living in a 
senseless disregard of one of Moses' animal food 
laws, and of all the animals forbidden none have 
been so persistently eaten by Christians as swine's 
flesh ! 

To the reader it must be plain that swine were 



WHAT ANIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 23 

no more forbidden by the law than other un- 
wholesome animals, but that the greater sensation, 
then as now, was produced by the people's per- 
sistence in eating them. Their physical record now 
stands worse than ever, and if they were human, 
the popular anti-fat remedy would be at once 
advised. Surely, pork is now fearfully dangerous, 
and our latest medical advices agree with Moses, 
the law-giver, in disallowing it. 

That good and faithful Physician, who is wiser 
than any of us, well understood the hygienic 
bearings of animal food, when He allowed only 
the flesh of those animals for man's diet that was 
the least trying to his stomach and health. From 
his hygienic meat laws we learn the general prin- 
ciples of diet, — that whatever we eat and drink 
should be pure and easy of digestion ; likewise, 
that the safest way is to eat and drink on these 
Bible principles. 

Although pork is largely used throughout all 
Christendom, yet I cannot judiciously give it a 
place in this breakfast director}^ There will be 
no danger of starvation if it is dispensed with. 
The world is full of good things, so we can easily 
repudiate it. Just as good, and much more 
wholesome dishes can be sfotten without it. ^o

24 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

no lard, no " delicate cured hams," no frogs' legs, 
" because they taste like chicken," and no other 
animal food will be introduced, that is not included 
in Moses' catalosfue of wholesome animal food. 

Fats. 

When God created the human stomach. He 
knew just what machinery to place in it, and 
there is no better evidence of the need of fat as 
food than that furnished by nature, which has pro- 
vided the pancreatic juice for the special purpose 
of its digestion. For hundreds of years man 
could not divine how fat was digested. After 
much laborious study, he has lately found out that 
God planned the pancreas at the first for its diges- 
tion. The coarse sort of fats, such as train and 
goose oil, pork and lard, should be eschewed, 
being very trying to most stomachs. It is allowed 
by physicians that the delicate fats found in beef, 
mutton, fowl, eggs, butter, cheese, milk, and del- 
icate fish afibrd all that is necessary to maintain 
the animal heat and working power of the body, 
ordinarily. These, too, should be used wisely — 
only what our wants require, it being a matter of 
individual peculiarity, some being able to digest 
more fat than others. 



WINTER AND SUMMER BREAKFASTS. 25 



III. WINTER AND SUMMER BREAKFASTS. 

The two great divisions of food are nitrogenous, 
or flesh-forming, and carbonaceous, or heat-giving. 
Sub-divisions are made by physiologists, but these 
two cover the ground sufficiently for this purpose. 
Fix in your mind that the nitrogenous articles of 
food produce blood and flesh, and that the non- 
nitrogenous or carbonized, produce heat, and you 
will have a key that will unlock many of the 
mysteries of diet. Our food contains more or 
less, of these elements. Some have no nitroo-en, 
some no carbon, and some both properties in va- 
rious proportions. 

Winter Breakfasts. 

The three kinds or classes of food, the special 
oflace of which is to support animal heat and 
produce fat, are the oils, the sweets, and the 
starches, and these have little or no influence in 
promoting strength, muscle, or endurance. Fat 
is one of the most powerful agents in the produc- 
tion of animal heat. 

From this we learn that the object of eating is 
to strengthen and keep us warm. Carbon, or 



26 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

charcoal, when burned in our grates, gives out 
heat. When taken into the system, in the form 
of food, the burning process that it undergoes 
there a'ives to us a warmth which is called vital 
heat. It keeps up the fire of life. It is this 
which sustains human life, and it must be pro- 
duced by the internal combustion of the carbona- 
ceous elements of the food we eat. In vain 
would the softest seal-skin or blanket enwrap our 
bodies without that warmth which comes from 
within. 

Consequently, the keener the cold weather, the 
more carbonized or heat-producing food we re- 
quire to keep up the fire of life. On a sharp 
winter's morning, the breakfast we eat decides 
our efficiency for execution through the da}^ 
The heating material taken at supper has been 
appropriated during the night, and if the system 
is not supplied by a carbonaceous, as well as a 
nitrogenous breakfast, our whole being will be so 
badly influenced through the forenoon, that neither 
the dinner nor the supper will repair it ; but when 
properly fed, with food containing both these ele- 
ments, such as meats, grains, fats, sweets, and 
starch, our vital action vrill be sustained in full 
force, so that we can work vigorously for at least 
five hours before another reinforcement of strenofth 



WINTER AND SUMMER BREAKFASTS. 27 



and warmth from food is needed. We all know 
that, so long as a person feels cold all through his 
body, no work is done to advantage. As the cold 
weather approaches, it is absolutely necessary that 
we gradually change the cooling breakfast of the 
hot weather to a more nutritious and heat-pro- 
ducing one — more meats, fats, sweets. 

Summer Breakfasts. 
Were we to pursue the plan of eating the heat- 
producing breakfasts in summer which we found 
beneficial to our well-being in winter, a highly 
feverish state of blood would be produced, and 
inflannnatory diseases created. In the spring, a 
gradual change in the nature of diet is necessary. 
Less fats, sweets, and starch, as in line flour, are 
needed. Continue the muscle-making food, such 
as the darker portion of grains, milk, lean meats, 
fowl, and fish. Fish contain a small proportion 
of heating power, and in summer are well adapted 
to the wants of the system. Banish from your 
breakfast buckwheat cakes and molasses. Use 
more of the entire product of the grain (except 
the hull). Use the early salads and cooling vege- 
tables which succeed each other in their season. 
The delightful berry and melon, which contain no 
carbon at all, should be freely eaten at breakfast. 



2S WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Those who pursue this plan feel no real loss of 
health, and find it far more aoTeeable than druo-s 
and doctors' bills. 

Physiologies are now plenty. They furnish us 
with a knowledge of the elements of the human 
body. Their tables, showing the nature or ele- 
ments of both the animal and veg^etable diet' de- 
sio^ned for the subsistence of 'man will o^ive one a 
new sense of tlie relation of food to health. 



THE GENUINE BREAKFAST. 29 



IV. THE GENUINE BREAKFAST. 

How pleasant those homes where genuine break- 
fasts are appreciated; where cooking morality 
is of importance, and the food is aesthetically 
prepared. Feeling assured of a satisfying bill of 
flire, with what cheerfulness the fiimily respond to 
the news of the morning repast. Who can deny 
the comforts, luxury, and moral benefit of this 
meal in one's own cheerful breakfast-room, where 
the cutlets are sweet to the senses, the baked pota- 
toes dainty and mealy, the biscuits of an ethereal 
nature; where the coffee is fragrant and delicate, 
and possessed of such charms that spirituous bev- 
erages have no temptation; where the cream 
comes safely from the cow to the pitcher; and 
where each dish brings health and pleasure. 

Such a breakfast is absolutely perfect, because 
attractive, wholesome, nutritious, simple, and 
easily digested, leaving the stomach comfortable, 
the head so clear, the spirits so light, and the 
vital forces so supplied that amiable visages, clear 
financiering, speculation, and imagination are the 
speedy compensation. Beside, the stomach, when 



30 AVHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

in this beautiful condition, is a moral force ; and 
if (as is sometimes said) many of the evils of 
the world are traceable to bad and scanty food, 
with this kind of breakfast one should not fail to 
be a better man or woman throughout the day. 



THE COUNTERFEIT BREAKFAST. 31 



V. THE COUNTERFEIT BREAKFAST. 

A HOME without a good breakfast — how shall 
we describe it? Instead of the sunny courtesy 
with which a man comes to a faultless breakfast, 
he who has no assurance of a satisfying morning 
repast, comes like a man v/ho has had bad news 
broken to him, and most likely with a " breach of 
peace " pictured on his face. Yet, if this man had 
the same assurance of an attractive breakfast of 
wdiich the courteous one was confident, he might 
have excelled him in politeness. 

Pity the sorrows of those who are not especially 
favored with a genuine breakfast, that stimulates 
the bod}^ lightens the spirits, clears the thought, 
gives moral force, and recompenses by generally 
resisting the foes of life, for he who is badly and 
scantily fed in the morning has not the moral 
safeguard through the day of him who has been 
w^ell fed at breakftist. 

When so much depends on this meal, is it not 
surprising that so many treat it indifferently ? A 
broiled beefsteak, a digestible breakfast-cake, a 
dainty baked potato, a clear cup of coffee, are 
especial wonders in many families, who have 



32 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

never dreamed that a square and satisfying break- 
fast has much to do with the prosperity of humanity. 
In this enlightened republic, instead of breaking 
fast with a plenty of simple and nourishing food, 
how many begin the labors of the day with a scanty, 
unattractive, and indigestible breakfast, which 
exhausts instead of supplying the forces ! 

Bacon or pork served swimming in grease, 

— steak fried or broiled till the life has srone out 
of it, and consequently so tough and hard that one 
could eat and enjoy a side of leather about as 
easily, — cold potatoes warmed over in fat that 
suggests the longevity of both fat and the vessel 
in which it was preserved, — a hastened corn-cake 
so rank with soda that the stoni^ach is made un- 
happy through the day, — a choice mutton-chop 
transformed beyond recognition, — muffins burned 
to a cinder, by forcing them with too hot an oven, 

— scrambled eggs, and griddle-cakes made leath- 
ery for want of promptness, — the coffee, alas! 
for that precious cup, that benefactor of mankind, 
so invaluable to many for its gentle stimulating 
powers, and especially designed for sustenance 
instead of dangerous wine, — this indispensable 
comfort so muddy and bitter that you cannot 
recognize its first principles ; and to complete its 
transformation, the milk served in an unsanitary 



THE COUNTERFEIT BREAKFAST. 33 

pitcher ! These are familiar breakfasts in many 
families. 

Dangerous breakftists these. They do not fitly 
feed hunger. The hungry body vainly tries to 
recuperate in its efibrts to digest this wretchedly- 
cooked food not " convenient " for it, so that what 
might have been done had the food been rightly 
cooked, remains undone. Determination, appli- 
cation, and patience will enable one to serve a 
very difierent morning meal, with a little earlier 
rising, if necessary, for a breakfast gotten in "no 
time " usually drifts its own way. 

There is much truth in those old proverbs 
which say that "necessity knows no law," and 
that "hunger will make a hungry monkey eat 
pepper." This land is flowing with ivhiskey 
and lager. He who has not been fitly fed at 
breakfast is unsafe, for before noon the inward 
craving is sure to make a demand, which must 
be satisfied ; and the saloons become an easy 
resort for eking out a poor breakfast. A man 
disappointed in this meal can easily console his 
hummer with somethino^ to drink. Breakfast Avas 
insufiicient to give him strength ; he must have 
something to make up the want, and he foolishly 
believes he can quickly get it from a glass of

whiskey or beer, which gives him spasmodic 
strength for a brief time, but when the reaction 
comes leaves him worse ofi than ever. Is it not 
wise ix) teach that a breakfast unfailingly good, 
with all the elements that stimulate and nourish 
the body, has its moral as well as physical 
benefit ? 



SECTION^ II. 



MEASURES, SODA AND SOUR MILK. 37 



II. 

MEASURES. 

The measures for this breakfast book are half- 
pint cups, tea and table spoons. As these vary in 
size, the safest way is to have one particular cup 
and spoon for cooking measures, which have been 
proved by a sure standard. 

For a cupful the ordinary breakfast-cup is used, 
that holds half a pint. 

Two cupfuls mean a pint. 

A cupful means half a pint. 

A teaspoonful means just rounding full and not 
heaped. 

SODA AND SOUR MILK. 

Great numbers wdio profusely use soda, for light- 
ening bread, are ignorant of its nature, and not 
aware that it is ruinous to the human stomach 
when not neutralized by an acid. When the soda 
and acid are used in just the right proportions to 
neutralize each other, they are not considered in- 
jurious to health, provided they are pure. 

In olden times sour milk was exclusively used 
for neutralizing soda. In later times cream-tartar 



38 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

has been much used instead, as a greater conven- 
ience. At present it cannot be depended upon, on 
account of its adulteration ; consequent!}^, cautious 
people are falling back on sour milk again, feeling 
confident of its purity. Meantime, somehow, 
many have lost the knack of compounding soda 
and sour milk as accurately as their predecessors, 
who never used too much, neither too little soda, 
but always the right quantity. My mother's table 
was always furnished with some kind of sour-milk 
bread, which was invariably the same, — always 
just right. 

AN OLD-SCHOOL HOUSEKEEPER 

will tell you that this chemical operation should 
be performed with caution, demanding knowledge 
and care ; also, that the safest way is to use 
smoothly-loppered or nicely soured milk instead 
of partly soured, the exact proportions being one 
teaspoon of soda to one pint of sour milk. 

Should you have to resort to milk when only 
partly soured, the exact amount of soda now de- 
pends on the acidity of the milk, and you cannot I 
so accurately proportion your soda as for nicely 
soured or loppered milk or cream- tartar, which is, 
or should be, always the same. The safest way 
now, is to add a part of the measure of cream- 



SODA AND CREAM-TAKTAR. 39 

tartar [o your milk that you would use for the 
same quantity of sweet milk. The addition of 
this to the partly soured milk will make it the 
right acidity for the usual measure of soda. You 
cannot use the whole measure of cream-tartar, 
which is two teaspoonfuls to a pint of sweet milk, 
as the measure of soda (one teaspoonful) is only 
enough to sweeten a part of each acid. This 
mode relieves you of guessing, which many adopt 
who have not the skill of guessing just right the 
required amount, and usually err by getting an 
.overdose of soda ; hence the effect, — cakes of a 
golden hue, smelling strong of soda. 

In the receipts for sour-milk breakfast-cakes, I 
would have it distinctly understood that I have 
adopted the following rule as a general one : 
One teaspoonful of soda to one jpint of nicely 
soured or loppered milk, 

SODA AND CREAM -TARTAR. 

Pure cream-tartar and soda have no equal for 
making convenient breakfest-cakes. For very 
small cakes, such as griddles, muffins, waffles, 
and various breakfast-cakes, it is quite usual to

readil}^ unite and produce the desired gas for 
liofhteninof the bread. This is now considered the 
better and surer way, as the success of these light- 
ening ingredients depends on their equal distribu- 
tion throughout the flour. When thoroughly 
incorporated with the flour, you avoid finding 
those lumps of soda in various parts of the bread, 
which give it a yellow color and disagreeable 
flavor. To neutralize each, use one teaspoonful of 
soda to two of cream-tartar. These proportions 
have been accurately allowed by chemists, 

HOME-MADE YEAST. 

It is a convenience to know how to make good 
yeast when you cannot buy it. If you have not 
sweet old yeast to start the new with, you can 
create some by making of flour and water a thin 
batter, and letting it stand in a warm place till 
fermented. This will be as efiective as old yeast 
for starting the new and fresher, giving a sweet 
and pleasant flavor to the bread. When yeast is 
entirely new, you get sweeter bread than when 
started with old and half-decayed yeast, which 
produces an unpleasant flavor with a certainty. 
When it has a tart smell and a watery appearance 
on the surface it is too stale to use. 

Home-made dried yeast-cakes are not reliable, 



HOME-MADE YEAST. 41 

and do not make bread of the first quality. 
Potato yeast is reliable, and considered better 
than that made in the usual way. The dough 
made from it does not sour as readily, but will 
remain perfectly sweet until it has increased twice 
the original quantity, requiring a little extra time 
for rising. Bread made from this yeast is sweet, 
light, and does not dry quickly. Yeast made 
from the following receipt will keep four weeks in 
hot weather, in a cold place : — 

Two quarts of water. 

One cup of hops. 

Four good potatoes. 

One cup of sugar. 

One dessert-spoon of ginger. 

Half a cup of salt. 

Boil the hops half an hour in the two quarts of 
water. Peal, boil, and mash the potatoes very 
fine. Strain the hop- water through a fine strainer 
and mix with the potato, sugar, ginger, and salt. 
When blood-warm stir in a cupful of sweet and 
lively yeast, or a cake of compressed, dissolved in 
warm water. Keep it covered in a warm room 
five or six hours, when it is usually sufiiciently 
effervesced. While getting light give it a good 
beating several times. When sufficiently light. 



42 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

pour it into sweet glass jars, cork tight, and keep 
it in a cool cellar or place. 

Less sugar and salt may be used in cold weather, 
as these are desis^ned to arrest excessive fermenta- 
tion. The ginger is intended to keep the yeast 
from souring. The quantity directed does not 
affect the flavor of the bread. Some use flour to 
thicken yeast, but it will keep longer without. 
Those who have once used these directions are un- 
willing to relinquish them. 

BREAKFAST FARES. 

Breakfast is usually quickly and hurriedly pre- 
pared, requiring undivided attention. For a cook 
to worry her brain trying to think of half a 
dozen or more different dishes for this meal, seems 
a serious mistake. Commonly, three or four 
nicely-cooked dishes after the grain course will 
answer better in every way. In the following 
bills of fare for breakfasts, this number of newly- 
cooked dishes is suggested, w^hich will greatly 
lessen the labor of the housekeeper, and save her 
from that disapproving conscience which she is 
sure to experience when a greater number is at- 
tempted, and the result is an array of half-spoiled 
dishes. 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 43 

Eiicli bill of fare offers all the chemical elements 
required for nutrition, consisting usually of veo-e- 
table and animal food, leaving the quantity to be 
regulated by the appetite and individual necessity. 
Each dish is plainly prepared, so that the distinc- 
tive characteristics of the food may be retained. 
In the temperate zone instinct demands a varied 
diet adapted to the rapid changes of the climate. 
The different bills of fare sus^o^ested, 2:ive the in- 
dividual an opportunity for the selection of such a 
breakfast as the season and the necessity demand. 

The grain course is suggested as a first course, 
a plan now being adopted to prevent the immoder- 
ate use of animal food, to which many are given, 
and which is condemned by Hygiene. 

Fruit is suggested as last, yet this is not arbi- 
trary. It does not matter what place it occupies, 
if only this wise sanitary custom of eating fruit in 
the morning is observed.

BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 

Beefsteak deserves the highest rank among 
breakfast fares. This Bible and chemically sanc- 
tioned food, purposely designed for man, is very 
satisfying to the stomach, and possesses great 
strengthening powers. To replenish the animal 
sph'its there is no food like beef, and when kept 
till properly tender, and properly cooked, nothing- 
will give the stomach less trouble. It is iron 
which gives the red color to flesh. Beef is not 
wantinof in this life-o^ivino; element, which oives a 
decided verdict in its favor.

Cracked Wheat. 
Beefsteak. Macaroni. Eggs on Toast. 



Coffee. Ripe Fruit. 

CRACKED WHEAT. 

Wheat as food is the most important of the 
grains, because it is more available for all the 
wants of the system than any of the other grains. 
It is said to be as nearly a perfect natural food as 
milk, containing everything in itself to support 
life, being composed of the same elements as the 
human body, and in about the same proportions. 

Sifting and Bolting lessen these properties 
to a serious extent. The l)ran, Avhich is thrown 
away, contains about forty per cent of the nutri- 
ment of the grain. The miller robs it of its 
gluten and albumen, which make muscular 
strength ; of its mineral and phosphatic prop- 
erties, which nourish bone, muscle, and brain. 

The only way now for us to secure this grain in 
perfection, and restore brain, bone, and muscle, 
is to cook it unground. It is delicious as well as 
w^holesome when eaten with a dressing of cream 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 49 

or milk, fi'uit, sugar, or sirup, and is much used 
by those who understand the philosophy of grains. 

Cracked wheat is only in perfection when 
cooked in a double boiler, for it is an essential 
rule that grains of all kinds should never be 
stirred while cooking. This rule cannot be ob- 
served when cooked in a single boiler. When 
done, each grain should be charmingly light and 
porous, distinct, yet jelly-like. When watery, it 
is not palatable or attractive, and spoils the nice 
flavor and richness of the milk. The water should 
be boiling in the outside boiler, and boiling Avater 
put into the inside boiler. To nearly a quart of 
boiling water put a teaspoonful of salt, and a half- 
pint cupful of cracked wheat. Boil three hours 
or more, or till done. Grains are very unwhole- 
some and disagreeable when underdone. 

For breakfast it should be cooked the day pre- 
vious, and reheated in the morning, as there is 
not time then to give it the long cooking it needs. 
When reheated for breakfast, do not remove it 
from the inner boiler, but fill the outer boiler w^ith 
l)oiling water, and let it boil till heated through. 
Do not add w^ater to the inner boiler. Many pre- 
fer it cold. It takes the mould, and should be 
poured into it while hot, or before the starch is 
set, which makes a handsome dish when served 
cold. 



50 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

BEEFSTEAK. 

Never fry a beefsteak. People who know what 
really good cooking is, do not fry l)eefsteak. 
When fried in fat, it is both vulgar and indigesti- 
ble. Broiling, which suddenly hardens the sur- 
face, and keeps the juice within the steak, is the 
most eligTl)le style for cooking beefsteak, and 
those who wish to invigorate themselves adopt it. 

The appearance of beefsteak is injured by 
pounding it. If you suspect it is tough, the bet- 
ter method is to cut several parallel strokes across 
it on each side, with a sharp knife, not cutting 
through, but lightly cutting the surface. The 
quick heat will unite the incisions again, and when 
cooked you will hardly perceive them. If there 
is much fat, trim it off, else it will drop on the 
coals and smoke. 

A lioht wire o^ridiron, tliat can be turned 
quickly, is best. Have a clear and hot fire, that 
will last through your l^roiling. For a minute, 
hold each side to the fire, to car])onize the surface 
before the broiling begins. This method saves 
the juice of the meat. When car1)onized, expose 
it to a slower heat and broil it. Turn frequently, 
but do not stick a fork into it while broiling, or 
the juice will escape. Broil your steak lightly or 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 51 

rare, but not mw. Have your outside a good 
meat brown, your inside a nice red. Never salt 
steak while broiling, as it extracts the juice. 
When done, sprinkle it h'ghtly with salt, lay it on 
a hot dish, Avith a few small pieces of butter, but 
do not have it swimming in l)utter, as the juice is 
supposed to be inside the steak. Pepper should 
be an individual application, if you do not know 
the desire of your guests. Set the platter in the 
oven a moment, to melt the butter. To be nice, 
it must be served hot. 

EGGS ON TOAST. 

Have in a spider boiling hot water, yet not lit- 
erally boiling, and enough to cover an egg, when 
broken into it. Add a teaspoonful of salt. Place 
as many muffin rings in the water as is needed. 
Break each egg into a cup, then turn it gently 
into a rinof. Let them cook without boilins^. 
When delicately cooked, or till the eggs are cov- 
ered with a white film, remove the rings, and lay 
each egg on a slice of toast. This method gives 
a much handsomer dish than when dropped the 
usual way. Toast your bread in season for the 
eggs when done. Have ready a pan of hot water. 
Dip each slice quicklj^, only moistening, not soak- 
ing it, and place in the platter for the eggs. 



52 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

MACARONI 

should be washed and broken into lengths of live 
or six inches. Put into a plenty of hot water 
previously salted. Boil half an hour, or until 
tender. Meanwhile, for the average quantity, 
scald half a cup of rich milk, and, while hot, add 
a table-spoon of butter, which pour over the mac- 
aroni, when ready to be served. In the winter, 
when potatoes are poor and unwholesome, this 
dish makes a very welcome substitute. 

COFFEE. 

The coffee, jmr excellence, is an equal mixture 
of Java and Mocha, one giving strength, the other 
flavor and aroma. 

Coifee connoisseurs prefer roasting their own 
coffee, or having a personal supervision of it. 
First, let your coffee get well dried and heated, 
then put it where it will roast. It should have 
undivided attention, and be stirred constanll}^ till 
done. If left half a minute, the kernels next the 
kettle may burn black, and these will spoil all the 
rest. To have good coffee, it must be evenly 
roasted a dark, rich brown. Black, burnt coffee 
has a bitter flavor, instead of being finely flavored, 
like nicely-roasted coffee. 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 53 

After your coffee is roasted, the next important 
feature is the grinding, which should be mod- 
erately fine. If ground too fine and powdery, it 
is hard to make it clear ; if too coarse, you lose 
much of the streno^th and aroma. It should be 
freshly ground each time it is used. Coffee 
should be kept in a dry place, in a tin can, or 
glass jar, tightly closed. 

The next thing is the cleanliness of your coffee- 
pot, of which many never suspect the importance, 
and do not empty their coffee-pot of dregs till 
obliged to. Coffee is just as imperfect as other 
food that has been cooked in an unwashed vessel. 
The coffee-pot should not be allowed to become 
coated with coffee dregs, but carefully washed 
every time it is used, in hot suds, rinsed, wiped 
dry, and set on the stove, where it will get per- 
fectly dry. 

It seems a waste of time to write out a recipe 
for making coffee, as most housekeepers have 
their favorite method. Messrs. Blot and Delmon- 
ico were very emphatic about the impropriety of 
boiling coffee, preferring it made in a French 
filter. Without any disrespect to either, the 
Avriter differs from their sanctioned opinions, and 
gives her experience of the coffee question. 

The ordinary coffee-pot was always used in my 



54 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

family. To clear the coffee, an egg, with the 
shell crushed, was stirred into a cup of moderately 
ground coffee before putting it into the coffee-pot, 
when a quart of boiling water was poured to both, 
the coffee-pot tightly closed, and boiled eight or 
ten minutes. A cupful was then poured out, to 
clear the spout from dregs, pouring the same back 
again. While clearing, which should take six or 
seven minutes, set on the back of the stove, 
where it can be kept hot. It is a mistake not 
to let coffee wait a few minutes after clearing the 
spout. With good cream, this was as delicious 
coffee as need be ; and I would say that you do 
not have coffee in perfection unless you have good 
cream. No matter how nice your coffee, how 
well roasted, or how boiled, if you do not have 
cream for an accompaniment, you do not have 
delicious and perfect coffee. Never decant coffee, 
for much flavor is lost by pouring it from one 
vessel to the other. 

Observe the following rules, and, without new 
inventions, they will give you good coffee. Buy 
good coffee. Roast it an even brown. Have a 
clean coffee-pot. Serve it in the vessel in which 
it was boiled. Boil quickly. Have cream, if you 
can ; else hot, but not boiled milk.

This simple and easily digested breakfast is a 
very valuable one for those who need much nour- 
ishment in a small compass. The accompaniments 
can be changed to suit one's taste and condition. 

SIRLOIN BEEFSTEAK. 

Take three slices of beefsteak, one a sirloin, 
and two from the round, as the round yields more 
juice than any other cut. Broil them rapidly and 
lightly. When cooked, place the choice sirloin in 
the middle of a platter, and add a little butter. 
With a meat-squeezer, press the juice entirely 
from the rounds over the sirloin. Serve at once. 
The essence of rare beef thus expressed is con- 
sidered a better tonic by some physicians than 
beef tea prepared the usual way. 



56 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 



BUTTERED TOAST. 

Yevy few know just how to toast bread nicely. 
Though simple and easy it often gets spoiled, and 
is seldom seen without symptoms of burning. 
The bread must not be too fresh. To make but- 
tered toast in perfection, you want a very light stale 
loaf of raised bread. You need a clear lire, and it 
is best when only one slice is toasted at a time, 
holding it at just the distance from the fire to 
brown nicely and without scorching. The whole 
surface of each side should be a golden brown. 
The perfect way is to butter each slice when taken 
from the fire, and serve immediately, being in 
perfection only when freshly done. When not 
convenient to serve immediately, pile the toast as 
you finish it on a plate, cover it with a deep tin, 
and keep it in an open oven till served. 



BAKED APPLE SAUCE. 

Fill a baking dish with nice juicy apples, peeled, 
cored, and quartered. Strew sugar over them. 
Fit a plate closely over the dish, Avhich set in a 
larger pan, with hot water in the bottom, about an 
inch in depth. Set it in the oven, and bake till 
clear and tender. If they are not very juicy, put

two ta])les})oons of water to them. Prepare the 
day previous for breakfast, — very nice. 

COCOA. 

In this age of adulteration, w^ise and cautious 
people, who like to know what they drink, use 
cracked cocoa, or shells and cocoa mixed. To half 
or three-quarters of a cup of cracked cocoa, add 
one quart of boiling water, and cook tw^o and a 
half or three hours. When sufficiently boiled, 
add sufficient hot water to make up for the evapo- 
ration and to make it the right strength. Add 
sufficient milk, and let the whole come to a boiling 
point, but do not let it boil, as boiled milk gives 
an unpleasant flavor ; or, you can heat the milk 
separately, adding a part to the cocoa pot and the 
rest to the cream pitcher, from which supply to 
your taste. The perfection of cocoa is its liberal 
supply of milk.

This tempting dish can be eaten with a dressing

a delicious dressing for it, — also, it is nice eaten 
as a veo-etable with meats. Select the white 
wheat, if it can be obtained, as it cooks more 
readily and looks more inviting. Wash it well, 
turn off all that rises to the surface of the water, 
then drain it dry. If there is any foreign matter, 
it should be picked out. Put it into an inner 
boiler, with five or six times its measure of boiling 
water. Add boiling water to the outer boiler and 
cook six or eight hours, or until all have opened 
out similar to the kernels of popped corn. For 
breakfast it should be cooked the day previous, 
and reheated like cracked wdieat. 



BKEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 59 



RUMP BEEFSTEAK. 
The ])est cuts are from the middle of the rump, 
^vhich has much flavor, and is preferred by many. 

"Broil lightly your beefsteak — to fry it, 
Argues contempt of Christian diet." 

BAKED POTATOES. 

Americans are very fond of baked potatoes as 
an accompaniment to steak. When in perfection, 
mealy, and of the first quality in flavor, they are 
unrivalled. Unless they can be presented in this 
dainty condition, it is far better that they should 
be disguised and made palatable by some artifice 
which the French resort to ; for unless these 
tubers are in mealy perfection, they are not easily 
disrested. However well baked, their excellence 
depends on their being served immediatel3% as 
they quickly lose their lightness, and " the glory 
of a baked potato is its mealiness." 

RAISED BISCUIT, 
light as a foam, ''The lighter the better, altho' 
many do not think so." This is Prof. Blot's 
philosophy. '' Lightness is a most important 
quality in warm biscuit, as it enables them to be 



60 V/HAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

more easily acted upon by the digestive fluids," 
which v/ill force a rapid passage through light 
biscuit, but can penetrate a rubber ball about as 
easily as heavy baked ones. What is so rare as 
light, white, and thin-crusted home-made raised 
biscuit for breakfjist? Yet this luxury can be 
easily attained if the dough is well raised. 

In warm weather, raised dough can be kept for 
two or three days for morning biscuit, if covered 
with a damp cloth and set in a cold place, where 
it will not sour. In cold weather, if set in a cool 
place, where there is no danger of freezing, it will 
keep the same length of time. Certainly this is 
a convenience, and many think it improves the 
dough, if it can be kept sweet. 

If you are a novice, you must learn at the out- 
set that you cannot have good biscuit or bread 
without the best quality of flour, fresh and lively 
yeast. It is advisable to use compressed yeast, 
as it is best when it can be had fresh. Too 
much salt destroys the nice flavor of bread, too 
little makes it insipid. Liquid yeast is sometimes 
quite salt ; in this case you must be cautious about 
salting your bread. Compressed yeast requires 
salt in the bread. 

A little too much heat injures biscuit, and too 
little ruins them. If the oven is .too hot, they 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFAPTS. ^'1 



Avill bake outside before the heat penetrates the 
centre, consequently you have them heavy and 
underdone in the middle. Unless the oven is hot 
enough the biscuit will spread. One that does not 
bake at the bottom will be likely to spoil your bis- 
cuit. A great deal depends on the oven. 

For morning biscuit, mix dough at nine o'clock 
in the evening. Scald your milk, and there will 
not be the danger of its souring. If not conve- 
nient to use milk, use all or a part water, and rub 
a teaspoonful of butter into the flour. 

RULE. 

One quart of sifted flour. 
One pint of warm milk. 
Half a cake of compressed, 
Or half a cup of liquid, yeast. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 

Make a hollow in the flour and add the salt. 
Dissolve yeast if compressed in a little of the wet- 
ting, and with the milk pour into the hollow. 
Mix till it becomes a dough. Dredge your mould- 
ing board evenly with flour. Lay your dough 
upon it and knead twenty-five minutes. In knead- 
ing, use just flour enough to keep the dough from 
stickins: to the hands. The great mistake in mak- 



62 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

ing dough is getting it too stiff with flour. When 
the fingers can be pressed into it without sticking, 
your bread is kneaded enough. Learn to get the 
right consistency, without too much flour, which 
should be soft as possible Avithout sticking. 
Twenty-five minutes are long enough for the first 
kneading and ten for the second. When kneaded, 
return to the bowl, which should be earthen, as it 
is a better protection from cold than tin. Cover 
warm, and place where no draft of cold air can 
strike across it, for if allowed to be chano-ins: 
temperature while fermenting, it will hinder its 
rising, and your dough will be heavy. To rise 
Avell, it needs an even temperature of seventy 
degrees. 

In the morning, as soon as you go into your 
kitchen, with a spoon push the dough down from 
the top and sides of the pan, and let it rise again. 
When light, knead it ten minutes, lightly, avoid- 
ing much flour. When kneaded, cut little bits for 
your biscuit, mould with your hands into small 
rounds, without using any flour. Set them a little 
distance apart, in a lightly-l)uttered pan, cover 
with a cloth, and set where they can have an even 
temperature of eighty or eighty-five degrees. 
When risen to twice their size, they are ready for 
the oven. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes. When 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 63 

done, let them remain a few minutes, with the 
oven door open, to dry off the moisture and ripen, 
and prevent them from being sticky. 

You now have the secret of light biscuit. 
Nowadays many cooks rush their biscuit through 
in half or three-quarters of an hour for breakfast, 
which accounts for their being half- risen, half- 
baked, sticky and doughy in the mouth. May 
you see the folly of this, and rise in season to give 
your biscuit time to rise, bake, and dry off, else 
you will never have them light.

FRIED HASTY PUDDING. 

This hygienic mush is rarely found in perfection, 
but half raw and lumpy. When corn-meal hasty 



64 WHAT TO GET FOE BREAKFAST. 

pudding is made on purpose to fry for breakfast, 
it makes the slices stronger to mix a tablespoonful 
of flour with one quart of meal. Be careful to 
use no more flour. For frying, it should be made 
quite stiff*, and when for breakfast, it should be 
made the day before. 

A Scotch kettle is the best for making hasty 
pudding. First, stir a large portion of the meal 
to be used in cold water till there are no lumps. 
Stir this gradually into boiling water, which has 
been salted. If more is needed, stir in enough to 
make it the right consistency. Do not get it too 
hard and stiff*. After the meal is all in, it needs 
an hour's cooking or simmering, or it will taste 
raw. When done, mould it in a nice brick-loaf 
pan. From this shape you can cut handsome 
slices, which should be about three-quarters of an 
inch in thickness, or strong enough not to break. 
Fry on a griddle, well greased with beef drippings. 

TOMATO SAUCE. 

Pour boiling water over well ripened tomatoes, 
to remove the skins. When skinned, cut into a 
stew-pan, and stew briskly half an hour. Do not 
cook them too long, as it injures their peculiar 
taste. Salt them, adding a little pepper and but- 
ter, if aofreeable. 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 65 

"We need not eat the tomato with fear and 
trembling, as many are wont to do. There is no 
evil about it, and Avhen we don't take care of our- 
selves it will take care of us. It is a deliHitful 
substitute for calomel, and we may wonder how 
the ancestral liver could have been kept comforta- 
ble w^ithout this anti-bilious food. That it is in- 
valuable, and one of the most healthful esculents 
in the vegetable kingdom, is the popular opinion. 
Its healthful qualities do not depend on its mode 
of preparation, and it may be eaten twice or thrice 
per day with like advantage, cooked or uncooked, 
Avith or without a dressinof, and to the utmost that 
the appetite requires. Its healthful qualities con- 
sist in its slight acidity, wdiich makes it as impor- 
tant as fruit, and when the diet is largely meat 
and bread, it is inestimable." 

RIPE FRUIT. 

In the present age, you do not have an a la mode 
breakfast unless fruit is served. Fruit is a gra- 
cious sanitary provision by our Heavenly Father, 
to cleanse the blood of too much carl)on ; there- 
fore it is a very wdse fashion. For breakfast, it 
may be eaten when most agreeable, first or last. 
All kinds of fruit are admissible to the breakfast 
table that are thoroughly ripe. The undeveloped 



()6 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

juice of fruit is very unwholesome. For this rea- 
son, it would be the height of folly to eat it unripe. 
Fruits should be eaten as they grow. Spoil not 
this merciful contribution of Nature by disguising 
its pure and natural flavor. 



BREAKFAST No. 5.

Dried Apple Sauce. 
Bread and Butter. Coffee. 

This breakfast is w^ell patronized by hearty chil-

for their benefit. It should often be repeated. 

OATMEAL MUSH. 

You are not up to the times if 3^ou do not advo- 
cate oatmeal at your breakfast-table. " Prof. 
Liebig has chemically demonstrated, that oatmeal 
is almost as nutritious as the very best English 
beef, and that it is richer than wheat bread in the 
elements that go to bone and muscle." 

If this be true, surely every family should vote 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 67 

that they will give it a place at their hreakfast- 
table. With many it is so popular it is found at 
this morning meal the year round. 

At the best appointed tables it is served as a 
first course for breakfiist, the same as cracked 
vs^heat. 'Tis said to be best relished if eaten 
previous to the rest of the meal, beside being a 
convenient arrangement for the preparation of 
the rest of the breakfast. 

When nicely cooked, it is charmingly porous. 
Many spoil it by soaking it over night, and fre- 
quently stirring it while cooking. The only safe 
and perfect way of cooking it is in a double or 
farina boiler. If you give it a regular place at 
your breakfast table, you will save time and money 
by providing one expressly for cooking oatmeal. 
You will find it a great improvement on the old 
way of cooking, for you w^ill get a superior dish, 
with no waste or burning, neither made pasty, as 
by the stirring process. You may be sure of 
nicely-cooked oatmeal, when steamed in a double 
boiler.

ments ; then close the vessel, aiid boil one hour 
and a half. Oatmeal, served in a half-raw state, 
is both unwholesome and disao^reeable. 

FRIED CRACKED WHEAT. 

Cracked wheat for frying should be moulded in 
a brick-loaf baking-pan, which gives you hand- 
some slices. When cold, slice it about three- 
quarters of an inch thick. Fry it on a griddle, in 
beef drippings, the same as hasty pudding. Do 
not soak it in fat, only using enough to keep from 
sticking to the pan. 

DRIED APPLE SAUCE. 
Thoroughly wash dried apples. Put them to 
soak in cold water, more than will cover them, as 
they absorb a great deal. Soak the old-fashioned 
dried apples for several hours. Simmer them 
steadily in a preserving-kettle in the same water 
in which they were soaked, till cooked. Never 
stir them, but when they rise, press them down 
with a spoon. Keep them closely covered. When 
tender, add nice brown sugar, and simmer fifteen 
minutes longer. To be nice looking, they should 
retain their form somewhat, yet must be perfectly 
done. The delicate, sliced dried apple can be 
substituted, which requires only twenty minutes' 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 69 

soaking, and not as long cooking. Either are 
nice, when green apples fail. 

RAISED LOAF BREAD. 

There are no better rules for mixing, kneading, 
and raising bread, than those given in Breakfast 
No. 3 for raised biscuit. The measures there 
given can be doubled or trebled, to suit circum- 
stances. 

LIGHT BREAD 

is of great importance. The saliva and gastric 
juice penetrate it easily, and digestion is facili- 
tated. When dense and solid, these juices fail to 
act thoroughly, which is necessary to change bread 
into good blood. Undigested bread corrupts and 
decays, poisoning the blood as certainly as when 
eaten already spoiled. 

KNEADING 

raised bread is very important, making it evenly 
porous and easier of digestion. To be scientific, 
the thorough kneading should be done before the 
dough is raised, — before the gas is established; 
and it follows that as soon as mixed it should be 
thoroughly kneaded twenty-five or thirty minutes. 
If the thorouoh kneadins^ is done after the bread 



70 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

is raised, much of the gas you have taken the 
trouble to produce is pressed out of it. 

For raising dough, summer heat, or about 
seventy degrees, is most favorable. When the 
temperature is lower than this, the fermentation is 
so slow that there is danger of acidity before the 
gas has sufficiently formed. 

In an emergency, or haste, a temperature of 
ninety degrees can be used by lessening the re- 
quirable time, which is six or eight hours. In 
this case, the process must be watched, or it will 
sour. If you find it rising too fast, it can be 
arrested by setting it on the ice, or in a cool place. 

When sufficiently raised, it should be kneaded 
ten minutes only, using as little flour as possible ; 
then make it into loaves, put them into slightly- 
buttered pans, and raise the second time till nearly 
double their first size. If there is any danger of 
acidity, it is safer to bake a little sooner, for if 
the yeast has been thoroughly mixed with every 
part of the dough by kneading, the bread will be 
passably light, if the fermentation is a little less 
than the rule (doubling the dough). 

BAKING. 

It is a very nice point for a novice to decide, 
when the oven is the right temperature. An ex- 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 71 

perienced baker knows this without any rules. 
An inexperienced one can test the heat hy holdmg 
the hand in the oven long enough to count twenty. 
If the hand cannot bear the heat this lenoth of 
time, the oven is too hot, and the bread will bake 
outside before the heat has reached the centre, 
and it cannot rise. If not hot enough, your bread 
will lack s^veetness. 

When right, put your bread into the oven, and 
let it stand at this figure eight or ten minutes, that 
the heat may penetrate the very centre before the 
outside bakes. This will heat the loaf all throu2:h 
alike, and raise it evenly before crust-bound. 
Then increase the heat, and bake from forty min- 
utes to an hour, the time depending on the size of 
the loaf. Generally, we do not bake bread thor- 
oughly. It should have a decided brown crust on 
each side. 

Always take bread out of the pans as soon as 
done, and lean it against a pan, where the pure 
air can pass around it. Never lay it on the table, 
as it will absorb the odor of the table. If the 
crust gets too hard, wring out a bread cloth (which 
should be a fresh one) in cold water, and wrap 
the bread in it. Never put bread away till cold. 
When warm, it absorbs the air about it, wiiich 
should be pure as from the outside world, if 
possible. 



72 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

An old-fashioned hanging shelf in a dry, clean, 
and well-ventilated cellar, is the nicest place to 
keep bread. It should be kept wrapped in a 
fresh and thick bread-cloth. If you cannot have 
this, or a similar convenience, the next best way 
is to keep it in a stone jar, which should be 
washed in hot water once or twice per week. 

Never let failures discourage 3^ou. No part of 
cooking education is more useful, if turned to 
proper account, than the discipline of. failure. 
The success of bread-making depends on effort 
and experience. These will soon make you skil- 
ful, and you will feel as confident of success as in 
making a cup of tea. You may feel sure there is 
no luck about it. To be successful, care is re- 
quired, as in anything else.

HOMINY AND MILK. 

There are many ancestral dishes which should 
be perpetuated. They should be warmly recom- 
mended to children if we wish to preserve the 
vigor of our race. Hominy is one of the old-time 
preparations which should not be forgotten. 

It should be washed in two or three waters 
as you wash rice. Fine hominy requires four 
measures of water to one of hominy. Put it 
into an inner boiler and allow it to swell for half 
an hour ; then l)oil slowly for three-quarters of an 
hour. Like all mushes, it should be salted very- 
lightly. It is better to put the salt into the water 
before adding the grain. When nearly done, if 
too thin, uncover, and boil till about the con- 
sistency of hasty pudding.

RYE MUFFINS. 

One cup and a half of lye meal. 

One cup of flour. 

Two teaspoonfuls of sugar.

No soda or cream tartar. 

Mix the salt with rye meal and flour Add the 
sugar to the eggs and thoroughly beat them, then 
pour into the flour. Add the milk, bringing it to 
a batter quickly, beating a few minutes longer. 
Bake in stone muffin cups three-quarters of an 
hour or more. Rye cakes require more baking 
than other cake. These are very light and nice. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into dice. When in 
the stew-pan, add cream enough to keep them 
moist, and simmer till hot. They should be of a 
light color. When hot, mix in a little chopped 
parsley and butter. Serve immediately while 
hot.

BAKED SWEET APPLES. 

Put them into a tin gem pan. Bake them in a

retain their form. For breakfast, they must be 
baked the day previous. 

GRAPES. 
"This fruit is a medicine as well as a luxury, 
and should be highly prized. The free use of the 
grape has a most salutary effect upon the system, 
diluting the blood, removing obstructions from 
the liver and kidneys, and enabling the blood to 
circulate in the remotest vessels of the skin, also, 
a healthful effect on that compound affliction, dys- 
pepsia. From two to four pounds per day may 
be eaten with benefit. These remarks apply to 
the fruit when perfectly ripe ; when unripe, like 
all unripe fruit, it deranges the digestive organs."

A BEEFSTEAK 

From the round affords more juice than any other 
cut. If you know how to market (and I am sorry 
to say that housekeepers have to trust too much 
to their provision dealer), select a cut from the 
top of the round, and if not tough you will not 
ask for a nicer, more juicy steak. I have eaten it 
so tender and juicy, that I thought it was a nice 
rump steak. It makes an inexpensive breakfast, 
being much cheaper per pound than other beef- 
steaks. 

BOILED EGGS. 
This, beyond question, is the most popular way 
of serving eggs, for which I give an approved 
French method. Have ready a saucepan of boiling 
water. Place in it fresh eggs. Put on the lid 
of saucepan and set on the stove where it will 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 77 

keep boiling hot, but not boil. Let the eggs 
remain six or eight minutes, or as suits your 
guests. Serve in a napkin, on a dish, folding it 
over to retain the heat, or use a covered egg dish. 

FRIED HOMINY. 

Cook your hominy as in Breakfast ISToo 6. 
Moukl it in a small oblong tin pan. There is a 
size, which will give you slices just square when 
cut. Wet the pan with cold water to prevent its 
sticking. When cold cut in slices nearly an inch 
thick, flour each side, and fry a nice brown, on 
the griddle, in a little butter or sweet drippings. 
It should be cooked the day previous. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

If the system is more or less feverish, and such 
is the case usually with most people, nothing can 
be more refreshing and cooling than ripe straw- 
berries. They are a great preservative against 
the heating influence of meats in hot weather. 
'Tis said that the strawberry is the most whole- 
some of all fruits, being easy of digestion, and 
never growing acid by fermentation on the stom- 
ach, as most other fruits do.

to prevent it from sticking. When the steak 
touches the pan, it adheres, but in a second it 
loosens. Keep it covered, at the same time turn 
it often. Season the usual way. 

Or you can make a nice gravy which many like. 
Into the same pan put half a cup of water. Make 
a smooth thickening of half a teaspoonful of flour,

OVEN-BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

Try this labor-saving experiment, and, like 
others, you may sanction it. Perchance, if not 
apprised, you might not suspect that your steak 
was not gridiron-broiled. To begin, your oven 
must be very, very hot, else you will lose the 
juice of your steak. A moderate oven would ruin 
it, for, to be in perfection, it must be quickly 
seared with heat. Other principles are the same 
as for gridiron-broiling. 

Lay your steak into a dripping-pan large enough 
to hold it without condensing. Set it in a hot 
oven. If thick, it will need to remain ten min- 
utes, according to the doneness you prefer. When 
done, season to taste, and serve on a hot platter.

awakening thought, clearing perception, and pre-

venting drowsiness. But when taken in excess, it 
produces nervous tremblings, the heart beats 
stronger, the pulse becomes more frequent, the 
thoughts wander, and a peculiar state of intoxica- 
tion comes. Beware of an overdose." 

An earthen teapot is more wholesome for 
steeping tea than tin. The water of which it is 
made should always be freshly boiled, and boiling 
hot when added to the tea ; the tea-pot rinsed and 
scalded each time that tea is made. Many a nice 
cup of tea' has been spoiled by not scalding the 
teapot.

Althouirh corned beef hash is verv ancient, it

is much esteemed, and is by no means despised at

There are many ways of spoiling it. First, by 
frying instead of heating it. Second, by dredging 
Hour into it, which imparts a raw taste like dough. 
Third, by using too much water, which makes it 
insipid. Fourth, by using too much fat or gravy, 
which spoils its delicacy. Lastly, by burning it, 
which gives it a bitter flavor. 



96 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 



DELMONICO'S CORNED BEEF HASH. 

Chop cold corned beef rather fine, but not too 
fine. Chop, not mash, about one-third as large a 
quantity of cold boiled potatoes. They are not as 
nice for beef hash when hot, and if either potatoes 
or meat are chopped too fine, your hash will be 
salvy. Have it neither dry nor watery, but moist. 
Cover it close and heat a few minutes. When 
hot, if no gravy has been used, stir into it a little 
butter. Serve on a hot dish. 

Many think the perfection of corned beef hash 
is to chop a boiled beet with it. This is very 
good when made in right proportions and not too 
much beet. You do not need quite as much 
potato when beet is added. In this case you omit 
the pickled beet, and provide a substitute.

satisfy. 

CANNED CORN OYSTERS. 

The inventor of canning has put us in possession 
of green corn every month in the year. Although 



100 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

we cannot perfectly recognize our dainty and 
succulent green corn of summer, yet by largely 
drawing on faith we forget the discount and get 
the whole of that asrreeable veofetable when out 
of season. When made into corn oysters, it is 
graciously accepted at the breakfast table. For 
directions, see corn oysters. 

RAISED WAFFLES. 

One quart of sifted flour. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Nearly a quart of warm milk. 

Half a cake of compressed yeast, 

Or half a cup of liquid yeast. 

One tablespoonful of creamed butter. 

Put the salt, butter, yeast and warm milk into 
the middle of the flour. Mix to a batter, and set 
to rise over night. In the morning, when ready 
to bake, beat two or three eggs, then beat them to 
the batter. Dissolve half a teaspoon of soda in a 
very little warm water and stir throughout at the 
last moment. Heat the waflie irons, butter them 
well, and fill nearly three-quarters full. Brown 
them evenly on both sides. Do not scorch them.

ROAST BEEF AND BARLEY STEW. 

To a pint of cold roast beef when cut into slices, 
add a cup of boiled barley, three or four slices of 
cold boiled potatoes, and a grain of salt. Put all 
into a stewpan with nearly two cups of water. 
Simmer ten minutes. Or you can substitute 
boiled cracked wheat. Very nice. 

COUNTRY GRIDDLE CAKES. 

One pint of sifted flour. 

One teaspoon of salt. 

One scant pint of sour milk or cream. 

One teaspoonful of soda. 

Make a smooth batter of flour and milk. Beat 
this until a lightness is evident. Now dissolve the 
soda in a very little warm water and beat it into 
the batter. Have the griddle hot and greased all

well apart, on the griddle. When the cakes 
bubble all over, slip your griddle-spade under 
each cake and turn quickly. Bake the other side, 
and when done send to the table quickly on a hot 
plate. Send only one batch at a time. They 
should be eaten as quickly as possible from the 
griddle.

FRIED LIVER. 

Fried liver is a favorite with many. It should 
not be strongly urged, yet it is better than no 
meat. Have your beef drippings boiling hot when 
the liver is put into it, or it will soak fat. It 
needs to be well cooked, though not to a crisp, 
which makes it juiceless. 

FRIED APPLES 

Are an acceptable companion for liver. Do not 
pare them, but preserve the form of the slices

with the paring. Add a spoonful of water, some 
of the liver gravy, cover closely and fry without 
stirring. When nearly done, add a little Porto 
Eico molasses.

VENISON BREAKFASTS. 

Deer have the zoological marks which distin- 
guish them from mi wholesome animals, conse- 
quently venison can be eaten with a clear con- 
science. It is toothsome, strengthening, and easily 
digested. 



BREAKFAST No. 24.

Venison Steak. Currant Jelly. 



Rice Waffles. Ripe Fruit. 



Coffee. 

Venison takes a few minutes longer to broil than 
beefsteak. Have your fire clear and hot. Broil 
rapidly, turning often. Observe the same rules 
as for beefsteak, so as not to lose a drop of juice. 
Have ready a hot platter on which are a few bits 
of butter. When done, lay your steak on the 
butter, turning it over and salting it on each side, 
adding a little currant jelly. 



108 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 



RICE WAFFLES. 

One cupful of boiled rice. 

Three eggs. 

One heaping teaspoon of broken butter. 

One saltspoon of salt. 

Two cupsful of sour milk. 

One teaspoonful of soda. 

Separate the grains of rice, cream the butter, 
beat the eggs, and stir those together. Dissolve 
the soda in a very little warm water, which stir to 
the milk and add to the mixture. Stir in flour 
enough to make a thick batter. 

Have the waffle irons hot and greased with 
butter. Fill them three-quarters full. Be careful 
not to burn them. Bake the first side before 
turning.

When beautifully cooked, this breakfast van- 
ishes like a vision. Have venison steaks cut thin. 
Trim off the fat. Mix together, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one of thyme or summer savory, and one 
saltspoon of pepper. Sprinkle this seasoning over 
the steaks, roll them tightly and tie. Lay them 
on a trivet or stand, fitted into a roasting pan. 
Have a hot oven, that the surface may soon sear 
and securely hold the juices. Bake half an hour 
or more. These are quite as nice as sausages, and 
you are certain of what you are eating. 

N. B. — When a dish is repeated, and no refer- 
ence made to it, its directions can easily be found

MUTTON AND LAMB BREAKFASTS. 

Sheep literally fulfil the required terms of the

lamb wholesome and agreeable.

Oatmeal Mush. 
Broiled Mutton Chops. Graham Puffs. 



Baked Potatoes. Sliced Tomatoes.

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS 
Are especially nice when broiled in perfection. 
The gridiron must first be warmed, or the chop 
will stick to the bars. A fine chop is full of juice, 
and none of it should be wasted. The heat of the 
fire should be so great that it will instantly harden 
the outside of the meat so that the juices cannot 



114 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

run out. Never stick a fork into a chop, as it lets 
out the juice. When done, salt, and butter. 
Serve hot. 

GRAHAM PUFFS. 
One cup and a half Graham flour. 
One cup of flour. 
Two teaspoonfuls of sugar. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 
Two liberal cups of sweet milk. 
Three eggs. 

Mix salt with the flour. Beat up a batter with 
the flour and milk. Beat the yolks of the eggs to 
a froth. Beat the whites till stiff". Beat the 
yolks, then the whites into the batter. Bake in 
buttered stone cups half an hour or more. Use 
your judgment and do not keep them in too long. 
When done they will be well popped over. Keep 
the oven closed as much as possible. 

Ignorant cooks often spoil this simple and 
delicate cake by persisting to use baking powders 
or soda. They cannot believe they will rise with- 
out them. 

SLICED TOMATOES. 
These are a favorite complement to chops. 
Select the fairest ripe ones. Scald and peel them. 
When cold, slice them. Dress with vinegar, 
pepper and salt to taste.

rately and thoroughly. Then beat them separately 
to the batter. Fill gem-pans or stone cups a little 
more than half full. Have a quick oven. Some- 
times half an hour bakes them, but often it takes 
more. When done, they will be evenly browned,

FRIED BREADED MUTTON CHOPS. 

This is an admirable breakfast, when served dry 
and hot. Trim off the superfluous skin and fat, 
to give the chops an elegant appearance. Dip 
each chop in beaten egg, then roll it in powdered 
crackers. Meantime, have the superfluous fat 
tried out in a frying-pan, and, when boiling hot, 
lay the chops into it, and fry. Use as little fat as 
possible. 

RAISED GRAHAM MUFFINS. 

Two cupfuls of Graham meal, unsifted. 

One cupful of white flour. 

Two cupfuls of sweet milk or warm water. 

Two tablespoonfuls of Porto Rico Molasses. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Half a cake of compressed, 

Or half a cup of liquid yeast. 



MUTTON AND LAMB BREAKFASTS. 117 

Mix flour, meal, and salt. Scald the milk, and, 
when at blood heat, pour into the middle of the 
flom\ Dissolve yeast, and with the molasses add 
to the mixture. Beat all thoroughly to a batter 
dough. When well mixed, set it in a temperature 
of about sixty-five degrees over night. Graham 
sponge sours more quickly than white, and should 
not rise in so high a temperature. 

Early in the morning, beat it up well, and let it 
rise again. When about to bake, dissolve half a 
teaspoonful of soda in a very little warm water, 
and thoroughly incorporate it with the batter. 
Bake in well-buttered muffin-tins or gem-pans. 
These do not require so hot an oven as white muf- 
fins, but should bake longer. 

BROILED TOMATO. 

Cut each tomato into two slices, without peeling. 
Lay them into a wire gridiron, and broil carefully, 
turning like steak, to keep the juice. Have them 
a nice brown on both sides. When dished, add a 
bit of butter to each. Salt and pepper to taste.

If you try this labor-saving experiment, you 
may conclude that your mutton chops are only in 
perfection when oven-broiled. Trim the chops, 
but not so much as to make them entirely deficient 
in fat. Lay them in a meat-pan, and broil in a 
quick oven. A slow oven would spoil them. Do 
not broil them too long. Season and serve. 

GRAHAM BISCUIT. 

The preceding Graham muffin receipt makes a 
nice biscuit mixture. Observe its full direc- 
tions. The usual failure in Graham biscuit is 
generally caused by kneading in too much flour. 
They should be made less stiflf than white biscuit, 
and kneaded just as soft as possible. Prick the 
biscuit with a fork, to prevent the crust from 
binding.

till all are well mixed. To this, add the salt, mo- 
lasses and yeast, which should be dissolved in a 
little water. Now beat all five or six minutes, and 
set to rise in a warm place, over night. A pitcher, 
is very convenient to fry buckwheats from, which 
should be covered with a thick cloth, over night. 

In the morning beat your batter well and set it 
near the fire for a second rising. Buckwheats are 
not in perfection without soda, which should be 
added whether the cakes are sour or not, but not 
till just before they are baked. When breakfast is 
on the table, dissolve an even teaspoonful of soda 
in a little warm water, stir it well into the batter, 
and bake. Serve them as quick as possible from 
the griddle. 

Indian meal makes buckwheats much more ten- 
der than flour ; they are much better made with 
milk than water.

VEAL. 

The Bible establishes the eating of veal. " And 
bring hither the fatted calf and kill it." 

" And Abraham ran into the herd, and fetched a 
calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young 
man, and he hasted to dress it." 

Beware of eating too young veal. Nowadays 
it is sent to the market very young, for the reason 
that it is not so remunerative as the cow's milk. 
'Tis said many diseases, especially in children, 
come from eating too young veal. In earlier times 
it was thought that veal was not eatable before it 
was four or five weeks old. It is very easy to 
know when it is too young, as the bones are very 
tender and like nerves.

butter. Stir these evenly into the gravy, and 
simmer two minutes before serving. 

CAFE AU LAIT. 

Americans are very ambitious of French names, 
and cafe au lait is being domesticated in their 
kitchens. Its French name sounds new to many, 
yet it is a very ancient method of preparing coffee. 
In bygone days my grandmother, and later my 
mother, when there was milk to spare, often made 
our coffee half milk, which the French call cafe 
au lait.

SCALLOPED VEAL. 

Many think this the best way to serve fragments 
of veal. Chop cold roast or stewed veal very 
fine. Butter a round, deep, baking-tin. Put a 
layer of veal in the bottom, next a layer of pow- 
dered crackers or dry bread. Alternate these 
until the pan is full, having a thick layer of crumbs 
on the top. Moisten each layer with a little of 
the gravy, if any remains from the roast veal, 
otherwise strew tiny bits of butter on each layer 
of veal, and moisten with water. Cover with a 
tin plate. If small, bake nearly half an hour, if 
large, three-quarters. Do not get it so moist that 



VEAL BREAKFASTS. 135 



it will not retain its form, when inverted on a 
platter. The meat and cracker can be prepared 



over night. 



CREAM TOAST. 
Toast bread to a golden brown. Scald your 
milk in a farina boiler. When scalding hot, thicken 
it with a very little corn starch or flour dissolved 
smooth in a little cold water. Do not make starch 
of it. I have eaten it so thick with flour that it 
tasted like starch. Be sure your milk is scalding 
hot, when you add your thickening, which pour 
into the middle of the milk, stirring it gently till 
all is thickened. After simmering till there is no 
raw taste of the flour, add a little butter and stir it 
through the milk. Have your toast ready. Lay 
a few slices on a deep dish, pour over them some 
of the hot cream, then lay on a few more slices 
and pour over again. Lift the lower slices, one by 
one, that the creamy mixture may run between. 
Reserve a surplus to pour over the whole. Serve 
as soon as finished.

OVEN-BROILED VEAL CUTLETS. 
Veal steaks can be broiled in the oven with bet- 
ter effect than over the fire. The oven should be 
as hot as for baking meat, otherwise you will dry 
and spoil them. When oven-broiled, they get 
cooked more thoroughly, and few people are fond 
of rare veal. Lay the steaks in the bake-pan, using 
a very little of the fat, only enough to keep them 
from sticking and scorching. Fit a tin plate closely 
over them, to keep them steaming while baking. 
When done, if there is any fat, drain it from them. 
Season with salt and butter, the same as for other 
broiled steaks. 

CORN-MEAL RAISED MUFFINS. 
One pint of sweet milk, or warm water. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 
One cupful of flour. 
One heaping tablespoonful of sugar. 
Half a cake of compressed yeast. 



VEAL BKEAKFASTS. 137 

Add Indian meal enough to make a thick batter. 
Else over night. In the morning, when ready to 
bake, add half a teaspoon of soda, dissolved in a 
little warm w^ater, and with a tablespoonful of 
melted butter, mix throughout the batter. Bake 
in muffin-tins. Yeast muffins have the advantage 
of soda muffins, as they are not heavy when cold, 
but palatable. 

WATER-CRESS SALAD. 
Like the tomato, this vegetable possesses the 
double quality of food and medicine. " According 
to analysis by M. Chatin, Director of the School of 
Pharmacy, Paris, water-cress contains iron, iodine, 
phosphates, and other salts. As a medicine, it has 
been vaunted for its efficacy in all cases of weak 
digestion, and has been prescribed for scrofula and 
phthisis. For food, it ought to be used in its 
green or uncooked state, in the form of salad or 
without any seasoning."

One cup of white flour. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 
Two spoonfuls of nice molasses. 
Half a cake of compressed, 
Or, half a cup of fluid yeast. 

Stir the milk to the Graham and flour. Add 
salt, molasses, and yeast. Beat all together, and 
rise in a warm place over night. In the morning 
beat well and set near the fire for a second rising. 
When everything is ready for breakfast, dissolve 
half a teaspoonful of soda and stir into it. Bake 
them on a griddle greased only enough to keep 
them from sticking. Bake both sides a nice brown. 
Do not turn them twice. Serve only a few at a 
time. 

These are much more nourishing and wholesome 
than any buckwheat griddles. Those who indulge 
in buckwheat will be wise to substitute Graham.

FOWL. 

The Bible has given no general catalogue of the 
birds allowed for man's food, but has catalogued 
those disallowed, which are birds of prey and 
scavengers of oifal and carrion. Our domestic 
fowl are healthy, when properly cared for, and their 
meat sound and wholesome.

BROILED CHICKEN. 

Chicken for broiling should be split open at the 
back, washed, wiped dry, the breast bone flattened 
with a mallet, and the wings twisted back that the 
breast may show ; beside, a chicken looks very 
badly with the bones and wings sticking out. 
Never broil a fowl that is tough. It would be 



146 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

impossible to make it eatable by broiling ; and if 
sure that it is tender, you may make it more so 
by lirst steaming it twenty minutes. From the 
steamer transfer it to the gridiron, inside down. 
Turn it several times. When broiled a nice 
brown, season with butter and salt. Before 
steamers were used, I have parboiled a fowl pre- 
vious to broiling ; but this process robs it of its 
juiciness. When steamed, it retains its juice, and 
cooks those parts tender which, if only broiled, 
would be so scorched that they could not be 
eaten. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. 

One quart of flour. 

One teaspoonful of soda. 

Two teaspoonfuls of cream-tartar. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Half a cup of creamed butter. 

One pint of rich sweet milk. 

One quart of strawberries. 

Incorporate soda, cream-tartar, and salt well 
into the dry flour. W^ork the creamed butter into 
the prepared flour, fill fine and yellow. Pour the 
milk to this mixture, and mould to a delicate 
dough, which divide into three parts. Eoll each

part quickly half an inch thick. Fit each to a 
Washington-^pie plate and bake at once. 

Meantime, mash the strawberries, addino- suo-ar 
to your taste. Keep them in a cold place till the 
cakes are ready. When the cakes are done, re- 
verse the tin and lay the cake upon it. Take a 
thin sharp knife, dip it into hot water, then wipe 
it dry, and equally split the cakes. Do not split 
them with a cold knife, as it flattens the bread. 
Butter each half ; lay one third of the jam on each 
under crust and cover with the upper crust. Serve 
quickly.

possible. The pan must be dry, so that the chicken 
will brown on the bottom. The secret of success 
is to have the oven just as hot as the chicken will 
bear without burning. It would not be like broil- 
ing, if done in a slow oven. When done, season 
with salt and butter.

Coffee. Ripe Fruit. 

This was a favorite breakfast of my mother's, 
and I well know its merits. For breakfast, 
the chicken should be boiled the day previous, 
unless you are a very early riser. The chicken 
need not be as tender as for broiling. When 
washed and dissected, put into a stew-pan and 
barely cover with warm water. Very cold water 
draws the juice out. Cover and stew slowly till 
tender, but not so much as to drop in pieces. 



DOMESTIC FOWL BREAKFASTS. 149 

If boiled the day previous, heat the liquor with 
the chicken in the morning. When hot, add 
butter and a very little smooth thickening. If the 
chickens are very fat, they will not need the ad- 
dition of butter. After adding the thickening, 
stew gently seven or eight minutes. The addition 
of parsley, cut fine, is considered an improvement 
by some. Serve with the gravy poured over it.

RICE GRIDDLE CAKES. 

One and a half cups of boiled rice. 

Two cups of warm, sweet milk.

Mix soda and cream-tartar with the flour and stir 
to the mixture. If not thick enough, add flour 
till the right consistency. Wipe the griddle each 
time you grease it with a dry cloth. These 
cakes require a longer baking than batter, and 
should be baked of a smaller size. When served, 
do not pile them one upon the other, but spread 
them over the plate. Serve them hot, and of a

SARATOGA POTATOES. 

The potatoes should be nice and sliced with a

nicely peeled and cut '' thin as a wafer " will make 
a large sized dish full. When sliced, put them 
into icy cold water for a few moments to crisp 
them, then between two cloths to dry them. Use 
a deep kettle, as the fat is in danger of spattering 
over when the potatoes are put into it. A Scotch 
kettle is best, and every housekeeper should have 
one for frying. Have the fat hot, or the potatoes 
will soak fat. There should bo as much drippings

CLARIFIED DPJPPIISrGS. 

Claeify means to make pure or clear. The care 
of drippings is a very important item in a family, 
and every housekeeper should know what is done 
with them. An inexperienced cook will not be 
acquainted with the various ways of preventing 
them from being wasted, and if experienced may 
not be inclined to take the trouble unless she is 
looked after. Then there are families who look 
upon drippings as unfit to use, and consign them 
to the waste fat. When properly taken care of, 
they are more wholesome than lard for frying. 
Many persons quite unable to eat articles of food 
fried in lard find no inconvenience from those 
fried in drippings, and they are more convenient 
than lard for frying as they do not splutter and 
spatter over the frying-pan. 

To clarify your drippings or gravy, pour them 
from the meat-pan into a l:)owl, instead of the crock 
in which you intend to keep them. Then pour 
into the bowl a little boiling water. Stir it, and 



166 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

set it away to cool. Next day, or when cold, 
remove the cake from the bowl, sci-ape from the 
bottom of it the impm'ities, put it into a saucepan 
with a little salt and boiling water. Let it set 
half an hour over a moderate hre and simmer. 
Do not hurry it, or it may acquire a burnt taste, 
which you cannot get rid of, and its pureness is 
spoiled. Skim during the process. When cold, 
remove from the water and dregs, scraping off 
whatever adheres to it that looks foreio-n. Melt 
this cake again, as this melting sends out all the 
water. When free from water it will not taint, 
neither spatter, and will keep for months in a cold 
place. Strain it through a sieve, and do not cover 
or put it away till hard. Keep it in a stone crock, 
well covered. 

Earthen absorbs fat, and it becomes tainted, 
smells disagreeably, affecting the flavor of newly- 
added fats, and of whatever is cooked in it. How 
often you see warmed-over potatoes spoiled hy 
keeping the fat in earthen which is soaked with it. 
No matter how clean your earthen vessel is, — you 
cannot scald out the old and tainted fat it has 
absorbed. Beware of tainted bowls, they are 
poisonous, and should be appropriated to the dirt 
barrel. Do not pour fat that has been used for 
frying to the crock that keeps the cakes, but have 



FISH BREAKFASTS. 167 

one for each. Alw.nys let fat that has been used 
pass through a fine strainer when you return it, 
else the sediment will spoil the next frying. 

CLARIFIED BEEF SUET. 

Where frying is very popular, drippings do 
not meet the demand, whicli makes it necessary 
to buy beef suet. This also needs rendering, to 
clear it from skin and veins. The parts around 
the kidneys are best. Cut in small pieces, 
and proceed as for trying lard. Cool in small 
cakes. 

THE PPvINCIPLES OF FRYING FISH. 

Fried fish is very popular and often very con- 
venient, yet very badly performed by many, and 
has more failures than any othar cooking ope- 
ration. 

Although the fishmonger is supposed to have his 
fish clean, yet a clean cook will always rewash it. 
When washed, wrap them in a clean dry cloth, to 
make them perfectly dry. When the cloth has 
absorbed all the moisture, thickly dredge the fish 
with flour, fine oatmeal, or fine crumbs. If crumbs, 
they must be fine, or herein lies a failure. Coarse 
crumbs are liable to drop ofif, and take with them 



168 WHAT TO GET FOE BREAKFAST. 

the fine ones. AYlien salted and dredged, lay on 
a platter in readiness for frying. 

Have a clear and brisk fire. Be sure that your 
frying-pan is perfectly clean. In frying fish be 
particular not to use drippings that are not fresh. 
They will ruin the fish if they have been used for 
amthing else. More fat is required for frying 
fish than for other meats. The drippings must 
literally boil, smoke, and appear on the point of 
burning when the fish is put into it, which at once 
hardens the surface of the fish, so that the fat can- 
not penetrate, and you may feel assured that j^our 
fish will not soak fat, neither will it stick to the 
pan or break. Many suppose if fat luib1)les in the 
pan it is hot enough : but this is not so, and those 
are nearest to the truth who do not drop their fish 
into the fat until it smokes. Fish will be crisp 
and of a o-olden brown when the fat is of the rio:ht 
temperature. 

Have your pan sufiiciently large for the fish to 
lay fiat on it. If cutlets, do not crowd them. Be 
careful not to burn fish or fat. Lastly, bear in 
mind that if fish is thrown into the pan with un- 
melted or partly heated fat it will be spoiled, and 
so soaked vdth fat that it will be unsafe to eat 
it, for it will surely sicken the stomach. If you 
fail, there are four reasons for it. Either vou did 



FISH BREAKFASTS. 169 

not have fat enou2;li or it was not hot enouo^h, or 
your fish not wiped dry enough, or your crumbs 
not fine enough. Closely observe these sugges- 
tions, and failure will not occur.

Smelts are classed by naturalists with the sal-

called '' the dainty of Boston." 

The nicest and only way is to fry them. Open 
them at the gills and press out the insides. Some 
cooks do not remove the inside, but they should, 
for the same reason done to other fish. '^Vash 
them clean, wipe them dry, roll them in meal or 
egg-crumbs. Have 3^our fat boiling hot when the 



FISH BKEAKFASTS. 173 

iish are put into it. Do not sprinkle them with 
salt until they are nearly done, as they will not 
brown as well if salted at the first. Do not crowd 
them, or they will not be crisp and brown ; and 
unless served immediately they lose their crispness 
and flavor. Lay them on a cloth when evenly 
done, for the fat to drain, then serve quickly. 

BREAKFAST TWISTS.

in circumference at the ends than in the middle. 
When each piece is rolled, join one end to each of 
the other two, and braid them loosely together the 
length of the roll. Press the ends together firmly, 
brush them over with milk, and let them rise 
twenty minutes. Set them in a quick over, and 
bake thirty minutes. They can be made smaller 
if desired.

very careful not to let it come to a boil. Boiling 
salt fish toughens it ; but when cooked in hot 
water it can be made tender as chicken. When 
soaked the specified time, drain off all the water, 
adding more boiling water, more or less, to make 
it the moisture you like. Into a heaping spoonful 
of butter incorporate a little flour. Stir this to the

MINCED FISH AND POTATOES. 
What is left from dinner is usually used for 
minced fish. Pick out all the bones and skin the 
day the fish is cooked, as salt fish is not so pliable 
when cold and easier shredded when warm. Chop 
fine. Do not mash, but chop evenly and fine the 
potatoes. Mix both evenly together in the morn- 
ing, also chop potatoes in the morning. Allow 
more or less potato than fish, as you fancj^ Cover 
the bottom of the spider with melted butter, then

I have already given the most popular method

basket before putting them into the hot water, and 
there will be no danger of cracking them. Boil to 
suit your guests. 



198 ' WHAT TO GET FOR BEEAKTAST. 



EAST-WIND GEMS. 

It is not known whether these hygienic breakfast 
cakes are of the days of unleavened bread, or a 
modern invention. You need not fear the east 
wind they may have imbibed, for the hot oven 
coimteracts its mischievous influence, and they are 
not only hygienic, but taste good. Their fibre is 
like nut meats, and you A^ill enjoy giving the teeth 
just the exercise they need when jon are eatinof 
them. 

You are supposed to have baking-irons for these 
gems, else you had better not attempt them. 
Take very cold milk and water, half and half. 
Stir in Graham and wliite flour, half and half, 
Kttle by little, until you have a batter that will 
drop from the spoon and not rtm. It must be 
stiiTcd rapidly, lightly, and thoroughlyj the more 
the better, to incoiporate a large amount of air 
and insure lightness. It needs a strong aiTa to 
cany this into efl<ect. 

Have the gem-pans ready hot in a hot oven. 
This you must be sure about to secure light gems. 
Drop the batter into the hot irons while in the 
oven, or if you are very quick take the irons out 
for convenience. They require a quick oven to 
bake them, else you lose the air they have taken

in, which is a nice point to determine, for the oven 
should bake as fast as it can without burning. 

If you don't succeed this time try again, — keep 
trying and don't give it up. Make your batter a 
little thinner or thicker, your oven a little slower 
or quicker. There is a way, you may feel sure, 
and if you keep trying you will find it out, and 
will be likely to repeat your success often. When 
these culinary curiosities are in perfection they are 
light and puffy, and you have pure unleavened 
bread, with no taste of "emptyings" or soda.

FRIZZLED BEEF. 

Half a pound of smoked beef, shaved very thin,

OMELETS. 

A heavy and scorched omelet is not fit to be 
served. To know just how to create this popular 
breakfast dish, and get it to the table so that it will 
be succulent, juicy, and soft as cream inside, with 
fine and firm outside, requires a little practice to 
make one perfect. 

They should be cooked in a pan made on pur- 
pose, for a large frying-pan allows the omelet to 
spread too much, and a certain thickness secures 
the softness of the inside. Fry them only on one 
side. When the under side is done or browned, 
and the upper side brought to a moderate consist- 
ency, the brown side is to be folded once, or in 
three, as you fancy. 

There are a multitude of receipts for omelets, but 
the principles are the same for all, the difference 
being only in the flavoring. Allow from three to 
five eggs for an omelet ; but never over five for a 
single one, as they do not work well. If more 



204 WHAT TO GET FOR BEEAKFAST. 

eggs are required, two or three omelets should be 
made. For breakfast, they are more delicate with- 
out flavoring.

Break the eggs into a bowl. Beat them slightly ;

egg, and beat together. Do not salt them, as it 
will flatten the omelet. When nearly read}^, have

the pan set on the fire. Put into it about an ounce 
of butter, which is a rounded table spoonful. Be 
careful not to let the butter brown. As soon as it 
is hot, pour in the omelet. When it sets or begins 
to cook, raise it often with the blade of a knife, to 
let the air and butter pass in, which keep it from 
burning. If the heat is right, the whole mass will 
puff up and cook in a minute. 

It is not necessary to wait till the whole is solid- 
ified, as its heat will finish cooking it after it has 
left the pan. When it ceases to be a liquid, turn 
one half upon the other, on a hot plate. Serve 
instantaneously. Hot plates are an absolute ne- 
cessity. If your omelet is perfect, you will find a 
porous material when you put a silver knife 
into it. 

Obs. — An omelet fried in chicken or turkey fat 
is much whiter and nicer than when fried in butter. 
Turkey and chicken drippings should be clarified 
the same as beef drippings.

EXCELSIOR OMELET. 

This breakfast, when in perfection, will entertain 
the most fastidious. If you are given to attempt- 
ing omelets, be wise betimes, and suggest to your 
guests that they delay not this omelet by lingering ; 
for this is uncertain like all others, and does not 
wait. Beat together yolks and whites of five fresh 
eggs, until you can dip them up with a spoon. 
Stir to this one and a half cups of new milk. 
When mixed, pour into a well buttered spider 
already on the fire. Now you do not manage this 
like the ordinary omelet ; but with a spoon instead 
of a knife you toss it from the bottom as the egg 
"sets." Do not toss or dissever it too much, but 
when done, have it look like broken custard. 
When there is no liquid to the egg, turn it quickly

CROQUETTES. 

" Gather up the fragments that remain, that 
nothing be lost." 

This text is quite opportune for those house- 
keepers who do not appreciate the odds and ends 
of food. There are not a few spendthrift house- 
keepers, who never trouble themselves about a 
stale loaf of bread, clean and sweet pieces of meat, 
except to consign them to "the waste," but who 
must have whole and new materials to start each 
meal. Others are content with an unsightly dish, 
rather than exercise their taste and ingenuity in 
making a handsome breakfast dish from homely 
pieces of food. A sensitive and delicate stomach 
is often affected through the day when disappointed 
of breakfast by an unsightly dish, — out of all 
order and shape, — served on the same dish on 
which served before, — a dish of ragged butter 
and broken bread, that had been handled at a pre- 
vious meal ; and for the final dish muddy and 
unsettled coffee. Such a breakfast is anything but 
appetizing, and to some persons absolutely sick- 



214 ^VHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Yet there are those who can produce a handsome 
breakfast from the fragments left from dinner the 
jDrevious day. This economy is practised quite as 
often in homes where economy is not a matter of 
necessity, as where it is necessary, and such break- 
fasts are just as appetizing as new food when 
gotten in a tasteful manner ; but when served in- 
differently are a sheer waste. 

There are various ways of reconstructing food 
to gladden the stomach, among which croquettes 
should hold a place, for they are practical and 
satisfactory. These little culinary productions can 
be made of fragments of cold chicken, turkey, 
lamb, veal, game, fish, potato, and rice. Cold 
veal and chicken are especially nice for croquettes. 
An economical t\nd tasty housekeeper can repro- 
duce, from uninviting fragments, a handsome 
breakfast dish of croquettes.

milk, cream, or gravy to moisten it. When mixed, 
season to taste, mould into pear shape, roll in egg 
and cracker crumbs, and place in a buttered bake- 
pan. Bake each side a nice brown in the oven ; 
or put them into a frying basket and fvj in hot

should be egged and crumbed.

SAUSAGE. 

When made of harmless ingredients, those who 
have unimpaired digestion may occasionally in- 
dulge in sausage ; but as a frequent dish it is not 
to be recommended. To those who value their 
health, yet sometimes tolerate high relish, I would 
suggest sausage made at home under your own 
supervision ; for there are as many good reasons 
for home-made sausage as for home-made bread. 
If you buy your sausage, you know not what you 
eat. Perhaps tainted pork, so highly seasoned 
that you cannot tell of what kind of abomination 
they are made. Your organ of taste must be un- 
usually chemical if it can discover "the hidden 
secret " in this highly seasoned and disguised com- 
bination. 

Sausages made of veal, beef, or lamb, are much 
more wholesome than made of pork. Sausage- 
meat can easily be prepared by housekeepers, and 
it is just as satisfactory as when put into skins.

SAUSAGE CAKES. 

Chop two pounds of lean beef or veal and a 
quarter of a pound of suet very fine. The com- 
mon fault is, the meat is not fine enough. If you 
have not a machine for chopping sausage-meat, 
you will find it more easily chopped, with an ordi- 
nary chopping-knife, when the meat is a little 
frozen. When chopped, season with pepper, salt, 
and sao^e, to vour taste. You can make it in 
small quantities and often, or in larger, and pack 
in a stone jar. When wanted for use, form into 
little flat round cakes, and bake in the oven on a 
tin, or heat in the spider the same as mince. The 
last method is usually satisfactory, and is quite as 
nice as when enclosed in a skin like commercial 
sausao;e ; besides, you have the satisfaction of 
knowing what you eat.

very tight and tie them at each end and in the

may soon sear and securely hold the juices.

into an earthen vessel to let the fat rise and cool. 
Cut the meat from the bones, mince it fine and put 
it into the kettle with the hquor and a little of the

Johnny Cake. Baked Sweet Apples.

Beans are the richest of all vegetables in nour-

little fat and meat a high strengthening compound 
is obtained. '* The founders of New England ate 
bean porridge morning, noon and night, thanking 
their Heavenly Father for it each time." Ph3^siol- 
oofists consider it excellent food for those who have 
to make great use of their muscle, therefore it w^as 
w^ell adapted to their circumstances. There is yet 
a great demand for force and muscular strength, 
and those who are wise will perpetuate the 
muscle making " bean porridge" or stewed beans. 
With an Indian cake it furnishes a very acceptable 
and nourishing breakfast. 



240 WHAT TO GET FOR BEEAKFAST. 

STEWED BEANS. 
The round or pea bean is the best and most deli- 
cate. Pick and wash a pint, or the quantity needed, 
of dried beans. Put them into a kettle with cold 
water. When they have stewed an hour, drain off 
this water and add fresh boiling water. Set them 
where they will simmer, adding more hot water 
when needed. Cook them indefinitely, till thor- 
oughly done ; otherwise they are indigestible and 
unwholesome like other underdone vegetables. 
When nearly done, add a few pieces of uncooked 
steak, roast beef or lamb, cut in squares about an 
inch in size, or a little beef gravy if you chance to 
have it, or a piece of butter. Add sugar and salt 
to your taste. Stewed beans should have plenty 
of juice and not dry like baked beans. In cold 
weather enough can be cooked to last two or three 
days, and the required complement for each meal 
reheated. 

JOHNNY CAKE. 
This cake was originally baked in front of an 
open fire on the hearth of an old-fiishioned fire- 
place. Fireplaces are now superceded by ranges 
and stoves, consequently, our Johnny cake has to 
be baked on the griddle or in the oven, and is not 



ANCESTRAL BREAKFASTS. 241 

quite like its predecessors in flavor, yet it is a de- 
scendant. To make this cake, take 

Two cupfuls of Indian meal. 
A heaping teaspoonful of sugar. 
A saltspoonful of salt. 

Pour to these enough scalding water or scalded 
sweet milk to make a mixture thick enough to re- 
tain its form when moulded in the hand. Let this 
stand half an hour or more. Grease griddle with 
butter. Fit a cake half an inch thick to it. Smooth 
its surface. When nicely browned turn, but just 
before turning, place a bit of butter on the cake to 
keep it from scorching after turned. The heat 
must be moderate. When both sides are nicely 
browned, it can be transferred to a pan and a hot 
oven to finish its crispness, or it can be baked 
entirely in the oven. These are a delicious corn 
cake, when baked long enough to give them the de- 
sired crispy sweetness, and are irresistible to the 
lovers of crust, and crisp Indian cake. Serve hot.

STEWED PEAS. 

In nourishment, peas are of about the same value 
as beans. They are not quite as rich in albumen, 
but contain more starch. Stewed peas, when well 
cooked, is a dish of great nourishing excellence. 
The natural flavor of peas is delicious, and to many 
more palatable than beans. They should be cooked 
slowly in a plenty of water till done. When nearly 
done, add a few pieces of roast beef or mutton 
bones to flavor them. They should be cooked 
previously, and reheated for breakfast.

ANCESTRAL BREAKFASTS. 247 

Dissolve the soda in a little warm water and stir 
into the milk. Thoroughly beat the eggs, which 
add to the milk. Stir into the mixture rye meal 
enough to make a thick batter. In order that these 
famous pancakes be successfully made they must 
be thick enough to drop from the spoon, otherwise 
they will soak fat. They will be nearly round and 
not rough with irregular points if rightly thickened. 
Too many must not be put into the kettle at a time, 
as they rise a great deal and besides are in danger 
of cooling the temperature of the fat too much. 

Have ready a Scotch kettle of hot drippings. 
Dip your spoon into it each time you dip it into the 
batter, that it may slip quickly from the spoon. 
When the pancakes look done, try one with a knit- 
ting needle. If it comes out smoothly, they are 
done and should be taken out with a skimmer. 
They should be a nice brown outside, light and 
well done inside. Graham flour may be substituted 
for rye if preferred.

requiring an accompaniment. Their satisfying 
virtues are still kept in mind by many families.

[An Ancestral Thanksgiving Breakfast. 
Chicken Pie. 



Baked Potatoes. Coffee. 



Baked Sweet Apples. 



This popular and dainty ancestral thanksgiving 
breakfast still holds its place in many families. Its 
accompaniments are few, as it is a breakfast itself. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

For a pie boil the chickens in water enough to 
barely cover them. Skim them. When tender or 
done take them out into a platter and carve them 
the same as if to be served on the table. Eemove 
the skin if very thick. Have ready a deep baking 
dish, lined with a thick paste. Have the dish pro- 
portioned to the quantity of chicken you wish to 
use. Arrange thp chicken so that the same kind of 
pieces may not come out together, when served. 



ANCESTRAL B11EAKFA8TS. 249 



Sprinkle each layer with a little flour and salt. 
Fill the dish nearly full with the liquor in which the 
chickens were boiled, bat not so full as to be in 
danger of boiling over. Cover with an upper paste 
and close the edges very carefully. Bake nearly an 
hour, or till the crust is handsomely done. The 
crust for chicken pie should be twice as thick as 
for fruit pies. Use butter in the licpor if you 
prefer it, 

PASTE FOR CHICKEN PIE. 

One quart of flour. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Two teaspoonfuls of cream-tartar. 

One teaspoonful of soda. 

One pint of sweet milk. 

One cupful of butter. 

Mix these ingredients the same as for short cake, 
avoiding too much flour. This makes a nice and 
tender paste.

ficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith and 
vomit it." — Bible Hygiene. 

"It is not good to eat^oo 7nuc1i honey." — Bible 
Hygiene. 

Honey is a vegetable product. Pure and fresh 
honey, when eaten in moderate quantities, is whole- 
some. The comb is not easily digested. Old 
honey should be eschewed. — Modern Hygiene,

CHICKEN PIE. 

Cook the chicken as for the ancestral chicken 
pie. When done, remove all the meat from the

deep soup plate with a thick paste, made per 
ancestral chicken pie rule. Fill the plate with 
chicken, sprinkle a little flour through it, adding 
butter, salt and some of the liquor in which it was 
boiled. Cover with a thick paste and bake a nice 
bro^Ti. Be sure you brown the under crust. 
Serve with a gravy made from the liquor in which 
the chickens were boiled.

SUNDAY BREAKFASTS. 

In this nineteenth century Sabbath, the clers-y, 
teachers, also hearers, make heavy drafts on their 
brains, and keep the Sabbath at a high pressure. 
Unless their Sunday diet is nourishing and adapted 
to their individual wants, they fiiil to sustain the 
great Sabbath work which is before them. Relio-ion 
and Hygiene demand quietness and freedom from 
care on this day, therefore we should make all the 
necessary preparations on Saturday for Sunday's 
diet that can be made, keeping no one from church 
or depriving them from reasonable rest, — yet that 
the pressing necessities of a-modern Sabbath justify 
an easy, reasonable, nourishing, and warm break- 
fast, who can disallow ? 



256 WHAT TO GET FOE BREAKFAST. 

SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 1. 

Cracked Wheat. 



Beefsteak. Baked Potatoes. 



Biscuit [light as a foam). Coffee. 



Ripe Fruit. 

This nourishing and easily digested breakfast 
is often absohitely indispensable for clergymen, 
vocalists, and teachers. Many think it a task 
to broil a steak on Sunday morning, yet it does 
not appropriate any more time than many warmed 
over breakfasts. The cracked wheat and biscuit 
can be cooked on Saturday. If the biscuit are 
very light, ethereal, they are as nice, some say 
nicer, when re-heated, than new ones. 



SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 2. 

Cracked Wheat. 



Minced Fish and Potatoes. Brown Bread Toast. 



Sweet Pickles. Coffee. 

Ripe Fruit. 

MINCED FISH AND POTATOES. 
Minced fish and potatoes, accompanied with nice 
brown bread toast, is an easy and palatable break- 



SUNDAY BREAKFASTS. 257 

fast. Many housekeepers institute it for Sunday's 
breakfast, as it can be prepared on Saturday, and 
heated on Sunday morning. For directions, see 
Breakfast No. 78. 

BROWN BREAD TOAST. 

Instead of rye mix Graham meal with Indian for 
brown bread. It is thought quite like Boston 
brown bread, and makes superior toast. For 
brown bread toast, see Breakfast No. 80. 



SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 3. 

Oatmeal Mush. 



Fish Balls. Brown Bread. 



Coffee. Ripe Fruit, 

FISH BALLS. 

These are a convenience for Sunday breakfasts 
and usually meet with appreciation. They can 
be prepared on Saturday and heated on Sunday 
morning, and with oatmeal for a prelude, make a 
very substantial breakfast for those who require 
one. 

BROWN BREAD. 

For Sunday's breakfast, use your own favorite 
brown br&.ad, or brown bread toast. 



258 VTKAT TO GET FOR BEEAKTAST, 



SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 4. 



Cracked Wheat. 



Boiled Eggs. Buttered Toast. 



Coffee. Ripe Fruit. 

This is a convenient and nourishing breakfast, 
and can be accomplished in very little time. 



SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 5. 

Cracked Wheat, irith Cream and Sugar. 



Cocoa or Cafe au Lait. 



This is a valuable and delicious breakfast, 
relished by many every morning. For delicate 
persons, cream is of especial value and is often 
digested more readily than milk. A dressing of 
cream and sugar add both to the flavor and nutritive 
qualities of cracked wheat. 



SXJNDAY BREAKFASTS. 259 



BAKED PORK AND BEANS. 

' Tis said that a distinguished American clergy- 
man declined preaching to roast beef and plum 
pudding on Sunday afternoons, — which strongly 
suggests a dull and stupid audience, — and under 
the influence of such an indigestible mixture, un- 
appreciated sermons. Might not the clergy as 
reasonably decline preaching to baked pork and 
beans on Sunday forenoons, for it is allowed that pork 
is the most indigestible of all meats, besides being 
unscriptural ? Just enough of easily digested food 
leaves all the faculties clear and energetic, there- 
fore may we not conclude that our conceptions are 
more or less influenced on the Sabbath by this 
indigestible breakfast? Do not lessons from ex- 
perience prove that an easy, nourishing, and readily 
digested breakfast is the right one for Sunday ? 



2 GO WHAT TO GET FOR BEEAKFAST. 

SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 6. 

Cracked Wheat. 



Baked Beef and Beans. Brown Bread. 



Coffee. Ripe Fruit. 

CRACKED WHEAT. 
The reason for introducing cracked wheat as a 
prelude to the '' iiTesistible " baked beans, is to 
prevent their excessive use on Sunday morning. 
A hearty breakfast of baked beans produces drow- 
siness with many. Physiologically, beans are not 
brain-inspiring, but excellent for those workers 
who make great use of their muscles, while no 
article is equal to wheat cereals for the nourishment 
of the brain. TThy not institute a dish of cracked 
wheat for Sunday's breakfast, preparatory to beans ? 
With a dressing of sugar, cream, or milk, it is 
charmino;. It can be steamed on Saturday, and 
reheated on Sunday morning. 

BAKED BEEF AND BEANS. 
I am well aware that the devotees of baked pork 
and beans may feel a personal injury at the inno- 
vation made on their time-honored Sunday break- 
fast. I confess there is not a more convenient 
dish for Sunday's breakfast than baked pork and 



SUNDAY BREAKFASTS. 261 

beans ; for they can be cooked on Saturday and 
reheated on Sunday morning. Notwithstanding 
this, the unwholesomeness of pork should be a 
sufficient excuse for substituting another com- 
panion. Baked beef and beans are just as con- 
venient for Sunday's breakfast, and many think 
quite as savory. 

Instead of pork, select the same quantity of 
fresh beef, not deficient in fat, — more or less, as 
3^ou prefer. You will have to learn from experi- 
ence the quantity of beef that will render it most 
palatable. Prepare the same as pork and beans, not 
omitting the preservative element, salt. Try this. 

When corned beef is sweet and nice, some think 
it preferable to fresh beef ; but you incur a risk by 
using it, as sometimes it is kept too long before 
corned, and imparts an objectionable flavor to 
] jeans. 

BROWN BREAD. 

This accompaniment to baked beans is made 
absolutely necessary by the law of the palate. 

Two cupfuls of Indian meal. 

Two cupfuls of Graham meal. 

One teaspoonful of soda. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Half a cupful of molasses. 

Half a cake of compressed yeast. 



262 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Do not scald Indian meal if sweet and fresh. It 
wiU be lighter if not scalded. Thoroughly mingle 
the salt, soda, and dry meal. Pour the molasses 
into the middle of the meal. Mix with warm water 
to a smooth batter about as thick as Johnny cake. 
In the summer this should not be made over night, 
as it rises quicker than other bread. For Sunday 
morning, it can be raised Saturday forenoon and 
steamed in the afternoon. AVhen sufficiently light, 
put the mixture into a well-greased bread boiler. 
Do not quite fill it, but leave room for the meal to 
swell. Cover both boiler and steamer and boil 
steadily for four and a half hours. At the end 
of this time, take the boiler out of steamer, remove 
the lid, and set in a hot oven for half an hour, to 
dry off, and form a tender crust. To be nice it 
must be hot, and should be reheated on Sunday 
morning.

PEEFACE. 



The writer sends this Breakfast Repertory on 
its mission with the earnest hope that it may aid 
housekeepers in answering that oft-repeated ques- 
tion — 

What shall we have for Breakfast? 

Every little while the good housekeeper gets 
into inextricable difficulties with this vexed ques- 
tion, and what to get for this meal seems to em- 
barrass her more than to arrange for two or three 
dinners* Knowing that this general complaint of 
breakfast difficulties exists, the writer hopes to 
succeed in producing a directory that will help 
these perplexities of the most important meal of 
the day, and suggest over one hundred practical 
breakfast bills of fare, adapted to various persons 
and circumstances. 



10 PREFACE, 



To the young housekeeper who has entered upon 
her new duties without experience ; to those whose 
breakfasts are stereotyped after one fashion, and 
of which they heartily tire, these suggestions may 
prove of service. I have endeavored to make 
each plan so plain that a novice can work with 
certainty of success. 

Besides furnishing this extensive collection of 
breakfast fares, the writer aims to convince house- 
keepers of the evil effects of neglecting this meal ; 
also, of the benefits resulting from a warm and 
nutritious breakfast. 

Each breakfast I have endeavored to suggest on 
common-sense principles ; have made nourishment 
the chief aim of eating ; have avoided provoking 
the appetite beyond nature ; have ignored nothing 
but what is absolutely unfriendly to health, and 
have advised each fare in a practical manner, so 
that the stomach may not be offended. 

I have aimed to inspire a respect for made-over 
dishes, which are sometimes so convenient for this 
meal, but which are served by many housekeepers 
in such an indifferent manner that the stomach 
takes offence, but which by patience and skill can 
be made appetizing. 



PREFACE. 11 



My motto will be, never to attempt too much, 
but ever bear in mind that it is not the multiplicity 
of dishes, l^ut the excellent and life-giving qualities 
of a breakfast that vitally concern a family ; that 
a few wholesome and well-cooked dishes are more 
satisfying, and preferable to many indifferently 
cooked. 

Only home-made food will be patronized, as it is 
of vital importance that every article of food in-: 
troduced at the table should be pure ; and to avoid 
hurtful admixtures, a personal inspection of its 
preparation is important, else we know not what 
we eat in this age of adulteration. 

A rigid adherence to the combination of each 
fare is not urged, but to deviate as circumstances 
dictate, and from each one to contrive and invent 
for yourselves as convenience requires, yet making 
it a matter of study to serve together dishes which 
are especially suited to each other. Be assured 
you will derive much benefit from the experience 
of combining and contriving for yourselves. 

To have your favorite breakfasts in memoran- 
dum is sometimes a great convenience in cases of 
absence, sickness, or otherwise. For recording 
them each division is interleaved.

No directory for the morning meal has yet been

I. 

I. REASONS FOR A GOOD BREAKFAST. 

I OFFER the opinion of an experienced and sue- 
oessful physician, whose protection I shared at an 
early age, and by whom I was scrupulously re- 
stiicted from early morning walks, before break- 
fast, — a custom then lunong juveniles, it being the 
prevailing opinion that the early morning air was 
the healthiest, most bracing, and purest. He did 
not agree with the boarding-school theory which 
prescribed long walks before breakfast as a means 
of promoting health, — but ever argued the con- 
trary as the fact, — that languor and exhaustion 
were sure to follow such exeroise, especially w^hen 
taken by persons of delicate organization or those 
liable to sudden colds. Assured that many con- 
sumptions and other diseases were contracted from 
the exposure of an empty stomach to the damp 
and poisonous influence of the morning air, he 
eter counselled those whose vocation called them 



16 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

out early to first brace up the stomach with a 
warm and nourishing breakfast, for at no period 
of the day was the air more tainted than at sun- 
rise, in which it was a dangerous risk to take much 
exercise before the stomach had been fortified with 
a warm breakfast. 

Breakfast, coming after the longest fast in the 
twenty-four hours, should supply the great waste 
that goes on from supper till dinner. In this 
country this, meal consists frequently of tea, coffee, 
and a small proportion of bread and butter. This 
is not enough for those who need a breakfast for 
muscular exertion or real activity. It does not 
give the strength that is needed to last until din- 
ner, and the system is sure to suffer. It only 
allays the appetite, and is insufficient for the sup- 
ply of bodily waste during the long • interval 
betweeA supper and dinner, — perhaps a late one. 
As in pecuniary matters, when the outlay of the 
body exceeds the income, we may be sure the day 
of retribution will come, — that we shall sooner or 
later suffer. 

Those who go to their calling early should not 
only be fed with a nutritious breakfast, but should 
be served in sufficient season, that they may not 
eat hurriedly or insufficiently. Should we allow 
our cattle or horses to start out for half a day 



REASONS FOR A GOOD BREAKFAST. 17 

. . « ■ . 

without being properly fed, we should stand a 
chance of hearing a remonstrance from philanthro- 
pists on "cruelty to animals." Can we work on a 
worthless breakfast more than they ? We should 
fitly feed our hungriness, for energy and morality 
have a great deal to do with what we are fed. 

A good breakfast is of vital importance to the 
temperance public. When our food sustains us 
properly, we do not have that " sinking feeling " 
which compels manjr to seek in the dram-shop that 
power which they igkorantly think can be obtained 
to give them the required strength to perform their 
work. We may be assured that real strength can 
be secured from the right kind of food and cook- 
ery, which means, in plain discourse, that a plenty 
of pure, nourishing, and well-cooked food will 
supply us with all the stimulation and strength we 
require, and are a safeguard against lager beer 
and whiskey. "Poor rations are demoralizing, 
and drive many to intemperance. When man 
does not get the stimulating nourishment which 
his nature craves, he becomes demoralized, and 
resorts to the dram-shop to supply the want of 
good and stimulating food."

11. WHAT ANIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 

The Bible's bill of animal food for man's, diet is 
the best, purest, most delicate, and most popular 
that has^ver been introduced, all civilized people, 
with few exceptions, living up to it (many unwit- 
tingly, though ?). How fortunate that God decided 
the animal food question. He well ' knew what 
animal food was unsanitary, and quickly foresaw, 
that if man was left unrestrained in this matter, 
great confusion and fatal consequences would re- 
sult. Had no danger existed, there would have 
been no need of an exact and imperative prohibition 
and allowance, wherein has been established more 
complete sanitary eating than physiologists could 
have effected for ages, had they been the author. 
Without this Bible restriction of animal food, 
it would have been no easy matter for them to 
convince man that he could not eat of any 
kind of flesh in the animal kingdom that pleased 
him. 

That God intended for man to eat animal food 
is evident from the plain directions which He 
has given. His instructions are, that the animals 
to be eaten by him must be pure, and allows only 



WHAT ANIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 19 

those for his diet that are fastidious eaters, and 
require for their subsistence clean and vegetable 
food, which makes their flesh pure, wholesome, 
delicate, refined, dainty, and easily digested. 
Can any one fail to see the wisdom, carefulness, 
i. and hygiene in God's allowance of animal food for 

His people found in Lev. xi. and Deut. xiv. ? 
Surely, He cares for our bodies as well as for 
j our souls. For convenience, I copy hereinto the 

I catalogues of wholesome and unwholesome ani- 

mals recorded in the Bible. 



Wholesome Animals. 

''And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, 
saying. These are the beasts which ye shall eat 
among all the beasts that are on the earth. 
Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, 
and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye 
shall eat," 

" These are the beasts wliich ye shall eat. ^ The 
ox, the sheep, and the goat, the hart, and the roe- 
buck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and 
the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois, and 
every beast that parteth the hoof and cheweth the 
cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat." 

*' These shall yc cat of all that are in the waters. 



20 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Whatsoever hath scales and fins m the waters, in 
the seas, in the rivers, them shall ye eat." 

There can be no doubt but this category of fish 
for food by Moses is the most wholesome. They 
are not very oily, but delicate and easily digested. 
The Great Naturalist's zoological marks so plainly 
discriminate the wholesome from the unwhole- 
some animals, that the eye of the unlearned can 
readilv make the distinction. 

No general catalogue is given in the Bible for 
wholesome birds, yet the same principle is ob- 
served as for quadrupeds, — they must subsist on 
clean food. " Of all clean birds ye may freely 
eat." 

Unwholesome Animals. 

The Bible plainly teaches that the animals which 
the orreat Law-o^iver forbade man to eat are not 
clean eaters, but live on carrion and prey, eating 
their food in filth, which makes their flesh un- 
wholesome and not fit for man's food. 

"Nevertheless, ye shall not eat of them that 
chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof, as 
the camel, because he cheweth the cud but divideth 
not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. And the 
hare and the coney, for they chew the cud, but 
divide not the hoof, therefore they are unclean 



WHAT ANIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 21 

unto you. And the swine, though he divide the 
hoof, yet he cheweth not the cud, he is unclean 
unto you ; ye shall not eat their flesh." 

"Whatsoever hath no fins and scales, in the seas 
and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, 
and of any living thing which is in the watei'Sy 
they shall be an abomination unto you ; ye shall 
not eat of their flesh." 

Unwholesome Birds. 

Carnivorous birds, as well as quadrupeds, are 
forbidden. *'And these are they which ye shall 
have in abomination among the fowls, they shall 
not be eaten. The eagle, and the ossifrage, and 
the osprey, and the vulture, and the kite after his 
kind, and the owl, and the nighthawk, and the 
cuckoo, and the great and the little owl, and the 
swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and 
the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the 
lapwing, and the bat. All fowls that creep, going 
upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you." 

Creeping Things. 

** These also shall be unclean unto you among 
the creeping things that creep upon the earth. 
The weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after 
his kind, and the ferret, and the chameleoUy and 



22 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

the lizard, and the snail, and the mole, and every 
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, it 
shall not be eaten." 

" This is the law of the beasts, and the fowl, 
and of every living thing that moveth in the 
waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon 
the earth." 

The laws for animal food hold a very prominent 
part in the revelation given to Moses. Wonder- 
fully few accessions have been made by succeeding 
generations to his list of edible animals, and with 
only a few exceptions his animal food laws have 
been kept by all subsequent civilized people. 
Only starvation would tempt a civilized man to 
accept a slice of turkey-buzzard, dog, cat, or 
horse (although the latter is one of the most 
fastidious feeders). These animals, with many 
others that shock the palate, were not any more 
forbidden, or held in greater aversion by Moses, 
than swine's flesh. Yet many of us, in this en- 
lightened Christian age, in this triumphant civil- 
ization of the nineteenth century, are living in a 
senseless disregard of one of Moses' animal food 
laws, and of all the animals forbidden none have 
been so persistently eaten by Christians as swine's 
flesh ! 

To the reader it must be plain that swine were 



WHAT ANIMAL FOOD TO EAT. 23 

no more forbidden by the law than other un- 
wholesome animals, but that the greater sensation, 
then as now, was produced by the people's per- 
sistence in eating them. Their physical record now 
stands worse than ever, and if they were human, 
the popular anti-fat remedy Avould be at once 
advised. Surely, pork is now fearfully dangerous, 
and our latest medical advices agree with Moses, 
the law-giver, in disallowing it. . 

That good and faithful Physician, who is wiser 
than any of us, well understood the hygienic 
bearings of animal food, when He allowed only 
the flesh of those animals for man's diet that was 
the least trying to his stomach and health. From 
his hygienic meat laws we learn the general prin- 
ciples of diet, — that whatever we eat and drink 
should be pure and «asy of digestion ; likewise, 
that the safest way is to eat and drink on these 
Bible principles. 

Although pork is largely used throughout all 
Christendom, yet I cannot judiciously give it a 
place in this breakfast directory. There will be 
no danger of starvation if it is dispensed with. 
The world is full of good things, so we can easily* 
repudiate it. Just as good, and much more 
wholesome dishes can be gotten without it. No 
baked beans, d la New England, no pork sausage. 



24. WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

no lard, no " delicate cured hams," no frogs' legs, 
" because they taste like chicken," and no other 
animal food will be introduced, that is not included 
in Moses' catalogue of wholesome animal food. 

Fats. 

When God created the human stomach. He 
knew just what machinery to place in it, and 
there is no better evidence of the need of fat as 
fopd than that furnished by nature, which has pro- 
vided the pancreatic juice for the special purpose 
of its digestion. For hundreds of years man 
could not divine how fat was digested. After 
much laborious study, he has lately found out that* 
God planned the 'pancreas at the first for its diges- 
tion. The coarse sort of fats, such as train and 
goose oil, pork and lard, should be eschewed, . 
being very trying to most stomachs. It is allowed 
by physicians that the delicate fats found in beef, 
mutton, fowl, eggs, butter, cheese, milk, and del- 
icate fish afford all that is necessary to maintain 
the animal heat and working power of the body, 
ordinarily. These, too, should be used wisely — 
only what our wants require, it being a matter of 
individual peculiarity, some being able to digest 
more fat than others. 



WINTER AND SUMMER BREAKFASTS. 26 



III. WINTER AND SUMMER BREAKFASTS. 



The two great divisions of food are nitrogenous, 
or flesh-forming, and carbonaceous, or heat-giving. 
Sub-divisions are made by physiologists, but these 
two cover the ground sufficiently for this purpose. 
Fix in your mind that the nitrogenous articles of 
food produce blood and flesh, and that the non- 
nitrogenous or carbonized, produce heat, and j'^ou 
will have a key that will unlock many of the 
mysteries of diet. Our food contains more or 
less of these elements. Some have no nitrogen, 
some no carbon, and some both properties in va- 
rious proportions. 

Winter Breakfasts. . 

The three kinds or classes of food, the special 
oflSce of which ia to support animal heat and 
produce fat, are the oils, the sweets, and the 
starches, and these have little or no influence in 
promoting strength, muscle, or endurance. Fat 
is one of the most powerful agents in the produc- 
tion of animal heat. 

From this we learn that the object of eating is 
to strengthen and keep us warm. Carbon, or 



26 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

charcoal, when burned in our grates, gives out 
heat. When taken into the system, in the form 
of food, the burning process that it undergoes 
there gives to us a warmth which is called vital 
heat. It keeps up the fire of life. It is this 
which sustains human life, and it must be pro- 
duced by the internal combustion of the carbona- 
ceous elements of the food we eat. In vain 
would the softest seal-skin or blanket enwrap our 
bodies without that warmth which comes from 
within. 

Consequently, the keener the cold weather, the 
more carbonized or heat-producing food we re- 
quire to keep up the fire of life. On a sharp 
winter's morning, the breakfast we eat decides 
our eflSciency for execution through the day. 
The heating material taken at supper has been 
appropriated during the night, and if the system 
is not supplied by a carbonaceous, as well as a 
nitrogenous breakfast, our whole being will be so 
badly influenced through the forenoon, that neither 
the dinner nor the supper will repair it ; but when 
properly fed, with food containing both these ele- 
ments, such as meats, grains, fats, sweets, and 
starch, our vital action will be sustained in full 
force, so that we can work vigoi-ously for at least 
five hours before another reinforcement of strength 



WINTER AND SUMMER BREAKFASTS. 27 

and warmth from food is needed. We all know 
that, so long as a person feels cold all through his 
body, no work is done to advantage. As the cold 
weather approaches, it is absolutely necessary that 
we gradually change the cooling breakfast of the 
hot weather to a more nutritious and heat-pro- 
ducing one — more meats, fats, sweets. 

• 

Summer Breakfasts. 

Were we to pursue the plan of eating the heat- 
producing breakfasts in summer which we found 
beneficial to our well-being in winter, a highly 
feverish state of blood would be produced, and 
inflammatory diseases created. In the spring, a 
gradual change in the nature of diet is necessary. 
Less fats, sweets, and starch, as in fine flour, are 
needed. Continue the muscle-making food, such 
as the darker portion of grains, milk, lean meats, 
fowl, and fish. Fish contain a small proportion 
of heating power, and in summer are well adapted 
to the wants of the system. Banish from your 
breakfast buckwheat cakes and molasses. Use 
more of the entire product of the grain (except 
the hull) . Use the early salads and cooling vege- 
tables which succeed each other in . their season. 
The delightful berry and melon, which contain no 
carbon at all, should be freely eaten at breakfast. 



28 WHAT TO GET FOR BEEAKFAST. 

Those who pursue this plan feel no real loss of 
health, and find it for more agreeable than drugs 
and doctors' bills. 

Physiologies are now plenty. They furnish us 
with a knowledge ' of the elements of the human 
bpdy. Their tables, showing the nature or ele- 
ments of both the animal and vegetable diet de- 
signed for the subsistence of man will give one a 
new sense of the relation of food to health. 



THE GENUINE BREAKFAST. 29 



IV. THE GENUINE BREAKFAST. 

How pleasant those homes where genuine break- 
fasts are appreciated ; where cooking morality 
is of importance, and the food is aesthetically 
prepared. Feeling assured of a satisfying bill of 
fare, with what cheerfulness the family respond to 
the news of the morning repast. Who can deny 
the comforts, luxury ^ and moral benefit of this 
meal in one's own cheerful breakfast-room, where 
the cutlets are sweet to the senses, the baked pota- 
toes dainty and mealy, the biscuits of an ethereal 
nature ; where the coffee is fragrant and delicate, 
and possessed of such charms that spirituous bev- 
erages have no temptation; where the cream 
comes safely from the cow to the pitcher; and 
where each dish brings health and pleasure. 

Such a breakfast is absolutely perfect, because 
attractive, wholesome, nutritious, simple, and 
easily digested, leaving the stomach comfortable, 
the head so clear, the spirits so light, and the 
vital forces so supplied that amiable visages, clear 
financiering, speculation, and imagination are the 
speedy compensation. Beside, the stomach, when 



30 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

in this beautiful condition, is a moral force; and 
if (as is sometimes said) many of the evils of 
the world are traceable to bad and scanty food, 
with this kind of breakfast one should not fail to 
be a better man or woman throughout the day. 



THE COUNTERFEIT BREAKFAST. '31 



Y. THE COUNTERFEIT BREAKFAST. 

A HOME without a good breakfast — how shall 
we describe it? Instead of the sunny courtesy 
with which a man comes to a faultless breakfast, 
he who has no assurance of a satisfying morning 
repast, comes like a man who has had bad news 
broken to him, and most likely with a " breach of 
peace " pictured on his face. Yet, if this man had 
the same assurance of an attractive breakfast of 
which the courteous one was confident, he might 
have excelled him in politeness. 

Pity the sorrows of those who are not especially 
favored with a genuine breakfast, that stimulates 
the body, lightens the spirits, clears the thought, 
gives moral force, and recompenses by generally 
resisting the foes of life, for he who is badly and 
scantily fed in the morning has not the moral 
safeguard through the day of him who has been 
well fed at breakfast. 

When so much depends on this meal, is it not 
surprising that so many treat it indifferently ? A 
broiled beefsteak, a digestible breakfast-cake, a 
dainty baked potato, a clear cup of coffee, are 
especial wonders in many families, who have 



32 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

never dreamed that a square and satisfying break- 
fast has much to do with the prosperity of humanity. 
In this enlightened republic, instead of breaking 
fast with a plenty of simple and nourishing food, 
how many begin the labors of the day with a scanty, 
unattractive, and indigestible breakfast, which 
exhausts instead of supplying the forces ! 

Bacon or pork served swimming in grease, 

— steak fried or broiled till the life has gone out 
of it, and consequently so tough and hard that one 
could eat and enjoy a side of leather about as 
easily, — cold potatoes warmed over in fat that 
suggests the longevity of both fat and the vessel 
in which it was preserved, — a hastened corn-cake 
so rank with soda that the stomach is made un- 
happy through the day, — a choice mutton-chop 
transformed beyond recognition, — muffins burned 
to a cinder, by forcing them with too hot an oven, 

— scrambled eggs, and griddle-cakes made leath- 
ery for want of promptness, — the coffee, alas! 
for that precious cup, that benefactor of mankind, 
so invaluable to many for its gentle stimulating 
ix)wers, and especially designed for sustenance 
instead of dangerous wine, — this indispensable 
comfort so muddy and bitter that you cannot 
recognize its first principles ; and to complete its 
transformation, the milk served in an unsanitary 



THE COUNTEKFEIT BREAKTAST. . 33 

pitcher! These are familiar breakfasts in many 
families. 

Dangerous breakfasts these. They do not fitly 
feed hunger. The hungry body vainly tries to 
recuperate in its eflForts to digest this wretchedly- 
cooked food not " convenient '* for it, so that what 
might have been done had the food been rightly 
cooked, remains undone. Determination, appli- 
cation, and patience will enable one to serve a 
very different morning meal, with a little earlier 
rising, if necessary, for a breakfast gotten in "no 
time " usually drifts its own way. 

There is much truth in those old proverbs 
which say that "necessity knows no law," and 
that "hunger will make a hungry monkey eat 
pepper." This land is flowing wiWi whiskey 

• 

and lager. He who has not been fitly fed at 
breakfast is unsafe, for before noon the inward 
craving is sure to make a demand, which must 
be satisfied; and the saloons become an easy 
resort for eking out a poor breakfast. A man 
disappointed in this meal can easily console his 
hunger with something to drink. Breakfast was 
insuflScient tt) give him strength; he must have 
something to make up the want, and he foolishl\' 
believes he can quickly get it from a glass of 



34 AVHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

whiskey or beer, which gives him spasmodic 
strenirth for a brief time, but when the reaction 
comes leaves him worse off than ever. Is it not 
wise to teach that a breakfast unfailingly good, 
with all the elements that stimulate and nourish 
the body, has its moral as well as physical 
benefit ?

MEASURES, SODA AND SOUS MILK. 37 



n. 

MEASURES. 

The measures for this breakfast book are half- 
pint cups, tea and table spoons. As these vary in 
size, the safest way is to have one particular cup 
and spoon for cooking measures, which have been 
proved by a sure standard. 

For a cupful the ordinary breakfast-cup is used, 
that holds half a pint. 

Two cupfuls mean a pint. 

A cupful means half a pint. 

A teaspoonful means just rounding full and not 
heaped. 

SOPA AND SOUR MILK. 

Great numbers who profusely use soda, for light- 
ening bread, are ignorant of its iHtture, and not 
aware that it is ruinous to the human stomach 
when not neutralized by an acid. When the soda 
and acid are used in just the right proportions to 
neutralize each other, they are not considered in- 
jurious to health, provided they are pure. 

In olden times sour milk was exclusively used 
for neutralizing soda.* In later times cream-tartar 



38 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

has been much used instead, as a greater conven- 
ience. At present it cannot be depended upon, on 
account of its adulteration ; consequently, cautious 
people are falling back on sour milk again, feeling 
confident of its purity. Meantime, somehow, 
many have lost the knack of compounding soda 
and soiir milk as accurately as their predecessors, 
who never used too much, neither too little soda, 
but always the right quantity. My mother's table 
was always furnished with some kind of sour-milk 
bread, which was invariably the same, — always 
just right. 

AN OLD-SCHOOL HOUSEKEEPER 

will tell you that this chemical operation should 
be performed with caution, demanding knowledge 
and care ; also, that the safest way is to use 
smoothly-loppered or nicely soured milk instead 
of partly soured, the exact proportions being one 
teaspoon of soila to one pint of soiir milk. 

Should you have to resort to milk when only 
partly soured, the exact amount of soda now de- 
pends on the acidity of the milk, and you cannot 
so accurately proportion your soda as for nicely 
soured or loppered milk or cream-tartar, which is, 
or should be, always the same. The safest way 
now, is to add a part of the measure of cream- 



SODA AND CREAM-TARTAR. 39 

tartar to your milk that you would use for the 
same quantity of sweet milk. The addition of 
this to the partly soured milk will make it the 
right acidity for the usual measure of soda. You 
cannot use the whole measure of cream-tartar, 
which is two teaspoonfuls to a pint of sweet milk, 
as the measure of soda (one teaspoonful) is only 
enough to sweeten a paii; of each acid. This 
mode relieves you of guessing, which many adopt 
who have not the skill of guessing just right the 
required amount, and usually err by getting an 
overdose of soda ; hence the effect, — cakes of a 
golden hue, smelling strong of soda. 

In the receipts for sour-milk breakfast-cakes, I 
would have it distinctly understood that I have 
adopted the following rule as a general one : 
One teaspoonful of soda to one pint of nicely 
soured or loppered milk. 

* 

SODA AND CREAM- TARTAR. 

Pure cream-tartar and soda have no equal for 
making convenient breakfast-cakes. For very 
small cakes, such as griddles, muffins, waffles, 
and various breakfast-cakes, it is quite usual to 
lighten them with these ingredients ^ by adding 
both in a dry state, finely pulverized, to the flour, 
and sifting them with it. The acid and soda 



40 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

readily unite and produce the desired gas for 
lightening the bread. This is now considered the 
better and surer way, as the success of these light- 
ening ingredients depends on their equal distribu- 
tion throughout the flour. When thoroughly 
incorporated with the flour, you avoid finding 
those lumps of soda in various parts of the bread, 
which give it a yellow color and disagreeable 
flavor. To neutralize each, use one teaspoonful of 
soda to two of cream-tartar. These proportions 
have been accurately allowed by chemists. ^ 

HOME-MADE YEAST. 

f It is a convenience to know how to make good 
yeast when you cannot buy it. K you have not 
sweet old yeast to start the new with, you can 
create some by making of flour and water a thin 
batter, and letting it stand in a warm place till 
fermented. This will be as efiective as old yeast 
for starting the new and fresher, giving a sweet 
and pleasant flavor to the bread. When yeast is 
entirely new, you. get sweeter bread than when 
started with old and half-decayed yeast, which 
produces an unpleasant flavor with a certainty. 
When it has a tart smell and a watery appearance 
on the surface it is too stale to use. 

Home-made dried yeast-cakes are not reliable, 



HOME-MADE YEAST. 41 

and do not make bread of the first quality. 
Potato yeast is reliable, and considered better 
than that made in the' usual way. The dough 
made from it does not sour as readily, but will 
remain perfectly sweet until it has increased twice 
the original quantity, requiring a little extra time 
for rising. Bread made from this yeast is sweet, 
light, and does not dry quickly. Yeast made 
from the following receipt will keep four weeks in 
hot weather, in a cold place : — 

Two quarts of water. 

One cup of hops. 

Four good potatoes. 

One cup of sugar. 

One dessert-spoon of ginger. 

Half a cup of salt. 

Boil the hops half an hour in the two quarts of 
water. Peal, boil, and mash the potatoes very 
fine. Strain the hop-water through a fine strainer 
and mix with the potato, sugar, ginger, and salt. 
When blood-warm stir in a cupful of sweet and 
lively yeast, or a cake of compressed, dissolved in 
warm water. ' Keep it covered in a warm room 
five or six hours, when it is usually sufficiently 
effervesced. While getting light give it a good 
beating several times. When sufficiently light,

pour it into sweet glass jars, cork tight, and keep 
it in a cool cellar or place. 

Less sugar and salt may be used in 'cold weather, 
as these are designed to arrest excessive fermenta- 
tion. The ginger is intended to keep the yeast 
from souring. The quantity directed does not 
affect the flavor of the bread. Some use flour to 
thicken yeast, but it will keep longer without. 
Those who have once used these directions are un- 
willing to relinquish them. 

BREAKFAST PARES. 

Breakfast is usually quickly and hurriedly pre- 
pared, requiring undivided attention. For a cook 
to worry her brain trying to think of half a 
dozen or more diflerent dishes for this meal, seems 
a serious mistake. Commonly, three or four 
nicely-cooked dishes after the grain course will 
answer better in every way. In the following 
bills of fare for breakfasts, this number of newly- 
cooked dishes is suggested, which will greatly 
lessen the labor of the housekeeper, and save her 
from that disapproving conscience which she is 
sure to experience when a greater number is at- 
tempted, and the result is an array of half-spoiled 
dishes. 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 43 

Each bill of fare oflfers all the chemical elements 
required for nutrition, consisting usually of vege- 
table and animal food, leaving the quantity to be 
regulated by the appetite and individual necessity. 
Each dish is plainly prepared, so that the distinc- 
tive characteristics of the food may be retained. 
In the temperate zone instinct demands a varied 
diet adapted to the rapid changes of the climate. 
The different bills of fare suggested, give the in- 
dividual an opportunity for the selection of such a 
breakfast as the season and the necessity demand. 

The grain course is suggested as a first course, 
a plan now being adopted to prevent the immoder- 
ate use of animal food, to which many are given, 
and which is condemned by Hygiene. 

Fruit is suggested as last, yet this is not arbi- 
trary. It does not matter what place it occupies, 
if only this wise sanitary custom of eating fruit in , 
the morning is obseiTed.

Beefsteak deserves the highest rank among 

breakfast fares. This Bible and chemically sanc- 
tioned food, purposely designed for man, is very 
satisfying to the stomach, and possesses great 
strengthening powers. To replenish the animal 
spirits there is no food like beef, and when kept 
till properly tender, and properly cooked, nothing 
will give the stomach less trouble. It is iron 
which gives the red color to flesh. Beef is not 
wanting in this life-giving element, which gives a 
decided verdict in its favor.

CRACKED WHEAT. 

Wheat as food is the most important of the 
grains, because it is more available for all the 
wants of the system than any of the other grains. 
It is said to be as nearly a perfect natural food as 
milk, containing everything in itself to support 
life, being composed of the same elements as the 
human body, and in about the same proportions. 

Sifting and Bolting lessen these properties 
to a serious extent. The bran, which is thrown 
away, contains about forty per cent of the nutri- 
ment of the grain. The miller robs it of its 
gluten and albumen, which make muscular 
strength; of its mineral and phosphatic prop- 
erties, which nourish bone, muscle, and brain. 

The only way now for us to secure this grain in 
perfection, and restore brain, bone, and muscle, 
is to cook it unground. It is delicious as well as 
wholesome when eaten with a dressing of cream 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 49 

or milk, fruit, sugar, or sirup, and is much used 
by those who understand the philosophy of grains. 

Cracked wheat is only in perfection when 
cooked in a double boiler, for it is an essential 
rule that grains of all kinds should never be 
stirred while cooking. This rule cannot be ob- 
served when cooked in a single boiler. When 
done, each grain should be charmingly light and 
porous, distinct, yet jelly-like. When watery, it 
is not palatable or attractive, and spoils the nice 
flavor and richness of the milk. The water should 
be boiling in the outside boiler, and boiling water 
put into the inside boiler. To nearly a quart of 
boiling water put a teaspoonful of salt, and a half- 
pint cupful of cracked wheat. Boil three hours 
or more, or till done. Grains are very unwhole- 
some and disagreeable when underdone. 

For breakfast it should be cooked the day pre- 
vious, and reheated in the morning, as there is 
not time then to give it the long cooking it needs. 
When reheated for breakfast, do not remove it 
from the inner boiler, but fill the outer boiler with 
boiling water, and let it boil till heated through. 
Do not add water to the inner boiler. Many pre- 
fer it cold. It takes the mould, and should be 
poured into it while hot, or before the starch is 
set, which makes a handsolne dish when served 
cold.

BEEFSTEAK. 

Never fry a beefsteak. People who know what 
really good cooking is, do not fry beefsteak. 
When fried in fat, it is both vulgar and indigesti- 
ble. Broiling, which suddenly hardens the sur- 
face, and keeps the juice within the steak, is the 
most eligible style for cooking beefsteak, and 
those who wish to invigorate themselves adopt it. 

The* appearance of beefsteak is injured by 
pounding it. If you suspect it is tough, the bet- 
ter method is to cut several parallel strokes across 
it on each side, with a sharp knife, not cutting 
through, but lightly cutting the surface. The 
quick heat will unite the incisions again, and when 
cooked you will hardly perceive them^ If there 
is much fat, trim it off, else it will drop on the 
coals and smoke. 

A light wire gridiron, that can be turned 
quickly, is best. Have a clear and hot fire, that 
will last through your broiling. For a minute, 
hold each side to the fire, to carbonize the surface 
before the broiling begins. This method saves 
the juice of the meat. When carbonized, expose 
it to a slower heat and broil it. Turn frequently, 
but do not stick a fork into it while broiling, or 
the juice will escape. Broil your steak lightly or 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 51 

rare, but not raw. Have your outside a good 
meat brown, your inside a nice red. Never salt 
steak while broiling, as it extracts the juice. 
When done, sprinkle it lightly with salt, lay it on 
a hot dish, with a few small pieces of butter, but 
do not have it swimming in butter, as the juice is 
supposed to be inside the steak. Pepper should 
be an individual application, if you do not know 
the desire of your guests. Set the platter in the 
oven a moment, to melt the butter. To be nice, 
it must be served hot. 

EGGS ON TOAST. 

Have in a spider boiling hot water, yet not litr 
erally boiling, and enough to cover an egg, when 
broken into it. Add a teaspoonful of salt. Place 
as many muffin rings in the water as is needed. 
Break each egg into a cup, then turn it gently 
into a ring. Let them cook without boiling. 
When delicately cooked, or till the eggs are cov- 
ered with a white film, remove the rings, and lay 
each egg on a slice of toast. This method gives 
a much handsomer dish than when dropped the 
usual way. Toast your bread in season for the 
eggs when done. Have ready a pan of hot water. 
Dip each slice quickly, only moistening, not soak- 
Jng it, and place in the platter for the eggs.

MACARONI

should be washed and broken into lengths of five 
or six inches. Put into a plenty of hot water 
previously salted. Boll half an hour, or until 
tender. Meanwhile, for the average quantity, 
scald half a cup of rich milk, and, while hot, add 
a table-spoon of butter, which pour over the mac- 
aroni, when ready to be served. In the winter, 
when potatoes are poor and unwholesome, this 
dish makes a very welcome substitute. 

COFFEE. 

The coffee, par excellence^ is an equal mixture 
of Java and Mocha, one giving strength, the other 
flavor and aroma. 

Coffee connoisseurs prefer roasting their own 
coffee, or having a personal supervision of it. 
First, let your coTffee get w^H dried and heated, 
then put it where it will roast. It should have 
undivided attention, and be stirred constantly till 
done. If left half a minute, the kernels next the 
kettle may burn black, and these will spoil all the 
rest. To have good coffee, it must be evenly- 
roasted a dark, rich brown. Black, burnt coflee 
has a bitter flavor, instead of being finely flavored, 
like nicely-roasted coffee. ' . 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 53 

After your coffee' is roasted, the next important 
feature is the grinding, which should be mod- 
erately fine. If ground too fine and powdery, it 
is hard to make it clear ; if too coarse, you lose 
much of the strength and aroma. It should be 
freshly ground each time it is used. Coffee 
should be kept in a dry place, in a tin can, or 
glass jar, tightly closed. 

The next thing is the cleanliness of your coffee- 
pot, of which many never suspect the importance, 
and do not empty their coffee-pot of dregs till 
obliged to. Coffee is just as imperfect as other 
food that has been cooked in an unwashed vessel. 
The coffee-pot should not be allowed to become 
coated with coffee dregs, but carefully washed 
every time it is used, in hot suds, rinsed, wiped 
dry, and set on the stove, where it will get per- 
fectly dry. 

It seems a waste of time to write out a recipe 
for making coffee, as most housekeepers have 
their favorite method. Messrs. Blot and Delmon- 
ico were very emphatic about the impropriety of 
boiling coffee, preferring it made in a French 
filter. Without any disrespect to either, the 
writer differs from their sanctioned opinions, and 
gives her experience of the coffee question. 

The ordinary coffee-pot was always used in my 



54 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

family. To clear the coffee, an eggj with the 
shell crushed, was stirred into a cup of moderately 
ground coffee before putting it into the coffee-pot, 
when a quart of tfoiling water was poured to both, 
the coffee-pot tightly closed, and J^oiled eight or 
ten minutes. A cupful was then poured out, to 
clear the spout from dregs, pouring the same back 
again. While clearing, which shouid take six or 
seven minutes, set on the back of the stove, 
where it can be kept hot. It is a mistake not 
to let coffee wait a few minutes after clearing the 
spout. With good cream, this was as delicious 
coffee as need be ; and I would say that you do 
not have coffee in perfection unless you have good 
cream. No matter how nice your coffee, how 
well roasted, or how boiled, if you do not have 
cream for an accompaniment, you do not have 
delicious and perfect coffee. Never decant coffee, 
for much flavor is lost by pouring it from one 
vessel to the other. 

Observe the following rules, and, without new 
inventions, they will give you good coffee. Buy 
good coffee. Roast it an even brown. Have a 
clean coffee-pot. Serve it in the vessel in which 
it was boiled. Boil quickly. Have cream, if you 
can ; else hot, but not boiled milk.

Buttered Toast. Balked Apple Sauce,

This simple and easily digested breakfast is a 
very valuable one for those who need much nour- 
ishment in a small compass. The accompaniments 
can be changed to suit one's taste and condition. 



SIRLOIN BEEFSTEAK. 

Take three slices of beefsteak, one a sirloin, 
and two from the round, as the round yields more 
juice than any other cut. Broil them rapidly and 
lightly. When cooked, place the choice sirloin in 
the middle of a platter, and add a little butter. 
With a meat-squeezer, press the juice entirely 
from the rounds over the sirloin. Serve at once. 
The essence of rare beef thus expressed is con- 
sidered a better tonic by some physicians than 
beef tea prepared the usual way. 



56 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 



BUTTERED TOAST. 

Very few know just how to toast bread nicely. 
Though simple and easy it often gets spoiled, and 
is seldom seen without symptoms of burning. 
The bread must not be too fresh. To make but- 
tered toast in perfection, you want a very light stale 
loaf of raised bread. You need a clear fire, and it 
is best when only one slice is toasted at a time, 
holding it at just the distance from the fire to 
brown nicely and without scorching. The whole 
surface of each side should be a golden brown. 
The perfect way is to butter each slice, when taken 
from the fire, and serve immediately, being in 
perfection only when freshly done. When not 
convenient to serve immediately, pile the toast as 
you finish it on a plate, cover it with a deep tin, 
and keep it in an open oven till served. 



BAKED APPLE SAUCE. 

Fill a baking dish with nice juicy apples, peeled, 
cored, and quartered. Strew sugar over them. 
Fit a plate closely over the dish, which set in a 
larger pan, with hot water in the bottom, about an 
inch in depth. Set it in the oven, and bake till 
clear aijd tender. If they are not very juicy, put 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 57 

two tablespoons of water to them. Prepare the 
day previous for breakfast, — very nice. 

COCOA. 

In this age of adulteration, wise and cautious 
people, who like to know what they drink, use 
cracked cocoa, or shells and cocoa mixed. To half 
or three-quarters of a cup of cracked cocoa, add 
one quart of boiling water, and cook two and a 
half or three hours. When sufficiently boiled, 
add sufficient hot water to make up for the evapo- 

m 

ration and to make it the right strength. Add 
sufficient milk, and let the whole come to a boiling 
point, but do not let it boil, as boiled milk gives 
an unpleasant flavor; or, you can heat the milk 
separately, adding a part to the cocoa pot and the 
rest to the cream pitcher, from which supply to 
your taste. The perfection of cocoa is its liberal 
supply of milk.

This tempting dish can be eaten with a dressing

wheat, if it can be obtained, as it coobe more 
readily and looks more inviting. Wash it well, 
turn off all that rises to the surface of the Avater, 
then drain it dry* If there is any foreign matter, 
it should be picked out. Put it into an inner 
boiler, with five or six times its measure of boilins: 
water. Add boiling water to the outer boiler and 
cook six or eight hours, or until all have opened 
' out similar to the kernels of popped corn. For 
breakfast it should be cooked the day previous, 
and reheated like cracked wheat.

RUMP BEEFSTEAK. 

The best cuts are from the middle of the rump, 
which has much flavor, and is preferred by many. 

"Broil lightly your beefsteak — to fiy it.

BAKED POTATOES. 

Americans are very fond of baked potatoes as 
an accompaniment to steak. When in perfection, 
mealy, and of the first quality in flavor, they are 
unrivalled. Unless they can be presented in this 
dainty condition, it is far better that they should 
be disguised and made palatable by some artifice 
which the French resort to; for unless these 
tubers are in mealy perfection, they are not easily 
digested. However well baked, their excellence 
depends on their being served immediately, as 
they quickly lose their lightness, and " the glory 
of a baked potato is its mealiness." 

RAISED BISCUIT, 

light as a foam, "The lighter the better,, altho' 
many do not think so.'* This is Prof. Blot's 
philosophy. "Lightness is a most important 
quality in warm biscuit, as it enables them to be 



CO WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

more easily acted upon by the digestive fluids," 
which will force a rapid passage through light 
biscuit, but can penetrate a rubber ball about as 
easHy as heavy baked ones. What is so rare as 
light, white, and thin-crusted home-made raised 
biscuit for breakfiist? Yet this luxury can be 
easily attained if the dough is well raised. 

In warm weather, raised dough can be kept for 
two or three days for morning biscuit, if covered 
with a damp cloth and set in a cold place, where 
it will not sour. In cold weather, if set in a cool 
place, where there is no danger of freezing, it will 
keep the same length of time. Certainly this is 
a convenience, and many think it improves the 
dough, if it can be kept sweet. 

If you are a novice, you must learn at the out- 
set that you cannot have good biscuit or bread 
without the best quality of flour, fresh and lively 
yeast. It is advisable to use compressed yeast, 
as it is best when it can be had fresh. Too 
much salt destroys the nice flavor of bread, too 
little makes it insipid. Liquid yeast is sometimes 
quite salt ; in this case you must be cautious about 
salting your bread. Compressed yeast requires 
salt in the bread. 

A little too much heat injures biscuit, and too 
little ruins them. If the oven is too hot, they 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 61 

will bake outside before the heat penetrates the 
centre, consequently you have them heavy and 
underdone in the middle. Unless the oven is hot 
enough the biscuit will spread. One that does not 
bake at the bottom will be likely to spoil your bis- 
cuit. A great deal depends on the oven. 

For morning biscuit, mix dough at nine o'clock 
in the evening. Scald your milk, and there will 
not be the danger of its souring. If not conve- 
nient to use milk, use all or a part water, and rub 
a teaspoonful of butter into the flour. 

RULE. 

One quart of sifted flour. 
One pint of warm milk. 
Half a cake of compressed. 
Or half a cup of liquid, yeast. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 

Make a hollow in the flour and add the salt. 
Dissolve yeast if compressed in a little of the wet- 
ting, and with the milk pour into the hollow. 
Mix till it becomes a dough. Dredge your mould- 
ing board evenly with flour. Lay youK dough 
upon it and knead twenty-five minutes. In knead- 
ing, use just flour enough to keep the dough from 
sticking to the hands. The great mistake in mak- 



t)2 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

' ' ■ r . 

ing dough is getting it too stiff with flour. When 
the fingers can be pressed into it without sticking, 
your bread is kneaded enough. Learn to get the 
right consistency, without too much flour, which 
should be soft as possible without sticking. 
Twenty-five minutes are long enough for the first 
kneading and ten for the second. When kneaded, 
return to the bowl, which should be earthen, as it 
is a better protection from cold than tin. Cover , 

warm, and place where no draft of cold air can 
strike across it, for if allowed to be changing 
temperature while fermenting, it will hinder its 
rising, and your dough will be heavy. To rise 
well, it needs an even temperature of seventy 
degrees. 

In the morning, as soon as you go into your 
kitchen, with a spoon push the dough down from 
the top and sides of the pan, and let it rise again. 
When light, knead it ten minutes, lightly, avoid- 
ing much .flour. When kneaded, cut little bits for 
your biscuit, mould with your hands into small 
rounds, without using any flour. Set them a little 
distance apart, in a lightly-buttered pan, cover 
with a cloth, and set where they can have an even 
temperature of eighty or eighty-five degrees. 
When risen to twice their size, they are ready for 
the oven. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes. When 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 63 

done, let them remain a few minutes, with the 
oven door open, to dry off the moisture and ripen, 
and prevent them from being sticky. 

You now have the secret of light biscuit. 
Nowadays many cooks rush their biscuit through 
in half or three-quarters of an hour for breakfast, 
which accounts for their being half-risen, half- 
baked, sticky and doughy in the mouth. May 
you see the folly of this, and rise in season to give 
your biscuit time to rise, bake, and dry off, else 
you will never have them light.

Stir this gradually into boiling water, which has

TOMATO SAUCE. 

Pour boiling water over well ripened tomatoes, 
to remove the skins. When skinned, cut into a

taste. Salt them, adding a little pepper and but- 
ter, if agreeable. 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. C5 

"We need not eat the tomato with fear and 
trembling, as many are wont to do. There is no 
evil about it, and when we don't take care of our- 
selves it will take care of us. It is a delightful 
substitute for calomel, and we may wonder how 
the ancestral liver could have been kept comforta- 
ble without this anti-bilious food. That it is in- 
valuable, and one of the most healthful esculents 
in the vegetable kingdom, is the popular opinion. 
Its healthful qualities do not depend on its mode 
of prepai'ation, and it may be eaten twice or thrice 
per day with like advantage, cooked or uncooked, 
with or without a dressing, and to the utmost that 
the appetite requires. . Its healthful qualities con- 
sist in its slight acidity, which makes it as impor- 
tant as fruit, and when the diet is largely meat 
and bread, it is inestimable." 

RIPE FRUIT. 

In the present age, you do not have an a la mode 
breakfast unless fruit is served. Fruit is a gra- 
cious sanitary provision by our Heavenly Father, 
to cleanse the blood of too much carbon ; there- 
fore it is a very wise fashion. For breakfast, it 
may be eaten when most agreeable, first or last. 
All kinds of fruit are admissible to the breakfast 
table that are thoroughly ripe. The undeveloped

juice of fruit is very unwholesome. For this rea-

This breakfast is well patronized by hearty chil-

OATMEAL MUSH. 

You are not up to the times if you do not advo- 
cate oatmeal at your breakfast-table. " Prof. 
Liebig has chemically demonstrated, that oatmeal 
is almost as nutritious as the very best English 
beef, and that it is richer than wheat bread in the 
elements that go to bone and muscle." 

If this be true, surely every family should vote 



BEEFSTEAK BREAKFASTS. 67 

that they will give it a place at their breakfast- 
table. With many it is so popular it is found at 
this morning meal the year round. 

At the best appointed tables it is served as a 
first course for breakfast, the same as cracked 
v^heat. 'Tis said to be best relished if eaten 
previous to the rest of the meal, beside being a 
convenient arrangement for the preparation of 
the rest of the breakfast. 

When nicely cooked, it is charmingly porous. 
Many spoil it by soaking it over night, and fre- 
quently stirring it while cooking. The only safe 
and perfect way of cooking it is in a double or 
farina boiler. If you give it a regular place at 
your breakfast table, you will save time and money 
by providing one expressly for cooking oatmeal. 
You will find it a great improvement on the old 
way of cooking, for you will get a superior dish, 
with no waste or burning, neither made pasty, as 
by the stirring process. You may be sure of 
nicely-cooked oatmeal, when steamed in a double 
boiler. 

The water should be boiling in the outside 
boiler, and boiling water put into the inside 
boiler. Use one measure of meal to three meas- 
ures of water. Add salt to the water. Sprinkle 
the meal into the water, stirring only a few mo-

ments; then close the vessel, and boil one hour 
and a half. Oatmeal, served in a half-raw state, 
is both unwholesome and disagreeable. 

FRIED CRACKED WHEAT. 

Cracked wheat for frying should be moulded in 
a brick-loaf baking-pan, which gives you hand- 
some slices. When cold, slice it about three- 
quarters of an inch thick. Fry it on a griddle, in 
beef drippings, the same as hasty pudding. Do 
not soak it in fat, only using enough to keep froij? 
sticking to the pan. 

DRIED APPLE SAUCE. 

Thoroughly wash dried apples. Put them to 
soak in cold water, more than will cover them, as 
they absorb a great deal. Soak the old-fashioned 
dried apples for several hours. Simmer them 
steadily in a preserving-kettle in the same water 
in which they were soaked, till cooked. Never 
stir them, but when they rise, press them down 
with a spoon. Keep them closely covered. When 
tender, add nice brown sugar, and simmer fifteen 
minutes longer. To be nice looking, they should 
retain their form somewhat, yet must be perfectly 
done. The delicate, sliced dried apple can be 
substituted, which requires only twenty minutes'

soaking, and not as long cooking. Either are 
t nice, when green apples fail. 

RAISED LOAF BREAD. 

There are no better rules for mixing, kneading, 
and raising bread, than those given in Breakfast 
No. 3 for raised biscuit. The measures there' 
given can be doubled or trebled, to suit circum- 
stances. 

LIGHT BREAD 

is of great importance. The saliva and gastric 
juice penetrate it easily, and digestion is facili- 
tated. When dense and solid, these juices fail to 
act thoroughly, which is necessary to change bread 
into good blood. Undigested bread corrupts and 
decg.ys, poisoning the blood as certainly as when 
eaten already spoiled. 

KNEADING 

raised bread is very important, making it evenly 
porous and easier of digestion. To be scientific, 
the thorouo:h kneadinof should be done before the 
dough is raised, — beforQ the gas is established; 
and it follows that as soon as mixed it should be 
thoroughly kneaded twenty-five or thirty minutes. 
If the thorough kneading is done after the bread 



J

is raised, much of the gas you have taken the 
trouble to produce is pressed out of it. 

For raising dough, summer heat, or about 
seventy degrees, is most favorable. When the 
temperature is lower than this, the fermentation is 
so slow that there is danger of acidity before the 
gas has sufficiently formed. 

In an emergency, or haste, a temperature of 
ninety degrees can be used by lessening, the re- 
quirable time, which is six or eight hours. In 
this case, the process must be watched, or it will 
sour. If you find it rising too fast, it can be 
aiTested by setting it on the ice, or in a cool place. 

When sufficiently raised, it should be kneaded 
ten minutes only, using as little flour as possible ; 
then make it into loaves, put them into slightly- 
buttered pans, and raise the second time till nearly 
double their first size. If there is any danger of 
acidity, it is safer to bake a little sooner, for if 
the yeast has been thoroughly mixed with every 
part of the dough by kneading, the bread will be 
passably light, if the fermentation is a little less 
than the rule (doubling the dough). 

BAKING. 

It is a very nice point for a novice to decide, 
when the oven is the right temperature. An ex

perienced baker knows this without any rules. 
An inexperienced one can test the heat by holding 
the hand in the oven long enough to count twenty. 
If the hand cannot bear the heat this length of 
time, the oven is too hot, and the bread will bake 
outside before the heat has reached the centre, 
and it cannot rise. If not hot enough, your bread 
will lack sweetness. 

When right, put your bread into the oven, and 
let it stand at this figure eight or ten minutes, that 
the heat may penetrate the very centre before the 
outside bakes. This will heat the loaf all through 
alike, and raise it evenly before crust-bound. 
Then increase the heat, and bake from forty min- 
utes to an hour, the time depending on the size of 
the loaf. Generally, we do not bake bread thor- 
oughly. It should have a decided brown crust on 
each side. 

Always take bread out of the pans as soon as 
done, and lean it against a pan, where the pure 
air can pass around it. Never lay it on the table, 
as it will absorb the odor of the table. If the 
crust gets too hard, wring out a bread cloth (which 
should be a fresh one) in cold water, and wrap 
the bread in it. Never put bread away till cold. 
When warm, it absorbs the air about it, which 
should be pure as from the outside world, if 
possible.

72 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

An old-fashioned hanging shelf in a dry, clean, 
and well-ventilated cellar, is the nicest place to 
keep bread. It should be kept wrapped in a 
fresh and thick bread-cloth. If you cannot have 
this, or a similar convenience, the next best way 
is to keep it in a stone jar, which should be 
washed in hot water once or twice per week. 

Never let failures discourage you. No part of 
cooking education is more useful, if turned to 
proper account, than the discipline of failure. 
The success of bread-making depends on effort 
and experience. These will soon make you skil- 
ful, and you will feel as confident of success as in 
making a cup of tea. You may feel sure there is 
no luck about it. To be successful, care is re- 
quired, as in anything else.

HOMINY AND MILK. 

There are many ancestral dishes which should 
be perpetuated. They should be warmly recom- 
mended to children if we wish to preserve the 
vigor of our race. Hominy is one of the old-time 
preparations which should not be forgotten. 

It should be washed in two or three waters 
as you wash rice. Fine hominy requires four 
measures of water to one of hominy. Put it 
into an inner boiler and allow it to swell for half 
an hour ; then boil slowly for three-quarters of an 
hour. Like all mushes, it should be salted very 
lightly. It is better to put the salt into the water 
before adding* the grain. When nearly done, if 
too thin, uncover, and boil till about the con- 
sistency of hasty pudding.

a batter quickly, beating a few minutes longer. 
Bake in stone muffin cups three-quarters of an

than other cake. These are very light and nice. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into dice. When in 
the stew-pan, add cream enough to keep them

parsley and butter. Serve immediately while

GRAPES. 

**This fruit is a medicine as well as a luxury, 
and should be highly prized. The free use of the 
grape has a most salutary effect upon the system, 
diluting the blood, removing obstructions from 
the liver and kidneys, and enabling the blood to 
circulate in the remotest vessels of the skin, also, 
a healthful effect on that compound affliction, dys- 
pepsia. From two to four pounds per day may 
be eaten with benefit. These remarks apply to 
the fruit when perfectly ripe ; when unripe, like 
all unripe fruit, it deranges the digestive organs."

A BEEFSTEAK 

From the round affords more juice than any other 
cut. If you know how to market (and I am sorry 
to say that housekeepers have to trust too much 
to their provision dealer), select a cut from the 
top of the round, and if not tough you will not 
ask for a nicer, more juicy steak. I have eaten it 
so tender and juicy, that I thought it was a nice 
rump steak. It makes an inexpensive breakfast, 
being much cheaper per pound than other beef- 
steaks. 

BOILED EGGS. 

This, beyond question, is the most popular way 
of serving eggs, for which I give an approved 
French method. Have ready a saucepan of boiling 
water. Place in it fresh eggs. Put on the lid 
of saucepan and set on the stove where it will

keep boiling hot, but not boil. Let the eggs 
remain six or eight minutes, or as suits your 
guests. Serve in a napkin, on a dish, folding it 
over to retain the heat, or use a covered egg dish. 

FRIED HOMINY. 

Cook your hominy as in Breakfast No. 6. 
Mould it in a small oblong tin pan. There is a 
size, which will give you slices just square when 
cut. Wet the pan 'with cold water to prevent its 
sticking. When cold cut in slices nearly an inch 
thick, flour each side, and fry a nice brown, on 
the griddle, in a little butter or sweet drippings. 
It should be cooked the day previous. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

If the system is more or less feverish, and such 
is the case usually "with most people, nothing can 
be more refreshing and cooling than ripe straw- 
berries. They are a great preservative against 
the heating influence of meats in hot weather. 
'Tis said that the strawbeny is the most whole- 
some of all fruits, being easy of digestion, and 
never growing acid by fermentation on the stom- 
ach, as most other fruits do.

OVEN-BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

Try this labor-saving experiment, and, like

apprised, you might not suspect that your steak 
was not gridiron-broiled. To begin, your oven 
must be very, very hot, else you will lose the 
juice of your steak. A moderate oven would ruin 
it, for, to be in perfection, it must be quickly 
seared with heat. Other principles are the sapie 
as for gridiron-broiling. 

Lay your steak into a dripping-pan large enough 
to hold it without condensing. Set it in a hot 
oven. If thick, it will need to remain ten min- 
utes, according to the doneness you prefer. When 
done, season to taste, and serve on a hot platter.

An earthen teapot is more wholesome for 
steeping tea than tin. The water of which it is 
made should always be freshly boiled, and boiling 
hot when added to the tea ; the tea-pot rinsed and 
scalded each time that tea is made. Many a nice 
cup of tea has been spoiled by not scalding the

Although corned beef hash is very ancient, it 
has stood the test of time, and when well prepared 
is much esteemed, and is by no means despised hi 
Delmonico's. 

There are many ways of spoiling it. First, by 
frying instead of heating it. Second, by dredging 
flour into it, which imparts a raw taste like dough. 
Third, by using too much water, which makes it 
insipid. Fourth, by using too much fat or gravy, 
which spoils its delicacy. Lastly, by burning it., 
which gives it a bitter flavor. 



96 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

— ' r 

DELMONICO'S CORNED BEEF HASH. 

Chop cold corned beef rather fine, but not too 
fine. Chop, not mash, about one-third as large a 
quantity of cold boiled potatoes. They are not as 
nice for beef hash when hot, and if either potatoes 
or meat are chopped too fine, your hash will be 
salvy. Have it neither dry nor watery, but moist. 
Cover it close and heat a few minutes. When 
hot, if no gravy has been used, stir into it a little 
butter. Serve on a hot dish. 

Many think the perfection of corned beef hash 
is to chop a boiled beet with it. This is very 
good when made in right proportions and not too 
much beet. You do not need quite as much 
potato when beet is added. In this case you omit 
the pickled beet, and provide a substitute.

FRIED LIVER. 

Fried liver is a favorite with many. It should 
not be strongly urged, yet it is better than no 
meat. Have your beef drippings boiling hot when 
the liver is put into it, or it will soak fat. It 
needs to be well cooked, though not to a crisp, 
which makes it juiceless. 

FRIED APPLES 

Are an acceptable companion for liver. Do not 
pare them, but preserve the form of the slices

with the paring. Add a spoonful of water, some 
of the liver gravy, cover closely and fry without 
stirring. When nearly done, add a little Porto

Venison takes a few minutes longer to broil than 
beefsteak. Have your fire clear and hot. Broil 
rapidly, turning often. Observe the same rules 
as for beefsteak, so as not to lose a drop of juice. 
Have ready a hot platter on which are a few bits 
of butter. When done, lay your steak on the 
butter, turning it over and salting it on each side, 
adding a little currant jelly.

the steaks, roll them tightly and tie. Lay them 
on a trivet or stand, fitted into a roasting pan. 
Have a hot oven, that the surface may soon sear 
and securely hold the juices. Bake half an hour

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS 

Arre especially nice when broiled in perfection. 
The gridiron must first be warmed, or the chop 
-will stick to the bars. A fine chop is full of juice, 
and none of it should be wasted. The heat of the 
fire should be so great that it will instantly harden 
the outside of the meat so that the juices cannot 



114 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

run out. Never stick a fork into a chop, as it lets 
out the juice. When done, salt, and butter. 
Serve hot. 

GRAHAM PUFFS. 
One cup and a half Graham flour. 
One cup of flour. 
Two teaspoonfuls of sugar. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 
Two liberal cups of sweet milk. 
Three eggs. 

Mix salt with the flour. Beat up a batter with 
the flour and milk. Beat the yolks of the eggs to 
a froth. Beat the whites till stiff. Beat the 
yolks, then the whites into the batter. Bake in 
buttered stone cups half an hour or more. Use 
your judgment and do not keep them in too long. 
When done they will be well popped over. Keep 
the oven closed as much as possible. 

Ignorant cooks often spoil this simple and 
delicate cake by persisting to use baking powders 
or soda. They cannot believe they will rise with- 
out them. 

SLICED TOMATOES. 
These are a favorite complement to chops. 
Select the fairest ripe ones. Scald and peel them. 
When cold, slice them. Dress with vinegar,

This is an admirable breakfast, when served dry

to^ give the chops an elegant appearance. Dip 
each chop in beaten egg, then roll it in powdered 
crackers. Meantime, have the superfluous fat 
tried out in a frying-pan, and, when boiling hot, 
lay the chops into it, and fry. Use as little fat as 
possible.

Half a cake of compressed. 

Or half a cup of liquid yeast.

Mix flour, meal, and salt. Scald the milk, and, 
when at blood heat, pour into the middle of the 
flour. Dissolve yeast, and with the molasses add 
to the mixture. Beat all thoroughly to a batter 
dough. When well mixed, set it in a temperature 
of about sixty-five degrees over night. Graham 
sponge sours -more quickly than white, and should 
not rise in so high a temperature. 

Early in the morning, beat it up well, and let it 
rise again. When about to bake, dissolve half a 
teaspoonful of soda in a very little warm water, 
and thoroughly incorporate it with the batter. 
Bake in well-buttered muffin-tins or gem-pans. 
These do not require so hot an oven as white muf- 
fins, but should bake longer. 

BROILED TOMATO. 

Cut each tomato into two slices, without peeling. 
Lay them into a wire gridiron, and broil carefully, 
turning like steak, to keep the juice. Have them 
a nice brown on both sides. When dished, add a 
bit of butter to each. Salt and pepper to taste.

If you try this labor-saving experiment, you 
may conclude that your mutton chops are only in 
perfection when oven-broiled. Trim the chops, 
but not so much as to make them entirely deficient 
in fat. Lay them in a meat-pan, and broil in a 
quick oven. A slow oven would spoil them. Do 
not broil them too long. Season and serve. 

GRAHAM BISCUIT. ' 

The preceding Graham muffin receipt. makes a 
nice biscuit mixture. Observe its full direc- 
tions. The usual failure in Graham biscuit is 
generally caused by kneading in too much flour. 
They should be made less stiff than white biscuit, 
and kneaded just as soft as possible. Prick the 
biscuit with a fork, to prevent the crust from 
binding.

is very convenient to fry buckwheats from, which 
should be covered with a thick cloth, over night. 

In the morning beat your batter well and set it 
near the fire 'for a second rising. Buckwheats are 
not in perfection without soda, which should be 
added whether the cakes are sour or not, but not 
till just before they are baked. When breakfast is ;

VEAL. 
The Bible establishes the eatinsr of veal. '' And 

or 



brine: hither the fatted calf and kill it/' 



And Abraham ran into the herd, and fetched a 
calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young 
man, and he hasted to dress it." 

Beware of eating too young veal. Nowadays 
it is sent to the market very young, for the reason 
that it is not so remunerative as the cow's milk. 
'Tis said many diseases, especially in children, 
come from eating too young veal. In earlier times 
it was thought that veal was not eatable before it 
was four or five weeks old. It is very easy to 
know when it is too young, as the bones are very 
tender and like nerves.

CAFE AU LAIT. 

Americans are very ambitious of French names, 
and caf(S au lait is being domesticated in their 
kitchens. Its French name sounds new to many, 
yet it is a very ancient method of preparing coffee. 
In bygone days my grandmother, and later my 
mother, when there was milk to spare, often made 
our coffee half milk, which the French call caf6 
^u lait.

SCALLOPED VEAL. 

Many think this the best way to serve fragments 
of veal. Chop cold roast or stewed veal very 
line. Butter a round, deep, baking-tin. Put a 
layer of veal in the bottom, next a layer of pow- 
dered crackers or dry bread. Alternate these 
until the pan is full, having a thick layer of crumbs 
on the top. Moisten each layer with, a little of 
the gravy, if any remains from the roast veal, 
otherwise strew tiny bits of butter on each layer 
of veal, and moisten with water. Cover with a 
tin plate. If small, bake nearly half an hour, if 
large, three-quarters. Do not get it so moist that

it will not retain its form, when inverted on a

CREAM TOAST. 

Toast bread to a golden brown. Scald your 
milk in a farina boiler. When scalding hot, thicken 
it with a very little com starch or flour dissolved 
smooth in a little cold water. Do not make starch 
of it. I have eaten it so thick with flour that it 
tasted like starch. Be sure your milk is scalding 
hot, when you add your thickening, which pour 
into the middle of the milk, stirring it gently till 
all is thickened. After simmering till there is no 
raw taste of the flour, add a little butter and stir it 
through the milk. Have your toast ready. Lay 
a few slices on a deep dish, pour over them some 
of the hot cream, then lay on a few more slices 
and pour over again. Lift the lower slices, one by 
one, that the creamy mixture may run betweei;i.

OVEN-BROILED VEAL CUTLETS. 
Veal steaks can be broiled in the oven with bet- 
ter effect than over the lire. The oven should be 
as hot as for baking meat, otherwise you will dry 
and spoil them. When oven-broiled, they get 
cooked more thoroughly, and few people are fond 
of rare veal. Lay the steaks in the bake-pan, using 
a very little of the fat, only enough to keep them 
from sticking and scorching. Fit a tin plate closely 
over them^ to keep them steaming while baking. 
When done, if there is any fat, drain it from them. 
Season with salt and butter, the same as for other 
broiled steaks. 

CORN-MEAL RAISED MUFFINS. 
One pint of sweet milk, or warm water. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 
One cupful of flour. 
One heaping tablespoonful of sugar. 
Half a ca]^e of compressed yeast.

in muflSn-tins. Yeast mufBns have the advantage 
of soda muffins, as they are not heavy when cold, 
but palatable. 

WATER-CRESS SALAD. 

Like the tomato, this vegetable possesses the 
double quality of food and medicine. " According 
to analysis by M. Chatin, Director of the School of 
Pharmacy, Paris, water-cress contains iron, iodine, 
phosphates, and other salts. As a medicine, it has 
been vaunted for its efficacy in all cases of weak 
digestion, and has been prescribed for scrofula and 
phthisis. For food, it ought to be used in its 
green or uncooked state, in the form of salad or 
without any seasoning.''

them on a griddle greased only enough to keep 
them from sticking. Bake both sides a nice brown. 
Do not turn them twice. Serve only a few at a 
time. 

These are much more nourishing and whdlesome 
than any buckwheat griddles. Those who indulge 
in buckwheat will be wise to substitute Graham.

FOWL. 

The Bible has given no general catalogue of the 
birds allowed for man's food, but has catalogued 
those disallowed, which are birds of prey and 
scavengers of offal and carrion. Our domestic 
' fowl are healthy, when properly cared for, and their 
meat sound and wholesome.

BROILED CHICKEN. 

Chicken for broiling should be split open at the 
back, washed, wiped dry, the breast bone flattened 
with a mallet, and the wings twisted back that the 
breast may show; beside, a chicken looks very 
badly with the bones and wings sticking out. 
Never broil a fowl that is tough. It would be 



,146 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

impossible to make it eatable by broiling ; and if 
sure that it is tender, you may nlake it more so 
by first, steaming it twenty minutes. From the 
steamer transfer it to the gridiron, inside down. 
Turn it several times. When broiled a nice 
brown, season with butter and salt. Before 
steamers were used, I have parboiled a fowl pre- 
vious to broiling ; but this process robs it of its 
juiciness. When steamed, it retains its juice, and 
cooks those parts tender which, if only broiled, 
would be so scorched that they could not be 
eaten. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. . 

One quart of flour. 

One teaspoonful of soda. 

Two teaspoonfuls of cream-tartar. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Half a cup of creamed butter. 

One pint of rich sweet milk. 

One quart of strawberries. 

Incorporate soda, cream-tartar, and salt well 
into the dry flour. Work the creamed butter into 
the prepared flour, till fine and yellow. Pour the 
milk to this mixture, and mould to a delicate 
dough, which divide into three^ parts. Roll each

part quickly half an inch thick. Fit each to a 
Washington-pie plate and bake at once. 

Meantime, mash the strawberries, adding sugar 
to your taste. Keep them in a cold place till the 
cakes are ready. When the cakes are done, re- 
verse the tin and lay the cake upon it. Take a 
thin sharp knife, dip it into hot water, then wipe 
it dry, find equally split the cakes. Do not split 
them with a cold knife, as it flattens the bread. 
Butter each half; lay one third of the jam on each 
under crust and cover with the upper crust. Serve 
quickly.

possible. The pan must be dry, so that the chicken 
will brown on the bottom. The secret of success 
is to have the oven just as hot as the chicken will 
bear without burning. It would not be like broil-

with salt and butter.

This was a favorite breakfast of my mother*s, 
and I well know its merits. For breakfast, 
the chicken should be boiled the day previous, 
unless you are a very early riser. The chicken , 
*need not be as tender as for broiling. Whea 
washed and dissected, put into a stew-pan and 
barely cover with warm water. Very cold water 
draws the juice out. Cover and stew slowly till 
tender, but not so much as to drop in pieces. 



DOMESTIO FOWL BREAKFASTS. 149 

If boiled the day previous, heat the liquor with 
the chicken in the morning. When hot, add 
butter and a very little smooth thickening. If the 
chickens are very fat, they will not need the ad- 
dition of butter. After adding the thickening, 
stew gently seven or eight minutes. The addition 
of parsley, cut fine, is considered an improvement 
by some. Serve with the gravy poured over it.

nicely peeled and cut " thin as a wafer " will make 
a large sized dish full. When sliced, put them 
into icy cold water for a few moments to crisp 
them, then between two cloths to dry them. Use 
a deep kettle, as the fat is in danger of spattering 
over when the potatoes are put into it. A Scotch 
kettle is best, and every housekeeper should have 
one for frying. Have the fat hot, or the potatoes 
will soak fat. There should be as much drippings

brown, remove them from the fat with a skimmer 
to a dry colander, which should be set in a plate

IX. 

CLARIFIED DRIPPINGS. 

Claiufy means to make pure or clear. The care 
of drippings is a very important item in a family, 
and every housekeeper should know what is done 
with them. An inexperienced cook will not be 
acquainted with the various ways of preventing 
them from being wasted, and if experienced may 
not be inclined to take the trouble unless she is 
looked after. Then there are families who look 
upon drippings as unfit to use, and consign them 
to the waste fat. When properly taken care of, 
they are more wholesome than lard for frying. 
Many persons quite unable to eat articles of food 
fried in lard find no inconvenience from those 
fried in drippings, and they are more convenient 
than lard for frying as they do not splutter and 
spatter over the frying-pan. . 

To clarify your drippings or gravy, pour them 
from the meat-pan into a bowl, instead of the crock 
in which you intend to keep them. Then pour 
into the bowl a little boiling water. Stir it, and 



166 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

set it away to cool. Next day, or when cold, ' 
remove the cake from the bowl, scrape from the 
bottom of it the impurities, put it into a saucepan 
with a little salt and boiling water. Let it set 
half an hour over a moderate fire and simmer. 
Do not hurry it, or it may acquire a burnt taste, 
which you cannot get rid of, and its pureness is 
spoiled. Skim during the process. When cold, 
remove from the water and dregs, scraping off* 
whatever adheres to it that looks foreign. Melt 
this cake again, as this melting sends out all the 
water. When free from water it will not taint, 
neither spatter, and will keep for months in a cold 
place. Strain it through a sieve, and do not cover 
or put it away till hard. Keep it in a stone crock, 
well covered. 

Earthen absorbs fat, and it becomes tainted, 
smells disagreeably, affecting the flavor of newly- 
added fats, and of whatever is cooked in it. How 
often you see warmed-over potatoes spoiled by 
keeping the fat in earthen which is soaked with it. 
No matter how clean your earthen vessel is, — you 
cannot scald out the old and tainted fat it has 
absorbed. Beware of tainted bowls, they are 
poisonous, and should be appropriated to the dirt 
barrel. Do not pour fat that has been used for 
frying to the crock that keeps the cakes, but have 



FISH BREAKFASTS. 167 

one for each. Always let fat that has been used 
pass through a fine strainer when you return it, 
else the sediment will spoil the next frying. 

CLARIFIED BEEF SUET. 

Where frying is very popular, drippings do 
not meet the demand, which makes it necessary 
to buy beef suet. This also needs renderinof to 
clear it from skin and veins. The parts around 
the kidneys are best. Cut in small pieces% 
and proceed as for trying lard. Cool in small 
cakes. 

THE PRINCIPLES OF FRYING FISH. 

Fried fish is very popular and often very con- 
venient, yet very badly performed by many, and 
has more failures than any othar cooking ope- 
ration. 

Although the fishmonger is supposed to have his 
fish clean, yet a clean cook will always rewash it. 
When washed, wrap them in a clean dry cloth, to 
make them perfectly dry. When the cloth has 
absorbed all the moisture, thickly dredge the fish 
with flour, fine oatmeal, or fine crumbs. If crumbs, 
they must be fine, or herein lies a failure. Coarse 
ciximbs are liable to drop ofl^, and take with them 



168 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

the fine ones. When salted and dredged, lay on 
a platter in readiness for frying. 

Have a clear and brisk fire. Be sure that your 
frying-pan is perfectly clean. In frying fish be 
particular not to use drippings that are not fresh. 
They will ruin the fish if they have been used for 
anything else. More fat is required for frying 
fish than for other meats. The drippings must 
literally boil, smoke, and appear on the point of 
burning when the fish is put into it, which at once 
hardens the surface of the fish, so that the fat can- 
not penetrate, and you may feel assured that your 
fish will not soak fat, neither will it stick to the 
pan or break. Many suppose if fat bubbles in the 
pan it is hot enough ; but this is not so, and those 
are nearest to the truth who do not drop their fish 
into the fat until it smokes. Fish will be crisp 
and of a golden brown when the fat is of the right 
temperature. 

Have your pan sufficiently large for the fish to 
lay flat on it. If cutlets, do not crowd them. Be 
careful riot to burn fish or fat. Lastly, bear in 
mind that if fish is thrown into the pan with un- 
melted or partly heated fat it will be spoiled, and 
so soaked with fat that it will be unsafe to eat 
it, for it will surely sicken the stomach. If you 
fail, there are four reasons for it. Either you did 



FISH BREAKFASTS. 169 

not have fat enough Or it was not hot enough, or 
your fish not wiped dry enough, or your crumbs 
not fine enough. Closely observe these sugges- 
tions, and failure will ^ot occur.

FRIED SMELTS. 

Smelts are classed by naturalists with the sal-

called *' the dainty of Boston." 

The nicest and only way is to fry them. Open 
them at the gills and press out the insides. Some 
cooks do not remove the inside, but they should, 
for the same reason done to other fish. Wash 
them clean, wipe them dry, roll them in meal or 
egg-crumbs. Have your fat boiling hot when the 



FISH BKEAKFASTS. 173 

fish are put into it. Do not sprinkle them with 
salt until they are nearly done, as they will not 
brown as well if salted at the first. Do not crowd 
them, or they will not be crisp and brown ; and 
unless served immediately they lose their crispness 
and flavor. Lay them on a cloth when evenly 
done, for the fat to drain, then serve quickly. 

BREAKFAST TWISTS. 

For breakfast twists prepare your dough the 
same as for biscuit in Breakfast No. 2. Cut from 
the dough three pieces as large as a coffee-cup. 
Roll each piece under your hand on a floured 
board to twelve inches in length, making it smaller 
in circumference at the ends than in the middle. 
When each piece is rolled, join one end to each of 
the other two, and braid them loosely together the 
length of the roll. Press the ends together firmly, 
brush them over with milk, and let them rise 
twenty minutes. Set them in a quick over, and 
bake thirty minutes. They can be made smaller 
if desired.

FRIED FLOUNDERS. 

Flounders are a delicious fish, and when fried 
in perfection are not to be disdained even by a

plenty of drippings, and if the fat is hot enough 
they will absorb nothing at all. They may be

very careful not to let it come to a boil. Boiling 
salt fish toughens it; but when cooked in hot

soaked the specified time, drain off all the water, 
adding more boiling water, more or less, to make 
it the moisture you like. Into a heaping spoonful 
of butter incorporate a little flour. Stir this to the

MINCED FISH AND POTATOES. 

What is left from dinner is usually used for

EAST-WIND GEMS. 

It is not known whether these hygienic breakfast 
cakes are of the days of unleavened bread, or a 
modem invention. You need not fear the east 
wind they may have imbibed, for the hot oven 
counteracts its mischievous influence, and they are 
not only hygienic, but taste good. Their fibre is 
like nut meats, and you will enjoy giving the teeth 
just the exercise they need when you are eating 
them. 

You are supposed to have baking-irons for these 
gems, else you had better not attempt them. 
Take very cold milk and water, half and half. 
Stir in Graham and white flour, half and half, 
little by little, until you have a batter that will 
drop from the spoon and not run. It must be 
stirred rapidly, lightly, and thoroughly, the more 
the better, to incorporate a large amount of air 
and insure lightness. It needs a strong arm to 
carry this into effect. 

Have the gem-pans ready hot in a Jiot oven. 
This you must be sure about to secure light gems. 
Drop the batter into the hot irons while in the 
oven, or if you are very quick take the irons out 
for convenience. They require a quick oven to 
bake them, else you lose the air they have taken 



EGG BREAKFASTS. 199 

in, which is a nice point to determine, for the oven 
should bake as fast as it can without burning. 

If you don't succeed this time try again, — keep 
trying and don't give it up. Make your batter a 
little thinner or thicker, your oven a little slower 
or quicker. There is a way, you may feel sure, 
and if you keep trying you will find it out, and 
will be likely to repeat your success often. When 
these culinary curiosities are in perfection they are 
light and pufiy, and you have pure unleavened 
bread, with no taste of "emptyings" or soda.

FRIZZLED BEEF. 

Half a pound of smoked beef, shaved very thin,

OMELETS. 

A heavy and scorched omelet is not fit to be 
served. To know just how to create this popular 
breakfast dish, and get it to the table so that it will 
be succulent, juicy, and soft as cream inside, with 
fine and firm outside, requires a little practice to 
m^ake one perfect. 

They should be cooked in a pan made on pur- 
pose, for a large frying-pan allows the omelet to 
spread too much, and a certain thickness secures 
the softness of the inside. Fry them only on one 
side. When the under side is done or browned, 
and the upper side brought to a moderate consist- 
ency, the brown side is to be folded once, or in 
three, as you fancy. 

There are a multitude of receipts for omelets, but 
the principles are the same for all, the difference 
being only in the flavoring. Allow from three to 
five eggs for an omelet ; but never over five for a 
single one, as they do not work well. If more 



204 WHAT TO GET TOR BREAKFAST. 

eggs are required, two or three omelets should be 
made. For breakfast, they are more delicate with- 
out flavoring.

egg^ and beat together. Do not salt them, as it

the pan set on the fire. Put into it about an ounce 
of butter, which is a rounded tablespoonful. Be 
careful not to let the butter brown. As soon as it 
is hot, pour in the omelet. When it sets or begins 
to cook, raise it often with the blade of a knife, to 
let the air and butter pass in, which keep it from 
burning. If the heat is right, the whole mass will 
puff up and cook in a minute. 

It is not necessary to wait till the whole is solid- 
ified, as its heat will finish cooking it after it has 
left the pan. When it ceases to be a liquid, turn 
one half upon the other, on a hot plate. Serve 
instantaneously. Hot plates are an absolute ne- 
cessity. If your omelet is perfect, you will find a 
porous material when you put a silver knife 
into it. 

Obs. — An omelet fried in chicken or turkey fat 
is much whiter and nicer than when fried in butter. 
Turkey and chicken drippings should be clarified 
the same as beef drippings.

for this is uncertain like all others, and does not 
wait. Beat together yolks and whites of five fresh 
eggs, until you can dip them up with a spoon. 
Stir to this one and a half cups of new milk. 
When mixed, pour iirto a well buttered spider 
already on the fire. Now you do not manage this 
like the ordinary omelet ; but with a spoon instead 
of a knife you toss it from the bottom as the egg 
"sets." Do not toss or dissever it too much, but 
when done, have it look like broken custard. 
When there is no liquid to the eggj turn it quickly 
into a warm dish, and serve directly. Salt, but- 
ter, and pepper, individually applied. Warm

keepers who do not appreciate the odds and ends 
of food. There are not a few spendthrift house- 
keepers, who never trouble themselves about a 
stale loaf of bread, clean and sweet pieces of meat, 
except to consign them to " the waste," but who 
must have whole and new materials to start each 
meal. Others are content with an unsightly dish, 
rather than exercise their taste and ingenuity in 
leaking a handsome breakfast dish from homely 
pieces of food. A sensitive and delicate stomach 
is often affected through the day when disappointed 
of breakfast by an unsightly dish, — out of all 
order and shape, — served on the same dish on 
which served before, — a dish of ragged butter 
and broken bread, that had been handled at a pre- 
vious meal ; and for the final dish muddy and 
unsettled coffee. Such a breakfast is anything but 
appetizing, and to some persons absolutely sick- 
ening. 



214 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Yet there are those who can produce a handsome 
breakfast from the fragments left from dinner the 
previous day. This economy is practised quite as 
often in homes where economy is Hot a matter of 
necessity, as where it is necessary, and such break- 
fasts are just as appetizing as new food when 
gotten in a tasteful manner ; but when served in< 
differently are a sheer waste. 

There are various ways of reconstructing food 
to gladden the stomach, among which croquettes 
should hold a place, for they are practical and 
satisfactory. These little culinary productions can 
be made of fragments of cold chicken, turkey, 
lamb, veal, game, fish, potato, and rice. Cold 
veal and chicken are especially nice for croquettes* 
An economical and tasty housekeeper can repro- 
duce, from uninviting fragments, a handsom# 
breakfast dish of croquettes.

VEAL CROQUETTES. 

Divest of skin and gristle the remnants of cold 
roast or stewed veal. Chop them fine, adding a 
quarter as much bread crumbs as meat. Allow 
one beaten egg to two cupfuls of the mixture, to 
bind it together. If needed, add a very little 
milk, cream, or gravy to moisten it. When mixed, 
season to taste, mould into pear shape, roll in egg 
and cracker crumbs, and place in a buttered bake- 
pan. Bake each side a nice brown in the oven ; 
or put them into a frying basket and fry in hot 
drippings. 

POTATO CROQUETTES.

of an inch thick, or thick enough to give them the 
desired strength. Grease the bottom of a baking- 
pan with sweet drippings, and place them in the 
pan so they will not touch each other. Bake them 
a nice brown. Brushing them over with a beaten 
egg when they begin to brown, except on the bot- 
tom, improves their appearance ; or you can make 
into balls or rolls, and fry in boiling fat. These 
should be egged and crumbed.

SAUSAGE. 

When made of harmless ingredients, those who 
have unimpaired digestion may occasionally in- 
dulge in sausage ; but as a frequent dish it is not 
to be recommended. To those who value their 
health, yet sometimes tolerate high relish, I would 
suggest sausage made at home under your own 
supervision ; for there are as many good reasons 
for home-made sausage as for home-made bread. 
If you buy your sausage, you know not what you 
eat. Perhaps tainted pork, so highly seasoned 
that you cannot tell of what kind of abomination 
they are made. Your organ of taste must be un- 
usually chemical if it can discover ''the hidden 
secret *' in this highly seasoned and disguised com- 
bination. 

Sausages made of veal, beef, or lamb, are much 
more wholesome than made of pork. Sausage- 
meat can easily be prepared by housekeepers, and 
it is just as satisfactory as when put into skins.

SAUSAGE CAKES. 

* 

Chop two pounds of lean beef or veal and a 
quarter of a pound of suet very fine. The com- 
mon fault is, the meat is not fine enough. If you 
have not a machine for chopping sausage-meat, 
you will find it more easily chopped, with an ordi- 
nary chopping-knife, when the meat is a little 
frozen. When chopped, season with pepper, salt, 
and sage, to your taste. You can make it in 
small quantities and oftetf , or in larger, and pack 
in a stone jar. When wanted for use, form into 
little flat round cakes, and bake in the oven on a 
tin, or h^at in the spider the same as mince. The 
last method is usually satisfactory-, and is quite as 
nice as when enclosed in a skin like commercial 
sausage; besides, you have the satisfaction of 
knowing what you eat.

very tight and tie them at each end and in the

With an Indian cake it furnishes a very acceptable

STEWED BEANS. 

The round or pea bean is the best and most deli- 
cate. Pick and wash a pint, or the quantity needed, 
of dried beans. Put them into a kettle with cold 
water. When they have stewed an hour, drain off 
this water and add fresh boiling water. Set them 
where they will simmer, adding more hot water 
when needed. Cook them indefinitely, till thor- 
oughly done ; otherwise they are indigestible and 
unwholesome like other underdone vegetables. 
When nearly done, add a few pieces of uncooked 
steak, roast beef or lamb, cut in squares about an 
inch in size, or a little beef gravy if you chance to 
have it, or a piece of butter. Add sugar and salt 
to your taste. Stewed beans should have plenty 
of juice and not dry like baked beans. In cold 
weather enough can be cooked to last two or three 
days, and the required complement for each meal 
reheated. 

JOHNNY CAKE. 

This cake was originally baked in front of an 
op%n £re on the hearth of an old-fashioned fire- 
place. Fireplaces are now superceded by ranges 
and stoves, consequently, our Johnny cake has to 
be baked on the griddle or in the oven, and is not

quite like its predecessors in flavor, yet it is a de- 
scendant. To make this cake, take 

Two cupfuls of Indian meal. 
A heaping teaspoonful of sugar. 
A saltspoonful of salt. 

Pour to these enough scalding water or scalded 
sweet milk to make a mixture thick enouo^h to re- 
tain its form when moulded in the hand. Let this 
stand half an hour or more. Grease griddle with 
butter. Fit a cake half an inch thick to it. Smooth 
its surface. When nicely browned turn, but just 
before turning, place a bit of butter on the cake to 
keep it from scorching after turned. The heat 
must be moderate. When both sides are nicely 
browned, it can be transferred to a pan and a hot 
oven to finish its crispness, or it can be baked 
entirely in the oven. These are a delicious corn 
cake, when baked long enough to give them the de- 
sired crispy sweetness, and are irresistible to the 
lovers of crust, and crisp Indian cake. Serve hot.

The natural flavor of peas is delicious, and to many

done, add a few pieces of roast beef or tnutton

Dissolve the soda in a little warm water and stir 
into the milk. Thoroughly beat the eggs which 
add to the milk. Stir into the mixture rye meal 
enouo^h to make a thick batter. In order that these 
famous pancakes be successfully made they must 
be thick enough to drop from the spoon, otherwise 
they will soak 'fat. They will be nearly round and 
not rough with irregular points if rightly thickened. 
Too many must not be put into the kettle at a time, 
as they rise a great deal and besides are in danger 
of cooling the temperature of the fat too much. 

Have ready a Scotch kettle of hot drippings. 
Dip your spoon into it each time you dip it into the 
batter, that it may slip quickly from the spoon. 
When the pancakes look done, try one with a knit- 
ting needle. If it comes 'out smoothly, they are 
done and should be taken out with a skimmer. 
They should be a nice brown outside, light and 
well done inside. Graham flour may be substituted 
for rye if preferred. 

RYE PANCAKES 

Are a breakfast of "ye olden times," and when in

breakfast still holds its place in many families. Its 
accompaniments are few, as it is a breakfast itself. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

For a pie boil the chickens in water enough to 
barely cover them. Skim them. When tender or 
done take them out into a platter and carve them 
the same as if to be served on the table. Remove 
the skin if very thick. Have ready a deep baking 
dish, lined with a thick paste. Have the dish pro- 
portioned to the quantity of chicken you wish to 
use. Arrange the chicken so tiiat the same kind of 
pieces may not come out together, when seiTed. 



ANCESTRAL BREAKFASTS. 249 

Sprinkle each layer with a little flour and salt. 
Fill the dish nearly full with the liquor in which the 
chickens were boiled, but not so full as to be in 
danger of boiling over. Cover with an upper paste 
and close the edges very carefully. Bake nearly an 
hour, or till the crust is handsomely done. The 
crust for chicken pie should be twice as thick as 
for fruit pies. Use butter in the liquor if you 
prefer it. 

PASTE FOR CHICKEN PIE. 

One quart of flour. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Two teaspoonfuls of cream-tartar. 

One teaspoonful of soda. 

One pint of sweet milk. * 

One cupful of butter. 

Mix these ingredients the same as for short cake, 
avoiding too much flour. This makes a nice and 
tender paste.

Divide this into so many parts as will be needed to 
fit your sheet pans when rolled half an inch thick. 
When evenly fitted to the pans, incise each cake 
with squares. Bake a nice brown. Break the 
cake in the incisions and serve hot.

HONEY. 

" My son, eat thou honey, because it is good ; 
and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste." 
— Bible. 

" Hast thou found honey ? eat so much as is suf- 
ficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith and 
vomit it." — Bible Hygiene. 

" It is not good to eat too much honey." — Bible 
Hygiene. 

Honey is a vegetable product. Pure and fresh 
honey, when eaten in moderate quantities, is whole- 
some. The comb is not easily digested. Old 
honey should be eschewed. — Modem Hygiene.

Chicken Pie. 



Baked Potatoes. Warm Biscuit, 



Apple Sauce. Coffee. 

CHICKENf PIE. 

Cook the chicken as for the ancestral chicken 
pie. When done, remove all the meat from the 
bones and flake it. Do not have it like mince, but 
in long, thin and manifest pieces. Line a large, 
deep soup plate with a thick paste, made per 
ancestral chicken pie rule. Fill the plate with 
chicken, sprinkle a little flour through it, adding 
butter, salt and some of the liquor in which it was 
boiled. Cover with a thick paste and bake a nice 
brown. Be sure you brown the under crust. 
Serve with a gravy made from the liquor in which 
the chickens were boiled.

SUNDAY BREAKFASTS. 

In this nineteenth century Sabbath, the clergy, 
teachers, also hearers, make heavy drafts on their 
brains, and keep the Sabbath at a high pressure. 
Unless their Sunday diet is nourishing and adapted 
to their individual wants, they fail to sustain the 
great Sabbath work which is before them. Religion 
and Hygiene demand quietness and freedom from 
care on this day, therefore we should make all the 
necessary preparations on Saturday for Sunday's 
diet that can be made, keeping no one from church 
or depriving them from reasonable rest, — yet that 
the pressing necessities of a modem Sabbath justify 
an easy, reasonable, nourishmg, and warm break- 
fast, who can disallow ? 



256 WHAT TO GET FOB BREAKFAST. 

SUNDAY BBKAKFAST No. 1. 

Cracked Wheat. 



Beefsteak. Baked Potatoes. 



Biscuit (light at a foam). Coffee. 



Ripe Fruit. 

This nourishing and easily digested breakfast 
is often absolutely indispensable for clergymen, 
vocalists, and teachers. Many think it a task 
to broil a steak on Sunday morning, yet it does 
not appropriate any more time than many warmed 
over breakfasts. The cracked wheat and biscuit 
can be cooked on Saturday. K the biscuit are 
very light, ethereal, they are as nice, some say 
nicer, when re-heated, than new ones. 



SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 2. 

Cracked Wheat. 



Minced Pish and Potatoes. Brown Bread Toast. 



Sweet Pickles. Coffee. 



Ripe Fruit. 

• MINCED FISH AND POTATOES. 

Minced fish and potatoes, accompanied with nice 
brown bread toast, is an easy and palatable break- 



SUNDAY BREAKFASTS. 257 

fast. Many housekeepers institute it for Sunday s 
breakfast, as it can be prepared on Saturday, and 
heated on Sunday morning. For directions, see 
Breakfast No, 78. 

BROWN BREAD TOAST. 

Instead of rye mix Graham meal with Indian for 
brown bread. It is thought quite like Boston 
brown bread, and makes superior toast. For 
brown bread toast, see Breakfast No. 80. 



SUNDAY EfREAKPAST No. 3. 

Oatmeal Mush. 



Pish Balls. Brown Bread. 



Coffee. Ripe Fruit, 

FISH BALLS. 
These are a convenience for Sunday breakfasts 
and usually meet with appreciation. They can 
be prepared on Saturday and heated on Sunday 
morning, arfd with oatmeal for a prelude, make a 
very substantial breakfast for those who require 
one. 

BROWN BREAD. 
For Sunday's breakfast, use your own favorite 
brown bread, or brown bread toast.

Cracked Wheat. 
Boiled Eggs. Buttered Toast. 



Coffee. Ripe Fruit. 

This is a convenient and nourishing breakfast, 
and can be accomplished in very little time. 



SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 5. 



Cracked Wheat, with Cream and Suarar. 



Cocoa or Caf^ au Lalt. 



This is a valuable and delicious breo-kfast, 
relished by many every morning. For delicate 
persons, cream is of especial value and is often 
digested more readily than milk. A dressing of 
cream and sugar add both to the'flavor and nutritive 
qualities of cracked wheat. 






SUNDAY BBEAKTASTS. 259 



BAKED PORK AND BEANS. 

' Tis said that a distinguished American clergy- 
man declined preaching to roast beef and plum 
pudding on Sunday afternoons, — which strongly 
suggests a dull and stupid audience, — and under 
the influence of such an indigestible mixture, un- 
appreciated sermons. Might not the clergy as 
reasonably decline preaching to baked pork and 
beans on Sunday forenoons, for it is allowed that pork 
is the most indigestible of all meats, besides being 
unscriptural ? . Just enough of easily digested food 
leaves all the faculties clear and energetic, there- 
fore may we not conclude that our conceptions are 
more or less influenced on the Sabbath by this 
indigestible breakfast? Do not lessons from ex- 
perience prove that an easy, nourishing, and readily 
digested breakfast is the right one for Sunday ? 



260 WHAT TO GET FOK BREAKFAST. 



SUNDAY BREAKFAST No. 6. 

Cracked Wheat. 



Baked Beef and Beans. Brown Bread. 



Coffee. Ripe Fruit. 

CRACKED WHEAT. 
The reason for introducing cracked wheat as a 
prelude to the *' irresistible " baked beans, is to 
prevent their excessive use on Sunday morning. 
A hearty breakfast of baked beans produces drow- 
siness with many. Physiologically, beans are not 
brain-inspiring, but excellent for those workers 
who make great use of their muscles, while no 
article is equal to wheat cereals for the nourishment 
of the brain. Why not institute a dish of cracked 
wheat for Sunday's breakfast, preparatory to beans ? 
With a dressing of sugar, cream, or milk, it is 
charming. It can be steamed on Saturday, and 
reheated on Sunday morning. 

BAKED BEEF AND BEANS. 
I am well aware that the devotees of baked pork 
and beans may feel a personal injury at the inno- 
vation made on their time-honored Sunday break- 
fast. I confess there is not a more convenient 
dish for Sunday's breakfast than baked pork and 



SUNDAY BREAKFASTS. 261 

beans; for th^y can be cooked on Saturday and 
reheated on Sunday morning. Notwithstanding 
this, the unwholesomeness of pork should be a 
sufficient excuse for substituting another com- 
panion. Baked beef and beans are just as con- 
venient for Sunday's breakfast, and many think 
quite as savory. 

Instead of pork, select the same quantity of 
fresh beef, not deficient in fat, — more or less, as 
you prefer. You will have to learn from experi- 
ence the quantity of beef that will render it most 
palatable. Prepare the same as pork and beans, not 
omitting the preservative element, salt. Try this. 

When corned beef is sweet and nice, some think 
it preferable to fresh beef; but you incur a risk by 
using it, as sometimes it is kept too long before 
corned, and impaits an objectionable flavor to 
beans. 

BROWN BREAD. 

This accompaniment to baked beans is made 
absolutely necessary by the law of the palate. 

Two cupfuls of Indian meal. 
Two cupfuls of Graham meal. 
One teaspoonful of soda. 
One teaspoonful of salt. 
Half a cupful of molasses. 
Half a cake of compressed yeast. 



262 WHAT TO GET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Do not scald Indian meal if sweet and fresh. It 
will be lighter if not scalded. Thoroughly mingle 
the salt, soda, and dry meal. Pour the molasses 
into the middle of the meal. Mix with warm water 
to a smooth batter about as thick as Johnny cake. 
In the summer this should not b6 made over night, 
as it rises quicker than other bread. For Sunday 
morning, it can be raised Saturday forenoon and 
steamed in the afternoon. When sufficiently light, 
put the mixture into a well-greased bread boiler. 
Do not quite fill it, but leave room for the meal to 
swell. Cover bot^h boiler and steamer and boil 
steadily for four and a half hours. At the end 
of this time, take the boiler out of steamer, remove 
the lid, and set in a hot oven for half an hour, to 
dry oflF, and form a tender crust. To be nice it 
must be hot, and should be reheated on Sunday 
morning.
