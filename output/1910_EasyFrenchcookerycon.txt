PREFACE 

This little book has been compiled for 
the express purpose of enabling English- 
women to practise French cookery capably 
and economically. For many years,. M.' 
Mario, a chef of wide experience, well known 
both in England and on the Continent, 
collected recipes of the most attractive and 
economical French dishes, and they are 
now published, for the first time, in this 
volume. 

It has long been the opinion of English 
housewives that French cookery is expensive, 
and for that reason, and because of the 
difficulty in obtaining simple recipes, few 
English kitchens have witnessed the making 
of those appetising dishes which, except in 
France, are to be enjoyed only at the best 
hotels and restaurants. M. Mario's recipes 



PREFACE 



and hints prove conclusively that good 
French cookery need be neither difficult nor 
costly. 

The book also contains a number of care- 
fully selected menus, in English and in 
French; and in the recipes will be found, 
except in cases where such information would 
be superfluous, instructions as to how the 
dishes in these bills of fare can be produced 
successfully by any intelligent woman with 
a preHminary knowledge of cuUnary prin- 
ciples and a love for the assuredly delightful 
and truly feminine art of fine cookery.

EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

HINTS FOR SHOPPING 

Do not simply give your orders and 
allow your butcher or fishmonger to cut 
you your meat or fish at his own discre- 
tion, but remain and see it cut or prepared 
yourself. 

Tender meat is usually judged by the 
brownness of the outer skin of the exposed 
fat, the smoothness of the grain, and the 
soft white fillets or fibres on the surface of 
the meat. 

Meat, to be in really good cooking con- 
dition, should not be freshly killed, but 
should have been properly hung for at least 
seven days. 

It is essential that the larder in which 
meat and game are kept should have a 
draught or current of cool air passing 
through, besides being kept cold by the 
aid of ice during the hot months, as the 



EASY FRENCH COOKERY 



cold air not only tends to keep meat fresh, 
but helps to make it more tender and 
more nourishing. 

Foreign meats may be recognised by 
the coarse grain and the slightly swollen state 
of the veins ; they are generally used for 
making stews, ragouts, or any dishes in 
which the quality of the meat is coverecj 
by means of sauces. 

The best veal comes from France, where 
the calves are most daintily fed, eggs and, 
similar luxuries forming a part of their 
recognised diet. EngUsh calves are usuallj| 
turned into the fields with their mothers, 
and obtain little other nourishment than 
Nature provides for them, the result being 
that their French neighbours obtain more' 
favour when finally criticised on the table.^ 
Veal should be smooth in grain, and quite 
white. 

When buying fish, Uft ttie gills near the 
head, and if they are of a bright red it may 
be taken as a sign of freshness. If, on ihei 
other hand, the giUs are dull or dark in' 
appearance, it is in most cases a sure indica- 



HINTS FOR SHOPPING 



tion that the fish has been kept too long 
and is not worth purchasing. 

Soles, brill, turbot, cod, haddock, and 
trout should be cooked very fresh, and 
whitebait should be cooked the same day 
as caught. Red mullets will keep on the 
ice for three or four days without losing 
their good qualities ; so also will salmon 
or mackerel. 

Game of all descriptions can be kept 
for varying periods, some varieties remain- 
ing good for as long as fifteen days in a 
proper larder, but the diner who is not 
partial to high game would do better not 
to preserve it longer than three or four 
days. Game should have, when bought, a 
plump and firm appearance. 

Great care should be taken that foreign 
partridges, pheasants, etc., are not palmed off 
as English. Native birds may be known by 
the black rings round the legs. These rings 
are absent on the foreign game, which has 
an altogether coarser appearance. 

Chickens, ducks, and turkeys should have 
a white appearance, and not be coarse. 



EASY FRENCH COOKERY 



They can, if necessary, be kept five or six 
days in the larder before being prepared for 
the table. The very best poultry is that 
which has been reared on a farm. 



HINTS FOR THE KITCHEN 

Always wash vegetables in salted water; 
by this means all insects are killed. 

Keep a special knife for onions. 

Do not have a roaring fire; it is un- 
necessary. 

Always make a dish look nice and 
appetising; half the battle is then won. 

Never omit to taste a sauce. 

Press fruits in wooden presses, as presses 
of metal easily corrode and cause the colours 
of the fruits to fade. 

Thoroughly scald all new saucepans and 
stewpans before using. 

Each culinary utensil should have its 
place, and should be kept in it when not 
in actual use. The untidy cook wastes half 
her time looking after things which she has 
lost or mislaid. 

The correct temperature for a cellar is 
(sixty degrees Fahrenheit. 

Clarets and Burgundies should be 



EASY FRENCH COOKERY 



slightly warmed, Moselles or hocks should 
be iced. 

Try any new dishes yourself before ex- 
perimenting on other persons. 

Do not lose your temper when anything 
burns through your carelessness ; and never 
use bad language to the saucepans. 

Remember that cooking is a fine art, 
and that the knowledge of it, when perfectly 
acquired, is very valuable. Many of the 
leading chefs enjoy a salary of {,i.,ooo a 
year. 



TABLE DECORATION AND SERVICE 

The table-cloth should be spotlessly white, 
and should be laid without being creased. 

A lamp or candelabrum, with soft red 
shades, preferably of silk, gives the table 
a comfortable appearance. Entwine round 
it a little smilax, and provide three or four 
small vases of flowers, either carnations and 
roses, or lilies-of-the- valley and roses, relieved 
with maidenhair fern or asparagus fern, or 
any flowers of the season. 

Do not endeavour to have a flower for 
every colour of the rainbow. Nothing is 
more select and refined than just two or 
three colours, tastefully blended, and deli- 
cately arranged with green. 

In table decoration a pretty effect is 
ensured by quality and taste, not by quantity. 
Take care that the flowers are not so high 
as to prevent the guests from seeing each 
other. 

Now lay a small dessert plate for each 



EASY FRENCH COOKERY 



person dining, on which place a napkin 
quite plainly folded or with the comer 
rolled under. It becomes disagreeable to 
the habitual diner to find his napkin fan- 
tastically arranged, perhaps with finger marks 
and creases all over it. Place a little 
dinner roll on each napkin, a small knife 
and fork, and one soup spoon at the sides 
of the plate. One wine and one water 
glass should complete the convert. 

Avoid placing too much silver and a 
lot of unnecessary paraphernalia on the 
table, as it interferes with the comfort of 
the guests, besides being at this period quite 
out of the " mode." 

Hors d'oeuvre should be arranged on 
a tray which has a napkin on it, and should 
be handed round. If the dining party 
does not .exceed three or four persons, and 
if there is room to arrange the hors d'oeuvre 
on the table, this should be done before 
the guests take their seats. 

The waiter or maid should always take 
great care not to make a noise or get flur- 
ried, but should move about quietly. When 



TABLE DECORATION AND SERVICE 9 

la5ang service for a dish, place the articles 
on a napkin-covered plate. This wiU deaden 
the sound of clinking silver. 

In order that the fingers may not soil 
the sides of the soup-plates, a second plate 
should be placed underneath before ladling. 

Always serve wine from the right side 
of a guest, and pass the dishes from the 
left. Never pass the arm or hand in front 
of a diner to reach for something past 
him. It is much better to apologise and 
to disturb him in order that you may 
reach the required object quite comfort- 
ably. 

When the dinner has reached the sweets 
course, make a partial clearance of the 
table before serving. Take away aU plates, 
empty glasses, and crusts, and remove all 
crumbs. When coffee is about to be served, 
lay a napkin over the cloth, should it be 
in the least soiled. 

Serve finger-bowls of tepid water on a 
plate, and let there be a sHce of lemon and 
a dash of rose-water in each bowl. 

By this time the servants should have 



10 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

cleared the sideboards of all dishes, plates, 
and silver, and with the exception of one 
or two, according to the number of persons 
dining, should leave the room. 



RELISHES OR APPETISERS 

(Hors d'CEuvre) 

HoRS d'oeuvre are of two kinds — hot 
and cold — and are generally served at the 
commencement of dinner or luncheon, or 
immediately following the soup. 

Cold hors d'oeuvre are composed of 
salted fish, sausage, various salads, or un- 
cooked foods, such as Westphalian ham, 
smoked salmon, and smoked eels. Hot hors 
d'oeuvre are little patties or pasties, rissoles, 
croquettes, and garnished toasts. They are 
served very hot on a daintily folded napkin 
or pretty dish-paper. 

Cold hors d'oeuvre are the more popu- 
lar of the two, because they are so much 
more easily prepared, and can be re-dressed 
and served a second time. The object of 
the hors d'oeuvre is to stimulate the appe- 
tite, and increase the relish for the more 
substantial viands that are to foUow. 

It is usual to serve a small glass of 



12 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

sherry, madeira, vodka, or an American 
cocktail with this course. 

I. BUTTER 

(Beurre) 

Always serve a dish of small pats of 
fresh butter with the hors d'ceuvre, and 
dress with tiny sprigs of parsley. 

2. DRESSED ARTICHOKES 

(Artichauts Poivrade) 

Cut some very young green artichokes 
into quarters, and soak them in cold 
water till fairly soft ; arrange on a dish, 
and pour a thickened French dressing 
(No. 224) over them ; sprinkle a Httle 
chopped parsley, and serve. 

3. CUCUMBER SALAD 

(Concombres en Salade) 

Thinly slice the cucumbers, and mix 



RELISHES OR APPETISERS 13 

lightly with French dressing (No. 224) ; 
sprinkle with some finely-chopped parsley. 



4. PRAWNS 

(Crevettes roses) 

Arrange ten or twelve prawns on a 
bed of parsley, and serve quite plain. 

If an important dinner, remove the plates 
as soon as the prawns are eaten, and place 
a finger-bowl, with a shce of lemon in it, 
and a clean napkin on each plate for each 
guest, taking care to remove the first 
napkin. 

5. CAVIARE (Sturgeoa's Eggs) 
(Caviar) 

The best caviare comes from Astrakhan, 
and can be purchased at most of the leading 
stores and provision dealers'. 

It should be served in the tin or earthen- 
ware bowl in which it has been bought, and 
placed in a receptacle containing ice. A 



14 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 



small tray of quarters of lemon, hot dry 
toast, butter, and finely-chopped onion 
should be handed round with this course. 



6. SARDINE TOAST 

(Canapes aux Sardines) 

Mix a little butter with some Gorgona 
anchovy sauce, and spread on small squares 
or strips of hot toast. 

Skin some sardines, and lay on each 
piece of toast ; place under salamander or in 
the oven a minute or two, squeeze a httle 
lemon on each, and serve. 



7. CAVIARE TOAST 

(Canapes au Caviar) 

Butter some small squares of toast and 
place on each a thin layer of caviare ; serve 
with some chopped onion and lemon separ- 
ately. This hors d'oeuvre can be served 
either hot or cold. 



RELISHES OR APPETISERS 15 

8. ANCHOVY TOAST 

(Canapes aux Anchois) 

Butter a thin piece of hot toast and 
place on it a thin layer of hard-boiled egg- 
yolks which have previously been passed 
through a sieve; add a layer of fillets of 
anchovies, border the edge of the toast 
with finely-chopped parsley, sprinkle a few 
whole capers on top, and serve either hot 
or cold. 



9. TUNNY FISH TOAST 

(Canapfe au Thon marin6) 

Mix some anchovy sauce with some 
butter and spread on hot toast ; cut the 
tunny fish into thin layers and lay on 
toast, leaving a small space between each 
piece of fish ; in these partitions place 
alternately some finely - chopped gher- 
kins and parsley. Cut into small squares 
or long strips, and serve either hot or 
cold. 



i6 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

10. HASHED TUNNY FISH TOAST 
(Canapes au Thon hach6) 

Butter toast as in last recipe, then finely 
chop the tunny fish ; add a shake of cayenne 
pepper and a pinch of salt, and place on toast. 

II. VARIOUS RUSSIAN TOASTS 

(Canapes k la Russe varies) 

These are diffagf't 'Ifckinds of toasts, such 
as caviare, .^Mamn, ;»'*Westphalian ham, or 
any of thosdlist^f given; two or three of 
each dressed oir (jilish, and garnished with 
a little parsley., 

For sij ^ij^riTns prepare, say, four 
squares^ A, ^ of anchovy toast, caviare 
toast, srw'ftd V^s^mon toast, and tunny fish 
toast. 

The m^^cles in the following list require 
little or no ^preparation, and are very easily 
obtainable ; a little parsley, beetroot, or 
thinly-sliced lemon or tomato, arranged 
round the dish, forms all the garnish that 
is necessary.

The following recipes (Nos. 12-15) should 
appeal strongly to my readers, as they exem- 
pUfy the thrift of the cook or housewife. The 
articles required to compose these appetis- 
ing dishes need only be those which remain 



i8 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

from the previous day, and would in many 
households be considered useless, 

12. FISH SALAD 

(Salade de Poisson) 

Bone and remove all the skin of some 
cold boiled fish — such as turbot, sole, cod, 
plaice, eel, or red mullet — and cut as 
nearly as possible into equal squares. 

Take two or three cold boiled potatoes 
to each pound of fish, and cut into thin 
slices and place in a bowl with the fish ; 
then add either cold French beans, cauli- 
flower, peas, tomatoes, or bottoms of 
green artichokes. Chop a little onion and 
parsley very finely, and sprinkle the salad 
with it. 

Now add a thickened French dressing 
(No. 224), and mix together carefully so 
as not to break the potatoes into tiny 
pieces. Place in a salad-bowl and sprinkle 
some finely-chopped beetroot in centre. 
Arrange round the salad-bowl some thinly 
sliced tomatoes and some thin fillets of 



RELISHES OR APPETISERS 19 

anchovies, tapering these to the centre of 
the beetroot. 

A decided improvement is to place 
these salads during the hot months in an 
ice pail for about three-quarters of an hour 
before serving them. 



13. BEEF SALAD 

(Salade de Boeuf) 

Same recipe as the Fish Salad, omitting 
the fillets of anchovies. 

The beef for this salad should be that 
which has been used for making soup or 
gravy; it should be cut into thin strips 
about one inch square. 

A little piccalilli finely chopped in with 
the dressing is a decided improvement. 



14. VEAL SALAD 

(Salade de Veau) 

Is prepared in the same way as the Beef 
Salad. 



20 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

15. CHICKEN SALAD 

(Salade de Poulet) 

Bone and cut into fairly thin strips some 
cold chicken. Then for half a chicken take 
two fairly sized apples and cut into strips 
the same as the chicken. 

Cut some tomatoes into sixteen pieces, 
and mix all together with a Mayonnaise 
sauce (No. 211). 

16. TUNNY FISH SALAD 
(Salade de Thon) 

Same recipe as Chicken Salad (No. 15), 
using tunny fish instead of chicken, omitting 
the apples, and adding capers and chopped 
parsley. 

17. ANCHOVY SALAD 

(Salade d'Anchois) 

Cut some carefully washed Gorgona 
anchovies into fine fillets, and arrange cross- 
wise on dish. 



RELISHES OR APPETISERS 21 

Finely mince white and yellow of an 
egg separately, also some parsley, gherkins, 
and beetroot. Now, with the edge of a 
knife, take a httle of each and place separ- 
ately on each side of the anchovies, putting 
first the chopped white of egg, then 
parsley, then chopped yolk of egg, then 
beetroot. In the centre of each httle 
square of anchovy place a caper, trim edge 
of dish with beetroot cut into tiny ovals, 
and pour a little salad oU into centre. 



18. TOMATO SALAD 

(Salade de Tomates) 

SHce one or two firm tomatoes and 
arrange on oval dish ; sprinkle Ughtly with 
chopped onion, pour a little French 
dressing (No. 224) over centre of tomatoes, 
and sprinkle over this a httle chopped 
parsley. 

This salad may be varied by placing 
alternately sHces of tomato, potato, and 
cucumber. 



22 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

19. NICE SALAD 

(Salade Ni5oise) 

Cut into small, regular p;eces celery, 
tomatoes, potatoes, and French beans, and 
arrange separately in a dish or salad- 
bowl; pour a thickened French dressing 
(No. 224) over, and mix all together just 
before serving. 

20. POTATO SALAD 

(Salade de Pommes) 

Cut some cold boiled potatoes into 
thin slices. Chop some vinegar or mustard 
pickles up very finely, with some onion 
and parsley, and mix all together in a 
bowl with a French dressing (No. 224) ; 
arrange on a dish, sprinkle with some 
chopped parsley or beetroot, and serve. 

2L POTATO AND ANCHOVY SALAD 

(Salade de Pommes aux Anchois) 

Same preparation as last, adding some 



RELISHES OR APPETISERS 23 

finely-chopped anchovies and some fillets 
finely cut arranged on the top, when 
dressed in dish. 

22. RUSSIAN HERRINGS 

(Harengs a la Russe) 

Fillet some raw salted herrings, and 
place for a day or two in oil with some 
sliced onions, cloves, and pepper. 

Make a salad with some cold boiled 
French beans and French dressing (No. 
224), and place on a long oval dish; 
lay two fiUets of herrings on each side 
of the salad, and garnish the sides of 
the herrings with sliced- beetroot and 
tomatoes arranged alternately, and three 
little piles of chopped garlic, onion, and 
parsley round dish. 

25. GORGONA ANCHOVIES 

(Anchois de Glorgona) 

Are purchased in square bottles ; they should 
be well washed in two or three waters, 



24 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 



cleansed and filleted, placed on dish and 
dressed with a little plain salad oil ; 
garnish the edge with parsley and beetroot. 

24. DRESSED EGGS 

((Eufs k la Vinaigrette) 

Cut into quarters or round slices a 
hard-boiled egg for each dish, and dress 
with a thin Mayonnaise sauce (No. 211) into 
which has been worked a little anchovy 
sauce. 

25. STUFFED EGGS 

((Eufs farcis) 

Cut three or four hard-boiled eggs in 
halves and remove the yellow, taking care 
not to break the white ; cut a thin slice 
from the bottom of each, so that they 
stand upright. 

Mash the yellow up finely in a plate 
with a fork, add a little cayenne, anchovy 
sauce, half minced gherkin, and Mayonnaise 
sauce (No. 211) ; mix all together to a 



RELISHES OR APPETISERS 25 

firm paste, and replace in the halves of 
white with a teaspoon; garnish the dishes 
with a little beetroot. 

26. JELLIED EGGS 

((Eufs poches a la Gelee) 

Pour some good jelly soup, either of 
veal or chicken, to which has been added a 
little gelatine, into a suitable dish (a round 
one is best) ; add two or three soft 
poached eggs, and place on the ice over- 
night. It should be jellied in the morning. 

27. CANTALOUP MELON 

(Melon Cantaloup) 

The finest melons come from Cantalupo, 
in Italy, whence they derive their name ; 
the rock melon, which comes from America, 
is so very similar that only a connoisseur 
can detect the difference. 

Place the melon in a big bowl with 
small chunks of ice at least one hour 
before serving. 



26 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

Cut from the centre of one side to the 
centre of the other, remove the pips or 
seeds, and cut a thin slice of the rind from 
the bottom, so that it will stand upright; 
serve with powdered sugar, salt and 
pepper or powdered ginger. 



SOUPS 
CLEAR SOUPS 

28. BEEF BROTH 

(Pot-au-Feu) 

This soup is one that finds most 
favour with the bourgeoise, or French 
housewife, forming, as it does, a most 
nourishing and sustaining food. It is at 
the same time very economical, as the 
meat utilised is afterwards served as a 
dish, with the vegetables arranged around, 
or is converted into Beef Salad (No. 13). 

The beef most suitable is the hind- 
quarter or shoulder, which should be boned 
and bound together with string ; the bones 
can also be boiled at the same time. 

Put the meat in an earthenware or 
enamelled saucepan, add some chicken giblets 
and the bones of the meat, cold water, and 
rough, ordinary salt. 

Place the saucepan on the fire and allow 
27 



28 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

to boil, skimming off the fat as it rises. 
As soon as the water boils, add a glass of 
cold water and continue to skim off the 
fat; when it has boiled again, withdraw to 
edge of fire and allow to simmer for four 
or five hours with the lid partly tilted. 

After it has simmered for two and a 
half hours, add carrots, leeks, and, finally, 
some chervil ; plenty of vegetables should 
be used, and they should be quite fresh, as 
the parts that are not dissolved in the 
soup will be afterwards served with the beef. 

Remove the beef from the soup, place 
it on a hot dish, and arrange some carrots 
and leeks round the meat; keep warm by 
the side of the fire, and serve later on with 
a separate dish of boiled potatoes and a 
remoulade sauce (No. 210). 

Cut a few of the vegetables into thin 
slices and place in the bottom of the soup 
tureen ; pass the soup either through a fine 
sieve or a coarse linen cloth into a basin; 
add three or four drops of essence of 
caramel to clarify it, pour into tureen, and 
serve very hot. 



SOUPS 29 

29. CLEAR SOUP AND VEGETABLES 

(Croute au Pot) 

This soup is prepared in the same way 
as Beef Broth (No. 28), with some small 
round pieces of French bread or roUs (which 
have been previously baked in the oven) 
served separately. 

30. CLEAR CHICKEN AND BEEF SOUP 

(Petite Mannite) 

For this soup it is essential to have 
a marmite, or earthenware saucepan, which 
can be purchased at any of the leading 
stores or French fournisseurs. 

Put into the marmite from one to two 
poimds of lean beef cut into inch cubes, 
and the uncooked legs and wings (the 
second joints) of one or two chickens; add 
some veed or chicken gravy, fill the mar- 
mite with cold water, add some salt and 
a httle pepper, and allow to come to the 
boil ; withdraw to the side of the fire, and let 
simmer very slowly for from three to four 



30 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

hours. Now add the heart of a white 
cabbage firmly tied with string, some small 
carrots and young turnips. 

When the vegetables are all thoroughly 
cooked, put the marmite on a plate and 
serve. Some thin slices of either French 
bread or roll should have been previously 
baked crisp. 

In serving, cut the beef and the 
chicken into small pieces and place two or 
three of each of the vegetables on the plate 
with three or four of the sHces of baked 
bread.

EGGS 

The luncheon menu of the fashionable 
hotel or restaurant is considered incomplete 
without mention of at least one dish com- 
posed mainly of eggs. 

There are, of course, hundreds of recipes 
for cooking eggs. Some of these are expen- 
sive to carry out, and call for great patience 
and skill on the part of the cook. Others, 
though quite simple, are yet exceedingly 
dainty, and it is from this last class of 
recipe that I have chosen the following 
examples. 

It is possible to purchase at any good 
household store a number of tiny porcelain 
dishes made on purpose to hold single 
eggs. These little dishes are either round 
or oval in shape ; they cost a mere trifle, 
and are an invaluable aid towards the pro- 
duction of many of the following dishes. 
Eggs cooked in this way are sent to table 
in the small bowls, and there is thus 

73 



74 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

neither the risk nor the trouble of turning 
them out and re-serving. 



113. PLAIN FRIED EGGS 

(CEufs au Plat) 

Melt a little butter in sotne of the small 
dishes ; break into them one or two eggs 
to each person, being very careful that the

on top of the stove till cooked. 



114. FRIED EGGS AND SAUSAGES

stove till cooked. Pour a little hot, thick 
tomato sauce (No. 203) round edge of dish, 
and serve.

134. PLAIN OMELET 

(Omelette Nature) 

It is not often that one makes a complete 
success of the first omelet, but the young 
housewife who essays this delicate form of 
cookery must not be discouraged. Even if 
the first omelet is a comparative failure, 
it is almost certain that, with patient 
attention to the following instructions, 
the fifth or sixth attempt will be a decided 
success. 

Butter a frjang - pan, beat the eggs 
(seasoned with salt and pepper) and pour 
into the frying-pan, stir briskly with a 
fork, and as soon as the eggs begin to 
set, tilt the pan on one side, and work 
the eggs together with the fork, till the 
omelet assumes an oblong shape and is 
evenly united. 

Now drop the omelet on to a dish by 
placing the dish on the uneven part of the 
eggs and turning the pan on to the dish, 
thus getting the smooth side uppermost; 
trim the edges and serve.

ROASTS 

It is unnecessary to detail each of the dif- 
ferent varieties of meat, poultry, and game, 
as all flesh is prepared and roasted in pretty 
much the same way, and the cook can 
easily judge by the appearance and tender- 
ness of the meat whether or not it is 
sufficiently cooked. 

Meat such as beef, mutton, lamb, or 
veal should be floured and seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and the cook should be 
careful that the joint is occasionally basted, 
turned, and cooked equally on both sides. 
It should be of a moist and juicy appear- 
ance when dished to go on the table. 

In the case of game or poultry, do not 
let the oven be too brisk, and baste more 
frequently than when roasting meat. Should 
game be " too high " to suit the diner, the 
objection may be partly removed by plac- 
ing a red-hot poker in the interior for one 
or two seconds. For poultry, put some salt 

135 



136 



EASY FRENCH COOKERY 



inside the bird : this removes any staleness 
when cooked. 

Game should not be over-cooked, and in 
the case of woodcock, wild duck, etc., 
should be under-done. 

I give here a list of some of the varie- 
ties of meat, game, and poultry most suit-

The oven in which the roasting takes 
place should not be too hot, as, if it is, the 
meat becomes burnt outside and is raw 
inside. Nevertheless, the oven should be 
sufficiently hot to demand and receive con- 
stant attention, as any joint that is being 
roasted needs to be frequently basted and 
occasionally turned. 

The proper way to truss a fowl and 
to carve poultry is clearly shown by the 
accompanying illustrations.

perfection, as, should the directions not be 
minutely followed, the omelet will not be a 
success. 

Break six eggs, one at a time, into a 
plate and separate the white and yellow; 
place in two basins. 

Mix with the yellow four spoonfuls of 
powdered sugar and whip for ten minutes, 
always turning the whisk in the same 
direction ; then add four finely minced 
almonds. 

Add a pinch of salt to the white, and 
whip till a stifiish froth has formed. 

Take another basin and put half the 
yellow in with half the white ; now add the 
rest of the yellow and the rest of the white, 
and beat lightly togef^ier. 

Butter a long, flat, oval dish, place the 
whipped eggs in it, arrange into shape with 
a knife, and bake in a moderate oven till 
dehcately brown. 

This souffle should take fifteen to twenty- 
five minutes to cook. Sprinkle a little 
powdered sugar on the top, and serve im- 
mediately.

ICES 

HOW TO FREEZE ICES 

A FREEZING apparatus consists of an ice- 
tub with a hole and a peg in it, an ice-pot, 
and an ice-spoon. 

The freezer, properly cleaned, is placed 
in the centre of the tub, and is surrounded 
with small chunks of ice and two or three 
handfuls of freezing salt. 

Pour into the central receptacle the pre- 
paration which you wish to freeze, lay a 
piece of white paper on the top and put the 
Ud on. 

Turn the handle from right to left con- 
tinuously for fifteen minutes or thereabouts ; 
then remove the lid, and with the spoon 
work the frozen mixture from the sides of 
the ice-pot to the centre; repeat the turn- 
ing tin the contents have become firm, 
when the ice is ready for serving.

a firm appearance, and should not be over- 
cooked so as to become pasty.) Let cook

to prevent burning. 

A little dish of finely-grated Parmesan 
cheese should be served separately, as an 
accompaniment to the macaroni.

FRENCH AND TURKISH COFFEE 

The connoisseur of to-day invariably looks 
for a cup of really good coffee to follow 
immediately after luncheon or dinner ; but, 
curiously enough, one is seldom served with 
delicious coffee in a private house. 

Only the best coffee shoiild be bought, 
and it should be freshly ground before 
being used. A French earthenware coffee- 
pot should be used, for it is easily kept 
clean and is always presentable. The coffee- 
cups should be warmed either in boiling 
water or in the oven. 

320. BLACK COFFEE 

(Cafe Noir) 

Rinse the coffee-pot with hot water, 
allow a heaped teaspoonful of coffee to 
each person, and place on top filter of pot ; 
pour boiling water over and allow to run 
through, which will take some time, but it 

i86 



FRENCH AND TURKISH COFFEE 187 

should not be disturbed, otherwise the coffee 
will have a thick and muddy appearance. 
Should it not be strong enough, add a little 
more coffee and repass. 

321. EXTRA BLACK COFFEE 

(Cafe Double) 

Should a very strong cup of coffee be 
required, after having allowed the first 
filtering refill the filter with fresh coffee and 
repass the coffee that has just been made. 

322. COFFEE WITH MILK 

(Cafe au Lait) 

Make some coffee as in No. 320, and 
serve with a jug of boihng milk, placing 
a little whipped cream on the top of the 
milk. 

323. TURKISH COFFEE 

(Cafe k la Turque) 

Here the hostess has an opportunity of 



i88 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

displaying her ability and charm, as it is 
fashionable to make this coffee at the same 
table that one has dined at, or on small 
copper-covered tables that are sold for the 
purpose. 

The whole Turkish outfit is a very pretty 
ornament to a dining-room, and occupies 
very Uttle space. 

It consists of a small round or square 
table, tiny china cups and cup-stands, 
three or four copper pots in which to make 
the coffee, a spirit lamp, and coffee and 
sugar receptacles, and the whole may be 
bought for fifteen shillings and upwards. 

Light the lamp and boil some water in 
a pot, leaving sufficient space at top to 
allow for boiling ; just before the water begins 
to boil, put in and stir one or two teaspoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar to each person, 
according to taste. When the water has 
boiled, remove from lamp and stir and mix 
weU a teaspoonful of Turkish coffee to each 
person, replace on lamp and, stirring slowly, 
allow to come to the boil again ; when it 
boils, remove from lamp for a second or two 



TURKISH COFFEE 189 

and cease stirring. Boil for third time and 
add a dash of cold water to cause the grounds 
to settle quickly ; serve in the tiny cups, 
which must have been previously warmed. 
Hand round Turkish cigarettes to complete 
the Oriental effect. 

The coffee required is not the same 
as that used for French Coffee ; it is roasted 
for a longer time, and is ground into a very 
fine powder. It can be purchased at most 
of the leading stores, and should be asked 
for as " Turkish Coffee." 



CHAMPAGNES, WINES, LIQUEURS 
AND CUPS 

Luncheon or dinner wines, to be served 
correctly, should appear at their proper times. 
Thus one would not commence to serve with 
port and terminate with sherry. Hock, 
Moselle or Ught claret is considered most 
suitable for lunch. Some prefer beer — hght 
lager or Pilsener. A very good variation 
is to make a Ught Rhine or claret cup. 

For dinner, should it be on an elaborate 
scale and many different wines be required, 
pass with the various dishes as follows : — 

Hors d'oeuvre and A glass of sherry or 

soup cocktail. 

Fish . . . Hock or MoseUe. 

First entree . . Claret. 

Second entree . Claret or Burgundy. 
Roast, to end of 

dinner . . Champagne. 

Dessert . . . Light port 

Coffee . . . Various hqueurs. 

igo 



WINES, LIQUEURS AND CUPS 191 

The offering of so many different wines 
does not tend, in my opinion, to the 
enjoyment and comfort of the guests, es- 
pecially if their taste runs to simplicity, 
and I always advocate a glass of sherry, 
and then either a good claret or champagne 
to the end of the dinner, liqueurs being 
passed with the coffee. 

White Bordeaux and Burgundies, hocks. 
Moselles and champagnes should always be 
slightly iced before serving ; the cellar 
should be kept at a temperature of sixty 
degrees, and a draught through it will ensure 
its being always cool. 

Clarets and Burgundies should always " 
be warmed a little to remove the abruptness 
found in even very good and expensive 
wine when served cold. Another way is to 
decant, cork, and place on the table for an 
hour before the dinner; the warmth of the 
room will then do all that is necessary. 

Liqueurs are now becoming quite fashion- 
able, and a tiny glass of liqueur brandy is 
almost always looked for by the habitual 
good diner. 



192 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

To abuse liqueurs by over-indulgence in 
them is, of course, to be deprecated ; but a 
tiny glass of good brandy, or, in fact, of 
almost any of the hundred-and-one liqueurs 
that are on the market, does no harm, 
makes one quite contented with oneself, and 
may promote and aid digestion, many 
liqueurs being fabricated with that object 
in view. 

To serve, at the beginning of the meal, 
a glass of sherry and Angostura, orange 
bitters, French or Italian vermouth, or 
one of the many different American 
cocktails (the favourites of which are the 
Martini or Manhattan), is also a little courtesy 
on the part of the host or hostess that should 
not be omitted, as the cocktail promotes 
appetite and prepares the stomach for the 
repast that is to follow. 

A hock. Moselle, French white wine, 
claret, cider or champagne cup is a delight- 
fully refreshing and cooling drink for lunch 
or dinner during the hot months, and is 
very easily prepared, the recipes being as 
follows : — 



WINES, LIQUEURS AND CUPS 193 

324. HOCK. MOSELLE OR FRENCH 
WHITE WINE CUP 

Pour one bottle of wine into a glass jug, 
add a liqueur glass of Maraschino, one of 
brandy, and one of Curagoa, a strip of 
cucumber-peel, two slices of lemon, two 
slices of orange, some fruits (such as 
peaches, strawberries, raspberries, or red- 
currants), a sprig of borage, and half a 
syphon of soda-water. Should the cup be 
required very sweet, put a liqueur glass and a 
half of Maraschino, half a liqueur glass of 
brandy, and a Uttle powdered sugar ; should it 
be preferred not sweet, put a glass and a half 
of brandy and half a glass of Maraschino. 
Add chunks of ice, shake well, and serve. 

325. CLARET CUP 

Made in the same way as No. 324, 
using claret instead of white wine, and 
adding a tablespoonful of sugar. 

326. CHAMPAGNE CUP 

Two liqueur glasses of brandy, one of 



194 EASY FRENCH COOKERY 

Curagoa, fruits, lemon, orange, borage, soda- 
water, ice, and tWo drops of Angostura 
bitters. Proceed as in No. 324. 

327. CIDER CUP. 

To one bottle>,of cider add two liqueur 
glasses of gin, one of Cura9oa, four drops of 
Angostura ; fruits, ice, etc., as for No. 324.
