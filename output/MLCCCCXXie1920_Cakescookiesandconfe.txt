LOS ANGELES :: MLCCCCXX 



SO insistent has been the demand for more 
copies of "Cakes, Cookies and Confections," 
that the committee, supported by the entire 
California Home Economics Association, Southern 
Section, has decided to present to you this second 
edition. The booklet has been revised, and reci- 
pes of special merit have been added. 




Foreword 



HIS new collection of recipes is added to 
the thousands of existing cook books, large 
and small, in the confidence that the plan 
of organization has struck a new note of simplicity 
which together with the many unusual recipes, 
will commend it, either for use in the home or to 
the teacher. It grew out of the assurance that in 
the ranks of those two groups, there is a demand 
for just such a book, organized for ready use and 
comprehensive understanding. 

Each recipe might be stamped "Tested and 
Guaranteed." Our Association stands back of 
them. Both the preparation and "taste" have 
been thoroughly tested by a varied group. They 
have been prepared by inexperienced pupils, as 
well as by skillful home cooks and teachers. The 
sampling has passed the muster of man, woman 
and child. 

This is only a beginning, a sample, as it were. 



If it fills a want, if it meets with your approval, 
similar issues on varied subjects of interest to the 
home will be forthcoming. We shall be grateful 
if you will let us know your desire in the matter. 
Send us your suggestions, please.

INGE perfection in the completed cake 
does not depend alone on the ingredients 
and their proper proportions ,it is advis- 
able that all who use this booklet read the follow- 
ing suggestions: 

Utensils 

A few well selected pieces of equipment are 
absolutely necessary to the best success of these 
recipes. It is true that edible cakes and cookies 
can be obtained with the make shift of the average 
kitchen, but not the successful product intended.

Standard teaspoon (3 to 1 tbsp). 

Wooden spoon for mixing. 

Steel case knife for removing baked cakes.. 
(Spatula not best for this.) 

Glass measuring cup. 

Aluminum measuring cup. 

Egg whip or wire whisk. 

Egg beater of the wheel or Dover type (Not a 
cheap one.) 

Crockery bowls. 

Limber spatula to remove cake batter. (Not 



CAKES, COOKIES AND CONFECTIONS 

necessary, but a great convenience.) 

Flour sifter. 

Cake rack on which to cool cakes, bread, etc. 
The wire shelf of the refrigerator is a good sub- 
stitute. 

"Turk's Head" cake pan for large cakes, as 
fruit or sponge. (Has hole in center.) 

Tin or aluminum cake pan about 7x11x2 inches. 
(Suitable for cakes of the "Novelty type.")

ing the cake. 

Abbreviations 

tsp. teaspoon, 
tbsp. tablespoon. 
c. cup. 
Ib. pound, 
pt. pint. 
oz. ounce. 

Equivalents 

All measurements are leveled by knife moved 
forward at right angles to spoon or cup. Do not 
pack. Flour is sifted once before measuring. Use

no favorite "coffee" or "tea" cups or dessert 
spoons ! 

3 tsp. equals 1 tbsp. 
16 tbsp. equals 1 cup. 

(When measuring molasses, sour milk, or other 
liquids and fat, always remove surplus clinging to 
spoon before calling it a measured table spoon.) 

2 c. liquid equals 1 pt. 

2 c. sugar equals 1 Ib. 

2 c. fat equals 1 Ib. 

4 c. flour equals 1 Ib. 
16 oz. equals 1 Ib. 

Mixing 

With the exception of true sponge, cakes de- 
pend for their lightness upon the gas generated 
when the baking powder combines with liquid in- 
gredients. Therefore do not beat the batter any 
longer than to thoroughly mix it, or the gas will 
be lost and a heavy, compact mass results. A bet- 
ter method is to reserve two tablespoons of the 
flour and sift it with the baking powder into 
the well beaten batter before the whites are folded 
in. Long beating before addition of the leavener 
tends to make a more even grained texture. 

Flour 

To obtain a fine even texture, use one of the es- 
pecially prepared cake flours on the market, or 
make your own pastry flour by substituting two 
tablespoons of cornstarch for two of flour in each 
cup of sifted flour. This always gives better re- 
sults than bread flour though the cake dries out 
more readily.

Effects of Various Ingredients 

In making an untested recipe for the first time it 
is interesting to know that: 

1. If the cake has a gummy surface with a 
tendency to fall, an excess of sugar was used. 

2. If there are heavy streaks and a friable 
crumb, too much fat was used. 

3. A dry, bready cake is the result of too much 
flour. 

4. An excess of baking powder makes a porous 
cake which falls easily. 

5. An excess of egg gives tendency to tough- 
ness and produces "tunnels." 

Baking 

If all else has been observed and the cake is 
carelessly baked, failure is usually the reward. 
One should learn the good and bad points of the 
oven used and act accordingly. 

The cake is usually placed in the center of the 
oven. A large square of asbestos insures against 
burning on the bottom. The top shelf of the oven 
is used for browning. 

An over thermometer, purchasable for a small 
sum, does away with guess work if one records 
results of each baking.

Tests When Done 

A cake may be tested in three ways : 

a. When it shrinks from the sides of the pan. 

b. When a straw inserted comes out without 
any dough adhering. 

c. When lightly touched the dent does not 
remain. 

Leave sponge cakes in pan till cold. Other 
cakes may be removed to cake rack to cool. 
All cakes cut best with a wet knife. 

CAKES WITH FAT 

Two methods may be employed in mixing. 
Cake method of mixing: 

1. Cream fat and sugar. 

2. Add egg yolk well beaten. 

3. Mix and sift dry ingredients and add al- 

ternately with liquid. 



C AK E S, C O O K I E S AND CONFECTIONS 

4. Fold in beaten whites. 
Quick or Muffin method of mixing: 

1. Soften fat and add to liquids. 

2. Mix and sift dry ingredients. 

3. Combine 1 and 2. 

Both methods are satisfactory for plain cakes. 
Most butter cakes are a reduction or slight vari- 
tion of the One, Two, Three, Four Cake, which 
consists of: 

1/2 to 1 c. fat 3 c. flour 
2 c. sugar 4 tsp. baking powder 

4 eggs 1 tsp. vanilla 

1 c. milk 

This makes a satisfactory loaf or layer cake. 
Bakes to perfection as a loaf in fireless cooker in 
1^4 hours with stones at 350 F. 

Standard Proportions 

6 tbsp. fat iy% c. flour 

1 c. sugar 2 tsp. baking powder 

2 eggs 1 tsp. vanilla 
1/2 c. milk 

Mix either method.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR 
CANDY MAKING 

Candy making is one of the keenest pleasures 
to all concerned, but it requires for its success 
accuracy, and some knowledge of the materials 
with which one works. The following sugges- 
tions are offered the amateur so that he may bet- 
ter understand what he is trying to produce and 
how best to get the desired results. 

White granulated sugar is the basis for almost 
all candy. When heated slowly without water it 
gradually changes to a colorless syrup, but as the 
heat increases this changes to a light brown and 
then a dark brown syrup. This latter is known as 
caramel sugar and is less sweet than the original 
sugar. It is used in cooking for flavoring syrups, 
desserts, and candy; the melted sugar usually 
being boiled with water until it is completely dis- 
solved. 

Sandy or coarse grained candy is produced by 
short boiling- stirring or agitating the syrup, or 
by beating while the candy is yet warm. 

Creamy, velvety candy is produced by long, 
slow boiling ; the addition of an acid such as cream 
of tartar, molasses, brown sugar, vinegar, etc., 
cooling before handling; or the addition of a 
simple sugar such as glucose, caramel sugar or 
honey. 

As crystals spread from one to another, never 
scrape a kettle where a non-crystalline candy- 
such as taffy, butter-scotch, etc., is desired.

CAKES, COOKIES AND CONFECTIONS 

Milk is often used by the home candy maker, 
but excellent candy is made with water and it is 
much easier to handle. The casein of milk has a 
tendency to stick and hence burn to the bottom of 
the kettle, while if water is used this is avoided 
and a slight increase in the amount of butter 
makes the product as rich as with milk. 

The success of candy making depends largely 
upon careful testing so as to know when to remove 
the syrup. A sugar thermometer is desirable, 
but if one is testing with a spoon even greater 
care should be given. Have pans greased and 
nuts prepared before beginning to cook the syrup 
so that undivided attention can be given to testing. 
Test only a small amount, one or two drops at a 
time, in cold water. When it begins to test remove 
gently from the flame while testing so that the 
candy will not overcook while the test is being 
made. 

These temperatures vary with atmospheric con- 
ditions. 

Tests: The thread 216F.-218 F. 
The pearl 220 F. 
The blow 230 F. 
The feather 232F.-235F. 
Soft ball 236F.-240F. 
Large or firm ball 248 F .-250 
The crack 290F.-310F. 
Caramel 350 F. 

The Soft Ball 

Test a few drops of the syrup in cold water. 
When the small ball will hold its shape enough 

54 



C AKE S, C O O KIE S AND CONFECTIONS 

so that it can be picked up and rolled between 
the thumb and forefinger without sticking it has 
reached the soft ball test. 

Hard or Firm Balls 

Test as for soft ball, but the syrup should be 
firmer and hold any shape it is pressed into. It 
should not be brittle or crack, but firm between 
the thumb and forefinger. 

The Crack 

This is slightly harder than the firm ball. The 
test should ring against the side of the cup, and 
some of it should break with a slight snap. It 
should not stick to the teeth. 

The hard crack will quickly set hard and easily 
snap. 

The Caramel 

The caramel stage is reached when all the 
water has boiled out and the syrup begins to dis- 
color slightly. It should be removed from the fire 
at once to prevent burning and set in a pan of 
cold water to stop its cooking.

Boil sugar and water slowly until it forms a firm 
ball when tested in cold water. Add coloring, stir 
well' and then pour very slowly over popped corn 
while stirring corn vigorously. Each kernel should 
be coated with sugar. This is an excellent recipe 
for making sugared popcorn in large quantities 
for Xmas stockings. The coloring may be varied, 
or larger proportion of corn to syrup if desired. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Peel of 6 oranges. Cover with cold water, bring

thoroughly. Remove excess white with spoon, 
cut in strips with scissors. Boil 2 c. sugar and 1 c. 
water until it threads. Add peel and let boil 
until syrup is boiled away. Watch carefully. Add 
1 c. sugar and stir with fork until crystallized. 
Spread on wax paper to dry. 

Grapefruit Novelties 

1 Ib. grape fruit peel 2 c. water 
IVk Ibs. sugar 

Select bright fruit with thick peel. Wash with 
brush. Grate very lightly with an ordinary grater 
to break cells. Cut the peel in quarters, remove 
from fruit and weigh it. 

Cut again into strips or fancy shapes. For each 



C A K E S, C O O K I E S AND CONFECTIONS 

quart of peel add 3 pints of cold water. Boil ten 
minutes and pour off the water. Repeat six or 
eight times or until as much of the bitter flavor 
is removed as is desired. Dry peel between folds 
of cloth, pressing gently. 

To each pound of peel take 11/2 Ibs. sugar and 
2 cups water. Bring syrup to a boil and cook until 
sugar is dissolved. Add prepared peel and cook 
until syrup is absorbed. This may be told by the 
formation of sugar crystals in the clear peel. 
Sometimes, however, there is danger of cooking 
too long and the resulting product is hard and 
unattractive. When the peel begins to cook thick 
like a preserve, try rolling a piece in granulated 
sugar after draining well. If this stiffens on cool- 
ing, the whole product is ready to drain and roll 
in the granulated sugar. 

The pulp may be removed from the whole 
grapefruit shell and it crystallized or various 
heart, lozenges or other shapes cut out and dif- 
ferent vegetable colorings added to the syrup.

Put ingredients in smooth saucepan and stir 
until sugar is dissolved and mixture begins to boil. 
Boil without stirring until soft ball is formed when 
tested in cold water or 240 F. During boiling 
cover 2 minutes so as to dissolve crystals on the 
sides of the kettle. When cooked pour fondant in 
clean bowl, do not scrape kettle, as scrapings will 
"sugar." When almost cold beat with wooden 
spoon until white and creamy. Knead with hands 
until perfectly smooth. Pack in jars to ripen, 
about 24 hours or cover with cloth dipped in hot 
water and wring dry. 

If cooked too long or not long enough, if grainy 
and not creamy, add water and cook over again 
as if fondant were sugar. 

This fondant lends itself to endless ways of 
making up and is the basis for all French creams. 
It is used to stuff dates, figs, prunes, etc., as cen- 
ters for chocolate creams, etc.

angles to the other cut. 

The filling may be varied and colored to suit, 
and the outside may have more or less molasses 
used to lend variety. 

Chocolate Creams 

The chocolate used for dipping has more of the 
cocoa butter left in than the commercial bar choc- 
olate and is often sweetened. The home candy

maker may buy bars of dipping chocolate at most 
groceries or candy kitchens. Baker's "Dot" choco- 
late is very satisfactory for this purpose. 

Melt the chooclate slowly over hot water, be- 
ing very careful to get no water into it, and re- 
move from fire as soon as thoroughly melted. If 
water gets into the chocolate it thickens and 
lumps. If it gets too hot it streaks and grays as 
it cools. 

The centers of chocolate creams are usually 
made from fondant, colored, flavored and shaped. 
After the shapes have hardened and dried a few 
hours exposed to the air, they are dipped in the 
melted chocolate with a fork or hat pin, or the fin- 
gers, and allowed to dry slowly on wax paper. 
Soft fondant centers may be made by adding more 
cream of tartar as the centers are shaped, and 
after dipping allow them to ripen 3-4 weeks be- 
fore using. 

Raisins, roasted almonds, peanuts, oyster crack- 
ers, etc., may be dipped in the chocolate and give 
a very delicious variation to a box of chocolate 
creams.
