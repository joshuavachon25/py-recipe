[A paper read by Mrs. Montrew Sanders on the occasion of the opening of the 
basement of the church] 

"Where there is no vision the people perish" are the words that were 
spoken by one who was in close contact with human life in its various con- 
flicts and triumphs. That inactivity is followed by retrogression and that 
circumscribed vision results in loss of power and opportunity, is a fixed 
law in the spiritual realm as well as in the physical. 

Thousands of churches in America to-day have ceased to be bulwarks 
of power in extending the kingdom of our Christ, simply because the 
membership was content with small things. Hundreds of churches are 
closed and are mouldering away by tbe roadside, because the congregations 
lacked a vision of a larger field atid were unwilling to pay the price of a 
larger growth and an increased power of evangelism. These empty church 
houses, where once the gospel of love was proclaimed by men whose hearts 
were aglow with heavenly fervor, and where the struggling multitudes 
gathered in from the various walks of life in order that they might receive 
spiritual food and guidance, have now become mere habitations for the 
straying bird that seeks refuge from the disturbed elements. The faithful, 
along with the aged trustees and loyal members, have either passed on to 
their reward or lapsed into lethargy and inditTerenoe. The young men and 
maidens spend their hours in frivolty and pleasure. The boys and girls 
roam the fields and loiter on the streets. The heart of the parent becomes 
burdened, and their eyes send forth tears of anguish on account of the iu- 
ditferennce and waywardness of their children. When we seek to find out 
the cause of all this, we invariably find that it is a process of spiritual de- 
generation and decay that had already begun as the result of a failure on 
the part of the christian forces in those communities to break away from 
obsolete customs and antiquated methods, and keep apace with the pro- 
gressive spirit of the age by attempting larger things for the cause of 
Christ. 

We, as members and friends of this part of the christian church have 
learned some practical and very helpful lessons along this line during the 
last few years. All of us can remember when the congregations which as- 



sembled for worship in this village from time to time were content with 
quite crude and commonplace facilities for the promotion of religious wor- 
ship and the extension of gospel privileges. No matter how comfortable 
and cuzy might be our own firesides, we thought little about it if the housfe 
of God was not in harmony with our homes. We saw the hand of pnjgrebs 
as it wrought its mighty transformation as if by the touch of magic, in 
other phases of human endeavor, but we realized that the church was not 
keeping pace. Tiere came a time however, when conditions began to 
change — a brighter day was dawning, and a new star was appearing in tlie 
spiritual heavens which destined to shed its sombre light over the entire 
community, giving new hope and new life to all who would come under the 
influence of its marvellous power. I refer to the larger vision that has 
come to this church in rejeut 3'ears, and tne rem^irkable growth and material 
enlargement that followed, the culmination of which we meet here to-night 
to celebrate. 

In the worthy achievements of the past few years the women 
of the church have borne a noble part. They have stood side by side wiih 
their sturdy brothers in an united etfort to plant the church upon a higher 
plane and a firmer foundation. The organized work among the women of 
the church had its inoeption about five ) ears ago, when a number of the 
women in this community met in the old church, which formerly stood up- 
on this sacred spot, and organized the Ladies' Aid Society of this church 
wtih eighteen members enrolled at the first meeting. Mrs. Sallie Edwards was 
elected president Plans were inaugurated and put into practical opeiation 
which had as th;; chief (jhject the assuming of part of the re^jponsibility of 
providing funds for the support and extension of various departments of 
the work of the church. The ladies entered into their new labors with a 
spirit of fervency and cheer, and in a very short time tje Aid Society be. 
came one of the leading faetois in the church life. 

A few months after the society entered upon its useful career, some 
one sus^gested fhat Honey Creek should have a resident pastor. The idea 
was a popidar one, and the Aid Society took up the discussion, and con- 
tinued the agitation which resulted in definite steps being taken towa'-d tiie 
building of a home for the pastor of the church. The society came for- 
ward wlien the success of ihe enterprise was in jeopardy and pledged 
$100 00 to a'u\ in building the parsonage. It was a glad day for the society 
as well as for the entire church when the pastor and his fajnily were moved 
into the new parsonage, the first house of iis kind in the village 

With the completion of the parsonage, and the spirit of sacrifice and 
service that the society developed in their efforts to provide their part of 
the funds, came a still lartrer vision of greater opportunities. When a new 
house of worship was proposed, the Aid Society was not found laokins in 
support ami enthusiasm A pledge at $500.00 was ma.irt before the build- 
ing was begun. The greater [)art of this sum was paid before the church 



was completed. An additional sum of $200 00 wa% pledged on the day of 
dedication, and now the society is expecting to bear the greater part of the 
responsibility of providing for funds for the completion of the basement. 
About $400.00 more will be expended for these improvements, which will 
make the entire amount expended by the society during the last Ave years, 
something near $1200.00 As to how this large sum of money has been 
collected, almost every person in the community understands. The women 
have been toiling arduously, early and late and in many ways, in order that 
they might carry forward the work that lay so near their hearts Practi- 
cally the entire community has encouraged them in a substantial way, and 
the splendid work that has been accomplished is due largely to the hearty 
support received from the many friends of the socioty, all of which h is 
been greatly appreciated by those who have had the work in hand. 

Friends, it has been a long, hard pull. There were times when the 
roads were not smooth, and the "weather was not pleasant. There were 
conditions that made it embarassing for us to carry on our work Throb- 
bing heads and aching limbs have told the frequent story of a day of in- 
cessant toil, but a full purse when the day's work was over, caused a joyous 
spirit. The burden ot the responsibility has been .great and many times 
seemed more than we could bear; but in the midst of all our sacrifice and 
labors, we have been happy and hopeful, realizing our labors were for Him, 
who gave his life for us. As we sit here to-night amidst these beautiful 
and pleasant surroundings beneath the roof of this splendid temple dedicat- 
ed to the worship of Almighty God, we glance backward over the pathway 
over which we have traveled and see how the way has been opened up for 
our advancement and realize that the hand of the loving B'ather has guided 
us to this present hour of victory and promise. 

Does it pay? Have our labors been in vain? Nay! Nay! All our 
labors, all our sacrifices and all our energies have been transformed into 
bulwarks of spiritual power and have become pillars in the temple of our 
God. Our work is only begun. This enlarged vision will carry us into 
new and larger fields of endeavor. Let us not relax. Let every step be 
forward and upward, until the last battle is fought, and the victor's crown 
is placed upon our brow. Then-^perhaps not until then, will we kaow the 
real joy of unselfish service. Then we will forget all about our conflicts, 
our conquests, and our crosses, for we will hear again the beautiful wonA 
which were spoken at Bothany, ''She hath done what she couli"

The Baking of Bread 

TliG oven should bo hot cnoiijih to turn a piece of while paper a dark 
brown in five minutes for the baliing of bread, The heat should inoreaso 
HJightly for the first ten roinutes, and gradually deerease tiU the end of the 
baking. The heat in the center of the loaf should roaoh 213 degrees, other- 
wise the starch cells will not be ruptured or the ferment jjerms killed. The 
heat changes the starch on the exterior of the loaf to dextrine. If it burns, 
the dextrine is turned into oararael, and has a slightly bitter taste. When 
the loaf is removed from the oven, place it where the air will circulate free- 
ly around it. Do not cover, if you like a crisp crust. When cold put it 
into a clean, sweet bread-i)ox, without any wrapping, as the latter will give 
it a musty fl ivor. The pan for baking bread should not be over four 
inciios wide, four inches deep, and suited in lentrth to the oven When the 
loaf is larger than this, there is danger of the temperature in the center of 
thf loiif i!0t reaching 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and the yea^t germs not be- 
ing kdicd. • — Sele(!ted,

1q small pieces and soaked in cold water for half an hour to draw out the

cover and simmer slowly for a number of hours. Stock is better when 
made the day before it is to be used. — Selected.

Saratoga Chips 

Tbe secret of preparing this daiunty dish mcoly, lies in cutting the 
slices to the thinness of heavy paper and soaking them in cold water, with 
a pinch of powdered alum added, not less than six hours. Moon, the 
originator, is said to have soaked thera in ice water twelve hours. This is 
done to draw the starch from the potato. When you are leady to fry 
them, drain them from the water and dry with a cloth. Have not less than 
two quarts of hot fat, have it hotter than for almost any other dish. Do 
not attempt to fry too many at a time, as they cool the fat and the chips 
are greasy and lack crispness. A granite kettlo is belter tlian a frying 
pan, as in order to keep the fat of an even temperature, it will be neces- 
sary to move it from time to time. Allow the chips to fry six minutes 
after the "boiling up" has stopped, which always takes place when the 
Potatoes are first put in. They should be crisp and a deep yellowish white, 
but not brown. Drain them on brown paper, dredge over with salt, and 
serve immediately in a hot, uncovered dish. — Selected. 

A Sure Vine Bug Remedy 

This is a sure vine bug remedy for the various insects that trouble

Mayonnaise Dressing

to use, take the required amount and thin with cream. 

— Mrs. Harry Crow, Richmond, Ind.

Macaroni and Cheese

layer of macaroni, one of cheese, let the top layer be cheese, pour over this 
a cupful of cream, bake a light brown. — Alice Wright. 

A Substitute for Lard 

Buy the fat of beef known as cod fat. This is the fat of the flank. 
Do not buy the kidney fat as that is very hard. Cut the fat in slices three- 
fourths of an incli thick, place in cold water for several hours to withdraw 
the blood then place in a covered pot or skillet over a medium Are, turning 
the pieces occasionally. When most of the fat is withdrawn pour into a 
vessel to cool, pressing the pieces with a fork or spoon to extract all the 
remaining fat. If the fat is well extracted the "cracklings'' may be thrown 
away but if not they may be saved for greasing the griddle. If properly 
cared for this fat will be as soft and white as lard and may be used in the 
same way. Pie crust made from this is far sweeter and better than from 
any other fat. The writer has used this for twenty years.

finely chopped parsley over and serve on a bed of lettuce leaves.

A New Sandwich 

One-half cupful scalded milk, one-half cupful of boiling water, one- 
half tablespoonful of lard, one-half tablespoonful of butter, two table- 
spoonfuls of molasses, three-fourths of a teaspoonful of salt, one half a 
yeast cake dissolved in two tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water, one- half 
cupful of white flour and enough entire wheat flour to kne£.d, and one cup- 
ful of English walnut or pecan nut meats broken in pieces. The result is 
more satisfactory if the nut meats are added while kneading after the flrst 
raising. When this bread is twenty- four hours old, slice as thin as possi- 
ble, spread sparingly and evenly with creaoied butter, and put orange 
marmalade between slices. Remove crusts, cut in triangles or any desired 
shapes, and garnish with halves of nut meats, which need a bit of butter on 
their under surfaces, to keep them in place To keep moist, pack the 
same as other sandwiches. If orange marmalade is not {)rocurable, make 
the sandwiches without it, and even then you will have a delicious novelt}'.

bear hands in it, work out in balls, and have ready one-quarter cup of 
butter in the skillet boiling hot. Put in the dressing and fry brown on 
both sides, then sprinkle flour in the butter while the dressing still remaius 
in the skillet and pour in chicken broth till enough gravy is made to 
cover the dressing. Use salt and pepper to taste. This is much better 
thau baking the dressing iu the chicken, as it dries out in the baking. The 
fowl is placed in the platter and the dressing put around it.

Cake Baking . 

When baking a delicate white cake, set a vessel of watei' in the oven, 
it will keep it from browning too brov^n. 

Tar, or Buggy Grease 

To remove, rub well with lard then wash out with soap suds. 

White Furs, White Shawls, etc. 

Cover with corn meal, let stand for four or five days, shake out, hang 
in the wind, they will look like new. 

Croup 
Cover the throat and chest well with a cloth wrung out of cold water, 
then wrap the child in a blanket and keep warm, relief will come in a few 
minutes. Powdered alum, one fourth teaspoonful in white of egg is very 
good as it will cause the phlegm to be thrown up. 

Iron Rust 

Get one-half ounce of oxalic acid in small pieces, in vial and keep 
corked, when needed dissolve one-half teaspoonful with two or three table- 
spoonfuls of boiling water, and dip the spot into it or wet with rag; as soon 
as the rust is bleached out, wash the article right out in clean water to keep 
acid from injuring the goods. Applications of lemon juice and salt is 
good, laying the goods out in the sun, or holding over the spout of a boil- 
ing tea-kettle 

Mildew, to Remove

When Freezing Ice Cream 

Pack and fill the freezer with fine ice and sail, then pour in cold water 
until it runs out at the drain in tne side of the freezer. Turn the crank of 
the freezer rapidly, but not too fast, and in five minutes or less the cream 
will be frozen and of a fine grain. — L. ]j. L. 

To Peel Oranges 

If you will pour scalding water over oranges and let them stand five 
minutes you will save time in peeling them. The thick white inner skin, 
usually so hard to get off, will adhere to the peel and come off with it, 
leaving the fruit beautifully clean and ready to slice. 

To Remove Ink from Wash Goods 

Melt a piece of tallow, and plunge the ink spot in the hot fat, then 
wash the article, and all traces of the ink will be gone. If the article be 
colored or will not wash, drop melted wax on the spot, let it uarden, then 
remove with a knife. The ink will be soaked up by the wax. If a shadow 
of wax or stain remains, put a piece of blotting paper over the place and 
press with a hot iron. — Mrs. H. H. 

Cough Syrup 

Juice of six lemons, one pound of strained honey, one ounce glycerine, 
one quart whiskey, mix, bottle, and take one tablespoonful three times a 
day. — S. P. Ledgerwood. 

Kerosene for Burns 

Few people seem to know the value of kerosene for burns. If possi- 
ble, immerse the burned part in kerosene for ten or fifteen minutes; if not, 
cover it closely for some time with a cotton cloth saturated with kerosene, 
and you will be surprised how soon the soreness will leave, never to return. 

--M. S. Van P. 

To Clean Tan Shoes 

A piece of lemon rubbed briskly on tan or brown shoes will effectually 
remove all dark stains, such as those from coal, soot, etc. After cleaning, 
wipe the lemon off the shoes, let dry, and then polish with the usual 
polish. The bright, new appearance of the shoes is very gratifying. 

—Mrs. F. H. P. 



136 



Fruit Stains

from coloring. 

Ink Spots on Carpet or Clothing 

Wash as soon as possible in milk (sour milk is best) and rinse in clear 
water. 

Soot 

"If soot falls on the carpet lay a paper near it and fan the soot onto it, 
if the least particle remains cover with bran or meal and brush up, then 
rub with dry cloth. 

Washing Windows 

Use a lablespoonful of kerosene (instead of soap) to a gallon of water 
and see how the windows sparkle. 

To Clean Clothing 

To clean a skirt or pair of pants, pour one gallon of gasoline into a 
vessel and dip the garment up and down, examine and if needed rub the 
sailed places gently, hang up to the clothes line and let drip, do not wring, 
it will not injure or shrink the finest fabric or most dainty color, — do not 
attempt this work in the house as it is positively dangerous. 

Flavoring Strawberry Preserves 

When making strawberry preserves add a little pine-apple and it will 
give a delicious flavor. Squeeze the pine apple through a cloth. 

— Mrs. J. H. Painter. 

To Cut Bread or Cake 

When about to cut new bread or cake, heat the knife very hot; thi^ 
will prevett its crumbling.

Some Uses of Salt 

For removing egg stains from silver, salt applied with a soft cloth will 
act like magic. 

If salt is rubbed on fruit stains when they are fresh all trace of them 
will disappear in the washing. 

A pinch of salt added to the whites of eggs will cause them to whip in 
half the time usually required. 

A pinch of salt added to ground coffee just before the cooking ac- 
centuates the natural flavor of the berry and gives "body" to the drink. 

• Greens used for palads should be thoroughly rinsed in salt water to 
dislodge possible insects or their eggs too small to be seen by the naked 
eye when picking over the greens. 

Sprinkle salt over a dingy carpet before sweeping and the transforma- 
tion wrought will convince the most skeptical of the value of salt as a 
cleanser all along the line. 

Everybody Knows, or at least should know, that nothing is so effectual 
for putting out fire in a burning chimney? as salt. To kill weeds apply 
boiling hot salt water in liberal quantities. To remove grass from brick 
walks spriukle freely with salt and let stand several days. 

Renovating Soap 

Good for cleaning spots from clothing, grease from coat collars, etc. 
Ivory soap one fourth pound, alcohol one ounce, beef gall two ounces, salt- 
peter one-fourth ounce, borax one-fourth ounce, sulphuric ether one-fourth 
ounce, spirits of turpentine one- fourth ounce, camphor gum three drams, 
pipe clay one dram, common salt one small te^spoonful. Mix the pipe 
clay into beefs gall, the camphor into the alcohol, pulverize, saltpeter and 
borax, after two or three hours, slice the soap into a porcelain kettle, with 
the gall mixture and place over a slow fire, stirring until melted, remove 
from fire, add all the other ingredients, stir until mixed, put into a glass 
fruit jar, as it soon hardens, keep lid screwed on tight as it loses strength 
by evaporation; keep in a dark closet as light injures it. To use, take out 
a tablespoonful, dissolve it in a quart of boiling water, use as hot as pos- 
sible by dipping an old brush or cloth in the hot liquid and rubbing the 
soiled spots, dry quickly.

sugar and take some occasionally. 

The juice of half a lemon in a cup of black coffee, without sugar, will 
cure sick headache. 

Lemon juice added to fruit juices that do not jell readily, such as 
cherry, strawberries, etc., will cause them to jell. 

Xo relieve rheumatism, add lemon juice to milk until it curds; then 
bind these curds upon the swollen parts. 

Lemon Extract — Let stand the rind of four grated lemons in half a 
pint of alcohol for about three weeks. Drain off the fluid, bottle and cork, 
and you have a finer extract tkan you can buy at the stores. 

Things to Remember. 

To prevent salt from becoming damp or hardening in the shaker place 
a few grains of rice in shaker when filling. 

In flavoring puddings, if the milk is rich, lemon flavoring is good; 
but if the milk is poor, vanilla makes it richer. 

To keep the flies on the screen door from coming inside rub the door 
with kerosene; the flies do not like the odor. A cloth saturated with kero- 
sene in a room drives flies to the floor. 

Delicate blues and pinks can be laundered without fading, in the fol- 
lowing way: One teaspoontul of turpentine put into half a gallon of water. 
Wet the goods in this and hang in the shade to dry. 

An easy and convenient way to remove the silk from sweet corn is to 
use a small vegetable scrub-brush. 

If any member of the family is very sick at the stomach, beat up the 
white of an egg and let him swallow it. It acts like a charm. 

A very valuable remedy for cases of proud flesh, an obstinate out- 
growth of flesh from small sores, consists of alum. A lump of alum is 
placed upon a heated stove just hot enough to enable it to turn to dry 
powder. The powder placed on the affected part repeatedly and covered 



144 



with a bandage can be relied upon to effect a speedy and inexpensive cure. 
It has never failed to cure when even the services of a physician were 
vainly resorted to. — A. A. H. 

Rice has a finer flavor if washed in hot wa'oer instead of c^ld, before 
cooking. 

The smaller a roast of meat, the hotter should be the oven at first, that 
the least possible amount of its delicate juices may escape. 

Bread should never be covered with a cloth when taken from the oven, 
but laid on the side and allowed to become perfectly cold; then keep in a 
closely covered tin box, without any wrappings. 

A spoonful of vinegar put into the water in which meats or fowls are 
boiled makes them tender. 

When corks swell and are two large for a bottle throw them for a fi-w 
minutes into a basin of boiling water. They will then soften. 

The best way to freshen home made bread so that it is as good as new 
is to dip the loaf in cold water, put it in a pan and bake it until it is heati'd 
through. Then wrap in a damp cloth, and when cold it is as good as when 
first baked. 

A good bath for tired, swollen feet is to bathe the feet in a bath with 
alum, one ounce; rock salt, two ounces; borax, two ounces; using one tea- 
spoonful to each quart of water. Bathe the feet in this water every niglit 
for a week. 

If grease is splashed on a stove, a little salt sprinkled on it prevents 
any unpleasant smell. 

A little vinegar kept boiling on the stove while onions or cabbage are 
being cooked will prevent the disagreeable odor going through the house, 
or a small pinch of carbonate of soda in the water preserves the color of 
vegetables and lessens the unpleasant odor of cabbage and onions when 
cooking 



Hy 



How to Cook a Husband 



A good many husbands are utterly spoiled in the cooking. Some 
women set them constantly in hot water; others let them freeze by careless- 
ness anil indifference. Some keep them in a pickle all their lives. It is 
not reasonable to suppose that any husband can be tender and appetizing 
treated in this way, but they are really delicious when properly prepared. 
In selecting your husband vou should not be guided by the silvery appear- 
ance, as in buying mackerel, nor by the golden tint, as in picking salmon. 
Be sure to select him yourself, as tastes differ. Do not go to market for 
him. The best are always brought to your door. But it is far better to 
have none unless you will patiently learn how to cook him. 

A preserving kettle of tbe finest porcelain is best; but if you have 
nothing but an earthen pipkin, it will do, with care. See that the linen in 
which you wrap him is nicely washed and mended, with the required 
number of buttons and strings securely sew£d on. Tie him in the kettle 
by a strong comfort cord. The duty cord is breakable and apt to let him 
fly out of the kettle and become burnt and crusty on the edge. Of course 
you know that, like a crab or lobster, you have to cook him alive. Set 
him near a clear, steady fire of love, neatness and cheerfulness. If he 
sputters and fizzles, do not be anxious. Some do this until they are quite 
done. Add a little sugar in the form of what confectioners call kisses, but 
no vinegar or popper in any account A little spice will improve him, but 
it must be used with judgment. Do not stick any sharp instruments into 
him to see if he is becoming tender. Stir gently, watching the while lest 
he lie too flat. and too close to the kettle, and so become flabby. 

If thus treated you will find him digestible, agreeing nicely with you 
and the children. He will keep as long as you like, unless you become 
careless and set him in too cold a place.
