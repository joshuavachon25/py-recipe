Chafing 





iga - 





HOW TO USE THE CHAFING DISH 

A chafing dish ought to be of extra heavy tin or some 
other metal tinned or nickel-plated. A large-flame 
alcohol-lamp should be underneath so as to have a good 
heat if needed, or a smaller lamp only to be used if light 
heat is required. In cooking oysters or similar articles 
a brisk heat is necessary, for making rarebits less fire is 
used. The blazer with the water-pan underneath is 
more for the purpose of heating ready-made things or 
keeping them hot, and only good for preparing articles 
which require little cooking.

quarter of a pound of mustard, one teaspoonful of curry 
powder, and one-half teaspoonful of salt. Put in jars 
and cork well. 



HOME - MADE FRENCH MUSTARD ^ 

Take three table-spoonfuls of mustard, three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, and mix thoroughly together. Beat

LOUIS' SALADS 

one egg very light and add to the above, mixing until 
smooth. Add one cup of white wine or cider vinegar 
(not strong), pour in slowly so as to keep smooth. Boil 
for four or five minutes. Add one table-spoonful of 
butter when ready to take from fire. Stir while cooking. 

ENGLISH MUSTARD <& 

Mix English mustard with bouillon or consomme until it 
gets smooth. White wine or cider vinegar can also be 
used instead of the bouillon. For all mixed mustards if 
they get dry put in a little beer or ale. This will bring the 
mustard back to its natural standard. For mixing, 
tarragon vinegar is much preferred. It helps to flavour 
the mustard. 



VINEGAR FOR HOME USE ^ 

Take one gallon white wine vinegar or cider vinegar, 
one-half gallon cheap red California wine, one bunch of 
tarragon, and one-half pint of stout or a glass of heavy 
ale. This should be kept in the kitchen. To make the 
vinegar settle quicker beat up one dozen eggs and put in 
the vinegar barrel. Never strain vinegar; let it settle 
itself and always keep the same barrel. The older the 
barrel hi which the vinegar is, the better your vinegar 
will be. Any kind of red wine mixed with any kind of 
vinegar will give a good body and keep for years. 



HOME - MADE FRENCH DRESSING ^ 

To make one quart take one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
half a teaspoonful of white pepper, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of paprika, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of 
English mustard, one-third of a quart of vinegar, shake 
well and make up the balance of the quart with olive-oil. 
This dressing well corked will keep for ever. Always 
shake bottle well before using. Two table-spoonfuls 
sufficient for one portion of salad. To find out if olive-oil 
is pure, dip a piece of white bread in the oil to be tested, 
in which way you can get the true taste of the olive-oil 

and tell whether it is blended with cottonseed oil or not.

LOUIS' SALADS 



BEACON OMELETTE 

Take equal amounts of peaches, pears, and pineapple and 
cut in small cubes, heat in a small saucepan with some 
guava jelly and a little Benedictine, and fill an omelette 
with this preparation. Turn it out on a platter, sprinkle 
thickly with powdered sugar, and burn it with a red-hot 
poker. Then pour some rum around it and set fire to it 
at the last moment before serving. 












HOW DIFFERENT SALADS ARE MADE 
AND SERVED 

First all materials should be secured fresh, they must 
be well cleansed, washed without handling, and all water 
removed as much as possible. The salad should be made 
immediately before the meal and be kept cool until 
wanted. Never place a salad in the ice-box where meat 
is kept. 

If no objection, a garlic flavour is healthy and improves 
all salads very much. A slight rubbing of the salad 
bowl with a clove of garlic or the crust of a small piece of 
bread rubbed with garlic and put in the salad bowl will 
improve the flavour of a moderate-sized salad. 

It is worth knowing that the odour of onion or garlic 
may be almost entirely removed from mouth and hands 
by eating celery tops or by rubbing your hands with the 
tops. 

Chopped fresh tarragon, chervils, or chives give a fine 
taste to all salads. 

The yolk of an egg will give a good body and improve 
all salads. To make a good dressing you must have good 
oil and vinegar. Olive-oil and red wine vinegar are pre- 
ferred. If you cannot get red wine vinegar you can add 
a wine-glass of red wine to a quart of dressing, which is 
made of white wine or cider vinegar. If you run short of 
oil use melted butter, cream or some gravy of sqme kind 
of roast meat, mix with the yolk of an egg. If you run 
short of vinegar the juice of two lemons to half a wine- 
glass of red wine will answer the purpose. If your oil 
gets cloudy or frozen, add a teaspoonf ul of salt to a quart 
and it will clear inside of twenty-four hours.

SANDWICHES 

To make sandwiches is a plain affair, but a good many 
do not know how to make them properly and attractively. 
If the bread is cut thin and of an equal thickness and 
properly buttered and the meat free from gristle and fat, 
and cut in nice thin slices, and furthermore, the whole 
sandwich carefully trimmed into a nice square shape and 
then cut diagonally, served on a plate covered with a nap- 
kin, it will always be appreciated. When, however, one 
gets two chunks of bread with thick pieces of meat be- 
tween, the butter unevenly spread on the bread, it will 
rapidly dimmish the appetite. 

Ham, tongue, roast beef, corned beef, lamb, chicken, 
veal and ham, and turkey sandwiches are all made in the 
same plain way, the bread and meat cut thinly and the 
butter softened so it will spread evenly over the bread. 
The fresh meat sandwiches are seasoned with salt. With 
ham, tongue and beef a little French or English mustard 
may be added according to taste. 



CLUB SANDWICH 

Toast two slices of bread and cover them thinly with 
mayonnaise dressing. Place two slices of chicken, white 
meat only, on one piece of toast. On top of this place 
one or two lettuce leaves and sprinkle some salt over it. 
Put the other piece of toast on top of this, and press the 
sandwich together a little and trim nicely, and cut the 
sandwich in two triangles. Serve warm if possible. 

Sometimes thin slices of broiled bacon, sliced tomatoes 
and even sliced pickles are added to the club sandwich. 
Bacon is acceptable, but if the two other articles are added 
the combination is superfluous. 



SARDINE SANDWICHES *

FOUR FAVOURITE DISHES 



CHICKEN EN CASSEROLE ^ 



Some cooks think that in making this dish if all kinds 
of vegetables are cooked with it, it will be an improvement, 
but in the end it is usually more like a vegetable stew 
than a chicken en casserole. 

To prepare it properly takes time; at least an hour or 
more for a medium-sized chicken. Take your chicken 
cleaned and dressed, and place in a casserole with a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, and roast it in the oven for 
about half an hour, then add one small onion cut thin, 
two slices of bacon, two fresh mushrooms and a little 
celery. Let cook together for about ten minutes in the 
casserole with the chicken. Then sprinkle half a tea- 
spoonful of flour over the whole, moistening with a cup- 
ful of brown gravy or rich stock and two table-spoonfuls 
of sherry. Season well. Put the cover on and let it sim- 
mer for half an hour or more. The chicken must be well 
cooked and the gravy boiled down so as to have just 
enough to go around for the two or three diners. Serve 
with a napkin placed around the casserole. 



(EUFS A LA NEIGE OR FLOATING ISLAND 

Take one quart of milk slightly sweetened and flavour 
with vanilla, put in a shallow pan and let come to a boil. 
Take the whites of six eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and add 
three ounces of powdered sugar, mixing carefully. Take 
this light meringue in heaping big spoonfuls, smoothing it 
on top so as to obtain the shape of a large egg and dip 
them in the boiling milk. Make about seven or eight of 
these egg-shaped masses. Let simmer for two or three 
minutes, then turn them over carefully and let them 
cook three minutes more. Remove them from the milk 
and put them on a napkin to drain and cool off. To the 
that is left add a little more sugar and the yolks of 

Si 




f \m 

I LOUIS' SALADS 

six eggs, making an ordinary custard. If you want it 
thicker add a little corn-starch. Strain the custard into 
a deep glass dish, and when cold put the snow eggs on top. 



OMELETTE SOUFFLE 

Take the yolks of four eggs, place in a bowl and add four 
heaping table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar and half a 
teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Beat together vigorously 
with a spoon or a small wire whisk for five or six minutes. 
Take the whites of seven or eight eggs, put in a bowl, and 
beat to a very stiff froth. Now mix the yolks and whites 
together very carefully, so that the beaten whites will not 
be worked up too much; that is, be sure the whites keep 
their firmness. Then pile the mixture on a slightly but- 
tered silver or metal dish, smooth it over with a knife so 
as to obtain a dome-shaped form, and bake in a very 
moderate oven for about twelve minutes or more and 
serve immediately. Any other flavour than vanilla can 
be substituted. Some fresh strawberries or similar fruit 
previously sugared can be put on the bottom of the dish. 
To make the omelette souffle a success two things have 
to be taken into consideration. First, that the whites of 
the eggs are beaten to a stiff froth, and second, that the 
mixing together of the whites and yolks of the eggs be 
done very carefully with a flat wooden spoon. 



MUSHROOMS UNDER GLASS COVER 

First procure a small round blazer and instead of a tin 
cover use a glass globe or cover for it. Second, butter 
your dish very well, put a large piece of toast in the dish, 
pile about twelve small peeled mushrooms on top of the 
toast, put on a piece of maitre d 'hotel butter the size of 
one-half an egg, sprinkle a little salt over it. Then add 
one-half a gill of cream, two table-spoonfuls of sherry 
wine. Put the cover on and let it simmer over a slow fire 
for about fifteen minutes' actual cooking. Should the 
cream boil down too quickly add a little more, but it is 

better not to lift up the cover until ready to serve, to 

82 







CHAFING DISHES 



preserve the flavour of the mushrooms. (For maitre 
d 'hotel butter, take three table-spoonfuls of butter, three 
teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful finely 
chopped onion, and juice of half a lemon. Salt and pepper 
to taste, and mix well.) 




>^fr. 




on Carting 






HINTS ON CARVING 

Before I enter into details about carving meats, poultry, 
game, etc., I would like to say that a piece of meat com- 
ing " red hot " to the table from the oven is very difficult 
to carve, as the slices will shrink up, lose blood, and not 
appear very attractive. A piece of beef, ribs, loin, etc., or 
a saddle or leg of mutton, etc., should have a chance to 
rest on a warm place for about ten minutes or more be- 
fore carving so that the meat can " settle down " as I 
may call it, and then it can be carved much better. All 
kinds of poultry before roasting or boiling should be tied 
up with a string in such a way that the breast of the fowl 
sticks out well above the legs, this is a great advan- 
tage to the carver. A piece of beef like ribs of beef should 
be properly trimmed of gristle, fat and bones before send- 
ing it to the dining-room. Concerning mutton, all the 
red skin on the leg or loin should be removed before 
roasting, otherwise when cooked it is so crisp that no 
knife can pass through it easily. 



ROAST CHICKEN 

To carve a roast chicken, remove the two legs, make 
a cut between the leg and breast, stick the fork in the 
thick part of the leg and lift it up from the carcass, cut 
through the joint between the drumstick and second 
joint and cut the second joint lengthwise in two. Cut the 
breast in four pieces, first take the two wings nearly the 
entire length of the breast and cut the centre of the 
breast lengthwise in two, following the breast-bone with 
the knife. Smaller pieces on the carcass like the oysters 
and wing-bone piece can be taken off easily. 




ROAST TURKEY &s 

To carve a turkey take the legs off first, carve them in 
pieces, especially the second joint. The drumstick is gen- 
erally full of sinews, but they can be removed before 

87 - 











LOUIS* SALADS 

roasting. Then start to carve the breast in large thin 
slices, starting at the wing and going up the breast until 
the breast-bone is reached. 

ROAST GOOSE ^ 



To carve a goose first remove the legs, then the wish- 
bone, cut down to the carcass on each side of the breast- 
bone, then start to slice off the breast. Unlike carving a 
chicken, start right on the top of the breast from the 
right to the left, slanting down to the wing. This will give 
you large thin slices ; cut the legs the same way as with a 
turkey. 



WILD DUCK ^ 

To carve a wild duck usually the breast only is used, the 
legs are generally too tough. Cut along the breast-bone 
right down to the joint of the wing, lift off the whole 
breast on one side, then on the other. If the duck is of 
good size cut the breast afterward in two pieces length- 
wise or even three slices if small portions are sufficient. 
Press the carcass and legs to get the blood out, and pour 
over the breast. 



SADDLE OF MUTTON OR LAMB 

There are two ways to carve a saddle, crosswise like 
chops, or lengthwise, the latter is the best but more ex- 
travagant. First cut the saddle into two parts, then cut 
down the back-bone, following the bone with the knife so 
as to lift up the meat of a quarter of a saddle in one chunk, 
then cut this chunk in four or five long slices. That 
means about sixteen to twenty slices from one saddle. 

LEG OF LAMB OR MUTTON^ 

The aitchbone, which comes at the steak or large end 
of the leg, should be removed before the lamb or mutton 
is cooked, and it is a good plan if this is done to bind the 
leg with a string. There are two ways in carving, the 

88 








CHAFING DISHES 



first giving better slices, while the second is more econom- 
ical. Start at the steak end and cut straight down against 
the grain until the bone is reached. Cut as many slices as 
needed and then pass the knife along the bone, relieving 
the slices from the meat on the other side of the bone. 
This way will give good regular pieces of meat. For the 
more economical way, carve the whole leg at once, start- 
ing at the small or shin end, cutting straight down across 
the gram to the bone. When the whole side is cut in 
slices, pass the knife along the bone, removing the pieces. 
Turn the leg over and carve the other side in the same 
manner. 




HAM 

Do not remove the bone before cooking, as with the leg 
of mutton. When well cooked, the ham will loosen itself 
and can easily be removed. In carving, proceed in the 
same manner as with the leg of lamb or mutton.

HOW TO MAKE A BILL OF FARE OR 

MENU I 

Menus fall in three different classes, - - the first for 
young ladies, second for ladies and gentlemen, and third 
for gentlemen or gourmets. All are practically governed 
by the same rule. You must see that the meats, and so 
forth, vary, light and dark meats, and that the sauces 
are of different colours and taste, that you have not two 
or three fried courses in the same dinner, and the same 
refers to sauces " brown " or " white." Luncheon or 
dinner for young folks (ladies especially) should consist 
of light, delicate things attractive to the eye, but tasteful 
to the palate. For a mixed dinner of ladies and gentle- 
men some good " recherches " dishes ought to be selected, 
as these diners are more or less capable judges about good 
things, especially " entrees " hot or cold. For the third 
class, a gentlemen's dinner, good, substantial, but plain 
dishes ought to be selected to tickle the gourmand's 
palate. 

Cold, appetizing dishes of some kind, chaud-f roid or 
galantins, are welcome in summer, but not so much ap- 
preciated in cold weather. Fishes that are just in season 
ought always to be selected; the same thing is true of 
vegetables and game. Canned vegetables should be 
avoided as much as possible. Salads like cucumber and 
tomato should be served with the fish, green salads like 
lettuce, Romaine or escarole with small birds or chicken ; 
celery or fancy salads like Waldorf or similar combinations 
with wild ducks or game of any kind. One vegetable and 
some kind of potatoes are sufficient to be served with the 
grosse piece or joint. Hot cheese, like cheese croquettes, 
ramequins of cheese and croutons, served before the des- 
sert or ice-cream, are preferred hi dinners to cold cheese. 

Three menus to illustrate the different classes of lunches 
and dinners are given herewith.
