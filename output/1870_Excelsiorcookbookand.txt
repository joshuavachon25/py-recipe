PEEFAOE. 



Ijf presenting this Avork to the public, the author 
ventures to hope that she is offering a book which will 
meet the demands of housekeepers in any sphere of life, 
and which will furnish rules and directions for the pro- 
per management of household matters and the skillful 
discharge of domestic duties. The receipts here given 
have all been thoroughly tested by experienced house- 
keepers, and have only to be strictly followed to prove 
their superior excellence. Economy, which at all times 
and under all circumstances should be practiced, has 
not been forgotten; therefore, one of the most, common 
objections against cook books generally, namely, their 
extravagance, has been avoided. Beside rules for 
cooking:, the book contains directions for the treatment 
of various diseases ; also for making butter and cheese, 
soap-making, dyeing, and the toilet, which alone are 
worth four times the price of the book to every house- 
keeper. The result of twenty-five years' experience, 
and selections from the best and most approved au- 
thors, are humbly submitted to the public, and the 
writer feels confident that her work will be, what its 
name indicates, an " Excelsioe Cook Book.'- 



RULES FOR HOrSEKEEPERS. 



Oedee is said to be '■ Heaven's first law ;" at any 
rate, it should be the first of every household ; and to 
maintain it, rules and regulations fior the management 
of domestic affairs should be framed, and their observ- 
ance strictly and punctually enforced upon each member 
of the family. It is just as easy to cultivate habits of 
neatness and order as those of an opposite character, 
and when once established, will contribute much to 
the happiness and comfort of their possessor. There 
should be regular hours for rising and retiring ; persons 
in health do not usually require more than seven or 
eight hours' sleep, but in sickness or debihty " kind na- 
ture's sweet restorer," is often the most efl&cient physi- 
cian, and should be welcomed as long as he chooses to 
bless with his presence. 

All important matters should be attended to in the 
early j)art of the day. If you have unpleasant duties to 
discharge, set about them resolutely and promptly, and 
not render their performance more difficult by procrasti- 
natins:. Alwavs have some convenient work at hand 
upon which to employ your leisure moments. By a 
judicious management of your affaii's, you will have 
time for making and receiving calls, time for reading, 
time for evenmsr and momins; communion with vour 
Maker — time for every thing. "When the hands are 
occupied, the mind can be employed in recalling and 
meditating on something you have been reading. Have 
a place for every thing and put every thiug in its place. 
Have a time to do each kind of work, and see that it is 
done at that tune. Study to do every thing in the best 
possible manner. 



8 RULES FOR HOUSEKEEPERS. 

Every house should have a dry, cool, store-room, con- 
venient to the kitchen. 

Have a box for every kind of spice, and have them 
Libeled. 

Put dried herbs in paper bags, and hang in a dry 
place. 

Dried fruit should be tied in cloth bags, and hung up. 

Vegetables should be put in sand in the cellar for 
winter use ; those not wanted till spring, buried in the 
ground. 

Flour should be kept in a barrel or bin, with a scoop 
to dip it with, kept covered, and always sifted before 
using, both for lightness of the food and cleanliness. 

Indian meal should be sifted and put in a barrel 
where it will keep cool and dry, occasionally stirring it, 
particularly in warm weather, as it is liable to get musty 
or sour. 

Rice should be kept in a dry tub, and when used, 
picked over and washed before using. 

Hominy should be washed in several ^s'aters to get 
out the hulls. 

Sugar should be bought by the barrel, as it is more 
economical than buying in small quantities. It can 
generally be purchased lower by the barrel, and is more 
convenient. 

It is a good plan to purchase molasses when you can 
get part of a hogshead, then draw off the molasses and 
put in a firkin or demijohn for use. The sugar at the 
bottom can be used for some kind of preserves or 
pickling. 

Coffee should be bought in quantities, as it improves 
by age. 

Tea is cheaper to buy by the box, but should be 
well covered ; if bought in small quantities, put it in 
a tin can. 

Raisins and starch are cheapest bought by the box. 

Zante currants should be washed and dried, then put 
in a jar for use. 

Lemon and orange-peel should be dried and pounded, 
put in glass bottles, well corked, for use. 

Nutmegs should be put in a box with the grater j 



KULES FOR HOUSEKEEPERS. 

ciiinaiiion, cloves, allspice, mace, and pepper should be 
bought whole, then ground fine and put in boxes for 
use. Mustard should be ground and kept tight. 

Sweet herbs sliould be gathered on a dry day, spread 
until dr}^, then put in paper bags. It is Avell to grind 
some and put in bottles for use. 

Hops sliould be kept in paper bags and hung up ; 
they are not good after a year old. 

Codfish should be purchased in small quantities, as it 
is unpleasant about the house. If put in a dry place it 
will get too dry, if too damp it will spoil ; it must be 
changed from garret to cellar. 

Cream of tartar, tartaric acid, essences, and sal vola- 
tile should be kejDt in glass bottles, particularly the sal 
volatile, which should have a ground stopper. Use 
cold water for dissolving^ it when used. 

Keep cheese in a dry, cool place, and after it is cut, 
wrap a cloth around and put in a tin box. If it gets 
dry before using, grate it and pour on brandy, then 
pack tight in a jar, and it will be better than at first. 

Butter should be kept in dry, cool cellars in the sum- 
mer, and in the winter in an outhouse or out-doors. 

Smoked beef should be kept in a bag and hung uj). 
While using ham, put in a bag and hang up. 

Keep bread and cake in a tin box, well covered ; it 
will keep fresh longer than any other way. 

Preserves and jellies should be put in glass, stone, 
or china, and kept "in a cool place. Jellies should be 
put in moulds or tumblers. Strawberries, pine-apples, 
and all delicate preserves may be kept in a box, with 
sand or saw-dust filled around them, and they will keep 
longer. 

All salted provisions should be watched, and see that 
they are kept under the brine, for if one piece of meat 
lies up it will spoil the whole barrel. If the brine 
looks bloody, it must be scalded, and more salt added ; 
when cold pour back. 

Tallow should be kept in a dry, cool place. All kinds 
of oil in the cellar. Salt should be kept in the dryest 
place that can be found. 

No housekeeper should be without good vinegar; 



]0 EULES FOR HOUSEKEEPERS. 

the best is made from cider or wine. The washings 
from honey, (and after making jelly or wine,) should be 
poured into the vinegar. Cold tea should be saved for 
this purpose. 

Jelly-bags should be made of flannel, pudding-bags 
of coarse, thick cotton cloth. 

Pickles should be kept in a cool place, and often look- 
ed to ; if the vinegar is too strong, they will get soft. 
A cloth should be put on top, and washed out as the 
scum rises. Put mustard, nasturtions, or horse-radish 
to keep them. Alum will harden them. 

Wheat-starch is made by washing the wheat clean, 
then mash it fine, wash and strain, and the starch will 
settle at the bottom. 

Potato-starch is made by grating the potatoes, then 
washing clean and straining. They should be pared 
first. Corn-starch is made in the same way. 

Wheat washed and boiled as rice, and eaten with 
cream, sugar, and nutmeg, is nice, and a very good sub- 
stitute for that article. 

Poppy-leaves and rose-leaves should be gathered, and 
dried on paper, then put in paper-bags for poultices and 
washes. 

Iron ware lined with enamel is sujjerior to CA^ery 
other utensil, for preserving, and should always be used; 
but if brass or copper is used, it should be kept scrupu- 
lously clean. 

To purify water, put common charcoal in a watering- 
pot, and fine sand over it. Let the water trickle 
through. An old sieve will answer. 

Save all your suds for gardens. It is a great fertilizer 
for grape-vines. 

German silver spoons should never be used ; iron 
ones are preferable. 

Marble fire-places nor oil-cloths should not be wash- 
ed in suds. Wipe ofi* the dust, then rub with a cloth 
dipped in oil. Buttermilk is good to wash oil-cloths. 

To make flat-irons smooth, rub a little bees-wax over 
them, then rub Avith a cloth. 

Count all your clothes-pins, spoons, knives and forks, 
towels, napkins, etc., once a week. 



HULES FOR HOUSEKEEPERS. 11 

' A little bees-wax or soap rubbed on the hinges of 
your doors to prevent their creaking, and on drawers, 
to make them run easy, is good. 

Never put away your clothes or stockings without 
mending. A basket should be kept, and when the iron- 
ing is done for the week, any article that wants repair- 
ing should be put into it. 

To keep hams : Wrap them in brown paper and pack 
loosely in barrels of dry ashes or oats set in a dry place, 
or rub them over witli black pepper mixed with Cayenne, 
then put in bags and keep in a cool place. Another : 
smoke a barrel, set it in the attic, have nails driven 
around, and hang the hams in, then cover with a thick 
cloth, and a board on top. Another : put in bags and 
whitewash them ; hang in a cool place. A very suc- 
cessful way of keeping them is to cut the ham in slices 
and pack them in a jar ; melt lard and pour over ; cover 
tight and keep in a cool place. 

Soft soap should be kept in an out-house, and not used 
until six months old. 

Onions should be tied in linen bags, and hung in a 
dry, cool place. 

Eggs should be kept in lime-water or salt, w^ith the 
small end down. 

Use w^hiting or chalk to clean silver ; if very black, 
wet with alcohol ; rub with soft flannel or buckskin. 

To bleach cotton cloth : Soak in cold water till wet 
through, then put in chloride of lime, say a pound to 
forty yards of cloth, with just sufficient water to cover 
it. Let it remain from three to five hours, then rinse 
well and dry. 

Salt or brine is good to put on sidewalks or places 
where the grass is not wanted. 

All herbs should be gathered on a dry day, and while 
in blossom. 

Smart-weed is an excellent weed for many purposes, 
and should always be gathered. 

Horse-radish leaves and burdock leaves should be 
dried for use. 

Lettuce and motherwort are quieting to the nerves. 



12 IIULES FOR HOUSEKEEPERS. 

Boneset or thoroughwort is good for coughs, colds, 
liver complaint, and stomach derangement. 

Spearmint is good to settle the stomach, and for bowel 
complaints. 

Catmint and elderblows should always be gathered. 
Mayweed is good for many things. 

Grapes should be packed in sawdust or dry sand to 
keep any time. 

Apples keep better by wrapping them in papers, and 
keeping them in a cool place. This is some trouble, 
but large ones can be taken care of in this way. Dry 
sand and buckwheat chaff is good to pack them in, then 
put in a cool place. 

Lima beans should be dried for winter's use, or they 
be packed in salt. Take them in the pods, just as they 
begin to turn yellow, and pack in a keg, with alternate 
layers of salt. Soak in cold water over night before 
using. 

Tea and coffee should be made as soon as the water 
boils, or the gas escapes and the flavor is destroyed. 

Molasses is improved by boiling, and should be boiled 
and set away for cake and other purposes. 

Cranberries should have water kept on them, and 
changed every two weeks. 

Scour zinc with sand and buttermilk. 

Pour hot tallow on ink-spots, let it remain a few min- 
utes before washing. 

To give a gloss to shirt-bosoms and collars, add a 
piece of white wax and spermaceti, each about the size 
of a pea, to a pint of starch, while boiling. Iron until 
smooth, as friction puts on the gloss. 

Another : pour boiling water on gum arable, and 
when dissolved, put in a bottle, cork tight. When the 
starch is boiled add some, and it will give a fine gloss. 

To choose nutmegs, prick them with a pin ; if the oil 
comes out, they are good. 

Keep lemons and oranges well wrapped in paper, and 
they will keep a long time. 

To use cold starch, pour cold water on the quantity 
of starch required, stir well, then dip in the articles to

be starched ; roll them up in a dry cloth ; iron m fifteen 
minutes. 

To prepare rye for coftee : wash thoroughly, and 
soak OA'er night. Brown the color of coflee in the 
morning. 

Celery should be put in the cellar, in a box of dry 
sand, for winter use.

In selecting beef, the best pieces are cut from the shoulder 
to the rump, including the sirloin, the first, second, and third 
cuts of the fore-quarter. Steaks from the round are larger, 
but tougher and not as sweet as from the sirloin. The pieces 
near the fore-shoulder are always tough. 

COOKITTG THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF BEEF. 

The head and heart are used for mince pies ; also the neck. 
The tongue for smoking, or corned and boiled. The sirloins 
roasted, or steaks. The round or buttock is used for steak, 
corning, and cooked a la mode, or dried beef. Edge-bone, 
boiled. Flanks, steaks or corned. Hock or shin is used for 
soups. Tallow tried for candles. Some of the suet should be 
taken care of for pies, puddings, etc. The neck may be used 
for soup. 

VEAL. 

The loin is used for roasting. The knuckles are used for 
broths and soups. The neck is used for soups, stews and pot- 
pies. The fillet is used for cutlets, or to stuff and roast. 

MUTTOIsT. 

The loin is roasted. The leg is roasted, or corned and 
boiled, or cutlets made out of it. Neck or back, boil, roast, 
haricot, stewed, or soup. Shoulder, roast. Breast, grilled. 
Head, soup. 

PORK. 

Shoulder and ham are used for smoking. The spare-rib is 
used for roasting, ribs included. The lean pieces used for 
sausages, and the tenderloins for broiling. The head and 
feet for head-cheese, souse or scrapel ; or the feet may be used 
for jelly. The rest may be corned. 



EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK. 



A SOUTHERN MODE OF CUEING HAMS. 

Take four quarts of salt, one and a half ounces of salt- 
petre, with sufficient molasses to make a paste ; this 
quantity will salt a hundred and fifty pounds of meat. 
Kub well on the fleshy side ; let it remain four weeks, 
then smoke. Two days before removing from the 
smoke-house, rub them over with black pepper and 
strong vinegar, to prevent the flies from touching them, 
then put in bags and hang up. 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

Take one and three quarters of a pound of good salt, 
half an ounce of saltpetre, one pint of molasses, one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus, add one gallon of water. Bring 
the liquor to a boil, taking care to skim well. When 
cool, pour over the meat. Keep well covered with 
brine. After remaining six weeks, smoke them. 
• 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

Take one pound of salt, one ounce of saltpetre, one 
pint of molasses, to twenty pounds of ham ; water sufii- 
cient to cover well, then boil and skim as above. 

CUBIWa MUTTON HAM. 

Cut a hind-quarter of mutton into the shape of a ham, 
then pound one ounce of saltpetre with one pound of 
salt and a quarter of a pound of brown sugar ; rub the 
ham well with this mixture, particularly the hole of the 
shank ; let it lie a fortnight, rubbing it every two or 
three days, then press it one day with a weight. Smoke 



16 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

it with sawdust ten clays, or hang it to dry in the 
kitchen. 

CUBING HAMS. NO. 4. 

To one hundred pounds of meat, take four pounds of 
fine salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and four ounces of 
brown sugar ; mix well together, and rub the hams 
until they are covered ; then lay them on a board and 
repeat the rubbing daily for several weeks, or till the 
meat is ready for smoking. 

TO PICKLE BEEF. 

Take four gallons of water, one pound of brown 
sugar, eight of salt, four ounces of saltpetre. Boil to- 
gether, and carefully take off the scum as it rises. 
When clear, let it remain till cool, then pour over the 
meat. Increase the quantity according to the quantity 
of meat. 

A PICKLE FOR BEEF TON"GUES OR DRIED BEEF. 

Take a pound and a half of brown sugar, six pounds 
of beef, ounce of saltpetre or saleratus, and four gal- 
lons of water, boil gently, skim well, and when clear, 
set away to cool. Put the meat in a tub, and j^our on 
till covered ; a weight should be put on to keep it under 
the brine. 

TO PICKLE PORK. 

It should not be salted until the meat is perfectly cold. 
It is best to let it remain one day before packing. 
Sprinkle salt on the bottom of a clean, sweet barrel ; 
rock-salt is the best for this purpose. Put in a layer of 
poi'k with the rind down, pack closely, then a layer of 
salt alternately till all is in. Make a strong brine, boil, 
skim, and when cold, pour. Keep a stone on top to 
keep the meat under. If there is not sufficient salt, it 
will not keep during the warm weather ; in that case, 
it must be scalded over, adding more salt. It should 
be looked to from time to time, to see that it is well 
covered with brine, for, if not, the top pieces become 
tainted, and will extend to the whole barrel. In salting 
down new pork the old brine may be used, by scalding 
and skimming. 



AND UOUSEKEEPER's AID. 17 

DIRECTIONS FOR CUTTINa UP A HOG. 

Take off" the head, split the hog tlirough the spine ; 
take out the leaf-fat, then take oiF a piece of the shoulder 
for sausage-meat ; the lean meat called spare-rib should 
not be taken off. Cut a narrow strip from the belly for 
sausage-meat. Take off the ham and shoidder for smok- 
ing, the remainder for salting ; the cheek may be used 
for sausages. 

TRYING LARD. 

Cut up the leaf-fat, take off the skin, put over a gen- 
tle fire, stirring occasionally to prevent its sticking at 
the bottom. 'No water should be added, as it will make 
it sputter, and will not keep so well. When a nice 
brown, strain through a strainer, using a pair of squeez- 
ers. Care should be taken not to let it burn. 

The fat taken off the intestines should be soaked in 
salt and water two days, changing each day. This fat 
should be used first, as it will not keep as long as the 
leaf-fat. 

TO PREPARE CASES FOR SAUSAGES. 

Empty the cases, the smaller mtestines of the hog ; 
wash well ; cut in lengths of two yards ; scrape, and 
turn with a stick each day for five days, soaking in salt 
and water, changing each time. 

TRYING TALLOTV. 

Cut in small pieces, put over a slow fire without any 
water, frequently stirring. When brown, squeeze 
through a strainer. 

ON CARVING. 

Your knife must not be too heavy, nor too large, 
but of middling size, and of a fine edge. Less strength 
is required than practice. The dish should be suffi- 
ciently near to enable the carver to reach it without 
rising, and to give an appearance of ease and ability. 
Cut Vour pieces, asking him or her what part they 
prefer, and showing no partiality to your guests. Fish 
requires but very little carving. It shoulcl be carefully 
helped with a fish-knife, which is not sharp, and being 



16 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

broad, it prevents the flakes from being broken, and, 
in salmon and cod, adds much to their beanty. A jDor- 
tion of the roe should be given to each person, as well 
as liver. 

In salmon, the choice parts are next the head, and 
the thin part towards the tail is less savory. This is 
seldom sent to the table whole. A piece cut from 
the middle j^arts is the best flavored. Make an in- 
cision along the back ; then cut the thickest part for 
the lean, and the thin for the fat. A cod's head and 
shoulders, when in season, is a very genteel dish. 
All the parts are eaten, except the green jelly of the 
eye ; that is never served. The tongue and palate are 
considered great delicacies, for which you must insert 
a spoon into the mouth to obtain. Insert the knife 
from the back of the head, through the back; and 
help each person to a piece of the sounds, which line 
the under side of the backbone, together with a piece 
of the fish. Mackerel should have the head cut ofi", as 
being unsavory ; then divide down the back, and give 
a side to each, if small ; and, if less is required, give 
the thickest end. Give some of the roe, if liked. In 
the male it is hard ; in the female, soft. 

Turbot : The under part is most esteem.ed, and should 
be placed uppermost on the table. The middle is the 
choicest part, and an incision should be made directly 
through. It is difiicult to divide the backbone ; and 
it must be raised with the fork, until you separate a 
portion of it with the fish-knife. It is preferred by 
some, though less delicate than the under side. 

To carve a calf's head : Cut along the cheek-bone, and 
let the knife penetrate to the bone. The sweet-bread 
lies at the thick part of the neck, which should be cut 
in slices. If the eye is asked ibr, take it out with 
the point of a knife. The palate is esteemed a deli- 
cacy, and some nice lean pieces may be cut from under 
the jaw-bone. A tongue should be (ut through the 
thickest part, and slices cut from that, as it is more 
juicy. The fat is at the root of the tongue. 

To carve a pig : This is generally divided by the 
cook before sending to the table. First, separate the 



AND housekeeper's AID. 19 

shoulders from the body ; then the leg ; then divide the 
ribs into two or three parts. Put a piece of stuffing 
on each plate. Some prefer a bit of the ear. 

Spare-rib : Cut from the thick meat near the back- 
bone, slicing oif. If a rib is preferred, they are easily 
cut through, after the meat is taken off. 

A ham should be cut through the thick part, where 
the best j^ieces are; or you may commence at the 
knuckle, and proceed towards the end. 

Poultry : Put your fork into the middle of the fowl, 
or breast ; take off the wing and leg on both sides ; 
then cut slices from ~ each side of the breast. Ask 
which part each person prefers, and give a piece of 
dressing to every one. 

MEATS. 

In every branch of cookery experience is necessary, 
particularly in meats. Almost all kinds of meats are 
tenderer and better flavored by being a day or two 
old, in summer ; and in cold weather they require 
a longer time. Beef and mutton do not ripen so soon 
as veal or lamb. When frozen, it should be laid in a 
warm place to thaw, before using, or it will be dry, 
and will not cook well. It is not so sweet if put into 
cold water to take out the frost. It can be kept frozen, 
by packing in snow ; but as soon as the snow melts, it 
should be cooked. I have sometimes kept meat in the 
ice-house, but as soon as taken out it must be used ; it 
Avould not keep long. "Warm, damp weather is bad for 
keeping meats. South winds and lightning are very 
unfavorable. After a storm meat should always be 
examined. I have sometimes kept it successfully by 
putting in flour, in a dry place, as it keeps the flies 
from it, and also the air. Meat will keep longer by 
hanging than by laying down, if kept from the flies. 
If it does not smell perfectly sweet, add a little sale- 
ratus while boiling, and, if not bad, it will remove 
every unpleasant taste or smell. Fowls should never 
be cooked if there is the least taint about them. 

BOILIlXrG- MEATS. 

While boiling meat, care sliould be taken to keep 
it constantly boiling, and well skimmed. The scum 



20 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

should be taken off just before boiling ; and if not all 
takun off, throw in a little cold water, and skim again. 
Fresli meat should be put into hot water, salt into cold 
water. Never crowd the meat, but leave room for 
plenty of water. A quarter of an hour is allowed for 
a pound of meat. A chicken will cook in half an 
hour, or, if six months old, it will require an hour. 
An old fowl requires from four to five. Meats should 
be boiled gently, as fast boiling hardens meat. Tlie 
part that is to be uppermost on the table should be 
laid down in the pot, as the scum is apt to give it a 
dark look, if not all taken off. When half boiled, 
throw in salt — say a large spoonful to three quarts of 
water. The water can be used for soup ; if too 
greasy, skim off part of the fat. Meat or poultry lose 
their flavor by standing in water after they are done. 
The cover should never be taken off, except to take off 
the scum or examine the meat, and should be imme- 
diately put on again. When meat is put into cold 
water, it should be heated gradually ; for, if boiled too 
soon, it will shrink and harden, and will not throw up 
the scum so readily. 

ROAST OR BAKED MEATS. 

Meats are better roasted than baked ; but it is more 
convenient to bake, since fire-places have become obso- 
lete. It must be frequently basted, and baked slowly. 
Before putting in the oven, rub salt and pepj^er all over 
the meat, and put water in the dripping-pan, always 
adding more when required, occasionally turning the 
meat over, and basting often. When tender, take up, 
and stir in a little flour and water, having previously 
mixed it, so as to get out all the lumps. Lean meats 
require butter put into the gravy. Game and pork 
require sweet herbs. 

FRIED MEATS. 

Fried meat is the most convenient method of cook- 
ing, but not as digestible as other modes, and should 
be avoided as mucli as possible. In frying fresh pork, 
plenty of pepper and salt, also sweet herbs, should be 
sprinkled on, and it will fry itself Lean meats require 



AND housekeeper's AID. 21 

butter or lard put into the spider, previous to puttlniv 
in tlie meat. Pork is always ])rereral)le to lai-d, wliicJi 
can bo. fried first, then taken out, when the meat can 
be put in. It sliould fry quick, otherwise it will be 
liard and i^reasy. Take u)) the meat and stir in a 
spoonful of ilour; mix Avell, so it will not be lumpy; 
turn in a little hot water, stir up, and turn on the meat. 
It must be seasoned while cooking. 

BROILED MEATS. 

Broiling is considered by epicures to be decidedly 
the best mode of cooking meats, particularly beef and 
chickens. Meats should not be cooked on the same 
gridiron as iish, unless great care is used in cleaning — 
which should always be done in either case. It is 
well to have the bars of the gridiron concave and 
termitiate in a trough ; otherwise the juice will drop 
into the lire, and smoke the meat. If the meat is not 
fat, it is well to grease the bars before using, or tho 
meat will show the impression and injure the looks. 
The quicker meats are boiled w^ithout burning, the 
sweeter they will be. Have your platter warm; lay 
on your meat when done ; sprinkle salt, pepper, and 
melted butter ; turn over two or three times ; then 
send to the table hot. 

BROILINQ BEEF. 

Steaks from the round are generally used, but are 
not as good as the sirloin. Be carefid to have it cut 
the riglit way of the grain. It should be laid on « 
board and pounded, before broiling. Have nice hot 
coals, and the gridiron warm, before putting on ; broil 
quickly, without burning. When the juice begins to 
rise, take a knife and fork, having your phitter at 
hand; take it carefully up and lay on the platter; 
Avhen the juice has drained out, put back on the 
gridiron, the other side down ; let it remain a moment, 
when it must be turned again. This saves the juice, 
which otherwise goes into the lire. It should look red 
when done, and tlien it will be sweet and tender ; if 
done too much, it becomes hard and tough, without 



22 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

that sweet taste for which beef is noted. Season with 
melted butter, j^epper and salt. If liked, add a sj^oon- 
fiil of hot water. It should be eaten the moment it is 
cooked. It requires from ten to fifteen minutes in 
cooking. 

FKIED BEEF. 

The same pieces that are used for broiling are good 
fried. It should be fried in butter or beef drippings ; 
put in when hot, sprinkle a little salt and pepper over ; 
turn immediately or it Avill cook too much. When 
done, take up and stir in flour, then pour in hot water 
to make a gravy ; send to the table at once. 

KOAST OK BAKED BEEF. 

In selecting beef care should be taken to get that, 
that is tender, and of a bright red color, the fat white. 
The sirloin of the cuts from the fore-quarter are the 
best pieces for roasting or baking. Rub salt and pep 
per on the meat ; lay in the dripping-pan ; put in water, 
and baste frequently with a large spoon. Roast slow- 
ly at first, then increase the heat, turning the meat oc- 
casionally over, and adding more water if needed. Do 
not let the water get out. If thick, allow twenty min- 
utes to a pound ; if thin, less time will be required. 
Wlien done, make a gravy according to the directions 
given. 

FBICASSEED BEEF. 

Take any piece of beef — such as will not answer for 
any other purpose, will do ; put in water sufficient to 
cook it tender ; Avhen half done, throw in salt and some 
pep]:»er ; fry down to a nice brown ; then make a gravy 
of flour and water. Serve with apple-sauce, vegetables, 
and salad. 

MOCK DUCK. 

Take as large a slice of beef as you can get ; pound 
thin ; then make a stuffing prepared as for a turkey ; 
fill it, and sew np ; fry one hour in the drippings of 
beef or butter ; turn it and keep covered until done ; 
after taking up, pour in hot water, and the stuffing that 



AND housekeeper's AID. 23 

falls will thicken it. Yon must season it with salt and 
l^epper wlicn first put over. 

BEEF COOKED IN OlSTIONS. 

Fry a few slices of pork qnite brown, then take ten- 
der beef and slice thin ; put a layer of beef and pork 
with onions sliced; season with salt and pepper. Put 
on sufficient water to cover it, and, when done, take up ; 
then stir flour and water to make tlie gravy. They 
that are fond of onions will find this a savory dish. 

ALAMODE BEEP. 

Take five or six pounds of the round of beef; then 
soak one pound of bread in cold water ; drain off the 
Avater, (or only put enough on to soak the bread;) 
mix a large spoonful of flour, the same of melted butter, 
a teaspoonful of salt, two eggs, pepper, cloves and all- 
spice to the taste, or, if preferred, sweet herbs. Cut 
gaslies in the meat, and fill with part of the meat ; stew 
gently two hours, in just sufficient water to cover it ; 
then take up and put in a dripping-pan with the liquor ; 
lay the reserved dressing on top, and bake two hours, 
or until tender, basting occasionally. When taken up, 
make a gravy, as directed, and, if liked, add a wine- 
glass of wine, and a little butter. 

BOUILLI. 

Boil about seven or eight pounds of beef in more 
water than enough to cover it. Take oft" the scum as it 
rises ; then put in two carrots, two onions, two heads 
of celery, turnips, two cloves, a little parsley, and sweet 
herbs. Let it boil gently four or five hours. Put a 
turnip, an onion, and a head of celery to cook whole, 
and when done, take out and cut in squares. Take out 
the meat carefully, and skim off tlie fat, and lay the 
sliced vegetable in the soup, and add a spoonful of cat- 
sup, then serve as other soup. 

KOLLED BEEF. 

Take the inside of a sirloin ; soak in a glass of port 
wine and a glass of vinegar mixed for forty-eight hours ; 
make a stuffing, and fill it ; then bind up tight, and 



24 EXCELSIOE COOK BOOK 

roast before the fire, if convenient ; if to be cooked in 
the stove, put in a pan with a pint of water, and cook 
gently ; baste with a gLass of wine and vinegar together, 
also, a tea-spoonful of pounded allspice. Larding im- 
proves the look and flavor. Make a gravy, "and serve 
with currant-jelly or cranberries. 

BEEF CAKES. 

Pound some beef that is under-done with a little fat 
ham ; season with pepper and salt, also onions, (if you 
like ; ) mix well and make into cakes, and fry a nice 
brown. Serve them in a good gravy. 

A FRICAKTDEAU OP BEEF. 

Take a piece of lean beef, lard it with bacon seasoned 
with pepper and salt, cloves, mace, and allsjDice. Put 
in a kettle with a pint of broth, a glass of white wine, 
all sorts of sweet herbs, a garlic or onion, four cloves, 
pepper and salt. When the meat is tender, cover it 
close and skim the liquor ; then strain it, and let it 
boil till it is reduced to a glaze. Glaze the larded side 
with it. 

TO MAKE HUNTER'S BEEP. 

Take a round of beef that weighs twenty-five pounds, 
let it hang two days in summer, and longer in winter, 
then take one ounce of saltpetre, three ounces of brown 
sugar, an ounce of clove, and the same of nutmeg, half 
an ounce of allspice, three handful s of common salt, and 
rub well into the meat ; turn and rub every day for 
two or three Aveeks. The bone should be taken out 
first. When to be cooked, dip into cold water, to take 
oif the loose spice ; then bind with cord or tape, and 
put in a pan with a tea-cupful of water ; cover the top 
of the meat with shred suet, and cover the pan with 
brown crust and paper ; bake six hours ; when cold, 
take off the paste and tape. The gravy is nice ; it will 
keep a long time. 

ANOTHEU MODE OF DRESSING BEEF. 

Take the bones out of three ribs ; sprinkle with salt ; 
roll tiirht, and roast it. It looks nice. It can be dono 
as hunter's beef. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 25 

ITALIAN BEEFSTEAK. 

Cut a steak as for broiling ; pound well, and season 
with salt, pepper, and onion ; put in a stew-pan, cover 
tight, and set wliere it will cook slowly, and without 
burning. Cook two or three hours, and then make a 
gravy. 

BEEF OLIVES. 

Take beef half cooked, cut in slices half an inch thick, 
and four inches square ; lay then on a force-meat of 
bread-crumbs, a little suet, pepper and salt ; roll them, 
and fasten with skewers ; put in a stew-pan, with 
some gravy, and a sjDOonful of water, and stew until 
tender. 

TO DKESS THE SAME-SAN"I>EBS. 

Chop beef or mutton, with onion, pepper and salt ; 
add a little gravy ; put into saucers, making them two 
thirds full ; fill up with mashed potatoes ; put a piece 
of butter on the top, and brown in an oven. 

CECILS. 

Mince-meat of any kind, crumbs of bread, onion, an- 
chovies, lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, chopped parsley, pep- 
per, a piece of butter ; stir well together over a fire for 
a few minutes. When cool, make up into balls the size 
of a turkey's egg ; roll in eggs beaten light, then sprinkle 
with bread-crumbs ; then fry a nice brown, and serve 
with gravy. 

HASH BEEF. 

Chop up pieces of beef that has been cooked, with 
boiled potiatoes, half and half, put in a spider ; season 
with pepper and salt, also a piece of butter. Salt pork 
is nice for this purpose. 

BEEF CAKES. NO. 2» 

Chop pieces of roast beef very fine, mix bread-crumbs, 
chopped onions, and parsley ; season with pepper and 
salt; moisten with drippings or catsup; cold ham or 
tongue may be added ; make in broad flat cakes, and 
spread a coat of mashed potatoes on the top ; put a 
piece of butter on every cake, and set it in the oveu to 

2 



26 EXCELSIOE COOK BOOK 

brown. Other cold meats may be prepared in the same 
way. 

BEEF LIVER. NO. 1. 

Cut in thin slices and lay on a gridiron, with good 
live coals under ; when cooked on one side, turn over ; 
sprinkle a little salt and pepper over it, and in ten min- 
utes it will be done ; lay on melted butter, or make a 
gravy of flour and water. It is very nice fried. But 
the best way to use beef liver is to corn it, and then 
smoke it, as you would smoked beef; then cut in thin 
slices, and fry in a little butter ; it will not need much 
cookmg. This is very nice for tea. 

TO BOIL A TOWGUB. 

Put a tongue into a pot over night, with water on ; 
let it remain until next day, about three hours before 
dinner. 

FRIZZLED BEEP. 

Cut dried beef in thin slices, and warm, with a little 
water in the pan ; stir in a little flour and water mixed, 
a piece of butter, and take up, as much cooking hardens 
it ; add eggs, if liked. 

TRIPE. 

Very few persons nnderstand dressing tripe. It 
should be cut in squares, nearly a quarter of a yard 
long ; then scraped every day for nine days in succes- 
sion ; and j)nt in fresh water with salt thrown in. It 
should then be boiled in milk until tender ; if it can be 
kept frozen it is better ; if not, it must be kept in salt 
and water, and changed every day while it lasts. It 
can be pickled in spiced vinegar, or broiled like steak, 
or fried in butter, or a nice stuffing made and filled ; 
then sew up and fry. 

TO STE-W BEEP. 

Take a good piece of fresh beef, not too fat, boil un- 
til an hour before taking up, then season with pepper 
and salt ; pare potatoes and parsnips ; cut one in two ; 
cook until tender ; then make a gravy. If you have 
Bweet potatoes, they are better. . . 



AND housekeeper's AID. 27 

FBOZEW BEEF. 

If beef is frozen, shave off what you require with a 
sharp knife ; put in a spider with butter, a few onions 
or not, just as you like, cover close ; when nearly done, 
season with salt and pepper ; make a gravy as directed. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

Cut your veal, as for steaks ; that cut from the round 
is the best ; put some butter in the pan, and let it be 
hot ; beat up an egg, dip one piece of veal in at a time ; 
have some flour on another plate ; dip into the flour 
next, both sides, lay carefully into the pan, sprinkle 
salt and pepper over them. Another way is to fry the 
veal first, and then dip in the egg and flour, and fry 
gently five minutes. 

VEAL STEAV. 

Cut veal into strips or small pieces, a few slices of 
salt pork, potatoes pared and sliced thin ; put on water 
to cover the whole ; when nearly done, season with pep- 
per and salt. About five minutes before taking up lay 
on the top slices of bread, and cover again closely until 
the bread has steamed through ; then take up. 

A FILLET OP VEAL. 

Take out the bone and fill with a nice stuffing ;• close 
the meat up tight, season with salt and pepper, put in 
a dripping-pan with water, and bake two hours ; thick- 
en the gravy, adding butter, and if liked, a glass of 
wine. Yeal is very nice cut in gashes, and slices of 
pork laid in and cooked. The lorn is the best part for 
roasting. The neck is good for soup. The bones, after 
cutting off the meat, are nice for pot-pies. 

FOKCE-MEAT BALLS. 

Chop pieces of veal up fine, with a very little pork ; 
add a couple of eggs, and season to the taste ; do up into 
balls the size of an egg, and fry brown. 

CALF LIVER. 
It is good fried or broiled, stuffed and baked ; but 
the best way is Jo take the liver, heart, and nnder-jaw, 



28 IIXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

boil together until tender, then take out of the liquor 
and chop fine ; season with butter, pepper, and salt ; 
you may add sweet herbs if you like. 

COLLOPS. 

Cut veal into thin slices, dip into flour and fry brown ; 
then turn in water to cover the veal, and when it boils 
put in two or three sliced onions, pepper and salt ; when 
tender take up, thicken the gravy and squeeze in the 
juice of a lemon and turn on the coUops ; garnish the 
dish with lemon cut in slices. 

FRESH MEAT GRIDDLES. 

Chop all the bits of cold fresh beef or veal, season 
with salt and pepper, make a nice batter, grease your 
griddle and put on a spoonful of ba'tter, then one of 
meat, then another of batter, when fried on one side 
turn over ; these are nice for a breakfast dish. 

A BEEF OR VEAIi PIE. 

Take the cold pieces after baking and make a light 
crust, quite short ; lay it in your basin, put in your 
pieces of meat with butter, pepper, and salt, adding a 
little water ; put on a cover, and bake an hour. 

A BEEF'S HEART. 

Cut it open on both sides, (this is usually done by the 
butcher,) wash clean, make a nice stufiing, and fill up, 
then tie with a bit of twine, and roast or bake until 
tender; it is better if boiled about twenty minutes 
before stuffing ; garnish with cloves and eat with jelly. 
It is nice boiled and fried in butter, or smoked, and 
then fried, in which case it must be corned first. 

CALVES' HEAD. 

Clean well and soak in water to make it look white, 
leave the skin on, take out the tongue to pickle, and 
the brains ; boil the head tender, put in some parsley 
and a little butter, brown nice and take up. The brains 
must be boiled by themselves, then put in butter, sage, 
pepper, and salt. Another way : Boil the head almost 
tender, take ofi* nearly all the meat off the bone and 



AND HOIJSEKEEPEe's AID. 29 

put in a dish ; beat up the yolks of two eggs and turn 
over, tlien cover with bread-crumbs, a little summer 
savory or sage nicely sifted, pepper, salt, and one nut- 
meg'if you like ; mix well together before putting on ; 
put the dish in the oven and brown it, then slice the 
rest of the head and skin the tongue, then slice it ; put 
some gravy in a pan with parsley, sage, savory, pepper, 
and salt, stir in some flour while boiling hot, having 
previously wet it with cold water to prevent it being 
lumpy, turn over the rest, then beat up the brains, and 
add two spoonfuls of catsup ; simmer the whole to- 
gether. 

CALVES' FEET. 

Boil them tender, roll in flour, and fry browm, make 
a gravy and season with salt, pepper, and mace, add 
wine if you like. They can be boiled with the head if 
liked, and then split open to garnish it by laymg around 
the head. 

SWEETBREADS. 

Boil them tender; then add cream, butter, pepper, 
Bait, and nutmeg, if you like, stir in a little flour to thick- 
en the gravy ; or they may be parboiled, then dij) in 
flour, with sweet herbs, pej^per, and salt. They are also 
nice fried with liver. 

MUTTON". 

The saddle is the best to corn, and then boil, and 
eat cold. It is also the best to roast or fry. It is also 
nice broiled. The neck is best made into soup. For 
roasting the saddle, you can cut gashes, and fill with a 
stufling made of bread soaked soft, a spoonful of butter, 
two eggs, with sweet herbs. Kub the outside with salt, 
pepper, clove, and allspice. Put water in the dripping- 
pan, and baste often. Turn the bony side down first, 
then turn after cooking awhile. Allow a quarter of an 
hour to each pound ; if done too much, it will be tough. 
After taking up, thicken the gravy with flour, and sea- 
son with spices and catsup. Wine or currant-jelly is 
nice in the gravy. Celery is nice to garnish the dish. 
Onions are nice served with mutton. 



30 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

HOTCH POTCH. 

Take a little corned beef, or a ham-bone, peas, let- 
tuce, and onions in a little water. While stewing, fry 
some mutton or lamb-steaks, seasoned to a good brown. 
Put the steaks in a spider, and turn the vegetables over 
them, and let them stew three quarters of an hour. 

MUTTON" EOASTED. 

Take the fat out of a loin, and joint it at every bone, 

dip it into the yolks of three well-beaten eggs, and dip 

into a mixture of bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, 

and sweet herbs ; place them together as they Avere 

before, tie them, and roast quick. Make a gravy, and 

serve hot. 

GRILLED LAMB. 

Cut it in squares, about an inch long, (not cut in 
pieces, only hashed,) rub with butter, the yolk of an 
egg, pepper, salt, and bread-crumbs, any kind of sweet 
herbs you like ; put in the dripping-pan, with a pint of 
water, and baste often. It will not require much roast- 
ing. Season the gravy with the juice and grated rind 
of a lemon, and a spoonful of tomato catsup. It is also 
good roasted, without the egg. 

VENISON. 

Yenison should not be overdone, as it tends to dry 
the meat. It is nice fried, broiled, or roasted. In the 
latter case, it should be eaten with currant-jelly. 

CHICKENS. 

Chickens six months old are the best, as they are 
more tender ; but if a year old, they are still nice. After 
having the head chopped off, they should be hung by 
tlie feet, so as to bleed freely. When boiled, they 
should always be put into cold water, as they are less 
liable to break. When roasted, they should be stuffed, 
sewed up, and laid on a dripping-pan, with water, and 
baste often. Lay slices of salt pork on top while cook- 
ing. 

FRICASSEE. 

Cut them up, or rather joint them; wash well; then 
put in a kettle — a quart of water to a chicken ; let them 



AND housekeeper's AID. 31 

boil until half done ; then put in a lump of butter, salt, 
and pejDper ; let it cook down, to about a tea-cupful of 
gravy ; then stir in flour, wet with water. Toast bread, 
and butter it ; turn on boiling water enough to soak ; 
then turn on the chicken. Pork may be put in, instead 
of butter, but it will require less salt, and should be put 
in when the chicken is put over, say two small slices to 
one chicken. 

BROILED CHICKENS. 

Take out the breast-bone, and beat well ; then lay on 
the gridiron, and turn a tin on top ; let it half broil ; 
turn over, and finish cooking. It must broil slow, or it 
will burn ; season with butter, pepper, and salt. It may 
be fried in butter, after dipping in bread-crumbs or 
flour, or dipped in egg first. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

It must be jointed, and boiled until tender; have a 
pudding-dish, lined with pie-crust ; put in the chicken, 
with salt, butter, and pepper ; sprinkle flour over the 
top ; then turn on the liquor which the chicken was 
boiled in ; put a crust on ; cut in the middle ; and orna- 
ment the top with jiastry. Bake in a slow oven an 
hour. Any pieces of cold meat, beef, veal, venison, or 
mutton, may be made the same. 

CHICKEN PUDDING. 

Stew a pair, as above ; then take out of the liquor to 
cool ; then beat five eggs ; turn in a quart of milk ; stir 
in a quart of wheat-flour, a tea-spoonful of salt ; cover 
the bottom of the pudding-dish ; then a layer of chicken, 
(having previously seasoned it while cooking,) and so 
on, until the dish is filled ; lastly, a layer of pudding. 
Bake three quarters of an hour, or until brown. Stir 
an egg into the liquor, which can be served hot with 
the pudding. 

CHICKEN POT-PIE. 

Joint the chickens, and boil until tender ; season with 
butter, salt, and joepper. Take an egg and beat it light ; 
put it into a pint of sour milk, half cream is better ; if 
not, melt some butter, and turn in ; stu- in flour, a tea- 



82 EXCELSIOE COOK BOOK 

spoonful of salt, add half a tea-spoonful of saleratus ; stu- 
well, and drop with a sjDOon into the kettle, while boil- 
ing. Let it boil half an hour, and take up. If it re- 
mains too long, the crust will be heavy. Two potatoes 
should be added before the crust is put in. Another 
method, and still better, but more trouble : Take light 
bread-dough, and mould in half a tea-cupful of butter, 
and let it rise ; then cut in squares, and put a layer of 
crust, then a layer of chicken, until fdled ; cover the 
whole with a crust. It may be made of cream of tartar, 
like biscuits. Veal or mutton can be made the same. 

CHICKEN" SALAD. 

Boil chickens tender, and cut up in small bits, or 
chop in a chopping-bowl. Take heads of celery and 
chop, then wash clean in cold water. Take double the 
quantity of celery that you have chicken. Put in a 
dish and make a dressing of two thirds of a tea-cupfal 
of vinegar, two eggs beat to a froth, two spoonfuls of 
melted butter, a tea-spoonful of mixed mustard, the 
same of salt, and a little black pepper. This quantity 
is for two chickens. Stir the whole over a slow fire 
until thick. When cold, mix with the chicken and 
celery. 

KOAST TURKET. 

Having washed the turkey clean, prepare the follow- 
ing dressing : Take light bread and soak in cold water ; 
mix a spoonful of butter, salt and pepper, a spoonful 
of powdered sage, the same of savory. An egg makes 
the dressing cut smoother. If you like, cook the liver, 
heart, and gizzard tender, and chop with a few cold po- 
tatoes. Fill crop first and sew up, then the body. Tie 
up the legs and wings. Rub on butter and salt. Put a 
tea-cupful of water in the dripping-pan, and roast from 
two to three hours, according to their size ; baste often. 
Make a gravy when done of the drippings. If the in- 
wards are not put in for stufiing, they can be cooked 
tender and added to the gravy. 

BOILED TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 

Prepare them the same as for roasting. Tie in a 
cloth to have it look white. A bit of pork boiled with. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 33 

tliem improves the flavor. Use drawn butter for sauce. 
Th-e liquor can be made into soup. They should be 
put into cold water, not hot. 

A very nice way^to cook turkey or chicken : Take 
a sharp knife, and "scrape downwards. Begin at the 
wings, but do not break the skin, nor tear the flesh. 
Loosen the flesh from breast, back and thighs. Draw 
the skeleton by the neck from the flesh, then stufl" with 
a nice dressing, and sew up. Bake three hours and 
serve cold. This mode requires some experience, but 
when done is very nice. 

TO ROAST GEESE AND DUCKS. 

They should be put into boiling water and stir around 
two or three minutes, when the feathers and down 
will come off as easy as off a chicken if right done. 
The feathers will not wet through, but they will steam. 
Then singe by lighting a bit of paper and holding over 
until all the fine hairs are ofi*. Then dress nicely and 
wash clean. Boil an hour or more, according to their 
age. When some tender take them out and have a 
stuffing made as for a turkey ; fill the body and sew 
up. Roast a nice brown, turning on the water they 
were boiled in. Make a gravy of the drippings. Eat 
with onions or apple-sauce. 

TO ROAST SlflPSS OR "WOODCOCKS. 

The flavor is best preserved without stuffing; but 
flour and baste until done. Toast a couj)le of slices of 
bread and dip in the dripping to lay on the dish. Put 
them on and make a gravy of butter and flour. To 
take away the fishy taste which some wild fowls have, 
take an onion, salt and hot water, and baste a few 
times, then Avith butter. 

TO BOIL A DUCK OR RABBIT. 

Use a good deal of water, and skim often. Wlien 
done put in a little cream, butter, pepper, salt, parsley, 
chopped ; stew a few minutes, then add flour and take 
up. A rabbit is nice made into a pot-pie or fricasseed 
like chickens. They may be stufied and roasted, and 
will only require an hour ; baste often with butter. 
2* 



34 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

PIGEO]SrS. 

Make a dressing as for a turkey, and fill and sew up. 
Put tliem in a pot, breast side down, season with salt 
and pepper. If old, they will require a great deal of 
cooking. When nearly done, put in butter and stew 
down. Thicken the gravy with flour. They are nice 
stewed or made into a pot-pie, or made with a crust 
and baked like a chicken pie. 

TO STE^W BIRDS. 

Make stuffing of bread, butter or salt pork, pepper 
and salt ; fill and sew up. Lay in slices of bacon or 
pork and a quart of water. Add onions and sweet 
herbs if you like. Make a gravy. 

BEEP OR VEAL STE'WED. 

Put a i^iece of butter in a stew-pan, cut the meat in 
small slices, and lay in with apples sliced thin, add 
pepper and salt. If liked, add onions. Cover tight 
and stew until done. 

A SAUSAGE STEW. 

Put a layer of peeled potatoes sliced in a kettle, then 
a layer of sausage, then another layer of potatoes, and 
so on until all are in. Season with 2Depper and salt ; 
then pour on water, and if the sausages are very lean, 
add bits of ham or butter. Cook until the potatoes are 
well cooked. 

TO BOIL CORISTED BEEP. 

Put in cold water enough to cover it nicely. Cover 
closely and boil slowly. Some think it much improved 
by letting it remain in the liquor all night. The liquor 
is good to boil cabbage and turnips, also potatoes. 
Corned beef is the best for hash. 

VEAL OR MUTTON" HARICOT. 

Put some slices of veal or mutton in a stew-pan, 
season with pepper and salt. Drippings or butter 
should be put in first. Then add celery, onions, car- 
rots ; havmg previously cooked them tender, add to- 
mato catsup and s^^ice if you like. Let them stew ten 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 36 

minutes, then lay the meat in a dish and turn the vege- 
tables over. Peas and cucumbers maybe used instead. 

VEAL BALLS. 

Chop cold veal, as much salt pork, mix with as much 
bread-crumbs. Moisten Avith Av^hite wine and two 
eggs, season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, sweet herbs. 
Make into balls and fry in butter. They should be 
dipped in flour first. 

TO POT VEAL. 

Take veal that has been boiled and sliced, smoked 
tongue boiled and the skin taken off, also sliced. Pound 
each separately very fine, and moisten with butter as 
you proceed. Put in a stone jar and mix well. Press 
down and turn on melted butter. When cut it must 
look variegated. Keep it covered in a dry j^lace. 
When used cut in slices. Ham is nice used instead of 
tongue. 

CURKIED DISHES. 

Chickens and veal are best for curries. But they 
can be made, and are nice, of mutton chops, pigeons, 
and other meats. Chicken should be jointed and boiled 
tender. Take them up and put some butter in a stew- 
pan, fry them brown ; then pour on part of the liquor 
in which the meat was boiled, nearly enough to cover 
it. To two chickens or to four pounds of pork, put 
in a tea-cupful of boiled rice, a table-spoonful of curry- 
powder, one of butter, one of flour, a little salt, and a 
tea-cup of the liquor, mix all together, and pour over 
the meat. Let it cook twenty miimtes slowly. Eat 
boiled rice with it. 

PHEASANTS AISTD PABTRIDGES. 

Stuff and roast like turkey, and serve with onions. 
They are nice stewed. When cold, they may be made 
into patties. 

TO POT BIRDS. 

Clean them well, then season with allspice, mace, 
pepper and salt. Rub every part well, and lay them 
in a pan, the breast downwards, and pack close. Put 



86 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

plenty of butter on them and make a coarse flour-paste, 
with a paper over, and bake. When cold cut into 
pieces and pack close in a jar. Cover with butter. 
The butter will answer for basting or for meat-pies. 

GUINEA AND PEA FOWTL 

are dressed like a turkey, and eat very much like 

pheasants. 

BAKED OR BOASTED PIG. 

Take a young pig, which should be fat, five or six 
weeks old, cut off the first joints, and wash thoroughly 
outside and inside. Prepare a stufiing as for a turkey. 
If you have any fresh meat cooked, put some in the 
dressing, with a quarter of a pound of salt pork. Fill 
up and fasten tight. Put it into a dripping-pan, tie 
the legs, and put a grate or something in the dripping 
to keep it up. Turn in a pint of water. Swab every 
fifteen minutes with salt and water. Rub a little but- 
ter over it to keep it from blistering. It must bake 
from two to three hours. When done, expose to the 
air a few minutes to make it crispy. Make a gravy of 
flour and the brains, cooked, if you like. 

BOILED HAM. 

Take a ham weighing twenty pounds, and boil five 
hours ; then take out and skin the whole. Put it in a 
slow oven half an hour; then cover it with bread- 
crumbs and put in again ; let it remain half an hour 
longer. Garnish with cloves. Baking ham an hour 
after boiling is a great improvement to the flavor. 

FOR COOKING COLD HAM. 

Take all the bits and pieces, put in a frying-pan ; if 
lean, put in some butter ; cover close until warmed 
through ; then break in some eggs, and stir constantly 
until they are cooked. 

BROILED HAM. 

Cut in slices, take ofl" the rind and lay on the grid- 
iron over hot coals two minutes ; turn over and let it 
remain as long ; take up and season with pejiper, butter, 
and tuTO on a tablgTspoonful of hot water. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 37 

TO BOAST A SPARE RIB. 

This should be cut thick ; rub flour, salt, sage, and 
pepper on ; lay on a dripping-pan, with a little water 
in, the bony side down ; baste often, and cook an hour 
and a half. It must cook slowly. 

TO COOK BOILED HAM. 

Make a batter of eggs, milk, and flour, add a little 
salt, pour some on a dripping-pan, and fry three min- 
utes, having put a little butter in ; then cover the batter 
with thin slices of ham, and pour on more batter. Let 
it fry until a nice brown, then cut in squares, and turn 
over and let it fry on the other side. 

TO KEEP HAM. 

Cut in slices to broil or fry, and pack in jars ; heat 
lard and turn on top, cover close, and keep in a cool place. 

TO FRY HAM. 

Cut in slices and fry quickly, but not too much ; when 
done, take up, and fry eggs in the gravy. 

SOUSE. 

Clean pigs' feet, and ears if you like, (although there 
is not much meat on them,) soak them in salt and water 
three days, changing the water every day ; boil six 
hours, then turn on hot, sj^iced vinegar. Fry in lard or 
eat out of the vinegar ; a nicer way is to dry them after 
taking out of the vinegar, and dipping in a beaten egg, 
then in flour or bread-crumbs, then fry. 

HEAD-CHEESE. 

Clean the head, feet, and bony pieces, after cutting 
ofl' sausage-meat, and boil all together until tender ; 
then put in a chopping-bowl and take out all the bones, 
chop fine ; add pepper, salt, sweet herbs, put in a bag, 
put on a weight, and let it remain till cold. It can be 
eaten cold, sliced up, or Avarmed up with vinegar. 

SCRAPEIi. 

Save the liquor after boiling the head and feet, strain 
to get out all the bones, take off some of the fat, pour 
the liquor back into the kettle. If you have six quarts 



38 EXCELSIOE COOK BOOK 

of liquor, add two quarts of c]iopi:)ed meat, season with 
pepper and salt to the taste ; Avhen boiling hot, stir in 
Indian meal, or buckwheat flour, or half and half, just 
as you like. When as thick as hasty pudding, take up, 
and when wanted for use cut oif slices and fry ; there 
should be fat enough to fry itself. This makes a nice 
breakfast dish. 

ROAST POKE. 

Take a sharp knife and cut in squares, or all one way, 
through the rind ; rub on salt, pepper, and sage ; put in 
a dripping-pan, with a cupful of water ; set in the oven 
and bake from two to three hours. If a leg is to be 
baked, take out the bone, and fill with a stuffing of 
bread, pepper, salt, and sage ; fasten it up ; roast a fine 
brown, and serve with apple-sauce ; make a gravy of 
flour. This is called mock goose, and is very nice. 

HAM ROASTED. 

Make a stuffing as for a turkey, take out the bone 
and fill up with the dressing, put into a dripping-pan 
with water, and cook until tender ; make a gravy of 
flour. It is better to boil two hours in a cloth before 
baking, then take offi the skin and rub bread-crumbs on 
top. 

TO FRY SALT PORK. 

Soak in cold water until freshened sufficient, then dip 
in flour and fry brown, or make a batter and dip in. 
You can cut it in slices and put in a sj^ider, pour cold 
water on and just let it boil, take out and turn out the 
water, then put the meat back and fry to a nice brown. 
Take up, and stir up a large spoonful of flour with a 
pint of rich milk, (water will answer,) and pour in ; 
when thick, take up. 

PORK STEAKS. 

Cut in slices and broil the same as beef, only slower 
and longer. When done, season with butter, pej^per, 
and salt ; add catsup if liked. They are nice fried, 
seasoned with sage, pepper, and salt, or dip in egg and 
flour, like veal cutlets. 



A'N'D housekeeper's AID. 39 

A PORK STEW. 

Take a few slices of fresh pork, a dozen potatoes 
pared, put into a kettle with water to cover them ; let 
them cook an hour and a half; keep well covered while 
cooking ; add salt and pepper, and put on top slices of 
bread ; this is a nice Avay to use up the dry pieces which 
may have been left ; let it simmer live minutes, and take 
lip. Salt pork may be used, but in that case no salt 
will be required. A pie may be made of pork the same 
as a veal or a chicken pie, only slice a few potatoes in. 

TO MAKE A CHOWDER. 
Cut a few slices of pork and fry brown, then take 
them out and lay in fish cut lengthwise, then a layer of 
crackers, very thin sliced potatoes, shced onions, with 
some of the pork, and then a layer of fish again, and so 
on ; add a little salt and pepper over each layer, also a 
sliced lemon ; pour over the whole a bowlful of flour 
and water well stirred up ; it must cover the whole ; 
cover tight, that the steam can not escape ; it must not 
be opened until done. 

PORK SAUSAGES. 

Take one third fat to two thirds of lean pork ; take 
out all the bones ; cut in strips, and run through a 
sausage-cutter ; to every pound of meat, add a large 
spoonful of sweet herbs, a heaping tea-spoonful of salt, 
and the same of pepper; mix well, and fill your 
casings, or pack in jars, turning melted lard to keep 
the air from it. When used, make into little cakes, 
by flouring your hand to keep them from sticking; 
also, to make them fry better. Fry slowly, and when 
done, make a gravy of flour. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT. 

To twelve pounds of meat, add twelve large spoon- 
fuls of sage, eight of salt, six of black pepper ; you 
may add half a tea-cupful of brown sugar, if you like, 
and a very little saltpetre ; they will keep better. It 
is always well to take out some of the meat after mix- 
ing, and fry, and if not seasoned sufficient, add more.

flour, and water. 

TO ROAST A HAUNCH OP VENISON.

goose, and let it remain four days, turning three or four 
times every day ; when ready to cook, drain and wipe 
dry ; lard with salt pork ; bake or stew slowly ; baste 
with currant wine or jelly, and water. Seasoned goose 
is excellent cooked as Boeuf a la Mode. 

A BONED TUBKEY. 

Have the turkey nicely dressed ; then take a sharp 
knife, and commence at the wings, carefully separating 
the flesh from the bones, scraping it down as you go ; 
do not break the skin. Next loosen the flesh from 
the breast, back, and thighs lastly. When all the flesh 
is loosened, take the turkey by the neck, and pull the 
skeleton out; take a needle and sew up the skin, if 
broken ; then commence stuffing, first the wings, next 
the body, and then the thighs. It must be stufied hard, 
and if properly done, will assume its natural shape. 
Sew up the breast, and skewer it into its proper form. 
Bake three hours. Any large fowl may be boned and 
stufled in the same way.

bread ; serve hot. Any other kind of meat may be pre- 
pared in the same way.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 

DRAAATN BUTTEK. 

Take a table-spoonful of flour, with just water enough 
to mix well, then pour in a little more, (after the lumps 
are out,) and stir up ; then stir in one tea-cupful of boil- 
ing water ; let it boil up ; then remove to where it will 
keep warm, but not boil ; put in a quarter of a pound 
of butter, and let it stand until melted, when it will be 
ready for use. It must be free from lumps. If used 
for fish, put in boiled eggs, sliced up, or capers. If re- 
quired for curry sauce, sprinkle in curry-powder. 

BUKNT BUTTER. 

Heat three ounces of butter, until it is a nice brown ; 
add half a tea-cupful of good vinegar, half a tea-spoon- 
ful of salt, and a third of a tea-spoonful of pe23per. This 
is a nice sauce for fish or eggs. 

DRA-WJSr MEAT GRAVY, OR BRO^WN GRAVIES. 

Put into a saucepan, a pound of fresh chopped meat, 
two table-spoonfuls of melted butter, salt, and pepper ; 
let it brown nicely, taking care that it does not stick ; 
pour on a pint of boiling water, and let it simmer three 
hours ; skim well ; then strain it, and cover up tight till 
wanted. When used, thicken with brown flour, a tea- 
spoonful to half a pint. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

Take a quart of oyster sauce, a stick of mace, pepper, 
and salt. If you have not juice sufiicient, put one third 
water ; then take two table-spoonfuls of flour, wet 
smooth with a tea-cupful of milk. When it has boil- 
ed up, put a quart of oysters in, and a piece of butter 
the size of a hen's egg ; take up after boiling a few min- 
utes, as boiling makes oysters shrivel up. Serve with 

poultry. 

CELERY VINEGAR. 

Pound in a mortar two gills of celery seed, and add 
good vinegar ; shake every day for a week or two. It 
must be kept corked and sealed.

58 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

CELERY SAUCE FOR BOILED FOWLS. 

Take the green toj^s off of four heads of celery, and cut 
into small pieces, and boil in half a pint of water, until 
tender. Mix two table-spoonfuls of flour with half a 
cup of milk ; stir in with salt, and butter. When it 
boils, take up. 

LIVER SAUCE FOR FISH. 

Boil the liver of the fish, until tender enough to mash 
fine ; stir it into drawn butter ; add a spoonful of cat- 
sup, salt, and pepper. A little lemon or vinegar is an 
improvement. 

CRA]SrBERRY SAUCE. 

Stew them in water, until tender ; then add sugar, 
and let it scald well. Strain if you like, but I prefer 
without. 

APPLE SAUCE. 

Pare and core tart apples ; stew until tender, then 
sweeten, and add a little butter ; a little lemon or nut- 
meg is an imj^rovement. Another way is to take sweet 
a23ples, pare and quarter nicely ; then dry one day ; 
then take new cider, which has been boiled down rich, 
one quart to one and a half of water, and stew slowly 
from two to three hours, in brass or tin. This will 
keep six months if made rich ; a few quinces add very 
much to the flavor. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Take the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, two spoon- 
fuls of melted butter, or salad oil, a mustard-spoonful 
of mustard, some of the lobster spawn, six spoonfuls of 
vinegar, salt, and pepper.

Peel two or three onions, slice them, fry them brown 
in butter, sprinkle salt, pepper, flour, and sweet-mar- 
joram or thyme; add half a pint of the liquor in which 
the poultry was boiled or roasted, some of the drip- 
pings, and a large spoonful of catsup.

absorbed, stir in a gill of milk, a tea-spoonful of salt, 
and strain it. This is nice for game. 

HEKB SPIRIT. 

Take sweet herbs, such as sage, summer savory, 
thyme, sweet basil, sweet marjoram; drjj them; then

Take half a pint of drawn butter ; put in sweet mar- 
joram, pepper, and salt, the juice and rind of half a 
lemon. When taken from the fire, add a wine-glass of

"WINE SAUCE FOR VENISOK" OR MUTTOK". 

Warm half a pint of the drippings ; wet a little flour 
to thicken ; and season with salt, pepper, and cloves, 
just removing from the fire a glass of wine, or currant- 

BRO^WNING FOR MADE DISHES. 

Put a pound of good brown sugar in a saucej^an, 
stir it constantly over a slow fire ; boil till quite thick 
and brown, but do not burn it ; take it off" the fire, and 
stir in slowly a quart of boiling water ; set it on the 
fire, and boil up, then turn out, and when cold, bottle 
it. This will keep a year, and a very little serves for 
soujDS, gravies or sauces. 

TOMATO SAUCE. 

Take one peck of green tomatoes, slice them, one 
dozen small onions, sliced ; sprinkle over them a little 
salt, then let them remain twenty-four hours; drain 
them and add one quarter of a pound mustard-seed, 
whole, one box ground mustard, one ounce of pepper, 
one of allspice, the same of ginger ; cover them with 
vinegar and boil slowly three hours, or until transparent. 

SALAD DRESSING, 

Take one cup of good vinegar, a tea-spoonful of oil, 
or melted butter, one of made mustard, the yolk of a 
hard-boiled egg rubbed fine, a salt-spoonful of salt; 
pour over the salad and send to the table. 



60 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

PEPPER SAUCE. 

Take a dozen ripe pepper-pods, cut them in two, lay 
them in a kettle with three pints of vinegar, and boil 
to one quart ; strain through a sieve. This gives a 
flavor greatly superior to black pepper : it is also nice 
when added to catsup for fish-sauce. 

DilA"WN BUTTER. No. 2. 

Take a few spoonfuls of flour, wet with cold water 
until all the lumps are out, then turn in a little more 
water ; stir up, and then turn on boiling water enough 
to make a thick paste ; put in one third as much butter 
as you have of gravy ; let it remain where it is warm 
imtil melted, when it is fit for use. If used for fish, put 
in boiled eggs sliced up, or capers. Curry-sauce is the 
same, by sprinkling in a little curry-powder. 

BURNT BUTTER. No. 2. 

Put a quarter of a pound of butter in frying-pan, 
and brown nicely without being burnt, then add a cup- 
ful of vinegar ; season with salt and pepper. This is

water, add a tea-cupful of bread-crumbs, a glass of 
port wine, six cloves, and a piece of butter ; stir until

Boil a couple of eggs three minutes, take off the 
shells, and then mix them with half a tea-cupful of 
vinegar, half a cup of butter or salad oil, a tea-spoon- 
ful of made mustard, a little salt and pepper ; if you 
like, add catsup. 

PUDDING- SAUCE. 

Stir half a tea-cujD of butter to one of sugar to a 
cream ; the more it is stirred the nicer it is ; flavor 
with nutmeg, lemon, or wine, according to the taste. 
Another way of making sauce is to stir butter and a 
spoonful of flour togetlier until free from lumps ; turn 
on hot water sufficient to thicken to the proper con- 



AND HOUSEKEEPEK's AID. 6l 

sistency; add sugar, and any kind of flavoring you like. 
Brandy is nice for this kind. 

CURRY-POWDER. 

Mix an ounce of black pej^per, mustard, ginger, 
each, three of coriander seed, the same of tumeric, one 
quarter of an ounce Cayenne pepper, half an ounce car- 
damus, the same of cummin-seed and cinnamon ; pound 
the whole fine, sift, and keep in a bottle corked tight. 

TOMATO SOY. 

Put ripe tomatoes in a dish, (having previously 
pricked them with a fork,) to each layer sprinkle a 
little salt ; let them remain three or four days, then 
put them in vinegar for one night ; the next day drain 
off the vinegar ; put the tomatoes in a jar with sliced 
onions in alternate layers, sprmkle spices between each 
layer, allowing half a pint of English mustard-seed, 
half an ounce of ground cloves and pepper to each 
peck of tomatoes. They are good in ten or twelve 
days. 

TO MIX MUSTARD. 

Take a cup of ground mustard, mix with cold vine- 
gar, enough to make a paste, add a tea-spoonful of 
salt, a heaping tea-spoonful of sugar ; then thin with 
scalding hot vinegar, otherwise it will have a raw

Take half a pound of butter, the same of brown sugar, 
and stir to a cream ; beat the yolk of an egg, and put 
in with a gill of Avine ; let it simmer on the stove a few 
minutes, stirring all the time ; when taken up, grate in 
a little nutmeg. 

Sweet cream, seasoned with nutmeg or lemon, wine 
or brandy if you like, is a nice sauce for puddings. 
Sweet cream and jelly alone is nice. 

SAUCE FOR GOOSE, DUCK, OR LAMB. 
Chop green mint and add vinegar, with a little 



62 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

DKESSING FOR A GOOSE OB DUCK. 

Bread-crumbs, onion, sage, pepper, salt, cold pota- 
toes, parsley and egg, to make it cut nice. The same 
for a turkey except the onions. 

CLARIFIED BUTTER. 

Put the butter in a kettle over the fire, when melted 
skim off the buttermilk ; let it stand two or three min- 
utes, and then strain into a jar for use. Butter pre- 
pared in this way is as sweet as marrow. 

OYSTER DRESSING FOR BOILED FOWLS. 

Take one pint of oysters, bread-crumbs, butter, pep- 
per and salt ; mince the oysters, and add an egg.

melted butter. 

SCORCHED FLOUR.

SOUPS. 
If uncooked meat is used, allow a pound to one 
quart of water. Put the meat into cold water and 



64 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

heat gradually. If cooked too fast the albumen coagu- 
lates and hardens the meat ; prevents the water from 
penetrating, consequently the flavor is lost and the 
meat tough. Be careful to skim as soon as any thing 
rises on the top, and then throw in a little salt to 
bring up the scum. Keep it well covered up to pre- 
vent the flavor from escaping. If more water is 
needed, add boiling water, as cold spoils the soup. 
When tender, take it out and skim well, and then 
season with pepper and salt, adding any vegetables 
you like, or sweet herbs ; thicken with rice, barley, ver- 
micelli, or little flour-balls. As potato-water is not 
considered healthy, it is not best to put in much, or 
else boil by themselves and add afterward. Cold roast 
beef or beefsteak may be made into soup. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Boil the shank of beef in sufficient water to cover it 
until tender ; take up and take off" the fat. Put in a 
cup of rice or macaroni broken into small bits, or lit- 
tle flour-balls. Season with pepper, salt, and catsup ; 
if you have not catsup, add a few powdered cloves. 
Slice up two onions, one potato, and one carrot. Boil 
until tender. 

PORTABLE SOUP. 

Take the liquor in which beef or veal has been 
boiled, and skin off the fat ; then boil do^vn the liquor 
to thick consistency. Season highly with pepper, salt, 
cloves, and allspice ; add wine or brandy, and turn on 
platters, not over three quarters of an inch in thick- 
ness. When cold cut in squares and set in the sun to 
dry, turning often. When perfectly dry, put in an 
earthen vessel, with a piece of white paper between 
each layer. Whenever you wish to make a soup, take 
one of them to a quart of water, heating it scalding 
hot ; add vegetables if you like. These will keep a 
long time. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take the liquor in which any kind of fresh meat 
has been boiled ; but mutton or lamb is the best ; skim 
off the fat, and to four quarts of liquor put in two car- 



AND housekeeper's AID. 65 

rots sliced, and let them boil twenty minutes ; then 
add two onions, two potatoes, two turnips, two toma- 
toes, sliced thin ; season with salt and pepper to the 
taste. When tender take up. 

PEA SOUP. 

Take dry peas and soak over night in cold water, 
the next morning boil in the same water an hour ; just 
before taking up, add a tea-spoonful of saleratus ; then 
turn into a colander to drain, and then put back again 
with a piece of pork, pouring on fresh water ; boil un- 
til soft. Green peas need not boil more than an hour. 
Dry beans may be cooked the same way. 

TOMATO SOUP.! 

Boil beef or veal until tender, then skin well and 
cut up half a dozen ripe tomatoes or green, just as 
you prefer ; pare them first. Season with sugar, pep- 
per, and salt ; cloves, if you like. 

CHICKE]Sr OR TURKEY SOUP 

After boiling tender, skin off the fat and put in a 
cupful of rice and a head of celery, pepper, and salt. 
Pour on crackers or toasted bread. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Make a rich soup of any kind of meat ; old fowls are 
nice. Add a few slices of ham, two onions, one head 
of celery, pepper, and salt, sweet herbs, if you like. 
Strain it and add a quarter of a pound of vermicelli 
which has been scalded in boiling water. Put in Cay- 
enne pepper, and let it boil five minutes. The meat 
must be boiled until it falls from the bones. Turn on 
toasted bread. 

FORCE-MEAT BALLS. 

Take two thirds lean veal, one third raw, salt pork, 
chop fine ; season with curry-powder, pepper, salt, or 
leave out the curry and add cloves. Make up into 
balls the size of an hen's egg ; boil half in the soup 
fifteen minutes, and fry the remainder and serve in a 
separate dish. For beef soup, add beef and eggs, it 
will make them hold together better. 



66 EXCELSIOE COOK BOOK 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Pat two quarts of water in a stewpan, and when 
boiling, add three pints of oysters. Season with salt, 
pepper, and stir smooth two large spoonfuls of flour ; 
add with it a quarter of a pound of butter. Let them 
boil five minutes and no longer ; as much boiling makes 
them hard and tough. You may add a pint of milk if 
preferred, or half milk and half water. Salt should 
not be put in until ready to take up, as they shrink 
from the efiects of it. 

MOCK-TURTLE SOUP. 

Take a calf's head and divide the upper from the 
lower part, also a knuckle of veal to make force-meat 
balls to be added ; put in a gallon of water and boil 
until tender. Skim carefully, and season with pepper, 
salt, mace, sweet herbs, curry-powder or cloves. Three 
sliced potatoes may be added, and the juice of two 
lemons, also the yolks of six eggs boiled hard. Just 
before taking up add half a jDint of white wine ; add 
half your force-meat balls, and fry the remainder. 
The brains can be j)ut in the balls after cooking them 
tender. 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

Boil a knuckle of veal in a gallon of water, down to 
two quarts ; strain the juice of the oysters to get out 
the pieces of shell. Put in the oysters, season with 
pepper, salt, adding two spoonfuls of flour, or eight 
rolled crackers, and half pint of rich milk. Butter the 
size of an egg. Be careful not to cook the oysters 
until they shrink. 

CLAM SOUP. 

"Wash a peck of clams and put them in a stewpan 
with a pint of water, and when they open strain the 
juice, and add a pint of milk, the same of water ; when 
they boil, stir in two spoonfuls of flour and a lump of 
butter the size of an egg ; add pepper and mace if you 
like. 

MACARONI SOUP. 

Make a nice veal soup and season with salt, pepper, 
parsley, and onions. Break in pieces a quarter of a 



AND housekeeper's AID. 67 

pound of macaroni, and simmer in milk until tender. 
Strain and add to the soup. Stir in two large spoon- 
fuls of flour and a pint of cream. 

MACAROWI SOUP. NO. 2. 

Boil six pounds of beef with two Onions, one carrot, 
half a turnip, and a head of celery. Boil until tender. 
Turn into a pan and let it cool. Skim off the fat and 
pour off into the kettle half an hour before used, leav- 
ing out the sediment. Add half a pint of macaroni, 
broken into small pieces. Season to the taste, and 
add a table-spoonful of tomato catsup. 

GIBLET SOUP. 

Take the giblets of two fowls, the feet, neck, and 
pinions, add a pound of veal and a piece of ham. Cut 
the giblets and meat into half-inch pieces. Pour on 
cold water and boil until tender. Strain the liquor, 
and when cold take off the fat. Add a table-spoonful 
of flour and one of butter, with sweet herbs tied in a 
bag ; season with salt and pepper. Boil a few minutes 
and then serve. 

PEPPER POT. 

Take an ox-heel or any other part of the beef, and 
boil till tender, not forgetting to skim well ; when nearly 
done, add carrot, turnip, two onions, and two pota- 
toes sliced. Put in Cayenne pejDper, black pepper, and 
salt. Make a crust as for pastry, and roll thin, then 
cut in strip's half a finger long, and half an inch in 
width. Put in half an hour before taking up. 

LOBSTER SOUP. 

Take three young hen lobsters, spit the tails, take 
out the fish and crack the claws, cut the meat into 
mouthfuls ; take out the coral and the soft part of the 
body, bruise part of the coral in a mortar, pick out 
the fish from the chines, beat part of it with the coral, 
and with this make force-meat balls. Have three 
quarts of veal broth, bruise the legs and the chine ; 
put them into it to boil twenty minutes, then strain it, 
and to thicken it, take the live spawn and bruise it in 
a mortar with a little butter and flour ; rub it through 



68 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

a sieve, and add to it the soup with the meat of the 

lobster and the remaining coral, let it simmer very 

gently ten minutes. Do not let it boil or the color 

will fade ; turn into a tureen and add the juice of a 

lemon. 

"WHITE SOUP. 

Take a turkey or chicken, have it nicely dressed 
and cut up ; boil slowly until tender, then add celery, 
carrots, onions, salt, rice, and pepper. When done, 
add a tea-cupful of sweet cream. This is a nice 
method of cooking old fowls. 

OCHRA SOUP. 

Fry a chicken, cut up, to a light brown, also a slice 
of ham. Pour on hot water, and add two onions with 
sweet herbs tied up in a rag. Simmer until tender, 
then add two dozen ochras cut in slices, and half a 
tea-cup of rice. Boil half an hour, and then put in a 
dozen oysters and a wine-glass of wine. This is nice. 

GUMBO SOUP. 

Make as ochra soup ; and when the meat is boiled in 
shreds, strain, and thicken with pulverized sassafras 
leaves, about two tea-spoonfuls ; after the oysters are 
put in, take off the fire, and add the powder, and stir 
in till it ropes, without being too thick ; eat with rice. 
The sassafras leaves should be gathered when tender, 
and dried in the shade ; then pulverize and bottle. 

, EEL, OR FISH SOUP. 

Take four pounds of small eels, (having previously 
cleaned them ;) boil in four quarts of water ; add two 
carrots, one onion, parsley, celery, allspice, cloves, Cay- 
enne pepper, and salt ; when the vegetables are done, 
thicken with a little flour ; add a cup of sweet cream, 
or, if preferred, add one glass of Avine, or catsup. Any 
kind of hard fish may be made in this manner, but will 
require a little butter. Good fast-day soup. 

BRO^WN SOUP. 

This is generally made of beef Boil till tender, then 
some onions, either roasted, brown, or fried, carrots. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 69 

parsley, celery, sweet herbs, cloves, allspice, pepper, 
salt, and some rice ; when the meat is boiled to shreds, 
strain on toasted bread; add to this, if desired, port 
wine, or currant-jelly. 

BEAM" SOUP. 
Clean and wash the beans over night, then ponrboil- 
inff water on them, and let them remain till morning ; 
then take out of the water, and put over the fire, with 
plenty of water ; wash clean a small piece ol corned 
beef, about half as much pork, and throw m; cover 
ti^ht,not forgetting to skim carefully; then put m one 
carrot, sliced, parsley, celery, and pepper ; boil slowly, 
till done; strain on toasted bread. Pea soup or dry 
corn may be made in the same way. 

EGGS. 

TO CHOOSE EGGS. 
A very ffood method of choosing eggs is to drop 
them in cold water, and if they sink readily, they are 
^ood; if not, throw them away. Another way is to 
hold them to the light ; if clear, they are fresh, if not, 
they are not good. 

FOR PBESERVING EGGS. 

They may be greased, so as to stop up the pores, 

and packed in a box of bran, or oats, small end down. 

The easiest and best way that I have kept them, is to 

take them, when fresh, and put them m a tub, with a 

layer of salt at the bottom, small end downward ; then 

a layer of salt, and a layer of eggs, until your jar, or 

tub, is filled. A cracked one will spoil the whoLe, or a 

bad one. They must be kept in a cool place, ihis is 

the most acceptable way of keeping theni that I have 

ever tried. Another method is good to keep them, it 

rightly done. Pour a gallon of boiling water on two 

quarts of quicklime, and half a pound of salt; when 

cold, stir into it an omice of cream oi tartar, part ot 

the lime will remain at the bottom. Put m the eggs, 

small end downward, and they will keep for a long time. 



*20 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

BOILING EGGS. 

Put into boiling water, and boil three minutes, or 
j^ut into cold water, and let them remain five minutes ; 
then turn off the water, and pour on more, and let 
them remain five minutes longer, without boiling. For 
salad, or to garnish a dish, boil eight minutes. A nice 
way to cook them is to drop them into boiling water, 
and let them remain a moment, to prevent their stick- 
ing, then set on the stove until the white is set ; then 
take up with a spoon, and lay on buttered toast. 

SOKAMBLED EGGS. 

Warm a little butter in a pan ; then beat up eggs 
light, and pour it in ; stir until thick, and turn on a hot 
dish, without allowing any to stick. 

TO EKY EGGS. 

Eggs are usually fried after frying ham. If there is 
not gravy enough, add a little lard. Break one in a 
saucer, at a time, and drop in ; then take a spoon and 
turn the hot fat over, until the white is nicely set, with- 
out turning over, as they look much nicer. Lay on the 
ham, if you like, but a nicer way is to put them on a 
plate by themselves. 

OMELETTE. 

Take half a dozen eggs, and beat to a froth, strain 
through a sieve, if you like ; then resume the beating 
until light ; put in the frying-pan a piece of butter, 
pour in the eggs, and, as soon as firm, put a plate over, 
and turn the pan bottom side up ; fold the omelette to- 
gether, and serve hot. From five to ten minutes will 
cook it. 

BREAD OMELETTE. 

Put a handful of bread-crumbs in a sauce-pan, a little 
cream, salt, and pepper, nutmeg if you like ; when the 
bread has absorbed all the bread, pour in eight eggs 
well beaten, and fry like an omelette. Another me- 
thod is to use chopped ham or beef, instead of bread- 
crumbs, and fry as above. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 71 

OMELETTE. 

Mix a large spoonful of flour smooth, and add a cup 
of milk, add a large spoonful of butter, a tea-spoonful 
of salt, and six eggs, the white and yolks beaten sepa- 
rately ; heat a little butter in a pan, and turn in until 
cooked, then take it up as directed. It should be fried 
in a small spider, so that the omelette should be an 
inch thick. 

A SWEET OMELETTE. • 

Beat up four eggs, add a little salt and sugar, and 
fry in butter ; make a half a pound of preserve liquid, 
by shaking it over the fire ; spread half of it on the 
omelette ; double up like a turnover, and pour the rest 
on the top. 

CUPPED EGGS. 

Put a spoonful of highly seasoned gravy, or butter, 
in tea-cups, set the cups in boiling water, and when 
the gravy heats, drop a fresh egg into each one, and 
take off the stove, and cover the pan tight, until nicely 
cooked ; dredge with nutmeg, and salt. Serve in a hot- 
water plate, covered with a napkin. 

TO POACH EGGS IJST A CUP. 

Put a little butter, or drippings, in a spider ; break 
the eggs gently into cups of diflerent sizes ; with a 
slight turn of the hand, turn the cup with the egg into 
the pan, until all are turned over ; have a very slow 
fire ; raise the cups a little to ascertain when done. 
Serve with toasted bread, or spinage. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Break fresh eggs into boiling water, and let them 
stand on the stove till the white is set, then take up 
carefully ; trim the edges nicely, and send to the table 
hot. 

EGGS DONE "WITH CHEESE. 

Put some butter in a spider, cover it with bread- 
crumbs ; on that, lay slices of cheese ; then beat eggs 
light ; season with pepper and salt ; cover tight till 
the eggs are done, then take up. 



^2 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

EGG OMELETTE. 

Take one spoonful of flour, wet it with one of milk, 
a small piece of butter, to one egg ; fry till done. 

BAKED EGGS. 

Melt some butter in a patty-pan ; break in your eggs ; 
add a little salt and pepper ; bake till the whites are 
done, then serve with toast. 

CEUPS BROUILLES. 

Put a little butter in a saucepan ; sprinkle over it 
some salt ; add a little gravy, which makes the eggs 
softer ; stir them over the fire until thick. Serve with 
toasted bread. Ham, mushroom, etc., are nice minced 
and added. The difference between this and an ome- 
lette is, that an omelette is more compact, and turns 

out smooth. 

SOUFFLE FBANCAIS. 

Put into a stewpan an ounce of butter ; stir in two 
spoonfuls of flour, and cook well, but not colored; 
add by degrees a wine-glass of boiling cream and four 
of milk ; stir smooth, and take off the fire ; add the 
yolks of four eggs, a little sugar, and a table-spoonful 
of orange- water ; whip up lightly the white of eight 
eggs, and mix with the batter; put the whole in a 
souffle-dish, and bake an hour. 

FISH. 

Fish should be well cleaned, and cooked while 
fresh. If the least tainted, they should be thrown 
away. Fresh fish are better soaked in salt and water 
a few hours before cooking. In boiling, they should 
be rolled in a cloth, and put in cold water, with salt 
thrown in the water. A very little boiling will an- 
swer ; if over-boiled, they will be watery and unpala- 
table. Salt fish should be soaked over night, or long- 
er, if not fresh enough. Buttermilk is the best to 
soak them in, but they require longer soaking ; then 
wash clean before cooking. Fish should always be 
eaten as soon as cooked. For a garnish, use parsley, 
hard-boiled eggs, or lemons cut in slices. Always fry 



AND housekeeper's AID. 73 

pork first, and then fry the fish in the gravy, if you 
can. Most all cook-books recommend lard instead of 
butter, but I prefer butter, if you are careful not to 
burn it, as it will make the fish look bad. After fry- 
ing fish a gravy may be made by stirring in a little 
flour and water, with butter, if you like, wine or cat- 
sup ; turn on the fish. For boiled fish, always make 
a sauce, as directed for fish. For baked fish, use a 
dressing of bread, soaked soft ; then mix butter, salt, 
pepper and spices, if you can. An egg or two will 
make the dressing cut smooth. Wash the fish per- 
fectly clean ; fill with the dressing, and sew up ; put 
in a dripping-pan, with a little water, a slice or two of 
pork. Bake from half an hour to an hour. 

HALIBUT 

is nice cut in slices and dipped in Indian meal ; pep- 
pered and salted ; then fried, or it may be broiled. 
The dried is nice for tea, or soaked in cold water a 
ittle while, and broiled. 

CODFISH. 

Fresh cod is good cooked almost in any way, ex- 
cept broiled. Salt codfish may be cut in small pieces, 
and soaked in cold water, putting it where it will 
warm, about half an hour ; take out and put in milk 
and a piece of butter — or cream is the best ; stir in a 
little flour, made smooth, but do not let it boil— only 
simmer — boiling will harden it. It will cook in fif- 
teen minutes. A few eggs will improve it. Pour on 
buttered toast. It may be laid on a few coals till 
brown; then soak in cold water a few minutes to 
soften. 

BUTTEKED CODFISH. 

Shred it fine, and soak in cold water until fresh 
enough;. then drain and put in a piece of butter the 
size of an egg, with a spoonful of flour ; stir a few 
minutes ; then lay on the platter, and sprinkle pepper 
over it. Eat hot.

BAKED SHAD. 

Make a stuffing of the head and cold boiled ham; 
season with salt, pepper, cloves and sweet herbs ; 
moisten with an egg ; stuff the fish and rub some on 
the outside ; put it in a deep pan, with its tail toward 
its mouth ; pour on water and a piece of butter ; bake 
two hours ; make a gravy and pour around it, and 
garnish with lemons sliced. 

TO BOIL CODFISH. 

Soak two or three hours in cold wsiter ; or a better 
way is to soak it over night, if wanted for dinner ; 
then put in a pot, Avith cold water on it, and let it 
cook slowly, but not boil, for two hours. Serve with 
potatoes, and make a gravy of drawn butter, or egg 
sauce. If you prefer, it may be chopped up together, 
the fish and potatoes. Vinegar added to the sauce is 
nice. Another method is to mash the potatoes and 
fish together, adding cream, or milk and butter, with 
pepper, and make in round flat cake, an inch thick, 
and fry in butter, having previously dipped them in 
flour, or egg and flour. These are nice fried for tea. 

BKOILED CODFISH. 

Sprinkle salt and pepper on the outside and inside ; 
let it remain six or seven hours, before broiling or 
frying ; split, and dry in a cloth ; grease the gridiron, 
and put the fish on outside uppermost, and broil a 
quarter of an hour ; be careful not to burn it ; butter 
well, and send to the table hot. Fried shad must be 
rolled in Indian meal or flour, or rubbed over with 
egg and bread-crumbs, before frying. 

TO BOIL FKESH SALMON". 

Salmon requires more cooking than most any other 
kind of fish ; scald and clean nice ; put in a kettle of 
cold water, with a handful of salt ; let it boil slowly, 
allowing a quarter of an hour to a pound of fish. As 
soon as done, take carefully up in a napkin, and wrap 
it close, to absorb the moisture ; lay on a hot dish, 
and garnish with horse-radish and curled parsley, or 
boiled eggs, cut in rings, laid round the dish. Oyster 



AND HOTTSEKEEPEr's AID. 15 

sauce is best Avith fresh boiled iisli. For broiling, cut 
in thin slices. 

SMOKED SALMON". 

Scale and cut the fish up the back ; take out the roe 
and the bone ; rub inside and out with equal parts of 
sugar and salt ; add a little saltpetre ; press flat with 
a board and weights on it two days ; drain from the 
salt, and wipe dry ; stretch it open, and fasten with a 
stick ; hang up and smoke four or five days ; when 
used, soak in warm water, and broil. 

SOUNDS AWD TONGUES. 

Soak in lukewarm water three or four hours ; then 
scrape off the skin, cut in two, and stew in milk ; stir 
in a little butter and flour just before taking up. 
Another way is, to dip in egg, and then in flour, and 
fry in buttter. Use drawn-butter gravy. 

TO BOIL ERESH CODFISH. 

Put into water boiling hot, and boil twenty minutes, 
or according to the size of the fish. Use oyster sauce 
for gravy. 

TO COOK EELS. 

Skin, and wash clean ; cut in small pieces two inches 
long ; put in cold water, or milk and water, with a 
handful of salt, and boil until a fork will go in easy ; 
then take up, and dip in flour, and fry in butter or 
lard a nice brown. Catfish are cooked in the same 
way, and are not good unless parboiled first. 

STEWTED EELS 

must be parboiled and cooked with a very little gravy, 
and butter, if you have not the gravy. Put in a couple 
of spoonfuls of water, pepper, and salt. Just before 
taking up, stir in a little flour made smooth. 

BLACK FISH. 

They must be boiled or fried, as directed for other 
fish. 

MACKESEL. 

If salt, soak over night in cold water ; then boil the 
next day. They will not require much cooking. If 



V6 EXCELSIOK COOK BOOK 

for frying or broiling, they must be soaked twenty- 
four hours at least, and in warm weather should be 
he])t in buttermilk, and w^hen required for broiling, 
should be rinsed and drained an hour or two before 
broiled. Salt shad may be soaked in the same way, 
only require longer soaking, as they are much thicker. 

TO COOK FRESH FISH. 

Have the fat hot, and, mth a pastry-brush, rub egg 
over the fish, and sprinkle bread-crumbs on, or else 
dip them in flour or Indian meal. Allow them to 
cook well on one side before turning. 

STURGEON STEAKS. 

Take off the skin, and cut slices half an inch thick ; 
rub with salt and the beaten yolk of an egg ; sprinkle 
on bread-crumbs ; wrap up in butter papers and broil ; 
take the papers off before sending to the table ; or 
broil without the egg, just salt rubbed on, and season 
with butter and Cayenne pepper. 

STURGEONS BAKED OR FRIED. 

They are good baked or broiled, but better fried. 
It should be boiled fifteen minutes previous to baking, 
to extract the oily taste which they are liable to have. 
The part next the tail is best. Bake as other fish. To 
fry, cut in slices nearly an inch thick, and fry where 
pork has been fried ; when brown, take up, and stir in 
a little flour, with pepper, salt, catsup, butter, and 
wine, if liked ; put back in the pot, and stew a few 
minutes. While cooking, make force-meat balls out 
of some fish reserved ; fry, and use them as a garnish 
for the fish. 

FISH FORCE-MEAT BALLS. 

Chop some of the uncooked fish with salt pork; 
mix two raw eggs, some bread-crumbs, and season 
w^ith pepper and spice, if you like ; do up in balls, 
and fry brown. 

TROUT. 

These are very fine fried, dipj^ed in flour or egg and 
bread-crumbs. They should be cooked with the head 
on, merely cut open and washed clean. They are good 



AND IIOUSEREEPER'S AID. 77 

Stewed with ca very little water and salt pork; or they 
may be broiled, or put in a cloth and boiled, using a 
fish sauce. ^.^^„ 

FISH CAKES. 
Take salt pork and chop with fresh fish that has 
been previously cooked ; mix with eggs and bread- 
crumbs ; season with pepper and salt; then make iip 
into small cakes, and fry brown. Flour the hands 
Avhile making them. The fat must be hot. 

SCOLLOPS. 

Boil them, and take out of the shells ; take out the 
heart, and throw the rest away, as that is the only 
part fit to eat; dip in flour, and fry brown. Ihey 
may also be stcAved with a little water, seasoned with 
pepper and salt. 

TO CKIMP FBESH FISH. 

Cut in slices and put in water, vinegar, and salt, 
three hours ; then fry or broil them. 

LOBSTEBS AND CBABS. 

Put them in boiling water with a handful of salt. 
Boil half an hour or more, in proportion to its size. 
It must not be boiled too long or it will be hard. 
When done, take out and wipe dry ; then take oli the 
shell and take out the blue veins and the lady-fingers, 
as they are unwholesome. Send to the table cold with 
the body and tail split open and the claws taken off. 
Lay the claws next the body, the small ones outside ; 
garnish with parsley. They must never be cooked 
after they are dead, but put alive into boiling water. 
TO DBESS LOBSTEBS COLD. 

Take the fish out of the shell, divide it in small 
pieces, mash up the scarlet meat, then mix mustai-d, 
Cayenne pepper, salt, vinegar, sweet oil, and mix the 
lobster with this mixture and serve m a dish. 

CLAMS. 

Wash them clean and put in a pot Avith water enough 
to prevent their burning, and boil until the shells open, 
then take out and remove the shells. Cook m the 



78 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

same water, adding pepper and butter. Stir in rolled 
crackers, or toast slices of bread and lay in a tureen, 
and pour the clams over. Long clams are nice taken 
out of the shells and broiled. 

CLAM PAWCAKES. 

Make a batter of milk, flour and eggs, and if small, 
stew the clams and put in whole ; if large, chop them 
without stewing ; season with pepper and salt, and 
fry on a griddle. Oysters may be made in the same 
way, only not cooked nor chopped. Part of the oys- 
ter-juice may be added to the milk. They are nice 
kept frozen in the winter-time and used when wanted ;, 
freezing makes them more tender. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Take those that are large, wipe with a napkin, and 
then dip in beaten eggs, then in bread-crumbs or flour, 
and fry in lard or butter. They are nice dipped in a 
batter and fried. They can be kept several montha 
by frying while fresh, seasoned with salt and pepper, 
then corked tight in a bottle. When eaten, warm in 
a little water. They are nice to garnish fish. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Stew oysters with cloves, nutmeg, yolks of hard- 
boiled eggs, a little butter, liquor enough to cover 
them ; Avhen stewed a few moments take out to cool. 
Have shells of pufF-paste baked in patty-pans, and 
three or four oysters in each. 

STEWED OYSTERS. NO. 1. 

Rinse off the oysters and strain the liquor to get 
off the bits of shell that adhere to the oyster. Heat 
the liquor and add water, if not enough ; then turn in 
the oysters ; stir in a little flour made smooth or rolled 
crackers. Let them boil up two minutes and j^our 
out. No salt should be added until taken out, or they 
Avill shrink and be hard. Eat with crackers or but- 
tered toast. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Line a deep plate with pastry, fill it with pieces of 
bread, cover with nice pastry, and bake of a light

brown Have the oysters stewed and seasoned just as 
the pakry is baked. Take off the upper crust, remove 
the bread, and put in the oysters; cove^'/^l.tlij ^ 
crust and serve while hot. Another way is to Une the 
dish with pastry and put in the oysters, and cover with 
pastry, and bake from half an hour to three quarters. 

SCOLLOPED OYSTEKS. 

Pound crackers or rusk fine. Then butter small 
tin pans and put in alternate layers of oysters and 
crumbs, having a layer of cmmbs on top ; season with 
butter, salt, aifd pepper ; add oyster-juice to moisten 
the whole. Bake until brown. 

TO PICKLE OYSTERS. 
Take them out of their liquor and pour boiling 
water on them ; then take them out and put m a kettle 
with iust water enough to cover them, with a large 
Tpoonful of salt to a hundred oysters ; let boil up and 
take out, then spread on a board and cover with a 
cloth. With every pint of the liquor add a quart ot 
o-ood vinegar, a tea-spoonful of mace, a table-spoonful 
of whole cloves, the same of black pepper. Heat the 
whole together, and when it boils stir m the oysters 
five minuses. Let them cool and then put m jars and 

'^Another way, is to scald the oysters in their own 
liquor. Take vinegar and heat scaldmg hot, with 
whole cloves and pepper-corns, also mace When the 
oysters and .vinegar are lukewarm, mix them, ihen 
bottle them and cover tight. 

SOUSED MACKEREL, 

Clean, and boil in salt and water; take equal quan- 

titles of vinegar and water that they were boiled m. 

Heat scalding hot with cloves and pepper-corns, then 

turn on the fi^sh. They will be eatable in two or three 

^^^^' STEWED OYSTERS. 

Strain all the liquor from the oysters ; thicken a very 
little with bread-crumbs or crackers ; season with pep- 
per and butter. Have ready a tureen with eithei 



80 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

toasted bread or crackers laid in the bottom ; place 
the oyster on top, and when the liquor boils up, pour 
it over the oysters, then cover the tureen and let it 
remain five or six minutes before sending to the table. 
Cooking oysters in this way wall prevent their shrink- 
ing. The butter, when put in, may be rolled in flour 
if liked. 

PICKLED LOBSTEES. 

Boil them in the usual manner, and after taking out 
of the shells, cut into pieces three inches long. Take 
vinegar, salt, cloves, allspice and pepper-corns, and 
boil ten minutes ; then put in the lobster and scald up. 
Put in a jar and keep in a cool place. 

TO PICKLE SHAD OK PIKE. 

Have them well cleaned, then make a j^ickle by 
mixing half a pound of brown sugar, four quarts of 
rock salt, one of common salt, and two ounces of salt- 
petre. This quantity will pickle a dozen shad or fif- 
teen pike. Put a layer of the mixture at the bottom 
of a keg, then a layer of fish with the skin-side dow^n. 
Continue this until full, having the salt mixture on 
top. Have a heavy weight on to keep them under the 
brine. 

PICKLED SALMON. 

Salmon .should be cut into a number of pieces and 
boiled in salt and water until sufiiciently cooked to 
eat. Take three quarts of vinegar, an ounce of pep- 
per-corns, allspice whole, scald together, and when 
strongly spiced take from the fire, and when cold, 
pour on the salmon. 

PICKLED TKOUT. 

If large cut in pieces, boil with salt and water. Put 
in cold vinegar with whole cloves, allspice and pepper- 
corns, between each layer of fish. Keep in a stone 
jar in a cool place. They should be wrapped in a 
cloth or they will boil to pieces. These are excellent. 

SPICED OYSTERS. 

Take one hundred large fresh oysters, put them with 
the liquor into a large earthen vessel ; add two table- 



AND housekeeper's AID. 81 

spoonfuls of good vinegar, a dozen cloves, one nutmeg 
grated, a few blades of mace whole, one tea-sj^oonful of 
salt, one of whole allspice, and a little Cayenne pepper ; 
stir well together and set them over a slow fire, keep- 
ing them well covered. Take them off occasionally 
and stir well from the bottom, to prevent their burning. 
As soon as they boil they are done. Pour them out 
into a pan to cool. When cool, they will be fit for eat- 
ing. If to be kept any time, should have less spice, as 
they will taste too much of it. 

TO KEEP OYSTERS IK THE SHELL. 

Lay them in a heap in the cellar with the concave 
side upward to hold in the liquor. SjDrinkle them 
every day with salt and water, and then with Indian 
meal. Cover with an old carpet. 

STEWED OYSTERS. NO. 2. 

Strain the liquor, and add a glass of white wine, 
some crumbs of stale bread and pepper. Put in the 
oysters and let them stew a few minutes. Have ready 
some toasted bread well buttered, then dip the toast in 
the liquor and lay around the sides and bottom of a 
dish. Pour the oysters on and send to the table hot. 

BROILED FISH. 

Rub a little salt on the bars of the gridiron to jire- 
vent its sticking ; have a clear fire ; score your fish and 
cook slowly ; when done on one side, turn over and 
cook on the other. Season with salt, pepper, and 
melted butter. 

HADDOCK. 

Clean well and rub dry ; then rub salt over it and 
let it hang two days ; skin and rub beaten egg over, 
and crumbs of bread. Fry, broil, or bake. 

POTTED FISH. 

After being well cleaned cut in small pieces ; soak in 
salt and vinegar for a few hours and drain it. Lay in a 
stone jar with spices and pieces of butter till all is in. 
Pour over good cider vinegar, a little Cayenne pepper. 
Cover with a crust of dough ; put in a very moderate 



82 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

oven, or in an oven after bread has been taken out. 
Take oiF the crust and cover tight. Any kind of fresh, 
firm fish will answer. 

OYSTEK SOUP. NO. 2. 

Put a nicely dressed chicken in a kettle with four 
quarts of water ; season with pepper-corns, allspice, 
four blades of mace, nutmeg and salt; roll half a pound 
of butter in flour and put in. KeejD well covered till 
the chicken is tender ; then put in the oyster-liquor and 
boil five minutes ; take up the chicken and strain the 
liquor, and pour back into the kettle, and add three 
pints of oysters ; boil up once and serve. Dress the 
chicken separately or make chicken salad. 

BAKED EELS. 

Take eels that have been skinned and cleaned, cut in 
pieces ; then lay in a shallow pan, setting the pieces 
upright ; season with pepper, salt, sweet herbs, parsley 
cut small, and a little water. Bake till done, then stir 
in some flour made smooth, and serve. They should 
be jDreviously boiled. 

VEGETABLES. 

POTATOES. 

Almost every person understands cooking potatoes, 
nevertheless it will not be amiss to give a few hints in 
regard to cooking this vegetable, which has become 
almost the " staff of life." In the first place, care should 
be taken to procure the best kind; but as potatoes 
change so much, (in consequence of the rot,) I can not 
mention which w^ould be the best — one must be guid- 
ed by circumstances. In winter they should be kept 
w^here they will not freeze, and in summer in a dry 
place, and the sprouts should be broken off occasionally. 
Always have the water boiling hot when the potatoes 
are dropped in. If boiled with the skins on, they will 
be strong, except when new; give old ones an hour to 
boil, new ones half an hour. Potatoes are nice baked, 
but require a slow oven. Boiled and mashed, wdth 
cream or butter enough to moisten, with a little salt, is 



AND HOrSEKEEPER'S AID. 83 

the best and most common way of cooking ; then put 
them in a dish, smooth the top with a knife, and lay- 
butter on in spots ; sprinkle a little pepper over and 
send to the table hot. Cold ones may be warmed 
diflerent ways : cut in thin slices and warmed in cream 
is nice. Another way is to slice and broil on a grid- 
iron, or fry in butter, sj^rinkling salt and pepper over 
them. They can be grated and mixed with the yolk of 
egg and fried in butter, after being made in small 

O *1 K P ^ 

SA^EET POTATOES. 

The best way to cook sweet potatoes is to bake them ; 
for a change, they can be boiled and peeled as other 
potatoes, or half-boiled and sliced and fried in butter. 

TUKNIPS. 

The large English sweet turnip is the best, as they 
are not watery. Pare them and slice, then drop them 
in a kettle of boiling water and let them boil as long 
as potatoes ; when done, drain off the water and mash 
w^ith salt ; put in a dish and smooth the top with a 
knife ; put on pieces of butter and sprinkle on pepper ; 
send to the table hot. If cooked with salt meat, cut in 
quarters and send to the table whole. 

RUTA BAGA 

is large and of a reddish color. Pare them and quarter, 

or cut in slices and let them remain in cold water an 

hour or so ; then boil two hours ; mash like other 

turnips. 

onflows. 

They should be put in a linen bag and kept in a dry 
cool place ; when boiled they should be put in milk and 
water to take away the strong taste ; an hour is requir- 
ed for boiling, but it is well to try them with a fork, 
for if boiled too much they will be watery. When 
taken up, the water should be pressed out, and seasoned 
with butter, salt, and pepper; it is well to throw a 
handful of salt in while boiling. Another way of cook- 
ing is to pare and slice them, then fry in pork gravy or 
butter ; season well with salt and pepper ; while cooking 



84 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

it is well to put in a little water. This is nice for a 
breakfast dish. They can also be baked and then 
seasoned. 

\^7■IK"TER SQUASH. 

They should be kept in a dry warm place during the 
winter and will kee23 until spring. Pare them and cut 
out the inside ; cut in strips and boil half an hour ; 
when done, season as turnips and send to the table hot. 
They are better baked. 

SUMMEB SQUASH. 

Cut off the top and end, and quarter ; boil half an 
hour and then put them in a strainer and press out the 
water, then turn in a j)an and season with butter and 
salt. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Cut before they grow so as to be tough ; cut up in 
small pieces, wash and turn on water ; boil until tender, 
(they must be cooked in tin,) then take a little flour 
with cream and salt, stir in, and when hot take off and 
send to the table hot. Another way is to tie the stalks 
together, heads one way, lay them in boiling water, 
with salt, until tender ; toast bread and moisten with 
water, lay on a dish, then drain the asparagus aud lay 
the heads inward, spread on the toast and pour over it 
melted butter. 

CAULIFLOWEK. 

Cut off the flower and soak in cold water awhile, 
then tie in a cloth and drop in boiling water, or milk 
and water ; skim well while boiling ; when tender, 
which will be in an hour, take up and drain ; send to 
the table with melted butter. This is nice pickled as 
cabbage. 

CABBAGE. 

This vegetable should be buried in drills during the 
winter season, and as a head is wanted it can be taken 
out, without disturbing the rest, and will be as fresh 
as in the fall. If put in the cellar, they will wilt. 
When used, they should be carefully examined, and 
placed in salt and water a few minutes, to draAV any 
worms that mi^ht be in the leaves, Boil an hour with 



AND housekeeper's AID. 85 

salt meat, either pork or beef, tlien drain and chop 
fine, (which can be done with a knife,) put in a piece 
of butter, and sprinkle pepper over the top ; eat with 
vinegar. Another way is to cut fine, with a knife 
made on purpose, then put in a basin with a very little 
water, just enough to keep from burning on the basin ; 
after cooking about ten minutes, wet a table-spoonful 
of flour with thick cream, add a little salt, stir in while 
boiling, then pour in vinegar, and take ofi"; eat while 
hot ; or you may leave out the vinegar if you like. 
Another method is to chop fine and turn in vinegar, 
with a piece of butter and salt ; cook ten minutes, and 
eat hot ; or turn on vinegar and salt, and eat cold with- 
out warming. Some prefer it in this way. 

BEETS. 

The young beets, when thinned out in summer, are 
nice for greens ; take tops and all ; when grown large 
enough to cook, wash clean with a cloth, but be careful 
not to break the skin, (or they will lose their flavor 
while cooking ;) boil from two to three hours ; when 
kept longer they require more time ; when tender, take 
up and drop into a pan of cold water a moment, when 
the skin can easily be taken off"; then slice them thin 
and sprinkle on pepper and salt, wdth melted butter 
and vinegar. They are nice cut lengthwise, and drop- 
ped in spiced vinegar until pickled. They are better 
baked and eaten like potatoes. 

PARSlSriPS. 

Parsnips may be scraped and boiled tender ; then 
mashed in a stewpan with a little cream and butter, 
also, salt, and sprinkle pepper on top. They may be 
cut lengthwise, and cooked with a few slices of j^ork, 
Avith just water enough to cook tender. 

CARROTS. 

Half-boil, then take off* the skin, and slice in a stew- 
pan. Put in a piece of butter, a tea-cupful of water, 
half a cupful of cream, pepper and salt ; then simmer 
until tender, but not broken ; wet up a little flour, and 



86 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

Stir carefully in just before taking up. Another way to 
cook them is to boil with salt meat. 

MUSHKOOMS. 

A person should be acquainted with the different 
sorts of vegetables by this name, as many persons have 
been poisoned by using the wrong kind. The eatable 
kmd appears very small, of a round form, on a little 
stalk. They grow very fast, and the upper part and 
stalk are Avhite. As they grow, the under part opens, 
and is of a fringy fur, of a fine salmon color ; and as 
the mushroom grows turns to a dark brown. The skin 
can be easily parted from the edges and middle. Those 
that have white or yellow fur should be avoided. 

TO STE^W MUSHROOMS. 

The large buttons are best, and small flaps while the 
fur is still red. Rub the large buttons with salt and a 
flannel ; cut out the fur and take off the skin from the 
others ; sprinkle with salt and put into a stewpan with 
some pepper-corns ; simmer slowly until done, then piit 
in a piece of butter wdth flour and a little cream, and 
take up. 

TO STE^W CUCUMBERS. 

Slice them quite thick, strew with a little salt and 
pepper, with a little butter, and simmer slowly until 
tender, then add a little flour wet with w^ater ; onions 
are nice fried with them. Another way is to slice the 
onions and cucumbers, and flour nicely; then fry in 
butter, and when browned on one side, turn over and 
fry on the other. 

TO STEW CELERY. 

Strip off the outer leaves and wash clean ; halve or 
leave whole, according to their size, cut in lengths ot 
about three inches ; stew until tender, with a little 
butter and water ; then add a little cream, and flour 
seasoned with salt, nutmeg and pepper, simmer together. 

VEGETABLE OYSTERS, OR SALSIFY. 

This plant grows like parsnips, and when cooked, 
has the taste of the oyster. They should be scraped 
and sliced thin, then boil in water until tender, when 



AND housekeeper's AID. 87 

season with pepper, salt, and stir in a little flour, after 
wetting in a little cold water, a large piece of butter ; 
toast some bread and lay in a deep dish, then turn on, 
and eat as you would oysters. Some prefer adding a 
little milk to the water when boiling. The root may 
be partly boiled, and then chopped and made in balls, 
then floured and fried in butter, or dipped in batter. 

SPIKTACH. 

Pick clean, and wash ; drain and put in boiling 
water, removing the scum as it rises. When tender, 
drain, and press it well ; chop it fine, then put in a 
saucepan with a piece of butter, pepper, and salt ; let 
it stew a few minutes, stirring all the time. It requires 
ten minutes to boil. 

EGG- PL AWT. 

The purple is better than the white ; they must be 
boiled in plenty of water until tender, then take up, 
and take ofi* the skins, and drain ; cut them up and 
wash in a deep dish or pan ; mix some grated bread, 
powdered sweet marjoram, a piece of butter, and a few 
pounded cloves ; grate a layer of bread over the top, 
and brown in the oven ; send to the table in the same 
dish. It is generally eaten at breakfast. If you fry 
them, slice without paring, about half an inch thick, 
and let them remain in cold water an hour or two, 
throw a little salt in to take away the strong taste ; 
when taken out, wipe dry, and season with pepper 
and salt ; beat the yolk of egg, and grate some bread- 
crumbs ; have ready, in a frying-pan, some lard and 
butter hot ; dip the plant in the egg, then in the 
crumbs, and fry brown; taking care to have them 
done through ; otherwise they will be unpalatable. 

PEAS. 

They should be cooked as soon as shelled, or they 
will lose their flavor ; have the water boiling, and 
only just enough to cook them ; season with salt, pep- 
per, and butter, or sweet cream ; they will cook from 
a half-hour to an hour, according to age. Another 
method : place several leaves of lettuce in your sauce- 



88 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

pan, then put in your peas, with an ounce of butter to 
two quarts of peas ; cover close, and place over the 
fire. In thirty minutes they will be clone ; season with 
pepper and salt. Another way is to take one quart of 
peas, one onion sliced, a head of lettuce, washed clean, 
a piece of butter, pep23er, salt, and no more water than 
hangs round the lettuce from washing ; stew them two 
hours very , gently ; when done, beat up an egg and 
stir in, or a spoonful of flour and butter. 

SAVEET COKN. 

Is very nice boiled on the cob, and is the common 
method of cooking it; a handful of salt should be 
thrown in while boiling. It is sweeter to let part of 
the husk remain on until boiled. 

SUCCOTASH. 

Cut the corn from the cob, and boil with new shelled 
beans ; it will require half an hour or more ; season 
with butter or sweet cream, pepper, and salt. 

CABBAGE SALAD. 

Chop one head of cabbage in a chopping-bowl ; 
then put in a pan or basin ; turn on cold water with 
two table-spoonfuls of salt and let it remain two hours ; 
then drain, and pour on the following mixture : Beat 
four eggs to a froth with a pint of good cider vinegar, 
and place over the fire until thick and scalding hot ; be 
careful to stir all the time ; take from the fire before it 
boils, and add a large spoonful of mixed mustard, two 
tea-spoonfuls of black pepper, a little salt, say two tea- 
spoonfuls, half a cup of melted butter or salad oil ; it 
must not be mixed with the cabbage until cold. It 
will keep several weeks if kept in a cool place. Cream 
used in the place of butter is good for immediate use. 

SLAW. 

Melt in a sauce-pan a piece of butter or beef-drip- 
pings the size of a hen's egg ; when hot, put in the 
cabbage, (having previously cut it in strips,) and stir it 
Avith an iron spoon until tender, which will be in about 
twenty minutes ; season with salt and pepper, also a 
cup of vinegar ; then take up. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 89 

GREENS. 

Cowslips, dandelions, mustard, water-cresses, spin- 
ach, pig-weed, milk-weed, and young beets, tops and 
all, are nice for greens ; they should, be well looked 
over, and washed before using ; put in clean water 
and boil fifteen minutes, then drain, and boil with salt 
meat, either pork or beef, until tender. A mixture of 
greens are better than all one kind ; young nettles are 
nice, also plantain put in with other greens. 

HOMINY. 

Wash in cold water, and boil five hours with a quart 
of water to a pint of hominy ; turn off all the water 
and add butter and salt, or the water may be dried 
off, as for rice. 

FRENCH OR STRING BEANS. 

Take off the strings and cut in pieces half an inch 
long ; boil Avith a little saleratus, which not only pre- 
serves the green color, but makes them more digest- 
ible ; say a quarter of a tea-spoonful to half a peck of 
beans ; if young, they will boil in half an hour ; butter 
after taking out of the liquor ; salt should be added 
while boiling. A better way is to cook without salera- 
tus, with just water enough to cook them tender, and 
just before taking them up, put in a tea-cupful of sweet 
cream, a piece of butter, pepper, and salt. 

BAKED BEANS. 

The small white beans are best for baking ; they 
should be picked over and washed clean ; then turn 
on cold water, and let them remain all night ; in the 
morning take them out, and put in a kettle with 
water, also a piece of pork, and boil until nearly ten- 
der, adding a little saleratus to render them healthy ; 
then take out and gash the pork, and place in a pan 
• with only the rind seen ; bake two hours in an oven; 
pepper should be sprinkled on the top, and if the pork 
is not sufficient to make them salt, add more before 
baking ; some put in a few spoonfuls of molasses 
before baking. 



90 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

OCHRA. 

Take an equal quantity of young tender ochra, 
chopped fine, and ripe tomatoes, two onions sliced, and 
a small lump of butter ; stew with a large spoonful of 
water ; season with pej^per and salt. 

MACAKONI. 

Take two oimces of macaroni, one pint of water, 
and one of milk, add a tea-spoonful of salt ; stew until 
tender, then cut in small pieces and butter it. 

LIMA BEANS. 

Wash and boil until tender, which will be about 
two hours ; season with salt, pep]3er, butter, or cream ; 
use only water sufficient. They may be kept through 
the winter by gathering them on a dry day, before 
they get hard, and packing them in a keg ; put salt at 
the bottom, then a layer of pods, then salt, and so on 
until full ; put a weight on and keep in a cool place ; 
when used, soak over night in cold water, shell the 
next day, and soak until ready to boil ; they may be 
shelled and dried as other beans and then soaked be- 
fore using. 

DKY GREElSr CORN". 

Gather when ready to boil ; strip off the husks, and 
drop into boiling water ; let the water boil over the 
ears ; then take out and shell off the corn by running 
the prong of a fork through. This method is the best 
as it saves the kernel Avhole, and is easily done ; spread 
on clean boards, and dry quickly, as it is apt to sour 
if not. When cooked, soak over night, and boil in 
the same water the next morning ; it should be well 
washed before soaking ; season with butter, pepper, 
salt, and cream. This is a nice dish in the winter ; 
some prefer cutting it off the cobs before boiling, and 
drying in the oven, but I prefer the former metliod. 

ARTICHOKES 

are good cut in thin slices, with vinegar, pepper, and 
salt. When cooked they must be boiled until tender, 
keeping them closely covered ; serve with melted but- 
ter, in as many cups as artichokes. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 91 

TOMATOES. 

Take those that are fully ripe; turn on boiling 
water ; let them remain a few minutes, when the skins 
will easily peel oft*; then pnt in a stewpan with butter, 
pepper, salt, and sugar ; toast some bread and lay in a 
deep dish, pour on, or eat without the toast, with 
meat ; they should be cooked nntil soft, which will be 
in fifteen minntes ; it is much improved by turning off 
the water, and then seasoning; they are very nice 
cooked as follows. After taking oft" the skin, lay them 
in a deep dish, with alternate layers of bread-crumbs ; 
season each layer with salt, pepper, butter, and sugar, 
and add cloves if liked ; put a layer of bread-crumbs 
on top, and bake three quarters of an hour ; they are 
nice sliced up raw, with vinegar, salt, and pepper, on 
them, and some like sugar ; or they may be eaten with 
sugar and cream alone. 

SEA KALE. 

This is prepared on toast like asparagus. 

GREEN TOMATOES. 

Green tomatoes are nice sliced and fried in butter 
or beef-drippings, seasoned with pepper and salt, also 
sugar ; onions or green apples may be sliced up with 
them if liked. 

CELERIAC. 

This vegetable is very much like celery, but is but 
little known ; it is more easily cultivated. Scrape and 
cut in slices; boil until tender; then take out of the 
water, and stew a few minutes in milk, with a little 
salt ; add butter when dished up. The roots are good 
boiled tender, and put into soups or meat pies. 

ASPARAGUS. NO. 2. 

Beat four eggs light ; melt two ounces of butter, and 
add with pepper and salt, then pour over toasted bread ; 
have the asparagus well cooked, and pour^ over the 
whole. Serve hot, and you will find it delicious. 

BROCCOLI. 

Strip oft" all the side shoots, leaving the top ; peel off 
the skin of the stalk ; cut close off at the bottom, and 



92 EXCELSIOR COOK POOK 

put into a pan of cold water ; let it remain until you 
can boil some water, then throw in with salt ; let it boil 
briskly, till tender ; take up with a slice, that it may not 
break. It is nice served on toast, like asparagus. 

BRUSSELS SPOUTS. 

Trim and wash clean ; then throw into cold water 
an hour ; have some water boiling, and put in with a 
handful of salt ; boil till tender. Drain off the water, 
and serve hot. 

TO STEW CELERY. 

Cut up in pieces ; take off the green ends ; stew in 
milk and water, till tender ; thicken with a little flour ; 
add a little butter ; boil up ; then add two eggs beaten, 
with a cup of cream, pepper, and salt. 

FRIED POTATOES. 

Peel uncooked potatoes ; wash clean, and cut in thin 
slices ; then fry in butter of a nice brown ; lay them 
upon another dish, and send to the table hot. 

NEW POTATOES IK BUTTER. 

Scrape new potatoes, and wash clean ; put in a sauce- 
pan, with a piece of butter the size of an egg ; cover 
tight, and stew slowly. This is a nice way of doing 
new potatoes ; and, if you like, mash them when done, 
and add a little salt and cream. 

TO FRY POTATOES. 

Pare and slice thin ; fry in plenty of nice lard, and 
drain in a sieve ; or j^eel large potatoes, round and 
round, as you would an apple, in shavings, and fry un- 
til brown ; then drain in a sieve ; sprinkle salt on when 
sent to the table. A very nice way to do them, is to 
take mashed potatoes, and make in little flat cakes, 
then dip in the beaten yolk of an egg, and then in flour 
or bread-crumbs, and fry in butter. They look very 
nice. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Take out the seeds, and fill up with bread-crumbs ; 
then put in a square tin, and bake ; eat with butter and 
sugar, cream if you like. Take a dozen large toma- 



AND housekeeper's AID. 93 

toes ; pour on boiling water to take off the skins ; cut 
in slices in a stewpan; add a tea-cup and a half of 
bread-crumbs, a table-spoonful of salt, a tea-spoonful 
of pepper, and four spoonfuls of butter ; let them stew 
gently four or five hours. Fifteen minutes before serv; 
ing, beat up six eggs ; boil up, stirring all the time. 

PICKLING-. 

Pickles should always be made in brass, copper, or 
tin, and never allowed to remain in them longer than 
while they are warming. Cider vinegar is the best for 
pickling. Boil your spices with a little alum in your 
vinegar. I think it kills the life of the vinegar to heat 
it much. I prefer to scald my spices in a tin cup, with 
a little vinegar, and pour in. The pickles will keep 
longer- than they will if boiled with the vinegar. If 
wanted for immediate use, they may be scalded. For 
ripe tomatoes, the vinegar should always be cold, as 
they will soften if put into warm vinegar. Wooden 
tubs, or stone jars are best for pickles. They should 
never be put into glazed earthenware, as it contains 
lead, and will combine with the vinegar, which ren- 
ders them poisonous. A cloth should be kept on top, 
to take up the scum as it rises, then rinse it off in cold 
water, and put back. 

Pickles should be stirred occasionally, and if any 
soft ones are found, they must be taken out. If the 
vinegar is too sharp, it will eat the pickles. If too 
weak, pour off and add more, putting in more alum, as 
that hardens them. Salt kills the life of the vinegar, 
and but little should be used. Any thing that has held 
grease will spoil pickles. If vinegar is boiled for pick- 
les, it should not be boiled but a few minutes. Brass 
or copper should be perfectly cleaned before using. 
Never keejD pickles in glazed jars. Many families have 
been poisoned thereby. 

A NICE 'WAY OF PICKLINa CUCUMBERS. 

Pick every day from the vines ; wash clean with a 
cloth ; be careful not to bruise them, and if cut from 
the vines with a little stem on, they will keep better. 



94 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

Make a brine of rock salt, strong enough to bear up 
an egg; jDut them in a tub, or stone jar, and cover 
with the brine. In tAventy-four hours stir from the 
bottom; then pour off the brine, and scald it; then 
pour over them again ; let stand nine days, boiling and 
skimming the brine every third day ; then take them 
out and rinse in cold water, and if too salt, let them 
soak awhile; wash the tub or jar clean; put them in 
again, and pour on cold vinegar, or scald it, just as you 
like. If spice is added, it may be tied in a bag, and 
thrown in, with a little alum, and red pepper ; cover 
tight ; if a scum rises, scald, pour on again ; keep a 
cloth on top ; put in mustard. 

A MORE DELICATE PICKLE. 

When fresh picked, pour on boiling water, with a lit- 
tle salt ; let them remain four or five hours ; then put 
into cold vinegar, with alum dissolved. When you 
have finished collecting the cucumbers, turn the vine- 
gar from them ; scald and skim it, until clear ; then 
scald the cucumbers, but not boil, adding ginger-root, 
pepper-corns, and red peppers, sufiicient to spice the 
pickles ; if scum rises on top, scald the vinegar, and 
pour on hot ; if weak, throw away, and add more, with 
more alum ; if any are soft, take them out. If wanted 
for a sweet pickle, add sugar when scalded. 

TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. 

Stew in salt and water, just enough to prevent their 
sticking ; then pour ofi" the water, and jmt in cold spiced 
vinegar. Cork tight and keep in a cool place. 

BUTTERNUTS AND BLACK "WALNUTS. NO. 2. 

Take them green, when a knitting-needle can easily 
be run through them ; soak in salt water for a week, 
often changing the brine ; then drain ofi" the water, and 
wipe with a dry towel, a coarse one is best, until they 
Ijccome smooth. To each gallon of vinegar used, add 
half an ounce of allspice, the same of pepper-corns, a 
table-spoonful of mace, and cloves, a tea-cupful of salt ; 
let them remain a week, then turn the vinegar olf, and 



AND housekeeper's AID. 95 

scald it, boiling hot, and pour on. The vinegar in 
which they are pickled will make nice catsup. 

YELLO^W PICKLE. 

Take thirty ripe cucumbers, pare and split them J 
take the seeds out ; spread them on a board ; sprinkle 
a little salt over them ; let them remain twelve hours ; 
then put them in the sun, and let them remain imtil 
dry, turning them every day, and bringing them in at 
night ; then wash them in vinegar ; then put them in a 
jar, with a layer of mustard seed, horse-radish, onions, 
sliced, alternately. Take two quarts of vinegar, one 
ounce of race mustard, a few cloves, allspice, and cin- 
namon ; let it simmer awhile ; when cool, pour it on 
on the pickles. They will keep for years. The onions 
can be left out, if wished. 

TOMATO PICCALILLY. 

Take one peck of green tomatoes ; put a half-pint of 
salt on them ; stew them fifteen minutes ; then let them 
stand all night; drain the water off; then slice them, 
and put a layer of sliced onions, alternately, with the 
spices. Take one quarter of a pound of ground mus- 
tard, one quarter of a pound white mustard, two ounces 
of black pepper, half an ounce of ground pepper, one 
ounce of cloves, cinnamon, and mace, each, four nut- 
megs. Turn good vinegar on, and let them simmer 
two or three hours. 

GREEISr TOMATOES. 

Cut up green tomatoes in slices ; put them in a jar, 
and sprinkle salt over each layer ; let them stand twenty- 
four hours ; then wash the salt off, and let them drain 
in a colander. Prepare your vinegar with spices, and 
•sugar, say two pounds of sugar to one gallon of vine- 
gar. 

KIPE TOMATOES. 

They should not be very ripe ; wash them, and put 
them in a weak brine, where they must remain twenty- 
four hours ; then rinse them off, and throw them in cold 
vinegar ; take mustard and spices, different kinds, put 
them in cloths, and boil in a little vinegar, and turn in. 



96 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

They will not be fit for use, quite as soon as if the vine- 
gar was turned on hot, but will keep longer. Another 
way : Take one gallon ripe tomatoes, peeled ; add mus- 
tard, cloves, cinnamon, red pepper, and a very little 
salt ; grind the spices, and tie in a cloth. Cover the 
whole with vinegar, and let it scald, but not boil. 

MELON MANG-OES. 

Take green melons, and pour over them a boiling 
hot brine, strong enough to bear up an egg, and let 
them stand nine days ; then take them out, and cut 
them open on one side, and take out the seeds ; scrape 
them clean ; then take small cucumbers, green tomatoes, 
cabbage, chopped fine, with mustard, cloves, cinfiamon, 
and nutmeg, also pepper. Sew them up, or tie them, 
and put in a jar; then pour hot spiced vinegar over 
them. 

-WALNUTS AND BUTTERNUTS. 

Take butternuts, or black walnuts, when you can 
thrust a pin through them ; put them in a weak lye, 
and stir them well to get the roughness ofi", or scald 
them, and rub with a flannel cloth ; soak them in a 
brine about a week ; then pierce them through with a 
large needle, and lay them in a jar ; scald your vinegar, 
adding spices and mustard. They must be covered 
tight, and kept from the air. 

CUCUMBERS. 

Gather the cucumbers small, and put them in a weak 
brine ; let them stand twenty-four hours ; then scald 
your vinegar, with cloves, cinnamon, and pepper, and 
turn on. If you wish them green, add a little alum. 
If you wish to keep them any time, wash them, and lay 
them in a barrel, with a layer of salt, alternately, until 
your barrel is full ; then put a cloth on top, lay a board • 
over, and a stone to keep them under the brine. They 
will keep for years. They must be soaked several days 
before using ; then turn on vinegar, as above. 

RADISH PODS. 

Kadish pods may be pickled by letting them stand 
in salt and water a few days, and then pickle like cu- 
cumbers. 



AKD housekeeper's AID. 9^ 

GKEEN" BEANS. 

Boil the beans in a little salt and water, until quite 
tender ; then take them out, and pour cold vinegar on, 
but scald the spic|!S in a little water or vinegar. 

MARTIWOES. 

Soak in salt and water, two or three days, changing 
tlie water every day, or they will grow soft ; then scald 
them with vinegar and spices 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Select the nicest, and cut off the stalk ; divide the 
flower into six or eight pieces, and scald in brine ; let 
them remain until the next day ; then rinse and dry 
them ; lay them carefully in a jar, net to break them, 
and pour over them hot spiced vinegar. Asparagus 
and broccoli may be pickled the same way. 

CABBAGE. 

Chop fine and lay in a jar ; scald your vinegar with 
spices, and turn on ; scald it several times and turn 
on ; it will make it more tender. 

NASTURTIOirS. 
They must be gathered when ripe ; wash them, and 
put them in cold vinegar; they require no spicing. 
Capers are done in the same manner. 

ONIONS. 

Take off the outer skin, and soak them two or three 
days in brine ; then scald them in milk and water, and 
drain them ; lay them in a jar and pour cold vinegar 
on them; scald your spices, adding a little alum; 
cover close. 

PLUMS. 

Take seven pounds of plums; three pounds of 
sugar ; one quart of vinegar ; one ounce of cinnamon ; 
one ounce of cloves ; place a layer of plums, spices, 
and sugar ; scald your vinegar and pour over the fruit, 
repeating the process three times, three days in suc- 
cession ; then place them in a preserving-kettle, and 
let them come to a slow boil ; they are then fit for use.

nasturtions, walnuts, butternuts, cherries, peaches, 
apricots, capers, green grapes, and butter onions ; 
make a brine that will bear an egg ; pour on boiling 
hot ; let them stand a few days, stirring them every 
day ; take them out and drain well ; then make vine- 
gar warm with spices added, and pour on, adding 
English mustard-seed ; cover close and it will keep for 
years. 

PICKLED APPLES. 

Take three quarts of vinegar, one of water, three 
pounds of sugar, cinnamon, cloves, allspice to your 
taste ; heat boiling hot, and turn on two or three 
times ; peaches, pears, and plums may be pickled in 
the same way. 

GREEN TOMATO CATSUP. 

Slice green tomatoes, and sprinkle a little salt over 
them ; boil twenty minutes in vinegar and water, with 
a pound of sugar ; take them out and put a layer of 
tomatoes, then pepper, mustard, horse-radish, onions,

them ; then another layer alternately, until the jar is 
fuU. 

RIPE TOMATO CATSUP.

the same of allspice ; add one pint more vinegar ; set 
on the fire, and remain until the right consistency ; let 
it cool, when you can bottle it for use. It should be 
made in tin. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 99 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

Another way : Take ripe tomatots ; wash and strain 
them ; then to every quart, add two ounces of bUxck 
pepper, one of cinnamon, one of cloves, a little mace 
or nutmeg, Cayenne pepper, and salt, to suit the taste ; 
boil slowly an hour ; then add half a pint of the best 
cider vinegar ; after which, bottle it, and seal tightly. 
Another way : Take one bushel of ripe tomatoes, and 
boil until soft ; strain through a sieve ; add half a gal- 
lon of vinegar, a pint and a half of salt, two ounces 
of cloves, two of allspice, two of Cayenne pei)pcr, 
four table-spoonfuls of black pepper, four of mustard ; 
mix together, and boil until reduced one half, then 
bottle tight. 

MUSHKOOM CATSUP. 

Take the full-grown tops ; wash them clean ; mash 
them ; then sprinkle salt over them, and let them re- 
main all night ; put in a stewpan, and let them stand 
in a hot oven ten or twelve hours ; then strain through 
a sieve to press out all the juice ; and to every gallon 
of liquor put half a pound of salt, one ounce of cloves, 
one of cinnamon, one of black pepper, an ounce of 
ginger ; put them over the fire until reduced one half; 
then turn in an earthen dish to cool, when it can be 
battled for use ; should it not keep good, it can be 
heated over. 

TO PICKLE GHERKINS. 
Put in a strong brine until they are yellow ; then in 
hot spiced vinegar, and keep in a warm place until 
they turn green ; then pour off the vinegar and pour 
on more. 

BARBERRIES AND CURRANTS.' 

Take bunches of currants Avhen ripe, and put in 
good cider vinegar. Barberries should be preserved 
by drying, as they retain their color better than any 
other way ; when used, pour on vinegar scalding hot, 
and let them remain until they swell out to their origi- 
nal size. 

PEPPERS. 

Take ripe peppers and cut open with a knife ; take 
out the seed, and soak in brine eight or nine days, 



100 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

changing the water every day ; keep in a warm place ; 
rinse in cold water and stuff with chopped cabbage, 
small green tomatoes, or cucumbers, nasturiions or 
any thing yoii like ; season with cloves, cinnamon, and 
allspice ; sew them up and put in cold vinegar. The 
large sweet pepper is best for pickling ; they are nice 
made into a sweet pickle ; they may be soaked one 
day and then scalded in a weak brine, and thrown into 
cold vinegar, or put in cold spiced vinegar without 
soaking or scalding. 

MARTIKOES. 

Take them when you can run a pin in them ; put in 
a brine a week or ten days, changing every day ; then 
wipe with a course towel, and pour on spiced vinegar 
boiling hot ; in fom* weeks they will be ready for use. 

PEPPER VINEGAR. 

Take a dozen ripe pepper pods ; split and boil them 
in three pints of vinegar, until one quart remains, then 
strain through a sieve ; this is nice for salads, catsups, 
and sauces ; it also imparts a nice flavor to pickles. 

PICKLED PEACHES. 

Take those that are not very ripe, and pour on boil- 
ing water ; take out and wipe dry, in order to get off 
the down ; take a gallon of weak vinegar, thi"^e 
pounds of sugar to a peck of peaches ; scald it, and 
put in three eggs, the whites only, and they must be 
well beaten ; skim imtil clear, and every time skim- 
ming take from the fire ; they should be filled with 
cassia buds. 

PICKLED APPLES. NO. 2. 

Take three pounds of sugar to three pints of weak 
vinegar, a stick or two of cinnamon, a few cloves ; pare 
sweet apples, and put them in whole, and boil until 
tender. Pears may be pickled in the same way. 

PICKLED PEACHES. NO. 2. 

Wipe off the down witli a wet cloth ; lay them in 
jars, and pour over them a boiling hot syrup made of 
one quart of vinegar, three j^ounds of sugar, one ounce 
of cinnamon, and a little allspice ; four cloves should 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 101 

be put in the peaches before putting in the jars;* let 
them stand a day, and pour off the pickle and scald, 
and pour on again ; repeat this next day,, and they will 
keep well. Other fruit may be pickled in the same 
way. 

PLUMS AND CHERillES. 

Put them in jars, with a layer of cinnamon or cloves 
between each layer of frnit ; dissolve half a pound of 
white sugar to a pound of fruit in good vinegar ; then 
cover the whole with it, and set the jar in a pot of 
cold water ; set the jar over the fire until they begin 
to boil, then take off. 

FROSTING CAKE. 

A quarter of a pound of white powdered sugar, to 
one egg, or two thirds of a tea-cupful ; whip the white 
of the"eg2: to a stiff froth, then add the sugar by de- 
grees, until it becomes smooth ; flavor with lemon-juice ; 
spread it on evenly with a knife while the cake is 
warm, and it will soon dry ; if the cake is cold when 
frosted, put it in a Avarm place till it dries. ^ The orna- 
mental frosting on cake is done with a syringe ; have 
lemon-juice in the frosting to make it keep its place ; 
then draw the frosting into the syringe, and make your 
fii^ures as you press it out ; it must not be put on till 
the frosting is hardened ; sometimes a little starch may 
be put into frosting, but it will not require so much 
sugar ; it is a good plan to sift a little flour over the 
cake before frosting it, as it will spread more evenly. 
Before cutting an Iced cake, the icing should be cut 
with a penknife, for a large knife used for cutting the 
cake will break the frosting. 

COLORING FOR ICING. 

Take twenty grains of cochineal powder, the same 
of cream of tartar, and twenty grains of alum; add a 
gill of soft water, and scald it, but not boil ; strain 
through a bit of muslin, and cork up for use. A very 
little of this will color icing a beautiful pink ; then 
use white nonpareils. Rich cake that has brandy or 
wine in, will keep a long time. If made without milk 



102 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

or soda, it will keep longer. It can be made to taste 
almost like fresh if it becomes stale, by putting it in a 
basin, and setting it in a larger one with a little water 
in ; put in a moderate oven, and cover the cake to 
keep in the steam ; and Avhen hot, take from the oven, 
and let it get cool before cutting it. • 

DIRECTIOKS FOB MAKING CAKE. 

The materials for making cake must be nice and 
fresh, or the cake will not be good ; white sugar should 
always be used for delicate cake; prepare all your 
articles first, raisins stoned, Zante currants washed and 
dried, citron cut in pieces, and almonds blanched by 
putting them in hot water and letting them remain 
until the skins can be rubbed off; then dry, and pound 
them with a little rose-water or extract of lemon ; 
in warm weather the eggs should be cooled before 
using; if frozen put in cold water to take out the frost. 
Frozen eggs will not make as nice cake. Butter, if 
washed before using, will make more delicate cake. 
The butter and sugar should be stirred to a cream ; if 
milk is used, stir in gradually with half the flour; 
then the yolks of the eggs, with some flour; the 
whites next, with the remainder of the flour; soda 
always added last. Fruit should be rolled in flour to 
prevent its sticking to the bottom. The eggs will 
beat light sooner by beating them separate. Some 
cakes require a hotter oven than others ; the cook will 
soon learn this from experience. If baking too fast 
on top, put a piece of paper over ; when about done, 
try with a knife, (or a splinter kept for this purpose is 
best ;) if it does not adhere to it, it is done. 

PLUM CAKE. 

Mix two quarts of flour with a pound of sifted loaf- 
sugar; three pounds of currants; half a pound of 
ratsins, stoned and chopped ; a quarter of an ounce 
of mace and cloves ; a grated nutmeg ; the peel of a 
lemon, cut fine ; melt two pounds of butter in a pint 
and a quarter of cream, but not hot ; the whites and 
yolks of twelve eggs beaten apart, and half a pint 
good yeast: beat them all together a full hour: put

PASTRY AND PIES. 

For plain pastiy, allow half a pound of shortening 
to a pound of flour, and for rich pastry, allow three 
quarters of a pound. Lard makes the most delicate 
looking crust ; but if some butter is used, the crust will 
be nicer. Rub half the shortening with two thirds of 
the flour. When the flour and shortening are well 
rubbed together, add water sufficient to enable you to 
roll out. If rolled a number of times, it will be more 
flaky. When rolled out, put on more of the shorten- 
ing with the flour; and always roll from you. It 
should be made as quick and as cold as possible. In 
cold weather it should be warmed a little, but not 
melted, or it will not be flaky. A plain, tender crust 
may be made of sour milk with soda ; but it will not 
require so much shortening. Sweet cream and soda is 
still nicer. Good potatoes boiled in salted water and 
strained, add to the same quantity of flour, wet with 
sour milk, and soda, makes a very tender crust, and 
requires no shortening. Light bread dough, with a 
little butter added, and rolled thin, makes a nice crust 
for meat pies, and for the upper crust of fruit pies, to 
be made without bottom crusts. 

DIRECTIOlSrS FOR MAKING VERY NICE PASTE. 

Take a quarter of a pound of shortening and rub 
into the flour, wet with cold water just enough to roll 
out. Then take the remainder and cut in very thin 
slices. Sprinkle a thick layer of flour on the mould- 
ing-board ; lay on the flour the slices of shortening. 
Sprinkle on more flour and roll out in thin sheets ; then 
roll out the paste and cover with a sheet of this. 
Sprinkle on more flour and fold up ; then roll out again, 
and repeat until the shortening is used up. 

PUFF PASTE. 

Dissolve a little sal-volatile in cold water, then take 
one pound and a quarter of flour, one pound of butter ; 
rub one third of the butter with two thirds of the 
flour, and add the sal-volatile with a little salt. Mois- 
ten with water to a nice paste ; then cut the butter in 



AND nOUSEKEEPER^S AID. 123 

slices as directed above. Roll out lightly about one 
third of an inch in thickness, and use for pufis or rim 
and upper crust to pies. It should be baked quick, 
and of a light brown ; if baking too fast, put a paper 
on top. 

QUINCE TARTS. 

Take six quinces, half a pound of sugar, half a pint 
of cream, four eggs, and nutmeg to the taste. 

COCOA-WUT PIE. 

Save the milk taken out of the cocoa-nut, grate the 
white part and put the milk Avith it, say a quart ; if 
not able to save the milk, add other milk. Simmer it 
together for a quarter of an hour ; then take it from 
the fire and mix two large spoonfuls of butter, four of 
white sugar, a small cracker pounded fine, and half a 
nutmeg. When cool, add five well-beaten eggs and a 
wine-glass of wine. Turn into deep plates with a lin- 
ing and rim of nice pastry, and bake in a quick oven. 
They must be eaten cold. 

MABLBOROUGH TARTS. 

Stew tart apples tender ; strain through a fine colan- 
der. To twelve large spoonfuls of the apples, add the 
juice and grated rind of a lemon, three spoonfuls of 
melted butter, half a pint of milk or cream, a wine- 
glass of wine, half a nutmeg, four well-beaten eggs, 
and sugar to the taste. Bake with a lining and rim ; 
ornament them with pastry cut in flowers, or any de- 
sign you like. If for grapes, cut with a thimble, and 
for the leaves, use a pen-knife. 

LEMON PIE. NO. 3. 

Grate two lemons, add the juice, but leave out the 
white part ; add two large spoonfuls of rolled crackers, 
one of butter, six of white sugar, and six beaten eggs. 
Put all into a quart of milk, and bake in deep plates 
with pastry on the bottom, with a rim. 

A PIE-CRUST "WITH VERY LITTLE BUTTER. 

Take one pound of flour, and two table-spoonfuls of 
shortening, one tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda ; dis- 



124 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

solve half a tea-spoonful of tartaric acid in cold water, 
adding enough to make a paste ; roll quickly. It is 
made better by adding an egg before the water is put in. 

PASTE FOR FAMILY PIES. 

Rub half a pound of shortening into a pound and a 
half of flour, wet with cold water sufiicient to make a 
paste. Roll out several times. 

PYRAMID PASTE. 

Make a rich puff paste, and cut with different sized 
cake-cutters, fitting one into another ; cut a bit out of 
each one, except the top one and bottom ; bake on 
buttered paj^er laid on tins ; then build them in a py- 
ramid form, laying different preserved fruit on each 
one, and on the top a whole apricot with a sprig of 
myrtle stuck in, currants or green gages. 

MINCE PIE ^WITHOUT MEAT. 

Take four soda crackers, half a tea-cupful of water, 
half a cujD of melted butter, half a cup of vinegar, half 
a cup of boiled cider, one cup of molasses, one cup of 
sugar, one cup of chopj^ed raisins. Add spices. 

A DELICIOUS LEMON PIE. 

Take the juice and grate the rind of one lemon ; take 
the yolks of two eggs and one cup of sugar, three 
table-spoonfuls of flour, with sufiicient milk to fill the 
dish, and bake until brown. Then beat the whites of 
the eggs ; add four table-spoonfuls of sugar, and spread 
over the pie. 

MELON PIE. 

Pare and stew the melon the same as pumpkin ; to 
one pint of melon add one tea-spoonful of tartaric acid, 
or a lemon cut up fine, a small piece of butter, spice 
the same as for pumpkin. Bake without a crust. 

A MINCE PIE TVITHOUT MEAT. NO. 2. :

eight cloves, and half pint of French brandy; cover it 
close and keep for use. 

GROUND CHERR'S PIE. 

One pint ground cherries husked and washed, two 
table-spoonfuls of sugar, half a lemon cut in small 
pieces, or half a tea-spoonful of the extract ; bake in a 
slow oven. They can be dried and kept for winter 
use ; just before using, soak half an hour. 

A DELICATE APPLE PIE. 

Make a rich syrup of white sugar, boil lemon-peel to 
flavor it ; then put in tart apples that have been nicely 
quartered ; only put a few in at a time ; take out as 
soon as tender, and put in your pie-plates ; if not sea- 
soned sufficiently, add more lemon ; put on a nice crust. 

APPLE PUFFS. 

Mix a quarter of a pound of butter with a quart of 
sifted flour ; beat two eggs, and a little salt. Rub well 
together with half a tea-spoonful of soda dissolved in 
cold water. Moisten with cold Avater just enough to 
roll it out easily. It must be rolled very thin, and cut 
with a tumbler ; put three together, sprinkle flour be- 
tween each one ; put on the top a few thin slices of 
tart apples ; sprinkle sugar and nutmeg over. Double 
the pastry over them so as to form a crescent ; press 
the edges together, and fry in lard. When of a light 
brown, take up carefully. 

GRAPE PIE. 

Take green grapes, stew and strain, and sweeten to 
the taste. If made of whole grapes, allow a tea-cupful 
of sugar to each pie, or a little water. 

MARINGOES OR CREAM PUFFS. 

Kub half a pound of butter, three quarters of a 
pound of flour together ; stir into a pint of boiling 
water while boiling. When thick, remove from the 
fire. When cool, stir in a small tea-spoonful of soda, 



126 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

• 

ten well-beaten eggs ; drop tlie mixture on buttered 

tins Vvdtli a large spoon, put several inches apart ; bake 

of a light brown, in a quick oven. When done, open 

on one side and fill with mock cream, which is made 

as follows : One quart of milk scalded, beat four eggs 

to a froth, one cup of sugar, one cup of flour, stir into 

the milk while boiling ; when thick remove from the 

fire; flavor with lemon or vanilla. Put in the pufis 

when cold. 

MAKIWGOES. ]SrO. 2. 

Take the whites of eight eggs and whisk to a froth. 
Stir in half a pound of white sifted sugar. Flavor with 
any thing you like ; then sift powdered sugar over them 
and bake on a board in a slow oven. When done, take 
them up and beat the under side with a spoon to form 
a hollow, and dry them; fill with cream or preserved 
fruit ; put two together, which will form an oval shape. 

SlfO^W-BALIiS. 

Boil some rice until half cooked ; then pare and core, 
but not cut, some apples ; put into each a little salt and 
cinnamon or lemon-peel, and then put some of the rice 
on a cloth, and put the apples in ; tie up and boil one 
hour. Eat with sugar and cream. 

MI]NrCE PIES 

may be made by using potatoes in the j^lace of ap- 
ples. Pare and chop the potatoes fine, then soak them 
over night in vinegar, and they can not be told from 
apples. Turnips or beets may be used, though not as 
good as potatoes. 

A PUMPKIN" PIE "WITHOUT STEWING THE 
PUMPKIN. 

Pare and grate the pumpkin, and to every pint add 
n pint of rich milk, two eggs, spices, a little flour and 
ealt. Squash pies may be made the same, or stewed, 
according to the taste. I have also made carrot pies 
in this way, which are rich and nice. 

CUSTARD PIES. 

Two eggs well beaten, a table-spoonful and a half 
of sugar, a table-spoonful of flour, and a pint and a 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 127 

half of milk, makes a good pie. But if you want it 
rich, take four eggs, nutmeg, and lemon ; also a little 
salt ; bake in a slow oven ; be careful not to bake too 
much, as that will make it whey. 

MOCK APPLE PIE. 

One tea« cupful of light bread, two of water, one 
and a half of sugar, one tea-spoonful of tartaric acid, 
•a little salt, cinnamon and lemon, if you like ; boil the 
bread and water five minutes ; then add the other in- 
gredients. 

ANOTHER. 

Six crackers, one tea-cupful of water, one of sugar, 
one tea-spoonful tartaric acid, a piece of butter the size 
of a hickory-nut, and a little salt. 

By using an egg and only four crackers, makes a 
nice pie. 

RHUBARB PIE. 

Pull the stalks oif, (not cut them, as it injures the 
roots ;) take the outside off, which peels easily ; cut 
up in pieces an inch long ; wash clean in cold water ; 
have your crust ready, and put the pieces in evenly ; 
sprinkle a little flour over them, a small piece of but- 
ter, and a tea-cupful of sugar; put on another crust, 
and bake in a slow oven. Sometimes a little nutmeg or 
lemon is an addition, but this is according to the taste. 

ANOTHER. 

Stew the rhubarb in a little water, and take one tea- 
cupful after it is stewed, one tea-cupful of sugar, and 
one egg, well beaten; a little butter. This makes a 
very nice pie. 

BLACKBERRY OR RASPBERRY PIE. 

Make a rich crust, and lay the berries in ; sprinkle a 
little flour over them, a little water, and two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar ; put on an upper crust ; bake in a 

slow oven. 

GREEN" APPLE PIE. 

Pare and slice the apples very thin ; lay in your 
crust ; sprinkle a little flour over them ; turn in a very 
little water, (if the apples are juicy, they will not re- 



128 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

quire so much water as those that are not ;) put in sugar,- 
according to the taste ; if the apples are very sour, they 
require more ; a piece of butter, any kind of spice you 
like, nutmeg or lemon, is preferable to any other. 

ANOTHER. 

Pare and slice the apples ; put them in your crust, 
with a little water, but no seasoning whatever ; when 
baked, take off the upper crust ; put in sugar, butter,- 
and spices to suit the taste. This is nice eaten warm. 

Another way I have of making a green apple pie : 
Take off the upper crust ; take out half the apple in 
another dish, (after spicing and seasoning it to your 
taste ;) turn the upper crust bottom-side up ; put in 
the apple you have taken out, and put a few spoonfuls 
of rich cream in ; grate in a little more nutmeg. This 
makes a very delicious pie. I make quite a thick crust, 
and fill very full with apples. 

Another way of making apple pies is, to stew the ap- 
ples, season with sugar and spices, and put in a crust, 
and bake in a slow oven. 

PUMPKIN PIE. 

Stew the pumpkin ; strain through a colander ; and 
to two tea-cupfuls, take one and a half of rich milk, a 
table-spoonful of flour, one tea-spoonful of ginger, a 
little salt, and a little allspice ; bake in a quick oven. 

A PUMPKIN" PIE WITH EGGS. 

Stew the pumpkin down dry; strain, and to every 
tea-cupful and a half, add a pint of milk and one Qgg-, 
a little nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and a little salt. This 
makes a rich pie. 

BUTTERNUT PIE. 

A tea-cupful of butter-nut meats, two eggs, a pint 
and a half of milk, nearly two table-spoonfuls of sugar. 

A hickory pie may be made in the same way. They 
have a very nice flavor. 

CURRANT PIE. 
Take green currants ; pick them clean, and wash ; a 
single handful of flour sprinkled over the fruit, and 



AND housekeeper's AID. 129 

plenty of sugar, with a little water ; they are liable to 
run over if too much is put in. A little molasses — say 
half molasses and half sugar — is nice for a currant pie. 
One half raisins is a great improvement. 

DRIED APPLE PIES. 

Stew the apple, and then strain it through a colan- 
der ; season according to the taste, and bake in a slow 
oven. 

TAUT PIES 

may be made of almost any kind of fruit which is 
tart ; and put in a rich paste ; cut strips of pastry, and 
twist it, and put on the top, in any shape you fancy. 
I have made very nice tarts of cider apple-sauce. 

TAKTS. 

Make a rich paste ; cut out with a tumbler or cake- 
cutter ; then cut strips of paste to lay on top ; press it 
in the middle to form deeper ; then lay in sweetmeats, 
and bake on tins. 

APPLE CUSTAKD PIE. 

Grate five sweet apples for every pie, a pint and a 
half of rich milk, two eggs, sugar, a little salt, nutmeg 
or lemon ; bake as a custard pie. 

LEMOW PIE. K"0. 4. 

One lemon sliced very thin, one tea-cupful of sugar, 
one of water, one egg ; bake in a slow oven. It is 
very good without the egg, but will require a table- 
spoonful of flour. 

A KICE PIE. 

Wash and boil the rice until nearly done ; one tea- 
cupful after it is boiled, two eggs, a pint and a half of 
milk, a little salt, sugar, nutmeg ; bake as a custard 
pie. 

MI]SrCE PIES. 

Boil beef until it will slip off the bone ; the head 
and heart are nice for pies ; chop fine ; take one quart 
of meat to two of green apples, chopped fine. A 
plenty of box raisins, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, nut- 
meg, pepper, salt, are all necessary for these pies ; 
6* 



130 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

also a little boiled cider, whicli takes the place of 
brandy; use either molasses or sugar; I think half 
of each is better, and sometimes I use a little lemon, 
which is an improvement. Put in all the ingredients, 
and put over a slow fire, and let it simmer an hour, 
when they can be put in the paste, and bake slowly. 
These pies will keep longer than any other, and are a 
favorite with almost every one. If you do not wish 
to use all your meat at once, put in the spices, and 
cover with molasses ; then set it away in the cellar 
until needed, when the apples can be added, and more 
seasoning, if required. 

COCOA-NUT PIE. NO. 2. 

Grate it, and mix with milk ; boil eight or ten min- 
utes. To a pint of cocoa-nuts, add a quart of milk, and 
four eggs, a little sweet cream, a cracker rolled fine, 
and a little nutmeg ; bake in a deep dish, like a cus- 
tard. 

TOMATO PIE. 

Take green tomatoes ; pare and slice them ; lay in 
the crust; sprinkle over a little flour, sugar or mo- 
lasses, part of a lemon sliced, and a little water. This 
makes an excellent pie. 

You can use ripe tomatoes if you like, but they re- 
quire an egg, and a little cream. 

DKIED TOMATO PIE. 

Take ripe ones ; throw them in boiling water to take 
the skins off; then slice them ; lay them on dishes ; sprin- 
kle a little sugar over them, and dry in a warm oven. 
They can be put in bags for winter use. Soak in a lit- 
tle water, and lay in the paste, with lemon, a little 
flour and sugar. 

ELDERBEKIIY PIE. 

This pie requires but very little sugar. A table- 
spoonful of vinegar or a little lemon, with a little flour 
sprinkled over, is an improvement. They are a juicy 
pie, and will need no water. Bake slowly. 

A CHEKRY PIE. 

Stone your cherries ; lay them in your paste, put in 
a sufficient quantity of sugar, a little water, and a hand- 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 181 

ful of flour sprinkled over ; then put on a nice paste. 
Some prefer molasses instead of sugar. They require 
no water, if molasses is used. 

PEACH PIE. 

Pare and slice the peaches ; sprinkle over a little 
flour and sugar, then a rich crust, and bake slowly. 
This is a most delicious pie. Dried peaches are made 
the same, except the peaches must be stewed first. 

AlSrOTHER LEMOW PIE. 

Grate three lemons ; beat three eggs, one tea-cupful 
of water, three table-spoonfuls of sugar to each lemon. 

GOOSEBERRY PIE. 

Rub the gooseberry in a flannel cloth to take the 
prickles ofi"; then wash clean, and make as a currant pie. 

QUINCE PIE. 

Pare six apples and one quince ; stew until soft ; then 
sweeten them, and bake in a crust. 

CRANBERRY TARTS. 
One pound of sugar to one quart of cranberries ; put 
a little water on them, and stew until done. When 
wanted for use, put them in a rich paste. 

APPLE PUFPS. 

Pare the apples, and bake them slowly ; when cold, 
season with sugar and lemon-peel grated, or cmnamon ; 
bake them in a thin paste. 

A CREAM PIE. 

Make a rich crust ; beat one egg, one pint and a half 
of rich cream, and one table-spoonful of flour, a little 
salt, nutmeg, or lemon. Bake as a custard. 

LEMON CREAM PIE. 
One raw potato grated, one cup of water, one cup of 
sugar, one lemon grated, and juice added ; baked m 
pastry, top and bottom.

PUDDING-S. 

DIKECTIONS FOB PUDDINGS. 

For boiled puddings, a bag should be made of thick 
cotton cloth, or a tin basin is the best, with the cover 
fitting tight, and then tied on. If a cloth is used, it 
must be wrung out of hot water, and floured on the 
inside. It must have room to swell, as they swell while 
boiling. Put a skewer on plate in the kettle to prevent 
it sticking to the bottom. The water must boil when 
the pudding is put in, and in five minutes must be turn- 
ed over, or it is apt to be heavy, if not turned. If the 
water boils down, more must be added, but it must be 
boiling hot, and not suffered to get off a boil until taken 
up. When taken out of the bag, di}) into cold water 
for a minute, and it will easily slip out. Raisins or 
fruits should be rolled in flour to prevent their settling. 
Plum puddings are better if made the night before 
used, the eggs added in the morning.

MAKING- BREAD. 
There is no cookery so conducive to the health and 
happiness of a family, as good bread, and nothing more 
detrimental than sour or heavy bread. There is a great 
difi'erence in wheat flour ; the Western flour, if pure, is 
preferable to any other. "Winter wheat makes better 
flour than spring wheat, as the latter is more like wheat 
that has grown ; but very good bread may be made 
from it by moulding it more, or making it harder. If 
wheat is grown, the flour should be scalded, and allow- 
ed to cool, before putting in the yeast, as heat kills the 
life of the yeast. Flour should always be sifted before 
using. If the directions here given are well followed, 
any person can make good bread. In the first place, 
they should supply themselves with good yeast. Many 
persons live near a bakery or a brewery, where they 
can obtain it fresh, when wanted. It is better to make 
home-made yeast, both for convenience and economy. 

YEAST CAKES. 

Take a pint of dry hops, (not over a year old, as they 
lose their strength ;) pour on two quarts of water, and 
add two potatoes sliced ; boil half an hour ; then strain 
the liquor on Indian meal, sufficient to absorb all the 
water ; stir it well, and when lukewarm, add a tea-cup- 
ful of good yeast, or one cake, previously soaked in 
warm water ; let it rise ; then add a small tea-cupful of 
brown sugar, a table-spoonful of ginger, and roll it out 
about half an inch thick ; cut in small cakes, and put 
them on a board to dry. Be careful and turn them 



148 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

every day, until dry enougli to put in a bag. Keep in a 
dry place, and they will keep good three months. When 
used, soak in lukewarm water a few minutes. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Boil a double handful of hops in three quarts of water 
down to one quart ; then strain into a quart of flour 
while boiling hot ; when cool, add half a pint of yeast ; 
let it rise, and thicken with Indian meal enough to roll 
out ; then cut in squares, and lay them on a board ; turn 
every day, until dry. Put in a bag, and hang up in a 
cool, dry place. When used, soak in warm water a few 
minutes. 

SOFT YEAST. NO. 1. 

Boil a pint of hops in three quarts of water, until re- 
duced to three pints ; strain and pour back in your ket- 
tle ; make smooth one tea-cupful of flour with cold water ; 
then stir in six middling sized potatoes, that have been 
boiled and mashed fine ; let it stand until lukewarm ; 
then strain it again, and add a cup of good yeast, and 
let it remain where it will \eep warm ; when light, add 
a table-spoonful of salt, the same of sugar, and pour 
into a jar ; set it in a cool place. When used, take a tea- 
cupful for three loaves. This will not keep long with- 
out souring, when it should not be used. It will keep 
longer to leave out the potatoes, in which case more 
flour must be added. 

POTATO YEAST. 

Mash half a dozen peeled, boiled potatoes ; make 
smooth a tea-cup of flour, and add with it a table- 
spoonful of salt. Strain through a colander, and add 
hot water until it is the consistency of batter ; when 
lukewarm, add a pint of good yeast. Let it stand till 
it rises ; then cork tight and keep in a cool place. 
This kind of yeast is nice ; but will not keep sweet as 
long as hoj) yeast. 

SOFT YEAST. NO. 2. 

Pare and grate six large potatoes ; boil a large hand- 
ful of hops in two quarts of water ; strain and pour on 
the potatoes while boiling hot ; add one tea-cupful of 



AND housekeeper's AID. 149 

brown sugar, and when sufficiently cool, put in a cup.- 
ful of yeast ; -let it rise, and then put in a jug and cork 
tight ; keep in a cool place. One tea-cupful, when 
new, is sufficient for four loaves of bread. 

BAKER'S YEAST. 

Two ounces of hops, with nine quarts of water, 
boiled an hour ; when cool, add seven pounds mashed 
potatoes, one pound of sugar, two ounces of carbonate 
soda, half an ounce spirits of wine, one poimd of flour, 
and half a pint brewer's yeast. 

MILK YEAST BREAD. 

Take one tea-cupful of milk, pour in two of boiling 
water ; stir in flour enough to make a batter ; if the 
flour is poor, put in a little saleratus. Set the vessel 
in a kettle of warm water, quite warm, and keep them 
an equal temperature, and in four or six hours they 
will rise. Make a hole in your flour, and pour in your 
wetting, which should be one third milk, the rest hot 
water ; stir to a batter, then add the yeast. Stir up 
and let it remain in a warm j)lace until it rises, (which 
will be about half an hour ;) then knead it quickly, but 
not too stifl*, and put it on tins. Let it rise again, and 
bake three quarters of an hour. It can be made with- 
out sponging, if preferred. For biscuit, use sweet 
cream for wetting, or butter and water ; let them rise 
and cut out with a cutter ; then j'ise and again bake. 
This yeast makes very white bread. 

SALT RISINa BREAD 

is made in the same way, except the milk ; a tea-spoon- 
ful of salt is added as a substitute. The bread must 
be moulded rather harder. Bran yeast may be made 
by making in the same manner, using wheat bran in 
the place of flour, and when light, strain oft' the water, 

and use as above. 

■WHEAT BREAD. 

Make a hole in the flour, in your bread-tray or bowl, 
make a sponge in it of water or milk, or half and half, 
just as you like, and add your yeast, with a little salt. 
In the morning it will be risen ; then mould, kneading 
it well — the more it is kneaded, the better will be your 



150 EXCELSIOE COOK BOOK 

bread. Let it rise again, and mould only enough to 
23ut in shape ; lay on tins, let it rise fifteen or twenty 
minutes, and bake in a moderate oven one hour. It is 
a good plan to put in a little soda or saleratus, when 
mixed in the morning, particularly if soft yeast is used, 
to prevent any sourness. If the flour has been scalded, 
or if potatoes have been added, it will require fifteen 
minutes longer to bake. When taken from the oven, 
set up on end, with a clean towel underneath ; cover 
up with a cloth, and steam ; if baked hard, it will soften 
the crust. Boiled, mashed potatoes, and a little sugar 
added, is a great improvement. 

EXCELSIOR BREAD. 

Have mashed potatoes for dinner the day you wish 
to bake, or rather the day before ; save a pint, and pour 
boiling water on them, or use some of the potato-water, 
which is better, about a pint is sufficient ; add a half 
tea-cupful of sugar, and one large yeast cake, previous- 
ly soaked, or yeast ; let it rise, and before going to bed, 
wet up your sponge with water, adding the yeast, (af- 
ter straining it.) In the morning it will be light, when 
it must be moulded — the more, the nicer will be the

best kind of wheat to make good bread. It is consid- 
ered more healthy than any other bread, particularly

ness. Make as for wheat bread, only not mould so 
hard, and add a little molasses or sugar, and bake one 
to two hours.

CUSTARDS, ETC. 

Custards are always eaten cold, and are served up m 
small cups, or poured over fruit tarts or sponge cake. 
The flavoring may be added to suit the taste. Vanilla, 
lemon, orange, and nutmegs, are all nice for custards. 
A portion of cream makes custards nicer than all milk, 
and will not require as many eggs. When made as 
cream, and eaten raw, the whites should never be put 
in, but can be used for silver cake. One mode of mak- 
ing is to measure the number of cups which you wish 
to fill, and use nearly the quantity of milk ; then sim- 
mer it upon the fire until beginning to boil, then add 
half an ounce of sugar to each cup, with lemon-peel or 
bay leaves ; then take the yolk of an egg to each cup, 
beat them well, and pour in the milk ; fill the cups, 
place in boiling water until the custard becomes firm. 
Custards are nicer if the eggs are strained after beating.

ar, a little salt, add one quart of milk, nutmeg, and 
lemon ; more eggs can be added, if wished. Bake in an

convenient to use for the purpose,) and set m a kettle ot 
boiling water ; let it remain until it begins to thicken, 
stirring it constantly, that it may not adhere to the pail ; 
then season with vanilla or lemon, just as you like, and 

turn in cups.

A VERY RICH CUSTARD. 

Boil one quart of rich milk, or what is better, half 
cream, put in a stick of cinnamon broken in small pieces; 
after boiling, strain, and set away to cool ; then stir in 
gradually one tea-cup and a half of sugar, any spice you 
like, and the yolks of ten well-beaten eggs ; then pour 
into cups, and place in a tin of water, put in a slow 
oven, and bake ; when baked, grate some nutmeg on 
top, and add the whites of the eggs beaten to a froth, 
with a table-spoonful of powdered sugar, and a little

grated lemon-peel ; mix all together, and boil until it 
begins to thicken, and then turn out and let it cool. 
COLD CUSTARD, OR JUNKET. 

Soak a piece of rennet in brandy, and keep it corked 
tight, then take one quart of milk, about as warm as 
when it comes from the cow, add a little salt and sugar, 
and stir in sufficient of the rennet to thicken the milk ; 
then turn into cups, and grate a little nutm.eg on the

cream instead. This is very nice to serve with peaches 
and strawberries. 

BLANC MANGE. 

Take one ounce of isinglass, two quarts of milk, sea- 
soned to your taste ; the isinglass having been dissolved 
in boiling water over night ; put on the fire and boil,

looks like float ; pour th§ cream in a dish, and put tiie 



168 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

custard in the pan on the ice ; stir it until it becomes 
thick Uke jelly ; then add the cream carefully. It 
should look like light sponge cake before it is baked. 
Take sponge cake, called " ladies' fingers, " and put 
around the sides and bottom of a round tin pan ; pour 
the charlotte over it, and set on the ice until wanted. 
Then take a round dish or plate and turn out ; the bot- 
tom will be at the top, and no cake at the bottom. 

KASPBEKRY SPONGE. 

Dissolve three quarters of an ounce of isinglass in a 
little boiling water ; add a pint of new milk, half a pint 
of cream, half a pint of raspberry jelly, and the juice of

to cool, but not to set. Grate the rind of a lemon, and 
add the juice of the lemon, then half a pound of sugar; 
strain all into a bowl, and whisk them all together till 
they begin to stiffen. Then pour into a flat dish, and 
cut into squares. 

APPLE, OR GOOSEBERRY SOUFFLE. 

Scald the fruit and press it through a sieve ; then 
put it in a tart dish. When cold, pour a rich custard 
over it ; about two inches deep. Whip the whites of 
eggs, and lay it in rough pieces on the custard ; sift " 
white sugar over it ; then jDut in the oven for a short 
time. It makes a very handsome dish.

PLUM AND CHERRY CHARLOTTE. 

Take a quart of ripe plums, cherries, peaches, or 
any fruit you like j take the stones out, and stew them 



AND housekeeper's AID. 169 

with a pound of sugar. Cut slices of bread and but- 
ter ; then lay them round the sides and bottom of a 
deep dish. Pour on the fruit boiling hot ; cover it up 
and set away to cool. Serve with sweet cream. 

CHAKLOTTE DE RUSSE. 

Take one pint of milk ; add six eggs, and sugar to 
sweeten it. Strain into it an ounce of isinglass dis- 
solved in boiling water. Bake it, and let it cool ; then 
make a whijD, and mix with the custard, and cool in 
forms. Lay in the bottom of your dish slices of sponge 
cake alternately, with jelly around the dish. 

ICE CREAM. WO. 1. 

Take one quart of sweet milk, cream is best, two 
eggs, one tea-cupful of white sugar, one tea-spoonful 
of flour, wet with a little milk ; flavor with lemon, 
vanilla, strawberry, or orange. Put your milk in the 
freezer, and set in a kettle of boiling water, stirring it 
to prevent its burning ; then when it boils, stir in the 
egg, sugar, and flour, also the flavoring. Pound up 
the ice in small pieces, and put a layer of ice and of 
salt in your tub alternately around it. Stir the cream 
and loosen from the sides of the tub with a wooden 
spatula. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Take one quart of cream, one of milk, one pound of 
sugar ; put into your freezer, and put in boiling water 
as above; add lemon-peel while boiling. Stir in four 
eggs. Freeze as above. 

CHERRY ICE CREAM. 

Take cherries, mash and squeeze out the juice ; to 
every pint add one lemon, the juice only, and a pint> 
of cream ; freeze as above. Strawberries may be used 
in the same way. 

•WHIP CREAM. 

Take a pint and a half of cream, the whites of three 
eggs, the juice of one lemon, sugar to your taste, fla- 
vored with the grated rind of lemon or rose-water ; 
whip with a whisk or in a whip-churn, and as the foam 
8 



170 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

rises, lay it into jelly-glasses, or the glass may be half 
filled with jelly, and the whip poured over it. 

ANOTHER ICE CREAM. 

Take one quart of sweet cream, sweeten and flavor, 
whip to a light froth, skim off and put into your freez- 
er until all is whipped to a froth. It will freeze in less 
time, and be smoother than any other recipe. 

RHE]SriSH CREAM. 

An ounce and a half of isinglass, dissolved in boiling 
water. Strain through a sieve ; add eight eggs, half a 
pint of Rhenish wine or white wine, the juice and rind 
of two lemons grated, loaf-sugar to suit the taste. Let 
them boil slowly until thick ; then strain through mus- 
lin into china cups. 

LEMON CREAM. 

Take two eggs, a pint of thick cream, a cup of sugar, 
and the rind of a lemon, cut thin, boil it ; then stir 
until almost cold ; put the juice of the lemon in a dish 
and pour the cream over it, stirring until cold. Serve 
in custard-cups either alone or with sweetmeats. 
Leave out the whites of the egg. 

ICE CREAM. NO. 2. 

Take four quarts of milk, one quart of cream, eight 
eggs well beaten, one pound and a half of sugar, 
four large table-spoonfuls of wheat flour, or six even 
spoonfuls of arrow-root. Stir the eggs and sugar to- 
gether ; the flour stir smooth with a little milk. Put 
the milk in your freezer, set it in a kettle of water and 
let it boil. Then stir in the eggs, sugar, and flour ; 
beat well and let it cool. Flavor with any thing you 
like. Then freeze it. The patent freezer requires less 
ice than the other. Ice cream may be made without 
eggs if all cream is used, and well whisked before freez- 
ing. In that case it will not require boiling. 

S'WISS CREAM. 

Take a pint of cream, and the peel of one lemon, 
set over the fire until it boils ; the juice of a lemon, and 
a little flour beaten with it, mix with the cream, and 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 171 

boil a few minutes lono-er. Strain throug^h a sieve. 
Lay your cake in the dish and pour on the cream. It 
should be made the day before used. 

ANOTHER LEMON CREAM. 

Take a large spoonful of brandy, six ounces of loaf 
sugar, the peel and juice of two lemons, grate the peel, 
mix well, and add a pint of cream and whisk it up. 

ORAWGE CREAM. 

Take one cupful of powdered sugar, half a cup of 
water, two oranges, the rind grated ; add four well- 
beaten eggs, and beat together some time. Strain 
through a flannel into a saucepan ; set it over a gentle 
fire and stir it one way until scalding hot, but not 
boiling, or it will curdle. Serve as custard in jelly- 
glasses. 

BLAlSrCHED CREAM. 

Take a quart of rich cream, sweeten with loaf-sugar, 
boil it and beat the whites of twenty eggs with a lit- 
tle cold cream ; strain it, and when the cream is upon 
the boil, stir in the eggs ; then strain through a hair- 
sieve ; beat with a spoon until it is cold, then put in a 
dish.

Take four ounces of rice, two ounces of loaf-sugar, 
two ounces of butter, six ounces of the essence of al- 
monds, a quart of new milk. Boil fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Pour into a mould greased with Florence 
oil; turn out when cold, and serve with preserves 
around it. 

BURNT CREAM. 

Make a rich custard without sugar, put in grated 
lemon-peel ; when cold, sift sugar over it, and burn the 
top with a salamander. 

POMPADOUR CREAM. 

Beat the whites of six eggs to a froth with one 
spoonful of brandy ; sweeten to your taste ; stir 
over the fire two or three minutes ; pour into a dish ; 
then melt some butter or boil cream, and cover it. 



172 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

SWCW-BALLS. 

Beat the whites of six eggs to a froth ; sweeten to 
your taste ; flavor with rose-water. Drop a spoonful 
at a time in boiling Avater for, a minute or two. -Make 
a cream of milk, eggs, and sugar, to float them in. 

PLOATIlSra ISLATJ-D. 

Take the white of an egg^ beat to a froth ; add a 
glass of currant-jelly ; beat together until a spoon will 
stand up in it. Drop a spoonful at a time on a glass 
bowl of sweet cream. 

FLOATING ISLAND. NO. 2. ANOTHEK TV AY. 

Sweeten a pint of thick cream with loaf-sugar ; add 
a gill of wine, the grated rind of a lemon ; whisk to a 
froth ; then pour a pint of cream in a dish, take a 
French roll, slice it, and lay over the cream as lightly 
as possible ; then a layer of calves' feet jelly or currant, 
then whip your cream, and lay on the froth as high as 
you can, and what remains, pour into the bottom of 
the dish. Garnish the rim with sweetmeats. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Beat the whites of three eggs, three table-spoonfuls 
of raspberry jam, or red currant-jelly. When the 
whole will stand in rocky forms, pour it upon apple- 
jelly or cream beaten up with wine, sugar, and grated 
lemon-peel. 

TO "WHIP CREAM. 

Sweeten a bowl of cream, and flavor with any juicy 
fruit ; such as orange, lemon, etc., by rubbing sugar on 
the peel ; set another bowl near with a sieve over it ; 
then whip the cream, and as it rises in a froth, skim it 
oflT and put in the sieve to drain ; whip the cream that 
drains off", and when done, ornament with lemon rasp- 
ings. This cream may be used before it is set, upon 
custard, trifle, or syllabub. 

A TRIFLE. 

Whip cream, as above, adding a little brandy or 
wine ; lay in a glass dish sponge cake, ratafia cakes, and 



AND housekeeper's AID. 173 

macaroons, and pour upon them as mncli brandy and 
sweet wine as they will soak ; then a rich custard about 
two inclies deep, with a little lemon-peel and grated 
nutmeg; then a layer of currant-jelly or raspberry jam, 
and upon the whole a high whip. A triHe should be 
made the day before used. 

CAKE TRIFLE. 

Cut out a rice or diet-bread cake about two incaes 
from the edge ; fill with custard, a few blanched and 
split almonds, and pieces of raspberry jam, and put on 
the whole a high w^hip. 

PRESERVES AND SWEETMEATS. 

Almost all kinds of fruit require a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit, except citron, which can be preserved 
with less. White sugar is more delicate for sweetmeats, 
and is more profitable to use than brown. It does not 
waste so much m clarifying, although nice brown sugar 
will answer very well for some kinds. The West-India 
sugar-house syrup is nice for preserving as it will not 
ferrnent. A preserving-kettle lined with porcelain is 
the best thing to preserve in, but any thing else will 
answer except iron ; if brass is used, it should be kept 
perfectly clean, and the preserves poured out as soon 
as done. I think fruit retains its color and flavor bet- 
ter by boiling quick than by a slow process. Fruits 
should be put in the syrup when it is cold. If the syrup 
is rich, the fruit will be hard ; take it up before they 
break. A wooden paddle is better for stirring than a 
silver spoon, which should only be used for skimming. 
The scum may be strained through a bit of muslin or 
jelly-bag, that there may be no waste, and then turned 
back again, the scum remaining in the bag. Fruit is 
nicer "by being boiled a short time, but will not keep as 
long as if boUed longer. It is better to keep sweet- 
meats in small jars, just what you would use at one 
time ; glass keeps them better than any thing else. 
Brown stone or earthenware will answer, but shoiild 
never be used for any thing else. After they are put in, 
they should not be moved until cold ; then wet a paper 



1 74 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

m brandy and coA^er the lop of the sweetmeats with it, 
or pour on a little brandy. It will not injure the taste 
at all. They should be kept in a dry, cool place. Brown 
blotting-paper wet Avith the Avhite of an egg and placed 
OA'er the jars ; when dry, put on another j^aper cover. 
A jelly-bag is made of a piece of flannel, half a square, 
and scAved on one side, the two corners together, bound 
with a piece of tape, and four loops sewed on to hang 
it by. PreserA'ing-kettles should be broad, and the fla\^or 
of the fruit is preserved by coA''ering the kettle. 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR. 

AlloAV the beaten white of an egg to every four 
pounds of sugar, and a pint of Avater. Put your sugar 
in your preserving-kettle, pour in the water and egg, 
set it where it will gradually warm, stirring occasion- 
ally until it boils ; then skim it, and pour in a gill of 
cold water, and when it boils skim again. Take from 
the fire, and let it stand a fcAV minutes ; then put over 
again and boil, and continue doing so until the syrup 
is clear, and as often as any scum arises take off. If 
Avanted to candy, boil until sufficiently thick, AA'hich can 
be ascertained by dropping some in cold water ; if it is 
brittle and snaps, it is done. Then put in the fruit and 
preserA^e. Wliite sugar does not require clarifying ; it 
is therefore the least trouble as well as cheapest to use. 

APPLES. 

Pare them, and if A'-ery large, hah^e or quarter ; if not, 
take out the core, leaA'ing the apple AAdiole. For six 
pounds of apples alloAV four of sugar. Make your syrup 
and let it cool, then add the apples and heat sloAAdy at 
first ; boil until they are clear and tender. When cool, 
add the extract of lemon, or slice up a fresh lemon, and 
put in a layer of lemon and a layer of apples. 

BAKED APPLES. 

They may be pared and the core taken out and the 
apples filled Avith sugar, and put in a tin pan with a 
little Avater in, and if you like, a bit of cinnamon, may 
be added. Bake until soft. They arc nice baked Avith 
the skins on, and sliced up when done, and eaten Avith 
sujxar and cream. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 175 

CRAB-APPLES. 

Make a syrup of equal weio'lit of apples and sugar. 
Simmer tlie apples in water until the skins come off 
easily ; then take up and take out the core with a cutter 
or sharp knife. Boil in the syrup until tender ; then 
take them up, and spread on dishes to cool ; then place 
them in jars and pour the syrup over them. 

PINE-APPLES. 

Take those that are fully ripe and fresh ; take off the 
rind, and cut in slices half an inch thick. Allow equal 
weights of white sugar, and make a layer of fruit, then 
a layer of sugar, until all are in, and let them remain 
until next day ; then pour off the syrup and add a pint 
of water if four pounds are preserved ; boil a few min- 
utes, then take from the fire. When cool, put in the 
pine-apples, and boil until tender. Put in a deej^ dish 
and let them remain several days ; then scald up the 
syrup and pour on the fruit while hot. When cold, put 
in glass jars and seal up tight. They retain their flavor 
better if not boiled, but are liable to ferment unless 
kej)t in a box of dry sand. They are nice canned. 

PINE-APPLE MARMALADE. 

Take off the rind and grate them, leaving out the core 
in the center ; add an equal w^eight of sugar. When 
the juice begins to run so as to form a syrup, then set 
it on the fire and heat slowly, stirring often to prevent 
its burning. Let it simmer half an hour, then cool a 
little, and if it cuts smooth it is done. 

CRAB-APPLE MARMALADE. 

Boil them in just water enough to prevent their burn- 
ing ; keep them covered. When soft, strain and add an 
equal quantity of sugar. Put over a slow fire, and stir 
constantly until thick. Try a little by letting it cool 
before taking off; when done it will cut smooth. 

APPLE MARMALADE. 

Take tAventy pounds of pared and quartered apples. 
Make a syrup of ten 230unds of sugar, then put in the 
apples when the syrup is cold and boil until tender ; 



176 • EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

take them out and mash fine ; cut six oranges into 

small slices, and boil all together, stirring all the time 

until done. 

STKA^WBERRIES. 

Take ripe strawberries, but not so ripe as to be soft. 
Hull them and take equal quantities of sugar and ber- 
ries. Put a layer of berries and a layer of sugar, and 
so on until all are in. Preserve only a few at a time, 
for if crowded they will not look well. Let them re- 
main an hour or two to let the juice settle at the bot- 
tom ; then put over a moderate fire, and when preserved 
put in glass or china jars, not large ones, seal tight, 
keep in sand ; a small plate or a piece of a broken i^late 
may be put on top to keep the fruit under the syrup. 
A little brandy may be put on top. They retain their 
natural flavor best if not cooked. This can be done by 
allowing a little more sugar than berries, and putting 
the berries in glass jars, first a layer of berries, then of 
sugar, and so on. Cork tight and keep in a box of sand. 
They are more difficult to keep in this way. 

APKICOTS. 

Scald them to take the skin ofi"; cut in half and ex- 
tract the stones. Boil in a little water ; then take their 
weight in sugar and add the liquor in which they Avere 
boiled ; boil gently and skim well. When it comes to 
a jelly, take them up. Put in jars, and cover with paper. 

PEACHES. 

Take those that are not fully ripe, pare them and take 
out the stones after halving. Take equal quantities of 
peaches and sugar. Put the sugar on the peaches ; let 
it remain over night. In the morning skim out the 
peaches and heat the syrup ; take ofi" the scum, let it 
cool ; then put in the peaches and heat up ; when done 
put in jars. If you like, crack the ^^its and put in a few 
peach meats. In the course of a few days scald the 
syrup and turn back. When cold, put a btandy paper 
on top. 

PEACHES IN BRANDY. 

Gather them while quite hard ; rub witli a bit of flan- 
nelj and prick \\dth a needle. Take half a pound of 



A.ND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. HI 

suo-ar to one of peaches, and make a syrup ; then boil 
the peaches until quite tender, but not to break, ihen 
take the peaches out of the syrup and lay on platters 
Take a pint of brandy to every pint of the liquor, and 
turn it while hot on to the peaches. When cold, put m 
jars and seal up ; keep in a cool place. Other kmds 
of fruit may be done in the same way. 

PEACH JAM. 

Pare and halve, then take out the stones, lay them in 
a pan with a layer of sugar, then of peaches, alternately, 
allowing three quarters of a pound to a pound ol truit. 
Let them remain a few hours, then put m a preserving- 
kettle and stew, frequently stirring to prevent their 
burning on the bottom ; no water is necessary, ihey 
retain their flavor done in this way. 

PEARS. 

Pears look nice whole if not too large. Pare, leaving 
the stems on. Make a thin syrup and boil them tender 
but not to break. Let them lie in the syrup two days, 
then drain and add more sugar to the liquor, and boil 
ten minutes ; skim and put in the pears, and simmer 
until transparent. Then take out and put a clove or a 
cassia bud into the end of each. Lay m a jar when 
cool Then pour the warm syrup over them and add 
more sugar ; then simmer half an hour. Weigh your 
suo-ar at first and allow three quarters of a pound to 
one of pears. They are very nice baked m molasses. 
CURRANT MARMALADE. 
Take ripe currants and squeeze out the juice of part 
of them ; then add the same quantity of red raspberry 
juice Put Avith the whole currants and boil gently. 
When they begin to boil, put in an equal weight ol 
sucrar boiled to a candy height ; boil and mash them, 
skfm as fast as any thing rises, and when thick as mar- 
malade put in jars. 

CURRANTS. 
Take them when ripe, pick them over, and Avash thein 
in cold water. Let them drain well ; then put equal 
8* 



178 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

quantities of sugar and frnit. Make a syrup, and when 
cool add the currants and cook gently a few minutes. 
After a few days, if they are not jelly, heat the liquor 
and pour on again. They are nice preserved green. 
Currants may be j^reserved by j^utting half raisins and 
half currants. 

BRANDY PEARS. 

Take pears that are ripe but not soft. Simmer in a 
little water until they yield to the pressure of the fin- 
ger ; then take them out and put in cold water. Pare 
them and make a syrup of three pounds of sugar to one 
of pears, and a cupful of water to each pound of sugar. 
When the syrup is clear, put in the pears while hot ; 
boil until they look clear and the syrup is rich. Put in 
a glass jar and boil the syrup thick ; mix a gill of 
brandy to one pint of syrup ; pour over the fruit, and 
when cold put a paper on tojJ. 

QUINCES. 

Select the nicest and best ones, for the inferior ones 
can be used for jelly or marmalade. Pare and quarter 
or cut in rings, taking out all the core. Boil until tender 
in water ; then put in a jar and let them remain until the 
next day. Boil the skins and cores in a little water, and 
strain miless jelly is to be made ; if it is, reserve them 
for that, adding a few quarters to give a better flavor. 
Then add the water in which they were boiled the day 
before, and allow a pound of sugar to each pound of 
quinces. (It is well to weigh the quinces before cook- 
ing them.) Let it boil a few minutes, and skim ; then 
remove from the fire and when cool put in the quinces. 
If not water sufficient, add more, for if too rich they 
will shrink and be hard. Boil until a fork will easily 
go through them. Keep them covered while cooking 
to make them light-colored. Take them out with a 
skimmer, and lay in a jar. Boil down the syrup until 
just enough to cover them, and when cold it will be a 
nice jelly. They may be preserved with apples by add- 
ing one tliird apples, the same size as the quinces, which 
must be cooked in the syrup first and put in the bottom 
of the jar, as they will not require so much cooking as 
the quinces. 



AND housekeeper's AID. llO 

QUI]>J'CES ^WITH MOLASSES. 

After paring and quartering them, boil the skins and 
cores in new cider, then strain them. For five pounds 
of quince take a pound of brown sugar, one quart of 
molasses, and the cider in which the skins have been 
boiled ; add the whites of two eggs and clarify. When 
cool, add the quinces, and boil until tender ; add more 
cider if necessary. Spice with orange-peel or ginger- 
root. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

Wash and quarter the quinces, then boil in water 
until perfectly soft. The parings and cores which have 
been left after preserving may be added ; then strain 
and add as much sugar, pound for pound ; stew gently, 
stirring constantly to prevent its burning. In the 
course of an hour take it up. If it cuts smooth w^hen 
cold, it is done. Put into deep dishes that it may be 
cut in slices. 

PLUMS. 

The richest plum for preserving is the damson. Make 
a syrup of brown sugar, pound for pound, clarify it, and 
when boiling hot pour over the plums. Let them re- 
main two days ; then drain off and boil again. Skim 
well and pour it over them again ; let them remain two 
more days, and then put them in the kettle and boil 
until rich. 

TO PKESERVE PLUMS 'WITHOUT THE SKINS. 

Pour boiling w^ater over the large egg plum, and cover 
up until cold, when the skins will easily come off. Then 
make a syrup of a pound of sugar and a tea-cupful of 
water to a pound of pUims ; boil it and pour over and 
let them remain two days and boil again ; then do them 
as in the former directions. 

TO PRESERVE GREEN GAGES, 

Loaf-sugar should be used for gages, pound for pound. 
Prick tliem with a large needle at the top and bottom. 
Make the syrup and just water enougli to cover them ; 
then boil live minutes. Put them in deep dishes and 
let them remain until the next day ; then drain them 



180 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

and boil the syrup and ]30ur on again ; continue this 
until the fifth time, then boil the plums a few minutes 
and put in jars. Care must be taken not to break them. 

PLUM JAM. 

Boil in Avater until tender ; then rub through a sieve, 
and to erery pint add a pound of sugar, and make as 
marmalade ; then put in tumblers as directed for jelly. 

CHEHKIES OR SMALL PLUMS. 

Make a syrup, pound for pound, adding a little water, 
and boil the fruit a few minutes ; then take out with a 
skimmer, and boil the syrup down rich, and pour on 
hot. If you wish to preserve them without the pits, 
take them out carefully, saving the juice. Put in small 
jars when cold, and seal tight. 

CITRON" AND ^^ATERMELON RINDS. 

Cut in squares about an inch long, boil a few minutes 
in alum-water, then drain after rinsing in cold water. 
Make a syrup of equal weight of white sugar ; boil until 
clear. When cool, add a little essence of ginger, or what 
is better, when the ^^reserves are to be used, add a little 
extract of lemon, or if preferred, put in the jar oil of 
lemon. 

GRAPES. 

Boil them in a syrup of an equal weight of sugar ; if 
large, extract the seeds by halving them. If ripe, 
squeeze out the pulp, boil soft and strain it ; add an 
equal weight of sugar, and boil until thick. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

Allow three quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound 
of berries. Mix the sugar and berries ; mash them and 
lot them remain awhile ; then boil, stirring all the time 
to prevent its burning. Another way is to add a pint 
of currant-juice to every five pounds of berries, and an 
extra pound of sugar. 

TOMATOES. 

Take the straw-colored, turn on boiling water to take 
off the skins j then weigh them and put equal quantities 



AND housekeeper's AID. 181 

of sugar, and let it remain on all night. In the morn- 
ing drain them and boil the syrnp, removing the scnm ; 
put in the tomatoes and boil twenty minutes ; take them 
out and boil the syrup until thick enough. When cool, 
slice lemon or oranges and lay between them in a jar ; 
then pour the syru]) over them and tie up. 

TOMATO JAM. 

Take off the skins and mash fine, adding an equal 
weight of sugar, and heat gradually until thick ; or they 
may be washed clean and put in a preserving-kettle, 
covering it tight, and stew until soft ; then strain 
through a colander, and add sugar ; then heat on the 
fire, stirring constantly until done. Ginger essence or 
lemon may be added. 

TOMATO FIGS. 

After taking off the skins, weigh them and add an 
equal weight of sugar ; let them stand two days ; then 
boil the syrup and skim well ; pour over the tomatoes 
and let them stand two days longer. The third time 
pouring on, dry them either in the sun or oven. When 
perfectly dry, pack them in boxes with a layer of sugar 
between. The syrup may be used for other purposes. 

BARBERRIES 

may be preserved like currants, or if preserved in mo- 
lasses they will soon lose the molasses taste. The small 
winter grape may be preserved in the same way. 

CRANBERRIES. 

Allow pound for pound, equal weight ; make the 
syrup and boil until transparent, or to a peck allow 
two pounds of brown sugar and half a pint of molasses ; 
clarify and boil until transparent. For marmalade make 
as others, except the quantity of sugar ; add a pound 
and a half to a pound of cranberries. 

CUCUMBERS. 

Take large ripe cucumbers ; pare and take out the 
seeds, cut in pieces one inch square, put in salt and 
water that will bear up an egg ; let them remain three 



182 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

days. Wash them and put into cold water with a lump 
of alum, and boil until tender ; then drain and make a 
syrup, allowing equal weights of sugar and cucumbers, 
and when cool put in and boil until clear. They may 
be j)reserved the same as citron, and can scarcely be 
known from them. Flavor with any thing you like. 

PRUNES. 

Boil until they swell out plump ; then add sugar, half 
a pound to a pound of prunes ; cover tight while boil- 
ing ; add lemon sliced up if you like. When taken 
from the fire add a wine-glassful of wine. 

BLACK CURRANTS. 

Take off the ends with a pair of scissors, and allow 
little over a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; half a 
pint of red currant-juice to a pound is nice ; put all into 
a preserving-kettle and boil, carefully skimming it ; let 
it boil fifteen minutes. They are nice for tarts. 

GOOSEBERRRIES. 

Take off the blossoms and stems, and if not smooth 
roll in a cloth until they are, and for each quart take a 
pound of sugar and a gill of water ; make a syrup and 
put in the fruit ; boil fifteen minutes, and put in jars 
w^hen cold. Keep for tarts and pies. 

RHUBARB JAM. 

Wipe the stalks clean, not wash them ; peel off the 
skin, and cut up ; a pound of sugar to a pound of plant 
must' be allowed ; stew until tender. It must be slowly 
stewed or the flavor will be lost. 

TO BOTTLE FRUIT. 

Take any kind of fruit and put in bottles ; fill up full 
and put cold water in a kettle, with straw at the bot- 
tom, and while heating, cork and seal up tight. Put in 
a cool place and they will keep a long time. A better 
way is to cork up, leaving a small aperture in the cork 
for the heated air to escape ; then seal. They should 
boil twenty minutes before sealing. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 183 

CANNING FRUIT. 

Canning fruit is preferable to preserving, as the fruit 
retains its natural flavor, and does not require half the 
sugar. Glass cans are best, but almost any other kind 
will answer, tin or earthen jars. After filling they must 
be put into cold water in a kettle and heated gradually, 
leaving a hole in the top to allow the air to escape, and 
when boiling, fill up the aperture with a mixture of 
beeswax and rosin. They must be put in a cool place. 

CANNING TOMATOES. 

Pour on hot water to take off the skins ; then cook 
the same as for eating, adding a little salt, and fill up 
your cans ; if properly sealed, they will keep any length 
of time. Green corn, peas, or any kind of vegetables 
may be canned successfully. 

TO CAN PEACHES. 

Take half a pound of sugar to one pound of peaches. 
Make a syrup as directed ; add half a pint of water to 
every pound of sugar. Pare the peaches and drop into 
the syrup ; boil ten minutes. Put into the cans and 
seal up. Any other kind of fruit may be preserved in 
the same way. They will keep equally as well without 
sugar as with. 

APPLE BUTTER. 

Take from six to eight gallons of cider to one bushel 
of apples ; boil down one half; then put in the apples, 
having them previously pared and cored, and boil down 
thick ; add spices if you like, and sugar if the apples 
are tart ; half sweet and half sour apples are the best. 
Boil the sweet ones first, as it will take longer to boil 
them tender. Any kind of berry may be made as well 
as apples, but they will not require any cider, but use 
half a pound of sugar to one pound of apples or berries. 

PRESERVED PUMPKIN. 

Cut pumpkin of a nice flavor and fully ripe ; pare and 
cut in pieces the third of an inch thick. Take equal 
weight in white sugar. Allow a gill of lemon-juice to 
four pounds of pumpkin, or the juice of one lemon to a 



184 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

pound. Put the pumpkin in a pan with the sugar and 
juice, and let it remain all night. In the morning put 
into a preserving-kettle and cook till clear ; be careful 
to skim well ; then add some lemon-peel cut in small 
pieces. Take out and strain the syrup through a jelly- 
bag and pour on. 

FROSTED FRUIT. 

Dip any kind of fruit into the beaten whites of eggs, 
then in fine white sugar ; put on a tin to dry, set in a 
warm oven. When dry, put in a dry place. 

TO PRESERVE FRUIT BY DRYING. 

Take strawberries, blackberries, or raspberries, and 
allow half a pound of sugar to a pound of berries, and 
dry in an oven. I think they retain their flavor better 
than drying in the sun. Put in jars and seal up tight. 
These are nice for pies or puddings in the winter when 
nothing else can be obtained. Any kind of fruit can be 
kept a long time by drying perfectly and putting in a 
bag and hanging in a dry place. They must be well 
dried or else' they will breed worms, and should be im- 
mediately heated over. 

TO MAKE MOLASSES CAISTDY. 

The West-India molasses is best for this purpose. 
Take one quart, and half a pound of brown sugar, boil 
until it will crisp when cold. Care should be taken not 
to have it burn ; when nearly done, add the juice of one 
lemon ; do not put in too soon or the taste will boil 
out. When done, jDOur on to a buttered tin. If nut- 
meats are put in, they should be put in while warm. 
Take some out of the pan and pull with your hands 
until of a light color ; the more it is worked the whiter 
it will be. 

JELLY 

may be made of almost any kind of fruits mashed and 
strained through a jelly-bag, allowing a pound of sugar 
to every pint of juice. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Take currants, not too ripe, or the jelly will not be 
as good a color ; just after they have turned red is the 



AND housekeeper's AID. 185 

best time. Pick them over «ind wash them clean ; then 
mash them, and squeeze tliera in a bag, or put them in 
a jar and set it in a kettle of cold water and put on the 
fire, and when hot strain through a bag. To every pint 
add a pound of juice, and boil ten minutes ; skim well 
and pour into tumblers set in cold water ; let it cool 
a few minutes before putting in or they will break. 
When cool, paste tissue paper on top, and set in a dry 
place. A more delicate jelly is made without boiling. 
Masli the currants and put a pound of sugar to a pint 
of juice. Put in glasses and paste over ; then set in 
the sun a few days, and it will be a nice jelly. 

PEACH JELLY. 

Take a dozen peaches, cut in halves, take out the 
pits and peel them. Take a pint of clarified sugar and 
w^ater, (as given before ;) when it has boiled and been 
skimmed, put in the peaches, with the kernels broken ; 
boil gently for ten minutes ; then take out four or five 
of the halves for garnishing the jelly; let the rest boil 
a few minutes longer. Take three lemons, cut off the 
rinds, and squeeze the juice through a sieve into a basin ; 
pass the syrup through with half an ounce of isinglass ; 
run through three times. Fill your moulds half-full of 
jelly, and when set put in the peaches, and a little more 
jelly, and when that is set fill up the. mould. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Pippins or crab-apples are best for jelly, although 
any tart apples will answer. Put on water sufficient 
to cover them ; boil until tender ; then strain through 
a bag, and make as currant jelly. They are nicer boiled 
with the skins on, but take out the cores. If the jelly 
is too pale a color, it may be colored with spinach-juice 
for green, or for pink use cochineal. Quince jelly may. 
be made in the same way ; add lemon-juice. 

CALVES' EEET JELLY. 

Take four feet, slit them in two, and wash them 
clean ; then put them in water sufficient to cover them ; 
boil several hours, or until reduced to two quarts. 
Strain it through a sieve ; then let it remain until cold, 



186 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

when all the fat must be taken off, and the sediment at 
the bottom taken off. Put in a preserving-kettle and 
melt slowly; add the juice and grated rind of two 
lemons. Wash six eggs clean, and beat the whites and 
shells together and mix with the jelly. Sweeten to the 
taste with loaf-sugar ; add half a pint of white wine or 
Madeira. Boil slowly fifteen minutes, and then strain 
through a jelly-bag until clear ; if not clear at first, run 
it through again. If not sufiiciently stiff, add half an 
ounce of isinglass. Flavor with any sjoices you like, or 
color if desired. It must be kept in a cool place or sur- 
rounded by ice. Ox-heel may be made in this way, or 
sheep's feet ; also pigs' feet make nice jelly. 

STKAWBERRY JELLY. 

Put them in a pan and bruise well, adding a little 
water and powdered sugar ; in an hour or two strain 
through a jelly-bag with isinglass dissolved in half a 
pint of cold water ; mix well and pour into moulds. 
Raspberry, blackberry, or almost any other kind of 
fruit may be made in the same way. If cherries are 
used, they must be boiled, and the juice of lemons 
added. 

COLORING FOR JELLIES OR CREAMS. 

The juice of spinach-leaves bruised will give a green 
color, and saftVon will make a yellow hue. For color- 
ing pink use cochineal. Bruise it with a knife-blade ; 
then put in a little white brandy, and let it remain 
awhile ; then strain it. This is for immediate use. An- 
other method is to take fifteen grains of cochineal and 
reduce to a powder ; add a tea-spoonful of cream of 
tartar, and boil an hour in half a pint of water ; add 
a bit of alum the size of a pea. 

FRUIT IN JELLY. 
Put half a pint of calves' foot jelly in a basin, and 
when it has become stiff" lay in a bunch of grapes or cur- 
rants, with the stems upward ; put a few vines over and 
fill up with Avarm jelly ; then set it away until next day, 
and then set the basin in hot water for a moment ; then 
turn out carefully. It is an elegant looking dish 



AND housekeeper's AID. 187 

STKA"WBERRIES FOR CREAM. 

Take equal weiglit of sugar and berries, mash until 
perfectly smooth. Put in jars and j)aste paper over. 
It will kee}^ good for several months. 

STRA^VBERRY TART. 

Take two- quarts of ripe strawberries ; add a pint of 
wine, half a pint of clarified sugar — it must be cold — 
the juice of two lemons ; mix these without breaking 
the berries, and put in a puff-paste, previously baked. 

STRAWBERRIES SOUFFLE. 

Pick over two quarts of ripe berries ; rub them 
through a sieve ; add a pound of white sugar and the 
whites of six eggs beat to a froth ; mix as light as pos- 
sible, and bake in a moderate oven ; when done, glaze 
on top. 

PRESERVED CURRANTS FOR PUDDINGS. 

Take three pounds of brown sugar, and put in six 
pounds of currants well j^icked over and washed ; just 
let them boil up, and then pour into a jar. Wet a paper 
with brandy, and when cool j^ut on top ; cover tight 
and set in a cool place, or they may be put on plates 
and dried. 

STRAWBERRIES DRIED IN SUGAR. 

Pick them over, and take a quarter of a pound of 
sugar to four of strawberries ; dry in a warm OA^en 
after bread has been taken out. Any other kind of 
fruit may be dried in the «ame way. 

PICKLED BLACKBERRIES. 

Take seven pounds of ripe berries ; add one pint of 
weak vinegar and tln*ee pounds of sugar. Only let 
them boil up once ; then put in jars. They are ex- 
cellent. 

TO PRESERVE CURRANTS WITH THE STEMS ON. 

Pick them with the stems on ; melt some brown 
sugar in a kettle — one pound to a pailful of currants 
will be enougli ; keep the kettle on the stove, and im- 
merse the currants in tlie sugar, as many as you can at 
a time ; then take out with a skimmer and spread on a 



188 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

board to dry in tlie sun. Then i^lace them in an oven 
a short time to prevent their getting wormy. Put in 
a bag and hang in a dry, cool pkice. The liquor in 
which they were boiled can be made into wine or jelly. 

ESSEI^CE OF NUTMEG. 

Dissolve an ounce of the essential oil of -nutmeg in a 
j^int of rectified spirits. Use for flavoring cakes and 
jiuddings. 

ESSENCE OP GINGER. 

Grate three ounces of race ginger and put in a quart 
of good brandy ; take the yellow part of a fresh lemon 
and put in. Bottle up, and shake well every day for 
eight or ten days. It is nice for flavoring sweetmeats, 
and a little mixed with water answers for ginger tea. 

EXTRACT OF LEMON AND ORANGE. 

Rub the yellow 23art of the rind with lump-sugar, 
and as fast as the sugar becomes saturated wdth the oil 
put in a china bowl or jar ; press down tight and cover 
close. A very little answers for flavoring. 

ORANGE SYRUP. 

Squeeze the juice through a sieve, and to every pint 
add a pound and a half of sugar ; boil it slowly and 
skim well; when cold, bottle it tight. This is nice 
added to a butter sauce for pudding ; it is also nice for 
custards or punch. Lemons may be done the same 
way. If not likely to keep, scald and skim again. 

SPICE BRANDY. 

Put rose-leaves into brandy, steej) until the strength 
is obtained, then drain and squeeze the rose-leaves, and 
add more, and continue to do so until it is fully impreg- 
nated with the flavor ; cork tight. Peach meats steeped 
in brandy are nice to flavor puddings, pies, etc. 

BLACKBERRRY SYRUP. NO. 1. 

Take the high vine blackberries, as the low ones 
do not possess the medicinal virtues that the high ones 
do ; set the berries on the fire and mash them, and 
strain through a flannel bag ; to each pint put a pound 



AND housekeeper's AID. 189 

of loaf-sugar, a tea-spoonful of cloves, an ounce of mace, 
and an ounce of cinnamon pounded fine ; boil the whole 
together fifteen minutes ; strain again, and to every 
pint add a glass of French brandy ; cork tight in bot- 
tles and keep in a cool place. This is an excellent 
remedy for the bowel complaint. 

BLACKBERBY SYBUP. WO. 2. 

To two quarts of juice add one pound of loaf-sugar, 
half an ounce of nutmeg, half an ounce of cinnamon, a 
quarter of an ounce of cloves, the same of allspice ; boil 
a short time, and when cold add a pint of French 
brandy. 

ELDEBBERBY SYBUP. 

Wash and mash them, then squeeze out the juice; 
to each pint of juice put a pint of molasses ; boil twen- 
ty minutes, stirring all the time ; when cold, add four 
table-spoonfuls of brandy to each quart ; bottle and 
cork it tight. This is an excellent remedy fot a tight 
cough. 

LEMON JELLY. 

Take half a dozen lemons, squeeze out the juice, put 
the rinds over a slow fire with an ounce of isinglass 
and a pint of boiling water ; when the isinglass is dis- 
solved, add the juice and sweeten to the taste with loaf- 
sugar ; boil a moment, then color it with any thing you 
like, and pass through a jelly-bag without expressing ; 
fill your glasses and paste over. Orange jelly may be 
made in the same way. 

^V^IWE JELLY. 

Take a pint of wine, the same of water, and boil ; 
then add two ounces of isinglass, previously dissolved 
in a little water ; pour in while boiling, and sweeten to 
the taste. Put in your glasses. 

ISINGLASS JELLY. 

Boil tAVO quarts of water with a quarter of a pound 
of isinglass, put some lemon-peel in a basin and strain 
the liquor on it, with four cloves, or more if you like, 
and half a pound of sugar ; let it remain where it will 



190 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

keep warm an hour or more, then take out the lemon- 
peel and cloves, and add two wine-glasses of brandy. 
This is nice for parties. 

TO PKESERVE LEMON JUICE. 

Squeeze and strain the juice into a dish, and add a 
pound of loaf-sugar to every pint of juice, and stir un- 
til dissolved, then bottle and seal up, or tie bladders 
over it, and keep in a cool place. 

A SUBSTITUTE EOK FRESH LEMONS. 

Take one ounce of the best oil of lemon, and strong 
rectified spirits four ounces ; put in a bottle and add 
the spirits by degrees, until it cuts the oil. This pos- 
sesses all the fragrance and flavor of the freshest lemon- 
peel. 

LEMON PICKLE. 
Take six lemons, quarter and take out the seeds, put 
them in a jar and sprinkle on two ounces of salt ; let it 
remain three days, well covered, then add nutmegs 
sliced, cloves, mace, and mustard-seed ; boil a quart of 
vinegar and pour over the ingredients ; cork tight, and 
it will be fit for use in a week. It is an improvement 
to most sauces, particularly to fish sauce. 

QUINCES PRESERVED "WHITE. 

Pare and core them, then strew powdered sugar over 
them, filling up the hole, add a small quantity of water 
at first, then more, and boil quickly ; when tender and 
clear, they are done. 

PUFFS OF PRESERVED FRUIT. 

Roll out good puff-paste, a quarter of an inch thick, 
and cut in squares, about four inches ; lay jam of any 
kind on each one, double them over, and cut in hali- 
moons with a tin cutter ; lay them on paper on a bak- 
ing plate, ice them, and bake in a slow oven from fif- 
teen to twenty minutes, taking care not to color the 
icing. 

TO KEEP GRAPES IN BRANDY. 

Take close bunches, not over ripe, put them in ajar, 
and sprinkle a good quantity of white sugar over them ; 



AND housekeeper's AID. 191 

fill up with brandy. Tie down with a bladder, and 
keep in a dry place. Prick each grape before laying- 
do Avn. 

. TRANSPARENT CRUST TOR TARTS. 
Take twelve ounces of butter, well washed and with- 
out salt, melted without being oiled ; when cool, add 
one well-beaten egg, and stir into a pound of dried 
flour ; make the paste very thin, line the patty-pans 
quickly, and when putting the tarts into the oven, brush 
them over with water and sift sugar over them. 

PEACHES IN BRANDY. NO. 2. 

Put them in a preserving-pan with cold water on 
them, let them simmer slowly ; when they begin to be 
soft, they are done ; then drain on a sieve ; they will not 
all be done at the same time, but must be taken out one 
at a time ; wipe dry, and when cold put in glasses, dis- 
solve powdered sugar in brandy, and fill up. 

TO CANDY FRUIT. 

Make a syrup of sugar, dip in the fruit quickly, then 
lay on a sieve aiid immerse in hot water, to take off the 
syrup ; put it on a napkin before the fire to dry, and 
repeat the process ; sift over the fruit double-refined 
sugar on all sides, till quite white, then place them on 
the shallow part of the sieve and place in an oven to 
dry, turn two or three times while drying ; be careful 
not to scorch them ; do not allow them to get cold till 
dry. 

PINE-APPLE TARTS. 

Pare a large pine-apple and take out the core, cut it 
in strips, mix with sugar, and let it stand till there is 
sufficient juice to stew it, and when stewed quite soft 
mash it with a spoon and let it cool ; then mix half a 
pint of cream and fill your shells with it ; grate sugar 
on top. 

PLUMS IN BRANDY. 

Take plums not too ripe, twelve pounds ; prick them 
and put in cold water over the fire ; when the water 
boils, skim out carefully and put them in a pan of cold 
water ; clarify three pounds of sugar ; put the plums 



192 EXCELSIOK COOK BOOK 

in and boil up ; let them remain two days ; then drain 
off and boil the syrup alone ; then boil up the plums, 
and the next day drain them and put in bottles ; then 
boil the syrup down more, and Avhen cold add sufficient 
brandy to cover the fruit ; stir well and strain ; then 
pour the syrup over the plums. Cork the bottles tight. 

CANDIED PLUMS. 

Cut them in halves and take out the stones ; lay them 
on a shallow dish ; sprinkle sugar over them and set 
them into a warm oven an hour ; take them out and 
spread on plates to dry. Other fruits may be done in 
this way. 

TO PBEPAKE ANY KIND OF FRUIT FOR BRANDY. 

Take the quantity desired, gathered before they are 
perfectly ripe ; prick them and lay them in cold water 
and set over the fire, keeping the water nearly boiling 
till the fruit will give to the touch ; then skim out care- 
fully and put into cold water ; drain off and add more 
cold water ; when perfectly cold, put in bottles ; if any 
is broken, do not put it in. Have a sufficient quantity 
of clarified sugar ready ; put double its quantity of 
brandy together ;. mix well and pour over the fruit. 
Seal up. 

BLACK BUTTER. 

To one pound of sugar put three pounds of any kind 
of fruit, currants, raspberries, cherries, etc. ; stew till 
thick. Nice for children. 

TO PREPARE FRUIT FOR CHILDREN. 

Take sliced apples, plums, cherries, currants, or any 
kind of ripe fruit ; put a layer in a stone jar with a 
layer of sugar ; set it in a saucepan of water, and let 
it remain till done. Eat with bread or rice. 

ICING FOR TARTS. 

Beat the white of an egg till light ; wash the tarts over 
with it, using a feather ; then sift powdered sugar over. 

PINE-APPLES "WITHOUT PRESERVING. 

Take those that are fully ripe ; pare off the rind ; cut 
in Blices half an inch thick ; allow a pound of sugar to 



AND housekeeper's AID. 195 

every pound of apple. Put a layer in a glass jar, then a 
layer of sugar, and so continue until full ; set the jar in 
a kettle of cold water with straw at the bottom, and 
heat up until warmed through ; then cover the jar with 
bladder or waxed cloth, and keep in a dry, cool place. 

ORANGE PRESERVES. 

Take ripe oranges, and put in a kettle, with cold 
water enough to cover them ; put over the fire till the 
water is scalding hot ; then pour off the water, and re- 
peat the process until the water has no bitter taste ; 
then make a nice syrup in clear water, allowing a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit ; boil the syrup until thick ; 
put in the oranges and keep covered tight four or five 
days ; then take out the fruit and scald the syrup ; put 
in the oranges and give one boil ; then put in jars and 
cover tight. Very nice to eat with ice cream. 

COMPOTES OP FRUIT. 

Take any kind of fruit and boil in syrup made in the 
proportion of one half pound of sugar to one of fruit. 
This mode is for immediate use. Apples flavored with 
lemon or oranges, and when done peel and core ; then 
fill with marmalade. With the syrup poured over, is 
nice when preserves are scarce. 

BAKED APPLES FOR DESSERT. 

Take juicy apples ; pare and core them ; place in a 

pan and fill the holes with sugar and cinnamon ; put 

water in the pan to prevent their burning, and bake 

until tender ; w^hen cold, serve with cream or boiled 

custard. 

RICE JELLY. 

Boil half a pound of whole rice with a pound of loaf- 
sugar m one quart of water till it becomes a glutinous 
mass. Strain ofi" the jelly and cool in moulds. 

ORANGE JELLY. 

Boil one ounce and a quarter of isinglass in one pint 
of water, the rind of an orange, cut a stick of cinnamon, 
and three ounces of loaf-sugar, till the isinglass is dis- 
solved ; then squeeze two oranges or lemons, and enough 
9 



194 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

oranges to make a pint of juice ; mix all together and 
strain into a basin ; set it in a cool place for an hour, 
and when it begins to congeal fill your moulds ; when 
used, dip the mould into lukewarm water and turn on 
a dish ; garnish with slices of orange or lemon. 

BUM JELLY. 

Clarify and boil to a sjrwp a pound of loaf-sugar ; dis- 
solve one ounce of isinglass in half a pint of water ; 
strain it into the sji'up while half warm ; when nearly 
cold, stir in a quart of white wine ; mix it well and add 
two table-spoonfuls of Jamaica rum ; stir a few min- 
utes and pour into glasses. 

ORANGES FOR DESSERT. 

Peel and slice oranges ; arrange nicely in a glass dish, 
with powdered sugar sprinkled between each layer. 
If you like, add Madeira wine and more sugar when 
served. 

APPLES FOR DESSERT. 

Pare and scoop out the core ; have ready a syrup fla- 
vored with cinnamon or mace ; throw in and boil ten- 
der ; when cold, serve. 

BAKED QUINCES. 

Take nice ripe quinces ; bake quicker than apples ; 
then cut them open, remove the core, sprinkle white 
sugar over them, adding rich cream. Eat before cold. 

LEMON CUSTARD. 

Strain three wine-glassfuls of lemon-juice through a 
sieve ; beat nine eggs light ; strain and add to the 
lemon-juice, with a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar, 
a wine-glassful of white wine, half a glass of water, 
with a little grated lemon-peel ; mix well together, and 
pour into a small pail ; set it in a kettle of hot water, 
and stir until it becomes thick. 

APPLES AND RICE. 

Boil a coffee-cupful of rice in milk, with a stick of 
cinnamon ; pare ten or twelve apples ; scoop out the 
core, and fill up with raspberry jam. Border a deep 



AND housekeeper's AID. 195 

dish with paste ; put in the apples, leaving a space be- 
tween, and fill up with the rice. Brush the Avhole over 
with the yolk of egg, and sift sugar thickly over it ; 
form a pattern on top with sweetmeats ; then bake one 
hour in a quick oven. 

APPLE JELLY TO USE FOR OTHER FRUIT. 
Take four pounds of good apples ; after they are pared 
and cored, put them in a stewpan with a quart ot cold 
water ; stew till the fruit is broken ; then strain through 
a ielly-bag, and to every quart of juice allow a pound 
and a half of sugar. This is nice to preserve other 

fruit in. _ , ^^ 

ORANGE CUSTARD. 

Boil the rind of a Seville orange very tender ; then 
beat it to a paste ; add to it the juice of the orange, a 
table-SDOonful of good brandy, four ounces ot sugar, 
the yolks of four ecrgs. Beat all together for ten min- 
utes. Then pour in by degrees a pint of boiling cream, 
and beat until cold. Put into custard-dishes ; place 
them in a dish of hot water till set ; then put preserved 
orange or orange-chips on top. 

FRUIT ICE CREAM. 

Take a pine-apple and pare off the rind ; then cut the 
apple in slices ; put a layer of apple and white sugar 
alternately. Let it remain until a syrup is formed ; 
then drain off and flavor your cream. Pwaspberries and 
strawberries or any other fruit may be prepared in the 
same way. „ . t,^ 

BOILED CUSTARD. 

Scald a quart of milk and sweeten to the taste. Mix 
half a pint of cold milk with five well-beaten eggs, and 
stir in while the milk is boiling. It is nicer to strain 
the eo-frs before putting them in. Flavor as soon as 
stirreTin, and pour into a dish. If you wish to orna- 
ment it, beat the whites of three of the eggs with jelly, 
and put on top. 

TO MAKE MAPLE SUGAR. 

Strain the sap before putting over to boil ; put it in 
u'on kettles, and keep it constantly boiling. Have two 



196 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

large kettles ; take out of one and put into the other to 
keep it boiling ; fill up the one taken from with cold 
sap, and continue this until you sugar off, which should 
be done as often as you can conveniently, or every other 
day. This is done by straining the syrup through a 
bag like a jelly-bag ; then put back into the kettle, and 
boil until nearly thick enough for sugar. Clarify as for 
other sugar, and skim Avell. If you want it white, sti v 
well until just right to put into moulds, which should 
be wot with cold water to make the sugar come off 
easy. Shallow pans are preferable to kettles to use in 
boiling. 

CANnsriNG MAPLE MOLASSES. 

Fill your cans with the boiling syrup, and seal as in 
fruit, and it will retain the flavor and keep from sour- 
ing from spring to sj^ring. 

ABATER-MELON SYKUPr 

Take out the inside of ripe water-melons ; boil tJiem 
up in a little water ; then strain through a cloth and 
boil down to a syrnp. This is nice for apple butter 
and apple sauce. 

DRIED TOMATOES. 

Pour on boiling water, to take off the skins ; then 
cook them until half cooked away ; add a tea-cupful of 
sugar and a table-spoonful of salt to four quarts ; then 
sj^read on plates, and dry in a warm oven ; put in layers 
with paper between. When used, stew slowly in a good 
deal ot water ; then season with pepper and butter.' 

TO KEEP TOMATOES A YEAR. 

Prepare as above, and add mace, cloves, pepper, with 
salt and sugar. Put in jars and run mutton suet — or 
lard will answer — over them. 

TO DRY TOMATOES FOR PIES. 

Take the skins off in the usual way, then slice thin 
and sprinkle sugar over them, then dry in an oven ; 
soak a little while in cold water before using ; add a 
little lemon. 



AND housekeeper's AID. ] 97 

"WHITE POT. 

Whip four eggs liglit, add a pint of cream, nutmeg 
and sugar, then cut very thin a few slices of bread, and 
lay in a dish ; pour the eggs and cream over it, with a 
cupful of raisins and a small piece of butter, and, if re- 
quired, a little milk, so that it will not be too dry when 
baked ; bake slowly half or three quarters of an hour. 

TOMATO MAKMALADE. 

Strain the juice, and to every pint add three fourths 
of a pound of sugar, with the juice and rind of a lemon ; 
then cook until clear. 

TO PRESERVE GROUND CHERRIES. 

Take them from the husks when ripe, but not suffi- 
ciently ripe to leave the skins cracked ; wash them 
clean, and add three quarters of a pound of sugar to 
one of cherries ; put in a stewpan and stew gently un- 
til clear, then slice lemons or oranges, and put a layer 
in your jar as you put in your preserves. Rhubarb 
may be made in the same way. 

TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 

It is sometimes more convenient to measure articles 
than to weigli them. I give the exact equivalents, such 
as I have used myself. 

"WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 

-White sugar, one pound and a half is one quart ; 
brown sugar, if damp, one pound and ten ounces one 
quart ; loaf or broken sugar, one pound and six ounces 
one quart ; Indian meal, one pound two ounces one 
quart ; wheat flour, one pound one quart ; rye flour, 
one i^ound two ounces one quart ; eggs, ten eggs one 
pound ; butter, when soft, one pound is one pint ; one 
table-spoonful of salt is one ounce. 

MAKING WINE. 

Wine may be made from grapes by putting them 
(after sorting) in a barrel and pounding them with a 
pounder, but be careful not to break the seeds ; then 
put in a coarse cloth and submit it to the pressure. A 
cheese or portable cider-press is good for this purpose. 



198 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

"When the juice is all pressed out, which is from ten to 
fifteen quarts per bushel, put it in a clean keg or barrel, 
filling within a few inches of the bung, and let it remain 
for a week or two, when the wine becomes clear ; fill 
the cask full with more juice, reserved for that pur- 
pose ; tighten the bung, and place in a cool place un- 
til March, when it should be racked off into jugs or 
bottles, and cork securely. Omit the bottling until the 
wine is a year old, when the bottles should be sealed 
hermetically. If you wish, you can add a little sugar, 
say one ]30und to each gallon, but with perfectly ripe 
grapes it is not necessary. 

CUKKAWT WINE. 

Press out the juice, and to every two quarts add two 
of water and three pounds of sugar ; put in a brandy 
cask if one can be obtained, if not, a clean one will an- 
swer ; fill up to the top, when it will run over and work 
itself clear ; then cork tight, and let it stand six months ; 
it will then be fit for use, but all wines improve with 
age. You can bottle it up. 

BLAGKBERKY OR RASPBERRY WIWE. 

Measure and bruise the berries, and to every gallon 
add one quart of boiling water, let it stand twenty-four 
hours, stirring it occasionally, then strain in a cask, and 
to every gallon of juice add two pounds of sugar; cork 
it tight, let it stand until fit for use, then bottle. 

APPLE ■NTV'INE. 

Take nice ripe apples, press out the juice, and to 
every gallon add one pound of sugar ; let it stand from 
four to six montlis, when you will find it preferable to 
almost any other wine ; it can then be bottled. 

TOMATO "WIISrE. 

Press out the juice, and to every quart of juice add 
one pint of water and one pound of sugar ; set away to 
ferment, and skim until done fermenting ; tlien put in a 
tight cask and leave until spring, when it may be bot- 
tled ; add a small piece of ginger-root to each bottle. 
All wines are much improved by putting in brandy 
casks. 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 199 

VINEGAR. 

Every liousewife sliould supply her family with good 
vinegar, and the best way to do this is to have a barrel 
of cider in the fall placed in the cellar, and after it has 
worked, draw off and put in a keg ; then tack over the 
bung-hole a piece of gauze, and shake up as often as 
convenient, and in a few months you will have the best 
of vinegar. Keep all your cold tea, and rinsings of 
sweetmeat-jars, juice of fruit, etc., and pour into the 
barrel, and when it gets down in the keg fill up from 
the barrel. This is decidedly the best vinegar as well 
as the chea.pest. 

^WHISKY VINEGAR. 

Take five gallons of soft water, two quarts of whisky, 
two quarts of molasses, half a pint of good yeast ; roll 
a sheet of white paper in molasses and put in the mix- 
ture ; place in the sun, and in six weeks or two months 
it will be good vinegar. 

MAPLE VINEGAR. 

Take the sap that runs from the maple-tree in the 
spring and put it in a cask, roll a sheet of white paper 
in molasses and put in for the mother, and in a few 
weeks you will have good vinegar. The sap that runs 
after making sugar when the buds begin to come out 
will answer. If three barrels are boiled into one, it will 
be stronger. 

TO MAKE BEER. 

MOLASSES BEER. 

Six quarts of water, two quarts of molasses, half a 
pint of yeast, two spoonfuls of cream of tartar ; bottle 
after standing tAvelve hours. 

WHITE SPRUCE BEER. 

Five gallons of water, three pounds of white sugar, 
a cup of good yeast, with enough of the essence of 
spruce to give it a flavor ; when fermented, bottle it 
up. It is a delightful beverage in warm weather. 

ROOT BEER. 

Take five gallons of water, a few hops, some spruce, 
wintergreens, sassafras, hemlock, difierent kinds of 



200 EXCELSIOPw COOK BOOK 

roots, such as burdocks, dandelions, dock, sweet-apple 
bark, etc. ; boil and strain ; add a pint of molasses and 
a pint of yeast ; a little ginger will be an addition ; let 
it work, and it will make a healthy drink. 

HARVEST DRINK. 

One gallon of water, one pint of molasses or less will 
do, half a pint of vinegar, a table-spoonful of ginger. 

LEMONADE. 

Cut the lemon in slices, press out the juice, put on 
water, and sweeten with loaf-sugar to suit the taste. 

ELDERBERRY WINE. 

To every two quarts of elderberry-juice, add two of 
water, one quarter of a pound ginger-root, one quarter 
of a pound of allspice, two ounces of stick cinnamon, 
two ounces of nutmeg powdered, two ounces of cloves 
and mace each ; sixty pounds of sugar added to this 
quantity of spices will make forty gallons of wine. Mix 
well together and boil an hour ; then strain and set 
away to cool ; when milk- warm, put in your barrel ; 
then toast a slice of bread and dip in new yeast, and 
put in the barrel ; keep it uncorked until it has done 
fermenting, then cork it tight for three months ; then 
draw carefully off and wash the barrel clean ; turn back 
your wine, and add two jjounds of raisins and from ten 
to fifteen pounds of sugar, also three gallons of brandy. 
It will be fit for use in a week, but better when older. 

GINGER WINE. 

Take three gallons of water and add three pounds of 
sugar, four ounces of race ginger well washed ; boil to- 
gether one hour; strain through a 'sieve ; when luke- 
warm, put in a cask, adding three lemons cut in slices, 
and two gills of yeast. Shake it well and then cork it 
tight ; then let it stand a week or until it becomes 
clear ; then bottle, and it will be fit to drink in a fort- 
night. 

SPRUCE BEER. 

Boil a handful of hops and twice as much sassafras- 
root in ten gallons of water ; then strain it and pour in 



AND UOUSEKEEPEe's AID. 201 

while hot one gallon of molasses, two spoonfuls of the 
essence of spruce, two of powdered ginger, and one of 
pounded allspice ; then put in a cask, and when suffi- 
ciently cold add half a pint of yeast ; stir it well, cork 
it tight, and when fermented and clear, bottle it tight. 

GRAPE WINE. 

Bruise the grapes when ripe ; to each gallon of grapes 
put one gallon of Avater, and let it remain a week with- 
out stirring ; then drain off the liquor carefully, and to 
each gallon add three pounds of white sugar. Let it 
stand until fermented ; then cork tight. In six months 
it will be fit to bottle. 

CHEERY BOUNCE. 

Take two quarts of the wild black cherry ; pound 
them, in order to break the pits ; then add two pounds 
of sugar, one gallon of good rum or apple whisky ; put 
in a tight cask, and shake every day for three months ; 
then run the liquor twice through a thick cloth to clear 
it ; then put in bottles or cask. It is good for bowel 
complaints, and is a fine tonic. 

A RICH AND PLEASANT WINE. 

Take new cider, and mix as much honey as will sup- 
port an egg ; boil gently fifteen minutes in tin ; skim 
well, and when cool, put in a cask, but have not quite 
full. In six months it will be fit to bottle ; m six weeks 
it will be fit to drink. It will be less sweet if kept 
longer in the cask. This will serve for cooking pur- 
poses where sweet wine is directed. 

BLACK CURRANT WINE. 

Take three quarts of juice, the same of water, three 
pounds of sugar ; put in a cask, reserving a little for 
filling up. Let it remain in a Avarm room, and it will 
ferment ; then skim, and when the fermentation is over, 
fill up with the reserved liquor. When done working, 
add three quarts of brandy to forty quarts of wine. 
Bung up for nine months ; then bottle, and the settlings 
run through a jelly-bag until clear ; then bottle that. 
It will be good in a year, but, like all other wine, re- 
quires age.

twelve months ; then rack off the clear and filter through 
a thick flannel ; then add another quart of brandy. 
Cork it tight and keep three years ; then bottle. 

IMPERIAL. 

Take two ounces of cream of tartar and the juice and 
paring of two lemons ; put in a stone jar ; pour seven 
quarts of boiling water on ; stir and keep close. When 
cold, sweeten with loaf-sugar, and then strain and bottle 
it, adding half a pint of rum. This is a pleasant and 
wholesome drink. 

MEAD. 

Take three quarts of warm water, two pounds of 
drained honey, stirring it until the honey is dissolved ; 
then turn into a cask, leaving the bung out ; bottle as 
soon as fermented. Add a lemon to each gallon. 

BLACK CURRANT "WINE. NO. 2. 

Pick the currants when fully ripe ; squeeze out the 
juice, and to every gallon of juice add six quarts of 
water, and to each gallon of this mixture add three and 
a half pounds of brown sugar ; mix well together and 
strain. Put into a cask till fermentation takes place ; 
then cork well. 

CIDER WINE. NO. 2. 

Take a barrel of good cider ; let it remain two days 
after coming from the press ; draw off, and put in an- 
other barrel with sixty pounds of brown sugar and one 
pound of isinglass. After undergoing fermentation, 
bottle it for use. 

GRAPE -WINE. NO. 2. 

Gather the grapes when about half ripe ; pound them 
in a tub, and to every quart of fruit add two of water ; 
let it remain two weeks ; then draw off, and to every 



AND housekeeper's AID. 203 

gallon of liquor add three pounds of sugar. When the 
sugar is dissolved, cask it, and when done working, 
cork tight. In six months it will be fit to drink, when 
it should be bottled. 

PEACH CORDIAL. 

Take a peck of ripe, juicy peaches ; j^are and cut them 
from the stones ; crack about half the stones, and save 
the kernels ; leave the other half of the stones whole, and 
put with the peaches, also the meats. Put the whole 
into a wide-mouthed demijohn, and pour on two gal- 
lons of double-rectified whisky ; put in three pounds 
of lump-sugar ; cork tightly for three months ; then 
bottle it, and it will be fit for use. It will be clearer if 
strained. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL. 

Take nice ripe fruit and squeeze out the juice through 
a linen bag ; allow a poimd of loaf-sugar to every quart 
of juice. Put it into a preserving-kettle, and when the 
sugar is melted, set it on the stove and boil to a thin 
jelly. When cold, allow a quart of brandy to every 
quart of juice ; stir together and bottle immediately ; 
it is ready for use. Raspberry cordial is made the 
same as raspberry vinegar, except whisky is used in- 
stead of white vinegar. 

RHUBARB OR PIE-PLANT 'WINE. WO. 1. 

Mash and strain, and then add a pound of sugar to 
every two quarts of juice and one of water ; then pro- 
ceed as for currant wine. This makes a most excellent 
wine, and is a nice wine for the sick. 

ELDER A^INE. NO. 2. 

Take eight quarts of berries, four of water ; let it 
stand two days ; then boil one hour ; strain, and put 
three pounds of sugar to every gallon ; add cloves, cin-

LEMON CORDIALr 

Pare off the rind of eiglit lemons cut in shreds, and 
put in a large bottle ; add a pint of spirits of wine or 



204 EXCELSIOK COOK BOOK 

brandy, a dozen bitter almonds bruised and blanched ; 
let it remain a week. Make a syrup with a pound of 
lump-sugar ; when cool, pour into the bottle ; let stand 
a week longer ; then filter and bottle for use. 

RHUBARB -WINE. NO. 2. 

Cut the stalks of the rhubarb plant into small j^ieces ; 
boil until tender, which will be in a few minutes ; no 
water will be required, if washed before putting over ; 
strain through a bag and to each gallon of juice add 
two of water, and four pounds of sugar. Let it remain 
forty-eight hours in an open vessel ; then take off the 
scum, and add one pint of good brandy to every four 
gallons. Put it in a tight cask, and in six months it 
will be fit to bottle. Put a raisin in each bottle, and 
cork tight, after which seal up. This is equal to cham- 
pagne. 

RHUBARB VINEGAR. 

Take a dozen stalks of rhubarb, about middling size ; 
mash them fine in a tub, and then pour on five gallons 
of water ; let it stand twenty-four hours ; then strain 
and add nine pounds of sugar and a little brewers' 
yeast ; let it remain where it will be warm about a 
month, when it must be strained and put back in the 
cask again until it becomes vinegar, and it will equal 
French vine2:ar. 

CURRANT WINE. NO. 2. 

Press out the juice, and to every two quarts add one 
of water and three pounds of sugar ; let work as other

stood a month and been strained ; then filter through 
l^aper, and bottle for use. 

BASPBERRY. 

Pick over the fruit and put in a stone jar, and set the 
jar in a kettle of warm Avater till the juice will run ; 
strain, and to every pint add half a pound of sugar, 
give one boil, and skim ; when cold, add enough quan- 
tities of juice and brandy; shake well, and bottle. 

CURRANT SHRUB. 

To one pint of currant-juice i:>\it a pound of sugar ; 
boil gently eight minutes ; then let it cool. When 
almost cold, add a Avine-glassful of brandy to each pint 
of the juice ; bottle and cork it tight ; keep in a cool 
place. 

BERRRY VINEGAR. 

Take ripe strawberries, blackberries, or raspberries, 
and mix with vinegar in proportion of three quarts of 
berries to one of vinegar. Let it remain two or three 
days, then strain the Avhole, and to each pint put a 
pound of white sugar, and bottle without corking tight. 
This is a nice summer beverage to assuage thirst in 
fevers, colds, and inflammatory complaints ; also for 
those in good health. A large spoonful mixed with a 
tumbler of cold water. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. NO. 2. 

Pour three pints of the best white wine vinegar on a 
pint and a half of fresh gathered red rasj^berries in a 
stone jar ; the next day strain the liquor over the same 
quantity of fresh berries, and the following day the 
same ; then strain the whole, and add a pound of white 
sugar to a pint of juice. When the sugar is dissolved, 
set in a pot of water, and boil one hour, skimming as 
the scum rises on top. Add to each pint a glass of 
brandy, and bottle tight.

taric acid, and two quarts of Avater ; stir up and add 



206 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

the whites of two eggs well beaten ; set in a kettle of 
water till it scalds but not boil ; when cool, strain and 
add lemon sufficient to flavor it. Take two table-spoon- 
fuls of it to two thirds of a tumbler of water. If wanted 
for an effervescing drink, stir in a little carbonate of 
soda. 

GREEN GOOSEBERIIY "WIK"E. 

• To every pound of fruit add a quart of cold water ; 
let it stand three days ; then strain, and to every gallon 
of juice add three quarts sugar ; to every twenty quarts 
of liquor, one bottle of brandy. Hang some isinglass 
in a bag in the cask; when it has stood a year, plup it, 
and if the sweetness is sufficiently gone, bottle it. The 
gooseberries should be green but full grown. 

VINEGAR MADE FROM BEETS. 

Take one bushel of the sugar beet ; wash them clean ; 
then grate them and put in a cheese or portable cider- 
press ; put the juice in a barrel, cover the bung with a 
bit of grease to keep out the flies ; set it in the sun, and 
in two weeks it will be fit for use. One bushek will 
make five or six gallons of good vinegar. 

GINGER BEER. 

Pour a gallon of boiling water over three quarters 
of a pound of loaf-sugar, one ounce and a quarter of 
ginger, the rind of one lemon ; when lukewarm, add 
the juice of the lemon and half a cupful of lively yeast. 
Make it in the evening and bottle next morning. 

MEAD. 

Wash your honeycomb after draining the honey, and 
put it in a clean barrel or keg ; put in a little yeast, and 
when worked enough, draw off and bottle it. Lemons 
or oranges are a great improvement. 

MILK PUNCH. 

Beat up two eggs ; mix them with a quart of milk ; 
sugar, nutmeg, and lemon-peel to your taste. Boil it 
gently, stirring all the time, till thick enough ; take it 
from the fire and add a quarter of a pint of rum, stir- 
ring all the time the rum is poured in. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 207 

AN EXCELLENT VINEGAK. 

Take one gallon soft water ; add one pint of sugar 
or sorghum molasses ; stir till the sugar is dissolved ; 
then put in a gallon of ripe tomatoes. In a few days 
you Avill have nice pickles and good vinegar. 

SANGAREE. 

Take any kind of wine ; add cold water with nutmeg 
and sugar. Just before serving grate ice in the glasses 
imtil heaped up. Serve with cake. 

HO^W TO MAKE COFFEE AND TEA. 

Procure the Old Java coffee ; pick out the stones and 
bad grains ; then dry well, and brown it on the stove 
in a spider until about the color of walnut. It must be 
constantly stirred, or else it will brown uneven ; stir in 
a small piece of butter ; then turn out in a box kept for 
the purpose, and cover tight, as it loses its flavor if left 
uncovered. Never grind until just before using. 

In making, allow one table-spoonful to each person ; 
have your coffee-pot well rinsed and free from grounds, 
as old grounds spoil the taste. For six persons take 
the half of the white of an egg, (as more egg prevents 
the strength from extracting unless boiled a long time, 
which injures the taste ;) beat it Avell with the coffee, 
adding a little cold water ; put in the coffee-pot and 
turn boiling water on ; let it boil not longer than five 
minutes ; poUr out some and turn back to clear the 
spout, and then turn into an urn. Have rich cream, or 
scalded milk with the yolk of an egg beat stirred into it. 
Good sugar is also necessary to have good coffee. This 
is the best mode of making coffee I have ever tried. 

Another way is to leech it. This can be done by 
having a strainer in the top of the coffee-pot, and 
pour on boiling water, and wlien the water is drained 
through it is ready for use. Nothing will be required 
to settle it. The Old Dominion coffee-pot is made for 
this purpose. 

TEA. 

Green tea should not be boiled ; turn boiling water 
on, and after standing where it is warm five or ten miu- 



208 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

Tites, fill up. Black tea should boil ten or fifteen min- 
utes. Put a little water on at first and boil ; then fill 
up and let it boil again. Half black and half green is 
generally preferred. 

CHOCOLATE AND COCOA. 

Take one quart of water, three spoonfuls of scraped 
chocolate. Let it boil fifteen or twenty minutes ; then 
pour in one pint of rich milk, and sugar to your taste ; 
let it boil up ; then take it off and stand a few minutes, 
when it will settle ; pour out. 

Cocoa is made nearly the same, and is much used for 
delicate people who are out of health. Directions al- 
ways come with the cocoa, on the wrapper. 

MALT COFFEE. 

This comes already prepared, and is a great saving, 
for it is almost equal to the best Java coffee. It must 
be boiled half an hour or longer. 

S'WEET POTATO COFFEE. 

Wash them clean, and dry well ; then put them in 
the oven and brown them, as coffee ; grind and turn 
boiling water on, or boil without grinding ; but they 
will require more boiling to extract the strength. This 
is a good way of using the small sweet potatoes. Pars- 
nips scraped and browned make very good coffee. 

Coffee may be nicely settled by putting in (while 
boiling) a small piece of codfish skin in the place of 
egg. Let it boil five or ten minutes ; then turn in a 
little cold water and let it stand two or three minutes, 
when it will be as clear as if settled with an egg. 

Rye may be washed and dried, and nicely browned 
about the color of coffee ; then use half rye and half 
Java coffee, and very few persons can detect the rye. 
It is said that ochra, burnt like coffee, makes a bever- 
age very much like coffee. 

TO MAKE MACARONL 

Beat four eggs ; strain them and add flour enough 
to work into a paste ; work it well ; cut off a small bit 
at a time ; roll it out as thin as paper ; cut it with a 



AND housekeeper's AID. 209 

paste-cutter or knife into very narrow strips, tAvist and 
lay them upon a clean cloth in a dry, warm place. In 
a few hours they will be dry ; then put them in a box 
with white paper top and bottom. It may be used for 
soup. 

TO PRESERVE SWEET MARJORAM. 

Beat up the white of an egg ; add a little white 
sugar ; take some marjoram and rub on a glass that is 
quite clean, and lay it in the form of the glass ; so do it 
with the egg ; then sear it with the sugar on it, and 
lay on j^aper to dry. 

SOUR-KROUT. 

Cut your cabbage fine with a knife fixed in a frame, 
pack tight in a clean barrel, with salt between each layer 
of cabbage ; pound it down very tight, every layer, 
until full ; then put a weight on top, and put the cover 
on tight ; put in a warm cellar for three or four weeks ; 
then take off the scum which will rise on top, and lay 
a clean cloth on ; the juice should always stand on top. 
It will keep for years. Eat cold or fry in a little gravy. 

FLAVORED BUTTERMILK. 

Put six quarts of fresh buttermilk in a strainer ; hang 
in a cool place two or three days, or until it drains 
well ; then put in a dish, and add a glass of brandy or 
wine ; sweeten with loaf-sugar ; then color with rasp- 
berry jam ; whisk it well together, and serve in a glass. 

BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

THE KEEPING OF COWS. 

There is a great difference in the quality of milk ; 
some cows gave much richer milk than otliers. Much 
depends upon the treatment of cows in the quality of 
butter and cheese. In the first place, farmers should 
endeavor to procure the best breed, not the largest and 
best looking, but those that produce the best quality 
of milk. It is not those that give the most milk that 
are the most profitable to keeprbut the richness of the 
milk should be looked to. Cows must be kept well 
through the winter, and allowed to come in about the 



210 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

middle or first of April, to be good dairy cows. A few 
weeks before calving they should be messed as often as 
once a day, if not twice. The calves should be taken 
away within a week ; the sooner the better, as they 
more easily learn to feed if taken away at once. Warm 
the milk and feed twice a day, or, if convenient, they 
may be fed at noon also. After the first week a little 
skim-milk or buttermilk may be given, the latter being 
the best if they will drink it. I have seen splendid 
calves brought up upon nothing but buttermilk, and 
turned into pasture. Some let them run with the cows 
— two calves with one cow. If the cow is healthy, the 
milk will be good after the seventh or eighth milking.. 
They should always be milked in warm weather before 
the sun rises, so they can pasture before the heat be- 
comes oppressive, and should be milked early at even- 
ing. Regularity should be observed, as it makes a dif- 
ference in the quantity of milk. Always milk at the 
same hour of the day. It is well to have one cow come 
in the first of January, for family use, and where there 
are a number of cows, it is quite as profitable. They 
should be salted twice a week or oftener. Carrots are 
good for cows ; turnips spoil the taste of the milk. 
They should never be allowed to run, as it injures the 
milk. When the milk is strained, it should be put in 
six-quart pans, only filling them half-full, as the milk 
will only rise so far ; if more is put in, you will get but 
little more cream. Keep in a cool, dry cellar, not too 
much light, and so that the wind can not blow in, or 
the cream will be hard, and when churned, much of it 
will remain in small pieces, and you will not get as 
much butter. Every thing should be kept perfectly 
clean and sweet. Fresh meat or vegetables should 
never be put in a milk-cellar. An ice-house is almost 
indispensable to making butter, but if you have a cool 
cellar and cool water, very good butter may be made 
during the hottest weather. 

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING BUTTER. 

Some people churn sweet milk, others let the milk 
sour, and tlien churn, adding a great deal of water. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 211 

But I think rich cream, makes the best flavored butter, 
and certainly of the best color, and will keep longer 
than butter churned from milk. The milk should be 
skimmed in warm weather as soon as it is sour. Morning 
and evening is the best time for skimming. Put the 
cream in an earthen jar, and if you do not churn every 
day, keep a stick in it to stir occasionally. The oftener 
you churn, the better quality your butter will be. If you 
have ice, put some into a tub, well covered with flannel, 
to prevent its melting ; this will keep your cellar cool 
during the warmest weather ; when you churn, put a 
lump of ice in the churn. 

In cold weather the milk should be set over the fire 
and warmed, when it comes from the cow ; in twenty- 
four hours take off the cream ; it will not be as thick 
for scalding, but will be richer, and will make more 
butter, and of a better color and quality. The butter 
will come in fifteen minutes if the cream is scalded. In 
warm weather, or when the milk has not been scalded, 
an hour is the usual time for churning. If the milk is 
the right temperature, the butter will be hard and yel- 
low. The butter should be rinsed off the cover and 
dasher about five minutes before it gathers together ; 
then churn slowly imtil it becomes solid. Take up with 
a wooden ladle, and wash all the buttermilk out, (or if 
you can work out the buttermilk without w^ashing, the 
butter w^ill be sweeter ;) then salt, allowing one ounce 
of salt to a pound of butter ; but as some people like 
their batter Salter than others, this should be done 
from experience. Use no salt but rock-salt ground. 
It comes in sacks expressly for dairies. Work the salt 
in well, and let it remain a few hours, when it should 
again be worked, and packed ; if worked too much, it 
will injure the taste of the butter. If put in firkins or 
pails, tliey should be soaked over night in cold water, 
(after being thoroughly cleaned ;) wash well ; then take 
a cloth wet with strong brine and wash again ; put in 
your butter and pack solid. AVet a linen cloth in a so- 
lution of saltpetre, and lay on top ; cover tight until 
another churning is put in ; then repeat the process. 
The sooner the firkin is filled the better. If kept in fir- 



212 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

kins any length of time, put a layer of salt on the cloth ; 
then fit the cover in tight to exclude the air ; or a brine 
may be made in the folio Aving manner : one quart of 
fine salt, half a pail of water, an ounce of saltpetre, and 
two ounces of white sugar ; boil it and skim well ; Avhen 
cold, pour on ; this will keep it sweet a long time. 

Always churn in the morning while the atmosphere 
is coolest ; in winter, warm the cream. A little salt 
stirred into the cream while getting a churning, will 
keep it sweet, and some think the butter comes sooner. 

TO PBEPARE A RENNET. 

Take the rennet from a healthy calf not over four 
weeks old ; it should be kept without food for twelve 
hours, for the secretions of the stomach to accumulate 
strength. Empty the curd out, but not rinse, then rub 
with salt, and stretch on a hoop to dry. It is better to 
be a year old before using. When used, soak in a jar 
a gallon of water to a rennet ; rub salt on, and stir often ; 
keep more salt on than will dissolve. In three or four 
days the liquid is fit for use, and can be bottled and 
kept in a cool place. If there is any taint, do not use 
it, as it wiU. spoil the cheese. Allow one gill to thirty- 
five gallons of milk. Stir always before using. 

MAKING CHEESE. 

Have every thing connected with the making of 
cheese well cleaned and scalded. You will require two 
strainers, one hoop, a basket, ladder, tub, and press. 
Strain your night's milk in your tub ; in the morning 
when the cows are milked, warm it in a brass kettle or 
tin boiler, and turn in with the night's milk ; after stir- 
ring it well, put in rennet sufficient to form the curd 
well in half an hour. The milk should be heated to 
ninety-eight degrees or one hundred of Fahrenheit. 
When the curd is nicely formed, take a long-bladed 
knife and cut it through in squares, or you may break 
it gently with the hands. Great care must be used, or 
the whey will run off" milky, and the cheese will be in- 
jured. The whey should look green when it runs off*. 
Put your ladder on another tub to catch the whey ; lay 



AND housekeeper's AID. 213 

on your basket, put the strainer on, and then dip out 
the curd carefully into the basket, occasionally lifting 
the ends to hasten the draining. When all is in, turn 
up the corners, and set a wei.ght on to press out the 
^"hey. Every few minutes the curds should be cut up 
and pressed again, but must not be hurried too much. 
When thoroughly drained, if to be pressed the same 
day, it must be prepared for scalding ; but if not to be 
pressed until another curd is made, it must be put into 
the cellar or some cool place, and hung up to drain. 

TO SCALD THE CURD. 

Cut the curd into little squares the fourth of an inch 
in size ; put them into a strainer, and immerse it in a 
vessel of Avarm water, enough to cover it. Then heat 
it to the temperature of one hundred and five degrees. 
Stir it all the time until warmed through ; then gradu- 
ally add cold water until reduced to ninety degrees. 
Put it in your basket and drain it ; then salt, allowing a 
quarter of a pound of salt for every ten pounds of curd, 
and mix carefully. Place it in a hoop, strainer and all ; 
make it smooth, and put a cover on top, and put in the 
press. It must not be pressed very hard at first, but 
more weights put on afterwards. In two hours or three 
it will be ready to turn ; then take another cheese-cloth 
wet it in a little salt and Avater, and turn into that, and 
put back into the press. In nine or ten hours turn 
again, and if the edges require paring, do it with a 
sharp knife. Let it remain two days in the press if you 
can. It is well to have two presses for this purpose, 
where a cheese is made every day. When taken from 
the press, rub it over with butter and keep in a dry, cool 
place. If they spread too much, sew a bit of cotton 
cloth around them when taken from the press. It is a 
good plan to put cayenne pepper in the butter you rub 
on, to prevent the flies from troubling them. They must 
be greased aad turned every day, until fully cured. If 
you wish to color the cheese, boil annotto with a little 
lye, and put to the milk Avhen you add the rennet. If 
too much rennet is put in, the cheese will be strong, 
and if too much salt, they will be hard. If the milk is 
too hot, they will be tough. 



214 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

Sage cheese is made by pounding the sage, and then 
squeezing out the juice and straining in with the rennet. 
Spinach or corn leaves are also nice to add with sage. 

COTTAGE OK DUTCH CHEESE. 

Take half buttermilk and half sour milk after it has 
been skimmed, and heat over the fire until the curd 
settles at the bottom ; then put in a cloth, sewed up at 
the corner like a jelly-bag, and let it drain. When 
drained, add salt, cream, or butter, and make in balls. 
This is best made fresh. It is nice eaten with cream 
and pej^per. 

BRANDT CHEESE. 

Grate cheese, or the dry bits may be used for this pur- 
pose, and pack in brandy. Put a layer of cheese in a 
jar, pour on some brandy and pound down tight ; cover 
well, and when eaten cut off in slices ; this will keep a 
long time. 

AITOTHER METHOD OF MAKING CHEESE. 

After pressing out all the whey and scalding as for 
the press, pack in jars and press down closely ; then 
put a linen cloth on top, of several folds thickness, and 
when saturated, remove it and place a dry one in its 
place. The next day add the other curd, and continue 
so until full. Another way is to hang it up after salt- 
ing, in a strainer, and let it remain until it ripens. I 
have never tried either of these modes, and can not 
vouch for their goodness. 

TO PRESERVE CHEESE FROM THE FLY. 

It is the small cheese-fly that is so troublesome to 
cheesemakers. They lay the egg^ and it soon begins 
to work its way into the cheese. I have sometimes put 
annotto into the butter before rubbing the cheese ; also 
red peppers steeped strong and put in is a preven tive ; 
but the most successful way of keeping the insect from 
troubling the cheese is to rub it over with a flour paste, 
and then wrap a cloth round it, and one on the top and 
bottom. Cover over with paste, and keep in a dark, 
cool place. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 216 

TO KAISE CREAM. 

When the milk conies in, have your pans in boiling 
water ; strain into one and turn the other over ; this 
will hasten the rising of the cream, and it will be of a 
better quality. 

CHEESE CREAM. 

"Warm a pint of milk and a pint of cream, and put a 
little rennet to it ; keep in a warm place till curdled ; 
have a proper mould with holes, either of china or any 
other. Put the curds in to drain about an hour or less , 
serve with a good plain cream and sugar over it. 

WELSH RABBIT. NO. 1. 

Cut a slice of bread and toast it ; then soak it in red 
wine ; cut slices of cheese, and rub a little butter on 
the bottom of a dish ; lay the cheese upon it, and pour 
in two or three spoonfuls of white wine and a little 
mustard ; then put the toast on top, and set in the oven 
till warmed through. 

•WELSH RABBIT. WO. 2. 

Lay slices of bread and butter in a dish, and a layer 
of cheese alternately, till full ; then make a custard 
without sugar, and bake fifteen minutes. 

CONFECTIONEIIY. 

TO CANDY FRUIT. 

It must be preserved and dried in a stove, that none 
of the syrup may remain. Sugar for candying must be 
prepared in the following manner. Take a pound of 
sugar, with half a pint of water, and set it over a fire. 
Take off the scum as it rises, and boil until it looks 
clear ; take some out, and when it is cold, if it will 
draw a thread from the spoon, it is boiled enough for 
any kind of sweetmeat ; then boil your syrup, and if it 
begins to candy around the edges of your pan, it is 
boiled enough, or is candy height. Sweetmeats must 
not be put into too rich syrup or the fruit will wither, 
and both the beauty and flavor will be destroyed. 



216 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

TO CANDY ALL KINDS OF FRUIT. 

"VYhen completed in the syrup put a layer into a new 
sauce, and dip it suddenly into hot water to take off 
the syrup that hangs about it ; then j^ut it on a napkin 
before the fire to drain, and then do more on the sieve. 
Take some refined sugar and sift over the fruit till 
quite white ; set it on the shallow end of the sieve in 
a warm oven, and turn it two or three times. It must 
not be cold till dry. Watch it carefully, and it will be 
beautiful. 

CARAMEL, TO ORNAMENT PASTRY. 

Take syrup after it has candied high, and with a 
spoon drop into any kind of mould in fine threads till 
it is covered. The mould should be greased first, so 
that it will readily come ofiT. Make a small handle of 
caramel or two or three small gum-paste rings, and 
place it over pastry of any description. 

TO CANDY CITRON. 

Pare them very thin and narrow, and throw them 
into water. Take out the inner part with great care, 
so as to leave only the white part. When tender, take 
them out and have a clarified syrup boiled to almost a 
candy height ; then put in the rings and boil ; take 
from the fire, and when the sugar becomes white by 
rubbing it with a spoon against the side of the pan, it 
is time to take out the rings and lay them on a sieve 
to drain ; then cut into proper lengths and dry. 

CREAM SNOW. 

Take a quart of cream, the whites of three eggs, four 
spoonfuls of sweet wine ; sugar to the taste ; add a bit 
of lemon-peel ; whip to a froth. Serve in a dish after 
taking out the peel. 

SUGAR KISSES. NO. 2. 

Stir the whites of four eggs to a stiflT froth ; add half 
a pound of white sugar, and flavor as you like. Lay 
in heaps on white paper, each the size and shape of 
half an egg^ and an inch apart ; place them on a board 
and bake in a moderate oven. When they turn a little 



AND housekeeper's AID. 217 

yellow, slip them off the paper and let them cool five 
minutes ; then take two of the kisses and join the two 
bottoms together ; press gently and they will adhere ; 
they look very handsome. Put currant jelly or any 
other kind you like between them. 

LEMON DKOPS. 

Stir loaf-sugar into lemon-juice as thick as you can 
stir it ; put into a basin or porcelain kettle, and stir 
with a wooden stick over a moderate fire five minutes ; 
flavor with the extract of lemon, and then drop with 
the point of a knife on to white paper. When cold, 
take off. 

SUGAR CANDY. 

Allow half a pint of water to one pound of sugar, 
half a sheet of isinglass, a tea-spoonful of gum-arabic ; 
dissolve the whole in a brass kettle or preserving-kettle ; 
when it boils, remove from the fire and skim well ; then 
put it on again and boil till it becomes brittle, which is 
ascertained by dropping a little in cold water. If made 
of white sugar, add a little vinegar, or it will be too 
brittle. Flavor with any essence you prefer ; color it 
if you like. If nuts or cocoa-nut meats are added, put 
in before pouring out. Make in any shape you like. 

CBEAM OF ANY PRESERVED TRUIT. 

Take half a pound of any preserved fruit ; put in a 
pan, with the whites of two or three eggs ; beat to- 
gether half an hour ; take off with a spoon, and lay on 
a glass dish, with other creams, or put in the middle 
of a basin. Raspberries will not do. 

ESSENCE OP CINNAMON. 

Infuse the oil in highly rectified spirits of wine in 
proportion of half a drachm of oil to an ounce of wine. 
Cloves, the oil, is made the same ; the quantities are 
one ounce of cloves to three quarts of brandy, and four 
pounds of sugar dissolved in four pints of water. 

LEMONS TO KEEP FOR PUDDINGS. 
Put the rinds in cold water and let them remain two 
weeks ; then boil in the same till tender ; strain it, and 
10 



218 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

when nearly dry, throw them into a jar of candy that 
you have remaining from old sweetmeats, or if you 
have none, make a syrup of loaf-sugar and water, and 
pour over them. In a week boil them till they look 
clear. They must be covered. 

PREPARATION OF FOOD FOR THE 

SICK. 

-WATEK GBUEL. 

Stir three large spoonfuls of Indian meal, or oatmeal 
if preferred, smooth with a little water ; pour into a 
a quart of boiling water, and let it boil fifteen or twenty 
minutes ; season with a little salt, and if desired, a little 
sugar and nutmeg will render it more palatable ; also 
a little milk or cream is nice if the patient can take it. 

MILK PORKIDGE. 

This is made in the same way, only use flour instead 
of Indian meal, and milk in the place of water. 

EICE GEUEL. 

Boil a little rice in water until tender ; then strain 
off the liquor and sweeten to the taste ; add a little 
salt and nutmeg. 

BAKLET WATEK. 

"Wash the barley and pour on cold water ; let it sini- 
mer ; then add a few raisins, and boil until tender ; 
season with salt and nutmeg. Rice may be made in 
the same way. 

PANADA. 

Pour water on light bread or crackers, and season 
with sugar and nutmeg ; add an egg, if allowed ; a few 
raisins added with the crackers are nice. Hot water 
must be poured on and covered up tight imtil they 
soak. 

"WINE OR CIDER PANADA. 

Pour boiling water on crackers, or bread toasted or 
not just as preferred ; then add a wine-glassful of cider 
or wine ; flavor with nutmeg. Invalids almost always 
relish this when they can take nothing else. A little 
butter should be added. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 219 

CAUDLE. 

Take water gruel, rice, or barley ; add a wine-glass- 
ful of wine or ale, and season with nutmeg or sugar. 

BREAD JELLY. 

Toast slices of stale bread ; pour boiling water on 
and a little lemon-juice, and then boil to a jelly; strain 
and sweeten it ; add a little nutmeg or lemon-peel to 
flavor. This is nice for young children. 

CHICKEN JELLY. 

Cut a chicken, or an old fowl will answer just as 
well ; pound the bones and then put in a jar and cover 
it tight. Set the jar in a kettle of boiling water, and 
keep it boiling three hours ; then strain off the liquor 
and add salt, pepper, loaf-sugar, and lemon. The fowl 
may be boiled again and will make as much jelly as 
before. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 

Soak four table-spoonfuls of tapioca, in water to 
cover it, five hours ; stir it into a pint of boiling water, 
and let it simmer gently ; when thick and clear, mix 
two table-spoonfuls of lemon-juice, half a wine-glass of 
wune, and stir into the jelly ; then turn into cups. Sago 
jelly may be made in the same way. 

SASSAERAS JELLY. 

Take the pit of the sassafras boughs, and soak in cold 
water until it becomes glutinous. It is much relished 
by the sick, and is also nourishing. 

CALVES' FEET BROTH. 

Put water enough on to cover them, and boil down 
to half ; strain the liquor, and take off the fat, season 
with salt and a little wine. This is very nourishing 
and strengthening for an invalid. 

CALVES' FEET BLANC MANGE. 

Split the feet and wash clean ; pour on four quarts 
of cold water, and boil down to one ; strain it and set 
away to cool ; then remove the fat and take off the set- 
tlings at the bottom, and add a quart of new milk ; 



220 EXCELSIOE COOK BOOK 

sweeten to the taste, and boil a few minutes with lemon- 
peel or a stick of cinnamon ; then strain it through a 
sieve into a pitcher, and stir until cold ; when milk- 
warm, wet the moulds with cold water, and pour in. 
This is nice for sick or well. 

BEEF TEA, 

Take a pound of fresh beef, cut it thin, and put it in 
a wide-mouthed bottle, with a little salt ; place it in a 
kettle of cold water, and boil an hour ; then strain it, 
and there will be a gill of liquid. Begin with a little 
at first, and give as the stomach will bear. I have 
sometimes added a little water when put over to boil. 
This has been retained on the stomach when nothing 
else would. 

ANOTHER BEEF TEA. 

Slice dried beef very thin, pour on boiling water, and 
cover it tight ; set it in a warm place, for half an hour 
or so, then add a little piece of butter and pepper ; 
crumb in a little bread, or crackers, if wished. 

"WHINE "WHEY. 

Boil half a pint of milk, and the moment it boils, 
pour in a glass of wine, with a little lump-sugar ;" the 
curd will soon form, then take it off and set it aside 
until it settles ; pour the whey off and add a little hot 
water ; sweeten to the taste. 

AKROW-ROOT. 

Stir a table-spoonful smooth with a little cold water, 

then pour on boiling water until it thickens and looks 

clear ; season with sugar, salt, lemon or nutmeg, or eat 

with cream and sugar. This is nice for children when 

teething. 

SAGO. 

Take a tea-cupful of sago and let it soak three hours, 
then boil it with some lemon-peel until it is transparent ; 
add a little milk, lump-sugar, and nutmeg. 

CUSTARD EGG. 

Beat an egg to a froth, and add a pint of new milk 
just from the cow ; add a little sugar and nutmeg, or if 



AND housekeeper's AID. 221 

wine is allowed, add a Avine-glass of wine instead of the 
milk, and take half an hour before breakfast. This is 
very nourishing and strengthening for an invalid. 

HOT LEMONADE. 

Cut up a lemon and pour on boiling water ; add a 
tea-cupful of lump-sugar. This is an excellent drink 
for colds. 

BEEF, VEAL, OR CHICKEN BKOTH. 

Boil the meat with a little rice, until tender ; season 
with a little salt, and put in an earthen vessel, and 
when wanted, warm a little at a time, and crumb in 
crackers. 

CODFISH BKOTH. 

Cut salt codfish in small pieces, and put on cold 
water ; let it boil a minute or two, then pour on more 
water, and add a little butter, or, if preferred, add 
cream instead of water ; toast crackers or bread and 
pour on to it. 

EGG FOB INVALIDS. 

Break an egg in a saucer ; add a small piece of but* 
ter, with a little salt ; then set it on the stove, and stir 
until cooked sufiiciently. Another way is to break the 
egg into boiling water, having previously salted the 
water ; take it up as soon as the white is hard ; dip a 
slice of toast in hot water and lay the egg on top, after 
buttering the toast. 

FLOUR GRUEL. 

Tie a pint of flour in a cotton cloth, and boil in water 
three hours ; then take out of the cloth, and grate it 
when used, and pour on boiling water; add a little 
milk, and flavor with sugar and salt. This is good for 
invalids or teething children. 

CREAM OF TARTAR "WHET. 

Heat a pint of milk scalding hot, stir fn a tea-spoon- 
ful of cream of tartar ; strain it, and sweeten with 
lump-sugar. 



222 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

SIMPLE DRINKS FOR THE SICK. 

Pour boiling water on to dried tart apples, tama- 
rinds, cranberries, currants, whortleberries, and then 
pour off the water and sweeten it to the taste ; add a 
little wine, if allowed. These drinks are nice and cool- 
ing in fevers. 

FLOUR COFFEE. 

Take wheat flour and scorch very evenly in a spider, 
stirring all the time, then put some in a bowl and pour 
on hot water, and let it stand a few minutes, keej)ing it 
warm, and then pour off the coffee and sweeten, adding 
a little cream. Cocoa is very palatable and nutritious 
for the sick, and the directions are always given on the 
papers. Java coffee is sometimes used for those who 
can bear it, made with milk instead of water, and 
sweetened to the taste. 

TOMATO SYKUP. 

Take the juice of ripe tomatoes, and put a pound of 
sugar to each quart of juice ; put it in bottles, and set 
it aside ; in a few weeks it will have the flavor of pure 
wine, and, mixed with water, is a nice beverage for the 
sick. 

BUTTERMILK "WHEY. 

Boil fresh buttermilk, and as soon as boiled pour into 
a bowl ; add a little salt, lump-sugar to the taste, and 
a little nutmeg if liked ; sometimes a cracker rolled 
fine is acceptable. 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

When the buttermilk is boiling, stir in an egg well 
beaten, and take up ; add a little cream or butter, 
sugar, and spice. 

ALUM WHEY. 
Mix a little pounded alum with milk, strain it 
through a cloth ; add nutmeg and sugar to the whey. 
It is good for colic and hemorrhages. 

TO MAKE ALUM WHEY FOR POULTICES. 

Take a pint of milk and Avarm it, stir in a lump of 
alum till it Avheys, then take out the curd, and use for 
poultices. 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 223 

EGG TEA. 

Beat the yolk of an egg with a spoonful of sugar > 
pour boilmg water on, and then stir in the white, beat 
en to a froth ; add spice to suit the taste. When a 
person has taken a violent cold, get them Avarm in bed 
and give th's as hot as it can be taken, and it will often 
effect a cure. 

EGG COFFEE. 

Beat the yolk of an egg with a large spoonful of 
sugar, then put in a cup of cold coffee ; add a tea-cup 
of cold water and as much cream, then add the white 
of the egg, beaten to a stiff froth. This is much rel- 
ished by invalids. 

COUGH TEA. 

Make a strong tea of everlasting, strain it, and to 
every quart add two ounces of liquorice-root, two of 
raisins, and boil half an hour ; when taken up, add the 
juice of a lemon. This is an excellent remedy for a 
tight cough. If taken hot, care should be taken not to 
expose yourself after drinking it for a few hours. 

THOKOUGHWORT BITTEES. 

Take the blossoms off, as they are apt to cause vomit" 
ing, then make a strong tea of the stalks, then strain 
it, and when cool, add half a pint of French brandy, 
the peel of two oranges cut into bits, and fennel seed ; 
put all into a bottle and cork it tight. Take a wine- 
glass of the bitters and put into half a tumbler of water ; 
sweeten it if you like. It is an excellent remedy for 
fever and ague and bilious colic. 

FLAX-SEED JELLT. 

Pour boiling water on to a quarter of a pound of 
flax-seed, cover up tight, and let it remain two or three 
hours ; then strain, and add the juice of a lemon and 
white sugar to the taste ; or it may be boiled in mo- 
lasses candy and taken in that way. It is good for a 
cough or costiveness. 

MOSS JELLY. 

Steep Irish moss in cold water a few minutes, then 
drain off the water, and to half an ounce of moss put a 



224 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

quart of fresh water and a stick of cinnamon ; boil it 
to a thick jelly, strain it, and add sugar and a glass of 
wine if it can be taken. It will not keep long if no 
wine is put in. 

FOB HOARSENESS OB LOADED CHEST. 

Take eight or ten drops of the balsam of copaiba and 
drop on a piece of loaf-sugar ; take three times a day, 
morning, noon, and night. Try a few days, and if it 
does good, it will effect a cure in a week. Horse-radish, 
made into a tea and sweetened with honey or loaf- 
sugar is good ; add a little vinegar. Take a tea-spoon- 
ful occasionally. 

A TONIC FOB INDIGESTION. 

Take twenty grains of rhubarb, gentian, carbonate 
of iron, and Spanish liquorice, pour a pint of boiling 
water on, and take from two to three table-spoonfuls 
three times a day. A little sugar can be added to make 
it more palatable if you like. Take the mixture cold. 

CUBE FOB A DBY COUGH. 

Take half an ounce of gum-arabic, the same of liquor- 
ice, dissolve in warm water, squeeze the juice of a 
lemon ; then add two drachms of paregoric, one of 
squills. Put in a bottle and shake Avell. Take a tea- 
spoonful when the cough is troublesome. 

CUBE FOB EABACHE. 

A little sweet oil and laudanum dropped warm into 
the ear, and applying hot salt in a bag to keep it warm. 
The heart of an onion roasted is good. 

STING OP A BEE. 

Apply an onion cut in two, and let it remain until the 
pain subsides, and it is a certain remedy. Another is 
to apply saleratus. Wet salt is also good. Whatever 
is applied should be done before the part begins to 
swell. 

TO MAKE OPODELDOC. 

Dissolve an ounce of camphor in a pint of rectified 
spirits of wine, then dissolve four ounces of white 



AND HOUSEKEEPER S AID. 225 

Spanish soap, scraped tliin, in four ounces of rosemary, 
and mix together. Add half an ounce of origanum if 
you like. 

TO CURE CRAMP. 

A cold application to the bottom of the feet, such 
as iron, ice, water, or any thing cold that can be had, 
the colder the better. If the cramp is in the arms or 
upper part of the body, apply it under the arms, and 
it will relieve in five minutes. 

TO DRY HERBS. 

Gather them on a dry day, while in blossom, and be- 
fore dog-days, as they are much stronger. When dry, 
hang uj) in paper bags. 

A REMEDY FOR SCARLET FEVER. 

Give two table-spoonfuls of yeast to an adult, and to 
a child two or three years old one spoonful, to be taken 
every two hours. For sore throat gargling yeast will 
give immediate relief. 

IMPORTANT REMEDY FOR CANCERS. 

Take an egg and break the small end to let out the 
white, then put in salt and mix with the yolk until a 
a salve is formed. Put a portion of this on a piece of 
leather or brown paper, and apply twice a day. This 
has been known to effect a perfect cure. 

CURE FOR BRONCHITIS. 

One drop of croton oil rubbed on the throat daily 
will produce an eruption of the skin, and will, if per- 
severed in, effect a cure. Smoking is also good. 

FOR A CUT. 

Tie up with brown sugar and pour on spirits, then 
let it remain several days, wetting occasionally in spir- 
its. When dressed apply the leaf of the fish geranium, 
and it will soon heal, or the leaf may be immediately 
applied as soon as cut. When a nail or piece of glass 
ha^been run into the foot, bind on salt pork, and if 
much swelled, bathe with a decoction of wcrmwood, 
then bind on more pork, and keep as quiet as possible. 

10* 



220 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

Salt pork is also good for a bad cut. A poultice made 
of hot lye is also good, and should be kept on several 
hours, dipping it in lye whenever it gets cold. Slight 
"vvounds often occasion lock-jaw, and should not be ne- 
glected. Spirits of turpentine is also good. Puff-balls 
or spiders' webs are good to prevent bleeding. Peach 
leaves, or even the twigs well steeped, are said to be 
good to apply where a nail or glass has gone into the 
foot. 

AN EFFECTUAL CURE FOR A FELOlSr. 

Soak the part affected in weak lye, putting it in cold, 
and sitting near the fire till it scalds ; then take the yolk 
of an egg^ six drops of turpentine, a few beet-leaves, 
a small quantity of soap, one tea-spoonful of burnt salt, 
and one of Indian meal. It never fails to effect a cure 
if applied in season. Another effectual cure, but more 
simple, is to apply the prickly pear, bind it on after 
bruising it, and change till a cure is effected. 

TO CURE RIWG'WORM. 

Get the grease from a church-bell, which forms a kind 
of verdigris, mix with unsalted lard, and apply a plaster 
twice a day. It is a certain cure. Gunpowder, applied 
wet on going to bed at night, and let it remain till 
morning, is good. 

BURNS. 

Many receipts are given for burns, but the best one 
is, to wet cotton batting with linseed oil or sweet oil ; 
if neither are at hand, use any other, or castor oil is 
very good. The cotton should not be removed till the 
skin is healed or the new skin will adhere to it. More 
oil should be applied, but not opened to the air. If a 
very bad burn, a physician should be called to dress it, 
the second time. For a slight burn, spirits of turpen- 
tine is good. 

CROUP. 

This is a dangerous disease ; medical aid should be 
procured as soon as possible. It is well to kec]^ the 
ipecac root in the house, as that will not lose its 
strength like the powdered. This disease is known by 



AND housekeeper's AID. 227 

a peculiar whistling sound in the breathing, and if ne- 
glected proves fotal. Steep some ipecac in warm water 
— it must not boil — then sweeten it, and give enough 
to sicken, or if they vomit it will be better. Soak the 
feet, put on draughts of mustard, and get the child into 
a perspiration, and bathe the throat with volatile lini- 
ment. This if well done will give relief. Cold water 
applied to the throat and chest, and then well covered 
with flannel to sweat it, is good, but should be care- 
fully used. Wet the cloths in cold water as soon as 
they get warm. 

SOKE THROAT. 

A gargle of salt and water, or vinegar, is good for a 
common sore throat. Brandy or rum and lump-sugar 
is also good. One large spoonful of Cayenne pepper, 
a tea-spoonful of salt, and a pint of boiling water, or 
half vinegar, is still better; pour on the water first, then 
add the vinegar. This is an excellent remedy for putrid 
sore throat. Let it settle and then gargle in the throat 
every half-hour. Bind on the throat a piece of salt 
pork cut thin, and if it is very bad, keep it on two or 
three days. The skin will then break out in small 
blisters, which will be a benefit. A mustard poultice is 
good and will give instant relief almost. Either of 
these are good for ulcerated sore throat. White oak 
bark made into a tea, with a small piece of alum in and 
used as a gargle, is good. 

CANKERED MOUTH. 

Touch the cankered spots with saltpetre, or burnt 
alum powdered is good. Red raspberry or blackberry 
leaves made into a tea are good for calomel sore mouth ; 
sweeten with honey. The low blackberry should be 
used. 

DIPHTHERIA. 

This is a disease that is carrying off thousands, both 
young and old, because it is so rapid. The patient 
should be kept warm, and the throat bathed with hot 
salt and water, keeping it Avell covered in flannels, ex- 
cept to change the cloths. Gargle salt and water in 
the throat, and keep a small piece of camphor gum in 



228 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

the mouth, and if this is well done, and no exposure for 
several days, there is no danger, but there must be no 
delay. 

TO STOP VOMITING. 

Make a strong mint tea, camphor and water, or 
brandy and water, keeping a flannel wet in spirits on 
the stomach, or a mustard poultice. A little salt and 
Avater is also good. A small pill of Cayenne pepper 
will sometimes stop vomiting. A cloth, wet in the 
essence of peppermint, laid on the stomach, is some- 
times a preventive. Pigeons' gizzards are good. 
They should be powdered and made into a tea, and 
when every thing else fails, a chicken boiled four min- 
utes, and the broth given in small quantities, will stop 
vomiting. 

MUSTAKD POULTICE. 

Make a paste of Indian meal scalded, and sprinkle 
mustard over the meal, after putting on a cloth, or you 
may make it of wheat flour wet Avith vinegar, and 
spread on a cloth, then sprinkle mustard on the side to 
be applied to the flesh. 

BLEEDING AT THE NOSE. 

Hold the head on a level with the rest of the body, 
bathe the head frequently in cold water, apply a key 
or something cold to the back of the neck. Grate dried 
salt beef, and snuff" up a little. 

POLYPUS. 

Take bayberry and bloodroot, dry them and pulver- 
ize them, then take as snuff. Make a small swab, and 
dip it into the snuff and touch the diseased part as far 
as possible. 

"WAKTS. 

Rub them with fresh beef every day, or rub them 
with tobacco-juice and chalk. Strong saleratus water 
will soon destroy them. Lemon-juice is good, or bind 
on the inside of a lemon. 

CHILBLAINS. 

Where the skin is not broken, bathe in hot alum- 
water. Lime water and sweet oil are good, Rub the 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 229 

chilblain with it and dry before the fire, then wrap in 
linen. Repeat this when going to bed at night, several 
times. A cotton or linen stocking should be worn. 

TO EEMOVE PIMPLES, STIES, AND BOILS. 

To remove a sty, pull out the winker where the sty 
commences, or apply a little spirits of turpentine every 
few hours, when they first make their appearance. 

MOKTIFICATIOW. 

Apply poultices of boiled and mashed carrots, or 
yeast thickened with slippery elm, or flour. It must 
be applied warm, and often renewed ; charcoal pound- 
ed and put in the poultice is good. Give a glass of 
yeast every three or four days, and tonic bitters. 

SALT EHEUM. 

Take a quart of vinegar and four ounces of litharge, 
and boil down to half a pint; when settled, pour it off; 
stir in two ounces of sweet oil, or more, until it forms 
a consistency thicker than cream. Give things for the 
blood. 

ITCH. 

Make an ointment of lard and sulphur, oint with it 
at night before a hot fire, and in the morning wash 
thoroughly, putting on clean clothes. Continue this for 
a week, taking a tea-spoonful of sulphur mixed with a 
little molasses each day. 

DROPSY. 

Take a pint of hickory-bark ashes, mix in a pint of 
wine, and take a wine-glassful three times a day. 

SUMMMER COMPLAINT. 

Mix two large spoonfuls of pulverized rhubarb, two 
of cinnamon, two of lump-sugar, the same of French 
brandy, and half a pint of Avater. Give a tea-spoonful 
three times every hour till the complaint is checked. 
Blackberry syrup is an excellent remedy. The diet 
should be light, such as milk porridge, toast, etc. The 
little weed called camp-weed, or mouse-ear, is a sure 
remedy. Make a tea of it, and drink as occasion re- 
quires. 



230 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

BILIOUS COIilO. 

Flannel wet in hot brandy, with mustard or Cayenne 
pepper sprinkled over, and laid on the bowels, will 
often give relief. A little soda and spearmint tea is 
good. A tea-spoonfiil of Cayenne pepper, one of sugar, 
and a very little boiling water poured on, and sip hot, 
will give relief. If the bowels are inactive, give injec- 
tions. A pint of starch, half a pint of molasses, a pint 
of milk, a wine-glass of sweet oil or fresh lard, and a 
table-spoonful of salt. Thoroughwort bitters, as given 
in this book, will entirely cure this complaint if taken 

long enough. 

CHOLERA MORBUS. 

Take a tea-spooonful of soda, cinnamon cloves, pour 
on a pint of boiling water, and when nearly cold, add 
a large spoonful of brandy, and sweeten with lump- 
sugar. Give a large spoonful every half-hour. If much 
pain, give injections. 

HUMORS. 

spring beer is good, putting in plenty of yellow-dock ; 
rub a little on the face for slight eruptions, but never 
try to drive them away, for it is better for the health 
to have them come out, but diet and purify the blood. 
A little salt taken occasionally is good. Saffron is good 
to send out the humors. For boils, make a plaster of 
rye bread and honey, or flour and molasses if the for- 
mer can not be obtained ; change as often as it dries, until 
it comes to a head. Then make a poultice of bread 
and milk, and if very painful add laudanum. Epsom 
salts dissolved, and bathe the face where there are 
any eruptions, is good. 

CATARRH IN THE HEAD. 

Snuff fresh water every night and morning, and make 
a snuff of gum-arabic, gum-myrrh, and bloodroot pul- 
verized ; wash the head and neck frequently. This is 
a very common disease, and will end in consumption. 

MEASLES. 

Bathe the feet, putting a spoonful of ginger in the 
water ; keep the patient comfortably warm ; give cool- 



AND housekeeper's AID, 231 

ing drinks. It is a mistaken notion to give hot drinks 
when a person has the measles. Something is required 
to allay inflammation, not increase it. 

MUMPS. 

Bathe the SAvelling with volatile ointment, and wrap 
in cotton, being careful not to take cold. Perspiration 
kept up by warm drinks, and the bowels kept regular. 

SPINAL DIFFICULTIES. 

Bathe in tepid salt and water is good, keeping very 
quiet, not using the arms much. 

■WOKMS IN CHILDBEW. 

Sage, powdered fine and mixed with molasses, is 
good, adding a very little saleratus. Salt and water is 
good to prevent fits. 

TO REMOVE PROUD FLESH. 

Loaf-sugar pulverized very fine, and apply to the 
part. It is said to remove it without pain. Burnt 
alum is good, but causes it to smart. 

AGUE IN THE FACE. 

Make a poultice of Indian meal and poppy leaves, 
which should always be dried and put in a paper bag 
for use. Hops are also good, mustard or ginger poul- 
tices. A bag of salt heated very hot is good. 

TOOTHACHE. 

Hop water is very good to hold hot in the mouth, 
and is not injurious to the teeth. Ked pepper and cam- 
phor, laudanum, peppermint, salt, and many other 
things put in the cavity of the tooth will stop tooth- 
ache. Burnt alum is good, but the best thing is to 
have the tooth extracted, as bad teeth injure the health. 
An onion cut in two and placed upon each foot will 
give relief. 

HEADACHE. 

This is a very prevalent complaint, and arises from 
different causes. If owing to acidity in the stomach, 
a little soda will do it good. Hop tea, camomile, sage, 
Cayenne pepper, is good for nervous headache ; a few 



232 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

drops of camphor or hartshorn will sometimes give re- 
lief; bathing the feet in warm, and the head in cold 
water, putting mustard poultices on the feet, and the 
back part of the neck, is good. If it proceeds from a 
deficiency of acid in the stomach, a lemon, or a few 
drops of nitric acid, will relieve ; tie the head with a 
bandage very tight, applying a brown paper wet with 
salt and vinegar. If subject to the headache, it is ad- 
visable to die 

NEURALGIA. 

Bathing in cold water, particularly where the pain is 
located. A tea made of hops, valerian, motherwort, 
or sage, will quiet the nerves, and often afford relief. 
Camphor and water are good. 

RHEUMATISM. 

This is very much like neuralgia, and must be treat- 
ed almost in the same way. Bathing well with cold 
water, and rubbing with a flannel to get up a circula- 
tion, is good; hop tea or brisk cider with ginger is good. 
Lemons are excellent for rheumatism. 

HYDROPHOBIA. 

Wash and cleanse the wound, then apply the nitrate 
of silver to every part of it. It should be done imme- 
diately. 

STIFF JOINTS. 

For stiff joints, take strong salt and water, beeFs 
gall, one gill each, the yolk of four eggs beat up ; mix 
well together, and apply three times a day. 

QUINSY. 

Inhale the steam of hops, or wormwood and vinegar, 
and bind some on the throat, is good. Gargle the 
throat with weak lye, and if much swelled, apply a 
slippery elm or flax-seed j)oultice made with weak lye. 

TREATMENT OF COLDS. 

If feverish, bathe the feet in warm water, take some 
hot herb tea, or hot lemonade, but use no spirits, as 
this will only increase the fever. Get up a perspiration, 
and be careful about exposure the next day. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 233 

ASTHMA. 

Dissolve a jDint of saltpetre in a pint of water, dip 
sheets of fine brown paper in till they become satu- 
rated, then dry the paper. Barn a strip of it in a close 
room, having the patient exhaling the flames of it. 

FOR RHEUMATISM. 

Take two drachms of camphor, gum guiacum one 
ounce, nitre one ounce, two drachms of balsam tolu, 
one quart of spirits ; mix well, and take half a tea- 
spoonful three times a day in a little water. 

ANOTHEK. 

One pint of the best brandy, one ounce of guiacum 
powdered fine; take as much at a time as you can bear. 

FOR A SPRAINED ANKLE. 

Wash the ankle in cold salt and water, and keep the 
feet cool as possible, to prevent inflammation, and have 
it elevated on a cushion. Live on a low diet, and take 
some cooling medicine every day. 

HOARHOUND CANDY. 

Take fresh hoarhound as green as you can get it ; cut 
up stalks and all ; scald a'pitcher, then put in the hoar- 
hound, pressing it down with your hands. It should 
be two thirds full. Fill up with boiling water ; cover 
perfectly tight, to prevent any of the strength escaping 
with the steam ; set it close to the fire until it comes to 
a hard boil, then strain it and mix loaf-sugar to make 
a paste. Put it over the fire and boil until sufiiciently 
hard. Try some in water ; if crispy, it is done ; then 
make into sticks. 

SPITTING BLOOD. 

Take three spoonfuls of sage juice in a little honey, 
or two spoonfuls of nettle juice. Alum dissolved in 
water is good. 

TO PREVENT NAILS GROOVING DOWN INTO THE 

TOES. 

This is a very troublesome disease, but easily cured 
if managed rightly ; take a sharp-jpointed knife, and 



234 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

cut a furrow all along the top of the nail lengthwise ; 
when it fills up, scrape it out again. This will cause 
the nail to contract at the top, and will loosen its hold 
from the flesh. 

A CURE FOR BARBER'S ITCH. 

Take corrosive sublimate, and add oil of almonds, 
apply to the face occasionally, and a cure will soon be 
effected. 

CAMPHOR SPIRITS. 

Every family should prepare the liquid camphor for 
convenience and economy. Buy three ounces of cam- 
phor gum and a quart of alcohol ; break up the gum 
and put in a bottle ; then pour on the alcohol, and cork 
closely. It is best to take some out for use, and keep 
the larger bottle well corked. For bathing it should 
have half whisky and half alcohol put on, the alcohol 
first to cut the gum, then add the whisky. For faint- 
ness or nervous pains, pour a few drops into a wine- 
glass of water and swallow it. Peppermint should 
be likewise prepared for family use. Purchase the oil, 
and pour on alcohol to cut it. It is much cheaper than 
to get it at the druggist's. It is said that a cranberry 
bound on a corn will soon cure it. 

FOR 'WEAK EYES. 

Take rose leaves and steep till the strength is out ; 
then bottle and use as a wash. It is well to dry the 
leaves and keep in a paper bag. Cold tea is very good 
for weak eyes. Milk and water is also good. Twenty 
drops of laudanum and five of brandy in a wine-glassful 
of Avater is good ; apply three times a day, hot. 

A DRESSING FOR A BLISTER. 

Pure hog's lard, three quarters of a pound, two 
ounces of white wax ; melt in an earthen vessel ; stir 
till cold, and keep covered up close. 

TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OP BOILS. 

Take a table-spoonful of yeast in a glass of water 
twice a day. The leaven of gingerbread is good to 
put on a boil. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 235 

COHNS. 

Roast an onion in the ashes, and apply until cured. 
Dip a linen cloth in sweet oil, or, what is better, castor 
oil, and keep the part wrapped in it until a permanent 
cure is effected. This is also good for chilblains. 

CUBE FOR A COUGH. 

Take half an ounce of gum-arabic, the same of liquor- 
ice-JLiice ; dissolve the gum in warm water ; squeeze 
in the juice of a lemon; add two drachms of paregoric, 
one drachm of squills. Cork it in a bottle and shake 
well. Take one tea-spoonful when the cough is trouble- 
some. 

MEDICAL EFFECTS OF HOT -WATER. 

In bruises, hot water is good to prevent stiffness and 
discoloration ; also for removing pain. It should be 
applied as soon as possible, and as hot as it can be 
borne. Insertion in hot water will cure a whitlow, if 
done in season. 

FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

Mix a quarter of a pound of unsalted hog's lard, 
which has been washed in cold water, and then rose- 
water, with the yolks of tw^o eggs, and a large spoonful 
of honey ; add as much fine oatmeal or almond paste 
as will work into a proper consistency, and rub in well 
before going to bed. Ahnond paste is very nice for 
the skin. 

THE NAUSEOUS TASTE OF MEDICINE PREVENTED. 

Chew a little orange or lemon-peel, a clove, or any 
spice you like before taking medicine ; a peppermint 
lozenge is good, or a lump of sugar with a drop or two 
of peppermint put on. You will scarcely taste the me- 
dicine. 

TO PURIFY THE AIR OF A SICK-ROOM. 

Take six drachms of powdered nitre, and the same 
quantity of the oil of vitriol ; mix together by adding 
to the nitre one drachm of the vitriol at a time, placing 
the vessel in which you are mixing it on a hot hearth 
or plate of heated iron ; stir with a tobacco-pipe or 



236 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

glass rod ; then place the vessel in the contaminated 
room. Dr. J. C. Smith obtained £5000 from the Eng- 
lish Parliament for this recipe. Onions are good placed 
in a sick-room, although the smell is bad. Chloride of 
lime is good to cleanse a room. 

STIES TN THE EYE. 

Sties are little abscesses which form in the roots of 
the eyelashes, and are rarely larger than a pea. Bathe 
them frequently with warm water ; when they break, 
use an ointment composed Of one part citron ointment, 
and four of spermaceti well rubbed together, and apply 
along the edges of the eyelid. 

LUMBAGO, OR STIFF NECK. 

Dip a piece of flannel in scalding hot water ; sprinkle 
some turpentine on and apply to the part affected by 
the pain ; repeat this several times, and it will afford 
relief One third hartshorn to two thirds oil, and rub 
with the bare hand, is also good. 

TO MAKE PAREGORIC. 

Take opium one drachm, flowers of benzoin one 
drachm, camphor two scruples, oil of anise one drachm, 
liquorice one ounce, spirits of wine one quart. Dose, 
a tea-spoonful for an adult. 

GODFREY'S CORDIAL. 

Dissolve half an ounce of opium, one drachm of the 
oil of sassafras in two ounces of spirits of wine. Mix 
four pounds of treacle with one gallon of boiling water, 
and when cold mix together. This is the celebrated 
cordial so much used for children. 

A SYRUP FOR PURIFYING THE BLOOD. 

Take six pounds of sarsaparilla, three ounces of gum- 
guiacum, two pounds of the bark of sassafras root, two 
pounds of elder-flowers, two pounds of burdock root ; 
add one gallon of spirits and one gallon of water ; boil 
and pour off the liquor till all the strength is obtained ; 
boil down to six quarts ; add fifteen pounds of sugar. 
The spirit should not be added till boiled down to two 



AND housekeeper's AID. 237 

quarts. Yellow dock and sweet-apple tree bark should 
be added also. Put a tea-spoonful of saleratus to each 
bottle. Take a wine-glassful three times a day. 

Spirits of Turpentine will cure freezing if applied 
at once. It is also good for burns. 

A TEA-spooNFUL of castor oil and a table-spoonful of 
molasses mixed together, is a good remedy for hoop- 
ing-cough ; take daily. 

For "Scari^t Fever, bathe the patient all over in 
weak lye. 

As MUCH Cayenne pepper, taken hot, as you can 
bear, is a sure remedy for sea-sickness. 

One drop of the oil of cinnamon will cure the hic- 
cough. 

TO TAKE OUT THORNS AND SPLINTERS. 

Make a plaster of turpentine and tallow ; spread on 
leather, and apply it. A decoction of the pine tree, 
sweetened with loaf-sugar, is an excellent remedy for a 
cold. 

^WHITLOW. 

Steep in distilled vinegar, as hot as you can bear it, 
four or five times a day, for two days, then moisten a 
tobacco-leaf in the vinegar and bind round the part, and 
a cure follows. 

IMPROVED METHOD OP TAKING SENNA. 

"When steeped, put in allspice or any other kind, and 
steep with it, and it will prevent the griping for which 
senna is noted. 

FOR MEASLES, SMALL-POX, AND SCARLET FEVER. 

Take elderblows, one lemon, a tea-spoonful of cream 
of tartar ; pour on boiling water, and Avhen cold, strain, 
and give a cupful every two hours. 

FOR RHEUMATISM AND NEURALGIA. 

Make a liniment of the tincture of belladonna one 
oimce, aconite half an ounce, chloroform half an ounce. 

"WALNUTS FOR MEDICINE. 

Take when fit for pickling ; lay them in a stone jar 
with plenty of moist sugar ; place the jar in a kettle 



238 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

of boiling water, and simmer some time ; the sugar 
when dissolved should cover the walnuts. In six 
months it will be fit for use ; if older, it will be still 
better. One walnut is sufiicient for a child six years 
old, as a purgative. These should always be prepared 
where there are children. 

HUSK BEDS. 

Select the inner husks ; clip the ends, but not the 
butts ; put them in the tick ; do not split them ; once 
in two years separate all the fine husks, dust, and pieces, 
and replenish with new ones. They are preferable for 
under-beds to straw. 

DAWDELIOKT BEER. 

Take two ounces or more of dandelion roots ; after 
being well washed, boil in six quarts of water for thirty 
minutes ; strain and add a pint of molasses, half a tea- 
cupful of yeast ; let it ferment twelve hours. To be 
drank every morning and evening. 

A FEW PRACTICAL HINTS ON GAR- 
DENING. 

Every house, if possible, should have attached to it 
a good vegetable garden, it is so conducive to the 
health, happiness, and comfort of a family. A garden 
well managed will supply, with a little expense and 
trouble, a variety of nutritious and luxurious food the 
year round. Neither should the flower or fruit gar- 
den be forgotten or neglected. Every house can have 
a few trailing vines, some shrubbery and plants to 
adorn and beautify it, with little or no expense. Rose- 
bushes, lilacs, snowballs, syringa, and others are easily 
cultivated, and with their beauty and fragrance will 
contribute much to the enjoyment of home. 

TOMATOES. 

They should be sown in a hot-bed, and the last of 
May can be transplanted about four feet apart in rich 
ground. The great secret of transplanting is to do it 
in such a way as not to impede their growth. A hole 



AND housekeeper's AID. ^39 

made in the ground, and water poured in ; then set the 
plant and press the dirt around well, shading it for a 
few days, is a very good way of doing it. When the 
tomato begins to set, cut off the top vines, and the to- 
matoes will be larger and better flavored. 

CELERY 

should be sowed in a hot-bed, and transplanted in rich 
compost and earth about six inches apart, in a deep 
trench, and as they grow, di%w the earth around them, 
but not to touch the central part. It is a saline plant, 
and should be watered with salt and water. In the 
fall cover them up with earth and straw for winter use, 
or take them up carefully, so as not to break or bruise 
them, else they will rot. Lay them upright in a box 
of dry sand, and keep in the cellar. 

CAULIFIiOWER AND BROCCOLI. 

These vegetables are cultivated like the common 
species of cabbage ; grow in rich soil and occasionally 
sprinkle salt over them, the same as cabbage. Vege- 
table oysters are raised the same as other spindle- 
shaped roots. 

ASPARAGUS. 

If this is raised from the seed, it will take two or 
three years to bring it to maturity. The soil should 
be made rich ; in the fall and in the spring the earth 
should be hoed two or three inches over the beds, and 
the compost mixed in ; the weeds must be kept out, 
and when the tops are cut off, take them close to the 
surface. This plant is saline, and is benefited by 
sprinkling salt and water over. 

RHUBARB. 

This may be raised from the seed, but will take so 
long to bring to perfection that they should be started 
from the roots. It requires rich soil and good cultiva- 
tion. The leaves are poison ; the root is used for me- 
dicine. 

EGG-PLANT 

must be raised in a hot-bed, and transplanted in June, 
about two feet apart. Pepper-grass may be sown in 



240 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

drills with lettuce or alone. ISTasturtions are very pretty 

as a flower, and are used for pickle. They require a 

frame-work. 

MAKTINOES 

are easily cultivated ; pour boiling water on the seeds ; 
then plant in hills like cucumbers. When a pin will 
run through easily, they must be pickled. 

PEPPERS. 

There are many varieties of peppers, but the large 
red sweet pepper is best for pickling. They should be 
started in a hot-bed. 

SHRUBS. 

Give them a rich soil, and protect the tender ones in 
winter by covering with straw. Shrubs are generally 
obtained from cuttings, suckers, or buds. The suckers 
are young plants that shoot up around a shrub, which 
can be separated in autumn or spring, and transplanted. 
If cuttings are taken, they should be of last year's 
growth, and planted four or six inches from the end of 
the stem, or cut off the top of the stem, which is better. 
Kose-bushes should be pruned after they have done 
flowering ; cut out the old wood, shorten shoots that 
have a good bud and are healthy. If insects are trouble- 
some, steep tobacco leaves in water and sprinkle with 
it ; examine the bushes, and if any worms are found, 
kill them ; soot is good also. Never water plants when 
the sun shines ; morning and evening is best, except 
when just transplanted, when they should he kept 
shaded. Fall is the best time to set out plants or shrub- 
bery. Honeysuckles are increased by turning the ends 
downward into the ground. 

TO OBTAIN" DIFFERENT FLO^WERS FROM THE 
SAME STEM. 

Split a small twig of elder-bush lengthwise ; scoop 
out the pith ; fill with flower-seeds of diflerent sorts, 
but which blossom about the same time ; surroimd with 
mould ; tie together, and plant the whole in the earth. 

TO RESTORE FLOWERS. 

Take a bouquet which has begun to fade, and im- 
merse the ends in scalding water, deep enough to cover 



AND housekeeper's AID. 241 

one third of the length of the stem ; let them remain 
till the water is cold ; then cut oflf the ends and put 
them in cold water. 

TO HASTEN THE BLOWING- OF FLOWERS. 

Take sulphate or nitrate of ammonia four ounces, 
nitrate of potash two ounces, sugar one ounce, a pint 
of hot water, dissolve and keep in a bottle ; for plants 
in pots, add a few drops in the water when watered. 

GOOSEBERRIES. 

It must be well trimmed every spring, never allowing 
two branches to rub against each other. Dig around 
it, and enrich the soil; sprinkle soap-suds from the 
wah-tub on and around it till it blossoms. 

The currant should be cultivated in the same way, 
and the fruit will be larger and better flavored. Ashes 
applied to the roots are good. 

RASPBERRIES. 

The white and the large English raspberry are the 
best to cultivate. Set them in a moist soil, partly 
shaded, and they will produce large and well-flavored 
berries ; keep them well trimmed and supported with 
frames. 

BLACKBERRIES. 

The Lawton and the white are the best flavored, and 
are easily cultivated. Set them in rich soil and keep 
trimmed. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Set in a rich soil, with plenty of charcoal dust sprink- 
led and hoed in ; keep out the runners, and you will 
have plenty of nice large berries. Hovey's Seedling, 
and Wilson's are the most acceptable to raise. > 

DAHLIAS. 

These can be raised from the seed, but are better 
raised from the root. When they are done flowering, 
cut off" the tops and let them ripen ; if in any danger 
from frost, cover with earth five or six days ; then dig 
up and lay in a box of dry sand ; keep in the cellar if 
11 



242 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

not too damp. They must not be kept too dry nor too 
damp. Take them out in April or earlier, and put them 
in light earth to sprout. About the last of May set out 
in beds well prepared Avith rich compost ; place a stake 
near, and fasten with twine, that the wind may not 
blow them over. 

GEBANIUMS 

are easily propagated from slips ; in the summer may 
be placed out-doors ; in the winter must be potted, and 
the ground kept moist. They do not require much sun. 

CALIiAS, OR ETHIOPIAN" LILY. 

This requires much watering, except while in blos- 
som ; give it plenty of air and light. It is best propa- 
gated by suckers. 

MONTHLY EOSES. 

Water them in proportion as they receive it. They 
need plenty of sun and air. They can be hardened to 
remain out-doors in winter. 

THE CACTUS. 

The cactus should have rich soil, kept moist, particu- 
larly about the time of blossoming, when they require 
more moisture. 

DIRECTIONS FOR WASHING CALICOES. 

Black calicoes are very apt to fade, and great care 
should be used in washing them. They should either 
be washed in water where potatoes have been boiled, 
or a starch-water made by scraping two or three po- 
tatoes. Pour boiling water on wheat-bran, then strain 
it, and when lukewarm wash them in that, using no 
soap. If there are any grease-spots on calicoes, a 
little hard soap should be rubbed on before going into 
the water, as the spots can not be seen after wetting 
them. They should not be washed in very hot water, 
as they are more liable to fade. Old soft soap a year 
old, will answer as well to wash with as hard soap ; 
but new soap should never be used except for yellow. 
All colors should be rinsed well in clear water and 
dried in the shade. Alum is good to set the color of 



a:ni> housekeeper's aid. 243 

green; a little salt put in the rinsing water where 
blue, black or green are washed, will prevent the 
colors running into each other. As little soap as 
possible should be put into the water, and when cali- 
coes lade, beef's gall should be put in. They should 
be rinsed the moment they are washed, and then hung 
up to dry — never allowed to remain wet any time. 

DIRECTIONS FOR ^WASHING "WOOLENS. 

Take clear soft water, have it cold, and put a little 
soap in ; if very dirty, make quite a suds, using hard 
soap, or old soft soap. Wash them perfectly clean, 
and rinse in cold water and hang up to dry. A little 
indieo in the rinsinsr-Avater makes them look nicer. 
Colored flannels that are inclmed to fade, should be 
washed in beef's gall before washing in suds. Press 
them before they are dry. If woolens are washed in 
warm water, they should be dried in a heated room. 

DIRECTIONS FOR WASHINQ WHITE CLOTHES. 

Table-cloths or napkins that have fruit-stains or 
coffee on them, should have boiling water poured on, 
and let them remain until cold, then wash out the 
stains before putting into the suds, as soap will set 
them. If put into milk before washing, the stains will 
come out. 

Clothes wash much easier in soft water than in hard, 
and do not require as much soap. If the water is 
hard, it can be softened by putting in a little bag of 
ashes while the water is heating, or a little sal-soda. 
It is a great saving of labor to use a jDOun ding-barrel ; 
have a hot suds and pound the clothes, then wring 
them out and wash in a tub. If any streaks are left 
in, soap them and put into cold water and boil. Then 
take them out, and pour on cold water sufficient to 
put the hands in, suds well and rinse with a little 
blueing put in the water; if blueing is put in the 
water while boiling, the clothes will look clearer, and 
they will not require as much in the rinsing-water. A 
little sal-soda will take the dirt out while boiling, but 
I think it injures the texture of the cloth, and should 



S44 EXCELSIOJR COOK BOOK 

be well rinsed out ; besides, it is not good to wash 
calicoes. 

I have sometimes put a table spoonful of spirits of 
turpentine in while boiling. It makes clothes look 
clear, but is not healthy to use in that way, and I 
think the best way is to use only soap and water. 
The suds should be saved to put on shrubbery, or to 
harden walks or yards, when graveled. 

TO CLEAN WOOLEN" AND SILK SHAWLS. 

Pare and grate raw potatoes ; pour on cold water, 
and let it remain half a day ; then strain it through a 
sieve, and let the strained water settle again. Put a 
clean sheet on a table, and spread the shawl on 
smooth, pinning the corners down ; take a clean sponge 
and dip in the potato-water ; then wash it all over, and 
rinse in clear water with salt in it. Spread out to 
dry — if hung up, the colors will spread. Fold it 
quite damj^, and put a heavy weight on, and let it 
remain to dry. 

TO CLEAN SILKS AND RIBBONS. 

Take equal quantities of soft soap and alcohol and 
molasses ; mix well and lay the silk on a table, and 
rub over with the mixture, using a flannel cloth ; rinse 
in cold water and hang up to dry ; iron on the wrong 
side before it gets dry. Deer's horn sawed in small 
pieces, and boiled several hours in water, and then 
strained, is nice to dress silk with. It gives a stiffness 
and lustre almost like new. Camphene will extract 
grease, but will sometimes change the color. They 
should be dried in the open air, and ironed before 
they are entirely dry. 

TO EXTRACT GREASE FROM MERINOS, SILKS, ETC. 

Spread on magnesia or powdered chalk, and let it 
remain a few hours ; then blow off and put on more, 
and continue this until the grease is removed. 

TO RESTORE VELVETS. 

Steam them by liolding them over a kettle of boiling 
water, then pass the under side of the velvet over a 



AND HOUSEKEEPER*S AID. 245 

warm smoothing-iron. The best way for doing this is 
for one person to hokl the velvet tight, and anotlier 
pass the iron over on the wrong side, then spread the 
velvet out, and pass a soft brush over the right side. 

TO 'WASH KIGOLETTES, ^WOOLEN" SHA^WLS, AND 
ZEPHYB "WOOL. 

Put into warm water, and let it remain until nearly 
cold ; then squeeze it with white soap, lay it in a col- 
ander and set it over a pan of boiling water, and let it 
remain until cool ; then squeeze it out and shake it 
well ; then place it over another pan of boiling water, 
rinsing it up and down until the soap is rinsed off, 
then shake it well and dry fast. 

TO REMOVE MILDE^W EKOM LINEW. 

Rub it over with soap ; then scrape fine chalk or 
whitening, and rub on. Lay it in the sun, and wet it 
from time to time; if not removed, repeat the pro- 
cess. Lemon-juice and salt is also good. 

TO REMOVE INK OR IRON-RUST. 

Wet the place with sorrel or lemon-juice, and rub 
on hard white soap. As it is the acid which extracts, 
vinegar or any other acid will answer. It should be 
exposed to the heat. Colored cotton goods that have 
ink spilled on them, should be soaked in milk, either 
sour or sweet skim-milk, before wetting in water. 
Iron-rust can be taken out by applying lemon-juice 
and salt, and exposing it to the sun. A few crystals 
of oxalic acid on the spot, pour on a little warm water 
to dissolve it. It should be used Avith care, as it is 
poisonous. 

TO REMOVE SPOTS OF PITCH OR TAR. 

Scrape off all the pitch or tar you can, and then 
warm some lard, or any kind of oil will do ; rub it 
well, and let remain in a warm place two hours; then 
rub on soap and wash in suds. 

STAINS FROM BROADCLOTH. 

Grind an ounce of pipe-clay fine, and mix twelve 
di'ops of turjjentine, the same of alcohol ; rub a small 



246 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

portion of this mixture with alcohol ; then rub tho 
spots, and let it remain until dry ; then rub with a 
flannel cloth. 

STAIETS FROM SILKS. 

Salts of ammonia mixed with lime, will take out 
stains of wine from silk. It is also good to renew the 
color if there are any sjDots. 

STAIWS FROM THE HANDS. 

Mix equal proportions of oxalic acid and cream of tar- 
tar, and keep in a covered box ; when used, dip the 
fingers in warm water, and rub on a little of the pow- 
der ; when the stains disappear, wash with soap. This 
is poison, and should be kept out of the reach of child- 
ren. Lemon juice, or any acid is good to take stains 
out. 

TO TAKE STAINS FROM BLACK "WOOLEN GAR- 
MENTS OR SILKS. 

Wet the stain thoroughly with strong hartshorn, 
and if the color is not restored, repeat again next day. 
Should this also fail, wet with black ink, two success- 
ive days. Any dark silk can be done the same. 
Flowered silk may be cleaned by rubbing crumbs of 
bread on, and then brushing them off. 

TO -WASH A BLACK LACE VAIL. 

Mix beef's gall with sufficient hot water to make it 
as warm as you can bear your hand in. Do not rub 
the vail, but squeeze it through ; then rinse in two 
cold waters, the last adding a little indigo, and dry it. 
Pour water on a small |)iece of glue, put the vail in to 
stiffen it, squeeze it out and clap it ; lay it on a linen 
cloth, and make perfectly smooth, then iron on the 
wrong side. 

HEAT MARKS FROM MAHOGANY. 

Pour lamp-oil on the spots, and rub with a soft flan- 
nel cloth ; then pour on alcohol, and rub them with a 
clean soft cloth until dry. Ink may be taken out by 
putting an oxalic acid; after letting it remain a few 



AND housekeeper's AID. 24V 

minutes, rub with a cloth wet in warm water. Colored 
paint, carpets, or mahogany will require rubbing with 
hartshorn to restore the original color. 

TO EXTRACT PAINT PROM CLOTHING. 

Saturate the spots with spirits of turpentine, let it 
remain a few hours ; then rub it between the hands, and 
wash with suds and rinse. 

STARCH. 

Starch may be made of potatoes, by grating them 
and then washing the pulp in several waters and 
straining it through a sieve, then allowing it to settle 
until morning ; then pour off the water, and dry the 
starch on plates. Very nice starch can be made of 
corn in the same way. The white corn is the best. 
Poland starch is most used. Clothes that are not 
worn should never be put away in^ the starch, as it 
will rot things that are not exposed t*o the air. 

TO MAKE STARCH. 

Flour-starch is made by mixing the flour smooth 
with cold water, and then pour on boiling water, stir- 
ring all the time ; boil five or six minutes, then strain 
through a cloth or bag, kept for the purpose. Poland 
starch is made in the same way as flour, but a small 
piece of spermaceti or lard will give a glossy appear- 
ance. The best way is to dissolve an ounce of gum- 
arabic in water, and "bottle it up, and when starch is 
made, add a spoonful, and it will make linen look 
almost like those that are done up in cities. 

RICE PASTE. 

Mix rice-flour smooth with water to a thick paste ; 
then pour on more water and boil until it is thick like 
starch, stirring all the time. AYhen cool, it is nice to 
paste fine paper or pasteboard ornaments. 

FRENCH POLISH. 

Take a quarter of an ounce of gum-copal, gum-ara- 
bic, and one ounce of shell-lac ; bruise them well, and 
put into a pint of spirits of wine; put in a bottle 



248 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

and cork ; then shake well, and put in a warm place. 
In a few days they will be dissolved ; then strain 
through a piece of muslin, and keep it corked for use. 

TO MAKE HENS LAY IN WINTEE. 

Keep them in a warm place, with sand to roll in, 
and plenty of fresh water. They should have fresh 
meat occasionally, when they can not procure worms, 
and a change of food — buckwheat, corn, oats, etc. It 
is well to give them a hot mess every other day ; such 
as hot potatoes, turnips, or meal scalded ; add Cayenne 
pepper or ginger. All kinds of vegetables are good 
chopped raw, such as cabbage, carrots, turnips or po- 
tatoes. A little lime or bones burnt and pounded fine, 
and clam-shells, are good to form the shell. A box of 
ashes should always be put in their coop, or they will 
become filthy with lice. This will prevent it. Glass 
eggs, or wooden eggs painted white, should be put in 
the nest in the winter, for nest-eggs, as the hens will 
eat the eggs if left in the nests. When the chickens 
are hatched, the hen should be cooped in a garden, 
and allow the chickens to roam. They are of great 
service in a garden. Feed them on Indian meal, or 
pieces of bread soaked in water. They will almost 
get their own living in a garden. Give them plenty 
of fresh water, and buttermilk. Chickens will never 
have the gapes if not allowed to run Avhere there is 
stagnant water. I have kept fowls over twenty years, 
and have never lost a chicken with the gapes. It is 
said that vinegar that has stood in iron, is a pre- 
ventive, by putting a little in their food every day. 
Some say it is caused by worms in the throat, and that 
they may be reached and taken out with the end of a 
feather. No poultry should be kept longer than three 
years. They are best for laying the second year. 

TO POLISH MAHOGANY FUKNITUKE. 

Kub it with cold-drawn linseed oil, and polish with 
a dry, soft cloth. Do this once a week, and you will 
have a fine polish. The oil fills the pores, and hardens 
when exposed to the air, and the surface becomes much 
like glass. 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 249 

TO CLEAN PAINT. 

Put a little saleratus in the suds, and wash with a 
flannel cloth, then rinse and wipe with a linen cloth. 

TO CLEAN PAPER WALLS. 

Sweep d )^vn all the dust, and then rub with bread- 
crumbs, beginning at the top and rub down. The best 
way is to take a piece of bread. 

TO BEMOVE PAINT AND PUTTY PROM -WINDCV^- 

GLASS. 

Rub on a little spirits of turpentine, until well satu- 
rated, then wash off and rub with a woolen cloth, or 
put saleratus in hot water, to make a strong solution ; 
then let it remain until nearly dry ; then rub with a 
flannel cloth. 

CARPETS. 

Carpets should be shook often to have them wear 
well, as the dust underneath collects and wears them 
out very fast. Straw put under a car^^et makes it wear 
longer, and it will not require shaking so often. If 
there is any danger of moth, sprinkle tobacco on be- 
fore putting down the carpet. Tea-grounds sprinkled 
on a carpet before sweeping, make it look nice. 
Grated raw potatoes will answer, but the tea-grounds 
should always be saved for this purpose. If there are 
any grease -spots, rub camphene on them. Chalk, 
grated and rubbed on, with a brown paper over, and 
then place a warm smoothing-iron on. When the 
paper is soaked with grease, apply another till all is 
extracted. 

TO CLEAN BEDS AND MATTRESSES. 

When feather beds become soiled, shake all the 
feathers down into one end of the tick, and wash; then 
shake the feathers back again, and wash the other end, 
in soap-suds. Take care to rinse well. Hang on a 
line to dry. Shake well two or three times a day, 
bringing in at night. Pillows may be washed by rub- 
bing them with a soft brush dipped in warm suds ; 
then rinse well, and lay on boards to dry, shaking 
11* 



250 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

well, and turning over occasionally. Hair-mattresses 
that have become hard and dirty, should be ripped ujj, 
and the ticks washed clean. Pick the bunches out of 
the hair and put it in a dry place for a number of 
days ; then put back in the tick, and tack it. 

TO WASH CARPETS. 

Shake them well, and then tack them firmly down, 
and clean with a flannel cloth ; add one quart ox-gall to 
three quarts of soft cold water. If there are any 
grease-spots, rub some of the gall on them, and then 
wash clean with a clean cloth. If very dirty, it may 
be washed with a broom and strong soap-suds j then 
rinsed well and hung up to dry. 

CEMEIsTT FOR GLASS. 

Take ten ounces of isinglass, and dissolve it in a 
wine-glass of gin, before the fire. It should be warm- 
ed when applied, and put on with a camel's hair brush ; 
the pieces joined and then bound together with strips 
of cloth. 

^ CEMENT FOR CHINA. 

Tie some lime powdered very fine, and sifted 
through a bit of muslin, on to the broken part ; wet 
first with the white of an egg^ and then join together. 

CEMENT TO FASTEN THE HANDLES OF KNIVES 
AND FORKS. 

Take brickdust and resin ; melt together in a pip- 
khi. 

TO GILD OR SILVER LEATHER. 
To ornam.ent leather, powder some resin, and dust 
over the surface of the leather ; then lay on the leaf 
and apply hot the letters or impression you wish to 
transfer ; then dust oflT the loose metal with a cloth. 

A CEMENT FOR EARTHENWARE 

"White lead, boiled in linseed oil, is good for com- 
mon crockery or earthenware. Apply some on each 
broken piece, and join together. Let it remain till 
dry It is a good plan to keep this prepared. Boil- 



AND housekeeper's AID. 251 

ing crockery in milk will cement it. As soon as bro- 
ken, tie together and put into cold skim-milk and boil 
an hour ; then take from tlie fire and let it remain till 
the milk becomes cold, when it can be taken out, and 
put away for two or three weeks before using. 

CEMENT FOR IRONWARE. 

Beat the whites of eggs to a froth, and stir lime into 
them till thick ; then add iron filings. Fill the cracks 
with this, and let it remain a number of weeks without 
using it. Ashes and common salt made into a paste 
is good. 

TO CLEAN VIALS OR BOTTLES. 

Fill a large pot with water, and immerse the vials 
in it ; put in a shovelful of ashes, and boil an hour 
gradually; then take from the fire, and when partly 
cool, take one by one and wash in clean suds, and rinse 
in cold water. If any thing is left in that will not come 
out, put in a little shot and shake around, and then 
rinse. 

TO TEMPER EARTHENWARE OR IRON. 
Before using earthenware, put it into cold water 
and heat slowly till the water boils ; then take from 
the fire and let it remain till cold. Iron cooking uten- 
sils should be heated gradually and cooled slowly be- 
fore using. New flat-irons, stoves, or any kind of 
iron, should be treated in the same manner. 

CEMENT FOR BOTTLES OR CANS. 

Mix together a quarter of a pound of sealing-wax, 
the same of resin, and a couple of ounces of beeswax. 
When it froths, stir with a tallow candle. As soon as 
it melts, use it by covering the corks. 

TO POLISH SILVER, BRASS OR BRITANNIA. 
Whiting or chalk should be used for silverware. 
Wet first with a little water, and rub with the chalk ; 
then take a dry, fine cloth and rub dry. If stained, 
soak in soap-leys for two hours ; then cover with chalk 
wet with vinegar, and let it dry on ; then rub ofi*, and 
rub o^er with dry bran. Rotten-stone and spirits are 



252 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

best for brass. Britannia ware should be rubbed with 
a flannel rag, dipped in oil ; then washed in soap-suds 
and wiped dry. Rub with a dry flannel and chalk or 
whiting. 

TO KEMOVE BUST FKOM CUTLERY. 

Rub on a little sweet oil and let them remain a few 
days ; then rub with a flannel cloth and Bristol brick. 
New knives and forks are very apt to rust, and great 
care should be taken to have them wiped dry before 
putting away, and if not used constantly they should 
be rubbed with sweet oil, and wrapped each one in 
brown paper. Ivory handles should never be wet, but 
wijDcd with a wet cloth, or the ivory will turn yellow. 

TO KEEP CIDER SWEET. 

Put a gill of white mustard in a barrel of cider ; or 
a pint of clean wheat will keep it sweet for some time ; 
but the most effectual way is to smoke the barrels be- 
fore using with brimstone ; then rinse well and put in 
your cider. It will not taste nor smell of the brim- 
stone. When you bottle cider, put in a few raisins to 
make it brisk. 

TO PRESERVE PURS AWD FLAlSrNEIiS. 

Pack in a tight box, with camphor-gum or tobacco. 
A tallow candle is also a preventive. Woolen yarn, to 
be kept any time, should never be scoured, and the 
moths will never touch it. If moths get into a carpet, 
it is hard getting rid of them, as the eggs will hatch 
out, and the best way is to lay a wet cloth on the car- 
pet, and iron over it. The heat and steam will de- 
stroy the eggs and not injure the carpet. 

TO STAIN" BEECH THE COLOR OP MAHOGANY. 

Take a pound of logwood, and boil in four quarts of 
water, and add a double handful of walnut peelings ; 
take out the chips, and put in a pint of good vinegar, 
and it is fit for use. 

TO CLEAN" MIRRORS AND GILT FRAMES. 

Take a piece of sponge and wash clean ; then dip 
in alcohol or spi its of wine, and rub over the glass, 



^ AND housekeeper's AID. 253 

with whiting sifted on ; then take a clean cloth, and 
rub well; then polish with a silk handkerchief. Be 
very careful not to touch the frame. If the frames are 
gilt, rub over with cotton wool. This will take off 
the dust without injuring the gilding. If the frames 
are varnished, rub with spirits of wine. 
TO STAIN" HOKISr TO IMITATE TORTOISE-SHELL. 
Take an equal quantity of quicklime and red lead ; 
mix with strong lye, and lay on the horn with a small 
brush ; when dry repeat several times. 

TO PBEVENT "WATER SOAKING 
through boots and shoes, and making them wear as 
long as two pair. Take one pound of tallow, half a 
poimd of resin, and melt together ; warm the boots 
and apply until they will take no more. If a polish is 
wanted, let them dry, and then dissolve an ounce of 
beeswax, a tea-spoonful of lampblack, and an ounce of 
turpentine. Rub the boots over with this, but not near 

the fire. 

LIQUID BLACKING. 

Take a quarter of a pound of ivory-black, six gills of 
vinegar, and a table-spoonful of sweet oil, and two of 
molasses. Stir well together, and it is fit for use. 

INK FOR MARKING LINEN ^WITH TYPE. 
Dissolve one part of asphaltum in four parts of oil of 
turpentine ; add lamp-black in sufiicient^ quantity to 
render it of proper consistency to print with type. 

INK FOR MARKING LINEN. 
Dissolve two drachms of lunar caustic, half an ounce 
of gum-arabic in a gill of rain water. Wet the article 
to be marked in saleratus water, and dry ; then pass a 
hot flat over, to make it smooth ; then mark, and pass 
a hot flat over again. It should be corked tight and 
kept in the dark. 

ANOTHER. 

Take four drachms of lunar caustic, four ounces of 
water, sixty drops of nutgalls made strong by being 
pulverized and steeped in water. 



254 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

FOR MAKING BLACK INK. 

Take four ounces of nutgalls, two of copperas, one 
of gum-arabic ; put the galls in a quart of water ; soak 
eight or nine days where it will be warm, shaking it 
often ; then add the copperas and gum, also half an 
ounce of alum well dissolved in warm water. It will 
be fit for use in a few days. 

TO PRESERVE GRASSES, 

Make a solution of alum water, a piece of alum the 
size of a hen's egg to a quart of water. Dip the grasses 
in, and then sprinkle with flour ; they look quite pretty 
in the winter season, put in a vase with a few ever- 
lastings. Fruit and flowers may be preserved by dip- 
ping them into a solution of gum-arabic two or three 
times, allowing them to dry each time. They must be 
entirely immersed or they will not keep ; tie a string 
to them and let into the liquid. 

BLUE INK. 

Dissolve a little indigo in oil of vitriol ; dissolve a 
little gum-arabic in water, and add to it. 

RED INK. 

Boil an ounce of Brazil wood in half a pint of water 
for a quarter of an hour ; add an ounce of alum and 
three drachms of gu.m-arabic. 

Scarlet ink is made by dissolving vermilion in a so- 
lution of gum-arabic. Green ink may be made by mix- 
ing two ounces of verdigris, one ounce of cream of tar- 
tar, half a pint of water ; boil until reduced one half; 
then filter. 

TO MAKE PLASTER OP PARIS FIGURES LOOK 
LIKE ALABASTER. 

Dip the figures in a strong solution of alum water 

TO KEEP A^WAY HOUSEHOLD VERMIN. 

Sage put around where ants frequent is a preventive. 
It is said that the rattles of a rattlesnake Avill keep them 
away. Hellebore rubbed with molasses, and put in 
places wh-ore cockroaches frequent will soon destroy 



AND housekeeper's AID. 255 

them. Flies can be thinned by putting strong soap-suds 
in a tumbler, and then put a piece of board on top with 
a hole in the middle, and a little molasses on the under 
side. The molasses will draw the flies, and they will 
fall into the water. 

To KEEP AWAY mosquitocs, attach a piece of flannel 
to the top of the bedstead, wet with camphorated 
spirits, and they will leave the room. 

Foe bed-bugs, get a sixpence worth of corrosive sub- 
limate ; put it in a bottle, and add a gill of whisky ; 
shake it up well, and then take a feather and put it 
around the bedstead twice a year, and you will never 
be troubled with bugs. Red peppers boiled in water 
and the bedstead washed in the water is good, but I 
have never tried any thing so efiectual as the corrosive 
sublimate ; the bottle should be marked poison. Spear- 
mint put around places where mice infest will drive 
them away, as they have a great aversion to it. 

GKAFTING. 

Melt beeswax and tallow together, stirring in a little 
chalk, if handy. While hot, dip in some strips of rags, 
and put on so as to prevent the escape of the sap or the 
introduction of water. 

TO MAKE COURT-PLASTEK. 

Suspend black silk or white on a frame ; then dis- 
solve isinglass and apply with a brush ; let it dry, and 
then repeat it ; then cover with a strong tincture of 
balsum of Peru. This is the real English court-plaster. 
The more common is covered with the white of an egg. 

TO MAKE BLACKING. 

One pound of ivory-black, well pulverized, half a 
pound of loaf-sugar, half an ounce of oil of vitriol, six 
ounces of sweet oil, one gallon of vinegar ; stir it weU^ 
and it produces a fine polish. 

OIL OF FLO^WERS. 

Take thin pieces of cotton Avadding and dip in pure 
Florence oil or sweet oil, and lay in a china dish ; cover 
it thick with rose-leaves, or any flowers from which 



256 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

you wish to get perfume. Lay on another layer steeped 
in oil, and continue this until full ; cover it closely, and 
set in the sun a week. Take out the leaves and squeeze 
the oil in vials. 

A DELICATE CEMENT FOB GLASS OK CHINA. 

One ounce of mastic put in as much spirits of wine 
as will dissolve it ; soak an ounce of isinglass in water 
until soft ; then dissolve in rum or alcohol till it forms 
a glue ; add a quarter of an ounce of gum ammonia, 
well rubbed and mixed. Put the two mixtures together 
over a gentle heat until united ; then keep in a vial well 
corked. When used, place in a kettle of warm water ; 
warm the articles to be mended; apply the cement 
and put tight together for several hours, and it will be 
scarcely perceptible. 

•WASHING KECIPE. 

Mix a gill of alcohol with a gallon of soft soap ; mix 
ivell, and apply the soap in the usual way, letting them 
remain several hours in the suds ; then wash in the 
usual way and boil ; they will require very little rub- 



bing. 



ANOTHER. 



Take four ounces of borax ; pour four quarts of boil- 
ing water on, and when dissolved, add three pints of 
soft soap. Use as above. 



ANOTHER. 



One ounce of borax, eight quarts of water, one pint 
of soap ; boil all together twenty minutes ; when partly 
cool, soak the clothes over night in some of it. Wash 
the next morning ; boil and rinse. 



ANOTHER. 



Pour two quarts of boiling water on half a pound of 
soda ; then take half a pound of hard soap cut fine ; put 
on the fire with two quarts of cold water ; when dis- 
solved, add the soda ; mix well, and let it stand till 
cold. Soak your clothes, rubbing the seams and dir- 
tiest parts some ; let them remain until morning ; then 



AND housekeeper's AID. 257 

wring them out, or boil in the same water if you like, 
but add a pint of the soda liquid, and boil twenty min- 
utes ; then rinse, and the clothes will look well. A little 
spirits of turpentine put into clothes while boiling makes 
them look clear. 

TKANSPAKENT JAP AW VARNISH. 

Eight ounces of oil of turpentine, six ounces of oil of 
lavender, one drachm camphor, two ounces bruised 
copal ; dissolve the Avhole. To be used for tin- ware. 

TO REMOVE MILDE-W. 

Pour a quart of boiling water on two ounces of chlo- 
ride of lime ; then add three quarts of cold water, and 
soak the linen in it twelve hours. This is preferable to 
any other recipe that I have seen. 

TO CliEAN AVHITE FEATHERS. 

Wash them in soft water with white soap, and blue ; 
rub them through white paper, and beat them on paper ; 
then shake them before the fire ; dry them in the air, 
and curl them. 

TO CURL FEATHERS. 

Heat them gently before the fire ; then with the back 
of a knife applied to the feather they will curl quickly. 

TO CLEAN" KID GLOVES. 

Take a little camphene and a small piece of camphor 
and rub on with a piece of sponge, having the glove on 
the hand ; wet it as little as possible ; then lay on a 
clean towel, and wipe with a dry cloth ; blow in the 
fingers, and hang up to dry, or keep on the hands till 
dry. Sometimes a crust of stale bread will clean, if 
not too dirty. If greasy, a little magnesia is good. A 
piece of India rubber is good to keep them clean. 

TO BLEACH WOOL, SILK, AND STRAW. 

Take a barrel and put a small kettle or basin in, with 
pounded brimstone in it ; take live coals and put in, or 
it is best to put the coals in first, then the brimstone on 
top. Hang the straw on a stick and put across the 
barrel, and cover tight. Flannels that you wish to 



258 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

bleach, put on top ; coutiime this till they are bleached 
white ; let them lie loose. The straw should be soaked 
in pearlash water until yellow before putting in. Brim- 
stone will take stains out of cotton or linen goods by 
holding them over. 

TO DYE GLOVES. 

Put them on the hands and take a soft brush ; dip 
into any dye you wish to color them, wetting them as 
little as possible. For a York tan, steep saffron several 
hours in hot water, and wet with either a soft brush or 
sj)onge. 

KNIVES AWD FOKKS. 

Clean ebony handles with a soft cloth dij^ped in sweet 
oil ; after laying awhile, wif^e with a clean towel. 
Ivory handles should be washed with a flannel, soaped, 
using warm water ; then wipe dry with a towel ; soak 
occasionally in alum water to preserve their whiteness ; 
the water must be cold ; let them lie an hour in it ; 
then take them out and brush them. Wet a towel in 
cold water, squeeze out, and wrap around the handles, 
leaving them in to dry gradually ; if dried too fast out 
of the alum water, they will be injured. This will make 
them very white. 

A CHEAP PAINT. 

Take one bushel of unslacked lime and slack with 
cold water ; add twenty pounds of Spanish whiting, 
seventeen pounds of salt, and twelve pounds of sugar ; 
strain through a wire sieve, and it will be fit for use 
after reducing with cold water. This is for outside 
buildmgs. Put two coats on wood and three on brick ; 
let each coat dry before putting on another. For paint- 
ing inside, use only five pounds of salt and three of 
sugar. Make it any color you please ; for green, use 
chrome green ; for lead and slate, use lampblack ; for 
yellow, ochre and chrome yellow. 

TO MAKE A SIMPLE 'WHITE PAINT. 

Skim-niilk, two quarts, eight ounces of unslacked 
lime, six ounces of oil, white Burgundy pitch two 
ounces, Spanish white three pounds ; the lime to be 



AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 259 

slacked in water exposed to the air ; mix in about one 
fourth of the milk ; the oil, in which the pitch is to be 
previously dissolved, must be added a little at^ tmie ; 
then the rest of the milk, and afterward the Spanish 
white. This quantity will cover twenty yards, two 
coats, and the expense will not be more than tenpence. 

FOR SCOURING BOARDS. 

Use three parts of sand and one of lime ; no soap is 
required. 

WHITEWASH OF THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE 
IMPROVED. 

Take half a bushel of unslacked lime and slack it 
with boiling water ; cover it tight ; stram it and add 
a peck of salt dissolved in warm water ; three pounds 
of o-round rice boiled to a thin paste ; put m boiling 
hot half a pound of Spanish whiting, and a pound ol 
clear glue, dissolved in warm water ; mix, and let it 
stand several days ; then put it in a kettle and heat it 
hot, and put on with a brush. 

A SIMPLE WHITEWASH. 
Take unslacked lime and slack by pouring on boiling 
water ; cover tight, and when cool enough, put on with 
a brush. A handful of salt will make it look nice, but 
it is more hable to scale off. A little skim-milk is good 
to thin it with. If your walls are very smoky, i)ut m 
a little ashes for the first coat. A little blueing m the 
second coat looks well. 

TO SEPARATE BEESWAX FROM THE COMB. 
Put it in a pan with holes in the bottom, and set it 
in the oven or a grate ; put another pan under, half-lull 
of water ; the wax will melt and drop in the water, 
when it can be taken out. 

ANOTHER. 

Tie it in a bag and put it in a kettle of water, with a 
weight on top. The wax will rise to the top, when it 
can be taken off. 



260 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

POISONS. 

Every person should endeavor to inform themselves 
of the nature and antidotes of poison. It is generally 
so sudden that a few hours' waiting for medical aid 
might prove fatal, as it will admit of no delay. The 
first thing is to find out what has been taken : the next 
is to use remedies, and if one fails, try others. 

ANTIDOTE FOR ACIDS. 

Acids cause great heat and a burning sensation in 
the mouth and stomach, an inclination to vomit, hic- 
cough, a burning thirst, great pain in the bowels, and 
soreness. Give an ounce of magnesia in a pint of water, 
a wine-glassful every two minutes. Soda or saleratus, 
dissolved in plenty of water, is also good, but the mag- 
nesia is better. Flax-seed tea, rice water, or water 
alone is good. An ounce of soap dissolved in a pint 
of water, and given, a wine-glassful every two minutes, 
is good. No nourishment should be taken but sweet- 
ened rice-water for several days. 

ALKALIES. 

They are the reverse of acids, and acids are given as 
a remedy ; two table-spoonfuls of vinegar or lemon-juice 
in water ; then drink large quantities of soap and water. 

ARSENIC. 

Symptoms : vomiting and convulsions. Give ipecac 
or something to assist vomiting — large doses of cold 
water and sugar. Hydrated peroxide of iron, charcoal, 
magnesia, chalk, lime-water, and whites of eggs are 
also good. 

TARTAR EMETIC. 

Peruvian bark or white oak. 

OPIUM OR LAUDANUM. 

Dash cold water on the head ; give strong tea or 
coffee, and acid drinks ; give a dose of Cayenne pepper 
or mustard and water alone, and keep the patient in 
motion. Sometimes a table-spoonful of vin«^o"ar will 
relieve. 



AND housekeeper's AID. 261 

PKUSSIC ACID. 

Hot brandy and water, hartshorn, soda, or turpen- 
tine. It is said that immersing the patient in cold 
water will neutralize this poison. 

MUSHROOMS. 

Mix three grains of tartar emetic, twenty-five of 
ipecac, and an ounce of salts dissolved in a glass of 
water. Give by degrees till it vomits the patient ; then 
give vinegar and water. 

SALTPETRE. 

Give emetics and plenty of rice-water, flax-seed tea, 
milk and water. 

CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE. 

Give whites of eggs mixed with water, or soap and 
water freely. 

SNAKE BITES, OR MAD DOG. 

Apply a ligature above the part bitten ; then apply 
a cupping-glass, or it is better to cut out the bite, and 
then burn with caustic ; put in a piece of cotton satu- 
rated with it. As soon as it is cut take off the ligature. 
A decoction of Spanish flies and turpentine should be 
applied to the skin around the wound to excite inflam- 
mation and suppuration. Keep up the discharge of 
matter some time. Charcoal made into a paste with 
hog's lard is a good antidote for the bite of snakes ; so 
is the bark of yellow poplar ; bruise it ; then make a 
poultice of it and apply to the wound ; bathe all around 
the part that is bitten with a strong decoction of the 
same, and drink a pint every hour. 

ALCOHOL. 

Give an emetic and dash cold water on the head ; 
give ammonia. 

VERDIGRIS. 

Give white of egg and plenty of water. 

CHARCOAL. 

Many persons are killed by sleeping in apartments 
where coal is burnt, on account of the ciarbonio gas. 



262 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

Remedy : remove the patient to the open air ; dash 
cold water on the head and body ; stimulate the lungs 
and nostrils by hartshorn ; at the same time rub the 
chest briskly. 

NITKATE OF SILVEB. 

Give a strong solution of common salt, and then 
emetics. 

TOBACCO. 

Give an emetic ; then strong dose of tea. 

LEAD. 

Give Epsom salts or some carthartic ; if the symp- 
toms continue, do as directed for acid. In almost all 
cases of poison, emetics should be administered the first, 
and whatever you have on hand ; ground mustard stir- 
red up in warm water, may be given every few minutes, 
until the patient vomits freely. 

VABNISH TO MAKE "WOOD LOOK LIKE IVOBY. 

Take half an ounce of isinglass ; boil gently in half a 
pint of water ; when dissolved, strain it and add flake 
powder till it becomes white as cream ; give the wood 
three or four coats of this, letting each coat dry before 
putting the other on ; then smooth it with a damp rag. 
If when mixed it looks too white, add a few grains of 
carmine white or chrome yellow. 

CEMENT FOB GLASS OB AT^OOD. 

Dissolve common glue, and add to it finely-sifted 
wood ashes till quite thick ; then apply while hot, and 
press the sides firmly together. This is said to be very 
adhesive to wood. 

CEMENT FOE GLASS. 

Boil one ounce of isinglass in two mne-glassfuls of 
spirits of wine. 

FOB BOSE-BUSHES. 

Take the soot from the chimney, and pour on water ; 
let it remain until the strength is entirely out ; then 
sprinkle your bushes with the liquor, and it will prevent 
the worm from injuring them. As soon as the worm 



'" — 263 



AND HOUSEKEEPER S AID. 

makes its appearance, the leaves should be carefully ex- 
amined, and every worm destroyed, or they will m a 
short time destroy the bush. 

TO MAKE CABBAGES OB ASPABAGUS GROW. 

Sprinkle salt over cabbage occasionally while head- 
ing, and the heads will be firmer and much larger. _ It 
is also a great improvement to asparagus. Old brme 
which has been used for other purposes is good. 

CEMENT FOR WOOD. 
Take beeswax and resin, equal quantities ; naelt them 
and add powdered chalk, imtil sufficiently thick. A 
strong solution of glue and whiting makes a good ce- 
ment for ivory. ^ ^ 
TO COLOR GOLD. 

Make a solution of two ounces of saltpetre, two of 
alum, and one of sal-ammoniac, and dip the article m to 
be colored. 

TO WASH DELAINES OR CALICOES THAT FADE. 

Pour boiling water on wheat bran, and let it remain 
until nearly cold ; then strain, and it is ready for use. 
You will require no soap. It will make delames look 
like new. 

SUBSTITUTE FOR COURT-PLASTER. 

Clean ho^s' feet as for cooking ; boil to a jelly ; then 
spread on silk, and it will be equal to any adhesive 
plaster used. , 

TO PREVENT INSECTS FROM DESTROYING ROSE- 
BUSHES. 

Take one peck of soot, one quart of unslacked lime, 
three gallons of water, and let it remain twenty-fom- 
hours ; when the soot rises to the surface, skim it ott. 
Use a syringe for applying the water. 

MAKING SOAP. 

Take a barrel without a bottom ; set it on a large 

fiat stone or plank, with a channel cut for the lye to 

run Or, what is still better, have a pme tub made 

at the cooper's, larger at the top than at the bottom. 



264 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

Have a large hole bored about two inches from the 
bottom, with a plug to fit in. Put in the bottom straw, 
then a peck of lime, and fill up with good wood-ashes. 
(Any hard green wood makes good ashes.) If you 
have a tub made, it will last many years, and is much 
more convenient than a barrel. If the ashes are wet 
while packing in the tub, it will get to running much 
sooner. Make a hole in the middle of the tub and 
pour on "w^ater. Hot water will get the strength out 
sooner than cold. Five bushels of good ashes will 
make a barrel of soap. When they have been well 
soaked, take out the plug and the lye will run off clear ; 
if not, pour back on the leach until it does. It must 
bear up an egg plump, or it will not make soap. Use 
the first to eat up the grease ; the weaker will answer 
to fill up. 

Put all your grease in a large iron kettle, and make a 
slow fire under it ; stir with a stick constantly, until it 
IS warmed through ; then pour in your strongest lye ; 
a pailful first, and stir well. Watch it carefully or it 
will boil over ; if it does, add more lye, and continue 
this until the grease is entirely eaten up. Strain it into 
a harrel while hot, and fill up as fast as you draw off 
jonv lye, and you will have good soap. Should your 
ly^ be too strong to make it come soap, add a pail of 
water. Another way is to cleanse all your grease and 
put it in a barrel and pour on your lye ; in a few weeks 
you will have nice white soap. Another method is to 
have half a barrel of lye, and put in- your grease 
through the year, and at the end you will have a bar- 
rel of soap without any trouble. 

To cleanse grease, put in a little strong lye, and boil 
it thoroughly ; then fill up with cold water and the 
grease will float ; then skim off. 

POTASH SOAP. 

Take twenty-five pounds of grease melted, eighteen 
pounds of potash dissolved in four pails of water ; boil 
till dissolved ; put the grease and two pails of hot lye 
in a barrel, the next day two more, and the next two 
more; then fill up the barrel — a pailful of hot wat^r 



AND housekeeper's AID. 265 

eac^ day — stirring it well, and it will be good soap. 
The sediment of the potash is not good. 

HAKD SOAP. 

Put to a pail of nice soft soap, one pint of salt ; boil 
It, and then take it off and stand until cold ; when hard, 
lake from the lye and heat slowly. If you wish to 
have it yellow, add palm-oil, and pour in wooden ves- 
sels. When cold, separate it again from the lye, and 
cut in bars. Let them stand in the sun to dry. 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

Take sixteen pounds of soft soap, boil two hours with 
twelve pounds of salt, and it will make ten pounds of 
hard soap. When melted over as the above recipe, 
add a little resin. Scent it with fragrant oil if you 
like. 

BAYBERKY AND MYRTLE SOAP. 

Dissolve two pounds and a quarter of white potash 
in five quarts of water. Boil over a slow fire ten 
pounds of bayberry, tallow or myrtle wax, with it; 
then add a tea-cup of cold water, and boil ten minutes ; 
scent with any fragrant oil, and turn in moulds to dry. 
Let it remain a week or more ; then remove it. This 
is good for chapped hands ; also for shaving. 

CASTILE SOAP 

Is made by boiling common soft soap three hours and 

a half in lamp-oil. 

"WINDSOR SOAP. 

Slice the best white soap and melt it over a slow 
fire ; when melted take off, and when lukewarm add 
oil of caraway, or any other fragrant oil. Turn into 
moulds and let it remain in a dry place a week. 

TRANSPARENT SOAP. 

Take equal parts tallow soap, made perfectly dry, 
and spirits of wine ; put into a copper still, and plunge 
into a water-bath furnished with its capital and refrig' 
eratory. The heat applied to effect the solution, 
should be as slight as possible, to avoid evaporating too 
much of the alcohol. The solution being effected, it 
12 



260 BXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

must settle, and after a few hours the clear liquid is 
drawn off into tin frames, into forms desired for the 
cakes of soap. It will not be transparent until several 
weeks' exposure to dry air. It is colored with strong 
alcoholic salution of ochre for the rose tint, and tur- 
meric for the yellow. 

NICE SHAVING SOAP. 

Take one pound of old Windsor soap, a quarter of a 
pound of Castile soap, a gill of lavender-water, a gill 
of cologne, and a very little alcohol. Boil until thor- 
oughly mixed. 

TO CLEAN SILK. 

Take a quarter of a pound of soft soap, a tea-spoon- 
ful of brandy, and a pint of gin ; with a sponge wash 
each side ; then wash in two or three waters, and iron 
on the wrong side. 

^SVASH-BALLS. 

Take three quarters of a pound of Castile soap, cut 
thin, two ounces of alcohol, one ounce of borax, half 
a pound of Indian meal ; mix and dissolve by gentle 
heat ; add any perfume you like, and make into balls. 
This is excellent for the skin. 

DBESSING SKINS ^VITH THE FTTR ON. 

As soon as the skin comes from the animal, stretch 
it on a board, flesh side out ; then apply an equal mix- 
ture of salt and alum, pulverized together. Let them 
remain some time ; then wash in warm soapsuds ; dry 
moderately ; rub soft with the hands. 

HONEY SOAP. 

Take a quarter of a pound of honey, a quarter of a 
pound of the otto of citronella, and twenty-five pounds 
of melted bar soap. It should be put in an iron ves- 
sel, and set into another of hot water, to be melted. 
This is very nice for the skin. 

ALMOND SOAP. 

Take a quai'ter of a pound of the otto of almonds, and 
twenty-five pounds of melted bar soap. A very small 
quantity of water should be added while melting ; stir 



AXD HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 267 

with a stick until it becomes smooth ; then it may be 
perfumed or colored; then pour into bars, cut in 
squares and stamped. Vermilion dyes soap pink, and 
smalt a blue color. 

KOSEMARY SOAP. 

Take one and a half pounds of the essential oil of 
rosemary, and sixty pounds of melted soap ; proceed 
as for almond soap. 

HARD SOAP. NO. 2. 

Take three fourths of a pound of fresh slacked lime, 
one gallon of water ; dissolve one pound of sal-soda m 
another s^allon of water, and boil all together fifteen 
minutes f then let it settle. A white precipitate of 
chalk will fall at the bottom of the vessel, and the clear 
liquid will be a caustic lye ; pour this off, and boil your 
grease till it becomes soap, then pour into moulds, and 
when cold it will be hard soap. The secret of makmg 
soap is to have an alkaline lye of sufficient^ strength, 
and continue boiling until the chemical union of the 
grease and alkali is effected. 

Resin is used for common hard soaps, as it unites 
with alkalies and tends to make soap harder than 
grease alone. White soap should be made of tallow. 
Any family may prepare their own fancy soap by 
melting good bar soap in a tin vessel, placed in a ket- 
tle of water, and adding any of the essential oils, at 
the rate of one ounce of oil to five pounds of soap. 
Whenever the oil is mixed with the melted soap, it 
must be cooled quickly or the perfume will evaporate. 
Otto of roses, musk, lavender, bergamot, or almost any 
kind, may be used. 

FOR DYEING. 

Light colors should be colored in brass or tin ; dark 
coloi? in iron. Materials should be clean and free from 
jrrease. Wet them so that they will not spot, and 
rinse well, that they may be free from suds. 

COCHINEAL TO COLOR ^WOOLEN OR SILK. 

Pound two ounces of cochineal fine, and pour on 
cold water sufficient to wet two pounds of cloth, (for 



268 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

it will color that quantity ;) let it boil up in brass or tin ; 
then add four ounces of muriate of tin, one of cream ot 
tartar ; wet your clothes in warm water, and put in ; 
stir well and take out, and dry in the shade, and you 
will have a beautiful color. 

TO COLOR YELLOW ON COTTON. 

For six pounds of cotton goods, use nine ounces of 
sugar of lead, six of bichromate of potash ; wet the 
goods thoroughly in cold water, dissolve the potash in 
a tin vessel with four quarts of cold water, the sugar 
of lead in as much, but keep them separate. Dip the 
goods into the sugar of lead, and wring out then in the 
l^otash, and you will have a splendid color. If required 
deeper, dip in the sugar of lead again, then in the pot- 
ash, several times alternately ; then dry in the shade. 

TO COLOR ORANGE. 

Make a strong lime-water as for whitewashing. It 
should be made the day before wanted. Let it settle, 
for if there is any settles it will not color. The stronger 
the lime water the better color you will have. Put 
some in an iron kettle, and when it boils dip in the yel- 
low which you have just colored, while Avet ; stir well 
with a stick, and take out ; hang up to dry. It must 
be done very quickly or it will be spotted. 

TO COLOR COTTON LEMON COLOR. 

To two pounds of cloth take six ounces of sugar of 
lead dissolved in a pailful of hot water ; four ounces of 
bichromate of potash in a pailful of cold water. Dip 
your cloth in the lead water first, then in the potash 
water, several times back and forth. Dry in the shade. 
TO COLOR GREEN COTTON GOODS. 

Color yellow by the recipe below, and dip in the 
chemical blue, and hang up to dry in the shade. 
These colors must all be cold, and they will not fade. 

TO COLOR BLUE COTTON GOODS. 

Use the chemical boxes of blueing. No certain rule 
can be given, as some boxes are much better than oth- 
ers. Use cold water, and dip your goods in cold 



AND HOUSEKEEPEB*S AID. 269 

water first, then in the bhie, and if not deep enough 
add more blue ; wring out and dry in the shade. It 
will not color woolen. 

TO DYE BLACK. 

To each pound of goods to be dyed allow a pound 
of logwood chips, or a quarter of a pound of extract 
of logwood, a small bit of copperas, and sufficient vin- 
egar to wet the goods. If the chips are used, put in a 
bag, and soak over night in an iron vessel ; then heat 
it next day and add the vinegar and copperas. Wet 
the goods in hot water and put in ; let them steep 
all day ; take out two or three times and air, or they 
may remain another day ; wash until the dye will not 
come off. 

ANOTHER. 

Take the common horse sorrel, and steep in an iron 
kettle two or three hours ; then put in half a pound of 
the extract of logwood, and have your goods perfectly 
clean ; dip in a strong soapsuds before putting in; then 
let them steep all day ; take out and air several times ; 
then wash as above. This will color three pounds of 
woolen goods. 

SLATE COLOR. 
One paper of ink-powder, one quart of vinegar, and 
water enough to wet the goods. It must be done in 
brass. This makes a beautiful slate color. Sugar-loaf 
paper boiled in water and set with alum, makes a pur- 
ple slate color ; but it is difficult to obtain now, as sug- 
ar does not come in loaf at the present time. Tea- 
grounds boiled in iron and set with copperas, will 
make a slate, both for cotton and woolen. Birch bark, 
or black walnut bark, boiled in brass, and set with cop- 
peras, makes a nice color. Set with alum, the birch 
bark will make a bright nankeen color. 

ROYAL PURPLE. 

Soak logwood chips in soft water until the strength 
is out; then add alum — a tea-spoonful to a quart of the 
liquor. If not bright enough, add more alum. Rinse 
and dry. When the dye is exhausted, it will color a 
fine lilac. 



270 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

BLUE OR GREEN PER POUND. 

Take one ounce and a half of the oil of vitriol, a 
quarter of an ounce of Spanish indigo, which will an- 
swer just as well as the East-India indigo, which is 
much higher. Stir well together, and add a lump of 
pearlash of the size of a pea. As soon as the fer- 
mentation ceases, bottle it, and it w^ill be fit to use the 
next day. Be careful not to let it get on cotton cloths, 
or it will eat them. Chromic blue is made in the same 
way, only using half the quantity of vitriol. This dye 
will only answer for silk and woolen goods. For blue, 
have your water warm, and add some of the mix- 
ture ; put in your cloth without crowding, and let it 
remain till colored, keeping it warm but not boiling. 
Do not wring them, but drain ; then hang up to dry in 
a shady place. When dry, wash them in lukewarm 
suds to prevent the vitriol from injuring them. For 
green, mix the above mixture with yellow dye, but do 
not let it boil. It must be used Avith care, as it is 
poison. 

A NANKEEN COLOR. 

A pailful of lye, with a piece of copperas as big as a 
hen's egg boiled in it, will produce a nankeen color that 
will not fade. 

YELLOW DYES. 

Take equal parts of common potash and annotto ; 
boil in soft water. When dissolved, take it from the 
fire, let it cool, and put in the goods ; set them by the 
fire, and let them remain until the right color. To 
dye an orange color, tie annotto in a bag, and squeeze 
it in soapsuds ; put in your goods and boil until the 
proper shade ; drain them, but not wring, and dry in 
the shade. When dry, wash in soapsuds. Fustic col 
ors a nice yellow ; hickory bark, peach leaves or saf- 
fron, set with alum, make a good yellow color. 

TO COLOR MADDER. 

Prepare a brass kettle with two gallons of water ; 
bring it to a steady heat ; then add three ounces of 
alum, and one ounce of cream of tartar ; put in your 
cloth, and steep two hours ; then take out and rinse in 



AND housekeeper's AID. 2Vl 

cold water. Empty your kettle, and fill with as much 
water as before ; then add your madder, and rub well 
before putting in your cloth. When the dye is as warm 
as you can bear your hand in, put in the cloth, and let 
it remain an hour, and keep a steady heat ; keep it in 
motion constantly ; then boil fifteen minutes ; air and 
rinse it. This will color one pound. 

SCARLET. 

Dip the cloth in a solution of alkaline or metallic salt, 
then in a cochineal dye, and let it remain some time, 
and it will come out permanently colored. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Half a pound of madder, half an ounce of cream of 
tartar, one ounce of marine acid to one pound of cloth. 
Put all together, and bring the dye to a scalding heat. 
Put in your cloth, and it will color in ten minutes. 
The dye must only be scalding hot. Rinse in cold 
water. 

CINIfAMON. 

For twenty-four yards of woolen cloth, take three 
pounds of ground camwood, three pecks of butternut 
bark ; put your water in a kettle, and let it boil to ex- 
tract the strength; put in your cloths, and simmer 
slowly one hour ; stir often ; take it out and air it ; then 
put back, and let it remain as long again. If not dark 
enough, dissolve a little copperas and put in. Boil a 
few minutes, and rinse in cold water. Butternut bark, 
or the bark off the nut, makes a very pretty color, set 
with alum. The color is very much like Scotch snuff. 

TO COLOB CARPET RAGS ALL ONE COLOR. 

Take dark woolen rags, and boil, or simmer rather, 
in a dye of redwood and madder, half and half; soak 
the madder in vinegar over night, and set the color 
with alum ; boil in brass. After taking out the woolen 
rags, put in the calicoes and boil. If not deep enough, 
add more redwood. 

TAN. 

Put the cloth in the vats, and let it remain four or 
five days ; then dip in a strong limewater, and rinse in 



272 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

cold "water and dry, or you may get some of the tan- 
ner's liquid, and heat boiling hot, and put in your cloth 
and color in a day. 

FOR THE TOILET. 

FOB REMOVING FRECKLES. 

Take one ounce of rectified spirits of wine, a tea- 
spoonful of muriatic acid, applied with a camel's hair 
brush, two or three times a day. 

ANOTHER. 

Use burnt alum and lemon-juice. 

ANOTHER. 

One ounce of bitter almonds, the same of barley flour ; 
mix with honey, and anoint at night, wash off in the 
morning. 

CHAPPED LIPS. 

By the frequent use of honey-water, and protecting 
the lips from the cold, they will be speedily cured. This 
is also good for chapped hands. Apply it at night, upon 
retiring to bed, and put on kid gloves. 

LIP SALVE. 

To a pint of white vinegar, put an ounce of lavender 
flowers ; add the rind of a lemon cut thin ; steep twenty- 
four hours in a stone jar ; then filter, and put in a bot- 
tle, corking tight. 

LEMON CREAM FOR SUNBURN AND FRECKLES. 

Put two spoonfuls of fresh cream into half a pint of 
milk ; squeeze in the juice of a lemon, half a glass of 
brandy, a little alum and loaf-sugar ; boil the whole, 
and skim well, and when cool it is fit for use. 

LOTIONS FOR WRINKLES. 

Take a weak barley-water, one pint ; strain it, and 
add twelve drops of balm of Mecca ; shake it well to- 
gether, till the water assumes a whitish appearance. 
Wash the face in soft water, and then apply once a 
day. It will beautify the face, preserve the freshness 
of youth, and give a brilliancy to the skin. 



«^ AND HOUSEKEEPER'S AID. 2^3 

TO IMPROVE THE SKIN OP THE HANDS AND 
, 9 ARMS. 

Take equal weights of Venice soap and lemon-juice ; 
when dissolved, add one ounce of the oil of bitter al- 
monds, and an ounce of the oil of tartar. Mix well till 
it has acquired the consistency of soap. 

TO DARKEN THE HAIR. 

Wash the head in spring water, and comb the hair 
in the sun, having dipped the comb in oil of tartar. Do 
this three times a day for a fortnight. 

OIL FOR THE HAIR. 

One half sweet oil and half brandy is very nice for the 
hair, or alcohol and castor oil is also good. The cas- 
tor oil should be boiled before using. Scent with any 
thing you like. 

MACASSAR OIL FOR THE HAIR. 

Take half an ounce of alkanet root, and divide into 
four parts ; tie up each part in a bit of clean thin mus- 
lin ; put them in a large tumbler or earthen vessel, and 
pour on half a pint of the best fresh olive oil ; cover up 
tight, and let it remain a week. Then take out the lit- 
tle bags carefully, and lay them in a saucer. The oil 
will be colored a beautiful crimson. Put into a bottle 
any perfumery you like, such as oil of roses, oil of pink, 
extract of violets. The pungent oils are not good for 
hair, and should not be used for scenting Macassar oil. 
After filling your bottle or vials, tie a bit of white leather 
over the corks. Do not shake it when used, but pour 
a little in a saucer, and with the finger rub into the 
roots of the hair. The bags of alkanet will answer to 
use again. 

MACASSAR OIL — ANOTHER WAY. 

Take quarts of common oil, half a pint of spirits 
of wine, three ounces of cinnamon powder, two ounces 
of bergamot. Heat them together in an earthen ves- 
sel ; then remove from the fire, and add four small pieces 
of alkanet root; keep it closely covered for several 
hours ; then filter and put in vials, with white leather 
tied over the corks.

fresh lard in water two or three days, changing and 
beating it every day ; put it to drain, and when dry, 
put into a jar, and set it in a kettle of water. When 
melted, pour it into a basin, and add two spoonfuls of 
brandy ; beat it well ; then pour off the brandy, and add 
lenion or any scent you like. 

HAKD POMATUM. 

Prepare equal quantities of beef marrow, and mut- 
ton tallow suet, in cold water as above ; then brandy to

the vials, and put paper around. 

POMADE DIVINE. 

Take a pound and a half of beef marrow ; put it into 
a vessel of spring-water, and let it remain ten days, 
changing the water every day, night and morning; 
then steep it in rose-water twenty-four hours ; drain it 
in a cloth till dry ; then take an ounce of storax, gum- 
benjamin, odoriferous cj'press-powder, or of Florence, 
each an ounce, half an ounce of cinnamon, two drachms 
of cloves, two of nutmegs, all finely powdered ; mix 
with the marrow, and put into a pewter pot that holds 
three pints. Make a paste of the white of egg and 
flour ; put on a cloth ; then put over another cloth, to 
make it thick ; fasten on the pot tightly that none of 
the steam may escape ; set it into a brass or copper ket- 
tle with water in, and boil four hours without ceasing. 
Have hot water in another kettle to fill up as fast as it 
boils out. Do not let it come up to the top to wet the 
cloth ; strain it through a linen cloth, and put into small 
pots ; when cold, cover them. Don't touch it with any 
thing but silver.

Make it fresh every two weeks. 

GO"WLAND'S LOTION. 

Take one and a quarter grains of bichloride of mer- 
cury, one ounce of emulsion of bitter almonds ; mix

oil of lavender two drachms, five drops of otto of roses ; 
mix well and cork tight. 

ANOTHER. 

One ounce of English oil of lavender, the same of 
bergamot, one pint of rectified spirits of wine, four

alternately, until a glass jar is filled. The cotton must 
be dipped in Florence or Lucca oil first. Tie a bladder 
over the top to keep tight ; then place the vessel where 
it will have the heat of the sun for two weeks. Then 
open and squeeze out the mass, and a fragrant oil will 
be expressed nearly equal to the high-priced otto ol 
roses. 

A NICE "WASH FOR THE HAIR. 

Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce of camphor » 
powder fine, and dissolve in one quart of boiling water ; 
when cool, wash the head with a piece of sponge, rub- 
bing the roots of the hair well ; afterward wipe with a 
dry towel. It should be done at night before retiring 
to bed. In the morning use oil or pomatum. This 
wash cleanses the hair and stimulates its growth ; the 
oil is required to soften and maintain its gloss. 

TOOTH PO"WDER. 

Charcoal two ounces, Peruvian bark one ounce, pow- 
dered orris root half an ounce, the same of prepared 
chalk, oil of lavender or bergamot twenty drops ; work

CAMPHOR CERATE FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

Take one ounce and a half of spermaceti, half an 
ounce of white wax, six drachms of camphor, and four 
table-spoonfuls of olive oil ; put in an earthen vessel,

AND housekeeper's AID. 2V9 

well when liquid ; rub the hands thoroughly with a lit- 
tle of the cerate, and then wash them as usual. It is 
better to put on at night. Keep it well covered, or it 
will evaporate. For perspiration of the hands, use a 
little wheat bran. 

TO "WHITEN" THE HANDS. 

Take a wine-glass of eau de Cologne, and another of 
lemon-juice ; then scrape two cakes of brown Windsor 
soap, or pure white soap, and mix well in a mould. 
When hard, use for whiting the hands.

of orange-flower water, one drachm of oil of cloves, 
one of English oil of lavender, two drachms of oil of 
bergamot, two grains of musk, one pint of spirits of 
wine ; macerate thoroughly, and add one drachm of es- 
sence of musk. 

PALMA CHKISTI OIL. 

Take one ounce of palma christi oil ; add oil of ber- 
gamot or lavender to scent it ; brush it well into the 
hair twice a day for two or three months. It will make 
the hair luxuriant. 

BANDOLINE FOR THE HAIR. 

Put one oimce of quince seed to a quart of water ; 
let it simmer half an hour ; then strain it, and when 



280 EXCELSIOR cook: book 

cold add any scent you like. Linseed or gum-arabic 
are good done in the same manner. 

ANOTHER. 

Take an ounce and a half of isinglass, two thirds of 
a pint of water ; pour the water over the isinglass, and 
cover it ; let it remain all night. The next day put 
where it will warm till dissolved ; then add two wine- 
glasses of spirits of wine ; scent with any oil you like, 
but mix with the spirits before adding. 

TO MAKE WASH-BALLS. 

Shave two pounds of new white soap in a tea-cupful 
of rose-water ; then pour as much boiling water on as 
will soften it ; put a pint of sweet oil into a brass pan ; 
four ounces of oil of almonds, half a pound of sperma- 
ceti ; set it over the fire till dissolved, then add the 
soap, and half an ounce of camphor reduced to a pow- 
der, by adding a little spirits of wine or lavender- 
water. Boil ten minutes, then pour into a basin, and 
stir till thick enough to make into balls, which must 
be done as quick as possible. If essence is used, stir in 
quick after taking off the fire. 

THE NAILS. 

To give a fine color to the nails they must be washed 
in fine soap ; then rub with equal parts of cinnabar 
and emery, and afterward with oil of bitter almonds. 
Lemon-juice is good to wash them in. They should 
never be scraped. 

COLD CKEAM. 

Take oil of almonds two ounces, white wax and sperm- 
aceti each one drachm ; melt in an earthen vessel, and 
while warm add rose-water two ounces, half an ounce 
of orange flower. 

TO CLEAN HAIR-BKUSHES.

and two drachms of the tincture of cantharides ; per- 
fume with any thing you like ; shake well and apply 
to the hair as occasion requires. 

TO MAKE LEATHER ^WATER-PROOF. 

Take one ounce of the balsam of copaiba, and one 
ounce of beeswax ; melt together and apply warm. It 
improves the leather, and is good for sore or chapped 

hands. 

FOR PIMPLES OW THE FACE. NO. 2. 

Dissolve ten grains of corrosive sublimate, fifteen 
grains of muriate of ammonia, in two ounces of Cologne 
and two of rose-water ; bathe the parts affected. 

INVISIBLE CEMENT. 

Dissolve isinglass in hot alcohol, and it will stick 
firmly broken crockery or glass. 

TO DARKEN THE HAIR. 

Take two ounces of lac sulphur, half an ounce of 
sufrar of lead, half an ounce of sulphate of iron ; per- 
. fume with any thing you like ; moisten the hair at night 
and comb out in the morning. 

POMATUM FOR THE COMPLEXION. 
Take one ounce of oil of sweet almonds, half an 
ounce of white wax and spermaceti each, with a little 
balm ; melt these ingredients slowly over a fire ; then 
pour into a marble mortar, and stir until smooth and 
co1(Ij then add gradually an ounce of rose-water ; stir 



282 EXCELSIOR COOK BOOK 

till it resembles cream. This renders the skin soft and 
smooth. Keep it tied with a bladder. 

LIP SALVE. NO. 2. 

Take half a pound of fresh lard, an ounce and a half 
of white wax ; set it on the fire till melted ; then take
