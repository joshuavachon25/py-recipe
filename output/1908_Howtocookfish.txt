HOW TO COOK FISH 



THE CATCHING OF UNSHELLED 
FISH 

"First catch your hare," the old cookery 
books used to say, and hence it is proper, in a 
treatise devoted entirely to the cooking of 
Unshelled Fish, to pay passing attention to 
the Catching, or what the Head of the House 
terms the Masculine Division of the Subject. 
As it is evident that the catching must, in 
every case precede the cooking — but not too 
far — the preface is the place to begin. 

Shell-fish are, comparatively, slow of move- 
ment, without guile, pitifully trusting, and 
very easily caught. Observe the difference 
between the chunk of mutton and four feet of 
string with which one goes crabbing, and the 
complicated hooks, rods, flies, and reels de- 
voted to the capture of unshelled fish. 

An unshelled fish is lively and elusive past 

the power of words to portray, and in this, 

undoubtedly, lies its desirability. People will 

travel for two nights and a day to some spot 

I 



2 Dow to Cooft fiBb 

where an unshelled fish has once been seen, 
taking $59.99 worth of fishing tackle, "marked 
down from $60.00 for to-day only," rent a 
canoe, hire a guide at more than human life is 
worth in courts of law. and work with dogged 
patience from gray dawn till sunset. And 
for what? For one small bass which could 
have been bought at any trustworthy market 
for sixty-five cents, or, possibly, some poor 
little kitten-fish — offspring of a catfish — 
whose mother's milk is not yet dry upon its 
lips. 

Other fish who have just been weaned and 
are begininng to notice solid food will re- 
peatedly take a hook too large to swallow, 
and be dragged into the boat, literally, by 
the skin of the teeth. Note the cheerful little 
sunfish, four inches long, which is caught 
first on one side of the boat and then on the 
other, by the patient fisherman angling off a 
rocky, weedy point for bass. 

But, as Grover Cleveland said: "He is no 
true fisherman who is willing to fish only when 
fish are biting.'* The real angler will sit all 
day in a boat in a pouring rain, eagerly 
watching the point of the rod, which never 
for an instant swerves a half inch from the 
horizontal. The real angler will troll for 
miles with a hand line and a spinner, winding 
in the thirty-five dripping feet of the lure 



Xlbc Catcbfnd of TKndbellet) yi0b 3 

every ten minutes, to remove a weed, or "to 
see if she 's still a-spinnin'." Vainly he hopes 
for the muskellunge who has just gone some- 
where else, but, by the same token, the sure- 
enough angler is ready to go out next morning, 
rain or shine, at sunrise. 

It is a habit of Unshelled Fish to be in other 
places, or, possibly, at your place, but at 
another time. The guide can never under- 
stand what is wrong. Five days ago, he 
himself caught more bass than he could carry 
home, at that identical rocky point. A man 
from La Porte, Indiana, whom he took out 
the week before, landed a thirty-eight pound 
•* muskie " in trolling through that same nar- 
row channel . In the forty years that the guide 
has lived in the place, man and boy, he has 
never known the fishing to be as poor as it 
is now. Why, even "ol' Pop Somers" has 
ceased to fish ! 

But the real angler continues, regardless of 
the local sage. He who has heard the line 
sing suddenly out of his reel, and, after a hard- 
fought hour, scooped a six-pound black bass 
into the landing net, weary, but still "game," 
is not dismayed by bad luck. He who can 
cast a fiy a hundred feet or more finds pleasure 
in that, if not in fishing. Whoever has taken 
in a muskellunge of any size will ever after 
troll patiently, even through masses of weed.

Whoever has leaned over the side of a sail- 
boat, peering down into the green, crystalline 
waters of the Gulf, and seen, twenty feet 
down, the shimmering sides of a fifteen-pound 
red grouper, firmly hooked and coming, will 
never turn over sleepily, for a last nap, when 
his door is almost broken in at 5 a.m. 

And, fish or no fish, there are compensa- 
tions. Into a day of heart-breaking and soul- 
sickening toil, when all the world goes wrong, 
must sometimes come the vision of a wooded 
shore, with tiny dark wavelets singing softly 
on the rocks and a robin piping cheerily on 
the topmost bough of a maple. Tired eyes 
look past the musty ledger and the letter files 
to a tiny sapphire lake, set in hills, with the 
late afternoon light streaming in glory from 
the far mountains beyond. 

It may be cold up North, but down in the 
Gulf they are fishing — scudding among the 
Florida Keys in a little white sailboat, landing 
for lunch on a strand as snowy as the northern 
streets, where the shimmering distances of 
white sand are paved with shell and pearl, and 
the tide thrums out its old song under the 
palms. And fish? Two-hundred and fifty 
pounds is the average day's catch for a small 
sailboat cruising among the Florida Keys. 

Yet, when all is said and done, the catching 
of fish is a matter of luck — a gambler's chance, 



tLhc Cntcbim of TllnebeUet) yi0b 5 

if you will have it so. The cooking, in un- 
skilled hands, is also a lottery, but, by fol- 
lowing the appended recipes, becomes an art 
to which scientific principles have been faith- 
fully applied. 

Having caught your fish, you may cook him 
in a thousand ways, but it is doubtful whether, 
even with the finest sauce, a pompano will 
taste half as good as the infantile muskellunge, 
several pounds under the legal weight, fried 
unskilfully in pork fat by a homy-handed 
woodsman, kneeling before an open fire, 
eighteen minutes after you had given up all 
hope of having fish for dinner, and had re- 
signed yourself to the dubious prospect of salt 
pork, eggs, and coffee which any self-respecting 
coffee-mill would fail to recognize. 

All of which is respectfully submitted by 

O. G.

and half a teaspoonful of dry mustard. Place 
the bowl on ice or in ice-water. Pour one 
cupful of olive-oil into a small pitcher from 
which it will drop easily. When the egg and 
seasoning are thoroughly mixed, begin to add 
the oil, using a silver teaspoon, and rubbing 
rather than stirring. Add the oil until a clear 
spot is formed upon the egg, and then mix 



30 Dow to Cook fiBb 

until smooth. Only a few drops can be added 
at first, but the quantity may be gradually in- 
creased. The clear spot on the egg is an in- 
fallible test of the right quantity of oil. If

A few drops of lemon- juice and long beating 
will usually make it right again. If this fails, 
set the bowl directly on the ice in the refriger- 
ator, and let stand for half an hour. If it is 
still curdled, begin again with the yolk of 
another egg and add the curdled mayonnaise

lemon, if desired.

Good Living 

A Practical Cookery Book for Town and Country. 
By Sara Van Buren BRUOiiRS. Fifth edition. 
Octavo 91.75 

This book contains over 1300 recipes drawn from 
highest authorities and many countries. All the 
plainer dishes, which every family requires, and 
which are generally slighted because they are plain 
and simple, have received careful study ; roasting, 
bread- and butter-making, etc., having had great at- 
tention. Besides these, there is an endless variety 
of entries or side-dishes to suit the palate of the 
gourmet^ all simple and easy to make, giving a large 
scope for the housekeeper to furnish a varied table 
with a comparatively limited variety of material. 
Another aim, almost if not quite eaual, is economy, 
eveiy recipe given being within the reach of any 
famUy of moderate, even modest means, in either

HOW TO COOK FISH 



THE CATCHING OF UNSHELLED 

FISH 

"First catch your hare," the old cookery 
books used to say, and hence it is proper, in a 
treatise devoted entirely to the cooking of 
Unshelled Fish, to pay passing attention to 
the Catching, or what the Head of the House 
terms the Masculine Division of the Subject. 
As it is evident that the catching must, in 
every case precede the cooking but not too 
far the preface is the place to begin. 

Shell-fish are, comparatively, slow of move- 
ment, without guile, pitifully trusting, and 
very easily caught. Observe the difference 
between the chunk of mutton and four feet of 
string with which one goes crabbing, and the 
complicated hooks, rods, flies, and reels de- 
voted to the capture of unshelled fish. 

An unshelled fish is lively and elusive past 
the power of words to portray, and in this, 
undoubtedly, lies its desirability. People will 
travel for two nights and a day to some spot 

i 



130\V tO COOft 



where an unshelled fish has once been seen. 
taking $59.99 worth of fishing tackle, "marked 
down from $60.00 for to-day only," rent a 
canoe, hire a guide at more than human life is 
worth in courts of law. and work with dogged 
patience from gray dawn till sunset. And 
for what? For one small bass which could 
have been bought at any trustworthy market 
for sixty-five cents, or, possibly, some poor 
little kitten-fish offspring of a catfish- 
whose mother's milk is not yet dry upon its 
lips. 

Other fish who have just been weaned and 
are beginning to notice solid food will re- 
peatedly take a hook too large to swallow, 
and be dragged into the boat, literally, by 
the skin of the teeth. Note the cheerful little 
sunfish, four inches long, which is caught 
first on one side of the boat and then on the 
other, by the patient fisherman angling off a 
rocky, weedy point for bass. 

But, as Grover Cleveland said: "He is no 
true fisherman who is willing to fish only when 
fish are biting." The real angler will sit all 
day in a boat in a pouring rain, eagerly 
watching the point of the rod, which never 
for an instant swerves a half inch from the 
horizontal. The real angler will troll for 
miles with a hand line and a spinner, winding 
in the thirty-five dripping feet of the lure 



Gbe Catcbfng of 7HngbeUc& fteb 3 

every ten minutes, to remove a weed, or "to 
see if she's still a-spinnin'." Vainly he hopes 
for the muskellunge who has just gone some- 
where else, but, by the same token, the sure- 
enough angler is ready to go out next morning, 
rain or shine, at sunrise. 

It is a habit of Unshelled Fish to be in other 
places, or, possibly, at your place, but at 
another time. The guide can never under- 
stand what is wrong. Five days ago, he 
himself caught more bass than he could carry 
home, at that identical rocky point. A man 
from La Porte, Indiana, whom he took out 
the week before, landed a thirty-eight pound 
"muskie" in trolling through that same nar- 
row channel. In the forty years that the guide 
has lived in the place, man and boy, he has 
never known the fishing to be as poor as it 
is now. Why, even "ol* Pop Somers" has 
ceased to fish ! 

But the real angler continues, regardless of 
the local sage. He who has heard the line 
sing suddenly out of his reel, and, after a hard- 
fought hour, scooped a six-pound black bass 
into the landing net, weary, but still "game," 
is not dismayed by bad luck. He who can 
cast a fly a hundred feet or more finds pleasure 
in that, if not in fishing. Whoever has taken 
in a muskellunge of any size will ever after 
troll patiently, even through masses of weed. 



"fcow to Coofc 



Whoever has leaned over the side of a sail- 
boat, peering down into the green, crystalline 
waters of the Gulf, and seen, twenty feet 
down, the shimmering sides of a fifteen-pound 
red grouper, firmly hooked and coming, will 
never turn over sleepily, for a last nap, when 
his door is almost broken in at 5 A.M. 

And, fish or no fish, there are compensa- 
tions. Into a day of heart-breaking and soul- 
sickening toil, when all the world goes wrong, 
must sometimes come the vision of a wooded 
shore, with tiny dark wavelets singing softly 
on the rocks and a robin piping cheerily on 
the topmost bough of a maple. Tired eyes 
look past the musty ledger and the letter files 
to a tiny sapphire lake, set in hills, with the 
late afternoon light streaming in glory from 
the far mountains beyond. 

It may be cold up North, but down in the 
Gulf they are fishing scudding among the 
Florida Keys in a little white sailboat, landing 
for lunch on a strand as snowy as the northern 
streets, where the shimmering distances of 
white sand are paved with shell and pearl, and 
the tide thrums out its old song under the 
palms. And fish? Two-hundred and fifty 
pounds is the average day's catch for a small 
sailboat cruising among the Florida Keys. 

Yet, when all is said and done, the catching 
of fish is a matter of luck a gambler's chance, 



Catcbfng ot TIlnsbelleD tfisb 



if you will have it so. The cooking, in un- 
skilled hands, is also a lottery, but, by fol- 
lowing the appended recipes, becomes an art 
to which scientific principles have been faith- 
fully applied. 

Having caught your fish, you may cook him 
in a thousand ways, but it is doubtful whether, 
even with the finest sauce, a pompano will 
taste half as good as the infantile muskellunge, 
several pounds under the legal weight, fried 
unskilfully in pork fat by a horny-handed 
woodsman, kneeling before an open fire, 
eighteen minutes after you had given up all 
hope of having fish for dinner, and had re- 
signed yourself to the dubious prospect of salt 
pork, eggs, and coffee which any self-respecting 
coffee-mill would fail to recognize. 

All of which is respectfully submitted by 

O. G.

MAYONNAISE 

Put into an earthen bowl the yolk of a fresh 
egg and a pinch of salt, a dash of red pepper, 
and half a teaspoonful of dry mustard. Place 
the bowl on ice or in ice-water. Pour one 
cupful of olive-oil into a small pitcher from 
which it will drop easily. When the egg and 
seasoning are thoroughly mixed, begin to add 
the oil, using a silver teaspoon, and rubbing 
rather than stirring. Add the oil until a clear 
spot is formed upon the egg, and then mix 



30 tbow to Coofe 



until smooth. Only a few drops can be added 
at first, but the quantity may be gradually in- 
creased. The clear spot on the egg is an in- 
fallible test of the right quantity of oil. If 
too much oil is added the dressing will curdle. 
A few drops of lemon-juice and long beating 
will usually make it right again. If this fails, 
set the bowl directly on the ice in the refriger- 
ator, and let stand for half an hour. If it is 
still curdled, begin again with the yolk of 
another egg and add the curdled mayonnaise 
by degrees to the new dressing.

is difficult to stir it, add the juice of half a 
lemon, if desired.

juice, and minced parsley. Add the yolks 
of two eggs, beaten with a little milk, and 
heat thoroughly, but do not boil. Spread 
on very hot buttered toast. 

FISH A LA VINAIGRETTE 

Flake cold cooked fish and arrange on a 
platter with a border of lettuce leaves. Pour 
over it a French dressing to which chopped 
olives, capers, and pickles have been added. 



BACK TALK 

The author, though at present unable to 
contemplate calmly even a pair of fish-net 
curtains, is willing to admit that there are 
more ways of cooking fish than appear here. 
The blank pages appended are for additional 

recipes.

I. What to Have for Breakfast. 

" One might conscientiously use a number of enthusi- 
astic adjectives about Olive Green's Guide to the Cheer- 
ful Life. It is a small book, but any one who looks 
it over can find a hundred reasons for owning it, and, 
failing to publish it, the Board of Home Missions lost an 
opportunity," Life, N. Y. 

" One of the sanest brochures on the food question 
yet published." N. Y. Evening Mail. 

'' Whoever follows its laws will bring peace to her 
household and kindly fame to herself. It is the best 
book in all the world with which to start the fresh day, 
and an intelligent application of its rules may set in 
motion the very springs of heroism, joy, and achieve- 
ment." Chicago Tribune. 

II. Everyday Luncheons. 

" Here are 365 menus, one for every day in the year, 
besides a variety of recipes that have a toothsome aspect 
in print and have not been found wanting in practice, as 
we are assured. There are some imroductory words on 
* Luncheons, Wise and Foolish,' which contain sound 
philosophy with a coating of humor." 

Pittsburg Gazette. 

" Covers the whole subject in a complete and compre- 
hensive fashion." Albany Argus. 

* A helpful companion for any woman seeking to 
vary her menus. The recipes are economical, in many 
cases new, and in all cases practical. 

The Congregationalist. 

"It is well worth the attention of every careful 
housewife." Boston Times.

HI. One Thousand Simple Soups. 

14 Its information is all practical and every recipe con- 
tained within its covers is well worth trying. It will prove 
a valuable addition to the domestic shelf of any housewife 
whether she be her own cook or not." Newark Advertiser. 

"The recipes are well-classed and are distinctly good. 
The neat little volume deserves a prominent place upon the 
kitchen shelf." Chicago Record-Herald.

good things besides the recipes." Burlington Free Press.

What One Can Do with a Chafing- 

Dish 

By H. L. SAWTELLE. New revised and enlarged 
edition, i6mo $1.00 

"Messrs. Putnam have just issued a revised and enlarged 
edition of a charming book entitled ' What One Can Do with 
a Chafing-Dish.' I have written three works on this subject 
myself, and am therefore competent to judge the book in ques- 
tion. Miss Sawtelle's book should be in possession of every 
owner of a chafing-dish in this or any other country. The 
recipes are excellent, and while they are dainty enough to 
suit the most fastidious, they are also plain and practical." 
THOMAS J. MURRAY, in " Twentieth Century Cookery."

Books for tbc TbouscboK) 

Good Living 

A Practical Cookery Book for Town and Country. 
By SARA VAN BUREN BRUGIERE. Fifth edition. 
Octavo ...... $i.75 

This book contains over 1300 recipes drawn from 
highest authorities and many countries. All the 
plainer dishes, which every family requires, and 
which are generally slighted because they are plain 
and simple, have received careful study ; roasting, 
bread- and butter-making, etc., having had great at- 
tention. Besides these, there is an endless variety 
of entries or side-dishes to suit the palate of the 
gourmet^ all simple and easy to make', giving a large 
scope for the housekeeper to furnish a varied table 
with a comparatively limited variety of material. 
Another aim, almost if not quite equal, is economy, 
every recipe given being within the reach of any 
family of moderate, even modest means, in either 
city or country.

lk We recommend it as sensible, practical, and so clear and 
distinct in its directions as to insure good results. The book 
is as tasteful as the compounds are tasty. Its perusal is 
equal to a course in a first-class cooking-school." Woman's 
Journal,

HOW TO COOK FISH 

THE CATCHING OF UNSHELLED 
FISH 

"First catch your hare," the old cookery 
books used to say, and hence it is proper, in a 
treatise devoted entirely to the cooking of 
Unshelled Fish, to pay passing attention to 
the Catching, or what the Head of the House 
terms the ^lasculine Division of the Subject. 
As it is evident that the catching must, in 
every case precede the cooking — but not too 
far — the preface is the place to begin. 

Shell-fish are, comparatively, slow of move- 
ment, without guile, pitifully trusting, and 
very easily caught. Observe the difference 
between the chunk of mutton and four feet of 
string with which one goes crabbing, and the 
complicated hooks, rods, flies, and reels de- 
voted to the capture of unshelled fish. 

An unshelled fish is lively and elusive past 

the power of words to portray, and in this, 

undoubtedly, lies its desirability. People will 

travel for two nights and a day to some spot

where an unshelled fish has once been seen, 
taking $59.99 worth of fishing tackle, "marked 
down from $60.00 for to-day only," rent a 
canoe, hire a guide at more than human life is 
worth in courts of law. and work with dogged 
patience from gray dawn till sunset. And 
for what? For one small bass which could 
have been bought at any trustworthy market 
for sixty-five cents, or, possibly, some poor 
little kitten-fish — offspring of a catfish — 
whose mother's milk is not yet dry upon its 
lips. 

Other fish who have just been weaned and 
are begininng to notice solid food will re- 
peatedly take a hook too large to swallow, 
and be dragged into the boat, literally, by 
the skin of the teeth. Note the cheerful little 
sunfish, four inches long, which is caught 
first on one side of the boat and then on the 
other, by the patient fisherman angling off a 
rocky, weedy point for bass. 

But, as Grover Cleveland said: "He is no 
true fisherman who is willing to fish only when 
fish are biting." The real angler will sit all 
day in a boat in a pouring rain, eagerly 
watching the point of the rod, which never 
for an instant swerves a half inch from the 
horizontal. The real angler will troll for 
miles with a hand line and a spinner, winding 
in the thirty-five dripping feet of the lure

every ten minutes, to remove a weed, or "to 
see if she 's still a-spinnin'." Vainly he hopes 
for the muskellunge who has just gone some- 
where else, but, by the same token, the sure- 
enough angler is ready to go out next morning, 
rain or shine, at sunrise. 

It is a habit of Unshelled Fish to be in other 
places, or, possibly, at your place, but at 
another time. The guide can never under- 
stand what is wrong. Five days ago, he 
himself caught more bass than he could carry 
home, at that identical rocky point. A man 
from La Porte, Indiana, whom he took out 
the week before, landed a thirty-eight pound 
"muskie" in trolling through that same nar- 
row channel. In the forty years that the guide 
has lived in the place, man and boy, he has 
never known the fishing to be as poor as it 
is now. Why, even "ol' Pop Somers " has 
ceased to fish ! 

But the real angler continues, regardless of 
the local sage. He who has heard the line 
sing suddenly out of his reel, and, after a hard- 
fought hour, scooped a six-pound black bass 
into the landing net, weary, but still "game," 
is not dismayed by bad luck. He who can 
cast a fly a hundred feet or more finds pleasure 
in that, if not in fishing. Whoever has taken 
in a muskellunge of any size will ever after 
troll patiently, even through masses of weed.

Whoever has leaned over the side of a sail- 
boat, peering down into the green, crystalline 
waters of the Gulf, and seen, twenty feet 
down, the shimmering sides of a fifteen-pound 
red grouper, firmly hooked and coming, will 
never turn over sleepily, for a last nap, when 
his door is almost broken in at 5 a.m. 

And, fish or no fish, there are compensa- 
tions. Into a day of heart-breaking and soul- 
sickening toil, when all the world goes wrong, 
must sometimes come the vision of a wooded 
shore, with tiny dark wavelets singing softly 
on the rocks and a robin piping cheerily on 
the topmost bough of a maple. Tired eyes 
look past the musty ledger and the letter files 
to a tiny sapphire lake, set in hills, with the 
late afternoon light streaming in glory from 
the far mountains beyond. 

It may be cold up North, but down in the 
Gulf they are fishing — scudding among the 
Florida Keys in a little white sailboat, landing 
for lunch on a strand as snowy as the northern 
streets, where the shimmering distances of 
white sand are paved with shell and pearl, and 
the tide thrums out its old song under the 
palms. And fish? Two-hundred and fifty 
pounds is the average day's catch for a small 
sailboat cruising among the Florida Keys. 

Yet, when all is said and done, the catching 
of fish is a matter of luck — a gambler's chance, 



^be Catcbtng ot TIlngbeHeD ifisb 5 

if you will have it so. The cooking, in un- 
skilled hands, is also a lottery, but, by fol- 
lowing the appended recipes, becomes an art 
to which scientific principles have been faith- 
fully applied. 

Having caught your fish, you may cook him 
in a thousand ways, but it is doubtful whether, 
even with the finest sauce, a pompano will 
taste half as good as the infantile muskellunge, 
several pounds under the legal weight, fried 
unskilfully in pork fat by a horny-handed 
woodsman, kneeling before an open fire, 
eighteen minutes after you had given up all 
hope of having fish for dinner, and had re- 
signed yourself to the dubious prospect of salt 
pork, eggs, and coffee which any self-respecting 
coffee-mill would fail to recognize. 

All of which is respectfully submitted by 

O. G.

MAYONNAISE 

Put into an earthen bowl the yolk of a fresh 
egg and a pinch of salt, a dash of red pepper, 
and half a teaspoonful of dry mustard. Place 
the bowl on ice or in ice-water. Pour one 
cupful of olive-oil into a small pitcher from 
which it will drop easily. When the egg and 
seasoning are thoroughly mixed, begin to add 
the oil, using a silver teaspoon, and rubbing 
rather than stirring. Add the oil until a clear 
spot is formed upon the egg, and then mix 



30 ibow to Cook 3Fi0b 

until smooth. Only a few drops can be added 
at first, but the quantity may be gradually in- 
creased. The clear spot on the egg is an in- 
fallible test of the right quantity of oil. If 
too much oil is added the dressing will curdle. 
A few drops of lemon-juice and long beating 
will usually make it right again. If this fails, 
set the bowl directly on the ice in the refriger- 
ator, and let stand for half an hour. If it is 
still curdled, begin again with the yolk of 
another egg and add the curdled mayonnaise 
by degrees to the new dressing. 

When the mayonnaise is so thick that it 
is difficult to stir it, add the juice of half a 
lemon, if desired.

Each, i6mo, cloth, net, Sr.oo 

I. What to Have fof Breakfast. 

" One might conscientiously use a number of enthusi- 
astic adjectives about Olive Green's Guide to the Cheer- 
ful Life. It is a small book, but any one who looks 
it over can find a hundred reasons for owning it, and, 
failing to publish it, the Board of Home Missions lost an 
opportunity," — Life, N. Y. 

^ One of the sanest brochures on the food question 
yet published." — N. Y. Evening Mail. 

" Whoever follows its laws will bring: peace to her 
household and kindly fame to herself. It is the best 
book in all the world with which to start the fresh day, 
and an intelligent application of its rules may set in 
motion the very springs of heroism, joy, and achieve- 
ment." — Chicago Tribune. 

II. Everyday Luncheons. 

" Here are 365 menus, one for every day in the year, 
besides a variety of recipes that have a toothsome aspect 
in print and have not been found wanting in practice, as 
we are assured. There are some introductory words on 
* Luncheons, Wise and Foolish,' which contain sound 
philosophy with a coating of humor." 

Pittsburg Gazette. 

" Covers the whole subject in a complete and compre- 
hensive fashion." — Albany Argus. 

' A helpful companion for any woman seeking to 
vary her menus. The recipes are economical, in many 
cases new, and in all cases practical. 

The Congregationalist. 

"It is well worth the attention of every careful 
housewife." — Boston Times.

III. One Thousand Simple Soups. 

" Its information is all practical and every recipe con- 
tained within its covers is well worth trying. It will prove 
a valuable addition to the domestic shelf of any housewife 
whether she be her own cook or not." — iXeivark Advertiser. 

"The recipes are well-classed and are distinctly good. 
The neat little volume deserves a prominent place upon the 
kitchen shelf." — Chicago Record-Herald. 

IV. How to Cook ShelUFish. 

" The book is very cleverly written and contains many 
good things besides the recipes." — Burlington Free Press. 

" A practical and useful book." — Providence Joxirnal.

" A capital little volume."— iV. Y. Press, 

"Up-to-date and reliable — a book all housewives will 
grasp greedily."— Z'^/'r^zV News.
