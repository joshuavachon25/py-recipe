FOREWORD 

In this volume we do not intend to advance dog- 
matic, one-sided assertions concerning the many-sided 
and difficult problems of hygiene and nutrition, but we 
shall turn on these, from various angles, the light of 
rational inquiry so that the reader may be able to draw 
his own conclusions and to test them in practical 
experience.

NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 



KEY TO OUR SYSTEM OF RECIPE MARKING 

Another cook book? Yes, but a cook book different 
from all others. It not only provides a number of 
wholesome and palatable recipes, but it may be used 
as a guide by phj^sicians and patients, by students of 
the science of dietetics, by all those who wish to apply 
intelligent instead of haphazard methods in the selec- 
tion, combination and preparation of their food. 

This cook book is based on the system of dietetics 
originated by the German School of Nature Cure. 
Drs. Lahmann, Hensel and others found a solution 
of the problem of scientific food selection and com- 
bination which stands every test of theoretical inquiry 
and of practical application. 

Many vegetarian cook books are now on the market, 
but it seems that none of them fully satisfy the de- 
mands of the public, and there are good reasons for 
this. Some of these books contain hardly anything 
but recipes composed of starches, fats, sugars and pro- 
teins. Recipes for the preparation of fruits and vege- 
tables, which represent the mineral group in our sys- 
tem of dietetics, are conspicuous only by their absence. 
Others contain only raw food dishes. Still others give 
misleading advice and make erroneous statements. One 
of the best vegetarian cook books, for instance, advises 
that all leafy vegetables "be thoroughly cooked and 
pressed out" in order to remove the harsh flavors.

2 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

Such treatment, of course, leeches the organic salts 
and thus removes the most valuable elements of nutri- 
tion in the vegetable. 

No matter, however, how good and true the theo- 
retical directions, nor how carefully prepared the 
recipes, most persons find it difficult to apply the prin- 
ciples of natural dietetics in the kitchen. While they 
may fully understand the theory of food selection and 
combination, they do not know the chemical composi- 
tion of the different food materials, and therefore find 
it impossible to select and combine to the best advan- 
tage. 

The same is true of physicians, and students of 
dietetics. Though they may understand thoroughly how 
starches, fats, proteins and organic salts should be 
combined, in order to meet the requirements of the 
body for the various elements of nutrition, they often 
have not sufficient knowledge of food analysis to pre- 
scribe or carry out a system of rational food combina- 
tion, such as taught, for instance, in "Natural Diet- 
etics." They would be at a loss to know in what pro 
portions starches, proteins, organic salts, etc., are 
contained in wheat, beans, nuts, bananas, apples, or 
other food material, unless they had made a special 
study of food chemistry. 

Furthermore, the physician who possesses this knowl- 
edge cannot impart it to the nurse or cook who has to 
provide the food for the patient. 

This difficulty is increased in cases of sickness and 
invalidism, when special care in the proper selection 
and combination of food becomes a necessity, and Avhen 
errors in diet are far-reaching in their harmful conse- 
quences. 

In order to overcome these difficulties and perplex- 



KEY TO RECIPE MARKING 3 

ities of the physician, the nurse, the cook and the 
patient, in an easy and thoroughly practical way, we 
have hit upon the following plan: 

We have divided all food materials into the follow- 
ing five groups: (See diagrams on pages 385a, 385b.) 

Group I (St.) Starches. 

Group II (S.) Sugars, Dextrines. 

Group III (F.) Fats, Oils. 

Group IV (P.) Proteids: Albumin, Gluten, Myo- 
sin, Hemoglobin, etc. 

Group V (M.) Positive Mineral Elements: Potas- 
sium, Sodium, Iron, Lime, Magnesium, Manganese, 
Lithium, etc. 

Every recipe in this cook book, underneath its title, 
will be marked in such a way as to show the various 
food elements which it contains, in the order of their 
amounts and importance. In order to make easier 
reading and to avoid confusion, we shall use in these 
markings the initial letters of the food elements, in- 
stead of the numbers of the groups, viz. : 

St. — for starches (Gr. I). 

S. — for sugar (Gr. II). 

F.— for fats (Gr. III). 

P.— for proteids (Gr. IV). 

M. — for positive mineral elements (Gr. V). 

For instance, if starches outweigh the other food 
elements in a recipe, St. will be placed first and the 
other elements after, in the order of their importance 
in the recipe. If the organic, mineral salts constitute 
the predominating food elements Group M. will have 
first place. The food elements which are present in a 
recipe in considerable quantities will appear in black 



4 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

face type. Those which are present in negligible quan- 
tities will appear at the end of the line, separated by 
a dash ( — ), in pale, ordinary type. For instance, 
St. S. P.— F. M. 

In the following we give a few practical illustra- 
tions : 

Combination Salad 

Groups M. F. 

Ingredients: Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, Spanish 
onions, lemon juice, olive oil. 

Wash lettuce, reuioving defective leaves. Slice 
cucumbers, tomatoes and Spanish onions rather thin, 
arrange on the lettuce; serve with a dressing made of 
two parts olive oil to one part lemon juice. 

Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and onions contain 
large quantities of the five positive mineral elements. 
Mineral elements are also predominant in the lemon 
juice of the dressing. The olive oil, on the other hand, 
contains nothing but different kinds of fats. Accord- 
ingly this recipe is marked Groups M. F. (Group M., 
mineral elements; Group F., fats and oils). Both 
groups are present in considerable quantities, there- 
fore both appear in black face type. 

Our Health Bread 

Groups St. P.— M. F. S. 

This bread contains about forty per cent starches, 
ten per cent protein (gluten), five per cent cereal fats 
and vegetable oil, three per cent sugar, which has 
formed in the fermentation of the dough, and ten parts 
per thousand of positive mineral salts. Starch and pro- 
tein, occurring in the largest amounts, are placed first 
in the marking and appear in black face type. Fats, 



KEY TO RECIPE MARKING 6 

sugar and mineral elements being present in small 
amounts only, appear in the order named after the 
dash, in ordinary type. 

Milk 
Groups M. S. F. P. 

In explanation of this formula we will give the con- 
tents of milk in round figures (see diagrams on pages 
430, 431 ) . There is no starch in the milk. The starches 
of the ingested food materials through the processes of 
digestion have been changed into dextrine and sugar. 

Group II. Carbohydrates: (Sugars) milk-sugar, 6 
per cent. 

Group III. Hydrocarbons : Fats, 4 per cent. 

Group IV. Proteins: Casein, 31/^ per cent. 

Group V. Positive Mineral Elements: Potassium, 
Iron, Sodiiun, Lime, Magnesium, altogether 23 parts 
per thousand. The Mineral Group is placed first in the 
marking because milk is a positive food, that is, the 
milk is rich in the positive mineral elements in com- 
parison to the negative food elements of the first four 
groups. 

In studying these percentages one must not become 
confused by the fact that the mineral elements are 
present only in minute quantities, in parts per thou- 
sand, while the other food elements occur in much 
larger quantities in parts per hundred. The positive 
mineral elements, though occurring in foods and in 
animal and human bodies in small quantities only, are 
nevertheless of immense importance in the vital 
economy of the body. They are therefore given first 
rank in the markings of the recipes whenever they 
occur in similar or in higher proportions to those in 



6 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

milk. Milk aside from red (arterial) blood of animals 
is the only normal or standard food combination, and 
therefore our yardstick in measuring and estimating 
the chemical composition of other food combinations. 

What Constitutes a Natural Diet? 

Doctors and laymen who are not acquainted with 
the principles of natural dietetics ridicule the idea that 
it is possible to prescribe a diet "which will fit every- 
body," A careful study, however, of the explanatory 
articles in this volume will show that there must be 
a combination of food elements which in certain well- 
defined proportions will fit the demands of the normal, 
human body. This combination must conform in its 
component elements to the chemical composition of 
milk or red (arterial) blood. In other words, any meal 
or diet, temporary or continuous, in order to be "nor- 
mal" or "natural," must conform in its chemical com- 
position to that of milk or arterial blood. If we 
express this food combination in percentages of our 
food groups the formula would read as follows: 

A natural diet, which is to fill the demands of the 
human organism, must consist one-half of the food 
materials of Group V (Mineral Elements) and one- 
half of the food elements of Groups I, II, III, TV 
(Starches, Sugars, Fats and Proteins). 

Any meal or diet composed in the foregoing propor- 
tions conforms to what we designate as normal or 
natural in food combinations. 

Diet Prescriptions Made Easy for the Doctor 

It will be seen that, no matter to what school of 
medicine a physician belongs or what may be his ideas 



KEY TO RECIPE MARKING 7 

on the diet to be used in different diseases, the system 
embodied in this cook book will enable him to give 
his diet prescription in a few words, with absolute pre- 
cision, covering every possibility of food selection and 
combination. 

Foi-merly, in a case of — say — Bright 's disease, the 
doctor could give only very general directions. He 
would, perhaps, say to the patient: "Exclude from 
your diet all foods that are rich in protein, such as 
meat, eggs, gluten, etc." 

But the patient or the nurse might not always know 
what foods are rich in protein, or whether a particular 
recipe contained protein in objectionable quantities. 
Furthermore, they might not know what to substitute 
for the foods containing protein so as to provide the 
patient with a variety of nourishing and appetizing 
dishes. 

Under the plan proposed in this book, the physician, 
if he prefer a low protein diet, rich in organic mineral 
salts, will write his diet prescriptions as follows : 

!l^. Groups: M. — one-half. 

St. and S. — one-fourth. 
F. — one-fourth. 

If, on the other hand, the physician should, in a case 
of diabetes, wish to reduce the carbohydrate foods and 
increase those rich in protein, his prescriptions would 
read as follows: 

^. Groups: P. — one-half. 

F. — one-fourth. 
M. — one-fourth. 
Avoid St. and S. 

As before stated, it is not possible to carry out these 



8 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

directions to the letter, that is, to exclude any of the 
five groups entirely. While most food materials pre- 
dominate in the elements of one or two groups, they 
generally contain small amounts of the elements of the 
other groups in various combinations. The latter 
appear in the markings in pale face type. 

For instance, the substance of wheat consists almost 
entirely of starches and proteins, but it also contains 
fats and organic mineral salts in comparatively small 
quantities (starches, 65 per cent; proteids, 10 per cent; 
fats, 2 per cent; organic salts, 8 to 10 parts per thou- 
sand). 

The patient, or whoever is to carry out the doctor's 
directions in the kitchen, will always find it an easy 
matter to do this intelligently and consistently with 
the help of this cook book. All that needs to be done 
is to compare the diet prescription with the group 
markings of the different recipes and to select those 
that conform most closely to the doctor's prescription. 

It will be seen that this system of marking all recipes 
(of which there are over 900 in this cook book) allows 
the widest possible range of choice in the selection, 
combination and mode of preparation of foods. If 
there be restrictions in the use of certain food elements 
in certain diseases as, for instance, the exclusion of 
starchy food in intestinal indigestion, the group mark- 
ings will indicate plainly and at a glance all those 
recipes which should be excluded and those which 
may safely be used. 

We have purposely allowed considerable latitude 
in the use of the dairy products, eggs, spices and con- 
diments in the different recipes for the sake of those 
who may be in the stages of transition from a meat 
diet to the natural regime, and also for the sake of 



KEY TO RECIPE MARKING 9 

those who do not care to apply the principles of vege- 
tarianism to the fullest extent. Those who desire to 
carry out the vegetarian or raw food idea more strictly 
and consistently may modify or exclude the use of 
dairy products, spices and condiments in the recipes 
to suit themselves. 

A Timely Warning 

This may be the place for a timely warning. Do not 
become finical or hypochondriacal over this matter of 
food selection and combination. The man who eats 
with a scale by his side, weighing every bite of food 
he takes, is to be pitied. His over-anxiety prevents the 
natural enjoyment of food, and tends to produce men- 
tal and nervous dyspepsia. 

It is not possible to conform exactly, by weight and 
measure, to the prescriptions and group markings 
given in this book, nor is it necessary in order to secure 
good results. What we are trying to supply (and 
what has been lacking heretofore) is a rational system 
of food classification which can be understood and 
applied by anybody possessed of ordinary intelligence 
in order to procure for himself or for those entrusted 
to his care the diet that is most suitable for the indi- 
vidual conditions and requirements. 

If those who follow the general directions for food 
selection and combination given in this book will keep 
fairly close to the proportions indicated in the group 
markings of the recipes, they will always be within 
safe limits and need not worry about the fitness of 
their diet. 

In cases of serious illness and digestive troubles, it 
is always best to consult a competent physician about

membered thai even the most v/holesome foods, in the 
best possible combination, cannot be properly digested 
and assimilated if the digestive organs are in a slug- 
gish, atrophic condition. In such cases these organs 
must be made more alive and active through natural 
methods of treatment. 



UNCOOKED FOOD VS. COOKED FOOD 

Though this is a "cook book," we find it necessary 
to begin its pages with a recommendation of uncooked 
food. Much can and should be said in favor of raw 
or unfired food, versus cooked food. Less boiling, 
roasting and fermenting and more of raw food would 
undoubtedly do away with a great deal of weakness 
and disease. 

Nature did not create man with a cookstove by his 
side. Man existed on this planet for ages before he 
knew how to start a fire, and in those days of unfired 
food he was, undoubtedly, like all the rest of God's 
creatures who live in the freedom of Nature, healthier 
and stronger physically than the present-day diseased 
and degenerate product of artificial living and hyper- 
civilization. 

This does not mean that we advocate a return to 
savagery and barbarism. But we do claim that we 
can combine with the highest attainments of modern 
civilization, the simple and rational ways of living 
and of treating human ailments which will insure 
health of body and mind, the highest efficiency, and the 
greatest possible capacity for the enjoyment of life. 

The constant use of cooked, highly spiced and 
fermented food takes away the relish of natural un- 
cooked food. It deprives man of the natural instinct 
and intuition for the right selection and combination 
of foods. The majority of people reared in this coun- 
try from infancy up, on the most unwholesome and 

11 



12 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

haphazard food combinations, have lost the capacity 
for sensing and enjoying the delicate flavors of fruits, 
nuts and vegetables. Mankind for ages has lived 
almost entirely on cooked and highly seasoned foods 
and stimulants. This has atrophied the taste buds 
in the tongue and palate. Their natural sensitiveness 
for the finest flavors of fruits, nuts, vegetables and 
other uncooked foods can be restored only by using 
the latter much more liberally in the daily dietary. 

Foods taken in the natural uncooked state have a 
wonderfully vitalizing and stimulating effect upon 
the weakened and partially atrophied digestive organs. 
Many of our extreme cases of chronic indigestion do 
best on a raw food diet. The followers of Nature 
Cure have always emphasized the superiority of raw 
food over cooked food. Now comes advanced science, 
as in so many other instances, and brings the scien- 
tific proofs for that which the Nature Cure people have 
taught and practiced for many years. 

Prominent chemists have discovered that foods con- 
tain in various chemical forms, and in exceedingly 
small proportions, certain substances which they have 
called "vitamines." The word translated into English 
means "living substance." It is assumed that these 
vitamines are molecules highly charged with" vital 
energy, the essential element in nutrition. (See Part II, 
Chapters III and IV.) 

It will be seen that these "new discoveries" are 
nothing else but the re-statement of what we have 
taught these many years, namely, that foods possess 
nourishing value, only by virtue of the life elements 
and the sun energy locked up in their molecules. In 
this connection the following article from the Brit- 
tanica Year Book for 1913 will be of great interest.

Cause and Cure of Beri-Beri 

"Few events in patliology, during late years," says 
Dr. Paget, ''have been more notable, or more happy, 
than the discovery of the cause of this endemic dis- 
ease. Beri-beri, a form of peripheral neuritis, with 
loss of nmseular power, emaciation, and exhaustion, 
has been one of the scourges of the tropics. In the 
Federated Malay States the estimate has been made 
of 45,000 deaths from beri-beri in the course of 30 
years. In the Philippines it has been a long-standing 
evil. During the Russo-Japanese "War, it accounted 
for a very large part of the sickness among the Japa- 
nese. 

• "In 1909 Fraser and Stanton published their 
Etiology of Beri-beri. Working en the lines sug- 
gested by C. Hose and Braddon, they traced the causfe 
of the disease to the use of 'milled' rice, i. e., rice 
which has been 'polished' by the removal of its husk 
and outer layers. Fowls or pigeons fed on polished 
rice alone quickly showed signs of the disease; but 
if the polishings of rice were added to their food they 
quickly recovered. Further observations, by De Haan, 
Chamberlain, Eijkmann, and others, showed that the 
disease was not due simply to the absence of phos- 
phates from the rice. It was due to the loss of a sub- 
stance which is present as a mere trace in the husks; 
indeed, there are no more than ten grains of it in a 
ton of rice. Funk, working at the Lister Institute, 
has lately isolated this substance, and has given it 
the name of 'vitamine.' We are told that a pigeon 
fed on polished rice alone will, in three or four weeks, 
show signs of the disease. If, when death seems immi- 



14 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

neiit, a minute dose of vitamine be given, the bird 
quickly recovers. 

"The wonder does not end here. For this work 
on beri-beri throws light on epidemic dropsy, scurvy, 
rickets, etc. Indeed, Funk has isolated from limes 
a substance similar to vitamine, and present in about 
one in 100,000 parts of the fruit. This 'vitamine of 
the lime' has a favorable action alike on beri-beri and 
on scurvy." 

Dr. Paget asserts that the practical value of these 
studies is already evident. In the Philippines, since 
the American occupation, the change of food from pol- 
ished to unpolished rice has practically stamped out 
the disease beri-beri. Similar results are reported by 
Dr. Heiser in regard to a leper colony at Culion. 
' ' The disease had been so common in this colony, since 
its founding in 1906, that it caused one-third of the 
deaths. But after the use of unpolished rice was made 
compulsory no deaths occurred from the disease, and 
persons already affected were quickly cured by the 
addition of rice-polishings to their food." 

The discoverers of "vitamines" have found that boil- 
ing destroys a great many of these highly organ- 
ized substances, and that temperatures higher than the 
boiling point kill most of them. It has been proved 
that animals will die of starvation when fed exclu- 
sively on foods in which the vitamines have been 
destroyed, through exposure to very high tempera- 
tures, and through chemical action. It is claimed 
that scurvy, rickets and beri-beri are among diseases 
attributable to lack of vitamines in food. 

Vitamines, the carriers of the life elements, are 
located largely in the outermost dark coverings of the 
rice kernel. In the various grains, also, the vitamines 



UNCOOKED FOOD VS. COOKED FOOD 15 

are present in much greater proportion in the outer 
dark layers and in the hull than in the interior sub- 
stance. 

These discoveries of chemical and medical science 
seem to indicate that the positive ** organic mineral 
salts," located in the outer parts and hulls of rice and 
grains, are the carriers of *'vitamines." Thus, step 
by step, now here, now there, orthodox science confirms 
the teachings of Nature Cure, which the leaders of 
this movement discovered by common sense reasoning 
and practical experience. 

All the dairy products, including eggs and honey, 
are very rich in vitamines, or, as we express it, in 
the vito-chemical life elements and in animal mag- 
netism. They are to be preferred to the flesh foods, 
because they can be relished raw, while the boiling 
and roasting of the meat destroys and dissipates a 
large portion of its vitamines. This is especially 
true of meat soups. 

While the statements in the previous paragraphs 
are powerful arguments in favor of raw food, on the 
other hand, the claims of the raw food enthusiasts, 
that all the life elements in the food are dissipated and 
destroyed through cooking and that all the organic 
mineral elements become inorganic through cooking, 
are untrue. Cooking is only a mechanical process of 
sub-division, not a chemical process of transformation. 
The "organic" life molecules of vegetable and animal 
matter cannot be broken down entirely by mechanical 
processes ; this requires chemical action. For instance, 
no matter how long we boil sugar, in a watery solution, 
the sugar will still be sugar. Contact with yeast fer- 
ment, however, will change the sugar into alcohol and 
carbonic acid. The boiling is a purely mechanical 



16 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

process, while the fermentation involves a chemical 
transformation of the fermenting substance. 

If the claims of the raw food people were true, 
humanity M'ould long ago have become extinct as a 
result of living on cooked food. 

We cannot, therefore, agree with the extremists who 
exclude from their diet all cooked foods, and some- 
times even the dairy products. A mixed cooked and 
raw food diet, with liberal allowances of the dairy 
products, seems to agree best with the majority of 
our friends. 

An extreme raw food diet has a tendency to create 
hyper-sentitive conditions physically, mentally and 
psychically. It also limits considerably food selec- 
tion and combination, thereby tending to monotony. 
This is especially true in places where a variety of 
palatable raw foods cannot be obtained all the year 
around. 

There is, however, another drawback to too much 
cooked food in the dietary. A study of the chemical 
composition of the cooked dishes in this book will shoAV 
that many of them though prepared from the fruits 
and vegetables belonging to the mineral group (V), 
are combined with food materials of the other groups 
in such a way that the latter predominate over the 
former. This would make it a difficult matter to 
comply with the teachings of natural dietetics, when 
living on cooked foods alone. The starches, sugars, 
fats and proteins would predominate over the foods 
of the mineral group. 

The only way, therefore, to comply with our general 
formula for a natural diet, consisting one-half of the 
organic mineral group (V), and one-half of the other 
four groups combined, is to have in any one meal only 



UNCOOKED FOOD VS. COOKED POOD 17 

from one to three cooked dishes, and in combination 
with these a liberal amount of raw relishes, salads and 
other uncooked foods, belonging to group five. 

We recommend, and serve in our Sanitarium 
regimen, one meal daily consisting of raw foods only. 

All the juicy fruits and vegetables that can be rel- 
ished and digested in the natural state are not only 
excellent foods, but the best medicines for the human 
body. 

In the following chapter we shall call attention to 
and describe the medicinal properties of the foods best 
suited for eating in the natural state, without cooking, 
spicing, or fermenting. 



RAW FOODS AND THEIR MEDICINAL 
PROPERTIES 

Fruits 

The most delicious and wholesome raw foods are the 
juicy fruits. While they run low in starches, fats 
and proteids, they contain large amounts of the posi- 
tive organic mineral salts (vitamines). 

They are, therefore. Nature's own medicines, — splen- 
did tonics, natural stimulants, cholagogues, purifiers, 
antiseptics, anthelmintics and febrifuges. The only 
medicines we ever prescribe in inflammatory, febrile 
diseases, aside from homeopathic remedies, are acid 
fruit juices, diluted in water. 

The finest medicinal fruits are the acid and sub- 
acid varieties, such as lemons, oranges, limes, grape- 
fruit, pineapples, tangerines, apricots, apples, green 
gages, plums, and certain sub-acid varieties of cherries, 
pears, peaches, nectarines, etc. While these fruits 
contain highly organized acids, such as malic, oxalic 
and citric acid, they are very rich in the positive, alka- 
line mineral elements, and have, therefore, an acid- 
binding and acid-eliminating effect upon the system. 

The prevalent idea, encouraged by many physicians, 
that acid fruits and vegetables cause rheumatism and 
other acid diseases, is entirely without foundation. 
This mistaken idea has arisen from the fact that all 
juicy fruits and vegetables are rich in alkaline or- 
ganic salts, which dissolve the acid deposits in the 
tissues and throw them into the circulation. This 

18 



MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OP RAW POODS 19 

temporarily overloads the blood stream with acids in 
solution, irritating the tender membranes of joints, 
muscles, brain and nerve tissues, and thus creating 
the various symptoms of collaemia or acute uric-acid 
poisoning. As a result the urine shows an increase in 
acids, xanthins, indican, and other forms of systemic 
poisons, which without these explanations are re- 
garded as "deleterious effects of vegetarian and raw- 
food diet." 

This increased elimination is unavoidable, if the 
patient is ever to be cured of his chronic rheumatism 
and other acid diseases — yet fruits and vegetables are 
blamed for causing rheumatism. 

LeiQon Juice the Most Efficient Antiseptic 

The fruit acids, instead of being injurious to the sys- 
tem, are powerful solvents for morbid accumulations 
of an alkaline nature. 

In the treatment of wounds and bedsores, even of a 
most serious nature, we never use anything but lemon 
juJce diluted in water : the juice of one-half lemon in 
a cup of boiled or filtered water. 

Lemon juice is the finest natural antiseptic in exist- 
ence, and at the same time wholesome food, while most 
of the medicinal antiseptics and germicides are power- 
ful protoplasmic poisons, which benumb and kill, not 
only disease germs, bacteria and parasites, but also 
the healthy cells and tissues of the body. If lemon 
juice is such an efficient antiseptic externally, it must 
have similar effects internally. This is true, not only 
of lemon juice, but also in a modified degree of all 
other acid and sub-acid fruits and vegetables. 

Our treatment of wounds is, in other respects, alto- 



20 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

gether contrary to the teachings of the orthodox medi- 
cal schools. While they burj' wounds under many 
layers of bandages, soaked in poisonous antiseptics, 
we expose them as much as possible to air and light. 
The results are simply marvelous. Many wounds and 
sores, which had entered upon the advanced stages of 
necrosis, under the orthodox antiseptic treatment, and 
old varicose ulcers of many years' standing, we have 
healed perfectly with the simple lemon juice, and air 
and light treatment. If somebody tells you this is all 
contrary'' to the teachings of advanced medical science, 
just try for yourself and profit by your personal expe- 
rience, which is, after all, the only proof worth con- 
sidering. 

Fruit Juices the Best Medicines for Babies 

All Nature Cure babies, from the second week of 
their mundane existence, are given acid fruit juices in 
between the milk feedings. This is the best cure for 
rachitic diseases, because in the fruit juices the infant 
receives an abundant supply of the bone and tissue 
building materials. To give lime water, iron, sodium 
and other minerals in the inorganic mineral form, when 
the luscious fruits contain all these elements in the live, 
organic, ''vitamine" combinations, is, to say the least, 
very short sighted. The acid fruits also contain con- 
siderable amounts of fruit sugars, — the finest forms of 
organic sugar in nature. 

Sweet Fruits 

The sweet, alkaline fruits, such as figs, dates, grapes, 
persimmons, melons, cantaloupes, and certain varieties 
of peaches, pears, etc., are very rich in highly refined. 



MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF RAW FOODS 21 

organic sugars, all ready for assimilatiou, and contain 
considerable amounts of the positive, organic mineral 
salts. They are, therefore, nourishing, purifying and 
stimulating. 

Dates rank highest in sugar, but are comparatively 
poor in organic salts. Figs make a much better show- 
ing, while they contain in round figures sixty per cent 
of saccharine elements, they are also very rich in 
the positive organic salts, containing over ten parts 
per thousand of sodium, seven per thousand of lime, 
four per thousand of magnesium. This explains their 
excellent relaxing, laxative properties. Sweet grapes 
rank low in proteids, but high in sugar. They contain 
about one per cent nitrogenous elements, no fats, about 
sixteen per cent of sugar, and rank fairly high in 
organic salts, — about twenty parts per thousand. 

The value of the grape cure, like that of the milk 
cure, lies largely in the fact that it is a mild and pleas- 
ant form of proteid and starch starvation. The grape 
sugars bum up (oxidize), and the alkaline mineral 
elements neutralize and eliminate the acid by-products 
of starch and proteid digestion. 

The Berries 

The berries are still richer in the positive, alkaline 
mineral elements than the acid and sub-acid fruits. 
Therefore, they possess great medicinal values. The 
country people in Germany gather in their seasons, 
the different kinds of berries, and preserve and dry 
them for use in the winter. 

Huckleberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, 
strawberries, gooseberries, elderberries, currants and 
cranberries, besides being delicious raw foods, make 



22 NATUBE CURE COOK BOOK 

excellent soups, drinks, and desserts, and are to be 
classed among Nature's finest remedies. They run 
from 40 to 100 parts per thousand in the positive, alka- 
line mineral elements. 

The wide-spread belief that the seeds of berries and 
fruits are responsible for many cases of appendicitis, is 
another fairy tale. The best way to prevent appendi- 
citis is to live largely on seed-containing fruits and 
berries, and on other kinds of raw food. The small 
seeds which are swallowed readily act as scourers of 
the intestinal tract. They stimulate the peristaltic 
movements of the bowels and are natural laxatives. 
Appendicitis, in ninety per cent of all cases, is caused 
by a sluggish, atrophic condition of the intestines. 

Huckleberries, blueberries, and blackben'ies are ex- 
cellent medicines, not only for diarrhoea, but for all 
other ailments of the digestive tract. In severe diar- 
rhoea, dysentery, bloody flux and cholera morbus, no 
food whatsoever should be taken, — only water mixed 
with acid fruit or berry juices. Blackberries and 
raspberries make delicious drinks and r.re fine tonics 
for weak stomachs. 

Nuts 

Nuts are by far the richest foods in Nature. They 
contain only about five per cent of water ; all the rest 
of their substance is solid nourishment. On an aver- 
age, they contain from ten to twenty per cent of 
proteins, fifty to sixty-five per cent of fats, five to 
ten per cent of carbohydrates, and from ten to twenty 
parts per thousand of the positive mineral elements. 

The most costly beefsteak contains only from twenty 
to thirty per cent of nourishing substance, and sev- 
enty per cent of impure water. 



MEDICINAli PROPERTIES OP RAW FOODS 23 

Nuts, on the other hand, are three times richer than 
meat in fats and proteins, and their delicious flavors 
are enjoyed best when eaten raw. They are, there- 
fore, the finest substitutes for meat in the diet of the 
vegetarian and fruitarian. The only danger lies in 
eating too many of them. They should be taken in 
moderate quantities only, and always in combination 
with foods of the mineral group. 

No wonder many people say "nuts do not agree 
with me," when they eat them by the handful after 
a heavy meal of meat, potatoes and vegetables. The 
vegetarian uses nuts, not with meat, but in place of 
meat. 

Many nut recipes will be found among "salads," 
"croquettes," "roasts," and "sandwich" fillings. 

Vegetables 

The leafy. Juicy vegetables which grow in and near 
the ground rank lower in proteins and starches and 
still higher in the positive mineral salts, than the 
fruits and berries. They are, therefore, best suited 
to balance in the diet the acid-producing starches, 
sugars, fats and proteins. The mineral salts, con- 
tained in the juicy vegetables in larger amounts than 
in any other class of foods, are the real blood, bone 
and nerve builders, the most valuable antiseptics, blood 
purifiers and generators of the positive, electro-mag- 
netic energies in the body. 

In the divisions, "Salads" and "Vegetables," we 
have described the best ways of preparing vegetables, 
uncooked and cooked. Among these recipes will be 
found the most delicious raw food combinations of 
berries, fruits, nuts and vegetables. 



S4 NATURE CUBE COOK BOOK 

None of the vegetables belonging to gronp five, 
which are relished raw, are improved by cooking. The 
cooking more or less destroys the vitamines and dissi- 
pates to some extent the vital energies latent in the 
vegetable protoplasm. 

Uncooked Cereals 

Seeds are highly charged with the sex principle, 
which in phj'-sical matter is the highest expression of 
the Life Force. All seeds, such as cereals, nuts, 
legumes, etc., which can be used as foods are, there- 
fore, especially rich in the life elements, in vital mag- 
netism or vitamines, and these vital energies remain 
unimpaired and most effective in the uncooked foods. 

While the digestive apparatus of the majority of 
people, through the constant use of cooked and highly 
spiced foods, has lost the ability to thoroughly digest 
and assimilate the raw starches of cereals, it is good 
practice to partake at one or more meals every day of 
some raw cereals, ground or cracked fresh in a hand 
mill, or soaked, dried and flaked in a grain and nut 
flaker. Flaked and rolled grains can be bought in 
every well-equipped grocery. A mixture of rolled oats, 
wheat and rye in about equal proportions, with addi- 
tions of pine nuts and raisins, makes an excellent and 
palatable substitute for baked bread. The flaked 
grains may be mixed according to individual taste and 
fancy, with various kinds of nuts, raisins, figs, dates, 
or other uncooked fruits and berries. A great variety 
of palatable and tempting uncooked strength-food 
dishes can be prepared in that way. 



MEDICINAL VEGETABLES 
Carrots and Beets Good Worm Remedies 

Carrots and beets are very rich in organic sugars and 
mineral salts, and are, therefore, excellent blood- 
builders, purifiers and anthelmintics. They are valu- 
able foods in all forms of anemic and acid diseases. 

Children should be allowed to eat all the raw carrots 
and beets they desire, especially when afflicted with 
intestinal parasites. 

Pumpkin Seeds, Good Tape-worm Remedy 

Peeled pumpkin seeds, administered after sufficient 
preparation by natural living, treatment and fasting, 
will harmlessly and promptly remove tape-worms, 
round-worms, pin-worms and other parasites. San- 
tonin, filix mas., and other poisonous anthelmintics 
may kill the worms, but they also paralyze the intes- 
tines, in many instances, causing lifelong intestinal 
constipation and indigestion. 

Flaxseed Tea for Colds 

Flaxseed tea is a valuable remedy for colds, croup 
and catarrhal diseases. It has a soothing and healing 
effect upon the raw and sore membranes of the throat, 
and upon the digestive and urinary organs. Take a 
few tablespoonfuls of this tea when needed to allay the 
soreness in the throat and bronchi. The best way to 
prepare this tea is to boil a tablespoon of flaxseed for 

25 



26 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

five minutes, then strain and add some honey and 
lemon juice. 

Rutabaga Syrup for Colds 

Rutabagas furnish another splendid remedy for 
colds, croups and catarrhs. Take a large rutabaga, 
scrub clean with vegetable brush but do not peel, 
then wipe dry. Remove top and scoop out center, 
leaving a shell about an inch and a half in thickness. 
Fill cavity with unrefined brown sugar or with pure 
maple sugar. Now place in a very slow oven or on top 
of a cookstove for eight to twelve hours, in such a 
way that the sugar and the juice of the rutabaga forms 
a thick syrup. Care must be taken that the applied 
heat is not too great, lest it bake the root and dry up 
the syrup. If the sugar absorbs too fast, more must 
be added. A teaspoonful of this syrup should be taken 
whenever needed to allay the irritation and soreness in 
the throat and bronchi. 

Kidney Tonics 

" Teas made from watercress, asparagus or juniper 
berries have a relaxing effect upon the urinary organs 
and are therefore valuable aids to promote the flow of 
scanty urine. Warm relaxing sitz baths and hot com- 
presses over the bladder are also valuable aids in 
relieving retention of urine. If the urinary organs are 
affected by inflammatory conditions, cooling com- 
presses and sitz baths must be applied. 

Onion and Grated Potato Poultices for Inflammations 

Slightly fried onions make excellent drawing and 
soothing poultices for inflammations in the middle ear. 



MEDICINAL VEGETABLES 27 

Grated raw potatoes applied as poultices are the best 
of all remedies in the worst forms of inflammations of 
the eyes such as glaucoma, trachoma, gonorrhoeal in- 
fection, iritis, etc. The raw potato poultices must 
be renewed before they become hot and dry. 

Cottage Cheese and Gruel Poultices 

Fresh cottage cheese and oat gruel poultices, warmed 
to blood heat, make good ripening and drawing poul- 
tices for runabout abscesses, boils, fuinineles, car- 
buncles and infected wounds. 

Horseradisli and Pineapple Good Counter-irritants 

Grated horseradish and pineapple and mustard make 
good drawing counter-irritant poultices for inflamma- 
tions in the throat, lungs, and other organs of the body. 
The juice of pineapples (raw or cooked) is a good 
remedy for colds, coughs and croup. 

Natura,! Laxatives 

The best natural laxatives are figs, prunes and 
raisins, raw or stewed. In febrile conditions and when 
solid food cannot be taken, give the juices. Eaisin 
juice acts better on some people than figs or prunes. 

Still others are aided greatly by eating young, green 
onions, Spanish onions, scraped sweet apples, or by 
taking raw rhubarb juice. 

Foods and Thirst 

Those who adopt a vegetarian diet soon find that 
they are not as thirsty and do not require nearly as 



28 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

large an amount of fluids as they did under the meat 
diet. The following explains why this is so. 

The juicy fruits and vegetables contain on an 
average about ninety per cent of water. These fruit 
and vegetable juices, prepared in Nature's own labora- 
tory, supply in the best possible form the demand for 
fluids in the animal and human body. They are cool- 
ing, refreshing, and saturated with the most valuable 
medicinal elements found in Nature. 

These vegetarian foods, therefore, are non-heating 
and non-irritating, and contain in themselves large 
amounts of pure and wholesome fluids. Flesh foods, 
as we have learned, are saturated with uric acid, 
poisonous alkaloids and ptomaines, which have a stim- 
ulating, heating and irritating effect upon the system. 
This is further increased by the spices and condiments 
necessary to cover the unpleasant odor and taste of the 
flesh. Large amounts of fluids are required to coun- 
teract the heating and coiToding effects of these sys- 
temic poisons, and to ''wash" them out of the system. 

Herein lies the reason why a meat diet creates 
abnormal thirst and is most conducive to the forming 
of the drink habit, while the adoption of a fruit and 
vegetable diet is the best remedy for the abnormal 
craving for drugs, tobacco, and spirituous liquors. 

POPULAR SUPEESTITIONS 

Strawberries and Cucumbers — Purifiers, Not Poisons 

Strawberries, cucumbers, tomatoes, and other medic- 
inal fruits and vegetables are called poison foods by 
writers on hygienic subjects of the Woods-Hutchinson 
type, because they produce skin eruptions, diarrhoeas 
and other forms of acute elimination. 



MEDICINAL VEGETABLES 29 

Cucumbers, as they come from the garden, are medi- 
cine to the human body, especially in diarrhoeas and 
cholera morbus. They are homeopathic to such condi- 
tions. It is wrong to soak them in salt, pepper and 
vinegar. In their natural state they ■ are great puri- 
fiers, counteracting the poisons of flesh foods, alcohol 
and tobacco. Because they eliminate the noxious 
accumulations of these pbisons in a somewhat drastic 
manner many physicians and popular ignorance regard 
them as harmful and poisonous. This is "blaming 
the broom for raising the dust." "When properly pre- 
pared, or rather when not prepared at all, aside from 
cleansing, they rank among the most wholesome prod- 
ucts of the soil. 

The rinds of the cucumbers contain a valuable kidney 
tonic and should not be removed if tender and pala- 
table. 

Grape fruit does not contain quinine, though, like 
all other acid and sub-acid fruits and vegetables, for 
reasons elsewhere explained, it is an excellent remedy 
in all inflammatory febrile diseases. 

Tomatoes do not make cancer, but help to cure it. 
Most of our cancer patients, at one time or another 
while undergoing treatment, usually during the healing 
crises, develop a strong appetite for tomatoes, and we 
always encourage them to satisfy this craving to the 
fullest extent. 

No Opium in Lettuce 

Lettuce is a splendid remedy for soothing tired and 
irritated nerves, and for relieving insomnia. Its seda- 
tive qualities, however, are not due to opium. Lettuce 
does not contain the slightest trace of opium, but it 
is very rich in the positive, alkaline mineral elements. 



30 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

These neutralize and eliminate the poisonous acids and 
alkaloids which irritate and over stimulate the brain 
and nervous system, and cause all kinds of nervous 
troubles. 

Peaches do not contain prussic acid. It is true 
that the seed of the peach contains minute quantities 
of this poison — not enough to be harmful — ^but the 
luscious flesh of the peach doe's not contain the slightest 
trace. It is too bad that people should be frightened 
from enjoying one of Nature's most delicious and 
wholesome products through this foolish superstition. 

Neither do watermelons cause malaria. This is a 
wide-spread, superstitious belief among southern 
people, for whom plenty of fresh watermelons in their 
season would be the best possible preventive of malaria. 
True, watermelons, like all other foods, in a condition 
of decay, may become dangeroiis to health, but when 
ripe and fresh this delicious, juicy fruit is one of 
Nature's finest cooling and purifying medicines — one 
of the best known cures for malaria and other febrile 
diseases peculiar to hot climates. If the southern 
people would use more watermelons and other juicy 
fruits during the heated seasons, instead of too much 
lard and other greasy foods — for which they seem to 
have a curious fancy — they would not be so prone to 
these maladies. 



SIMPLE VEGETABLE SALADS AND DRESSINGS 

Vegetable Salads 

Though the following recipes appear scattered 
among the ** Salads," we give them here in a condensed 
form for the benefit of those who look for a collection 
of simple raw-food recipes. 

Any of the following named green vegetables may 
be served singlj'- or in various combinations with the 
dressings below, e. g. : 

Lettuce is very appetizing with lemon juice and 
sugar only, or with any of the dressings. 

Cucumbers may be sliced in the ordinary way with 
any of the first seven dressings. They are very pala- 
table when quartered lengthwise and sprinkled with 
lemon juice and olive oil. 

Sliced onions, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, endive, 
Swiss chard, young can'ots, green peas in the pods, 
nasturtiums, celery, cabbage slaw, young spinach, 
parsley, water cress, and dandelions are all good with 
any of the dressings mentioned, to suit individual 
taste. Water cress is very palatable with lemon juice 
and olive oil. The flavor of tomatoes blends well 
with mayonnaise, or with dressing No. 6.

SOUPS 

Key to reference letters: St. (Starches). S. (Sugars). P» 
(Fats). P. (Proteids). M. (Mineral Elements). 

In the natural diet, we tolerate rather than recom- 
mend the use of soups. They are objectionable for sev- 
eral reasons. 

Most soups are not relished except when taken hot, 
and hot foods, especially liquids, have the effect of 
anaesthetizing, weakening and dilating the stomach. 
Moreover, like all other liquids, they dilute the diges- 
tive juices, all of which tends to weaken and retard the 
digestion of foods in the stomach. 

Soups should be taken slowly and as cool as thej' 
can be relished. It is well to take with the soup some 
solid food, such as whole grain bread, whole wheat 
croutons or triscuits, or some vegetable relish, such as 
radishes, onions, celery, etc. 

It is not at all necessary to begin every dinner with 
soup. It should not be served more than two or three 
times a week. The soup habit should be avoided. 

Meat Soups 

As far as meat soups are concerned, instead of con- 
taining the strength of the meat, as commonly sup- 
posed, they contain much of uric acid and other mor- 
bid materials with which the animal carcass is satu- 
rated, and in addition to this some fats and gelatin, 
but very little of the protein elements. The latter 
coagulate and remain in the meat fiber. 

33 



84 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

"Well-inforraed physicians now admit that soups and 
meat extracts have more of a stimulating than a nour- 
ishing effect upon the system. This artificial stimula. 
tion is caused by the poisonous acids, alkaloids and 
ptomaines contained in the meat. The most valuable 
constituents of flesh foods, the animal life element or 
animal magnetism, is largely destroyed and dissipated 
through boiling. 

Vegetable Soups 

Pure vegetable soups, properly prepared, are rich in 
the mineral elements, which are of the greatest impor- 
tance in the economy of the body, but care must be 
taken not to boil the vegetable soups longer than 
necessary, in order to avoid as much as possible the 
disintegration of the live-organic combinations of the 
vegetable food elements and the dissipation of the vito- 
chemical life element (vitamines). 

The foundation of vegetable soups is a stock made 
from different leafy vegetables and roots, with a very 
small addition of peas or beans to supply the rich 
flavor of the protein which makes meat soups so pala- 
table. 

All vegetables may thus be utilized with the possible 
exception of the red beet, which would impart a 
reddish color to the stock. The outer leaves of cab- 
bage, spinach, lettuce, kale, the tops of beets and 
other roots, the tough portions of celery, asparagus 
and green onions, which usually go to waste, make 
excellent soup stock, because they are rich in the min- 
eral salts, — the essential elements in good soup. 

To clarify the stock, use crushed egg-shells. This 
is another by-product of the kitchen that is generally 
thought fit only for the garbage can ; yet the lime and 



SOUPS 85 

other minerals contained in the shells of the eggs are 
valuable elements of nutrition. The egg-shells should 
be washed, dried in the oven, crushed and kept in a 
covered jar until required for clarifying soups and 
cereal coffee.

36. Cream of Tomato— 11 

Groups 3VL F. S. P.— St. 

Cook and strain through a coarse sieve 1 quart 
tomatoes. Reheat to boiling point, and thicken with 
a little cornstarch. In a saucepan melt 1 large table- 
spoon butter, sift in 1 tablespoon flour, and let cook 
until perfectly smooth, then add slowly sufficient hot 
milk to make 1 quart. Heat to boiling, mix with the 
tomatoes, season, and add more butter and a little 
sugar, if desired. This will not curdle. 

Note : — Many people experience difficulty on account 
of the curdling of the milk. The secret of success lies 
in using fresh milk, and having both the milk and 
tomatoes at equal temperature at the time of mixing. 
It is better to add the tomatoes to the milk, not vice 
versa. If there is any doubt about the freshness of 
the milk, a small amount of baking soda added to the 
tomatoes will counteract the acidity ; but this addition 
of inorganic soda to food is undesirable and should 
be avoided.

UNCOOKED SOUPS 

Note: — ^For those readers who wish to adhere to a 
strictly uncooked diet, we have added a few recipes of 
soups made from vegetables and fruits without the use 
of fire in their preparation. 

As will be noticed, it is possible to make combina- 
tions and have variety just as well as in cooked soups. 
Honey has been used in preference to the commercial 
sugar, because the latter is not an "uncooked" prod- 
uct. Furthermore, honey imparts a distinct flavor to 
the food which greatly improves it. It will also be 
found that, by using vegetables in the uncooked state, 
the desire for salt is greatly lessened. 

Fruits and vegetables containing acid are liable to 
form poisonous compounds with the metal in tin or 
copper vessels and granite ware in which the enamel 
has been cracked. It is therefore advisable to use 
aluminum vessels or porcelain-lined vessels and uten- 
sils.

SALADS 

Key to reference letters: St. (Starches). S. (Sugars). P. 
(Fats). P. (Proteids). M. (Mineral Elements). 

The leafy, juicy vegetables are most beneficial when 
eaten raw, prepared with lemon juice and olive oil. 
Never use vinegar or pepper and salt with raw vege- 
tables. Lemon juice is the most delicious substitute 
for vinegar. Vinegar, a product of fermentation, is a 
powerful antiseptic and preservative. It is useful for 
preserving food in the pantry, but it is not advisable 
to preserve the food in our stomachs. Vinegar retards 
digestion, lemon juice promotes it. An exception to 
this is the digestion of the starches in the stomach 
which is somewhat retarded by acid fruit and vegetable 
juices. Mayonnaise and French dressings should be 
prepared with lemon juice instead of vinegar. 

Every meal should contain a considerable proportion 
of uncooked fruits and vegetables, which are best 
served in the form of tempting salads. However, we 
have not confined ourselves to salads made from raw 
fruits and vegetables, because we wish to make our 
cook book thoroughly practical in the average home 
and thereby insure its greatest possible usefulness. 

In the summer time salads should take the place, to 
a large extent, of soups and cooked foods. For 
luncheon, an appetizing fruit or vegetable salad with 
whole grain bread and, if desired, a glass of milk or 
fruit juice, will be found fully satisfying and sufficient 
for the brain worker, as well as for those engaged in 
physical labor.

68 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

There are certain rules regarding the preparation of 
salads which should be observed under all circum- 
stances : 

(1) Strong condiments and spices should not be used 
at all or very sparingly only. They over-stimulate and 
thereby irritate the digestive organs, the nerves and 
sex centers, interfere with proper digestion and assimi- 
lation, and thus result in a corresponding -degree of 
weakness which affects the entire organism. 

(2) Lemon juice should be used instead of vinegar, 
especially in the preparation of raw food salads, for 
reasons before stated. 

(3) Seasoning and dressing should be added at the 
last moment, just before serving. 

A simple and effective way to prepare a salad is to 
arrange crisp lettuce leaves on a plate or platter and 
on these put the ingredients of the salad, such as 
chopped or diced fruits and vegetables, either mixed 
together or in sections. The dressing may be mixed 
with the ingredients or added separately. Generally, 
cream dressing or whipped cream is used with fruit 
salads, and mayonnaise or French dressing with those 
composed of vegetables. Chopped or ground nuts, 
minced parsley, shredded green peppers or pimentoes, 
sprinkled over the salad, add to its attractiveness, 
flavor and nutritive value. Eipe olives, small radishes, 
or grapes halved and seeded, may be used as gar- 
nishes. 

Sliced hard-boiled eggs or ripe olives are a suitable 
garnish for a vegetable salad, while large, perfect rasp- 
berries or blackberries go well with fruit salads. If 
apples or pears are used they should be served imme- 
diately or placed in cold water imtil needed, to prevent 
discoloration.

CROQUETTES 

Key to reference letters: St. (Starches). S. (Sugars). 
F. (Fats). P. (Proteids). M. (Mineral Elements). 

Croquettes prepared from protein and starchy foods, 
such as roots, tubers, pulses, cereals and nuts, mixed 
with vegetables and fruits, take in the vegetarian diet 
the place of the meat-eater's steaks, chops and roasts. 
Many of the recipes herein given closely resemble 
fried meats in appearance and taste, as well as in 
similarity of elements of nutrition. 

"While these preparations may not appeal to some 
of our vegetarian friends, who prefer their food in 
the natural form, and while these "near meats" may 
be too heavy for people with weak digestions, we have 
added a number of recipes of palatable vegetable cro- 
quettes and will leave their use or non-use to individ- 
ual taste and judgment. 

General Directions for Making Croquettes 

In mixing the ingredients here to be given, for the 
following recipes, have the mass firm enough not to 
fall apart, but not compact. Likewise the croquettes 
should be handled as little as possible in shaping. 
Large spoons may be used for this purpose. In order 
to provide a firm and well-browned outer crust, the 
croquettes should be rolled first in sifted bread or 
cracker crumbs, then in beaten egg, then again in 
crumbs.

Frying or Baking — Which is Best? 

The ordinary restaurant way of frying breaded 
chops, oysters, potato croquettes, etc., by dropping 
them into boiling oil, makes these foods soggy, indi- 
gestible and unpalatable. Better than this is careful 
frying in skillet or pan, but according to our expe- 
rience, the best way of all to prepare vegetable cro- 
quettes is the baking or roasting. 

Frying in Oil 

The croquettes are placed in a frying basket and 
submerged in hot oil; when well done, drain and 
place the basket on soft wrapping paper. There must 
be enough hot vegetable oil, or pure animal fat (butter 
or oleomargarine), to cover them entirely. The oil 
must be very hot, but should not smoke. If done 
carefully, the hot oil coming in contact with the food 
will form a soft crust and prevent the oil from soak- 
ing in. 

After use, the oil may be clarified by heating in it 
a few slices of potatoes and carefully pouring it from 
the sediment. It may then be used again, adding 
more as required. 

Skillet or Pan Frying 

The croquettes are rolled in bread crumbs and beaten 
egg ass before and placed in a well-buttered or oiled 
skillet or pan and turned from time to time until 
well browned. 

Baking 

Place the croquettes on a hot, buttered gridiron or 
agate baking-pan, and place in a very hot oven. Let 



CROQUETTES, ROASTS, ETC. 113 

them brown nicely, then turn and brown on opposite 
side.

Key to reference letters: St. (Starches). 0, (Sugars).

Leafy and Juicy Vegetables 

Leafy and juicy vegetables are the most valuable 
foods of the mineral salts group (Group V). While 
the juicy, acid and sub-acid fruits average from twenty 
to fifty parts per thousand of the positive mineral 
salts of iron, sodium, lime, magnesium and potassium, 
the non-starchy, leafy and juicy vegetables average 
from seventy to one hundred and fifty parts per thou- 
sand of these all-important, physiological and medic- 
inal mineral elements. 

On pages 400, 401 we have dilated upon the value of 
these positive, alkaline, mineral elements as neutral- 
izers and eliminators of poisonous acids and alkaloids, 
as blood, nerve and bone builders, as the principal 
ingredients in all the important secretions of the body, 
and as generators and conductors of electro-magnetic 
energy. "We called attention to the fact that the juices 
of fmits and vegetables, prepared in Nature's own 
laboratory, supply in the best possible form the de- 
mands for fluids in the animal and human body. They 
are natural tonics, cholagogues and purifiers. They 
dilute and hold in solution the morbid, colloid products 
of starchy and protein digestion. The large amount 
of woody fiber (cellulose) contained in the vegetables 
furnishes solid resistance to the intestines and thereby 

134 



VEGETABLES 135 

stimulates their peristaltic movements and makes very 
efficient scourers, purifiers and natural laxatives. 

Richest in the positive mineral elements are cabbage, 
spinach, lettuce, watercress, savoy cabbage, endive, 
rose kale, Brussels sprouts, Scotch kale, leek, celery 
and parsley. Next to these rank tomatoes, cucumbers, 
radishes, onions, horseradish, green peppers, aspara- 
gus and cauliflower. 

Splendid cooling and refreshing summer foods, rich 
in the purifying organic salts, are the watermelons, 
muskmelons, cantaloupes, pumpkins, squashes, and 
other members of the melon family. 

The Preparation and Cooking of Vegetables 

Most vegetables and fruits are not improved by 
cooking. However, many diet reformers go to extremes 
when they claim that all or nearly all the organic 
mineral combinations in vegetables and fruits are ren- 
dered inorganic through cooking. This is an exag- 
geration. Cooking is merely a mechanical process of 
subdivision, not a chemical one, and mechanical proc- 
esses of subdivision do not disorganize organic mole- 
cules to any great extent. 

However, it remains true that the fruits and vege- 
tables mentioned under group five are not improved 
by cooking. 

Starchy vegetables and cereals only are improved by 
cooking, and this is so because through ages of abuse 
our digestive organs have lost the power to digest and 
assimilate raw starch. The cooking serves to break up 
and separate the hard 'starch granules and to facilitate 
the penetration of the digestive juices. 

After the ieaiy vegetables are thoroughly cleansed 



136 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

and ready for cooking, place them in the cooking ves- 
sel, add just enough water to keep them from burning, 
then cover and allow to simmer slowly in their own 
juices. The leafy vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, 
kale, etc., contain enough water for their own cooking. 

Do not waste any of the juices, because they contain 
most of the mineral elements. "When cooking such 
vegetables as carrots, beets, asparagus, parsnips, oyster- 
plant, etc., which require considerable water for boil- 
ing, do not throw away the water, but use it for the 
making of soups and sauces. All vegetables may be 
steamed instead of boiled, if preferred. 

If the vegetables, as is the usual custom, are boiled 
in large quantities of water, then drained, or what is 
still worse, pressed out and seasoned with soup stock, 
strong condiments and spices, they have lost their 
nutritive and medicinal value. The mineral salts have 
vanished in the sink, the remains have become insipid 
and indigestible and therefore have to be highly sea- 
soned in order to make them palatable. 

Asparagus 

Asparagus runs low in protein (2%) and starches 
and sugar (2%), but high in the five positive mineral 
elements, about 50 per mill. 

339. Asparagus in Ambush

CEREAL FOODS 

Key to reference letters: St. (Starches). S. (Sugars). 
F. (Fats). P. (Proteids). M. (Mineral Elements). 

Cereal foods, on account of their great abundance, 
cheapness, keeping qualities and easy transportability, 
comprise, by far, the largest and most important part 
of human food. Some varieties of grains, corn, buck- 
wheat, or rice can be gro"VYn in almost any habitable 
locality on earth. However, grains and rice by them- 
selves are not well-balanced foods, as shown in our 
tables of food analysis. 

White Flour and Polished Rice 

Cereals contain large quantities of gluten (from 
eight to twelve per cent) which is equal in nourish- 
ing qualities to tiie protein of flesh foods. Further- 
more, they contain from one to two per cent of fats, 
and from 65 to 75 per cent of starchy food elements. 
The all-important mineral elements, however, are rep- 
resented in small quantities only, from eight to thir- 
teen parts per thousand, and the larger part of these 
is lost in the refining process in the mill in order to 
comply with the fashionable demand for white flour 
and white rice. 

This foolish but almost universal custom necessi- 
tates not only the removal of the mineral salts which 
are located in and under the hulls, but also of a large 
proportion of the gluten, which is equal in nourishing 

267 



268 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

value to meat; worst of all, it involves the loss of the 
Vitamines (see pages 13, 14). 

The white flour and polished rice of commerce, hav- 
ing been robbed of their mineral constituents in the 
milling process, contain only from one to three parts 
per thousand of mineral elements. 

Just think of the wasteful foolishness of this prac- 
tice! The valuable gluten and mineral salts go into 
the bran and help to build up the healthy, powerful 
bodies of our domestic animals, while man, the ' ' Crown 
of Creation, ' ' grows dyspeptic, anaemic, thin and nerv- 
ous on the white, starchy flour, robbed of its most im- 
portant elements of nutrition. 

Furthermore, it is well to consider how this foolish 
practice contributes to the high cost of living; the 
protein-gluten of the grains, which costs from two to 
three cents per pound, or less if gi'ound at home, is 
discarded in the bran, and in place of it, meat-protein, 
contaminated by all the morbid matter and systemic 
poisons of the animal carcass, is bought in the butcher 
shop at the cost of 10 to 30 cents per pound. 

Government investigation of the dreadful beri-beri 
disease, which since the American occupation has in- 
creased to an alarming extent in the Philippines and 
Hawaiian Islands, has revealed the fact that this dis- 
ease is caused by the consumption of polished rice. 
When the patients suffering from this malady are given 
even small quantities of the "polishings" of the rice, 
which contain the "Vitamines" of the cereal, they 
recover quickly. 

While our "polished" white flonr cannot be held 
directly responsible for such a serious disease as beri- 
beri, it is difficult to tell how much it has to do with 
the creation of the manifold ailments from which the 



CEREAL POODS 269 

civilized portion of humanity is suffering. Surely, the 
discovery of the cause of beri-beri should be a strong 
warning against ''polishing" our grains in a similar 
manner as the rice. 

"We may safely assume that the Great "Wisdom which 
created this wonderful human body knows also how 
to feed it, and that, therefore, the safest way is to 
consume foods as nearly as possible in the forms in 
which they come from Nature's hands. If food has 
to pass through the processes of cooking, spicing, fer- 
menting and chemical treatment before it becomes 
edible and palatable, it is not a natural food. 

The Structure and Chemical Properties of a Kernel 
of Wheat 

To illustrate the fatal mistakes which are made in 
the production of "super-fine" white flour and other 
artificial cereal-food products, we give below the dia-. 
gram of a wheat kernel, greatly enlarged. This illus- 
tration is taken from "The Foundation of All Eeform," 
by Otto Carque, an excellent little treatise on the diet 
question. 

The outer layer, 1, is the hull, or tough, outer coat- 
ing, which, broken up into fine, bran particles, fur- 
nishes necessary bulk in the digestive tract. The par- 
ticles of ground hull in the whole grain meal, act as 
a splendid stimulant to the peristaltic movements of 
the bowels. They also sem^e to keep the starchy con- 
stituents of the grain from forming lumpy masses in 
the digestive tract. They separate the starchy par- 
ticles so that the digestive juices can better penetrate 
and digest the starchy and protein mass. For these 
reasons whole grain bread and cereal preparations act 



270 NATURE CURE COOK DOOK 

as natural laxatives, while bread and pastry made from 
white flour, together with meat, coffee, tea, strong 
spices and condiments are the most prominent causes 
of indigestion and constipation. 

What little the kernel of grain possesses of the all- 
important positive mineral salts of iron, lime, sodium, 
potassium and magnesium and the Vitamines, are con- 
tained in and under the hull. The black, powdery 
deposit underneath the hull also consists of mineral 
elements. 

It is the mineral salts which give textile strength 




and toughness to the hulls of grains and to the pro- 
tecting skins and rinds of fruits and vegetables, and, 
therefore, when tender and palatable, these should al- 
ways be eaten together with the inner, meaty parts of 
the foods. 

Layers 2 and 3 contain nitrogenous matter and are 
rich in the alkaline, mineral salts of silicon, phosphorus 
and potassium, which build bones and teeth. 

In layers 4 and 5 we find a cerealine substance which 
gives color and flavor to the kernel. 

Layer 6 consists mostly of gluten, while the interior, 
white body (7) is made up principally of starch. 



CEREAL POODS 271 

Eight is the germ which contains the life-principle, 
and valuable, easy-soluble organic salts. The germ 
also contains the natural ferments of the grain which, 
under the influence of moisture and warmth in the soil, 
change the starchy and proteid materials into sugars 
and peptones, which serve as food for the growing 
stalk and roots, in like manner as the substance of the 
egg serves as food for the growing chick. 

Diastase is the ferment which changes starch into 
dextrine and sugar, and peptase is the ferment Avhich 
changes proteid into proteose and peptones. 

From all the brands of flour manufactured in the 
modern roller mills, the germs have been removed, be- 
cause otherwise the flour or meal will quickly deterio- 
rate, ferment and breed maggots, due to the action of 
the live ferments in the germ. These ferments, how- 
ever, perform the same work as the digestive juices 
in the system. Therefore, by depriving the flour of 
^he germs, its keeping qualities are improved, but on 
the other hand it is robbed of the most valuable fer- 
ments, which greatly facilitate the digestion of the 
starches and proteins. 

In the preparation of white flour, laj'ers 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, and the life germ with its valuable salts and fer- 
ments, are removed, leaving a product which has been 
robbed of its most valuable constituents and finest 
qualities and which, therefore, is unfit for food. 

In the preparation of bread from such devitalized 
flour, the live-organic mineral salts must be replaced by 
the inorganic table salt, and the organic ferments, 
diastase and peptase, must be replaced by yeast, soda, 
alum, cream of tartar, and other harmful, mineral 
baking powders.

Bohemian Rye 

The ordinary rye flour, the so-called Bohemian rye, 
is made on the same principle as white flour, that is, 
much of the gluten, the hull, and the organic salts 
have been removed in the milling process. Further- 
more, this brand of flour is frequently mixed with infe- 
rior white flour, which, on accoimt of its dark color,' 
cannot be sold as such. 

Rye Meal 

The rye meal from which the Germans prepare their 
dark rye bread, if ground in an old-fashioned stone- 
burr mill, contains all the constituents of the rye, and 
is, therefore, good material for our health bread. 

Graham Flour 

The original graham flour, as advocated by Dr. Syl- 
vester Graham, was made of the entire wheat, but the 
graham flour of commerce as now sold, is usually pre- 
pared by mixing bran with shorts. 

Whole Wheat Flour 

Many of the so-called whole wheat flours are not 
whole wheat in fact. While they contain the starchy 
and glutenous parts of the cereals, — the hulls, and with 
them the mineral salts, have been removed in the mill- 
ing process, under the mistaken idea that the hulls of 
cereals are too coarse and irritating and therefore in- 
jurious to the digestive tract. This is in line with much 
other "wisdom of the schools," which presumes to 
know better what is good for beast and man than 
Mother Nature. 



CEREAL POODS 273 

Gluten Flour 

From the viewpoint of our low protein diet, gluten 
flour and protose are positively dangerous. They are 
the concentrated extracts of the gluten or proteid mat- 
ter of grains, legumes and nuts. 

Gluten flour is highly recommended to people suffer- 
ing from diabetes. We, however, hold that a high pro- 
teid diet is much more dangerous in diabetes than a 
diet containing moderate amounts of starches and 
sugars. Functional diabetes is caused largely by the 
clogging of the capillary circulation with uric acid and 
other morbid materials, produced in the digestion of 
proteid food. This will be more fully explained in the 
next following volume of this series, entitled, "Natural 
Dietetics." 

Protose 

Protose is an extract of the protein materials of 
grains, legumes, and nuts, even more concentrated than 
gluten flour, and therefore a more unbalanced food and 
more dangerous to health. Such artificially unbalanced 
food products, if used at all, must be taken together 
with liberal proportions of the food of the mineral 
group, (V). 

From the foregoing it becomes apparent why it is 
almost impossible to buy in the open market a genuine 
whole grain flour or meal. 

Practically the only way to obtain flour which eon- 
tains all the constituents of the grain, is either to pro- 
cure it from an old-fashioned stone-burr mill, or to 
grind it at home fresh for daily use, on one of our 
small hand-grain mills, which we sell at $4.50 each,

Breakfast Foods 

Freshly ground or cracked grains not only make 
the best bread, but also delicious mushes and gruels. 
Of the many cereal and breakfast foods on the market, 
those are the best which are made of the whole of the

A good whole grain bread is the very foundation of 
a rational vegetarian diet. "We soon realized this when 
we first tried to live on a vegetarian diet, and when we 
entered upon the Sanitarium work. 

"We tried certain brands of so-called ** whole-wheat 
flour," but found that while they contained the gluten- 



276 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

ous and starchy parts of the grain, they were entirely 
lacking in the bran, and, therefore, in the long mn, 
entirely unsatisfactory. 

We then tried graham flour, and found that the 
bread made from it was dry and straw-like in flavor. 

We found that the common (Bohemian) rye flour was 
prepared in a similar way to the common white wheaten 
flour, and that it suffered from the same disadvantages. 

The German whole rye "Pumpernickel" bread is pre- 
pared by sour fermentation, and therefore tends to sour 
the contents of the digestive tract. 

We also tried various whole grain unfermented 
"health breads." Most of these were coarse, unpala- 
table, tough and lumpy, and we found that our patients 
as well as ourselves could not use them for some length 
of time without experiencing detrimental effects on 
the digestive organs. 

In short, we found that all the popular brands of 
flour and the various kinds of bread made from them, 
were lacking in some important constituents and were 
not as palatable and digestible as w^e desired. We then 
proceeded to try the Golden Mean, and to combine the 
best qualities of different kinds of flours and meals 
into one perfect palatable and wholesome bread, and 
we believe that we have succeeded in solving the prob- 
lem. 

The bread that we have now been using uninter- 
ruptedly for many years has satisfied all demands as 
to pleasantness of flavor and perfect digestibility. 

In making our "staff of life," we have wandered 
away from the straight and narrow path of simon-pure 
vegetarianism to such an extent as to leaven our bread 
with real yeast or with some of the sponge of the last 
baking. (See Fermented Bread, pages 455 to 459.) 



CEREAL FOODS 277 

The bread is made in the following manner: Take 
Yq white flour for sponge, set with good yeast or with 
dough from last baking (kept sweet under ice) ; when 
this sponge has sufficiently risen, work into it care- 
fully Ys whole grain or graham flour and % rye meal 
(not the ''bohemian" rye flour). Raise and bake 
slowly. 

This bread combines the lightness of white flour with 
the glutenous qualities and organic salts of graham 
bread, and the wliole rye imparts to it a sweet, rich 
flavor which cannot be obtained from any other kind 
of flour. The worst dyspeptics seem to digest and 
assimilate this bread better than any other kind. 
Americans, who have never been accustomed to coarse, 
-dark bread, almost without exception like it and soon 
cannot do without it. It happens continually that one 
of our patients takes home our bread for his own use 
and within a few weeks he reports that everybody in 
the house is eating it with relish and satisfaction.

or with leavened dough from the last baking, which has 
been kept cold and sweet. When the sponge has risen 
sufficiently, work the graham flour and rye meal into it. 
Thorough kneading is of importance. Let rise slowly

Croups St. P.— S. F. 

Make a sponge in the evening by adding a cake of 
yeast foam (which has previously been softened in a 
little water) to a batter made from 1 tablespoon mashed 
potatoes and a pint of water in which the potato has 
been boiled, with sufficient good bread flour stirred in 
so that the batter will drop from the spoon, not run as 
liquid. Let this rise in a warm place after giving it a 
good beating. (The lighter it gets the better.) Then 
add a pint of lukewarm water, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 
teaspoon sugar, also a little oil. Knead Avith the hands 
until when poked with the finger tip it seems elastic 
and does not stick to the finger. Cover and let rise 
over night in a warm place, 75 degrees. In the morn-

masher for twenty minutes, working in as much flour 
as possible. Roll and cut into two-inch squares, place 
on a greased baking sheet, such as cookies are baked 
on, and let rise until nearly twice their height, or until 
very light. Bake in a moderately hot oven about half 
an hour, then leave in the warming oven or about the 
stove somewhere to dry out thoroughly for a day or 
two. Keep in a dry place. 

When wanted, roll over once or twice in cold water,

LEGUMINOUS POODS 

Key to reference letters: St. (Starches). S. (Sugars). 
F. (Fats). P. (Proteids). M. (Mineral Elements). 

The principal representatives of this class of foods 
are peas, beans and lentils. They are also called pulses. 
These foods are exceedingly rich in proteid and starchy 
materials. "While the costliest beefsteak contains from 
70 to 75 per cent of water, and very unclean water at 
that, the pulses contain only about 10 per cent water, 
with all the rest solid nourishment. While meat con- 
tains about 20 per cent proteid, the pulses contain from 
20 to 25 per cent proteid and in addition to that from 
50 to 54 per cent of starches. 

It is the very wealth of these foods in the negative, 
acid-forming proteid and starchy elements, which, like 
the cereals, make them at the same time, next to meat, 
the greatest of danger foods. 

The proteid materials of the pulses are made up of 
six elements, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phos- 
phorus and sulphur. In the digestion and other vital 
processes in the system these food materials are broken 
down, and the elements composing them form many 
kinds of poisonous acids, alkaloids and ptomaines. 

On the other hand these foods are very poor in the 
acid binding and eliminating positive mineral elements. 
Almost all diseases arising in the human organism are 
caused originally by the accumulation of these morbid 
materials. 

The effect of these poisons has been described in the 

284 



LEGUMINOUS POODS 285 

chapter entitled "Acid Diseases," in "Nature Cure," 
and in Part II of this volume. 

Young peas and beans, however, as long as they are 
in the pulpy, juicy stage, are low in proteid and 
starchy materials, but rich in sugar and the positive 
alkaline mineral elements. As the ripening process 
proceeds, a great chemical change takes place, — a con- 
siderable percentage of the mineral elements recede 
into the leaves and stalks of the plant, while the seed 
greatly increases in protein and starchy elements. 
Therefore, sweet, young, juicy peas and beans belong 
to Group V (mineral group), while the ripe and hard- 
ened pulses belong to Groups I (starches) and IV (pro- 
teids). 

In view of the fact that the pulses and cereals possess 
about three times the amount of nourishing materials 
in comparison to meat, the popular belief in the extraor- 
dinary nourishing qualities of meat seems pure super- 
stition. 

As stated before, the danger in the cereals and legu- 
minous foods lies in their being too rich in the proteid 
and starchy elements. This becomes more apparent 
when we compare these food classes with our standard 
food, the milk. We find that milk, which nature pro- 
vides as food for the newborn and growing animal, 
contains only 4 per cent of proteid and 5 per cent of 
sugar, while the pulses contain about 25 per cent of 
proteid and 60 per cent of starches. Still we would 
expect that the young and growing animal and human 
bodies need much more of the cell and tissue building 
proteid than the full-grown and completed adult body. 

On account of their great richness in the negative, 
acid-forming proteid and starchy materials, the pulses 
and cereals must always be combined with the foods 



286 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

of the fifth (mineral) group, which are low in proteids 
and starches and run comparatively high in the posi- 
tive mineral elements, which neutralize and eliminate 
the poisonous acids and alkaloids produced by the nega- 
tive acid-forming foods. 

Do not use vinegar with the pulses; always use 
lemon juice. The latter is rich in the positive mineral 
elements, while vinegar is entirely devoid of them, and 
being a strong antiseptic, retards the digestion of the 
already heavy pulses. 

NUTS 

Nuts are the richest of all foods. They contain only 
about 5 per cent water, while the highly priced meats 
contain from 70 to 75 per cent water. Nuts contain 
about 17 per cent of proteid, many times more than 
Nature's standard in the milk (4 per cent), and in addi- 
tion to this from 50 to 75 per cent of fat. For these 
reasons nuts should be used sparingly only, and always 
in connection with foods of the fifth group. 

Considering the great richness of the nuts, in pro- 
teids and fats, it is no wonder that people complain 
about "nuts not agreeing with them," especially when 
eating a large amomit of them after a heavy meal of 
meats and other foods. In the natural diet, nuts, pulses 
and cereals are used in place of meat, not with meat. 

The cocoanut differs from other nuts in that it con- 
tains less fats and proteids and more organic salts. 
The meat of the cocoanut, together with its milk, comes 
nearer to the chemical composition of human milk than 
any food product in existence. 

Some vegetarians allow peanuts a prominent place in 
their diet. But this is a mistake, since peanuts con- 
tain a higher percentage of proteid (33 per cent) than 



. LEGUMINOUS POODS 287 

almost any other article of food, and also considerable 
xantheins, which have the same deleterious effects upon 
the system as an excess of uric acid. 

Pignolia or Pine nuts, though very rich in proteids 
and fats, seem to be more easily digestible than most 
other nuts. We have always found them a most valu- 
able food for people with weak digestion.

To Cook Rice 

In the following recipes we give different methods 
of boiling rice. Upon the proper cooking of rice de- 
pends its food value and its digestibility. 

If it can be procured, the natui'al unpolished rice 
should be used instead of the polished and artificially 
bleached product of commerce. 

Rice should be well washed in several waters and 
rubbed between the hands or between two clean towels 
to remove the coating of talcum found upon it in nearly 
every instance. 

Unpolished rice contains only about seven parts per 
thousand of the positive mineral elements. The pol- 
ished rice has been robbed almost entirely of its mineral 
elements and of the vitamines. 

815. Boiled Rice (1) 

Groups St. P. 

To 1 cup rice add 3 cups cold water and salt to 
taste ; let come to boiling gradually ; boil hard for about 
five minutes, then keep on an asbestos mat over a low 
flame, with cover partly removed, until the water has 
steamed off. This will leave the rice dry and well- 
cooked.

There is something in animal food which we cannot 
secure from purely vegetable food, — and that is the 
animal (magnetic) life element, or, as we usually call 
it, the animal magnetism. Each kingdom in nature is 
animated and controlled by a higher form, or element, 
of the great life force. This aspect of the diet ques- 
tion, which is entirely left out of consideration by most 
of our vegetarian friends, is fully treated in Part II 
of this volume. 

However, in order to secure the benefit of the animal 
magnetism contained in animal foods, we do not have 
to eat meat contaminated with all the impurities of the 
animal carcass. We can secure all we need of this ani- 
mal life element in the dairy products in the best possi- 
ble and purest form. 

Flesh foods we have to boil, bake, fry and spice 
heavily in order to disguise the unpleasant taste and 
odor of the dead flesh, and thereby much of the animal 
magnetism is lost. All the dairy products we can eat 
raw, and in that way derive the full benefit of the 
animal magnetism which they contain. Therefore the 
liberal use of the dairy products is of especial impor- 
tance in the cases of weak, negative persons who have 
become so depleted in nerve force that they are not 
able to liberate and generate their own animal mag- 
netism in sufficient quantities.

Milk 

Milk is the one perfectly normal and therefore stand- 
ard food in Nature. It contains all the elements (page 
403) in exactly the right proportion which the new- 
bom and growing animal or infant needs for all the 
requirements of its rapidly developing body. These 
statements bring forth the question, ''Why then not 
live on milk entirely?" We have answered this ques- 
tion in "Nature Cure," and also outlined a milk and 
fruit diet which we have found most beneficial in our 
work. 

For the benefit of those who do not possess Volume 1 
of this series we will quote from the paragraphs under 
the subtitle **A Word About the Milk Diet," pages 285 
to 287 : 

"While milk is the natural food for the new-born 
and growing infant it is not natural for the adult. The 
digestive apparatus of the infant is especially adapted 
to the digestion of milk, while that of the adult re- 
quires more solid and bulky food. 

"Milk is a very beneficial article of diet in all acid 
diseases, because it contains comparatively low per- 
centages of carbohydrates and proteids and large 
amounts of organic salts. 

"However, not everybody can use milk as a food or 
medicine. In many instances it causes biliousness, fer- 
mentation and constipation. 

"In cases where it is easily digested, a straight milk 
diet often proves very beneficial. As a rule, however, 
it is better to take fruits or vegetable salads with the 
milk. 

' ' Directly with milk may be taken any sweetish, alka- 
line fruits, such as melons, sweet pears, etc., or the 



DAIRY PRODUCTS 301 

dried fruits, such as prunes, dates, figs and raisins, also 
vegetable salads. With the latter, if taken together 
with milk, little or no lemon juice should be used. 

**A11 acid and subacid fruits should be taken between 
the milk-meals. 

"A patient on a milk-diet may take from one to five 
quarts of milk daily, according to his capacity to digest 
it. This quantity may be distributed over the day after 
the following plan : 

"Breakfast: One to three pints of milk, sipped 
slowly, with any of the sweetisli, alkaline fruits men- 
tioned above, or with vegetable salads composed of let- 
tuce, celery, raw cabbage slaw, water cress, green 
onions, radishes, carrots, etc. 

"10 A. M. : Grape fruit, oranges, peaches, apples, 
apricots, berries, grapes, or other acid and subacid 
fruits. 

' ' Luncheon : The same as breakfast. 

"3 P. M. : The same as 10 A. M. 

* ' Supper : The same as breakfast. 

"An orange or apple may be taken before retiring. 

"When it is advisable to take a greater variety of 
food together with large quantities of milk, good whole 
grain bread and butter, cream, honey, cooked vege- 
tables, moderate amounts of potatoes and cereals may 
be added to the dietary. 

Buttermilk 

"Buttermilk is an excellent food for those with whom 
it agrees. In many instances a straight buttermilk diet 
for a certain period will prove very beneficial. This is 
especially true in all forms of uric acid diseases. ' * 



302 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

Sour Milk 

Sour milk or clabber also has excellent medicinal 
qualities, and may be taken freely by those with whom 
it agrees. Sour milk prepared in the following man- 
ner can be taken by many who cannot digest milk or 
buttermilk: Let the milk, with full cream, stand in a 
covered glass jar in the sun until it coagulates, but 
does not completely separate into curds and whey. Turn 
out into a bowl and whip with an egg beater until it is 
of a creamy consistency. Taken with a few dates this 
forms a most palatable and nourishing meal- 
Cream and Butter 

Cream and butter contain only the fat of the milk 
which rises to the top on account of its comparative 
lightness. The valuable protein materials and mineral 
salts remain in the skimmed milk. The latter is there- 
fore not to be despised for its food values. 

In fact its medicinal values are very much greater 
than that of cream or butter. We often find that our 
patients digest the skimmed milk much better than the 
full milk. Butter is not improved by the large amount 
of inorganic salt which it usually contains. The large 
amount of coloring matter is also often detrimental to 
health. The best butter from a hygienic standpoint 
is the sweet, unsalted and uncolored butter. 

Baby Feeding 

The practice of feeding babies on cream dilute with 
barley water mixed with inorganic mineral lime water, 
baking soda, milk sugar or table salt is positively harm- 
ful and preposterous in the face of the fact that human 
or cow's milk contains all the elements of nutrition in 



DAIRY PRODUCTS 303 

exactly the right proportion and the valuable mineral 
salts in the live-organic form in which nature intends 
them to serve as foods for animals and human beings. 
The cream and barley water are practically devoid of 
these all-important mineral elements, and the inorganic 
substitutes act more as poisons to the system than as 
wholesome foods. 

For the foregoing reasons good cow's milk is the 
only natural substitute for human milk. Our analyses 
show that the difference in composition between cow's 
milk and human milk is not enough to affect the infant. 
The danger lies not so much in overfeeding on **rich" 
cow's milk as in underfeeding on watered milk and 
cereal dilutions, and in poisoning the little body with 
inorganic minerals. 

If undiluted milk proves too rich, grain water may 
be added. In order to prepare this, take clean grain 
as it comes from the field, crush it in a new coffee mill, 
take 3 tablespoons of the crushed grain to one pint of 
cold water, heat and boil for one hour. "While the 
gruel is boiling, add enough water to allow for evapora- 
tion and absorption, then strain and add to milk 1 part 
of this grain water to 2 parts of milk. Change these 
proportions if necessary. 

When baby is constipated, add water from the oats 
and frequently cool the bowels with cold water. This 
will cure the most stubborn constipation. If the bowels 
are too loose, add water made from barley or wheat. 

Fruit juices and scraped raw apple are baby's finest 
medicines. They increase the supply of organic salts 
for blood, nerve and bone building and for purposes of 
elimination. 

During the first 2 months give one teaspoonful of 
orange juice, grape fruit juice or scraped apple one 



304 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

hour before or after each nursing. After the second 
month gradually increase the amounts of fruit. 

Cheese 

Cheese is a very concentrated food. If made from 
full milk it contains the protein, fat and sugar of the 
milk and if made from skimmed milk (cottage cheese) 
it contains only the protein, and sugar, but all kinds 
of cheese have been robbed of the larger part of the 
organic mineral salts which are extracted from the 
curds by the withdrawal of the whey. 

This makes cheese a very unbalanced food, too rich 
in the proteins, fats and sugars, and in proportion alto- 
gether too poor in the organic mineral salts. The com- 
pactness of the cheese interferes with its solubility and 
with the penetration of the digestive juices. Further- 
more, the casein has been rendered less digestible 
through the "cooking" of the cheese. This explains 
why cheese is a ''heavy" food, hard to digest and to 
assimilate and why for many people it is constipating. 

The processes of fermentation and decay which many 
kinds of cheeses undergo before they are ready for con- 
sumption are not at all appetizing or conducive to good 
health. 

Cottage cheese in these respects is far superior to the 
more expensive, highly spiced and fermented brands. 
It is more easily digested because it has not been sub- 
jected to the "cooking" process, and is not as sticky 
and compact. 

Cooking coagulates and solidifies the albumin of the 
milk in similar manner as the white of egg. All protein 
foods, including meats, are therefore rendered less 
digestible by cooking.

Many people when they give up the use of meat seem 
to think that they must eat a great many eggs in place 
of it. Others eat large quantities of peas, beans, cheese 
or other heavy, protein foods, in order to make good 
for the loss of the "nourishing" meat. 

This, however, is a mistake. It is just as easy to 
saturate the system with poisonous acids, alkaloids and 
albuminoids, by the excessive consumption of vegetable 
protein, as by meat-eating. Eggs also contain consid- 
erable quantities of uric acid, in the ready-made form. 
It is claimed about five grains to the pound. 

The white of egg is almost pure albumin, which is a 
form of protein material. The yolk contains large 
amounts of fats and various combinations of phos- 
phorus and sulphur. The two last named elements tend 
to create, during the process of digestion, considerable 
quantities of sulphurous acid, an ill-smelling gas, iden- 
tical with the ordinary sewer gas; also sulphuric acid, 
commonly called vitriol; phosphorus and phosphoric 
acid, all of which if they accumulate in the system may 
become very harmful or destructive to the organism. 

In view of these facts, it seems preposterous to stuff 
consumptives and other invalids, suffering from * * wast- 
ing" diseases, with enormous quantities of eggs, wTiich 
their weak digestions cannot digest, and which are 
bound to decay in their digestive organs and to fill the 

308 



EGGS 309 

system with poisonous acids, gases and alkaloids of 
putrefaction. These patients cannot properly digest 
and assimilate a few eggs a day, — if they did they 
would not waste away so rapidly. "What then is the 
use of overloading their weak digestive organs with 
enormous quantities of indigestible ballast. 

However, in moderate quantities, white of egg is a 
most valuable invalid food. "When the powers of diges- 
tion are at the lowest ebb, raw white of egg, fluid or 
beaten, with or without fruit juices, is usually more 
easily digested and assimilated than any other kind of 
food. 

Eggs are of great nutritive value when eaten raw, 
soft-boiled, or poached. Prolonged boiling or frying 
coagulates the albumin, making it hard and tough and 
therefore less digestible, 

EGGS 

Eggs should not be cooked in the usual way, by plac- 
ing them in boiling water; this hardens and toughens 
the albumen and makes them difficult to digest. A 
much better way is to place them in a good-sized ves- 
sel, pour boiling water over them until they are com- 
pletely submerged, cover them closely, and let them 
stand in the water five minutes or longer, according 
to whether they are desired soft, medium, or hard. If 
left in the water long enough, the yolk will become 
solid, but will still be tender and easily digested.

PART II 

A B C OF NATURAL DIETETICS 



CHAPTER I 

TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION 

Why We Favor a Vegetarian Diet 

We exclude from our dietary the flesh of dead ani- 
mals, because it doubles the work of our organs of 
elimination and overloads the system with animal waste 
matter and poisons. The following may serve to ex- 
plain this more fully : 

Two processes are constantly going on in every ani- 
mal organism: a building up and a tearing down 
process. The red blood carries into the body the various 
elements of nutrition and comes back laden with poi- 
sonous gases, broken-down cell material, and devital- 
ized food products. This debris is carried in the 
venous blood to the various organs of depuration and 
excreted in the form of feces, urine, mucus, perspira- 
tion, etc. Every drop of venous blood and every bit 
of animal flesh is contaminated with these poisonous 
excretions of the animal body — the feces of the cells. 
The meat-eater, therefore, has to eliminate, in addition 
to his own morbid waste products those of the animal 
carcass. 

Chemical analysis proves conclusively that uric acid 
and other uraemic poisons contained in the animal 
body are almost identical with caffein, thein and nico- 
tine, the poisonous stimulating principles of coffee, tea 
and tobacco. This puts flesh foods, meat soups and 
meat extracts in the same class with coffee, tea, alcohol, 
tobacco and other poisonous stimulants. It explains 

339 



840 NATURAL DIETETICS 

why meat stimulates the animal passions and why it 
creates a craving for liquor, tobacco and other stronger 
stimulants. 

Not long ago we saw a father in high glee at the 
sight of his little two-year-old baby boy chewing 
busily at a piece of rare beefsteak, the blood running 
from the corners of his mouth. Daddy related to me 
proudly that baby already liked his coffee as well as 
anybody else in the family. Imagine the tender, sensi- 
tive nervous system of the little child, from the cradle 
up, over-irritated with these powerful stimulants! 
Well-informed physicians tell us that a very large 
percentage of children acquire unnatural sexual habits 
before they leave the public schools. Is it any wonder ? 

It must also be taken into consideration that the 
morbid matter of the dead animal body is foreign and 
uncongenial to the excretory organs of man; in other 
words, that it is much harder for them to eliminate 
the waste matter of an animal carcass than that of the 
human body. 

Moreover, the formation of ptomains, or corpse poi- 
sons, begins immediately after the death of the animal. 
This is a serious matter, since meat and poultry is 
kept in refrigerators for many months and sometimes 
for years before it reaches the kitchen, green and livid 
looking, and sending forth suspicious odors which have 
to be doctored with chemicals and spices. 

The nobler among carnivorous animals devour only 
freshly slaughtered prey; it remains for scavengers of 
the hog and hyena type, and for man, to feast on flesh 
long cold and stark and tainted by the odors of in- 
cipient decay. 

The foregoing statements will explain why even the 
best of meats are detrimental to health, but the danger 



TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION 341 

becomes much greater when soup, roast, ham or sau- 
sage trace their origin to tuberculous or "lumpy-jaw" 
cattle, or to scrofulous or cholera-infected hogs. Raw 
meat is especially dangerous, because it is often the 
source of trichinae, tape-worms and other parasitic 
infections. 

The word scrofula is derived from the Latin word 
**scrofa" (sow), indicating that the ancients recog- 
nized the relationship between pork eating and scrofu- 
lous diseases. 

Even the artificial fattening processes to which the 
animals are subjected in order to increase their weight 
and consequent market value are fraught with deleteri- 
ous effects upon the meat products of their slaughter. 
It is a well recognized fact that, in most instances, a 
superabundance of flesh on the human animal is 
synonymous with systemic poisons and incipient dis- 
ease. Why should we expect better results from this 
unnatural and inhuman, though imquestionably * ' profit- 
able," stuffing treatment inflicted upon cattle, hogs, 
chickens, etc., just prior to their conversion into food 
for man? 

Still other powerful influences tend to poison the 
flesh of slaughtered animals. 

It is now well understood that emotions of worry, 
fear and anger actually poison blood and tissues. Fear 
and anger of the mother poison her milk and through 
the milk her nursing babe. The bite of an infuriated 
man has often proved as poisonous as that of a mad 
dog. All of us have experienced the poisonous and 
paralyzing effects of worry and fear. Animals are 
instinctively very sensitive to approaching danger and 
death. Fear is one of their predominating character- 
istics. 



342 NATURAL DIETETICS 

How excited they must be by emotions of worry, 
anger and fear, after many days of travel, closelj' 
packed in shaking cars — hungry, thirsty, tired, scared 
and angered to the point of madness ! Many die before 
the journey is ended ; others are driven, half dead with 
fear and exhaustion, to the slaughter pens, their in- 
stinctive fear of death augmented by the sight and 
odor of the bloody shambles. 

Think of the wounded deer and rabbit chased by 
hounds for many miles before death ends their agonies. 

Arguments of the Antis 

Arguments in favor of vegetarian diet are usually 
met with such brilliant objections and criticisms as, 
**Why did God create cows and hogs if they were not 
intended for us to eat?" To this thoughtful query 
we sometimes reply by asking the still deeper question, 
"Why did God create you if you are not to be eaten?" 
Others tell of the man who eats meat, smokes tobacco, 
drinks coffee and brandy, and is now four score years 
old and in perfect health. All are sure that our argu- 
ments are mere theories and that nobody can actually 
prove the truth of our statements. 

The fact that some people are so constituted that 
they can withstand the injurious effects of bad habits 
for many years does not imply that others can indulge 
with the same impunity ; that the hale and hearty ones 
would not be more hale and hearty without the poisons. 
Most of these rugged persons owe their iron constitu- 
tions to favorable heredity, simple, natural surroundings 
and frugal fare in early life. Most of them were reared 
* ' on the farm, ' ' or came from the European peasantry, 
who are practically vegetarians. Though these robust 



TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION 343 

ones may endure for a long time the weakening- influ- 
ences of * ' high living, ' ' their offspring have to pay the 
penalty in bad heredity. 

Careful observation discloses the interesting fact that 
the descendants of these hearty pioneers, when exposed 
to the degenerating influences of our city life, become 
extinct in the third, fourth or fifth generation. 

The most direct and positive proof that meat-eating 
is injurious to health and that it prevents the cure of 
serious chronic ailments, comes to us in everyday 
practice. 

Some years ago there came to us for treatment a 
woman whose head on one side was covered by a can- 
cerous mass of large proportions. Her troubles started 
two years earlier with an operation for the removal 
of a wen, "because it didn't look well." Neither she 
nor the learned surgeon, however, took into considera- 
tion that behind the wen lurked a constitutional psoric 
taint, in consequence of which the scar left by the 
operation soon became inflamed, opened and began to 
discharge pus. Four different times the wound was 
operated on, but in spite of antiseptics, cauterization, 
skin grafting and everything else the surgeons' skill 
could do, it would not ' ' stay healed. ' ' After the fourth 
operation the growth became so large and malignant 
that the surgeons were at the end of their wits. They 
said the growth had developed into a true cancer and 
dismissed the patient as incurable. 

In this state she came under our treatment, improved 
rapidly, and after five months of natural living and 
treatment, when scrofula and drug poisons were thor- 
oughly eliminated from her system, the grovsrth had 
disappeared and the wound was covered with healthy 
new skin. 



344 NATURAL DIETETICS 

Some time after this, however, she returned and re- 
ported that the wound had opened once more. On 
catechising her we found that — tempted by other mem- 
bers of the family — she had comineneed to eat meat. 
Following our strict advice she adhered more closely 
to her vegetarian regime, the wound immediately 
ceased to discharge, and healed once more. Several 
times after, she had the same experience. Whenever 
she partook of meat and coffee the wound would open 
and discharge. 

Another case which came under our treatment was 
that of a gentleman about thirty years of age. When 
we first attended him in his home he had been in bed 
with inflammatory rheumatism for five months. He 
was unable to use his limbs, and his friends had given 
up all hope of recovery. After four weeks of Nature 
Cure at home he was able to come for treatment to 
our sanitarium; two months later he was apparently 
a well man. There was only some inflammation and 
swelling in his right foot, which made walking very 
painful. For three months afterward, in spite of vigor- 
ous Nature Cure treatment, this painful lesion would 
not yield. Then we became convinced that something 
■was wrong. We told him that somehow he must be 
violating the law; if our treatment was good enough 
to cure the worst of his ailments, this comparatively 
insignificant symptom should also yield. 

''Well, doctor," he answered, "I am living up 
strictly to directions, but I have been taking a little 
meat now and then, and I smoke one or two pipes of 
tobacco a day. I thought this could not harm me." 

We explained to him that his system, under the 
influence of natural living, had become purified to 
such a degree that it was sensitive now to even small 



TWO Sn>ES TO EVERY QUESTION 345 

quantities of poison; that there was just enough 
uric acid and nicotine in the occasional piece of meat 
and pipe of tobacco to keep the weak part irritated 
and inflamed. He followed our directions more con- 
scientiously, and from that day the inflammation began 
to subside. "Within a few weeks it disappeared entirely. 

Still another phenomenon of common occurrence con- 
firms our opinion that meat-eating is neither natural 
nor necessary to man. People who have eaten meat 
regularly from childhood adopt and follow under our 
advice a strictly rational vegetarian diet. After sev- 
eral months of meatless regime they partake of some 
tempting roast or fowl and are very much surprised 
at the result of their experiment. They find that the 
tempting morsel does not taste as they anticipated. 
In many instances they experience unpleasant disturb- 
ances in the digestive organs, bad taste in the mouth, 
nausea, diarrhoea, and similar protests against un- 
natural food. 

One may cease eating bread, fruits or vegetables for 
many years, but when these foods are again taken 
there is never a sign of protest on Nature's part; on 
the contrary, they are relished more than ever. 

Persons who have broken and conquered the whis- 
key or tobacco habit have similar experiences. A glass 
of whiskey or a cigar taken after a long interval of 
total abstinence nauseates them as much as when they 
first began to drink or smoke. They have to learn it 
all over again. Complaints like the following are quite 
familiar : ' ' Why, doctor, this simple life is making me 
so weak that I cannot smoke a cigar without it turning 
my stomach inside out ; it makes me as sick as a green 
school-boy. ' ' 

These acute revulsions are not due to a weakening 



346 NATURAL DIETETICS 

of the system, but to the fact that the nervous organism 
is once more sensitive and strong enough to revolt 
against noxious poisons and to forcibly eliminate them. 
But, after repeated indulgence, the sensory nerves be- 
come so weakened that they can no longer protest, 
and our backslider is then once more "strong enough" 
to enjoj' his steak, smoke, coffee and liquor. 

What a glorious experience (for a while) this return 
to stimulants becomes ! The system, under the purify- 
ing and relaxing influences of natural living, has 
become so pure and sensitive that it fully responds to 
powerful stimulants. Our recreant friend feels so 
strong and buoyant that he "floats on air." He won- 
ders how he could have lived so long without these 
"wonderful tonics." By and by the scene changes. 
Brain and nerves become paralyzed under the continual 
action of nicotine, alcohol and uric acid. Morbid mat- 
ter accumulates and clogs the wheels of life. Bleary 
eyes, trembling hands, weak heart, rheumatic joints, 
fagged brain and irritable temper soon tell the result 
of "eating and drinking what agrees with you." The 
last of the backslider is worse than the first. Too 
often, weakened and discouraged by defeat, he lacks 
energy and moral courage to make another stand. 
Physical, mental and moral degeneration are the inev- 
itable results. 

Why We Sometimes Deviate from a Strictly Vegetarian 

Diet 

At different times I have expressed the opinion that 
under certain circumstances meat eating is advisable. 
This has been somewhat of a shock to those of our 
vegetarian friends who from the general trend of my 



TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION 347 

writings may have supposed that I was an out-and-out 
vegetarian. 

For about four years after I adopted the natural 
way of living I was indeed a Simon-pure vegetarian, 
and would not have recommended meat eating under 
any circumstances. The vegetarian regimen, together 
with the natural method of treatment, rescued me from 
seemingly incurable chronic diseases, and in the Ger- 
man Nature Cure sanitariums I had seen many others 
benefited in the same way. Enthusiasm over the re- 
covery of my health, and idealism, led me to believe 
that meat eating was invariably to be condemned. 

Gradually, however, certain instructions from a 
highly respected source, together with my own observa- 
tions in a daily practice which brought me into con- 
tact with all sorts and conditions of human ailments, 
caused me to change my opinions to some extent. 

What Are the Indications of Meat Requirement? 

In this country ninety per cent of sick people suffer 
from an excessive meat-and-egg diet. In India prob- 
ably the same percentage of sickness is caused by an 
excessive cereal diet. Both dietaries lack fruits and 
vegetables to counterbalance their acid producing 
tendencies. The American is positive and aggressive, 
the Hindoo negative and passive. The American suf- 
fers from uric acid and phosphoric acid poisoning, the 
Hindoo more from carbonic acid poisoning. 

Because in this country the great majority of people 
are uric acid poisoned we find it necessary to insist, in 
most cases that come to us for treatment, on a strictly 
vegetarian diet, usually including, however, the dairy 
products, in order to maintain the nervous equilibrium 
of the patients. 



348 NATURAL DIETETICS 

Individuals with a tendency to uric acid diseases are 
usually tense and positive in constitution and tempera- 
ment. They incline to be fleshy and florid, and belong 
to the bilious and sanguine temperaments. Before their 
peculiar diseases overtake them, they possess an over- 
abundance of animal spirits and sexuality. In char- 
acter they are aggressive, dominating and persevering. 
Among these we find successful business men, prom- 
inent lawyers and physicians, forceful politicians and 
great soldiers. 

At the opposite extremes from the tense, fleshy, uric- 
acid poisoned, apoplectic individual we find physically, 
the emaciated, flabby, anemic and consumptive, men- 
tally, the negative, apathetic and sensitive psychic. 

Between these opposites are found all grades and 
shades of physical and mental positivity and negativ- 
ity, tension and relaxation, aggressiveness and passive- 
ness. To give all these the same dietary treatment does 
not seem rational or advisable. 

Our friend, the raw food enthusiast, will say, **A 
strictly vegetarian diet, excluding even the dairy prod- 
ucts, will supply'in greatest abundance all the elements 
which constitute the human body." This may be per- 
fectly true, but food materials consist of something 
more than bare elements. The elements in their molec- 
ular combinations hold captive the life elements. As 
the molecule decomposes in the processes of digestion, 
these forces are liberated and supply energy to the 
body. The same combinations of elements in different 
food materials may hold in latency widely varying 
values of vibratory energy. A (C. 6. H.) combination 
in a molecule of animal matter may be possessed of 
much greater vibratory energy than a (C. 0. H.) com- 
bination in a vegetable molecule. The difference de- 



TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION 349 

pends on the nature of the life elements which animate 
the molecule. 

A physically negative individual may reach such 
a low stage of nerve depletion that it is impossible 
for him to muster the nerve force necessary for the 
elaboration of animal magnetism and highly organized 
nerve fats from vegetable foods. Flesh foods contain 
these nutritive values already prepared in the tissues 
of the animal, and therefore it may be of advantage to 
supply these in the ready-made form, at least tem- 
porarily, until the negative organism has stored up a 
sufficient supply of nerve force to carry on properly 
the work of digestion, assimilation and elaboration of 
vegetable food elements into the highly organized brain 
and nerve fats of the animal organism. Furthermore, 
great physical and mental depletion always means ex- 
treme relaxation of tissues; this also is counteracted 
by the tensing influence of the acid constituents of 
flesh foods. 

Physical and mental negativity do not always go 
together. A person may be physically positive and 
mentally negative and vice versa. Purely physical 
negativity seldom requires meat, but depletion of ani- 
mal magnetism and exhaustion of brain and nerve 
force usually do require it. In some cases the need of 
flesh food may be only temporary, in others it must 
be supplied permanently, in order to maintain a nor- 
mal amount of brain and nerve force. 

"We have cured hundreds of patients suffering from 
wasting diseases without allowing them an ounce of 
meat. Consumption, chronic indigestion and mal- 
assimilation are in most cases caused by the various 
forms of acid poisoning and are therefore only aggra- 
vated by an increase in proteid and carbohydrate 



350 NATURAL DIETETICS 

foods. The consumptive, wasting away from carbonic 
acid poisoning, needs more sodium to eliminate the 
coal gas from his system, and more iron to supply him 
with oxygen, and these elements can be furnished in 
the greatest abundance and in best possible combina- 
tions in milk, fruits and green vegetables. 

In some cases, however, where loss of flesh and phys- 
ical weakness are accompanied by great exhaustion of 
nerve force, I find the addition of meat to the dietary 
very beneficial. We have cured, on a vegetarian diet, 
many patients suffering from seemingly incurable wast- 
ing diseases, when there was loss of flesh and extreme 
weakness. Naturally they became enthusiastic vege- 
tarians. Some of these friends, against our advice, 
discarded even the dairy products and others lived on 
a strictly fruit and nut diet. "With the exception of a 
few, who possessed good constitutions of the positive 
animal type, these extremists sooner or later developed 
signs of physical and mental weakness and negativity. 
In many instances there resulted a loss of flesh and 
strength, accompanied by weakening of brain and 
nerve force. In other instances physical conditions 
remained satisfactory but there resulted decided weak- 
ening of mental energy and nerve force. 

At one time I received a letter from a former patient, 
who, on a vegetarian diet, had made a splendid recov- 
erj'- from chronic indigestion, constipation and nerv- 
ousness. For over three years he adhered faithfully 
to the vegetarian regimen and had not eaten a piece of 
meat. He reported that physically he was in fine con- 
dition and normal in weight, but that lately he had 
developed peculiar mental and nervous symptoms. 

He wrote, '*I am developing something like the sleep- 
ing sickness; I am losing my mental energy; I go to 



TWO SIDES TO EVERY QUESTION 351 

sleep over my work in the daytime ; when I come home 
in the evening I do not feel like reading or exerting 
myself in any way, physically or mentally. I am losing 
all ambition, nothing interests me, it seems to me that 
something is pressing upon my eye-lids and keeping 
them closed. While the sleepiness lasts it takes all my 
strength. These spells last for three or four hours at a 
stretch; they come every day and last longer each 
time; have passages two or three times a day; use 
vegetable foods only and am very fond of them, etc." 

I advised him as follows: "You have gone into 
the extreme of a vegetarian diet; you have neglected 
too long the dairy products and your reserve brain 
and nerve force have become depleted; eat meat once 
a day, together with plenty of raw fruits and vegeta- 
bles, and take a salt rub, morning and evening. Report 
results. ' ' 

Within a week he wrote to me, "Within the past 
few days I have not had any sleepiness and I am 
mighty glad of it. The bad taste in my mouth has 
disappeared, but my tongue is still slightly coated. I 
feel considerably stronger. I eat meat once a day, but 
cannot say that I relish it. For three years I have 
been eating nothing but vegetables, fruits, nuts and 
home-made whole wheat bread. The meat tastes to 
me like old rotten wood, and causes me to be some- 
what constipated (tensing effect). 

**I think there is nothing like the vegetarian diet. 
I have not lost a pound of flesh, bowels move right 
along, twice or three times a day (note relaxing effect 
of vegetables). The worms have entirely disap- 
peared." 

In this case the vegetarian diet evidently furnished 
a sufficient amount of blood and tissue building ele- 



352 NATURAL DIETETICS 

ments, but not enough brain and nerve force. The 
man has continued to improve on the mixed diet. I 
believe from now on a liberal percentage of the dairy 
products in his daily dietary, together with uncooked 
fruits and vegetables, will be sufficient to maintain his 
nervous equilibrium. 

Another interesting case is that of a young lady, 
who came to us two years ago in the advanced stages 
of consumption. Under the influence of our natural 
treatment and a rational vegetarian diet she made a 
splendid recovery. All symptoms of the dread disease 
gradually disappeared and she gained somewhat in 
weight, A year after she began the treatment she 
came to me for consultation, saying, "Doctor, I feel 
good in every way, but I am losing in weight, and some- 
what in strength; what would you advise me to do?" 

I answered, "While the vegetarian diet served its 
purpose in purifying your system of scrofulous and 
tuberculous taints, it has failed in the long run to 
supply you with sufficient nerve force and animal 
magnetism; consequently, the processes of digestion 
and assimilation begin to suffer, resulting in loss in 
flesh and strength. For a while eat meat once a day 
and watch results." She had become so enthusiastic 
over the vegetarian diet that she was loath to follow 
my advice. 

Several times she came back to me with the same 
complaints, but she could not make up her mind to 
take the meat until her weight had decreased from 
96 pounds to 80. Then she became sufficiently 
alarmed to follow my advice and ate meat three or 
four times a week. She has done this now for about 
three months and has gained eighteen pounds, two 
pounds more than her highest weight during the last 



TWO SroES TO EVERY QUESTION 353 

two years. She has regained her rosy complexion, 
her eyes sparkle with new life and she is much stronger 
physically and mentally. She is naturally of the ex- 
tremely negative, sensitive type, and may have to con- 
tinue to eat meat occasionally in order to keep herself 
in normal condition. 

In view of this convincing evidence, my vegetarian 
friends and enthusiasts will understand why, although 
for years I was loath to admit it, I have come now to 
the conclusion that in certain cases meat is not only 
advisable, but indispensable to the maintenance of 
mental and physical equilibrium. 

The results of my own experiments with a mixed 
meat and vegetable diet on certain types of patients 
have been such that I should feel guilty if, in such 
cases, I were to refrain from prescribing it on account 
of idealistic scruples. 

"Wherever the vitality has been greatly lowered 
through heredity, abnormal habits of living, suppres- 
sive treatment of diseases, physical over-strain and 
mental worry, it is necessary to supplement the daily 
dietary with dairy products, and in some instances, 
at least temporarily, with flesh foods. 

A healthy, vigorous, positive organism is at all times 
capable of elaborating from the products of the vege- 
table kingdom all the tissues, fuel materials and 
electro-magnetic energies of the human body. But 
owing to unnatural habits of living and suppression 
of diseases for many ages past, there are but few such 
lucky individuals. It will require several generations 
of natural living and more congenial social surround- 
ings to prpduce the perfect human type, capable of 
living a perfectly natural life. 

As under better social conditions and surroundings 



354 NATURAL DIETETICS 

the strain and drain on the vital energies is lessened, 
there will be less demand for the animal magnetism 
of dairy products and flesh foods, and the brutalizing 
customs of butchering animaU and of meat-eating will 
become a thing of the past. 

Only a few generations ago the manufacture and 
use of alcoholic beverages was looked on as perfectly 
legitimate and honorable. Today both have fallen 
into disrepute. The time is fast approaching when 
meat-eating will be considered as degrading as the 
driak habit. 

In past ages man had little choice in the selection 
of his food. He was forced to live on that which was 
available and convenient, like the products of the hunt 
and the herds. Now, that railroads and steamships 
bring to our doors the fruits, nuts, grains and vegeta- 
bles of the most distant regions of the earth, rational 
food selection has become a possibility, and with this 
humanity is beginning to sense the uncleanliness of 
meat eating. Natural Dietetics, better social conditions 
and finer sensibilities will combine to make it obso- 
lete. 



CHAPTER n 

IS IT WORTH WHILE TO PAY ATTENTION 
TO DIET? 

Forethought in food selection and combination is 
indispensable for the restoration and preservation of 
health, but fearthought at the table will poison the 
most wholesome food and drink. As in everything 
else, it is well to avoid extremes and to stick to the 
common-sense middle-way. Many of our modern meta- 
physicians seem to think that by a sort of mental 
alchemy they can transmute the elements in their bodies 
or create them out of nothingness. 

Divine healers say to us, "Eat and drink what you 
please ; pray ; the Lord will make it all right. ' ' The 
Christian Scientist says, "Dietetics is a snare and a 
delusion. Foods cannot harm you so long as you do 
not think they can." 

I doubt whether the Lord has the time or the incli- 
nation to make good continually the bad results of 
wrong eating, over-feeding, and food poisoning. 
Neither is the advice of the doctor and the "Scientist," 
"Eat what agrees with you," in keeping with the dic- 
tates of common sense, or with the findings of science. 

No matter what we try to produce, whether it be an 
apple pie, a picture, a locomotive, or a phonograph, we 
all know that in the making of these or any other 
things we require certain materials in certain well- 
defined proportions. 

But how many people apply this self-evident prin- 
ciple in the management of their bodies? 

355 



356 NATURAL DIETETICS 

The wonderfully constructed human machine is also 
composed of certain materials in well-defined propor- 
tions, of which, so far, seventeen have been discovered 
by chemical science. If any of these are present in 
over-abundance, and others are deficient or wholly 
lacking, there will surely result abnormal structure 
and functions, in other words: disease. 

The normal composition of vital fluids and tissues 
depends upon the food and drink that is taken into 
the system. Therefore, the elements of nutrition must 
be provided in right proportions in order to supply 
the needs of the body. 

But is it not a fact that most people pay no attention 
whatever to these obvious truths? They take into 
their long-sutYering stomachs any odd combinations of 
food materials without the slightest consideration as 
to whether they ■\\dll meet the manifold requirements 
of the human organism. 

The only question in the selection of food seems to 
be, "Does it taste good?" Then people wonder why 
they are afflicted with dyspepsia, chronic constipation, 
appendicitis, cancer, and the multitude of other ail- 
ments resulting from mal-nutrition and auto-intoxica- 
tion. 

The majority of medical practitioners do not seem 
to know any more about the principles of natural 
dietetics than the laity. Their advice on diet runs 
about as follows: "Do not pay any attention to food 
faddists — there is no exact science of dietetics — what 
is one man's food is another man's poison — eat what 
agrees with you — take plenty of good, nourishing food 
— the only safe guide in food selection is appetite and 
instinct," etc. 

Such is the wisdom dispensed by certain popular 



IS IT WORTH WHILE TO PAY ATTENTION TO DIET! 357 

writers on hygiene and dietetics, who, blessed with 
more conceit than scientific knowledge, ridicule the 
idea and deny the possibility of an exact science of 
dietetics. 

"Eat what agrees with you." If this be good and 
true advice, then caffeine must be good for the coffee 
toper, nicotine for the smoker, alcohol for the drunk- 
ard, and morphine, cocaine, opium, etc., for the dope 
fiend. For these poisons seem to "agree" exceeding 
well with the people habitually addicted to their use. 
If suddenly deprived of their favorite stimulants or 
narcotics, they suffer great distress, become very ill, 
and may even die as the result of such deprivation. 

These are the people who say, "I never eat fruits 
and vegetables. They taste flat, they do not agree 
with me, they actually sicken me." 

This would seem to indicate that for the majority 
of human beings, taste, appetite and cravings are not 
safe guides. The following explains why this is so: 

The animal, living in freedom, is guided in the selec- 
tion of its food as well as in all its other life habits 
by instinct, that is, by the wisdom of Mother Nature. 
Therefore, the animal acts in accordance with the laws 
of its being and, as a result of this, possesses perfect 
health, strength and beauty, preserves its faculties, 
capacities and powers almost to the very end of its 
life, and then dies an easy, painless, "natural" death. 

Guided by Nature, the animal selects and partakes 
of only those foods which are best suited to its par- 
ticular constitution. The lion does not eat grass, nor 
does the cow devour the bleeding carcass of a lamb. 
Each animal adheres to a limited combination of foods 
best adapted to its individual needs. 

The only exceptions to this are a few onmivoroufl 



358 NATURAL DIETETICS 

scavengers, such as the hyena, vulture, hog, and 
chicken, for which nothing seems too vile to swallow. 
The nobler carnivorous animals, as the lion, tiger, 
leopard, etc., live only on freshly-killed meat. They 
would not touch the carcass of a dead and decaying 
animal. 

In the course of evolutionary -development, Man has 
lost the animal instinct and therewith the faculty for 
"natural" food selection. Keason, which took the 
place of instinct, was, in the past, not enlightened 
enough to be a trustworthy guide in regulating his life 
habits. Instead of following the dictates of reason, 
Man catered to his perverted appetites. 

In order to produce artificial stimulation, he learned 
to use spices and condiments, to convert wholesome 
grains and delicious grapes into alcohol. He became 
addicted to the use of the poisonous xanthins and alka- 
loids of coffee, tea, tobacco, and narcotic drugs. 

Such artificial stimulation of the taste buds in the 
tongue and of the sensory nerves inevitably results 
in gradual atrophy and loss of their natural sensi- 
tiveness, and this calls for still stronger stimulants to 
"tickle" the paralyzed nerves and the no-longer-sensi- 
tive palate. 

It is for these reasons that people addicted to the 
use of spices, condiments, stimulants and narcotics 
have lost the capacity for "sensing" and enjoying the 
most delicate aromas and flavors of fruits and vege- 
tables. 

This brings us to the question : % 

WHAT IS NATURAL POOD? 

We have endeavored to define this term as follows: 
"•'Natural' food for animal and Man is that food 



IS IT WORTH WHILE TO PAY ATTENTION TO DIET? 359 

which appeals to the senses of sight, taste and smell in 
the natural condition, as it comes from Nature's 
hands." Any food which needs disguising by cooking, 
spicing, pickling, etc., is not "natural." 

For instance, fruits, berries, nuts, vegetables, and 
grains can be eaten with relish in the uncooked state 
by healthy, normal individuals. This is true even of 
raw potatoes, carrots, beets a-nd other roots which are 
enjoyed and perfectly digested by healthy children. 

On the other hand, raw meat, uncooked and unspiced, 
is revolting to the sensory organs. Before it can be 
relished, the taste and smell of the corpse must be 
disguised by boiling, roasting, and much spicing. 

People who have been heavy meat-eaters all their 
lives, after living on a vegetarian diet for a few 
months, frequently acquire a strong dislike for the odor 
of raw meat and even for the taste and odor of cooked 
meat. This is not true in the case of grain, roots, 
fruits and vegetables. The longer a person is forced 
to abstain from these, the more they are relished. 

In making the foregoing statements, it is not our 
intention to convert our readers to strict vegetari- 
anism. But as we proceed in our discussions we shall 
endeavor to point out the advantages and disadvan- 
tages of different foods and food combinations. The 
reader can then form his own conclusions and put the 
theories here presented to the test of practical experi- 
ence. 

Someone might say, "The study of food chemistry 
and scientific dietetics is too difficult for the ordinary 
individual. We have to leave these things to the 
doctors." 

This is a mistake. Nature Cure has reduced the 
teachings concerning the art and science of Natural 



360 NATURAL DIETETICS 

Dietetics to such simplicity that they can be compre- 
hended and applied by anyone endowed \^^th ordinary 
intelligence. The quest after a normal, natural diet 
is not so silly and impossible as some people would 
make you believe. 

Starving America 

"Starving America" is the title of a very instruc- 
tive, recently published book on food chemistry and 
food poisoning, by Alfred W. McCann. 

This publication shows how rapidly the teachings 
of Nature Cure are spreading in this country. All 
the important arguments and statements of the author 
dealing with food chemistry were fully treated in my 
articles on "Natural Dietetics" in the Nature Cure 
Magazines, Vol. 1907-1909, the most important of which 
are incorporated in the subject matter of this volume. 

"Starving America." It sounds rather strange. Is 
it possible that this glorious country of ours, blessed 
more abundantly by Mother Nature than any other, 
the richest on God's footstool, can be starving amidst 
a plethora of all that human beings need to live and 
thrive on in comfort and in luxury (provided its prod- 
ucts were justly distributed) ? 

Yes, it is not only possible, but an actual fact that 
America is starving amidst plenty ; not only its inhabi- 
tants, but in many localities the soil as well. What 
is strangest of all, those who have the greatest abund- 
ance in lands and money are starving just as much, 
and possibly more, than the underpaid and overworked 
wage-earner. In many instances, the wealthy are worse 
off than the poor, Decause they are not only starved, 
but also poisoned by their over-abundance of food and 
of leisure. 



IS IT WORTH WHILE TO PAY ATTENTION TO DIET? 361 

You ask, "What is the meaning of all this non- 
sense?" It is this: The people of America have been 
overfed with starches, sugars, fats, and nitrogenous 
foods (meat, eggs and glutens), but starved from lack 
of the all-important mineral elements, — the organic 
salts, — on which depend absolutely the normal struc- 
ture and functions of the body, or physical and mental 
health. 

The public in general, as well as the medical schools, 
have been ignorant on the subject of true food values 
and of true food chemistry. Doctors and laymen have 
labored under the mistaken idea that the only foods 
worth considering on account of their nutritious value 
are the starches, sugars, fats and proteins. The most 
recent works on dietetics, used in our best medical 
schools, take into consideration these foods only. They 
have nothing to say on the importance of the mineral 
elements in the economy of the human body. 

As yet it has not become generally known that cer- 
tain alkaline mineral elements, though present only 
in minute quantities in foods and in animal and human 
bodies, are essential to life and health. If these 
"tissue salts" are lacking in the food, and if, as a 
result of this, they are deficient in the body, disease 
is bound to arise; and in this event, overfeeding on 
the "nourishing" starches, sugars, fats and proteins 
will only serve to make matters worse. 

These statements are, of course, contrary to popular 
notions and to the pseudo-scientific teachings of the 
schools. They say, "If a person be weak, sickly and 
emaciated, stuff him with plenty of rich, nourishing 
food." This is held to be good and common-sense 
practice ; but what is the usual result ? The ' ' stuffed ' ' 
anemic grows stiU weaker and thinner, and the ' ' stuff- 



362 NATUEAL DIETETICS 

ing" of the consumptive serves only to make his con- 
dition more hopeless. The very abundance of meat and 
eggs, which is supposed to build up these patients, 
poisons their system beyond the possibility of recovery. 

To be sure, starches, sugars, fats and proteins meet 
certain demands and fill very important functions in 
the economy of the body, but, on the other hand, they 
produce in the processes of digestion large amounts of 
poisonous acids, alkaloids, gases and ptomaines. 

To these morbid by-products of digestion are added 
the excretions or feces of the cells. Furthermore, the 
cells and tissues of the body are constantly changing, 
building up and breaking down, just like the body as 
a whole. The broken-down tissue-materials also create 
large quantities of morbid matter and poisons. Prac- 
tically all diseases arising in the human organism are 
caused originally by the accumulation of these effete 
waste and end products of digestion and of the tissue 
changes. 

Therefore, in order to insure normal structure and 
functions, in other words, "good health," these waste 
products must be neutralized and eliminated from the 
system as promptly and as completely as possible. This, 
in turn, depends upon an abundant supply in blood 
and tissues of the alkaline mineral elements, also called 
nutritious salts or tissue salts, the most important of 
which are iron, sodium, lime, lithia, magnesium, potas- 
sium and silicon. 

These mineral elements are found in all the impor- 
tant secretions of the body. Upon them depends the 
"richness" of the blood and the solidity of the fleshy 
and bony structures. They are the building stones of 
the physical organism. 

The science of biochemistry deals with the function! 



IS IT WORTH WHILE TO PAY ATTENTION TO DIET? 363 

of these mineral salts in the life-activities of the ascend- 
ing kingdoms of Nature : the mineral, the vegetable, the 
animal, and the human. Upon this science is based 
rational soil feeding as well as the biochemic treatment 
of diseases by means of tissue salts, vitochemical, 
homeopathic, and herb remedies. Natural diet or 
rational vegetarianism is based, also, upon this strictly 
scientific foundation. The medicinal values of the 
natural foods and remedies depend upon their richness 
in the positive mineral elements. 

The foregoing explains why our American people are 
starving in the midst of plenty. Their ''highly nutri- 
tious" and *' luxurious" meat-potato-white-bread-cof 
fee-and-pie diet contains an overabundance of th( 
poison-producing, negative food elements of the firsi 
four groups (see pages 385a and 385b), but it is alto- 
gether deficient in the positive, alkaline, mineral ele- 
ments of the fifth group. 



CHAPTER III 
FOR WHAT DO WE EAT AND DRINK? 

The majority of people would reply, "Why, every- 
body knows thp.t ! From food and drink we derive our 
strength. ' ' 

Are you so sure of this? Do you really believe that 
the large amount of animal heat and vital energy which 
the human body manufactures, radiates, and expends 
every twenty-four hours is derived from the few 
pounds of food consumed in the course of a day? 

Any hard-working laborer or athlete spends in 
energy the equivalent of several horsepowers of steam 
a day. A healthy individual may continue to do this 
for several weeks without taking any food whatever. 

This has been proved by our fasting faddists. Many 
of these "Marathon" f asters have kept up their regu- 
lar occupations for forty days or longer at a time with- 
out showing any considerable diminishing of strength 
and without the slightest difference in body tempera- 
ture. 

It may be argued that this expenditure of animal 
heat and vital energy during a fast takes place at the 
expense of the tissues of the body, which are consumed 
in place of food. However, the average loss in weight 
during a strict fast does not amount to more than about 
one pound a day. How can one pound of flesh furnish 
the fuel material necessary to supply the enormous 
amount of animal heat and vital energy produced and 

364 



FOB WHAT DO WE EAT AND DRINK? 365 

used by the body in twenty-four hours? Then, also, 
it has been proved that in the performance of muscle 
labor and production of animal heat the tissues of the 
body are not consumed but only the nutriment stored 
in the blood, the cells and the muscle fibres. 

To cite from personal observation: One of our 
patients suffering from typhoid malaria did not take 
any food except water for seven weeks. At the end 
of that time his body temperature was normal. Dur- 
ing the last two weeks of the fast he lost only two 
pounds. 

Another patient afflicted with cancer of the stomach 
lived for two years on a few ounces of food daily. His 
temperature was normal almost to the last. 

Whether sweltering under the tropical sun of the 
equator or freezing with arctic cold, the temperature 
of the body is exactly the same. If it drop or rise a 
few degrees below or above the normal, death ensues. 

This regulation of the bodily heat, regardless of the 
surrounding temperature, and, Avithin certain limits, 
regardless of the quantity and quality of food con- 
sumed, is one of the greatest mysteries of the wonderful 
human organism. 

These considerations force us to the conclusion that 
there must be another source of heat and energy be- 
sides food. This is indeed the case. 

In order to understand the relationship of food to 
vital energy, we must first endeavor to get a clearer 
understanding of the true nature of "strength," ''vital 
force," and of "life" itself. 

In "Nature Cure, Philosophy and Practice" I have 
given the following definitions of vital force from two 
radically opposed viewpoints : 

"There are two prevalent, but widely differing con- 



866 NATURAL DIETETICS 

ceptions of the nature of LIFE or VITAL FORCE : the 
material and the vital. 

"The former looks upon life or vital force with all 
its physical, mental, and psychical phenomena as mani- 
festations of the electric, magnetic, and chemical activ- 
ities of the physical-material elements composing the 
human organism. From this point of view, life is a 
sort of 'spontaneous combustion,' or, as one scientist 
expressed it, a 'succession of fermentations.' 

"This materialistic conception of life, however, has 
already become obsolete among the more advanced 
biologists as a result of the wonderful discoveries of 
modern science, which are fast bridging the chasm be-' 
tween the material and the spiritual realms of being. 

"But medical science as taught in the regular schools 
is still dominated by the old, crude, mechanical con- 
ception of vital force and this, as we shall see, accounts 
for some of its gravest errors of theory and of practice. 

"The vital conception, on the other hand, regards 
life as the primary force of all forces, coming from the 
great central source of all power. 

"This force, which permeates, heats and animates 
the entire created universe, is the expression of the 
divine will, the 'logos,' the 'word' of the Great Creative 
Intelligence. It is this divine energy which sets in 
motion the whirls of the ether, the electric corpuscles 
and ions, that make up the different atoms and ele- 
ments of matter. 

"These corpuscles and ions of which the atoms are 
composed are positive and negative forms of electricity. 
Electricity is a form of energy. It is intelligent energy ; 
otherwise it could not move with that same wonderful 
precision in the electrons of the atoms as in the suns 
and planets of the sidereal universe. 



FOR WHAT DO WE EAT AND DRINK? 367 

"This intelligent energy can have but one source: 
the will and the intelligence of the Creator, as Sweden- 
borg expressed it, 'the great central sun of the uni- 
verse.' 

"If this supreme intelligence should withdraw its 
energy then the electrons and ions (electrical charges), 
and with them the atoms, elements, — the entire material 
universe — would disappear in the flash of a moment. 

"From this it appears that crude matter, instead of 
being the source of life and of all its complicated men- 
tal and spiritual phenomena (which assumption, on 
the face of it, is absurd), is only an expression of the 
Life Force, itself a manifestation of the Great Creative 
Intelligence which some call God, others Nature, the 
Oversoul, Brahma, Prana, etc. — each according to his 
best understanding. 

"It is this supreme power and intelligence, acting 
in and through every atom, molecule and cell in the 
human body, which is the true healer, the 'vis medica- 
trix naturae, ' which always endeavors to repair, to heal, 
and to restore the perfect type. All that the physician 
can do is to remove obstructions and to establish nor- 
mal conditions within and around the patient, so that 
'the healer within' can do his work to the best advan- 
tage." 

This life force is the primary source of all energy, 
from which aU other kinds and forms of energy are 
derived. It is as independent of the body and of food 
and drink as the electric current is independent of the 
glass bulb and the carbon thread through which it 
manifests as heat and light. The breaking of the in- 
candescent bulb, though it extinguishes the light, does 
not in any way diminish the amount of electricity 
back of it. 



368 NATURAL DIETETICS 

In similar manner, if the physical body should "fall 
dead," as we call it, the vital energy keeps on acting 
with undiminished force through the spiritual-material 
body, which is an exact duplicate of the physical 
body, but whose material atoms and molecules are 
infinitely more refined and vibrate at infinitely greater 
velocities than those of the physical-material body. 

This is not merely a matter of faith or of speculative 
reasoning, but a demonstrated fact of Natural Science. 

When St. Paul said (1 Cor. 15:44): "There is a 
natural (pliysical) body, and there is a spiritual body," 
he stated an actual fact in Nature. 

Indeed, it would be impossible to conceive of the 
survival of the individuality after death without a 
material body which serves as the vehicle for conscious- 
ness, memory, and the reasoning faculties, and as an 
instrument for the physical functions. Without a body, 
it would be impossible for the soul to manifest itself 
to other souls or to communicate with them. 

Therefore, if survival of the individuality after death 
be a fact in Nature, and if the achievement of immor- 
tality be a possibility, a spiritual-material body is a 
necessity. 

Some one may say, "If the life force is independent 
of the physical body and of food and drink, why do we 
have to eat and drink to keep alive?" 

The answer to this is : Food and drink are necessary 
to keep the organism in the right condition, so that 
vital force can manifest and operate through it to the 
best advantage. To this end food is needed to build up 
and to repair the tissues of the body. It also serves 
to a certain extent as fuel material, which is trans- 
muted into animal heat and vital energy. 

It is true that during the processes of digestion and 



FOB WHAT DO WE EAT AND DRINK? 369 

combustion (breaking down of food materials), a cer- 
tain amount of animal heat and vital energy is liber- 
ated; but, as we pointed out in the foregoing para- 
graphs, this does not account for all the animal heat 
and vital energy expended. 

Furthermore, just as coal has to come in touch with 
fire before it can be transmuted into heat, so the life 
force is needed to "burn up" or "to explode" the fuel 
materials. When "life" has departed, even large 
amounts of sugars, fats, proteins, tonics and stimulants 
are not able to produce one spark of vital energy in 
the body. 

On the contrary, digestion, assimilation and elimina- 
tion of food and drink require the expenditure of con- 
siderable amounts of vital energy. Therefore all food 
taken in excess of the actual needs of the body wastes 
vital force instead of giving it. 

If these facts were more generally known and appre- 
ciated people would not habitually overeat under the 
mistaken idea that their vitality increases in proportion 
to the amount of food they consume; neither would 
they believe that they can derive "strength" from 
poisonous stimulants and tonics. They would not be 
so much afraid of fasting. They would understand 
better the necessity of fasting in acute diseases and 
"healing crises," and avail themselves more frequently 
of this most effective means of purification. They 
would no longer believe themselves in danger of dying 
if they were to miss a few meals. 

So far we have answered the question, "For what 
do we eat and drink," in the negative Now we shall 
study the real functions of food and drink in the 
economy of the body. 



CHAPTER IV 

THE FUNCTIONS OF FOOD AND DRINK IN THE 
ECONOMY OF THE BODY 

Food and drink perform the following functions in 
the vital processes of the body: 

(1) They furnish the necessary amount of water 
in order to hold in solution the constituent elements of 
the body and to make possible the circulation of the 
vital fluids and the elimination of waste and morbid 
matter. 

(2) They supply bulk in the form of cellulose and 
woody fibre, which offer solid resistance to the intes- 
tines, thereby stimulating the peristaltic movements 
of the bowels and acting as scourers, purifiers and laxa- 
tives. 

(3) They provide fuel materials. 

(4) They provide materials for the building and re- 
pair of the tissues of the hody. 

(5) They supply the positive, mineral salts, which 
are important as building materials, neutralizers, and 
eliminators of poisonous acids, alkaloids and ptomaines, 
and essential to the production and distribution (con- 
ductors) of the electro-magnetic energies in the system. 

We shall now consider separately these various func- 
tions of food materials in the economy of the body in 
connection with our classification of foods. 

370 



THE FUNCTIONS OP FOOD AND DRINK 371 

GROUP I. (St.) (C.O.H.) Starches. GROUP U. (S.) 
(C.O.H.) Sugars and Dextriues 

The foods belonging to these two groups are called 
carbohydrates, because their essential elements are 
carbon and hydrogen. When chemically pure they are 
composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen 
and hydrogen occur in proportions which form water 
(H2O). These foods are to the human body what the 
fuel is to the furnace : they are producers of heat and 
energy. Through the processes of digestion the starches 
are changed into dextrines and sugars, and absorbed 
in the digestive tract. They can enter the circulation 
of the blood, through the cell linings of the intestines, 
only in the forms of dextrose and glucose. These sub- 
stances are burned up in the tissues of the body and 
help to produce animal heat, muscular and other forms 
of energy. 

"We say "help to produce" advisedly, because prac- 
tically all writers on food chemistry, including those 
of the Nature Cure School, claim that sun heat and 
energy, latent in carbonaceous foods, is the only source 
of heat and energy in animal and human bodies. 

This, however, as we have pointed out in another 
chapter, is a great mistake which has led to many false 
conclusions and harmful practices, — especially to over- 
eating and the taking of poisonous stimulants and 
tonics, under the mistaken idea that vital energy can 
be increased in that way. The fallacy of this concep- 
tion of the source of animal heat and energy we have 
already explained under the caption, "For what do we 
eat and drink?" 

In order to understand this all-important problem 
more fully let us study for a moment what combus- 



372 NATUILVL DIETETICS 

tion is: The processes of "burning," "combustion," 
"fermentation," "digestion," "rusting," "decaying," 
"putrefying," etc., are similar in nature. They are 
all processes of oxidation. They dijffer only in rapidity 
of action. They all represent the breaking down of 
complex materials into simpler forms, through the com- 
bination of the oxygen in the air with the carbon in 
the "oxidizing" materials. This disintegration is ac- 
companied by the chemical combination of the oxygen 
of the air with the carbon, the iron, or some other ele- 
ment of the burning, fermenting, putrefying, or rusting 
substance. During these processes of disintegration, 
the carbon recombines with the oxygen of the air 
(combustion) and the latent life energy and sun heat 
are liberated and furnish heat, light and other forms 
of energy. 

The Sources of Animal Heat 

A man may eat in the right proportions all the seven- 
teen chemical elements found in his body. He may also 
take a sufficient amount of air and water. Yet he will 
surely die. In fact, some of these elements, instead 
of nourishing him, -will act on him as poisons. Experi- 
ments carried on by German food scientists have demon- 
strated that even some of the proximate food elements, 
when chemically pure, will not sustain animal or human 
life. Animals fed on chemicallj'' pure starch or white 
sugar die sooner than those which receive no food at all. 

This clearly indicates that not the various chemical 
elements found in food and drink, in and by them- 
selves create animal heat and sustain animal and human 
life, but that life, heat and energy depend on some- 
thing more than these. 

What is this mysterious something which builds up 



THE FUNCTIONS OP FOOD AND DRINK 373 

and sustains vegetable, animal and human bodies ? The 
majority of scientists assume that the sun supplies all 
heat and energy on our planet; that sun light and sim 
heat are the only sources of vegetable and animal 
energy. 

The fallacy of their reasoning is due to the fact that 
the forces and energies latent in and proceeding from 
the sun are not by any means the highest expressions 
of life or vital force on this planet. That which we 
call "life," which animates the entire created universe, 
is the primary source of all forces and all energies. 
Sun energy is merely a manifestation of this primary 
force of all forces, which manifests with increasing 
potency in the ascending kingdoms of Nature. 

This primary Life Force or Vital Force manifests 
in the mineral kingdom as the electro-magnetic life 
element, in the vegetable kingdom as the vito-chemical 
life element, in the animal kingdom as the spiritual 
life element, and in the human kingdom as the soul life 
element. These life elements, in conjunction with the 
light and heat (radio active forces) of the sun, elab- 
orate the elements of the earth and air into the ascend- 
ing forms of the four kingdoms of Nature. 

In other words, life or vital force is the builder, 
while sun energy is only one of the building materials ; 
life force is primary, sun energy secondary. The more 
powerful the vital energy which builds, the more potent 
the latent dynamics or potential force of the products. 
Coal, though classed among the minerals, possesses in- 
finitely greater heat and energy-producing qualities 
than other minerals, because originally its molecules 
were elaborated under the influence of the vito-chem- 
ical or vegetable life element. The animal cell, being 
built up under the operation of the spiritual or animal 



374 NATURAL DIETETICS 

life element, is alive with still higher potencies of vital 
force than those latent in the vegetable cell. . 

The energy -which builds up molecules becomes bound 
or latent in that which it builds. This is illustrated 
in the formation of ice and coal. 

The low temperature which solidifies the molecules 
of water is absorbed and becomes bound or latent in 
the icy cr5^stals which it builds. "When the particles of 
ice distiutegrate under the influence of warmer tem- 
perature, "cold" is liberated in our refrigerator. 

In similar manner, the heat which gives warmth and 
comfort to our homes in the winter time is vital force 
(vito-chemical), plus the sun-light and sun-heat which 
were absorbed in the formation of vegetable cells in 
the growing plants and trees of primeval forests. 

Vital force corresponds to fire ; food corresponds to 
fuel. If the life force has departed from an animal or 
human body, no amount of food can create animal heat. 
As the fuel in the furnace has to be consumed by fire 
before it can liberate heat, so the food in the body has 
to be consumed by the life force before its latent heat 
and energy can be liberated. 

When in the processes of digestion and assimilation 
the latent energies stored in the food have been liber- 
ated and absorbed by the body, nothing remains of the 
erstwhile food but poisonous excrements which, if not 
properly eliminated, become destructive to the organ- 
ism, — the organic has become inorganic. When the life 
principle is taken away from food materials nothing 
remains but waste and poison. 

Vegetable and animal food are therefore foods only 
by virtue of the vital and solar energy locked up in 
their molecules. As soon as the vegetable or animal 
molecules disintegrate by any process whatsoever, their 



THE FUNCTIONS OF FOOD AND DRINK 375 

vital energy is dissipated and lost. This explains why 
boiling, baking and frying wastes food energy; why 
fermentation changes wholesome foods into poisonous 
alcohol; why "predigested foods" are weakened foods. 
The meddling art of the cook, chemist and distiller, 
therefore, seldom improves upon Nature's foods, and 
the chemist's dream, that all foods will some day be 
made in his laboratory and handed out in tablet form, 
will always remain a dream. 

Among modern writers who boldly defend the 
mechanical theory of vital force, no one has done more 
ingenious work than Dr. Thomas Powell in his inter- 
esting book, "Fundamentals and Requirements of 
Health and Disease." 

Therefore, I shall quote and discuss his theory in 
order to contrast the mechanical and vital conceptions 
of vital force. 

Among other startling claims, he asserts that he has 
discovered the nature and the modus operandi of vital, 
or, as he calls it, " vito-motive " force. 

The substance of his theory is this : The red, arterial 
blood stores carbonaceous compounds in the interior of 
the muscle fibrils. When the Ego wills to move a 
muscle, the mind (will) sends a nerve spark to the 
muscle fibrils. This ignites, or explodes, the C. 0. H. 
molecules stored in the fibril. The combustion of the 
carbon compounds produces carbonic acid. The car- 
bonic acid expands the muscle fibril into a round, 
balloon-like shape. This shortens or contracts the 
fibrils lengthwise. The contraction of the muscle 
fibrils also contracts the muscle fascia, and the muscle 
in its entirety. Therefore, he claims that carbonic 
acid is the mysterious vito-motive power which so long 
has eluded the search of scientists. 



376 NATUR^iL DIETETICS 

In Older to present his theory correctly, I shall quote 
a few paragraphs from his book. 
Page 189. 

' ' The facts which are involved in the transformation 
of the potential energy of the food into the kinetic 
form, as we find it in the vito-motive power, cannot 
be too deeply impressed upon the mind; hence it will 
be well to repeat: 1. The nutrient matter stored in 
the cells in the consummation of the nutritive process, 
consisting as it does of a most intimate comminglemeut 
of food and oxygen — of a combustible with a supporter 
of combustion — is in a state of extremely unstable 
equilibrium, and is, therefore, nothing more nor less 
than a delicately balanced explosive of high potential ; 
2. The carbon and oxygen thus intimately associated 
is brought into chemical combination by act of the 
will expressed by means of the nerves and nervous in- 
fluence; 3. Whenever the will so orders, an explosion 
must occur in every cell which is included in or reached 
by the volitional edict; 4. The carbon dioxide thus 
generated within the cells forces them to expand and 
in a direction which is transverse to the longer axis 
of the fibril, this being the line of least resistance, as 
above explained ; 5. The expanding cells impinge upon 
the inner surface of the fascia, forcing it to yield in 
like manner and for the same reason, thus producing 
that transverse expansion and longitudinal shortening 
of a muscle on which the physical activities of the body 
chiefly and evidently depend, as above stated. In 
short, the will acts, the nutrient matter explodes, the 
cells expand, the fascia yields, the muscle contracts, 
and the vital machinery is set in motion; not, how- 
ever, in consequence of 'metabolism' of the 'white 
blood corpuscle, ' but of the red ; not by reason of the 



THE FUNCTIONS OF FOOD AND DRINK 377 

'metamorphosis' of the tissues of the body, but of 
food; not by the energy of 'resurrected sunbeams' 
nor of any other immaterial agency, but of expanding 
carbon dioxide gas; not in consequence of the pres- 
ence of nitrogen in the food nor of any other incom- 
bustible element, but of carbon, and this not from the 
inorganic world, but the organic ; not by a product of 
any laboratory of human origin, but of the plant world 
— that immeasurably greater concern which was insti- 
tuted by the All- Wise-Being, and for the express pur- 
pose of effecting the separation of those elements — 
carbon and oxygen from whose reunion within the 
nutritive cells of the living organism must come all 
the energies, physical, nervous and thermal of the 
entire domain of animated nature." 
Page 222. 

"It shows that the doctrine of 'vis vitae,' held by 
Liebig and his contemporaries, and recently revised to 
some extent, is utterly erroneous; that while it is true 
that there is an ego or inherent vital principle, it is 
also true that the movements of the living organism 
are due to the intra-cellular production and action of 
the vito-motive power — that energy displaying agent 
which is known to science as carbon dioxide, and to the 
world at large as carbonic acid gas. . . ." 

I do not understand why Dr. Powell does not give 
hydrogen credit for the work performed in the muscle 
fibrils, as well as the carbonic acid. In the combus- 
tion of carbonaceous compoimds, such as glycogen, dex- 
trose, glucose and hemoglobin, a great deal of hydro- 
gen is liberated, as well as carbonic acid, and the 
former gas is more powerful to expand balloons than 
carbonic acid. 

If Dr. Powell's ingenious theory of muscle inflation 



378 NATURAL DIETETICS 

and contraction by carbonic acid is trne he has onlj 
discovered the modus operandi of carbon combustion 
in so far as it is concerned in the production of mus- 
cular energy. But he has failed to discover the great 
Life Force which elaborates the carbon compounds 
in the vegetable and animal kingdom and which ignites 
and explodes them in the cells and muscle fibrils of 
animal and human bodies. 

If no immaterial agency is concerned in the produc- 
tion of muscular labor and of animal heat, how does 
he explain that these manifestations of kinetic energy 
suddenly cease when the life element departs, when 
death takes place? When the body is dead, muscle 
labor and heat production cease, though the corpse 
be heated far beyond the normal temperature of the 
living body, and though the material elements for the 
production of heat and energy are present as before. 
The question which the doctor has failed to answer is : 
"What is it that makes possible the combustion of the 
carbon compounds and the production of carbonic 
acid gas? 

Elated over the discovery of the very last stage of 
muscle labor, he ignores the Intelligence and Power 
which created the fuel material, as well as the wonder* 
ful organism which consumes it — the "Life" or "Vital 
Force" which animates the atom as well as solar sys- 
tems and their sentient inhabitants. 

It is not true that carbonic acid is the great vito- 
motive force. This gas may be the motive force in 
the rendering of muscle labor, but the nerve spark 
which produces it through igniting the carbon com- 
pounds, and the Mind and Will who release the nerve 
spark or impulse are much nearer and more potent 
expressions of the Great Life Force than carbonic acid 



THE FUNCTIONS OF POOD AND DRINK 379 

gas. After all, our conception of the nature of vito- 
motive force, as summed up in the following sentence 
is more rational: 

All forms of energy which manifest in the mineral, 
vegetable, animal and human entities are secondary 
energies, derived from the primary source of all forces, 
powers and energies in the siderial universe, from that 
which we call God, Life, Oversoul, Universal Intelli- 
gence, Buddha, Praua, etc., each one according to his 
own highest conception and best understanding. 

This is the "Vis Vitae," the ''Animus Mundi," 
ignored and denied by the speculative sophistries of 
materialistic science, but recognized and described by 
Swedenborg as the Heat of Divine Love and the Light 
of Divine Wisdom, radiating from the Great Central 
Sun of the Universe through all space and animating 
aU things. 

GROUP m. (F.) Fats and Oils (O.O.H.) 

To this group of food materials belong aU oils and 
fats. They are called hj^drocarbons, because they, also, 
are chemically composed of carbon, hydrogen and 
oxygen, — but they contain the hydrogen and oxygen 
in proportions which do not form water. (HjO) The 
melting of sugar liberates water, the melting of fats 
does not; it produces oils only. 

In the vital processes of the body, fats and oils also 
serve as producers of heat and energy. Aside from 
this, they act as lubricants for the digestive tract. 
Another "new discovery" of Dr. Powell is that fats 
are not proper foods. That fats, as such, have no food 
value for the human body. This theory, however, seems 
fallacious, because Nature, in milk and eggs, provides 



380 NATURAL DIETETICS 

fats for the ncAv-born miiinal and human in consider- 
able quantities. We would rather trust the wisdom of 
Nature in such matters than the far-fetched theories 
and "new discoveries" of writers on food chemistry. 

GROUP IV. (P.) Proteids or Nitrogenous Foods 

The principal representatives of this group are albu- 
min (white of egg), myosin (the flesh of animal or 
human bodies), gluten (the dark outer part of cereals), 
and the globulin of the blood. 

The simplest forms of protein matter are made up of 
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. The more 
complex forms, in addition to these four basic elements, 
contain phosphorus and sulphur. From the chemical 
composition of proteins it will be seen that, like the 
food materials of the first, second and third groups, 
they contain the C.O.H. molecule and can therefore 
take the place of starches, dextrines and sugars, as 
producers of heat and energy. 

But in addition to these functions, proteids serve 
other very important purposes in the metabolism (vital 
economy) of the body. Vegetable, animal and human 
cells are composed of protoplasm, which means protein 
matter. The building and repair of these cells there- 
fore depends upon a sufficient supply of protein food 
materials. 

It is for this reason that starches, sugars and fats 
cannot entirely take place of nitrogenous foods. 

If the food materials of these first four groups had 
no other effects upon the human organism than those 
just described there would be no problem of dietetics. 
Any ordinary food mixture would satisfy the needs of 
the body. But we find that, aside from their beneficial 



THE FUNCTIONS OF FOOD AND DRINK 381 

effects upon the organism, these foods, in the processes 
of digestion, liberate certain waste and morbid mate- 
rials, which if allowed to accumulate in considerable 
quantities in the tissues of the body, endanger health 
and life. 

These morbid by-products and end-products of 
starchy, fatty and protein digestion consist largely of 
poisonous acids, alkaloids and ptomaines. This is ex- 
plained by the fact that all the six elements (C.O.H. 
N.P.S.) which make up the food materials in the first 
four groups are eleetro-magnetically negative, acid- 
forming elements. When in the processes of digestion 
and oxidation, the foods are torn apart and divided 
into their component elements and proximate elements, 
these enter into new combinations, many of which, 
when they accumulate in the human body, become 
obstructive and destructive. To elucidate this more 
fully, we shall quote a few paragraphs from "Nature 
Cure, Philosophy and Practice," p. 291: 

"Nearly every disease originating in the human body 
is due to or accompanied by the excessive formation of 
different kinds of acids in the system, the most im- 
portant of which are uric, carbonic, sulphuric, phos- 
phoric, and oxalic acids. These, together with 
xanthines, poisonous alkaloids, and ptomaines, are 
formed in and through the processes of protein and 
starch digestion, and in the breaking down and decay 
of cells and tissues. 

"Of these different waste products, uric acid causes 
probably the most trouble in the organism. The major- 
ity of diseases arising within the human body are due 
to its erratic behavior. Together with other destructive 
acids and alkaloids it is responsible for the many forms 
of rheumatic diseases, arteriosclerosis, arthritic rheu- 



882 NATURAL DIETETICS 

matism and heart disease ; for the formation of stones 
(calculi) ; for catarrhal diseases, for high blood pres- 
eure, and for the functional forms of diabetes and 
Bright 's disease. 

"Dr. Haig, of London, has done excellent work in the 
investigation of uric acid poisoning, but he becomes 
one-sided when he makes uric acid the scapegoat for 
practically all disease conditions originating in the 
human body. In his philosophy of disease he fails to 
take into consideration the effects of other acids and 
systemic poisons. For instance, he does not mention 
the fact that carbonic acid is produced in the system 
somewhat similarly to the formation of coal gas in the 
furnace; and that its accumulation prevents the en- 
trance of oxygen into the cells and tissues, thus caus- 
ing asphyxiation or oxygen starvation, which mani- 
fests in the sj'-mptoms of anemia and tuberculosis. 

"It may be true, as Dr. Powell claims, that carbonic 
acid is the motive force which expands the muscle cells, 
and causes muscular contraction, but at the same time 
this gas, after it has done its work, is as poisonous to 
the body as when it escapes from burning coal or char- 
coal. This poisonous gas has to be neutralized and 
eliminated from the system by the positive alkaline 
element, sodium, — of the fifth group. 

"Neither does Dr. Haig explain the effects of other 
destructive by-products formed during the digestion 
of starches and proteins. Sulphuric acid and phos- 
phoric acid actually burn up the tissues of the body. 
This explains why people living on a "highly nutri- 
tious" meat and egg (protein) diet often grow thinner 
instead of fleshier. Instead of building up, the acids 
of sulphur and phosphorus burn up the tissues of their 
bodies. They destroy the cellulose membranes which 



THE FUNCTIONS OP POOD AND DRINK 383 

form the protecting skins or envelopes of the cells, dis- 
solve the protoplasm, and allow the latter to escap* 
into the circulation. This accounts for the symptoms 
of Bright 's disease, for the presence of albumin (cell 
protoplasm) in blood and urine, for the clogging of thet 
circulation, the consequent stagnation and accumula- 
tion of blood serum (dropsy) and for the final break- 
ing-down of the tissues (necrosis) resulting in open 
sores and ulcers. 

* ' Excess of phosphorus and the acids derived from it 
overstimulate the brain and nervous system, causing 
nervousness, irritability, hysteria and the different 
forms of mania. 

'/An example of this is the 'distemper' of a horse 
when given too many oats and not enough grass or hay. 
The excess of phosphorus and phosphoric acids formed 
from the protein materials of the grain, if not neutral- 
ized by the alkaline minerals contained in grasses, hay, 
or straw, will overstimulate and irritate the nervous 
system of the animal and cause it to become nervous, 
irritable and vicious. These symptoms disappear when 
the rations of oats are decreased and when more fresh 
grass or hay is fed in place of the grain. 

"Similar effects to those produced upon the horse by 
an excess of grain are caused in the human organism, 
especially in the sensitive nervous system of the child, 
by a sui'plus of proteid foods, of meats, eggs, nuts, 
cereals and pulses. 

* ' Still, when patients suffering from over-stimulation 
of the brain and nervous system consult the doctor, his 
advice in almost every instance is : ' Your nerves are 
weak and overwrought. You need plenty of good, 
nourishing food (broths, meat and eggs), and a good 
tonic' " 



384 NATURAL DIETETICS 

The "remedies" prescribed by the doctor are the 
very things which caused the trouble in the first place. 

GROUP V. (M.) Positive Mineral Elements 

To this group belong all food materials which run 
low in the acid-forming carbohydrates, hydrocarbons 
and proteids of the first four groups, but high in the 
positive, alkaline mineral elements, the most important 
of which are iron, sodium, lime, potassium, magnesium 
and manganese. 

The old school of medicine considers fruits and vege- 
tables of no importance because they do not contain 
enough of the "highly nutritious" starches, fats and 
proteins. We now understand why, just on account of 
this and by virtue of their high percentages of acid- 
binding positive, mineral elements, the fruits and vege- 
tables are of the greatest importance in the economy 
of the body. Aside from being the neutralizers and 
eliminators of morbid materials, the positive mineral 
elements are the principal components of the blood and 
of the most important secretions of the body. They 
constitute the "richness" of the blood and give textile 
strength and stamina to the tissues of the body. One- 
half of the substance of the bony structures consists 
of lime. Potassium is to the muscular tissues what lime 
is to the bones. 

These mineral elements are the building stones in the 
tissues of the body, while the protein elements are the 
mortar. The wall built of mortar alone could not 
stand ; it would soon crumble to pieces. The stones 
imbedded in the mortar are necessary to give it the 
textile strength. So the strength, resistance and stam- 
ina of the tissues of the body depend upon the mineral 
and earthy elements. 



THE FUNCTIONS OP POOD AND DRINK 385 

Polarity 

Furthermore, the generation of positive electricity 
and magnetism in the body depends upon an abundance 
of the positive mineral elements in the circulation. 
Health is positive; disease negative. When the nega- 
tive elements are in preponderance, weakness and dis- 
ease, both physical and mental, are bound to result. 

From the foregoing it becomes apparent why in our 
natural diet we endeavor to reduce the negative food 
materials of the first four groups and to increase the 
positive alkaline mineral elements of the fifth group. 

Bulk 

There is still another reason why fruits and vege- 
tables, together with the hulls of grains, are of great 
importance in the processes of digestion and elimina- 
tion. These food materials contain large amounts of 
cellulose and woody fiber, which are looked upon ordi- 
narily as useless waste, but in reality render valuable 
services. They stimulate in a natural manner the peri- 
staltic movements of the bowels and act as scourers and 
purifiers and therefore as natural laxatives.

CHAPTER V 
DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION 

Digestion and assimilation may be divided into the 
following stages: 

1. The in-taking of food. 

2. Its mastication. 

3. Its insalivation. 

4. Its deglutition. 

5. Its ehymification in the stomach. 

6. Its chylification through the intestinal digestion. 

7. The absorption of the chyle by the membranes 
lining the intestinal tract, and its transmission through 
the lacteal and venous vessels into the circulation. 

8. Elimination and defaecation of the end products 
and waste materials of digestion. 

The limited space of this volume does not admit of 
going into the details of these various processes. They 
can be studied in any encyclopedia or work on physiol- 
ogy. We shall confine ourselves to giving a brief out- 
line of the processes of digestion and assimilation in 
so far as this will facilitate a better understanding of 
the problems of natural dietetics discussed in this 
volume. 

The office of digestion is to prepare the food-stuffs 
for absorption into the fluids of the body, and for 
utilization in the various processes of nutrition. To 
make this possible, the coarse and complex food ma- 
terials have to be dissolved and rendered diffusible in 

386 



DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION 387 

order to facilitate their absorption through the mem- 
branes of the epithelial cells which cover the walls 
of the intestinal tract. This breaking up of the com- 
plex food materials into simpler compounds, or into 
their constituent, proximate elements is accomplished 
by the influence of the digestive ferments secreted by 
certain glandular structures belonging to the digestive 
apparatus. 

In the following brief survey of the processes of 
digestion and assimilation, we shall follow the various 
food materials through their transformations to their 
final destination in the vital economy of the body. 

Orthodox physiology and food chemistry, as we have 
pointed out in other places, deal with three food classes 
only. These are: 

1. The carbo-hydrates, comprising staxches, dex- 
trines and sugars. 

2. The hydro-carbons, comprising fats and oils. 

3. Proteids. The principal representatives of this 
group are albumin (white of egg), gluten of grains and 
legumes, myosinogen of fleshy tissues, serum-globulin 
of the blood, hemoglobin of the red blood corpuscles, 
and caseinogen of milk and cheese. 

Digestion of Starches 

The starches are acted on in the mouth, after thor- 
ough mastication and insalivation, by the ferment 
ptyalin of the saliva, and transformed into dextrines 
and sugars (maltose and glucose). Ptyalin acts only 
in an alkaline or neutral medium. If the starches are 
thoroughly masticated and insalivated, the action of 
the ptyalin continues for twenty to forty minutes in 
the stomach. By that time its action is checked by the 



388 NATURAL DIETETICS 

acidity of the gastric juices. It is for this reason 
that many people cannot mix starchy foods with acid 
fruits and vegetables. It seems that in such eases 
fruit and vegetable acids increase, temporarily at least, 
the acidity of the stomach so as to interfere with the 
action of the ptyalin on the starches. However, as we 
pointed out in the article entitled "Mixing of Starches 
and Acids," page 466, this is not true in all cases. 

The transformation of the starches (after they leave 
the stomach) into the simplest and most refined forms 
of dextroses and glucoses (sugars) continues in the 
intestines under the influence of the pancreatic ferment 
amylase or amylopsin. The ferment, invertase, found 
in the intestinal fluid, changes cane sugar into laevu- 
lose, and the latter into glucose. The starches must 
be reduced to dextroses and glucoses before they can 
be assimilated by the epithelial cells lining the intesti- 
nal walls and before they can be transmitted through 
these into the circulation. 

From what has been said it becomes apparent why 
it is necessary to thoroughly masticate and insalivate 
all starchy foods. This is of especial importance for 
those who suffer from intestinal indigestion. If starchy 
foods, as is usually done, are made slippery with milk 
and cream and swallowed down without being thor- 
oughly mixed with saliva, they remain unchanged in 
their passage through mouth and stomach, and if there 
is a tendency to, or actual condition of intestinal in- 
digestion, then the starches are not transformed at aU, 
and instead of being absorbed into the circulation as 
valuable fuel materials in the forms of dextroses and 
glucoses, they enter into processes of decay and fer- 
mentation and fill the system with noxious gases and 
poisons. 



DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION 389 

If more starchy food materials are taken in than 
can be absorbed by the circulation and utilized by 
cells and tissues, part of the surplus is stored in the 
liver and in the muscles in the form of glycogen, to be 
drawn upon when the intake of carbo-hydrates falls 
below the requirements of the body. On page 376 we 
described Dr. Thomas Powell's ingenious and plausible 
theory of the conversion of the carbon compounds in 
the cells of the muscles and of other tissues of the body 
into heat and muscular energy. 

Digestion of Fats 

The fats are not acted on at all by the saliva, and by 
the gastric juice of the stomach, only in so far as the 
hydro-chloric acid partly digests and dissolves the 
membranes of the fat globules, rendering their con- 
tents more soluble and more prone to the action of the 
fat splitting ferments in the intestinal tract. The 
principal one of these ferments is the lipase (steapsin) 
of the pancreatic fluid. The action of the lipase is 
greatly facilitated and intensified by the bile. In 
fact, the digestive acti%'ity of all the pancreatic fer- 
ments becomes possible only after the contents of the 
intestinal tract (chyme and chyle) have been changed 
from the acid condition in which they left the stomach 
to the alkaline, because the pancreatic and intestinal 
ferments act in an alkaline medium only. 

The fats are split up into glycerine and fatty acids. 
These end-products of fatty digestion are absorbed by 
the epithelial cells lining the intestinal walls. "While 
passing through these cells the glycerine and fatty 
acids are reunited and built up into fat globules, and 
these are then transmitted through the lacteal vessels 
into the lymphatic circulation, and finally into the 



390 NATUR.VL DIETETICS 

venous circulation, to be further refined and prepared 
for assimilation in their passage through the liver. 

Digestion of the Proteids 

Proteid food materials serve two principal purposes.' 
They are composed of six elements (C. 0. H. N. P. S.). 
The first three elements may be utilized in the economy 
of the body for the production of heat and energy, the 
same as the (C. 0. H.) molecules in carbo-hydrates and 
hydro-carbons, but aside from this the proteid food 
materials serve other important purposes in the build- 
ing up and repairing of cells and tissues. The sub- 
stance of cells consists of protoplasm; that is, proteid 
matter, therefore, the building and repair of cells re- 
quires proteid foodstuffs, but the transformation of the 
proteid materials as they exist in foods into the pro- 
teid substances of the living cells and tissues of the 
human body involves profound changes, different from, 
and far more complex than the simple hydrolytic re- 
duction of carbo-hydrates and hydro-carbons. 

The progressive digestive changes of the proteids 
into proteose, peptones and amino-acids begin in the 
stomach under the influence of the pepsin secreted by 
the cell linings of the stomach. The pepsin acts only in 
an acid medium and this is created by the hydrochloric 
acid which forms part of the gastric secretions. The 
transformation of the proteids continues in the intes- 
tinal tract under the action of the trypsin. The tryp- 
sin is not, as was formerly believed, solely a secretion 
of the pancreas, but is in reality a compound formed 
by the chemical union of trypsinogen of the pancreatic 
fluid with the enterokinase secreted by the epithelial 
cells of the intestinal walls, especially in the duodenum. 

The trypsin acts only in an alkaline medium, and 



DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION 391 

this is furnished by the in-pouring of the bile into the 
chy-me as the latter enters the intestines in its periodic 
discharges from the stomach. 

It seems to be the acidity of the chyme and the fer- 
ment secretin of the pancreatic juice which stimulate 
the flow of the bile into the duodenum, as well as the 
secretion of the enterokinase. The transformation of 
the proteid food materials into proteose, peptones and 
amino-acids continues in the intestines, and these re- 
fined forms of proteid matter are then absorbed by the 
cell lining of the intestinal walls and elaborated into 
the more complex proteid substances as they exist in 
the human body. To recapitulate, the breaking down 
of all food materials into simpler and more refined com- 
pounds serves several purposes : 

1. To separate waste and indigestible matter from 
the nutritious substances. 

2. To make the food materials sufficiently soluble 
and diffusible so they can be assimilated by the ab- 
sorbent membranes of the digestive tract. 

3. To liberate their latent heat and vital energy. 

4. To change the coarse compounds of food ma- 
terials into the more refined and complex materials of 
the living cells and tissues of the human body. 

If we did assimilate animal blood, flesh and fat in 
their original forms, the tissues of our bodies would 
soon resemble those of pigs, cows, and sheep. In 
order to preserve the individuality and integrity of the 
various species and families of animals and of man, it 
is necessary that all food materials be broken down 
first into their simplest compounds and proximate ele- 
ments and then reconstructed (synthesized) into the 
building materials, cells, tissues, and organs of the 
animal or human being which consumes the foods.

The above-nained acids have a very irritating and

the organs and tissues of the body. They must be neu- 
tralized and eliminated by the positive alkaline mineral 
elements of the fifth group. Meats and eggs generate 
in the system large amounts of these destructive acids.

The foregoing substances are only a few of the dozens 
of different ptomaines (corpse poisons) which have 
been discovered in putrefying flesh and fish and in the 
tissues of living animal and human bodies. 

These morbid products of decomposing carbonaceous 
and protein matter form the most prolific soil for the 
propagation of germs, bacteria and bacilli found in 
the worst forms of acute and chronic diseases, such as 
typhoid fever, diphtheria, appendicitis, ptomaine poi- 
soning, acute and chronic gastritis, enteritis, peritonitis, 
and of tuberculosis and cancer. 

It wnll be seen that all the poisonous acids, colloids, 
alkaloids and ptomaines before mentioned are made up 
of the six negative, acid-forming elements (C.O.H.N. 
P.S.) found in the foods of the first four groups of 
our classification, — in the starches, sugars, fats and 
proteins, — and these poisonous by-products and end- 
products of starchy and protein metabolism must be 
neutralized and eliminated from the system by the 
positive, alkaline, mineral elements which abound in 
the food materials of the fifth group, especially in the 
juicy fruits and vegetables. 

These facts in Nature form the scientific basis of 
Natural Dietetics and of rational vegetarianism. 



CHAPTER Vn 

THE TENSING AND RELAXING EFFECTS OP 

FOODS UPON THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS 

AND THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE 

There are two forces at work in the human organism, 
the one tensing and contracting, the other relaxing 
and expanding. Normal function, or health, results 
from the equilibrium between the two. This equilibrium 
between contending forces we call the positive condi- 
tion of health; departure from it in either direction, 
the negative condition of disease. As a rule acids exert 
a tensing, contracting influence, alkalies relax and ex- 
pand. These facts should be kept in mind when study- 
ing the physiology and psychology of foods and medi- 
cines. 

The extremes of tension and relaxation are expressed, 
in the functions of the body, by constipation and diar- 
rhoea. "We shall find that as a rule, acid or acid produc- 
ing foods have a contracting, constipating influence 
and the alkaline foods a relaxing, laxative influence. 

If the intestines are functioning normally, the feces 
should pass freely and easily, they should be well 
formed and leave the parts perfectly clean. After an 
evacuation there should be a feeling of perfect clean- 
liness, of freedom, and of buoyancy. 

It is possible to have daily passages from the intes- 
tines and yet retain hard incrustations of fetid matter. 
An individual may suffer from malnutrition, deficient 

397 



398 NATURAL DIETETICS 

elimination and auto-intoxication, even if the feces are 
able to force a passage through hardened accumula- 
tions. Often this condition is indicated by the thinness 
of the discharges. 

If the feces are black, too much of the bile and uric 
acid producing foods (proteids) have been taken. If 
they are too light, probably not enough proteids and 
starches are consumed. 

The extremes of tension and relaxation are illustrated, 
on the one hand by the collaemic forms of uric acid 
poisoning, in which the capillaries are blocked, surface 
circulation impeded, blood in the arteries and vital 
organs at high tension, bovrels sluggish and consti- 
pated; on the other hand the extremes of relaxation 
are characterized by weakened blood vessels and flabby 
muscles. The blood serum seems to leak in morbid 
perspiration from the relaxed tissues, and the bowels 
are usually very loose. 

In mental and psychic conditions, the extreme of 
tension is portrayed in the excitable, over-active, talka- 
tive, boisterous and sometimes violent types of nervous- 
ness, hysteria and delusional insanity. The extreme 
of relaxation is exhibited in weak, negative, psychic 
cases. These patients are languid, listless, indifferent 
to surroundings, too apathetic to eat, dress or to attend 
to their bodily needs. 

GROUP IV. Proteids 

By reference to the tables on page 430 we find that 
proteid materials are made up of six negative acid-pro- 
ducing elements (C.O.H.N.P.S). Proteids are there- 
fore, above all others, acid-producing foods. In the 
metabolism of the body they produce uric, carbonic, 
sulphuric, phosphoric, oxalic and a number of other 



TENSING AND RELAXING EFFECTS OF POODS 399 

acids; therefore it is not to be wondered at, that pro- 
teid foods are constipating. 

Lean meats, fish and fowl, if taken by themselves, are 
very constipating. Fat meats, taken in moderation and 
in right combinations, have a lubricating, laxative 
effect ; if taken in excess they produce constipation and 
a sticky condition of the bowels and feces ; eggs, being 
rich in albumen, sulphur and phosphorus, when taken 
by themselves or in combination with other tensing 
foods, are also constipating. Milk in small quantities 
has for many a constipating effect ; taken in large quan- 
tities, as prescribed by some dieticians, it has in many 
instances a laxative effect, because of the amount of 
water with which the system is deluged ; in other cases, 
existing constipation is intensified by this practice. 

The vegetable products richest in proteid are the 
legumes (peas, beans and lentils) and the cereals. 
These are generally called the glutenous foods. If 
taken by themselves or in combination with other tens- 
ing foods they have a constipating effect; the feces 
become hard and brittle. Nuts, being rich in fats and 
proteid, if taken in excess or with other tensing foods, 
also have on most people a constipating effect. 

Carbohydrates (Groups I and 11) 

Foods belonging to the carbohydrate groups, which 
in the natural state contain large amounts of organic 
salts and other laxative principles, do not impede the 
normal activities of the intestines, unless taken to 
excess. 

Such foods are whole grain preparations of cereals, 
the unrefined brown sugar products of cane, beet, 
maple, etc. If, however, the starchy and glutenous 
principles or the pure sugar are artificially extracted

from natural food products they become proximate 
and inorganic food elements, and these separated from 
the organic salt and other laxative principles exert a 
tensing and constipating influence. Such proximate 
food elements are starch, gluten, white sugar, etc. 
Honey is one of Nature's finest foods. Besides being 
rich in saccharine matter it contains positive mineral 
elements and is animated with the animal life element. 
Molasses is much more of a laxative than white sugar, 
because it contains the organic salts of which the re- 
fined sugar has been robbed. 

Hydrocarbons (Group HE) 

Animal fats, cream, and vegetable oils, taken in mod- 
erate quantities, have a purely mechanical, laxative 
effect, because they act as lubricators to the organism 
as a whole and especially to the intestinal tract. If 
taken in excess, however, or in combination with tens- 
ing foods, they have a constipating effect, because the 
liver and pancreas cannot furnish sufficient amounts 
of bile and steapsin for their reduction, and fats which 
fail to be reduced or saponified produce a sticky condi- 
tion of the intestines. Even too much olive oil, which 
many vegetarians seem to think can be taken without 
harm, may therefore become a source of constipation. 
We must not overlook the fact that it is a proximate 
element. The olive itself, containing the oily princi- 
ples in combination with large percentages of organic 
salts, has a much more beneficial effect. 

Organic Salts (Group V) 

In this group belong all foods comparatively poor 
in proteids, carbohydrates and hydrocarbons, and rich 



TENSING AND RELAXING EFFECTS OF POODS 401 

in the organic salts of sodium, iron, lime, magnesium 
and potassium. The most valuable in this respect are 
the green, leafy vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, 
cabbage, celery, kale, asparagus, watercress, the green 
tops of roots, etc. Next in order come the roots: 
radishes, carrots, parsnips, beets, rutabagas, onions and 
horseradish. Potatoes, although they contain con- 
siderable amounts of potassium and lime, are deficient 
in sodium, iron and magnesium, but they are rich in 
vitamines. On the whole, the starchy elements pre- 
dominate over the organic salts and they are therefore 
placed in the carbohydrate group. Among the fruits, 
the banana corresponds to the potato among the vege- 
tables; it is rich in starchy and saccharine elements 
but comparatively poor in organic salts. 

Nature's Wise Provision 

It is interesting to note how, for each season of the 
year. Nature furnishes the foods and medicines best 
adapted to changing conditions. In the fall we gather 
the hardy, nourishing, heat and energy-producing 
cereals, legumes and nuts, which furnish the fuel 
materials necessary to do the winter's work and to 
protect us against the cold. These acid-producing 
foods, through their tensing, contracting influences, 
help us to retain the heat of the body; on the other 
hand they also favor the retention of waste matter and 
poisons. During the winter season, increased amounts 
of food, closed doors and windows, pores contracted 
and closed by the cold, all favor the accumulation of 
fermentable waste matter in the system. 

"With the first thaws of springtime these waste mate- 
rials begin to ferment and to produce fevers, cold* 



402 NATURAL DIETETICS 

and catarrhs. Nature again provides the proper foods 
and remedies : lettuce, spinach, radishes, young onions, 
watercress, rhubarb, asparagus, and other tender, lus- 
cious vegetables furnish the best laxatives and diu- 
retics, those which most effectively assist Nature in 
her spring house cleaning. 

In the heat of summer the watery, refreshing and 
cooling melons, cantaloupes and cucumbers are the most 
effective agents in relaxing the bowels and the pores 
of the skin, allowing free evacuation and enhancing 
heat evaporation through the surface of the body. 
These delicious summer foods owe their relaxing qual- 
ities to the large percentage of alkaline salts which 
they contain. Their purging effect need not be feared. 
By cleansing the system of waste matter and poisons 
this purging prevents dangerous inflammations and 
fevers. 



CHAPTER Vni 
STANDABD FOODS 

Milk and Arterial Blood the Only Standard Food Com- 
binations in Nature 

Animal and human bodies are composed of certain 
well-defined elements, in certain well-defined propor- 
tions. Chemistry so far has discovered seventeen of 
these elements in appreciable quantities and ascer- 
tained their more important functions in the body. If 
any of these are present in over-abundance, and others 
are deficient in quantity, or wliolly lacking, there will 
be abnormal function or disease. Therefore, the ele- 
ments of nutrition must be provided in right propor- 
tion in order to meet the needs of the body. 

The quest of natural food reformers after a normal, 
natural diet is hence not so silly and impossible as some 
people would have us believe. 

Many old school food scientists, however, have recog- 
nized the desirability and possibility of establishing 
standard food combinations. But all these authorities, 
whether they are advocates of the meat, mixed, or 
vegetarian diet, deal only with proteids, fats, and car- 
bohydrates. This is shown in the following ''Standard 
Daily Rations," given by "regular authorities" on 
Dietetics on page 616 of Kirk's Physiology. This work 
is used as a text book in many prominent medical uni- 
versities in this country. 

403 



404 NATURAL DIETETICS 

On the above mentioned page Molcsehott gives the 
following normal diet : 

Proteids 120 grammes 

Fats 90 grammes 

Carbohydrates 333 grammes 

Ranke's normal diet, given on the same page, closely 
resembles Moleschott's: 

Proteids 100 grammes 

Fats 100 grammes 

Carbohydrates 250 grammes 

In explanation of these standard food combinations 
Kirke says: "The nutritive value of the diet depends 
chiefly upon the amount of carbon and nitrogen it con- 
tains." Which means — proteid and carbohydrate foods 
are the most important. 

The leaders of American vegetarianism, building on 
these old school theories and food standards in making 
up their vegetarian diet combinations searched prin- 
cipally for substitutes for meat and eggs, that is, for 
foods rich in proteids, fats and starches. As a conse- 
quence, we find that the dietetics of our best known 
vegetarian sanitariums and food reformers deal only 
with proteids, fats, and carbohydrates. The daily bul- 
letins giving dietary advice to the patients of these 
institutions deal with these three proximate food ele- 
ments only. 

All widely advertised breakfast and pre-digested 
health foods in the market are made up of grains, peas, 
beans, peanuts, cocoanuts or combinations of these food 
materials. 

Breaking up these natural products of the soil into 
proximate elements, such as protose, gluten, white flour, 



STANDARD FOODS 405 

white sugar, etc., and devitalizing them by cooking, 
steaming and roasting tends to make them more nega- 
tive than they are already in the natural state. 

The proximate elements, proteids, fats, and carbo- 
hydrates dealt with in old school dietetics contain six 
elements only out of the seventeen found in the human 
body. What about the others — the mineral elements? 

Kirke and all other "regular" authorities merely 
mention these all important mineral elements and 
bunch them as "inorganic salts," or "ash," and claim 
that any adequate food supply of proteids, fats, and 
carbohydrates carries enough of these "inorganic 
salts" to satisfy the needs of the body. 

This assumption, however, is superficial, gratuitous, 
and altogether unscientific. We shall prove in these 
articles, and by means of our tabulated analyses, pages 
430, 431, that exactly the reverse is true — that the 
greatest importance in the vital functions of the body 
attaches to the organic salts or mineral elements ; that 
the only danger lies in the excessive use of proteids, 
fats, and carbohydrates, and that the difficulty in 
rational dietetics lies in procuring in the daily dietary, 
a sufficient amount of organic mineral salts without at 
the same time overloading the system with starchy 
and nitrogenous elements. 

"Regular" authorities also make a mistake in stat- 
ing their normal diet combinations in weight. This is 
always misleading, as the amount of food needed by 
different individuals differs very much in weight. 
Stuffing food into patients by weight in accordance 
with "standard rations" has stuffed numbers of them 
into early graves. An amount of food in weight just 
sufficient for the needs of one person may prove alto- 
gether too much for the next one. The only rational 



406 NATURAL DIETETICS 

way to calculate food proportions is by percentages. 
In order to accomplish this readily it is necessary to 
establish a standard combination of food elements in 
such proportions or percentages as will meet all re- 
quirements of the human organism.* 

Milk was selected by some German scientists as such 
a standard food combination because Nature made it a 
perfect food for the new-bom and growing animal, and 
because it is capable of sustaining the growing organ- 
ism in perfect health and strength. Furthermore, the 
analyses of Dr. Lahman and other chemists disclose the 
interesting fact that the elementary composition of the 
milk of an animal is just about the same as the com- 
position of the ash of its body after cremation. 

Milk is indeed a perfect food for the growing animal, 
but it is not so to be considered for the adult animal 
or man. The reason for this is that the young and 
growing animal requires a great deal more of potas- 
sium and calcium, the tissue building elements, than 
the full grown, adult body. On the other hand, the 
young animal, on account of its greater elasticity, plas- 
ticity, and natural activity in play and sports, elimi- 
nates waste matter much more readily, and therefore 
needs less of the eliminative elements than the mature 
body. 

This is indicated by a comparison of the analyses of 
blood and milk. While milk is richer in the building 
elements, the blood of the adult animal body is richer 
in sodium and iron, the positive ** working" elements. 

*Note. — The first treatise in the English language dealing 
with the functions of the mineral elements in the body was 
written by Otto Curqu6 about nine years ago at the sugges- 
tion of Dr. Lindlahr. The latter then treated the subject more 
fully in the Nature Cur© Magazines, Volumes 1807-1809.

STANDARD POODS 407 

Careful analysis of the animal body and its functions 
discloses the fact that the red (arterial) blood of a 
healthy animal living on natural foods (cattle on green 
pasture) contains in right proportions the various food 
elements required by the animal. The reason for this 
is obvious — the body draws all its nourishment from 
the red (arterial) blood. 

For the above reasons we have chosen milk as a 
standard food combination for the new born, growing 
body, and red (arterial) blood as a normal elementary 
food combination for the fully developed organism, 
after which to pattern our vegetarian food combina- 
tions. We do not mean by the foregoing that people 
should live on blood, but that the red (arterial) blood 
of which we speak contains all the normal elementary 
constituents of a perfect food combination in right 
proportions for the adult organism, and finds its coun- 
terpart in a well-balanced vegetarian diet. 

Cow's Milk More Normal Than Human Milk 

Our tables also reveal the interesting fact that cow's 
milk contains much more of the all-important sodium 
than the human milk and about twice as much calcium 
and iron, which explains why rachitis is so common 
among babies and not to be found among calves. We 
have proved by practical experience that milk fresh 
from a healthy cow is greatly to be preferred as nour- 
ishment for infants to the impoverished milk of scrofu- 
lous mothers. In this connection it is also significant 
to remember that one-half of all "civilized" mothers — 
thanks to unnatural food, drink, vaccination, and poi- 
sonous drugs — are totally incapacitated for nursing 
their young. 



CHAPTER IX 
THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF FOOD 

What is electricity and magnetism? This question 
could be answered by saying, "Everything is elec- 
tricity." One modern scientist never tires of saying, 
"There is nothing but electrons," — and electrons are 
negative particles or charges of electricity. 

A few thousand years ago Pythagoras, and many 
other wise men and mystics of antiquity, claimed that 
"all matter is made up of three elements, substance 
(the one primordial substance), motion and numbers." 
Now, advanced, modern science seems to verify the 
teachings of the ancient wise men. 

The discovery and the study of the X-rays, of radium 
and radio-activity has revealed the fact that the atoms 
of all the different kinds of matter are made up of 
negative charges or particles of electricity, called 
electrons or corpuscles, which revolve around one an- 
other without ever touching, — like the planets in the 
starry heavens swing around their central suns. These 
electrical whirls or vortices tear along the ether (pri- 
mordial substance) like the centripetal force of the 
eddy tears along the water. 

Furthermore, it has been found that the number of 
the particles of negative electricity (electrons) vibrat- 
ing in the atom determine the physical qualities of the 
atom or element. In other words, whether an atom or 

408 



THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OP FOOD 409 

element impresses our sensory organs with the physical 
properties of iron, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen or of any 
one of the other elements of matter depends upon the 
number of electrons in the atom and their modes of 
vibration. 

It has been found that the number of electrons or 
corpuscles in the atom determines its atomic weight. 
Science, in its wonderful achievement, has gone so far 
as to count, approximately, the number of electrons in 
the atoms, — at least, in the lighter ones. 

The electrons, or negative charges of electricity in 
the atom, are accompanied or surrounded by spheres 
of positive electricity, and the unit of these positive 
and negative charges of electricity, has been named 
the "ion." 

Thus we find the teachings of the ancient wise men 
and mystics verified by the discoveries of modern 
science. The "primordial substance" of Pythagoras is 
the ether, in various stages of refinement. "Motion" 
is the oscillation or vibration of the electrons in the 
atom, and "numbers" is the number of electrons or 
corpuscles which make up the atom of matter. 

It has been found that the electro-magnetically nega- 
tive atom has more (negative) corpuscles than are 
necessary to balance its positive electricity, and that 
the electro-magnetically positive atom has fewer nega- 
tive corpuscles than are needed to balance its positive 
sphere of electricity. It is this deficiency or super- 
fluity of negative corpuscles which constitutes positive 
and negative magnetism or polarity, which causes the 
desire of the negative atom to equalize its polarity by 
union with a positive atom. This is what- constitutes the 
chemical affinity, or valency — combining power — of the 
various atoms or elements of matter. The greater the 



410 NATURAL DIETETICS 

surplus in an atom of negative corpuscles, the greater 
will be its desire or chemical affinity for atoms having a 
deficiency of negative electrons, or which are, in other 
words, surcharged with positive electricity. 

Therefore, according to the predominance of the 
positive or negative qualities in force, matter or entity, 
we speak of them as positive or negative. "We learn 
from the foregoing that the law of polarity is funda- 
mental in Nature. On the activities which it pro- 
vokes and regulates is built the entire structure of the 
universe ; the cessation of these activities for the frac- 
tion of a second would make the universe disappear 
into nothingness in the flash of a moment. 

This fundamental law of Nature has been expressed 
by the author of ''Harmonics of Evolution," in the 
words, "There is a principle in Nature which impels 
every entity to seek vibratory correspondence (or 
equilibrium) with another like entity of opposite polar- 
ity." 

The swaying to and fro of positive and negative, the 
desire to balance incomplete polarity, constitutes the 
very ebb and flow of life. All through Nature, from 
the most minute to the greatest and most complex, runs 
this great dividing line between positive and negative. 

In the mineral kingdom, polarity manifests in the at- 
traction and repulsion of atoms. In the vegetable, 
animal and human kingdom polarity, and its electro- 
magnetic properties, become more and more identified 
with sex. Broadly speaking, the male sex represents 
the dominant, active, aggressive, positive qualities, and 
the female sex, the negative, passive, receptive qual- 
ities. Individuals exhibit all shades, grades and mix- 
tures of these general sexual characteristics. Attrac- 
tion between the sexes depends upon the innate ten- 



THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OP POOD 411 

deney and desire to equalize unbalanced or disturbed 
polarity. 

Exaggerated positive or negative conditions physic- 
ally, mentally, morally, spiritually or psychically tend 
to create disease on the respective planes of being. 
Physical disease, as we have explained in other chap- 
ters, is always accompanied by a predominance of the 
electro-magnetically negative elements and forces. 

Foods, medicines, suggestions and all other kinds of 
therapeutic treatment exert on the individual subjected 
to them a positive or negative influence. It is there- 
fore of the greatest importance that the physician and 
every one who wishes to live in harmony with Nature 's 
laws should understand this all-important question of 
magnetic polarity. 

Very interesting aspects of this problem have been 
treated in a thoroughly rational and scientific manner 
in a remarkable book entitled "The Great Psycholog- 
ical Crime," which is the second volume in the Har- 
monic Series, published by the Indo-American Book 
Co., 5705-5711 West Lake St., Chicago. 

The anonymous author says on pages 280-281 : 

* ' Those who reach the negative condition of medium- 
ship through the process of dietetics alone represent a 
very considerable number of those who afterwards be- 
come known either as mediums or as insane. Diet has 
its most direct and positive effects upon the purely 
physical organism of the individual. 

* * Positive foods and medicines have the general effect 
of producing positive magnetic conditions within the 
physical organism. Negative foods, on the other hand, 
as well as negative medicines, produce the opposite or 
negative condition of the physical organism. 

"Generally speaking, a strictly vegetable diet of any 



412 NATURAL DIETETICS 

kind is, comparatively, a magnetically negative diet. 
While this is a scientific fact, it is also true that vege- 
tables differ very widely in the degree of their positive 
and negative properties, qualities and effects. 

"For instance: As a general proposition, all vege- 
tables which develop under the soil (such as the potato, 
the turnip, the radish, the carrot and the beet), are the 
most positive (or least negative) vegetable foods 
known. Those which grow upon endogenous plants, 
generally speaking, are second in order. Those which 
grow upon exogenous trees, with some exceptions, are 
third in order, while those which grow on vines take 
rank among the most negative foods. There are excep- 
tions among all these various classes. 

"A strictly meat diet is the most positive magnetic 
diet known. While the meats of different animals pos- 
sess radically different degrees of positive force and 
magnetic energy, it is, nevertheless, true that, gener- 
ally speaking, meats of all kinds are more positive than 
vegetables. 

* ' With the simple principle of food values in mind it 
will not be difficult to understand that diet is a most 
important factor in the development of the positive or 
negative magnetic condition of the physical organism. 
In like measure it has its effects upon the relation of 
the individual to his spiritual environment. 

"Solitude has the effect of producing a mentally 
negative condition. This is because of the natural 
tendency to mental abstraction which follows from soli- 
tude. Man upon the physical plane is eminently a 
social being. If deprived of the society of his kind hia 
mind involuntarily seeks companionship in the realms 
of thought. This habit of contemplation without defi- 
nite purpose produces a psychically negative condition. 



THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OP FOOD 413 

"Fasting is, primarily, a purely physical process, al- 
though it has a strong reflex action upon the mind also. 
When the stomach is supplied with food all the organs 
of the physical body related to the processes of diges- 
tion, distribution, assimilation and secretion are in a 
state of involuntary activity. The physical organism 
is then busy with the renovating and renewing proc- 
esses. When, through the process of fasting, all the 
nutriment supplied to the system has been disposed of, 
the physical organism has nothing more to do in its 
own behalf but wait for more food. During this period 
of waiting the internal organism of the physical body 
is in a negative or passive condition. It then becomes 
a magnet which strongly attracts those upon the spir- 
itual plane, and (unless the mind is properly schooled 
and on guard) opens the door to mediumistic control." 
(A magnetically negative condition.) 

When I first read the above quoted classifications of 
foods, according to their magnetic properties, the ques- 
tion arose in my mind, What causes the magnetic polar- 
ity of foods and their positive or negative influence on 
body and mind? In the contents of the following 
chapter I shall endeavor to answer this question. 



CHAPTER X 
POLAEITY OF FOODS AND MEDICINES 

Two principal factors determine the positive and 
negative qualities of foods and medicines : 

First, the character and unimpaired activity of the 
life elements inherent in the foods; second, the contents 
of the food materials in positive and negative elements. 

We shall now consider separately these two factors 
in polarity. 

This interesting subject of polarity, of the positive 
and negative qualities of foods and medicines, is inti- 
mately interwoven with many other problems of die- 
tetics, as for instance, with the meat and protein ques- 
tion. An understanding of polarity will help us decide 
whether it is wise to exclude the "dairy products" 
entirely from the vegetarian dietary. 

Many extremists condemn the use of milk, cheese 
and eggs, insisting that only products of the soil should 
enter into a vegetarian diet. The fruitarians exclude 
from their "ideal" diet even those positive vegetables 
which grow in and near the ground, claiming that these 
coarsen the body. "We have repeatedly called atten- 
tion to the dangers of such extreme practices. 

The Proteid Question 

About sixty years ago, Justus von Liebich, the great 
German chemist, called attention to the fact that the 

414 



POLARITY OP FOODS AND MEDICINES 415 

fleshy tissues of the animal and human body consist 
almost entirely of proteid material. The medical pro- 
fession at once jumped to the conclusion that in order 
to ** build up" the human body, large amounts of pro- 
teid foods must be taken. This erroneous assumption 
is still ruling the dietetics of orthodox medicine. The 
discoveries and resulting theories of J. von Liebich 
seemed to find confirmation in the diet statistics gath- 
ered by prominent physicians. 

Prof. Voit, of Munchen, found that the average daily 
dietary of the working people contained 118 grams 
proteid, 50 grams fat and 500 grams of hydrocar- 
bonates. He and the medical profession took it for 
granted that because this was the composition of the 
average diet, it must also be the right one. They did 
not stop to consider that people in general might be 
living on abnormal diet combinations, though the fact 
that disease is almost universal and health the excep- 
tion might furnish reason for thinking that something 
was wrong with dietetic habits. 

The proteid advocates should also consider that ani- 
mals in freedom and on pasture build their splendid 
bodies on nutritious grasses, which are exceedingly 
poor in proteids. Milk also, which Nature has pro- 
vided as a perfect food for the growing animal and 
infant, contains a very low percentage of proteid ; while 
meat contains from 20 to 25 per cent of nitrogenous 
elements, milk contains only about 4 per cent. 

Proteid being essentially a tissue-building material, 
one would think that the young and growing animal, 
while building new tissues, would require much more 
proteid than the adult. The latest revelations of chem- 
ical analyses and physiological experiments show that 
in the adult only 4 per cent of the daily food is used 



416 NATURAL DIETETICS 

for tissue-building, while 96 per cent is required for 
the production of heat and energy. 

Instead of being the most desirable food element, we 
have learned that proteids are the danger foods, that 
in the digestive processes they produce the poisonous 
acids and alkaloids, which are the underlying causes of 
the majority of human ailments. 

These facts have induced vegetarians as a class and 
many diet reformers among physicians to become the 
bitter enemies of proteid and to run into the extreme 
of proteid starvation. By many of these extremists, 
proteid foods of all forms are avoided and, as suggested 
above, even the dairy products tabooed. 

They must admit, however, that proteid foods, espe- 
cially of the animal varieties, create more heat and 
energy in the system, measured in calories, than the 
vegetable carbohydrates (starches and sugars) despite 
the fact that proteids are tissue builders rather than 
heat producers. 

E/ubner, the German food chemist, calls this extraor- 
dinary display of energy "the specilBc dynamic effect 
of proteid. ' ' He and other scientists try to explain this 
by saying that the display of energy incident upon the 
assimilation of proteid food marks the effort of vital 
force to break down and burn up the waste products of 
proteid materials. They distinctly claim animal pro- 
teid contains much less inherent heat-and-energy-pro- 
ducing qualities than the vegetable proteid and carbo- 
hydrates. They assume that all the heat and energy 
in the animal and human body is derived from the sun 
energy, stored up in the vegetable kingdom. In the 
plants, they say, we eat "sun energy." 

In order to avoid misrepresentation and to give a 
fair idea of these representatives of extreme vegetari- 



POLABITT OP FOODS AND MEDICINES 417 

anism, I shall translate as closely as possible, some 
passages from a work of Dr. M. Bireher-Benner, en- 
titled, ' * Grundzlige der Ernahrungs-Therapie." 

Beginning on page 25 he says: "This transforma- 
tion of sunlight into chemical energy takes place in 
those vegetable cells which contain chlorophyll. 
(Chlorophyll is the element which imparts the green 
color to fruits and vegetables.) What we call proteid, 
starches and fats, are merely different forms of sun 
energy transformed into chemical energy, and these 
foodstuffs contain nothing more than sun energy when 
we consume them in Jflesh foods. 

(We shall prove later on that the assumption ex- 
pressed in the preceding paragraph is erroneous, that 
something more than sun energy is stored in the tissues 
of animal bodies. — Ed.) 

"What happens in the vegetable cell? Out of the 
air, the plant absorbs carbon dioxide. This is a com- 
bination of one part carbon and two parts oxygen. To 
part these elements requires a great expenditure of 
energy and this work of separation is performed by 
light or sun energy. The oxygen, which has been torn 
away fifom the carbon, escapes into the air and serves 
as food for the animal and human kingdoms, while the 
carbon in the plant enters into combination with other 
elements absorbed from the earth and from the air. 

(These newly formed molecules absorb a great deal 
of the light, heat and energy which have been used in 
their formation, just as the ice molecule in its forma- 
tion absorbs cold. This heat or cold which has become 
latent in the plant or ice molecule is liberated .again 
when the plant is consumed by fire or when the ice is 
melted by warmth. — Ed.) 

"Oxydation is nothing else than the reunion of car- 



418 NATURAL DIETETICS 

bon in the plant molecule with the oxygen of the air. 
Result, carbon dioxide, which again serves as food for 
plants. 

"Sub energy also causes the separation of water into 
hydrogen and oxygen and this also involves a great 
expenditure of energy, part of which becomes latent in 
the newly formed molecules of the vegetable cell. When 
in the digestive processes, carbon and oxygen, which 
had been parted in the formation of the vegetable 
molecule, again unite, eiiergj' is liberated. This storage 
of energy during the building up processes (anabolism) 
and the liberation of it in the tearing down processes 
(catabolism) resembles the accumulation of energy in 
the wound spring and its liberation while unwinding. 

''On the other hand accumulation of sun energy 
takes place in the plant through the combination of 
carbon with nitrogen and hydrogen. These elements 
strongly oppose union, but sun energy binds them 
together. This opposition between nitrogen and car- 
bon is so great that artificially it can be overcome only 
in the highest known temperatures created in the elec- 
tric light arc. (Just as it takes a great deal of heat 
to unite two pieces of steel. — Ed.'s Note.) 

"What enormous amounts of energy must be stored 
in these nitrogen-carbon-hydrogen-combinations is in- 
dicated by the fact that the most powerful explosives, 
acetylene, dynamite and nitro-glycerine, are combina- 
tions of these elements. (This explains the "specific 
dynamic force" of proteid, for the basic element of 
proteids is nitrogen. — Ed.'s Note.) 

"Thus, we see how streams of energy, which the sun 
sends to our earth, are transmuted into chemical 
energy ; then food is sun energy, and living beings are 
indeed children of the sun. 



POLARITY OF FOODS AND MEDICINES 419 

"In the vegetable kingdom only, the springs are 
wound which drive the mechanism of life. Vegetarians 
derive their energy direct from Nature, while meat- 
eaters obtain energy indirectly and in a weakened 
form. ' ' 

All this reasoning seems plausible and has served 
well the advocates of a strictly vegetarian diet, but 
unfortunately for the learned doctor as well as for his 
ultra vegetarian and materialistic friends their argu- 
ments are based on false premises and therefore un- 
tenable. 

The fallacy of their reasoning is due to the fact 
that the energies at work in the vegetable kingdom 
are not, by any means, the highest expression of force 
on this planet. 

On the contrary, the vital forces animating our 
planetary body manifest in four differing ranges or 
ratios of vibratory activity. 

This explains why there is a quality of energy in 
animal food which cannot be derived from vegetable 
food, and this something is the animal life principle, 
animal magnetism, or in other words, a higher and 
more refined range of vibratory activity than those ani- 
mating the lower kingdoms. 

Polarity and the Life Elements 

In every higher sphere, matter is made to vibrate to 
higher ratios of vibratory motion and moulded into 
compounds of increasing complexity. 

Four distinct life elements or "ranges of vibration" 
control the four great kingdoms of life. The lowest 
plane is controlled by the electro-magnetic life prin- 
ciple; the next higher or vegetable kingdom by th« 



420 NATURAL DIETETICS 

vito-chemical life element; the still higher animal king- 
dom is animated by the spiritual or animal life element, 
and the highest or human plane by the soul life ele- 
ment. 

On the lowest plane, the electro-magnetic life element 
binds together the atoms into the simple inorganic com- 
pounds of the mineral plane. 

In the vegetable kingdom, the vito-chemical life ele- 
ment, by the aid of sun energy, builds up the simple 
compounds of minerals and water into the refined 
and complex living molecules of organic vegetable 
matter. 

The elements of earth, air (sun), fire and water thus 
organized or made alive in the vegetable cell by the 
vito-chemical life element furnish the foods for the 
next higher animal and human planes. 

The spiritual life element governing the animal 
kingdom seizes upon the living matter of the vege- 
table plane and refines, organizes and vivifies i!> 
to still higher potencies of vital force and creative 
energy. 

To recapitulate, the four great kingdoms of earth 
life are animated and governed by four distinct life 
elements which ^re equivalent to progressively higher 
and more refined ranges of vibratory activity. Increase 
of vibratory activity means increase of kinetic or work- 
ing energy. 

These facts in natural science explain why, in every 
higher kingdom, molecules become more complex and 
possessed of greater potential energy. Since the build- 
ing of atoms into molecules involves the absorption of 
the energy which builds into that which it is building, 
every additional atom in the molecule means additional 
inherent energy. 



POLAEITY OF FOODS AND MEDICINES 421 

We can now understand why Dr. B. B. says on page 
47 : "In the third chapter, we have discussed the dif- 
ferent forms of energy and the laws which govern them. 
Having studied the transmutation of sun energy into 
vegetable substance, we understand the meaning of the 
sentence, 'Therefore, in plants we eat sun energy.' 
Without hesitancy we may add to this that in flesh 
food also we eat sun energy, for the animal body builds 
itself from animal food without measurable additions 
of new forms of energy. The foods of man are derived 
from the narrow confines of the vegetable and animal 
kingdom and are transformed sun energy and chemical 
energy." 

Still he finds himself confronted by the fact that 
animal proteid when taken as food, creates in the 
human organism an extraordinary amount of heat and 
energy, much more than equal amounts of starches and 
carbohydrates, in spite of the fact that proteid is 
looked upon rather as tissue building material than as 
a heat and energy producer. 

The doctor tries to explain this discrepancy between 
theory and actual fact in an ingenious manner. On 
page 37, he claims, "That the extraordinary manifesta- 
tion of heat and energy following the injection of pro- 
teid is not due to the potential energy of the proteid, 
but that it represents the energy expended by the 
organism in its endeavor to oxydize and remove pro- 
teid waste matter." 

Food analysis proves, however, that animal protein, 
fat and carbohydrates rank higher in digestibility 
and fuel value, measured in calories, per pound, than 
the same food elements taken from the vegetable king- 
dom. In making these calculations it must be taken 
into consideration that animal foods contain much 



422 NATURAL DIETETICS 

more water than cereals, nuts and legumes. The 
figures must be based on water-free protein fats and 
carbohydrates. 

A calorie is the amount of heat which would raise 
the temperature of one kilogram of water 1° C. or, 
what is nearly the same thing, one pound of water 
4° F. 

The superior fuel value of animal foods flatly con- 
tradicts the position of Dr. B. B. and others who claim 
they are devitalized food products, created by second- 
ary sun forces liberated in animal bodies bj'- the diges- 
tion of vegetable food products. 

Our knowledge of the four life elements solves the 
problem and explains why animal food should possess 
greater values in heat and energy and why it should 
have a more tonic effect on the human organism than 
purely vegetable products. 

From the trend of this article it does not follow that 
we advocate a meat diet. We resort to flesh foods only 
in cases of extreme physical and mental negativity, in 
order to build up the positive animal qualities which 
have become depleted, below the normal. In such 
cases, we have frequently found meat of considerable 
value. 

For the reasons brought forth in this chapter, we do 
advocate, in the daily dietary, a liberal use of the dairy 
products. In the food products of the live animal, we 
partake of the kinetic energy of the animal life element 
without consuming at the same time the poisonous 
waste matter of the animal carcass. 

"What we commonly call animal magnetism is the 
spiritual life element permeating and animating the 
animal kingdom. This subtle but potent force, which 
if; absent in the products of the vegetable kingdom, is 



POLARITY OF POODS AND MEDICINES 423 

presented to us in the most available form, unimpaired 
by cooking, in the dairy products. 

The Second Factor of Positive Polarity 

The second factor in the causation of positive and 
negative polarity of foods and medicines lies in their 
contents or percentages of positive and negative ele- 
ments. Aside from the influence of the life elements, 
the positivity of a certain food or medicine depends 
upon its richness in the positive, alkaline mineral ele- 
ments, in the live organic (vitamine) form. The per- 
centages of the positive and negative elements in the 
principal foods and food classes are shown in the 
"Table of Food Analysis," on pages 430 and 431, 
of this volume. A study of this table confirms what 
we have constantly asserted and reiterated in this vol- 
ume, namely, that the first four groups of our food 
classification, the starches, sugars, fats and proteins, 
are made up entirely of electro-magnetically negative, 
acid-producing elements, and are therefore negative, 
and disease-producing in their effects upon the human 
body, while the fruits, vegetables and other food prod- 
ucts of the fifth (mineral) group are exceedingly rich 
in the positive mineral elements and poor in the nega- 
tive acid-forming elements, and therefore have a posi- 
tive, health-producing effect upon the system. 

We will now consider in how far "positiveness" and 
"normal function" are dependent on the positive min- 
eral salts in food and drink. 

Iron 

Iron In the form of hemoglobin is all-important as 
a carrier of oxygen from the lungs into the tissues of 



424 NATURAL DIETETICS . 

the body. Combustion is impossible without oxygen, 
and digestion is a slow process of combustion. With- 
out combustion there can be no heat production nor 
any cremation and elimination of waste products. 
Furthermore, it has been discovered that iron and 
other minerals moving rapidly in a salty solution 
(sodium-chlorid in the blood) produce electric and 
magnetic currents. Therefore is iron one of the most 
important positive working elements in the body. 

Sodium 

Carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen are the four 
unstable, negative, gaseous elements in the human 
body. Three of these — carbon, oxygen and hydrogen 
— make up the various fuel materials, such as fats, oils, 
starches and sugars. They are to the body what coal 
is to the furnace ; they liberate heat and energy. Simi- 
lar to coal, they give off, in the process of combustion, 
a great deal of carbonic acid or carbon-dioxide (CO2), 
and if this poisonous gas is allowed to accumulate it 
will extinguish the fire in the furnace or the life in 
the body. 

Largely on sodium, a positive alkaline mineral ele- 
ment, depends the elimination from the body of the 
carbon-dioxide. It accomplishes this in the following 
manner: Sodium circulates in the body as di-sodium 
phosphate; that is, in molecules which contain one 
atom of phosphorus to two atoms of sodium. This 
combination, however, is a loose one. One atom of 
sodium to one of phosphorus forms a stable union, but 
the secofid atom of sodium is only a loose addition. As 
soon as this unstable sodium atom finds a more powerful 
attraction it leaves the phosphorus and joins the 



POLARITY OP POODS AND MEDICINES 425 

stronger affinity. Such an affinity for sodium is carbon- 
dioxide (COj). 

Tliese two, wlien they meet in the blood, form sodium- 
carbonate, but this union also is not a true and lasting 
one, for when the pair reach the lungs, the airy COa 
deserts its mate and passes through expiration into the 
open air. The sodium now reunites with its old friend 
phosphorus, but on its travels back into the body, 
repeats the same trick when it meets again with CO,. 

Thus are enacted down at the very foundation of 
this universe, in the world of atoms, the loves, affinities, 
unions and separations, satisfactions and tragedies of 
the loves and hatreds of human beings. 

If sodium is lacking in the blood, CO2 accumulates 
and gradually asphyxiates the processes of combustion 
on which depend digestion, reduction of waste and 
heat production. This becomes visible outwardly by 
loss of appetite, malnutrition, loss of weight, coldness 
of hands and feet, blue color of lips, nails and skin; 
in fact, by the prominent symptoms of anemia, per- 
nicious anemia and consumption. 

In other cases partial oxydation of food materials 
and waste products, Tinder the influence of carbon- 
dioxide poisoning, causes fatty degeneration. The food 
materials, instead of being turned into heat and energy, 
are changed into fatty deposits. 

Just as insufficient draft in the furnace turns coal 
into partially consumed clinkers, so in the body partial 
combustion turns the starchy foods into fat, instead of 
reducing them into heat and energy. Therefore it hap- 
pens that the excessive consumption of starchy food, 
lack of exercise and fresh air, causes fatty degenera- 
tion. People thus afflicted often complain: "I eat so 
little, yet everything seems to turn into fat." Thii 



426 NATURAL DIETETICS 

is literally true for the reason just stated. The cure 
in such cases consists in prompt elimination of the car- 
bon-dioxide and better oxydation, by increased mus- 
cular activity, by fresh air, deep breathing and by the 
increased consumption of sodium in the organic form, 
in fruits and vegetables. 

Thus we are presented with the paradoxical fact that 
carbonic acid poisoning may cause, according to indi- 
vidual constitutional peculiarities, in one person, de- 
struction of tissues by pernicious anemia or tubercu- 
losis, and in another person an excess of fatty deposits. 
Ill fact, many cases of tuberculosis are preceded by 
fatty degeneration. This connection between the two 
is now plain. The element, lithium, though present in 
the body in small quantities only, performs similar 
acid-binding and eliminating functions to those of 

sodium. yx . X 

CaJcium (Lime) 

Lime, in connection with silicon, phosphorus and 
magnesium makes up over 50 per cent of the bony 
structures of the body; it imparts textile strength to 
all the tissues. If lime, silicon and magnesium are 
lacking in the daily dietary, rachitis and scorbutic 
diseases, scrofula, tendency to bleeding (hasmophelia), 
osteomalecia, decay of teeth and diseases of the hair 
will be the inevitable results. Like other positive alka- 
line mineral elements, it also serves as a neutralizer 
and eliminator of poisonous acids. The action of 

Magnesium, 

another one of tlie alkaline elements, is similar to that 
of sodium and lime as an eliminator of destructive 
acids. It is also concerned in the production of electro- 
magnetic currents in the blood. 



POLABITY OP FOODS AND MEDICINES 427 

The Belationship of Positive Alkaline Salts to Nega- 
tive Proteid Materials 

All proteid foods are composed of the unstable nega- 
tive gaseous elements, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, 
nitrogen, and of the negative earthy elements, phos- 
phorus and sulphur. Being very rich in acid-produc- 
ing nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur, these foods form 
in the processes of digestion a great deal of uric, phos- 
phoric and sulphuric acids. These acids, if not 
promptly neutralized by the positive alkaline mineral 
bases (especially sodium), accumulate in the system 
and actually destroy the living tissues. To make this 
clearer, for instance, if sodium is lacking in the blood, 
the destructive acids satisfy their chemical desire or 
affinity for alkaline elements by leeching them from 
bones and muscles, and thereby cause the weakening 
and breaking down of these tissues. 

This fact is strikingly illustrated in the English 
"Banting Cure" for the reduction of fat and flesh. 
This regime consists mainly of an excessive lean meat 
diet with the exclusion of fats, starchy foods and 
sugar. Such a purely proteid diet produces large 
amounts of uric and sulphuric acids and is deficient in 
the acid-binding alkaline bases (sodium and magne- 
sium) ; the acids, therefore, break do"\vn and destroy 
not only the fat, but also the muscular tissues. Reduc- 
tion of fat and flesh by such means, however, is a de- 
structive disease process. This explains why people 
undergoing such cures become weak and nervous and 
develop various forms of uric acid diseases, such as 
rheumatism, heart disease, calculi (stones) in kidneys, 
bladder, etc. 

We can now understand why people living almost 



428 NATURAL DIETETICS 

exclusively on "strengthening" meats and eggs grow 
livid and thin, while the emigrant peasant girl, reared 
on coarse bread, roots and vegetables, is plump and 
strong, and why she loses her milk-and-blood com- 
plexion after a few years of American "high living." 

Potassinm 

This positive, alkaline mineral element serves also 
as a neutralizer and eliminator of acids, alkaloids and 
ptomaines. It is to the muscular tissues what lime is 
to the bony structures, that is, it forms the solid basis 
of the fleshy tissues, and imparts to them textile 
strength. 

This brief survey of the positive mineral elements 
and their functions in the body now explains whj' 
foods rich in these "organic salts" exert a positive 
influence on the human organism and its functions. 

It is apparent now why an excess of proteid and 
starchy foods in the daily dietary and a simultaneous 
shortage of mineral salts will inevitably clog the sys- 
tem with waste matter and destructive, poisonous 
acids, alkaloids and ptomaines. 



CHAPTER XI 

CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS ACCORDING TO 
THEIR ELECTRO-MAGNETIC QUALITIES 

(See diagrams on pages 430-431.) 

CLASS I 

Animal Foods — ^Positive 

Life Elements: Electro-magnetic (mineral king- 
dom) ; Vito-chemical (vegetable kingdom) ; Animal 
(animal kingdom). 

Milk and Eed, Arterial Blood — The Only Normal (Standard) 
Food Combinations in Nature 

Properties : Flesh Building ; Blood, Bone and Nerve 
Building; Heating, Acid-Binding and Eliminating. 

Milk and red blood are electro-magnetically positive 
foods because, in addition to the mineral and vegetable 
life elements, they are animated by the animal life 
element and because, in proportion to the negative ele- 
ments, they contain fairly large amounts of positive 
mineral elements. 

Eggs 

Properties: Heating; Flesh Building; Acid-Form- 
ing. 

Eggs contain large amounts of highly organized fats 
and proteid materials and, in proportion to these, run 
rather low in the positive mineral elements, especially 
in the important acid binding sodium. They therefore

tend to produce, in the processes of digestion, large 
amounts of acids, alkaloids, ptomaines and noxious 
gases. This explains why ** stuffing" with eggs fails 
to cure consumption. This disease, as well as other 
wasting diseases, is made more incurable by unnatural 
food stuffing and by poisonous drugs. 

Storage eggs are especially prone to the formation 
of ptomaine poisoning. 

Though low in positive mineral elements, eggs are 
classed as positive because they are animated by the 
animal life element. They should be used sparingly, 
and always in conjunction with foods belonging to 
Group V (mineral elements). 

Flesh Foods 

Properties: Heating; Flesh Building; Acid-Form- 
ing. 

Comparative analyses of blood and the muscular 
parts of animals disclose the fact that, while blood 
is rich in sodium and iron, bloodless meat (boiled or 
roasted, as it is usually eaten) is very deficient in 
these elements and therefore negative and acid-pro- 
ducing. Potassium, the principal mineral element lq 
meat, serves as a solid basis for the unstable proteid 
materials of which flesh is composed. Meat-eaters, 
therefore, in order to be consistent, should, like car- 
niverous animals and primitive races, consume the 
blood as well as the flesh. The organic salts lacking in 
cooked meat have to be supplanted by the inorganic 
mineral table salt — hence the craving of the meat-eater 
for salt. 

The flesh of sea fish, living in water saturated vnth 
positive mineral elements (iron, lime, sodium, lithium, 
chloride, magnesium, etc.), is richer in alkaline mineral 



CLASSIFICATION OP POODS 433 

elements, and therefore more positive, than that of 
fresh water fish and the meat of land animals. 

Dr. Lahman and others mention the fact that the 
flesh of wild animals is much richer in organic salts 
than that of domestic animals, which is easily explained 
when we consider that wild animals live on nutritious, 
uncultivated grasses, rich in mineral salts, while do- 
mestic animals are raised and fattened only too often 
on distillery, brewery and kitchen slops, or other de- 
vitalized food materials deprived of their mineral 
elements. 

CLASS n 

Leafy, Juicy VegetalDles which Grow In and Near the 
Ground — Positive 

Life Elements: Electro-magnetic (mineral king- 
dom) ; Vito-chemical (vegetable kingdom). 

Properties: Blood, Bone and Nerve Building; Acid- 
Binding and Eliminating; Medicinal Qualities. 

A survey of our analytical table (pages 430-431) 
shows that the foods belonging to this group are much 
richer in the positive mineral salts than the animal 
foods; still, vegetables are not as positive in their 
effects upon the human body as the animal foods be- 
cause they are animated by a lower (vito chemical) 
life element. However, they are all-important for the 
maintenance of health, because their positive alkaline 
mineral elements are the most effective neutralizers 
and eliminators of the poisonous acids, alkaloids and 
ptomaines produced by the ingestion and digestion of 
animal foods. 

The highly nitrogenous meat diet ia not nearly so 
harmful when properly combined with a liberal amount 
of green vegetables, as is customary in European coun- 



434 NATURAL DIETETICS 

tries. It is the all-meat-potat9-wliite-bread-coffee-and- 
pie American diet which makes for the prevalence of 
uric acid diseases, indigestion, constipation, appendi- 
citis, cancer and nervous ailments. The foods belong- 
ing to this group, on account of their great richness in 
the positive, alkaline, mineral elements are the real 
blood, bone and nerve builders, as explained in other 
chapters. 

Roots and Tubers 

Life Elements: Electro-magnetic (mineral king- 
dom); Vito-chemieal (vegetable kingdom). 

Properties; Heating; Blood, Bone and Nerve Build- 
ing; Flesh Building; Acid-Binding and Eliminating. 

Carrots and beets are very rich in dextroses and 
glucoses, which, next to the fniit sugars, are the purest 
and finest of natural sugars. They are therefore valu- 
able fuel materials. Most of the roots run rather low 
in starches and proteids, but high in the positive, alka- 
line mineral elements, which makes them good anti- 
dotes to the poisonous acids, alkaloids and ptomaines 
produced by the highly nitrogenous animal, leguminous 
and cereal foods. 

Some of the roots have valuable medicinal qualities, 
as explained in Chapter III (pages 25 and 26). 

Potatoes run low in proteids (about 2 per cent), but 
fairly high in starches (about 20 to 25 per cent). Our 
analytical table shows that they are not nearly as rich 
in these elements as the cereals. However, they rank 
higher than the cereals in the positive mineral ele- 
ments, especially in lime and potassium. It is prob- 
ably for this reason that they are so well liked by 
children who need a great deal of these tissue-building 
elements.

Properties: Heating (according to their contents in

Berries, in general, run very liigh in the positive 
mineral elements and very low in the negative starches 
and proteids. Some of them, like the blackberries, 
raspberries, blueberries and huckleberries, are rich in 
highly organized fruit sugars. Their juices contain 
valuable medicinal elements. They are animated by 
the vito-chemical life element. 

Because they are comparatively much richer in the

electro-magnetically positive in their effects upon the 
human body.

To this group belong all the hardy acid and sub-acid 
fruits, such as" lemons, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, 
peaches, apples, plums, pears, cherries, pineapples, etc. 
The foods of this group are animated by the vito-chem- 
ical life element. They run from medium high to high 
in the positive mineral elements and very low in the 
negative starches and proteids. They also exert a posi-

tive influence on the organism because they are natural 
laxatives, cholagogues, purifiers and antiseptics. Their 
natural sugars are the most easily combustible of all 
heat and energy producing foods. They are therefore 
the finest natural tonics and stimulants. Distilled in 
Nature's own laboratory', their juices are absolutely 
pure and the most delicious drinks for man — they are 
indeed the nectar of the gods. 

CLASS V 
Sweet Alkaline Fruits — ^Medium Positive 

Life Elements: Electro-magnetic (mineral king- 
dom); Vito-chemical (vegetable kingdom). 

Properties: Heating (according to their contents 
in sugars) ; Blood, Bone and Nerve Building ; Acid- 
Binding and Eliminating; Medicinal Qualities. 

To this group belong the melon family, cucumbers 
and grapes. The foods of this group rank fairly high 
in the positive alkaline mineral elements and very low 
in the negative starches and proteids, but they contain 
large amounts of fruit sugars, which are magnetically 
negative. Therefore, we rank them as medium posi- 
tive. The juices of these fruits have highly medicinal 
qualities. They are splendid natural laxatives and 
purifiers. Their highly organized sugars are the rich- 
est of fuel materials and natural stimulants and tonics. 

Figs and dates may also be placed in this class, as 
they are similar in their electro-magnetic and medicinal 
qualities to the foods of this group. 

CLASS VI 
Nuts — Negative 

Life Elements: Electro-magnetic (mineral king- 
dom); Vito-chemical (vegetable kingdom). 



CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS 437 

Properties : Heating ; Flesh Building ; Acid Forming. 

A glance at our analytical table tells us why these 
foods are negative. They are exceedingly rich in pro- 
teids, fats and carbohydrates, but rank very low in 
positive organic salts. This explains why "nuts crave 
salt;" why so many people find nuts "indigestible;" 
why the "Fruits and Nuts" idealists run physically 
and mentally into negative conditions. 

CLASS vn 

Legumes — Negative 

Life Elements: Electro-magnetic (mineral king- 
dom); Vito-chemical (vegetable kingdom). 

Properties: Heating; Flesh Building; Acid-Form- 
ing. 

Our tables show that the foods of this group run veiy 
low in positive mineral elements, while they are exceed- 
ingly rich in the negative, starchy and proteid ele- 
ments. In other words, they are very rich in the acid- 
producing starches and proteids and very poor in the 
acid-binding and eliminating alkaline mineral elements. 
Therefore, if not properly combined with adequate 
amounts of juicy fruits and green vegetables, they may 
become as dangerous to health as meats.

All grains are exceedingly negative. While they 
contain large amounts of proteid and starchy mate- 



438 NATURAL DIETETICS 

rials, they are very poor in the positive mineral salts, 
and what little they possess of these important elements 
is stored in the hulls and in the dark outer layers. In 
order to comply with the popular demand for white 
flour and rice, these outer layers are removed in the 
milling processes, and thus the grains and rice are 
robbed of the most valuable blood and bone-making 
elements. Bran and rice polish are therefore exceed- 
ingly rich in mineral salts and very valuable foods for 
our domestic animals. The latter wax strong and fat 
on the "refuse" of the mills, rich in organic salts, while 
the farmer grows thin and dyspeptic on his "fine white 
flour." Oriental nations use unpolished rice, which is 
much richer in flavor and better fitted to sustain life 
than our refined but impoverished mill products. On 
pages 12 and 13 we have explained how the refining 
and polishing robs the grains and rice of their vita- 
mines. 

Conclusions 

Let us see now whether, after this brief survey of 
our food tables we can explain some of the mysteries 
and perplexities of dietetics. We can understand now 
why our American vegetarians, living largely upon 
devitalized leguminous and grain products, with a 
liberal allowance of nuts, peanuts and olive oil, often 
fare worse than people living on the mixed diet, and 
become "warning examples" to the meat-eaters. 

Highly dangerous to those who are already negative 
and sensitive is also the "fruit and nut" diet. It is 
only a naturally very positive "animal" constitution 
that can afford to live on such a negative and highly 
refining diet. Many "fruit and nut" enthusiasts ex- 
pressly exclude from their dietary all things growing 



CLASSIFICATION OP FOODS 439 

in and under the ground, and the dairy products, "be- 
cause they are coarsening and tend to develop the 
animal nature." They forget, in their endeavor to 
make, by the diet route, short cuts to masterhood and 
Godhood, that in these strenuous physical, material 
surroundings we need in our daily business a consid- 
erable amount of the positive animal magnetic qual- 
ities. 

Negative food combinations, excessive fasting, con- 
centrating in the silence, yogi breathing exercises, sub- 
jective psychism and other subjective practices lead 
many misguided idealists and enthusiasts into physical 
and mental breakdown and not a few into abnormal 
psychism, obsession, and insanity. 

It is a pity that so many fake occultists use the pure 
and simple teachings of common-sense German 
"Nature Cure" as a bait and a cloak for pernicious 
mystical pretensions. 

These charlatans know full well that people are so 
hungry for the simple truths and efficient methods of 
Nature Cure that they will swallow with them any 
amount of dangerous occult impositions. 

A look at the mineral constituents of grain and rice 
answers effectively the common argument of the anti- 
vegetarian, "Look at your vegetarian nations in the 
Orient, the Hindoos and Chinese. Would you lower 
us to their physical and mental level by the adoption 
of a vegetarian diet?" 

Grains and rice rank lowest in the scale of negative 
foods, and it is therefore no wonder that people living 
almost exclusively on these staples should be sub- 
normal physically and mentall3\ No wonder they are 
no match for the bloody beefsteak-consuming Briton 
and German. 



440 NATURAL DIETETICS 

A rational vegetarian diet properly combined, con- 
sisting of dairy products, the positive vegetables, and 
the medium positive fruits, with just enough of starchy 
and proteid foods to supply the needs of the body for 
tissue building and fuel materials, will be found to be 
an ideal diet, fully sufficient to sustain health and 
strength under the most trying circumstances. 

We admit that there are cases of physical and nerv- 
ous breakdown in which magnetic conditions have 
become so negative that a meat diet is, at least tem- 
porarily, of great advantage to supply the lack of 
animal magnetism. The animal magnetism attached 
to flesh foods, however, is only borrowed, and is con- 
taminated by the poisonous waste matter of the dead 
animal carcass. Therefore, we have seen people cured 
by the Salisbury raw meat diet, out of nervous pros- 
tration into rheumatism, heart disease, calculi in kid- 
neys and bladder, and into other uric acid diseases. 

Nature Cure follows a wiser plan. By its stimulat- 
ing methods of natural treatment and eliminating yet 
positive vegetarian diet, it puts the organism of the 
patient in such condition that it can generate its own 
positive magnetic forces. 



CHAPTER Xn 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DIGESTION 

All that we can do is to give the general outlines of 
food selection; the details and individual application 
must be worked out personally. No two organisms are 
just alike, and their requirements of food and drink 
diiier in quantity and quality from day to day, espe- 
cially in times of healing crises, under Nature Cure 
treatment. As the system changes, as the morbid 
materials are eliminated and new and normal tissues 
elaborated, the demands of the organism for certain 
food elements constantly change. Always, however, 
within the well-defined limits of natural food selection. 

Sometimes, for weeks, the patient will Kve almost 
entirely on celery and cabbage slaw; then he may de- 
velop a craving for tomatoes or carrots ; again he may 
exhibit a strong desire for certain fruits or nuts. 

Yf e always advise our patients to satisfy these crav- 
ings, which are especially peculiar to pregnancy and 
to periods of healing crises. They usually indicate a 
special need of the system for certain elements con- 
tained in these foods. 

Caprice and false appetite, however, must not be 
mistaken for ''natural craving," and even the latter 
should not be encouraged nor satisfied continually un- 
less it falls within the limits of natural food selection. 

Frequently, when we outline our system of dietetics 
to a new patient he exclaims in horror, **Why, I could 
not possibly eat this or that ; it would kill me, ' ' or the 

441 



4^ NATURAL DIETETICS 

complaint is, "I like those vegetables, but they do not 
like me; they cause great distress. Must I eat them 
in spite of this ? ' ' 

"No," we answer, **if such is the case, do not use 
them for the present ; you probably will use them after 
a while. Select at first, within the right limits, those 
fruits and vegetables which agree •with you. As your 
digestive organs become more normal you will add to 
your dietary, one after another, the luscious fruits and 
vegetables which now invariably cause pain, noxious 
gases and other symptoms of fermentation and indi- 
gestion." 

Present disease conditions were caused by a lack of 
these foods and the organic salts which they contain. 
A permanent cure can be produced only by the gradual 
adoption of the acid solving and acid binding foods, 
even if temporarily they create a commotion in the 
heavily encumbered organs and tissues. 

A thorough house-cleaning makes the dirt fly, and a 
thorough body cleansing in like manner stirs the 
poisons from their lairs, throws them into the circula- 
tion and brings them in contact with the living tissues, 
thus producing the acute aggravations of healing 
crises. But as we cannot have a clean house to live in 
without an occasional scouring so we cannot have a 
clean body without an occasional healing crisis. Wlien 
you begin to live on a natural diet, never mind the 
unpleasant disturbances, the capricious and alternating 
diarrhceas and constipations; they all belong to the 
game of house-cleaning and renovating. 

These changes and crises in the physical body are 
usually accompanied by great mental depression, nerv- 
ousness, irritability and melancholia. The old things 
are passing away and the new are coming in. It is the 



THE PSYCHOLOGY OP DIGESTION 443 

"vastation" of the old and the generation of the new 
man. Hence the queer feeling of "goneness," of "be- 
ing lost" and "homesickness" so often described by 
our patients in times of healing crises. 

Idiosyncrasies 

Idiosyncrasies are peculiar habits of body and mind. 
Most individuals exhibit some idiosyncrasy of eating. 
They cannot eat certain wholesome foods : one cannot 
eat an apple, another has an abhorrence for bread, still 
another becomes nauseated when eating sweets. 

Some of these peculiar traits are congenital and due 
to prenatal influences ; others are caused by eating too 
much or too often of a certain kind of food. Some- 
times they are due to mental or psychic neui'oses; in 
other instances disease conditions in the body revolt 
against a certain food or foods and create the idio- 
syncrasy. 

"Whatever the cause of these annoying dislikes and 
antipathies they can be overcome by improving the gen- 
eral condition of the organism — of the digestive organs 
in particular— and by auto-suggestion. 

Every evening before falling asleep, dwell upon the 
thought that the particular food which in the past has 
annoyed or distressed you, henceforth will perfectly 
agree with you. Say to yourself, " It is a good, whole- 
some and beautiful food ; it contains valuable elements 
of nutrition which I need in the economy of my body. 
There is no reason why I should not eat it. I will not 
allow my subconscious mind to tyrannize over my wak- 
ing consciousness. I am master of my feelings and my 
actions and not the plaything of pre-natal influences, 
foolish fear and morbid suggestions. I am the master 
of my body, mind and soull" 



444 NATUEAL DIETETICS 

Mental Dyspepsia 

Many people spoil the beneficial effects of the natural 
food regimen by excessive anxiety. No matter how 
good the advice and how carefully they follow it, they 
are always in fear of making mistakes about this food 
or that, of eating too much or eating too little; they 
ponder every morsel and worry over it ; then for a day 
or two they analyze their symptoms and try to deter- 
mine how this dish of gruel or that bit of cheese 
affected them. 

Such a mental attitude is weakening and destructive ; 
it will poison the most wholesome food and drink. 
Mental dyspepsia wiU inevitably express itself in phys- 
ical indigestion and malnutrition. 

To the best of your ability, make your food selec- 
tions: so much of the organic salt group, so much of 
proteid, and so much of carbohydrates. 

When an understanding of the rudiments of food 
chemistry has been acquired, the right selections are 
made without trouble and almost intuitively. "When 
the food is on the table, forget the problems of die- 
tetics, put all thoughts of business, work and study far 
from you and center your attention on pleasant things, 
on the joy of eating. 

With every morsel duly masticated swallow a happy 
thought or a pleasant emotion. Build castles in the 
air, be merry, have a friendly word and a happy smile 
for wife and child or for your chance acquaintance at 
the table d'hote. 

The medieval court jester, whose office it was to 
amuse the guests at feast or banquet, was a sensible 
and useful institution, much more worthy of patronage 
than poisonous pills and tonics. 



THE PSYCHOLOGY OP DIGESTION 445 

Worry, anxiety, anger, hatred and peevishness con- 
tract the blood vessels, inhibit the flow of digestive 
fluids and benumb nerve action. These destructive 
emotions actually sour the vital fluids as well as the 
mental disposition. On the other hand, nothing stimu- 
lates the circulation or the flow of gastric juices, or 
sweetens the secretions like cheerfulness, happiness and 
absolute confidence in the healing power within. 

If by chance you have made a mistake or committed 
an indiscretion in eating, do not make it worse by 
worrying over it. Take a good big dose of mental- 
magic tonic, one hundred grains of courage well 
shaken in a few ounces of cheerfulness. Thereby in- 
crease the flow of gastric secretions and say to your- 
self, ''Since I have eaten the forbidden fruit, I will 
not worry over it ; my innate powers of body, mind and 
soul will neutralize the bad effects. I will appropriate 
the good there is in it and eliminate the evil." 

Use forethought and seli-control to avoid mistakes, 
but when you have made them do not make the matter 
worse by fearthought. 



CHAPTER Xm 
MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 

Over-Eating- 

The most wholesome food becomes injurious when 
taken in excessive quantities. Whatever we cannot 
properly digest and assimilate ferments and decays, 
filling the system with waste matter and poisons. 
Many persons squander their vitality in eliminating 
noxious food ballast, and wonder why they are so weak 
in spite of a good appetite and rich foods. When the 
organs of digestion are continually overworked they 
weaken and are unable to convert the over-supply of 
food into the proper constituents for healthy blood 
and lymph ; waste matter accumulates, creating nox- 
ious gases and systemic poisons. Poisonous miasms 
thus contaminate the vital fluids, causing corruption 
and obstruction in organs and tissues, furnishing a 
luxurious soil for all kinds of parasites, germs and 
bacteria. 

In other chapters (III and IV) we have shown that 
we cannot eat and drink vital force — that it is inde- 
pendent of food, drink, medicines and tonics. There- 
fore, we cannot comprehend why so many physicians 
persist in stuffing the weak bodies of consumptives and 
other invalids with enormous quantities of food, under 
the mistaken impression that the patients can thus be 
strengthened and improved in health. Is it not self- 
evident that the stomach and bowels of these poor suf- 

446 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 447 

ferers are as feeble and as incapable of exertion as 
their arras and legs? 

If these sufferers could properly digest and assimi- 
late only a few eggs a day they would not be so weak 
and emaciated, but they are "stuffed" with as many 
eggs as they can possibly force down their throats. The* 
result is that the entire mass decays and ferments, 
spoiling that which was necessary together with the 
superfluous, and in that way doing more harm than 
good to the body. Would it not be more sensible to 
give no more than the digestive organs can take care 
of, to gradually increase the amount of food as stomach 
and intestines become more active and alive under the 
natural methods of treatment? 

Fasting Imperative in Acute Diseases 

In serious diseases and states of nervous and phys- 
ical prostration the expenditure of vital force is at a 
minimum, as is apparent from the extreme weakness 
and helplessness of the patient, therefore much less 
food is required than in times of healthful activity. 
Does not Nature herself protest against eating, by loss 
of appetite, nausea and vomiting? Nevertheless, 
though the patient himself objects to the enforced 
feeding, and his whole organism revolts against it, 
doctor and friends insist that he "must eat to keep 
up strength." "Sedatives" are given to paralyze the 
stomach into submission and down go chicken soup, 
eggs, beef tea and other tempting morsels. 

In acute febrile diseases feeding is not only useless 
but actually harmful, because in such conditions the 
normal activities of the organism, including the proc- 
esses of digestion and assimilation, are at a standstill. 
All efforts are concentrated on elimination; the stom- 



448 NATURAL DIETETICS 

ach and bowels are also called upon to assist in the 
general house cleaning. Instead of assimilating, they, 
too, are eliminating noxious poisons, which produce 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoeas and catarrhal excretions. 
The digestive organs normally act like a sponge, — they 
absorb the food elements from the digestive tract and 
transmit thera into the blood stream. In febrile dis- 
eases the process is reversed, — the sponge is being 
squeezed. It is throwing off morbid excretions, thus 
aiding the "cleansing crisis." As soon as food is given, 
this beneficial elimination through stomach and bowels 
is liindered and interrupted; as a consequence, the 
temperature rises and is followed by an aggravation 
of all symptoms. 

The danger lies not so much in under-feeding as in 
over-feeding. To one who dies from lack of food, 
thousands die from over-eating. If the truth were 
known, we sliould be surprised at the small amount 
of food required to keep the body in perfect condition. 

Cornaro, an Italian nobleman, when forty years of 
age, was declared by his doctors to be dying from the 
effects of dissipation. Instead of resigning himself to 
this fate, he determined to enter upon an experiment 
of his own. He cut his food supply down to a few 
ounces a day, and, before long, regained health and 
strength. At a hundred years of age he wrote a book 
in which he described his experiences and the wonder- 
ful effects of temperate living. 

The only safe guide in eating is "hunger, — not appe- 
tite;" true hunger is Nature's sign that more food is 
needed, and that the organism is in condition to take 
care of it. 

If these simple truths were more widely understood 
and patients in acute diseases were fasted instead of 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 449 

stuffed the death rate would decrease to an astonishing 
degree. 

To Salt or Not to Salt 

Like Banquo's ghost, this question will not down. 
Pro or con it has been discussed by every diet specialist 
and food reformer. Vegetarians say, "Don't;" meat 
eaters say, "Do." Both may be right. How can 
that be? 

Common inorganic table salt is chemically composed 
of sodium and chlorin. We call sodium and all other 
minerals organic when they enter into chemical com- 
binations with carbon or proteid compounds in the liv- 
ing cells of plants and animals. 

We have learned in other chapters of this volume 
that potatoes, fats and sugars in the processes of diges- 
tion form large amounts of poisonous acids, alkaloids 
and ptomaines, which become a most fruitful source of 
disease when not rapidly and thoroughly eliminated. 

The neutralization and elimination of these food 
poisons depend largely upon sodium. The ordinary 
American diet, consisting of meats, peas, beans, pota- 
toes, white bread, pastry, coffee and sugar, contains 
an excessive amount of the acid-producing food ele- 
ments, and only very small amounts of the eliminat- 
ing sodium. Fruits and vegetables, however, are very 
rich in organic sodium as well as all other positive 
alkaline mineral elements. Keeping in mind these 
premises, we shall see how both vegetarian and meat- 
eater may be right in their stand on the salt question. 

The vegetarian, whose daily dietary contains a lib- 
eral amount of uncooked fruits and vegetables and 
only moderate amounts of proteins and starches, has 
no need and no desire for inorganic table salt. His 



450 NATURAL DIETETICS 

demands for sodium are fully satisfied in a natural 
way by the organic sodium contained in the raw 
foods. 

On the other hand, people whose dietary consists 
largely of meats, potatoes, peas, beans, cereal foods, 
white flour bread and pastry, coffee, tea and refined 
sugar, all of which are lacking in the acid-binding 
sodium, must have table salt in order to make up the 
deficiency of this element in their food, therefore, 
they have a strong craving for the inorganic table 
salt. 

The foods above mentioned, as we have learned, pro- 
duce large amounts of poisonous acids and alkaloids, 
and unless these are promptly neutralized and elimi- 
nated by sqdium, disease and death would be the in- 
evitable results. Since the above described American 
dietary is deficient in the organic salts of fruits and 
vegetables, inorganic table salt (sodium chlorid) must 
serve as a poor substitute, but it is far better for the 
system to have the inorganic substitute than no sodium 
at all. 

The fact that many people have lived almost entirely 
on meats or cereal foods with table salt as seasoning, 
and have reached a ripe old age, indicates that the 
organism can use the inorganic salt as a substitute for 
the organic. 

We have learned that many elements, though con- 
genial to the body, when taken in the inorganic form 
show in the iris, but table salt, even when habitually 
taken in large quantities, does not show, indicating that 
we cannot class it among the poison foods. It is con- 
genial to the system, being naturally present in the 
blood, in organic combinations, in considerable quan- 
tities. Like uric acid, caffeine, theine, alcohol and 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 451 

nicotine, which also do not show in the iris by distinct 
signs, it becomes injurious to the system only when 
taken habitually in large quantities. Possibly table 
salt stands in closer relationship to the vito-chemical 
life element than other mineral substances which show 
in the iris. 

Table salt, however, should be used very moderately, 
even by meat eaters. Its excessive use easily becomes 
a habit. Its elimination greatly irritates the kidneys 
and withdraws from the blood large quantities of 
serum. This creates thirst, which necessitates the 
drinking of much water. This in turn dilutes the 
blood and other secretions of the organism, causing 
a watery dysaemia of all the vital fluids. 

Our flushing faddists seem to regard an excess of 
water in blood and tissues as a desirable condition, — 
our farmers know how to turn it into money. Salt, 
given to cattle and hogs, creates abnormal thirst. This 
causes excessive water drinking and watery dysaemia 
(anemia) ; watery blood makes fat. Thus, salt is 
turned into fat. 

Inorganic salt, when absorbed in large quantities, 
pickles the tissues. It destroys albuminous compounds 
and causes their excessive secretion in the urine (al- 
buminuria). Therefore, it leeches the protoplasm of 
the cells, weakening their resistance and breaking 
down their normal structures. 

This is shown clearly in scurvy, which is caused by 
excessive use of salt meats and lack of fresh vegetables 
(organic salts). This disease, which is characterized 
by decay and bleeding of the gums, proves that Nature 
limits the substitution of inorganic salt for the organic, 
and it strongly indicates that the organic is the most 
desirable form. 



452 • NATUR.Ui DIETETICS 

As soon as scurvy patients are put on a fruit and 
vegetable diet, the destruction of tissues, the bleeding 
resulting from it and other symptoms promptly abate. 
Another indication that inorganic sodiura-chlorid is 
not congenial to the system is indicated by the fact 
that considerable amounts of the organic salt contained 
in fruits and vegetables or in their extracts do not 
create thirst, while comparatively small amounts of 
the inorganic table salt cause irritation of the kidneys, 
great thirst, overwork, albuminuria, and weakening of 
the cell structure. These influences undoubtedly favor 
the development of kidney diseases. 

Now that we have considered the evidence for and 
against the use of salt, we shall endeavor to answer 
the question: Is it advisable for vegetarians to use 
salt? 

When the dietary contains liberal amounts of un- 
cooked fruits and vegetables, very little or no salt will 
be needed. The addition of salt is permissible to vege- 
tarian foods which contain large amounts of proteids, 
fats and starches, such as eggs, butter, peas, beans, 
lentils, potatoes, cereals, rice, etc. 

Vegetables of the fifth group when properly steamed 
in their own juices so that none of their mineral con- 
stituents are wasted, do not need additional condi- 
ments, their own salts are the best flavoring. 

In conclusion we must remember that fruits and 
vegetables often do not contain the normal amounts 
of organic salts, because for ages the soil on which they 
grow has been robbed of its mineral constituents. 

It is this deficiency in mineral elements which lowers 
the resistance of vegetables, grains and fruits, impairs 
their development, causes decay and facilitates the 
work of destructive worms, insects and germs, just 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 453 

as lowered resistance favors the development of germs 
and bacteria in human bodies. 

Nitrogenous fertilizers have been provided plenti- 
fully, but the necessity of positive mineral fertilizers 
was never thought of until Julius Hensel, the "Nature 
Cure" food chemist, called attention to the fact. 

The soil and its products, therefore, as well as human 
beings, suffer from mineral starvation. African ex- 
.plorers state that in certain parts of Africa the soil 
and its products are lacking in sodium-chlorid, and 
that in these sections animals and human beings suffer 
from salt starvation, which expresses itself in many 
curious ways. 

The following clipping from a daily paper is of 
interest in this connection: 

Region of Salt Famine 

"All living creatures in this region are crazy for 
salt, just like oxen on a 'sour' veldt. Salt is far the 
best coinage you can take among the Chibokwe. I 
do not mean our white table salt. They reject that 
with scorn, thinking it is sugar or something equally 
useless, but for the coarse and dirty 'bay salt' they 
will sell almost anything, and a pinch of it is a greater 
treat to a child than a whole bride cake would be in 
England. 

' ' 1 have tested it especially with the bees that swarm 
in these forests and produce most of the beeswax that 
goes to Europe. I first noticed their love of salt when 
I salted some water one afternoon in the vain hope of 
curing the poisoned sores on my feet. In half an 
hour the swarms of bees had driven me from my tent. 
I was stung ten times and had to wait about in the 



454 NATURAL DIETETICS 

forest till the sun set, when the bees vanished as if by 
signal. 

' * Another afternoon I tested them by putting a heap 
of sugar, a paper smeared with condensed milk and a 
bag of salt tightly wrapped up in tar-paper side by 
side on the ground. I gave them twenty minutes, and 
then I found nothing on the sugar, five flies on the 
milk, and the tar-paper so densely covered with bees 
that they overlapped each other as when they swarm. 
For want of anything better, they will fight over a 
sweaty shirt in the same way, and once, by the banks 
of a stream, they sent all my carriers howling along 
the path by creeping up under their loin-cloths. The 
butterflies seek salt also. If you spread out a damp 
rag anywhere in tropical Africa, you will soon have 
brilliant butterflies on it. But if you add a little salt 
in the Hungary Coimtry the rug will be a blaze of 
colors, unless the bees come and drive the butterflies 
off. 

Bum Grass for Substitute 

"As I said, the natives feel the longing, too. Among 
the Chibokwe the women burn a marsh grass into a 
potash powder as a substitute; and if a native squats 
down in front of you, puts out a long pink tongue and 
strokes it appealingly with his finger, you may know 
it is salt he wants." 

The addition of small quantities of table salt to a 
vegetarian diet is, therefore not to be condemned, 
but its use should be confined to butter, eggs and 
such cooked foods as we have mentioned. 

Do not use it at the table, except on eggs. It is 
barbaric to kill with salt and pepper the delicate flavors 
of fruits and vegetables. But, says our friend, the 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 455 

meat-eater, "I have to add condiments and spices, or 
I cannot taste anything." To this we answer, "N) 
wonder, when the taste buds in your tongue are par- 
alyzed by salt, pepper, mustard, strong condiments, 
nicotine and alcohol. Return to a natural diet and 
your nerves of taste will soon regain their normal sen- 
sitiveness. Then you will enjoy the beautiful flavors 
of fruits and vegetables and things will taste as good 
as 'when mother made them.' " 

In summing up and comparing our evidence, we come 
to the conclusion that here, as elsewhere, it is not well 
to run into extremes. As usual the middle, common- 
sense way is the safest way. 

Fermented Bread 

Vegetarians, almost unanimously, condemn the use 
of fermented bread. Are the lightened loaves as inju- 
rious as they claim? 

The enemies of fermented bread usually advance the 
following arguments : 

1st. Fermented bread contains yeast germs, which 
enter the digestive organs and cause injurious fer- 
mentation. 

2nd. Fermented bread contains alcohol, which is in- 
jurious to health and life. 

3rd. The "raising" of the bread is due to gases 
"arising from the decaying bodies of dead yeast 
germs. ' ' 

4th. The transformation of the sugar in the fer- 
menting dough entails a considerable loss of elements 
of nutrition. 

We shall take up these objections one by one and 
examine them as to their validity. 



456 NATURAL DIETETICS 

First objection: "Fermented bread contains yeast 
germs, which enter the digestive organs and cause 
injurious fermentation." 

Pasteur discovered that all yeast germs die at a tem- 
perature of about 150° F. Every housewife takes ad- 
vantage of this fact when she heats milk and fruit 
preserves to the Pasteurizing or germ-killing tempera- 
ture. How, then, can the yeast germ survive the great 
heat of the bake oven, which ranges from 500° to 
1,000° F. ? But suppose a few yeast cells survive the 
heat of the fiery oven and enter the human body — 
what of it? Physiology teaches us that the various 
processes of digestion are completed in the intestinal 
canal by germ fermentation. 

In order to understand what this means we must 
consider for a moment what fermentation is. Web- 
ster's Imperial Dictionary defines it as follows: "The 
conversion of an organic substance into new com- 
pounds in presence of a ferment, the nature of which 
determines the kind of fermentation produced. Fer- 
mentation may be checked or altogether prevented by 
anything which prevents the growth of the fungi, as 
by keeping away from the liquid the spores of germs, 
by the liquid being either too hot or too cold for their 
development, by the liquid containing too much sugar, 
or by the presence of a substance (called an anti- 
septic) which acts as a poison on the fungi." 

Ferments are classified into encymes and fungi. The 
former are chemical compounds, the latter are live 
vegetable spores or germs. 

The most important chemical encymes in the body 
are the ptyaline of the saliva, which transforms 
starches into dextrines and sugars, the pepsin in the 
stomach which transforms proteids into peptones, and 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 457 

the pancreatic ferments which act upon all food classes. 
Whatever in the processes of digestion is left undone 
by these and other chemical encymes is completed 
in the intestinal canal by fungoid and bacterial fer- 
mentations. The intestinal tract is alive with fungi 
of the yeast type and with microbes and bacilli of all 
sorts, which carry on the work of fermentation and 
oxydation until all food materials are split up into 
the simplest possible elements and compounds. 

From this it will be seen that all the processes of 
digestion from beginning to end are in a way processes 
of fermentation.* "What difference, then, can it make 
if a few additional yeast germs enter the body with 
the bread? 

Second objection: "Bread fermentation creates al- 
cohol, which in injurious to health and life." 

So does the healthy human body manufacture al- 
cohol. It is produced by the action of yeast germs on 
sugar in the intestinal tract. The oxydation of food 
materials and of waste matter is in many other 
instances accompanied by the formation of alcohol. 
This product is, therefore, in small quantities, con- 
genial to the system and plays a useful part in the vital 
activities. Like uric acid and other systemic waste 
matter and poisons it becomes dangerous to health and 
life only when present in excessive quantities. 

Alcohol is easily combustible and acts as fuel mate- 



* Dr. Th. Powell, whose theories we have discussed In other places, 
also claims that digestion is not fermentation, but simple disintegration. 
If tills Is so, how does he explain the change of starch into sugar under 
the influence of the ferments, ptyalln and amylopsin, of fats Into 
glycerine and fatty acids in the presence of steapsin, etc., etc.? These 
changes certainly involve "the conversion of organic substances into 
new compounds in the presence of digestive ferments (enzymes)." 
We cannot see why "disintegration" is an improvement on the term 
"fermentation." We understand the latter Involves the former. 



458 NATURAL DIETETICS 

rial to the system. When present in large quantities, 
however, it paralyzes the inhibitory nervous apparatus 
and burns up nerve fats too rapidly, thereby causing 
temporary over-stimulation and resultant weakness and 
exhaustion. 

Alcohol is created in the fermenting dough in 
minute quantities only, and most of it evaporates in 
the great heat of the oven. Large London bakeries 
endeavored to collect and condense the alcohol from 
the ovens, but the expense attached to this process 
proved greater than the returns and the experiment 
was therefore abandoned. 

Chemical tests of finished bread show alcohol in 
traces only. There is not enough of it to injure the 
human organism in any way or manner. 

Third objection: "The 'raising' of the bread is 
due to the gas arising from the decaying bodies of 
dead yeast germs." 

In the first place, dead yeast germs have never been 
known to create carbonic acid gas in considerable 
quantities. They have to be alive in order to do so. 
Yeast fungi, while living on sugar, digest or split up 
the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid gas. This 
gas while escaping permeates the dough with air pas- 
sages and bubbles and in that way raises and lightens 
it. This loosening of the dough into a sponge-like 
mass favors the escape of moisture and the penetra- 
tion of heat. The resulting bread is therefore baked 
more thoroughly and keeps much better, does not sour 
so quickly, and is more easily digested than much of 
the soggy, lumpy, ''unfermented health bread." 

This carbonic acid gas which lightens the bread can- 
not be very injurious as it is the same gas that sparkles 
and bubbles in soda water and in all other effervescent 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 459 

drinks. When taken as a free gas into the stomach 
in food or drink, it rapidly evaporates, and while 
escaping creates that cooling, prickling and refreshing 
sensation peculiar to carbonated beverages. 

Fourth objection: ''The transformation of sugar in 
the fermenting dough entails a considerable loss in 
elements of nutrition." 

This loss of sugar incidental to bread fermentation 
is so small that it hardly merits consideration. This 
small loss is more than balanced by increased digesti- 
bility and palatableness and by better keeping qual- 
ities. 

What has been said will make it apparent that the 
fermentation of the bread is in a way a process of 
predigestion. In fact, all so-called ''predigested" 
health foods have been subjected to some process of 
fermentation, for in this way only is it possible to 
"predigest" food materials. 

This, however, is not altogether an advantage. Pre- 
digestion dissipates food energy outside of the body 
which should be liberated and utilized inside of the 

Mono-Diet 

The latest development in dietetic treatment is the 
mono-diet. Strictly speaking, this regime consists in 
taking but one article of food at a meal, a succession 
of meals, or continuously for a considerable period 
of time. 

The mono-diet, like the grape cure, milk cure, raw 
food diet, Salisbury raw meat diet, fasting, Fletcher- 
izing, and other forms of radical and one-sided die- 
tetic treatment, when applied temporarily, may have 
very beneficial effects on certain diseased conditions, 
and for the attainment of special results. But it is 



460 NATURAL DIETETICS 

not advisable to prescribe or to follow these extreme 
regimes indiscriminately, in all kinds of cases, and for 
indefinite periods of time. The trouble is that enthusi- 
asts look upon such methods as cure-alls, applying 
them to all kinds of cases and conditions, and thereby 
often inflicting lasting injuries instead of benefiting 
those who entrust themselves to their care. Because 
these extreme practices are beneficial in some cases 
their advocates jump to the conclusion that they will 
prove efficacious under all circumstances. 

One of the principal objections to the mono-diet is 
that not one article of food, with the exception of 
milk and red blood, contains in right proportions all 
the elements required by the body. All the foods of 
the first four groups as shown in our tables of food 
analysis (pp. 430 and 431) contain too much of the 
negative, acid forming elements and not enough of 
the positive mineral salts, while the foods of the fifth 
group contain enough of the positive mineral elements 
but not enough of the heating and building materials. 
Any extreme, one-sided diet, therefore, must in the 
long run necessarily lead to unbalanced and abnormal 
conditions in the system. 

Furthermore, mono-diet means monotony, and mo- 
notony in eating, as in many other things, is not 
conducive to health, happiness and longevity. Natu- 
rally, we crave variety in our foods as well as in our 
surroundings and occupations. Mono-tony — sameness 
of tone — is not harmony, therefore not pleasing, and 
if long continued it becomes annoying and destructive. 
Desire for food and the keen enjoyment of it depend 
upon at least moderate variety. Keen appetite and 
hunger insure copious secretion of the digestive juices 
and ferments. This has been proved by the experi- 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 461 

ments of viviseetionists. Through tubes inserted into 
the stomachs of dogs, they collected digestive juices. 
And it was found that these began to flow more freely 
when the animals were shown some appetizing morsels 
of food. Food which they did not like, or were in- 
different to, failed to stimulate the secretions in the 
same degree. When the animals were excited to fear 
or anger the secretions were greatly diminished, or 
ceased to flow entirely. 

We often hear people say they cannot eat a certain 
food because at one time they "got too much of it." 
My secretary tells me as we are working on this manu- 
script, that once, it being known by a certain gracious 
country hostess of hers, that she was especially fond 
of whipped cream, she was fed on whipped-cream cake, 
whipped-cream pie, and whipped cream in every other 
conceivable form, morning, noon and night, until for 
a long time afterward she could scarcely bear the sight 
of it. Monotony had created a revulsion of her appe- 
tite toward a perfectly wholesome and inviting food. 
Similar experiences are related to me frequently by 
patients, confirming my opinion that mono-diet is not 
a natural practice. The originators and enthusiastic 
advocates of such systems may adhere to them indefi- 
nitely with apparent success, but the majority of peo- 
ple will soon tire of living on a straight **one food 
at a time" diet. 

We repeat that in many cases where we had to 
counteract a certain form of systemic poisoning we 
have found the mono-diet very beneficial, as, for in- 
stance, the grape cure or the milk cure in uric acid 
diseases. In such cases the mono-diet constitutes a 
mild form of protein starvation, which is desirable 
under the circumstances. 



462 NATURAL DIETETICS 

But when patients are already physically and men- 
tally weak and negative, have lost ambition and energy, 
together with appetite, all such extremes as fasting, 
raw food diet and mono-diet may become positively 
harmful and lead to nervous prostration, abnormal 
psyehism and insanity. 

No radical or extreme form of diet or other method 
of treatment should ever be undertaken except under 
the advice and guidance of a competent physician, who 
is capable of taking into consideration the various 
aspects and requirements of the case. 

Mastication 

Thorough mastication of food is an absolute neces- 
sity to insure good digestion, but, like every other 
good thing, can be overdone. In his "A-B-C of Nutri- 
tion," Horace Fletcher advocates mastication of food 
until it is reduced to a fluid condition. While I 
believe that "Fletcherizing" has benefited many people 
suffering from overeating and consequent food poison- 
ing, I know also that in many instances it has become 
positively harmful. Food in the liquid state does not 
offer enough resistance to the muscles of the intestinal 
tract. 

Stomach and intestines need some bulky, solid food 
as a stimulus to peristalsis, the propelling movement 
peculiar to the digestive organs. If all food be con- 
verted into a liquid before it enters the stomach the 
peristaltic movements of the digestive tract become 
ineffective through disuse, the bowels become "lazy" 
and inactive as they do under a milk diet. 

Furthermore, a good many people, myself amongf 
them, simply cannot afford the time to *'Fletcherize." 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 463 

To do this would require an hour or more each meal. 
Instead of spending this time at the table trying to 
reduce the cellulose and wood-fiber of fruits and vege- 
tables to a liquid, thereby destroying their stimulating 
effect upon the stomach and intestines, it would be 
much more beneficial to take fifteen to thirty minutes 
after each meal for relaxation, rest and vital regen- 
eration. This is especially to be recommended to 
people with very weak digestions. When they are 
thoroughly relaxed and at rest they should, by an effort 
of will, concentrate the blood and nerve currents on 
the work of the digestive organs. 

Frequency of Meals 

The frequency of meals cannot be determined by 
hard-and-fast rules. Different factors must be taken 
into account: occupation, physical condition, the cir- 
cumstances in the home, etc. As a rule the two-meal 
plan is the best. The ideal way is to have breakfast 
between nine and ten o'clock in the morning and dinner 
between five and six in the afternoon. This allows 
sufficient time for thorough digestion and assimilation. 

In our experience, the no-breakfast plan does not 
agree with most people. Putting off the first meal 
until noon is likely to create excessive hunger and a 
tendency to overeating. It also brings the noon-day 
meal and the evening meal too close together. 

If circumstances are such that breakfast has to be 
taken early in the day and dinner late in the evening, 
it may be found advisable to eat a light lunch at noon 
consisting, say, of fruit and a few nuts, or a vegetable 
salad, or some whole-grain bread and a glass of milk. 

Some of our friends and patients get along best on 



464 NATURAL DIETETICS 

one meal a day. This is especially advisable where 
there is a tendency to overeating and to excessive fat 
and flesh formation. 

In certain isolated cases of an exceptionally weak 
and negative condition we have found it expedient to 
give small quantities of food three or four times a 
day. 

Drinking 

We are not in favor of excessive drinking. The 
"flushing-of-the-system" fad is a mistake. The purifi- 
cation of the body is not a mechanical process like 
the flushing of a sewer Avith water. It is a chemical 
process which depends upon the normal composition and 
concentration of the different secretions in the system. 
These secretions, the most important one of which is 
the blood, cannot be made more effective by diluting 
them with large amounts of water. 

Most of the people suffering from stubborn chronic 
constipation that come to us for treatment have been 
' ' flushing ' ' for years, through mouth and rectum, using 
quarts and even gallons of water daily, with the result 
that they were getting more constipated all the time. 
On our comparatively dry-food diet the bowels, in most 
cases, begin to act normally within a short time. 

Distilled Water 

Another popular fallacy is the idea that on account 
of its absolute purity distilled water is wholesome. 
As a matter of fact, its very purity makes it injurious 
to the system. 

All water has a natural tendency to saturate itself, 
up to a certain point, with mineral matter. Good drink- 
ing water always contains a certain amount of mineral 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 465 

matter. When this is removed through distillation, 
the water will leech from the system the organic min- 
eral salts which play such an important part in the 
vital processes of our bodies, and which we find it is so 
difficult to supply in sufficient amounts. Good drink- 
ing water is agreeable to the taste, whereas the 
absence of mineral salts accounts for the flat taste of 
distilled water. 

On the other hand, very large quantities of lime, iron, 
sulphur, or other inorganic, minerals in water that is 
used constantly for drinking or bathing, are injurious 
to the system. If such minerals are present in excess, 
the water should be boiled and allowed to settle before 
it, is used. 

If the water contains vegetable or animal organic 
matter it should be filtered. 

It is the customary highly-spiced meat and egg diet 
which creates excessive or abnormal thirst. A rational 
non-irritating and non-stimulating vegetarian diet 
furnishes the organism with fluids of the best possi- 
ble kind in the form of fruit and vegetable juices, 
prepared in Nature's own laboratory, rich in medicinal 
qualities and free from all objectionable constituents. 

Under ordinary conditions, drink from four to eight 
glasses of pure water at ordinary temperature in the 
course of the day, according to your own individual 
inclination: in the morning before breakfast, at night 
before going to bed, and at intervals during the day. 

Drinking at Meals 

The less you drink with your meals the better. The 
dryness of the food furnishes the necessary stimulus to 
the secretion of saliva and of gastric and intestinal 
juices. 



466 NATURAL DIETETICS 

An abundance of liquid in the digestive tract inter- 
feres with the action of the secreting glands. More- 
over, it dilutes the secretions and thereby weakens 
their digestive qualities. The juices of the stomach 
and the intestines cannot be made more effective by 
adding to them large amounts of water at meal time. 

Coffee and tea or alcoholic drinks should be espe- 
cially avoided at meals. The former retard digestion ; 
the latter overstimulate temporarily the secretion o£ 
gastric and intestinal juices, and this unnatural stimu- 
lation is followed by corresponding weakness and in- 
activity of the secreting glands in the digestive tract. 
Liquor taken before and during meals, therefore, en- 
courages overeating, and when the reaction sets in, the 
secretions as well as the vitality are lacking in strength 
to digest properly the excess of food taken under the 
influence of unnatural stimulation. 

A glass of water taken from one-half to one hour 
before meals will, in most cases, do away with the 
desire to drink at meal-time. However, if there be 
actual thirst it must be satisfied. If you prefer a warm 
drink you may take cereal coffee, or warm milk, or 
(sparingly) cocoa. Skimmed milk, buttermilk and 
juices diluted with water are good cold drinks. 

Mixing Starches With Acid Fruits and Vegetables 

Many dietists lay great stress on the fact that acid 
fruit juices retard or prevent the digestion of starchy 
foods in the stomach. Therefore, they advise that these 
foods should never be taken together at the same meal. 
"We find that this rule, also, does not hold good in aU 
cases. 

It is true, a great many people cannot eat starchy 
foods and acids together at the same meal, without 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 467 

experiencing serious digestive disturbances and aggra- 
vation of chronic symptoms. This is especially true 
of those who suffer with hyper-acidity of the stomach 
and catarrhal ailments. The latter surely are often 
caused by "starch poisoning," due to putrefying 
starchy materials in the digestive tract. On the other 
hand, many of our people do not seem to experience 
any bad effects from the mixing of starches with fruit 
and vegetable acids. This is especially true of those 
who incline to hypo-acidity, and who take good care to 
thoroughly masticate and insalivate the starchy foods 
before they swallow them. 

While with some people fruit and vegetable acids 
seem to increase the acidity of the stomach, with a 
great many others they antidote acidity. I, myself, 
belong to the latter class. For years I suffered severely 
from hyper-acidity, and I always found acid fruit the 
best cure. Often I had to arise in the middle of the 
night, suffering intensely from acidity of the stomach. 
A few oranges would always give relief. 

The alkaline elements of juicy fruits neutralize the 
hyper-acidity of the stomach and the blood. However, 
in all cases where the mixing of these foods causes the 
least trouble it certainly should be avoided. Such 
people should take with their breakfast cereals, sweet, 
alkaline fruits only, such as dates, figs, raisins, stcAved 
prunes, sweet grapes and melons in season. They 
should take the acid fruits by themselves, for the noon- 
day lunch, or if they have the heavy meal of the day 
at noon, they should have nothing but acid fruits or 
vegetables for breakfast, or between breakfast and 
the noon-day dinner. 

The acid fruits and vegetables may be taken together 
■with dairy products, fats or protein foods, such as 



468 NATURE CURE COOK BOOK 

milk, buttermilk, cream, cheese, honey, milk, eggs, 
meat and nuts. 

The acid foods should be avoided, also, at the heavy 
meal of the day, consisting of starches, fats, proteins 
and alkaline vegetables. Some acid finiit may be taken 
before retiring. 

It is good practice for everybody to have one meal 
of the day consist entirely of juicy fruits and vegeta- 
bles, so as to give full sway to their purifying effects 
upon the system, undisturbed by other kinds of food. 

Theoretically, the mono-diet is correct. I believe it 
would be best to take each of the five classes of foods 
by itself, so as to avoid interference from other foods 
in the digestive processes. But this would be difficult 
to carry out in actual practice, for the reasons we 
have discussed in other places. 

It is impossible to make hard and fast general rules, 
as long as the human family is afflicted with so many 
varying digestive troubles. If all were normal, the 
normal diet outlined in "Natural Dietetics" would do 
for all, with slight variations. But during the period 
of reconstruction and recovery from chronic digestive 
ailments, the diet will have to be adapted to the indi- 
vidual requirements. 

Corroborative Evidence of the Importance of the Posi- 
tive Mineral Elements in the Vital Economy 

The importance of positive, alkaline mineral ele- 
ments in the vital economy is indicated by the remark- 
able tonic effects of saline solutions on living animal 
and human tissues. 

Salts are compounds in which the hydrogen has been 
replaced by positive alkaline mineral elements. These 



MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES 469 

positive mineral elements are therefore present in all 
salts. 

It is now a well known fact that salt solutions in- 
jected into the rectum have a decided tonic effect, in 
grave depression or suspended animation resulting 
from shock, great loss of blood, surgical operations, or 
other profound influences on the nervous system. Sa- 
line solutions greatly stimulate the growth and activity 
of animal cells, even when detached from the parent 
organism. This is true, not only of single cells, but 
also of entire organs, as has been determined by actual 
experiments. 

For instance, the hearts of frogs, rabbits, and other 
laboratory animals will continue to beat when sub- 
merged in a saline solution, for a considerable length 
of time after they have been removed from the 
organism to which they belong. This seems to indicate 
a close relationship between the positive mineral ele- 
ments contained in the salts and the activities of the 
life elements in animal and human bodies. These tonic 
effects of the salts of positive mineral elements explain 
why the latter have a positive effect upon the system, 
while the foods composed entirely of negative acid 
forming elements, produce negative effects.

When people are normal, a normal diet as outlined 
in "Natural Dietetics" is fully sufficient to keep them 
in perfect condition, but while suffering from chronic 
ailments of the digestive organs, and while passing 
through healing crises brought about by natural living 
and treatment, the diet has to be adapted to changing 
conditions and requirements.
