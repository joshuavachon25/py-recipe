|E take this opportunity of presenting 
to the American Housewife a col- 
lection of recipes which have to 
do with a class of food products but little 
known. The dietetic value of such fruits as 
dates, figs, currants, etc., is a high one and 
these fruits should appear on our tables at 
least once a day. 

The brands mentioned are all standard 
and some of them have been on the market 
for the last twenty-five years. The recipes 
are all based on the use of the best grades 
of the various products and these brands stand 
for the highest quality as well as for absolute 
cleanliness of pack. Any good fruit dealer or 
grocer can supply them. 

The recipes which we have published in 
this little book have been selected from a 
large number submitted in our prize contest 
held in 1910. They have been thoroughly tested 
and we hope will meet with the approval of 
all who have occasion to use them.

3 cupfuls of water. 

7 tabl'espoonfuls of vinegar. 

3 tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. 

5 whole cloves. 

Put the currants, water and cloves on to boil. Cook until the 
currants are soft enough to mash with a spoon, then take from the 
fire, mash enough to break the skins, add the vinegar and sugar and 
cook until thick. Let the sauce cool and serve with cold meats. It will 
keep for some tune. 

CHILI SAUCE 

12 ripe tomatoes. 

12 large apples. 

12 green peppers (bell peppers). 

6 large onions. 

1 Ib. Eoyal Excelsior cleaned currants. 

1 Ib. Camel Brand figs. 

1/2 cup sugar. 

1 tablespoonful salt. 

1/2 teaspoonful cayenne pepper (scant). 

2 teaspoonfuls ground ginger. 
1 quart vinegar. 

Peel tomatoes and onions; peel and core apples; place onions, 
apples, peppers and figs in a chopping bowl and chop fine (or run them 
through a food chopper) ; add currants, sugar, salt and spices, and boil 
one hour. 

A NEW USE FOR CURRANTS 

When making pot roast with beef, add a cupful of currants. They 
will improve the appearance of the roast and impart a delicious flavor. 

CURRANT CONSERVE 

1 pint red currant juice. 

2 pounds Eoyal Excelsior currants. 

3 pounds Royal Excelsior raisins seeded and chopped. 

4 pounds sugar.

Equal quantity of stoned Dromedary dates. 
Sugar to taste. 

Cook until dates are tender. Serve either hot or cold. 



DATE-OLIVE BUTTER OR CREAM 

Dates, olive oil, lemon juices, salt, spice. 

Take fresh dates or moist dried ones. Remove pits; press fruit 
through colander. Place in small mixing bowl or deep cup. Add olive 
oil, teaspoonful at a time and rub or stir till thoroughly blended. Oil 
to the amount of half or more of the bulk of fruit pulp may be added 
as desired. If too stiff, thin with water or lemon juice. The consistency 
may be varied according to use desired. Salt or spice may be added to 
taste. 

Use in place of butter on toast; or as a sauce with pudding. Olive 
oil is more palatable and digestible in such emulsion than clear. 

Other fruit pulp may be treated in the same way. Stewed prunes, 
using no juice, are perhaps next best to dates.

30 



FRUIT AND NUT CARAMELS 

Take equal portions of nut meats, Camel Brand figs and Dromedary 
dates, and pass through the meat grinder. Mix together thoroughly and 
place in a square shallow baking tin and pack down tight and even, using 
a rolling pin or the blade of a broad knife. When packed the layer 
should be about three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut in squares and wrap 
in oiled paper. 



FIG BRITTLE 

Melt one pound white sugar in granite saucepan, have one-half 
pound of figs chopped fine, stir them in the melted sugar and pour in pan 
one inch thick. Cut in strips and serve. 



DATE DAINTIES FOR TRAVELERS 

Stone as many Dromedary dates as desired, stuff with broken Eng- 
lish walnut meats, pecan halves, bits of candied ginger, candied pineapple, 
roasted almonds and fondant flavored with juice of lemon. Eoll each 
one in granulated or powdered sugar. Pack in layers, in a tin box, cov- 
ering each layer with paraffin paper. These will keep indefinitely and 
are nourishing. 



GOLF BALLS 

Take a pound each of Dromedary dates, Camel Brand, figs and 
English walnuts. Wash figs, stone dates and grind through meat grinder 
.to a fine pulp, then add the nuts, chopped almost to a powder, and mix 
all thoroughly together. Mold the paste into balls, the size of golf balls,

cut into squares. 

31 



CREAMED DATES 

Butter. 

Confectioner's sugar. 

Finely chopped Dromedary Dates. 

Cream together butter and sugar as for hard sauce. Add dates. 
The mass may be mounded upon a dish, or made into small confections 
and rolled in granulated sugar. The latter is preferable if a confection 
is desired, but since this is a delicious sauce as an accompaniment to a 
Christmas pudding, the simple loaf is most easily handled. When used 
as a confection, a variation may be reached by rolling some of the bits 
in Gilt Edge shredded cocoanut instead of in granulated sugar. 



STUFFED DATES 

}4 cup granulated sugar. 
y^ cup milk. 

Place in saucepan and boil rapidly without stirring. Keep sides of 
pan free from granules. When a soft ball forms in cold water, pour 
cream on a shallow platter. Beat with a wooden fork until stiff. Then 
stir in % cup of shaved walnut or pecan meats and mold quickly with 
hands into a sheet, one-quarter inch thick. While cooling, stone a 
dozen Dromedary dates. Cut from the fondant with a sharp knife a 
piece as long as a date and one-quarter inch wide. Press into the date 
and press date naturally around its imitation stone. Serve soon.

FIG SYRUP 

Cut one pound of Camel Brand figs into small bits and put them 
into a wide mouthed jar containing one pint of Holland gin. Take one 
teaspoonful occasionally.

HINTS ON USING CITRON 

Set the citron in the oven before slicing, until heated through. It 
will then not gum on the knife, but can be sliced with ease and swift- 
ness. 

For a pleasing change, substitute citron in any recipe calling for 
raisins. 

It is a great improvement to a loaf of plain white cake to add a 
cup of diced and floured citron. 

For the daintiest cake decoration imaginable make stems and leaves 
of citron and use bits of candied cherries for buds and flowers. Cut 
thread-like strips off the outside of the citron its greenest part for the 
long stems which should be artistically arranged on the iced cake. Then 
cut thin oval bits of green citron to simulate leaves, and arrange on 
the stem. Make short stems branching off, to which the flowers may 
be joined.
